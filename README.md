# mmRAG: A Modular Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Text, Tables, and Knowledge Graphs

This repository provides the code for the paper **"mmRAG: A Modular Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Text, Tables, and Knowledge Graphs"**.

## ðŸ”— Data

The mmRAG dataset is avaliable at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Askio/mmrag_benchmark).

## mmRAG Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, existing RAG evaluation predominantly focuses on text retrieval and relies on opaque, end-to-end assessments of generated outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce mmRAG, a modular benchmark designed for evaluating multi-modal RAG systems. Our benchmark integrates queries from six diverse question-answering datasets spanning text, tables, and knowledge graphs, which we uniformly convert into retrievable documents. To enable direct, granular evaluation of individual RAG componentsâ€”such as the accuracy of retrieval and query routingâ€”beyond end-to-end generation quality, we follow standard information retrieval procedures to annotate document relevance and derive dataset relevance. We establish baseline performance by evaluating a wide range of RAG implementations on mmRAG.

In this repository, we provide our source code for constructing mmRAG dataset and evaluating experienmens provided in our paper.

Note: Due to randomness of LLM generation, the queries selected may not completely the same with our current dataset.

### Source Dataset download

In mmRAG, we use NQ, TriviaQA, OTT, TAT, CWQ, WebQSP as data sources. 

NQ and TriviaQA can be accessed from HuggingFace, using `load_dataset()` provided by `dataset` package.

[OTT](https://github.com/wenhuchen/OTT-QA) and [TAT](https://nextplusplus.github.io/TAT-QA/) datasets can be downloaded from there websites.

[CWQ](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/nqujvpg2gc4y0ozkw3wgr/AOzjVEsdUhv2Fx2pamfJlSw?rlkey=746t7xehfqxf1zr867nxiq8aq&e=1), [WebQSP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-value-of-semantic-parse-labeling-for-knowledge-base-question-answering-2/), and the [Knowledge Graph (Freebase)](https://github.com/dki-lab/Freebase-Setup) can be downloaded and setup following [ChatKBQA](https://github.com/LHRLAB/ChatKBQA):

[dataset_loader.py](./filter/dataset_loader.py) provides the basic functions to load and process the datasets. After your downloading all these datasets and start the Freebase SPARQL dump, modify all the `dataset_path` and path in `load_dataset` function in the corresponding class. For CWQ_reader and   WebQSP_reader, the `kb_dump` path also need to be filled. You can try to run `dataset_loader.py` to test whether all datasets are correctly loaded.

### Query Selection, Documents Representation and Collection

Run [filter.py](./filter/filter.py) to generate queries for each source dataset and corresponding documents and ramdom chaos socuments.

Run [gen_documents.py](./document_processer/gen_documents.py) to chunk documents.
