                "Key Information Matching": "The document provides detailed information about Belgium, which is the country referenced in the answer, but it does not address the query's focus on Belgium using the euro as its main currency.",

                "Explanation": "While the document provides extensive information about Belgium, it does not mention the euro or currency directly. Therefore, it cannot directly answer the query but offers partially relevant context given the query's answer (Belgium) is within the document's scope of content."
