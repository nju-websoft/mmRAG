                "Answer Analysis": "The answer specifies that Canada's capital is located in Ontario.",
                "Document Content Analysis": "The document provides historical information about Ottawa, including its selection as the permanent capital of the Province of Canada in 1857 by Queen Victoria. It also mentions Ottawa being approximately midway between Toronto and Kingston in Canada West, which aligns with what is now Ontario.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document mentions 'Canada', 'capital', and 'Province of Canada', indirectly referencing Ottawa as the capital.",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document includes indirect geographical references to Ontario, such as 'Canada West' and nearby cities like 'Toronto' and 'Kingston', which are located in Ontario.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The document provides contextual information about Ottawa being in 'Canada West', which was historically part of what is now Ontario. It also mentions nearby cities in Ontario to validate the geographic location of Ottawa.",
