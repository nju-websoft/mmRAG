                "Explanation": "The document provides tangentially relevant information, listing Afghanistan as a country that exports to the UK, but it does not directly answer the query or include the specific information about Madagascar. It is partially relevant because it touches upon the topic of UK imports but lacks the detailed or specific information required for a comprehensive answer."
