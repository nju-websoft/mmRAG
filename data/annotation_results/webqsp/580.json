While it doesn't directly answer who currently runs the Cornelia Marie, it provides information about its ownership, which is closely related to its operation. The document mentions Josh Harris as an owner, which could be useful context for understanding the vessel's management, even though it doesn't confirm the current operator. The discrepancy between the document (mentioning Josh Harris) and the answer (Jake Harris) suggests there might be more recent changes or additional information not captured in this document. Therefore, while not fully answering the query, the document offers valuable, related information, making it partially relevant."
