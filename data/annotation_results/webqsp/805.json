                "Answer Analysis": "The answer provided is 'Looking at the World through Michael Jackson's Left Eye (Part 2)', which appears unrelated to the query or the context of the Harlem Renaissance.",
                "Document Content Analysis": "The document primarily discusses Zora Neale Hurston's writings, including plays, essays, poetry, short stories, and novels. It emphasizes the folkloric foundation of her work and explores topics such as social problems, self-identity, dislocation, and the use of heavy black English dialect. Hurston's perspective is compared with other black writers like Richard Wright, and references are made to scholarly debates about whether her works belong to the Harlem Renaissance literature canon.",
