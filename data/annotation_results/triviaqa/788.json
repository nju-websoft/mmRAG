As toxicology tests on Goulart’s body begin, explore 10 of history’s most famous exhumations.\n1. Jesse James\nThe infamous Wild West outlaw may have died in 1882, but his legend lived on—as did persistent rumors that James faked his own death. Although it was widely accepted that fellow gang member Bob Ford shot and killed James to collect the bounty on his head, some speculated that Ford had actually murdered another man to assist James in his ruse, a claim boosted when a 100-year-old man named J. Frank Dalton came forward in 1948 saying he was the real Jesse James. In 1995, the James family requested the exhumation of their ancestor’s corpse from a Kearney, Missouri, cemetery, and DNA tests confirmed the remains were indeed those of the outlaw.\n2. Eva Peron\nAfter the death of Argentina’s beloved first lady in 1952, Peron’s embalmed body was put on display inside a Buenos Aires trade union headquarters until an enormous mausoleum could be constructed. The Argentine military leaders who seized power from Juan Peron in 1955 feared the symbolic power of his wife’s corpse, so they hid it in locations around the city that included a movie theater and water works. In 1957, Peron was secretly buried in Milan, Italy under the assumed name “Maria Maggi.” Fourteen years later, Evita’s body was exhumed and moved to Madrid, where her husband lived in exile. Finally in 1974, her remains were returned to Buenos Aires and buried in a fortified crypt in La Recoleta Cemetery.\n3. Abraham Lincoln\nIn 1876 a gang of Chicago counterfeiters hatched a scheme to snatch the slain president’s body from his tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois, and hold the corpse for a ransom of $200,000 and the release of their best engraver from prison. After law enforcement officials thwarted the grave robbers in the middle of the crime, Lincoln’s body was quickly moved to various unmarked graves until it was eventually encased in a steel cage and entombed under 10 feet of concrete in the same Springfield cemetery in 1901.\n4. John Wilkes Booth\nThe man who murdered Lincoln also had his final resting place disturbed. After the Union Army killed Booth during the manhunt for the presidential assassin, his body was buried inside the Washington Arsenal in the national capital. In 1869, the Booth family disinterred the assassin and buried him in a family plot in Baltimore’s Green Mount Cemetery. (To answer persistent rumors that Booth actually escaped the manhunt, family members are split on whether to exhume the body of his brother Edwin to obtain DNA samples to compare with vertebrae purported to be the assassin’s stored at the National Museum of Health and Medicine.)\n5. Zachary Taylor\nWhile America was engaged in a fierce debate about extending slavery to Western territories, the robust twelfth president died suddenly on July 9, 1850. His passing was attributed to natural causes such as cholera or even a fatal case of gastroenteritis brought on by overindulging in cherries and milk. Some historians, however, believed the true cause to be arsenic poisoning perpetrated by his political enemies. In 1991, Taylor became the first president to have his remains exhumed, and tests conclusively showed that he was not assassinated by poison.\n6. Christopher Columbus\nDeath did little to slow the explorer’s global travels. Following his passing in 1506, Columbus was buried in Valladolid, Spain, and then moved to Seville. At his daughter-in-law’s request, Columbus was shipped across the Atlantic to Hispaniola in 1542 and interred in a Santo Domingo cathedral. When the French captured the island in 1795, the Spanish dug up remains thought to be those of the explorer and moved them to Cuba before returning them to Seville after the Spanish-American War in 1898. However, a box with human remains and the explorer’s name was discovered inside the Santo Domingo cathedral in 1877, and the mystery of whether remains of Columbus are in the New World, Old World or both continues.\n7. Oliver Cromwell\nWhen the English revolutionary who helped to overthrow the monarchy and sign the death warrant for King Charles I died in 1658, he was embalmed and buried with honor inside Westminster Abbey. Three years later, however, the monarchy returned and Cromwell was treated much differently. King Charles II exhumed Cromwell’s body on the twelfth anniversary of his father’s execution and in retribution for the regicide staged an execution of his own—albeit with Cromwell’s dead body. The Lord Protector’s corpse was strung up on display, beheaded and dumped into a vast London pit. Cromwell’s head was mounted on a pike on the roof of Westminster Hall, where it remained for decades as a warning to would-be revolutionaries. The head eventually became a collector piece and in 1960 was interred at Cromwell’s alma mater, Sidney Sussex College in Cambridge.\n8. Lee Harvey Oswald\nAmong the conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy was the assertion by author Michael Eddowes that the man arrested for the killing was actually a Soviet spy who had switched places with suspected assassin Lee Harvey Oswald during his visit to the Soviet Union months earlier. With the permission of Oswald’s widow, Eddowes had the body exhumed in 1981, and dental records confirmed the man was not a Russian body double, but Oswald himself.\n9. Simon Bolivar\nThe 19th-century South American revolutionary hero died near Santa Marta, Colombia in 1830 from what was believed to be tuberculosis. Twelve years after his death, Bolivar’s remains were exhumed from Santa Marta’s cathedral and transferred to Caracas, Venezuela. The late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, who was among the conspiracy theorists who believed Bolivar had been murdered by arsenic poisoning, had the man known as “El Libertador” exhumed in 2010 in an elaborate nationally televised broadcast, but the testing by forensic specialists proved inconclusive as to the cause of Bolivar’s death.\n10. Daniel Boone\nAfter the frontiersman’s 1820 death, Boone was buried in an unmarked grave near present-day Marthasville, Missouri. Twenty-five years later, the remains of Boone and his wife were disinterred and reburied in Frankfort, Kentucky. Some assert, however, that the wrong bodies were removed, and both Missouri and Kentucky still claim to be Boone’s final resting spot.\nTags\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nHelp with Find A Grave: Find all Perón ... Evita's body was spirited out of the country and buried secretly in Milan, Italy under the name Maria Maggi ... Robbers ... Eva \"Evita\" Perón (1919 - 1952) - Find A Grave Memorial Eva \"Evita\" Per�n (1919 - 1952) - Find A Grave Memorial\nBuenos Aires\nCapital Federal, Argentina\nArgentinean Leader. Wife of Argentina President Juan Domingo Peron. Born Maria Eva, she was the fourth child born to Juana Ibarguren and Juan Duarte, all illegitimate in a ramshackle house near the village of Los Toldos some 150 miles west of Buenos Aires.  At 15, she arrived in Buenos Aires, and became a star of radio soap operas and then a movie.  She met Juan Peron during an earthquake-relief meeting.  The widowed Peron married her in 1945, and they became a team in power ruling Argentina until her death from cancer in 1952. She lived in style and had a fierce mission: to be the savior of the poor.  She got the women the vote, won benefits for workers, founded schools, orphanages and hospitals.  She became an icon rivaling the Virgin Mary.  When she died of cancer, the 33-year old Evita was adored as a saint by working-class Argentines.  General Peron hired the best embalmer money could buy, the meticulous Dr. Pedro Ara of Spain, to preserve the body in lifelike perfection.  He tended to her for over 20 years and was accused of falling in love with the body.  The odyssey which was to last almost two decades began at her death with ceremonies upon ceremonies which only ceased when everyone was simply worn out.  Her body was then kept on the top floor of the Peronist trade union headquarters in Buenos Aires.  Visitation continued non-stop.  In 1955, a military coup overthrew Peron and he went into exile in Madrid, Spain.  Evita's body was spirited out of the country and buried secretly in Milan, Italy under the name Maria Maggi.  She lay here for 16 Years.  In 1971 her remains were dug up and hastily transferred to Spain and a villa where Juan Peron was staying.  Under the supervision of her embalmer, Dr. Pedro Ara, the rotted wood of the outer container was removed, showing the original bronze casket containing the perfectly preserved body of Evita.  1974 found Juan Peron President of Argentina once again.  He died July 1, 1974 and Eva was returned to Buenos Aires and her body for a brief time, was displayed next to his coffin.  Plans for a giant monument to them were abandoned due to renewed political unrest in the country.  Eventually, they were parted.  She was quickly and secretly in the middle of the night without ceremony was entombed to the Recoleta Cemetery, famous for its burial of the wealthy and socially prominent people of Argentina. Juan was interred on the grounds of the presidential estate.  Two years after Peron's death in 1974, a hostile military regime removed his coffin from the official grave on the presidential estate and banished it to the family crypt in a Buenos Aires cemetery.  Robbers broke into the crypt, in 1987 and sliced off the general's hands with an electric saw.  The mystery of the stolen hands remains \"one of the great enigmas of Argentine history\". (bio by: John R. Mark)\n\n"
