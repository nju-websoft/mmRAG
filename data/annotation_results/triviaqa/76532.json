                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not mention Stapleton International Airport directly.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Yes, it provides the correct state, Colorado, which is the answer to the query, assuming the reader makes a connection that both airports are in the same state.",

                "Explanation": "The document does not directly answer the query, as it lacks any mention of Stapleton International Airport. However, it can partially help infer the answer by providing the state (Colorado), which is correct for the query if one infers both airports are related. Therefore, the document is partially relevant."
