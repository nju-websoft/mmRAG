Hepburn’s first came for 1933’s Morning Glory, whose title derived from whether her actress character would have a long career or fade “like a morning glory.” And Hepburn’s award winning did fade: She went from a 26-year-old phenom getting a statuette for her third film to being labeled “box-office poison” in a 1938 exhibitors poll.\n[pullquote]\nDuring the decades before her next Oscar wins, she made critics swoon over such films as Bringing Up Baby and The Philadelphia Story and swept up a further eight noms. But it was 1967’s Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, 1968’s The Lion in Winter and 1981’s On Golden Pond that brought Oscars 2, 3 and 4. Hepburn made one appearance, at the 1974 awards presentation; she showed up wearing gardening togs, natch. She presented the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to producer and friend Lawrence Weingarten. “I’m living proof that a person can wait 41 years to be unselfish,” she said.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nKATHERINE HEPBURN: From \"Undercurrent ...

An                              athletic tomboy as a child, she was also very close to her brother, Tom, and was devastated at age 14 to find him dead, the apparent result of accidentally hanging himself while practicing a hanging trick their father                              had taught them. For many years after this, Katharine used his birthdate, November 8, as her own. She then became very shy around girls her age, and was largely schooled at home. She did attend Bryn Mawr College,                              however, and it was here that she decided to become an actress, appearing in many of their productions. After graduating, she began getting small roles in plays on Broadway and elsewhere. She always attracted attention                              in these parts, especially for her role in \"Art and Mrs. Bottle\" (1931); then, she finally broke into stardom when she took the starring role of the Amazon princess Antiope in \"A Warrior's Husband\" (1932). The inevitable film offers followed, and after making a few screen tests, she was cast in Bill of Divorcement, A (1932), opposite John Barrymore. The film was a hit, and after agreeing to her salary demands, RKO                              signed her to a contract. She made five films between 1932 and 1934. For her third, Morning Glory (1933) she won her first Academy Award. Her fourth, Little Women (1933) was the most successful picture of its day. But                              stories were beginning to leak out of her haughty behavior off-screen and her refusal to play the Hollywood Game, always wearing slacks and no makeup, never posing for pictures or giving interviews. Audiences were                              shocked at her unconventional behavior instead of applauding it, and so when she returned to Broadway in 1934 to star in \"The Lake, \" the critics panned her and the audiences, who at first bought up tickets,                              soon deserted her. When she returned to Hollywood, things didn't much better. From the period 1935-1938, she had only two hits: Alice Adams (1935), which brought her her second Oscar nomination, and Stage Door (1937);                              the many flops included Break of Hearts (1935), Sylvia Scarlett (1936), Mary of Scotland (1936), Quality Street (1937), and the now-classic Bringing Up Baby (1938). With so many flops, she came to be labeled \"box-office poison.\" She decided to go back to Broadway to star in \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1938), and was rewarded with a smash. She quickly bought the film rights, and so was able to negotiate her                              way back to Hollywood on her own terms, including her choice of director and costars. The film version of Philadelphia Story, The (1940), was a box-office hit, and Hepburn, who won her third Oscar nomination for the                              film, was bankable again. For her next film, Woman of the Year (1942), she was paired with Spencer Tracy, and the chemistry between them lasted for eight more films, spanning the course of 25 years, and a romance that                              lasted that long offscreen. (She received her fourth Oscar nomination for the film.) Their films included the very successful Adam's Rib (1949), Pat and Mike (1952), and Desk Set (1957). With African Queen, The (1951),                              Hepburn moved into middle-aged spinster roles, receiving her fifth Oscar nomination for the film. She played more of these types of roles throughout the 50's, and won more Oscar nominations for many of them, including                              her roles in Summertime (1955), Rainmaker, The (1956), and Suddenly, Last Summer (1959). Her film roles became fewer and farther between in the 60's, as she devoted her time to her ailing partner Spencer Tracy. For one                              of her film appearances in this decade, in Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962), she received her ninth Oscar nomination. After a five-year absence from films, she then made Guess Who's Coming To Dinner (1967), her last                              film with Tracy and the last film Tracy ever made; he died just weeks after finishing it. It garnered Hepburn her tenth Oscar nomination and her second win. The next year, she did Lion in Winter, The (1968), which                              brought her her eleventh Oscar nomination and third win. In the 70's, she turned to making made-for-TV films, with Glass Menagerie, The (1973) (TV), Love Among the Ruins (1975) (TV) and Corn Is Green, The (1979) (TV).                              She still continued to make an occasional appearence in feature films, such as Rooster Cogburn (1975), with John Wayne, and On Golden Pond (1981), with Henry Fonda. This last brought her her twelfth Oscar nomination and                              fourth win. She holds the record of being the actress with the most Oscar nominations and most Oscar wins. She made more TV-films in the 80's, and wrote her autobiography, _Me_, in 1991. Her most recent feature film was                              Love Affair (1994), with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, and her last TV-film to date was One Christmas (1994) (TV). She is still very much alive, now in her 90's and retired to Connecticut, truly a living legend.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMini biography\nKatharine Houghton Hepburn was born in Hartford, Connecticut on November 12, 1907 to a medical doctor and his                              wife. From an early age she was fascinated with the silent movies, often doing odd jobs to get the needed ticket money to go to her favorite theater and see the latest production. Katharine wanted to be an actress. She                              was educated at the Oxford School for Girls in Hartford and later attended Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia. She had been in local school plays but college would be something different. At first her grades did not lend                              themselves to the academic scenario, in fact she almost flunked out. Unless her grades improved Katharine could not participate in college plays. She then buckled down and achieved the grades she needed to attain her                              dream. Before long Kate, as she is fondly called, became an established member of Bryn Mawr's theater group. After leaving college, Kate began her acting career in earnest while touring with a stock company on the East                              Coast. It wasn't too long before the cinema beckoned. At first, Paramount offered her a contract but she turned them down flat. She felt that Hollywood was a ridiculous place for her to be. However, when RKO Pictures                              offered her a contract, Kate demanded $1,500 per week. RKO countered with a screen test in New York. RKO was planning the film A BILL OF DIVORCEMENT (1932) and felt Kate was the right part for Sydney Fairfield. She                              passed the screen test and the studio agreed to her salary \"demands\". Though she had never made a movie, director George Cukor felt she was right for the part. The film was a hit and it launched Kate into a                              career that would make her legendary. Kate's next film as Eva Lovelace in 1933's MORNING GLORY was, in short, a masterful performance. So masterful, in fact, that Kate won the first of four Academy Awards. Later that                              year Kate appeared in LITTLE WOMEN which was a box-office smash, breaking all records up to that time. In 1934, Kate appeared in SPITFIRE as Trigger Hicks, the illiterate tomboy who believes herself a faith healer.                              Afterward, she returned to her love as a stage actress. She didn't leave the silver screen patrons abandoned however. Kate filmed SYLVIA SCARLETT, BREAK OF HEARTS, and ALICE ADAMS in 1935 and A WOMAN REBEL followed by                              MARY OF SCOTLAND the next year. After the movie, BRINGING UP BABY in 1938, Kate hoped for the part of Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND but lost out to Vivien Leigh. She stayed in her beloved Connecticut for the                              summer of 1939, turning down roles for both the stage and screen. She finally accepted the stage role of Tracy lord in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY which later was parlayed into the screen version with a hit that broke all                              box-office records again. She was nominated for an Oscar for the role of Miss Lord, but lost to Joan Fontaine in SUSPICION. In 1942, Kate starred with the great Spencer Tracy in WOMAN OF THE YEAR. This would not be the                              last time they would team together. In KEEPER OF THE FLAME later that year she again appeared with Tracy. By 1947, Kate's popularity at the box-office slipped somewhat and made fewer films as a result. She did star in                              the hit ADAM'S RIB in 1949 with Tracy. The films she chose to make were grand one's indeed. 1951 saw her star with Humphrey Bogart in THE AFRICAN QUEEN. Kate was to make six more films during the balance of the 1950's                              with SUDDENLY, LAST SUMMER in 1959 with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. Kate was to make no films again until 1962's LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT. Five years later she teamed up again with Spencer Tracy in GUESS                              WHO'S COMING TO DINNER with Syndney Poitier. This film garnered her second Academy Award. The following year she won her third Oscar for THE LION IN WINTER which saw her tied with Barbra Streisand who played in FUNNY                              GIRL. A few movies and made for TV films followed in the 1970's. In 1981, Kate starred as Ethel Thayer with Henry Fonda in the hit ON GOLDEN POND which gave her a fourth Oscar. Several made for TV special followed with                              her last big screen appearance in LOVE AFFAIR in 1994. The longevity of this fine actress will be very hard to match. Currently Kate is retired to her home in Connecticut.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'Ludlow Ogden Smith' (1928 - 1934) (divorced)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTrivia\nGraduated from Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, PA in 1928, with a BA in Drama\nSeptember 1999 - Katherine was named Best Classic Actress of the 20th Century in an Entertainment Weekly on-line poll, just barely                              (21.5% to 20.6%) beating out runner-up Audrey Hepburn.\nHas never watched Guess Who's Coming to Dinner because it was Spencer Tracy's last film\n(June 1999) Ranked #1 woman in the AFI's '50 greatest movie legends'.\nWalked around the studio in her underwear in the early 1930's when the costume department stole her slacks from her dressing room.

(b. May 12, 1907, Hartford, Conn.) She was branded \"box-office poison\" by the nation's exhibitors in 1938, but Katharine Hepburn has come to                              be regarded as a national treasure. One of the most frequently honored screen actresses (with eight Academy nominations and four Oscars to her credit), Hepburn came to films inA Bill of Divorcement (1932), as John                              Barrymore's daughter, following a sometimes tempestuous career on stage in amateur theatricals, college shows, stock, and finally on Broadway. Her unusual looks and manner-and her unique New England voice-put off some                              moviegoers at first, but her endearing performance as a naive, impulsive young actress trying to crash Broadway, in 1933'sMorning Glory won her her first Academy Award. Hepburn proved her versatility in such pictures                              asLittle Women (1933),The Little Minister (1934),Alice Adams (1935, for which she received an Oscar nomination),Mary of Scotland (1936), and the wonderfulStage Door (1937, an interesting companion piece toMorning Glory                              But for every success in her early Hollywood career, there was also a major misfireincluding such all-time oddities asChristopher Strong (1933, in which she played an aviatrix) andSylvia Scarlett (1935, in which she                              disguised herself as a boy).\nBy the time she made the classic screwball comedyBringing Up Baby (1938, for which the understandably nervous actress took comedy \"pointers\" from veteran screen funnyman                              Walter Catlett) and the equally delightful comedy-dramaHoliday (also 1938), Hepburn's film career was on the skids. (Although it was that same year that Walt Disney immortalized her in cartoon form, as a haughty Little                              Bo-Peep in his animated short subjectMother Goose Goes Hollywood She returned to Broadway to star as spoiled socialite Tracy Lord in Philip Barry's \"The Philadelphia Story,\" forsaking a huge salary for a                              percentage of profits and title to the screen rights. Her successful gamble paid off, and led to an equally triumphant return to Hollywood in the 1940 film version, which earned her another Oscar nomina tion. She was                              nominated again for her next film,Woman of the Year (1942) which cast her as an opinionated newspaper columnist opposite Spencer Tracy (as a down-to-earth sportswriter). It was a match made in movie heaven; the two                              would star in eight subsequent films over the next 25 years. (They also commenced an offscreen relationship that lasted until his death.)\nSome of the early Tracy-Hepburn collaborations were heavy dramas such                              asKeeper of the Flame (1942) andThe Sea of Grass (1947). Dramatic fireworks flew as well inState of the Union (1948), but the team is best remembered for its humorous skirmishes in the battle of the sexes withWithout                              Love (1945),Adam's Rib (1949),Pat and Mike (1952), andDesk Set (1957). While Hepburn's work in the 1930s and 1940s receives the most attention today, many of the star's peak achievements were realized in the 1950s and                              1960s. She picked up Oscar nominations for her work inThe African Queen (1951, opposite Humphrey Bogart, as a missionary whose personality she patterned after Eleanor Roosevelt),Summertime (1955),The Rainmaker (1956),Suddenly, Last Summer (1959, as Elizabeth Taylor's shrewish, sinister aunt), andLong Day's Journey Into Night (1962). Offscreen for five years, she returned to costar with Tracy inGuess Who's Coming to Dinner                              (1967), which proved to be his final film; it won her a second Oscar. Hepburn received her third gold statuette the following year for her work in the period dramaThe Lion in Winter as Eleanor of Aquitaine, which showed                              the aging actress in full command of her inestimable talent. She followed this triumph by making her Broadway musical debut as couturier Coco Chanel in \"Coco.\" Other films around this time include The Madwoman                              of Chaillot (1969), The Trojan Women (1972), and A Delicate Balance (1973).\nA much-anticipated pairing of Hepburn with John Wayne yielded disappointing results, asRooster Cogburn (1975) turned out to be a                              watered-down retread ofThe African Queen But her teaming with another screen giant, Henry Fonda, inOn Golden Pond (1981), brought her a fourth Best Actress Academy Award, and proved to be her finest latter-day film.                              Hepburn's TV work has largely been confined to long-form dramas. She received Emmy nominations for Tennessee Williams' \"The Glass Menagerie\" (1973), and \"The Corn Is Green\" (1979), directed by her                              longtime friend and collaborator, George Cukor. She won an Emmy for \"Love Among the Ruins\" (1975), also directed by Cukor and costarring Laurence Olivier. Since that time she has starred in several \"star-vehicle\" TV movies, includingLaura Lansing Slept Here (1988), The Man Upstairs (1992), and This Can't Be Love (1994). Her 1991 autobiography, \"Me,\" was a best-seller, as was her more specific                              1987 memoir, \"The Making of The African Queen or How I Went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind.\" After years away from the big screen, Hepburn was coaxed back to do Love Affair                              (1994); she provided that film's highlight, as Warren Beatty's aunt.\n \nThese Items are FOR SALE to knowledgeable Collectors.

But which one deserves the title of our greatest actress?\nKATHARINE HEPBURN\nby Hannah Betts\nAnyone who imagines that Katharine Hepburn could ever be eclipsed is – to use Hepburn-esque language – a fool. She was simply awesome, as the thousands currently flocking to the BFI Southbank’s Hepburn season would passionately endorse.\nHepburn may have won four Oscars over her 60-year career, but attended the ceremony only once, to present a gong to someone else – a typically Hepburnian gesture. In 1999, she was named the greatest star in Hollywood history by the American Film Institute, and so she remains. Meryls may come and go, but Kate towers immortal.\nRelated Articles\nMiriam Margolyes: 'Look, nobody likes Jews...'\n21 Feb 2015\nA class act as an actor and a human being, Hepburn was a born grafter. When her career took a nose in the late Thirties, she engineered her own triumphant return in The Philadelphia Story (1940), designed to reveal the tender side of her patrician persona.\nHer on-screen wrangling with her partner of 26 years, Spencer Tracy, introduced a new kind of woman into the world: the “modern woman”, no less – spirited, assertive, proto-feminist. At an age when her peers were going into retirement, she took on epic professional challenges: Shakespeare seasons, performing her own stunts, and the near-death experience that was The African Queen (1951).\nAs an individual, she was no less bold. The public was forced to learn to love her for her bluntness, standoffishness, and boyish style, and love her they did. Hepburn was the woman who wore the trousers, literally and metaphorically. Even if Streep does win her fourth Oscar, she will not – and could never – come near. HB\nFirst screen role\nThe melodrama A Bill of Divorcement (1932).\nBreakthrough film\nSee above. Variety declared: “She has a vital something that sets her apart from the picture galaxy.” Her performance secured her instant stardom and a contract with RKO.\nFirst Oscar nod\nMorning Glory (1934), the story of a naive young actress’s journey to stardom.\nGreatest Oscar moment\nDidn’t pick up her own gongs, only attending in 1974 to present an award to MGM producer Lawrence Weingarten. Flew in the face of convention by winning three of her four Oscars in her sixties and seventies.\nShould have won for\nBringing Up Baby (1938), The Philadelphia Story (1940) and The African Queen (1951), according to BFI curator Hannah McGill. Hepburn herself would have said she deserved a gong for Sidney Lumet’s version of O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey Into Night (1962). Little girls of all ages would cry: “Jo March in Little Women (1933)”.\nMost iconic role\nThe Philadelphia Story, the vehicle she devised to win back America’s heart, in which haughty heiress Tracy Lord auditions a pack of admirers while revealing her softer side.\nBest on-screen chemistry\nSparring with real-life love Spencer Tracy, with whom she made nine films, including Woman of the Year (1942) and Adam’s Rib (1949).\nGreatest scene\nHer Oscar-winning performance as Eleanor of Aquitaine in The Lion in Winter (1968) – an icon embodied by an icon.\nGreatest look\nLooking divine in a virginal white robe as Cary Grant deems her a chill goddess in The Philadelphia Story. That said, as McGill notes: “Her best look was off-screen – slacks, mannish shoes and a big smile – and always utterly elegant nonetheless.”\nUnlikeliest moment\nThe closing scene of Woman of the Year (1942), rewritten to her immense disapproval to make her character seem submissive to her husband. Closely followed by turns as an uneducated mountain girl, Chinese peasant, comedic Soviet pilot, and the lead in a musical life of Coco Chanel.\nGreatest off-screen line\nOn being introduced to Jane Fonda on the set of On Golden Pond (1981), Hepburn declared: “I don’t like you.” Fonda recalled: “It was a terrible moment… someone only a notch below God was damning me.”\nMost feminist moment\nNot only did she regularly kick male co-star ass, she played a female aviator, a suffragist (like her mother), dressed in boy-drag and kissed a woman. When a studio had her slacks confiscated in an effort to persuade her into a skirt, she stalked the set in her underwear until they were returned.\nHarshest critic\nDorothy Parker on Hepburn’s Broadway appearance in The Lake in 1934: “Katharine Hepburn runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.” When Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett O’Hara, producer David O Selznick remarked: “I can’t see Rhett Butler chasing you for 12 years.”\nMERYL STREEP by Tim Robey\nMeryl Streep in Silkwood\n“‘Meryl Streep was nominated for a Golden Globe’ is a fancy way of saying ‘It’s December’,” quipped some wag on Twitter when her first awards attention for Into the Woods was noted.\nAfter 19 Oscar nominations, it’s easy to take Streep for granted: we all know the woman can act. Her genius for it is some kind of given, so much so that she faces an uphill struggle to prove each performance worthy of the latest laurel, rather than merely being an additional instalment of Streep-adulation in generalised form.\nAround her nominations for Doubt (in 2008) and Julie & Julia (2009), the talk was all of whether and when Streep would take a third Oscar, adding to her existing trophies for Kramer vs Kramer (1979) and Sophie’s Choice (1982). She deserved a third, many agreed, but maybe not for those. Maybe not even for The Iron Lady (2011), though she got it.\nThese are the standards Streep has set herself, by being one of the few film stars of modern times – Daniel Day-Lewis, Julianne Moore and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman are others – whose stardom feels built on a what-next quality in their acting, a serial flaunting of their formidable technique. Like the shark that has to swim constantly, Streep must keep transforming and outdoing herself, or her star may risk slipping in the firmament.\nIn the UK, we have our dames, Helen Mirren and Judi Dench. Streep is Hollywood’s dame – legendary as the only woman over 60 with the box-office draw to commandeer vehicles and ring the tills. Something like a Devil Wears Prada can be built around her, but only on the condition it lets her strut her stuff, whip up something next-level, add a vital new portrait to the gallery.\nSome complain of Streep “doing a Streep”, as if it only required a switch to be flipped. But there’s both wild largesse and minute calibration to her best acting. She can be subtle and monumental, powerhouse and pointillist, all at once. TR\nFirst screen role\nStreep appeared in a terrible wig and way down the bill of Julia (1977), a biopic about Hollywood radical Lillian Hellman, played by Jane Fonda. Most of Streep’s scenes were left on the cutting-room floor.\nBreakthrough film\nShe played opposite Robert De Niro in the harrowing Vietnam epic, The Deer Hunter (1979).\nFirst Oscar nod\nShe received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for The Deer Hunter, but lost out to Maggie Smith (in California Suite). She triumphed the following year, winning Best Supporting Actress for Kramer vs Kramer.\nGreatest Oscar moment\nIn recent years, Streep – for four decades a hallowed presence at the Academy Awards – has been thanked in other people’s acceptance speeches more times than God. She namechecked the Lord herself when she won Best Actress for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, saying: “I want to thank God – Harvey Weinstein.”\nShould have won for\nWell, take your pick - she’s been nominated a record 19 times: Silkwood (1983), Out of Africa (1985), Bridges of Madison County (1995). However, she was inexplicably overlooked for The Hours (2003), playing a modern-day Mrs Dalloway opposite Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman, who won for her Virginia Woolf.\nMost iconic role\nShe wowed baby boomers with Sophie’s Choice (1982), about the trauma of Holocaust survival. Generation Y-ers, however, think fondly of her goofy performance in Death Becomes Her (1992), a black comedy about eternal life in which Streep ends up wearing her head back to front.\nBest on-screen chemistry\nSupremely comfortable in mid-life romantic comedies, she and Tommy Lee Jones sizzled (eventually) in Hope Springs (2012), about a long-married couple who seek marriage guidance to learn how to be intimate with each other again. There were sparks between her and Alec Baldwin in It’s Complicated (2009).\nGreatest scene\nFor all her serious roles, Streep was never more devastating than in the “blue sweater” scene in The Devil Wears Prada, when, as the demanding editor-in-chief of a high-fashion magazine, she delivers a deadly monologue about why the fashion industry is a serious business (“What you don’t know is that that sweater is not just blue, it’s not turquoise, it’s not lapis, it’s actually cerulean…”).\nGreatest look\nThe midnight grey cloak she wore to standson the Cobb in Lyme Regis, looking out to see, in The French Lieutenant’s Woman (1981). That, or her Prada power-dressing in Devil Wears...\nUnlikeliest moment\nHer cliff-edge rendition of The Winner Takes It All in Mamma Mia: The Movie (2008) is unexpectedly affecting; she recorded her vocal in one take, too. Take that, Agnetha.\nGreatest off-screen line\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\n...

She  attended Bryn Mawr College and graduated in 1928, where she discovered she  wanted to be an actress. Hepburn went on to become one of a well-known actress.  She won four Academy Awards, and is also an Emmy Award winner and Tony Award  nominee. She shared the screen with Spencer Tracy in many films and the two  were also close off screen, but never married. She also wrote two memoirs when  she was in her 80s. On June 29, 2003, Katharine Hepburn died of natural causes  in her home in Old Saybrook, Connecticut.\nBiography:\nBorn on May 12, 1907, in Hartford, Connecticut,  Katharine Houghton Hepburn was welcomed by her loving parents Katherine and  Thomas Hepburn. Growing up Katherine was one of five siblings: Tom, Dick, Bob,  Marion, and Peg. As a child, she was close to her brother Tom, and was seen as  an athletic tomboy. In 1921, when Hepburn was only 14-years-old, she found her  brother Tom hanged in what is thought to be an accident. He had been practicing  a hanging trick that their father had taught them. This was extremely traumatic  experience for Hepburn that disturbed her for years. The years following the  accident she was reserved with girls her own age and had to receive home  schooling. She even celebrated Tom’s birthday, November 8, as her own.\nHepburn went on to attend Bryn Mawr College, where  she majored in history and philosophy. While attending Bryn Mawr, she decided  she wanted to become an actress. While enrolled there she took part in many of  their productions. Her most notable performance was as Pandora in John Lyly’s The  Woman in the Moone. Also while there she met future husband, Ludlow Ogden  Smith. The pair married in 1928, but eventually divorced in 1934.\nAfter graduating from Bryn Mawr, she moved to New  York and began her quest to become an actress. She landed a few small roles on  Broadway before landing her first big debut in 1932, when she appeared in A  Warrior’s Husband. This launched her into screen tests, which landed her a  role in A Bill of Divorcement that same year opposite John Barrymore . She  portrays an insane man’s daughter, and after he escapes the institution, she is  left to take care of him. Hepburn received excellent reviews and went on to  make more films from 1932 to 1934. The third film was Morning Glory in  1933, which earned her an Academy Award. Hepburn plays a small town actress who  moves to New York dreaming of stardom. Little Women was her next movie;  it was one of the most successful films during its time. Hepburn plays  Josephine March, and won Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival. In the  1930s, Hepburn also was romantically involved with Howard Hughes, a very  wealthy businessman. At age 19, he inherited the Hughes Tool Company. He went on  to become a Hollywood movie producer for RKO Pictures, where he met Hepburn.  Hughes was a very busy man; he not only was a movie producer, but also was  known as an aircraft inventor and a mining mogul. Hepburn and Hughes never  married; the 2004 movie Aviator was based on their relationship.\nAlong with Hepburn’s success, came arrogance. Word  began to spread that Hepburn was difficult backstage. She did not wear makeup,  often wore slacks, and never posed for pictures. She then returned to Broadway,  where she starred in The Lake, which Hepburn got horrible reviews. After  she returned to Hollywood, she only had two hits in the next few years. In  1935, she starred in Alice Adams, earning her second Oscar nomination.  In the film, Hepburn plays Alice Adams, the daughter of a modest family and  dreams of being accepted by higher society. However, after Alice Adams,  Hepburn had a string of flops and was labeled as “box office poison,” because  of her movie failures.\nHepburn then went back to Broadway where she starred  in The Philadelphia Story, which was a major success. Hepburn enjoyed  the play so much, that she bought the film rights and returned to Hollywood to  make her own movie with her choice of director and co-stars. The big screen  version of The Philadelphia Story was a smash, and Hepburn was back in  the business with her third Oscar nomination. The film depicts Hepburn as Tracy  Lord, a wealthy socialite from the Main Line in Philadelphia. She divorces  husband C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) and plans to marry newly rich George  Kittredge until all the wedding plans go crazy; Jimmy Stewart won  the Oscar for his role as a wealthy journalist reporting on the wedding  details.\nIn 1942, she starred in Woman of the Year with  Spencer Tracy in which the two play a couple who try to keep the romance alive  in their marriage. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said, “The  acting of Miss Hepburn and Mr. Tracy are all as crisp and cracking as a brand  new $1,000 bill.” It earned Hepburn an Oscar nomination, but she did not win  that year. The two became box office gold and went on to star in eight more  movies together. The romance between them lasted for the next 25 years both on  and off screen; however, the two never married because Spencer was married to  Louise Treadwell. Since Tracy was Catholic, he never divorced his wife,  Treadwell. As a result, Hepburn and Tracy hid their relationship from the  public. The most notable films that Tracy and Hepburn starred in together were Adam’s  Rib in 1949, Pat and Mike in 1952, and Desk Set in 1957.\nIn 1951, Hepburn starred in one of her most  recognized films, The African Queen, starring opposite Humphrey Bogart.  In The African Queen,Hepburn plays a spinster missionary in  colonial Africa during World War I. She is forced to flee her mission after  Germany wipes out the village she is working in. Bogart’s character is a  Canadian supplier and he offers to take her down the river to civilization on a  little steamer called The African Queen. The two have contrasting personalities  and Hepburn wants to continue down the river and attack the German cruiser. The  movie earned fantastic reviews and both actors were acknowledged for their  roles. This marked the move from younger characters to middle-aged roles, and  Hepburn earned her fifth Oscar nomination, but she lost to Vivien Leigh. In the  1950s, Hepburn earned six more Academy Award nominations and was busy in the  movie business.\nIn the 1960’s, she withdrew from the movie business  and began to spend more time with Tracy. In 1967, the pair starred in Guess  Who’s Coming To Dinner. Tracy and Hepburn played uptight upper class  parents whose daughter comes home married to an African American man. It was  the duo’s last film together, and Spencer Tracy’s last film ever; he died a few  weeks after the movie was finished. However, Hepburn did earn her second Oscar,  for Best Actress, for the film. The following year, Hepburn starred in The Lion In Winter, in which she won her third Academy Award. A review by the  American Film Institute (AFI) said, “The performances by Peter O’Toole and  Katharine Hepburn are the best of their careers.” Hepburn played Eleanor of  Aquitaine and O’Toole played King Henry II. The movie is about their rocky  marriage and three sons, and who is left to become the next King. O’Toole was  also nominated for an Academy Award and the movie was nominated for Best  Picture in 1968.\nOn Broadway, Hepburn performed in many Shakespearean  roles and even performed as Coco Chanel in the musical Coco in 1969.  Hepburn was nervous about her singing voice, but this did not seem to be a  problem, since the enjoyed a long run on Broadway. Hepburn was nominated for a  Tony Award in 1970 for Best Actress in a Musical.\nIn the 1970’s, Hepburn turned away from the big  screen and Broadway. She began to make many made-for-TV films. Her most popular  one was, Love Among the Ruins in which she co-starred with Laurence  Oliver in 1975. Hepburn portrays an aging dame of the London Theater, Jessica  Medlicott. Medlicott is accused of seducing a young man and she hires the  greatest lawyer in Britain who has been in love with her for years. The TV  movie earned Hepburn an Emmy Award.\nIn 1971, Katherine Hepburn received the high honor of  being awarded the Screen Actor’s Guild Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1981,  Hepburn was cast in the movie On Golden Pond, opposite Henry Fonda. They  play an old couple who summer on a lake and get a visit from their estranged  daughter and her stepson. Hepburn earned her fourth Academy Award for her work  in this film. Hepburn’s record four Academy Awards and 12 nominations is a  record that is only broken by Meryl Streep with 13 nominations. No other actor has  ever earned as many Oscars as Hepburn did. It is not question that Hepburn was  a talented actress, she was once quoted saying, “I’m a personality as well as  an actress, Show me an actress who isn’t a personality and you’ll show me a  woman who isn’t a star.”\nHepburn did not stop there. In 1988 she wrote, The  Making of the African Queen, which discussed the antics that went on during  the making of the film, The African Queen. In 1991 she became a  bestselling author with her memoir titled, Me: Stories of My Life. It  was in this memoir that she released her birthday was May 12, not November 8,  which was her brother Tom’s. Also in 1991, the AFI named Hepburn as the number  one woman in film over the last 50 years. Her last film was a brief appearance  in Love Affair in 1994, which was a remake of An Affair to Remember.\nHepburn retired from the movie industry because of  her declining health and after that remained mostly as home. She kept active by  biking and swimming near her ocean house in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. At the  age of 96, surrounded by her family and loved ones she passed away on June 29,  2003. Although she is gone, Hepburn’s legacy still lives on. She will even be  remembered by some as the First Lady of Cinema.\nOn September 8, 2006, Hepburn’s alma mater, Bryn Mawr  College, opened the Katharine Houghton Hepburn Center in honor of Hepburn and  her mother. The main focus of the center is to help women lead appealing lives  and to get involved with important issues affecting women today. In the summer  of 2008 in Hepburn’s hometown of Old Saybrook, Connecticut, the Katharine  Hepburn Cultural Arts Center and Theatre opened, their mission is to promote  cultural arts for current and future generation for the people of the area.  Hepburn also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; it is located at 6284  Hollywood Boulevard in between Argyle Avenue and Vine Street.\nWorks:\nMemoirs\nThe       Making of the “African Queen”, Or How I Went To Africa with Bogart, Bacall       and Almost Lost My Life.\nMe: Stories of My Life.

An athletic tomboy as a child, she was also very close to her brother, Tom, and was devastated at age 14 to find him dead, the apparent result of accidentally hanging himself while practicing a hanging trick their father had taught them. For many years after this, Katharine used his birthdate, November 8, as her own. She then became very shy around girls her age, and was largely schooled at home. She did attend Bryn Mawr College, however, and it was here that she decided to become an actress, appearing in many of their productions.\nAfter graduating, she began getting small roles in plays on Broadway and elsewhere. She always attracted attention in these parts, especially for her role in \"Art and Mrs. Bottle\" (1931); then, she finally broke into stardom when she took the starring role of the Amazon princess Antiope in \"A Warrior's Husband\" (1932). The inevitable film offers followed, and after making a few screen tests, she was cast in A Bill of Divorcement (1932), opposite John Barrymore . The film was a hit, and after agreeing to her salary demands, RKO signed her to a contract. She made five films between 1932 and 1934. For her third, Morning Glory (1933) she won her first Academy Award. Her fourth, Little Women (1933) was the most successful picture of its day.\nBut stories were beginning to leak out of her haughty behavior off- screen and her refusal to play the Hollywood Game, always wearing slacks and no makeup, never posing for pictures or giving interviews. Audiences were shocked at her unconventional behavior instead of applauding it, and so when she returned to Broadway in 1934 to star in \"The Lake\", the critics panned her and the audiences, who at first bought up tickets, soon deserted her. When she returned to Hollywood, things didn't get much better. From the period 1935-1938, she had only two hits: Alice Adams (1935), which brought her her second Oscar nomination, and Stage Door (1937); the many flops included Break of Hearts (1935), Sylvia Scarlett (1935), Mary of Scotland (1936), Quality Street (1937) and the now- classic Bringing Up Baby (1938).\nWith so many flops, she came to be labeled \"box-office poison.\" She decided to go back to Broadway to star in \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1938), and was rewarded with a smash. She quickly bought the film rights, and so was able to negotiate her way back to Hollywood on her own terms, including her choice of director and co-stars. The film version of The Philadelphia Story (1940), was a box-office hit, and Hepburn, who won her third Oscar nomination for the film, was bankable again. For her next film, Woman of the Year (1942), she was paired with Spencer Tracy , and the chemistry between them lasted for eight more films, spanning the course of 25 years, and a romance that lasted that long off-screen. (She received her fourth Oscar nomination for the film.) Their films included the very successful Adam's Rib (1949), Pat and Mike (1952), and Desk Set (1957).\nWith The African Queen (1951), Hepburn moved into middle-aged spinster roles, receiving her fifth Oscar nomination for the film. She played more of these types of roles throughout the 50s, and won more Oscar nominations for many of them, including her roles in Summertime (1955), The Rainmaker (1956) and Suddenly, Last Summer (1959). Her film roles became fewer and farther between in the 60s, as she devoted her time to her ailing partner Spencer Tracy. For one of her film appearances in this decade, in Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962), she received her ninth Oscar nomination. After a five-year absence from films, she then made Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), her last film with Tracy and the last film Tracy ever made; he died just weeks after finishing it. It garnered Hepburn her tenth Oscar nomination and her second win. The next year, she did The Lion in Winter (1968), which brought her her eleventh Oscar nomination and third win.\nIn the 70s, she turned to making made-for-TV films, with The Glass Menagerie (1973), Love Among the Ruins (1975) and The Corn Is Green (1979). She still continued to make an occasional appearance in feature films, such as Rooster Cogburn (1975), with John Wayne , and On Golden Pond (1981), with Henry Fonda . This last brought her her twelfth Oscar nomination and fourth win - the latter currently still a record for an actress.\nShe made more TV-films in the 80s, and wrote her autobiography, 'Me', in 1991. Her last feature film was Love Affair (1994), with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening , and her last TV- film was One Christmas (1994). With her health declining she retired from public life in the mid-nineties. She died at the age of 96 at her home in Old Saybrook, Connecticut.\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: Tommy Peter\nSpouse (1)\nTrade Mark (6)\nPlaying strong independent women with minds of their own\nOften wore slacks instead of dresses, decades before it became fashionable for  women to do so\nDistinctive way of speaking, with what many say is a \"Bryn Mawr\" accent\nFrequently worked with Cary Grant , 'Spencer Tracy', and George Cukor\nHer recognizable angular features\nHer strong outspoken personality\nTrivia (105)\nGraduated from Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 1928, with a degree in history and philosophy.\nWas named Best Classic Actress of the 20th Century in an Entertainment Weekly on-line poll, just barely (21.5% to 20.6%) beating out runner-up Audrey Hepburn .

When the Conference of Studio Unions, headed by suspected Communist Party member Herb Sorrell, launched a strike in 1946-1947 against the studios and fought other unions for control over Hollywood's collective bargaining, she expressed support for him (Sorrell was kidnapped, beaten, and left for dead, during the strike, possibly by the Mafia, which up until the early 1940s, had controlled the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which was contesting the CSU for jurisdiction over Hollywood unions.) At a Screen Writers Guild meeting during the CSU strike, She also made a speech which anti-communist, anti-CSU SAG activist Ronald Reagan recognized as being based word for word on a CSU strike bulletin. She ignored lover Spencer Tracy 's admonition that actors should stay out of politics (\"Remember who shot Lincoln\"). Despite their family's wealth, her mother had been sympathetic to Marxism and the Soviet Union. On May 19, 1947, Hepburn addressed a Progressive Party rally at the Hollywood Legion Stadium with Progressive Party stalwart and later presidential candidate Henry Wallace (with a crowd that included the likes of Judy Garland , Edward G. Robinson , Lena Horne , Charles Chaplin , Gene Kelly , Frank Sinatra , Ava Gardner and Danny Kaye ), the former vice president of the U.S. who had been sacked from President Harry S. Truman 's cabinet for being pro-Soviet. Wearing a red dress, Hepburn delivered a speech, written by Communist Party member and soon-to-be indicted Hollywood Ten member Dalton Trumbo . When another Hollywood Ten screenwriter Ring Lardner Jr. , (winner of an Oscar for writing her picture Woman of the Year (1942), was jailed, she wrote a letter of support for him.

Hepburn herself was surpassed by Meryl Streep , with 17 nods (14 in the Best Actress category, 3 in the Best Supporting Actress category) and three wins (two in the Best Actress category and one Best supporting actress award).

Hepburn won her second Oscar for this film, ... Katharine Hepburn | Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos ... Katharine Hepburn | Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos | AllMovie\ntwitter\nBiography                             by Hal Erickson\n\"I'm a personality as well as an actress,\" Katharine Hepburn once declared. \"Show me an actress who isn't a personality, and you'll show me a woman who isn't a star.\" Hepburn 's bold, distinctive personality was apparent almost from birth. She inherited from her doctor father and suffragette mother her three most pronounced traits: an open and ever-expanding mind, a healthy body (maintained through constant rigorous exercise), and an inability to tell anything less than the truth.\nHepburn was more a personality than an actress when she took the professional plunge after graduating from Bryn Mawr in 1928; her first stage parts were bits, but she always attracted attention with her distinct New England accent and her bony, sturdy frame. The actress' outspokenness lost her more jobs than she received, but, in 1932, she finally scored on Broadway with the starring role in The Warrior's Husband. She didn't want to sign the film contract offered her by RKO, so she made several \"impossible\" demands concerning salary and choice of scripts. The studios agreed to her terms, and, in 1932, she made her film debut opposite John Barrymore in A Bill of Divorcement (despite legends to the contrary, the stars got along quite well). Critical reaction to Hepburn 's first film set the tone for the next decade: Some thought that she was the freshest and most original actress in Hollywood, while others were irritated by her mannerisms and \"artificial\" speech patterns. For her third film, Morning Glory (1933), Hepburn won the first of her four Oscars. But despite initial good response to her films, Hepburn lost a lot of popularity during her RKO stay because of her refusal to play the \"Hollywood game.\" She dressed in unfashionable slacks and paraded about without makeup; refused to pose for pinup pictures, give autographs, or grant interviews; and avoided mingling with her co-workers. As stories of her arrogance and self-absorption leaked out, moviegoers responded by staying away from her films. The fact that Hepburn was a thoroughly dedicated professional -- letter-perfect in lines, completely prepared and researched in her roles, the first to arrive to the set each day and the last to leave each evening -- didn't matter in those days, when style superseded substance.\nBriefly returning to Broadway in 1933's The Lake, Hepburn received devastating reviews from the same critics who found her personality so bracing in The Warrior's Husband . The grosses on her RKO films diminished with each release -- understandably so, since many of them ( Break of Hearts [1935], Mary of Scotland [1936]) were not very good. She reclaimed the support of RKO executives after appearing in the moneymaking Alice Adams (1935) -- only to lose it again by insisting upon starring in Sylvia Scarlett (1936), a curious exercise in sexual ambiguity that lost a fortune. Efforts to \"humanize\" the haughty Hepburn personality in Stage Door (1937) and the delightful Bringing Up Baby (1938) came too late; in 1938, she was deemed \"box-office poison\" by an influential exhibitor's publication. Hepburn 's career might have ended then and there, but she hadn't been raised to be a quitter. She went back to Broadway in 1938 with a part written especially for her in Philip Barry 's The Philadelphia Story. Certain of a hit, she bought the film rights to the play; thus, when it ended up a success, she was able to negotiate her way back into Hollywood on her own terms, including her choice of director and co-stars. Produced by MGM in 1940, the film version was a box-office triumph, and Hepburn had beaten the \"poison\" label.\nIn her next MGM film, Woman of the Year (1942), Hepburn co-starred with Spencer Tracy , a copacetic teaming that endured both professionally and personally until Tracy 's death in 1967. After several years of off-and-on films, Hepburn scored another success with 1951's The African Queen , marking her switch from youngish sophisticates to middle-aged character leads. After 1962's Long Day's Journey into Night , Hepburn withdrew from performing for nearly five years, devoting her attention to her ailing friend and lover Tracy . She made the last of her eight screen appearances with Tracy in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), which also featured her niece Katharine Houghton . Hepburn won her second Oscar for this film, and her third the following year for A Lion in Winter ; the fourth was bestowed 13 years later for On Golden Pond (1981). When she came back to Broadway for the 1969 musical Coco, Hepburn proved that the years had not mellowed her; she readily agreed to preface her first speech with a then-shocking profanity, and, during one performance, she abruptly dropped character to chew out an audience member for taking flash pictures. Hepburn made the first of her several television movies in 1975, co-starring with Sir Laurence Olivier in Love Among the Ruins -- and winning an Emmy award, as well. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1976's A Matter of Gravity.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Hepburn continued to star on TV and in films, announcing on each occasion that it would be her last performance. She also began writing books and magazine articles, each of them an extension of her personality: self-centered, well-organized, succinct, and brutally frank (especially regarding herself). While she remained a staunch advocate of physical fitness, Hepburn suffered from a genetic condition, a persistent tremor that caused her head to shake -- an affliction she blithely incorporated into her screen characters. In 1994, Warren Beatty coaxed Hepburn out of her latest retirement to appear as his aristocratic grand-aunt in Love Affair . Though appearing frailer than usual, Katharine Hepburn was in complete control of herself and her craft, totally dominating her brief scenes. And into her nineties and on the threshold of her tenth decade, Katharine Hepburn remained the consummate personality, actress, and star.\nOn June 29, 2003 Katharine Hepburn died of natural causes in Old Saybrook, Connetticut. She was 96.\nMovie Highlights\nSee Full Filmography\nFactsheet\nTaking a cue from her activist parents, who were a strong and persistent influence, she supported women's voting and reproductive rights.\nStarred in nine films with longtime companion Spencer Tracy.\nOut of respect for his family, chose not to attend Tracy's funeral in 1967, opting instead to assist in lifting his casket into the hearse at the funeral home; refrained from speaking of their personal relationship until after the death of his wife in 1983.\nComposer Stephen Sondheim was a neighbor in the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan where she owned a brownstone for over 50 years.  \nPublished her first book, The Making of The African Queen, in 1987; a few years later, she reportedly received $4.5 million for her biography Me: Stories of My Life.\nCouncil of Fashion Designers gave her a lifetime achievement award in 1986, due in large part to her ground-breaking preference for trousers early in her career.\nWith 12 nominations and four wins, held the record for most Academy Award nominations for acting until Meryl Streep surpassed her in 2003.\nSpent the last years of her life at the family home in the Fenwick section of Old Saybrook, CT, that served as a retreat throughout her life.\nHad a cultural-arts center, which also includes a museum dedicated to her life, named after her in Old Saybrook in 2009. \nWas honored with a commemorative stamp by the U.S. Postal Service in 2010.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 8:\n\n...

She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania in 1928 and became a stage actress; her role in the 1932 Broadway production The Warrior’s Husband led to a Hollywood screen test and a contract with RKO studios. In Hepburn’s debut film, A Bill of Divorcement (1932), she starred opposite John Barrymore and was directed by George Cukor, who would become her close friend and helm many of her films (including 1933’s Little Women, 1935’s Sylvia Scarlett, 1938’s Holiday and 1949’s Adam’s Rib).\nHeralded as a fresh, unconventional beauty and a talented actress, Hepburn won her first Best Actress Oscar for only her third film, Morning Glory (1933). A string of films made with RKO had mixed degrees of success, and Hepburn began earning a reputation as arrogant and self-absorbed on set, though she was always meticulously prepared for her roles. She also refused to play by the rules governing typical Hollywood starlets at the time, appearing publicly in pantsuits and without makeup and refusing to sign autographs or grant interviews. After modest successes with Stage Door (1937) and Bringing Up Baby (1938), Hepburn decided to buy out her contract with RKO, a move that gave her unusual control over her career for that time.\nHer faltering image was revived by the success of The Philadelphia Story, which had originally been written for Hepburn to play on Broadway and was then adapted into a hit 1940 movie co-starring Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart. Several years later, Hepburn met the actor Spencer Tracy while co-starring with him in Woman of the Year (1942). Though Tracy, a devout Catholic, remained married, the two began a romantic relationship that would last until Tracy’s death nearly three decades later. (Hepburn had divorced her husband of six years, Ludlow Ogden Smith, in 1934.) On-screen, they acted in nine films together, including Adam’s Rib (1949), Pat and Mike (1952) and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967). Tracy died just weeks after shooting was completed on the last film, for which Hepburn would win her second Best Actress Oscar.\nHepburn was awarded her third Oscar for her starring turn in A Lion in Winter (1968). She continued to appear in films and on television (including an Emmy-winning performance in 1976’s Love Among the Ruins) throughout the next three decades, winning a fourth Best Actress statuette for 1981’s On Golden Pond. Nominated for 12 Academy Awards in her lifetime (a record that would stand until 2003, when Meryl Streep received her 13th nomination), Hepburn never attended the awards show to collect her honors in person. In 1986, she broke her longtime silence about her relationship with Tracy (his widow had died in 1983) in a televised tribute to the actor. She read aloud a poignant letter she had written to him about his drinking, and about their last years together. She later included the letter in her best-selling 1991 autobiography Me: Stories of My Life.\nIn her final screen appearance, in 1994’s Love Affair (a remake of the classic 1939 film), Hepburn appeared frail but composed as ever in her portrayal of the aristocratic aunt of Warren Beatty’s character. In 1999, the American Film Institute (AFI) named Hepburn as the greatest female actress in the history of American cinema. When she died on June 29, 2003, the lights on Broadway were dimmed for an hour to mark the passing of one of entertainment’s brightest stars.\nRelated Videos\n\n\nDOCUMENT 9:\n\nRanking Katharine Hepburn Movies from the Best Katharine Hepburn Movies to ...

Need to know which Katharine Hepburn movie got the best reviews from critics and audiences and which got the worst reviews? Well you have come to the right place….because we have all of that information.\nKatharine Hepburn’s movie career was one heck of a roller coaster ride. The ride started on a high note with an Oscar® win for 1933’s Morning Glory and a blockbuster hit in 1934’s Little Women. She was unable to maintain her early success. The rest of the 1930s did not go very well for her. Hepburn made eleven more movies in the 1930s, and with a couple of exceptions(Alice Adams & Stage Door), they were all box office bombs. After being labeled “box office poison” at the end of the 1930s, she returned to the stage.\nThe return to the stage was in a play called The Philadelphia Story.  Her portrayal of spoiled socialite Tracy Lord received rave reviews. In 1940 Hepburn returned to Hollywood to make the film version of The Philadelphia Story. The film was one of the biggest hits of the year and earned Hepburn her third Oscar® nomination. After that success she appeared for the first time with Spencer Tracy in 1942’s Woman of the Year. Tracy and Hepburn would make nine films together over the next twenty-five years and become one the greatest screen couples ever. Their final appearance together would be 1967’s Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner, which was a blockbuster hit and earned Hepburn her 2nd Oscar® win. The following year she appeared in The Lion in Winter. She amazingly won her 3rd Oscar® win for Best Actress. Following her back to back Oscar® wins, Hepburn’s movie career took another downward spiral.\nFor the next twenty-five years, she would appear in only eight more movies. Most of those movies died at the box office, but she had one more major role left in her. In 1981 she appeared in On Golden Pond opposite Henry Fonda. On Golden Pond was her second biggest box office hit and earned her a record fourth Academy Award® for Best Actress. Her last role was in 1994’s Love Affair.
