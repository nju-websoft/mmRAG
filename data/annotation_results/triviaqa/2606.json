The Food Timeline: history notes--sandwiches The Food Timeline: history notes--sandwiches\nWho invented the sandwich? When? Where? And Why?\nAcknowledging the fact that combinations of bread/pastry filled with meat or cheese and dressed with condiments have been enjoyed since ancient times, Food historians generally attribute the creation of the sandwich, as we know it today, to John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich . This Englishman was said to have been fond of gambling. As the story goes, in 1762, during a 24 hour gambling streak he instructed a cook  to prepare his food in such a way that it would not interfere with his game. The cook presented him with sliced meat between two pieces of toast. Perfect! This meal required no utensils and could be eaten with one hand, leaving the other free to continue the game. Sadly, the name of real inventor of the sandwich (be it inventive cook or the  creative consumer) was not recorded for posterity.\nRecipes for sandwiches were not immediately forthcoming in cookbooks. Why? In England they were  (at first) considered restaurant fare. In America? Many colonial cooks in the last half of the 18th century were not especially fond of imitating British culinary trends. Did colonial American cooks make sandwiches? Probably...most likely, though you will be hard pressed to find solid evidence. When viewed in historical context, it is understandable why Americans didn't begin calling their bread and meat combinations \"sandwiches\" until [long after the Revolution & War of 1812] the late 1830s. The primary difference between early English and American sandwiches? In England beef was the meat of choice; in America it was ham. A simple matter of local protein supply. Or??!  A tasty opportunity to promote government split. You decide.\nThis is what the food historians have to say:\n\"The bread-enclosed convenience food known as the \"sandwich\" is attributed to John Montagu, fourth Earl of Sandwich (1718-1792), a British statesman and notorious profligate and gambler, who is said to be the inventor of this type of food so that he would not have to leave his gaming table to take supper. In fact, Montague was not the inventor of the sandwich; rather, during his excursions in the Eastern Mediterranean, he saw grilled pita breads and small canapes and sandwiches served by the Greeks and Turks during their mezes, and copied the concept for its obvious convenience. There is no doubt, however, that the Earl of Sandwich made this type of light repast popular among England's gentry, and in this way, his title has been associated with the sandwich ever since. The concept is supremely simple: delicate finger food is served between two slices of bread in a culinary practice of ancient origins among the Greeks and other Mediterranean peoples. Literary references to sandwiches begin to appear in English during the 1760s, but also under the assumption that they are a food consumed primarily by the masculine sex during late night drinking parties. The connotation does not change until the sandwich moves into general society as a supper food for late night balls and similar events toward the end of the eighteenth century...Charlotte Mason was one of the first English cookbook authors to provide a recipe for sandwiches...During the nineteenth century, as midday dinner moved later and later into the day, the need for hot supper declined, only to be replaced with light dishes made of cold leftovers, ingredients for which the sandwich proved preeminently suitable. Thus the sandwich became a fixture of intimate evening suppers, teas, and picnics, and popular fare for taverns and inns. This latter genre of sandwich has given rise to multitudes of working class creations...During the early years of the railroad, sandwiches proved an ideal form of fast food, especially since they could be sold at train stations when everyone got off to buy snacks...During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the sandwich came into its own, especially as a response to the Temperance Movement. Taverns and saloons offered free sandwiches with drinks in order to attract customers.\"\n---Encyclopedia of Food and Culture, Solomon H. Katz, editor, William Woys Weaver, assoicate editor [Charles Scribner's Sons:New York] 2003, Volume 3 (p. 235-6)\n[NOTE: This book has far more information than can be paraphrased here. Ask your librarian to help you find a copy.]\n\"The invention of the sandwich and its acceptance as an institution is a typical example of the power of the ways of life to prevail over all so-called rules of gastronomy and even established facts of physiology and psychology. Bread, when cut into slices, has always proved a handy foundation for other food. From the buttered bread and thick slice which was used in the Tudor period as the foundation of meat dishes there is a direct line of descent to the sandwich. But according to all the rules of sciences governing nutrition the sandwich should never have been born. If a slice of bread is spread with some other appetizing food it is obvious to both eyes and nose what it is, and there is a definate psychological reaction. When, however, the appealing surface is covered by another slice of bread, it is a matter of guesswork to find out what the filling is. This is not so easy and often the eater does not try to guess at all but is satisfied with something esay to chew and swallow which satisfies his hunger. The sandwich is thus a poor substitute for a single slice of bread, spread with something won can both see and anticipate in advance. That it has all the same become a staple article of diet is in the first place due to its handiness for carrying, as compared with a slice of bread spread only with butter Sandwiches can replace a meal and avoid the necessity of carrying cooking utensils about. Their popularity owes much to the fact that the distances between home and work have increased enormously in recent times, and they can so easily be wrapped up and stowed away in a man's pocket, In the face of these advantages, the physiological and psychological attractions of a single slice with its surface openly displayed could not prevail. Eating a sandwich requires neither crockery nor cutlery, and as the hand comes in contact only with the dry side of the bread the fingers are not smeared; this even creates the fallacy that dirt from the fingers will not adhere to the bread. The ease of handling has led to further uses of the sandwich. In many countries we find sandwiches set down on plates in the home for lunch or tea, and also at snack-bars...one sandwich tastes much the same as another, unless the filling has a very pronounced flavour...It is only high up in the culinary scale that one finds delicacies spread on bread without the coffin-lid which spells death to the flavour.\"\n---The Origin of Food Habits, H.D. Renner [Faber and Faber:London] 1944 (p. 223-4)\n\"Sandwich. [Said to be named after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich (1718-1792), who once spent twenty-four hours at the gaming-table without other refreshment than some slices of cold beef placed between slices of toast. This account of the origin of the word is given by Grosley [in a publication titled] Londres (1770). Grosley's residence in London was in 1765 and he speaks of the word as having then lately come into use.].\"\n---Oxford English Dictionary\n[NOTE: according to this source, the first printed mention of the word sandwich appeared in a journal entry of Edward Gibbon, 24 November 1762  I dined at the Cocoa Tree...That respectable body...affording every evening a sight truly English. Twenty or thirty...of the first men of the kingdom...supping at little tables...upon a bit of cold meat, or a Sandwich'.]\n\"...[The sandwich] was not known in America until some time later. Eliza Leslie's Directions for Cookery (1837) listed ham sandwiches as a supper dish, but it was not until much later in the century, when soft white bread loaves became a staple of the American diet, that the sandwich became extremely popular and serviceable. By the 1920s white loaf bread was referred to as \"sandwich bread\" or \"sandwich loaf.\"\n---Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 283)\n[1824] To Make Oyster Loaves [some say this the precursor to the New Orleans Po'Boy ]\n\"Take little round loaves, cut off the top, scrape out all the crumbs, then out the oysters into a stew pan with the crumbs that came out of the loaves, a little water, and a good lump of butter; stew them together ten or fifteen minutes, then put in a spoonful of good cream, fill your loaves, lay the bit of crust carefully on again, set them in the oven to crisp. Three are enough for a side dish.\"\n---The Virginia House-Wife, Mary Randolph, with Historical Notes and Commentaries by Karen Hess [University of South Carolina Press:Columbia] 1985 (p. 78)\n[1832] Sandwiches for Travelers (includs bread notes), The Cook's Own Book, Mrs. N.K.M. Lee [Boston]\n\"National\" food observances (months, weeks, days) are popular in the USA. They are hosted by different organizations for specific purposes.\nNational Sandwich Day\nIn the library world, the standard reference tool used for identifying & researching national observances is a book titled Chases' Calendar of Annual Events.  The earliest print reference we find for National Sandwich Day comes from Chase's Calendar of Annual Events, 1981  (p. 110). This source does not credit the  origination of this day to another source. The entry is presented as fact. November 3rd, generally regarded by moderns as the birthdate of the Fourth Earl of  Sandwich , credited for inventing this food. Coincidentally??!  The entry for National Sandwich Month disappeared in 1981. Never to return.\n\"Sandwich Day. Nov. 3. A day to recognize the inventor of the sandwich, John Montague, Fourth Earl of Sandwich, who was born Nov 3, 1718. England's  First  Lord of the Admirality, Secretary of State of the northern Department, Postmaster General, the man after whom Capt. Cook named the Sandwich Islands in 1778.  A rake and a gambler, he is said to have invented the sandwich as a time-saving nourishment while he was engaged in a 24-hour-long gambling session in 1762. He  died in London, April 30, 1792.\"\nWe thought this was the 'end of the story' until we found this (unofficial?) sandwich proclamation circa 1924. Note: the date of publication is November 2nd. The next day was Lord Montague's birthday. Coincidence? We think not.\n\"The day of the sandwiches has arrived. It is so proclaimed by placards and posters plastered over the business districts. A new type of lunchroom substantiates the  announcement--the 'sandwich house.' It may offer side lines of hot dishes and pastries, but to sandwiches it owes its existence. For them it is known and patronized.  In its turn it has served to change the status of the commodity. 'A sandwich used to represent a picnic or a pink tea,' commented one business man addicted to the  habit. 'At best it was just a mouthful of something to eat to tide you over until mealtime. Now it is lunch. You may order something to keep it company, but the  sandwich is the main thing. It is the corn beef and cabbage, the steak and onions, the liver and bacon of other years.' Restaurant keepers agree.One of them in the  financial district, who presides over a chain of sandwich buffets, believes he has hit upon the secret of the business man's desire for his midday meal. Once he was  manager of a large hotel where men came in leisurely, ordered lavishly and ate copiously. That day is gone, he is convinced, as he watches throngs file past his  counters and stacks of sliced bread, meat and cheese disappear. At one of his lunchrooms he feeds 700 at every lunch hour. When the day is over 1,000  sandwiches have usually been consumed. Only 25 per cent of his patrons, he estimated, call for hot dishes--the rest are sandwich eaters. This development has  brought with it all the machinery of sandwich--making, now becoming as common a feature of restaurant windows as the hot cake steam plate New Yorkers know  so well. There is a machine that slices the loaves and another that slices the meat. This last, at the press of a button, cuts and stacks ham, tongue, beef and so one  without touch of human hands. Sandwich-making is thus facilitated and sandwiches themselves have changed not only in status but also in stature and girth. These  sandwiches have little in common with the link tea or picnic offering or even with those pressed slabs in waxed paper piled up at soda fountains, for the business  man's lunch is a high stack of bread, meat and salad, combined, and they make it as you order. The vogue of the sandwich is attributed to a considerable extent to  the rush of modern business life. Men have no time to sit around leisurely waiting for large orders. They must grab a bite, preferably wholesome and satisfying, but  essentially without delay. The sandwich has been found to fill the need. Education, too, it is said, has something to do with the matter. 'Ever since the war people  have seemed to understand eating better than they did before,' said one restaurant keeper. 'Before the war you could not get away with the idea that a sandwich  was enough lunch for a business man. But somehow they have cone to the conviction that a light lunch is the best thing if they expect to go back to the office and do  their best during the afternoon. They have heard, too, that salads are good for you and so they have tried them out and felt much better for the experiment. Salads  and sandwiches--they are the style for a business man's lunch today. That is what they want and that is what they get.\"\n---\"Sandwiches Flourishing,\" New York Times, November 2, 1924 (p. XX2)\nOur research suggests Chicago-based Wheat Flour Institute's sandwich contest was part of the promotional activities during National Sandwich Month , originating in 1952. The sandwich contest may have launched in 1955. The first winners were announced in 1956. Subsequent contests/promotions bore variant names and co-industry sponsorships likewise varied. General notes, gleaned from the New York Times, here:\n\"Donut Week,\" \"Honey for Breakfast Week,\" \"National Kraut and Frankfurter Week\" are all funny, but even funnier is the fact they apparently succeed as promotional schemes. At least they keep coming, which we judge is a mark of success. Latest \"push\" of the kind is \"National Sandwich Month,\" which starts Aug. 1, under the auspices of the Wheat Flour Institute, American Bakers Association and the National Restaurant Association. Bearing down on the sandwich in summer makes, we must admit, sound sense. Cooks find the food easy to fix during weather when any culinary effort is taxing. Eaters take kindly to it, too; it temps even on the hot days, which have been all too numerous recently. We speak here, of course, of the main-dish sandwich for lunch or supper, the kinds pictured today...The Wheat Flour Institute estimates that Americans eat about 27,000,000 sandwiches a day, and it turns out that 40 per cent of all restaurant orders call for sandwiches...Since it came into being, at least so the story goes, in the eighteenth century when it was served as a snack to the reluctant-to-leave-the-gambling-table Earl of Sandwich, it has developed to the point where a whole book has been written on it...Newest contribution to its preparation is \"Fillings Make the Sandwich,\" a leaflet of twenty-six spread recipes in quantity portions (twenty-four) and family-size servings. This is available from the Wheat Flour Institute, 309 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago 6.

The Viking is the creation of Robert Graves of New Orleans,  who has submitted three previous  winners. It is an interesting concoction featuring cream cheese softened with French dressing, sardines and onion slices placed between slices of French bread spread with garlic butter and garnished with stuffed olives and dill pickles.

Among them were the Will Yum Tell, a grilled sandwich of roast pork, sauerkraut, apple sauce, raisins and cheese; the bagelwich, which was similar to a corned beef, swiss cheese and sauerkraut Rubens; the sandwich Wellington, derived from beef Wellington, with a pastry crust topping turkey, ham, relish, mayonnaise and cheese on a bottom slice of rye bread, and the bacon banana bun, built up of those two ingredients on an enriched white bread hot dog roll. \"We think a sandwich is as only as good as the bread it is made on,\" said C. Joan Reynolds, the director of the Wheat Flour Institute. The contest entries were divided into four categories of bread--ethnic (challah, bagels, croissants and pupmpernickle), variety (while wheat, rye, cracked wheat and English muffins), enriched white (hot dog rolls, hamburger rolls and white bread) and hearth (crusty free-formed rolls such as French, Italian, hard rolls and sour dough).

In the case of the Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato sandwich (BLT), culinary evidence confirms this recipe descended from late Victorian-era tea sandwiches. The earliest recipes for BLTs were listed under different names in cookbooks.\nMost of the ingredients of the BLT (bread, bacon, lettuce) were known to the Ancient Romans. Methods for toasting bread were also practiced during this time. Tomatoes were introduced to Europe in the 16th century. Mayonnaise? An 18th century French invention. According to the food historians, modern sandwiches were also invented in the 18th century.  We searched serveral 19th-20th century European and American cookbooks to pin down the introduction of the BLT. It can be argued that the progenitors of BLTs are Club Sandwiches as they are similar in composition and ingredents. About club sandwiches .\n[1920]\n\"Tomato and Bacon Sandwiches.

Some terms have entered familiar language of most Americans--\"BLT\" (a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich)...and others--but most remain part of a bewildering and colorful language specific to the workers in such establishments.\"\n---The Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink, John F. Mariani [Lebhar Freidman:New York] 1999 (p. 190)\nBarry Popik , etymologist expert offers this: \"The BLT sandwich (bacon, lettuce, tomato) possibly comes from Chicago and was named after its famed Chicago Tribune writer BLT, or Bert L. Taylor.  The \"BLT\" is first cited in print in 1941.\"  Our  gut says the initials/acronym is a coincidence. Colorful columnist Bert Leston Taylor (AKA \"BLT\") passed away in 1921.  We think: if Mr. Taylor did not write sometimes write about food in his columns no one would hypothesize a connection. Still? The idea is intriguing. Why not call this sandwich lettuce, bacon, tomato (LBT), tomato lettuce bacon (TLB) or any other variation on this acromymic theme?\nOur survey of historic newspapers/magazines [Proquest Historic Newspapers, NewspaperArchive. com, Readers Guide Retrospective] returned  references for \"BLT\"  sandwiches in 1950. Mainstream print evidence confirms the \"BLT\" raged in the early 1960s but the sandwich acronym was not universally  recognized. How else to explain editors feeling compelled to offer readers explanations?\nFirst surfacing during the Great Depression, early descriptions do not indicate this was a \"make do\" affair for people who could not afford bread. Rather, it was presented as a creative upscale interpretation on a well established theme.  In recent years \"breadless\" sandwiches have been rediscovered as practical solutions for people on bread-free diets.  In fact, people have been stripping bread from sandwiches forever. Think: hamburgers without buns. Today's bread  alternatives feature thinly sliced meat, \"meaty\" vegetables (eggplant, portobello mushrooms) and lettuce. These \"breadless sandwiches\" are often rolled, not sliced.\n[1935]\n\"Three guesses won't reveal the shape and form of the latest innovation in sandwiches. Believe it or not, the newest adaptation of the  sandwich is minus the two ever-present slices of bread. Sandwiches, heretofore, have been known as a snack of some particuarly satisfying morsel thrust between slices of bread. At first, the number of slices was limited to two, and then some one devised a way of piling chicken, tomatoes, bacon, lettuce and dressing together in a mountainous form, and the number of slices was accomodatingly rushed up to three. The club sandwich, as it was named, became famous and other combinations just as satisfying to hungry appetites were brought to light, all including the three slices of toasted bread. These were immediately called double-deckers. Then came the discussion--how should we eat a three-tiered sandwich? There was a general controversy over which it should be, and still the battle is waged, fork vs. fingers for sandwiches. To make matters more complicated; and giving the fork a chance for active play, the sandwich loaf made its appearance. This loaf, as you all must know by now, is a delicate triple-layerd affair generously frosted wtih  creamy cheese. Now the latest in sandwiches, this breadless affair, simply demands the use of a fork, as you will readily note upon reading the recipe. Here it is--the eggplant-tomato sandwich:\n\"Eggplant-tomato sandwich:\nCut slices of eggplant about one-quarter inch thick and dip them in beaten egg which has been seasoned with salt and pepper. Then  crumb with fine bread crumbs and saute in butter or part butter and fat. When the eggplant is tender, put between each two layers of  eggplant a slices of fresh tomato and two strips of bacon about 3 inches in length. The bacon should be previously broiled until crisp and kept warm on the stove. Place soft, melted yellow cheese, on the top layer of each eggplant sandwich and place in the  oven until the cheese has melted. Serve immediately after being removed from the oven. Plan to serve two sandwiches for each person,  as they are bound to make an immediate hit. Garnish the platter with parsley and stuffed olives or radishes. Try eggplant-tomato sandwiches for buffet supper.\"\n---\"'Breadless Sandwich' is Latest Innovation,\" Dorothea Duncan, Washington Post, January 27, 1935 (p.

Why? Long before the advent of modern nutrition   science, people who studied the relationship between food and the human body   recognized the ability of some items to what the appetite and encourage proper   digestion. Apicius [Ancient Rome]contains many such recipes. About appetizers .\nThe serving of savory protein/bread or pastry combinations [croutons, crustades]   continued through the Middle ages, migrating toward refined spicy vinegar-based   specialties of the Renaissance table.  \"Canapes,\" as we known them today,   originated in France. They were a creation of classic French cuisine and, as   such, were quickly adopted by countries (ex. England, United States) in the habit   of following French culinary trends. In other cuisines this concept evolved   differently.\nWhat is a canape?\n\"Canapes--The primary meaning of this word is a slice of crustless bread, cut in rectangular shapes, the size and thickness of which varies depending on the nature of ingredients to be put on them. Canapes which are also called croutons are made of toasted or fried bread and can either be spread with various mixtures or left plain, depending on the nature of the dishes for which they are to serve as an accompaniment. Canapes are mostly used as an accompaniment to winged game, and, in this case, they are spread with a gratin forcemat or some other forcemeat and when actually at table the trail intestines of birds, which are not drawn for cooking, are also  spread on the canapes. Recipes for preparing these will be found under the entries entitled Roties...Canapes (hors-d'oeuvre)--These  canapes, which are made from crustless bread, home-made bread, common brioche or pastry, are garnished with various compositions. Recipes for this type of canape, some of which are referred to as Canapes a la russe, will be found in the section entitled Hors-D'Oeuvre. See Cold  hors-d'oeuvre. Canapes for various dishes--These canapes are cut and browned in the same ways as those described above. They are mostly described as croutons and are used as foundations fro fried or grilled escalopes, noisettes, tournedos,  kidneys, etc.\"\n---Larousse Gastronomique, Prosper Montagne [Crown Publishers:New York] 1961 (p. 208)\nWhat is the derivation of the term and when did it begin to appear in English?\nThis is what the food historians say about canapes:\n\"Canape. A French word which basically means sofa or couch, has become a   culinary term in France since the late 18th century, when it was applied by   analogy to the thin pieces of fried or toasted bread which served as supports for   various savoury toppings. A century later, in the 1890s, it became in English   word referring to a titbit of this kind. Now that yet another hundred years have   passed, the usage continues, although it sounds old-fashioned and is most likely   to be found in contexts such as catered receptions or  'cocktail parties'...Canapes   may be hot or cold. If hot, they come close to what are called savouries in British English.In either case they are capable of being classified as hors   d'oeuvres in some culinary contexts. Large canapes trespass on the territory of the open sandwich. In Italy, the term crostini continues to have much the same meaning as the old French usage.

In the American land of hamburgers & hot dogs, this was a pretty daring and brilliant move.\n\"1961 Truett invents the boneless breast of chicken sandwich, calling it a  \"Chick-fil-A.\" He perfected the recipe over a four-year period using cooking techniques from his mother�s humble boarding  house kitchen.\"\n1/4 cup olives\n1/4 cup mayonnaise\nCut three thin slices of white bread.

No authoritative answers to these questions are available. One legend has it that a man came home late and hungry from his club one night, raided the ice box and made himself a super-sandwich which he dubbed \"club.\" Another says that the chef of some club made himself a reputation by devising this special type of comestible. Anyway, who cares, and what difference does it make? The club sandwich is here to stay. It is a meal in itself, and a meal which may have highly diversified component parts, as long as the principal specifications of toast, meat and salad ingredients are adhered to. Originally it was constructed on the toppling tower plan, but in any other shape it tastes as good and convenience now dictates a more open formation which may be readily attacked. The club sandwich may consist of anywhere from one to five stories. The foundation is always toast, but the superstructure depends on the maker's fancy--and the materials at hand. The sandwich should be eaten with knife and fork.\"\n---Seven Hundred Sandwiches, Florenece A. Cowles [1929] (p. 184-5)\n[NOTE: this book contains 17 different recipes for club sandwiches, including an Open Club Sandwich which is served on three triangular pieces of toast radiating from the center of the plate.

The earliest recipes for food like these are found in Ancient Roman cookbooks. Modern grilled cheese sandwiches descended from these ancient recipes.\nWho invented the grilled cheese Americans know today? We will never know, but we can (given the ingredients) place it in time. Culinary evidence suggests our modern grilled cheese (consisting of processed cheese and sliced white bread) began in the 1920s. That's when affordable sliced bread and inexpensive American cheese hit the market. Goverment issue cookbooks tell us World War II Navy cooks broiled hundreds of \"American cheese filling sandwiches\" in ship's kitchens. This makes sense. The sandwich was economical, easy to make, met government nutrition standards.\nWhy is Grilled Cheese paired with Tomato Soup?\nPost WWII institutional foodservice (including school cafeterias) paired grilled cheese with tomato soup to provide the required Vitamin C component. It was also economical and easy:\n\"Soups. The use of canned soups for all types of school food serve can add variety as well as good nutirtion to the menu.

Are they the same thing? On the surface, recipes for both produce somewhat similar results (melted cheese nestled between two slices of crisp, warm, buttered bread). Actually? Food historians tell us this a linguistic puzzle. Notes here:\n\"Toast...is made by placing a slice of bread in front of dry heat-a fire, a grill, or an electric      toaster...Certainly, toast has a long history in Britain.   Tost was much used in the Middle      Ages, being made in the ordinary way at an open fire...Often toast was spread with      toppings...Meat toppings for toast became fashionable in during the 16th century...Towards the end of the 16th century all knds of things began to appear on toast....[including] melted  cheese.\"\n---Oxford Companion to Food, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 796-7)\n\"Grill...to cook by direct exposure to radiant heat, as in when a piece of meat is placed on a grill...The North American word for the verb grill is broil.\"\n---ibid (p. 354)\nA survey of American cookbooks reveals that recipes titled for \"toasted cheese\" sandwiches      predate those titled \"grilled cheese.\" Other names for this dish exist too. A careful examination of ingredients and method confirm the connection. The term \"grilled cheese\" surfaces in American print during the 1930s. This coincides with the introduction of portable electic cooking tools, courtesy of Thomas Alva Edison. The Edicraft brand Sandwich Grill (also Deep Grill Plate,  Waffle Baker) were weclomed by modern American housewives. Table cookery was not new: chafing dishes were popular from the 1890s forward. Late 19th/early 20th century American cookbooks regularly offer recipes for cheese toast (melted cheese served on  toast points, no top). Cheese is typically grated or creamed into a \"butter.\" Cayenne and mustard, traditional Rarebit ingredients, are not strangers to early grilled cheese.\n\"Grilled cheese\" sandwich recipes through time\n[1902]\n\"Cheese Boxes\nCut stale bread in one-third inch slices, remove crusts, and cut slices in pieces three by one and one-half inches.

Gladys cooked all the traditional Southern favorites. Grits and black-eyed peas were served, ham and bacon were an occasional treat, and there was  always fried chicken, cornbread, mashed potatoes, and plenty of homemade country gravy. Elvis Presley was Southern-born and Southern-bred. his culinary tastes never varied far from Southern-style home cooking, altough he was exposed to, and did enjoy, certain  Oriental foods that contained such ingredients as pork...Elvis played hard, worked hard, and ate hard, and he preferred  rib-sticking kinds of foods. Elvis did not develop much of a taste for exotic or foreign foods. Nor did he consider trying ay dish that contained unusual ingredients or had an odd texture or flavor...At home, the King always specified exactly what foods should be kept on hand, whether at his Graceland masion in Memphis or at his house in Beverly Hills. His list always included fresh, lean, ground round, hamburger buns, rolls, at least six cans of ready-to-bake biscuits, pickles, potatoes, onions,  shredded coconut, fudge cookies, assorted fresh fruit, canned sauerkraut, mustard, and peanut butter. His refrigerator also contained at least three bottles of mlk or half-and-half, thin-sliced, lean bacon, vanilla and chocolate ice cream, and freshly squeezed orange juice.

Certainly, the ingredients (lamb, pita bread, grilled vegetables, & seasonings) were known to Ancient peoples of the Middle East. Kebabs (roasted skewered meat) and other spiced meat minces have been sold by Middle Eastern and Greek street vendors for hundreds of years. Doner kebabs have been popular in Europe (especially Germany) in the second half of the 20th century.\nThe Arabs, Turks, and Greeks all make a variation on the same theme of vertical rotissing seasoned meat. The Turks call it doner kebabi, the Greeks gyro...and the Arabs shawurma. It is said that the doner kebabi was born in the Anatolian town of Bursa.\"\n--A Mediterranean Feast, Clifford A.

The sweet that accompanies it was actually the essence of the dish, the judhaba proper. It was a sort of sweetened Yorkshire pudding, stuck under the meat as it roasted to catch running fat and meat juices...The only surviving tenth-century cookbook, Kitab al-Tabikh, the contents of which date mostly from the ninth century, gives no fewer than nineteen recipes.\"\n---\"What to Order in Ninth-Century Baghdad,\" Charles Perry, Medieval Arab Cookery, Essays and tranlations by Mxime Rodinson, A.J.

Food historians generally agree the name \"gyro\" and the current product are both recent inventions, originating in the New York. According to the New York Times, modern gyros were very popular in the city during the early 1970s. They were marketed as fast food and embraced by diners looking for something different.\n\"Gyro. A Greek-American sandwich made from rotisserie-roasted, seasoned lamb that is sliced and served with onions in a pocket of pita bread. The word (which first appears in print in 1970) is from the Greek gyros, meaning a \"turn\" and is pronounced \"JEER-o.\" The dish is better known in America than in Greece and possibly created in New York, where gyros are sold at Greek lunch counters and by street vendors, although some say it originated in the Plaka neighborhood of Athens. It is not a dish found in classic Greek cookery or listed in Greek cookbooks. It also seems possible that the name \"gyro\" may have some association with the Italian-American sandwich called Hero.\"\n---Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink, John F.

In a heavily trafficked areas such as Times Square, three stores have opened in the last two months. Why has the Greek Gryo gained a prominent place in the fast food race? Store owners, patrons and native Greeks agree that the two major reasons are that the gyro is \"different\" and \"delicious...The increase in the snack's popularity may be related to the large number of Americans who visit Greece and sample the local cuisine...The term gyro denotes a ring or circle and refers to the rotation of the meat as it is cooked. Greek historians attribute the origin of the dish to soldiers from the army of Alexander the great, who skewered their meat on long knives and cooked it by repeated turning over an open firet.

Slices are cut from the surface as it reaches the required degree of 'oneness', and are typically eaten with pitta bread or rice. Turkish immigrants have brought it to many parts of Europe, and sicee the early  1970s the doner kebab house has become a familiar part of the British inner-city scene. The term means literally 'turing roast meat', incidentally (doner derives from the verb donmek, 'turn, rotate'); and the Turkish letter o is pronounced similarly to  German o (the closest English sound is er). The Arabic word for the dish is shawarma.\"\n---An A to Z of Food & Drink, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 111)\n\"Doner kebab...has become a familiar sight in western countries wherever Turkish immigrants have become established...When   Turks began to work in large numbers in Germany during the 1960s, their food followed but, although much liked by the immigrants, it did no find favour with Germans until the ofering was dressed up as a pitta bread sandwich filled with the doner meat, a salad of shredded lettuce, and a sauce (usually chilli, barbeque, or garlic). The meat itself may be lamb, beef, or chicken and will be both thinly sliced 'leaves' and minced or minced and ground...Doner kebab is very significant in Austria, Denmark, and Britain... It is also important in Australia, alhtoug it may go under different names (depending upon which immigrant group is more important) such as souvlaki or gyros. In Canada their is a variation called Donair, named after a Halifax restaurant which invented it in 1973. The gyro of Greece (also named for its turning action) is the same but different. Clifford Wright suggests it was not introduced into Greece itself until after the exchange of populations between Turkey and Greece in the 1920s. It too has travelled,  particularly to America and Australia...The shawarma of the Middle East...is broadly similar, although the meat may be more highly spiced, and other sauces such as tahini may be offered.\"\n---Oxford Companion to Food, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2006 (p. 254-5)\n\"In Turkey, doner kebab consists of thin cuts of lamb laid over warm \"fladenbrot,\" a round flat loaf similar to pita, and steeped in tsatsiki sauce, with tomatoes, onions, and lettuce on the side. It is usually served in sit-down restaurants. In Germany, \"doner,\" has taken on a sandwich form, and is sold from small booths catering to takeout customers. The meat is slowly roasted on a vertical spit, sliced almost paper-thin, and then stuffed into a triangular piece of fladenbrot, topped by the vegetables. For about 60 cents more, a few slabs of feta cheese are included. The sauces - garlic or tomato-based and ranging from tangy to sharp - often vary. \"The different doner booths make their own sauces according to their own recipes,\" says Tuncay Zulkaflu, owner of Knig Doner in Dresden. What makes \"Istanbul Doner,\" another doner booth in Dresden and two-time winner of a magazine-sponsored survey for the city's best doner, so popular? \"The sauces,\" answers a worker there. \"It is a very special recipe, but it is a secret, so I can't say [what it is]...There are an estimated 9,300 doner vendors in Germany...As far as the doner's place on the German snack circuit, \"It is equal to the bratwurst or bockwurst,\" says Uwe Stuhrberg, editor at Sax Magazine, which conducted the doner surveys. According to a 1998 study on doner by the Turkish Studies Center at Essen University, the average German eats eight doners per year. Not bad for a sandwich developed less than thirty years ago, when Turkish \"guest workers\" in Germany, who found themselves unemployed in the midst of the '70s economic crisis, starting selling doners to support their families. Back then, vendors prepared the meat themselves and sold it from street corners. It remained mainly a mom-and-pop industry until German reunification, when vendors tapped into the East German market.\"\n---\"More Germans nix kraut for kebabs,\" Omar Sacirbey, Christian Science Monitor, August 25, 1999, FOOD; Pg. 17\nDoner University: Germany kebab qualification for students\nOur research indicates Turkish-style kebabs were enjoyed in Germany in the early 19th century. These were coated with bread crumbs. Perhaps this was a forerunner?\n\"Small chunks of lamb, mutton and pork can be treated in the same way [placed on a spit over a moderate coal fire. As  soon as the pieces, which should should not be too close together, begin to exude their fat, they should be sprinkled with a mixture of fine salt and fine breadrumbs and this should be continued until no more fat appears.

Tiny branches of bay, sage, rosemary or other bitter, aromatic herbs can also be placed between the pieces of meat as long as they do not create too strong a flavour. The pieces should not be too close together. A little more salt should be applied under the breadcrumbs than is necessary for the eel and, if desired, a little of the favourite household seasoning can also be used.\"\n---The Essence of Cookery, Karl Friedrich Von Rumohr, Translated by Barbara Yeomans, originally published in Germany in 1822  [Prospect Books:London] 1993 (p. 78)\nThe Horseshoe sandwich belongs to Springfield, Illinios. Local folks confirm the moniker was bestowed for the horse shoe shape of the meat. The french fries represent the nails in the shoe and the oversized platter is the anvil. The \"Ponyshoe\" sandwich is a smaller version.\n\"Ask anybody about the inventor of this cardiac-arrest concoction and you're likely to get two or three different names. Some say Joe Schweska created the first Horseshoe at the Old Leland Hotel in 1928. Others point to Steve Tomko at Wayne's Red Coach Inn as the originator. No matter, from the first bite you'll roll your eyes skyward and thank the heavens for such a creation. The Horseshoe is made by laying two pieces of toasted bread on a warm platter, then layering meat (the original recipe called for ham) over the toast. Next smother the entire plate with a rich cheese sauce and circle the platter with crispy french fries. Since its creation more than 70 years ago, many have duplicated the Horseshoe. While there are endless variations of meat and/or vegetable combinations, ranging from ham to corned beef, from bacon and egg to sauted vegetables, most agree that the key to a great Horseshoe is the cheese sauce. Some swear by beer, others use wine, still others are loyal to the Welsh rarebit sauce said to have been used in the original 1928 recipe. For a truly original dish, try the Horseshoe at many local restaurants and pubs, including Norb Andy's, Maldaner's, and D'Arcy's Pint. It's Springfield's original comfort food.\"\n--- Springfield Illinois Convention & Visitors Bureau\n\"The Horseshoe has been a staple of politicans, public officals, bureaucrats, secretaries, salesmen, and Springfield residents  for 50 years. It was created in 1928 at the now-defunct Leland Hotel, once the creme de la creme of late night watering holes for politicians gathered at the state capitol a few blocks away. It is simply an open face sandwich filled with any variety and combination of  ingredients and topped with a sharp cheese sauce embedded with french fried potatoes. The combination is not unusual but the appearance is different and unless the diner is particularly fastidious, he can cram his mouth with a combination of meat, egg, potatoes, bread, and  sauce with one sweep of a fork. \"It's a real meal-in-one sandwich,\" says Wayne Coumbes, owner of Wayne's Red Coach Inn, which boasts it has the  original Horseshoe recipe and serve 300 Horseshoes daily. A chef named Steven Tomko created the Horseshoe for the Leland and Coumbes wound up with the recipe after a series of partnerships in other restaurants, including one that Tomko once operated. \"It was named after the  horseshoe cut of ham. The hot, sizzler platter it's served on is supposed to represent the blacksmith's anvil and the french fries represent the nails for the horseshoe...Peggy Haynes, a cook at Norb Andy's restaurant, which has been preparing Horseshoes since the  late 1950s, recalls that \"when the sandwich first was made, the french fries were real thick and they only put a few of them around the edges so they looked like nails stuck in the horseshoe.\"...\"The sauce makes the difference,\" says Coumbes. The original recipe calls for a white sauce made of butter and cream and a sharp cheddar cheese...At Norb Andy's, the recipe has been doctored to include a dash of white wine, \"which cuts the sharpness of the cheese.\" And other Springfield establishments use a spash of beer to concoct their own versions. Almost every restaurant offers a choice of ham, chicken, turkey, hamburger, egg, and shrimp as a basic filling, and allows two choices without extra charge. Perhaps the most amazing thing about Horseshoes is their price. At the Red Coach Inn, the sandwich sells for $2.25...To the uninitiated palate, the most common taste among the Horseshoe variations is the ham choice,  which mingles with the cheese sauce to create a food sensation similar to the Monte Cristo sandwich.\"\n---\"Du Jour: The eat horseshoes don't they? Yes, but only in Springfield, F. Richard Cioccone, Chicago Tribune, June 4, 1979 (p. B1)\nOpen, hot roast beef [or turkey] sandwiches slathered with gravy and served with mashed potatoes are popular in many parts of the country. They are known by different names according to region: \"Roast Beef Commercials\" in the upper mid-west (Minnesota), \"Hot Beef,\" (South Dakota), \"Roast Beef Manhattans\" in central mid-west (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois), \"Hot Roast Beef Sandwich\" on both coasts.  These economical belly-filling simple dishes are generally served (no matter what they're called) in working-class eateries and community dinners. Every once in a while you find hot roast beef/turkey type entrees in trendy restaurants experimenting with retro comfort fare.\nWhere did the idea come from? Cookbooks confirm people have been serving sliced/diced meats mixed with sauce over starches (bread, noodles, rice) for hundreds of years. This type of meal was generally served to  family, as it generally used leftovers. Protein sources vary according to place and period: chipped (dried, frizzled) beef on toast was well-known by American pioneers. Many popular variations did not include meat (Welsh Rarebit, Biscuits & Gravy) or included scant pieces of meat in the gravy (ham gravy).\nThis 1877 recipe for \"Beefsteak Toast\" is not so very different from the modern version.\n[1900]\n\"Just at present there is a big run on the hot roast beef sandwich, with the bread soaked in gravy, with gravy in the plate and gravy poured over it all. The general appearance is that of a tired ark in a gravy flood. Though unattractive to look at it eats all right, which is the main point. Certain restaurants have been charging 30 cents for it without accessories, but a new pace has been opened in a basement of Nassau Street [New York City] were the price is 20 cents, with mashed or baked potatoes and bread  and butter. The saving of 10 cents and the additional provender have drawn to the cellar so large a number of the hungry that hundreds have to wait fifteen or thirty minutes for tables or counters at which to eat.\"\n---\"Popular Luncheons,\" Washington Post, May 16, 1900 (p. 6)\n[1935]\n\"Hot Sandwiches.

They are a prominent feature of popular priced and quick luch laces and may of the best hotels run one or more hot sandwiches each day. As generally made in the European plan hotel, two slices of bread are laid on a platter, side by sied; then the sliced meat is placed on the bread, over which is poured the gravy (real gravy, not the messy kind), and alongside it a garnish of mashed potatoes.

New Zealanders, among others, grate the cheese and mix it with beaten egg, as does the chef at Scotland's Fortingall  Hotel. It is a 'Cheese Dream' in many English-speaking regions, and there are variastions known as Croque Mademoiselle and Croque  Madame--Donn Pearce's recipe, from San Francisco, includes sliced mushrooms; in Paris Simone Beck's puffy feminine version is flavored with cognac, kirsh, or rum, and both are run under the broiler at the last moment.

Any combinations can be used.) Close the sandwiches with the other pieces of bread, butter side down, and press firmly. Heat a large skillet or pancake griddle, melt several tablespoonfuls of clarified butter (or oil and butter--straight unclarified butter will burn), and when sizzling add the Croques Monsieur. Cook on each side about 3 minutes, pressing down with the spatula and adding a little more butter before turning.  Serve the golden Croques hot, cutting in quarters if they are to be used as appetizers.\"\n---The World of Cheese, Evan Jones [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 1976  (p. 159)\n[NOTE: Happy to send the Cheese Bread referenced above.]\nThese exquisite works of edible art descend from practical traditions:\n\"Smorrebrod can be anything between heaven and earth. Primarily it consists of a piece of bread of some kind. The Danes make most use of rye bread because it is more suitable than other varieties for many of their sandwiches...Upon the bread something, generally butter, is in most cases spread. As one would expect, when the Danes spread the fine butter for which they are famous, they spread it generously. Not only because it gives them vitamin A or because they like the taste but also because fatstuffs help to keep out the cold. And keeping out the cold is important for most of the Danish year. Though butter ranks first as \"the something to spread\", spiced lard or pork dripping, maybe even goose or duck dripping, are often used. Not only, in the case of the pork fat, as an economy measure but because the Danes prefer fat to butter when liverpaste, salt meats and most kinds of sausage, are to be the crowning glory of the smorrebrod. When it comes to the question of what to put on the \"buttered bread\" (The Danish works for \"butter\" and \"to butter\" are the same as for \"grease\" and \"to grease\" so the expression \"buttered bread\" include bread spread with dripping of one kind or another) the only answer can be: \"There is absolutely nothing edible which cannot be used for smorrebrod\". The Danish town housewife patronizes the charcuterie of cooked meat shop around the corner; her country sister may bu certain kinds of pale (literally \"something laid on\", i.e. any fish, meat, vegetable etc. used on the buttered bread) from the butcher who brings his mobile shop to her door...Above all both town and country housewife will make use of leftovers from paleg. \"Leftovers embraces anything from slices of cold pork sausage garnished with a remnant of red cabbage to slices taken from a still substantial joint of meat. It is this use of lefovers which makes smorrebrod such a useful thing to know about in order to be able to cope in an interesting yet substantial manner with those unexpected guests...The average dane has only one hot meal daily. For lunch and/or supper he eats smorrebrod.\"\n---Oskar Davidsen book of Open Sandwiches, compiled by James R. White from traditional Danish recipes and specialties of the House of Oskar Davidsen [Host & Sons Forlag:Copenhagen], 3rd revised edition, 1962 (p. 9-10)\n\"The Sandwich Story Somewhere in the centre of Copenhagen there ought to be a monument to the man or woman who discovered smorrebrod, the open sandwich which is Denmark's national dish. An appropriate site would be the Town Hall end of the new Hans Andersen Boulevard, for the inventor of smorrebrod obviously had something of a fantasy of the great Danish storyteller. Alas, historians are silent as to the identity of the man wo first placed fish, fowl, meat and vegetables on a piece of buttered bread. Some Danish encyclopedias do not even list one of the most important words in the Danish language. The inventor of the smorrebrodsseddel or sandwich list is, however, known. And nobody has ever disputed that it was not untul old Oskar Davidsen acceeded to the request of young Axel Svensson to be allowed to make something amusing out of the restaurant's sandwich list that open sandwiches in all their infinite variety began to develop into what they are today...The origin of the sandwich is a subject on which even historians can but speculate. Some suggest that recognisable sandwiches were known in ancient Babylon, wothers that a rabbi contrived them for the Passover by placing bitter herbs between two slices of unleavened bread to symbolise Jewish privations in Egypt. When smorrebrod first saw the light of day is equally a matter for speculation. Certainly it appeared centuries before an Earl of Sandwich first placed pieces of meat between two slices of bread to enable his guests to eat without leaving the card table. The Danish workd simply means \"buttered bread\". But the origins of open sandwiches can be traced back to the days when, in Denmark as elsewhere, a round of bread served as a plate for both hot food and cold. Naturally the rich refrained from eating their plates but these, soaked in nourishing gravy from the main course, invariably found their way to the mouths of the serfs or deserving poor of the parish. And between rich and poor there was doubtless a class which ate both bread-plate and the delicacies which reposed upon it. As yet...this open sandwich could not have been known as smorrebrod for butter was still unknown in Denmark...The earliest mention of the word smorrebrod is found in the works of the playwright Ludvig Holberg (168401754) who describes the diet of the gentry as consisting of soup, salt meat or smorrebrod. No mystery, however, surrounds the invention of the smorrebrodsseddel or printed list of open sandwiches. It was Emil Bjorn, head waiter at the Copenhagen officers' club, who, when harried by shouted orders from the card tables, conceived, in 1883, the idea of lists on which the guests could mark off  their requirements. Bjorn's idea was soon adopted by restaurants throughout the country, but many years were to pass before these scant lists were developed into what they are in Denmark today.\"\n---ibid (p. 11-12)\nPanini\nOur survey of historic cookbooks and food articles confirm grilled sandwiches, including those cooked with special apparatus designed for the purpose, have been popular from the beginning of the 20th century forwards. Electric sandwich makers were just as intriguing to folks in the 1930s as they are they are today. Think: Grilled Cheese . Food historians generally agree panini (plural, the singular is panino), as we Americans know them today, originated in the panintecas (sandwich shops) of Italy, perhaps as early as the 1960s. Our survey of newspaper articles confirms panini origin captured American attention in the mid-1970s. As time progressed, panini evolved from upscale fare to trendy sandwiches for the masses. Industry experts credit novel combinations (ingredients/textures) and the product's *staying power* (they can be made ahead of time) for paninis modern success.   In the 1990s, panini nudged their way into family restaurants and institutional menus (colleges, hospitals, airports). Sales of panini grills soared, both commercial and home versions. Frozen panini products happened.\n\"For centuries bread was the complete meal par excellence, until it became the support or container for a condiment or  filling, without losing the identity associated with its linguistic diminutive [panino, diminutive of pane, denotes a sandwich in Itlian--Trans.]\"\n---Italian Cuisine: A Cultural History, Alberto Capatti & Massimo Montanari [Columbia University Press:New York] 1999 (p. 153)\n\"Panino...\"small bread.\" Small sandwich.

Flavor is the key to panini, which are based on high-quality Italian artisan breads like focaccia or ciabatta. The sandwiches are layered, but not overstuffed, with flavorful combinations of cheeses, meats, or roasted vegetables. Various dressings or condiments are added, and the sandwich is pressed and lightly grilled.

Smith editor [Oxford University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 2 (p. 235)\n\"[Panini] are said to have originated in Lombardy, Italy, in response to the demand among Milanese office workers for a quick lunch without sacrifice in flavor and quality. In both Italy and the United States, panini are eaten for lunch and as snacks and appetizers. In Italy, sandwich shops traditionally wrap the bottom of the panino in a crisp white paper napkin, providing a practical solution to drips while enchancing aesthetics. Quality Italian bread is an absolute must for a killer panini, and most sandwich chefs will opt for a relatively thin artisan bread like grooved focaccia or ciabatta, slicing it in half  horizontally. Panini are always grilled, so most restaurants and cafes have invested in professional grooved sandwich presses that flatten and heat the sandwich while creating a crunch, buttery outer crust.\"\n---American Sandwich: Great Eats from all 50 States, Becky Mercuri [Gibbs Smith:Salt Lake City UT] 2004 (p. 81)\nThe earliest print reference we find for panini (as a food) in an American newspapers is 1956.

Pretty soon, you'll start noticing restaurant menus and sandwich shops featuring panini (plural) exclusively. You'll find them at such places as the MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) cafe, Il Panino, in the new downtown museum complex, and at a spot in Beverly Hills called Giannino's. You'll see them on the menu at Il Piccolino and at Angeli Caffe, both in Los Angeles, and you'll see them at picnics and party buffets.An Italian might shrug if you ask the origin of panino. Said Celestino Drago, who operates Il Panino, \"No one ever asks where or how they came about. They are just there.\" In Italy, panini are everywhere. They are fast food eaten on the run, to and from work, on the job, in train stations, in cars on the street. Sky-high piles of panini are packed in glass cases at almost every bakery and coffee shop for the hordes who want to grab a bite before or after work or a movie. Mothers pack them in schoolchildren's lunch bags. The ever-growing numbers of young, fast food lovers in Italy, called paninari, prefer the social scene at sandwich shops and McDonald's golden arches to the family dinner table, where every family member should be, but no longer is, to the chagrin of traditionalists bemoaning the disintegration of the Italian family fiber. In Milan, upscale paninotecas have emerged only in the last five years as havens for gourmet sandwich-eaters, who stand at tables to nibble on such fillings as duck or wild boar prosciutto while sipping fine wine. In Los Angeles, the panino has just begun to find a place among those who enjoy Italian flavors and great bread. For it's the bread that distinguishes every panino. The word derives from the word pane, meaning bread. There are dozens of different types of bread used for panini. Every region in Italy boasts a specialty. In Tuscany, you'll find michetta, a roll with a hole in middle, a strong favorite, whereas in Milan the specialty is rosetta, a rosette-shaped roll, and in Genoa it is focaccia, a flatbread with baked-on flavorings such as pesto, garlic butter and onions. The rolls may be elongated, round, square or flat. They may be seasoned or not. We give a few recipes for dough typically used in panini, but you can also use store-bought rolls and loaves found in fancy food shops as well as the neighborhood supermarket. Some Italian bakeries such as Il Fornaio in Beverly Hills and Santa Monica carry several popular panino varieties used by Il Panino, including michetta and ciabatta. Kaiser rolls, onion rolls and the like are ideally suited for panini. Square loaves such as pane in cassetta, ideal for grilling, can easily be substituted with firm-textured white or wheat bread. In Italy, with the exception perhaps of those found at paninotecas in Milan, panino fillings tend to be traditional types-sausage, roast peppers, cheeses, tomatoes, vegetables, mortadella, salamis and other sausages. In Sicily, veal and chicken cutlets are slapped between two pieces of bread. Roast peppers are also a popular panino filling. The panini appearing in Los Angeles, however, are something else. \"They are not as fancy as those you'd find at the paninotecas in Milan, because we want to educate slowly, but they are interesting,\" Drago said. Actually, anything goes. At the MOCA cafe, Il Panino, Drago has introduced eight sandwich fillings that are California variations on the traditional Italian theme. In a sandwich called Milano, sliced turkey is served with California goat cheese, avocado, sun-dried tomatoes, and arugula. A smoked salmon and mascarpone cheese filling is garnished with salmon roe, capers and chives. Evan Kleiman, chef and co-owner of Angeli, a California-style Italian restaurant, fell in love with the sandwiches on her first visit to Italy at the age of 16 and does take-offs on traditional themes. \"You open your mind to what is put in between two pieces of bread,\" she said. A sandwich Kleiman has called panino rustico contains chicken salad, dressed with Dijon mustard and arugula. This and other fillings such as roast pork are found in her book, \"Cucina Fresca,\" co-authored with Viana La Place (Harper & Row: 1985). The roast pork is seasoned with Dijon mustard and topped with pickled onions. Dino Baglioni of Il Piccolino restaurant in Los Angeles serves several types of panini, including some using long, tapered rolls and round ones. They may be filled with red and green peppers and sausages; veal scaloppine with mozzarella cheese or ricotta cheese with prosciutto. There is also a sandwich made with smoked salmon, horseradish and capers. At Giannino's, the paninoteca in Beverly Hills, the sandwiches are simple and basic. Nothing fancy here. The sandwich called Godfather contains ham, mortadella, provolone and mixed peppers; the Capone has capocollo (sausage) and mixed peppers, and the tachinello contains smoked turkey and Swiss cheese.\" Panino Translated as \"little loaf,\" panino is known throughout Italy as a sandwich you pick up on the go.

In coffee bars, cafes and delis everywhere, soon you'll hear: \"Give me a grilled veggie panino.\" The distinctive little sandwich familiar at way stations on Italian autostradas, the pressed panino (panini in the plural) is gaining a foothold in Washington. Picture a good old grilled cheese, but without the grease, layered with sauteed vegetables or deli meats or a combination. Light, flavorful and, yes, oh-so-trendy, panini (like coffee bars) have leap-frogged across the country. From Seattle to Chicago to Dallas, hot pressed sandwiches, made with focaccia or rustic bread, striped with grill marks, are a have-to-have with that latte. \"People want a little something other than sweets at a coffee bar,\" says Joel Edwards, president of Issaquah, Washington State-based Caffe Andiamo, which manufactures a panini press called Pane Bella Grill. \"And for cafe owners panini are a way to attract that 11-to-2 customer base.\" Edwards credits Nordstrom stores with spreading the craze eastward. All Nordstrom espresso bars feature pressed panini. \"What's unique is the press itself,\" says restaurant consultant Mark Caraluzzi, co-owner of Bistro Bistro and D'Angelo. \"It's a gentle heat that crisps the bread but steams the inside so it doesn't dry out.\" Grill stripes, Caraluzzi contends, let the customer know his sandwich was not browned in a puddle of oil. \"We are the grilling country,\" he says.\"\n---\"Let Them Eat Panini,\" Walter Nicholls, The Washington Post, July 5, 1995, (p. E11)\n[2002]\n\"Panini grills have been around for more than 100 years, but were generally ignored in the United States until the Italian grilled sandwiches made with them began to show up in carryout shops and on restaurant menus. Now these grills are set to become the Belgian-waffle irons of the 21st century. Two years ago, I couldn't find anything called a panini grill. Suddenly, there are all kinds of possibilities. Eat your heart out, Dagwood. Panini are nothing more than grown-up cheese-and-meat sandwiches toasted on a ridged grill that has a weighted top to press down the sandwich to the thickness of a waffle. It is that weighted top that seems to draw men to panini grills. They are the functional equivalent of something you might cook with in the yard. ''Men have taken to the panini grill like they took to barbecue,'' said Michael Chiarello, the host of a cooking show on public television that is based in the Napa Valley.

Compare with\nWho invented this popular sandwich, why & when? The when is easy to document, the why is a relatively simple matter of technology, economics & commerce. The who? Is still a mystery.\nLet's start with a quick study of the ingredients. Food historians tell us that finely chopped nuts (especially almonds) were regularly used by ancient cooks in a variety of dishes. BUT! It wasn't until the late 19th century that peanut butter...as we know it...came on the market. Did you know that peanut butter was first marketed as a health food? Ancient cooks also knew how to preserve fruit. BUT!  It wasn't until the 15th century that modern jellies/jams/preserves were made. Ancient cooks also made bread. BUT! Sliced pre-packaged bread...the stuff we Americans use today to make our peanut butter & jelly sandwiches...didn't happen until the late 1920s. Interesting, yes? More notes on the history of PB&J ingredients:\nsliced white bread .\n\"The first located reference to the now immortal peanut butter and jelly sandwich was published by Julia Davis Chandler in 1901. This immediately became a hit with America's youth, who loved the double-sweet combination, and it has remained a favorite ever since...During the early 1900s peanut butter was considered a delicacy and as such it was served at upscale affairs and in New York's finest tearooms. Ye Olde English Coffee House made a \"Peanut Butter and Pimento Sandwich.\" The Vanity Fair Tea-Room served its peanut butter with watercress...The Colonia Tea-Room served peanut butter on toast triangles and soda crackers. That peanut butter could be combined with so many divers products demonstrated that it was a relatively neutral platform providing a nutty taste and a sticky texture that bound together various ingredients.\nPeanut butter sandwiches moved down the class structure as the price of peanut butter declined due to the commercialization of the industry. Peanut butter's use also moved down the age structure of the nation as manufacturers added sugar to the peanut butter, which appealed to children. The relationship between children and peanut butter was cemented in the late 1920s, when Gustav Papendick invented a process for slicing and wrapping bread. Sliced bread meant that children could make sandwiches themselves without slicing the bread with a potentially dangerous knife. As a consequence of low cost, high nutrition, and ease of assembling, peanut butter sandwiches became one of the top children's meals during the Depression. \"\n---Peanuts: The Illustrious History of the Goober Pea, Andrew F.

Cowles [Little,Brown:New York]\nPeanuts (aka ground-nuts, ground-peas, goober peas) are a new world food. Archaeological evidence suggests the first peanut butters (ground peanuts, really) were made by Ancient South American Indians. Peanuts were introduced to the the Old World by European explorers. These nuts thrived in Africa. Historians tell us that peanuts were introduced to North America by Europeans via Africa.\nPeanut butter, as we know it today, was introduced in the second half of the 19th century.  It was originally promoted  as a health food. Nut butters were valued for their high protein content and easy digestion. Peanut butter was a perfect alternative to meat in a time when the industry was rife with public health concerns. At first, peanut butter was a food known mostly to wealthy people who frequented health spas. Before long, the product was available to the public at large, though companies targeted their promotions to the upper classes. Recipes for early 20th century fancy tea sandwiches sometimes included \"nut butter.\" When that market was saturated, companies began adding sugar to make the product more appealing to children. Bingo! The popularity of the product soared and to this day is a staple in most American pantries. Peanut butter & jelly sandwiches & Peanut butter  cookies have become standard American fare.\nFood historians currently entertain several theories regarding the origin (invention, if you will) of peanut butter. While ground peanuts were used by native Amercans and Africans early on, John Harvey Kellogg (of Battle Creek Michigan cereal fame) was the first person to obtain an American patent for the process [1895]. In the late 19th century many American households owned grinders for coffee and meat. Special grinders were also made purposely for grinding nuts.\n\"Early peanut butters had several problems. The first was that peanut oil has a melting point below room temperature. Gravity separated the oil, which then oxidized  and turned rancid. Likewise, salt added to the peanut butter separated and crystallized. Grocers received peanut butter in tubs or pails and were advised to use a  wooden paddle to stir it frequently...During the early years of the twentieth century, William Norman, an English chemist, invented a method of saturating  unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, thus preventing them from turning rancid. In 1922, Joseph L. Rosefield...applied these principles to peanut butter. He  developed a process to prevent oil separation and spoilage in peanut butter. He removed 18 percent of the liquid oil and replaced it with an equal amount of  hydrogenated oil, which was solid at room temperature. The result was a semisolid peanut butter; no oil rose to the surface. The peanut butter was thick and  creamy and did not stick to the roof of the mouth as much as previous products. Hydrogenated oil permitted a finer grinding of peanuts, which prevented the salt  from separating from the peanut butter...Rosefield selected the name 'Skippy' for his new peanut butter. Most likely, the name was derived from a children's comic  strip also called 'Skippy...Rosefield introduced creamy and chunky-style peanut butter in 1932. Three years later, the company inaugurated its first wide-mouth  peanut-butter jar, which became the industry standard...Peanut butter was born at the end of the nineteenth century as a health and vegetarian food, but by the  1920s it was a major national product...In less than twenty-five years, peanut butter evolved from a hand ground delicacy to a mass-produced commercial  commodity sold in almost every grocery store in America. it was employed in virtually every type of food from soups, salads, sauces, and main courses to desserts  and snacks of every description. Peanut butter was versatile, inexpensive, available, and ready to use. Its makers appealed to children, who could make their own  sandwiches and other peanut butter treats.\"\n---Peanuts: The Illustrious History of the Goober Pea, Andrew F. Smith [University of Illinois Press:Urbana] 2002 (p. 42-44)\nElla Eaton Kellogg's recipe:\nPeanut Butter.--A nut butter mill is desirable for the preparation of nut butter at home. If one designed for the purpose is not obtainable, a coffee or hand wheat mill may be used. Blanch the nuts, but do not roast and grind. The meal thus prepared may be cooked by putting it (dry) in the inner cup of a double boiler and cooking as directed for grains, for eight or ten hours. As it is required for use, add water to make of the desired consistency, and cook again for a few minutes, just long enough to bring out the essential oil of the nuts. Water may be added as soon as the nuts are ground, and the mixture placed in a covered bean pot and baked from eight to ten hours in a moderate oven, if preferred.\"\n---Science in the Kitchen, Mrs. Ella Eaton Kellogg [Modern Medicine Publishing Co.:Battle Creek, MI] 1895  (p. 395)\nEarly promotional literature\n\"What is the element generally most lacking in the diet of children?

Recipes for Hamburg Steaks (aka hamburgers) were included in many popular American cookbooks. Cooks often added inexpensive fillers (bread crumbs, ketchup, tomato paste, eggs, sweet peppers, minced onions, Worcestershire sauce, bottled horseradish, pickle relish, mustard, salt & pepper were the most popular) to stretch the meat. This ground beef mixture was then fashioned into meatballs, meat loaves, hamburger stew,  and loose meat sandwiches.\nEarly 20th century American cookbooks offer plenty of sloppy-joe type recipes, though they go by different titles: Toasted Deviled Hamburgers, Good Housekeeping Cook Book, Katharine Fisher [1944] (p. 534); Chopped Meat Sandwiches, Young America's Cook Book, Home Institute of the New York Herald Tribune [1940] (p. 36); Hamburg a la Creole, Prudence Penny's Cookbook, [1939] (p.67); Beef Mironton, The New Butterick Cook Book, Flora Rose [1924] (p. 266); Minced Beef Spanish Syle, Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book, Sarah Tyson Rorer [1902] (p.157).\nWhere do sloppy joes fit in?\n\"The origins of this dish are unknown, but recipes for the dish date back at least to the 1940s. It dates in print to 1935. There is probably no Joe after whom it is named--but its rather messy appearance and tendency to drip off plate or roll makes \"sloppy\" an adequate description, and \"Joe\" is an American name of proletarian character and unassailable genuineness.

Vietnamese Banh Mi are current trend. These overstuffed meat, cheese and vegetable oblong-shaped foods nestled between thick Italian or chewy French bread were recipes built on local culinary traditions and ethnic preference. Six-foot sandwiches surface in New York City, circa 1950s.\nOld-world filled breads ( calzones, empanadas, pasties, &c. )  were introduced to America in the 19th century by immigrant laborers. The classic \"Sub\" (salami, cheese, peppers, olives, oil) was introduced to America by immigrants from Southern Italy in the early part of the 20th century. The progenitor of the sub was probably the muffolette . After World War II Italian food gained popularity with mainstream America. Over time, the sub assimilated. This accounts for the use of other meats (turkey, roast beef), cheese (American, Swiss), vegetables (lettuce, tomato) and spreads (mayonnaise, mustard).\n---\"The Noblest Sandwich of the All,\" Richard Gehman, Saturday Evening Post, January 1, 1955 (p. 16+)\n\"Pizzerias may have been among the first Italian-American eateries, but even at the turn of the century distinctions were clear-cut as to what constituted a true ristorante. To be merely a pizzamaker was to be at the bottom of the culinary and social scale; so many pizzeria owners began offering other dishes, including the 'hero' sandwich (also, depending on the region of the United States, called a 'wedge,' a 'hoagie,' a 'sub,' or a 'grinder') made on a Italian loaf of bread with lots of salami, cheese, and peppers.\"\n---America Eats Out, John Mariani [Morrow:New York] 1991 (p. 66)\n\"I happened to glance through a column that appeared in the New York Times [1957]...in which Manganaro's, the famed food establishment at 492 Ninth Avenue in Manhattan, staked a claim to the original hero.

What had originally been a \"grinder\" because of the way you had to chew to get  through the Italian bread became a \"sub\" during World War II.

A14)\n\"Settlers from Naples, Sicily, Calabria and Abruzzo poured into South Philadelphia in the 1880's and 1890's, and in the 1950's singers like Mario Lanza, Frankie  Avalon, Fabian and Bobby Rydell sprang from these hard streets...According to those who have explored the murky recesses of local food history, hoagies owe  their name to the Hog Island shipyard on the Delaware River. During  the Depression, or so the story goes, construction workers there used to buy Italian sandwiches from a luncheonette operated by one Al DePalma, who called  them ''hoggies.'' Time changed the name to hoagies. Hoagies are not fundamentally different from New York's heroes or Boston's grinders or Everytown's submarines. Call them what you like, but Philadelphia must  eat more per capita than anyplace else, and in a city where almost everybody, including Wawa convenience stores, fills eight-inch-long bread rolls with cold cuts,  South Philadelphia fills them better than anyone. The bread is the key to quality. So who better to make a great hoagie than a great bakery? That would be Sarcone's, a fixture on Ninth Street, which a few years  ago opened a tiny deli a few doors away. Its Old Fashioned Italian (Gourmet) hoagie is a minor masterpiece. A roll with a crunchy seeded crust and a soft, yet  densely chewy, interior provides a solid base with plenty of absorptive power. Both are sorely needed after they pile on the prosciutto, coppa, spicy sopressata,  provolone, oregano, tomatoes, onions, hot peppers, oil and vinegar.\"\n---\"In Hoagieland, They Accept No Substitutes,\" R.

The creation of that sandwich took place in tile Italian pushcart section of the city, known as Hog Island. Some  linguists contend that it was but a short leap from Hog Island to hoagie. while others claim that the label hoagie arose because only a hog had the appetite or  technique to eat one properly.\"\n---\"What Did You Say?,\" Richard Lederer, USA Today,  July 2009, (p. 52)\nThis oversized party food is attributed to the Manangaro family, whose Italian food shops were located at on Ninth Avenue, New York City.

The original sandwich cost $28.50, weighed between 22 & 25 pounds, served between 40-50 people, and was  presented on a board crafted for the purpose. Who was responsible for the invention? Therein lies the rub which caused a family feud of epic proportions. Two  brothers, Sal and Jimmy Dell'O'rto (direct descendants of the original Manganaro proprietor) claim the honor. Another story credits an unnamed publicist hired to  promote the family business.\n[1959]\n\"A Ninth Avenue sandwich shop is offering something different: a 25-pound 'Hero' sandwich six-feet long.

Not so the descendants of a 19th-century Neapolitan who opened an  Italian deli on Ninth Avenue 107 years ago. In high fairy-tale tradition, the business eventually passed to descendants: four brothers named Dell'Orto  who, citing difference in management style, divided it up between the oldest and youngest pairs. That was in 1961, and the family relations were never the same.  Salvatore and Vincent, the older brothers, took over the original store, Manganaro's Grosseria Italiano, a prosperous business that sold  groceries and had a small sandwich counter in the back. James and Mario, the younger brothers, got the business next door, a budding sandwich  shop called Manganaro's Hero Boy. Both businesses were given the right to use the Manganaro name, but relations between them quickly soured. By the early  1960s the two sides had stopped speaking, and since then a trail of litigation has kept the feud alive...The stores locked horns in  court in the 1980s, when Hero Boy sued the Grosseria for establishing a telephone line called 'Manangaro's Hero Party Hotline' that sold  six food and party hero sandwiches. 'By doing that, he bummed into my business,' said James, asserting that in the 1960's and 1970's  he spent considerable sums to promote his six-foot heroes, a sandwich he says Salvatore had hardly dabbled with until the 1980s.  But Salvatore strongly disagrees. In fact, he said, 'We originated the six-foot sandwich.'\"\n---\"Family Feud: Manganaro's Against Manganaro's,\" Tara Bahrampour, New York Times, May 14, 2000 (p. 34)\n\"The business itself originated in  1893 as Petrucci's Wines and Brandies, where groceries were sold as well. In the 1920's, James Manganaro, an immigrant from Naples, took it  over and gave it his name. He did so well that in 1927 he bought the building at 488 Ninth Avenue...In 1955, the six-foot hero was brainstormed when the  family and a publicity agent figured that a large hero sandwich would be a good marketing ploy. Dubbed Hero-Boy, the 22-pound  extravaganza cost $28.50 in the 1960s (it costs $106 now). Back then, it won such renown that Sal and the sandwich wound up on the  quiz show 'I've Got a Secret.' (They stumped the panel). In 1956, the family bought the vacant store next door, and sandwiches, including the  six-foot hero, were made there as well...It didn't take long for customers to become confused, placing an order with one Manganaro store,  confirming the order with another...How did the feud begin?

In 1956, with his mother Nina, James Dell'Orto operated the Italian Groceria known as Manganaro's. James decided to take this  one step further and got the brilliant idea of doing a hero sandwich that would be the first of its kind and called it the Six Foot Hero Boy.

Similar to a hero, they are a specialty of New Orleans, where they were originally called push sandwiches because the meat was pushed along the length of the bread to save the best parts for last. The  Po'boy was created in the 1920s by Benny and Clovis Martin, owners of Martin Brothers Grocery, who served the sandwich to striking streetcar workers free of charge (other sources say for fifteen cents) until the strike ended. They used up more than a thousand loaves of bread in one day. Another story says the term is related to the French for a gratuity, pourboire.

One is muffuletta, an Italian submarine-type sandwich with a distinctive olive salad. It was created at Central Grocery Store in the early 1900s and still is sold there. Marie Lupo Tusa, daughter of the grocery's founder, tells the story of the sandwich's origin in her cookbook, Marie's Melting Pot (1980). Sicilian farmers selling produce at the nearby Farmers' Market stopped at the grocery every day for lunch. \"They would order some salami, some ham, a piece of cheese, a little olive salad and either long braided Italian bread or round muffuletta bread,\" Tusa wrote. \"In typical Sicilian fashion they ate everything separately.\" Her father decided it would be easier for the farmers if he cut the bread and put everything on it like a sandwich. After experimenting, he determined that the softer muffuletta bread worked better than the crusty Italian loaves, Tusa says. Shortly, the farmers began asking simply for the \"muffuletta.\"\n--- http://www.dispatch.com/news/trips/taste/trad0707.html\nUSA-centric media concentrates on where to obtain this trendy menu item. They provide scant references to its origin, history and evolution. Our research confirms  \"banh\" is indeed a traditioal food of Vietnam. The origins are ancient and the \"true\" ingredients are indigenous. The Banh mi celebrated to day is a far cry from  Vietnam's street foods. Presumably, this hybrid product was either created from, or inspired by, French culinary influence. Many popular ethnic-based  Americanized foods were launched similar fashion. Think: spaghetti & meatballs and California rolls.\nNone of the articles we read provided a date/decade for the genesis of banh mi. The most daring authors alluded vaguely to the beginning of 18th century French  imperial rule. If we had to make an educated guess? We would place this food in the mid-20th century, most likely after WWII. American hero-type sandwiches  (Philly Cheese Steaks, New Orleans Po'Boys, etc.) wedged their way onto the American culinary map during 1930s.\nWhat is traditional Vietnamese banh?\n\"Banh is a word for which there is no satisfactory English equivalent. Spring rolls can be called banh, as can crepes. Sandwiches, and any baked goods are called  banh. Sweets and savouries wrapped in leaves to be steamed or grilled are called banh. The only constant is that banh are small culinary bundles or other  constructions, often eaten with the hands. Vietnamese who speak English generally refer to them as 'cake'...banh are quintessential street food. The oldest form of  banh...what is arguably the world's oldest form of cooking other than simply exposing meat to fire, are those wrapped in leaves. In every market, and on street  corners of every city and town, you will see them. Tightly wrapped in green leaves and tied with complex knots that would make a sailor proud, they fill baskets with  their abundance...Each region in Vietnam has its own banh, just as each region of France has its own wine. The various ethnig groups prepare different types of  banh with their local ingredients. People from the Tay ethnic minority wrap yams in banana leaves and call it banh khoai so. Hmong people use banana leaves to  wrap banh ngo non, or young corn banh. Sweet potatoes and cassava are other common ingredients in the highlands. Leaf-wrapped banh are popular and  enduring because they are so well suited to local materials and conditions. Leaves provide a container in which foods are cooked, and alos help to preserve the  food, and keep it from getting dirty or mouldy. It is so compact and portable that if you have banh, you've alsways got a moveable feast, with no worries about  disposing of a plastic wrapper. The most common ingredient in banh is rice both sticky and fluffy. A popular type is 'square cake', kwown in the north a banh  chung, a savoury sticky rice preparation filled with mung bean paste and minced pork, wrapped in banana leaves, or the leaves of rushes, and steamed. While these  can be found any day of the year, they are also important festival fare...In the central and southern parts of the country this cake is called banh u. The filling is the  same, but hte package is intricately folded into a little pyramid...Banh tet, sometimes called Banh day, is said to have been first prepared by votaries on the Hung  temple, near Hanoi. Thos is called the birthplace of the Vietnamese people, and its banh is meant to symbolise the continuity of the race, its determination to 'go  forth and multiply'. Banh tet is always filled with rice, the gastronomic symbol of fertility.\"\n---World Food: Vietnam, Richard Sterling, Lonely Planet (p. 181-182)\nFrench connection & American introduction\n\"The French left their Vietnamese colonies with a legion of trained baguette bakers, pate makers and charcutiers who added their own flavorings to sausages and  deli meats. This culinary legacy inspired Banh-mi, crunchy rolls piled with Vietnamese-style cold cuts. They are sold on practically every corner in Saigon, and now  scores of California shops specialize in them. One of my favorite versions is at My Vi, a fascinating place to while away a lunch hour. At one end of the restaurant,  people line up at a portable Chinese-style barbecue for take-out cha-shu and barbecued duck. At the other end, they eat \"French submarines.\" My choice was  Banh mi dia-a marvelous sandwich plate of assorted Vietnamese-style cold cuts and pate with two sunny-side-up eggs in the center. A little salad of marinated  carrots and fresh chile slices also comes on the plate alongside a huge fluffy mound of wonderful homemade mayonnaise.

F2)\nTrendy fare\n\"Operators across the country are exploring ways to upgrade the traditional American sandwich. But some are predicting that the next sandwich craze is waiting in  the wings in Vietnamese neighborhoods across the country. Banh mi sandwiches - a classic Vietnamese combination of p�t�, ham, sausages or head-cheese,  topped with pickled carrots, cucumbers, daikon, fresh cilantro and jalape�os on a French baguette - have been common in cities with large Asian populations for  the past two decades. But as more non-Asian diners discover the inexpensive and tasty treat, operators are seeing crossover potential to appeal to a broader  audience. Banh mi specifically was mentioned by a study released in April by Packaged Facts, a New York-based market research firm specializing in consumer  goods, as one of several Asian dishes with \"potential for mainstream appeal.\" According to Packaged Facts, the total U.S. retail sales of Asian foods increased by  27.3 percent from 2000 to 2004, driven in part by a growing Asian-American population. The sandwich is a classic example of cultural fusion, a vestige of the  French colonial era in Vietnam. The bread is French, of course, as is the smear of p�t�, ham and mayonnaise. The rest is Vietnamese, offering a refreshing spice and  crunch. A banh mi is essentially a submarine sandwich with an exotic twist. Some use Asian-style barbecued pork, lemongrass chicken and other hot options as  well, and most banh mi shops allow guests to customize their orders.\"\n---\"Banh mi on a roll,\" Lisa Jennings, Nation's Restaurant News, May 16, 2005 (p. 41)\n\"A baguette, still warm from the oven, its golden crust trellised with cracks. Sandwiched inside, a bright green thatch of cilantro and jalapenos, a tangle of pickled  carrots and daikon, a smear of pate. Loaded between that, maybe a layer of rich barbecued pork or zesty meatballs, even spicy sardines. This is banh mi, an  addictive Vietnamese street food and the culinary pay dirt of French colonialism.\"\n---\"COOKING; A slice of Little Saigon; The banh mi sandwich, a fresh baguette  with savory fillings, is the quintessential Vietnamese comfort food,\"  Amy Scattergood, Los Angeles Times, November 5, 2008 (p. F1)\n\"No one knows precisely when the first b�nh m� hit New York, although historians of that ingenious Vietnamese delicacy estimate that it was sometime during the  Koch administration [1978-1989], back when there wasn't such a huge market for crackly demi-baguettes, warmed in the oven, slicked with mayo and p�t�, then layered  meticulously with a variety of cold cuts and a thatch of pickled and fresh vegetables. One thing is certain: Since that fateful day, the b�nh m� (pronounced bun me)  has come into its own, transcending its humble Chinatown origins to infiltrate not only hipster enclaves like Williamsburg, which, in the two years since Silent H  opened, has become a b�nh m� hub, but also the menus of cocktail lounges (Pegu Club, which serves a fried-oyster b�nh m�), coffee shops (Roots & Vines,  where you can have a b�nh m� with your Counter Culture latte), and even wine bars (Terroir offers a mortadella-stuffed b�nh m�Italiano). It's fair to say, in fact,  that the b�nh m� is the new panino, and the toaster oven (found wherever b�nh m� are made, including a new financial-district street cart) the new panini press.\"\n---\"Another B�nh M� in the Oven; Is the humble Vietnamese hoagie poised to become New York's No. 1 sandwich?,\" Robin Raisfeld, Rob Patronite, New  York Magazine, April 13, 2009\n\"In Vietnamese, the word banh mi means \"bread,\" and the sandwich itself is a culinary testament to the influence of French colonialism, which began in the mid- 1800s. During this time, baguettes, along with cream, butter, pte, custards and coffee were introduced to the country, and over the years, consequently morphed  into the many French-influenced Vietnamese dishes we know today. Classic French-style crepes became Ban xeo, a rice flour/coconut crepe filled with pork,  shrimp and bean sprouts, while a classic French asparagus veloute (a stock-enriched cream-based soup) gets a Vietnamese makeover with the addition of  crabmeat, dried shrimp and fish sauce. There are many banh mi variations and options, whether you're taking on the challenge of re-creating one of these  sandwiches at home or ordering from a local Vietnamese bakery. In addition to the more common filling of pork or sliced pate, sandwiches can be stuffed with  grilled chicken, sardines, even head cheese. When ordering one of these baguettes at a Vietnamese bakery, never fear. Most establishments make life easy by  listing each sandwich variation in English and Vietnamese along with a larger- than-life-photo to help you through the process. And the price cannot be beat. For a  12-inch sandwich, you'll get set back $3, and many bakeries have a promotion of buy five, get one free to sweeten the deal that much more.\"\n---\"A Vietnam tradition: the banh mi sandwich,\" Kendra Bailey Morris, The Richmond Times-Dispatch, November 22, 2009 (p.

Our survey of historic American newspapers suggest Tortilla Pinwheel sandwiches surfaced in 1987. The fact that tortilla pinwheels were introduced about the same time as New Southwestern Cuisine appears to be a  parallel gastronomic coincidence. The earliest recipes in Amerian print call for cream cheese, ham, Dijon mustard, and dill.  A far cry from TexMex. Even more intriguing? The first recipe we found actually called for lahvosh (lavash), a traditional Armenian flatbread.  About lavosh .\nWere these sandwiches Armenian fare? It appears so! The pinwheel presentation, like the use of  tortillas, appears to be an Armenian-American adapation.\n\"Eating food folded in lavash is an Armenian obsession. A wrap made by spreading a filling on lavash and rolling it tightly  is called brdooch in the vernacular of an Armenian village. The most common filling for brdooch is salty cheese and herbs.  Brdooch was a popular fast food and a basic meal for many generations of Armenian peasants and townsfolk...And the time came when  the grandchildren of brdooch-loving Armenians landed in the United States. It's no big surprise that they turned brdooch into an  American fast food. Armenian-American food entrepreneurs modified those original small lunches...giving them names like 'Hye Roll'  (hye means Armenian), 'Hye Wraps,' and 'Aram Sandwich.' Just as the basis of Mexican food is the tortilla, the foundation of the Armenian brdoock and its modern variations is lavash. The  authentic new way of eating a real brdooch is to make a long, pipe-like wrap, hold it with two hands and bite, starting from  the top.\"\n---Armenian Food: Fact, Fiction & Folklore, Irina Petrosian and David Underwood [Yerkir Publishing:Bloomington IN] 2006  (p. 30-31)\nThe first print evidence we find for making pinwheel sandwiches with tortillas is a recipe for \"Ham and Cheese Lahvosh  Rolls\" makes no references to origin, ethnic tradition, \"inventor\" or company promotion.\n\"For a light lunch or substantial snack, ham and cheese lahvosh rolls are sure to satisfy any appetite.

H34)\nAlthough hot sandwich-type combinations of bread, cheese, meat, and condiments were known to ancient cooks, tuna fish sandwiches are generally considered a 20th century recipe. The canned tuna industry was launched in 1903 and food companies played an active role in promoting their products to the American public. Many companies authored cookbooks and recipe brochures to show housewives how to use their product. Tuna fit neatly into the sandwich market, where diced lobster, crab and salmon mixed with dressings were already in vogue.\nRecipes for tuna sandwiches (mostly cold tuna salad) begin to show up regularly in American cookbooks published in  the 1920s. These books also contain several recipes for toasted/broiled cheese and meat combinations, though none with tuna. The only hot fish sandwich recipes we find in the 1920s and 1930s are for sardines, without cheese. It is not until after World War II we begin to find recipes for toasted tuna and cheese combinations (either open or closed, broiled or sauteed). They were not called cheese melts but they would have produced a similar product. Consider:\n1946: \"Tuna Fish Sandwiches with Cheese,\" Joy of Cooking, Irma Rombauer (p. 30)\n---broiled, open with tomatoes & grated cheese (no type specified)\n1954: \"Tuna buns,\" Start to Finish, Ann Batchelder (p. 70) [food editor of the Ladies Home Journal]\n---baked, open on hamburger buns, cheddar cheese, gherkins\n1972: \"Tuna Cheesewiches & Broiled Tuna Burgers\" Del Monte Kitchens Cook Book (p. M-3)\n---baked, closed in foil-wrapped hamburger buns, swiss cheese & ketchup\n---broiled, hamburger buns, cheddar cheese\nSo, when did the name \"tuna melt\" begin? Jean Anderson, food historian and cook book author, offers this explanation:\n\"Who came up with this broiled, cheese-topped open-face tuna salad sandwich? And when? The first recipe I could find for anything simliar appears in Ida Baily Allen's Best Loved Recipes of the American People (1973). \"Tuna-Cheese Grilled Open Sandwich,\" she calls it. The catch here is that Ida Baily Allen died in 1973. Best Loved Recipes is clearly a compilation of recipes gathered throughout her long career, which began early in the twentieth century. There are no dates on any of the recipes, or for that matter, any historical notes. My good friend cook book author Sandy Gluck thinks Tuna Melt is a  60s or  70s creation and that the creator may have been a dormitory coed with a toaster-oven. Sandy says the first time she was asked to make a Tuna Melt was in the early 1980s when she was the chef at a restaurant in New York's Chelsea district. Tuna Melt recipes differ from cook to cook because tuna salad recipes, themselves, vary.\"\n---The American Century Cookbook: The Most Popular Recipes of the 20th Century, Jean Anderson [Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997 (p. 344)\nThe earliest print references we find for \"Tuna Melt\" are ads publsihed by popular family restaurant chains circa 1975:\n\"Tuna Melt Banquet.

It is served hot on toast or rolls.\nAmericans did not invent the Western Sandwich. Combinations of eggs, meat and spices were enjoyed by ancient people, and evolved in many different cultures and cuisines. Our notes on the history of omelets & scrambled eggs . These recipes arrived on our shores with colonial settlers and immigrant cooks. 17th-19th century English and American cookbooks have plenty of ham and egg recipes which confirm the popularity of this particular combination. Eggs on Toast , Frizzled Ham and Eggs, and other popular recipes from Estelle Woods Wilcox's Buckeye Cookery, [Minneapolis] 1877.\nWho came up with the idea?\nThere are three primary theories regarding the origin of this sandwich in the USA. All are plausible.  One camp credits 19th century Chinese cooks working on the western railroads. Like chop suey , some traditional Chinese recipes adapted well to American ingredients. Another other camp attributes this sandwich to Anglo-American food culture. And then? There's Basque piperade .\nWhile Chinese cookbooks offer several recipes centering on eggs (omelets, etc.), Egg Fu Yung appears to be a Chinese-American hybrid based on the non-Chinese ingredients. Modernized recipes (20th century forward) are  plentiful; some include standard Chinese vegetables & meat/fish products.\n\"Other Chinese were cooks for the work gangs, and one of these, I am willing to believe, invented the sandwich that is called a \"western\" in the states east of the Mississippi and a \"Denver\" in most of the rest of the country. When a hungry cowboy asked for a sandwich between meals, the story goes, the Chinese cook prepared eggs foo yung by making the traditional Oriental omelet from meats and vegetables at had--in this case the green pepper that was grown by early Spanish in the West, along with onions and some chopped ham. Put between slices of bread, this hasty Chinese creation became the prototype of one of the most American of all sandwiches.\"\n---American Food: The Gastronomic Story, Evan Jones, 2nd edition [Vintage:New York] 1981 (p. 166)\n\"Foo Yung Eggs, Foo Yung Daan. The Egg Foo Yung that is so popular in Chinese-American (as distinct from Chinese) restaurants deserves an honored place in your repertoire. This type of omelet, together with Chop Suey and Chow Mein, which were invented in America, serves to bridge the gulf between Western and Chinese tastes. In recent years, Egg Foo Yung has fallen in the esteem of those who have become knowledgeable about Chinese food, perhaps because of its past associations. However, any dish is only as good as the ingredients used and the skill of the cook. When properly made, I think this dish is delectable. Egg Foo Yung is not strictly a dish invented for the American taste by Chinese cooks. There was a great tradition from which it drew.\"\n---Jim Lee's Chinese Cook Book, [Harper & Row:New York] 1968 (p. 98-9)\nAs is common with many popular foods, the recipe precedes the name. And! The recipe has more than one name.\n\"Western sandwich. The American Heritage Cookbook and Illustrated History of American Eating and Drinking (1964) fixed the origin of this sandwich in Westward Ho days when pioneer women masked the flavor of over-the-hill eggs by mixing them in plenty of onions. Of course those frontier women lacked some of the principal ingredients of the classic Western Sandwich--green and/or red bell peppers. Other food historians believe the sandwich may have originated with chuckwagon cooks, then been refined and embellished over the years. Whatever its origins, the Western Sandwich seems not to have made it into the pages of cookbooks--or onto the menus of restaurants--until well into the twentieth century. In the West, it's often called a \"Denver.\"\n---The American Century Cookbook: The Most Popular Recipes of the 20th Century, Jean Anderson [Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997 (p. 349)\n\"The Western Sandwich was invented by pioneers. It was common for eggs to get \"high\" after a long haul over hot trails. In order to salvage the eggs, and kill the bad flavor of them, pioneers women mixed eggs with onions and any other seasonings on hand.\n1/4 pound ham or 4 slices bacon, diced\n1 green pepper, chopped\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nVery old English favourite: Recipe for first iced chocolate ... great grandfather of John Montagu, 4th Earl, credited with inventing ...

Secondly, there seems to be a long term interest in bringing chocolate to England commercially. \n'Sandwich also sits on a committee looking at how to improve trade with newly colonised areas in South and Central America.\n'Lastly, the Earl of Sandwich was a member of the Royal Society and they were interested in freezing and ice, this was at the time when Robert Boyle was doing a lot of work on how to freeze things.'\nEven if the technology was yet to catch up, chocolate was till a novelty item and only just ticking the nation's taste buds in the 1600s.\nDr Loveman explained: 'Chocolate was first advertised in England around 1640 as an exotic drink made from cacao beans. In the 1660s, when the Earl of Sandwich collected his recipes, chocolate often came with advice about safe consumption. \nThe recipe was found in a pamphlet my Sir Edward Montagu, the 2nd Earl of Sandwich\n'One physician cautioned that the ingredients in hot chocolate could cause insomnia, excess mucus, or haemorrhoids. People worried that iced chocolate in particular was 'unwholesome' and could damage the stomach, heart, and lungs.\n'There were ways round this, however. Sandwich thought the best way to ward off the dangers of eating frozen chocolate was to 'Drinke Hott chocolatti of an houre after' it. In other words, chocoholics are not new.'\nThe discovery was made during a search of a journal kept by Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Sandwich, by Leicester University historian, Dr Kate Loveman.\nAltogether seven recipes were found, including one acquired by the Earl from King Charles II for enhancing chocolate with extravagant ingredients including whale vomit, known as ambergris, musk and civet, a substance extracted from the glands of a civet cat. \nThe recipe has a £200 cost written on it - a staggering amount for the time - but it is not known whether this was the price paid for the recipe or the cost of the ingredients.\nDr Loveman said: 'Charles II's recipe involved mixing 3lbs of cocoa nuts, oil of Jamaica, oil of aniseed, oil of cinnamon, cardamom and Guinea pepper to make what they call a leaven cake, although it's nothing like what we would consider a leaven cake today.\n'Then to make the chocolate he says you should mix more cocoa nuts, vanilla and sugar, which could be perfumed with musk, ambergris and civet.\n'It's unclear if Sandwich paid £200 for the recipe itself or just for the ingredients, but to put it in perspective if you are a housemaid in the Earl's house you would make £4 a year.'\nThe thick mixture would usually be watered down before it was drunk, or it may have been mixed in a way similar to the Earl's own recipe. \nSix of the other recipes recorded by the Earl were drawn from his connections on the continent, where drinking chocolate was pioneered by the Spanish.\nChanges: The chocolate is very different from the sweet, milky form we eat now\nDr Loveland said: 'Sandwich used a book called A Curious Treatise on the Nature and Quality of Chocolate by a Spanish Doctor called Antonio Colmenero, which had been translated into French, for some of the recipes.\n'The others came from one of his subordinates in Spain called John Warden, who sent information from Madrid on frozen chocolate technology, including a recipe for frozen chocolate froth.'\nDr Loveland recreated the Earl's own recipe, which resembled a thicker version of the iced coffee drinks available at high street coffee shops today.\nThe Earl's recipe read: 'Prepare the chocolatti [to make a drink]... and Then Putt the vessell that hath the Chocolatti in it, into a Jaraffa [i.e. a carafe] of snow stirred together with some salt, & shaike the snow together sometyme & it will putt the Chocolatti into tender Curdled Ice & soe eate it with spoons.'\nHis journal was written after he found his love for chocolate while ambassador extraordinary to Spain in the 1660s.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nTitle: TEL_11222014, Author: Shaw Media, Name: tel_11222014, Length: 40 pages, Published: 2014-11-22T00:00:00.000Z . issuu company logo Explore Publish ...

I apologize because it’s not easy being a journalist, from many standpoints. At the top of my list? The pay isn’t great. The hours are often crazy. You’re going to meet people who don’t like you, just because you’re the media. But really, I should be saying congratulations. Why, you ask? The earto-ear smile that spread across Kenzie Renkes’ face can answer that. The 15-year-old Morrison freshman job-shadowed me Monday night, and we began by filling out a sheet of questions required by her class. The last one read, “What’s the best advice you can give to someone who’s thinking about going into your line of work?” That was the easiest question I fielded. “You’d better love it,” I said. “I like that answer,” she said, her eyes gleaming and that huge smile stretching from lobe to lobe. There was an unspoken understanding that I love my job. And going to work every day and doing what you love is the sort of pro that brushes any cons to the wayside. Kenzie is already knocking out a lot of communications classes that will help her to decide whether she wants to follow her passion. She loves creative writing. A Harry Potter buff, she writes a lot of nonfiction in her spare time. But writing is also a coping mechanism for her. “When people get me frustrated, I write,” she said. And that’s not resorting to subtweeting or cryptically belly-aching about people on Facebook.

She sat in on our Monday reporters’ meeting, hung out with cops-and-courts reporter Christi Warren, and got a look at the War and Peace-like document the IDOC released Monday. Kenzie had a handful of questions while I laid out the news budget, copy-edited stories for the Tuesday edition, and, eventually, designed the cover of the paper. As some of my answers to her questions fleshed out responses I gave for the questionnaire, she’d grab the sheet and tack on more notes. She’ll make a wonderful interviewer. She made sure to maintain eye contact as she scribbled many of my answers. The girl oozes with journalistic instincts. And she has a pioneering spirit, which Warren prodded during our meeting, when Kenzie revealed there’s no student newspaper at Morrison High. “You need to start one,” Warren said. “All you need is you and three people to boss around.” “I want to. I’m going to,” Kenzie replied. Kenzie greeted just about everyone I introduced her to with something to the effect of, “Thanks so much for having me here. This is such a great experience.” Everyone’s eyes lit up when they saw how much she enjoyed a peek into our wacky world. It was glaring that news editor Kathleen A. Schultz enjoyed having some young blood in the room, as she gave her a business card. “Send me some of your writing.

Honestly, Kenzie’s visit made my week, and it affirmed the excitement I felt when Katy asked last week whether Kenzie could job-shadow. I’ll always leap at the opportunity to give youngsters a look behind the curtain at what we do. Because the incoming generation is going to be crucial for us to keep doing it. Which brings us to another one of her questions: What’s your least favorite part of the job? I thought long and hard. Not because I didn’t know the answer. I didn’t know whether I wanted to scare her. But why lie, right? She was there for an honest look at our world. “Always being asked to do more with less,” I said. But who isn’t? Maybe the better way to put it is, which successful, profitable company isn’t? We’ve been asked to take on a lot this year. And we’ve adapted to the changing technological landscape, which is where journalistic prodigies like Kenzie could be paramount.

He was born Sept. 5, 1923, in Sherburn, Minnesota, the son of Leo Bernard and Mabel Margaret (Faivre) Terveer. Clete was a veteran of World War II, having served in the Navy with rank of motor machinist mate second class. He married Marian Claussen on March 4, 1946, in Sherburn, Minnesota. She died Sept. 10, 1993. He married Carolyn (Savage) Hayes on July 3, 1995. She died Feb. 15, 2009. In 1957, he moved his family to Rock Falls, where he took a job as custodian at the newly built St. Andrew Grade School and church. His career there spanned more than 32 years, having encountered several generations of students during that 3 decades of service. During that time period, his role was more than just custodian, as he was also called upon to fix, repair, and maintain just about everything, inside and outside of the building. He also started working for Art Selmi shortly after he came to Illinois, and continued for more than 50 years, part-time for Frank Selmi in recent years. Following retirement, Clete continued to work, doing odd jobs, mowing, and snow removal for many clients until this past summer when he became ill. He was a member of St. Andrew Catholic Church in Rock Falls, serving as an usher for many years. He was a member of the Catholic Order of Forresters and of Knights of Columbus Council 11874. He also was a fourth-degree member of Assembly 1702, and a member of Rock Falls American Legion Post 902 and Rock Falls Veterans of Foreign Wars. He enjoyed attending his children and grandchildren’s sporting and family events.\nSurviving are four daughters, Annette (Tim) Manning, Karen (Darryl) Elgin, Betty Denger, and Patricia (Clifford) Sexton; three sons, Mark (Gail) Terveer, Michael (Jenny) Terveer, and Bruce (Jennie) Terveer; three stepdaughters, Mary Christine Swanson, Teresa Snow, and Cynthia (Jim) Chatham; eight sisters, Veronica Studer, Zita Reetz, Barbara Schanz, Janet (Steve) Roth, Gloria (Art) Bauer, Vernetta Cellette, Clarina Miller, and Clarita (Jim) Denny; three brothers, Alois (Fran) Terveer, Vitus Terveer, and David (Linda) Terveer; 16 grandchildren, Andy (Jenny) Terveer, Amy (Bryan) Chastain, Abby (Chad) Wink, Kim (John) Wichelmann, Dan (Joel) Terveer, Katie (Marc) Brown, Nicole (Kyle) Gilkeson, Ron (Kortney) Manning, Andrea (Aaron) Butikofer, Amanda (Chad) Denger, Kaylee (Ryan) Baumer, Matt (Alicia) Sexton, Josh (Chaley) Sexton, Lucas Terveer, Nathan Terveer, and Jacob Terveer; 22 great-grandchildren; one great-great-grandchild; five stepgrandchildren; three step-greatgrandchildren, and special friend, Maxine Bartz.

Desvignes Sr.\nJean C. Larson COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado – Jean Carolyn Larson, 64, of Colorado Springs, formerly of Sterling, passed away Friday, Oct. 17, 2014, in Colorado Springs. She was a teacher with Sterling Public Schools for 33 years. Jean was born Feb. 3, 1950, in Chicago, the daughter of Charles and Ruth Bonifield. She lived in Chicago as a child before moving to Pinckneyville in the eighth grade. She moved to Barry for her senior year of high school, graduating as valedictorian. Jean attended college at Western Illinois University, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in education in 1971. She earned a Master of Science degree in education in 1986 from Northern Illinois University, and a general administrative license in 1998. She began her teaching career in 1972, with Sterling Public Schools as an elementary teacher at Washington Elementary School. She was a second-grade teacher for many years. She also was a Chapter One coordinator, a Title One/bilingual coordinator, a student services coordinator, and a reading specialist within the school district until her retirement in 2005. Jean married Stephen W. Larson on Jan. 1, 1989, in Cypress Gardens, Florida. Together, they enjoyed designing\nand building their family’s home and spending time at their property on the Mississippi River. He preceded her in death on May 16, 2000. Jean was committed to her faith and was a member of Abiding Word Church in Sterling. She delighted in children’s literature and passed her love of reading to her children and grandchildren. She enjoyed being outdoors on a warm day tending her flower gardens. She always maintained a positive disposition despite the many challenges of Parkinson’s disease. She is survived by one daughter, Suzanne Shuda of Colorado Springs, Colorado; one son, Stephen A. Shuda Jr. of Wheeling, West Virginia; one brother, Dennis Bonifield, of Barry; two stepsons, Brett and Jeremy Larson of Colorado; and nine grandchildren.

The Peoria Avenue bridge will be open\nfor southbound traffic detoured to Hennepin or Galena avenues during these closures. Here is a summary of other work planned for the streetscape project next week, according to project engineers: • Work will continue on the parking lot at First Street and Peoria Avenue, and the lot will remain closed until work is finished. The parking lot, off Highland Avenue, behind the Telegraph office will remain open for public parking during the streetscape work.\nMystery tours prove to be niche for region TOURISM\nCONTINUED FROM A1\n“We can moan and groan that we don’t have a Branson, [but] we have a lot to offer within our four counties,” Bausman said. In July, Gov. Pat Quinn said Illinois had its third consecutive recordbreaking year for tourism, and Bausman uses her ability to connect with people and her negotiating prowess to grab some of that attention. “Day trips are huge,” she said, noting that about 96 percent of the website traffic comes from the Chicago area. A former real estate broker, Bausman adjusted the organization’s focus to promote what the Sauk Valley already has, and takes every opportunity to highlight the positive aspects of country and rural living. “How do you tell people about our charming small towns?” she asked. While we might not feel the heat of the spotlight like Napa Valley or Orlando, Blackhawk Waterways is on a mission to make it easier to identify this region, and that’s translated to the group’s overall face and presentation. “If you’re Key West, or you’re ... Colorado, then you have skiing,” Bausman said, “but for us, it’s a little bit harder.” In the summer, rivers and lakes are filled with people participating in water sports, while parks are packed and barbecues lit. But during winter, all of that activity quiets down. In fact, some of the area’s major attractions, such as the John Deere historic site and Ronald Reagan boyhood home, are closed for the winter, so promotions turn to community events and festivals with live music. Those are a big hit, Bausman said. Blackhawk Waterways also has found a niche for the area as a mystery tour destination. A tour planner sells a vacation, but details of what travelers are doing or where they’re going aren’t revealed until they arrive, Bausman said. “[Canadians] love it,” she said of the group that represents the largest spike in foreign travelers to the area. A driving force behind Blackhawk Waterways is economic impact,\n• Sidewalk and electrical work will continue on Peoria Avenue between River and First streets. • The street lights to the east of Hennepin Avenue should be finished by this weekend or early next week.\nFREE HOPPER UPGRADE!

Additionally, installation of benches, trash cans, brick pavers and landscape blocks will continue.\nand while it’s difficult to quantify a return on investment, some indirect measures show how well it’s doing. For example, a group of 45 people from Indiana recently came through the area. In the mix were costs of admission, overnight expenses, food, and other fees that led to a minimum of $8,000 spent, Bausman said. The state also keeps track of cash flow throughout the Sauk Valley, although it doesn’t push benchmarks or milestones, Bausman said. Blackhawk Waterways is a nonprofit agency that gets money as a result of a formula that takes into account several variables, such as population and tax rate. And while the math can get a bit convoluted, Bausman said, the foundation of the funding comes from local and state hotel/ motel taxes that are matched by the state. If you stayed overnight in Savanna, for example, you’d pay the local hotel/motel tax in addition to the Carroll County tax, and a portion of that money would go to Blackhawk Waterways. The organization also keeps track of eight different taxing bodies. “With the new hotel coming along to the [Rock Falls] riverfront, … that’s going to be fantastic,” she said. The group takes that money and uses it to promote the local tourism groups “to outside a 50-mile radius.” Illinois figures that if you live within that radius, it’s likely you won’t stay overnight, Bausman said. Bausman makes the whole ship run on a budget of about $250,000 and a staff of two, including her. By comparison, it’s possible for a larger bureau such as Galena to have a multimillion-dollar operating budget, she said. In her 10 years as executive director, she has seen a wave of change from print-heavy advertising to a leaner digital approach, and attributes that trend to millennials. “I am a big believer in the R.O.A.D. philosophy – rip off and duplicate,” she quipped. And she always keeps an open mind to new marketing ideas, even while on vacation. “The good news,” she said, “is that our downtowns are really coming back.”\nIN BRIEF Arsenal lost 1,083 jobs in 2 years ROCK ISLAND (AP) – More than 1,000 jobs at the Rock Island Arsenal have been lost over the past 2 years due to cutbacks in defense\nMOVING?\nGet FREE truck rental rate quotes at Prescott Inc.\nDIXON STREETSCAPE\nSTAFF REPORT news@saukvalley.com 800-798-4085, ext. 5501\nSaturday, November 22, 2014\nspending.

Police said they arrested Michael V. Galindo, 27, in the 500 block of Fourth Avenue in Sterling on Wednesday when he took delivery of about 5 pounds of marijuana.\nService...\nBecause of its quality, that is worth about $60,000 on the street, Sterling Police Sgt.

Police declined to pro-\nvide further details about the tip or the arrest. Galindo is charged with unlawful possession of marijuana (2,000-5,000 grams) and unlawful possession of marijuana (2,000-5,000 grams) with the intent to deliver. He faces 3 to 15 years in prison if convicted. This is his first felony charge in Whiteside County. He was being held in the Whiteside County Jail.\nMerlin’s Greenhouse & “The Other Side” Join us for Oregon’s 28 th Annual\nCandlelight Walk!\nAlex T.

We encourage the board to make a still wiser choice by scheduling all its meetings at night. The advantages of night meetings are twofold. First, night meetings are easier for the working public to attend, if they so choose. Second, having night meetings allows board membership to draw from a wider pool of talent.\nSeveral board members, among them Greg Witzleb, Ryan Marshall, Kasey Considine and Allyn Buhrow, made those arguments. They are absolutely correct. The board will continue its tradition of meeting monthly at 9 a.m. on the third Tuesday from October through March. It voted to move its April through September meetings to 6 p.m. the third Tuesday. The 9 a.m. starting times are a nod toward cold weather, shorter days, and potential\nWhat we think\ncases of Whiteside, Ogle and Bureau counties, the people’s ease of attendThe Lee County Board has dipped its toe into the waters of greater public accessibility ing the meetings of their county board trumps that by scheduling half its 2015 meetings at of paid employees.

Ogle County deals with the issue by scheduling them all on one day, one week before the main board meeting, which begins at 5:30 p.m. Presumably, committee members break away from their normal daily routines to sit in on those meetings. The Lee County Board would be doing itself a service, as well as the public, by meeting at a more favorable time year-round. We believe nighttime is the right time for those monthly meetings.\nTHE READER’S VOICE\nTroubled by anonymity of sales tax flier PENNIE VON BERGEN WESSELS Rock Falls\nA plurality of readers answering SVM’s online poll said the election result that surprised them the most was the passage of the 1-cent sales tax increase (14.8 percent increase over current sales tax rates). Going from a losing 42.4 percent to a winning 51.1 percent in a handful of months is, indeed, astounding. One has to wonder whether the slick, jumbo postcard that arrived in our mailboxes the Friday before the election had anything to do with the result. In politics, such fliers are called an “11th-hour hit piece” because there is no time left before the election to address false statements in them. The “1% Makes Sense” red, black, and white flier promised “Your property taxes will decrease,” underlined and capitalized. The pro-sales tax piece even promised that your property taxes\nwould decrease by $150 on an average home. But the County School Facilities Tax (CSFT) law does not require that property taxes be reduced because of the additional sales tax money. There is no guarantee; in fact, the only school district in Whiteside County, to my knowledge, that actually passed a non-binding resolution to abate a specific amount of taxes with the extra money is Rock Falls Elementary. When Champaign County passed the CSFT, similar promises of property tax relief were made. Five years later, only one of its 13 districts reduced property tax levies; all the rest raised them. (See Illinois Policy Institute, “Champaign County Breaks Promise on Sales Tax Hike.”) Just who sent the anonymous flier to our mailboxes? Who paid for the design, printing, and postage? Who do we hold accountable in 2016, ’17, ’18, if our property taxes don’t go down the promised $150? Who felt the need to hide behind anonymity when making promises of property tax relief?\nWhat do you think? Do you agree with these letters? Do you disagree with these letters? Let us know.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and the Democratic Party surrendered without a fight. We have to look at what the GOP did “right,” and\nwhat the Democrats did “‘wrong” when analyzing the 2014 mid-term elections. Focusing on one or the other won’t accomplish a gosh-darn thing. The GOP ran on hate. That was their selling point, their party platform. They will deny it, of course, but who cares. What did the Democratic National Committee run on? The Democrats had a message, a bad one: “We’re not all like Obama.” That is (patheti-\ncally) what they ran on, that was their message. Therein lies the problem. There are enough Americans who hate President Obama to vote GOP and win. There were not enough Americans who were simply upset with Obama to vote for Dems. There was no political platform. Economics? Zilch. Trade? Zilch. War and peace? Zilch. Both parties ran simply to counter the other – “Vote for us. We’re not them.” And\nthat was enough for the GOP. It wasn’t enough for Democrats. Democrats are tired of GOP-lite. Democrats are tired of voting for change, and getting nothing in return for the trouble, other than a kinder, gentler, more inclusive brand of Wall Street fascism. Enough. We can be the left edge of the rightist reaction and fail, fail, fail, or we can stand up to the right and stop promoting global trade pacts that immiserate workers everywhere. We can fight for Medicare and face the global warming challenges. We can fight, fight, fight to end the scourge of inequality that has made America the increasingly sorry place it is today. It’s an easy choice and a winning choice. But it’s fail or fight. There’s no middle path.\nBEHIND THE READER’S VOICE | TONY VALENTINO Note to readers: This is another in a series of question-and-answer features about people who frequently write letters to the editor.

After that, I always warned my wife when I wrote a letter. Which other letter writers do you enjoy reading? I enjoy the writings of anyone who takes the time to express their\npoint of view. They all have value. Tell us a little about yourself: I guess I am considered older, but I do not feel that way. My wife and I were married for 46 years. She passed away 2 years ago, and I still struggle with that on a daily basis. I always went to Jesuit schools. They are, without exception, the best educators in the world. In 1991, my wife and I purchased Boston Leather. We manufacture leather accessories, initially for law enforcement and fire personnel. We do considerably more than that now. We have grown from four employees to 46. In 1999 we moved to Sterling, and that could not have been a better move. We have a great work force, and I love what I do. How would you describe yourself?

Favorite saying: Time is fleeting. Best advice anyone ever gave you: Two things. The first is: “Treat everyone with respect and dignity.

This will give you a command of the language that you would otherwise not be exposed to.” Your advice for local, state, and/or national government, in a nutshell: Listen to your constituents and, above all, be honest.

That was when newspapers, such as his Washington Post, were challenged only by network news broadcasts. Cable TV was in its infancy as a news provider, and the Internet was a decade away from expanding the amount of accessible information in totally mindblowing multiples. That’s when everybody became a news editor, each with a personal definition of what news is. We knew we were out of luck the day the word “news” died. NEWSPAPER EDITORS once were gatekeepers of information. That’s what Bradlee was describing. When most people got most of their news and information from newspapers, the job of editors was to wade through the numerous news reports, discard the junk, and print what was relevant and reliable – based on their experience with what their readers wanted and needed. But today, people can sort through those same reports – if they have\ntime – and edit information for themselves. Of course, most people don’t have the time to do that, so they tend to rely on a narrow band of information sources that tell them what they want to hear – not necessarily what they need. When it comes to food and information, you are what you consume. And something touched us deep inside the day the word “news” died. SO EVERYBODY NOW has a personal information outlet or two on cable TV and limitless sources on the Internet to feed their desires for news. They tell us, with no hint of doubt, that our beliefs are correct and our biases are justified. That must mean the people who disagree with us are wrong ... and maybe worse. Case closed. Do you recall what was revealed the day the word “news” died? BECAUSE NEWSPAPER readers are a diverse bunch, this editor hears regularly that his publication is too liberal or too conservative, too Republican or too Democratic, too this or too that. That’s life in the news business.\nlarryLOUGH Larry Lough is executive editor of Sauk Valley Media. Contact him via email at llough@ saukvalley. com.\nAnd if you take one editorial, one editorial cartoon, one editorial decision, or one line from a long column, you can support just about any argument for bias you wish to make. Too many people don’t have time for context. We saw Satan laughing with delight the day the word “news” died. RECENT EMAILS FROM a regular reader questioned this newspaper’s news judgment. He wondered why we had not printed information about the MIT professor who had suggested that passage of the Affordable Care Act, for which he was a consultant, was not done in a transparent manner in an effort to keep the public from knowing what was in the law. “Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,” Jonathan Gruber said at an academic conference. “And basically,\nTHE READER’S VOICE\nSilent majority needs to stop being silent NORALEE GRAY Polo\nI applaud the courage shown by Jane Anderson on her SV Weekend letter on Nov. 15 titled “Marriage is God’s creation, not humanity’s.” The only thing I would like to add to Jane’s biblical quotes is the sad fact that there are many in our country who are trying, and unfortunately succeeding, to have God removed from so many aspects of our life. I hope\nand pray that Jane and I are only a part of the “silent majority” who believe in the importance of God in our lives. Considering the direction our country is going, that’s more important now than ever. It’s time the silent majority stops being silent – before it’s too late.\nSterling should clarify the law on ATV usage KURT SCHWAB Sterling\nThe city of Sterling needs to look at an ordi-\nnance regarding ATVs – at least make the ordinance to where work can be performed in the city limits with an ATV. Jobs would include mowing, snow plowing, gardening, and other yard work. As the state statue says, they should be able to be driven on the roadway under 35 miles an hour. The order should also state that they should not be driven in any manner that is considered reckless. At this time, officers and residents are both up in arms as to what you can do and cannot do on an ATV within city limits.\ncall it ‘the stupidity of the American voter’ or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.” The media that cater to the political right seemed to think that was really big news. “Where is all the news coverage on the [Gruber] tapes where he admits they lied whenever they needed to in order to pass Obamacare?” the disappointed reader said in his email to the editor. “... Nothing about it in the [mainstream] media?” Not much. WHILE THE READER’S summary is a loose interpretation of what Gruber actually said, we’re pretty sure that’s what the reader has heard from his trusted news sources. After all, Fox News personalities described Gruber as the “architect” of Obamacare. “He wrote it,” one suggested. Maybe. President Obama described Gruber, who is an economist, as “some adviser who never worked on our staff [who] expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with, in terms of the voters, is no reflection on the actual process that was run.” Whom you believe\nprobably depends on which cable networks you watch. WE GENERALLY PUT such “news” into the category of “political noise.” That is, it’s of little real consequence unless somebody can score political points in an election. Such information is used mostly by partisan broadcasters to drive ratings and political causes to raise funds. This editor monitors the “news” from both camps. While the right-wing media were on fire with the Gruber revelations, the TV networks and websites that serve the political left had different ideas about what was “news.” The left thought it was a big deal that Sen. John McCain had sharply criticized Sen. Ted Cruz in what must be the beginning of the end of the Republican Party. And our progressive friends were all over the story out of Kansas, where deep tax cuts by conservative Gov. Sam Brownback have led to a huge state budget deficit and deep cuts in education spending, not the economic growth that he had promised with his experiment in\nsupply-side economics – the same philosophy we’ve heard from Illinois Gov.-elect Bruce Rauner. For the record, you didn’t read that “political noise” in this newspaper, either. Editors got to edit. LIKE EVERYTHING WE receive, letters to the editor are subject to our editing. One reader recently objected to our editing of his letter, as well as the headline we put on it. “When I e-mail you and say to put in verbatim, it means as I said,” his follow-up note scolded. “I fit the 300word guideline. Please do not put a heading like that again. I would appreciate an e-mail if you need me to give a heading. I also realize you probably had good intentions.” For letters, 300 words is a maximum length, not an entitlement. We edit for both length and content. Every letter gets a heading – if you don’t write one, we will. We wish we had the time to collaborate with writers on the editing and headlines of all things submitted, but we don’t have. And, yes, we meant well. But editors got to edit.\nS E L A S\nPRE-BLACK FRIDAY\nExisting US Cellular Customers can get the\nLG PAD $ .01 for just\n2 yeaar contract required.

She knew. Brenda left work immediately and started the drive back toward Amboy from Rock Falls, all the while scanning the horizon for signs of smoke. She saw none. “I was just devastated, devastated,” she said. “You’re running the whole gamut of feelings, but just as long as I knew the kids were OK, I knew I could make it through anything else.” As she got closer and closer, still no smoke. Then she rounded the corner, and that’s when she saw it. “It was a total loss; there wasn’t anything left,” she said. “We were standing there around all of the fire trucks and watching everything happen, watching our house burn.

The ruling will be appealed to the state Supreme Court, the Illinois attorney general’s office said. The pension patch that legislators and Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn OK’d last December was intended to make up for years\nof government underfunding that had left the state’s retirements accounts roughly $100 billion short of what they need to cover benefits promised to employees.

Six of those years included 9-0 regular seasons, in 1979-80, and again from 1983-86. There were two first-round playoff exits (1983 and 1985), one semifinal berth (1986), and two title game appearances (1979-80).\nOnly once, however, were the Clippers able to seal the deal and win a state championship. That was 30 years ago, on Nov. 23, 1984. “It’s just unreal – it sure doesn’t seem like 30 years ago,” said Sam Jones, a 6-foot-3, 289-pound defensive lineman, who is now the Amboy wrestling coach. “Sometimes I break out the tapes and watch them.” When Jones watches those tapes, he sees a team that outscored 13 opponents by a combined score of 438-127, including 34294 in Three Rivers Conference action. Few of the TRAC-8 teams were able to hang with the Clippers, with only one game decided by less than three touchdowns.

I have not looked at any official statistics or anything, but this has to be one of the coldest Novembers of all time. We just finished up a 9-day stretch of belowfreezing weather, and we haven’t even made it to Thanksgiving yet. Most of these days were windy as all get out, which made things real uncomfortable on top of it. I have been through about a case of handwarmers already, and have somehow managed to underdress for a handful of hunts that turned into real kneeknockers. The cold weather hasn’t been all bad, though, as things in the woods have been great this whole month. I have spotted a ton of big old turkeys so far this season, and lots of fat raccoons moving around during the day, as well. This past week, I almost arrowed a mean old coyote, and the same day, a mink slipped through the slough behind me, and a beaver the size of a dang moose hurried across the lane in front of me dragging a small tree. It’s neat to see so many different species of animals moving around just doing their thing. The deer, though, have taken the cake for me. I’ve seen a real decent amount of deer so far this year, in all shapes and sizes.

He got his wish Friday night at Lancaster Gymnasium. Dixon built a doubledigit first-half lead, then weathered a spirited comeback effort by the Rock Falls Rockets in a 50-38 victory at the Sauk Valley Shootout. “When things get tough, you just have to be tougher,” sophomore forward Isabelle Shiaras said. “We just had to be patient, stay calm and relaxed, and not play too fast when they started making shots.” Patience and composure were the key in the early going, as the Duchesses (1-2) looked smooth running their offense. Shiaras and Hartle each had two first-quarter baskets in the paint, and Tyler Smith nailed a pair of 3-pointers to stake Dixon to a 14-2 lead after one quarter. The Duchesses then closed the first half with a 6-2 run over the final 3:10, taking time off the clock each possession and finding the best possible shot. Shiaras assisted on Katie Provo’s bucket, then hit a jumper before scoring on a putback as the halftime buzzer sounded for a 24-12 lead at the break. “We were really pumped for this game, and we wanted to show the home fans what we could do,” Smith said. “Getting that early lead really built our confidence, and showed us our offense works if we trust it.” Dixon stretched the lead to 17 out of the locker room, as Hartle scored inside before Smith knocked down another 3 for a 29-12 lead. But that seemed to wake up the Rockets (2-1). Chelsi Blair hit a 3 off a pump fake, then proceeded to hit two more on consecutive possessions down the stretch in the third quarter to help turn a 33-19 deficit into a 33-27 margin heading into the final 8 minutes.\nSaturday Men’s basketball 3 p.m.\n• Malcolm X at Sauk Valley\nWomen’s basketball 1 p.m.\n• Malcolm X at Sauk Valley\nGirls basketball 9 a.m.\n• Forreston tournament, Eastland vs. Forreston 12:00 p.m.\n• Zetterburg tournament, Faith Christian vs. Grace Baptist 4 p.m.\n• Zetterburg tournament, Faith Christian vs. Cornerstone 5 p.m.\n• Ridgewood tournament, Erie vs. Bushnell-Prairie City 5:30 p.m.\n• AFC tournament, West Carroll vs. AFC Philip Marruffo/pmarruffo@saukvalley.com\nRock Falls’ Emily Sauer (11) grabs a rebound in front of Dixon’s Isabelle Shiaras during Friday’s Sauk Valley Shootout game at Lancaster Gym.

We knew we had a lot of game left after they got that early lead, but I guess we didn’t have enough game left, and we didn’t click enough.” With Rock Falls in a frenzy, Dixon’s calm demeanor kicked in again. Following a timeout, the teams traded missed shots, then the Duchesses scored the next two trips on putbacks to right the ship. “Those baskets off offensive rebounds were a mood-killer,” Blair said. “It got harder to fight back after that.” “Coach [Luke] Ravlin told us during the\nBLACK FRIDAY SALE STARTS NOW!!!

The goal was to make a combined 85 shots from various spots on the floor, including both elbows and the low blocks, in those 4 minutes. The players ran back to their spots in line after shots, and made quick passes to get the ball to the next shooter and, with just a few seconds to spare, the Golden Warriors sunk that 85th basket. “It’s a fun thing to do,” Preston said. “It adds a challenge to practice with some pressure, but it gets the guys to work together.” The first time Preston did the challenge this season, the number of baskets was set at 75. Once the players hit that mark, Preston moved the number to 80, and then soon to 85. That challenge at the end of practice has set a precedence for the upcoming season of playing with energy and as a team. Taped to the bleachers were cards that carried Preston’s 5 E’s, words like energy and excitement. Senior forward Ryan Hurley said those are important to remember, because he knows his team won’t out-size anybody this season, and that playing quick and organized will be the key to success. Hurley is coming off a long state run in golf, and recently picked up a basketball for the first time in months. “I was pretty rusty,” Hurley said of his shot. “Golf was about being calm and concentrated, and this is totally different.

BELOW: Quarterback Ben Leake tries to run around a defender during one of the Clippers’ games in 1984.\nAmboy champs in 1984? You bet! Clippers learned from ’83 first-round loss BY BRIAN WEIDMAN bweidman@saukvalley.com 800-798-4085, ext. 5551\nBrad Goy had 1,000 reasons to want the 1984 Amboy High School football team to win a state championship. In the fall of 1983, Goy was a junior lineman for the Clippers. Amboy was 9-0 and the No. 2-ranked Class 2A team in the state, and faced a firstround playoff matchup against No. 1 Ottawa Marquette, which was also undefeated. It was a state championship-quality game to open the playoffs, held on a Wednesday night back in those days. The Clippers and Crusaders battled back and forth, but in the end, it was Marquette that prevailed 16-12. Afterward, in the tearfilled hallways at Amboy High School, the juniors on that team vowed they would not be in that position the following year. Goy, in fact, bet Mark Kaleel, a fullback on Amboy’s 1979 state runner-up team, $100 that the Clippers would win a state championship the following season. Kaleel offered up 10-to1 odds on that proposition, and Goy accepted. He knew that his class was loaded with talent, and would be regaining the services of Dennis Ely, a speedy back who missed his junior season with a knee injury suffered in a 3-wheeler accident just before preseason practice was to start. “That team, when they were juniors, that’s really what made us a fairly good team when I was a senior,” said Gary Koch, a two-way starter for the 1983 club. “If it wasn’t for those guys, we wouldn’t have been near the team we were.” A little more than a year later, the Clippers put the finishing touches on a 13-0 season and the first team state championship in school history. Goy was also in for a big payday from Kaleel, who would later become his brother-in-law. “That was motivation right there,” Goy said with a laugh. “I did just make him pay the $100.” The 1984 Amboy squad shared a trait – confidence, bordering on cockiness – that is common among championship squads. They were in junior high when the golden age of Amboy football was in its infancy. They were in the stands when the Clippers\nfinished second at state in 1979, and again in 1980. When they got to high school, they planned to finish the job. “This was our goal since we were in 8th grade,” said Sam Jones, an anchor at defensive tackle. “There was probably nothing that was going to stop us.” There were obstacles along the way, but nothing a confident crew couldn’t overcome. After a 5-0 start, quarterback Dan Etheridge went down with a broken left arm in Week 6 against Fulton. He got sacked, and in the process of trying to break his fall, his arm snapped. “He was just screaming,” said Goy, the left tackle. “We all went back and looked, and bones were sticking out of his arm. It was gruesome.” Ben Leake, a starting safety for the Clippers, took over at quarterback. Instead of teammates trying to pump him up in a tough spot, it was Leake who took charge immediately. “We didn’t say a whole lot to Ben – he said it to us,” Ely said. “He came in and he said, ‘All right guys, this isn’t the end of the game. We’re running the 42 option pass, touchdown, and this is for Dan.’ That’s a bomb, right off the bat, on his first play. “He threw it, and it was to me. I had to dive, and I caught it, but if he would have hit me in stride, it would have been a touchdown. I come back to the huddle, he slaps me on the back\nand says, ‘Sorry about that. I thought you were a little faster.’” After a 9-0 regular season, the Clippers’ confident ways continued come playoff time. Before a secondround game against the Wethersfield Flying Geese, four Clippers (Goy, Dennis Ely, Brian Ely, and Leake) went duck hunting that morning. After a 34-6 rout, they hunted some more. “We got quite a few in the morning,” Dennis Ely said, “so we went back and got some more.” Before a semifinal game against Woodstock Marian, Goy and Dennis Ely went deer hunting. “Coach [Don] Wyzgowski said don’t get up too early,” Goy said. “When I got to the school, he asked if I went hunting, and I said yes I did. He just smiled at me.” When asked who the spiritual ringleader of the 1984 team was, Goy, Dennis Ely, and Jones agreed it was Tony Albiero, a fearsome linebacker and offensive guard. He was a terror on defense, with 128 tackles, two interceptions and two fumble recoveries. Albiero riled up his teammates with pregame dances on tables and benches, with Queen’s “We are the Champions” playing at ear-splitting volume. After games, it was Albiero dancing again, to another ditty by Queen, “Another One Bites the Dust.” “He’d get everybody fired up,” Ely said.\nB6 • SV Weekend Dilbert by Scott Adams\nwww.saukvalley.com\nZits® by Jerry Scott and Jim Borgman\nArlo & Janis by Jimmy Johnson Garfield by Jim Davis\nStone Soup by Jan Eliot Get Fuzzy by Darby Conley\nBlondie by Dean Young & John Marshall\nWizard of Id by Brant Parker and Johnny Hart\nPearls Before Swine by Stephan Pastis Rose is Rose by Pat Brady and Don Wimmer\nPickles by Brian Crane Big Nate by Lincoln Peirce\nBorn Loser by Art and Chip Sansom\nBaby Blues by Jerry Scott & Rick Kirkman\nSoup To Nutz by Rick Stromoski\nFamily Circus by Bil Keane\nThe Argyle Sweater by Scott Hilburn\nAlley Oop by Dave Graue and Jack Bender\nBridge Frank & Ernest by Bob Thaves\nAfter the bidding, what comes next?\nGrizzwells by Bill Schorr\nThe opening lead decides the fate of the contract a fair amount of the time. To gain some help with this aspect of the game, you could do a lot worse than to buy “Larry Teaches Opening Leads,” which has been written and published by Larry Cohen. It starts with 50 large pages of basic instruction, each chapter ending with a quiz. Then over the last 14 pages, Cohen moves on to more advanced topics like Rusinow and third-and-fifth leads, which are popular in the tournament world. There is also a discussion of later leads – as in today’s deal from the book. Look at the West and North hands. Defending against three no-trump, you (West) lead the heart seven, of\ncourse. South takes the trick with his jack and attacks diamonds. What is your plan? You know that declarer started with the heart ace-\nking-jack. You need partner to be long and strong in spades. (If South has at least 15 highcard points, partner cannot have the club ace-queen.) So, in case declarer has five club tricks to go with three hearts and one diamond, you should take the second trick and immediately shift to the spade three, the low card saying that you have at least one honor in the suit and are trying to win tricks in this suit. (If you had wanted partner to go back to hearts, you would have led a high spade, not your lowest.) Partner wins with his spade jack and returns a low spade to your king. Your side takes one diamond and four spades for down one. Here, if you duck the second trick, partner will discard the club two on the next diamond, making the spade switch even clearer. © 2014 UFS\nSaturday, November 22, 2014\n6 HOUR SALE AFTER THANKSGIVING\nSunday, November 23 Through Sunday, December 7, 2014\n2\nFriday, November 28, 2014 6 AM – 12 PM DOORS OPEN AT 6 AM FRIDAY\nDAY SUPER SALE\nFriday, November 28 & Saturday, November 29, 2014 DOORS OPEN AT 6 AM FRIDAY\nHUGE HOME IMPROVEMENT\nFriday, November 28 Through Sunday, November 30, 2014 DOORS OPEN AT 6 AM FRIDAY\nCLOSED THANKSGIVING DAY\nOne St p g!

There were two games that did stand out in the middle of the season – a Week 5 game against Newman and a Week 6 contest against Fulton. Both Newman and Amboy entered the game with 4-0 records, and interest in the game was at a fever pitch. A Dixon Evening Telegraph (as the paper was known then) preview article featured large pictures of Comets coach Mike Papoccia and Clippers coach Don Wyzgowski facing each other, as if they were boxers heading into a ring for combat. “It was a typical Amboy-Newman game,” said Gary Jones, Amboy’s defensive coordinator back then, and now the head coach. “Nobody liked each other. I think it was more relevant back then compared to now as far as the rivalry goes – there was some hatred back then.” It turned out to be Newman that hated the outcome of the game. The Comets scored first, but it was all Clippers after that, and they went on to a 42-24 victory. “It was a tight game,” Ely said, “and they were a hard-hitting team, I do remember that. In the second half, I think we broke away a little bit.” Tim Nelson, currently the Newman defensive coordinator, was a standout lineman for the Comets that season. He tipped his cap to the Clippers. “We played against those guys for 4 years, and they were just a really good team,” Nelson said. “We had some talent, too, that year – we finished 7-2. The difference between us and them is they knew they could beat us, and we didn’t think we could beat them.” The win vaulted Amboy to the top spot in the Class 2A Associated Press poll. The previous No. 1, East St. Louis Assumption, had to forfeit three games due to using an ineligible player. The next week, Amboy took on Fulton and rolled to a 47-12 victory. There was no reason to celebrate, however. On the game’s first play, senior quarterback Dan Etheridge went down with a broken left arm. The job now belonged to fellow senior Ben Leake, who had played defense. While not the passer that Etheridge was, Leake had leadership skills that sent a clear message to his teammates. “He didn’t have any fear,” Goy said. “He’d pitch the ball on the option, and then he’d sprint ahead and take two guys out.” Like Etheridge, Leake had the opportunity to call his own offensive plays. With four regular season games under his belt, he was brimming with confidence, guiding an offensive machine. In the first round of the playoffs, the Clippers hammered Princeville 26-0. When asked about that game, Ely spoke\nRushing Att. Dennis Ely 144 Scott Montavon 115 Brian Ely 162 Passing C-A-I Ben Leake 39-92-5 Dan Etheridge 30-60-5 Receiving Rec.

The Clippers won that game 16-7 to claim the program’s first state championship. about Leake. “He’d go up to the line, he’d tell the defense where we were going and say, ‘See if you can stop us,’” Ely said. “He pretty much ran at their toughest defensive guy, knocked him down in the first quarter, and then the game was over. If you took his heart out of the game, the rest of the team fell apart.” Amboy’s defense also flexed its muscles. The Princes had a back, John Gualandi, who had rushed for 1,100 yards in the regular season. The Clippers held him to 33. In the quarterfinals, Wethersfield offered only token resistance on its way to a 34-6 defeat at the hands of the Clippers. That set up a semifinal against defending Class 2A state champion Woodstock Marian, which ran its winning streak to 24 games with a 34-7 win over Polo in the quarterfinals. The Hurricanes were led by the 1-2 combo of tailback Dan Fortin, who had rushed for 1,385 yards and 16 touchdowns, and quarterback George Powers, who had completed 68 of 128 passes for 1,111 yards. Coach Jones noted the Clippers hadn’t faced a team that was as balanced and effective offensively as Marian. The strategy – get to Powers, early and often, with one or two blitzers, in addition to heat from the defensive line, on virtually every play. “If he’s on his back, he can’t throw,” coach Jones said. “That was our game plan. We got a lot of pressure on him that entire game.” The plan worked to a tee in a 36-27 Amboy victory – a score made that close by a late Hurricane TD against Clipper reserves. “Our defensive line forced Marian to pass and that’s where we won the game,” Wyzgowski was quoted as saying. “I didn’t think they could run the ball on us and I was right. Their passer did a good job when he had some time, but we kept the pressure on him and sacked him four or five times.” Health issues, however, were starting to creep into the Clippers’ camp. John\nBothe, a starting tight end and defensive end, suffered a dislocated shoulder in the third quarter against Woodstock Marian. A doctor on the Marian sideline, seeing what was happening on the field, walked out to assess the situation, offered his services, and popped the shoulder back into place. “I don’t know that I could have played the next week if he didn’t pop my shoulder back in,” Bothe said. On Wednesday of championship week, the Clippers went to Northern Illinois University to practice on artificial turf – a common practice for teams from this part of the state to get used to the playing surface they’d be playing on at Hancock Stadium, at Illinois State. During that practice, however, twoway starting lineman Scott Meadows, an all-conference and all-area performer, suffered a knee injury that ended his season. Also, Ely aggravated a knee injury, but not badly enough to keep him out of the title game against Paxton. “I was hurting pretty bad out there,” Ely said. Amboy hadn’t trailed the entire season, but found itself behind 7-0 in the title game after Paxton quarterback Brad Forsyth scored on a 12-yard run with 3 minutes, 36 seconds left in the second quarter. The play was set up when a Paxton punt hit the helmet of a Mustang coverage player, and that player then plowed into Amboy return man Scott Montavon. An official ruled Montavon fumbled on the play. “It’s just something that you’ve got to overcome,” Sam Jones said. “Our defense was still playing really well at the time.” The Amboy offense, largely quiet up to that point, got into the act late in the second quarter when Leake found David Ely on a 24-yard touchdown pass. There were just 6 seconds left until halftime. At the half, coach Jones took it upon himself to light a fire under the Clippers, as there had been some uncharacteristic bickering in the ranks. He began by kicking a trash can across the room, sending\nYards 1,119 880 733\nYards TDs 643 6 488 5 Yards 525 235 279 162\nTDs 5 1 3 2\nit flying against the wall. He then gave the team his best Knute Rockne. “I just told them to knock some stuff off,” coach Jones said. “There were a few choice words in there that you couldn’t put in the paper.” The Clippers took their first lead on a 21-yard field goal by Don Althaus with 10:42 left in the fourth quarter. The 3-pointer was set up by a 22-yard pass from Leake to Bothe, whose shoulder was kept in place by a harness to limit mobility. Bothe also delivered a key play on special teams. His 52-yard punt was downed by David Ely at the Paxton 1-foot-line with about 3 minutes to play. “That ball really came off my foot nice,” Bothe said, “but that play was all David Ely. It looked like the ball was headed into the end zone until he saved it.” On the next play, Forsyth’s pass was picked off by Leake at Paxton 12. Three plays later, Leake scored on a sneak, the extra point made the score 16-7, and the Clippers had their title. The Amboy players were treated to a post-game meal at a smorgasbord in El Paso, then were greeted by the flashing lights and blaring sirens of police cars and fire trucks when they got back home. A reception in a jam-packed AHS gymnasium followed, and then the whole team went over to Leake’s house for a night of revelry. “I think that’s just something that you never forget,” Ely said of the team-only celebration. “That’s a feeling that’s going to stay with you forever. When you win something like that, and everybody’s together, that was a good time, a special time.” When asked how he celebrated that evening, coach Jones broke into a smile. “All I know is we had a lot of Diet Cokes and a lot of pizza after all those games over at Wyzgowski’s house,” coach Jones said. Wyzgowski was the head coach at Amboy for 20 years (1974-93), and guided his teams to a 131-67 record. He and assistant coach Jim Mahar literally had to go door-to-door to find players at the beginning of that period. “He took it from nothing,” said Jones, who joined the staff in 1977 as defensive coordinator, “and he built it up.” Ely was happy the 1984 team could deliver a championship for Wyzgowski, a 2000 Illinois High School Football Coaches and Officials Association hall of famer. Wyzgowski died in a car accident on Sept. 18, 2005. “I think everybody respected and loved Don,” Ely said. “He was a good coach.”\n1984 AMBOY CLIPPERS AT A GLANCE WEEK 1\nWEEK 2\nSept. 7, 1984 Amboy 37, Hall 8\nSept. 14, 1984 Amboy 54, Mendota 6\nSept. 21, 1984 Amboy 39, Riverdale 6\nSept. 28, 1984 Amboy 42, Erie 14\nOct. 5, 1984 Amboy 42, Newman 24\nOct. 12, 1984 Amboy 47, Fulton 12\nOct. 19, 1984 Amboy 26, Prophetstown 6\n• The championship campaign started with a safety by defensive tackle Scott Meadows in the first quarter in Spring Valley. Brian Ely and Dennis Ely followed with firstquarter touchdowns, and the rout was on. Hall was held to 109 total yards. Scott Montavon led Amboy with 93 rushing yards on 11 carries.\n• The Clippers accumulated 471 yards of offense in their first home game against the Trojans. QB Dan Etheridge had two touchdown scampers as part of a 6-minute span in the first quarter where Amboy scored three times. Etheridge threw for 134 yards, and Montavon racked up 105 yards on the ground.\n• The Rams managed only 24 yards of offense for the night, even after a 60-yard TD pass in the first half. Riverdale had two first downs, both through the air, while Amboy had 386 yards of offense. Dennis, Brian and Dave Ely all scored touchdowns. Dennis Ely averaged 11.2 yards per carry, finishing with 101 yards on nine carries.\n• The Clippers brought a No. 3 ranking in 2A into Erie, and didn’t waste any time proving why they were ranked by jumping out to a 42-0 lead. Tony Albiero kicked six PATs and returned an interception for a touchdown. Dennis Ely and Montavon both scored two touchdowns.\n• The Comets scored first in a clash of undefeated teams, but the good news for Newman ended there. Etheridge had a big game, completing 10 passes for 231 yards. His favorite target was Dennis Ely, who had four catches for 114 yards and two TDs. John Bothe caught a 61-yard TD in the third quarter.\n• The good news was that Amboy jumped to No. 1 in the 2A poll. The bad news happened when Etheridge broke his arm on the first play against the Steamers. Ben Leake, a defensive back by trade, came in to run the option offense to the tune of 35 firsthalf points. Leake completed 5 of 8 passes for 72 yards.\n• The Prophets came in 6-0 and hadn’t allowed a score in 15 quarters. That streak extended one more quarter before Amboy scored on the third play of the second quarter. Leake threw for 198 yards, and the Clippers amassed 356 yards on the touted Prophets’ defense.\nWEEK 8\nOct. 26, 1984 Amboy 14, Morrison 12\nNov. 2, 1984 Amboy 41, Savanna 6\nNov. 7, 1984 Amboy 26, Princeville 0\nNov. 10, 1984 Amboy 34, Wethersfield 6\nNov. 17, 1984 Amboy 36,\nNov. 23, 1984 Amboy 16, Paxton 7\n• John Clayton’s firstquarter interception of Morrison QB Todd Cassens proved huge, as he rumbled to the 16-yard line that set up Amboy’s first score. Aaron Walter added an interception on the next series. Brian Ely and Leake had TD runs, as all the scoring was done in the first half in the Clippers’ toughest clash of the regular season.\n• Montavon had TD runs of 2, 3 and 31 yards in the first half, as the Clippers clinched a perfect season and a Three Rivers championship. Savanna, which went winless for the season, was held to 44 yards. Dennis Ely and Ed Powers added second-half scores as Amboy prepared for the playoffs.\n• Dennis Ely opened the scoring with a 57-yard touchdown in the first quarter, and it started a trend of big plays in the first round of the 2A playoffs. Two possessions later, Montavon broke into the open for a 75-yard TD. Later, Brian Ely took a screen pass from Leake for a 78-yard TD, as the Clippers beat the Princes in Princeville.\n• The Clippers held an explosive Wethersfield offense in check, allowing only one first down in the first half and a total of 130 yards in the game. Amboy scored three TDs in the second quarter to break the game open. Brian Ely, Dennis Ely and Leake scored touchdowns in the second quarter to make it 27-0.\nWoodstock Marian 27 • Dennis Ely shined as he rushed for 71 yards, had 92 receiving yards and scored four of the Clippers’ five touchdowns in knocking off defending state champion Woodstock Marian. Defensive players like Albiero, Jeff Shaw and Brad Goy helped make Marian a one-dimensional team by taking away the running game. Marian had won 24 games in a row.\n• The third state trip proved to be the charm, as Amboy won its first state title in football. Paxton had only 98 yards on offense as Albiero was dominant from his linebacker spot. Don Althaus kicked a 21-yard field goal with 10:42 left in the game to give Amboy its first lead at 9-7. Leake scored with 1:29 left to seal the win.\nSaturday, November 22, 2014\nMake The Sauk Valley Area YOUR\nAnd Register To Win Your Share Of...\n3000\nWorth of Sauk Valley Dollars 6 Winners Each Day!

The numbers reflect the change from 2012.\nSmall Business Saturday, the Black Friday for small local retailers, will return for a fourth consecutive year in the Sauk Valley on Nov. 29. The mayors of Sterling, Rock Falls and Dixon made it official with their respective proclamations. Small Business Saturday, born in 2010, borrows from the Thanksgiving shopping events that were conceived to help retail heavyweights maximize sales during the busiest shopping time of the year. November and December business is critical for retailers, usually making up between 20 and 40 percent of annual sales. American Express helps promote the nationwide Small Business Saturday, both in print and digital media.

Several local businesses, including Distinctive Gardens and Tuff Dog Bakery, have been highlighted in the American Express promotional efforts.\nFoot traffic Increased - 72% Decreased - 14% No change - 14% Lisa Higby-LeFevre, coowner of Dixon’s Distinctive Gardens, and a founder Sauk Valley Shop Small, said the event is evolving as it becomes more entrenched in the area. PEOPLE CONTINUED ON C8\nBUSINESS NOTEBOOK\nDixon man running food delivery service BY PAM EGGEMEIER peggemeier@saukvalley.com 800-798-4085, ext. 5570\nDIXON – Sam Elliott Jr.’s coworkers wanted to see a food taxi business in this area, so they asked Elliott whether he would start one. He thought about it, and said OK. “My co-workers know I’m reliable and good at customer\nservice,” said Elliott, 31, of Dixon. “I was thinking about it a long time ago, but the timing always seemed to be off.” While it might sound like an overly simplistic business plan, Elliott reports that Sauk Valley Food Taxi is off to a good start. Elliott still works at Walmart, and at this time, is flying solo with the food deliv-\nery business. He hopes to hire a daytime driver later so he can expand his delivery hours. Oh, and in his spare time, Elliott plans to run for mayor of Dixon. “I’ll be busy, but that’s the way I like it,” he said. “My goal is to never have a dull moment in my life.” Sauk Valley Food Taxi is\navailable for pickup and delivery from 5 to 11 p.m., 7 days a week, for a flat fee of $5. He delivers in Dixon, Sterling and Rock Falls. For delivery or more information about the business, visit saukvalleyfoodtaxi.com online, email Elliott at samuelgood01@gmail.com, or call 815-540-9410.\nDear Dave, My mother-in-law is in poor health and doesn’t have a lot of money. She has been giving us a lot of her earnings over the past couple of years as a kind of early inheritance, because she’s afraid she’ll spend it all. We’re setting it aside in a savings account in case she needs it, but I still feel strange about the situation. What do you recommend we do? – Andrew Dear Andrew, This is an odd scenario. It’s like taking donations from poor people because they refuse to address their own issues. My recommendation is pretty simple. She needs to learn how to properly handle her own money. Obviously, it wouldn’t be a good idea for you to say that to your mother-in-law, so your wife should be the one who attempts to lovingly and carefully deliver the message. The conversation still might not be pleasant, but there’s a better chance she’ll listen to a daughter than to you. I appreciate the fact that you and your wife aren’t being greedy or opportunistic about this situation. Setting the money aside and earmarking it for your mother-in-law later on is an honorable thing. If your wife can’t persuade her mom to start taking care of her own finances, at least you can protect her from herself. You’d still be treating the symptom instead of the problem, but if she won’t listen, it might be the best you can do. – Dave\nWedding bells times three Dear Dave, We have three daughters younger than 5, so we might be spending quite a bit on things like weddings in the years to come. Is there a Baby Step for weddings? If not, during which Baby Step do you recommend setting aside money for this? – Carrie RAMSEY CONTINUED ON C8\nC2 • SV Weekend\nwww.saukvalley.com\nArea veterans\nMarines chat before the Veterans Day ceremony Nov. 11 at Veterans Memorial Park in Dixon.

Could your child have done something that caused the animal to react defensively? If that might be the case, then your son should be taught about the proper handling of animals, because declawing a cat is not minor surgery. It’s like having the tips of one’s fingers amputated, and some cities have outlawed the practice. Contact Dear Abby at DearAbby.com or P.O.

Did you read that first sentence and think, “Pumpkin pie, dressing, gravy, turkey, and football games are good for me? Yes.”? It is true that thanksgiving is good for you, but it isn’t just about the day and the food. Being thankful is good for us all through the year. In fact, gratitude is good for your health. According to greatergood.berkeley. edu/expandinggratitude, scientists who research this say people who are thankful have stronger immune systems, more positive emotions, more joy and happiness, greater generosity, and less loneliness. Grateful people are healthier and happier. If you are on social media, you may have noticed that some people\nchristinaBERRY The Rev. Christina Berry is the pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Sterling.\nhave engaged in a “30 Days of Thankfulness” from time to time. And,of course, on Thanksgiving Day, many people will offer prayers of thanks for their family, friends, and health. But you can make thanksgiving a daily habit, even without the turkey and dressing. Here are a few ways to start: Each day when you wake up, give thanks for your life, your breath, and the new day.\nEach day, thank your spouse, children, or friends for the little things they do for you. Each week, spend a few moments recalling all you have to be thankful for. At First Presbyterian Church, we have a time of sharing joys each Sunday. It helps us remember to give thanks in all situations. Each month, take a few moments to write a note (and mail it) to someone expressing your gratitude. Consider those people who rarely are thanked – the custodian, your mail carrier, your child’s teachers. Thank them, in writing. Make thanksgiving a habit, and enjoy the benefits of gratitude. Also, enjoy the pumpkin pie, and be sure to thank the person who made it.\nCHURCH CONCERT\nMembers of the Altar and Rosary Society at St. Andrew Catholic Church in Rock Falls prepare for their annual cookie extravaganza.

One of those subgroups of six in Sterling is using a variation of a popular board game to bring some fun to the event. The idea for Scrabble Shop Small Style came from Penny Bright, owner of Golden Key Gifts.\n“I make up game boards that the customers travel with, and they start out with one letter, and the more times they go to the participating stores, the more chances they have to win,” Bright explained. The game started Nov. 15; game boards must be turned in at Golden Key by 6 p.m. Nov. 29. The six participating businesses – Golden Key Gifts, Beautiful You Boutique, Tuff Dog Bakery, Sauk Valley Reiki, Showplace Antiques, and Candy Bouquet – will award six $100 prizes.\nAnother addition this year is a Shop Small party at Rosbrook Studio, 107 S. Peoria Ave. in Dixon. Amid an island setting, Fire Sale – a reggae, dub and rock band from Iowa City – and local act Space Juice will perform.

The story you are being told is missing some important information. Be wary of anyone asking you to make a quick decision. MCT News Service\nCEO Gregg Weitzenkorn at Weitzenkorn’s clothing store, now offering everything from black tie to beachwear, is celebrating the store’s 150th anniversary in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. “I like the personal touch,” said Wentzel, 69. But to survive and grow, Weitzenkorn’s has had to expand beyond the familiar in customers, clothing styles, and business operations. The Weitzenkorns have adapted as the dress code for work and church has shifted for many from suit-only to casual, and shopping for clothes has moved from in-store to online. “These are trends that you can’t fight,” Gregg Weitzenkorn said. “It just happens.”\nAnchor store Gregg and Marc Weitzenkorn and their siblings grew up working in the family store. By then, the business had survived the economic impact of the Depression and two world wars. When the brothers were young, Pottstown was a thriving borough where area companies such as Bethlehem Steel, Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., and Mrs. Smith’s Pie Co. helped make up the town’s economic base. Downtown on High Street was the borough’s shopping center, and Weitzenkorn’s was an anchor store, said George Wausnock, former president of the Pottstown Historical Society. But as the big companies left in the 1970s and ’80s, the borough’s economic fortunes declined, Wausnock said. Nearby, retail trends – including the growth of strip malls, indoor malls, box stores and discount\nshopping centers – battered small businesses, taking away consumer dollars. Then came the Internet. High Street shops closed, and some storefronts were often unoccupied. Yet Weitzenkorn’s remained High Street’s anchor. Marc and Gregg Weitzenkorn, who began running the business after their father, Arthur, became ill in the late 1970s, had to cope with the challenges. They expanded the store and diversified merchandise – bringing in clothing lines for customers who are younger, and bigger and taller. Still, it was a struggle, Gregg Weitzenkorn said, and the recession also hit hard. At one point, Gregg Weitzenkorn thought that his family business might die after his generation. “I figured I’d work til retirement and then probably sell the store,” Gregg Weitzenkorn said. Then Gregg’s son, Aaron, 29, decided to join the family business and bring his digital know-how with him. Aaron Weitzenkorn had been working in finance. “I started to think I wanted something else, and the store was still there,” he said. He put together a proposal to take the family business online and implemented it. That part of Weitzenkorn’s now makes up about 30 percent of the family business. “The future looks much brighter,” Gregg Weitzenkorn said.\nEducation comes before wedding CONTINUED FROM C1\nDear Carrie, I don’t have a Baby Step for weddings, but in my mind it would come after Baby Step 5, which is putting aside a college fund for your children.

The impact of shopping at the mom-and-pop stores is also measurable. Shopping small means that $68 of every $100 spent stays local, compared with $43 of every $100 staying in the community when money is spent at big-box stores. Higby-LeFevre said the marketing efforts have changed, becoming more personal and taking on a yearlong focus. “The message is about more than just shop-\nping,” she said. “It’s moving away from things that are directly promotional, and becoming more about the people behind the businesses and how the community embraces Shop Small.” Membership in Shop Local now gives businesses administrative rights to the Sauk Valley Shop Small Facebook page. “We do things like a quote of the day and owner profiles, so the community can get to know the people behind the business and feel engaged.”\nAstrograph\nPENNSYLVANIA\nhen Abraham Weitzenkorn opened his family clothing store here, Abraham Lincoln was president, and stovepipe hats were the new black. Weitzenkorn, a German immigrant who had peddled his wares from a covered wagon, had saved enough to open a clothing shop, marketing his brand of overalls and work boots to farmers in the area. More than a century later, Weitzenkorn’s family still owns a men’s clothing store on a main street of the same borough. Weitzenkorn’s, now offering everything from black tie to beachwear, is celebrating its 150th anniversary, still standing after a shifting retail landscape and the decline of the manufacturing base in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, squashed other small businesses. The store’s longevity is remarkable, said Steve Bamford, executive director of Pottstown Area Industrial Development Inc., a nonprofit that promotes and facilitates economic growth in the region. Weitzenkorn’s might be the second-oldest independent menswear shop in the United States, behind Levy’s of Nashville, which has been run by the same family since 1855. “A lot of small independents like us have fallen left and right,” said Marc Weitzenkorn, 63, who runs the business as president with his brother, Gregg, 60, the company’s CEO. Yet Weitzenkorn’s might be observing its anniversary at a time when Pottstown’s economy is showing some positive momentum, Bamford said. Over the years, the family’s store on High Street has sold apparel to a loyal customer base, many of whom Marc and Gregg Weitzenkorn know on a first-name basis. Customer Mike Wentzel has shopped at the store for a decade.\nness Saturdays through surveys completed by participating retailers.

She provides horticulture programming to residents in Jo Daviess, Stephenson, Winnebago, Boone, DeKalb, and Ogle counties. “Travel can truly open up one’s eyes to a completely different world and can be absolutely life-changing,” Miller said. She was chosen out of many U.S. Extension educators to give a presentation on youth gardening at the September Korean Master Gardener International Conference at GyeongGi-do Agricultural Research and Extension Services. Her presentation focused on giving the newly-established Korean Master Gardener Program ideas on how to\nstart youth gardens in their communities. She shared some examples of successful youth gardening programs in her counties, such as the Junior Master Gardener Program in Ogle and Winnebago counties, and outlined the step-by-step process of establishing a youth garden. In addition, she shared a few activities that Master Gardeners utilize locally like an activity called ‘Calling All Insects’ that helps youth understand how insects can communicate with each other using sounds. According to Miller, in 2011, a graduate student at the University of Kentucky had the idea of introducing the Master Gardener Program to South Korea. She witnessed the program and thought it would be a great pro-\ngram to take to her native South Korea. Since then, Korea has trained 207 Master Gardeners, who have similar projects as the volunteers in the U.S. In Illinois, there are more than 3,400 Master Gardener volunteers in a program that was established 40 years ago. A large theme of the conference was focused on urban agriculture and horticulture, as one of the goals of GARES is to promote and educate more urban farmers. The Korean government sees the Master Gardener program as playing a pivotal role in promoting urban agriculture in the country.

Before heading back to his SUV and resuming his duty to serve and protect residents, as well as fill county coffers via issuing speeding tickets, this dedicated law enforcement officer lifted his aviator sunglasses and asked me a question. “Where’re you headed, anyway?” “Goldfield,” I said, pointing down Highway 95, where 20 miles away a town even smaller than Tonopah awaited. “Why you goin’ there?” “There’s an art installation outside of town,” I said. “Some artists buried colorful cars and buses in the desert.” “Never heard of it,” he said in a tone that seemed a tad wary to me. Awkward silence … “Well,” he said, backing away. “Remember, the speed limit’s 25 in all small towns in Nevada.” As I eased back into traffic, musing on how quickly that 75 mph sign switched to 25 mph as I neared civilization, the thought struck me: How is it that this deputy had never heard of the International Car Forest of the Last Church? I mean, there aren’t many other competing attractions anymore in Goldfield, an erstwhile mining boom town that once boasted Mark Twain among its residents, but now has been reduced to a sleepy one-pump-of-the-brake-pedal curiosity harboring 268 residents. What’s more, one of the architects of the Car Forest installation, Michael “Mark” Rippie, now is serving 2 years in federal prison on illegal firearm charges. So you might presume the cop would be clued in to this outsider art installation for its felonious creator, if not for the fact the site has drawn visitors from all over. In any event, I drove on, observing the posted speed limits. Upon reaching Goldfield, I slowed to a funereal 12 mph looking for the telltale rusted bus sticking up skyward from a scruffy brown bluff. And there it was, unmistakably piercing the impossibly\nWhere: Highway 95, in Goldfield, Nevada. From Tonopah, drive 20 miles south. Just past downtown Goldfield, turn left (east) to Crystal Avenue. Follow the dirt road a quarter-mile. Park on the side of the road and walk to the site. Information: www.facebook.com/carforest\nAlthough unsigned, the art installation is the work of two men. One is a well-respected artist from Reno, Nevada, Chad Sorg, whose paintings have been shown throughout the Southwest; the other is Michael “Mark” Rippie, an iconoclastic outsider who owned the patch of land and long sought a Guinness Book of World Records designation for number of cars stuck in the ground. blue horizon on a cloudless October morning. I turned off Highway 95 onto a bumpy dirt road called Crystal Avenue (no “Breaking Bad” jokes allowed, please). I eased past a warped wooden shack ringed by discarded major appliances, rusted box springs and bicycles tethered to barbed wire. A propped-up white car hood bearing the inscription “Looking 4 the End of the World?” with an arrow pointed me in the right direction. A few more twisty turns, past abandoned double-wide trailers, and the landscape opened up into a vast brown canvas. Cars, standing vertical like a post-apocalyptic skyline, dotted the rolling chaparral-laced high-desert rolling hills. Most were placed, hooddown, as if they did a “Thelma & Louise” swan dive off the bluff; some were buried trunk-down, as if awaiting liftoff. There appeared no pattern, nothing intricate like the noted “Carhenge” in Alliance, Nebraska, or the famous Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas. Only a lone sign served as the barest of explanations: “World’s Largest National Junk Car Forest! Artists Play Ground & ATV Park with Ultra light runways.” About 40 vehicles, mostly later 20th century sedans and station wagons with a few buses and\neven a burned-out ice cream truck, lay scattered over a few acres. Nearly all were painted vibrant colors – either swirling Pollock abstracts, O’Keeffean skulls, Picasso-like representations, and the occasional straight-ahead portrait – the overarching theme apparently being that there is no overarching theme. Its point is its pointlessness, its statement one of militant individuality, which plays well here in the desert. Although unsigned, it is the work of two men. One is a wellrespected artist from Reno, Nevada, Chad Sorg, whose paintings have been shown throughout the Southwest; the other is Rippie, the iconoclastic outsider who owned the patch of land and long sought a Guinness Book of World Records designation for number of cars stuck in the ground. The two met when Sorg happened to drive by Goldfield on Highway 95, saw a car sticking out of the ground, and stopped to inquire. The two worked together and completed the installation in 2011. “He came out and talked to me,” Sorg recalled. “He had his gun on his waist. It was a little scary, but I figured if this guy put these cars in the ground for art, for something creative, then he must not be too bad. [The relationship] eventually went terribly\nsour. That’s just the kind of guy he is. … We did the project, and then he was done with me.” Sorg returned to Reno for other artistic projects. And Rippie, according to The Associated Press, was arrested in 2013 for improperly possessing 15 firearms, including two loaded assault rifles and 22,000 rounds of ammunition. A jury found him guilty of “possession of a firearm by a person previously found to be a mental defective and committed to a mental institution and making false statements to acquire firearms.” Rippie’s arrest, however, does not cast a pall over the installation. It bears the mark of Sorg’s work and vision; Rippie, mostly, manned the backhoe to implant the vehicles. He painted many of the murals, including an evocative Cubist design on the roof of a rusted 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass featuring a blue bird emerging from the mouth of a man. Another shows a half-human, half-swan in handcuffs and impaled in a blue house with a picket fence. The canvas for that is a white Ford Mustang. The only political statement – and, frankly, it’s hard to discern its allegiances – is a portrait of Ron Paul on the roof of a blue hatchback. As close as you’ll get to an “Artist’s Statement” comes on a\n1970s station wagon, nose down. Spelled out on the roof: “Dada,” the early 20th-century art movement that rejected logic and order and embraced irrationality and barely controlled chaos. “There’s definitely not a unifying theme,” Sorg said. “We talked about that in the beginning. We decided people can do whatever they want out there. Hopefully, they don’t paint over something I painted. My favorite is the horse skull on the station wagon.” What do Goldfieldites, who like to play up the town’s historic hotel and courthouse and gold mining past, think of the Car Forest? It was hard to find anyone around on a weekday – even the Chamber of Commerce was closed – but if the cashier at the general store (called The General Store) is any indication, they don’t think much of this public art piece. “That guy Rippie,” said Kassandra Huskey, the general store worker, “was one of those guys who’d drive around town with ‘F- the Cops’ on his vehicles. I think he did a lot of those cars on BLM land just to spite the government. It was not an art thing; it was a spite thing. “People here used to go knock them down or set them on fire, and he’d put them right back up. Even now, so many people stop at it and then they come here and ask if they can buy him a bottle of wine. I say, ‘But he’s in prison now.’ They’re like, ‘Oh, can we send it to him?’ People like it. But I still have no idea what his intention was.” No matter the intention, the result stands out starkly and, yes, beautifully, in the vast brown expanse of the high desert. Ah, if only I could’ve picked out that white Nye County sheriff’s SUV in Tonopah as easily as you can see the cars implanted in the dusty hills of Goldfield.\nSaturday, November 22, 2014\nUNITED WAY OF LEE COUNTY\nFIREHOUSE MINISTRIES\nWith one report session remaining, the United Way of Lee County campaign is at 70 percent of its $400,000 goal, collecting $279,964 to date.
