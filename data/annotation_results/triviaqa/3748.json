        "\nDOCUMENT 1:\n\nThe Last Waltz; REVIEWS. Engelbert is ... the wonderful Herman's Hermits hit \"There's a Kind of Hush ... a U.K. and U.S. singles chart history from 1967 to 1970, ... Engelbert Humperdinck His Greatest Hits The Last Waltz\nREVIEWS\nEngelbert is long overdue a three disc box set to contain some of the fantastic songs from the first dozen or so years of his nearly four decade long career, those melodies that hold so many memories, sung to perfection by \"The King of Romance\"; for now they are scattered among dozens of CDs, and to get all one's favorites means purchasing multitudes of compilations. Though practically all will include \"Release Me\", there are lesser known beauties that are \"must haves\". This is a terrific grouping, and the rarity on it is \"Ten Guitars\", and to a lesser extent \"Everybody Knows (We're Through)\", which is sung from a woman's point of view, and from his first \"Release Me\" LP, the wonderful Herman's Hermits hit \"There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)\", and \"My World\" (sometimes listed as \"Il Mondo\"). \nAlso included is the song I could listen to for hours, \"The Way it Used to Be\", the exquisite \"Les Bicyclettes de Belsize\", and the waltz to end all waltzes, \"The Last Waltz\". These are all the original recordings, and the sound is O.K., though not as good when compared to \"Ultimate Collection\" or \"Greatest Love Songs\", which are two compilations that are on the top of the heap for excellence, and deserve to be in every Engelbert collection. \nThe booklet insert includes a mini bio and most appreciated, a U.K. and U.S. singles chart history from 1967 to 1970, and total playing time is 43'19. \nReview From: Alejandra Vernon, Amazon on 2011-05-26\nBorn in Madras, India, in 1936, Arnold Dorsey, a.k.a. Englebert Humperdinck, became one of the best pop singers of the late 60's through the 70's, and even up to the present. This collection contains his greatest hits between the period of 1966 to 1969, plus 5 songs that weren't released as singles but were still very popular during that time...and of course, they still are. These are songs that will always be good to listen to. Booklet contains a 2 page essay about E.H, plus a U.K. & U.S. Singles Chart History, which is very informative.\nReview From: G. Sawaged, Amazon on 2011-05-26\nWonderful music, great listening\nReview From: a reviewer, cd Universe on 2011-05-26\nUSER REVIEWS\nPosted By\nMomsy158\n\"Have the CD version of this album.  It's a little annoying that the American version has only 10 songs, while the UK version has 12.  But regardless of how many songs, it's still a nice collection of some of his classic hits.  Definitely well worth getting, having, and listening.\"\nPosted on: September, 13 2011 20:45 PM\nPosted By\nBilliej\n\"Wow all these songs turned out to be so popular for this great man.Would love to ear IL MONDO more. I thought he would of on these early albums. Love it though!  Billie\"\nPosted on: June, 12 2011 20:43 PM\nIf you would like to post a review, please register .

Small Ritual - The Last Waltz 1 Small Ritual - The Last Waltz 1\nsteve[at]smallritual[dot]org\nImages & words © Steve Collins unless otherwise noted\nOther Smallritual sites\nThe Last Waltz:\nhow the Church never made it past 1967 [part 1]\nThe middle years of the 1960s were the last great era of faith. Faith, that is, in science and technology as saviours, makers of a new heaven and a new earth coming down from outer space. The later years of the decade marked a turning point, as scientific progress ceased to be an unquestioned good, as the environmental and social costs of modernity became a cause for concern. The turn of the tide was visible early in seemingly superficial things. Modernist styles in fashion and design were supplemented or replaced by historical revivals. Musical culture concentrated ever more on sensual, irrational experience. Design guru Paul Reilly, writing in 1966, sensed that television and magazines had undermined modernity, as people saw the historical and the modern side by side as equals to be chosen or mixed, rather than as a linear progression with the modern superseding the historical. The stylistic and behavioural revolutions of the 60s were the firstfruits of an enduring cultural change. Somewhere between 1965 and 1968, Western society crossed the boundary from modern to postmodern.\nPeople now in their 60s and 70s were in their 30s during the 1960s. Some embraced the new culture. Some saw themselves as already too old. And many followed the changes up to a point where the aesthetic and cultural break with their own formative years was too great, and stopped there. The sea-change in sentiment can be symbolised by the failure of the Beatles' single 'Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane', the firstfruits of the 'Sergeant Pepper' sessions, to reach number 1 in February 1967 - their first single to miss number 1 since 'Love Me Do'. The song that outsold it, 'Release Me' by Engelbert Humperdinck, illustrates the desire of a significant - generally older - part of the pop audience for a more straightforward and comforting music.\nThis has been noted by several writers on the period, because it contradicts the myth of 1967 as belonging to the counterculture. In the year of Jimi Hendrix and the Monterey pop festival, 'Sergeant Pepper' and the Summer of Love, the three best-selling singles were all by Humperdinck. As the Beatles and others turned to sonic experimentation, and pop music abandoned traditional song-and-melody structures for groove or noise, a generation of older followers turned back. Over the next few years record shops would invent the category 'Easy Listening' as a catch-all meaning 'anything liked by people over a certain age' - and the term speaks volumes for what those people thought of the new directions in rock and soul. Interestingly, this was the age group who were going to be leaders in their churches for the rest of the 20th century.\nWhen we look at the age profile of the English Church as revealed in current statistics it is clear that the 'missing generations' are those who were young in the 1960s and after. It seems very much as if the 1960s cultural shift is passing upward through the population, eliminating Christianity as it goes. Why should the Church be hit so hard in this way? Many things could be said, but in essence most churches have never achieved a form of Christian spirituality native to the new culture, but have lingered in the old order, through nostalgia, distaste, fear or uncertainty.\n\n"
