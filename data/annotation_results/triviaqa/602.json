The music, Rossini's \"William Tell Overture\", was written in 1829. (It is said that the definition of an intellectual is someone who can listen to this music and not think of the Lone Ranger.)\n \n                                             Clayton Moore, as the Lone Ranger of TV fame, with Silver\n   \n    The other night, those thrilling sounds came back as I watched the 1981 movie, \"The Legend of the Lone Ranger\", a big-budget production that bombed in theaters back then, although I saw it then and liked it and still enjoyed the film, 29 years later. My generation remembers the Ranger through the TV series. My parents' generation first heard his adventures on the radio, and my kids' generation---well, that's a sad tale, which we'll get to later.\n \n    In America of the early 1930s, with the Great Depression tightening its noose around the country's collective throat, radio was one of the few ways people could escape the increasing desperation of their daily lives. Radio provided news and sports, just like today, but also game shows, variety programs, and dramas. Unlike many parts of the economy, radio was thriving. In Detroit, radio station mogul George W. Trendle wanted to create a new hero to star in a drama to be produced by his flagship station, WXYZ. He wanted somebody like Robin Hood or Zorro, so he came up with the concept of an Old West lawman, a former Texas Ranger who wore a mask and rode a white horse. He gave the idea to one of his writers, Fran Striker, to flesh out. \"The Lone Ranger\" premiered on WXYZ and several other stations in Michigan in January 1933, and was an immediate hit. Within months, the stations would be overwhelmed with the response. A year later, Trendle took his show national over the fledgling Mutual network, and started counting the money.\n \n    Trendle and his writers developed a back story for the Ranger that has been used virtually unaltered in every succeeding version. Around 1870, a platoon of Texas Rangers, including two brothers named Reid, are in pursuit of the Butch Cavendish gang. The Rangers are ambushed in a narrow canyon and left for dead. A day later, a wandering Indian named Tonto comes onto the scene, discovering that one Ranger, who turns out to be the younger Reid brother, is still alive. Nursed back to health by Tonto, Reid vows to avenge the deaths of his brother and the other Rangers by tracking down Cavendish and bringing him and his gang to justice. But he realizes that to succeed, he must allow the outlaws to think they killed all of the Rangers; thus, Reid dons a mask, made from the bullet-riddled vest of his brother, and becomes the Lone Ranger.\n   \n \n    Like most hit radio dramas of the day, \"The Lone Ranger\" was optioned to the movies. Republic Studios bought the rights for a radio serial in 1937, filming a 15-episode series over the span of 19 days late in the year. Each episode was about 17 minutes long, but unlike most serials of the era, this one had relatively high production values, acting and writing. Released early in 1938, it was a hit, and a sequel came out a year later. In the first one, with the Ranger wearing a full-face mask, two different actors, plus a stuntman, actually provided the voice of the Ranger. In the second, actor Robert Livingston played the hero; Livingston was from Illinois and appeared in 135 movies. Tonto was played in both serials by the stuntman and actor known as Chief Thundercloud, who was billed as a University of Arizona-educated Cherokee; his real name was Victor Daniels, who may or may not have been a full-blooded Native American, and no record of his enrollment at UA could ever be confirmed. Trendle was not happy with Republic's handling of the character; the studio had shown Livingston unmasked through most of the second serial, for example, so after that one Trendle terminated the contract and ordered the prints destroyed. Decades later, versions released in Spain with Spanish subtitles were found and painstakingly restored, so they're available to Ranger aficionados today.\n \n \n    Meanwhile, \"The Lone Ranger\" kept riding hard on the radio, with nearly 3000 episodes airing from 1933-54. Several actors voiced the lead role on the radio series, but the two most memorable were Earle Graser (1933-41) and Brace Beemer, who had been the show's narrator but took over the lead role when Graser died of injuries sustained in a car crash; as Graser lingered on his deathbed, the show went on, with the voice of the Ranger reduced to a whisper and Tonto carrying the action. Beemer held the role until the radio series ended in 1954. To maintain the mystery of the character, Graser had never been allowed to do any other radio work, and he had to keep his involvement in the show secret. He wasn't even allowed to make public appearances to promote the show, as many radio stars of the day did; short and pudgy, never on a horse in his life, Graser had to yield the public persona of the character to the taller, more athletic Beemer, who was also an expert horseman. It was said that one time Graser was at a night club with his wife when there was a contest to see who could shout \"Hi-yo, Silver!\" like the Lone Ranger. Graser entered but didn't win. But he was dedicated, doing three live performances of each show, three times a week, and he never missed a show in his eight years as the voice of the Ranger. Like Graser, Beemer was restricted from doing any other radio work while he voiced the character. Throughout the series, Tonto was voiced by John Todd, a white man of Irish descent; at one time a genuine Native American was considered for the role, but the actor, a college-educated man, refused to recite the simplistic, \"me Tonto\"-style dialogue for the character, and Todd kept the job to the end.\n   \n    What most Lone Ranger fans then and now don't know is that the Ranger is connected to another masked avenger that debuted on radio in the 1930s and later made his way to movie serials and TV. The young son of the elder Reid brother later sires a son named Britt, who becomes a newspaper publisher by day...and at night, with his faithful Japanese sidekick Kato, rides the streets in the Black Beauty automobile, fighting crime as the Green Hornet.\n \nThe Green Hornet, played in the 1960s TV series by Van Williams, was originally the Lone Ranger's grand-nephew. And who played the Hornet's sidekick Kato in the TV version? Bruce Lee.\n \n    When the character came to the infant medium of television in 1949, Beemer was not considered for the role because he had no on-screen acting experience. The role instead went to Clayton Moore, a 35-year-old, Chicago-born trapeze artist and model who had served in the Army Air Corps in World War II and appeared in various B-list movies and serials, including such gems as \"Radar Men from the Moon\". Moore modeled his interpretation of the character after Beemer's radio version, and after two seasons of year-round work, making 52 episodes a year, he left the series in a contract dispute. The producers hired John Hart to replace Moore, but the public never really accepted Hart in the role and in '54, Moore was rehired. He stayed with the role for the rest of his life, often appearing as the Ranger in public after the show ceased production in 1957. Tonto was played by Jay Silverheels, a full-blooded Canadian Mohawk who excelled in lacrosse, wrestling and boxing as a young man before getting into acting. Moore and Silverheels reprised their famous roles in two full-length movies, filmed in color and on location.\n \n \n    After the last of the Moore-Silverheels pictures, \"The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold\" was released in 1958, the character could only be seen on TV reruns. By the late '70s, the rights to the character had been sold to producer Jack Wrather, who had produced many of the episodes in the TV series. Wrather was planning a big-screen version of the story and wanted Moore to stop appearing in public as the Lone Ranger, filing a lawsuit to that effect in 1979. It was one of the biggest public relations gaffes in Hollywood history, and probably had a big effect on the failure of the movie to lure decent box office numbers. Although the film was well-written and had beautiful location cinematography, the movie also was hurt by the casting of unknown Klinton Spilsbury as the Lone Ranger. Not only was Spilsbury inexperienced and not as physically-imposing as Moore had been, his voice was so weak that every line of his dialogue in the picture was re-dubbed with the voice of veteran actor James Keach, who didn't even receive credit for his work. As for Spilsbury, he never appeared in another movie.\n \n    James Keach is better known for having married Jane Seymour than being the voice of the Lone Ranger.\n   \n    Yet, when I saw the movie back in 1981 out in the wild Western town of Missoula, Montana, the theater was packed and many of the men who emerged were misty-eyed. Watching it again the other night, I got past the voice dubbing and Spilsbury and appreciated the story. It recreates the origin of the Ranger, only this time the younger Reid, named John, is not a Texas Ranger but a lawyer, just back from law school in the East, joining older brother Dan in the posse to hunt for Cavendish. The outlaw is not just a crook, but a former Union Army major who was court-martialed in the Civil War and now has designs on creating his own dominion in west Texas. To that end, Cavendish (played by Christopher Lloyd) is going to kidnap President Ulysses S. Grant, who is heading through the region on a buffalo hunt, and force Congress to cede the land to him in exchange for the president's life.\n \n    Rescued by Tonto, well-played by Michael Horse, a real Apache, Reid learns to shoot, finds the wild silver stallion and tames him, dons the mask and with Tonto at his side, they ride off to find Cavendish. Merle Haggard provides narration in the picture and a couple songs. Grant is played by Jason Robards, and is accompanied on his train by renowned Old West heroes Wild Bill Hickock, Buffalo Bill Cody and General George A. Custer. I thought that part was certainly a stretch, but what the heck, it's a movie. Without giving away the ending, I will say that it was well-done and exciting. But the movie sank like a stone at the box office and today is regarded as the worst adaptation of the Lone Ranger ever to appear. It was so bad that nobody would touch the property for another 20 years. Then came the publication of a series of graphic novels that were noted for their adherence to Lone Ranger canon and tradition but questioned because of the level of violence. But again, the Old West was a violent place and if there really had been a Lone Ranger, he couldn't have survived long just by trying to shoot the guns out of the bad guy's hands. I have heard that another Ranger movie is in the works. We'll see how they do it this time. At least now they won't have to hassle Clayton Moore, who passed away in 1999 at the age of 85.\n \n   \nWill the recent graphic novelization of the legend lead to a new, better Ranger movie? Stay tuned.\n \n    Several years ago, when my son Jim was about 12, I happened to find a video of \"The Lone Ranger\", the 1956 Clayton Moore feature film. I had never seen it and thought this would be one of those precious moments when the father passes down a family tradition to his son. The movie was great, and during an intense scene when the Ranger is duking it out on top of a rugged plateau with a renegade Apache, I was on the edge of my seat. I glanced over at Jim...and he was fast asleep. So much for tradition.\n \n    What was it about the Lone Ranger that captivates me and my generation so? There were untold numbers of Westerns in those days, in the movies and on TV, all of them with handsome heroes, damsels in distress, snarling bad guys, mighty horses. There was gunplay and fisticuffs aplenty. But the Lone Ranger was different. Was it the mask? Was it the silver bullet, the Ranger's calling card as well as his ammo of choice? Was it his magnificent horse, Silver? His loyal partner Tonto? The Ranger always treated Tonto as an equal, which was a lesson for all of us kids in race relations, even if we didn't realize it, and Tonto was portrayed with great dignity by Silverheels, dispelling many a stereotype that showed the Indian of the Old West as an uncouth savage. \n \n    It was all that, I think, but also this: the Lone Ranger was truly a good guy. He sacrificed everything he could've had in order to pursue the cause of justice. He risked his life to save the innocent. He lived by a code of honor that would've resonated with us even if it hadn't been strictly spelled out for us---but it was:\n       I believe...\n     That to have a friend, a man must be one.\n     That all men are created equal, and everyone has within himself \n        the power to make this a better world.\n      That God put the firewood there, but every man must gather it \n        and light it himself.\n      In being prepared physically, mentally and morally to fight when\n        necessary for that which is right.\n      That a man should make the most of what equipment he has.\n      That this government 'of the people, by the people and for the people'\n        shall live always.\n      That men should live by the rule of what's best for the greatest number.\n      That sooner or later...somewhere...somehow...we must settle with the\n        world and make payment for what we have taken.\n      That all things change but truth, and that truth alone, lives on forever.\n      In my Creator, my country, and my fellow man. \n \n    After seeing the movie, I found this clip on YouTube, put together from the '81 film and set to the classic theme music. If you don't find this stirring, well, then I don't know what will do the trick:\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nThe Lone Ranger is a western TV series that aired on ABC from 1949 until 1957 about the ...

This was by far the highest-rated television program on ABC in the early 1950s and its first true \"hit\".\nJohn Reid had been one of a posse of six Texas Rangers tracking a gang of desperadoes. The Rangers were lured into an ambush in a canyon, and five of them were killed. The sixth, young John Reid, after being left for dead, was found and nursed back to health by a friendly Indian named Tonto. Reid had once helped Tonto and the Indian now vowed to stay with him and the \"lone\" Ranger sought to avenge the deaths of his comrades. Avenge they did, cornering the outlaw Butch Cavendish in a dramatic battle. Reid buried his past at the graves of the five dead Rangers, donned a mask, and set out with Tonto to avenge wrongs throughout the Old West.\nCast & Characters\nClayton Moore as John Reid/The Lone Ranger (1949-1952, 1954-1957)\nJohn Hart as John Reid/The Lone Ranger (1952-1954)\nJay Silverheels as Tonto\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\n... we return to the thrilling days of yesteryear ... of a profile of the Lone Ranger for the series ... Return with us now to those thrilling days ... The Man Behind The Mask: A Profile Of The Lone Ranger The Man Behind The Mask: A Profile Of The Lone Ranger : NPR\nInspired by the recent release of the movie The Lone Ranger, we return to the thrilling days of yesteryear — 2008 — for an encore broadcast of a profile of the Lone Ranger for the series \"In Character.\"\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\nIt's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Audie Cornish.\nMy colleague, Robert Siegel, is off today for the holiday. But, we're going to return with him now to a thrilling day of yesteryear. Yesteryear being five years ago. That's right it's a shameless re-run. And our excuse is the new \"Lone Ranger\" movie, which has opened to mixed reviews. The old TV show, which aired in the 1950s, was a favorite of Robert's when he was a boy. So, for our 2008 series, In Character, Robert marked \"The Lone Ranger's\" 75th anniversary.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nFRED FOY: Look up there at the headwall.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\nIn 1874, six Texas Rangers were betrayed by a guide and ambushed at Bryant's Gap.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nFOY: It's an ambush, men. Slow down and find cover quick.\n(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOTS AND A NEIGHING HORSE)\nSIEGEL: Writhing on the canyon floor, they came under rifle fire from a gang of outlaws on the cliffs above.\n(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOTS)\nSIEGEL: Five died, the sixth was left for dead and would have died that day but for an amazing coincidence. After the shooting was over, an Indian man happened upon the scene of the ambush.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nJAY SILVERHEELS: (as Tonto) Be still. Him not hurt you.\nSIEGEL: The ranger who was wounded but still clinging to life had saved that Indian from outlaw raiders for a few years earlier, when the two were just boys.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nSILVERHEELS: (as Tonto) Why you - you Kemosabe.\nCLAYTON MOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) Kemosabe? That sounds familiar.\nSIEGEL: The Indian recognized his voice companion, carried into a nearby cave and nursed him back to health.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) The other rangers, Tonto, all dead?\nSILVERHEELS: (as Tonto) Mmm.\nSIEGEL: Including Captain Dan Reid, the Ranger's own brother. The Indian did the subtraction.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nSILVERHEELS: (as Tonto) You all alone now, last man. You are lone ranger.\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) Yes, Tonto, I am a lone ranger.\n(SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC)\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: The Lone Ranger...\nSIEGEL: He has been The Lone Ranger ever since. On radio, in movies, in novels, on television, in comic books, his story has been embroidered, embellished and rewritten. But he always wore a mask, he always pursued justice and he never accepted praise or payment.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) Hi-yo, Silver, away.\nFRAN STRIKER, JR.: Well, my name is Fran Striker, Jr. And my father's name was Fran Striker and he was the creator and author of \"The Lone Ranger.\"\nSIEGEL: In 1933, Fran Striker - a self-described hack writer - was in Buffalo, New York, writing radio scripts for, among other stations, WXYZ in Detroit.\nJR.: And they were buying five programs a week from him. Some of them were mystery series. Some of them were Secret Service series.\nSIEGEL: And the owner of WXYZ, George Trendle, wanted a Western. Fran Striker started writing and, over the course of a dozen episodes, a character took shape - a paragon of virtue.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) I'll shoot to wound, not to kill. A man must die, it's up to the Lord to decide that; not the person behind the six shooter.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: May I offer you gentlemen to drink?\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) No, thanks. A man drinks that kind of medicine to forget something he does want to remember.\nJR.: The Lone Ranger always used dead-on perfect English. That's what George Trendle read the scripts for.\nSIEGEL: He didn't even have a hint of a Texas accent about him, as he spoke.\nJR.: Well, nobody has been west of Buffalo or Detroit, either.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\n(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) (Unintelligible) open the door, sheriff.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: A masked man.\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) Back inside.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: You've got a lot of nerve.\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) Don't make a move for your guns...\nGARY HOPPENSTAND: My name is Gary Hoppenstand and I am a professor of American Studies, who specializes in popular culture studies. And I am also currently editor of the Journal of Popular Culture, which is the largest scholarly journal of its type in the world.\nSIEGEL: Professor Hoppenstand ranks The Lone Ranger among a handful of important iconic figures in American popular culture. A vigilante lawman who protects the criminal justice system by working outside it, a hero made for radio audiences of the Great Depression.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (as Jim) I reckon we ain't no choice but to sell out of this polecat I tried to find new begin somewhere.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: A hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of cash, Jim.\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Don't you take it, Jim. What will we do when the 150 is gone? We won't have enough then, not even this house and the clean.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: (as Jim) All right.\nHOPPENSTAND: In the 1930s, the perception was that there was a failure of government to protect the American people. And so, this is a character - masked - who use vigilante techniques to basically protect those who can't help themselves. And so, this was a character who found a decided audience, experiencing those kinds of things in their daily lives, while also having been wonderful escapist enjoyment, as well.\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BOB DYLAN'S BLUES\")\nBOB DYLAN: (Singing) Well, The Lone Ranger and Tonto, they're riding down the line, fixing everybody's troubles, everybody's except mine...\nSIEGEL: For the first 10 episodes of \"The Lone Ranger,\" the Ranger actually rode alone. This was before they cooked up the back-story of the ambush at Bryant's Gap. As writer Fran Striker told us son, Fran Jr., that posed a problem for creating dialogue.\nJR.: The problem being that The Lone Ranger had nobody to talk to, if he was a lone ranger. So they had suggested that the creative sidekick for The Lone Ranger. Script 11 introduced Tonto, and he was developed solely for the purpose of giving the Lone Ranger somebody to talk to.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) All right, Tonto, you'll be a lot of help. We'll ride together.\nSILVERHEELS: (as Tonto) Me glad, Kemosabe. Me fight good for you.\n(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOTS)\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) Take cover, Tonto.\nMARK ELLIS: I always loved The Lone Ranger is like your idealized white man. And Tonto is your idealized Native American.\nSIEGEL: Writer Mark Ellis compiled the fictional timeline of The Lone Ranger's life.\nELLIS: As a kid, my idea of a Native American was based on basically Tonto, who was a good person. He was very moral. He was very smart even if he spoke rather broken English.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nSILVERHEELS: (as Tonto) Me call you Kemosabe. That means Trusty Scout.\nJR.: If The Lone Ranger accepts the Indian as his closest companion, it's obvious to the child listener that great men have no racial or religious prejudice.\nSIEGEL: Fran Striker, Jr. says in all \"The Lone Ranger\" episodes there is never a disparaging word about any minority group. Of course, what had sufficed as racial equality in 1933 could easily provoke cynicism by the time the show was on television in the 1950s or in reruns in the '60s.\nAgain, Mark Ellis.\nELLIS: Bill Cosby used to do a routine where he could never understand why Lone Ranger would always send Tonto into town for supplies, and then would get beaten up.\nBILL COSBY: And I'd always holler at the radio: Tonto, don't go to town.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCOSBY: They're going to beat you up again, man.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCOSBY: You know, just one time: Tonto. Yes, Kemosabe. You go to town. You go to hell, Kemosabe.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"YOU DON'T MESS AROUND WITH JIM\")\nJIM CROCE: (Singing) Just because and they say you don't tug on Superman's cape. You don't spit into the wind. You don't pull the mask on that old Lone Ranger. And you don't mess around with Jim. Ah-do-dah-do-dah-dah...\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) I'll hide my identity somehow.\nSILVERHEELS: (as Tonto) You mean like mask?\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) That's it, Tonto. From now on, I'll wear a mask.\nSIEGEL: Why the mask? Well, the idea was that the Butch Cavendish Gang - the bad guys who had killed his comrades in the ambush - shouldn't know that one of them had survived and was out to seek revenge.\nTERRY SALOMONSON: And in order to keep his identity secret, he used a mask and never used his name, so he could go after the gang. The mask is, as the legend goes, was cut from his dead brother's vest.\nSIEGEL: That's Terry Salomonson, lifelong fan and collector of \"Lone Ranger\" memorabilia. Of course, that doesn't explain why he always wore the mask, even when he and Tonto were riding alone across the Texas wilderness.\nSALOMONSON: Over caution.\nSIEGEL: Over caution.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) No one is going to know I'm alive. I'm supposed to be dead and I'm going to stay that way.\nHOPPENSTAND: He wears a mask that is the very symbol of the outlaws that the Lone Rangers go after.\nSIEGEL: Professor Gary Hoppenstand.\nHOPPENSTAND: I think what it plays into is the audience's sense of escapist fantasy. The idea is that in their imagination all they need to do is don their own mask and they, too, could have the sort of grand and exciting adventures, where they're doing exciting and good things.\nSIEGEL: So who actually knew The Lone Ranger's face? Well, his nephew did and, of course, Tonto did. And, this may be surprising, but President Ulysses S. Grant did.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) Mr. President.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: (as President Ulysses S. Grant) Who are you? Who let you come in here with that mask on your face? Take it off if you want to speak to me.\nSIEGEL: Terry Salomonson explains this encounter.\nSALOMONSON: President Grant summoned him to a railroad siding in St. Louis because of the actions of a particular group of individuals that were trying to carve out their own country, so to speak, in the West. And that started off a 64-episode series entitled \"The Legion of the Black Arrow.\" And President Grant requested that the Lone Ranger come in for a meeting to say is there something we can do, and how can you fight against it.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) There.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: (as President Ulysses S. Grant) You know, your face is just what I thought it would be. What I hoped it would be.\nMOORE: (as The Lone Ranger) Thank you, sir.\nSIEGEL: The Lone Ranger was a patriot - in real life, too.\nAgain, Fran Striker, Jr., son of the writer.\nFRAN STRIKER JR.: Interestingly, during World War II, my father was called to Washington by the War Department and they had a favor. He had a number of Ranger programs where the Lone Ranger would help the Calvary out at the end of the program. And the War Department thought that it would be nice if the Calvary could help the Lone Ranger out.\n(LAUGHTER)\nJR.: And that was their PR effort for the year, I guess. And dad said, of course.\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG)\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: (singing) The adventure of Lone Ranger and Tonto, that masked alias rider. Hi-yo, Silver, away...\nSIEGEL: Something else about the Lone Ranger, he rode a white stallion named Silver and his six-shooter fired silver bullets.\nMICHAEL CHABON: Gotta love the silver bullets. The silver bullets are genius.\nSIEGEL: That's novelist Michael Chabon.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LONE RANGER\")\nMOORE: (As Lone Ranger) Silver bullets will serve as sort of a symbol. Tonto suggested the idea. A symbol which means justice by law.\nSIEGEL: It didn't hurt that the Lone Ranger had inherited a silver mine. Writer Mark Ellis says these props were designed to be indelible in the mind's eye.\nMIKE ELLIS: The silver bullets, the mask and the white stallion, Silver, those were what was known, I guess, in the old days of radio as shiny things for the mind so that the imagination could latch onto and made it easier to visualize the characters and the places.\nSIEGEL: And people did. Time was, kids had Lone Ranger rings, hats, masks, Lone Ranger giveaways from cereal boxes. Novelist Michael Chabon says the charm still works.\nCHABON: My 4-year-old son and I just stumbled upon some books we have from the 1950s. We have two Lone Ranger Golden Books and my son was just immediately enrapt. There's something about the mask and the hat and the horse and the silver bullets and the faithful Indian friend. And there's something really powerful there in that character.\nI mean, there's some reason why the Lone Ranger continues to endure, even though he's far less visible now than he once was.\nFOY: We never dreamed that this would become a legend when we were doing the show.\nSIEGEL: Fred Foy is 86. In 1948, he got the job at WXYZ in Detroit to be the announcer on \"The Lone Ranger\" and he filled the same job on the TV show that followed.\nFOY: And it's so beautiful to know that you had so many people who sat back and enjoyed your work. And I'm very flattered to hear that.\nSIEGEL: I was wondering if you could give us up in the clear, a rendering of the opening.\nFOY: The opening. Okay. And that includes all of it. All right. Let's see what happens here. A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-yo Silver. The Lone Ranger, with his faithful Indian companion, Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early Western United States. Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice.\nReturn with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. From out of the past comes the thundering hoof beats of the great horse, Silver. The Lone Ranger rides again. Hi-yo, Silver, away.\nSIEGEL: You have the magical power to make people feel they're five years old once again.\nFOY: Oh, well, thank you.\nSIEGEL: That was announcer Fred Foy back in 2008. Foy died three years ago. Everyone else I mentioned is five years older now, including the Lone Ranger. He's 80.\nCopyright © 2013 NPR.  All rights reserved.
