What determines the boiling point of water? Here's the answer to this common question.\nAnswer: The boiling point of water is 100°C or 212° F at 1 atmosphere of pressure (sea level).\nHowever, the value is not a constant. The boiling point of water depends on the atmospheric pressure, which changes according to elevation. The boiling point of water is 100°C or 212° F at 1 atmosphere of pressure (sea level), but water boils at a lower temperature as you gain altitude (e.g., on a mountain) and boils at a higher temperature if you increase atmospheric pressure (lived below sea level ).\nThe boiling point of water also depends on the purity of the water. Water which contains impurities (such as salted water ) boils at a higher temperature than pure water. This phenomenon is called boiling point elevation , which is one of the colligative properties of matter.\nLearn More\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nHi Maria, For pure water, the boiling point is 100 degrees Celsius (212 Fahrenheit) at one atmosphere of pressure, and the melting point is 0 degrees Celsius (32 ... Q & A: Boiling and Freezing points of pure and salty water ... Q & A: Boiling and Freezing points of pure and salty water | Department of Physics | University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nQ & A: Boiling and Freezing points of pure and salty water\nLearn more physics!\nWhat is the boiling and freezing point of both fresh and saltwater?\n- maria  (age 13)\ncongress middle, lake worth , F.L., Florida\nA:\nHi Maria,\nFor pure water, the boiling point is 100 degrees Celsius (212 Fahrenheit) at one atmosphere of pressure, and the melting point is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at one atmosphere of pressure. At lower pressures (at high altitudes, for example, in Denver, Colorado), the boiling point will be perhaps a couple of degrees lower.\nFor saltwater, the boiling point is raised, and the melting point is lowered. By how much depends on how much salt there is. I'll assume the salt is sodium chloride, NaCl (table salt). The melting point is lowered by 1.85 degrees Celsius if 29.2 grams of salt are dissolved in each Kg of water (called a \"0.5 molal solution\" of salt. The Na and Cl dissociate right away when dissolved, and so for a 0.5 molal solution of salt, there is a 1.0 molal concentration of ions). The boiling point is raised by 0.5 degrees Celsius for water with 29.2 grams of salt dissolved in each kg of water.\nIf your concentrations of salt are different, then you can scale the boiling point elevation and melting point depression predictions directly with the concentration.\nThese numbers come from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.\nTom\nNaestved, denmark\nA:\nYou're basically right. Either way you start out with plain water and salt at room temperature. The noodles go in when you have salty water at its boiling point. The energy difference between that and the starting point doesn't depend on when you add the salt.\nA little energy is lost to evaporation on the way, however. If you wait until the water is boiling, then add salt, then boil again, the water is spending a little more time near boiling than it would if you add the salt first. So you lose a little more energy. It's marginally more efficient to add the salt first.\nMike W.\nOverland Park KS, USA\nA:\nI use that sort of humidifier. Adding salt does work. The heating comes from the electrical current flowing through the water. Tap water has a pretty low conductivity, so not much current flows. Adding salt raises the conductivity, since the ions are electrically charged. You actually have to be a bit careful not to add too much salt, since you don't want to blow a fuse.\n The effects on the boiling point are very minor compared to the effects on the conductivity. \nBTW, although these humidifiers are cheap they do have the nice advantage that since they output water vapor, not drops, you don's have to worry about bacteria etc. getting sprayed into the air.\nMike W.\n\n"
