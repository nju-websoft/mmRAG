These algae blooms (a.k.a \"red tide\") might look disgusting during the day, but in parts of California and other places where the bioluminescent variety of Noctiluca scintillans bloom, red tide nights look out of this world. This particular variety of phytoplankton glows blue when agitated, transforming the dark ocean into a giant lava lamp. Watch the waves light up as they crash, run across the sand to see the ground glow under your feet, or dive in to be surrounded by the bizarre Timex-y glow. N. scintillans is also the culprit behind the Bioluminescent Bays in Puerto Rico . Photo: catalano82\n2\nFoxfire\nDuring the late summer, a faint, eerie glow can be seen in forests around the world, where bioluminescent mushrooms grow on moist, rotting bark. The greatest diversity of foxfire occurs in the tropics, where moist forests encourage fungal growth. The newest varieties of glow-in-the-dark mushrooms were introduced to the world just last year, after being collected from Ribeira Valley Tourist State Park near Sao Paulo, Brazil. To up your chances of seeing this one, hunt in the forest during its wettest season and move as far as possible from any artificial light sources. And f you happen to see a patch of glowing shrooms, don't even think about it -- they're not that kind of mushroom .

Because the fire rainbow actually involves no rain at all, scientists would rather we refer to this occurrence by its much less fun, but much more accurate title: the circumhorizonal arc. Since the arc requires both the presence of cirrus clouds and for the sun to be extremely high in the sky, it's much more likely to be seen at latitudes closer to the equator. Conditions might be right for a fire rainbow in Los Angeles six months out of the year, but in a more northern city like London, that window drops to a mere two months. The photo above was taken in West Virginia . Photo: Jeff Kubina\nIntermission\n4\nNacreous clouds\nFor those of you a bit farther away from the equator, there's still plenty to see in the sky.  Nacreous clouds (also called mother-of-pearl clouds) are extremely rare, but unmistakeable in the dark hours before dawn or after sunset.  Because of their extremely high altitudes, they reflect sunlight from below the horizon, shining it down brightly, in stark comparison to the regular ol' dark clouds in the troposphere. The lower stratosphere, where nacreous clouds live, is so dry that it often prevents cloud formation, but the extreme cold of polar winters makes this beautiful phenomenon possible. Captured best during winter at high latitudes, nacreous clouds have been spotted in Iceland , Alaska, Northern Canada, and very rarely, farther south in England. Photo: Thomas Larsen RÃ¸ed\n5\nSnow rollers\nSnow rollers are formed when a thick layer of snow falls on top of a layer of ice.  If the temperature and wind speed are right, chunks of snow can break loose and start rolling.  As they're blown along the ground like wintry tumbleweeds, they pick up additional snow along the way.  The inner layers are often weaker and less compact, allowing them to be blown easily away by the wind, leaving a large, naturally formed snow donut. Because of the precise temperature and wind speeds required to create this effect, snow rollers are a rare sight, but have made headlines with their appearances in parts of North America and the UK . Photo: jah~\n6\nColumnar basalt\nA natural volcanic formation, columnar basalt has a seemingly man-made appearance.  The (mostly) hexagonal columns form naturally as thick lava rapidly cools, contracting and creating cracks in the surface of the new rock. These unusual geological formations can be seen across the globe.  Two of the most notable examples include the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and Devil's Postpile in California (pictured above). Photo: dwolfgra\n7\nRaining animals\nThis phenomenon has been reported in locations worldwide for centuries, with most cases involving fish, frogs, or other small aquatic animals. Despite being extremely rare and lacking in credible eyewitness accounts, most incidents are explainable. Waterspouts (think tornadoes made of water) are the go-to culprit, as their high winds are capable of lifting small animals out of the water, carrying them far distances before dropping them unceremoniously on your head. Considering this, I'd recommend heading closer to large bodies of water during an extremely heavy storm to increase odds of bearing witness to this truly bizarre phenomenon.  But, seriously, bring a poncho or something. Photo: Matthew Hoelscher\n8\nAsperatus clouds\nAsperatus clouds are so rare they managed to escape classification until 2009.  Ominous and stormy as they appear, these clouds often break up rather quickly, without producing a storm.  As with most other undulating cloud types, these clouds are formed when turbulent winds or colliding air masses whip up the bottoms of the cloud layer into fancy shapes and formations. More common in the plains of the United States (try Iowa ), asperatus clouds are at their weird and swirly best during the morning or midday hours after a thunderstorm. Photo: B.J. Bumgarner\n9\nGreen flash\nThe famed and elusive Green Flash is a rare meteorological phenomenon that occurs at sunset and sunrise.  During these times, the sun's light travels through more of the earth's atmosphere to reach your eye, creating a prism effect.  Yeah, the explanation is definitely more dull than many of the maritime legends surrounding the phenomenon, but consider yourself very lucky if you're able to witness this event. To increase your chances, watch the sun set (or rise) over a long and uninterrupted horizon on a very clear day.  The ocean horizon works well for this, as will a prairie, or the horizon line while inside an airplane.  The flash lasts only a fraction of a second, so don't blink! Photo: Mila Zinkova\nIntermission\n10\nSun dogs\nWhen the sun is near the horizon and ice crystals are present in the air, look up to see a pair of bright spots sitting on either side of the sun.  Always to the right and the left along the horizon line, these dogs loyally follow the sun across the sky. While this atmospheric phenomenon can occur whenever, wherever , the effect is usually quite subtle.  When sunlight passes through cirrus clouds (or other types of ice clouds) at just the right angle, however, these spots can appear as bright as the sun itself.  The brightest occur when the sun is low in the sky in colder regions.  This photo shows a sun dog at the South Pole. Photo: Lt. Cindy McFee\n11\nDouble rainbow\nIf there were any atmospheric phenomenon that could bring a grown man to tears , it's this one. So, \"WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!?!?!?\" Well, it means pretty much the same thing as a regular rainbow. Only, on occasion, sunlight reflects in a raindrop not once, but twice, creating a secondary rainbow outside of the much brighter primary arc. The best views of this phenomenon occur when the sky is still dark with rainclouds, as the gray background helps the much dimmer colors of the secondary arc appear.  Double rainbow, all the way! Photo: Tim Kelley\n12\nStriped iceberg\nIcebergs aren't exclusively monotone.  A few nonconformists come in various colored stripes, standing out against arctic whites and blues.  As water melts and refreezes on an iceberg over time, dirt and other particles can become trapped between new layers of ice, creating multicolored stripes across its surface. A variety of colors can appear.  Blue stripes occur when water gets trapped between layers of ice and freezes so quickly that air bubbles cannot form.  Once icebergs break off and fall into the ocean, algae or other materials present in the water can create green or yellow stripes. Up your chances of viewing striped bergs by heading south to Antarctica . Photo: Jeff McNeill\n13\nCatatumbo lightning\nStill a relatively mysterious occurrence, the Catatumbo lighting in Venezuela is known as the everlasting storm.  The seemingly non-stop cloud-to-cloud lightning can be easily seen from a distance, and has long been celebrated for its ability to assist sailors with navigation. Since the Catatumbo lighting does its thing approximately 140-160 nights per year, your chances of viewing it are quite good.  It occurs very specifically in one area -- the mouth of the Catatumbo River and around Maracaibo Lake. Photo: Thechemicanengineer\n14\nGravity wave\nWaves apparently aren't restricted to large bodies of water or the stands at sporting events -- they can happen, albeit rarely, in the sky as well.  When air is pushed up into a more stable layer of atmosphere, it can cause a ripple effect, just like tossing a rock into a pond. For a gravity wave to occur, there must be a disturbance in the atmosphere, such as an updraft of a thunderstorm.  Recent studies indicate that gravity waves have the power to concentrate and intensify tornados, so if you're lucky (or unlucky) enough to view the undulating cloud formations firsthand, I'd suggest seeking shelter soon after! Iowa would be a good place to start the hunt.

Erosion uncovers these giants, but it isn't responsible for their spherical shape.  Instead, these boulders are said to have been created millions of years ago on the ocean floor in a process similar to the formation of oyster pearls -- layers of sediment and material crystallizing around a central core.  Over the course of millions of years, they grew to the immense sizes seen today. The boulders can be found on Koekohe Beach, New Zealand.

(Natural Phenomena ) Topics ... local houses and all kind of animals. 7 Incredible Natural Phenomena you've never seen (Natural ... 7 Incredible Natural Phenomena you've never seen (Natural Phenomena ) - ODDEE\n7 Incredible Natural Phenomena you've never seen\n11/16/2007\n1\nVenezuela's Everlasting Storm\nThe mysterious \"Relámpago del Catatumbo\" (Catatumbo lightning) is a unique natural phenomenon in the world. Located on the mouth of the Catatumbo river at Lake Maracaibo (Venezuela), the phenomenon is a cloud-to-cloud lightning that forms a voltage arc more than five kilometre high during 140 to 160 nights a year, 10 hours a night, and as many as 280 times an hour. This almost permanent storm occurs over the marshlands where the Catatumbo River feeds into Lake Maracaibo and it is considered the greatest single generator of ozone in the planet, judging from the intensity of the cloud-to-cloud discharge and great frequency.\nThe area sees an estimated 1,176,000 electrical discharges per year, with an intensity of up to 400,000 amperes, and visible up to 400 km away. This is the reason why the storm is also known as the Maracaibo Beacon as light has been used for navigation by ships for ages. The collision with the winds coming from the Andes Mountains causes the storms and associated lightning, a result of electrical discharges through ionised gases, specifically the methane created by the decomposition of organic matter in the marshes. Being lighter than air, the gas rises up to the clouds, feeding the storms. Some local environmentalists hope to put the area under the protection of UNESCO, as it is an exceptional phenomenon, the greatest source of its type for regenerating the planet's ozone layer.\n2\nHonduras' Rain of Fishes\nThe Rain of Fish is common in Honduran Folklore. It occurs in the Departamento de Yoro, between the months of May and July. Witnesses of this phenomenon state that it begins with a dark cloud in the sky followed by lightning, thunder, strong winds and heavy rain for 2 to 3 hours. Once the rain has stopped, hundreds of living fish are found on the ground. People take the fish home to cook and eat them. Since 1998 a festival known as \"Festival de la Lluvia de Peces\" (Rain of Fish Festival) is celebrated every year in the city of Yoro, Departamento de Yoro, Honduras.\n3\nMorocco's Climbing Goats\nGoats on trees are found mostly only in Morocco. The goats climb them because they like to eat the fruit of the argan tree, which is similar to an olive. Farmers actually follow the herds of goats as they move from tree to tree. Not because it is so strange to see goats in trees and the farmers like to point and stare, but because the fruit of the tree has a nut inside, which the goats can't digest, so they spit it up or excrete it which the farmers collect. The nut contains 1-3 kernels, which can be ground to make argan oil used in cooking and cosmetics. This oil has been collected by the people of the region for hundreds of years, but like many wild and useful things these days, the argan tree is slowly disappearing due to over-harvesting for the tree's wood and overgrazing by goats.\nAs a result a group of people and organizations have banded together to try to save the tree. To do so one of the primary locations where the trees grow has been declared a biosphere preserve. It was also decided that by making the world aware of the oil, it's great taste and supposed anti-aging properties, would create a demand for it. However, the people who planned to market the oil could not envision people wanting to put an oil on their food or their face that was collected from goat excrement. As a result, a campaign is being led to ban grazing on the trees by goats during certain parts of the year to allow the fruit to ripen and fall off on its own. The fruit is then collected and turned into oil by oil cooperatives. So far, this arrangement seems to be working.\n4\nKerala's (extraterrestrial?) Red Rain\nFrom 25 July to 23 September 2001, red rain sporadically fell on the southern Indian state of Kerala. Heavy downpours occurred in which the rain was coloured red, staining clothes with an appearance similar to that of blood. Yellow, green, and black rain was also reported.\nIt was initially suspected that the rains were coloured by fallout from a hypothetical meteor burst, but a study commissioned by the Government of India found that the rains had been coloured by airborne spores from a locally prolific terrestrial alga. Then in early 2006, the coloured rains of Kerala suddenly rose to worldwide attention after media reports of a conjecture that the coloured particles were extraterrestrial cells, proposed by Godfrey Louis and Santhosh Kumar of the Mahatma Gandhi University in Kottayam. The terrestrial origins of the solid material in the red rain were supported by an investigation into the isotopic ratios of nitrogen and carbon.\n5\nBrazilian's longest wave on the Earth\nTwice a year, between the months of February and March, the Atlantic Ocean waters roll up the Amazon river, in Brazil, generating the longest wave on the Earth. The phenomenon, known as the Pororoca, is caused by the tides of the Atlantic Ocean wich meet the mouth of the river. This tidal bore generates waves up to 12 feet high which can last for over half an hour.\nThe name \"Pororoca\" comes from the indigenous Tupi language, where it translates into \"great destructive noise\". The wave can be heard about 30 minutes before its arrival, and it's so powerful that it can destroy anything, including trees, local houses and all kind of animals.\nThe wave has become popular with surfers. Since 1999, an annual championship has been held in São Domingos do Capim. However, surfing the Pororoca is especially dangerous, as the water contains a significant amount of debris from the margins of the river (often, entire trees). The record that we could find for surfing the longest distance on the Pororoca was set by Picuruta Salazar, a brazilian surfer who, in 2003, managed to ride the wave for 37 minutes and travel 12.5 kilometers. A surfer's dream: riding an almost never-ending wave.\n6\nDenmark's  Black Sun\nDuring spring in Denmark, at approximately one half an hour before sunset, flocks of more than a million European starlings (sturnus vulgaris) gather from all corners to join in the incredible formations shown above. This phenomenon is called Black Sun (in Denmark), and can be witnessed in early spring throughout the marshlands of western Denmark, from March through to the middle of April. The starlings migrate from the south and spend the day in the meadows gathering food, sleeping in the reeds during the night.\n7\nIdaho's Fire Rainbow\nThe atmospheric phenomenon known as a circumhorizon(tal) arc, or \"Fire rainbow\", appears when the sun is high in the sky (i.e., higher than 58° above the horizon), and its light passes through diaphanous, high-altitude cirrus clouds made up of hexagonal plate crystals.  Sunlight entering the crystals' vertical side faces and leaving through their bottom faces is refracted (as through a prism) and separated into an array of visible colors.  When the plate crystals in cirrus clouds are aligned optimally (i.e., with their faces parallel to the ground), the resulting display is a brilliant spectrum of colors reminiscent of a rainbow. The example shown above was captured on camera as it hung for about an hour across a several-hundred square mile area of sky above northern Idaho (near the Washington border) on 3 June 2006.\nFrom the Web\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nMeander Formation and ... floodplain and form natural ... A meandering stream migrates laterally by sediment erosion on the outside of the meander ... Meander Formation and Features of Meandering Streams Meander Formation and Features of Meandering Streams\nMeander Formation and Features of Meandering Streams\n \nFormation of natural levees by spill-over of sediment during floods.   Next to the channel mostly sand is deposited (highest flow velocities), and sand     compacts less than the mud that is deposited farther away.  Thus, over time these     near-channel sand deposits will over time rise above the (more compacted) floodplain and     form natural levees.\nOverview of features associated with meandering streams. A     meandering stream migrates laterally by sediment erosion on the outside of the meander     (that is part of the friction work), and deposition on the inside (helicoidal flow,     deceleration, channel lag, point bar sequence, fining upwards). Adjacent to the     channel levee deposits build up, and gradually raise up the river over the floodplain (mainly fine sediments). If the climate is humid the floodplain area beyond the levees may     be covered with water most of the time, and may form a swamp (backswamp). Rivers     that want to enter the main stream may not make it up the levee, and empty either into the     backswamp (filing it up gradually) or flow parallel to the stream for a long distance     until they finally join (yazoo streams). Meanders may cut into each other as they     grow (neck cutoffs), and then the river shortcuts (growing meanders reduce the     slope, cutoffs are a means to increase the slope again, feedback loop) and the old meander     is abandoned and slowly fills with fine sediment during floods (oxbow lakes). Also,     as a river builds up its levees and raises itself over the floodplain, the slope and the     transport power of the stream decrease, the channel fills gradually with sediment, and     finally (often during a flood) the river will breach its levee (this process is called avulsion)     and follow a steeper path down the valley.\nHow meanders grow laterally through erosion (outside bend) and     sediment deposition (inside bend, point bar).  When the loops get too large and     consume too much energy (friction), the river will eventually find a less energetically \"taxing\" shortcut, and a part of the old channel will be abandoned and becomes     an oxbow lake.\nAir photos of meandering streams. These photos show numerous     abandoned channel segements or oxbow lakes.  Oxbow lakes that are filled up with     sediments still show up on photos through different vegetation patterns (soil differences)     and are called \"meander scars\".\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\n18 Amazing And Surreal Natural Phenomena That Occur On Earth. ... a type of limestone. ...

Thanks to this Quora thread.\nFlickr: 78134895@N03 / Creative Commons\n \nRunning through the island of Mindanao in the Philippines, the Enchanted River (real name: Hinatuan River) is not only a beautiful body of water, but a stunning natural mystery — no one knows exactly where the river comes from. Although the river’s source is undetermined, it is still a popular destination for swimmers and divers alike.\nFlickr: gratapictures / Creative Commons\n \nThe frozen bubbles that appear when Abraham Lake freezes over look beautiful, but could potentially be very dangerous. That’s because the bubbles aren’t air bubbles, but rather, methane bubbles, which wikipedia notes “may form explosive mixtures with air” due to methane’s flammability.\nwanderluster / thinkstockphotos.com\n \nThe world’s largest salt flat, Salar de Uyuni was created when a prehistoric salt lake in the region dried up. During the rainy season, the salt is coated in a thin layer of water (as the rainwater has nowhere to drain ), creating a mirror effect that stretches across the flat and provides stunning images of the sky and clouds.\ngreenantphoto / thinkstockphotos.com\n \nIncluding Hillier Lake and the aptly named Pink Lake, the pink lakes of Western Australia get their color, it is suspected, from dyes created by the bacteria that live in the lakes or the presence of a high concentration of algae.\nFlickr: neo_ii / Creative Commons\n \nThe Green Lake , or Grüner See, is located in the village of Tragöß, Austria and seems normal at first glance. However, that glance depends on what time of year you see the lake. During the frozen winter, the lake is mostly dry and becomes a popular spot for hikers in the region. However, when the temperatures rise, ice and snow on the nearby mountaintops begins to melt and fill the lake, covering up the grass, trees, and benches that had been visible only months before.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\n... most interesting natural phenomena on earth.

This phenomenon ocurrs when the sun gives off high-energy charged particles (also called ions) that travel out into space at speeds of 300 to 1200 kilometres per second. A cloud of such particles is called a plasma. The stream of plasma coming from the sun is known as the solar wind. As the solar wind interacts with the edge of the earth’s magnetic field, some of the particles are trapped by it and they follow the lines of magnetic force down into the ionosphere, the section of the earth’s atmosphere that extends from about 60 to 600 kilometers above the earth’s surface. When the particles collide with the gases in the ionosphere they start to glow, producing the spectacle that we know as the auroras, northern and southern.\n2\nMammatus Clouds\nAlso known as mammatocumulus, meaning \"bumpy clouds\", they are a cellular pattern of pouches hanging underneath the base of a cloud. Composed primarily of ice, Mammatus Clouds can extend for hundreds of miles in each direction, while individual formations can remain visibly static for ten to fifteen minutes at a time. True to their ominous appearance, mammatus clouds are often harbingers of a coming storm or other extreme weather system.\n3\nRed Tides\nMore correctly known as an algal bloom, the so-called Red tide is a natural event in which estuarine, marine, or fresh water algae accumulate rapidly in the water column and can convert entire areas of an ocean or beach into a blood red color. This phenomena is caused by high levels of phytoplankton accumulating to form dense, visible clouds near the surface of the water. While some of these can be relatively harmless, others can be harbingers of deadly toxins that cause the deaths of fish, birds and marine mammals. In some cases, even humans have been harmed by red tides though no human exposure are known to have been fatal. While they can be fatal, the constituent phytoplankton in ride tides are not harmful in small numbers.\n4\nPenitentes\nThese amazing ice spikes, generally known as penitentes due to their resemblance to processions of white-hooded monks, can be found on mountain glaciers and vary in size dramatically: from a few centimetres to 5 metres in height. Initially, the sun’s rays cause random dimples on the surface of the snow. Once such a dimple is formed, sunlight can be reflected within the dimple, increasing the localized sublimation. As this accelerates, deep troughs are formed, leaving peaks of ice standing between them.\n5\nSailing Stones\nThe mysterious moving stones of the packed-mud desert of Death Valley have been a center of scientific controversy for decades. Rocks weighing up to hundreds of pounds have been known to move up to hundreds of yards at a time. Some scientists have proposed that a combination of strong winds and surface ice account for these movements. However, this theory does not explain evidence of different rocks starting side by side and moving at different rates and in disparate directions. Moreover, the physics calculations do not fully support this theory as wind speeds of hundreds of miles per hour would be needed to move some of the stones.\n6\nSupercells\nSupercell is the name given to a continuously rotating updraft deep within a severe thunderstorm (a mesocyclone) and looks downright scary. They are usually isolated storms, which can last for hours, and sometimes can split in two, with one storm going to the left of the wind and one to the right. They can spout huge amounts of hail, rain and wind and are often responsible for tornados, though they can also occur without tornados. Supercells are often carriers of giant hailstones and although they can occur anywhere in the world they’re most frequent in the Great Plains of the US.\n7\nFire Whirls\nA fire whirl , also known as fire devil or fire tornado, is a rare phenomenon in which a fire, under certain conditions --depending on air temperature and currents--, acquires a vertical vorticity and forms a whirl, or a tornado-like effect of a vertically oriented rotating column of air. Fire whirls often occur during bush fires. Vertical rotating columns of fire form when the air currents and temperature are just right, creating a tornado-like effect. They can be as high as 30 to 200 ft tall and up to 10 ft wide but only last a few minutes, although some can last for longer if the winds are strong.\n8\nIce Circles\nA rare phenomenon usually only seen in extremely cold countries, scientists generally accept that Ice Circles are formed when surface ice gathers in the center of a body of water rather than the edges. A slow moving river current can create a slow turning eddy, which rotates, forming an ice disc. Very slowly the edges are ground down until a gap is formed between the eddy and the surrounding ice. These ice circles have been seen with diameters of over 500 feet and can also at times be found in clusters and groups at different sizes.\n9\nGravity Waves\nThe undulating pattern of a Gravity Wave is caused by air displaced in the vertical plain, usually as a result of updrafts coming off the mountains or during thunderstorms. A wave pattern will only be generated when the updraft air is forced into a stable air pocket. The upward momentum of the draft triggers into the air pocket causes changes in the atmosphere, altering the fluid dynamics. Nature then tries to restore the fluid changes within the atmosphere, which present in a visible oscillating pattern within the cloud.

Hums have been reported in various geographical locations. In some cases a source has been located. A well-known case was reported in Taos, New Mexico, and thus the Hum is sometimes called the Taos Hum. They have been reported all over the world, especially in Europe: a Hum on the Big Island of Hawaii, typically related to volcanic action, is heard in locations dozens of miles apart. The Hum is most often described as sounding somewhat like a distant idling diesel engine. Difficult to detect with microphones, its source and nature are unknown.\nFrom the Web\n\n"
