Now Dudley confronts his demons | Film | The Guardian Now Dudley confronts his demons | Film | The Guardian\nNow Dudley confronts his demons\nTV audience of millions watches as comic reveals fears of imminent death\nSunday 21 November 1999 06.24 EST\nFirst published on Sunday 21 November 1999 06.24 EST\nClose\nThis article is 17 years old\nIn his early years as an entertainer, Dudley Moore would amuse his audiences with a rendition of Beethoven's Pathétique - as played by a pianist losing his memory. Bursts of manic tinkling would be interspersed with lengthening bouts of puzzled hesitation and baffled confusion that eventually descended into musical anarchy.\nIt was an amiable, though not necessarily hilarious, routine that perfectly combined Moore's twin talents: as a comic actor blessed with impish charm, and as a pianist of considerable talent.\nToday, that Pathétique performance has come to haunt the Dagenham-born star - as he revealed to American interviewer Barbara Walters on her 20-20 programme on ABC TV last week. 'I so loved playing and now I can listen but ...' Then he stopped, his hands open in front of him, staring at them in grief.\nIt was a deeply unsettling interview in which Moore disclosed for the first time, in a slurred and hesitant voice, that he fully understands his fate. 'I think I am going to die,' he mumbled, propping himself up with a walking stick, pausing and seeming frequently to lose the thread of his thoughts. 'Um... I don't know... I don't think it's going to be, umm... pleasant,' he told Walters.\nMoore is suffering from Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, a rare neurological disorder related to Parkinson's Disease, which took doctors four years to diagnose. Early symptoms include slurred speech, confusion, falling over and difficulty in swallowing, which can cause victims to drown in their own saliva. 'Choking to death must be awful,' said Moore, now aged 64. 'I don't find anything comforting, although my mood is fine now, but...', and he again faltered into silence.\nMoore's appearance on Walters' show is his first in public since his diagnosis. Wearing a baggy blue woolly cardigan, he said: 'I don't feel cheated or bitter. It was good that I had my career before this happened and I did 10 [his 1979 film hit with Bo Derek] and Arthur, and I hope people remember and love me in those roles.'\nIn Britain, Moore, the son of a typist and a railway electrician who won a music scholarship to Oxford, is best remembered as Peter Cook's cuddly sidekick on their TV series Not Only... But Also . In the USA, however, he is famed for his romantic comedy leads in films such as the 1981 Hollywood comedy Arthur in which he played a loveable millionaire lush, a role that earned him an Oscar nomination, and provided him with another performance that has come back to haunt him. The staggering, slurred antics of Arthur began to be replayed by Moore himself. The tabloids labelled him an alcoholic, and despite the assurances of his friends that they had never seen him drink to excess, they reported his falls, outbursts, domestic upsets and car crashes.\nMoore said: 'It's amazing that Arthur has invaded my body to the point that I have [seemed] to become him. That's the way people looked at me. But I want people to know I am not intoxicated and... that I am going through this disease as well as I can. But I'm trapped in this body and there's nothing I can do about it.'\nOn the set of his last attempt at a film, The Mirror Has Two Faces directed by Barbara Streisand in 1996, he was sacked for forgetting his lines. But long-time friend Blake Edwards, the Hollywood director and husband of British singer-actress Julie Andrews, said Moore was always a professional. When he was fired, Moore knew his acting career was over; the trouble was he still did not know why his mental powers were failing.\nDivorced three times, from British actress Suzy Kendall, American actress Tuesday Weld and model Brogan Lane, in 1994, he wed Californian Nicole Rothschild. The couple had a son, now four, but there was violence between them and Moore was once arrested. He has now left California and lives in New Jersey with the former New York Times music critic and pianist Rena Fruchter and her composer husband and is currently undergoing therapy at the same institute that treated the paralysed Superman star, Christopher Reeve.\nFruchter, who reviewed a Moore concert many years ago as a doubter and left marvelling at his musicianship, joined Moore on the interview to prompt him when he groped for words, and was seen supporting him as they walked near her home. Moore called her 'a saint' and added: 'She has an endless compassion for me, and... I just feel... er feel, she is extraordinary in that way... I can't think of anyone else taking care of me.'\nIndeed, it was Fruchter who first realised that Moore's problems were caused by something far more sinister than occasional lapses of concentration, or alleged bouts of drinking. On a 1996 Australian tour, when both played the piano, she realised his deterioration as a pianist was organic and fundamental and certainly not related to over-indulgence. Not long afterwards, doctors succeeded in diagnosing his condition. Moore's past had finally caught up with him.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n'20/20': Dudley Moore ... Star . 0 Shares; Email .

'20/20': Dudley Moore Battles Brain Disease - ABC News '20/20': Dudley Moore Battles Brain Disease - ABC News\nABC News\n'20/20': Dudley Moore Battles Brain Disease\nBy ABC News\nEmail\nABCNEWS' Barbara Walters interviewed actor and musician Dudley Moore for 20/20 in the fall of 1999 about his career and the malady that ultimately took his life. The following is a transcript of their conversation.\nBARBARA WALTERS, ABCNEWS: Now the great comic actor, Dudley Moore. For years, he made us laugh in movies like Arthur and 10. But all that is history.\nLast fall, Dudley Moore took a courageous step, coming on 20/20 to talk about the mysterious illness that has been taking control of his body and his mind. He said that he hoped to reach other people who are afflicted with this rare disease but hadn't received a correct diagnosis.\nWell, he got his wish. After seeing his story here, thousands of people came forward to say that it had helped them or a loved one finally identify their illness. So tonight, with that in mind, we tell Dudley Moore's story again. The man who once made millions of people laugh now touches a very different emotion.\n(VO) He was once a brilliant comic actor and an acclaimed concert pianist. Today, his hands and fingers strain to hit the right notes and keys. Every day, Dudley Moore struggles to get out of bed, to walk, to see and, tragically, to even speak.\nSlowly, over the last decade, a rare and incurable brain disease has insidiously taken over his body. Four times divorced, he is cared for by an old friend, pianist Rena Fruchter, and her family. He now lives far from Hollywood, in this modest New Jersey home, close to his doctors and therapy center. Most people remember Dudley Moore because he made us laugh.\nACTOR DUDLEY MOORE: (From Arthur) Hello, girls!\nWALTERS: (VO) Especially as the lovable millionaire drunk in the 1981 film Arthur.\n(Clip shown from Arthur)\nWALTERS: (VO) For years, rumors swirled that Dudley Moore had become, like Arthur, a drunk. No one knew that it wasn't booze, but his neurological system that made him stagger and slur his speech. Until now, he has never talked about his illness nor its effect on his life filled with triumph and torment.\n(OC) People thought you were Arthur?\nMOORE: Yes.\nWALTERS: They took the character from the movie who was drunk and said, \"That's Dudley.\"\nMOORE: It's amazing that Arthur has invaded my body to the point that I have become him. But that's the way people look at it.\nWALTERS: Your mind is intact.\nMOORE: Yes.\nWALTERS: So you know very well what is happening to you?\nMOORE: Yes, I know very well what is happening to me. I know particularly what people say and think.\nWALTERS: What do you most want people to know?\nMOORE: I want them to know that I'm not intoxicated.\nWALTERS: You're not drunk.\nMOORE: No. And I just want them to know that I am going through this disease as well as I can.\nWALTERS: Do you feel as if you are a prisoner in your own body?\nMOORE: Yes, I do. I am trapped in this body, and there is nothing I can do about it.\nWALTERS: (VO) Dudley Moore, in a way, has always been trapped in his body, always faced physical and emotional adversity.\nHe was born 64 years ago in England with a clubfoot. At the time, his mother knew the intense pain he would suffer as he revealed to me in this 1982 interview.\nMOORE: (From 1982 interview) She rather charmingly volunteered the information that she wanted to kill me when I was born … But I mean, I took it in the spirit in which it was offered.\nWALTERS: (From 1982 interview) Because she thought you would be so unhappy?\nMOORE: (From 1982 interview) Because she knew or thought that I was going to be so unhappy. Of course, this influenced the way I felt about myself, you know, so that I grew up with a great lack of self-confidence. And I spent a lot of time in the hospital, and I wasn't able to cope with it very well — until I discovered comedy.\nWALTERS: (VO) He escaped through comedy and music, attending Oxford on an organ scholarship. There he formed the comedy group, Beyond the Fringe, and went on to enormous success with Peter Cook in both England and here in America on Broadway.\nMOORE: (From an old comedy show) (Singing) \"Until we meet again.\"\nWALTERS: (VO) In the early '80s, at age 44, he became an unlikely international movie star and sex symbol when he was cast opposite Bo Derek in the film 10 by director Blake Edwards.\nBLAKE EDWARDS, DIRECTOR: Oh, he's a consummate actor. His instincts are wonderful. He lives in a state of constant humor.\nWALTERS: (VO) The film also showed the full range of his talent. Bo Derek remembers the first time Moore played the movie's theme song.\nBO DEREK, ACTRESS: All of a sudden, Dudley started to play the song. And it was like a new piece of music. It was as though he transformed. And I remember everybody just sat wherever they were standing. They just sat down and watched him play.\nWALTERS: (VO) Then came his 1981 Oscar-nominated success in Arthur.\n(Clip from Arthur showing Dudley Moore appearing drunk)\nBLAKE EDWARDS: He's a good actor. There are some people that just know how to play drunks. I make a study of drunks. And his drunk was as good as any I've ever seen.\n(Clip from Arthur showing Moore appearing drunk)\nWALTERS: (VO) Dudley Moore was on top of the world. He was hot, in demand, and on Hollywood's A-list. But after Arthur, with a series of bad film choices, his career spiraled downward.\nSo Moore returned to his first love, music. He began playing in jazz bands, recording classical albums, and performing with world-renowned orchestras, here with famous conductor Sir George Solti.\nRENA FRUCHTER: I was absolutely blown away the first time I heard him play. I had no idea he was such a wonderful musician.\nWALTERS: (VO) Seventeen years ago, as a music columnist for The New York Times, Rena Fruchter met and wrote about Moore and his music. They have been close friends and collaborators ever since.\nRENA FRUCHTER: Dudley is a musician, I think, first. I think in his soul, he would probably have to agree with this. And everything else, I feel, grew around that.\nWALTERS: What does music mean to you?\nMOORE: Music means everything to me. It is an art that I love to practice.\nWALTERS: (VO) But he never gave up on acting. In the early '90s, he starred in two television series, one called Daddy's Girl.\n(Clip from Daddy's Girl)\nWALTERS: (VO) Both series failed and those close to Moore remember that something seemed wrong, especially to his manager of 25 years, Lou Pitt.\n(OC) Dudley was forgetting his lines?\nLOU PITT: It wasn't that he was forgetting them. He was having difficulty grasping them.\nWALTERS: What did you think?\nLOU PITT: You know, at first, I thought that it was personal, that it was trouble, that he was preoccupied. This is a consummate professional. He would be there, you know, before anybody else. He would know all his lines.\nWALTERS: And now, suddenly, he can't remember his lines.\nLOU PITT: Couldn't remember a thing.\nWALTERS: Then in 1995, you had a really good role in the Barbra Streisand movie, The Mirror Has Two Faces.\nMOORE: Mm-hmm.\nMOORE: They fired me because I couldn't remember my lines after a certain point.\nWALTERS: This must have been devastating for you.\nMOORE: It was devastating.\nWALTERS: (VO) It was probably Dudley Moore's last chance at a comeback. After the disaster on the Streisand set, it was unlikely that he would ever be hired as an actor again.\nRENA FRUCHTER: He felt like his life was over at that point. He said, \"Something is wrong. I don't know what is going on.\" That was a major blow for him.\nWALTERS: To be fired?\nRENA FRUCHTER: Yeah, yeah.\nWALTERS: And to know that the career in acting was probably going to be over?\nRENA FRUCHTER: Yeah, well, he said that. He said, \"That's the end of my acting career.\"p>\nWALTERS: (VO) In the midst of a deep depression, rumors started to swirl in Hollywood and in the tabloids that his career was over, that Moore was an alcoholic. In public, he was often seen wobbling and slurring words.\nBut his closest friends say they never saw him drink excessively.\nBLAKE EDWARDS: I was shocked, because that wasn't the Dudley I knew. I never thought it's some serious illness, some impairment. I thought, \"Well, it's because he's having all those personal problems, maybe he's taken up booze, and maybe he's gotten involved in drugs.\"\nWALTERS: (VO) His personal life was also in shambles. Despite his height and clubfoot, he had always been a ladies' man, attracting tall, beautiful women. Some called him \"Cuddly Dudley.\" But his relationships and marriages were often marked by turbulence, especially his last wife, who made headlines after accusing him of a string of abuses, from drugs to assault.\nMoore denies it all, even the time she had him arrested for allegedly striking her. Though charges were later dropped, it was clear that other unexplainable problems persisted. In 1995 and '96, he was involved in a series of car accidents. In one, he drove off a Colorado road and down a steep slope. His vision and concentration were off, but he refused to see a doctor, insisting it was only age.\n(OC) What were your first symptoms where you said, \"Something is wrong\"?\nMOORE: Well, I think in Australia.\nWALTERS: (VO) It was in Australia in 1996, while performing with his pianist friend Rena Fruchter, that he began having problems. His acting career in ruins, Moore thought he still had his music. But he began to have trouble playing. His once-fluid sound was now erratic and stumbling.\nRENA FRUCHTER: I didn't know what to think. There was a lot going on. He started having trouble with one finger and things just weren't going exactly the way he wanted them to. We just had no idea.\nWALTERS: What did the reviewers say?\nRENA FRUCHTER: The reviewers said everything from, \"It Was a Perfect 10\" to \"Moore is Less.\" There were reviews that didn't even show Dudley. There was one that said, \"Dudley Drunk on Stage\" question mark.\nWALTERS: What did you think was wrong with you?\nMOORE: I thought it was some illness that I couldn't fathom.\nWALTERS: Were you scared?\nMOORE: Yes.\nWALTERS: (VO) So scared that Fruchter finally convinced him to seek medical help. Doctors in London and New York offered an array of theories, but each turned out to be a dead end. At the Mayo Clinic, doctors discovered a hole in his heart, but surgery didn't fix his increasing struggle to speak and walk. A team of neurologists and a battery of tests followed, but no one could figure out what was wrong. His illness remained a mystery, and his depression became intense.\n(OC) Did you ever think of committing suicide?\nMOORE: Yes. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know when it was.\nWALTERS: But you remember thinking…\nMOORE: Yes.\nWALTERS: …You just wanted to give up and die?\nMOORE: Yes.\nWALTERS: But that wasn't going to happen, not as long as he had a friend like Rena and a doctor who would finally tell Dudley Moore what was wrong with him.\nIn 1994, Dudley Moore, the brilliant comedian and pianist, began to realize that he was losing control of his body. He had trouble talking, playing the piano, even walking. But the big question was why? It would take four years, one devoted friend, and the right medical specialist for Dudley Moore to discover, finally, what he was fighting and what it would take for him to survive.\n(VO) In 1998, as his body continued to inexplicably break down, Dudley Moore was desperate. Finally, his friend Rena Fruchter, took him to see Dr. Martin Gizzi, a New Jersey neurologist.\nDR MARTIN GIZZI: On Dudley's first visit, he was rather depressed about not being able to obtain a diagnosis. His major concern was being able to play the piano, though. And he wanted anything that would help him with that.\nRENA FRUCHTER: He took one look … he checked the eye movements, and one of the symptoms is slow, vertical eye movements. And he said, \"I think it's PSP.\"\nWALTERS: (VO) Moore finally had his diagnosis; but the news wasn't good. PSP, or progressive supranuclear palsy, is an extremely rare and hard to detect neurological disorder. The cause is unknown, but an estimated 20,000 Americans suffer from this incurable and debilitating brain disease. It is sometimes compared to Parkinson's, but without the characteristic tremors.\nMARTIN GIZZI: The classic symptoms of PSP include balance difficulty, rigidity of the limbs, slowness of movement, and loss of coordination of eye movements. Depression becomes quite common in later years. Additional symptoms include memory difficulties, slurring of speech, and difficulty swallowing.\nWALTERS: (VO) For now, there are no drugs to cure the disease or stop its relentlessly progressive course. PSP is not fatal, but complications, like pneumonia or choking, could suddenly end Moore's life.\nRENA FRUCHTER: From what I understand, there is a coughing, choking, and swallowing problem with this disease. And people ultimately can die from pneumonia from having this.\nWALTERS: How do you feel when you hear this?\nMOORE: I don't like it. I don't like it. The thought of choking to death must be awful. I don't find it very comforting.\nWALTERS: (VO) Moore said he went public with his disease in order to reach out to other victims of PSP. He gave us extraordinary access to his new life, which includes weekly rehabilitation at the world-famous Kessler Institute.\nDR. THOMAS GALSKI: Our goal is to maintain the quality of life as long as we can, as well as we can.\nWALTERS: (VO) Dr. Thomas Galski is in charge of Moore's treatment, including their weekly psychotherapy.\nTHOMAS GALSKI: Tell me what the mood's like.\nMOORE: The mood is fine.\nTHOMAS GALSKI: His body has, in a sense, betrayed him. The difficulty of having a humorous, quick, witty conversation with someone and being at a loss because you can't process that information as quickly as you've done in the past. It's extremely exasperating in those very little ways.\nMOORE: Yes, it is different than I used to speak.\nTHOMAS GALSKI: Gone? Is the thought gone?\nMOORE: Gone, gone.\nTHOMAS GALSKI: OK.\nWALTERS: (VO) Moore also meets with a speech therapist who helps him with his breathing, to relax, to speak simple words.\nMOORE: Seven, eight, nine, 10.\nOFFSCREEN VOICE: Excellent!\nWALTERS: (VO) And simple phrases.\nMOORE: We are the hero of our own story.\nOFFSCREEN VOICE: Beautiful.\nWALTERS: (VO) By the time he's finished, Moore is physically drained and mentally exhausted. But now, in the early stages of the disease, Moore's doctors want him to stay active. Even though he can no longer play, he lends his support to music for All Seasons, a group that brings music to confined people in nursing homes, prisons and, on this day, a hospital.\nNURSE: Mr. Moore, I'm not Bo Derek, but I love you just as well.\nMOORE: That's nice.\nWALTERS: (VO) But going out in public can be treacherous. The disease affects coordination and balance, and Moore often falls, sometimes two or three times a day.\n(OC) But you never know when it's going to happen?\nMOORE: No.\nRENA FRUCHTER: Just for Dudley to keep going, it's a struggle. He's courageous.\nWALTERS: (VO) In some ways, this is Rena Fruchter's story, too. At great personal sacrifice, she has devoted herself to Moore and is always by his side.\n(OC) Dudley is so much a part of your life. You have to take care of him. You are with him around the clock. You are married. You have children. You have grandchildren.\nRENA FRUCHTER: Mm-hmm.\nWALTERS: Are you a saint?\nRENA FRUCHTER: Hardly.\nWALTERS: Is she a saint, Dudley?\nMOORE: Yes.\nMOORE: She is a saint.\nWALTERS: Certified saint?\nMOORE: She is a saint. Certifiable.\nRENA FRUCHTER: Certifiable.\nMOORE: Yes. She has endless compassion for me. And I just feel that she is extraordinary in that way.\nWALTERS: Dudley, if it were not for Rena, is there anyone else to take care of you?\nMOORE: I don't think so. I mean, I can't imagine somebody taking over that role.\nWALTERS: There is no one else in your life?\nMOORE: No, no.\nWALTERS: You have two sons.\nMOORE: Yes.\nWALTERS: (VO) Patrick is 23. And then there is a little boy of 4.\n(OC) But you don't see your children?\nMOORE: No.\nMOORE: Because I don't want to deteriorate before them.\nWALTERS: You don't want them to see you like this?\nMOORE: No.\nWALTERS: Don't you think they might want to see you?\nMOORE: I suppose so.\nWALTERS: Most of your life, you have had to overcome severe problems. Now this. Are you bitter? Do you feel cheated?\nMOORE: I feel … No, I don't feel cheated. I feel as though it was good that I did my shows before this happened. I got Arthur out and 10 out.\nWALTERS: (VO) And people will always love you in those roles …\nMOORE: Yes.\nWALTERS: … and remember you in those roles.\nMOORE: Yes, hope so.\nBO DEREK: That's so sad that it could have affected his work, and that it was coming on and nobody knew. I think that's tragic.\nBLAKE EDWARDS: It just hurt me deeply that kind of person would have his mind attacked. His greatest challenge will be bravely facing it and whatever that means, coming to some kind of terms with it.\nWALTERS: (VO) What is your prognosis?\nMOORE: I think that I'm going to die. I don't know. I don't think that it's going to be pleasant.\nWALTERS: (VO) What do you miss most?\nMOORE: What I miss most? I miss playing the piano. I love it. And I miss it very much.\nWALTERS: It's been nearly eight months since our story first aired, and Dudley Moore's condition remains relatively unchanged.\nAnd even though he can no longer play the piano, he is currently producing a new CD of his previously recorded concerts, and it will be released in September. The money from the sales will go toward PSP research.\n0 Shares\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nDudley Moore Dead at 66. By ABC ... mistook him for his Arthur character when his illness first caused ... after a certain point,\" Moore told Walters in a 1999 interview. Dudley Moore Dead at 66 - ABC News Dudley Moore Dead at 66 - ABC News\nABC News\nDudley Moore Dead at 66\nBy ABC News\nEmail\nDudley Moore, the comic star of Arthur and 10, died in his New Jersey home Wednesday morning after a long struggle with a degenerative disease. He was 66.\nMoore had been battling progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare and incurable brain disorder similar to Parkinson's disease. In the last years of his life, he was in great pain, gradually losing control of his body until even simple movements, like swallowing, became difficult.\nStill, in his debilitated state, he used his celebrity to shed light on PSP and the estimated 20,000 Americans who struggle with the illness.\n\"I know very well what is happening to me,\" he told ABCNEWS' Barbara Walters in one of his final interviews, in June 2000. \"I just want them to know that I am going through this disease as well as I can.\"\nAn Unlikely Star\nMoore is best remembered as the drunken playboy in Arthur who offers to give up his fortune to marry a waitress (Liza Minnelli) against his family's wishes. The role showed Moore's potential as a comic with pathos.\nSadly, Moore said that many friends and fans mistook him for his Arthur character when his illness first caused his speech to slur. \"It's amazing that Arthur has invaded my body to the point that I have become him,\" he said. \"But that's the way people look at it.\"\nEven from the start, Moore's career seemed like a long shot. He was born in East London with a clubfoot that stunted his growth. As an adult, he stood 5 feet 2 ½ inches.\nHe went on to study music at Oxford, where he met his future partner Peter Cook, along with other performers with whom he formed Beyond the Fringe, a comedy troupe best described as a precursor to Monty Python's Flying Circus.\nOne of Moore's celebrated contributions to the show was his impersonation of the pianist Dame Myra Hess, playing a bombastic version of \"Colonel Bogey's March\" that he couldn't seem to end.\n'I Would Love to Do Serious Roles'\nThe Moore-Cook team appeared on TV and records before making their screen debut in 1966 in The Wrong Box.\nMoore wrote, starred and composed the score for his next film, 30 Is a Dangerous Age, in 1968.\nIn the mid-1970s, he met director Blake Edwards in a therapy group and soon landed the part in Edwards' 1979 film 10, which marked the debut of a dreadlocked Bo Derek.\nThe movie made Moore a major star, and he followed it up with the hit Arthur in 1981. He appeared in a string of comedies, including Unfaithfully Now, Micki + Maude and Arthur 2: On the Rocks. \"I would love to do serious roles,\" he said. \"But I'm not built that way.\"\nDespite his dimunitive stature, \"Cuddly Dudley\" was known as something of a ladies' man. Moore married Suzy Kendall in 1958, Tuesday Weld in 1975, Brogan Lane in 1988 and Nicole Rothschild in 1994. He had a son, Patrick, by his second marriage and a son, Nicholas, by his fourth.\nHe starred in two short-lived sitcoms in the early 1990s — Dudley and Daddy's Girls — but his workload steadily decreased as he began having trouble with basic tasks. Losing the ability to remember his lines, he lost work and rumors spread that he had a drinking problem. In 1995, Barbra Streisand fired him from the movie The Mirror Has Two Faces.\n\"They fired me because I couldn't remember my lines after a certain point,\" Moore told Walters in a 1999 interview. \"It was devastating.\"\nIt wasn't until 1998 that he was finally diagnosed with PSP.\nLosing the ability to take care of himself, he moved into a friend's home in New Jersey, close to his doctors and a rehabilitation center, the Kessler Institute.\nWhen asked what he missed most as PSP ravaged his body, Moore told Walters, \"I miss playing the piano. I love it. And I miss it very much.\"\nABCNEWS Radio and Buck Wolf contributed to this report.\n0 Shares\n\n"
