Bolsover District Council - Voting and Elections Bolsover District Council - Voting and Elections\nVoting and Elections\nYou are here: Your Council\nVoting and Elections\nVoting and Elections\nThere are several types of elections that have an impact upon local government. These are Local government elections (parish, district, county); Parliamentary (General) elections and European Parliament elections\nTo vote in any type of election you must be registered to vote. We understand that there have been messages put on social media saying that people need to re-register to vote. This is not the case. If you have already registered to vote for the elections, then you do not need to re-register. If you are unsure please telephone 01246 242422. \n2015&nbspParliamentary,&nbspDistrict&nbspand&nbspParish&nbspElections\nOn Thursday 7th May 2015, elections were held to elect the Member of Parliament for the Bolsover Constituency and also for your local District and Parish Councillors. \nThe results for the various elections have been declared and posted here.\nNotice of Poll - District and Parish Elections  (410kb)\n FAQ's\nQuestion- In terms of personal expenses of the candidates, do these include the candidates mileage for campaigning mileage?  If so at what rate?  Should the HMRC rate of 45p be used?  This is in relation to both Parliamentary and Local candidates.\nAnswer -  The costs of petrol will be a personal expense if used for the candidate’s travel. We don’t offer a figure – candidates should make an honest assessment of what’s fair according to how much travelling they do and what they pay.\nQuestion - In relation to uncontested Local elections, should the candidates submit a nil return?\nAnswer - All candidates need to provide a return even if it’s a nil one.\n \nTo make sure you are eligible to vote you must be registered on the electoral roll.  To check if you are registered, please contact the Elections Team on 01246 242424.  You are not automatically registered to vote because you pay Council Tax, you must have made a separate application to be included on the register. \n \nAnnual&nbspCanvass&nbsp2016\nThe annual canvass for the register of electors commenced on 19 July with household enquiry forms being posted to every property in the District.\nOur canvassers will now be visiting non-responding households to collect this information from this weekend (26 August). All canvassers appointed by us have been issued with a formal identity card and have been instructed to show this to anyone they visit, the public should also be advised to check this before supplying any information or letting anyone into their homes.\nWe would be very grateful if you would please complete these forms.\nEach year from about mid July every household in Bolsover District will receive a Household Enquiry form, which is also known as the annual canvass.  The information we gather from this enables us to produce the new electoral register and ensures that everyone who should be entitled to vote can do so.\nIf you are not included on the electoral roll you will not be able to vote so it is important that you provide us with up to date information on the occupants of your address.  You can't vote until you reach the age of 18 but any 16 or 17 year olds in your household should be included on the form.  You should not include any children under the age of 16.\nAll of the major credit checking agencies use the electoral roll to verify your details when you apply for a mortgage, loan or other credit agreement.  If you are not on the electoral roll you are likely to have problems in obtaining any form of credit.\nWhen you receive your Household Enquiry Form, please check this carefully to ensure it is correct and advise us of any changes that need to be made.   The form will include details of the various ways of how you can do this.  Please respond without delay as this will mean we need to send out fewer reminders which will help us to keep costs down.\nEU&nbspReferendum\nBolsover District EU Referendum result\nThe Referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union took place on 23rd June 2016. The results are as follows:\nTotal number of ballot papers counted = 41,999\nThe number of votes cast in favour of REMAIN = 12,242\nThe number of votes cast in favour of LEAVE = 29,730\nThe total number of ballot papers rejected = 27\nIndividual&nbspElectoral&nbspRegistration (IER)\nIndividual Electoral Registration (IER)\nThe electoral registration system in Great Britain changed from 10 June 2014. The new system is called Individual Electoral Registration (or IER).\n1. What is individual electoral registration?\nPreviously, the head of the household was responsible for registering everyone who lived at the address. Since 10 June 2014, every individual is responsible for their own voter registration.\n2.  What is different about the new system?\nAs well as individuals taking responsibility for their own registration, the other difference is that people need to provide a few more details about themselves to register. These are date of birth and national insurance number.  You can find your national insurance number on your national insurance number card, payslips or letters regarding benefits, tax credits or pensions.  If you don't know your national insurance number, you can contact Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and they will send you your national insurance number through the post.  You can contact them via www.gov.uk/lost-national-insurance-number or on their telephone helpline 0300 200 3502.\n3. Why has the system changed?\nIndividual Electoral Registration gives you the right and responsibility to register yourself, instead of giving the responsibility to the head of the household. It encourages people to take individual responsibility for their own vote. The change also allows more convenient methods of registration, for example, online registration. Because the new system asks you for your national insurance number and date of birth before you are added to the register, the electoral register is more secure and more resistant to threats of electoral fraud.\n4. How can I find out more about IER?\nYou can also find out more information at www.aboutmyvote.co.uk , www.electoralcommission.org.uk and   www.gov.uk/electoral-register/overview .\n5. How do I register?\nYou can register on line at www.gov.uk/registertovote  or contact us for a registration form on 01246242424.\n6. What is the Electoral Register?\nThe electoral register includes the name and address of every person in the district who is registered to vote.  There are two versions of the register:\nThe full register - lists everyone who is registered to vote.  This version of the register is used for electoral purposes, crime prevention and detection (including fraud), credit checking and jury service selection.  It is unlawful for the full register to be used for any other purpose than those outlined in law and can be inspected at the Council's Offices under supervision of staff.\nThe open register  - can be bought by any person or organisation for purposes such as direct marketing.  Your details will be included on this version of the register unless you tell us that you wish to opt out.  You can do this by contacting us on 01246 242424 or by ticking the appropriate box on your paper or online application form.  This is also an individual responsibility so you cannot do this on someone else's behalf.\nLocal&nbspby&nbspelections\nResults and notices in respect of local by elections in Bolsover District are highlighted below: \nClowne Parish Council (South Ward) - 16th February 2017\nA vacancy for a Parish Councillor has arisen at Clowne Parish Council (South Ward).  Forms of Nomination are available from the Returning Officer, The Arc, High Street, Clowne.  Should there be a contest, the election will be held on Thursday 16th February 2017.  Further details are available on the Notice of Election  (13kb)\nAult Hucknall Parish Council - 3rd November 2016\nDue to the resignation of a Councillor, a vacancy arose in the office of councillor for the Parish Council.

Alternatively, you can register at the address of the hospital if the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) considers that you have been, or will be, in the hospital for a long enough period of time for it to be regarded as the your place of residence.\nIf you do not wish to use your home address or the hospital's address, you can make a declaration of local connection - see above. The declaration must give both the name of the psychiatric hospital and the address where you would be living if you were not in the hospital. If you cannot provide your most recent home address, you should provide an address in the United Kingdom where you have lived at any time.\nIf you are detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 (in Scotland, the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 and, in Northern Ireland, the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986) you may not vote in person, but must instead vote by post (see under heading How to vote ) or proxy (see under heading How to vote ).\nPeople remanded in custody\nThe only prisoners who are entitled to vote are those detained on remand (whether in prison or in hospital) and those convicted but not yet sentenced (see under heading Can you register to vote ).\nYou can register at your address outside the prison. Alternatively, you can register at the address of the prison if the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) considers that you have been, or will be, on remand in the prison for a long enough period of time for it to be regarded as your place of residence.\nIf you do not wish to use your home address or the prison's address, you can make a declaration of local connection - see above. The declaration must give both the name of the prison and the address where you would be living if you were not in the prison. If you cannot provide your most recent home address, you should provide an address in the United Kingdom where you have lived at any time.\nPeople resident in more than one constituency\nYour position if you have more than one home is complex. Your rights to be included on the register and vote in a particular constituency depend on your circumstances. It will be necessary to consult the electoral registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) in this situation.\nYou can be entered on more than one electoral register if you are resident in more than one constituency. For example, if you are a student you may be registered at one address by your parent/guardian and may also register yourself at your college/university town if you are living away from home.\nHowever, in some situations, you may be prevented by the electoral registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) from registering in two places. For example, if you have a holiday home but spend only a few days there each year, you may not be considered to be 'resident' there. However, if you spend most weekends there, the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) may well consider you are eligible to be included in the register. If you wish to appeal against a decision to exclude you from the register, you should follow the correct procedure (see under heading How is the electoral role register compiled ).\nAlthough it is not illegal to be registered in more than one place, it is illegal to vote twice in the same election, for example, a parliamentary general election. However, you can vote in elections for two separate local councils.\nIf you are not in the constituency where you wish to vote on polling day and wish to apply for a proxy vote, you must satisfy the registration officer that you are eligible (see under heading How to vote ). If a proxy vote is refused, there is a right of appeal in the county court (sheriff court in Scotland). You can vote by post without having to meet any specific criteria (see under heading How to vote ).\nHow is the electoral register compiled\nThe electoral register is compiled annually but amended throughout the year. Every local authority has an electoral registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) who is in charge of the process.\nIndividual Electoral Registration\nThe way that you register to vote is changing with the introduction of Individual Electoral Registration (IER). In England and Wales, from 10 June 2014 and in Scotland from 19 September 2014, if you are eligible to vote, you now have to register the details yourself if:\nyou are a new voter, or\nthe details held about you on the current electoral register don’t match with details held on the Department for Work and Pensions database.\nThis is a change from the former system where one person registered everyone eligible to vote in the household on a registration card which was sent back to the local Electoral Registration Office.\nTo prepare for the move to IER, electoral registration officers (EROs) will have written to voters who are already on the current electoral register by 10 August 2014 in England and Wales and by 31 December 2014 in Scotland, to tell them about the changes. They will check the birthdate and National Insurance numbers of people who are already on the current electoral register against the information on the DWP database.\nIf your details match, you will be transferred automatically to IER and there will be no need to do anything.\nWhere there isn’t a match or only some of the details match, the ERO is also able to look at other databases, such as council tax records to confirm your identity. If they are unable to confirm the match through other databases, you will have to register to vote yourself.\nNobody will be taken off the current electoral register until after the next General Election on May 7 2015.\nIt's against the law to give false information on the electoral registration form, or on any other document about voting.\nIf the registration officer asks you for more information, you must give it. If you fail to do so, this is also against the law.\nYou can get more information about registering to vote from the Electoral Commission's website at www.aboutmyvote.co.uk .\nFrom the information you provide, the electoral registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) compiles a register. This is open for inspection all year round at local council offices and other public places, for example, main post offices and libraries. You can apply to be added to the register or to have your details amended on the register at any time throughout the year, although, when an election is held, registration applications must be received between two to four weeks before polling day, depending on the election timetable.\nThe registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) will either publish notices setting out changes to the register or publish a revised version of the register at any point in the year. Your registration should take no longer than six to eight weeks, except during the period when new registration details are being collected, usually between October and March, when an unregistered person might have to wait up to fifteen weeks before being added to the register.\nCan you register anonymously\nYou can register anonymously, but only if you feel at risk, for example, from an ex-partner. Otherwise, failure to provide information to the registration staff or to complete the registration form or to give false information may result in you being prosecuted and fined.\nYou have not been included in the register\nIf you consider you are eligible to register, but have not been included in the register, you can now register online to vote at GOV.UK\nYou can also register by post by downloading the Individual Registration Form\n, completing the form and sending it back to the Electoral Registration Officer at your local council.\nYou can also get a form from the electoral registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) at your local council. Alternatively, you can apply in a letter containing all relevant information. You can make the application or you can ask someone else to do it on your behalf.\nAll additions to, and deletions from, the register are issued by the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) in a public notice. You can object to any amendment to the register - see below.\nIf the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) decides to allow your application, your name will be entered on the electoral register with effect from the day the notice is published. However, if your name is added to the register after the close of nomination of candidates, you will not be able to vote in that particular election. You should therefore make sure you register to vote at least 12 working days before the date of the election in which you want to vote.\nIf the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) decides not to allow an application, you will be notified of the decision and the grounds on which it was made. You then have three days from the date of receiving this notice in which to ask for a hearing - see below.\nHow to object to an inclusion in the register\nYou may wish to object to the inclusion of your name, or someone else's name, in the register, for example, because you believe they are no longer resident in the constituency or are not entitled to vote. You can also object to the inclusion of your details in copies of the register which are sold to commercial organisations. If you wish to object you should contact the electoral registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) and put your objections in writing. The local authority may have a standard form that you can fill in. Any person on the electoral register (not necessarily in the same constituency) may make such an objection.\nIf the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) decides to disallow your objection immediately, you will be notified of the decision and the grounds on which it was made. You then have three days from the date of the registration officer's notice to ask for a hearing - see below.\nIf there is a hearing, both the objector and the person they are objecting to will be able to present their cases.\nHearings of claims and objections\nUnless a claim or objection is allowed or disallowed immediately, the electoral registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) will set a time and place to hear the claim or objection.\nAt the hearing, you and/or the objector can appear in person or choose to be represented by someone else. You may submit written statements as well as oral evidence.\nIf you are still unhappy with the decision of the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland), you can appeal against it in the county court (sheriff court in Scotland).\nHow to vote\nBefore polling day, everyone entitled to vote will be sent a polling card, unless a proxy (see below) or postal vote (see below) has previously been agreed. The card will give details of the polling station and the hours it is open. You do not need to take the polling card to the polling station when you go to vote, but it may be more convenient to do so.\nIf you do not want to, or cannot, attend the polling station in person, you can apply for a postal vote (see below), or a proxy vote (see below) if you meet the relevant criteria.\nFor more information about how to vote in Scottish parliamentary elections, see The Scottish Parliament .\nHelp for disabled people\nIf you are disabled, you may be able to vote by post (see below) or by proxy (see below).\nIf you are partially sighted and choose to vote in person, the polling station must display a large print version of the ballot paper to assist you. If you are blind or partially sighted the polling station must also provide a device to enable you to fill in your ballot papers without any need for assistance from anyone else.\nIf you are physically disabled or unable to read, you may take a companion to help you complete the ballot form and put it in the ballot box. Your companion must be aged 18 or over (16 or over if it is a Scottish Parliamentary or local government election in Scotland) and be entitled to vote, and must make a written declaration to this effect.\nYour companion cannot help more than one disabled voter to vote at that election. The presiding officer has to be satisfied that you need the help of a companion in order to vote.\nAlternatively, you can ask the presiding officer to mark the ballot paper on your behalf.\nPostal voters and Individual Electoral Registration\nChanges to postal voting will happen before the next general election in 2015.\nIf you currently vote by post, your details will be checked against the DWP database. If they match you will be automatically transferred to IER.\nIf your details don’t match you will no longer be able to vote by post until you have registered yourself. The electoral registratio officer will write to you to tell you how to do this.\nIf you have not registered yourself to vote by post at least 12 working days before 7 May 2015, you will not be able vote by post in the next General Election. However, if you are already registered to vote you will be able to vote in person at a polling station because your details will still be on the current electoral register.\nOnce you are registered to vote, you can choose to vote by post at both parliamentary and local government elections for:\nan indefinite period\nTo make an application for a postal vote, you must:\ngive your full name, date of birth and national insurance number\nprovide the address where you are or will be registered\nprovide the address to which the ballot paper must be sent\nspecify the period or the particular election for which the application is made\nstate whether the application is made for parliamentary elections, local government elections, or both\nsign and date the application.\nComplete the application form available from your electoral registration office or from the voting website ( www.aboutmyvote.co.uk ). Only one application form can be used for each person. Alternatively, you can apply in writing, although care must be taken to ensure that the letter contains all the information necessary (see above).\nIt is against the law to give false information about an application for a postal vote. It is also against the law to get the registration officer to send a postal vote application form to an address when the person entitled to vote has not agreed to this.\nAn application for a postal vote has to be received by the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) at least 12 working days before the date of the poll. If you have already registered to vote by post and then change your mind, for example, you want instead to vote by proxy or to be removed from the record, the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) must receive your application at least eleven working days before the poll. Once a successful application has been made, you should be added to a section of the register known as the absent voters list.\nYou should receive confirmation that you have been given a postal vote (if there is enough time before the election). You will receive:\na ballot paper\na postal voting statement that you must sign and on which you must state your date of birth. By signing the statement, you are confirming that you are the person to whom the ballot paper was sent\npre-paid envelopes as necessary\ninformation about how to obtain guidance on voting in languages other than English, in Braille or in other forms such as audible forms.\nIf you are registered and have applied to vote by post and you do not receive your postal ballot paper by the fourth working day before the day of the poll, you can apply to the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) for a replacement ballot paper. The application for a replacement ballot paper must include evidence of your identity. You should then be issued with a replacement ballot paper.\nProxy votes\nVoting by proxy means that you appoint someone else to vote on your behalf.\nThe person appointed as a proxy must be eligible to vote (see under heading Can you register to vote ).\nOnce you are registered to vote by proxy, you will be able to do so at both parliamentary and local government elections for either an indefinite period, a particular period or for a particular election. Only specified groups (see below), can apply to vote by proxy for a particular or indefinite period, but anyone can apply to vote by proxy for a particular election.\nAnyone can apply to vote by proxy for a particular election (see above). However, only the following people may be eligible to vote by proxy for a particular or indefinite period:-\npeople registered as service voters (members of the armed forces)\npeople registered as overseas electors (see under heading Special arrangements for specific groups when registering to vote ). People in this situation cannot vote in local government elections\npeople who cannot go in person to vote without making a journey by sea or air\npeople who cannot reasonably be expected to vote in person because of the general nature of their occupation or that of their spouse or civil partner (evidence is required from their employer)\npeople who are blind or have some other disability and who, as a result, cannot reasonably be expected to vote in person at the allotted polling station or cannot reasonably be expected to vote unaided - see above.\nIf you wish to apply to vote by proxy for a particular election and you are not in one of the groups listed above, you must satisfy the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) that, on the date of the poll for that election, you cannot reasonably be expected to vote in person at your allotted polling station. This requirement does not apply to people listed above.\nTo make an application for a proxy vote, you must fill in an application form on which you must:-\nstate your full name; and\nprovide the address where you are or will be registered; and\nprovide the full name and address of the proxy together with their family relationship to you, if relevant; and\nstate the grounds on which you claim to be entitled to a proxy vote - see above; and\nspecify the period or the particular election for which the application is made; and\nstate whether the application is made for parliamentary elections, local government elections, or both; and\nsign and date the application - see below.\nIt is against the law to try and persuade someone to vote by proxy or to give false information about an application for a proxy vote. It is also against the law to get the registration officer to send a proxy vote application form to an address when the person entitled to vote has not agreed to this.\nAn application for a proxy vote has to be received by the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) at least six working days before the date of the poll. But if you become ill just before polling day, you can apply for an emergency proxy vote if you have medical evidence.\nIf you have already registered to vote by proxy and then change your mind, for example, you want instead to vote by post or to be removed from the record, the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) must receive notification of this at least eleven working days before the poll. Once a successful application has been made, you should be added to a section of the electoral register known as the absent voters list.\nYou should receive confirmation that you have been given a proxy vote (if there is enough time before the election) confirming the name and address of the proxy and the length of time they may act as your proxy. The proxy will also receive confirmation and, shortly before polling day, will receive a proxy poll card or a proxy postal ballot paper, depending on the chosen method of voting.\nProxy vote and disabled voters\nIf you are applying for a proxy vote (for a particular or indefinite period) on the grounds of disability, the application form must be countersigned by a registered healthcare practitioner or social worker. If you live in residential care, a local authority care or nursing home or sheltered accommodation, you can have your application signed by the person in charge. Some people don't have to have their application countersigned – see below.\nThe person who signs the application form has to state that:-\nthey are treating (or providing care to) you for the physical incapacity specified in the application; and\nyou cannot reasonably be expected to go in person to the allotted polling station or to vote there unaided; and\nthe physical incapacity is likely to continue either indefinitely or for the particular period specified in the application.\nIf you are applying for a proxy vote (for a particular or indefinite period) on the grounds of disability, you will not have to fulfil the requirements listed above if you are:-\nregistered blind; or\ngetting the higher rate of the mobility component of disability living allowance, or the enhanced rate of the mobility component of personal independence payment, or armed forces independence payment; or\nregistered with the local authority on grounds of physical and/or mental disability.\nFor more information about disability living allowance, see Benefits for people who are sick or disabled .\nAppealing against refusal of a postal or a proxy vote\nIf the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) refuses an application for a postal or proxy vote, you will be notified of this decision and the reasons for it. You can appeal against this decision, but not if you applied to vote by post or proxy in a particular election only.\nYou must give notice of the appeal by letter to the registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) within 14 days of having received the notice of refusal. You must specify the grounds of the appeal.\nThe registration officer (chief electoral officer in Northern Ireland) will forward the notice of appeal to the appropriate county court (sheriff court in Scotland) with details of their decision.\nChallenging the outcome of an election\nYou can challenge the outcome of a parliamentary or European parliamentary election on the grounds of an irregularity. In the case of a local government election, four or more voters acting together can challenge the outcome.\nTo challenge the outcome, you need to file an election petition at the Election Petitions Office of the Royal Courts of Justice (Court of Session in Scotland). This must be done within 21 days of the election. A fee of £120 will be charged.\nMore information about the procedure for challenging the outcome can be obtained from the Election Petitions Office. The address is:-\nEngland and Wales\n\n"
