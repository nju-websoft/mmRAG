If the photo of Hedy Lamarr was taken in 1991, as the wording makes it appear, she would have been 77 and looks pretty damn good, even doing her best to disguise herself.

I read that friends had to coax her out at this period, because she was too exhausted to put all the effort into glamming up anymore.

Davis had always been one to relish roles that made her unattractive so it seems logical that even after cancer treatments/surgeries she would make the talk show rounds telling stories and smoking cigs.  Bette Davis, recluse? No way. Wish she were still alive.

Bette didn't really try to hide it; in fact, you could say she flaunted it. Knowing her face was a wreck she'd go on talk shows, hair all styled, face all made up, wearing clothes unsuitable for a woman her age as if to say, this is me, and if you don't like it fuck off. Liz looked bad due to a lifetime of overeating, alcoholism and drug addiction. Her illnesses didn't help, but her illnesses weren't the cause of the decline in her appearance. But she still wanted to be considered beautiful, so she'd go do public appearances heavily made up, hair (I guess it was a wig) raven black, wearing expensive clothes and dripping with jewels. She didn't look beautiful. She looked sad and pathetic, trying to hang on to her long gone youth and beauty.\nClara Bow got very fat in her later years but her skin still looked great. It was one of her best features, her \"soft baby skin\", as Louise Brooks described it.\nI think it was in her early seventies that Marlene Dietrich retreated to her Paris apartment and never went out again. She'd had an accident, had fallen off the stage due to being drunk in an armor-like, skin tight dress, and that was the beginning of the end. She did NOT want to be photographed in her old age, so she holed up in her apartment. A very good documentary about her was \"Marlene\", directed by  Maximilian Schell. She would not allow him to film her (she was 81 at the time); you just hear her voice.  She hated the movie, until it started getting great reviews and winning awards.\nPoor Judy Garland looked ghastly towards the end of her life. Lifelong drug addiction and alcoholism will do that to you.\nGreta Garbo never had any plastic surgery. You'd think with that face she would be desperate to preserve it, but she let nature take its course. She had no vanity. People said that even elderly she still had that incredible bone structure. Garbo smoked and had an occasional drink, but was never a drug addict or alcoholic. She didn't age prematurely, like others did.\nby Anonymous\nreply 76\n05/15/2016\nSupposedly this was one of the last images taken of silent screen vamp NiTA NALDI.

She never left the Upper East Side apartment after that event. She communicated with everyone via the phone and via fan correspondence  - distributing signed copies of those pics.  I believe it was either the producers of the original Superman themselves or Steven Spielberg, as a favor to the producers - asked Joan to play the Mother role in the Chris Reeve Superman, but she turned them down.\nHere is what is believed to be Ginger Rogers' final video footage, less than one year before she died.

I've seen a few photos of her in her later years, but she eventually became so ill and deranged she was confined to a Hollywood old folk's home. One day a woman came in her room wanting a picture and she started to scream. She probably looked ghastly; white-haired, blind, and since she never had a facelift, probably very wrinkled. Mental illness ran in her family; her sister was a schizophrenic. A visitor said that Norma appeared to be \"in the grip of a permanent anxiety attack.\" A minor actress who was in the home said of her: \"she was the biggest of them all, and here she is, blind and dying down the hall.

Would she have had facelifts? Maybe. Even so, she wouldn't have been able to be the premier sex symbol much longer. It's hard to imagine her growing old. She was terrified of aging. I think she would rather have died rather than grow old.\nIf Natalie Wood had gotten to old age chances are she'd look fine. Her entire life she looked good; she was never overweight, always kept her figure. I don't think she would have overdone it with plastic surgery.

None of those projects threw off considerable residuals after Moss Hart's death in 1961. While Kitty was never poor, she wasn't loaded with cash. She herself worked, and inherited  licensing money from Moss Hart's catalogue, but she didn't make much money at all from those titles mentioned. Frankly, she probably earned more from high schools performing \"You Can't Take it With You\",  and \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\".\nI was at her home catering the last year of her life, and it indeed was a super duper 12-room spread in one of my favorite NY buildings, but it needed a ton of work.

Movie star's lives are played out in front of us, including their decline from ultra desirable to past their prime survivor/casualty and our fascination with it is understandable. This thread is interesting as it exposes all of that. Even the snarky stuff about how badly some age is really about our own fear of growing older. It's weird that in this age of hurt feelings and where every issue is shouted from the rooftops ( race, sexuality, trans issues, fat-shaming, slut-shaming etc etc ) aging is still a taboo as evidenced by the dismissive talk of eldergays around here . It's the one life experience that, if lucky, will we all share and yet we have such a dread of growing older that we do anything and everything to deny it. We lie about our ages, use cosmetics and surgery and mock those who don't sufficiently disguise the inevitable wear and tear of life.

Along the south side of the street are the Southgate apts.  They were rentals until the 80s when they became co-ops.  River House and Garbo's building directly across the street were the only co-ops for decades.  I lived in River House, that is to say, my parents did.  Used to see Garbo all the time in the 'hood.  She was very predictable in her habits.  Watched the filming of The Way We Were in the hood in the early 70s- got this close to Streisand and Redford.  52nd is sandwiched  between Beekman Place and the south end of Sutton Place.
