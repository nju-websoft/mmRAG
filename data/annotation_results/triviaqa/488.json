Stella's birth almost ended in disaster where both mother and child almost died - the traumatic event led her father to pray she be born \"on the wings of an angel\", thus inspiring the name of her parent's band \"Wings\". McCartney admits she had a \"normal\" childhood, despite her famous parents - though she did travel the globe with them and their group, the whole family lived in a two-bedroom while she was growing up. Stella was on her own and independent by the time she was in college, making her own money (and sometimes having to clean dishes at a near-by restaurant to do so.) At age 15 she had the opportunity to work with Christian Lacroix on his first couture collection and in 1995, she graduated from London's Central St Martins College of Art & Design, showcasing at her collection of clothes modeled by good celebrity friends Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss . In 1997, with two collections under her belt, McCartney was appointed chief designer at Paris fashion house Chloé, but resigned four years later to enter in a joint venture with the Gucci Group. The line opened three stores and later Stella expanded her brand to include perfume. In 2000, she was presented VH1/Vogue Designer of the Year award by her father. Most recently, McCartney designed a line of clothing and accessories for H&M, helping sales to skyrocket with her designer name and in August of 2003, married publisher Alasdhair Willis.\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: ratisfatter@yahoo,com\nSpouse (1)\n( 30 August  2003            -  present) (4 children)\nTrivia (31)\nDesigned Madonna 's wedding dress.

In the half-century since it was founded, the prestigious French label has stayed true to the concept of romantic, feminine fashion. Today, the houses newest Creative Director, Phoebe Philo, will bring her unique vision to this label at a moment when Chloe is enjoying unprecedented success. After fifty years, Chloe continues to connect with a new generation of stylish women.\nThe house of Chloe was founded in 1952 by two Parisians, Jacques Lenoir and Gaby Aghion. In a rapidly modernising post-war world, old traditions were giving way to new ideas, and their proposition was a radical one: they would make luxury pret--porter, delivering the kind of exceptional fashion off the rack that, until then, had only been available as couture.\nThe romantic, fluid clothes that they created marked a bold departure from the stiff formality of womens fashion in the early fifties. Chic, sensual, and unmistakably French, Chloe immediately established itself as a house that celebrated a softer aesthetic. In 1963, the houses founders appointed Karl Lagerfeld as head designer. Under Lagerfelds direction, the Chloe label produced iconic fashion: the gauzy floral prints and fluid, floating shapes that he created defined the bohemian spirit of the seventies and made Chloe one of the most popular labels of the period.\nThis era also saw the launch of the Chloe fragrance. Chloe, introduced in 1974, was an immediate commercial success, and continues to be one of the worlds best selling fragrances today.\nIn 1985, the Swiss-based luxury group Richemont Group bought the house from Aghion and Lenoir, and setting the company up for expansion on the international market. In the late eighties, Martine Sitbon helmed the house, bringing her uniquely modern vision of womens fashion to the label.\nLagerfeld returned to the house in 1992, and for the next five years he consistently reinvented the Chloe woman, dressing her in delicately torn neo-classical dresses, and bright hippie-inspired lace.\nIn the last five years, the house has undergone a dramatic period of growth. In 1997, the then twenty-six year old Stella McCartney took over as Creative Director. In a period that saw a new generation of customers embracing luxury fashion, McCartneys youthful, spirited sensibility re-energized Chloe and made it highly desirable once again. Infusing Chloes classic soft, romantic spirit with the pulse of the street, McCartney effortlessly mixed delicately feminine pieces with structured tailoring, putting flirtatious camisoles under skinny, tailored suits and pairing revealing blouses with low-riding jeans and stiletto heels. This vision of the new Chloe woman hit a chord with young women around the world, and proved hugely successful.\nMcCartney announced her departure from Chloï¿½ in early 2001, naming 27-year-old Phoebe Philo as her successor. The move left most in the fashion industry baffled, as Philo was a relative unknown. She had attended Central St. Martins a year behind McCartney and worked under her for only four years, but did not have the credentials typical of designers at any other major house. Planted firmly at the intersection of casual street chic and whimsical femininity, Philoï¿½s first collection forged an image that the company calls \"luxurious, romantic and quinessentially French.\" Philo also created several \"it bags\" during her time at Chloï¿½, including the Paddington bag, which became a smash hit in 2004 and spawned many knockoffs. On January 6, 2006, Philo announced that she was stepping down as creative director for the fashion house in order to spend more time with her young daughter.\nHaving played a pivotal role in the reinvention of Chloe, the young British designer will continue to grow the brand, launching new categories of merchandise such as accessories and swimwear, and developing the secondary line, See by Chloe.\nChloï¿½ announced in October 2006 that Paulo Melim Andersson, a Swede who worked for Marni for seven years, would take over as creative director. ï¿½His mission is to find the new direction for the Chloï¿½ brand,ï¿½ Chloï¿½ chairman and chief executive Ralph Toledano told WWD. ï¿½He will be given, like his predecessors, a lot of freedom to find his own way.ï¿½\nAndersson has shown three collections for Chloe each exemplifying an edgier, abstract quirkiness to a line which has long been associated with romantic, girly Parisian notions. Andersson latest fall 2008 collection fulfilled elements of Chloe's charm like tea dresses and ruffled edges, however, the collection was met with mixed reviews.\nPaula Melim Andersson is an example of a designer with a tremendous amount of talent, however, not the right fit for Chloe despite a 9% increase in Chloe sales during his 2006-2007 year.\nHannah MacGibbon who worked under Phoebe Philo for 5 years prior to Andersson has been neamed the new creative director.\nAlas, Chloe is back in a woman's hands.\nThe Look\nStyle, modernity, and a strong sense of femininity have been the key elements of Chloï¿½ since its inception. Maintaining a quiet confidence among the Parisian ready-to-wear houses, Chloï¿½ has relyied on the abilities of various already-established designers to produce fresh and vibrant clothing which reflected and, in the high points of its history under Martine Sitbon, Karl Lagerfeld, and upstart Stella McCartney defined the zeitgeist of Chloï¿½ ï¿½lan.\nWho Wears It\nHalle Barry, Carmen Electra, Kate Bosworth, Mary Kate Olsen, Claudia Schiffer, Kylie Minogue, Megan Fox, Jessica Alba, Rossellini Wiedemann, Alicia Silverstone, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Blake Lively, Maria Sharapova, Maria Sharapova, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, Heidi Montag, Mischa Barton, Kristen Dunst, Paris Hilto, Olivia Chantecaille, Mischa Barton,\nPerfumes\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nFind the most iconic and influential fashion designers to date on the Best of Fashion Designers.

Growing up in Manhattan's trendy Soho neighborhood, Posen was a fashion fiend from a young age and parlayed his passion into a successful career, producing couture gowns along with the more afforable Z Spoke line for Saks Fifth Avenue and a collection for Target.\nBest Fashion Designers\nTom Ford\nAmerican designer Tom Ford graduated from Parsons The New School for Design with a degree in architecture, but soon realized his love for fashion while interning at Chloe's press office. He has gone on to work for Perry Ellis, completely transform the Gucci brand, and become Creative Director for Yves Saint Laurent. In 2005 he announced the creation of the TOM FORD brand and its first flagship store opened two years later on Madison Avenue in NYC.\nBest Fashion Designers\nKarl Lagerfeld\nChloe, Fendi, and Chanel have all notably been touched by the hands and soul of the notorious Karl Lagerfeld. He was born in Germany in the 30s (he remains very secretive about the actual year of his birth), moved to Paris at 14 to work as a draftsman, by 17 was working for Pierre Balmain, and Valentino soon to follow. Vogue has called Lagerfeld the \"unparalleled interpreter of the mood of the moment,\" and today his many ventures include designing everything from shoes to wedding dresses to crystal art collections.\nBest Fashion Designers\nPhoebe Philo\nBorn in Paris and educated in London, fashion designer Phoebe Philo has been adding clean and chic silhouettes to the French luxury brand, Celine for years now. Creating her minimalist mark at the fashion house, Philo's collections for Celine are modern, sophisticated, and most importantly wearable. Designing signature and instantly recognizable color-blocked coats and bags have won Philo an incredibly dedicated fan following. In June 2011, Philo was awarded the title of \"International Designer of the Year\" by the CFDA and her loyal fans have even been dubbed the \"Philophiles\" by the fashion press.\nBest Fashion Designers\nMarc Jacobs\nWith a number of prestigious awards under his belt from the Parsons School of Design, Jacobs moved onto working for Perry Ellis, but was let go from the label after infamously designing a \"grunge\" collection. By 1994 he had produced his first full collection of menswear and in 1997 was made Creative Director of Louis Vuitton, where he remains today as well as Head Designer for his own label.\nBest Fashion Designers\nStella McCartney\nConfidence, sexy femininity and precise tailoring encompassed McCartney's first runway collection and soon became her signature style. After producing only two collections, she was named the Creative Director of Chloe in Paris in 1997. In 2001, she launched her own fashion house with the Gucci Group (now PPR Luxury Group). Growing up in the English countryside and being a lifelong vegetarian, you will never find fur or leather used in her clothing, accessories or lingerie.\nBest Fashion Designers\nCoco Chanel\nGabriell \"Coco\" Chanel was born in 1883 in France and spent her childhood in an orphanage where she was taught to sew by nuns. At 20 she opened her first shop in Paris and sold hats, was soon after making clothing, and by the 1920s launched Chanel No. 5 - the first perfume to feature a designer's name. In 1925, she introduced the now legendary collarless suit jacket and fitted skirt. She remained Chief Designer of her line until her death in 1971.\nBest Fashion Designers\nGiorgio Armani\nFew brands can quite pull off the distinctive yet subdued, sensual  yet European kind of simplicity?except, of course, Giorgio Armani. Born in Piacenza, Italy in 1936 Giorgio Armani had a variety of different careers growing up, from photography to medicine. After working for the fashion house Nino Cerruti, Giorgio decided it was high time he branched out, debuting his first women's wear collection in 1974. Said to be always influenced by menswear, Giorgio brought immaculate tailoring and clean cuts to his ladies ensembles. Elegant and fresh, he is famous for his sophisticated pieces that are not only wearable but altogether timeless. Today, owning an Armani suit and separates is a status symbol for both men and women.\nBest Fashion Designers\nOlivier Rousteing\nOlivier Rousteing is a French fashion designer. At age 24 as a relatively unknown designer, Rousteing took over as creative director of Balmain. Since his induction in 2011, the label has skyrocketed to stardom due to its association with Kardashian clan.\nBest Fashion Designers\nAlexander Wang\nAlexander Wang has shifted the conversation regarding the American urban wear space. His near-perfect tailoring, penchant for black, and signature style has influenced up and comers like Hood by Air's Shayne Oliver. After establishing his own label, as well as the diffusion line \"T by Alexander Wang\", Wang took on the role of creative director at famed fashion house Balenciaga.\nBest Fashion Designers\nDiane von Fï¿½rstenberg\nDiane von Fï¿½rstenberg began designing women's clothing in 1970 and three years later introduced her iconic knit jersey wrap dress, for which she is most widely known today. Due to its influence on women's fashion, one of her wrap dresses sits proudly in a collection at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 2005, she was given a lifetime achievement award by the Council of Fashion Designers of America and named their president.\nBest Fashion Designers\nStefano and Domenico\nWhen inspiration for your first collection comes from Sophia Loren, you know you have something special. Not afraid to celebrate the curvaceous female form, the masterminds behind Dolce & Gabbana. Stefano and Domenico have created signature styles including corset dresses, gangster pinstripes and sexy black suits.     The company was started by Italian designers Domenico Dolce (born 13 August 1958 in Polizzi Generosa, Sicily) and Stefano Gabbana (born 14 November 1962 in Milan). By 2005 their turnover was ?597 million.[2] The two met in Milan in 1980 and worked for the same fashion house. In 1982 they established a designer consulting studio; in time it grew to become ?Dolce & Gabbana?.   While they have produced menswear collections, they will always be known for their desire to make a woman look and feel \"fantastically sexy,\" and stand out as Hollywood's number one choice of designer.\nBest Fashion Designers\nValentino\nLike Cher or Madonna, Valentino Garavani is better known simply as Valentino. Born in northern Italy in 1932, Valentino was infatuated with fashion at an early age, gaining apprenticeships and training with many local designers. After a stint in Paris working under notable fashion designers Valentino started moved to Rome where his signature scarlet dresses that have since became his trademark was born. Then in the sixties, Valentino took a risk that ultimately catapulted him into stardom: he sent Jacqueline Kennedy a series of his pieces. The First Lady was enamored by the designs and even chose to wear one of his dresses when she married her second husband.  While currently retired and residing in Rome, he remains a significant figure in the fashion world for his timeless designs and truly inspired taste.\nBest Fashion Designers\nRiccardo Tisci\nRelatively new in the fashion world, Italian-born Riccardo Tisci is already making quite the impact. Having graduated from London's Central Saint Martins Academy in 1999, he was soon picked up as Creative Director for Givenchy womenswear and haute couture. After success in this position, he was also named as menswear and accessories designer of the Givenchy men's division in 2008. Adding street style (and a touch of Goth) to luxury garments has drawn new attention and fans to the Givenchy Brand. With youthful energy that is at times melancholic, Riccardo Tisci has made this respected French fashion house his own, and there is certainly more to come.\nBest Fashion Designers\nDonatella Versace\nDonatella Versace, younger sister of Gianni Versace, is the current Vice-President and chief designer of the Versace Group. In the 70s she followed Gianni to Florence on his pursuit of knitwear design. Instead of doing public relations for him, she ended up serving better as his \"muse and critic.\" After Gianni's death in 1997, Donatella went on to spread the Versace name throughout Europe and the U.S., making her A-list celebrity friends the image and persona of the brand.\nBest Fashion Designers\nOscar de la Renta\nBorn in 1932 and trained by the famous Cristobal Balenciaga and Antonio Castillo, Oscar de la Renta (or Oscar Aristides de la Renta Fiallo) first gained international acclaim after he become one of the couturiers to dress First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1960's. Combining his Latin American passion and adoration for bright and festive colors and an exquisite eye for luxury fabrics and embellishments, Oscar de la Renta has a truly innate ability to design beautifully feminine garments. Perhaps most well-known for his red-carpet gowns, Oscar's eponymous fashion house continues to dress some of the most notable celebrities and leading women of our time\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nOfficial profile of London based fashion designer Stella McCartney ... the daughter of Paul ...

She is a British fashion designer. Stella has always been fascinated by fashion. As a teenager, she was always mixing up bits and pieces for antique clothing markets with Cerruti or Lacoste, or whatever she could find in her mother's cupboards.\nAt the age of 13, Stella constructed her first jacket. At 15, she was apprenticing at Christian Lacroix and soon after was awarded a place at St. Martins. She was almost instantly successful, with her graduation collection being sported at the graduation show by supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell. The show made front-page news, and the entire collecton was sold to Tokio, a London boutique. After graduating from Central St. Martins, London, she did a short, unofficial, apprenticeship with Edward Sexton, a Savile Row tailor.\nIn 1997 McCartney was appointed chief designer at Paris fashion house Chloe, following in the footsteps of Karl Lagerfeld. She started with the Autumn/Winter 1997 collection, and has been an astounding success. A Chloe boutique has opened in London, though it is hoped that Stella can have more control on the London end than she does on the Paris end. The rather elderly staff at Paris Chloe are pretty rigid about underclothes on the models, and see-through dresses (they are against them). Stella McCartney is a strict vegetarian and PETA supporter like her mother Linda, who died in 2000. She had a contract with Chloe that she need never work with fur or leather. All the shoes are made of vinyl or plastics, all the bags and belts of fabric or raffia. Her soft romantic clothes have been very successful at Chloe. For the Spring 2000 collection, she has created several designs with cut-work rhinestone necklines and bodices.\nIn the year 2000, Stella McCartney was approached by Tom Ford of Gucci, with an offer of financial support so that she could set up her own label. She agreed to this, and left Chloe. Her assistant at Chloe, Phoebe Philo, took over the designing at Chloe. Stella was looking for an artist to illustrate her new venture. She saw a 1972 sketch made by British artist David Remfry, and after seeing his work, decided that he was the one. In 2002 Remfry prepared the McCartnery adverts which appeared in all the leading fashion magazines. The sketches were so eye-catching and sexy that they blew the whole industry away.\nIn August 2003, Stella married her long-time love publisher Alasdhair Willis. The setting was a castle on the island of Bute, in the river Clyde, in Scotland, loaned to them by the Marquis of Bute (racing driver Johnny Dumfries). Stella's father, former Beatle Paul McCartney paid around 2 million pounds, as father of the bride. Stella designed her own wedding gown, using as inspiration the one worn by her mother when she married in 1969. In February 2005, the couple had a baby boy just before Stella will be presenting her Fall/Winter 2005 collection in Paris. They have called him Miller Alisdhair James Willis. Stella took time out from preparations for her Spring/Summer 2004 collection in Paris, to fly over to the United States for the opening of her new Los Angeles store.\nIn September 2004, it was announced that Stella has formed a collaboration with Adidas to design a new collection of stylish, high-tech gym wear after working with experts for ideas for runners, swimmers and athletes.\nHigh Street fashion giant H&M announced in May 2005 that Stella McCartney would design a 40 piece collection for them in the Autumn. They find her designs modern, cool, classic and wearable. In September H & M started selling the McCartney range, with great success. She has selected one or two things from her own label collections, but of course the cost is much lower in the High Street. This should lead to Stella's clothes finding a much wider market. Margareta van den Bosch, head of design at H & M said that the company was thrilled to collaborate with Stella.\nthe label\nStella launched her new house with the Spring 2002 collection, presenting clothes emblazoned with rhyming Cockney slang, that had the punchy tang of a hit from the word go. She got her label off to a snappy start in front of Domenico de Sole, the boss of the Gucci group, and McCartney's partner. Her brand new 4000 sq ft store in Manhattan opened in September 2002, housing her ready-to-wear, shoe and accessories collections. It has an inlaid pool running the length of the store and walls of hand-painted fabric. There was a fabulous party to celebrate the opening. The financial results for Stella's new company for the first year of operation, were not very good. It suffered losses of 2.7 million pounds. However GUCCI, who own her label, have absolute faith in her and said that they have high hopes for her future. In late November, Stella's owners GUCCI appointed a new CEO for Stella McCartney. He is Marco Bizzari (born 1962) a well-experienced financial and managerial man. He is expected to push the profits up even higher.\nWho Wears It\nAnnie Lennox, Gwyneth Paltrow, Pamela Anderson\nPerfumes\n2006 Stella In Two (W)\nProfile\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nWhile some may think that being the daughter of one of the world's most famous, ... designer Stella McCartney might ... show with Chloe, in the fall of 1997, ... Stella McCartney Facts, information, pictures ... Stella McCartney facts, information, pictures | Encyclopedia.com articles about Stella McCartney\nSeptember 13, 1971 • London, England\nFashion designer\nWhile some may think that being the daughter of one of the world's most famous, respected, and wealthy rock stars would lead to plentiful advantages when building a career, British designer Stella McCartney might not completely agree. McCartney, daughter of Sir Paul—who happens to be a former member of the Beatles, perhaps the most popular and influential rock band ever—has talent and ambition to spare, but her fame-by-association has caused many to speculate that it is her family connections rather than her design collections that have propelled her career. Being a McCartney has its advantages—through family acquaintances, a teenaged Stella made important connections in the design world—but had she been lacking in talent and business sense, such connections would have been meaningless. Instead, McCartney proved that her combination of creativity, sense of style, and understanding of the fashion industry could make her a powerful force in fashion regardless of her parentage.\nIn 1997, less than two years after graduating from college, McCartney made headlines when she was hired as the creative director for Chloe, a respected design house in Paris , France . She spent four years at Chloe, helping to redefine the company's image and increasing the company's sales by appealing to young, hip consumers. In 2001 McCartney left Chloe to start her own company in partnership with the celebrated Gucci Group. She spent the following years issuing new collections, opening boutiques in New York , London, and Los Angeles , and, in 2003, launching a new fragrance line called Stella.\n\"I have a vision for the way I want a woman to dress, perhaps because I'm a woman and know what I like to wear.... It's not about what it looks like in the studio or on the runway. It's what it looks like on a real person that matters.\"\nDown on the farm\nMcCartney was born in London in 1971, not long after the breakup of the Beatles. Her father, a musician of exceptional talent, went on to form the band Wings, in which her mother, Linda, played keyboards and sang backup. Linda McCartney also became known for her skilled photographic portraits of musicians and other subjects, and was an outspoken advocate for animal rights as well as an accomplished vegetarian cook and cookbook writer. While the McCartneys led an unconventional life, traveling around the world on tour with the band with their children in tow, they were determined that their home base would be a tranquil refuge from the rock-and-roll lifestyle. The family, including Stella, her half-sister Heather (from Linda McCartney's first marriage), sister Mary, and brother James, moved to a farm by the time Stella was ten years old. Living in a modest farmhouse, the family raised sheep, rode horses, and grew organic produce. Stella was heavily influenced by the family's back-to-nature lifestyle and    her parents' values, becoming a vegetarian herself as well as a committed animal rights activist.\nNext-Generation Jagger\nJade Jagger, jewelry designer and famous offspring, has encountered much of the same skepticism that Stella McCartney has faced. As the daughter of Mick Jagger (1943–), lead singer of the Rolling Stones, and Bianca Jagger, a symbol of high fashion, Jade has struggled to establish an identity separate from that of her world-famous parents. Even as she has forged a successful design career, she still has critics suggesting that her professional accomplishments are due to her fame as a Jagger rather than her own talent.\nBorn in 1972, Jagger certainly had an unconventional upbringing as the daughter of one of rock music's most notorious bad boys. Her father has provided material for tabloid newspapers for most of his adult life, with one high-profile and stormy relationship after another (Mick and Bianca divorced around 1980). As a teenager Jade acquired a reputation for being a bit wild herself. She made headlines in 1988 when she was expelled from a prestigious private school in England for sneaking out to meet her boyfriend. And she was known for throwing, and attending, great parties. Jagger's lifestyle mellowed a bit when she became a mother in the early 1990s; she now has two daughters, Assisi and Amba.\nJagger has done some modeling and has long been a part of the fashion scene, but her vocation is designing jewelry. Jagger started her own company, Jade Inc., in 1998, creating and selling fine jewelry with a modern twist. In 2002 Jagger was hired as the creative director for the upscale British jewelry company Garrard. Once the Crown Jewelers—those responsible for crowns, tiaras, and other decorative items worn by British royalty—Garrard is a long-established traditional company that was formerly known as Asprey & Garrard. When those controlling the company split the brands into two separate firms, it was decided that Garrard, while remaining a provider of expensive luxury items, would also try to reach out to a younger and more informal crowd. Jagger was seen as the right person to navigate the company through this new territory.\nIn a 2002 article in WWD, Samantha Conti wrote that Jagger's goal at Garrard was to \"blend the classic and the avant-garde, which means that blue diamond tiaras sell alongside funky gold dog tags, the rocks on some rings roll—literally—in a see-saw motion, and pendants are inspired by hip-hop and heraldry.\" Jagger designed a line of jewelry that playfully incorporated royal symbols such as crowns and family crests. While Jagger will never completely escape associations with her famous dad, she has forged a successful career independent of her family connections, earning praise for her funky and fashionable creations.\nMcCartney had known ever since her early teen years that she wanted to be a fashion designer; she was designing and making clothes by age thirteen. At age fifteen she had a brief internship in Paris with acclaimed designer Christian LaCroix. Later, during her university years, McCartney became an apprentice to tailor Edward    Sexton, learning the finer points of tailoring on London's famed Savile Row, home to numerous traditional and highly respected custom clothing companies. She briefly worked at the French company Patou, makers of expensive custom-made clothes, but left the company in objection to their use of fur in some of their products.\nMcCartney attended Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London. Along with her fellow design students, McCartney designed a line of clothing to be displayed in a student fashion show as part of a graduation project. Like many of the other students, McCartney enlisted some friends to model her clothing during the show. Unlike her peers, however, McCartney's friends were supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss. Her models' fame, as well as her own celebrity stemming from her family ties (and the presence of her famous parents in the audience), attracted hordes of reporters and photographers from all over the world to the student show. Many of the other students resented the circus atmosphere and the fact that the press left the show immediately after McCartney's clothes had been shown. Some in the media and the fashion industry speculated that the extraordinary attention the young designer received had everything to do with her last name and little to do with her talent as a designer. But buyers for a number of upscale department stores, including Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, disagreed, buying McCartney's line for sale in their stores.\nA rapid rise\nAfter her 1995 college graduation, McCartney opened her own boutique in London to sell her designs. Her designs featured a mix of crisp tailoring with lacy, romantic pieces, a combination that conveyed a sense of strong femininity. Her specialties were slip dresses and luxurious swishy silk skirts. \"My mom always collected thrift-shop stuff—especially Italian slips,\" McCartney related to Time magazine's Ginia Bellafante. \"I've always loved underwear and antique fabrics and lace for all their soft texture.\" Her designs were snapped up by fashion-conscious shoppers, including models, actresses, and musicians. In December of 1996, a man came into McCartney's boutique describing himself as the owner of a clothing store in Rome , Italy. He asked extensive questions about her collection and her ideas     on how to sell fashions to women of all ages, and was impressed by McCartney's thorough understanding of quality clothing as well as the marketing of such items. He later introduced himself as Mounir Moufarrige, president of the long-admired Parisian design firm Chloe. Moufarrige, eager to revive his struggling company by appealing to consumers younger and hipper than Chloe's traditional customers, had traveled to McCartney's shop to meet the woman who had been generating so much buzz.\nWeeks later, Moufarrige offered the twenty-five-year-old designer a job as creative director of Chloe. Many in the fashion industry, including esteemed designer Karl Lagerfeld, who had previously held McCartney's position at Chloe, felt outraged that Moufarrige had hired a young and untested designer for such a significant position. McCartney     soon silenced her critics, however, by bringing tremendous visibility and success to Chloe. Beginning with her first successful show with Chloe, in the fall of 1997, McCartney displayed her signature style of clean lines combined with delicate and sexy pieces. Critics acknowledged that her designs were not terribly bold or innovative, but they held tremendous appeal for consumers. McCartney not only improved the fortunes of Chloe, she also helped usher in a new trend in women's clothing that favored romantic, flirtatious styles over the plainer, nofrills look popular in the early 1990s. Just two years after she joined Chloe, Robin Givhan wrote in the Washington Post that under McCartney's direction, \"Chloe has not just gotten substantially better. It has been transformed.\" McCartney's professional success, however, was tempered by personal tragedy during this period. In 1998 her mother died after a three-year battle with breast cancer.\nIn 2000 McCartney won the VH1/Vogue Fashion and Music Designer of the Year Award. During that same year, she designed a bridal gown for one of the most high-profile weddings in the celebrity world—that of pop superstar (and McCartney pal) Madonna to filmmaker Guy Ritchie. During 2001 McCartney led Chloe in a new direction, overseeing the introduction of a more casual, less expensive clothing line called See. Her success at Chloe and increasing name recognition as a designer to watch generated numerous rumors that McCartney would not stay at the Paris company much longer. Her rapid rise through the ranks of the fashion industry led many to believe that she would soon strike out on her own and, after four years with the Paris firm, McCartney did in fact leave. She had struck a deal with the renowned Gucci Group to start her own design house.\nThe ups and downs of independence\nMcCartney wasted no time creating the first line for her new company, which bears her name and is half owned by Gucci. Just a few months after striking out on her own in the fall of 2001, she showed her first collection. The reception was not exactly favorable. McCartney deviated from her signature style, as reported by Lisa Armstrong at New York Metro.com: \"McCartney, who'd become a reliable source of lovely, easy-on-the-eye garments, chose this moment to replace her stock-in-trade flirtiness with something more hard-core.\" Armstrong    pointed out that the timing of the show did not help matters; it took place one month after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City and Washington, D.C., a time when people sought comfort, not confrontation. Fashion journalists wrote harsh reviews of the show, with McCartney's critics reiterating their opinion that the designer was famous simply because of her name. With her next few collections, however, McCartney once again proved her critics wrong. She returned to her roots, focusing on designing clothes that made women feel and look good.\nIn the fall of 2002 McCartney opened her first store, in New York City, to feature her new company's designs. Her second store opened the following spring in London, with a third opening in the Los Angeles area in the fall of 2003. In the stores, which are called simply \"Stella McCartney,\" she sells her clothing as well as shoes, bags, and other accessories, including her own perfume, a scent called Stella. All of her products reflect McCartney's dedication to animal rights and other causes. In her clothing designs she emphasizes cottons and silks. Not one of her products, including shoes and bags, is made out of leather or fur. The company manufacturing her fragrance is prohibited from using genetically modified materials—that is, plants that have been altered by humans—and will not accept plants that were harvested by children or that are on any endangered species list. McCartney attributes her socially conscious attitude to the earthy styles of her parents, particularly her mother. She has also credited her mother with informing her fashion sensibility: the confidence to wear clothes she loves rather than following trends, a combination of vintage and modern looks, and the choice of a natural look over a highly polished one. Describing her mother's naturalness to Shane Watson of Harper's Bazaar, McCartney noted: \"You look at people in her position now, and they're all manicured and their hair's straightened, and she was so not that, ever. She never waxed her legs, never dyed her hair, and that is so rare.... I mean, my mum really was the coolest chick in the world.\"\nWhile the loss of her mother was devastating, McCartney has also experienced much personal and professional happiness in recent years. In August of 2003 she wed magazine publisher Alasdhair Willis in a small but elaborate ceremony. Taking place on a three-hundred-acre estate on the Scottish island of Bute, the wedding featured truck-loads of white roses imported from the Netherlands , a bagpipe band,    and a fireworks display. Guests—including such celebrity pals as Gwyneth Paltrow, Liv Tyler, and Madonna—were transported in carriages pulled by Clydesdale horses. A large team of security guards kept the press at bay, ensuring a calm and private affair. On the professional front, McCartney has achieved increasing success with each new collection. Tom Ford, the former creative director of Gucci, told Armstrong why he has so much confidence in McCartney: \"She has everything it takes to be successful—the drive, the will, and the intelligence. She has great style, great taste.\"\nFor More Information\nPeriodicals\n\"And I Love Her.\" People (September 15, 2003): p. 66.\nBellafante, Ginia. \"Tired of Chic Simple?
