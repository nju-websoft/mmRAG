It was during the Spanish Civil War that Mars purportedly encountered soldiers eating small chocolate beads encased in a hard sugar shell as part of their rations. In an age when sales of chocolate typically dropped off during summer months due to the lack of air conditioning, Forrest was thrilled by the prospect of developing a product that would be able to resist melting in high temperatures. He returned to the United States and, shortly thereafter, approached Bruce Murrie, the son of Hershey executive William Murrie, to join him in his new business venture. Anticipating a shortage of chocolate and sugar as World War II raged on in Europe, Mars sought a partnership that would ensure a steady supply of resources to produce his new candy. In return, Murrie was given a 20 percent stake in the M&M product, which was named to represent ‘Mars’ and ‘Murrie.’\nIn March of 1941, Mars was granted a patent for his manufacturing process and production began in Newark, New Jersey. Originally sold in cardboard tubes, M&M’s were covered with a brown, red, orange, yellow, green or violet coating. After the United States entered the war, the candies were exclusively sold to the military, enabling the heat-resistant and easy-to-transport chocolate to be included in American soldiers’ rations. By the time the war was over and GIs returned home, they were hooked.\nShortly after wartime quotas ended and the candies were made available to the general public, Forrest Mars bought out Murrie’s shares in the company and took sole ownership of the M&M brand. The familiar brown bag package that remains in use today was introduced in 1948. In 1950, the candies were imprinted with a black “m” (which changed to white in 1954) and customers were encouraged to “Look for the M on every piece” to ensure they were getting the real thing. Peanut M&M’s made their debut in 1954, along with the cartoon characters Mr. Plain and Mr. Peanut, and by 1956 M&M’s had become the No. 1 candy in the United States.\nIn 1964, Forrest merged his various businesses (which by then included pet food and rice, among other products) with his father’s company, Mars Inc., and soon began to phase out external chocolate suppliers like Hershey’s. Upon request by the crew aboard NASA’s first space shuttle, Columbia, M&M’s were the first candy to rocket into space in 1981. Three years later, they were advertised as the Official Snack of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Today, the crowd-pleasing and satisfying candies continue to sweeten a soldier’s day as a welcome part of their individual Meal, Ready to Eat (MRE) field ration\nTags\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nThree Types of Business ...

It is an idea worth    considering, for several reasons. People who\nstart up a business gain the opportunity    to work at something that they really love, the power to control their work    life, the ability to build something new, and the potential to earn a lot of    money.\nTASK\nInvestigate the three major forms of business organization: sole proprietorships,      partnerships, and corporations.\nOffer advice to people interested in beginning or expanding a business.\nResearch and prepare a report on a successful businessperson and the business      she or he they founded.\nPROCESS\nActivity 1: Three Types of Business Organization\nThere are many different goods and services that a new business can offer, but there are only only a few ways to organize a business. The vast majority of businesses start out as sole proprietorships or partnerships. A third option is to set up a corporation. In the United States, about 70 percent of all businesses are sole proprietorships, 20 percent are corporations and the remaining 10 percent are partnerships. Each type of business has distinctive characteristics.\nA sole proprietorship a business that is owned and managed by one individual who receives all the profits and bears all losses.\nA partnership a business that is owned and managed by two or more individuals who receive all profits and bear all losses.\nA corporation is a business that is owned by stockholders and that has legal rights and responsibilities as if it were a person.\nAn entrepreneur is a person who starts up a new business, taking on risk and hoping to make a profit.\nRead more, at this Small Business Planner website, about each type including their advantages and disadvantages.\nActivity 2: Sweet Opportunities\nImagine you operate a consulting business, giving advice to people who are thinking about starting or expanding their own business. Read the client stories in this file, Sweet Opportunities , then prepare a written recommendation as to which form of business organization you think is best for each. State the reasons for your recommendations. In each case, there will be some disadvantages to the business form you recommend. Identify at least one negative for each and suggest how the client you might minimize its effects.\nAs you prepare your report, keep in mind that starting a business involves more than just finding something to sell. The entrepreneur may need money may be needed for buildings, equipment and other start-up expenses. He or she must also know how to manage the business, or find someone else to work as a manager.\nIf you need additional information to help you make your recommendations, click on the titles below:\n\"What Type of Business Organization is Best for You?\"\nActivity 3: Sweet Success\nYou have probably noticed that all of your clients had opportunities in the “sweets” industry.

Industry Market Trends - ThomasNet News\nIndustry Market Trends\n5 Sweet Facts about Candy\nBy David Butcher\nOctober 26, 2010\nDo you know why candy corn became so popular? How about the origin of the \"m\" on M&Ms? Do the repetitive sounds of \"Kit Kat\" and \"Jelly Belly\" hold the secret to successful brands? Unwrap these and other candy secrets.\nFor candy producers, Halloween is the sweetest holiday of the year\n, beating Easter, Valentine's Day and Christmas in candy sales. In 2007\n, firms producing chocolate and cocoa treats shipped $14.4 billion worth of products. Meanwhile, non-chocolate confectionery manufacturing was a $5.6 billion industry.\nDid You Know? The Snickers candy bar was named after a horse owned by the Mars family.\nIn 2008\n, there were 1,317 U.S. manufacturing establishments making chocolate and cocoa products, employing 38,369 people. California led the nation in the number of chocolate and cocoa manufacturers, with 146, followed by Pennsylvania, with 115. Moreover, there were 422 U.S. establishments manufacturing non-chocolate confectionery products, employing 16,860 people. California also led the nation in this category, with 47 establishments.\nDid You Know? Although no one today seems to know where Hershey's chocolate Kiss got its name, the most popular theory is that it was named for the sound or motion of the chocolate being deposited during the manufacturing process.\nConsidering that Americans consumed 24.3 lbs. of candy\nper capita last year  and are expected to spend an average of $20.29\non candy this Halloween season  it should come as little surprise that candy companies are pretty successful in the U.S.\nDid You Know? The Curtiss Candy Company, which renamed its candy bar from Kandy Kake to Baby Ruth in 1921, claims its famous chocolate was named after Grover Cleveland's daughter Ruth and not after baseball legend Babe Ruth.\nIn commemoration of Halloween, here are some more candy-related facts that you may find surprising. Why Candy Corn Became So Popular Candy corn, a Halloween staple, has been around for more than a century. In the 1880s, Philadelphia-based Wunderlee Candy Company's George Renninger invented the popular yellow, orange and white candy. In 1900, the Goelitz Candy Company, which later became the Jelly Belly Candy Company, started manufacturing the snack and continues to make it today.   \"When candy corn first appeared, it was popular among farmers because of its agrarian look,\" according to the National Confectioners Association\n(NCA). \"The tri-color design was considered revolutionary and the public went crazy for it. Lack of machinery meant that candy corn was only made seasonally from March to November.\"   More than 35 million lbs.  nearly 9 billion pieces  of the kernel-shaped candy were produced last year. The Halloween season accounts for 75 percent of the annual candy corn production. In fact, October 30 has been designated National Candy Corn Day\n.   Here's how it's made:\nOrigin of the \"M\" on M&Ms M&Ms candy was innovative in that its hard sugary coating prevented the candy from melting in the hot sun long before air-conditioning. Forrest Mars, Sr. (whose father, Frank Mars, operated a successful candy business of his own) received a patent for his manufacturing process in 1941 and, to fund the candy's launch, entered into a partnership with Bruce Murrie (the son of Hershey executive William Murrie). Mars eventually purchased Murrie's shares in the venture and became one of Hershey's primary competitors.   M&Ms actually stands for \"Mars & Murrie's,\" the last names of the candy's creators. The candy hasn't always had an \"m\" stamped on one side. Even though M&Ms chocolates were first introduced in 1941, the \"m\" didn't appear on the candy until 1950. And it used to be a black \"m,\" not white like it is today, M&Ms' own timeline\nsays. According to the Q&A column the Straight Dope\n, the letter \"m\" is printed on each candy with a simple vegetable dye using a process \"akin to offset printing.\"   Another interesting bit of trivia: Originally sold in hard cardboard tubes, the packaging changed in 1948 to the brown plastic pouch known today.   More than 400 million M&Ms chocolate candies are produced in the U.S. every day. The Secret Recipe of Gummy Bears Haribo's Gummi Bear candies have been around in one shape or another\nsince the 1920s  German candymaker Hans Riegel invented the Dancing Bear, which ultimately became the world-famous Gold-Bear product in 1967  but it wasn't until the 1980s that American markets caught on to the gummy craze. The little bears became so popular that Disney even stepped in to capitalize on the popularity, with a cartoon called The Adventures of the Gummi Bears\nthat ran until 1991.\nThe success of the original Gummibärchen (\"little rubber bear\") spawned numerous gummy animals and objects, and today there are many variations on the traditional soft, chewy and fruity bear. While research shows\nthat the Gold-Bear recipe contains four main ingredients, including glucose syrup, gelatin, sugar and dextrose, \"the exact recipe and method of production of the Haribo bears remains a closely guarded secret,\" according to Mental Floss\n.   \"And although there are many pretenders to the throne who've tried to usurp the gummy crown (Trolli, German inventors of the gummy worm, are a notable example),\" the trivia magazine says, \"Haribo remains one of the largest manufacturers of gummy in the world, if not the biggest, producing more than 80 million bears a day for distribution the globe over.\"   According to the Metro Candy Blog\n, approximately 100,000,000 Gold-Bears are produced every day. The Sweet Science of Brand Sounds Kit Kat candy bars, Jelly Belly jellybeans and Hubba Bubba bubblegum are all delicious, but there's something else in play that makes them so attractive: repetition. A study published recently in the Journal of Marketing\nfound that the sound of brands with repetitively structured names favorably affects how consumers perceive and choose items and where they buy them.   \"In one experiment, researchers used identical samples of ice cream but gave them two different names  one that contained repetition and another that did not,\" Business News Daily\nreports. \"Study participants more frequently chose the ice cream with the repetitive-sounding name.\"   Although savvy marketers have been using the tactic for years, the study provides the first evidence of its effectiveness.   \"In six experiments, the current research provides the first evidence that positive affect arising from certain types of brand names influences consumers,\" the study says. \"In general, we find across multiple brand names and product categories that brand names containing phonetic sound repetition that are spoken aloud elicit positive affect, which in turn has implications for consumer evaluations and choices.\"   Still, marketers beware: The researchers also found names that stray too far from natural linguistic sounds (for example, a restaurant called \"ranthfanth\") can induce negative reactions. Which U.S. President Loved His Jellybeans? Jelly Belly was the favorite candy\nof President Ronald Reagan, who eventually made the beans a staple in the Oval Office and on Air Force One. During his presidency, there was even a special holder designed for the plane so the jar of Jelly Belly beans would not spill during turbulence.   Moreover, Jelly Belly beans became the first jellybeans in outer space when President Reagan sent them on the 1983 flight of the space shuttle Challenger \"as a presidential surprise for the astronauts,\" according to the candy maker's website\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nThe History of Candy timeline. ... 1911 Ethel and Frank Mars open a candy company in Tacoma, Washington. ... 1941 Bruce Murrie, ...

Franklin Mars, ... (son of William Murrie, Hershey president). In 1941 M&M’s were introduced to the public. History of M&M's Candy and World War II - HubPages History of M&M's Candy and World War II\nHistory of M&M's Candy and World War II\nUpdated on January 29, 2014\nM&M's The History of This Candy\nThe History, Mystery, and Myths of the chocolate candy called M&M’s\nIt was March 3, 1941, Pearl Harbor hadn’t happened yet, but M&M’s were just patented, and the world would never be the same.\nFranklin Mars, also known as Frank Mars, started the family candy business in 1902. In 1911, he started Mar-O-Bar, which eventually became Mars Candy Company. He invented the Milky Way candy bar, and the Snickers candy bar, which he named for the family horse. A few years later he invented the Three Musketeers Bar.\nFrank’s son Forrest was brought into the family business, but did not get along with his father. Forrest was sent to Europe to run the company overseas. It was there, rumor has it, that Forrest observed soldiers during the Spanish-Civil War, eating chocolate pieces encased in a hard sugar candy shell. He was traveling with another man from the Rowntree family, who ended up inventing a similar candy in 1937, that Nestle’s manufactures in Europe.\nForrest Mars created a recipe for M&M’s. He proposed a partnership with Bruce Murrie (son of William Murrie, Hershey president). In 1941 M&M’s were introduced to the public. The M&M stand for each of the initials in their last names.They were an instant success, and propelled M&M Mars, Inc.into a multibillion dollar, multinational candy company. The chocolate candies came in 6 different colors ~ Brown, Yellow, Orange, Red, Green and Violet.\nSweet Gifts\n \nM&M's Do Their Part In World War II\nIn 1942, 200,000 pounds of M&M’s were produced weekly in their Newark, NJ factory, most of it going to the military. Soldiers in WWII carried the m&m's with them. By the end of the war, the factory was producing 600,000 lbs each week. In 1946, with the war over, M&M’s was readily available to the general population. In 1947, a ¼ lb bag of m&m’s was sold for 15 cents.\nIn 1950, the famous ‘m’ was printed on each candy in black, so that consumers could tell the “real thing” from imitators. In the 1950’s the factory was producing a million lbs of m&m’s per week. The factory was running 24 hours a day. M&M’s was becoming a household word, and with tv advertising on the horizon, M&M’s would continue to grow in popularity. M&M's with peanuts were introduced in 1954, and the ‘m’ was printed in white, as it still is today. This same year, “the milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand” became their advertising slogan. By 1958, over one million lbs of m&m’s were being consumed.\nIn 1960, 3 additional colors were added to the chocolate peanut m&m’s, yellow, green and red. In 1972, we were introduced to the M&M brand characters. In 1976, orange m&m color was added to the chocolate peanut version. Due to public awareness about the unsafe ingredients in red food dye used at the time, Mars eliminated the red candy from the bag in 1976.\nSince 1981, m&m’s have gone into space over 30 times as part of the food supply for astronauts. M&M’s became the official candy of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. In 1987, the red color was re-introduced in the bag of candy. It was overwhelming received by the consumers. In the 1980’s the company expanded into the European and Austrailian markets. The almond m&m’s were introduced in 1988 during Christmas and Easter. Due to their popularity, these chocolate candies started to be sold year round in 1992.\n1990 was another landmark year as peanut butter cream m&m candies delighted children and adults of all ages. Chocolate Chip cookies could now be made with baking bits M&M’s in 1995. 1996, mini m&m’s in a reclosable plastic container, came to market, making it more portable, and convenient to consume and carry the m&m’s around.\nIn 2000 M&Ms declared themselves the official candy of the millennium since MM is 2000 in Roman numerals. In 2002, purple joined the assorted mix of colors.Today, the factories produce over 400 million M&M’s in all the different varieties and all the different colors.\n \nHow M&M's are Made\nM&M’s has been one of the most successful candies sold in American history. The company has been extremely successful through well done advertising. Of course, the taste and size make it palatable to snack on, and this has contributed to it being such a successful candy.\nM&M’s consist of 2 parts. There is a hardened liquified chocolate and then there is the candy exterior candy. The chocolate is a combination of chocolate liquor ( a thick liquid made from cocoa butter and the soft parts of the cocoa beans), cocoa butter, milk, and sugar, plus some additional ingredients. The candy shell is a combination of sugar and corn syrup.\nThe liquidy chocolate is put into small rounded molds. This makes up the chocolate centers. With the nut candies, chocolate coats the whole peanut or almond center. In the M&M’s with peanut butter, the chocolate envelopes the peanut butter for the delicious center flavor. In the manufacturing, the chocolate candies are tumbled to make the chocolate center smooth. They are then left to harden, and placed on a conveyor belt to be coated. They are sprayed with several coats of the candy coating to make the outer shell. Finally a color is added to the last syrup spray. M&M’s are made in batches of the same color. The colors are all mixed together, and moved on a conveyor belt where the trademark ‘m’ is gently printed on each candy.\nSometimes the ‘m” doesn’t get imprinted, due to a small variation in the shape of some candies. Imperfectly shaped candies are removed. (I wonder who gets to eat them?) The candies are then weighed and a package is filled with the assorted colors, then the bag is heat sealed. According to the company, the colors of Milk Chocolate M&M’s has 30% brown, 20 % yellow, 20 % red, 10 % green, 10 % orange, and 10 % blue colors. (In 1995, America voted for a new color for the M&M candies color and blue won by 54%.) Different varieties of M&M candies have different percent of color mix in each bag.\n \nM&M's: Their Impact On The World\nWe have gotten to know the M&M  characters and their charming personalities. We can visit M&M World Retail Stores. M&M’s can be imprinted with personal messages.  The future of M&M’s will continue to bring us new and innovative experiences.\nAfter all of this M&M knowledge, did this chocolate candy really change the world?  No one can say for sure, but maybe it did. Did M&M’s perhaps help us win WWII? Maybe, it certainly didn’t hurt the war effort.  Did M&M’s help avert an earlier economic downturn?  Perhps it is worth considering  that the amount of consumer  purchases may have helped keep the economy going longer. Did M&M’s inspire greatness in scientific discoveries, or helped  us be happier,and keep   our spirits up, due to the delectable taste of these candies? Have marketing geniuses been made because of M&M’s outstanding advertising campaign? Have M&M’s helped conserve water due to less mess because they “melt in your mouth, not in your hand”?  We may never know if M&M’s candies changed the world, all I know is that now I having a craving for M&M’s!\nTake This Poll\n\n"
