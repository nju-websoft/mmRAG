What is the biggest animal ever to exist on Earth ... What is the biggest animal ever to exist on Earth? | HowStuffWorks\nWhat is the biggest animal ever to exist on Earth?\nSebastien Burel/ Dreamstime.com\nBy considerable measure, the largest known animal on Earth is the blue whale . Mature blue whales can measure anywhere from 75 feet (23 m) to 100 feet (30.5 m) from head to tail, and can weigh as much as 150 tons (136 metric tons). That's as long as an 8- to 10-story building and as heavy as about 112 adult male giraffes! These days, most adult blue whales are only 75 to 80 feet long; whalers hunted down most of the super giants. Female blue whales generally weigh more than the males. The largest blue whale to date is a female that weighed 389,760 pounds (176,792 kg).\nA blue whale's head is so wide that an entire professional football team -- about 50 people -- could stand on its tongue. Its heart is as big as a small car , and its arteries are wide enough that you could climb through them. Even baby blue whales dwarf most animals. At birth, a blue whale calf is about 25 feet (7.6 m) long and weighs more than an elephant. And they do grow up fast: During the first 7 months of its life, a blue whale drinks approximately 100 gallons (379 liters) of its mother's milk per day, putting on as much as 200 pounds (91 kg) every 24 hours. An adult blue whale can eat more than 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) of krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature, every day.\nA Whale of a World\nMarine Mammal Quiz\nThis puts blue whales well above any known land mammal in terms of size. Most people believe that the largest animals to ever exist on Earth were the dinosaurs . However, one of the largest land dinosaurs, the sauropod Argentinosaurus, weighed only about 180,000 pounds (81,647 kg). That's little more than half the size of an adult blue whale. It makes a lot of sense that the world's largest animal would be a sea creature. Land animals have to support their own weight, whereas sea creatures get some help from the water.\nIt is believed that at one time there were more than 200,000 blue whales. There are only about 10,000 blue whales now -- they've been on the endangered list since the mid-1960s -- and the population is not expected to recover.\n­\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nWhile no terrestrial creatures ever approached these sizes, the largest whales can make ... The blue whale is the largest animal alive on Earth ... Whales or dinosaurs: What are the biggest, heaviest ... Mamenchisaurus and other sauropods are some of the largest dinosaurs known.\nPhoto by Junko Kimura/Getty Images\nIn 1841, in the early days of paleontology, the notoriously cantankerous anatomist Richard Owen, the man who would later coin the term “dinosaur,” stood before his colleagues at the Geological Society of London to announce the discovery of an enormous extinct reptile. The monster was represented by only a smattering of fossilized bone, but Owen nevertheless ascertained that the animal’s tail bones “equaled in dimensions a middle caudal vertebra of a full-sized whale.”\nOwen’s name for the creature—Cetiosaurus, the “whale lizard”—played up the creature’s gargantuan size, and scientific showman that he sometimes was, Owen left the assembled scientists with the idea “that the surpassing bulk and strength of the Cetiosaurus were probably assigned to it with carnivorous habits, that it might keep in check the Crocodilians and Plesiosauri” that swam the same Jurassic seas.\nAdvertisement\nOwen was almost totally wrong in his initial description, but I can’t blame him. The more-complete skeletons that would show Cetiosaurus to be a one of the long-necked, herbivorous, heavy-bodied sauropods hadn’t yet been found. At least the name is still on the mark. An adult Cetiosaurus was as long as a mature male sperm whale, around 52 feet.\nOther sauropods grew even larger than that. Supersaurus, Argentinosaurus, and Diplodocus were the largest creatures to ever walk the Earth, stretching more than 100 feet from their pencil-like teeth to their sinuous tails. But that “walked the Earth” clause is important. While no terrestrial creatures ever approached these sizes, the largest whales can make sauropods look rather skinny. When it comes down to it, who can rightfully lay claim to the title of the largest animals of all time: dinosaurs or whales?\nPrehistory fan that I am , I’d love to see sauropods to go home with the title. With 45 feet of neck alone, a 110-foot-long Supersaurus would seem to be a clear winner, and there are rumors of dinosaur specimens that push the size limit even further. But the sad truth is that two factors might keep sauropods from winning out over the whales.\nFossilization was not very kind to the biggest dinosaurs. All of the heavyweight contenders are known from partial skeletons. Argentinosaurus—often cited as the largest known sauropod—is known from little more than a few vertebrae, ribs, and leg bones. Likewise, the biggest Diplodocus is a collection of vertebrae and hip bones, and Supersaurus fares only a little better with the most complete specimen consisting of vertebrae, some limb bones, and parts of the hips. And don’t even get me started on Amphicoelias—a sauropod represented by a single piece of vertebra that disappeared over a century ago but that may have belonged to a dinosaur 190 feet long. Nothing more of Amphicoelias has ever been found.\nAdvertisement\nAll of those sauropod sizes are extrapolations based on smaller species known from more complete fossils. But even if Diplodocus and company really were as long as estimated, they would have been light for their size.\nA series of air sacs extending from the lungs infiltrated the bones of these dinosaurs, helping to keep them light without sacrificing strength. While an estimated weight of 45 tons for Supersaurus sounds like a lot—especially when translated into about seven African elephants, a traditional unit of measurement for dinosaur size—that’s trim for such an enormous animal. That gives whales the advantage.\nSupersaurus weighed about as much as seven African elephants, a traditional unit of measurement for dinosaur size.\nThe blue whale is the largest animal alive on Earth today, although the exact maximum size is something of a moving target in the literature. This prodigious species is thought to be capable of reaching 110 feet in length, and the largest scientifically verified individuals on record are 89 to 98 feet long. (If you’re wondering why we don’t have more exact lengths for this living species, consider the difficulties in measuring a blue whale. A tape measure isn’t going to be much help.) That’s getting awfully close to the estimated lengths of the biggest dinosaurs.\nWeight makes all the difference. Living exclusively at sea for more than 40 million years has freed whales from the evolutionary engineering constraints that land creatures—including dinosaurs—suffered. Thanks to water’s buoyancy, whales can be far heavier without collapsing on themselves. A 100-foot-long blue whale can weigh 150 tons or more, three times heavier than a dinosaur of the same size.\nAdvertisement\nMuch as it pains me to do it, I have to hand the title of “Largest Animal of All Time” to Team Cetacea.\nBut if we look beyond the superlative, the close call between dinosaurs and whales highlights an underlying pattern in what giants can achieve.\nDisregarding tonnage, the largest sauropods and whales both reached lengths of about 100 feet. Rather than being evolutionary coincidence, this might mark an evolutionary upper bound that animals may not be able to circumvent without drastic alterations to their biology.\nIn a 2012 study , paleontologist Mathew Wedel pointed out that, much like the blue whale, sauropods such as Supersaurus likely had sensory nerves that stretched all the way from their brainstems to the tips of their tails. Such long neurons would have meant relatively long transit times for impulses traveling between brain and tail. A particularly efficient conduction speed along neurons is about 300 feet per second, which means long animals would have pretty slow reaction times. The upper limit on size could be a sign, Wedel writes, “of animals approaching the real physical and chemical limits on living systems.”\nWhales might have run into such limits. Even if life at sea could support the weight of super-whales, the constraints of biology—from nerve connections to simply acquiring enough food —might make them impossible. After five million generations and a 5,000-fold increase in size, whales may be about as big as it’s possible to be. I can only hope that someone uncovers an astoundingly huge sauropod that makes us revise what we thought we knew and puts the dinosaurs back in the running for the title.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nThe Bloop Sound: Caused by the biggest animal or creature ever?

An enormous underwater creature, many times larger than the blue whale, caused a sound so loud it was heard by scientists 3000 miles apart.  Was it a blue whale, a kraken, megalodon, colossal squid or maybe even Cthulhu awakening from his slumber?\nIn 1997, an array of hydrophones, special underwater microphones used by scientists to study happenings under the ocean, detected an extremely loud and low frequency sound that was able to be heard more than 3000 miles away from its source.\nIt was calculated to have occurred a ways west off the coast of the South American tip.\nThe sound, due to what it sounds like when sped up 16 times was dubbed \"The Bloop\" and sounds like this.\nIll play the real sound for you, which is much creepier, at the end of this video.\nDue to the frequency signature of the sound, marine biologists believe the sound was not man made from something like a bomb or due to any sort of underwater volcanic or seismic activity.  It seemed to moreso match that of some sort of underwater mammal - like the blue whale.\nThe problem is the loudest sound detected by a blue whale could only reach a little under 1000 miles...thus whatever it is that caused this sound had to be several orders of magnitude larger than the largest known living organism.\nTake this size comparison chart.  A school bus is about this size.\nA blue whale is about this size.\nWhatever produced this sound, assuming it was animal in nature had to be about this size....which is HUUUUGE.\nJust what made this sound?  Was it really a giant underwater sea creature that we have yet to discover...or perhaps something even more mysterious and foreign?\nCould there of ever even been anything that lived before that made this sound?  Let’s ask Adam over at Epic Wildlife.\nCould it have been a megalodon? Or a colossal squid?  Unlikely – as they are both much smaller than a blue whale.  And yet, no prehistoric animal ever discovered has been bigger than a blue whale.\nIt’s scarey to think how much of our ocean depths are still completely unexplored.\nThe problem with a blue whale being the culprit is that the loudest sound ever recorded by a blue whale could only just reach the range of 1000 miles.\nThus, whatever it is that caused this sound had to be several orders of magnitude larger than the largest known organism, the blue whale.\nTake this size comparison chart.  A school bus is about this size.  A blue whale is about this size. Whatever produced this sound, assuming it was animal in nature, had to eb about this size, probably a little less than the size of the Eiffel tower.\nJust what made this sound?  Was it really a giant underwater creature that we have yet to discover or perhaps something even more mysterious and foreign?\nIt is said we know much less about what lurks in the depths of our ocean than we do about outer space.\nHere is an excerpt of what the actual Bloop sound sounded like without being sped up.

I was eager to learn more about some of the largest critters to ever roam the earth, ... These animals have long ... The Largest Animals That Ever Lived on Earth - HubPages The Largest Animals That Ever Lived on Earth\nThe Largest Animals That Ever Lived on Earth\nUpdated on April 14, 2013\nSome of the largest prehistoric animals....\nI recently read about a large rodent fossil that was discovered in 2008 and it sparked my interest in large prehistoric animals. I was eager to learn more about some of the largest critters to ever roam the earth, and I was not disappointed. I did some research and decided to create a lens! Here you will find some information about the largest snake fossil ever found, an enormous frog, a gigantic kangaroo, and more. I have also provided links for more information on each beast and to some great sites on prehistoric animals and dinosaurs.\nClickable table of contents:\nThe Biggest Snake That Ever Lived\nGiant Boid Snake (Titanoboa cerrejonensis)\nIf you like snakes, you will love this one....if not, prepare to be creeped out! The fossil of the largest snake to ever live was discovered in a mine located in Columbia. The fossils indicate that this snake was 42 feet (13 meters) long and weighed 2500 pounds (1250 kg)!!! That is roughly the length of a school bus and the weight of a VW Beetle. The photo at right shows a fossilized vertebra compared to the green anaconda.\nThis prehistoric reptile is believed to have been a massive anaconda-like beast that slithered through tropical rainforests 60 million years ago and fed on primitive crocodiles. It would have suffocated its prey with a vice strong enough to crush an old car!\nClick here for even more information about this awesome snake!\nThe Boid Snake - Artists rendering compared to human\nThe Boid Snake - Artists rendering compared to human\nGiant Prehistoric Ground Marsupial\nProtemnon anak\nThis gigantic kangaroo-like marsupial \"hippo\" lived on the island Tasmania. This beast weighed 1,000 pounds (500 kg)! That's half a ton! Good thing these giants were herbivores. New data suggests they went extinct around 41,000 years ago.\nThe largest species of kangaroo alive today, the red kangaroo, can weigh up to 200 pounds. This animal would be dwarfed by the prehistoric giant!\nThe largest mammal that ever lived.....\nIs the beautiful Blue Whale!\nThe largest rodent on earth is the Capybara\nThe largest marsupial on earth is the Red Kangaroo\nBiggest Rodent That Ever Lived\nJosephoartigasia monesi\nHere it is, the largest rodent fossil to ever be discovered! This enormous rat weighed ONE TON, that's 2000 pounds (1000 kg)!! The skull of this prehistoric critter was found in Uruguay and measures 21 inches (53 centimeters) long. That would make this prehistoric beast about the size of a bull. The photo at right shows the skull size compared to a modern-day rat.\nSize of the prehistoric rodent compared to man and the capybara!\nSize of the prehistoric rodent compared to man and the capybara!\nLiving Prehistoric Animals\nGiant Prehistoric Shark\nMegalodon\nThese huge prehistoric sharks first appeared in the earth's waters about 16 million years ago. This beast may have grown to lengths over 50 feet (16 meters) and could have weighed up to 30 times MORE than the great white shark! That's 126,000 pounds (63,000 kg)!!!\nThe photo at right shows a single Megalodon tooth. The bite of this gigantic shark was strong enough to crush a car and was much stronger than the bite of Tyrannosaurus rex!\nYou can see the massiveness of Megalodon when compared to a GW shark and a human!\nEnormous Monster Whale\nI just read an article about a monstrous whale that was discovered back in 2010.  The fossils were discovered by Klaas Post in Peru's Ice desert.  This was not only a large whale, it was also believed to have shared the ancient oceans with none other than the Megalodon shark!  Although they may have co-existed, scientists don't think these two monsters would have attacked each other, but perhaps one might attack the young of another.\nThe bones of this large whale have been dated to 12 or 13 million years ago and in honor of Herman Melville's Moby Dick it has been named Leviathan melvillei.  It is estimated that this whale would have been between 13 and 18 meters (43 to 59 feet) long.  Its skull is three meters (9.8 feet) long.  Its teeth are the largest predatory teeth every found at 36 cm (14 inches) long and 12 cm (5 inches) wide.  Quite an interesting find!\nA summary of the largest organisms alive today, and some information about the largest organisms to ever live.\nIllustration by Luci Betti-Nash\nThe Largest Frog That Ever Lived\nThe bad-tempered Beelzebufo or \"devil frog\"\nThis enormous prehistoric frog once hopped about Madagascar around 70-million-years-ago and is believed to be the largest frog that ever lived. Called the Beelzebufo or \"devil frog.\" These gigantic herps were the size of a beach ball, roughly 16 inches (41 cm) high and weighing about 10 pounds (4.5 kg)!! Wonder what sounds it made? :)\nIt is believed that the devil frog probably had a very bad attitude --- given its closest living relatives, which are known to grab onto anything that moves, even humans! The beelzebufo had a strong jaw and protective shield which may have enabled it to feast upon baby dinosaurs.\nThis video is really well-done and shows a wide variety of bizarre prehistoric life!\nThe Largest Arthropod That Ever Lived - Jaekelopterus rhenaniae\nImagine a giant crayfish-like creepy-crawler that was much longer than you!! This enormous arthropod lived 390-million-years-ago and was roughly the size of a large crocodile. Scientists estimate that it was about 8.2 feet (2.5 m) long, based on the 18-inch (46 cm) fossil claw that was found in Germany. This sea scorpion likely inhabited coastal swamp waters where it was probably the top predator around --- slicing up fish and even its own kind, as arthropods are known to do.\nMore information about this giant sea scorpion!\nWhy were prehistoric critters so big?!\nWell, not all prehistoric animals were big. We just have a tendency to pay more attention to the massive animals.\nIt's thought that a larger size made animals less likely to be eaten by predators.\nAt a cost though. A larger body needs more food to sustain it, hence, large prehistoric animals were more susceptible to extinction.\nHuge Prehistoric Desert-Dwelling Penguins\nIcadyptes salasi\nThirty-five million years ago, penguins the size of humans could be found wandering a desert in Peru. This penguin did not need ice to survive! These birds reached heights of 5-feet (1.5 m). The photo at right shows this giant as compared with another prehistoric penguin, and with Peru's only living penguin, the Peruvian penguin.\nPrehistoric giant penguin skull (top) as compared to Peruvian penguin skull (bottom).\n3-Foot Giant Shrimp\nA fossil discovery in Morocco revealed that this gigantic early crustacean lived almost 30 million years longer than previously thought. The specimens found are the largest yet discovered of its kind and suggest that these shrimp-like beasts dominated pre-dinosaur seas. These shrimp-like creatures were the early off-shoot of modern crustaceans called anomalocaridids.\nJust how large were these beasts? The recent fossils reveal that they could grow to lengths of 3.3 feet (1 meter)!!! Just one would have made enough shrimp scampi to feed an army for a month.

At 30 metres (98 ft) in length and 180 metric tons (200 short tons) or more in weight, it is the largest known animal to have ever existed. The Blue Whale’s tongue weighs around 2.7 metric tons (5,952 pounds), about the size of an average Asian Elephant and its heart weighs about 600 kg (1,300 lb) and is the largest known in any animal. Not only is the heart similar size to a mini-cooper car but also comparable in weight.\n \nThe Blue Whale is thought to feed almost exclusively on small, shrimp-like creatures called Krill. During the summer feeding season the Blue Whale gorges itself, consuming an astounding 3.6 metric tons (7,900 pounds) or more each day. This means it may eat up to 40 million krill a day with a daily calorie requirement of an adult Blue Whale in the region of 1.5 million. [ Source ]\n \nThe Heaviest Land Animal in the World: The African Bush Elephant\n \n \nThe African Bush Elephant is the largest living terrestrial (land) animal, with males reaching 6 to 7.5 metres (19.7 to 24.6 ft) in length, 3.3 metres (10.8 ft) in height at the shoulder, and weighing 6 t (13,000 lb). Females are much smaller, reaching 5.4 to 6.9 metres (17.7 to 22.6 ft) in length, 2.7 metres (8.9 ft) in height at the shoulder, and weighing 3 t (6,600 lb). The adult African bush elephant generally has no natural predators due to its great size, but the calves (especially the newborn) are vulnerable to lion and crocodile attacks, and (rarely) to leopard and hyena attacks. [ Source ]\n \nThe Tallest Land Animal in the World: The Giraffe\n \nPhotograph by Luca Galuzzi – www.galuzzi.it\n \nThe giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal and the tallest living terrestrial animal in the world. It stands 5–6 m (16–20 ft) tall and has an average weight of 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) for males and 830 kg (1,800 lb) for females. The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in length, accounting for nearly half of the animal’s vertical height. The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae. [ Source ]\n \nThe Largest Carnivora in the World: The Southern Elephant Seal\n \nPhotograph by DAVID SHACKELFORD\n \nThe Southern elephant seal is the largest carnivore living today. This seals’ size shows extreme sexual dimorphism, possibly the largest of any mammal, with the males typically five to six times heavier than the females. While the females average 400 to 900 kilograms (880 to 2,000 lb) and 2.6 to 3 meters (8.5 to 9.8 ft) long, the bulls average 2,200 to 4,000 kilograms (4,900 to 8,800 lb) and 4.5 to 5.8 meters (15 to 19 ft) long. The record-sized bull, shot in Possession Bay, South Georgia on February 28, 1913, measured 6.85 meters (22.5 ft) long and was estimated to weigh 5,000 kilograms (11,000 lb).\n \nSouthern elephant seals dive repeatedly, each time for more than twenty minutes, to hunt their prey—squid and fish— at depths of 400 to 1,000 meters (1,300 to 3,300 ft). The documented diving records for the seals are nearly two hours for the duration, and more than 1,400 meters (4,600 ft) in depth. [ Source ]\n \nThe diverse order Carnivora includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, while the word “carnivore” (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), at as little as 25 grams (0.88 oz) and 11 centimetres (4.3 in), to the polar bear and southern elephant seal. [ Source ]\n \nThe Largest Reptile in the World: The Saltwater Crocodile\n \n \nThe saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), is the largest of all living reptiles. It is found in suitable habitats from Northern Australia through Southeast Asia to the eastern coast of India. An adult male saltwater crocodile’s weight is 409 to 1,000 kilograms (900–2,200 lb) and length is normally 4.1 to 5.5 metres (13–18 ft). However, mature males can exceed 6 metres (20 ft) and weigh more than 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb) and this species is the only extant crocodilian to regularly reach or exceed 4.8 metres (16 ft). The saltwater crocodile is an opportunistic apex predator capable of taking nearly any animal that enters its territory, either in the water or on dry land.

The maximum size is believed to approach 1.5 kg (3.3 lb), 55 cm (22 in) long, and the wingspan may be almost 1.8 m (5.9 ft). The Large Flying Fox (Pteropus vampyrus) is smaller in body mass and length, but it has been known to exceed the Golden-crowned species in wingspan. Specimens have been verified to 1.83 m (6.0 ft) and possibly up to 2 m (6.6 ft) in wingspan. [ Source ]\n \nPhotograph by Library of Congress\n \nOsteichthyes, also called bony fish, are a taxonomic group of fish that have bony, as opposed to cartilaginous, skeletons. The vast majority of fish are osteichthyes, which is an extremely diverse and abundant group consisting of over 29,000 species. It is the largest class of vertebrates in existence today.\n \nThe largest living bony fish is the widely distributed ocean sunfish (Mola mola). It resembles a fish head with a tail, and its main body is flattened laterally. The mature ocean sunfish has an average length of 1.8 m (5.9 ft), a fin-to-fin length of 2.5 m (8.2 ft) and an average weight of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb), although individuals up to 3.3 m (10.8 ft) in length 4.2 m (14 ft) across the fins and weighing up to 2,300 kg (5,100 lb) have been observed. [ Source ]\n \nThe Heaviest Flying Bird in the World: The Dalmatian Pelican\n \nPhotograph by Doug Janson\n \nThe Dalmatian Pelican (Pelecanus crispus) is a member of the pelican family. It breeds from southeastern Europe to India and China in swamps and shallow lakes. This is the largest of the pelicans, averaging 160–180 cm (63-70 inches) in length, 11–15 kg (24-33 lbs) in weight and just over 3 m (10 ft) in wingspan. With a mean weight of 11.5 kg (25 lb), it is the world’s heaviest flying bird species on average, although large male bustards and swans can exceed the pelican in maximum weight. [ Source ]\n\n"
