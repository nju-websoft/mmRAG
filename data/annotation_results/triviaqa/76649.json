                "Answer Analysis": "The answer to the query is Pittsburgh.",
                "Document Content Analysis": "The document discusses the Pittsburgh Steelers, providing historical details about the team's Legends and All-Time teams, as well as the selection process and notable players pre-1970. It heavily focuses on the Steelers' history and their importance in the Pittsburgh sports landscape.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document explicitly mentions 'Steelers' multiple times and references 'Pittsburgh', a key identifier for the city.",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document directly mentions 'Pittsburgh', which is the answer to the query. It also heavily elaborates on the connection between the Steelers and Pittsburgh.",
