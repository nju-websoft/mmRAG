The airline said it knew of no survivors.\nThe passengers included at least 36 Syracuse University students of a group of 38 who purchased tickets for the flight. An unknown number of American military personnel flying home for the holidays were also reported to have been aboard.\nThe plane was flying at 31,000 feet when it suddenly disappeared from radar and crashed into two rows of houses, setting them on fire. There was no immediate indication of the cause of the crash. British officials would not respond to speculation by some about a structural failure or an on-board explosion in the jumbo jet.\nFlight Originated in Germany\nPat Coffey, a spokesman for the British Royal Air Force, said the plane, Pan American World Airways Flight 103, left Heathrow Airport outside London after originating at Frankfurt, West Germany, and was bound for Kennedy International Airport.\nAmong those on board was the chief administrative officer of the United Nations' Council for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson of Sweden, who was flying to New York for the signing of an accord on Namibian independence, aides to Mr. Carlsson said. Others included executives of Volksagen and The Associated Press. There were also unconfirmed reports that six members of the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service were aboard.\nPan Am officials in New York said it was the worst single-plane disaster in the airline's history.\nDisappears From Radar Screens\nThe plane left Heathrow about 25 minutes behind schedule at 6:25 P.M. (1:25 P.M., New York time). It disappeared from air controllers' radar scopes 52 minutes later, shortly before a series of explosions and fires were reported on the ground in the Scottish village of Lockerbie, according to witnesses and official accounts. [The Associated Press quoted authorities as initially saying that the plane may have hit a hillside in the hamlet of Corrie, six miles from Lockerbie, and that debris was strewn across the countryside.] ''The aircraft is reported to have hit two rows of houses, which have been demolished by the impact, and also to have hit vehicles on the highway,'' said a spokesman for the Royal Air Force's rescue and coordination center near Edinburgh. Houses and cars along the highway to Glasgow were still blazing fiercely several hours after the crash, he said. There were no survivors in these houses, about 40 in all, The Associated Press reported.\nThe Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said that 9 or 10 bodies had been recovered about two miles from the crash site.\n''A rescue situation does not exist anymore,'' the rescue and coordination center said. ''We are just recovering bodies.''\nBBC television late tonight broadcast pictures of raging fires, devastated houses and cars and shreds of aircraft wreckage. Witnesses said the huge aircraft had left a deep crater where it came down, near a gasoline station.\nA retired policeman, Bob Glaster, who lives near the site of the crash, said: ''The plane came down 400 yards from my house. There was a ball of fire 300 feet into the air, and debris was falling from the sky. When the smoke cleared a little, I could see bodies lying on the road. At least one dozen houses were destroyed.''\nThe spokesman at the rescue and coordination center said that the first impact of the plane was in the southwestern corner of the village, which has a population of about 4,000, and that the aircraft had bounced after hitting the ground, spreading wreckage over six areas over 10 miles. ''We obviously fear many people were killed, but there are no reports of casualties yet,'' he said more than three hours after the crash.\nThe airplane had a capacity of 412 passengers. There were 243 passengers on board, and 15 crew members, Pan Am said. Jeff Kreindler, a Pan Am spokesman in New York, said the was ''no sign at all'' of adverse weather that might have been a factor.\nEmergency blood supplies were sent to the crash site from hospitals all over Scotland. The village hall was being used as a makeshift mortuary.\nMr. Kreindler, the Pan Am spokesman, said, ''There was no indication of any problems on board that aircraft or with the machine itself,'' Asked whether the plane's crew had received any bomb threats, he said, ''There were no threats.''\nNo Midair Collision, Either\nThe British Defense Ministry said there had been no midair collision with another plane, civilian or military, and Michael Vertigans, a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority, said there were no reports of emergency signals from the plane before it went down. An air-traffic controller at Prestwick Airport near Glasgow was reported to have spoken to the pilot of the plane a few minutes before the crash, and he reportedly gave no sign he was in difficulty.\nThe crash was the worst aviation accident in British history. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said tonight that she was ''shocked by this terrible disaster'' and expressed her sympathy to the United States Ambassador, Charles H. Price 2d. She sent her Secretary of State for Scotland, Malcolm Rifkind, to the scene this evening, and Britain's Transport Secretary, Paul Channon, said he would make a report on the findings Thursday morning.\nMr. Price and Mr. Rifkind flew to the scene tonight. Earlier, the United States Embassy in London said it was not known how many of the passengers were Americans.\nPan American's planes from Germany and Britain are often used by United States Government employees and military servicemen stationed in Europe and their families.\nThe rescue-center spokesman said the fire on the ground had hampered rescue attempts by teams of police and Royal Air Force doctors who flew by helicopter from military bases near the crash area. The A74 highway between Glasgow, about 70 miles northwest of the site, and the Scottish border with England, 20 miles to the south, was cut, and telephone lines to the area were also brought down by the crash.\nWitness' Account\nMike Carnahan, who lives two miles south of Lockerbie, said: ''I was driving past the filling station when the aircraft crashed. The whole sky lit up and the sky was actually raining fire. It was just like liquid.''\nMr. Carnahan said he thought the aircraft had been trailing flames before it hit the ground, but there was no confirmation of this from authorities.\nThe plane that went down tonight was delivered to Pan American in February, 1970, according to Craig Martin, a spokesman for the Boeing Company, the manufacturer. He estimated that it had 72,000 hours in service and had made 16,500 landings.\nAviation authorities thought that since the jet disappeared from ground controllers' radar screens when it was at 31,000 feet, without an emergency call from the cockpit, whatever brought it down must have happened instantaneously.\nWhat Happened to Transponder?\nIf the power to the electrical system operating the plane's transponder had not been suddenly cut, the transponder would have kept sending signals about the aircraft's position and altitude to radar screens on the ground, which would have shown it losing altitude as it fell.\nAmong the kinds of things that might have suddenly cut power would be a bomb, an explosive decompression caused by a structural weakness, or a decompression caused by a midair collision.\nMr. Kriendler said there was no indication of an explosion and that Pan Am had not received any threats.\nHe said that 30-mile-an-hour winds were reported at about 4,000 feet when the aircraft took off, but there was no information of how strong the winds were at 31,000 feet, the plane's cruising altitude before it apparently lost power.\nThe 747 was a relatively old plane, the 15th such aircraft built, and had been involved in one previous accident, according to National Transportation Safety Board records. That was in 1970, when it encountered severe turbulence near Nantucket on a flight from New York to Paris. Seven people were seriously injured.\nHowever, Mr. Kreindler, the Pan Am spokesman, said at a news conference tonight there was no indication that the age of the plane had anything to do with the crash. He said that in 1987, it was renovated under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program of the United States Air Force.\nUnder that program, he said, commercial aircraft are specially outfitted to expand the airlift capabilities of the Air Force, including adding a large cargo door and reinforcing the floor.\nPan Am officials have said that the changes put no extra strain on the aircraft. In addition, Mr. Kreindler said, the plane underwent cyclical maintenance in San Francisco on Dec. 14 after 250 flight hours.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nA Pan Am 747 Jumbo Jet bound for John F.

On Dec. 21, 1988, a New York–bound Pan Am Boeing 747 exploded in flight as a result of a terrorist bomb and crashed in and around Lockerbie. The crash killed all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. In Nov., 1991, the U.S. Dept. of Justice indicted two Libyan intelligence agents for the bombing; Libya was also implicated in the similar 1989 bombing of a French UTA DC-10 over Niger in which 170 people died. After the imposition (1992) of economic sanctions by the United Nations and long negotiations, Libya turned the suspects over in 1999, and they were sent to the Netherlands for trial (under Scottish law). After a nine-month trial, one of the two defendants was found guilty (2001) and sentenced to life imprisonment; the other was acquitted. In 2003, after Libya acknowledged involvement in the Lockerbie bombing and agreed to settlements with the families of the victims of the two bombings, the UN Security Council lifted its sanctions. A Scottish judicial review board, however, ruled in 2007 that the convicted defendant, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, had legitimate grounds for a new appeal based on new evidence and questionable testimony at the trial. Megrahi, terminally ill with cancer, began a new appeal in 2009 but subsequently withdrew it and was released on compassionate grounds; he died in 2012.\nBibliography\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nLockerbie is the first large town north of the Scottish Border on the ... At 7.03pm a bomb on board a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet, ... Lockerbie Air Disaster ... Lockerbie Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland Lockerbie Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland\nKing's Arms Hotel\n \nLockerbie is the first large town north of the Scottish Border on     the main road and rail routes from Carlisle to Glasgow. It has been bypassed by     the main A74 since 1973 and the M74 since 1995, but the railway station close     to the centre of the town on the main West Coast Main Line remains active.\nIt seems likely that Lockerbie has existed since at least the days     of Viking influence in this part of Scotland in the period around AD900. The     name means Loki's Village in Old Norse. The presence of the remains of a     Roman camp a mile to the west of the town suggests its origins may be even     earlier. Lockerbie first entered recorded history, as Lokardebi, in     1306.\nLockerbie's main period of growth started in 1730 when the     landowners, the Johnstone family, made plots of land available along the line     of the High Street, producing in effect a semi-planned settlement. By 1750     Lockerbie had become a significant town, and from the 1780s it was a staging     post on the carriage route from Glasgow to London.\nPerhaps the most important period of growth was during the 1800s.     The century started well, with the construction of Thomas Telford's Carlisle to Glasgow road     through Lockerbie from 1816. And it got better when the Caledonian Railway     opened the line from Carlisle to Beattock through Lockerbie in 1847 and later all the way to Glasgow. From 1863 until 1953     Lockerbie was also a railway junction, serving a short branch line to Lochmaben.\nLockerbie had been home to Scotland's largest lamb market since the     1700s but the arrival of the Caledonian Railway increased further its role in     the cross-border trade in sheep. The railway also produced a lowering in the     price of coal, allowing a gas works to be built in the town in 1855.\nMuch of Lockerbie is built from a red stone that can seem gloomy on     a dull day or remarkably bright in the sun. As a result the weather can dramatically     change the appearance and feel of the town. There are a number of particularly     imposing buildings near the centre, none more so than the Town Hall, finished     in 1880, complete with its impressive clock tower.\nA little to the north of the centre is the Dryfesdale Parish Church, whose red     stone exterior is outdone by its brightly decorated interior. The name     Dryfesdale comes from the local river, the Dryfe Water, which joins the River     Annan a little to the west of the town. Less well known and a mile and a half     south of Lockerbie is the fascinating Ukrainian Chapel at the old Hallmuir     Prisoner of War Camp.\nThe name of Lockerbie is, of course, known worldwide because of the     tragedy that took place here on Wednesday 21 December 1988. At 7.03pm a bomb on     board a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet, Pan American Flight 103 en route from London to     New York, exploded over Lockerbie, bringing the aircraft down on and around the     town. 243 passengers, 16 crew and 11 residents of Lockerbie were killed. The     270 victims ranged in age from 2 months to 82 years and came from 21 nations.\nThe disaster is remembered in a number of way. Stained glass     windows in the Town Hall display the flags of the countries whose nationals     were killed. There is also a Book of Remembrance held in the Memorial Room at     Tundergarth; and at Dryfesdale Cemetery, a little to the west of Lockerbie,     there is the Garden of Remembrance     and Lockerbie Air Disaster Memorial.\nLockerbie from the       East\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\n...

I believe that’s not true if the shot of adrenalin is powerful enough.\nI received such a jolt on Wednesday December 21, 1988, and have been reliving those memories in recent months during the making of a documentary, The Lockerbie Bombing .\nIt was a cold, crisp evening that December, and Kirsty Wark – my then girlfriend and now wife – and I had just arrived back in the office after a very convivial Christmas lunch with our colleagues on BBC Scotland’s political programme Left, Right and Centre. I worked on it as a political researcher, while Kirsty presented it on Friday nights.\nWe had arrived back at the office just after 7pm and were collecting our stuff to head off for our first Christmas together when word came through of an explosion in the Scottish Borders .\nThe then BBC Scotland controller, John McCormick, bundled us into his car and told his driver to get us to Lockerbie as quickly as possible. We were asked to get ready to cover the story for the following morning’s Breakfast Time programme. We arrived around 9pm, after persuading the police to let us through the cordon.\nRelated Articles\nLockerbie bombing: looking back at the man convicted\n20 May 2012\nThe sight that greeted us was quite extraordinary. The skies lit up over Lockerbie had not prepared us for the fires still burning in the streets. Plane debris was strewn everywhere, steel mangled into in remarkable shapes.\nBut oddly, my memories are dominated by two other senses. The first was smell. The overpowering, sickly, almost sweet smell of aviation fuel hung everywhere. The second was the remarkable sense of stillness. Some fires still crackled but there were no sirens, and no screaming.\nWe both worked through the night, arranging for members of the emergency services and public to appear live on television the next morning. People were deeply shocked, of course, but there was a quiet steadiness about how they went about their work.\nMy documentary about the 25th anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing contains plenty of deeply sad archive material – not least the news footage that shows the NHS workers who had rushed to the hospital to volunteer their services, and the dawning and terrible realisation that there were no survivors to treat.\nThough it will be hard for a younger generation to believe, we did not have mobile phones in 1988. Today, we can upload and share pictures on Facebook and Instagram in seconds. In Lockerbie, the public phonebox nearest the main crash site and those at hotel receptions had queues not of people longing to inform loved ones they were safe, but of journalists chronicling the disaster to their newsrooms.\nThe morning after the disaster, we went live at 6am. But it was only as the dawn rose during the programme that the full devastation wrought by Pan Am flight 103 falling from the skies was revealed. With the sun up, the most poignant images for me were the personal belongings of the doomed passengers: ruptured suitcases with wrapped Christmas presents, Bibles beside the bodies of believers. After 48 hours on duty, we headed home for a very sombre Christmas.\nMy abiding thought on Lockerbie, reinforced by making this documentary, is the importance of cherishing life. News cameras in the United States, where Flight 103 had been heading, caught Nicole Boulanger, whose young daughter was on the plane, collapsing in grief at news of its fate and writhing uncontrollably on the terminal floor of JFK airport, calling out for “my baby”. Her recollection of setting an empty place at the Christmas table four days later is heart-rendingly sad.\nI only truly appreciate her loss now I have children of my own. The death of a child is surely a life sentence without parole.\nAmid all the conspiracy theories and relentless speculation that followed the Lockerbie bombing, the stories of the people at the heart of the tragedy have tended to get lost.

Lockerbie | Article about Lockerbie by The Free Dictionary Lockerbie | Article about Lockerbie by The Free Dictionary\nLockerbie | Article about Lockerbie by The Free Dictionary\nhttp://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Lockerbie\nAlso found in: Dictionary , Wikipedia .\nLockerbie\n(lŏk`ərbē), village (1991 pop. 3,892), Scotland, site of a 1988 airplane crash. On Dec. 21, 1988, a New York–bound Pan Am Boeing 747 exploded in flight as a result of a terrorist bomb and crashed in and around Lockerbie. The crash killed all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. In Nov., 1991, the U.S. Dept. of Justice indicted two Libyan intelligence agents for the bombing; Libya was also implicated in the similar 1989 bombing of a French UTA DC-10 over Niger in which 170 people died. After the imposition (1992) of economic sanctions by the United Nations and long negotiations, Libya turned the suspects over in 1999, and they were sent to the Netherlands for trial (under Scottish law). After a nine-month trial, one of the two defendants was found guilty (2001) and sentenced to life imprisonment; the other was acquitted. In 2003, after Libya acknowledged involvement in the Lockerbie bombing and agreed to settlements with the families of the victims of the two bombings, the UN Security Council lifted its sanctions. A Scottish judicial review board, however, ruled in 2007 that the convicted defendant, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, had legitimate grounds for a new appeal based on new evidence and questionable testimony at the trial. Megrahi, terminally ill with cancer, began a new appeal in 2009 but subsequently withdrew it and was released on compassionate grounds; he died in 2012.\nBibliography\n\n"
