Those familiar with the opera's history are aware that Verdi was forced by censors to move the opera's location out of Sweden, and he ultimately chose the artistically unsuitable but politically acceptable locale of Boston. The opera was originally entitled Gustavo III but, to satisfy censors once more, was changed to Una vendetta in domino. That was eventually changed to Un Ballo in maschera and most of the characters names were also changed. The story, of course, was inspired by the 1792 assassination of Swedish King Gustav III, who was shot at a masked ball. In the Verdi opera, he is stabbed to death there. Well, despite all the trouble from the censors Verdi produced a masterpiece, as is documented on this fine Blu-ray disc.\nThe cast is excellent and contains at least one newcomer who will undoubtedly have a major career on the operatic stage. Arkansas-born, Vienna-based Kristin Lewis makes both her debut as Amelia and her Parma debut in this production. She has a powerful and quite lovely voice: try her stunning Act II arias Ecco l'orrido campo and Ma dall'arido stelo divulsa. She may be a little stiff in dramatics, but she is obviously a great talent, perhaps one that will develop further. Francesco Meli turns in splendid work as Riccardo. Try his audience-pleasing Act III aria Ma se m'e forza perderti or his three Act II duets with Amelia (Teco io sto; Nono sai tu che se l'anima mia; and M'ami …Oh, quai soave brivido) to sample several fine moments from his stunning performance. Serena Gamberoni as Oscar is also impressive: hear her sprightly and utterly vivacious First Act aria Volta la terrea fronte. She is, by the way, the real-life wife of Meli. Vladimir Stoyanov as Renato is also outstanding and brought down the house with his sensational Third Act aria Eri tu che macchiavi. Elizabetta Fiorillo portrays a most effective Ulrica, appropriately coming across as a powerfully dark character. Her voice is imposing, though her vibrato too often turns into wobble. Ensemble numbers are uniformly excellent throughout the production: sample the colorful and spirited Ogni cura si doni al diletto, from Act I.\nConductor Gianluigi Gelmeto leads a vital, highly detailed performance, with well judged tempos and a masterly sense for phrasing: every note coming from the pit seems a perfect fit for the action and emotions on stage. Needless to say, the orchestra responds with total comittment and accuracy.\nNot only is this a great musical success, but the production is also excellent. Stage Director Massimo Gasparon, basing his effort on an older one by Pierluigi Samaritani, has fashioned a brilliant staging that gives the opera a traditional treatment, replete with period costumes and sets that fit the historical aspects of the story. Those sets, as well as the lighting and other production aspects, are most effective: the huge stairway in the throne room of the King's palace in the opera's opening scene is quite imposing and visually arresting, as is the scene at the sinister Ulrica's hut later on in the Act, where you see scantily clad bodies writhing on the stage floor and beams of moonlight shooting across the stage, all to create a striking and deliciously eerie setting. The opening scene of Act II, at the gallows – which is really a cemetery here – features tilted crosses marking graves, barren blackish trees and fog rising from the stage floor. Okay, that last touch might well be a cliché, but on the whole the scene is splendidly macabre and haunting! As for the masked ball, it takes place in a palatial ballroom which, with its cathedral-like pillars, regal architecture and predominance of blue colors and dark periphery, seems like an imaginative combination of the angelic and demonic.\nThe camera work and sound reproduction are first rate. All in all, this is an outstanding offering on virtually every count. If later on I were to compile a list of the top five opera videos of the year, this would almost certainly end up on it.

On the Road in Drottningholm, Sweden: The Rococo Machine — opera in an 18th-century venue\nOn the Road in Drottningholm, Sweden: The Rococo Machine — opera in an 18th-century venue\nJune 30, 2016\nDownload article as PDF\nby Nicholas Jones\nThe Palace Theatre at Drottningholm, a royal residence on a beautiful lake not far from Stockholm, is celebrating its 250th anniversary this summer. Replacing an earlier baroque theatre destroyed in a fire, the new theatre was used steadily during the second half of the 18th century by the opera-loving Swedish king, Gustav III.\nIn an operatic turn of fate, Gustav was assassinated in 1792 during a masquerade at Stockholm’s Royal Opera House — a story revisited in Verdi’s opera, Un ballo in maschera.\nAfter Gustav’s death, operas ceased at Drottningholm. The theatre was abandoned and turned into a place to store old furniture. In the early 20th century, theatre historians discovered that most of the original stage equipment — flats, drops, candle-powered lights, thunder sheets, and other special effects of early opera — had been preserved intact, as in a time capsule. Now restored, the theatre is once again used for operas, under the direction of the Drottningholm Theatre Museum. It is one of a handful of surviving European opera houses from the 18th century.\nMany opera fans know the Drottningholm Palace Theatre as the nominal venue of Ingmar Bergman’s charming film version of Mozart’s Magic Flute (1975), which ventures backstage to show Papageno (the very young Håkan Hagegård) dozing amidst the stage machinery and nearly missing his cue for the bird-catcher aria. In fact, the actual theatre was too fragile for movie-making, so Bergman filmed his movie in a replica on a soundstage in Stockholm.\nTravelling recently in northern Europe, I had the opportunity to see an opera in the Drottningholm Palace Theatre. The Rococo Machine had been commissioned from Swedish composer Jan Sandström for the 250th anniversary of the theatre’s construction. I thought that it might be a pastiche opera along the lines of the Metropolitan Opera’s 2011 Enchanted Island — assembled from tunes by Handel, Vivaldi, and Rameau — but I was delighted to find it a brand new work. Its own engagingly eclectic music has echoes of Handel and Mozart, as expected, but also draws on a number of 20th-century composers, such as Mahler, Strauss (both Richard and Johann), Britten, and even Morricone and Sondheim.\nThe premise for Tuvalisa Rangström’s libretto was the fire that destroyed the original baroque opera house. A young apprentice to the lighting-master (soprano Elisabeth Meyer) arrives at the newly-built replacement theatre, not quite knowing what she is supposed to be doing. One by one, she encounters the backstage personages whose skills at illusion and fantasy will eventually bring the theatre to life with a new opera: the melancholy librettist (mezzo-soprano Matilda Paulsson), the bossy stage manager (baritone Loa Falkman), the romantic set-painter (tenor Martin Vanberg), the flamboyant wig-maker (soprano Kerstin Avemo), and the ballet master (bass Johan Schinkler). Four versatile dancers also play a number of roles, reminding us that dance is a crucial element in rococo opera.\nI’m not sure I caught all the nuances of the plot (the opera was sung in Swedish, with English supertitles), but perhaps it’s enough to say that after various dream-like temptations, tests, and trials reminiscent of Mozart’s operas and Bergman’s movies, everything seems to come out fine in the end. The singers form a balanced vocal sextet, who happily come together in a Figaro-like finale.\nConducted by Daniel Stern, son of violinist Isaac Stern, the small orchestra performed on early instruments, including natural horn and trumpet, and period clarinet.\nThe singers, dancers, and orchestra were excellent, but the real star of the production was the theatre itself. Appropriately, the opera’s subtitle was “an anniversary opera about loving a theatre.”\nThe stage lighting played an important part. Muted in intensity and directed onto the stage from the wings, it lit the singers from the side. Totally absent was the bright front spotlighting that we have come to expect in the theatre. It wasn’t always easy to know what we were seeing, but that uncertainty was part of the experience.\nLike many audience members today, I often experience opera through brilliantly-lit close-ups — on DVD or in the Met’s HD Live presentations — in a glaring (if fascinating) scrutiny. There, it seems we know everything about the singer and the character. Here, the lighting emphasized what we can’t see, and perhaps shouldn’t.\nAs in the 18th century, the chandeliers in the theatre were left on during the performance (they would have originally been candles; here they were low-wattage electric bulbs). Thus, people in the audience were aware of each other and of the hall in which they were sitting — a consciousness that was totally appropriate in this opera about the mysteries and lure of theatricality itself.\nAs in Bergman’s film, there was a lively, Chinese-style dragon with dancers visible beneath its sinuous body, and a spectacular hot-air balloon was obviously being lifted into the flies by hand-pulled ropes. Scenes changed by means of painted flats pushed into view from the wings, and trap-doors opened and closed with no attempt at disguise. Thunder came from a bowling ball running down a wooden chute, and the storm from a cranked wind machine.\nThe theatre, in short, was an actor in the opera, as much as any of the singers or dancers.\nHaving gotten my ticket the night before, I sat in the back row, feeling a bit like a minor emissary to the Swedish court from some even more minor dukedom. Even so, I could hear everything. The acoustics, with no electronic enhancement, were superb. The singers were vocally present, and balanced perfectly with the orchestra.\nClick here to watch a video tour of the Theatre and its machinery.\nPart of the theatre’s excellent sound might be due to the shape of the hall — an extended rectangle. Part might also be due to the wooden floors and walls: it felt a bit like being inside a Stradivarius. But much might owe itself to the small scale of the whole enterprise: holding, I’d guess, about 500 people, the theatre maintains a strong connection between listener and stage, allowing everyone to feel an intimate involvement, acoustically and visually.\nWriting this after coming home, I’ve gone back to watch part of Bergman’s The Magic Flute. As the orchestra plays the overture, the film shows members of the audience listening with silent, deep attentiveness (including Bergman’s own granddaughter). As in that film, watching this live production in the Drottningholm Palace Theatre was a way to appreciate even more deeply the importance of theatricality. And to remember that opera’s wonder and delight are not made by hiding the machinery, but rather by letting the machinery be present, and by daring to give it a life of its own.\nPublished on ClevelandClassical.com June 29, 2016.\nClick here for a printable copy of this article\n\n"
