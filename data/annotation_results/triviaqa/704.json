Evita Movie Review & Film Summary (1997) | Roger Ebert Evita Movie Review & Film Summary (1997) | Roger Ebert\nTweet\n“Evita” allows the audience to identify with a heroine who achieves greatness by--well, golly, by being who she is. It celebrates the life of a woman who begins as a quasi-prostitute, marries a powerful man, locks him out of her bedroom, and inspires the idolatry of the masses by spending enormous sums on herself. When she sings: “They need to adore me--to Christian Dior me,” she's right on the money.\nAdvertisement\nI begin on this note not to criticize the new musical “Evita” (which I enjoyed very much), but to bring a touch of reality to the character of Eva Peron, who, essentially, was famous because she was so very well-known. Her fame continued after her death, as her skillfully embalmed body went on to a long-running career of its own, displayed before multitudes, spirited to Europe, fought over, prayed over, and finally sealed beneath slabs of steel in an Argentine cemetery. Eva Peron lived only until 33, but she went out with a long curtain call.\nShe was not an obvious subject for a musical. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice , who wrote the stage version of “Evita” and whose songs are wall-to-wall in the movie, must have known that; why else did they provide a key character named Che Guevera (onstage) and Che (on screen), to ask embarrassing questions? “You let down your people, Evita,” he sings. She let down the poor, shirtless ones by providing a glamorous facade for a fascist dictatorship, by salting away charity funds, and by distracting from her husband's tacit protection of Nazi war criminals.\nWhy, then, were Webber and Rice so right in choosing Eva Peron as their heroine? My guess is that they perfectly anticipated “Evita's” core audience--affluent, middle-aged and female. The musical celebrates Eva Peron's narcissism, her furs and diamonds, her firm management of her man. Given such enticements, what audience is going to quibble about ideology? For years I have wondered, during “Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,” why we were not to cry. Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita got everything out of life she dreamed of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron should shed a tear or two; he is relegated in the movie to the status of a “walker,” a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory.\nAdvertisement\nAll of these thoughts, as I watched Alan Parker's “Evita,” did not in the least prevent me from having a good time. I suspect Parker has as many questions about his heroine as I do, and I am sure that Che (Antonio Banderas) and Juan Peron ( Jonathan Pryce ) do--not to mention Oliver Stone , co-author of the screenplay. Only Evita herself, magnificently embodied by Madonna, rises above the quibbles, as she should; if there is one thing a great Evita should lack, it is any trace of self-doubt. Here we have a celebration of a legendary woman (for those who take the film superficially) and a moral tale of a misspent life (for those who see more clearly).\nCertainly Parker is a good director for this material. He has made more musicals than his contemporaries, not only “ Bugsy Malone ,” “Fame” and “ The Commitments ,” but especially “Pink Floyd the Wall,” one of the great modern musicals, where he uses similar images of marching automatons. Working with exteriors in Argentina and Hungary and richly detailed interior sets, he stages Evita's life as a soap opera version of “ Triumph of the Will ,” with goose-stepping troops beating out the cadence of her rise to glory.\nThe movie is almost entirely music; the fugitive lines of spoken dialogue sound sheepish. Madonna, who took voice lessons to extend her range, easily masters the musical material. As importantly, she is convincing as Evita--from the painful early scene where, as an unacknowledged child, she tries to force entry into her father's funeral, to later scenes where the poor rural girl converts herself into a nightclub singer, radio star, desirable mistress, and political leader.\nAdvertisement\nThere is a certain opaque quality in Madonna's Evita; what you see is not exactly what you get. The Che character zeroes in on this, questioning her motives, doubting her ideals, pointing out contradictions and evasions. Yet for Evita there are no inconsistencies, because everything she does is at the service of her image. It is only if you believe she is at the service of the poor that you begin to wonder. Listen closely as she sings: “For I am ordinary, unimportant And undeserving Of such attention Unless we all are I think we all are So share my glory.” The poor, in other words, deserve what Evita has, so her program consists of her having it and the poor being happy for her. After all, if she didn't have it, she'd be poor, too. In other words: The lottery is wonderful, just as long as I win it.\nBanderas, as Che, sees through this; his performance is one of the triumphs of the movie. He sings well, he has a commanding screen presence, and he finds a middle ground between condemnation and giving the devil her due. He is “of the people” enough to feel their passion for Evita, and enough of a revolutionary to distrust his feelings.\nPryce, as the dictator, remains more difficult to read. He is grateful for the success Evita brings him (her broadcasts free him from prison, her campaigns win his elections, her fame legitimatizes his regime). But there is a quiet little scene where he knocks on her locked bedroom door and then shuffles back to his own room, and that scene speaks volumes for the haunted look in his eyes.\nAdvertisement\nThe music, like most of the Webber/Rice scores, is repetitive to the point of brainwashing. It's as if they come up with one good song and go directly into rehearsals. The reason their songs become hits is that you've heard them a dozen times by the end of the show. But Parker's visuals enliven the music, and Madonna and Banderas bring it passion. By the end of the film we feel like we've had our money's worth, and we're sure Evita has.\nPopular Blog Posts\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n\"The film is not a glorified Madonna video,\" says Parker. ... Madonna Tangos With Evita. ... Europe’s Populist Backlash Intensifies; Madonna Tangos With Evita - Newsweek Madonna Tangos With Evita\nMadonna Tangos With Evita\nThe pop diva says she was \"destined' to play Eva Peron. When you consider how it almost didn't happen, you wonder if she's got something there. Here's the whole strange saga.\nBY NANCY GRIFFIN\nTry Newsweek for only $1.25 per week\nIn the most keenly anticipated movie of the Christmas season, the maligned and adored Madonna Louise Ciccone stars as one of the most maligned and adored figures of the century. Bottle-blond and driven by ambition, Evita Peron rose from poverty in the pampas to win the hearts of the workers and transform the political culture in Argentina. Viewed as a saint by ordinary people and a slut by the ruling class, she elevated herself to an iconic celebrity that still has almost religious status in her homeland.\nThe movie \"Evita,\" built around the songs of the 1976 concept album by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, is a double-edged Cinderella tale that tracks her journey from illegitimate birth to the pinnacle of power as the most precious political asset of Juan Peron (Jonathan Pryce). The character of Che (Antonio Banderas) narrates with a Brechtian cynicism that deflates Evita's deft mythmaking.\n\"Eva Peron is actually Madonna, but in 1948 instead of 1996,\" says director Alan Parker. For the actress, the director and Hollywood, there is much riding on this $60 million epic. For Madonna, 38, it's the fulfillment of a dream, her best shot yet at the movie-stardom that has so far eluded her. Parker's hope is that he has pulled off the audacious \"sung through\" format, which includes virtually no spoken dialogue. And for Hollywood the future of filmed musicals, long an endangered species, hangs in the balance.\nParker maintains that once people have seen Madonna as Evita, \"no one will think anyone else could have done it.\" Yet for the film's tortured 16-year history, \"no one could agree on who should play her.\" In 1979, \"Saturday Night Fever\" impresario Robert Stigwood, who produced \"Evita\" on Broadway, began efforts to mount a film version. The first director he spoke to was Parker, the British filmmaker who was just then finishing \"Fame.\" Parker didn't want to make two musicals in a row and declined while he and Stigwood were playing tennis. Stigwood reacted by bashing Parker with his racquet. \"True story,\" swears Parker.\nIt was the first of many bruisings to come in the \"Evita\" saga. Directors Ken Russell, Herb Ross, Hector Babenco, Francis Ford Coppola, Franco Zeffirelli, Michael Cimino, Richard Attenborough, Glenn Gordon Caron and Oliver Stone all came and went from 1979 to '95. Meanwhile, the rights bounced from Paramount to the Weintraub Entertainment Group to Disney to Cinergi Pictures.\nIn the late '80s, Madonna requested an audience with Stigwood. She swept into his office wearing an elaborate gown and a '40s upswept hairdo to show that she understood the soul of the South American strongman's wife. Stigwood was dazzled. \"She was perfect\" to play Evita, he says. In 1987 Oliver Stone came aboard. He wrote a widely admired script--also sung through, with the lyrics essentially forming the screenplay--that he planned to film, bursting with tango dancing, on location in Argentina. He and Madonna spent a jolly evening with Andrew Lloyd Webber in the composer's lavish Trump Tower apartment in New York. \"He played \"Aspects of Love' for us on the piano after dinner,\" recalls Stone. Then, according to Stone, Madonna told Webber that she intended to rewrite some of the \"Evita\" score. \"At the time she hadn't done many movies, and she was insisting on script approval,\" says Stone. I said, \"Madonna, you can't have script approval.' And she wanted to rewrite Andrew Lloyd Webber! Here she was making these demands, and I said, \"Look, there's no point in our meeting anymore; it's not going to work'.\"\nStone nearly succeeded in getting \"Evita\" airborne with Meryl Streep in '89, but Streep backed out, claiming \"exhaustion.\" Stigwood made a new deal at Disney, where Madonna became attached to a version to be directed by Glenn Gordon Caron, the creator of \"Moonlighting.\" But when the budget soared to $30 million, studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg balked. Stone recommitted to the musical in '94 with Michelle Pfeiffer. This time he planned a big, glossy musical that would cost $60 million. Andy Vajna, head of Cinergi, came in with financing; Disney would distribute domestically.\nStone traveled to Argentina in '94 to scout locations and meet with Argentine President Carlos Menem to request the government's cooperation in filming. But Menem was under pressure from his own Peronist party not to allow these Hollywood interlopers to besmirch the memory of the sainted Evita--and he was facing an election. Menem ultimately denied Stone access.\nSo then Stone was gone, and Vajna summoned . . . Alan Parker, bringing the project full circle. He, too, envisioned a sung-through format, \"a new film genre--not opera, not an old MGM musical with people speaking, then bursting into song.\" But Parker refused to use Stone's script. \"I wanted to start from scratch,\" he says. \"It's a pride thing, really.\" Parker is livid that the Writers' Guild has decreed that he share the screenplay credit with Stone.\nMadonna wasted no time firing off a beseeching, four-page, handwritten letter to Parker that he describes as \"extraordinarily passionate and sincere.\" Only she could fully understand Eva Peron's pain, she said. Madonna then proceeded to summon all the forces of the universe to align themselves with her will, lighting candles, praying and consulting psychics.\nThat formidable will was prepared, at last, to relinquish control. The director of \"Mississippi Burning\" is a tough-minded auteur with a fearsome temper. He insisted that if Madonna was to be his Evita, she must understand who was in charge. \"The film is not a glorified Madonna video,\" says Parker. \"I controlled it and she didn't.\"\nAnd so, having found his Evita, Parker returned to Argentina to court President Menem in June 1995. Menem said that he would not stop Parker from filming in Argentina, but he could not possibly grant him the coveted Casa Rosada, where Peron and Eva lived, to use as a location. Menem and his advisers knew that no matter whom they finally allowed into Argentina to make \"Evita,\" the filmmakers would be met with the full force of citizens' feelings for Eva Peron. \"In Argentina there are two kinds of people,\" says Parker, \"those who think she's a saint and those who think she's a whore. There's no in-between.\"\nThe peculiar complexities of Argentine politics have allowed both right- and left-wing elements to claim Evita as their own. From the time Juan Peron was elected president in 1945 to Eva's death from cancer in 1952, the Perons advanced the cause of the labor unions and gave women the right to vote, but also--as keen admirers of Mussolini and Franco--cracked down on many freedoms with their tanks and goose-stepping soldiers. With her chignon, her couture wardrobe and her charitable foundations, Eva became the public face of Peron, a shining mother symbol for her country.\nA key component of the musical \"Evita,\" which has always rankled the Peronists, is its portrayal of her as a vulgar radio actress who slept with many men to advance her career. Her pre-Peron sexual escapades are well documented, and Parker was not about to whitewash his Evita--even as Madonna, no stranger to sexual scandal herself, wanted to portray Eva with more dimensions than a caricature of a woman who \"slept her way to the top.\"\nAs the \"Evita\" company began assembling in Buenos Aires last January, it seemed that they had made a dreadful mistake. \"Everybody wanted to kill us,\" says Parker. Driving in from the airport, he was greeted by graffiti on billboards and bridges saying FUERA [GO HOME] MADONNA. From the moment the star arrived, she was mobbed by fans and paparazzi, who made her a virtual prisoner in the Park Hyatt Hotel. The pro-Peronist press began a relentless campaign against the movie. A former secretary of Eva Peron's was publicly quoted as saying, \"We want Madonna dead or alive. If she does not leave I will kill her.\"\nOn the first day of filming, hostile crowds burned the English and American flags. Extra police protection was added. At a hastily arranged press conference attended by 370 journalists, a subdued Madonna promised to \"portray Evita as a courageous and respectable woman.\"\nThen the notoriously star-struck President Menem invited Madonna--the actress he had previously pronounced \"unsuitable\"--to his estate for a tEte-A-tEte. In her diaries published in Vanity Fair, she described how the president's eyes roamed over her body and kept settling at her bra strap. (\"Madonna always thinks everyone is looking at her bra strap,\" says Parker.) After playing her recording of \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" for Menem, she zeroed in for the kill: could she please sing the song on the Casa Rosada balcony, where Eva Peron addressed the throngs? He did not answer.\nAs filming progressed, the furor subsided: Argentina finally got bored with the movie. There were not even any star high jinks to report. The tabloids were hoping for an affair between Madonna and Banderas, but his pregnant wife-to-be, Melanie Griffith, was keeping close tabs on him. Meanwhile, Madonna enjoyed the occasional visit from her boyfriend, Carlos Leon.\nThe production was massive: during the 84-day shoot a total of 40,000 extras were dressed in period garb. Evita's funeral alone required a parade of 4,000 supplicants at the coffin. Madonna's wardrobe included a Fendi mink coat, Bulgari jewels and 30 pairs of custom-designed Ferragamo shoes. \"I had more suits than songs,\" says Jonathan Pryce. \"But not as many as Madonna.\"\nMadonna plunged into her work with a seriousness of purpose that won over the most skeptical observers. She had displayed that dedication while recording the soundtrack, orchestrated by Lloyd Webber, earlier in London. \"Madonna sings it better, far better, than Patti LuPone or Elaine Paige [the original stage Evitas],\" insists Parker. Even her old adversary Sir Andrew was impressed with the results as he personally played piano for her rehearsals of \"You Must Love Me,\" a ballad he and Tim Rice wrote for the movie.\nDuring filming, the actors lip-synced to playbacks of the prerecorded songs. Parker's plan was to create as realistic a visual style as possible within the artifice of the genre. \"Once you overcome the fact that people are singing, it's infinitely more convincing if it's shot in a naturalistic way.\" On the set, Madonna bitched and moaned like a true diva--about the heat, the flies, the waiting--but she was the most hardworking diva anyone ever saw. She would appear only fully dressed and made up as Evita. She did everything asked of her and never had a contretemps with Parker. \"She was a pain in the a--,\" he says fondly, \"but brilliantly prepared. Which is why you can't criticize her.\"\nEva Peron once railed against \"envious and mediocre people who never understood me and will never understand me.\" Madonna, too, says she is tired of people's misperceptions of her. In the ivory-tower jail of her hotel, her kinship with Evita grew as she watched newsreel footage of the Perons. \"I gave her the documentaries,\" says Parker, \"and what is really to her credit and not mine is how she captured every mannerism.\"\nJust days before they were scheduled to leave Buenos Aires, Menem granted \"Evita\" the Casa Rosada balcony. Madonna was overjoyed--\"I didn't come all the way to Buenos Aires to sing \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina' on a sound stage\"--but Parker's panicked first thought was \"Do I have enough light? I have 2,000 people in that shot.\" A replica of the palace was already under construction in London. But cinematographer Darius Khondji threw up spotlights to simulate the gritty, dramatic lighting he had seen in the black-and-white newsreels. For two nights running, a spectral, Hollywood Evita stood where Eva Peron had stood, and the filmmakers could see, in the emotion on the faces of the extras who tipped their faces upward, the living spirit of Evita--and why they had come to Argentina.\nNext stop, Hungary, then they'd be burning down the homestretch at London's Shepperton Studios. Just before she was to arrive in Budapest, Madonna called Parker from New York with startling news. \"I'm pregnant,\" she announced. Parker frantically began rearranging the schedule to move up scenes where Madonna danced, or where there was a danger that her pregnancy would show. He eliminated a shot where the ill Evita is carried down some church steps by her brother, fearing the actor might slip.\nCostume designer Penny Rose began sewing fabric inserts into the back of the star's costumes. A waltz sequence between Evita and Che, to be pieced together with footage from three separate locations, was a bit of a worry: Madonna had already been shot wearing a clinging bias-cut gown in Buenos Aires, so she would have to wear the same dress in Budapest and London. The waltz scene documents for the ages three different stages of Madonna's swelling figure, visible to the discerning eye.\nSo share my glory\nSo share my coffin . . .\nEvita's early death secured her niche in history as a martyr, and emotions ran high on the set when the final scenes between Eva and Juan were filmed. \"Singing can get to your emotions quicker than saying lines,\" says Pryce. In a hospital room, Juan tells Eva that she's dying with the song \"Your Little Body's Slowly Breaking Down.\" When filming began, the two actors were soon in tears. \"Both of us ended up in a bit of a state,\" says Pryce, \"which really worked for the scene.\" Parker decided to record the song live rather than use the prerecording because \"what we were doing with our emotions didn't match what was coming out of our mouths,\" says Pryce.\nEvita's deathbed \"Lament\"--the last song in the film, also recorded live--was the moment when Madonna surpassed her director's expectations. Her raw emotion destroyed even the most macho crew members present. More than anything, this \"Evita\" is a bold creative collusion between Madonna and Alan Parker. They both know that its fate now depends on whether the pathos that bathed the room that day will be reflected on the screen. \"We could both of us, her and me, fall flat on our faces,\" says Parker, \"or we could have done something really special. The audience will tell us.\"\nDAVID ANSEN\nALAN PARKER'S LAVISH production of Evita begins stunningly, in a Buenos Aires movie house, where a black-and-white melodrama is interrupted by the announcement of the death of Eva Peron. The moviegoers break into sobs. Leaping through time, Parker takes us to the little child Eva, an illegitimate country girl barred from her father's funeral by his middle-class wife--a trauma that plants the seeds of her ferocious class resentment. Now we're at her state funeral. Thousands of mourners throng the streets while the film's cynical Everyman narrator (Antonio Banderas) undercuts the pomp and circumstance: \"As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears/We're all gonna see she did nothing for years.\"\nIt's a riveting windup that raises hopes that Parker may pull off the daunting task of turning Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's virtually dialogueless musical into a ravishing screen opera. The Penny Rose costumes are to die for. Darius Khondji's burnished images are suitable for framing. Brian Morris's production designs superbly evoke the Argentina of the '30s and '40s and early '50s, during which time the ruthlessly ambitious Evita (Madonna) rises from small-time actress to the heights of political power on the arm of Juan Peron (Jonathan Pryce). It's gorgeous. It's epic. It's spectacular. But two hours later, it also proves to be emotionally impenetrable.\nWhat all of Parker's dazzling technique can't overcome is the problem that was built into the show onstage: It never had a coherent point of view about its heroine, and it still doesn't. If she was as cynical an opportunist as the narrator keeps telling us, why is the music urging us to weep for her as a tragic figure? Parker may think he's giving us a \"balanced\" view of Eva Peron--who is still as revered by her partisans in Argentina as she is reviled by her enemies--but having it both ways isn't balance; it's confusion. He's tinkered with the material, but what was really needed was a major overhaul.\nIt's not Madonna's fault that \"Evita\" feels remote. She gives a fierce, committed performance that captures Evita's steely will, if not the charisma that entranced a nation. Strong as she is, she's still more a performer than an actress. You get a sense of what's missing when she's alongside the effortless Pryce, who takes an underwritten part and gets it to breathe. You sense his power even in repose. Madonna and Banderas are better singers, but since they rarely have anyone to play off of except the audience, they sometimes seem to be selling their parts. The actors aren't helped by the prerecorded songs; there's a subtle dissociation between the images and the sound that keeps the drama encased in an aural bubble.\nWhat a tantalizing, frustrating movie this is: you yearn to be drawn inside its seductive surface, and never get there. Instead of deepening with Evita's amazing metamorphosis, the movie remains opaque. Instead of insight, you get spectacle. At the end, I knew I was supposed to be moved, but I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to be moved by. Maybe all the people who loved the show will love the movie, too--it's certainly impressive. But I still haven't a clue what it thinks it's saying.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\n... as part of her \"Rainbow Tour\" of Europe, she received so much press ... \"You Must Love Me,\" written especially for the film,Evita by Andrew Lloyd Webber and ... Madonna and the Making of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Evita Madonna and the Making of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Evita\nWhat's your next favorite movie?\nJoin our movie community to find out\nImage from: Life of Pi (2012)\nMadonna and the Making of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Evita\nPosted June 19, 2012 02:00 PM by Robert Siegel\nBeing a big fan of musicals, when I originally went to see the film Evita , I didn't know what to expect. I had not been familiar with the score, it was one of those original cast compact discs that I had never purchased (surprising I missed this one, since I have almost 400 original cast albums). I spent the entire time in the theater in awe of the work that was done on this film and also the score. This was a film that was well-planned and shot and edited beautifully. I became an even bigger fan of Alan Parker, and also gained more respect for Madonna and Antonio Banderes. How sad that Webber and Rice would never write another musical together, because personally I think that Joseph, Superstar and Evita are among Webber's best works.\nSince then I have had the chance to listen to original cast albums from the U.K. and the U.S.. What an improvement the musical geniuses behind this film made. The orchestrations are so full and perfected, and the fact that shooting was done on location where these events took place only adds to the excitement. I have owned the original Criterion special edition laserdisc and another laserdisc release which had DTS audio, and even for that period, the recording of this score is amazing. But with an new master (confirmed by Disney), this disc should absolutely rock! But you don't need to be a big fan of musicals to appreciate Evita . Though most of it is sung, the story alone and the performances are excellent. So, here is a look at not only behind the scenes of the film, but also some history of the story and of the famous Eva Duarte Peron and her rise to popularity.\nEva Durate Peron History\nEva Peron was born Maria Eva Ibarguren, the youngest illegitimate daughter of Juan Duarte, a middle-class estancia manager, and a domestic servant, Juana Ibarguren, on May 7, 1919, in Los Toldos, in the vast Pampas two hundred miles west of Buenos Aires. Seven years later, Juan Duarte died in a car accident and his Ibarguren family was prevented from attending the funeral by Duarte's legal wife, Dona Estela Grisolia. (The painful rejection that young Eva and her mother suffered here stayed with her all of her life. She would often refer to it, and the event formed the basis of her often fanatical hatred of Argentina's middle and upper classes.) Dona Juana later moved her family to the nearby town of Junin, where she opened a boarding house. It was here, at the age of fifteen, that Eva met Agustin Magaldi, the dubiously talented tango singer whom she persuaded to take her back to Buenos Aires. She bounced from lover to lover in an indisputably male-dominated society, prior to her minor celebrity as a film and radio actress.\nEarly modeling photo of Eva Duarte\nEva first met Colonel Juan Peron on January 22, 1944, at a charity concert organized to aid victims of the San Juan earthquake. Soon openly living with Peron as his mistress, she attracted the displeasure of both the oligarchyï¿½the ruling classï¿½and Peron's military cohorts. Disturbed by his growing public popularity, the ruling junta subsequently arrested Peron and incarcerated him at Martin Garcia Island prison. The populist insurrection that followed on October 17, 1945, led to his release and free elections the following year, which Peron won comfortably, becoming the 29th president of Argentina.\nOriginal dresses worn by Eva Peron on display in Argentina.\nEva threw herself into life as Argentina's first lady with a media blitz common now but unheard of then. She visited Spain, Italy and. France as part of her \"Rainbow Tour\" of Europe, and her movie-star style and populist charisma propelled her to worldwide celebrity. The global media exposure established her as one of the most famous women in the world and, certainly, the most famous woman ever to come out of South America.\nPhotos of Eva Duarte Peron\nReturning to Argentina from Europe, Eva created her own charitable organization, La Fundacion Ayuda Social Maria Eva Duarte de Peron, and proceeded to work sixteen-hour days righting the wrongs, as she saw them, in Argentina's unequal society. She oversaw the opening of twelve new hospitals and a thousand new schools (all named after her), clinics, medical centers, homes for the aged, homes for single girls, convalescent centers and shelters for the homeless. She even built an entire miniature children's city, La Ciudad Infantil, many years before Walt Disney came up with the idea. She gave away 200,000 cooking pots to the poor, 400,000 pairs of shoes, 500,000 sewing machines and so much more.\nGeneral Peron and his wife Eva, who at this time was becoming ill.\nIn a stroke of bravado, she even sent medical supplies and clothing to help the poor of the United States. Her generosity and demagoguery knew no end, except for the final bill. The country was slowly becoming bankrupt. Whether due to Eva's extravagant beneficence or her husband's shaky, autocratic economic policies, or because the Perons were just plain stealing, the truth is lost in Borges' cigar smoke and the contradictions of many historians. When asked by an American journalist why she didn't keep books for her charitable efforts, Eva replied, \"Keeping books on charity is capitalist nonsense. I just use money for the poor. I can't stop to count it.\"\nOil painting that hangs in the Casa Rosada\nThe Casa Rosada, where permission was finally granted to film.\nEva's celebrity and political clout were consolidated in the creation of the Peronist Women's Party (Eva campaigned for women's right to vote and it had become law in 1947). As her popular support grew, so did the dissident voices. Her ruthlessness and despotic fanaticism toward achieving her goals made her many enemies, not least of all within Peron's military. The nervous generals at the Campo de Mayo garrison saw her aspirations to the vice-presidency as nothing short of heresy. Eva was put forward as the vice-presidential candidate by the five-million-strong General Confederation of Labor (CGT), which organized the mammoth rally of August 22, 1951, that filled the Avenida p de Julio with a million supporters. The CGT had erected a giant, five-story-high scaffolding edifice to house the speaking platform. A massive arch framed the podium, declaring \"Peron-Eva Peron, La Formula de la Fatria,\" and the huge crowd clamored for her to accept the vice-presidential nomination.\nPhotographs of Eva Duarte Peron. In the lower photograph, Eva is accompanied by the Bishop of Madrid and Alcala, Bishop Eijo and Garay, entering the cathedral of San Francisco el Grande.\nBut their efforts were all for nothing. Nine days later, everything changed. Eva made an emotional, tearful radio broadcast renouncing all of her political ambitions. What caused this sudden reversal is not clear. Whether it was pressure on Peron from the military, or whether the medical diagnosis of her uterine cancer had finally been made clears to her, or perhaps some other factor. For eleven months, Argentina witnessed Eva's slow and public dying. In the elections of November, 1951, a special ballot box was brought to her bedside for her to cast her vote (and for her to be photographed for the Peronist media machine). For Peron's second term inaugural motorcade in June of 1952, emaciated and heavily sedated, she had to be propped up by a steel cage which was hidden from the crowds by her ample fur coat. At 8:25 PM on July 26, 1952, Eva died.\nThe grave sight of Eva.\nA dictatorship took power in Argentina. The new dictatorship took Evita's body from display and its whereabouts were not known for 16 years. From 1955 to 1971, the military dictatorship of Argentina issued a ban on Peronism. It was illegal to own pictures of Juan and Eva Perï¿½n even in one's home, but no one was allowed to speak their names. In 1971 the military revealed that the body was buried in a crypt in Milan, Italy, under the name \"Marï¿½a Maggi.\" In 1971, Evita's body was discovered and flown to Spain, where Juan Perï¿½n kept the corpse in his home. Juan and his third wife decided to keep the corpse in their dining room on a coffin near the table. In 1973, Juan Perï¿½n came out of exile and went back to Argentina, and became president for the third time. Perï¿½n died in office in 1974. It was Isabel (his third wife) who had Evita's body returned to Argentina and displayed beside Juan Peron's. The body was later buried in the Duarte family tomb in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires. Major measures were taken by the Argentine government to keep Evita's tomb secure. There is a trapdoor in the tomb's floor, and that leads to a compartment that contains two coffins. Under the first compartment is another trap-door and a second compartment. That is where Evita's coffin rests. This cemetery, which is located in the northern part of barrio Recoleta, holds the remains of  illustrious military generals, presidents, poets,scientists,  and other affluent Argentinians. Andrew Lloyd Webber, Composer\nAndrew Lloyd Webber is a native Londoner, born in South Kensington in 1948. His father was a composer, William Lloyd Webber, his mother was the pianist and educator Jean Johnstone Lloyd Webber, and his younger brother the world-renowned cellist Julian Lloyd Webber. He started composing at 6 years old and published his first piece at 9. He was a Queen's Scholar in history at Magdalen College, Oxford, but his studies soon were sidetracked by his passion: He was still in his teens when he met Tim Rice, then a 21-year-old law student, and the two invented rock opera and were transforming musical theater with Josephï¿½ and then with the international hit \"Jesus Christ Superstar.\" What followed, with the prolific Rice as well as with several other collaborators, was the stuff of musical history.\nTim Rice and (right) Andrew Lloyd Webber work on the Evita concept album.\nNo one, including Webber, could have predicted that his writing would move from the life of Jesus to the travails of P. G. Wodehouse's Jeeves, or that these would lead to the bite of Evita. No one ever seriously considered T. S. Eliot's Book of Practical Cats a possible subject for a popular musical-but it was a childhood favorite of Lloyd Webber and it, too, was transformed and made musical history. The monumental design of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" itself from the surprising source of a long-forgotten Gaston Leroux novel, did not prepare musical lovers for the intimate adult pleasures of Aspects of Love, a chamber opera that happens to work as a musical. I had a chance to see \"Aspects of Love\" on it's U.S. Tour and fell in love with the romantic musical with a tremendous score, and recorded beautifully with a full orchestra on a 2-CD set starring Michael Ball.\nWebber has composed  over 13 musicals, including \"Cats,\" The Phantom of the Opera , \"Evita\" and \"Jesus Christ Superstar,\" several of which have run for more than a decade both in London's West End and on Broadway. He also wrote the scores to other musicals including \"Starlight Express,\" \"Aspects of Love,\" \"Sunset Boulevard,\" \"By Jeeves\" and \"Whistle Down the Wind.\"  He has been given numerous honors, including a Knighthood (in 1992), seven Tony Awards, three Grammy Awards, an Academy Award, seven Olivier Awards and a Golden Globe ... His company, The Really Useful Group, is one of the largest theater operators in London ... His personal fortune was estimated at ï¿½797 million by the 2011 Sunday Times Rich List making him Britain's 52nd richest man. He divorced from singer Sarah Brightman and re-married in 1991 the former British international three-day-event rider, Madeleine Gurdon. They have three children, Alastair, William and Isabella.\nOriginal Broadway poster for Evita.\nWith help from his wife, Webber founded Watership Down Stud at his home in Hampshire in 1992 ... Purchased Kiltinan Castle Stud in County Tipperary, Ireland, in 1995 ... He enjoyed his first big race success in 2000 when Crystal Music won the Fillies' Mile at Ascot ... His wife also is very interested in steeple chasing and her silks were carried to victory by Bacchanal in the Stayers' Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2000. Simon Marsh is his racing manager.\nMost recently, not only did he write a sequel to his biggest hit, The Phantom of the Opera ,  titled Love Never Dies , but introduced a series of reality shows for the BBC to find stars for musical revivals on the west end (after he was knighted in 1992 and bought the Palace Theater in 1983 and now owns and has restored seven London theaters including the Palladium and the Theater Royal Drury Lane) very loosely based on the American Idol format, with host Graham Norton. Broadcast talent shows were produced for Oliver (titled \"I'd Do Anything),\" \"The Sound of Music\" (titled \"How do you Solve a Problem Like Maria\"), \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" (titled \"Any Dream Will Do\"), and \"The Wizard of Oz\" (titled \"Over the Rainbow.\") This allowed the public to make the final choice of who would be cast in the main part of the revival, as well as interest the national audience into seeing the musical live. It worked well. Seating for all four shows was sold out for many months and the BBC ratings for these shows topped the British television charts.\nJapanese poster\nTim Rice, Lyricist\nRice was born November 1944 in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. His father, Hugh Gordon Rice, served with the Eighth Army and attained the rank of major during World War II, while his mother, Joan Odette served in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) as a photographic interpreter. He was educated at Aldwickbury school, St Albans School and Lancing College and went on to study in France for a year at the Sorbonne. He joined EMI Records as a trainee in 1966 and when the producer left to set up his own organization in 1968, Rice joined him as an assistant producer. Along with his brother Jo and radio presenters Mike Read and Paul Gambaccini, he co-founded the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles and served as an editor from 1977 to 1996. He has also been a frequent guest panelist for many years on the radio panel games Just a Minute and Trivia Test Match. He released his autobiography Oh What a Circus: The Autobiography of Tim Rice in 1998, which covered his childhood and early adult life until the opening of the original London production of Evita in 1978. In September 1981, Rice, along with Colin Webb and Michael Parkinson, co-founded Pavilion Books with a publishing focus on music and the arts.\nTim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, photo taken in 2009.\nHe wrote the book and lyrics for five musicals that have played in the West End and around the world: \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolorï¿½ Dreamcoat,\" \"Jesus Christ Superstar,\" \"Evita\" (music by Andrew Lloyd Webber), \"Blondel\" (music by Stephen Oliver), and \"Chess\" (music by ABBA's Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Anderson). He then adapted the French-Canadian musical \"Starmania\" for English. He first joined forces with Alan Menken to write three songs for Disney's \"Aladdin,\" including the 1993 Academy Award-winner \"A Whole New World.\" He wrote the lyrics for all of the songs in the following Disney animated feature The Lion King , from which came his second Oscarï¿½- winning song, \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" (1995), with music by Elton John. He has completed work with Menken on a contemporary opera based on the life of King David, which was performed as a concert in Caesarea, Israel, in September 1996.\nPoster for the soundtrack album for music stores and promotion.\nRice wrote for three other stage musicals, \"Aida\" and \"The Lion King\" (adding new musical numbers), both for Broadway with Elton John and Disney, and \"Heathcliff,\" starring Cliff Richard, with music by John Farrar, which opened a national tour of the U.K. in October 1996. He was chairman of the U. K's Foundation for Sport and the Arts, an organization that distributed around 60 million pounds annually to sporting and artistic causes in the United Kingdom. He stepped into the late Howard Ashman's shoes once again in order to expand the Menken/Ashman Beauty and the Beast movie score for theatrical presentation. In 1994, he was knighted for his services to sport and the arts.\nEvita comes to the United States stage. Webber and Rice were at the premiere.\nRecently in 2012, Andrew Lloyd Webber announced a new reality series, \"Superstar\" which was to be like his former reality musical shows. Tim Rice wrote Sir Andrew a letter and asked him not to do the show, calling it \"downsizing\" their musical. Tim wrote, \"I've had several meetings with Andrew and said that I don't want this done but now it appears it's been signed and sealed. Andrew wants to rehash things all the time but I don't think Superstar needs that tasteless reality television treatment. Those shows are relentlessly downmarket which is fine if the show is a lightweight bit of fluff. They can't cast the show without my approval. I have the right to veto casting. So if Andrew casts it on TV and I didn't like the person, I could say so.\" About not working together after Evita, Tim Rice has stated he was the one that wanted to be on his own. \"When Phantom was at its peak,\" said Rice, \"and \"Chess\" was having problems, I thought probably it was a big mistake from my point of view. And people quite understandably were going to think our success is all down to Andrew. I suppose being vain and human I got a bit pissed off at that point. Not with Andrew particularly but with myself, that I should have stuck with him.\nPoster from the release in Argentina.\nFrom Concept Album to Stage to Film\nIn 1972, Robert Stigwood proposed that Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice develop a new musical version of \"Peter Pan,\" but they abandoned the project.  What intrigued Rice about Eva was a brief radio play he had heard while driving his car, but more importantly, the TV film Queen of Hearts by Argentine film director Carlos Pasini Hansen which had aired in the UK on 24 October 1972. The more Rice looked into the life of Eva Perï¿½n, including travel to Buenos Aires to research her life, the more fascinated he became by her; he even named his first daughter after her. The idea of writing a score with Latin flavours intrigued Lloyd Webber, but he ultimately rejected the idea. Lloyd Webber decided instead to collaborate with Alan Ayckbourn on \"Jeeves,\" a traditional Rodgers and Hart-style musical based on the P.G.Wodehouse character, which proved to be a critical and commercial failure. Lloyd Webber and conductor Anthony Bowles presented the musical at the Sydmonton Festival before making the recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Prior to its release, they played it for Harold Prince and asked him to become involved with the staging. Prince agreed, saying, famously, \"Any opera that begins with a funeral can't be all bad\", but he advised them that I can't take on any new commitments for the next two years. In Britain, Australia, South Africa, South America, and various parts of Europe, sales of the concept album exceeded those of \"Jesus Christ Superstar.\"\nThe Evita concept album was released in November 1976. The record went straight to the top of the British charts, an unprecedented occurrence for an un-produced musical, with the single release of \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\" sung by Julie Covington soaring to number one a month earlier. Jesus Christ Superstar, written earlier, was also a concept album but did not hit the charts as high as Evita did. When Alan Parker first heard the original concept album he immediately inquired as to the possibility of a film adaptation. \"'Evita' is an old passion of mine,\" Parker said. \"Eva Peron was fin extraordinarily complex, fascinating and charismatic woman and to tell the truth about her, in a balanced, contemporary cinematic way, entirely as an opera, is a great challenge to any filmmaker.\"\n(clockwise) Original concept album, Original London Cast, Original Broadway Cast, Movie Soundtrack\nParker subsequently dropped the idea of making the film, at the time, because Robert Stigwood, spurred on by the success of the record, decided to produce \"Evita\" for the London stage first, with Elaine Paige in the title role and Harold Prince directing. \"Evita,\" which opened at the Prince Edward Theater on June 21, 1978, was one of the greatest musical theater hits ever seen in London. By the time it closed, it had played 2,900 performances in the West End. It transferred to Broadway in 1979 starring Patti LuPone, and walked off with the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Musical and seven Tony Awards at the end of its first season. Robert Stigwood invited Alan Parker to the Broadway opening of \"Evita\" in 1979 and asked him if he would like to direct a film version. Parker, who was shooting \"Fame\" in New York, promised to give him his answer once he had finished that film. Eventually, Parker decided not to direct the film of Evita because he was loath to attempt another musical immediately after finishing \"Fame.\"\nFor fifteen years, Alan Parker often regretted his reply to Robert Stigwood as he read about the proposed stars and directors planning to make Evita including: Elaine Paige, Patti LuPone, Meryl Streep, Barbra Streisand, John Travolta, Raul Julia and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directors announced over the years were Ken Russell, Herb Ross, Alan Pakula, Hector Babenco, Francis Coppola, Franco Zeffirelli, Michael Cimino, Richard Attenborough, Glenn Gordon Caron and Oliver Stone. When Andy Vajna, whose company Cinergi was producing the film, offered him the project again at the end of 1994, he said he was glad that everything had come full circle.\nPoster from Denmark\nAs Parker began to work on the film's script in 1994, he was dogged by the same questions that Tim Rice faced when he originally researched into Eva Peron's life in 1976. At that time, there was little written about her and theatrical performances of \"Evita\" and the importation of the records were banned by Argentina's military dictatorship. Parker found that even as the film was made, in Argentina, Eva Peron is still thought of as either a saint or a sinner so his extensive research had to discover the real truth behind this woman whose image has been used as propaganda by both left-wing guerrillas and right-wing extremists. In writing the screenplay, Parker decided to overlook the stage play completely, as Harold Prince's stage directions were irrelevant for the cinematic version, and returned to the original concept album's score and lyrics but also his own research. Armed with all the available research material in existence from documentary footage made on Eva Peron, every possible book in English on the Perons and Argentina and old newspaper clippings, Parker was determined to write a film version of Evita as close to Eva Peron's own story as possible, and that story is the one he has told in his film.\nStory conception by Alan Parker for the film:\nMaria Eva Ibarguren (Eva Peron) was born on May 7, 1919, in Los Toldos, a tiny town two hundred miles west of Buenos Aires. Eva was the youngest, illegitimate daughter of Juan Duarte, a middle-class estancia manager, and a domestic servant, Juana Ibarguren. The family was very poor, and Eva was only 7 when her father was killed in a car crash. Very cruelly, the family was prevented from attending his funeral, and it is this memory which led to Eva's lifelong hatred of Argentina's middle-class. Later her mother opened a boarding house in Junin, a nearby town, and from where Eva escaped, at age 15, by cajoling Agustin Magaldi, a small-time tango singer, to take her with him to Buenos Aires. Her early years in 'the Big Apple' are vague as she climbed the social ladder in her desperate, search for acceptance, eventually becoming a film and radio actress and gaining some celebrity.\nMaterials used by Alan Parker to create a thoroughly detailed true story.\nAt a charity concert in aid of victims of the San Juan earthquake on January 22, 1944, Eva first met Goloneh Juan Peron and became his mistress, much to the chagrin of both the ruling class and Peron's military colleagues. Concerned about Peron's rising popularity with the labor unions, President Farrell had Peron arrested and imprisoned at Martin Garcia Island prison, unaware that such a move against a popular figure would lead to the insurrection of October 17, 1945. Peron was consequently released, and, in the free elections the following year, he became the 29th president of Argentina. Eva became very visible as the country's first lady and on her visit to Spain, Italy and France, as part of her \"Rainbow Tour\" of Europe, she received so much press attention that she easily became the most famous woman in the world. Upon her return to Argentina, and smarting from the West's image of her frivolous lifestyle and her husband's questionable politics, Eva immersed herself in \"good works.\" Eva founded her own charitable organization \"La Fundacion Ayuda Social Maria Eva Duarte de Peron\") and during her regular sixteen-hour working days she began to put right what she thought was wrong with Argentina's unequal society. Her building of new hospitals; clinics; medical centers; homes for the aged, for single girls and for the homeless; a thousand new schools all named after her; an entire miniature children's city (\"La Ciudad Infantil\") and the giving away of thousands of cooking pots, shoes, sewing machines, etc. to the poor, was driving the country into bankruptcy. When asked by an American journalist why she didn't keep books for her charitable efforts, Eva replied, \"Keeping books on charity is capitalist nonsense. I just use money for the poor. I can't stop to count it.\"\nThe birthplace of Eva Duarte has been debated. There could be two possible locations, shown here.\nAt the height of her power, Eva created the Peronist Women's Party and succeeded in campaigning for women to vote, which became law in 1947. Her ruthlessness to achieve her goals, however, brought her many enemies, particularly within Peron's military, who dissented against her becoming vice president when she was nominated by the five-million-strong General Confederation of Labor (CGT) at a giant rally on August 22, 1951. In spite of the people's efforts, nine days later in an emotional radio broadcast, Eva relinquished all her political aspirations. Her decision, whether because of pressure on Peron from the military, or whether her uterine cancer had been diagnosed, has never been fully explained. Eva Peron's public dying over the next eleven months was painful to witness. She cast her vote in the elections of November 1951, in a special ballot box brought to her bedside which was made into a photo opportunity for the Peronist media machine. For the inaugural motorcade celebrating Peron's second term in June 1952, heavily drugged and skeletal in appearance, Eva was kept upright by a steel cage hidden from view by her generous fur coat. At 8:25 p.m. on July 26, 1952, Eva Peron died at the age of 33 years old. Argentina went into a deep and frenzied mourning.\nSpanish poster\nProduction\nParker submitted his first draft of the script to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice in May, 1995 with 146 changes to the original score and lyrics. Finally after much negotiating by Parker, as it is well known that Lloyd Webber and Rice no longer work together out of choice, the three men met at Lloyd Webber's house in the South of France and successfully addressed all Parker's changes. One of the many alterations he had made was to rearrange the order of most of the last act, calling for new scoring from Lloyd Webber, and more importantly a new song to be written by the two of them. \"For obvious reasons, Andrew doesn't give his melodies away too hastily,\" Parker said. \"The possibility of these two gentlemen ever collaborating again was, I was told by many who knew them well, an idealistic but not overly practical, if not impossible notion.\" Parker wanted the film to retain a slightly soft image for the first two thirds and then get slightly sharper toward the last half hour to express the reality of what was happening to the country and to Eva.\nSetting up a shot for Evita.\nEver optimistic, Alan Parker left the new songs in the hands of Lloyd Webber and Rice, while he involved himself with the difficult task of casting his film. Michelle Pfeiffer had waited so long to star as Evita that by the time Alan Parker began working on the film she was already the mother of two small children, and the travel involved had now become impossible for her. Madonna, whom he had worked with developing a remake of \"The Blue Angel\" a few years earlier, wrote him a passionate and sincere handwritten, four-page letter while he was spending Christmas in England in 1994. She said she desperately wanted the part and that she would be prepared to give all her time and effort, over a very long period of time, to make the film. \"Madonna has never ever once gone back on her word,\" Parker says. \"She is extraordinarily accomplished and has given everything to make this film. I find it hard now to even conceive of anybody playing the part as well as she has done it.\"\nCinematographer Darius Khondji (left) discusses a shot with Alan Parker.\nAntonio Banderas was the favorite to play Che after Parker saw an audition tape he had made. When they met in a Miami restaurant to discuss the part, Banderas serenaded the director with a word-perfect rendition of all the songs from \"Evita,\" in full view of surprised diners. Jonathan Pryce was also Parker's choice for Peron. He had long admired the brilliant, classically-trained British actor, who had created the lead role of The Engineer in the stage musical \"Miss Saigon,\" for which Pryce won a Tony, and Parker had seen Pryce's bravura role as Lytton Strachey in the film \"Carrington,\" winning the Best Actor prize at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.\nOriginal storyboards used by Alan Parker.\nMadonna was adamant that she would sing the score as Andrew Lloyd Webber had written it, and early on she began working with top vocal coach Joan Lader in New York, and the film's musical supervisor, David Caddick, who is also Andrew Lloyd Webber's regular musical director. Within three months she had expanded her vocal range, using voice areas that she had never touched upon before. In September 1995, Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce and Jimmy Nail began rehearsals with Alan Parker in London. Even though all the dialogue was being sung rather than spoken, Parker wanted the dialogue to be as naturalistic as possible. He was convinced that the production of the film should be identical to how he made a normal dramatic film. The rehearsals went very successfully and by October 2, they were ready to begin recording the music in London. Over four months of working 7 day weeks, everyone involved put in over 400 recording hours preparing the 49 musical sections that were necessary for playback on set. It was a risky time for Alan Parker as he was constantly aware of the fact that decisions made in the recording studio would have to be adhered to on the film set.\nAs recording time moved on and Parker began to panic at the nonappearance of the new song, Lloyd Webber sat down at his piano one day and played the director the perfect melody. As with the original \"Evita\" score, the music always came first and then the lyrics, so now it was time to persuade Tim Rice to also come up with his customary magic. After many weeks, Rice came back with the beautiful song, \"You Must Love Me,\" that Madonna sings to clarify Eva's relationship with her husband. Parker had also asked Rice to completely rewrite the song \"The Lady's Got Potential,\" which Harold Prince had removed from the stage version, but which Parker had reclaimed, to explain the history of politics in Argentina pre-Peron.\n\"You Must Love Me\" written for the film by Webber and Rice won the Academy Award that year as best original song. As Webber accepted the award during a year when The English Patient was winning nearly every award, Webber first said, \"Thank God The English Patient didn't have a song.\"\nAs the recording proceeded, Parker also had to involve himself with preparing for shooting the film, which was already proving to be a logistical nightmare. He was always determined to shoot in Argentina and in June 1995 he had been granted an audience with President Carlos Menem. As soon as he received the word, he took the first plane to Buenos Aires, and surrounded by secret service agents met with the President at his private residence, Los Olivos. President Menem was sympathetic, but as a Peronist he wanted Eva Peron's memory to be respected - he had a huge portrait of Eva behind the desk in his office - and he was very wary of a film of Evita because of previous attempts to mount the production. Parker needed the President's help, and most importantly the use of the Casa Rosada, the official government house, which looms so large in the story.\n\"Every time I met one of his ministers over the next six months, the answer was the same no,\" Parker said. \"They wanted to see the script and I said that, from a creative point of view, I needed the freedom to express myself as I saw fit. I did always promise them it would be a balanced film, and I felt to shoot part of it in Argentina would add to the honesty of the film. I had visited Eva's birthplace of Los Toldos, the town of Junin where she grew up, and Chivilcoy where her father's funeral took place. My plan was to at least shoot Eva's early years there.\" After visiting seven other countries, Parker decided to start the filming in Buenos Aires, then move to Budapest to replicate Buenos Aires as it was in the thirties and forties. The crew was principally English, with American, French, Scottish and Irish technicians. Most of Parker's crew had worked with him before, but it was the first time he had worked with the cinematographer, Darius Khondji, a Frenchman of Persian descent. Parker has said, \"his continual brilliance (and shadows) and affable personality made the filming a constant delight, as he integrated perfectly with my usual camera crew.\"\nStoryboard production camera drawings\nThey were a juggernaut   \"the last of the traveling circuses\" was how David Lean described large film crews on the move-freighting 70 tons of equipment from England. By mid-January, 90 of the crew were lodged in Buenos Aires for filming to begin on February 8. Arriving at the airport was an indicator of what was to come throughout filming: a constant bombardment of journalists, photographers and TV cameras jostling them all at every turn. \"On that first drive in,\" Parker remembers, \"it was daunting to see the huge unwelcoming scrawled graffiti signs everywhere with Tuera (go home) Madonna,' Viva Evita,' and 'Chau Alan Parker and your English task force.'\" (\"Task Force\" was the epithet given to the British troops during the Falklands War). The weeks leading up to filming are always an awesome time for any director, but as Parker and his crew finalized their many locations and he worked through the camera script and cast the smaller parts, he came to realize, with nervous anticipation, what a monster of a film this truly was. It wasn't simply the obvious components - the thousands of people involved and the dozens of locations in two very different countries - but also the security concerns, not made any easier by the paparazzi who went to any lengths, including using helicopters, to get the pictures they needed.\nRare teaser poster\nMadonna, as the true professional that she is, arrived early in Buenos Aires to carry out her own research, meeting elderly Peronists and anti-Peronists alike, to fill in her own picture of Evita, and to complete final fittings on the over 80 costumes she would be wearing. It was upsetting for her to see the unwelcoming signs, and with fans and photographers stalking her every movement and keeping her awake at night, she had many difficulties with which to contend. Parker continued his pursuit of the Casa Rosada balcony for the important \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\" scenes with the powers that be, emphasizing that the production designer, Brian Morris, had photographed every square inch of the building and that if they could not film there they would build the facade at Shepperton Studios.\nMagazine cover created for use in the film.\nAs they forged ahead with the filming, with their 90 core crew and 150 Argentinean crew, they were attacked daily, in the newspapers, by unwelcoming journalists, who were completely unaware of exactly what they were doing. Their same stories were filed worldwide - the film that was not wanted there -- and they ran continuously the whole time the production was in Argentina. Eventually, the production became immune to all this negativity in their desire to make their film. There was no way that the production could keep the photographers away from the film being shot, because they were filming out in the open, recreating the world of 1936 when Eva was young, involving period vehicles, thousands of costumed extras, and entire streets dressed in the era. Not easy art direction in a busy city of ten million people. As the weeks went by, the opposition in all quarters ceased to trouble them as the public learned to get used to them being there.\nPoster from Poland\ncaption\nAs far as the Casa Rosada balcony was concerned, it was Madonna who succeeded where the rest had failed for over a year. Through her research acquaintances she managed an unofficial, personal meeting with Menem. The call to meet him came in one of Parker and her regular script meetings and as she dashed out of the door he suggested she take her CD of \"Don't Cry For Me\" with her. Madonna met with the President for an hour. The following week Jonathan Pryce, Antonio Banderas, Madonna and Alan Parker were summoned to an official meeting with President Menem at Los Olivos. They sat nibbling the President's famous pizza, exchanging small talk and generally tip-toeing around the important question. \"Let's cut to the chase here,\" Madonna suddenly said. \"Do we have the balcony or don't we?\" Menem smiled and nodded, \"You can have the balcony.\"\nOriginal costumes created for the film.\nA few days later, as Madonna came out on to that balcony to sing \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina,\" the 4,000 extras and the crew went wild. \"On the second night of shooting there, as we filmed the reverses on the crowd, I stood with Madonna on the balcony,\" Parker says. \"With all of the documentary footage imprinted in the back of our brains, it was impossible not to be moved when we were standing in the same spot where Eva stood looking down at a crowd of adoring thousands. Suddenly it wasn't just the illusion and replication of film. It was strangely real.\"\nAfter six weeks Parker's army moved on to Hungary with several tons of equipment, costumes and props in tow, and were shooting within four days of arriving in Budapest. The director tried not to panic when he received a phone call from Madonna in New York to say that she was pregnant. Calculating wildly, the two of them tried to keep it a secret from the crew upon her return to the shooting, but the cloak-and-dagger conversations he began to have in trying to reschedule without giving the game away, led to David Wimbury, the line producer, and Dennis Maguire, the first assistant, realizing that Parker had finally gone over the edge. Madonna eventually had to make her announcement.\nOriginal lobby cards\nIn Hungary, the biggest project was to prepare and film Eva Peron's state funeral. Parker and the crew had researched miles of documentary footage and wanted an exact replica of her cortege. The costume department, to be prepared for filming on the first shooting day, began fitting and dressing extras at 3:30 a.m. The call sheet read as follows: 4,000 crowd to include; 50 mounted police, plus horses; 200 soldiers; 50 army officers; 50 foot police; 60 sailors; 60 nurses; 300 working-class women; 100 upper-class women; 51 descamisados; 20 naval officers; 12 naval police; 300 working-class men; 15 palace guards; 8 pallbearers; 60 navy cadets; 60 army cadets; 300 middle-class women; 300 middle-class men; 100 Aristo men; 100 boys; 100 girls; 200Vnale background; 200 female background; 1,400 miscellaneous background; gun carriage; coffin; 4 army motorcycles; 2 police motorcycles; 6 Bren carriers; 2 half-track military vehicles; 2 fox tanks; 4 army trucks; CGT float, ete. etc. Miraculously, this giant procession was ready to film at 10:30 a.m., and the scene was shot for the next two days.\nAntonio Banderes publicity shot\nIn London everyone was back to normal and the final part of the shoot went without mishap. The film finished shooting at 2 a.m. on the morning of May 30, having filmed for 84 days, shooting in 3 different countries, involving over 600 film crew. They had shot 299 scenes and 3,000 slated shots on 320,000 feet of film with 2 cameras. Penny Rose's costume department, with a staff of 72 in three different countries, had fitted 40,000 extras in period dress. Over 5,500 costumes were used from 20 different costume houses in London, Rome, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Buenos Aires and Budapest, including over 1,000 military uniforms. Madonna's wardrobe alone consisted of 85 changes, 39 hats, 45 pairs of shoes and 56 pairs of earrings. Almost all of these were handmade in London. Martin Samuel, the chief hairstylist, created 42 different hair designs for Madonna. Brian Morris' art department created 320 different sets involving 24,000 different items of props. These statistics are only an indicator of the massive nature of this film. \"It's not easy making movies and it's certainly not glamorous,\" Alan Parker said on the set. \"The manic, tormented hard work, the long, upside-down hours and being constantly ankle-deep in pig shit is the reality. But sometimes it's really worth it.\"\nWhen the film was released, dozens of magazines featured Madonna on their covers.\nMadonna\nAn artist with a history of making history, Madonna, in a performance of a lifetime, had made the role of Evita completely her own. A renaissance woman in the truest sense of the term - singer, composer, producer, actor, executive, humanitarian and mother - there was nothing, it seemed, that Madonna could not do. It is her passionate commitment to excellence, her complete involvement in every essential aspect of her art, her career and her life, which has made Madonna one of a handful of the most innovative, influential and inspiring artists of our time and it is these same qualities that Madonna has brought to bear in the film and the music of Evita . Madonna's history towers over the chronicles of popular culture comprising a list of First, Best, Fastest and Longest that stands as a monument to one woman's exceptional ability and extraordinary ambition. From 1982, when a cocky, confident and coolly self-assured 24-year-old Detroit native first stepped onto the stage to lip-synch her debut single \"Everybody,\" at New York's Danceteria, it was clear that something wholly original had happened.\nMadonna Evita publicity still\nMadonna has broken every available radio, video, sales and box office record, racking up no less than 29 Top Ten singles, 11 of those reaching No. 1. Her chart topper, 1994's \"Take A Bow\" lodged in the top spot for seven consecutive weeks and beat the performance of her 1984 breakthrough, \"Like A Virgin\" (which had a six week run at the top). All told, Madonna's No. 1 and No. 2 singles have spent a total of 40 weeks at the top of the charts -- almost a solid year of uninterrupted hits. In one period in the late 1980s, she racked up six straight Top 5 singles, beating the Beatles' old record for back-to-back chart toppers. The single, \"You Must Love Me,\" written especially for the film, Evita by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice was one of the fastest rising singles in the history of Warner Bros.

Madonna's international album sales are estimated at topping 100 million units. Pivotal as recorded music is to Madonna's unparalleled success, she has had more videos, played more often, than any other artist in the history of the MTV network. Multi-awarded for these videos, Madonna made a ground-breaking contribution to the video art form as she had to her unstoppable sell-out music tours which combined music, theatrics, spectacle and dazzling charisma which have packed stadiums globally for nearly three decades. Madonna's film roles began with instant success as wacky Susan in \"Desperately Seeking Susan,\" leading to starring in \"Dick Tracy,\" joining Woody Allen's exclusive repertory foreshadows and Fog\" and Madonna's intriguing documentary performance in \"Truth or Dare\" was an in-your-face personal journey which intrigued audiences and critics alike and led to her debut at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival.\nOriginal service agreement contract for Madonna.\nAntonio Banderas\nThe narrator throughout, the sardonic Brechtian everyman, Che is played by Spanish actor, Antonio Banderas, who made his American film debut in \"Mambo Kings.\" This was closely followed by a number of films including Jonathan Demme's \"Philadelphia,\" starring opposite Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington; Neil Jordan's \"Interview with a Vampire,\" opposite Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt; \"Miami Rhapsody\" with Sarah Jessica Parker; \"The House of the Spirits,\" with Glenn Close, Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons; starring in Robert Rodriquez' \"Desperado\" and \"Four Rooms\"; \"Assassins\" opposite Sylvester Stallone; \"Never Talk to Strangers\" and \"Two Much,\" opposite Melanie Griffith and Daryl Hannah.

The final budget came in at $55 million. In the United States, the film would gross $50 million but overseas boxoffice proved to be excellent, especially in the United Kingdom and so a profit was made from the film, with an additional $17 million coming from its home video releases. Evita was released as a holiday release on December 14, 1996 (the date of its Los Angeles premiere).\nMadonna at the film's premiere\nRoger Ebert said in his review, \"I very much enjoyed the film. Parker's visuals enliven the music, and Madonna and Banderas bring it passion. By the end of the film we feel like we've had our money's worth, and we're sure Evita has.\" Rolling Stone went on to say that \"The hard-working diva brings star qualityto the working-class Eva Peron.\" From the San Francisco Chronicle: \"The protracted, much-anticipated screen version of ``Evita'' turns out to have been worth the wait. Alan Parker's picture is epic, lavish and fascinating. It is not a perfect screen musical, but it is spectacular and it works.\" The New York Times declared, \"The viewer is in for a tumultuous ride. The star looks stunning, breaks the Guinness world record for most costume changes in a single movie and shows off traffic-stopping screen presence in the process.\"\nThe film was nominated for five Academy Awards (Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and won for best song (\"You Must Love Me\").
