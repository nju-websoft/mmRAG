Operation VARSITY: The Last Airborne Deployment of World ... Operation VARSITY: The Last Airborne Deployment of World War II – The Campaign for the National Museum of the United States Army\nOperation VARSITY: The Last Airborne Deployment of World War II\nJanuary 20, 2015\nBy Matthew J. Seelinger\nIn the years prior to World War II, the U.S. Army began to develop the concept of deploying troops from the air.  Starting with the formation of the Parachute Test Platoon on 26 June 1940, the Army experimented with and developed airborne doctrine, deploying soldiers by parachute and by glider behind enemy lines in order to seize and hold bridges and other strategic locations until conventional ground forces could link up with them.  Due to the difficult nature of their mission, the training for these new soldiers, better known as paratroopers, was rigorous, earning them the status of elite soldiers.  Eventually, over the course of World War II, the Army formed five airborne divisions (11th, 13th, 17th, 82d, and 101st) along with several separate parachute infantry regiments and battalions.\nThe Army’s first foray into airborne warfare came with Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, on 8 November 1942, when the 2d Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry, dropped into Algeria, seizing the Tafarquay Airport near Oran.  While this first combat jump proved successful, later operations had mixed results.  During the invasion of Sicily in July 1943, elements of the 82d Airborne Division (“All Americans”) were scattered far from their drop zones, and Allied anti-aircraft fire inflicted significant casualties on the 1st and 2d Battalions, 504th Parachute Infantry, when they shot down twenty-three C-47 transport aircraft in one of the worst friendly fire incidents of the war.  Two months later, in the opening phase of the Allied invasion of mainland Italy in September 1943, two regiments of the 82d, the 504th and 505th Parachute Infantry, conducted two fairly successful combat drops in support of the Allied landings at Salerno.\nWhile conducted on a much larger scale than previous operations, the Allied airborne assault as part of Operation Overlord on 6 June 1944, again was not as successful as hoped.  Carried out at night, paratroopers from both the veteran 82d Airborne Division and the un-blooded 101st Airborne Division (“Screaming Eagles”), along with the British 6th Airborne Division, were scattered far and wide over the Norman countryside.  Fighting in small groups, the American and British paratroopers did much to sow confusion among the German forces and seized several key objectives, but paid a heavy price in dead and wounded.\nIn Southern France, the 1st Airborne Task Force, a provisional division of the Seventh Army consisting of several parachute and glider units, made a night air assault on 15 August 1944 in support of the Allied amphibious landings (Operation Anvil).  Low cloud cover however, caused many paratroopers to be dropped far from their intended landing zones, but as in Normandy, they significantly confused the German forces defending the region.\nIn Operation Market-Garden, a larger operation than D-Day and conducted during daylight hours, the 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions, under the operational control of the First Allied Airborne Army, performed well, seizing their objectives in Holland and holding them until relieved by the British XXX Corps.  Again, however, both divisions suffered heavy casualties, and the operation eventually fell short of its objectives when Allied forces could not reach the British 1st Airborne Division trapped in Arnhem along the Rhine River.\nWhile winter weather prevented any further combat jumps in 1944, American paratroopers accorded themselves in conventional roles during the surprise German offensive through the Ardennes in December 1944, in what became better known as the Battle of the Bulge.  The 101st Airborne Division earned a Presidential Unit Citation for its stubborn defense of Bastogne, Belgium, and forever etched itself in Army lore.  The 82d Airborne Division played an important role in holding the northern shoulder of the Bulge, while the inexperienced 17th Airborne Division was rushed to the front from England and took part in the Allied counteroffensive.\nThe Army also conducted airborne operations in the Pacific Theater, but on a much smaller scale.  The 503d Parachute Infantry Regiment, a separate airborne unit not assigned to a division, was employed during the New Guinea campaign to help the American Sixth Army bypass Japanese strong points.  On 16 February 1945, the 503d parachuted onto the fortress island of Corregidor and helped recapture the site where the last American forces in the Philippines surrendered to the Japanese nearly three years before.  Another airborne unit, the 11th Airborne Division, fought in the New Guinea, Leyte, and Luzon campaigns.  While the division’s 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment conducted two parachute assaults, including one to liberate prisoners at the Japanese internment camp at Los Banos on 23 February 1945, the 11th Airborne fought largely as a conventional infantry division.\nAs the western Allies advanced east into Germany in early 1945, they faced a number of obstacles.  In addition to stiff German resistance, numerous rivers slowed the Allies’ march.  In particular, the Rhine River, with its treacherous currents and steep banks, formed a particularly strong  natural  defensive barrier for the Wehrmacht.  Few if any bridges would remain standing, so Allied forces would have to make amphibious assaults across the river.  As Allied leaders began planning for the Rhine crossings, they also examined the possibility of employing airborne forces in a parachute drop on the east bank of the Rhine in support of any amphibious assault.  What resulted was Operation Varsity, the 17th Airborne Division’s first combat air assault and the last major airborne operation of World War II.  It was also arguably the war’s most successful combat parachute drop.  While tactically successful, however, some Allied officers (and later historians) questioned if Varsity was ever necessary, and whether the casualties incurred by the operation were worth what was gained.\nPlanning for possible Allied airborne assaults across the Rhine actually began shortly before the Battle of the Bulge.     Eventually, the staff of the First Allied Airborne Army (FAAA), commanded by LTG Lewis H. Brereton, drew up plans for three Allied airborne landings across the Rhine:  Operation Varsity, in support of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery’s 21st Army Group’s crossing at Wesel; Operation Choker II, which would support LTG Alexander Patch’s Seventh Army crossings at Worms; and Operation Naples II, part of GEN Omar N. Bradley’s 12th Army Group’s assault across the Rhine at Cologne.  In addition to the three drops east of the Rhine River, FAAA planners also generated preliminary plans for an American drop to occupy Berlin (Operation Eclipse) should Nazi Germany suddenly collapse.\nBy 1 February, FAAA officers began to focus their resources on two airborne operations:  Varsity, in support of Montgomery, and Choker II, in support of an American crossing.  In fact, Montgomery emphatically insisted on airborne support for his anticipated crossing at Wesel. Naples II and Eclipse were abandoned.  LTG Brereton assigned his deputy, MG Richard N. Gale, who also commanded the British 1st Airborne Corps, as the chief planner and commander of the operation.  Montgomery and British Second Army commander LTG Miles Dempsey, who would spearhead the amphibious crossing, drew up a plan using three airborne divisions:  MG Eric Bol’s British 6th and two American divisions, MG Elbridge G. Chapman’s 13th and MG William (Bud) Miley’s 17th.  Preliminary plans for Choker II called for the employment of the 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions.\nGale soon lost the confidence of both Montgomery and Dempsey and was replaced by MG Matthew B. Ridgway, commander of the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, who had much more experience in planning and leading airborne operations.  Ridgway, however, was not eager to take on this new task.    He had successfully led his corps in conventional operations during the Battle of the Bulge and was hoping to take command of an army if the opportunity arose.  Leading an “unconventional” operation, he believed, such as an airborne drop across the Rhine, would only hurt his chances.  He requested that he remain with the LTG Courtney Hodges’s First Army until it reached the Rhine, then he would command Choker II.  GEN Dwight D. Eisenhower, the overall Allied commander in Western Europe, however, overruled Ridgway and ordered him to command Varsity.\nRidgway did all he could to get out of the assignment but to no avail–Montgomery’s decision was final.  On 13 February, MG John Millikin’s III Corps replaced XVIII Airborne Corps.  Ridgway and his staff returned to their old corps headquarters in Epernay, France, to continue planning for both Varsity and Choker II.  At the same time, the 17th, 82d, and 101st Airborne Divisions were pulled from the line and returned to their former bases near Reims for rest and refitting prior to the jumps over the Rhine.\nUnlike Sicily and Normandy, the airborne drops in support of the Rhine crossings would commence after the amphibious operations (Operation Plunder) had begun.  Also, to avoid the problems that plagued earlier operations such as Market-Garden, where British paratroopers and gliders were deployed in waves over several days, and where soldiers were forced to march several miles to reach their objectives in Arnhem, Varsity called for airborne forces to be dropped almost all at once at landing zones as close as possible to their objectives.  The 17th Airborne Division would land in the southern portion of the drop zones, while the British 6th Airborne would take the northern area.  The operation would also take place during daylight hours, which had the disadvantage of exposing the slow flying gliders and transport aircraft to German anti-aircraft fire.  Allied planners did consider a night jump to decrease the danger of flak, but that was ruled out due to the threat posed by enemy night fighter planes.  A daytime operation also had the advantage of allowing paratroopers and glider-borne personnel to more easily see where they were upon landing, assemble quickly, and locate the enemy.\nFurthermore, the plan called for the airborne troops to land within range of Allied artillery support on the west bank of the Rhine, and the areas around the landing zones would be hit by heavy bombers prior to the drop.  In addition, hundreds of Allied fighter-bombers would provide close-air support to the troops once they were on the ground, and a formation of B-24 Liberator bombers would make a high-speed, low-level supply drop within hours of the landings.\nRidgway remained concerned about a repeat of Market-Garden, when unexpectedly heavy German resistance delayed XXX Corps’ advance and forced the airborne forces to hold their objectives for longer than planned.  Dempsey promised Ridgway that the link-up with Second Army would occur quickly, with two divisions reaching the airborne forces in no more than forty-eight hours.  Ridgway, however, remained somewhat leery of Dempsey’s promise.  Ridgway had blamed much of Market-Garden’s failure on Dempsey’s lack of aggressiveness in pushing British ground forces forward.\nPlanning for Varsity went on into March, with a number of changes being made before the operation’s plans were finalized.  Montgomery set the date for 24 March.  Because the Allied airlift capability was limited, the assault would employ two airborne divisions rather than the original three.  While the 17th Airborne had not made a combat jump to date, it did have combat experience, having taken part in the effort to drive the Germans out of the Ardennes.  As a result, the 13th Airborne Division was dropped from the operation and would never see combat as a division, although some of its personnel were employed as replacements.\nRidgway decided that he and XVIII Corps headquarters would cross the Rhine by landing craft after the airborne drops, which caused COL Edson Raff, commander of the 507th Parachute Infantry, to unfairly comment that Ridgway was not “a real paratrooper that would jump with his men.”  In fact, the decision was a sound one.  Instead of placing himself in harm’s way on a chaotic battlefield with poor communications at best, Ridgway could maintain clear communication with both British and American forces and better maintain operational control.  Furthermore, unbeknownst to most outside of Ridgway’s staff, he was suffering from acute back pain that was only alleviated by a doctor’s injection of Novocain directly into his back muscles.\nThe two remaining divisions would be dropped east of Wesel in an area between the town and the Issel River, where they would seize the Diersfordterwald, the town of Hamminkeln, and several bridges over the Issel.  They would also prevent the Germans from rushing reinforcements to counter the amphibious landings.\nOn 7 March, Montgomery’s massive Rhine crossing  was unexpectedly upstaged when elements of the U.S. 9th Armored Division,  part of the First Army’s III Corps, seized the Ludendorff Bridge, the last intact bridge spanning the Rhine, at Remagen.  In addition to suddenly changing the course of the war in the West, and relegating the northern Rhine crossings to somewhat of a sideshow, the Remagen bridgehead eliminated the need for airborne support for Bradley’s 12th Army Group.  As a result, Allied planners cancelled Choker II and Naples II, as well as Operation Arena, an even more ambitious plan that called for an airborne drop of several divisions 100 miles east of the Rhine, followed by an airlift of several conventional infantry divisions.\nMajor General William M. “Bud” Miley commanded the 17th Airborne from its activation on 15 April 1943 until the division’s inactivation on 16 September 1945. (Taken from 17th Airborne Division—Thunderbolt)\nThe American division for Varsity, the 17th Airborne, was commanded by MG William M. (Bud) Miley, a veteran airborne officer who had previously served as assistant division commander of the 82d Airborne when Ridgway commanded the division.  Unlike the British 6th Airborne, the 17th had yet to make a combat jump, although it had seen heavy combat during the Battle of the Bulge.\nAfter a reorganization of all American airborne divisions in early 1945, the 17th consisted of three regiments (two parachute and one glider infantry), four field artillery battalions, and various combat support units.  Under the airborne division reorganization, each regiment was permanently assigned a field artillery battalion, forming a combat team.  The 507th Parachute Infantry, which had taken part in the drop into Normandy on D-Day while assigned to the 82d Airborne, was commanded by COL Edson Raff.  On the other hand, the 513th Parachute Infantry, commanded by COL James W. Coutts, and the 194th Glider Infantry, commanded by COL James R. Pierce,  had yet to make a combat airborne assault.\nThe soldiers of the 17th Airborne would employ a number of new weapons.  As an improvement over the largely ineffective shoulder-fired anti-tank rocket launcher, better known as the bazooka, the 17th’s paratroopers and glider infantry were equipped with a new shoulder-fired 57mm recoilless rifle, as well as a more powerful, tripod-mounted 75mm recoilless rifle.  While they still carried plenty of bazookas in combat, the relatively lightly armed airborne soldiers now had weapons that could more effectively deal with German armor.\nVarsity also introduced a new aircraft, the C-46 Commando, for deploying airborne troops.  The C-46 could carry twice as many paratroopers as the C-47 Dakota (thirty-six, an entire platoon, versus eighteen).  Furthermore, the C-46 was faster and had doors on either side of the cabin, allowing troops to exit the aircraft quickly.  One drawback for Varsity planners was that only 75 C-46s would be available, and most soldiers would still be carried by the older, slower C-47s.  Coutts’ 513th Parachute Infantry was assigned to the new aircraft.  In the weeks before the operation, the soldiers of the 513th made a number of practice jumps from C-46s to familiarize themselves with the new aircraft.  Despite its advantages, the C-46 would prove to have a fatal flaw that only became apparent during the actual combat drop, with tragic consequences.\nAfter being withdrawn from the front lines in February 1945, the 17th Airborne Division was bivouacked at a dozen airfields around Paris.  The relatively short distance to the landing zones in Germany allowed transport planes to double tow two Waco CG-4A gliders bearing soldiers and equipment and eliminated the need for additional flights.  While waiting for D-Day for Varsity, still planned for 24 March, the soldiers of the 17th rigorously trained and readied equipment and weapons for their upcoming mission.  As the date for the operation approached, chaplains held services for the men and many soldiers attended.\nOn the night of 23 March, elements of Dempsey’s Second Army began crossing the Rhine under the cover of darkness.  The bulk of the amphibious forces, including elements of the American XVI Corps, part of LTG William Simpson’s Ninth Army, would also cross in the dark before sunrise on the morning of the 24th.  Massive amounts of Allied artillery, along with a huge smoke screen, also supported the crossings.  Shortly after the Rhine crossings commenced, Second Army’s headquarters flashed the message, “Two if by sea,” to the airborne forces, setting Operation Varsity into motion.  The soldiers of the 17th Airborne were served a hearty breakfast of steak and eggs before being loaded into trucks and taken to the aircraft and gliders which would transport them to Germany.\n17th Airborne paratroopers board a C-46 Commando transport that will drop them over the east bank of the Rhine River during Operation VARSITY, 24 March 1945. (National Archives)\nThe first planes carrying the 17th Airborne took off shortly after 0700, with the last getting aloft just before 0900.  The airborne lift included a total of 9,387 paratroopers and glider-borne soldiers, carried aboard 72 C-46s, 836 C-47s, and 906 CG-4A gliders.  This, combined with   the British airborne armada of nearly 800 aircraft and 420 gliders, carrying over 8,000 soldiers, stretched nearly 200 miles and took thirty-seven minutes to pass a given point.  The two formations rendezvoused in the skies near Brussels, Belgium, before proceeding to the drop zones 100 miles away.  In addition, nearly 1,000 Allied fighters escorted the transports.  For those watching below, including GEN Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, it was an impressive display of Allied might.  MG James M. Gavin, commander of the 82d Airborne Division, who had never witnessed a major airborne operation from the ground, called it “an awesome spectacle.”\nThe first aircraft carrying the 17th Airborne reached the target area at 0953, slightly ahead of schedule.  While the weather was sunny and bright, the drop zones were obscured by haze caused by the massive smoke screen covering the river crossings and Allied artillery.  As a result, the first troops from the 1st Battalion, 507th Parachute Infantry, which included COL Raff, the regimental commander, landed nearly two miles away from their planned drop zone.  Raff gathered a group of paratroopers together, while MAJ Paul Smith, the battalion commander, organized another, and both set out to take their objectives and to eliminate enemy positions firing on the landing zones.\nAs Smith’s force took out some German anti-aircraft positions, Raff’s group eliminated several machine guns and rooted out some dug in infantry.  As Raff’s men worked their way south to the regimental objective, the town of Diersfordter, they spotted a battery of 150mm guns firing from a clearing in some nearby woods.  Raff’s men quickly eliminated the battery, killing fifty-five Germans and capturing over 300.\nThe 2d and 3d Battalions of the 507th, commanded by LTC Charles Timmes and LTC Allen Taylor, respectively, along with LTC Edward S. Branigan’s 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion, landed on their assigned drop zones, assembled quickly, and set out to seize Diersfordter and the castle that dominated the area.  Two German tanks emerged from the castle grounds, but both were quickly knocked out, one by a well-placed shot from a 57mm recoilless rifle, the first successful use of the weapon in combat.  By 1500, resistance in the castle ended after Company G cleared the structure room by room.  The troopers collected over 300 prisoners, including a number of senior officers from the German LXXXVI Corps and 84th Infantry Division.\nIn one instance, a stick of paratroopers from the 507th’s Company G came under fire from German riflemen and a machine gun shortly after hitting the ground.  As the troopers struggled to get out of their harnesses, PVT George J. Peters charged the enemy machine gun position alone.  Despite being hit and knocked down twice, he continued his one-man assault and eliminated the gun with grenades.  Peters died shortly after from his wounds and was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor.\nWithin a couple of hours, the 507th had taken most of its objectives, taking 1,000 prisoners, destroying five tanks, and capturing or destroying several batteries of artillery.  Compared to other units in the 17th Airborne Division, the 507th Combat Team’s casualties had been light–about 150 killed and wounded.  Shortly after Raff set up his regimental command post, MG Miley established the divisional headquarters in the nearby village of Fluren to await the eventual arrival of Ridgway and the XVIII Airborne Corps staff.\nUnlike the 507th’s drop, which faced relatively light anti-aircraft fire, the planes carrying the 513th Parachute Infantry ran into an intense flak barrage as they approached the drop zones.  Many enemy gun positions survived the Allied aerial and artillery bombardment and now turned their attention to the low-flying transport planes and descending paratroopers overhead.\nAlmost immediately, the C-46’s fatal flaw became apparent.  The planes lacked self-sealing fuel tanks; if a fuel tank was punctured, high octane aviation gas would stream along the wings towards the fuselage.  All it took was a single spark to turn each plane into a flying inferno.  German 20mm incendiary rounds proved extremely lethal and set several damaged aircraft ablaze.  Ridgway later reported that the heaviest losses during Varsity came during the first thirty minutes of the 513th’s drop.  Nineteen of the seventy-two C-46s were lost, with fourteen going down in flames, some with paratroopers on board.  Another thirty-eight were severely damaged.  Many soldiers wounded during the flight to the drop zones chose to jump and take their chances rather than remain in the dangerously flawed aircraft.  After Varsity, Ridgway issued orders prohibiting the use of C-46s in future airborne operations.\nThe C-46 carrying the 513th’s commander, COL Coutts, was hit by long-range anti-aircraft fire and was ablaze as it crossed the Rhine.  Coutt’s stick managed to hook up one wounded  soldier and shove him out of the plane before the rest followed.\nUpon hitting the ground, Coutts and his men came under intense small arms fire.  Many more were hit on the way down.  Hundreds of British paratroopers scrambled about, and British gliders soon began landing all around.  Coutts first believed that the British had landed in the wrong zone, but soon realized that his regiment had been dropped in the British sector about a mile and a half from Hamminkeln.\nAfter assembling under heavy fire, the battalions of the 513th fought their way south towards their assigned objectives, destroying two tanks, a self-propelled gun, and two batteries of 88mm guns.  One battalion reached the Issel River, the easternmost of the first day’s objectives.  The 507th, however, in being dropped in the wrong area, had already seized many of the 513th’s objectives by the time they reached their intended drop zones.\nAs the 513th’s Company E advanced south, it came under heavy fire from some buildings.  Machine guns immediately pinned down one platoon.  With complete disregard for his own safety, PFC Stuart S. Stryker rose and led a charge towards the enemy.  Stryker was cut down by enemy fire, but his actions rallied others in the company, and shortly thereafter, they overran the German position, taking over 200 German prisoners and freeing three American airmen who had been shot down and captured.  Stryker was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions, the second trooper from the 17th Airborne to earn the Medal of Honor during Varsity.\nThe 513th’s supporting artillery, the 466th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion, commanded by LTC Ken Booth, landed on the correct drop zone southeast of Hamminkeln, but enemy fire there was more intense than that faced by the infantry.  German fire took a heavy toll among the battalion’s officers, and many artillerymen were forced to fight as infantry while others assembled their 75mm pack howitzers and gathered ammunition and equipment.  Despite the intense fire, the artillerymen assembled several of their guns within a half hour and were soon firing at German targets.  By 1200, the 466th had captured ten German 76mm guns and were providing artillery support for the 513th Parachute Infantry.\nAmong the 466th were two VIP observers from the States:  BG Ridgley M. Gaither, commandant of the Parachute School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and BG Josiah T. Dalbey, commander of the Airborne Training Center at Camp Mackall, North Carolina.  Dalbey personally led a successful attack on a battery of 20mm anti-aircraft guns that was pouring a deadly fire on the Americans.\nBy approximately 1530, the 513th Combat Team had reached all of its objectives, taking over 1,500 Germans prisoner in the process.  Compared with the 507th, however, the 513th suffered far heavier casualties.  For their actions in Varsity, the 513th Parachute Infantry and the 466th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion earned a Presidential Unit Citation.\nThe first American glider troops (COL Pierce’s 194th Glider Infantry Regiment and LTC Joseph W. Keating’s 681st Glider Field Artillery Battalion in double towed gliders) begin arriving at around 1030, with most reaching the correct landing zones despite the haze and heavy ground fire.  German flak took a heavy toll on the 295 tow aircraft–twelve were shot down, another fourteen were  forced to make crash landings, and 126 suffered heavy damage.  Six CG-4A gliders were shot down, and most of the incoming craft were damaged on their final landing approach.  German automatic weapons and rifle fire raked many of the gliders once they were on the ground. Unlike previous air assaults, Varsity marked the first time gliders came down in landing zones not already secured by paratroopers.  Eighteen glider pilots were killed and another eighty were wounded or injured in crashes.\nGlider infantrymen from the 194th Gilder Infantry Regiment, 17th Airborne Division, begin moving out towards their objectives, 24 March 1945. (National Archives)\nThe second wave of American glider troops (LTC Paul F. Oswald’s 680th Glider Field Artillery Battalion, recently re-equipped with short-barreled 105mm howitzers, and various support elements) transported in single tow gliders, arrived around 1200.  Anti-aircraft fire had subsided considerably, but it still took a toll–three C-47s and one glider were shot down and dozens of each were damaged.  Fourteen glider pilots were killed and another twenty-six were wounded or injured.\nThe air supply operation followed within minutes of the last glider landing.  Again, German anti-aircraft fire took a heavy toll on the 240 low flying B-24s, shooting down fifteen and badly damaging 104.  The drops to the American forces were scattered and only fifty percent of the air dropped bundles were recovered.  Further aerial supply drops were cancelled, partly because of the heavy aircraft losses, but also because the Allied amphibious forces were making good progress.\nBy 1200, most of the 194th Glider Infantry and its attached 681st Glider Field Artillery Battalion had assembled under heavy fire amid the wreckage of dozens of gliders.  By 1400, the 194th Combat Team, eager to prove that glider troops were on par with the vaunted paratroopers, had accomplished most of its assigned missions.  While suffering heavy casualties, the 194th took 1,150 prisoners, eliminated fifty artillery pieces, and destroyed ten tanks.  Several tanks were knocked out by anti-tank teams carrying bazookas.  PVT Robert Weber destroyed one tank from several hundred yards away when he miraculously dropped a bazooka round into the open hatch of the approaching panzer.\nOne new innovation employed by the 194th was to train the 875 glider pilots and co-pilots in rudimentary battlefield tactics in the weeks before Varsity, organize them into a provisional battalion of four companies, and assign them specific infantry missions.  In previous operations, some pilots had guarded prisoners and command posts after landing their gliders, but most had nothing to do and often “got in the way.”  The pilots were enthusiastic about their new mission and accorded themselves well.  On the night of 24 March, one company of pilots repulsed  a German counterattack on the 194th’s perimeter.\nThe 17th’s “divisional” artillery, LTC Oswald’s  680th Glider Field Artillery Battalion, also accorded itself well.  Upon landing, while some gunners fought as infantry to clear Germans firing on the landing zone, the rest assembled nine 105mm howitzers and gathered ammunition and equipment from the smashed gliders.  By the end of the day, the 680th had captured 150 Germans and two batteries of  enemy artillery, and provided artillery support for the 17th Airborne, earning the battalion a Presidential Unit Citation.  The 680th’s losses, however, were heavy–nineteen killed and fifty-six wounded.\nAt 1458, patrols from the British 1st Commando Brigade marching out of Wesel reached elements of the 17th Airborne, marking the first juncture of airborne and amphibious units in Plunder/Varsity.  This was also the fastest link-up of ground and airborne forces in the war–about five hours.\nBy the early afternoon, Ridgway crossed the Rhine in an amphibious tracked vehicle and reached Miley’s headquarters at 1526.  Miley explained to Ridgway that the operation had been going well, that he was in radio contact with all units, and that all combat teams were fighting as cohesive units and had reached almost all of their objectives, save for the bridges over the Issel River and Issel Canal (they would be taken later in the day).\nRidgway radioed the news to the XVIII Airborne Corps headquarters still in Xanthen on the western side of the Rhine before setting out in a three jeep convoy to visit the rest of the 17th Airborne and British 6th Airborne Division.  At around midnight, Ridgway’s party ran into a German patrol and a sharp firefight ensued.  Ridgway emptied his weapon and was reloading when a German grenade exploded under his jeep.  A fragment lodged in Ridgway’s shoulder, resulting in a painful but relatively minor wound.  He received a Purple Heart but ignored a doctor’s advice to have the fragment removed and carried it with him for the rest of his life.\nIn the days following 24 March, XVIII Airborne Corps consolidated and expanded its sector and prepared for the drive east into the heart of Hitler’s Reich.  The corps would soon be attached to the U.S. Ninth Army and Bradley’s 12th Army Group, and take part in the encirclement of the Ruhr, one of the last major operations in western Germany before V-E Day on 8 May 1945.\nWhile tactically successful, many U.S. Army officers at the time, and later, historians studying Varsity, questioned whether the operation should have ever been conducted.  While performing spectacularly in its first combat airborne assault, the 17th Airborne Division alone lost 159 killed, 522 wounded, and 840 missing (many of whom would later turn up in the following days and fight again).  IX Troop Carrier Command lost another 41 killed, 153 wounded, and 163 missing.  Fifty gliders and forty-four transport aircraft were destroyed, another 332 transport planes were damaged, and only a few of the gliders were salvageable.  British losses among the 6th Airborne Division were even heavier, especially in the number of  killed.\nIn his wartime memoir, A Soldier’s Story, GEN Bradley contended that the Germans had diverted the bulk of their forces east of the Rhine to the Remagen bridgehead, leaving weak forces around Wesel.  He added that if Montgomery had crossed the Rhine on the run as Hodges and Patton did, or had allowed Simpson to do so with his Ninth Army, Varsity would never have been necessary, and that the operation was typical Montgomery overkill.  Other officers had even harsher words, claiming that Montgomery used airborne forces to simply “put on a good show” and to further to his own standing as a military genius.\nIn The Last Offensive, the U.S. Army’s official account of Operation Varsity and the final drive into Germany, Charles B. MacDonald, a veteran infantry officer who had served with the 23d Infantry, 2d Infantry Division, in Europe in World War II, stated that with the weak condition of German units east of the Rhine, “some overbearing need for the special capability of airborne divisions would be required to justify their use, ” and that the specific need never existed.  MacDonald also contended that while the objectives were important, he believed that ground forces could have taken them without difficulty, and in all likelihood, with fewer casualties.  As evidence, he pointed out that the amphibious crossings faced very little resistance; the two American divisions in the river assault, the 30th and 79th Infantry Divisions, lost a total of forty-one killed, 450 wounded, and seven missing.  James A. Huston, in his book, Out of the Blue:  U.S. Army Airborne Operations in World War II, agreed with MacDonald, adding that “had the same resources been employed on the ground, it is conceivable that the advance to the east may have been more rapid than it was.”  On the other hand, FAAA commander LTG Brereton described Varsity as “a tremendous success,” and Ridgway would claim in his after action report that Varsity was the decisive factor in Montgomery’s Rhine crossing.\nAt the end of 24 March 1945, MG Miley was justifiably proud of his 17th Airborne Division.  In its first combat drop, the division conducted a spectacular operation and achieved its objectives quickly despite the chaos inherent in a massive airborne assault.  Whether or not Operation Varsity was actually necessary will be continue to be debated, but that in no way diminishes the courage and resourcefulness demonstrated by the soldiers who proudly served in the 17th Airborne Division, and in the process, wrote another chapter in the history of the U.S. Army and the American airborne forces.\nPosted In:\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\n1st Battalion (Airborne), 501st Infantry Unit ... into occupied Holland.

The famous test platoon, the prime ancestor of all American Parachute Units, provided the nucleus of the 1st Parachute Battalion, which in turn provided part of the cadre, the unit number, the genealogical lineage and the heraldic background of the 501st Parachute Regiment. It's initial group of officers were hand picked by its first commander, Colonel Howard Johnson, known by his peers as \"Skeets\". He was very much in the swashbuckling mold of most of the original parachute regimental commanders, of whom the popular saying was \"To command a parachute unit, you don't have to be nuts, but it helps!\"\nAn Annapolis graduate, who had boxed while a midshipman, Johnson had transferred to the Army on graduation and had most recently been at the tank destroyer center before volunteering for parachute duty. To say that he took to parachuting is a gross understatement: he ate, slept, and breathed it, and jumped whenever he possibly could, often jumping many times in a single day. His nickname among his men became \"Jumpy Johnson\". He was a zealot on physical conditioning, for himself and everyone in his regiment, and personally led calisthenics, running and all other physical activities. He set a record for running up Currahee Mountain (which loomed over Camp Toccoa) and challenged anyone in the regiment to beat his time. A heavy punching bag hung outside his quarters, and when not punching that, Johnson could often be seen throwing his huge knife at hanging plywood replicas of Hitler and Hirohito. Johnson was no less attentive to the mental conditioning of his new men, ensuring their mental toughness and imbuing them with his own intense dedication to fighting and to defeating our enemies, truly, Johnson created a regiment in his own image.\nAll members of the regiment were parachute volunteers, but only a minor fraction were actually qualified jumpers during training at Camp Toccoa. So, when that very arduous training was over, in March 1943, the unit marched to Atlanta, GA (a distance of 105 miles). They then moved to Fort Benning, GA to jump train all members not previously qualified.\nWith jump training over, the regiment was assigned to the Airborne Command at Camp MacKall, NC. This was its home base during prolonged maneuvers in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Louisiana, and until January 1944, when the regiment deployed to England, by way of Camp Myles Standish, MA. Once in England the 501st became a permanent attachment of the 101st Airborne Division and was a vital part of that famous unit for the duration of World War II.\nIn England, training was as hard and realistic as ever, and became increasingly oriented toward an airborne assault into German held Europe. Though none of the soldiers knew this initially, the regiment was actually training for Operation Overlord, the super-secret allied plan for the combined air, naval, amphibious, and airborne operations to breach Hitler's \"Atlantic Wall\". As D-Day drew closer, a few key commanders and staff were briefed on the part the 101st would play in Operation Overlord.\nThen with D-Day just days away, the 501st with the rest of the division, was sequestered in well guarded marshaling camps, where every man finally learned not only his own mission, but the overall mission of the 501st and the 101st Airborne Division (these very extensive and intensive briefings were to pay big dividends during actual operations). In a nutshell, the 501st (less 3rd Battalion) was to take off from Merryfield Airport at 2245, June 5, 1944, 3rd Battalion was to depart at the same time from Welford. All units were to fly across the English Channel and drop into Normandy, five hours prior to the seaborne landing. The 501st drop zones were north and east of the town of Carentan. Two battalions were to seize key canal locks at La Barquette and destroy bridges over the Douve River, while the third battalion was in division reserve.\nThe many books written on the night drop into Normandy, all point out the break-up of the troop carrier formations, from a combination of low clouds, and enemy anti-aircraft fire. This caused highly scattered drops, in most cases not on or near planned drop zones. Accordingly, actions that night bore little resemblance to those so carefully planned and briefed. Amazingly, the regiment (and the division) accomplished its multiple missions, but none of them as rehearsed. The successes were the result of the initiative, stamina, and daring of the individual parachutists, who each assessed his own situation on landing, decided how best to accomplish some part of the overall mission. Typical was the capture of a key causeway from Utah Beach, at Pouppeville, by a scratch force of about 100 officers and men, formed around a nucleus from the 3rd Battalion (division reserve) of the 501st. Members of this ad hoc force included both General Maxwell Taylor and Assistant Division Commander Gerald Higgins. General Taylor quipped that, \"Never were so few led by so many\".\nFierce fighting in Normandy by no means ended with D-Day, but continued with important results in assisting the amphibious landings and joining the beach at Utah to that at Omaha. The gallant efforts of the 501st were at high cost; the regiment lost 898 men killed, wounded, missing, or captured.\nReturning to its base in England, in mid July, the 501st slowly regained its' pre D-Day capabilities with many replacements and another round of intensive training. There was good news of a presidential citation for actions in Normandy, and many planned assaults into France, which aborted as the allies overran, planned objectives. Then, in the early fall of 1944, plans were made for what was not a \"dry run\", the airborne assault into occupied Holland. Code name \"Market Garden\", it combined a deep airborne thrust, through western Holland, by the 1st Allied Airborne Army, with an overland drive by the British 2nd Army. The plan visualized airborne forces seizing key bridges over rivers and canals, so 2nd Army could move very deep, very fast, a distance of over 100 miles, past the Rhine River, the last major water obstacle short of Berlin. This airborne assault would be made in daylight. The 101st Airborne Division was assigned the southernmost bridges at Eindhoven, Zon, Saint Oedenrode and Vechel, with the 501 st assigned the Vechel Bridges.\nThe airborne assault went as scheduled, on 17 September 1944, with an improved performance by troop carrier units. Most drop zones were hit, with good drop patterns.\n1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, however, was dropped some 5 miles east of its planned drop zone. In spite of this, the four bridges in Vechel were captured intact. Then began the really difficult part of the operation, keeping open the highway over which 2nd Army must pass to reach the 1st British Airborne Division, which was fighting for its life at the northern end of the airborne corridor. The fatal flaw in the plan became more evident each day as the forces proved too few to both keep open the key highway and also fight on to a linkup with the 1st British Airborne, across the Rhine. The 1st British Airborne Division paid the full price for this flaw as they went down fighting against overwhelming odds; less than two thousand men escaped death or capture.\nThe 501st with the rest of the division, moved from initial objective areas to positions on \"the island\" between the Waal and Rhine Rivers; it became clear that they would not be withdrawn from Holland after a few days, as they had been told; our combat skills were too much needed by the British. The prolonged fighting on \"the island\" was anything but the way to use an airborne unit. After the initial hard fighting it became a static war of patrolling and attrition, principally by artillery and mortars. One such mortar attack, near Heteran, on 8 October 1944, fatally wounded Colonel Johnson. As he was being evacuated, his last words to LTC Ewell were, \"Take care of my boys\".\nColonel Johnson was the best-known loss, but with him they lost 661 other fine soldiers. LTC Julian Ewell, a taciturn West Pointer, succeeded COL Johnson. Much less an extrovert than Johnson, he more than made up for any lack of \"flash and dash\" with a keen mind, tactical prescience and all around professional competence.\nAfter 72 days of combat in Holland the division returned to a new staging area, in Mourmelon, France, for what everyone thought would be a long, well deserved rest. Accordingly, many men were on leave or pass, the Division Commander was in the United States, the Assistant Division Commander was in England (leaving the Artillery Commander, General McAuliffe, in command), and there still were major shortages of equipment and supplies, not replaced after Holland.\nTo put it mildly, the division was ill prepared for the word they got in the late evening of December 17th. The Germans had launched a major offensive at dawn on 16 December, through the Ardennes, in the lightly held sector of our VII Corps. At that time Shears Reserve consisted of our division and the 82nd. We were ordered to move \"truchborne\" to Bastogne, the hub town of a major radial road net, to stem the oncoming Germans. General McAuliffe ordered the more by regimental combat teams, without waiting for any absentees. The 501st was the lead combat team in the division move, and after a grueling truck ride, reached Bastogne about 2230 hrs. Thus, by midnight, the 501st was the first and only regiment combat team ready for action. Ewell asked McAuliffe for a definite assignment and was ordered to move out on the eastern road, through Longvilly and seize and hold a key road junction beyond Longvilly. Thus, the 501st was the first to fight at Bastogne, when its battalion ran into the enemy near Neffe, a few kilometers out of Bastogne.\nThus began the heroic defense of Bastogne in which the 501st gave up not one foot of ground, and in which the division, and its comrades in arms, stopped cold everything the Germans could throw at them, ruined Hitler's offensive time table and eventually won the 101st, the first presidential unit citation ever awarded to a full division.\nOnce again, the 501st paid a dear price of 580 killed, wounded or captured. One casualty was Colonel Ewell, who was badly wounded and relinquished command to LTC Robert Ballard, who had commanded 2nd Battalion from the beginning. Bob Ballard was a quiet, Floridian, who was not a professional soldier like Johnson or Ewell, but a fine officer who had learned how to command quietly and effectively while winning the admiration and respect of his men. Ballard continued in command of the 501st until the end of World War II.\nOperations after Bastogne would have been anti-climatic under most any circumstances, accept for the light skirmishing in Alsace, and the drive into Germany's last redoubt, Bavaria, truly seemed like a cakewalk. The living in Germany after V -day was good indeed, but rudely interrupted by orders to move back to billets in Joigny and Auxerre, France (and P.S., don't try to take any of those captured cars or loot with you!)\nOnce in France the 50 I sl tried to get enthused about training for an invasion of Japan, but quite honestly, their hearts were not in it; they felt they had done their share, and that someone else should finish off Japan. On 20 August 1945, the 501st was disbanded, ahead of the inactivation of the 101st Division in November 1945.\nThe 501st was reconstituted I August 1946 as the 501st Parachute Infantry Battalion, at Fort Benning, GA., but was inactivated at Fort Benning, 23 November 1948. Then, between 1951 and 1956 the 501st served with the 101st as a regular army training unit on two occasions, once at Camp Breckinridge, KY., and once at Fort Jackson, SC. In the spring of 1056, the 501 sl and the 101st, moved (less personnel and equipment) to Fort Campbell, KY., where they were activated as a provisional organization to test the \"Pentomic\" concept. The word pentomic referred to the five battle groups, which were in lieu of regiments and to the division's organic atomic weapon capability. One of the five battle groups was the First Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry. Its first commander was COL Harry Kinnard, who had been a member of the WWII regiment and also G-3 of the division from Holland. As to matters on lineage, on 25 April 1957, the 501st Regiment ceased to exist as a tactical unit and was redesignated as the 501st Infantry, a parent regiment under the combat arms regimental system. Simultaneously, on the same date, 1st BN, 501st Infantry was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry, and remained assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (organic elements were concurrently constituted and activated).\nBelieve it or not, an element of the 501st actually served with the 82nd Airborne Division when the 82nd reconfigured in the pentomic format. On I September 1957, the 2nd Bn, 501st Infantry was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry as an organic element of the 82nd Airborne Division, and activated at Fort Bragg, NC (concurrently, organic elements constituted and activated at Fort Bragg).\nWhen the pentomic concept gave way to the road division, with brigades and battalions instead of battle groups, the 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry became the 2nd Bn, 501st Infantry. On 1 February 1964, it was relieved from assignment to the 82nd and assigned to the 101st at Fort Campbell, KY. The 101st was also becoming a road type airborne division, and the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry became the 1st Bn, 501st Infantry, of the 101st.\nThus, when the 101st fought again, in South Vietnam, it included the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 501st. The division participated in twelve campaigns and was decorated by the Republic of Vietnam on three occasions. The 2nd Battalion, 501st, while attached to the 3rd Brigade, 101st received a presidential unit citation for the heroic actions of all elements of that brigade, in the bloody fight at Hill #937, in the Ashau Valley. The news media called it \"Hamburger Hill\", but the battle streamer is embroidered: Dong Ap Bia Mountain (because the 501st Regiment automatically shared this honor with the 2nd Battalion, it became one of very few army regiments able to display three Presidential Unit Citation streamers on its colors). In all this unusual and difficult combat, both 501st units performed as bravely as their predecessors had in WWII.\nAs part of the post Vietnam reorganization, the 2nd Bn, 501st Infantry was inactivated on 31 July 1972, and in the restructuring to the U.S. Army regimental system, the 1st Bn, 501st Infantry was inactivated at Fort Campbell on 5 June 1984. Then, in October 1989 the 501st Regiment was reorganized under the U.S. Army Regimental System with Headquarters at Fort Richardson, Alaska. Simultaneously, 1st Bn, 501st Infantry was assigned to the 6th Infantry Division and activated at Fort Richardson.\nIn October 2003, TF 1-501 ABN deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom with the 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. By late 2003 the Task Force was fully established at Forward Operating Base Salerno, vicinity the city of Khowst, near the eastern border of Afghanistan. To get there, the Geronimo gathered their vehicles and equipment at Bagram air base, AND THEN proceeded to drive over 150 miles of some of the most treacherous roads on earth. TF 1-501 conducted combat operations in the vicinity of FOB Salerno, participating in numerous operations including AVALANCHE, BLIZZARD, and STORM. TF 1-501 became known as one of most the successful deployments in the Global War on Terrorism. not only capturing key leaders vital to the Al Queda defense, but sustaining no fatal casualties during the entire duration of their deployment. Upon successful redeployment in August 2004, TF 1-501 was expanded into an airborne brigade. Flagged as 4th Brigade (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division. the unit is now the primary strategic response force for the Pacific Theater.Whenever and wherever all or part of the \"Geronimo\" 501st may again be called to take up the tomahawk-Let the enemy beware!!!\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\n... rivers in Holland that would pave the way for ground troops to advance swiftly into Germany and end the war by Christmas of 1944.

World War II: 101st Airborne Division Holds the Line Along ... 6/12/2006 • World War II\n \nFollowing lessons learned in Normandy, General Maxwell Taylor insisted that his men be landed in Holland with a high degree of concentration. The daylight operation enabled troop carrier pilots to drop the 101st closer to their intended landing zones and allowed the paratroopers and glidermen to consolidate more quickly after arriving, as the general had wished. (NATIONAL ARCHIVES)\nIn broad daylight the three parachute infantry regiments of the 101st Airborne Division descended with amazing accuracy on designated drop zones in Nazi-occupied Holland. It was September 17, 1944, and the Screaming Eagles were to play a vital role in Operation Market-Garden. Once the Allied armies had broken out of their D-Day beachhead and through the bocage, or hedgerow country, of France, they advanced rapidly. Disorganized German units retreated before them.\nFixed fortifications, known as the Siegfried Line or West Wall, barred a direct strike into Germany itself. In the northern area of Allied operations, British Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery had devised an ambitious plan to outflank the Siegfried Line and facilitate a drive directly into the Ruhr, the industrial heart of Germany. Montgomery’s plan relied on the First Allied Airborne Army, of which the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, including the 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions, was a part. The commander of this army was Lt. Gen. Lewis H. Brereton.\nThe U.S. airborne troops, who had participated in the D-Day operations, had been resting and absorbing replacements in England since mid-July. For Market-Garden, it was hoped that the Americans, along with the British 1st Airborne Division, would launch a bold strike across the Maas, Waal and Neder Rijn (Rhine) rivers in Holland that would pave the way for ground troops to advance swiftly into Germany and end the war by Christmas of 1944.\nKey to the success of Montgomery’s plan would be the seizure of bridges across rivers and adjacent canals by the airborne troops and swift movement of ground forces up a single highway, spanning roughly 60 miles from the Allied lines in Belgium to the Dutch town of Arnhem. The troops would hold the bridges until relief appeared in the form of the British XXX Corps charging down the single road, crossing the bridges successively and arriving at Arnhem as the vanguard of a larger force pushing southeast into Germany.\nThe 101st would secure the southernmost bridges, including one over the Wilhelmina Canal at the town of Son, a pair spanning the Dommel River at St. Oedenrode and then four more over the Aar River near the town of Veghel. Eindhoven was also to be captured while the men of the 101st held open 15 miles of the road toward Arnhem for the XXX Corps’ use. By the end of their service in Market-Garden, the men of the 101st would refer to this stretch of road as ‘Hell’s Highway.’ Farther north, the 82nd Airborne was ordered to capture the bridge at Grave, the longest in Europe. The 82nd would also take one or more of the four bridges across the Maas-Waal Canal, another bridge over the Waal at Nijmegen and the area around the town of Groesbeek. The final leg of the XXX Corps’ drive involved a dash from Nijmegen to Arnhem, where the British 1st Airborne was to capture and hold three bridges across the Rhine.\nHad Market-Garden succeeded, the war might indeed have been shortened. As it turned out, elements of two SS panzer divisions, the 9th and 10th, had been ordered to the vicinity of the Allied thrust to rest and refit in the days immediately prior to the start of the operation. Also, by coincidence, while Market-Garden was getting underway, the German 59th and 245th Infantry divisions were in transit from the area of the German Fifteenth Army to that of the First Parachute Army–right in the operation’s path.\nIntelligence that indicated strong concentrations of German forces in the proposed area of operations appears to have been ignored by planners. Due to stiff resistance, Operation Market-Garden was doomed to failure. The 1st Airborne fought an epic battle for 10 days in and around Arnhem, but of the nearly 10,000 British paratroopers who participated, just over 2,000 escaped death or captivity.\nOn the afternoon of September 17, the 101st executed a nearly flawless airdrop. All but two of its battalions were delivered to their correct drop zones. Unlike what had happened in the D-Day drops, the transport pilots held their planes steady and on course through anti-aircraft fire rather than taking evasive action that could have scattered the troops. Most units assembled and moved toward their objectives shortly after landing.\nDropping near Son, the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Robert F. Sink, was to capture a bridge over the Wilhelmina Canal and then advance south to Eindhoven. The 502nd, commanded by Colonel John H. Michaelis, would establish a perimeter around its drop zone just north of the 506th so that it could later be used as a glider landing zone. It was then to capture a bridge over the Dommel and take bridges over the Wilhelmina Canal near the town of Best. The 501st, under Colonel Howard R. Johnson, was still farther north, where the regiment was instructed to take both road and rail bridges on the Willems Canal and the Aar River near the town of Veghel.\n \nDouglas C-47 transports line up to receive Allied paratroopers for the jump, and fly toward their targets during what was called one of the division’s most successful landings. (NATIONAL ARCHIVES)\nThe 501st, including its 1st Battalion, which had been dropped in the wrong place, made rapid progress toward its objectives. Lieutenant Colonel Harry W.O. Kinnard, commander of the battalion, gathered his forces and set out in the direction of Veghel. Some of Kinnard’s men commandeered bicycles and trucks, leading the rest of the battalion toward the bridges. When Kinnard arrived on the outskirts of Veghel, his troopers had already taken the railroad bridge over the Aar River. The 3rd Battalion took the town of Eerde and cut the Veghel–St. Oedenrode highway, safeguarding the regiment’s rear. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion seized three bridges at Veghel.\nThe 501st secured all of its September 17 objectives in about three hours, capturing 50 prisoners in the process. In his haste to move toward Veghel, however, Kinnard was unable to transport all of his battalion’s equipment. He had left 46 men under the command of Captain W.S. Burd to bring this equipment, along with those paratroopers injured in the jump, forward at a slower pace. Burd’s detachment was attacked by a strong force of Germans and pushed back to a single building. When word of Burd’s plight reached Kinnard, Johnson allowed him to send a platoon to the rescue. The attempt failed, and Burd’s group was captured.\nThe other unit dropped out of its prescribed zone was the 1st Battalion of the 502nd Regiment. Nevertheless, that battalion, under Lt. Col. Patrick F. Cassidy, took St. Oedenrode, which commanded a major highway and a bridge over the Dommel. The 1st’s men killed 20 Germans and captured 58 in the process.\nMajor General Maxwell Taylor, commander of the 101st, wanted to capture rail and highway bridges over the Wilhelmina Canal near Best. Those bridges did not sit directly along the line of advance of the XXX Corps, but Taylor felt that their possession would strengthen his position and provide another route if the road through Son were cut.\nThe 502nd’s Company H drew the assignment of taking the bridges and soon ran into strong opposition. Its commander, Captain Robert E. Jones, dispatched a patrol toward the bridges. Led by Lieutenant Edward L. Wierzbowski, this group came within sight of the highway bridge but was forced to dig in, its strength reduced to only three officers and 15 men. Lieutenant Colonel Robert G. Cole, who earned the Medal of Honor in Normandy, commanded the 3rd Battalion, 502nd. He started out with the rest of his battalion to find Captain Jones and Company H at 1800 hours on the 17th, but his effort to link up was thwarted by darkness. The fight for Best would ultimately require a much larger force, including British tanks and at least two more battalions, to secure the area during the next two days. Private First Class Joe E. Mann would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on September 19–he died after being shot by a German sniper. General Taylor moved ahead with the 1st Battalion, 506th, south of Son, approaching the Wilhelmina Canal road bridge from the west. Just south of the town, below the Zonsche Forest, 88mm guns began shelling the Americans. The other two battalions of the 506th, commanded by Colonel Sink, came under fire from additional 88s.\nDon Burgett, a member of the 1st Battalion, remembered the vicious fight for Son. ‘We organized and we began to charge the guns,’ he recalled. ‘The only way we were going to survive was to knock out the 88s even though a lot of us were going to die trying to do it. As we were running toward them, they fired at us at point-blank range. We overran their positions. There were several 88s. They were sandbagged and dug in and used for anti-aircraft. A trooper from D Company got in close enough and fired a bazooka and knocked out one of the guns.’\nBoth groups from the 506th then moved toward the bridge. ‘We overran the 88s, took the German gunners prisoner, and someone said, ‘Let’s take the bridge,” continued Burgett. ‘We started to run toward the bridge. We were within yards of the bridge when the Germans blew it up. It went off with quite a force….We hit the ground. I rolled over on my back because everything got real quiet, and I saw the debris in the air. I remember seeing this tiny straw that was turning slowly, way up in the air, and as it hit its maximum trajectory and started to come down, it became larger and larger. About halfway down we realized the size of this thing. It was probably about 2 feet wide and 40 feet long. There was no place to run. When it hit the ground, the ground shook like jello.’\nWith the Son bridge in ruins, the effort to capture Eindhoven slowed. However, the XXX Corps halted that evening at Valkenswaard, six miles away. By the time the XXX Corps arrived at Eindhoven the next day, the town was in the hands of the 101st. As night fell on the 17th, the 101st controlled Veghel, St. Oedenrode and Son. Although the 502nd had encountered battle-toughened German troops around Best, the objective there was secondary. In a few hours, the 101st would have its stretch of Hell’s Highway completely open.\nAlmost from the beginning, jubilant Dutch civilians had welcomed the Allied paratroopers as liberators. Early on the morning of September 18, the 506th destroyed a pair of 88s and pushed into Eindhoven. While throngs of citizens welcomed them, the paratroopers disarmed a handful of Germans. As the townspeople erupted in celebration, one American officer remembered: ‘The reception was terrific. The air seemed to reek with hate for the Germans….’\nFinally, at 1700 hours that evening, the leading elements of the XXX Corps rumbled through Eindhoven virtually without stopping. At Son, Canadian engineers, who had been notified that the existing bridge had been destroyed, worked throughout the night to deploy a prefabricated Bailey bridge. At 0645 on the 19th, 33 hours behind schedule, the tanks of the XXX Corps rumbled over the Wilhelmina Canal.\n \nNot all members of the 101st arrived in Holland by parachute; many, including these men from the divisional headquarters company, landed via glider. (NATIONAL ARCHIVES)\nBy the morning of September 19, the XXX Corps had crossed the Willems Canal and the Aar River at Veghel and was moving into the 82nd Airborne’s zone. While the 82nd had been successful in achieving most of its goals, the Germans still held the bridge across the Waal at Nijmegen. It was captured with a herculean effort on the afternoon of the 20th, but the armored ‘cavalry’ did not cross the Waal until the 21st. Time was running out for the heroic British paratroopers at Arnhem.\nIn the 101st’s sector, the primary job became holding the narrow corridor of hope open against repeated enemy counterattacks. While Allied armor was advancing northward, it was vital to keep the road open to facilitate the flow of troops and supplies. The Germans, however, fought back viciously against the 101st’s defensive positions around Eindhoven, Son, St. Oedenrode and Veghel. General Taylor likened the action to the bushwhacking style of fighting between small garrisons of troops and Indians in the American West. The Germans would attack, cut the road and then be driven back by the troopers of the 101st.\nOn the 22nd, the Germans mounted a counterattack against Veghel supported by heavy artillery and aircraft. The attack was not beaten back until two days later. ‘It was a very depressing atmosphere listening to the civilians moan, shriek, sing hymns and say their prayers,’ wrote Daniel Kenyon Webster of the 506th’s Company E, remembering the rain of artillery. He and Private Don Wiseman dug a deep foxhole. ‘Wiseman and I sat in our corners and cursed,’ Webster continued. ‘Every time we heard a shell come over, we closed our eyes and put our heads between our legs. Every time the shells went off, we looked up and grinned at each other.’\nOn September 24, the Germans ravaged a British column on Hell’s Highway at Koevering. Burgett remembered: ‘The Germans brought up some 40mm cannons and they had some self-propelled guns, and they shot up the British who were lined up on the side of the road…brewing tea in those five-gallon tins, and the Germans just opened up on them. They killed over 300. ‘When we got down to Koevering, the trucks were still burning,’ continued Burgett. ‘We went into the attack immediately. I remember we killed two Germans in a haystack. Then we made an attack west across the road at a farmhouse. The farmhouse was set on fire. We went into the German side, and we drove them back.’\nAlthough it became apparent that Market-Garden was a strategic failure, the men of the 101st Airborne could say that they had done their part admirably. The northern flank of the Allied armies was extended 65 miles across two canals and the Maas and Waal rivers, while a considerable amount of Dutch territory had been freed from Nazi occupation. The division had killed many Germans and captured 3,511, while suffering 2,110 casualties itself.\nAlthough most of the men of the 101st expected to be pulled out of the line at the end of September, the division was placed under the control of the British XII Corps on the 28th and transferred north to the front line in an area known as the Island, a 5-kilometer strip of land between the Neder Rijn and the Waal. Due to heavy demands for manpower, the British were pressed for troops, and both the 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions found themselves in positions that resembled the trench lines of World War I. Occasionally, they experienced artillery duels between the Germans and the British and were involved in infantry clashes.\nOn the night of October 5, a platoon of the 506th’s Company E, supported by a detachment from Company F, mauled two companies of German SS troops attempting to infiltrate American lines in support of an attack by the 363rd Volksgrenadier Division. Captain (later Major) Richard Winters, Company E’s commander, led his 35 men brilliantly, demonstrating great bravery and coolness under fire.\nMoving along a road adjacent to a dike near the banks of the Neder Rijn, Winters shot a German who was only three yards away and then opened up on a mass of enemy troops. ‘The movements of the Germans seemed to be unreal to me,’ he reflected. ‘When they rose up, it seemed to be so slow. When they turned to look over their shoulders at me, it was in slow motion. When they started to raise their rifles to fire at me, it was in slow, slow motion. I emptied the first clip [eight rounds] and, still standing in the middle of the road, put in a second clip and, still shooting from the hip, emptied that clip into the mass.’\nWinters remembered that action as the ‘highlight of all E Company actions for the entire war, even better than D-Day, because it demonstrated Easy’s overall superiority in every phase of infantry tactics: patrol, defense, attack under a base of fire, withdrawal, and above all, superior marksmanship with rifles, machine gun and mortar fire.’\nThe 101st held its positions on the Island until late November, when it was withdrawn to Camp Mourmelon, outside the French village of Mourmelon-le-Grand. From the Market-Garden drop until its last troopers were relieved, the division had spent 72 days in combat zones. In the defensive fighting at the Island, it suffered 1,682 casualties.\nThe men of the 101st experienced combat for the first time on D-Day. They had fought gallantly as veterans in Holland. But their sternest test and their finest hour were yet to come, at the Belgian crossroads town of Bastogne.\nThis article was written by Michael Haskew and originally appeared in World War II‘s 2004 Special Collector’s Edition of issue of Band of Brothers.\nFor more great articles be sure to pick up your copy of World War II .\n\n"
