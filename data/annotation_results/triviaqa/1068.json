Our range includesbuffer board, inverter board, main board, power supply board and tv boards from top manufacturers like Samsung and Toshiba.\nTV boards are types of circuit boards; normally printed circuit boards (PCBs), that manage the functions of the television. Circuit boards are electrical systems that serve as an electrical hub, linking various conducting elements throughout the equipment. They typically utilize copper wires, which serve as conductive pathways, etched onto a piece of synthetic material. Each TV has a number of different boards, from a main to inverter board, which serve numerous electrical functions. Dozens of electronic devices use printed circuit boards to operate, from computer systems to cell phones. Before purchasing a TV board, customers ought to learn about what kinds of boards are in their Televisions, how to check numerous boards, and determine which board is malfunctioning. These steps can be done in the house or with the assistance of a professional. When buying a TV circuit board, be certain to get one that works with a certain brand name and design number. If the buyer bought a warranty when the initial tv was purchased, he or she may be able to get a replacement board at no expense. Check with the manufacturer or original place where the tv was purchased. Otherwise, buyers can acquire a brand-new or secondhand TV board for little expense. Whether buyers are preparing to replace a TV board themselves or working with somebody, it's a good idea to test a board initially. Buyers can generally open the back of the TV with a simple screwdriver and take a look at the various circuits and elements. Discover the one that might be malfunctioning and test it utilizing a multi-meter display screen.\nUse bookmarks. If you are continuously shopping online, typing the site URL in the web address line of your browser can be tedious and extremely time consuming. Next time try utilizing the favorites or bookmark feature. While you are sitting on a site you want to return back to: With AOL, just drag the heart shaped icon from the top of the browser window and drop it into the \"favorites\" folder with the heart on it. With Internet Explorer, click on the \"favorites\" folder, click on add. With Netscape Navigator, click on \"bookmarks\" and add bookmark. Save even more time by making sure to organize web sites in folders for optimum use. When purchasing online, it is important to know that some retailers prohibit return of items, often for a good reason.  Knowing the policy of your retailer will help to prevent any confusion later on.\n$21.18\nWinsor Newton , Cotman WaterColors , Color , Acrylic , Water Color , NEW , IVRY , PAYNES GRY , GRY , Gray\nHelpful Tips\nMerely ask if you're not exactly sure just what version number to gain or specifically just what you require. The majority of purchasing websites have an e-mail address, contact number or on-line conversation so you could consult with client service. If you notice something that you want within an auction website, be sure to perform some research concerning the vendor initially to make sure that you're not engaging in any fake financial transactions.

Mozilla was the original name for Netscape Navigator, ... Something else that bugged me, ... Macintosh Usenet Newsreaders Software at The Mac Orchard Macintosh Usenet Newsreaders Software at The Mac Orchard\nDiiva\nCurrent Version: 1.0.3b3\nDiiva is a specialized newsreader that works in conjunction with Diiva's $5.00/month image preview and categorization service. Simply speaking, Diiva is a proprietary client that works in conjunction with the company's proprietary servers to help Usenet picture junkies quickly preview and find the pictures they are looking for. Available only for Power Macs running Mac OS 8.0 and later, it's distributed as shareware and costs $35. Version 1.0.2 adds/changes the following:\nMuch improved stability -- numerous crashing bugs fixed.\nImproved compatibility with a wider range of news servers.\nAdded the ability to reset the group access counts.\nFixed incompatibility with aggressive transparent proxy servers.\nImproved error reporting.\nShareware; $20\nCurrent Version: 2.8.3 (December 16, 2009)\nFrom the Info-Mac abstract file: MacSOUP is an offline reader for news and mail (it can be used for news only, if you prefer Eudora or another email client for mail). It works either with a Unix shell account (in conjunction with uqwk), or with a TCP/IP connection (MacTCP or Open Transport). Features: fetches only article headers in a first pass; lets you select which articles you actually want to download; true references-based threading, with a graphical display of the thread tree; kill file (with regular expressions); and multiple mailboxes with mail filters.\nVersion 2.8.3 - the first release in over two (!) years - makes the following changes/enhancements:\nWorked around a possible crash on startup with certain kinds of Address Book corruption.\nWith very large Address Books, typing in the address fields of an email editor window was very sluggish.\nThe Services menu now works in Snow Leopard.\nMacSOUP's scripting dictionary can be opened again with the AppleScript editor in Leopard.\nMinor fixes.\nUser Reviews\n\"MacSOUP is a remarkably useful and easy-to-use off-line mail reader. It combines news and e-mail, has an intuitive interface and a very good address book, and is one of the few Mac programs to work with UQWK, so you don't need TCP - a shell connection will work. MacSOUP can be configured so it is not something you even have to think about. The new version, 2.1, will work with TCP connections as well as UQWK mail packets, but requires Internet Config.\"\n—David Zatz\n\"MacSOUP, shareware at $20, is simply the best off-line news and mail program available for [the] Mac. It allows me to use [an off-line connection] with a Waffle Bulletin Board, as well as my regular PPP connection. Features are: easy to subscribe/unsubscribe to newsgroups, good kill files, multiple mail boxes, easy to use reply and followup commands, multiple configurations for different servers, accounts etc.,...need I go on?\"\n—Chris Smith\n\"I use MacSOUP regularly as my news client application of choice. By retrieving the entire text of subscribed newsgroups in batch mode, the user can spend as much time offline in examining the content. The status of retrieval is shown in in a small window with a progress bar. After MacSOUP completes the retrieval of the textual data, the user can be notified via a system beep. Alternatively, an AppleScript can be initiated (such as one to disconnect a PPP session).\n\"While reading a news article, you are able to see a branching graphical representation of the current message thread (with symbolic representation of whether a given posting has been read or not). While examining the graphical thread, moving the cursor over a message yields the name of the author. Finally, a fairly flexible kill file option is included.\n\"The one area where MacSOUP could stand improvement is in its inability to UUdecode binaries (either single or multiple segment). At least one other news client, Nuntius, has this capability.\"\n—Mike Oetting\n\"MacSOUP is great.  I don't waste online time, and its email with newsgroup reader package is the best.  MacSOUP also has an article thread tree, which helps you keep track of a topic.  This is a must-use program for the beginner Net user.\"\n—Toby Kels\n\"I have been using MacSOUP for about 3 years now, first on dial-up and now with a permanent Internet connection. Even though I don't \"need\" an offline reader anymore, MacSOUP still does an amazing job; the killfile facility is as flexible as that on complex UNIX news clients, but remains very easy to use. Being able to fetch all articles from some groups and only headers from others (e.g., binary groups) makes browsing fast and comfortable. And with all the e-mail viruses these days, there's another reason to use a program which does NOT support message attachments.\"\n—Graham Reed\n\"MacSOUP is rather lovely, especially the threading for offline news reading. Flaws: it insists on using Internet Config, which makes it difficult at best to have two different people (with different email addresses) to use it for news and mail reading, which is a shame. There's also no 'take address into addressbook' that I could find....\"\n—Stuart Langridge\n\"I use this on an old Performa 200 (Classic II) and it runs very quickly. The layout of the windows etc. is fine on the small screen and it looks good even in monochrome. This is an ideal newsreader if you are a bit short on processor horsepower. The graphical thread indicator is excellent. The only minus points are that it doesn't handle attachments very well and it can't decode binaries automatically. The ability to customise mail headings is a plus. Recommended!\"\n—Paul Foster\n\"The best Shareware app I've ever used - in fact the only one I have paid for. Brilliant. I even use if my Email now as well, it does lack in attachment support, but I set the message limit to download and use Eudora then. Attachment support is promised for the next release. It's a breeze to send messages to multiple NG's or Email and post replies at the same time. Get it NOW.\"\n—Andy Hewitt\n\"Still the only program with an easily-navigable two-dimensional thread overview and the ability to fast-read tagged messages only -- like \"trn\" on Unix. Downside: No Carbon version, no ability to export a full .newsrc file.\"\n—Matthias Urlichs\nOpen source; $0\nFinal Version: 1.7.13 (April 27, 2006) / 1.2.1 (December 3, 2002)\nMozilla was the original name for Netscape Navigator, back when it was first being developed in 1994 by Marc Andreesen and his friends from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA - the people who developed Mosaic, the world's first graphical web browser). The name was supposed to imply a supercharged, \"Godzilla\" version of Mosaic; Mozilla was forced to change its name to Netscape when the people at NCSA threatened to sue over trademark infringement. Behind the scenes, though, Netscape Navigator and Communicator have always been known as Mozilla; type \"about:mozilla\" into the \"Location\" field of any version of those browsers and you'll see evidence of that.\nIn the early 21st century, with the \"Mosaic\"-inspired name no longer an issue, Mozilla became the name of the open source project upon which the Netscape series of browsers was based. Continuously developed by programmers around the world rather than by just a handful at a large corporation, it changed constantly, and improved all the time.\nToday, however, Mozilla is no longer under development, at least under the \"Mozilla\" moniker. The primary components of Mozilla - its web browser and email/Usenet client - were broken off into separate, optimized development efforts, known respectively as Firefox and Thunderbird . The combined application suite has, as of early 2006, been reincarnated as SeaMonkey , which I will be adding to the Orchard soon.\nNonetheless, I include Mozilla here for historic purposes, since people will still find it useful and functional for some time, and it represents one of the only opportunities for users of \"Classic\" Mac OS to access a more modern browser that is largely compatible with today's more advanced web standards.\nWhile Mozilla 1.7.13 was a minor update to Mozilla 1.7 that added some security and stability fixes , version 1.7 made a huge number of feature and performance enhancements. The online release notes have the whole picture.\nMozilla is fast (once it's loaded, which can still take a while) at rendering web pages. Mozilla is a breath of fresh air, and while the interface elements seem a little slow compared to other browsers, pages render remarkably quickly. This latest release is more than worthy of your daily use. Two of my many criteria for determining a browser's usefulness are: 1) how long I keep it open for browsing before quitting out in frustration; and 2) how long it keeps itself open before crashing. Mozilla wins on both fronts. Download it and try it for yourself; I suspect you'll be pleasantly surprised.\nFYI: If you use OS X and like Mozilla - but don't like the way it looks - you should proceed, posthaste, to download the Pinstripe Theme for Mozilla , which lets the browser breathe through a beautiful Aqua interface, just like all of your favorite OS X apps. Mozilla's just not complete without it.\nMozilla 1.7 requires a Mac OS X later to run (version 1.2.1 was the last \"official\" release for OS 9, although the Web and Mail Communicator Project has a modified, unofficial release of version 1.3.1 available for OS 9 ), and it comes with optionally-installable news, email, and IRC (yes, IRC; Mozilla includes an incomplete IRC client called \"Chatzilla\" rather than AOL Instant Messenger) components. The mail and news clients are surprisingly well thought-out and pleasant to use, although I will probably always maintain that it is better to use separate, dedicated email and newsreading software rather than taking a \"swiss army knife\" approach; the separate tools are still superior at what they do. (Personal note: this is why I actually use Firefox for my regular browsing rather than the combined Mozilla suite...for email, I use Eudora.)\nUser Reviews\n\"I used to be a big Netscape fan until version 6. Mac Orchard reviewed NS6 correctly - big and clunky! While IE5 will probably remain my default browser, I am highly impressed with Mozilla. I am a web designer and need to see my pages in all the various browsers. Many times when I would attempt to view a page in NS6, it would quit even before it opened! Finally Mozilla will end that frustration for me.\"\n—Erin Bird\nto the \"nightly build\" FTP site for the latest unofficial release.\nVersion 1.8 beta 1 is also available for Mac OS X (Carbon), making many enhancements; however, it was announced in March 2005 that this version will not see a final release, as the Mozilla organization instead focuses its efforts on the development of the independent Firefox and Thinderbird programs. The SeaMonkey project is Mozilla's heir apparent. See the online release notes for more details.\nMulti-Threaded NewsWatcher\nFreeware\nCurrent Version: 3.1 / 3.4 / 3.5.2 (August 28, 2006)\nSince John Norstad releases the source code to the free NewsWatcher program for people to change, there are several variants of the program that add many features. MT-NewsWatcher is a multi-threaded version of NewsWatcher (hence the name) that brings a new level of usability to the NewsWatcher series. Multithreading has almost become a necessity in these days of Usenet overload, and the version 3.x series further enhances MT-NW's implementation, with an intuitive interface and smooth operation that will get you reading news faster than just about any other newsreader. Yes, it still has speech recognition capabilities, but a host of new features in version 3.x are, perhaps, of far more interest to most users. A few highlights include:\nRead news on multiple servers at the same time.\nSet up several personalities for posting, with different reply addresses, headers and signatures.\nView images inline, right in the article window! Non-image binaries show up as file icons.\nRead and post articles in different languages, like Japanese and Chinese.\nPost binaries to newsgroups.\nIndex the contents of articles that you read, so that you can search them later.\nConfigure per-group preferences for list format, character sets etc.\nReal-time pattern filtering in newsgroup, subject, and article windows.\nNewsgroup FAQ retrieval.\nMany other new features, and feature enhancements.\nVersion 3.1 (the latest \"Classic\" version) has some new features, and a lot of bug fixes. New features include:\nProgressive movie (QuickTime, MPEG etc) display, and MP3 playing\nMore image formats supported (PNG and other QuickTime image formats)\nOption to use a more accurate way of counting the number of articles available in a group\nMore message posting options\nSupport for UTF-7 and UTF-8\nSOCKS 4 support (via the Internet Control Panel).\nVersion 3.4 (the latest Mac OS 9 version, which is not considered fully supported by the author) features the following changes:\nJunk filtering - MT-NW now has an adaptive junk filter that makes it much easier to filter spam out of your newsgroups.\nInline spell checking - The native Cocoa spell checker is used to do spell checking as you type in message windows, complete with red underline.\nEmail address auto-complete - The system Address Book is used to auto-complete email addresses as you type them in recipient fields.\nBetter error reporting when extracting binaries - When batch-extracting binaries, extraction errors now go into a log window to avoid interrupting the extraction with dialogs.\nAuto-extracting of downloaded files - You can set preferences so that \"safe\" files that you download are automatically opened.\nVersion 3.5.2 (the latest Mac OS X version) is a must-have upgrade, bringing Universal Binary support for both PowerPC- and Intel-based Macs. Improvements include:\nSecure News - Added support for news over SSL (snews), configurable via the server settings in the News Servers dialog.\nSecure Mail - Added support for SMTP authentication, and SMTP over TLS and SSL, configurable via the Mail Server tab in the Personalities dialog.\nPasswords Stored in Keychain - MT-NW can now store news and mail passwords in your Keychain, and not in its preferences file.\nSearch Integration - The context menus in article and message windows now have items to search in Google, look up a word in Dictionary, and search using Spotlight (on Tiger). Spelling-related items are now also available in message window context menus.\nMore reliable binary extraction - This version contains fixes for several bugs relating to binary extraction. Extraced binaries will no longer produced corrupted files, and the process will use less memory.\nAdded the ability to create filters via AppleScript.\nRemoved the ability to base a personality on an Internet Config profile, since IC is deprecated in the OS.\nThe \"User agent\" header no longer contains \"Intel\" on PowerPC machines.\nBuild PPC with gcc 3.3 so that it's compatible with pre-10.3.9 systems.\nFixed the \"Print\" menu item.\nAuthentication via GSS (Kerberos) now works again.\nFixed SOCKS connection error on Intel.\nFixed a bug that caused extracted binaries to be corrupted sometimes.\nFixed a bug that caused files created by cancelled binary extraction tasks to not be deletable.\nImproved error reporting when extracting binaries.\nYou can now Copy from the binary extraction Log window\nFixed memory leaks when extracting binaries.\nNow use long filenames when dragging msgs from subject window to Finder.\nJPEG images now display millions of colors, which fixes color banding issues.\nFixed some issues enabling menu items on the \"Shared Newsrc\" submenu.\nFixed a bug that caused some window positions to be restored incorrectly on Intel (this was most apparent with the Log window, and I believe was responsible for a nasty hang when extracting binaries on Intel machines).\nFixed an issue that caused MT-NW to complain that some URL helpers (like Fetch) are too old to use.\nMT-NewsWatcher is one of the reasons the Macintosh remains the preferred platform for serious Usenet junkies. There's little else that compares with it.\nUser Reviews\n\"Multi-Threaded NewsWatcher . . . without doubt positions itself as the premier Usenet newsreader available today for the Macintosh.  Simon Fraser has done an unbelievable job supporting this excellent product, and get this - it's free!  It is easily the most-used piece of software I have on my Mac.\n\"As far as bug fixes are concerned, every bug report I have sent to Simon has either resulted in a fix or has been acknowledged.  Three new releases this year is pretty good going!  I work for a software development company, so I can appreciate the response Simon is providing.\nImproved typing performance by not flushing the graphics port on every caret blink.\nGreyscale images now display correctly.\nFixed authentication issues when not saving the password in Keychain.\nFixed the display of the help images on Intel machines.\nFixed a hang on 10.5 when extracting binaries on showing a \"Choose folder\" dialog (and some other related hangs).\nFixed a hang on 10.5 after posting a message (deadlock when destroying the spell checker object).\nFixed a bug that could cause security failure dialogs to not be displayed on connection. (b2)\nFixed a bug introduced in 3.5.3b1 that caused sending mail to never complete. (b2)\nNo longer show error message when dragging and dropping in subject windows. (b2)\nMade uudecoding more robust to crud inserted into articles by news feed providers. (b2)\nFixed the ability to drag an inline image to the Finder without selecting it (option key saves a file, rather than a clipping). (b2)\nMoved the MT-NewsWatcher.rsrc file to the English.lproj directory in the package to make localization easier. (b2)\nFixed a crash closing subject windows after rebuilding the full groups list. (b3)\nFix an issue where Extract Binaries would sometimes stall after choosing a destination folder. (b3)\nClear the news server authentication password field when switching between news servers. (b3)\nNemo\nShareware; €14.99\nCurrent Version: 0.2.9 (July 14, 2009)\nNemo is Usenet newsreader made for Mac OS X that is designed to look and behave like an Apple application. It uses the most recent Mac OS X technologies like WebKit and Spotlight .\nNemo uses WebKit in order to render messages on screen. This means that if you know a little bit of CSS you can create your own messages styles or threads map styles easily and share them with other users like in Adium or Colloquy. You can also navigate the Internet with the simple and complete integrated browser; you can use your bookmarks from your favorite browser with an auto-update sync feature.\nFeatures include:\nFreeware\nCurrent Version: 9.0.0.5 (December 11, 2007)\nPlease note: As of February, 2008, Netscape will once again be discontinued. This time, however, it will be discontinued for all platforms, and support for all versions, past and present, will be discontinued as well. See Tom Drapeau's blog post for more information.\nOnce the universal choice for browsing the web, Netscape's presence today has been marginalized by many other browsers, largely due to the stagnant 4.x series that introduced little innovation, and to the 6.x series, which merely showed amateurish promise.\nNetscape 9 is a bundled Web browser / authoring environment / email / newsreader / instant messenger offering based upon the Mozilla project's browser and renderer work.\nThe primary components of Netscape and Mozilla - both the web browser and email/Usenet client - were broken off into separate, optimized development efforts, known respectively as Firefox and Thunderbird . The combined application suite has, as of early 2006, been reincarnated as SeaMonkey , which I will be adding to the Orchard soon.\nIn its older (7.x) incarnations, Netscape represents one of the few remaining opportunities for users of \"Classic\" Mac OS to access a more modern browser that is largely compatible with today's more advanced web standards. Version 7.02 was the final release for \"Classic\" Mac OS, and it remains available, below.\nVersion 9 is available for Mac OS X 10.2 and later, represents the first new release of Netscape for the Mac in over three years. It's a universal binary, and it offers the following:\nVisual Refresh - Netscape Navigator 9's theme has been updated to save screen-space and leave more room for the websites you visit.\nURL Correction - Navigator 9 will automatically correct common typos in URLs. For example, if you accidentally type googlecom, Navigator will fix it be to google.com. The browser will watch for nearly 30 different types of common mistakes and correct them for you (asking you to confirm, if you choose to enable confirmation).\nNews Menu and Sidebar - The latest news is built right into the browser, under the News menu. Provided by Netscape.com, you can customize the menu to only contain the news sections you want to monitor. You can also open the News sidebar to always keep an eye on what's happening.\nLink Pad - The Link Pad is a new sidebar feature that allows you to save links/URLs that you want to visit later without cluttering your bookmarks. Just drag a link over the Link Pad status bar icon and drop it to save it in the Link Pad. By default, clicking on an item in the Link Pad will open it in the browser and remove it from the list, saving you the step of deleting it.\nNews Tracker - The Netscape Tracker sidebar lets you monitor breaking news as it happens, via Netscape.com.\nIn-browser voting - Share your opinions with the world! The icons in the Navigator address bar let you share interesting stories you find and vote on stories shared by others.\nExtension Compatibility - Navigator 9 shares an architecture with the latest Mozilla technologies; as such, Navigator 9 will let you install extensions that are compatible with Firefox 2.\nSidebar Mini Browser - You've always been able to have bookmarks open in the sidebar, but we've improved this functionality and extended it to all links, not just bookmarks. Additionally, we've added a navigation toolbar to the sidebar for even easier split-screened browsing. Just right-click on a link and select \"Open Link in Sidebar\" to get started!\nRestart Netcape - A smalll but oft-requested feature: you can now restart Navigator (and keep your current tabs intact) by selecting \"Restart Navigator\" from the File menu.\nResizeable Textarea - Drag the bottom-right corners of text fields in forms to add more typing space.\nTab History - Opening a link in a new tab will give the new tab the same history as the source tab for a more seamless tabbed browsing experience.\nOPML Support - Netscape Navigator supports importing and exporting your bookmarks in OPML, a popular format for sharing lists of newsfeeds.\nThrobber - By popular demand, the Netscape 7-style throbber is back. Click on it any time to visit Netscape.com.\nCombined Stop/Reload button - To save space in your toolbar, we've combined the stop and reload buttons. Because you never need both at the same time, the toolbar will only show the relevant half of the pair.\nFriends' Activity Sidebar - If you are a member at Netscape.com, you can keep tabs on what your friends find interesting. This sidebar lets you view your friends latest votes, comments, and story submissions.\nSitemail Notification - This icon will sport an exclamation point when you have new Netscape.com sitemail messages waiting for you.\nSince Navigator 9 is based on the newest Mozilla technologies, there are additional features in Navigator 9 that were not available in Netscape Browser 8.x. You can read about those new features in these release notes from Mozilla .\nVersion 9.0.0.5 adds/changes the following:\nThese security fixes included in Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.11 have been included in Netscape Navigator 9.0.0.5.\nNetscape 9 is as fast at loading and viewing/navigating pages than just about any browser available for the Mac - even though the interface elements are somewhat clunkier. Even so, Netscape Communicator 4 (updated on 8/20/2002 to version 4.8 ) is still available (see below) for those who might prefer its quirks.\nI have chosen not to review the non-browser components of this release, but I generally recommend people use separate, dedicated email and newsreading software (although the email component has gotten rave reviews in many publications). The Swiss army knife approach just doesn't cut it for me (pun very much intended) when it's not a matter of my pockets feeling bulky.\nUser Reviews\n\"Impressive, this new Netscape version (7.0). I was still using 4.76, seeing that version 6 was not well reviewed. This new version draws fast and does not redraw (so far). I like the look and feel of it. After only about an hour with it, I can say I will adopt it. I'm using a PowerBook G3 (Firewire) with OS 9.1 and 384MB of memory. Consider this browser.\"\n—Alain Thibault\nFreeware\nCurrent Version: 10.0 (September 2, 2009)\nOpera, the browser that has been a favorite of PC users for years, has finally arrived on the Macintosh in recent years. Similar in scope to Mozilla , Opera includes not just a web browser, but an email client and Usenet newsreader as well. Both of these are quite capable, and worth a look if you prefer an all-in-one application to suit the bulk of your Internet communication needs.\nVersion 10.0 makes the following enhancements from version 9.64:\nAuto update - Opera now includes the ability to update itself automatically when new releases become available. By default, Opera will notify the user about available updates. Users can specify that snapshot build releases of Opera should be downloaded by enabling \"Download All Snapshots\" in opera:config. Users can also choose not to check for updates or to automatically install updates by going to Tools > Preferences > Advanced > Security and changing the \"Opera update level\" (select box) to the: \"Automatically install updates\" setting.\nCrashlogging tool - An integrated user interface for built-in crash reporting has been added to Opera. This feature automatically appears when Opera has suffered a crash and enables a user to easily report the event directly back to Opera.\nInline spell checker - Spelling errors are now indicated as you type via a dotted red underline in all places where you can input text: form fields, Opera Mail compose windows, Notes, Chat, etc. Only single-line text fields do not check spelling automatically. The spelling checker can be enabled/disabled from the context menu (right-click a text field to open this menu). The context menu also includes spelling suggestions, the ability to change dictionary languages, and the ability to select additional dictionaries for automatic download and installation. Opera uses the Hunspell dictionary format, and a US English dictionary is included by default.\nOpera Presto 2.2 rendering engine - The Opera Presto rendering engine has been updated to version 2.2 further enhancing its reputation for stability and security.\nOpera Turbo - This new Opera feature increases your internet bandwidth speed on slow connections using data and image compression technologies. Opera Turbo uses Opera proxy servers to compress the traffic before it reaches the Opera browser on the client computer.\nPretty-printing of unstyled XML - Opera 10 incorporates \"pretty-print XML\", which is now the default styling for unstyled XML and uses the unstyledxml.css style sheet in the Styles sub-directory of the Opera installation directory.\nSkin elements - New skin elements crafted by our acclaimed Web designer Jon Hicks have been applied to the Opera 10 user interface.\nVisual tabs - The Opera 10 Tab Bar can be used to show all open tabs as thumbnails.\nAcid3 test = Opera 10 scores 100/100, pixel perfect on the Acid3 compliance test.\nOpera Dragonfly - Additions to Opera Dragonfly developer tools include HTTP header inspection, DOM editing, and automatic selection of the current tab.\nOpera Mail - Delete After X Days - POP-only - Delete after X days automatically removes messages from POP servers after the specified number of days, which is particularly useful for users who have limited server space. This option can be enabled for POP accounts on the Incoming tab of the account settings dialog by checking \"Remove from server after #days\" (7 days by default). It is also possible to specify that only read messages and/or only fully downloaded messages should be removed. Warning: Disabling the latter option is dangerous for those that use low-bandwidth mode, as messages that are not completely downloaded will be removed from the server, making it impossible to retrieve the complete message.\nOpera Mail - Rich Text Message Composition - HTML authoring\nRegular expression engine - Opera 10 has an improved and faster regular expression engine that uses a stack-based bytecode instruction set. This type of instruction set is based around a stack of values, where most instructions \"pop\" input operands from the value stack, process them, and \"push\" the result back onto the value stack. Some instructions simply push values onto the value stack, and others rearrange the values on the stack. This results in compact bytecode programs with code that is easily generated. It is a typical backtracking regular expression engine, but does some tricks to avoid redundant backtracking. These usually avoid the severe performance issues a backtracking regular expression engine can have on specific regular expressions.\nSpeed Dial configuration options - You can now easily configure how many speed dials will fit comfortably on your Opera desktop. Click \"Configure Speed Dial\" in the lower-right corner of the Speed Dial page to open the configuration dialog box.\nSupport for the CSS3 color:transparent value has been improved.\nFull RGBA and HSLA opacity support is now included for an easier way to make Web page features transparent. This is accomplished by the addition of a fourth argument to HSL and RGB, namely alpha transparency and results in RGBA and HSLA values. See this Opera reference.\nSupport has been added for the CSS Selectors API. This feature makes the selection of DOM elements a lot simpler. It includes partial support for namespace resolver features which allow you to work with mixed namespace documents and select elements based on their namespace; see this Opera reference.\nCSS files must now be served with the correct MIME type (\"text/css\") in Strict mode, or they will be ignored.\nHTML 5 algorithms have been implemented for detecting charsets in HTML.\nHTML 5 end-tag and start-tag parsing, whitespace parsing, and DOCTYPE parsing have been added.\nHTML 5 <canvas> elements can now export images to the JPEG format.\nHTML 5 <canvas> transforms are applied when building a path, not when painting it.\nFPS (Frames Per Second) support: Opera enables you to manipulate the speed (frames per second) of your SVG animations using JavaScript by supporting the SVGElement.currentFps and SVGElement.targetFps properties. These properties respectively read and control SVG frames per second; see this Opera reference.\nSVG fonts in HTML support: Use SVG font files to style your text using CSS (in both HTML and SVG files); see this Opera reference.\nWeb fonts - font specification (@font-face CSS at-rules) with the font-family descriptor\nWeb fonts - src descriptor with local and remote\nWeb fonts - TrueType (TTF)\nWeb fonts - OpenType (OTF)\nWeb fonts - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) font support\nThe online release notes have much more detail about these new features. I would daresay that, as of the 9.0 release, Opera has become a browser that is worthy of attention on the Mac once and for all. It's quite stable, capable and customizable, and it renders pages very well - on a par with Safari and Firefox. Its breakthrough feature remains its ability to magnify and reduce pages (graphics and all) to just about any size of your choice, which is a real boon for those with disabilities. Its RSS reader is much more thoroughly developed than that in Safari and Firefox as well. Be sure to come back here again for more thorough review soon.\nOpera is entirely free, eschewing the built-in advertising that was once its hallmark. Competition in the browser space is a good thing for Mac users. Let's hope that Opera can shake up the Mac browser world in a big way.\nUser Reviews\n[9.0.1] \"I've been using Opera 9.01 for just over an hour and I'm already certain there won't be a second hour of testing. In this short space of time I've found the delete button in the download prefs does nothing (I wanted to delete the application/zip prefs to force Opera to ask for new settings), when I set zip files to be opened after downloading, nothing happens, and Opera corrupted all the zip archives I was downloading from a sound clip site. Camino downloaded them fine. Something else that bugged me, yet wasn't an actual bug - when I went Opera->About Opera to get double-check the program version before posting this review, Opera opened the about page IN PLACE of the MacOrchard submit a review page :-( Not good behavior. Opera also touts itself as the fastest browser ever - not in my testing! Camino and even Shiira are faster loading pages. These bugs and annoyances (and this is just what I've encountered in an hour... I wonder what I'd find if I stuck with Opera longer?) are nothing compared to how un-maclike the UI is. If only because Opera uses non-standard and un-maclike UI elements and practises, I will not continue using this program.\"\n—Jamie Kahn Genet, August 12, 2006\nthe Mac OS X 10.3+ (Carbon / Universal) version.\nVersion 10.10 beta 1 (Carbon / Universal, for Mac OS X - October 15, 2009) is available, introducing support for Opera Unite , which allows you to download and run Web applications and to share content with others in a quick and easy way.\nPictureSnooper\nShareware; $40-$45\nCurrent Version: X 1.2 (December 18, 2003) / PE 1.1b (June 12, 2006) / PE 1.2 (March 30, 2010)\nFrom the Info-Mac abstract file: PictureSnooper is an application that searches Usenet newsgroups for binary files, while you are having dinner, at the movies, or even sleeping. These binary files are usually pictures (and sometimes executables and HTML files). After finding a binary file, PictureSnooper downloads the file, decodes that file, and saves that file to the directory of your choice for later viewing.\nPictureSnooper X version 1.2 (Carbon, for Mac OS 8.5 - Mac OS X) made the the following changes:\nImproved Performance On Message Parsing\nFixed An Issue With Pre-G4 Processors\nVarious Bug Fixes\nPictureSnooper PE version 1.1b added \"Universal Binary\" support for native performance on both PowerPC- and Intel-based Macs running Mac OS X 10.4.\nPictureSnooper PE version 1.2 - the first new version in almost four (!) years - adds support for Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6.\nPictureSnooperX and PictureSnooperPE are shareware, $40 and $45, respectively. (Upgrades from previous versions are $5.)\nUser Reviews\nCommercial; $39.95\nCurrent Version: 1.1.2 (March 9, 2010)\nPostbox is an interesting commercial email client and Usenet newsreader based on the email technology that underlies Thunderbird . However, it adds a refined user interface and provides advanced message analysis and cataloging functions that make it easier to search and retrieve information on demand. It also includes some social networking features, such as direct integration with Twitter, FriendFeed, Facebook, and Flickr.\nVersion 1.1.2 introduces the following enhancements over the previous release (1.1.1):\nSupport for Things (version 1.2.11)\nSupport for OmniFocus (version 1.7.5)\nSupport for the IMAP COMPRESS extension which makes accessing Gmail faster\nTopics are now exposed via AppleScript\nMigration from Mail.app will now import all of the folders located under \"On My Mac\"\nFixed an issue where certain calendar invites from Exchange were not showing up as attachments\nFixed an issue where the signature was not being placed in the correct place when forwarding\nFixed an issue where sending to a mailing list could fail\nFixed an issue where indented text wasn't displayed properly\nImproved automatic detection of account settings for various ISPs\nIncorporated Mozilla Firefox security updates through version 3.5.8.\nUser Reviews\nShareware; see text\nCurrent Version: 1.8.4 (May 31, 2009)\nThoth is another world-class newsreader from Brian Clark, author of the awesome-but-discontinued YA-NewsWatcher newsreader. Thoth has all the features that made YA-NW so great, including an attractive user interface, power-user preferences, automatic FAQ retrieval, queued article and header downloads, quoted text coloring, reference-based article threading (with a handy view of the thread available while you're reading its posts), multi-threaded connection to the news server (up to 4 connections), sophisticated filtering with regex support, comprehensive multiple character set support, binary posting and built-in binary viewing, finely integrated support for multiple news servers (even simultaneously) - and, like YA-NW, hundreds of other small features too numerous to mention here. Thoth is an astounding piece of work.\nIf Thoth has not been registered then it will stop working 30 days from when it was first installed. There's also a limit of 50 queued transfers or inline attachments displayed per session until Thoth has been registered. Alerts reminding you that Thoth is shareware will be shown at startup until the program has been registered and you have entered your registration key. These are the only differences between registered and unregistered copies of Thoth. The nag alert, 30 day expiration, and queued transfer/inline image per session limit serve as incentives to register Thoth without preventing the program from being fully evaluated and all its features fully tested prior to registration. Version 1.8 adds/changes the following from version 1.7.2 (the previous public release):\nThe OS X only version of Thoth now offers spelling checking for message windows. In message windows misspelled words can optionally be displayed in a distinct color and underlined (similar to URL styling, and enabled or disabled the same way in the \"Fonts and Styles\" pane of Preferences) to make them more obvious. When a single misspelled word is selected and there are guesses available, the contextual menu will have a submenu listing the guesses to paste in to correct the spelling. The Messages pane of the Preferences and Newsgroup Settings dialogs now allow you to set the default spelling check language for message windows. That setting, along with the one to display misspelled text in a distinct color and underlined, can also be adjusted for individual open message windows via the \"Message Options\" dialog opened via the appropriate toolbar button.\nAdded support for SMTP authentication (PLAIN and CRAM-MD5 methods). Note that for mail sending to work, you probably must specify a valid email address for your email address (which you'd want to do for a private email message anyway) and not one that ends in .invalid or which is otherwise invalid or nonexistent. Note that mac.com will reject email if the From address isn't your mac.com email address. Other SMTP servers may impose comparable rules.\nTried to work around an OS X bug with drawing checkmark and other special system symbols on non-Roman systems.\nFixed a problem with the column formatting of the thread view in article list windows.\nAdded detection and support for JPEG2000 image files (viewable only under OS X with QuickTime 6). JPEG2000 images may not display correctly due to possible problems with non-standards compliance by the encoding application or QuickTime, since JPEG2000 is a new and evolving standard.\nThe View menu Resort command can now be used with the Queued Transfers List to re-sort items alphabetically by the name of the article being downloaded or posted. Holding down the shift key resorts only the selected items. Holding down the option key causes reverse order sorting. This command was also added to the contextual menu for the Queued Transfers List window.\nWhen using the option to add new binaries to extract to the top of the Queued Transfers list (by holding down the shift key), the items are now added in such a way that their order in the article list window is maintained. Previously, since each item in succession was added to the then-top of the list, the newly added items would appear in the reverse order of how they were shown in the article list window.\nFixed a problem with background window updates when editing a filter from the \"Matching Filters\" window.\nAdded \"Show Post Info\" command to Special menu for article list windows to display a text window with header information for the selected posts. This is similar to the Export command, except the headers are shown in a text window as they would appear in the original posts, in a more human readable form that the tab-delimited table of data produced by the Export command. The main keyboard short for this new command is 'h.' This command was also added to the contextual menu for article list windows.\nModified the 'm' shortcut key to also work in locked size image windows to change the magnification so that the image is as large as possible (while not zooming the window larger as is done with non-locked windows).\nAdded Date and Newsgroups headers to the post information text (optionally) saved with extracted binaries.\nChanged how decoder and queued transfer error sounds are played to try to work around an OS bug that sometimes causes crashes when playing the sounds.\nFixed a bug that erroneously caused filter actions to be done for article list windows opened from a search window (they should only be done for article list windows opened from a subscribed group list window).\nIt is now possible to set a long \"Expire Active Connections After\" value to deal with news servers that abruptly close connections that have been open and active a long time.\nIf the connection to the news server is lost while downloading a binary attachment, an attempt to try again with a new connection is now done automatically.\nAfter clicking on the Reset button in the Statistics pane of the \"News Server Settings\" dialog, the displayed start date wasn't updated to reflect the change. Fixed.\nShift-clicking in an image window now works like Ptah to create a selection rectangle that can then be used to change the magnification of the image to make the rectangle fill the window, etc. Previously the change in magnification would happen immediately as soon as the shift-click and drag was completed.\nAdded a work-around for the changed behavior of the Drag Manager in OS X 10.3 that causes TrackDrag to block when the mouse is not moved, which interfered with dragging something to the top of bottom of a view and having the view autoscroll unless the mouse was constantly wiggled.\nModified how Date headers are parsed to handle the most common forms of non-RFC compliance. When filtering on dates it is now possible to specify a filter that just matches such bad dates without also specifying that the post be older or newer than a specified number of days. With these changes it's still possible to filter on bad dates (most often found in posts by spammers) while still showing a date (instead of a question mark) in article list windows.\nRenamed \"matches the pattern\" style live filtering and group Find searches to \"starts with the pattern\" to more clearly indicate what it is supposed to do, and added the similar \"contains the pattern\" style live filtering and Find searches. Also, formerly if a newsgroup didn't match the pattern but did include the pattern in literal form as part of its name, that group would count as a match (i.e. if the pattern was \"a.b\" then both \"aaa.bbb.ccc\" and \"xxa.bbb.ccc\" would match, as the first matches the pattern, and the second name contains it as part of its name). This is no longer the case, since it was inconsistent and would lead to unwanted matches, and because the \"contains the string\" option is available when this type of matching is desired.\nFixed a problem in how sorting reply threads by subject was performed and also ensured than in non-threaded mode replies will follow non-replies with the same subject.\nWhen editing multiple selected filters in the filters list window, if the expiration settings for a filter are changed, the filter will now also be unexpired if it was previously expired by removing the leading '•' character from the filter group name. This means it's now easy to batch unexpirations of filters (if the option to keep expired filters is enabled, and you find that you wish to again use some expired filters. When editing a single expired filter, it is still necessary to manually change the filter group name to remove the leading '•' to unexpire the filter.\nModified scrollwheel support. Now holding down the control key while scrolling will accelerate scrolling by a factor of 4 (previously the option key was used for scrollwheel acceleration). Holding down the option key while using the scrollwheel now acts the same as holding down the option key while clicking in the scrollbar arrow buttons, typically causing page by page scrolling.\nAdded a graphical tree display to the thread list in article windows (when reference threading is enabled). This works with the indenting to help show the relationship of the various posts in the thread, as does the preexisting feature of bolding the parent and child posts for the currently displayed thread. Also, since a single-click is always used to choose a new post from the thread list, which is always drawn selected in the list, the asterisk that was formerly used to indicate the current post in the list is no longer drawn. Finally, when the graphical thread tree is drawn, any gaps in the thread caused by a missing parent post are indicated by a gap with an x in the tree's horizontal limb rather than prefacing the author's name with an ellipsis.\nWorked around a bug in OS X 10.4 which caused incorrect word boundary finding, causing words with apostrophe's to be treated as 2 separate words when doing a spelling check or double-clicking in the word.\nTemp files are named ending in \".noindex\" to prevent Spotlight indexing and possible file deletion errors. However, under OS X 10.4 and later, Spotlight can still cause a variety of problems with Thoth and other applications, so it makes sense to disable Spotlight indexing for folders that don't benefit from such indexing. In the case of Thoth, it is strongly recommended that you disable Spotlight indexing for the \"Thoth Outbox\" folder for each news server you use (or perhaps better yet, for the folder used for each news server and its contents) and the download folders you've configured Thoth to use to save articles and binaries.\nIf you hold down the control-key while doing an Extract Binaries command, the posts are added to the Queued Transfers list but are marked as done/canceled, so that they can be downloaded at a later time.\nChanged how random signature files are recognized to eliminate the test for a file type of 'TEXT' but note that it's still important that the files be saved as plain text files and not RTF or anything else. Files with unix-style end of line breaks are now also handled properly.\nUpdated the work-around for a Carbon bug Apple still hasn't fixed that sometimes keeps windows from being shown when switching back into Thoth after Thoth's windows have been hidden via the Application menu Hide command/Hide Others command. Any window that is updated or rebuilt while hidden may fall prey to this bug, and now the work-around tries to unhide all types of windows that could be affected, including article list and message windows.\nVersion 1.8.4 makes the following additional changes:\nWorked around a problem with some news servers such as Giganews that return an unexpected 503 response code for the XHDR command for unavailable header types. The 503 response is defined for the newer HDR command but is not a standard response for the XHDR command. Also modified XHDR command handling to allow 225 as a successful response code (the correct command successful code for the newer HDR command) in addition to the standard 221 response. Thoth has also accepted the 224 response that is erroneously returned by some Microsoft news servers for many years (224 is the correct response code for the XOVER command).\nModified the wording of the checkbox in the \"Maximum Number to Fetch\" dialogs from \"Mark Unshown Posts Read\" to \"Mark \"Maximum Number\" Unread and Older Posts Read\" and updated the User Guide to explain what this option does.\nWorked around an OS X problem that could cause ever increasing RAM use when doing lots of file reads and writes (especially binary downloading).\n(May 31, 2009 edition) Worked around a problem with some news servers such as Giganews that return an unexpected 501 or 503 response code for the XHDR command for unavailable header types. Also modified XHDR command handling to allow 225 as a successful response code (the correct command successful code for the newer HDR command) in addition to the standard 221 response. Other changes were made so that a filtering failure caused by this type of server problem should no longer prevent opening an article list window.\nUser Reviews\nOpen source; $0\nCurrent Version: 3.1.1 (July 21, 2010)\nThe point of Thunderbird - as with Firefox , the new standalone Mozilla web browser component - is to take real steps toward simplifying all the great stuff that comprises the Mozilla project, allowing you to download what you need and nothing more. After Mozilla 1.4 came out, new implementations of the two main Mozilla components (web browser and newsreader/email client) have been be offered as separate downloads. Mozilla Thunderbird is the standalone email and Usenet newsreader client, available for Mac OS X.\nThunderbird is now a mauture, stable, and very capable email and usenet client, offering just about every major feature you might expect, from message and junk filtering to spell checking and beyond. Part of Thunderbird's maturity is due to the fact that Thunderbird really isn't new; it's based upon the email client and newsreader that have been included in Mozilla for quite some time. However, Thunderbird benefits from the same streamlining and interface improvements that are making Firefox so desirable: by focusing solely on standalone mail, the development team can make some dents in the overall footprint and performance of the mail client by removing components and user interface elements that they don't need. On top of that, the UI becomes much cleaner in the standalone application as opposed to being part of the Mozilla suite.\nIn addition to the feature set found in Mozilla Mail, Thunderbird has several new features and improvements to make your mail and new experience better. Highlights include:\nThe ability to customize your toolbars the way you want them. Choose View / Toolbars / Customize inside any window.\nUI extensions can be added to Mozilla Thunderbird to customize your experience with specific features and enhancements that you need. Extensions allow you to add features particular to your needs such as offline mail support .\nA new look and feel. Thunderbird also supports a large number of downloadable themes which alter the appearance of the client.\nAn addressing sidebar for mail compose which makes it easy and convient to add address book contacts to emails.\nOnline help includes a FAQ, tips and tricks and other useful information.\nSimplified preferences UI and menus.\nFootprint and performance improvements.\nApart from fixing a large number of bugs in the 2.0.x release, Thunderbird 3 made the following major enhancements:\nNew Search with Advanced Filtering Tools - Search results now include advanced filtering tools. You have the option to filter your results by sender, tag, attachments, people, folder, and mailing list. You can also filter your email using the timeline tool.\nNew Global Search Field with Autocomplete - When typing in the Global Search field, Thunderbird autocompletes against your address book. You have the option of searching everywhere or filtering against different parts of the email such as by subject or by sender.\nNew Mail Account Setup Wizard - The new Mail Account Setup Wizard matches against a database of email settings from popular mail providers so that you will only need to provide your name, email, and password to set up new mail accounts.\nRedesigned Mail Toolbar - The Mail Toolbar is redesigned to include the new Global Search bar. Buttons such as reply, forward, delete, junk are part of each email message. You can add those buttons back to the main toolbar by customizing the toolbar.\nTabbed Email Messages - Double-clicking or hitting enter on a mail message will now open that message in a New Tab window. Middle-clicking on messages or folders will open them in a Tab in the background. When quitting Thunderbird, visible tabs will be saved and will be restored when you open Thunderbird the next time. There is also a new Tab menu on the Tab toolbar to help you switch between Tabs.\nSmart Folders - The folder pane offers a Smart Folders mode which combines special mailboxes, like Inbox, from multiple accounts. Smart Folders is now on by default.\nNew Message Summary View - Selecting multiple messages will give you a summary view of the emails you have selected.\nColumn Headings - The column headings that are displayed and the order in which they are displayed can now be set on a per-folder basis.\nMessage Archive - You can now file messages from your Inbox or other folders into the new Archive folder system.\nActivity Manager - The Activity Manager records all the interactions between Thunderbird and your email provider in one place.\nNew Add-ons Manager - The new Add-ons Manager (Tools > Add-ons) can now be used to find, download, and install Thunderbird Add-ons which includes Extensions, Themes, and Plugins. Note that few Add-ons are compatible with this beta at the time of release, as Add-on developers need to upgrade them.\nImproved Address Book - If someone is in your address book, it is indicated by a new star icon which you can click to edit contact details inline. If they are not in your address book, you can add them with one click of the icon. A new birthday field allows you to keep track of your friends' birthdays. You can also add a photo for contacts in your address book.\nImproved Gmail Integration - Better recognition and integration of Gmail's special folders such as Sent and Trash including non-English versions of Gmail. Thunderbird also uses All Mail as the Archives folder.\nFor Windows Vista users, Thunderbird 3 is now integrated with Vista search results. On first start, Thunderbird will prompt to install its indexing system into Windows Vista and you can choose to see Thunderbird email and news messages in Windows search results.\nFor Mac users, Thunderbird 3 is now integrated with Spotlight, can import from Mail.app, read your OS X address book, and use Growl for new mail alerts.\nIMAP Folder Synchronization - Thunderbird will download IMAP messages by default in the background to allow for faster message loading and better offline operation. This feature can be enabled on an individual folder basis via Folder properties, or for all folders in an account via Account Settings / 'Synchronize & Storage'.\nVersion 3.1.1 provides additional enhancements:\nSeveral fixes to improve stability and security.\nSeveral fixes to the user interface.\nUser Reviews\n\"After being totally frustrated with Eudora, Netscape, and the various of MicroShaft Outlook, I tried Thunderbird. This email client is the absolute fastest, cleanest, most stable email system I have ever used in my 15+ years online. I use Thunderbird on my home system and on a business email system where it collects email from several different email addresses, all flawlessly. Outgoing mail is easy to compose, attachments just Work, and I have never had a complaint from anyone who has ever received and email generated from Thunderbird.

I know *before* I download if a file will recombine into its whole state. Unison is a giant leap forward for large file downloaders and music enthusiasts.\"\n—Ben Munson\n\"This is the first real native Mac OS X Cocoa Usenet newsreader for text. Finally there is a smart dev. that knows there was no decent Usenet newsreader (text) for Mac OS X. OK, you can say there is Unison... Unison from Panic is good, but only for binaries; it has no multi server support, auto update of groups, etc, etc, etc. The support from the dev. is also OK. It's still beta, but it's very promising! Try it out.\"\n—Wim De Smet\nAlso See . . .\nCan't find what you're looking for? Try a search:\nAlso, if you have an older Mac, be sure to check out the \"Classic\" applications page for more options.\nFinally, take a look at ALEMIA if you think you know that name of an application, but aren't quite sure.\nRelated Links\nAndrew Starr has another marvelous page about Usenet newsreaders that you simply must check out.\nKey Mac Newsgroups\nThere are several Usenet newsgroups dedicated to Macintosh-specific topics. Here are the most essential ones:\ncomp.sys.mac.announce is a moderated newsgroup that contains important general announcements to the Macintosh community.\ncomp.sys.mac.apps is the place to go when you have questions about specific Macintosh programs.\ncomp.sys.mac.comm is the place to discuss all things involving Macintosh telecommunications and Macs on the Internet.\ncomp.sys.mac.printing is for all printer- and printing-related discussion.\ncomp.sys.mac.hardware.misc is for discussion of all other Macintosh hardware-related questions.\ncomp.sys.mac.system is the place to go for MacOS-related discussions.\ncomp.sys.mac.misc is the place to post when other Macintosh-related newsgroups don't fit the bill.\nNote: If you'd like to search the Usenet for Macintosh-related information, you really only have one option (but it's a good one): Google purchased the old DejaNews (Deja.com) Usenet archive, and now offers sophisticated searching of all mainstream Usenet newsgroups, both past and present.\nAlso Consider . . .\nThese are applications that are newer and of potential interest, but which I haven't yet selected for permanent inclusion. Have a look, and let me know if you think they deserve to be part of the permanent collection!\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nQuick Reference Help Desk; ... Both Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator come with news readers, ... A name used to gain access to a computer ... General Quick Reference | PTD General Quick Reference | PTD\nGeneral\nQuick Reference\n.com, .gov, .net, .edu, .org: When these letters appear in lowercase type at the end of an address, they indicate what type of organization operates the host computer. It also means that the host computer is most likely located in the United States.\n.gif: Graphics Interchange Format - Developed by Compuserve, using Unisys compression technology, for handling vector graphics - line drawings - on the Web.\n.jpg: File extension for a JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) file type. A group that has defined a compression scheme that reduces the size of image files by up to 20 times at the cost of slightly reduced image quality.\n.mpeg: Short for Moving Picture Experts Group, and pronounced m-peg, the term also refers to the family of digital video compression standards and file formats developed by an international organization standards group. MPEG generally produces better-quality video than competing formats, such as Video for Windows, Indeo and QuickTime. MPEG files can be decoded by special hardware or by software.\nAddress Bar: An editable space in your browser window that you can type in a web address (e.g. www.penteledata.net ) or web page you want to view.\nAddress book: (email) Storage of commonly used email addresses and contact information in an email type program such as Microsoft Outlook.\nAnti-virus Software: Antivirus (or \"anti-virus\") software is a class of programs that searches your hard drive and floppy disks for any known or potential viruses.\nAttachment (email): An email attachment is another type of file not created by an email program such as Outlook Express, Eudora, or Netscape. Attachments are frequently text documents created by a word processor such as MS Word, a picture created by a graphics program, or an application that can be run on a Macintosh or PC.\nAuthentication: The process of establishing the authenticity of an object (e.g. authentication of a user by password or signature).\nBandwidth: The amount of data that can be sent through a connection, usually measured in bits-per-second.\nBaud Rate: The baud rate of a modem refers to the speed of the modem. It will tell you how many bits the modem can send or receive per second. For example, a 28.8 baud modem can send or receive 28,800 bits per second (bps).\nBookmark: A name or address of an Internet resource stored in a software file on a user's computer for convenient future use. Note: An example of a bookmark is an entry in a bookmark file (or list) maintained by a browser for the convenience of the user in revisiting a website.\nBounce back message: When a user attempts to send an email, he is telling his email system to look for the domain of the recipient (for example, ptd.net) and the domain's mail server. Once the email system makes contact with the recipient's mail server, the mail server looks at the message to determine if it will let the message pass through the server. If the recipient's server has predetermined that it is not accepting emails from the sender's address (for example, if it has blocked the address for anti-spamming purposes), the server will reject the message and it will subsequently bounce back to the sender. The message will also bounce back to the server if the mail server on the recipient's end is busy and cannot handle the request at that time. When an email is returned to the sender without being accepted by the recipient's mail server, this is called a hard bounce.\nBrowser: An application used for accessing the World Wide Web (WWW). To 'browse' is to search the WWW for information. Examples of browsers include: Internet Explorer, Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox, Opera, and Apple Computer's Safari.\nBps: Bits per second. A measurement of how fast data is transmitted from one place to another. A 28.8 modem can move 28,800 bits per second.\nCable Modem: A modem designed to operate over cable TV lines. Because the coaxial cable used by cable TV provides much greater bandwidth than telephone lines, a cable modem can be used to achieve extremely fast access to the World Wide Web.\nCache: Pronounced cash, a special high-speed storage mechanism. It can be either a reserved section of main memory or an independent high-speed storage device. Two types of caching are commonly used in personal computers: memory caching and disk caching.\nChat Room: A virtual room where a chat session takes place. Technically, a chat room is really a channel, but the term room is used to promote the chat metaphor.\nCookies: A mechanism for server-side connections to store and retrieve information on the client side.\nCyberspace: A virtual universe of networked computers, programs, and data.\nDaemon: Pronounced DEE-mun or DAY-mun. A process that runs in the background and performs a specified operation at predefined times or in response to certain events. The term daemon is a UNIX term, though many other operating systems provide support for daemons, they're sometimes called other names. Windows, for example, refers to daemons as System Agents and services.\nDefault: A value or setting that a device or program automatically selects if you do not specify a substitute. For example, word processors have default margins and default page lengths that you can override or reset.\nDesktop: In graphical user interfaces, a desktop is the metaphor used to portray file systems. Such a desktop consists of pictures, called icons, that show cabinets, files, folders, and various types of documents (that is, letters, reports, pictures). You can arrange the icons on the electronic desktop just as you can arrange real objects on a real desktop - moving them around, putting one on top of another, reshuffling them, and throwing them away.\nDial-up: A form of Internet connection for your home. Dial-up is a connection from your computer to the Internet over a telephone line via an Internet Service Provider like PenTeleData.\nDial-up Networking: A component in Windows that enables you to connect your computer to a network via a modem. If your computer is not connected to a local area network (LAN) and you want to connect to the Internet, you need to configure Dial-up Networking (DUN) to dial a Point of Presence (POP) and log into your Internet Service Provider (ISP).\nYou can access DUN through the \"My Computer\" icon in Windows 95/98 and through the Start menu in Windows ME. In Windows XP, you can configure DUN through the \"Control Panel.\"\nDigital: Describes any system based on discontinuous data or events. Computers are digital machines because at their most basic level they can distinguish between just two values, 0 and 1, or off and on. There is no simple way to represent all the values in between, such as 0.25. All data that a computer processes must be encoded digitally, as a series of zeroes and ones.\nThe opposite of digital is analog. A typical analog device is a clock in which the hands move continuously around the face. Such a clock is capable of indicating every possible time of day. In contrast, a digital clock is capable of representing only a finite number of times (every tenth of a second, for example).\nDisk Space: Disk space is the storage capacity of your Web site for pictures, HTML, graphics, etc. and is usually expressed in MB.\nDOCSIS: Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification defines interface standards for cable modems and supporting equipment. DOCSIS specifies downstream traffic transfer rates between 27 and 36 Mbps over a radio frequency (RF) path in the 50 MHz to 750+ MHz range, and upstream traffic transfer rates between 320 Kbps and 10 Mbps over a RF path between 5 and 42 MHz. But, because data over cable travels on a shared loop, individuals will see transfer rates drop as more users gain access.\nDomain Name: A domain name is a name which is used to find a specific location on the Internet. Domain names are tied to specific IP addresses assigned to given hosts. While domain names are not necessary to find given hosts on the Internet, they are much easier to remember. For example, PenTeleData.net is a domain. If you wanted to go to PenTeleData's web page, you could enter www.penteledata.net into your browser.\nDownload: To retrieve a file from another machine, usually a host machine, to your machine.\nDSL (Digital Subscriber Line): DSL is a technology for bringing high-bandwidth information to homes and small businesses over ordinary copper telephone lines. xDSL refers to different variations of DSL, such as ADSL, HDSL, and RADSL. With DSL service, you may be able to receive data at rates up to 6.1 Mbps, enabling continuous transmission of motion video, audio, and even 3D effects. A DSL line can carry both data and voice signals.\neBay: Founded in September 1995, eBay ( www.ebay.com ) is an online marketplace for the sale of goods and services by a diverse community of individuals and businesses. Today, the eBay community includes tens of millions of registered members from around the world. It has been reported that people spend more time on eBay than any other online site, making it the most popular shopping destination on the Internet.\nEMail: Email, or electronic mail, is a method of sending text messages from one person's computer to another through the Internet. An email address would look something like johndoe@ptd.net .\nEMailbox: An emailbox is a storage area for email. A user receives their private emailbox. This is similar to a Post Office Box except electronic.\nEMail Forwarding: Email forwarding gives you the ability to have email that is sent to one email address automatically forwarded to another email address.\nFor example, you could have all email sent to yourname@hotmail.com forwarded to yourname@ptd.net .\nEncryption: The translation of data into a secret code. Encryption is the most effective way to achieve data security. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a secret key or password that enables you to decrypt it.\nEthernet: A technology, which allows you to network machines together in a local area network (LAN). Ethernet is commonly used because of its incredible speed and scalability.\nFAQ (Frequently Asked Questions): A list of commonly asked questions and answers that are related to the features and procedures of a company's products and services. A \"FAQ\" acts as a help file for the end user.\nFavorites: - See \"Bookmarks\".\nFile Sharing (peer to peer): File sharing is the public or private sharing of computer data or space in a network with various levels of access privilege. While files can easily be shared outside a network (for example, simply by handing or mailing someone your file on a storage device), the term file sharing almost always means sharing files in a network, even if in a small local area network. File sharing allows a number of people to use the same file or file by some combination of being able to read or view it, write to or modify it, copy it, or print it.\nFilter: A program that accepts a certain type of data as input, transforms it in some manner, and then outputs the transformed data. For example, a program that sorts names is a filter because it accepts the names in unsorted order, sorts them, and then outputs the sorted names.\nFirewall: A firewall is a security device that allows you to prevent unwanted accesses into, or out of, your network. A simple firewall can be built by installing firewall software on a computer linked to a network.\nFreeware: Copyrighted software given away for free by the author. Although it is available for free, the author retains the copyright, which means that you cannot do anything with it that is not expressly allowed by the author. Usually, the author allows people to use the software, but not sell it.\nF.T.P. (File Transfer Protocol): This protocol is used for downloading and uploading files over the Internet. With FTP, you can log into another Internet site and send or receive files. Some sites have public files that you can access via FTP by using the account name \"anonymous\" and your email address as the password. This type of access is called \"anonymous\" FTP.\nGHz: Abbreviation for gigahertz. One GHz represents 1 billion cycles per second. The speed of microprocessors, called the clock speed, often is measured in gigahertz. For example, a microprocessor that runs at 200 GHz executes 200 billion cycles per second. Each computer instruction requires a fixed number of cycles, so the clock speed determines how many instructions per second the microprocessor can execute.\nGigabyte: (\"gig\") 1 gigabyte = approximately 1 billion bytes. More accurately, 1 gigabyte = 2 to the 30th power or 1,073,741,824 bytes.\nHacker: A slang term for a computer enthusiast (i.e. a person who enjoys learning programming languages and computer systems and can often be considered an expert on the subjects). Among professional programmers, the term can be either complimentary or derogatory, although it is developing an increasingly derogatory connotation. The negative sense of \"hacker\" is becoming more prominent largely because the popular press has begun using the term to refer to individuals who gain unauthorized access to computer systems for the purpose of stealing and corrupting data. Hackers, themselves, maintain that the proper term for such individuals is \"cracker.\"\nHeader: In many disciplines of computer science, a header is a unit of information that precedes a data object. In a network transmission, a header is part of the data packet and contains transparent information about the file or the transmission. In file management, a header is a region at the beginning of each file where bookkeeping information is kept. The file header may contain the date the file was created, the date it was last updated, and the file's size. The header can be accessed only by the operating system or by specialized programs.\nHome Page: A home page most often refers to the web page you see when you first start up your web browser. It can also refer to the first page that appears when you visit a specific site like www.ptd.net\nHost: A computer on the Internet you may be able to log on to. You can use FTP to get files from a host computer, and use other programs (such as telnet) to make use of the host computer.\nHTML: Hyper Text Markup Language, is the most common language used to create web pages. HTML is a language, which essentially formats text and images in any number of ways. HTML also allows you to create links which will point people to various other parts of that web site, or to other web sites altogether.\nHTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is the protocol that is used to transfer web pages across the Internet.\nHyperlink: An element in an electronic document that links to another place in the same document or to an entirely different document. Typically, you click on the hyperlink to follow the link. Hyperlinks are the most essential ingredient of all hypertext systems, including the World Wide Web.\niMac: The iMac is a low-cost version of Apple Computer's Macintosh. The iMac was designed to attract people who have never owned a personal computer and also to win back former Mac users who have moved to a personal computer. Released in mid-August, 1998, the initial version of the iMac featured a sleekly-molded designer-colored translucent case with a built-in 15-inch display, a fast 233 MHz processor, and the Mac OS operating system.\nIMAP: Short for Internet Message Access Protocol, a protocol for retrieving email messages. The latest version, IMAP4, is similar to POP3 but supports some additional features. For example, with IMAP4, you can search through your email messages for keywords while the messages are still on the mail server. You can then choose which messages to download to your machine.\nInbox: The collection station for all incoming email, commonly broken down into directories and subdirectories for easy identification and categorization of correspondence.\nInstant Messenger: Free software users can install on their workstation to chat in real time with other users on the Internet who are using the same program.\nInternet: The Internet is made up from the millions of servers which are interconnected via the TCP/IP protocol. The Internet evolved from its humble beginnings as the ARPANET in the late 60's and early 70's.\nIntranet: An intranet is like a small private Internet, which is intended to be accessed by a specific group or groups of computers. Often companies will set up intranets for their own internal use to allow employees to see company information without allowing access to this private information by the entire Internet.\nIP Address: An IP address is the address given to each computer that is on the Internet. Without an IP address, a computer cannot communicate with the rest of the computers on the Internet. These addresses have 4 parts, known as octets, and are separated by dots; e.g., 207.229.143.1.\nIRC (Internet Relay Chat): A system that enables Internet users to talk with each other in real time over the Internet rather than in person.\nISDN: Integrated Services Digital Network: A way to move more data over existing regular phone lines. ISDN is only slowly becoming available in the USA. ISDN can provide speeds of 64,000 bits per second over a regular phone line at almost the same cost as a normal phone call.\nISP: (Internet Service Provider) for example, PenTeleData Internet Service.\nIST: Integration Service Team: PenTeleData's Integration Service Team is a specialized unit that caters to schools, businesses, and professionals within PenTeleData, the leading Technology and Internet service firm throughout the tri-state area. We use our expertise to help you from beginning to end. Our IST within PenTeleData will design, install, train, support and service your technological solution.\nJava: Java is an object-oriented language similar to C++, but simplified to eliminate language features that cause common programming errors. Java source code files (files with a .java extension) are compiled into a format called bytecode (files with a .class extension), which can then be executed by a Java interpreter. Compiled Java code can run on most computers because Java interpreters and runtime environments, known as Java Virtual Machines (VMs), exist for most operating systems, including UNIX, the Macintosh OS, and Windows. Bytecode can also be converted directly into machine language instructions by a just-in-time compiler (JIT).\nLAN (Local Area Network): A LAN, or Local Area Network, consists of a network of machines confined to one geographic area, such as an office building.\nLimited Access: The opposite of unlimited access: reduced user access to a network or the Internet.\nLinks: By inserting hypertext links into web documents it is possible to connect two documents together. These documents can be on different computers on opposite sides of the globe.\nListserv: A family of programs that manages mailing lists by distributing messages posted to the list, adding and deleting members automatically.\nLogin: A noun or a verb. Noun: The account name used to gain access to a computer system. Unlike a password, the login name is not a secret. Verb: The act of entering into a computer system; for example, \"Login to the WELL and then go to the GBN conference.\"\nMac Address: Short for Media Access Control address, a Mac address is a hardware address that uniquely identifies each node of a network.\nMail client: An application that runs on a personal computer or workstation and enables you to send, receive and organize email. It's called a client because email systems are based on client-server architecture. Mail is sent from many clients to a central server, which re-routes the mail to its intended destination.\nMail Server: A mail server is usually a program that runs on a computer designated exclusively for the processing and storage of user email.\nMailing list: A list of email addresses identified by a single name, such as mail-list@sandybay.com . When an email message is sent to the mailing list name, it is automatically forwarded to all the addresses in the list.\nMail-Me: A Mail-Me account provides a user the ability to dial into any local PenTeleData location and connect to the mail server to retrieve Email. This is ideal for someone who would like the convenience of Email but does not need access to the World Wide Web. This account does not provide the ability to surf the Internet. If you're already connected to the Internet, you can Telnet into your Mail Me account to send and receive Email. If you aren't already online, you can dial into any of our locations using a VT100 compatible terminal program (not compatible using Microsoft Dial-up Networking) and use a text-based, ASCII email program such as Pine to send and retrieve email. Using this type of dial-in connection doesn't require any additional software. In fact, the dialing Terminal Program used to dial in is included with a standard Windows operating system. Detailed instructions for the use of this program are readily available in the Help section of your Windows software and elsewhere online.\nMbps: Short for megabits per second, a measure of data transfer speed (a megabit is equal to one million bits). Network transmissions, for example, are generally measured in Mbps.\nMHz: An abbreviation for megahertz. One MHz represents one million cycles per second. The speed of microprocessors, called the clock speed, is sometimes measured in megahertz. For example, a microprocessor that runs at 900 MHz executes 900 million cycles per second. Each computer instruction requires a fixed number of cycles, so the clock speed determines how many instructions per second the microprocessor can execute.\nModem: MOdulator, DEModulator: A device that you connect to your computer and to a phone line to allow the computer to talk to other computers through the phone system. Modems convert the computer's digital signals into analog waves that can be transmitted over standard voice telephone lines. Modem speeds are measured in bits per second (bps)-also sometimes expressed as Kilobits (thousands of bits) per second.\nModem Driver: The piece of software that allows your operating system (e.g. Windows, Mac OS, UNIX) to communicate with your modem. One of the essential steps in keeping your dial-up Internet connection running smoothly is updating your modem driver. For today's modems, drivers are much more important than the definitions make them sound.\nNetwork: A network is 2 or more computers connected together (commonly using Ethernet) to allow for file and resource sharing.\nNewsgroups: A Newsgroup is an on-line discussion group. On the Internet, there are literally thousands of newsgroups covering every conceivable interest. To view and post messages to a newsgroup, you need a news reader, a program that runs on your computer and connects you to a news server on the Internet.\nNews Reader: Sometimes spelled as one word, a news reader is a client application that enables you to read messages posted to Internet newsgroups, and to post your own messages. Both Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator come with news readers, but there are also freeware, shareware and commercial stand-alone news readers.\nNode: Any given computer connected to a network.\nOutbox: Collection station for outgoing correspondence before it's released through the gateway separating your local machine from a larger network, including the Internet.\nPacket: A chunk of information sent over a network. Each packet contains the destination address, the sender's address, error-control information, and data.\nPADLOCK®: A revolutionary new service offered by PenTeleData, PADLOCK® is an easy to use, cost-effective way to regulate traffic flowing in and out of any company's Internet connection: protect your company's interests by implementing a PADLOCK® filtering solution from PenTeleData.\nPassword: A secret series of characters that enables a user to access a file, computer, or program. On multi-user systems, each user must enter his or her password before the computer will respond to commands. The password helps ensure that unauthorized users do not access the computer. In addition, data files and programs may require a password.\nPC: Short for personal computer or IBM PC. The first personal computer produced by IBM was called the PC, and increasingly the term PC came to mean IBM or IBM-compatible personal computers, to the exclusion of other types of personal computers, such as Macintoshes.\nPing: A command/utility to determine whether a specific IP address is accessible. It works by sending a packet to the specified address and waiting for a reply. Ping is used primarily to troubleshoot Internet connections.\nPlug-in: A hardware or software module that adds a specific feature or service to a larger system. For example, there are a number of plug-ins for the Netscape Navigator browser that enables it to display different types of audio or video messages.\nPOP: Short for Post Office Protocol, a protocol used to retrieve email from a mail server. Most email applications (sometimes called an email client) use the POP protocol, although some can use the newer IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol).\nalso…Short for Point of Presence, a telephone number that gives you dial-up access. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) generally provide many POPs so that users can make a local call to gain Internet access.\nPop-up Window: A window that suddenly appears (pops up) on your desktop while surfing the WWW or when you select an option with a mouse or press a special function key. Pop-up windows that appear while browsing the Internet usually contain advertisements and will remain on the screen until you close them. Those pop-ups that appear when selecting an option or pressing a function key usually contain a menu of options and stay on the screen until you select one of the options.\nPop-up Stopper: Software any PenTeleData user is free to download without charge to install on his workstation which bars the presence of distracting pop-up web browser advertisements from appearing.\nPort: An interface on a computer to which you can connect a device. PCs have various types of ports (e.g. USB, serial, parallel, PS/2).\nA second type of port on a computer is a communications port. These ports allow the computer to communicate with other computers over a network or the Internet. Such ports are not visible but are assigned specific names and numbers. For example, computers usually use TCP port 25 to send and receive email, and TCP port 80 is used to send and receive most web pages.\nPPP: or Point to Point Protocol, is the protocol that is used to make an Internet connection using an analog modem and a phone line.\nProxy: A server that sits between a client application, such as a Web browser, and a real server. It intercepts all requests to the real server to see if it can fulfill the requests itself. If not, it forwards the request to the real server.\nQuickTime: A video and animation system developed by Apple Computer. QuickTime is built into the Macintosh operating system and is used by most Mac applications that include video or animation. PCs can also run files in QuickTime format, but they require a special QuickTime driver. QuickTime supports most encoding formats, including Cinepak, JPEG, and MPEG. QuickTime is competing with a number of other standards, including AVI and ActiveMovie.\nReal Player: A brand name in streaming audio & video software, designed to allow personal computer users to send and receive audio, video, and other multimedia services throughout the WWW.\nRemote Access: When you access a computer that you are unable to see. This is done via a modem or computer network.\nRouter: A router is a piece of equipment that determines where to send pieces of data between networks. Because there may be multiple paths between 2 or more networks, a router will also determine the best path for that data so that it finds its destination quickly and successfully.\nSearch Engine: A software program, found on-line, that searches a database, gathers and then reports the information onto a page to be viewed. The information contained is related to the specified terms that were requested. (example: web sites, newsgroups)\nSecurity Certificate: A chunk of information that is used by the Secure Socket Layer protocol to establish a secure connection. In order for an SSL connection to be created, both sides must have a valid Security Certificate.\nServer: A server is a machine that provides a service to software running on other machines. For example, a web browser (the client) must communicate with a web server in order to display web pages. It is possible for one server to perform many roles depending on how many server software packages are installed on it.\nService Provider: A service provider is a company that supplies Internet services to personal users or business. Among other things they provide access to the Internet or somewhere to place Web Pages making them available to the WWW. You pay the service provider a set fee.\nShareware: Software distributed on the basis of an honor system. Most shareware is delivered free of charge, but the author usually requests that you pay a small fee if you like the program and use it regularly. By sending the small fee, you become registered with the producer so that you can receive service assistance and updates. You can copy shareware and pass it along to friends and colleagues, but they too are expected to pay a fee if they use the product.\nShopping Cart: A shopping cart is a piece of software that acts as an online store's catalog and ordering process. Typically, a shopping cart is the interface between a company's web site and its deeper infrastructure, allowing consumers to select merchandise; review what they have selected; make necessary modifications or additions; and purchase the merchandise.\nSMTP: Simple Mail Transport Protocol, is the protocol used to send electronic mail over the Internet.\nSpam: An inappropriate use of email, mailing lists, USENET (newsgroups), or other communication methods by sending a message to someone who didn't ask for it. Spam is analogous to junk mail that you receive in your mail box. Spam is generally sent to multiple people at one time for the purpose of advertising a business (beware the \"Make Money Fast\" email), propagate chain mail (\"Send this message to 10 people\", etc) or interest you in going to various web sites (commonly adult oriented in nature). Apart from being bad etiquette, sending SPAM from your PenTeleData account is prohibited. (From most ISP accounts)\nSpyware: Also called adware, spyware is any software that covertly gathers user information through the user's Internet connection without his or her knowledge, usually for advertising purposes. Spyware applications are typically bundled as a hidden component of freeware or shareware programs that can be downloaded from the Internet. Once installed, the spyware monitors user activity on the Internet and transmits that information in the background to someone else. Spyware can also gather information about email addresses and even passwords and credit card numbers.\nSSL: Short for Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private documents via the Internet. SSL works by using a public key to encrypt data that's transferred over the SSL connection. Both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer support SSL, and many Web sites use the protocol to obtain confidential user information, such as credit card numbers. By convention, URLs that require an SSL connection start with https: instead of http:.\nT1: The T1 carrier is the most commonly used digital line in the United States, Canada, and Japan. In these countries, it carries 24 pulse code modulation (PCM) signals using time-division multiplexing (TDM) at an overall rate of 1.544 million bits per second (Mbps). T1 lines use copper wire and span distances within and between major metropolitan areas. A T1 Outstate System has been developed for longer distances between cities.\nT3: Another level, the T-3 line, provides 44.736 Mbps, is also commonly used by Internet service providers.\nTCP/IP (Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): The system that networks use to communicate on the Internet.\nTelnet: The command and program used to login from one Internet site to another. The Telnet command/program gets you to the \"login\" prompt of another host.\nTemporary files: Temporary files, by definition, are intended to be just that - temporary - and are not meant to be saved indefinitely.\nTerminal: A device that allows you to send commands to a computer somewhere else. At a minimum, this usually means a keyboard and a display screen and some simple circuitry. Usually you will use terminal software in a personal computer - the software pretends to be (\"emulates\") a physical terminal and allows you to type commands to a computer somewhere else.\nTerms of Service: A stated list of the terms that must be agreed on by a user of a particular service; the terms under which a service provider provides a particular service.\nTimeout: A time limit for an operation. If the timeout period expires before the operation completes successfully, some default or alternative action is taken.\nToolbar: A series of selectable buttons in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that give the user an easy way to select desktop, application or web browser functions. Toolbars are typically displayed as either a horizontal row or a vertical column around the edges of the GUI where they are visible while the application is in use. Most applications use toolbars as they give the user another option aside from pull-down menus.\nUpload: To transmit data from a computer to a bulletin board service, mainframe, or network. For example, if you use a personal computer to log on to a network and you want to send files across the network, you must upload the files from your PC to the network.\nURL: A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is the address of any resource on the Internet such as a web page, an FTP site, or a newsgroup; e.g., http://www.penteledata.com.   If someone asks you for your web address, they're really asking you for the URL.\nUsenet: An informal group of systems that exchange \"news.\" USENET predates the Internet, but today, the Internet is used to transfer much of USENET's traffic.\nUsername: A name used to gain access to a computer system. Usernames, and often passwords, are required in multi-user systems. In most such systems, users can choose their own usernames and passwords.\nVirus: A program or piece of code that is loaded onto your computer without your knowledge and runs against your wishes. Viruses can also replicate themselves. All computer viruses are manmade. A simple virus that can make a copy of itself over and over again is relatively easy to produce. Even such a simple virus is dangerous because it will quickly use all available memory and bring the system to a halt. An even more dangerous type of virus is one capable of transmitting itself across networks and bypassing security systems.\nWAN (Wide Area Network): Any Internet or network that covers an area larger than a single building or campus. (See also: Internet, LAN (Local Area Network) or network)\nWeb address: The location, or URL, of a website, file, or resource on the Internet. For example, http://www.penteledata.net/ is a web address.\nWeb page: A document on the World Wide Web. Every Web page is identified by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).\nWorld Wide Web: The World Wide Web (abbreviated as WWW or W3, commonly known as the web) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. With a web browser, one can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them via hyperlinks. (Wikipedia)\nZIP: A popular data compression format. Files that have been compressed with the ZIP format are called ZIP files and usually end with a .ZIP extension. A special kind of zipped file is a self-extracting file, which ends with a.EXE extension. You can unzip a self-extracting file by simply executing it.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nNetscape Navigator Vs. Microsoft Internet Explorer ... compare the latest releases of Netscape Navigator ... with the name of the company, Netscape ... Netscape Navigator Vs. Microsoft Internet Explorer - Who ... Netscape Navigator Vs. Microsoft Internet Explorer - Who Will Win the Browser Wars, and Will the Outcome Affect Desktop Computing?\nAbstract\nWith the Internet becoming increasingly popular as a method of information retrieval and advertising, in addition to being used for advanced functions such as database applications and interactive applications, the question arises as to which browser to use to take full advantage of the Internet. For instance, which browser has more features, and which of these features are of greater importance for effective \"web browsing\"?\nThis project will evaluate the two most popular and advanced browsers used today - Internet Explorer 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 3.0. Certain features of each browser will be evaluated, with a look at basic browser functions as well some more advanced functions that will have effect on the future of desktop computing. Results of the evaluation will be comprised from outside evaluation results, as well as results from an independent test I will perform on each browser.\nThe information presented does not look at every feature of Navigator 3.0 or Internet Explorer 3.0. Some areas may not be explained in detail to some readers' satisfaction. One reason for this is  that a detailed explanation of each browser feature would require a book. The primary reason is that the focus is more on the features that have implications for the trends for desktop computing as seen by Netscape and Microsoft. While there are comparisons on \"trivial\" browser features, not every feature was examined.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this project is to describe the differences, attributes, and problems with both Netscape Navigator 3.0 and Internet Explorer 3.0, to assist users in deciding which browser is more suitable for them. While the 4.0 version of both browsers will be available in 1997, both with new features and strong implications for the future of desktop computing, I will not be comparing upcoming features in the next release. The focus here is on the current release of both browsers, and speculation and the rating of attributes and features not yet released is not the purpose here. The implications for the future of desktop computing can be seen in the current release of these browsers, and these implications will be addressed, though the outcome will not really be known until the release and wide implementation of Netscape 4.0 and Internet Explorer 4.0 take place.\nUnless otherwise noted, Microsoft's Internet Explorer version 3.0 will be referred to as IE, and Netscape Navigator version 3.0 will be referred to as Navigator (to avoid confusion with the name of the company, Netscape Corporation). If an earlier version of the browser is being referred to, that will be so noted.\nIntroduction\nHistory of the \"Web Browser\"\nIt was just over two years ago that graphical user interface web browsers were developed, the first one being NCSA Mosaic. Before the advent of browsers, around 1991, the University of Minnesota developed the Internet Gopher, which enabled information to be provided on the Internet in hierarchical lists. About the same time, Tim Berners-Lee and colleges at the CERN European Laboratory for Particle Physics were developing a networked hypertext system called the World Wide Web (WWW) (Nichols, 1996). In contrast to gopher's hierarchical structure, the WWW includes embedded \"hot links\" to other documents which leads to other documents. This is how the WWW is known today.\nIn 1993, NCSA announced their plan to release a new client called Mosaic. In fact, many  say that Mosaic was the enabling tool for the use of the Web as a networked  information distribution mechanism. Up until about 1994 sometime,  there were two main Microsoft Windows browsers for the World-Wide Web: Mosaic and Cello. Since these \"early browsers\", various precedents have been set in the production and distribution that are radically different from any other software product in the software industry (PC Direct, 1996).\nOne reason for these precedents is due to the fact that browsers were basically free. While individual users were supposed to pay a license fee, numerous organizations qualified for free usage under Mosaic's terms,  and the distribution was too hard to monitor. In addition, the production cycle for browsers enabled the free distribution. Since browsers were distributed online, there was no need for packaging, distributing, and reselling (PC Direct, 1996).\nWith almost no time lag for placing a browser on the market, software developers could easily add new features or bug-patches daily. This continuous upgrade cycle enabled users to download free evaluation copies easily.\nThe history of Mosaic since then has been \"dramatic:\" a constant flow of updates; the licensing of the program to a variety of companies, including Microsoft; and the appearance of Netscape (Moody, 1996). It seemed for a while that Navigator would be the dominant browser, as it's features quickly surpasses that of Mosaic. However, Microsoft entered the game this year with version 3.0 of their Internet Explorer - an incredible upgrade from their previous version, which lacked most of Netscape's advanced features.\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer 3.0\nBoth browsers, while having differences,  are very similar, and have to have some identical features. This is because the browser is based on supporting Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The standard for HTML is currently version 3.2, and needs to be supported by all browsers to make the Web open and accessible to all, no matter which browser is used (PC Direct, 1996).  Browser companies know that not supporting the standard of HTML would undermine the Internet market, since the simplicity of HTML and the standardization of the WWW are what makes it so attractive to so many people.\nWhile many of the features are very similar in IE and Navigator, certain differences can be seen, some minor and some more major. Many of the differences can be attributed to the way each company sees the future of the Internet and the user's PC. Microsoft will be integrating the next version of IE as a component in the desktop of the PC, while Netscape is aiming for their browser to become a \"universal client\", where the browser itself will almost replace the desktop (Sun Developer News, 1996). This will be addressed a bit later, in the description of the two browsers' different implementations of Java and ActiveX, as describing this more complex issue before even touching on the more basic features of each browser could be confusing. The future plans for the desktop, though, will be more apparent in release 4.0 of both browsers, and an entire paper could be written on these upcoming plans alone.\nPlatform Support\nPlatform support is often confused with operating systems support. An example of a platform would be Windows, Unix, Mac, and OS/2. But there are different variations on each platform, and these variations are operating systems. The Windows platform encompasses Windows '95, Windows 3.1, and Windows NT. Unix has 12 variations. Nowadays, the most well-known platform is Windows, both 3.1 and '95. While Windows '95 would be considered the most popular, many people still use Windows 3.1, especially if they have not upgraded their PC.\nAt the moment, IE supports four operating systems,  - Windows '95, Windows NT, Windows 3.1 and Macintosh. Navigator supports sixteen, including 12 of the more popular Unix operating systems, Windows 3.1, Macintosh, as well as Windows '95 and Windows NT. This is a major advantage for Navigator, since the world, despite how Bill Gates may see it, is not limited to Windows and Mac users.\nWhile it may be argued that Microsoft has promised to support  other platforms, nothing concrete has materialized.  However, Microsoft back in June of 1996 overstepped the charge of \"platform bias\" by promising that may Unix operating systems will have \"full Explorer 3.0 functionality, including ActiveX\" by years end (Ray, July 1996).  Well, it's now 1997 and and a Unix version of IE is not yet available. In addition, the specific Unix operating systems that will be supported was not specified. Will Microsoft support all 12 aforementioned variants of UNIX?\nPlatform support will be addressed again in the discussion of Java and ActiveX, where many issues touched on here will come together. The differences in platform support are also a key issue in the how Microsoft and Netscape see the future of desktop computing.\nOne should also note that both browsers are lacking full  support for IBM's OS/2. Microsoft has no browser whatsoever available for OS/2 and has never stated they would ever support it.  Navigator does have version 2.02 available for OS/2, but not version 3.0, as they will supposedly jump right to Navigator 4.0 for  OS/2.\nInterface\nBoth browsers have a similar type of interface, with a menu and button bar above the browser window. In general, IE's slick new interface is more appealing than Navigator's. IE's raised, frameless menu icons that light up when a mouse is placed over them, customizable address bar and links menu make it look more up-to-date and increase the ease of use. IE also includes a font button right on the menu bar for the user to take advantage of the variable font settings standard in HTML 3.2 (PC Direct, 1996). In addition, the search feature to search the current web document showing, is clearer on IE. While Navigator's button is labeled \"search\" for searching the document currently showing in the browser, IE goes a step further to label it's option for this (found under \"Edit\" on the main menu) as \"find on this page.\" (Santalesa, 1996). While this may seem like a negligible difference, it's easy to misunderstand the function or become confused by the \"search\" button. Many tend to think the button is used to search the Internet, not the current web document. IE clears up this confusion.\nHowever, Navigator's method for presenting information while connecting to a site is a bit better. IE displays the site IP number instead of the name. For instance, Navigator will show http://www.interstat.net while IE will show 206.181.182.2. While not a major difference, numbers are not as \"friendly\" as the actual URL.  In addition, IE doesn't not give an indication of the file sizes while downloading, instead opting for a graph showing what percentage of the file has been received (PC Direct, 1996).\nBookmarks\nBookmarks, while not the most important feature in a browser, are certainly a very convenient item. Given the amount of information being placed on the web daily, imagine having to write down every URL you wanted to remember, or trying to find the same URL again! Bookmarks also let the user categorize and sort bookmarks into sections, so their URLS are much easier to find in the bookmark list.\nBoth browsers support bookmarks, or Favorites, as they are called in IE. Bookmarks in Navigator are easier to manage, and allows the user to insert separators, group bookmarks easily, see details of the last time the bookmark was used, and control the duration of the link (PC Direct, 1996). However, IE also includes a History folder that tracks every page visited for a certain number of days. The number of days is defined by the user, and makes backtracking much easier (Santalesa, 1996). Navigator provides a history, but only for the current session.\nHowever, users may want to consider the differences in the size of Navigator's and IE's bookmark files. That's right - size. The same bookmark file in Navigator will take up A LOT more disk space in IE. For example, a 458-KB bookmark file in Navigator takes up in IE- please sit down - anywhere between 18MB and 38MB, depending on the computer system (Santalesa, 1996). IE's Favorites take up significantly more space than Navigator's bookmarks, because each Favorite (bookmark) in IE becomes a Windows shortcut that, depending on the users disk-block size, actually uses up 16KB to 32 KB per entry. Those low on disk space and using IE should keep their Favorites  folder to a minimum!\nMail and News\nBoth Navigator and IE support sending and receiving HTML, so e-mail can be sent with images, sound, and even Java effects. (Schwartz, 1996). Netscape has gone a step further though and made deals with several Internet content providers to deliver customized e-mail to users' in-boxes regularly with a feature called Inbox Direct (PC Direct, 1996). Navigator also includes the feature to be able to display only unread inbox messages.\nIE, however, as items such as Inbox Assistant, which performs mail filtering. Users can set up a folder and specify which messages should automatically be filtered into that particular folder (Santalesa, 1996). IE's Internet news reader is also more intuitive for new users, while Navigator's integrated Usenet client is easier when skimming multiple groups (Santalesa, 1996).\nHTML Support\nWhile Navigator 3.0 introduces several new, non-standard table-formatting extensions to HTML 3.2, such as multicolumn layout, spacing and frame-border enhancements, IE 3.0 includes HTML 3.2 specifications that Navigator does not, including level 1 Cascading Style Sheets and floating frames. IE 3.0 is the first browser to support Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), the HTML style sheet standard set by the W3C. Style sheets give users the same flexibility of design and layout that desktop publishing programs do, by enabling them to attach styles (such as fonts, colors, and spacing) to HTML pages. By applying separate style tags to HTML, web page designers ensure that all browsers (that support CSS) can view the basic text and structure of the Web page while  more sophisticated designs can be presented. This is a very useful feature lacking in Navigator.\nDownload Time\nDownloading the Browsers Themselves!\nA full version of Navigator is about 5.5 MB while a full version of IE is about 8 MB, so obviously the download time is shorter for Navigator - a big plus for modem users. The extra download time for IE is due to its ActiveX controls. However, adding ActiveX support to Netscape requires a plug-in, which is an additional 3.5 MB (Santalesa, 1996).\nDownloading Web Pages and Documents\nBoth companies stress that their browser downloads files faster. It is sometimes difficult to determine the browser's speed due to the differences in ISP connections, local disk speeds, and host web servers. While both products give substantial speed increases over older browsers,  Navigator has a slight edge in downloading most pages, though IE executes Java applets faster.\nKeyLabs Inc., an independent network testing organization, released the results of its performance comparison of Navigator and IE in October. Testing was designed to measure performance while transferring actual Internet HTML files. File sets were grouped according to size. Download time was measured on a range of 10-100 Pentium class client computers. For small and medium files, Netscape turned in a more than 200 percent better performance. Microsoft's Internet Explorer narrowed the gap when downloading larger files, although Netscape's Navigator was still about 30 percent faster. The full details of this test are available at  http://www.keylabs.com./shootout.htm (no longer available)\nIn my personal testing of various sites, Navigator always connected and downloaded the page seconds, or even minutes faster than IE. This was done with an empty cache on both browsers, at approximately 11pm EST, using a T-1 connection at my office. While seconds may not seem like a significant difference, it does add up. However, there are many other variables to consider, such as the traffic on the particular site, time of day, etc.\nOther tests have claimed that IE \"occasionally gave up on pages, which Navigator, running alongside it, retrieved without a hitch\" (Green, 1996). In another independent test, IE had a problem with downloading Intel's home page due to a VB Script that Navigator ignored, but produced \"near paralysis\" for IE (Santalesa, 1996). The problem appears to be fixed, as I visited the site on Dec 5, 1996,  and it showed no problems for IE.\nOne site that did show a problem was the Macromedia Web site. I visited the site on December 5, 1996 and Navigator downloaded the site in seconds, while IE still had not downloaded the site after almost five minutes. A visit a day later though, showed no problem for IE.\nHowever, interestingly enough,  IE executes Java applets faster than Navigator. (Java will be touched on shortly). This is something I had noticed independently, and other tests have proven this. Both browsers contain JIT (Just-in-time) Java compilers to significantly speed Java's executions (Santalesa 1996).  The Pendragon Software Corp's CaffeineMark Industry standard testing  on Java show IE 's execution of Java applets anywhere from 13 percent to 50 percent faster than Navigator 3.0 on almost every test. The complete test result are available at\nOther sites that posed a problem for IE included sites using JavaScript. Even though IE claims to support JavaScript, this isn't entirely true. JavaScript is not the same as Java - JavaScript is geared for scripting strictly within a browser environment, while Java applets are separate programs which run in browsers. This confuses many - while IE supports Java (IE 3.0 at first had some problems with Java execution due to some missing class files - IE 3.01 has corrected that. More information can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/java/issue.htm) fully, and even executes applets faster, IE's JavaScript support is severely lacking.\nIE's lack of JavaScript support will not always be obvious to the general user, as many times the JavaScript includes code to ignore a browser that does not support most JavaScript functions, usually any browser other than Navigator 3.0. In fact, I discovered this problem not by testing sites, but by my own inclusion of JavaScript in some web pages. I always test web pages with both IE and Navigator, to ensure people using either browser can view the site. IE would produce an error when encountering the JavaScript. IE supports only  very basic JavaScript, and causes  an error in most of the very useful and widely used JavaScripts. Implementing a browser detection JavaScript is very simple, and many helpful JavaScripts such as this can be found at The JavaScript tip of the week.\nHowever, IE does  support a different scripting language - VBScript, which is an offshoot of Microsoft's Visual Basic. This makes scripting in a browser much easier for those who already know Visual Basic. VBScripts can also call ActiveX controls, which are considered a rival for Java applets (Thompson, 1996). Microsoft has also made it possible to control Java applets through ActiveX.\nNavigator also now includes LiveConnect, that allows the \"live\" objects of Java applets, JavaScripts, and plug-ins to interact with one another. In addition, Sun Microsystems, the creator of Java, has developed JavaBeans. JavaBeans allows Java components to be inserted in any other component or architecture, including ActiveX, OpenDoc, LiveConnect, and any Java applet or Application (Sun Developer News, 1996).\nDynamic Updating\nIf you've ever seen a \"live camera\" on the Web, where a scene is continually refreshed every few seconds, somewhat like a video, then you've seen an example of dynamic updating. Dynamic updating documents contain information that is updated on a periodic or frequent basis, and does not need any special plug-in or browser add-on to work. This allows web developers to provide almost real-time video feed right on a web site. The user does not have to refresh the page to see the updates - it's done automatically every two or three seconds. An example of this feature can be seen at InterStat, Inc's web site, where an \"office cam\" let's people view the activities in InterStat's office.\nNetscape 1.1 and above supports a couple different mechanisms for these dynamic documents. These mechanisms are called \"server push\" and \"client pull\", and are based on existing standards (including the standard MIME multipart mechanism and the HTML 3.0 META tag).\nIE, however, does not support this basic and  useful server-push function. While IE does have some support for refreshing videos, the user must reload his/her page every time the he/she wants to see an update. The above example will not work in IE.\nMultimedia Plug-ins\nPlug-ins are the way browsers handle multimedia Web content, such as video, music and VRML.\nNavigator and IE both support plug-ins, though the approaches for acquiring the plug-ins are a bit different. Navigator uses something called Automatic Update, which gives users access to new plug-ins whenever  they need them.  With Automatic Update, when one encounters a new data type, Navigator checks to see if  there is a plug-in that can display it. If the plug-in is already available on the system, Navigator automatically displays the data. If one doesn't have\nan appropriate plug-in, Navigator displays a dialog box asking if users if they would like to locate one.  The dialog box can be dismissed and users  can continue reading the page, or they can have Navigator display a list of plug-ins and the new data type encountered. That list links directly to the download page for each plug-in. After downloading, the data type that needed the plug-in will work.\nIE also checks for needed plug-ins when encountering a new data types. However, IE has streamlined the process a bit more by letting built ActiveX controls automatically recognize and display the data type. If  a plug-in is necessary, IE will automatically find the appropriate plug-in and ask users if they want to download and install the plug-in (PC Direct, 1996). Again, the users can choose not to accept the plug-in, but if they do, IE will download and install the plug-in. This eliminates users first being sent to the plug-in site, then downloading and installing the plug-in themselves. IE will automatically choose the plug-in and install it in one process, a big advantage for some users. For an advanced user who may more control and choice in the plug-in process, it may seem somewhat limited.\nConfused enough by the talk of JavaScript, Java, VBScript, and ActiveX? Let's look into Java and ActiveX a bit more.\nJava vs. ActiveX\nThis background on the two companys' different approaches to building computer infrastructures is important in understanding the differences between Java and ActiveX. An entire paper could be written just on Java and ActiveX, thus the information here regarding these two technologies is just a very brief overview. For a full understanding of Java or ActiveX, one should really acquire a more detailed document or book on the subject. This overview will however, present the basic differences between Java and ActiveX, and will tie in the reasons behind some of the differences of Navigator and IE. The differences between Microsoft's ActiveX and Sun Microsystem's Java (Netscape has adopted Java for Navigator, though Netscape did not create Java), will also show the different plans Microsoft and Netscape have for desktop computing. (Yes - this will finally be explained!)\nSun Microsystems, the developers of Java, built its business on network-centric computing, where a system's usability is determined more by the network resources it can access than by the particular operating system or the set of applications residing on it (Sun Developer News, 1996). As David Schickel, technical manager for Netscape Northern Europe states, \"with Navigator, (implementing Java) the notion of a desktop simply goes away.\" (PC Direct, 1996). The ultimate goal of Sun's network-centric model, which has been embraced by Netscape, is to provide the capabilities and capacities of the entire network to any computing device which can connect to it (Sun Developer News, 1996).\nJava is a programming language that is designed specifically for the Internet, and is an object-oriented programming tool. Java allows any program written in Java to run on any computer or digital device, from PCs to machine tools, so millions of otherwise incompatible computers can all use the same Java software. One prompt to develop Java is the Open Systems movement, which demands that different products work together, or interoperate.\nThe vision for Java lies within its compact applets, many taking up less than 100,000 bytes, that will do a single job well. If a user wants another feature - such as a spell check, or a graphic chart - the user can simply click and fetch another applet, which downloads in a few seconds. Java offers the user the prospect of a virtually infinite supply of just-in-time software-passing the burden of storing it to the network (Economist, 1995).\nSun and Netscape believe the focus of the Internet and corporate intranets is on new, network-centric applications, rather than the operating system of PC itself.\nActiveX is a direct descendent of Microsoft's OCX control that, in turn, is based on its Common Object Model (COM). ActiveX is used to develop content for web pages, and the ActiveX components, or scaled down OLE objects as most programmers will recognize them, can run in web pages, as well as part of any Windows based tools, such as C/C++, Basic, and Pascal. There are a few thousand components now available, ranging from simple push-button designs to complex multimedia objects (PC Direct, 1996). In a nutshell, ActiveX is simply existing desktop Microsoft tools and technologies bundled together and made to work over the Internet (Thompson, 1996). In fact, ActiveX controls don't need a browser, since they can be any sort of OLE control, and some controls are being built to work with other Windows applications such as word processors and spreadsheets. The controls are distributed over the Internet, installed via the browser, and are available to any program (Thompson, 1996). Some ActiveX examples are available at http://www.microsoft.com/activex/default.htm\nMicrosoft's view is desktop-centric, focusing  on the desktop, with operating systems and applications. ActiveX is Microsoft's method for wrapping the Internet into everything within Windows, and is excellent for integrating Windows-only, desktop-only applications (Santalesa, 1996).\nActiveX and Java - Platform Support\nA significant difference between ActiveX and Java lies in platform dependence. The difference in platform support parallels that of Navigator and IE. ActiveX is platform dependent, while Java is platform independent and will run on multiple platforms, including Macintosh, 12 of the more well-known  versions of Unix, Windows '95 and NT, and adheres to accepted industry standards. Java applications can run on multiple platforms without the need to be recompiled. This architecturally neutral characteristic of Java and Java's run-time environment are the main reasons why a Java program is portable. Simply put, this means one source, multiple platforms.\nActiveX controls have to be recompiled to run on any platform other than Windows, as ActiveX controls include Windows/Intel specific codes. So, existing ActiveX controls will have to be recompiled, which is a significant undertaking if Internet Explorer ever becomes available for other platforms. Therefore, multiple copies of each ActiveX control must be kept for each browser platform. (Thompson, 1996). ActiveX is absolutely not platform independent, and is not expected to be any time soon. ActiveX is restricted to people using Microsoft Windows using Internet explorer, or Navigator on Microsoft Windows with the ActiveX plug-in. Navigator 3.0 is supposed to run OLE/ActiveX controls today via Navigator's plug-in architecture and the nCompass plug-in.\nThis is not completely accurate. While the Navigator plug-in will run many ActiveX controls, I found that it did not work for some ActiveX features on the Microsoft Web Site . One in particular was an example of IE's streaming audio and video capabilities at http://www.microsoft.com/ie/most/howto/media.htm. Streaming allows the viewer to hear or see a multimedia file before it finishes downloading. Navigator also has plug-ins to support such streaming features, yet if one attempts to view these particular  multimedia streaming examples, it looks as if Navigator does not work, and thus does not support multimedia streaming well.\nUpon exploring the code for the files, it was found that the multimedia files are called by a VBScript, which calls an ActiveX control. This actually showed that Navigator does not completely support ActiveX. However, Navigator does supports streaming, as does IE. Even running Windows '95 with the ActiveX plug-in installed, the files could not be played or downloaded. This is not the norm, as integrating a VBScript to play sound or run video over the Web is not necessary.\nSecurity\nSecurity is integrated, or \"built-in\" in Java. Java applications are secure against both intentional and accidental system integrity attacks, with a combination of code verification and data flow analysis launched with all Java applications. (Coffee, 1996). All applets run in a protected space that prohibits access to local memory. Encryption and certification can also be used in conjunction with the applets (Sun Developer News, 1996).\nActiveX's security features were added on, and offers cryptology certificates as the only security measure. This method essentially encrypts the program and passes it through a certification site. Unfortunately, this is a significantly less comprehensive and secure method than any of those built into Java. It merely verifies that the ActiveX component has been created by the person who purchased the verification certificate, but it does not guarantee the quality of the component (Green, 1996). Because of its basis on desktop technology, ActiveX allows access to areas inherently vulnerable to viruses.\nRemember the slow connecting and web page download time at the Intel site, described earlier? Part of that was due to the downloading of the security certificate and 2 MB ActiveX HTML layout Control if the IE browser needs them. If  a PC lacks enough free disk space to install the layout control, it will redownload with every access (Santalesa, 1996).\nMicrosoft's  desktop-centric view, and Netscape's network-centric view are highly different.\nMicrosoft plans to integrate the browser with the operating system. IE 4.0 will mark the full crossover from the browser as an application to the browser as a navigational tool for the operating system. IE 4.0 will provide a common interface to the hard drive, the Lan, and the Internet. (PC Direct, 1996). Users will be able to manipulate applications such as Word and Excel within the IE 4.0 shell, and take advantage of ShellViews - framed areas within applications that can host active documents, regardless of their source. This means that users can view HTML content, wherever it's stored, as an inherent part of the application (PC Direct, 1996).\nNetscape's plans for Netscape Navigator and the desktop computer are much different. Netscape sees the browser as a mini-desktop within itself, which will be seen more in Navigator 4.0, as it adds more and more functionality to the browser, with the entire Navigator interface written in Java in the next six to eight months (Sun Developer News, 1996). Netscape hopes to see the browser used to navigate between local and Internet files seamlessly, while online and disconnected. To see examples of applications running in a Web browser, Cooper-Peters Inc. has some excellent examples at http://www.cooper-peters.com/. Here one can see wordprocessors and other applications running on a web browser - without the application residing on the local computer.\nActiveX controls run in container applications that are too fat to run on anything but the desktop, (Thompson, 1996). If Sun and Netscape's vision of \"The Network is the Computer\" becomes reality, ActiveX will have problems, as it will have no heavy operating system to rely on.\nWhich view will win? Again, that won't be known until version 4.0 of Navigator and Internet Explorer are available. Then the real browser wars will begin.\nMY Conclusions!\nSo how does one wade through all this information? So who wins the \"Browser Wars?\" The consumer. Compare the browsers of today with the Mosaic of last year, or even the first versions of Navigator and Internet Explorer! In addition, the competition between Microsoft and Netscape gives each company the push to become better and faster. One can see though, that both browsers contain excellent features for effective and exciting Web browsing. One can also see that both Microsoft and Netscape see the future of computing quite different, with Microsoft's desktop-centric view and Netscape's alliance with Sun Microsystems with their network-centric view.\nRegarding Netscape, why they did not include a handy feature such as style sheets is not known. It also seems odd that Microsoft has surpassed them in the speed of Java applet execution. Also, support for ActiveX is not complete, though Netscape counters that ActiveX solutions only work on TWO of Netscape's 16 supported operating systems, and the lack of protection in ActiveX is something Netscape can do without. I tend to agree. ActiveX is extremely insecure, and is useless for the many people who prefer to use the fourteen platforms that Microsoft doesn't bother to support\nThe lack of platform support in Internet Explorer, while many articles brush aside the issue, is a very important lacking feature on Microsoft's part. While, yes, most PC users may use  Windows '95 , the ignoring of Unix and other platforms is, in my opinion, very short-sighted. And what about OS/2? I.E didn't even support Windows 3.1 until very recently. Netscape supported Windows 3.1, a  Microsoft operating system, before Microsoft did! And while Microsoft claims they can provide the ActiveX functionality to all platforms, this seems very unlikely. ActiveX is really a part of the Windows platform - to say it will be just as effective on Unix and Macintosh may not be entirely true. In addition, as new computing architectures become available, every ActiveX control will have to be ported to the new platform. In contrast, Java is completely platform-independent, and Java components will run without recompilation on existing and future platforms that support Java. ActiveX is  useful for Windows platforms, but is not the \"next Java\" as some ActiveX supporters claim. In addition ActiveX's complete lack of security features makes the user vulnerable to every hacker on the Internet.\nWhen deciding on which browser is \"better\" a lot depends on personal opinion. For the novice user running Windows '95, Internet Explorer, with the easier plug-in function and more user-friendly interface would perhaps be a better choice. However, in my personal opinion, while Navigator may not be as \"pretty\" as IE, and does not include the Cascading Style Sheet feature, it's cross-platform support, downloading speed, JavaScript support, server-push dynamic document support, automatic update plug-in feature (I like choosing my own plug-ins), and most importantly, it's much higher level of security features makes it the best choice. Yet, for the best web browsing experience, I urge people to download BOTH browsers. Whether Web pages will one day work on all browsers is unknown, but for now, some pages will not work on either IE or Navigator, thus, downloading both cannot hurt. Actually using the browsers is also the best way to really decide which browser is best for YOU.\nSo, will 1997 prove to be the year the Windows becomes the way of computing, with a browser tightly integrated into the desktop? Or will the network-centric, open system and platform independent world of Sun and Netscape prevail? We may know when Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape 4.0 arrive. It's certainly something to watch.\nBusler, J. (1996, October 4). Battle of the Browsers. The Courier Post, pp. C4.\nCataldo, B. (1996, July). Netscape Delivers New Navigator.

A simple way to stop webpages from loading, and to stop       a plethora of pop ups from appearing, is to press Escape (Esc).       Essentially, this is the same as pressing the infamous stop button which       is characteristic of all web browsers, but much easier to do when being       flooded with aggravating pop ups.\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer 7.0 now in public beta testing.
