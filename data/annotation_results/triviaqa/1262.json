In 1894 women in South Australia were granted the vote and also the right to stand for parliamentary elections. In 1899 women in Western Australia were enfranchised.\nIn 1902 the Commonwealth Franchise Act gave all white women in Australia the vote and the right to stand for election to the Australian Federal Parliament. Aboriginal women in Australia, as well as aboriginal men, did not receive the vote until 1962.\nIn Europe the Nordic countries were pioneers in women’s suffrage. The first European nation to give women the vote was Finland in 1906. Women in the Grand Duchy of Finland, then an autonomous part of the Russian Empire, won the right to be elected members of the eduskunta, the Finnish unicameral parliament, in 1907.\nWomen in Norway received the right in 1913 with Denmark following in 1915. Other Nordic countries, such as Sweden, enfranchised women between 1919 and 1921, women in that country receiving the vote at least a year later than enfranchisement of Irish and English women over the age of 30. The end of the first World War was an important time for the enfranchisement of women in many European nations. Austria, Germany, Poland and Russia granted the vote to women in 1918 with the Netherlands following in 1919. Spanish women received the vote in 1931. However, there were certain countries in Europe in which women did not gain the vote until during or after the second World War. In 1944 French women received the right to vote. In 1945 Italy followed suit. Other European countries were even later to grant women suffrage; Switzerland did not grant the right until 1971 and Portugal not until 1976.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCanadian women, with the exception of Canadian Indians, received the vote in 1917. The latter were not enfranchised until 1960. In the United States women’s suffrage was granted on a local and state level from the late 19th century. In 1920 the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution stated that the right to vote of all citizens could not be denied by the US or any state within on the basis of sex.\nElsewhere, Mexico, Pakistan, Japan and Argentina granted female suffrage in 1947. China granted the right two years later in 1949 and India in 1950. Examples of countries in which women have only recently been granted the right to vote are South Africa (black women, 1994), Kuwait (2005) and the United Arab Emirates (2006). Women in Saudi Arabia will not have the vote until 2015.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n... founded the first women's suffrage ...

History of Women's Suffrage | Scholastic.com History of Women's Suffrage | Scholastic.com\nWomen's Suffrage\nFrom Grolier\nThe struggle to achieve equal rights for women  is often thought to have begun, in the English-speaking world, with the  publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). During the 19th century, as male suffrage was gradually  extended in many countries, women became increasingly active in the  quest for their own suffrage. Not until 1893, however, in New Zealand,  did women achieve suffrage on the national level. Australia followed in  1902, but American, British, and Canadian women did not win the same  rights until the end of World War I.\nThe United States\nThe demand for the enfranchisement of American women was first  seriously formulated at the Seneca Falls Convention (1848). After the  Civil War, agitation by women for the ballot became increasingly  vociferous. In 1869, however, a rift developed among feminists over the  proposed 15th Amendment, which gave the vote to black men. Susan B.  Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and others refused to endorse the  amendment because it did not give women the ballot. Other suffragists,  however, including Lucy Stone and Julia Ward Howe, argued that once the  black man was enfranchised, women would achieve their goal. As a result  of the conflict, two organizations emerged. Stanton and Anthony formed  the National Woman Suffrage Association to work for suffrage on the  federal level and to press for more extensive institutional changes,  such as the granting of property rights to married women. Stone created  the American Woman Suffrage Association, which aimed to secure the  ballot through state legislation. In 1890 the two groups united under  the name National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). In the  same year Wyoming entered the Union, becoming the first state with  general women's suffrage (which it had adopted as a territory in 1869).\nAs  the pioneer suffragists began to withdraw from the movement because of  age, younger women assumed leadership roles. One of the most  politically astute was Carrie Chapman Catt, who was named president of  NAWSA in 1915. Another prominent suffragist was Alice Paul. Forced to  resign from NAWSA because of her insistence on the use of militant  direct-action tactics, Paul organized the National Woman's Party, which  used such strategies as mass marches and hunger strikes. Perseverance  on the part of both organizations eventually led to victory. On August  26, 1920, the 19th Amendment granted the ballot to American women.\nGreat Britain\nIn Great Britain the cause began to attract attention when the  philosopher John Stuart Mill presented a petition in Parliament calling  for inclusion of women's suffrage in the Reform Act of 1867. In the  same year Lydia Becker (1827 –90) founded the first women's suffrage  committee, in Manchester. Other committees were quickly formed, and in  1897 they united as the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies,  with Millicent Garret Fawcett (1847 –1929) as president. Like their  American counterparts, the British suffragists struggled to overcome  traditional values and prejudices. Frustrated by the prevailing social  and political stalemate, some women became more militant. Emmeline  Pankhurst, assisted by her daughters Christabel and Sylvia, founded   the Women's Social and Political Union in 1903. Her followers, called  \"suffragettes,\" heckled politicians, practiced civil disobedience, and  were frequently arrested for inciting riots. When World War I started,  the proponents of women's suffrage ceased their activities and  supported the war effort. In February 1918 women over the age of 30  received the right to vote. Suffrage rights for men and women were  equalized in 1928.\nOther Countries\nEuropean countries such as Finland (1906), Norway (1913), and Denmark  and Iceland (1915) granted women the vote early in the 20th century.  Other continental powers were quick to accord women the right to vote  at the end of World War I. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and  the Netherlands granted suffrage in 1917; Austria, Czechoslovakia,  Poland, and Sweden in 1918; and Germany and Luxembourg in 1919. Spain  extended the ballot to women in 1931, but France waited until 1944 and  Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Yugoslavia until 1946. Switzerland finally  gave women the vote in 1971, and women remained disenfranchised in  Liechtenstein until 1984.\nIn  Canada women won the vote in Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan in  1916; after federal suffrage was achieved in 1918, the other provinces  followed suit, the last being Quebec in 1940. Among the Latin American  countries, national women's suffrage was granted in 1929 in Ecuador,  1932 in Brazil, 1939 in El Salvador, 1942 in the Dominican Republic,  1945 in Guatemala, and 1946 in Argentina. In India during the period of  British rule, women were enfranchised on the same terms as men under  the Government of India Act of 1935; following independence, the Indian  Constitution, adopted in 1949 and inaugurated in 1950, established  adult suffrage. In the Philippines women received the vote in 1937, in  Japan in 1945, in China in 1947, and in Indonesia in 1955. In African  countries men and women have generally received the vote at the same  time, as in Liberia (1947), Uganda (1958), and Nigeria (1960). In many  Middle Eastern countries universal suffrage was acquired after World  War II. In some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, there is no suffrage  at all, and in others, such as Kuwait, it is very limited and excludes  women completely.\nBibliography: Buechler, S.

European women ... Context :: European History - Digital History Reader Context :: European History\nEuropean History\nModule 02: Should Women Vote? The Politics of Suffrage\nContext\nDe Gouges and Wollstonecraft\nThe notions of citizenship that emerged during the French Revolution of 1789 strongly influenced the subsequent women's suffrage movement in Europe. The radical ideology of the French revolutionaries was founded on the beliefs that all people shared common rights, that the government should be accountable to the people, and that all citizens had both the right and the obligation to participate in government. While most revolutionaries assumed that only men could and should be citizens, two  documents emerged that would influence later arguments for women's suffrage. In France, Olympe de Gouges published her \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and Citizen,\" which rewrote the main document of the 1789 revolution, \"A Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen.\" Drawing on the republican language of rights and citizenship, de Gouges argued that women should have the same rights as men: to vote, to serve in the military, to marry and divorce, and to seek an education. In the same vein, Mary Wollstonecraft, an important participant in English radical circles, declared in her 1792 text, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, that granting additional rights to women would, in fact, improve society by turning women into equal participants in all aspects of life.\nNationalism, Socialism, and Liberalism\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, relatively little changed  in the field of women's rights in Europe, although other processes were preparing the way for the widespread efforts that came at the end of the century. The spread of nationalism, an ideology that defined individuals or communities by shared ethnicity, language, geography, culture, history, or political boundaries, further promoted the idea of citizenship as an essential right and obligation. While women were not considered equal participants in early nineteenth-century nations, the idea of affiliations based on family relations, shared values, and social place supported claims for women's involvement in nation-building efforts. By contrast, socialism based individual and collective identity on social class and economic status. While socialism's emphasis on class tended to divide women into opposing categories, the denunciation of oppression and inequality provided a further basis upon which the women's movement would later campaign. Liberalism, by contrast, upheld the notion of equality, opportunity, and rights for all, which offered women yet a third way to argue their claims for the right to vote. Just as liberalism promised the advancement of society as a whole with guaranteed rights and opportunities, advocates of women's suffrage would later argue for liberty and equality as promised to men. The three ideological positions — socialism, nationalism, and liberalism — paved the way for arguments both for and against women's suffrage in the late nineteenth century.\nThe Emergence of Campaigns for Women's Rights\nAlthough women's suffrage drew on common ideological positions, the distinct conditions of each country shaped campaigns for women's rights, the responses of  government and society, and the outcomes of the debates. In many European countries, such as Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Spain, rule by hereditary monarchs meant that neither men and women were allowed full democratic political rights. Women were granted limited rights as citizens, and many did become active in reformist or revolutionary movements. In the absence of democratic institutions and practices, however, the demand for women's suffrage was frequently ignored until basic political rights had been won for men. In other countries, such as Germany, Denmark, and Ireland, the struggle for national unity and independence involved a simultaneous assertion of participation in the political system. Politically active women supported the nationalist campaigns, with the expectation that proving their citizenship in the national struggle would lead to their being granted the right to vote. The earliest campaigns for women's rights emerged in countries such as England and France, where citizenship and voting had been firmly established as political rights for men (although with important distinctions by class, religion, and location). In such countries, women suffered exclusion and oppression based solely on their gender. Understanding the stages of the campaign for women's suffrage requires an appreciation of how the context of each struggle shaped both the tactics of the advocates and the responses of opponents.\nEarly Proponents and Opponents of Women's Rights\nAcross Europe, three distinct positions emerged regarding the question, Should women vote? Many advocates of women's suffrage, drawing predominantly on liberal notions of individual rights and democratic citizenship, argued that women shared common interests with men and therefore deserved to be treated equally by the law and political system. Others advocated suffrage on the grounds that society and politics would improve with the inclusion of women's interests, such as responsibilities to the family, commitment to culture, and presumed support for peace. Opposition to women's suffrage emerged among those who believed that allowing women to vote would destabilize society, divert attention from more pressing concerns, or create precedents for even greater democracy. The three positions can thus be summed up as follows by their distinct responses to the question, Should women vote?:\nYes, because women were citizens, too, and thus merited the political and legal rights accorded to men;\nNo, because women's distinct interests would alter the proper political roles of men; or\nYes, because women's interests would promote changes in society that could lead to improvements in the future.\nBroader Reforms\nNot all women supported — and not all men opposed — the extension of voting rights. But it was women, and particularly a core of activist women, who placed the issue on the agenda across Europe, mobilized support, and ultimately brought about such a fundamental transformation of European politics. While this module centers on the question of women's right to vote, it is important to recognize that the suffrage campaign built upon other campaigns for women's rights, including legal reforms to secure additional rights for women in marriage, educational reforms to provide more and better opportunities for young women, employment reforms to allow women to enter new professions, and social reforms that involved women in services such as public health, charities, and cultural activities.\nReform and Socioeconomic Status\nIn all cases, the reforms made important distinctions along socioeconomic lines, because the changes were supported and designed primarily to serve the interests of middle- and upper-class women. Expanding educational opportunities, for example, primarily served the interests of young women whose families could afford to send them to school and who would be more likely to enter professions, whereas lower-class women would derive little benefit from such changes. Even charitable activities and social reforms, such as campaigns against prostitution or efforts to improve city sanitation, were aimed more at protecting middle- and upper-class women and their families from the lower classes than  about improving the lives of lower-class women.\nClass and the Right to Vote\nThe issue of class was thus closely connected to the question of women's suffrage. Many European countries continued to restrict voting by socioeconomic status as well as by gender. Yet some proponents of women's suffrage argued that extending the vote to middle- and upper-class women would, in fact, strengthen the subordinate position of the lower classes. Some opponents of women's suffrage, by contrast, argued that any broadening of the vote would begin a process of democratization that would undermine the system of class differences. Finally, political radicals believed that enfranchising women would bring about meaningful change, since women were considered more sympathetic to the idea of incorporating other subordinate groups into the political system. The debate surrounding whether women should vote thus revolved around questions of class.\nFrance\nWhile many feminists viewed the French Revolution as a key event in the establishment of the notions of citizenship and women's rights, the political instability of the nineteenth century in France created real difficulties for those advocating women's suffrage. Revolutions in 1848 and 1870 led to uncertainty and conflict, which conservatives blamed partly on the social disorder associated with demands for women's rights. The women's movement in France responded by asserting that women's distinct interests and contributions could improve society if women were more integrated into the political and civil worlds. In the context of the nineteenth-century debate in France, advocates of reform argued that women naturally had a strong commitment to peace, both domestically and internationally, that would support France's efforts to develop internal unity and maintain a balance of power in Europe. Proponents of reform also declared that women had more compassion for the poor, while their role in reproduction was committed to the promotion of national interests by raising a new generation of Frenchmen. The feminist Hubertine Auclert became one of the leading voices of the \"difference\" campaign in support of women's suffrage during the 1880s and 1890s. Although she initially shared the moderate views of most French suffrage organizations, by the early 1900s she engaged in more radical kinds of direct action.\nGermany\nIn Germany, where elected representatives had more limited powers, supporters of women's rights were more sharply divided among  socialist, liberal, and nationalist ideologies. Women's organizations first appeared in Germany in the 1860s, but for years their efforts focused more on educational, civic, and charitable activities than on political or legal reforms. The German Social Democratic Party, the largest in Europe, supported women's suffrage, but distrusted the motives of middle-class feminists who sought to reform, rather than overturn, the existing political system. Moderate feminists in Germany thus found themselves isolated between prevailing conservative and nationalist values and the distrust of radicals who were the strongest advocates of change. In the decade before the outbreak of war, the resurgence of nationalism in Germany put the suffrage movement even more on the defensive. The combination of conservative politics and nationalist sentiments made it extremely difficult to advocate any reforms that seemed to divide Germans or threaten the link between family and nation.\nRussia\nIn Russia, radical movements shared a commitment to women's equal participation in the utopian societies of the future. Many young women were actively involved in campaigns against the autocracy during the 1880s and 1890s, but in the absence of any meaningful system of political participation, demands for women's suffrage were given relatively low priority. In 1881, one of these radical women, Sofia Perovskaia, was executed for her involvement in the assassination of Tsar Alexander II. During the early 1900s, however, a Russian feminist movement emerged actively campaigning for women's participation in a reformed political system. The concessions made by Tsar Nicholas II after the 1905 Revolution established a new constitutional system, yet women were still excluded from politics. Women's organizations continued their campaigns for voting and other rights within the existing system, but many supporters of women's suffrage looked to more radical movements, especially the socialist parties, for the wholesale changes needed to establish a more democratic political system that would guarantee women's right to vote.\nScandinavia\nThe Scandinavian countries were the first to grant women's suffrage in Europe. In these countries, nationalism evolved in ways that were more inclusive, while moderate political systems allowed for a more gradual process of change. Women earned the right to vote in Finland in 1906, Norwegian women began voting in national elections in 1913, and women's suffrage was granted in Iceland and Denmark in 1915. Women's suffrage movements may have been more visible and assertive elsewhere in Europe, but the first countries to grant women the right to vote were  Scandinavian.\nSouthern and Eastern Europe\nBy contrast, opposition to women's suffrage remained strongest in southern and eastern Europe, such as in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, where the Catholic influence on politics exerted a conservative influence over the question of women's rights. Liberals in southern and eastern Europe argued that, if women were more influenced by priests, granting them the right to vote would actually strengthen conservative forces within the political system. These countries, however, still figured among the last in Europe to grant women full voting rights.\nBritain\nIn Britain, a series of parliamentary reform bills between 1832 and 1911 extended the right to vote to more and more men, and thus encouraged women to think that they, too, would be granted suffrage. As early as the 1820s, women followed the earlier example of Mary Wollstonecraft in arguing for more rights for women. The emergence of the women's rights movement in the United States in the 1840s provoked further activism on the part of British women and like-minded men. In the 1860s, the liberal thinker and feminist sympathizer John Stuart Mill first presented a women's franchise bill to Parliament, but the bill failed to secure sufficient votes. Mill's advocacy of women's rights demonstrates that the issue earned support from men as well as women who shared a desire to broaden participation in the political system. During the following decades, social reforms aimed at education, employment, and health served both to extend rights to more women and to further underscore how women were being excluded from the evolving definition of citizenship. As women earned the right to participate in public activities, such as leading charitable and professional organizations or voting in school board elections, their participation locally became  grounds for demands for further enfranchisement.\nSuffrage and Imperialism\nIn Britain as in other European countries, the debate surrounding women's suffrage also involved the question of imperialism. While proponents of suffrage argued that granting more rights to women was further proof of European cultural superiority, especially when compared to the \"oppression\" of women in other cultures, opponents of women's suffrage argued that European power depended on the perpetuation of women's primary roles as wives and mothers. The debate thus took place against a backdrop of expanding European oppression of men and women in other regions, particularly in Africa, India, and Southeast Asia.\nThe Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU)\nBy the 1880s, women's suffrage associations increasingly focused on persuading the main political parties that extending the right to vote to women was a necessary and logical continuation of previous reform efforts. In 1896, the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), under the direction of Millicent Garrett Fawcett, was formed to draw together different organizations with similar objectives. The movement's liberal position argued that, by proving themselves to be responsible and active citizens in a pluralist society, women would earn the right to vote from men who recognized their valuable contributions to the general welfare. A more militant group within the suffrage movement emerged in the early 1900s under the leadership of Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, Christable and Sylvia, the founders of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Arguing that direct action was the only way to bring about political change, the WSPU engaged in direct tactics, such as heckling speakers during political rallies, mass parades, chaining themselves to the gates of Parliament, smashing windows, setting postal boxes on fire, and vandalizing golf courses. Imprisoned suffragettes went on hunger strikes and were force-fed in brutal and humiliating ways until the government adopted the so-called \"cat and mouse\" rules, which meant that hunger strikers were released from prison, and then rearrested after they had recovered. The single most spectacular protest by a suffragette came in 1913, when Emily Wilding Davison ran onto a racetrack and was killed by horses running in Derby Day. WSPU militancy brought public attention to the question of suffrage, but many supporters came to believe that such tactics alienated moderates and strengthened opponents, which further postponed any kind of political reform.\nThe Extension of the Right to Vote to Women\nEuropean women finally earned the right to vote, although in ways and at times quite different from the trajectories and campaigns of most suffrage movements. As mentioned above, the Scandinavian countries of Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland were the first, and only, European countries to grant women the right to vote before the outbreak of war in 1914. In Russia, women earned the right to vote during the 1917 Revolution, when liberals and socialists collaborated in democratizing the political system. The right to vote continued in the Soviet era, even as other democratic reforms were eliminated. British women were granted the right to vote in parliamentary elections in 1918. Campaigns by suffrage advocates and recognition of women's important contributions during the war finally overcame opposition. In Germany and Austria, both defeated powers, the postwar settlements included women's suffrage. The Weimar constitution of 1919 granted women the right to vote, which would make them an important constituency of the factionalized political parties that shaped the interwar period. Other countries that granted women the right to vote after the war included the United States (1919), Poland (1921), and Spain (1931).\nFrance and Women's Suffrage\nYet in France, the country whose revolution had first connected notions of citizenship with women's rights, it would be another two decades — at the end of yet another war — before the government of liberated France finally took the step. In 1944, more than 150 years after Olympe de Gouges and Mary Wollstonecraft sought to include women in the political revolution launched by the \"Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen,\" French women had finally won the right to vote, thus bringing to an end the women's suffrage campaign in European history.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\n...

Women's Suffrage Movement | HistoryNet Close\nWomen’s Suffrage Movement\nFacts, information and articles about Women’s Suffrage Movement, the struggle for the right of women to vote\nWomen’s Suffrage summary: The women’s suffrage movement (aka woman suffrage) was the struggle for the right of women to vote and run for office and is part of the overall women’s rights movement. In the mid-19th century, women in several countries—most notably, the U.S. and Britain—formed organizations to fight for suffrage. In 1888, the first international women’s rights organization formed, the International Council of Women (ICW). Because the ICW was reluctant to focus on suffrage, in 1904 the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) was formed by British women’s rights activist Millicent Fawcett, American activist Carrie Chapman Catt, and other leading women’s rights activists.\nWomen’s Suffrage In Europe\nThe first country to grant national-level voting rights to women was the self-governing British colony of New Zealand, which passed the Electoral Bill in September 1893. The British colony of South Australia granted full suffrage in 1894, giving women the right to vote and to stand for parliament. Australia federated in 1901 and country-wide women’s suffrage followed quickly in 1902; however, women of Australia’s indigenous people were specifically excluded until 1949, when the right to vote in federal elections was granted to all indigenous people. Remaining restrictions were abolished in 1962.\nOther countries followed soon after New Zealand, with limited rights granted to women in Sweden, Britain, Finland, and some U.S. states by the early 20th century. When World War I began in 1914, many suffrage organizations shifted their focus to supporting the war effort, although some activists continued to fight for suffrage. Because of manpower shortages in warring countries, women took on many roles traditionally held by men and changed the dominant idea of what women were capable of doing, giving further momentum to the suffrage movement. Britain’s Parliament passed the Eligibility of Women Act in November 1918, which allowed women to be elected to Parliament. Ten years later, the Representation of the People Act granted women the right to vote. Following a path similar to Britain’s, many countries—Denmark, Iceland, the USSR, the Netherlands, Canada, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden, Germany, Luxembourg, the United States—had granted the vote to women by 1920.\nOther European countries did not grant women the right to vote until much later—Spain in 1931, France in 1944, and Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Yugoslavia in 1946. Later still were Switzerland (1971) and Liechtenstein (1984). In Latin America, national suffrage was granted to women between 1929 (Ecuador) and 1946 (Argentina). In Africa, the right to vote was generally conferred on both men and women as colonial rule ended and nations became independent—the same is true for India, which granted universal suffrage with its constitution in 1949. Middle Eastern countries granted women the right to vote after World War II, although some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, do not have suffrage at all or have limited suffrage and exclude women completely (Kuwait).\nWomen’s Suffrage In the United States\nThe suffrage movement in the United States gained prominence with the first women’s rights convention in the world: the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. The convention was organized by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton , active members of the abolitionist movement who met in England in 1840 at the World Anti-Slavery Convention. In 1851, Stanton was introduced by a mutual friend to Susan B. Anthony , who was most active in the temperance movement at the time. The two would form a life-long friendship and collaboration focused on obtaining suffrage. They formed the Woman’s National Loyal League in 1863 to support the Thirteenth Amendment to abolish slavery and to campaign for full citizenship for blacks and women.\nThe National Woman Suffrage Association\nIn 1869, with slavery abolished, a rift developed in the suffrage movement over how to gain suffrage. Anthony and Stanton founded the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and campaigned for a constitutional amendment for universal suffrage in America, and for other women’s rights, such as changes in divorce laws and an end to employment and pay discrimination. Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, and Josephine Ruffin formed the less-radical American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) to focus on obtaining suffrage for black men with the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and on winning women’s right to vote state-by-state, ignoring the broader rights the NWSA was campaigning for.\nBy the 1880s, it became clear that the two organizations would be more effective if they merged back into one group, so they formed the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1890, with Stanton as president and Anthony as vice president. Stanton’s position was largely honorary—she departed on a 2-year European speaking tour shortly after being elected, leaving Anthony as acting president. NAWSA was a national, parent organization to hundreds of local groups that campaigned solely for women’s right to vote. However, NAWSA alienated the more radical activists like Stanton, Matilda Joslyn Gage, and Olympia Brown who were campaigning for broader rights along with the right to vote.\n\n"
