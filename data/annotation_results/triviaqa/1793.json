Equilibrium is never actually attained; it is approximated by movements of the market.\nNote: Keynesian economics departed from conventional economic theory in demonstrating that economic equilibrium and full employment need not occur together. Therefore, as a system tends toward equilibrium, it might not eliminate unemployment.\nequilibrium definition\nA condition in which all influences acting cancel each other, so that a static or balanced situation results. In physics , equilibrium results from the cancellation of forces acting on an object. In chemistry , it occurs when chemical reactions are proceeding in such a way that the amount of each substance in a system remains the same.
