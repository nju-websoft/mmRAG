Mr. Bickley. Mr. Bickley, if you would, mumble, mumble, mumble...\nFranklin Delano Bickley :   With heavy heart, and mournful eyes, and tears that softly flow, we say our final sad goodbyes... to a fuzzy Escargot... Hogslop!\nExidor :   In this life, yes!\nExidor :   Mork, I have come here to preach the only true religion!\nMork :   What's the only true religion this time?\nExidor :   Reincarnation! We have all lived before and we shall all be born again!\nMork :   Wow, the ultimate deja vu!\nExidor :   In a previous life, I was a very famous person. Guess who!\nMork :   Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist party?\nExidor :   Just to meet girls!\nMork :   Are you currently in a Broadway show?\nMork :   I've got it! You're the editor of The National Enquirer!\nExidor :   He's not dead!\nMork :   You'll enjoy meeting my new friend, Bob.\nExidor :   You made friends with a fuzzy Tootsie Roll?\nMork :   No, Exidor, look! Look closer, it's a caterpillar!\nExidor :   Why, this is no ordinary caterpillar, Mork. This is the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln!\nMork :   No! How can you tell?\nExidor :   Is that the face of someone who would tolerate slavery?\nMork :   That's not her face.\nExidor :   Really? I thought she was smiling at me!\nMindy McConnell :   You know, Mork, between your friends and your pets, I sometimes wonder if you're an advanced alien being or just an intergalactic bozo.\nMork :   The answer is... Both!\nFranklin Delano Bickley :   You have a bug for a pet?\nMork :   Oh, yes. I pulled a thorn out of its paw and the other thirteen legs followed me home.\n[Mork's \"dead\" caterpillar has transformed into a butterfly]\nMindy McConnell :   Now I guess you probably believe what Exidor said about reincarnation, right?\nMork :   No, I still think Exidor had his head up his foot. But maybe he's right though. Maybe when you die, something beautiful happens.\nMork :   You should have heard the eulogy I did for my caterpillar. Mindy says that when he dies, he'll go to Heaven, and be with all the other bugs and he'll be very happy and everything will be beautiful.\nOrson :   Tell me, if Heaven is so beautiful, so perfect, so great, how come humans don't want to die?\nMork :   Who wants to be with all those bugs?\nOrson :   What do you think happens when something dies, Mork?\nMork :   I don't know, Sir. All I know is that when my caterpillar became a butterfly and sprouted wings and flew away, it looked kind of like a little angel.\nExidor :   Mork! I came over as soon as you called! What's wrong?\nMork :   Abraham Lincoln's dead again!\nMork :   It costs money to die?\nMr. Herman :   Only if you want to die decently.\nMork :   Bob died great!

And that's exactly what I'm gonna do! Keep her with me in my room!\nMr. Herman :   What would you like for an epitaph?\nMork :   Well, I could start out with some shrimp cocktail, have some expresso.\nMr. Herman :   No, I mean what would you like written on the headstone?\nMork :   Oh. \"Here lies Bob. She's Dead.\"\nMr. Bickley :   Nobody has a BUG for a pet!\nMork :   Are you kidding? Bob's clean, she's leaf-broken! And she's a skilled mime too!

Sticky fingers!\nMindy McConnell :   Mork, it can be against the law to go in somebody's apartment when they're not home, even if the door's not locked.\nMork :   Oh can you honestly say that since Watergate? Come on.\nFranklin Delano Bickley :  [finding Mork's age machine] What's this, some electronic noise maker?\nMork :   No, it's a sign language radio for deaf people.\n[sign language while singing]\nStephanie :   When do we eat?\nMork :   Stephanie, you just had lunch and very few people can eat a whole turkey and live.\n[regarding Stephanie's eating habits]\nMork :   Stephanie, if you keep this up, one day you're gonna go on an elevator and it's gonna say, \"Capacity: YOU!\"\nMork :   Kids, time for our field trip! Today we're gonna go down to that chemical plant by the river and watch the dead fish race!\nMork :   Now, Exidor is our friend.\nMindy McConnell :   Exidor is *your* friend, Mork. Ya know, quite a few people think he's a little strange.\nExidor :   I've heard those ugly rumors and they're grossly exaggerated! Do you have any chinchilla dip?\nMork :   Mind, you can come out now, Exidor's gone.\nMindy McConnell :   Exidor was *gone* when he got here!\nMork :   Some questions you can't answer, Billy, like how does Venus de Milo hitchhike?\nBilly :   Is it alright if I throw my bike in your jeep?\n\"Mork & Mindy: Skyflakes Keep Falling on My Head (#1.16)\" (1979)\nMork :   I'd like to take her to the dog star, Sirius.

Do you think I should observe him?\nCora Hudson :   Somebody should keep him under observation!\n[Exidor and his imaginary friends enter]\nExidor :   Step aside! Don't push! We can't all get through the door at the same time!\nExidor :   Mork, do you have any idea how old I am? Wrong! Next Wednesday afternoon, I'll be twelve years old.\nMork :   Whoa, you're awfully mature for your age.\nExidor :   Guilt without sex! That's the key!\nExidor :   I'm too old to stand on street corners preaching! I've got to settle down! Get a straight, conventional job.\nMork :   What do you think you'd like to be?\nExidor :   Emperor of the Earth!\nMork :   You have a summer home?\nExidor :   I bought it four years ago, when I was a doctor.\nMork :   You don't have any talent.\nExidor :   Well, that's never stopped any rock group before. Besides, you've never seen me perform! Mork, you wait right here, I'll get my axe!\nMindy McConnell :   Well, I can't believe we finally made it! I thought you were supposed to be such a trailblazer!\nMork :   Well, I made it from Ork to Earth but there were no trees.\nMork :   I wonder when we lost the trail.\nMindy McConnell :   I suspect it was right before we fell off the cliff.\nMork :   Well, I owe you an apology - next time you can land on me!\nMork :   I hope that beaver isn't hurt.\nMindy McConnell :   What was a beaver doing out strolling in the middle of the night, anyway?

Do you know how yucky it is to step on a beaver's tail?\nMork :   I didn't know those little suckers could scream!\n[Mork picks up a book]\nMork :   What's this? Confessions of a Schizophrenic by Exidor as told to Exidor.\nMork :   Please don't make me leave! I'll do anything! I'll shovel the dishes, I'll wash the snow! But don't make me go back upstairs to him! Ple-hease!\nMork :   Grub!\n[Eugene brings in a bundled Christmas tree]\nMork :   A tree in bondage? Eugene, you're weird. Why are you dragging this dead thing around?\n[Susan gives Mork a ceramic angel for the Christmas tree]\nMork :   Well, any friend of yours is a friend of ours, and your winged guest is welcome here. Fly, little friend, be free!\n[Mork tosses the angel in the air, it hits the floor and shatters]\nMork :   Oooh, heavy remorse! I've killed your flighty friend!\nMork :   At home, we used to make presents for people.\nEugene :   Sure, you can do that!\nMork :   I thought that's against the law! You know, because on TV they say you've gotta buy everything, it's part of the commercialization of Christmas!\nMindy McConnell :   Susan, we're gonna see that you have a really nice Christmas this year.\nMork :   Yes, we have presents, even for you.\n[Susan opens her Christmas gift]\nSusan Taylor :   Oh, yes! Why a saucer?\nMork :   Well, Mindy said you'd only appreciate something shallow.\n[Mindy opens her Christmas gift]\nMindy McConnell :   It's a bracelet!\nMork :   No, it's a lawnmower! Of course it's a bracelet! It's hand-made by Mork.\nMindy McConnell :   Well, it's really interesting. What kind of beads are these?\nMork :   Oh, they're not beads. I know you'll love it cuz there's a whole collection of 'em up in the attic. They're flies!\n[Mindy instantly drops the bracelet; Mork picks it up]\nMork :   They can't fly now, silly, they're dead! And look, I hand-painted each and every one of their eyes. Which was really a drag, took a long time. And I made little clothing for 'em right there, little pants. Oh, look! Look! His human's open! And if you look real close and you hold 'em up to the light, you can see I put sequins on the wings so they could look like Liza Minelli in Cabaret!\nFrederick McConnell :   Okay, so your presents weren't very practical, but it doesn't matter.\nMindy McConnell :   Oh Mork, dad's right. It's not the gift, it's the thought that counts.\nCora Hudson :   That's true, Mork, it is the thought.\nMork :   Thoughts are important?\nMindy McConnell :   Mork, are you here?\nMork :  [busts through the wallpaper] Here I am!\nMindy McConnell :   Mork, why did you wallpaper the door?\nMork :   Well I didn't want to stop, I was on a roll!\nFranklin Delano Bickley :   Let's be honest, an apartment is for wild young people, but an apartment is...\nMork :   For wild older people!\nJean DaVinci :  [Mork screams and runs under the table] I think something's troubling him.\nMindy McConnell :   Mork, will you come out?\n[Mork screams high pitched]\nMindy McConnell :   Mork, what's the matter?\nMork :   Oh nothing much, just that your house tried to attack me! That's all!\nMindy McConnell :   Oh come on, Mork, really!\nMork :   WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'COME ON REALLY'?\n[comes out from under the table]\nMork :   Mindy I'm telling you the truth! I was at the house and I was hanging wallpaper, and a wind BLEW in the air across the room! Then it got real cold! Then real hot! And then a swarm of bees came in! Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya! Then a swarm of flies! Zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip! And then I ran flamboyantly to the window screaming 'Ah-a-a-a-a-a-ah!' and it slammed shut! Then this is the terrifying part, I was standing there and the furniture started attacking me! Yes! A little ottoman, and an ottowoman too! They're coming at me! And the armchair couldn't keep its hands to itself! And a strange voice kept crying out 'GET out of HEEERE!' By the time it said 'here', I was HERE!\nMindy McConnell :   Have you been hitting the cream soda again?\nMork :   Mindy, you gotta believe me! You gotta believe me!\nMindy McConnell :   Believe you? What am I supposed to believe? That my house is haunted?\nMork :   Well it's either that or I've lost my mind.\n[laughs]\nMork :   Maybe you better call the police and ask them to look for a little gray squishy thing!\nJean DaVinci :   He could be right! You know there are case histories of haunted houses?\nMindy McConnell :  [takes sheet off antique rocker] See this chair?\n[Mork raises bat]\nMindy McConnell :   My mother did the needlepoint on this entire chair.\nMork :   That's beautiful, did she crochet this stain too?\nMindy McConnell :   And see these marks on the door? That was how tall I was each birthday from 2 to 13.\nMork :   We have the same thing on Ork except they tattoo it on the back of our head.\nMindy McConnell :   Do you see any flies? You see any bees?\nMork :   No but they were here last night.\nMindy McConnell :   Well bugs get in sometimes.\nMork :   Oh yeah, big suckers like that! How does that explain the furniture moving? The bees underneath going\n[mimes holding up furntiure, buzzing]\nJean DaVinci :  [opens book] Recognize this?\nMindy McConnell :   Yeah, it kind of looks like my house.\nJean DaVinci :   It is, in 1921. Only then it was known as Lafalette House.\nMindy McConnell :   Lafalette is my mother's maiden name.\nJean DaVinci :   Well, this book says two sisters built this home in 1894, Lucinda and Dedra Lafalette.\nMindy McConnell :   Lucinda and Dedra? They must've been my great, great aunts or something.\nJean DaVinci :   Well according to this, Lucinda was the older sister and she wasn't so attractive, but she was madly in love with this handsome young silver miner named Harrison Monteith; but he was in love with the young and beautiful Dedra. Then one night they found Harrison's body. He'd been mysteriously poisoned, but no one could prove who did it. After that, the sisters boarded themselves up in the house, and they were never seen again until the day they died.\nMindy McConnell :   Oh that's great, that happened in my house? That's terrific.\nJean DaVinci :   Well, it could be that Lucinda and Dedra don't want their house sold.\nMork :   I wonder what ghosts do when they're not busy scaring people.\n[hears toilet flush]\nMindy McConnell :   Well, what about you?\nMork :  [he gives a fake little laugh and deepens his voice] Me? The cosmic Charles Bronson?\nFranklin Delano Bickley :   I was blaming it on you, but it's time I faced it. I've lost it.\nMork :   Well, we can form a posse and find it, if you want!\nFranklin Delano Bickley :  [glares at him] No, it's no use. They say your sympathy is the first thing to go. I used to be able to get tears out of a coat rack. Not anymore. Listen to this: \"Your pet rabbit died / Poor little Muffet! / Your two choices are: / Eat it or stuff it.\"\n[Mork thinks a real rabbit has died]\nMork :   Aw, that's sad!\nMindy McConnell :   Mr. Bickley, you're just going through a writer's slump. Mork is leaving for good!\nFranklin Delano Bickley :   Look, sister, Little Muffet ain't coming back, either.\nMork :   Oh. None of us has a reason to be happy now.\nFranklin Delano Bickley :  [helping himself to their drinks] I'll drink to that.\n[Susan bursts through the door, all smiles]\nSusan :   Knock, knock, knock!\n[Her smile fades. Mork is slumped over, rubbing his ear. Mindy is slumped over, shading her eyes because of tears. Bickley is leaning on the counter, burying himself in a drink]\nSusan :   Well, what a group. Hear No Evil, See No Evil, and Feel No Pain. What's wrong with you people?\nFranklin Delano Bickley :   I drink fine by myself.\nSusan :   Oh, and Mork, I bet he could come up with something for you.\nMork :   Yeah. That sounds exciting. Come on, Mindy!\n[taking her hands and leaping up]\nMork :   Let's not poop the party!\nSusan :   This is Ellsworth!\n[Mork and Mindy stand up to shake hands, but Ellsworth ignores them]\nSusan :   Oh, Ellsworth, you know, we're so lucky to have a man like you, so unselfish - it's a special gift for...\nEllsworth :  [interrupting her with a huge smile] Yes, excuse me, excuse me. Could you hold that thought just a moment?\nSusan :  [almost swooning toward him] Ohh, yes.\n[Ellsworth, checkbook in hand, starts counting how many people are attending]\nEllsworth :   Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty. Twenty bodies, twenty checks! Okay, we're all set.\n[He puts his checkbook in his pocket]\nEllsworth :   Now, what were you saying?\nMork :   She was saying how nice it was that an unselfish man like you came all this way for a little thing like money!\n[Mork and Mindy look at menus]\nMindy McConnell :   Why don't you have The Businessman's Lunch?\nMork :   Why should I have it if he didn't?\nMindy McConnell :   How do you know my name?\nGeorge :   I make it my business to get acquainted with every fox in town.\nMork :   A good way to do that is to leave dead meat on your porch.\nGeorge :   This, I take it, is Merc.\nMork :   Oh no, that's a great car! My name Mork. Na-nu, Na-nu!\nMork :   I knew what pain was, but nobody ever told me it hurt.\nMork :   Mork from Ork has never been called a coward. I've never even lost a holitacker except for that one on Sirius, and how can you trust an eight-legged pekingese as an umpire?\nMork :   Bartender, spam for everybody!\nMork :   I'm trying to fit in here on Earth because these are a very violent, violent people.\nOrson :   You mean they have wars?\nMork :   Oh no, worse than that. Violence is part of their everyday lives. First of all, they *slash* prices, they *drown* their sorrows, they *punch* buttons and they kill time. I'm not even gonna tell you what they do to eggs.\nOrson :   I had no idea they were so vicious.\nMork :   Oh, not only that, they *blow up* photographs, they *hang* plants, and I heard one guy telling another guy, \"Hey man, you can crash at my place.\" And even when they're finished having a fight and they want to make up, they threaten to bury the hatchet!\nOrson :   What makes them so violent?\nMork :   I don't know. I think it starts when a baby is born. The first thing a doctor does is hit it. They don't stand a chance, your immenseness.\nMork :  [as a 3 year old, to a moose head] Moo Moo bit me! And then he came down and attacked my knee, BAD Moo Moo!\n[hits the moose and hurts his hand]\nMork :   Owwwwwwwhaaaaa!\nMindy McConnell :   I'm worried I just don't know what it would be like to have a child.\nMork :   And I'm sad, because I don't know what it'd be like to have a mother.\nMindy McConnell :   Well at least I've got a way of finding out.\nMork :   I've got a way we can both find out. I'll set my age machine for 3 years old, for 10 minutes, that way I'll be a baby, and you'll be my\n[age machine kicks in, high pitched voice]\nMork :   MAMA! Mommy hold me!\nMindy McConnell :   You must've fallen asleep while you were watching TV.\nMork :   If I was asleep, then the TV was watching me.\nMindy McConnell :   All night long, Dan just kept talking about babies, then I realized he never talked about us. He wasn't into having a wife so much as he wanted a family; and I want to be a couple before I'm a group.\nMork :   I'm sorry you lost your husband. Did my becoming a child affect your decision?\nMindy McConnell :   Well I have to admit it opened my eyes, it's hard to be a mother.\nMork :   Yeah, it's pretty tough being a kid too, but you made it easy. Know something?\n\"Mork & Mindy: Mork Meets Robin Williams (#3.14)\" (1981)\nMork :  [about Mindy] This is my brother, he likes to dress up a little, come on, Roland.\nMindy McConnell :   Excuse me, Mister Williams, but I have a big big big favor to ask of you. I know you don't know me and I don't want to impose, but I was supposed to get an interview with you for KTNS, and if I don't, I'll be fired.\nMork :   Yeah, and it's been a bad year for her, she bet on Carter, Roberto Duran, and she had to buy stock in Chrysler too.\nMindy McConnell :  [to Robin] You sure are a hard man to get in touch with.\nMork :   Yeah, you have tighter security than the Pope. A bullet couldn't get past your manager's security's security's security's answering machine.\nOrson:   I thought all stars were rich, live in mansions and drive big eggs.\nMork :   I know, sir, that's the common misconception. But you see to get that you have to pay a very heavy price: you have responsibilities, anxieties, and to tell you the truth, sir, some of them can't take it.\nOrson:   I'm not buying it, Mork.\nMork :   Why, sir?\nOrson:   It sounds to me like they have it made.\nMork :   Well, most of them do sir, but some are victims of their own fame, very special and talented people: people like Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe... Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Bruce, Freddie Prinze, and John Lennon.\n\"Mork & Mindy: Mork the Tolerant (#1.14)\" (1979)\nMork :   Dear Superman, I am writing you this letter because I'm really perturbed.

Don't you sweat a lot, wearing two suits?\n[Someone bangs from below the floor]\nMork :   Whoa, the mice must be taking steroids!\nMork :   Mindy, you Earthlings must learn some more virtues, like being more tolerant.

Mindy and Mork together call Orson to ask for help and an elder appears to reindoctrinate Mork into Orkan ... Mork and Mindy was a hit during the first ... Mork and Mindy - Mork and Mindy Wiki - Wikia Mork and Mindy | Mork and Mindy Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nEdit\nThe series was a spinoff of the sitcom Happy Days . The character of Mork ( Robin Williams ) first appeared in the Season 5 episode, \"My Favorite Orkan,\" where he threatened to take Richie Cunningham back to Ork as an example of a human , but his plan is foiled by Fonzie. The character proved to be popular enough with the audience to rate a starring role in a series, though in the series Mork would reside in Boulder Colorado , and in the (then) current day of 1978 as opposed to Happy Days' 1950s Milwaukee Wisconsin .\nMork's egg-shaped spacecraft lands on Earth, with his mission to observe human activity, assigned by Orson, his mostly-unseen and long-suffering superior (voiced by Ralph James), who has sent Mork to Earth to get Mork off Ork. To fit in, Mork dresses in a suit - but with the tie, shirt, and coat all on backwards. He befriends Mindy ( Pam Dawber ) after witnessing her and her boyfriend getting into an argument and him driving off in her vehicle, leaving her stranded. Mork offers assistance, and Mindy, not seeing his back or the on-backwards suit, assumes he's a priest judging simply by looking at him from the front, mistaking his wardrobe gaffe for a priest's collar. Mindy is taken in by Mork's willingness to listen (unknown to her, he's simply observing her behavior as part of his mission), and the two become friends. The two walk back to her apartment, when Mindy sees his backwards suit and Mork's rather unconventional behavior for a priest. She asks him who he really is, and the innocent Mork, having not learned how to lie, tells her the truth.\nAfter discovering Mork is an alien, Mindy promises to keep his true identity a secret and allows him to move into her attic . Complicating factors include Mindy's father, Fred ( Conrad Janis ), who expresses outrage that his daughter is living with a man. Fred's mother-in-law, Cora (Elizabeth Kerr), presents a much less conservative view, and approves of Mork and the living arrangement.\nMindy and Cora also worked at Fred's record store with Cora giving music lessons to a black pre-teenager, Eugene (Jeffrey Jacquet) when both are introduced—Cora's role in the series was limited to comic counter-points never carrying much plot development. Eugene, played an occasional plot role as a Mork confidant who gave views or advice which then created the conflict-resolution of the episode. Storylines usually centered on Mork's attempts to understand human behavior and American culture as Mindy helps him to adjust to life on Earth. At the end of each episode, Mork must report back to Orson on what he has learned about Earth . These end-of-show summaries allow Mork to comment humorously on social norms.\nMork's greeting was \" Nanu nanu \" (pronounced \"nah-noo nah-noo\", sometimes spelt Nanoo Nanoo) along with a hand gesture similar to Mr. Spock 's Vulcan salute from Star Trek combined with a handshake. It became a popular catchphrase at the time, as did \"Shazbot\" (SHOZZ-bot), an Orkan curse word that Mork used. Mork also said \"kay-o\" in place of okay.\nThis series was Robin Williams' first major acting break. It became famous for Williams' use of his manic improvisational comedic talent. Williams would make up so many jokes during filming that the scripts eventually had specific gaps where Williams was allowed to perform freely. In many scenes, Pam Dawber had to bite her lip to avoid laughing and ruining the filming.\nThe series was hugely popular in its first season. The Nielsen ratings were very high, ranking at #3 behind Laverne & Shirley (#1) and Three's Company (#2). The show even garnered higher ratings than the show that spawned it, Happy Days (#4). [1] [2] However, the network management sought to \"improve\" the show in several ways. This was done in conjunction with what is known in the industry as counterprogramming, a technique in which a successful show is moved opposite a ratings hit on another network. The show was moved from Thursdays, where it out rated CBS ' The Waltons, to Sundays, replacing Battlestar Galactica. The show now aired against two highly-rated shows: NBC 's anthology series The Sunday Big Event and CBS' Archie Bunker's Place, the revamped continuation of All in the Family.\nSecond season\nEdit\nThe second season saw an attempt to seek younger viewers. The characters of Fred, Cora and Eugene were effectively dropped, though Fred and Cora would both appear briefly in later episodes, including Fred's returning with a bride. It was explained on the show that Fred was sent off to tour as a conductor with an orchestra , and he took Cora with him on the road. Eugene was never mentioned again.\nNew cast members and a disco -like version of the first season's gentle theme tune were added. Among the new[supporting characters were Remo and Jean DaVinci ( Jay Thomas and Gina Hecht ), a brother and sister from New York City who owned a new neighborhood deli where Mork and Mindy now spent a lot of time. Also added as regulars were their grumpy neighbor Mr. Bickley (who ironically worked as a verse writer for a greeting-card company) portrayed by Tom Poston , (introduced in one episode of the first season), and, introduced a few episodes into the second season's run, Nelson Flavor (Jim Staahl), Mindy's snooty cousin who ran for city council.\nThe show's main focus was no longer on Mork's slapstick attempts to adjust to the new world he was in, but began to focus on the relationship between Mork and Mindy on a romantic level. The network execs also were rumored to have tried to get Pam Dawber to add \"jiggle\" by wearing padded bras and more revealing clothes. She refused, and Robin Williams supported her decision.\nDue to the abrupt changes to the show and the new timeslot, Mork & Mindy's ratings fell tremendously. It was quickly moved back to its previous timeslot but the ratings never fully recovered. Several efforts were made to return to the core of the series.\nDecline\nEdit\nFor the third season, Mindy's father and grandmother were brought back and added along with Jean and Remo. (The show itself acknowledged this desperate attempt to fix its previous meddling, with the third season's hour-long opener aptly titled \"Putting The Ork Back in Mork\"). Other supporting cast additions included two kids from the day-care center Mork worked at: the intellectual Lola and the gluttonous Stephanie. (Possible replacements for the character of Eugene.)\nWhen this idea failed to improve ratings, many wilder ideas were tried to attempt to capitalize on Williams' comedic talents.\nFourth season\nEdit\nIn the fourth season, Mork and Mindy were married. Jonathan Winters , one of Williams' idols, was brought in as their child, Mearth. Due to the different Orkan physiology , Mork laid an egg, which grew and hatched into the much older Winters. It had been previously explained that Orkans aged \"backwards\", thus explaining Mearth's appearance and that of his teacher, Miss Geezba (portrayed by then 11-year-old actress Louanne ). Other attempts included the use of special guest stars.\nIn a two-part second season episode, Raquel Welch appeared as Captain Nirvana of the Necrotons, an alien species of beautiful women that were enemies of the Orkans. There was even an episode where Mork meets Robin Williams. However, due to the continuing ratings slide, Mork and Mindy was canceled after its fourth season, on May 27, 1982.\nThe Happy Days connection\nEdit\nThe character of Mork was introduced in a season five episode of Happy Days titled \" My Favorite Orkan .\"  Richie tells everyone he has seen a flying saucer, but no one else believes him. Fonzie tells him that people make up stories about UFOs because their lives are \"humdrum.\" Then, while Richie's at home, Mork walks in. He freezes everyone with his finger except Richie and says he was sent to Earth to find a \"humdrum\" human to take back to Ork. Richie runs to Fonzie for help. When Mork catches up to him, he freezes everyone, but finds himself unable to freeze Fonzie due to The Fonz's famous and powerful thumbs . Mork challenges Fonzie to a duel: Finger vs. Thumb. After their duel, The Fonz admits defeat. But Mork decides to take Fonzie back to Ork instead of Richie. Then, Richie wakes up and realizes he was dreaming. There is a knock on the door and much to Richie's dismay, it is a man who looks exactly like Mork except in regular clothes asking for directions. When production on Mork & Mindy began, an extra scene was filmed and added to this episode for subsequent reruns. In the scene, Mork contacts Orson and explains that he decided to let Fonzie go, and was going to travel to the year 1978 to continue his mission.\nFonzie and Laverne of Laverne & Shirley appeared in the first episode of the show.  In one segment, Mork returns to 1950s Milwaukee where Fonzie sets Mork up on a date with Laverne.\nMork returned to Happy Days in an episode in 1979. Mork tells Richie that he enjoys coming to the 1950s because life is simpler and more \"humdrum\" than in the 1970s.  Fonzie sees Mork and immediately tries to run away, but Mork freezes him and makes him stay.  He eventually lets him go, but not before Fonzie asks Mork to reveal two things about the future: \"Cars and girls\". Mork's response is \"In 1979... both are faster.\" The episode is mostly a retrospective in which clips are shown as Richie and Fonzie try to explain the concepts of love and friendship to Mork.\nFour-season story development\nEdit\nMork arrives on Earth moments after Mindy has argued with her boyfriend and he drives off with her jeep. Initially believing Mork is a priest, she asks him to walk her back home.  Mindy then is startled to realize that Mork is not a priest and has actually put a man's business suit on backwards upon landing. However, the University of Colorado journalism student quickly realizes that he is telling the truth about being a friendly alien who will not hurt her. Mindy decides to let Mork stay with her. Initially, he takes up residence in a closet.\nShortly afterward, Mindy decides he can stay in the attic over her second-floor apartment; later we learn that Mr. Bickley lives downstairs. She stands up to her father, uncomfortable with cohabitation. Because he is so different, Mork needs a safe place to stay while on assignment to learn about Earth.\nDuring the second season, Mindy's father goes on tour with an orchestra, and Mindy has more involvement with her other relatives, including Nelson Flavor, who is ever ready to promote his political aspirations, and her friends Remo and Jean DaVinci, who run a local deli.  At the beginning of the third season it mysteriously transformed into DaVinci's Restaurant, with no mention of how the prior deli had been remodeled so quickly. Jean no longer is working to support herself through medical school; her job is running the restaurant.\nFred returns in the third season, as does Cora Hudson, Mindy's grandmother, but Mork has gone \"native\", preferring to be called Morry; Mindy and Mork together call Orson to ask for help and an elder appears to reindoctrinate Mork into Orkan behavior.\nAt the beginning of the final season, Mork marries Mindy, although Ork has outlawed marriage; somehow, Orson comes around and defends Mork's decision. After the wedding and the honeymoon, Mork lays an egg and it hatches to reveal their son, Mearth. He develops quickly, and takes a transporter beam to get to school on Ork each day.\nWhile trying to call Orson, Mork crosses signals with another alien ( Joe Regalbuto ), who says his name is Kalnik, from Neptune . Kalnik, his Earth wife, Mork and Mindy get together to socialize, but Kalnik reveals his true intentions when he suggests to Mork that Earth presents opportunities for powerful aliens like themselves.  Mindy overhears Kalnik and his wife say denigrating things about Mearth; Mork politely but firmly asks them to leave, and Kalnik turns on Mork. Although Mork tries to solve his problem by revealing his alien identity to Earth, Kalnik keeps threatening them, trying to annihilate them  Mork uses time-travel shoes to escape with Mindy (while Mearth stays with Fred).  Kalnik follows Mork and Mindy through time, but the series ends inconclusively, with Mork and Mindy falling through time, declaring their togetherness, a cave drawing of Mork and Mindy being the last thing we see (since the previous battle with Kalnik takes place in prehistoric times).\nAnimated Series\nEdit\nFollowing the cancellation of the live-action series, the characters quickly returned in the Saturday morning cartoon The Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour .  26 episodes were produced, each running roughly ten minutes (without commercials). Robin Williams ( Mork ), Pam Dawber ( Mindy McConnell ), Conrad Janis ( Fred McConnell ) and Ralph James ( Orson ) all reprised their roles and Shavar Ross voiced Eugene .  Laverne, Shirley and Fonzie did not appear in the Mork & Mindy segments, though Mork mentioned Fonzie being a TV character in one episode.\nIn this show, a younger Mork and Mindy attended high school, and new characters included Mork's dog-like pet Doing (pronounced Doyng), rich snob Hamilton J. DuPont XXV , and Mr. Caruthers , the Mt. Mount High School principal.\nThe series was produced by TV animation companies Hanna-Barbera and Ruby-Spears.\nRatings\nMork and Mindy was a hit during the first two of four seasons:\n1978-1979: #3\nSusan Taylor ( Morgan Fairchild )\nExidor ( Robert Donner ), an eccentric man (with possible mental illness ) who thought of himself as a prophet . He knew that Mork was an alien but no one believed him. He was the leader of a cult called The Friends of Venus , of which he was the only member. Later, since the Venusians had abandoned him, he began to worship O.J. Simpson .\nMr. Sternhagen ( Foster Brooks ), Mindy's boss when she got a job at a local TV station.\nGlenda Faye Comstock, a neighbor played by show producer Crissy Wilzak Comstock.\nTodd Norman Taylor a.k.a. TNT ( Bill Kirchenbauer ), an obnoxious and unattractive womanizer .\nCathy ( Shelley Fabares ), Fred's new young wife.\nTwo specific children from the day care center Mork worked at; Lola (Amy Tenowich), the young philosopher, and Stephanie (Stephanie Kayano), the chubby-faced Asian who loves to eat.\nFilming locations\nEdit\nIn an interview with Garry Marshall on June 30, 2006 , Pat O'Brien mentioned that Mork & Mindy was filmed on Paramount stage 27, now the home of O'Brien's show The Insider.\nThe house from the show is located at 1619 Pine Street, just a few blocks away from the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder.\nThe same house was used for exterior shots on Perfect Strangers, where the cousins Larry and Balki lived with their wives.\nSpin-offs and adaptations\nIn 1979, there was a short-lived Brazilian version titled Superbronco. It was produced by Rede Globo, starring comedian Ronald Golias and actress Liza Vieira.\nNike SB released a Mork & Mindy colorway Dunk, following the colors of Mork's spacesuit.\nTwo of Mork's phrases became the final words spoken by AC/DC frontman Bon Scott on his last album, the 1979 Highway to Hell before his death in February 1980. At the end of the last song on the LP, Night Prowler, Scott says, \"Shazbot, na-nu na-nu\".\nThe episode featuring the character Arnold Wanker was extensively edited when transmitted on the British network ITV as the word wanker, although a reasonably recognizable surname in the United States and of German origin, is in British English a vulgar term for a person who masturbates. When the episode was repeated on the more liberal Channel Four, some years later no alterations were made.\nThe show was spoofed in the 1979 pornographic film Playthings , which features Dork (Larry Davis) coming to Earth to learn about sex from Cindy (Starr Wood).\nEpisodes\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\n...

Mork and Mindy | Child Of The 1980's Mork and Mindy | Child Of The 1980's\nChild Of The 1980's\nMork and Mindy\nPosted by Big Boo on October 20th, 2008\nWhy is it that the US seems to be very good at creating unusual sitcoms? Â Sure the UK has produced a number of popular and well loved shows but if you like a more out there slant to your comedy the Americans seem to be best at it, from old classics such as Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie to the subject of this post, Mork and Mindy.\nMork and Mindy was actually one of the many spin offs from the immensely popular Happy Days, believe it or not! Â I know it might seem unlikely that a show set in the 1950’s could spawn a (then) present day show about an alien but its true. Â The character of Mork (played by Robin Williams in his big TV break) first appeared in an episode of Happy Days where he tried to abduct Richie Cunningham as a study subject to take back to his home world Ork. Â Luckily, the Fonz prevented this and Mork went back empty handed.\nThe spin off show started in 1978 and saw Mork returning to Earth in his egg shaped spaceship to further study humans. Â He befriends student Mindy (Pam Dawber) and ends up living in her attic space when she discovers that he is actually an alien, a fact that she keeps secret from her friends and family despite Mork’s often bizarre behaviour, strange language (shazbot is obviously a sort of curse word on Ork) and propensity to drink liquids through his finger.\nRobin Williams was best known at the time on the stand up comedy circuit, and was skilled in the art of improvisational comedy. Â Much of Mork’s dialogue in the show was ad-libbed by Williams during filming, and indeed it got to the point where the writers would often insert gaps in the script for Williams to do his stuff.\nEach episode of the programme involved Mork investigating some aspect of human life and then reporting back to Orkan leader Orson. Â Mork would do this telepathically, sitting cross legged on the sofa and chanting “Mork calling Orson, come in Orson”. Â Orson had a booming voice and despite never really seeing him we had to assume he was a bit on the portly side, since Mork would often refer to him using phrases like “Your immenseness”.\nThe reports consisted of Mork, clad in his spacesuit, talking to the unseen Orson in front of a black background. Â Of course, Mork never usually got things quite right, but these were often the only time in the show that Mork was anywhere close to serious. Â All his reports ended with him tweaking his ears and say “nanu nanu”, which I presume means goodbye in Orkan.\nThe show lasted for four seasons, and whilst initially extremely successful it suffered in future years when the format was meddled with. Â Initially the show featured Mindy’s father, Fred, and grandmother, Cora, as recurring characters, but in the second series, in an attempt to appeal to a younger audience, they were dropped and replaced by brother and sister Remo and Jean DaVinci who ran a deli, and grumpy neighbour Mr. Bickley, who wrote the rhymes for greetings cards.\nThe third season saw Mindy’s father and grandmother return to the show along with the DaVinci’s and in the fourth and final series Mork actually married Mindy and started a family. Â However, as had been previously mentioned in the show, Orkans actually aged backwards. Â One day Mork laid an egg (it was enormous, and must have been quite painful to pass!) and out came their son Mearth, a fully grown, more elderly man but who still acted more like a human toddler in the way he both spoke and dressed. Â To further emphasise the gag Mearth’s assigned Orkan teacher was played by a young girl, presented as being a wise and trusted member of the Orkan race.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nMork & Mindy (TV Series 1978–1982) Quotes on IMDb: ...

Get Known if you don't have an account\nShare\nTimeline\nNanu nanu!\nThis 1978ï¿½82 Fantastic Comedy series on ABC , spun off from an episode of Happy Days , introduced the world to the comic genius of Robin Williams .\nWilliams played Mork, a visitor from the planet Ork. After his egg-like space vessel landed near Boulder, Colorado, Mork bonded with a pretty Earth woman named Mindy McConnell (Pam Dawber). Late in the series, they became romantically involved, got married, and Mork promptly laid an egg out of which was born their son Mearth ( Jonathan Winters ).\nThe supporting cast started off being mainly Mindy's straitlaced father Fred (Conrad Janis) and her free-spirited grandmother Cora (Elizabeth Kerr); later seasons added a small circle of friends along with curmudgeonly downstairs neighbor Mr. Bickley (Tom Poston) and a self-styled prophet named Exidor (Robert Donner).\nEvery episode ended with Mork's report to Orson, the unseen being who sent him to Earth, on Mork's latest lesson in Earth culture.\nThis series provides examples of:\nAdded Alliterative Appeal : Mork, Mindy, and later on, Mearth.\nAlien Among Us : And since it's a spinoff of Happy Days, aliens are also presumably canon in that show's universe but just never make an appearance outside the one time. Which is just strange.\nAmusing Alien : Mork, natch.\nAn Aesop : Typically more for Mork, but sometimes for the viewer as well.\nAnd Knowing Is Half the Battle : Depending on how you look at it, some of the reports to Orson can be seen as this, although it's a subversion in that it's not addressed to the viewer directly.\nAnimated Adaptation : In which they gain a six-legged pink dog. The '80s were a special time...\nBadass Cape : In the episode \"Watcher of Earth\", an alien named Xerko comes to Earth and challenges Mork to a battle. Before the battle, he puts on a Badass Cape... only to tear it off in an exaggerated twirl.\nBait-and-Switch Comment : During a conversation with Mr. Bickley about his marital status.\nMr. Bickley: I lost her in 1966.\nMindy: Oh, I'm sorry.\nMr. Bickley: Every night I pray that the old bat doesn't find me.\nBelly Buttonless : After Mork and Mindy get married and have sex for the first time, Mork proves he had laid an egg by showing his navel — since he's an Orkan he doesn't have one from the natural gestation process. Other than all the times he'd shown his belly before that episode and we'd seen it.\nBerserk Button : Not much really makes Mork angry, but hurting Mindy in front of him is a good way to do it.\nBetty and Veronica : Mindy and Susan, in the first season.\nBeware the Nice Ones : Mork may be a childlike jokester, but he is still an alien with limited telekinetic abilities, and can be a dangerous opponent when angered, as seen in \"The Night They Raided Mind-ski's\".\nBizarre Alien Biology : The Orkans are chicken-descended bipeds who age backwards, drink through their fingers, and whose males lay eggs; they also possess odd powers, allergies and reactions.\nBlowing a Raspberry : This show had recurring a elder character from Mork's planet whose name was pronounced by blowing a raspberry. This leads to the wonderful parting line from Mork and Mindy at the end of his first appearance as he turns to leave:\nMork: We'll write!\nMindy: As soon as we figure out how to spell [blown raspberry]\nBroken Aesop : In \"Mork and the Bum Rap,\" Mindy asks the bum, Godfried, why he doesn't take on responsibility. Godfried reminisces about getting married, raising a couple of kids and then sending them through college. He said he did that, that's why he's a bum!\nThe Bus Came Back : Mindy's Dad returned in Season 3.\nCan't Believe I Said That : in \"Mork Runs Down\", Mindy's father. Justified in that he's using very goofy alien words.\nMork, don't worry. After you get your gleek, your gorgles will be gone! (Beat) I can't believe I just said that.\nCatch Phrase : \"Nanu nanu\", \"shazbot\" and other \"alien\" words used by Mork.\nCelebrity Paradox : Averted thoroughly when Mork meets Robin Williams.\nCharacterization Marches On / Retcon : People who see Mork's original appearance on Happy Days after watching this series are likely to be shocked at what a Jerkass he originally was and that his appearance was said to have been All Just a Dream in that episode. Oddly enough All Just a Dream was a hurdle that another Happy Days spinoff (the long-forgotten Out of the Blue, which featured an angel as its protagonist) had to overcome as well.\nChristmas Episode : \"Mork's First Christmas\" (season 1). Mindy has to explain to Mork the meaning of the holiday.\nColor Me Black : Mork uses his Orkan powers to turn a bunch of racists into Latino, Black and Asian, among more exotic changes. They were expies of the KKK, so they didn't know it until they took their white hoods off\n.\nBroken Aesop : Well, maybe not broken. Dinged a little. In an episode about how racism is bad, they really should have resisted the urge to use the stereotypical \"Asian music\" sting when one of the women takes off her hood and is revealed as Chinese.\nCool Old Lady : Mindy's Grandma Cora.\nCorpsing : Often. It's really hard to keep a straight face when Robin Williams is around. One especially noticeable example comes in the \"It's a Wonderful Mork\" episode: Mork is supposed to be invisible and inaudible as he observes Mindy's life without him, so Pam Dawber makes a valiant but ultimately futile effort to keep a straight face to Robin's antics.\nApparently, Robin liked to do this deliberately. In an interview, Pam mentioned one time where he stood offstage completely naked just to mess with her.\nCousin Oliver : The rare middle-aged variation in Jonathan Winters.\nCrossover : The first episode featured a flashback to Mork getting dating help from Fonzie . Said date turns out to be Laverne .\nMork also appeared in an episode of another Happy Days spinoff, Out of the Blue.\nCrouching Moron, Hidden Badass : Some jerks make fun of Mork's son Mearth, and suddenly the joking, light-hearted alien is scary serious. A sobering reminder that Mork is indeed not from around here.\nBefore Mearth was born, Mork had his Crowning Moment of Awesome when he gave a Karmic Transformation to a group of racists who were terrorizing Mindy because she had some Polish heritage.\nDrunk on Milk : Mork does not react well with either carbonation, or ginger.\nEstablishing Character Moment : How Williams got this character back on Happy Days . He went to the audition for a \"alien character\". When he was called to the auditioning, they found him sitting upside-down (like Mork in the show) and that was pretty much enough to give him the role.\nEvery Episode Ending : \"Mork calling Orson. Come in, Orson...\"\n\" Come in, laser breath! \": Although not in the earlier episodes, and even then, it was initially only done on occasion.\nFantastic Anthropologist : Mork's job is essentially to observe humans in their natural habitat.\nFile Mixup : In \"Mork's Health Tips\", Mork rescues Mindy when a hospital mistakenly schedules her for brain surgery after confusing her with a Mavis McDonald.\nForeign Cuss Word : Shazbot!\nFunctional Magic : Much of what Mork could do.\nFunny Schizophrenia : Exidor, the Ensemble Darkhorse , had a habit of talking to imaginary cult members, seeing closets as oceans and other bizarre behavior. All Played for Laughs .\nGetting Crap Past the Radar : Named for Williams' efforts to sneak all manner of things past the censors on this show.\nHuman Outside, Alien Inside : Orkans can drink with their finger (and use various Psychic Powers focused through their index fingers), have three hearts, physically age backwards, and are hatched from eggs which come from the male's bellybuttonnote Prior to that, they were artificially grown in laboratories using test tubes.\nHumorless Aliens : Mork has a hard time with the concept of humor.\nOh, humor! AR! AR!\nImported Alien Phlebotinum : The occasional piece of Orkan technology, such as the hand-held device that temporarily aged Mork so that he could provide Mindy's grandmother with a date.\nIncredible Shrinking Man : The second-season premiere, \"Mork in Wonderland\", has Mork shrinking into a micro universe after he takes a cold pill.\nInformed Ability : Mindy teaches music lessons, but is never shown playing any instruments.\nInnocence Lost : Subverted. Mork is talked into freeing an escaped criminal who claims that he just needs to visit his sick mother and will return to turn himself back in afterward. Sure enough, Mork is arrested for freeing him and Mindy tells him that it is obvious that the crook took advantage of him and won't be back. In a genuinely moving moment, Mork tearfully agrees that he can't trust anyone again, until the crook suddenly returns as promised to turn himself in and get Mork released. With that, Mork's innocence is restored with his naive belief in the goodness of humanity vindicated.\nLampshade Hanging :\nMindy: Oh, Mork; what Earth concept have you misunderstood this week?\nLeft Hanging : The final episode of the series has the titular duo lost in time and space being chased by a vengeance-crazed Venusian with no resolution in sight.\nLight Bulb Joke : How many Martians does it take to screw in a lightbulb? 8.7 Arh! Arh!\nMan Bites Man : Played for Laughs in \"Mork's Health Tips\", when Mork bites a nurse who is trying to recapture Mindy. According to Mork, the nurse returned the favor.\nMr. Seahorse : Orkan males lay eggsnote  Or at least Mork does. It was previously mentioned that Orkans are artificially created in test tubes.\nMind Screw : The episode where Mork meets Robin Williams. Really\n.\nNo Celebrities Were Harmed : The second season premiere features Bizarro versions of comedians Bob Hope (\"Bob Faith\"), Danny Thomas (\"Danny St. Thomas\") and Jerry Lewis (\"Jerry Looney\").\nNo Sense of Humor : In early episodes, Mork identifies people making In-Universe jokes by saying \"Oh, humor - Ar-Ar!\" And almost as often he does that when people aren't joking.\nOnce an Episode : Every episode ended with Mork broadcasting his experiences to Orson, saying, \"Mork calling Orson; come in, Orson. Mork calling Orson...come in, Orson...\"\nPardon My Klingon : Slightly lampshaded when Mork is thinking of revealing himself as an alien in season 1:\nMindy's Dad: And people will follow you around saying \"Shazbot!!\"\nMork: If only they knew what that meant...\nMindy once mentioned Robin Williams was in town for a show (!). Mork cracks up at the name, and whispers to Mindy what \"robin\" means on his world. Apparently it's disgusting.\nIn the episode with Rick and Ruby, Mork sang an entire verse of \"This Heart Is Closed for Alterations\" in Orkan.\nPhysical God : Mork possesses super strength and telekinesis as well as mind-control powers, can freeze time, can control earthly elements (like wind) to some extent, and is capable of raising people from the dead.\nPut on a Bus : Mindy's Dad and Grandma in the second season, in favor of a bunch of new characters - most of who were in turn Put on a Bus the 3rd season.\nRunning Gag : Mork teasing Orson about his girth in his debriefings.\nScenery Censor : On one occasion, Mork walked out of the shower naked to talk to a shocked Mindy, who had to explain human customs regarding nudity. The low cabinet that blocked his bathing-suit-area kept the audience from seeing that Robin Williams actually was naked.\nOrson: Mork! This is not your regular night to report back .\nMork: Quite true, your Immenseness! However I had to do a Spin On to pay back for my Spin-Off .\nSplit Personality / Starfish Character : In an early episode Mork attempts to turn himself into The Spock but it backfires, releasing all his emotions as separate personalities instead.\nStandardized Sitcom Housing : Mostly averted: Mindy's upper-floor apartment in an old Victorian house had few of the usual features of a typical sit com home.\nStraight Man : Anyone not named Robin Williams. Or Robert Donner (Exidor). Or Johnathan Winters.\nStraw Vulcan : Mork's race, which is why they sent him to Earth.\nTimmy in a Well : Referenced in \"Mork Runs Down\". Mork, severely ill, has to use non-verbal communication with the McConnalls.\nMindy: I think he's trying to tell us something.\nMr. McConall: Yeah, I feel like I'm in a Lassie movie.\nTsundere : Mr. Bickley is a rare male example. He acts harsh, but every time someone shows him kindness, he becomes adorable.\nVocal Evolution : Mork's nasal \"spaceman\" voice gradually disappeared through the show's run, as Mork grew more accustomed to Planet Earth.\n\n"
