Religion in \"Robinson Crusoe\" - Academic Home Page Religion in \"Robinson Crusoe\"\nSPIRITUAL AUTOBIOGRAPHY\nOne way of reading Robinson Crusoe is as a spiritual autobiography . The spiritual biography/autobiography portrays the Puritan drama of the soul. Concerned about being saved, having a profound sense of God's presence, seeing His will manifest everywhere, and aware of the unceasing conflict between good and evil, Puritans constantly scrutinized their lives to determine the state of their souls and looked for signs of the nature of their relationship with God (i.e., saved or not). The spiritual autobiography usually follows a common pattern: the narrator sins, ignores God's warnings, hardens his heart to God, repents as a result of God's grace and mercy, experiences a soul-wrenching conversion, and achieves salvation. The writer emphasizes his former sinfulness as a way of glorifying God; the deeper his sinfulness, the greater God's grace and mercy in electing to save him. He reviews his life from the new perspective his conversion has given him and writes of the present and the future with a deep sense of God's presence in his life and in the world.\nReaders through the nineteenth century read Robinson Crusoe in this light. For example, a reviewer for the Dublin University Magazine called the book \"a great religious poem, showing that God is found where men are absent\" (1856). In deciding whether or to what extent Robinson Crusoe is a spiritual autobiography and \"a great religious poem,\" you might consider the following:\nIn the \"Preface,\" Defoe announces that his intention is \"to justify and honour the wisdom of Providence in all the variety of our circumstances\" (xv).\nCrusoe receives warnings against the rashness of going to sea from his father and from the captain of the first ship he sails on. Both are figures of authority and can be seen as proxies for God. In ignoring their warnings, is he also denying God's providential social order in the world and, by implication, God? By \"God's providential social order in the world\" I mean that God arranged the world hierarchically, endowing the king with authority in the political realm and the father with authority in the family.\nDoes Providence send him punishments and deliverances to awaken a sense of his sinfulness and to turn him to God? Are the shipwrecks and his enslavement, his escape from slavery and then from the island evidence of God's Providence or merely chance?\nIn the Puritan view, the duplication of dates for significant events is indisputable evidence of Providence at work. Crusoe notes that the date he ran away from his family is the same date he was captured and made a slave; the day that he survived his first shipwreck is the same date he was cast ashore on the island; and the day he was born is the same day he was cast ashore, \"so that my wicked life and my solitary life begun both on a day\" (129). Is this similarity of dates the working of Providence or merely chance, meaningless coincidence?\nCrusoe throughout uses religious language, imagery, and Biblical references (he quotes 20 passages from the Bible). Does this reflect the extent to which his belief in Providence has permeated his life, or have his conversion and subsequent Bible studies and religious meditation merely provided him with a language which has become habitual?\nCrusoe converts Friday to Christianity. Is Crusoe saving his soul for spiritual reasons or for self-interest to make Friday more tractable, reliable, and controllable?\nCrusoe narrates his life story long afterward, and from the beginning of his tale Crusoe presents events not only from his point of view as a youth but also from a Christian perspective; he looks at his past through the eyes of the convert who now constantly sees the working of Providence. He tells of his first shipwreck and of his then ignoring what he now perceives as God's warning, \"... Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse. For if I would not take this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy\" (7).\nAre \"the secret hints and notices of danger\" (244) evidence of Providence's warnings or merely the expression of his unconscious or unacknowledged desires and fears? Is it relevant that Defoe believed in friendly Daimons who execute God's Providence?\nWhen we are in a quandary, as we call it, a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way or that, a secret hint shall direct us to got his way when we intended to go another way; nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps business has called to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind, from we know not what springs, and by we know not what power, shall overrule us to go this way, and it shall afterwards appear that had we gone that way which we would have gone and even to our imagination ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost. (Vision of the Angelic World)\n \nCRUSOE'S ORIGINAL SIN\nCrusoe's conversation with his father about leaving home can be interpreted from a religious perspective as well from an economic perspective . Crusoe repeatedly refers to leaving home without his father's permission as his \"original sin\"; he not only associates God and his father but regards his sin against his father as a sin against God also. Remembering his first voyage, Crusoe comments: \"...my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has been since, reproached me with the contempt of advice and the breach of my duty to God and my Father\" (5). In the Puritan family structure, the father was regarded as God's deputy; in rejecting his father's advice, Crusoe is committing Adam and Eve's sin of disobedience. For Crusoe, as for Adam, and Eve, disobedience grows out of restlessness and discontent with the station God assigned.\nWhen Crusoe is cast ashore on a deserted island, he sees his situation as the fulfillment of his father's prediction that if Crusoe disregarded his advice, Crusoe would find himself alone with no source of help. Alone on the island, is Crusoe Everyman, alienated from God because of sin? Alternately, Michael McKeon offers possible interpretations of Crusoe's original sin which are related to social motivation:\nan expression of capitalistic industry,\nan anticapitalist impulse to ramble and evade his capitalist calling,\nan anti-Puritan motive to evade his Puritan calling, with a general unregenerate waywardness with no social significance.\n\n"
