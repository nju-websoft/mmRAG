How the deportation story emerged - Home - BBC News BBC NEWS | UK | UK Politics | How the deportation story emerged\nPrintable version\nHow the deportation story emerged\nHere is the sequence of events in the row over the 1,023 foreign prisoners who were released without being considered for deportation:\nFEBRUARY 1999\nThe first of the 1,023 foreign nationals at the centre of the row is freed after serving their sentence.\nHowever, the offender does not face a hearing for deportation, as required of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.\nOver the next seven years, more than 1,000 more also escape scrutiny on release from jail.\n2003\nHM Inspector of Prisons' annual report talks of an \"institutional blind spot\" for foreign nationals within the prison service and a dilatory attitude from the Immigration Service, \"which unless pressed, was not monitoring those liable to deportation and making arrangements for this to take place as soon as sentence had expired\".\n2004\nAnother HMPI report reveals that a new prison service order \"provides no guidance to prisons on work with foreign nationals beyond their status as potential immigration detainees\".\nJANUARY 2005\nHome Office officials first become aware that a number of foreign criminals have been released from UK jails without being considered for deportation, according to a subsequent briefing by the prime minister's official spokesman.\nJULY 2005\nIn some instances, action on criminal cases was not being initiated until a late stage, allowing insufficient time to make preparations for removal before the end of sentence\nNational Audit Report, July 2005\nDownload the reader here\nThe National Audit Office, an independent watchdog, publishes a report on returning failed asylum applicants, which warned that preparations to remove foreign criminals from the UK should begin \"much earlier\".\nIt said officials were unable to say how many failed applicants had been released from prison because removal could not be arranged.\nMr Clarke has admitted that his attention was first brought to the problem on publication of this report.\nThe government proposed extra investment, and according to the prime minister, nearly ï¿½3m more has since been invested in increasing resources in the key areas.\nThe Home Office has since revealed that 288 of the 1,023 were freed after August 2005.\nOCTOBER 2005\nConservative MP Richard Bacon raises the issue during a meeting of the cross-party Public Accounts Committee in the Commons.\nHe asked what happened to foreign nationals - particularly asylum seekers - on release from prison.\nIt was around this time that Mr Clarke says he became \"fully aware\" of the scale of the issue.\nIf you are judged by the system to have a failed asylum application and you shouldn't be here, then shouldn't you be considered for deportation once you are released from prison?\nRichard Bacon MP\nHe told BBC's Today programme that he \"set in motion a whole set of procedures to change the way the prison service and nationality directorate were working\".\nThe Home Office then told Parliament that a new system was in place to correct the inadequacy.\nDECEMBER 2005\nThe Home Secretary warns Prime Minister Tony Blair that hundreds of foreign prisoners have been freed without the required investigation into whether they should be deported.\nMr Clarke has since told the BBC: \"He agreed we needed to take very strong steps to deal with it.\"\nFEBRUARY 2006\nMinisters become aware that 288 more foreign prisoners had been released since August 2005, despite the changes they had pledged to implement.\nA third successive annual report by the prisons inspectorate highlights shortcomings in foreign nationals policy.\nMARCH 2006\nThe Public Accounts Committee (PAC) publishes its report on returning failed asylum applicants, criticising the inefficient way they were handled.\nThe report, based on investigations by the cross-party committee of MPs, notes that between 2001 and August 2005, \"403 foreign nationals were released from prison without deportation proceedings being completed\".\nOne member, Conservative Richard Bacon, writes back to the Home Office requesting more information.\nSir David Normington, permanent secretary at the Home Office, realises the figures were wrong and alerts the home secretary.\n25 APRIL 2006\nMarch - 25\nSource: Public Accounts Committee\nKnowing the issue would emerge at the PAC hearing on 26 April, the Home Office admits more than 1,000 foreign criminals were released between 1999 and March 2006 without being considered for deportation.\nMr Blair is told that murderers and rapists have been released just four days before the public, and more than three weeks after Mr Clarke was made aware.\nMr Clarke says he offered to resign, admitting it was his responsibility, but the prime minister tells him he does not consider it necessary.\nClarke's regret over prisoner releases\n28 APRIL 2006\nThe home secretary reveals that five of the criminals convicted of serious offences have committed new crimes since their release, including violence and drugs offences. One of them is also facing rape allegations. Mr Clarke insists he will stay in his job to repair the situation.\nIn full: Clarke statement\n1 MAY 2006\nIt emerges that it took Mr Clarke three weeks to tell the prime minister that serious criminals were among the prisoners not considered for deportation. The Home Office says it briefed Mr Blair when it could give him full details.\nClarke took weeks to tell Blair\n3 MAY 2006\nMr Clarke promises new laws to make it a presumption that any foreigners convicted of an imprisonable offence should be deported automatically unless there are special circumstances.\nHe says deportation action is being started against 70 of the most serious offenders but the Home Office has only accounted for 32 of them. The Tories say the government has lost control.\nIn full: Tory response\n5 MAY 2006\nCharles Clarke is sacked as home secretary and refuses the offer of another Cabinet post. Defence Secretary John Reid is named as his successor.\nClarke: An impossible job?\n8 MAY 2006\nThe new home secretary revises the number of serious offenders freed without being deported from 90 to at least 150. And he says the final figure could end up being \"several hundred\" if armed robbers are included in the category.\nForeign prisoner figures worsen\n15 MAY 2006\nJohn Reid reveals that one murderer is among the freed criminals still at large. He again changes the figure for the number of serious offenders on the list and says there are 179, with 81 of them in the government's control.\nThe home secretary says 880 of the total 1,023 cases have been considered for deportation. There has been an initial decision to deport in 649 cases.\nIn full: Freed prisoners' offences\n16 MAY 2006\nCabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell says civil servants should not resign over the foreign prisoners fiasco which cost Charles Clarke his job.\n'No sackings over freed prisoners'\n17 MAY 2006\nConservative leader David Cameron accuses Tony Blair of making up policy as he goes along over deportation of foreign prisoners.\nThe prime minister insists he has not shifted his position - he wants the \"vast bulk\" of foreign prisoners to be deported automatically \"irrespective of any claim that they have that the country to which they are going back may not be safe\".\nBlair in new deportation row\n20 MAY 2006\nAttorney General Lord Goldsmith says the UK is to ask the European Court of Human Rights to review its absolute ban on deporting people to countries where they could face torture or death.\nUK seeks human rights law review\n22 MAY 2006\nTony McNulty, one of the ministers under fire in the foreign prisoners debacle, is replaced as immigration minister by Police Minister Liam Byrne in a Home Office reshuffle.\nA Home Office spokesman rejects claims the move was a result of recent immigration scandals.\n23 MAY 2006\nHome Secretary John Reid says 85 of the 186 serious foreign released prisoners are still at large.\nOf the 37 \"most serious\" offenders, 27 are in jail, including four murderers, and two are thought to be dead, he tells MPs.\nReid attacks 'unfit' Home Office\n24 MAY 2006\nMr Reid apologises after figures he gave MPs the previous day on the foreign prisoners releases proved to be wrong.\nOf the serious offenders he said were in prison, some had in fact been released on bail.\nReid 'furious' over wrong figures\n25 MAY 2006\nHome Office Permanent Secretary, Sir David Normington, tells senior police officers he deeply regrets the sacking of ousted Home Secretary Charles Clarke.\nHe says the series of crises at the Home Office has caused \"immense damage\" to the department.\nHome Office 'damaged' by scandals\n26 MAY 2006\nForeign inmates at Ford open prison in Sussex are returned to closed prisons after 11 absconded in May.\nThe escapees had convictions for offences including drugs offences and fraud.\nOpen jail moving foreign inmates\n27 MAY 2006\nThe Home Office is looking into reports hundreds of foreign offenders have been freed from secure hospitals without being considered for deportation.\nA newspaper report says police are seeking up to 500 former mental patients, including murderers, rapists and paedophiles.\n24 SEPTEMBER 2006\nA unit set up to trace dangerous foreign criminals is closed by the Home Office.\nPolice officers recommended that the unit be closed down rather than it being a political decision, Mr Reid said.

New Home Office foreign criminals scandal - Telegraph New Home Office foreign criminals scandal  - Telegraph\nUK News\nNew Home Office foreign criminals scandal\nThe Home Office was plunged into crisis last night after it wrongly allowed    violent foreign prisoners to be freed into the community.\nLast night MPs called for Theresa May, the Home Secretary, to 'do the right thing' and admit the full scale of the problem Photo: PA\nBy David Barrett , Home Affairs Correspondent\n9:30PM BST 06 Aug 2011\nFollow\nAt least eight foreigners convicted of violent or sexual offences were released automatically at the end of their jail terms instead of being considered for deportation.\nThey are thought to include at least one killer. An unknown number of less-serious foreign criminals such as thieves and drug dealers have also been wrongly freed.\nThe catastrophic errors are a repeat of the scandal five years ago which led to the then-home secretary being sacked and the department declared \"unfit for purpose\".\nLast night MPs called for Theresa May, the Home Secretary, to \"do the right thing\" and admit the full scale of the problem.\nIt was unclear whether the eight have gone on to commit more crimes. Remarkably, two of them have since been granted permission to extend their stay in Britain - one of them on \"human rights\" grounds.\nRelated Articles\n1,000 foreign prisoners not deported\n16 Oct 2008\nUnder rules introduced following the last scandal in 2006, any foreign national who is convicted of a serious crime, or is sentenced to more than 12 months in prison, must be considered for deportation on release.\nAs each one nears the end of their sentence, prison chiefs are meant to alert the UK Border Agency's Criminal Casework Directorate, which decides whether deportation is appropriate. If the decision is taken to deport, the convict is not freed at the end of the sentence but is instead transferred to an immigration detention centre to await removal.\nThe Home Office admitted last night that the system had failed, saying that five foreign prisoners had been freed into the community without being considered for deportation since 2006. A spokesman denied knowledge of further breaches, saying: \"We do not have that information.\"\nHowever, The Sunday Telegraph has seen evidence that senior officials are aware of at least three more serious offenders having been freed since early in 2010, bringing the total to eight.\nThe spokesman insisted that officials had not lost contact with the initial five wrongly-freed convicts, and at least one has since been deported. However, it remains unclear whether others have disappeared.\nOne has since won the right to stay in Britain under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which gives the \"right to family life\". Another has won \"indefinite leave to remain\".\nThe Home Office, which oversees the UK Border Agency, blamed the crisis on the Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for prisons.\n\"There were issues in the Prisons Service and not the UKBA,\" said a Home Office spokesman.\nNo-one at the Ministry of Justice was available to comment last night.\nDavid Davis MP, the former Conservative shadow home secretary, said: \"Clearly this is a very serious matter. But in addition to the original sin, it is a disgrace the Home Office is not willing to release figures on something which is of such public importance.\n\"They must tell the public exactly what they have done to bring these dangerous criminals under control and be fully open about the extent of this problem.\n\"I would say to Theresa May that the right thing to do is to tell the public what has happened, and what has been done to protect them, and not to try to cover this up in any way.\"\nThe scandal mirrors that which led to Charles Clarke being sacked as home secretary by Tony Blair, who was Prime Minister.\nIn April 2006 Mr Clarke admitted more than 1,000 foreign criminals had been released without being considered for deportation.\nIt later emerged that the National Audit Office had warned the department of the problem 10 months earlier, and in the intervening period nearly 300 offenders had been freed.\nSome of the offenders mistakenly freed had gone on to commit further crimes, including murder, and others were never traced.\nIn the wake of the scandal, Mr Clarke was replaced in a Cabinet reshuffle by John Reid, who immediately declared that the Home Office was \"not fit for purpose\".\nThe rules were tightened in an attempt to ensure that foreigners convicted of serious crimes would always be considered for deportation before their release.\nIn a further reform, the Home Office was broken up, with responsibilities for prisons and other major areas handed to the newly-created Ministry of Justice.\nAmong the original 1,013 offenders in the 2006 scandal, 43 fell into the \"most serious\" category, including killers, rapists and paedophiles, and 145 into the \"more serious\" group made up of other violent and sex offenders.\nThe remaining cases were mainly thieves and other non-violent criminals, including those convicted of drug offences.\nAll eight of the new cases so far uncovered fall into the \"most serious\" or \"more serious\" groups, suggesting that a far larger number have also been freed from the lower group.\nDavid Wood, of the UK Border Agency, said: \"We have made considerable improvements to the way we deport foreign national prisoners.\n\"We receive around 500 referrals per month and work closely with other agencies to ensure we deal with all foreign national prisoners, including cases where the offender will be released on sentencing directly from court, those serving short sentences and remand prisoners.\n\"In 2010 we removed or deported 5,235 foreign national prisoners from the UK.\n\"We are constantly working to improve these practices and in July 2010 secured access to the Crown Courts database so we can access information about sentencing more quickly.\"\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\n... home affairs editor.

Home Office minister and ... 200 in foreign prisoners scandal to be allowed to stay ... 200 in foreign prisoners scandal to be allowed to stay, MPs told | UK news | The Guardian\n200 in foreign prisoners scandal to be allowed to stay, MPs told\nAlan Travis , home affairs editor\nTuesday 6 June 2006 19.11 EDT\nFirst published on Tuesday 6 June 2006 19.11 EDT\nShare on Messenger\nClose\nMore than 200 of the 1,019 foreign prisoners released without being considered for deportation are to be allowed to stay in Britain after all, MPs were told yesterday. The Home Office's most senior immigration official, Lin Homer, also said that eight of the most serious offenders who were released had still to be found and the police were about to launch a \"case by case\" publicity campaign to trace them.\n\"To the best of my knowledge, we have not achieved the detention of these people,\" said Ms Homer, director-general of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. She added that she felt she had let down Charles Clarke over the foreign prisoners scandal that led to his sacking as home secretary and admitted that it would take \"years, not months\" to get the directorate working properly.\nShe confirmed to MPs on the Commons home affairs select committee that the new home secretary, John Reid, had ordered a fundamental review of the way the Home Office - including the IND - operates to make it \"fit for purpose\". A report would be made within six weeks. It is expected that the IND review, to be carried out by Ms Homer, will consider one of Mr Reid's favoured options - transforming it into an arms-length Whitehall agency.\nBut the head of immigration irritated MPs when she said she was not able to provide precise figures for the number of foreign prisoners who had been released on bail or were held in special hospitals under mental health legislation until a fresh audit has been completed.\nJohn Denham, the former Home Office minister and committee chairman, criticised her inability to provide hard facts. He said it was extraordinary she could not provide \"very basic pieces of information\" about the outcome of bail applications by those involved.\nHer caution was provoked by the fact that two weeks ago Mr Reid was forced to apologise to the same committee after he had mistakenly told it 11 offenders were in prison when they had been freed on bail. A senior civil servant is now on \"gardening leave\" pending an investigation of how the home secretary came to give MPs misleading information.\nMs Homer, a former chief executive of Birmingham city council, who took over the IND job a year ago, said that the cause of the foreign prisoners crisis was \"a near classic case of demand outstripping supply\" in a casework unit run by managers at a \"relatively junior level\".\n\"They were not dealing with cases that were coming in through the door. Those on which work had not been concluded were being filed rather than put back in the queue,\" she said, adding later that 150 staff were now dealing with the problem, compared with 30 before. The extra staff had been taken off asylum and managed migration work to deal with the foreign prisoners crisis.\nShe said that so far an initial decision had been taken not to deport more than 200 foreign prisoners out of the original 1,019 cases who had been released without being considered for removal. Tony Blair has promised legislation to ensure that there is a legal presumption that foreign prisoners will deported at the end of their sentences.\nMs Homer said that generally deportation orders were made in about 60% of cases, but she could not tell MPs how many had actually left the country.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\n... 26 April 2006, ...

UK Politics | Opposition urge Clarke to resign - BBC News BBC NEWS | UK | UK Politics | Opposition urge Clarke to resign\nOpposition urge Clarke to resign\nThe home secretary is under fire over the revelations\nClarke faces MPs\nCharles Clarke is being urged to resign after he admitted the Home Office freed 1,023 foreign prisoners who should have been considered for deportation.\nThe home secretary insisted he should sort the problem out, and received backing from Prime Minister Tony Blair.\nBut Tory David Davis and Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said Mr Clarke had failed to protect the public.\nThe prisoners, who were released over the past seven years and include three murderers, are urgently being sought.\n'Culpable failure'\nMr Clarke's problems in the Commons were just one element of what was one of the most difficult days for the Labour government since it came to power.\nIn Bournemouth, Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt was booed and heckled by health workers at the Royal College of Nurses conference.\nWhile Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott was revealed to have had an affair with one of his secretaries.\nIn the Commons, Mr Davis, the shadow home secretary told MPs he was calling for Mr Clarke's resignation because it had emerged that 288 foreign offenders were released after he knew about the problem in July 2005.\nFigures revealed by Sir David Normington, permanent secretary at the Home Office, show that an average of 41 prisoners per month were released between September, 2005 and last month.\nI do apologise. I have apologised, I continue to do so\nCharles Clarke\nAnalysis: Blair's headline hell\nTony Blair is understood to have been told about the releases before Christmas.\nMr Davies told Mr Clarke \"that because of the culpable failure to protect the safety of the public, your position is untenable\".\nMr Clarke said 83 of the 288 released prisoners were now being considered for deportation, a further 53 had completed the process and 14 had been expelled.\nHe said he would give details of efforts to track down the serious offenders who were released in error at a later date.\nIn a statement, he told the Commons the failure of systems within the Home Office was \"deeply regrettable\" and his priority was now \"to set that right\".\n'No excuse'\n\"It's clear that the increasing numbers of cases being referred for consideration led to the process falling down,\" he said.\nMr Clarke told MPs he had said sorry for the oversight. \"I do apologise. I have apologised, I continue to do so.\"\nFOREIGN PRISONER RELEASES\nSir Menzies prisoner apology\nBut Mr Davis said although he had known the home secretary for 30 years and had \"a broad degree of respect for him\", Mr Clarke's statement revealed \"a disturbing neglect for public safety at the heart of this government\".\n\"This is yet another example of your department's failure and incompetence. There is no excuse for you not knowing about this,\" he told Mr Clarke.\nAnd Sir Menzies pressed the prime minister at question time to explain why he had not asked for Mr Clarke to step down.\nTory ex-Home Secretary Michael Howard also urged Mr Clarke to quit after his admission that \"it was shocking failure on his part\" that had led to the oversight.\n\"If our traditional principles of ministerial responsibility mean anything at all, he should no longer be in his job,\" he told the BBC.\nLord Ramsbotham, who was chief inspector of prisons between 1995 and 2001, said he had warned the Home Office that the numbers of foreign criminals in jail were increasing five years ago.\n'Police probe'\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he drew the government's attention to the problem in his last report in 2001 which was sent to ex-home secretary David Blunkett.\nMeanwhile, police have begun processing hundreds of names from the foreign prisoner scandal and have already returned results to the Home Office.\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said a team at its London HQ was running Police National Computer (PNC) checks on names being provided by the Home Office.\nThe checks will reveal if police have current addresses for the missing 900 criminals, and whether any have committed further crimes since their botched releases.\nEarlier, Mr Blair said he did not agree with Conservative claims that Mr Clarke was unable to give the Home Office the leadership it needed.\n'Systemic failure'\nThe prime minister has twice refused to accept the home secretary's offers to quit over foreign prisoner blunders.\nNumber 10 said Mr Clarke had offered to resign on Tuesday when the scandal was uncovered. In interviews, Mr Clarke said he had offered to quit on an earlier occasion as well.\nMr Blair said he regretted the oversights but added that new systems were now in place.\nHe made the comments after Conservative leader David Cameron claimed Mr Clarke had presided over a \"systemic failure\" in the Home Office and had misled the public over the scale of the problem.\n\"Isn't it clear that he cannot give the Home Office the leadership it so badly needs?\" Mr Cameron asked, to Tory cheers.\nMr Blair retorted: \"It won't surprise you to know I don't agree with that.\"\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\n... found the Home Office has made almost no progress since the foreign prisoners scandal in 2006 that led to ... a 'complete failure' to deal with foreign ...

Time and again she just hides and blames everyone else. She needs to take responsibility now for four and a half years of growing chaos and incompetence.”\nBut Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said deporting crooks has been made easier by the ­Immigration Act last year.\nHe said: “Foreign nationals who commit crime should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them. We have removed 22,000 since 2010, despite an almost 30% surge in appeals.\n“The Immigration Act represents the most radical reform of the deportation process in four decades.”\npoll loading\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nSir David Normington: A profile During his long ... over a foreign prisoners scandal in 2006, ... same post at the Home Office in January 2006. ... Sir David Normington: A profile - Telegraph.co.uk Sir David Normington: A profile  - Telegraph\nUK News\nSir David Normington: A profile\nDuring his long civil service career Sir David Normington gained the nickname the \"smiling assassin\" – but the grin soon faded after he became permanent secretary at the Home Office.\nBy Rosa Prince, Political Correspondent\n8:25PM GMT 28 Nov 2008\nWhen he took the helm nearly three years ago, the department had been condemned as \"not fit for purpose,\" its accounts in such a mess that the authorities refused to sign them off.\nDavid Normington: 'The smiling assassin'\nAfter 18 months, he was close to despair, admitting that the task was the toughest of a glittering career which until then had been confined to the more civilised environment of education.\nThe Home Office was at the eye of the storm, getting through three home secretaries in as many years.\nCharles Clarke was sacked in dramatic circumstances over a foreign prisoners scandal in 2006, while the abrasive John Reid, who Sir David clearly found difficult to get along with, quit with Tony Blair a year later.\nSince then, the \"charming,\" \"urbane\" Sir David has done much to make the Home Office ship-shape again, helped by a departmental reorganisation that gave half its responsibilities to a newly-formed Justice Department.\nRelated Articles\nSmith under pressure over arrest\n28 Nov 2008\nBut even that led to frustrations – on the internal blog which he created to keep in touch with staff, Sir David admitted being appalled by the way that news of the split had leaked before he was able to inform them himself.\nDespite that set-back, and his reputation as a ruthless hirer and firer, the permanent secretary is clearly popular with officials. Surveys show that staff satisfaction is up, and performance has also improved.\nHis relationship with Jacqui Smith, the current Home Secretary, is also good – when she arrived at the Home Office for her first day in June 2007, he kissed her on both cheeks; the two had become friends while both were working in the Department of Education.\nThe experiences of his early years at the department have toughened him; the confidence that led him to sack a third of the workforce while Permanent Secretary at Education has returned.\nFriends are not surprised that his indignation that a member of staff was apparently leaking confidential information led him to call in the police.\nLike the dutiful civil servant he is, he is also content to carry the can for ministers – making clear that it was he, and not Miss Smith, who received the word from the police that Damian Green's arrest was imminent.\nBorn: Bradford, October 1951\n\n"
