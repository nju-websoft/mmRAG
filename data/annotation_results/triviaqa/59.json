Film History Before 1920 - Filmsite.org Film History Before 1920\n1970s | 1980s | 1990s | 2000s | 2010s\nThe Lumiere Brothers and the Cinematographe:\nThe          innovative Lumiere brothers in France, Louis and Auguste (often called \"the founding fathers of modern film\"), who worked in a Lyons          factory that manufactured photographic equipment and supplies, were inspired          by Edison's work. They created their own combo movie camera and projector          - a more portable, hand-held and lightweight device that could be cranked          by hand and could project movie images to several spectators. It was dubbed          the Cinematographe and patented in February, 1895. The multi-purpose          device (combining camera, printer and projecting capabilities in the same          housing) was more profitable because more than a single spectator could          watch the film on a large screen. They used a film width of 35mm, and          a speed of 16 frames per second - an industry norm until the talkies.        By the advent of sound film in the late 1920s, 24 fps became the standard.\nThe first public test and demonstration of the           Lumieres' camera-projector system (the Cinematographe) was made on           March 22, 1895, in the Lumieres' basement. During the private screening           to a scientific conference - a trial run for their public screening           later at the end of the year (see below), they caused a sensation with           their first film, Workers\nLeaving           the Lumiere Factory (La Sortie des Ouviers de L'Usine Lumiere           a Lyon), although it          only consisted of an everyday outdoor image -  factory workers leaving            the Lumiere factory gate for home or for a lunch break.\nAs            generally acknowledged, cinema (a word derived from Cinematographe)             was born on December 28, 1895, in Paris, France. The Lumieres presented             the first commercial and public exhibition of a projected             motion picture to a paying public in the world's first movie theatre             - in the Salon             Indien,        at the Grand Cafe on Paris' Boulevard des Capucines. [In 1897, a cinema       building was built in Paris, solely for the purpose of showing films.]             It has often       been considered \"the birth of film\" or \"the       First Cinema\" since the Cinematographe was the first advanced       projector (not experimental) and the first to be offered for sale.\nThe 20-minute program          included ten short films  with twenty          showings a day. These factual shorts (or mini-documentaries), termed actualities,         with the mundane quality of home movies, included the following:\nLa Sortie des Ouviers de L'Usine Lumière à Lyon (1895) (Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory) (46 seconds)\nLa Voltige (1895) (Horse Trick Riders) (46 seconds)\nLa Pêche aux Poissons Rouges (1895) (Fishing for Goldfish) (42 seconds)\nLe Débarquement du Congrès de Photographie à Lyon (1895) (The Disembarkment of the Congress of Photographers in Lyon) (48   seconds)\nLes Forgerons (1895) (Blacksmiths) (49 seconds)\nLe Jardinier (l'Arroseur Arrosé) (The Gardener or The Sprinkler Sprinkled) (1895) (49 seconds)\nLe Repas (de Bébé) (1895) (Baby's Meal) (41 seconds)\nLe Saut à la Couverture (1895) (Jumping onto the Blanket) (41 seconds)\nLa Place des Cordeliers à Lyon (1895) (Cordeliers Square in Lyon) (44 seconds)\nLa Mer (Baignade en Mer) (1895) (Bathing in the Sea) (38 seconds)\nThe ten shorts included the famous first comedy (# 6)           of a gardener with a watering hose (aka The Sprinkler Sprinkled,           Waterer and Watered, or L'Arrouseur          Arrose), the factory worker short (# 1, see above), a sequence (#         9) of a horse-drawn  carriage approaching toward the camera, and a scene         (# 7) of the feeding of a baby. The Lumieres also became known for their         50-second short Arrivee d'un train en gare a La Ciotat (1895) (Arrival         of a Train at La Ciotat), which some sources reported was shocking         to its first unsophisticated viewing audience. By           1898, the Lumiere's company had produced a short film catalog with         over 1,000 titles.\nOther Developments in Projecting Machines:\nTwo brothers in Berlin, Germany - inventors Emil and           Max Skladanowsky  - created their own film device for projecting films           in November, 1895.\nAlso in 1895, American inventor Major Woodville           Latham (who had been working with Eugene Lauste and W.K.L. Dickson)           developed an unpopular projector called an Eidoloscope (or Panoptikon projector).           In New York on Frankfort Street, it was demonstrated by Latham for           the NY press on April 21, 1895.            It was one of the first public exhibitions of motion pictures in the           world. What was most innovative and long-lasting           was its Latham             Loop - a feature of movie projectors. It involved  the addition           of a  slack-forming loop to the film path to restrain the inertia           of the take-up  reel, and prevent the tearing of sprocket holes. It           also allowed for the  use of films longer than three minutes. (This           showing preceded the landmark exhibition of the Lumieres in Paris           by about eight months. See above.) On June 1, 1895, Latham applied           for a patent for his \"Projecting-Kinetoscope\" with the \"Latham           Loop.\" It was granted and lasted until its expiration in 1913.           By 1905, virtually all movie projectors used the Latham Loop. (The           loop is still used in virtually  all film cameras and projectors almost           to this day.)\nAnd American inventors Thomas  Armat and Charles Francis           Jenkins developed the Phantascope in            1893, an improved device (with intermittent-motion mechanisms) for           projecting films on a screen. In September-October, 1895, they debuted           their projection device (projecting Kinetoscope films, but not using           a Kinetoscope) at the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia,           and then patented it.\nIn London in January of 1896, Birt Acres also developed            a machine to project films, called a Kinetic Lantern.\nIn the same year of 1896, another Englishman Robert             William Paul also developed and manufactured a popular projector             which he called a Theatrograph. He became a pioneering film             producer in Britain through his The Northern Photographic Works company.\nIn 1896, Edison's Company (because          it was unable to produce a workable projector on its own) purchased an            improved version of Thomas Armat's movie projection machine (the Phantascope,            originally invented by C. Francis Jenkins in 1893),  and renamed it            the Vitascope.  It was hailed as Edison's           latest invention, although he had only commercialized the Phantascope. The           Vitascope was the first commercially-successful celluloid motion           picture projector in the US. On April 23, 1896, Thomas           Edison presented the first publically-projected Vitascope motion           picture (with hand-tinting) in the US to a paying American audience           on a screen, at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York City (at 34th           Street and Broadway), with his latest invention - the projecting kinetoscope           or Vitascope.           Customers watched           the Edison Company's Vitascope project a ballet sequence in           an amusement arcade during a vaudeville act. At the time, the Vitascope was           showing films in only one location, this one in NYC, but that wouldn't           last for long.\nThe \"Pathé-Frères\" Company was           founded in 1896 in Paris by Charles and Emile Pathè. By the           next decade, it would become the largest producer of films in the world.           Around 1906-7, only one-third of the films released in the US were           American-made. Pathé-Frères was responsible for over       one-third of the films shown on US screens.\nBy 1897, the 35 mm film gauge became widely           accepted as the standard gauge for motion pictures, although American           Mutoscope and other film companies continued to use other gauges. In           1909, the 35 mm width           with 4 perforations per frame became accepted as the international       standard film gauge.\nMore  Notable Films and Developments:\nThe Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight (1897), another           filmed boxing match, reported to be 100 minutes in length (the longest           film ever to be released by that date), and shown by the Veriscope             Company,           had its debut on May 22, 1897 at the Academy of Music in New York City.           Some consider it the world's first feature film. It included all fourteen           3-minute rounds of the bout, in addition to a 5-minute introduction,           and non-stop filming during the one-minute rest period between rounds.           Running commentary was provided by an expert sports announcer from           the side of the ring - the first of its kind.\nOne of the earliest projects the Edison Studios created             (probably in July of 1897) was the advertising film Admiral Cigarette             (1897), promoting the slogan \"We All Smoke.\" The             28 second-long silent film was the first prototype commercial for             the Admiral Cigarette company. Edison's film was the first advertising         film, or commercial, to be submitted for copyright, on August 5, 1897.\nThe Spanish-American War in 1898 drew camera operators             to Cuba, but they were shut out by the US Army. Since they could             not capture the battles on film, many went into studios and created             them using models and painted backdrops -- the start of scale-model         effects.\nThe First Permanent Movie Theatres:\nFilms were increasingly being shown as part of vaudeville shows, variety          shows, and at fairgrounds or carnivals. Audiences would soon need larger          theaters to watch screens with projected images from Vitascopes after          the turn of the century, using stage and opera houses and music halls. The earliest 'movie theatres' were converted          churches or halls, showing one-reelers (a 10-12 minute reel of          film - the projector's reel capacity at the time). The primitive films        were usually more actualities and comedies.\nAfter showing films in a lakefront park, William \"Pop\" Rock           and Walter Wainwright transformed a converted vacant store (at 623           Canal St.) in New Orleans, Louisiana into Vitascope Hall.           On July 26, 1896,  it became the first \"storefront theater\" in           the US dedicated exclusively to showing motion pictures, although it           screened films for only two months. The theatre accommodated 400 people,           and had two shows per day, with admission 10 cents.\nThe world's first permanent movie theatre exclusively           designed for showing motion pictures was the Edisonia Vitascope           Hall,           a 72 seat theatre which opened in downtown Buffalo, New York on Monday,           October 19, 1896 in the Ellicott Square Building on Main Street. It         was created by Buffalo-based entrepreneur Mitchell H. Mark, a supreme         visionary of the future of motion picture theaters. It was likely that           the opening night's showing including US premieres of the Lumiere films           (see above), since Mark had contracted with the Lumieres           (and Pathe Freres) in France           to exhibit their films in the US. The Vitascope Theater in Buffalo           remained open for nearly two years. With           his brother Moe, Mitchell Mark would open other  theaters in           Buffalo, as well as New York City, Boston and elsewhere. They were           responsible for one of history's earliest \"movie         palaces,\" the         2800-seat Mark Strand Theater in NYC.\nEarly Jewish film pioneer Sigmund Lubin (aka Siegmund           Lubszynski) constructed the first purposely-built movie theater in           West Philadelphia, PA for the National Export Exposition, in 1899. Lubin's           Cineograph Theatre was a small, modest portable theatre built on           the esplanade or midway of the fair. It was possibly the world's first           structure erected expressly for the presentation of motion pictures.           For ten cents, patrons could view \"continuous shows\" of the           Spanish-American War, reproductions of boxing matches, and several           of Lubin's own home-made productions. The film billed as \"The           Sensation of the Hour\" was The Dreyfus Court Martial Scene.           It was evidence of Lubin's early work as a motion picture distributor       and exhibitor, to showcase his projectors, cameras, and films.\nLater on in 1902 in  downtown           Los Angeles, Thomas L. Talley's storefront, 200-seat Electric Theater was another of the first permanent US           theaters to exclusively exhibit movies - it charged patrons a dime,           up from a nickel at the nickelodeons.\nAlice Guy (Blaché): The First Female Movie             Director\nFrench-born Alice Guy (Blaché) started in the           film business as a secretary for Léon Gaumont in 1894. In 1896,           she joined Gaumont in his new company founded in Paris in 1895, the Gaumont           Film Company, and began making primitive sound films when she was           promoted to be the head of motion picture production at the studio.           She is generally acknowledged as the world's first female director           in the motion picture industry (with France's Gaumont Film Company).           Her first film made in April of 1896 was the one-minute in length fictional           film La Fée aux Choux (The Cabbage Fairy). Some           historians consider it the first ever narrative fiction film. She became           one of the key figures in the systematic development of the narrative       film.\nGeorges Melies: French Cinematic Magician\nAside from technological achievements, another Frenchman           who was a member  of the Lumiere's viewing audience, Georges Melies,           expanded development  of film cinema with his own imaginative fantasy           films. When the Lumiere  brothers wouldn't sell him a Cinematographe,           he developed his own  camera (a version of the Kinetograph),           and then set up Europe's  first film studio in 1897. It           was  the           first movie studio that used artificial illumination, a greenhouse-like           structure that featured both a glazed roof and walls and a series of           retractable blinds. It was an influential model on the development           of future studios.\nParisian French film-maker Georges Méliès           first film based on a trick of substitution (one of the earliest instances           of trick photography with stop-action - an early special effect) was Escamotage d'une dame au théâtre Robert Houdin (1896) (aka       The Conjuring of a Woman at the House of Robert Houdin). The roots       of horror films (and vampire films       in particular) may also be traced back to  Georges Méliès'       two-minute short film Le Manoir du Diable (1896) (aka Manor/House       of the Devil, or The Devil's Castle, or The Haunted Castle), although       it was meant to be an amusing, entertaining film.\nMelies became the film industry's           first film-maker to use artificially-arranged scenes to construct and           tell a narrative story, with his most popular and influential film           to date, Cendrillon (1899) (aka Cinderella).       He created about 500 films (one-reelers usually)       over the next 15 years (few of which survived), and screened his own productions       in his theatre. Melies wrote, designed, directed,       and acted in hundreds of his own fairy tales and science fiction films,       and developed techniques such as stop-motion photography, double and multiple-exposures,       time-lapse photography, \"special         effects\" such as disappearing objects (using stop-trick or substitution       photography), and dissolves/fades. In         late 1911, he contracted with French film company Pathe to finance and       distribute his films, and then went out of business by 1913.\nAn illusionist and stage magician, and a wizard at special effects, Melies          exploited the new medium with a pioneering, 14-minute science fiction          work, Le Voyage Dans la Lune - A Trip to the Moon            (1902) . It was his most popular and best-known work, with about          30 scenes called tableaux. He incorporated surrealistic special          effects, including the memorable image of a rocketship landing and gouging          out the eye of the 'man in the moon.' Melies also introduced the idea          of narrative storylines, plots, character development, illusion, and fantasy          into film, including trick photography (early special effects), hand-tinting,          dissolves, wipes, 'magical' super-impositions and double exposures, the          use of mirrors, trick sets, stop motion, slow-motion and fade-outs/fade-ins.          Although his use of the camera was innovative, the camera remained stationary          and recorded the staged production from one position only.\nFurther US Development:\nThe key years in the development of the cinema in the U.S. were in the          late 1800s and early 1900s, when the Edison Company was competing with          a few other burgeoning movie companies. The major pioneering movie production          companies, mostly on the East Coast, that controlled most of the industry          were these rivals:\nthe Edison Manufacturing Company - began producing             films for the Kinetoscope  in 1891, with headquarters and production             facilities in West Orange, NJ (see above); formally became a company             in 1894. Afterwards,  Edison intensely fought for control of 'his'             movie industry by harrassing,  sue-ing, or buying patents from anyone             he thought was threatening his  company.\nthe Selig Polyscope Company (originally called The               W.N. Selig Company), was founded in 1896, in Chicago, Illinois                by \"Colonel\" William Selig. Initially, the company specialized                in slapstick comedies, \"jungle\" films, historical subjects,                serials, travel films, and the early westerns starring Tom Mix.\nthe American Vitagraph Company, formed by British-born Americans J. Stuart Blackton and Albert E. Smith in 1896. The company's  first            fictional film was The Burglar on the Roof, filmed and released            in 1897. It soon became the largest film company, turning out 200 films a year.\nAmerican               Mutoscope Company, founded            in 1895 in New York City, NY by disenchanted Edison worker William               K. L. Dickson, Herman Casler, Henry Marvin  and pocket lighter               inventor Elias Koopman. Their first motion picture machine was               the Mutoscope - a peephole, flip-card device similar in               size to a Kinetoscope. Instead  of using film, a spinning set of               photographs mounted on a drum inside  the cabinet gave the impression               of motion. This was followed by a projector  - the Biograph               Projector, that was first demonstrated in New York City in               1896. It was the first time projected images from an American film               company were shown to an American movie theatre audience.  They               also devised a hand-cranked camera called the Mutograph (originally               called the Biograph) that didn't use sprocket holes or perforations                 in the motion-picture film. The company released its first film                in 1896, titled Empire State Express.\nSoon, the American Mutoscope Company became the           most popular film company in America. They were formally renamed the American           Mutoscope  and Biograph Company in 1899 (and simply Biograph by           1909). They marketed their own films and their new Biograph projector,           thus becoming the foremost motion picture company in the US. The American           Mutoscope Company's The           Haverstraw Tunnel (1897) became its most popular film - it was           the first \"phantom ride\" film in which a camera was mounted           on the front of a train, and recorded its passage into a tunnel.\nThey were also known for many firsts:\nthe early documentary Divers at Work on the Wreck               of the Maine (1898) - the first film shot in Havana, Cuba at         the location of the sunken warship\nW.L.K.

W. Griffith's epic Judith of Bethulia (1914)\nEdison Vs. Mutoscope:\nIn May of         1898, Edison filed a patent-infringement suit against the American           Mutoscope Company,         claiming that the studio had infringed on his patent for the Kinetograph movie         camera. [Edison’s competitors had developed other motion-picture         devices, which became the Biograph and the Mutoscope.]         After years of legal battles, in July of 1901, a U.S. Circuit Court         in New York ruled that Biograph had infringed on Edison's patent claims.         Biograph appealed the ruling, claiming it had a different camera design.         The decision was reversed in March 1902 by a U.S. Court of Appeals.         It ruled that Edison did not invent the motion-picture camera, but         allowed that he had invented the sprocket system that moved perforated         film through the camera. The new ruling essentially disallowed Edison         from establishing a monopoly on motion picture apparatus - and ultimately         on the making of films. By 1903,         most studios made films using  the 35mm format. (See more about the development         of Biograph further below)\n\"Moving pictures\" were increasing in length,       taking on fluid narrative forms, and being edited for the first time. Two       of the earliest westerns (or cowboy-related)       films were both Edison Manufacturing Company films made at Black Maria:\nthe one-shot (less than one minute short) Thomas               Edison's Cripple Creek Bar Room Scene (1899) - with the 'first'             western saloon setting\nPoker           at Dawson City (1899)\nBreakthrough Films of Edwin S. Porter - the \"Father          of the Story Film\":\nInventor           and former projectionist Edwin S. Porter (1869-1941), who in 1898 had           patented an improved Beadnell projector with a steadier and brighter           image, was also using film cameras to record news events. Porter was           one of the resident Kinetoscope operators and directors at the Edison           Company Studios in the early 1900s, who worked in different film genres.           Porter was hired at Edison's Company in late 1900 and began making           short narrative films, such as the 10-minute long Jack and the Beanstalk (1902). He was responsible for directing  the six-minute long The Life of an American Fireman (1903) - often alleged to be the first American documentary, docudrama, fictionalized biopic          or realistic narrative film, with non-linear continuity.          It combined re-enacted scenes, the dreamy thoughts of a sleeping fireman seen in a round iris or 'thought balloon', and documentary          stock footage of actual fire scenes, and it was dramatically edited with inter-cutting (or jump-cutting) between the exterior          and interior of a burning house. Edison was actually uncomfortable with          Porter's editing techniques, including his use of close-ups to tell an          entertaining story.\nThe Great Train Robbery (1903)\nWith          the combination of film editing and the telling of narrative stories,          Porter produced one of the most important and influential films of the          time to reveal the possibility of fictional stories on film. The film          was the one-reel, 14-scene, approximately 10-minute long The            Great Train Robbery (1903) - it was based on a real-life train          heist and was a loose adaptation of a popular stage production. His visual          film, made in New Jersey and not particularly artistic by today's standards          - set many milestones at the time:\nit was the first narrative Western film with a storyline,            and included various western cliches (a shoot-out, a robbery, a chase,            etc.) that would be used by all future westerns [Note: the same            claim was made for the earlier 21-minute Kit Carson (1903)]\nit was a ground-breaking film - and one of the earliest            films to be shot out of chronological sequence, using revolutionary            parallel cross-cutting (or parallel action) between two simultaneous            events or scenes; it did not use fades or dissolves between scenes or            shots\nit effectively used rear projection in an early scene            (the image of a train seen through a window), and two impressive panning            shots\nit was the first 'true' western, but not the             first actual western [Note: Edison's Cripple Creek Bar-Room              Scene (1899) was probably the first western.]\nit was the first real motion picture smash hit, establishing            the notion that film could be a commercially-viable medium\nit featured a future western film hero/star, Gilbert            M. Anderson (aka \"Broncho Billy\")\nIn an effective, scary, full-screen closeup (placed at either the beginning          or at the end of the film at the discretion of the exhibitor), a bandit          shot his gun directly into the audience. The film also included exterior          scenes, chases on horseback, actors that moved toward (and away from)          the camera, a camera pan with the escaping bandits, and a camera mounted          on a moving train.          Porter also developed the process of film editing - a crucial film technique          that would further the cinematic art. Most early films were not much more          than short, filmed stage productions or records of live events. In the          early days of film-making, actors were usually unidentified and not even          trained actors. The earliest actors in movies, that were dubbed \"flickers,\" supplemented their stage incomes by acting in moving pictures.\nNickelodeons: Expanded Film Exhibition\nIn            the early 1900s, motion pictures (\"flickers\") were no longer             innovative experiments. They soon became an escapist entertainment            medium  for the working-class masses, and one could spend an evening            at the cinema  for a cheap entry fee. Kinetoscope parlors, lecture            halls, and storefronts  were often converted into nickelodeons,            the first real movie theatres. The normal admission charge was a nickel            (sometimes a dime). Nickel- was attached to the Greek word for            theater -- \"odeon.\" Hence            the  name nickelodeon.  They usually remained         open from early morning to midnight.\nThe first nickelodeon, a small storefront theater or           dance hall converted  to view films, was opened in Pittsburgh by Harry           Davis and John Harris in June of 1905,  showing The Great Train           Robbery . Urban,          foreign-born, working-class, immigrant audiences loved the cheap form            of entertainment and were the predominent cinema-goers. One-reel shorts,            silent films, melodramas, comedies, or novelty pieces were usually           accompanied  with piano playing, sing-along songs, illustrated lectures,           other kinds  of 'magic lantern' slide shows, skits, penny arcades,           or vaudeville-type  acts. Standing-room only shows lasted between ten           minutes and an hour.  The demand for more and more films increased           the volume of films being  produced and raised profits for their producers.\nBut newspaper critics soon denounced their sensational programs (involving          seduction, crime, sex and infidelity) as morally objectionable and as the          cause of social unrest and criminal behavior - and they called for censorship.          They also criticized the unsanitary and unsafe conditions in the often          makeshift nickelodeons. By the early 20th century, nickelodeons were being          transformed into more lavish movie palaces (see more below) in          metropolitan areas. By 1908, there were approximately 8,000 neighborhood          theatres.\nThe First Feature-Length Films:\nIn the early years of cinema, film producers were worried          that the American public could not last through a film that was an hour          long, thereby delaying the advent of feature films (60-90 minutes in length)          in the US. According to most sources, the first continuous, full-length          narrative feature film (defined as a commercially-made film at least an          hour in length) was writer/director Charles Tait's five-reel biopic of a notorious outback folk hero and bushranger, The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906, Australia), with a running time          of between 60-70 minutes. Only fragments of the film survive to this day. Australia was the only          country set up to regularly produce feature-length films prior to 1911.\n[The film was remade many times, notably as          director Tony Richardson's Ned Kelly (1970) with rock star Mick          Jagger in the lead role, and as Ned Kelly (2003) with Heath Ledger,          Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush and Naomi Watts.]\nThe first US documentary re-creation, Sigmund Lubin's one-reel          film The Unwritten Law (1907) (subtitled \"A Thrilling Drama          Based on the Thaw-White Case/Tragedy\") dramatized the true-life murder          -- on June 25, 1906 -- of prominent architect Stanford White by mentally          unstable and jealous millionaire  Harry Kendall Thaw over the affections          of model/showgirl Evelyn Nesbit (who appeared as herself), Thaw's wife. The film was considered quite controversial for its sensational and scandalous story of murder and sex. [Alluring chorine          Nesbit would become a brief sensation, and the basis for Richard Fleischer's          biopic film The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955), portrayed          by Joan Collins, and E.L. Doctorow's musical and film Ragtime (1981),          portrayed by an Oscar-nominated Elizabeth McGovern.]\nThe first feature-length film made in Europe was          from France - Michel Carre's L'Enfant Prodigue (1907, Fr.), an adaptation          of a stage play, that premiered in Paris on June 20, 1907. The first feature-length film produced in the US was Vitagraph's Les Miserables (1909) (each reel of the four-reel production          was released separately). A second feature film, Stuart Blackton's Vitagraph          five-reel production titled The Life of Moses (1909) was also released          in separate installments.\nThe first feature-length film to be released in its          entirety in the US was the 69-minute epic Dante's Inferno (1911, It.) (aka L’Inferno), inspired by Dante's 14th century poem The Divine Comedy. It opened in New York on December 10, 1911 at Gane’s Manhattan Theatre. It was made by three directors Francesco Bertolini, Giuseppe de Liguoro, and Adolfo Padovan, took two years to make, and cost over $180,000.\nThe first US feature film to be shown in its entirety was H. A. Spanuth's five-reel production          of Oliver Twist (1912). The four-reel silent costume drama Queen Elizabeth (1912, Fr.) (aka Les Amours de la Reine Élisabeth) (starring Sarah Bernhardt) was          the third film to be shown whole, in its US premiere in July at the Lyceum Theatre in NYC. The five-reel Richard III (1912) is thought to be the earliest surviving complete feature film made in the US. Although US production and exhibition          of feature films started slowly in 1912, the next few years demonstrated          tremendous growth when foreign competition (with often superior products) encouraged development.\nFilm History of the Pre-1920s\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nWestern films have also been called the ...

Westerns Films - The Best Movies in Cinematic History Westerns Films\nWesterns Films\nPart 1 | Part 2 | Part 3 | Part 4 | Part 5 | Examples\nWesterns are           the major defining genre of the American film industry, a nostalgic           eulogy to the early days of the expansive, untamed American frontier           (the borderline between civilization and the wilderness). They are           one of the oldest, most enduring and flexible genres and one of the           most characteristically American genres in their mythic origins.\n[The         popularity of westerns has waxed and waned over the years. Their most         prolific era was in the 1930s to the 1960s, and most recently in the         90s, there was a resurgence of the genre. They appear to be making           an invigorating comeback (both on the TV screen and in theatres). Modern           movie remakes, such as 3:10 To Yuma (2007) and the Coen Brothers' True           Grit (2010) have also paid homage to their mid-20th century           predecessors.]\nSee all Greatest Westerns         Title Screens\nThis indigenous American art form focuses on the frontier West that          existed in North America. Westerns are often set on the American frontier during the          last part of the 19th century (1865-1900) following the Civil War, in a geographically          western (trans-Mississippi) setting with romantic, sweeping frontier landscapes          or rugged rural terrain. However, Westerns may extend back to the time of          America's colonial period or forward to the mid-20th century, or as far geographically          as Mexico. A number of westerns use the Civil War, the Battle of the Alamo (1836) or the Mexican Revolution (1910) as a backdrop.\nThe western film genre often portrays the conquest of the          wilderness and the subordination of nature, in the name of civilization, or          the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original inhabitants of          the frontier. Specific settings include lonely isolated forts, ranch houses,          the isolated homestead, the saloon, the jail, the livery stable, the small-town main street,          or small frontier towns that are forming at the edges of civilization. They  may even include Native American sites or villages. Other          iconic elements in westerns include the hanging tree, stetsons and spurs,          saddles, lassos and Colt .45's, bandannas and buckskins, canteens, stagecoaches, gamblers, long-horned cattle and cattle          drives, prostitutes (or madams) with a heart of gold, and more. Very often, the cowboy has a favored horse (or 'faithful steed'), for example, Roy Rogers' Trigger, Gene Autry's Champion, William Boyd's (Hopalong Cassidy) Topper, the Lone Ranger's Silver and Tonto's Scout.\nWestern films have also been called the horse opera, the oater          (quickly-made, short western films which became as commonplace as oats for          horses), or the cowboy picture. The western film genre has portrayed much          about America's past, glorifying the past-fading values and aspirations of          the mythical by-gone age of the West. Over time, westerns have been re-defined,          re-invented and expanded, dismissed, re-discovered, and spoofed. In the late 60s and early 70s (and in subsequent years), 'revisionistic' Westerns that questioned the themes and elements of traditional/classic westerns appeared (such as Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (1969) , Arthur Penn's Little Big Man (1970), Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971),  and later Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven (1992) ).\nWesterns Film Plots:\nUsually, the central plot of the western film is the classic,          simple goal of maintaining law and order on the frontier in a fast-paced action          story. It is normally rooted in archetypal conflict - good vs. bad, virtue          vs. evil, white hat vs. black hat, man vs. man, new arrivals vs. Native Americans          (inhumanely portrayed as savage Indians), settlers vs. Indians, humanity vs.          nature, civilization vs. wilderness or lawlessness, schoolteachers vs. saloon          dance-hall girls, villains vs. heroes, lawman or sheriff vs. gunslinger, social          law and order vs. anarchy, the rugged individualist vs. the community, the          cultivated East vs. West, settler vs. nomad, and farmer vs. industrialist          to name a few. Often the hero of a western meets his opposite \"double,\" a          mirror of his own evil side that he has to destroy.\nTypical elements in westerns include hostile elements (often          Native Americans), guns and gun fights (sometimes on horseback), violence          and human massacres, horses, trains (and train robberies), bank robberies          and holdups, runaway stagecoachs, shoot-outs and showdowns, outlaws and sheriffs,          cattle drives and cattle rustling, stampedes, posses in pursuit, barroom brawls,          'search and destroy' plots, breathtaking settings and open landscapes (the          Tetons and Monument Valley, to name only a few), and distinctive western clothing          (denim, jeans, boots, etc.).\nWestern heroes are often local lawmen or enforcement officers,          ranchers, army officers, cowboys, territorial marshals, or a skilled, fast-draw          gunfighter. They are normally masculine persons of integrity and principle          - courageous, moral, tough, solid and self-sufficient, maverick characters          (often with trusty sidekicks), possessing an independent and honorable attitude          (but often characterized as slow-talking). The Western hero could usually          stand alone and face danger on his own, against the forces of lawlessness          (outlaws or other antagonists), with an expert display of his physical skills          (roping, gun-play, horse-handling, pioneering abilities, etc.).\nSubgenres of Westerns:\nThere are many subgenres of the typical or traditional western, to name a few:\nthe epic Western (i.e., The Big Country (1958))\nthe 'singing cowboy' Western (films of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, see below)\nthe \"spaghetti\" Western (the \"Man With No Name\" trilogy of films by Sergio Leone)\nthe \"noir\" Western (i.e., Pursued (1947))\nthe \"contemporary\" Western (i.e., Hud (1963))\nthe \"revisionistic\" Western (i.e., Little Big Man (1970), Dances With Wolves (1990))\nthe \"comedy\" Western (i.e., Cat Ballou (1965), Blazing Saddles (1974) )\nthe \"post-apocalyptic\" Western (i.e., Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981-2), The Postman (1997))\nthe \"science-fiction\" or \"space\" Western (i.e., Outland (1981))\nInfluences on the Western:\nIn many ways, the cowboy of the Old West was the American          version of the Japanese samurai warrior, or the Arthurian knight of medieval          times. [No wonder that westerns were inspired by samurai and Arthurian legends,          i.e., Kurosawa's Yojimbo (1961) served as the prototype for Clint Eastwood's A Fistful of Dollars (1964), and Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai (1954) was remade as John Sturges' The Magnificent Seven (1960). Le Mort            D'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory also inspired much of\nShane (1953) - a film with a mythical western hero acting like a noble knight in shining leather in its tale of good vs. evil.] They were          all bound by legal codes of behavior, ethics, justice, courage, honor and          chivalry.\nWestern Film Roots:\nThe roots of the film western are found in many disparate          sources, often of literary origins:\nfolk            music of the colonial period\nJames Fenimore Cooper's novels such as his 1826 story The            Last of the Mohicans (re-made as a feature film at least three times            - Clarence Brown's 1920 version, a 1932 version starring Harry Carey, and            George Seitz' 1936 version with Randolph Scott, and most recently as the            popular film The Last of the Mohicans (1992) starring Daniel Day            Lewis as the heroic white frontiersman scout named Hawkeye, raised as a            Mohican)\nFrancis Parkman's The Oregon Trail (1849)\nSamuel Clemens' (Mark Twain) Roughing It (1872)\nBret Harte's short stories\ndime novels about Western heroes\nOwen Wister's influential The Virginian, published            in 1902, the first modern western novel\nprolific Zane Grey's (1875-1939) 60+ novels that inspired            dozens of films, including his best-known western Riders of the Purple              Sage (1918, 1925, 1931, 1941); also The Rainbow Trail (1918, 1925), George Seitz's The Vanishing American (1925) - the first film            made in Monument Valley, Rangle River (1937), The Mysterious Rider              (1933, 1938), Lone Star Ranger (1942), Nevada (1927, 1936,                1944), Western Union (1941), Gunfighters (1947), and Red                  Canyon (1949)\nother mythologies (tales of Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone,            Jim Bowie, Gen. George A. Custer, Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill Cody, Calamity            Jane, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Bat Masterson), and outlaws (such as the            James Brothers, the original Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Billy            the Kid)\nscreen cowboy Gene Autry's \"Cowboy Code\" (or            Cowboy Commandments) written in the late 1940s - a collection of moralistic            principles and values that cowboys reportedly live by, including such tenets            as: the cowboy never shoots first or takes unfair advantage, always tells            the truth, must help people in distress, and is a patriot\nThe most often-portrayed western heroes on screen have been          (in descending order): William Frederick Cody (\"Buffalo Bill\"),          William Bonney (\"Billy the Kid\"), Jesse James, Wild Bill Hickok,          Gen. George A. Custer, and Wyatt Earp.\nSilent Westerns:\nThe western was among the first film genres, growing in status          alongside the development of Hollywood's studio production system. There were          only a few great silent westerns, although the best ones established some          of the archetypes that are part of the genre even today. The earliest westerns          (silent films without the sound of gunfire, horse's hoofbeats, and the cattle          trail) are gems of American history. A few of the earliest western-like films were two shorts from Thomas Edison's Manufacturing Company:\nthe less-than 1 minute-long Cripple            Creek Bar Room Scene (1899) (with its prototypical western bar-room scene, and a barmaid played by a man)\nPoker at Dawson City (1899) (set during the Alaska Gold Rush, about  a crooked poker game with flagrant cheating that led to a fight)\nEdwin S. Porter's Pioneering Western:\nBut          the 'first real movie' or commercially narrative film that gave birth to the          genre was Edwin S. Porter's pioneering western The            Great Train Robbery (1903) . Porter (named 'the father of the story          film') was responsible for the one-reel, 10-minute long film, shot - curiously          - on the East Coast (New Jersey and Delaware) rather than the Western setting          of Wyoming. [The first westerns were shot, until            1906, on the East Coast.] Porter had also directed and filmed Edison's short publicity western-themed film A Romance of the Rail (1903).\nAlmost all the essential elements or conventions of typical          westerns were included: good guys vs. bad guys, a robbery or wrong-doing,          a chase or pursuit, and a final showdown, all in a natural setting. The film          ended (or began) with a stunning close-up (the first!) of a gunman (George          Barnes) firing directly into the camera - and audience. It was the most commercially          successful film of the pre-nickelodeon era.\nPorter's          film was a milestone in film-making for its storyboarding of the script, the          first use of title cards, an ellipsis, and a panning shot, and for its cross-cutting          editing techniques. One of its stars with multiple roles, Gilbert M. Anderson          (Max Aronson), later took the name \"Broncho Billy\" Anderson and          became famous as the first western film hero - the genre's first cowboy.          As in other genres, westerns quickly became character-driven and stars began          to be developed.\nPorter's other film in the same year was a non-Western, Life          of An American Fireman (1903) featuring more overlapping action and cross-cut          editing, and a last-minute rescue of a mother and child in a burning building.          And Edison's A Race for Millions (1907) also featured typical western          plot elements - a high-noon shootout, and claim-jumping. In fact, a number          of major film studios were making westerns as early as 1907, and by the end          of the first decade of the century, about twenty percent of all of Hollywood's          films were westerns.\nOther Early Westerns and Their Directors/Producers:\nThe American Mutoscope and Biograph           Co. claimed to have made the first western one year before           Porter's The Great Train   Robbery (1903) .           A few early westerns copyrighted by Biograph were the 21-minute long Kit           Carson (1903) and the 15-minute The Pioneers (1903). The           first western produced in the West was Biograph's A California Hold           Up (1906). Note: The first sagebrush sagas were either shot on           soundstages or made on the East Coast, until the wide expanse of the           West opened up for on-location shoots.\nD. W. Griffith dabbled in silent westerns at Biograph         Studios between 1908 and 1913,  producing such pictures as:\nIn Old California (1910), Griffith's first western-filmed western, followed by The Twisted Trail (1910) with Mary Pickford\nThe Last Drop of Water (1911), with the western's first            characteristic scenes of a wagon train siege and a cavalry rescue\nthe innovatively-filmed Fighting Blood (1911) about            conflict between white settlers and Sioux Indians in the Dakota territory            of 1899\nand Griffith's last major Biograph western filmed in S. California, titled The Battle of Elderbush Gulch (1914), a two-reel            pre-cursor to his most (in)famous landmark film,\nBirth of a Nation (1915) , with Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh\nThe first feature-length western was Lawrence B. McGill's          six-reel Arizona (1913). The first film to feature an all-Native American cast was Hiawatha (1913), made by the Colonial Motion Picture Corporation and based on Longfellow's poem.\nYoung Cecil B. De Mille's first motion          picture was The Squaw Man (1914), usually credited as the first feature filmed entirely in Hollywood. [De Mille remade the film in 1918 and          1931.] Even in the early days of the film industry, some real-life cowboys          and legendary western figures appeared in films:\nWyatt Earp in The Half-Breed (1919)\nBuffalo Bill Cody in The Adventures of Buffalo Bill            (1917)\nThomas Ince (1882-1924), known for inventing the studio system,          was the first studio executive who embraced the western in the teen years.          He arrived in California in 1911, where he produced detailed scripts with          new situations and characters for a vast number of classic westerns. In 1912,          his Bison Company production studios (known as Inceville) purchased the Miller          Brothers 101 Ranch and the Wild West Show to use their props and performers          for his assembly-line, mass-produced films. In the early 1910s, famed director          John Ford's older brother Francis was directing and starring in westerns in          California for producer Ince, before joining Universal and Carl Laemmle in          1913.\nThe First Westerns Super-Star of the Silent          Era: William S. Hart\nInce was responsible for discovering and bringing Shakespearean          actor William S. Hart (1870-1946) to prominent stardom by signing him up in          his New York Motion Picture Company. Hart served as both actor and director          after moving to Hollywood, and was often portrayed as a \"good bad man\" on the screen (with his Pinto pony named Fritz). He emerged as one of the          greatest Western heroes in the mid-1910s, until the release of his last film          in 1925:\nThe Disciple (1915)\nThe Taking of Jim McLane (1915)\nDevil's Double (1916)\nThe Return of Draw Egan (1916)\nTruthful Tulliver (1916)\nThe Narrow Trail (1917), Hart's first feature production            for Paramount\nBranding Broadway (1918), set in modern-day New            York City!\nRiddle Gawne (1918)\nSand (1920), reportedly Pres.            Woodrow Wilson's favorite Hart film\nThe Testing Block (1920)\nThe Toll Gate (1920), Hart's            first film with his own production company\nThe Three Word Brand (1921), with Hart playing three roles\nWhite Oak (1921)\nWild Bill Hickok (1923)\nSinger Jim McKee (1924)\nTumbleweeds (1925), Hart's best-known and greatest            western, by director King Baggot and from UA - about the Cherokee Strip            (Oklahoma) Gold Rush; the film's title referred to a breed of roaming cowboys\n\n"
