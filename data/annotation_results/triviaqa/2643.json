Finding the Day of the Week Finding the Day of the Week\nAbout\nFinding the Day of the Week\nWhen I was growing up way back in the '90s, I used to watch a show called \"Figure It Out.\" It was a sort of game show that would feature a kid with a special talent, and the celebrity panelists would have to, well, figure out what it was. On one episode, there was a boy who could tell you the day of the week that a given date fell on. I remember being absolutely amazed. I had no idea how he did it.\nIt turns out that it's quite easy to determine the day of the week from a given date. In fact, you can do it in your head with a little mental math and a few simple memorizations. Read on for a quick background on the algorithm. And don't worry: we'll get to the formula soon enough.\nOverview of the Doomsday Algorithm\nThe method outlined here is called the Doomsday Algorithm. It's not the only way to find the day of the week of a given date, but it lends itself easily to memorization. Invented by mathematician John Horton Conway (born 1937), the algorithm takes advantage of the fact that in any given year, there are certain easy-to-remember dates that all happen to fall on the same day of the week. Conway referred to this special day of the week as the Doomsday. There are other methods which, with some more difficult memorization and twisting of numbers, will lead you directly to your answer. However, by finding a year's Doomsday first, you can easily find the weekday of any date in that year.\nBesides the formula itself, all you need to memorize is a single Doomsday date for each month. Luckily, they're quite easy, and that's why the algorithm was based around them. In any given year, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, and 12/12 fall on the same day of the week -- the Doomsday. Conveniently, the last day of February (the 28th in a regular year or the 29th if it's a leap year) also falls on this day. It happens that 5/9, 9/5, 7/11, and 11/7 fall on the Doomsday as well. For those familiar with the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, a handy mnemonic for these months is, \"I work from 9 to 5 at the 7-11.\" Or you could simply remember that these are the odd-numbered months after March.\nWhat about the remaining months, January and March? Like February, their Doomsday dates hinge on the leap day as well. If it's a common year (a non-leap year), then January 3 is the Doomsday; if it is a leap year, then January 4 is the Doomsday. (You might remember that for three years, it's the January 3rd, and every fourth year, it's January 4th.) As for March, the last day of February is usually considered March's Doomsday date as \"March 0.\" (Keep in mind that a leap year is a year that is divisible by four: a year when we have the Summer Olympics and the US Presidential election. The exception to the rule is that years divisible by 100 but not 400 are common years: thus, 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but 1600 and 2000 were.)\nSo, to review, these are the only Doomsday dates you need to remember:\nMonth\n...2000s, 2400s, 2800s...\nTuesday (remember: \"Y-Tue-K\")\nThe two you will probably need to know the most are those for the 1900s (1900-1999) and the 2000s (2000-2099). You can remember that the anchor day for the 1900s is \"We-in-dis-day\" because most of us were born during that century. Likewise, you can remember that the anchor day for the 2000s is Tuesday with the mnemonic \"Y-Tue-K\" (remember Y2K?).\nThe Math\nYes, you do need to use a little math in order to do this. Here's the formula, broken down step-by-step. In this example, we'll find which day of the week July 13, 1989 fell on.\nDivide the last two digits of the year by 12. 89 divided by 12 is 7, with 5 left over.\nFind how many 4's go into the remainder evenly. 5 divided by 4 is 1, with a remainder that we ignore.\nAdd these three numbers. 7 + 5 + 1 = 13.\nDivide the sum by 7 and take the remainder. 13 divided by 7 is 1, with a remainder of 6.\nAdd the remainder to the century's anchor day to find the year's Doomsday. Wendesday + 6 = Tuesday.\nUse the month's Doomsday to find the day you need. July's Doomsday is 7/11, a Tuesday, so July 13 is a Thursday.\nLet's try another example by verifying that today, January 20, 2017, is a Friday.\n17 divided by 12 is 1, with a remainder of 5.\n4 goes into the remainder 1 time.\n1 + 5 + 1 = 7.\n7 divided by 7 is 1, with a remainder of 0.\nTuesday + 0 = Tuesday. Therefore, 2017's Doomsday is Tuesday.\nBecause January 3 is a Tuesday, then January 20, 17 days later, is a Friday.\nNow it's your turn! Find the day of the week for the following dates.

Congratulations!\nThere's a small catch, though. Your skills apply only to the Gregorian calendar, the calendar that we currently use. The Gregorian calendar was introduced by the Catholic Church in 1582. Before that, the less accurate Julian calendar was used. The only real difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars is that they have different leap year rules (all Julian years divisible by 4 are leap years) and differ by an ever-increasing number of days. Julian and Gregorian years usually have different Doomsdays.\nFinding a Doomsday in itself is relatively simple; the trick is to remember whether a given date is Julian or Gregorian. If you're working out the date that some event happened, it's important to consider where it happened. That's because not every country switched to the Gregorian calendar at the same time; in fact, only some Catholic countries adopted the new calendar right away. Great Britain and its colonies, which followed the Church of England, didn't make the switch until 1752. The last country to switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar was Turkey in 1926.\nIt's important to remember that, in the study of history, Julian dates are often not converted to their Gregorian equivalents. If a distinction between the calendars needs to be made, Julian dates are referred to as Old Style (O.S.) dates, and Gregorian dates are called New Style (N.S.) dates. Contemporaries of English thinker Isaac Newton would have said that he was born on December 25, 1642, and died on March 20, 1727. However, today we might say that he was born on January 4, 1643, and died on March 31, 1727. Though the dates are different, you'll be able to find that the corresponding days of the week are the same. Incidentally, the Julian and Gregorian calendars have the same days of the week at the same times; only the dates are different.\nTo find the Julian Doomsday, the first four steps are basically the same. When you add up the three numbers (the quotient of the last two digits of the year and 12, the remainder of that, and the number of fours in the remainder), subtract the century digits from the sum, and add that to Sunday. Here's an example for April 23, 1564:\n64 / 12 = 5, remainder 4.\n4 / 4 = 1.\nSunday + 10 - 15 = Sunday - 5 = Tuesday.\nApril 4 is a Tuesday, so April 23, 19 days later, is a Sunday.\nJulian dates are easy because you don't need to remember anchor days or the more complicated leap year rule. So, you should be able to try these:\nVerify that October 4, 1582 (Julian), and October 15, 1582 (Gregorian), occurred on consecutive days of the week.\nVerify that September 2, 1752 (Julian), and September 14, 1752 (Gregorian), occurred on consecutive days of the week.\nThe Battle of Hastings occurred on October 14, 1066.\nIn 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue. He made his first landing in the New World on October 12 of that year.\nEnglish poet and playwright William Shakespeare and Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes both died on April 23, 1616, but not on the same day of the week. Find the day of the week that each man died.\nAdvanced Techniques\nThis section is optional. It contains tips on finding Doomsdays more quickly if you're able to memorize more things.\nComplete List of Doomsdays\nIf you find it hard to remember some of the handy Doomsdays for each month, you might benefit from this complete list.\nMonth\nDecember\n5, 12, 19, 26\nNote that some other easy-to-remember Doomsdays are Valentine's Day (February 14), U.S. Independence Day (July 4), Halloween (October 31), and Boxing Day (December 26). Note, however, that February 14 is a Doomsday only in common years.\nMemorizing Years\nOnce you've done Doomsday calculations enough, you might start to memorize the Doomsdays for certain years. Early on in my study of the Doomsday method, I memorized that 1969's Doomsday was Friday. Why? I don't know; I just did. But it's helped me. Consider the satisfaction I got when someone \"challenged\" me to work out June 6, 1969, and I was able to tell them the answer immediately.\nIt may be convienient to know some of the Gregorian years whose Doomsdays are the same as the anchor day for their century. For example, 1945's Doomsday is Wednesday, just as 1900's was. In the Gregorian calendar, the following years of a century have the same Doomsday as the anchor day for their century: '00, '06, '17, '23, '28, '34, '45, '51, '56, '62, '73, '79, '84, '90.\nIncidentally, I've discovered that intervals between these years follows a pattern: 6, 11, 6, 5, 6, 11, 6, 5, 6, 11, 6, 5, 6. Using the 1900s as an example, the pattern actually continues into the next century: ...1984, 1990, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2018... This pattern breaks after 2100, probably because it will not be a leap year. It would be interesting to investigate whether any Doomsday (not just those that are anchor days) can be found as a member of a sequence, and whether this extends to the Julian calendar as well. I think the answer is yes to both, but I don't feel like crunching the numbers. Maybe someone reading this can prove it one way or the other.\nAdvance of the Doomsdays\nYou may have observed in the past that if a certain date falls on a Monday this year, it will be a Tuesday next year (that is, if the next year is a common year). The Doomsday advances one day each year, except in the case of leap years, when it advances two days. If you've memorized the Doomsdays for certain years, you can use this to your advantage. For example, you don't need to do the math for 1999 if you know that 2000's Doomsday is a Tuesday. Because 2000 was a leap year, 1999's Doomsday was two days before it and was therefore Sunday. Likewise, you know that 1900's Doomsday was Wednesday, so 1899's must have been Tuesday, and 1898's was Monday.\nAnchor Days for Future Centuries\nIf you're trying your newly found skills at a party, there's always going to be the snarky person in the bunch who asks you to find the day of the week for January 31, 6732. How are you supposed to find the anchor date for the 6700s? Recall that the anchor dates for the Gregorian calendar repeat every four centuries. (As such, the Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years. Just as January 20, 2017, is a Friday, so too was January 20, 1617.) If you divide the century digits (the first two digits in four-digit years) by 4, the remainder determines the anchor day. When you 17 by 4, the remainder is 1. Recall that the anchor day for the 1700s is Sunday. When the remainder is 2, the anchor day is Friday. When it's 3, it's Wednesday, and when the remainder is 0 (as in the 2000s), the anchor day is Tuesday. Now for the 6700s: 68 is evenly divisible by 4, so the remainder of 67 divided by 4 is 3. Thus, the anchor day for the 6700s is Wednesday. Now, you should be able to find the day of the week for January 31, 6732. Here's another challenge: January 1, 10,000. (For 5-digit years, the century digits are the first three.)\nDate Calculator\nThis calculator uses the Doomsday method.

Conway first published the algorithm in his article, \"Tomorrow is the Day After Doomsday,\" Eureka 36 (1973): 28-31. It is described briefly in a book that he co-authored with Richard K. Guy and Elwyn R. Berkelamp called Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays, Vol. 2, London: Academic Press, 1982. Since then, the algorithm appears to have been simplified so that the \"handy Doomsdays\" for the months are easier to remember. Conway now teaches his algorithm using the hand as a mnemonic. He himself can perform the necessary calculations in under two seconds . His secret? Besides being a mathematician, he has a program on his computer that gives him random dates to try whenever he logs on.\nThese resources have proven useful in the research for this page. They might also be useful for you if you've found this article just too confusing.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n... the day of the week for one day in each month of the year. Conway's method uses the fact that the following dates always fall on the same day of the week in any ... What is the day of the week? What is the day of the week?\nAST 309-TIME\nWhat is the day of the week, given any date?\nThis is really a nice trick. You can easily calculate the day of the         week, given any date in history, and with a little practice you can even         do it in your head. The method is based on one developed by John Horton         Conway, and is described in Winning Ways, a book that he wrote         with Berlekamp and Guy. It is described in Volume 2.\nPart 1-Within a Given Year\nThe secret of the method is to have a way of knowing the day of the week         for one day in each month of the year. Conway's method uses the fact         that the following dates always fall on the same day of the week         in any given year. They are easy to memorize, and once one has this down         pat, some simple calculations allow you to do this for any year. These         are the dates that always fall on the same day of the week.\nIn 2015, this special day of the week, which Conway calls \"Doomsday,\" was a Saturday.\n4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10 and 12/12 always fall on the same day of the week         (Doomsday) in any year.\nIf you memorize the phrase \"I went to my nine-to-five job at the         seven-eleven,\" you can also remember easily that 9/5, 7/11, 5/9 and 11/7         also fall on Doomsday.\nAlso, 3/0 (the zeroth day of March, i.e., the last day of February)         falls on Doomsday.\nJanuary and February are complicated by the existence of Leap Years. In         ordinary years, 2/0 (the last day of January) also falls on Doomsday, as         does 1/3; in Leap Years, 2/1 and 1/4 fall on Doomsday.\nAlternatively, you can use the Doomsday for the previous year to handle January and February, without worrying about leap years.         Simply note that 1/2 and 2/6 fall on the Doomsday for the previous year.\nIn 2015, which is a not leap year, therefore, the following dates fall         on Doomsday (Saturday): 1/3, 2/0 (1/31), 3/0 (2/28), 4/4, 5/9, 6/6,         7/11, 8/8, 9/5, 10/10, 11/7 and 12/12.\nSo, when was Christmas 2015? If 12/12 is a Saturday, then so are 12/19 and       12/26, so 12/25 has to have been a Friday.\nWhen was Valentine's day? Since this is a not leap year, 2/0, 2/7 and         2/14 are Saturdays. So, Valentine's day (2/14) also fell on a Saturday.\nOn what date did Labor Day fall in 2015? Labor Day is the first Monday         in September. If 9/5 was a Saturday, then 9/7 was a Monday, and this         must have been Labor Day.\nPractice: On what date did Thanksgiving fall in 2015? Thanksgiving is         the fourth Thursday of November. You figure it out, then check         with a calendar to see if you were right.\nPart 2-What is Doomsday for any year of the 21st         century?\nThe next and hardest part of the trick (because it requires a small         amount of calculation) is to determine Doomsday for the year in         question. Here's how to do it. (This is a new method, devised by Mike         Walters, that is easier than the method that John Conway originally         published):\nIf the year is 20xx, is xx even? If if is, set A=xx; if it is odd, set         A=xx+11.\nSet B=A/2 (A is always even so you can do this exactly).\nIf B is even set C=B; if it is odd, set C=B+11 (this is the same thing         you did in the first step). C will be an even number.\nDivide C by 7 and compute the remainder. Call this remainder R.\nCount R days backwards starting from Tuesday (which         is the special Doomsday that applies to this century). This gives you         the Doomsday for the year 20xx. From this point on, just use Part 1.\nExample: What was Doomsday in 2015? Well, xx=15, which is odd, so         A=15+11=26. B=A/2=13. B is odd so C=B+11=24. If we divide C=24 by 7, we         get 21 with remainder R=3. Count 3 days backwards from Tuesday         to get Saturday. Doomsday in 2015 was a Saturday (a fact we used in Part         1 above).\nExample: The World Trade Center and Pentagon suffered terrorist attacks         on September 11, 2001. xx=1, which is odd, so A=12. B=A/2=6, which is         even, so C=6. The remainder when dividing 6 by 7 is 6, so counting 6         days backwards from Tuesday (or equivalently, counting 1 day forwards)         tells us that doomsday in 2001 was a Wednesday. Therefore, 9/5 was a         Wednesday, 9/12 was a Wednesday, and 9/11 was a Tuesday.\nIn the 20th century, use the same rule, except count backwards from Wednesday instead of Tuesday. Wednesday is the special doomsday day for         the 20th century.\nExample: On what day of the week did D-Day, June 6, 1944, fall? Well,         44 is even so A=44, B= 22 and since B is even, C= 22. The remainder when         dividing C by 7 is 1 so R=1. In the 20th century count 1 day backwards from Wednesday so Doomsday for 1944 is a Tuesday. Since 6/6 (June 6) is         June's magic day, we now know that June 6, 1944 was a Tuesday.\nPractice: On what day of the week was Pearl Harbor bombed? It was         December 7, 1941. Hint: This is also a 20th century date.\nPractice: On what day of the week were you born? Calculate it using the         Doomsday rule and check it on a calendar or (if you already know it)         with your memory.\nPart 3-Other Centuries (Gregorian Calendar)\nThe Gregorian calendar, which is our civil calendar, was introduced in         1582 (1752 in English-speaking countries, and not until 1919 in Russia).         So one has to know whether the Gregorian or the old Julian calendar is         being used. The rule in this section applies only to the Gregorian         Calendar.\nThe only thing that changes in other centuries is that instead of using         Tuesday for the century doomsday as in Part 2 (for the 21st century), we         use another day that depends on the century. This century day cycles         over 4 centuries, so that it is the same in 16xx, 20xx, 24xx etc.         Specifically,\nIn years 15xx, 19xx, 23xx, etc., use Wednesday\nIn years 16xx, 20xx, 24xx, etc., use Tuesday\nIn years 17xx, 21xx, 25xx, etc., use Sunday\nIn years 18xx, 22xx, 26xx, etc., use Friday\nExample: On what day of the week did July 4, 1776 fall? First, calculate         doomsday: xx=76, which is even, so A=xx and B=A/2=38, which is also         even. So C=38, and C/7=35 Remainder 3 and R=3. The century doomsday for         17xx is Sunday, so counting backwards 3 days we find that doomsday for         1776 was a Thursday. Now July 11 is 7/11, which is a Thursday, so July         4, which is 1 week earlier, is also a Thursday. The Declaration of         Independence was signed on a Thursday.\nPractice: The Civil War of the United States opened with the firing on         Fort Sumter, which took place on April 12, 1861. What day of the week         was that?\nPart 4-Julian Calendar\nFinally, the same principles can be used if the date is on the old         Julian Calendar, which was introduced by Julius Caesar some 2000+ years         ago. The only difference is that the different leap year rule of the         Julian calendar means that the rule given in Part 3 has to be modified.         In years ccxx on the Julian calendar, we get the century Doomsday by subtracting cc from Sunday (i.e., counting back one day for each century).\nExample: In 1582 we find the Julian Doomsday as follows: xx= 82         which is even, so A=82 and B=41. B is odd, so C=B+11=52. C/7=7 Remainder         3 so R=3. cc=15 which is 2 weeks and 1 day, so we count 1 day backwards from Sunday to find that the (Julian) century doomsday for 15xx is         Saturday, and since R=3 count another 3 days backwards from Saturday to         find that the (Julian) doomsday for 15xx is Wednesday.\nThe last day of the old Julian calendar was October 4, 1582. Since         10/10/1582 (Julian) was a Wednesday, 10/3/1582 was also a Wednesday, and         the next day, October 4, 1582, was a Thursday.\nThe next day, October 15, 1582 (Gregorian), was the first day of the new         Gregorian calendar. Take the number R=3 that we just calculated         and  count 3 days backwards from Wednesday (the Gregorian century         doomsday for the 15xx dates) to get Gregorian Doomsday: That gives us a         Sunday. Now 10/10/1582 (Gregorian) would have been a Sunday if there         were such a date...So 10/15/1582 (Gregorian), five days later, was a         Friday, which is 1 day later than Thursday, 10/4/1582 (Julian).\nNote that this is the day after Thursday. This is important.         So far as we know, the weekly cycle of the days of the week has not been         broken for thousands of years.\nWe have found that Thursday, October 4, 1582 (Julian) was followed by         Friday, October 15, 1582 (Gregorian).\nPeople complained that 10 days were missing from their lives!\nPractice: September 2, 1752 (Julian) was followed in the         English-speaking world by September 14, 1752 (Gregorian). On what day of         the week did each fall? (Do the calculations separately and verify that         the weekly cycle was not broken when the calendars changed.)\nNote: I wrote above, \"if there were such a date as         10/10/1582.\" Actually, we can calculate backwards from the actual date         of introduction of the Gregorian calendar using the Gregorian rules if         we wish, and we designate such dates as being on the Gregorian Proleptic Calendar. \"Proleptic\" just means \"before this calendar was officially         introduced, but using the same calculation rules\".\nDay of the Week Calculator\nThis JavaScript example calculates the day of the week on the Gregorian         calendar for any date in the twentieth century. For date mm/dd/yy in         this century, enter mm, dd, yy below and click \"compute.\" To use it, you         have to be using a JavaScript-aware browser. You may use it for         practice.\nMonth mm\n\n"
