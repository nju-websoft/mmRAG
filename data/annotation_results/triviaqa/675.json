The feuding families become two warring New York City gangs- the white Jets led by Riff and the Puerto Rican Sharks, led by Bernardo. Their hatred escalates to a point where neither can coexist with any form of understanding. But when Riff's best friend (and former Jet) Tony and Bernardo's younger sister Maria meet at a dance, no one can do anything to stop their love. Maria and Tony begin meeting in secret, planning to run away. Then the Sharks and Jets plan a rumble under the highway - whoever wins gains control of the streets. Maria sends Tony to stop it, hoping it can end the violence. It goes terribly wrong, and before the lovers know what's happened, tragedy strikes and doesn't stop until the climactic and heartbreaking ending.

Looking over my tapes, I decided it was time to visit West Side Story again, after some years. It was a fine choice. I would catch myself with my hands idle, as my eyes tracked the dancing, the most dynamic part of the film. I reveled in the Sharks on the rooftop and the gymnasium dance. \"Cool\" was cool, as always. This is a musical that doesn't try to transcend itself. It just lets the music and dancing speak for itself (and offkey singing along is allowed at home). I've always felt that Richard Beymer was the weakest of the actors, and nothing has changed my mind. But he's easy to ignore in comparison to the outstanding performances of George Chakiris, Rita Morena (who dominates the screen and steals all her scenes), Russ Tamblyn and the rest of the supporting cast. I'll leave the experts to make the minute comparisons to Romeo and Juliet, and to the critics to point out all the flaws. I'll just say, let yourself drift back to the 50s, break out the popcorn and enjoy.\n33 of 51 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n1961 Academy Awards ... melancholy New York City playgirl Holly Golightly in director Blake Edwards ... and both of them had never won Oscars. 1961 Academy Awards® Winners and History - Filmsite.org 1961 Academy Awards® Winners and History\nJudgment at Nuremberg (1961)\nActor:\nMAXIMILIAN SCHELL in \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", Charles        Boyer in \"Fanny\", Paul Newman in \"The          Hustler\" , Spencer Tracy in \"Judgment at Nuremberg\",        Stuart Whitman in \"The Mark\"\nActress:\nSOPHIA LOREN in \"Two Women\", Audrey Hepburn in \"Breakfast        at Tiffany's\", Piper Laurie in \"The          Hustler\" , Geraldine Page in \"Summer and Smoke\",        Natalie Wood in \"Splendor in the Grass\"\nSupporting Actor:\nGEORGE CHAKIRIS in\n\"West Side Story\" , Montgomery Clift in \"Judgment at Nuremberg\",        Peter Falk in \"Pocketful of Miracles\", Jackie Gleason        in \"The Hustler\" , George C.

The film had eleven nominations and ten          Oscar wins (losing only its Screenplay nomination) - close          to matching the record established by\nBen-Hur             (1959) with its twelve nominations and eleven Oscars.\nThe Best Picture winner's awards included: Best          Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best          Director (Robert Wise and co-credited choreographer Jerome          Robbins), Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Sound,          Best Musical Score, Best Film Editing, and Best Costume Design.          Only two of its ten Oscars went to actors (in supporting roles).          Robbins was also awarded a special statuette for \"his          brilliant achievements in the art of choreography on film.\" Robbins          was the only Best Director Oscar winner to win for the only          film he ever directed.\n[\nWest          Side Story was the first instance in which a          co-directing team - Robbins and Wise - won the Best Director          Oscar. Joel          and Ethan Coen also won the Best Director Oscar for No Country For          Old Men (2007). Other examples of a directorial team being          nominated were Heaven Can Wait (1978) with co-directors          Warren Beatty and Buck Henry, and the Coen brothers nominated for True          Grit (2010).]\nThe other nominees for Best Picture included          the following:\ndirector Joshua Logan's non-musical Fanny (with            five nominations and no wins) with Leslie Caron and Maurice            Chevalier (co-stars in the successful Gigi (1958))            cast in the title roles as a young girl who finds herself            pregnant and her husband - a different older man\ndirector J. Lee Thompson's suspenseful action/adventure                     war film, The Guns of Navarone (with seven nominations                     and only one win - Best Special Effects) about a sabotage                     team of American-British-Greek intelligence agents sent in                     1943 to the fictionalized Aegean island of Navarone to destroy                     giant German guns\ndirector Robert Rossen's character drama about                     professional pool-room sharks and a naive, self-destructive                     pool hustler, The Hustler (with                     nine nominations and two wins - Best B/W Cinematography and                     Best B/W Art Direction/Set Decoration)\ndirector Stanley Kramer's three-hour long,                     star-studded Judgment At Nuremberg (with eight nominations                     and two wins - Best Actor and Best Screenplay) - a film about                     the 1948 war crimes trials following World War II\nThe Hustler accumulated          four acting nominations, but none of the deserving individuals          won.\nPaul Newman (with his second nomination)            probably gave the greatest performance of his career and            was nominated as Best Actor for his role as professional            pool shark Fast Eddie Felson. [Newman would have to wait            25 years to win an Oscar for playing the same character -            only older - in the sequel The Color of Money (1986).]\nco-star Piper Laurie (with her first of three                     career nominations) was nominated for Best Actress as Sarah                     Packard, Paul Newman's crippled, alcoholic girlfriend/lover\nTwo Best Supporting Actor nominees in The                     Hustler were:\nJackie Gleason (with his sole nomination)                         as real-life hustler Minnesota Fats\nGeorge C. Scott (with his second of                           four career nominations) in a superb performance as                           Bert Gordon - Felson's fast-talking, conniving, manipulative                           promoter/manager [Note: Actor George C. Scott in his                           third screen appearance became the first actor to decline                           an Oscar nomination (to be awarded in 1962). Though                           he wished to turn down the nomination, his name remained                           on the ballot, and he lost to George Chakiris for West                           Side Story (1961) .]\nThree of the four performers who won acting Oscars          were virtually unknown - Maximilian Schell, George Chakiris,          and Rita Moreno, and the fourth, Sophia Loren, was known mostly          as an Italian sexpot rather than as a serious, deglamourized          actress. The winning group basically beat out lots of better          known heavyweights.\nThe Best Actor winner was 31 year-old Austrian-born          Maximilian Schell (with the first of three career nominations          - and his sole Oscar win) as Hans Rolfe - a disturbing          Nazi-German defense lawyer who defended the Nazi generals for          war crimes in Judgment at Nuremberg. [Schell's role          was basically a supportive one, and he was listed fourth in          the cast. He became the first performer to win an Academy Award          for recreating on screen a role he had originally performed          for television.] He was the only performer to take home the          film's sole acting Oscar win.\nOther Best Actor nominees included:\nSchell's co-star Spencer Tracy (with his eighth            and next-to-last career nomination) as Judge Dan Haywood            - the presiding American/Allied judge in the Nuremberg trials            in Judgment at Nuremberg\nCharles Boyer (with his fourth and                     last unsuccessful career nomination) as waterfront proprietor                     Cesar (Horst Buchholz's father), in Fanny\nStuart Whitman (with his sole nomination)                     as Jim Fuller - a paroled child molester in the dramatic                     British film by director Guy Green, The Mark (the                     film's sole nomination)\nPaul Newman (see above)\nThe Best Actress award also went to a non-American,          to help acknowledge non-English language performers and boost          Hollywood's desire to favor non-American markets for films:\nSophia Loren (with her first of two            career nominations) won her only Oscar in director            Vittorio De Sica's sub-titled Italian film Two Women (1960)              (aka La Ciociara) (the film's sole nomination) in the            role of Cesira - the widowed and tormented young mother of            a 13-year-old daughter (Eleanora Brown) who she vainly tried            to protect in war-torn Italy during World War II. In the            Italian countryside during the taking of Rome, both of them            were traumatized and forced to survive an aerial strafing            attack, deprivation, and rape during the dark war year of            1943\n[Loren was the first to be nominated for          (and win) an acting Oscar for a foreign-language film role          - in a film that was not in English. This feat, a non-English          acting award, was also awarded to Roberto Benigni for his performance          in Life is Beautiful (1998). Also, Loren remains the only actress          to win an Oscar in a foreign-language film. However, it has          been noted that Robert De Niro also won an Oscar for his foreign-language performance,          speaking only Italian/Sicilian in\nThe            Godfather, Part II (1974) , and the same is true of          Meryl Streep's Best Actress foreign-language performance in Sophie's            Choice (1981), and Haing S. Ngor's Best Supporting Actor          role in The Killing Fields (1985) .]\nSophia Loren's other competitors in the Best          Actress race included:\nAudrey Hepburn (with her fourth of five career            nominations) in one of her best-loved roles as charming,            eccentric, melancholy New York City playgirl Holly Golightly            in director Blake Edwards' offbeat romance, Breakfast              at Tiffany's (with five nominations and two wins - Best            Comedy Score, and Best Song for Hepburn's rendition of Henry            Mancini's \"Moon River\")\nGeraldine Page (with her second of eight career                     nominations) as Alma Winemiller - a repressed Mississippi                     minister's daughter/spinster in another adaptation of a Tennessee                     Williams play by director Peter Glenville, Summer and                       Smoke (with four nominations and no wins)\nNatalie Wood was nominated (with her second                     of three unsuccessful career nominations) for her role as                     teen sweetheart and sexually-frustrated, troubled teenager                     Wilma Dean (\"Deanie\") Loomis opposite boyfriend                     Warren Beatty (in his film debut) in director Elia Kazan's Splendor                       in the Grass (with two nominations and one win -                     Best Story and Screenplay)\nPiper Laurie (see above)\nWest             Side Story co-stars:\nPuerto-Rican-born Rita Moreno (with her sole            nomination and Oscar win in her entire career) as the fiery,            headstrong, tempestuous, skirt-tossing dancer, a Puerto Rican            'Sharks' member, and Maria's (Natalie Wood) friend Anita.            She was the first Hispanic actress to win an acting            Academy Award. She was also the second performer            (after Helen Hayes) to win these four different awards -            Oscar (1961), Tony (1975), Emmy (1977, 1978), and Grammy            (1972) - by 1977, one year after Hayes.\nGeorge Chakiris (with his sole nomination                     - and sole Oscar win - in his first leading film role) as                     the 'Sharks' tragic, knife-fighting gang leader Bernardo,                     the heroic brother of the film's Juliet - Maria (Natalie                     Wood)\nAt the time, front-runner favorites were two          Supporting Actor/Actress nominees for their roles in Judgment            at Nuremberg - Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland - and          both of them had never won Oscars. The Best Supporting          Actor nominees who lost were:\nMontgomery Clift (with his fourth and last            unsuccessful career nomination) was nominated as Rudolf Petersen            - a Nazi-victimized witness who testifies for the prosecution,            in Judgment at Nuremberg\nPeter Falk (with his second consecutive and                     last career nomination) as Joy Boy in Frank Capra's remake                     of his own Lady for a Day (1933) (and Capra's last                     film), Pocketful of Miracles (with three nominations                     and no wins) - the film co-starred Bette Davis as down-and-out                     street vendor Apple Annie\nJackie Gleason (see above)\nGeorge C.

And the last film of          legends Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable, director John Huston's The             Misfits, received no nominations.\nThrough a Glass Darkly (Sw.) brought Ingmar          Bergman his second Best Foreign Film Oscar win, but was missing          from the Best Picture nominees.\nAlthough Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita had          a total of four nominations (including two for Fellini himself          for his direction and screenplay, another nomination for Best          Art Direction, and an Oscar win for its Best Costume Design),          Marcello Mastroianni was not nominated for his famed role as          handsome, world-weary, desperate gossip columnist Marcello          Rubini. [Later in his career, Mastroianni was nominated three          teams for leading roles in Divorce - Italian Style (1962), A            Special Day (1977), and Dark Eyes (1987).] His co-star          Anita Ekberg was also not nominated for her role as buxom movie          star Sylvia, who cavorted and danced in Trevi's water fountain          in a black evening gown. Her entire career was unrecognized          by the Academy.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nThe Oscars: the 87 films to win ... The film, set in 1950s blue-collar New York City, won 10 Oscars in total, ...

The Oscars: the 87 films to win Best Picture - The Telegraph The Oscars: the 87 films to win Best Picture\nThe Oscars: the 87 films to win Best Picture\nList\nTelegraph Film\n29 January 2016 • 7:00am\nAhead of this year's Academy Awards ceremony on February 28, we look back at every single Best Picture winner from previous years\nEverything you need to know about all 87 winners, from the longest (Lawrence of Arabia) to the shortest (Marty), including the film that beat Citizen Kate to win Best Picture at the Oscars .\n1929: Wings\nWings will forever have its place guaranteed in cinematic history due to the fact that it won the inaugural Best Picture Oscar for the 1927-28 award (a two-year eligibility period was used for the first six years of the ceremony). But this thrilling epic about a love triangle during World War I – for over 80 years, the only silent film to win Best Picture – merits wider recognition. From its archetypal Hollywood melodrama, to its dazzling depiction of dogfights, and a standout performance from Clara Bow as the plucky nurse Mary, the 144-minute runtime glides by.\nCredit: REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n1930: The Broadway Melody\nThe formerly little-known production company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM) was founded in 1924, and only five years later it had chalked up its first Academy Award win. The Broadway Melody – MGM’s first ever musical – tells the tale of Harriet (Bessie Love) and Queenie Mahoney (Anite Page), a beautiful vaudeville act who arrive at Broadway, and become swept up in New York high society. While it was wildly successful at the time, it seems audiences were more impressed by the mere presence of sound and Technicolor sequences, because the musical numbers are banal and uninspired.\nCredit: Reuters\n1931: All Quiet on the Western Front\nAdapted from the novel by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of the First World War, this film centres on a group of German schoolboys, who are convinced to enlist by their jingoistic professor. Director Lewis Milestone, who won a second consecutive Best Director Oscar for the film, made one of the most influential anti-war films ever simply by showing the ravages of war through the eyes of these young German recruits.\nCredit: Everett Collection / Rex\n1932: Cimarron\nPerhaps as a reflection of the movie industry’s growing prowess, RKO Radio Pictures invested more than $1.5 million into their production of Edna Ferber's epic novel about the history of a frontier family, despite being mired in the woes of the Great Depression. The Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 prompted thousands to relocate to claim free government land, and in Cimarron, Yancey Cravat (Richard Dix), takes his young family to build their newspaper Oklahoma Wigwam into an empire.\nCredit: Everett Collection/Rex\n1933: Grand Hotel\nReworked from former chambermaid Vicki Baum’s novel Menschen im Hotel, the film stars Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford as guests in Berlin’s grandest hotel. Joan Crawford once said of her performance in Grand Hotel: \"Little Joan was called upon to match Garbo, Beery and the Barrymores and she came off smelling like a rose.\" It’s difficult to begrudge the actor such an accolade given her showing as the glittering, ambitious stenographer Flaemmchen.\nCredit: Everett Collection/Rex\n1934: Cavalcade\nDirected by Frank Lloyd and adapted from the Noel Coward play, Cavalcade was a darling of the box-office and critics alike. It was even credited with the stirring up patriotism before that year’s general election. From the turn of the twentieth century, we view a changing Britain through the lives of two families: the swanky Marryots (Diana Wynyard and Clive Brook) and their staff, the Bridges (Una O’Connor and Herbert Mundin).\nCredit: Everett Collection/Rex\n1935: It Happened One Night\n‘Daughter escaped again!’ shouts the father of capricious heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) as she swims away from his yacht. On her way to one unsuitable man she falls for another: the struggling reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who offers her help in exchange for a society scoop. It Happened One Night won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director (Frank Capra) and Screenplay, making it the first film to win all five of the big awards.\nCredit: Everett Collection/Rex\n1936: Mutiny on the Bounty\nBased on a cycle of bestselling novels co-written by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, this rollicking movie became one of the quintessential nautical adventures. Directed by Frank Lloyd, it focuses on an eighteenth century voyage from Tahiti to the West Indies. Smarting from the cruelty of Captain Bligh (Charles Laughton) the noble first mate Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable) leads the crew of English conscripts to mutiny, and a new life on a paradise island. Being filmed on location, Mutiny on the Bounty blew its $2 million budget, but became the most profitable film of the year.\nCredit: Film Stills\n1937: The Great Ziegfeld\nRunning at three hours, requiring a thousand employees, and taking hundreds of designers six months to produce its costumes, Robert Z. Leonard and Hunt Stromberg’s The Great Ziegfeld is seen to epitomise the glamour and extravagance of Hollywood’s golden age. Inspired by the real-life Chicago impresario Flo Ziegfeld Jr., it charts the multiple rises, falls, rivalries and marriages of the charismatic showman, here played by William Powell. It was one of the biggest movies of the 1930s.\nCredit: Rex\n1938: The Life of Emile Zola\nWilliam Dieterle’s portrait of the famous French author was lauded by critics upon release, being proclaimed the best biographical picture yet made. A fictionalised account of the writer’s battle for social justice, the film centres on his historical involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, which saw an innocent Jewish soldier accused of treason to cover up the crime of a wealthy superior. But as it was filmed against the backdrop of the rise of the Nazis and their oppression of European Jews, people still debate whether the film could have done more to denounce anti-semitism.\nCredit: Warner Bros\n1939: You Can't Take it With You\nScooping Frank Capra his third Best Director Oscar as well as the Best Picture, You Can’t Take it With You is an adaptation of the Pulitzer-Prize winning play of the same name by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. The romantic comedy starring James Stewart and Jean Arthur follows a head-on collision of values and lifestyle when stenographer Alice (Arthur) introduces her eccentric and unmaterialistic family to the relatives of her fiance Tony (Stewart), who are wealthy, status-driven tycoons.\nCredit: Rex\n1940: Gone with the Wind\nWinning 8 Oscars including Best Actress for Vivian Leigh and Best Director for Victor Fleming, this classic adaptation of Margaret Mitchell’s 1936 novel remains the most successful film in box office history. Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and reconstruction, it follows the romantic travails of a plantation owner’s daughter, Scarlett O’Hara. It was an epic in every sense: over 1400 women were allegedly interviewed in the famous ‘search for Scarlett’, and Fleming was briefly replaced as director by Sam Wood, while he took time off due to exhaustion.\nCredit: Rex\n1941: Rebecca\nThis early Hitchcock thriller portrays a naive young bride, who marries rich widower Maxim De Winter, and soon discovers how he is still troubled by the death of his first wife, Rebecca, in a boating accident the year before. Rebecca’s death seems to have had an unnatural effect on all the residents of De Winter’s large country estate. Despite not including the one murder that takes place in the Du Maurier novel, the film still evokes all the psychological unease and suspense we would expect from a Hitchcock.\nCredit: United Artists\n1942: How Green Was My Valley\nOne of the few Hollywood blockbusters set in rural Wales, How Green Was My Valley tells the story of the Morgans through the eyes of their youngest son, Huw. The family live in a mining village at the turn of the century, and through portraying their trials and tribulations, the film also charts the destruction of the environment in the Welsh coalfields and deteriorating conditions for miners. Based on the 1939 Richard Llewellyn novel, the film scooped five Oscars, beating Citizen Kane in both the Best Film and Best Director categories.\nCredit: Rex\n1943: Mrs Miniver\nSet in a fictional English town, Mrs Miniver charts the effects of World War II on the lives of a rural housewife and her family. Though the men in her life go to war, her son signing up to join the RAF and her husband volunteering to take his boat to the Dunkirk evacuation, the women are still exposed to the conflict when a German pilot parachutes into the garden. The film won six Oscars, including Best Director for Walter Wyler, and earning Walter Pidgeon his first Best Actor nomination.\nCredit: Rex\n1944: Casablanca\nCasablanca is one of the best-loved films in all of cinema, and its denouement is one of the most quoted. Set in December 1941, the month Pearl Harbour pitched the United States into the Second World War, Humphrey Bogart's cynical bar owner rediscovers his lost political ideals when Ingrid Bergman, the woman he loved, and loves, walks into his gin-joint with a legendary resistance hero. Meanwhile, the movie features of some of the finest character actors of the era.\nCredit: Rex\n1945: Going My Way\nWartime America just adored this heartwarming tale of two country priests, and critics were as satisfied. Complete with singalongs from Bing Crosby, who took the Best Actor Oscar for his appearance, Going My Way won big during awards season. The film is about a young priest taking over a parish from an established old veteran, and went on to become the top-grossing release of the year ($6.5 million).\nCredit: Rex\n1946: The Lost Weekend\nThe Lost Weekend is a frank, taboo-breaking examination of alcohol addiction, which follows the life of a chronic alcoholic-cum-failed novelist (Phillip Terry) over the course of a long weekend. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay).It was Billy Wilder's fourth directorial effort, after The Major and the Minor (1942), Five Graves to Cairo (1943), and the classic film noir Double Indemnity (1944).\nCredit: Rex\n1947: The Best Years of Our Lives\nProducer Samuel Goldwyn's classic American film is about the trauma and social displacement experienced by a group of returning veteran servicemen (Harold Russell, Frederic March, Dana Andrews) following World War II. Unemployment, adultery, and alcoholism plague their lives in this bitingly-ironic film title. It sold approximately 55 million tickets in the United States, which equates to a gross of $24 million and remains the sixth most-attended film of all time in the UK, with over 20 million admissions registered.\nCredit: Rex\n1948: Gentleman's Agreement\nAdapted from Laura Z. Hobson’s bestselling novel of the same name, Gentleman’s Agreement tackles the subject of ingrained anti-semitism in America. When widowed journalist Philip Green (Gregory Peck) moves to New York City with his son and mother he is asked to research people’s prejudices against Jews, and adopts a Jewish identity for himself and his family. Noticing the difference in treatment he receives, and growing more aware of bigotry toward others, he reevaluates his own accepted ideals. Gentleman’s Agreement won three Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director (Elia Kazan) and Best Supporting Actress (Celeste Holm).\nCredit: Rex\n1949: Hamlet\nWhat better film to take Britain’s first Academy Award for Best Picture? Sir Laurence Olivier held his audience’s attention in his multiple capacity as producer, director, and adaptor of Shakespeare’s play. But it was Larry’s performance in the most coveted role in all of acting which made history. He doesn’t stop there. Did you know that Hamlet’s father’s ghost is him, too: his voice slowed down by a tape recorder?\nCredit: Moviestore / Alamy\n1950: All the King's Men\nA small-town man with big ideas, Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford) rises from self-taught lawyer to champion of his local people to State Governor. But on the way he loses what originally set him apart from the ruthless politicians he hated in his early, idealistic days. Corrupt himself, and disloyal to those who are most loyal to him, he tries to defend himself against those who would see him fall. Adapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren, John Wayne famously turned down the lead role, which meant that Broderick Crawford beat him to Best Actor when the awards came round.\nCredit: Moviestore/Alamy\n1951: All About Eve\nFollowing the advancement of aspiring actress Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) from fan girl to golden girl, the people she has crossed gather to watch her accept an award. This arch comedy about ambition in the theatre world garnered 14 Oscar Nominations, which would remain a record until Titanic came along in 1997. And had the Academy given awards to collective female casts, All About Eve would no doubt have picked up one for its combination of Baxter, Bette Davis, Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe. It is still the only film to have secured nominations for four of its actresses.\nCredit: Moviestore/Alamy\n1952: An American in Paris\nA fully technicolour musical based on a score by George Gershwin, An American in Paris would certainly have been a sensory spectacle of the highest order. Three aspiring artists and musicians try to make names for themselves in Paris, with Gene Kelly playing Jerry, an American WWII veteran turned struggling painter. One day he is picked up by a wealthy society belle (Nina Foch) who wishes to offer him more than just patronage, while Jerry falls for a girl he doesn’t even know.\nCredit: Everett/Rex\n1953: The Greatest Show on Earth\n\"We bring you the circus...\" opens Cecil B. DeMille’s large-scale technicolour, and bring it they did. The film featured the whole of Ringling bros and Barnum and Bailey’s Circus troupe, comprising 1400 people, hundreds of animals and over 50 cartloads of equipment and tents. General manager Brad (Charlton Heston) finds himself in a tricky love triangle when he hires The Great Sebastian (Cornel Wilde) to replace his girlfriend Holly (Betty Hutton) in centre-ring. The film caused controversy by gaining Best Picture over films such as Ivanhoe, High Noon and Singin’ in the Rain.\nCredit: Everett Collection/Rex\n1954: From Here to Eternity\nSet in 1941 in the months leading up to Pearl Harbour, this military drama won eight Oscars of 13 nominations. Montgomery Clift stars as Private Robert E. Lee Prewett, transferred to a barracks in Hawaii. When he refuses to join the regiment's boxing club, the captain sets out to punish him into submission, assisted by First Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster). Prewitt only has the support of his friend Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra).\nCredit: Rex Features\n1955: On the Waterfront\nSeen as the summit of his early movie career, Marlon Brando’s portrayal of longshoreman Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront won him his first Oscar. The film, about Terry’s struggle to stand against the corruption and mob control in the New Jersey docks where he works, also debuted Eva Marie Saint and earned Elia Kazan his second Best Director award. Produced at the height of HUACs investigation of Hollywood, many saw the film (which explores the nature of testimony) as an attempt by Kazan to justify his decision to name communist affiliates in the House.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1956: Marty\nErnest Borgnine plays lovelorn butcher Marty; 34, still living at home and under pressure from his parents to get married. His fortunes change when he meets school-teacher Clara (Betsy Blair) in a Bronx dancehall. This neat and compact character study, adapted from writer Paddy Cheyefski’s original TV drama takes place over a very short time-frame of a little over 24 hours, and won Cheyefsky best screenplay. Delbert Mann and Borgnine also received Best Director and Best Actor awards for their roles in the film.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1957: Around the World in 80 Days\nLike most films of the era, Around the World in 80 Days was a mammoth production, oozing American glamour, with over 40 cameos from the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Noel Coward, Frank Sinatra and Buster Keaton. David Niven stars as the unflappable hero of Jules Verne’s 1873 novel, assisted by the comedic butler Passepartout (played by prolific Mexican comedian Cantinflas). Producer Michael Todd claimed they shot in every location featured in the film, and the picture was touted as a chance for audience to admire the exotic. Interestingly, the iconic flight by hydrogen balloon was not a feature in Verne’s novel.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1958: The Bridge on the River Kwai\nAs part of a tourism drive in 2014, Sri Lanka rebuilt the replica bridge destroyed in an iconic scene from The Bridge on the River Kwai. In the film, the titular bridge is constructed by a band of British prisoners of war during World War II, who are ordered to do so to accommodate the Burma-Siam railway. Alec Guinness portrays Colonel Nicholson, an honourable but vain man in charge of the POWs, with great poignancy. From a budget of $2.8 million, the movie took $30.6 million on its first release.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1959: Gigi\nMaurice Chevalier thanked heaven for little girls, and we got a case of \"right director, wrong film\", as Vincente Minnelli's stupidly lavish Parisian tuner won all the votes, and his far superior melodrama Some Came Running got left out of the, well, running. As with many of Minnelli’s musicals, Gigi fulfilled the important winning criteria: an original score, well-sketched characters, and a bittersweet romance. The film is considered the last great MGM musical.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1960: Ben-Hur\nSomehow the makers of the first Ben-Hur film, a silent movie from 1907, condensed all the action into a nine-minute one-reeler. The 1959 remake (there was another in 1926) was a landmark achievement in grand biblical storytelling for the cinema, and lasts three hours and 32 minutes. Ben-Hur was the most expensive film ever made at the time, costing $15 million to shot in Technicolour. Its success ultimately saved MGM Studios from bankruptcy.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1961: The Apartment\nBack in 1960, to see someone on screen portraying genuine everyman anxiety – ie, not the camped-up Jerry Lewis kind – must have been something rather odd and special. In Billy Wilder’s darker-than-it-seems romantic comedy, Jack Lemmon (as CC Baxter) turns common-or-garden nerves into a revolutionary form of acting, his doleful stares and wildly gesticulating hands making for a mesmerising two hours, incorporating the subtlest kind of comic genius.\nCredit: United Artists\n1962: West Side Story\nIt’s impossible to begrudge the vertiginous energy and feeling that make West Side Story one of the great American musicals, and one radically told through dance. Jerome Robbins’s legendary choreography needs the biggest screen it can get; when the movie’s firing on all cylinders of music, lyrics and motion (twice: “America” and “Gee, Officer Krupke”) there’s little to touch it. The film, set in 1950s blue-collar New York City, won 10 Oscars in total, claiming everything from Best Picture to Best Costume Design.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1963: Lawrence of Arabia\nDavid Lean and Sap Spiegel’s epic, as well as being the inspiration for modern greats such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Martin Scorsese, is credited by most institutions and polls as one of the best films ever made. Famed for its beautiful desert scenes and its central performance by Peter O’Toole, it is also, at 227 minutes, the longest film ever to win an Oscar for Best Picture. A biopic of the controversial war hero T. E. Lawrence, it shows his progress from outspoken and learned intelligence officer to saviour of the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire during WWI.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1964: Tom Jones\nHenry Fielding’s bawdy 18th century epic is considered one of the first true novels, and this raucous adaptation was one of the most successful comedies of its day. Eccentric, too: it was noted for its unique mixture of cinematic techniques such as voice-over, silent-film set pieces and actors addressing the camera. Wrongfully kicked out of his home, the wayward but good-intentioned orphan Tom Jones (Albert Finney) travels to London to find his fortune, but on the way must negotiate bandits, the law, high-society intrigue, and a liaison with someone who might be his long-lost mother.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1965: My Fair Lady\nMy Fair Lady, which sees cockney flower seller Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) transformed into a gentlewoman by elocution teacher Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison), is lodged in our popular consciousness. Based on a musical update of George Bernard Shaw’s play Pygmalion, it broached the subjects of class and the relation between the sexes. Harrison took Best Actor for a role he had played since the inception of the original stage version, and musical numbers such as On the Street Where You Live and I Could Have Danced All Night remain classics to this day.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1966: The Sound of Music\nNothing is more evocative of the musical genre than Rodgers and Hammerstein’s The Sound of Music, here made famous by Robert Wise’s picture. Maria, a nun struggling to make a go of the religious life, becomes governess to a widowed naval captain’s children, teaching them the value of music before the Nazis invade Austria. The movie starring the legendary Julie Andrews won five Oscars and became the highest grossing film in history until that point, knocking Gone with the Wind off the top spot. Taking into account the standards of the day, it is the fifth highest grossing film of all time.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1967: A Man for All Seasons\nFred Zinnemann’s screen adaptation of Robert Bolt’s acclaimed play about Sir Thomas More was an Oscars smash, winning six awards, including Best Director for Zinnemann and Best Actor for Paul Scofield, who had played More since the theatre version. Once a beloved advisor and teacher to Henry VIII, More disagrees with his king over the divorce of his wife Catherine of Arragon. As Henry establishes the Church of England, he remains true to his Catholic conscience, refusing to recognise the King’s religious authority, and eventually dies for his principles. As well as making More a saint after his death, the Vatican unsurprisingly classes this among the greatest films of all time.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1968: In the Heat of the Night\nNorman Jewison’s dramatic portrayal of racism and murder in the American South stars Sidney Poitier as Virgil Tibbs, Philadelphia’s top homicide detective. While on a visit to Sparta, MS, Tibbs is arrested on general principles in the murder investigation of a prominent white businessman. On his identity being established, he is recruited to help the small-town team solve the crime. At the time, having a non-white actor in a lead role was so controversial that the crew couldn’t actually film in the Deep South, and instead recreated sets in Illinois and Tennessee. Despite this, the film was a triumph with critics, beating The Graduate to Best Picture.\nCredit: Getty Images\n1969: Oliver!\nThe musical adaptation of Dickens’ witty classic won five oscars of six nominations, including Best Art Direction, and Best Musical Score for Johnny Green’s arrangement of the broadway soundtrack. On escaping from the workhouse, orphan Oliver runs away to London, and is welcomed into Fagin’s gang of young pickpockets. Starring Ron Moody as Fagin, Shani Wallis as Nancy and Oliver Reed as Bill Sykes. It was the last musical film to win Best Picture until Chicago 34 years later in 2002.\nCredit: Rex\n1970: Midnight Cowboy\nThe only X-rated film to ever win Best Picture, Midnight Cowboy follows the journey of Joe Buck, a young Texan dishwasher who travels to New York in an attempt to make money as a ‘hustler’. Selling himself on the streets to little avail, he meets seasoned con-artist Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), and the pair strike up a working relationship. Ratso’s name would later be lent to Jim Henson’s wise-cracking muppet Rizzo the Rat. The film won Best Director for John Schlesinger and Waldo Salt scooped Best Screenplay for his adaptation of James Leo Herlihy’s 1965 novel of the same name.\nCredit: Getty Images\n1971: Patton\nSubtitled ‘A Salute to a Rebel’, Patton is a portrait of the flamboyant, and outspoken American military general George S. Patton, (played by George C. Scott) who is described in the film as \"a magnificent anachronism\". The plot follows his army career throughout World-War Two, from his leadership in Casablanca to the fall of the Third Reich. With his loud and colourful language and unabashed love of battle, Patton was a controversial figure, but one who very much suited the high-budget Hollywood war-film treatment. The film won Francis Ford Coppola his first Oscar for Best Screenplay based on Fact, and 6 other awards including Best Picture.\nCredit: Getty Images\n1972: The French Connection\nGene Hackman plays short-tempered cop Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle in this fast-paced action thriller directed by William Friedkin. Along with his partner Buddy Russo (Roy Schneider), Doyle tails two French nationals to intercept a large shipment of heroin. The film is inspired by the late 60s and early 70s drug trade, when swathes of the illegal heroin in the East Coast was smuggled in via France; Doyle and Russo were based on real life narcotics detectives. Containing one of the most famous movie car chases in which Popeye chases an elevated subway train, the film won 5 Oscars proving popular with both the critics and the box office.\nCredit: Getty\n1973: The Godfather\nThe option to present producer Albert S. Ruddy’s The Godfather with a Best Picture Oscar was an offer the Academy couldn’t refuse. Based on Puzo's eponymous best-selling novel, The Godfather is – with the possible exception of Goodfellas – the greatest and most influential film in the gangster genre. In 2007, it was ranked by the American Film Institute as second in their \"greatest films of all time list\", behind only Citizen Kane.\nCredit: Getty\n1974: The Sting\nIn the pantheon of great male cinematic double acts, Robert Redford and Paul Newman are up there with Laurel and Hardy. So memorable was their on-screen chemistry, it's easy to forget they only appeared in two films together. Their first collaboration, the lyrical, vaguely comic western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), was directed by George Roy Hill and saw Redford and Newman pour charisma into their roles as insouciant outlaws. Their next film was even better. A crafty, good-natured crime caper, The Sting (1973) reunited Hill with Redford and Newman and won seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1975: The Godfather Part II\nThe Godfather is great, but director Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather: Part II is greater. It's that rare thing – a sequel that doesn't just match but actually surpasses the original film. Not content with just recycling the same story, Part II illuminates and elaborates on the first part, adding a classically tragic dimension by using flashbacks to show the origins of the Corleone family, and then moving forward in time to show that same family ripping itself apart.\nCredit: Rex\n1976: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\nBeautiful, devastating and hilarious, Milos Forman's adaptation of Ken Kesey's classic novel is the ultimate \"buck the system\" movie. When smooth-talking prisoner Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) cons his way into a mental asylum to ride out his sentence, he hasn't bargained on the despotic Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). McMurphy's refusal to tow the line, showing inmates that they're \"no crazier than the average asshole on the streets\", leads to a battle of wills in which there can be only one winner.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1977: Rocky\nThe film that broke Sylvester \"Sly\" Stallone's career as a Hollywood's hottest property for macho leads was the highest grossing movie of 1976, racking up $225 million at the box office. 30 years on, and 16 after Rocky V, Stallone was tempted to reprise his role as boxer Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa in Rocky VI; it again punched above its weight, exceeding expectations to net over $155 million in cinemas.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1978: Annie Hall\nAnnie Hall marks Woody Allen’s departure from simple farces to what we now think of as a classic Woody Allen movie: a mixture of hilarity, philosophy and self-annihilation. Alvy Singer (Allen) is trying to work out what went wrong with his last girlfriend Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), and in so doing looks back into his own childhood and attempts to rewrite their relationship. It picked up four Oscars at the 50th Academy Awards ceremony, including Best Director and Screenplay for Allen, and Best Actress for Keaton. The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw calls it the best comedy film of all time.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1979: The Deer Hunter\nEvocative and distressing in equal measure, The Deer Hunter is often hailed by the critics as an American epic in the same class as The Godfather films. In an iconic, exuberant opening section, a tight-knit group of Russian-American friends celebrate together, looking forward to enlisting in the Vietnam war. The ensuing action shows, in another string of iconic scenes involving gambling halls and Russian roulette, what war does to them. With a memorable soundtrack including Frankie Valli and a theme played by classical guitar legend John Williams, and a stellar cast featuring Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep and John Cazale, The Deer Hunter picked up four Oscars.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1980: Kramer vs Kramer\nA touching film which focuses on the other side of family life, Kramer vs Kramer examines divorce and the impact for all involved. Ambitious ad-man Ted (Dustin Hoffman) is left alone to raise his son Billy after his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) announces that she is leaving them. Initially a struggle, over time Ted reevaluates his priorities and the father and son become close. But when Joanna returns over a year later to take Billy, the two Kramers battle for custody. Both Kramers, it turns out, won Oscars. The film won five in all.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1981: Ordinary People\nRobert Redford’s directorial debut earned him an Oscar, and dealt with a family’s grief in its various manifestations. The Jarretts, a well to do family living in Chicago, lost their favourite son on a boating accident. While the younger son Conrad spends time in psychiatric hospital and blames himself, his mother denies it ever happened. While most of the leads in the film received Oscar nominations or awards (Timothy Hutton got Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Conrad), Donald Sutherland didn’t for his role as the father, Calvin, which was seen as bad form.\nCredit: Moviestore/Alamy\n1982: Chariots of Fire\n\"The British are coming\" announced screenwriter Colin Welland as he won his Oscar for Chariots of Fire, a rousing classic about more British winners. Celebrating the success of the 1924 Olympics running team, it follows the path of two passionate athletes: Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a Jewish Cambridge student who finds in running a weapon against prejudice, and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a Christian Scotsman who feels God when he runs. Since it was released, people have been imagining Vangelis’ famous soundtrack whenever they see something in slow motion.\nCredit: Moviestore/Alamy\n1983: Ghandi\nA biopic of Gandhi’s life was Richard Attenborough’s dream project, and this film was the final result of two previous unfinished attempts, making the whole project a labour of nearly 18 years. The film introduces us to Mohandas K. Gandhi (played by Ben Kingsley in his second ever feature film role) as an English law student who forsakes all his worldly possessions to promote the cause of Indian independence from the British. The film won Attenborough both Best Picture and Director as well as five other awards and a further three nominations.\nCredit: Columbia Pictures\n1984: Terms of Endearment\nSimpson’s producer James L. Brooks’ cinematic debut charting the complex relationship between a Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) and her daughter Emma (Debra Winger) was the second highest grossing film of that year, being pipped only (although quite substantially!) by Return of the Jedi. Jack Nicholson won his second oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as ex-astronaut Garrett Breedlove, while MacLaine and Winger both garnered Best Actress nominations for their performances, MacLaine taking the trophy in the end.\nCredit: Kobal\n1985: Amadeus\nAn adaptation of the hit broadway production the film reflects on the events leading to the death of prodigal musician Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozarts arch rival Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recalls his sabotage from his current residence of an asylum. The film garnered 11 nominations, winning 7, including Best Director for Milos Forman. In opposition to the legend, Salieri pipped Mozart at this awards season, with Murray Abraham clinching the Best Actor oscar over Tom Hulce who played the part of Mozart.\nCredit: Kobal\n1986: Out of Africa\nMeryl Streep stars as Karen Blixen-Flecke, a Danish woman who moves to a plantation in a British East Africa with her new husband Bror (Klaus Maria Brandauer). Left to her own devices on a farm which is largely neglected by Bror, she meets and develops a close relationship local hunter Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford). The film is based on a Karen’s memoir, published under the pseudonym of Isak Dinesen. The soundtrack won John Barry his third Best Music oscar, while Sidney Pollack scooped Best Director, although Streep missed out on Best Actress, pipped by Geraldine Page.\nCredit: Kobal\n1987: Platoon\nDescribed as the first real movie about the war in Vietnam, Platoon drew on director Oliver Stone’s own experiences as an infantry soldier in Vietnam. Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) drops out of college to volunteer in the US army, and is sent with a platoon of other young soldiers to fight in Vietnam, where he quickly loses the innocent view of war he held before he left home. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger both received nominations for their roles as violent and ruthless commander sgt. Barnes (Berenger) and good-natured but utterly disenchanted sgt. Elias (Dafoe).\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n1988: The Last Emperor\nBernardo Bertolucci’s The Last Emperor surveys the story of a man who is shackled by his past. The Chinese Emperor Pu Yi (John Lone) inherits the throne as a little boy and is forced to exist incarcerated in the Forbidden City. This is a profound film about how politics can affect not only the masses, but an unusual person too. It won nine Academy Awards.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n1989: Rain Man\nProbably the most famous fictional savant is Raymond, Dustin Hoffman’s character in the 1988 film Rain Man. Raymond was based on a real-life person called Kim Peek who, despite having an IQ measuring just 72 (below normal), had a stunning memory, ability to read and recall information. Rain Man was heralded by viewers and critics alike winning the Golden Bear at the 39th Berlin Film Festival, four Academy Awards, and taking $350 million at the box office.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n1990: Driving Miss Daisy\nBased on Alfred Uhry’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Driving Miss Daisy traces the quarter-century long relationship between a Black chauffeur, Hoke (Morgan Freeman) and a matriarchal Southerner Daisy Werthan (Jessica Tandy). This is a complex and compelling portrait of old age, dealing with the thorny issue of race. It received nine nominations, winning four for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Makeup, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n1991: Dances With Wolves\nEpic, sprawling 181-minute films don’t tend to be the stuff of Best Picture winners, though star actor-cum-director Kevin Costner’s filmmaking debut was not your average blockbuster. Set in the 1860s, Dance with Wolves ostensibly follows Costner’s First Lieutenant John J. Dunbar who is wounded in the midst of the American Civil War, yet it contains much more: with a relatiely frugal $19 million budget, the film features 300 horses, 3,500 buffalo, 250 Indians, 150 cavalry, and 48 speaking roles.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n1992: The Silence of the Lambs\nThe Silence of the Lambs won all 'Big Five' Academy Awards, at the 1992 Oscar ceremony and was one of the biggest grossing films of 1991 thanks in part to Jonathan Demme's direction and Ted Tally's adaptation of Thomas Harris' second Hannibal Lecter novel. It was the performances of the two lead actors though - Jodie Foster, and in particular, Anthony Hopkins as Lecter - which really grabbed the imagination and eventually earned the movie, after a slow start, widespread acclaim.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n1993: Unforgiven\nStarring, produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, Unforgiven ranks fourth in the American Film Institute’s best Westerns of all time. When a prostitute is attacked by two cowboys in the town of Big Whisky, a bounty is put on their heads. William Munny (Eastwood), a one-time outlaw, takes himself out of retirement for one last job. The film’s conception followed the storyline: it was intended to be a last hurrah before Eastwood stopped creating Westerns, but the old gunslinger returned in 2014 with the controversial American Sniper, a traditional Western set on the battlegrounds of the Middle East.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1994: Schindler's List\nSteven Spielberg’s masterpiece about Nazi Poland almost wasn’t directed by him. Though interested in the real life story of Oskar Schindler, he didn’t believe he was ready to tackle the subject matter, and tried to pass it on to other directors. How lucky for us that none of other possibilities took it! Schindler (Liam Neeson), a wealthy Nazi businessman, comes to Kraków to set up a munitions factory, employing cheap labour from the city’s Jewish ghetto. When an SS overseer (Ralph Fiennes) is ordered to move Jews to a concentration camp, Schindler witnesses the extent of Nazi brutality, and begins to devote himself to keeping as many Jews alive as possible. The American Film Institute puts it in the top ten greatest American films.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1995: Forrest Gump\nThis epic begins with a man sitting on a bench, waiting for a bus and telling strangers his life story. The man is Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), eminently quotable for a generation of cinema goers, and his life features cameos from some of the century’s leading figures, from Richard Nixon and J. F. K to Elvis and John Lennon. A boy of below average intelligence with a good heart, he discovers early that he is a naturally gifted athlete, and later makes a brave soldier in Vietnam. The film took six Oscars and to this day divides critics, with half finding it heart-warming, and others finding it a little too sentimental.\nCredit: Rex Features\n1996: Braveheart\nAfter the Medieval King of England Edward I’s conquest of Scotland, English lords took increasing liberties over the Scottish people. After his wife was executed for refusing to sleep with an English lord, William Wallace takes vengeance, and becomes a beacon of hope to Scottish patriots. Though famously taking many liberties with historical fact, this epic boosted tourism to Scotland, and even increased Scottish people’s engagement with that period of their history.\nCredit: Ronald Grant Archive\n1997: The English Patient\nBased on the Booker Prize-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje, The English Patient won nine Academy Awards. Set in Italy during WWII, it explores the relationship of a French-Canadian nurse (Juliette Binoche) to her badly disfigured patient, Count Laszlo de Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) who relives his memories of the war in a series of flashbacks. The author was consulted by the film editor Walter Murch on how to achieve the complex play between timeframes, spawning a book based on these conversations.\nCredit: Photos 12/Alamy\n1998: Titanic\n James Cameron’s epic romantic disaster film set on the ill-fated british passenger liner RMS Titanic stood as the most popular film in box office history, grossing over $2 billion. It was only topped by Cameron himself, with Avatar in 2009. The all-conquering tragic romance between Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) was an entirely fictionalised account, however there was a J.Dawson aboard the original ship. It won 11 oscars, tying it with Ben-Hur (1959) and Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King (2003) as the most Oscars won for a single film.\nCredit: 20th Century Fox\n1999: Shakespeare in Love\nJohn Madden’s romantic comedy about William Shakespeare stars Joseph Fiennes, as the struggling poet and playwright searching for a muse. This he finds in the form of Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a passionate actor auditioning for all-male casts in the guise of Thomas Kent. The eighth British film to ever win Best Picture, it featured Judi Dench as Elizabeth I and Colin Firth as Lord Wessex. It scooped 7 oscars in all, with Paltrow and Dench securing best actress and supporting actress.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n2000: American Beauty\nSam Mendes’ suburban drama starring Kevin Spacey as a father in the grips of a mid-life crisis makes him one the most recent of only six directors to ever win Best Picture on their cinematic debut. Lester Burnham (Spacey) ever more depressed and estranged from family life, becomes infatuated with his daughter’s best friend Angela (Mena Suvari). The film won five oscars including Best Actor for Kevin Spacey, and beat The Green Mile to Best Picture.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n2001: Gladiator\nRussell Crowe plays a Maximus, a Roman army general in the year 180. The subsequent chaos after the death of Marcus Aurelius leads to him being sentenced to execution, and losing all his wealth and status. He escapes and becomes a gladiator, determined to avenge himself against Aurelius’ son and return himself to his former glory. The epic production was a hit at the worldwide box office, being topped only by Mission Impossible: II.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n2002: A Beautiful Mind\nBased loosely on the biography of nobel-prize winning mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., A Beautiful Mind charts his meteoric rise and initial promise studying at Princeton in the 1940s, to his Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994. In between he suffers highs and lows, dealing with his asocial tendencies and schizophrenia. Jennifer Connolly won Best Supporting actress for her role as his student and later wife, Alicia, and the film earned Ron Howard his first Best Director oscar.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n2003: Chicago\nThe Chicago of director Rob Marshall’s is a hard-edged Prohibition-era city far from the one depicted in High Fidelity two years before. Killers on the run Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger), however, charm their way to the top – and away from death row – by becoming Vaudeville stars. Adapted by screenwriter Bill Condon, Chicago won six Academy Awards in 2003, including Best Picture (the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1969).\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n2004: The Lord of the Rings - Return of the King\nThe Lord of the Rings trilogy was probably the greatest gamble in filmmaking history. Executives at New Line Cinema risked the entire studio by giving Peter Jackson – a New Zealander known mainly for a handful of zombie films and the real-life drama Heavenly Creatures – $300 million and a free hand to make all three films at once. The denouement to JRR Tolkien’s trilogy, however, turned out to be Jackson’s favourite, and the one that finally scooped a Best Picture Oscar for its troubles.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n2005: Million Dollar Baby\nActor-director Clint Eastwood stars as Frankie Dunn, a virtuoso veteran trainer, who one day takes on pocket rocket Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank). The screenplay was written by Paul Haggis, and loosely based on a series of short stories by the former fight manager Jerry Boyd.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n2006: Crash\nNot to be mistaken for David Cronenberg’s psychological thriller of the same name, writer-director Paul Haggis’s Crash is about a handful of Los Angeles residents, whose trajectories come to collide in a 36-hour period. The city is amid a race relation storm, playing on racial and identity politics, as a Caucasian district attorney and his wife are carjacked by two black men. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Paul Haggis.\nCredit: Moviestore/Rex\n2007: The Departed\nMartin Scorsese continued his domination of the Oscars with this bloody remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, with young undercover policeman Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by Irish gang chief Frank Costello. It was not immediately considered an Oscar contender due to its graphic violent content, though many credited its heavyweight PR campaign for the eventual victory (the film’s budget was $90 million).\nCredit: Film Stills\n2008: No Country for Old Men\nThis Coen Brothers film, for many critics, established the directors as among the very best. Shot in the arid badlands of Texas, it is an up-to-date incarnation of the Western. After stumbling across a bag of money, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is hunted by the assassin Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), one of the scariest characters in modern cinema, who flips a coin to decide whether he will kill people he meets along the way. Watching it, for many, was a truly gripping and unsettling experience, leading some to say that Alfred Hitchcock himself couldn’t have made it more menacing.\nCredit: Film Stills\n2009: Slumdog Millionaire\nHaving done brilliantly on the gameshow Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, Jamal (Dev Patel), a teenage boy from the slums of Mumbai, must prove he hasn’t cheated. Questioned by police backstage before the final question, he details how he knows every answer, and in explaining tells the story of his life: from picking pockets, his gangster brother who worked his way out of the slums, and the love of his life. Danny Boyle’s film met praise across the board from audiences, though many Indian critics found it patronising, saying it showcased only the bad parts of Mumbai and Indian cinema.\nCredit: Film Stills\n2010: The Hurt Locker\n\"Every time you suit up,\" says one bomb disposal expert to another, \"it’s life or death.\" Sergeant First Class William James is brought in to head up an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in Iraq after his predecessor is blown up. A man who loves the adrenaline of his job more than anything else in his life, his colleagues fear him. But when he believes a local child has been killed, he takes his team on a private war. With The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win Best Director. Strangely, it is the \"lowest-grossing movie to ever win Best Picture.\"\nCredit: Film Stills\n2011: The King's Speech\nThe charismatic King Edward VIII is provoking scandal by courting a divorced woman, and his brother, the shy and stuttering Prince Albert (Colin Firth), might have to replace him. He is persuaded to see a speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), and so begins an unlikely and life-long friendship. Veteran Hollywood screenwriter David Seidler tracked down the son of Logue and was shown his notebooks, but in order to write about what he found he needed permission from the Queen Mother, who requested that he wait till after her death. This uplifting film bagged a Best Actor award for English darling Colin Firth.\nCredit: Film Stills\n2012: The Artist\nThe Artist is a modern silent film, depicting the point in the late Twenties when silent films were on the way out. George Valentine (Jean Dujardin) is a Hollywood star at the height of his fame, when a chance meeting leads to him helping out the career of Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), an aspiring dancer and actress. Their two trajectories pass as Valentine refuses to take part in the new ‘talkies,’ and Miller becomes the bigger star. As Valentine eventually comes round to the idea of talkies, the film becomes one. Jean Dujardin became the first French actor to receive a Best Actor award.\nCredit: Film Stills\n2013: Argo\nBased on a true CIA covert operation which was unknown to the public for years, Argo tells the story of CIA ‘exfiltration’ expert Tony Mendez, in his attempt to smuggle six Americans out of Iran during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, under the guise of a Hollywood film producer. Starring, produced and directed by Ben Affleck, the film won awards for Writing, Editing and Screenplay. In order to make it look authentically 1970s, it was shot on traditional film, with each frame being cut and then blown up to increase graininess.\nCredit: Film Stills\n2014: 12 Years a Slave\nAdapted from Solomon Northrup’s 1853 memoir of the same title, 12 Years a Slave tells the harrowing tale of an African-American musician living in New York State, who is kidnapped, put on the slave-market in Louisiana, and sold to a plantation.

The aggressive gang members leave the ... West Side Story (1961) - Greatest Films - Filmsite.org West Side Story (1961)\nPages: ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 )\nBackground\nWest Side Story (1961) is an energetic, widely-acclaimed,      melodramatic musical - a modern-day, loose re-telling of Shakespeare's Romeo      and Juliet tragedy of feuding families, although the setting is the Upper      West Side of New York City in the late 1950s with conflict between rival street      gangs rather than families. West Side Story is still one of the best      film adaptations of a musical ever created, and the finest musical film of      the 60s. It arrived at a time when the silver screen was realizing tremendous      competition from TV and other genres of cinematic entertainment.\nLike many other musicals of its time, Hollywood again looked      to a successful Broadway stage play (first starring Carol Lawrence and Larry      Kert) for its source material (e.g., in earlier years, South Pacific (1958), Oklahoma! (1955), and Carousel (1956) were chosen, among others)      and it was no different for this film. An almost completely new cast was assembled,      except for actor George Chakiris (who played Riff, NOT Bernardo, in the London      production). After her success in Spendor in the Grass      (1961) , Natalie Wood was chosen for the lead female role after Barbara      Luna was considered. And Richard Beymer, known for his performance as Peter      Van Daan in George Stevens' The Diary of Anne Frank (1959), took the      lead male role which was also considered for Marlon Brando and Elvis Presley.      Chita Rivera, the Broadway actress who played the part of the tempestuous      Anita, was replaced by Rita Moreno, known for her role as Tuptim in The      King and I (1956) . Supporting actor Russ Tamblyn, known for many roles      in films such as Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954) and Peyton      Place (1957), played the role of Riff.\nThe same tale has been told numerous times in past cinematic      history, including:\nRomeo and Juliet (1916) with vampish Theda Bara        as Juliet\nRomeo and Juliet (1916) with Francis X. Bushman        as Romeo\nGeorge Cukor's Romeo and Juliet (1936) with elderly        'teen' lovers Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer, John Barrymore as Mercutio,        Edna May Oliver as the Nurse, and Basil Rathbone as Tybalt\nRenato Castellani's Romeo and Juliet (1954) with        Laurence Harvey and Susan Shentall in the leads\nPaul Czinner's Romeo and Juliet (1966), with ballet        dancers Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn\nFranco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet        (1968) , with appropriately-aged star-crossed lovers Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey\nBaz Luhrmann's hip and updated William Shakespeare's        Romeo + Juliet (1996) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes\nThe ground-breaking, dynamic film of 1961 was based on the      successful Broadway hit - a staged musical play (opening in 1957) by writer      Arthur Laurents and directed/choreographed by Jerome Robbins. The play reworked      the traditional love story material (of lovers that crossed racial/ethnic      barriers) and translated it, in a radical, novel and revolutionary style for      a musical, to include racial strife between rival New York street gangs (newly-arrived      Puerto Ricans and second-generation Americans from white European immigrant      families), juvenile delinquency and inner-city problems of the mid-twentieth      century - in exhilarating musical and dance form. To capture the realism of      the social tragedy and its urban environment, some of the film was shot on      location in Manhattan (in abandoned West Side tenements around 110th St.,      and other settings), but most of it was actually filmed on sound stages with      stylized, artificial studio sets.\n[From Shakespearean Play to Screen: The Montagues became        the Anglo Jets street gang, while the Capulets were transformed into rival        Puerto Ricans. Puerto Rican Maria, played by Natalie Wood, and white Tony,        played by Richard Beymer, were the two lovers. The killing of Riff by Maria's        brother Bernardo paralleled the killing of Romeo's friend Mercutio by Juliet's        cousin Tybalt, and the retaliatory murder of Bernardo by Tony was identified        with Romeo's killing of Tybalt. Secondary characters were also modified        - the Nurse became Anita, Juliet's friend and confidante, and Friar Lawrence        became Doc, the neighborhood drugstore owner. (However, there wasn't a climactic        double-suicide in the musical.)]\nThe stage book was rewritten and adapted for the screen       by Ernest Lehman, and the film retained the beautiful and electrifying       musical score, songs and lyrics of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim.       It was co-directed by two clashing individuals from the start - veteran       director Robert Wise and exciting choreographer Jerome Robbins. Both shared       credit for the film's direction although Robbins was removed after a few       months due to schedule delays, the over-budget production, disagreements       with Wise over the film's degree of faithfulness to the stage production,       and Robbins' potentially-expensive demands for perfection. The four kinetic       dance sequences that Robbins choreographed (\"Prologue,\" \"America,\" \"Cool,\" and \"Something's      Comin'\") and the jazzy, interpretative score of Bernstein rhythmically     communicate the passionate intensity, frustration and tough violence of the     streets.\nThe singing of both leads was dubbed: Jimmy Bryant for former       child actor Richard Beymer, and Marni Nixon for Natalie Wood, and the vocals       by Rita Moreno were enhanced by Betty Wand for \"A Boy Like That\".       [Marni Nixon also dubbed Audrey Hepburn's singing voice in My Fair      Lady (1964) .] (Visit the official West Side Story website at: http://www.westsidestory.com .)\nThe much-praised, box-office blockbuster for United       Artists received eleven Academy Award nominations and won all but one -       Best Adapted Screenplay. Its achievement as a ten Oscar winner has only       been surpassed by three films (all with eleven Oscars): Ben-Hur       (1959) , Titanic      (1997), and The Lord of the Rings: Return of the     King (2003). West Side Story's     Oscar awards include: Best Picture, Best Director (Wise and Robbins - the first time     that awards went to co-directors), Best Supporting Actor and Actress (George     Chakiris in his first major film role and Rita Moreno), Best Color Cinematography,     Best Color Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Sound, Best Scoring of a Musical     Picture, Best Film Editing,  and Best Color Costume Design. Robbins was also     awarded a special statuette  for \"his brilliant achievements in the art of     choreography on film.\" Robbins was the only Best Director Oscar winner     to win for the only film he ever directed. Robert Wise won his second directorial     Oscar for The Sound      of Music (1965) . Natalie Wood was un-nominated for West Side      Story,      but she was competing for a Best Actress Oscar (that she lost to Sophia Loren       for Two Women) for her role in Spendor in   the  Grass (1961) .\n[The Oscar-winning short film West Bank         Story (2006) parodied the film, with Israeli and Palestinian gangs replacing the second generation       Americans and Puerto Rican gangs - fighting over falafel stands.]\nThe Story\nDuring the opening prologue, a breathtaking aerial shot of Manhattan from      a bird's eye view captures the city with its bridge traffic and highway ramps,      its waterfront docks, parks and skyscrapers. The camera passes over recognizable      landmarks as it moves steadily to the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and then      speedily zooms down and plunges into a concrete playground. A gang of 'cool'      white youths are posed together in one corner of a basketball court, clicking      their fingers to the syncopated rhythm of the musical score. The aggressive      gang members leave the fenced-in playground and cross the tenement street.\nIn the famous, dazzling opening sequence, they gradually break into a highly-stylized      dance and then burst into a daring, high-stepping sequence - an exhilarating,      inventive, visual ballet of pirouettes, vigorous athletic moves, and running      jumps that symbolizes their dominance and energy - they are readying themselves      for a gang brawl.\nThey are members of the Jets composed of white teens, led by brown-haired,      All-American type Riff (Russ Tamblyn). [They represent one side of the racial      rivalry, similar to Shakespeare's tense and feuding families, the Montagues      and the Capulets.] Two of the gang members face off against one member of      a rival gang, Sharks leader Bernardo (George Chakiris), a darker-skinned,      black-haired Puerto Rican immigrant. He is joined by his gang members, and      they pick up the beat by clicking their fingers. The gangs both are vying      for control of the streets, alternating between dominance and submission.      Two of the members provoke each other, and after an extended confrontation,      a full-scale brawl breaks out when the Jets come to rescue Baby John (Eliot      Feld), the youngest member of their gang, from an assault by the Sharks.\nThe conflict is broken up by the arrival of a precinct patrol       car, carrying uniformed Officer Krupke (William Bramley) and bigoted, plainclothes       policeman Lieutenant Schrank (Simon Oakland) who have stopped similar fights     between the \"punks\" many times before:\nSchrank: You hoodlums don't own these streets. And I've had all        the rough-house I can put up with around here. You want to kill each other?        Kill each other, but you ain't gonna do it on my beat. Are there any questions?\nBernardo: Yes, sir. Would you mind translating that into Spanish?\nSchrank: Get your friends out of here, Bernardo - and stay out - please.\nBernardo: (to his gang) OK Sharks, vaminos.\nSchrank: Boy, as if this neighborhood wasn't crummy enough. (to the Jets)        Now look, fellas. Fellas? Look, let's be reasonable, huh? If I don't get a        little law and order around here, I get busted down to a traffic corner. And        your friend don't like traffic corners. So that means you're gonna start makin'        nice with the PRs [Puerto Ricans] from now on. I said nice - GET IT! 'Cause        if you don't, and I catch any of ya doing any more brawlin' in my territory,        I'm gonna personally beat the living crud out of each and every one of yas        and see that you go to the can and rot there. Say goodbye to the nice boys,        Krupke.\nKrupke: Goodbye boys.\nRiff speaks to his gang members and arouses their immature gang mentality.      He directs his hatred toward the Puerto Ricans and their turf-encroachment.      Convinced of the Jets' own strength and invincibility, he is adamant about      checking the Sharks' expansion and influence in the neighborhood while still      avoiding a life-threatening rumble with blades or zip guns. However, Riff      would consider battling the rivals with weapons if challenged:\nRiff: Now we fought hard for this turf and we ain't just gonna        give it up...The Emeralds claimed it. We shut 'em out. The Hawks, remember,        they tried to take it away, and we knocked 'em down to the cellar.\nMembers: Yeah, but these PRs are different. They multiply. They keep comin'.        Like cockroaches. Close the windows. Shut the doors. They're eatin' our food.        They're breathin' all the air. The end to free enterprise...\nRiff: Hey, you heard what that Lieutenant Schrank said, eh? We gotta make        nice with 'em Puerto Ricans or else. We gotta let 'em move in right under        our noses and take it all away from us, or else.\nGang: No!\nRiff: You're damned right NO. So what are we gonna do buddy-boys? I'll tell        ya what we're gonna do. We're gonna speed fast. We're gonna move like lightnin'.        And we're gonna clean them Sharks up once and for all so they ain't never        gonna set foot on our turf again. And we're gonna do it in one, all-out fight...The        Sharks want a piece of this world too. And they're real down boys. They might        ask for blades, zip guns...I say this turf is small, but it's all we got,        huh? Now I want to hold it like we always held it, with skin. But if they        say blades, I say blades. If they say guns, I say guns. I say I want that        just to be the number one - to sail, to hold the sky...OK cats, we rumble.        Now, protocality calls for a war council between us and the Sharks, to set      the whole thing up. So I would personally give the bad news to Bernardo.\nRiff proposes getting help from Tony, a young Polish boy       and ex-leader of the Jets who has grown away from them and taken a respectable       job: \"We need      Tony.

The Oscars Library: The Books Behind Hollywood's Best Pictures\nAdvanced Search\nSHARE\nMore than two thirds of Hollywood's Best Picture winners were inspired by literature, whether it be a novel, biography, play, or short story. In fact, since the inaugural Academy Awards in 1928, more than 60 Best Picture winners derive from literature, and that's not including the nominees. From epic war stories to classic romantic comedies, here's a look at the lit behind Hollywood's most beloved films dating back to 1928.\n2010s\n2014: Birdman, or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\nThe movie itself was not based on a book but it is not without a literary connection.

(1961) New York, ... West Side Story (1961) - Rotten Tomatoes Super Reviewer\n½\nThe story is Romeo and Juliet set to music. The film's highlights are the music and songs that give resonance to Shakespeare's classic tale and the wonderfully arresting performance by Natalie Wood. What I don't like about the film is the choreography.  Set against the rough and tumble backdrop of New York City slums, these dancers are performing balletic and graceful moves the majesty of which belie the film's themes and social and economic realities.  In and of themselves, the dances are fun and enticing, but there is a true disconnect between them and the story. Here is a thought that is as yet only a germ in my brain: I find it odd that the white characters' complaints about their environment are social and economic -- big world issues -- whereas the Latinas embrace the social and economic realities of American life.  They feel honored to be here despite the racial realities with which they are faced.  It is as though the film, in a strain of racism, won't permit its minority characters any reasonable revolt.  As I said, I think I need to develop this thought more, but I'm still convinced there's something fishy about this film vis a vis race relations. Overall, it's fun and good, but it's certainly not perfect.\nJim Hunter\nSuper Reviewer\nIt's a little weird.  It's a classic, for sure, but the ballet-dancing, overacting, near-gangbangers are just a bit absurd.  Vivid and frenetic choreography and music (with a few oversyncopated atonal hot messes like \"Something's Coming\" and \"A Boy Like That/I Have a Love\"), but the Puerto Rican accents sometimes slip, and the \"brownface\" make-up is disturbingly noticeable, especially in Rita Moreno's case.  She, George Chakiris, and even Jose De Vega as Chino are fantastic, but I'm disappointed that the leads, Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood, had to be dubbed by what seemed like professional but deliberately handicapped singers.\nAlice Shen\nSuper Reviewer\n½\nIn 1962, the film version of the popular musical \"West Side Story\" won not one, not two, but ten academy awards.  The American Film Institute placed it second on it's list of the greatest film Musicals of all Time, right after \"Singin' In the Rain\" (and above The Wizard of Oz).  Obviously a film of this caliber doesn't need me or my praise, but I will share my opinion regardless.  The premise of the film (and I assume of the stage version) is simple: what if Romeo and Juliet took place in modern (1961) New York, and instead of rival families separating the two lovers, it was rival gangs?  The Jets vs. the Sharks, Americans vs. Puerto Ricans, white vs. hispanic, the barriers separating the two factions are distinct and seemingly uncrossable.  So Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer) find themselves falling in love at first sight when they meet at a dance, oblivious to the world around them.  I'm sure the film version has technical advantages over the stage version, and the \"first meeting\" scene is a perfect example of this.  It's a great piece of direction and artistry, undeniable artistry.  Whatever your feelings about singing, prancing gang members, it would be impossible to ignore the artistry of the film on display.  Add to this musical numbers that have entered into the cultural lexicon, and you have a near flawless film.\nDevon Bott\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\nWest Side Story (18-Oct-1961) Directors: ...

Great music and acting fantastic dancing. Story line is happy and sad. I think this is a classic. Natalie Wood was superb. She gave a real feel of the part when you watched her you believed that this was true and she was really Puerto Rican. All the actors and actresses where great and took the parts seriously enough that they put you in the middle of the scene, and you got lost in the story and the emotion. The dancing was wonderful giving just the right edge to this with the song writing as expressive and creative. When Bernardo dies and Riff dies you panic and when Tony tries to get the Jets to stop the fight you hope nothing will happen to get the Jets and Sharks into another fight. Of course you know that it will. Then when Maria finds Tony and Chico kills Tony your heart breaks and bleeds for Maria and the love they will never have. All they want is to get away from everyone and be married and have a happy life. I love this movie one of my all time favorites.\nHave you seen this film?

From 'Romeo + Juliet' To Macbeth: 11 Of The Best William Shakespeare Adaptations In Cinema History | Contactmusic.com\nFrom 'Romeo + Juliet' To Macbeth: 11 Of The...\nFrom 'Romeo + Juliet' To Macbeth: 11 Of The Best William Shakespeare Adaptations In Cinema History\nWilliam Shakespeare Ian McKellen Leonardo Dicaprio Michael Fassbender Kenneth Branagh\nHis work lives on 400 years after his death.\nTo commemorate the 400th anniversary of the death of the world's most renowned playwright William Shakespeare , we reflect on the best interpretations of his work that have ever hit the big screen. From all Kenneth Branagh 's flawless performances to Baz Luhrmann's brave modern adaptation, these are simply the best moments of Shakespeare in cinema.\n'Henry V' was Kenneth Branagh's directorial debut\n1. Henry V (1989): Kenneth Branagh's directorial debut and a career he never looked back from since, 'Henry V' was followed by 'Much Ado About Nothing', 'Hamlet' and 'Love's Labour's Lost'. Branagh has starred in every Shakespeare film he's directed apart from 'As You Like It', and directed every Shakespearean film he's ever starred in apart from 'Othello'. 'Henry V' won Best Costume Design at the Oscars, with nominations for Best Director and Actor.\nIan McKellen starred in a 30s set 'Richard III'\n2. Richard III (1995): Shot in black and white, Richard Loncraine ('Firewall') was at the helm for this, with star Ian McKellen helping him with the screenplay. Nominated for 2 Oscars and co-starring Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey Jr. and Maggie Smith, it's set in a 1930s fascist Britain as the House of Lancaster and the House of York come to blows over the future of the government.\nBaz Luhrmann had a unique take on 'Romeo And Juliet'\n3. Romeo + Juliet (1996): One of the better known cinematic adaptations is this gem from Baz Luhrmann ('Moulin Rouge!', 'The Great Gatsby') starring Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes. Nominated for Best Art Direction at the Oscars and winning three BAFTAs, this uniquely combined the classic Shakespearean language with a modern setting. Then you've got the musical re-telling set in New York City, 'West Side Story', which won no less than 10 Oscars after its release in 1961.\nKenneth Branagh's 'Hamlet' is among the myriad adaptations of the tragedy\n4. Hamlet (1996): Another Kenneth Branagh hit; this one starring Richard Attenborough, Billy Crystal and Judi Dench was nominated for 4 Oscars. Also worth a mention is Franco Zeffirell's twice-nominated 1990 flick with Mel Gibson and Glenn Close, and of course Laurence Olivier's 1948 classic which scooped no less than four Academy Awards.\nTrevor Nunn's 'Twelfth Night' had a particularly stand-out cast\n5. Twelfth Night (1996): Just one of the many interpretations of this play, 'Twelfth Night: Or What You Will' was directed by Trevor Nunn with an emsemble cast featuring Ben Kingsley, Helena Bonham Carter, Imelda Staunton and Toby Stephens. Set in the late 19th century, it was a film festival hit, winning the Silver Hugo award at Chicago International Film Festival.\n'A Midsummer Night's Dream' featured Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Christian Bale\n6. A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999): Another Shakespearean tale littered with stars, this 1999 flick featured Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci, Christian Bale and Dominic West among others. This Michael Hoffman ('One Fine Day') directed story was more of a cult hit though, with it's only award being the Golden Goblet at the Shanghai International Film Festival.\n10 Things I Hate About You is a modern re-telling of The Taming of the Shrew\n7. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999): A classic rom-com directed by Gil Junger and starring Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles. It's a re-telling of 'The Taming of the Shrew', for which a twice-Oscar nominated movie of the same name was also released in 1967 starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. \nAl Pacino was a hit in The Merchant of Venice\n8. The Merchant of Venice (2004): Nominated for a BAFTA award, this adaptation was directed by Michael Radford ('Nineteen Eighty-Four') and starred Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons and Joseph Fiennes. It is also dubbed as the first full-length sound film adaptation of the play that wasn't made for TV.\nThe Tempest featured a gender swap with Helen Mirren as Prospera\n9. The Tempest (2010): Despite a bizarrely mixed set of actors including Felicity Jones, Alan Cumming, Helen Mirren, Djimon Hounsou and Russell Brand, director Julie Taymor's adaptation of this comedy drama actually turned out quite well, especially with lead character Prospero being changed to a woman named Prospera. It was even given a nod at the Oscars for Best Achievement in Costume Design.\nCoriolanus was Ralph Fiennes directorial debut\n10. Coriolanus (2011): He might be an Oscar nominated actor but Ralph Fiennes is fairly new to directing. This Roman war tale was the first film he helmed and one on which he was joined by Gerard Butler. It was nominated for a BAFTA for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer, and went on to win 10 awards altogether. Despite the success, Fiennes has only directed one other title since, 2013's 'The Invisible Woman'.\nMichael Fassbender was the latest incarnation of Macbeth in The Scottish Play\n11. Macbeth (2015): The most recent of them all is Justin Kurzel's re-telling of 'The Scottish Play'.
