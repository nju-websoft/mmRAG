This is the fifth and final release within the series “Ships That Changed the World”.\nThe clipper Cutty Sark was built in 1869 at Dumbarton, Scotland.  The ship is named after a short chemise or undergarment called a sark. The famous Scottish Poet Robbie Burns created a character called Nannie Dee in his work ‘Tam o’ Shanter’ (1791). In the poem, Ms Dee wore a paisley linen sark that she had worn as a child and had outgrown, which explains why it was too short, or cutty. The vision of Ms Dee dancing in such a short undergarment caused the central character, Tam, to cry out, “Weel done, cutty-sark!” This became a popular catch-phrase of the time and thus the ship was named.\nThe most famous race of the Cutty Sark took place against Thermopylae in 1872. Both ships started together but Cutty Sark lost her rudder after passing through the Sunda Strait. The captain continued to race with an improvised rudder, yet she was beaten by only one week.\nIn 1890, she was taken out of the tea races and re-sized for general cargo transport. The Cutty Sark’s history of this period includes tales of tyranny, mutiny, murder, suicide and cholera. In later years, the ship recovered her reputation for speed by winning the wool race ten years out of ten (and beating Thermopylae every time they met). She posted Australia-to-Britain times of as little as 67 days, and in one instance, outsailed the fastest steamship of her age.\nIn the end, clippers lost out to steamships, which could pass through the recently opened Suez Canal and deliver goods more reliably. In 1916, she was dismasted off the Cape of Good Hope, sold, re-rigged and renamed Maria do Amparo. In 1922, she was restored to her original grandeur and used as a training ship in Greenhithe, Kent, England. In 1954, the Cutty Sark was moved to a custom-built dry-dock at Greenwich and was preserved as a museum ship as part of the National Historic Fleet, Core Collection. While undergoing conservation in 2007, the ship caught fire and was badly damaged, yet she is expected to be restored to her former glory.\nThe reverse design of the coin features a depiction of the Cutty Sark in full sail, against a colored background including a globe map. The inscriptions include “Cutty Sark” and “1 oz 999 Silver”. The obverse of the coin includes the Raphael Maklouf effigy of Queen Elizabeth II.\nEach coin is struck from one ounce of 99.9% pure silver in proof quality. There is a limited mintage of only 5,000 pieces worldwide. Each coin is housed in a presentation case with a customized shipper and numbered certificate of authenticity.\nPrevious issues of the series have featured the Santa Maria, Golden Hind, Mayflower , and the USS Constitution .\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nSeven of the most famous ships built on the River Clyde. ...

Picture: Wikicommons\nIt may have only been 45ft long, but the Comet represented a giant leap forward in shipbuilding technology when launched at Port Glasgow in 1812. The vessel provided the first commercially successful steamboat ferry service in Europe and hinted the era of sailing ships may be coming to an end. The Comet was built for Henry Bell , a Scottish engineer fascinated by the potential of steam power. When his wife became manager of a public baths and hotel in Helensburgh, Bell saw an opportunity to attract customers to the seaside town with a state-of-the-art ferry. The Comet was outclassed by other steamers within four years but had by then secured her footnote in maritime history. A replica of the boat now stands in Port Glasgow town centre.\nCutty Sark\nIt would take another 50 years before steam overtook wind as the power source of the biggest ships. The Cutty Sark was one of the last of its kind when launched in 1869 at the Scott & Linton yard in Dumbarton. Known as a clipper - a mid-19th century type of sailing ship built for speed - such vessels were characterised by a narrow hull and large total sail area. Cutty Sark was ordered by the shipping magnate John Willis and named after a character in Robert Burns’ classic poem Tam o’Shanter . Although famously associated with the Chinese tea trade, Cutty Sark spent most of her life at sea transporting wool from Australia. She last sailed in 1938 and became a cadet training ship. In 1954 the Cutty Sark was towed to a custom-built dry dock in Greenwich, south London, where she has remained ever since. The ship is a prominent landmark on the route of the annual London Marathon.\nRMS Lucania\nHMS Hood was built at the John Brown yard in Clydebank and launched in 1918. She was sunk in 1941 with the loss of 1415 crew. Picture: Wikimedia\nIn an era before air travel there was huge public interest in ships capable of reaching far-flung destinations at increasing speeds. The most prestigious route in British maritime trade was the Atlantic crossing to the US. Shipping companies promoted themselves on the speed and ease in which they could reach New York. The fastest passenger liner was awarded the Blue Riband, an unofficial accolade borrowed from horse racing. RMS Lucania, built at the Fairfields yard in Govan and launched in 1893, won the title on just her second ever voyage. At the time, Lucania and her sister ship Campania had the largest triple expansion engines ever fitted to Cunard liners.\nHMS Hood\nBuilt at John Brown’s yard in Clydebank and launched in 1918, HMS Hood was the pride of the Royal Navy and the most famous battleship in Britian upon the outbreak of war in 1939. Known as ‘The Mighty Hood’, the battlecruiser was employed to protect convoys in the North Sea and as a general deterrent against invasion. In 1941 the Hood was ordered to intercept the Bismarck - the largest battleship ever built by the German navy - and prevent her reaching the Atlantic where she would pose a threat to Allied shipping. On May 24 the Hood and HMS Prince of Wales spotted the Bismarck and opened fire. Less than 10 minutes later, a German shell struck the Hood and exploded her main ammunition magazine. The battleship sank within three minutes with the loss of all but three of her 1418 crew. It remains one of the blackest days in Royal Navy history and was a huge blow to British morale. The Bismarck was sunk two weeks later after being tracked by HMS Ark Royal . The wreck of the Hood was finally located in 2001 and one of her two ship’s bells was retrieved in 2015. It is planned to display the bell at a permanent memorial to the Hood and her crew.\nRMS Queen Mary\nRMS Queen Mary was built in Clydebank and is now permanently docked at Long Beach, California. Picture: Wikicommons\nThe Queen Mary, along with her sister ship Queen Elizabeth, were built for Cunard’s weekly express service between Southampton, Cherbourg, and New York. It was the dying days of the superliner era which would soon be ended by the growing popularity of transatlantic flights. Built at John Brown’s Clydebank yard and launched in 1934, the Queen Mary won the Blue Ribband in August 1936 for the fastest Atlantic crossing. She regained it in 1938 and would hold the title until 1952. The ship was named after Queen Mary, consort of King George V, and remained popular with passengers and the wider public into the 1960s. She was retired in 1967 and sailed to Long Beach, California, where she is now permanently moored as a floating hotel.\nQueen Elizabeth 2\nOcean liners were no longer built solely with transport in mind by the time of the Queen Mary’s retiral. Instead they were marketed as holiday destinations in their own right. The age of luxury cruises arrived at just the right time for the Queen Elizabeth 2 - or the QE2 as she quickly became known. She was the last superliner to be built at John Brown’s yard in Clydebank and many Scots can still recall her launch in September 1967. The interior and superstructure of the ship was designed by James Gardner - described by the Council of Industrial Design as that of a “very big yacht”. The QE2 would serve as the Cunard line’s flagship from 1969 until the launch of the French-built Queen Mary 2 in 2004. Although she spent much of her life as a crusie ship, the QE2 did undertake scheduled sailings from Southhampton to New York each year - a tradition continued by the Queen Mary 2. The liner was retired in 2008 and sold to an investment consortium. The QE2 is currently laid up at Port Rashid in the UAE, where her future remains unclear.\nHMS Daring\nHMS Daring docked in Leith in 2009. The ship was the first of the new Type 45 destroyers to be launched. Picture: Greg Macvean\nShipbuilding on the Clyde is today concentrated on three remaining yards and is dominated by Royal Navy orders. Defence giant BAE Systems operates sites at Govan and Scotstoun while a smaller commercial yard at Port Glasgow remains in private hands. The most prestigious shipbuilding programme on the river in recent years was the construction of six Type 45 destroyers. The first to be launched in 2006 was HMS Daring, the seventh naval ship to be given the name. Following the Falklands War, the Type 45s were primarily designed for anti-air warfare and are characterised by their distinctive radar towers. It has been suggested Daring’s radar is capable of tracking 1,000 objects the size of a cricket ball travelling at three times the speed of sound.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nTea Clipper Ships, British Tea, ... making this Scottish built tea clipper one of the fastest ships that ever moved under ...

History of the Cutty Sark. History of the Cutty Sark | HISTORY History of the Cutty Sark | HISTORY\nHistory of the Cutty Sark\nCutty Sark\nArticles\nHistory of the Cutty Sark\nThe Cutty Sark was once the most famous of the great clippers, the name ‘clipper’ referring to the fast sailing ships of the nineteenth century that traversed the world’s major trading routes. Commissioned by shipping magnate Jock ‘Whitehat’ Willis, she was built in a Scottish shipyard and launched at Dumbarton in 1869.  The Cutty Sark’s unusual name derived from a poem by Robert Burns called ‘Tam O’Shanter.’ In this ode, a hero is chased by some witches, with the fastest one’s revealing shirt being known by the Scots as a cutty sark. The Cutty Sark was a masterpiece, the pinnacle of sailing ship design. Her composite hull of timber and iron was sleek and strong, while her three masts could hold a spread of canvas that propelled the ship at up to 17 knots. As a result, she spent the 1870s speeding across the high seas, establishing a reputation as one of the fastest ships afloat.\nNot only did her speed translate into prestige, it also translated into profits: the Cutty Sark brought the new tea crop from China, which was incredibly fashionable amongst the tearooms and parlours of Victorian Britain. The first batch of the new tea harvest was highly coveted and thus the first tea cargo to arrive fetched the highest price. Indeed, the annual tea race was a Victorian sensation: the ships’ progress was reported by telegraph and could be followed in the papers. Huge bets were laid on the outcome. The Cutty Sark was never first to the finish line, but she was still one of the fastest. In 1872 she was involved in one of the most famous tea races of all time, against the Thermopylae. The two ships were neck and neck until the Cutty Sark lost her rudder in heavy seas in the Indian Ocean. The accident meant Thermopylae beat her back to London by 7 days, but the Cutty Sark’s performance was nevertheless remarkable.\nWhen the ship was launched, it was already the Indian summer of the great sailing ships. The Suez Canal, which had opened the very same year, offered steamships a shorter route to the Far East, slashing approximately two months off their journey time. The winds of the Red Sea and the Mediterranean were not suited to the clippers though. Consequently, the increasing speed and cargo capacity of steamships soon rendered sailing ships unprofitable. By the late 1870s, the Cutty Sark had been pushed out of the tea trade.\nThe Cutty Sark’s future looked bleak: in 1880, she set off on a voyage to Japan to deliver coal for the American Pacific fleet. It was a voyage she never completed. A fight amongst the crew left one man dead, and when the man responsible was allowed to escape by the captain, the rest of the crew mutinied. The ship’s captain, realising his career was ruined, committed suicide by stepping off the ship’s stern into the sea. These dark events gave the Cutty Sark a  new reputation amongst sailors, as a ‘hellship’ and a cursed vessel.\nThe ship’s owner, Jock Willis, was determined to turn her fortunes around and so, in 1885, he hired an excellent, albeit eccentric, clipper captain named Richard Woodget. Captain Woodget recognised that the Cutty Sark’s commercial edge now lay in the dangerous wool run to Australia. In this arena the Cutty Sark once again excelled, setting speed records between London and Melbourne and Sydney. For a decade she established her fame through her lightning voyages, but by 1895, she was approaching the end of her life expectancy and had ceased to be profitable.\nAfter her heyday, the Cutty Sark was sold to a Portuguese company, who renamed her the Ferreira. The ship spent 25 years transporting cargoes between Portugal, Africa and the Americas, and managed to avoid German U-boats during World War I. In the 1920s, she was purchased by Captain Dowman, a former clipper who remembered the Cutty Sark from her glory days. Dowman renamed her the Cutty Sark and brought her to Falmouth, where she was restored and opened to the public.\nUpon Dowman’s death in 1936, the ship passed to the navy Training College at Greenhithe to be used as a training ship by British naval cadets. Aboard her, a generation of Royal and Merchant Navy cadets were trained on how to work a sailing ship. Time finally ran out for the Cutty Sark after World War II, when the Training College got a new training ship.\nNow facing the scrapyard, the Cutty Sark was once again rescued from obscurity. In 1951, the Cutty Sark Society had been established by her admirers. With the support of the public and the Society’s patron, the Duke of Edinburgh, funds were raised to rescue her. In 1954, she was placed in dry dock in Greenwich, London. There she served as a unique example of breathtaking ship design and as a symbol of Britain’s proud maritime heritage. She also became the memorial to the Merchant Navy and its losses in two world wars.\nOver the decades, the same timbers that were once pounded by the storms of the Cape Horn came under new threat. Years of exposure to the elements took their toll. Her wooden hull was waterlogged and rotting and the iron frame that supports them was rusting. In 2007 comprehensive conservation of the ship was embarked upon.  The Cutty Sark is to reopen in 2011.\nLike on Facebook\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nCutty Sark.

Cutty Sark · National Historic Ships UK Cutty Sark · National Historic Ships UK\n963.00\nHistory\nBuilt in 1869 by Scott & Linton at Dumbarton, for the original owner John Willis, CUTTY SARK is the sole surviving extreme clipper, designed to be very fast. She was one of the last tea clippers built, but as this trade was taken over by the steamers using the Suez Canal, she turned to general trading including transporting wool from Australia. It was during this time that she made her legendary fast voyages. In 1895 she was sold to a Portuguese company and renamed FERRIERA. She was re-rigged as a barquentine following a dismasting in 1916. Captain Dowman of Falmouth decided she should be preserved and in 1922 bought the ship and made her part of a floating nautical school he was operating. In 1938, his widow presented the ship to the Thames Nautical Training School at Greenhithe. They maintained the ship until 1952 when the Cutty Sark Preservation Society was formed under the leadership of Frank Carr, Director of the National Maritime Museum, and the patronage of HRH the Duke of Edinburgh. The ship was permanently installed in a stone dry-dock at Greenwich on the Thames, and fully restored to her appearance as an active sailing vessel. In the 1990s, structural problems were first identified in her hull and plans were put in motion for a full restoration. She was awarded a grant of £13 million by the Heritage Lottery Fund and, in November 2006, her rig was dismantled prior to work commencing. On 21 May 2007, a fire broke out onboard CUTTY SARK in the early hours of the morning and was later put out by the London Fire Brigade. The Cutty Sark Conservation Project is a £25 million scheme, not only to preserve the fabric of the ship, but also to ensure that she has a sustainable future. The vessel will be lifted and suspended three metres above her current position, allowing her visitors to walk, dine or dance under her and, for the first time, be able to properly appreciate her beautiful lines. A sophisticated glass 'bubble' meeting the ship at the waterline will give year-round protection to visitors in the dry berth and to the lower hull itself. These new works will be clearly distinguishable so that each visitor knows what is historic and what is not. A new interpretation scheme will be installed to give a more atmospheric, more dramatic sense of life and times of the ship.\nThis vessel is a survivor from the First World War. You can read more about her wartime history by visiting our First World War: Britain's Surviving Vessels website www.ww1britainssurvivingvessels.org.uk . \nSignificance\n1.      What is the vessel’s ability to demonstrate history in her physical fabric?\nEvidence for designs, functions, techniques, processes, styles, customs and habits or uses and associations in relation to events and people.  How early, intact or rare these features are may impact on significance.\nCUTTY SARK has undergone numerous repairs during her lifetime, including conservation work in 1954-1957, and then, following a 1998 survey, a six-year project commencing in 2006. However, she retains the majority of her original wrought iron structure, which comprises 139 iron hull frames, deck beams, stringers, keel plate, box keelson, bilge keelson, side keelson, stanchions and the fore and aft collision bulkhead (openings have been made in the hull for access reasons) making her one of only two surviving composite vessels in the world.\n The iron hull frames have survived intact with only a small area of loss behind the aft bulkhead. Significantly the original markers stamp of ‘monkland’ and rating of the quality of the wrought iron as ‘Glasgow best’ (the poorest quality iron) are evident.  These frames have been preserved, using modern methods, in their current condition.  With 70% of fixing holes wasted below the bilge strake, and 90% of fixing above the bilge strake still usable, the hull planks under the bilge strake have been re-attached to ‘sister frames’ which consisted of new steels inserted in-between the original frames, attached from the bilge strake down to the keel plate. Where frame fixings had wasted away, the original muntz bolts (60:40 copper zinc ratio) fixings remained in the timber planks.  Approximately 87% of the vessel’s hull planks are original ‘as built’, being made of teak and rock elm.  Fractured planks have been repaired using like-for-like materials before being laminated and treated with epoxy resin.\nHer diagonal plates, fitted in pairs at an angle of 45 degrees from her bilge strake to sheer strake, have structurally deteriorated and have been over plated with new mild steel.  The original rivets had to be removed to fix the new steels, but most of the original material remains intact. Similarly, 19% of butt plates to which the hull plank ends are attached have completely corroded and been replaced. The bilge strake has been over plated its entire port and starboard length. The floors have corroded substantially and have been treated with new steel support angles. The keel was originally constructed in rock elm, but was replaced circa 1921, with longleaf pine. The fore and aft deadwoods, stern and stem post are all made from teak, with repairs carried out in the same material. The rudder has been lost numerous times over her life and is currently made from teak.\nThe majority of the iron panelling in the counter and all the rivets have been replaced due to structural failure. A large proportion of the iron bulwarks and flare have been replaced. The topgallant pin rail and wooden bulwark panelling has all been restored with teak, keeping examples of rope marks from her working life.  Almost all of the deck furniture, mooring bitts, mooring pipes fairleads, cleats, hawsepipe, cable compressors, eye plates, davits, the majority of the chain plates, deck and brace winches, bilge pump, bowsprit, steering gear, are from her working life. Her windlass, catsheads, heads, anchors, nameboards, billboard, gingerbread, sheathing and majority of her yards, jiboom, stuns’l booms and mast have been replaced since she has been in dry dock. All her concrete ballast has been removed.\nHer main cargo hatch still has her Lloyd’s number and tonnage marks. Damage to the ship’s decks after the fire of 2007 meant that the main deck, monkey fo’csle, and poop deck have been newly constructed using modern technology, with a teak laminate on a marine ply base. During the project the 1920s ‘tween deck was removed and replaced with a traditionally constructed deck made from Douglas fir. The forward and aft deck houses were reconstructed in the 1950s, with restoration of the Birdseye maple and teak panelling in the saloon. The Portuguese alterations to the accommodation were left in during the 1950s restoration for ease of visitor flow.  The ship has been re-rigged as a square rigged sailing ship, representing her days in the China tea trade. Her running rigging has been replaced with natural rope fibres.  A number of adaptations have been made to the hull and decks to facilitate access and interpretation in her role as a museum ship.\n2.      What are the vessel’s associational links for which there is no physical evidence?\nAssociations with people or places.  Off-ship research.\nCUTTY SARK is the sole surviving example of an extreme clipper of the late nineteenth century tea trade. She was built in 1869 on the Clyde in Dumbarton for ship owner Jock ‘white hat’ Willis and has connections to Scottish literary heritage, being named after a witch’s attire in Robert Burns poem ‘Tam O’Shanter’.  CUTTY SARK was designed by Hercules Linton and built by Scott & Linton - a relatively new firm, being only the sixth ship they had constructed.  \nCUTTY SARK was originally built for speed, bringing back the freshest tea from China, which helped to make the beverage popular in the British consciousness.  Tea clippers would race to be the first vessel back in London and CUTTY SARK is remembered for a race with her rival, the THERMOPYLAE, in 1872, which saw her lose her rudder off the Cape of Good Hope, arriving home a week later.  CUTTY SARK is also associated with the Australian wool trade and, under her famous master Captain Richard Woodget (Master 1885-1895), she had her most successful years setting a record passage of 73 days from Sydney to London. In 1889 she was spotted overhauling the P&O steamship BRITANNIA, noted in the BRITANNIA'S log simply as “sailing ship overhauled and passed us”! CUTTY SARK has clear international links, not only because of her history with the tea and wool trade, but also because of 25 years of operating under the Portuguese flag. In 1895, she was sold to the firm J. Ferreira & Co. and re-named FERREIRA, sailing to ports around the globe with a variety of cargoes, rigged, after 1916, as a barquentine.\nReturning to the UK in 1922, CUTTY SARK was restored to her appearance as a tea clipper, she was opened to the public in Falmouth and served as a sail training vessel. In 1938, she was transferred to the Incorporated Thames Nautical Training College at Greenhithe.  She participated in the festival of Britain in 1951, which year also marked the founding of the Cutty Sark Preservation Society by National Maritime Museum director Frank Carr, with HRH Duke of Edinburgh becoming patron (a role he remains active in). CUTTY SARK is now on permanent display, as a memorial to the men of the merchant navy who lost their lives in two world wars and is the only vessel in England to have been awarded Grade I listed status.\n3.      How does the vessel’s shape or form combine and contribute to her function?\nOverall aesthetic impact of the vessel, her lines, material she was built from and her setting.  Does she remain in her working environment?\nCUTTY SARK‘s lines were influenced by past designs, notably the ‘Tweed’, another ship in the Willis fleet. He instructed designer Hercules Linton to build ‘into the midship, attributes of Firth of Forth fishing boats, creating a beautiful new hull shape that was stronger, could take more sail and be driven harder than any other’.  She was designed in response to a need for fast ships to compete in the China tea trade and her 963 tonne hull, with its composite construction, gave her the necessary strength and speed to fulfil this demand. \nCUTTY SARK has a sharp bow with fine lines, a large sail area and a relatively small cargo carrying capacity.  She was built from high quality teak and rock elm attached to a wrought iron frame and her square rig carried 32,000 feet of canvas. Relative to her size, this was a greater sail area than that carried by any other clipper, achieving a top speed of 17.5 knots.  CUTTY SARK was built to carry cargo and, on her first voyage, she returned with 1.3 million pounds of tea in her lower hold and ’tween deck, accessed by three cargo hatches for loading.\nHer crew quarters originally consisted of senior officers in the Liverpool house, petty officers in the forward deck house, with bunks to accommodate 22 seamen in the foc’sle of the ship, with only one companion way for entry and exit.  However, this was altered in 1872, adding the aft deckhouse on the main deck for the petty officers and apprentices, with the ABs and OS’s moved into the forward deckhouse, offering easier access for the able seamen.\nAlthough no longer operational, CUTTY SARK has been displayed in an appropriate heritage setting since 1954, set in a purpose built dry berth in the world heritage site of maritime Greenwich, in the city she was registered in, with her bow overlooking the river she used to serve.  For 50 years, she was held in position by wooden and steel dock shores along her hull, but this caused the hull to sag. In addition, the degeneration of her iron framework put her in danger of collapse. During the 2006-2012 conservation project, a decision was taken to lift her 3.3 metres above her original position, supported by a triangular steel cradle, thus taking the stress off the original structure.  The ship was also enclosed below the waterline in a modernist glass structure protecting the lower hull from the elements.\nSource: NHS-UK team, 5 August 2015. \nThis statement was developed as part of the Heritage Lottery funded First World War project. http://www.ww1britainssurvivingvessels.org.uk/\nPrevious names\nKey dates\n1869 Built by Scott & Linton of Dumbarton for London ship owner John Willis\n1870-1877 Sailed mainly as a tea clipper, the first voyage took 98 days to Shanghai, returning with 1.3 million pounds of tea \n1872  In the first and only race with THERMOPYLAE from Shanghai CUTTY SARK was 400 miles ahead in the Indian Ocean when she lost her rudder and the race\n1877 Last tea cargo carried which ended the decade transporting jute from Manila to New York\n1880-1882 Carried Welsh coal for the American fleet in Japan.  First Mate killed a crew member and, in the ensuing mutiny, the Captain committed suicide  His replacement was an alcoholic and when cholera gripped the crew a second mutiny ensued due to\n1880-1883 Vessel used as a wool clipper and, in her first voyage, she made the passage from Newcastle NSW to London in 83 days beating her nearest rival by 25 days\n1885 Sold to Portuguese company and renamed FERREIRA  Carried general cargo between Lisbon and Brazil, East Africa and New Orleans\n1895 Sold to Portuguese company and renamed FERREIRA  Carried general cargo between Lisbon and Brazil, East Africa and New Orleans\n1916 Dismasted in a gale off theCapeand due to the difficulty of replacing large spars in wartime, she was re-rigged as a barquentine\n1921 Returned to London with a cargo of timber and word spread that she was for sale, but an offer was refused\n1922  Forced into Falmouth for repairs where Captain Wilfred Dowman, owner of the Falmouth training ship, spotted her  She returned to Lisbon and was sold to new owners who renamed her MARIO DO AMPORO, but later that year Captain Dowman bought he\n1922-1938  Falmouthtraining ship for boys entering the Royal Navy and Mercantile Marine\n1924 Restored to her former glory as a clipper\n1938 Presented to the Incorporated Nautical Training College TSS WORCESTER and berthed alongside WORCESTER as part of the college at Greenhithe\n1938-1953 Used as a Thames training ship\n1951 Moored at Greenwich for the Festival of Britain\n1953 Handed over to the Cutty Sark Preservation Society  Received on their behalf by the Duke of Edinburgh\n1954 Permanently installed in purpose built dock at Greenwich\n1954-1957 Restored to 1870 condition and opened to the public by HM the Queen in 1957\n1990 Structural problems were identified in her hull and plans were put in motion for a further full restoration\n2006 Having been awarded a grant of £13 million by the Heritage Lottery Fund, her rig was dismantled prior to work commencing\n2007 Fire broke out onboard and was put out by the London Fire Brigade\n2008 The Heritage Lottery Fund increased its award to the vessel by £10 million\n2012 April 25, Her Majesty The Queen, accompanied by His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh, officially re-opened CUTTY SARK to the public\nBibliography\n1941 Mariner's Mirror A Survey of the Cutty Sark in 1937\n1952 Sea Breezes Preservation of the Cutty Sark\n1954 Yachting World Cutty Sark - Last of the Clippers\n1966 Royal Institute of Naval Architects 1965, The Restoration of Cutty Sark\n1972 Ships Monthly Too much 'ship'\n1972 Ships Monthly Lines of the Cutty Sark: New Reconstruction\n1974 Mariner's Mirror Thermopylae v Cutty Sark - the 1872 official logs\n1978 Old Ships, Boats and Maritime Museums   - Sullivan, Dick\n1993 International Register of Historic Ships   - Brouwer, Norman J\n1993 Sea Breezes Condition of the Cutty Sark causes concern\n1997 Classic Boat Cutty Sark skills\n2003 Classic Boat Cutty Sark trust needs 8m to 'stay afloat'\n2004 Classic Boat Last Chance for Cutty Sark\n2010 Classic Boat CB report: chief executive replies\n2014 Cutty Sark: The Last of the Tea Clippers   - Kentley, Eric\nGrants\n1996-97 The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded £160,000 for restoration\n1996-97 The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded £96,432 for conservation plan\n1998-9 The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded £198,000 for removal and restoration of the Mizzen mast\n2004-5 The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded £50,000 for Phase One project planning\n2004-5 The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded £25,001,000 for the Conservation Project\n2007 A grant of  £40,000 was given towards a technical skills apprenticeship by The Headley Trust\n2008 HLF increased their award to the CUTTY SARK by £10 million.
