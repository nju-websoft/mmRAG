        "\nDOCUMENT 1:\n\nLana Lang is Clark Kent's high school sweetheart. She is one of the very few people who knows that Clark Kent is Superman. ... Lana Lang is in love with Clark Kent, ... Lana Lang (Character) - Comic Vine Lana Lang (Character) - Comic Vine\nDuring the events of Millennium , Lana was discovered to be a sleeper agent for The Manhunters .\nFirst Lady\nLana marries Pete Ross , and together the pair have a child who they name after Clark Kent. Ross runs alongside Lex Luthor in the latter's bid for the presidency. The pair succeeds, and when Luthor eventually falls from grace, Ross becomes President. Lana thus becomes First Lady. However, her relationship with Ross falls apart, and she begins to romantically pursue Clark Kent again, who resists her advances. She and Ross briefly reconcile.\nCEO of LexCorp\nCEO Lana Lang\nLana becomes the CEO of LexCorp . While in charge of the company, she presides over the sale of Kryptonite to the government in order to keep LexCorp in the black, as well as overseeing the implantation of a series of Kryptonite caches around the globe designed to defend against Superman going rogue. When confronted by Superman she detonates these Kryptonite caches, creating Kryptonite dirty bombs that fill the air with Kryptonite particles, forcing all Kryptonians to evacuate the planet. She later repents and attempts to aid Superman in a fight against Atlas , and is fired from LexCorp for her efforts, under a section of her contract that explicitly forbids aiding any Kryptonians using LexCorp resources.\nInsect Queen\nLana grows close to Supergirl , and takes a job at the Daily Planet as the editor for the business section of the paper. Supergirl adopts the identity of Linda Lang, Lana's niece, and the pair move into an apartment together in Metropolis. Lana begins experiencing unexplained health problems, collapsing twice. She goes to a hospital, but apparently dies while in the midst of an operation. However, she is actually becoming the host of the Insect Queen, who takes over the hospital and kidnaps Supergirl in the hopes of using the young woman to create a hybrid army. Supergirl escapes and frees Lana of her possession. The pair briefly have a falling out over Lana's concealing of her condition, but eventually reconcile.\nPowers and Abilities\nIn the current continuity, Lana was given powers from the energies given off by Superman as he died. She has the basic power of flight and super-strength, but also a more complex superpower. She can now turn radiation into other forms of energy. Originally, it was thought that she could only absorb solar radiation. However, it was revealed that she could absorb other types of radiation and convert it just as proficiently. Her default use of this ability is to convert the stored radiation into electricity that she uses for different purposes. Her mastery of electrical energies has reached the point where she can channel enough energy to power most of Metropolis.\nIn the past continuities, Lana Lang had no exceptional personal powers. She is intelligent and in good health and fitness for a woman her age. She occasionally gained super-human powers, usually during the Silver Age. All these transformations have been impermanent, and she has spent the majority of her life as a normal human.\nInsect Queen\nSilver Age\nLana Lang as the Insect Queen. Note her \"pump\" shoes in this version of her outfit. Later versions of her outfit replaced those with knee-high white boots.\nDuring the Silver Age, Lana became the Insect Queen after saving the life of an alien traveler who had been pinned under a tree. In gratitude, the alien gave her a device called a bio-genetic ring . The ring granted her the power to transform herself into an insect's or an arachnid's form, or grant her the features and/or attributes of one. However, she was unable to use any such form, or summon any such attributes, any more often than once every twenty-four hours.\nBronze Age\nLana Lang as the Insect Queen of Earth 2 in the Bronze Age.\nDuring the Bronze Age Lana once again became the Insect Queen, but she had different powers from those of her Silver Age version. Lana received a magical scarab from her father that possessed her and turned her into a villainess temporarily. The scarab granted her the ability to control insects and make them grow to massive sizes.\nAlternate Versions\nThe Dark Knight Returns\nIn the Dark Knight universe, Lana Lang is middle-aged, the managing editor of the Daily Planet, and an outspoken advocate for Batman .\nJLA: The Nail\nLana is a doctor who performs research on metahumans . She occasionally sneaks imprisoned metahumans out of the facility and hides them with the aid of the Kents.\nSuperman: Red Son\nLana Lazarenko grew up on a farm in the Ukraine alongside the man who would become Superman. They remain friendly in adulthood.\nOther Media\nAnimation\nThe New Adventures of Superman\nLana appears in a number of The Adventures of Superboy segments.

She leaves the relationship after the main universe's Lois helps Clark to accept and reveal his powers. She is played by Emily Procter.\nSmallville\nActress Kristen Kreuk as Lana Lang in Smallville\nLana is a major character in Smallville. She is Clark Kent's love interest through much of the series, though their relationship is very complicated. She is descended from a French witch who possesses her in the fourth season, and is frequently the target of so-called \"meteor freaks,\" people who have been mutated by their exposures to kryptonite. She spends about half of the series ignorant of Clark's secret.\nIn Season 8,, Lana Lang does re-appear, and receives the Prometheus nano-derm armor, which Lex intended to receive for himself.  She then manifests super-strength, durability and speed, as well as the ability to absorb various forms of energy. She and Clark enjoy the freedom of expressing affection for one another (without the worry of Lana getting harmed), and he even takes her on some of his patrols. On their last “op” together, Lana absorbs the kryptonite energy fueling an explosive device that Lex has built. Lana saves the city, but now, she can’t be within 10 feet of Clark. They share a heart-felt goodbye, and she departs at hypersonic speed. Lana does not make additional appearances on the show, but she is referenced by the code-name of Valkyrie, going up against rogue warlords in Africa.\nShe is played by actress Kristen Kreuk.\nVideo Games\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nThe Many Other Women Of...

Clark Kent KryptonSite Columns: The Many Other Women Of... Clark Kent\nThe                    Many Other Women Of... Clark Kent\nWritten                    by Russ Dimino\nJust                    a few years ago, many casual Superman fans probably assumed                    that Lois Lane was always the one and only love of Clark Kent's                    life. Then \"Smallville\" came around, and introduced                    Clark's high school sweetheart, Lana Lang, to a whole new generation                    of fans. But while Lois and Lana are the most well known love                    interests of the Man of Steel, they are certainly not the only                    ones. Throughout the years, there have been many women that                    Clark Kent has fallen for, and many who have fallen for him.                    In this column we will take a look at these other women, their                    appearances in the comics and on the big and small screens,                    and what each of them have meant to our hero.\nThough                    the comic books have had many ladies chasing after Superman                    from time to time, there are really only two that stand out                    as having been serious contenders for his heart. The first was                    Lori Lemaris (yes, another \"Double L\"). Introduced                    in Superman #129 in 1959, Lori was the woman Clark met and fell                    in love with while attending college at Metropolis University.                    The two were even engaged to be married, long before Clark ever                    met Lois Lane. One of the reasons it may not have worked out?                    The wheelchair-bound Lori turned out to be a mermaid. Yes, a                    mermaid. As the old saying goes, a bird could marry a fish,                    but where would they live? Inevitably, the engagement did not                    last.\nThe                    only other serious potential love interest for Superman in the                    comics has been another superhero, his fellow Justice League                    member, Wonder Woman. Ever since Superman planted a super kiss                    on Wonder Woman in Action Comics #600 (hey, he and Lois weren't                    together yet!), there has always been more than a hint of attraction                    between the two. Though these days they keep things on a purely                    professional level, many comic book \"Elseworlds\" tales                    (stories that take place in alternate worlds or in possible                    futures) often find Superman and Wonder Woman ending up together.                    Mark Waid and Alex Ross's \"Kingdom Come\" and Frank                    Miller's \"The Dark Knight Strikes Again\" both find                    Superman and Wonder Woman having a child together, long after                    Lois Lane has passed away. In Action Comics #761, Superman and                    Wonder Woman fight a war together in Valhalla that, to them,                    lasts a thousand years, though only a short time is passing                    on Earth. During this time, Wonder Woman offers to help take                    care of Superman's... er... physical needs... but he turns her                    down, knowing Lois will be waiting for him when he gets back.                    Now that's true love.\nIn                    the movies, \"Superman IV\" introduced Mariel Hemmingway                    as Lacy Warfield, daughter of the new Daily Planet's new owner,                    newspaper mogul David Warfield. Ironically, the wealthy and                    conceited Lacy was charmed by the clumsy and bumbling Clark                    Kent, though she found Superman to be rather boring! While \"Superman                    IV\" is not held in the highest regard by many fans of the                    film series, it does contain a fairly amusing scene where Clark                    has to play two roles at once, when he and Superman have to                    keep a double date with Lacy and Lois. Though Clark doesn't                    seem to have much in common with an upper class party girl like                    Lacy, a bit of his good nature rubs off on her, and helps to                    open her eyes to the people around her.\nBy                    the time the TV series \"Lois & Clark\" came around,                    it seemed that just as many women were becoming interested in                    the mild mannered reporter as were interested in the flyboy                    with the tights and cape. Cat Grant, the Daily Planet's gossip                    columnist, was asking who the new \"tight end\" was                    the moment Clark first set foot in the newsroom. Played by Tracy                    Scoggins all throughout the first season, Cat often toyed with                    Clark and teased Lois for not going after him. Cat even went                    so far as to tell an amnesiac Clark that they had once been                    lovers, after he lost his memory while destroying a meteor headed                    for earth. Unfortunately for the fans, Cat disappeared at the                    end of season one. Though Clark never fell for Cat's advances,                    he did seem occasionally amused by them.\nThe second season episode \"Church of Metropolis\" introduced                    Farrah Forke as Mayson Drake, a lawyer trying to shut down the                    organized crime ring known as Intergang. Again, providing a                    contrast with Lois, Mayson fell for Clark Kent, but did not                    think much of Superman. Clark did have feelings for Mayson,                    and the two went on a few dates, but Clark was torn by his duties                    as Superman as well as his undying love for Lois. In the shocking                    ending to the episode \"Lucky Leon,\" Mayson was killed                    by a car bomb, dying in Clark's arms. Catching a glimpse of                    the costume under his shirt as she died, Mayson finally understood                    why Clark could never really be hers.\nBy                    the time Lois and Clark finally got engaged on the show, the                    end of the third season brought about a slight complication.                    Zara, a survivor from the planet Krypton, arrived to reveal                    that she and Clark were actually promised to each other at birth,                    and they were, in the eyes of Kryptonian law, husband and wife.                    Played by Justine Bateman of \"Family Ties\" fame, Zara                    came to Earth with Lieutenant Ching to request Superman's help                    in fighting a war on New Krypton, a planet inhabited by survivors                    of the original Krypton's destruction. Superman and Zara shared                    a mutual respect for one another, but they were not in love.                    By the end of the story arc, they had their \"marriage\" annulled, and Zara and Lieutenant Ching had fallen for one another.\nWhen \"Smallville\" premiered in 2001, a brand new character                    was introduced to the Superman mythos in the form of Chloe Sullivan,                    played by Allison Mack. Often Clark's partner in crime-solving,                    Chloe has long had feelings for her farmboy friend. Even though                    Clark's eyes have almost always been on Lana, he and Chloe did                    share a romantic relationship for a time. Near the end of the                    first season, Pete Ross clued Clark in to the fact that their                    blonde reporter friend had a thing for him, and Clark asked                    Chloe to the spring formal. They almost shared a kiss at the                    dance, but they were interrupted by news of a twister heading                    towards Smallville. At the beginning of season two, Clark and                    Chloe agreed to remain \"just friends,\" though it's                    no secret that Chloe is still very much in love with him.\nThe second season episode \"Red\" introduced Red Kryptonite                    to the series, and also gave fans their first glimpse of \"Bad                    Clark,\" an uninhibited version of Clark Kent who lacks                    his normally strong moral judgment. In this episode, Clark has                    a fling with a girl named Jessie, played by Sara Downing. Bad                    Clark is attracted to Jessie's rebellious nature and take-no-crap                    attitude, and together they ride around on a motorcycle and                    dance at a bar in front of a frustrated Lana.\nLater                    that same season, Clark met a young Native American woman named                    Kyla when he discovered the caves beneath Smallville. Kyla,                    played by Tamara Feldman, believed that Clark was actually Naman,                    a legendary character whose coming was foretold by the writings                    on the cave walls. Clark, after being rejected by Lana for so                    long, found it refreshing to have a girl be interested in him                    for a change. \"It's a completely different feeling when                    the person likes you back,\" he explained to Lex. Unfortunately,                    Kyla turned out to be a Skinwalker, and turned herself into                    a wolf to attack developers who came onto her people's land.                    She died after being fatally injured while trying to attack                    Lionel Luthor. Clark still has a bracelet that belonged to Kyla,                    that is supposed to go to the one that Naman is destined to                    be with.\nIn                    the third season episode \"Obsession,\" Clark meets                    a girl named Alicia Baker, played by Sarah Carter. Like Clark,                    Alicia also has a secret; the meteor shower gave her the power                    to teleport. When they both are forced to reveal their powers                    in front of each other, they bond over the fact that they finally                    have someone to confide in. Alicia quickly falls for Clark,                    filling his locker with pictures of herself, and even teleporting                    into his bedroom at night for a makeout session. Clark, while                    attracted to Alicia and glad to have someone to share his secrets                    with, is a little freaked out by how fast she is moving, and                    also by her resentment of Lana. When Alicia snaps and tries                    to kill Lana, Clark's new love interest quickly becomes his                    new enemy.\nWith the premiere of the new episode \"Unsafe\" on Wednesday,                    January 26th, Alicia will return to \"Smallville,\" with Sarah Carter reprising the role. Exactly what twists and                    turns her relationship with Clark Kent will take this time around                    remain to be seen.\nIn                    the third season finale, \"Covenant,\" Adrianne Palicki                    played Kara, a supposed survivor of the planet Krypton who had come to bring Clark back to his father, Jor-El. That Kara's                    relationship with Clark was portrayed as a romantic one was                    a bit puzzling, if not disturbing to many fans, seeing as the                    character of Kara is best known to the comic book universe as                    Supergirl... Superman's cousin. We've heard of the term \"kissing                    cousins,\" but this may have taken it too far. Then again,                    it was revealed that this Kara was actually a girl named Lindsey,                    being used as a puppet by Jor-El, so we suppose it is forgivable.\nSo while Lois and Lana have certainly proven to be the mainstays                    in Superman's love life, there have been no shortage of other                    women who have either been attracted to the glasses or the cape.                    In each of these other women, perhaps, Clark may have seen a                    bit of the innocence of his hometown sweetheart Lana Lang, or                    the fiery independence of Lois Lane. In the end, of course,                    we all know that Clark ends up with Lois. Sometimes, though,                    it's the relationships that don't work out that teach us the                    most about ourselves, and what we're really looking for in that                    special someone. With Lois, Clark found someone who could love                    both the farmboy and the superhero.\nNote:                    The views of Russ Dimino don't necessarily represent the thoughts                    and feelings of everyone at KryptonSite.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\n... was the childhood sweetheart of Clark Kent, ... Lana Lang and Clark Kent dated while young ... Clark's high school and college years. Lana Lang is Clark's ... The religion of Lana Lang (Superman's childhood sweetheart) The religion of Lana Lang (Superman's childhood sweetheart)\nThe Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Character\nLana Lang\nSuperman's boyhood sweetheart\nLana Lang, who is at least nominally a Protestant Christian, was the childhood sweetheart of Clark Kent, the young man who would grow up to become Superman. Lana Lang was originally depicted as the girlfriend of young Clark Kent in the pages of Superboy.\nIn post-Crisis continuity, the history of Superman was re-designed such that he was never \"Superboy\" while growing up, and did not assume his costumed identity until adulthood. In this current continuity, Lana Lang and Clark Kent dated while young and Clark told her about his powers on the day he left Smallville to go to college and eventually become Superman. In the comics, Lana Lang remains a friend of Clark Kent and has never revealed his secret: that he is Superman. But Lana Lang suffers from some bitterness because Clark, the man she thought she would always be with, revealed his immense powers to her, but then left her. Clark is now married to his adult love interest, Lois Lane, naturally causing tension in his friendship with Lana.\nThe TV series Smallville focuses on Clark's high school and college years. Lana Lang is Clark's principle love interest in this series, and much of the ongoing drama of the series traces developments in their relationship.\nIn the comics and in the Smallville TV series, Lana Lang is depicted as a deeply moral, highly principled, honorable person. She is an inspiration to Clark, a young woman truly worthy of the attentions of Earth's greatest hero. The comics and Smallville TV series portray Lana Lang and her family as generic Protestants, although there are rarely any overt refrences to Lana's religious affiliation. Passing references in imagery and dialogue indicate Lana Lang has some belief or upbringing in concepts such as God, Judeo-Christian ethics, and the afterlife. Lana's family celebrates Christmas and wedding scenes featuring Lana depict generic Protestant-style weddings. Many depictions of Smallville show a Protestant church with a cross as a major feature in the town's landscape.\nLike most comic book characters created in the era that her character emerged from, the taboo against overt depictions of religious content meant that Lana's precise denominational affiliation was not revealed. Lana Lang's ethics and religiosity were primarily revealed through her behavior and not through direct identification.\nOne novel innovation in the Smallville series is that Lana Lang is the descendant of a family of witches and evil magic users in medieval France. In the Smallville series, later seasons portray Lana Lang studying books about her magical heritage. In some episodes, Lana Lang becomes is by the spirit of her witch ancestor. Despite these developments, Lana should not be considered a witch in any conventional sense, nor should she be identified as a Wiccan.\nLana's interest in magic may have begun in early childhood. The pilot episode of Smallville introduces Lana Lang at the age of 3, dressed as a \"fairy princess.\" The young Lana uses a plastic \"magic wand\" to grant Martha Kent a wish. Martha wishes for a child, and finds her wish is soon granted, as only minutes later, she and her husband find the infant Kal-El walking away from his crashed spacecraft. Martha and her husband of course adopt the infant and raise him as their son, Clark Kent. Certainly the show's creators are not trying to say that Lana Lang's magical powers actually were responsible for bringing Clark to Smallville, but these scenes do elegantly serve to tie the lives of Lana and Clark to each other, even from an early age.\nThe wish that Clark Kent's mother made through Lana Lang's the \"fairy princess\" was recalled much later, in Episode 1 of Season 1 of Smallville. When Lana Lang and Martha Kent find themselves spending a quiet moment together after a hurricane, Martha tells Lana about how the wish she granted came true: Martha Kent explains that right after Lana granted her a wish the meteor shower began. Right after the meteor shower (which of course was a tragic event for Lana), Clark Kent came into the lives of Martha and her husband. Martha tells Lana that the wish she granted came true, and she is grateful for that. Martha does not seriously believe that Lana had magical powers, but nevertheless, Martha never forgot this wish that came true.\nScenes from Smallville, Season 1, Episode 1 - the pilot episode\n[Timestamp: 1 minute, 37 seconds. Martha and Jonathan Kent are in a flower shop in downtown Smallville. The shop is owned by Lana Lang's aunt, Nell, who is at the counter ringing up a purchase for the Kents. Martha Kent sees a young girl who looks like she is about three years old. The girl is wearing a play costume that consists of a mostly-white dress, a plastic faux-jeweled tiara, and fairy wings. The girl is holding a plastic \"magic wand.\" The girl is sitting at a small table. Martha Kent recognizes that this girl is Lana Lang. Martha approaches Lana and crouches down to be at eye level with the girl.]\nMartha Kent: That is a beautiful dress, Lana. Are you a princess?\nLana Lang (as child): I'm a fairy princess.\nJonathan Kent: Hey, where are her parents?\nNell (Lana's aunt): Oh, they're at the homecoming game, with everyone else. I'm being the good aunt.\nLana Lang (as child): [Addressing Martha Kent.] Do you want to make a wish?\nMartha Kent: [Smiling and playing along.] I would love to make a wish.\nLana Lang (as child): Okay. Abracadabra.\n[Lana moves her \"magic wand\" in a circular motion over Martha Kent's head. A musical cue indicates something \"magical\" has happened.]\n[The scene shifts to outside the shop, to the where the Kents parked their red pickup truck. Jonathan Kent carries his purchases and puts them in the back of the truck. Martha Kent is already sitting in the passenger seat in the cab of the pickup truck. She looks wistful. Jonathan gets in the driver's seat. He sees the look on his wife's face.]\nJonathan Kent: I know what you wished for.\nMartha Kent: I see a little face. It's all I ever wanted.\n[Jonathan kisses his wife. Seconds later we see the tiny spacecraft that carries the infant Kal-El (Clark Kent) hurtling to Earth. It is almost as if Lana Lang's magic has indeed granted Martha Kent's wish. But at what price? Kal-El's spaceship is accompanied by a meteor storm of Kryptonite rocks - fragments of Kal-El/Clark Kent's homeplanet Krypton. Citizens of Smallville in the town's downtown area see the smoke trail left by the crashing spacecraft. Lana Lang's aunt Nell sees the people looking up at the sky. She walks out to the street, carrying Lana in her arms. She looks up a the sky and sees the smoke trail, along with approaching meteors.]\nNell (Lana Lang's aunt): What on God's earth...?\n[Timestamp: 4 minutes, 30 seconds. From Nell and Lana looking up at the sky, the camera shifts to show a young couple getting out of a car. The back window is decorated with a balloon, a pom-pom, and  a banner that reads, \"Let's Go Smallville\". These are Lana Lang's parents, returning from the homecoming game to pick up their daughter.]\nLana Lang's mother: [Shouting from across the street.] Hi, Lana.\nLana Lang: Mommy! Daddy!\n[A sonic boom is heard. Lana Lang's parents begin walking from their car to where Nell is holding Lana. But they stop and look up at the sky. A meteor, appearing as a fireball, hurtles downward. The meteor hits their car and the impact causes a massive explosion that engulfs them, killing them instantly. Debris flies at Lana Lang and her aunt, who fall to the ground, but they are unhurt. Lana's parents are dead, killed by the very meteor shower that brought Lana's future love interest Clark Kent to Earth. Other meteors continue to pummel Smallville. We see Nell holding a crying, terrified Lana in her arms. It will later be revealed that this very image was captured by a photographer and used as a cover for Time Magazine. Timestamp: 5 minutes, 27 seconds.]\n* * * * *\n[Timestamp: 28 minutes, 22 seconds. In the previous scene, Jonathan Kent told his adopted son Clark Kent about how clark really came to be in their family. Jonathan showed Clark, who is now sixteen years old, a metal object with Krytonian writing on it, and then showed him the spaceship that brought Clark to Earth. The ship had been stored by Jonathan in a storage cellar all these years, and he had never before shown it to Clark. Clark is upset that his adoptive parents had withheld this information for so long. He storms off. It is night time. We now see Smallville cemetary. Lana Lang rides a horses into the cemetary. She dismounts. She is carrying a small bouquet of flowers. Her horse is spooked and makes a sound that indicates its surprise. Lana notices, and realizes somebody else is present.]\nLana Lang (not a teenager): Who's there?\nClark Kent (also a teenager): It's me. Clark.\nClark takes a step closer to where Lana is standing. He thus positions himself in front of a large, life-size statue of an angel, an ornate grave marker. The scene is purposefully framed so that Clark now appears to have wings. Clark is in front of the head and body of the angel statue, but the angel statue's wings appear to Clark's wings. The symbolism is clear: Clark is an angel. Or at least, for this scene, Clark will be as an angel to Lana.]\nLana Lang: Clark Kent? What are you doing creeping around the woods?\nClark Kent: You'd never believe me if I told you. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.\nLana Lang: Clark, wait. Just wasn't expecting to see anyone out here. Are you okay?\nClark Kent: I'm hanging out in a graveyard. Does that strike you as okay behavior?\nLana Lang: Hey, I'm here too.\nClark Kent: Good point. What's your story?\nLana Lang: Can you keep a secret?\nClark Kent: I'm the Fort Knox of secrets.\nLana Lang: I... came out here to talk with my parents. You must think I'm pretty weird, you know, conversing with dead people.\nClark Kent: No, I-- I don't think you're weird, Lana. Do you remember them.\nLana Lang: They died when I was three.\nClark Kent: I'm sorry.\nLana Lang: It's not your fault, Clark. Come on, I'll introduce you. [Lana leads Clark by the hand, walking him over to her the headstone that marks the graves of her parents.] Mom, Dad. This is Clark Kent. Say hi.\nClark Kent: Hi.\nLana Lang: [Lana speaks directly to the headstone, pausing occasionally as if listening to her parents reply to her side of the conversation.] Yeah, he is kind of shy. [Pause.] How should I know? Mom wants to know if you're upset about a girl.\nClark Kent: [Clark shakes his head no.]\nLana Lang: Dad wants to know if you're upset about a guy.\nClark Kent: No, no.\nLana Lang: [Laughs at Clark's discomfort at that question.] He has a twisted sense of humor. Seriously, Clark. Why are you out here?\nClark Kent: Lana, you ever feel like your life was supposed to be something different?\nLana Lang: [Nods yes.] Sometimes I dream I'm at school, waiting for Nell to pick me up. But she doesn't come. So, my parents drive up and they're not dead, they're just really late. And I get in their car and we drive to my real life in Metropolis. That's usuallly when I wake up. And for a minute, I'm totally happy. Until I realize I'm still alone.\n[Clark looks at Lana. He looks at the headstone. The top line reads \"LANG\". Beneath that are the names of Lana's parents, \"LEWIS: 1957-1989\" and \"LAURA: 1959-1989\". Below that the enscription reads, \"Forever loved\".]\nClark Kent: [Clark begins speaking to the headstone, as Lana had done.] What's that, Mrs. Lang? [Pause.] Yeah, I'll tell her. [Looks up at Lana.] Your mom wants you to know that you're never alone. That she's always looking over you. No matter what. [Pause.] What's that, Mr. Lang? [Pause.] Your dad thinks you're a shoe-in for homecoming queen.\nLana Lang: They really say all that?\nClark Kent: Oh, yeah. They're quite chatty once you get them started.\n[End of scene.

Lana Lang was a childhood friend and the high school sweetheart of Clark Kent; ... Lana Lang - DC Animated Universe - Wikia Lana Lang | DC Animated Universe | Fandom powered by Wikia\nHistory\nClark confiding in Lana of the sudden changes in his life.\nLana Lang was one of the oldest friends Superman had in Smallville . Like Clark's Earth parents Martha and Jonathan Kent , Lana was with Clark from the beginning: She saw his transformation from country boy to superhero happen first hand. She was the first person Clark went to when his latent powers began to surface. She saw first hand his X-Ray vision, and witnessed his acute hearing. As Clark dashed (to use a relative term) to the scene of an accident, Lana saw not only his super speed, but his strength and invulnerability. [1]\nHowever, in Lana's eyes, something more existed than just friendship. An attractive girl, she was always able to garner the attention of any man she was interested in, except Clark Kent. He had always considered her a good friend, and though the two did date for a time, the relationship didn't last. While she vocally expressed her continued level of interest in Clark, the two never permanently clicked; regardless, they remained close throughout high school.\nLana went on to become a fashion designer, and achieved international fame with her fashion house, Lana Lang Fashions (or LL for short), with one building in Metropolis and at least offices in Paris and Gotham City . [2] She was known as a jetsetter; keeping residences in several cities. Her celebrity status, combined with her indisputable physical beauty, caught the attention of Lex Luthor , who, in classic Luthor fashion, sought out and began a relationship with her immediately. Unlike many of his dealings, their relationship was genuine; Luthor actually expressed gratitude to Superman when he saved Lana from an attempted murder.\nDespite being a famous designer, she kept an eye on Clark's whereabouts over the years and correctly deduced he was Superman when both of them appeared in Metropolis at the same time.\nHowever, like any other relationship, things change. Lana learned of Luthor's less-than-admirable qualities, and began informing Superman of his behind the scenes activities despite his objections to the danger she was putting herself in. Unbeknownst to Lana, Mercy Graves had been observing her for some time, and informed Luthor of the relationship Lana and Superman appeared to share. Though he initially doubted Mercy's findings, his opinion changed as he saw Lana kiss Superman after revealing her feelings for him.\nEver quick to anger, Luthor quickly arranged for Lana to be assassinated. Lana, thinking she was again aiding Superman, fell victim to Luthor's ploy and had sent Superman to Central City to stop another arms deal. Alone and trapped within a lead refinery, Lana was drawing her final curtain. Fortunately, Superman intervened. Never having left for Central City, he instead trailed Lana and aided her escape (twice, incidentally). [3]\nClark and Lana always looking out for each other.\nLana left for a show in Paris. She briefly returned to Metropolis to help Superman explain away the apparent murder of Clark Kent by providing him with a cover story and alibi that she had picked up and cared for an injured Clark Kent after he escaped a murder attempt. She promptly contacted Lois Lane , who was shocked to find Clark alive and equally angry at the relationship the two seemed to share. [4]\nLana returned to Metropolis once more for another fashion show that focused on her company's new line of swimwear. At this event, her star model Darci Mason headlined the lineup. Events became complicated however when Darci was revealed to be not only a robot, but a creation of the Toyman . Lana discovered Darci's origins when Lana surprised Darci trying to repair her damaged face with a blowtorch in the workshop at Lana's fashion house. [5]\nLana attended Superman's funeral after his presumed death at the hands of the Toyman, sitting with the Kent family.

As they watch the show, Lex Luthor shows up along with his newest date: Lana Lang . Clark is quite interested in the fact as he used to date Lana back in high school. While Lana leaves to work on her fashion show, Luthor meets up with an employee, Mr. Eelan , who speaks of some mysterious customers.\nLana finishes dressing up one of her girls and is soon confronted by two women who kidnap her to get her expensive dress. Clark walks in the room just after Lana's been taken. The kidnappers throw Lana into an elevator and are soon confronted by Superman. They toss Lana out of the elevator to distract Superman and attempt to escape. However, Superman manages to both save Lana and capture the criminals. After her rescue, Lana lets on that she knows that Superman is really Clark Kent. Luthor shows up after Superman leaves and expresses his happiness that showed up.\nSuperman and Lana catch up.\nLater at Lana's apartment, Superman talks to Lana and asks how she was able to figure out his identity. Lana confesses that it was obvious as she saw him do those amazing skills back when they were in high school and noticed that both Superman and Clark Kent had arrived in Metropolis around the same time and easily made the connection. Superman then changes the subject and warns her about Luthor. He mentions that the man Luthor spoke to was an arms dealer and that he may be selling weapons for Luthor. Lana is unconcerned and assures him that she can handle Luthor. Superman then starts to leave, but again warns Lana to be careful. As he fies off away from Lana's apartment, he is seen by Mercy Graves .\nSuperman saves a train from falling.\nMercy reports what she saw to Luthor, but Lana manages to dissuade him from punishing her. Luthor speaks to his arms dealer, but Lana listens in on him. Mercy observes this and offers to kill Lana, but Luthor refuses. Outside, Lana calls up Clark and tells him about the arms deal.\nOutside Metropolis, the arms dealer shows his customers a weapon that shoots a microwave beam and causes objects to overload their electrons and explode. Superman shows up and confronts them but only manages to capture the criminals. The arms dealer destroys a rail bridge and escapes while Superman saves the train.\nLana kisses a surprised Superman.\nLater that night in Metropolis park, Superman and Lana talk where Lana continues to insist that she becomes Superman's sidekick but he continues to refuse her. Lana then confesses that she still has feelings for him and asks to let her prove that they can be a great team. However, before Superman can further protest, Lana kisses him and they both share a moment. However, unbeknownst to either of them, Luthor is watching from afar and angrily leaves.\nThe next day, Lana has lunch with Luthor and overhears him talking to Eelan over the phone about another arms deal in Central City . Lana calls it in to Superman and still refuses to listen to his warnings. There's a knock at Lana's door and she enters into a limo only to find Eelan is driving.\nLana wakes up in a lead factory and is told that the because of the lead fumes the place is automated and Superman can't see them. She is placed in a mold for lead bars and is nearly covered in molten lead. However, Superman shows up anyway, revealing that he suspected Central City to be a ploy. Eelan attempts to stop Superman with his weapon and causes molten lead to fill the factory. Both Lana and Eelan are almost killed but Superman manages to save them both.\nClark and Lana say their goodbyes.\nA few days later, Clark is reading the paper at the Daily Planet where Luthor is being investigated over the weapons he tried to sell. Lana then appears to him and informs him that she is heading off to Paris to continue her job while also informing him that she has learned her lesson after her ordeal. Clark reveals that he does indeed care about her even saying she is like a sister to him. Lana thanks Clark and tells him that he will find that special someone someday, however they are soon interrupted when Lois calls out to Clark informing him of a new assignment. Lana takes her leave and Clark heads to Lois.\nCast\nSuperman: The Complete Animated Series (DVD)\nProduction inconsistencies\nSuperman grabs Lana while still covered in molten lead, yet Lana does not suffer any burns and the lead is gone by the time he grabs Eelan.\nTrivia\nIn one scene Superman risks his life to save a deer. This is the first time he's been shown to take such a risk for a creature other than a human.\nAfter Superman rescues Lana at the fashion show, she utters the phrase \"Thanks to Superman\", a phrase used at the end of most of the Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios Superman animated shorts.\nQuotes\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nSmallville High School, or Smallville High, ...

So, as a token of my apprictiation of them, they're gonna be in this story about how Sarah Marie Kent went through life having a brother from another planet...Yeah. Some of you may have noticed that the name Sarah always appears in my stories. But, hey, a girl can dream right? Anyway, enjoy!)\nA warm, bright, and sunny morning shone through 12 year old Sarah's window, as it casted a mixture of golden-yellow on her sleeping form. Her brown hair covered her sleepy eyes, and the covers of her bed hardly covered her legs.\n\"Sarah Marie Kent! Get out of bed! You'll be late!\" shouted the voice of Martha Kent, her mother\nSarah groaned as she heard the cry of her mother. Slowly opening her light blue eyes she looked at the clock. 6:30. She only had 30 minutes to get ready for school. Usually she woke up around six, which allowed her to take a shower, get dressed, and eat a good breakfast. Right now to her, it looked like she'd be skipping breakfast. She dragged herself out of bed, putting on her red robe and going to the bathroom door. She turned the knob, but realized it was only a short turn. It took her moments to realize that it was her brother, Clark Kent, in there and she let out and exasperated sigh.\n\"Clark! Get the heck out of the bathroom! I do not want to be late!\" she yelled through the door\nSarah put her head against the door as she waited for Clark to come out. For as long as she could remember, there was something about Clark that she didn't like. That was why she always raised her voice at him when he did something to annoy her. Clark did the same thing. Their parents tried everything to make them get along but soon realized that someday the would get along without their help.\nClark came out of the bathroom with wet hair, and his clothes on. He had a smirk on his face.\n\"Don't tell me you used the hot water,\" Sarah said. \"That's like pure gold out here on the Kent farm,\"\n\"Hope you're feeling hot, cause you're gonna get all the cool water you can get,\" Clark said walking to his room\n\"I'm gonna get you, Clark Kent!\"\nAnd with that, Sarah slammed the bathroom door, and locked it. She threw off her bathrobe and turned on the water for the shower. She drew her hand to the water, and drew it back quickly. The water was ice cold. She groaned. Oh yes. She was going to get her brother for this.\nA few minutes later, Sarah was walking downstairs to the kitchen. She was wearing a red shirt with a blue jean trench coat, jeans, and her white tennis shoes. Her wet brown hair was tied up in a relaxed pontytail, a strand of hair running down the side of her face.\n\"Morning sleepyhead,\" said Mr. Kent as she came in the kitchen\n\"Morning dad,\" said Sarah as she sat down across the table\n\"Ready for another day of Jr. High?\" asked Mrs. Kent\n\"After weeks of it, I think I'm ready,\"\n\"Well eat an apple, and get a quick glass of milk. I don't have time to make you breakfast,\"\nSarah nodded and got up to the fridge, but when she opened the door to grab the milk, another hand grabbed it. She looked up to see Clark smiling as he drank out of the bottle. This time it was her turn to smirk.\n\"Mom!\" she yelled. \"Clark's drinking out of the bottle!\"\nMrs.Kent walked forward to Clark and grabbed the milk bottle from Clark's hands.\n\"It tastes better out of the bottle,\" he complained.\n\"Where'd you learn your manners?\" asked Mrs. Kent\n\"On a farm,\"\n\"Is that why you always hog the hot water?\" asked Sarah\n\"That's enough out of you, young lady,\" warned Mr. Kent\n\"Well it's true,\"\n\"Well next time, you can get up earlier than usual. That way you can get all the hot water you need. But right now, you need to catch the bus, or you'll be late.\"\nSarah sighed as she grabbed her blue messenger bag, and headed for the door.\n\"Sarah!\" shouted Clark. \"Think fast!\"\nSarah turned around just in time to see an apple heading her way. She caught it just in time.\n\"What was that for?\" she asked glaring at her brother\n\"Just getting you ready for next year's Smallville softball team,\" grinned Clark\nSarah rolled her eyes, and ran down the road as the bus came up to her family farm. The doors opened, and she climbed up the steps, searching for a place to sit.\n\"Sarah!\" shouted a voice. \"Over here!\"\nSarah looked up, and smiled. There was Chloe Sullivan waving her hands, gesturing for her to come sit with her and Pete Ross. Chloe and Pete were Clark's friends, and hers. Quickly she walked over to sit across from them.\n\"Where's Clark?\" asked Pete\n\"Don't know. And I don't care,\" griped Sarah\n\"Another one of your sibling rivalries?\" asked Chloe teasing. \"What happened this time?\"\n\"He hogged the hot water, he drank my milk, and he nearly took off my head with my own breakfast. That's what,\"\nPete chuckled as he looked out the window. He saw Clark running from the house as the bus pulled away. Chloe sighed and held up a 5 dollar bill between her fingers.\n\"I can't believe you bet against your best friend,\" she said shaking her head.\n\"Statistical fact,\" said Pete. \"If Clark moved any slower, he'd be extinct,\"\nSarah laughed at Pete's joke as the bus stopped again, and more people came in. She looked up and saw her friends Brianna Arkin and Allison Harper.\n\"Hey guys!\" she shouted.\nBrianna and Allison walked up and sat by their friend.\n\"Where's your brother?\" asked Allison\n\"Missed the bus again,\" mummbled Sarah in her \"I don't care\" tone\n\"Uh-Oh,\" said Allison and Brianna in unison.\n\"Sibling Rivalry?\" asked Brianna.\n\"Yep.\" answered Sarah.\n\"Your brother and my brother should switch. At least your brother talks to you. Mine just mopes around with his bug collection,\"\n\"You want him? You can have him,\"\n\"Greg? Your brother?\" Allison asked Brianna. \"I thought he was at military school,\"\n\"Ugh. My mom says that, but she doesn't mean it. She hasn't gone over it with my dad though, even though they're divorced,\" said Brianna. \"But whatever happens he'll know what the reasons are,\"\nThe bus stopped in front of the schools. Sarah, Brianna, and Allison's Jr High Schol (Smallville Jr. High) was right across from Clark, Chloe, and Pete's school (Smallville High). Which was really bad for Sarah because, since she started Jr.High, Mrs. Kent wanted Clark to pick her up from school and take the bus from there. They walked up the steps and went inside. Practically everyone was inside and it took them everything they could to get to their lockers. When Sarah opened her locker, a balloon fell out and crashed on the floor. Yellow paint splattered on her clothes and her face. Everyone around her laughed. Allison looked at her face and pointed at her clothes.\n\"That's a good color on you,\" she joked.\n\"Ali!\" shouted Brianna\n\"Come on. Let's go to the gym and ask the coach for some P.E. shirt,\"\n\"Excuse me,\" Sarah stopped Brianna. \"I'm not gonna go around wearing an old P.E uniform,\"\n\"Would you rather walk around with paint on your shirt?\" asked Allison.\nA few minutes later, Sarah sat in class listening to her language teacher teach them about America's first authors and poets. This is the worst day ever! she thought to herself. Suddenly she felt something hit her head. She looked back and saw a short brown haired boy, with freckles that ran across his face and over his nose. He had an evil looking grin on his face. She turned around ignoring him. This was the worst day ever.\nAfter a hard day at school, Sarah stood outside the school with Brianna and Allison sitting on the steps\n\"Why are we here again?\" asked Allison\n\"We're waiting for Clark to get Sarah, so we can go with her to study for the stupid Geography test for next friday,\" said Brianna.\n\"Well it looks like we're gonna miss the bus,\"\n\"Why?\" asked Sarah\n\"Smallville High is having football tryouts today,\"\n\"What does that have to do with Clark,\"\n\"Well lets see. Your grandfather played football, your dad played football, what do you think Clark's gonna do?...By the way Bri. Is your brother playing?\"\n\"I told you!\" Brianna said. \"I don't care what my buggy brother does as long as the creep stays away from me,\"\nSarah, not wanting to listen, ran across the street to the High School. Brianna and Allison followed her, running behind her. Sarah stopped on the edge of the field. There were freshmen in red and yellow football uniforms, making passes, hitting tackle dummies, and doing agilities. Her eyes gazed toward Clark, who was sitting on the stands. She shook her head.\n\"Let's go home guys,\" she said.\n\"Are you going on the bus?\" asked Brianna\n\"No, I'll walk,\"\n\"OK. See ya later!\"\n\"Bye,\"\nSarah watched Allison and Brianna go to the bus that was waiting for them. She started walking away from the field, and onto the side of the street. She walked for about two miles, when she saw a speeding car drive past her. It was a black Porsche. She curiously looked at it as it drove away, and looked up towards the bridge. She groaned. There was Clark again, overlooking the river.\n\"That kid is everywhere!\" she said to herself. \"Why can't something bad happen to him?\"\nSuddenly, as if her words were magic, the black Porsche started swerving. Clark looked behind him, and before he knew it, the car crashed into him, and they bother fell off the bridge and into the river.\n\"CLARK!\" shouted Sarah, involuntarily\nWithout realizing what she was doing, Sarah ran to the edge of the bridge, to search for Clark. The car the crashed into him was sinking. She threw off her messenger bag, and her blue jean trench coat, and jumped into the freezing cold water. Underwater, she saw someone swimming into the car. It was Clark, trying to get the driver out of there. She didn't understand. He was hit by a car, and still alive? That could've killed him. She watched as Clark pulled out an unconsious bald man out of the Porsche and swim up to the surface. Sarah followed him, and gasped for air as she came out of the water. She swam as Clark gave the man CPR.\n\"Clark! Wait up!\" she shouted as she came out, water dripping from her clothes.\nClark looked behind him, and was shocked\n\"Where'd you come from?\" he asked\n\"I fell in, and saw what you were doing,\" she explained.\nClark ignored Sarah's response, and continued giving the man CPR. He woke up coughing. He looked up and saw Clark\n\"I could've sworn I hit you,\" he whispered\n\"If you did, I'd be...I'd be dead,\" Clark said.\nAn hour later, Sarah sat beside Clark with a red blanket over her shoulders. Police were swarming over the place, and they were bringing the wrecked Porsche out. Sarah saw Mr.Kent come running up.\n\"Clark! Sarah!\" he shouted as he came up. \"Kids. Are you allright?\"\n\"We're fine dad,\" Sarah said slightly annoyed\n\"Who's that maniac that was driving that car!\"\n\"That would be me,\" answered the man that Clark rescued. \"Lex Luthor,\"\nLex put up his hand as in a gesture to shake Mr.Kent's hand. Mr. Kent just looked at him\n\"I'm Jonathon Kent,\" he said instead. \"These are my kids,\"\nMr.Kent took off his jacket and draped it around Sarah's shoulders.\n\"Thanks for saving my life,\" Lex said to Clark.\n\"I'm sure you would've done the same thing,\" Clark answered\nThe Kents started walking away, but Lex stopped them\n\"You've got extraordinary kids Mr. Kent,\" he said. \"If there's any way I could repay you...\"\nMr. Kent turned around and said \"Drive slower,\"\nOn their way home from the accident, Sarah sat in the back of the truck, as Jonathon talked to them in a stern voice.\n\"Why didn't you two come home on the bus?\" he asked.\n\"I was busy,\" Clark said.\n\"Yeah right!\" shouted Sarah. \"I saw what you were doing. You were at tryouts!\"\nJonathon looked at Clark with a stern look. Clark glared at Sarah, and looked at his father.\n\"I didn't try out,\" he said. \"I just went to support Pete,\"\n\"But you know you're supposed to pick up Sarah and take the bus from her school when it stopped there,\"\n\"She's a big girl dad. She can walk home, and take the bus by herself. I don't need to babysit her everyday,\"\n\"But you're mother doesn't want her walking home by herself. It'll make her feel relaxed if she knows that you'll be there to pick up Sarah,\"\nSarah said nothing as Clark and Jonathon continued arguing. They stopped on the farm, and Mrs. Kent came out of the house with a worried expression. Sarah came out of the car, and her mother engulfed her in a hug.\n\"I was so worried,\" she said. \"Are you two all right?\"\n\"They're fine Martha,\" Jonathon explained. \"Clark, Sarah go upstairs and change into warm clothes. You're mother and I are gonna talk,\"\nClark and Sarah went inside the house. Clark was clearly angry for turning him in to Mr. Kent at Sarah.\n\"I can't believe you told him I was there,\" he said. \"He thinks I was trying out,\"\n\"Well it woudn't have happened if you were there to pick me up. Then I wouldn't have snitched. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a shower filled with hot water with my name on it,\" Sarah said going into the bathroom\nThat night, Sarah sat on her bed reading Bram Stokers \"Dracula\". There was a knock on the door, and she slightly jumped.\n\"Come in,\" she said.\nMrs. Kent came in with a smile on her face. She had a bowl of chicken noddle soup, crackers, and a glass of milk.\n\"You and Clark gave us quite a scare today,\" she said.\n\"Sorry,\" Sarah apoligized.\nMrs.Kent sat by Sarah's bed, and gave her the tray of food.\n\"Mom,\" Sarah started. \"Is there something you and Dad know that I should know?\"\n\"Why?\" asked Mrs. Kent\n\"Because I saw Clark get hit by the car at 60 miles per hour. And when I saw him after that, he didn't have a bone broken or a scratch on his skin,\"\nMrs. Kent was silent at Sarah's response. She put a hand on Sarah's cheek\n\"You're still too young to know things about your brother. Even he doesn't know what goes on around him,\" she said softly. \"You'll know when the time is right to know what goes on in life. Now eat your soup, and get to bed...and no more horror books. You'll have nightmares for weeks,\"\nSarah smiled.\n\"Sure. Night mom,\" she whispered.\nThe next day, Sarah and Clark were on their way up the road home from school. They hadn't said a word to each other since yesterday. But that was off Sarah's mind when she saw something that glued her eyes permanetly. There was a red electric scooter with a black helmet sitting on its seat. Behind it was a red and white truck with a bow on its grid.\n\"Whoa!\" she said. \"Mom, who's stuff?\"\n\"Yours and Clark's,\" Martha said coming up\n\"Which one's mine? The truck?\"\n\"Very funny Sarah,\"\nSarah laughed, and looked at the card that was stuck on the helmet on the scooter\nDear Sarah\nCareful with this, and always ride safely with a helmet. And be thankful it only goes to 15 miles per hour\nSincerly,\nThe maniac from the Porsche\nSarah smiled as she read the note.\n\"Where're the keys?\" asked Clark\n\"Your father has them,\" answered Martha\nSarah's smiled faded into a frown. Something was wrong, and she knew it had something to do with her father and Lex Luthor. She followed Clark, and found Mr. Kent putting wood into a large wood chipper. Mr. Kent noticed them watching, and he stopped.\n\"I know how much you want it kids,\" he said. \"But you can't keep them\"\n\"Why not?\" asked Clark \"I saved the guys life\"\n\"So you think you and your sister deserve a prize?\"\n\"That's not what I meant. How about I drive the old one and you drive the new one. Everybody wins,\"\n\"This isn't about winning Clark,\"\n\"Well it's not like the Luthors can't afford it,\"\n\"Uh, I'm gonna go up to the loft and do my homework,\" said Sarah going upstairs\nClark and Jonathon didn't even seem to notice Sarah leaving, and they continued their disagreement. But Sarah stayed and listened, just to be entertained\n\"Do you know why that is?\" asked Jonathon. \"Do you remember Mr. Bell? We used to go fishing on his property. How about Mr. Guy? He used to send us pumpkins every Halloween. Well Lionel Luthor promsied cut them in on a deal. He sent them flashy gifts. Only once they sold him their property, he went back on his word. He evicted them son,\"\n\"So you're judging Lex for what his father did?\" asked Clark\n\"No Clark, I just want you to know where the money came from that bought that car,\"\nClark looked at his father in a disapproving way. He started to go upstairs to the loft.\n\"Clark, I know you're upset,\" said Jonathon. \"But it's normal...\"\nSarah watched Clark throw down his bag on the stairs, and come back down.\n\"Normal?\" he asked.\nClark turned on the wood chipper and held up his fist.\n\"How about this? Is this normal?\"\nWithout another word, Clark plunged his hand into the wood chipper. His father, in a panic, tried to stop him. He turned off the machine, and dug Clarks hand out. But, to Sarah's amazement, his hand was still attached. Only his shirt was tattered.\n\"I didn't dive in after Lex's car,\" he said. \"It hit me a 60 miles an hour. Does that sound normal to you? I'd give anything to be normal,\"\nClark ran upstairs to the loft. Sarah hurridly went up to the couch, and quickly took out her books to make it look like she was studying and didn't hear a thing. She didn't even say anything mean to him the whole time they were even up there. In fact, they didn't say anything to each other at all. She still couldn't believe it. Her parents were keeping a secret from her all these years. Her brother, Clark Kent, had superpowes. It all made sense. The crash, how he didn't get hurt, everything.\n\"I'll be right back,\" she said quietly getting up and going downstairs.\n\"Sarah,\" Clark started. \"Did you dive in after me yesterday, or did you really fall in?\"\nSarah took a deep breath, and looked at Clark, almost in a loving way.\n\"I dove in after you guys, because I thought I was going to lose a brother that was the only thing that kept me going through my life,\" she said silently. \"Would you have done the same for me if I was driving 60 miles an hour and drove off a bridge?\"\nClark was silent, but then he nodded. Sarah smiled, but she turned back.\n\"Oh and Clark,\" she said. \"This conversation, never happened,\"\nClark laughed a little bit as Sarah went outside that led the way to the house. When she opened the door, she saw her parents in the kitchen.\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" she asked as she walked in. \"Why didn't you tell me that Clark had these abilities? It would've answered all my questions,\"\n\"We wanted to protect you and Clark,\" said Jonathon calmly.\n\"From what? Aliens? FBI agents? Wacked-out scientists? Tell me. I'm tired of lies. I wanna know the truth and I wanna know it now!\"\n\"Sarah, the reason Clark has these abilities, is... well his biological parents weren't exactly from around here,\"\n\"Really? Where were they from? Another planet? Did you stash Clark's spaceship in the attic?\"\n\"Actually, sweetheart, it's in the storm cellar,\"\nSarah couldn't believe what she was hearing. She shook her head as she went upstairs\n\"I'm spending the night at Allisons.\" she said defiantly. \"I don't wanna stay here for the night,\"\n\"Sarah...\" Jonathon started.\n\"Jonathon, let her go.\" Martha said. \"It was bound to happen one day. You knew this day would come. Besides, there's no school tomorrow. She just needs to get this off her chest. She'll understand. Beside's, I think this will help Clark and her get along,\"\nSarah walked briskly upstairs to the loft to get her bookbag. Clark was there, and he knew something was wrong.\n\"You okay?\" he asked.\n\"No I am NOT okay,\" she said as if she was hurrying to go somewhere. \"Something's horribly wrong, and right now I'm officially freaked out,\"\n\"What's wrong?\" he asked.\n\"Nothing. But I have to get out of here. I'm going to Allisons for the night. Brianna will be there. Sort of like a sleepover you know?\"\n\"Sarah, something's going on. Maybe I can help,\"\n\"No! If you want to help me, you can just leave me alone. I don't need anyone's help,\"\nBefore Clark could stop her, Sarah was out of there.\nAt Allison's house, Brianna and Allison were laughing and jumping around to music. Sarah just sat on the couch in her pajamma's hugging her pillow.\n\"Hey Sarah!\" shouted Brianna. \"What's the matter with you?\"\n\"Nothing,\" said Sarah.\nBrianna and Allison looked at each other. Allison turned off the music, and she and Brianna sat down by Sarah.\n\"Are you homesick?\" asked Allison. \"Do you want me to call your mom?\"\n\"No, it's not that,\" Sarah said.\n\"Hey I know what'll cheer you up! Brianna, if you had to choose one person in your family to kick out, who would you pick and why?\"\n\"It doesn't take a genius to know this one,\" Brianna said in her 'duh' voice. \"My brother Greg, because if he was out of the house, I can go through a night's sleep without worrying about his spiders coming into my room. I hate spiders,\"\n\"That's good. Sarah, if you had to pick one person in your family to kick out, who would you pick and why?\"\n\"It doesn't take a genius to know this one either, Ali,\"\n\"I don't know,\" answered Sarah.\n\"You don't know?\" asked Allison and Brianna in unison.\n\"I don't get it,\" said Brianna. \"I'd expect you to say Clark or something, and that he gets on your nerves 24/7.\"\n\"Well...can you guys keep a secret?\" asked Sarah\n\"I'm the Fort Knox of secrets. Although I don't know about Allison,\"\n\"Hey! I can keep a secret, as long as it doesn't involve family members that'll totally ruin their lives,\"said Allison\n\"How many secrets went into that criteria?\"\n\"None so far,\"\n\"Well you better keep this one,\" said Sarah. \"Because it involves family members,\"\n\"What is it?\" asked Brianna\nSarah wiggled her finger, as a gesture for them to huddle around.\n\"Okay,\" she whispered. \"Yesterday, on my way home from school, Lex Luthor was driving down the street 60 miles an hour on the bridge by the Talon,\"\n\"You mean that coffee shop that's been closed for what? A century?\" asked Allison.\n\"Actually it's been closed for about 56 years I think,\" Brianna said.\n\"Yeah, that coffee shop,\" Sarah said. \"Anyway Clark was by the bridge, and when the car went out of control, it crashed into him, and they both fell off the bridge,\"\n\"And you saw the whole thing? What'd you do?\"\n\"I dove in after them,\"\n\"That's a side I never saw...Wait a minute. Clark got hit by a car that was speeding 60 miles an hour? That would've killed him.\"\n\"That's what I thought! But he was still alive, and he did save Lex Luthor's life,\"\n\"Oooh. Did you guys get presents? I heard if you get on a rich guys rich side, you strike it rich,\"\n\"Yeah. I got a scooter, but dad said I can't have it cause he doesn't like Lionel Luthor...Hang on. We're getting off the subject. Quit doing that!\"\n\"Sorry,\"\n\"Anyway, I decided to leave that accident alone, because I thought Clark just got lucky to get out of there with no broken bones, and no scratches. But this afternoon, he and my dad got into an arguemant, and he put his hand in the wood chipper,\"\n\"Your brother's nuts!\" Allison said. \"What happened to his hand?\"\n\"Nothing. Ansolutely nothing. It was still there when dad pulled it out. And right before I left, I got into an argument with my parents, and they told me that they got a spaceship in the storm cellar, and that Clark's from another planet,\"\n\"OK,\" Allison said. \"Let me get this straight. Clark got hit by a speeding car that was supposed to kill him but didn't. Then he saved Lex Luthor's life, and you two just got flashy gifts that your dad won't let you have. Then, your brother decided to commit suicide and put his hand in a dangerous machine that should've left him handless, but it hardly left a scratch on him. Then you find out that he's from outer space, and now you've got a brother that's an alien?\"\n\"Yeah...Do you guys believe me?\"\n\"Well, since you've never lied to us before, and you're brother does have some weird streaks in him...\" Brianna started.\n\"Like what?\"\n\"Like how he got to class in time yesterday when he missed the bus,\"\n\"How'd you know that?\"\n\"Chloe told me when Allison and I took the bus yesterday afternoon,\"\n\"So Clark's some sort of alien?\" asked Allison. \"I always thought of him as some sort of geeky person,\"\n\"He's not like that,\"Sarah answered. \"So are you guys gonna keep a secret, or bring the circus to my house asking for a teenage boy who can lift anything at any weight beyond avergae?\"\n\"We'll keep a secret,\" said Brianna. She turned to Allison. \"Won't we Ali?\"\n\"I won't tell a soul,\" grinned Allison\nA week went by, and the girls were sitting in science class listening about Genetics. It was ironic for Sarah since genetics was mainly the problem of the week for her. When the teacher wasn't looking though, she felt something tap her shoulder. She turned around and saw Brianna, hunched over her desk toward Sarah's back.\n\"Look out the window,\" she whispered.\nSarah did what Brianna asked. Out the window was an ambulence and a crowd. Suddenly, the bell rang, and before everyone else could get up, Sarah, Brianna, and Allison ran out of the school and down the street to see the comotion. There was a man on a stretcher, and people were putting him in the ambulence.\n\"What's going on?\" asked Allison.\n\"Some electrical storm went up through the guy's body,\" said Pete as he and Chloe came up behind him. \"That's the third one this week,\"\n\"And they're all former jocks of Smallville High,\" Chloe added.\n\"That's strange,\" Brianna said. \"Who would send electricity through former jocks?\"\nSarah shrugged. \"Who knows?\"\nThe girls looked around everybody. They all had worried expressions on their faces. Except one. One had light brown hair, and his eyes were narrowed. Brianna tapped Chloe's shoulder\n\"Who's the weirdo?\" she asked\n\"I don't know,\" said Chloe as she took a picture of they weird guy. \"Let's check him out,\"\nLater, everyone, (Clark, Sarah, Brianna, Allison, Chloe, and Pete) were in Smallville High's Publications classroom where Clark and Chloe work on that Torch, Smallville High's school newspaper. Chloe was searching through an old School Yearbook she picked up from the library, until she stopped on one page.\n\"Here it is,\" she said setting it down on the table. \"His name's Jeremy Creek. This is a picture of him twelve years ago,\" Chloe pointed to a picture in the yearbook\n\"And this is the one Chloe took four hours ago,\" Brianna said showing another picture on the computer.\n\"No way.\" said Allison. \"That's impossible. This yearbook was what the 1989 edition? The guy should be 26 years old today. It-It has to be a kid that looks just like him. It can't be him,\"\n\"My money was on the evil twin theory,\" said Pete. \"That is 'till we checked this missing persons,\"\n\"Jeremy from the state infirmary a few days ago where he'd been in a coma for twelve years,\" Chloe explained. \"They say he suffered from massive electrolyte imbalance,\"\n\"That' why he hasn't aged a day,\" Pete pointed out\n\"So you're telling us he just woke up?\" asked Clark\n\"Well, no, there was a huge electrical storm, and the hospital's generator went down, and when the power came back on, Jeremy was gone,\" said Chloe\n\"So the electricity must've charged him up like a Duracell,\" said Allison getting the picture\n\"And now he's back in Smallville putting former jocks into comas,\" Sarah said\n\"Why?\" asked Clark\n\"Because twelve years ago today,\" Pete said. \"They chose Jeremy Creek as the scarecrow\"\nAllison took a newspaper clipping from Chloe's hands, and Brianna looked over her shoulder.\n\"'Comatose Boy Found In Field, Twenty Miles From Meteor Strike'\" Brianna read aloud.\n\"The exposure of the blast must've done something to his body\" Allison said\n\"No, this can't be right,\" Clark said.\n\"I think you ought to show Clark and Sarah,\" Pete said to Chloe\n\"Show us what?\" asked Sarah\nChloe led everyone to a room. Pete turned on the light, and Sarah gasped. There were newspaper clippings everywhere completely covering one wall\n\"It started out as a scapbook and it just kind of mutated,\" Chloe explained\n\"Cool!\" said Allison\nBrianna smacked Allison upside the head.\n\"What'd I do?\" Allison asked innocently\n\"What is it?\" asked Clark\n\"I call it the 'Wall of Weird'\" Chloe said, standing in front of the wall. 'It's every strange, bizzare, and unexplained that happened in Smallville since the meteor shower. That's when it all began. When the town went schitzo. What do you think?\"\n\"Why didn't you tell me about this?\" asked Clark moving toward the wall\n\"Do you tell me everything happens in your life?\" asked Chloe. \"We all keep secrets Clark,\"\nSarah watched Clark look around the wall, until he stopped at one picture.\n\"Lana?\" he whispered to himself. \"My fault. It's all my fault,\"\nSarah looked at Clark as he rushed out of the room. She knew he had a crush on Lana Lang, the girl next door, but why was he saying that it was all is fault? She looked at everybody else, and went out to find him. But when she went outside, she couldn't.\n\"Clark?\" she called out. \"Clark!\"\nBut no answer came. Brianna and Allison came out behind her.\n\"Where is he?\" Brianna asked.\n\"I don't know,\" Sarah said shrugging.\n\"I think he used one of his abilities to get out of here as fast as he can,\" Allison pointed out.\n\"In the middle of broad daylight Allison?\" asked Sarah. \"I've gotta find him,\"\nSarah started running across the street to her bike. Allison and Brianna looked at each other, and almost instantly started running with her\n\"Wait up!\" shouted Brianna. \"We're coming with you!\"\nSoon, Sarah, Brianna, and Allison were running their bikes full speed down the streets of the small Smallville town. They sped past cars, and other people that were crossing the street. Suddenly, Brianna stopped her bike. She saw Jeremy walking down the sidewalk briskly.\n\"Hey!\" she called out to Sarah and Allison.\nSarah and Allison rode their bikes down to where Brianna was. She pointed at Jeremy\n\"Let's follow him,\" she said.\n\"I don't think that's a good idea Brianna,\" said Allison. \"Come to think of it, you've never had any good ideas. Besides you know what he did to those guys. You wanna get fried by a freakishly weird guy who electrocutes people into comas?\"\n\"I don't care. I've got a hunch.\"\n\"Brianna may be right,\" Sarah said. \"Come on. Let's go,\"\n\"Argh! But it's nearly six, and it's almost dark, and I'm hungry,\" Allison complained\n\"We'll get you something to eat when we find out what he's up to,\" Sarah said. \"Come on,\"\nSarah and Allison followed Brianna. As they rode their bikes, Sarah took out her cell phone and called her parents\n\"Mom?\" she spoke in the phone\n\"Oh my gosh. Sweetheart we were worried sick. Are you all right?\" came Martha's voice\n\"I'm fine. Is Clark home?\"\n\"No. We thought he was with you. Is he with you?\"\n\"No. But I'm with Allison and Brianna and we're looking for him. I'll be home soon. I promise. I love you. Bye,\"\n\"Sarah...\"\nSarah didn't get to hear what Martha had to say when she hung up the cell phone\n\"Did you tell her that we're following a maniac into Luthor Corp fields?\" asked Brianna\n\"I figured if I told her that, my dad would hit the roof,\" Sarah said, as she set down her bike on the curb by the field\n\"We shouldn't be here guys,\" saide Allison turning on her emergency flashlight. \"This is government property. You know what they do to people who sneak around here? They experiment on them. Question them like 'Who are you working for' or 'What was your motive if you succeded in invading my corporation'\"\n\"That's just a figmant of your imagination, Allison,\" Brianna said. \"Before my brother became a 'buggy' person, he used to scare the heck out of me saying stuff about monster spiders that took over the world. None of that experimentation is real,\"\nThe girls walked through the corn stalks in the dark. A couple of times they tripped, but they had each other for support. Suddenly, Sarah heard something rustle in the stalks. Allison let out a short scream, and tried to shine her light on something, but it dropped and that glass shattered.\n\"Nice one Allison!\" shouted Brianna.\"Now we can't see a thing,\"\n\"It's not my fault, I get easily freaked. I'm not the one with a brother who's obbsessed with freaky bugs!\" Allison shouted back.\n\"Hey!\" shouted a voice. \"What are you kids doing here?\"\nThe girls turned their heads, and saw Lex Luthor with a flashlight.\n\"That's it!\" shouted Allison. \"I told you we were gonna get caught! We're done for!\"\n\"Hey,\" Lex said, waving his flashlight around. \"I'm not gonna hurt any of you...Sarah Kent?\"\n\"Hi Lex,\" Sarah waved\n\"What are you doing in the middle of the night of my company corn field?\"\n\"We were tracking down someone. You haven't seen anybody out of the ordinary have you?\"\n\"I did see someone walk past here. I thought he did something around here, and I went to investigate. But I never thought I'd find three teenage girls in the middle of the night walking around my cornfield,\"\n\"Help me,\" a voice sounded\nLex flashed his light behind the girls. Sarah knew that voice anywhere.\n\"Clark,\" she whispered\nSarah started running through the field, with Lex, Allison, and Brianna behind her. Sarah skidded into a clearing, and could not believe what she saw. There was Clark, tied to a scarecrow post, in his boxer shorts, and a big red \"S\" painted on his chest. Lex came up behind her.\n\"Oh no,\" he whispered.\nLex went behind the post, and started to untie Clark while Sarah got his clothes that was right down beside them\n\"Who did this to you?\" Sarah asked defiantly.\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Clark whispered as he jumped down and grabbed his pants.\nClark suddenly drops to his knees, and something fell from his neck. It was a necklace with an emerald gem. Almost instantly he got up, feeling more strong.\n\"Clark you need to see a doctor,\" Brianna said as she and Allison came up\n\"I'll be okay,\" Clark said quickly\nSoon Clark was running through the feilds. Sarah started running after him. She'd get her bike later, and she knew that Brianna and Allison would be safe getting a ride home from Lex. But she was worried about her brother.\n\"Clark!\" she shouted. \"You are not leaving me out here by myself!\"\nSuddenly, Clark came up behind her. She turned around, and looked at him with a stern face.\n\"Listen,\" she said. \"I know you have these abilities. So do Brianna and Allison. But I'm not gonna tell anyone. They're not gonna tell anyone. You know why? Because they're your friends, and my friends, and I'm your sister, and I don't tell anybody anything, unless it's okay to tell. There. I said it. Even though you are sometimes annoying, you are my brother, and I love you...And I don't want anything to happen to you,\"\nClark couldn't believe what he was hearing. There was his little twelve-year-old sister, that despised him, and he did too, saying that he loved him, and didn't want anything to happen to him?\n\"I don't want you leaving me behind, like you always do,\" Sarah whispered. \"I'm going with you,\"\n\"Well,\" Clark said finally. \"You're gonna have to ride my shoulders the whole way. Because you don't have the same speed as I do,\"\nSarah smiled as Clark bent over a bit. She wrapped her arms around his neck, and Clark put his hands under her thighs.\n\"Ready?\" he asked. \"One, Two, Three!\"\nClark lifted Sarah off the ground, and put him on his shoulders.\n\"Hang on tight,\" he warned\nSarah nodded, and Clark took off in a flash. Her hair was blowing hard in the wind, and she was laughing with happiness and joy. Maybe having a super brother a brother wouldn't be so bad. Before she knew it they stopped, and Clark put her down.\n\"That was fun!\" she said. \"...Hey. Where are we?\"\n\"The ally behind the high school,\" explained Clark.\n\"Where's Jeremy?\"\n\"I don't know. Let's split up. Hopefully we'll find him,\"\nSarah nodded, and walked to the other side of the building, while listening to the sound of hip hop from inside the gym. The high school-ers were having their Homecoming Dance, and it sounded like they were having a good time. Soon she saw Jeremy opening up the fire sprinkler system box.\n\"You have to stop this Jeremy,\" Sarah said coming up to him as Clark came up behind her\nJeremy looked up and saw Clark with a serious look on his face\n\"I don't know how you got here,\" he said. \"But you shoud've stayed away,\"\n\"I won't let you hurt my friends,\" Clark warned\n\"Those people in there aren't your friends. The sprinklers will get them all nice and wet. I'll handle the rest,\"\n\"Electrocuting innocent people isn't going to solve any problems,\" Sarah said. \"You need help.\"\n\"What happened to you was my fault,\" Clark said. \"I can understand your pain,\"\n\"I'm not in pain,\" Jeremy almost shouted. \"I have a gift, and a purpose, and a destiny,\"\nJeremy turned around, only to find that Clark was still staring right into his face\n\"So do I,\" Clark whispered\nJeremy started to get angry, In order to electrocute him, he put his hands on Clark, sparks shooting from his fingers.Clark, using his super strength, threw him into a car\n\"Give it up Jeremy!\" he shouted.\nBut Jeremy wouldn't listen. He put his hand on the truck and sprung it to life. He got in and tried to run Clark over. He smashed him into a wall that also smashed a water hydrant. The water bursted out, and got onto Clark and the car, electrocuting Jeremy. Sarah could only watch in shock. She went over to Clark as he pulled the drivers car door off it's hinges. Jeremy looked at them in confusion.\n\"You okay?\" asked Sarah\n\"Who are you?\" asked Jeremy. \"Where am I?\"\n\"I'm Clark Kent,\" Clark said\n\"And I'm Sarah Kent,\" Sarah said.\n\"And you're in Smallville,\"\n\n\nDOCUMENT 8:\n\nClark Kent, aka Superman, is ... Clark secretly fought crime around his hometown during his high school years and moonlit as a ... When Ollie asks if Clark Kent has ... Clark Kent - Smallville Wiki - Wikia Clark Kent | Smallville Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nSeason Eleven\nSuperman's updated suit.\nSix months later , Clark lives with Lois in their Metropolis apartment. He is no longer known as The Blur to the public, instead he is known by the name of Superman which was dubbed to him by Lois after he had saved humanity from Darkseid's Apokolips. At some point, after his public debut, Clark updated his Superman costume.\nClark and Lois in their apartment.\nAt home with Lois , Clark showers and brushes his teeth, talking with her about the energy ribbon - or \"aurora\" - that attacked the space station. As he then makes breakfast, he asks if they should return the wedding presents they received. Lois states that the wedding was postponed not cancelled, so they shouldn't have to.\nAs they lament their independently busy lives - he with saving the Earth, she with becoming a pre-eminent reporter - Lois mentions that the Russians have already announced they will be commissioning a statue of Superman to commemorate his saving of the space station. Clark expresses his discomfort at the hero worship, but Lois assures him that it is inspiring people, just as he wanted to do with the suit. Clark states that he'd like to finally tell the Earth that Superman is an alien. Lois counters that with all of the concern brought on by the pictures of the aliens on Apokolips, it might not be the best time, especially with Lex Luthor making such noise about it in public.\nLois discourages Clark from revealing to the Earth that he's an alien.\nLex and Clark.\nRecently, he saved a Russian space station from a mysterious explosion. Later, in his mild-mannered disguise, Clark met Lex Luthor on the street. Lex introduced himself to Clark, because he doesn't remember Clark. Luthor only knows from the video clips that they were friends when they were young. He hardly recognized Kent. Clark is surprised that Lex knew that they were friends years ago. Lex doesn't understand how they could ever have been friends. Clark responded with: \"As you said, we were younger.\"\nClark saves Oliver.\nMeanwhile Green Arrow patrols the city and arrives to the Port of Metropolis, in order to apprehend a crew of thieves who attempts to raid a shipping container.He's surprised by one of the goons who has climbed on top of a stack of containers and trains an RPG launcher on the Emerald Archer. Before Ollie can react, the goon fires. Just before the RPG strikes him, Superman zips into the area and stands in front of it, shielding Ollie from the hit and the explosion.\nClark and Oliver after stopping the criminals.\nSuperman knocks the crew out and ties the bunch together around a pole. A short time after, Ollie and Clark, now in street clothes, watch as Metropolis PD comes by to apprehend the thieves. Ollie's a bit surprised Clark didn't stay in costume to greet the police, joking that Superman is \"all about b standing around, shaking hands, kissing babies...\" As they walk off, Clark retorts that Superman has never kissed a baby. When Ollie asks if Clark Kent has, Clark mentions an exploding baby from his past. When Ollie exults about not having to experience such things when the Queens move to Star City , Clark expresses surprise that they haven't left yet. They were supposed to have left but Ollie says the hold-up is on his wife.\nClark searching through space.\nIn space, Superman talks to Watchtower over their communication network, as he accesses the holo-computer in his belt. He is scanning for hints at the cause of the storm and finds none, noting he used his whole spectrum of Super-Vision. In S.T.A.R. Labs, Chloe and Emil discuss the development of Clark's powers. Emil states Virgil Swann founded the facility as a way to help The Traveler develop his abilities. Clark ask if they could have sent one of their Environmental Hazard Drones instead, and Emil apologizes for having to send Clark instead. Clark checks his belt buckle communicator and finds a message from Lois , telling him he is late for the conference, much to Clark's dismay. Clark then uses his superspeed and arrives to the conference and saw Lois asking Lex where he disappeared to after he was declared dead and before Tess's death which leads Lex to defend himself. Clark shows up and whispers to Lois that they both know Lex killed Tess, but can't do anything without proof. Lex then begins criticizing Superman and the Justice League , claiming they have failed to protect humanity and now the Earth is in more danger than ever. He announces the Guardian orbital defense platforms as a means of protection and the public is impressed, save for Lois and Clark. She ask who will pilot the Shuttle to bring the satellites into orbit on such short notice, and Lex introduces the pilot, Commander Hank Henshaw .\nClark interviews Hank Henshaw.\nClark interviews Hank Henshaw one last time before the LuthorCorp shuttle takes flight, as Hank eats a large meal, claiming it's apart of a superstition pilots like him share. Hank then makes a passionate quote about piloting, and how it helps him appreciate what he has on Earth, and says that Lex has given him a greater purpose, allowing him to pilot The Guardian Platforms into space. Clark claims that the world isn't as dark as Lex claims, and Hank mockingly ask if Clark is a Superman fan. Hank then claims that Superman is doing a good job, but should do more. Clark says that it's best Superman not impose his ideas on all. Hank says it's a good idea, but sometimes people need to be forced. Clark thanks him for the interview as Hank goes off to get ready.\nClark flying toward the Shuttle.\nDuring takeoff, Lois tells Clark she has a bad feeling about the Guardian platforms, but Clark claims it might be a good thing, as Superman can't be everywhere at once, but Lois isn't convinced. Clark claims that Hank is trustworthy, but Lois claims Lex is still dangerous. Aboard the Shuttle, Hank begins leaving Orbit, when the ship begins experiencing problems. In mid-air, it explodes. Clark runs off and changes into his Superman suit, with Chloe guiding him from Watchtower. Superman catches up to the shuttle and sets out the fire caused by the explosion, and removes the last fuel tank before it explodes. Using his gamma vision, he's able to see that there is a radiation leak.\nClark and Hank reach an agreement.\nSuperman has Chloe contact Commander Henshaw through LexCorp mission control, where he informs them that he can save them, but needs to pry open the shuttle as it will depressurize, but Henshaw insist that Superman save his crew members first, in order to pilot the shuttle into orbit as the shuttle is leaking radiation. But before Superman leaves to save the crew, Henshaw reveals a secret. Superman saves the crew and returns to the shuttle as the oxygen levels reach zero and Henshaw passes out.\nCommander Henshaw awakens.\nHenshaw wakes up on a stretcher, with burns from the radiation exposure. As the paramedics begin to transport him, Superman instructs them to send him to Emil at S.T.A.R. Labs. Lois comes up to Superman, hoping for a quote, but he instead tells her that Clark will not be home for breakfast, because the explosion was not a misfire.\nAt LexCorp Plaza , Lex arrives in his penthouse office, as Superman angrily breaks his glass window by clapping. Superman accuses Lex of activating the Guardian Platform mid-flight, but Lex dismisses the claim, saying the accident could have been avoided had the military not forced the private sectors hand. Superman accuses him again, nearly attacking him, until three military helicopters show up, demanding that Superman step away from Lex. Lex claims that Superman's appearance at the Korolyov and Guardian incidents, as well as his apparent attack of LexCorp Plaza, Superman had given Sam Lane a reason to intervene. The military tell him he is under arrest, but Superman refuses as the military ready their guns.\nSuperman is fired upon by the military.\nSuperman is fired upon by the military helicopter under the orders of General Lane. During the confrontation Clark receives a call from Lois, whom he asked if her father knows       his secret identity, saying that he had implied it before . Lois reassures him that if General Lane knew that he was firing upon his own son-in-law he'd probably wouldn't have fired at him. As they surround Superman they begin firing, Lois seeks cover under her convertible.\nSuperman saves Lois much to the surprise of General Lane.\nThe bullets deflect off of Superman and hit the tail rotor of one of the helicopters,which begins to fall to the street below. Superman flies down and saves Lois before the helicopter crashes onto of her car, and explodes. High above in the clouds Lois is wrapped in a romantic embrace with Clark followed by a passionate kiss.\nGeneral Lane talks to Superman.\nSuperman then returns to downtown Metropolis where he proceeds to clean up the mess made by the military during their field test of his abilities before the arrival of the fire department where he leaves a calling card apologizing. Superman then meets with General Lane at Liberty park where they have a discussion about his recent heroics but also the fear members of Washington DC have against him as he has no real accountability to the government only to his moral code. Superman suggest to General Lane that he'd be up to going to Washington DC to meet with the President, just when he's suddenly summoned by Emil's signal watch to S.T.A.R. Labs. Emil informs Clark via his Bluetooth earpiece that Lex had transferred Hank Henshaw's mind into one of his EH drones however the process made his mind unstable.\nHank rages on Superman.\nSuperman tries to stop Hank.\nSuperman offers his help to Hank.\nSuperman arrives at S.T.A.R. Labs. confronting cybernetic Henshaw who engages him in an intense battle of sheer super strength as Henshaw's cyborg body is able to adapt and counter any of Superman's abilities as he demonstrated by throwing Superman through ten buildings. Superman tries to reason with Henshaw after punches some sense into him.\nHenshaw apologizes to Superman.\nSuperman manages to disconnect Henshaw long enough to calm him down and returns him to S.T.A.R. Labs to an isolation unit where he is connected to a computer interface. Superman meets with Terri Henshaw informing her that he's made special arrangements for her to see her husband whenever she wanted too. Before he leaves Superman sees Henshaw who apologizes to him and asked Superman how he manages to do the right thing.\nSuperman confronts Luthor to discover a horrible truth.\nThe next Morning in Metropolis, Superman pays a visit to Lex Luthor at LexCorp where he attempts to apologizes for misjudging him before on their last encounter . Only to discover that the Guardian shuttle incident was a no accident it was a means for Lex to coat Superman with an isotope radiation that he could track Superman's whereabouts anywhere on Earth with his satellites. Superman realizes what this means and angrily threaten Lex this isn't over as he leaves.\nClark makes a solemn promise to Lois.\nFloating above the Daily Planet rooftop, Clark awaits for Lois who arrives hoping to find \"Clark Kent\" only to see Superman instead. Superman tells her that \"Clark Kent\" will be taking an extended leave of absence. He wouldn't risk leading Lex Luthor into their lives because he could track his whereabouts with the radiation. Lois is angry with this startling revelations and wants to hurt Lex. But Clark forbids it. Lois then suggest that Clark uses his Heat vision to destroy Lex's satellites but Clark says that isn't the answer either. Clark tries to comfort Lois but she is still uneasy about the whole situation, Clark reassures her that he'll find away to come back home to her. He kisses her tenderly then flies away.\nClark hears Lois' voice.\nLater that night as the rest of Metropolis sleeps peacefully, Clark is floating above in space overlooking Earth and hears Lois's voice who reaffirms her love for him.\nClark and Lois at the Fortress.\n3 weeks later , Clark and Lois are finally able to spend some time together, but they are still dealing with Lex tracking Clark. They are at the Fortress , and Oliver made sure one of his satellites blocked Lex's for one second so Clark and Lois could teleport to the Fortress without Lex knowing. Clark also revealed to Lois that after he completed his trials and made peace with Jor-El, his computer program ended. The fortress as well as the knowledge of the galaxies are now Clark's to use as he sees fit. So far Clark has used it to shield his radiographic signature from Lex's keyhole satellite and to find a way to remove the isotope from his system.\nThe Following Morning, Clark returns Lois to Metropolis and takes her directly to Daily Planet basement. He then files towards a hostage situation across town in which an unknown gunman has a group of children held hostage above within a bus. While the police attempt to handle the situation with diplomacy. Superman uses his Heat vision to disarm the gun from the assailant and quickly grabs him and pulls him out from the roof of the bus with his Super strength and holds unto him with a firm grip. Superman then turns his attention to the children and address a boy who previous attempted to be a hero by standing up to the gunman who pointed a gun at his face. Superman tells the boy not to be reckless especially around gun as they are not toys. Superman returns his attention to the assailant only to discover that he's got the ability of Teleportation and uses that ability to free himself and to fire at the police unit below using his Super speed Superman intercepted every bullet in his hand and converted it into a ball then handing it to Dan Turpin before pursuing the teleporter who stood on a nearby roof, Superman arrives and confronts him only to discover that he was using the hostage crisis to distract Superman from a robbery that was in progress and that he had placed a bomb on the crane holding the bus with children as an insurance to prevent Superman from touching him with a remote detonator. Superman uses his Arctic breath to freeze the teleporter in place then uses his heat vision to thaw his head while he interrogates him on who sold him the tech suit equipped with teleportation, The teleporter refusing to corporate, Superman uses his X-ray vision to see that the tech is from LexCorp .\nAfter he take care of the bomb, Superman round up the teleportation thieves who apologize to the children for kidnapping them, hitching their school bus up on a crane, and then trying to blow them up with a bomb. As Superman politely soars off with one of the teleportation vests, Dan Turpin meets Bruce Wayne and Barbara Gordon visiting Metropolis who got to see Superman in action first hand.Barbara is more impressed than Bruce is, or more impressed than Bruce is letting on. Bruce however reveals that it looks like Superman is taken.\nBruce Wayne analyzes Clark's love life.\nLater, at the Ace of Clubs , Lex and Bruce have their lunch meeting on the patio while Barbara Gordon is having lunch with Otis. Lex and Bruce's lunch however is prematurely ended by Superman.\nSuperman needs to talk to Lex.\nLater, at Lexcorp R&D, Superman and Lex are all forced friendly-like as Lex analyzes the teleportation vest and admits the technology is his, but it was stolen. Stolen, in fact, during a series of robberies made on Lexcorp and other companies, one of which was foiled way back by the Green Arrow and Superman. Lex surmises that whomever created these teleportation vests using all that stolen technology would have to be very familiar with Lexcorp's patents and proprietary coding. Which leads Superman to Stryker's Island prison and The Toyman . Safely incarcerated and seemingly not a suspect, according to Warden Draper, since he's been under constant supervision in \"hyper-solitary\". Superman is stymied. Meanwhile, imprisoned elsewhere at Stryker's is Bruno Mannheim , the head of Intergang , who's acting like a raving lunatic while palming the Crime Bible, which he says was given to him by G. Gordon Godfrey . Next thing we know, Mannheim has escaped his cell! Well, not so much escaped as being interrogated by The Batman . The Batman has Mannheim and he only wants to know where Joe Chill is. Mannheim claims he's gone straight, that the Crime Bible changed his life, and a lot of nonsense, but the Batman's having none of that. Next thing we know, Superman arrives on the scene.\nBatman vs. Superman.\nSuperman meets Batman and he wants to have a word with him. Instead, he gets Batman manifesting some sort of energy and then punched Superman. Batman and Superman do battle on Stryker's island. Batman with the advantage using red sun radiation generated from his suit. Superman discovers Bruce Wayne is Batman and manages to beat Batman and interrogates him on why he tried to free Bruno Mannheim, he said that he needed to find the man who murdered his parents. Superman is shocked and puts Batman down.\nBatman has a heart to heart with Superman.\nMeanwhile, Green Arrow and Nightwing haven't gotten the memo from their respective bosses that they've reached a détente and it's time to stop fighting. Evenly matched, Arrow and Nightwing have spilled arrows and Batarangs all over the place trying to smack each other down. Superman arrives to break up the fracas when Bruno Mannheim pleads for sanctuary from the Man of Steel. Superman then snatches Mannheim and takes him up, up, and away for questioning.\nSuperman interrogates Bruno Mannheim.\nIn the sky, Superman says he's sorry to be using extreme measures on Mannheim. Mannheim doesn't know anything, but Superman points out he's lying, and knows his better half will have a talk to him over this. Just then, in front of the Batwing, Mannheim falls from above before Superman catches him below. Mannheim spills the beans: Intergang wanted to protect themselves from the invasion , Mannheim decided against it but offered Joe Chill to help them. But now, Chill is off the grid, rumored to be in FBI custody. Superman grabs the tracking device and asks Batman if he catches that. The Batwing storms off, Superman takes that as a yes.\nMeanwhile at the Daily Planet, Superman helps Lois find him in the sky by sparking his heat vision. After the talk over what he did to Mannheim, Lois confirms Chill is in FBI custody. As for Toyman being a suspect, the answer is no, but Lois learns that an Oswald Loomis did try to visit Toyman dozens of times before turning away. Superman wants to talk with Batman again, and has a way into contacting him.At a supply ship called Leviathan docked in Metropolis is an HQ for Batman and Nightwing, where inside they are getting medical treatment. The cameras pick up something and Bruce decides to head out alone, while Barb is in the Hub, when he looks outside to see what it is: the Bat-Signal.\nBatman and Superman agree to team up.\nBatman arrives on the rooftop source of the signal to find Superman waiting for him. Superman knows enough about the Batman that this is the specific way to call a meeting with him. Superman also knows Batman and Nightwing located Joe Chill's safe house in Suicide Slum.Superman doesn't want Batman tearing through Suicide Slum hell bent on revenge for Joe Chill so he proposes \"a joint investigation mutually beneficial to both of us.\" They make sure Joe Chill is safe from Intergang and then find out who's manufacturing the weapons he's peddling and Batman agrees.\nAt Suicide Slum, Superman and Batman are on a stakeout. Batman is irritated by Superman's penchant for conversation but Superman seems to really be enjoying having a partner in crime fighting. Superman revealed that, he didn't want to draw attention to it and compromise Batman's security because he knows Lex Luthor is watching all his movements. Superman and Batman then scans the building and Batman's night vision goggles spot some extra snipers Superman missed when he bathed the building with X-rays. Batman then easily and stealthily penetrates the safe house and finds Joe Chill's room, though Superman beats him there with Super speed.At the safe house, Chill, a lifelong criminal, isn't exactly repentant about killing Batman's parents, whoever they were. Batman can't be specific and Chill has killed a lot of people for lots of reasons. This isn't good enough for Batman, who loses it, until Superman literally slaps him down. Superman calmly explains to Joe Chill that they're really here to find out where they can find a man named Loomis , who they believe is manufacturing the weapons Chill fenced for Intergang. But hey, they don't have to look very far because Loomis is already there! Batman and Superman spring into action with Heat Vision and Batarangs, but a burst of cold takes out both. Loomis isn't alone. He has help from Mr. Freeze .Superman and Batman are fighting Prankster and Mr. Freeze. Batman reveals that Mr. Freeze is Victor Fries. Prankster reveals that he wants to prove himself to Intergang. While Superman tries to distract the villains, Batman and Joe Chill try to escape. Superman gets shot by Kryptonite bullets while Mr. Freeze kills Joe Chill and frames Batman for the crime.\nBatman realizes that Superman is wounded.\nBatman frees himself, and sees that Chill is dead, and Superman is critically wounded. Batman contacts Nightwing to inform her about Superman's condition. The FBI comes in to arrest Batman. Batman escapes with Superman within the Batmobile. Then Daily Planet reporter Lois joins the police and the FBI in the pursuit chase.Upon dropping off his last passenger, a bus driver doses off in the middle of the street, only to be waken up by the Batmobile going through his bus. News stations cover the pursuit of the \"murderer Batman kidnapping a wounded Superman\" just as Lois and Ollie meet up (wondering where Batman is taking Superman) and Chloe is hacking into the traffic system so no one is hurt during the chase.\nInside the Batmobile: Nightwing comments on the stress she's feeling over Superman being hurt and Batman being chased, just as Superman tells Batman to call him Clark and Batman, relieved that Clark is still alive, asks him who to call to save him. Nightwing calls Chloe, who in turn calls a choked up Lois: Nightwing gives her the situation: Superman has four Kryptonite bullets, none to the heart, but his vitals are fading. Nightwing, later, gives Batman Lois' message: get the Kryptonite out, and then expose Superman to yellow sunlight . But as Batman says, he's already has his hands full.A road block is set up, with cops surrounded, so Batman can't \"go through it\" like before, so he comes up with a different idea. Shifting the front tires to a \"X\" position, and firing the boosters from below, the Batmobile literally goes around the road block from above. The cops, and even Lois and Ollie, can't believe what they saw. A helicopter approaches, with an EMP on board, and Batman knows this and but can't do anything about it, until Ollie messages him that he can. Ollie simply \"pops up\" to the helicopter, and it goes away. Nightwing takes control of the Batmobile, leading it outside the Leviathan ship. Batman performs the surgery inside the car, just as Lois arrives and she sees it happening. After getting the bullets out, Batman reprograms his vest and splash Clark with yellow sunlight, just as the police report that they lost the Batman. Chloe is relieved that it's over, but Batman and Nightwing respond that it isn't: they need to make sure that the authorities know it was Freeze and Prankster who killed Chill. Ollie agrees, but also asks for his lawyer to be called too (he's been arrested).\nSuperman and Batman with armored suits.\nInside Leviathan: Clark wakes up with Lois by his side, where Lois reveals the Earth still thinks Batman killed Superman, and she can't help but be tempted by the huge story she's been given: Batman isn't a myth, and is Bruce Wayne. Barbara Gordon, introducing herself to the two, gives Clark some orange juice before he heads out to speak with Bruce, who is hard at work at the armory. Bruce asks why Clark hasn't destroyed Lex' satellite, but Clark points out Lex would build more, and that he prefers hope and inspiration over fear and brute force (in a way, criticizing Bruce's Batman). Bruce tells Clark that he's been having a hard time finding Prankster and Freeze, because Freeze needs to be in extreme colds to survive: Clark points out the Hobbs River as an idea, but the list is too big. Then Clark has an idea: use Lex' tracking from himself to read other types of radiation, like Kryptonite. Bruce tries that, and then successfully, finds the villains' location. Given Clark's weaknesses, and Bruce still being human who can't survive colds 40 below: Bruce reveals what he has built: armored suits for Superman and Batman to fight in. In order to still keep a low profile, the two heroes head out into the sewers with another one of Batman's vehicles: the Batboat.\nBatman and Superman in Victor Fries's hideout.\nAt Freeze's hideout: Superman and Batman find no one there, at least until Prankster appears using a robotic suit Toyman was developing, complete with Kryptonite on the chest. He reveals that Freeze is under his control, and is attacking the citizens, but in actuality, his suit's fuel cells are overloading, and will explode. And with Freeze above the city's water purification plant, anyone within one mile will die. Batman heads out in the Batboat to take care of Freeze, while Superman goes to handle Prankster.\nIn Metropolis, the next morning, Lois Lane talks to Superman about the news headline of today. Superman and Batman have been hailed as heroes by the Daily Planet, labeled World's Finest in the paper. In Gotham, Superman speaks with Bruce Wayne about his (Bruce's) parents. Bruce puts the flowers down and reveals that he and Superman are at the spot where his parents died. Bruce and Superman agree to work together if necessary.\nSuperman and Martian Manhunter watching the H.E.D. Drones construct the Watchtower moon base.\nLater on the moon at the construction site for Queen Industries ' new Moon Base , Clark and Martian Manhunter oversee the construction which the S.T.A.R. Labs H.E.D drones help in the process. Clark shares some Double Stuff Oreo cookies with his friend and mentor when he receives an alert about an attack on Metropolis involving a former Project Ares subject. As Superman speeds off to deal with the threat, J'onn decides to return to his apartment in Metropolis.\nImpulse and Superman taking down Psimon.\nOut in the streets of Metropolis , a Dr. Jones who wants to be called Psimon is looking for Lex, whose Project Ares has apparently given the diminutive doctor his purple skin, an oversized and glowing-through-his-skull brain and some kind of indeterminate psycho-molecular power. Psimon is not convinced a peaceful resolution to this situation is possible and shoots a purple blast at Lex, whom Superman saves and proceeds to returns to finish with Psimon, who proves to be able to act more quickly than Superman thanks to his enhanced synaptic firing. As he tries to capture Psimon, the criminal's telepathic abilities allow him to \"feel\" Superman's moves before he makes them and counteract them. Moving faster than thought, Bart arrives to help his old friend. The speedster, sporting a new costume, proves too quick for Psimon and is able to punch him into submission.To celebrate, Impulse speeds ice cream cones into the hands of all the nearby citizens, including Superman.\nOut in the ocean, Clark and Bart race each other above the water. Bart comments on Clark running slower than he used to, which Clark attributes to now having the ability to fly as well. Clark makes a wager that he can fly faster than Bart can run with the loser paying for lunch. As the two rocket over the coast of Cameroon, a young woman watches from a distance.\nClark arrives in Mumbai, India, assuming that he has beaten Bart. As children swarm him for an autograph, he finds that Bart was not only there first but is playing a game of soccer with some of the locals. Later, as they share food, Clark describes how he can't return to his life as Clark Kent and must remain Superman for the time being due to Lex's irradiation ploy . Research from S.T.A.R. Labs has revealed that his healing ability from the rays of the sun is slowly curing the radiation. Bart suggests he fly into the sun to speed up the process and burn the rest of it away, but Clark tells him that Emil isn't sure they could stop the process from eventually turn him into raw energy if he tried it.\nWatchtower sends Impulse and Superman to deal with Monsieur Mallah and The Brain.\nThough he's happy to spend some time with Bart, Clark points out that it's not really the speedster's style and asks if something is wrong. Bart deflects by saying he had to get a glimpse of Clark in a costume . A moment of appreciation between the two is broken up by a call from Chloe at Watchtower . She tells them that a situation with art thieves in Paris has arisen and, as they don't have any agents in Europe as of yet, they are the two closest to respond. They make another wager over who can get there first. Bart gives Clark a head start and his friend bolts into the sky. As he prepares to run, Bart hears an ominous voice call his name. He looks around but sees nothing but the locals. Tapping into the Speed Force , he runs after the Man of Steel.At the Musée du Louvre in Paris, Superman and Impulse arrive to help the French police with a chaotic scene, baffled at the threat art thieves are presenting. Suddenly, a huge explosion racks the front of the museum. Out of the rubble runs Monsieur Mallah , a giant gorilla carrying the Mona Lisa. In a container slung around Mallah's back is the brain of the scientist who increased Mallah's intelligence to genius levels. The two lead a gang of monkeys and apes stealing art.\nAs Impulse attends to the smaller primates, Superman turns his attention to Mallah and the Brain . The Brain can speak through the container and Superman asks if he is Mallah's. Brain explains that they are lovers and helped each other escape from the experimentation that led to their current states. They plan to sell the stolen art to fund and form their own nation. Mallah pulls a gun and fires at the crowd.\nImpulse runs to catch some of the bullets but sees there are too many. He taps into the Speed Force to move faster and is able to stop all of the projectiles. Using the Force, though, brings on the mysterious voice again. In Speed Time, Bart sees a horrifying dark creature run out of the Force that he's seen before, telling him that \"It is time.\" The creature bolts toward Bart, reaching out to grab him.\nMeanwhile, Superman uppercuts Mallah off of his feet, knocking him out. He turns to find the other monkeys and apes massing toward him. Winding his arms up and bringing his hands together in a superclap, Clark uses the force and the sound of the clap to upend all of the primates and knock them unconscious.\nClark finds a tired and scared Bart on his knees, muttering that \"it\" almost got him. Looking around the scene, Clark asks what Bart is talking about. Realizing the creature is nowhere to be found—and wanting to keep the secret to himself—Bart tells his friend it was nothing.\nClark and Bart discuss the creature that haunts Bart.\nFlying over the Atlantic, Clark carries Bart, who told him about the creature, refusing to let him use superspeed to avoid being captured by it in the Speed Force. Bart then mentions the \"Speed Demon\" or \"Black Racer\" has always waited for him at every turn when he used his superspeed, after which he explains in detail what really happened years ago during the time he was captured by Lex. With the creature always present ever since, Clark asks why Bart wanted a race to India in the first place. Bart admits that, since Clark is the only one who can come close to keeping pace with him, he hoped that by the two going so fast and Clark not seeing the demon, he could prove it was all in his head. Clark assures his friend that he's not crazy. He states that they need to find a way for Clark to face the creature and make it stop tormenting Bart once and for all.\nClark trying to find out what's after Bart.\nAt S.T.A.R. Labs , Emil Hamilton meets with his staff to discuss two problems before them: one, assisting Superman in finding a way to help Impulse with the dark creature; and two, aiding Watchtower in retrieving the technology that LexCorp used to transfer Hank Henshaw 's consciousness from his charred and crippled body into one of the H.E.D. drones. Emil states he will address the technology issue and assigns the others to Impulse's case.The scientists at S.T.A.R. Labs set Bart and Clark up for a speed assessment. As Bart chats up a lovely blonde scientist , Emil asks Clark how he's able to be so jovial. Clark answers that Bart probably welcomes any distraction from being chased by the creature as long as he has. With everything set, Bart wonders how Clark will manage to match his speed, considering he runs a lot faster than Clark. Emil explains that the treadmills they are using for the assessment had been specially designed with a frictionless engine assembly when they began testing Clark's abilities. This will allow Bart to run as fast as he can while Clark's treadmill will accelerate him towards Bart's speed. They all hope that if they can get Clark fast enough, he can witness the creature as well.\nClark faces the Black Flash for the first time.\nAs they run, Clark encourages Bart to go full speed, insisting that he has his friend's back. With approval, Bart taps into the Speed Force and runs so fast that he causes the treadmill and the monitoring equipment to explode. As Clark falls to the floor, while in the Speed Force, the horrible creature towers over him, chastising his speed as \"not pure.\" Outside of the force, Bart asks Clark if he was able to see the demon. Now knowing what he is dealing with, Clark assures his friend that he will find a way to save him.\nClark and Lois discussing Bart's problem.\nClark and Lois meet on the roof of the Daily Planet Building for a bite to eat and further lament that he can't return to his \"normal\" life as a mild-mannered reporter. She mentions that he has burned through all of his sick days and vacation time and that their boss, Franklin Stern , is getting suspicious about his absence. Joking about having to tell him Clark's become a fireman or something else, Clark admits that he's devoted his life to bigger things now.\nRegarding one of those things, Lois shows Clark pictures of the LexCorp employee, Fritz, who was thrown into a wall and superspeed aged to death at the ruins of LuthorCorp 's abandoned Ridge Facility . She shows him pictures of other incidents of it occurring over the past five years. She says that these \"speed storms\" have popped up in Keystone City , Mexico, Miami, and islands in the Pacific Ocean, and have been increasing in frequency. Clark immediately recognizes each as places Bart has been and that the storms are chasing him like the dark creature. Clark worries that he won't be able to find a way to help Bart when Lois points out that he should consult someone else who has run as fast as Bart before.\nClark and Bart at the Brownstone Museum.\nThey are interrupted by Jeff and Clark superspeeds into the sky. Later, Clark and Bart visit the JSA Brownstone , being tended to by a Mrs. Hunkel . She lets them past the security measures and Clark takes Bart into the museum honoring the members of the Justice Society of America . Bart recalls that this was Carter Hall 's group but wonders how any of the artifacts will help them with his problem with the \"speed demon.\" Clark explains they are there to begin a search for the first hero to break the sound barrier on foot, Jay Garrick .\nOn the soccer field in Mumbai where Bart played with the kids earlier, one of the speed storms breaks out. Another hits at Louvre in France. Chloe and Oliver monitor the outbreaks at Watchtower and note the increasing frequency. Oliver relays this to Clark while Clark asks how Chloe is doing following her procedure. Oliver assures him that he's looking after her.\nClark and Bart walk the white plains of Utah until they come upon an isolated house. An old voice asks if he can help them and Bart reveals they are looking for Jay Garrick. The man at the end of the voice steps from the house and identifies himself as Garrick.\nAt Garrick's house, the old man chastises Bart for  stealing his identity . He asks him he did it and Bart admits that he doesn't know. He also reveals that he doesn't remember anything of his life previous to waking up with his abilities, just that there was a flash of light and the names of Garrick,  Wally West , and  Barry Allen  just appeared in his head. Clark explains to Garrick the plan  Carter Hall  had of resurrecting the  Justice Society of America  with the help of the new, younger heroes. He asks for the elder's help.\nBart explains his origin to Clark and Jay Garrick.\nGarrick suggests Bart talk to his old teammate,  Pieter Cross , instead. Impatient, Bart asks what the old man knows about the \" Black Racer .\" The elder speedster tells them his leg was broken when the federal government tried rounding up the JSA and he never wanted it repaired. When Clark attempts to ask why he would never want to run fast again, Bart correctly guesses that he's seen the demon. Garrick admits to it and explains that what is occurring to Bart happened to him. Clark mentions the speed storms and Garrick says it's the racer calling Bart out. Bart asks how the old man survived it and Garrick reiterates that he just stopped running.

Clark asks why there were no records of speed storms while Garrick was with the JSA. The old man surmises that Bart is so fast that it has made the creature hungry and desperate.

Chancellor also explains to Superman a bit about their religion, how proud enlightened people they are and that their war is more about that despite the violence. He also reveals that the main cause of the war is to recover the body of their God.

The Kryptonians actually want to recover Faora's body, whom they worship as their Goddess because of her tale that was told by Argo's settlers and eventually became myth. They believe that her body holds the key of unlocking their future as a people and that is why they sent Kara as a spy to locate the coordinates of Faora's tomb, but without her actually know what she is looking for.\nOver the Amazon forest, Clark and Kara are discussing Kara's decision to become a spy for the Kryptonians and how she doesn't like it anymore feeling she had been taken advantage of.

When they enter the room they see a huge structure, resembling a palace which was built by Zod, and Kara wonders why Zod buried Faora there. Clark tells her that the original Zod and Faora couldn't have children so when his clone found out that Faora's clone, who had already killed, was actually pregnant with his child, he immediately regretted his action and fell into depression and that is why he built this place, to honnor her. Clark also says that he made a throne for himself, to seat after he had conquered the Earth, in the center of the structure facing a pit where he had kept Faora's dead body frozen inside a crystalline cube. Then Kara asks again why he put the throne facing the pit and Clark assumes that that he did it because of guilt. After that Clark and Kara fly down the pit and visit Faora's body where Clark explains that the Kryptonians believe that her child was a sacred thing, because as they believe that it may have been the answer on why the Kryptonians had powers under yellow sun and not red. Kara then states that the Kryptonians won't be the first to know the answer.\nKara fights Clark.\nIn the Amazon forest, outside Faora's tomb, Clark and Kara are discussing about the war.

Clark seems surprised and Kara asks about Doomsday so Cosmic Boy explains to her that it was a monster that Clark defeated some years ago. Brainiac 5 says that it is possible Earthgov did not authorize the attack on New Krypton, or, if they did, maybe Kirt Niedrigh wasn't actually clear to his superiors about what he found beneath old Metropolis. Kara then asks from Clark to go to New Krypton because he has the experience to defeat the beast, due to his last encounter with Doomsday. Kara calls all the Legion members to follow her to Earth, except from Saturn Girl, who follows Clark on New Krypton.\nSuperman vs. Doomsday.\nOn New Krypton, Superman and Saturn Girl find Doomsday, the hulking brute having almost killed off the Eradicators and caused mass panic in the city. Clark asks Imra to make a link with the minds of all the Kryptonians. Clark then informs them about who he is and Doomsday's origin. He also encourages them to help him defeat the beast. Unfortunately, Clark and the other Kryptonians' efforts are not enough to stop Doomsday so Clark decides to take the monster and throw it to the sun. Cancellor Pa-Vel says to Clark that he isn't powerful enough to escape the sun's gravity, and Clark responds that he is aware of that.\nSuperman pushing Doomsday into the heart of the sun.\nMeanwhile deep in space Superman engages Doomsday flying him directly into the Sun while telepathically communicating with Saturn Girl, whom he tells her certain instructions as he doesn't believe he'll make it out alive.

At the airport, Clark says he could simply fly them to Washington instead of taking a plane to get there but Lois says that if someone spots Superman in Washington and finds out that there is no evidence of how Clark Kent, who surprisingly is also there, flew into town, it could possibly blow his cover off, in which Clark agrees.

Martha tells him that he is already doing very well into inspiring hope. Clark says it's time to inspire change too. Martha then says if he feels in his heart that it is the right thing to do, then he already has his answer.\nClark repairs the Washington Monument.\nLater, Superman repairs the Washington Monument in front of thousands of people who admire him, and after changing to his civilian persona he goes to find Lois, who is very proud of him, in the crowd. They both know that tomorrow the Earth will be a different place, so they savor these moments by kissing.\nClark tells Conner about his decision.\nLater, Superman visits Conner Kent and tells him that Jay told him he was proud for him. Superman also says they are lucky they had people like Jay in their lives. Conner also says that he might visit Rose in Alcatraz because he wants her to know that just because her father was a tool, it doesn't mean she has to be one too and Clark says he believes he and his team of Titans are going to be fine. Conner then asks Clark why he came to visit him and Clark says he is going to have a very important conversation with the President. Conner asks what this has to do with him and Clark says it is going to change the way people look at that \"S\" on his chest.\nSuperman reveals to the President that he is an alien.\nThe same night, Superman visits the White House to meet with President Martinez. He apologizes for waking him up but he says that they need to talk. The President thanks him for saving his life and then properly introduces himself saying that he can call him \"Thomas\" to which Superman replies that he can call him \"Kal-El\", of Krypton and he's an alien.\nSuperman receives a message of encouragement from Lois.\nSuperman goes back to work.\nFlying in space above Earth, Superman remembers his father's advice while listening to the world talk about his recent confession of being an alien. There is mistrust and fear of him, but Superman knew the risk he was taking. While trying to remember the three phrases his father told him, Lois sends him the third phrase in a text message, showing him she is there for him. Suddenly Clark hears a bullet train in Japan that cannot be stopped so he goes back to work. Inside the train there is a small boy, named Hiro Okamura , who is playing with his robots and toys when suddenly the train runs at full speed to a fatal accident. Tess, who observes the situation and supports Superman from the Watchtower, informs \"Boy Scout\" of a fluctuation in Earth's magnetic pole that has destabilized the train's track system but still she does not know what caused it.\nSuperman stops the train.\nFortunately Superman succeeds in saving the train, slowing it down and no one gets hurt, but then nervous people start to question him about his origin and if there are more aliens like him, that they should be afraid of. Hiro seems to run away from the train, as if he is afraid of Superman, who just tries to explain that he needed the Earth to know that not everything out there is a threat.\nSuperman visits the White House once again.\nThe U.S. president summons Superman to a meeting at the Oval Office, where he shows to him some photos of someone who fell in Russia in recent meteor shower. Superman recognizes the person as a \"Monitor\" and when the President asks him what is a \"Monitor\", Superman responds to him by saying that he will know as soon as he does. Superman then promises he will investigate the matter, and that is something that everyone should be concerned.\nClark discusses the Monitors with the team.\nAt Watchtower, Chloe, Tess, Clark and Lois discuss about Earth-2, which was presumably annihilated by the Monitors, and Clark wonders what crime could that Earth have committed to deserve to merit annihilation. Chloe says everything she knows about the alternate Earth and the Monitors but also informs them that the memories, that were transported to her from her doppelgänger never actually took root and she only gets fleeting glimpses. Tess informs them that Lex is preparing his jet to visit Moscow and Lois thinks of a way to sneak in as a press attaché and go to Russia with Lex so she can keep an eye on him. Clark then says he has a better idea and the proceeds to communicate with another member of the team, asking for a favour.\nClark joins Lex and Otis in their travel to Moscow.\nBoarding the plane, Otis tells his boss that he has invited the press to chronicle his \"greatness\", much to Lex's annoyance. They then watch as Superman fly over them with Lex seeing it as a challenge but Clark, who is inside the plane as a representative of the Daily Plane, says that it might be more of a reminder. Lex is obviously disappointed having Clark Kent accompanying him in his travel, saying that Lois Lane would be better company.\nLex is interviewed by Clark.\nInside Lex's jet, Clark interviews Lex about what he believes crashed in Russia and asks him why he is so interested on that and if it has something to do with his alleged attack at S.T.A.R. Labs. He then asks him about his rivalry with Superman but Lex responds by saying he doesn't trust Superman and in fact nobody should trust him, he also says he is glad the Earth is finally starting to sober up. Clark then says that Lex's amnesia is not a secret so he asks him if it has something to do with that and Lex says he is not sure but maybe his hatred for the superhero has something to do with his old life.\nClark and Lex talk about Lois' relationship with Superman.\nClark is ready to get into action.\nAfter that Lex starts to ask Clark about his relationship with Lois and why they haven't get married yet but Clark says they just haven't find the right moment yet. So Lex advises him not to wait too long, mentioning the amount of coverage Lois gives to Superman, indicating with that he might lose her to another man. Suddenly the jet gets into a big storm and because of a lightning they lose an engine so Clark prepares to take action but surprisingly someone else catches the jet from its fall. At first, Lex thinks that Superman might have saved them, something that makes him clearly irritated but it is revealed they were saved by a Russian team of superheroes, called the Rocket Red Brigade, who welcomes them in Moscow.\nClark Kent meets the Rocket Reds.\nClark interviews Alexi about how the Rocket Reds started.\nClark thanks the Rocket Red Brigade for saving them earlier and recognizes one of the team members as being one of the astronauts who was in the Guardian rocket months ago, Alexi. Alexi tells Clark that the government offered him the opportunity to form a team to fight against internal and external threats to Russia, all inspired by Superman, and in fact they already have prevented many meteorites from hitting the country. Alexi also reveals that the thing that fell the other day from the sky was not a meteorite but a man, which makes Clark ask if he thinks it seems right to keep the man captive. Alexi replies that his opinion is that if someone does not want to say why he is here, he does not hide anything good.\nLater, Clark arrives at the door of the premises where the Monitor is in, which is also the base of the Rocket Reds and he says goodbye to Alexi, who asks him to thank Superman from his behalf for saving his life. Suddenly the alarms of the facility are activated and Clark, removing his glasses, uses his X-ray vision to see what happens. The warning is fully justified as the Monitor called Ray-Lan has somehow been freed from his chains and makes a hole in the wall, killing a member of the Rocket Reds. Alexi says he does not want to hurt him, but Ray-Lan says he will have to.\nSuperman confronts for the first time the Monitor.\nSuperman and the Monitor fight.\nSuperman is shocked that the Monitor was able to hurt him.\nThe freed Monitor is killing soldiers on his way out of the facility. Lex asks him why he does that, and Ray-Lan responds that if he does not understand his purpose, he doesn't deserve to live so he proceeds to kill Lex too. Fortunately, Superman's timely intervention saves Luthor, and the fight between Superman and Ray-Lan begins. While fighting the Monitor mocks Superman's weakness and then Superman asks him what is the \"Crisis\", to which Ray-Lan is surprised that Superman doesn't know. Superman gives him a headbutt in the face and both contenders are separated by the blow. Ray-Lan, who lands on a building, succeeds to escape, while Lex wonders where he has gone, but Superman, seeing his own blood on his hands wonders how the Monitor could hurt him.\nSuperman after he healed himself thanks to the solar radiation.\nSuperman is badly injured after his fight with the Monitor.\nRay-Lan has just escaped from the facility in Moscow he was held captive thanks to the chaos he created and Superman, who is still sore, realizes he is bleeding because of the cut on his eyebrow. Ignoring Luthor who shouts at him to follow the Monitor, Superman flies above the clouds and the solar energy, which recharges him, heals him immediately. Then he communicates with Tess at Watchtower and tells her that now they have two priorities: to find out where the Monitor is hiding and how was Ray-Lan able to hurt him.\nSuperman changes back to his civillain disguise to find Lex.\nClark hears that  doesn't really care if something happens to Clark.\nSwitching back to his civillain disguise, Clark returns to the scene of conflict and reunites with Lex Luthor. Lex decides to go and find the Monitor on his own, whom he can trace through a device. Clark goes with him and when Lex thinks Clark can not hear him, he tells to Otis that he took Clark with him because he wouldn't mind if something happened to him.\nLex and Clark find the Monitor's ship.\nLater near in Russia, Clark and Lex have tracked the Monitor in the abandoned and radioactive city of Chernobyl. While searching the place they find there a hole in the ground that leads them to an underground level where a huge spaceship is hidden.\nClark and Lex discover several decimated parallel Earths.\nThe Monitor prepares to attack Clark and Lex.\nLex and Clark explore Monitor's spacecraft. Lex tells to Clark that the meteor shower that caused the accident of Karolyev (\"Guardian\") were the remains of a destroyed parallel Earth, and that suggests the existence of others. In fact, deep inside the spaceship, the two discover a glass tube-like structure that somehow contains several parallel earths that have already been decimated. But before they could react to the incredible view, the Monitor appears and tells them that their world has already far exceeded its useful life, and the two of them will not live to see its end.\nRay-Lan stalks Clark and Lex.\nMonitor's spaceship takes off.\nClark's identity is going to be exposed.\nBeneath Chernobyl, Clark and Lex try to escape from the Monitor, who is stalking them through his ship while revealing bits and pieces of his plan. Ray-Lan says that his fellow Monitors should be trying to prevent the inhabitants of the Earths they destroy from learning the truth about the fate of their world and Clark realizes that is why another Monitor killed Chloe Sullivan of Earth-2, when she set foot on this Earth. Eventually Lex and Clark manage to escape the ship, which fires its thrusts in preparation to take off. Clark takes advantage and flies himself and Lex out, timing his movements to make it look like they were thrown out by the blast. They land on a bridge, and the Monitor surprises them and shoots Clark in the chest, sending him flying through the air and into a frozen lake. Lex dives in after him and approaches the sinking body of an unconscious Clark, whose shirt has been ripped off by the hit of the Monitor, revealing his Superman costume.\nSuperman attacks Ray-Lan, saving Lex's life.\nClark is hit by Ray-Lan's beam.\nLex is diving into the frozen lake trying to reach Clark, but another shot coming from the Monitor hits Clark and makes him sink deeper in the water, making him unreachable. Luckily for Clark, Lex couldn't reach him and so he did not see his Superman costume inside the shreds of his civilian clothes.\nWhen Ray-Lan is ready to kill Lex, Superman appears and attacks the Monitor, throwing him far away in the forest. Because of his hypothermia, Lex has fainted and Superman lights a fire around him to warm his body. He then rises above the clouds to recharge himself with solar energy.\nSuperman recharges.\nSuperman breaks Ray-Lan's armor.\nWhile regaining his strength, Superman communicates with Emil and Tess at the Watchtower, who explain to him why they believe the Monitor can hurt him without the help of any kind of kryptonite or red solar radiation. They say that the Monitors are beings outside the laws governing their universe, their energy is not governed by the physical laws of our own, which also makes Superman vulnerable to their attacks. Emil tells Clark to seek help from Supergirl but he refuses because as he says if the Monitor can hurt him, he can hurt Kara too. Clark then descends and gets ready to face his enemy once again improvising.\nSuperman defeats Ray-Lan and proceeds to destroy his ship.\nSuperman flies directly into the beam of the ship.\nRay-Lan remotely controls his ship but Superman swoops down and destroys his arm cannon. Lex tells Superman to kill the Monitor or else his peers will keep coming. Superman tells him that's not his style and then flies directly into the beam of the ship, using it against itself and destroys it. As he falls, the ship causes a great explosion throwing shrapnel and fire. When Clark falls from the sky, wounded and blistered by passing through the beam of the ship, he sees Ray-Lan lying dead among the rubble, impaled by a metal rod on his chest. Regretfully, Superman apologizes and closes the corpse's eyes.\nClark visits Lex in the hospital.\nClark tells Lex that his ego is an obstacle on saving the Earth.\nLex wakes up in a bed in Metropolis General with Clark sitting in a chair beside him. Lex is shocked to see him alive, and Clark explains that Superman saved him from drowning and warmed his body in the same way he did with Lex's. Luthor apologizes for dragging him to Russia in his expedition, but Clark says he volunteered. Clark tells him the Monitor probably would've tried to destroy the planet with or without Lex's intervention. Clark starts to leave, when Lex tells him he's a good liar. Despite Clark's consoling words, Lex says he can see the disapproval in his eyes. And he suspects he saw that look in his \"past life,\" before he lost his memories. Clark acknowledges something of their history, saying that many times Lex's need to save the Earth often butted heads with his ego.\nClark worries about the upcoming \"Crisis\".\nClark welcomes Bruce in the League.\nLater in the Watchtower, Lois, Chloe, Clark and Tess read an article on the Daily Planet, titled \"The New Cold War\" and written by Cat Grant, presenting Superman as a threat and even stating that the Monitor's ship was actually his. Lois is furious with Cat's article and gets even more angry because of the fact that Franklin Stern didn't publish her story about the murder in Gotham. Clark says that they have bigger problems to worry about as the danger of the \"Crisis\" hasn't passed yet. Suddenly Bruce appears and says that even though he knew that the man in Gotham wasn't actually Clark he is happy to see him standing on his feet. Moreover he says that because of the \"Crisis\" he has decided to join the team, at least temporarily, so they can face the threat together.\nClark watches an unknown glowing green object coming towards him.\nClark is covered by the green light.\nClark becomes a Green Lantern.\nClark and Lois step out of the cinema, where they just watched a brand new superhero film. While they talk about the movie and the crisis, that still concerns Clark, a green light suddenly appears the sky. Seeing its trajectory and speed makes Clark worry for a possible attack. Clark can not tell what the object, wrapped in the green glow, is so he throws Lois on an abandoned old sofa in the street, when he realizes that the unknown object goes straight against him. Hit by the light, Clark is surrounded by green light and sees before him the projection of a being, who identifies himself as Tomar-Re . The alien says to Clark that if he is seeing him, it is because he has received his ring and his duty. Together they recite the oath of the Green Lanterns and when the light fades, Clark is revealed, wearing a green and black costume along with a glowing ring on his finger, which welcomes him to the Green Lantern Corps .\nClark tries to remove the ring from his finger.\nClark hears that he is needed somewhere else.\nClark tries using his heat vision and arctic breath in attempt to remove the ring while Lois is contacting Emil Hamilton at S.T.A.R. Labs for help. As Clark attempts to remove the ring, various constructs in the form of a jackhammer, a crowbar and a plunger appears which a confused Lois refers to as ghost props. A relieved Clark finally is able to remove it and throw it into the atmosphere where Emil begins to track it. As he does the ring makes a U-Turn back to Earth to Clark's finger which Clark flies to catch. Clark then hears a loud siren coming from Metropolis National Bank where he goes to intervene, telling Lois to inform Emil that they should worry about his wardrobe change later.\nClark can control his new found powers.\nClark flies away from the scene.\nAt Metropolis National, Dan Turpin and Maggie Sawyer as well as other members of the Metropolis police department are pinned behind the car wondering where Superman is at, to which they see him fly in his new Green Lantern uniform. Superman begins to use his heat vision warning the criminals to stand down. As he does the ring proceeds to create missile constructs of its own as a shocked Clark warn the criminals to watch out. As the criminals duck in shock, they proceed to fire their missiles. Clark and the police look on in shock as Superman attempts to get all the missiles, when all of a sudden the ring creates a giant Superman construct thus destroying the remain weaponry, causing the terrified bank crooks to flee surrendering to the police. Superman begins to apologize as he flies off in order to figure out how to properly control his ring. As he does he flies into John Stewart who tells Clark they need to talk.\nClark learns the origin of the Corps.\nAt Watchtower, Clark is discussing his new powers and the history of the Green Lantern Corps with a projection of Tomar-Re while Lois, Tess, and John watch. Tomar reveals he died in attempt to defend Krypton from destruction and now his ring, sector and duty is handed down to Clark which is mainly due to the return of the Kryptonian species the Argo colony. Clark tries to explain to Tomar that Earth is the home he has sworn to protect but Tomar tells him that his assigned sector is 2813. Clark then tells him that he knows for a fact that he doesn't suppose to interact with the citizens of New Krypton. He asks why not choose someone worthy from the Kandorian army?\nJohn Stewart tells Clark that he is a soldier now and has the duty to protect his sector.\nJohn tells Clark that this isn't how it works, the rings are powered by the willpower of their wearers, which is why in the past they chose people like himself, Kyle Rayner and Hal Jordan as Corps members. Lois and Tess disbelieve that John Stewart has a stronger will than them or any of the 6 billion people on Earth, with Tess even wondering how did someone like Alan Scott get hold of one of their rings, with John admitting he doesn't know what loophole Alan used to get a ring of his own. Clark then questions what gives a Guardian or whoever is left, the right to force other sentient beings into service. John retorts that orders are orders and Superman is a soldier now.\nClark is frustrated that he can't control his ring.\nClark asks John for answers.\nIn the Fortress, Clark tries to control the functions of his power ring but he finds it difficult. John, not being able to answer his questions, tells him to be patient, trust the Corps, as it is, like the Guardians, older even from Earth, and not question the rules. But Clark gets frustrated on carrying a weapon so powerful, without knowing how to use it, so he decides to visit \"the closest thing to an expert\" he knows.\nEmil explains to Clark and John how their rings function.\nAt S.T.A.R. Labs, John says he doesn't know a lot about his power ring even though he wears it for a decade. Emil explains that the ring enables the user to tap into power from beneath the fabric of reality and that the mind tells the ring how to filter and implement this power. Furthermore, the energy is traceable and acts as a locator. Suddenly, an employee of the lab says to Emil that a signal was detected similar to the one of the ring outside of the facility. John says he hasn't invited anyone from the Corps there, so he and Clark change back to their Lantern uniforms and go to check what is going on. Much to their surprise they find an army of Manhunters waiting outside.\nSuperman and John are being chased by the Manhunters.\nClark and John are under attack by the robots.\nSuperman destroys the group of Manhunters.\nSuperman and John try to contain the Manhunters' attack without putting in danger any civilian in Metropolis. Since they can not beat them, as their rings can't make a dent in them, Clark quickly decides to take the fight to a non populated area to avoid causing any casualties, so they fly to the Moon, where Justice League's new Watchtower base is still being built by S.T.A.R. Labs' drones. While fighting with them the two heroes hear the Manhunters saying that the Green Lanterns have violated a treaty, but Stewart says he has no idea what they're talking about. To aid Superman and Green Lantern in their battle, Tess takes under her control the drones and commands them to attack the Manhunters. During the battle, John realizes that the Manhunters are powered by yellow rings and that is why their rings can not work on them so he tells to Clark to fall back. Superman tells to Tess to stand down and then ends the battle with a powerful blast of heat vision destroying the remaining Manhunters. Clark asks John if this is the last of them and he says there's always more.\nClark meets the other Lanterns.\nOn the Moon, a group of Green Lanterns explain to Clark and John and that there is no treaty between the Guardians and the Manhunters, and one of them suggests that these Manhunters were rogue units that have gone mad without a purpose. Superman asks who created the yellow rings that powered the robots and the Lanterns explain that in order to battle the Manhunters, the Guardians took extreme measures, as the rings powered by the emerald energy of will were not enough, so they created the yellow rings, that are powered by fear. Unfortunately, the yellow light also drew something from the darkness, the ancient fear entity Parallax . After this revelation, the Lanterns decide to return to their sectors and report to their post. Before leaving, Salaak says something to John, requesting not to reveal it to the other Lanterns.\nClark and John find Parallax and the Guardians.\nTraveling to an unknown part of the galaxy, John still cannot believe what Salaak has told him, but suddenly he and Superman come face to face with Parallax. The entity says that he could feel John's fear from miles away. The two Lanterns see that Parallax has imprisoned the presumed dead Guardians and feeds from them. Parallax says that they offered themselves to him as part of a trade, a treaty, their fear as eternal fuel for his hunger for the power they siphoned from his domain with the promise of never hunting him again. Clark tells Parallax that the terms of the treaty haven't been violated but Parallax says the Lanterns are gathering to destroy it, with Clark being the newest member of the Corps as proof of it. Threatening Clark, Parallax says that the Guardians have lost their luster and the Manhunters have failed so he seeks to feed from the population of Earth. He starts vomiting yellow rings and sends them across the galaxy to find recruits for his own Corps.\nClark and John are captured by Parallax.\nClark goes back to Earth to protect it from the Yellow Lanterns.\nSuperman sends a distress signal while he returns to Earth.\nSuperman learns from Emil where the rings have landed.\nParallax has captured Clark and John and says that his yellow rings have arrived on Earth, by now, and his \"harvesters\" will provide him with the fear of the humans, so he can feast on it. One of the imprisoned Guardians, Ganthet, communicates telepathically with the two Lanterns and informs them that the other Guardians are keeping Parallax distracted, so he can tell them that in order to defeat Parallax, they should find something the beast fears. He has more to say, but he's unfortunately cut off by Parallax, who promptly tears him in two. Clark says that Ganthet bought them some time, by distracting Parallax, and they need to fall back. They both create a cage around the asteroid Parallax resides, preventing him of leaving it. John then says that Clark must return to Earth to stop these yellow rings, because the more fear they generate the stronger Parallax will become but Clark doesn't want to leave him behind. John says that he doesn't have a choice and that he will buy Clark some time in order for him to get back on Earth, so Clark wishes John good luck and leaves but while he is leaving, Parallax manages to break though the cage he has been held in, ready to face John.\nSuperman arrives at Arkham Asylum.\nSuperman sends a distress signal for all available Lanterns, informing them of the situation with Parallax and the yellow rings. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Emil Hamilton and his fellow scientists receive Clark's message and inform Superman the yellow rings have landed in Gotham City, specifically at Arkham Asylum.\nIn Gotham, Batman and Nightwing are doing their best to contain the newly powered inmates of Arkham have already been transformed into Yellow Lanterns . Luckily, Superman arrives just in time to offer assistance.\nSuperman tries  to stop the Yellow Lanterns.\nOn Earth, the team is monitoring the yellow rings and the subsequent mayhem they're causing. They communicate with Superman, who is fighting with the Yellow Lanterns in Gotham and tells them to focus on threats that are unrelated to the rings and let him deal with them because a situation like this is the perfect chance for other minor threats to go unnoticed.\nSuperman returns to his familiar colors.\nIn Arkham Asylum, Batman and Nightwing find it difficult to defeat the super-powered inmates. Superman tries to control the situation but his inexperience with his power ring doesn't help at all. Batman then tells him that the ring is not doing either of them any bit of good so Superman manages to break free of his Green Lantern armor and operate in his own suit once more, saying that he is more than just the ring. After this, all the Yellow Lanterns stand still and kneel before him. Superman is impressed and cannot believe that was all he had to do but he soon realizes that isn't the case. Parallax suddenly appears behind him, having John under his control.\nSuperman faces Parallax in John's body.\nSuperman tries to help John get control of his body.\nSuperman tries to convince John Stewart, who is possessed by Parallax, that it's okay to experience fear, that it's not an emotion anyone should repress or ignore. While trying to influence Parallax and help John get the control, Superman is also fighting the manifestations Parallax creates to attack him. Superman's words about a soldier having the right to ask questions seem to have an impact on John, who briefly takes control of his body, but surprisingly Parallax gets back in charge and makes John respond by impaling Superman with a sword constructed by his yellow ring, saying that he is going to murder his whole world.\nThe rings get rebooted and Superman gets his strength back.\nSuperman gets ready for the final fight.\nWatchtower informs Superman, who is pierced by a sword constructed of yellow energy, about their plan to reboot the rings, while Parallax leaves John's body intending to take over Superman's but he tells to his teammates to reset the rings. When they do the sword on Superman's chest disappears, he gets his strength back and all the Yellow Lanterns, including John, are released from the influence of fear and lose their powers with the rings turning black. Superman tells John, now he is free from Parallax, to get back up because they aren't done fighting yet.\nSuperman and the Lanterns watch as the entities battle.\nSuperman decides to intervene.\nSuperman encourages the Lanterns to choose their own destiny.\nAfter their rings get rebooted and they lose their powers, the inmates of Arkham fall from the sky unable to do anything to escape from their eventual death but fortunately Superman manages to save them all. Parallax is about to attack again but the real help comes when the other Green Lanterns arrive on the scene with the entity of willpower. The two entities begin to battle and with an assist from Superman, they banish Parallax to its realm, which was his greatest fear.\nClark reunites with Lois.\nLater, Stewart explains to Clark that the Corps will endure and from now on no one will be conscripted against his will. John also tells Clark that his ring will be returned to the colony, where the Kryptonians will elect which of them will become the new Green Lantern of Sector 2813 and no one will know Kal-El was the ring's first choice. After that, Clark is reunited with Lois, who asks his help to cover the latest breaking story: Green Arrow's return to crime-fighting.\nSuperman tries to contain the possessed Professor.\nSuperman fights with Bryce.\nIn Metropolis, Superman tries to contain Professor Bryce Gordon , who's been possessed by an evil spirit after he found a strange black diamond in Africa a few days ago, that has turned him into a violent monster. Tess informs him about the Professor and Superman tries not hurt him but he has to use force to battle him.\nSuperman leaves to rescue Lois.\nSuperman decides to end the fight by smashing the black diamond, shattering it to pieces. After that, the Professor gets back to normal but suddenly Superman hears Lois call for help and flies to Antarctica at super speed. He arrives in time to catch her just before the vortex pulls her in, but they're both caught in the rift just before it closes thanks to Michael Holt .\nClark and Lois try to figure out what happened and where they are.\nIn a parallel Earth, Superman and Lois emerge from the wormhole to find themselves in a destroyed Metropolis under siege by the Monitors. Superman takes Lois and they fly to a higher ground. Lois asks if they time-traveled but Clark says the rift they fell through was just like the one Chloe from Earth-2 crashed through. Clark then asks Lois why is she whispering and she says that this exactly the kind of place where you whisper, while also showing to him a man in a red and white costume, bound to the top of a building, similar to that of Daily Planet. Clark realizes they are lost in the Multiverse and Lois asks how are they going to return back but Clark says he doesn't know if they will, starring at the sky, which is full of the Monitors' ships.\nSuperman fights the Manhunters.\nSuperman and Lois are fighting some Manhunters, who are chasing them so they can kill them. After destroying some of them, Superman takes Lois and fly away escaping. Lois puzzles over why the Manhunters were hunting them given the fact that the Green Lanterns are their usual opponents but Clark says these robots were running on Bleed instead of Lantern energy, suggesting that the Monitors probably use them to deal with the \"supers\" and \"metas\" of each Earth while they move their ships into firing position. Lois then wonders where all the people of this Earth have gone and Clark after hearing some of them with his super-hearing heads to a church nearby.\nClark and Lois find the survivors of this Earth.\nSuperman asks the alternate Lois what happened on this Earth.\nSuperman battles with the Manhunters once again.\nThey enter the church and they find a group of people hiding in there and one of them, whom Clark identifies as the Jimmy Olsen of this Earth but in fact he is called Hank, tells them to immediately leave as according to him the \"capes\" are the reason most of the civilians are dead. Suddenly, the Lois Lane of this Earth appears among the people and tells Hank that they should let them stay because there is nowhere else they can go. A shocked Lois looks at her doppelganger while Superman asks her what happened. The alternate Lois says that she watched the Manhunters murder Mister Majestic, the superhero who was alternate Lois' lover and whose body was bound to the top of a building, along with every other hero. Superman then asks how did it started and alternate Lois explains that the Monitors put one ship on each side of the planet and they did something to Earth's core and it's only a matter of time until they destroy this Earth once and for all. Suddenly, the ships above Metropolis begin to fire and a worried Lois tells to Clark they need to get out of there immediately, in which he agrees.\nSuperman hears gunshots from the church.\nSuperman and Lois leave in search for the Fortress of Solitude.\nSuperman is fighting with the Manhunters, preventing them from attacking the refugees. The Manhunters suddenly evacuate in preparation for the \"purge,\" and Superman hears gunshots in the church. He returns and finds everyone but Lois dead, all as a result of self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Not being able to do anything more, Superman takes a shocked Lois and fly away, telling her this Earth also had a Kryptonian, in the form of Mister Majestic, and there is chance that his father built him an ice castle too. They then set off in search of this earth's equivalent of the Fortress of Solitude, as it is their only option.\nSuperman and Lois try to stay alive.\nClark watches the destruction of Earth-Majestic.\nClark and Lois arrive at the Fortress.\nSuperman flies with Lois, trying to escape the Bleed that is destroying everything in its path. Superman hopes that the Fortress can send them back to their Earth like it did with Clark Luthor. They reach the Fortress of Solitude, but this world's Jor-El is less than welcoming as he does not recognize Superman as his son, calling him an impostor, because he knows that he is already dead. Jor-El then locks Superman inside a golden crystal and Lois steps forward trying to reason with him, saying that he is making a mistake. Jor-El is surprised and asks her who is she who dares to question him and she says that she is Lois Lane.\nClark and Lois moments before the transportation to another Earth.\nWhile Superman is imprisoned inside the golden crystal, the huge wave of Bleed approaches the Fortress, devouring everything in its path. After arguing with him, Lois manages to convince Jor-El to release Superman and help them travel to another parallel world. Jor-El tells to Lois everything he knows about the multiverse but he says he can not guarantee them they are going to end up back at their Earth and also asks her if she can take him with them as well. Lois says that they will take their chances in order to survive and then agrees to take Jor-El with them. Jor-El then downloads his consciousness in a crystal and teleports everyone somewhere else, moments before this Earth gets devoured by the Bleed.\nClark and Lois on another parallel Earth.\nSuperman and Lois, along with Jor-El's crystal, wake up on another parallel Earth, that's not in much better shape than the one they just left. This earth was attacked and seized by Apokolips and the two planets have collided with each other, leaving everything destroyed with wrecked Manhunters and skeletons of dead people with the Omega symbol on their forehead on the streets among the ruins.\nClark and Jor-El talk about the Bleed and the multiverse.\nClark comforts Lois about the fate of their home.\nClark hears a faint sound and goes in search for its source.\nSuperman talks with Jor-El, from the previous Earth they visited, in an effort to understand the bleed technology and the multiverse. Jor-El explains that Kryptonian scientists found the means of traveling through space via wormholes and accidentally stumbled unto the bleed technology which proved to be erratic and highly unstable as it appear to destroy whatever it came in contact with. Superman informs Jor-El that the Monitors somehow managed to harness the bleed and use it as means to travel to parallel worlds and destroy them. However, Earth-Omega wasn't destroyed by the Monitors; it was destroyed by something else. Upon returning to Lois, who has found a ship that might be still working, they have a brief moment of weakness in which Lois admits to him that seeing the amount of devastation upon these worlds caused by the Monitors, is almost too much to bear and she's worried about their own Earth. Superman reassures her he would do whatever it takes to insure that their Earth won't suffer the same fate. Suddenly Superman hears a very faint sound, similar to a heartbeat so together with Lois they head towards its source to find out what exactly it is.\nLois and Superman encounter an unexpected foe.\nSuperman and Lois eventually discover the source of the noise Clark heard. A dark figure calls to him from the rubble, saying on his Earth, Superman was known as Clark Kent. When Superman asks the figure how he know this, the figure turns and says they have fought each other in the past on Clark's native universe, and indicates that Superman had defeated him. The figure then reveals himself as Darkseid in his materialized form, saying that he never forgets a face.\nSuperman makes a deal with Darkseid.\nSuperman and Lois enter the ship.\nSuperman and Lois talk to Darkseid. The ruler of Apokolips tells them that there isn't any other version of him in the multiverse, as there is only one Darkseid and until recently, he traveled to many universes to bring death and destruction. He also mentions the only reason Superman achieved to defeat him before was because he hadn't reached his full strength at the time. However, the Monitors succeeded to broke him, when he had already conquered this world. Superman then offers a deal to Darkseid, to help them board on one of the Monitors' ships flying overhead, and in return Clark will also give him something. Darkseid accepts the offer so, while Superman carries Lois and follows the Monitors' ship into the atmosphere, he fires his Omega beams towards the ship, opening its side door so Superman and Lois can get inside it just before the ship enters the Bleed. Once inside, they lay low while Monitors investigate the duo's forced entry, unaware that stowaways have entered the ship and fearing of Bleed contamination. They then proceed to go in search of a room called the \"Orrery\". Lois is concerned about the deal they made with Darkseid but Clark says he couldn't leave her behind.\nSuperman is render unconscious by a blast of Bleed.\nSuperman and Lois watch in horror as Lex suggests to The Monitors to re-make their universe.\nIn Bleed space, Superman and Lois search for their Earth among a large number of dead ones. Lois places her hand in a machine that recognizes in which one she belongs and they find out that their home is still unharmed. Suddenly a Monitor appears, calling himself a Weaver, who has been trained since birth to manipulate the Bleed as a weapon, and declares that he is going to kill them like Superman killed one of their architects, Ray-Lan. Superman says to Lois he will try to make the Weaver hurt himself, as the Bleed can probably hurt him too. Just then, three more Weavers appear and they say that no one else from the multiple Earths has ever get aboard a Monitor's ship. Together, they render Superman unconscious. After Superman loses his senses and the Monitors take both him and Lois to a holding cell, until the Council decides their fate. After that, Superman wakes up and they suddenly start hearing a very familiar voice. That voice belongs to Lex Luthor, who suggests the Monitors, rather than razing his universe, simply \"reboot\" it.\nThe Monitors sentence Superman to death.\nSuperman is expelled into the Bleed.\nSuperman fights his way back into the ship.\nThe Monitors listen to Lex's proposal to reboot the universe. Superman interrupts his proposal, saying that what he is proposing is madness. Lex is surprised to see that Superman and Lois are still alive, as he was wondering where have they ended up. Lois calls him a monster but Lex insists he's the only one actually trying to save the world by reasoning with the Monitors. The Monitors end the transmission, saying they have much to discuss. Lois is shocked when she learns that the Monitors are actually going to consider Lex's offer. The Monitors then recognize Superman as the person who killed Ray-Lan, so they decide to sentence both of them to death so they won't be able to interfere again in their plans. They intend to kill Superman and Lois by jettisoning them into the Bleed, as no one can survive it, not even the Monitors. Superman says he can get them out of this situation, but Lois will have to trust him and let the Monitors kill him first.\nA wounded Superman enters the ship and goes to find Lois.\nClark gets into the lifeboat with Lois.\nSuperman allows himself to be put into a chamber, which the Monitors flood with Bleed. A tearful Lois watches him being expelled from the Monitors' vessel. However, despite the rigors of Bleed Space, Superman manages to return to the ship and force his way back in. He reenters just as Lois is about to be expelled from the ship as well.\nLois gets aboard a lifeboat and escapes from the Monitors' ship but just before she leaves a wounded Superman appears and gets away with her. As they travel through the Bleed space they see an Earth, that feels like home. They return to their home universe and crash land in Tibet, where Lois holds an unconscious Clark in her arms, calling for help, but they're alone.\nClark wakes up healed.\nClark is ready to save the world.\nOn the other side of the globe Clark wakes up fully healed but with a shredded costume, while some helps nurse him back to health marveling on how the sun healed him so fast. As he thanks the man, he overhears Lois calling the Watchtower, Tess Mercer informs them of the crisis in motion with cities around the world are all being affected, and Washington D.C., where Martha Kent as well as General Sam Lane are stationed, was hit first just like on the other Earth. Lois is worried that they are too late to stop it. Clark is optimistic and holding Lois, saying their is still a chance to stop this soaring telling her it is time to go 'Up, up and away'.\nClark and Lois try to escape the blue Bleed.\nAcross the Atlantic Ocean, Clark and Lois are almost home, watching the Monitors rebooting the universe which Lex convinced them to do as they break the water and air down to base elements and collecting it as they prepare to reassemble it, realizing Lex may have bought them some time to stop this. Clark wonders if Lois is ready to see this but Lois rationalize since they are possibly one of the last journalists, they have no choice. Lois wonders if her dad and his mom, along with everyone else in D.C. being vaporized is better than being terminated, Superman says he doesn't plan on finding out and would only take time to grieve if they can't save the day. However he tells tells her they need to focus because one of the ships releases a group of Manhunters on them.\nClark asks the team to learn as more as they can about the Crisis.\nSuperman and Lois finally arrive at Watchtower where Tess Mercer, Chloe and Oliver along with Batman, Nightwing Martian Manhunter, Supergirl, Jay Garrick and his team of teenagers. Clark tells Chloe, Tess and Bruce to find out everything from one of the Manhunters he destroyed about the Crisis, because more ships are on their way. As Batman starts to examine the crumpled Manhunter head he wonders where are they going, Clark grimly says everywhere.\nClark wants no causalities in their upcoming war.\nBruce and Clark sit in the Kents' apartment to figure out a game plan. Bruce is angered when he finds out about Lex Luthor's machinations but he distracts himself by revealing what he has extracted from the Manhunter head. Bruce points out that the Manhunters can be hurt but the Crisis is not something Superman can just punch away. Clark asks Bruce if they will be able to stop the crisis without either side having any casualties but Bruce remains uncomfortably silent. He then says to Clark to put on another pot of coffee.\nClark gets ready for war.\nClark gathers the team.\nSoon Clark gathers all of the heroes onto his rooftop and gives them the lowdown. They can distract the Manhunters with physical attacks while Watchtower leads an evacuation to the heartland. If the distraction they provide fails everyone will die or be 'rebooted', but if they win everything will stay as it was and how they all remember the world. Clark tells them to say goodbye to their loved ones and suit up ready for war.\nLois and Clark discuss the team's plan.\nIn Watchtower, Lois Lane has enlisted for the team's mission and is having a heart to heart with Clark before gearing up and discussing the plan. Lois explains that while the superheroes will fight the Manhunters, she will sneak inside the Monitors' ship and upload a virus that would get the control of their networking systems. Clark then reveals he has to turn to the only human on Earth capable of helping their plan succeed and that is Lex Luthor.\nThe two men agree to work together.\nSuperman meets Lex Luthor.\nConfronting Lex he makes a correct assumption that Luthor had quietly mapped the Monitor and Manhunter systems during his machinations with them. Lex is impressed with Superman's intelligence and points out he has done just that. Due to his dealings, instead of a Red bleed his organizing a reshuffling Blue bleed has bought them time and that Superman has to agree to a temporary truce in order for everyone on Earth to succeed. The two men then shake hands, with Lex revealing he knows that if Lois is harmed it will likely mean his undoing either from the reboot or at Superman's hands.\nThe heroes help Lois and Lex get inside the ship.\nSuperman delivers a rousing speech to the heroes. The other Earths might have been erased or rebooted but they are determined for their Earth to survive and their continuity to continue. With that Superman, Luthor and all of Earth's heroes attack the incoming Manhunters.\nThe plan goes into overdrive and the attack is immediately full on. They may be on a zero fatality mission but the Manhunters are not and Superman makes it clear if they are hit, they die. The powerhouses are stuck with their specific missions, Superman and Supergirl are clearing a path for Lois and Lex.\nSuperman helps Lex escape.\nPods land in Metropolis releasing Monitors as all the older heroes form an army to fight them, Superman arrives with Lois and asks Tess if their backup plan worked. Tess confirms that a second virus was planted in Lex Luthor's battlesuit. As a hull rips open Superman is there to aid his escape and Lex is relieved that at least they are honorable.\nSuperman, Supergirl and Martian Manhunter try to hold the pod.\nSuperman spots the pod approaching Earth, feelings of sheer horror aside, he, Kara and J'onn try to stop the pod from hitting its target. Even with their combined might the pod overcomes them and speeds beyond them breaking the sound barrier.\nAll the heroes race to the Watchtower but are too late to stop the destruction as the pod crashes into the side and it begins to crumble to dust. A tearful Clark pours on the speed as Ollie cries out. Superman is shocked to see a red tornado explode from the rubble landing Chloe safely on the ground. John and Aya protect everyone with an emerald bubble shield as Superman approaches with a devastated Ollie but as the dust clears Chloe is unharmed and joined by Tess (In her new Red Tornado form). Lois and Ollie hug Chloe while Tess takes Superman aside to explain how she manufactured her new android body also telling Superman about how the Monitors had sent the pod to deliberately sever the virus they had and the link to their network. Superman asks Tess what was in the pod just as something smashes its way out of the rubble. Clark utters some rousing words as the heroes swear to fight together now and forever against this threat.\nBatman is proving a weak link in the fight with the Monitor warriors. Clark tells him to fall back, get Lois and Chloe to safety and try to re-establish the link to the Monitors' ship.\nWith might of astounding levels Clark soars upwards then smashes the warrior to a wheezing wreck. Clark tells him to pass a message on to his masters than no more blood will be shed. The Omega Monitor launches a series of cables that capture Superman. The warrior points out that if Superman is broken then the will of his 'Justice League' will too. Instead of passing the message Superman instructed the Omega Monitor orders the orbiting ship to triangulate his position and fire with all their might. Clark cries out refusing to be rebooted but the Omega Monitor laughs wheezily that he no longer has a choice.\nSuperman fights the Blue Bleed.\nSuperman, meanwhile is in trouble as he becomes a phantom watching events of his life play backwards. As he is tormented by this Arrow, Wonder Woman, and Supergirl arrive to see him reflect the reboot energy back at the craft it came from. Superman's counter attack disrupts their network long enough for Tess to reconect. Superman orders Tess to control the ships to fire on everything except the collector and reconstruction ships.\nThe Justice League decides on the Monitor's fate.\nThe League stands in the Fortress standing judgment over the female Monitor. The universe is now back to normal though all that died is still dead. The female Monitor asks to die but J'onn points out that Clark would never kill anyone. The League then decides to send the Monitor to the Phantom Zone. Arrow asks Clark what they do now the threat is over, Clark smiles and tells him that we should, endure, survive and live our lives and with that though on their minds they all race off.\nThe Justice League members are finally recognized as heroes.\nThree weeks later LexCorp holds a major press confrence and Lex introduces the public to a new monument built on the former Watchtower site. In a massive turnout Lex publicly admits that if it weren't for the heroes of earth the universe would be lost. Then Superman makes a speech that is broadcast all over the world. As the tarp falls away it reveals a stunning bronze statue of the Justice League.\nAs Lois helps Clark move out of the Bullpen into his new office the two receive simultaneous text messages and race out arm in arm at super speed. And so we arrive at hospital just after the birth of Chloe and Ollie's baby. Ollie of course gifting the young boy with a baby sized bow.\nThe Justice League welcomes a new family member.\nLois and Clark are shocked to be named God Parents and coo over the new addition. Clark remembering the losses they have suffered over the years is truly touched to meet a new life brought into the fold and even more so when they reveal the baby's name to be Jonathan.\nClark and Lois share a kiss.\nThis is a job for Superman.\nLater Lois and Clark sharing a bath look back at their recent achievements and look forward to a little downtime. Lois jumps out of the bath straight into a jumpsuit strapping on a parachute as Clark suits up in his costume. The two fly out into the night directly in front of a full moon embracing, soaring through the sky.\nTess radios in to 'Boy Scout' about a tsunami in India so Lois dashes landward with her parachute leaving Clark to do his thing. Tess tells Clark that he has only three minutes to stop the disaster but he has one request - no more 'Boy Scout' as a codename, saying that this looks like a job for Superman.\nClark's Vision\nSee: Clark Kent\nChaos (Earth-Majestic)\nMister Majestic was his world's greatest superhero until the Monitors came to destroy it. The Manhunters , who are running on Bleed and serve the Monitors, arrived on Earth and murdered all of its heroes along with Majestic, in front of the eyes of his lover,  Lois Lane . After his death, his corpse was hanged on top of a building. He also had a Fortress of Solitude as well as an artificial intelligence with the consciousness of his biological father, who after Majestic's death was grieving for the loss of his son.\nIn the Comics\nNew 52 Clark Kent from baby to Superman.\nSuperman was the original superhero, innovating the genre with his first appearance in Action Comics #1 in 1938. Although the creators of Smallville keep the spirit of the character intact, there are notable differences between the character depicted on Smallville, and the character as he appears in the source material.\nThroughout the Silver Age of comics from the late 1950's through the mid-1970's, Clark began his super-hero career as a teenager going by the identity of Superboy, along with his animal sidekick Krypto the Superdog. Clark would have many adventures both solo and with the Legion of Super-Heroes , until graduating high school and moving to Metropolis. However, following the events of 1985's Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover event in the Modern Age of comics, this history was wiped clean in favor of a new version of the origin, 1986's The Man of Steel, by writer/artist John Byrne. This story would form the origin of the character for nearly 20 years.\nSuperman's costume in the comics during the New 52 era.\nIn most versions of Superman's origin , Clark Kent leaves Smallville immediately after completing high school, and goes to college in Metropolis before spending time traveling the world. After a year or so of traveling, Superman arrives in Metropolis with the created persona of Clark Kent (bumbling, with glasses) in his mid-twenties as a reporter for the Daily Planet . The relationship with Lana Lang has no melodramatic hardships, Lex Luthor and Clark were only friends for a short while, and Clark did not meet members of his future rogues' gallery (such as Brainiac or Toyman ) or his future allies until after he established himself as Superman. In a major contrast with the show, Clark is often depicted in the comics as gaining the ability of flight as an adolescent while still living in Smallville, well before he completed high school.\nSuperman as he appeared in publication before the Relaunch.\nSuperman's character has seen dramatic changes based on different eras of the comics. Clark's adoptive human father, Jonathan Kent , is shown both dying before Clark's emergence as Superman, as well as staying alive as a supporting character. Most media adaptations of the character (save for Lois & Clark , Ruby Spears' Superman and Superman: The Animated Series ) favor the death of Jonathan. Jonathan Kent recently died in Action Comics at the conclusion of Geoff Johns and Gary Frank 's Brainiac story arc, as Pa Kent suffers a fatal heart attack after saving his wife from an onslaught by Brainiac.\nClark's Family (Lois & Jon)\nAfter the onset of the \"New 52\" in 2011, Clark loses both of his adoptive parents before becoming Superman. Said version of Superman, however, been dropped after the relaunch of \"Rebirth\" and brought back to normal, in favor of his previous incarnation (The Post-Crisis one.) In the process both he and Lois are bestowed a precious gift with a child of their own whom they name Jonathan Samuel Kent after his own father and Lois', Jon has recently learned of his true lingage and that his kryptonian powers are emerging as he get's older now currently in his eight age, he's taking up the cape himself under the handle of Superboy under the watchful eye of his parents.\nSuperman's current costume after the relaunch.\nAlso, based on different eras and interpretations, the source material usually shows either Clark Kent or Superman as the dominant personality. The modern comics favor Clark Kent as the main identity, who created the Superman persona as a way to be free of worry in regards to his friends and family, as well as to maintain some facets of a \"normal life.\"\nA Smallville reference in the background in Superman/Batman #73.\nIn most comics and cartoons, unlike Smallville, the idea of a superhero team (such as the Justice League of America ) was originally Superman's. He felt that most of the Earth's problems could be handled best if people chose to unite their abilities to serve the greater good .\nTrivia\n\n"
