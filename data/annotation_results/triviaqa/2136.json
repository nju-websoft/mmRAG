Based in Turin, Juventus have long been a symbol of Italian football, spending their entire history in Serie A, with the exception of the 2006/2007 season as financial irregularities resulted in them being demoted to Serie B. \nAfter spending nearly 60 years playing at the Stadio Comunale Vittorio Pozzo, Juventus moved to the Stadio delle Alpi in 1990, spending the next 15 years at the stadium before moving again in 2005 to the Stadio Olimpico and then again in 2011 to the Juventus Stadium. The club have been owned by the Agnelli family since 1923, in what has been the longest ownership in Italian sports history, with Andrea Agnelli currently serving as Juventus's president. \nNicknamed La Vecchia Signora (The Old Lady), Juventus have long been integral to the Italian national team's success in terms of producing talent, playing a key role in Italy's World Cup triumphs of 1934, 1982 and 2006.  \nWith 54 official titles on the national and international stage to their name, Juventus have won more titles than any other Italian club. With an unmatched record of 29 league, nine Coppa Italia, and six Super Coppa Italiana titles, Juventus have long been Italy's most successful side. \nAnd it's not only domestically where Juventus have dominated. With two Intercontinental Cups, two European Champion Clubs' Cup/UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups, one UEFA Intertoto Cup and two UEFA Super Cups, the club are European football's fourth most successful club and eighth in the world.\nThe club's most successful manager has been Giovanni Trapattoni, who led the club to six Serie A titles, two Italian Cups, one European Champions Clubs' Cup, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, two UEFA Cups, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup during his two spells in charge of the club between 1976 and 1986 and then again from 1991 to 1995. The Italian coach is also the club's longest-serving manager with 13 seasons, ten of which were consecutive during his first stint as manager. \nFormer Juve captain Antonio Conte was named manager in 2011, leading the club to back-to-back Serie A and Supercoppa Italiana titles in 2011/2012 and 2012/2013, and the former midfielder will be looking to continue building a new golden era for the club. \nFor all the latest Juventus Betting Tips place check out betting.betfair\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nChampions League: Real Madrid stunned by Juventus ... nicknamed 'La Vecchia Signora' or 'old lady' in ... and cup double and a European Champions ...

In 1933 they began playing at the Stadio Comunale. Post war the club was very successful domestically, winning its tenth championship in 1961 , but did not win any European titles until the 1970s with the UEFA Cup . The height of European success was not reached until 1985 . European Cup success was repeated in 1995 .\nThe club stadium is the 69,041-seat Stadio Delle Alpi (shared with A.C. Torino ).\nMany famous players have graced Juventus, including Giampiero Combi, Giampiero Boniperti (later became a famous club president), Omar Sivori, John Charles, Roberto Boninsegna, Gaetano Scirea, Michel Platini , Zbigniew Boniek , Paolo Rossi, Marco Tardelli, Antonio Cabrini, Claudio Gentile, Franco Causio, Roberto Bettega (current President), Dino Zoff , Andrea Fortunato, Gianluca Vialli, Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane , Filippo Inzaghi, Alessandro Del Piero , Roberto Baggio , Edgar Davids , Alen Boksic, Pavel Nedved, and Christian Vieri.\nThe sale of Zinedine Zidane to Real Madrid was the most expensive in football to date, costing the Spanish club over $64 million (US).\nWith Giovanni Trapattoni ( coach ), Juventus provided 9 players on 11 for the Italian national team (like in Argentina , 1978 ).\nUntil recently, Juventus' players had to wear short (and regular) hair; the club also provided the team with official formal wear (made by famous tailors) and forced them to complete their educational studies. Most of its players remained with Juventus until the end of their careers; many still work for it or for Fiat (or related companies).\nJuventus is now a corporation, listed on Milan 's stock exchange .\nJuventus' Achievements\nIn terms of league championships (called Albo d'Oro (palmar�s)) the club is perhaps the most successful in Italian football.\nLeague Championships: 27\n1905, 1925-26, 1930-31, 1931-32, 1932-33, 1933-34, 1934-35,  1949-50, 1951-52, 1957-58, 1959-60, 1960-61, 1966-67, 1971-72, 1972-73, 1974-75, 1976-77, 1977-78, 1980-81, 1981-82, 1983-84, 1985-86, 1994-95, 1996-97, 1997-98, 2001-02, 2002-03.\nItalian Cups: 9\n1937-38, 1941-42, 1958-59, 1959-60, 1964-65, 1978-79, 1982-83, 1989-90, 1994-95.\nItalian Supercups: 4\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nJuventus Football Club (BIT ... century and the second most successful European club in the ... number of nicknames, la Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady) ... Sports and Players: Juventus Football Club Sports and Players: Juventus Football Club\nSports and Players\nJuventus Football Club\nJuventus Football Club (BIT: JUVE) (from Latin iuventus: youth),  commonly referred to as Juventus and colloquially as Juve, are a  professional Italian football club based in Turin, Piedmont. The club is  the third oldest of its kind in  the country and has spent its entire  history, with the exception of the  2006–07 season, in the top flight  First Division (knowns as Serie A  since 1929).  \n \nFounded in 1897 as Sport  Club Juventus by a group of Torinese young students and linked to  industrial Agnelli family since 1923, the  club has become a symbol of  Italian culture and italianità  (Italianity),reflected, among others, in  its contribution to the  national team, uninterrupted since the second  half of 1920s and  recognised as one of the largest and most important in  the world, and,  due to ideological politics and socio-economic origin  of the club's  sympathisers and their massive presence of all over the  country and,  abroad, mainly in countries with a significant presence of  Italian  immigrants, through its fan base, larger than any other Italian  club  and one of the largest world-wide.\n \nJuventus  are historically the  most successful team in Italian football and one  of the most successful  and recognised in the world. According to the  International Federation  of Football History and Statistics, an  organization recognised by FIFA,  Juventus were Italy's best club of the  20th century and the second most  successful European club in the same  period. The club currently ranks  third in Europe and sixth in the world  with the most international  titles won officially recognised by their  respective association  football confederation and FIFA.\n \nIn  1985, Juventus became the first club  in the history of European  football to have won all three major UEFA  competitions, the European  Champion Clubs' Cup, the (now-defunct) UEFA  Cup Winners' Cup and the  UEFA Cup (first Italian and Southern European  side to win the  competition). After their triumph in the  Intercontinental Cup the same  year, Juventus also became the first  football team ever remain the only  one at present to have won all  possible confederation competitions and  the club world title.\n Juventus  have played in black and white striped shirts, with white  shorts,  sometimes black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in  pink  shirts with a black tie, but only because they had been sent the  wrong  shirts. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts,  but  continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club  sought  to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members,  Englishman  John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could  supply new  shirts in a color that would better withstand the elements.\n \nHe  had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County   supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juve   have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colors to be   aggressive and powerful. Juventus Football Club's official emblem has   undergone different and small modifications since the 1920s. The last   modification of the Old Lady's badge took place before 2004–05 season.   At the present time, the emblem of the team is a black-and-white oval   shield of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five   vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside   which are the following elements; in its upper section, the name of the   society superimposed on a white convex section, over golden curvature   (gold for honour).\n \nThe  white silhouette of a charging bull is in the  lower section of the  oval shield, superimposed on a black old French  shield; the charging  bull is a symbol of the Comune di Torino. There is also a black  silhouette of a mural crown above the black spherical  triangle's base  is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of  the Roman era  which the present capital of Piedmont region is its  cultural heiress.  In the past, the convex section of the emblem had a  blue color (another  symbol of Turin) and, furthermore, its shape was  concave. The old  French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower  section of the  emblem, had a considerably greater size with respect to  the present.\n \nThe  two Golden Stars for Sport Excellence were located  above the convex  and concave section of Juventus' emblem. During the  1980s, the club  emblem was the silhouette of a zebra, to both sides of  the equide's  head, the two golden stars and, above this badge, forming  an arc, the  club's name. During its history, the club has acquired a  number of  nicknames, la Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady) being the best  example.  The \"old\" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means  \"youth\"  in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star  players  towards the middle of 1930s. The \"lady\" part of the nickname is  how  fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s.\n \nThe   club is also nicknamed la Fidanzata d'Italia (the Girlfriend of Italy),  because over the years it has received a high level of support  from  Southern Italian immigrant workers (particularly from Naples and   Palermo), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other   nicknames include; i bianconeri (the black-and-whites),le zebre (the   zebras) in reference to Juventus' colors and i gobbi (the hunchbacks),   because \"old ladies\" usually have hunched backs.\nThe  Trapattoni-era was highly successful in the 1980s; the club started   the decade off well, winning the league title three more times by 1984.   This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles and were allowed  to  add a second golden star to their shirt, thus becoming the only  Italian  club to achieve this. Around this time the club's players were   attracting considerable attention; Paolo Rossi was named European   Footballer of the Year following his contribution to Italy's victory in   the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was named player of the tournament.   Frenchman Michel Platini was also awarded the European Footballer of the   Year title for three years in a row; 1983, 1984 and 1985, which is a   record.\n \nJuventus  are the only club to have players from their club  winning the award in  four consecutive years. Indeed it was Platini who  scored the winning  goal in the 1985 European Cup final against  Liverpool, however this was  marred by a tragedy which changed European  football. The Heysel  Stadium disaster, in which 39 people (mostly  Juventus fans) were killed  when a stadium wall collapsed, has been  called by UEFA Chief Executive  Lars-Christer Olsson in 2004, \"the  darkest hour in the history of the  UEFA competitions\", and resulted in  the banning of all English clubs  from European competition. With the  exception of winning the closely  contested Italian Championship of  1985–86, the rest of the 1980s were  not very successful for the club.\n \nAs   well as having to contend with Diego Maradona's Napoli, both of the   Milanese clubs, Milan and Internazionale, won Italian championships. In   1990, Juventus moved into their new home, the Stadio delle Alpi, which   was built for the 1990 World Cup. The Juventus youth set-up has been   recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents.   While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed   successful careers in the Italian top flight. Under long-time coach   Vincenzo Chiarenza, the Primavera (Under-20) squad enjoyed one of its   successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to   2006.\n \nThe  youth system is also notable for its contribution to the  Italian  national senior and youth teams. 1934 World Cup winner Gianpiero  Combi,  1936 Gold Medal and 1938 World Cup winner Pietro Rava, Giampiero   Boniperti, Roberto Bettega, 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi and more   recently, Domenico Criscito and Claudio Marchisio are a number of former   graduates who have been capped at the full international level. Like   Dutch club Ajax and many English Premier League clubs, Juventus operates   several satellite clubs and soccer schools outside of the country  (i.e.  United States, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and  Switzerland)  and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent  scouting.\n \nAfter  the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played  in  the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held   in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905, the first year   of the scudetto, and in 1906, years in which it played quickly Corso Re   Umberto. From 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal  competitions  at Corso Sebastopoli Camp, and before moving the following  year to  Corso Marsiglia Camp where they remained until 1933, winning  four league  titles. At the end of 1933 they began to play at the new  Stadio  Mussolini stadium inaugurated for the 1934 World Championships.  After  the Second World War, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Comunale   Vittorio Pozzo. Juventus played home matches at the ground for 57  years,  a total of 890 league matches.\nSince  January 2001 Juventus Football Club is headquartered in an  elegant  building which is located at 32, Corso Galileo Ferraris, in  Turin.  Various offices spread over four floors. There are 75 workers who  are  divided in sections as follows: Administration – Commercial – Communications – Management – Planning, Supervision and Special Projects – Human Resources – Area Sports. Juventus are also used as a  headquarters office location Juventus  Merchandising, which manages  licensing agreements on projects and also  Juventus Soccer Schools. No  part of office are offered to the public.  Ticketing process was  conducted in Corso Galileo Ferraris, but tickets  can only be purchased  through other channels, such as Lottomatica Stores  and Juventus.com  official website. Based on history, Juventus have been several times  enter into the  turn of the headquarters. The first time Juventus  headquarters in Via  Montevecchio in 1898. After a few brief periods at  number 4, Via Piazzi  (1899), 14 Via Gazometro (1900-1902), Via  Pastrengo (1903-1904), 1 Via  Donati (1905-1906), 43 Via Carlo Alberto  (1919-1921), 16 via Botero  (1921-1922), then some long-term thinking  began triggered: First,  starting from year 1923 through 1933, is  located at the Corso Marsiglia  ground, a place where teams compete at  that time. For almost a decade  (1934-1943), the club’s headquarters  moved to 12 Via Bogino later,  between 1944 and 1947, moved to 151 Corso  IV Novembre (which is now the  Circolo della Stampa).\nAfter  all these changes, since 1948 Juventus have only four “home”.  In the  period 1948 and 1964 in piazza San Carlo 206, then in 1965  changed its  domicile to 54 Galleria San Federico, a place where they  lived for 10  years before returning to change domicile, by reason of the  capacity of  the room, into an imposing building located at 7 Piazza  Crimea. Since  January 2001, this club again increased its number of employees and move  into the residence was occupied at the time.\n \nThe  team continued to host training  sessions at the stadium until July   2003. From 1990 until the 2005–06  season, the Torinese side contested   their home matches at Stadio delle  Alpi, built for the 1990 FIFA World   Cup, although in very rare  circumstances, the club played some home   games in other stadia such as  Renzo Barbera at Palermo, Dino Manuzzi at   Cesena and the Stadio Giuseppe  Meazza at Milan. In August 2006, the   bianconeri returned to play in the  Stadio Comunale, now known as Stadio   Olimpico, after the restructuring  of the stadium for the 2006 Winter   Olympics onwards. In November 2008  Juventus announced that they will   invest around €100 million to build a  new stadium on the site of the   old Delle Alpi ground. Unlike the Delle  Alpi there will not be a   running track; instead the pitch will be only  8.5 meters away from the   stands. The planned capacity is 41,000. Work  began during spring 2009   and is scheduled for completion in time for the  start of the 2011-12   season. \nJuventus Football Club\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nJuventus Football Club is one of Italy's ... and is nicknamed la Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady, ...

The club is      also one of only four to have won all three major European      trophies.\nUntil recently, Juventus' players had to wear short (and      regular) hair; the club also provided the team with official      formal wear (made by famous tailors) and forced them to complete      their educational studies. Most of its players remained with      Juventus until the end of their careers; many still work for it      or for Fiat (or related companies).\nJuventus is now a corporation, listed on Milan's stock exchange.      The sale of Zinedine Zidane to Real Madrid of Spain was the most      expensive in football to date, costing the Spanish club over $64      million (US).  \nJuventus FC Honours, Trophies & Awards\nItalian       Championships: 27\n1905, 1925-26,        1930-31, 1931-32, 1932-33, 1933-34, 1934-35, 1949-50,        1951-52, 1957-58, 1959-60, 1960-61, 1966-67, 1971-72,        1972-73, 1974-75, 1976-77, 1977-78, 1980-81, 1981-82,        1983-84, 1985-86, 1994-95, 1996-97, 1997-98, 2001-02,        2002-03.\nItalian Cups: 9\n1937-38, 1941-42,        1958-59, 1959-60, 1964-65, 1978-79, 1982-83, 1989-90,        1994-95.\nItalian Supercups:       4\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\nLargest selection and competitive prices for Juventus Tickets. ... the Juventus Football Club is the 3rd best ... and is nicknamed la Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady, ...
