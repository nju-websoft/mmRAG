The six countries in Africa the equator does ... Can You Name the 13 Countries That Lie on the ... What Countries Does the Equator Run Through in Africa? Which African Countries are Located on the Equator?\nWhich African Countries are Located on the Equator?\nCrossing the Equator, Gabon.  Tim Makins/ Lonely Planet Images/ Getty Images\nBy Anouk Zijlma\nUpdated November 21, 2016.\nThe equator is the imaginary line that separates the northern hemisphere from the southern hemisphere and runs across the center of the Earth at a latitude of exactly zero degrees. In Africa, the equator runs for almost 2,500 miles/ 4,020 kilometers through seven  West , Central and East African countries just south of the Sahara Desert. Ironically, the list of African countries bisected by the equator does not include Equatorial Guinea . Instead, they are as follows: São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon , Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Uganda , Kenya and Somalia. \nExperiencing the Equator\nIn the past, it was possible for intrepid travelers to follow the equator on its journey through Africa. However, the route is no longer safe, with several of the countries along the equatorial line plagued by civil war, terrorism, crippling poverty and piracy. The imaginary line also traverses some of the most extreme environments on Earth - including the remote jungles of the Congo, the mist-soaked mountains of Uganda and the deep waters of the largest lake in Africa , Lake Victoria.\ncontinue reading below our video\nTipping Etiquette Around the World\nHowever, while traveling the length of the equator is no longer advisable, visiting it at least once is an unmissable African experience.\nThe equator's position is directly related to that of the Earth's rotating axis, which moves slightly throughout the course of the year. Therefore, the equator isn't static - which means that the line drawn on the ground at some equatorial markers is not always entirely accurate. However, this is a technical detail, and these markers are still the closest that you can get to the center of the Earth.  Pay any one of them a visit, and you'll be able to say that you've straddled the equator with one foot in each hemisphere. \nAfrica's Equatorial Markers\nOften, the African equator is marked without much fanfare. Usually, a sign at the side of the road is the only indication that you'll have of your momentous location - so it's important to research where the line is in advance so that you can keep a watchful eye out for it. In Kenya, there are signs announcing the equator in the rural towns of Nanyuki and Siriba, while similar signs exist on the Masala- Kampala road in Uganda, and the  Libreville -Lambaréné road in Gabon.\nOne of Africa's most beautiful equatorial markers belongs to its second smallest country, São Tomé and Príncipe. The island nation celebrates its equatorial location with a stone monument and a frieze of the world map located on tiny Rolas Island . The imaginary line also runs through Kenya's Meru National Park , and while there's no marker, there's a certain novelty to game-viewing directly on top of the equator. At luxury hotel Fairmont Mount Kenya Safari Club Resort , you can cross the equator just by walking from your room to the restaurant.\nEquatorial Phenomena\nIf you do find yourself on the equator, take a moment to test a few of the bizarre facts and theories connected with standing on the line between both hemispheres. The force of the planet's rotation causes a bulge in the Earth's surface at the equator, which means that you're further from the Earth's center here than anywhere else on the planet. Gravity therefore exerts less of a pull on your body, so that at the equator, you weigh approximately 0.5% less than you would at the Poles.\nSome also believe that the rotation of the Earth has an affect on the direction in which draining water flows - so that a toilet flushes clockwise in the northern hemisphere and anticlockwise in the southern hemisphere. This phenomenon is known as the Coriolis Effect and should dictate that at the equator, water flows straight down the drain. Most scientists agree that due to a high number of external factors, this can't be proven with any real accuracy - but it's still fun to check it out for yourself. \nThis article was updated and re-written in part by Jessica Macdonald on November 21st 2016.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nThe Gabonese Republic lies along the equator on the west coast of Africa with a border length of 2,551 ...

(Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a ... Africa, Asia, and ... The Equator, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn The Equator, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn\nBy Matt Rosenberg\nUpdated August 31, 2016.\nThree of the most significant imaginary lines running across the surface of the Earth are the equator, the Tropic of Cancer, and the Tropic of Capricorn. While the equator is the longest line of latitude on the Earth (the line where the Earth is widest in an east-west direction), the tropics are based on the sun's position in relation to the Earth at two points of the year. All three lines of latitude are significant in their relationship between the Earth and the sun.\nThe Equator\nThe equator is located at zero degrees latitude . The equator runs through Indonesia, Ecuador, northern Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Kenya, among other countries . It is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers) long. On the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes - near March and September 21. The equator divides the planet into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. On the equator, the length of day and night are equal every day of the year - day is always twelve hours long and night is always twelve hours long.\ncontinue reading below our video\nOverview of the Four Seasons\nThe Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn\nThe Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn each lie at 23.5 degrees latitude. The Tropic of Cancer is located at 23.5° North of the equator and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia , India, and southern China. The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 23.5° South of the equator and runs through Australia, Chile, southern Brazil (Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a tropic), and northern South Africa .\nThe tropics are the two lines where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two solstices - near June and December 21. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 (the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21 (the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere).\nThe reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5° north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year.\nThe area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the \"tropics.\" This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky. Only higher latitudes, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, experience significant seasonal variation in climate. Realize, however, that areas in the tropics can be cold. The peak of Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii stands nearly 14,000 feet above sea level, and snow is not unusual.\nIf you live north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun will never be directly overhead. In the United States, for example, Hawaii is the only location in the country that is south of the Tropic of Cancer, and it is thus the only location in the United States where the sun will be directly overhead in the summer..\nPrime Meridian\nWhile the equator divides the Earth into Northern and Southern Hemispheres , it is the Prime Meridian at zero degrees longitude and the line of longitude opposite the Prime Meridian (near the International Date Line ) at 180 degrees longitude that divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres . The Eastern Hemisphere consists of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia while the Western Hemisphere includes North and South America . Some geographers place the boundaries between the hemispheres at 20° West and 160° East so as to not run through Europe and Africa. Unlike the equator and the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, the Prime Meridian and all lines of longitude are completely imaginary lines and have no significance with regard to the Earth or to its relationship with the sun.\n\n"
