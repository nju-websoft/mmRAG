Approximately 118 miles wide and 307 miles long, Lake Michigan has more than 1,600 miles of shoreline. Averaging 279 feet in depth, the lake reaches 925 feet at its deepest point. The lake's northern tier is in the colder, less developed upper Great Lakes region, while its more temperate southern basin contains the Milwaukee and Chicago metropolitan areas. The drainage basin, approximately twice as large as the 22,300 square miles of surface water, includes portions of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Lake Michigan is hydrologically inseparable from Lake Huron, joined by the wide Straits of Mackinac.\nReferences: Great Lakes Atlas , Environment Canada and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1995\n \nAn Advocate's Field Guide to Protecting Lake Michigan\nAlliance for the Great Lakes\nAfter two years of research by organizations around Lake Michigan, this guidebook identifies basinwide threats; it is organized into three chapters: habitat restoration, toxic elimination and land and water conservation.\nOhio State University and NOAA, Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory\nThe Great Lakes Forecasting System provides physical data about the lake, including this bathymetry map.\nBathymetry of Lake Michigan\nU.S. National Geophysical Data Center\nAs part of NOAA's Great Lakes Data Rescue Project, this ite features images of lake depth and lakefloor topography.\nUniversity of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute\nColor illustrations or photographs, size, coloring and other information about many Lake Michigan fish species.\nNOAA, Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL)\nA map using NOAA satellite data to show recent water temperatures of the Great Lakes.\nHistoric Data - Lake Michigan\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Detroit District\nThe Army Corps provides current and historic data on the Great Lakes, including yearly water levels from 1918, monthly storm probability, outflows and precipitation.\nSurface Water Temperature\nUniversity of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute\nCheck out the Sea Grant Coastwatch, which provides real-time surface water temperatures for Lake Michigan and its ports.\n \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO)\nProvides links to Lake Michigan LaMPs, AOCs, Environmental Sensitivity Index, and other projects.\nLake Michigan Biological Station\nIllinois Natural History Survey\nResearch at LMBS is designed to improve management of various Lake Michigan fisheries and to better understand the ecology of the lake.\nLake Michigan Coastal Coordination Program\nIndiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR)\nIn May 1995, the Indiana Natural Resources Commission adopted a Resolution to formally recognize the importance of the Lake Michigan coastal region to the state and to rededicate the professional staff of the Commission and the DNR in service to the region.\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO)\nProvides the most updated information on the Lake Michigan LaMP.\nLake Michigan Mass Balance Study\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO)\nMass balance studies are a scientific method for evaluating the sources, transport and fate of contaminants entering a water system, and the effects of those contaminants on water quality.

Its name is derived from the Ojibwa Indian word mishigami, meaning large lake.\nLake Michigan's water surface is 22,300 square miles (57,800 square kilometers). It is the second largest of the Great Lakes by volume (1,180 cubic miles / 4,920 cubic km). Only Lake Superior is bigger.\nLake Michigan touches Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. Chicago is at the lake’s southernmost point, and Milwaukee is located on the southwestern shore of the lake.\nThe Mackinac Bridge connects Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas at the straits between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan.\nCredit: lphoto Shutterstock\nOn the northern end, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron are connected by the Straits of Mackinac, and technically, these two bodies of water are one lake.\nThere are a number of beaches along the coast, and the Great Lakes are sometimes referred to as the “ Third Coast ” behind the Pacific and Atlantic (the Gulf Coast notwithstanding).\nFormation, discovery and history\nThe formation that is recognized as Lake Michigan today began about 1.2 billion years ago when two tectonic plates were ripped apart, creating the Mid-Continent Rift. \nFrench explorer Samuel de Champlain sent his underling Jean Nicolett to find the “Northwest Passage” but he ended up discovering Lake Michigan around 1634. In 1679, Nicolette explored the southernmost part of the lake where modern-day Chicago is.\nLike all of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan has had its share of shipwrecks. One of the most famous maritime disasters was the sinking of the Westmoreland, a steamer that sank on Dec. 7, 1854. The wreck was discovered by a diver on July 7, 2010, 155 years after the accident, in excellent condition.\nWater temperature\nWater temperatures on Lake Michigan make it to the 60s in July and August and can sometimes make it into the 70s when air temperatures have been in the 90s for a number of continuous days.\nThe water of Lake Michigan has an unusual circulatory pattern — it resembles the traffic flow in a suburban cul-de-sac — and moves very slowly. Winds and resulting waves keep Lake Michigan from freezing over, but it has been 90 percent frozen on a number of occasions. Ocean-like swells, especially during the winter, can result in a drastic temperature changes along the coast, shoreline erosion and difficult navigation.\nThe lake’s average water depth is 279 feet (85 meters) and its maximum depth is 925 feet (282 meters).\nLife on Lake Michigan\nMarshes, tallgrass prairies, savannas, forests and sand dunes that can reach several hundred feet, all provide excellent habitats for all types of wildlife on Lake Michigan.\nTrout, salmon, walleye, and smallmouth bass fisheries are prevalent on the lake. The lake is also home to crawfish, freshwater sponges and sea lamprey, a metallic violet species of eel.\nThe lake is also home to a wide range of bird populations, including water birds such as ducks, geese and swans, as well as crows, robins and bald eagles. Predatory birds such as hawks and vultures are also prevalent on the lake, due to the wealth of wildlife to feast upon.\nThe pebble-shaped Petoskey stone, which is a fossilized coral, is unique to the northern Michigan shores of Lake Michigan and is the state stone.\nAuthor Bio\nKim Ann Zimmermann, Live Science Contributor\nKim Ann Zimmermann is a contributor to Live Science.

Lake Michigan Facts and Figures - Great Lakes Information ... Lake Michigan Facts and Figures\nLake Michigan is the third largest Great Lake by surface area and the sixth largest freshwater lake in the world.\n \nBecause Lake Michigan is joined to Lake Huron at the Straits of Mackinac, they are considered one lake hydrologically.\n \nMany rivers and streams flow into Lake Michigan, and the major tributaries are the Fox-Wolf, the Grand and the Kalamazoo.\n \nThere is a diversion from the lake into the Mississippi River basin through the Illinois Waterway at the Chicago River.\n \nLake Michigan's cul-de-sac formation means that water entering the lake circulates slowly and remains for a long time (retention) before it leaves the basin through the Straits of Mackinac.\n \nSmall lunar tidal effects have been documented for Lake Michigan1.\n \nInternal waves (upwellings) can produce a 15 degree C. water temperature decrease along the coast in only a few hours, requiring drastic alterations in fishing strategy1.\n \nThe northern part of the Lake Michigan watershed is covered with forests, sparsely populated, and economically dependent on natural resources and tourism, while the southern portion is heavily populated with intensive industrial development and rich agricultural areas along the shore.\n \nThe world's largest freshwater dunes line the lakeshore.\n \nMillions of people annually visit the dunes/beaches at state and national parks and lakeshores.\n \nReferences: Lake Michigan brochure, 1990, Michigan Sea Grant\n1 [Ayers, John C. \"Great Lakes Waters, Their Circulation and Physical and Chemical Characteristics,\" in Great Lakes Basin: A symposium presented at the Chicago Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 29-30 December, 1959. ed.

It was later named \"Lake of the Stinking Water\" or \"Lake of the Puants,\" after the people who occupied its shores. In 1679, the lake became known as Lac des Illinois because it gave access to the country of the Indians, so named. Three years before, Allouez called it Lac St. Joseph, by which name it was often designated by early writers. Others called it Lac Dauphin. Through the further explorations of Jolliet and Marquette, the \"Lake of the Stinking Water\" received its final name of Michigan.\n \nAnother story recounts that Nicolet, the first European to set foot in Wisconsin in 1634, landed on the shores of Green Bay and was greeted by Winnebago Indians, whom the French called \"Puans.\" Lake Michigan was labeled as \"Lake of Puans\" on an early and incomplete 1670 map of the region that showed only the northern shores of the lake. However, only Green Bay is labeled as \"Baye de Puans\" (Bay of the Winnebago Indians) on maps from 1688 and 1708. On the 1688 map, Lake Michigan is called Lac des Illinois.\n \nAn Indian name for Lake Michigan was \"Michi gami.\"\n \nReferences: Great Lakes Atlas , Environment Canada and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1995\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nMichigan's Great Lakes. ...
