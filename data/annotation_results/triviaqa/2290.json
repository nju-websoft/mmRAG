COUNTIES - Pictures of England - Exploring England with ... Counties of England\nCounties in England\nExploring the counties of England with history and pictures.\nThe history of the counties of England dates back to early Anglo-Saxon times when âshiresâ were first formed as a way of raising taxes and when the nation of England was first created. These Anglo-Saxon shires usually had a fortified town at the centre, known back then as the âshire townâ. The word âCountyâ came later, being first introduced by the Normans when they conquered England back in 1066 and has its origins in French, simply meaning a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a âCountâ.\nThe words âcountyâ and âcountiesâ  therefore are derived from French (from the Normans) but most of the county names themselves still kept (and retain today) their original Anglo-Saxon names, such as âWorcestershireâ or âBedfordshireâ which is simply the name of the shire or county town, with the suffix of shire.\nThere are other counties however that got their name differently, such as Cornwall, and Devon, both of which take their names from the Celtic tribes that inhabited the regions, such as the âCornoviiâ in Cornwall . Other exceptions include todays Kent, which derives from the Kingdom of Kent, and Sussex (both East and West) and Essex. These names derive from the East Saxons (Essex) and the South Saxons (Sussex). The county names of Norfolk and Suffolk, derive from the âNorth Folkâ and âSouth Folkâ of the ancient Kingdom of East Anglia.\nEach county link below will take you to the main county page where we list all the wonderful historic towns, villages and attractions that each county has to offer. You will also find a Picture Tour for each county, offering a diverse selection of the wonderful towns, attractions and varying landscapes. We hope you enjoy viewing the beautiful counties of England..\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nCounty with the longest coastline General ...

Not that it matters. It's just jostling for position by tourist boards, I'd say.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nGenealogy and Norfolk, England. ... An Essay Towards a Topographical History of the County of Norfolk is the only major ... I have set up a separate page to give ... Genealogy and Norfolk, England - TalkTalk Genealogy and Norfolk, England\nGenealogy and Norfolk, England\nIntroduction\nThis page is devoted to the county of Norfolk, England, and covers the origin of its name, an outline of its history and geography, links to other web sites concerned with the county, genealogical resources relating to the county and the same types of information in more detail for those cities, towns and villages in the county in which I have a family history interest. In doing this, it is not my intention to duplicate unnecessarily, nor to compete with, web pages which already do some of those things, but to complement such pages and provide links to them, with appropriate description of what they have to offer.\nMy maternal grandfather's mother and her parents were born in west Norfolk, hence my interest.\nGeography\nNorfolk is one of the largest counties in England in terms of area; before the 1974 reorganisation it ranked fourth behind Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Devon, and covers a little over 1.3 million acres.\nAs the map above shows, Norfolk is situated on the east coast of Britain, with the North Sea to the east and north and that remarkable inlet The Wash forming the northern half of its boundary to the west. Adjacent counties are Suffolk to the south, Cambridgeshire (that part formerly the Isle of Ely) to the south west and Lincolnshire to the west and facing it across The Wash.\nNorfolk has the reputation of being flat, but anyone cycling in the county will tell you that depends very much on which part of the county you are talking about. The western part south of The Wash is certainly very flat, being a part of the fens , and so is the south east section, known as the Broads. While the county contains no great heights, the city of Norwich and the north of the county especially are quite hilly.\nThe fens are now rich, peaty arable land, formed by the drainage of the huge alkaline marshland which formerly occupied the area. East of the fens is the Breckland, an infertile sandy area shared with neighbouring Suffolk; much of it is used for forestry, but it also contains large areas of open heath. The hills in the north of the county are again rather sandy, but more fertile, while the north coast is almost entirely lined with extensive salt marshes, used for cattle grazing and with many large nature reserves, making this area probably the most popular in Britain with ornithologists. The Broads in the south east are a series of large shallow lakes formed centuries ago by peat digging; the lakes are mostly linked with the various rivers of the area, adding leisure boating to wildlife watching as a major tourist attraction; this area is very rich pasture land for both sheep and cattle.\nNorfolk is well served with rivers, though none are very big. The most important are the lower reaches of the Great Ouse, which forms the main drainage of the fens and meets The Wash at Kings Lynn, the Yare, running diagonally across the centre of the county to meet the sea at Great Yarmouth, and its major tributary the Waveney which forms much of the border with Suffolk. Others are the Bure, running almost parallel with the coast in the north-east, and the Little Ouse, forming much of the remainder of the Suffolk and Cambridgeshire boundaries on its way to join the Great Ouse south of Downham Market.\nObservant readers may also notice on the larger scale map a pair of parallel lines in the south west, just west of the Great Ouse. These are huge drainage channels, constructed to prevent flooding by the river and linked to it by sluices further south. The land between them is deliberately flooded every winter to protect the surrounding land (some of which is below sea level). The flooded area attracts large numbers of migrant wild swans every winter, as well as ducks and other water-loving birds, and during summer is used for pasture. These two channels, and much of the main river, are in places well above the level of the fields around them, being retained by huge earthen banks.\nThe main towns in Norfolk are Norwich, towards the east, Kings Lynn in the west, Great Yarmouth on the east coast and Thetford on the southern boundary. Norwich is the main industrial city, although less important now than it was a few centuries ago, when it was a major centre of the woollen industry. Kings Lynn was one of Britain's main ports, but silting up of the river mouth and the difficulty in navigating the shallow Wash with large vessels led to its decline. Great Yarmouth was one of the main fishing ports in the country, but the reduction in herrings in the North Sea have caused it to switch function, it now being a popular holiday resort with sandy beaches and easy access to the Broads. Other smaller holiday resorts are found round most of the coast, especially at Cromer, Sheringham, Wells and Hunstanton.\nHistory\nNorfolk has been the scene of no major battles, and few events of national importance have occurred here since Roman times, although it has produced probably more than its fair share of people of national imortance.\nThe earliest sign of man in the area that I am aware of is the group of filled-in pits in the south-west known as Grimes' Graves. Despite the name, they were not a burial ground but a Neolithic mining area, where high quality flint was dug from considerable depths. Two ancient roads run nearby, which were probably used to export the flint to other areas. The Icknield Way runs south-west, following the line of chalk hills to Wiltshire and then on to Wales. The shorter Peddars Way runs northwards through the west-centre of Norfolk itself.\nLater the area was settled, like most of Britain, by Celtic tribes, in particular those known to the Romans as Iceni, whose queen, Boadicea led the great rebellion against Roman rule, including the burning of the major Roman cities of Colchester and London.\nThe name of the county, as described above, comes from the later settlement by Angles, who largely ignored the existing towns to create their own hamlets and villages, one of which became the city of Norwich. There followed a troubled period when East Anglia was conquered in succession by Danes and Normans, then it was the seat of a major rebellion against the crown, before eventually settling down in the later part of the 11th century to several centuries of almost continuous prosperity, based initially on the export of wool to which was later added the manufacture of leather and weaving of the wool before its export as cloth.\nThis latter development was brought about mainly by the immigration of thousands of settlers from Netherlands, who went on to use their skills in draining much of the fens and reforming many aspects of agriculture.\nThis prosperity reached its peak in the 18th century, when Norfolk was one of the wealthiest and most densely populated counties in Britain. It then contained over 700 rural parishes, more than 1,500 manors, one of the largest cities in England (Norwich) and two other substantial boroughs (Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn).\nIn the early 19th century, competition from the textile industries of Lancashire and Yorkshire, brought economic collapse in a county unable to compete with the cheap local energy sources (coal and fast streams) of its northern rivals. This period coincided with the agricultural slump affecting the whole country at this time, leading to a major depopulation of the countryside as people migrated to the growing slums of Norwich. In 1848 20% of the city's population were classed as paupers, and Norwich had one of the highest mortality rates in Britain.\nThe 20th century has seen some revival in Norfolk's fortunes as industries have diversified, but especially important has been the growth of tourism, which is now the county's main occupation.\nA Norfolk Bibliography\nTwo early works (don't be put off by the Latin title of the first) are:\nWilliam Worcester (1415-1482?): Itineraria Symonis Simeonis et Willelmi de Worcestre, (1778, edited by J. Nasmith and 1969, edited by J.H. Harvey);\nAnon: Chorography of Norfolk (written 1604, edited by C.M. Hood for publication 1938).\nFrancis Blomefield: An Essay Towards a Topographical History of the County of Norfolk is the only major history of the county. Only two of his intended five volumes had been published by his death. The remainder were written \"less thoroughly\" by Rev. Charles Parkin, and the work was published in 1810. The best known edition was published in eleven volumes in 1811.\nOther important books for the student of Norfolk history are:\nA Bibliography of Norfolk History (published 1975 by University of East Anglia and updated in 1991);\nAn Historical Atlas of norfolk (published 1993 by the Federation of Norfolk Historical and Archaeological Organisations).\nOther major sources are:\nSome Places in Norfolk\nTo appear in this section a town or village has to meet a number of criteria. First, it has to be of family history interest to me; in other words, one or more of my or my wife's ancestors lived there. Second, I must have, or have access to, the appropriate information to be able to set up the page. Third, I must have managed to find the time to do it. Finally, if I am aware that it has already been done by someone else, all that will be found here is a link to that other site.\nHowever, for completeness sake, if the place meets the first criterion but fails on one or more of the others, then it will at least appear here as a heading, so the reader will have some idea which places may &QUOT;get the treatment&QUOT; at some time in the future.\nFlitcham\nMy great great great grandfather John RIPPINGALE married Honour NAILER here in 1794, and his parents Edward RIPPINGALE and Elizabeth BARKER married here in 1760. These two photos show the outside (click on the thumbnail for a larger image 32,471 bytes) and inside (34,530 bytes) respectively of St. Mary's Church.\n \nFlitcham has a web site which is well worth a look for anyone interested in the village.\nCan anyone help Craig Whitby of Australia, who writes:\n\"John Whitby and Constance Moore married 02 Oct 1744 Flitcham Norfolk, children Elizabeth Whitby Christening 07 Apr 1746 Flitcham and Carter Whitby Christening 26 Apr 1756 Flitcham. I am trying to find out Johns dob etc and to see if my grandfathers go back to Whitby in Yorkshire. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.\"\nIf you can help, please click on his name above to send him a message.\nFring\nMy great great great grandfather John RIPPINGALE was baptised here in 1771, his father Edward was baptised here in 1732 and buried here in 1783, John's mother, Elizabeth (née BARKER) was buried here in 1795, and the known siblings of both John and Edward were all also baptised here.\n \nKing's Lynn\nMy maternal grandfather's mother Emily DYE moved with her parents from West Newton to the ancient port of King's Lynn (sometimes called Lynn Regis). The 1851 census shows them living in South Gate Street, just round the corner from the impressive South Gate, pictured here (click on the thumbnail for a larger image, 25,926 bytes).\n \n \nKing's Lynn Online is an excellent site for learning about the town, very strong on its history and including maps.\nThe Lynn News (local newspaper) site is also worth a visit.\nWeb sites about King's Lynn I have not yet visited include:\nMy maternal grandfather's maternal grandmother Eliza RIPPINGALE was born in Myddleton, a village to the east of King's Lynn and south of West Newton. The parish church, where she was baptised, is shown here (larger image 47,860 bytes).\n \nWest Newton\nMy maternal grandfather's mother was born in the Norfolk village of West Newton, near Sandringham, where her father's family appear to have been settled. I have as yet devoted little time to the area, although I did briefly visit the village church once. I have set up a separate page to give a short description of the village, which includes several photos.\n\n"
