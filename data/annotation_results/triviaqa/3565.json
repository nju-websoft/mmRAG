        "\nDOCUMENT 1:\n\nwalaka said... I have been muttering \"my wings are like a shield of steel\" (in appropriate instances) for years and years and years, and have never met ... The Absorbascon: My wings are like a shield of steel! The Absorbascon: My wings are like a shield of steel!\nSaturday, August 27, 2005\nMy wings are like a shield of steel!\nApparently, not everyone knows who Batfink is. Fortunately, the Absorbascon exists to correct just this kind of cultural injustice. For those not yet in the know, let me add Batfink to your geek-repertoire.\nWithin mere months of the premiere of the Batman television series in 1966, the Hal Seeger Studio produced \"Batfink\" , a  series of short cartoons parodying the runaway hit show. Batfink had a large but ineffective sidekick/chaffeur named \"Karate\" (a snipe at the Green Hornet's Kato). They rode around in their Batillac (I mean, obviously!). Their chief recurring foe was the mad scientist Hugo A-Go-Go; if the Joker and Lex Luthor had a love-child, that child would be Hugo A-Go-Go.\nBatfink had two principal powers (other than superstrength and, you know, flying), and a catch phrase for each one when he used it...\n1. His wings were indestructible/made of steel (whichever the plot required), and when he used them he usually said:\n\"Your bullets [or whatever the threat was] cannot harm me;\nmy wings are like a shield of steel!\"\n2. He also could emit a bat-radar sound in order to find things, whereupon he would invariably say:\n\"My supersonic sonar-radar will help me!\"\nThe supersonic sonar-radar was represented by a large white-lettered BEEP that seemed at times to have a life and intelligence at its own.  You'd have to see it to believe it.\nThese are two phrases of extraordinary power and utility in geekspeak. The first can be used on any occasion when an attack against you fails, whether it be verbal, conceptual, physical, or metaphysical. It's\ngreat for Heroclix games. The second comes in handy when, in the process of struggling with some problem or puzzle, you suddenly think of something that will help you do it. Finding the right internet resource, running a computer diagnostic program, picking up a flyswatter -- those kinds of things. I have soundclips of both sayings, but, sadly, I don't know how to make them accessible to you.\nParodying a parody is not easy, but Batfink did . It also had a marvelous theme song (a simple but memorable trumpet piece).  What's more, there were more episodes of Batfink than there were of Batman! Exactly 100 truly lunatic episodes , culminating in a final, retrospective episode, \"Batfink, This is Your Life!\"\nWhen I was a lad, Batfink was on the air at odds times, like Sunday afternoon, or early, early, early in the morning. But the episodes went out of distribution in the 1980s, so many younger folk have never seen any Batfink. Fortunately, all 100 episodes are available on DVD; unfortunately, they are only available in the UK and Australia (don't ask why).\nBe forewarned; there is a reason a Batfink cartoon is only 5 minutes long. The animation is abominable and the best parody is a SHORT parody. Do NOT sit down and watch the whole DVD. Instead, every time you watch an episode of JLU or The Batman, watch a Batfink episode before or after.\nThat, you will enjoy.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n“My wings are like a shield of steel ….” Batfink, buts, and the inner excusinator “Your bullets can not harm me, my wings are like a shield of ... “My wings are like a shield of steel ….” Batfink, buts ... Three dead moths in my mailbox : “My wings are like a shield of steel ….” Batfink, buts, and the inner excusinator\n“My wings are like a shield of steel ….” Batfink, buts, and the inner excusinator\n“Your bullets can not harm me, my wings are like a shield of steel.”\nThe immortal words of Batfink – cartoon superhero circa late 60s who spent his time saving the world from countless evil villians. It was a spoof on Batman. I loved this cartoon as a child, and as an adult I can’t find any of my peers who remember it. So much so, that I was beginning to think it didn’t exist – until I Googled it of course (nothing exists if it isn’t on Google ;-j). Turns out that he got his powers from being born in an abandoned plutonium mine and that he'd lost his natural wings as a child while saving his mother's life after escaped convicts blew up their mountaintop cave – don’t ya hate when that happens?\nI was reminded of my super hero and his motto when I read the guest post on Nathan Bransford’s blog yesterday. If you are a writer and haven’t heard of Nathan Bransford then say Hi! to the Sasquatch as you leave your cave, because clearly you are living with the elusive mythical beast in a remote mountain cave and eschewing all human contact.\nNathan is one of my favourite agent bloggers. He has nearly 3000 followers and offers a wealth of information about the publishing industry (no matter what genre you write) and he’s funny.\nThe guest blog post Is your 'But' too big? was written by Jon Gibbs . It is about writers who have a whole string of ‘buts’ (excuses as to why they aren’t writing) and who suffer from excusitis (I think we all do from time to time).\nI prefer to think of it as the inner excusinator and when it pops up you need to bludgeon it the same way Batfink’s sidekick Karate would dispatch with criminals.\nIf you’re inner excusinator is acting up and you feel your ‘buts’ are getting too big, just remember the other immortal words of Batfink: “My supersonic sonar radar can help me.”\nAnd get back to writng … and do your homework about the publishing industry and learn what agents are looking for by reading Nathan’s blog .\nPosted by\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nBatfink (character) 87 pages on this wiki. Edit this page Classic editor; History; ... The wings are quoted as \"like a shield of steel\" in the cartoon. Contents Batfink (character) - Batfink wiki - Wikia Batfink (character) | Batfink wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nHe is a parody of both Batman and The Green Hornet\nHe almost always seen reading before getting a call from  The Chief of Police\nDespite being a bat, he is often referred to as \"human\"\nOftentimes when he says his Super Sonar radar will help him, the clip for that line is reused, as evidenced by similiar animation and, in some cases, the voice acting from earlier episodes. There seem to be a couple different versions of this clip, though.\nIn the episode \"Fat Man\" Karate mentions Batfink always wanted to be taller.\nIn the episode \"Out Darn Spot\" it is stated his wings are steel, \"but not stainless steel.\" However, in \"Buster the Ruster\", it is revealed his wings are stainless steel, causing a contradiction in the series.\nHe is never seen driving, suggesting Karate is the only one of the two of them who knows how (or is licensed) to drive.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nBatfink!
