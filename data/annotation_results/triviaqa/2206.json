When Walt Disney first envisioned bringing buccaneers into his first theme park in the late 1950s, he was thinking more of a walk-through attraction. A place where Disneyland Guests would first descend from street level in New Orleans Square and then stroll past this elaborately-themed dungeon which was to be filled with wax tableaux of history's most notorious pirates. Scenes that -- thanks to theatrical lighting & stereo sound effects -- would appear to come to life each time a new group of tourists walked by.\nAnd Walt was fully committed to this early version of Pirates. He even went so far as authorize the start of construction on this attraction. Which is why -- for much of the early 1960s -- there was this huge cellar hole sitting empty next to Adventureland. Early Disneyana fans used to climb up into the Swiss Family Treehouse and then peer down at the enormous pieces of steel which straddled this construction site. Wondering when work would continue on this Pirates-themed show (which -- at that time -- was known as Rogues Gallery).\n\"And why didn't Disney go forward with that version of Pirates of the Caribbean?,\" you ask. Because while his Imagineers were working on rides, shows & attractions for the 1964 - 1965 New York World's Fair , Walt came up with a better idea. He saw how much people enjoyed floating through it's a small world and then looking out at all of those singing Audio-Animatronic children which were positioned along this ride's trough. Which is why Disney decided to ditch the walk-thru version of Rogues Gallery and instead send Disneyland visitors off on a boat ride that would first slide down a waterfall and then take Guests floating past some singing swashbucklers.\nAnd the same exact thing happened with Disneyland's Haunted Mansion . Walt had originally wanted small groups of tourists to take part in a walking tour of this decrepit southern home. Where -- as they were led from room to room by their all-too-human host -- these people would then encounter special effects-filled scenes that the Wizards of WED had worked up which celebrated the supernatural.\n\"And why didn't Walt go ahead with that walk-thru version of the Haunted Mansion?,\" you query. Because with the development of the Omnimover ride system for Disneyland's Adventure Thru Inner Space attraction, the Imagineers now had a far more efficient way to move Guests through a detailed show environment. So even though the exterior of the Haunted Mansion was already built & standing in place along the Rivers of America by 1963, Disney's Imagineers still junked their plans for a walk-thru version of that theme park attraction and opted instead to go with the Doom Buggy-driven ride that we all know today.\nSo why did I bring up those two classic theme park attractions? Because when Tom Staggs -- the Chairman of Walt Disney Parks & Resorts -- was looking at the work-in-progress version of the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train (that new family coaster which officially opened to the general public at WDW's Magic Kingdom earlier today) a few years back... Well, Tom liked what he saw. But he also wondered: Could the Imagineers do a little better with the Audio-Animatronic Dwarfs that were supposed to be dig-dig-digging in this mine the whole day through?\nI mean, WDI's talented team of sculptors had done a brilliant job of translating Doc, Happy et al. into full-sized three dimensional figures. Likewise the Imagineers who were in charge of programming these AA figures had come up with some stylized life-like movements that Staggs was sure would look charming in the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train's main show scene. Which showed the Dwarfs at the very end of their work day just before they began singing \"Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's home from work we go... \" and then exited that diamond mine.\nBut if Tom had a quibble about this already-under-construction piece of Walt Disney World 's New Fantasyland , it was with the faces of the Seven Dwarfs. Which -- due to the hard plastic shell that encases the inner workings of all AA figures (not to mention the  soft vinyl skin which is then placed over that hard plastic shell) -- couldn't quite match all of those squash-and-stretch-filled facial expressions that Disney artists had dreamed up when they were originally animating Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs back in the mid-1930s.\nSo Staggs wondered: Was there a way to make the Audio-Animatronic versions of the Seven Dwarfs actually look more like these character did back in that 1937 Walt Disney Pictures release? And as it turned out, there was.\nEver since the late 1990s, WDI has been experimenting with miniature projection systems which could then be placed inside of the faces of Audio-Animatronic figures that are used in the Disney theme parks. The Imagineers had previously used this technology with some success in Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin and The Haunted Mansion. But recent advances in the miniaturization of projection systems as well as LED lighting had now made this projected-from-within-face idea worth revisiting.\nAnd as soon as the Imagineers showed Staggs some prototypes that they'd been working on, Tom immediately said \"That's it. That's what we should be doing with the Dwarfs in Mine Train's big show scene.\" So even though New Fantasyland's centerpiece attraction had already been under construction for a year or more at this point, the Imagineers immediately shifted gears and began dreaming up ways to install Dwarf AA figures with projected-from-within-faces in this new family coaster.\nAnd because they wanted the Dwarfs to look just as they did in Disney's first full-length animated feature... Well, that's why the Imagineers reached out to Dave Bossert . Who's a Producer, Creative Director and Head of Special Projects at Walt Disney Animation Studios .\nNow Dave is one of the Mouse House's master magicians. If you watched Disney Night last month on ABC's Dancing with the Stars and then marveled at how Drew Carey danced with the Genie from Aladdin ... Well, it's Bossert's Special Projects team that did that. Likewise when Tom Hanks interacted with an animated Tinker Bell in Saving Mr. Banks , it was Bossert's talented group of animators & special effects artists who conjured up pixie dust that looked perfect for that particular period in Walt Disney Company history.''\nSo when it came to designing projected-from-within-faces for the Dwarf AA figures that would then be featured in the big show scene for New Fantasyland's family coaster, Dave and his team watched that 1937 film over & over. Looking for the specific ways that each of the Seven Dwarfs moved their eyes, eyebrows and mouths.\n\"A lot of this stuff was counter-intuitive. Take -- for example -- Sleepy. One of the ways that Disney's animators back in the 1930s indicated that this dwarf was actually asleep was by periodically having Sleepy open one eye,\" Bossert explained during a recent phone interview. \"Which is why we made sure that the face on the Sleepy Audio-Animatronic figure periodically opens one eye. Just so this character looks & acts just as Sleepy did in the original film.\"\n\"Nearly every piece of animation that you see in Seven Dwarfs Mine Train -- including the Dwarfs who dance on the ceiling on the spinning barrel room in this attraction's queue -- is all new. However, the silhouette animation of the Dwarfs at the final hill was a lift from the film and was our tip of the hat to the original property,\" Bossert stated. \"I'm just lucky enough to work with a team that's so talented, they can then replicate the precise look & performance of characters that were first animated nearly 80 years ago.\"\nWhich is why -- as WDW Guests have been getting off the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train during this New Fantasyland attraction's soft opening phase -- what have they been talking about? Not this family coaster's extremely smooth ride or how its oar cars full of passengers swing out to the side as they zoom along its 2000 foot-long track. No, what's got Central Florida tourists marveling is how great the Dwarfs look in Mine Train's big show scene. Which is why these AA figures are now considered to be the gold standard when it comes to replicating Disney characters in a dark ride environment.\nAnd that only happened because -- when it comes to Walt Disney Parks & Resorts -- good enough just ain't good enough.\nFollow Jim Hill on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jimhillmedia\nMore:\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nStudy online flashcards and notes for Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs..pdf ...

THOMAS INGE Abstract: Walt Disney stand.s in relation lo the twentieth cen- tury as the Brothers Grimm did to the nineteenth century. Dis- ney took their work, and the wntings of numerous other authors, and retold their tales through animation and fihn with such consumtnate skill that they became the modern deOnitive versions. A.s in the case ot\"5»(«r White and the Seven Dwarfs. Disney also reshaped the stories to reflect his vision of Amer- ican values. Key words: adaptation; animation; Brothers Grimm; Disney. Walt; fairy tales; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Walt Disney's decision to develop a feature-lengthanimated t1lm had a.s much to do with practicaleconomics as with his aesthetic interest in the newly developed possibilities of the art form. By the early 1930s, his studio artists were producing a da//Jing series of Academy Award-winning short.s featuring coordinated color and music as never before seen in animation. But the shttrts alone, despite their popularity and appeal lo theater managers. could not sustain the studio through the Depression years. Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and other film comedians were forced lo move lo feature-length productions to survive the hard times, so Disney decided to follow suit. The decision could not have been made without a sense of courage and confidence that Disney's artists, skilled in pro- ducing comic shorts of a few minutes duration, could stretch their talents to fill a screen for the usual ninetv minutes. Such Copyright retained by author This photo is from the stafje version of Snow White and (he Seven Dwarfs, written by Jessie Braham White, with music by Edmond Rickett, which opened on Broadway in 1912. The play ran for several years and was Ihe basis for the 1916 film that Wall Disney saw as a child. 132 a n d t h e S e v e n D w a r f s 133 134 JPF&T—Journal of Popular Film and Television astounding faith in himself and his workers also required exactly the right decision with regard to material. Dis- ney already had turned with frequency to traditional fairy tales, nursery rhymes, and children's stories for the \"Silly Symphony\" series, and he had even featured Mickey Mouse in abbre- viated versions of Gulliver's Travel.^ (1934) and Through the Looking Glass {1936). In a January 1933 appreciation of Disney, titled \"A New Art in the Making,\" the editor of The Art News suggested that Disney might turn to such classics of literature as Alice in Wonderland. or even Mohy-Dick, \"drawn and colored by Rockwell Kent.\" the most celebrated illustrator of Melville's novel (qtd. in Krause and Witkowski 9). Alice in Wonderland, of course, had never been far from Disney's mind and iinagination. His first succes,sful ani- mated shoils in 1924 were the scries o!\" \"Alice Comedies\" that featured a live child actor against an animated back- ground, althougii they had little to do with the Lewis Carroll classic. Bui in 1931 and again in 1933, two other stu- dios relea.sed their live-action versions of the story and thwarted Disney's plan to feature Mary Picklbrd in his produc- tion ct)mbining animation with live action. Other prospects Disney consid- ered doing in the same fashion included Washington Irving's Rip Van Winkle. long a popular vehicle of the stage and screen: L. Frank Baum's The Wondeiful Wizard of Oz. made into a play and a musical immediately after publication in 1900: and the widely loved Victor Herbert operetta of 1903. Babes in Toy- land. The rights to these properties were owned by other studios, and all negotiations with them failed, so Dis- ney had to turn elsewhere (Holliss and Sibley 5-7: Krause and Witkowski 17). The German fairy tales of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, first published in 1812 and translated into English by Edgar Taylor in 1823, already had pro- vided plot lines for several shorts, including Babes in the Woods (1932). based on the story of Hansel and Gre- tel. But the main reason offered by Disney for turning to \"Snow White\" was a sentimental one that had to do with a childhood experience. His earli- est memory of attending the motion pictures was when he and his news- paper-delivery colleagues were invited to a special screening of the 1916 Eamous Players and Lasky Coipora- tion silent version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The one-hour, eight- minute film featured Marguerite Clark. re-creating her role from the 1912 Broadway stage version, one of a series of such roles she played in child- oriented dramas. The screening was also noteworthy for its experiment in projection. The film was shown on four large screens simultaneously, although the intent of such an experiment re- screen animation the young Walt could have seen. The Queen orders the Hunter to kill Snow White and bring back her heart, but we already know from earlier scenes that Snow White is a friend of the Hunter's children and is not likely to be slain. She is abandoned in the woods, where she is stalked by a lion, even though there were no lions in Ger- many. Snow White is confronted by what appears to be a parrot or a large parakeet that leads her to the home of the Dwarfs. When they appear, we find that they all have different names, although only six are given: Bik. Blik, Frik. Fik. Snik. and Dik. They mine The [1916] film includes a brief and very poorly executed animated sequence of the witch in silhouette flying to her lair—probably the first screen animation the young Walt could have seen. mains obscure (Holliss and Sibley 6-7: Krause and Witkowski 17). Although the 1916 film follows the basic plot elements of the Grimm ver- sion, it also greatly expands on the original. For example, the Prince, here named Florimond, first sees Snow White when she is among a group of dancing girls at court. She has dressed as one of them. The Queen, interested in the handsome Prince for herself, is dismayed when she sees that he favors Snow White, so she sends him away. She turns for help to a witch with whom she has had previous com- merce, having asked the crone to give her a lengthy head of hair (the per- former playing the witch wears eye- glasses—an anachronism, of course— but so would the Disney witch in one of the earliest sketches of the character by a studio artist: reproduced in Hol- liss and Sibley 11). The film includes a brief and very poorly executed animat- ed sequence of the witch in silhouette Hying to her lair—probably the tlrst diamonds in a shaft, the entrance to which is inside their house. The good-hearted Hunter is jailed by the Queen for failing in his mis- sion, and the children are jailed in a separate cell (Disney would have the Prince imprisoned in an early version of his plot). Snow White's parrot appears on the windowsill with a cord he can use to bring his children up to his higher cell. The Queen meantime has had the witch turn her into an old crone who brings a poisoned comb to Snow White, who puts it in her hair and falls unconscious. A bunny rabbit shows up in the mines to call the Dwarfs back to revive Snow White (they .seem to understand rabbit lan- guage). The Queen later returns with a poisoned apple, which does the trick after one bite. The Hunter escapes prison with his children and travels to the kingdom of Prince Florimond to tell of the danger besetting Snow White. The Prince sets out to save her and discovers her in a Retrospectives: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 135 beautiful, flower-bedecked glass cof- iln surrounded by the Dwarfs. The Prince cairics the coffm to the court lo confront the Queen with the dead body. The piece of poisoned apple is dislodged from Snow White's throat. and she awakes to a happy life with her Prince Charming. The witch turns the Queen into a large-no.sed, ugly lady in waiting. She loses her long tresses, but Snow White spares her from any greater punishment. Despite these departure.s from and additions to the Grimm version, the 1916 nini bears many striking siTnilar- ities in detail to the version that Disney would ultimately produce. For exam- ple, when Snow White prepares dinner for the Dwarfs, who have separate names here if not distinct personali- ties, they wash up before the meal, a scene that Disney expanded into a full comic routine for his film. When tbe Dwarfs go to bed. they give one to Snow White, leaving them one short. They do a routine of bumping the next one out of bed until one is left without a place to sleep (like Dopey), so he cuddles up on the floor next U) Snow White. When the Dwarfs line up to march to the mines the next day. Snow White follows at the end. imitating their peculiar stiff step, but then she adds at the end a little hitch step very much like the one thai would charac- terize Dopey.' Also, before they begin marching. Snow White kisses the last one on the head, again as with Dopey in Disney's film. Although the evil Queen here is turned into an old hag by the witch rather than by her own wizardry, when she appears at the Dwarfs' cottage, she is framed in the window very much as in the same scene by Disney. She is also invited in by Snow White and offered a drink of water. This plot has reduced the original three visits of the disguised Queen to two (the poisoned comb and apple), just as Disney first intended, until he reduced the visits to one for dramatic economy. The rabbit that goes to the mines to retrieve the Dwarfs after Snow White has passed out from the poisoned comb is but one example of several scenes in which animals intervene in the action. Such interaction between humans and ani- mals, of course, would be t)ne of the noteworthy creative features of Dis- ney's film. There are other visual sim- ilarities, such as the Hunter who is dressed very much like Disney's with the same appearance and build or the beautiful glass coffin that holds the sleeping Princess. It is not possible to know how many of these similarities are attributable to coincidence and how many to distant childhood memories on the part of Dis- ney. One could argue, however, tbat he was as much inspired by this fihn as he was by any recent reading of the origi- nal Grimm text. We learned about this source only recently when a copy of the 1916 film turned up in the George East- man House collection and was acquired by the Disney Archives (actually a copy with Dutch title cards presumably pre- pared for European distribution). Although Disney claimed in a story conference on December 22. 1936, with reference to a trip made the pre- vious year—\"While I was in Europe. I went to various book stores and pur- chased copies of this story and brought them back with me\" (6)^wc do not know which translations or which edi- tions of the Grimm Brothers' version of \"Snow White\" he actually read. There is no indication in the story con- ference notes that he ever passed out copies to the staff, and none are found in what remains of his personal library. That he was conversant with the spe- cific details of the original Is clear, however, in his summary given on that same date: It's the kind oi' story thai you could wcite in two pages—in I'iiL-l it is only two or three p;iyes in the book. The theme of the thing is ihe jealousy of ihe stcp-inothcr. the Queen. She has this magic mirror to consult to see if she is the fairest in the land. She would resort to anything to keep herself the fairest in the land. Snow White was her step-daughter, and the Queen made a slave out of her lo keep her from look- ing beautiful. Sbc m;ide bcr work hard. One day when llie Queen consulted her mirror, tbe luirror said .Snow While was tbc fairest in ibe land, and of eourse the Queen had to do something about it— she was dreading tbat time. Tbe Queen called ber Huntsman in and had bim take Snow White oul inio Ibe woods and kill her. Tbc Huntsman let tbe girl go and be killed a pig and took tbe pig's beart and carried il to tbc Queen. Again tbe Queen consulted ber magic mirror and found oul tbal Snow White still lived. Sbe tben resolved to disguise ber- self and go oul and kill Snow White. Tbe Queen had a sanctuary wbere sbe used to practice Ibis wiiehcrafl. She had all kinds of lortnulas and poisons whicb she concocted. Tbe Queen disguised berself as a peddlar woman and went out tbree times to kill Snow Wbile. Tbe tu'sl time sbe used a corset, the second, a aimb. and the third, un apple. (In our version of ibis story, we only bave the Queen going out once.) The Queen wenl oul three different times and tried to kill her: of course every time tbe dwarfs left Snow Wbite in tbe morning, tbey warned ber aboul ibe old Queen. Each time tbe Queen came lo kill Snow Wbite. tbe dwarfs arrived home just in time to loosen the corset or take tbe comb oul of her hiiir. However, ihe tbird time tbe Queen came lo kill Snow Wbite. sbe brougbt ber a poisoned apple, and Snow White bad already taken a bite out of it. and il was loo late wben tbe dwarfs came bome—tbey couki do iHitbing about it. Tbese dwarfs were very sad. and Snow' Wbite was so beautiful in death tbat they built ber a coftin of glass and gold. They built a beautiful shrine on tbe bill and kept eternal vigil until the Prince appeared. He came to investigate and was going to take her awiiy because she was so beautifid. Wbile be was car- rying ihe coffin, he jarred it. and the apple dropped out of her nioutb and she immediately came to life. Wben they bad their wedding, they invited tbe old Queen and made her dance in ber shoes until sbe was dead. This was toid in straight narrative. This covers a few pages in a book and has been translated in evety language. . . . In our \\ersion of tbis story, we fol- lowed tbe story very closely. We have put in certain twists to make it more log- ical, more convincing and easy to swal- low. We have taken the characters and haven't added any. We have tbe Queen, the Mirror, tbe Prince, tbe Huntstiian. Snow Wbite and tbe Seven Dwarfs. The only ihing we bave built in the story are the animals who are friends of Snow White's. Tbis wasn't in the original fairy tale. We bave developed a person- ality in tbe mirror and comic personali- ties of the Seven Dwarfs. (5-6) Disney then followed this with a lengthy 5.600-word, highly detailed summary of the film, encompassing what had been done and what remained 136 JPF&T—Journal of Popular Film and Television to be finished exaclly one year before its scheduled premiere. This must have been not unlike his famous first enact- ment of the plot ft) his full staff a year and a half earlier in mid-1935. It also suggests just how firmly the entire film. from the storybook opening to the final shot of the huppy ending, was implant- ed in Disney's mind. Disney takes note here of various changes he has intentionally made— reducing the Queen's visits from three to one. adding the animals friendly to Snow White, and giving personalities to the mirror and the individual Dwarfs. But the actual changes are far more numerous and profound than he indicated on this occasion or any other. The following is an outline of dele- tions or alterations made in the process of adapting the Grimm text: GRIMM: The opening paragraph pro- vides background on Snow White's mother and the mother's subsequent death, presumably from childbii'th. DlSNHY: Snow White's origin was omitted fR)ni the film for dramatic expediency, although early scenarios and sketches included it. Many of Dis- ney's book versions based on the film included this background and even a portiait of the Queen mother looking out her window at a snow storm as she embroiders (reproduced in Holliss and Sibley81). GRIMM: The King remarries and the vain stepmother, who consults her omniscient mirror, is reassured that she is the most beautiful as long as Snow White is an infant. DISNEY: The King is deleted entirely, but the Queen is fully developed in all her vainglory, and the mirror is given a masculine personality as a commenta- tor on the status of her beauty. GRIMM: Snow White matures at the age of seven and at last rivals and excels the beauty of the Queen, as revealed to her by the mirror. DiSNi-v: The age of Snow White, given the romantic context, had to be moved upward, fourteen being the most frequently mentioned possibility, and when Disney began his search for someone to speak and sing the role of Snow White, he advertised for a '•[flourteen-year-old voice\" (Krause and Witkowski 27. 29). GRIMM: The Queeti's envy grows day by day at the sight of Snow White around the palace. DI-SNEY: The jealous Queen requires Snow White to perform scullery work and dress in rags (perhaps boirowing an idea from the tale of Cinderella). GRIMM: The Queen orders the Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest, kill her. and bring back as proof her lungs and liver. Di.sMiY: The Queen asks for Snow White's heart in a casket, a more sym- bolic choice. GRIMM: The Huntsman reveals his purpose, and Snow White pleads for her life. He relents out of pity but also cynically reminds bimself that she will probably be devoured by wild animals anyway. DLSNHY: Dagger poised, the tender- hearted Huntsman relents and tells Snow White to flee into the woods. GKIMM: The Huntsman brings back the lungs and liver of a young boar, which the Queen boils and cats, engaging she believes in ritual canni- balism. DlSNHY: The Huntsman brings back the heart of a boar and the potential cannibalism is deleted. GRIMM: Snow White is frightened in the forest, and although the wild beasts come near her, they do her no harm. DISNHY: The forest appears fright- ening at tlrst, but it is all in Snow White's imagination as what appear to be threatening eyes turn out to be those of the benign creatures of the forest. GRI.MM: Snow White, alone, stum- bles on the cottage of the Dwarfs in the forest. DISNEY: The friendly animals lead Snow White to the cottage when she indicates that she needs a place to sleep for the night. GRIMM: Inside the cottage all is clean and dainty, the dinnerware is laid out, and dinner prepared. Snow White eats some of the food and falls asleep in the only bed of the seven suited to her size. DISNEY: Inside the cottage, all is dirty and disorganized, so with the help of the animals. Snow Wbite per- forms a major cleaning and prepares dinner; she thinks that a group of chil- dren lives there. After all this work, she falls asleep across several of the diminutive beds. GRIMM: The Dwarfs return to the cottage after a day in the mountains digging for gold ore and minerals. DISNEY: The Dwarfs return from their mine in the mountains after dig- ging for diamonds, rubies, and other precious stones. GRIMM: When they discover things have been disturbed, the Dwarfs fol- low a routine similar to the pattern of \"The Three Bears.\" each asking a question. '\"Who's been sitting in my chair?\" \"Who's been eating from my plate?\" and so on. Except for this, the Dwarfs are not given .separate person- alities. DISNEY: The Dwarfs are startled to discover things so clean. They believe a monster is in the cottage and creep upstairs to discover Snow White. After she wakes, she learns of their separate names and identities and reaches an agreement with them that if they let her stay, she will cook and keep house for them. GRIMM: Because she is so beautiful, the Dwarfs do not wake Snow White and allow her to stay the night. In the morning, they learn her story and offer an agreement that they will protect her if she will keep house for them. DISNEY: They all go down to dinner, where Snow White tutors them in cleanliness and manners before eating. A party with music and dancing fol- lows the dinner, and Snow White entertains them with a story and a song about her dream Prince, whom she met one day while scrubbing the courtyard in the palace. Then they all retire for the night. GRIMM: The Dwarfs go off to work after warning Snow White not to allow anyone else in the cottage, because sooner or later the Queen will try to kill her again. DISNEY: The Dwarfs march to the mines after a similar warning. Retrospectives: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 137 GRIMM: The mirror reveals to the Queen that Snow While still lives and is with the Dwarfs. The Queen decides to carry out the murder t)n her own: First, disguised as a peddlar wt)man. she offers Snow White a corset tied so tight her breath is cut off: second, she turns to witchcraft to produce a poisoned comb that she offers under another dis- guise; and finally, she goes to a hidden chamber to produce a poisoned apple, again offered under a final disgui.se. The first two times, the Dwarfs reiiini to revive Snow White, but the final time, they assume she is dead. DLSNHY: The Queen, angry over the Huntsman's failure as revealed by the mirror, descends to her dungeon to mix a magic potion, which turns her into an ugly witch. Turning to her witchcraft book on poisons, she fash- ions an apple that will put Snow White in a death-like coma, love's first kiss being the only antidote. At first, Dis- ney intended to use two visits with the poist)ned comb and the apple, but dra- matic pacing required only one visit {someone overlooked the fact that ihe final page of the book shown at the very end of the film still carried a dec- oration of a comb with strands of hair in it [Holliss and Sibley 8-9]). GRIMM: Efforts to revive Snow White fail, so the Dwarfs prepare to bury her, but she is still so beautiful even in death that they place her in a glass coffin on top of a mountain where animals keep vigil. DlSNi;Y: The animals, seeing that Snow White is in danger, frantically retrieve the Dwarfs from the mines. They airive in lime io pursue the witch who slips off the edge of a cliff to her death when it is .struck by a bolt of lightning during a stt>rm. The mourn- ing Dwarfs place Snow White in a glass coffin and keep vigil at her side along with the animals. GRIMM: A Prince happens to pass through the forest, sees the beautiful maiden in the coffin, and persuades the Dwarfs to let him carry it with him Io his kingdom. When they stumble over a shrub while carrying the coffin, the piece of apple is dislodged from Snow White's throat, and she awakens to the arms and a declaration of love from the Prince. DISNEY: The Prince, already loved by Snow White, arrives in his search for her, raises the lid of the coffin, and offers love's first kiss. She awakens with great delight to bis arms as the animals and Dwarfs rejoice at the res- urrection. The idea of the kiss to awak- en the princess may have been bor- rowed from the story of Sleeping Beauty (although it also had been used in a forty-minute version of Suow White in 1913 | Holliss and Sibiey 6]). GRIMM: The wedding feast is attended by the wicked and now furi- ously jealous Queen, who is forced to dance in red-hot iron shoes until she drops to the ground dead. DiSNKY: The Queen falls to her death from a precipice during a storm, and the wedding is deleted. Marguerite Clarke starred as Snow White in both the 1912 Broadway play ikiid 1916 film uf Snow While and the Seven Dwarfs. Clarke made a fiircer ol' plajiny such dnuiias for children and was still portraying Snow White as late as 1925. L ike most fairy tales, the basic plotstructure of the story of \"Snow White\" can be found in hundreds of variants collected by folklorists in Europe. Asia, Africa, and North and South America, many of which pre- date the Grimm version. They al! tend to follow the same basic structure of nine episodes: \"origin {birth of hero- ine), jealousy, expulsion, adoption, renewed jealousy, death, exhibition, resuscitation, and resolution\" (Tatar. Cla.s.sic Fairy Tales 74). If we place the Disney version in this tradition, we see that he has made only one major change in the structure: that of delet- ing the first element, the birth of Snow White and Ihe death of her mother. This was a decision made late in the process and presumably so as lo ct)]ne more directly lo the basic conflict and action. A birlh and death scene would 138 ,|PF&T—Journal of Popular Film and Television have provided little opportunity for effective animation too, not to mention the difUculty of establishing a proper lone Tor a film meani to be entertain- ing with an immediate sad scene. There were plenty of technical and dramatic Justifications for this dele- tion, but the remainder of the tradi- tional structure was maintained. Thus, Disney's version is a legitimate variant in the \"Snow White\" cycle of tales. The changes in detail Disney did make fall under a variety of categories having to do with creating an effective and engaging film, using the full poten- tial of the new art of animation, and making a version suitable for an Amer- ican audience in the first part of the twentieth century. It would have to be a film that children would enjoy enough to sit still for almost ninety minutes and that adults would find engaging enough to sit through it with ihem. The adults, after all. controlled ihe money, and these were Depression years when little was left for family diversion. The film would have to maintain the Disney Stu- dio's tradition for safe, family enter- tainment that amused and edified and that demonstrated the creative knack for being at the forefront of new tech- niques and challenges in film anima- tion. Everyone loved what genericaily came to be known as \"Mickey Mouse cartoons.\" and the studio was not about to barter away any of its public atfec- tion and support for an ill-developed and controversial project. Some changes were simply a matter of common sense, such as changing Snow White's age from seven to about fourteen or older. Other illogicalities of the original plot, however, were apparently never questioned—the dis- appearance of Snow White's father. the King; why there were no female Dwarfs; whether the Seven Dwarfs were brothers: how or where the Dwarfs marketed the minerals or pre- cious stones they dug from the earth; and, given her all-consuming vanity and concern for beauty, how the Queen could have allowed herself to be disguised or turned into a horribly ugly old hag. But the plots of fairy tales are not to be analyzed in terms of logic or rationality. A few changes had to do with dra- matic pacing, such as omitting the birth of Snow White, reducing the three visits of the disguised Queen to only one, and not including a fmal wedding scene, which could only be anticllmactic to the revival by love's first kiss. Others had to do with dra- matic engagement—that is creating more interest in the characters or plot through audience sympathy and involvement—such as making Snow White into a scullery maid, bringing in the Prince at the beginning, giving the mirror a personality, making the Huntsman sincerely sympathetic. depicting the cottage as disorderly and the Dwarfs in need of motherly atten- tion, having them mine diamonds and precious stones rather than minerals, and substituting a kiss for the dislodg- ment of a piece of poisoned apple (the sight of a princess throwing up would not be very appealing). The additions and expansions to the Grimm text were mostly intended to allow the animators to exercise their newly discovered skills and tech- niques in filling the screen with lively and humorous activity, as in the clean- ing of the Dwarfs' cottage, the sequence when the Dwarfs wash their hands before dinner, or the after-din- ner parly with lots of movement and music. This would have been true as well of several scenes finally cut because they did not further the plot, such as a soup-eating sequence during dinner or the Dwarfs building a special bed for Snow While as a gift. Although a few animals were men- tioned in the original story—the wild beasts thai brush against Snow White when she first enters the woods, and the owl, raven, and dove that come to mourn her death—the fuller interven- tion of animals afforded the animators an opportunity to do what they had done best in the short films before Snow While and the Seven Dwarfs: cre- ate a host of anthropomorphic creatures that totally engaged the young and many of the older views too. At least one reviewer of Snow White and the Seven Dwurfs after its New York release, critic Mark Van Doren, espe- cially complimented this aspect of the film. He found the use of animals \"indescribably delightful\" and noted, \"I can remember no finer moment in any film ihan this one when al sunrise in the forest the banks of eyes which have looked so sinister all night turn out to belong to rabbits, fawns, chipmunks. bluebirds, and turtles. The transition is from shadowy evil to the clearest and most blithesome benevolence\" (108). Too cute and cuddly for other Disney crilics. in future films the animals would prove to be the bread and butter for the success of the Studio and the merchandising of Disney properties. The major challenge to the anima- tors resulted from the desire to give the Dwarfs separate personalities. It would have been much easier to cre- ate seven generic Dwarfs all acting and reacting in the same way. Giving them names and personalities required the development and mainte- nance of consistent attitudes and actions throughout the film and dur- ing their interchanges with each other and Snow White. It also meant that when all seven were on screen, which was much of the time, anywhere the viewers looked they would find a par- ticular Dwarf in character reacting on the basis of his own defined personal- ity, just as would be true in a live- action film. This provided the full animation screen with a degree of activity and comic engagement unlike anything moviegoers had seen before. Except for mood-setting scenes, con- stant activity marked the narrative progress. The most obvious changes were intended to tone down the violence of the original tale. What were supposed to be Snow While's lungs and liver in a casket were replaced by her heart, the Queen's ritual cannibalism was deleted, and the honible death of the Queen from dancing in red-hot slippers was replaced by a more dramatic ending. In fact, her death was not only more dra- matic but more poetically just in that she was not stricken down by another hand but more appropriately by the forces of nature she had tried to bend to her own wicked ends through witch- craft. Rather than cause the innocents to be expelled from the Garden of Eden, Retrospectives: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 139 in this case the forbidden apple leads to a restoration of paradise. But there are plenty of frightening elements left in the film to unsettle the viewer, especially a young one; the abandonment of Snow White by her parent, albeit a stepmother; the image of Ihe Huntsman with knife upraised over Snow White; the haunted forest with spooks we are relieved to discov- er are benign or natural; the transfor- mation of the Queen into the wicked wilch in her laboratory; the witch's plan to see Snow White effectively buried alive, one of the basic human fears; and the striking death of the witch as all the sound and fury of nature crashes around her. Any one of these has been known to send a child running from the theater or to invest a young viewer with several nightmares. Only the death of Bambi's mother would do that more effectively. In Great Britain. South Africa, and the Netherlands, Snow While and ihe Seven Dwarfs was rated as unsuitable for small children and parfially banned or altered because of these scenes iHolliss and Siblcy 66; Makin 31). The frightening elements of the story were modified or adjusted, in any case, to a more sensitive or sensible level, not entirely banished, as some critics would claim. In cinematic terms. Snow While and ihe Seven Dwarfs was a resounding success and a landmark in animation history. Realistic and smooth human actions were successfully combined with caricature and exaggeration for the first time. A full range of cinemat- ic techniques usually found only in live-action films—close-up shots, a moving camera, zooming, and so on— were impressively applied to anima- tion. Like any film at its best, it evokes a variety of responses in the audi- ence—happiness, laughter, sadness, fear, and horror. It has a fully devel- oped plol with a conflict that pits good and innocence against Jealousy and evil, with a firm resolution on the side of justice. Like all fairy tales, it is a story of fear and survival. In a short essay on the art of adapta- tion, Disney once claimed, ''a film ver- sion can give wider scope and even add characters without damage to the origi- nal tale. . . . In every case, no matter what form we choose lo tell a story, we always hold its author in the highest respect. We do our utmost to keep the qualities that have made his tale immortal\" (317). Yet one of his harshest critics. Frances Clark Sayers, would charge, \"What 1 deplore about Mr. Dis- ney is his tendency to take over a piece of wt)rk and make it his own without any regard for the original author of the original book\" (119). The mediating balance not recognized bclween ibese extreme statements, neither of which is entirely true, is ihe need to make a good film. Things thai work on paper do noi work on the screen and vice versa, and the fmal imperative is to adjust the orig- inal source in the direction of effective psychological and cultural importance has been the heaviest charge made against the Disney version. Child psy- chologist Bruno Bettelheim. in bis groundbreaking study The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaninf> and Importance of Fairy Talc^. charged that Disney and other film adapters pro- duced \"fairy tales only in prettified and simplified versions which subdue and rob them of all deeper significance\" (24). He read \"Snow White\" as another version of ihe Oedipal myth: \"The stt)ry deals essentially with the Oedipal con- flicts between nn)ther and daughter; with childhood; and tlnally with ado- ie.scence, placing major emphasis on what constitutes a good childhood, and what is needed to grow out of it\" (202). The Dwaifs, it seems, are a part of that Faithfulness to the art of filmmaking is more important than faithfulness to the text, and the principles of evaluation should be cinematic, not literary. emai and creative filmmaking. As the story conference notes indicate, it was film images and pers{-)nalities, not literary sources, that played on the imagination of the artists as they made decisions about the shape and naiure of Snow White and the Seven Dwaifs. Comedi- ans such as Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin. Will Rogers, Harry Langdon, and W. C. Fields influenced the person- alities of the various Dwarfs, and popu- lar films of 1931 and 1932, such as Dracula. Chandit the Magician, and Dr JekyU and Mr Hyde, are mentioned for the atmosphere and sets surround- ing the Queen, her throne room, and her dungeon laboratory. Faithfulness to the ail of filmmaking is more important than faithfulness to the text, and the principles of evaluation should be cine- matic, not literary. Adaptation to new aesthetic, geo- graphic, national, and cultural contexts is al the heart of survival for the fairy tale anyway. But betrayal of the fairy tale of \"Snow White\" and its deepest project as stunled phalluses that \"sym- bolize an immature pre-individual form of existence which Snow White must transcend\" (210). Giving them individ- ual personalities, then. Bettelheim believed, seriously interfered with chil- dren's •\"unconscious understanding\" (2I0)of the tale. Feminist crilics Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar shift the ground some- what by viewing the struggle between Snow White and her stepmother as enacting \"the essential but equivocal relationship between the angel-woman and the monster-woman\" of the male imagination (36). in which the wicked Queen becomes the more admirable character because of her aggressive. independent behavior. Taking this one step fuither, Maria Tatar notes. \"The Disney version of 'Snow White' relent- lessly polarizes the notion of the femi- nine to produce a murderously jealous and forbiddingly cruel woman on the one hand and an innocently sweet girl accomplished in the aii ot good house- 140 JPF&T—Journal of Popular Film and Television with the letter but had never tampered with the spirit of the tales, just as they repeatedly asserted the essential con- tours of each folktale plot remained intact, comparisons of successive edi- tions of Nursery and Household Tales suggest that the Grimms were either disingenuous, dishonest, or engaging in self-deception when they made such declarations\" (24). It turns out that they completely rewrote, sanitized, and altered the texts to suit their own lime and cultural contexts to make them suitable for nineteenth-century children and general readers. The tales are liter- ary creatit)ns in iheir own right, and the Grimm Brothers adapted them so well and witb such literary skill that, for a Disney during his lifetime reveals that certain themes and values form recur- ring patterns. These include an alle- giance to agrarian values and democra- tic patriotism; a belief in the .self- reliance, individualism, and work ethic that stand behind the American dream; and an emphasis on the stability of the home and loyalty to family. Several of these themes show up in Snow White and the Seven Dwaifs-—^the animals are told to \"whistle while you work\" when they help Snow White clean up the Dwarfs' cottage, and the Dwaifs sing \"Heigh-ho, heigh-ho. It's off to work we go\" to dig in tbe mines, not for prof- it but because it's \"what we like to do.\" Perhaps Depression-weary Americans keeping on the other\" {Classic Fairy Tales 78). Thus, old prejudices are con- firmed and little of a positive nature can result from Disney's adaplalion. Totally untutored in Freud or any olher psychological theory and neces- sarily unaware of what folklorists. anthropologists, psychiatrists, femi- nists, and literary theorists would reveal about fairy and folk tales, Disney and his animators had no idea they were traipsing on sacred ground. When Time magazine queried Disney about the meaning of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at the time of its reiea.se. he replied. \"We just iry and make a good picture. And then the professors come along and tell us whal we do\" (\"Mouse and Man\" 21). This they have done in spades but usually as if Disney had violated some canonical text engraved in stone. His intentions were simple in terms of meaning, as he noted in the story conference quoted above; \"The theme of this thing is the jealousy of the step- mother, the Queen\" (.-)). He was not g |opg tradition in W e s t e m culture of portray- being disingenuous. Intentionally or not, however, he was stepping into a culturally and psychologically charged mine field by choosing to adapt the story of \"'Snow White.\" and he may be held accountable for whatever meanings with which he may have invested the traditional tale. A good deal of the response on the pail of Bettelheim and others seemed lo presume the existence of some sort of standard version, an Urtext. against which to measure Disney's version. As the mosl widely known, this more often than not turned out to be the Grimm Brothers' version in one or more of its various translations, especially given that Disney claimed it as his source. For a long time, we assumed the venerable German philologists had collected their tales and faithfully recorded them directly from the mouths of the folk and that their stories stood as authentic extensions of the German national character and identity. But scholars have proved different in recent decades. As Maria Tatar has concluded in her study The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Faijy Tales. \"'Although the brothers insisted that ihey may have tinkered Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs accurately reflected the general public attitude toward the place of women in society and continued ing women as passive vessels of innocence and virtue. century at least, their versions of \"Snow White.\" \"'Cinderella^ and \"\"Hansel and Grelel\" were considered the definitive and best-known versions. Their ideolo- gy emanates from the authors and not the German folk mind. D isney stands in relation to thetwentieth century as the Brothers Grimm did to the nineteenth century. He took their work and the writings of numerous olher authors and taletellers and retold their stories through anima- lion and film with such consummate skill that he made them the modern definitive versions and the best-known ones worldwide. At the same time, he reshaped the stories such that they reflected his vision of American social and ethical values. Like all his films. Snow While and the Seven Dwaifs was invested with a distinct ideology. A suiTey of the films completed under the direction and influence of were encouraged to learn \"It ain't no trick / To get rich quick / If ya' dig-dig- dig / With a shovel or a pick\" (Holliss and Sibley 48-49). Snow White demonstrates a high degree of resource- fulness and self-reliance when she struggles to survive in the forest and makes herself useful to the Dwarfs. On the other hand, the Queen takes her individualism and independence to an extreme, and because of her vanity she moves beyond the rules of civil society to narcissistic self-destruction. Perhaps like F Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby, she demonstrates how a dream (to be the most beautiful woman in the king- dom) can be conupted when she con- eludes that the end justifies the means, and both are willing to murder on behalf of their dreams. The primary value that informs Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, however, is an allegiance to the home and family. Disney's biographer Retrospectives: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 141 Steven Watts has noted. \"Disney car- ried out of boyhood a great fondness for a big family full of warmth and happiness, a feeling largely shaped by his own family's lack of such quali- ties\" (14), with reference to the strained relations between Disney and his father and the difficult times the children experienced under his stern paternalism. An emphasis on the fam- ily as a source of social cohesion would lead Disney to what Watts called \"the Disney Doctrine: a notion that the nuclear family, with its atten- dant rituals of marriage, parenthood. emotional and spiritual instruction. and consumption, was the centerpiece of the American way of life\" (326). Although done for dramatic reasons rather than (hematic intent, the omis- sion of Snow White's birth and the death of her mother brought the focus to bear on her subsequent dysfunction- al family—a totally absent father and an overbearing, jealous stepmother. Only the presence of the Huntsman provides any sort of male-oriented fatherly compassion. The male voice of the mirror remains neutral and objective, although the Queen must turn to this masculine gaze for affir- mation of her self-worth based on superficial appearances. It is an unnat- ural family that finally turns to infanti- cide as a means of resolving tensions and conflicts. When Snow White comes to stay with the Dwarfs, her first Impulse is to treat them like children, assume the role of the mother, and create a sense of domestic harmony. She agrees to fulfill the role of housewife if they agree to work and support what forms essentially a family unit. Whereas Doc appears to be the leader of the group. given his intelligence. Grumpy aciual- ly takes on a more fatherly role in his initial reluctance to have anything to do with domesticity. He was like many of the stereotypical romantic leads in the films of Hollywood at the time— men who resisted marriage until they discovered their true feelings beneath a superficial masculine avoidance of commitment that characterized the male image. Grumpy is no Jimmy Stewart. Cary Grant, or Spencer Tracy. but like them, he comes around when he yields to the charms of innocence, beauty, and domesticity. Although her animus is mainly against Snow White, the Queen also takes obvious delight in disturbing and destroying the stable family the Princess has created with her adopted children. But the Dwarfs cannot substitute for the genuine article, a husband, and this requires the return of the Prince. In the early story meeting notes. Snow White was envisioned as a \"Janet Gaynor\" type and the Prince was \"Douglas Fairbanks,\" both highly popular romantic film figures of the time (Krause and Witkowski 20). As in most Hollywood romantic comedies, the Prince arrives to rescue Snow White and literally carry her off on his white horse to marriage and a new life together. No doubt a family will fol- low, the Dwarfs will visit as adopted uncles of the children, and domestic security will pievail. The narrative impulse and urge of the entire film is toward family stability and social cohesion. Gi\\en Disney's attitude and belief sysiem, this happened naturally and inevitably and would happen again in many more films to come. From our perspective, given the rad- ical redefinitions of family in the past few decades, the creation of the increasingly ubiquitous \"extended fam- ily\" as a result of divorce, as well as the influence of feminism in changing pub- lic attitudes toward the roles of women. Snow Whiw and the Seven Dwcufs appears old fashioned and reactionary. Kay Stone has taken both the Grimms and Disney to task for popularizing heroines who are \"not only passive and pretty, but also unusually patient, obe- dient, industrious, and quiet\" (44). On the re-release of Snow Whire ami the Seven Dwa)fs in 1993, as journalist Jami Bernard put it, the film has returned \"just in time to mess up a new generation of little girls.\" The real prob- lem is the song \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\"—\"eminently humniable, ennobling the virtues of passivity and pre-determined happy endings. Snow White . . . has merely to wait prettily, because someday her prince will come, someday she'll find her love. That song sets up little girls for a lifetime of fever- ish romantic expectations that don't easily mix with the jungle out there that is the modern dating scene\" (H3). Ber- nard is overstating the case. One rather suspects that given the environment in which young women are raised today, wilh the active encouragement they receive to pursue careers as well as marriage and family, very few are like- ly to be lulled into the notion that pas- sivity breeds success. The cosmetics and fashion industries probably do more to encourage the idea that the key to success is beauty or appearance than any film more than sixty years old. Snow Wlute and the Seven Dwaifs on this score is very much a part of its original time and place. It accurately reflected the general public attilude toward the place of women in society and continued a long tradition in West- ern culture of portraying women as passive vessels of innocence and virtue, although Disney's Snow White shows a good deal more spunk than most fairy tale princesses. The facts of Disney's own life suggest that he was not always easy around women. Dis- ney's father seems to have been a stern and forbidding man, litlle given to affection; he was undermined by the mother, who was pliant and supportive of young Walt's independence. In fact, she agreed to let him alter his birth date, and she signed his father's signa- ture on an official document so Walt could serve in the Red Cross Ambu- lance Corps during World War I (Watts 10). In his twenties, he spent little time dating, primarily because he lacked money and was a workaholic anyway. He manied one of the first women with whom he fell in love, and Lillian appears to have happily accepted the traditional rotes of housewife and mother. By Hollywood standards cer- tainly, the Disney's marriage was happy, faithful, and uneventful. Although a good many women were employed at the Disney Studios, most of them worked in the eel inking and painting department, because it was felt that their artistic inclinations were better suited to copying and painting rather than creating or animating. One excep[it)n was Mary Blair, who 142 JPF&T—Journal of I'oputar Film and Television worked as an art director and designer on numerous films in the 1940s and 1950s and designed the \"It's a Small World\" exhibit originally for the 1964 World's Fair. In general. Disney was a man of his age and expressed no par- ticular discontent with established gender attitudes and roles, although he was opposed to racism and ethnic stereotyping. It would be a long time after his death before the Studio, working under the shadow of his influ- ence, would begin to adjust its gender attitudes, indeed not obviously until Beauty and the Beast in 1991. Some would argue that just two years before, in The Little Mermaid and Pretty Woman, the studio still was unenlight- ened about the portrayal of women. The power and importance of Snow While and the Seven Dwarfs does not reside in any challenge to accepted mores. It is to be admired as a piece of cinematic art, a miraculous bringing together of collaborative talents under the guiding intelligence of a creative genius to produce a film that continues to charm and engage generation after generation of new viewers. It does no violence to the traditional patterns of meaning of the original fairy tale but rather renews and affirms the rele- vance of the story for another century. In this and later films. Disney was a major interpreter and conservator of Western culture and values for twenti- eth-century Americans, and to a large extent the world. Few artists, writers. or cultural figures had a more pro- found impact on the popular imagina- tion than did Walt Disney, and his work would define both the potential and limits of film animation until the end of the century and beyond.

According to animator Frank Thotn- as, he first drew the sequence in which Dopey fell out of step and did a little hitch step to catch up. He reported, \"Wall said. 'Hey. ihat's good—we ought use that all the way through ihe picture'\" (Culhane 118), which created frustration among other animators who now had to go back and reanimate Dopey up to that poinl. But the first mention of Ihe hitch step I found in the story meeting notes for Snow White and the Seven Dwarf's was by Disney him- self on October 2, 1936: \"You see them march out. Cut ahead to Doc. He is oul there. He sees them and turns around into the march—steps back and steps forward, moving right into it after marching in place for a couple of steps. Dopey is wait- ing for the last—when it is his turn he steps into il, but out of step and always trying to get in as they go off. I think you ought to do ihat all through ihe picture. He never can get into step. He does a skip when he gels in and he gets out again. When they send him out lo wash it's the same thing\" (3). Disney mentions Dopey's ••funny little step\" later in the notes for the same dale (6) and again in the notes for November 2, 1936(1 I). WORKS CITED Bernard.

Seven Dwarfs Mine Train - The Mickey Wiki: Your Walt Disney World Encyclopedia!\nSeven Dwarfs Mine Train\nThe largest drop on the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train\nMagic Kingdom\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\nFastPass +\nThe Seven Dwarfs Mine Train is an attraction located in Fantasyland .\nContents\n6 References\nHistory\nThe Seven Dwarfs Mine Train was initially announced on January 18, 2011 as part of the updated plans for the Fantasyland Expansion [1] . At this time, Disney explained that the attraction would feature a \"first-of-its kind ride system with a train of ride vehicles that swing back and forth as they whisk along the track\" [1] . In conjunction with the plans for New Fantasyland, Disney further announced that the dark ride attraction Snow White’s Scary Adventures would be closing on May 31, 2012, in order to make way for Princess Fairytale Hall [2] . This closure left the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train as the park’s sole representation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\nConstruction on the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train's track began in September 2012 [3] . During the construction of the attraction, Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Tom Staggs asked Imagineering if they could increase the quality of the Seven Dwarfs Audio Animatronics. Walt Disney Imagineering then decided to use new projection mapping technology to give the Dwarfs more realistic looking facial movements [4] . In order to make then Dwarfs as similar to the movie as possible, Walt Disney Animation's Special Projects team watched the 1937 Disney movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs over and over. The team then animated the characters for the new attraction [4] .\nThe Seven Dwarf Mine Train soft opened in New Fantasyland on May 21, 2014 [5] , with the official opening taking place one week later on May 28, 2014. On hand for the festivities were Snow White and Seven Dwarfs, as well as Orlando Magic basketball players Victor Oladipo and Tobias Harris [6] .\nAttraction Plot\nSneezy inside the Seven Dwarf's diamond mine.\nQueue\nThe Seven Dwarfs Mine Train queue begins with guests walking through the forest outside of the mine. After making their way through the outdoor portion of the queue, guests reach the first interactive area. In this covered section, guests can play a digital game where they sort gems which are floating along a trough. In another nearby interactive area, guests can place their hands under water spouts, creating a colored stream of water that also plays a musical note. Using the twelve notes, guests can play a tune from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Entering the interior part of the queue, guests reach the third interactive area. Here they can spin barrels of jewels to reveal projections of Doc and the other dwarfs on the ceiling. The faster guests spin the barrels, the more active the projections on the ceiling become. After traveling through the indoor section of the queue, guests reach the loading area.\nMusic Heard in the Queue [7]\nIn the attraction’s queue area, guests can hear instrumental versions of the music from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The music was rerecorded in a way that makes it sound like the Dwarfs themselves are playing the songs [8] . The songs heard in the queue include:\n\"I'm Wishing\"\n\"With A Smile And A Song\"\n\"Whistle While You Work\"\nDopey inside the Seven Dwarfs' Mine\n\"The Silly Song\"\n\"Someday My Prince Will Come\"\n\"Music In Your Soup\"\n\"You're Never Too Old\"\nRide\nAfter reaching the loading area, guests board mine cars that appear to have been made by the Dwarfs. The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train features a brand new ride system that allows guests to “tilt” their car left and right. This feature gives guests the swaying feeling that they would experience in mine car.\nThe attraction begins with guests leaving the loading area and moving outdoors, before going up the attraction’s first lift. As two vultures look on from above, the train begins to wind its way through the forest and around the mine. Next, the train slows down as guests enter the Seven Dwarf's Mine. Here, the Dwarfs can be seen lollygagging as they dig for jewels. Continuing on, guest see the five o’clock alarm go off and Doc begins to sing Heigh-Ho. After Doc's opening yodel, the other Dwarfs join in the song. Along the right hand wall of the mine, guests can see the silhouettes of the Dwarfs as they head home from work.\nAt this point in the attraction, guests head back outside. Here they go down the attraction's largest drop before continuing their winding decent. Finally, the trains pass the Dwarf's cottage where the Dwarfs can be seen performing the Yodel Song with Snow White. As the groups celebrates inside the cottage, the evil Queen can be seen outside the front door cackling, as she is about to give Snow White a poison apple. After passing by the cottage scene, guests arrive at the unload area.\nSee the Attraction!\nCast [9]\nThe vultures found on the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train were formerly located inside Snow White's Scary Adventures.
