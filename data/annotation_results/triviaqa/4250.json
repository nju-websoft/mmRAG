What goes up the chimney down but cannot go down the chimney up? | Reference.com\nWhat goes up the chimney down but cannot go down the chimney up?\nA:\nQuick Answer\nAccording to Riddle Spot, the answer to the riddle \"What goes up the chimney down but cannot go down the chimney up?\" is an umbrella. An umbrella is very thin and narrow when it is down, so it can fit through the narrow opening of a chimney. When an umbrella is up, however, it is too large to fit through the same narrow opening.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nWhat can go up a chimney down, but not down a chimney up? ... Up a Chimney Down | Katherine Wikoff Up a Chimney Down | Katherine Wikoff\nUp a Chimney Down\nWhat can go up a chimney down, but not down a chimney up? \n Answer: an umbrella.\nThe first joke I ever “got” was this riddle, told to me by the father of my neighbor and best friend, Karen.  I was probably five years old, and the wordplay fascinated me. \nIt still does. \nThe images in this riddle fluctuate back and forth, like that optical illusion of a chalice/vase and two silhouetted profiles facing each other, or the one of a young woman with a feathered headdress and babushka-wearing old woman with a large nose. \nFirst there are the words themselves.  “Up” and “down” are opposites.  Not only do those reverse concepts appear side by side, but they also flip their positions, so that “up down” becomes “down up.”  Then, with the introduction of the answer, the words “up” and “down” undergo yet another change, shifting meaning completely.  For an umbrella, “up” or “down” is a state of being.  An umbrella is up or down, meaning “open” or “shut.”  Yet it also can be moved up and down, as in up or down a chimney. \nAnd that’s what makes the riddle work, the surprise of this discovery and realizing with delight that the answer was there all along – like an optical illusion, hidden in plain sight, but not visible until this previously withheld information allows the mind’s eye to reshape the space between those alternating meanings to form a new image.\nThis is the way I experience the world.  Sort of a jumbled gestalt that involves noticing random things, making intuitive connections, and arriving at insights that apply obliquely to different areas of my life. \nFor better or worse, that’s the path I expect this blog will also take.\nShare this:\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nRiddle Me That Level 66: ‘What can go up a chimney down, but cannot go down a chimney up? ...

Get Out Of My Life Woman: Grasella Oliphant : A Way with Words | Down A Chimney Up Down A Chimney Up\nDown A Chimney Up\nPosted by Grant Barrett on\nJanuary 10, 2011\n· 28 Comments\nGood poetry is even better when you read it aloud. For his anthology, Essential Pleasures: A New Anthology of Poems to Read Aloud former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky selected works with just that in mind. Martha and Grant discuss a poem from the book with lines that are more delicious when spoken. Also this week: If a woman decides to keep her own name after getting married, should she be addressed as Ms. or Mrs.? When you were young, what did you call your favorite blanket? When do you redd up the table, and what does it mean to be out like Lottie’s eye?\nThis episode first aired January 23, 2010.\n  U-Turn in Other Languages\nIf you’re driving and need to turn 180 degrees, you make a U-turn. But what do you make if you speak a language that doesn’t include the letter “U”? If you’re a Hindi speaker, what do you call wearing a V-neck sweater in an A-frame house?\n  When Kids Start Speaking Late\nSome children don’t talk until they’re age three or older, then go on to do just fine. Why do some kids start speaking relatively late in life? The hosts talk about a recent Ask MetaFilter thread on that topic.\n  Good with Packing\nIs there a word that describes someone who’s good at visualizing how best to pack a suitcase or car? A Michigan woman is sure she heard such a term for someone who can visualize 3-D arrangements in advance, but darned if she can recall what it is. Can the hosts help?\n  Mexican-American Proverbs\nThe Spanish phrase “Donde lloran, esta el muerto” literally translates as “Where there’s crying, there’s a dead person.” In everyday use, however, the meaning is somewhat different. You might use it, for example, to describe someone who claims not to have money when in fact he does. A bilingual caller wonders if there’s an analogous expression that refers to someone who’s miserly despite being wealthy. Grant recommends he check out A Dictionary of Mexican-American Proverbs by Mark Glazer.\nPhoto by Dave Smith .

You astonish me! “When you’re lying awake with a dismal headache” (the show-stopper from the operetta IOLANTHE) describes, not a headache, but a sleepless night brought on by “love, unrequited.”\nOn the other hand, why am I astonished?  I guess it isn’t realistic to expect you to know everything.  It should be sufficient for me that you know nearly everything.\nAndrewH\nJanuary 25, 2010 at 2:40 pm\nI found the discussions about Ms. and Mrs. incredibly dull, and quite pointless.  I was also surprised when I first learned women taking husband’s last names could be a point of contention.  The matters were very clear to me when I was growing up in Taiwan.  When referring to a couple, it’s simply calling them by one last name as in Mr. & Mrs. Smith, so one would know Mrs. Smith, the lady, is married to Mr. Smith, the man.  When Mrs. Smith is referred to as an individual at work or otherwise, she would be called Ms. Crumpacker to show respect.  Also, women would also refer to one another as Mrs., but that doesn’t mean those women have taken the troubles to get their names changed (as a matter of fact, most don’t at my mother’s generation).  When I was young, I would call my friend’s mom something like Mother Smith, because I only knew my friend’s last name, and the lady was my friend’s mom.  I was not about to ask a bunch questions regarding her last name before saying ‘Hi’ to her for the first time!!  What is the big problem of having a practical custom for calling each other without causing a big ruckus?!\npoohbear72579\nJanuary 26, 2010 at 12:15 pm\nGreat episode, guys… and with a surprising number of cliff-hangers.  I think it’s the first episode I’ve heard in a long time where there were so many puzzling and unanswerable questions!  Still, very interesting stuff.\nThe fellow who called in to ask about the Spanish expression made me recall an old term that my family used to describe the same sort of individual referred to in the expression.  Such a person was said to be “poor-mouthing”.  In essence, this was a person who constantly complained about money but clearly had no lack of financial means.  I’ve also heard it used to describe someone who complains a lot, in general, aside from financial matters.  I think it’s a good term, too, because it’s so descriptive — this person is poor only in what they’re saying (i.e. speaking poorly of themselves).\nCossette729\nJanuary 27, 2010 at 3:18 am\nWhen the caller asked about the word “ookoosh,” I initially thought she was saying “couche-couche.” While I’ve only ever heard of this word being used for a Cajun breakfast food, it would make sense as a child’s word for a blankie because of the root word coucher (to put to bed).  However, the only French “baby word” I’ve ever heard for blankie is “dodo.” Of course, that doesn’t mean the usage isn’t out there, only that I’ve never heard it.\nJazyk\nJanuary 28, 2010 at 1:38 am\nHello, I speak Czech and my wife is Czech and neither of us have never heard ookoosh. The standard Czech word for blanket is deka, from German Decke. What my wife did find on the Internet is UkuÅ¡ as a surname. I also know Polish and ookoosh doesn’t remind me of anything. I tried ukusz and ukuÅ› in this dictionary , fantastic by the way, and there were no hits.\nJazyk\nJanuary 31, 2010 at 10:56 pm\nIn response to the question about U-turns, I can tell you that in Japanese it’s called U-turn (Uã‚¿ãƒ¼ãƒ³). It’s written with the letter U and then the english ‘turn’ is written in one of the phonetic alphabets. It’s a pretty safe bet that this word comes directly from English. In Japan they use the roman alphabet for a lot of things.  It’s used right alongside the 2 alphabets and the Chinese characters.\nRandy\nFebruary 2, 2010 at 10:56 pm\nMy parents were born and raised in the Netherlands. Growing up our family had a few choice Dutch words that were substituted in for everyday objects. One was what I always heard as “kousey” for my silk trimmed blanket. When I grew up I learned that it was actually “kusje” or little kisses. I think, perhaps, it was because I was always sucking my thumb while holding my “kousey” to my cheek. I wonder if “ookoosh” may have a similar meaning in Czech. Perhaps the word was anglicized and it is not really “ookoosh”.\nFebruary 5, 2010 at 7:18 am\nIs is possible that the word Camille was trying to remember was simply “stevedore”?  She was trying to recall the word for a person who is very good at packing and she said the letter “v” was prominent in the word.\njonathan\nFebruary 6, 2010 at 3:09 am\nGrant Barrett said:\nWhen you were small, did you have a favorite blanket? If so, what’d you call it? A woobie? A blankie? A listener says her grandmother called hers an ookoosh, and wonders if the word reflects grandma’s Czech roots.\nI am french canadian from Quebec City and I think I have the answer about that “ookoosh”\nOokoosh may come from the french words houx (holly) and couches (baby crib bedding).\nLong time ago, people of Europe thought that holly had the power to keep bad things away, like thunder and demons. Unmarried women were strongly advised to hang a branch of holly on their bed so they wouldn’t be transformed into witches!\nNowadays in French Canadian, we call it a doudou [doo-doo]. It refers to the soft texture of the blanket. Soft that we translate to doux in french. Looks pretty much like houx to me, doesn’t it?\nHalszka\nFebruary 8, 2010 at 8:07 am\nPolish linguist speaking ;P\nookoosh is definitely nothing from Polish, as has been stated above “koc” is what we use to refer to a blanket,\nthe word Martha called “szmata” (pronunced shma-tah) actually means “a piece of cloth used for cleaning”, and it has rather negative connotations. “Szmata” is something filthy, tattered, torn. It is most widely used as a vulgar term for a woman of “ill repute” or one particularly morally indecent woman. It can also be used to refer to a way of scoring a goal in soccer, whereby the player scoring kicks the ball in an exceptionally lousy manner (I’m talking like … a 10-year old with no training would normally catch it), but scores none the less, because the goal keeper’s performance is lousier still 🙂\nHalszka\nFebruary 8, 2010 at 8:27 am\noh, and about talking late in life, I know there is a story in Japanese mythology about the son of one of the mythical emporors (Jibu I think was the name) who did not speak a word until he wasten, which aggravated the court greatly. Then, when he was ten he witnessed a flock of snow-white birds flying over the royal palace and spoke for the first time in his life, asking enthusiastically for the name of the creatures. Since then he started speaking again, and there was a temple built in honor of the miracle, where birds of white plumage would be sacrificed to the gods. That’s all I can remember, but I’m sure there was quite a bit more to it than that, maybe somebody can add some details 🙂\nFebruary 10, 2010 at 11:49 am\nMy sister called her blanket her “feel-feel.” (presumably for the silk she would rub with her fingers.\nAs for Camille’s uncanny ability to visualize how the suitcases would fit in the car, I don’t know the word that starts with “V”, but how about “verisibagitude?”\ngacdg\nFebruary 14, 2010 at 9:11 pm\nI know in German there is a word “Kuscheln”, which carries the idea of cuddling. For example, a teddy bear or other similar animal figure that a child would cuddle is called “Kuscheltier”. I don’t know if that could possibly be the root of Ookoosh (or Ukusch). I haven’t heard the word “Ukusch” used in German, but I suppose it could be dialect word, or a family word derived from the concept of Kuscheln, or cuddling. I would not be surprised if German words would get in to the vocabulary of someone of Czech and Polish descent, since much of what is now the Czech republic was part of the Austrian Empire (it was then known as Bohemia), and parts of what is now Poland used to be in Prussia. Grant, with your etimology skills, and access to reference works, maybe you could try tracing this lead and see if it takes you anywhere.\nKen Mohnkern\nFebruary 15, 2010 at 11:44 am\n(I know how our hosts feel about Wikipedia, but…)\nThe Wikipedia article on Pittsburghese needs a little help.

I knew the answer was an umbrella, but I never quite got why until I actually stopped and thought about it. See, I refer to the two major states of the umbrella as “open” and “closed” not “up” and “down.” So it always kind of puzzled me, like “are they standing in a huge fireplace throwing the umbrella upwards? But then what does down mean?” So, yeah. Three cheers for stopping and thinking!

I know the possibility that this is somehow related to the issues, but I thought I”d mention it. Might be a wild goose chase and a mere coincidence, but I can”t help the image of a little kid who becomes “nakhush” and is soothed by a lullaby and a warm blanket, and becomes in turn “khush” ^_^.\nI”m a dork and I”m lovin” it!\nJackie\nKen Mohnkern said:\n(I know how our hosts feel about Wikipedia, but…)\nThe Wikipedia article on Pittsburghese needs a little help.
