The studio folded in 1972, and the building was later torn down.\nMEMPHIS (AP)  Elvis Presley fans flocking to Memphis this weekend to remember the day he died are being encouraged to also celebrate the 40th anniversary of his final No. 1 hit single, \" Suspicious Minds .\"\nWhile they can tour Graceland , the estate where he died 32 years ago, or Sun Studio , which helped make him the King of Rock 'n' Roll, the Elvis faithful can't see the place where that hit record was made. There's nothing left, not even a historical marker, to remind people of the sessions that produced the \"From Elvis in Memphis\" album.\nMOVIE MARATHON: TCM honors Elvis\nAmerican Sound Studio folded in 1972 and the building was later torn down. In its place is a beauty shop and a crumbling parking lot.\n\"I haven't been back there to see,\" said Chips Moman, who ran the studio and produced the 1969 Elvis sessions. \"I put it out of my mind.\"\nBut in 1969, American Sound Studio was at the top of its game, in the middle of a three-year span that would yield more than 100 hit records for artists that included B.J. Thomas, Neil Diamond and Dusty Springfield .\nPresley, meanwhile, had spent much of the previous years filming and recording soundtracks to his largely forgettable movies. He hadn't recorded in Memphis since leaving the Sun label in 1955.\nBut he was also coming off the roaring success of his televised comeback special in December 1968 and proved willing to take some risks in hopes of charting his first No. 1 hit in six years.\n\"All of us had always liked Elvis, his early stuff,\" Moman, 72, said in a telephone interview from his home in LaGrange, Ga. \"We didn't like all that movie stuff, so when we got our chance we wanted to cut some stuff that we liked.\"\nInitially, it didn't appear Presley was going to want to move in a different direction. He arrived at the studio in January 1969 with his sizable entourage of friends and handlers, and some potential songs were presented to Moman and the band.\n\"And of course all those guys were boogalooing to all those terrible songs,\" recalled Bobby Wood, 68, piano player for the 827 Thomas Street Band. \"And we were just standing around wondering, 'What in the world is going on here?\"'\nWood said he was approached by Elvis confidant George Klein and asked what he thought about the songs. He answered frankly that he thought \"they were a bunch of crap\" and was shocked when Klein carried that message back to Presley.\n\"I didn't know whether Elvis was going to say 'Get out of here,' or what,\" Wood said. \"But he just started laughing, and he was laughing to the top of his voice. So I knew he was all right after that.\"\nThe entourage began melting away as Presley began to gel with Moman and the house band in overnight recording sessions. He agreed to record \"In the Ghetto,\" unusual in Elvis' repertoire for its social commentary on the cycle of crime and poverty, and \"Suspicious Minds,\" which became a centerpiece of his live Las Vegas performances that would begin that year.\n\"I knew that he was only a good song away from being as big as he ever was,\" Moman said. \"I knew Elvis had what it takes.\n\"We just gave him something new, and a new kind of groove.\"\nFour years later and well into his jumpsuit-and-cape era, Elvis returned to Memphis to record at Stax Records in an effort to recapture the feel from the American sessions. Wood and several other members of the band — now known as the Memphis Boys since moving to Nashville — were brought in to back him up.\n\"The whole scenario had changed, and even Elvis didn't seem like he was that interested anymore,\" Wood said.\nThe studio was teeming with people and there were too many distractions to record quality music, he said.\n\"If you're not in control of the recording and getting it done with a small group of people, it's just not the same,\" Wood said.\nPresley never lived to see another No. 1 single. He died Aug. 16, 1977, of heart disease worsened by years of prescription drug abuse.\nCopyright 2009 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Elvis Presley's Billboard Chart Records | Billboard Elvis Presley's Billboard Chart Records | Billboard\nElvis Presley's Billboard Chart Records\nCOMMENTS\nElvis Presley\nOn what would've been the King of Rock & Roll's 78th birthday, a look back at some of his most impressive chart achievements.\nElvis Presley wasn't     just the King of Rock & Roll. He remains Billboard chart     royalty. On the anniversary of the birthday on Jan. 8, 1935, of     the late icon (who passed away on Aug. 16, 1977), here's a look     back at five of his most impressive chart records.\n- 108 Hot 100 hits, the most among rock     artists in the chart's history. Among all acts, only the \"Glee\" cast (205) and Lil Wayne (110) have     inked more charted hits. Presley's career, however, predates     the Hot 100's 1958 inception; he charted more than 30 song     entries on surveys that chronicled popular music beginning in     1956. The King's 104th Hot 100 hit, \"Way Down,\" originally     peaked at No. 31 the weeks of Aug. 6 and 13, 1977. After     dipping to No. 53, following Presley's death, the song roared     35-24-21-18, marking his last top 20 track.\n- 80 top 40 Hot 100 hits, the most such     showings in the tally's archives. Elton John ranks second     with 57. On the first Hot 100, dated Aug. 4, 1958, Presley     ranked at No. 4 with \"Hard Headed Woman\" and at No. 34 with     \"Don't Ask Me Why,\" each featuring his longtime gospel backing     band, the Jordanaires.\n- 126 Billboard 200 charted albums, the     highest total in the chart's 56-year history. Ten of those sets     reached No. 1, beginning with \"Elvis Presley,\" which ruled for     10 weeks in 1956. His most recent reign came courtesy of     \"Elv1s: 30 #1 Hits\" in 2002.\n- 67 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the     most time spent at the top for a solo act. Garth Brooks and Michael Jackson follow, each with 51 frames in charge. Presley's longest reign?     The \"Blue Hawaii\" soundtrack totaled 20 weeks at No. 1,     beginning in December 1961.\n- Presley became the first rock artist to make two trips to the Hot 100     summit, as \"Stuck on You\" began a four-week command     April 30, 1960. That song, recorded shortly after Presley's     discharge from the Army, followed \"A Big Hunk O' Love,\" which     led the Aug. 15, 1959, chart. Presley last perched atop the Hot     100 No. 1 with \"Suspicious Minds\" the week of Nov. 1, 1969. (In     another sign of how much Presley and Billboard charts have been     linked, that date doubles as Billboard's birthday; the magazine     first published the week of Nov. 1, 1894).\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\n...

A year earlier, singer Mark James had written and recorded the original for Scepter Records. Below, Mark James and producer Chips Moman, talk about the song's inspiration and how an argument over rights nearly cost the King his hit.\nMark James: In early 1968, Chips Moman asked me to come to Memphis to write songs for his music publishing company. I was living in Houston at the time and had written three hits that reached No. 1 in the South. Chips's American Sound Studio was just starting to get hot. So I relocated.\nLate one night, fooling around on my Fender guitar and using my Hammond organ pedals for a bass line, I came up with a catchy melody. I was married to my first wife then but still had feelings for my childhood sweetheart, who was married back in Houston. My wife suspected I had those feelings, so it was a confusing time for me. I felt as though all three of us were all caught in this trap that we couldn't walk out of.\nAt my recording session, Chips produced, I sang the lead vocal and the studio band backed me. The strings, horns and Holladay Sisters were overdubbed later. After the tape was mixed, Chips and I flew to Scepter in New York, where my manager had contacts. They loved the song and put it out, but the label didn't have the dollars to promote new talent, so the song didn't chart.\nLater that year, Don Cruise, Chips's partner, told me Elvis had booked American Sound to record what would become his 'From Elvis in Memphis' album. Don kept asking if I had any songs that would be a good fit. Tom Jones was hot at the time, and I knew Elvis needed a mature rock 'n' roll song to bring him back. Don and I thought of 'Suspicious Minds' and I began urging everyone to get Elvis to hear it.\nChips Moman: When Elvis arrived at my studio in January 1969, he was looking for new material.\nI played him Mark's Scepter record, and he was crazy about it. He wanted to hear the song over and over again, and learned it on the spot.\nElvis Presley at American Studios 1969.\nMark James: I wasn't at Elvis' recording.\nDays earlier I had walked into the control room and sensed he was uncomfortable. He was like, 'Who is this guy? I met him twice, why is he here?' I didn't want to jinx the song, so I stayed away.\nChips Moman: We finally got around to recording 'Suspicious Minds' after midnight [early on Jan. 23]. I had a ping-pong table, and Elvis was pretty good at it [laughing]. He used the same arrangement on Mark's single and most of the same American Sound studio musicians. When we finished, Elvis' crowd of business people standing around said they wanted half my publishing rights. I told them they were barking up the wrong tree. I accused them of stealing, they got angry, and I threatened to halt the entire session. Fortunately, RCA's Harry Jenkins said, 'This boy is right and we're going to finish the session just the way he wants to'. Jenkins sensed 'Suspicious Minds' was going to be big and he knew there would be plenty to go around.\nWhen I heard how it was embellished later, I was blown away\nMark James: The next day I heard the track at the studio. At first I thought it sounded too slow. But when I heard how it was embellished later, I was blown away. [This is important to note as Chips has always stated he was disgusted (As you will read in the next paragraph) with what Felton Jarvis did, and we are referring to the fade out and back in at the end of the song, yet here is the songwriter giving his overwhelming blessing to the extra production. Elvis fans also approve it should be noted, when in 1987 RCA removed the ending for the release, ' The Memphis Record ', fans cried out demanding it be restored.]\n[A] crazy 15-second fade toward the end\nChips Moman: Felton Jarvis [Elvis' longtime producer] was never happy that Elvis recorded at American. It was a control thing. So when Jarvis took the tape of 'Suspicious Minds', he added this crazy 15-second fade toward the end, like the song was ending, and brought it back by overdubbing to extend it.\nI have no idea why he did that, but he messed it up. It was like a scar. None of which mattered. Soon after the song was released, Elvis was back on top of the charts.\nMark James: In the years that followed, whenever I saw Elvis, he'd cross the room just to say hello to me - no matter who was with him. After he died, I heard he'd always asked the guys in the studio, 'Did Mark send me any more songs?' Golly, I wish I had known that.\nAbout Mark James\nMark James is a songwriter, famous for writing hits for singers Elvis Presley , BJ Thomas and others. Mark James, whose real name is Francis Zambon, was born in 1940 and grew up in Houston, Texas.\nBy the late 1960s, James was signed as a staff songwriter to Memphis producer Chips Moman's publishing company , Moman produced Thomas's versions of The Eyes Of A New York Woman, Hooked On A Feeling and It's Only Love in 1968-69, and all achieved success. The songwriter wrote, sang and issued his own version of Suspicious Minds, also produced by Chips Moman , on Scepter Records in 1968 but without success and in the same arrangement the song became a worldwide smash hit for Elvis Presley in 1969.\nBrenda Lee had a hit with Sunday Sunrise. Elvis recorded other songs written by Mark James namely:- Its Only Love, Raised On Rock and Moody Blue.\nIncredibly James' greatest personal success came with Always on My Mind , a writing collaboration with Johnny Christopher and Wayne Carson Thompson and issued as a b-side to Separate Ways by Elvis Presley in 1972 in the USA. It was a hit for Elvis but it was a huge hit for Willie Nelson in 1982. Mark\nJames won a Grammy Award for Song of the Year for Willie Nelson's version. UK duo The Pet Shop Boys had a UK #1 and US #4 with their 1987 revival of the song.\nElvis Presley, Willie Nelson and Brenda Lee.\nJames also wrote the song Moody Blue, which is also the name of Elvis' last album. In 1979 Mark James wrote a beautiful song about Elvis called Blue Suede Heaven It was featured in the documentary 'The Echo Will Never Die' with Kasey Casem'\nAll the songs Elvis recorded of Mark James were hit singles peaking at:\n'Suspicious Minds' # 2 [1969]\n'Always on my mind' # 9 [1972]\n'Raised on Rock' # 36 [1973]\n'Moody Blue' # 6. [1977]\n'Its Only Love' # 3 [1980]\n'The Elvis Medley', containing 'Suspicious Minds', #51.\n'Always on my mind' reissues #59 [1985] and #13 [1997].\n'Suspicious minds' 'live' #15 [2001].\n'Suspicious Minds' #11 [2007] whilst on the same run\n'Always on my mind' #17 [2007].\n' Raised on Rock ' and ' Moody Blue ' were chosen as the titles of the albums on which they first appeared. In the states 'Suspicious Minds' and 'Moody Blue' were numbers one's. 'Its only love' was lifted from the Elvis Aron Presley box set in 1980.\nMore Interviews\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nUnfortunately, this joyous time would not last. ... 4:14) A short biography of Elvis Presley ...

By the mid-1950s, he appeared on the radio, television and the silver screen. On August 16, 1977, at age 42, he died of heart failure, which was related to his drug addiction. Since his death, Presley has remained one of the world's most popular music icons.\nEarly Interest in Music\nMusician and actor Elvis Aron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi. (He later changed the spelling of his middle  name to the biblical form of Aaron.) Presley was supposed to be a twin, but his brother, Jesse Garon  (sometimes spelled Jessie) was stillborn. From very humble beginnings, Elvis Presley grew up to become one of the biggest names in rock 'n' roll.\nRaised by loving,  working-class parents, Presley's family had little money, and they moved from place to place frequently. He was deeply devoted to his parents, especially his  mother, Gladys, and was raised to have a strong faith in God. Presley  attended the Assembly of God Church with his parents, where gospel  music became an important influence for him.\nPresley received his first  guitar as a gift from his mother on his 11th birthday in 1946 and had his first taste of musical success a few years later when he won a talent show at Humes High School in Memphis. After graduating  in 1953, he worked a number of jobs while pursuing his musical dream. He  cut his first demo record at what later became known as Sun Studio that  year, and before long, Sam Phillips, the record label owner, decided to  take the young performer under his wing. Presley soon began touring and recording, trying to catch his first big break. \"That's All Right\" was  Presley's first single in 1954.\nFirst No. 1 Hit\nIn 1955, Presley began to  develop a following with fans being drawn to his unusual musical style,  provocative gyrating hips and good looks. That same year, he signed  with RCA Records, a deal worked out by his manager, Colonel Tom Parker.  Presley was on a roll, scoring his first No. 1 single with  \"Heartbreak Hotel,\" as well as his first No. 1 album, Elvis Presley, and  signing a movie contract with Paramount Pictures—all in 1956. Despite  the uproar that his sexy dance moves caused, he also became a popular guest  on a number of television variety shows.\nSoon, Presley was everywhere—on the radio, television and the silver screen—working as a musician and actor. His first film, Love Me Tender (1956), was a box office hit. Even a stint in the U.S. military  couldn't put a damper on Presley's thriving career. He received his  draft notice in 1957, and was inducted into the Army the following March.  He eventually served in Germany for about a year and a half. Shortly before  Presley left for Europe, his beloved mother, Gladys, died. He was granted a  leave and returned to Memphis for the funeral. Deeply saddened by her  death, Presley returned to duty. While in Germany, his spirits were lifted slightly when he met a young teenager named Priscilla Beaulieu.\nAfter  leaving the Army in 1960, Presley resumed his career and was soon back at the top of the charts with the soundtrack for his film GI Blues. He continued recording music and acting in such films as Blue Hawaii (1961), Girls! Girls! Girls! (1962) and Viva Las Vegas (1964). Though his films were often hit or miss with both critics and audiences, they brought in a profit and the soundtracks usually sold well. By  the late 1960s, however, the enigmatic performer appeared to be losing his box office  appeal. Proving he was still the \"King of Rock 'n' Roll,\" he recorded his first TV special in 1968, often referred to as the \"'68  Comeback.\" He wowed audiences with his performance, which showcased his  talents as a singer and a guitarist.\nPersonal Obstacles\nAround this time, Presley's personal life also seemed to be on  an upswing. He and Priscilla wed in 1967 and had a daughter, Lisa Marie, the following year. Unfortunately, this joyous time would not last.  By the early 1970s, Presley's marriage was falling apart. The couple  divorced in 1973, and Priscilla received custody of Lisa Marie. Presley was  also wrestling with other personal problems, including a growing  addiction to prescription drugs; the once-thin rock star was battling a  weight problem, and his destructive lifestyle caught up with him that  fall, when he was hospitalized for drug-related health problems.\nDespite his  personal obstacles, Presley remained a popular draw in Las Vegas and on  tour. He performed at his last concert in June 1977, in Indianapolis, Indiana.  After the concert, he returned home to his Memphis mansion,  Graceland, to prepare for another tour.\nDeath and Legacy\nSometime in the morning of  August 16, 1977, Presley died of heart failure, at the age of 42. It was later ruled that his death was related to his prescription drug use. Presley was buried on the Graceland property, near the gravesites of his mother, Gladys,  father Vernon and grandmother Minnie Mae Hood Presley.\nThroughout his amazing career, Presley helped popularize rock 'n'  roll  music in America. He also won three Grammy Awards for his gospel   recordings. A major musical force, Presley had 18 No. 1 singles,   including \"Don't Be Cruel,\" \"Good Luck Charm\" and \"Suspicious Minds,\" as   well as countless gold and platinum albums. He was one of the first   performers inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1986). But Elvis has been recognized for his contributions several musical genres, most notably rock, country and gospel. In 1998, Presley was posthumously inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame; three years later, he was posthumously inducted into the Gospel Music Association's Gospel Music Hall of Fame.\nSince his death, Presley has remained one of the world's most popular music icons.  Over the  years, several documentaries and films have explored the  enigmatic performer, including a 2005 television miniseries  starring  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Elvis. Presley's Memphis home, Graceland, is  open to  the public, and numerous fans from around the world visit the  legendary  residence annually, especially around Presley's birthday and the  anniversary of his death.\nThousands of fans traveled to Graceland  on August 16, 2012—the 35th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death—for a special vigil in honor of the King of Rock 'n' Roll. During the gathering, fans held lit candles and stood outside of Presley's home. Though the Presley family holds a tribute event each year to mark  the anniversary of Presley's death, the 2012 gathering was unique: Presley's estranged wife, Priscilla, and daughter Lisa Marie Presley appeared together for the first time at the annual event.\n\"You should see this from our point-of-view. It's amazing,\" Priscilla  Presley said during the event, according to the Washington Post. \"The candles are lit. It's  truly a sight to behold ... This is something that Elvis would never, ever have believed could have taken place here.\"\nVideos\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nIt had been three years since Elvis Presley had enjoyed a top 10 album and seven years since his last no.1 but ...

Elvis looked the part as well and Bill Haley was already in his 30s and never had the sexual attraction of his younger rival. Elvis Presley's first chart album, Rock n Roll also spent just one week at the top in 1956. The first RCA single Heartbreak Hotel established Elvis as an international superstar and by the time he had also had hit singles with Blue Suede Shoes, I Want You I Need You I Love You and the double sided Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel, the first LP was eagerly awaited. When Rock n Roll was finally released it was a compilation of four of the Sun label tracks recorded in 1954/5 but also included a cover of Little Richard's Tutti Fruitti and Carl Perkins Blue Suede Shoes. Despite the LPs impact, entering at no.3 at the beginning of November and one week later, hitting no.1, it only spent a total of seven weeks on the listings and by mid December, it had departed.\nTop albums of 1956\n2 Soundtrack - King And I\n3 Soundtrack - Oklahoma\n4 Bill Haley & Comets - Rock Around The Clock\n5 Frank Sinatra - Songs For Swingin' Lovers\n6 Bill Haley & Comets - Rock n Roll Stage Shows\n7 Lonnie Donegan - Showcase\n8 Elvis Presley - Rock n Roll\n9 Mel Torme - At The Crescendo\n10 Soundtrack - Eddy Duchin Story\n1957\nAfter one week at no.1 with Rock n Roll the previous year, he reached no.3 with its follow up Rock n Roll no.2 featuring both the rockin side of Elvis Rip It Up, Long Tall Sally and Paralysed and his ballads Love me and Old Shep. There was also a compilation LP The Best Of Elvis. He went one place better to end the year at no.2 with Elvis Christmas Album which combined the four tracks from the 'Peace In The Valley' EP, religious gospel collection including the title track, Take My Hand and I Believe, along with recordings of seasonal standards and popular Christmas classics White Christmas, Silent Night, Santa Claus Is Back In Town, Blue Christmas and O Little Town Of Bethlehem. He also achieved his second no.1 LP with the soundtrack to Loving You which spent 3 weeks at no.1 and 10 weeks at no.2, using songs featured in Elvis' second film on one side with new tracks on the other and included the hits (Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear, Party, Got A Lot Of Livin To Do and the title track.\n1958\nIn September, Elvis Presley returned to the top with the soundtrack to his film King Creole. One place lower at no.2 was last year's soundtrack Loving You and a new compilation Elvis Golden Records. King Creole was the last film made by Elvis before entering the US army and also the last in black and white. The songs in the film included the hit singles Hard Headed Woman and the title track and features the Jordanaires on backing vocals, particularly on all the ballads. Elvis Golden Records was one of Rock n Roll's first unashamed greatest hits collection, 14 tracks, 10 of which were US number one singles between 1956 to date.\n1959\nWith Elvis Presley away on military service in the US army, his two 1959 albums both peaked at no.4, A Date With Elvis and Elvis, a reissue of the Rock n Roll LP with 4 extra tracks. A Date With Elvis could also be described as a re-issue of sorts as five of the tracks were from the Sun records era of 1954-1955 including Milkcow Blues Boogie, Good Rockin Tonight, Baby Let's Play House and Blue Moon Of Kentucky, the packaging was a deluxe gatefold sleeve, innovative at the time with photos of Elvis in uniform.\n1960\nWith Elvis' return from the US army with new material, Elvis Is Back not surprisingly, produced another no.1. Elvis had matured whilst away and released an album with a mixture of blues, It Feels So Right and Like A Baby, ballads The Thrill Of Your Love, Soldier Boy and Peggy Lee's Fever, Rock n Roll Dirty Dirty Feeling, a Gospel track I Will Be Home Again along with Such A Night and The Girl Of My Best Friend.\nTop albums of 1960\n2 Elvis Presley - Elvis Is Back\n3 One Hundred & One Strings - Down Drury Lane To Memory Lane\n4 Buddy Holly - Buddy Holly Story\n5 Soundtrack - Can Can\n6 Duane Eddy - The Twangs The Thang\n7 Cliff Richard - Cliff Sings\n8 Original London Cast - Oliver\n9 Everly Brothers - It's Everly Time\n10 Cliff Richard - Me And My Shadows\n1961\nThe best selling LP of 1961 was Elvis Presley's GI Blues which had entered the chart in the final weeks of 1960. GI Blues moved up to no.1 in the second week of 1961 to become Elvis' 5th no.1 LP, remained at the top throughout January and February, had another three weeks at no.1 in March and a further twelve weeks between April and June, spending a total of 22 weeks at no.1. With four no.1 singles during the year, Elvis Presley was, by quite a distance, the best selling artist of 1961 and this year, he also enjoyed a no.2 LP with Something For Everybody, a no.3 with the Gospel LP His Hand In Mine and right at the end of the year, released the LP that would go on to dominate the first half of 1962, Blue Hawaii.\nSomething for Everybody included the rockers I'm Coming Home, Judy, I Slipped I Stumbled I Fell and Put The Blame On Me as well as the ballads There's Always Me, It's A Sin and In Your Arms. His Hand In Mine is Elvis' first full length Gospel LP following his 'Peace In The Valley' EP, four years ago. His backing singers on this LP included the Swan Silvertones and The Golden Gate Quartet and they greatly influence Elvis' lead singing. This was Elvis back to his original musical roots where he had heard Gospel music in black churches in the 1940s. Joshua Fit The Battle and Swing Down Sweet Chariot sound as if they could have been performed in a church and the LP ranged between the quartet ballad songs, His Hand In Mine, In My Fathers House, Known Only To Him and He Knows Just What I Need, to Rock n Roll, Milky White Way, and Working On The Building.\nTop albums of 1961\n1 Elvis Presley - G.I.

The year began with Elvis' Blue Hawaii at the top, his 6th no.1 LP and the second best seller of the year. Blue Hawaii spent 18 weeks at no.1 and 10 weeks at no.2, a total that could not be bettered this year. The film soundtrack produced memorable hits such as Can't Help Falling In Love and Rock A Hula Baby. Elvis plays Chad Gates, an ex GI from Hawaii and wants nothing more than to hang out with his friends and girlfriend on the beaches even though his father wants him to begin work at The Great Southern Hawaiian Fruit Company.\nBy the end of June, he had his 7th no.1 LP, Pot Luck which with 6 weeks at the top, became the 4th best seller of 1962. The number one single She's Not You was not included. Suspicion, a track that would have to wait a further 14 years to receive a release on single was a highlight. Also on 'Pot Luck' was the usual mixture of ballads That's Someone You Never Forget and Fountain Of Love. Elvis' second HMV LP Rock n Roll No.2 was re issued on his current label RCA, reaching no.3 as it had done first time around in 1957.\nTop albums of 1962\n1 Soundtrack - West Side Story\n2 Elvis Presley - Blue Hawaii\n3 Cliff Richard & Shadows - Young Ones (Soundtrack)\n4 Elvis Presley - Pot Luck\n5 Soundtrack - South Pacific\n6 Kenny Ball-Chris Barber-Acker Bilk - Best Of Ball Barber & Bilk\n7 Shadows - Out Of The Shadows\n8 George Mitchell Minstrels - Black And White Minstrel Show\n9 Lonnie Donegan - Golden Age Of Lonnie Donegan\n10 Shadows - Shadows\n1969\nWhat a comeback.\nIt had been three years since Elvis Presley had enjoyed a top 10 album and seven years since his last no.1 but in 1969 he achieved 3 top 10 albums, 2 number twos and his 8th number one, all in the space of four months.\nIn May, Elvis The NBC TV Special spent one week as the runner LP, in July, Flaming Star was the runner up for three weeks and in August the album From Elvis In Memphis, spent one week at the top and just five short weeks in the top 10. The NBC TV Special features several medleys including one 14 minute medley with live versions of a few of his biggest early hits, Heartbreak Hotel, Hound Dog, All Shook Up and Can't Help Falling In Love, Jailhouse Rock, Don't Be Cruel, Blue Suede Shoes and Love Me Tender.\n'Flaming Star' the film dated back to 1960 but at that time, the soundtrack was not released. Now riding a new popularity, it was finally released and would have topped the charts had it not been for the budget priced Jim Reeves 'According To My Heart' album. The NBC TV Special was a great success and this prompted Elvis to return to his Memphis roots and record an album of songs that had been sitting in his repertoire without being exploited in any way, but songs that Elvis actually wanted to sing, all original recordings although Only The Strong Survive had become a hit for Jerry Butler It Keeps Right On A Hurtin' was a country hit for Johnny Tillotson and Gentle On My Mind was the song that provided Dean Martin with his comeback. The album ended with one of his biggest hits for five years, the no.2 single, In The Ghetto.\n1970\nElvis Presley: On Stage was a live album of recordings made at the International Hotel in Las Vegas in February featuring mostly cover versions of recent hits, Release Me, Sweet Caroline and Proud Mary, as well as live versions of his own hits Suspicious Minds and In The Ghetto and it did also introduce his own The Wonder Of You which as a live recording was a number one single for 6 weeks in the summer.\n1971\nElvis Presley charted three albums in 1971, Love Letters From Elvis, Elvis Country, subtitled I'm 10000 Years Old, a country album with his versions of the tracks There Goes My Everything and Make The World Go Away, but also non country tracks Whole Lotta Shakin Goin' On and Snowbird and also Cmon Everybody.\n1972\nElvis Presley had the live album Elvis At Madison Square Garden, one of several live albums by Elvis during the early 1970s and featured his recent singles Polk Salad Annie, You Don't Have To Say You Love Me and American Trilogy, and also many of his older hits Love Me, All Shook Up, Heartbreak Hotel and Hound Dog.\n1973\nElvis Presley reached no.11 with Aloha From Hawaii via Satellite from the TV show\n1974\nAn album that was promoted well was the Elvis Presley double album, 40 Greatest Hits on the Arcade label. Despite ending the year as the fourth best selling album, it did not chart at all in 1974 in the main album charts, a victim of the ban on compilations and albums advertised on TV from entering the charts. In retrospect, it appears this ban was aimed mostly at the specialist record companies, K Tel, Ronco and Arcade who compiled albums with assorted themes, mostly compilations of various artists and advertised them on TV for a short while, but also some single artists greatest hits. And here was an album by Elvis Presley, one of the world's top artists, selling well enough to be no.1 for 15 weeks on the mid price and TV advertisted albums chart, but not appearing in the main charts at all. Indeed during December when the album was at its peak, and would have been the number one album throughout the Christmas period.\nTop albums of 1974\n1 Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973\n2 Paul McCartney & Wings - Band On The Run\n3 Mike Oldfield - Tubular Bells\n4 Elvis Presley - 40 Greatest\n5 Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon\n6 David Bowie - Diamond Dogs\n7 Elton John - Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\n8 Perry Como - And I Love You So\n9 Simon & Garfunkel - Greatest Hits\n10 Elton John - Greatest Hits\n1975\nOn 5th July 1975, the price criteria for eligibility for the main albums chart was changed to include any album above £1.26. The mid price and TV advertised album chart was discontinued and the main album chart was increased to a top 60 with the previous mid price title, Elvis Presley 40 Greatest and filling the chart position, 25.

The Arcade records compilation 40 Greatest Hits had spent 15 weeks at no.1 in 1974 and 1975 in the separated mid price and TV advertised LP charts. When the rules were changed in July 1975 to allow its eligibility into the main album charts, it was well past it's peak and could only reach No.16 in January 1976.\nElvis' death at the age of 42 this year propelled the album back into the charts, finally reaching no.1 for just one week on the 10th of September. On that week, Elvis had three albums in the top 10, The Greatest Hits at no.1, Moody Blue at no.4 and Welcome To My World at no.7 and on a wave of sympathy and mourning, no fewer than 10 albums inside that weeks' top 30. Moody Blue would rise one place two weeks later. The Greatest Hits featured 18 tracks that had reached no.1, including a couple of double A sided hits, 8 that peaked at no.2 and a further 7 top 10 hits. It concentrated on his Rock n Roll 1950s singles but strangely excluded The Wonder Of You, his most recent no.1 hit although ended with There Goes My Everything and Don't Cry Daddy, two of his lesser hits from the early 1970s. Moody Blue was the last album he recorded before his death which showed Elvis at his mid 1970s unadventurous stage. It seemed as if everyone had already covered Unchained Melody which started this album which went on to his versions of If You Love Me Let Me Know, Little Darlin, He'll Have To Go and Let Me Be There. The title track was a top 10 single but a potential minor hit, Way Down, suddenly turned into a number one single as soon as RCA could get enough copies into the shops.\nWelcome To My World was put together by RCA when they needed some new material as Elvis had not had put out a hit album since the early 1970s but this was culled from his country phase and was filled with versions of classic country hits, Help Me Make It Through The Night, Release Me, For The Good Times, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry, Your Cheatin Heart and I Can't Stop Loving You. It wouldn't have got anywhere near the top 10 apart from in those weeks of early September, immediately following his death.\nAlbum\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nElvis Presley biography on ...

Elvis Presley | Rolling Stone Elvis Presley | Rolling Stone\nartists > E > Elvis Presley >                      Bio\nElvis Presley Bio\nElvis Presley was rock & roll’s first real star, not to mention one of the most important cultural forces in history, a hip-shaking symbol of liberation for the staid America of the 1950s. A white Southerner singing blues laced with country, and country laced with gospel, he brought together American music from both sides of the color line and performed it with a natural sexuality that made him a teen idol and role model for generations of cool rebels. He was repeatedly dismissed as vulgar, incompetent, and a bad influence, but the force of his music and his image was no mere merchandising feat. Presley signaled to mainstream culture that it was time to let go. Four decades after his death, Presley’s image and influence remain undiminished. While certainly other artists preceded him to the alter of rock & roll, he is indisputably The King.\nAs a recording artist, Presley’s accomplishments are unparalleled. He is believed to have sold more than one billion records worldwide, about 40 percent of those outside the U.S. Though the figures are controversial due to the methods of computation by the Recording Industry Association of America, Presley still appears to hold the largest number of gold, platinum, and multiplatinum certifications of any artist in history; as of While certainly other artists preceded him to the alter of rock & roll, he is indisputably its king.'2010, 151 different albums and singles. He remained an unmatched chart performer from the Seventies until the first decade of the 21st Century when, as the population of record buyers increased, the chart numbers of top sellers like Mariah Carey and Madonna began to challenge his. According to Billboard, Elvis had 149 charting pop singles: 114 Top 40, 40 Top Ten, and 18 Number Ones.\nBorn January 8, 1935 in East Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley was the son of Gladys and Vernon Presley, a sewing-machine operator and a truck driver. Elvis’ twin brother, Jesse Garon, was stillborn, and Elvis grew up an only child. When he was three, his father served an eight-month prison term for writing bad checks, and afterward Vernon Presley’s employment was erratic, keeping the family just above poverty level. The Presleys attended the First Assembly of God Church, and its Pentecostal services always involved singing.\nIn 1945 Presley won second prize at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Diary Show for his rendition of Red Foley’s “Old Shep.” The following January he received a guitar for his birthday. In 1948 the family moved to Memphis, and while attending L.C. Humes High School there, Presley spent much of his spare time hanging around the black section of town, especially on Beale Street, where bluesmen like Furry Lewis and B.B. King performed.\nUpon graduation in June 1953, Presley worked at the Precision Tool Company and then drove a truck for Crown Electric. He planned to become a truck driver and had begun to wear his long hair pompadoured, the current truck-driver style. That summer he recorded “My Happiness” and “That’s Where Your Heartaches Begin” at the Memphis Recording Service, a sideline Sam Phillips had established in his Sun Records studios where anyone could record a 10-inch acetate for four dollars.\nPresley was reportedly curious to know what he sounded like and gravely disappointed by what he heard. But he returned to the Recording Service again on January 4, 1954, and recorded “Casual Love Affair” and “I’ll Never Stand in Your Way.” This time he met Phillips, who called him later that spring to record a song that Phillips had received on a demo, “Without You.” Despite numerous takes, Presley failed miserably and at Phillips’ request just began singing songs in the studio. Phillips then began to believe that he had finally found what he had been looking for: “a white man with the Negro sound and the Negro feel.”\nPhillips enlisted lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, both of whom were then playing country & western music in Doug Poindexter’s Starlight Wranglers. Though some sources cite the date of their first meeting as July 4, 1954, the three had actually rehearsed for several months, and on July 5, 1954, they recorded three songs: “I Love You Because,” “Blue Moon of Kentucky,” and the A-side of Presley’s eventual debut, Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup’s “That’s All Right.”\nTwo days later Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips (no relation to Sam) played the song on his Red Hot and Blue show on radio station WHBQ. Audience response was overwhelming, and that night Presley came to the studio for his first interview. Scotty Moore became Presley’s manager, and “That’s All Right” b/w “Blue Moon of Kentucky” became his first local hit. After playing local shows, Presley made his first — and last — appearance at the Grand Ole Opry on September 25. Legend has it that after his performance he was advised by the Opry’s talent coordinator to go back to driving trucks.\nBy October Presley had debuted on The Louisiana Hayride, a popular radio program on which he appeared regularly through 1955. He made his television debut on a local television version of Hayride in March 1955. Meanwhile, “Good Rockin’ Tonight” b/w “I Don’t Care If the Sun Don’t Shine” were hits in the Memphis area.\nIn early 1955 Moore stopped managing Presley, although he would continue to play in Presley’s band for several years. Presley’s new manager was Memphis disc jockey Bob Neal. Colonel Thomas Parker first entered Presley’s career when he helped Neal make some tour arrangements. Presley, still considered a country act, continued to perform locally, and in April he traveled to New York City, where he auditioned unsuccessfully for Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts program. But on May 13 his performance in Jacksonville, Florida, started a riot, Presley’s first. “Baby, Let’s Play House” b/w “I’m Left, You’re Right, She’s Gone” was released and hit Number Ten on the national C&W chart in July.\nThat September, Presley had his first Number One country record, a version of Junior Parker’s “Mystery Train” b/w “I Forgot to Remember to Forget.” By this time Colonel Parker, despite Presley’s agreement with Neal, had become increasingly involved in his career. When RCA purchased Presley’s contract from Sun for a then unheard-of $35,000, Hill and Range, a music publisher with which Parker had some connections, purchased Sam Phillips’ Hi-Lo Music for another $15,000. In addition, Presley received a $5,000 advance, with which he bought his mother a pink Cadillac. (It remains among his possessions preserved at Graceland.)\nPresley became a national star in 1956. He and Parker traveled to Nashville, where Presley cut his first records for RCA (including “I Got a Woman,” “Heartbreak Hotel,” and “I Was the One”), and on January 28, 1956, the singer made his national television debut on the Dorsey Brothers’ Stage Show, followed by six consecutive appearances. In March, Parker signed Presley to a managerial agreement for which he would receive 25 percent of Presley’s earnings. The contract would last through Presley’s lifetime and beyond.\nPresley performed on the Milton Berle, Steve Allen, and Ed Sullivan television shows. The Colonel arranged Presley’s debut at the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas that April, but the two-week engagement was canceled after one week due to poor audience response. In August he began filming his first movie, Love Me Tender, which was released three months later and recouped its $1 million cost in three days. Elvis’ hit singles that year were all certified gold; they included “Heartbreak Hotel” (Number One), “I Was the One” (Number 19), “Blue Suede Shoes” (Number 20), “I Want You, I Need You, I Love You” (Number One), “Don’t Be Cruel” b/w “Hound Dog” (Number One), “My Baby Left Me” (Number 31), “Love Me Tender” (Number One), “Anyway You Want Me (That’s How I Will Be)” (Number 20), “Love Me” (Number Two), and “When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold” (Number 19). By early 1957 he was the idol of millions of teens and the perfect target for the wrath of critics, teachers, clergy, and even other entertainers (including many country performers), all of whom saw his style as too suggestive; he was nicknamed Elvis the Pelvis by one writer. Presley repeatedly claimed not to understand what all the criticism was about. On January 6, 1957, when Presley made the last of his three appearances on Ed Sullivan’s show, he was shown only from the waist up.\nIn March 1957 Presley purchased Graceland, a former church that had been converted into a 23-room mansion; the next month “All Shook Up” began an eight-week run at Number One. It was preceded in 1957 by “Poor Boy” (Number 24), “Too Much” (Number One), and “Playing for Keeps” (Number 21). Presley’s next single was his first gospel release, “(There’ll Be) Peace in the Valley (For Me)”; it went to Number 25.\nPresley was also the first rock star to cross over into films with consistently commercial, if not critical, success. His second film, Loving You, was released in July 1957, and “(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear” from the soundtrack hit Number One on the pop, country, and R&B charts, as did “All Shook Up,” and “Jailhouse Rock,” the title song from Presley’s next movie, which featured Lieber and Stoller songs. Other hit singles from 1957 were “Loving You” (Number 20) and “Treat Me Nice” (Number 18).\nThat December Presley received his draft notice but was granted a 60-day deferment to complete filming King Creole, a drama based on the novel A Stone for Danny Fisher, costarring Carolyn Jones and Walter Mattau. These first four feature films are considered to be his best. Early in the game, Presley truly intended to be taken seriously as an actor. Unfortunately, once he left the service, the choice of roles was left entirely up to Colonel Parker, and the results were rarely satisfactory for either the audience or Presley. However, since Presley would not tour again until the early Seventies, it was through the films that most fans saw him. Despite anything that might be said of these films, that reason alone accounts for their massive success.\nOn March 24, 1958, Presley entered the army. The preceding months brought two hits: “Don’t” (Number One, 1958) and “I Beg of You” (Number Eight, 1958). He took leave a few months later to be with his mother; Gladys Presley died the day after his arrival home in Memphis, on August 14, 1958. In later interviews Presley would call her death the great tragedy of his life. In the years since his death, much has been written about his relationship with his mother and her impact on him. She was without question the most important person in his life. At her funeral, he cried out, “You know how much I lived my whole life just for you,” words that were both true in the moment and prophetic, for the absence of Gladys, and his love for her, seemed to have never really left his mind. He was shipped to Bremerhaven, West Germany, and in January 1960 was promoted to sergeant. He was discharged that March.\nColonel Parker, meanwhile, had continued to release singles Presley had recorded before his departure, ensuring that while Elvis was gone, he would not be forgotten. He scored a number of hits in absentia, including “Wear My Ring Around Your Neck” (Number Two, 1958), “Don’tcha Think It’s Time” (Number 15, 1958), “Hard Headed Woman” (Number One, 1958), “Don’t Ask Me Why” (Number 25, 1958), “One Night” (Number Four, 1958), “I Got Stung” (Number Eight, 1958), “(Now and Then There’s) A Fool Such as I” (Number Two, 1959), “I Need Your Love Tonight” (Number Four, 1959), “A Big Hunk o’ Love” (Number One, 1959), and “My Wish Came True” (Number 12, 1959). In 1958 alone, Presley earned over $2 million. Shortly after returning to civilian life, Presley made his first stereo record, “Stuck on You” (Number One), and in late March 1960, he taped a TV program with Frank Sinatra, The Frank Sinatra-Timex Special.\nIn July, Presely’s father remarried. Vernon Presley’s second wife, Davada “Dee” Stanley, and her three sons would later write Elvis: We Love You Tender, one of dozens of insiders’ tell-all biographies that were published following his death. Also at this time, Presley gathered more closely around him the friends, employees, and hangers-on who would become known as the Memphis Mafia and would accompany him almost constantly until his death. Presley’s world became increasingly insular.\nThe films G.I. Blues and Flaming Star were released in 1960, and “It’s Now or Never” hit Number One in both the U.K. and the U.S. Presley had five Number One U.S. hits: “Stuck on You,” “It’s Now or Never,” “Are You Lonesome Tonight” (1960); “Surrender” (1961); and “Good Luck Charm” (1962). Other Top 10 singles included “I Feel So Bad” (Number Five, 1961), “Little Sister” (Number Five, 1961), “(Marie’s the Name) His Latest Flame” (Number Four, 1961), “Can’t Help Falling in Love” (Number Two, 1961), “She’s Not You” (Number Five, 1962), “Return to Sender” (Number Two, 1962), “(You’re the) Devil in Disguise” (Number Three, 1963), and “Bossa Nova Baby” (Number Eight, 1963). Meanwhile, over Christmas 1960, Priscilla Beaulieu, the teenage daughter of an army officer whom Elvis met in Germany, visited Graceland. In early 1961 she moved in to live, it was said, under the supervision of Presley’s father and stepmother. Interestingly, the press largely went along with the spin Colonel Parker put on the story, and few seemed troubled that the King of Rock & Roll shared his domain with his teenage girlfriend.\nAfter a live performance on March 25, 1961, at a benefit for the USS Arizona, Presley left the concert stage. He spent the next eight years making B movies: Wild in the Country; Blue Hawaii (1961); Follow That Dream; Kid Galahad; Girls! Girls! Girls! (1962); It Happened at the World’s Fair; Fun in Acapulco (1963); Kissin’ Cousins; Viva Las Vegas; Roustabout (1964); Girl Happy; Tickle Me; Harum Scarum (1965); Frankie and Johnny; Paradise, Hawaiian Style; Spinout (1966); Easy Come, Easy Go; Double Trouble; Clambake (1967); Stay Away Joe; Speedway; Live a Little, Love a Little (1968); Charro!; The Trouble with Girls (and How to Get Into It); Change of Habit (1969). With a few exceptions, the soundtrack music was generally poor. But by the mid-Sixties Presley was earning $1 million per movie plus a large percentage of the gross. Most of the movies had a concurrently released soundtrack LP. Four of them hit Number One (Loving You, G.I. Blues, Blue Hawaii, Roustabout), and an additional seven were Top 10. Presley often made his displeasure with these films known to friends and associates, but Colonel Parker would not relent in his insistence that his sole client stick with a winning formula. Years later, in 1974, Parker’s shortsightedness as a manager resulted in his refusing Barbra Streisand’s offer to have Presley costar with her in what became a hit remake of A Star Is Born. Parker felt Streisand didn’t deserve equal billing with Presley.\nMeanwhile, the younger rock audience heard Presley disciples like the Beatles more often than they heard Presley himself. But Presley did not disappear and he was not, like most American rockers, swept away by the British Invasion, though the Top 10 became increasingly beyond his reach, with only “Crying in the Chapel” (which he recorded in 1960) at Number Three (1965) making the cut. Presley turned increasingly inward, focusing on his family. On May 1, 1967, Elvis and Priscilla were wed in Las Vegas; on February 1, 1968, their only child, Lisa Marie, was born. Fearing he had been forgotten, Presley made a last-gasp bid to regain his footing. He defied Colonel Parker and followed the advice of director Steve Binder for his “comeback” television special. (Parker had wanted it to be a Christmas show.) Over the summer Presley taped the surprisingly raw, powerful Elvis television special that was broadcast on December 3 to high ratings. Its soundtrack reached Number Eight. It included his first performance before an audience in over seven years (though many portions were taped without an audience). It also spun off his first Top 15 single since 1965, the socially conscious “If I Can Dream” (Number 12, 1968). The importance of this moment in Presley’s life cannot be overestimated. Years later, the ’68 comeback special still stands as one of the most powerful performances in rock history.\nWith that success behind him, Presley turned to performing in Las Vegas. His monthlong debut at the International Hotel in Las Vegas began on July 26, 1969, and set the course for all of Presley’s future performances. His fee for the four weeks was over $1 million. Riding the crest of his comeback, Presley released a series of top singles, including “In the Ghetto” (Number Three, 1969), “Suspicious Minds” (Number One, 1969 — his first chart-topper in over seven years), “Don’t Cry Daddy” (Number Six, 1969), and “The Wonder of You” (Number Nine, 1970). He toured the country annually, selling out showrooms, auditoriums, and arenas, frequently breaking box-office records. Until his death, he performed a total of nearly 1,100 concerts. There were two on-tour documentaries released, Elvis: That’s the Way It Is (1970) and Elvis on Tour (1972), the latter of which won the Golden Globe Award for Best Doucmentary.\nPresley was honored with countless Elvis Presley Days in cities across the country, and the U.S. Jaycees named him one of the 10 most outstanding young men in America in 1970. His birthplace in Tupelo was opened to the public, and on January 18, 1972, the portion of Highway 51 South that runs in front of Graceland was renamed Elvis Presley Boulevard. That October, Presley had his last Top 10 hit with “Burning Love” (Number Two).\nMeanwhile, Presley’s personal life became the subject of countless tabloid headlines. Priscilla, from whom Presley had been separated since February 1972, refused to return to Graceland, and on his birthday in 1973 he filed for divorce. Less than a week later the TV special Elvis: Aloha From Hawaii was broadcast via satellite to over a billion viewers in 40 countries, an indication of his international appeal, although (with the exception of three dates in Canada in 1957 and an impromptu performance while on leave in Paris in 1959) Presley never performed outside the U.S. The special’s soundtrack album became his last Number One album in 1973.\nOutwardly, Presley appeared to have been given a second chance. He was more popular than ever, and the fan worship that would blossom into one of the biggest personality cults in modern history was taking hold. Offstage, however, Presley was plagued by self-doubt, poor management, and a basic dissatisfaction with his life. He repeatedly threatened to quit show business, but debts and his financial obligations to his large extended family, employees, and assorted hangers-on made that impossible. Unbeknownst to the public until after his death, Presley turned to drugs. Soon after he left the army, he became increasingly wary of the public and would often rent whole movie theaters and amusement parks to visit at night. By the late Sixties he was nearly a total recluse. Among the many books written by Presley by those who knew him, Priscilla’s account, Elvis and Me, goes so far as to suggest that he might have suffered a total nervous breakdown. Although it now seems clear that Presley was taking drugs — namely amphetamines — while in the service (and perhaps even before), his abuse of prescription drugs, including barbiturates, tranquilizers, and amphetamines, increased during the last years of his life. Several painful physical conditions may have initiated this trend. Ironically, he remained devoutly spiritual, never drank alcohol, and publicly denounced the use of recreational drugs. In one of his few unplanned excursions from Graceland, he actually showed up at the White House in 1970 to meet President Richard M. Nixon and received an honorary Drug Enforcement Administration agent’s badge. Days later he was given a special tour of FBI headquarters, where according to FBI files made public after Presley’s death, the singer offered to provide information on persons he believed were a bad influence on American youth.\nToward the end of his life, however, his onstage presence began to deteriorate. He would babble incoherently and rip his pants, having grown quite obese, and on at least one occasion he collapsed. Despite his clearly worsening health, he maintained a frantic tour schedule. This was due to the fact that in 1973 Colonel Parker had negotiated a complex deal whereby Presley sold back to RCA the rights to many of his masters in exchange for a lump-sum payment of which only $2.8 million came to him. Essentially, after 1973 Parker was earning nearly 50 percent commission (as opposed to the 10 percent industry standard). Worse, however, Presley was not earning any more royalties on sides recorded before 1973, although they continued to sell in the millions year after year. Parker’s need to satisfy personal gambling debts was said to be the reason for the self-serving deal. On top of it all, Presley opposed tax shelters on principle; he naively relied on his father for business advice; and he gave away expensive gifts and cash heedlessly. The result, by the mid-Seventies, was near-certain financial disaster.\nPresley’s last live performance was on June 25, 1977, in Indianapolis. He was reportedly horrified at the impending publication of Elvis: What Happened?, the tell-all written by three of his ex-bodyguards and Memphis Mafiosi that was the first printed account of his drug abuse and obsession with firearms, to name just two headline-grabbing revelations. The book came out on August 12. On August 16, 1977 — the day before his next scheduled concert — Presley was discovered by girlfriend Ginger Alden dead in his bathroom at Graceland. Although his death was at first attributed to congestive heart failure (an autopsy also revealed advance arteriosclerosis and an enlarged liver), later investigation revealed evidence that drug abuse may have been at least part of the cause of death. Because the family was allowed to keep the official autopsy report private, additional speculation regarding contributing factors in Presley’s death has run wild. Through the years, several insiders have insisted that he was suffering from bone cancer, to name just one unsubstantiated claim. In September 1979 Presley’s private physician, Dr. George Nichopoulos, was charged by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners with “indiscriminately prescribing 5,300 pills and vials for Elvis in the seven months before his death.” He was later acquitted.\nThousands gathered at Graceland, where Presley lay in state before he was buried in a mausoleum at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis. After attempts were made to break into the mausoleum, Presley’s body and that of his mother were moved to the Meditation Garden behind Graceland. Nearly two years later, his father, Vernon, died and was also buried there. With Vernon dead, all of Presley’s estate passed on to Lisa Marie.\nCourt battles over the estate ended in June 1983 after 21 months of litigation with a settlement that ended four lawsuits. One of the terms of the agreement called for Parker to turn over most of his interest in Presley’s audio and video recordings to RCA and the Presley family in return for a large monetary settlement. Lisa Marie’s court-appointed guardian ad litem, Blanchard Tual, wrote in his report on Presley’s financial affairs that Parker had “handled affairs not in Elvis’ but in his own best interest.” Parker died of a stroke in February 1997 at the age of 87. Priscilla Presley assumed control of the estate and through a number of business moves made the Presley estate many times more valuable than it had ever been during Elvis’ lifetime. The cornerstone of the Elvis Presley Enterprises, Inc. (EPE) financial empire is the Tennessee state law Priscilla Presley pushed for that guarantees to heirs the commercial rights to a deceased celebrity’s image and likeness. As a result, the name Elvis Presley is, technically speaking, a trademark, and anyone selling Presley-related merchandise in the U.S. must pay EPE an advance fee plus a royalty on every item sold.\nClaiming the funds were needed to maintain the property (the estate was valued at only $5 million in 1979 and the costs to maintain Graceland are estimated at nearly half a million dollars annually), Priscilla Presley opened Graceland to the public in the fall of 1982. Although it is not preserved in exactly the way Elvis Presley left it, and the second floor, where his bedroom is located, remains off-limits to the public, millions have come from all over the world to pay homage to the King of Rock & Roll. In 1991 Graceland was added to the National Register of Historic Places. At last count, around 600,000 people visit Graceland annually. In the mid-Nineties, the Presley estate was estimated to have been worth over $100 million. At the turn of the century, it was estimated that the presence of Graceland was responsible for bringing $100 million into the local Memphis economy. The Elvis Presley Charitable Foundation was created in 1985 by EPE to support various causes.\nPresley’s sole heir, Lisa Marie, married a fellow Scientology follower, Danny Keough, in 1988. They had two children: Danielle and Benjamin Storm. In 1993 they were divorced, and in May 1994 she married Michael Jackson. They divorced in 1996, after 18 months of marriage. In August 2005, Lisa Marie sold 85 percent of her share of the Presley estate to CKX Inc., which also owns 19 Entertainment, the company responsible for the American Idol TV show. Lisa Marie kept the Graceland property and most of its belongings. In February 2006, CKX announced its plan to increase Graceland’s tourist-destination profile.\nHundreds of books about Presley have been published in the U.S. alone. His enduring power as a cultural force is beyond the scope of this biography, but it has been examined by a number of authors, including Dave Marsh, Greil Marcus, and Peter Guralnick, to name a few. Guralnick’s award winning two-volume biography — Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley (1994) and Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley (1999) — is perhaps the closest to a definitive account of his life yet written. In 1986 Presley was among the first 10 performers inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2002, Presley’s “A Little Less Conversation,” from the Roustabout soundtrack (1968), was remixed by JXL (a.k.a. Junkie XL — the DJ-producer allowed his name to be truncated for the remix) and became a Number One U.K. hit, helping propel a new compilation, 30 Number1 Hits, to healthy sales worldwide. (It reached Number One itself in the U.S.) 30 Number One Hits was later followed by 2nd to None (Number Three, 2003), both of which were folded into a three-disc box titled Hitstory. Elvis' albums and songs have been reissued and repackaged with extra tracks countless times since his death, and in 2010, to celebrate his 75th birthday, RCA released yet another collection, the 100-song box set Elvis 75: Good Rockin' Tonight.\nPortions of this biography appeared in The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll (Simon & Schuster, 2001). Mark Kemp contributed to this story.\n\n"
