While technology has evolved since the Apollo era, NASA's first rovers are influencing manned and robotic vehicles for exploration on Mars and beyond.\n\"The LRV on Apollo fulfilled a very important need, which was to be able to cover large traverses, carry more samples, and get more scientific exploration done,\" Mike Neufeld, a curator in the space history division at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. told SPACE.com. \"It was a really important part of why Apollo 15, 16 and 17 were so much more scientifically advanced and productive.\" [ Photos: The Evolution of NASA's Moon Cars ]\nDriving on the moon\nApollo 15 was the fourth mission to land men on the moon, and it was the first of three missions to use the LRVs. The rover had a mass of about 460 pounds (208 kilograms) and was designed to fold up so it could fit inside a compartment of the Lunar Module.\nApollo 17 mission commander Eugene A. Cernan makes a short checkout of the Lunar Roving Vehicle during the early part of the first Apollo 17 extravehicular activity at the Taurus-Littrow landing site in 1972.\nCredit: NASA\n\"It was a very elegant little vehicle,\" Neufeld said. \"It had to be lightweight and had to be folded up in a very compact space. They were very successful – there were no major failures – so clearly it was a successful design.\" [ Video: NASA's 21st Century Moon Ride ]\nAnd they drove relatively well, Neufeld said, given the rocky terrain on the moon. The rovers could reach a top speed of about 8 mph (about 13 kph), but the moon's cratered surface prevented the astronauts from driving too fast.\n\"They weren't driving on flat land – it was more like a dirt buggy than anything else,\" he explained. \"It didn't travel that fast, but for the astronauts who drove it, it seemed like it was exciting and fast. It was a pretty bouncy ride. Even flat looking terrain on the moon is not very flat because there are so many crater pits, so it would have been a fairly exciting ride.\"\nThe lunar rovers also injected a new level of public enthusiasm for the Apollo program.\n\"Overall public interest had declined after Apollo 11,\" Neufeld said. \"The public was becoming more and more blasé. Apollo 15 provided a blip upwards in public interest. Part of it was because the landing site was so much more attractive, and there were also more television broadcasts from the moon. But, the rovers were definitely a part of that. The public took a lot of interest in this new capability that the astronauts had.\"\nThe LRVs allowed the Apollo astronauts to explore beyond their landing site, but there were definite limitations, such as the non-rechargeable battery life of the rovers. As a safety precaution, the vehicles were also constrained to a distance that, if the rover broke down, the astronauts would have enough resources in their life support systems to walk back to the Lunar Module.\nOn the Apollo 15 mission, the LRV was driven a total of about 17 miles (27 km), which amounted to 3 hours and 2 minutes of driving time, according to NASA officials.\nNASA's twin Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have been on the surface of Mars for more than eight years.\nCredit: NASA/JPL\nMoon rover legacy\nIn the decades since the end of the Apollo program, engineers have looked to the LRVs for cues on how to develop current and future manned and robotic rovers. [ Coolest Vehicles You'll Never Get to Ride ]\nAt NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif., engineers collaborated with Apollo-era designers to develop the vehicles for the Mars Pathfinder project. Even though past and current Mars rovers were designed to be robotic, studying the first manned lunar vehicles proved invaluable, said Kobie Boykins, an engineer in JPL's spacecraft mechanical and engineering division.\n\"There was a lot of information that we learned,\" Boykins told SPACE.com. \"We watched videos and saw how the NASA astronauts drove around on the rover. All the basic physics of how we interact with the soil stays the same even without having a human being in the rover. It helped us understand our capabilities and our limits. We needed to then figure out how to drive over rocks and drive on steeper inclines, but it's all applicable.\"\nBoykins and his team worked on the twin Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on Mars in January 2004 and have greatly outlasted their planned three-month lifespan. Spirit, which got stuck in sand, was declared dead by its operators earlier this year, but Opportunity is still driving steadily on the surface of the Red Planet.\nIn addition to being robotic, the Mars rovers differed from the Lunar Roving Vehicles because they drove at a much slower pace – about 2 inches per second (5cm/s).\n\"It's about the land speed of a Galapagos turtle,\" Boykins said. \"There were a lot of design ideas that came from the Apollo days, but the lunar rovers were orders of magnitude faster.\"\nFuture space car tech\nBoykins is also working on NASA's newest Mars rover, a car-sized robotic explorer named Curiosity , which is scheduled to launch into space in late November. But NASA teams are also involved in developing other rovers, ones that could eventually be driven by humans once again on the surface of the moon or Mars.\nDuring the 2008 Desert RATS tests at Black Point Lava Flow in Arizona, engineers, geologists and astronauts came together to test the surface version of the Space Exploration Vehicle.\nCredit: Regan Geeseman\nThe Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV) looks like a luxury RV compared to the more primitive-looking lunar rovers, but the Apollo program definitely put its stamp on this next generation vehicle, said Lucien Junkin, an engineer with the SEV project at NASA's Johnson Space Center.\nThe SEV engineers worked closely with Harrison Schmitt to design and test the new vehicle, which features an enclosed, pressurized cabin, 12 wheels and mounted spacesuits on the back. Schmitt, a former NASA astronaut, drove one of the original lunar rovers during the Apollo 17 mission, the final flight that rounded out the Apollo space program.\n\"We wanted to take all the lessons learned from the Apollo and Mars rovers and combine all that together, but also challenge conventional wisdom,\" Junkin told SPACE.com. \"With the SEV, we built what we call a feature-rich vehicle, so things like cargo, space and other creature comforts. We wanted to keep it simple but move it forward.\"\nThe SEV is designed to comfortably carry a two-astronaut crew on multiple day excursions. The vehicle was originally designed as part of the now-canceled Constellation program that was going to return astronauts to the moon. The engineering team is now designing and testing the vehicle to be compatible with future missions that could require rovers either on the moon or Mars, Junkin said.\n\"We have to stay away from the policy and keep our nose to the grindstone,\" he said. \"We want to keep developing a rover that is in America's garage, so when it's time for us to go to another heavenly body or another planet, America will be ready with a vehicle.\"\nYou can follow SPACE.com staff writer Denise Chow on Twitter @denisechow .

It’s the first off-planet automobile ride.\nForty years after Neil Armstrong made his giant leap for mankind , the Apollo program remains a singular cultural and technological achievement. The application of so much technology to a single goal was nearly without precedent. Amongst all the gadgetry born of the Apollo program, the lunar rover ranks near the top of the cool scale.\nThe rover was the most famous electric vehicle until that slick little two-seater from Tesla Motors came along, and it remains a technological marvel. The amount of tech packed into that little buggy still boggles the mind.\nThe rovers were used to give the astronauts greater leeway in exploring the moon during the later, more science-heavy Apollo missions . Those space suits are bulky, and walking in them wasn’t easy. So, having a set of wheels expanded the astronauts’ range, because they weren’t restricted to walking short distances.\nBoeing built the rover and needed just 17 short months to develop it. Not only did the rover have to carry two men wearing space suits, but it also had to haul whatever rocks and dirt the astronauts found interesting. The main design concerns were, as always, weight and performance.\nCost was not a big concern. The original budget was $19 million for four rovers. Cost overruns — in a government program? I’m shocked, shocked! — doubled the final price tag to $38 mil (worth about $200 million in today’s cash).\nThe rover didn’t arrive on the moon ready to roll. It was folded like a Transformer and packed into a cargo hold. When the time came, the astronauts used a system of pulleys, reels and tapes to lower the vehicle from the payload bay. After that, the rover took over. Its wheels unfolded automatically and locked into place as the rover opened like an Autobot .\nThe LRV was 10 feet, 2 inches long with a  7.5-foot wheelbase and a 6-foot tread width. It was less than 45 inches high.\nWeight is the enemy of all things that fly, especially those things flying into space. Boeing made the rover supermodel-light. It tipped the scales at a featherweight 463 pounds, a figure that must have made Colin Chapman swoon with envy.\nThe frame was made of welded 2219 aluminum-alloy tubing. Everything else was aluminum, magnesium or other exotic light alloys. Light, but strong: The little lunar runabout could carry a payload of 1,080 pounds.\nThe “tires” weren’t tires at all, but zinc-coated woven steel strands attached to the rim and discs of formed aluminum. On top of the zinc and steel mesh were titanium chevrons that covered 50 percent of the contact area to provide traction.\nThe electric motors — made by GM subsidiary Delco — mounted within the wheels. Each 54-amp DC series-wound motor cranked out 1.9 kilowatts at 10,000 rpm and was attached to its wheel by an 80:1 harmonic drive. The brakes were mechanically operated. Top speed on a smooth, level surface was about 8 mph.\nThe rover was controlled with a joystick-like T-shaped hand controller located between the two seats. It controlled the four drive motors, two steering motors and brakes. Push it forward and off you went. Pulling back slowed you down. Move the joystick in the direction you wanted to go and the rover turned. It was pretty much like using your Xbox.\nThe lunar rovers were used on the Apollo 15, 16 and 17 missions, and together they covered a little more than 55 miles. That doesn’t sound like much, but it gave the astronauts an upgrade in range, mobility and payload capacity that paid huge dividends in data.\nOn the other hand, it works out to $3.6 million per mile in 2009 dollars. MSRP = Moon Sure Rides Pricey.\nThree rovers were left in place on the lunar surface. The fourth was intended for the Apollo 18 mission, which was cancelled. That LRV (one owner, never been used) now lives at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.  The rig on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle is an original Boeing mock-up .\nBut as much rocket science as the Lunar Roving Vehicle had packed in it, it still had an owners manual, which you, the taxpayer, can download here .\nSource: Various\n\n"
