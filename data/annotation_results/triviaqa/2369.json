Unlike an accumulator (parlay) or single bet, it does not fail if a single selection is wrong.\nTake, for example, a typical Thoroughbred flat race meeting, with six races scheduled on a single day and a bettor who has ï¿½12 with which to wager. If one straight bet of ï¿½12 is made on a single horse to Win in the first race, no matter what the odds, all is lost if the selection fails to come in first, making for a very short afternoon of wagering.\nAlternatively, the bettor might choose to place ï¿½4 wagers on selected horses to Win in each of the first three races, for a total stake of ï¿½12ï¿½a so-called ï¿½combination betï¿½ made up of three singles. If at least one of the selections succeeds at odds of higher than 3/1, the betting will pay a profit. Similarly, two winners at average odds of above 2/3 would also yield a profit, and if all three win, it will be a happy day at the races indeed.\nIn this case, combination betting has reduced the risk. One or two losers will not necessarily cause all of the wagering to fail. The risk could be further reduced by staking ï¿½2 apiece on horses in each of the six races. A single winner paying better than 6/1 odds would ensure a profitable day.\nThe drawback, of course, is that the possibility of winning big is reduced when the bets are spread around in this way. Unless several selections are correct, only a small profit is returned.\nWith the appeal of long odds in mind, bookmakers offer ï¿½accumulators,ï¿½ joining two or more selections into a single wager at greater odds than would be returned if they were bet upon individually. Whatï¿½s more, the minimum cost of the accumulator is lower than that of making individual bets. The risk, of course, is that if a single selection fails, the entire stake is lost.\nTwo selections wagered on together are called a ï¿½double.ï¿½ Three selections taken as a unit are called a ï¿½treble.ï¿½ Accumulators of four, five or six selections are known as ï¿½four-fold,ï¿½ ï¿½five-foldï¿½ and ï¿½six-foldï¿½ accumulators, respectively.\nHereï¿½s where combination betting shows its true advantage. It allows a singles, doubles, trebles and other accumulators to be wagered upon as group. One of the most popular combination bets is a ï¿½Trixie.ï¿½ It consists of four wagers on three selections in different events, including three doubles and one trebleï¿½AB, AC, BC and ABC. If at least two of the selections succeed, the bettor will receive a return.\nIn much the same way, a ï¿½Yankeeï¿½ allows four selections in different events to be fully covered using eleven wagers. It includes six doubles, four trebles and an accumulatorï¿½AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD and ABCD. Again, if at least two of the selections succeed, a return is guaranteed.\nMuch more complex combination betting can be pursued. The ï¿½Super Yankeeï¿½ or so-called ï¿½Canadianï¿½ is made up of 26 wagers on five selections in different events. It includes ten doubles, ten trebles, five four-fold accumulators and one five-fold accumulator. At least two of the selections must succeed to receive a return.\nThe combination bet known as a ï¿½Heinzï¿½ covers six selections with 57 separate betsï¿½15 doubles, 20 trebles, 15 four-fold accumulators, 6 five-fold accumulators and one six-fold accumulator. The ï¿½Super Heinzï¿½ is made up of 120 bets covering seven selections in different events. It consists of 21 doubles, 35 trebles, 35 four-fold accumulators, 21 five-fold accumulators, seven six-fold accumulators and one seven-fold accumulator. In both instances, at least two selections must succeed in order for a return to be received.\nThe ï¿½Goliathï¿½ consists of 247 bets. It covers eight selections in different events with 28 doubles, 56 trebles, 70 four-fold accumulators, 56 five-fold accumulators, 28 six-fold accumulators, eight seven-fold accumulators and one eight-fold accumulator. At least two selections must succeed in order for a return to be received.\nWhen combination bets include all possible combinations of doubles, trebles and accumulators for a given number of selections, such as those named above, they are referred to collectively as ï¿½full cover bets.ï¿½ When they also include all possible singles, they are known as ï¿½full cover bets with singles.ï¿½\nComment on this article\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nAll Types of Bets and Combinations. ... a bet on four selections in a single event that yields a return ...

Stay on Sportingbet.ag and we will explain it all to you!\nFor starters, it is important to understand what are the odds set by bookmakers.\nOdds system:\nBefore you start betting on sports, you must understand the odds system.\nOnce you have chosen the sport and the event you want to bet on, you will receive a list of available markets provided by the bookmaker.\nBookmakers assign ratings to the various competitors or teams facing each other. The odd is a numerical representation of the bookmakerâ€™s prognosis.\nThis is calculated based on their estimated chances of victory or draw between two teams or the probability that an event takes place in a game.\nHow are displayed odds?\nThe odds can be displayed in 3 different ways: Fractional (1/2), Decimal (1.5) or American (- 200)\nWhat are American Odds?\nAmerican odds are also known as lines or money line odds. If American Odds are indicated with a + sign then they show the amount you would win for a $100 wager. If there is a – sign then they show how much you need to wager to win $100.\nE.g if you stake $10 on a +100 odd, you will receive $20 (including your returned wager with a net profit of $10). If you wager $10 on a -200 odd, you will receive $15 (including your returned stake, net profit of $5).\nIn this example, for a $10 bet on Bouchard your potential gain will be $10.83 (wager included)\nIf you bet $ 0 Mayr-Achleitner your potential gain will be $70.00 (wager included)\nWhat are Decimal Odds?\nDecimal odds are fairly simple. Basically, you multiply your stake by the decimal shown and the total is how much you’ll receive in winnings – including your wager.\nE.g. If you have odds of 4.00 and stake $10, you’ll receive $40 in winnings (including your returned wager, net profit of $30).\nThe above Tennis example will be displayed as follows in Decimal odds:\nWhat are Fraction Odds?\nFractional odds are also simple to calculate because they are given in fraction form. The denominator or 2nd number to the right is the amount bet and the numerator or 1st number on the left is the amount that your wager will return.\nThe above Tennis example will be displayed as follows in Fractional odds:\nE.g. If you have odds of 3/1 and stake $1, you’ll receive $3 in winnings (not including your stake).\nThis works on a ratio basis, so if you place $10 at 4/1, you’ll receive $40 winnings (not including your wager)\nOdds Equivalence\nBet types\nSingle: A bet on one selection in a chosen event.\nParlay/ Accumulator / Acca.:. A parlay also known as accumulator or acca is a single bet that links together two or more individual wagers and is dependent on all of those wagers winning together. The benefit of the parlay is that there are much higher payoffs than placing each individual bet separately since the difficulty of hitting it is much higher. If any of the bets in the parlay lose, the entire parlay loses.\n* Important: No matter how many games are included in the combination, if you bet $10 on the combination, only $10 will be debited from your balance.\nTrixie: This combination bet consists of four bets involving three selections from different events, At least two of our selections need to win in order to get a winning bet. If the player bet $1on this bet, $4 will be debited from his account\nMatch 1: Montreal @ San Jose\nForecast: Montreal at odds of +100\nMatch 2: Boston @ Philadelphia\nForecast: Match drawn at odds of +230\nMatch 3: Los Angeles @ Edmonton\nForecast: Edmonton at odds of +120\nThe total stake is $100, i.e. $25 per bet (there are 4 combinations)\nOutcome 1: None or just one of the forecasts is correct. The total stake is lost.\nOutcome 2: Two forecasts are correct: Montreal beats San Jose and Edmonton beats Los Angeles. This is therefore a winning double combination. Part of the total stake is returned.\nProfit = total stake / 4 * ((match 1 odds * match 3 odds) – 1) – (total stake / 4 * 3)\nProfit = 25 * ((2 * 2.2) – 1) – 75 = $10\nOutcome 3: All three forecasts are correct. Therefore, the three double combinations and the treble combination all win. The total stake is returned, along with a profit calculated as below :\nProfit = total stake / 4 * ((match 1 odds * match 2 odds * match 3 odds) – 1) + total stake / 4 * ((match 1 odds * match 2 odds) – 1)\n+ total stake / 4 * ((match 1 odds * match 3 odds) – 1)\n+ total stake / 4 * ((match 2 odds * match 3 odds) – 1)\nProfit = 25 * 13.52 + 25 * 5.6 + 25 * 3.4 + 25 * 6.26 = $719.5\n• Three doubles • One treble\nPatent: This combination bet consists of seven bets involving three selections from different events:\n• Three singles • Three doubles • One treble\nAt least one selection must win in order for you to get a return. A $1 patent has a total stake of $7.\nPatent is working the same way as a Trixie + 3 single bets.\nPoint Spread/ Handicap: When two teams meet on the playing field or on the court, one team is typically better than the other. In order to make it more exciting and remunerative, the traders are offering spread bets that allows an event to become more even if the sides are unevenly matched. The better team will receive a negative number of handicap goals/points which they must then overcome for the bet to win.\nEx: In MLS, Toronto are playing Houston. Toronto have been set as a 1 goal favourite on the betting line.\nThat means for Toronto to cover the spread that has been installed, they will need to win by at least 2 goals.\nHouston can cover the line with a loss by 1 goal or less, or obviously with a victory.\nIf Toronto win by exactly 2 goals, the bet would result in a push/ draw with no pay-outs.\nYankee: This combination bet consists of 11 bets involving four selections from different events.\n• Six doubles • Four trebles • One accumulator\nA minimum of two of your selections must win in order for you to get a return on your investment.

A $1 Goliath has a total stake of $247.\nPopular terms\nAnte-post: Ante post bets are bets placed in advance of the event. An advantage of this type of betting is that you may get a better price.The main disadvantage of ante post betting is that if your player doesn’t compete it is considered a loser – ante post bets are accepted all in run or not.\nCorrect score: This is a bet on the correct score of a match.\nDouble chance: This is a bet on two outcomes of a match. Three options are available to bet on: 1) either team 1 (home team) or team 2 (away team) wins; 2) team 1 (home team) wins or the match ends in a draw ; 3) Team 2 (away team) wins or the match ends in a draw\nThis type of bet is available for the regular time only.\nDouble result: The Double Result option offered by a bookmaker, particularly in soccer betting, is splitting the outcome of a match into two halves, with the result of both halves needing to be right to win. In straight forward soccer match betting, there are three possible betting outcomes, a Win, a Loss or a Draw. By splitting the bet over two halves, then the outcomes are increased to nine. Instead of the regular three, you will have a Win/Win, a Win/Draw, a Win/Loss, a Draw/Win, a Draw/Draw, a Draw/Loss, a Loss/Win, a Loss/Draw and a Loss/Loss.\nDraw no bet: A bet on this market means that if the match ends in a draw you get your stake back. Because of this the odds on the two teams are much lower than in the conventional Win-Draw-Win market\nEach-way: A bet that allows you to place equal stakes on a selection to win and/or be placed in an event. Place terms range from 2 to 5 places and are paid at between -200 to -500 of the win odds depending on the event. An each way bet will cost double the unit stake. E.g. $5 each way on Tiger Woods to win the PGA Championship at +400 with each way terms of 1/4 odds, 1,2,3,4,5 places will cost $10. If Tiger Woods wins the event, you receive your win stake multiplied by the win odds as well as your place stake multiplied by the place odds. If Tiger Woods doesn’t win but finishes in the top five, you will only have your place stake multiplied with the place odds\nEvens: This is a bet at the odds of 100. A $10 stake would return $20 ($10 win plus $10 wager).\nFavourite: The team, runner or competitor considered by the bookmaker to have more chance of winning than their opponents. The favourite is the shortest priced selection in an event.\nThree (Four etc.) Fold: When preceded by a number (3, 4 or more) in your bet slip, a ‘fold’ indicates the number of selections in an accumulator bet. A five-fold would be an accumulator with five selections, all of which must win for the bet to be successful.\nForecast: A forecast bet asks you to predict the selections that finish first and second in a race/event, in that order. A reverse forecast will cost twice as much but allows the selections to finish first and second in any order.\nMultiple: This refers to bets on a number of selections in different events. A double and upwards is a type of multiple.\nNon-runner: A competitor that does not end up taking part in the event which he/she was intended to run.\nOdds against: An ‘odds against’ selection is any selection priced at above 100.\nOdds-on: An ‘odds on selection is any selection priced at below 100.\nOdds on is the term used to describe a bet where you will need to stake more than you will win.\n \nOutright winner: The overall winner of a tournament or competition.\nReturns: The money you receive in your account for successful bets. Winnings plus stake\nScorecast: This is a bet on the first player to score a goal in a match, and on the correct score at the end of a match. Both results must be correct for the bet to be a winner. An example of a scorecast would be  PHIL KESSEL  2-0 –  PHIL KESSEL to score the first goal in a 2-0 win for Toronto Maple Leafs.\nWager / Stake: The amount of money that you place on your selection.\nStarting price: The final price of a horse before the race begins.\nVoided bet: A bet that must be cancelled for a particular reason (could be withdrawal of a player/team, game postponed or other). In this case the bet is deemed invalid and the wagered amount is returned.\nWinning margin: This is a bet on the margin of points between the winning and losing team. E.g. If Team A beats Team B 19 – 10 then the winning margin is 9 points. Winning Margin bets are often bracketed up into five point segments like 0-5 points, 6-10 points, 11-15 points etc.\nIn play Betting\nIn-play betting: With in:play betting you can place wagers on the offered markets and odds on events while the action takes place.
