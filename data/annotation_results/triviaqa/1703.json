BBC News - Labour MP Nigel Griffiths to quit at election BBC News - Labour MP Nigel Griffiths to quit at election\nLabour MP Nigel Griffiths to quit at election\nNigel Griffiths has been the Edinburgh South MP for 23 years\nFormer Labour minister Nigel Griffiths has announced he will quit as MP for Edinburgh South at the next election.\nMr Griffiths, who has held the marginal seat for 23 years, said he was leaving the Commons to take up a \"once in a lifetime job offer\".\nThe politician was recently hit with allegations concerning his private life and the Westminster expenses scandal.\nThe announcement brings the number of Scottish Labour MPs stepping down so far to nine.\nMeanwhile, former West Lothian Council leader Graeme Morrice has been selected as the Labour candidate in Livingston, after sitting MP Jim Devine was deselected by the party's special endorsement panel following a probe of his expenses claims.\nBrian Taylor\nPolitical editor\nThere is always churn at election time, but it does look as if the turnover will be substantial this time around.\nThus far, nine Scottish Labour MPs are retiring/departing before a vote is cast.\nOne Lib Dem, John Barrett, has announced that he is to go.\nThe SNP's cohort - with the exception of Alex Salmond - are all seeking re-election as is the solitary Tory.\nRead Brian Taylor's blog\nLabour MSP Cathy Jamieson, the former Scottish justice minister, will fight Kilmarnock and Loudoun after former defence and Scottish secretary Des Browne announced he was quitting the seat.\nAnd former civil servant and trade union official Michael McCann has been unveiled as the Labour candidate in East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, after former defence minister Adam Ingram also decided to quit as the sitting MP.\nLabour paid tribute to Mr Griffiths as one of Scotland's most experienced parliamentarians.\nAnd the party moved quickly to declare Labour support in Edinburgh South - which is being targeted by the other main parties in the forthcoming election - was \"strong and growing\".\nMr Griffiths, whose new post as director of an international education institution based in London, the United States and India, starts in June, said he firmly believed Labour would hold the seat.\nThe former councillor said: \"After 30 years of continuously elected service in Edinburgh, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\n\"It would not be right to delay accepting this position, since I want to give the party time to select a new candidate to fight the forthcoming election.\"\nTrident protest\nMr Griffiths, a long-time friend of Gordon Brown, last year escaped a standards investigation after the News of the World reported he cheated on his wife inside the House of Commons.\nIn a statement following the newspaper's account of events on Remembrance Day in 2008 he said at the time: \"I am, of course, ashamed that my conduct did fall below acceptable standards. I have little recollection of the evening but that does not make it right.\"\nLast summer it was reported Mr Griffiths tried to defend a £3,600 claim for a television, DVD player and digital radio in his London home by saying he had to listen to \"Scottish radio\" and watch \"Scottish TV\".\nHe was said to have told the Commons fees office a flat-screen television was the \"sensible option\" in a cramped flat, but did not pursue the claim after being told that, while the explanation was understandable, the \"level of purchases\" remained under question.\nMr Griffiths has served as a minister for construction, competition and enterprise.\nHe became deputy Leader of the Commons in 2005, but quit two years later so he could vote against the government on Trident.\nBookmark with:\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nJane Hunt is candidate for the forthcoming Leicester ...

As we reported in early July:\n\"Last month the Canadian-owned train manufacturer Bombardier lost a tendering process to build 1,200 railway carriages for the Bedford to Brighton 'Thameslink' service. The winner of that bidding process was the German-based Siemens. Today it's been  announced  that 1,400 jobs will be lost at Bombardier's Derby factories - many of them hi-skilled engineering posts.\"\nRob Hayward: The boundary reviews. What do we know?\nRob Hayward is an elections analyst and the former Conservative MP for Kingswood. He has been kindly keeping ConHome readers up-to-date with the review. See his previous contributions here and here .\nA lot is likely to be said in coming months about alternative plans for the required boundary reviews in relation to each county and country, however given the scale of the change that will arise from the forthcoming changes it is probably worth setting out the basic ground rules which will apply.\nReductions\nAcross the UK there will be 50 fewer MPs elected at the 2015 General Election than 2010. The reductions will be as follows:\nEngland -31\nI linked earlier this morning to Sky News's summary of the result, but here it is in full for the record:\nIain McKenzie (Lab) 15,118 (53.8%, -2.2%)\nAnne McLaughlin (SNP) 9.280 (33%, +15.5%)\nDavid Wilson (Con) 2,784 (9.9%, -2.1%)\nSophie Bridger (LD) 627 (2.2%, -11.1%)\nMitch Sorbie (UKIP) 288 (1%, -0.2%)\nLabour majority: 5,838 (20.8%, -17.6%)\nTurnout: 28,097 (45.4%, -18%)\nThree quick points:\nAlthough Labour's majority was slashed by more than half, its share of the vote scarcely moved.  The explanation for the much reduced majority was the Salmond-driven SNP surge.\nThe 2.2 per cent Liberal Democrat total could well be a foretaste of what's likely to happen in a general election in seats in which that party isn't a competitor.\nOur share scarcely moved either.  It had presumably pretty much hit the bottom already.  Odd to think that part of the seat was once part of a Conservative-held constituency - Renfrew West and Inverclyde .\nFollow Tim on Twitter .\nOn the same day I write in The Sunday Telegraph praising the new generation of Conservative MPs, a nameless Tory MP - who has \"spent many years in the Commons\" - has written an article for today's Mail on Sunday which attacks the Class of 2010 on multiple fronts...\nThey are mates of Cameron and Osborne, political chameleons and careerists: \"Top of the list were their friends who went to the same school or moved in the same social circle. Or women with degrees from smart universities who could glide through the Tory death-by-canapé drinks parties with flawless received pronunciation – even if they had been Labour members only yesterday. Then there were the ambitious sycophants and plain old careerists who would sell their own grandmother for a pat on the back or a wink from a whip.\"\nThey are cliquey: \"Tory MPs who entered Parliament at the last Election behave as if they are the first-ever intake, oblivious to the unspoken rules of the Commons, the subtleties that it takes years to learn. Instead, they arrived with a born-to-rule arrogance and tossed aside these courtesies. For example, there is a longstanding custom in the tea room that after you buy your food you take the next vacant seat at the first available table. It is designed to ensure no MP has to eat alone. Parliament can be a lonely place. This went out of the window with the 2010 intake, who walk past members in search of one of their own clique, or snub someone they feel is out of favour with the whips or Cameron. The same happens in the bars, as they kept to their own group, openly nervous about whom they are seen talking to.\"\nAnna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe recently profiled by Paul Goodman and a hot tip for rapid promotion, comes in for special criticism. She is called out for her \"unpleasant personal verbal attack\" on Mark Pritchard before last week's circus vote at a meeting of the 1922 Committee:\n\"From the day Anna arrived in Parliament, her zealous enthusiasm for every dot and comma of Cameron’s Tory modernisation programme has been painfully obvious. A female MP told me rather harshly it doesn’t help that Anna ‘looks as if she is sucking on a lemon’.Anna seemed to blame Mark for effectively putting Tory MPs on the spot in a Commons vote on banning animals in circuses. Mark is passionate about animal welfare. But Cameron couldn’t stomach the thought of a backbencher having influence over Government policy, even one as minor as circus animals – though a ban has 92 per cent public support. The word went out from No 10: ‘Kill Mark.’ Perhaps it is sheer coincidence that Anna is Parliamentary Private Secretary to Simon Burns MP, Minister of State for Health, who is a close personal friend of Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin and was also a long-serving whip  prior to becoming a Minister.\"\nRead the full piece which also includes strong attacks on David Cameron's approach to party management.\nAs MPs, new and old, gather tomorrow in the tea room you can be sure that there'll be one top topic of conversation: Who wrote that Mail on Sunday article?\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter\nFollowing the very sad death of Labour MP David Cairns last month, a by-election is pending in the West of Scotland constituency of Inverclyde.\nSky News were reporting last night that the writ for the by-election will be moved this afternoon for a contest on June 30th.\nI am reliably informed that the Conservative candidate is poised to be David Wilson (pictured), who contested the seat at last year's general election. A retired businessman, he is a member of Inverclyde Council and active in a variety of organisations in the local community.\nHe will be formally adopted as candidate at a meeting tomorrow.\nThe result at the general election was:\nLabour - 20,933 (56.0%)\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter\nA statement has just arrived in my inbox out of the blue from James Arbuthnot, the Conservative MP for North East Hampshire, to the effect that he will not stand as a candidate at the next general election:\n\"It has been a great privilege to have represented North East Hampshire for the last fourteen years, and before that Wanstead and Woodford for ten. My constituents have been generous and supportive and have taught me much. Their friendship has meant a great deal to Emma and me, and we shall always be grateful to them.\n\"After a fulfilling career, first as a barrister and then in Parliament, it is now right to move on at a time when I can still take on new challenges. My Chairmanship of the Defence Select Committee, an especially rewarding role, comes to an end at the end of this Parliament.  That will be the right moment to step down.\"\nArbuthnot was MP for Wanstead and Woodfood between 1987 and 1997, but on its abolition ahead of the 1997 election, he was selected to contest North East Hampshire, which he has represented ever since. He served as Opposition Chief Whip throughout William Hague's time as Tory leader.\nHis announcement comes on the day that new research will be focusing MPs' minds on the effects of the reduction in parliamentary seats that will come with the boundary changes which come into force at the next election.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter\n\"Lib Dems face crisis over new electoral map\", screams the headline on the front of this morning's Guardian .\nIt is reporting on what it suggests is the \"most detailed analysis yet\" of the likely outcome of the review of constituency boundaries currently being undertaken by the various Boundary Commissions.\nThe research, conducted by a Democratic Audit - a research group based at Liverpool University - maps the results of last year's general election onto a set of boundaries based on a 600-seat House of Commons, which is the number of constituencies that will exist at the 2015 general election.\nIt suggests that each of the parties would have won fewer seats, as follows:\nConservatives - 16 (5.2% of the party's seats)\nLabour - 17 (6.6%)\nLib Dems - 14 (24.6%)\nFollow Matthew on Twitter .\nReading Dewi at Slugger O'Toole's analysis of the Scottish election results - and the fact the SNP were only a few thousand votes short of an even more stunning victory, such was the small size of the Lab/Con/Lib majority in a number of Holyrood seats - I was reminded of the fragility of a number of Conservative Westminster seats.\nWhen examining our performance in last year's general election, an often over-looked fact is that many, almost certainly the majority, of Conservative MPs who won their seats last year from Labour, have smaller majorities than their Labour predecessors had in 1997.\nThis should be a cause for concern. If there was an election in a month's time, and even if the parties were level, at, say, 37%/37% and the Lib Dems on 10%, electoral calculators show Labour would win back tens of seats we gained last year.\nFollow Tim on Twitter .\nPaul Goodman wrote about the review of the candidates' list on Friday. More dramatic accounts appear in two Sunday newspapers;\n\"‘Tatler Tories’ ditched in purge of the right\" is how The Sunday Times (£) reports it. It reports that \"The clear-out sparked concern this weekend about the criteria used to remove people from the list, and the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs will discuss the matter next week when parliament returns from the Whitsun break.\" It names Deborah Dunleavy, Mark Clarke and Annunziata Rees-Mogg has three candidates who have been removed from the list.\nAnnunziata Rees-Mogg's fate is the focus of the Mail on Sunday's story . Tory MP Andrew Bridgen MP is suspicious of the criteria that CCHQ has used:\n\"It is entirely wrong to  treat some of our staunchest supporters in this way. Our grassroots supporters, who deliver leaflets and fund the running of the party, must be given a choice of candidates who reflect their views. Failure to do so will risk repeating the mistakes of the “A-list”, which demoralised a large section of our membership and support network... We should be drawing up a candidates list to win an outright majority – not end up in another coalition.\"\nPaul suggested that the candidates list was being cut to about 700. My understanding is that about 150 to 200 people have been 'culled'. Anecdotally a good number of these candidates do appear to be right-wingers but it is only that; anecdotal evidence.\nParty members will be suspicious because of the A-list experience. Examination of the electoral performance of candidates included on the original A-list revealed that many candidates had badly under-performed candidates who had been excluded from the list.\nPaul Goodman reported that there will be no new A-list. In reality that means that no new A-list will be published. Tory HQ will be operating an informal list of preferred candidates. Many candidates are kept on the big list because they are donors or friends of high ups. That doesn't mean they are recommended to Conservative Associations when selections are taking place.\nFollow Paul on Twitter\nSpirits are being raised and dreams shattered as I write.  The post-election assessment process for those on the old candidates' list is over.  Letters have been sent from CCHQ to those who were on it, letting them know whether or not their names are still to remain on.  The signature at the bottom of those letters is that of Carlyn Chisholm.  Jonathan reported last year that she was to co-chair the Candidate Committee with Baroness Browning .\nI saw Chisholm earlier this week at CCHQ, and write briefly about her background below.  But facts first - those that are available, at any rate.  CCHQ won't say how large a list it's aiming for - when I floated a figure of a thousand, Chisholm told me that \"it won't be as high as that\" - but I gather from other sources that it will most likely settle down at about 700.  Unsurprisingly, CCHQ is keeping mum about how many people have been removed from the old list.  There will be no \"A-list\".\nParliamentary Assessment Boards will start soon and carry on all the way through until 2015, assuming the Parliament lasts that long.  However, the new constituency boundaries don't come into effect until late 2013.  This raises a question: if a candidate passes a board this summer, what is he or she going to do for the next two and a half years?  The answer is that each one will choose a region to be assigned to, and be expected to work there.  I expect that attendance at by-elections will be compulsory.\nAlan \"Howling Laud\" Hope (Monster Raving Loony)\nJane Hunt (Conservative, pictured)\nAbhijit Pandya (UKIP)\nThe last time there were as few as five candidates contesting a by-election was in Cheadle in 2005, so Lib Dem blogger Jonathan Calder can sleep soundly in the knowledge that his prediction that \" this is no Barnsley Central: we are not going to finish sixth \" will come to fruition.\nThe result in the seat at last year's general election was:\nLabour - Sir Peter Soulsby                    21,479  45.6% (+6.2)\nLiberal Democrat - Parmjit Singh Gill    12,671  26.9% (-3.7)\nConservative - Ross Grant                    10,066  21.4% (+3.6)\nBNP - Adrian Waudby                             1,418    3.0% (+3.0)\nGreen - Dave Dixey                                    770   1.6% (-1.6)\nUKIP - Christopher Lucas                           720   1.5% (+1.5)\nJane Hunt is candidate for the forthcoming Leicester South by-election, taking place on May 5th.\nWe need Conservatives across the country to come and help in the Leicester South parliamentary by-election.\nThere's a great opportunity here.

We tend to use the term margin to refer ... The percentage of primary vote recorded by a party or candidate at an election, ... Glossary of Election Terms. Australian Broadcasting ... Glossary of Election Terms. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)\nZ\nAbove-the-line Voting\nAt Senate elections, candidates are grouped in columns across the ballot paper. A thick horizontal line runs across the ballot paper, and voters have the option of voting above the line for a single group, or voting below the line indicating preferences for all candidtaes on the ballot paper. Above the line voting is properly known as group ticket voting , but has become more commonly known as above-the-line voting. At Federal elections, roughly 95% of voters will vote above the line. For major parties, the rate is 98-99%, and for minor parties, 80-90%. In Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, where Hare-Clark voting is used local elections, only 80% of voters use the above the line option.\nAbsent vote\nVoters who are outside their own electorate on election day but within the same state or Territory can cast an Absent Vote at any polling place. An Absent Vote is a type of Declaration vote . As the voter is outside their electorate, they cannot have their name marked off the electoral roll. Instead, the voter is given a declaration envelope on which they fill in their personal details. After casting their vote, the ballot papers are sealed into the envelope. All Absent votes are returned to their 'home' division within days of polling. The ballot paper will not be opened and admitted to the count until the details on the outside of the envelope have been verified against the electoral roll. Around 850,000 absent votes were issued and around 750,000 admitted to the count in 2001, 6.2% of the total vote. The votes not admitted were for voters who were not on the roll in the electorate they tried to vote for, or where there was some other discrepancy in the declaration. Where a voter was not on the roll in their electorate, but were on the roll at that address within the same state, the Senate ballot paper would be admitted even though the House vote was rejected.\nAbsolute Majority\nAn absolute majority is one where the winning candidate achieves more than half of the vote in the count. An absolute majority is required for victory under preferential voting . This is as opposed to a plurality or simple majority, all that is required under first past the vote electoral systems. Under optional preferential voting, an absolute majority is defined as a majority of the votes remaining in the count after the exclusion of ballot papers with exhausted preferences.\nAssisted Voting\nVisually impaired, physically incapacitated or illiterate voters may be assisted in casting their ballot at a polling booth. This assistance may be by a person nominated by the voter, or in special circumstances, by a polling official. Voters who are unable though disability of illness to to enter a polling place may have voting materials taken to them outside the polling places. All votes cast with assistance at polling booths are simply classed as ordinary votes .\nReturn to Top\nBelow-the-line Voting\nAt Senate elections, candidates are grouped in columns across the ballot paper. A thick horizontal line runs across the ballot paper, and voters have the option of voting above the line for a single group, or voting below the line indicating preferences for all candidates on the ballot paper. Above the line voting is properly known as group ticket voting , and voting below the line has become more commonly known as below-the-line voting. Nationally, only 5.1% of voters voted below the line in 2001, with higher rates for minor party voters, and in Tasmania and the ACT where the Hare-Clark electoral system is used for local elections. The difficulty with voting below-the-line is that preferences must be shown for all candidates, a complex task when more than 60 candidates may nominate in the larger states. Formality rules for below-the-line votes allow up to three numbering errors before a vote is declared informal. The preferences of all below-the-line votes are entered into a computer system which is used to both determine the formality of votes and to conduct the complex Senate count.\nBy-election\nAn election in a single electorate in between general elections. Between 1901 and 2004, there were 140 by-elections. Of these, 67 were caused by the death of an MP, 67 as a result of resignation, five by voided elections and one by the expulsion of an MP. Significantly, from 1901 to 1970, 63.3% of by-election were caused by death and 31.6% by resignation. Since 1971, 11.9% have been caused by death and 85.7% by resignation. In the modern era, political parties rarely allow their MPs to continue to serve past 70, and the provision of generous superannuation schemes has allowed MPs to retire rather than serve until death overtakes them.\nReturn to Top\nCaretaker Government\nOne of the conventions of Australian politics is that once an election is called, the government goes into 'caretaker' mode. Ministers continue to administer the Commonwealth, but are not able to make major policy decisions or appointments. The caretaker period continues after polling day until it is clear who will form the new government. With up to 10 days allowed for the receipt of postal votes, very close elections may extend the caretaker period into the second week after polling day. If no clear majority is produced by the election, the pre-election government may continue in office in caretaker mode until the new parliaments sits and its numbers can be tested in the House of Representatives. The caretaker period in Australia is quite different to the United Kingdom, where in 1997, Tony Blair's clear victory was followed the next morning by the strange site of vans moving out the furniture of John Major from the rear of 10 Downing Street.\nCasual Vacancy\nA vacancy in the Senate caused by death or resignation. By-elections are not held for Senate vacancies. Instead, the relevant state or territory appoints a new Senator to fill the vacancy. Usually this is approved by a joint sitting of the state parliament. After the introduction of proportional representation in the Senate in 1949, it became a convention that the state appointed a Senator from the same party as the departing Senator. As well, replacement Senators used to face an election at the next House or Senate election. So at the separate 1972 House election, Neville Bonner faced an election for the single Senate seat he had been appointed to, and in 1974, the appointment of Vince Gair as Ambassador to Ireland was an attempt to change the number of Senate vacancies in Queensland from 5 to 6. (A double dissolution for all 10 seats was called in the end.) Then in 1975, the convention on Senate vacancies was broken. First, NSW Premier Tom Lewis appointed Albury Mayor Cleaver Bunton to the vacancy caused by the elevation of Labor's Lionel Murphy to the High Court. Then Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen appointed Pat Field on the death of Labor's Bert Milliner. As a result of these various fiddles of Senate vacancies, the Fraser government put up a referendum in 1977 so that vacancies must go to the party a departing Senator represented at the time of their election. The referendum was passed and faced its first test over the resignation of Senator Steele Hall, elected for the Liberal Movement in 1974, though by 1977 he had re-joined the Liberal Party. The Dunstan government in South Australia appointed Janine Haines to the vacancy, deciding the Australian Democrats were the successor party to the Liberal movement. In 1987, the Labor Party nominated John Devereux for a vacancy caused by the resignation of Don Grimes, but the Tasmanian parliament rejected his nomination and the seat remained vacant until the 1987 election. Note that the casual vacancy goes to the party that held the seat at the time of election, not the party they represent at the time of their departure.\nCoalition\nFormally, any political agreement between two or more parties. In Australia, the term Coalition tends to be used as a proper nount to describe the semi-permanent relationship between the two non-Labor Parties. Federally, a Coalition agreement has existed for almost all the time since a the first Coalition government was formed in 1923 between the Nationalist Party and the Country Party. The Nationalist Party later became the United Australia Party and now the Liberal Party, while the Country Party became the National Party and now the Nationals. Generally, the two parties do not contest each others seats if there is a sitting member. Labor seats, and Coalition seat with no sitting MP, are open for both parties to contest, though in recent years the two parties have tended to avoid these three-cornered contests with the Labor Party. Such a long lasting Coalition would have been unlikely without preferential voting , as it allows the two parties to co-operate at the national level even while local branches are competing against each other.\nCompulsory Voting\nIt is normal shorthand to say that Australia has a system of compulsory voting, but the term is not technically correct. Australians face two compulsions, compulsory enrolment and compulsory attendance at polling places. All Australian citizens 18 years and over must register on the electoral roll. Australia maintains a permanent electoral register with a rolling update, voters able to enrol or change their details at any time, except for the period between the close of rolls and polling day, usually 3-4 weeks. Compulsory electoral enrolment is not unusual, and also exists in other countries such as the United Kingdom. What is unusual in Australia is that once on the electoral roll, a voter must make the effort to vote. You must attend a polling place on election day, or make use of the liberal opportunities to vote by post, ahead of the election at pre-poll voting centres, or by voting absent at booths outside of your electorate. While you must attend, have your name crossed off the roll, accept a ballot paper and deposit it in a ballot box, you are not actually forced to mark a vote on the ballot paper. The ballot is secret, so you cannot be forced to vote. Electors who are not marked off the roll as having voted will receive a penalty notice for a $20 fine. The fine will be waived if a reasonable excuse is offered. Voters also have the option of taking the matter to court, at which stage a $50 fine can be imposed along with court costs. If the voter refuses to pay this fine, the matter becomes one of how the courts in each state deal with non-payment of court imposed fines. The Electoral Commission does not send people to gaol for refusing to vote, but once a voters refuses to pay a court ordered fine, it becomes a matter for the administration of justice. It is extremely rare for voters to take the fine for non-voting so far through the legal system. Technically, voters can also be fined for not putting their name on the electoral roll, but no fine will be levied if the unregistered voter fills in an enrolment form.\nReturn to Top\nDeclaration Vote\nA Declaration vote is any vote where instead of the voter being marked off the electoral roll when voting, the voter makes a declaration that they are on the roll in their electorate. The voter fills in their personal details on a declaration vote envelope and signs the required declaration. After voting, the ballot papers are then sealed in the envelope. The vote will not be taken from the envelope and counted unless the declaration first matches personal details on the electoral roll. Declaration envelopes can only be opened once the preliminary scrutiny has accepted the voter was entitled to cast a vote. Once the envelope is opened and the vote admitted to the count, the vote cannot be excluded on the basis of details on the declaration envelope. The opening of the envelopes and removal of ballot papers is conducted in such a manner that the secrecy of the ballot is not breeched. Four main types of declaration votes exist. Votes cast prior to election day can be either a Postal Vote , where ballot papers are mailed to the voter, or a Pre-poll Vote cast in person at early voting centres. On election day, voters can vote outside their own division using an Absent Vote , or if they turn up to vote and their name is not on the electoral roll, they can cast a Provisional Vote . At the 2001 election, 84% of votes were ordinary votes , 6% were absent votes, 5%� Pre-poll votes, 4% postal votes and under 1% provisional votes.\nDeposit\nAn amount of money deposited with a returning officer with the lodgement of a nomination to contest election. The deposit is $350 in the House of Representatives and $700 for each candidate in the Senate. The deposit is returned if the candidate is elected or receives more than 4% of the vote. In the Senate, the test is if the group achieves 4% or a candidate from the group is elected. All deposits not returned are forfeited.\nDissolution\nThe technical term for when a house of the parliament is dissolved for an election. This occurs to the House of Representatives at every election, and for the Senate at a double dissolution. Calling an election involves dissolving the House and issuing writs for an election. Generally this is done on the same day, but up to 10 days is allowed between the dissolution of the House and the issue of writs. The House is dissolved by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister. If the House of Representatives has not previously been dissolved, it expires three years after the first sitting following a Federal election. The only election to have taken place following dissolution by the 'effluxion of time' occurred in 1910. Note that a half-Senate election does not involve a dissolution, as Senators are elected for fixed terms and remain after an election until their terms expire.\nDonkey Vote\nA vote which simply numbers down the ballot paper starting with 1 for the first candidate. Donkey voting appears to be a consequence of compulsory voting and preferential voting . Many people who in other countries would not bother to vote are forced to turn out and vote in Australia. Then they have to fill in a ballot paper where all candidates are required to be numbered. People with no knowledge of the candidates who simply 'donkey vote' straight down the ballot paper appears to be one of the consequences. Since party names began to be printed on ballot papers, the donkey vote appears to have fallen, voters at least able to distinguish which party a candidate represents. The Donkey vote was once estimated to be 2-3%, but in more recent times appears to be less than one percent. While reduced, this donkey vote effect can still have an impact in close contests, which is why candidates are always keen to be drawn at the top of the ballot paper.\nDouble Dissolution\nA unique creation of the Commonwealth constitution. At the time of Federation, the small colonies were concerned that the larger colonies would dominate the Parliament, so the American idea of all states having equal representation in the Senate was adopted. However, the larger colonies, especially New South Wales, were not keen on joining a federation in which the smaller states could continually use the Senate to over-ride the will of a popularly elected government in the House of Representatives. The solution was the double dissolution power. If government legislation was blocked, delayed or unacceptably amended by the Senate, and after a period of three months the legislation faced the same blockage, the government had the right to request a double dissolution in which both the House and the whole of the Senate faced the electorate at the same time. If after this election, the Senate still refuses to accept the government's legislation, the government had the right to call a joint sitting of the two houses at which the blocked legislation could be passed into law with a simple majority of the sitting.There have been six double dissolutions. In 1914, the Cook government called the first double dissolution and was defeated. In 1951, the Menzies government called a double dissolution and won a majority in the Senate, so a joint sitting was not required. In 1974, the Whitlam government called a double dissolution, and when the Senate continued to block the bills, the one and only joint sitting was called to pass the blocked bills. In 1975, the Whitlam government was dismissed by the Governor-General and new Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser called a double dissolution based on blocked Whitlam government bills. Fraser won a Senate majority but was not interested in passing the legislation. In 1983, Malcolm Fraser called a double dissolution and was defeated. In 1987, Bob Hawke called a double dissolution based on the blockage of the Australia Card legislation. He won the election but abandoned the legislation amidst rising opposition, it also having become apparent that regulations required for the operation of the Australia Card would be overturned by the new Senate.\nReturn to Top\nElectoral Commission\nCommonwealth elections are conducted by an Independent body called the Australian Electoral Commission, the AEC. Each of the states and territories conduct their own elections and have their own electoral bodies, some set up as a commission, others as departments or offices. Where in other countries elections are administered by local government authorities, Australian elections are always administered at the level of government being contested. The AEC administers both the election and the permanent administration of the electoral roll. The roll is maintained by a joint agreement between the AEC and the various state bodies. Electoral Commissions are usually represented on the separate commissions that draw up electoral boundaries.\nElectorate\nAn electorate is a geographic sub-division which elects members of Parliament. It is also referred to as an electoral district or electoral division or just simply a division. Equivalent overseas terms are 'constituency' in the United Kingdom, 'riding' in Canada and 'district' in the United States.Australia is currently divided into 150 electorates, each of which elects one member to the House of Representatives. Seats are allocated to States and Territories based on formulas set out in the Constitution and the Electoral Act. Original states are guaranteed a minimum of five seats, which means Tasmania is slightly over-represented compared to other states. Electorates are allocated to states on the basis of population, not electoral enrolment. However, boundaries of electorates within each state are drawn to ensure seats have approximately equal electoral enrolment, not equal population. Redistributions take place at regular intervals to maintain electorates within permitted variation from average.In Australia, the word electorate is also often used as a collective noun to describe voters. It is common political shorthand to talk about 'the electorate', as in political leaders 'facing the electorate'.\nExhausted Preferences\nBallot papers on which it is not possible to determine a next valid preference are said to 'exhaust' their preferences. Under optional preferential voting , this may be simply because no further preferences are shown, and the ballot paper is excluded from the final two-candidate preferred count.\nReturn to Top\nFirst Past The Post Voting\nPlurality or simple majority voting, as used in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The candidate with the highest vote wins, or in horse racing terminology, the first candidate past the post. First past the post voting has not been used for House of Representatives elections since the introduction of preferential voting in 1918.\nReturn to Top\nGerrymander\nA gerrymander is the deliberate drawing of electoral boundaries to gain political advantage. It is not the same as a malapportionment , as electorates can be equal in enrolment and still be gerrymandered. The word 'gerrymander' forever commemorates Elbridge Gerry, elected Governor of the US state of Massachusetts in 1810. Governor Gerry embarked on re-drawing the boundaries of seats in the state Senate to the extent that his party won 29 of the 40 seats despite obtaining only a minority of the vote. One of the new seats drawn bore some resemblance to a salamander, the new word Gerry-mander coined as part of the campaign to discredit the electoral boundaries.\nGroup (Senate)\nOn ballot papers for the Senate, candidates are grouped together in columns. Any party or group of individuals nominating two or more candidates is entitled to their own column, though sitting MPs are given the right to nominate on their own as a group. Groups can consist of Independents nominating together as a group, of members from a single party, or as members from more than one party standing as a single group. For instance, in several state the Liberal and the National Parties nominate a single list of candidates.\nThe order candidates appear within each group is fixed, determined by the party or individuals nominating. While the position of the groups (columns) on the ballot paper is fixed, the order is determined by a random draw. It is generally considered that a position to the left of the ballot paper is advantageous, and drawing the first group on the ballot paper may give and extra half to one percent of the vote. (See donkey vote .)\nPrior to 1940, group order on the ballot paper was determined by a formula that looked at the alphabetic order of the candidates in each group. At the 1937 NSW Senate election, the Labor Party nominated three candidates whose names all started with 'A', so grabbing the first column on the ballot paper and leading to the introduction of the random draw for position.\nElections for the Tasmanian and Australian Capital Territory local parliaments are conducted using a similar system called Hare-Clark voting. Like the Senate, there is a draw used to determine group position on the ballot paper. However, parties cannot nominate the order candidates appear within groups. Instead, the order candidates appear is randomised, with many different combinations of ballot papers being printed, each with the candidates in each group in a different order. This system is deliberately designed to weaken party control over candidates.\nGroup voting ticket\nUntil the 1983 Senate election, voters had to number every square on the ballot paper to have their vote counted. As at some elections there were more than 50 candidates, marking a ballot paper in this way was an onerous task and informal votes above 10% were not uncommon. To overcome this, a new type of voting was introduced in 1984. Now voters have an option. The ballot paper is divided by a thick line, with boxes to vote for candidates shown ' below the line ', or single boxes for groups or parties marked ' above the line '. Voters can vote in the traditional way, marking a preference for every candidate shown 'below the line', or select a single box 'above the line'. While formally known as 'group ticket voting', this has become more commonly known as 'above the line' voting.\nGroup ticket voting works by each group wishing to use the option lodging a full ticket of preferences to all candidates on the ballot paper. This ticket is lodged within a day or two of the close of nominations. When a voter selects a party using the group ticket voting square, the vote is deemed to have the full list of preferences lodged by that group. A group can lodge one, two or three tickets, with votes divided equally between the tickets. Voters using the group ticket voting square cede their right to distribute preferences to the political party. More than 95% of voters use the group ticket voting square, effectively meaning that the distribution of preferences in the Senate is determined largely by deals between political parties.\nReturn to Top\nHalf Senate Election\nThe terms of State Senators are staggered, half of the Senate facing the election each three years. Senate terms are fixed for six years, half the State Senators facing election every three years. Senate election cannot be held until one year before the end of a term. As governments like to avoid separate half Senate elections, the fixed term of the Senate is a restriction on the timing of House of Representatives elections. After double dissolutions elections, all Senate terms are back-dated to the previous July, and the Senate must resolve who is appointed to six year terms, and who gets shorter three year terms. The constitution does not specify a method for this. Note that Senators for the two Territories have different terms, with no rotation, the two Senators for each territory having their terms tied to that of the House of Representatives, facing the electorate at every House election.\nHare-Clark\nOne type of the two main types of Quota Preferential Voting used in Australia. While there are technical differences between Hare-Clark and the way votes are counted for the Senate, the main differences occur with the presentation of the ballot paper and the weight given to votes for candidates in Hare-Clark. As for the Senate, candidates are grouped on the ballot paper, with the order groups appear determined by ballot. However, in Hare-Clark, there is no group ticket voting . The compulsory filling in of all preferences is also not required. Within groups, the order candidates appear on the ballot paper is randomised, so that each candidate within a group has an equal chance to appear at the head of the group on any given ballot paper. How-to-vote cards are also banned outside polling places. As a result, candidates within a group must compete with each other for votes, and parties are not able to control which of their candidates are elected. Under Hare-Clark, a sitting MP is as often defeated by a candidate from the same party as one one from an opposing party. Hare-Clark gives greater weight to the vote for candidates than the Senate system, which is essentially a system of proportional representation between parties.\nHospital vote\nVoters living in retirement homes or in long term hospital care are generally visited by electoral officials. Some centres are visited ahead of polling day, and residents cast a pre-poll vote. Other mobile booths are taken around large institutions on polling day and voters are able to cast an ordinary vote. In some states, votes collected by mobile booths are are referred to as 'declared institution' or 'electoral visitor' votes.\nHow-to-vote Card\nIn most countries, how-to-vote cards do not exist. Most voters who turn out to vote know who they are going to vote for. Indeed, many countries ban voters from being approached outside polling places. In Australia, compulsory voting means some voters may not yet have made up their mind who to vote for as late as when they enter the polling place. Compulsory preferential voting also makes filling in the ballot paper more complex. For that reason, Australian elections see polling places surrounded by party and candidate workers handing out how-to-vote cards, simple printed examples of how to fill in a formal vote for a candidate. It fulfils three purposes. First, it is a last bit of campaigning to voters who still have not made up their mind who to vote for. Second, it assists voters make sure their vote is formal. Thirdly, it shows voters for a candidate or party how that candidate would like them to direct preferences.At Federal elections, how-to-vote material does not have to be registered, though it must be authorised. There are examples of groups not contesting elections but interested in influencing the result handing out how-to-vote cards. (eg anti-abortion and environmental groups) Some major parties also try to influence how minor party voters distribute their preferences. (eg Labor authorised how to vote cards for the Greens urging preferences to Labor) Some states now force how-to-vote cards to be registered. South Australia is the only state to go down the path of displaying sample how-to-vote cards in polling places. Tasmania and the ACT have effectively banned how-to-vote cards as part of the Hare-Clark electoral system.\nReturn to Top\nIndicative preference count\nA full distribution of preferences is not carried out until all primary votes have been tallied. With up to 10 days allowed for the receipt of postal votes, this can cause some delay for the final determination of the outcome. As the rising vote for minor parties has seen an increase in the number of seats where preferences have to be counted to determine the final result, the Electoral Commission has begun to do indicative preference counts. This count is done in each polling booth between two candidates nominated ahead of the election. The ballot papers for all other candidates are examined to determine which of the two nominated candidates is higher in the preference order. These indicative preference counts are reported on election night and in the week following to assist in determining who has won each seat. In a small number of cases, the wrong two candidates will be nominated for this count, and the final result will have to await a full re-count of the votes.\nInformal vote\nOne of the consequences of compulsory voting, and also the use of complex preferential voting, is that Australia has a high incidence of 'spoiled' ballot papers. In Australia these are known as 'informal' votes, as opposed to 'formal' votes that meet all the formality requirements to be included in the count. At the 2001 election, 4.8% of all ballot papers were deemed to be informal. Of these, 33.6% had been marked with only a first preferences, 19.9% had other forms of defective numbering and 12.4% had incorrectly used ticks and cross. This roughly means two-thirds of informal votes were due to problems caused by the complexity of preferential voting. Of the rest, 21.4% were blank ballot papers, people who you suspect would in other circumstances not have voted, while 6.3% had no vote marked but slogans or derogatory comments were written on the ballot paper. Another 6.5% were informal or other reasons, such as the voter being identified or slogans obscuring the voters preferences. There is a long history in Australia of voters writing derogatory remarks on ballot papers. This is allowed as long as the remarks do not identify the voter or obscure the voting squares.\nReturn to Top\nLanger Voting\nUnder compulsory preferential, a ballot paper must have a complete and sequential ordering of preferences. Even if the primary vote on the ballot paper was for a candidate who finished in the final two-candidate preferred count, the ballot paper was informal if higher preferences were invalid. This was the case even if these higher preferences would never be counted. As a result, the Electoral Act was amended before the 1984 election so that votes with all squares numbered, but where a numbering error occurred, could remain in the count, with preferences valid up until the point where the error occurred. The Parliament did not intend that this to become a form of optional preferential voting, so publicising this form of voting was made illegal. However, a Melbourne political activist, Albert Langer, chose to encourage people to vote deliberately in this way, say to vote 1,2,2,2, etc to deny the major parties preferences. He was eventually ordered by the Electoral Commission to stop encouraging these votes, and when he defied the order, was briefly gaoled. As a result, this form of voting has become known as 'Langer voting'. The provision which allowed duplicate numbering to be formal was removed after the 1998 election, and all Langer-style ballot papers are again informal.\nReturn to Top\nMajority\nWe express the majority as the lead of one party over another. In Parliament, we measure a government's majority against the seats held by all other parties. Going into the 2004 election, the Coalition notionally has 83 of the 150 seats, meaning it has a 16 seat majority over all other parties. Note that only half of this majority is required to be lost before the two sides end up on equal terms. In seats, we tend to talk about the majority of the winning candidate over the defeated candidate in terms of the votes. Again, note that if a candidate had a 2,000 vote majority, it would only take half of these voters to change their mind for the majority to be overturned.\nMalapportionment\nA malapportionment is the use of a system of differential electoral quotas that causes an electoral system to diverge from equal enrolments. In Australia, malapportionments have always seen the creation of lower electoral quotas in rural areas compared to urban areas. As late as the early 1970s, all Australian parliaments contained some degree of rural weighting, something that over the years had come to systematically disadvantage the Labor Party. Over the last three decades, these rural malapportionments have been removed in every state except Western Australia, some form of one-vote one-value electoral boundaries now in use in every state. Note that a malapportionment is not the same as a gerrymander , as electoral enrolments may be heavily weighted without necessarily being unfair. Western Australia retains a rural malapportionment, with a country vote having twice the weight of a Perth vote in the lower house, and three times the weight in the upper house. Queensland retains a small number of electorates that a formula allows to be under quota because of their physical extent.\nMargin\nWe tend to use the term margin to refer to the percentage point lead a candidate or party has on an electorate. So if a candidate won 53.2% of the two-candidate preferred vote at the previous election, we would say they have a 3.2 percentage point margin. That is it would take a 3.2 percentage point swing for the candidate to be defeated. Some people prefer to round this margin up, so in the above case the margin would be 3.3 percentage points, meaning a swing of this size would reduce the candidate's vote below 50%. As a general rule, we tend to talk about the margin in percentage point terms, but the majority in votes.\nReturn to Top\nNomination\nThe process of a candidate nominating to appear on the ballot paper for election. The issue of the writ opens the period in which a candidate may nominate, and the writ specifies the date for close of nominations. A candidate cannot nominate before a writ for election is issued, which is why you cannot ring up your local Electoral Office and find out who the candidate are until after the close of nominations. It is only possible to nominate for a single House or Senate contest. Registered political parties have met the requirement of a minimum number of members supporting their aim, and so have the right to lodge bulk nominations for all electorates under the signature of the parties registered officer. Independent and unaffiliated candidates must be nominated by 50 electors eligible to vote at the election being nominated for. If the candidate is a member of a registered political party, they can request an affiliation be shown on the ballot paper. A candidate must agree to being nominated and pay the relevant deposit. In the Senate, the candidate may also apply to be grouped with other candidates. A nomination can be withdrawn up until the close of nominations. Once all nominations have been verified as valid, a random draw is undertaken to determine order on the ballot paper.\nReturn to Top\nOptional Preferential Voting\nA system that applies at state elections in New South Wales and Queensland, where only a first preference is required for a formal vote to be cast, with all further preferences on the ballot paper entirely optional. The winning candidate no longer has to achieve a majority of the formal vote, merely a majority of the votes remaining in the count after so-called 'exhausted' preferences are excluded. The Hare-Clark electoral system in the Australian Capital Territory is also optional beyond the first preference. In Tasmania, a voter must indicate as many preferences as their are vacancies to be filled (5 currently).\nOrdinary vote\nAll votes cast by electors voting in their own constituency that do not involve the filling of a declaration vote . Voters who turn up to vote at a polling place are asked for their full name, address and whether they have already voted. If they successfully answer these questions and their name is on the roll, they are given two ballot papers, one for the House of Representatives and one for the Senate. Using a pencil to mark the ballot papers while shielded from view by a voting screen, the voter indicates their preferences on both ballot papers, and deposit the completed ballot papers in the appropriate ballot box. After the close of polling, all votes are counted and cross checked with the number of people recorded as voting. Once counted. three results are phoned through from the polling booth to the Returning Officer for each division, the total House primary votes, an indicative preference count for the House, and an initial scrutiny of Senate ballot papers. These results are entered into a computer system in the office of the Returning Officer and made available to the media in the Canberra tally room as well as on the internet. Note that all ordinary votes will be re-counted and checked once they have been delivered to the premises of the Returning Officer for the electorate.\nReturn to Top\nPendulum\nAn electoral pendulum sets out an election as a two-party contest. Seats for Labor or the Coalition are arrayed on two sides of the track along which the pendulum runs, seats ordered from the most marginal at the point of the pendulum, to the safest seats at the top. A uniform swing one way or the other is viewed as a movement of the pendulum. Assuming a swing is uniform, then in theory, every seat up to the new point of the pendulum would change party. This uniform swing does not always occur, though on average, the number of seats that falls tends to match the number that would have fallen given a uniform swing.\nPlebiscite\nBasically, a poll of the electorate's opinion on a subject. In most other countries, the terms plebiscite and referendum are used interchangeably, but in Australia, referendum tends to be reserved for the process by which the Constitution is amended. There have been three Federal plebiscites where all that was required was a majority. In 1916 and 1917, two plebiscites on the introduction of military conscription were defeated. In 1977, a plebiscite was held on changing the national anthem.\nPlurality\nA plurality is a simple majority of votes. A simple majority in an election or vote means the candidate with the highest vote wins. This is as opposed to an absolute majority which is required under Australia's preferential voting system. Winning with a plurality of the votes is a feature of first past the post voting .\nPostal vote\nVoters unable to attend a polling place on election day are entitled to use a postal vote, which is one type of declaration vote . Ballot papers and a declaration vote envelope are posted to the voter. The voter fills in the declaration envelope and then seals the completed ballot papers inside. Before the vote is admitted to the count, the details of the declaration must match those on the electoral roll. An additional check on Postal Votes compared to other forms of declaration vote is that the signature on the envelope must match that on the original application, and that the name of the witness to the signature must also be on the electoral roll.Some voters in remote areas are on a permanent postal vote register and are sent ballot papers as soon as they are available. Other voters apply for postal votes at the start of the campaign. There has been a substantial rise in postal voting at recent elections as the major political parties now flood the electorate with postal vote applications. These applications usually provide a freepost return address for the political party, and the party then passes the application on to the Australian Electoral Commission. The party then very helpfully sends the voters some how-to-vote material for when their postal vote arrives. Electoral Commissioners are not particularly happy with this arrangement as it has increased the number of postal votes at the expense of more secure pre-poll voting. It also introduces double handling by the political party which introduces a delay in processing. Around 570,000 postal votes were issued in 2001 and around 516,000 received. Around 475,00 were admitted to the count, representing 4.0% of the total vote.\nPreferential Voting\nWhen Australian voters fill in their ballot papers, they mark the voting squares with numbers that indicate a rank ordering of the candidates. This is the 'preference' ordering of candidates. Preferential voting is used in both single member electorates, such as for the House of Representatives, and in multi-member electorates, as for the Senate. However, Australians tend to only refer to the single member form of preferential voting when the use the term. The multi-member version tends to be called quota preferential voting , or Hare-Clark or even simply proportional representation . Just to confuse matters further, what Australians call preferential voting usually goes by other names overseas. In its single member form, it is known overseas and in the academic literature as the alternative vote, or AV for short. In the United States, it is also known as instant run-off voting. The multi-member version is known overseas and academically at the single transferable vote, or STV. A variant of optional preferential voting known as the supplementary vote has come into use in the United Kingdom in recent years, where voters are allowed a second preference, though the count of these second preferences only takes place between the two candidates leading on primary votes. In fact, supplementary voting is merely a re-invention of the system used in Queensland between 1892 and 1942 when it was known as contingent voting.\nPre-poll vote\nVoters unable to attend a polling place on election day are entitled to cast a pre-poll vote at early voting centres set up across the country. A Pre-poll vote is one type of declaration vote . The voter is given a pre-poll vote and a declaration envelope. The voter fills in the declaration envelope, then goes to a voting booth to fill in their ballot paper, and returns to the polling clerk to seal the completed ballot papers into the declaration envelope. The envelope will be forwarded to the returning officer for the relevant electorate. Before the vote is admitted to the count, the details of the declaration must match those on the electoral roll. The declaration envelope will not be opened and counted unless these details match. Around 610,000 pre-poll votes were issued in 2001 and around 578,000 admitted to the count, around 4.8% of the total vote.\nPre-selection\nThe process by which a political party chooses a candidate for a seat. This process is controlled entirely by the rules of the political party and does not generally have any oversight by electoral authorities. The term has been borrowed from British politics and had its meaning mangled in the process. In the United Kingdom, pre-selection is a process by which a a party 'pre-selects' a list of possible candidates from which party constituency association choose their candidate. In Australia, this 'pre-selection' phase does not actually take place, and the term simply applies to any process used to choose a candidate.\nPrimary vote\nThe tally of No. 1 preferences recorded by each candidate. If no candidate receives 50% of the total primary vote, then preferences will have to be distributed to determine the winner of the seat.\nProvisional vote\nVoters who attend a polling place on election day but do not have their name on the electoral roll can ask for a provisional vote if they believe their name should be on the roll. A provisional vote is one type of declaration vote , and requires the voter to make a declaration of the address at which they believe they were registered. At the preliminary scrutiny of provisional votes, if the Electoral Commission can find a record of the voter at that address and can show that an administrative error resulted in the voter having been taken off the roll, the voter will be re-instated to the roll and the vote counted. If the voter had been correctly deleted, or there is no record of the voter being registered at the address, the provisional vote will not have its envelope opened. Around 165,000 provisional votes were issued in 2001, though only 81,000 were admitted to the count. This represented about 0.7% of the total vote.\nProportional Representation\nAn electoral system constructed so that the proportion of representatives elected on behalf of a group or party is in proportion of the vote achieved by that group or party. There are many different varieties of proportional representation, most with the aim of creating proportionality based on the primary vote. In Australia, various forms of quota preferential voting are used, where proportionality is distorted by the use of preferential voting. In fact, Australia's systems of proportional representation tend to be semi-proportional, providing fairer representation than single member electorates, but not proportionality based on the proportion of the primary vote.\nProxy vote\nA form of voting where someone can vote on behalf of an elector unable to attend a polling place. Proxy voting is not allowed at any elections in Australia, with plenty of other options available allowing voters to cast votes for themselves with Absent, Postal and Pre-poll votes.\nReturn to Top\nQuota\nThe number of votes required for a candidate to be elected under quota preferential voting . Technically, Australian elections use a 'Droop quota', where the quota is determined by dividing the number of formal votes by one more than the number of members to be elected, the resulting value rounded up. In the case of a half-Senate election, where six Senators are elected, the quota is one-seventh of the vote. At the 2001 election, the quota for election in NSW, the largest state, was 554,207 compared to 44,095 in Tasmania, the smallest state. Candidates elected with more than a quota in their own right have the surplus to quota votes distributed to other candidates as preferences. A candidate's quota at election can consist of primary votes, preferences from excluded candidates and surplus to quota preferences from elected candidates.\nQuota Preferential Voting\nAustralia uses preferential voting in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. In the House it is used in single member electorates. However, in the Senate, it used for multi-member constituencies, as it is in four state upper houses, and the lower house in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. This system of preferential voting in multi-member electorates is best referred to as Proportional Representation by Single Transferable Vote, and overseas is often simply called Single Transferable Vote. In Australia, it has in the past often been called Quota Preferential Voting, as a candidate requires a quota to be elected, and preferences play a part in a candidate achieving a quota. Two main variants are used in Australia, the Senate voting system, and a system used for the Tasmanian and Australian Capital Territory assemblies known as Hare-Clark . While some minor counting differences occur between the two systems, the main differences relate to the way more weight is given to vote for candidates in Hare-Clark compared to party vote in the Senate system.\nReturn to Top\nRe-counts\nRe-counts are quite rare in Australia, as preferential voting means that by the time the count is completed in an electorate, the votes have already been counted several times. Votes are first counted in the polling booth on election night and the results phoned through to the Returning Officer for the division. The counted ballot papers are then transported to the local electoral office by the Deputy Returning Officer appointed for each polling place. All votes from booths are re-counted to ensure that the totals tally with the count on the night. The count is re-done if any discrepancies are discovered. Once all declaration votes have been determined and included in the totals, a distribution of preferences is performed. The closer the electorate, the more heavily it will be scutineered by representatives of the candidates. As a general rule, the small number of votes where there is a dispute over being admitted to the count will be isolated. By the time the counting process has been completed, there is generally little need for a re-count. Close results that go to the Court of Disputed Returns generally do so over irregularities in the conduct of the election, not over problems with the conduct of the count.\nRedistribution\nA periodic re-drawing of electoral boundaries. Boundaries may be re-drawn when a state becomes entitled to a change in seat numbers according to the constitution. Alternatively, every seven years, electorates are re-drawn to bring seats back within average. This process is often known overseas as as redistricting or re-apportionment. Over the last three decades, all states and the Commonwealth have moved to using independent Commissions appointed to draw the electoral boundaries. While these composition of these commissions varies from state to state, they generally involved representation by a judge or retired judge, the Electoral Commissioner, the Surveyor-General or the Auditor-General.\nReferendum\nOverseas, the terms referendum and plebiscite are used interchangeably. In Australia, referendum is reserved for the constitutional amendment process defined in Section 128 of the Commonwealth Constitution. A referendum must receive a double majority, recording a majority of the national vote as well as a majority in a majority of the states. As there are six states, this means a majority in four of the six states. Several attempts to change the constitution have recorded a majority across the country but failed on the majority of states test. Some clauses concerning the representation rights of the original states must be passed by all states.\nRemote Mobiles\nIn remote electorates, some votes are collected by mobile polling teams. In particular, these teams service indigenous communities in areas where an irregular postal service makes postal voting impractical. Polling is conducted in the two weeks prior to polling day. While classed as ordinary vote, remote mobiles are not counted on the night at Federal elections.\nRun-off Elections\nRun-off elections are used in countries like France and Indonesia to elect the President. A first round of voting is held, and if no candidate achieves 50% of the vote, a second run-off election is held between the two leading candidates. Some US states use use� run-off elections, and to save costs, some are examining preferential voting as a form of instant run-off elections. Run-off elections were used for New South Wales elections between 1910 and 1916, but abandoned in favour of preferential voting . Note that under preferential voting, unlike in run-off elections, a candidate can win an election from third place.\nScrutineer\nScrutineers are nominated by candidates to observe the conduct of polling in polling places, to observe the conduct of the count, and to observe the processing and counting of declaration votes . Candidates cannot scrutineer for themselves. At no time must any scrutineer attempt to encourage an elector to vote in a particular way within a polling place or to touch a ballot paper during the count. In recent years, the main roll of party scrutineers on election night has been to try and assess the flow of minor party preferences, but even this function has been superseded by the conduct of indicative preference counts on election night. These days, parties rarely bother to scrutineer the conduct of polling, and put only a limited effort into scrutineering on election night. Most scrutineering is now concentrated on the small number of electorates in doubt at the end of election night. These seats will see the parties send there most experienced scrutineers along to the check counts and the scrutiny of declaration votes . In safe seats, the Electoral Commission is often left to conduct the count with only minimal interference from scrutineers. While electoral officials will often grumble about rude scrutineers (and scrutineers about officious electoral officials), scrutineers play an important roll in ensuring that electoral officials conduct the count correctly.\nReturn to Top\nSilent Roll\nAny voter who believes either their security or their family's security would be put at risk by their address appearing on the publicly accessible electoral roll, may apply for a silent enrolment. A silent voter will have their name listed on the roll but no address. On turning up at a polling place, a silent voter will be given a provisional vote, as the voter cannot confirm their place of address. A silent vote will only be admitted if the voters enrolment can be confirmed when provisional votes are given preliminary scrutiny.\nSupplementary Election\nAny general election poll which is delayed until a later date. For instance, in Dickson in 1993 and Newcastle in 1998, the election was deferred for a month  following the death of a candidate. While new nominations are called for, the roll used at a supplementary election is the same as the original roll from the general election. Note that Senate elections are not deferred by the death of a candidate. Rather, the deceased candidate is excluded as a first phase of the count, and then the normal Senate count proceeds. A supplementary election is not a by-election . Elections that are voided by the courts and re-contested are sometimes called re-elections but fall under the general category of by-elections .\nSwing - primary\nThe percentage of primary vote recorded by a party or candidate at an election, minus the percentage of vote received at the previous election. If this value is positive, it is a swing to the candidate. If it is negative, it is a swing away from the candidate. The swing is measured in percentage points, though the symbol '%' is often incorrectly appended to the value.\nSwing . two-party\nThe percentage of two-party preferred vote recorded by a party or candidate at an election, minus the percentage received at the previous election. If this value is positive, it is a swing to the candidate or party. If it is negative, it is a swing away from the candidate. The swing is measured in percentage points, though the symbol '%' is often incorrectly appended to the value. When historical two-party preferred votes for Labor and the Coalition are compared over several elections, it is a common convention for swings to Labor to be shown with a plus sign, swings to the Coalition to be shown with a minus sign. The meaning of the signs should always checked when reading tables.\nReturn to Top\nTally room\nIn Australia, the Australian Electoral Commission and its predecessors (and equivalent state bodies) have always taken responsibility for collating results on election day. This arrangement is quite different from many other countries, where local authorities conduct elections and the media collates results to determine national trends. Results are made available to the media and political parties at a central tally room. Note that votes are not actually counted at this centre, merely reported. At Federal elections, the tally room is held at the National Exhibition Centre in Canberra. The tally room is in reality little more than a large shed in which the television networks set up their live broadcast sets. No political leader has attended the tally room since Bob Hawke's dramatic entry after winning the 1983 election. In fact, the only politicians present in the tally room are those the media arrange to be interviewed. In recent years, the need for the tally room has been superseded by the ability to the Electoral Commission to publish results on the Internet. Despite this, the television networks still go to the tally room, and the Electoral Commission continue to use an old fashioned wooden tally board on which results are updated by hand-posting numbers. The public are allowed into the Federal tally room and the tally rooms at some state elections. The result of all this is that Australian election broadcasts have the buzz and atmosphere of a live broadcast, unlike election broadcasts in many other countries, where the program is produced in the sterile confines of a television studio.\nThree Cornered Contest\nMost Australian electorates come down to two-party contests between candidates representing the Labor Party and the Liberal National Party Coalition . However, the Coalition agreement between the two parties allows both parties to contest seats where there is not a sitting Coalition MP. These contests between Labor, Liberal and National Party candidates are termed three cornered contests. The impetus for abandoning first past the post voting in 1918 was the formation of the Country Party, preferential voting allowing multiple conservative candidates to compete against each other without delivering victory to the Labor Party.\nTurnout\nThe total number of votes cast, including both formal and informal ballot papers, expressed as a percentage of voters on the electoral roll. As a result of compulsory voting, the normal turnout for Australian elections is around 95%.\nTwo-Candidate Preferred\nOnce all primary votes have been finalised in the count for an electorate, the candidate with the lowest total is excluded from the count and their ballot papers examined to determine the next valid preference for a candidate continuing in the count. This process is repeated until only two candidates remain in the count. At this stage, primary votes from all other candidates have been distributed to their preferred candidate of the two remaining in the count. These final totals are referred to as the two-candidate preferred count or totals. Where these two-candidate represent the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Party Coalition, this vote is also referred to as the two-party preferred count. In most seats, the two-candidate and the two-party preferred totals are the same. In a seat where an Independent or minor party candidate finishes first or second, the two-party preferred must be determined by a separate count. Note that only the two-candidate preferred count is the actual result for an electorate. It is common to reduce election contests to a two-party contests between Labor and the Coalition, but in seats that were not two-party contests, such a count is a bookkeeping device. A distribution of preferences is only required in electorates where no candidate achieves 50% of the vote. However, the Australian Electoral Commission conducts a full distribution of preferences in every electorate for information purposes.\nTwo-Party Preferred\nIn most seats, the two-party preferred result for an electorate will be the same as the two-candidate preferred result. Australian elections are mainly conducted between the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Party Coalition. In most seats, the final two-candidates after preferences will represent Labor and the Coalition. This was the case in 145 of the 150 electorates in 2001. In the five seats which were not two-party contests, the Electoral Commission conducted a secondary two-party distribution. Two-party preferred counts allow all electorates to be ranked on the scale from very safe Labor to very safe Coalition, and for nationwide two-party totals to be accumulated. Two-party preferred counts are the basis of the familiar electoral pendulum . However, the party that wins the majority of the national two-party preferred vote will not necessarily win the majority of seats, as was shown when the Howard government was re-elected in 1998 with 49.0% of the two-party preferred vote.\nReturn to Top\nUngrouped candidates\nOn Senate ballot papers, two or more candidates may apply to appear on the ballot paper as a group, giving them their own column on the ballot paper, and if they choose to lodge a group preference ticket, access to a group voting square or above-the-line vote. Sitting Senators also have the right to their own group if they nominate on their own. All other candidates who are not part of a group will be lumped together in an 'Ungrouped' column on the right-hand side of the ballot paper. Ungrouped candidates do not have the right to lodge a group ticket vote. At state election in South Australia and Western Australia, individual candidates do get access to their own column and a group voting square.\nUniform Swing\nUniform swing is an assumption we make that a national two-party swing at an election will tend to cause a given number of seats to change party. It is an underlying assumption in the use of electoral pendulums to illustrate the relative margins of� seats. At the 2004 election, we say a uniform 1.5% swing against the Howard government would see it lose eight seats and its majority in parliament. In fact, the swing is never the same in every seat. In 1998, the Labor Party achieved the 5% swing it needed to win government, but that swing did not occur in some of the key marginal seats, allowing the Howard government to be returned to office. At some elections, there are often different swings from state to state, or from region to region, which mean the result for a given national swing is not reflected in the number of seats changing hands.\nReturn to Top\nWrit\nA writ is a legal document which commands an electoral official to conduct an election and which specifies the dates for the close of rolls, the close of nominations, the polling and the return of the writ.\n\n"
