Some portion of its coast was undoubtedly one of the first parts of the continent seen by Europeans. Its total area is 405, 720 km2, of which Labrador makes up almost three-quarters (294,330 km2).\nNewfoundland, the youngest of the Canadian provinces, joined Confederation in 1949. Some portion of its coast was undoubtedly one of the first parts of the continent seen by Europeans. Its total area is 405, 720 km2, of which Labrador makes up almost three-quarters (294,330 km2). The island of Newfoundland is the easternmost region of Canada, while Labrador is located on the mainland to the northwest. Since John Cabot 's arrival on the “new isle” the island has been referred to as Terra Nova, or in English, Newfoundland. Labrador probably received its name from the Portuguese designation, \"Terra del Lavradors.\"\nLand and Resources\nThe province is physically divided into two major units of unequal area: the much larger mainland territory of Labrador to the north; and the smaller island of Newfoundland to the south. Within each there are distinct variations in the physical characteristics of the environment, in the occurrence and availability of natural resources, and  corresponding variations in the pattern of human settlement.\nIn Labrador there are three such sub-regions: a northern coastal region, which is ruggedly mountainous, deeply fjorded , grows only ground-level subarctic vegetation and has very little settlement; a southern coastal region that has a rugged, barren foreshore and a forested hinterland, with light to moderate settlement; and the bulk of the vast interior, which comprises a well-forested, dissected plateau, and where settlement is concentrated in a few large towns.\nOn the island of Newfoundland there are four distinct regions: the west coast, the interior, the northeast coast and the south coast. The west coast is dominated by the table-topped Long Range Mountains , which rise to 814 m. They are bordered in places by narrow, well-forested coastal plains and are frequently penetrated by glacially-deepened valleys and by several large fjord-like bays, the largest of which are the Bay of Islands and Bonne Bay.\nThere is almost continuous settlement in the bays and coves along the west coast. There is also some interior settlement in the Codroy Valley to the south and around Deer Lake , which lies on a small plain within the mountain range. The interior is a plateau-like region with frequent undulations in the terrain representing the ridges and slopes of the watersheds carved out by the major stream systems. Four large rivers — Exploits , Gander , Humber and Terra Nova — drain most of the area.\nThe west coast supports extensive forest stands, particularly on the gentle slopes of the major watersheds. Settlements are widely separated and most of the population is concentrated in a few large towns associated with forest or mineral resource use and with transportation services.\nThe northeast coast, with its numerous bays, islands and headlands, fronts on the Atlantic Ocean from the Great Northern Peninsula to the Avalon Peninsula . Inland sections of this region are generally well forested, but exposed headlands and offshore islands have low, scrubby vegetation. The region has a shoreline typical of land that was submerged by glaciation and, in places, rebounded after the ice caps melted. Thus, there are innumerable bays, coves, islands and fjords which often provide excellent harbours. It is also an area that can annually expect to be blocked by arctic drift ice throughout the winter and early spring. Settlement has developed along the shores of most of the bays and on some offshore islands.\nThe south coast region coincides with the whole southern portion of the Island of Newfoundland. This coast also has the deeply embayed characteristics of a submerged shoreline. It is not blocked by arctic drift ice, although in some years parts of the eastern Avalon Peninsula as far south as St John's may be cut off for a few days.\nThe inland areas of the island are generally hilly and rugged while shallow bogs and heath vegetation covers much of the land. The variation in climate and in the nature of the terrain dictates a similar variation in the nature of vegetation and growth rates. Generally the well-drained lowlands have the best forest growth, and there are sufficient timber stands to constitute an important resource.\nGeology\nLabrador occupies the easternmost section of the Canadian Shield and comprises mostly tough, ancient Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks. There are some areas of softer sedimentary rocks, notably in the west in a formation called the Labrador Trough. This area contains some of the most extensive iron ore deposits in North America. The interior region is plateau-like, on average about 450 m above sea level and greatly dissected by large, east-flowing rivers, such as the Churchill River and its tributaries. These rivers cut through the eastern rim of the saucer-shaped shield to discharge into the Labrador Sea . This rim is largely mountainous, especially in the north, where the Torngat Mountains rise to over 1,500 m. Of these, the highest is Mount Caubvick at 1,652 m.\nIn 1993, a large nickel , copper and cobalt discovery was made at Voisey Bay (approximately 35 km southwest of Nain ). It is considered the richest base metal discovery since the Second World War .\nThe Island of Newfoundland is part of the Appalachian system and displays the typical southwest to northeast alignment in its major bays, peninsulas, river systems and mountain ranges. Rocks are more varied on the Island than in Labrador. Continental drifting, followed by frequent periods of crustal deformation, interspersed by long periods of erosion and deposition, have combined to produce this great variety in types and ages.\nThe oldest rocks are Precambrian and occur in the east, in and around the Avalon and Burin peninsulas; they are mostly folded sedimentary rocks, but in a few areas later intrusions have solidified into volcanic rocks. Small remnants of gently sloping Cambrian and Ordovician sedimentary rocks occur in pockets along the coast. The most significant are in Conception Bay , where the Ordovician rocks that form Bell Island contain layers of hematite iron ore with estimated reserves of billions of tonnes.\nThe central and western portions of the Island are underlaid by a great variety of Palaeozoic rocks of sedimentary , igneous and metamorphic origin, within which crustal deformation has been generally severe. Long periods of erosion following periods of uplift have left a poly-cyclical landscape with the remnants of old erosion surfaces displayed in the plateau-like interior and on the flat-topped mountains of the Long Range. A mineralized belt in these Palaeozoic rocks, stretching from an area on the south coast just east of Channel-Port Aux Basques to the general area of western Notre Dame Bay on the northeast coast, contain ores composed of copper , lead , zinc , gold and silver .\nThe youngest and least-disturbed rocks of this Palaeozoic series lie in and around the coastal plain on the west coast. These are Mississippian and Pennsylvanian, containing much gypsum, which is quarried, and limestone . There are a few coal deposits and signs of petroleum, but nothing of commercial value has been discovered. Off Newfoundland’s coast, extensive deposits of Cretaceous rock  stretch the length of the Grand Banks.\nSurface\nAll areas of the province show the effects of continental glaciation during the Pleistocene era, the final stages of which are dated to 7,000 years ago. Moving ice sheets scoured and sculpted the province’s surface. Most of the unconsolidated parent material beneath present-day soils consists of glacial debris or marine sediments.\nThe interior regions of both Labrador and the Island are strewn with lakes and covered with moraines , and give evidence of an immense ice cap, which initially moved radially outward from a centre west of Labrador, but in the later periods of the Pleistocene period broke down into smaller, separate ice caps with centres in Labrador, the west-central Island and the Avalon Peninsula.\nMost coastal regions are fjorded where the ice channelled down the valleys of the pre-glacial fluvial system. The longest and most steep-sided fjords occur in northern Labrador and around the Great Northern Peninsula of the Island, but there are several places where this scouring effect from ice movement is absent. Most bays have been deepened and are often fjord-like in character. Many places in the north of the Island and in Labrador show, because of postglacial uplift, raised shorelines and large stretches of marine sediments.\nThe most striking and extensive marine deposits are those in the remnants of raised deltas that occur around St George's Bay and around Happy Valley-Goose Bay in Labrador at the mouth of the Churchill River . Coastal features, such as offshore islands, spits, tombolos and bay-mouth bars (barachoix), which are typical of a submerged shoreline, are common throughout the south and southeast coastal regions.\nIn northern Labrador, and in high places throughout the province, soils are generally coarse and immature. Due to cool temperatures and exposure to hard environmental conditions, vegetation is either entirely lacking or is only of the subarctic, lichen , tundra or ground-level variety.\nDue to deep surface deposits, there are excellent forest stands in the interior regions, such as on the watersheds of the Churchill, Exploits, Humber and Gander rivers. Extensive bogland has developed in the many hollows of this glaciated landscape. The forest is made up of several of the species common to the boreal forest that stretches across northern North America.\nBalsam fir predominates as the most common tree in Newfoundland and the second most common in Labrador. Black spruce and balsam fir are dominant in close forests, but the ratio is dependent upon site type. Balsam fir, for example, regenerates more successfully in places that have been clear cut. Nevertheless, black spruce grows particularly well, especially in open stands and where forest has regenerated after fire, and approximately one third of Newfoundland’s forests and two thirds of Labrador’s forests are black spruce. Subdominants are represented by larch, pine and typical boreal deciduous species such as paper birch , aspen , alder , pin cherry and mountain ash .\nMany of the non-forested areas support ground-level, mossy plants, some of which are food for wildlife, while others, such as the blueberry, partridge berry and bakeapple (\"cloudberry\"), can be gathered for human consumption.\nWater\nThrough scouring and deposits, glaciation left a pockmarked landscape capable of storing vast quantities of water in thousands of lakes, ponds and bogs. Many of the ponds are shallow, but many of the lakes are in large, old valleys deepened by glacial scouring and dammed by glacial deposits. In interior Labrador hundreds of lakes have been combined by means of canals, dikes and dams, to create the 6,527 km2 Smallwood Reservoir (roughly one-third the size of Lake Ontario ) behind the huge hydro development of Churchill Falls .\nBecause of the moist climate and plentiful snowfall, the water table is high in all areas, lakes are usually full and rivers flow perennially. There is naturally some seasonal fluctuation and occasionally very wet or dry years, but water shortages for domestic or industrial use are rare.\nClimate\nClimate varies considerably throughout the province. Interior Labrador has a continental climate, but the southeastern areas around the Burin and Avalon peninsulas are marine. The transitional variation makes it difficult to designate specific climatic regions, but certain generalizations can be made.\nThe climate of northern Labrador is truly subarctic in that there is generally coolness and dryness throughout the year. In Nain, average mean maximum temperatures are approximately -13°C in January and 15°C in July. The mean minimum temperature drops to approximately -20°C in January and 5°C in July. The winters of interior Labrador are also extremely cold.\nPrecipitation varies by region even within northern Labrador. For example, Nain’s average annual precipitation is 892.7 mm, approximately half of which is from snow. However, Cape Chidley’s annual precipitation is approximately 460 mm. In coastal areas the modifying influence of the ocean reduces the temperature range between summer and winter. In southern Labrador coastal regions are cold in winter and cool in summer, and interior regions are often severely cold in winter but warm in summer.\nOn the Island there is a similar though not so marked difference between coastal and inland regions. In St John’s, mean maximum temperatures are approximately -1°C in January and 20°C in July. The mean minimum temperature drops to approximately -8°C in January and 11°C in July.\nPrecipitation across the island varies in a northwest to southeast direction. Precipitation is fairly even every month, but in northern locations about half falls as snow and in the milder southeast, snowfall is only about 12 per cent. Average annual precipitation around the Avalon and Burin peninsulas is over 150 cm.\nThe mixing of the air masses off the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream frequently creates fog on the Grand Banks, and in eastern and southern coastal areas, particularly in spring and early summer. Wildlife [H3]\nSince most of the interior of the province is relatively uninhabited, there is ample space and a suitable habitat for wildlife, some species of which constitute an important resource. There is a greater variety in Labrador than on the Island. Among large game are several species of caribou , moose , black bear and, in northern coastal areas, polar bear . There are many small, fur-bearing animals, the most important of which are beaver , fox , lynx , rabbit , otter and muskrat . Some are trapped for the value of their pelts or for food while others are hunted annually by licensed sportsmen.\nConservation\nIn many coastal areas colonies of millions of seabirds nest annually, primarily gulls , gannets , murres , kittiwakes and puffins . Sanctuaries to protect these birds have been established in six provincial ecological reserves (e.g., the Gannet Islands off the Labrador coast, on Funk Island on the east coast of the Avalon Peninsula and at Cape St Mary’s on the south coast). Three migratory bird sanctuaries are on the Grey Islands and in Terra Nova National Park .\nGros Morne National Park preserves a spectacular natural region on the west coast and Terra Nova National Park on the east coast. There are also 32 provincial parks, 11 other ecological reserves.\nPeople\nUrban Centres\nSettlement by Europeans was slow and reflected the dominance of the fisheries. Early settlers paid little attention to the soil or lack of amenities, settling on the shoreline in bays and coves close to the inshore and offshore fishing grounds, primarily on the east coast. Settlement gradually spread and became permanent. The first centres developed around St John’s and Conception Bay, then generally along the east and south coasts. Today, St John’s is the capital of the province and the largest city, followed by Corner Brook , Grand Falls-Windsor and Bay Roberts . In 2011, 59 per cent of the population was urban, which follows larger national trends of increasing urbanization.\nLabour Force\nIn the years leading up to the collapse of the Atlantic fishery in the 1990s, five to six per cent of the labour force was employed by the fishing, hunting and trapping industries. Since then, however, employment in these industries has experienced a rapid decline, decreasing 52 per cent from 9,400 in 2002 to 4,500 in 2012, or just under two per cent of the labour force. During the same time frame, employment in mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction increased 96 per cent, from 5,700 in 2002 to 11,200 in 2012.\nDespite the importance of resource-based industries to the province, the service sector still employs the most people — 74 per cent in 2012. Within this broad category health care and social assistance, retail trades and public administration were the top three employers in 2012.\nThe unemployment rate in Newfoundland and Labrador has often been the highest rate in Canada since 1977, and has been consistently higher than the national average, in many years double the national average. In 2012 it was 12.5 per cent, compared to a national average of 7.2 per cent.\nLanguage and Ethnicity\nThere are several Aboriginal communities in the province, including the Mi’kmaq on the Island and the Innu , Inuit and Inuit-Métis in Labrador.\nElsewhere the population is of predominantly European origin, the majority descended from immigrants from southwestern England and southern Ireland. On the west coast of the Island there are pockets of people of French descent (mostly Acadian ) and some Scots whose ancestors were from Cape Breton , NS.\nReligion\nReligious affiliation closely follows ethnic origin as the majority of residents are Christian, identifying as either Catholic or Protestant.\nHistory\nAboriginal Settlement\nDuring the prehistoric period, a group of people referred to by archaeologists as the Maritime Archaic lived in the area now known as Newfoundland and Labrador from about 8000 to 3200 BCE. They were followed by the Palaeo-eskimo, who lived in the region from about 2800 to 600 BCE, and then the Recent Indians, present from about 2000 BCE to the historic period. On the Island, the Recent Indians were the ancestors of the Beothuk , and in Labrador, the Innu. The ancestors of the Labrador Inuit were the Thule .\nWhen John Cabot arrived in 1497, the Beothuk inhabited all parts of the island. While they did have some contact with the Europeans, they generally tried to avoid them, retreating inland. Without access to the coast, their food sources were limited, and they also began to suffer from European diseases, particularly tuberculosis. The best known Beothuk were two women, Mary March ( Desmasduwit ) and Shawnadithit , who were captured in 1819 and brought to St John's. They, like the remainder of their community, soon died.\nFollowing Cabot’s arrival the Mi’kmaq, originally of the region now known as Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island , the Gaspé Peninsula and New Brunswick , began to travel the Gulf of St Lawrence in order to trade fur for European goods. Eventually some settled in Newfoundland. Today there is a Mi’kmaq community at Conne River.\nLike the Beothuk, the Innu and Inuit of Labrador also suffered upon the arrival of the Europeans. Among other challenges, they died from foreign disease, and their land base was encroached upon. However, there remain two Innu communities in Labrador today, Sheshatshiu and Natuashish. In 2004, the Inuit won the right to self-government. Called the Nunatsiavut Government, the settlement area is in Northern Labrador and includes five Inuit communities: the Nain, Hopedale, Rigolet, Makkovik and Postville.\nExploration\nAt the end of the 10th century, Norse , including Leif Ericsson , made several voyages of exploration from Greenland to overseas lands to the west and southwest, and established a temporary settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows on the Great Northern Peninsula of the Island. In 1497 John Cabot , a Venetian navigator, sailed on a voyage of discovery for Henry VII of England and discovered new lands, which are believed to have been between Nova Scotia and Labrador, and included a \"new isle.\" In 1500 the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real made a more thorough exploration, and named several bays and capes along the east coast of the Island. In 1535–36 Jacques Cartier demonstrated that Newfoundland was an island by sailing through Cabot Strait as well as the Strait of Belle Isle. In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed into St John's Harbour and claimed the Island for England.\nEuropeans had been exploiting the rich cod stocks off the coast of Newfoundland since shortly after John Cabot's voyage. During the 16th century this was a migratory fishery with crews from ports in France, Spain, Portugal and England sailing each spring and returning in the fall with salt cod. Starting in the 1540s, Basques from France and Spain also carried on whaling operations on the south coast of Labrador. Although England was involved in some of the earliest voyages to Newfoundland, its role in the migratory fishery was small before the 1570s. However, war in Europe crippled the other nations' fisheries and opened up markets for English salt cod. By 1600 the English fishery had grown to include approximately 150 ships sailing mostly from West Country ports, and the coast from Trepassey to Bonavista had come to be known as the English Shore.\nEuropean Settlement\nRelative peace in Western Europe in the early 17th century resulted in various attempts to settle the east coast of North America. Although it was well known for its fishery in many western European ports, the English were reluctant to use Newfoundland as anything more than a fishing colony. To this end women were initially prohibited from venturing to the island, as it was thought that their presence would increase the likelihood of permanent settlement. Keeping Newfoundland’s population flexible and transitory was in the best interest of the British Crown and its merchants as it could be used as a training ground for its naval officers, they owed little responsibility to those who visited the island and migratory fishing had already proven profitable. Nevertheless, women were eventually allowed to settle on the island once it became apparent that having small settlements could prove even more advantageous for the fishing industry. The first colony was founded by the London and Bristol Company at Cupers Cove (now Cupids ) in Conception Bay in 1610, and in 1611, 40 men and 16 women arrived to start the settlement. By 1618 some of the Bristol merchants had established a second colony, called Bristol's Hope, at Harbour Grace . In 1621, George Calvert began a settlement at Ferryland , and Carbonear was settled by at least 1627. Over the next 50 years settlement gradually expanded and by 1675, there were 1,655 people living in 31 small fishing villages on the English Shore.\nThe tradition of appointing the master of the first fishing vessel to arrive in a harbour each spring the \"admiral\" of that place dates back to the 16th century. However, despite popular belief, it seems that these \" fishing admirals \" usually restricted their activities to various fishery related matters. In the first half of the 17th century, the various proprietary governors, such as John Guy at Cupids and David Kirke at Ferryland, were responsible for maintaining order among the colonists; and during England's Interregnum (England was without a monarchy from 1649–60), Parliament appointed a commissioner, John Treworgie, to oversee the Island's affairs. However, despite various petitions from some of the more prominent settlers, little attention was paid to the Island's governance between 1660 and 1697.\nCertain elements in the West Country fishery objected to year-round settlement and some legislation was passed in an effort restrict it. In 1675 those opposed to settlement persuaded the English government to order all the settlers to leave. However, John Berry, the naval commander sent out to enact this policy, soon realized that any such attempt was futile and became a staunch defender of settlement, arguing that the planters were both an asset to the migratory fishery and a defense against the French. Two years later the English Privy Council recognized the settlers' right to remain in Newfoundland.\nIn 1662, the first French colony was established in Newfoundland at Placentia . Over the next 20 years, a number of other settlements grew up, and by 1687 there were more than 600 French settlers in Newfoundland and on the nearby island of Saint-Pierre . War between England and France broke out in 1689 and continued with only a short respite until 1713. It was during these conflicts, known to the English as King William's War and Queen Anne's War, that the issue of who would control Newfoundland was finally decided.\nThe French launched two devastating campaigns. In the winter of 1696–97 when a French force and some native allies, led by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville , destroyed almost all the English settlements. However, the French failed to consolidate their victory; and by the summer of 1697, the settlements were re-occupied and a British garrison had been established at St John's. In the winter and spring of 1705 another French force, led by Jacques Testard de Montigny, destroyed many of the English settlements but it too was a short-lived victory and the English soon returned. Despite the devastation of the French attacks, the Treaty of Utrecht , signed in 1713, awarded Newfoundland to England and left the French with fishing rights to the French Shore , a section of the coast between Cape Bonavista and Point Riche. In 1762, at the end of the Seven Years’ War , the French captured St John's briefly and used it as a base to attack other settlements, but the British soon drove them off.\nKing William's Act, issued in 1699, recognized the rights of settlers but made no allowance for a settled government. Instead it confirmed the position of the fishing admirals and gave the commanders of the Royal Naval ships that accompanied the English fishing fleet the right to act as appeal judges. Over the course of the 18th century the Royal Navy was to become the dominant judicial and political force in Newfoundland.\nIn 1729 Newfoundland's first naval governor, Captain Henry Osborne, was appointed. The naval governors sailed to Newfoundland each spring and returned to England in the fall. To maintain order during the rest of the year, Osborne divided the Island into six judicial districts, and justices of the peace and constables were appointed from among the local population. Twenty-one years later, the first court of oyer and terminer (hear and determine) was held at St John's with a jury made up of local residents. By 1776 a customs house was built at St John's to regulate trade and suppress smuggling, and in 1792 a Supreme Court of Judicature was established.\nThe removal of the French in 1713 led to an expansion of English settlement beyond the original English Shore. Along the south coast, settlement spread into St Mary’s , Placentia and Fortune bays. Settlement also expanded northwest onto the French Shore. Fogo Island and Twillingate , both in Notre Dame Bay, were settled in 1728 and 1732 respectively.\nThere were a few Irish settlers among the first colonists in Newfoundland but the majority was English. More Irish arrived in the latter part of the 17th century. These were mostly female servants, many of whom married local servants and planters. Some of the Irishmen among the soldiers stationed in St John's in 1697 also settled on the Island. By the 1720s Irish servants were arriving in Newfoundland in considerable numbers. This mixture of West Country English and Irish cultures has continues to shape the identity of the Island's peoples.\nBy 1775 the population of Newfoundland had risen to nearly 12,000. Although the cod fishery remained the main industry, increased population led to a more diversified economy: logging, shipbuilding , trapping, salmon fishing and sealing all came to play a more important role, and the demand for a variety of skilled tradesmen increased. This period also saw the beginning of a seasonal fishery between Newfoundland and Labrador, and merchants establishing premises on the Labrador coast to collect furs and exploit the cod, salmon and seal fisheries.\nThe French Revolution (1789–99) and Napoleonic Wars (1799–1815) saw dramatic change in Newfoundland. The English migratory fishery ground to a halt and never fully recovered as the dangers of a trans-Atlantic crossing increased; and many West Country fishermen were pressed into the British Navy. Increased danger at sea also meant that many more people chose to remain on the Island, thus spurring population growth. The defeat of the French in Spain in 1811 reopened the markets in southern Europe for Newfoundland salt cod and initiated an economic boom that saw many new arrivals, especially from Ireland. By the time peace arrived in 1815, the Newfoundland population had risen to more than 40,000 and the fishery was firmly in the hands of the resident population.\nDevelopment\nOnce a significant permanent population was established, petitions for better government and local representation increased. Dr. William Carson and Patrick Morris , through a campaign of pamphlets and petitions to Britain, succeeded in having representative government established in 1832, with the objective to obtain responsible government and full colonial status, which was finally achieved in 1855.\nSettlement increased throughout the 19th century. The salt-cod fishery was the principal occupation and the mainstay of the economy, but there was also logging, mining and agriculture. In the late 1800s the trans-insular railway began to open up the interior, and goods and services became accessible to many parts formerly isolated in winter.\nRepresentatives of the various Newfoundland governments attended the Confederation conferences, but they chose not to join, despite substantial support of the movement. When the French fishing rights were revoked in 1904, the northern and western coasts became available for settlement.\nUntil about 1925 the economy was based on the primary industries — fishing, mining, and pulp and paper — but debts incurred through building railways and supporting a regiment in First World War , coupled with the Great Depression after 1929, produced bankruptcy and government collapse. Newfoundland was forced to beg Britain for assistance and eventually reassumed colonial status under a Commission of Government .\nThe economy recovered remarkably towards the end of the 1930s, mainly because of increasing demand for products from the sea, mines and forests, and because of increased activity in defence-based construction in anticipation of Second World War. During the war many young people joined the armed forces overseas, and at home there was full employment. The US, Canada and Britain established several army bases, two large naval bases and five airports in Newfoundland. Gander was the largest and most important airport because of its role in the transatlantic Ferry Command. When the Commission government was dissolved in 1949, it had cleared all debts and left a surplus of over $40 million.\nAfter the Second World War, a national convention was elected to debate the question of Newfoundland's future and to make recommendations. It was decided to hold a referendum through which the people would make a choice between the Commission government, confederation with Canada, or a return to responsible government and Dominion status. The referendum proved inconclusive except that Newfoundlanders were unwilling to retain the Commission government. A second referendum with the options of Confederation or Dominion was then held. An intensive campaign ensued between the confederates, led by Joseph R. Smallwood , and the anti-confederates, which the confederates won by a narrow margin, 52 per cent to 48 per cent. Canada accepted Newfoundland at midnight on 31 March 1949, and Smallwood became premier of the first provincial government.\nThe next two decades witnessed dramatic and substantial changes in the economy and in the lifestyle of Newfoundlanders. The fishing industry was revolutionized as dozens of fresh-fish-processing plants were established on all coasts and as they gradually all but replaced the old method of the family-run enterprise of catching, salting and sun-curing cod for sale to Caribbean and Mediterranean areas. Draggers operating offshore on the Banks, and smaller boats in the near-shore and inshore waters, could now catch a variety of species for delivery to the plants, where the fish were quick-frozen for new markets, chiefly in the US. The number of fishermen declined greatly and opportunity for shore work in the plants increased.\nThe pulp and paper mills at Corner Brook and Grand Falls substantially increased production, and mines at Buchans, St Lawrence and Wabana worked to capacity. New industries were launched with government-backing and although most failed — including a steel mill, a rubber-goods plant, a leather-products plant and a knitting mill — a few succeeded, notably the plasterboard and cement plant at Corner Brook, the particle-board mill near St John's and the phosphorus plant at Long Harbour, Placentia Bay. A huge oil refinery at Come by Chance at first failed (1973–76) but has been producing oil since 1987, mainly for export to the United States.\nThe huge iron ore mines of western Labrador came into production in the 1950s. Since the Second World War many people have moved from small communities to large towns and growth centres. As chances for local employment diminished, young people left the province at an annual rate of about 5,000. With opportunities accessible through cheap transportation by land, air and sea, they moved on, mostly to central or western Canada.\nThe impact of the economic recessions of the late 1970s, early 1980s and early 1990s were sharply felt in Newfoundland, although there was no comparison with the desperate conditions of the Great Depression in the early 1930s. Unemployment insurance, old-age pensions, social assistance and other benefits of the welfare state ensured decent living and health standards.\nHigh unemployment most severely affected the young and there was again considerable out-migration in the late 1990s and early 2000s as people sought employment in western Canada's booming economy. The development of the Voisey's Bay nickel mine in northern Labrador and offshore oil production since 1997 have reversed the long-term trend of annual deficit budgets for the province. Increased economic activity, especially in the St John's metropolitan region, has contributed to the province experiencing in-migration.\nEconomy\nThe province is generously endowed with natural resources, and periodic development of each resource has proved beneficial to both primary and secondary producers. Originally this resource was the fishery, and the economy was wholly dependent on it. Today the resource-based economy has diversified to include mineral, oil and hydroelectric developments.\nAgriculture\nAgriculture has been of minor importance in Newfoundland because of the poor soil and adverse climate. Less than one per cent of the agricultural land in Canada belongs to Newfoundland and Labrador, and about half of it is confined to the northern Avalon and Burin Peninsulas. Nevertheless, there are scattered pockets of fertile land and conditions are suitable for the growth of hay and pasture crops.\nIn 2012, the most abundant vegetable crops were potatoes , carrots , rutabagas and cabbage . Also of importance are fruit crops, namely blueberries, strawberries and cranberries , with the farmland devoted to cranberries increasing 850 per cent between 2006 and 2011.\nMining\nMining and minerals is one of Newfoundland and Labrador’s most valuable natural resources. Minerals mined in the province include iron ore, nickel, copper, zinc, gold, aggregates, cobalt, silver, dolomite, limestone, peat and pyrophyllite. Of these minerals, iron ore accounts for well over half the value of the industry, followed by nickel and copper. The total value of mineral shipments was $4.6 billion, a 22 per cent increase from 2010, due largely to higher production levels and prices.\nEnergy\nEnergy is Newfoundland and Labrador’s largest export, as the province uses only a fraction of the energy it produces, and an even smaller portion of the energy it is potentially capable of producing. Electricity is provided by two companies: Newfoundland Power; and Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro. There are several hydroelectric power plants, the largest being Churchill Falls Generating Station. Following the Robert Bourassa Generating Facility in Québec, Churchill Falls is the second largest hydroelectric plant in North America, with a generating capacity of over 5,400 megawatts (MW). In 2012, the provincial government approved the Lower Churchill Project, a hydroelectric development to take place in two phases: Muskrat Falls and Gull Island, both in Labrador. The project represents the best undeveloped hydroelectric source in North America, with an expected capacity of about 3,000 MW.\nWith respect to oil, there are four major offshore projects in production: Hibernia, Terra Nova, White Rose and, come 2017, Hebron. In 2010, these offshore projects accounted for about 10 per cent of crude oil production in Canada.\nDecisions of the Supreme Courts of Newfoundland and of Canada in 1983 and 1984 declared that ownership of offshore resources (specifically the Hibernia oil field) was federal. However, on 11 February 1985 an agreement — called the Atlantic Accord — was signed between the Newfoundland government and the new federal Conservative administration, giving Ottawa and St John's joint say over offshore oil and gas management and allowing the province to tax the resources as if they were on land.\nForestry\nBoth Newfoundland and Labrador have substantial forests. As of 2011, there were 10,730 hectares of forested land in the province, 26 per cent of which were stocked for harvesting purposes. The forestry industry itself directly or indirectly employed 5,500 people in 2009 and was worth approximately $250 million.\nFisheries\nAfter its discovery around 1497, the Island depended on cod fishing for nearly 400 years, until forest and mineral resources began to be exploited. Before 1930 the fishing industry concentrated on the production and sale of salted and sun-cured cod. The advent of quick-freezing and of boats capable of transporting the frozen product to market radically changed the industry. Year by year the percentage of salted cod produced and sold declined, whereas the percentage of fresh-frozen fish species such as cod, turbot, plaice and redfish increased, and the principal market shifted to the US.\nChanges in the fishery since 1930 meant more employment on shore in the processing plants and fewer people to secure the catch. In many settlements along the coast fishermen augmented their income seasonally by catching lobster, salmon, caplin, herring, mackerel, squid, eels, scallops and crab. On 2 July 1992, the federal government declared a complete moratorium on the northern cod fishery in an attempt to save the stocks after years of overfishing. As compensation, 25,570 unemployed fishermen received from $250 to $400 per week. The program expired in May 1999.\nToday, the industry has largely shifted toward shellfish. In 2012, the total value of fish landings (i.e. catch brought ashore), was about $575 million, with shellfish making up 83 per cent of this income. Snow crab was the most valuable species in this category, followed by shrimp and surf clams. Groundfish, such as turbot, cod and yellow tail flounder, are also caught in the province’s waters, as are pelagics such as herring and mackerel . Sealing also accounts for a small portion of annual landed values (less than one per cent in 2012).\nIndustry\nThe most significant industrial activities are based on local raw materials, such as fish processing plants. Tourism is also an important contributor to the economy. In 2012, over 504,400 tourists visited the province, an increase of almost 10 per cent over 2011.\nTransportation\nIn the early years of settlement all transportation was by boat or, in the north during winter, by dog team. The establishment of railways, roads and airports brought changes. The trans-insular railway from St John's to Channel-Port aux Basques started in the 1880s and quickly developed branch lines to Argentia in Placentia Bay, Bay de Verde in Conception Bay, Trepassey in the southern Avalon and Bonavista. Branches were later built to Lewisporte on Bay of Exploits and to Stephenville. The line later operated by CN was narrow gauge and primitive, but it provided an essential service and fostered development across the Island throughout the first half of the 20th century. The railway was closed entirely in September 1988.\nHighway development was rudimentary up to 1949. Roads were local, narrow and generally unpaved. A continual road-building and -improving program since the 1950s has provided an Island-wide road network, which is mostly paved and includes the Trans-Canada Highway from St John's to Channel-Port aux Basques.  A few important offshore islands (e.g., Fogo, Ramea, Bell and the Little Bay Islands) have ferry service, while others (e.g., Random, Twillingate and Greenspond) are now linked by causeways. Communities in Labrador are linked by the Trans-Labrador Highway.\nIn addition to ferry service linking the offshore island, there is intra-provincial ferry service between Newfoundland and the Labrador mainland, as well as a ferry from Port Aux Basques to Sydney, Nova Scotia, and another from Fortune to St Pierre et Miquelon.\nBush flying has been important in Newfoundland since the 1920s, and some isolated areas still rely on ski- or float-equipped small aircraft or helicopter service for mail and emergencies.\nIn addition to the eight major airports serving Newfoundland and Labrador (located in St John's, Gander, Deer Lake, Stephenville, Happy Valley-Goose Bay, St Anthony, Churchill Falls and Wabush) the province also has 13 community airstrips in Labrador and eight community strips in Newfoundland. National and regional airlines provide regular scheduled service to and from these points.\nThe strategic location of Newfoundland made it a logical point for the initial attempts to cross the Atlantic by air. The first successful flight was that made by Alcock and Brown 14-15 June 1919 from St John's to Clifton, Ireland, in a two-motor biplane. There were many subsequent crossings from Newfoundland in the 1920s and 1930s, culminating with the ferrying of thousands of bombers from Gander to England during the Second World War (see Ferry Command ); there was also flying-boat service from Botwood, and regular transatlantic air service via Gander in the pre-jet era. Gander continues to serve as an international crossroads for aircraft carrying goods and people to distant corners of the world.\nGovernment and Politics\nProvincial Government\nThe provincial legislature of Newfoundland (officially called the House of Assembly) has 40 seats. As in other provinces, it is modelled on the British parliamentary system, and a general election is held every four years. The formal head of government and representative of the Crown is the lieutenant-governor , who is appointed by the prime minister for a period of at least five years (see Newfoundland and Labrador Lieutenant-Governors ).\nThe premier and actual head of government is the leader of the political party holding the most seats in the legislature. The Cabinet , comprising the ministers of all government departments, is chosen by the premier from his or her caucus. Areas of provincial and federal jurisdiction are specified in the Constitution Act of 1867 .\nNaval Law — Confederation\nDue to its original status as a fishing outpost, Newfoundland was initially ruled under British naval law. Granted its first government in 1699 under the King William’s Act, Newfoundland began permanent settlement. However, even with a growing and diversifying population, British naval rules were still used to govern the area.\nNewfoundland was granted representative government in 1832. A governor and council, appointed by the British government, held most of the power. A House of Assembly was elected by the people by open ballot and legislation had to pass both chambers. This unworkable form of government was replaced by popular demand in 1855 with responsible government based on the British parliamentary system.\nIn 1934, following the onset of the Great Depression and while saddled with crushing debts, the Dominion of Newfoundland reverted to crown colony status and was governed by a commission of government consisting of a British governor, three British commissioners and three Newfoundlanders, all appointed by the British government.\nFrom 1832 to 1933, no enduring political party with a strongly defined political ideology emerged. The Liberal, Conservative or People’s parties were in fact loose coalitions of individual politicians and special-interest groups. As with most other provinces, religion, ethnicity and social status were strong factors in early politics. For example, the Catholic Liberal Party in the mid-1800s was dedicated to advancing the interests of Newfoundland’s Irish community. Parties also coalesced around issues such as Confederation with Canada, the building of a railway and fishermen's interests versus those of the fish merchants.\nSmallwood Era: 1949–72\nThe campaign for Confederation that culminated successfully in 1949 was led by Joseph R. Smallwood , a journalist, radio broadcaster and businessman. In two general referenda, Newfoundlanders voted by a narrow margin to join Canada. A lieutenant-governor was appointed and Smallwood was asked to form an interim government. In the new province’s first general election, and the first election since 1932, Smallwood’s Liberals took 22 seats, the Conservatives five and an Independent one. The split represented not only the outports versus St. John’s, but the confederates against the anti-confederates. (See also Newfoundland and Confederation ; Confederation’s Opponents .)\nSmallwood’s Liberals continued to dominate Newfoundland’s politics throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Weakened by conflicts between the premier and some powerful Cabinet ministers, and by adverse reactions in the press, the Liberals lost the election of 1972.\nMoores, Peckford and Rideout: 1972–89\nThe Progressive Conservative Party won the 1972 election under the leadership of Frank Moores , who served as premier until 1979. That year, the leadership passed to Brian Peckford , the former minister of mines and energy in Moores’s administration.\nIn 1982, Peckford led his party to a landslide victory, winning 44 of the legislature’s 52 seats. The remaining eight seats were held by Liberals. In 1985, Peckford won a reduced majority, obtaining 36 seats to the Liberals’ 15, and the first NDP representative was elected in Newfoundland history. In the early 1980s, relations between the Newfoundland government and the federal government were strained because of disputes over the ownership of offshore resources, the sale of hydro power in Labrador and the restructuring of the North Atlantic fishing industry.\nA change in government in Ottawa produced considerably better relations between Newfoundland and the federal government. By late 1987, when some provinces were uncertain about free trade with the United States, Peckford came out in strong support of the Mulroney government’s initiatives in that direction. Peckford was also a key supporter of the Meech Lake Accord . His support for the accord was widely credited as the impetus for the deal with Ottawa on the offshore Hibernia oil project (see Hibernia Case ). Tom Rideout succeeded Peckford as premier in 1989 but lost the Tory’s mandate later that year to the revitalized Liberals under the leadership of Clyde Wells .\nWells, Tobin, Tulk and Grimes: 1989–2003\nIn contrast to his predecessors, Wells was adamantly opposed to the Meech Lake Accord and rescinded Newfoundland’s ratification of the deal. His position on constitutional reform was tempered somewhat during the debate over the Charlottetown Accord , and his championing of the “Triple-E Senate” reform package became the critical portion of the accord.\nWhile the 1992 referendum defeated the accord, Newfoundland and Labrador was one of the few provinces to vote in favour. Wells won a renewed mandate in 1993 on a campaign to bring the province’s finances under control. Wells had some success in coming to grips with his province’s debt and deficit despite fierce opposition from organized labour; however, the destruction of the Atlantic fishery increased the province’s financial difficulty. Wells’s successor, former federal cabinet minister Brian Tobin , indicated that new revenues from Hibernia and Voisey Bay would have to play a major role in improving the provincial economy.\nIn 2000, Tobin resigned, returning to federal politics. Beaton Tulk briefly served as interim premier until Roger Grimes won the Liberal leadership convention in 2001. Grimes held office for a short term, from 2001 to 2003.\nWilliams, Dunderdale, Davis and Ball: 2003–Present\nFrom 2003 to 2010, Progressive Conservative leader Danny Williams served as premier. Known for his scrappy nature, Williams defined his tenure by his efforts to garner the province more control and revenues from offshore oil fields. Despite high-profile arguments with the federal government on the topic, Williams was ultimately successful in securing an oil income for Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2008, he announced the province would stop receiving equalization payments for the first time in its history.\nFollowing Williams’s resignation, Progressive Conservative member Kathy Dunderdale was sworn in as Newfoundland and Labrador’s 10th premier on 3 December 2010. Dunderdale was the province’s first female premier. In 2011, she won the regularly scheduled general election with a majority government. However, Dunderdale struggled in the shadow of the popular former premier Danny Williams. She resigned in 2014 amid accusations of mishandling a wave of power outages across the province. Finance Minister Tom Marshall stepped up to serve as interim premier.\nFollowing Marshall’s retirement, Paul Davis was sworn in as the province’s 12th premier on 26 September 2014. Davis — a former provincial cabinet minister — was elected head of the provincial PCs at a leadership convention held earlier that month.\nBased on the province’s fixed election date, Davis was forced to call a general election after just over a year in office. In advance of the vote, the number of seats in the House of Assembly was reduced from 48 to 40 — a PC initiative aimed at cutting costs. The election came at a time when the Progressive Conservatives were struggling in the polls. Commentators dated the decline in support for the party to 2010 and the departure of Williams. On 30 November 2015, the Liberals, under the leadership of Dwight Ball, secured a landslide victory, winning 31 of the province’s 40 seats. The PCs were reduced to seven seats, while the NDP won the remaining two.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nBoth have become very popular spots for ... It was later named Fort Victoria.

It boasts magical coasts, majestic mountains, wild rivers, untrod forests, and untouched lakes. It also boasts sky-scraping cities, sophisticated shopping, and culinary delights. From the Calgary Stampede to the Shakespearean Festival, from ethnic festivals to the changing of the guard in Ottawa, Canada is a fascinating blend of English and French, historic and modern, ceremonial and casual.\nCanada has always had close ties with the United States, as evidenced by the fact that the two countries share the longest unguarded border in the world. In spite of its extensive geographical, cultural, financial, and economic ties with the U.S., however, Canada retains a unique distinction from its southern neighbors.\nMAJOR CITIES\nOttawa\nOttawa (from an Indian word meaning \"near the water\") is a clean, attractive, modern city at the junction of the Ottawa, Rideau, and Gatineau Rivers, about 60 miles north of the New York State border and 120 miles west of Montreal. City residents total over 400,000, and the total metropolitan population is over one million. The climate is healthful and bracing, and the area abounds with opportunities for outdoor activities and family living.\nSamuel de Champlain reached the site of what is now Ottawa in 1613; however, a permanent settlement did not develop until after the Rideau Canal was built in 1827. Originally named Bytown, Ottawa was incorporated as a city under its present name in 1854. It was selected as the national capital by Queen Victoria in 1888.\nAs Canada's capital, Ottawa's main business is government and, as in Washington, DC, little industry exists. Living conditions are similar to those in comparably sized U.S. cities, although social life is geared to demands of diplomatic and government circles.\nSmall Oriental, Lebanese, Portuguese, and Italian colonies exist in Ottawa, but the majority of residents are of British or French descent. Most francophones (35% of the population) are also fluent in English. Approximately 15,000 Americans live in the Ottawa district; they have merged into the population and do not constitute a discernible American colony. About 50 U.S. companies have subsidiaries or affiliates in the area, but only a few have American citizens on their local staffs.\nDuring summer, there is a flow of U.S. tourists through the city, and all year government officials and business representatives visit Ottawa in their respective roles.\nThe diplomatic community is large and growing. Some 146 nations maintain relations with Canada, although only 100 have resident missions in Ottawa. Most are small, with two or three officers and a chief of mission. The only large missions are those of the U.S., U.K., Russia,   France, Germany, and the People's Republic of China.\nEducation\nOttawa's public school system offers instruction from kindergarten through grade 13. There are 55 elementary schools for kindergarten through grade eight, and 15 high schools with English instruction and five with French instruction, both covering grades 9 to 13. Tuition is free for Ottawa residents attending public schools. Children may enter kindergarten at age five, or four if the child will be five before December 31 of that year.\nCourses meet the standards established by the Ontario Ministry of Education. The teacher-student ratio in elementary schools is about 1:16, and in secondary schools about 1:12, ratios which have remained constant for several years.\nParents may place their children in one of two language programs: the immersion program consisting of instruction totally in French in the first few years, and a gradual phasing in of English instruction until the program becomes bilingual; or the core program consisting of at least 20 minutes daily of French instruction from kindergarten through eighth grade and making it optional at some level after that. The core program is not a rigid one and may vary from school to school.\nWhile some students coming from U.S. schools have found the Ottawa high schools somewhat less demanding than their own, most students and parents report few differences or problems. Instructional programs and course offerings vary from school to school within a particular area.\nStudents pursuing a commercial, technical, or vocational curriculum in high school can receive a diploma after grade 12. Those planning to continue their studies beyond high school, especially if applying for admission to colleges and universities in Ontario, have, until recently, been required to complete grade 13, but this proviso is currently being phased out.\nThe Roman Catholic Church maintains a \"separate school\" system in Ottawa composed of 42 primary schools (19 with French instruction, 23 with English); six intermediate schools (five with French instruction, one with English); and two junior high schools, all with English instruction. Tuition through grade 10 is free for Ottawa residents. The curriculum of the \"separate schools\" meets all the requirements of the Ontario Ministry of Education.\nThe schools located in the suburban areas of Ottawa come under either the Carleton Public or Carleton Roman Catholic School Boards. Tuition for schools in both systems is free for residents of the school district. The Carleton Public School Board has 60 elementary schools (including 28 offering French immersion). There are 16 high schools, grades nine through 13, including several with a French immersion program. In addition to the schools offering French immersion, many schools in the Carleton jurisdiction offer French instruction similar to the Ottawa Board's core program. As with the Ottawa Board, parents are advised to check with the school in their neighborhood for specific details regarding the French program.\nThe Carleton Roman Catholic School Board has 51 elementary schools (32 with English instruction, 19 with French), all of which provide kindergarten to grade eight, and five high schools, grades nine through 13. However, after grade 10, the schools are considered private and tuition must be paid by parents. Many English-instruction elementary schools have French programs similar to those offered in the public school system. For details, parents should check with the neighborhood school their children will attend. The Carleton Roman Catholic School Board has no high schools where the language of instruction is French.\nAs in the Ottawa public and separate school boards, the curriculum in both boards in Carleton meets all the requirements of the Ontario Ministry of Education.\nWhile a few American families live in Quebec Province (across the Ottawa River in the greater Hull area), the U.S. Embassy strongly discourages families with school-age children from residing in Quebec. The volatile French-language  issue and related educational controversies, plus frequent teachers' strikes, have created considerable turmoil in the schools. Children not already reasonably conversant in French will probably encounter problems, especially at the high school level, even if enrolled in an English-language school.\nQuebec Province requires all high school students to take French throughout high school and to pass a standard provincial French-language examination before graduation.\nBoth public and separate school systems in Ottawa and the suburban areas offer extracurricular activities similar to those found in the U.S., including athletics, drama, music, and student government. The Ottawa school year, longer than that of the U.S., runs from Labor Day to the last week in June. Students have a week-long vacation at Christmas and a spring break of 10 days (usually in March). Grades are released quarterly.\nOttawa has a number of nursery schools which accept children from age three. In addition, there are a number of \"play schools\" for children 18 months to age four. These are usually two or three half days a week, and these require some type of parent participation.\nThere are two private preparatory schools in the Ottawa area: Elm-wood School for girls (kindergarten through the fourth grade is coeducational; grades five through 13 are only for girls), and Ashbury College for boys (covering grades five through 13). Ashbury enrolls both day and boarding students.\nTwo universities, a technical institute, a teachers' college, and a variety of business and professional schools provide ample opportunity for education on a full-or part-time basis. These include Carleton University (English-language and private, founded in 1942); and University of Ottawa (bilingual and government-supported, founded in 1848). These universities offer a multitude of courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels leading to degrees in liberal arts, sciences, engineering, theology, business administration, education, medicine, nursing, law, and applied sciences. Evening courses at both universities provide many opportunities for both degree and non-degree study. Both universities have extensive evening programs for part-time students as well. Unlike most U.S. colleges, courses are generally conducted on a yearly rather than semester basis.\nAlgonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology, a community college with four campuses, offers a wide range of day and evening courses, one-year certificate programs, and two-and three-year diploma programs. In general, tuition and fees for colleges and universities in Ottawa are less than those of state colleges and universities in the U.S.\nOttawa has four schools for trainable, mentally handicapped children. They are École Jeanne-Lajoie, the Clifford Bowie School, McHugh School (affiliated with the Royal Ottawa Psychiatric Center), and the Crystal Bay School (Carleton Board of Education). One school, Centennial, is for the physically handicapped, and additionally, the Ottawa Crippled Children's Treatment Center has teaching facilities for physically handicapped and autistic children.\nOther educational opportunities include tutoring or group study in languages, music, dance, art, and related activities. These are available for all ages at reasonable cost, usually through the various school systems, Algonquin College, the universities, and the YMCA. Often, however, waiting lists are encountered for those wishing to obtain the most competent instruction available. This is particularly true of French-language courses.\nRecreation\nExtensive opportunities for participation in many recreational sports activities exist in and around Ottawa. In winter, cross-country and downhill skiing are very popular. Trails and slopes abound within a 100-mile radius of the city, ranging from those for the beginner or casual skier to expert slopes for the advanced enthusiast.\nMain roads are kept open and passable in winter, providing access to a number of ski trails and tows in developed ski complexes. Bus service is available. There is one ski area within the Ottawa city limits—Carlington Park. Within an hour's drive are the ski complexes of Camp Fortune and Edelweiss Valley. Camp Fortune, located in Quebec Province (in Gatineau Park) is one of the country's largest ski complexes, offering downhill and cross-country skiing at all levels of difficulty, day and night skiing, instruction, and rentals. It is a 20-minute drive from Ottawa.\nFarther afield, the slopes at Mount St. Marie (Quebec) and Calabogie (Ontario) are 60 miles away. All have a variety of slopes and trails and offer instruction and rentals. Season passes for instruction, rentals, and tows are offered at most ski facilities. The elaborate winter sports resorts of Mount Tremblant, Quebec, can be reached from Ottawa in about three hours.\nOttawa also boasts what is billed as the world's largest outdoor skating rink. During the winter, a five-mile stretch of the Rideau Canal, built by the British after the War of 1812, between Dow's Lake and the National Arts Center is cleared and partially lighted for ice skating. Warming huts and snack bars are located at convenient intervals along the canal. It is not unusual to see business-people, with briefcases in tow, skate to work on the canal.\nAmple facilities for all types of sports have been developed in and around Ottawa, including ice skating arenas, curling rinks, bowling alleys, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and tennis and squash courts. One of the largest, and most unique, is the Nepean Sportsplex located in West Ottawa. Under one  roof it contains an ice skating rink, hockey arena, curling rink, gymnasium, squash courts, indoor swimming pool, auditorium, sauna, pub, and restaurant. It offers instruction for all age groups in sports activities as well as physical fitness classes, ski fitness clinics, arts and crafts, ballroom dancing, and ballet and tap dancing. The sportsplex publishes an annual bulletin of activities; enrollment in some courses is limited, and first preference is given to Nepean Township residents.\nIn the summer, ample opportunity for all types of water sports exists on the Ottawa, Rideau, and Gatineau Rivers, and at nearby lakes. There are several yacht clubs with extensive sailing programs. Beaches within Ottawa city limits are limited to one or two spots along the Rideau River, and Britannia Beach on the Ottawa River; facilities at these places are often crowded. On some of the lakes in the area, both in Ontario and Quebec, there are developed-access roads, beaches, and docks for canoes and boats, while other lakes are more isolated and primitive.\nSome private golf clubs keep their courses open from May to October; several operate their dining rooms all winter. Ottawa also has public courses.\nTennis and squash facilities are available at a number of private clubs, such as the Ottawa Athletic Club. Municipal tennis courts are scattered about the area as well, offering seasonal membership at reasonable cost, or free use on a space-available basis. Instruction is also provided at the private and public tennis facilities.\nBicycling and jogging are very popular during summer, and there are numerous cycling and jogging trails in Ottawa and across the Ottawa River in Quebec's Gatineau Park. Some roads are closed to auto traffic on Sundays for the exclusive use of hikers, joggers, and cyclists. Additional popular participant sports include archery, badminton, bowling, camping, cricket, flying, judo, riding, rugby, rowing, soccer, snowshoeing, and sailing.\nFor the spectator in winter, ice hockey, Canada's national sport, is virtually a mania. National Hockey League games are televised several times a week. In 1992 the Ottawa Senators, a new National Hockey League franchise, began play. The Ottawa Rough Riders represent Ottawa in the Canadian professional football league. The season begins in late July and ends in early December with the Grey Cup finals between the champions of the Eastern and Western Conferences.\nCanadians are avid baseball fans, too, and root for the American major league teams as well as the Canadian entries in Toronto (Blue Jays) and Montreal (Expos). Tickets for Montreal Expo games are sold in Ottawa, and there are chartered buses from downtown Ottawa to the baseball stadium in Montreal for selected games. Stock car racing is held in Stittsville, about 20 miles from Ottawa, in the summer months.\nIn the greater Ottawa area, which includes suburban areas in and around Hull, Quebec, there are numerous parks operated by various municipal, provincial, and federal authorities. Much of the land adjacent to the Ottawa River on the Ontario side is part of the National Capital Commission and is maintained as park land, with hiking and bicycle trails which serve as cross-country skiing trails in winter. In nearby Quebec is the largest of the area parks, Gatineau Park, whose 75,000 acres are maintained by the National Capital Commission. It offers opportunities to painters, hikers, photographers, naturalists, skiers, and picnickers.\nOttawa citizens often form private fishing and hunting clubs, which acquire and stock private lakes within driving distance. Public or crown lands, other than in the protected areas of Gatineau Park, are generally open to hunters and fishermen. Ontario hunting licenses are issued for a nominal fee upon presentation of a valid hunting license from another province or from the U.S., or after passing a basic firearms handling test.\nIn Ottawa there are several museums of interest, including the National Gallery of Art; the Museum of Science and Industry, with unique viewer-participation exhibits especially recommended for school-age children; the Museum of Man; the Bytown Museum (natural history); and Laurier House (former residence of Canadian prime ministers).\nTours of the Parliament buildings are conducted daily throughout the year. During the summer there are sight-seeing tours and moonlight cruises on the Rideau Canal and the Ottawa River. Tours of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police headquarters, the Queen's Printer, the Royal Canadian Mint, and other government agencies can be arranged upon request. Within an easy drive of Ottawa are the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Thousand Islands area, and the restored pioneer settlement of Upper Canada Village.\nToronto and Montreal, Canada's two largest urban centers, are both close to Ottawa—Toronto is 275 miles to the west, and Montreal 120 miles to the east. Toronto, five hours away by road and rail and 55 minutes by air, is the business center of Canada. Here, visitors find a wide variety of reasonable hotel accommodations, extensive shopping facilities, museums, restaurants, and a lively theater district. Montreal is only two hours from Ottawa by road and rail, or 35 minutes by air, and offers a definite French-Canadian atmosphere, which can be enjoyed in a day's visit or for a longer period. There are attractive shopping areas, numerous restaurants, nightclubs, museums, and theaters.\nWashington, DC (Dulles) and Baltimore, Maryland (BWI) airports are connected to Ottawa by direct air service. There are daily flights between Ottawa and BWI. Air travelers to other cities in the U.S. must  make connections in either Montreal or Toronto. Washington, DC is about 600 miles by road from Ottawa, via excellent interstate highways. New York City can be reached in one day by car and is about 455 miles from Ottawa, also via interstate highways.\nEntertainment\nOttawa offers a wide variety of entertainment. The National Arts Center is a cultural center of the first rank, where national and international stars, orchestras, and ballet and theatrical troupes perform regularly. Top-flight soloists and musical groups also are featured at Ottawa and Carleton Universities in programs which are open to the public. The Ottawa Little Theater, with a cast of amateur players, offers a full season of plays.\nOttawa now has some 20 movie houses, and an active National Film Theater whose thrice-weekly showings of classic and foreign films attract crowds of movie buffs to the auditorium in the Public Archives.\nThe National Gallery of Canada owns and displays a small but excellent collection of European and Canadian paintings, and a small group of contemporary American art. Special exhibits are scheduled throughout the year; the opening ceremonies and receptions are well-attended social events. The gallery also sponsors film shows and art lectures.\nThe number and quality of Ottawa's restaurants has been rising, and ethnic cuisine is available in a range of prices. Dancing is provided nightly in hotels, in the National Arts Center, and in several of the nightclubs in town and across the Ottawa River in Hull, Quebec. Another attraction in Hull is the abundance of excellent restaurants which may be found in that predominantly French-Canadian city.\nAnnual events of interest are the Winterlude Festival in February; the Tulip Festival in the latter half of May; and the Central Canada  Exhibition, a week-long country fair held each September.\nBecause of the absence of a language barrier and the openness of Canadian society, Americans blend easily into the local scene. Ottawa has a number of social clubs and public activities which provide opportunities for contact with Canadians. These include an International Women's Club; Boy and Girl Scout groups; and a number of civic organizations, such as Lions, Rotary, Kiwanis, and Optimists.\nToronto\nToronto, Canada's largest city, occupies the site of an old French trading post, Fort Rouillé founded in the 1790s. The city was founded as a British Army garrison town, Fort York, on the shores of Lake Ontario in 1793. It succeeded Niagara-on-the-Lake as capital of Upper Canada in 1797. Chartered as a city in 1834, its name was then changed to Toronto. Toronto served as the country's capital from 1849 to 1851, and from 1855 to 1859.\nThe Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto consists of the city of Toronto and five boroughs, with an estimated population of 4.7 million (2000), and covering an area of about 625 square miles. It is a beautiful city of parks and trees with a mixture of old and new buildings, connected by an excellent network of roads. Tall construction has been kept to a minimum, creating a feeling of spaciousness. The city is the capital of the Province of Ontario, the most populous and industrialized province in Canada. Toronto is the commercial, financial, and industrial center of Canada.\nWith the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, Toronto has become an important shipping center with modern harbor facilities. It is also one of Canada's principal aviation and railway focal points. Well over 1,000 U.S.-controlled companies have plants or representation within the U.S. consular district, and American investment in the area is enormous. This area is said to contain the largest concentration of American-owned or American-controlled plants in any consular district outside the U.S.\nToronto is the headquarters of the Canadian book and magazine publishing industry, three large daily newspapers, and English-language radio and TV broadcasting. It is the center of English-speaking culture in Canada.\nAn estimated 200,000 U.S. citizens live in the district; many are dual   nationals. In addition, tens of thousands of Americans visit the city annually, many of them in connection with conventions, or while en route to and from recreation and vacation areas north of the city.\nEducation\nEnglish is the language of instruction in virtually all public schools and in the universities. For those families who may be interested, French has been offered recently as the language of instruction at certain selected public schools throughout the metropolitan area. French is also taught as a required subject in elementary schools.\nToronto's public school system, used by most expatriates, consists of kindergarten, eight years of elementary school, and four or five years of secondary school, depending on the course selected. The fifth year of high school (grade 13), once necessary for admission to most universities in Ontario, is currently being phased out to put Ontario in step with the rest of Canada and the United States. Standards in Toronto secondary schools are comparable to those in the U.S. Course work may be on a yearly basis or semester system, depending on the school attended. Some students entering during the later high school years may have difficulty with subjects that are not taught as a matter of course in American schools. In Canadian schools, many subjects build on a foundation established the year or two before. It does not seem to be an impossible problem, but young people should come prepared to study hard if they wish to enter a collegiate school. It also should be remembered that, in this bilingual country, French is required of all students. All college entrance examinations are offered in Toronto.\nA separate school system is maintained for Roman Catholic children. Catholic schools receive financial support from the property taxes assessed on those homes occupied by Roman Catholic families. Education is free through grade 10, but tuition must be paid from grade 11. Uniforms are required beginning in ninth grade, and only a couple of Catholic schools are coeducational.\nSeveral excellent private schools accept both boarding and day pupils. Tuition rates are about the same as in comparable schools in the northeastern U.S. These schools are usually not coeducational, and uniforms are worn.\nToronto offers extensive educational opportunities, ranging from the University of Toronto to night courses available at the local high schools.\nThe University of Toronto (founded in 1827), an institution of high academic standing, offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in virtually all fields of endeavor, including the arts, sciences, commerce, medicine, applied sciences, and engineering. The Ontario College of Art and the Royal Conservatory of Music are affiliated with the university.\nYork University is Toronto's second university; founded in 1959, it is much newer, and has faculties of art, administrative studies, environmental studies, fine arts, science, and law.\nAdmission standards at both universities are high, and completion of grade 13 or an equivalent year is mandatory. Undergraduate courses  are offered in the evening, and summer school is also available.\nIn addition to university-level education, the past few years have seen a rise in the number of community colleges. These schools offer post-secondary education in numerous fields, primarily in technical areas.\nThe Toronto area offers exceptional facilities for the education of the mentally retarded. Special full-time programs are available through the public schools; counseling, special classes, and parent relief activities by the Provincial Ministry of Community and Social Services' Surrey Place Center; and a very active association for the retarded with its own nursery and training programs and community activities (summer camp, meetings with specialists, etc.). These combine to provide families with retarded children greater opportunities for development. However, as possibilities may depend on the age of the child and the nature of the retardation, advanced contact with the Metropolitan Toronto Association for the Mentally Retarded and with Surrey Place Center is advised.\nRecreation\nToronto and the nearby areas have much to offer the sports enthusiast, both as spectator and participant. For the spectator there are both professional and amateur hockey, football, soccer, lacrosse, tennis, wrestling, boxing, baseball, and horse racing.\nHockey is by far the most popular professional spectator sport, and is followed by all ages with such enthusiasm that it ranks as a national craze. The Toronto Maple Leafs, an entry in the National Hockey League, play to packed houses at Maple Leaf Gardens from October through April.\nClose behind hockey in popularity is football. The Toronto Argonauts are members of the Canadian Football League. There are two horse racing tracks within the metropolitan area offering both thoroughbred and harness racing. Pari-mutuel betting is permitted. The Toronto Blue Jays baseball team became a member of the American League in 1977, and has gained an enthusiastic following of fans of all ages; they won the Eastern Division pennant in 1985 and the World Series in 1992.\nFor the sports participant, there are swimming, tennis, roller and ice skating, curling, golf, bowling, skiing, fishing, and hunting. Swimming is a popular summer sport and there are many public pools, operated by the Toronto Parks Commission. Because these pools are usually overcrowded on weekends, and because the waters of Lake Ontario are generally considered too cold for anything other than wading, many Torontonians head north to the lake regions for swimming.\nTennis can be played on a number of public courts. Artificial ice skating rinks are located throughout the metropolitan area. Curling, a new game to most Americans, is another popular winter sport, played indoors on ice in arenas built expressly for this purpose.\nNumerous golf courses are in the Toronto area or within a 30-or 40-mile drive. They range from crowded public courses to the exclusive, well-maintained, and expensive private clubs.\nBecause of Toronto's proximity to Lake Ontario and the lake regions to the north, boating is a popular summer pastime, and the city has several yacht clubs. Good fishing and hunting can be found by driving about 120 to 150 miles north of the city. Skiing in and around Toronto is possible, but the real skiing enthusiast will go north 60 to 100 miles to the Collingwood and Gravenhurst areas.\nThe Province of Ontario maintains an excellent system of toll-free expressways and paved secondary roads, making all but the most remote parts of the province accessible by car. However, traffic is heavy, particularly during the summer months. Distance by road (miles) to the following points are: Buffalo, New York, 100; Windsor-Detroit, 235; Ottawa, 286; Montreal, 350; Quebec City, 480; New York City, 478; and Washington, DC, 520.\nToronto's fine park system offers a variety of activities, winter and summer. The pride of the system is Centre Island Park, located on a large island in Lake Ontario off the harbor area, and accessible only by ferry. Ontario Place is also located on a series of man-made islands in Lake Ontario, adjacent to the Canadian National Exhibition grounds, the largest annual exhibition in the world. The Canadian National Exhibition is a popular event. The exhibition features theatrical and musical events, animals, farm and horticultural displays, and an international air show.\nChildren's playgrounds are located throughout the city and, in summer, playground directors supervise children's activities. During winter, the Parks Department operates numerous ice skating and hockey rinks.\nEntertainment\nToronto does not lack cultural or entertainment activities, and offers everything normally found in a cosmopolitan city of comparable size.\nMany first-run and neighborhood movie theaters show American, British, and foreign films. Live theater is also very much in evidence in the Toronto area. The 3,200-seat O'Keefe Centre for the Performing Arts and the Royal Alexandra Theatre both present full seasons of opera, ballet, and musical and dramatic productions, featuring not only the top Canadian companies, but also the best American and British companies. Toronto's concert hall, Massey Hall, a venerable old building with near-perfect acoustics, housed the Toronto Symphony Orchestra until the Roy Thomson Hall was opened. Recitals are given here by touring internationally known artists.\nIn Stratford, Ontario, about 90 miles southwest of Toronto, the Stratford Shakespearean Festival  features world famous actors. Niagara-on-the-Lake, about 80 miles south of Toronto, is the home of the Shaw Festival. Both have become very popular spots for the theater lover during the summer season.\nJazz, folk music, chamber music, and numerous smaller professional and amateur theatrical groups can be found throughout Toronto. The city is purported to be the third most important center for theater in the world, after New York and London. There are also many fine restaurants of every cuisine, cocktail lounges, coffee shops, and nightclubs to suit every taste.\nThe Royal Ontario Museum, the Ontario Art Gallery, the McLaughlin Planetarium, and the Ontario Science Centre provide many hours of interesting viewing.\nMontreal\nMontreal, with an estimated metropolitan population of 3.4 million, is the second largest city in Canada and the second-largest French speaking city in the world. When Jacques Cartier visited the area that is presently Montreal in 1535, he found the Indian village of Hochelaga. The island was visited in 1603 by Samuel de Champlain, but was not settled by the French until 1642, when Sieur de Maisonneuve founded the Ville Marie de Montreal. The city became the center of fur trade and a starting point of expeditions into the interior. Montreal was the last Canadian city held by the French; it surrendered to the British in 1760. From 1844 to 1849, Montreal was the seat of Canadian government.\nMontreal is a cosmopolitan city of charm and variety, where skyscrapers share space with 200-year-old buildings. More than two-thirds of its people are French-speaking. Most of the rest are English-speaking, primarily of English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent. Italians are the third largest ethnic group. About 60% of all the people in Montreal speak English fluently. Several million Americans visit the  Province of Quebec every year, and nearly all visit Montreal.\nThe visitor soon discovers that Montreal has everything needed for a pleasant stay—an absorbing history, a rich and varied culture, outstanding cultural and recreational facilities, comfortable and attractive apartments and houses, a French cuisine which justifies the title of \"Paris of America,\" and over 3,000 restaurants specializing in the foods of many other nationalities. The general standard of living is high. Montrealers, particularly well-to-do French-Canadians, are more fashion-conscious than most Americans and accept European style trends more readily.\nMontreal is located in the southern part of the Province of Quebec, 120 miles east of Ottawa, and about 40 miles from the New York and Vermont borders. By car, it is 400 miles from New York City and 615 miles from Washington, DC. It is situated on an island some 30 miles long, and seven to 10 miles wide, at the junction of the St. Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers. Mount Royal, for which it is named, rises almost in the center of the city to a height of about 765 feet above sea level (the city's average altitude is 63 feet). Most of Mount Royal is a natural park, providing areas for picnics in summer and skating and skiing in winter.\nEducation\nOver the last several years, the school system in Quebec has been in a state of some turmoil because of strikes and linguistic and pedagogical issues. The current provincial language law severely restricts access to English education, although exceptions are granted to children expecting to live in Quebec Province for temporary periods only.\nThe public school system in Montreal consists of 11 grades (grades one through six is elementary school; grades seven through 11 is high school).  Some public schools have kindergartens, but this is not the general rule. The public schools, which are free, are run by two separate school boards: Catholic and Protestant, each administering francophone and anglophone schools. For public school purposes, Protestant generally means non-Catholic. Basic instruction can be in French or English. Moreover, English schools provide French immersion courses in which students may elect to take a portion of their subjects in French.\nStudents entering the Quebec system in the elementary grades will generally find the education to be on a par with that in the U.S., with the bonus of being able to develop a sound knowledge of French. Students entering at the secondary level may, however, encounter problems as a result of French-language requirements and the 11-grade system.\nProvincial regulations require that any student who has been in Quebec for more than two years pass a French equivalency test, given to all 11th-grade students, in order to receive a school leaving certificate, which is the equivalent of a high school diploma. Most students entering in the eighth or ninth grades will therefore require extra tutoring to enable them to attain required proficiency levels in French.\nGrading procedures in Quebec are also different than in the U.S. For the upper grades, class marks, which are reflected in transcripts, are heavily based on standardized provincial examinations, given at the end of the year to all Quebec students.\nThe absence of a 12th grade presents other problems. For the Quebec student, the normal sequence is to graduate from high school at the end of the 11th year, enter the two-year CEGEP system (somewhat like a U.S. junior college), and subsequently go on to a university. Based on recent experience, education authorities will not authorize entry to the CEGEP system for any American student who has not graduated from an American high school. The alternatives for an entering student who would normally enter the 12th grade in the U.S. are to repeat the 11th grade, which Quebec authorities insist is equivalent to the American 12th grade, or to go to school in the U.S.\nAmerican students finishing the 11th grade in Quebec have several alternatives. They may elect to go to a boarding school in the U.S. for the 12th grade, although a graduating student could elect to stay in Montreal, since one private boy's school offers a 12th-grade program. However, no 12th-grade programs for girls exist in Montreal. Alternatively, the student could elect to enter the CEGEP system or apply directly to an American college. Some Quebec students enter U.S. colleges after the 11th grade. The willingness of an American college to consider the application of an American student from Quebec would depend, however, on the success of the student in fulfilling course requirements by the end of the 11th grade.\nMontreal has a number of private schools. Entrance to these schools is based on competitive examinations, and most of them have waiting lists for entry. The role of private schools in Quebec and the extent to which they should receive government support are under review by the provincial government. Most private schools in Quebec require uniforms.\nMontreal has adequate facilities for any type of education from nursery school to the most advanced academic and scientific degrees; private tutoring in any subject; instruction in music, dancing, painting, and the other arts; and special training in crafts, hobbies, sports, gardening, use of power equipment, and other skills.\nThe Montreal school system has facilities at all grade levels for both physical (including the deaf and blind) and learning handicaps.\nThe school year runs from just after Labor Day until mid-June. The opening and closing dates for Catholic and Protestant schools differ by a few days, but time in school is the same. All schools have a five-day week. Schools have a two-week holiday at Christmas and a few days at Easter, usually Holy Thursday through Easter Monday.\nWhile extracurricular activities are similar to those in the U.S., they tend to be less extensive, particularly in the area of sports.\nMontreal's universities have many American students. The largest of the universities is the French-language Université de Montreal, founded in 1876. The Université du Quebec à Montreal (founded in 1969) is also a French-language institution. Most popular with Americans is the English-language McGill University, founded in 1821. The other large English-language institution is Concordia University, formed by the amalgamation of Sir George Williams University and Loyola College. Concordia has an extensive evening program where it is possible to earn degrees in a variety of fields. All of Montreal's universities offer evening extension programs, but not all lead to degrees.\nRecreation\nCanada's national sport is hockey. Canadian children learn to skate almost as soon as they learn to walk, and start playing hockey soon thereafter. In winter, free public skating and hockey rinks are found in every section of the city. During the season, Les Canadiens, Montreal's almost legendary National Hockey League team, play at the Forum. Announcements at Canadiens games are made in both French and English.\nMontreal's professional baseball team, the Expos, is part of the National Baseball League. The Expos utilize the 1976 Olympic Stadium for their home games. Bowling and curling also are popular, and there are a number of clubs and leagues.\nThe city has many public tennis courts, and a number of tennis clubs, some with indoor courts. The Montreal area is dotted with private golf courses. A few public courses exist, but they are usually crowded. Excellent and extensive jogging paths are located on Mount Royal. Joggers also enjoy running along the seven-mile Lachine Canal. The Montreal International Marathon, run in late September, attracts over 10,000 participants annually.\nBoating is popular. Several yacht clubs on Lake St. Louis (about a half-hour by car from the city) and on the Lake of Two Mountains offer keen inter-club competition and a limited cruising area. Most sailboats on Lake St. Louis are center-board types because of the large shoal areas, but there are many larger boats, and the International Dragon Class is very active. Two-to three-week cruises to the Thousand Islands, Ottawa, and the Rideau or Lake Champlain are popular with local yachters.\nMontreal has an excellent range of readily accessible year-round recreational opportunities in Quebec Province and in northern New York and New England. The Laurentian mountain area, which begins about 45 miles from the city and includes Mont Tremblant Park, is one of the most attractive winter and summer resort areas in Canada. Mont Tremblant, 100 miles from Montreal, and Stowe, Vermont, 120 miles away, provide the best skiing in eastern North America. There is limited skiing in Montreal itself on Mount Royal, but the nearest really good skiing areas begin about 50 miles away. Cross-country skiing is very popular both in and outside of Montreal.\nThe many lakes in the Laurentians and other nearby areas provide swimming, boating, and water-skiing. There are good camping facilities and accommodations, from luxury hotels to simple lodgings in all areas.\nFishing and hunting are good and are possible close to Montreal. The lakes, rivers, and streams of the province have a variety of fish; speckled trout are the most common. Partridge are found in most woods. The flyways over Lake St. Francis and Lake St. Peter, each about 75 miles from Montreal, offer some of the finest duck shooting in North America. About 150 miles down the St. Lawrence is the only place in the world for hunting the beautiful snow goose. Deer and bear are found within 100 miles of the city.\nMontreal has 362 parks. The top of Mount Royal has been preserved as a 500-acre natural forest park. Both the Chalet, at the peak, and Beaver Lake, at the beginning of the park area, are popular in winter and summer. The Chalet has a remarkable view of the city. Beaver Lake, an artificial lagoon, is a favorite place for model-boat enthusiasts. In addition to skiing and tobogganing in winter, the Beaver Lake Pavilion has a large ice skating rink. Mount Royal also has bridle paths for horseback riders.\nAnother delightful park is located on St. Helen's and Notre Dame Islands in the middle of the St. Lawrence, between the harbor and the seaway. It has an amusement park (the site of Expo '67), swimming pools, picnic areas and playgrounds, and other attractions, including Montreal's Military and Maritime Museum. Its Helene-de-Champlain Restaurant, in a castle-like chalet, provides a picturesque setting and good food.\nThe Garden of Wonders, better known as the Children's Zoo, is a fascinating feature of Lafontaine Park, which also has two lagoons. Rowboats are for rent, and rides can be taken in a miniature paddle-wheeler \"showboat\" and in a miniature train.\nThe extensive greenhouses of Montreal's Botanical Gardens, conveniently located on a principal street, are open all year; its outdoor gardens are open from May or June to October. There are spectacular exhibitions in November and at Easter, and excellent shows at various other times.\nMontreal has a number of fine museums. The best historical museum is the Chateau de Ramezay, built in 1705 as the residence for the governor of Montreal. It was the headquarters of the American Army of Occupation in 1775-76, and well-known Americans who stayed there included Benjamin Franklin, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, and Benedict Arnold. Redpath Museum has interesting geological and zoological exhibits and Indian relics. McGill University's McCord Museum, now associated with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, has a unique collection of Canadian historical and North American archaeological exhibits. The Wax Museum has more than 200 life-size figures, depicting scenes from Canada's earliest history to modern times. The Bell Telephone Company of Canada has an industrial science museum with original equipment, replicas, and pictures of communications from ancient sight and sound signals to Telstar. Many of these exhibits can be seen in operation.\nThe Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, entering its second century, is located in the city's center, and houses a formidable collection of paintings, decorative arts, and sculptures, as well as ancient glass and textile collections.\nSeveral Catholic churches have museums with collections of paintings and religious and other exhibits. The museum of Notre Dame de Bon Secours Church, also known as the Sailor's Church, has model ships presented by sailors and an excellent collection of fine dolls. There is also the Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened prior to the 1976 World's Fair held in Montreal. A planetarium and an aquarium were established within the city during 1966-67.\nIn February 1990, the Montreal Insectarium opened to the public. Built to resemble a stylized insect, the building has a total area of   approximately 7,000 square feet and includes exhibition areas, open-space laboratories, a multipurpose hall and a 40-seat theater.\nEntertainment\nNowhere is Montreal's cosmopolitan nature better reflected than in its entertainment. Plays may be seen throughout the year in both English and French, with occasional productions in other languages. A mobile summer theater for children is operated by the Montreal Parks Department. The Montreal ballet company, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, performs regularly, and there are other ballet performances as well.\nMontreal's modern Place des Artes is the city's center for symphonies, ballets, stage productions, and visiting national and international performers. Place des Arts houses three theaters, the largest seating approximately 3,000 people. Throughout the year, there are many vocal and instrumental recitals. The International Music Competition, held in May or June of each year, is one of the most important artistic events held in Montreal. The Montreal International Jazz Festival, held in June or July, features concerts and shows by many of the world's great jazz musicians. The World Film Festival is held annually in August and September.\nThere are many movie houses, both downtown and in the neighborhoods. New American films are shown at the same time as in the U.S. Films are in English and French. A few theaters show films in their original languages, with English or French subtitles.\nThe midwinter Carnival festivities in Quebec City are attended by many people from Montreal, Quebec, New England, New York, and elsewhere. The Sherbrooke Festival des Cantons features Quebecois shows, horse-pulling, and gourmet cuisine.\nAlmost every social group contains a number of the Americans living in Montreal. An American Women's Club meets regularly for lunch and has annual bazaars, fashion shows, dances, and bridge tournaments for the benefit of Canadian charities. The Montreal Post of the American Legion is also active. No other American community organizations exist.\nQuebec City\nQuebec City is the provincial capital and the center of French Canada. The city takes its name from an Algonquin Indian word meaning where the river narrows, but its many residents, although North American, bear the clear imprint of their French ancestry and culture. The city is located on the site of the old Indian town of Stadacona and was visited by Jacques Cartier in 1535 and 1541. In 1608, Samuel de Champlain established a trading  post here which became the first permanent settlement. The area was briefly controlled by the British and was the capital of New France from 1663 to 1763. It also served as capital of Canada from 1851 to 1855, and from 1859 to 1867.\nGreater Quebec is a metropolitan area of about 646,000. Quebec, the largest municipality, is divided into two distinct areas. These are Lower Town (which winds around the base of the promontory, along the banks of the St. Lawrence into the St. Charles River Valley), and Upper Town (on heights 200 to 300 feet above the St. Lawrence). When viewed from the sister city of Levis (part of Greater Quebec), Upper Town has a distinctly Old World appearance, including the imposing roof and turrets of the Château Frontenac. Stone walls encircle part of the business and residential section of Upper Town and reach to the ramparts of the Citadelle. The area within the old city walls is recognized as a historic monument. Building restrictions and the tasteful restoration of old houses preserve the Old World flavor of the area. Most buildings in the city have painted tin roofs, dormer windows, colorful shutters, and wooden doors.\nThe city's population is about 96% French-speaking. Most of the remainder are English Canadians, and only a small minority is of other national and racial origins. In the surrounding countryside, the population is almost totally French-speaking, and is descended from French colonists led by Champlain, who established the first settlement in 1608. Although they are undeniably French in origin, their attitudes and viewpoints reflect the fact that development of their distinctive society has taken place in North America.\nQuebec harbor is one of the most important in Canada. It has extensive passenger and freight-handling facilities, including large elevators for the transshipment of grain. Quebec is a regularly scheduled port of call for steamship lines during the ice-free months from April through November and, for several years, has enjoyed an increasing volume of winter freight traffic as well.\nThe Port City life has been reanimated at the Vieux-Port de Quebec. La Societé du Vieux-Port, commissioned by the Canadian Government, manages this facility which consists of a walkway, outdoor amphitheater, marina, market, and residential units.\nIn 1977, developers and artists pooled their resources to rescue North America's oldest neighborhood from an undeserved fate. Warmed with color and flowers, the Quartier Petit Champlain is once again a community and a real delight. Its beautifully restored houses shelter more than 50 businesses, outdoor cafes and restaurants ranging from classic French to European fast-food, art galleries, a theater, and charming boutiques. One can meet artists and crafts-people in their studios, or in the street, where pedestrians, musicians, clowns, and jugglers mingle.\nCurrently 2,000 Americans are registered with the U.S. Consulate and about 7,700 Americans live within the district, many of them French-Canadian descent.\nEducation\nQuebec's public and private schools, from preschool through eighth grade, are generally comparable to American schools. High schools, however, are organized somewhat differently and, in general, are less demanding than their American counterparts.\nThe final year of high school is the 11th year of studies. Provincial regulations require that every student have two years of high school French and pass both oral and written examinations in French before graduation. The exception to that rule is only for dependents of diplomats, who are exempt from the language law, and who may attend either English-or French-language schools.\nPublic schools in the province are Catholic or Protestant, but the emphasis on religion has diminished considerably in recent years. Quebec now generally minimizes the importance of religious study much the same as in U.S. public schools.\nQuebec has no French-language Protestant schools, public or private. Protestant parents are free to enroll their children in the French-language Catholic schools located throughout the city.\nExcellent boarding schools are found throughout the neighboring New England states and in Montreal.\nThere are a number of specialized schools and organizations in the area for physically and mentally handicapped individuals. Children with learning disabilities attend special classes in the regular school system. For those more severely handicapped, special education, including vocational training, is available through grade nine. Interested individuals should contact the U.S. Consulate in Quebec for further information.\nAt Laval University (founded in 1852), many faculties, such as medicine and law, accept students only at the graduate level. Other faculties accept students at what would be considered the undergraduate level. Students wishing to enter Laval should discuss the matter with university authorities.\nLaval offers evening courses during the academic year in a variety of subjects at the undergraduate level. Instruction in these courses is in French. Laval also offers an intensive summer French-language program which is well known in the U.S. and is attended by several thousand Americans each year. At other times, French-language instruction is offered in the evening at both beginning and advanced levels.\nRecreation\nMany opportunities exist for ice skating, skiing, and other winter sports in Quebec City. Good ski slopes are within 30 miles of town. Mount Ste. Anne—the highest—has a vertical drop of over 2,000 feet and is one of the best ski mountains in eastern North America. Cross-country skiing is enjoying a major boom, and cross-country trails are maintained in a great number of federal and provincial parks within easy driving distance. For those who prefer to break trail on their own, the open rolling countryside near the city offers virtually unlimited opportunities.\nIn winter, two or three professional ice hockey games are played each week by the National Hockey League's Quebec Nordiques. The Coliseum was recently renovated and enlarged. Announcements at Nordiques games are made only in French. Several other ice arenas in the municipal area provide instruction and organized competition in both hockey and figure skating.\nQuebec City's premier cold-weather event is the annual 10-day Winter Carnival, held in February. There are ice sculpture contests, a majestic ice castle on Place du Palais, a canoe race on the St. Lawrence, and two parades through city streets.\nSeveral indoor curling clubs admit both men and women to membership. There is great interest in this ancient sport here, and membership in one of these clubs affords an opportunity to meet a large number of business and professional persons.\nThere is good hunting and fishing close to Quebec. The provincial government runs camps in the Laurentides Park. Summertime can be very pleasant in Quebec, in spite of the overwhelming number of tourists who crowd into the city. Golf, tennis, sailing, and fishing are available near town, as well as swimming, hiking, and camping.\nQuebec City is the gateway to the Laurentides Park, which begins about 30 miles north of the city and is easily accessible on one of the newest and most modern highways in the province. The areas north and east of Quebec City abound in wooded hills and mountains, with numerous small lakes perfect for flat-water canoeing and boating. These areas can be reached in a short time on good roads. Fishing and hunting are excellent. There are opportunities for day-hiking and backpacking in the park, particularly in the valley of the Jacques Cartier River. The valley also affords supervised rock-climbing, as well as white-water canoeing and kayaking.\nA popular summer resort is located at Murray Bay (La Malbaie), on the north shore 100 miles down-river from Quebec. The principal hotel is the Manor Richelieu, operated by the Quebec Government. There is a fine swimming pool and golf course, both of which are open to the public. Another resort, Tadoussac, is 50 miles farther down-river at the mouth of the Saguenay River, but this resort is primarily popular with older people, and there is little excitement or activity to be found. Murray Bay can be reached by train, car, or the Saguenay excursion boats in half a day. Tadoussac can be reached by car, although the road is not well surfaced. The trip is best made by boat.\nBaie St. Paul, on the north shore 89 miles down-river from Quebec, has an art center and several art galleries. This artists' haven is also a favorite among crafts-people.\nChicoutimi, a city of 60,000, located 130 miles north of Quebec City, is a tourist base for exploring the Saguenay area. The Saguenay River itself is a fjord with steep canyon walls which can be viewed from sight-seeing boats from June to September. The city is also surrounded by true \"wilderness,\" offering excellent hunting and fishing as well as numerous other outdoor activities.\nThe south shore of the St. Lawrence and the Gaspé Peninsula has many small resorts of interest during the warmer months, and the trip around this spectacular peninsula can be made comfortably in four or five days by car. Lake St. Joseph and Lake Beauport, about 30 to 15 miles, respectively, from Quebec, are pleasant places to spend a day or weekend during summer.\nAn attraction only five miles from Quebec is the thunderous Mont-morency Falls; just beyond that lies the Island of Orleans, accessible by bridge, which retains much of the charm of the early French-Canadian countryside. The island has several good restaurants and numerous artisan stores offering handwoven articles and ceramics. In summer, visitors can buy fresh fruit at farmers' stands, or pick their own in the fields.\nA short distance farther along the north shore of the river is Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Refuge, where virtually the entire east coast population of snow geese congregate in a vast honking horde twice a year, in the spring and fall, on their way to breeding or wintering grounds.\nEntertainment\nQuebec has several good movie theaters showing American, French, French Canadian and, occasionally, English films. One or two theaters show English-language pictures, but most American films are shown with French soundtracks.\nMany visiting companies and artists stop in Quebec. The Quebec Symphony Orchestra, the oldest in Canada, has a full season. There are several avant-garde stock theater groups of considerable talent. An opera company performs occasionally during the winter season, and gifted local folk singers offer concerts. The Grand Théâtre, dedicated in January 1971, has a large auditorium for music, plays, and opera, and a small auditorium for experimental theater. The Grand Théâtre is the home of the Quebec Symphony Orchestra. Several societies, such as the Institut Canadien, offer interesting series of lectures and concerts.\nThe Quebec Winter Carnival is a major event in the area. For three weeks before the beginning of Lent, little else occupies the minds and time of the Quebecois. Among the principal events are the masquerade and regency balls, peewee hockey played by boys 12 and under, boat races over and around the ice floes on the St. Lawrence River, dogsled races, huge parades, and street dancing. A three-story palace is constructed of enormous blocks of ice, and ice snow statues are carved and placed along many city streets.\nDuring July, the city sponsors a 10-day music festival offering jazz, folk, rock, and classical music in several public parks in the old town. The city, in general, is particularly lively during summer as numerous Quebecois stroll through the historic area and frequent outdoor cafes.\nThe historic area of Quebec City is beautifully preserved and is completely surrounded by ramparts. The city's oldest hotel, the Chateau Frontenac, and the Citadel, a star-shaped military fortress, are two main historical attractions.\nQuebec boasts some excellent restaurants offering French cuisine, among them the Continental, Marie Clarisse, Rabelais, and the Serge Broyere; and out of town, the Manoir St. Castin at Lac Beauport. The variety of nightclubs is limited.\nThe recently-opened Museum of Civilization is a popular attraction in Quebec City. This museum contains an entire hall dedicated to the history of games—board games, cards, gambling, toys, and other recreational activities.\nThere are few resident Americans in Quebec, and they are well integrated into the community. A group called the American Colony Club meets infrequently, but participates in community activities and organizes an annual Thanksgiving dinner, a children's Christmas party, a summer picnic, and receptions. Rotary Club also has a chapter in the city.\nThe city's tourism office, located at 60 rue d'Auteuil, has advice and free booklets for tourists.\nVancouver\nVancouver, the third largest city after Toronto and Montreal, is the largest, most cosmopolitan, and most exciting city in western Canada. Strategically located in the extreme southwest corner of mainland British Columbia, it is the gateway to Alaska, to the Pacific Ocean, to the American Northwest, and to the Orient. The provincial capital and seat of government is Victoria, on Vancouver Island.\nThe first settlement in the area was established by 1865 and called Granville. It was incorporated as a city in 1881 and named for Captain George Vancouver. Vancouver's development was aided by the completion of the trans-Canada railroad in 1887. Fire destroyed Vancouver in 1886, the year it was incorporated. Reconstruction began immediately and an area known as Gastown became the new city center. The Gastown area declined when the commercial district expanded away from the waterfront; in 1969 restoration of Gastown began and it was preserved as a vital link to the city's past.\nAs of 2000, Vancouver had an estimated population near 2 million. It is by far the largest city in the Province of British Columbia. Vancouver is located on the eastern shore of the Strait of Georgia, between the Fraser River on the south and Burrard Inlet on the north. The city has a beautiful, landlocked, ice-free harbor, with wooded mountains to the north rising to 4,000 feet and snow-capped much of the year. Its glittering skyscrapers are softened by a dazzling array of parks that bring British Columbia's great outdoors to the heart of the urban setting. At its doorstep are 10 beaches and miles of sheltered cruising waters, with the lighted ski runs on Grouse Mountain only a half-hour to the north.\nVancouver's year-round port handles more dry tonnage than all five U.S. West Coast ports combined. The port is a hub for most passenger ships and Alaskan cruises from May to October.\nThe climate is comparable to that of Seattle, with few extremes of heat or cold. The temperature rarely exceeds 80°F in summer, and winters have relatively few days when the temperature drops below the freezing point. The mean temperature is 63°F in summer and 36°F in winter. Rainfall averages 59 inches  annually in Vancouver, but is considerably less in the outlying districts south of the city. There is also very little snowfall. Living conditions are comparable to those of many other large modern cities in North America, with the additional attraction of extensive and readily accessible outdoor recreational facilities.\nThe U.S. consular district covers both the Province of British Columbia and the Yukon Territory—a total of 573,331 square miles. It is an area greater than California, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, and Montana combined. The population is relatively small in British Columbia (3,105,000 in 1989) and in the Yukon (29,000 in 1990), but British Columbia is Canada's second fastest growing province.\nPeople from the prairie provinces, as well as immigrants to Canada, are moving into British Columbia in large numbers, attracted by the climate and economic opportunities. These include Australians, Indians, Iranians, Germans, Dutch, Italians, Scandinavians, French, Swiss, Filipinos, Chinese, and Japanese. Next to San Francisco and New York City, Vancouver has the third largest Chinatown in North America. As a result, many shops specializing in ethnic goods or foods are found in the city, in addition to a host of Chinese restaurants. Chinese laborers were instrumental in building the Canadian-Pacific Railway in this part of Canada.\nCurrently, about 60,500 American citizens reside in British Columbia and the Yukon. Tourism plays a major role in the economics of the province. About two million Americans visit \"The Evergreen Playground\" each year. Vancouver was the site of the world's fair—Expo '86—in 1986. It was opened on May 2 by the Prince and Princess of Wales, Charles and Diana.\nEducation\nPublic and private schools are on a par with those in the U.S. The Vancouver public school system consists of roughly 95 elementary schools and 18 secondary schools. Roman Catholic schools are run by the church and charge monthly tuition. One public elementary school offers a French immersion program through sixth grade. French is also offered as an optional subject, along with other foreign languages at the secondary level.\nVancouver has three provincial universities: the University of British Columbia (founded in 1890 at Point Gray), University of Victoria (founded in 1902, elevated to university status in 1963), and Simon Fraser University (founded in 1963 at Burnaby).\nIn addition to credit and non-credit programs and courses offered by technical institutes, vocational training centers, and community colleges, Vancouver and the surrounding municipalities offer adult education day and evening classes. Subjects range from strictly academic courses to instruction in sewing, golf, and ceramics. Fees are moderate.\nVancouver has about 30 educational facilities for the mentally retarded and physically handicapped. Treatment is available for most age groups in schools specializing in disabilities ranging from autistic and behavior disorders to the multi-handicapped. Schools specifically for the deaf and blind are also available. A complete listing of facilities may be obtained by writing directly to the U.S. Consulate General.\nRecreation\nVancouver is a sportsman's paradise. There are a number of excellent golf courses, both public and private, where the visitor can play most of the year. The city also has many public tennis courts. Horseback riding is available, but expensive. The surrounding mountains offer skiing from December through April. Popular runs are found on Seymour and Grouse Mountains in North Vancouver; Garibaldi Park, 30 miles from Vancouver; Whistler Mountain, some 75 miles away; and Mount Baker, east of Bellingham, Washington, where skiing is possible most of the year. Also available are numerous cross-country trails, some close by on the North Shore. There are several public and private ice skating rinks.\nBoating and water-skiing are very popular, and numerous small-boat launching sites and mooring facilities are found in the surrounding salt water. Many of the interior lakes also provide boating facilities. The boating season runs from late May through September. Bowling (both indoor and lawn variety) and curling are popular. The many mountain trails offer good hiking possibilities.\nFor the spectator-sports fan, Vancouver has three professional teams. The British Columbia Lions play in the Western Conference of the Canadian Football League; the Vancouver Canucks are in the National Hockey League; and the Vancouver Canadians, the top farm club of the Milwaukee Brewers, are members of the Pacific Coast League. Major U.S. sporting events are telecast in Vancouver as well.\nBritish Columbia is famous for its fishing and hunting. Freshwater trout and salmon are the most popular catches of the sport fisherman. For big game, including bear, deer, moose, mountain goat, and wild fowl, the hunter usually has to travel some distance into the interior of the province.\nCamping is a popular summer activity, but facilities are often rough in the interior regions.\nNumerous points of scenic interest are within easy driving distance of Vancouver. Vancouver Island, the largest island on the west coast of North and South America, features the provincial capital of Victoria, unusual gardens, beaches, and mountain scenery. One of the most scenic attractions in the Province of British Columbia, Victoria is just an hour's drive along the highway overlooking Howe Sound. The spectacular Fraser River Canyon is several hours away via Hope and Cache Creek.\nIn the interior of the province, east of Quesnel, lies the historic ghost town of Barkerville, a booming gold town a century ago. The Rocky Mountain Resorts of Banff and Lake Louise, about 650 miles east, just across the British Columbia-Alberta border, can be reached by car, rail, or plane almost all year. Alaska can also be reached via weekly sailings from Vancouver.\nMetropolitan Vancouver contains many attractive parks, the largest being world-famous Stanley Park on a 1,000-acre forested peninsula adjacent to the downtown area. Governor General Lord Stanley, in whose honor the NHL's championship cup was named, dedicated the peninsula as a park in 1889, a year after its official opening. Stanley's life-size statue graces the park's entrance. It is a prime tourist attraction, with a zoo, gardens, one of North America's finest aquariums, picnic areas, woodland trails, playgrounds, and scenic viewpoints overlooking the entrance to Vancouver harbor. The MacMillan-Bloedel Conservatory is in the park. Queen Elizabeth Park, south of the downtown section, is another picturesque area, noted for its flowers and views of the city and surrounding area.\nVancouver has a strong international flavor, with large Italian, Greek, and East Indian communities. The city has the second largest Chinatown in North America. Every possible kind of ethnic cuisine is served somewhere in the city.\nGastown is Vancouver's \"heritage\" area—a colorful redevelopment of the original settlement. Cobbled streets, a steam clock restored heritage buildings housing shops and restaurants, a town square and a statue of Vancouver pioneer Gassy Jack are all part of the ambience. Handicrafts and local artists flourish here.\nShopping in Vancouver tends to be mall oriented and, because it is a port city, many exotic goods can be found. The corner of Georgia and Grandville is the key to a major downtown shopping area. The city has two underground malls, Pacific Centre and Vancouver Centre. A $100-million extension to the Pacific Centre complex has made it one of the largest retail-office complexes in Canada. It is linked to the rest of the shopping center by overhead walkway and a tunnel. The extension added 100 stores to the existing 127 retail outlets, and features a covered central atrium and a waterfall.\nNumerous beaches exist in Vancouver proper and in north and west Vancouver, although the water is usually chilly, even in summer.\nVancouver also has a small but growing art gallery, an excellent maritime museum, and a new planetarium. The Anthropological Museum at the University of British Columbia is excellent.\nEntertainment\nEntertainment to suit all tastes is available at some time during the year. The excellent Vancouver Symphony Orchestra has a regular concert season extending from fall to spring. This and other orchestras, an opera company, soloists, and first-class theatrical companies, ballets, and choruses from many parts of the world perform at the modern Queen Elizabeth Theater, which has a capacity of 2,800.\nVancouver has a large pool of professional actors from which resident theater companies draw for stage productions of a high order. The Playhouse Theater Company, based in the Queen Elizabeth Theater, and the 450-seat Arts Club Theater, located on Granville Island, each offers seven or more major annual productions, ranging from Shakespeare to Tennessee Williams and modern Canadian playwrights.\nThe Waterfront Theater, Carousel Theater (for young people), and City Stage add to the variety of what is available on almost a year-round basis. A six-week Festival of Arts each summer features both local and visiting artists of distinction. A Jeunesses Musicales chapter fosters youthful musical activities in Vancouver and throughout the province. The city has many first-run movie theaters and assorted nightclubs.\nMany cultural events also take place from October to June at the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University.\nThe Pacific National Exhibition (PNE), held the last two weeks of August, draws exhibitors from across Canada, the U.S., and other countries. Many top entertainers perform here during the exhibition's run. The \"midway\" section of the PNE also is open during summer and on weekends during good weather. An Oktoberfest is also held in Vancouver.\nThe excellent main public library has branches in every neighborhood.\nVancouver social life is like that in any large U.S. city. Americans soon find opportunities to make acquaintances among Canadians. People in Vancouver are hospitable and extend numerous invitations to various social or public affairs.\nOrganized groups include, among many others, the Board of Trade, Rotary, the English-Speaking Union, and the Consular Corps—both a men's and women's group. Vancouver has three downtown men's luncheon clubs; the Vancouver Club, the Terminal City Club, and the University Club. All of these offer comfortable, convenient facilities, pleasant associations, and good food. American men and women are welcome to participate in the charitable organizations that exist in Vancouver.\nCalgary\nCalgary is located in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, 3,440 feet above sea level. From the city, one can see jagged peaks of the Rockies rising to a height of 12,000 feet only 65 miles to the west. Calgary is 160 miles north of the U.S. border.\nCalgary, with an estimated population of 888,000 (2000), is one of Canada's  fastest growing cities. It is the center of Canada's oil industry (there are about 400 oil companies producing 90% of Canada's oil in the city) and the heart of an extensive ranching area. Calgary was founded in 1875 when the Royal Northwest Mounted Police established a fort at the junction of the Bow and Elbow Rivers. The Canadian-Pacific railroad reached Calgary in 1883; soon a bustling town had outgrown the fort to become the hub of cattle ranches and meat-packing plants. By 1891, the town had attracted 3,100 people. It was chartered as a city in 1893. By the 1950s, it had grown into a peaceful, prosperous provincial city of nearly 100,000.\nA U.S. consular agency was established at Lethbridge in 1891, soon after railway connections were opened to Great Falls, Montana. This later was closed, and a consulate was established in Calgary in 1906, a year after Alberta became a province. In 1963, that Consulate was made a consulate general. The consular district includes the Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba and the MacKenzie and Keewatin Districts of the Northwest Territories.\nCalgary was the host of the XV Winter Olympic Games in 1988. To prepare for this event, downtown office complexes, hotels, and department stores were connected by climate-controlled elevated skyways.\nEducation\nCalgary has a good public school system, which includes elementary, junior high, senior high, and combined junior and senior high schools. Tuition is free for all Calgary residents attending public schools. Instruction is in English, and in some schools, in French.\nPhysical education is compulsory through grade 10, after which it becomes an extra elective. Inter-school athletic competitions are an integral part of school life. French is, in general, the only language offered through grade 12. Two years of a foreign language are among the requirements for a high school diploma.  Music and art instruction is offered in all grades.\nSeveral private nursery schools and kindergartens are available. Nursery schools generally accept children from the age of three.\nThe Catholic Church maintains a separate system of elementary, junior high, combined elementary and junior high, and high schools. French and Latin are the only languages offered through grade 12. Textbooks are supplied free through grade nine, and no tuition fees are charged for Calgary residents.\nThe University of Calgary gives complete courses in arts, commerce, education, engineering, music, physical education, and science, premed. The student body totals about 20,000.\nThe Southern Alberta Institute of Technology provides educational programs in technology, art, business, trades, correspondence, instruction, and adult education. The institute is operated by the Alberta Department of Education and is financed by the provincial and federal governments.\nMount Royal Junior College is a public institution offering several types of programs: vocational training; high school completion at accelerated rate; course make-up while  studying at the University of Calgary; and a transfer program geared to enrollment at a degree-granting institution.\nThe Calgary School Board offers a wide range of evening courses and services, primarily in high schools. Academic subjects for adults as well as general interest courses are also offered at the University of Calgary and Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.\nCalgary has programs to aid the mentally and physically handicapped and children with learning disabilities. Special educational services provide alternative educational programs for children unable to cope with or benefit adequately from the regular school programs. Emphasis is placed at the elementary level, but programs for some students are available through grade 12. Schooling for the handicapped is also available at the Children's Hospital.\nRecreation\nFootball is the main spectator sport in Calgary, and the Stampeders play in the Western Conference of the Canadian Football League. Beginning with the 1980-81 season, Calgary also has a team in the National Hockey League. The Flames moved to the Canadian city from Atlanta, and play during the winter at the Saddledome, which was also used during the 1988 Winter Olympics.\nSeveral good horse shows are held during the year, and pari-mutuel horse racing is held regularly. Good public and private golf clubs are nearby; both the Banff Springs Hotel and Jasper Park Lodge have excellent courses.\nThe city has several tennis clubs. During the winter many enjoy badminton, curling, and ice skating. Boating and canoeing are also popular. Within the city, many parks and playgrounds have community swimming pools. Bowling, both five-pin and 10-pin, is popular. Downhill and cross-country skiing are available just outside the city limits, as well as on the slopes at Banff and Lake Louise. Several riding academies on nearby ranches offer lessons. Calgary also has an excellent planetarium and zoo.\nA spectacular annual event is the Calgary Stampede, held during the first part of July. This event, which began in 1912, has since grown into a 10-day celebration. Rodeo and western enthusiasts are drawn from all over Canada and the U.S. during this time, when the city completely surrenders to the spirit of the Old West. Besides rodeo programs and chuck wagon races, street dancing, chuck wagons selling flapjacks and bacon, and marching bands are popular. More than half-a-million Americans pass through Calgary every year to see the stampede and to enjoy nearby scenic attractions.\nWithin a few hours of Calgary, in the Canadian Rockies, are some of the most scenic areas of North America: Banff (also known as a center for native arts and crafts), Lake Louise, and Jasper National Park. Banff, about 75 miles to the northwest, may be reached by car in about one-and-a-half hours; another half-hour will take the traveler to Lake Louise. The \"Badlands\" at Drumheller, and the dinosaur burying ground, some 85 miles north and east, are also of interest, as is the Cypress Hills area in the southeastern corner of the province.\nTo the south, straddling the Canadian-U.S. border at the junction of Alberta, British Columbia, and Montana, is Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. This rustic recreation area comprises large park sites of both countries. The oil and natural gas fields in Turner Valley, just southwest of Calgary, are points of interest, as are the Pembina and Leduc oil fields to the north. The tourist may drive on the Alaska Highway to Dawson Creek and beyond. Excellent highways extend into British Columbia through beautiful scenery. The nearest U.S. border points from Calgary are the small Montana towns of Babb, 165 miles to the south, and Sweetgrass, 195 miles to the southeast. Other road mileages from Calgary are: Helena, Montana, 395; Great Falls, Montana, 330; Seattle, Washington, 760; Boise, Idaho, 680; and Salt Lake City, Utah, 995.\nEdmonton, Alberta's capital, is connected to Calgary by an excellent highway and frequent air service.\nBig-game hunting is possible, and antelope, caribou (woodland), bear (black and grizzly), deer, elk, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, and moose are found within easy driving distance of Calgary. On the flyway for millions of migratory water fowl, Alberta offers excellent hunting for several varieties of duck and geese. Pheasant, grouse, partridge, and ptarmigan are hunted in many areas.\nThe larger northern Alberta lakes are inhabited by huge northern pike and lake trout; pike, perch, and pickerel can be found in most Alberta lakes. In the Rocky Mountain lakes and streams are found Dolly Varden trout, rainbow trout, and grayling. The Bow River, which flows through Calgary, is one of the best rainbow trout streams in North America.\nCamping is popular in Alberta, and campsites are available in the three Rocky Mountain National Parks, as well as in 37 provincial parks. The national parks offer superb recreation throughout the year; entry permits, valid for a year, can be bought for a nominal fee.\nEntertainment\nCalgary has a philharmonic orchestra, a chamber music society, several choral groups, an amateur theater, an opera association, and a large number of movie houses. The permanent home of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra is the splendid new Calgary Centre for the Performing Arts. In addition, traveling orchestras, ballets, and musicals visit the city each year. The Glen-bow Museum houses displays of Eskimo and Indian artifacts, as well as exhibits on ranching, railroads, farming, oil, and the mounted police.\nCalgary's Chinatown is small compared to those in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal, but the restaurants on South Centre Street are lively late into the evening. There are very good Italian, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Mexican, and Vietnamese restaurants, and first-class French cuisine.\nCalgary has several public libraries. New works of fiction and nonfiction from Canadian, American, and British publishers are regularly added to the stacks. An almost complete array of U.S. magazines and pocketbooks can be found at most newsstands, department stores, and supermarkets.\nSocial contact between members of the American community is informal. The American Women's Club is a group of mainly longtime Calgary residents, many of whom are Canadian citizens.\nOther gatherings include both Canadians and Americans. Many opportunities exist for contributing voluntary time, skill, and effort to Canadian charitable and other activities. Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions Clubs are active in the city. Several ranking men's clubs are available downtown, including the Calgary Petroleum Club, the Ranchman's Club, and the 400 Club.\nHalifax\nHalifax is the center of economic, political, and military activity in the Atlantic provinces. The capital of the province of Nova Scotia and the largest, most important city in the Atlantic region, Halifax is located on the south coast of the Nova Scotia peninsula. The city itself is a tiny peninsula with one of the finest natural harbors in the world.\nHalifax was founded in 1749 by Edward Cornwallis as a British stronghold, and became the capital of Nova Scotia in place of Annapolis Royal the following year. It was incorporated as a city in 1842 and has been an important Canadian naval base since 1910.\nBeginning life as a fort, its situation was so ideal for trade that, during the early 19th century, Halifax was the wealthiest part of Canada. Today, Halifax is an interesting mix of old and new. Province House where the Nova Scotia legislature meets, is a fine example of Georgian architecture. The residence of the lieutenant governor is also a beautiful building with lovely period furniture. The Old Town Clock on Citadel Hill, ordered by the Duke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria, during his tenure as commander of the Halifax Garrison, has been the symbol of Halifax for many years, but is now challenged by the towers of encroaching high-rise office and apartment buildings.\nThe Halifax Container port, Halifax Shipyards Ltd., and HMC Dockyard (the largest naval base in Canada) are the most important waterfront industries. Although Halifax spent the first half of the 20th century tearing down its old buildings, it is spending the latter half restoring those which are left. A fine example of this change of heart is the Historic Properties waterfront development, which features warehouses, banks, and other buildings of historic value.\nThe population of metropolitan Halifax (including its twin city of Dartmouth and other contiguous communities) is estimated at 321,000 (2000). The decline in merchant shipping has adversely affected the local economy, as have the recent severe problems in the fishing industry, an important one in this area. Nova Scotia now bases its hopes for economic prosperity on the gas finds off Sable Island, just as Newfoundland has great expectations founded on offshore oil. Although the oil glut has dimmed these hopes for the moment, exploration is still going on. Dartmouth, until recently best known as the bedroom of Halifax, is doing better with related industry which supplies the drilling rigs. Unlike Halifax which, cramped into its small peninsula, literally has no place to go, Dartmouth is able to provide space for industry in its Burnside Industrial Park. Halifax International Airport is located in Kelly Lake, about a 20-minute drive from Dartmouth.\nHalifax is the Atlantic regional headquarters of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC); the federal departments of Manpower and Immigration; Northern and Indian Affairs; Public Works; and Transport. It is also the principal military, rescue, and emergency planning headquarters of eastern Canada. The main office of the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council is in Halifax, as are the regional headquarters of many banks and corporations.\nThe U.S. consular district was originally established in 1827 as the first consular office in British North America. Now, it covers four of Canada's 10 provinces—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. The first three are known as the Maritime Provinces; along with Newfoundland, they are known as the Atlantic Provinces.\nEducation\nEducational opportunities are excellent in Halifax, which is the center of the largest concentration of institutions of higher learning in Atlantic Canada, attracting students and teachers from many parts of the world. This contributes to the area's growing cosmopolitan atmosphere.\nWithin the corporate boundaries of the city are seven degree-granting institutions—Dalhousie University (founded in 1818), St. Mary's University (founded in 1841), King's College, Nova Scotia Technical College (founded in 1907), Mount St. Vincent University (founded in 1873), Atlantic School of Theology, and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Also available is the Nova Scotia Institute of Technology.\nSchool attendance is compulsory for all children ages six to 16. The language of instruction for most of Nova Scotia is English. The Halifax public schools are divided into elementary schools and junior and   senior high schools. Vocational and technical training is offered by the provincially operated vocational school.\nTuition is free for Halifax residents. No school bus transportation is provided; students either walk or rely on public transportation. French instruction is available on a voluntary basis at all levels, and one school offers a French immersion program in elementary grades. It is anticipated that the program will expand gradually to include upper grades as well.\nThe Catholic Church operates one private school in Halifax—the Convent School of the Sacred Heart. Tuition is charged. The school offers classes for girls through grade 12, and for boys in grades primary to six.\nAnother private school is the Armbrae Academy. It is coeducational and offers classes for grades primary through twelve.\nHalifax has a number of nursery schools, one popular school being the Halifax Early Childhood School, on Inglis Street.\nSpecial education opportunities in Halifax include facilities for the mentally handicapped and those with learning disabilities, grades primary through nine, and for the physically handicapped, grades primary through 12. In addition, educational facilities are available for the emotionally disturbed and those with behavioral difficulties in grades one through nine. Transportation, if required, is available, and in very special cases, teaching in the home is possible.\nA school for the blind (primary to 11th grade) is also located in Halifax. An effort is made to keep visually handicapped children within the regular school system, particularly at the high school level. A school for the deaf, serving New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia, is located in Amherst, Nova Scotia, about 125 miles from Halifax.\nRecreation\nSeveral beaches are on both the south and east shores within two hours' drive of Halifax. Sea bathing is for the hardy only, since the water temperature is rarely over 65°F. Freshwater swimming is available at Grand Lake outside Halifax and in the Dartmouth Lakes. Indoor pools are located at the YMCA, the YWCA, and Centennial Pool. The Halifax Dalplex and the Dartmouth Sportsplex offer swimming, skating, and gym facilities, as well as exercise classes. Skating and curling clubs are popular. Outdoor skating on the various lakes is limited because of the changeable climate.\nMost of the city's leading business and professional people belong to one of two yacht clubs, the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron or the Armdale Club, even if they do not own boats.\nThe area has four golf clubs: a public club, the Ashburn Golf and Country Club in Halifax (the largest); Brightwood in Dartmouth; and a private club, Oakfield Golf and Country Club, Ltd., outside the city.\nA majority of the tennis courts are controlled by the tennis clubs and universities. Among the clubs with tennis courts are the South End Tennis Club, the Waegwoltic Club, St. Mary's Boat Club, and the  Northwest Arm Rowing Club. Indoor tennis is available at the Burnside Tennis Club in Dartmouth. Public tennis courts are located on the Halifax Common and at other parks throughout the city. Other court games available (at private clubs) are squash, handball, and badminton.\nPersons who have some skill in football, basketball, or hockey can join amateur leagues or club teams. Health-building programs and gym facilities are available at the local YMCA, YWCA, and at various health clubs. Nova Scotians are also interested in skating and curling. Many people join skating clubs. The ancient Scottish game of curling is entirely a club activity, and membership in either of two curling organizations is an easy way to get to know the Haligonians.\nWentworth, about 90 miles north of Halifax, and Mount Martoc near Windsor have limited skiing.\nHalifax is far from the larger Canadian and U.S. cities, but is well situated for excursions within the Maritimes. Its coastal scenery is beautiful, and the provinces contain many places of interest, with sailing, sunbathing, hunting, and fishing as the chief attractions. These points are not resort towns in the usual sense, so a car is useful. Bus transportation is available; railway travel is slow, except on the main line.\nTwo main highway routes connect most points of interest. One leads from Halifax to Yarmouth, on the southwestern end of the province, close to the famous tuna fishing grounds, then northeast along the Bay of Fundy through the apple-growing belt of the Annapolis Valley and Evangeline country. The Evangeline trail covers the country first colonized by the French. The oldest permanent settlement in North America was at Port Royal, and the French Habitation built there in 1605 has been reconstructed.\nThe other route leads northeast from Halifax, across the Strait of Canso and around the scenically magnificent Cabot Trail to Sydney, a city of about 35,000 and Cape Breton's steel center. Cape Breton Island, with its Cabot Trail, Louisbourg Fortress, and the Alexander Graham Bell Museum at Baddeck, is a very popular tourist attraction.\nHubbards, Chester, Mahone Bay, and Lunenburg, all with less than 5,000 population, lie along the Atlantic Coast, some 20 to 100 miles southwest of Halifax. These towns have comfortable accommodations for visitors in the tourist season, as do most Nova Scotian towns. Peggy's Cove and colorful fishing villages lie along the bays of the south coast.\nNova Scotia's 4,500 lakes, 50 rivers, and numerous streams offer fantastic fishing—shad, brook trout and, especially, Atlantic salmon. Some of the best smoked salmon can be found in the small Nova Scotian town of Tangier.\nIn New Brunswick, Fundy National Park, maintained by the federal government, features camping facilities, hiking, boating, horseback riding, nature trails, and many other worthwhile recreational activities. New Brunswick also has a number of festivals related to the area's fishing industry, including the Shediac Lobster Festival and the Campbellton Salmon Festival. Not far away is the former summer home of President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Campobello Island, now maintained jointly by the U.S. and Canada. The picturesque resort town of St. Andrews-by-the-Sea, with its white frame houses, reminds the visitor of the U.S. New England states.\nPrince Edward Island (P.E.I.), the garden province, is alive with activity in the summertime, with its many museums, beaches, parks, and theaters. Music camps and the Atlantic Canada Institute Summer School are held in July at the University of P.E.I. Country Days and Old Home Week feature music, agricultural displays, handicrafts, and parades. The Anne of Green Gables Festival, along with lobster, strawberry, and potato blossom festivals and craft fairs, are also part of its summer attractions. P.E.I. is a favorite vacation spot for young families.\nNewfoundland offers many opportunities for camping, hunting, fishing, and sight-seeing. Its capital, St. John's, is a good base from which to explore the province's scenic and historic Avalon Peninsula.\nYear-round ferry service to Port Aux Basques on Newfoundland's southwest coast is offered from North Sydney, Nova Scotia. Many summertime visitors to Newfoundland, however, prefer to take the ferry which operates during summer months from North Sydney to Argentia, Newfoundland, an Avalon Peninsula port (in Placentia Bay near the site where Roosevelt and Churchill drafted the Atlantic Charter), only 85 miles from St. John's. Newfoundland's annual regatta is one of the oldest sporting events in North America.\nAir service is provided by Air Canada and Eastern Provincial Airways to numerous cities in the Atlantic Provinces. Two ferry services connect Nova Scotia with Prince Edward Island at two points: one, operating throughout the year, crosses from Cape Tormentine in New Brunswick to Port Borden, about 35 miles to the west of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island; the other, which operates only when there is no ice, crosses from Pictou, Nova Scotia, to Woods Island, about 35 miles southeast of Charlottetown.\nEntertainment\nHalifax has a professional repertory theater, The Neptune, and is the home of Symphony Nova Scotia, a professional orchestra, recently formed under the musical direction of Boris Brott, a well-known and talented Canadian conductor. The orchestra performs chamber music as well as symphonic programs. Rebecca Cohn Auditorium, located  at Dalhousie University, is the locale for various kinds of entertainment, including concerts by such well-known Canadians as André Gagnon and Liona Boyd. An ensemble called Nova Music performs classical music by contemporary composers. Distinguished films are shown in the auditorium on Sunday nights.\nDalhousie University, St. Mary's University, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) sponsor concert series throughout the season which feature international and national artists.

Books are available at local bookstores, but cost 20% more than in the U.S.\nArt exhibits are held at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and at various universities.\nSome excellent restaurants are located in Halifax, specializing in seafood delicacies and French cuisine.\nWinnipeg\nMetropolitan Winnipeg is the fifth largest city in Canada, ranking after Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary. It is known worldwide for its seemingly endless wheat fields, its blizzards, and its hockey team, the Jets.\nA fur trading post was established on the site of modern-day Winnipeg in 1738, and later a colony was founded by the Scots. The village of Winnipeg was settled in the late 1860s, and incorporated as a city in 1873.\nWinnipeg resembles cities of comparable size in the middle western plains in the U.S. Situated on the eastern edge of an 800-mile stretch of prairie-land, it is the home of the Canadian Wheat Board and the Board of Grain Commissioners. Winnipeg is also located almost midway between the two oceans, near the geographical center of North America. Its people are friendly and hospitable. Their interests, habits, and mode of life are similar to those of the American Westerner.\nThe capital of the Province of Manitoba, Winnipeg is situated at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, about 70 miles north of the international boundary. It is 485 miles, by car, from Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is 760 feet above sea level, and the surrounding area within a 100-mile perimeter is flat, broken by occasional wooded areas and streams. The area has a healthy climate, comparable to that of Minneapolis, although colder. Winter temperatures drop to as low as 40°F or more below zero. Winters are fairly dry and summers are cool and pleasant.\nGreater Winnipeg's population was about 652,400 in 2000. English is the principal language spoken in the city. However, in St. Boniface, a part of metropolitan Winnipeg, more than 40% of the present population is of French or Belgian ancestry, and most people speak French as well as English.\nAlthough about 40% of Winnipeg's population is British in origin, with a strong Scottish strain, there are a number of other nationalities, including Ukrainians, Germans, French, Italians, Dutch, Philippines, Vietnamese, and Chinese. There is no American colony as such in Winnipeg. In fact, the social, economic, and cultural background of the city is practically the same as in the contiguous areas of the U.S. There is a constant shift of population in both directions across the border, and estimates place the number of persons in the district with claim to U.S. citizenship above 10,000. Upwards of one-and-a-half million American tourists have annually visited the Province of Manitoba.\nEducation\nWinnipeg's good, free education for kindergarten through grade 12 is comparable to American standards. Two nondenominational private schools and two Roman Catholic schools are also of good reputation. The nondenominational school for girls, Balmoral High School, has classes from kindergarten through grade 12. The Roman Catholic school, St. Mary's Academy for Girls, provides facilities for grades seven through 12. St. John's Raven-scourt School for Boys (and girls from grades nine through 12) provides excellent education from grades one through 12. St. Paul's College (Roman Catholic) provides education for boys and young men (grades nine through 11 and through university). Tuition and annual fees at private schools are slightly lower than those in the U.S.\nSpecial educational opportunities are available in each school division in Winnipeg for children who have learning disabilities or who are mentally or physically handicapped. Special educational institutions are also available for severely physically  handicapped or mentally retarded children.\nWinnipeg has two universities. The University of Manitoba, is the oldest university in Western Canada. Founded in 1877, it is a first-class provincially operated institution and offers a large number of undergraduate and graduate programs. The University of Winnipeg, located in the center of the city, is a relatively new institution (founded in 1967), with undergraduate courses in the liberal arts and pre-professional education.\nRed River Community College specializes in practical courses for both degree and nondegree students. All three institutions have evening and summer sessions.\nVarious levels of instruction are offered at the Winnipeg School of Ballet. Students taking private lessons in music may take examinations leading to the certificate of Associate of the Toronto Conservatory of Music. The University of Manitoba gives a bachelor's degree (AMM) in music. The Winnipeg Art Gallery also offers art classes.\nRecreation\nWinnipeg offers numerous and varied year-round recreational facilities for adults as well as children. Nearly every residential neighborhood has school playgrounds and local community clubs where instruction is given to children in handicrafts, dancing, skating, hockey, football, tennis, and other sports. Four large and some small parks, the largest of which is Assiniboine Park (which has a fine zoo, formal gardens, and conservatory), provide pleasant surroundings for picnicking, sports, and walking. All parks are conveniently served by local transportation.\nGolf, tennis, swimming, and boating are the most popular summer sports in Winnipeg. Golf may be played at several very good municipal courses or at a number of semiprivate clubs where reasonable greens fees are charged. Winnipeg has a number of neighborhood wading pools, one large municipal outdoor pool, and several indoor pools. An Olympic-size indoor pool, one of the largest in the world and the site of the 1967 Pan American Games' swimming events, is located in the city.\nSeveral local skiing clubs teach the fundamentals of skiing and jumping on the banks of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, but it is necessary to travel some distance from the city for really good downhill skiing conditions. Cross-country skiing is popular in and around Winnipeg. Indoor sports such as badminton, squash, bowling, curling, and roller skating may also be enjoyed.\nExcellent hunting abounds in Manitoba. Deer, moose, and even polar bear are found in the north. Duck, geese, prairie chicken, and grouse are found only a few hours' drive from Winnipeg in some of the best hunting regions in Canada. Good fishing can be found throughout the district, and both open water and ice fishing are very popular.\nThe Precambrian Shield, 50 miles east of the city, is an area of woods, rocks, and lakes. The nearest resort area is the district on the southern shores of Lake Winnipeg, about 35 miles to the north by road, where many people have small cottages. There are limited bathing facilities in several of the beach towns.\nThe western section of the very attractive Lake of the Woods area is about 120 miles east of Winnipeg and easily accessible by car, bus, or train. Among the pleasant resorts closest to Winnipeg are Kenora, Whiteshell Forest Reserve and, to the west, Riding Mountain National Park. Many attractive summer homes are found throughout the area. Hotel accommodations are good; motels are satisfactory. Most resort spots offer special camping facilities.\nTo the north, places such as Flin Flon, a copper-zinc-gold mining center, and Fort Churchill on Hudson Bay are interesting places to visit. There is a good paved road to Flin Flon (560 miles) and to Thompson (a nickel mining town), but Fort Churchill is reached only by rail or air. Each year a few rail excursions of several days' duration are run to Churchill, with the tourists living on the train. The Selkirk Navigation Company operates a five-day cruise on Lake Winnipeg during June, July, August, and September. Accommodations on the modern Lord Selkirk are comfortable.\nNorthwest of Winnipeg, at the south end of Lake Dauphin, is the town of Dauphin (population 9,000). Known for barley, timber, and fisheries, Dauphin is also host to Canada's National Ukrainian Festival, held annually in August.\nEntertainment\nWinnipeg prides itself as being \"The Convention City\" and, as might be expected, it offers a wide variety of entertainment opportunities. These include the internationally renowned Royal Winnipeg Ballet, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Manitoba Theater Center, the Contemporary Dancers, and the Opera. Performances are usually held in the Concert Hall and the Manitoba Theater Center, both located at the Centennial Center adjacent to City Hall. There is also an open-air theater—Rainbow Stage—where plays, musicals, and other attractions are held during the summer.\nAlso in the Centennial Center is the Museum of Man and Nature, which offers a wide variety of exhibits on the general theme of man in relation to the environment. There are several other museums in the city, the most impressive of which is the new and strikingly handsome Winnipeg Art Gallery.\nThe city's ethnic diversity is reflected in the variety of festivals held throughout the year, including Festival du Voyageur (a winter festival in St. Boniface), Ukrainian Week, and Folklorama, a major event each summer, during which pavilions representing various ethnic groups provide entertainment in the form of traditional songs, dancing, and food.\nProbably the most popular attraction in the city is hockey, with its National Hockey League franchise, the Jets. The Winnipeg Arena is located on Maroons Road, named after a senior hockey team which brought honor to the city 20 years ago. When the Jets joined the NHL, the roof of Winnipeg Arena was raised and 5,400 additional seats were installed. This brought the arena up to NHL standards of at least 15,000 seats.\nOther spectator sports include football and curling games, as well as thoroughbred racing at Assiniboine Downs.\nThere are about 15 motion picture theaters in the city. Several of these are first class and feature the latest American and, on occasion, European films. Winnipeg also has a 200,000-volume, Carnegie-endowed public library located in a new, attractive building.\nWeather dictates the nature of much of the activity: concerts, theater, ballet, bridge, and winter sports when it is cold; and fishing, touring tennis, golf, cycling, and walking when the glorious spring and summer weather arrives.\nHamilton\nHamilton, on the western tip of Lake Ontario, is about 40 miles southwest of Toronto. Explored by Robert LaSalle in 1669 and first settled in 1813, it is Canada's most important steel-producing center, and also is a transportation hub with a harbor, an airport, and a rail terminus. Other industries include the manufacture of automobiles, tires, railroad equipment, clothing, chemicals, and farm implements. The metropolitan population is approximately 599,800 (2000 est.).\nHamilton has many attractions for the visitor. Its 1,900-acre Royal Botanical Gardens are among the most beautiful on the North American continent. There are also gardens in Gage Park, and formal gardens close to the Art Gallery of Hamilton. The city is home to Canada's largest open-air market, which teems with residents and visitors during the growing season. Hamilton Beach on Lake Ontario is a summer playground.\nOne of the major tourist sites in the city is the 72-room Dundurn Castle, which houses a museum and a children's theater. It was built by Sir Allan Napier MacNab from 1832 to 1835 and bought by the city in 1900. MacNab was prime minister of the United Province of Upper and Lower Canada from 1854-1856.\nThe Hamilton Visitors and Convention Bureau is located at 155 James Street South.\nRegina\nRegina is the capital city of Saskatchewan, Canada's fifth largest province. Founded in 1822, it was the capital of the Northwest Territories from its inception until 1905 and, that year, when Saskatchewan was designated as a separate province, it became the seat of provincial government. It is called by Canadians the \"Queen City of the Plains.\"\nRegina is a transportation and commercial center in the midst of a large farming region. It is the site of Campion College (founded in 1917), the Canadian Bible College (founded in 1941), the Regina branch of the University of Saskatchewan, and Luther College (founded in 1921). Among its points of interest are the Museum of Natural History, the Regina Plains Museum, the Telecommunications Historical Museum, the Saskatchewan Archives, and MacKenzie Art Gallery, with its extensive collection of Canadian and European art and antiquities from the ancient world. Sports enthusiasts can spend a day amidst memorabilia and artifacts at the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame and Sport Museum. Its population is approximately 192,800.\nRegina was named by Princess Louise of Great Britain in honor of her mother, Queen Victoria. It was the headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police until 1920. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Centennial Museum contains buffalo coats, guns, saddles, uniforms, and photographs illustrating the legendary police force's intriguing past.\nRegina hosts a number of major events each year: the Western Canada Farm Progress Show in June, Buffalo Days in July, the International Arabian Horse Show in August, and the Canadian Western Agribition each November.\nThe city has a rich cultural tradition as evidenced by its many theater, dance, music and ethnic performing groups and by the Saskatchewan Center of the Arts, one of the finest concert halls in North America. The Regina Symphony is the oldest continuously operating symphony orchestra in Canada.\nThe city operates a number of excellent parks and complexes, the Regina Sportplex, five outdoor swimming pools and several excellent golf courses. Wascana Centre, located in the heart of the city, has a man-made lake, bicycle paths, paddle-boat rentals, a waterfowl park, double-decker bus tours, and several historic points of interest.\nJust north of Regina, in the small town of Craven, the largest outdoor country music extravaganza in Canada is held annually in July. The Big Valley Jamboree features many U.S. country music performers.\nSaskatchewan's rich Indian heritage can be explored at the summer powwows held on most Indian reserves. Major ceremonies include the Poundmaker Powwow near Cut-knife, and the Standing Buffalo Indian Powwow at Sioux Bridge near Fort Qu'Appelle.\nEdmonton\nEdmonton, Alberta's capital, is Canada's \"Gateway to the North,\" known for its excellent quality of life. It boasts a population of 940,000 and is the oil capital of the  country. In addition to oil, Edmonton's major industries include flour milling, meat-packing, plastics, tanning, dairying, lumbering, and petrochemical production. Established in 1795 as a Hudson's Bay trading post, it expanded and developed during the gold rush to the Klondike in 1898. The quiet town of 1,500 settlers became the supply center for miners drawn by the promise of gold. It is now a modern city with a new international airport. The city's numerous rail lines have contributed to Edmonton's reputation as the transportation hub of northwestern Canada.\nLocated 350 miles north of the U.S. border, Edmonton is the northern-most major city in Canada. Just 185 miles from the center of Alberta, Edmonton is surrounded by a rare natural setting. Verdant foothills banked with wood and the mighty North Saskatchewan River soften the effect of all the city's new concrete. Along the river runs an impressive 35 miles of greenbelt.\nThe University of Alberta (founded in 1906) is located in the city, as are St. Joseph's College (founded in 1927), the Christian Training Institute, and other specialized schools.\nFootball and curling are popular spectator and participant recreational activities, but of greatest interest is Edmonton's National Hockey League team, the two-time Stanley Cup champion (1984 and 1985) Oilers.\nAttractions in Edmonton range from various types of theater, particularly at the Citadel, to galleries and the domed Provincial Legislature buildings. Several rodeos are held during the summer months. In July, when the sun hardly sets, Edmonton hosts Klondike Days. The city's frontier past and gold rush days are celebrated at that time with sourdough raft races, beard growing contests, and other events. In August, the city hosts a Folk Music Festival. This festival features traditional and bluegrass music, country, blues, and Celtic music, arts and crafts displays, and a food fair.\nPerhaps the biggest attraction in Edmonton is West Edmonton Mall, located seven miles from downtown.

It is an industrial and railroad center, first settled in 1826, on the Thames River, about 20 miles north of Lake Erie. Much of its architecture and atmosphere is suggestive of the more famous city on another Thames, and visitors find that the Ontario London has many characteristics reminiscent of England's capital. London is surrounded by a rich agricultural area. Vegetables, fruits, grain, and dairy products are produced in this region. Several products are manufactured in London, including brass and steel products, textiles, diesel locomotives, food products, clothing, and electrical appliances.\nLondon is well known for its art museum and for its Museum of Indian Archaeology and Pioneer Life, housed at the University of Western Ontario.

Located on the southeast coast of the province, on the Atlantic Ocean, St. John's is the commercial center and principal port of Newfoundland. With a metropolitan population of about 173,000 the city has an excellent natural harbor and is the terminus of the railroad which crosses the island.\nThe area was colonized by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1593, and Water Street bustled in 1600, making it the continent's oldest business district, but a permanent settlement was not established until early in the 17th century. Twice destroyed by the French and Indians, St. John's was permanently controlled by the British beginning in 1762. It served as a naval base during the American Revolution and the War of 1812. On Signal Hill in 1901, Marconi received the first trans-Atlantic wireless message. The first nonstop, trans-Atlantic flight was made from St. John's in 1919.\nAs a base for the province's fishing fleet, St. John's industries are mainly related to fishing, and include shipbuilding, manufacturing fishing equipment and marine engines, and the storing, preserving, and processing of fish. St. John's has Roman Catholic and Anglican cathedrals, and is the site of the Newfoundland Museum, Memorial University (founded in 1949), and Queen's College (founded in 1841).\nSt. John's has many fine parks throughout the city.

The 2000 population of the metropolitan area was estimated at 287,900.\nVictoria is the largest city on the island, as well as its major port and business center. Industries in the city include sawmills, woodworking plants, grain elevators, and fish processing factories. Victoria is also the base for a deep-sea fishing fleet and the Pacific headquarters of the Canadian Navy.\nThe city was founded in 1843 as Fort Camosun, a Hudson's Bay Company post. It was later named Fort Victoria. When Vancouver Island became a crown colony in 1849, its new town (built in l851-52) was called Victoria and named the capital of the colony. In the late 1850s, gold was discovered in British Columbia and Victoria became an important base for miners on their way to the Cariboo gold fields. The island was united with the mainland in 1866, and Victoria remained the capital. In 1871, it became the capital of the province.\nVictoria, with its mild climate, beautiful gardens, and many parks is a popular center for American and Canadian tourists. The city's most famous garden is Butchard Gardens, which dates back to 1904. Other beautiful gardens worth visiting include those at Government House and Beacon Hill Park.

The Ambassador Bridge and the busy Detroit-Windsor river tunnel, which connect the two countries, carry countless commuters to their jobs in both cities, and serve the thousands of tourists who casually shop and dine and attend theaters and recreational activities in Detroit and Windsor.\nA two-week-long International Freedom Festival is held jointly with Detroit in late June and early July, celebrating both the Canadian and the U.S. independence. The highlight of the festival is a huge fireworks display over the Detroit River. Windsor's riverfront is lined with parks. Jackson Park and Dieppe Gardens are the pride of the city.\nWith an estimated 2000 population of 262,000, Windsor has grown into a modern business and industrial center in the years since its incorporation as a village in 1854, then as a city in 1892.\nWindsor was settled by the French at about the turn of the 18th century, just after the foundation of Detroit in 1701.

It was named for Queen Charlotte, consort of George III. It is on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, near Prince Edward Island National Park.\nHistoric DAWSON (formerly called Dawson City) lies at the confluence of the Yukon and Klondike Rivers in western Yukon Territory. A town of only 1,790, Dawson in its heyday of the Klondike Gold Rush (late 1890s) boasted over 30,000 residents. The rapid exhaustion of accessible mines in the early 20th century dealt the community a serious blow. The town's status as administrative center of the territory was lost in 1953. Now a major tourist and distribution area, Dawson celebrates its past with annual Discovery Day celebrations in August. The cabins of writers Jack London and Robert W. Service have been restored.

Fort Frontenac was built here by the French in 1673 and was destroyed by the Iroquois Indians shortly thereafter. Restored in 1695, the fort became a key point in reaching the Upper St. Lawrence River. The present city of Kingston, or \"king's town,\" was settled by Loyalist refugees in 1793. In the early 1800s, the city seemed a likely target for an American invasion, so Fort Henry was built to guard the royal dockyards; it was used as a base for the British naval forces on Lake Ontario during the War of 1812. Fort Henry is currently a military museum. Kingston served as the capital of Canada from 1841 through 1844. Today, the city is an important transshipment point for the Welland Ship Canal and an outlet for traffic on the Rideau Canal.

The city is a departure point for boat tours along the Rideau Canal to Ottawa and around the scenic Thousand Islands. Kingston was the birthplace of organized hockey and the first league game was played here in 1885. The International Hockey Hall of Fame museum depicts the development of the sport through displays of equipment, photographs, and mementos.\nKITCHENER , an industrial city in southeastern Ontario, is about 60 miles southwest of Toronto. Largely settled by the Pennsylvania Dutch in 1806, the area was then settled by Germans in 1825. The Germans named the city Berlin, but it was renamed in honor of Lord Horatio Kitchener, a British statesman. Kitchener honors its German heritage with an Oktoberfest, North America's largest. The city has a population of 178,000 (1996 est.); its metropolitan area, which includes the adjoining city of Waterloo, has a population of 346,000 (1990 est.). Manufactured items include furniture, textiles, shoes, appliances, and rubber products; industries include distilling, brewing, tanning, and meat packing. Kitchener is the site of St. Jerome's College, founded in 1864, and of Woodside National Historic Park, which commemorates the birthplace of William Lyon Mackenzie King, a Canadian statesman and former prime minister.\nMEDICINE HAT , Alberta, lies on the South Saskatchewan River, 180 miles southeast of Calgary. This city of 40,000 is located in the heart of one of the biggest natural gas fields in the world. It is also on the Trans-Canada Highway and Canadian Pacific Railway. Medicine Hat is the home of several industries, among them pottery manufacturing, glassblowing, and flour milling. The mostly agricultural economy is dominated by ranching and vegetable growing. According to Indian legend, Medicine Hat acquired its name from a frightened Cree medicine man who lost his hat escaping from warriors. The city hosts an annual stampede and exhibition and has a highly regarded historical museum.\nNIAGARA FALLS , with an estimated population of 70,500, is the site of one of the world's great natural wonders, drawing tourists from all over the world. The city itself is a manufacturing center located just below the falls in southeastern Ontario, opposite Niagara Falls, New York, to which it is connected by two bridges. Founded in 1853, the city was known as Clifton from 1856-1881, and was incorporated in 1904. The center of a large hydro-electric power complex, Niagara Falls also produces fertilizer, chemicals, abrasives, cereal, paper goods, silverware, and sporting goods. It is best known, however, as a bustling tourist town with several man-made attractions. A 25-mile park system stretches from above the falls downriver to Niagara-on-the-Lake. The falls are equally spectacular in the summer and in the winter when frozen; an illumination system also makes them a spectacular nighttime attraction.\nSituated in a beautiful setting on Lake Ontario at the mouth of the Niagara River, NIAGARAON-THE-LAKE is one of the prettiest and best-preserved 19th-century towns in North America. Founded in 1780 and originally named Newark, Niagara-on-the-Lake was the first capital of Upper Canada from 1791-1796. Although the town was burned in 1813, parts of Fort Massassauga are still visible. Today, the city is best known for the Shaw Festival, a major annual theater event featuring the plays of George Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries. Performed in the Royal George Theatre, the Court House Theatre, and the modern Festival Theatre, the festival runs from early May through September. Located opposite Fort Niagara, New York, Niagara-on-the-Lake has a current population of 12,200.\nSituated on the northeast shore of Lake Nipissing in northern Ontario, NORTH BAY is a busy year-round tourist city, well known to fishermen and hunters. It has a \"golden mile\" sandy beach with picnic facilities and shore-land parks, as well as numerous hiking trails. A transportation hub, North Bay produces lumber, dairy products, fur products, mining machinery and brass fittings; there are dairy farms in the area. The city is also home of the Quints Museum; the original Dionne family log farmhouse has been restored and now houses memorabilia from the world's first  recorded surviving quintuplets. The annual Festival of the Arts, a series of cultural, musical, and social activities, is held in late September and early October. The local French community organizes sports and social events in early February for the Bon Homme Winter Carnival. North Bay's current population is 51,300.\nOAKVILLE , located on Lake Ontario 22 miles southwest of Toronto, is a wealthy community of approximately 128,400 with an attractive harbor and an enduring, 19th-century charm. Automobiles, plastics, aluminum ware, and paper are produced in Oakville. The city is also a summer resort and has a golf course—Glen Abbey—designed by American pro golfer, Jack Nicklaus.\nOSHAWA , situated on Lake Ontario 33 miles northeast of Toronto, is one of the main centers of Canada's automobile industry. Founded in 1795 as a lake port, Oshawa was incorporated as a town in 1879 and as a city in 1924. There are several old buildings near the lake-front that are preserved as part of the city's past. As an industrial city, Oshawa produces motor vehicles and parts, foundry products, electrical appliances, metal stampings, glass, plastics, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and furniture. The Canadian headquarters of General Motors is located here. The Canadian Automotive Museum, which displays collections from Canada's early car industry, is also located in Oshawa. The city's population is roughly 134,000.\nPETERBOROUGH , a bustling city with many reminders of the past, is located in southeastern Ontario on the Otonabee River and Trent Canal, 13 miles north of the west end of Rice Lake and 70 miles northeast of Toronto. Sawmills were established on this site in 1821; the city was founded four years later and incorporated in 1905. Today, Peterborough is an industrial city whose products include electrical machinery, marine hardware, boats, plastics, lumber, carpets, and watches. Dairy farms are also located in the area. In addition, Peterborough is the southeastern gateway to the Kawartha Lakes and is the major link in the Trent-Severn Waterway. The Hydraulic Lift Lock is the world's highest hydraulic lift and the symbol of the city. It literally lifts pleasure craft, along with the water in which they float, 65 feet straight up. There is constant traffic, especially on summer weekends; during winter, there is skating on the canal beneath the lift lock. Peterborough also boasts the highest jet fountain in Canada. The Centennial Fountain shoots water 250 feet up from Little Lake, just south of the city. Trent University was founded here in 1963. The population is roughly 62,500. Southeast of Peterborough is the industrial town of Belleville, located on the Bay of Quinte. With a population of 35,300, Belleville is the gateway to two great recreation regions—the Highlands of Hastings, with its clear lakes (Bancroft is a tourist center there), and the sandy beaches of Quinte's Isle to the south (Picton attracts tourists there). A popular vacation spot, Belleville has one of Ontario's finest yacht harbors, along with facilities for golf, fishing, and swimming. Southwest of Belleville, on the eastern terminus of the Trent Canal system, is Trenton, whose population is 15,100. A popular water-oriented city, Trenton offers sailing, swimming, and fishing in summer, and ice boating and ice fishing in winter.\nSituated in south-central Saskatchewan, PRINCE ALBERT is an important distribution point for the northern reaches of the province. Its varied economic base includes oil refining, woodworking, paper milling, tanning, and food packaging. Tourism here centers on nearby Prince Albert National Park and the unique Lund Wildlife Exhibit. Visitors are often attracted to Prince Albert's numerous museums and art galleries. Outdoor enthusiasts also enjoy the area's excellent hiking and skiing trails, and beautiful lakes where fishing is abundant. The metropolitan area is the site of a federal penitentiary, a school for the retarded, and several Indian reservations. Prince Albert has a population of about 34,000.\nSituated in central British Columbia, 485 miles north of Vancouver, PRINCE GEORGE serves as an important provincial administrative and transportation hub. Explorer Simon Fraser founded the city in the early 1800s as a trading post on the river that now bears his name. The city grew with the opening of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1913. The community's approximately 66,000 residents rely heavily on the lumber industry, as well as on minerals, oil, and hydropower, for their livelihoods. Tourists and sportsmen know Prince George as a base for expeditions into the Cariboo district.\nSAINT CATHERINES , \"the Garden City,\" is an industrial city situated on the Welland Ship Canal, just south of Lake Ontario. Settled by the Loyalists in 1790, Saint Catherines was incorporated as a town in 1845 and as a city in 1876. It was once a depot of the Underground Railroad; was the site of the first Welland Canal, built in 1829; and had the first electric streetcar system in North America. Today, Saint Catherines produces automobile parts, machinery, electrical equipment, hardware, textiles, and hosiery. Fruit is packed and shipped from its harbor. Brock University, founded in 1962, was named for (Gen.) Sir Isaac Brock, who commanded the Canadian and British forces at the battle of Queenston Heights in 1812. The Niagara Grape and Wine Festival, marking the ripening of the grapes in the Saint Catherines area, is held annually in late September. The 10-day festival, begun in 1952 as a one-day observance, now includes more than 200 events. The population of Saint Catherines is approximately 124,000.\nSAINT JOHN , New Brunswick's largest city, boasts an excellent harbor, large dry docks, and terminal facilities. It is a year-round port with shipping connections to Europe, North and South America, and the West Indies. The city is the  commercial, manufacturing, and transportation center of the province. The city's major industries include brewing, tanning, fish processing, shipbuilding, and oil refining. Visited in 1604 by French explorer Samuel de Champlain, Saint John eventually became a French fort and trading post (1631), and in the ensuing years was captured and recaptured as England and France struggled for possession. Saint John is famed for its museums; its buildings dating to colonial times; and for the Reversing Falls, which are actually rapids caused by the famous high tides. Not far away is the former summer home of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Campobello Island, now maintained jointly by Canada and the U.S. Historical attractions include the Carleton Martello Tower, a stone fortification surviving from the War of 1812; the Fort Howe Blockhouse, a replica of a 1777 blockhouse. Visitors are afforded a panoramic view of the city from the fort. Many of St. John's homes and buildings are worthy examples of historic architecture. The population of Saint John is about 102,000.\nSARNIA is the center of Ontario's oil refining and petrochemical industries. Located on the Saint Clair River in southeastern Ontario, at the south end of Lake Huron, Sarnia is connected to Port Huron, Michigan, via the Bluewater Bridge, as well as by a railway tunnel. An important lake port, Sarnia produces lumber, plastics, sailboats, and automobile parts. Settled by the French in 1807 and by the English in 1813, Sarnia's waterfront offers a variety of recreational activities, including swimming, boating, and golfing. There are more than a dozen fully equipped marinas along 42 miles of white, sandy beaches. One of Sarnia's main attractions is fishing—trout, perch, whitefish, pickerel, walleye, chinook, and coho salmon may be caught from shore or boat. Water pollution problems have, occasionally, been serious. Those concerned about swimming in this region or eating locally caught fish are advised to contact appropriate provincial agencies. Known as the \"Salmon Capital of Ontario,\" the city is host to the annual Sarnia Salmon Derby in May. Thousands of sailors and spectators descend upon the city for the Port Huron-to-Mackinac Race each summer. The population is estimated at about 80,000.\nSASKATOON , in Saskatchewan, is the potash capital of the world. Half of the world's potash reserve is located in this area. Industries located in Saskatoon include food and dairy processing, flour milling, brewing, tanning, oil refining, and meat-packing. The city also manufactures electronic equipment fertilizers, clothing, and chemicals. Saskatoon is the home of the Mendel Art Gallery, which houses a collection of works by Canadian artists. Other museums in Saskatoon include the Ukrainian Museum of Canada, which has contemporary and historical exhibits dealing with the early settlement of Saskatchewan and culture on the Ukrainian people, and the Western Development Museum, which features a \"Boom Town\" that recreates a 1910 village. Saskatoon also hosts several annual fairs, and festivals which attract tourists and natives alike. The city offers numerous opportunities for fine dining. The population is about 194,000; the city is the birthplace of hockey great Gordie Howe.\nSAULT SAINTE MARIE was established on the site of a mission founded by Pere Jacques Marquette in 1668. It is situated at the falls on the St. Mary's River (the link between Lakes Huron and Superior), just opposite Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan. This is the site of one of the most active canals in the St. Lawrence Seaway system; lake freighters traveling to and from the upper Great Lakes use the locks to bypass the rapids. Tours of the locks are available. Two-hour cruises through both the American and Canadian locks, the world's busiest, are offered from late May until Thanksgiving. The Canadian lock, located at the edge of the St. Mary's River rapids, was completed in 1895 and is the oldest in the system. A pretty city with many old stone and brick buildings, Sault Sainte Marie's economy depends upon the Algoma steel plant, lumber, agriculture, and tourism. Although the city is considered part of the summer resort system, it also has many wintertime events. World class cross-country skiing trails are numerous and the downhill skiing is excellent. Groomed trails for snowmobiling are available. The Ontario Winter Carnival Bon Soo, featuring dog sled races, speed skating, polar bear swimming, and more is held here in late January/early February. To the east of Sault Sainte Marie, on the North Channel of Lake Huron, are several resort and vacation centers. Bruce Mines was named for Canada's first successful copper mines. Thessalon, a lumber town situated at the river mouth, has a large government wharf and marina. Iron Bridge, on the historic Mississagi River, is known for its sturgeon fishing. Blind River is a mining and lumbering center. A short distance inland is Elliot Lake, founded in 1954 when uranium deposits were discovered nearby. A modern town of 20,000 on the shore of one of the 170 lakes in the area, Elliot Lake offers winter and summer sports activities.\nSTRATFORD , Ontario, is located just north of London on the Avon River. Founded in 1832, the city produces furniture, brass, and leather and rubber goods. It is best known, however, for its deliberate resemblance to Stratford-upon-Avon, England, the home of William Shakespeare. The Stratford Shakespearean Festival in Ontario began modestly in 1953 and has since become a major world theatrical event, utilizing three theaters. While still based on a Shakespearean season, the festival now incorporates diverse forms of music and theater, from folk-singing to opera. The season runs from June through October. Stratford's population is over 27,000.\n\"The nickel capital of the world,\" SUDBURY is 40 miles north of  Georgian Bay in south-central Ontario. The city has a population of roughly over 90,000, and is in the middle of the country's most important mining region. Minerals were first discovered here in 1883; today, in addition to nickel, copper, gold, cobalt, sulfur, iron ore, silver, and platinum are mined. Industries include lumber milling, woodworking, brickworking, and machine shops. Sudbury is linked to other cities by the Trans-Canada Highway, as well as by two transcontinental railways. It acts as the area's main commercial and educational center.\nTHE FORD MINES is a mining community of 20,000, 50 miles south of Quebec City in southern Quebec province. It is known as one of the world's major asbestos-producing regions, but also mines chromium and feldspar (a crystalline mineral). Dairying, chromium and feldspar mining, saw milling, and fiberglass manufacturing are other commercial activities in Thetford Mines. It was founded in 1876 and became a city in 1912.\nTHOMPSON lies on the Burntwood River, 400 miles north of Winnipeg, in north-central Manitoba. This planned community was built in the late 1950s and has an estimated population of 14,700. The International Nickel Company is the principal employer. Its chairman, John Thompson, gave his name for the city when it was completed in 1961. The company's combination nickel mining-smelting-refining plant was the first of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. Thompson is linked to Winnipeg by air.\nTHUNDER BAY is Canada's third largest port, and the western terminus of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The twin cities of Port Arthur and Fort William joined to form Thunder Bay on January 1, 1970. The city is located in the midst of a rich mining and fishing region. Several industries in Thunder Bay are involved in brewing, flour milling, paper milling, truck and aircraft manufacturing, and shipbuilding. The city is easily accessible by boat, highway, and rail. It has an estimated population of 114,000.\nTROIS RIVIÈRES (Three Rivers), in Quebec, is the second oldest city in the province. Founded in 1634, it is predated only by Quebec City, which was established in 1608. The city has a strong manufacturing base. Factories in Trois Rivières produce clothing, electrical appliances, paper, textiles, shoes, and wood pulp. Abundant woodlands, combined with a large hydroelectric plant make the city one of the world's largest producers of news-print. It has a beautiful 17th-century Anglican church, and a Gothic-style cathedral whose stained-glass windows are among the most exquisite on this continent. Approximately 51,800 people live in the city.\nWHITEHORSE , the capital of the Yukon, is headquarters for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Its population is roughly 20,700. The Yukon was the site of the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898. The Gay Nineties days are relived every summer. Dramond Tooth Gerties in Dawson is a gambling casino, with blackjack and roulette tables. Other points of interest in Whitehorse include the McBride Museum, which features an in depth look at Yukon heritage and wildlife, a tour aboard the restored steamboat S.S. Klondike and a guided tour of the city.\nYELLOWKNIFE , capital of the Northwest Territories, is one of Canada's youngest cities (1935). It is only 275 miles south of the Arctic Circle. From May through July, this is the land of the midnight sun. In late June, Yellowknife hosts the Pacific Western Midnight Sun Golf Tournament. The Northwest Territories covers one-third of Canada's land area, but the total population is only about 14,000. Coppermine, Cambridge Bay, Bathurst Inlet, and Bay Chimo are small communities north of Yellowknife.\nCOUNTRY PROFILE\nGeography and Climate\nThe world's second largest country in land area (3,851,809 square miles), Canada is bordered on the north by the Arctic Ocean, on the northeast by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean and Alaska.\nMuch of Canada's industry is concentrated in the southeast near the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, in an environment similar to adjacent areas of the U.S. To the northeast are the rolling Appalachian country of southern Quebec, the Maritime Provinces, and the Island of Newfoundland. The most outstanding physical feature is the Shield, a rugged area of Precambrian rock which surrounds Hudson Bay and covers most of eastern and central Canada—almost half of the country. This semi-barren area, and the Arctic Archipelago to the north, are sparsely populated and as yet largely undeveloped.\nAnother major region is the Canadian prairies, an extension of the mid-continent Great Plains. This area lies between the western border of the Shield and the Canadian Rockies. It is the Canadian bread-basket, and an area that is also rich in petroleum, gas, and other mineral resources.\nFar-western Canada, comprised mostly of British Columbia, is laced with towering mountain ranges. Most people here live on the temperate southwest coast and Vancouver Island.\nThe climate varies greatly in the many diversified regions—ranging from frigid to mild—but Canada generally may be described as lying in the cool temperate zone, with long, cold winters.\nPopulation\nMore than two-thirds of Canada's 31.3 million people live within 100 miles of the U.S. border. Canadians and Americans are not \"just alike,\" however, as many observers often assume. The Canadian character and outlook have been forged from a distinctive historical and social background which has produced a \"Canadian way of life\" that flourishes in a sovereign nation.\nAbout 28% of the population is of British stock, about 23% of French, 15% is other European, and about 2% is indigenous Indian and Inuits (Eskimos). Canada's more than six million French-speaking citizens are mainly descendants of colonists who settled the country three centuries ago. They are concentrated in the Province of Quebec, although about 20% live in other parts of the country, mainly Ontario and New Brunswick. There is a sizeable French community in Manitoba as well.\nThe English-speaking population has been built up by immigration from the British Isles. The largest influx from the U.S. occurred during the American Revolution, when thousands of \"Empire Loyalists\" fled to Canada. Most settled in \"Upper Canada,\" in southern and southeastern Ontario. Those Canadians who are of neither British nor French origin are mainly Germans, Ukrainians, Scandinavians, Italians, Dutch, Poles, Chinese, Indians, and Pakistanis.\nReligion plays an important, though diminishing, role in the life of the Canadian. About 42% are Roman Catholics. The largest Protestant denomination, about 17% of the population, is the United Church of Canada—a union of Methodists, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians. Almost 10% are Anglicans, with Presbyterians, Lutherans, Baptists, and Jews next in number.\nGovernment\nCanada's parliamentary system of government reflects both its Old World heritage and its North American experience. The British North America Act of 1867 provided a written constitution, similar to that of the British. The lack of specific guarantees of rights, combined with profound regional disputes, led to serious consideration of a truly Canadian constitution in the late 1970s. After years of discussions, then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau \"brought home the constitution\" in 1982. Following British Parliament approval, Queen Elizabeth II and Trudeau signed the Constitution Act on Ottawa's Parliament Hill in April 1982. Included in the new constitution is a Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\nMany of the country's legal and parliamentary practices are derived from ancient custom, as in Great Britain. On the other hand, the 10 provinces are united in a federal system resembling that in the U.S., though provinces have greater responsibilities and powers than have American states.\nQueen Elizabeth II is the head of the Canadian state, and is a symbol of Canada's Commonwealth status. Her personal representative in Canada is the Governor-General.\nParliament consists of the Crown, the Senate, and the House of Commons, the latter clearly having the dominant voice in legislation. Its 282 members are elected for nominal five-year terms. The Senate's 104 members are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister, and hold office until mandatory retirement at age 75.\nExecutive power is vested in the Cabinet, headed by the prime minister, who is the leader of the political party in power. The Cabinet remains in power as long as it retains majority support in the House on major issues.\nProvincial government is patterned much along the lines of the central government. Each province is governed by a premier and a single, elected legislative chamber. A lieutenant governor, appointed by the governor-general, represents the Crown.\nCriminal law, a parliamentary prerogative, is uniform throughout the nation, and is largely based on British law. Civil law is based on English common law, except in Quebec. Here, civil law is derived from the Napoleonic Code. Justice is administered by federal, provincial, and municipal courts.\nDuring the past century, national politics has been dominated by two major parties, the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives. While these parties have adopted many traditions from their British counterparts, there are substantial differences. The Liberals correspond, in very general terms, to the Democratic Party in the U.S., while the Progressive Conservatives would be the rough equivalent of the Republican Party. Distinctions between the two parties, however, are increasingly blurred since both take a pragmatic approach to Canada's problems.\nAlso represented in parliament and active in provincial politics is the New Democratic Party (NDP). The NDP corresponds roughly to the social democratic parties of Europe. The Communist Party is almost insignificant, and holds no seat in either the federal or provincial legislatures.\nCanada is a member of the British Commonwealth, the United Nations, United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), World Health Organization (WHO), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the following international associations: Inter-American Development Bank, International Energy Agency, International Sugar Organization, International Wool Study Group, and the International Wheat Council.\nThe Canadian flag consists of a red maple leaf on a white background, flanked by vertical bands of red.\nArts, Science, Education\nThe development of the arts in Canada reflects not only the country's culture and geography, but also bears the imprint of a rapidly growing nation. The existence of two dominant cultural traditions—French and English—has led to a diversity in the arts. Focal points of artistic activity have grown up in several metropolitan centers scattered about the country. Since World War II, economic growth has given Canadians greater means to practice and enjoy the arts, and the influx of immigrants has increased the pool of available talent.\nAll provincial governments, through various departments, agencies, or educational institutions, provide some assistance for professional and amateur artists within their borders. The federally funded, as well as privately funded, Canada Council administers a similar program on a national scale.\nWell-known artistic groups include the Stratford Festival Company, the Montreal Symphony, Toronto's Canadian Opera Company, and the Winnipeg Ballet. All of these groups make extensive tours throughout North America, and occasionally tour abroad.\nA technologically advanced nation, Canada needs and produces much scientific activity. Most major research projects reflect the increasingly interdependent industrial, university, and government laboratories. In addition, considerable scientific cooperation is undertaken with other nations—especially with the U.S. and the U.K.\nAll of Canada's activities in the field of atomic energy are the responsibility of the federal government. The most diversified program of scientific research is carried out by the National Research Council—a federal agency. On the other hand, most basic medical research is conducted by universities.\nEducation at the elementary and secondary level is the responsibility of provincial governments; curricula and teacher qualifications vary a great deal. In all provinces, public education is free. Ages of mandatory attendance vary from province to province, but are generally from seven to 15. In Halifax, Vancouver, and Winnipeg, free public education is controlled and funded by public school boards, as in the U.S. Private schools, primarily Roman Catholic, exist as well, and charge tuition. The literacy rate is estimated to be 99%.\nIn other Canadian cities, free public education is funded and controlled locally by two types of boards—either \"public\" or \"separate.\" Except in Quebec, the public boards are nondenominational, reflecting a Protestant and English historical development; the separate boards are Roman Catholic. In Quebec, the public boards are Roman Catholic—further divided into boards for French-and English-speaking children; the separate boards are nondenominational, also with French and English subdivisions. Both types of boards fund public education from property taxes. Parents usually cannot elect to send children in the same family to schools controlled by different boards.\nEducation at the elementary level in Canada is considered to be on a par with schools in the U.S. At the secondary level, schools in Ontario and the western provinces are also considered to be at par, but in Montreal, Quebec City, and Halifax, schools at the secondary level do not always meet these standards.\nIn the non-French-speaking areas of Ottawa, Toronto, and Winnipeg, local school districts offer French-language instruction at all levels. In elementary schools, there are generally two tracks of instruction—a required French course, or an optional immersion program, which begins in kindergarten and offers instruction totally in French, with English being phased in gradually in the third or fourth grade. At the secondary level, French is usually optional and is offered along with other languages, such as German and Spanish. At other places (outside Quebec), French is offered on an optional basis, primarily at the secondary level. In English-speaking schools in Quebec Province, French is also a required subject at all levels.\nCanada's 60 universities range from small liberal arts colleges with as few as 1,000 students to multiversities (made up of colleges, faculties, and research institutes) with enrollments as high as 20,000. Most instruction is in English—although some institutions use French only—whereas both English and French are used at the University of Ottawa and two other institutions. There are numerous community colleges, usually called technical schools.\nCommerce and Industry\nThe Canadian economy is highly developed, giving Canadians one of the highest standards of living in the world. Manufacturing is concentrated in transportation and communications equipment, engineering, and steel and consumer goods. Especially notable is the production of motor vehicles and parts, encouraged by the auto pact between the U.S. and Canada. Most manufacturing is concentrated in Ontario and Quebec.\nAlberta is growing fast in industries related to oil and natural gas. Primary industries built on Canada's rich natural resources remain an important part of the economy and a major source of exports. Leading resource industries are: forest products; oil, natural gas, and hydroelectric power; grains and other agricultural products; mining of asbestos, potash, and nonferrous metals; and fishing. As in other developed countries, the service sector is growing rapidly.\nThe economy is closely linked by trade and investment with other countries, especially the U.S. Foreign  trade, two-thirds of which is with the U.S., represents more than one-fifth of total output. There is considerable two-way direct investment between the U.S. and Canada, although the level of U.S. investment in Canada is higher, as is its relative importance in the economy.\nAmericans find that most products and services available in the U.S. are also available in Canada. Local prices are often higher, but this may be offset by a favorable exchange rate for the Canadian dollar.\nThe main office of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce is located at 55 Metcalf St., Ste. 1160, Ottawa, Ontario K1P 6N4. There are regional offices in all of the provinces.\nTransportation\nExcept in the remote northern areas, Canada possesses an advanced transportation system in all modes comparable to that in the U.S. An extensive air network links all major and many minor traffic points with adequate connections to the rest of the world. Domestic air fares per mile are higher than in the U.S., and distances between population centers are considerably greater. A good highway system (with somewhat less emphasis on interstate-type roads) exists, and supports extensive truck, bus, and automobile traffic.\nThe Canadian railroad system, while vast, has many problems similar to those affecting the U.S. Although passenger service continues to exist, it is poor except in the Quebec-Windsor corridor.\nWater transportation is important largely from the foreign trade viewpoint. Major ports exist at Vancouver, Montreal, other St. Lawrence River points, Halifax, and St. John (New Brunswick). The Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway and River System is an important domestic and binational transport route, which permits the movement of smaller-sized oceangoing vessels as far west as Duluth, Minnesota and Thunder Bay, Ontario.\nAll larger cities have public transit systems, generally buses. There are subways in Montreal and Toronto, and streetcars in Toronto and Calgary; plans are being formulated to develop rail systems in Edmonton and elsewhere. By and large, Canadian cities have public transportation arrangements at least as good as in American cities of similar size. They are better developed closer to the city's downtown center. Low population densities have inhibited the development of equivalent service in distant suburbs. The operation of public transport is frequently subsidized by provincial and local governments, making most fares reasonable.\nIn spite of extensive public transportation arrangements, Canada is as much an automobile society as the U.S. All American automobile manufacturers have plants in Canada, producing standard North American vehicles, and the greater portion of the automobile market in Canada is shared by these manufacturers. Most European and Japanese models found in the U.S. are also sold in Canada. Spare parts are available for all these vehicles. Repair facilities in the major cities compare to those in the U.S. There may be service problems with some European and Japanese cars outside the major cities, but most cars can be serviced readily except, perhaps, in remote areas.\nU.S. grades of gasoline (leaded and unleaded) are widely available, and are sold in liters. Safety standards for cars are similar in the U.S. and Canada. Left-hand-drive vehicles are standard; traffic moves on the right. International highway symbols are used in Canada, and distances have been converted to the metric system. Seat belts and infant/child seat restraints are mandatory in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia. Fines are imposed for non-use of seat belts and child restraints.\nCommunications\nTelephone service, provided by the Bell Telephone Company of Canada in Ontario and Quebec, and by provincial companies in other provinces, is excellent. Canada (except for the Northwest Territories) is integrated with the U.S. direct distance dialing system. Telegraph services are operated by the two transcontinental railway companies, and by the federal government to outlying districts.\nMail service within and from Canada to other countries is satisfactory. All first-class mail is airmail within Canada at no extra cost, and letters to the U.S. require only a regular first-class stamp. There is no censorship, and customs formalities are minimal.\nBroadcasting is well developed in Canada. Radio and TV stations operate in all major cities and carry extensive amounts of U.S. programming. There are two national TV networks (CBC and CTV), and independent TV stations also exist in many large cities. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) operates an extensive radio network, with domestic (AM and FM), northern, and international short-wave service. It operates dual networks for English and French programming; there are even French outlets in the western cities where the francophone population is limited. The Province of Quebec also has its own French-language broadcasting system. The Province of Ontario operates an impressive educational TV system which, at night, features nonacademic programs.\nDirect reception of nearby U.S. radio and TV stations is possible in many parts of Canada. In most Canadian cities there is a well-developed cable TV system which relays most of the U.S. networks (including PBS), some distant Canadian stations for an additional charge, and distant FM radio as well.\nAbout 109 daily newspapers are published in Canada—89% are in  English, the rest in French. Most major cities have at least two local papers, usually morning and evening. Ottawa has only one daily, The Citizen. About six Canadian newspapers publish a Sunday edition. Most cities receive major U.S. newspapers within a few days of publication. (The New York Times is available daily, including Sundays, in Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal.)\nMost American magazines and books are available, but usually at slightly higher prices. Maclean's, a biweekly, is the only national Canadian news magazine. Reader's Digest publishes a Canadian edition.\nHealth\nMedical care in Canada is excellent. Competent doctors, dentists, and specialists in all fields are available, and most, except in some areas of Quebec, speak English. Canadian medical educational standards are equivalent to those in the U.S., particularly in dentistry and ophthalmology. There is a shortage of trained personnel and facilities in the physical rehabilitation field, although availability of these services has improved in recent years.\nLaboratories and hospitals maintain high standards and are well equipped. Professional fees and hospital and prescription drug costs are comparable to those in the U.S. Pharmaceutical facilities are excellent.\nThere are no special health risks. Standards of community health and sanitation are very good, and no diseases are endemic to large cities; however, several possible health problems should be noted. Winnipeg's climate might affect visitors seriously afflicted with asthma, sinusitis, or Raynaud's disease, a circulatory vascular condition. Hay fever sufferers should remember that Toronto has the highest pollen count of any large North American city. While the hay fever season is short—about six weeks—persons with hay fever experience great discomfort unless they take medication or remain in air-conditioned areas.\nClothing and Services\nAmericans find that tastes and standards in clothing are basically the same as in the U.S. The climate in winter makes warm clothes essential. For the most part, summers are somewhat cooler in Canada, but hot periods occur, and lightweight clothing is necessary. Wraps are usually needed for evenings, even in summer. Children dress casually, as in the U.S., but those who attend private schools ordinarily wear uniforms.\nReady-made clothes of all kinds are available at every price level. Items manufactured in the U.S. are expensive—often one-third higher than the American retail price.\nPractically all services and supplies are available in the cities throughout Canada. The prices are often higher, but the current favorable exchange rate offsets the expense. Domestic help is difficult to find (as in the U.S.), and if the level of competence and experience is favorable, wages also are high. Professional catering and cleaning services are available.\nNOTES FOR TRAVELERS\nPassage, Customs & Duties\nWhen entering from the United States, U.S. citizens must show either a U.S. passport or proof of U.S. citizenship and photo ID. U.S. citizens entering Canada from a third country must have a valid passport. A visa is not required for U.S. citizens for a stay up to 180 days. Anyone with a criminal record (including a DWI charge) should contact the Canadian Embassy or nearest Canadian consulate before travel. For further information on entry requirements, travelers may contact the Embassy of Canada at 501 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001, telephone (202) 682-1740, Internet address:http://www.cdnemb-washdc.org; or the Canadian consulates in Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York, San Juan or Seattle.\nU.S. citizens living in or visiting Canada may register at the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy or at a U.S. Consulate General in Canada, and may obtain updated information on travel and security within Canada.\nThe U.S. Embassy is in Ottawa, Ontario, at 490 Sussex Drive, K1N 1G8, telephone (613) 238-5335, fax (613) 688-3082.

From countries recognized by Canada to be free of rabies, a certificate issued by a veterinarian of the National Veterinary Service of the country of origin is required, certifying that the animal has been in that country for a continuous six-month period preceding shipment. From all other countries, a certificate issued by a veterinarian of the National Veterinary Service should certify that the animal was vaccinated against rabies not less than 30 days nor more than one year preceding shipment. Dogs and cats from countries other than the U.S. arriving without a certificate will be placed in quarantine for a 30-day period and vaccinated for rabies.\nFirearms & Ammunition\nFirearms are strictly controlled. As of January 1, 2001, visitors bringing firearms into Canada, or planning to borrow and use firearms while in Canada, are required to declare the firearms in writing using a Non-Resident Firearm Declaration form. Multiple firearms can be declared on the same form. At the border, three copies of the unsigned declaration must be presented to a Canadian Customs officer. The declaration will serve as a temporary license and registration certificate for up to 60 days. The Non-Resident Firearm Declaration costs $50 (Canadian). Visitors planning to borrow a firearm in Canada must obtain in advance a Temporary Firearms Borrowing License, which costs $30 (Canadian). The form must be signed before a Canadian Customs officer and the fee paid at the border. In order to save time at the border, Canadian authorities recommend that visitors complete the declaration form, but not sign it, and make two copies of the completed form before arriving at the port-of-entry. Requests made at the border for photocopies of the form may be denied. Full details on this new policy are available at the Canadian Firearms Centre web site,http://www.cfc-ccaf.gc.ca, under the heading \"Visitors to Canada.\" The Non-Resident Firearm Declaration and the Temporary Firearms Borrowing License applications may also be obtained from this web site.\nCanada has three classes of firearms: non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited. Non-restricted firearms include most ordinary hunting rifles and shotguns. These may be brought temporarily into Canada for sporting or hunting use during hunting season, for use in competitions, for in-transit movement through Canada, or for personal protection against wildlife in remote areas of Canada. Anyone wishing to bring hunting rifles into Canada must be at least 18 years old, and the firearm must be properly stored for transport. Restricted firearms are primarily handguns; however, pepper spray and mace are also included in this category. A restricted firearm may be brought into Canada, but an Authorization to Transport permit must be obtained in advance from a Provincial or Territorial Chief Firearms Officer. Prohibited firearms include fully automatic, converted automatics, and assault-type weapons. Prohibited firearms are not allowed into Canada.\nIn advance of any travel, please contact a Canadian embassy or consulate, or the Canadian Firearms Centre (http://www.cfc.ccaf.gc.ca) for detailed information and instructions on temporarily importing firearms. In all cases, travelers must declare to Canadian Customs authorities any firearms and weapons in their possession when entering Canada. If a traveler is denied permission to bring in the firearm, there are often facilities near border crossings where firearms may be stored, pending the traveler's return to the United States. Canadian law requires that officials confiscate firearms and weapons from those crossing the border who deny having them in their possession. Confiscated firearms and weapons are never returned.\nCurrency, Banking, and Weights and Measures\nCanada covers seven time zones. The time in Newfoundland is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) minus three-and-a-half. The time in Halifax is GMT minus four. The time in Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, Hamilton, London, and Windsor is GMT minus five (Eastern Time in the U.S.). The time in Winnipeg and Regina is GMT minus six (Central Time in the U.S.). The time in Calgary and Edmonton is GMT minus seven (Mountain Time in the U.S.). The time in Vancouver is GMT minus eight (Pacific Time in the U.S.).\nThe unit of currency is the Canadian dollar, divided into half-dollar, quarter, dime, nickel, and penny coins, all similar in size and shape to U.S. currency. Canadian and U.S. dollars are fully convertible at  banks. The conversion rate fluctuates.\nCanada officially adopted the metric system in September 1977. Most road signs are now showing distances in kilometers and speed limits in kilometers/hour. Containers show contents and weights in both pounds and ounces, quarts and kilograms, and grams and liters.\nLOCAL HOLIDAYS\nThe Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.\nCopyright The Columbia University Press\nCanada (kăn´ədə), independent nation (2001 pop. 30,007,094), 3,851,787 sq mi (9,976,128 sq km), N North America.

Canada has historically been a society of immigrants and of regions. First, the Aboriginal, or native people, arrived from Asia about ten thousand years ago. They organized into complex national groups with their own distinct cultures, economic bases, and languages. Norsemen explored but did not settle Canada in the years before 1500. French explorers and colonists arrived in the early seventeenth century and continued to settle throughout the first half of the next. The British began arriving in the early eighteenth century. After skirmishes and a decisive battle between the French and British armies in 1763, the British came to dominate the part of North America that is today Canada. In 1867 Confederation—Canada's founding event—set the groundwork for provincial differentiation (Quebec versus the rest), two official languages (French and English), two privileged religions (Protestantism and Catholicism), and what became known in the late twentieth century as \"multiculturalism.\"\nVaried timetables of immigration, economic opportunities, and demographic mixes caused Canada's regions to develop differently from one another. Their lack of similarity was largely due to Canada's enormous size, disparate economic development, and the distances between communities. Unequal educational opportunities and social mobility maintained the ethnic and class distinctions that made Canada what the sociologist John Porter came to call a \"vertical mosaic.\"\nToday, with more postsecondary education, travel, and mass communication, these ethnic and regional variations have begun to shrink. In this entry we will emphasize similarities and general tendencies. The theme of diversity remains important, though, as it is essential to understanding Canadian family life.\nDefining Families\nCanadians generally derive a great deal of pleasure from their families. In a 1994 Angus Reid opinion poll, two-thirds of Canadians strongly agreed with the statement that their families are \"the greatest joy in their lives.\" Yet the meaning of family varies from one person to the next. Statistics Canada, the branch of the Canadian government responsible for collecting and analyzing national data, defines the family as\na now-married couple (with or without never-married sons and/or daughters of either or both spouses), a couple living common-law (with or without never-married sons and/or daughters of either or both partners), or a lone parent of any marital status, with at least one never-married son or daughter living in the same dwelling. (Statistics Canada, 1999, p. 119)\nThey call this family form the census family and it is the basic unit upon which the agency collects its family data. Unless otherwise noted, the statistics discussed throughout this article will refer to this family arrangement.\nAlthough a majority of Canadians live in census families—83 percent in 1996—a significant proportion do not (Gee 2000). In 1996 just under a quarter (24.1%) of households were made up of a single person, and 4 percent consisted of people who were either unrelated, or related but did not meet the census definition of a family. The agency also overlooks relations of affection and support that occur outside the immediate household (e.g. relations between absent parents and their children, and between elderly parents living independently from their adult children). Thus, the fairly narrow definition held by Statistics Canada fails to portray accurately the variety of Canadian family and household forms.\nTrends in Marriage\nMore than one hundred years ago, settlers from northern and western Europe brought norms that dictated that young people establish independent homes upon marriage (Gee 1982). As a result, many people did not marry, or they married late in life because they did not have the financial resources to support a household. In 1921 the average age of marriage for men was twenty-eight years and for women it was just under twenty-five. In some ethnic groups—for example, those descended from Highland Scots—the average age of marriage was even higher.\nHistorically, marriage rates in Canada have fluctuated with the state of the country's economy. In the 1930s, while Canada experienced the Great Depression, many couples refrained from marrying due to economic uncertainty and high unemployment. Marriage rates decreased from 7.5 marriages per 1,000 people in 1928 to 5.9 in 1932 (Milan 2000). It was not until World War II that Canadians began to marry again in large numbers. New employment opportunities stimulated the increased rate of matrimony, as did the possibility of conscription. Single men were being called to wartime service, and many couples tried to prevent this through marriage. As a result, in 1942 there were almost eleven marriages per 1,000 people—nearly twice the marriage rate of a decade earlier. The rate declined while the men were at war, but it returned to its 1942 level when couples were reunited in 1946.\nBy the late 1940s marriage rates began to drop again and continued to decline until the 1970s, when children of the postwar marriages, called the baby boom generation, were themselves ready to marry. However, in the 1980s marriage rates returned to a downward trend, and in 1998 they reached an unprecedented low of five marriages per 1,000 people. Fewer Canadians were choosing to marry than ever before, although the economy was not a major influence in this decline.\nTypically, nations with low marriage rates are late marrying populations, so along with the fluctuations in the incidence of marriage rates came a variation in the average age of first marriage. During the early twentieth century, couples married late in life. This changed in the years following World War II, as marriage rates increased and the average age at first marriage declined steadily. By 1962 the average age had dropped to 25.2 years for men and 22.5 for women. The increased affluence following World War II contributed to lowering the age at first marriage because couples could then afford to marry earlier.\nSince the late 1960s, the age at first marriage has risen again. In 1997, for example, first-time brides were, on average, 27.4 years old and grooms were 29.5 year old (The Vanier Institute 2000). This increase has been associated with, among other factors, greater acceptance of cohabitation without marriage, as well as more education and economic independence for women. So paradoxically, though current figures are similar to those earlier in the century, the reasons behind them are quite different.\nCohabitation versus Marriage\nMost Canadian families, 74 percent, were based in married couple unions in 1996. However, membership in this group had declined since 1986, when 80 percent of all couples were legally married. The decreased rate of marriage has been associated with a corresponding increase in common-law unions. Statistics Canada defines a common-law couple as \"two persons of opposite sex who are not legally married to each other, but live together as husband and wife in the same dwelling.\" Although historically Canadians frowned on couples who lived together before marriage, more recently the stigma against nonmarital cohabitation has diminished, if not disappeared. By the end of the millennium, the common-law union was the fastest-growing family category. In 1996 one in seven couples in Canada was living common law, compared with one in nine in 1991. Nonmarital cohabitation was most prevalent in the province of Quebec, where one in four couples live common-law and 43 percent of all such relationships in Canada occurred (Bélanger et al. 2001).\nFor some Canadians, nonmarital cohabitation is a temporary state that precedes a legal marriage, but for others it is a permanent substitute for marriage. There are important differences between legal marriage and cohabitation, despite their perceived interchangeability in some quarters (Baker 2001). Canadian society provides less protection for the property rights of partners in common-law relationships than those of legally married partners. Common-law relationships are typically shorter, produce fewer children, and have a greater tendency towards spousal abuse. They are also particularly vulnerable to changes in economic circumstances (Wu and Pollard 2000). Finally, cohabiting relationships and post-cohabiting marriages are at greater risk of dissolution than are marriages not preceded by cohabitation. The last factor is likely due to what researchers call adverse selectivity. That is, these relationships attract people who are more willing to dissolve unsatisfactory relationships, rather than remain in them unhappily.\nHowever, marriage is not necessarily better than cohabitation. Once other factors (including adverse selectivity) are controlled, physical and mental health differences between cohabiters and the currently married disappear, and both categories are better off than the divorced, separated, and single/never married.\nDivorce\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, divorce was rare in Canada. In 1900 a mere eleven divorces were registered. People widely disapproved of divorce, and the law restricted it. Until 1968, adultery was the only grounds for divorce. Families did dissolve during this period: Some spouses canceled their spousal and parental responsibilities by simply abandoning their families. However, they remained married under law, and this prevented remarriage and the legal establishment of a new family.\nThe introduction of the Divorce Act in 1968 led to a massive change in family behaviors. This law allowed judges to grant divorces on the grounds of \"marriage-breakdown,\" after a couple had been separated for at least three years. Between 1968 and 1970, the number of divorces nearly doubled. A subsequent amendment to the Divorce Act in 1986 reduced the minimum period of separation to one year. Again, this modification resulted in a huge increase in divorce, with the number peaking at 90,900 divorces in 1987 (Oderkirk 1994).\nBetween 1965 and 1988, Canada's divorce rate went from being one of the lowest among industrialized nations to being one of the highest, surpassing even the divorce rates in progressive countries such as France and Sweden. In 1991, once divorce rates had leveled off, there were still 2.8 divorces per 1,000 people in Canada, compared with 1.9 in France and 2.5 in Sweden (in 1992). However, the American divorce rate surpassed that of Canada. In 1992 there were 4.8 divorces per 1,000 people in the United States—nearly twice the Canadian rate (Dumas 1994).\nVariations on the Dominant Pattern\nImmigrant families. In the years following Confederation, wave upon wave of immigrants arrived in Canada, often \"imported\" into particular regions to carry out specific economic tasks: from China to construct the railroad, from Eastern Europe to settle the prairie wheatlands, from Southern Europe to build the central cities. Yet government legislation at the time effectively prevented the development of certain ethnic communities, especially among Asian and black immigrants (Das Gupta 2000). For instance, in the early twentieth century, Chinese immigrants had to pay a \"head tax\" to gain entrance to Canada. Since most men could not afford to bring their wife and children into the country, this law systematically prevented the creation of Chinese Canadian families.\nBefore the mid-twentieth century, Canadian immigration policy favored European settlement in hopes of maintaining a predominantly Anglo-Saxon society (Richard 1991). Immigration from non-European countries was severely restricted. This changed as popular opinion in the early 1960s turned against restrictions on nonwhite immigration. In 1968 a new immigration policy was set up that based admission eligibility not on ethnicity or race, but on broader criteria such as education and training, skills, personal attributes (such as adaptability, motivation, and initiative), demand for the applicant's occupation in Canada, arranged employment, and knowledge of English or French. In the decades that followed, the numbers of British and American immigrants to Canada decreased, and immigration from Asian countries increased substantially.\nMany immigrants came from cultures in which men subordinate women, and their elders subordinate young people. Migration creates profound changes in the relationship between men and women, as well as between generations; it disrupts traditional expectations and supports the possibility of individuation (Shahidian 1999).\nWomen's experience of cultural displacement through immigration may be more positive than that of men because women may be less inclined to resist the women-friendlier dominant culture. For example, more Iranian men retained the socially conservative nature of their patriarchal home culture after immigration than did Iranian women, and they also experienced more problems in adjusting to Western social and economic trends, and to changes in gender roles that augment women's notions of self and female sexuality (Moghissi and Goodman 1999). On the other hand, institutional racism may counterbalance women's positive experiences (Moghissi 1999).\nMigration can lead to generational conflict as young people attempt to embrace North American society (Tirone and Pedlar 2000). Young immigrants, or the children of immigrants, may have problems adjusting to school life, have strained family relationships, and experience issues of ethnic identity and minority status. Often community organizations help young people—especially women—develop an awareness of their condition, a new identity, and a measure of control over their lives (Ralston 1998).\nIn the new cultural environment, families become more nuclear, with the result that extended families loosen their grip, and a cultural distance builds up between members of the diaspora and members of the homeland (Chan and Dorais 1998). Some communities, such as the Asian Indians in Toronto, modify traditional patterns of arranged marriage to give the young more freedom while at the same time enforcing traditional group expectations.\nThe post-1960s amendments to the Immigration Act have led to greater ethnic diversity in Canada, especially among nonwhite groups. While one might expect this to have increased inmarriage (or endogamy) among newly enlarged minority groups, paradoxically, the opposite has occurred. The postwar \"merit-point system\" created a stream of affluent and highly educated new entrants. People with higher levels of education are more exogamous: that is, they show a greater tendency to marry outside their group (Richard 1991). It is therefore not surprising that ethnic exogamy has been increasing.\nHowever, Canadians have always practiced ethnic intermarriage, and this trend has been on the rise since the time of Confederation. In 1991 Canada-born husbands and wives were more exogamous than their foreign-born counterparts, and higher proportions of males married out of their ethnic group than females. Groups who have had high rates of immigration—such as Asian Indians and Chinese—showed the lowest rates of exogamy. Canadians of French and English descent also have low levels of ethnic out-marriage, probably because their large numbers in the Canadian population make it easier to find a spouse of the same ethnic group. Overall, members of the British and French \"charter groups\" are a popular choice of mate. Both men and women tend to marry members of these groups, if they do not marry people of their own ethnic background (Kalbach 2000).\nSame-sex unions. Although fewer social barriers prevent marriage between people of different ethnic groups, the same is not true for same-sex partners. Although Canadians are more liberal in their views on homosexuality than Americans or Mexicans (Tepperman and Curtis 2002)—religious ideas continue to fuel discrimination against homosexuals and their right to form families. In Canada, as in most nations, gays and lesbians are unable to legally marry because marriage continues to be defined as a union between a man and a woman. Gays and lesbians are often portrayed as being outside of and excluded from family social relations. In reality, many are deeply embedded in familial structures as partners, parents, children, siblings, aunts, uncles, and grandchildren.\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, same-sex couples had gained some of the recognition and benefits automatically granted to heterosexual couples. In February 1998 the province of British Columbia became the first jurisdiction in North America to redefine the term \"spouse\" in its Family Relations Act to include same-sex couples. The amendment gave gay and lesbian partners the same privileges and obligations held by those in heterosexual unions, including: custody of children, access, and child support (O'Brian and Goldberg 2000). In 1999 and 2000 Quebec, Ontario, and the federal government adopted omnibus bills granting same-sex common-law spouses almost all the same rights as heterosexual couples under the tax system, social security programs, and family law (Rose 2000). Additionally, in 2001 Statistics Canada included questions about same-sex unions for the first time in the national census.\nThese changes showed the growing acceptance of gay and lesbian couples in Canadian society. Public opinion polls confirmed that Canadians are becoming more accepting of same-sex unions. In a 2001 Leger Marketing poll, 65.4 percent of those surveyed agreed that Canada should grant same-sex couples the right to legally marry and 75.7 percent felt that Canada should give homosexuals the same rights as heterosexuals.\nHowever, these tolerant attitudes do not extend to the issue of childcare. For example, only 53.1 percent of those surveyed agreed that Canada should permit homosexuals to adopt children. This disapproval of adoption by gays and lesbians likely reflects the belief that homosexual parenting will have a harmful influence on the child's sexual development. By contrast, research on the topic shows that children raised by gays and lesbians exhibit neither a greater tendency toward homosexuality nor significant differences in gender identity or gender behaviors than children raised by heterosexual parents (O'Brien and Goldberg 2000).\nFamilies with Children\nThe addition of a child has an enormous impact on any family. Family dynamics and relations are often altered to accommodate the new member. Typically, a woman's dependence on her partner's earnings, and thereby her vulnerability within the family, increases with the presence of young children and relative to the number of children. This pattern is similar—indeed, deeply entrenched— across Western industrial countries, and continues even in the face of active social policies to minimize their effects (Bianchi, Casper, and Peltola 1999). From this standpoint, fertility and fertility decline play important roles in changing gender relations and family life, in Canada and elsewhere.\nFertility Decline\nThe average size of the Canadian family has dropped since the 1970s. In 1971 families had an average of 3.7 persons; since 1986, the average has remained constant at 3.1 persons. Contemporary Canadian families are similar in size to those in the United States, where an average of 3.2 persons made up the American family in 2000 (Fields and Casper 2000). These small family sizes are mainly a result of lower fertility and reduced childbearing, as showed by lower birth rates.\nIn fact, birth rates have been dropping in most industrialized countries since the latter part of the nineteenth century. These rates have fluctuated slightly over that period. For instance, after World War II (roughly 1946–1966), both Canada and the United States experienced high birth rates in what people refer to as the postwar baby boom. During this boom, the total fertility rate (TFR)—the average number of children a woman is likely to bear in her lifetime—peaked at 3.94 children in 1959, and actual birth rates peaked in 1957 (Péron et al. 1999).\nThe Canadian TFR dropped dramatically from its height in the 1960s, and fertility remained fairly stable through the mid-1970s to the end of the millennium. After 1976, the rate fluctuated between 1.8 and 1.6, although 1998 saw a slight drop in TFR to 1.55 births (Bélanger et al. 2001). These rates have varied across the country, illustrating Canada's regional and ethnic diversity. In 1998 Newfoundland had the lowest fertility rate in Canada, at 1.2 births per woman. In the same year Nunavut, a region with a high proportion of Aboriginal peoples, had a fertility rate of three births per woman.\nCanadian women give birth to more children than do women in many European countries. This is largely because of high rates of immigration from high-fertility countries. Still, the Canadian fertility rate is below that of the United States, where in 1997 American women were estimated to bear\n2.06 children in their lifetimes (Bélanger 1999).\nNot only are Canadian couples having fewer children than in the past; they are also having children later in life. Many Canadian women now wait until they are in their late twenties or early thirties before having their first child. The mother's age at childbirth, which varies by region and ethnicity, also varies according to social and economic status. Women who have children early typically have less education and fewer job skills (therefore, lower job possibilities and less income potential). Young mothers are also more likely to be unmarried, so many must deal with the economic difficulties associated with single parenthood.\nSingle-Parent Families\nAmong those Canadian marriages that dissolved in 1995, child custody was a concern in approximately 70 percent of these cases. In more than two-thirds of these divorces, the courts granted mothers sole custody of their offspring. Thus, many women in Canada who experienced divorce also became single parents.\nOf the 1.1 million single parents enumerated in 1996, 58 percent were separated or divorced, 22 percent were single or never married, and 20 percent were widows. The vast majority, 83 percent, were women (The Vanier Institute 2000). This gender difference is significant because female-headed single-parent families are more likely to suffer from lower incomes—indeed, poverty—than male-headed single-parent families. In 1998 single-parent families headed by women made up the largest fraction of all low-income families. Women-headed families were more than twice as likely as male-headed families to be living in poverty (42% versus 17.5%).\nThe number of Canadian single-parent families increased dramatically since the 1970s: almost 250 percent between 1971 and 1996, compared with an overall increase of only 55 percent in the total number of Canadian families. These rates mark a return to proportions seen in the early decades of the twentieth century. In 1931, for example, 13.6 percent of Canadian families were headed by one parent; this is compared to 15 percent in 1996. However, the reasons for single parenthood have changed during this century. Whereas in the first half of the twentieth century, most single-parent households were a result of the death of a spouse, in the second half of the century they were mainly the result of separation, divorce, or nonmarriage (Oderkirk and Lochhead 1992).\nFamilies over the Life Course\nCanada's population is aging. This results from a combination of lowered fertility and general increases in life expectancy among both men and women. In 1999 12.4 percent of the Canadian population was sixty-five years of age or older (Bélanger et al. 2001). By the year 2001, it was projected that this portion will have risen to 14 percent, and with continued declines in fertility, this fraction will continue rising. These are trends common to other Western societies, especially those throughout Europe.\nWith the graying of the population, concerns about the costs of treating an aging population have increased. Recently, there has been a trend to move elder care outside institutional settings, and it has increasingly become the responsibility of informal caregivers, most frequently female family members. Health care services that were previously offered in institutional settings are now being performed in community health centers, day clinics, and people's own homes. This has created a difficult situation for elderly people, especially in rural Canada. Alongside limited formal health care supports in these areas, depopulation, aging communities, smaller family sizes, limited community resources, and volunteer burnout have resulted in fewer informal community supports (Blakley 1999).\nThis, in turn, led to widespread unease that the middle-aged children of elderly parents will be squeezed or sandwiched by the multiple roles and obligations associated with dependent children, elderly parents, and work obligations (McDaniel 2001). Elder care involvement can significantly reduce the amount of time available for other family relationships, as well as for work and leisure; yet research has shown that, so far, this has not occurred among the vast majority of middle-aged Canadians. Few Canadians provide frequent help to their elderly parents (Rosenthal et al. 1996). In fact, until parents reach the age of seventy-five, the flow of support favors the children: they receive more help from parents than they give to them.\nThe majority of Canadian seniors continue to live on their own well into advanced age, and most of the care they receive comes not from their children, but from other members of the same generation, usually a spouse. Friends and neighbors may, however, provide essential help when seniors live alone (Martel and Legare 2000).\nEthnicity influences the amount of assistance provided to older relatives. Asians, East Indians, and southern Europeans provide higher levels of help than British respondents; for example Oya koh koh (filial obligation in Japanese) has a significant effect on nisei (second generation) and sansei (third generation) children's provision of emotional support to older parents in British Columbia (Kobayashi 2000). However, structural factors (like living arrangement and age) rather than cultural factors (like filial obligation) are stronger predictors of assistance and involvement (Keefe, Rosenthal, and Beland 2000). Even among nisei and sansei children, financial and service support are more affected by such material conditions as socioeconomic status, child's availability, and parent's health (Kobayashi 2000.)\nConclusion\nThis chapter has provided an illustration of the diversity of Canadian families over time and space. We have seen that government policies sometimes shape Canadian families, and sometimes people form their families despite such policies. Families grow out of past traditions and new perspectives. Relations within and between families will often differ, depending on gender, race, ethnicity, economic situation, and sexual orientation.\nChanges in Canadian families since the mid-1970s include fewer children, more working mothers, more divorces, and more people cohabitating. Exogamy has increased even among traditional endogamous people such as Jewish Canadians. In many respects, Canadian families are similar to families in other Western societies, such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Households have shrunk throughout the West. Marriages are expressive and companionate, and though they may have an instrumental component, they are not formed for instrumental reasons alone. Women will often leave marriages that do not provide what they require. Family members, generally, are mobile and often distant. Overall, people's lives are more individualized: more fluid, varied, and idiosyncratic (see Jones, Marsden, and Tepperman 1992).\nEnormous diversity has always characterized families in Canada, although the nature of this diversity has changed over the years. Canada has historically been a society of immigrants and a society of regions. The new immigration policy has increased the ethnic mélange of the Canadian population and in so doing dramatically shifted the variety of Canadian families. It also increased exogamy and mixing, leading to the creation of new, blended cultures, in an already multicultural population.\nRoman Catholic 47%, Protestant 36%, Eastern Orthodox 1%, Jewish 1%, Muslim 1%, Hindu, Buddhist\ncurrency:\nCanadian dollar = 100 cents\nFederation in n North America . Canada, the world's second largest country (after Russia ), is thinly populated. Much of the land is too cold or mountainous for human settlement, and most Canadians live within 300km (200mi) of the s border with the USA.\nWestern Canada has the most rugged terrain, including the Pacific ranges and the mighty Rocky Mountains . Mount Logan is Canada's highest peak, at 6050m (19,850ft). East of the Rockies are the fertile interior plains of Canada's Prairie Provinces (s Alberta , Manitoba and Saskatchewan ). This vast farming region is the n extension of the prairies of the United States .\nIn the n are the bleak Arctic islands. The Canadian Shield, in e central Canada, is a vast region of ancient rocks, which covers almost half the country, enclosing the Hudson Bay lowlands. South of the Canadian Shield lie Canada's most populous regions: the lowlands n of Lakes Erie and Ontario and the St Lawrence river valley, including the capital, Ottawa , and Toronto . The northernmost part of the Appalachians are in the se.\nClimate\nCanada has a cold climate, with winter temperatures below freezing throughout most of the country. In the n, along the Arctic Circle, temperatures are below freezing for seven months every year. But Vancouver on the w coast has a mild climate, and average temperatures remain above freezing in winter.\nWestern Canada has plenty of rainfall but the prairies are dry with 250–500mm (10–20in) of rain annually. South-east Canada has a moist climate and Montréal has an annual average of c.1040mm (41in) of rain.\nVegetation\nForests of cedar and hemlock grow on the western mountains, with firs and spruces higher up. The interior plains were once grassy prairies, but today they are used mainly for farming and ranching. The far n is tundra. The se lowlands contain forests of deciduous trees, such as beech, oak and walnut. The Appalachians include beautiful mixed coniferous and deciduous forests.\nHistory\nCanada's first people, ancestors of present-day Native Americans , arrived from Asia c.40,000 years ago. Later arrivals were the Inuit , also from Asia.  John Cabot was the first European to reach the Canadian coast in 1497. A race began between France and Britain for the riches in this new land. France gained an initial advantage when  Jacques Cartier discovered the St Lawrence River in 1534 and claimed Canada for France.\nThe French established the first European settlement in 1605 and founded Québec in 1608. The empire was extended by explorers such as La Salle . French settlement in the w was generally much slower than English development on the Atlantic coast. The French and Indian Wars (1689–1763) were a protracted battle for colonial domination of Canada. In 1713, the province of Nova Scotia was ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht . In 1759, Québec was captured by Britain, and France surrendered all of its Canadian lands in the Treaty of Paris (1763). In 1774 the French-Canadian population of Québec gained territory to the Ohio River, the Continental Congress responded by invading Canada. During the American Revolution , Canada remained loyal to the English crown, and American attempts to capture it failed. In 1784, the province of New Brunswick was created out of Nova Scotia . The Constitutional Act (1791) divided Canada along linguistic and religious lines: Upper Canada (now Ontario ) was English and Protestant; Lower Canada (now Québec) was French and Catholic.\nExplorers such as  Alexander Mackenzie ,  James Cook and  George  Vancouver enabled Britain to form the crown colony of British Columbia in 1858. Border disputes with the USA (see Aroostook War , War of 1812 ) continued into the 19th century.\nLarge-scale immigration from Ireland and Scotland increased tension and conflict between the English-speaking majority and the French-speaking minority. In an attempt to reduce conflict, the British passed the British North America Act (1867). This constitutional act established the federation or Dominion of Canada, consisting of Quebec , Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. In 1869 it acquired the lands of the Hudson's Bay Company and other provinces were added: Manitoba (1870), British Columbia (1871), Prince Edward Island (1873), Alberta and Saskatchewan (1905) and Newfoundland (1949). The Dominion's first prime minister,  Sir  John  A. Macdonald , established the Canadian Pacific Railway, which proved disastrous to his career but provided the means for 3 million Europeans to emigrate to Canada between 1894 and 1914. Canadians fought as part of Allied forces in both World Wars, and in 1949 Canada was a founding member of NATO . Under the leadership of  W. L.  Mackenzie King , national unity was strengthened and industry developed. In 1963,  Lester Pearson became prime minister and, as a sign of Canada's growing national confidence, adopted a new national flag. In 1967, Montréal hosted the influential Expo' 67.  Pierre Trudeau's first administration (1968–79) faced violent separatist demands for Québec's independence, and martial law was imposed in 1970. In 1976, Montréal hosted the summer Olympic Games . In Trudeau's second administration (1980–84), Québec voted to remain part of the federation (1980). The Canada Act (1981) amended the constitution, and Canada became a fully sovereign state with a Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It was approved by all the provinces, except Québec which claimed power of constitutional veto. In 1985  Brian Mulroney and provincial leaders signed the Meech Lake Accord, which provided for Québec to be brought into the constitutional settlement as a “distinct society”. Manitoba and Newfoundland failed to endorse the Accord, and Canada was plunged into constitutional crisis.\nPolitics\nJean Chrétien became prime minister in 1993, and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. A 1995 referendum on sovereignty for Québec was narrowly defeated by 50.6% to 49.4%. Regional differences exist, and experts argue that the reconciliation of the divisions between the e (Montréal- Toronto ) axis and the w (Vancouver- Winnipeg ) axis is vital for Canada's future prosperity. In 2003, Paul Martin became prime minister.\nCanada's new constitution enabled Native Americans to press for land claims. In 1999 part of the Northwest Territories became the Inuit territory of Nunavut .\nEconomy\nCanada is a highly developed and prosperous nation (2000 GDP per capita, US$24,800). Although farmland covers only 8% of the land, farms are highly mechanized and productive. Canada is the world's leading producer of linseed and the second largest producer of oats and rapeseed. Canada's vast conifer forests and the availability of cheap hydroelectric power has encouraged the development of huge wood pulp and paper industries. Fishing is important in both Atlantic and Pacific waters.\nCanada is rich in mineral resources and is the world's leading producer of uranium, potash, and zinc ore. Other major resources include nickel, aluminium, cobalt ore and natural gas. Lesser resources include copper, gold, molybdenum and salt. Canada is also a major producer of petroleum. Manufacturing is highly developed, especially in the cities where 77% of the population live. Canada is a major manufacturer of commercial vehicles. Other products include chemicals, electronic goods, machinery and telecommunications equipment.\nCanada has long been influenced, both culturally and economically, by the USA, and the two countries have the largest bilateral trade flow in the world. Since January 1, 1994, Canada, Mexico and the USA have been linked through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the world's largest trading area, with the aim to eliminate cross-border tariffs within 20 years.\nPolitical map\nThe Oxford Companion to British History\n© The Oxford Companion to British History 2002, originally published by Oxford University Press 2002.\nCanada . A self-governing dominion since 1867, much of Canada was earlier colonized by the British and the French. British interest in the area initially focused not on the land but on the sea. Ships leaving the west country probably located the Grand Banks fisheries even before  John Cabot's explorations of 1497. Despite official discouragement of settlement, Newfoundland became de facto the first overseas British colony, a status it relinquished later than other parts of what would become Canada.\nIn 17th- and 18th-cent. usage, the name Canada referred primarily to the St Lawrence lowlands. Here the British involvement is usually dated from Wolfe's victory on the Plains of Abraham (1759), but this was not the first British attempt to capture the French colony. In 1629 the Kirke brothers seized the small fort at Quebec . The colony was returned to the French three years later. Subsequent large-scale but unsuccessful attacks took place in 1690 and 1711.\nFrom 1670, through the royally chartered Hudson's Bay Company , England claimed sovereignty over Rupert's Land, an area including much of the central plains and northern Canada. The control the Hudson's Bay Company exercised was largely at the sufferance of the native peoples of the area, but the expanding fur trade eventually led the company to set up posts in the far north and on the west coast, establishing British claims to this contested region.\nIn the long-running 18th-cent. conflict with France , the British definitively acquired Acadia , renamed Nova Scotia , in 1713. For some forty years, the British laid few claims to the area. Unable to secure a pledge of allegiance from the Acadian population, British authorities dispossessed and deported them. Nova Scotia was then available for Anglo-American settlement.\nWith the fall of Quebec in 1759, and the 1763 treaty of Paris , British control over the northern half of North America was unrivalled. The attempt to integrate the French, catholic population of the St Lawrence valley into the British empire formed a large part of the political agenda for the next century. A series of constitutions was enacted to address the evolving relationship. The Quebec Act (1774) guaranteed religious freedoms and legal customs, providing greater privileges to the Canadians than catholics enjoyed in Britain . In doing so, it heightened tensions between Britain and its colonies to the south.\nWhen conflict between Britain and its other North American colonies broke out, Nova Scotia, though populated in large part by recent arrivals from Massachusetts, obeyed the military garrison at Halifax. Quebec maintained its allegiance, not necessarily out of love for the British rulers, but for fear of the more radical protestants of the rebel colonies. In the aftermath of the American Revolution , loyalist refugees streamed north to the colonies that had refused to join the rebels.\nThe arrival of the Anglo-American refugees created new exigencies. Nova Scotia was divided into two colonies, New Brunswick and peninsular Nova Scotia. Prince Edward Island had already acquired a separate administration from Nova Scotia in 1769, and Cape Breton Island enjoyed a separate status as a refuge for loyalists for 40 years. In 1791, Quebec was divided essentially along the Ottawa river to create Upper and Lower Canada. Henceforth, Upper Canada contained primarily an English-speaking population.\nThe North American colonies were often more of strategic than economic importance to the British. With the fisheries secured, the colonies served two other main purposes. They provided other primary resources, such as wheat, timber, and minerals. Also, they offered a place for British emigrants. Until the 1810s, relatively few made the rough transatlantic voyage to settle in the British North American colonies. But after 1815, Highland Scots and northern Irish flocked to Canada. These huge influxes of population exacerbated tensions between colonial politicians and the mother country and were important factors in the rebellions of 1837–8 in Lower Canada. In turn, these rebellions suggested to the British government that the attempt to integrate the French-Canadian population into the empire had not been successful.\nA third constitution, the Union Act, tried to address the problems, uniting the two Canadas, in the hope of swamping the French-speaking population. However, brilliant French-Canadian politicians made alliances with reformist English-speaking colleagues to defeat the attempts. The fourth constitution, the British North America Act of 1867, essentially rejected the assimilationist policy, by separating again Upper and Lower Canada, and joining them with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, much to the dismay of many people in the latter two colonies. The four provinces received important degrees of autonomy, within a federal system. This constitution, the longest lasting of all the attempts, has proved the most malleable, and despite increasing tensions since the 1960s, the most successful. But Quebec separatism, as demonstrated by the referendum of 1995, remains strong.\nWith the BNA Act, the name Canada extended to take in the provinces involved. Other provinces and territories were either annexed or joined the federation subsequently: the Northwest Territories through purchase from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1870; Manitoba (1870); British Columbia (1871); Prince Edward Island (1873); the Arctic Islands (1880), Yukon (1898); Alberta and Saskatchewan (1905); Newfoundland (1949). Canada was a self-governing dominion, the ‘eldest daughter’ of the empire. Constitutionally equal in status to Britain according to the statute of Westminster (1931), until 1949 the final court of appeal remained the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, and until 1982 any amendments to the constitution had to be requested of the Westminster Parliament.\nDue to further waves of migration, Canada retained and extended its British character. Between 1902 and 1912 alone, over 1.5 million British emigrants left for Canada. A similarly large proportion of immigrants arrived following the Second World War . In part because of these continuing migrations, cultural and emotional links to Britain in English-speaking Canada remained strong until relatively recently and Canada contributed greatly to the allied war effort in both world wars. However, following the Second World War, Canadian politicians and diplomats have attempted to carve out a separate space in world affairs. For instance,  Lester  B.  Pearson won the Nobel peace prize for negotiating an end to the Suez crisis in 1956 despite British consternation at Canada's role in the matter.\nBy 1994 Canada's population was nearing 30 million. Economically, Canada has at times relied heavily on British markets and investment. Though in slow decline for a long period, since the Second World War trade between Canada and Britain has levelled out at a lower, but not inconsequential, level. As the economic clout of the USA expanded in the 20th cent., so did its influence over Canada. The passage of the Free Trade Agreement in 1989 (and later the North American Free Trade Agreement) recognized and indeed enhanced Canada's continental orientation.\nColin  M.  Coates\nCOPYRIGHT 2004 The Gale Group Inc.\nEnvironment Canada\nCanada 's Department of the Environment, commonly known as Environment Canada, was founded in 1971. It was created to bring the different aspects of Canadian environmental policy, which had until then been split between several different departments, under the control of one main body. Environment Canada has primary, but not exclusive, control of implementing Canada's environmental policies (the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, for instance, still has control of fisheries protection).\nEnvironment Canada has three main areas of responsibility:\nWeather and environmental prediction—collecting environmental data and forecasting weather, as well as researching climate change and other human environmental impacts\nClean environment—developing pollution standards and controlling the use of toxic substances\nNature—conserving biological diversity, primarily through parks and the protection of endangered species\nEnvironment Canada also has responsibility for upholding Canada's end of international agreements, and working with the environmental agencies of other nations on issues of regional or global importance. The Commission for Environmental Cooperation, for example, is an organization established by the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States to address regional environmental concerns, help prevent potential trade and environmental conflicts, and promote the effective enforcement of environmental law.\nIn contrast to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has complete control over the implementation of American environmental legislation, Environmental Canada shares its responsibilities with the provincial governments. However, the distinction between what falls under federal authority and what belongs to the provinces is rarely clear, especially when it comes to environmental protection.\nIn an effort to minimize overlap, the Canadian federal government typically limits its involvement in environmental protection to a few key areas where its constitutional authority is clear and undisputed. Those areas include national parks, aboriginal title lands, inland and offshore fisheries, and issues of \"national concern,\" such as toxic substances and endangered species, and are the focus of Environment Canada's authority. Otherwise, environmental protection responsibilities such as assessments, inspections, and enforcement generally fall to the provinces.\nsee also  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nInternet Resource\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nAn American’s Guide to Vacationing in Canada ... but in true Canadian fashion….let them be. ...

Once your documentation and insurance is in place, there will be nothing left for you to do but pack up your travel gear and make your way to the nearest border crossing.  Look out Canada… here we come!!\nDocumentation & Travel Insurance\nDocuments required to travel to Canada – The following information for U.S. citizens traveling to Canada is cited directly from the Canada Border Services Agency website .\nIdentification requirements for U. S. citizens and permanent residents:\nIf you are a U.S. citizen, ensure you carry proof of citizenship such as a passport, birth certificate, a certificate of citizenship or naturalization, or a Certificate of Indian Status along with photo identification. If you are a U.S. permanent resident, ensure you carry proof of your status such as a U.S. Permanent Resident Card.\nWhether you’re entering by air, land or water, we recommend you carry a valid passport for all travel abroad, including visits to Canada from the U.S. A passport may be required by your airline or alternative transportation authority, as it is the only universally-accepted identification document.\nCitizens of the U.S. who are members of the NEXUS program may present their membership card to the CBSA as proof of identification and as a document that denotes citizenship, when arriving by air, land, or marine modes.\nCanadian citizens who are members of the FAST program may use their cards as proof of identity when arriving by land and marine modes only.\nPermanent residents of the U.S. who are members of the NEXUS or FAST programs must travel with a passport and proof of permanent residence, and may be asked to present these documents to the officer upon arrival at the border.\nAll visitors arriving from or transiting through the U.S. are encouraged to visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website for information concerning the U.S. Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, and the requirements to enter or return to the U.S.\nHow long can I stay in Canada as a visitor?\nThe Government of Canada’s websit e states:\nA border services officer at the port of entry in Canada will determine how long you can stay in Canada. Most visitors are allowed a six-month stay from the day they entered Canada. If the officer authorizes a stay of less than six months, they will indicate in your passport the date by which you must leave Canada.\nIf you want to stay longer than your authorized stay, you should apply for an extension at least 30 days before the authorized end of your stay.\nDo I need additional health insurance?\nIn a word – YES! If you’re thinking, “I’m only going for the day to do some shopping and take advantage of the low Canadian dollar – what could happen? I won’t bother with any additional travel insurance .”  That may prove to be a costly mistake! Traveler’s medical insurance is highly recommended for any length of visit to Canada – yes, even for those day trips. No Canadian health care provider will accept U.S. domestic health insurance, and your Medicare coverage does not extend outside the United States. A visitor to Canada who seeks any medical attention while in Canada should be prepared to pay cash in full at the time the service is rendered – and the costs can mount up quickly!\nPart 1: 5 Top Canadian Cities to Visit\nNow that all the ‘serious’ stuff is in order and out of the way….let’s get down to the ‘fun’ stuff!  This article suggests which Canadian cities should be on your must-see list together with a description of what makes each of these cities special.

Speaking of ‘appetite’….a small ‘taste’ of the cuisine to be enjoyed in Canada was alluded to with the mention earlier of the mouth-watering Japadog in Vancouver. While diverse ethnic food is a big part of the charm of Canadian cuisine, it certainly isn’t the only culinary delights you can experience.\nPart of the adventure of travel….a large part of it for many… is indulging in foods you can’t get at home. Check back here for Part 2 of this 5-part Series on traveling to Canada and discover exactly what constitutes Canadian cuisine, and where you can find the best eats during your visit to our expansive and welcoming northern neighbor!\nPart 2: Canadian Cuisine\nIn Part 1 of this 5-part Series on traveling to Canada , we provided you with a list of 5 top Canadian cities to consider.  Now is a great time to pack up your travel gear and treat yourself to a fabulous vacation north of the border while taking advantage of the current low value of the Canadian loonie (dollar). Right now you will get a much bigger bang for your buck…..as much as 30% in fact….now that’s a great deal!\nA very important and fun aspect of any vacation is experiencing the cuisine of the country or of the different regions within that country.  You may not think that Canadian food is so much different from what you get at home; and, while that is true to some extent, a genuine foodie will have no difficulty finding something brand new to tempt and tantalize your tastebuds in all regions of Canada.\nWhat is Canadian Cuisine?\nAs you travel throughout this expansive country, you’ll soon realize at least a couple of things: 1) Canada is huge…it is larger in area than the USA and, 2) the population is small. The number of people living in Canada is about 1/10 the number living in the US!  The majority of the population lives within a few miles of the US border with the largest number of Canadians inhabiting the cities of Toronto and Vancouver and the surrounding areas.\nAs with any large country, Canada is divided into smaller sections. The nation of Canada is divided into 10 Provinces and 3 Territories. Regions of the country can be separated loosely into:\nthe Far North (Yukon Territory, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut)\nthe West Coast (province of British Columbia)\nthe Prairies (provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba)\nthe largest province (province of Ontario)\n‘la belle Province’ (province of Quebec)\nthe Maritimes (provinces of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick)\nAtlantic Canada (which is comprised of the 3 Maritime provinces PLUS the province of Newfoundland and Labrador)\nRegions of Canada\nWe’ll give you a list of foods native to each section of the country plus a few great restaurant ideas from many of the regions, provided by people who live in these cities…right from the horse’s mouth, so to speak.  We’re pretty sure you’ll find these tempting dishes – some of which are all-Canadian, some which simply are local favorites – will have you and all your travel gear headed in the direction of the nearest airport pronto 🙂  For those regions where we haven’t listed specific restaurants, check out these restaurant apps –   LocalEats , Yelp , and OpenTable – for ideas, menus, and restaurant locations.\nThe Far North\nThe 3 Territories of Yukon, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories are often referred to as the ‘Far North’.\nFoods You’ll Find\nVenison\nGame Meat: Break out your ‘inner caveman’ and dive into a delectable dish of game meat. Popular and plentiful game meats include venison, caribou, boar, bison, and rabbit. You will find these meats in Canadian butcher shops and restaurants, especially in those located in the northern territories of the country.\nFish: If you love seafood, it will be difficult to find any better than what you’ll find in northern Canada. The cold, deep and pristine waters of the lakes throughout the Far North produce superb tasting fish and seafood.  In both Yukon and the Northwest Territories, Arctic char, rainbow & lake trout, pickerel, several salmon varieties, Northern pike and other fish are harvested.  In addition to these fish species, Nunavut also has northern shrimp and halibut.\nPlaces To Dine\nYellowknife, Northwest Territories\nThe City of Yellowknife is small in numbers, with a population of under 20,000, yet offers a surprisingly large number of restaurant choices…ranging from good, all the way to yum!  Foodies will want to try:\nBullocks’ Bistro – there’s really nothing quite like the taste of fresh cod, trout, pickerel or Arctic char caught that day in the depths of the icy cold waters of Great Slave Lake.  Along with the ‘daily catch’….you can enjoy the rude service for which the bistro is well known…and loved. They call themselves ‘the place to be bitched at’ 🙂\nTrader’s Grill in The Explorer Hotel – a fine dining establishment under a chef who gained experience at several 5-star restaurants around the globe, plus has several cooking awards under his belt…or maybe they’re under his ‘toque blanche’:-)  If you’re a total carnivore and love a great steak, this is the spot for you.  Mouth-watering meats on the menu include elk striploin, bison ribeye, a rack of slow-roasted venison.  They also offer fresh fish including Arctic char. And, it doesn’t get much more Canadian than the restaurant’s offering of musk ox steak!\nWildcat Cafe – is one of the oldest restaurants in Yellowknife, operating since 1937.  This informal, friendly and ‘uniquely Yellowknife’ spot operates only during the summer.  Much of the seating is communal – a great excuse to strike up some very interesting and colorful conversations with locals and other tourists alike.\nThe Dancing Moose Cafe – you have to try the bison burger and beet salad here.  Grab yourself a seat with a view out the back of the cafe so you can watch the float planes as they take off and land on Great Slave Lake.\nThe West Coast\nThe province of British Columbia is Canada’s ‘West Coast’.\nFoods You’ll Find\nShellfish\nFish & Shellfish: Whether you’re an angler (love to CATCH the fish) or a foodie (love to EAT the fish :-), you’ll be hard-pressed to find a seafood meal to rival a feast of fish and shellfish found on Canada’s West Coast.  The mild climate and sheltered bays along the coastline make an ideal home for clams, oysters, mussels, prawns, and crabs. The fast-moving rivers and the lakes produce rainbow trout, halibut, white sturgeon, steelhead trout and other great quality fish.  B.C. Pacific salmon is some of the finest salmon you will taste. There are several species of B.C. salmon – Chinook, Coho, Sockeye, Pink, and more…and all types are very tasty. These fish can vary in colour and taste from the Atlantic salmon. You’ll find B.C. Pacific salmon at fishmongers and in restaurants right across Canada. Wild B.C. spot prawns, which are the largest variety of shrimp found on the West Coast, are enjoyed for their firm texture and delicious sweet flavor.\nHealth Conscious Options: Vegetarian, gluten-free, vegan, no-low-carb…whatever your dietary restrictions or preferences…you’ll have no problem finding these foods….in the major cities.  Don’t expect to find as many of these choices in smaller centers but you’ll still find excellent food.\nCabbage Rolls\nEthnic Foods: Whatever flavors you’re in the mood for – Ukrainian, Greek, Mexican, Malaysian, Thai, Afghani, Korean, Japanese, French, Himalayan/Nepalese, Hungarian, East Indian, Italian, Persian, Lebanese, Chinese – you’ll find some or all these foods and more in the larger cities of British Columbia.\nNanaimo Bars: For the sweet tooth in all of us, these dessert bars originated in the city of Nanaimo, B.C. back in the 1950s (or earlier). The best part of these treats is that, while some stove-top cooking is involved, there is no baking required. The bottom layer is a mixture of butter, sugar, cocoa, egg, coconut, graham cracker crumbs, and walnuts.  Butter, cream, icing sugar and vanilla custard make up the second layer, then semi-sweet chocolate melted with butter is smoothed all over the top of this super sweet bar.  It’s takes a bit of time and effort to concoct this confection….but, oh, it is SO worth every minute and…. butter is good for your hair and nails, right? 🙂\nPlaces to Dine\nVictoria, British Columbia\nThis beautiful city is located on the southern end of Vancouver Island – a ferry or plane ride from the mainland.  Excellent restaurants abound to feed hungry tourists and locals alike.\nThe Village Restaurant –  is where Victoria locals go for a delicious and healthy meal. The Village is a great family restaurant that strives to support local organic and sustainable farmers. Their breakfast menu includes delicious items like blintzes with blueberry compote made in house, bennys, and omelets.  And, if gluten is not your friend, 95% of the menu can be prepared gluten-free. What a fabulous find if you suffer from celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or just are trying to reduce your gluten intake. You must try the ‘shakshouka’ – sauteed spinach and poached eggs served over a deliciously simmered tomato sauce – yum!  The Village has been featured on the “food Network” series “ You Gotta Eat Here ”. Check out their episode at  Sooke Harbour House – located about an hour from Victoria, this restaurant serves local, organic, foods in season.  A varied prix fixe 4-course menu, which changes daily, offers delectable culinary delights.  A lovely location to celebrate a special occasion.\nVancouver, British Columbia\nHike, bike, swim, ski, walk the Seawall….there are any number of activities that you can take part in while visiting this spectacular city. Work up an appetite, then enjoy any of the hundreds of cafes, restaurants, food trucks, and patios here.  Some local favorites include:\nCafe Medina – come early, or be prepared to line up with hip locals and tourists, to enjoy breakfast and brunch selections from this varied and interesting menu with a Middle Eastern flair. From the mushroom fricassee, the lamb meatballs, the cassoulet, to the tagine….none of these dishes will disappoint.  Follow up with a steaming cup of lavender hot chocolate or a salted caramel latte.  Add a serving of mascarpone and black pepper honey smeared over a wood stone flatbread…..now you’re going to head back to your hotel room for a nap, aren’t you?…..No, no….you still need to see Grouse Mountain , Stanley Park , Granville Island …….\nSophie’s Cosmic Cafe – visit this restaurant for the cool decor alone!  Artwork, vintage kids’ toys, and collectibles adorn the walls and shelves of this neighborhood favorite.  But do stay to enjoy an order of buttermilk pancakes, a lumberjack breakfast, or any of the other delicious items found on the menu.  Best known for breakfast/brunch, the restaurant also serves dinner which includes wild salmon, a fresh B.C. oyster burger, and perogies.  Order one of their famous milkshakes….or go ‘all grown up’ and order the one with an ounce of sambuca, creme de cacao, creme de menthe, or Irish cream mixed in.  Now that’s not your childhood sodashop milkshake……it’s much tastier than your childhood milkshake 🙂\nThe Prairies\nFrom the foothills and ranch country of Alberta, through the wheat fields of Saskatchewan, to the land of polar bears in the northern part of the province of Manitoba, the Canadian prairies offer so much in the way of outdoor activities, beautiful sunsets, and delicious food.\nFoods You’ll Find\nHigh Grade Beef\nAlberta Beef: The province’s AAA beef is top notch and is considered among the best you’ll find. Alberta is the cattle capital of Canada, and the rancher’s are fiercely proud of the high grade beef they produce.\nSaskatoon Berries: Most Prairie natives have childhood memories of getting sunburned and shooing pesky insects while filling pails with these fleshy-fruited berries to fill a pie or to make jams and jellies…even dessert wine. At the end of the day, hands and mouths were purple from eating nearly as many berries as went into the bucket! Saskatoon bushes grow from western Ontario in the east to British Columbia in the west to the Yukon in the north; however, they’re especially precious to the people who live in the city that shares their name – Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The Saskatoon berry industry has grown exponentially over the years, and is now the second largest fruit crop grown for commercial purposes on the Canadian Prairies, second only behind strawberries.\nButter Tarts\nButter Tarts: Butter tarts are a truly Canadian treat. These tender, shortbread-like pastry shells – with a gooey filling of butter, sugar, syrup and eggs spilling over the edges when baked –  have been making mouths water in Canada since the early 1600s.  Some people add currants or raisins, pecans or walnuts to these tasty little morsels, but no matter what you add, the original custardy toffee taste shines through.\nBannock: Traditionally, bannock is a Scottish flatbread that was gladly and successfully adopted by Canada’s Inuit peoples and other aboriginals throughout North America. Today, this bread, once considered lowly, has risen….no, not ‘risen’, as it contains no yeast :-)…but it certainly has been ‘lifted’ to take its place in the gourmet ranks.\nPlaces to Dine\nWinnipeg, Manitoba\nFun fact: The City of Winnipeg is the geographic center of both Canada and North America. Who knew??  Well….now you do 🙂  It is a culturally diverse city with emphasis on the arts.  There will be more about that in Part 3 of this 5-part series. Just one of the many dining establishments you’ll find in this fair city is:\nStella’s – with several locations in the city of Winnipeg and more opening soon, Stella’s is a local favorite for their all-day breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The breads, soups, and jams are all made in-house as are the chutneys and special spice mixes. Stella’s Mexican-style breakfast is a big hit or try the smoked-salmon breakfast, salmon benedict, or local, grass-fed beef chili or burger.  The delicious breads, buns, muffins, and other pastries are all from their own bakery.\nThe Province of Ontario\nThe largest province in Canada, Ontario is diverse in resources, activities, and food.  The nation’s capital city, Ottawa, is located here as is Canada’s largest city, Toronto.\nFoods You’ll Find\nBeaver Tails | Source: beavertails.com\nBeaver Tails: Over 30 years ago, the Ottawa-based company ‘BeaverTails’ came up with the brilliant concept of hand stretching pastry to the shape of a beaver’s wide and flat tail, frying it, and topping it with sweet confections. The original idea of frying up dough was conceived in Europe, but giving it the all-Canadian name of “BeaverTails” and further smothering the pastry with delectable toppings like chocolate, fruits, whipped cream, and cinnamon sugar proved to be a major hit in Canada.\nPlaces to Dine\nOttawa, Ontario\nThe national capital city of Canada is steeped in history and Canadian culture. Take a walk beside the Rideau Canal (you can skate on the Canal in winter). The city is particularly beautiful when the leaves clad themselves in autumn finery – brilliant golds, reds, oranges, and yellows transform trees and shrubs into veritable fireballs of color!\nEl Camino – While not exactly ‘all-Canadian’ (it’s a Mexican restaurant :-), this restaurant has a ‘cool atmosphere’ and is a fun place to dine. They serve delicious Mexican food – from ox tongue taco, to chili lime caramel pork belly, and crispy prawn betel leaf – and have a great selection of cocktails, wines, and beers.\nLuxe Bistro – Located in busy and hip Byward Market, the Luxe Bistro is the place to go for great steaks when you visit Canada’s Capital City. Great food…great service.\nToronto, Ontario\nCanada’s largest city offers so much to see and do.  You’ll find any number of restaurants catering to your every taste.  Toronto is a definite must-see for foodies!\nTea-N-Bannock – A Taste of Aboriginal Canada – try the bison burger, or the elk-venison stew…and the bannock, of course.\nBannock\nBar Raval – an amazingly beautiful restaurant/bar featuring a Spanish-themed menu. You have to see the interior – the use of woods throughout is quite jaw-dropping.  Kind of a childhood tree house that has matured 🙂   Hugely popular…so expect to wait a while to get in as they don’t take reservations.\nTerroni – a great spot for pasta and thin-crust pizza.\n360 Restaurant – a revolving restaurant at the top of CN Tower. Spectacular views, great food, attentive service.\nO.NOIR – dining as you’ve never before experienced it.  The restaurant is totally dark – don’t even think of using your cell phone or its built-in flashlight.  The idea behind this concept is that when you can’t see your food…all your other senses kick in to provide you with a heightened sense of smell and taste.  The darkness also provides you with some insight into what it is like to be blind or visually impaired – as are all the servers in this restaurant.  Truly a unique experience!\nLa Belle Province – Quebec\nFoods You’ll Find\nTourtière\nTourtière:  This traditional Québécois meat pie is customarily served as part of a Christmas meal, but chances are if any French Canadian is feeling a little ‘bleu’, they’ll seek out tourtiere as their ‘go to’ comfort food. These ‘tarts’ can be stuffed with only finely ground pork, veal or beef, or a combination of those meats. The ground meat is generously seasoned with cinnamon and cloves –  and topped with a dollop of ketchup when served.\nSplit Pea Soup: This delicious ‘stick to your ribs’ hearty soup combines a base of dried yellow split peas and a ham bone, or smoked ham hock.  A must have during the cold and snowy Canadian winters, particularly in Quebec.\nMaple Trees | Maple Syrup\nMaple Syrup: You probably know (or at least….you SHOULD know) that the maple leaf adorns the Canadian flag. But did you know also that the province of Quebec is the largest producer of pure maple syrup with nearly 85% of the world’s supply coming from this region?  Maple syrup is most commonly used as a tempting topping for pancakes, waffles, and French toast, or as a flavor for icing on donuts.  The maple flavoring also combines superbly with the taste of Canadian back bacon – yum!\nPoutine: Take a generous helping of piping hot French fries, add cheese curds, and cover it all with gravy…..you’ve just made poutine! This classic Canadian treat is said to have originated in Quebec back in the 1950s. Today, you can find poutine served in many weird and wonderful combinations including gourmet versions that add lobster and foie gras.  Or you may want to ‘heat things up’ with a jalapeno donut poutine…a plate of freshly made mini donuts, add cheese curds, smothered in gravy, and topped with slices of spicy, hot jalapeno peppers…”ay yai yai!”\nMontreal Smoked Meat: Oh, the smoked meat you can find in Montreal…drool, drool, drool 🙂 They are famous for their kosher-style smoked beef brisket with special herbs and spices. Stuff the meat into a Montreal bagel, and that’s about as Canadian as it gets.\nThe Maritimes\nComprised of the 3 provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island (PEI), the Maritimes are a charming place to visit.  The people are extremely friendly and welcoming, the scenery is spectacular, and the food is mouth-watering!\nFoods You’ll Find\nRaw Oysters\nLobsters & Oysters: The deep, cold Atlantic waters off the coast of Nova Scotia has some of the most fertile lobster producing grounds to be found around the globe. In addition to these succulent crustaceans, Canadians are lucky enough to have fresh oysters to enjoy year round. Watch the facial expressions of diners as they consume these succulent little beauties….you’ll soon see that their reputation as an aphrodisiac is not without basis 😉 Oysters are plentiful on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Canada, from the Maritime provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia on the Atlantic coast, to British Columbia on the Pacific coast.\nWild Blueberries: Canada is the world’s largest producer and exporter of wild blueberries or ‘lowbush’ berries as they are sometimes called. These tasty, tangy berries are grown primarily in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces.\nP.E.I. Potatoes: The iron-rich sandy, red soil found on Prince Edward Island, is ideal for growing potatoes….really good…world famous potatoes…like Russet, White, Red and Yellow. Prince Edward Islanders know a little about potato growing…they’ve been hoeing and hilling  potatoes since the late 1700s!\nFiddleheads\nFiddleheads: Found throughout the Maritimes, Ontario, and Quebec in Canada, these spiral shoots of fern are best enjoyed fresh during the spring season but can be frozen and consumed year round.  They are a good source of potassium, antioxidants, and vitamin C, and are low in sodium. The small village of Tide Head in the Canadian province of New Brunswick boasts of being the ‘Fiddlehead Capital of the World’…and since no one disputes this claim, the Fiddlehead Capital of the World they shall remain 🙂\nMussels: The mussels from Prince Edward Island are renowned across North America for their sweet taste and tender consistency. They are cultured in the cool waters surrounding this province by suspending them on ropes into the water in mesh bags.  As they aren’t allowed to drag on the ocean floor, the mussels remain free of grit and sand often associated with this tasty crustacean.\nAtlantic Canada\nFoods You’ll Find:\nSnow Crab\nSnow Crab: Also called Queen Crab, this shellfish flourishes in the deep, cold waters on the Newfoundland and Labrador Shelf, Cape Breton Island, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  Canada, being the largest producer of snow crab, provides two-thirds of the entire world supply.\nAnd….Canada Wide\nCanadian Peameal Bacon: Canadians LOVE their bacon. Whether it’s the regular fatty strips of bacon, the sumptuous leaner ‘Canadian bacon’ (which is first cured in a brine and then smoked), or ‘peameal bacon’ – which is cured in a sweeter brine and then rolled in ground peas or, more commonly now, cornmeal – you’ll have no problem to find one or more of these bacons in any Canadian breakfast joint.\nLast but not least…Canada Dry Ginger Ale.  We know, we know…you can get ginger ale anywhere… but it’s not all from Canada Dry. Sip this refreshing beverage straight up or mix it with some Canadian Club premium ‘whiskey’….affectionately known simply as ‘C.C.’…..and you’ll soon realize what all the fuss is about!\nOnce you’re well-fed and ready for more fun….check back with us for the next article in this series.  We’ll provide ideas for shows, festivals, galleries, Canadian artists and entertainers, and more on the Arts & Entertainment scene happening across Canada.  You’ll be even further convinced to make a trip across the border and take advantage of all Canada has to offer….and at a ‘discounted’ rate due to the value of your US dollar!\nPart 3: Canadian Arts and Entertainment\nIf you’ve been following along with our 5-part Series on traveling to Canada, you now know a little about 5 of Canada’s major cities , and we’ve given you a glimpse into Canadian cuisine and the delectable foods you’ll find all across the country.  Are you still drooling over thoughts of a scrumptious butter tart…..maybe a sweet Nanaimo bar…an order of poutine, or a bucketful of freshly steamed mussels?  If you’re unfamiliar with any of these culinary delights, have a look at our previous article in this series.\nIn Part 3, we’ll examine the Canadian Arts & Entertainment scene. If you’re thinking, “With all the snow and cold up there, people probably just stay home a lot – probably not much in the way of an arts and entertainment scene” – you would be mistaken….sorely mistaken 🙂\nSure, most of Canada gets cold and snow during the winter….sometimes during the autumn and spring, too :-)….but it also has glorious long, lazy summer days, crisp and colorful autumns, and springs that just make you want to close your eyes and breathe in the fresh spring air with a hint of winter still in its grasp.  Any season is a good time to get your travel gear in order and head north of the border.\nThe breathtaking scenery throughout the breadth and depth of this beautiful country long has held inspiration for artists, sculptors, artisans and craftsmen, and the resulting works are spectacular. Any city you visit while traveling to Canada will have art galleries, museums, artisan shops displaying talents of local, national, and international artists, live music and live theater – again representing both local and global talent.\nCanada also produces amazing talent in the music, TV, and film industries – both in front of the mike/camera and behind the scenes.  From pop stars Celine Dion, Natalie Furtado, Avril Lavigne, Shania Twain, Justin Bieber, and The Weeknd, to TV/film stars Donald Sutherland, Kim Cattrall, ‘the 2 Ryans’ – Reynolds AND Gosling, Rachel McAdams, Neve Campbell, Sandra Oh, Josh Jackson, and Seth Rogen, Canada keeps churning out exceptionally capable stars.  And, maybe there is ‘something in the water’ in Canada that allows it to create phenomenal comedic talent that includes Howie Mandel, Martin Short, Jim Carrey, Andrea Martin, Dan Aykroyd, Mike Myers, Catherine O’Hara, and the late, great John Candy.\nFrom the west to the east to the northern coasts, following is a brief description of what you’ll find in the way of ‘Canadian Arts and Entertainment’ including art galleries, museums, live theater and more.\nThe West Coast – Arts & Entertainment\nVancouver Art Gallery (VAG) – Vancouver, BC\nPlan to spend a couple of hours at the VAG , exploring the permanent collection and the traveling exhibits.  A great way to see what is housed in the gallery, at least the highlights, is to sign up for a complimentary one-hour tour.\nProminently and proudly displayed are the works of one of British Columbia’s most prolific and famous artists, Emily Carr .  Emily Carr was influenced greatly by local indigenous people and that impact is directly reflected in her painting style.\nThe close ties between Asia and Vancouver offer Vancouver the opportunity to act as a gateway to North America for Asian art. VAG has begun to center its focus on Asian-themed exhibits with emphasis on works from Korea, China, Japan, and India.\nBill Reid Gallery of Northwest Coast Art – Vancouver, BC\nBill Reid was one of Canada’s greatest artists. Well known around the globe for his detailed and compelling sculptures, one of which – “The Spirit of Haida Gwaii” – graces the Canadian Embassy in Washington, DC, Bill Reid was also a master carver, a prolific writer/poet, and a goldsmith.  The beginning of his long, successful artistic career began with designing and producing jewelry. With a Haida mother and European father, Bill Reid became especially fascinated with the art traditions of the indigenous people of the northwest coast of British Columbia and he played an integral role in launching these unique talents to the world.\nThe Jade Canoe – Bill Reid\nBard on the Beach – Vancouver, BC\nSeeing the tents rise at the edge of the water in Vanier Park is a highlight of the summer for many locals and tourists. Every summer, Bard on the Beach selects several Shakespearean plays – some tragedies, some comedies – to perform for audiences from around the globe.  Some are performed in their original settings. Some are given a modern twist and modern costumes and are a blast to watch – Love’s Labour’s Lost done up to include jazz, rum runners and a speakeasy?  Comedy of Errors performed with a steampunk theme – too fun!!  Under the expertise of Founding Artistic Director, Christopher Gaze, the productions are truly professional, the actors expertly trained, the costumes phenomenal.  With a natural background (not a backdrop) of local mountains and the Pacific Ocean out the back of the ‘big’ tent, this event is worth a visit.  You can book tickets online in advance, and should…as many performances sell out immediately!\nVancouver Folk Music Festival – Vancouver, BC\nHeld at stunning Jericho Beach Park on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, the Vancouver Folk Music Festival has been an integral part of summertime entertainment and fun in Vancouver since 1978. While the moniker remains “folk” music festival, artists from many music genres now perform here – hip hop, pop, blues, beats, and bluegrass, West African rock, ‘a little bit of soul, yeah, a little bit of soul’….oh, and, folk, of course 🙂 Past performers at this weekend festival have included the late, great folk artist Utah Phillips, indie pop singer songwriter Feist, rock singer Aimee, and long time fan favorite, Ani di Franco.  Shop at the Artisan Market, enjoy the local food. There is also a Little Folks Village to entertain the children with arts and crafts, face painting, they even can collaborate to create a song and get to perform it live….how exciting is that?  Little Folks Village doesn’t provide ‘child care’ service, though, so adults must accompany the little ‘folks’.\nFolk Festival\nFor more check out  Hello BC’s site –  Arts, Culture & History and Attractions & Entertainment .\nThe Prairies – Arts & Entertainment\nCraven Country Jamboree – Craven, SK\nIf you love country music, you’ll love the Craven Country Jamboree !  Located in the beautiful Qu’Appelle Valley, roughly 25 miles northwest of Regina, SK., this small town is transformed into a small city of campers in RVs and tents at Jamboree time!  You can purchase a 3-day pass and get ready to par-tay with thousands of other fans – yee….haw!  Or, get a day pass if hunkering down with a bunch of party animals isn’t your cup of tea 🙂  The Jamboree offers an amazing lineup of talent for the entire weekend with a superstar headliner closing out the show on Sunday night.\nWinnipeg Art Gallery (WAG) – Winnipeg, MB\nThe WAG houses an impressive range of historical, modern, and contemporary Canadian art dating from the early 1800s through to present day.\nIn the historical Canadian collection you’ll see works from artists such as Paul Kane – an artist/explorer famous for his paintings of First Nations people in Western Canada, Frederick Verner – famous for his landscape and scenery paintings of the Canadian plains, and Mary Riter Hamilton – most noted for her paintings of the French battlefields of World War I, documenting the important role Canada’s military played in the successful outcome of the Great War.\nThe modern Canadian art display includes many works of national historic significance.\nPreeminent among these displays is an extensive collection by one of Canada’s acclaimed artists, Lionel LeMoine (L.L.)

The Gallery strongly supports regional, national, and international artists by hosting a number of exhibitions every year.  Drop by their gift shop for something unique for yourself or as a gift for someone at home.\nStratford Festival – Stratford, ON\nAs expected….a city named for the Bard’s hometown definitely should offer live theater…and Stratford does 🙂  Four different stages offer up a plethora of theatrical pearls from comedies, family plays, musicals, modern themes….to, of course…Shakespeare.  Plays run from April through the end of December. Check out their website , choose something that appeals to your individual taste, and prepare to be entertained!\nToronto International Film Festival (TIFF) – Toronto, ON\nSecond only to the Cannes Film Festival in the number of films premiering and the stars who attend, TIFF transforms Toronto annually into a prime location for ‘stargazers’ and film junkies.\nRoyal Ontario Museum (ROM) – Toronto, ON\nROM is the largest museum in Canada and one of the largest throughout North America.  The permanent exhibits and those brought in for extended stays, attract over a million visitors every year!  Well worth a visit to check out the art works and the displays and exhibits on natural history and world culture.\nThe National Ballet of Canada – Toronto, ON\nMy feet hurt after watching a ballet troupe spend an entire performance, for the most part, on the tips of their toes – imagine what theirs must feel like!  But how moving it is to see beautiful, lithe, classically trained dancers in tights and tutus performing traditional ballets. Founded in 1951, ROM is not the only ballet company in Canada, but it is the largest troupe and is the only Canadian ballet company to present a full range of traditional classics including The Nutcracker, Romeo & Juliet, Swan Lake and La Sylphide. The National Ballet School is separate from but closely connected with the National Ballet of Canada. Graduates of the School include actor Neve Campbell and prima ballerina, Karen Kain, who currently holds the position of Artistic Director with the Company.

The gallery selects collections which best reflect the rich mosaic that is Canada’s heritage and culture.\nFor more check out Ontario Travel .\nLa Belle Province (Quebec) – Arts & Entertainment\nMontreal Museum of Fine Arts – Montreal, PQ\nThis art museum has even more visitors each year than the ROM in Toronto (which has more than a million)!  For no admission charge, you can browse through Canadian paintings, drawings and prints in the museum’s permanent collection.  There is a charge for admission to view the major shows which frequently are brought into the museum for a limited time.\nThe Maritimes – Arts & Entertainment\nConfederation Centre of the Arts – Charlottetown, PEI\nThe Centre is Canada’s official memorial to the country’s founding fathers. There is plenty to see both outside and inside the four buildings comprising the Centre of the Arts. Attend a live show performed in the amphitheatre over the noon hour.  Stroll around the grounds and take in the public works of art displayed.\n“The Story of Confederation” located inside the Centre, includes a replica of the Confederation Chamber where, in 1864, members attending the Charlottetown Conference discussed plans to create the country of Canada. Take a walking tour with the Confederation Players, actors portraying men and women of the 1860s, to learn more about how Canada came to be.\nThe Confederation Centre Art Gallery houses historical artifacts and contemporary art exhibits showcasing Canadian works by Canadian talent.\nWhile visiting the Confederation Centre of the Arts, why not take in some live theater as well.  Maybe you’ll be fortunate enough to be there when Anne of Green Gables – The Musical is being performed.  After all, Prince Edward Island is the home of this famous red-haired fictional character .\nA Ceilidh (pronounced kay’-lee) – Halifax, NS\nCanadian Maritimers love making music!  They also love to dance, sing, ‘eat, drink, and be merry’ 🙂 The heritage of many people of Nova Scotia has its origin in Scotland and Ireland.  To this day, Haligonians (yes, that’s what folks from Halifax are called 🙂 pay tribute to their Gaelic roots and culture with Ceilidhs.  The Free Dictionary defines a ceilidh as “a social event at which there is Scottish or Irish folk music and singing, traditional dancing and storytelling”.  You can expect to hear musicians playing the fiddle, bagpipes, and other instruments.  As with any ‘social event’, food plays a large role in a ceilidh, too.  Throughout the summer and autumn months, many local restaurants host lunch or evening ceilidhs.  Enjoy the music, chow down on some seafood chowder or a lobster sandwich, down a pint or two…. before long you’ll be up on the dance floor doing an Irish jig….yelling “Kiss me…I’m Irish”  🙂\nCanadian Awards Shows – Arts & Entertainment\nThey may not have the international appeal of the Oscars or the Grammy’s….but for those involved in the Canadian Arts & Entertainment scene, these 2 awards shows are a very big deal!\nCanadian Screen Awards\nAwards for excellence in Canadian film and TV – in front of the camera and behind the scenes – are presented at a star-studded red carpet gala event . Categories honored include Canadian news, sports, documentary, comedy and drama.\nJuno Awards\nCelebrating everything in Canadian music, the Juno Awards are televised annually and honor the many talented musicians, performers, and songwriters across the country.\nFun For All\nSo you see…..across Canada, people don’t just sit at home, even during the winter months 🙂  There is way too much to see and hear in the Canadian arts and entertainment scene – definitely no time for hibernation – they leave that to the grizzly bears!  Whether you prefer art galleries, museums, live theater, live music, the opera, or the ballet, you will find all of these events all across Canada.  Check the tourism web page for the specific Canadian province or territory you wish to visit for a full listing of ‘what’s going on?’\nNot only is there lots to ‘see and hear’…there is also plenty to ‘do’ in Canada in any season.  If you’re looking for outdoor adventure, Canada will fit the bill easily!  Our upcoming Part 4 of our 5-part Series on Canada will give you some great ideas for outdoor adventure. Answer that call of the great outdoors, pack up your travel gear, and head to the ‘Great White North’….which actually is white only part of the year 🙂  Amazing adventures await you!\nPart 4: Canadian Outdoor Adventure\nIf you’re traveling to Canada this summer and are looking for outdoor adventure, your activity options are virtually endless.  Things to do outdoors run the gamut between ‘easy like Sunday morning’ and…. ‘Are you crazy?? I’m not doin’ that!’\nNo matter to which part of Canada your travels take you – the coasts and oceans, the prairies, the mountains – this country is made for outdoor adventure!  Here are some ideas of what you can do on the water, in the mountains, in the valleys, on the trails, and elsewhere.  We’ve added a few that will make even adrenaline junkies sit up and take notice 🙂\nTop 5 Canadian Outdoor “Mountain” Adventures Outdoor – ‘Ain’t no mountain high enough’…\nMountain Climbing\nMountain climbing – If you want to get high….up into the mountains, that is :-), or prefer to keep your feet a little closer to terra firma, Canada has mountains of all heights for any level of mountaineering.  Scale the peaks of the Stawamus Chief, lovingly known by locals as simply “The Chief”.  Situated near the town of Squamish about an hour north of Vancouver, this intermediate hike has the reward of spectacular views once you have reached the top.  There are marked trails, ladders, and stairs to assist you with your climb up the nearly 2,000 foot mountain side…but there are also narrow ledges and steep inclines to challenge you.  Before you begin your ascent, be sure to visit beautiful Shannon Falls, which is where you will park your vehicle.  There are 3 peaks to climb, and you can conquer all of them in one day, or choose only the South Peak – it also offers fabulous views of the surrounding mountains and the town of Squamish.\nZiplining – Visit Whistler, B.C. and try the granddaddy of them all – The Sasquatch!  This is the longest zipline in Canada and the US and will have you soaring free as a bird above the forests for over a mile! Or book the Eagle tour to ride five different ziplines – all very long rides and all will have you ‘zipping’ along at a pretty good clip.  One of these ziplines is 2,400 feet in length with a 30-storey descent – that’ll have your heart in your throat in short order!  To book or learn more about these breathtaking rides check out their site .\nHang gliding –  You don’t need to pack your Superman cape in your travel gear to do this, but when you’re high up in the air with nothing but the wind beneath you, you’re going to feel like you really can fly!  Unlike parachuting where you are in an upright position (for the most part), while hang gliding, you’re in a prone position and have an even better view….once you’re brave enough to open your eyes, that is 🙂  Whether you’re visiting British Columbia, Ontario, or Quebec, you’ll find places where you can go hang gliding.  For the province of Quebec, have a look at this webpage and book your exhilarating ‘fly like an eagle’ experience.\nMountain biking – Once again, Whistler, B.C., is the place to go for ‘gnarly’ mountain bike runs.  Bring your own bike and gear or rent it there.  The well marked, well traveled bike routes offer everything for the beginner to expert mountain bikers.   Purchase a lift pass to start your ride up high in the slopes and pedal your way down at your own pace.  On at least a few of your runs, take the time to breathe in the fresh mountain air and soak in the spectacular scenery….unless you’re going so fast that it’s all just a blur!\nHiking –  If you’re looking for amazing hikes, with breathtaking scenery, possible wildlife sightings, and fresh mountain air, you’ll find them in the majestic Canadian Rockies regardless of your skill level. In the province of Alberta, guided hikes and less strenuous walks on trails near the mountain towns of Banff, Lake Louise, Jasper and Canmore offer stunning views and are suitable for the beginner and experienced hiker alike. The parks throughout British Columbia are equally spectacular and offer hiking experiences that you’ll not soon forget. Of course, you can strike out on your own. Be certain to let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return.  An even safer and smarter idea is to hire a certified guide to ensure you’ll get the best out of your experience while keeping safe. Day hikes are offered, also backpacking and camping over for several nights is also an option.  Decide what you want to do and get out for your mountain adventure!

Local guest ranches and a number of tour operators can have you ‘saddled up’ and ready to ‘ride off into the sunset’.  The weather in the foothills is unpredictable, so your travel gear should include an all-weather jacket; and, shoes with a solid heel will help keep you mounted.  For more click here .\nCamping – Choose any one of the 10 Canadian provinces or 3 territories for excellent camping.  Provincial and national parks all offer camping spots – some are free, but the majority require payment, depending on the facilities available.  You may need to book a campsite in advance to avoid disappointment, as most Canadians do love to get out into nature every chance they get.\nBicycling – This is another activity that is popular in Canada from coast to coast to coast.  Many major Canadian cities now have bike lanes to make your ride safer.  Both Vancouver, B.C. and Toronto, ON have scenic bike paths on the shores of the local waters.  In Vancouver, there is an extensive network of bike paths along the Pacific Ocean, False Creek, and throughout the city by which you can access many of the popular tourist spots and more!\nSwimming – If you enjoy ‘swimming with the fishes’, Canada will ‘make you an offer you can’t refuse’ 🙂  The rivers and oceans tend to be on the cool side no matter what time of year you visit, but brave souls do venture out into the Pacific Ocean and many of the sparkling rivers – mostly during the lazy, hazy days of summer.  If you prefer to do your swimming in less rugged waters, there are plenty of outdoor and indoor pools as well…but where is the adventure in that? 🙂\nWhale-watching – Whether you choose to travel to the west coast of Canada or to the East coast, plan a whale-watching excursion as part of your vacation itinerary.\nThe best place on the west coast to book a whale-watching excursion is from Vancouver Island. It has some of the best whale-watching opportunities in the world!  If you are fortunate enough to see a pod of orcas cavorting over the waves, or a mammoth humpback breach the surface of the Pacific Ocean, you will be (as the Brits say) “gobsmacked”!  There is plenty of other marine life to keep watch for as well – dolphins, seals, sea lions.  A truly unforgettable experience! For more check out  Tourism Vancouver .\nOn Canada’s east coast, the province of Nova Scotia has great whale-watching opportunities, particularly during the months of July through the middle of October.  The Digby Neck area of the Bay of Fundy provides the whales with a smorgasbord during the summer… and what whale doesn’t like to eat??  The coastal area along Cabot Trail in Cape Breton is another great location to hop aboard a whale-watching vessel. In addition to whales, you may get to see other marine life –  seals, porpoises, and various seabirds. For more click here .\nTop 5 Canadian Outdoor “River” Adventures – ‘Ain’t no river wide enough’…\nFly Fishing\nFly fishing – “Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.  Teach him how to fish and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day.” Who ever said this isn’t owning up to it …but there’s a lot of truth in it 🙂  So many parts of Canada offer fabulous fishing.  If fly fishing is what ‘floats your boat’, head up to the Yukon for some of the very best fly fishing you’ll find in Canada, or anywhere really.   What’s your fancy? Trout, pike, whitefish?  The Yukon has those and many other species of fish in rich supply.  For the better part of the year, the climate tends to be on the cool side (downright cold in winter!), which makes for cold lakes and rivers and very tasty fish.  During the months of June, July, and August there is nearly 24 hours of sunlight every day – plenty of time to fish whenever you jolly well please 🙂\nSalmon fishing – in British Columbia, you can fish year round, with June through September being the best time for salmon fishing. The rivers throughout the province,  plus the Pacific Ocean are home to 5 species of Pacific salmon – Coho, Chinook, Chum, Pink, and Sockeye.  Their outward appearance doesn’t vary too much, but the flesh color varies from species to species,.  There are several major rivers flowing through British Columbia to the Pacific Ocean, including those closest to the Vancouver area, the Capilano River and the Fraser River.   The Strait of Georgia, the body of water which separates the Gulf Islands and southern Vancouver Island from Vancouver and the mainland of Canada, is a feeding ground for much of the salmon population.  If you have a ‘lucky’ fishing rod, add it to your travel gear….or one will be provided for you if you wish to book a charter fishing trip.\nSurfing – ‘Ride, ride, ride the wild surf’….in Canada? Really?  Oh, yes… Tofino, B.C. is Canada’s surf capital, and you can surf here year round! Actually, winter surfing is the best here as that is when the ‘surf’s up’ at its strongest. Whether you’re a surfing virgin, or an experienced ‘surfer dude’, there are waves to catch for everyone in the 22 plus miles of rolling waves and sandy beaches.  The water is cool, so a wetsuit is an  essential piece of travel gear, along with surf-quality boots, gloves, and hood.  If you’re dry and cosy, you’ll be able to catch and ride the waves for longer and, more safely.  Hang ten!\nAnother amazing adventure can be yours at Skookumchuck Narrows on British Columbia’s spectacular ‘Sunshine Coast’.  This unique sport is called SUP Surfing – where you use a stand up paddleboard or a kayak to ride through this wave explained as follows.  “A massive tidal exchange through the narrows between Sechelt and Jervis inlets puts on an impressive daily show, creating the famous Sechelt Rapids and attracting both nature-lovers as well as extreme sports enthusiasts. As 750 billion litres of seawater rushes through Skookumchuck Narrows at speeds up to 17 knots, the force creates a standing wave that can reach two metres in height.” You’ll want to check out this amazing video illustrating just what you can expect from this incredible adventure!\nStand Up Paddleboard Skookumchuck: Greatest ride of my life! from luke hopkins on Vimeo .\nKayaking/canoeing – The province of Ontario offers incredible kayak or canoe opportunities. The landscape through which you can paddle is breathtaking!  Ontario Parks operates over 7,500 interior campsites – many of which you can get to only by canoe or kayak. You can rent canoes and camping equipment at many of the provincial parks.  Local outfitters provide guided trips or can help you plan your own trip.  Check out the Ontario Parks web page at http://ontarioparks.com/en.  Be prepared, follow the rules regarding campfires, wildlife, etc., know the limits of your own abilities, and have a wonderful time!\nWhite water rafting – This one’s for you, Adrenaline Junkies 🙂   Here’s a package that is sure to set your ticker racing!  It combines two of the most thrilling adventures in the Rockies! Start by white water rafting the mighty rapids of the Kicking Horse River…. then experience the exhilaration of jumping from a perfectly good plane at 10,000 ft!   https://www.banffadventures.com/\n5 Bonus Canadian Outdoor Adventures – with a twist\nKayaking\nLooking for something a little unique?  Try thinking outside the box with these activities:\nFlying trapeze class – okay, so this technically isn’t an ‘outdoor’ activity….but a unique one nonetheless!  If you’ve ever had the desire to ‘fly through the air with the greatest of ease’, the Toronto School of Circus Arts offers drop-in classes for you to take!  Defy gravity and challenge your body to reach new heights. It’ll make your next night out way more fun….and safer. When you decide to ‘swing from the chandelier’…you’ll look like a pro 😉\nDogsledding and/or Swim & Kayak with Beluga Whales – these are two other incredible outdoor adventures in the province of Manitoba which you can do even in summer. A visit to the northern town of Churchill is most often done during the winter when both dogsledding and tours to spot polar bears are extremely popular.  If you visit Churchill during the warmer months however, you still can experience the thrill of dogsledding – a cart with wheels replaces the sled – et voila….you’re a ‘musher’!\nOr what would you say to a swim with or kayak among beluga whales during the summer months?  That would be an amazing experience, right?  You can do both here in the Hudson Bay and Churchill River.  Be on the lookout for other wildlife, too.  Caribou and moose, wolves and foxes all call this area home.  You might even be lucky enough to see some polar bears if you know where to look.  During summer months they can still be spotted out on the tundra or along the rocky coastline.\nCable wakeboarding –  Here’s another one for you adrenaline junkies!  Unlike wakeboarding behind a motorboat, in ‘cable’ wakeboarding you are pulled by…well, by a ‘cable’ system. Every extreme trick you can perform while wakeboarding behind a boat, you can do while cable wakeboarding.  A great facility is located in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  Here you’ll find two lakes, one smaller one for beginners to learn the basics of this sport; and a much larger lake where you can hone your tricks, even ‘get air’ if you’re experienced enough.  Learn more about this or book your own thrilling adventure at   Adrenaline Adventures .\nCliff climbing –  Rock climbers from around the world travel to the beautiful Okanagan Valley of British Columbia to tackle the Skaha Bluffs just outside of the city of Penticton. Cliffs range up to 250 feet in height, offering challenges that are suitable for both beginning and advanced climbers.  If cliff climbing is a bit above your pay grade :-), you’ll also find plenty of hiking trails to get you to the top.  The spectacular views of Skaha Lake, the city of Penticton, and a large portion of the Okanagan Valley are well worth the climb.\nZip lines plus – If you want to add a little ‘zip’ to your zip lining experience, you’ll love this adventure!  “The Treetop Adventure Full Course features 70 different obstacles from rope swings to balance beams that reach heights of up to 60 feet above the forest floor. Rise to the challenge and experience the canopy from an elevated perspective.”  Adventure, fabulous scenery, fresh air, and fun all rolled into one awesome experience!  Check them out at Super Fly Ziplines .\n5 Packing Tips for Summertime Canadian Outdoor Adventures:\nOutdoor Gear\nIf your summer activities will include dog sledding and/or swimming with belugas in Churchill, Manitoba – the weather can be on the cool side. Summer temperatures average only between 40 F and 60 F.   Of course, it can get warmer or cooler so best to include these items with your travel gear: a waterproof jacket, hat, sunglasses, hiking boots, shorts, pants, sunscreen, and insect repellent.\nThe weather in the Canadian Rockies can be very unpredictable. Pack clothes that you can layer and you’ll be prepared for whatever Mother Nature throws at you! The sun is strong – sunglasses and a hat will protect you from UV rays – and should be worn no matter what time of year you visit.  In summer, July through September, Rocky Mountain destinations enjoy warm weather… but that can change at the drop of a hat. Be sure to pack a rain/wind proof jacket and a warm sweater.\nTo keep safe your personal and financial information, your travel gear always should include an RFID-blocking wallet or neck-stash whenever you travel.\nIf you plan to surf in Tofino, B.C., a wetsuit is essential, along with boots recommended for surfing, gloves and a hood so you’ll be able to get the most out of your surf time.\nWhite water rafting?  Your travel gear should include a towel and a swimsuit.  DON’T bring a camera (waterproof is okay), expensive jewelry, or other valuables.  Leave those items in your hotel safe or in another secure location.\nLike the song says, “Ain’t no mountain high enough, ain’t no valley low enough, ain’t no river wide enough….to keep you from gettin’ to…Canada this summer…to experience and enjoy any and all types of outdoor adventure!\nThroughout the previous 4 parts in this 5-part Series, we’ve introduced you to 5 of Canada’s top cities , given you some ideas on what constitutes ‘ Canadian cuisine ’ and where to find it, a peek into Canada’s arts and entertainment scene , and now, where to find outdoor adventure.\nDon’t miss the final article in this 5-part Series coming soon.

Select from 3 types of coaches – Business Class, Economy Class and Touring Class. Fares vary according to distance traveled, region of travel, length of journey, and class of service.  You qualify for a fare discount if you are a senior (65+), youth, student, or part of a group traveling together. The purchase of a CANRAILPASS is a more economical way for you to take seven trips in Economy Class within a specified period of time.\nFormal Dinner\nMeal service on VIA Rail trains is in either dining cars or lounge cars.  In the dining car, you’ll be offered formal dining service, often with a five-course meal at dinner time, and a complete menu.  The lounge car provides both snack and meal service. Some trains offer ‘seat service’ where the food is delivered to you at your seat.  You can pop into the bar to enjoy a tall cool one and meet new people.\nIf your passenger train includes a Dome Car, be sure to spend time in the upper level observation dome lounge and take in the panoramic views.  When you’ve had your fill of the amazing scenery, head to the dome car’s lower level for a leisurely cocktail at the bar or for a meal in the dining area.\nTip:  Purchase your ticket in advance of your trip to guarantee a seat on the train you want to take.\nAmtrak & VIA Rail Combined\nPassenger trains operated by the American company Amtrak , connect with Canada’s VIA Rail for travel between these Canadian and US destinations:\nFrom Montreal Central Station:  the Adirondack train travels between Montreal, QC, Canada and Albany and New York City, NY in the USA.\nFrom Toronto Union Station: the Maple Leaf train travels between Toronto, Aldershot, and Niagara Falls, ON in Canada and Buffalo and New York City, NY in the USA.\nThere is also a connection between Toronto, ON and Chicago, IL (via Buffalo).\nFrom Vancouver Pacific Central Station: the Cascades train travels between Vancouver, BC, Canada, and Seattle, WA, Eugene, OR, and Los Angeles, CA in the USA.\nRocky Mountaineer\nRocky Mountains Kananaskis Country, Alberta\nExperience the splendor of the Rockies and the diverse geography of western Canada from the comfort of The Rocky Mountaineer .

And, unlike bus or air travel, you can in fact ‘move freely about the cabin’ 🙂 and into the next coach…the dining car, lounge car and observation cars.\nWired – Free Wi-Fi and plug-ins for your cell phone and laptop are provided.  Download the VIA Rail mobile app for instant access to your train status, boarding pass and itinerary.\nConvenience –  Trains tend to run on time and offer frequent service to accommodate even the most hectic schedule.\nLocation – Train stations are normally located at or near the business and downtown area of the city.  This can be a major convenience when you consider just how much time you would need to spend transferring between the airport and the city center.\nSafety – Statistically speaking, rail travel is the safest way to travel.  If you’re a bit of an ‘aerophobe’ rail travel will get you where you want to go….not quickly, mind you…but at least you’ll be cool, calm and collected at the end of your journey rather than the jittery mess you might be if you had to fly 🙂\nGenerous baggage allowance – NOT all trains permit checked luggage but the rail line will state your luggage allowance during the booking process, on your confirmation email, and again on  your boarding pass.  If your train is equipped to handle checked baggage, you may check a maximum of 2 x 50 (100 pounds) of personal baggage free of charge with every adult ticket purchased for travel in Canada. Two bags can be taken on board as carry-on luggage – 1 personal item (max weight 25 lbs) and one larger item (max weight 40 lbs).  No single item over 50 pounds will be allowed as carry-on. Many trains that allow checked baggage also can easily carry sports equipment such as skis, kayaks, and golf clubs. Be sure to confirm this at the time of booking your trip as there may be a surcharge for oversize items.\nExcellent sightseeing – Riding the rails affords you the opportunity to ‘see the sights’ at ground level rather than peering down through clouds at the tiny figures way down on the ground.  Even a road trip by car isn’t privy to the unique views of the countryside that you’ll see from a train. The wide windows and observation decks provide a unique sightseeing experience.  Rail travel across Canada offers superb views of the country’s natural attractions including the majestic Rocky Mountains.\nComfortable sleeping accommodations – Overnight trains are equipped with deluxe reclining sleeper seats with leg rests, trays and lighting.  Some VIA Rail trains have private suites with access to an on-board shower.\nSocial opportunities – Take the opportunity to speak with other tourists traveling with you, often from other countries.  The observation and lounge cars are especially good for starting conversations.  You can chat up your ‘neighbors’ in the area of your seat, too….just make sure they want to chat with you before monopolizing their time 🙂\nPacking Tips for Train Travel in Canada\nbig Horn Sheep\nWhen you travel by train you can take on board way more travel gear than either a plane or a bus allows you.  Of course, there are weight restrictions for your train luggage, too (see #7 above) but they are more generous.  And, keep in mind that if you need or want to take a plane for any leg of your travels in Canada…you don’t want to be carrying ‘everything but the kitchen sink’ and end up getting hit with overweight baggage fees if your luggage weighs too much for air travel.\nInclude in your travel gear a small pillow and blanket if you’ll be traveling overnight and didn’t book a suite.  You can purchase pillows and blankets on board, and they will be provided if you have paid for a suite with a bed; but, since your luggage allowance is not too restrictive, you may as well take some of the comforts of home with you.\nYou’ll want to get out and get some fresh air at scheduled station stops.  Pack a rain/wind-proof jacket that you can throw on as you disembark.  Some of the stops –  especially through the Canadian Rockies – will be downright brisk!\nBinoculars will come in very handy – at your seat, of course…but especially when you’re in the dome car with its panoramic views.  With the help of binoculars, you just might spot some wildlife or birds that you would not otherwise be able to see. And…if you ‘ooh and aww’ enough while you’re using them… you can pick up a couple of bucks by renting them out to other passengers who think they’re missing out on something 😉\nTake along a camera to capture some spectacular memories as you roll across this incredibly beautiful and picturesque country.\nWe hope you have enjoyed your ‘exploration’ of Canada through this 5-Part Series.  If there are other subjects on Canada you would like to have more information about, please let us know – we’ll be happy to add more articles about things to see and do when traveling to Canada.\n\n"
