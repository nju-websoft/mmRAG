These  aquatic plants appear in many shapes and sizes.  Some have leaves that  float on the water surface,while others grow completely underwater. In  moderation, aquatic plants are aesthetically pleasing and desirable  environmentally. Their presence is natural and normal in lakes, and in fact they  are an important link in a lake's life system. In large quantities, plants can  interfere with some water uses and may be seen as a problem.\nWhen lake users are confronted with too many plants in the wrong places, a  common reaction is to remove the entire problem. Such hasty decisions are often  made with little regard for the important role plants play in the water  environment. Neglecting to see these interrelations often results in unintended  impacts to wildlife, fish, and other forms of life. Unfortunately, the  information required to make environmentally sound decisions is not always  easily available. Without this information, how can anyone know what is best  over the long term to do about aquatic plants?\nThe purpose of this information is to provide some general but pertinent  information and insights regarding aquatic plants:  (1) how they came to be  where they are, (2) what beneficial contributions that they make to life in the  lake, (3) how our activities can affect them, and (4) some things to consider if  plant removal is planned.\nAcknowledgments:\nThis information was taken from a brochure called About Aquatic Plants written by the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle's (METRO) Water Resource  Section (now King County).\nLife History of a Lake\nA question frequently raised regarding aquatic plants is why some lakes have  them in abundance and others do not. An answer to this question lies in the  explanation of the lake's aging cycle.\nMost of our local lakes came into being as a result of activity of glaciers  in the most recent ice age, approximately 10,000 years ago. A lake bed is a  natural depression or low spot in the terrain. In the Puget Sound lowlands they  were often gouged out by movement of glacial ice. These depressions then became  holding basins for water of the drainage area as it flowed toward sea level. As  a lake detains water on its way downstream, it also becomes a settling pond for  sediment.  Part of the sediment that settles in lakes is carried in by the  flow of streams or other runoff, and part comes from the accumulation of the  remains of organisms in the water and near the shoreline. Aquatic life includes  visible plants and animals and also multitudes of microscopic plants and animals  that can, over time, add significantly to the accumulation of sediment in the  lake by dying and settling to the bottom. The microscopic plants in the water  are nourished by plant nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) that originate in the  watershed and are washed into the lake. Within the lake, a portion of these  nutrients can be recycled indefinitely, while more continue to be washed in from  the lake basin. Over time sediment accumulates in the lake as productivity  gradually increases.\nWhen first formed, many of the lake beds were deep and clean (mostly free of  sediment). Sediments that were first deposited were silty and had little organic  material because there was little life in or around the lakes. Over time,  hundreds or thousands of years, the sediment deposits became deeper and more  favorable to the growth of rooted, aquatic plants (macrophytes). As these plants  (and the microscopic life in the water, now also more abundant) died back at the  end of each growing season or life cycle, they enriched the sediments with  organic material. Since macrophytes tend to grow better in organically richer  sediments, this process set up a cycle of more growth in the lake causing richer  sediments and these in turn favored even more\ngrowth of macrophytes\nAs both microscopic and rooted plants continue to grow in increasing volumes  and to enrich the bottom sediments of the lake, the lake ultimately fills in  with silt and partially decomposed plant and animal material, forming a wetland  and eventually a meadow. This occurrence marks the end of a lake's life.\nA lake's life generally extends over several hundreds or thousands of years  under natural conditions. It can, however, be significantly shortened by human  activities such as improper construction practices that disturb the soil and  make it susceptible to erosional processes. As erosion increases in the  watershed, quantities of sediment transported to the lake also increase.  Consequently, the lake fills in faster and its life expectancy is reduced. The  rate at which the process occurs varies with the size, shape, and flushing rate  of the lake. Human beings introduce to the watershed nutrient-rich materials  such as fertilizers and wastes. Installing hard surfaces (roofs, roads,  pavement) makes it easy for these nutrients to be washed into streams and lakes.  These activities boost the continuing production of organisms that contribute to  the filling of the lake as they die and become part of the organic sediment that  favors macrophyte growth.\nLake Aging and Macrophytes\nAquatic plants are an integral part of the lake and its aging process.  Although they may appear in deep, clear lakes, they generally grow most  abundantly in shallow, productive lakes---old lakes that have accumulated thick  sediments. An abundance of aquatic plants represents a sign of middle or old  age.\nConditions that favor macrophyte growth are fairly well documented. Many  observations and studies have shown that conditions favoring their growth  include an accumulation of organically enriched sediment and water that is  shallow enough and  clear enough for sufficient light to penetrate to the  bottom. Algae, silt, or a natural amber or brown color in the water can  interfere with transparency. Of course, the temperature range has to be  acceptable to the plants, and there has to be enough  stability in the  sediments to permit plants to gain a foothold. Thus, the near-shore area cannot  be too steep.\nAlthough considerable research has been done to determine specific  characteristics of sediment and water where macrophytes grow, many fundamental  questions remain unanswered. However, it has been documented that macrophytes  are able to get most of their nutrition from the sediment and can grow  abundantly even when the lake water is not high in nutrients.\nMacrophytes in a Lake Ecosystem\nIn many lakes macrophytes contribute to the aesthetically pleasing appearance  of the setting and are enjoyable in their own right. But even more important,  they are an essential element in the life systems of most lakes. They perform a  number of\nuseful functions in maintaining the food chain of life in the lake.\nMacrophyte leaves and stems provide a habitat or home for small attached   plants and animals. Some are microscopic in size and some are larger. These   attached organisms are valuable in that they are food for animals higher in   the food chain, for example, fish and birds.  There is a vast variety   of these attached organisms, which are often very particular in their   habitat\nneeds.  The kinds of surfaces available for their attachment will help   determine the kinds and amounts of organisms present. Logs, sticks, and   rocks of various sizes, shapes, and textures provide different kinds of   surfaces.  Different kinds of macrophytes---because they have a variety   of sizes, shapes, and textures of stems and leaves, and because they assume   various positions in the water---also provide different kinds of surfaces   for attachment.\nMany types of small organisms live in the sediment. There are insects   that spend the immature stages of life in the sediments,  leaving when   they become adults. Decomposing plant life provides part of the food supply   for these sediment-dwelling organisms and the emerging insects, in turn, are   food for fish.\nThe submerged portions of macrophytes provide shelter and cover for   small or young fish from larger fish that would feed on  them.\nTypes of plants that extend above the water can provide cover for   waterfowl and their young.\nMany plants can serve directly as food for certain types of waterfowl.\nMacrophytes may have an impact on the amount of floating algae in the   lake.  They can provide a growing surface for an  enormous amount   of algae.  These algae use up a portion of the nutrients dissolved in   the water that might otherwise fertilize; the floating algae and increase   their growth. On the other hand, the macrophytes themselves, as they die   back and decay, contribute nutrients to the water and thus can promote algal   growth.  So in many cases we cannot be sure (without very  specific and detailed analyses) whether removing rooted plants would bring   about more algae growth, or less, or no change.\nMacrophytes as Nuisances\nThus far, we have described how macrophytes are necessary to life as we know it  in lakes. The question then is one of degree: How much plant life is desirable?  Can there be too much? How much is too much? The answers will be different for  different types of lake users and may vary from one lake to another. Some uses  of a lake are more affected by macrophytes than other uses, and some types of  plants interfere with recreational activities more than others do. Generally,  plants are not considered to be a problem unless they interfere with desired or  accustomed uses of a lake.\nSome plants have special capabilities to become very abundant and are thus  apt to become nuisances.  An example of this type of plant is the nonnative  noxious weed Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum).  This  plant:\nHas a broad tolerance in its environmental requirements and is capable   of flourishing under what seems to be difficult conditions and is found in a   wide range of environments.\nIt is a nonnative species and does not have significant natural controls   in Washington.\nIts reproduction and growth habits are very efficient.\nIts highly effective process of vegetative reproduction by    fragmentation enables it to spread rapidly.\nIn milder western Washington, it can overwinter in an evergreen    state and start growing early in the spring before the native plants get    started.\nRecreational boaters unwittingly contribute to the spread of milfoil and  other exotic waterweeds such as Brazilian elodea, by carrying fragments of the  plant on their boats, trailers, or fishing gear to an uninfested waterbody. Some  of these noxious weeds can spread rampantly from even a tiny sprig, creating an  aquatic jungle within a couple of years.\nProblems frequently attributed to the growth of macrophytes in lakes   used primarily for recreation include:\nInterference with recreational activities such as boating, fishing,   water skiing, and swimming.\nProduction of fish populations consisting of many small fish rather than   fewer large fish as a result of the plant's protecting small fish too well   against predators.\nUnsightly and odoriferous accumulations of plant material on the water   surface or beach.\nOxygen deficiencies in the water (perhaps causing death to fish   populations) due to decay of plants and plant respiration.\nAccelerated filling of lakes by accumulation of decomposing plant material.\nMinimizing Macrophyte Nuisances\nThere are several ways (aside from direct control operations in the  lake) that a homeowner and citizen can reduce the chances for macrophyte  problems to develop or worsen.  Since nutrients and sediments influence the  presence and growth of macrophytes, curtailing their flow into a lake is  important.  Preventative maintenance or actions that can be taken include  the following:\nCurtail fertilizer use. Apply no more than the amount recommended by the   manufacturer. Use a phosphorus-free fertilizer on established lawns.\nDevelop lake-friendly landscaping practices.\nMaintain septic tank systems to prevent failures and support enforcement   of laws aimed at preventing construction of septic tanks in unsuitable soil   types.\nPlace garden and grass clippings in areas not draining directly into the   lake.  Allow drainage from this debris to flow over soil or grassy   places so that nutrients from their decomposition can be absorbed.\nUse low-or no-phosphate soaps or cleaning/washing compounds when washing   your car.  If you have a septic tank, use\nlow-or-no phosphate dishwasher detergents.\nAvoid using impervious ground covers (pavement, plastics) that will   cause increased amounts of water to run off your property. More water tends   to transport more nutrients and sediments and tends to cause erosion.\nClean up after your pet.  Animal wastes should be flushed down   toilets connected to a sewer system or disposed of away from the lake.\nKeep livestock away from streams and the lake shore. Animal wastes   introduce nutrients and hooves can cause bank collapse, which leads to heavy   siltation.\nDon't feed the waterfowl.  Canada geese can contribute a   significant amount of nutrients to a lake.\nSupport the adoption of ordinances designed to minimize surface water runoff and unnecessary land clearing during construction.\nBe on guard against introduction of new kinds of plants to your lake by   fragments clinging to boats, trailers, or fishing gear, from aquarium plant   discards, or by intentional ornamental plantings in the lake.\nFind ways to communicate your ideas on how the lake or lakes you are   interested in ought to be managed.  Form a lake association to   communicate effectively with government agencies and other organized groups   about how they feel lakes should  be managed and protected.  In   some cases, these types of organizations have enough authority to share   financial responsibility and thus participate directly in management   activities.\nMacrophyte Control\nIn spite of efforts to control aquatic plants, they may proliferate  along shores and in embayments.  In situations where heavy plant growth  interferes seriously with the use of a lake, the lake users are likely to think  about getting rid of part or all of the plants. Because plants play an important  role in the lake ecosystem any disturbance or removal of them will have an  impact on the lake. This impact cannot be predicted accurately because of the  complexity and differences in physical and chemical conditions and communities  of organisms from lake to lake.\nAlso some effects may be subtle and not recognized immediately. Once a lake's  ecosystem is disturbed, a new balance must be achieved.  What the new  balance will look like or how rapidly it will occur is not always easy to know.  Naturally, there is  less cause for concern if a small portion of the lake  is to be treated rather than a large area.\nAlmost all methods of plant control have direct effects on plant life and  organisms other than the targets of the control program.  Depending on what  is actually done to the lake, these side effects may or may not be extensive or  long-lasting.\nIn cases where macrophyte control is planned, the probable effects of the  proposed program can be predicted to some extent, if the lake is studied so that  its physical, chemical, and biological systems are understood.  Literature  that reports the results of similar treatments on similar lakes can be helpful.  Control methods should be chosen to minimize impacts.  Hand pulling, for  instance, has relatively limited side effects.  However, there will  generally be some uncertainties remaining as to how well the treatment will work  and particularly on how extensive and significant its side effects may be.\nGlossary\nAlgae- Single celled plants, most of which are microscopic. The kinds  referred to here are either floating in the water or attached to solid surfaces  of material in the water, such as rocks, logs, and plant stems and leaves.\nDecomposition - Decay of once-living material that releases back into  the water some of the basic substances the living material was composed of.  For example, decay of plants release plant nutrients back into the water.\nEcosystem - The interacting system of all the living things in a  biological community and all the parts of their environments.\nFood Chain - A succession of organisms starting with algae or other  plants, followed by the animals that feed on them. Next come the animals that  feed on the animals that feed on plants, and so forth. A simplified example  would be algae followed by tiny floating animals that eat the algae; larger  floating animals (still small) that eat the tiny animals; small fish that eat  the larger animals; big fish that eat the little fish; and humans who eat the  big fish.\nHabitat - The environment in which a plant or animal lives.  Different kinds of plants or animals have different requirements for their  habitats and cannot survive in a habitat that provides too few of their required  conditions.\nMacrophytes - Large plants that grow in the water.  Most of the  types we have are rooted in the sediment.\nOrganic - Refers here to material that is living or once was part of a  living organism.\nOrganism - Any plant or animal including those of microscopic size.\nPlant Nutrients - Materials that plants use in growth such as  phosphorus and nitrogen.\nPredators - Animals that prey on other animals, that is, use them for  food.  A particular kind of predator uses only certain other types of  animals as food or prey.\nRespiration - The physical and chemical processes by which an organism  supplies its body cells with needed oxygen and rids itself of waste carbon  dioxide. In some kinds of animals, respiration is also known as breathing;  oxygen is used up and carbon dioxide is given off.  Plants give off oxygen  as a product of photosynthesis during daylight hours.  Plants also respire,  however, and at night when photosynthesis stops, they use up oxygen from the  water rather than produce it as they do during the day.\nSediment - Refers here to lake sediment, which is composed of (1) rock  and soil particles and (2) particles of plant and animal materials.  The  first is the silt portion.  and the second is the organic portion.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n... rivers, lakes, ponds, and oceans. ... wildlife are found in the wetlands.

Georgia's Wetland Treasures.  (Graphic Creations Publication)\nThe major functions and values of wetlands are the following:\n \nThe habitats of numerous fish and wildlife are found in the wetlands.  A great percentage of fresh and salt water fish depend on the wetlands for spawning and nursery grounds.  Wetlands are used by ~80% of all waterfowl for nesting, feeding, and breeding.  Over half on the migratory birds of the South spend at least part of their time en route in wetlands.  Other animals spend some portion of their life in the wetlands for shelter, feeding, or water.\nRockfish\nThe water in a wetland itself serves valuable purposes in the environment.  The functions of water in a wetland are called hydrologic functions.  Water in wetland serves the following functions:\n1.  Flood control\n2.  Buffers the effects of waves on the land\n3.  Controls the amount of erosion\n4.  Stores water that refurbishes the groundwater\n5.  Discharges of groundwater into lakes, rivers, and streams during dry periods\n \n \nWetlands play an important role in maintaining the quality of water of deep water habitats.  Wetlands carry out the following functions:\n1.  80%-90% of all suspended soil that passes through wetlands is trapped by wetland plants.  This function is called sediment trapping.\n2.  Much of the world's oxygen is produced in wetlands by microscopic plants called phytoplankton.\n3.  Wetlands are capable of removing 85%-90% of the nitrogen and phosphorous as water flows through them.  The removal of nitrogen and phosphorous prevents the eutrophication of nearby ponds or lakes.\n4.  Some wetland plants can change the makeup of viruses, certain bacteria, and suspended solids in waste water so that the substances are no longer harmful.\n Phytoplankton\nWetlands also have a socioeconomic function due to the many products for which they are directly or indirectly responsible.  The products are the following:\n1.  Timber\n5.  Fur and other wildlife products\n6.  Food\nWetlands are categorized into five different types based on four different factors:\n         1.  Type of vegetation present\n         2.  Pattern of flooding\n         3.  Chemistry of the water\n         4.  Type of soil\nA brief description of each of the five wetland types will follow:\nMarine:  Includes beaches, bars, and shorelines that are alternately exposed and flooded by tidal action of the open ocean.  This area also includes the \"splash zone\".  Algae is the only characteristic plant of these wetlands.  Marine wetland animals must be able to withstand the crashing waves of saltwater during high tide and the hot sun at low tide.  Some of the animals of these wetlands are the polychaete worm, coquina clam, mole crabs, isopods, amphipods, and sand dollars.\nEstuarine:  Includes wetlands that contain a mixture of both fresh and salt water.  Examples of estuarine wetlands are saltmarshes, brackish marshes, intermediate marshes.  These three are separated by the degree of salt in the water and by the type of vegetation.\n         1.  Intertidal marshes have woody vegetation and are flooded periodically by water\n              that has a salinity of 5 ppt.  This category is composed mainly by the mangrove\n              swamps located Florida and Louisianna.\n \n         2.  Salt marshes occur extensively in South Carolina and Georgia.  Plants are found in\n             distinct zones depending on the type of soil, salinity, temperature fluctuations, and\n             tidal fluctuations.  One of the dominant plants in salt marshes is cord grass.\n \n         3.  Brackish marshes are saltwater wetlands that occur in North Carolina, Florida, and\n              Louisianna.  Brackish marshes form upstream from saltmarshes and contain a\n              higher percentage of freshwater.  The plants of brackish marshes depend on the\n             degree ofsalinity in the area.  Some of the plants characteristic of these wetlands\n             are cord grass, common reed, saw grass, and knotgrasses.\n \n \nCordgrass\nPalustrine wetlands are freshwater wetlands that are dominated by woody vegetation greater than 20 feet in height.  Floodplain wetlands make up the dominant portion of this category.  Trees common to palustrine wetlands are oaks, green ash, sweet gum, ironwood, cypress, water tupelo, willows, water hickory, and maples.\nLacustrine wetlands contain freshwater and border lakes and reservoirs.  They are permanently flooded with water deeper than 6.6 feet and are usually in an area larger than 20 acres.  Plants consist of submersed floating plants and non-persistent emerging plants.  Some examples of lacustrine wetlands are stream levees, beaver dams, limesinks, and barrier island lakes.\nBeaver Dam\nRiverine wetlands also contain freshwater and are contained within a channel of moving water.  They are found along rivers and streams.  Riverine wetlands are permanently flooded and contain the same type of vegetation as Lacustrine wetlands.  Some examples of riverine wetlands are mountain streams, brown water streams, tidal streams, and springs.\nMountain Stream\n \n \nIn his book, My First Summer in the Sierra, John Muir says, \"Every rain-cloud, however fleeting, leaves its mark, not only on trees and flowers whose pulses are quickened, and on the replenished streams and lakes, but also on rocks are its marks engraved whether we can see them or not\".\n(Muir, John.  My First Summer in the Sierra.  California: Sierra Club, 1988.)\n \n \nLet us never underestimate the effect of any aspect of nature on every other aspect of nature.\nAlgae - photosynthetic, plantlike protists important in oxygen production\nAmphipoda - order of crustacean that live in the ocean\nCoquina clam - type of two shelled mollusk\nIsopod - order of crustacean that live on land  ex. rolly polly\nMalaria - a disease marked by recurring chills

use an internet site to determine the location of wetlands within a chosen area.  The internet site will also be used to determine the types of wetlands in the area.  Students will print a colored map that includes a key describing the wetlands in their chosen area.\nThe internet site that will be used to produce the wetlands map is a site produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Digital maps have been made from photographs taken from the air.  Data has not been completed for the whole U.

They get their energy from the sun and make their own food through photosynthesis. In the Great Lakes, producers can be microscopic phytoplankton (plant plankton), algae, aquatic plants like Elodea, or plants like cattails that emerge from the water’s surface.\nHerbivores, such as ducks, small fish and many species of zooplankton (animal plankton) eat plants. Carnivores (meat eaters) eat other animals and can be small (e.g., frog) or large (e.g., lake trout). Omnivores are animals (including humans) that eat both plants and animals. Each is an important part of the food chain.\nIn reality, food chains overlap at many points — because animals often feed on multiple species — forming complex food webs. Food web diagrams depict all feeding interactions among species in real communities. These complex diagrams often appear as intricate spider webs connecting the species.\nThis lesson demonstrates that changes in one part of a food chain or web may affect other parts, resulting in impacts on carnivores, herbivores, and eventually on producers. An example of this might be the harmful effects of pollution. The point that should be made is that when something disrupts a food web, humans should try to understand and minimize the disturbance. Students should also come to recognize that humans, too, are part of this complex web of life.\n \nFood Chains and Food Webs – Parts and Pieces\nFood Chains\nProducers\nPlants form the base of Great Lakes food chains. They’re called producers, because they make their own food by converting sunlight through photosynthesis. They also act as food, providing energy for other organisms. In the Great Lakes, most producers are phytoplankton, or microscopic floating plants. An example of phytoplankton is green algae. Large rooted plants, another type of producer, provide food and shelter for different organisms, fish and wildlife.\nPrimary Consumers\nThe next level in the food chain is made up of primary consumers, or organisms that eat food produced by other organisms. Examples of primary consumers include zooplankton, ducks, tadpoles, mayfly nymphs and small crustaceans.\nSecondary Consumers\nSecondary consumers make up the third level of the food chain. Secondary consumers feed on smaller, plant-eating animals (primary consumers). Examples of secondary consumers include bluegill, small fish, crayfish and frogs.\nTop Predators\nTop predators are at the top of the food chain. Top predators eat plants, primary consumers and/or secondary consumers. They can be carnivores or omnivores. Top predators typically sit atop the food chain without predators of their own. Examples include fish such as lake trout, walleye, pike and bass, birds such as herons, gulls and red tailed hawks, bears—and humans!\nFood Webs\nIn reality, many different food chains interact to form complex food webs. This complexity may help to ensure a species’ survival in nature. If one organism in a chain becomes scarce, another may be able to assume its role. In general, the diversity of organisms that do similar things provides a type of safety, and may allow an ecological community to continue to function in a similar way, even when one species becomes scarce. However, some changes in one part of the food web may have effects at various trophic levels, or any of the feeding levels that energy passes through as it continues through the ecosystem.\nAt the base of the aquatic food web are:\nPlankton\nPlankton are microscopic plants and animals whose movements are largely dependent upon currents. Plankton are the foundation of the aquatic food web. Plankton are vital in the food supplies of fish, aquatic birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals.\nPhytoplankton\nPlant plankton are called phytoplankton and may be single cells or colonies. Several environmental factors influence the growth of phytoplankton: temperature, sunlight, the availability of organic or inorganic nutrients, and predation by herbivores (plant eaters).\nZooplankton\nAnimal plankton are called zooplankton. Zooplankton can move on their own, but their movement is overpowered by currents. Zooplankton may be herbivores or plant-eaters (eat phytoplankton), carnivores or meat eaters (eat other zooplankton) or omnivores, which eat both plants and animals (eat phytoplankton and zooplankton).\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nBlooms occur when colonies of algae--simple ocean plants that live in the sea--grow out ...

What is a red tide? - NOAA's National Ocean Service What is a red tide?\nHome Ocean Facts What is a red tide?\nWhat is a red tide?\nA \"red tide\" is a common term used for a harmful algal bloom.\nVIDEO: Learn about \"red tides\" and human health in this video from the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System® .\nHarmful algal blooms, or HABs, occur when colonies of algae—simple plants that live in the sea and freshwater—grow out of control while producing toxic or harmful effects on people, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and birds. The human illnesses caused by HABs, though rare, can be debilitating or even fatal.\nWhile many  people call these blooms 'red tides,' scientists prefer the term harmful algal bloom. One of the best known HABs  in the nation  occurs nearly every summer along Florida’s Gulf Coast. This bloom, like many HABs, is caused by microscopic algae that produce  toxins that kill fish and make shellfish dangerous to eat. The toxins may also make the surrounding air difficult to breathe. As the name suggests, the bloom of algae often turns the water red.\nHABs have been reported in every U.S. coastal state, and their occurrence may be on the rise. HABs are a national concern because they affect not only the health of people and marine ecosystems, but also the 'health' of local and regional economies.\nBut not all algal blooms are harmful. Most blooms, in fact, are beneficial because the tiny plants are food for animals in the ocean. In fact, they are the major source of energy that fuels the ocean food web.\nA small percentage of algae, however, produce powerful toxins that can kill fish, shellfish, mammals, and birds, and may directly or indirectly cause illness in people. HABs also include blooms of non-toxic species that have harmful effects on marine ecosystems. For example, when masses of algae die and decompose, the decaying process can deplete oxygen in the water, causing the water to become so low in oxygen that animals either leave the area or die.\nScientists at the National Ocean Service have been monitoring and studying this phenomenon for a number of years to determine how to detect and forecast the location of the blooms. The goal is to give communities advance warnings so they can adequately plan for and deal with the adverse environmental and health effects associated with these 'red-tide' events.\nSearch Our Facts\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nWater Biomes . The earth is filled ... organism found in lakes, ... overflow from rivers during heavy rain and prevent rivers and lakes from drying up by dumping ... Water Biomes | The Water Page Water Biomes | The Water Page\nWater Biomes\nWater Biomes\nThe earth is filled with a variety of climates that give life to different plant species. A large area that shares the same weather patterns and plant species is known as a biome. Many experts agree that seven biomes make up our world. Water makes up three-fourths of Earth’s surface and creates two of its biomes: the freshwater biome and the marine or saltwater biome. The freshwater biome includes ponds, rivers, streams, and other bodies of water with little salt in them. The marine biome consists of the oceans, which contain plenty of saltwater.\nPonds and Lakes\nThe freshwater biome consists of many unmoving bodies of water known as ponds and lakes. A pond is a shallow hole where water builds up over time from falling rain. Plants grow around the pond and often spread across the bottom of the pond since the water is still shallow enough for sunlight to reach its depths. Temperature is consistent throughout and the water is still, with no waves. Due to its shallow depth, a pond may freeze solid in the winter or completely evaporate in the summer.\nWhen a body of water grows larger and deeper than a pond, it becomes a lake . Lakes can stretch to thousands of square kilometers in size. Plants survive only near the shoreline because further out the water is too deep for adequate sunlight. Some lakes have waves. The temperature of a lake varies widely from top to bottom.\nMiddle Layer: 8-19°C\nBottom Layer: 4-8°C\nSince a lake is so deep, it cannot freeze solid. The top layer can freeze, however, and cut down on oxygen levels. This causes some plants and animals to die off, known as winterkill. In the summertime the opposite occurs. Algae , a plant-like organism found in lakes, can overproduce and die off in large numbers. The decaying algae lowers oxygen levels and kills off some of the plants and animals, known as summerkill. Summerkill and Winterkill can be a problem for those raising fish.\nRivers and Streams\nMoving freshwater comes in the form of rivers and streams . The bottom of a river is the riverbed and the sides form its banks. Rivers are larger than streams and eventually flow out into the ocean. Combined, rivers and streams make up 3% of earth’s freshwater and help drain excess water away from the land.\nQualities of Rivers:\nMore abundant in areas of heavy rain\nQualities of Streams:\nJoin other stream to form rivers\nKnown as tributaries when they form large rivers\nWhen rivers, streams, and rainfall all flow to a single point where they then empty out into a large body of water, such as a lake or ocean, this is known as a watershed . Watersheds can carry pollution from inland and deposit it into these larger bodies of water. When a river meets the ocean, this point is known as the mouth of the river. It carries soil with it and the soil is deposited at the mouth of the river, where it slowly builds up into land over long periods of time. This new land is called a delta .\nThe last of the freshwater is found trapped inside glaciers. These frozen rivers are located in places such as Antarctica. It is a common misconception that glaciers don’t move, but the opposite is actually true. Though their progress is slow, glaciers found on high ground slowly move down toward the lower ground.\nThe Ocean\nThe ocean covers most of our planet and accounts for 97% of the water found on earth. It provides the fish we catch for food and many of the plants we use in cosmetics and even toothpaste. The ocean also works to regulate the temperature of our air and provides the moisture needed to create rainfall. While the ocean may look smooth on the surface, the ocean floor is actually covered in mountains, valleys, and even volcanoes, just like on dry land. \nOur Oceans:\nPacific Ocean – The Pacific Ocean separates North and South America from Asia and Australia. It is further divided into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean.\nAtlantic Ocean – The Atlantic Ocean separates the coasts of North and South America from the coasts of Europe and Africa.\nIndian Ocean – The Indian Ocean separates Africa and southern Asia from Australia and stretches down toward the South Pole.\nArctic Ocean – The Arctic Ocean is found in the Arctic, the area where the North Pole is located.\nSouthern Ocean – The Southern Ocean encompasses Antarctica at the South Pole. Some argue that the Southern Ocean should not be considered a separate ocean at all, but generally it is included on the list.\nThe ocean is about 4,000 meters deep on average, but it can go quite deeper in some spots. The deepest known point in the ocean is the Mariana Trench . Located north of New Guinea, this trench stretches 2,500 kilometers long and varies in width from 70 kilometers to 338. The deepest point of this trench, called Vitjazdepth, is an astounding 11,035 meters deep. It’s not only the deepest known point in the ocean, but also the deepest known point on the entire planet.\nThe ocean contains varying levels of sodium chloride , the salt we use to season our foods. Salt flows into the ocean from the land. Rain runs through rocks and sand, collecting salt and other minerals on its journey to the ocean. When that water reaches the ocean, it deposits the salt and minerals. When water evaporates out of the ocean, the heavy salt is left behind.\nWetlands\nAreas formed from a mixture of water and land, known as wetlands , occur near rivers and in places with heavy rainfall. Swamps , marshes , and bogs all fall under the title of wetlands. Wetlands are both water and land. While they consist of water, they also have thick vegetation growing in them. Often trees grow out of swamps and animal life is abundant.\nWetlands occur along rivers, streams, and other large bodies of water. When it rains, a river can overflow its banks and fill low-lying areas of land to form wetlands. In dry seasons the wetland may dry up completely. To be considered a wetland , the water must be present for part of the year.\nIn the past, people drained wetlands and filled them in to prevent them from filling with water. More recently people have begun to recognize the wetlands for the natural resources they provide. Many plants and animals call the wetlands home. Birds often migrate from wetland to wetland on their migration path, and some even go there to nest. The wetlands also prevent flooding by collecting overflow from rivers during heavy rain and prevent rivers and lakes from drying up by dumping water back into the river or lake during dry seasons. Despite these benefits , some people still drain wetlands.\nWater Biomes Information\nThe World’s Biomes – Learn what a biome is and what biomes make up our planet.\nThe Aquatic Biome – A detailed look at the aquatic biomes.\nMarine Biome – Discover the animals and plants that live in the marine biome, along with the health issues they’re facing.\nAquatic Biome – Learn about the aquatic biome and see images of the plants and animals that call it their home.\nLife’s Little Essential – PBS explains why water is vital to the formation and survival of all living things.\nThe Water Cycle – An animated diagram of the water cycle.
