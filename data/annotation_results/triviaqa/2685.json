Standing at the end of Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile, this fine palace is the home of Scottish royal history.\nAt the Palace of Holyroodhouse , visitors can explore 14 magnificent historic and State Apartments, the romantic ruins of the 12th-century Holyrood Abbey and remarkable royal gardens, all with a complimentary audio tour. Best known as the home of Mary, Queen of Scots, the Palace was the setting for many dramatic episodes in her short reign. Today, the State Apartments are used regularly by The Queen for State ceremonies and official entertaining.\nThe Queen's Gallery at the Palace of Holyroodhouse hosts a programme of changing exhibitions from the Royal Collection.\nCurrent exhibition at The Queen's Gallery:\nMasters of the Everyday: Dutch Artists in the Age of Vermeer\nFriday, 4 March 2016 to Sunday, 24 July 2016\nThe Dutch artists of the seventeenth century painted ordinary people doing everyday things. They offer us a glimpse into the rumbustious life of village taverns and peasant cottages, and the quiet domesticity of courtyards and parlours.\nWhile the subject­-matter may be ordinary – the preparation of food, eating and drinking, the enjoyment of music or a family game – the painting is rich and jewel-like, with equal attention paid to a discarded clay pipe as to a fine silk drape. The meticulously documented details often allude to a work's deeper meaning or to moral messages that would have been familiar to the contemporary viewer.\nPresenting 28 masterpieces from the Royal Collection, the exhibition includes works by Gerrit Dou, Gabriel Metsu, Jan Steen and Pieter de Hooch, and Johannes Vermeer's A Lady at the Virginal with a Gentleman.\nPalace Opening times: \nNovember - March 09:30-16:30\n(last admission 15:15) April - October 09:30-18:00 (last admission 16:30)   The Palace of Holyroodhouse is closed on 25-26 December 2016.    Admission prices:    The Palace of Holyroodhouse  (includes an audio tour)\nAdult £12.00 Over 60/Student (with valid ID) £11.00 Under 17 £7.20 Under 5 Free\nFamily (2 adults, 3 under 17s) £31.20\n  Combined Visit: Palace and Gallery\n(includes audio tours)\n\n\nDOCUMENT 9:\n\nPalace of Holyroodhouse: The Queen's Residence in Edinburgh ...
