Grimm (1785-1863) and his brother Wilhelm K. Grimm (1786-1859) pioneered the study of German philosophy, law, mythology and folklore, but they are best known for their collection of fairy tales. These include such popular stories as Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty and The Frog Prince. Commonly referred to now as Grimm's Fairy Tales, their collection was published as Kinder-und-Hausmarchen (Children's and Household Tales, 1812-15). The brothers were born thirteen months apart in the German province of Hesse, and were inseparable from childhood. Throughout their lives they showed a marked lack of sibling rivalry. Most of their works were written together, a practice begun in childhood when they shared a desk and sustained throughout their adult lives. Since their lives and work were so collaborative, it is difficult now to differentiate between them, but of course there were differences.- Jacob, who studied for a time in Paris, was fascinated with variant spellings of older words. He articulated \"Grimm's Law,\" the rules of which are still used today to determine correspondences between the consonants of German and languages in the Indo-European family. Jacob was bolder and more experimental than Wilhelm, and was rumored to be a lively dancer. Throughout his life, Jacob kept rigidly to schedule and could be extremely focused on work that demanded close attention to detail. He never married, but was a loving uncle to Wilhelm's children. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm are buried side by side in Berlin.\nWilhelm K. Grimm (1786-1859) and his brother Jacob W.

Since their lives and work were so collaborative, it is difficult now to differentiate between them, but of course there were differences. Wilhelm, the younger of the two, was said to have been gentle and poetic, and his brother claimed that he was a gifted public speaker. He studied at Marburg, then went to Cassel. In 1825, at the age of 39, he married Dorschen Wild, a playmate from his childhood, who accepted his close ties to his brother without question. Wilhelm enjoyed being married and was a devoted husband and father. Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm are buried side by side in Berlin.\nBibliographic information\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nThis is a book of the Grimm Brothers fairy ... cool fairy tales that were written by the Grimm brothers. ...

I was really interested in these writers, so I decided to learn some more information about them. I went online and learned about their family. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm had seven brothers and sisters, but only six of them lived through infancy. Jacob was born on January 4, 1785 in Hanau, Germany. Wilhelm was born on February 24, 1786. The two brothers had grown up and worked with each other cooperatively. Wilhelm died on December 16, 1859, at the age of 73. Jacob died on September 20, 1863, at the age of 78.\nMarch 26, 2009\nI did more research on the Grimm brothers. Today I learned about many of the stories they wrote. The stories that the brothers Grimm wrote were not from their own fantasy. In fact, they collected quite a bit of their stories from young, literate, middle class women. The brothers published their first book in 1812 entitled \"Kinder-und Hausmärchen\". In English that translates to Children's and Household Tales. It contained 86 fairy tales. Then in 1814 they published a second volume of the book with the same name. This book had 90 stories in it.\nMarch 27, 2009\nI also found out today that they wrote a another book also called Children's and Household Tales, that became published in 1814, but later became known as the Book of Grimm's Fairy Tales. Not many people know that there even is a book called Children's and Household Tales, even though they own a copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales.\nMarch 30, 2009\nI was sick for the past couple of days so I got a lot of time to research on the web. I found out that the brothers had written stories like Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White and Red Rose, The Glass Coffin, and The Crystal Ball. They have written 210 stories all together. These stories were very popular and still are. 200 of the 210 stories are stories but 10 of them are so-called child legends.\nMarch 31, 2009\nToday was my last day of research and I learned that Disney had taken some of the Grimm fairy tales and changed them into different stories and movies. Disney had taken Snow White and Red Rose and turned it into Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. They also took Cinderella and turned it into a short feature and then a full length feature.\nApril 1, 2009\nToday I went online again to see where a good place the Grimm Brothers' books are and it turns out most of their books are in Hanau, Germany, where they grew up. And because today is my birthday, my friends and family saw how interested I am in the Grimm Brothers and their history, they gave me plane tickets to Hanau, Germany so I can find out more cool facts about them! I'm so excited but the sad part is that I won't be able to talk to you (my Journal) for a few days.\nApril 5, 2009\nWell, here I am, in Germany. It's so beautiful here and I already read/bought 5 Grimm books! I went and saw the monument of the Grimm Brothers and got a picture of it. It made me want to read another book. I read Rumpelstiltskin and did some research and found that it was made about a girl one of the grimm brothers met. I am going home now because I think I learned everything that there is to know about them.\nJakob Karl Grimm was born on January 4, 1785, in Hanau, Germany.\nHis brother, Wilhelm Karl Grimm, was born on February 24 of the following year.\nAs small children they spent most of their time together; aside from a brief period of living apart, they were to remain together for the rest of their lives.\nTheir even-tempered personalities made it easy for them to work together on projects.\nNotes:\nhttp://www.bayswaterps.vic.edu.au/lote/maerchen/grimm.ht\nDo you know the story of the Grimm Brothers?\nThey were two brothers called Jakob and Wilhelm who lived in Germany in the first half of the 19th century.\nThey were born in Hanau. They worked together for their entire lives. They were fascinated by poetry and old legends and traveled throughout Germany to collect all the tales that were traditionally told round the hearths of village cottages.\nTheir first book of tales, the \"Kinder und Hausmärchen\", was a great success in Germany and abroad. In Germany it was the most reprinted book after Luther's bible. Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm were also great scholars, researching the origin and development of the German language. They lived and worked in Kassel for many years and they were both made professors at Berlin University.\nhttp://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm.html\n1791. The Grimm family moves to Steinau.\n1796. Philipp Wilhelm Grimm, father of eight Grimm brothers and one Grimm sister, dies January 10, 1796, at the age of 44. Three of his nine children have preceded him in death. His oldest surviving child, Jacob, is 11 years old.\n1798. Jacob and Wilhelm move to Kassel, their mother's home city, to enter secondary school. The 13 and 14 year old boys will live with an aunt.\n1802. Jacob begins his study of law at the University of Marburg.\n1803. Wilhelm begins his study of law at the University of Marburg.\n1806. Jacob and Wilhelm, influenced by the folk poetry collection of Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim, Des Knaben Wunderhorn, begin to collect folktales (Märchen).\n1808. Dorothea Grimm, mother of eight Grimm brothers and one Grimm sister, dies May 27, 1808, at the age of 52. In order to support his younger brothers and sister, Jacob takes a position as a librarian at Kassel. Wilhelm will follow soon.\n1812. The Grimm brothers publish volume one of Kinder- und Hausmärchen (Children' and Household Tales), an unpretentious book containing 86 numbered folktales.\n1814. Volume two of Kinder- und Hausmärchen appears in print, pre-dated 1815, adding 70 stories to the previous collection. This famous work will see six additional editions during the Grimms' lifetime. In its final version it will contain 200 numbered stories plus 10 \"Children's Legends.\" It is destined to become the best known and most influential book ever created in the German language.\n1816, 1818. The Grimms publish two volumes of Deutsche Sagen, a collection totalling 585 German legends.\n1819. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm receive honorary doctorates from the University of Marburg. Their scholarly work on linguistics, folklore, and medieval studies continues, resulting in many publications.\n1825. Wilhelm Grimm marries Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild, who -- together with other members of her family -- had provided the Jacob and Wilhelm with many of their best folktale texts.\n1829-1830. The Grimms resign their positions as librarians in Kassel and accept positions at the University of Göttingen as librarians and professors.\n1837-1841. Professors Grimm join five of their university colleagues in a formal protest against a constitutional violation of Ernst August, King of Hannover. The seven professors (Die Göttinger Sieben) are fired. The Grimm brothers receive many offers for new positions, and finally accept appointments at the University of Berlin.\n1842-1852. The Grimms continue their scholarly work and political activities, but finally give up their formal appointments at the University of Berlin (Jacob in 1848, Wilhelm in 1852) in order to dedicate themselves to their own studies and research.\n1859. Wilhelm Grimm dies December 16, 1859, at the age of 73.\n1863. Jacob Grimm dies September 20, 1863, at the age of 78.\nI added this because It has most of their life.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_Brothers\nBiography\nJakob Ludwig Grimm and Wilhelm Karl Grimm were born on January 4, 1785, and February 24, 1786, respectively, in Hanau near Frankfurt in Hessen . They were among a family of nine children, only six of whom survived infancy. [ 2 [[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_Brothers#cite_note-Michaelis-Jena-9-1 |]]] Their early childhood was spent in the countryside in what has been described as an \"idyllic\" state. The Grimm family lived near the magistrates' house between 1790 and 1796 while the father was employed by the Prince of Hessen.\nWhen the eldest brother Jakob was eleven years old their father, Philip Wilhelm, died and the family moved into a cramped urban residence. [ 2 [[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_Brothers#cite_note-Michaelis-Jena-9-1 |]]] Two years later, the children's grandfather also died, leaving them and their mother to struggle in reduced circumstances. It has been argued[ citation needed ] that this is the reason behind the Brothers tendency to idealize and excuse fathers, leaving a predominance of female villains in the tales—the infamous wicked stepmothers , for example, the evil stepmother and stepsisters in “Cinderella” [ 3 [[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_Brothers#cite_note-2 |]]] However this opinion ignores the fact that the brothers were collectors of folk tales, not their authors:\n\"They urged fidelity to the spoken text, without embellishments, and though it has been shown that they did not always practise what they preached, the idealized ‘orality’ of their style was much closer to reality than the literary retellings previously thought necessary.\" [ 4 [[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_Brothers#cite_note-3 |]]]\"Scholars and psychiatrists have thrown a camouflaging net over the stories with their relentless, albeit hey fascinating, question of 'What does it mean?'\" [ 5 [[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_Brothers#cite_note-4 |]]]\nAnother influence is perhaps shown in the brothers' fondness for stories such as The Twelve Brothers , which show one girl and several brothers (their own family structure) overcoming opposition. [ 6 [[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_Brothers#cite_note-5 |]]]\nThe two brothers were educated at the Friedrichs- Gymnasium in Kassel and later both read law at the University of Marburg . It was the inspiration of Friedrich von Savigny there, who awakened in them an interest in the past. They were in their early twenties when they began the linguistic and philological studies that would culminate in both Grimm's Law and their collected editions of fairy and folk tales. Though their collections of tales became immensely popular, they were essentially a by-product of the linguistic research which was the Brothers' primary goal.\nIn 1808, Jakob was named court librarian to the King of Westphalia , and in 1812 the Grimm brothers published their first volume of fairy tales, Tales of Children and the Home. They had received their stories from peasants and villagers, and controversially from other sources such as already published works from other cultures and languages (eg. Charles Perrault ). In their collaboration, Jakob did more of the research, while Wilhelm, more fragile, put it into literary form and provided the childlike style. They were also interested in folklore and primitive literature. In 1816 Jakob became librarian in Kassel, where Wilhelm was also employed. Between 1816 and 1818 they published two volumes of German legends and also a volume of early literary history.\nIn time the brothers became interested in older languages and their relation to German. Jakob began to specialize in the history and structure of the German language. The relationships between words became known as Grimm's Law. They gathered immense amounts of data. In 1830, they formed a household in Göttingen with Jakob, where both brothers secured positions at the University of Göttingen . [ 7 [[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_Brothers#cite_note-6 |]]] Jakob was named professor and head librarian in 1830, Wilhelm became a professor in 1835.\nIn 1837, the Brothers Grimm joined five of their colleague professors at the University of Göttingen to protest against the abolition of the liberal constitution of the state of Hanover by King Ernest Augustus I , a reactionary son of King George III . This group came to be known in the German states as Die Göttinger Sieben (The Göttingen Seven ). The two, along with the five others, protested against the abrogation. For this, the professors were fired from their university posts and three deported--including Jakob. Jakob settled in Kassel, outside Ernest's realm, and Wilhelm joined him there, both staying with their brother Ludwig. However, the next year, the two were invited to Berlin by the King of Prussia, and both settled there. [ 8 [[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_Brothers#cite_note-7 |]]]\nTheir last years were spent in writing a definitive dictionary of the German language , the first volume being published in 1854; it was carried on by future generations. Jakob remained a bachelor until his death, but Wilhelm married Henriette Dorothea Wild(Also known as Dortchen), a pharmacist's daughter and a childhood friend from whom the brothers heard the story Little Red Riding Hood , in 1825. They had four children, of whom three survived infancy. Even after Wilhelm's marriage, the brothers stayed incredibly close.\nThe Brothers Grimm Biography\nFabulists\nThe German brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm spent years collecting and researching folk tales early in the 19th century. They published Children's and Household Tales in 1812, a collection which became known as \"Grimm's Fairy Tales.\" The collection included what are now some of the world's most famous stories, including Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel and Rumpelstiltskin. Wilhelm married in 1825, but Jacob never wed and for most of his life lived in his brother's home. The brothers also began a German historical dictionary, the enormous Deutsches Worterbook, which ran to 16 volumes when it was finally completed by others in 1954.\nExtra credit: The Brothers Grimm, a fictional thriller based (very) loosely on the brothers, was released in 2005. The film starred Matt Damon as Wilhelm and Heath Ledger as Jacob... The Grimm fairy tale Snow-White and Rose-Red was made into the animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarves by Walt Disney . Disney also adapted Cinderella as an animated short in 1922 and a full feature in 1950.\nThese are all of the stories that they wrote\nThis is a picture of the Grimm Brothers\nThe Brothers Grimm. Courtesy of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://grimm.thefreelibrary.com/\nThe Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse.\nThroughout their lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology, and although Wilhelm's work was hampered by poor health the brothers collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until a century after their deaths.\nBut they were best (and universally) known for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral sources and published in two volumes of Nursery and Household Tales in 1812 and 1814.\nAlthough their intention was to preserve such material as part of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon came into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about fifty stories \"with the amusement of some young friends principally in view.\" They have been an essential ingredient of children's reading ever since.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nThe History of The Brothers Grimm. ...

If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales, so said Albert Einstein. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were The Brothers Grimm, story tellers and publishers of European folk and fairy tales which were anything but sweet and gentle bedtime stories.\nGerman linguistics professors, specializing in what became known as Grimm’s Law, the way sounds in words from related languages have developed over time such as German ‘Apfel’ and the English ‘Apple’, the brothers brought together age-old fairy tales which they published in collected editions. The tales portrayed life as it was known by generations of central Europeans, unpredictable and often cruel, and some of these were told to them by peasants, but many came from the middle and aristocratic classes who had heard them from their servants. Especially their nursery maids.\nJakob Ludwig Karl Grimm was born on January 4, 1785, in Hanau near Frankfurt in Germany, his brother Wilhelm Karl Grimm on February 24 1786, and they were the oldest surviving children of nine born to Philipp Wilhelm Grimm, a lawyer who served as Hanau’s town clerk, and his wife Dorothea Grimm.\nPhilipp Grimm died when Jakob was eleven. Close as children, as the brothers grew up they continued to spend most of their time together and, apart from a short time apart, remained together their entire lives, even after Wilhelm’s marriage, while as they both had placid temperaments it was easy for them to work as a team.\nTheir characters were also complementary because Wilhelm, with his warmer personality and a greater interest in music and literature, worked on the presentation of their fairytale collection, while Jakob, a pedantic workaholic, was in his element being responsible for most of the necessary research as well as developing their language and grammar theories.\nLinguistic research was their main goal, however while studying they had been encouraged by one of their University of Marburg professors, Friedrich von Savigny, to take an interest in past cultures, and the collections of tales through which they became identified were a development from what they considered to be their ‘real’ work.\nOnce the brothers saw the tales had found an audience with young readers, even though this had not been the readership they had envisaged, they, but mainly Wilhelm, began to ‘fix’ things, and although the spirit of the stories remained Grimm fairy tales themselves changed, slowly becoming less graphic and cruel and instead more charming, humorous and moral.\nJacob Grimm was appointed court librarian to the King of Westphalia in Bad Wilhelmshoehe, Hesse, in 1808, and it was not until 1816 that he joined his brother in Kassel where William had been working at the library since 1814. The brothers stayed there until they moved, as a ‘double pack’, to the University of Goettingen, Lower Saxony, in 1830, and from there, seven years later, they were sacked and deported, because they had protested against a breach of the constitution by the new King of Hanover.\nDuring their time of separation Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm had continued their interest in folktales, editing pieces of folklore and early literature, and produced a work that, alongside Luther’s Bible, is the most widely circulated of all German books and has been translated into 160 languages.\nThe first of what was to be many editions of Brothers Grimm tales was published in 1812, and ‘Kinder-und Hausmaerchen’, Tales of Children and the Home, is filled with stories passed down orally for generations and gathered from many different regions. Included in that world of fantasy are Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Snow White, Rumpelstilzchen, The Brave Little Tailor, The Wolf and the Seven Little Goats, and Rapunzel.\nIn its preface was written ‘Perhaps it was just the right time to record these tales, as those who should have been preserving them are becoming rarer,’ and ‘All of these tales contain the essence of German myth, which was deemed forever lost.’\nAt the same time the Grimm brothers knew that their folktales existed in similar versions in other European countries, so were not wholly German, and in later editions of their book they added that the tales could be ‘at home everywhere’.  Nevertheless the German fairytale tradition has been created.\n‘The Tales of Children and the Home’ was followed between 1816 and 1818 by two volumes of German Legends, ‘Deutsche Sagen’, as well as a study into the history of early literature, Old German Forests, ‘Altdeutsche Waelder’.\nGerman Romanticism was popular during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. As an arts movement which valued humor, wit and beauty and favored a return to nature and a focus on national culture, especially folk tales, this had awakened an interest in the past throughout the Germanic nations, so the Grimm brothers found a ready audience for their books and were amongst the most important, and influential, of the early language and folklore romantic historians.\nThey both loved their people and were determined through their work with linguistics and folktales to preserve their heritage, and they were also dedicated supporters of a united Germany. At the time there was no ‘Germany’, the Holy Roman Empire, of which much of what is now Germany had been the heart, had only recently been dissolved and the area consisted of 39 small to medium sized states, independently ruled by an assortment of Royal Families, where the only thing they all had in common was their language.\nResearching forgotten roots, the brothers Grimm had originally immersed themselves in the study of Old German which had then developed in the direction of all things Germanic, anything that might help to forge a common German consciousness, hoping their writings would help towards creating a sense of German identity.\nTheir work on sagas, myths, ancient laws, the origin of words and grammar laid the foundation of German Studies, and another major undertaking,the Deutsche Woerterbuch. A complete dictionary of the German language, which they began in 1838, and was not completed until 1960, was in fact their most important project and their intention was to trace the origin of every word. ‘The force of language forms nations and holds them together, without such a bond they would fall apart’, was Jakob’s reasoning.\nBoth brothers had become professors at the University of Berlin, and died there while working on their dictionary: Wilhelm on December 16,1859, after completing the letter D; and Jacob four years later, on September 20, 1863, having completed A, B, C and E, and, it is said, he was working on ‘Frucht’ (fruit) when he collapsed at his desk.\nThey travelled widely, had a thorough grasp of other languages and literature, championed causes in and relating to other countries, belonged to foreign academies and concerned themselves with many things outside their own surroundings and experiences, and today Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm, The Brothers Grimm, collectors of fairytales and protectors of Germanic culture, heritage and language, could easily be described as amongst the first ‘Europeans’.\n \nPhotos: The Brothers Grimm, 1855, by Elisabeth Jerichau Baumann 1819-1881, National Gallery in Berlin – ‘Ashputtel/Cinderella’ from Grimm’s Household Tales, Date 1912, New York Public Library, edited by Robert Anning Bell – Title page of first volume ‘Deutsches Woerterbuch’, by Brothers Grimm, 1854, scanned by Raimond Spekking – All courtesy de.Wikipedia.\nRelated Topics\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\n1812.

The doodle celebrates the 200th anniversary of \"Grimm's Fairy Tales,\" a compendium of European folk tales first published in 1812 by German brothers Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm and Wilhelm Carl Grimm.\nYou've probably heard of the Brothers Grimm before, but the lives of the two brothers were every bit as interesting (and, in some places, as dark) as the folk tales they canonized.\nToday we know Jacob and Wilhelm mainly for the collection of fairy tales bearing their name, but the brothers were also accomplished linguists and historians. Jacob, the older brother, was born in 1785 in Hanau, Germany , to wealthy parents; Wilhelm was born about thirteen months later. The brothers' father, a lawyer, died suddenly when they were still children, and the family suddenly went from enjoying a large house with servants to relying on financial support from extended family.\nRecommended: The 20 most fascinating accidental inventions\nBecause they had no father, Jacob and Wilhelm grew close to each other. They attended the University of Marburg, where their law professor introduced them to philology -- the study of language in historical texts. Because of their family's poverty, Jacob and Wilhelm were excluded from the school's social life -- which drove them to pursue their studies more energetically.\nPhotos of the Day Photos of the weekend\nAfter college, both brothers worked as librarians in the town of Kassel. Neither Grimm earned much at his job, but their jobs gave them enough time to continue studying, and in 1806 they began writing down the folk tales they heard around Kassel. At first, the brothers were more interested in the stories' research value than their entertainment value -- Jacob was especially concerned with how German had evolved from languages of the past, and even went on to develop \"Grimm's Law,\" which describes how consonants changed over time to give rise to modern German.\nThe Grimms published the first volume of their collected folk tales -- called \"Children's and Household Tales\" -- in 1812, and a second volume in 1814. Though they continued to write scholarly books and articles on linguistics and medieval studies, their folk tales gained them the most recognition, and they even received honorary doctorates from their alma mater.\nBy the way, if you've ever read \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\" and felt they were a little dark for kids, you have German culture during the early 1800s to thank. After the book was published it attracted criticism for its sexual content, so the brothers edited these themes out of subsequent editions. But because the violence of the stories wasn't frowned upon in the same way, it was retained and in some cases even increased.\nIn 1825 Wilhelm married Henriette Wild, whose family had supplied the Grimm brothers with some of the best stories for their folk tale collection. Jacob never married, but apparently lived happily with the new couple -- one scholar noted that the brothers \"both live[d] in the same house, and in such harmony and community that one might almost imagine the children were common property.\" The brothers moved to Gottingen in 1830, where they established the field of Germanic studies at the University of Gottingen and continued to publish books on mythology and linguistics, while simultaneously editing their collection of folk tales.\nThe brothers' academic careers were upset in 1837, though, by some political upheaval. When King Ernest Augustus I demanded oaths of allegiance from university professors and other civil servants, Jacob and Wilhelm refused. They were fired from their posts, along with five other professors, and three of the group -- including Jacob -- were deported. He moved back to Kassel and was joined by Wilhelm, but the brothers once again found themselves impoverished, and had to rely on the financial support of friends.\nIn 1840 their fortunes changed when both Jacob and Wilhelm received job offers from the University of Berlin. There, they continued their research; further polished their folk tale collection, now in its third edition; and also worked on a comprehensive German language dictionary. Jacob retired from the university in 1848 to focus on his studies, and Wilhelm followed in 1852.\nThe two brothers continued working together for the rest of their lives. When Wilhelm died in 1859, the Grimms' collection of folk tales had reached its 7th edition and had grown to 200 tales-- including \"Hansel and Gretel,\" \"Rapunzel,\" and \"Snow White\" -- plus 10 \"Children's Legends.\" Jacob, deeply saddened by his brother's death, became more withdrawn until his death in 1863.\nThe Grimm's collection of folklore had already been popular during their lifetimes, but it went on to become one of the most celebrated works of German literature and the basis for countless books and movies during the next two centuries. On the list of the best-selling authors of all time, some figures place the Grimms in third place -- preceded only by Shakespeare and the Bible.\nFor more on how technology intersects daily life, follow us on  Twitter @venturenaut .\nNext up\nGet the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\nDaily\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nDownload this stock image: In 1812, the Grimm brothers, Jacob and Wilhelm, ... published Children and Household Tales, a collection German fairy tales.

This illustration accompanied the tale about \"Rapunzel\" and shows the whisked witch cutting Rapunzel's hair after she learns that a prince has been visiting Rapunzel in the tower where the witch confined her. This image is from Grimms Eventyr (Grimm's Fairy Tales) by Carl Ewald, published in 1922. The frontispiece has the illustrations by Philip Grot Johann and R. Leinweber.

The Complete Brothers Grimm’s Fairy Tales (Illustrated Edition) by Jacob Grimm, Wilhelm Grimm & The Brothers Grimm on iBooks\n*Contains both volumes of the Fairy Tales, including 200 fairy tales and 10 children’s legends\n*Illustrated\n*Includes Table of Contents\nThe Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859) were German brothers who remained close friends, and both studied law. While Jacob went on to study philology, Wilhelm wrote. The two of them worked on creating a German dictionary, but it would not be finished until long after they were both dead.\nThe Brothers would be lost to history, except they also collaborated on a collection of 200 fairy tales and published two volumes of them in 1812 and 1814. Although their intention was purely to preserve the material and try to keep the German culture and history alive, their collection proved to be massively popular with young children. The first English translation arrived in 1823, making them a must read for children ever since. \nThis edition of Grimm’s Fairy Tales is specially formatted with a Table of Contents and is illustrated with more than 15 pictures from this legendary collection. \nCustomers Also Bought\n\n"
