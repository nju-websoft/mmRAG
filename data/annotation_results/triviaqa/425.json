This is my second purchase of this disc (the first met an unfortunate end). While some of the songs don't really appeal to me most I like.\nBy A well shod girl on June 9, 2013\nFormat: Audio CD|Verified Purchase\nAmazing, inspiring, enchanting, great sound. This is my third purchase of this cd, yes cd, I'm old school. I absolutely love the selection and variations of the modern and spiritual pieces offered. Children will also love this, and it is a great introduction to the most notable voice of this earth. Will also stimulate conversation to educate children and adults of strife endured by countries and people's at war and how the most simple of life's daily activities become a blessing to accomplish .\nBy Bookarelife on July 28, 2016\nFormat: Audio CD|Verified Purchase\nWonderful Concert. Michael Bolton will shock you.\nBy Leslie Swartz on November 21, 2014\nFormat: Audio CD|Verified Purchase\nA speedy delivery and awesome CD. I had a tape of this performance, so have been missing hearing\nall the wonderful selections.  Thanks!\nBy Thomas on January 10, 2012\nFormat: Audio CD|Verified Purchase\nyou want some good music and love a change of pace this album is worth it. pavarotti sings lioke an angel bringing out some true music. i feel it was worth it to have in my collection. its a hard find and now that pavarotti is gone its going to get harder to find his music.\nBy Donna Driscoll on May 5, 2015\nFormat: Audio CD|Verified Purchase\nIt's good\nBy Holly Delohery/Rosebud Carroll on February 7, 2014\nFormat: Audio CD|Verified Purchase\nI wish I had known the songs which were on CD.  I would have had  a better idea as to what I was selecting on this CD.\nBy Gilly Bean on January 3, 2001\nFormat: Audio CD\nA wonderful concert for a wonderful cause. The previous reviewer only gave it 4 stars because he said there were too many different styles of music. Well, that's the whole point. It is the music community, regardless of genre, getting together to raise funds to build a Music Centre in Bosnia-Hercegovina, which will provide music therapy, tuition and a space where music will be used to enable young people to learn, to grow and to be healed. Music is for everyone, and all these different artists getting together for the common good, regardless of genre, is wonderful. And on this album are a number of suprises. Dolores O'Riordan of The Cranberries singing with Pavorotti on \"Ave Maria\", Meat Loaf and Pavarotti duetting on \"Come back to Sorrento\", to name just two. A must have for music fans in general.\nBono and Brian Eno and Luciano Pavarotti and Michael Kamen and Orchestra Filarmonica Di Torino and The Edge\n$0.99\nBono and Brian Eno and Dolores O'Riordan and Jovanotti and Luciano Pavarotti and Marco Armiliato and Meat Loaf and Michael\n$1.29\n\n"
