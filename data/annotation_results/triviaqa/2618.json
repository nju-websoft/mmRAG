        "\nDOCUMENT 1:\n\nIn 2002 a BBC poll for its presentation of the “100 Greatest Britons” had him in 64th place. ... 90 to “A nationalist hero ... Guy Fawkes, have a look on ... Wings Over Scotland | A nationalist hero Wings Over Scotland | A nationalist hero\nWings Over Scotland\nPosted on           April 07, 2013          by Dave McEwan Hill\nOn the 12th May 1916, a man born 48 years previously in Edinburgh’s Cowgate was strapped to a chair in Kilmainham Jail, Dublin and – after receiving the last rites – was shot by a firing squad. He was too weak to stand.\nIn 2002 a BBC poll for its presentation of the “100 Greatest Britons” had him in 64th place. Yet he is hardly known in Scotland. Virtually the only time his name impinges on public consciousness is when those who wish to honour his name by public march in Edinburgh have to be given police protection from violent Unionist bigots .\nAt the age of 14 James Connolly (with his brother John) had enrolled in the British Army under the name of Reid. A seven-year posting to Ireland undoubtedly had a significant effect. On return to Edinburgh he became heavily involved in workers’ causes and the Scottish Socialist Federation, becoming its secretary in place of John, who’d been sacked by Edinburgh Corporation for agitating for an eight-hour day.\nHe abhorred the sectarian division fostered among Scotland’s working classes by unscrupulous employers to weaken worker solidarity. Connolly became an early member of Keir Hardie’s Independent Labour Party, and an acquaintance and inspiration to John McLean. (Connolly’s part in the Dublin Easter Rising and the subsequent independence of Ireland was a significant influence in McLean’s later formation of the independence-supporting Scottish Workers Republican Party.)\nThere was great communication and cooperation between Scottish and Irish socialist organisations in the 1890s, and when a position as secretary of the Dublin Socialist Club – paying a pound a week – came up, Connolly (now struggling in Edinburgh with three children) applied for and got the position. There he very quickly became a right hand man to Jim Larkin, the Liverpool-born founder of the Irish Labour party.\nBut it was in 1916 that Connolly stepped into history. On the 24th of April 1916 the two men at the head of a rebel Irish army declaring Irish independence were the son of an Englishman and an ex-British soldier born in Edinburgh. The commander-in-chief as the rebels seized the GPO in Dublin was Padraig Pearse and his second-in-command was James Connolly, leading the “Irish Citizens Army” – drawn from the Irish Trade Unions and Irish Labour Party.\nThe citizens of Dublin were puzzled, somewhat amused and largely dismissive of the rebels who had seized a number of buildings in central Dublin. A Proclamation of the Republic was read out and the rebels settled in for a siege.  They held out under intense bombardment till the 30th of April. On surrender many of them, including a badly wounded Connolly, were bundled off to jail to await their individual desserts. Those who had signed the Proclamation had little doubt what fate awaited them.\nIn the interim, Ireland had not risen as the rebels had hoped. Metropolitan Dubliners had shown little enthusiasm for insurrection, though Irish Home Rule and Dominion status was by a large distance the most popular political position of the day. The rubble in the city centre was cleared. Life went on. But just when the cause of independence seemed to have faltered, London stupidity intervened to revive it.\nBecause in May, the executions started.\nThe prevailing view in Ireland until then had probably been that these rebels, many of whom had marched in from impoverished rural Ireland, were “daft laddies”. The first batch of executions however sent a shockwave across the country. They might have been daft laddies but other daft laddies from Ireland were at that very moment in Europe fighting with Britain’s army for the freedom of small European nations. The comparison was drawn. The tide turned.\nToo late, the politicians in London understood their blunder. They suggested the executions be stopped. The military were having none of it. Appeals – like that from poet WB Yeats – that the execution of prisoners of war was a crime were ignored. The executions continued, to mounting anger across Ireland. The execution of James Connolly was the last.\nAs shooting a badly-wounded man (Connolly was expected to die within a day anyway) on the floor and tied to a stretcher was probably too much even for the officers that ordered the slaying, he was strapped into a chair and sat upright for his dispatch. He died forgiving those about to shoot him.\nIt could be reasonably argued that if any single act (in a long and terrible history of British barbarism in the country) propelled Ireland to independence it was the cold-blooded killing of Edinburgh’s James Connolly. In September, when thousands of Scottish nationalists marched from the Meadows to Prices Street Gardens, the James Connolly Society marched with them. It was probably the first time it had marched in Edinburgh without having to face attempted harassment.\nThe significance of this is easily missed. There is, in central Scotland particularly, a community who know and revere James Connolly. It is a large community and a critical one when one thinks of referendums. It is a nationalist community that doesn’t vote nationalist.\nThe previous inability of the Society to have been able to publicly honour James Connolly in his native Scotland without fear of attack has for decades provided certain elements of Unionism with the opportunity to keep much of this community suspicious of Scottish independence. They exploit that opportunity on a regular basis.\nIf an independent Scotland is to be worth having at all, men like James Connolly deserve an honoured place in its affection, free from the intimidation of bigots. On a day when a Scottish “quality” newspaper is attempting to disgracefully smear Scottish nationalists by associating them with fascists and the Nazis, now seems as good a time as any to start righting that wrong.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nAs those of you here in the UK will have been unable to avoid, the BBC has been running a poll for the hundred Greatest Britons. The top ten were (in order): Winston ... \"Greatest Britons\": WI they never existed - groups.google.com \"Greatest Britons\": WI they never existed - Google Groups\n\"Greatest Britons\": WI they never existed\nShowing 1-256 of 256 messages\nRichard Gadsden\n11/24/02 5:00 PM\nAs those of you here in the UK will have been unable to avoid, the BBC has\nbeen running a poll for the hundred Greatest Britons.  The top ten were\n(in order):\nThe obvious WI to take from this lot is: \"WI they had never been born?\"\nI'll kick off the easy ones - the political/military figures.  The\nartists, scientists and the engineer are much harder to look at a world\nwithout them.\nRemove Churchill from history and you have profound effects long before\nhis great achievements during WWII.  I don't think that the Sudan\ncampaign, the Boer War, or the Liberal Government of 1906-1914 would have\nbeen profoundly different in his absence, but Gallipoli would never have\nhappened.  The resources that went to Gallipoli would not all have ended\nup on the Western Front - the ANZAC troops surely go to Egypt instead.  \nPerhaps one result would be a much quicker victory for Allenby in the\nLevant.  Does that affect the post-war settlement?\nAfter that, there's the Black-and-Tans in Ireland, the British Gazette\nduring the General Strike, the return to the Gold Standard and then the\nlong wilderness years.  The Black-and-Tans were surely inevitable; but\ncould the General Strike have /succeeded/ without Churchill to oppose it?  \nAnd What is the effect of that on industrial relations - an eventual\nrevolution?  If Britain hadn't re-entered the Gold Standard, would there\nhave been a successful Labour Government through the crises of 1931?\nAnd then we get to WWII, but I'm exhausted.\nElizabeth I\nIf she's not born, then there's no successor to Mary Tudor in 1558.  The\nlegitimate Queen is Mary II Stuart, Queen of France, England and Scots\n(or is James V still alive?).  But Mary I's widower (Philip II of Spain)\nisn't going to be keen on a French Queen (consort) becoming Queen\n(regnant) of England.  Even after Francis' death, there's a hell of a war\nthere.  My one real prediction is that England ends up Catholic, and a\ndependent of either France or Spain, at least to start with.\nNelson\nDid the RN have enough good admirals to defeat France and/or Spain without\nhim?  I think they did, though the details are inevitably going to be\ndifferent.\nDoes the Parliamentary side still win the Civil War without him?  I think\nthey do, but in a bloodier and so more bitter fashion.  Perhaps that means\nCharles is executed first time around.\nWithout Cromwell, there is surely a military coup much earlier.  Monck?\nI'm really struggling with this one; Ireland might well have been\nindependent and Catholic; Scotland independent and Presbyterian.  Perhaps\nthere would be no Kingdom for Charles II to come back to - or perhaps he's\njust King of Scots and Great Britain falls apart (much like the\nSpanish-Portuguese union of the same era).  And English Republic that\nlasted, opposed to a Scots-Irish Kingdom would be an interesting result.  \nAnd James VII would be no more popular in Scotland than he was in England.\nA Scots Republic in 1686 and James as King of Ireland?\nFor those interested in picking up one of the other hundred and running\nwith them:\nThe definition of a 'Great Briton' for the purposes of the nominations\nwas: anyone who was born in the British Isles, including Ireland; or\nanyone who lived in the British Isles, including Ireland, and who has\nplayed a significant part in the life of the British Isles.\n11 Ernest Shackleton\n14 King Alfred the Great\n15 Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington\n16 Margaret Thatcher (Baroness Thatcher)\n17 Michael Crawford\n31 Leonard Cheshire (Baron Cheshire of Woodall)\n32 Eric Morecambe OBE\n53 TE Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia)\n54 Captain Robert Falcon Scott\n55 Enoch Powell\n57 Sir Alexander Graham Bell\n58 Freddie Mercury\n61 Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother\n62 George Harrison\n66 Sir Charles (Charlie) Chaplin\n67 Tony Blair\n74 King Robert the Bruce\n75 Bob Geldof KBE\n78 Edward Jenner - BBCi History\n79 David Lloyd George (1st Earl Lloyd George of Dwyfor)\n80 Charles Babbage\n87 John Lydon (Johnny Rotten)\n88 Field Marshal Montgomery\n95 Sir Barnes Neville Wallis\n96 Richard Burton\n\"I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death\nyour right to say it\" - Attributed to Voltaire\nAs if Diana Spencer ever did anything other than inflate tabloid sales and\nfigurehead charities.

Di almost single-handedly kept the retail economy of Great Britain\nafloat with her shopping sprees.\nJohn Lennon, on the other hand ,definitively deserves inclusion in the Top\nTen, just after Elizabeth the First.  He was, after all, the second best\nsinger/songwriter in the Beatles and their third best guitar player. And he\nalso had a few totally fucked up LPs with his wife in the late 60s (anyone\nlistened to \"Two Virgins\" lately?) a truly awful live album from Toronto in\n1969, two good albums followed by four really bad albums (Sometime in New\nYork City, anybody?) and then did nothing for five years before coming back\nwith a nice record of adult contemporary songs whose essential message was\n\"everything is fine...chill out\" before getting shot by a nutcase. Along the\nway he managed to weaken the credibility of the antiwar movement with his\nutterly ill-informed, idiotic, and self-serving antics like the bed-in for\npeace and conducting interviews from a bag.  So I think that easily puts him\nahead of the likes of Nelson and Cromwell.  I mean, when did they ever write\na hit song?\nIn article < memo.2002112...@tg001a0001.blueyonder.co.uk >,\n  ric...@gadsden.name (Richard Gadsden) wrote:\n> As those of you here in the UK will have been unable to avoid, the BBC has\n> been running a poll for the hundred Greatest Britons.  The top ten were\n> (in order):\nI don't recognize several of these names, to wit:\n>\n(actually, this does look vaguely familiar - 14th century?)\n> 26 William Tyndale\n> 31 Leonard Cheshire (Baron Cheshire of Woodall)\n> 32 Eric Morecambe OBE\n> 78 Edward Jenner - BBCi History\n> 85 Sir Richard Branson\n> 95 Sir Barnes Neville Wallis\n> 100 Marie Stopes\nOn Mon, 25 Nov 2002 01:00 +0000 (GMT Standard Time),\nric...@gadsden.name (Richard Gadsden) wrote:\n>As those of you here in the UK will have been unable to avoid, the BBC has\n>been running a poll for the hundred Greatest Britons.  \n[snip]\nLike rating Britney Spears over Jimi Hendrix in a listing of top\nAmerican rock artists.\n\"Robert A.

In particular, the whole\nGryffindor/Slytherin good/evil thing, which gets rather badly\nflattened out in the films, is rather a nice metaphysical puzzle.\nThe weakness of the books, for me, is characterisation: about the only\nremotely complex characters I can think of are Snape and Sirius Black,\nand even they're described mainly in terms of how baffling their\nbehaviour is to the kids.

Gordon and Kipling on it, at another time\nWellington and Cook, and even Ruskin before his fall from grace.  A 19th\nCentury public might also have chosen Gibbon; the educated public, that\nis, which was in the minority then.  The list restricts public memory to\n10 (as if this were the David Letterman show); equal in rank and\nattainment (for good or ill) names like Milton, Dickens, Shaw and Wilde\ncome in there at least in intellectual terms but also as influences on\nBritish life.  Darwin in his day would hardly have been chosen, even in\nthe later 19th Century, I think; his position was anti-establishment and\ncontroversial  But this is a poll, not an informed evaluation.  And\nBritain has been great enough that such a list should have fifty names\non it, easily.\nWho the hell is Isembard Kingdom Brunel?\nAs far as Diana goes, popular memory and affection are what counts in\ndefining \"greatest\", not achievement, intellectual or artistic standing,\nor \"other\".  Certainly this is what's part of the myth surrounding\nGloriana and so her position in the list, although certainly she had a\nchance for real rule that Princess Di never did or could - so as to have\nnotches on her kirtle, something worth being on the list before.  \"If\nDiana had lived\" and her anti-landmine campaign had really taken on\nsteam, and she had entered the world stage as an independent stateswoman\nfor children's rights, AIDS etc, and really attained her goals, then\nshe'd belong in the same category as others on the list.  But the public\nloved her, and believed in her potential even if it may not really have\nbeen there.  She reminds me of Margaret Trudeau in some ways; thrust\ninto a life she was not suited for, marrying \"politically\" even though\nlove was involved, enduring the public eye and freaking out in front of\nit, too.\nhttp://www.cayoosh.net (Bridge River Lillooet history)\nhttp://www.hiyu.net (Chinook Jargon phrasebook/history)\n>>No one knows, the Scuddamore (sp) family - who are descended from him\n>>via the said daughter are supposed to know where the grave is....\n>\n> One 'd', I thought, though I've heard the name far more than I've seen\n> it written down.

Brought to you (with some exageration\nBy Tzintzuntzan) by the sort of accademic who decides that his\nrather dry tome would be more popular if he reworked his thesis\ninto some outrageous statement based on a rabidly overprecise\ndefinition.  The folks who claim (frex) that there was no concept\nof childhood before the 19th century (when what they really mean\nwas that the concept of childhood was somewhat different back then,\nbig surprise) or that nationalism didn't exist before the French\nrevolution (when they mean that \"Frenchness\" was not the primary\nidentity of French peasants before the revolution).\nWere Irish, Jews, etc. considered White in the 19th century?  Well,\nif you asked someone point blank \"are they White\", they would almost\ncertainly say yes, but some might add, \"but they're not _proper_ White\nMen.\"  To elaborate:\nThere is more than one concept of \"whiteness\" current in society at\nthe time.  One definition, the scientific one, defined \"Whites\" as\nthe \"Caucasian race\", which included Europeans, Middle Easterners\nand even Asian Indians. But this didn't mean all Caucasians were\nequal.  Any nationality could be spoken of as a \"race\" on its own,\nand many were deemed to be \"degenerate\" or \"mongrel\" races.\nFurthermore, anthropologists soon \"discovered\" a tripartite division\nof Europeans into the \"Nordic\", \"Alpine\", and \"Mediterranian\" races,\noften presented as a hierarchy with Nordics at the top.  Finally,\nEugenics adds a new wrinkle to this, by suggesting that a man's\nracial fitness could be an individual matter, not just one common\nto his nationality.\nSimilar, but not quite the same, as the scientific definition,\nwas the legal definition in the US.  Here Europeans were all\nWhite, but Middle Easterners and South Asians were in an ambiguous\ncatagory (ultimately, Sikhs were deemed not White, while Syrians\nwere deemed White).  It also differs in that the \"one drop of\nblood\" rule was often applied to rule that people who looked\nwhite were actually black, but this was restricted to matters of\ndemonstrable individual geneology, usually within America, not\nto condemn other ethnic groups (ruling, say, that Sicilians had\nAfrican blood, and thus failed the one drop test).\nFinally we get the social definition, or rather definitions.\nThere was no social consensus of Whiteness.  Rather perceptions\nof Whiteness were highly situational, depending on ones own\ncharacter, as well as ones class, ethnicity, and position.\nYes, you did have Anglo-Saxons depreciating the Whiteness of\nthe Irish, of Jews, of Southern and Eastern European groups,\neven sometimes of Germans and Scandinavians.  Yet they were\nalso aware of the legal and scientific definitions, and could\nreally only say that these groups were not completely or\nsufficiently White, not that they were not White at all.\nAnd the Irish themselves, had no doubt about their Whiteness,\nwhile the Germans could form their own racial theories in\nwhich it was the English who were less white...\nSo, in summery, it is true that Anglo-Saxons looked down on\nother White groups, regarded them as racially inferior, and\nsometimes questioned their whiteness.  But when push came\nto shove, other White groups were still treated as Whites,\njust not posh Whites.\n\"Old Toby\" < plai...@mindspring.com > wrote in message\nnews:3DE8C9DF.50DED221@mindspring.com...\n> > You have to tick a box in the US Census?

What we're debating (for\npurposes of WIs about the census) is whether Irish, or Mediterranians,\nwould be forced to check something different on a census in an ATL.\nIIRC, census-takers in 19th century America would record that\nthere were \"Italians\" here, \"Irish\" there, and so on, not lumping\nthem all together as white -- but when WASPS were recorded, I\ndon't think \"white\" was the shorthand for them. Although, also\nIIRC, sometimes censuses in the American South would record the\nrace of certain people as white or non-white (in which case\nIrish etc. might be good enough for them).\n(snip)\n> Were Irish, Jews, etc. considered White in the 19th century?  Well,\n> if you asked someone point blank \"are they White\", they would almost\n> certainly say yes, but some might add, \"but they're not _proper_ White\n> Men.\"  To elaborate:\n> There is more than one concept of \"whiteness\" current in society at\n> the time.  One definition, the scientific one, defined \"Whites\" as\n> the \"Caucasian race\", which included Europeans, Middle Easterners\n> and even Asian Indians.

Celts\nweren't any of the above -- a legacy going back to when Englishmen\nregarded Irish as barely civilized savages (and Catholic to boot).\nIt had softened a lot by the 19th century, of course, but Irish\nimmigrants in the USA were never really accepted -- the two of\nus are disagreeing on whether all those \"no Irish need apply\"\nsigns meant they were considered not really white, or not proper\nwhites, or whether this is all splitting hairs.\nNew York's famous ethnic gangs -- often with WASPS and Irish on\nopposite sides -- do say a lot about the two groups being\nseperate, and Tammany Hall's cultivation of Irish immigrants\nagainst entrenched WASP elites. Some of the complaints made\nabout the Irish are barely distinguishable from modern American\ncomplaints about other immigrants.\n> Yes, you did have Anglo-Saxons depreciating the Whiteness of\n> the Irish, of Jews, of Southern and Eastern European groups,\n> even sometimes of Germans and Scandinavians.  Yet they were\n> also aware of the legal and scientific definitions, and could\n> really only say that these groups were not completely or\n> sufficiently White, not that they were not White at all.\n> And the Irish themselves, had no doubt about their Whiteness,\n> while the Germans could form their own racial theories in\n> which it was the English who were less white...\n>\nThat's something that I've never been able to figure out --\nAnglo-Saxon attitudes toward German racist philosophers.\nIn the ACW, German troops were often taunted for their poor\nEnglish, and a stereotype developed about them being thick-\nheaded and slow. Some ethnic German party machines developed\nto match the Irish ones like Tammany Hall, or the WASP ones\nlike in Phillidelphia.\nBut there was a lot of other talk about how Anglo-Saxons were\nsuperior because they were a \"Teutonic People,\" and how\ndemocracy and hard work were German ideas dating back to the\nbattle of Teutoberg Forest (never mind how democratic Germany\nitself was, or whether \"German efficiency\" was more than a\nmyth). And there was some talk in Britain about how there\nshould be an Anglo-German alliance against the Slavs and\nLatins.\nAnd then there was the revival, in WWI, of seeing the Germans\nas not so close to the English-speaking world anymore --\n\"kill the Hun\" and all that. But since the German philosophers\nthemselves often didn't know what to think of the English-\nspeaking world, maybe it's only logical that the Anglo-Saxons\ndidn't know what to think of them.\n(And I've used -- how many different terms for the same thing?\n\"Anglo-Saxon?\" \"WASP?\" Guess all this proves is how dumb\nmost of these classifications are, although that's one of the\nthings all posters seem to agree on.)\n> So, in summery, it is true that Anglo-Saxons looked down on\n> other White groups, regarded them as racially inferior, and\n> sometimes questioned their whiteness.  But when push came\n> to shove, other White groups were still treated as Whites,\n> just not posh Whites.\n> In article < 20021128225954.00486.00000178@mb-fl.aol.com > on 29 Nov 2002\n> 03:59:54 GMT, cassiu...@aol.com (Emperor) wrote:\n>\n>>Naturally, I'm gonna go with my description.

My\nex-girlfriend had a Polish-German mother whose family had been in Texas for\ngenerations and, on the Polish side, in America since before the American\nRevolution. Her father was mostly Filipino, but his paternal grandfather\nwas Basque and so, quirkily, he had a Basque surname despite looking pretty\nmuch entirely Filipino. His family had been in California since just after\nWorld War II - his father had, IIRC, been a U.S. Navy cook in the\nPhilippines, and migrated to San Fransisco afterwards.\nWhen she came here to Australia, I happen to know that one of my friends\ndidn't realise for three months that she was anything other than\ngenerically \"American\" because her Californian accent was so strong. He\ncertainly didn't realise she was just about half-Asian (hell, do you even\nconsider Filipinos Asian?). At home in California she was \"claimed\" by the\nAsian *and* Latino groups at her high school.\nSuffice it to say that it's a tricky business. I actually only\nintellectually came to the realisation that I am technically one-quarter\nIrish myself - my paternal grandmother's family emigrated to Australia\naround the same time as did the family of the bushranger Ned Kelly, and\nsettled in the same region of Victoria. Does being one-quarter Irish mean\nanything, though? My mother's father was surnamed French, and was blond -\nwas his family Anglo-Saxon or out-and-out Norman?

There is a\nperception, however inaccurate, that the Lebanese aren't white largely\nbecause they consider themselves distinct from the rest of the population -\nit seems the perception that \"Australian\" means British-Celtic-Nordic\nobtains in \"ethnic\" populations as well.

(save\nthrough a bunch of antique British children's activity books someone had\nhad around when I was growing up).  By the time I got back to the Two\nTowers after starting with the Fellowship, I'd read past the first\nchapter, where I'd abandoned trying to understand the story from that\npoint, without realizing it was the same passage until I'd thought about\nit; the language as I'd first at it seemed obtuse and distant, like an\nold document; but after starting in the Shire and spending time with\nelves, rangers and wizards for a while the mind is led into a space\nwhere the language of English as it is spoken in Tolkien's Middle-Earth\nsounds completely natural, representing the Common Tongue (to Numenorean\nas French is to Classical Latin) and the language of Gondor.  I thought\nit was quite an achievement, and continually found passages in the book\non later readings that I thought were stylishly written and notable for\ntheir spare language and sense of drama.  Tolkien's not a GREAT writer,\nbut he's a GREAT storyteller; and he's also exquisitely articulate in\nthat way that only British academics can be; especially one schooled in\nthe old oral tradition and poetics and linguistic theory since ancient\ntimes etc.  He has a natural command of the language, i.e. the language\nas he's chosen to style it in Middle-Earth.  Sort of a grand Arthurian\nEnglish that never existed, augmented by auxiliary invented languages\nlike Quenya, Sindarin etc.  To actually write not only a consistent\ntrilogy in this but also undertake the Silmarillion at the same time,\nwith even more eloquence, to me is a great work of writing, certainly\nTolkien's greatest, collectively, compared to his academic essays and\nthe plays, poems and lesser tales.  He may not have cranked out literary\nopus after literary opus in the manner of some great novelists (in any\ngenre), but he was a teacher and a scholar after all and only wrote this\nstuff in his spare time - which makes it all the more remarkable.  Peake\nand Eddison worked at their tomes, and tomes they are; stiff and\nunreadable I found them; they'd probably sound more natural if I'd gone\nto a British school in that period but they both seem over-wrought and\nover-courtly; Eddison in particular is heavy on the descriptive detail\nof places and buildlings, physical objects or people's countenances, and\nit slows down the story.  The only Peake I managed to make full sense of\nwas an excerpt from Gormenghast called \"The Lamb\", where Titus meets a\ndemon lamb who's made only of wool; scary shit and I was grown up by\nthen; like reading Lovecraft.  Eddison's story, on the other hand, is a\nrollicking one if it moved the tempo up a bit.  Tolkien never lets this\ndown, except maybe for the morbid stuff across Eriador and as Frodo and\nSam struggle with their demons in sight of Barad-Dur where it's more\ncharacter struggle than adventure story (come to think of it, Denethor\ngoing nuts should be a treat in the third movie; who'd they cast in that\nrole again?)\nI've tried reading The Glittering Plain by Morris and other stuff by\nsame, and found it all too pre-Raphaelite-y thick in language; Lindsay's\nmy favourite; by the end of Arcturus I swear I knew what jale looked like.\n>\nAnd the man himself (there's also a short counterfactual, \"Eighty\nYears in the Kingdom of Finland\", regretfully in Finnish only):\nThe title \"King of Finland\" wasn't used by the Kings of Sweden or the\nEmperors of Russia. Historically, the Finnish provinces under the\nKingdom of Sweden were at first a Duchy, granted by King Gustav Vasa\nto his son in 1556, and existing for a brief time as a\nsemi-independent feudal quasi-state. After the accession of Duke Johan\nto the Swedish throne as King John III in 1581, he adopted the title\n\"The Grand-Duke of Finland\" for ceremonial purposes. For the following\ncenturies, the so-called Grand-Duchy of Finland, \"Magnus Ducatus\nFinlandiæ\", existed mostly on paper, and the \"Grand-Duke of Finland\"\ncontinued to be a fancy title which the Swedish Kings occasionally\nused themselves or granted to their sons, more or less similar to the\n\"Prince of Wales\" in Britain. The last \"Grand-Duke of Finland\" of this\nkind was crown prince Gustav, the son of Gustav IV Adolf. Emperor\nAlexander adopted the historic title, and also gave it some real\nsubstance. The \"Grand-Duchy\" had acquired some central administration\nof its own already by the end of the Swedish rule, such as the \"Royal\nFinnish Commission for the Maintenance of the Waterways\" founded in\n1799, which was the predecessor of today's TVH (Road Administration),\nbut in general, most of the national institutions and bureaucracy\nweren't founded until after 1809.\n(For the same long historic background of the title, Finland is a\nGrand-Duchy also in \"Stella Polaris\". Founded in 1743, with Karl Peter\nUlrich of Holstein-Gottorp as the first Grand-Duke.)\nCheers,\n>---It's weird.  If you're Asian-Pacific Islander, you check\n>one of a whole slew of boxes.  If you're \"Hispanic,\" you\n>check off a race box (white, black, or other), _also_\n>check off the Hispanic box, and then write in whatever\n>flavor of Hispanic you happen to consider yourself.\nI left the category blank in 1990, since \"Second Generation\nNon-Micronesian Hispanic Pacific Islander of Asian Descent.

You know I'm a longtime fan of Gustav, but still, he did stay out\nof the thirty years war when he really could have made a difference to the\nProtestant cause, was very aggressive in Poland, and ensured the war would\ncontinue as a foreign invader. But I admit I'm clutching at straws here -\nyou're right when you note the 1631 was campaign was undertaken with great\ndiscipline by contemporary standards. But the behaviour of the Swedish\narmy following Nordlingen was generally as appalling as any other (though\nGustav can't get the blame directly, being dead). Bavaria was deliberatly\npillaged though, (\"burnt from end to end\"), the sort of thing which simply\nwasn't done by parliamentary forces (or royalist for that matter) in the\nenglish civil war.\nBut I'll accept a fair cop, you've got me bang to rights. It was a poor\nexample. Gustav was a better soldier in terms of treatment of his enemies.\nBut I still claim Cromwell's attitude to military morality was certainly\nno different to that of the majority of the generals operating in Germany.\n> Besides, belle se ipsum alet, collateral damage, et cetera - and IMO,\n> Cromwell did not have the same excuses for his conduct in Ireland.\nI think he did, or at least trampling and pillaging everything in sight\nwas standard operational practice in Germany, and I can't see why its OK\nthere but not in Ireland.\n \n> Personal opinion, but I think you picked a bad analogy all the way.\nI think you're right. And I'm not trying to suggest it was \"OK\" what\nCromwell did. But I don't think it was something that set him apart,\neither as a wicked man or a great one, and I don't think it was his Irish\ncampaign which stopped him being considered \"Great\". He would still be\ncalled \"a blood soaked regicide\" (you say it like it's a bad thing) even\nif Drogheda was as clean as Breitenfeld (i.e. still nasty, but easier to\ndefend).\n> a better one, you could equate Cromwell's actions in Ireland to, say,\n> Carl X Gustaf's \"Deluge\" against Poland, or even more accurately, to the\n> terror which the Swedish crown directed against the native Greek\n> Orthodox population of Karelia and Ingria during the \"Rupture\" of the\n> 1650s, and then I might agree that you do have a point - although\n> Cromwell would still be at the far end of the curve, I think.\nOn the curve, but not at the far end IMHO - but I'm willing to concede the\npoint, as it's not the thrust of my argument. My point is that Cromwell's\nIrish behaviour is incidental to his enduring legacy as a \"Great Briton\",\ncompared to his manifest failure to find a way to preserve the\ncommonwealth beyond his own lifetime.

This was, along with the Societas Rosicruciana in\nAnglia, a major source of the first wave of members in the GD.\nMoreover, since it admitted women (which the SRIA, composed solely of\nMaster Masons, obviously did not) this is where you would find a lot\nof the women who were in the GD from the first.\nYou also referred to Crowley being influential in the Golden Dawn and\nwhether modifying that would be part of a POD. Thing is, he was only\nin it for a few years, and was not that influential. Joined in 1898 or\nso, supported Mathers in the schism on 1900, was not in much contact\nwith the GD at all for a number o f years after that, until he had a\nfalling out with Mathers. By then the GD was already splintered.\nOne of the triggers of the split between the Isis-Urania Lodge in\nLondon and Mathers, to be sure, was that the London adepts refused to\ninitiate Crowley a 5=6 when he was due for the grade, and refused to\nrecognize his initiation when AC went to Paris and received it from\nMathers.

These were very different things, US\nattitudes were shaped primerally by America's position as a\nmajor center for immigration and by ethnic competition within\nAmerican society.  Britain didn't have to deal with large numbers\nof German immigrants, and had a society based more on class than\nethnicity.  So American views of \"the Germans\" were often filled\nwith typical responses to rivalry and quick stereotypes based on\nthoughtless observation, while Brits were more likely to base\ntheir views on book learning and racial theory.\n2) You are confusing reason and rationale.  Racism was fundamentally\na rationale for pre-existing stereotypes. Occasionally, when dealing\nwith an unfamiliar group, \"racial science\" might provide an actual\nreason for stereotyping a group, but mostly it just provided a\nconvenient, but not necessary, explanation for what people already\nthought.  So they could look at Blacks and say \"Negroes are stupid\nbecause they are a lower race.\"  But that didn't leave them unable\nto say \"Germans are slow because, um, er, well, they're just slow.\"\n> (And I've used -- how many different terms for the same thing?\n> \"Anglo-Saxon?\" \"WASP?\" Guess all this proves is how dumb\n> most of these classifications are, although that's one of the\n> things all posters seem to agree on.)\nI wouldn't say \"Anglo-Saxon\" and \"WASP\" are synonymous.

So, I'm here to agree with you. Irish\nmeant culturally and linguistically Irish like Jackie Mulheron said a\nlittle while ago. It wasn't necessary to be Catholic or to live in\nIreland to be Irish although it would obviously help settle the issue\nif there was any doubt. The MacIains of Glencoe, they of massacre\nfame, lived in Scotland and were most likely Presbyterian but they\nwere just every bit as Irish in any way that mattered as the genuinely\nIrish Irish fighting for King James in Ireland at the same time. I\nbelieve that Stair had it put about after the fact that the MacIains\nwere Catholic, but most likely he was aiming to hedge his bets.\nWhile it's a bit odd that the cultural and linguistic inheritors of\nthe Scots should be called Irish while the rest of the inhabitants - a\nmixture of Picts, Britons, Anglo-Saxons, Norse, Flemish, French and\nwho knows what else, speaking a West Germanic language closely related\nto English - should be called Scots, that's how it was. (But in both\nScots and Irish Gaelic the non-Gaelic speaking Scots are Saxons and\nthat's not any more logical.) Certainly it was like that a good\nhundred years before Charles I got his head chopped off. Dunbar's _The\nDance of the Sevin Deidly Synnis_ of circa 1500 calls highlanders\n\"Erschemen\" and their language \"Ersche\". Barbour's _Bruce_ written\nbefore 1400 describes Angus Og of Islay's men as \"off the Ilis\" (Book\n11, about line 340). So that's not very helpful then but there are\nanother 19 books and they are all on the web if someone fancies\nchecking them.\nI don't suppose an Irish language was ever spoken by a majority of\nthose living inside the borders of modern Scotland at any time in the\npast. In the east north of the Forth the inhabitants spoke Pictish.\n(Sometimes I've wondered if they still do speak it at home in deepest,\ndarkest Fife). South of there they originally spoke a P-Celtic\ndialect, like Welsh or Breton, gradually replaced on the west and\nsouthwest edges by Irish and elsewhere by English or Scots. The\narrival of the Vikings reduced the Pictish area in the north but it\nalso displaced Irish in many of the Islands. Going by placenames north\nof Mull would likely have been speaking a Norse dialect at the\nmillenium. Even south of there Isla, Jura and plenty other islands\nhave Norse names even if there are plenty Gaelic names as well and\nSomerled, legendary (or maybe not) founder of Clan Donald had a Norse\nname. ISTM that there must have been a great revival of Gaelic\nsometime after the millennium which probably reached it's apogee about\nthe same time as the Lordship of the Isles did (ca 1400).\nSo it looks as if any ideas of Celtic links between Scotland and\nIreland would be stuff and nonsense. Bits of Scotland perhaps, but\nreally the bits without roads, towns or anything else much apart from\npeat and midgies. Hence the connection with Ireland I suppose,\nalthough Ireland did have the odd town courtesy of invaders. Nobody\napart from the Vikings and the Irish appears to have wanted to invade\nthe Western Isles. Well, the Vikings settled Greenland and Iceland\nwhich suggests they weren't too picky at all. The Irish didn't have\nmany other choices of places to invade. Although if it had been me and\nthere had been any choice in the matter, I'd just as soon have stayed\nin Ulster.

In the fall of 1749,eager to create a school to educate future generations, BenjaminFranklin circulated a pamphlet titled \"Proposals for the Education ofYouth in Pennsylvania,\" his vision for what he called a \"PublicAcademy of Philadelphia.\"[14]HP506782-001 Laptop Keyboard\nHowever, according toFranklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first had the idea toestablish an academy, \"thinking the Rev. Richard Peters a fitperson to superintend such an institution.\" Unlike the other Colonialcolleges that existed in 1743—Harvard, William and Mary,and Yale—Franklin's new school would not focus merely on education for theclergy. DELLPK1303Q0100 Laptop Keyboard\nHe advocated an innovativeconcept of higher education, one which would teach both the ornamentalknowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a livingand doing public service. The proposed program of study could have become thenation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was neverimplemented because provost William Smith preferred a traditionalcurriculum.[15]SONYVAIO VGN-FS742/W Laptop Keyboard\nFranklin assembled a boardof trustees from among the leading citizens of Philadelphia, the first suchnon-sectarian board in America. At the first meeting of the 24 members of theBoard of Trustees (November 13, 1749) the issue of where to locate the schoolwas a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from IndependenceHall was offered without cost by James Logan,TOSHIBASatellite L775D-S7332 Laptop Keyboard\nits owner, the Trusteesrealized that the building erected in 1740, which was still vacant, would be aneven better site. On February 1, 1750 the new board took over the building andtrusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751 the Academy of Philadelphia, usingthe great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, took in its first secondary students. FUJITSUCP270342-02 Laptop Keyboard\nA charity school also wasopened in accordance with the intentions of the original \"NewBuilding\" donors, although it lasted only a few years. In 1755,the College of Philadelphia was chartered, paving the way for the additionof undergraduate instruction. All three schools shared the same Board ofTrustees and were considered to be part of the same institution.[16]TOSHIBA9J.N7482.901 Laptop Keyboard\nThe institution of higherlearning was known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779,not trusting then-provost the Rev. WilliamSmith's loyalist tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislaturecreated a University of the State of Pennsylvania.[16] Theresult was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version ofthe College of Philadelphia. In 1791 the legislature issued a new charter,merging the two institutions into the University of Pennsylvania with twelvemen from each institution on the new board of trustees.[17]SONYVAIO VGN-AR500 Laptop Keyboard\nPenn has three claims tobeing the first university in the United States, according to universityarchives director Mark Frazier Lloyd: the 1765 founding of the first medicalschool in America made Penn the first institution to offer both\"undergraduate\" and professional education; the 1779 charter made itthe first American institution of higher learning to take the name of\"University\"; and existing colleges were established as seminaries.[18]HPPavilion dv6-2115sa Laptop Keyboard\nAfter being located indowntown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved acrossthe Schuylkill River to property purchased from the BlockleyAlmshouse in West Philadelphia in 1872, where it has sinceremained in an area now known as University City. Although Penn beganoperating as an academy or secondary school in 1751 and obtained its collegiatecharter in 1755, HPpavilion DV7-1005eo Laptop Keyboard\nit initially designated 1750as its founding date; this is the year which appears on the first iteration ofthe university seal. Sometime later in its early history, Penn began toconsider 1749 as its founding date; this year was referenced for over acentury, including at the centennial celebration in 1849.

The topic our favorite book, and why reading was important. There’s nothing I love more than reading, so I was thrilled. My seventh grade novel of choice was Charlie Bone, the tale of a musically gifted boy who learns he can hear photographs talk.   I still remember my opening line: “Books are magic, transporting us to a different land.” It impressed, and I won our school’s competition, moving on to the district-wide round. I practiced for hours; there was no way I could lose.   A podium stood facing a crowd of parents, with a ring of chairs behind it for the competitors. Three judges sat at a table with stoic faces poised to take notes. I took my seat amongst the eight other contestants dressed in the middle school version of business attire.   Two students gave their unimpressive speeches, and then I was up. I stood in front of the crowd and choked. I rushed through my sentences and stumbled over words, while my hands pinwheeled at my sides, making gestures completely unrelated to what I was saying. In short, it was a complete disaster—and needless to say, I lost.   While my public speaking skills haven’t improved over the years, my love of books has only grown, so I’m giddy to bring you \"Off the Books,\" our exploration of all things novel-related in honor of National Novel Writing Month (page 52).

Music blasts as students mill around, trying on wetsuits, adjusting harnesses, and cracking jokes. It’s a typical night in the Syracuse University Outing Club’s (SUOC) equipment room, or E-Room, located through a nondescript door at the backside of South Campus’ red barn. Immediately to the left of the door, a projector streams YouTube videos of rock climbers and skydivers. To the right, a rope hanging from the ceiling suspends a student mid-air as he learns the basics of vertical\ncaving, in preparation for an upcoming caving trip. SUOC typically hosts between 10 and 15 trips a week, offering outings like hiking, mountain biking, and whitewater kayaking. Lilly Brown, a senior economics major, recalls crawling through a mud pit during one of her first caving trips. The challenge of it, she says, made her fall in love with the sport—and the club—even more. From the line of license plates on the ceiling to the row of kayak paddles covering the back wall, every inch of the room serves as evidence of past adventures.

A recent CNN poll showed 59 percent of Americans oppose Congress authorizing military action in Syria, in addition to 72 percent believing said action would not achieve any goals, leaving President Obama caught in a bind. Still reeling from the Iraq War, Americans are defiant in their call to stay out of international conflicts. Professor Miriam Elman, who specializes in international security and Middle Eastern relations, argues the cure for Americans’ fear of involvement is support from other countries. “The American public has become largely isolationist when it comes to military solutions and interventions, at least in the Middle East and North Africa. The public does not see America's vital interests at stake in these conflicts,” Elman says. She clarifies that to avoid allowing a failed state to become an anti-American haven, multinational interventions are necessary.\nPHOTO CREDIT: http://bit.ly/17mE97a\nSyria almost blew up in our faces a minute ago, and the fact that most people can’t point to the Middle Eastern nation on a map is only the tip of the iceberg. It’s to the east of Iraq—you know, under Turkey? North of Jordan? Nevermind). To understand the United States’ situation with Syria, here’s an index cardsized explanation: Two years ago, peaceful protests began to challenge the government currently in power. President Bashar al-Assad responded with a violent crackdown. Syria is now engulfed in a full-fledged civil war, most recently pushed into our media spotlight because of the chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21 in Damascus, a suburb outside Syria’s capital. Resulting in over 1,200 fatalities, this use of chemical weapons crossed the “red line” President Obama drew in the sand of biological warfare. In response, the United Nations passed a resolution requiring Syria to abandon its weapons stockpile.\nThe U.S. was almost on the brink of a brand new military conflict, and it’s becoming important to know what our generation— the Millennials, and the future leaders of tomorrow—thinks about intervening in other nations. But unless directly asked by an international relations professor, it seems we don’t think about it much at all. Sure, everyone will quietly and with a raised question markimplying voice say that the United States shouldn’t get involved in any more conflicts; but when asked the dreaded question: “Why?” we respond in silence. Growing up in the wake of conflict in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, and all the American newsroom and family dinnertime commentary that went along with it, our generation is conditioned to reject all ideas of military intervention. The irony lies in the fact that so few of us know the full situation. We only know that the answer is to look up from our Instagram feeds and give a loud and confident, “No!”\nIf not military action, then peaceful intervention stands as the only answer. Elman points out that not all aid is synonymous with boots on the ground, and that, in its hesitation, the United States has lost its chance in Syria. “The U.S. should have provided material assistance to the rebel movement early in the conflict,” Elman says. “Now, two years later, any intervention will not lead to an outcome that would be as beneficial as transitioning Syria to a democracy it once could have been. A democratic Syria is no longer an option on the table.” The U.S.’s best hope now, Elman says, is stability: an end to the ongoing violence. With peaceful intervention out, and military intervention considered a stressor on a fragile situation, the American public can finally feel pacified by its isolation. It seems that in terms of international issues, America resembles a swaddled baby: useless and asleep. JM\nJERK\nBy Natasha Schuyler\nCOLOR BLIND In college admissions, positive discrimination means race first, test scores second.\nIn 2008, Abigail Fisher sued the University of Texas Austin for rejecting her application. Their reasoning: They wanted to accept lessqualified minority students—not another white female. Five years later, this past June, the Supreme Court voted 7-1 to uphold affirmative action in college admissions, given that schools couldn’t achieve diversity otherwise. Consequently, Fisher’s case bounced back home, its fate left for reexamination in a lower Texas court. Fisher v. University of Texas questioned the race-conscious admissions process. Being half-black, I’ve always had an investment in affirmative action’s effects. So in the process of applying to graduate schools, I spoke to Judge Jawwaad Rasheed, Support Magistrate of the Oneida County family court system and a former admissions counselor. He explained my ethnicity gave me leverage over white applicants in the admissions process. My LSAT scores could be considerably lower than those listed on a school’s website and I still might be accepted—maybe even with a scholarship. The problem is, I don’t think of myself as black. I’m biracial and grew up in a completely white neighborhood. I used to believe affirmative action created a barrier in the United States—as long as it existed, the country couldn’t look past skin color. And given the ridiculous standardized test scores many schools require, it’s easy to see how many people of color might think they would not be able to get into college without affirmative action.\nBut it’s in this way that the stigma associated with affirmative action is created. “People think it’s taking a black person off the street with an eighth grade education, putting them in a college setting, and expecting them to do the work—that is not the case,” Rasheed says. Just because affirmative action may give students of color may an advantage over a white student, doesn’t mean they aren’t qualified to receive a solid college education. Especially when most schools’ required SAT or LSAT averages are kept unrealistically high to justify accepting a low percentage of applicants. And that’s not because the work is so difficult that only 10 percent of the applicants can do it. As universities skew the numbers to make themselves look far more elite than they actually are, they create the stigma that affirmative action is a cop out for anyone it applies to. Is affirmative action unfair? Perhaps. But it’s not because institutions are lowering expectations for minorities, but because they don’t offer the opportunity of higher education to those who meet the realistic admission scores.

JM\nBITCH\nBITCH\nWith a history of patchy successes, it's not worth squashing Olympic dreams for an LGBT boycott that won't yield results.\nBy Meg Zukin : Illustration by Christina Mastrull There must be something in the vodka because Russian officials are causing a frenzy over their stance on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights. Some countries— including the United States—are talking about boycotting the 2014 Sochi Olympics. As of June 30, Russian law prohibits individuals from engaging in “propaganda” as a means of protecting children, according to PolicyMic. This refers to distributing information that creates or glamorizes nontraditional sexual attitudes, equates the societal value of traditional and nontraditional sexual relations, or generates\n20 11.13\n•\nJERK\nhoopla in nontraditional sexual relations. In case you haven’t caught on, “nontraditional sex” is synonymous with LGBT sex in the minds of our antiquated Russian friends. Punishment for natives includes fines or jail time. Foreign citizens or stateless individuals risk possible deportation––hopefully to San Francisco, where the exiled tourists could gaily frolic in peace. I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area where the homophobes are considered pariahs and the LGBT community is revered. My town is a California cliché within itself. Its inhabitants include avocado-eating,\nweed-smoking, gay-loving liberals, and last year my flamboyantly gay best friend won the title of Homecoming King by popular vote. The fight for LGBT rights isn’t simply a “social issue du jour” for me, but a personal battle. That being said, I don’t think that boycotting the Olympics will solve anything—and it certainly won’t bring home any medals. Supporters of pulling out have history on their side—after all, this wouldn’t be the first time the U.S. opted out of the Olympics. In 1980, when the U.S. protested the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan, they banned Americans from competing in the summer games. Instead of crying tears of joy on the podium, banned athletes cried tears of disappointment from their couches where they sat watching the summer games. That year, the U.S. Water Polo team lost the chance to dominate in their Speedos in Soviet Russia. “I was devastated that I couldn’t go. I put a lot of time and effort into the sport and we had a very good chance of winning the gold,” says Steve Hamann, starting goalie for the 1980 U.S. Olympic Water Polo Team. “People say they’re going to boycott, but I think that’s the wrong direction. We should be trying to spread goodwill and sportsmanship.” So if we don’t boycott the games, what the hell are we supposed to do? The United States is the world’s policeman—we tell other countries when they are breaking laws while we sit on our high horses drinking Dunkin’ and eating donuts. Roger Hallas, Associate Professor of English and Director of LGBT Studies points out that Westerners need to pay attention to the specific needs of Russian LGBT rights. “There’s a longtime history of English and American activists going to other countries with LGBT issues and potentially doing much more harm than good,” Hallas says.\nBesides, if the United States really wanted to show Russia who ruled the roost, the boycott would have to be on a much grander scale than protesting against some silly games, anyway. According to Hallas, cultural boycotts have had a “patchy history,” and aren’t considered efficient, especially when dealing with those stalemate Russians. And buying Belvedere instead of Smirnoff isn’t going to cut it. The United States would have to commit to a much larger protest—such as refusing to buy Russian oil or gas—to send any serious message to the Russians. Boycotting the Summer Olympics in 1980 resulted in nothing but bitter athletes and a returned boycott by the Soviets in 1984. Doing the same in 2014 will do nothing but repeat history. The best bet for Olympic athletes is to venture out to Sochi, win their respective medals, and celebrate with a massive, gay orgy in Olympic Village. Maybe we can even extend an invite to Putin. JM\nJERK\nS S A EP\nFRE\nBy Ian Simon-Curry In fashion, sex sells––clothes, that is. But when sex sells success, the industry looks the other way. Recent reports reveal a history of turning a blind eye when sex abuse becomes a professional currency. Earlier this year, 17-year-old Meghan Chereek ran away from home after a fight with her father. Seeking fame and fortune, she moved to Los Angeles where she met Jimmy Sommers, CEO of the clothing brand Wildfox Couture, in a restaurant. He seduced her with promises of modeling and design work, wrenching her into the Hollywood lifestyle of booze, drugs, and sex. She’s since filed a lawsuit, accusing Sommers of creating a hostile living environment after, unable to pay her rent, she had to move in with him.The suit claims that Sommers continued to demand sex from her and never provided her with the promised work. This isn’t news. “What\n22 11.13\nJERK\nPHOTO CREDIThttp://hypebeast.com/2013/2/rihanna-by-terry-richardson-for-rolling-stone\nCertain fashion industry bigwigs have a collection of sexual assault charges, yet their reputation remains unblemished in the industry.\nshe is alleging goes on in the fashion and entertainment industry all the time,” says Jeff Herman, Chereek’s lawyer. Reports of similar behavior run rampant. Famed fashion photographer Terry Richardson has had a reputation for inappropriate sexual behavior for years. His provocative style of photography almost always features models and celebrities in the nude. In fact, a casting page on his website makes a standing request for models over the age of 18 who want to pose nude. He's never been sued or convicted of sexual abuse, but a sufficiently large and continuous batch of complaints against Richardson suggest that his lasciviousness is quite real. Many models report that he requested they call him “Uncle Terry” and that he tends to be as nude as his subjects when shooting. A February article from The Fashion Spot reports that model Charlotte Free defended Richardson in a since-deleted statement on her Tumblr blog, angrily calling out models who accuse him of abuse. The post reveals a troubling attitude towards misconduct that permeates the industry.The notion that others are “waiting in line” to take the place of models unwilling to accept sexually inappropriate situations suggests that abuse is just part of the job. In such a sexualized industry, there seems to be a dangerously fine line dividing acceptable behavior and abuse. Many models fear speaking out about sexual harassment because it can mean losing professional connections and experience. And it’s not just models who are wary of speaking out either. A March 2010 Jezebel article collected stories about Richardson from industry insiders, all of\nwhom spoke on the condition of anonymity, given the photographer’s powerful position in the fashion world. One such anonymous source described how a friend of hers—a stylist who formerly worked with Richardson—saw him abusing young, naked Eastern European models, taking advantage of the fact that they spoke little English. The stylist was so ashamed and afraid to speak up that she quit working for him. Though Richardson’s behavior is widely known, he continues to find work with influential magazines and brands. The industry willfully ignores sex abuse by those in its top tier. Advocacy groups, such as the Model Alliance are taking strides to change things, aiming to improve working conditions for models and make it easier for them to report sexual harassment. Its Model Alliance Support system partners with the Actors’ Equity and the American Guild of Musical Artists to provide a way to discreetly report grievances via email. This effort by the Model Alliance is admirable, and certainly is needed, but even more of an impact could be made if someone in a position of power at a magazine or brand would take a stand. Nothing would communicate a rejection of the fashion world’s current apathy towards sex abuse better than a well-known editor refusing to work with Richardson or anyone with a history of inappropriate behavior. But this industry that treats its most famed names like gods, it’s going to take some serious movement to knock them off their pervy pedestals. JM\nJERK\n11.13 23\nSMUT\nPrestige Doesn't Pay PayScale’s college rankings on return on investment following graduation forces students to think twice about the value of an education.\nWith retailers everywhere cashing in on the autumnal season, we forget what this time of year is actually about. By Amanda Maldonado\n24 11.13\n•\nJERK\nclimbs illustrate the relative uselessness of traditional university evaluations. Syracuse University Professor of Political Science Kristi Andersen suggests that these academic rankings are not useful for those applying to college. Generic ratings perversely motivate colleges to improve the areas academic ratings look at—not the overall school. This may expand funding and applicant pools, but the institution’s value becomes severely overinflated. Brad Gorham, S.U. associate professor and the chair of the Communications Department, simply says, “All of these ratings are partly B.S. anyway.” While colleges are certainly capitalizing massive tuitions, the end result after graduation is never as large as you imagine. The substantial number of engineering and technical schools on PayScale’s list is almost shocking. They argue that an engineering degree, and other specialized programs, will pay off more in the job market than a liberal arts degree—no matter what institution stamps the paper. Whichever way you slice it, the statistics look frightening. But what you make of your education can never be ranked—and if the numbers get you down, remember, “Education and intelligence aren’t the same thing.” JM\nPHOTO CREDITS: http://dailym.ai/GDiDDU Copyright of Starbucks\nBy Brendan Germain : Illustration by Dylan Cowlie Everybody needs a degree. But the value of that flimsy diploma does not always equate post-grad. PayScale, a financial and salary informational site, has released a new list of top institutions that base rankings on the economic merit of one’s degree, rather than academics. So watch out philosophy majors, your education just became more obsolete. Created in 1984, the “granddaddy of college rankings,” U.S. News and World Report, began churning out lists curated by journalists who rarely even visit the schools they evaluate. The news magazine instead collects data from online sources, opinions from faculty and staff, and information from the institution’s website. PayScale, launched in 2002 by former Microsoft manager Joe Giordano, evaluates post-graduate earnings, economic status, and the return on investment (ROI) you— or your parents—get back for your college education, switching the focus from a university’s prestige to a degree’s financial value in the real world. PayScale ranks U.S. News’ top institutions lower than you might expect. Yale University, constantly battling for the top spot, comes in at 93 on PayScale’s 2013 list, with a 5.8 percent annual ROI. Syracuse University, usually ranking 62, pulls a paltry 360 on PayScale with just 5 percent annual ROI. The staggering drops and significant\nof It\nSo\nLast spring, I lugged my Southern California life 3,000 miles east when I transferred to Syracuse University—without visiting once. Parka-clad students asked, “Why the hell would you move here?” with as much warmth as a January morning. And after a semester of weather-centric whining, I returned this fall prepared to earmuff the East Coast negativity. Instead, I’ve encountered a new version of the SU clone—the state fair-loving, Pumpkin Spice Latte-sipping, cashmere sweaterwearing wannabe. The same people so baffled by my decision to leave Los Angeles now rep this corner of the country with more pep than the models in a Vineyard Vines catalog. This transformation defies logic and yet somehow, I’m the crazy one for moving to Central New York, where half-assed excitement for these few autumnal pseudo-traditions mark me as the ignorant one.  Yes—pseudo-traditions. I don’t think overdosing on pumpkin-spice-and-cashmereeverything for a few months justifies tradition. I’m not against the idea of a community united by celebration; I just don’t understand what we’re celebrating. Maybe it’s a childhood of\nOctober heat waves or a lack of red-yellowand orange memories from growing up on the East Coast, but raised in the super-season of Beachy and Balmy, I can’t relate to the fantasy fall of New England postcards. There isn’t a specific day Californians trade in boogie boards for rakes. And we’re not obligated to chug gallons of apple cider or wrap ourselves in knit scarves, either. Yet every year, these items roll out at the start of September, marking the onset of fall on the East Coast while the same hallmarks in the West have no emotional resonance.  Regardless of where you’re from, fall should be about the familiarity of spending time with friends and family while going to that stupid fair—or raking leaves, or making pumpkin bread—year after year. Put the value in seasonal traditions, not the byproducts themselves. It’s easy to get swept up in the hype of something new, but keep your “I HEART FALL” shirts out of sight. And come Snowmageddon 2013, shut up and let this warm-blooded Golden State native hold onto the warmth of home.

Her schedule, her life sounds like a nonstop responsibilities included setting tables, marathon.

When large orders\n26 11.13\n•\nJERK\narrived in the evenings after the customers left, Troyer’s boss would send home all the workers, except the employees earning $2.13—they had to stay and unload boxes of frozen food and crates of produce for a few extra hours. “So we’re getting paid $2.13 an hour to be doing a job of someone that gets paid 15 dollars an hour,” Troyer says bitterly. Discussions of raising the minimum wage have flitted in and out of the Congressional arena on both state and federal levels. Minimum wage is supposed to set the standard so that individuals earning the lowest income can survive on a 40-hour workweek. Yet people, like Troyer, have to work extra hours to make ends meet. New York has the fourth highest cost of living in the country, yet unlike California, Washington, and Vermont— whose minimum wages all have increased to eight dollars or more to compensate for their\ncosts of living—N.Y.’s minimum wage remains unchanged at $7.25. Don Dutkowsky, an economics professor at SU’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, says these states have increased wages because they want their residents who work full-time minimum wage jobs to be able to support themselves without living in poverty or needing government assistance. NewYork has yet to follow suit, and Dutkowsky doesn’t see it happening in the immediate future. “I think it’s the government’s task to ensure that if people can work 40 hours a week that they’ll be out of poverty,” Dutkowsky says. “But at a current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, even if somebody does the right things, they can’t support a life beyond poverty with that wage.”   Increased wages would allow students, who constitute a large majority of the people holding minimum wage jobs, to work fewer JERK\n•\nSMUT\nSMUT\nhours and dedicate more time to their studies. Which means students, like Troyer, wouldn’t have such draining itineraries. With higher pay, students would also get a headstart on paying off student loans while in college.   Phyllis Weber, another SU student, feels the tension as she attempts to balance school and her minimum-wage job. Weber, a junior duel international relations and anthropology major, laments about her job at a restaurant on Marshall Street. The job makes her life a balancing act—depleting her social life and threatening her academics, but not paying enough. “I thought about quitting and I talked to my parents about it, but it’s just not plausible. It’s hard figuring out hours and keeping up with school,” Weber says, laughing weakly. “This semester it’s been very difficult. I’m very behind right now.”   Last fall, Weber had to pick up a second job at the Carrier Dome. It’s unusual for her not to work a full shift at the Dome until 10 p.m., hurry home to study for a few hours,\nsqueeze in a quick shower if she has time, and then trek to her job on Marshall to work until 4 a.m. This semester, however, she chiseled her workload down to one job—but it still takes a toll on her life. “I would love to work less,” Weber says. “It would provide me more freedom to be a normal kid in college.”   Juxtaposing the cost of living with minimum wage, Dutkowsky believes minimum wage would have to be increased to at least 12 dollars an hour to adequately help people survive and stay out of poverty. If it was an appropriate amount, students who work diligently, like Troyer and Weber, wouldn’t have to battle to make ends meet. Weber knows of coworkers who work full-time, earning minimum wage, but are still forced to live off welfare or some other state aid.   Insufficiently paying jobs everywhere leave workers feeling exhausted and exploited. Last month, community organizers, employees of Walmart, and the United Food and Commercial Workers planned protests in\nmajor cities across the country for better wages and hours for Walmart employees.This conglomerate of people, referred to as Organization United for Respect (OUR) at Walmart, staged these demonstrations across 15 cities—including New York City,Washington D.C., Seattle, San Francisco, and Chicago – on Sept. 5, 2013.

Protesters called for full-time\n“EMPLOYERS STRETCH [MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS] THIN BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN DO ANYTHING AND WE’LL TAKE THE MONEY FOR IT BECAUSE WE NEED THE JOB,” —SAMMI TROYER\nStudent\nwages of $25,000 a year, or 12 dollars an hour. If their demands were met, Walmart employees would be financially secured above the poverty line.   Walmart Corporate's response to Our Walmart's demonstrations show troubling contradictions. On their Facebook and Tumblr pages, OUR Walmart claims employees involved in the protests had been fired or had some form of disciplinary action taken against\n28 11.13\n•\nJERK\nthem, but Walmart Corporate denies these claims. Spokesman Dan Fogleman says OUR Walmart is actually a front for Walmart’s competition to attack the corporation and publicly defame Walmart.   And even if some of their employees did participate in the protests, it was a small number and does not represent the opinion of the majority of its workers. “It’s a little bit of a bloody fight sometimes and as a worker you wonder if it’s worth it,” Dutkowsky says, commenting on the situation at Walmart.   Senior Rachel Ahart, a social work major, keeps a list of horror stories from her past job as a cashier at a restaurant, making only $5.25 an hour and a few dollars in tips each night. For her, minimum wage isn’t just barely survivable, but not an appropriate amount for the demands workers have to meet. Bosses often run minimum wage workers ragged, squeezing out every morsel of work they can. Because most of these are service jobs, they require their employees to interact with customers, who can be rude and impatient— something that Walmart employee, Cydney Ward, resents.   Ward cashes out a woman and son purchasing large bags of cereal. Ward bags the cereal, but a couple inches of one of the packages jutts out. The woman called Ward incompetent and lacks common sense. She demands to see the manager. Ward confesses the most difficult aspect of her job isn’t standing all day or bagging item after item, but “finding ways to be polite to people that are incredibly rude to you.”   The minimum wage sector is filled not only with students paying off loans and this week’s rent, but nearly four million other Americans. Workers, like Ward, who do jobs that are exhausting and monotonous, with difficult people, long shifts, sore feet, and little pay. Workers who must get up tomorrow, and do it again. JM\nJERK\nSMUT\nMARY THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT\nArtist Mary Giehl keeps the community warm—one hat, scarf, and pair of gloves at a time. By Nicole Fisher : Photos by Ilana Goldmeier\nGiehl sits in front of just a portion of the 750 items donated for\n“Connecting with Something Warm.”\n•\nJERK\nStuffed gallon-size Ziploc bags overflow from cardboard boxes in the corner of Mary Giehl’s self-built backyard art studio. Each bag holds knitted and crocheted items: scarves, hats and infant slippers varying in color, size, and design. Standing above the organized chaos, Giehl—wearing rounded glasses, a simple gray T-shirt, light wash jeans, and blue Crocs splattered with paint—searches for an example of excellent craftsmanship. “Oh, there it is,” she says, pulling out a knitted scarf embellished with rows of delicate white and yellow flowers and green stripes resembling grass. “Isn’t it beautiful?” she asks. Giehl folds up the scarf and places it back in the bag. Next, she pulls out a heather-gray structured hat with a cream-colored stripe around the middle. Giehl wishes she could keep the hat, one of 750 items scattered around her studio. According to her, however, that would defeat the purpose of her project. With a sigh and a smile, she repackages the chunky knit back into its designated bag. Giehl, a local installation artist and former Visual and Performing Arts professor at Syracuse University, never anticipated the feedback she received from her project,\n“Connecting with Something Warm.” Through this community-inspired project at ArtRage Gallery, Giehl has spent the last year collecting donations of yarn-made items contributed by local knitting guilds. Within the next month, Giehl will travel around downtown Syracuse, placing packages filled with pieces on city walkways, park benches, bus terminals, and other accessible areas where people can find these gifts. Each Ziploc bag also contains a postcard, which Giehl hopes the recipient will mail back to the gallery to explain how they encountered the items. Then, on Nov. 2, ArtRage Gallery will display the postcards as part of their exhibit, “Spoken Threads: the Art of Craftivism,” an exhibition of fiber social justice projects. As a collection of fiber art inspired by traditional craftsmanship, “Spoken Threads” and “Connecting with Something Warm” considers the impending Syracuse snowstorms—and the people who are left without the means to comfortably survive them. With over 400 homeless individuals and families living in emergency shelters in Onondaga County, Giehl’s project displays something more than just yarn. For Giehl, JERK\n•\n11.13 31\nSMUT it’s all about the connections, specifically the recipients and knitters who will be able to meet each other at the post card installation. ArtRage approached Giehl about the project since they knew of her expertise in fiber work from her previous work. Giehl was inspired by a project she worked on in 2004 called “Inner Light of Children.” The project happened when Giehl found herself with an excess of sewn Muslim children’s clothing protected by beeswax. Giehl built mannequin-like stands dressed in different outfits made from the clothing. Over 16 weeks, she left three structures at a time in bus shelters around the city of Syracuse, with an attached postcard that asked individuals to name the structures and then send the postcard back to Giehl. The postcards were then arranged in a window downtown next to images of the figures around the city. For “Connecting with Something Warm, ”Giehl contacted multiple knitting groups around the Syracuse area. She attended their meetings, explained the project, and asked for their assistance. Around a year ago, Giehl contacted Deborah Gardner, a member of The Knitting Guild Association who attends the Northern Onondaga Public Library Knitters meeting each week. Giehl attended a meeting to explain the project to the group and after that, Giehl kept coming back. “I was supposed to be the drop-off person for the group, but Mary enjoyed our group so much she kept coming back for more,” Gardner says. Most of the Northern Onondaga Public Library Knitters donated around two items each, but some members asked others to contribute as well. “I even used the project to barter with someone,” Garnder says. “I had a couple of books I wanted to get rid of and a group of members wanted them. Instead of paying for them, I suggested she knit a scarf for Mary. She said ‘How about I make two?’” The project escalated after it received some attention from the press. When the Post Standard published an article about the project in July, the newspaper provided the community with Giehl’s contact information.\n32 11.13\n•\nJERK\nSince then, the project contributions have been overwhelming. One day over the summer, Giehl received an email asking her to pick up donations for the project from a house. She thought she would only be getting a couple of items. The woman sent 200. Donations to the project were not limited to the borders of Syracuse. Giehl, who has ties to North Carolina after completing an artist-inresidency project there, received two boxes of donations from a knitting group she attended while living there. Giehl was touched that the women who were part of the inspiration for the project wanted to help her reach her goal. The project inspired others to clear out their yarn collections. Giehl says that five or six women donated 15 to 25 items each. And when they said they were done, they would come back with two more items. Giehl even received a pair of infant’s socks in the mail made by a 96-year-old woman. Giehl says she can see the time that went into each item she receives. The creativity of the knitters and complex designs inspire her. One woman sent in six scarves that she made by thrifting old sweaters, unraveling them, and creating new scarves for the project from the salvaged yarn. Attached to each scarf was a handwritten label describing the type of fabric used. “She told me that each item only cost her two dollars, but how about the time she dedicated to the project?” Giehl asks. “I hope someone appreciates it.” Though some women in the knitting groups tear up over “Connecting with Something Warm,” not everyone was receptive to the project. A woman expressed her hatred of the project to Giehl. “It was tough for her to realize what was going on,” Giehl says. “As I continued to explain, she became more receptive but was still resistant.” The woman argued that it was disrespectful to the items and the women who made them to leave them at random locations. Giehl walked away feeling defeated, but waiting for her at the meeting the following week was a Pandora bracelet bag, with a crafted wine glass\n“SHE TOLD ME THAT EACH ITEM ONLY COST HER TWO DOLLARS, BUT HOW ABOUT THE TIME SHE DEDICATED TO THE PROJECT? I HOPE SOMEONE APPRECIATES IT.” —MARY GIEHL monogrammed ID tag around the handle. Also inside the bag: two delicate scarves and a note from the same woman. She had come around. The original goal for the project was to collect 500 items. A week before she started distributing packages, Giehl realized she surpassed that goal. Giehl hopes ArtRage is pleased with the turnout for the first stage of the project. “It is a unique community bonding experience and has the ability to impact many,” says Kimberly McCoy, the community engagement organizer at ArtRage. This project opened Giehl’s eyes to a generous and creative group she hopes to stay in touch with. “People love the idea of giving away knitted and crocheted items,” she explains. “They love to work with their hands and keep busy. These women and men contributing to the project are a\nunique bunch. They love the activity, the feel of fibers, and patterning. To them it is something they get immersed in.” On Oct.7, Mary drops off 20 scarves around Liverpool. She places an item on a bench and drops a pin on her Maps app at the location of the package. She walks away, unsure if the handmade items will find a home, but excited for the warmth they will bring.

As her name suggests, she shines in a tight, short dress, covered in flashy turquoise sequins. Her stiletto pumps highlight toned legs, and her thick, black, fake eyelashes would put Nicki Minaj to shame. Jazzi’s face—porcelain-like, thanks to layers of foundation—is framed by an amber-orange wig, which she whips off to reveal a buzz cut. Jazzi lifts her dress over her head. Her black bra lies against her flat chest, filled only by large, sewn-in pads. A club staffer points out that the Styrofoam pads tucked into her nude tights—her “hips”—need to be switched. She has mixed up her right hip with her left. She comments on how different girls’ bodies are from boys’ and how tough this makes her life; one only has so much time and money to spend. That’s why she makes most of her own attire. Jazzi is a regular performer at Trexx, an 18 and older nightclub and gay bar located at 323 N. Clinton St. in downtown Syracuse.

Any time I wear it I get compliments—the Rasta colors get a lot of people’s attention—and I get excited to tell people about [the organization]. It’s been a good way to meet friends.”\n“My brother got me into Dashboard Confessional. When he was over being emo, he passed down this shirt to me because he knew I was still into the band. I really don't mind wearing this shirt anywhere—I wear it out to parties and bars. Sometimes people say things, sometimes they don't, but it's really what I feel comfortable in so I want everyone to see it.”\n“I grew up on The Allman Brothers and Grateful Dead, and my dad and I would always sing ‘Blue Sky’ on car rides together. He passed away from cancer when I was a senior in high school. After his funeral, my sisters and I went through his dresser full of T-shirts. I chose the ones that were band shirts because they reminded me of him the most.”\n-Bridget Walsh\n•\nJERK\nThanks to meteorological uncertainty and uneven terrain, boots are the universal staple of a Syracuse University student’s wardrobe— contrary to the sea of orange T-shirts ESPN documents at every Carrier Dome event. But how, when, and why this footwear essential is executed on campus depends entirely on the social species of its owner. Take your classic black knee-high, for example. This shoe clings to the leggingclad limbs of a sorority sister like a rushing freshman desperate for a bid. Only one circumstance can separate her from those battered, beloved boots: rain, which requires the impenetrable olive-green veneer of the Hunter Wellington. Despite the presence of the somewhat pleasing design of the Hunter boot, nothing can diminish the overwhelming onslaught of ugly footwear that arrives on campus when inclement weather strikes. From late October to early May, duck boots, UGGs, and Sorels transform the non-Panhellenic student body into a shuffling mass of hobbit-footed mutants. From preppy frat boys trading in\ntheir Top-Siders for Timberlands to the ESF outdoorsmen who confuse campus for a camping expedition, wearing ugly boots is as prevalent at SU as Walden–filtered Instagrams of the Hall of Languages after the first snow fall. Only a select few avoid the horror every year, sacrificing warmth and comfort for a more attractive silhouette. Pairing Chelsea boots or Doc Martens with an oversized flannel, this group is comprised of the Visual and Performing Arts kids who spent the last six months debating the pros and cons of Hedi Slimane’s grunge collection for Saint Laurent. Want in on the conversation? Familiarize yourself with Isabel Marant, the fashion set’s go-to designer for that laid-back, Parisian cool-girl effect so desirable to the non-Gallic masses. Then swap your Steve Madden knock-offs for a pair of black fringe boots from Marant’s collaboration with H&M (launching in select stores and online Nov. 14) to bring some of that desperately needed French je ne sais quois to Cuse. JM\nJERK\nPHOTO CREDIT: http://bit.ly/19KPpjm\nWith recording agencies and on-campus Internet technology services slowly losing vigilance, illegal downloading has become...\nFor the last eight years, Joanna Weinberg one day a month sits down at her computer, opens up iTunes, and begins her search. She takes her $10 monthly allotment and starts at the Top Singles section. Thanks to iTunes raising prices an extra 30 cents, she has to settle for less than an album’s worth of her favorite songs from the last four weeks. She was an eighth grader in the summer of 2005, the same summer she joined MySpace with her friends. Incidentally, it was the same time she found out the 300 songs her Top Eight convinced her into downloading on LimeWire would rack up a total of $4,000. “It was kiddy stuff,” Weinberg, now a senior, says. “Like teeny boppers. No rap.” The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued Weinberg, opening a case not even her parents, both lawyers, were willing to fight. She fell victim to a crusade waged against music downloaders from 2003 through 2008, an era that saw only 50 authorized music providers in its early days. Approximately one in three people believed the music they downloaded was legal. By the end of the campaign, more users found the legal and more legitimate sources available. But increased legal access doesn’t equal a decrease in illegal downloading. Weinberg has since moved on and considers the suit another conversation starter. And while her wallet still reels from the indiscretion, she understands why others haven’t stopped. “There are so many outlets to get music for free,” she says. About five years ago, Syracuse University was a haven for illegal downloaders. Then, in\n2007, students and personnel were handed 37 settlement letters from the RIAA—the secondmost in the country behind Ohio University. That response, fueled by the growth of illegal services such as Napster and FrostWire, temporarily stalled on-campus activity. For senior Emma Smelkinson, subscribing to paid services such as Spotify Premium isn’t the same as filling her iPod. Whenever she can’t find what she needs, she’ll download it. Her latest find was the Arctic Monkeys’ AM. She scours the Internet and, from there, lets uTorrent, a popular bittorrent client, do the dirty work. Sure, there’s a fear of Trojans and viruses, but more underground sites are taking precaution to prove their trustworthiness. The Pirate Bay, for instance, remains one of Smelkinson’s favorites. One of the largest providers of bittorent downloads, the site color-codes uploaders with skulls and crossbones based on reliability— you're labeled pink if you're trusted, green if you're VIP. Such measurements placate anxious downloaders. “Totally worth it,” Smelkinson says, reflecting a general consensus among SU students who take what they need when it suits them. Advertising professors Brian Sheehan and James Tsao conducted a study published in 2009 that examined on-campus downloading. Titled “Motivations for Gratifications of Digital Music Piracy Among College Students,” their research found social utility as downloading’s primary driver and peer pressure as the catalyst for its escalation.\nJERK\n11.13 49\nNOISE\n“i think our culture is worse for the fact that people do something they know is wrong.” —BRIAN SHEEHAN Advertising Professor\nRIAA’s old sanctions may still live with the accused, but the majority of downloaders emerged untouched; getting through that time added an element of invincibility. “Everyone had a story of hearing of someone who got sued,” Sheehan says. In 2008, the RIAA ended its campaign of litigation against offenders like Weinberg. With new means of disseminating music, the industry can’t defend itself. A European Commission Joint Research Centre report published this year found illegal downloads boost legal purchases by two percent— justifying the RIAA’s move away from suing the average leecher. Now, the industry tries to push fans toward a legal marketplace, shifting focus from enforcement to education. RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth saw firsthand the power transfer to the Center for Copyright Information (CCI), an organization created in partnership with the motion picture industry. Under the new warning procedure, downloaders receive up to six warnings before suffering legal action. “We just let people know that this is going on,” Duckworth says. “Like, ‘Please stop—and here’s a place you can go to get legal music.’” The push toward legal services such as Spotify, iTunes, or Pandora coincides with the passage of the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), which puts universities under more pressure to protect copyright and enforce the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). This allows the RIAA to wash its hands of its former responsibilities. In 2009, they launched Why Music Matters,\n50 11.13\n•\nJERK\na website dedicated to presenting alternative options that pay content creators. Their mission focuses on educating the Internet users on what’s legal and illegal—a distinction that previous users such as Smelkinson, whose father introduced her to downloading with the server Kazaa, really needed. “At that point, I definitely wasn’t aware of the repercussions and didn’t think that peerfile sharing was illegal,” she says. While the RIAA has lessened its role in enforcement, SU’s Information Technology and Services remains watchful. If caught by a copyright holder, a student could potentially face greater consequences from ITS than from the CCI. But regardless, punishments have receded. According to Communications Manager Chris Finkle, ITS works to maintain the law of the land and ensure on-campus policies align with industry standards. He didn’t work at SU five years ago, but from stories he’s heard, taking further action was more common then. These days, five people, including the director, work for ITS’s Information Securities team. They spend most of their time securing the network and protecting it from hackers. Their jurisdiction, however, doesn’t extend beyond that. “There’s nobody sitting at a computer 24/7 looking at what’s going on over the network,” Finkle says. But when a copyright holder does send notice, the punishment follows the same protocol. Each time a student gets caught, they’re quarantined from the network, but with an opportunity to redeem themselves—if they meet certain requirements.\nStrike one: Read SU’s network policy and send an e-mail as proof of completion. Strike two: Make a mandatory appointment with the Director of Information Security for a counseling session. Strike three: You’re out. Not exactly, but repeat offenders will stand before Judicial Affairs, where they’ll have a strong chance of losing network privileges. Yet even that isn’t enough to break the habit. With ITS and RIAA backing off, a mindset of indifference over piracy laws among college students has replaced fear. Weinberg remembers her friends downloading off AirOrangeX without consequence, following the mentality of a high school prankster: If everyone does it, then no one can get in trouble. Though Sheehan remembers 2009, when a more prevalent unease over getting caught sat in the back of his students’ minds, popular attitude continues to evolve. “I think our culture is worse for the fact that people do something they know is wrong,” he says. “But they don’t care because they don’t think they are going to get caught. And everyone else says it’s okay.” A BBC study published last year ranks the United States as the top country for illegal music file transfers at nearly 97 million downloads nationwide. And decreasing government involvement won’t help curb the trend. Syracuse students have illegally downloaded since the birth of Napster and will continue to do so as long as AirOrangeX is up and running. In Joanna Weinberg’s eyes, they don’t care enough to worry anymore. “You don’t think about getting caught,” she says. “Not in 2013.” Take, for instance, an introductory communications law seminar. David Rubin stands before a lecture hall of 39 freshmen. As the former S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications dean, he’s well acquainted with his students’ on-campus habits. On the topic of illegal downloading, he throws it back to the room. “How many of you have done it?” he asks. Every hand goes up.

Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential tale of growing up, hating it, and wanting to run away. For those similarly-inclined, here’s why Holden Caulfield had it right about disappearing to New York City. 1. It’s the best place to lose yourself\n3. Doing adult things\nDon’t waste your patience with the lousy people at school. Instead, make like Holden and go to New York City, or The City as it’s called by anyone who matters. You’ll still be around people you can’t stand, but they won’t be able to stand you either, so at least you’ll have that in common. Stay away from that Yelp-approved restaurant on the corner of Such Street and Something Avenue; it’s phony anyway. In true Holden fashion, hit up seedy bar after seedy bar and meet hardened old men who can wax poetic with you about “the old days.”\nSo you’ve lost all joie de vivre. Now it’s time to enjoy the trappings of adulthood found in NYC. Grab an underage drink or two—preferably something with an amount of whiskey proportional to your sophistication. Befriend a barkeep, or seek comfort in the arms of a lady of the night. You don’t even need to do anything with said lady; just keep your hands to yourself and bask in a shared loss of innocence instead.\n2. The dark, gritty city aesthetic From the dank alleyways to the fuck yous scribbled on the walls, you’ll quickly realize that The City is as crummy as your outlook on life. But it’s perfect for you, a misunderstood and tortured youth with as much joy in your heart as insufficient funds on your MetroCard. Take the bleak cityscape and make it the place—your place—for reckless abandonment. Become the Chris McCandless of the concrete jungle, rent a rat-infested apartment on Avenue C, and let the darkness of pavement infiltrate your swollen heart.\n4. Endless source of nonexistent nostalgia Let’s face it: you’re not old enough to be nostalgic about much. The world today is about as messed up as it was when you were born. But nostalgia goes hand in hand with cynicism, and New York has no shortage of people yearning for days past. Head to Central Park and reminisce about your carefree childhood while watching children on the carousel. Consider the Natural History Museum, where, like Holden, you’ll likely find beauty in how everything—other than yourself—always stays the same.\nJane Eyre\nIt isn’t uncommon to feel a sense of empowerment after reading an impactful piece of writing. Early feminists novels, like Jane Eyre, have the power to inspire and change viewpoints through examples of fearless protagonists who rise above their conflicts and say fuck the patriarchy.\nIn this 1847 novel, the eponymous heroine asserts her own identity within a maledominated society—a notion well ahead of its time. Charlotte Brontë, under the penname Currer Bell, introduced 19th century readers to issues of sexuality, class, and religion lacking in other works. Jane only marries Mr. Rochester once she’s certain their marriage is a union between two equals, rather than upholding the submissive, Victorian woman stereotype.\nThe Scarlet Letter\nSet in 17th century Salem, Mass., Nathaniel Hawthorne’s historical drama chronicles Hester Prynne’s isolation in the aftermath of an adulterous affair. Though her public humiliation shows the inherent gendered double standards of Puritan America, Hester perseveres. She raises a child alone, supports herself and her daughter financially, and remains dignified even after her spirit has been crushed.\nThe Awakening\n“There was the hum of bees, and the musky odor of pinks filled the air”—this kind of atmospheric language defined Kate Chopin’s 1899 seminal novella. While vacationing in the Gulf of Mexico, Edna Pontellier struggles to embrace traditional motherhood alongside her radical ideas of femininity and social attitudes in the conservative South. With one novella, Chopin forcibly thrusts America into literary modernism, putting the written word toward a greater movement.\nMatilda\nA book before it was a movie before it was a Broadway show, this children’s novel— written by Roald Dahl, no less—proves females can be extraordinary no matter their age. Matilda stands up to bullies like her parents and principal, discovers telekinetic abilities, saves the school, and helps meek schoolteacher Miss Honey find her voice along the way. Pretty fierce for a grade school kid.\nThe Hunger Games\nKatniss Everdeen yells, “I volunteer as tribute!” and, in doing so, gives Millennials a heroine for our present and future. In the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, Katniss hunts to support her family before winning a televised death match that forces her to become a smarter and more lethal warrior than she already is. She even leads her male counterpart to survival, flipping the idea of typically male action heroes on its head.\nRomance novels have long been criticized as being formulaic when, in reality, they’ve evolved greatly from the precedent set by Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. Look below and guess the love story.\nTo the casual science fiction fan, there exist only Trekkies and Whovians—but diehard aficionados flock to these lesser-known sub-genres.\nFeminist sci-fI\nCYBERPUNKS\nResponsible for the misconception that sci-fi deals exclusively with the final frontier, the space opera took off in the 1940s and laid the foundation for a near-century of fandom afterward. Initially used as a pejorative term, the space opera emphasizes romance and adventure, sometimes drawing on western films for inspiration. E.E. Smith’s Lensman and Skylark series set the literary precedent for the genre, but it took until the early 1980s and the international success of Star Wars to propel space opera into the mainstream. Today’s space opera strays from romanticized storytelling, opting instead for a darker tone about the defeat— rather than the triumph— of mankind.\nInfusing science fiction with activism, feminist scifi offers thoughtful criticism by posing questions about women’s roles in society. This subgenre explores topics of gender and identity by creating dystopian or utopian roles where gender disparities are celebrated, reversed, or eradicated. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, for instance, helped spearhead the movement by dealing with the idea of asexual reproduction and retelling the story of creation. Other titles, such as Woman on the Edge of Time and The Female Man, challenged gender norms and helped demyth the “damsel in distress” stereotype. Beyond standard literature, however, feminist sci-fi gave birth to femspec, a comprehensive academic journal pushing to positively reinforce ethnic diversity within a genre that often excludes strong female characters and characters of color.\nBruce Bethke’s 1983 eponymous short story brought cyberpunk—a portmanteau of “cybernetics” and “punk”—into the lexicon. With a focus on high technology and low, rebellious street culture, cyberpunk hews close to reality, expanding on present-day fears of artificial intelligence sprawling too far out of control in the near future. Anti-heroes and marginalized populations abound in this postmodern, postindustrial landscape, combining film noir and dystopian qualities in works such as William Gibson’s Neuromancer. Other technoprogressive movements, such as steampunk and biopunk, exist in the same space.\n+\n+\n+\nANSWERS: 1.ROMEO AND JULIET 2. GONE WITH THE WIND 3. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN 4. GREAT GATSBY 5.

Bidirectional and never turned off, these voiceactivated flat panels push party ideologies and offer the government constant surveillance into private residences. Today’s televisions don’t spy on us, but they’re just short of the mark. The Xbox Kinect, for instance, is always listening when voice commands are activated. And with dictation programs such as SpeakWrite and Dragon, perfecting voice recognition to Orwellian standards is closer to reality than before.\nA mechanical device responsible for writing literature and music filled with Party groupthink, the versificator disseminates government-approved content generated free of human involvement. Its closest contemporary— the spambot—functions similarly, working off a specific directive and churning out relevant information. More so, machines capable of creating content indistinguishable from content generated by people already exist. Coupled with rapidly progressing artificial intelligence research, a real-life versificator may not be far off.\nIn Oceania, the Thought Police work in tandem with telescreens to monitor and punish the citizenry for thoughtcrimes opposing Party dogma. In the United States, PRISM—the National Security Agency’s (NSA) electronic surveillance program— requests data from companies like Google and Facebook, collecting intelligence first and analyzing it later to hunt down terrorist activity. What remains unclear, however, is the extent of NSA’s oversight, meaning all our private information could be floating around— government threat or not.\nREWIND\nWE HELP CRITIQUE POP CULTURE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO.\nALTRUIST\nFREDDIE MERCURY\nOne Direction By Daniel Taroy\nThe deal As it says in scripture: Before Justin, there was ‘N Sync. And a decade later, boy bands are as in vogue now as they were in their TRL glory days. Thanks to U.K. import One Direction, the legacy of five-part harmonies and shellacked hairdos has survived even our harshest pop-punk and EDM misgivings.\nBy Erin Kelly\nPHOTO CREDIT: http://bit.ly/190RjcO\nWE JUDGE\nQueen’s relevance outlives Mercury, proving that the essence and power of his legacy will never fade from music or the minds and hearts of his fans across the world. In fact, Freddie was voted 58th in a poll of the 100 \"Greatest Britons\" in 2002 and he wasn’t even born in England. Mercury ranked higher than J.K. Rowling, a queen in her own right—take that, Harry Potter.   Thanks to his influence, we have artists like Fun., who recreate theatrical pop-rock with lead singer Nate Ruess’ falsetto reminiscent of Mercury’s. Fun. even played with the remaining Queen members for a set at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas this September. And Lady Gaga credits her own dramatics to the late frontman, her stage name an ode to Queen’s, “Radio Gaga.”   Mercury once said, “I always knew I was a star, and now the rest of the world seems to agree with me.” We agree Freddie—you, and Queen are here to stay, and like your composition and style, your impact on music will continue to transform over the years, to come back better than before. JM\nPHOTO CREDIT: http://queenphotos.wordpress.com/page/40/\nFrom kid-friendly versions of “Under Pressure” and “Another One Bites the Dust” in Target’s back-to-school commercials, to Katy Perry’s new Killer Queen fragrance, to drunken “Bohemian Rhapsody” sing-a-longs at every family reunion, it’s impossible to escape Queen’s lasting influence. And with the remarkable vocal range and flamboyant personality of late frontman, Freddie Mercury, the band's legacy lives on.   Mercury redefined stage presence when Queen exploded onto the music scene in the 70s. With intelligent theatricality, ambiguous sexuality—glitter-doused unitards, anyone?—and the desire to take risks, Mercury turned rock ‘n’ roll into an art form.   But the show came to an abrupt halt on Nov. 24, 1991, when Mercury died of complications from AIDS just 24 hours after publicly acknowledging he had the disease. As one of the first celebrity casualties of the epidemic, Mercury’s death directed public attention to the illness, paving the way for the Mercury Phoenix Trust, an AIDS charity in Mercury’s memory.\nBoy bands, 1D included, have historically been marketed toward teenagers—teen girls, particularly. As with their predecessors, each member falls into one of the familiar tropes: The Hot One (Harry Styles), The Sensible One (Liam Payne), The Funny One (Louis Tomlinson), The Mysterious One (Zayn Malik), and The Innocent One (Niall Horan), making them infinitely more marketable to varying tastes. And from releasing a self-described “feminine fragrance” to inspiring scores of Future Mrs. Harry Styles shirts, the band’s intent is obvious. Even criticism of Directioners, including a British GQ article comparing fans to “knicker-wetting banshees,” focuses on a specific slice of the fanbase.\nThe (larger) issue Society likes its celebrities straight. To succeed otherwise, they must be funny (Ellen\nDegeneres), conventionally attractive(Matt Bomer), or completely hidden away (Lance Bass) to be as accessible and unthreatening as possible. For 1D, maintaining that safe image demands interview questions about ideal girlfriends, and tabloid speculation about trysts with the occasional model or pop star. Further fueling the fire are select tracks, such as “Diana” from this month’s Midnight Memories, which seem intended only for female fans.\nThe defense Too bad 1D doesn’t give a fuck. Call male Directioners gay, and Tomlinson will say, “Fans are fans,” regardless. Call Styles bisexual, and he’ll wear a flower crown and eat a candy thong off his bandmate onstage. In an industry and genre primarily defined by heterosexual representation, these boys stand apart. Of their five music videos released in the last year, not one included a love interest. And in concert, they switch to gender ambiguous pronouns, like you, instead of the gendered hers and shes, that normally fill their lyrics. Just as they’re candid about getting hair and makeup done, 1D is unafraid of camping it up with each other. Some might claim cultural disparity; even so, America could learn a thing or two about breaking gender norms from what Business Insider calls the “first billion-dollar boy band.” JM\nJERK\nBEN FIORE\nAMPLIFIED\nGuy Fawkes On Nov. 5, 1605, Guy Fawkes and his fellow conspirators attempted to blow up the English Parliament and that bastard, King James I of England. But the plot fizzled out before it even began and now, on this day every year, the people of England celebrate King James’ survival by burning an effigy of Guy Fawkes. Over here at Jerk we just like anarchy, so enjoy a few pieces of culture that celebrate political overhaul.\nWhere they're from: Liverpool, N.Y. • Members: Ben Fiore—vocals, guitar; Zach\nHayes—vocals, percussion, guitar; Ryan Burns—bass, guitar, mandolin • Active Since: 2003 • Sounds like: The bastard child of Matt Nathanson and The Script\nFILM: Oldboy\nWhat they Jerk to: The Goo Goo Dolls and singer-songwriters such as Jason Mraz, Joshua Radin, and—as Zach Hayes admits—Sara Bareilles. “Future wife—she doesn’t know it yet,” Hayes says. Best Song: “Circles,” originally released on the 2012 album of the same name, was so successful that the band collaborated with Fritz Sakran to make “Circles Remix.” The original acoustics and rough voice of lead singer Ben Fiore, paired with rap verses as well as synthesizer à la One Republic, create a sound that warps genres. Weirdest Gig: In addition to mistakenly headlining a drag show, the band also performed at Amy’s Slumber Party, radio station 93Q’s all-women business event. About 800 ladies with questionable BACs were quite taken with the men’s performance. One band member even had to be escorted\n60 11.13 • JERK\nout by police, wearing less clothes than he came in with. Why you should listen: With the unique flare of percussionist Hayes’ cajón, or box drum, the band’s inherent knack for acoustic covers, and their new hip-hop beat influence, their music takes the drab coffee shop/bar scene band and bumps it up to a new level for listeners. New Album: The Places We Will Go will be hip-hop influenced, more production-based, and better geared toward radio play. Expect the album's release this December. Where you can listen: Find them on iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, and their website, benfiore.com.

By Riddley Gemperlein-Schirm : Photos by Penelope Vasquez\n989 JAMES ST. SYRACUSE\nThe food truck operates a few days a week, spring through mid-fall. The deli is open year-round, Mon-Fri.\nSteve LeClair seasons the pork shoulder with a smattering of freshly cracked black pepper and sea salt. He blasts it on the stovetop over high heat, developing a deep-brown crust, then places in the oven for about 12 hours. The braised pork, cooked low-and-slow with house-made stock and mirepoix (chopped celery, onions, and carrots), emerges meltingly tender. “I love doing my braises,” says LeClair, owner and chef of Stevie’s Street Eats, located at 989 James St. “Everybody’s into that rib-sticking stuff.” Stuff like the pork shoulder, which LeClair might serve with basil and mascarpone whipped potatoes and gravy or as a teriyaki-style banh mi sandwich, topped with pickled vegetables and srirachasesame mayo. Street Eats began as a food truck in March of last year, and just seven months later, on Nov. 5, 2012, opened their deli at the Imperial Gardens apartment complex. Prior to opening Street Eats, LeClair served as a professional chef for more than 20 years before growing tired of the conventional restaurant scene. After noticing the rise of food trucks in bigger cities, LeClair, with the help of his wife Danielle, decided to open up his own truck. His thinking: “Syracuse has its share of hot dog carts and sausage sellers, how ‘bout I do something on the street here\n62 11.13 • JERK\nthat’s totally different than what everybody else is doing?” The truck—with menu items like fried calamari tacos, hand-cut fries, and half-pound Black Angus burgers—was a success from the get-go. So popular, LeClair would run out of food, and since he was doing his prep work in a shared kitchen on Westcott St., didn’t have the space to increase output. He needed his own established kitchen and with the truck closing for the winter, opening the deli was the perfect opportunity to expand Street Eats and keep customers happy. While the deli remains open year-round, the truck only operates May through midOctober. The deli and truck share the same concept: changing daily menus, using local and seasonal ingredients and making food from scratch and to order. Each night, the next day's menu is posted to the Street Eats' Facebook page, where its 2,000-plus followers wait to see what crazy-yet-harmonious combinations like “The Hammertime” sandwich, stuffed with candied ham, melted Wisconsin cheese, applewood smoked bacon, a fried egg, and sweet chili garlic compote, Street Eats will serve next. LeClair doesn’t get inspiration from other menus—he dreams it all up in his head, serving food he likes to eat. Food that, clearly, Street Eats customers love too.

So that year, his family moved to Syracuse to start a Syracuse University spirit-wear business on The Hill. Thirty-eight years later, Shirt World keeps us affectionately Cuse-clad, while simultaneously pursuing us on the street.\n1843-2013\nBy Paige Carlotti\nBy Leigh Miller : Photo by Penelope Vasquez So the guy who stands outside of the store— what’s up with him? I started it years ago to create the hysteria and charisma of the atmosphere. It’s kind of a double-edged sword. We want to connect with the people on Marshall Street and some people love it, some people don’t. I don't know how long we’re going to continue that. We’re trying to find the happy medium. Have you found it actually brings in sales? We’ve been here long enough that people know if they want the authentic, the original Syracuse garments, they’re gonna come up to The Hill. So our business hasn’t faltered if he’s not out there promoting it. Is there ever a time when the two-for-one sale isn’t going on? Not really cause there’s not much more you can do, whether it’s a buy-one-get-one or buy-one-get-something. Ya know? What’s your favorite T-shirt at Shirt World? “Real Men Wear Orange.” At 3 a.m. one night I’m sitting in bed and it hits me. I turn and tell my wife I have an amazing idea. She says to “go back to bed” ––I have ideas\n64 11.13 • JERK\nevery two minutes—but I say, What do you think about “Real Men Wear Orange?” The next morning we called our attorney, registered it and trademarked it. From around 1991 till now, and tens of thousands of T-shirts later, it’s become an iconic shirt of Syracuse. What’s the strangest thing you’ve witnessed on Marshall Street? In 1997, when we got into the Final Four, we looked outside our store and saw people from Haven and Walnut Park in the hundreds, maybe thousands, coming down in droves and said, “Wow, we gotta get out of here!” It’s like having the sea opening up and the water flooding onto Marshall Street. What makes Syracuse spirit unique? I’ll tell ya, I’ve been around this country, playing ball, traveling, and seeing different universities and colleges, and our students, fans, and this community are the best, most loyal, and most understanding. Because if we’re losing, our kids don’t jump off the bandwagon. They stay on there and they just keep moving forward. JM\nAfter battling social media-related illnesses for two years, Birthday Card went to heaven last month. Birthday Card lived a long, happy life—remembered for its creativity, ability to put a smile on anyone’s face no matter the distance, and knack for putting one’s feelings into words. Unfortunately, Birthday Card could not withstand the Internet’s ability to instantaneously connect people from great distances––which consequently took the life of its brother, Belated Birthday, as well. Birthday Card is preceded in death by Invitation and Thinking of You, and is survived by siblings Thank You, Graduation, and Sympathy. Birthday Card put forth a valiant effort, warding off Facebook wall posts, Twitter mentions, and Instagram collages with singing cards, voice-overs, and pop-ups. Overpriced pieces of paper, however, could not compete with the greater affordability of cyberspace during these tough economic times. Birthday Card began to show signs of life again with the invention of e-cards, but didn’t have the antibodies to fight the quickness, convenience, or personalization of digital best wishes. During its final years, shopping for Birthday Card became a chore for some and a hassle for many. Perusing the aisles of Hallmark required so much effort and wasted time overanalyzing the person’s hobbies, relationship status, and blood type—the list goes on. “Should I get the one with the puppies? She loves puppies, right? Or is she the one who’s allergic? Damn\nit, I can’t remember. I’m going with the flowers.” Before you know, it’s 10:30 p.m. and you’ve missed the first half of American Horror Story. When posting on someone’s Facebook wall, the biggest decision you have to make is how many exclamation points to tack on at the end, all whilst comfortably lounging in front of the TV. Though some argue that Facebook may be disingenuous compared to Birthday Card, Instagram’s birth in 2010 gave way for endless photo collages of you and your bestie, accompanied by a caption with hilarious inside jokes intricately woven throughout. I mean, come on—why spend money on a card showing a photograph of a stranger doing something funny when you can have a picture of the real drunk birthday bitch doing it herself last Friday?
