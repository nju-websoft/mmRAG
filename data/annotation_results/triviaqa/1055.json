        "\nDOCUMENT 1:\n\n... and the postal service of 2 nd-century Rome was akin to our postal service ... letters were carried by ... the first airmail route was inaugurated ... A Brief History of Air Mail | Airtug A Brief History of Air Mail | Airtug\nA Brief History of Air Mail\nPosted on June 8, 2016 in Blog\nIt all started a very long time, ago – there existed a sophisticated mail service in Ancient Rome; and the postal service of 2nd-century Rome was akin to our postal service today in that regardless of the weather or the circumstances, the mail would simply have to go through!  Horse-drawn carts meandered a good 50 miles per day over the masterfully-constructed roads that covered the sprawling Roman Empire.  Relay teams worked with one another, day and night, to ensure that the most important mail – usually political – would make a 170 mile trip within 24 hours!\n \nAs centuries passed, mail delivery became increasingly ‘sophisticated’; and the first aerial mail transportation occurred in 1870 in France.  Here, letters were carried by balloons cast adrift, guided by the wind.  It was on September of 1870 that 500 pounds of mail was carried, although the question remains:  Was the mail actually delivered?  With no way to control the balloons’ flights, the system was doomed shortly after its inception.  With that being said, however, balloon mail was also experimented with in 1877 in Nashville, Tennessee with, presumably, questionable results.\n \nIf we fast-forward to the 2nd decade of 20th-Century America, we find government-sponsored flights for domestic US Airmail which took place between 1911 and 1918.  It wasn’t until May 15 of 1918 that the first day of scheduled airmail came to be – the US Post Office Department officially established a new class of mail service – Air Mail was born!  On that date, the first airmail route was inaugurated between Washington DC and New York City.  The US Post Office Department had made an agreement with the War Department which would supply the planes and pilots while the Post Office would manage the mail and relevant details.  This historic flight carried 136 pounds of mail.  During a 76-day operation that followed, Air Service pilots delivered 20 tons of mail.  It should be noted, however, that of the initial 40 pilots, three died in flight crashes in a single year during 1919 and nine more crew died in 1920.\n \nTo further demonstrate the potential of utilizing aircraft for mail delivery, however, arrangements were made for a flight from San Francisco to New York City on February 22, 1921; and it was successful!  Including all stops, the flight took 33 hours and 21 minutes with an average speed of 104 mph, covering a distance of just over 2600 miles.  By 1924, transcontinental air mail delivery became serious business; and 5 years later, a total of 45 airlines were chosen for mail delivery.  The compensation for the carriers was a whopping $1.10 per mile!\n\n"
