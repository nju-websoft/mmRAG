Godzilla The Original Animated Series Vol 1 DVD  (NR)  +Movie Reviews\nHanna Barbera's 1970s Godzilla cartoon comes to DVD!\ngrundle2600 | Pittsburgh, PA | 04/12/2006\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\"This DVD is called \"Godzilla: The Original Animated Series Volume 1.\"\nI was born in 1971. So when Hanna Barbera's \"Godzilla\" cartoon came out in the late 1970s, I was the perfect age for its intended audience.\nThis show featured the Calico, a research ship that traveled all over the world. The Calico carried all sorts of scientific research equipment with it, as well as a minicopter, a minisub, a bathosphere, a hovercraft, and a lifeboat. The Calico's crew consisted of Captain Carl Majors, Dr. Quinn Darian (a research scientist), Brock (Dr. Darian's assistant), Pete (Dr. Darian's nephew), and Godzooky. Godzooky was apparently a younger relative of Godzilla. He was also Pete's pet.\nAlthough no episode of the show ever mentioned how the crew of the Calico became friends with Godzooky and Godzilla, it was mentioned in a press release when the show first aired: Godzooky was trapped in a coral reef, and he was rescued by the Calico's crew.\nAs the crew of the Calico traveled all over the world, they would encounter various monsters, creatures, bad guys, villains, enemies, etc. When they got in trouble, they could summon Godzilla by pressing a button on a small handheld signaler, which would emit a sonic frequency. Godzilla would then appear and save the day. When the signaler was unavailable, or broken, or when the sonic frequency was blocked, they could also call Godzilla by having Godzooky scream. Since Godzilla was a good guy, he would always do whatever he could to help them.\nThis show had lots of action, adventure, and heroism. In the 26 episodes of this series, there were monsters, dragons, dinosaurs, giant insects, volcanoes, time travel, aliens, spaceships, meteors, asteroids, missiles, tanks, and numerous references to classic science fiction and ancient mythology. The show had everything that a boy my age could ever ask for in a TV show. It was my favorite show at the time.\nI still love the show today. It's not my #1 favorite any more, but it is still in my top 10.\nClassic Media has issued a statement regarding the contents of this DVD. The episodes will be in chronological order, starting with the first episode of the series.\nThis DVD contains 4 episodes. They are:\nThe Fire Bird - A giant flying creature that lives inside a volcano is wreaking havoc for the people who live nearby. Godzilla has to stop the creature before it lays eggs. This is a good introduction to the series.\nThe Eartheater - San Francisco is being terrorized by a giant creature that lives underground and eats dirt. Buildings are collapsing all over the place. The entire city and its inhabitants are threatened. This is a very good early episode. Of the 4 episodes on this DVD, this one is my favorite.\nAttack Of The Stone Creatures - A pair of giant ancient stone creatures have come to life in Egypt. Their breath creates blizzards in the middle of the desert. This is a pretty good episode.\nThe Megavolt Monster - While doing scientific research in the bathosphere, Dr. Darian and Brock become trapped by several giant creatures that live in a giant air bubble at the bottom of the ocean. Godzilla carries Captain Majors and Pete down there to help rescue them inside his hand, which Captain Majors says is \"air tight and pressure proof.\" This is another good episode.\"\nFairly true to the Classic Godzilla movie series!!!!\nDanny Jerry | md | 06/10/2006\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\"This series is really one of Hanna-Barbera's best shows as the animation, writing and voice work is far superior to the other \"cookie-cutter\" produced shows the studio was churning out at the time. (Yogi's Space Race anyone?) It was originally presented under the title \"THE GODZILLA POWER HOUR\" (Not \"The Godzilla Show\") and was paired with a good adventure show called \"Jana of the Jungle\" (sadly not presented here) about  a Sheena type jungle-woman looking for her lost father. Ratings for this second half of the \"power hour\" were awful as kids tuned out after the Godzilla segment ended. So Jana was dropped after only three months and replaced with two older, already tested HB shows and the title was changed to \"GODZILLA SUPER 90\".\nLike many a movie series, once the box office has dried up, the next step is television. (That's right kiddies!! In ye olden days they used to turn successful movies into crappy TV shows. Not the other way around like it is now.)  Shaft, Planet of the Apes, Topper, The Thin Man.... The list goes on. Godzilla was no exception. The movie series had ended in Japan in 1975 but in America he was having a revival. Godzilla vs. Megalon had been widely ditributed to theatres in summer of 1976 by Cinema Shares, a low rent distribution company best known for handly Kung Fu movies, and been a smashing success. It was the first Godzilla film in the US since Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster in 1971. It was shown on NBC in a prime time slot the following year, hosted by John Belushi in a Godzilla suit and was a ratings grabber. 77-78 saw the release of  Godzilla on Monster Island, Godzilla vs the Cosmic Monster and Terror of Godzilla to weekend matinee's.  A Godzilla comic book from Marvel had started in 1977. Mattel, and some other companies also, released Godzilla toys such as the giant sized SHOGUN WARRIORS Godzilla and Rodan toys, \"Godzilla's Gang\" set of vinyl monster dolls, a UFO smashing \"Godzilla Game\" and a hugely popular bendie doll sold at Toys R Us  stores. Wonderland Records released an equally popular Godzilla record featuring two exciting, and new, audio adventures. Viewmaster reels ware available featuring a Marvel comics adventure in 3-D. Adding to Godzilla's career boon was the fact that  eleven Godzilla movies were in pretty heavy rotation on television. (Corporate free, infomercial free UHF, those were the days.)\nWith all this popularity, and no more Godzilla movies available for release in America, the time was obviously right for a Godzilla cartoon.\nAt this time, the US rites to the Godzilla character were owned by Henry Saperstein of United Productions of America company. The creators of Mr. Magoo and Gerald McBoingboing.  Saperstein had released Godzilla vs. the Thing and Godzilla's Revenge in North America through American International Pictures, held the television rites to Godzilla's latest and final film , Terror of Mechagodzilla, and had even bankrolled Monster Zero with Toho In Japan.  Saperstein licensed the character to\nHanna-Barbera and the animated series was born.\nMany Godzilla purists dislike the HB GODZILLA series, but I think it is pretty true to the character as he was being depicted by Toho at the time (Think Godzilla vs. Megalon), and was therefor a pretty logical progression. Some object to Godzillas physical appearance. It is obviously based on the famousAurora model kit, itself based on stills from King Kong vs. Godzilla.I happen to think that, given the limits of television produced animation at the time, its a farly faithful design.\nYes he doesn't have the movie Godzilla's voice. But I can understand\nwhy the animators probably didn't use it. I'm guessing they just didn't think about it. They weren't intentionally trying to disregard the original\nlike the @$$-h0les at Centropolis. They just made an honest mistake while otherwise trying to do the right thing.\nOthers dislike his breathing fire instead of his usual blue beam-like weapon. I think that this is splitting hares, since the breath weapon is described as \"fire\" in several\nof the early Japanese Godzilla films. I feel that the beam-like appearance was just a contrivance of the special effects available to Toho. Heck, in some scenes Godzilla would expell smoke, steam and fire extinguisher spray.\nAnd still others dont like the laser beam eye rays Godzilla has.\nI say,\" The more powers, the better\"!!!!!! Whose to say that Godzilla cantshoot lasers out of his eyes. I can beleive it. He can breath fire and atomic particles. He can fly and turn himself into a magnet. He can breath at the bottom of the ocean and on an alien planet. Godzilla is my hero and he can do anything. Even shoot lasers from his eyes.\nAs for the show itself. I think the plots are \"Right On\", Man.\nSome of the storys, most in fact, are simular to the Toho films. One episode in particular was very much like Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster.\nThere are many \"island adventure\" episodes like 'Sea Monster or Son of Godzilla. Some feature \"ancient evils\", such as giant monsters, returning after thousands of years of exile. Very much like some of Tohos monsters such as Megalon. There are alien invasion storys  Just as in Destroy All Monsters or Monster Zero. There is a giant robot episode even, and many of the monster designes look like they could have jumped right out of a Japanese film. The Forgotten Islands \"Cyclops\", Megavolt, Watchuka and Moonlode come to mind. Heck, there is even a giant turtle!!!\nThe show is basically a pretty fair continuation of where the films left\noff. No its not Toho, But its not Tri-Star either. So, be thankfull Godzilla fans.\nOn thing to look for on the DVD. The standard opening credits sequence\nhas been replaced on all the episodes by an alternate one that originally aired only at the beginning of the episode \"The TIme Dragons\"(believed to be the first episode produced) It is basically the same as the standard opening but at the end features a title card crediting Henry Saperstein and Toho pictures. This is entirely understandable really. No big deal\n\"\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nThis DVD is called \"Godzilla: The Original Animated Series ...

June 7 2013\nBy CWH1964 - Published on Amazon.com\nFormat: DVD Verified Purchase\nThe video is top notch on this first of three--what disappoints is the money-grabbing need to break up the first season into 3 DVD sets and then wonder why no one bought it.\nOther than that, this goofy 70's toon retains the Superfriends-style of bloodless action, complete with similar music and style, as a team of explorers get in way over their heads every time--but they have the best Pokemon of all--GODZILLA! Complete with flame breath and Laser Vision (!!!!), The Big G (voiced by Ted Cassidy) battles all manner of animated kaiju in style--aided by the cute, kid-friendly cross between Puff The Magic Dragon and Scooby-Doo, Godzooky. As if having a 20-ft tall dragon weren't enough. The stories even manage to squeak in some real science to appease parents who still, adhere to the need that toons need to educate.\nOverall, the four episodes are fun, but again, they could have done the whole season in one package.\n1 of 1 people found the following review helpful\n5.0 out of 5 stars Happy child Feb. 26 2014\nBy Kindle Customer - Published on Amazon.com\nFormat: DVD Verified Purchase\nMy son watched Godzilla on Netflix every chance he got; so when it was no longer on Netflix he was sad. He kept looking for it and asking me to put it back on there. I couldn't handle my child being sad and forever looking for something he watched every morning so I came where I near I'd find it. Amazon.com is my go to for almost everything. I had order this volume and the other one - after ordering it I told my son that I had a surprise for him that would be here very soon. Once it arrived I gave him both boxes, helped him open them and had a very happy camper.\nBoth DVD's works flawlessly. They have 3-4 series on them, all of which he watched over and over on Netflix. The only one that I can't seem to find is The Abominable Snowman (i believe that is the right name). Other than that he is very happy and so am I.\n3.0 out of 5 stars As much as I love me some giant monsters Dec 31 2016\nBy cmckittrick91 - Published on Amazon.com\nFormat: DVD Verified Purchase\nI have fond memories of this show so I decided to get at least the first DVD of the series. Classic HB style though it is a little slow. As much as I love me some giant monsters, I'd much rather be watching other Classic HB cartoons. Showed my son who loves his Godzilla toys ( too young for the movies) this show and he was uninterested as well. Perhaps the better episodes are on one of the other two volumes.\n1 of 1 people found the following review helpful\n5.0 out of 5 stars Classic late 70's from Hannah-Barbera Nov. 18 2014\nBy maurice - Published on Amazon.com\nFormat: DVD Verified Purchase\nThis was on Netflix streaming and my boys loved watching it (3.5 - 2 years old) then they took if off streaming, for the price and value you can't go wrong if you like the classic cartoons.  Godzooky is a crummy version of Scooby Doo but whatever his proportional size in every scene is always way off but it's a classic.  All in all my kids love it still, if you liked Scooby Doo and Superfriends this is another different but good series.\n2 of 2 people found the following review helpful\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nGodzilla is an American animated series co-produced by American animation ... her nephew Pete, her research ...

Godzilla - The Cartoon Network Wiki - Wikia Godzilla | The Cartoon Network Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nEnded\nWiki\nGodzilla is an American animated series co-produced by American animation company Hanna-Barbera Studios and the Japanese film company Toho in 1978 and aired on NBC in the United States and TV Tokyo in Japan. The series is an animated adaptation of the Japanese Godzilla films produced by Toho. The series continued to air until 1981, for a time airing in its own half-hour timeslot until its cancellation.\nGodzilla was packaged in many formats over its three year run from 1978 to 1981. These included The Godzilla Power Hour, The Godzilla Super 90, Godzilla, The Godzilla/Globetrotters Adventure Hour, The Godzilla/Dynomutt Hour, The Godzilla/Hong Kong Phooey Hour, and Godzilla. Godzilla appeared in reruns on Cartoon Network from 1993-2000 and in 2000, The series began airing on Cartoon Network's sister channel Boomerang .\nContents\n[ show ]\nOverview\nThe series follows the adventures of a team of scientists on the research vessel called the Calico, which is headed by Captain Carl Majors. The rest of the crew include scientist Dr. Quinn Darien, her nephew Pete, her research assistant Brock, and the ship's first mate, Carl. Also along for the ride is Godzooky, the \"cowardly cousin\" of Godzilla and Pete's best friend, who has a lighthearted role in the show. Godzooky can attempt to fly using the small wings under his arms. Whenever Godzooky tries to breathe fire, he usually just coughs up smoke.\nThe group often call upon Godzilla by using a special communicator when in peril, such as attacks by other giant monsters. Godzooky is also able to howl to summon Godzilla. Godzilla's size in the animated series shifts radically, sometimes within a single episode or even one scene. For instance, Godzilla's claw can wrap around a large ship, and only minutes later the team of scientists fit rather neatly on Godzilla's palm. In addition, Godzilla's trademark atomic breath is altered so he breathes simple fire. He can also shoot laser beams from his eyes much like Superman's heat vision.\nHanna-Barbera was unable to use Godzilla's trademark roar, so they cast Ted Cassidy to voice the character, similar to his role in the live-action series The Incredible Hulk.\nEach episode would include a brief exposition on a scientific instrument or phenomenon, thus providing an educational segment for the show.\nCast\nGodzilla originally aired in the following formats on NBC:\nThe Godzilla Power Hour (September 8, 1978 – October 28, 1978)\nThe Godzilla Super 90 (November 4, 1978 – September 1, 1979)\nGodzilla (September 8, 1979 – October 13, 1979)\nThe Godzilla/Globetrotters Adventure Hour (October 20, 1979 – September 20, 1980)\nThe Godzilla/Dynomutt Hour (September 27, 1980 – November 15, 1980)\nThe Godzilla/Hong Kong Phooey Hour (November 22, 1980 – May 16, 1981)\nGodzilla (May 23, 1981 – September 5, 1981)\nThe Godzilla Power Hour consisted of half-hour episodes of Godzilla and Jana of the Jungle . A total of 13 original episodes were produced in 1978, with the first eight airing as part of The Godzilla Power Hour. In November 1978, the show was expanded to 90 minutes with the addition of Jonny Quest reruns and retitled The Godzilla Super 90.\nFor the second season beginning in September 1979, the show was separated from its package programs and aired in its own half-hour timeslot as simply Godzilla. A month later, new episodes of Godzilla and The Super Globetrotters were packaged together as The Godzilla/Globetrotters Adventure Hour which ran until September 1980.\nOn September 27, 1980, after 26 half-hour episodes, the show went into reruns and Godzilla was once again teamed up with other Hanna-Barbera characters: The Godzilla/ Dynomutt Hour ran until November 1980, followed by The Godzilla/ Hong Kong Phooey Hour which ran until May 16, 1981. On May 23, the show returned to the half-hour format as Godzilla and the last regular showing aired on September 5, 1981 (to be replaced by The Smurfs , which would last three times as long). Throughout the 1980s until the late-1990s, the series rested in limbo (with the exception of a limited videocassette release of two episodes). Since 1993, it has been rebroadcast on TNT , Cartoon Network and Boomerang .\nEpisodes\n26. \"The Deadly Asteroid\"\nIn Other Media\nIn response to the Y2K hype, Cartoon Network created a short (\"Godzilla vs. the Y2K Bug\") in which the Calico is attacked by a personified Y2K Bug. The Godzilla calling device is useless because the crew forgot to update the embedded microchip.\nProfessor Quinn Darien appeared as Dr. Gale Melody, a music expert, in the Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law episode \"Shoyu Weenie\" voiced by Grey DeLisle .\nHome Release\nAll 13 Godzilla episodes from the first season have been released on DVD, in 3 separate volumes titled Godzilla: The Original Animated Series. Volume 1 contains the first 4 episodes, volume 2 contains the next 4, and volume 3 contains the next 5.\nAs of November 9, 2011, all episodes of season 1 are also streaming on Netflix and available to view on Hulu.\nHanna-Barbera Series\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\n30min | Animation, Adventure, Family | TV Series (1978–1980) Episode Guide. 26 ...

Apparently, a pact was made that if the crew took care of the little guy, Godzilla would help if they needed him. As it turns out, this was a most fortuitous thing, because in the voyages of the Calico, they investigate mysteries that all too often lead to run-ins with dangerous giant beasts. With no way to battle the beasts themselves, the crew, either through a special signaling device or Godzooky calling himself, can summon Godzilla seemingly from anywhere around the world to confront the menace at hand.

In some shots, he can hold the crew of the Calico ship in his hand, while in others, he's so big that he can grab the entire ship.

This show just really outlines a problem in my book, us Americans strange need to make Godzilla into something he is not. We never make him look like the Japanese version, we mess with how strong he is and we generally seem to want to name stuff Godzilla when they just are not Godzilla. Even the movie which was rather bad at least got his roar right, this does not even do that. They add a stupid monster named Gadzooky too which is a real annoyance, but then again the Japanese do have a baby Godzilla that would be seriously lame in \"Godzilla's Revenge\". Still the idea of Godzilla being summoned like an attack dog or something is rather lame too, though they sort of did that in \"Godzilla vs Megalon\", however in most of the movies even where he is good he comes of his on accord. The fights in this series are sorely lacking as well as I find it rather pathetic that the fights in the live action movies are better, more epic than a cartoon show. I mean it is animation, you are not bound to the laws of physics and stuff you can do anything and most of the battles are horrible. And why does Godzilla always blow fire in America, in Japan it is a radioactive breath, here he always breaths fire, he is not a dragon, but then the fact they remove his cool back plates and make his head bigger he does look more like a dragon than Godzilla and Gadzooky most certainly looks like one.\n3 of 9 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\n\n"
