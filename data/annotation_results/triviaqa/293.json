But they kept at it, pushing themselves and their aircraft to the limits in pursuit of a dream.\n\"Both Steve and I love a challenge,\" Kasprowicz told us. \"We figured flying around the world was pretty big.\"\nKasprowicz is an aircraft junkie with 30 years of experience who knows his way around a chopper. Earlier this year, he and Sheik flew from New York to Los Angeles in 15 hours, 9 minutes and 10 seconds to set a new transcontinental helicopter-speed record.\nHe got the idea for a round-the-world helicopter run two years ago when he first saw the  AgustaWestland Grand and its two Pratt & Whitney PW207C\nTurboshaft engines. With a range of 575 miles and a maximum cruising speed of 175 mph, it is, Kasporwicz says, unparalleled in sophistication and performance. \"I knew that if there was a rotorcraft that could help me break some records, it would be the Grand,\" he told us.\nBut he and Sheik didn’t want to just break the record, they wanted to obliterate it and do it in a bone-stock chopper. The record they were gunning for — 17 days, 6 hours, 14 minutes and 25 seconds — was set 12 years ago in a Bell 430 outfitted with an extra fuel tank, a bunk and other mods.\nThe Grand Adventure 2008 started August 7 in New York and followed a carefully plotted course that took them 20,000 nautical miles — roughly the circumference of Earth at the Tropic of Cancer — around the world to the east. They steered clear of the polar regions and avoided commercial airports to avoid landing and refueling delays.\nThe first week went off without a hitch. Kasprowicz and\nSheik made it from New York to London in a stunning 40 hours and 41 minutes, shattering the previous record by a whopping 35 hours. Europe was a piece of cake, but Russia — as they expected — was a bear.\nThey arrived on the 13th, but construction at one airport and a fuel shortage at another cost them almost a full day. Things went from bad to worse after taking off from the Siberian city of Magadan — the oil temperature in one of the copter’s two engines rose so high Kasprowicz had to shut it down to avert crippling damage. They finally sorted things out with some help from local mechanics, but they lost still more precious time.\n\"Russia was probably the most stressful part of the trip,\"\nKasprowicz says. \"If I had to pick the biggest challenge, that would probably be it.\"\nThey made up for it after crossing the Bering Sea and reaching North America, pulling out all the stops on a mad dash across North America and handily beating the record Ron Bower and John Williams set in 1996. We still don’t have an official time — the folks organizing the Grand Adventure say it’s got to be confirmed and won’t be available until tonight.\nAs for Kasprowicz, he says he’s never been so exhausted and ready for some serious sack time. Then he’ll figure out what’s next. \"Round the world is pretty big,\" he says. \"I’ve got some ideas, but for now I just want to go home.\"\nPhotos by Grand Adventure 2008.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n... helicopter pilot Ron Bower knows he's going to set a ... the Clock 2 Flying Copter around the World in ...

So all we have to do to set the record is just arrive.\"\nHe and co-pilot John Williams, a fellow Texan, began their journey Aug. 17 in London. If all goes well - and Bower is sure it will - they'll return to London on Sept. 2.\nThat's 16 days on the calendar, but only 15 days in flight. \"We'll go across the International Date Line and gain a day,\" Bower said. \"They time it from leaving London to arriving in London, so it'll count as 16 days.\"\nBower already holds the west-to-east record - 24 days, set in 1994 aboard a Bell JetRanger. \"I beat H. Ross Perot Jr., who did it in 29 days back in 1982,\" Bower said as ground crewmen at Spirit of St. Louis Airport refueled his helicopter in a brief stop.\nThis time out, Bower is flying a Bell 430 - a new model just certified this year. Its long range (600 miles) and high cruising speed (165 miles an hour) allow him to fly the \"wrong\" way - east to west, against the prevailing wind.\n\"The hardest part is over,\" he said. That was the Atlantic leg, flown from Britain to Iceland to Greenland to Canada.\nThe Pacific leg will be extremely brief - a hop across the Bering Strait from Alaska to Russia's Siberia.\nThe total distance is 20,500 miles - the circumference of Earth at the Tropic of Cancer.\nTo make up for shortcuts like the Bering Strait, Bower and Williams are taking a meandering route across North America, covering all 48 continental states. …\nSubscribe to Questia and enjoy:\nFull access to this article and over 10 million more from academic journals, magazines, and newspapers\nOver 83,000 books\nAccess to powerful writing and research tools\nArticle details\nNewspapers\nEncyclopedia\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nRound-the-world speed record ... The previous round-the-world helicopter speed record has stood since 1996, when pilots Ron Bower and John Williams ... Round-the-world speed record falls to A109S | Business ... Round-the-world speed record falls to A109S | Business Aviation News: Aviation International News\nRound-the-world speed record falls to A109S\n - August 29, 2008, 1:25 PM\nThe around-the-world helicopter speed record fell hard on August 18.\nPilots Scott Kasprowicz and Steve Sheik flew a stock twin-engine 2007 AgustaWestland A109S Grand 20,078 miles in 11 days, 7 hours and 2 minutes, shattering the old record by 5 days and 23 hours and substantially beating their goal of breaking the old benchmark in 13 days. The pair beat the record without auxiliary fuel tanks, chase planes or an elaborate mission control center. En route they also set a new New York to London helicopter speed record, making the 3,449-nm trip in 40 hours, 41 minutes, breaking the current record by more than 35 hours.\nThe previous round-the-world helicopter speed record has stood since 1996, when pilots Ron Bower and John Williams flew a Bell 430–outfitted with auxiliary fuel tanks–20,508 miles in 17 days, 6 hours and 14 minutes.\nThe team departed New York La Guardia just after 3 a.m. on August 7. En route the helicopter underwent two 50-hour inspections–one at AW in Milan and one in Fairbanks, Alaska–as well as a major preflight conducted by AW tech rep Rey Sobretodo in Ironwood, Mich., early the morning of August 17.\nThe trip’s northern route took the pair from New York to Canada and then through Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Russia, Alaska and Western Canada before the crew took a circuitous route through the continental U.S. on its way back to La Guardia. En route there were 78 fuel stops and the crew reported encountering myriad weather and wind conditions, including icing and thunderstorms. Headwinds over Russia ranged up to 40 knots and tailwinds across the lower U.S. produced groundspeeds of more than 185 knots.\nThe crew had access to satellite weather en route, but that worked only in the U.S. The A109S was not equipped with weather radar and the instrument panel was largely stock save for a pair of Garmin GNS 530s.\nMechanically, the trip was uneventful except for a short, precautionary inflight shutdown of one of the helicopter’s twin fadec Pratt & Whitney Canada PW207C turboshaft engines over Russia. That came after a stuck bypass valve sent the oil temperature spiking to the “upper edge” of the operating range, according to Sobretodo, who was not aboard but flew commercial from Fairbanks to Ironwood.\nKasprowicz and Sheik flew on one engine approximately 70 miles before stopping in Severo Evensk, Russia.\nThere, after consulting with AW technical support, they changed the sticky valve from an elaborate parts cache aboard that included valves, belts, hoses, dampers, transducers and other “stuff we know that might break during a trip like this,” said Sobretodo. He added six ounces of engine oil at Ironwood but otherwise said the inspection was nominal.\nThe usually capacious four-seat passenger compartment of the Grand was piled high with parts, survival gear and a variety of dietary staples such as trail mix, energy bars and freeze-dried tuna.\nTravails of International Stops\nChanging the valve threw the trip schedule into chaos and could have cost the pilots the record, according to Harlan Hamlin, who served as the trip’s logistics coordinator from a makeshift control center in Peachtree City, Ga. The airports that dot sparsely populated Eastern Russia keep short and erratic hours, according to Hamlin. If the airport you are at is closed, you cannot take off. If the next airport you are going to is or will be closed by the time you get there, you cannot take off. Adding to the complexity, each flight segment within Russia had to be individually approved by the Foreign Office.\n“A lot of these places were cities officially closed to foreigners during the Cold War,” Kasprowicz explained. “In many ways, they are still cut off from everything.”\nThe team planned for difficulty traversing nine different time zones in Russia. It hired a Russian translator in Peachtree City, contracted with a Russian handling company, and the flight took aboard a Russian translator/navigator in Riga, Latvia, before it entered the country.\nThrough the handler or from a stash of rubles carried by the crew, it paid what Hamlin characterized as “large extended-hour fees” to Russian airports to stay open and keep things moving. But even all those measures could not guarantee success.\nA bureaucratic snafu grounded the team in Okhotsk for 22 hours on August 12.\nSheik spent 14 hours sleeping in the Grand’s baggage compartment while the navigator and Kasprowicz shared the only remaining room in a “very bad” hotel. Sheik, a former helicopter instructor pilot with the Maryland State Police, stayed with the helicopter in part to guard it. “There was really nothing out there [at the airport],” Kasprowicz said. “It was wide open.”\nOn August 15, Russia shut down a critical airway along the planned route, causing re-routing, significant delay, and a behind-schedule arrival at Anadyr, where, according to Hamlin, near-disaster again struck. “Somewhere in the Russian system, they were not letting us leave. Anadyr was getting ready to close in 30 minutes and was not going to open again until Monday [August 18].”\nHamlin put in a 911 call to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Embassy Security connected him to U.S. diplomat Aaron Fishman. “I don’t know what he did, but in ten minutes we were out of there,” Hamlin said. He said the episode caused him to “lose ten pounds and gain a lot of gray hair.”\nThe delayed departure from Anadyr triggered a significant change to the flight plan. The airport at the next scheduled Russian stop would be long closed so the team elected to re-enter the U.S. through Gambell, Alaska, a 600-person village on the Eastern tip of St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea. The airport there has no services or fuel.\nA Bering Air Beech 1900 was chartered to fly out three 55-gallon drums of jet-A and a pump. “Half the town came out to meet us,” said Kasprowicz. Authorities agreed to allow the team to refuel at Gambell before proceeding to Nome to clear Customs.\nFrom Nome the team pressed on to Fairbanks and the lower 48. On August 16, Hamlin started a quick-turn time competition between FBOs at the various fuel stops, offering Outback Steak House gift certificates to line personnel as inducements. It got the turn time down to less than 10 minutes.\nAt Ironwood, the team bunked at a local hotel for three hours while Sobretodo gave N1US one last going over on the moonlit ramp. It would be their last “prolonged” rest stop until arriving at La Guardia August 18.\nKasprowicz said he got the idea for the trip when he ordered his Grand in 2005. He said he and Sheik prepared for the trip through a “progression of long and difficult trips,” including flying the Grand back from the factory in Italy last summer and breaking the New York to Los Angeles transcontinental helicopter speed record in February (2,139.8 nm in 15 hours, 9 minutes, 10 seconds). When the trip began August 7 he had “just under 200” hours in the ship.\nAfter officially breaking the around-the-world record by landing at La Guardia, the team pressed on to AgustaWestland’s plant in Philadelphia for a celebratory lunch of pizza and cheesesteaks, then returned home to their base outside Washington, D.C. “We’re fried,” said Hamlin. “We’re standing on the ramp drinking champagne. Call me tomorrow.”\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nDuo Smashes Around-the-world Helo Speed Record. ... when pilots Ron Bower and John Williams flew a Bell 430, ... Round-the-world speed record falls to A109S.

Helicopter pilots Scott Kasprowicz and Steve Sheik flew a stock twin-engine 2007 AgustaWestland A109S Grand 20,078 miles in a little more than 11 days, shattering the old record by almost six days. The pair beat the record without auxiliary fuel tanks, chase airplanes or an elaborate mission control.

Kasprowicz and Sheik launched just after 3 a.m. on August 7. Their northerly route took them over the Atlantic, through Europe, Russia, Alaska and Western Canada before they began a circuitous route of the lower 48 states to amass the necessary mileage for the new record.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nRound-the-world-trip by helicopters: world record in ... just to set up a speed record but to make ... two Americans Ron Bower and John Williams circled the ...

Does Simon Oliphant-Jones still hold the Round-The-World Speed Record in his very bright MD500E?\n2. Is a non-stop Round-The-World helicopter flight feasible with current rotary-wing technology?\nIn theory, at least, it is. A Sikorsky MH-53E supported by a fleet of strategically-positioned Hercules air-to-air refuelers could do it. Four or five pairs of pilots could be carried to make sure everyone is getting some rest. The limiting factor is the helicopter and its engines and gearboxes. Could they sustain the continuous use they would likely face on such a flight? (OK, that's three questions!) Allegedly, the USMC ran their AH-1W Supercobras for 48 hours continuously with hot rearming, refuelling and crew changes back in 2003 during the early phases of OIF. I don't know if Richard Branson has a heli licence but he might be the guy to make such an adventure happen.\n500Fan.\nptflyer\n10th Aug 2008, 18:48\nHaving left Milan this morning they have flow to Graz in Austria, Lodz in Poland, Riga in Latvia then St Petersburg and Yaroslavl in Russia.

The absolute record remains the '96 Bell 430 flight by Ron Bower and John Williams, which was set Westbound (i.e. flying against the prevailing winds).\n2. Is a non-stop Round-The-World helicopter flight feasible with current rotary-wing technology?\nShould be feasible.

Maybe the FAI changed the rules after the attempt - I don't know.\nThe following is posted of the FAI website outlining the requirements to be met for claiming the around the world record.\n5.3.5 SPEED AROUND THE WORLD (EASTBOUND AND WESTBOUND)\n5.3.5.1 The course, including the control points, shall be approved in advance by the NAC's concerned and must start and finish at the same place, crossing all meridians. The length of the course shall not be less than 36'787,559 kilometres (equal in length to the Tropic of Cancer).\n5.3.5.2 All control points must be at a latitude of less than 66 degrees 33 minutes (outside the North and South Frigid Zones).\n5.3.5.3 If due to circumstances the final landing cannot be made at the point of departure, the rotorcraft may be timed over the finish line on an alternate point lying beyong the original one (at a greater distance from which the start was made).\n5.3.5.4 Intermediate landing places, turn or control points must be declared and agreed in advance with the NACs concerned.\n5.3.5.5 Any time spent on the ground between start and finish shall be counted as flying time.\n5.3.5.6 Refuelling on the ground or in flights is permitted.\n5.3.5.7 Repair or replacements of parts of the rotorcrafts rotors and engine(s) are permitted except that the winglets and fuselage may not be changed.\n5.3.5.8 Crew members may not be changed during the attempt. However, in the casse of an emergency a crew member, other than the pilot-in-command, may leave but must not be replaced. Passengers may be changed during the attempt.\nAnyone got a definitive answer?\nEPacH\n15th Aug 2008, 13:05\nSimon O-H 's record was and is the official single pilot eastbound record as recognized by the FAI. :D This is the one that beat Ron Bower's Jetranger record with Simon O-H in a very elderley 500E. Ron Bower's two pilot two engine record, in the Bell 430, is the official westbound record (i.e against the prevailing winds).\nChalkers1\n15th Aug 2008, 18:31\nptflyer:\nThink you confusing Simon OH's trip with another attempt. A know that a crew much earlier did try it that way around, but like you correctly state - it falls outside the regs set by the FAI. Simons trip ticked all the boxes, his highest lattitude being N65.34 at Kulusuk, Greenland.\nSimons record stands at 17d, 14h, 2m\nThe FAI also subcategorize the attempt into different weight categories, Rons and Simons Eastbound trips are in Cat C, the Grand is in Cat E. So officially they are different records.\nThe Grand website states their trip is an attempt to break Rons time of 17d, 6h which was westbound. So I have to admit i'm a little confused as I understood the records are considered separate between westbound and eastbound? But regardless, they are doing a very impressive job with a difficult task. Good on them!\nptflyer\nChalkers1 and EPacH\nThanks for clarifying that.\nI was confusing this with the 13.5 day flight by Stephen Good and Michael Smith, also in a Hughes 500, that did go up to near the North Pole in July/August 1997, which would not comply with the FAI requirements as they are written now.\nexlatccatsa\n19th Aug 2008, 10:07\nN1US new record 11 days 7 hours 3 minutes.. beating the previous by  5  days 23 hours 10 minutes.. 20078miles in 271 hours average speed 74.1 kts!!\nForum :: The Grand Adventure :: Round the World Helicopter Record 2008 (http://www.grandadventure08.com/forum/)\nBrilliant Stuff\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\nHe won the inaugural Grand Prix motorcycle racing 500 cc World ... 1953 to set a number of world speed records at ... 1956 World Champion, John Surtees ...

Tommaso Omobono Tenni (July 24, 1905 - June 30, 1948) was an Italian motorcycle road racer. Nicknamed The Black Devil, he was a multiple Italian Motor Cycle champion, who raced to 47 victories for Moto Guzzi from 1933 till 1948, the year he died from an accident during practice for the Swiss GP. Omobono Tenni was born in Tirano, Lombardy. When he was 15, his family moved to Treviso, where he began an apprenticeship at a motorcycle workshop. At 19, he opened his own workshop and began his racing career. His first victory was in 1924, at the end of his teenage years. It was not until 1931 that members of his local club contributed so that he could purchase a Velocette 350 with which he finished in third place at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza followed by a victory at the Grand Prix Reale of Rome. In 1932, he won a race at Rapallo against Moto Guzzi's star rider, Pietro Ghersi. His performance earned him a spot on the Moto Guzzi team for the 1933 season. For the 1934 season, Moto Guzzi developed a new V twin 500 cc racer and Tenni rode it to victory at the Italian Grand Prix ahead of his team-mate Stanley Woods. He would go on to win the 1934 Italian 500 cc national championship. Tenni first travelled to the Isle of Man TT in 1935. For a newcomer, he performed remarkably well. He was lying in second to his team-mate Woods, when he crashed in a fog bank on the mountain section. It was here that he came to be dubbed the Black Devil referring both to the color of his hair and his diabolical riding style. He would again capture the 500 cc Italian National Championship in 1935. The highlight of his career was winning the Lightweight at the 1937 Isle of Man TT, becoming the first Italian to win the TT. In 1937 he also won the 250cc European Championship. He suffered serious injuries in the 1938 and 1940 seasons then his racing career was put on hold by World War II. After the war, he began racing again, claiming his fourth Italian 500 cc championship in 1947. He put in a respectable performance at the 1948 Isle of Man TT where he set the race's fastest lap and led the race before mechanical difficulties forced him back to ninth place. Omobono Tenni had 47 victories racing for Moto Guzzi in the period from 1933 to 1948. \n(Click on thumbnail for more detail)\nBen DRINKWATER - Junior TT, 1949, Isle of Man. Reuben Thomas 'Ben' Drinkwater (13 February 1910 - 9 June 1949) born in Rochdale, Lancashire, England a railway signalman and motor-cycle racer who competed in the Isle of Man TT Races and the Manx Grand Prix. After competing in the 1946 Manx Grand Prix the first post-war event on the Snaefell Mountain Course, Ben Drinkwater returned to race in the 1947 Isle of Man TT races and finished in 3rd place in the controversial 1947 250cc Lightweight TT Race won by Manliff Barrington. While racing in the 1949 350cc Junior TT Race, the first ever race of the new FIM World Championship, Drinkwater collided with a bank trying to avoid a fellow competitor near Cronk Bane farm near the 11th milestone marker post and was killed. The distinctive S-bend corner on the Isle of Man Mountain Course near to where the accident occurred was renamed \"Drinkwater's Bend\" or the 11th Milestone.\nClick on thumbnail to enlarge\nGeorge Henry TAYLOR - sidecar - October 1949\n-\n Brands Hatch - at a special race meeting that was to raise money for a fellow rider's widow and family.  His passenger, Donald Overall, escaped with injuries.

Malcolm David Whitworth (1904 — 3 July 1950) was a British motorcycle racer. Denied the chance to race abroad by World War II, Whitworth computed in numerous races in the United Kingdom. In 1935 and 1936 he competed in the Manx Grand Prix, but retired both times. In 1937 he competed in the Isle of Man TT for the first time, which was thought at the time to be the toughest race in the world. In the 250 cc Lightweight TT race, he competed on a Cotton motorcycle but failed to finish. He failed to finish in 1938 as well, but in the 350 cc Junior TT he came sixth on a Velocette. In the 500 cc race at the Ulster Grand Prix he finished third, behind Jock West and Ginger Wood. In 1939 he finished fifth in the Junior TT and twelfth in the 500 cc Senior TT, in which he competed for the first time. In the first post-war TT in 1947, Whitworth finished second to his team mate, Bob Foster, in the Junior TT, the best TT result of his career. He retired from the Senior TT race. In 1949, Whitworth took part in the newly created World Championship. At both the Dutch TT and the Belgian Grand Prix, Whitworth finished fourth in the 350 cc class resulting in sixth place in the overall championship standings. Outside of the championship, Whitworth won the 350 cc race at the French Grand Prix in Saint-Gaudens. In the 1950 season, Whitworth took eleventh and nineteenth places in the Junior and Senior TT respectively. For the Senior TT, he competed for the first time as a works rider, for Triumph. On 2 July 1950, Whitworth competed in the 350 cc Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps. He was riding a privately entered Velocette and was in a fight for fifth place with Harold Daniell, Ted Frend and Charlie Salt. On the tenth lap, Whitworth and Salt came together, crashing heavily. The following day, Whitworth died in hospital from his injuries. In accordance with his wishes, which were to be buried close to the scene of any fatal accident he might have, he was buried in the local cemetery in Spa.\nDario AMBROSINI - French  GP 250 1951, Albi. Dario Ambrosini (March 7, 1918 in Cesena - July 15, 1951 in Albi) was an Italian Grand Prix motorcycle road racer who competed for the Benelli factory racing team. He finished second to Bruno Ruffo in the inaugural FIM 250cc world championship in 1949. He returned in 1950 and claimed the 250cc world championship with three victories including one at the 1950 Isle of Man TT. Ambrosini was killed during official practice for the 1951 French Grand Prix at Albi.\nClick on  thumbnails to enlarge a bit\nGianni LEONI - Ulster TT 125cc, 12 August 1951, Clady - Gianni Leoni and Sante Geminiani, both riders of the Moto Guzzi team, were killed in a tragic accident during testing.  The two riders were at the track together with their team mate Enrico Lorenzetti. Geminiani and Lorenzetti made a  pit stop to change machines. Leoni, worried that his team mates had crashed went back to look for them. Meanwhile Geminiani and Lorenzetti had left the pits and were travelling at speed when they collided head on with Leoni. Sante Geminiani was killed instantly. Gianni Leoni recovered his feet; but later died in hospital in Belfast. Enrico Lorenzetti sustained only minor injuries.  Despite the tragic death of two of its factory riders and another injured, team Moto Guzzi did not withdraw from the race and the following day the works rider Bruno Ruffo won the Ulster Grand Prix 250 cm3 class in a Moto Guzzi. Gianni Leoni, 35yo from Como, had finished 2nd in the 125 World Championship 125 class in 1950 behind Ruffo and in 1951 behind Carlo Ubbiali, riding a FB-Mondial 125. At the time of his death he was second in points in the 125 World Championship class and fourth in the 250.\n(Thanks to Jan Ebeltjes for the pic) \nSante GEMINIANI - Ulster TT 125cc, 12 August 1951, Clady - see details of incident above. Sante Geminiani (b. September 4, 1919) was an Italian Grand Prix motorcycle road racer. Born in Lugo in the Emilia-Romagna, he began his professional Grand Prix racing career in 1949 riding for the Moto Guzzi factory racing team. Gemiani finished in third place behind the dominant Gilera factory teammates, Geoff Duke and Alfredo Milani in the 1951 Belgian Grand Prix held at the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit. Geminiani was killed on August 15, 1951 after colliding with his Moto Guzzi teammate, Gianni Leoni, during practice for the Ulster Grand Prix held at the Clady Circuit in Northern Ireland.\nErcole FRIGERIO - Swiss GP sidecars 18 May 1952, Berne. Ercole was injured in a crash on the 15th lap at Tenni Turn - named after Omobono Tenni, who lost his life in that spot in practice for the 1948 Grand Prix of Switzerland. Frigerio died later in hospital on the same day.  Ercole was second in the World Sidecar Championships in 1949, 1950 and 1951, behind Eric Oliver's Norton. He had won the Swiss Grand Prix at Bremgarten in 1951 He was also the Italian sidecar champion in 1948, 1949 and 1950. (Thanks to Jan Ebeltjes for the pic)\nDave BENNETT - Swiss GP 500cc, 18 May 1952, Berne. Dave  was also injured when he crashed at the Tenni Turn. The 500cc GP began at a furious rate with Bennett in mid-field. It soon developed into a race of attrition. Duke’s Norton succumbed to faulty fuel. As the race progressed there were further retirements, Dave was the sole works Norton battling with the more experienced AJS duo of Doran and Brett. A fierce battle for the lead developed, changing repeatedly. As Doran and Brett sped past the pits on lap 27 there was no sign of Bennett. It was at first presumed that he too had suffered engine trouble, but in his efforts to stay with the AJS pair, he had run out of road, hit a tree and was killed instantly. Earlier that day Italian sidecar driver Ercole Frigerio had lost his life in an accident during the sidecar event in the very same place as Bennett crashed.\nHarry L.

He won the inaugural Grand Prix motorcycle racing 500 cc World Championship in 1949. Les Graham started racing at Liverpool's Stanley Speedway on dirt. In 1929 he entered a race on the Park Hall Oswestry circuit, riding a second hand Dot-JAP, and came second to Henry Pinnington on an AJS. For the next few years he raced a succession of Rudge hybrids with varying success. In 1936 he managed to purchase a near new 250 cc OHC OK-Supreme cheaply, because it had dropped a valve. He rebuilt it, and entered it in the 1936 Ulster Grand Prix. After completing a lap of the Clady Circuit, the big end seized. He rebuilt it for 1937, and entered Northern Ireland's North West 200, and lead the Lightweights for a while until he came off. He remounted, joined the field, and was running third behind a couple of Excelsiors, when the valve gear broke. He rebuilt the engine again, and won his next race at Donington Park. He then entered the Ulster Grand Prix, and came fourth. After this he was approached by John Humphries (the son of OK-Supreme's founder) to join the firm, and was given a job assembling the OHC engines. OK-Supreme produced short track racers with JAP engines. Les Graham, Andy McKay, and John Humphries soon became known as the Midlands trio of OK-JAP riders. In summer of 1938 they raced in the South Eastern Championships on Layhams Farm \"mountain mile\" grass track. Les took the 20 lap Matchless Trophy, setting a record in the process, despite never having competed on that track before. He came 12th in the 1938 Isle of Man TT Lightweight on an OK-Supreme. In 1939 he entered the IOM TT riding a Rudge engine Chris Tattersal St. Annes (CTS), and was running fourth on the second last lap, when the gearbox broke. Jock West was watching the race, and signed Les up to ride a Velo in 1940, but the War intervened, and that did not happen. Graham served as a pilot in the RAF during World War II. He was assigned to the 166 Squadron from 1940, flying Lancaster bombers over Germany. He attained the rank of Flight Lieutenant and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in December 1944 for bravery.[2] Afterwards, he flew with Transport Command, until he was demobilised in 1946.He had an invitation from Wing Commander J.M. (\"Jock\") West, OBE, to join sales and competition at Associated Motorcycles (AMC). Afterwards, he returned to racing in the late 1940s as a member of the AJS factory racing team. He competed privately at the first post war Cadwell Park meeting, on a Norton 350, and won. In 1947, on an AJS Porcupine, he managed 9th place in the Senior Isle of Man TT. In 1948 he managed a seventh in the Junior, but did not finish in the Senior. That year at Montlhery, Jock West, Les Graham, and French rider Georges Monneret broke 18 world records at speeds between 107 and 111 mph. The Motorcycle World Championships were first held in 1949, a year before the beginning of the four-wheeler Formula One World Championship. Les was the first winner of the prestigious 500 cc class, riding an AJS Porcupine. The Championship began with Graham leading by 90 seconds in the 1st round, at the 1949 Isle of Man TT. With only a few miles to go, the magneto drive sheared and he pushed home to finish 9th. He won round 2 at Bremgarten in Switzerland and set fastest lap (in year 1 fastest laps counted for 1 point). Round 3 was the Dutch TT where he finished 2nd to Nello Pagani. He failed to finish in round 4 at Spa in Belgium. Round 5 was the Ulster Grand Prix in which he was victorious and collected the fastest lap. The final round was held at Monza in Italy where local hero Nello Pagani on a Gilera won. A rider's best three finishes counted. Graham had 2 wins & a second, Pagani had 2 wins & a 3rd. Graham took the title even though Pagani's overall score was higher. In 1950, Graham finished 3rd behind Italian Umberto Masetti (Gilera) and new star Geoff Duke (Norton) of England. He also competed in the 1950 International Six Days Trial held in Wales on an AJS 350. In 1951, Count Domenico Agusta approached Graham to ride for MV Agusta. Frustrated by a lack of development with the AJS, he joined the Italian team to ride and develop their 500 cc four-cylinder machines. Graham failed to score points for MV in the 500 cc class. While the MVs were very powerful, the handling was not as well sorted, and the bikes were considered a \"handful\". Agusta were not competing in the 350 cc class, so Graham rode a Velocette MkVIII KTT 350 in competition, finishing 6th in class and winning the Swiss Grand Prix. He also finished 8th in the 125 cc class in 1951. For 1952, Graham began with no points in round 1 in Switzerland, 2nd in the Isle of Man TT though a missed gear change and subsequent loss of power undoubtedly robbed him of a win. Reg Armstrong (Ireland), riding a factory Norton took victory, a very lucky one with Armstrong's chain breaking as he crossed the finish line, with Les Graham 33.4 seconds behind. He failed to score points in the Dutch TT or the Belgian GP. He finished 4th with the fastest lap at Solitude in West Germany. He suffered another non-finish but fastest lap in the Ulster (Tyre tread problems with his Dunlops). He followed this with MV Agusta's first ever 500 cc win plus the fastest lap in front of an enthusiastic Italian crowd at Monza. This was followed by a second win in Spain. He finished the season second to Gilera's Umberto Masetti in the championship. In the 250 cc class, he finished 3rd using Velocette and Benelli machines and claimed 4th in the 125 cc class for MV Agusta. For 1953, Graham was the pre-season favorite and tipped to win the championship again. Alas, this was not to be. On the Thursday, he finally won an Isle of Man TT, winning the Lightweight 125 cc class for MV. In the Friday's Senior TT, he lost control of his bike at high speed, as he took the rise after the bottom of Bray Hill, and was killed instantly. Carlo Bandirola and the rest of the MV racing team withdrew from the Championship that year as a mark of respect.\nClick on thumbnail\nErnie RING - Belgian GP - 5 July 1953 - Spa. Ernie crashed his twin-cylinder AJS at the Cï¿½te de Burnenville on the third lap, being instantly killed.  Ernie had previously ridden at the IOM and also in GP events in West Germany and Ulster in 1952.\n(Pic: TTfan)\nDennis LASHMAR - German GP 500cc, 1954, Solitude. Dennis Lashmar (1927 – 1954) was the first rider sponsored by Gus Kuhn Motors. The company had obtained a Manx Norton and Dennis rode it in the 1952 Senior TT, finishing 30th. In 1951 he competed in three TT events, his best result being 13th in the Senior on Harold Daniell's Norton. In 1954 he was entered by Geoff Duke in both the Junior and Senior races on Pike-BSAs, finishing in both, though his LEF didn't finish the Ultra Lightweight race. Sadly, Dennis was killed in the penultimate lap of the 500cc German Grand Prix at Solitude near Stuttgart in July 1954 while riding a BSA.\nClick on thumbnail to enlarge\nGordon LAING - Belgian 350 GP 4 July 1954 - known as \"Manxie\" by friends, Gordon lost his life on a wet day during the 1954 Belgian Grand Prix, held at Spa-Francorchamps. Gordon,  25yo from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, had joined the Norton Team two weeks before, having his debut in the World Motorcycle Championship at the Ulster Grand Prix held at Dundrod. Gordon Laing tried to stay with Ray Amm who was battling for the lead with Kavanagh. While running in third place, Gordon Laing crashed at the flat-out La Carriï¿½re bend on his second lap. He was killed instantly. Fergus Anderson who was riding behind Laing at the time of his crash, lost five positions entering the pits to report the accident to the marshals. He eventually finished second in the race riding a Moto Guzzi, behind another Australian rider, his team mate Ken Kavanagh who was the winner.\n  \nL.

Rupert Hollaus (4 September 1931 in Traisen - 11 September 1954) was an Austrian Grand Prix motorcycle road racer who competed for the NSU factory racing team. He is the only Austrian to win a road racing World Championship. Hollaus began his Grand Prix career in the 1953 season. In the 1954 season, he dominated the 125cc class by winning the first four Grands Prix. Later that same year, he was killed in practice for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Hollaus became the first posthumous World Champion in 1954, in the 125cc class and was runner up to his NSU team-mate, Werner Haas, in the 250cc class.\nRay AMM - 1955 Imola. William Raymond Amm (10 December 1927 – 11 April 1955) was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, was a famous post-war motorcycle racer famous for two motorcycle Grand Prix wins and 3 wins at the Isle of Man TT Races in his career. After signing for the 1955 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season to ride for MV Agusta, Ray Amm was killed in his first race for MV Agusta in Italy in 1955.  For the 1952 Dutch TT, Ray Amm was a full member of the Norton team and was second to Geoff Duke in the 350cc Dutch TT and retired from the 500 cc race. At the 1952 German Grand Prix held at Solitude, Ray Amm crashed and broke a leg, returning later in the 1952 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season to win the 350 cc class for the 1952 Nations Grand Prix held at Monza in Italy. For the 1953 racing season, Ray Amm debuted the controversial Norton Kneeler 350cc motorcycle at the 1953 North West 200 Race. Despite overheating problems the Norton Kneeler with the nickname the \"Amm Sandwich\" or \"Silver-Fish\", Ray Amm finished in 9th place in the 350 cc class that was eventually won by Bob McIntyre at an average race speed of 86.86 mph. Despite testing the Norton Kneeler for practice for the 1953 Isle of Man TT Races, Ray Amm reverted back to the non-steamlined Norton motorcycles due to handling problems with cross-winds on the Mountain Section of the course and also opposition by the TT Race Scrutineers. It proved a good choice as Ray Amm won the 1953 Junior TT Race at an average race speed of 90.52 mph from Ken Kavanagh in 2nd place and Fergus Anderson in 3rd place. Another win in the 1953 Senior TT Race for Ray Amm at an average race speed of 93.85 mph completed a prestigious Junior/Senior TT double win for the works Norton team. Following Ray Amm during the 1953 Senior TT Race, Geoff Duke commented on Ray Amm's distinctive riding style;- \"After I had caught and passed Ray Amm on the Norton, he passed me at Ballugh when I missed a gearchange! Then there was the frightening experience of following him to the end of the lap, Ray could be pretty lurid when he was trying!\" A fall at the 1953 French Grand Prix at Rouen in the 350cc class broke a collar-bone and brought about a premature end to championship ambitions for Ray Amm for the 1953 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season. However, Ray Amm returned to the abortive Norton Kneeler project in November 1953 to set a number of world speed records at Montlhï¿½ry, France rasing the hour speed endurance record to a distance of 133.70 miles. Also at Montlhï¿½ry in November 1953, Ray Amm shared a streamlined Norton Sidecar outfit with Eric Oliver to set further speed records. Again riding for the works Norton in 1954 Isle of Man TT Races, despite leading the 1954 Junior TT a retirement on lap 5 for Ray Amm, allows Rod Coleman to become the first New Zealander to win a TT Race at an average race speed of 91.51 mph. The 1954 Senior TT race was delayed due to weather conditions and reduced visibility on the Mountain Section of the course. The race is held after a short delay and starts at mid-day. Despite the conditions, Geoff Duke riding the works Gilera and leads Ray Amm riding for Norton by 14 seconds on lap 1. On the second lap, Geoff Duke laps in 26 minutes and 23 seconds at an average speed of 86.97 mph and Ray Amm laps at an average speed of 86.49 to reduce the lead to just 2 seconds. Further heavy rain and low cloud on the Mountain Section reduces speed further and on lap 2 and Ray Amm uses \"feet-down\" tactics on the slower corners. Then Geoff Duke decides to refuel on lap 3 and Ray Amm in second place goes straight through without stopping and now leads Geoff Duke by 32 seconds. At the Windy Corner on lap 4, the visibility is down to 20 yards and a decision is made to stop the race because of the conditions. This allowed Ray Amm, due to refuel at the TT Grandstand on lap 4, to win the highly controversial 1954 Senior TT Race in 1 hour, 42 minutes and 46.8 seconds at an average race speed of 88.12 mph. The next event after the 1954 Isle of Man TT Races was the Ulster Grand Prix held at the Dundrod Circuit in Northern Ireland. In an event that was much affected by rain, Ray Amm won the 350 cc Ulster Grand Prix at an average race speed of 83.47 mph from Jack Brett in 2nd place and Bob McIntyre in 3rd place. The 500 cc Ulster Grand Prix was reduced from 27 laps to 15 laps due to heavy rain and again the race was won by Ray Amm at an average race speed of 83.87 mph, although later these result was excluded from the World Championship by the FIM. A further Grand Prix win in 1954 follows for Ray Amm with another 350 cc victory at the German Grand Prix held at Solitudering. At the end of the 1954 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season Ray Amm finished in 2nd place in both the 350 cc and 500 cc classifications behind world champions Fergus Anderson and Geoff Duke. Despite many offers Ray Amm finally moved from the works Norton motorcycles to the factory MV Agusta racing team. The debut race for Ray Amm and MV Agusta was to be the 1955 Easter Monday race meeting at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola, Italy. Riding a 350cc four-cylinder MV Agusta in the Coppa d'Oro Shell Race, Ray Amm lost control at the Rivazza Corner as he pursued Kavanagh and crashed in slippery conditions and died of his injuries on the way to hospital.\nDerek ENNETT - Ulster GP 350cc, 9 Aug 1956, Dundrod - Derek Ennett crashed near Budore on a works Moto Guzzi. Ennett had lost control after hitting a slippery patch of road. He was a newcomer to the Dundrod circuit.\n(Click on thumbnail to enlarge)\nHans BALTISBERGER - 1956 - Brï¿½nn. Hans Baltisberger (born September 16, 1924, Betzingen, Germany - August 26, 1956 ) was a Grand Prix motorcycle road racer from Germany. His best year was in 1954 when he finished the season in fifth place in the 250cc world championship. Baltisberger was killed while riding a 250cc NSU motorcycle at the 1956 Czechoslovakian Grand Prix, a non-championship event at the Masaryk Circuit in Brno.\nFergus ANDERSON - Floreffe Belgium - 1956. \nFergus Kenrick Anderson (February 9, 1909 – May 6, 1956) was a two-time Grand Prix motorcycle road racing World Champion. A Scot, he was one of the first riders from Great Britain to make his living racing motorcycles on the European continent. In 1950 he signed with Moto Guzzi and competed in the 250cc class. He convinced Moto Guzzi to build a 350cc bike, initially of 320cc but later a proper full 350. He raced to the 1953 world championship in the bike's first year of competition. He repeated this feat as 350cc champion again in 1954. His 350cc world championship wins were the first by a non-British bike. He retired from racing to become Moto Guzzi's team manager, but quit over a dispute over having a freer hand at running the team. He returned to racing and was offered a ride by the BMW factory. He was killed in 1956 after being thrown from his bike at a race in Belgium at Floreffe.\nCharlie Salt's light weight Earl's forked 1951 BSA\n(click on images to enlarge)\n \nCharlie SALT - Senior TT, 1957, Isle of Man. The record breaking Senior TT Race and the Golden Jubilee celebrations were marred by the death of Charlie Salt who crashed a BSA motorcycle at Ballagarraghyn Corner and was killed during the later stages of the 1957 Senior TT Race. Charlie Salt raced, test rode for BSA motorcycles, dabbled in engine development, and lost his life at the 1957 Golden Jubilee TT. His brother George T. Salt also raced up till that time, having come 9th in the SeniorTT in 1956 on a Norton. While Charlie showed promise in post war Manx Grand Prix events his results were not as good in the ensuing years. He was born circa 1916, but does not appear in IOM records till after WWII, when he was in his thirties. In 1951 Bert Hopwood demonstrated the Super Flash to the French police at Monthlery. \"The French police wanted a bike that would haul a fully-equipped Gendarme sitting upright at 100mph. The only way the BSA test riders Charlie salt and Bill Nicholson could do this was to chin the tank in the wooded section of Monthlery where they couldn't be seen, get to 100 then sit up just as they emerged from the trees and into view...\" In the 1952 Lightweight TT Charlie rode a Pike-Rudge, as did the builder Roland Pike, Charlie coming 10th and Roland 13th. \"Charles Francis Salt was a 43 year old motor car dealer from Streetly, Staffordshire. An experienced rider, he’d been riding for 25 years and had competed in the TT, Manx and Ulster TT. The senior race of 1957 was run over 8 laps for the first time, and it was on this final lap that Salt crashed. At 2pm, as he raced through Gorse Lea, about a mile before Ballacraine, the engine of his BSA seized. Struggling to contain the wobble, Salt and his machine struck a low stone wall and a concrete post adorned with red reflectors, ripping it from the ground. Salt was thrown 33 feet and landed suspended between a beech tree and the wall, from where the injured rider was recovered by spectators and laid in the field. Dr Bull attended from Ballacraine and found the poor man unconscious and with multiple spine fractures. He did come round sufficiently to ask what had happened. Salt was placed in an ambulance and arrived at Nobles hospital at 3:30pm, but despite the administration of oxygen and blood transfusions, he succumbed to his injuries. His wife and young son were spectating from the grandstand at the time\". Charlie Salt crashed, probably because of a gear-box seizure, during the eighth lap of the 1957 Senior Tourist Trophy. That year the race was eight laps. He died after arrival in hospital, probably in Douglas, of an internal bleeding. Charlie Salt was a regular and popular participant at the Isle Of Man races, he started racing at the Manx Grand Prix in 1946. After three years in which he obtained a third in the 1948 Senior race as best result, he switched to the Tourist Trophy, where he rode Velocette and BSA machines. His achievements also include a second at the 350 cm3 Ulster GP in 1949, a fifth in the 1950 Belgian Grand Prix, again in the 350 cm3 class, both results obtained with a Velocette. He was then second at the 1955 Leinster 200, riding a 350 cm3 BSA.\n \nJosef KNEBEL - Dutch TT Sidecar, 28 June 1957, Assen - Josef was killed during practice for the Dutch TT at Assen.  Josef  crashed at de Bult bend of the Circuit van Drenthe of Assen.

Roger had been in the Schleiz less than a week. But in that time he had created  such an impression that 2000 people attended his funeral. Barker was a member of  Australia’s 1957 Isle of Man TT team. He had been in Continental Circus for less  than a season and contested half a dozen international race meetings. Roger  qualified on pole position for the 350 race. However, race day was blazing hot.  Forty degrees and Roger was never comfortable in serious heat. Moreover, in 1957  sports people didn’t know about dehydration as they do today. Roger led from the  start of the 350 race, setting a new outright lap record before retiring with  tyre trouble. In the 500 race, Roger led once again – chased by Germany’s Ernst  Hiller on a BMW. But midway through the scheduled 20 laps and on the opposite  side of the course from the start/finish, the conditions proved too much. Roger  Barker collapsed, falling from his machine in a straight line. He struck a lone  apple tree at the side of the circuit and sadly was killed instantly. \n \nRoberto COLOMBO - Belgian GP 125 1957, Spa.

Keith Campbell grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Prahran with the ambition to be a champion racing motor cyclist. He became Australia's first motorcycling world champion when he won the 1957 FIM 350cc world championship as a member of the Moto Guzzi factory racing team. He married Geraldine, the sister-in-law of Britain’s championship rider Geoff Duke and came back to Australia on his honeymoon in December 1957. He returned to Europe as the star rider at the 500cc Grand Prix de Cadours near Toulouse in France.

Thomas Edward Phillis (9 April 1934 in Sydney – 6 June 1962) was a Grand Prix motorcycle road racer. In 1961, he won Honda's first championship race when he took the 1961 125cc Spanish Grand Prix. He went on to win the FIM 1961 125cc World Championship. This was also Honda's first world championship. Phillis was married to Betty and they had two children, Debra and Braddan. He died while competing in the 1962 Isle of Man TT. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at the TT race course startline. The defending 500 cc world champion, Gary Hocking, was so affected by the death of his friend that he immediately retired from motorcycle competition.\nBob MCINTYRE - Oulton Park 1962\n He is most famously associated with the Isle of Man TT race, where he was the first to record a 100mph (160 km/hr) lap. Robert MacGregor McIntyre (28 November 1928 Scotstoun, Glasgow - 15 August 1962) was a Scottish motorcycle racer famous for five motorcycle Grand Prix wins which included three wins at the Isle of Man TT Races, and four victories in the North West 200. In 1957, owing to personal intervention by injured Gilera works rider Geoff Duke, McIntyre was offered a ride on the four cylinder Gileras for the Isle of Man TT. Race week began with the Junior TT. He broke the lap record with a 97.42 mph (156.78 km/h) and his race average was 94.99 mph (152.87 km/h). In celebration of the Golden Jubilee, the Senior was run over eight laps, a race of 302 miles (486 km). The Gileras had pannier fuel tanks built into the side of the fairings to carry extra fuel. The extra fuel weight didn't stop him from making a 99.99 mph (160.92 km/h) first lap. The second lap saw 101.03 mph (162.59 km/h), and the fourth lap was the fastest at 101.12 mph (162.74 km/h). He caught up to, and overtook 1956 World Champion, John Surtees who was riding an MV Agusta 500. McIntyre went on to win, after racing for three hours, two minutes and fifty-seven seconds. This was Bob McIntyre's best TT. The 1957 World Championship looked to be within reach, but a crash at Assen, in the Dutch TT meant he was out of action for a couple of months. He did come second in the 500 cc Ulster Grand Prix, and won the 350 cc Nations Grand Prix at Monza. His team mate Libero Liberati won the 500 cc World Championship that year, with Bob McIntyre coming second. Bob was third in the 350 cc World Championship as well.\nAt the end of 1957 the Italian teams quit Grand Prix racing citing increasing costs. In November 1957, with racing over, Gilera had McIntyre ride a 350 cc racer around the banked Monza circuit in an attempt to break the one hour speed record, and he averaged 141 mph (227 km/h) on the bumpy Monza surface. This record was not bettered until 1964, and then by Mike Hailwood at 144.8 on an MV Agusta, on the track at Daytona. In the 1961 Isle of Man TT Lightweight he raised the lap record to 99.58 mph (160.26 km/h), and had a strong lead, when his engine seized, ending his race. Riding a Norton in the Senior TT he came second. He won the 1961 250cc Ulster Grand Prix. In the 1962 Isle of Man Lightweight TT, he raised the lap record to 99.61, and then retired with electrical problems. He also rode in Grand Prix races on Honda and Bianchi, making the podium in Holland, Belgium, and East Germany. In 1962 McIntyre finished second in the Spanish and French Grands Prix, while he had a non-start in the 500 Senior TT and mechanical problems in both the 250 and 350 cc events. He went on to win the Belgium GP at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in the Ardennes, his last victory on the World stage. McIntyre still competed in non-championship events, and it was at one such event at Oulton Park, Cheshire in August 1962 that he won the 250 cc race, and then started in the 500 cc race on his Manx Norton. After a bad start in poor conditions, he fought his way to the front before crashing, and sustaining serious injuries. After nine days in hospital, he died, an outstanding racer, and a great loss to the motorcycling world.\nHarold SCHOLES - fatally injured at Brands Hatch - 19 August 1962 - whilst competing on a  sidecar and died of his injuries 9 days later 28 August 1962 \n(Click on thumbnail to enlarge)\nDave DOWNER - 12 May 1963 - killed in a race at Brands Hatch in a controversial incident involving Derek Minter when Derek lost traction and Dave in avoiding the crash hit a tree and was fatally injured\n \nMarcelin HERRANZ - French GP - 1 June 1963 - Charade.

In a tragic accident the Austrian rider Alois Hofer from Graz, crashed his two-cylinder Puch Type 262 RS in the 1968 Gaisberg hillclimb. The accident itself seemed insinificant but the bike caught fire and the flames engulfed Alois causing him fatal injury. Albin Sterbenz and the very talented mechanic and racing driver Alois Hofer had set out to design a competitive twin-cylinder racing bike in order to later on build a good production model from it, deserves its own chapter in the Puch racing sport history. Unfortunately this chapter is also the saddest one, because it marked not only the end of the company’s engagement in racing, but racing also claimed the life of Alois Hofer, born 1933. The twin-cylinder engine consisted of two conjoined 125M engines. After a lot of work they finally obtained 50 PS in the performance test, a tremendous result at that time. It was mounted in a tubular frame patterned after the Norton Featherbed  frame. For the transmission a 6-gear transmission unit was used since the bike was primarily raced in hillclimbs. Many national races were won in 1968 but this year was also fatal for Alois Hofer. A crash that was relatively harmless cost him his life when his racing leathers caught fire. This caused Puch to withdraw from racing and it was also the end of races on the Gaisberg. A sad tale indeed.\nBill IVY - East German GP 350 1969, Sachsenring. William David Ivy (27 August 1942–12 July 1969) was a British Grand Prix motorcycle road racer from Maidstone, Kent. Ivy started racing motorbikes at Brands Hatch in 1959. He raced in the Grand Prix motorcycle racing championship towards the end of 1965, where he finished fourth in two 125 cc races and third in a 250 cc race. In 1966, he raced for the works Yamaha team, won the first race of the year at the Montjuich Circuit in Spain, and took three more wins—not enough, however, to beat Swiss rider Luigi Taveri, who beat Ivy to the title by six points.\nIn 1967, Ivy dominated the 125 cc championship: he won eight out of twelve races to claim the World Championship by 16 points over Phil Read. On top of this, he won two 250 cc races in France and Belgium.\nIn 1968, Ivy and teammate Phil Read controlled both the 125 and 250 cc championships. In the process Ivy also became the first 125cc rider to lap the famous Isle Of Man TT Mountain Course at over 100 mph. As the season progressed, Yamaha ordered them to win one title each, with Ivy scheduled to win the 250 cc championship and Read the 125 cc championship.[1] After securing the 125 cc title, Read ignored Yamaha's orders to tie with Ivy on points. The tie break was decided on overall race times, and Read took the title. Ivy announced his retirement from motorcycle racing, stating he would race Formula Two cars during the next season. Despite showing some impressive results in Formula Two, he was enticed back to motorcycling by an offer from Jawa in 1969 to race their 350 cc motorcycle. The season started promising, as he took two second places behind Giacomo Agostini. However, during practice for the fifth race, on the Sachsenring in East Germany, Ivy was touring back to the paddock with his helmet resting on the tank when his motorcycle's engine seized. He was thrown from the bike, sustained massive head injuries, and died in hospital.\n(More pics here 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 )\nSven RENLUND: (no pic available) - Ice racing, Sundsval Ornskoldsvik in 1970.

Santiago Herrero (b. May 9, 1943) was a Grand Prix motorcycle road racer. He was born in Madrid, Spain. At the age of 12 Santiago Herrero bought his first motorcycle. In 1962, he obtained his racing license, competing on a Derbi and doing his own maintenance. He soon moved up to a Bultaco Tralla 125 and caught the eye of Luis Bejarano, the owner of Lube (a Spanish motorcycle marque) who recognized Herrero's talent. Bejarano offered him a job in the company's competition department. In 1964, Herrero finished in third place in the 125cc Spanish National Championship and in 1965, he finished in second. Unfortunately, the Lube marque ran into financial difficulties and went out of business. Herrero decided to go into business for himself, running a motorcycle repair shop in Bilbao. He purchased a Bultaco and competed as a privateer. Around this period, Eduardo Girï¿½, lead designer of the Ossa motorcycle company developed a revolutionary bike with a monocoque chassis. Recognizing Herrero's riding talent as well as his mechanical skills, Girï¿½ offered him a job to develop the Ossa 250cc race bike. Together they won the 250cc Spanish National Championship in 1967. In 1968, he would move up to compete in the 250cc Grand Prix world championship. Although the single cylinder Ossa had 20 HP less than the powerful V4 Yamahas of Phil Read and Bill Ivy, the Ossa was 45 pounds lighter and its monocoque frame was much stiffer, giving it superior agility. The Yamahas swept the championship but, Herrero left no doubt that the little Ossa was quick and dependable. He finished seventh in the championship and claimed a third place in the final race of the season at Monza. He would once again take the 250cc Spanish National Championship. 1969 would be a big year for Herrero. He began the year winning his first Grand Prix at the opening race of the season in front of his countrymen at Jarama. After retiring from the German Grand Prix with mechanical problems, he returned with a victory at Le Mans. He followed this with third place at the Isle of Man TT, a considerable accomplishment considering his horsepower deficit on the infamous Snaefell Mountain Course. He triumphed again at Spa and was leading the championship points race when he was beset by bad luck. He crashed in the rain at the Ulster Grand Prix and suffered a broken left arm. Most observers considered his championship hopes dashed, but Herrero showed true grit by coming back to finish in a remarkable fifth place at Imola. At last race of the season in Yugoslavia, he held a one point lead in the championship. He started the race in the lead but crashed on the seventh lap, ending his championship hopes. He would finish third in the World Championship. He repeated as Spanish 250cc champion for a third consecutive year. Herrero got the 1970 season off to a promising start. Although, he retired from the first race of the season in Germany, he finished in second in France and took a victory in Yugoslavia. The Grand Prix circus then moved to the treacherous Isle of Man venue for the 1970 Isle of Man TT. Herrero crashed at the 13th Milestone (Westwood Corner) on 8 June 1970, losing control of his motorcycle on melted tar during the sixth and final lap of the 250cc Lightweight TT. Despite a previous setback at Braddan Bridge when he went up the slip road and crashed, breaking his windscreen, he had battled back up to third place. Stan Woods, who had originally been reported to have collided with Herrero, actually crashed while trying to avoid him. As a result of the accident, Woods suffered a broken ankle and two broken collar-bones. Herrero died of irreversible shock and from his injuries two days later. He was 27 years old. The cause of the accident was described by Stanley Wood as \"may have been melting tar on the bend.\" His loss affected the Ossa factory so much that they abandoned racing altogether. Spain had lost one of their first racing heroes.\nJohn WETHERALL: \n(no pic available) 12 Jun 1970 -\nIsle of Man TT - Senior Race - crashed his Norton near Milntown Cottage on the approach to Ramsey.\nBrian STEENSON - TT 17 June 1970, Isle of Man - (photo supplied by Denis Paineau taken at Le Mans 1970 GP).

Bradley, on a new H1-R Kawasaki, got a great start and was fifth or sixth as the field streamed down the banking for the first time. \"I was drafting Dick Mann in that race,\" Bradley's teammate Frank Camillieri remembers. \"I was three feet behind him and bikes all around me, top gear, at 155mph. I remember seeing someone go sliding as we went into (turn) one, but I didn't know until later that it was Rusty.\" After the incident, Camillieri chose to never race at Daytona again.\nBradley seemed to be trying to make a late-braking move going into turn one. Racer Don Emde was directly behind Bradley when he fell. \"I saw the whole thing. I remember thinking as we crossed the finish line that first time around to take it easy. We all had full gas tanks and there was a lot of traffic. I was behind Kel Carruthers as we went into turn one and I just tried to keep some space between us. That's when Rusty came by me. Basically he just got caught up in traffic as the field compressed going into the turn. Rusty ran right into Kel Carruthers, right at about Kel's seat. Rusty went over the high-side and just started bouncing.\" It happened on the first lap of the race.\nBradley was immediately transported to a local Daytona Beach hospital. It has been said that Bradley was wearing a poorly-made helmet and died of massive head injuries. According to his family, this is untrue. They state that he suffered both aortic and spinal cord damage to his neck in the crash, that there was no blood flow to his brain. The doctors were powerless to help Bradley. Hours after a crash in his first expert race, he was taken off life support.\n  \nBrian FINCH:\n(no pic available) -\n9 June 1971 - IOM TT - Brian was killed during the 500 production race.

During the 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, after winning the first two 125cc races of the season in West Germany and France, Parlotti decided to race at the 1972 Isle of Man TT Races to take advantage of his main championship rival Angel Nieto's absence from the Isle of Man Mountain Course.[1] While lying in first place on the second lap during the 1972 125cc Ultra-Lightweight TT Race held in heavy rain, Gilberto Parlotti crashed his 125cc Morbidelli motorcycle at the Verandah section on the A18 Mountain Road and died from his injuries. The death of Gilberto Parolotti helped bring about the end of the Isle of Man TT Races as a world championship event. After his death, his close friend Giacomo Agostini announced he would never again race at the Isle of Man TT Races because he considered it too unsafe to be a part of the FIM World Motorcycle Championship calendar. At the time, the Isle of Man TT was the most prestigious race on the world championship calendar. Other top riders joined his boycott of the event and by 1976, the event was dropped from the Grand Prix championship schedule. \nHans-Jï¿½rgen CUSNIK - 16 Jul 1972 - Czechoslovakian GP  sidecars (passenger) 1972, Brno.

Renzo Pasolini (18 July 1938 – 20 May 1973), nicknamed \"Paso\", was a popular Italian Grand Prix motorcycle road racer in the 1960s and late 1970s.\nHis unpredictable and unrehearsed racing style made him a crowd favourite. Pasolini's rivalry with Giacomo Agostini divided motorcycling enthusiasts, and while Pasolini's style brought mixed results (ultimately preventing him from winning a world title), it earned him a place in the hearts of many fans. Pasolini was born in Rimini, the son of a motorcyclist. He began his motocross career in 1958, after having shown great interest in boxing as well. A smoker and incorrigible party-goer, he was an uncommon athlete, as was his approach to corners while racing—a dangerous combination of balance and speed which always made him seem about to fall off his bike. After performing well in motocross, Pasolini focussed on road racing while remaining active in other sports to keep physical form. In 1962, he debuted with the Aermacchi 175cc, when his two first-place finishes ahead of Giacomo Agostini spurred their long rivalry. Pasolini took a two-year break from racing to complete his military service and, while stationed in Sardinia, he met his future wife, Anna, with whom he would have two children, Sabrina and Renzo Stefano.\nPasolini resumed his racing career in 1964, racing Aermacchi 250cc and 350cc bikes at the senior level. In the 1965 Italian championship, Pasolini, racing a Benelli, finished second to Tarquinio Provini in the 250cc class and third in the 350cc class behind Giacomo Agostini and Giuseppe Mandorlini. 1966 was a year of varying results both domestically and internationally; most notable was the final race of the Italian championship, which Pasolini won on the then-new four-cylinder Benelli 500.\nWith a more competitive bike, Pasolini was able to rival the best, and this marked the start of a string of epic confrontations with Mike Hailwood, then riding a Honda, and the revival of his rivalry with Agostini, an MV Agusta rider. The 1968 season saw him second to Agostini in the 350cc championship, after having earned the 250cc and 350cc Italian titles.\n1969 brought mixed results, causing Pasolini to lose out to Benelli teammate Kel Carruthers in the 250cc world championship. New regulations in the 250cc classification for the 1970 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season limited the category to two-cylinder bikes, which prompted the Benelli team to concentrate on the 350cc class. After a miserable season, Pasolini left Benelli and joined Aermacchi, fresh out of a merger with Harley-Davidson. Much of the 1971 season was lost to testing the Aermacchi/Harley-Davidson 250cc bike, which took much longer in development than had been anticipated. The resulting bike was not superior to most, and a number of up-and-coming racers increased competition; among them was Jarno Saarinen, to whom Pasolini lost the 250cc world championship in 1972 by a single point. Pasolini lost his life at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza on 20 May 1973. The biker was not able to finish the 350cc race because of mechanical problems, withdrawing from competition with four laps to go, and fell during the first lap of the 250cc race. Jarno Saarinen, immediately behind him, was unable to avoid him and fell as well, causing a chain reaction ultimately involving twelve riders and resulting in Pasolini's and Saarinen's deaths. Much debate has surrounded the probable causes of the accident, with the most common explanation suggesting that a spill left on the track during the 350cc race (when Walter Villa's Benelli leaked on the penultimate lap, but the urge to collect championship points led the rider to continue racing despite the leak) likely caused the bike to slide. While it has been ascertained that race officials did neglect to order clean up of the track prior to the 250cc race—one rider, John Dodds, made his concerns known to authorities, only to be met with threats—Pasolini's fall and the damage sustained by his vehicle are consistent with an engine problem, likely a seizure of the pistons. \nIn 1986, Ducati Motor Holding, then under the ownership of Cagiva, introduced the Ducati Paso, named after Pasolini and designed by Massimo Tamburini, co-founder of Bimota.\n \nJarno SAARINEN  - Italian GP 250 1973, Monza\nIn 1972 he won the World 250cc Championship and came 2nd in the 350cc class.\n In 1973 he won the Daytona 200. Jarno Karl Keimo Saarinen (December 11, 1945 in Turku, Finland – May 20, 1973 in Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Italy) was a Finnish Grand Prix motorcycle road racer. He is the only Finn to win a road racing World Championship. Early in his career Saarinen won the Finnish ice track racing championship. Saarinen was also an accomplished motorcycle speedway racer. He had studied mechanical engineering and thus could modify his bike in addition to riding it. For example, in order for him to ride using his \"hang-off\" style, he lowered the handle bars and angled them downwards at an extreme angle. Saarinen began his Grand Prix career during the 1970 season, at the age of 25. He would finish in a respectable fourth place in the 250cc class, despite missing the last three races to return to his engineering degree studies - before the DNF at the Finnish TT he was tied for second. In 1971 Saarinen competed in both 250cc and 350cc classes. Saarinen won his first Grand Prix that year, claiming the 350cc class in Czechoslovakia. He finished third in 250cc World Championship and second in 350cc. His success didn't go unnoticed as Yamaha signed him to ride its TD3 and TR3 bikes, then pre-production TZs for the 1972 season. Saarinen delivered as expected, winning the 250cc World Championship. He finished second in 350cc World Championship, giving defending champion Giacomo Agostini a strong challenge.\nYamaha developed a new, four cylinder, two-stroke 500cc bike for the 1973 season and chose Saarinen to ride it. Finally, Saarinen was ready to challenge Giacomo Agostini and Phil Read in the 500cc class with competitive equipment. Saarinen's 1973 season started amazingly well, as he became the first European rider to win the prestigious Daytona 200 race in the United States on a TZ350 against much larger-capacity opposition. Returning to Europe, he jumped to an early lead in the Grand Prix championships by winning his first 500cc race, then the premier racing, class. His win was also the first win for the new, four cylinder Yamaha. Saarinen went on to win the first three 250cc rounds and the first two of three 500cc rounds, but his bike suffered a broken chain in the third. It seemed he was on the brink of running away with these titles, with the opportunity to complete in the 350cc class if or when the 250cc title was certain. However, the 1973 season ended in tragedy. On May 20, 1973, the fourth Grand Prix of the season was held at Monza near Milan, Italy. Despite the installation of new chicanes for cars during the previous year's Formula One season (one was placed before the Curva Grande and one at Vialone), they were not used for motorcycle racing at Monza. The second-placed Renzo Pasolini fell in front of Saarinen. He couldn't avoid the fallen rider and the resulting crash caused a multiple rider pile up. In all, 14 riders were embroiled in the mayhem that resulted. When the dust cleared, Jarno and Pasolini lay dead with many other riders seriously injured.\nOver the years, the crash has been subject to significant controversy. The original cause of the crash was attributed to a spill left on the track during the 350cc race when Walter Villa's Benelli began leaking on the penultimate lap. Race officials neglected to clean up the spillage prior to the 250cc race, and one rider, John Dodds, made his concerns known to authorities, only to meet with threats of ejection from the circuit by police. However, some articles have appeared showing photos of Pasolini's bike consistent with the bike having seized.Not only did this incident take the lives of the two top competitors, but after the race, the factory-teams of Suzuki, MV Agusta, Harley Davidson, and Yamaha all joined together to fight for better race conditions. Yamaha went even further by pulling out of racing the rest of the year to honour Saarinen's memory. However, only forty days later, three riders in a Juniors race were killed in the same turn. From that day until 1981, all motorcycle racing at Monza was banned. The tragedy saw the end of a racing regime which had not adjusted to changing times.\nJarno Saarinen's legacy continues to live on. There is still an active Saarinen fan club in Italy. The birth name Jarno became very popular in Italy of many newborn boys in the '70s. One of them is Jarno Trulli, the former Formula-1 driver. Saarinen remains the only Finn to have won a motorcycle road racing world championship, winning 15 Grand Prix during his career. In 2009, the F.I.M. inducted Saarinen into the MotoGP Hall of Fame.\n See tribute here: http://www.ozebook.com/jarno.htm\nEmanuele MAUGLIANI - Skofja Loka Road Race (SLO) 27 May 1973.

Born in the town of Nelson, Newcombe grew up in Auckland, then moved to Australia (first Brisbane, then Melbourne) in 1963, and subsequently moved to Europe in 1968. He competed in the 500cc Grand Prix World Championship finishing second to Phil Read in the 1973 season.\nAlong with fellow racer, John Dodds, he developed a motorcycle using a two-stroke outboard motor designed by Dieter Kï¿½nig. He and the Kï¿½nig were the first to challenge the dominance of the MV Agustas after the departure of Honda from Grand Prix competition at the end of the 1967 season. In contrast to his main competitors, Newcombe was credited with the distinction of developing, building, maintaining, and riding the Kï¿½nig machine in competition.\nOn 11 August 1973, Newcombe was seriously injured at a non-championship event at Silverstone at Stowe Corner. After taking his customary walk of the track prior to the event, Newcombe had requested that hay bales be positioned on the outside of Stowe Corner before the race but race officials refused, stating they were \"not required\". In the race itself, Newcombe slid off the circuit at that very corner, and collided with the concrete barrier. He died from his severe head injuries three days later. He was survived by his wife Janeen who was supporting him on tour, and their son Mark (aged four at the time).\nKim Newcombe's story was the subject of the award winning 2006 documentary Love, Speed and Loss directed by Justin Pemberton.\nSee tribute here: http://www.ozebook.com/konig.htm\nCal RAYBORN - died Pukekohe New Zealand Dec 1973. Calvin Rayborn II (February 20, 1940 – December 29, 1973 (aged 33)) was a top American motorcycle road racer in the 1960s and early 1970s. Born and raised in San Diego, California, Rayborn began riding motorcycles at an early age. He began his racing career in dirt track events in Southern California and in 1964, he began racing professionally in the A.M.A. Grand National Championship, a series which encompassed events in four distinctive dirt track disciplines plus road racing. Rayborn excelled at road racing, winning his first AMA national at Carlsbad, California in 1966. His prowess on road courses earned him a place on the Harley Davidson factory racing team. It was with Harley Davidson that he achieved his greatest success, winning two consecutive Daytona 200 victories in 1968 and 1969.[1] He also set two 1970 motorcycle land speed records. He accomplished a tremendous feat when he competed in the Trans-Atlantic Match Races in England in 1972.[2] The Trans-Atlantic Match Races pitted the best British riders against the top American road racers. On an outdated motorcycle with no experience on British race tracks, Rayborn won three of the six races.\nAt the end of 1973, it was apparent that the Harley Davidson team couldn't provide him with a competitive motorcycle, so Rayborn accepted an offer to race for the Suzuki factory. In late 1973, Rayborn travelled to New Zealand to compete in an auto racing event and to test ride a Suzuki. At the Pukekohe Park Raceway outside of Auckland, Rayborn was killed when he crashed after the bike's engine had seized, and his body slammed into a wall close to the track.\nRayborn was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1999.\nDavid NIXON:  4 June 1974 - Glen Helen IOM Production TT.
