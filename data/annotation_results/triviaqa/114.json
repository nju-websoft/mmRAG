Bye for now.  //Dawn//\nOur Thankgiving feast was just wonderful again this year.  We forgot that our roaster oven cooks the turkey a little faster than a conventional oven, so it was a little overdone and falling off the bone, but delicious none the less. Everybody loved the green bean casserole and sweet potatoes.  We enjoyed the accompanying 2007 Merlot from Markham.  We finished with pumpkin pie (a must!), carrot cake, and an Amaretto cheese cake that Dave and Diane brought with them.  I am so grateful to have my son and daughter here for this unique holiday, and we enjoyed Dave and Diane's visit so much.  You can see Dave making short work of his drumstick in the pic below.  My Stupid Husband dumped his wine over on his plate before dinner even got started and I was so mad at him I could spit.  Luckily my daughter came to the rescue and salvaged the situation.  Bad Belly ate his dinner at the purple end of my white tablecloth.  I hope your Thanksgiving was as good as ours!  It is only 29 days to Christmas! <html><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/104155775149550725059 authkey=Gv1sRgCKfe8Iv377aQhAE\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oAtBDmy1Fg0/TtGECo_slKI/AAAAAAAAAA4/nGFo_NRiTgc/s512/039.JPG\"/  style=\"width: 130px; \"/></a></html>\n''Featured in Menu Magazine Holiday 2007'' MAKES 12 1/2 cups   ACTIVE TIME: 30 min    TOTAL TIME: 50 min   !!Ingredients 2   tsp + 6 Tbsp Wegmans Butter, divided 2   pkgs (8 oz each) Food You Feel Good About Sliced Baby Bella Mushrooms, reserve 1 cup 1   pkg (8 oz) Food You Feel Good About Chopped Onions 3   Food You Feel Good About Peeled Shallots, chopped 2   cloves Food You Feel Good About Peeled Garlic, chopped 2   pkgs (5 oz each) shiitake mushrooms 3.5   oz oyster mushrooms 6   Tbsp flour 2   cartons (32 oz each) Food You Feel Good About Vegetable Culinary Stock: 1   bay leaf 2   sprigs fresh thyme Salt and pepper to taste 1/2   pint (8 oz) Wegmans Heavy Cream Italian Classics Black Truffle Extra-Virgin Olive Oil !!Directions You'll Need: handheld or conventional blender.

Place chicken in a large plastic bag, and pour in the marinade.  Shake well.  Place bag in the refrigerator and allow chicken to marinate for about 3 hours.  By hand, remove chicken from the marinade and place in a colander.  Give the chicken a light rinse in cold water and set aside.  Strain the marinade through a sieve or cheese cloth into a bowl or sauce pan. Discard any solids.  Lay out some paper towels on the counter top.  Place the chicken pieces in a single layer on top of the towels.  Using single sheets of the paper towels, pat the chick thoroughly dry (which promote browning of the chicken.)  Note that when chicken pieces are dry enough, they will tend to stop clinging to the paper towel.  Pick up the chicken and place on a large plate.  Put high heat under the skillet.  Add a tablespoon of the vegetable oil and begin adding the chicken to the pan.  Place in a single layer, starting with the part of the pan most distant from you and working your way toward the front.  The browning will require about three batches.  By the time you finish laying in the chicken, the first meat to go in should ready turn.  Turn the chicken with tongs working your way from back to front.  In the same manner remove the chicken to a large plate.  Repeat until all of the chicken is browned.  Pour ¼ of red wine into the skillet and deglaze, scraping any browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spatula.  Allow the wine to mostly evaporate, about 2 minutes.  Add the strained marinade to the skillet.  When it comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and let simmer for 10 minutes.  Return the chicken to the skillet and raise the heat to medium high.  Let it cook for 10 more minutes, frequently stirring the chicken together with the sauce using a large cooking spoon, until the chicken is cooked through and the dish is hot.

Lay out the string on a cutting board or preparation surface and place the tenderloins side-by-side crosswise.  The string will be used to tie the meat together.  Press the tenderloins tightly against one another.  Drizzle the brandy between the two tenderloins and allow to marinate for ten minutes.  Sprinkle ¾ of the nutmeg on the meat.  Press the sage leaves and sliced garlic onto the sides of the tenderloins and secure by tying the tenderloins together with the string.  Adjust the position of the sage and garlic as need.  Season with salt and pepper.  Turn the tied tenderloins over and slip sage leaves and garlic under the string on the bottom side.  Sprinkle on the remaining nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper.  In a large, deep skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the oil.  Place the tenderloins in the pan and sear on all sides using high heat.  Remove the meat to a plate.  To make the braising liquid, pour out all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan.  Add the vegetables, thyme, and bay leaf, and a pinch of salt and pepper.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned.  Add the wine and simmer for 1 minute.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Return the tenderloins to the skillet and cover.  Cook until the pork is thoroughly done; about 45 minutes to an hour.  Remove the pork from the skillet, place on a cutting board and cover with an aluminum foil tent (do not press foil tightly around meat.)  Allow meat to rest for about 10 minutes.

The sauce is served over vegetables, fish, or Eggs Benedict.    The most important aspect of a successful sauce is to use a double boiler and make sure not to allow the water in the bottom of the double boiler to boil, just remain, hot and lightly simmering.  You can add a tablespoon of cold water if needed to reduce the heat of the water if it starts to boil.  The sauce should be served immediately upon completion.//  Makes: 1 cup !!Ingredients 2 tablespoons white-wine or tarragon vinegar or fresh lemon juice 4 tablespoons boiling water 3 large egg yolks 1/2 cup unsalted butter  1/4 teaspoon cayenne 1/2 teaspoon salt !!Directions Melt the butter and keep it warm.     Heat the vinegar or lemon juice until just warmed.  Have small saucepan with boiling water and a measuring tablespoon ready.    Place the top of a double boiler over (not in) hot water. (This means the bottom of the top of the double boiler should not make contact with the water heating in the bottom half of the double boiler.)  Place the egg yolks in the top of a double boiler and whisk until they begin to thicken.   Now add 1 tablespoon of the boiling water.  Continue to beat the sauce until it begins to thicken. Repeat with the remaining water, one tablespoon at a time, beating the mixture after each addition.  Now add the warmed vinegar or lemon juice. Remove the double boiler from the heat.   Beat the sauce briskly with a wire whisk. Continue to beat the mixture as you slowly pour in the melted butter.  Add the salt and cayenne and beat the sauce until it is thick.

Ingredients 2 lb sweet Italian sausage ½ cup chopped onion for the tomato sauce 2 28 oz cans whole tomatoes, crushed by hand, and any hard stems removed 3 29 oz cans tomato sauce Dried herbs: 4 tbsp each oregano, Italian Seasoning, basil, and 2 bay leaves, for the tomato sauce 4 tbsp granulated (powdered) garlic, stirred into the sauce 2 1 lb boxes lasagna noodles (Barilla, expect to use 1 ½ boxes) 5-6 cups water, lightly salted Cheese mixture: 4 cups Ricotta cheese, strained of excess liquid 4 cups shredded mozzarella 4 eggs 1 cup grated parmesan cheese Extra cheese for topping  !!Directions Make the tomato and sausage sauce.  Put the sausage in a large stew pot over medium high heat, and break down into bite size pieces using a wooden spatula.  Cook the sausage until the fat is fully rendered.  Add the onions and cook until translucent, occasionally stirring with the spatula, about 6-8 minutes.  Add the tomato sauce, and the whole tomatoes.  Crush the tomatoes with your hand as you add them, and discard any hard stem parts and large pieces of peelings.  Stir in the herbs and the granulated garlic.  Allow it to come to a light boil and turn the heat down low to simmer.  Start the water for the pasta (about 5-6 cups water and a big pinch of salt) and begin making the cheese mixture.  Using cheese cloth or a fine strainer (paper towels will work in a pinch), ring any excess liquid out of the Ricotta cheese.  Excess liquid will come out during baking and cause the lasagna to be loose and watery.  Put 4 cups of Ricotta  in the bowl, stir in four eggs, and mix in the 4 cups of shredded mozzarella using a wooden or large rubber spatula.  Reserve a cup or so of the shredded mozzarella to top the lasagna.  Add the parmesan cheese and mix well.  When the pasta water comes to a boil, add as many of the lasagna noodles without overcrowding the pot.  Cook the noodles until they are half-done, about 8-10 minutes.  Then remove the noodles and lay them out carefully in a shallow pan, with cold water, about an inch deep.  This method will stop the noodles from cooking and prevent them from sticking together.  You may have to improvise the pan.  We usually use the bottom basin of an oven broiler pan.  Cook the remaining noodles using the same procedure.  In a casserole dish, assemble the lasagna.  Add sauce to the bottom of the casserole dish first, then apply the bottom layer of noodles, ladle in more sauce, add a layer of the cheese mixture, and cover with noodles.  Use the utility knife to square the edges of the noodles as needed. Repeat the Sauce-Cheese-Noodle layering sequence until you reach the top of the dish.  Spoon on a thin layer of sauce on the final stack of noodles, and top with shredded mozzarella cheese (not the cheese mixture.)  Bake covered for 1-1/2 hours in the oven on 350°.  There are enough ingredients to make two pans, which maximizes the productivity of the effort in making the lasagna.  The uncooked lasagna freezes well.  Allow the baked lasagna to cool about 10 minutes before serving.  Cut the lasagna into rectangles, and serve with garlic bread and a salad.\nA dash or two of extra dry vermouth 1 1/2 oz. vodka Spanish olives Ice !!Directions Place a few ice cubes in a cocktail shaker.

Place a 12-cup standard muffin tin on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the 12 tablespoons butter and 1/3 cup brown sugar. Place 1 rounded tablespoon of the mixture in each of the 12 muffin cups. Distribute the pecans evenly among the 12 muffin cups on top of the butter and sugar mixture.  Lightly flour a wooden board or stone surface. Unfold 1 sheet of puff pastry with the folds going left to right. Brush the whole sheet with the melted butter. Leaving a 1-inch border on the puff pastry, sprinkle each sheet with 1/3 cup of the brown sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of the raisins. Starting with the end nearest you, roll the pastry up snugly like a jelly roll around the filling, finishing the roll with the seam side down. Trim the ends of the roll about 1/2-inch and discard. Slice the roll in 6 equal pieces, each about 1 1/2 inches wide. Place each piece, spiral side up, in 6 of the muffin cups. Repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry to make 12 sticky buns.  Bake for 30 minutes, until the sticky buns are golden to dark brown on top and firm to the touch. Be careful - they're hot! Allow to cool for 5 minutes only, invert the buns onto the parchment paper (ease the filling and pecans out onto the buns with a spoon) and cool completely.\n!!Ingredients 1 gallon brown stock, hot  1 1/2 cups brown roux  1/4 cup bacon fat  2 cups chopped onions  1 cup chopped carrots  1 cup chopped celery  Salt  Freshly ground black pepper  1/2 cup tomato puree  1 [[bouquet garni|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouquet_garni]] !!Directions  In a stock pot, whisk the hot stock into the roux.

Sometimes if we have some leftover refried beans, we'll spread some on the tortillas before topping them with the eggs and salsa. My mother has been known to add a pinch of sugar to the salsa sauce if she feels it's too acidic for her taste.// !!Ingredients Olive oil  1/2 medium onion, chopped (about a half cup)  1 15-ounce can whole tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted, if you can get it (or 1 -2 large fresh vine-ripened tomatoes, when in season)  1/2 6-ounce can diced green Anaheim chiles  Chipotle chili powder, adobo sauce, or ground cumin to taste (optional)  4 corn tortillas  Butter  4 fresh eggs  2 Tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped (optional) !!Directions #Make the sauce first by softening the onions in a little olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat. Once translucent, add the tomatoes and the juice the tomatoes are packed in. Break up the tomatoes with your fingers as you put them in the pan. If you are using fresh tomatoes, chop them first, then add. Note that fresh tomatoes will take longer to cook as canned tomatoes are already cooked to begin with. Add chopped green chilies. Add additional chili to taste, either chipotle chili powder, adobo sauce, regular chili powder, or even ground cumin. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and let simmer while you do the rest of the cooking, stirring occasionally. Reduce to warm after it has been simmering for 10 minutes. Add salt to taste if needed. #Prepare the tortillas. Heat the oven to a warm 150°F, place serving plates in the oven to keep warm. Heat a teaspoon of olive oil in a large non-stick skillet on medium high, coating the pan with the oil. One by one (or more if your pan is big enough) heat the tortillas in the pan, a minute or two on each side, until they are heated through, softened, and pockets of air bubble up inside of them. Then remove them and stack them on one of the warming plates in the oven to keep warm while you continue cooking the rest of the tortillas and the eggs. #Fry the eggs. Using the same skillet as was used for the tortillas, add a little butter to the pan, about two teaspoons for 4 eggs. Heat the pan on medium high heat. Crack 4 eggs into the skillet and cook for 3 to 4 minutes for runny yolks, more for firmer eggs.   To serve, spoon a little of the sauce onto a warmed plate. Top with a tortilla, then a fried egg. Top with more sauce, sprinkle with cilantro if desired.   Serve either one or two eggs/tortillas per plate, depending on how much you want to eat. I'm a 2-egg 2 tortilla person myself.  Makes 2-4 servings, depending on your appetite.  ''Simply Recipes http://simplyrecipes.com''\nServes 1 Cost:  Dirt cheap, maybe $2 to make a plate  !!Equipment Needed Large skillet, spatula, wooden spoon, can opener, butter knife  !!Ingredients 1 flour tortilla 4-5 oz canned refried beans 1-2 tbsp butter 2-3 spoonsful of salsa About 2 oz sharp cheddar cheese ½ jalapeno pepper, diced (optional)  !!Directions Preheat the skillet on medium high heat.  Butter both sides of the tortilla and place in the pan.  Open the can of beans and put portion to one side of the tortilla and to allow them to warm up.  Use a wooden spoon to stir the beans so as to not make your spatula gummy.  When the tortilla is toasted on the bottom, flip it over and toast the other side.  Remove the tortilla and set it aside for the moment.  Turn the heat down to low, and adding a little more butter if needed, break two eggs into the skillet and cook them according to your preference.  Sunny side up does nicely, but there are no hard and fast rules.  Cook them the way you like them.  Spread the beans over one side of the tortilla and place face up in the skillet.  Put the cooked eggs on top of the beans and sprinkle on the cheese.  Let the cheese start to melt and preheat the salsa in one side of the pan (and sauté the diced peppers if you are using them.)

To check the oil temperature, drop a bread cube into it. If the cube browns within 30 seconds the oil is hot enough.  Trim leek, slice in half lengthwise, and wash well under running water. Cut the root end off the leek and then cut each half lengthwise into long, thin strips.  Season flour with salt and pepper. Dredge leek strips in flour. Fry leeks for 1 to 2 minutes, or until crisp and golden.

[[Contact Us]]\n!!Opening Twiddlers Recipes or other twidders are usually opened for viewing by: #Clicking on a link to it #Typing search terms in the search box (which may open several matching twiddlers) #Selecting from among the choices on the Timeline tab (on the right-hand side of the page)  Opening a twiddler will usually result in that twiddler being added to the page, along with other twiddlers you already have open.  The exception is getting to twiddlers using the search box:  a search will display only twiddlers matching your search terms and any previous tiddlers you were viewing will close.  !!Closing Twiddlers Just click on the \"close\" selection at the upper right of the twiddler.  The selection \"close others\" will close all of the tiddlers except the one your working with. You can also close all open tiddlers (which will leave you with a clean page) by clicking on \"close all\", located just below the search box.  !!Printing Recipes You can print a recipe simply by having the recipe twiddler open on the page and printing using the drop-down menu on the browser (e.g., Internet Explorer).  However, that procedure will print all of the open tiddlers being displayed on the page.  If you don't want that, open the recipe tiddler you want and click the \"close others\" selection in the upper right of the tiddler you want before you print.  That way you'll just get your recipe, along with some header and footer information on the printed page.  Wikipe is already set-up to ignore other material on the page such as the Main Menu, search box, etc. when printing.\nEach recipe or other entry in Dawn's Wikipe is called a \"tiddler\". This entry on [[Organization]] is itself a tiddler.  Tiddlers can refer to other tiddlers through links, like the one you probably clicked on to get this one. In normal viewing mode, an internal link shows up in bold color like this: [[Link]].  If you look at this tiddler in edit mode (//edit is one of the grey letter selections located on the upper right of the twiddler area - to return to normal viewing, just click \"done\" or \"cancel\"//), you will see how an internal link is created by using double brackets like this:  [ [ Internal Link ] ]  In Wikipe, that internal link will usually be the title of one of Dawn's recipes.  Recipes become organized by creating tiddlers that list Dawn's recipes in categories, such as [[Soup]] or [[Party Favorites]].  (Did you click on one of these? Wasn't that cool?! If you keep clicking on tiddlers, the page will start filling up with them.  To learn how to manage that, see [[Opening, Closing and Printing Recipes]].)  If you click on [[Salad]] on the main menu on the left, you will find links to the twiddlers [[Pasta Salad]] and [[Deconstructed Pan Grilled Caesar]].  That's all the twiddler [[Salad]] is: a list of other twiddlers using the double bracket link formatting that you can see by looking at [[Salad]] in edit mode.    So the recipe organization is built up by inter-relating recipe or category tiddlers with internal links.  The neat thing is that you can link twiddlers in multiple categories.  For example, both of the recipe categories [[Grill]] and [[Salad]] on the main menu list the recipe twiddler [[Deconstructed Pan Grilled Caesar]].   So it is easy to cross-reference recipes by any number of different principles:  nationality, cooking method, meat, poultry, etc.  There's no limit to this, since you can create any twiddlers you like and link them together any way you like. Once a recipe twiddler has been created, you can add it using an internal link to any other twiddler you want to, and there's no need to retype it:  you can add it to any category, or even refer to it inside other recipes.  For that matter, you can delete it from a category just by removing the internal link.  What a breeze it is to organize and re-organize any way that strikes your fancy!  You can arrange recipes in deeper hierarchies as well.  The examples I've given so far involve category twiddlers pointing directly to recipe twiddlers.  But if you click on [[Main Courses]], for example, you will find a listing of various category twiddlers such as [[Chicken]] and [[Beef]].  Clicking on those links will take you to a list of the actual recipes utilizing those ingredients.  Dawn's Wikipe also includes some external links.  To find out more about that, see [[External Links and Renaming Links]].  To find out how to modify the main menu on the left (yes! you can do that too!) see [[Editing Main Menu]].\n''Recipe from Top Secret Restaurant Recipes by Todd Wilbur'' ''Cookbook Heaven at Recipelink.com''  !!Ingredients ''Dipping Sauce''  1/2 cup mayonnaise  2 teaspoons ketchup  2 tablespoons cream-style horseradish  1/4 teaspoon paprika  1/4 teaspoon salt  1/8 teaspoon dried oregano  Dash ground black pepper  Dash cayenne pepper  ''The Onion''  1 egg  1 cup milk  1 cup all-purpose flour  1 1/2 teaspoons salt  1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper  1/2 teaspoon ground black  1/4 teaspoon dried oregano  1/8 teaspoon dried thyme  1/8 teaspoon cumin  1 giant Spanish onion (3/4 pound or more)  Vegetable oil for frying pepper !!Directions  Prepare the dipping sauce by combining all of the ingredients in a small bowl. Keep the sauce covered in your refrigerator until needed.   Beat the egg and combine it with the milk in a medium bowl big enough to hold the onion.   In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, peppers, oregano, thyme, and cumin.   Now it's time to slice the onion-this is the trickiest step. First slice 3/4 inch to 1 inch off the top and bottom of the onion. Remove the papery skin. Use a thin knife to cut a 1-inch diameter core out of the middle of the onion. Now use a very sharp, large knife to slice the onion several times down the center to create the \"petals\" of the completed onion. First slice through the center of the onion to about three-fourths of the way down. Turn the onion 90 degrees and slice it again in an \"x\" across the first slice. Keep slicing the sections in half, very carefully, until you've cut the onion 16 times. Do not cut down to the bottom. The last 8 slices are a little hairy, just use a steady hand and don't worry if your onion doesn't look like a perfect flower. It'll still taste good.   Spread the \"petals\" of the onion apart. The onion sections tend to stick together, so you'll want to separate them to make coating easier.   Dip the onion in the milk mixture, and then coat it liberally with the dry ingredients. Again separate the \"petals\" and sprinkle the dry coating between them. Once you're sure the onion is well-coated, dip it back into the wet mixture and into the dry coating again. This double dipping makes sure you have a well- coated onion because some of the coating tends to wash off when you fry. Let the onion rest in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes while you get the oil ready.   Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees. Make sure you use enough oil to completely cover the onion when it fries.   Fry the onion right side up in the oil for 10 minutes or until it turns brown.   When the onion has browned, remove it from the oil and let it drain on a rack or paper towels.   Open the onion wider from the center so that you can put a small dish of the dipping sauce in the center. You may also use plain ketchup.\n!!Ingredients 2 lb beef tenderloin 1 tbsp. vegetable oil Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper Mashed potatoes and green vegetable for accompaniment !!Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Heat vegetable oil in cast iron skillet (with lid) over high heat on stove top until very hot.  Generously season tenderloin with salt and pepper and sear tenderloin in hot skillet on all sides until nicely browned.  Cover tenderloin in skillet and roast in oven for 20-30 minutes (rare-to-medium rare.)  Take out of oven and let meat rest for about 10-15 minutes, then cut into thin slices for serving.  Serve with mashed potatoes and a green vegetable.\nPANSIT BIHON GUISADO    PRINT Author: My Style Recipe by Malou Cuisine: Filipino  INGREDIENTS  1 pack pansit bihon(approx. 500 grams) ½ lb chicken breast cooked, deboned and shredded ½ lb pork, sliced thinly 6 cups chicken broth 1 cup green beans sliced thinly and diagonally 1 carrot julienned(cut into long thin strips) ¼ head cabbage sliced 1 cup celery chopped 3 cloves garlic minced 1 onion sliced 2 tbsp. vegetable oil 2 tbsp. fish sauce ¼ cup soy sauce ground pepper to taste 30 ml calamansi juice  INSTRUCTIONS  In a wok, heat oil and sauté garlic and onion then stir fry the sliced pork and cook till tender. Add the cooked chicken and mix well. Then, add the fish sauce. Then, add the green beans, carrot, celery and cabbage and stir fry for a minute or two. Do not overcook! Remove from wok and set aside. In the same wok, boil the chicken broth. Add 1 tbsp. oil, calamansi juice, soy sauce and ⅓ tsp ground pepper. Add the rice noodles, cook till the broth is absorbed by the noodles. Put more than half of the previously cooked meat and vegetables to the rice noodles and simmer for 1-2 minutes. Turn off heat. Transfer to a serving plate.

Unpackage the chicken, remove the packaged innards from the cavity, and pat the bird dry.  Set on clean countertop.  Place the softened butter in a small prep bowl.  Add the chopped rosemary, thyme, lemon zest, and mix thoroughly.  Run a finger under the skin of the chicken breast to loosen.  With the help from a kitchen fork, distribute the butter and herb mixture underneath the skin of the chicken breast.  Rub any remaining butter over the top of the breasts.  Stuff the cavity with 2 springs each of the rosemary and thyme, 1 quartered onion, lemon quarters, and the smashed garlic cloves.  (A quartered orange is also a nice addition, if you happen to have one.)  Pin the wings between the thighs and breasts and tightly truss the drumsticks together with the string.  Generously rub the Northwoods seasoning over the entire surface of the chicken.  Place the chicken on the rack of the roasting pan and cover the bottom of the pan with about a ¼” of the chicken stock.  Place on a lower rack in the oven and roast for about 2 until done.  An easy way to tell if the roaster is done is to separate the leg from the breast and peer down toward the thigh.  The meat should look white and firm.  //Note:  If you do not have Penzeys Northwoods on hand, you can make your own approximation as follows:  Place 1 tablespoon of kosher salt in a prep bowl.  Add 2 teaspoons each of paprika, ground black pepper, dried thyme, dried rosemary, powered garlic or garlic salt, and chili powder.  Combine ingredients and use just as you would the Northwoods.  Save any leftover seasoning for a future recipe.//  When the chicken is in the oven, place a stockpot with the water on the stove on high heat.  Drop in the neck and gizzards, and add the carrots, celery, 2 sprigs each of rosemary and thyme, and a medium onion, skinned and cut in half.  Add a big pinch of salt, bring to a boil and then turn heat to low to simmer while the chicken is roasting. When the chicken is nearly done, remove the stock from the heat and strain the broth into a bowl or saucepan and discard the solids.  Set aside for making the gravy.  Check the chicken to confirm it is thoroughly cooked.  A meat thermometer inserted deeply into the thigh area under the breast should read about 165°.  Remove the roasting pan from the oven and place the chicken on a cutting board.  Cover it with an aluminum foil “tent” and allow it to rest.  Do not seal the chicken in the foil. To make the gravy, place the roasting with the drippings on the stovetop and turn the burners underneath to medium high.  Add the chopped sage leaves and allow to brown for about 2 minutes.  Gradually add the sifted flour, thoroughly mixing with the drippings using a wooden spatula.  Continue adding flour until the drippings are fully absorbed.  You should end up with a loose paste in the pan.  Now start ladling in the broth from the strained stock.  Mix it into the gravy vigorously using the wooden spatula or a balloon whisk.  Continue ladling the broth until the gravy has a thick, but pourable consistency.  Season with fresh ground pepper. Carve the chicken and place on a platter.  Serve with the gravy, mashed potatoes, and a seasonal vegetable or salad.\n''Recipe courtesy Walter Staib, [[City Tavern|http://citytavern.com/events.php?mo=5&yr=2008]]'' ''Nationality: German'' !!Ingredients 2 T Unsalted butter 1 medium Shallot, peeled and chopped I clove Garlic, peeled and chopped 2 1/2 to 3 lbs.

Make the rub: Place the salt, sugar, pepper, and paprika in a bowl and stir to mix. (Actually, your fingers work better for mixing a rub than a spoon or whisk.) Store the rub in an airtight jar away from heat or light; it will keep for at least 6 months.   2. Make the glaze: Combine the butter, brown sugar, mustard, and whiskey in a saucepan and boil until syrupy, 4 to 6 minutes. Set the glaze aside.   3. Using a very sharp knife, cut the roast almost in half lengthwise through one side (stop about 1 inch from the opposite side). Open the roast up as you would a book. Sprinkle the inside of the roast with 1 tablespoon of the whiskey and let it marinate for 5 minutes. Sprinkle a third of the rub over the inside of the roast. Spread the mustard on top with a spatula, then sprinkle the brown sugar on top of the mustard. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of whiskey on top of the brown sugar. Fold the roast back together (like closing a book) and sprinkle the remaining rub over the outside.   4. Cut four 12-inch pieces of butcher's string. Position the pieces of string on the work surface so that they are parallel and roughly 2 inches apart. Place a slice of bacon across the strings so that it is perpendicular to and in the center of them. Set the roast on top of the bacon, positioning its long side parallel to the bacon. Place a slice of bacon on top of the roast. Press the remaining 2 slices against the long sides of the roast. Tie each piece of string together around the roast so that they hold the slices of bacon against it. (To temporarily hold the bacon slices in place until you can secure them with string, you can pin them with toothpicks. Remove the toothpicks once the roast is tied.) Set the pork roast aside.   5. Set up the grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium. If using a gas grill, place all of the wood chips or chunks in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch, and run the grill on high until you see smoke; then reduce the heat to medium. If using a charcoal grill, place a large drip pan in the center, preheat the grill to medium, then toss all of the wood chips or chunks on the coals.   6. When ready to cook, place the pork roast on the hot grate, over the drip pan and away from the heat, and cover the grill. Cook the roast until cooked through, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. To test for doneness, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the center of the roast: The internal temperature should be about 160 degrees F. Start basting the roast with the glaze after 30 minutes, and continue basting every 15 minutes. If you are using a charcoal grill and the pork is not done after 1 hour, you'll need to add 12 fresh coals to each side.   7. Transfer the cooked roast to a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes, then remove and discard the strings. Slice the roast crosswise and drizzle any remaining glaze over it. Serve Nashville Sweet Barbecue Sauce on the side.   //© 2006 Steven Raichlen | site design Benjamin Wilchfort//\n//Recipe thanks to Rebecca Bright// !!Ingredients 1 cup soy sauce 1 cup water 1/3 cup vegetable oil 8 ounce can of pineapple juice 1/8 tablespoon ground ginger 4 or 5 crushed garlic cloves 1/2 cup brown sugar 3 pounds trimmed chicken wings !!Directions Combine ingredients in large container with chicken wings.

It was created using personal wiki markup software called [[TiddlyWiki|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/]].  Here you'll find all the tasty stuff Dawn can make to stuff your hungry pieholes with!  Using Dawn's Wikipe is easy.  To find a recipe, navigate through the categories on the main menu (pun intended!) to the left, or use the search box positioned in the upper right hand portion of the web page (Alt+F is a nifty keyboard shortcut to take you there fast.)  You can save your own local copy of Wikipe and customize it to your heart's content. To add a recipe, click on \"new tiddler\", which you will see in the upper right below the search box.  Give your recipe (in [[TiddlyWiki|http://www.tiddlywiki.com/]] speak, that's a \"tiddler\") a name in the box just below the heading that says New Tiddler.  In the bigger belox below that, you can type in your recipe (or just cut and paste if you're stealing off the internet.)  When you complete the entry, click \"done\", which is a grey link at the top right of the tiddler.  It's that easy!  Before you exit Wikipe, don't forget to \"save changes\" (found in the upper right menu below the search box.) In Internet Explorer, you might get a warning box about ~ActiveX: just click \"Yes\" to complete the Wikipe file saving process.
