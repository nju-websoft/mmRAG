OPINION: Can Elephants Survive a Continued Ivory Trade Ban? OPINION: Can Elephants Survive a Continued Ivory Trade Ban? – National Geographic Society (blogs)\nMore »\nBy Daniel Stiles\nPART ONE: Here I respond to Christina Russo ’s in-depth examination, published in National Geographic News, of one of the more incendiary questions discussed in wildlife conservation circles: Should there be a legal trade in elephant ivory? I discuss some inaccuracies and misconceptions commonly held by ivory trade ban proponents that were quoted in Russo’s article. Following (PART TWO), I lay out for the first time elements that would be included in a legal trade. The outcome, I believe, will be a significant reduction of elephant killing for ivory.  \nI live much of the time in a grass-thatched cottage on a wildlife conservancy in Kenya. I have a view of Mount Kenya out front and the Abedares in back. Just off my large compound is a clearing in the bush that used to be a water reservoir, before the earth dam broke. Now dry, except for a small stream that runs through it, the grass, water, and minerals in the patches of bare soil attract almost daily visits from elephants, white and black rhinos, and all manner of other wildlife.\nWhen I watch the elephant families frolic in the clearing, and see their tusks, I find it hard to imagine that anyone could be so cold-blooded as to kill these magnificent creatures for what are simply long teeth. The elephants use them to good effect as they dig out a wallow in the deeply incised stream.\n \nPhotograph by Daniel Stiles.\nTusks are useful to elephants—they’re not adornment—used among other things to dig out a wallow in a stream bed. Photograph by Daniel Stiles.\n \nI care a lot about elephants. It makes me extremely angry that people kill them for their ivory. But it also frustrates me when I see apparently well-meaning campaigns aimed at policies and actions that will only increase elephant poaching for ivory.\nI am convinced that attempts to completely restrict all ivory sales, both domestic and international, and the campaign to destroy all ivory stockpiles—even the historical collection kept by the British royal family—are backfiring tragically on elephants. Already these restrictions have resulted in skyrocketing ivory prices, which along with other factors has spurred an elephant-killing spree. Sadly, as long as these factors remain in place, this will continue.\nWhat Does Empirical Evidence Say?\nI believe in empirical evidence to test policies and actions. The policy to test since 1990 is the ban on the international trade in ivory.\nElephant poaching did decrease in some places after the ban, but it carried on as usual in others, and in parts of Southeast Asia it actually increased, with Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar losing two-thirds of their elephant populations in the decade after the ban.  \nIn the early years after the ban, ivory market activity and raw ivory prices dropped almost everywhere data are available. It appeared that the ban was initially successful in reducing illegal ivory trading. I thought myself that this was the case until I analyzed what had actually occurred leading up to and following the 1990 ban implementation.\nHong Kong and Japan in the 1980s were the biggest importers and manufacturers of raw ivory. They were probably also the biggest buyers of poached tusks. As calls for more controls on ivory trade escalated in the 1980s, and CITES imposed a quota system on raw ivory exports, elephant poaching increased. With increased poaching, calls began for a total ban on ivory trade from Africa, which could be achieved by listing the African elephant on CITES Appendix I.\nNo one, to my knowledge, has ever truly determined the drivers of the increased poaching. Not enough research was conducted on ivory markets in the 1980s to be certain, but reports of huge raw ivory stockpiles in Hong Kong in 1989 (665 tons) and Japan (unquantified, but in the 1980s more than 2,500 tons were imported) lead to one conclusion: They were stockpiling. Why? Because a future supply of ivory was uncertain, and increasingly it looked like a ban was on the way.\nIf high consumer demand had been the cause of the increased poaching, the stockpiles would not have existed. The raw ivory would have been processed.\nTragically, the rising calls for an ivory trade ban increased poaching because East Asian dealers and factories decided to stockpile for future use. The two fed each other in a positive feedback loop—increased poaching, increased calls for control, leading to more poaching to stockpile, ad infinitum until the ban.\nAfter the CITES ban, demand fell in the West owing to all the negative publicity related to buying ivory that accompanied the run-up to the ban. East Asia’s largest ivory export market withered. East Asia was left with huge ivory stockpiles and falling demand. Prices fell, ivory market activity slumped. The ban seemed to be working.\nLack of Foresight\nThe period 1990-92 was critical for planning for future predictable occurrences. One: As the stockpiles dwindled, East Asian ivory factories would eventually begin looking for new raw ivory. Two: By 1990, the economic reforms made by China’s “paramount leader” Deng Xiaoping were well apparent. China would become an important part of the ivory demand equation. Three: With the trade ban in place, the ivory could only be obtained from poaching.\n \nBy 1990 it was apparent that China would become an important part of the ivory demand equation because of economic growth and liberalization. The vertical red line indicates the start of the ivory trade ban. (Graph courtesy of Wikipedia).\n \nIf conservationists had been proactive, they would have planned for these three predictable occurrences, but they did not. Esmond Martin and I carried out a series of ivory investigations in Africa and Asia between 1999 and 2003. We noted , “… in parts of Central and West Africa there appears to have been a slow revival since the mid-1990s.” In South East Asia we found , in part, “Unfortunately, it appears that demand for ivory has remained steady or increased in some places in Asia since the mid-1990s, stimulating elephant poaching.” \nHowever, after the CITES-authorized 1999 sales from southern Africa to Japan, the ivory market decline continued in China, Taiwan, and Japan. All the indicators—ivory prices, numbers of factories, craftsmen, outlets, etc.—had dropped from pre-1989 levels.\n“These statistics illustrate very well indeed that the ivory industry of Japan since the late 1980s has experienced a massive decline,” and “probably the most surprising finding of this survey was the unexpectedly small size of the local market in China,” said Martin and Stiles in 2003: The Ivory Markets of East Asia report.\nIn spite of hard evidence to the contrary, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) continues to claim that the 1999 sale stimulated demand and “substantially compromised its [the ban’s] integrity, effectiveness, and enforceability,” according to Allan Thornton in Russo’s essay .\nEsmond Martin and I could find no signs of this.  We wrote: “Ivory industry business personnel in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan did not believe that the 1999 southern African ivory auctions had a significant effect on either internal or external ivory demand.”\n \nIn 2002 half-empty shelves showed that the ivory industry was moribund in China, but there was still ivory being manufactured 12 years after the ban from newly poached tusks. The 1999 CITES-approved sale to Japan had changed nothing. Photograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nIf CITES Parties and conservationists had seized the opportunity to establish a well-designed legal raw ivory trade regime in the early 1990s when demand was low, the poaching rise we have witnessed over the past 20 years could have been avoided.\nThe Real Cause of Rising Demand in China\nThe credo of the ivory ban proponents has been that the 2008 CITES-approved ivory sale to Japan and China was the cause of the spike in consumer demand, which set off the current elephant poaching crisis. The insinuation was that a regular legal ivory trade would be even more disastrous.\nEsmond Martin and Lucy Vigne assessed Japan’s ivory market in late 2009 and concluded that “The golden days of ivory carving in Japan have ended.” The market had continued its precipitous downward spiral seen in 2002. There were fewer carvers, outlets, and items seen for sale.\nThese findings did not prevent EIA’s Allan Thornton proclaiming falsely in Russo’s article that “Japan is back in the ivory business,” implying it had been reinvigorated because of the 2008 sales.\nHowever, consumer demand for ivory did rise in China, beginning in about 2004 and surging in 2006. It took a Chinese student researcher from Yale University to discover what prompted the rise in ivory interest in China. Yufang Gao spent two days visiting with me in Kenya and explaining his ideas , which I found original and stimulating.\nGao was not satisfied with the common explanation that the rise in ivory demand was driven by the CITES approved one-off sale in 2008. He learned that in 2002 the Chinese government started to put traditional culture preservation on the agenda, and in 2005 the government launched a number of initiatives in association with UNESCO’s Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.\nIn 2006 ivory carving was designated as a national intangible cultural heritage. This State recognition enhanced the cultural value of ivory carving, raising its value in the eyes of consumers.\nFrom 2002 to 2006 the Chinese government promoted ivory carving as an intangible cultural heritage, which raised its value and desirability in the eyes of the public.\nPhotograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nThe second and the most important driver of worked ivory demand was a boom in arts investment, especially after the global economic crisis that began in 2007. As real estate and stock markets tumbled, a large amount of capital from individuals and professional investment companies started to enter the art market. Along with ancient Chinese paintings, jades, and porcelains, carved ivory was touted as a profitable investment. Media coverage about the astronomical prices of auctioned ivory greatly boosted the perceived economic value of ivory products, new or old, which led to an explosion of ivory demand.\nIvory art for investment took off in 2009 and peaked at the end of 2011, mirroring elephant poaching data produced by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) program.\n \nBetween 2009 and 2011 wealthy Chinese consumers flocked to buy ivory artworks as an investment, stimulating demand. Photograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nIt was these cultural and investment factors, and not the 2008 one-off ivory sale, which stimulated consumer interest in worked ivory in China.\n“The 2008 CITES one-off sale stimulating demand in China is a myth created by Westerners,” Gao told me.\nConsumer Demand Falls—Elephant Poaching Rates Go Up?\nRecent information suggests that consumer demand has been falling since 2012, supported by research carried out in China by Kirsten Conrad and Brendan Moyle in 2013 and 2014 . “The factories are actually using up tusks slower than the total allocations (13.78 tons out of 18). If demand had taken off in the way many are claiming, then we’d expect to see these numbers trending up to match,” said Brendan Moyle . Some factories were even selling raw ivory because they didn’t need it.\nIf the investment craze for carved ivory was tapering off, why was elephant poaching still going full speed ahead?\n \nIvory factories in China did not even use all of the tusks they were allocated by the government. Moyle found that the 2012-13 weight of raw ivory processed fell by more than 50 percent from 2011-12 (the production cycle is July-July), indicating a drop in consumer demand. Photograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nIt was not only Chinese consumer interest in carved ivory that sparked the poaching crisis beginning in 2008-09. Investors, a.k.a. speculators, also became interested in raw ivory—tusks. After anti-trade NGOs succeeded in forcing a nine-year moratorium on proposals for future legal ivory sales from southern Africa at the CITES Conference of the Parties in 2007, unscrupulous ivory dealers saw that there was even more money to be made from poached tusks, because uncertainty of supply fuels speculation.\nCITES, thanks to anti-trade NGOs, had provided traffickers with a windfall. Just as China ivory factories thought that they would be receiving a continued supply of legal tusks through repeated CITES-approved sales, their hopes were dashed . \nWe are now back to a situation somewhat like the 1980s, where East Asian dealers and factories are buying all of the poached ivory they can. The positive feedback loop, with calls for more restrictions leading to more stockpiling and more poaching are once again feeding one another. But instead of Hong Kong and Japan, now it’s China that is buying most of the poached ivory. And instead of stockpiling ivory for future use, some of the biggest buyers are hoarding tusks for future sale, when they expect to make a killing as increasing tusk scarcity continues to force prices ever higher.\nThe “ Stop Ivory ” campaign, which aims to close all ivory markets and destroy all stockpiles, is creating a perception of ivory scarcity. The well-publicized new round of ivory stockpile destructions beginning in Kenya in 2011 and running up to the present in the Philippines, the USA, China, Hong Kong, and other places has turned perception into reality. Close to 70 tons of ivory has been destroyed, equaling the legal annual quota in China over 12 years.\nThe Price of Illegal Raw Ivory in China Has Skyrocketed\nMartin and Vigne went to China in late 2010, and again in May 2014, and found that “The average price paid by craftsmen or factory owners, for good quality, privately-owned 1-4 kg elephant tusks in Beijing in early 2014 was $2,100 per kilogram [$955 per pound]. The average price for similar tusks in 2010 was $750 per kg [$341 per pound].”\nSpeculators are attracted to a 280 percent return on investment in less than four years. If the ivory is purchased in Africa, profits are much higher. Chinese ivory traffickers are flocking to the Zambian countryside, Dar es-Salaam, Kinshasa, and dozens of other places in Africa where tusks can be bought from poachers and middlemen for as little as $50 per kilogram. What speculator can resist buying a commodity at $50 a kilogram and selling it for $2,100 a kilogram? That’s a 4,200 percent profit! In reality, of course, with all of the expenses and an average buying price of about $150 a kilogram, profit might be “only” 1,000 percent.\nThe opportunity for enormous profits has prompted high-level African politicians, military officers, and police commanders to muscle into the trafficking networks. Corruption of the kind described by Liz Bennett in her recent essay in Conservation Biology is now common. The corruption is a result of the CITES ivory trade ban and is strengthened by the campaign to “Stop Ivory.”\nWe need to appreciate that the high poaching rates and corrupt ivory trafficking networks described by Bennett were created under an ivory ban regime. The two one-off sales were blips that had little effect, as both the Elephant Trade Information (ETIS)  and MIKE concluded after extensive analysis. I concluded the same when analyzing the 1999 one-off sale.\nEven with the downturn in consumer demand for carved ivory in China, the increased speculator demand for raw ivory is driving horrifying rates of elephant poaching.\nTom Milliken, who manages ETIS, was recently quoted as saying , “Just looking at large-scale ivory seizures, 2013 represents the highest quantity of ivory seized in 25 years of data going back to 1989.” More than 51 metric tons (57 U.S. tons) of ivory were seized in 2013! This is empirical evidence that the CITES ivory ban and stockpile destruction are bad policy.\n \nThe high price of ivory is driving elephant massacres all across Africa. Speculators encourage this because greater scarcity of elephants and ivory means higher prices in future.\n \nWhat Is the Solution?\nEmpirical evidence does not suggest that more of the same would be successful in reducing poaching. I agree with Albert Einstein, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”\nIf China could receive 40-50 tons and Japan 10-15 tons of legal raw ivory annually, the speculators would be put out of business, most ivory factory owners would cease buying poached tusks, raw ivory prices would plummet, and elephant poaching would become much less profitable, greatly reducing the incentive to poach. Uncertainty and speculation would cease.\nThis quantity of ivory could be supplied from a combination of existing African stockpiles, natural elephant mortality and “problem” animal control. Many people are unaware that large numbers of elephants are killed legally every year in human-elephant conflict situations. Not a single elephant life would have to be sacrificed for this legal, regulated trade.\nElephant killing would not cease entirely, because there are other drivers such as human-elephant conflict, meat, and African ivory markets. But even a 50 percent reduction in poaching rates would be worth it.\nIs the goal to stop elephant killing, or stop ivory? I’m for the first one.\nPART TWO: How would a legal trade system work?\nWith a legal raw ivory trade, elephants can thrive.\nThere are measures that can be taken to avoid corruption and laundering of the type described in Elizabeth Bennett’s Conservation Biology essay. She described the problems associated with the current illegal system and applied them to an assumed legal ivory trade. Her assumptions were faulty.\nThe legal system would need to achieve three essential outcomes: (1) ivory factory owners no longer buy poached tusks, (2) ivory consumer demand is driven down to meet available legal supply, and (3) the current black market ivory factories and outlets in China are either brought into the legal system or put out of business.\nI mention only China in outcome 3 because China is the elephant in the room, so to speak. With 1.4 billion people and an economy that will soon be the largest in the world, coupled with a cultural desire for ivory, the Chinese control the fate of elephants.\nIf these three outcomes can be achieved, all of the concerns about corruption and leakage of illegal ivory into the legal supply chain outlined in Bennett’s essay can be avoided. I will explain why.\n(1) Ivory factory owners, whether they be a State Owned Enterprise (SOE) in China or privately owned, have the same basic objectives—make a profit and stay in business. If a legal business achieves those two objectives better than an illegal one, the rational owner or manager will choose the legal option. So if legal raw ivory can be provided in sufficient quantity at predictable times at an acceptable price, there will be no incentive to buy higher risk illegal ivory.\nIn addition, there are advantages that legal raw ivory in China offers: It is much cheaper than illegal, and legal supply is predictable, while illegal supply because of seizures is not. The only reason an illegal market operates at all is the lack of sufficient legal supply, which is controlled by the government at 5-6 tons a year.\nIf 40-50 tons of legal raw ivory could be supplied a year, all of the currently illegal factories could be drawn into the legal system by the offer of low-risk, high-gain legal ivory. They would not need to buy illegal ivory, eliminating the motivation to launder (i.e. buy illegal and mix with the legal).\nThe reduction in demand for illegal ivory would drive its price down to a level that would become unattractive for most traffickers, which would lower poaching and quash speculative buying and stockpiling. Who would stockpile a commodity whose price is falling?\nCurrently, the Chinese government is selling legal raw ivory at about $600 a kilogram on average to registered ivory factories, according to Moyle and Conrad. Illegal factories are paying an average of $2,100 a kilogram according to Martin and Vigne, and Gao found that secondary raw ivory dealing on the Internet reached prices up to $2,800 a kilogram.\nWhat factory owner in his or her right mind would buy poached tusks at those prices if legal ones were available at $600 a kilogram?\n(2) Consumer demand can be driven down in two ways, one of them already succeeding in China and Japan—price. The main reason consumer demand started falling in 2012 in China is that carved ivory prices reached a limit few consumers were willing to pay. I believe this was intentional in the legal market and coincidentally necessary in the illegal market.\nBecause of the very small quotas of raw ivory rationed to legal factories, they opted to produce low quantity, high quality, high price items—mainly elaborate figurines, carved or polished tusks, and extravagant composite pieces. Only the wealthy could afford to buy them. The huge profit per item compensated for the low volume.\n \nBecause of low legal raw ivory supply, legal ivory factories in China pursue a strategy of producing mostly low volume, highly priced items. Photograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nThe illegal market sector is forced to charge higher prices than in 2010 because the raw ivory they use has gone up in cost so much recently, currently to more than $2,000 a kilogram. Because they have to sell in high volume, they manufacture mostly the smaller, less expensive items such as diminutive, lower quality figurines, jewelry, name seal blanks, chopsticks, and other knick-knacks. They are not able to produce the high quality items the legal sector does because, with a few exceptions perhaps, the master craftsmen work in the legal sector.\nIt is Versace versus Wal-Mart applied to ivory.\nTo drive overall ivory consumption down, the entire ivory market must be shifted more toward the Versace model.\nThis is where the second way to drive consumer demand down comes in—campaigns of the type WildAid, Save the Elephants, African Wildlife Foundation, and others have launched. Create awareness about the harm buying ivory causes to elephants. Target especially jewelry and other items that are seen in public, create stigma associated with wearing or using ivory items, as was done with fur. Combined with high prices, stigma could lower demand considerably for ivory bracelets, necklaces, cigarette holders, and so on produced in the black market.\n3) In a sustained, legal ivory trade system the Chinese government is crucial to achieve the outcome of doing away with the black market. The traditional carrot- and-stick approach can be used to entice the illegal factories to register and join the legal, regulated system. They can be offered a quota of legal ivory annually at relatively low cost. The owner and employees of any unregistered factories found operating after a certain date would suffer severe penalties. Why would a factory owner choose to take the risk of staying in the black market when low-cost, legal ivory was on offer?\nSupply and Demand\nFor the system above to work, it depends on there being enough legal raw ivory available to bring a high proportion of illegal ivory factories on board the legal boat, and being able to satisfy consumer demand reasonably well. A small amount of residual illegal activity is to be expected, but the overall objective of significantly reducing elephant poaching can be achieved.\nA document submitted at the 65th CITES Standing Committee meeting in July this year stated that the “current African ivory stockpiles contain at least 800 [metric tons] of ivory… The true figure, however, may be considerably higher than that.” There are many complications involving what quantity would be legal to trade and which countries would meet CITES criteria to enable them to trade, but it is apparent that there’s a lot of ivory sitting in storerooms in Africa that is being wasted. It could be used to save elephant lives.\nKathleen Gobush produced the results of a lengthy study carried out for Save the Elephants last year that included estimates of how much ivory accumulates annually from natural mortality. Her methodology would yield 38 tons annually at a 4 percent natural mortality rate from only 12 African countries, where data were good enough to run her model. If problem animal control (PAC) ivory were added, the quantity would be much larger. She found that 44-67 percent of the legal ivory sold by the four southern African countries in 2008 derived from PAC ivory, and the remainder from natural deaths.\nWhile no exact figure can be put at present on how much ivory would be available from stockpiles, natural mortality and PAC combined, I am confident that a minimum of 60 tons of legal ivory could be exported from Africa annually for at least ten years, without a single poached tusk needed. During this ten-year period, intense demand-reduction campaigns can be mounted so that renewable resource ivory from natural deaths and PAC can supply demand sustainably.\nThe cheaper legal raw ivory should not translate to cheaper worked ivory, however. This could stimulate consumer demand. I would recommend that a “conservation tax” be applied to worked ivory to keep prices up, dampening demand. The revenues could be dedicated to conservation projects in Africa and awareness campaigns in China.\n \nTo prevent cheaper raw ivory translating to cheaper worked ivory, which would raise consumer demand, a conservation tax could be applied to keep prices high. Photograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nPreventing Leakage and Laundering\nLegal ivory stockpile quantities would be reported annually to CITES, as currently required. A country not reporting would not be eligible to sell its ivory. Every eligible country would be subject to periodic independent monitoring of its stockpile in a manner to be determined by CITES.\nCITES would supervise sales annually or semiannually following procedures established for the one-off sales. The significant difference being that now buyers would be confident that they’d know when, where, and how much ivory will be available in future. Uncertainty and speculation will be eliminated.\nThe ivory will be shipped in sealed containers directly from African government storerooms to Asian government receiving points in the purchasing countries for storage and distribution. This will cut out all of the points subject to corruption and laundering mentioned in the Bennett essay.\nIf this type of system can be established, I foresee that many African countries that currently export their ivory illegally, often with government involvement, will see the advantages of cleaning up their act so that they can qualify to enter the legal trade regime. Why take the risk of smuggling illegal ivory that is subject to confiscation when it can be sold legally, risk-free? The advantages will become increasingly apparent as poached ivory prices plummet with legal trade.\n“No Good Reason Why Anyone Needs Ivory”\nI agree completely with Beth Allgood’s sentiments expressed in Russo’s feature: There’s no good reason why anyone needs ivory. But not everyone feels the way Beth and I do, and we have to face reality. Some people want ivory. I do not see the attempt to ban all ivory succeeding better than allowing the limited, legal raw ivory trade described here. Closing the legal ivory market in China will only drive the master carvers and others into the illegal sector. The black market is already illegal, how much more illegal can it become with a total ban? It will carry on and even expand, fostering crime, corruption, and continued elephant killing.\nElephants cannot survive the continued ivory trade ban and “Stop Ivory.” They can thrive with legal trade.\nDaniel Stiles is a member of the IUCN/SSC African Elephant Specialist Group .\nKeywords\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nWithout them, rhinos, elephants, ...

So it’s a bit risky for the rangers who arrest them.”\n“This thing of arrest, it throws us backwards to winning this war of poaching. The more that are arrested, the more they are replaced by new poachers.”\n“In courts things turn ugly for most of our rangers who killed poachers due to poachers kingpins paying prosecutors money to let their associates off the hook.

Here are the highlights from that report (via Rachael Bale @ National Geographic ):\nNo one’s tracing guns. The Small Arms Survey found that weapons and ammo collected at poaching sites are rarely entered into Interpol’s firearms tracing system, even though doing so could help law enforcement track criminal networks as well as build cases against major players.\n“It’s difficult,” Carlson said. “A lot of African countries do not have the capacity to carry out the types of forensic activity that is required.”\nGovernments need to do a better job securing seized weapons. There have been at least a couple of cases where guns seized by police in Mozambique later showed up at poaching sites. That means either the police did a pretty bad job of storing the weapons in the first place, or they actually helped leak the weapons to the poachers.\nKWS (Kenya Wildlife Service) with confiscated guns and ammo from poachers. photo: Tony Karumba\nIt’s just too easy to get a gun in Africa. Aside from leaky stockpiles of seized weapons, there are plenty of other ways for poachers to get guns. Wealthy Sudanese businessmen have been known to provide guns, night vision goggles, and other equipment to poaching teams, the survey researchers were told. Sometimes it’s the military itself using state-issued guns to do the illegal killing. And there are plenty of people willing to trade guns for ivory. A 2015 National Geographic investigation found support for the claim that Sudan’s military trades guns to the brutal Lord’s Resistance Army in exchange for ivory, and other armed groups in Central Africa are also suspected to be trading ivory for guns.\nMilitary-style rifles are cheaper. Large-scale poachers tend to prefer hunting rifles—with their long range and ability to take down an elephant or rhino with a single shot—the report says. But assault rifles and light machine guns are really growing in popularity, especially among the highly organized poaching groups. Military-style weapons in the vein of Kalashnikovs are cheaper (so is their ammo) and easier to come by than hunting rifles. Guns have been documented coming from Libya, Angola, Burundi, Mozambique, Sudan, and South Sudan.\n \nPosted on July 18, 2016 by Tisha Wardlow\nWith terrorism overshadowing our daily lives on a global level , it’s easy for the poaching epidemic to take a backseat on the list of top concerns. Yet, there is an undeniable link between the two.\nFor groups like Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab, Al-Qaeda, *up to 40% of the organizational funding for weapons, training, basic supplies and operational costs; come from ivory.\nGetty Images\nThese groups are often the “middle men” along the chain of trade. Paying poachers less than $100 usd to do the dirty work, they gain approximately $2000/kilo in the sale of the ivory. Rhino horn is also a valued commodity for the terrorists, at a whopping $65000/kilo on the black market. An easy cash flow with little risk.\nStopping the actual poachers is meaningless, if others along the chain are not sought out. And in this case, stopping the middle men means ending the bloodshed for more than just rhinos and elephants.\n*Investigation by  Nir Kalron (Founder & CEO of Maisha Consulting) and Andrea Crosta (Executive Director & Co-Founder of the Elephant Action League)\n \nPosted on June 27, 2016 by Tisha Wardlow\nRhinos horns have been coveted as a use in traditional Chinese medicine for over 2000 years.\nOver the last few years, rhino horn powder has trended as a status symbol in Vietnam.

They  prefer wild “products” over farm-raised,as they see more worth in them. Wild animals are thought to be more potent as well.\nTiger wine, made from their bones, is being kept or “aged” with hopes of increased value if they become extinct. photo: unknown\nEndangered species have become the new collectible. According to John R Platt ,  as more collectors have entered the market, killing endangered species has grown increasingly profitable. Ivory wholesale prices, for example, have shot up from $564 per kilogram in 2006 to at least $2,100 today.\nJust one rhino horn nets about $100,000. Helmeted Hornbill beak can fetch over $6,000 per kg, and a tiger skin rug is worth $124,000.\nHelmeted hornbills, from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, are so rare, numbers are not quantified.

After explaining where the tusks come from and the burn they agreed to pose with a tusk. It’s raw form is not beautiful or shiny; it is smelly, dirty and has hack marks on it. I explained why. At first she had no words. she just stared at the stacks. Then she called her friend and said, “I will tell Chinese people not to buy ivory”.\nThis was the experience of Paula Kahumbu, conservationist and CEO of Wildlife Direct , discussing Kenya’s upcoming ivory burn.\nThe largest burn in history: 106 tonnes of ivory, 10,000 dead elephants (or to put in in perspective a 30 mile train of elephants trunk to tail) will be destroyed April 30th in Kenya\nMore than a “display”, the burn will transpire after a much larger event, the Giant’s Club Summit . African leaders, corporate leaders, members of the UN, USFWS (US Fish and Wildlife Service), and conservationists are among some of the approximate 200 invitees.\nThis event demonstrates not only the commitment of the Kenyan government to protecting its wildlife, but also gives hope and encouragement to neighboring countries, and the world.\nKahumbu believes Kenya has “turned the corner” in its ongoing struggle with poaching. Elephant poaching has decreased by a whopping 80%, and rhino poaching by 90% in the country. Although the battle is far from over, conservationists are finally beginning to even the playing field.\nElephant herd in Amboseli. photo: FFR\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nThe problem is that elephants and rhinos exist throughout the African ...

(This was a year AFTER China assured CITES they had no intention of farming rhinos.)\n         Rhino farm in China, photo-Al Jazeera\nPreviously, in 2009, a  TRAFFIC report showed that South Africa and Zimbabwe had exported 141 live Rhinoceros to China over the previous nine years.\nThe “park” Africa View was touted as an African safari themed park. However, when a reporter visited in 2008 he found “No animals were in evidence, save 60 or so rhinos living in rows of concrete pens.”(which he photographed)\n    The Sanya rhino farm location. photo: the Hub\nThe Sanya City Center is one of the prime farm locations. This area is also known to farm sea horses, bears, tigers, and deer.\nPosted on February 4, 2016 by Tisha Wardlow\nGetting serious about preserving rhinos entails international cooperation. The first step is to set a definitive standard which all countries can and will be responsible for.\nThe way to do this is through CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). CITES is an international agreement between participating countries that sets the standard to regulate wildlife imports and exports among them.\nThe group meets once every 3 years in different countries to discuss varying proposals. This year, in September they will meet in South Africa.\nDepending on their level of vulnerability, species are listed in three categories called Appendices.  Appendix I is the most vulnerable (threatened with extinction) and Appendix III is the least vulnerable.\nBlack rhinos are listed under Appendix I, but white rhinos are listed under Appendix II (for the exclusive purpose of allowing international trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable destinations and hunting trophies).\ngraphic: United for Wildlife\nConservationists are advocating for CITES to upgrade ALL rhinos to Appendix I.\nWhat this will accomplish is to make it illegal to transport rhinos out of the country; ending the trade debate, as well as the majority of trophy hunting of rhinos.\nAs the rate of poaching continues unabated, it only seems logical to offer them the utmost protection on an international level. Please read and sign the following petition to ask the head of CITES to make this a priority.\n \nPosted on October 16, 2015 by Tisha Wardlow\nphoto: Tisha Wardlow/Fight for Rhinos\nChina’s State Forestry Administration said in a statement posted on its website that it would “temporarily prohibit” trophy imports until Oct. 15, 2016 and “suspend the acceptance of relevant administrative permits”.\nChinese media quoted the “relevant SFA official” as saying the temporary suspension was designed to give authorities time to evaluate its effectiveness, and possibly take further, more effective measures in future.\nAre they feeling the pressure from the rest of the world? Are they serious about trying to make a difference? What good does a year do?\nPardon the skepticism, but let’s look at China’s track record.\n“In 2002, China was the principal driver of the illegal trade and made very few seizures,” said Tom Milliken, director of eastern and southern African operations for Traffic, which monitors the trade and advises Cites.\nIn 2008 South Africa initiated a one-off sale of stored ivory. This brief sale, though legal, renewed interest and increased demand within the Chinese culture. Ivory prices skyrocketed, but the “legal supply” was exhausted. Immediately following this sale, according to CITES, “record levels of ivory were seized and sustained throughout the period 2009 to 2011.”\nIn January of 2014 and May of 2015 China destroyed ivory in a public crush. Yet China officially sanctions 36 ivory-carving workshops. Every year they assign a quota of 5 to 6 tons of “legal” ivory to the carving industry.\nCounterproductive to say the least.\nIn fact according to the Environmental Investigation Agency, when you talk to the ivory dealers they say that amount of allocation only lasts one month. And so the other 11 months is illegal ivory. In an undercover investigation, the carvers admit “at least 90% of the ivory in China is illegal.”\nOne of 36 ivory carving factories in China. photo: Brent Stirton\nTo think there will be no compromise to said “prohibition” within the year or that the government won’t deem the ban suddenly unnecessary is unrealistic.\nBut if there is a silver lining it is this: the very fact the  government feels compelled to alter a centuries old tradition by this display means they are feeling the world pressure. There is hope.\n \nPosted on August 21, 2015 by Tisha Wardlow\nIt seems time to address the idea of legal horn trade again.  We understand the desire to try almost anything to save our rhinos. But it is our opinion that entertaining legal trade is not one of them.  There are far more reasons why legalizing rhino horn is a BAD idea.\n#1 The number of rhinos left does NOT support the extreme demand for horn.\n#2 We KNOW by flooding the market with something, it does not alleviate the demand, but on the contrary, increases it. Case and point-bears and tigers. China’s “farming” of them, has only expanded the market, in addition to leaving the animals in horrible health, with shortened lives (see The Legal Trade Myths: Debunked by Annamiticus)\n#3 Members of CITES would need to approve the measure, which they have all spoken up on with a definite NO, including China.\n#4  Not all animals are easily farmed. Rhinos succumb to conditions in close quarters with one another, in which they are unaffected by in the wild. In addition, it is a costly endeavor, both for veterinary and security costs. Most individuals would not even be able to achieve this. ( see: The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions)\n#5 Certain Asian communities ONLY want wild rhino horn. The mindset is that it is more valued because it is harder to come by. Therefore farmed horn will be meaningless to them.\n#6 Corruption is rampant not only in South Africa, but in so much having to do with rhino horn. IF trade were legalized, WHO is trusted to police the system? Even during the time ivory was allowed legally in a one-off sale, there was corruption and selling of illegal ivory. ( see AWF Ivory )\n#7 Asian attitudes on horn are changing, more awareness is taking hold. By making horn legal for a short time then pulling it back off the market, it stands to confuse consumers, re-fuel current demand, as well as possibly reaching a larger market because of the legality.\nOne-off sales have not worked before, there is no evidence to show it would work now. In fact, the opposite is true. If we are serious about stopping poaching, we must stop the demand. It must be loud, clear and forceful that trade and demand are NOT options.\nAt the very least the idea of legal trade is an enormous risk. It is an action where there is no turning back, and if the worst case scenarios are realized, the rhinos would be gone forever.\n \n \nPosted on July 16, 2015 by Tisha Wardlow\nTo crush or hoard?\nThat is the dilemma for African countries with ivory stockpiles. It’s a polarizing debate. Destruction eliminates any and all possibility at corruption, it will not find its way back on the market and it sends a clear message ivory NOT attached to the animal has no value.\nBut the other side believes saving and selling the ivory allows the money to be rolled back over into conservation efforts for the animals, and the communities.\nThe problem is that elephants and rhinos exist throughout the African continent, making the “product” available in multiple countries, and each country has its own stance on stockpiling. So while Mozambique destroys ivory, directly across the border in Zimbabwe the country stores it, awaiting an opportunity to sell. This creates mixed messages and a lack of unity.\nSeized horns and tusks on display in Hong Kong. Photo: Reuters\nSelling Ivory Funds Communities\nNamibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa have a stock and sell take on ivory.\nNamibia  Minister of Environment and Tourism Pohamba Shifeta has said destroying the ivory and horn goes against government policy. Instead the stock is auctioned off to other interested countries.\n“We will get a lot of money and the proceeds will go to state coffers to alleviate poverty. Also, we feel it is not an effective deterrent in fighting poaching,” said Shifeta.\nWhile Botswana states it is “out of the question” to sell rhino horn, they’ve just announced they will seek permission to sell their ivory stockpile after the 10 years moratorium with CITES has expired in 2018.\nGood news for the rhinos, considering the fact that Botswana is key to future rhino populations with the current translocations taking place from Kruger National Park.  Not so great for elephants.\nOverall,  an interesting proposition considering the country’s strong stance on anti-poaching, and the large stake in their wildlife. 90% of tourists in Botswana come for the wildlife.\nThe wildlife tourism industry is estimated to continue to grow throughout the coming years, making it an invaluable component to the economy. Graph: World Travel & Tourism Council\n \n Destroy Ivory, Stop Poaching\nKenya, Mozambique, Malawi and Ethiopia have all held public burns/crushes to destroy their stockpiles of horn and ivory.\nKenya Wildlife Service (KWS) spokesman Paul Udoto says the illegal ivory has no economic value to them, saying that “the selling is what has brought us to the state of poaching that we are in.”\nKenya burned 15 tonnes of ivory in March. President Kenyatta has vowed the entire stockpile will be burned this year. AFP photo\nOne-off Sales\nSo the hoard and sell leads to occasional one-off sales of a set amount for a limited time.\nIt is the belief of some that by CITES issuing these sales of horn or ivory, it fans the flames and results in a poaching spike, sending elephant and rhino populations into a tailspin. Afterall how can we  allow LEGAL one-off sales of a product AND simultaneously strive at reducing demand for the same product? Confusing to say the least.\nThe experts who work with elephants are in agreement.\nIt is very discouraging having to fight the battle to save elephants once again. The 1989 ban helped elephants to recover in most parts of Africa. Now even in Amboseli we’re losing elephants to ivory poachers for the first time in many years. The sale of any ivory–legal or not–is creating demand. No one needs ivory. It is a beautiful substance, but the only ones who need it are elephants.\n– Cynthia Moss, Amboseli Elephant Research Project\nAs long as ivory is valued as a commodity, every tusker is at risk from poachers, and only where anti-poaching efforts are sufficient will elephants survive. Anti-poaching costs money and lives. Banning the ivory trade has been the single-most effective and economical way to slow the loss of elephants across their whole range – not just where they can be protected by anti-poaching units. \n–Ian Redmond, OBE Wildlife biologist and Ambassador for the UNEP Convention on Migratory Species\nSo who do we listen to? The experts who work with these creatures, seeing their lives and deaths and the daily effects of poaching? Or political officials with a mixed bag of agendas?\nIf we must view elephants, rhinos or other animal in economic terms, then we must factor in tourism. Without wildlife, there is no tourism.

Yet the South African DEA (Department of Environmental Affairs) continues their push of legal trade, unabated.\nAside from the usual and obvious arguments with legal trade, there are three definitive reasons why legal trade would fail:\nCITES\nCITES ( Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) representatives, including China’s have recommended against it. In fact, Wan Ziming, the head of China’s representing party at CITES, told Oxpeckers he was concerned that “the legitimate horn supply would be insufficient to meet the demand.”\nWithout the backing from CITES trade could not happen. “With almost every country having banned rhino horn, I have no idea of any country that would be willing to import rhino horn stockpile from South Africa,”said Ziming.\nPAST ONE-OFF SALES\nIn 2008 South Africa initiated a one-off sale of stored ivory. This brief sale, though legal, renewed interest and increased demand within the Chinese culture. Ivory prices skyrocketed, but the “legal supply” was exhausted.\nImmediately following this sale, according to CITES, “record levels of ivory were seized and sustained throughout the period 2009 to 2011.”\nIn addition to confusing consumers, the IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare) conducted a survey that clearly showed that illegal ivory can be laundered freely through the legal market. In fact illegal trade activity often took place in legal facilities.\nIf China cannot (or will not) govern the legal trade, there is no point.\nTIGERS \nTwenty years ago China banned the sale and use of tiger bone. Yet tiger farms have cropped up all over the country for the sole purpose of killing and utilizing the animal parts. Instead of stepping up enforcement, China caved to public pressure and wildlife authorities issued licenses for “wineries” and “taxidermists”, stimulating the demand.\nIt costs as little as US $15 to kill a wild tiger compared to US $7,000 to farm an animal to maturity. This profit margin offers substantial incentives for poaching tigers in the wild. Since it is impossible to distinguish between farm-raised tigers and their wild counterparts from their bones and other parts, farming tigers for trade creates enormous difficulties for law enforcement, and provides opportunities to “launder” products made from wild tigers.**\nThe same is true for ivory and horn. It is virtually impossible to distinguish the difference between “legal” or “old” ivory and “illegal” or “poached” ivory.\nPerhaps it’s time for South Africa government to stop counting cash from sales that won’t come to fruition, and go with Plan B: get serious about poaching through laws and political will.\n(**from the UN Chronicle)\n \nPosted on July 13, 2014 by Tisha Wardlow\nAnother CITES  meeting has come and gone. So what does it mean for rhinos?\nIn 2013 Vietnam and Mozambique were directed to strengthen their efforts on poaching and the trade of rhino horn.\nVietnam\nVietnam’s report to CITES, indicates they are taking steps to improve the situation, including initiating a rhinoceros horn demand reduction programme and tweaking their laws and regulations.\nAccording to CITES,  “It is evident that Vietnam has managed to set in motion a political momentum to combat illegal wildlife trade, which has significantly contributed to tangible progress in its efforts to implement measures to combat illegal rhinoceros horn trade more effectively.”\nAlthough encouraging, according to Save the Rhino, one area of concern is the limited custodial sentences for trafficking rhino horn, which they have acknowledged is an area for improvement. Heavy sentencing is a crucial deterrent to those involved in rhino horn trafficking.\nIn March, Vietnam Deputy Minister Ha Cong Tuan stated they were considering destroying it’s storage of horns.\nMozambique\nMozambique, according to their own reports, had a notable increase in arrests and fines. They have also stated they have provided new equipment to field rangers, resettlement of villages close to the border with the Kruger National Park, established an “Intensive Protection Zone” along the length of the border with the Park, and increased cross border co-operation.\nIn addition they have signed the MOU (memorandum of understanding) with South Africa.\nThese statements beg further explanation. The villages “close to the border” are where the area known as “Poachers Alley” exists. And the protection zone- is it for protection of rhinos or poachers?\nCITES is urging Mozambique to develop a national rhino horn action plan, with time-frames and milestones, and submit this to the CITES Secretariat by 8 August 2014.  According to reports, Europe and the US are ready to issue sanctions if necessary.\nAs the Environmental Investigation Agency has recently indicated in its petition to President Obama,  \n“Available evidence indicates that Mozambican nationals constitute the highest number of foreign arrests for poaching in South Africa. Organized crime syndicates based in Mozambique are driving large-scale illegal trade in rhino horn and elephant ivory”\nMoz Minister of Tourism, Carvalho Muaria, signs the MOU with South Africa.\nChina\nThe CITES report does not indicate anything with China regarding rhino horn trade.\nBut China was allegedly, vehemently complaining about the necessity of reporting its status to CITES.  In addition for the first time, they admitted to using Tiger parts (well only some of them). A Chinese delegate said, “we don’t ban trade in tiger skins but we do ban trade in tiger bones”.\nThere was also no mention of Thailand or Hong Kong.\nPosted on July 10, 2014 by Tisha Wardlow\nCITES is currently meeting again. Discussions on the fate of our rhinos are taking place as you’re reading this.\nAs poachers kill, and rangers fight, CITES is talking. While the slaughter continues, CITES is handing out certificates.\nNepal, China, Kenya and the Lusaka Agreement Task Force recognized for exemplary enforcement efforts.\nLooking at the CITES agenda , some of the recommendations on the rhino are as follows:\n*Mozambique should develop a national rhino horn action plan, with timeframes and milestones, and submit this to the Secreteriat by 8th August 2014.\n*Mozambique is requested to submit a comprehensive report on progress in the implementation of its national rhino action plan, and on any other action taken… to be submitted to the Secretariat by 31st January 2015.\n*Viet Nam is requested to provide a further comprehensive report on actions taken…including, in particular, by providing an update on the implementation of the Prime Minister’s Directive On strengthening the direction and implementation of measures for controlling and protecting endangered, rare and precious wild animals, and a detailed update on update on arrests, seizures, prosecutions and penalties for offences related to illegal rhinoceros horn possession and trade in Viet Nam…to be submitted to the Secretariat by 31st January 2015.\nAnd what happens if they don’t receive these reports? Or if the reports are showing these countries are failing? Non-compliance will be met with….what?\n558 rhinos have been killed this year (OSCAP)\nIt is time to enact sanctions against the offending parties. Our wildlife deserves better than “talk”. It is time for action, swift and decisive action. There isn’t time for anything else.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\n... the 1989 ban, and it opened the gates and led the way ... rhinos, with poaching steadily increasing and ... Elephants & Rhinos” is a ... Opinion: Irrelevant, Illogical, and Illegal–24 Experts ... Opinion: Irrelevant, Illogical, and Illegal–24 Experts Respond to Arguments Supporting Legalization of the Ivory Trade – National Geographic Society (blogs)\nPRELUDE\nThe Inherent Contradiction – Iain Douglas-Hamilton, DPhil, OBE, Save the Elephants\nDan Stiles is a serious field researcher, so his article deserves serious review. However his essay “Can Elephants Survive a Continued Ivory Trade Ban?” is both confused and confusing—he leads with the idea that he will be guided by the evidential truth, then proceeds to advance a series of his own largely unsupported opinions—and the crux of his argument contains the seed of its own destruction. \nHe strongly endorses campaigns to reduce the demand for ivory, telling us that demand for ivory is an evil which is driving the killing of elephants and that he would never like to own ivory himself, but in the same breath states that the only salvation for elephants is to institute a legal trade. There is an inherent contradiction between these two policies, which he has evidently not understood. Any trade at all promotes demand and results in killing elephants.  A domestic ivory trade ban is not only about stopping ivory commerce: it is also the strongest possible endorsement of demand reduction that a government can make. To make some ivory legal and the rest illegal is a failed policy that only confuses the public, and has had disastrous consequences.\nThis contradiction of endorsing two incompatible policies is the main flaw in Stiles’s argument, in my opinion, but there are many other fallacies in his presentation which should also be exposed.\n \nI: CONTEXT, EVIDENCE, AND EXPERIENCE\nRewriting History to Promote Versace-Only-Ivory-Chic – Dr. Joyce Poole, Co-Director, ElephantVoices \nDr. Stiles’s premise that Hong Kong and Japan were stockpiling ivory in the 1980s because a “ban was on the way” is a rewriting of history. CITES started the ivory quota system in 1985 because illegal killing of elephants was unsustainable, true. But even in 1987 none of the relevant institutional bodies was considering a closure of the trade. In late 1988, when Cynthia Moss and I began a public awareness campaign with the African Wildlife Foundation, we had to argue against a leading conservation organization whose opinion was still that the ivory trade was “good” for elephants.\nIt was only in 1989, when our “ only elephants should wear ivory ” campaign was in full swing, the Ivory Trade Review Group had compiled its report, Richard Leakey had persuaded President Moi to burn Kenya’s stockpile , and moratoria on trading in ivory fell into place, that a ban looked possible. I know this as I worked with the Tanzanian authorities to compile the Appendix I proposal and was among a small delegation that traveled to Japan and Hong Kong in July 1989 to discuss a possible closure of trade with government officials, ivory traders, and carvers and to try to get them on board. \nFurthermore, it was not the ban on international trade per se that drove down the illegal killing in the early 1990s; rather it was the ban, together with public awareness campaigns, that strove to stigmatize the buying, selling, and wearing of ivory.\nLikewise, the increase in poaching began after populations were down-listed to Appendix II, discussions about stockpiles and trade were renewed, AND the storyline from the media had swung from one of slaughter to one of human-elephant conflict. The message to potential buyers had changed. It would seem that Stiles does not understand the drivers of fashion in light of his arguments for driving down demand for ivory through public awareness (targeting the “Walmart” mass market) while promoting a “Versace” type high-end trade. The masses aspire to what the wealthy purchase. It is not possible to promote trade with one hand and stigmatize it with the other.\n \nSpeculative Stockpiling – Francisco Aguayo, economist, independent consultant and PhD Fellow, Maastricht Economic Research and Training Institute on Technology and Innovation, Maastricht University, the Netherlands\nStiles’s essay about the drivers of ivory markets is inconsistent, unsupported, and misleading. The reasoning is the usual: Poaching is driven by scarcity, and any attempt to reduce supply only undermines regulation. The difference with other pro-trade proposals is the prominent role of speculative stockpiling. Although his article highlights important forces acting along the supply chain, Dr. Stiles’s claims on the drivers of ivory markets are simple conjectures lacking data about market conditions or knowledge about market dynamics.\nTo support the claim that stockpiling, and not demand, drives poaching one should show that ivory stocks accumulated beyond reasonable expectations on demand. Stiles not only assumes (wrongly) that stockpiling is always speculative and independent of demand but also fails to show any hard figures other than single time-points on stocks. The truth is that no one really knows the size of market demand or the dimensions of illegal stocks.\nLack of data is accompanied by lack of rigor: the effects of the 1999 one-off sale can only be reasonably measured by comparing against some point after the 1989 ban, not before, as Stiles does. The fact that the ivory carving industry in China, Taiwan, and Japan had lower activity levels in 2003 compared to those before 1989 only shows that the ban had an important dislocation effect on the industry (especially true in the case of Japan where—as Stiles himself showed in his 2003 survey with Martin—annual consumption dropped from 300 to 15 tons a year).\nFinally, Stiles’s assessment of China’s recent market dynamics replicates many of the  shortcomings of other superficial economic analyses  of wildlife trade: the notions that markets are indicators of scarcity, that demand is stable, autonomous, and controllable through prices, and that markets are fundamentally homogeneous, static entities. Policy recommendations require more solid information and rigorous analysis, especially in times of crisis.\n \nExtraction Is Theft – Prof. Andy Dobson, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., U.S.A.\nThe “empirical argument” that Stiles makes about Japan stockpiling ivory to await the economic emergence of China is flawed on multiple points. Would this argument also apply to the vast volume of minerals and timber that China is extracting from Africa? Would this problem have simply not arisen if Japan had stockpiled these commodities for an economic rainy day? I think not!\nIf there was no ivory trade, then the ivory carvers could retrain in any of the multiple industries that epitomize the Far-Eastern economic boom. If all else fails, they could carve stone or wood: The Inuit carvers of Nunavut work almost exclusively in granite, despite access to walrus tusks and caribou antlers. Their work is ultimately more valuable and aesthetically pleasing, as it reflects their lifestyle and an inherent desire to see it preserved.\nAn ivory carving can be viewed as little more than a gaudy trinket from an illegally dead elephant stolen from another continent and another culture. I see very little to value aesthetically or morally in artworks created from illegally poached sentient animals.\nA new wave of contemporary Chinese artists are currently exhibiting their work at the U.K.’s largest ever exhibition of contemporary art from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong ; they’re using artistic media other than ivory, such as brass, wood, porcelain, paint, video, flags, paper, and street lights, according to Ian Youngs, Arts reporter for BBC news. Ultimately, innovative artists in China do not need ivory to create art. Ethical buyers and dealers should have no need to tarnish their reputations by dealing in blood ivory.\n \nOne-off Sales Did Not Stem Demand for Illegal Ivory – Dan Bucknell and Charlie Mayhew, Tusk Trust\nThe reasons that we’re still having this debate are threefold. First, there is great expertise and years of experience on both sides of the argument, which has become further clouded by emotions and politics. Second, there are so many variables associated with the trade in ivory— whether legal or illegal—that it has become too difficult to disentangle causation from correlation. Third, despite numerous attempts to identify an analogous market to back up the arguments on either side (including narcotics, minerals, timber, numerous other wildlife products, etc.), the variables are again too great for one to model the outcome of any decisions with any certainty. The only thing we can say with any certainty is that if there is no demand for ivory at all, there will be no market, and no illegal killing of elephants.\nThere have been many drivers behind the surge in ivory poaching, and it’s again difficult to pinpoint any single key driver. As well as those that Dan Stiles has mentioned, the economic growth and burgeoning middle-class with disposable incomes in China and the increased business links between China and African elephant range states are also key factors. Proponents of the pro-trade argument have gone to great lengths in their efforts to disprove a link between the 2008 one-off ivory sale and the increase in the illegal ivory trade, and vice versa. Other factors are involved, but whatever the case, the one-off sale certainly did nothing to stem the demand for illegal ivory, and it created confusion in the consumer market as to whether ivory was legal or illegal, allowing organized crime to take full advantage. \n \nMore of the Same Again? It’s Time to Stop Putting a Price Tag on Ivory and Turn the Tide Against Wildlife Crime – Shruti Suresh, Wildlife Campaigner and Lawyer, Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA)\nAny parallel legal trade in the parts and products of vulnerable species that continue to be threatened by trade, such as elephants, rhinos, and tigers, poses a serious threat to the survival of these species in the wild.\nStiles argues that “more of the same” would not be successful in reducing poaching—i.e., a ban on trade in ivory has been tried and has not worked. This is based on an invalid assumption that there has been a perpetual ivory ban that has been effectively implemented, when in fact there is a thriving legal domestic market for ivory in China which also happens to be the primary destination country for illegal ivory.\nStiles’s solution of solving the elephant poaching crisis by allowing China and Japan to purchase approximately 65 tons of legal raw ivory annually is naïve and ignores the overwhelming evidence obtained during recent years, which has confirmed the failure of a legal trade in ivory to curb the illicit trade.\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has more than 30 years of experience in investigating and exposing the international illicit trade in ivory. EIA undercover investigators have encountered a range of players across the ivory trade chain—from poachers and smugglers in Africa to ivory dealers and retailers in China. These undercover investigations have yielded rich insights into the driving factors of the trade and the perceptions of criminals involved in it.\nFor example, EIA investigations have confirmed that the legal sale of stockpiled ivory to China and Japan in 2008 failed to either reduce the price of ivory or curb the illicit ivory trade in China. Instead we found that the retail price of legal ivory represented a massive mark-up and that the control system to regulate legal ivory was a failure to such an extent that the perception of both legal and illegal traders was that up to 90 percent of the ivory available on the market came from illegal sources.\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the internationally renowned expert in fighting drug trafficking and international crime, has advised that an unequivocal ban on trade in ivory would have a positive impact in combating the illicit trade in ivory: “The trade in illicit ivory is only lucrative because there is a parallel licit supply, and ivory can be sold and used openly. Ivory would lose much of its marketability if buying it were unequivocally an illegal act, or if ownership of these status goods had to be concealed.”\nThe CITES Secretariat has reported that, “Because China allows internal ivory trade under a control system that was previously vetted through a CITES process, the ongoing flow of large volumes of illegal ivory to China suggests that such ivory may be moving into legal ivory trade channels.” There is no doubt that the legal ivory trade has provided an avenue for laundering of illegal ivory and has in this manner certainly exacerbated the illegal trade.\nStiles also ignores the implications of the serious level of criminality and the role of organized criminal networks in the ivory trade and instead wrongly assumes that wildlife laws and other related laws are being effectively enforced to implement the ivory trade ban.\nIn the 1980s, EIA documented the role of the Poon family, a sophisticated and organized transnational criminal network engaged in trafficking ivory from Africa via the Middle East to East Asia. More than a decade later, EIA’s analysis of individuals and companies implicated in the world’s largest ivory seizure, in Singapore in 2002, revealed that members of the Poon network were still involved in the illegal ivory trade.\nTo this day, none of the key players involved in the 2002 seizure have been prosecuted. There is thus a widespread lack of effective criminal justice response against ivory trafficking, and we need to be focusing on fixing these underlying problems instead of contemplating a parallel legal trade system that would complicate enforcement even further.\nStiles suggests that allowing China and Japan to purchase legal ivory would greatly reduce the profitability of the trade and demand for ivory. With any legal trade, however, comes the rational desire to maximize profit and increase demand. This inevitably leads to associated marketing practices to expand demand and also the market for these products. For example, recent EIA investigations into a parallel legal trade in skins of captive tigers in China found the taxidermy industry to be actively promoting the use of tiger skin rugs as luxury home décor. Needless to say, this parallel legal trade has not stopped the poaching of wild tigers and instead presents a mechanism for laundering wild tiger skins.\n“Legalize it” may be a workable mantra for your run-of the-mill consumer products, but it is certainly not feasible for products sourced from finite and fast-depleting vulnerable wildlife.\nWe’ve tried a commercial legal trade in ivory, and it was a colossal failure. Let’s not try more of the same again. Now is the time to stop putting a price tag on ivory and start valuing it more on elephants in the wild.\n \nQuality of What You Get Out Depends on What You Put in – Susie Watts, Independent wildlife consultant\nCareless errors over the start date of calls for a ban on African elephant ivory trade, a lack of understanding of why commodities like ivory and rhino horn are stockpiled, no consideration of the difference between information gathered undercover and that given to tourists, coupled with wild assumptions about how “legal” ivory prices could be kept low in China, provide a very shaky foundation for the construction of Dr. Stiles’s argument. As with any analysis, the quality of what you get out depends on the quality of what you put in.\n \nTime Lags Are Real – Dr. Shermin de Silva, Fellow, Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (Institute for Advanced Study) and President and founder, Trunks & Leaves, U.S.A.\nApplying economic paradigms to biological systems with little understanding of biological data is as dangerous as doing the reverse. Stiles asserts that the initial ban on ivory not only failed to curtail demand but actually increased it in parts of Asia, such as Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, where elephant populations supposedly decreased by two-thirds in the decade following the ban, implying a causal link.\nIt’s as difficult to argue that the ban resulted in the decline of elephants in Asia as it is to demonstrate that two one-off sales caused the poaching epidemic. First, Asian elephants were largely wiped out in their native ranges owing to profligate ivory hunting and active eradication programs during the colonial era , then, more recently, by habitat loss. Hence they were already largely in decline in many parts of the world. Small, fragmented populations can decline at an accelerated pace once they are below a critical threshold, and it’s possible these populations were already past the brink.\nIt’s unclear how much of the decline occurred within the last two decades, given that proper population estimates for most countries did not, and still do not, exist. But it’s indeed possible that the ban on ivory did not eliminate demand overnight, that hunters turned to the remote, hidden, and poorly managed Asian populations when the highly visible African populations were protected with greater effort. African forest elephants have been similarly hard hit. Human and ecological systems respond with time lags .\nIf at all, this example only illustrates the difficulty of protecting cryptic species irrespective of the legal status of the ivory trade. Similarly, the response to the one-off sales may not have been immediate but propagated with time-lags, making arguments based on correlations (or lack thereof) from two data points somewhat of a speculative exercise, irrespective of the direction of the claims.\n \nCongolese Politics Are One of the Drivers of Poaching – Dr. John Hart, Directeur Scientifique et Technique, Fondation Lukuru, Projet Tshuapa-Lomami-Lualaba (TL2), Kinshasa, République Démocratique du Congo\nOne fact that keeps coming back to me is that long before the current upsurge in illegal ivory trafficking across the rest of the continent, colossal amounts of ivory (even by today’s standards) were leaving DRC . This was more than a decade ago, starting after 2002, but especially 2004-05. There were still a lot of elephants to be killed then.  \nI believe Congolese ivory was the first major movement of poached ivory following the 1989 ban, and it opened the gates and led the way to an expansion of illegal killing now surging through East Africa (a lot of Congolese ivory went out through Ugandan businessmen, and there was even an ivory futures market). \nWhere was the demand? China, Japan. Stiles’s article suggests Asia. But the easy movement of all that ivory (no one was arrested despite the documentation of illegal operatives) set the stage for the creation of exporting rackets in Mombasa and elsewhere over the next decade that remain to plague us today. They all got their start on the easy take and low arrest rates following the looting of Congo.\nAll of this happened with barely a blip on the international radar.\n \nRhino Horn and Ivory Trade—Already a Done Deal in South Africa? – Jabu Linden, Vhembe Biosphere Reserve, Limpopo, South Africa, and Bibi Linden, Zoology, University of Venda, Limpopo, South Africa\nStiles’s economic argument for the ivory trade is very worrying, given the lack of capacity to enforce regulation by the countries involved. Living in South Africa, we are witnessing a similar approach developing under the Environmental Affairs Minister, Edna Molewa, regarding rhino horn trade. Our ministry is clearly “pro-use” in its developing policies, but has the consultation really been open enough ?\nWhile we are not capable of protecting rhinos, with poaching steadily increasing and more than 630 killed so far this year, the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) moves vigorously in the pro-rhino-horn trade direction , receiving advice from a ministerial panel of experts (labeled as “secretive” by the press and who appear to be uniformly pro trade), selling the economic argument that engaging the markets will mitigate the catastrophe.\nAlso currently, the DEA process to revise the 2008 Elephant Norms and Standards (N&S) , citing inability or lack of a mandate to apply the regulations, is thought-provoking. The concept note, circulated as part of the stakeholder engagement process (comprising two workshops), is quite comprehensive in its listing of problems, and there are obviously a lot of grey areas in elephant management that the N&S do not satisfactorily address. A revision is clearly needed. Issues raised run from welfare of captive animals (noting that welfare is not DEA’s responsibility and following the recent, well-publicized removal of a few elephant calves from the wild) to the time-consuming nature of developing management plans for keeping elephants either in private reserves or communal land or for “eco-tourism activities.”\nNear the middle of the document, under “Control of wild elephant population sizes and distribution,” “not cull” is listed as an issue when it comes to population management. In a related DEA document entitled “Key challenges regarding the implementation and enforcement of the Elephant Norms and Standards in South Africa,” further questions are asked: “The Ecological Carrying Capacity is too rigid. Should the Economical Carrying Capacity not rather be used for the purpose of the N&S?”\nThe hotly contested issue of growing elephant populations and culling as a management tool asks the question: Are we being prepared for “pro-use” in line with our government lobbying hard for reopening the international ivory and rhino horn trades in 2016 ?\nIs our common ecological crisis, our loss of wild lands really to be solved by the monetary system that has pushed us to this brink? Is that what Daniel Stiles means when he says “we need to face reality”? Even if we in South Africa retain the capacity to manage (or indeed farm!) our fragmented rhino and elephant populations—which is questionable given recent developments—what is the impact of our stance on the survival of these species on the rest of our continent?\n(The views of the authors do not represent those of the organizations they are affiliated with).\n \nLet’s Keep the “Well-Meaning” Disparagement Out of the Debate – Ian Michler, environmental journalist for the Conservation Action Trust; Director, Eden to Addo   \nThere will no doubt be many insightful and highly experienced conservationists, journalists, and economists refuting the recent pro-trade assertions of Daniel Stiles. I too find his approach misguided and loaded with far too many vagaries to be acceptable. However, in this response I want rather to focus on a small point—that of approach and language use, as these are no less significant in the big picture.\nStiles also falls foul of the disparaging attitude that highlights the same clumsy thinking that continues to swirl within staunch “sustainable–use” circles. Having an anti-trade stance on wildlife issues, or opposing trophy hunting for that matter, is no more or less of a “campaign” than his own stance, and I can only assume that he believes and hopes his approach to be well-meaning?\nIf it is, then lay off the injudicious use of language that attempts to confer some greater claim of legitimacy on arguments put forward by the pro-use lobby. It’s a complete misconception that Africa speaks with a pro-use voice and that those who oppose are merely “well-meaning campaigns.” There is already a significant constituency spread across the continent that finds many of our current policies based on the use paradigm more akin to “sustainable abuse.” Oh, and we also care a lot about the elephants.     \n \nII: OBSTACLES TO LEGAL TRADE \nMarket manipulation is a central issue – Dr. Peter J. Li, Associate Professor of East Asian Politics, University of Houston-Downtown and China Policy Specialist, Humane Society International\nDaniel Stiles has underestimated the market manipulation role of the Chinese authorities. As long as the state controls the distribution of the legally imported raw ivory, favoring some businesses and at the expense of others, the “discriminated” ivory factory owners would have only one choice, i.e., to seek illegal ivory as a way to break or resist the unfair and unequal distribution system. Quantity of supply does not end illegal ivory purchase if the supply is distributed unequally or discriminately. It’s important to remember that the rising demand for ivory in China is caused not by supply uncertainty but by distribution inequality (state owned enterprises or other privileged private enterprises favored over others). And the rise of the ivory carving business is not a result of concern over supply uncertainty but reform of the state-owned enterprises, which led to the rise of private ivory carving businesses.\n \nWalmart Model Prevails – Dr. Pete Coppolillo, Executive Director, Working Dogs for Conservation\nStiles’s argument is built around a few idiosyncrasies of “the” ivory market, which he thinks the conservationists got wrong. He may be correct, but getting these details right won’t make the ivory trade sustainable. Furthermore, his hope for “a shift toward the Versace model” (from the “WalMart Model”) is, in a word, fanciful. Not even in the United States do we have the capacity to manage such a transition. How could we possibly expect to orchestrate this kind of control across numerous developing countries in Africa and Asia—and to do it in time to save elephants—when we haven’t accomplished it in the United States? \n \nThe Real World Is Not a Simple Supply and Demand Utopia – Dr. Keith Lindsay, Amboseli Trust for Elephants, Kenya\nThe analysis offered by Daniel Stiles and other trade proponents may be appealing, on its surface, because of its apparent simplicity. In their view, free trading by rational consumers in open markets for a readily available commodity will automatically find a satisfactory, stable equilibrium where everybody wins—people wanting ivory trinkets, carvers and middlemen supplying them, African governments desiring income from ivory sales for national treasuries or conservation, elephants themselves. In this ideal world where the market solves all problems on its own, what could be better?\nThis kind of thinking is typical of one particular school of economics, the so-called “neo-classical,” but while it is still popular nowadays, especially with fiscal conservatives and libertarians, there are many other approaches that more broad-minded economists (see Francisco Aguayo above) use to try to understand the way life works. In the real world, despite what neo-classical disciples would like us to believe, markets are not (and never have been) free but are often highly regulated and manipulated by governments, corporations, and middlemen traders acting in their own interests or for those they represent (e.g. citizens, investors); consumers are not entirely rational or omnisciently well-informed; production/productivity of commodities is at least as important as demand and price. Criminals, who are just middlemen operating outside of legal systems, understand these realities all too well.\nIvory is produced in complex ecosystems by living elephants growing and reproducing at slow rates; this low productivity cannot be boosted to meet even a modest rise in demand, making elephants particularly poised on the edge of over-exploitation. Treated as a product, ivory is not an isolated commodity but is only one of a great many wild animal and plant products that are exploited and traded on a vast scale, mainly in criminal networks with no monitoring of quantities or supply chains. Such networks and syndicates can easily undercut government efforts at protection and management of elephants and their ivory, because their overheads are much lower, and they have no qualms about sourcing their commodity directly from local criminals, corrupt officials, or even militias and terrorists. Stockpiling, price inflation or deflation, and unsustainable off-take may all occur without any way of outsiders knowing. Consumers of ivory are largely unaware that ivory must come from dead elephants, or that many populations are threatened with elimination by their demand.\nDespite what Stiles claims, factors affecting demand for ivory have been studied. In an econometric analysis of Japanese demand prior to the 1989 ban , E.J. Milner-Gulland showed that rising average income, and thus ability to pay, was the key factor. This conclusion offers a compelling parallel with the rising incomes and demand in China today. In addition, the attitudes of both middlemen and consumers are very likely to be affected by signals of possible changes in the supply of ivory: the possibility of one-off stockpile sales or of the eventual opening of a legal market in 25 years’ time are both positive signals to traders and consumers that ivory is still (at least potentially) for sale, as are public destructions of ivory that it is not. Specific surges or drops in demand may therefore be difficult to attribute directly to the events themselves because they may have complicated effects on human perceptions. It is clear, however, that positive signals will support interest in ivory, while negative signals and well-targeted campaigns will cause it to drop. Urgent efforts in the latter approach, to reduce and eventually end demand for ivory, are the only sure means for saving elephants from extinction.\n \nNatural Mortality and Problem Animal Control Cannot Sustain a Trade – Professor Phyllis Lee, Stirling University, Scotland and Amboseli Trust for Elephants, Kenya\nStiles makes assumptions about sustaining a 50-60 ton international trade in ivory based on natural mortality, the one-off and individual shooting of so-called problem animals, and culls that are few and far between for ethical and ecological reasons. Our data from Amboseli, a well-protected site in southern Kenya, can provide a baseline for estimates of natural mortality, and these data do not support Stiles’s claim for a sustainable trade based on naturally dying elephants.\nThe average losses owing to natural mortality are only 3.5 percent in a population of ~1000 individuals, so the rate of acquisition of tusks will be incredibly slow. Again, on average in any year, most (53 percent) natural deaths are among calves under two, who lack tusks. Animals prior to reproductive age, also with small tusks, typically make up another 16 percent of deaths. In total, the proportion of non-“harvestable” individuals is more than two-thirds of natural deaths. Individuals in the age classes likely to produce tusks for trade (>30 years of age) represent just over 10 percent of natural deaths. And since elephants clearly do not frequent elephant graveyards when they are ill or injured, finding this small number of naturally occurring tusks in vast roadless areas, for example the Okavango of Botswana or the forested areas of southern Tanzania (where counts of elephants have high error margins), would be logistically challenging and extremely costly (all carcasses detected and then reached by “harvesters”). These figures suggest that the returns on natural or found “ivory” would be unlikely to generate sufficient returns (60-200 tons) to control the international trade in the costly regulated and policed fashion suggested by the proponents of trade. \n \nNarrow View of Supply and Demand Estimates – Dr. Kathleen Gobush, Wildlife Biologist\nThe level of Asian demand for ivory is often set at whatever volume best fits the argument attempting to be made, when in reality it is not known. The model of annual ivory accumulation to which Stiles refers in fact estimated annual ivory accumulation to be as low as 9.5 tons per annum across Africa, depending on the assumptions and population numbers applied, the latter of which have certainly declined in recent years. The found or pick up rate of tusks is one critical parameter that would need careful ground-truthing to accurately predict accumulation, not to mention an assurance that stock leakage or theft issues would not be a problem. From quotas to permits to stock storage to government-issued ivory identification cards, the global community has not demonstrated it can “utilize” elephants without significantly harming them. How many more awkward attempts can the species endure? How many more must it endure?\n \nFuture Elephant Declines Inevitable Given Habitat Loss, Human Population Growth and Human-Elephant Conflict – Dr. Rene Beyers, Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C.\nAlthough Dr. Stiles’s reasoning seems plausible at first sight, his main assumption that legal ivory can be provided in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner to satisfy demand is problematic. Production of ivory is likely to decrease in the future while demand will stay high, or go up, at least under the current circumstances. Regardless of illegal killing, it is probable that elephant populations will decline in most of Africa (southern Africa may be an exception to this, although see above comments by the Lindens about rhinos) because of habitat loss, rapidly increasing human populations in elephant range countries, and increasing human-elephant conflicts. Civil strife may further push elephants toward local extinctions in certain countries, as was the case in many parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Furthermore, elephant reproduction rates are too low to sustain a market of high demand.\nOn the other hand, it is unlikely that demand would decrease if an ivory market persists. On the contrary, in China, which is now the biggest market, increasing purchasing power means that more people will be able to buy ivory. It is a dangerous assumption that (legal) ivory production will keep up with rising demand. This will lead to increased ivory prices and stimulate the illegal circuit. \nSustaining a market of ivory justifies the use of it as a non-essential luxury, art, or investment item and will make it very difficult to fundamentally change consumer attitudes. We should not assume that attitudes in Asia will not change over time. They did for many animal products (e.g. fur) in Europe in the past, and in general, habits and culture in Asia are changing fast. People are often not aware of the dire consequences of their consumption of ivory for both animals and people.\nAt most, putting more legal ivory to the market might bring a temporary relief through its impact on price, but in the long term it is not a solution, and it may worsen the problem.\nI also doubt that a complete leak-proof system of legal ivory trade can be established. Corruption is rife in many ivory-producing countries , and there is no guarantee that this will improve in the future. Many countries in Africa, for example in central Africa, also have little capacity to monitor a controlled trade.\nOn the customer side, it may be difficult to keep strict control on the proposed mechanism of sales. The Chinese government stockpiled ivory to drive up prices with the last one-off sale. Who says that this would not happen in the future, especially if more countries would be able to sell?\n \nSupply is not unlimited – Dr. Shermin de Silva, Fellow, Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (Institute for Advanced Study) and President and founder, Trunks & Leaves\nThe dominant pro-trade position rests on the assertion that ivory bans create scarcity and drive up price, fueling demand by speculators. It follows from this law of supply and demand that the extinction of a species would be perversely desirable since commodities derived from it would then be indefinitely valuable; the serious speculators not only know this quite well but are probably betting on it.\nYet increased prices are also theoretically meant to reduce demand in order to match supply, and it is implicitly expected that supply can be adjusted accordingly in an iterative process. This might hold for manufactured or cultivated products such as alcohol or tobacco, where the supply is under human control. This is not the case with elephants, fish, or any other over-harvested wild species. The supply itself is fundamentally not in our control, only artificial regulation of harvested supply. Neither the demand nor the supply is behaving as classical theory would predict. That is why there can be no margin for error, especially given that we are operating within corrupt systems where regulating markets is near impossible. This pre-existing reality is an obstacle to implementing the ideal world scenario Stiles outlines.\nEven if the three-part plan were somehow achieved with any degree of success, it is far from guaranteed that poaching levels would drop to a negligible “residual” level. Carved ivory prices would remain high, they would still be perceived as investments, there would still be some demand (perhaps even increased demand, since those who would not purchase illegal ivory may choose to purchase ivory perceived as legal), levels of fraud would rise, and very likely poaching would continue or escalate.\nUnder a total ban, the price for any ivory object would be zero. This is because an item cannot be viewed as a symbol of status or a worthy investment if it is illegal to be caught selling it. The burden of distinguishing legal from illegal products is removed from governments as much as consumers. One reason demand persists is that there continues to be this debate offering hope of limited trade. There is less room for corruption or speculation if the product cannot openly be traded in any form.\n \nCorruption and Porous Borders – Dan Bucknell and Charlie Mayhew, Tusk Trust\nDan Stiles sets out three essential outcomes—or criteria—for there to be a legal ivory trade system in place. It would be extremely difficult to meet these criteria within the time frame required, and they’re based on too many assumptions about the scale of demand—which can’t be modeled with any certainty—and whether that could be supplied legally.\nEven if a tightly regulated market could be established—which is highly unlikely given the levels of corruption in Africa and Asia and the porous nature of Africa’s borders—there would also be the added concern that control of “problem” animals could potentially be abused in order to increase supply.\n \nPotential for Legal Ivory Supply Not Robust – Dr. John Hart, Directeur Scientifique et Technique, Fondation Lukuru, Projet Tshuapa-Lomami-Lualaba (TL2), Kinshasa, République Démocratique du Congo\nI question the potential for elephant populations to supply 50-60 tons (or more?) of legal ivory annually (mortality and culls). I see elephant range shrinking and elephant populations dropping very fast. Major elephant populations are being depleted in a matter of a few years (for example, the latest survey from Selous, in Tanzania, has the landscape holding just 13,000 elephants ). I am not so sure the potential for “legal” ivory supply will remain robust. Ultimately (and maybe even soon) human-elephant conflict will be the dominant determinant of elephant killing and elephant range….and guess who is winning!\nIn any case, very little of this legal tonnage (if legal trade is to happen) can now come from DR Congo. We are down, by best guess, to 7,500 elephants total, at most, for the country and still dropping. Many other countries in central and East Africa will follow Congo in watching their elephant populations collapse in a twinkling of the eye. The ivory might not be there for long.\n \nRisks to Asian Elephants – Prof. Vincent Nijman, Anthropology, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, U.K.\nWhile the world focuses on elephant poaching in Africa, horrible though it is, in the debate the fate of the Asian elephant is ignored (it is not mentioned once by Stiles). We may not see photographs of Asian elephants lying slaughtered in the open fields, but of course they do suffer from poaching to supply demand for ivory just as their African brethren.\nMy worry is that opening up the ivory market by allowing (Asian) countries to trade in African elephant ivory will have a very negative effect on Asian elephants. And given that Asian elephants are more rare and are in an even more precarious situation than African elephants, there is less room for error. The Asian elephants happen to live in some of the most corrupt countries in the world, and when African elephant ivory is allowed to be traded throughout Asia, I can easily see a parallel flow emerging of Asian elephant ivory into the now legal ivory trade. I cannot see a way how this can be stopped once the market opens up. Even if the wholesale price of ivory drops significantly following legal sales, as predicted by Stiles, I reckon still enough money can be made from the sale of ivory to make poaching of Asian elephants worthwhile, especially when it becomes easier and less risky to trade Asian elephant ivory.\n \nNo Examples of Sustainable Trade for Large Species – Prof. Andy Dobson, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., U.S.A.\nThe basic fact that Stiles and other proponents of trade in ivory always fail to acknowledge is that the ivory trade has always been deeply corrupt, and there are no examples of sustainable use of wildlife for any species larger than a cow. The economic reasons for this are simple: The population growth rate of anything larger than a cow is always less than the growth rate of the money supply (interest rate at the bank). If you want your finances to grow at a maximum rate, then there is no point conserving big animals. You will make a larger profit if you kill everything you can, sell the ivory, put the money in the bank, and live off the interest. This is exactly what the whaling industry did, essentially what fisheries do, and this underlies the corruption of ivory and undermines the argument that there should be a trade in ivory to save elephants.\n \nIII: SOLUTIONS\nContinuing to Strengthen Campaigns, Enforcement, and Judicial Systems – Dan Bucknell and Charlie Mayhew, Tusk Trust\nThis debate is set to continue, and yet all those involved want to see elephant populations thrive. With that in mind, we need to focus on what else we can agree on and take it from there:\n1)    That awareness campaigns are required to reduce demand for ivory, whether illegal or legal.\n2)    That there must be much greater penalties imposed, and better enforcement of already existing laws, to prevent elephant poaching and the illegal trade in ivory.\nUntil significant progress has been made in these two areas, the ongoing debate is largely irrelevant.\nTusk Trust is firmly against the re-opening of any legal trade in ivory, as there are too many uncertainties and the risks to elephant populations are far too great.\n \nInter-Generational Legislation – Prof. Andy Dobson, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., U.S.A.\nThe resource extraction industries have always employed scribes to mislead the public about the consequences of their activities. As in the case of global climate change, the legal profession needs to develop inter-generational legislation that allows the estates and descendants of exploitative industries and their day-rate hacks to retrospectively pay significant levels of recompense for the environmental damage they cause.\n \nDon’t Allow Naysayers to Thwart Demand Reduction Efforts – Peter Knights, WildAID\nI do agree with Dr. Stiles that post-1989 the opportunity to end ivory trade was missed, but the thing that then prevented CITES closing the loopholes of stockpiles and legal sales of ivory through which poached ivory flows is exactly what he’s doing now: keeping alive the prospect of reopening a “regulated trade,” as he does here.\nJust as with climate change, whatever the evidence, it only takes one or two naysayers to give political cover to avoid the needed action. His economic analysis and misuse of the word “demand” is particularly frustrating. From a demand reduction point of view, his approach is disastrous, sending the wrong message to consumers (“it’s okay to buy ivory”) who don’t know how to tell legal from illegal ivory. You can’t say, ‘Don’t buy,’ on one hand and ‘Go ahead, buy it,’ on the other, without confusing people—but that’s what he proposes.\n \nDemand Reduction Is Working and Need Not Take Decades – Patricia Raxter, International Studies, Old Dominion University, V.A., U.S.A.\nPro-traders assert that the only way to safeguard wild elephants is to satisfy market demand through legal ivory sales. This is based on the faulty assumption that demand reduction programs are not effective in the short term. However strong evidence illustrates that demand reduction programs can play a fundamental role in shifting attitudes of populations, business leaders, and governments in a relatively short period.\nThe Wild Aid Shark Fin campaign is a good example of how quickly consumer behavior can change. In four short years, Wild Aid was able to raise public awareness on shark finning to the point that 99 percent of Chinese surveyed supported a total ban on shark imports . Online retailers banned sales of shark fin, and in 2012 the Chinese government and Hong Kong agreed to stop serving shark fin soup at official banquets. By 2014, sales had dropped between 50 and 70 percent, significantly decreasing the impact of a thousand-year-old tradition.\nSimilar impacts are possible in the ivory trade. Wild Aid reaches a billion Chinese a week with their ivory demand reduction message, “When the buying stops, the killing can, too.” The International Fund for Animal Welfare’s (IFAW) “ Mom, I got teeth” campaign , which depicts a baby elephant telling his mother about his tusks, was seen by 75 percent of urban Chinese. The ad was also incorporated into official college entrance exams in Zhejiang, reaching a key audience : youth.\nStrong evidence suggests that Chinese attitudes about ivory are quickly shifting as a result of these and other campaigns. After seeing these types of messages, 68 percent of respondents said they would never buy ivory again. In another survey 94 percent of respondents indicated support for a ban on ivory sales to save elephants. Online news articles on the ivory trade, and China’s role, have gone viral in China, reaching millions. Top Chinese business leaders have publicly pledged to never purchase, own, or gift ivory. It took less than six months for local NGOs to successfully lobby Hong Kong leaders to burn the city’s 30-ton ivory stockpile and to convince the city’s three largest ivory retailers to stop selling ivory.\nImportantly, these shifts are part of a greater trend toward environmental awareness in China. After witnessing the environmental impacts of development, about 64 percent of Chinese identify themselves as environmentalists , a rate double that of the U.S. or Europe. More than 5,300 local environmental NGOs exist. Of the country’s 180,000 protests each year, the majority are related to environmental issues. And most hopeful of all, environmental education is now mandated for China’s 200 million school-age children.\nAnd the Chinese government, while it could and should do more, is taking real action. In 2012, China banned auctions of parts and products made from endangered wildlife, including elephants. This year, China made it illegal to knowingly purchase or consume poached wildlife. In January, the government burned six tons of illegal ivory. Beijing has stepped up aid to African governments battling poachers and increased efforts to educate Chinese migrant workers in Africa. It has increased enforcement efforts, making more arrests in China while also participating in successful international operations to crack down on the illegal wildlife trade.\nConsidering that 80 percent of the world’s wildlife crime is trafficked to or through China, demand reduction is about more than “just” elephants and other iconic species. In addition to the well-known threats to tigers, rhinos, and lions, pangolins, turtles, abalone, migratory birds, and countless other animals and plants are subject to the growing Chinese appetite for wildlife. Transnational criminal syndicates can quickly spot trends in consumption, corner the market in a wildlife product, and decimate species.\nCoordinated demand reduction strategies, aggressively marketed, with locally relevant messaging and the support of governments and business, can work to make an immediate difference in the purchasing habits of consumers and can relieve pressure on species on the brink of extinction.\n \nPhotographic Tourism Continues to Grow – Dr. Katarzyna Nowak, Anthropology, Durham University, UK; Zoology & Entomology, University of the Free State, Qwaqwa, RSA; contributor, Conservation Action Trust; Scientific Advisor, Southern Tanzania Elephant Project, Tanzania\nTourism is a booming industry, and although it’s not free of controversy or adverse effects, why isn’t it considered a form of trade deserving of investment? Investment in the form of wild species conservation, equitable sharing of tourism revenue in a way that helps empower local communities, and support of human-elephant conflict mitigation efforts and projects—the core focus of many NGOs and the focus of more than a quarter of projects funded by the USFWS in recent years—a more long-term “problem animal” management strategy than shoot-to-kill, stockpile parts, and trade. Pro-traders urge us to instead invest in niche markets in order to save the same species that attract millions of dollars every year with opportunities for photographic tourism, a lower-risk and far larger market by comparison.\nElephants in Amboseli, Kenya, generate more tourism dollars every year than would be generated by a one-off sale of all their ivory. Numbers of tourists to Africa from China and the Far East are increasing , all of which emphasizes that the tourism sector is not only sustainable but also a growing source of economic revenue for Africa that is much less susceptible to corruption and over-exploitation.\nIn retrospect, the same pro-traders who promoted one-off sales now say they were poorly designed and facilitated the formation of cartels. How would China manage a more regular supply differently, and where would this supply be sourced? From the same diminished stockpiles that have been leaking onto its black market for years, and from declining elephant populations with hardly any natural mortality? How realistic is it to expect demand countries to acknowledge that the supply is finite? When will the pro-trade lobby acknowledge that “price” manipulation isn’t the golden ticket?\nThe two sides of the ivory and broader wildlife trade debate could stop reprocessing their positions and opt for a new, more ethical way forward rooted in our shared hominin history and experience seeing hundreds of species decline from our over-exploitation and anthropocentrism . We increasingly know the limits of our ecological interventions and technical ability to manipulate the natural world; it is beyond time to apply the precautionary principle to trade in elephants and ivory.\n \nFINALE\nThe “Great Work” of Africa Is its Grand Primordial Landscapes and Majestic Herds That Remain – Dr. Rutledge S. Boyes, National Geographic Emerging Explorer / TED Fellow / INK Fellow; Research Associate at Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology; Scientific Director & Trustee, Wild Bird Trust\nThe legalization of the ivory trade is beyond justification. Pro-trade arguments are rooted in the misguided application of economic theory to marketplaces we don’t understand and are too dynamic to control. In Africa there is growing support for legalization owing to the dire situation of what I call desperate, under-resourced “balance sheet conservationists.”\nPro-trade lobbyists use justifications like the protection of cultural heritage, driving down raw ivory prices to suppress poaching and market speculation, and supplying market demand with ivory from stockpiles, culled elephants, natural death, and problem animals. Clean and simple…Let me get this right: Ivory traders buy the ivory for less from government and charge the consumer the same amount to control market demand? Maybe I’m not getting this right? Ok. Ivory traders buy it for less and sell it for less, but the consumer market does not react? Are some people born wanting ivory products, and others will never want them? How do we know how many people will want legal ivory products in five years or even next year?\nSurely to control consumer demand, we need to make ivory unattainably expensive? Or do ivory traders already restrict growth in demand because carved products are already so expensive? So, let me get this right: Ivory traders are assured of making more money from a guaranteed legal supply. How do we know that killing or culling up to 15,000 elephants every year to supply 50-65 tons of legal raw ivory to China, Japan, and Southeast Asia will satisfy demand? Suddenly human-wildlife conflict becomes a profitable business.\nBalance sheet conservationists are the men and women at the coal face of the conservation of protected areas across Africa. They are forever looking for the necessary funds to protect our last wild landscapes from poaching, land invasion, rebels, corruption, pollution, tourism impacts, fire, logging, and habitat degradation. They work tirelessly at grant applications and plead with local governments for subsidies and budget increases.\nSelling ivory and rhino horn stockpiles worth tens of millions of dollars becomes very tempting, making justifications for legalization more and more attractive. This money could fund anti-poaching units, fences, drones, motion sensors, community-based conservation projects, elephant and rhino sanctuaries, awareness campaigns, films… everything we dreamed we would need to stop this killing. As the clock ticks, more and more elephants are shot dead. Panic.\nThis, however, is like catching swordfish to fund swordfish conservation, or selling Cape parrots to save Cape parrots. Society and government need to support these hard-working conservationists, allowing them to focus on their life’s work—creating beautiful, balanced, and secure protected areas. Let’s aim rather at getting millions of Chinese to travel to Africa to enjoy our unrivaled natural heritage to pay for conservation and fill those empty balance sheets.\nThe “Great Work” of Africa, of the peoples of Africa, is the grand primordial landscapes that remain—places like the Serengeti, Okavango, and Congo. Our majestic elephant herds, vast migrations, prides of lion, gentle gorillas, and screaming chimpanzees are at the heart of it. This is what makes us proud to be Africans, and the world envious of what we have. There are better ways of funding conservation than selling ivory.\n \n Download a pdf of this post:  24 Experts Oppose Legalized Ivory Trade\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nIn the Illegal Ivory Trade ...

Monitoring A Grim Rise In the Illegal Ivory Trade  by Christina M. Russo: Yale Environment 360\nMonitoring a Grim Rise\nIn the Illegal Ivory Trade\nFor two decades, TRAFFIC’s Tom Milliken has tracked the illicit ivory trade that has led to the continued slaughter of Africa’s elephants. In an interview with Yale Environment 360 , Milliken talks about the recent increase in ivory seizures and the criminal gangs that supply Asia’s black market for ivory.\nby christina m. russo\nLast year was the worst year for ivory seizures since an international ivory ban went into effect in 1989. During 2011, authorities seized more than 23 tons of ivory, which represented about 2,500 individual elephants killed.\nTom Milliken\nAt the forefront of efforts to track this grim data is Tom Milliken, the elephant expert for TRAFFIC , the group that monitors the international trade in wildlife under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). In that role, the U.S.-born Milliken tracks and analyzes data related to the ivory trade and attempts to raise awareness of the importance of preserving one of Africa’s most iconic species.\nMilliken, who has lived in Africa since 1991, attributes the latest spike in ivory seizures to a seemingly insatiable demand for ivory in Asia and the increasingly sophisticated network of criminal gangs that are feeding the market.\nIn an interview with Yale Environment 360 contributor Christina Russo , Milliken talked about the factors leading to the continued slaughter of elephants and about the lack of strong law enforcement against ivory traffickers. “The fact that nobody is ever arrested, and there are no prison sentences,” he said of cases where ivory is seized, “just sends them right back into the bush to accumulate more ivory faster because they want to make up for what they just lost.”\nYale Environment 360: Last year was arguably the worst for large-scale elephant seizures since the ivory ban in 1989, with the seizure of more than 23 tons of elephant tusks. Did you see this crisis coming?\nTom Milliken: In one sense, yes. I’ve been running a database, the Elephant Trade Information System [ETIS] for CITES, as the monitoring system for illegal trade. And in every analysis that we’ve done since 2004, illegal trade in ivory has been escalating. The last time we did a major assessment, in 2009, it was escalating at a rate faster and greater than we had seen previously... And there’s nothing that has occurred over the last two years that gives me any hope that things are getting better.\nLooking at large-scale ivory seizures in 2011, it’s going off the charts. There were just 13 seizures that generated over 23 tons of ivory. Now, by the time I work in another 800 or 900 seizure cases from the year, it is very likely to show a huge uptick, and that is what I’m really concerned about.\ne360: Do more seizures directly equal more poaching?\nMilliken: No, not necessarily. Because ivory is not a perishable commodity, it can be stored for a long, long time. And sometimes the seizures that are being made don’t represent recently killed elephants, but a\nThe value and price of ivory is up because China is paying more for ivory than other countries were.”\nstockpile that has been under lock and key. In many African countries, corruption is certainly an element in this trade; In any number of countries, government stocks of ivory suddenly go missing and end up in trade. Thailand has seized tons of ivory in the last few years. But I have been told by government officials that at least 100 tusks that were in the possession of customs have gone missing, which probably means it was sold on to the market and back in trade.\ne360: How much is ivory worth on the black market right now?\nMilliken: Well, it’s a question I can’t really answer. Researchers are told stuff, but we are not able to validate it in a real way because nobody is making purchases. But I think the value and price of ivory is up because China is paying more for ivory than other countries were.\ne360: How are seizures typically discovered by customs officials? What tips them off?\nMilliken: Sometimes there’s intelligence. Sometimes somebody is disgruntled, and they make an anonymous phone call. In China, they have\nPhoto courtesy of TRAFFIC\nA TRAFFIC program officer inspects seized ivory in Malaysia.\nstarted targeting certain flights, targeting certain types of cargo that are coming into ports in containers for scanning and enhanced law-enforcement evaluation. In Kenya, where we are seeing an uptick in ivory seizures, they have started using sniffer dogs at Nairobi International airport.\nWe at TRAFFIC have done hundreds of training events all over the world in various languages in the last ten years to sensitize people to ivory trade. I think sometimes this pays dividends. Malaysia, for example, had not made a single ivory seizure since about 2004, if I’m not mistaken. We did a training exercise there last year, and within months, they started seizing and made four or five dramatic seizures of ivory .\ne360: Most of these large seizures fail to result in arrests...\nMilliken: That’s right...\ne360: What does it tell you about law enforcement and the justice system associated with these crimes?\nMilliken: Well, first of all, I think these large-scale ivory seizures [involve] organized crime. These large-scale [operations] require an awful lot of money and organized planning to be able to connect producers with induced markets... So it’s not surprising that people aren’t arrested, in a sense, because in container shipping you get layers and layers of people between you and the shipment.\nObviously these criminal syndicates lose an awful lot of money because their cargo has been interdicted. But the fact that nobody is ever arrested — and there are no prison sentences — just sends them right back into the bush to accumulate more ivory faster because they want to make up for what they just lost.\ne360: Where is most of the poaching occurring?\nMilliken: It is Central Africa. One credible source says there are only five\nAfter a decade and a half or more of civil unrest… so many areas have been denuded of their elephants.”\nplaces left in the entire Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] that have more than 500 elephants. This is a huge shock because 15 to 20 years ago people were talking about 100,000 elephants just in the DRC. After a decade and a half or more of civil unrest, there is just a constant attrition of so many national parks and so many other areas have been denuded of their elephants.\ne360: Why is ivory so desired in China?\nMilliken: Ivory, historically, was a substance from which Chinese artisans would produce magnificent sculptures. But these offerings were only available to the imperial court and the aristocracy in different Chinese dynasties, and perhaps exceedingly wealthy business people. Now, with the phenomenal economic growth that China has experienced, you have more disposable income, more wealth distributed through the population than ever before. So even middle-class people are able to own pieces of ivory. And ivory confers status.\ne360: So if you apply the “follow the money” adage to the ivory trade, who exactly is benefiting most?\nMilliken: I think the greatest profits are always those middlemen who are bridging Africa and Asia — those syndicate traders who are moving the large consignments. They usually have a ready buyer as soon as they can get it to the end-use locations, so they are able to very quickly turn a profit and not hold onto the stuff. The people who get the least amount of money are probably the poachers, who risk a lot — sometimes their lives — to operate in protected areas in Africa.\ne360: Can you describe the profile of the current day poacher? Raoul du Toit , who is working to save rhinos in Zimbabwe, says that poachers are actually quite sophisticated and employ infrared eyewear, automatic weaponry, helicopters...\nTRAFFIC/Martin Harvey/WWF-Canon\nElephants at a water hole in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nMilliken: Yes, that is very true. Particularly the “white guy” poachers in South Africa are exceedingly high-tech. The other end of the spectrum are indigent pygmies in Central Africa, where someone gives them a gun and says, “If you come back with ivory tusks, I’ll buy a bag of mealie meal for your family and maybe some clothes for your children.” So this guy goes off, hunts elephants, and hands over the gun and the tusks, and basically gets food. So poaching occurs at a lot of different scales.\ne360: What is the process by which an elephant is poached? And since elephants stay close together, are whole families poached at once?\nMilliken: The most recent information I’ve been getting is that there are instances now where entire groups of elephants have been found killed with their tusks missing. And this is of course reminiscent of what we saw in the build-up to the CITES trade ban in the 1980s.\nWe have seen evidence here in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in the region where poison has been used to try to kill elephant groups. Temic [a type of a pesticide] has been put in oranges and put in places where elephants are known to come. Sometimes even waterholes have been poisoned. And once elephants are killed, whether by poison or by gunshots, then usually the poachers have a machete, the tusk is hacked out, and then they carry that away very quickly, leaving the scene of the crime.\ne360: Can you explain how conflict and war in Africa affects elephant survival?\nMilliken: Well you get both spectrums. Sometimes elephants become the basic food for soldiers in the bush. Uganda almost lost all of their elephants when the Tanzanian army went in to overthrow the Milton Obote regime\nThe whole infrastructure of a park can be lost. Law enforcement capabilities and everything can be turned upside down.”\nafter Idi Amin. And on their way out, they went back to Tanzania through the national parks of Uganda and pretty much just decimated the herds there and took the ivory home... The whole infrastructure of a park can be lost. The law enforcement capabilities and everything can be turned upside down. And people, researchers and elephant conservationists, have to move out or risk being killed. And generally they move out.\nOn the other hand we have seen where sometimes in conflict you get these “no-man’s lands” where both sides of a conflict are afraid to go... and you end up with these large swaths of land that are essentially unmolested for a long period of time. Suddenly, when peace comes, you go back in there and you’re surprised by the wildlife that you find.\ne360: One country that is dealing with a dramatic loss of elephant numbers is Chad. If I’ve read the numbers correctly, there were 40,000 twenty years ago. Now there are only 2,000.\nMilliken: Yes, the Chad situation is so difficult because it is part of the Darfur conflict. Traditionally, [militia members] will seasonally go on these long 1,000-kilometer trips through Central Africa, kill elephants, kill rhinos, dry the meat, load up camels, and take the dried meat home. Whole communities just nomadically moving through the landscape and taking elephants and robbing people... And they can outgun the people on the ground trying to protect elephants and are able to come in and just sort of own an area for a while. That is the Chad story.\ne360: Which governments in Africa are most committed to protecting and conserving elephants?\nMilliken: Eastern and Southern Africa — the savanna areas — is where your wildlife tourism occurs.\ne360: Kenya, Tanzania...\nMilliken: Yes. And Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, even countries like Zambia. They realize some economic benefit from having wildlife and having tourists come to see that wildlife. These countries are generally performing better and are more interested in protecting elephants.\ne360: Are Asian elephants, and the problems they face, often overlooked?\nMilliken: Well the problems in Asia are different than Africa. A big difference is that with Asian elephants, only the males really have ivory. Females have little tiny tushes but they are not really commercially valuable. So that is number one: Your yield of ivory is very, very different.\nAnd because of selective hunting in the ivory trade through millennia, you have a very high instance of tusklessness amongst Asian male elephants. This is obviously an adaptive survival [characteristic]. The net result is that there is very little ivory yield from Asian elephants.\nBut the second major difference is that human population densities are so much greater than anything we see here in most parts of Africa. Countries like\nI think that for many Africans, in a very personal way, the animal is a totem for their family lineage.”\nIndia, China, and Vietnam — a country that has 87 million people now — it’s not surprising they have only 150 elephants left. Most elephants are in small pockets... And these islands of elephants are increasingly surrounded and cut off by human development and human population. Most elephant killing is not for ivory; it’s for conflict. It’s elephants in your fields, or elephants threatening your children on the way to school.\ne360: Can you paint a broad stroke of the African people and what the general tone there is on elephant poaching?\nMilliken: To be very frank and honest, your average African is more concerned about health, education and welfare — basic survival needs. Because we live on a continent that has some of the poorest people in the world. But Africans are a very tolerant people and they have co-existed with wildlife at densities that have been lost on almost every other continent. So I think that within the African character, there is this basic recognition of the value of nature around them.\nAs Africa develops and people want more roads, more development, and everything that we want, of course there is greater conflict with elephants. But I do think that Africa, definitely the political leadership, regards elephants as a bit of a flagship for the continent, like lions. These are the emblematic creatures that everyone associates with Africa. And I think that for many Africans, in a very personal way, the animal is a totem for their family lineage and for their tribes. And I think that links people to wildlife in a very tangible way.\ne360: Twenty years ago, after the invory ban went into effect, did you really imagine things would get worse, rather than better?\nMilliken: I came to Africa just at the end of the worst elephant carnage that Africa had seen since the turn of the century. The big-game hunting had all stopped by the later part of the 19th Century... But after World War II it started again. And really from the mid-70s through the ‘80s, that was the heyday of the ivory trade.\nBut what I’m seeing now, the big change is how many Asians are living in Africa and are part of the African landscape. When I came here in ‘91,\nThailand is running the world’s largest unregulated ivory market with impunity.”\na capital city in Africa would have a single Chinese restaurant. Some places wouldn’t have any. Now a capital city probably has 25 Chinese restaurants. I think that is emblematic of how many Chinese, and how many Asians, are here in Africa. And as a result of that, you now have people who are able to rapidly connect the end-use market with the supply at the source, and that is the principal reason we are seeing this escalation.\nThese syndicates I talk about, this organized crime, this is Asian-run/African-based organized crime. And this is a phenomenon we haven’t witnessed before in the history of Africa. You have seen your European and Middle Eastern entrepreneurs set up and trade ivory at different times in the history of Africa. But this is the first time, in a wholesale way, where you have Asian traders who are highly organized, who are in almost every country where you find elephants, who are actively involved in the procurement of ivory and its shipment to Asian destinations.\ne360: In your mind, do you have an optimal plan to save this species?\nMilliken: Well, for almost every elephant that is killed in Africa its ivory is ending up in one of two places: China or Thailand. China, I think, is engaged. China is seizing ivory and doing lots of good things — but they have to do a lot more. And they definitely need to be aggressively involved on the African continent with their citizens here, promoting a zero tolerance of involvement in ivory trade and other endangered species trade.\nI think they need to complement that by making law-enforcement officers available to African colleagues, so that when Chinese nationals are arrested here in Africa with ivory, the interrogation and the review of cell phones and computer documents and correspondence can be done by law-enforcement professionals who live and work in the Chinese language... I think so much intelligence information is lost because no one in Africa has the ability to understand what it is they have just seized.\nChina also needs to get very active in funding... China is a hugely wealthy country now. They are putting lots of development money into Africa, but almost nothing into wildlife conservation and building capacity for wildlife professionals.\nMORE FROM YALE e360\nREAD MORE\nWith Thailand, the government is dragging its feet. The government may seize something before it comes into the country, but the name of the game in Thailand is: Get the ivory into the country and then our government won’t ever touch it...

Thailand is running the world’s largest unregulated ivory market with impunity.\nI think the CITES parties and the U.S. government could call out Thailand and say, “Look, CITES is very specific about what needs to be in place if you’re allowing domestic trade in ivory. And Thailand doesn’t meet any of the criteria.”...\nHonestly, it’s been going on for years, and the toll of dead elephants just keeps mounting.

Elephants Cannot Survive Ivory Ban; ... which led to an ... when they expect to make a killing as increasing tusk scarcity continues ... Elephants Cannot Survive Ivory Ban - Elephant Protection Elephants Cannot Survive Ivory Ban\nElephants Cannot Survive Ivory Ban\nCan Elephants Survive a Continued Ivory Trade Ban?\nOriginally published at NationalGeographic.com on September 15, 2014\nCorruption, speculation and the high price of ivory make the ivory ban unworkable.\nBy Daniel Stiles\nPART ONE: Here I respond to  Christina Russo ’s in-depth examination, published in National Geographic News, of one of the more incendiary questions discussed in wildlife conservation circles: Should there be a legal trade in elephant ivory? I discuss some inaccuracies and misconceptions commonly held by ivory trade ban proponents that were quoted in Russo’s article. Following (PART TWO), I lay out for the first time elements that would be included in a legal trade. The outcome, I believe, will be a significant reduction of elephant killing for ivory.  \nI live much of the time in a grass-thatched cottage on a wildlife conservancy in Kenya. I have a view of Mount Kenya out front and the Abedares in back. Just off my large compound is a clearing in the bush that used to be a water reservoir, before the earth dam broke. Now dry, except for a small stream that runs through it, the grass, water, and minerals in the patches of bare soil attract almost daily visits from elephants, white and black rhinos, and all manner of other wildlife.\nWhen I watch the elephant families frolic in the clearing, and see their tusks, I find it hard to imagine that anyone could be so cold-blooded as to kill these magnificent creatures for what are simply long teeth. The elephants use them to good effect as they dig out a wallow in the deeply incised stream.\n \nPhotograph by Daniel Stiles.\nTusks are useful to elephants—they’re not adornment—used among other things to dig out a wallow in a stream bed. Photograph by Daniel Stiles.\n \nI care a lot about elephants. It makes me extremely angry that people kill them for their ivory. But it also frustrates me when I see apparently well-meaning campaigns aimed at policies and actions that will only increase elephant poaching for ivory.\nI am convinced that attempts to completely restrict all ivory sales, both domestic and international, and the campaign to destroy all ivory stockpiles—even the historical collection kept by the British royal family—are backfiring tragically on elephants. Already these restrictions have resulted in skyrocketing ivory prices, which along with other factors has spurred an elephant-killing spree. Sadly, as long as these factors remain in place, this will continue.\nWhat Does Empirical Evidence Say?\nI believe in empirical evidence to test policies and actions. The policy to test since 1990 is the ban on the international trade in ivory.\nElephant poaching  did decrease in some places after the ban, but it carried on as usual in others, and in parts of Southeast Asia it actually increased, with Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar losing two-thirds of their elephant populations in the decade after the ban.  \nIn the early years after the ban,  ivory market activity  and raw ivory prices dropped almost everywhere data are available. It appeared that the ban was initially successful in reducing illegal ivory trading. I thought myself that this was the case until I analyzed what had actually occurred leading up to and following the 1990 ban implementation.\nHong Kong and Japan in the 1980s were the biggest importers and manufacturers of raw ivory. They were probably also the biggest buyers of poached tusks. As calls for more controls on ivory trade escalated in the 1980s, and CITES imposed a quota system on raw ivory exports, elephant poaching increased. With increased poaching, calls began for a total ban on ivory trade from Africa, which could be achieved by listing the African elephant on CITES Appendix I.\nNo one, to my knowledge, has ever truly determined the drivers of the increased poaching. Not enough research was conducted on ivory markets in the 1980s to be certain, but reports of huge raw ivory stockpiles  in Hong Kong in 1989 (665 tons) and Japan (unquantified, but in the 1980s more than 2,500 tons were imported) lead to one conclusion: They were stockpiling. Why? Because a future supply of ivory was uncertain, and increasingly it looked like a ban was on the way.\nIf high consumer demand had been the cause of the increased poaching, the stockpiles would not have existed. The raw ivory would have been processed.\nTragically, the rising calls for an ivory trade ban increased poaching because East Asian dealers and factories decided to stockpile for future use. The two fed each other in a positive feedback loop—increased poaching, increased calls for control, leading to more poaching to stockpile, ad infinitum until the ban.\nAfter the CITES ban, demand fell in the West owing to all the negative publicity related to buying ivory that accompanied the run-up to the ban. East Asia’s largest ivory export market withered. East Asia was left with huge ivory stockpiles and falling demand. Prices fell, ivory market activity slumped. The ban seemed to be working.\nLack of Foresight\nThe period 1990-92 was critical for planning for future predictable occurrences. One: As the stockpiles dwindled, East Asian ivory factories would eventually begin looking for new raw ivory. Two: By 1990, the economic reforms made by China’s “paramount leader” Deng Xiaoping were well apparent. China would become an important part of the ivory demand equation. Three: With the trade ban in place, the ivory could only be obtained from poaching.\n \nBy 1990 it was apparent that China would become an important part of the ivory demand equation because of economic growth and liberalization. The vertical red line indicates the start of the ivory trade ban.

Esmond Martin and I carried out a series of ivory investigations in Africa and Asia between 1999 and 2003.  We noted , “… in parts of Central and West Africa there appears to have been a slow revival since the mid-1990s.” In South East Asia  we found , in part, “Unfortunately, it appears that demand for ivory has remained steady or increased in some places in Asia since the mid-1990s, stimulating elephant poaching.” \nHowever, after the CITES-authorized 1999 sales from southern Africa to Japan, the ivory market decline continued in China, Taiwan, and Japan. All the indicators—ivory prices, numbers of factories, craftsmen, outlets, etc.—had dropped from pre-1989 levels.\n“These statistics illustrate very well indeed that the ivory industry of Japan since the late 1980s has experienced a massive decline,” and “probably the most surprising finding of this survey was the unexpectedly small size of the local market in China,” said Martin and Stiles in 2003:  The Ivory Markets of East Asia  report.\nIn spite of hard evidence to the contrary, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) continues to claim that the 1999 sale stimulated demand and “substantially compromised its [the ban’s] integrity, effectiveness, and enforceability,” according to Allan Thornton in  Russo’s essay .\nEsmond Martin and I could find no signs of this.  We wrote: “Ivory industry business personnel in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan did not believe that the 1999 southern African ivory auctions had a significant effect on either internal or external ivory demand.”\n \nIn 2002 half-empty shelves showed that the ivory industry was moribund in China, but there was still ivory being manufactured 12 years after the ban from newly poached tusks. The 1999 CITES-approved sale to Japan had changed nothing. Photograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nIf CITES Parties and conservationists had seized the opportunity to establish a well-designed legal raw ivory trade regime in the early 1990s when demand was low, the poaching rise we have witnessed over the past 20 years could have been avoided.\nThe Real Cause of Rising Demand in China\nThe credo of the ivory ban proponents has been that the 2008 CITES-approved ivory sale to Japan and China was the cause of the spike in consumer demand, which set off the current elephant poaching crisis. The insinuation was that a regular legal ivory trade would be even more disastrous.\nEsmond Martin and Lucy Vigne assessed Japan’s ivory market in late 2009 and  concluded that “The golden days of ivory carving in Japan have ended.” The market had continued its precipitous downward spiral seen in 2002. There were fewer carvers, outlets, and items seen for sale.\nThese findings did not prevent EIA’s Allan Thornton proclaiming falsely in Russo’s article that “Japan is back in the ivory business,” implying it had been reinvigorated because of the 2008 sales.\nHowever, consumer demand for ivory did rise in China, beginning in about 2004 and surging in 2006. It took a Chinese student researcher from Yale University to discover what prompted the rise in ivory interest in China. Yufang Gao spent two days visiting with me in Kenya and  explaining his ideas , which I found original and stimulating.\nGao  was not satisfied with the common explanation that the rise in ivory demand was driven by the CITES approved one-off sale in 2008. He learned that in 2002 the Chinese government started to put traditional culture preservation on the agenda, and in 2005 the government launched a number of initiatives in association with UNESCO’s Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.\nIn 2006 ivory carving was designated as a national intangible cultural heritage. This State recognition enhanced the cultural value of ivory carving, raising its value in the eyes of consumers.\nFrom 2002 to 2006 the Chinese government promoted ivory carving as an intangible cultural heritage, which raised its value and desirability in the eyes of the public.\nPhotograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nThe second and the most important driver of worked ivory demand was a boom in arts investment, especially after the  global economic crisis  that began in 2007. As real estate and stock markets tumbled, a large amount of capital from individuals and professional investment companies started to enter the art market. Along with ancient Chinese paintings, jades, and porcelains, carved ivory was touted as a profitable investment. Media coverage about the astronomical prices of auctioned ivory greatly boosted the perceived economic value of ivory products, new or old, which led to an explosion of ivory demand.\nIvory art for investment took off in 2009 and peaked at the end of 2011, mirroring elephant poaching data  produced by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) program.\n \nBetween 2009 and 2011 wealthy Chinese consumers flocked to buy ivory artworks as an investment, stimulating demand. Photograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nIt was these cultural and investment factors, and not the 2008 one-off ivory sale, which stimulated consumer interest in worked ivory in China.\n“The 2008 CITES one-off sale stimulating demand in China is a myth created by Westerners,” Gao told me.\nConsumer Demand Falls—Elephant Poaching Rates Go Up?\nRecent information suggests that consumer demand has been falling since 2012, supported by research carried out in China by Kirsten Conrad and Brendan Moyle in  2013  and  2014 . “The factories are actually using up tusks slower than the total allocations (13.78 tons out of 18). If demand had taken off in the way many are claiming, then we’d expect to see these numbers trending up to match,”  said Brendan Moyle . Some factories were even selling raw ivory because they didn’t need it.\nIf the investment craze for carved ivory was tapering off, why was elephant poaching still going full speed ahead?\n \nIvory factories in China did not even use all of the tusks they were allocated by the government. Moyle found that the 2012-13 weight of raw ivory processed fell by more than 50 percent from 2011-12 (the production cycle is July-July), indicating a drop in consumer demand. Photograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nIt was not only Chinese consumer interest in carved ivory that sparked the poaching crisis beginning in 2008-09. Investors, a.k.a. speculators, also became interested in raw ivory—tusks. After anti-trade NGOs succeeded in forcing a  nine-year moratorium on proposals  for future legal ivory sales from southern Africa at the CITES Conference of the Parties in 2007, unscrupulous ivory dealers saw that there was even more money to be made from poached tusks, because uncertainty of supply fuels speculation.\nCITES, thanks to anti-trade NGOs, had provided traffickers with a windfall. Just as China ivory factories thought that they would be receiving a continued supply of legal tusks through repeated CITES-approved sales,  their hopes were dashed . \nWe are now back to a situation somewhat like the 1980s, where East Asian dealers and factories are buying all of the poached ivory they can. The positive feedback loop, with calls for more restrictions leading to more stockpiling and more poaching are once again feeding one another. But instead of Hong Kong and Japan, now it’s China that is buying most of the poached ivory. And instead of stockpiling ivory for future use, some of the biggest buyers are hoarding tusks for future sale, when they expect to make a killing as increasing tusk scarcity continues to force prices ever higher.\nThe “ Stop Ivory ” campaign, which aims to close all ivory markets and destroy all stockpiles, is creating a perception of ivory scarcity. The well-publicized new round of ivory stockpile destructions beginning in Kenya in 2011 and running up to the present in the Philippines, the USA, China, Hong Kong, and other places has turned perception into reality. Close to 70 tons of ivory has been destroyed, equaling the legal annual quota in China over 12 years.\nThe Price of Illegal Raw Ivory in China Has Skyrocketed\nMartin and Vigne  went to China in late 2010, and again in May 2014, and found that “The average price paid by craftsmen or factory owners, for good quality, privately-owned 1-4 kg elephant tusks in Beijing in early 2014 was $2,100 per kilogram [$955 per pound]. The average price for similar tusks in 2010 was $750 per kg [$341 per pound].”\nSpeculators are attracted to a 280 percent return on investment in less than four years. If the ivory is purchased in Africa, profits are much higher. Chinese ivory traffickers are flocking to the Zambian countryside, Dar es-Salaam, Kinshasa, and dozens of other places in Africa where tusks can be bought from poachers and middlemen for as little as $50 per kilogram. What speculator can resist buying a commodity at $50 a kilogram and selling it for $2,100 a kilogram? That’s a 4,200 percent profit! In reality, of course, with all of the expenses and an average buying price of about $150 a kilogram, profit might be “only” 1,000 percent.\nThe opportunity for enormous profits has prompted high-level African politicians, military officers, and police commanders to muscle into the trafficking networks. Corruption of the kind described by Liz Bennett in her  recent essay in Conservation Biology  is now common. The corruption is a result of the CITES ivory trade ban and is strengthened by the campaign to “Stop Ivory.”\nWe need to appreciate that the high poaching rates and corrupt ivory trafficking networks described by Bennett were created under an ivory ban regime. The two one-off sales were blips that had little effect, as both the  Elephant Trade Information (ETIS)   and  MIKE  concluded after extensive analysis.  I concluded  the same when analyzing the 1999 one-off sale.\nEven with the downturn in consumer demand for carved ivory in China, the increased speculator demand for raw ivory is driving horrifying rates of elephant poaching.\nTom Milliken, who manages ETIS, was recently  quoted as saying , “Just looking at large-scale ivory seizures, 2013 represents the highest quantity of ivory seized in 25 years of data going back to 1989.” More than 51 metric tons (57 U.S. tons) of ivory were seized in 2013! This is empirical evidence that the CITES ivory ban and stockpile destruction are bad policy.\n \nThe high price of ivory is driving elephant massacres all across Africa. Speculators encourage this because greater scarcity of elephants and ivory means higher prices in future.\n \nWhat Is the Solution?\nEmpirical evidence does not suggest that more of the same would be successful in reducing poaching. I agree with Albert Einstein, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”\nIf China could receive 40-50 tons and Japan 10-15 tons of legal raw ivory annually, the speculators would be put out of business, most ivory factory owners would cease buying poached tusks, raw ivory prices would plummet, and elephant poaching would become much less profitable, greatly reducing the incentive to poach. Uncertainty and speculation would cease.\nThis quantity of ivory could be supplied from a combination of existing African stockpiles, natural elephant mortality and “problem” animal control. Many people are unaware that large numbers of elephants are killed legally every year in human-elephant conflict situations. Not a single elephant life would have to be sacrificed for this legal, regulated trade.\nElephant killing would not cease entirely, because there are other drivers such as human-elephant conflict, meat, and African ivory markets. But even a 50 percent reduction in poaching rates would be worth it.\nIs the goal to stop elephant killing, or stop ivory? I’m for the first one.\nPART TWO: How would a legal trade system work?\nWith a legal raw ivory trade, elephants can thrive.\nThere are measures that can be taken to avoid corruption and laundering of the type described in Elizabeth Bennett’s Conservation Biology  essay. She described the problems associated with the current illegal system and applied them to an assumed legal ivory trade. Her assumptions were faulty.\nThe legal system would need to achieve three essential outcomes: (1) ivory factory owners no longer buy poached tusks, (2) ivory consumer demand is driven down to meet available legal supply, and (3) the current black market ivory factories and outlets in China are either brought into the legal system or put out of business.\nI mention only China in outcome 3 because China is the elephant in the room, so to speak. With 1.4 billion people and an economy that will soon be the largest in the world, coupled with a cultural desire for ivory, the Chinese control the fate of elephants.\nIf these three outcomes can be achieved, all of the concerns about corruption and leakage of illegal ivory into the legal supply chain outlined in Bennett’s essay can be avoided. I will explain why.\n(1) Ivory factory owners, whether they be a State Owned Enterprise (SOE) in China or privately owned, have the same basic objectives—make a profit and stay in business. If a legal business achieves those two objectives better than an illegal one, the rational owner or manager will choose the legal option. So if legal raw ivory can be provided in sufficient quantity at predictable times at an acceptable price, there will be no incentive to buy higher risk illegal ivory.\nIn addition, there are advantages that legal raw ivory in China offers: It is much cheaper than illegal, and legal supply is predictable, while illegal supply because of seizures is not. The only reason an illegal market operates at all is the lack of sufficient legal supply, which is controlled by the government at 5-6 tons a year.\nIf 40-50 tons of legal raw ivory could be supplied a year, all of the currently illegal factories could be drawn into the legal system by the offer of low-risk, high-gain legal ivory. They would not need to buy illegal ivory, eliminating the motivation to launder (i.e. buy illegal and mix with the legal).\nThe reduction in demand for illegal ivory would drive its price down to a level that would become unattractive for most traffickers, which would lower poaching and quash speculative buying and stockpiling. Who would stockpile a commodity whose price is falling?\nCurrently, the Chinese government is selling legal raw ivory at about $600 a kilogram on average to registered ivory factories, according to Moyle and Conrad. Illegal factories are paying an average of $2,100 a kilogram according to Martin and Vigne, and Gao found that secondary raw ivory dealing on the Internet reached prices up to $2,800 a kilogram.\nWhat factory owner in his or her right mind would buy poached tusks at those prices if legal ones were available at $600 a kilogram?\n(2) Consumer demand can be driven down in two ways, one of them already succeeding in China and Japan—price. The main reason consumer demand started falling in 2012 in China is that carved ivory prices reached a limit few consumers were willing to pay. I believe this was intentional in the legal market and coincidentally necessary in the illegal market.\nBecause of the very small quotas of raw ivory rationed to legal factories, they opted to produce low quantity, high quality, high price items—mainly elaborate figurines, carved or polished tusks, and extravagant composite pieces. Only the wealthy could afford to buy them. The huge profit per item compensated for the low volume.\n \nBecause of low legal raw ivory supply, legal ivory factories in China pursue a strategy of producing mostly low volume, highly priced items. Photograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nThe illegal market sector is forced to charge higher prices than in 2010 because the raw ivory they use has gone up in cost so much recently, currently to more than $2,000 a kilogram. Because they have to sell in high volume, they manufacture mostly the smaller, less expensive items such as diminutive, lower quality figurines, jewelry, name seal blanks, chopsticks, and other knick-knacks. They are not able to produce the high quality items the legal sector does because, with a few exceptions perhaps, the master craftsmen work in the legal sector.\nIt is Versace versus Wal-Mart applied to ivory.\nTo drive overall ivory consumption down, the entire ivory market must be shifted more toward the Versace model.\nThis is where the second way to drive consumer demand down comes in—campaigns of the type WildAid, Save the Elephants, African Wildlife Foundation, and others have launched. Create awareness about the harm buying ivory causes to elephants. Target especially jewelry and other items that are seen in public, create stigma associated with wearing or using ivory items, as was done with fur. Combined with high prices, stigma could lower demand considerably for ivory bracelets, necklaces, cigarette holders, and so on produced in the black market.\n3) In a sustained, legal ivory trade system the Chinese government is crucial to achieve the outcome of doing away with the black market. The traditional carrot- and-stick approach can be used to entice the illegal factories to register and join the legal, regulated system. They can be offered a quota of legal ivory annually at relatively low cost. The owner and employees of any unregistered factories found operating after a certain date would suffer severe penalties. Why would a factory owner choose to take the risk of staying in the black market when low-cost, legal ivory was on offer?\nSupply and Demand\nFor the system above to work, it depends on there being enough legal raw ivory available to bring a high proportion of illegal ivory factories on board the legal boat, and being able to satisfy consumer demand reasonably well. A small amount of residual illegal activity is to be expected, but the overall objective of significantly reducing elephant poaching can be achieved.\nA  document  submitted at the 65th CITES Standing Committee meeting in July this year stated that the “current African ivory stockpiles contain at least 800 [metric tons] of ivory… The true figure, however, may be considerably higher than that.” There are many complications involving what quantity would be legal to trade and which countries would meet CITES criteria to enable them to trade, but it is apparent that there’s a lot of ivory sitting in storerooms in Africa that is being wasted. It could be used to save elephant lives.\nKathleen Gobush produced the results of a lengthy study carried out for Save the Elephants last year that included estimates of how much ivory accumulates annually from natural mortality. Her methodology would yield 38 tons annually at a 4 percent natural mortality rate from only 12 African countries, where data were good enough to run her model. If problem animal control (PAC) ivory were added, the quantity would be much larger. She found that 44-67 percent of the legal ivory sold by the four southern African countries in 2008 derived from PAC ivory, and the remainder from natural deaths.\nWhile no exact figure can be put at present on how much ivory would be available from stockpiles, natural mortality and PAC combined, I am confident that a minimum of 60 tons of legal ivory could be exported from Africa annually for at least ten years, without a single poached tusk needed. During this ten-year period, intense demand-reduction campaigns can be mounted so that renewable resource ivory from natural deaths and PAC can supply demand sustainably.\nThe cheaper legal raw ivory should not translate to cheaper worked ivory, however. This could stimulate consumer demand. I would recommend that a “conservation tax” be applied to worked ivory to keep prices up, dampening demand. The revenues could be dedicated to conservation projects in Africa and awareness campaigns in China.\n \nTo prevent cheaper raw ivory translating to cheaper worked ivory, which would raise consumer demand, a conservation tax could be applied to keep prices high. Photograph by Daniel Stiles\n \nPreventing Leakage and Laundering\nLegal ivory stockpile quantities would be reported annually to CITES, as currently required. A country not reporting would not be eligible to sell its ivory. Every eligible country would be subject to periodic independent monitoring of its stockpile in a manner to be determined by CITES.\nCITES would supervise sales annually or semiannually following procedures established for the one-off sales. The significant difference being that now buyers would be confident that they’d know when, where, and how much ivory will be available in future. Uncertainty and speculation will be eliminated.\nThe ivory will be shipped in sealed containers directly from African government storerooms to Asian government receiving points in the purchasing countries for storage and distribution. This will cut out all of the points subject to corruption and laundering mentioned in the Bennett essay.\nIf this type of system can be established, I foresee that many African countries that currently export their ivory illegally, often with government involvement, will see the advantages of cleaning up their act so that they can qualify to enter the legal trade regime. Why take the risk of smuggling illegal ivory that is subject to confiscation when it can be sold legally, risk-free? The advantages will become increasingly apparent as poached ivory prices plummet with legal trade.\n“No Good Reason Why Anyone Needs Ivory”\nI agree completely with Beth Allgood’s sentiments expressed in Russo’s commentary: There’s no good reason why anyone needs ivory. But not everyone feels the way Beth and I do, and we have to face reality. Some people want ivory. I do not see the attempt to ban all ivory succeeding better than allowing the limited, legal raw ivory trade described here. Closing the legal ivory market in China will only drive the master carvers and others into the illegal sector. The black market is already illegal, how much more illegal can it become with a total ban? It will carry on and even expand, fostering crime, corruption, and continued elephant killing.\nElephants cannot survive the continued ivory trade ban and “Stop Ivory.” They can thrive with legal trade.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 8:\n\nWelcome to No Animal Poaching: No Animal Poaching: Home About News > > > > ...

A smaller pair weighing about 40kg is  offered for HK$8.2 million. That is equivalent to a per-kilogram price  of between HK$205,000 and HK$230,770. In 2002, a major report on the ivory trade found that a 78kg pair of  elephant tusks could be bought in Hong Kong for just HK$250,000 - less  than one fiftieth of the price of the smaller pair of tusks on sale at  the mainland-owned Wan Chai store.\nThe sky-high ivory price compares with an average HK$1,220 per  kilogram fetched when 102 tonnes of stockpiled ivory was controversially  sold to China and Japan by four African countries in 2008. That sale -  approved by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered  Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) - was the last legal sale of an ivory  stockpile globally after a worldwide ban was imposed in 1989.\nHong Kong shops need government-issued licences to sell certain types  of ivory, including products carved before the 1989 ban, ivory from the  tusks of extinct mammoths, and ivory bought from government stockpile  sales in southern Africa.\nStaff at branches of Chinese Arts and Crafts said buyers were  snapping up ivory not only for display but as an investment, as its  value was rising at a rate of 20 per cent a year. \"There is no more  ivory, so the price is going up and up,\" said a saleswoman at the  Pacific Place branch of the chain, where a 116cm antique tusk is on sale  for HK$1.9 million.\nGrace Ge Gabriel, Asia regional director for the International Fund  for Animal Welfare, said the legal ivory trade in Hong Kong was  exacerbating the illegal trade in poached and smuggled ivory.\n\"The legal ivory trade not only provides cover for smuggled ivory to  be laundered.

His  organisation, which has branches in Kerala and Mumbai, specialises in  dog training and also offers dogs for security, patrol and drug  detection.\nA resident of Irinjalakuda in Trichur district of Kerala, Wolf is a  graduate in business management and has undergone dog training in  Germany.\nHe said he has been flooded with calls since the Bahrain assignment. “Most calls are from the UAE and other Gulf countries, for handling  cheetahs, tigers and leopards. I am not trained for them. I had handled  dogs before this so it was quite an experience to share a room with a  cheetah.”\nWolf was flown to Bahrain by a royal family member who had rehabilitated a four-year-old cheetah from Ethiopia.\n“It was my first encounter with an adult cheetah. She was locked up in a  room, and seven trainers who came before me had failed to even go near  her,” recalled Wolf.\n“For the first few days, all what I did was unlock the door to the  cheetah’s room, peep my head and then lock the door. I did this hundreds  of times. I wanted to kill the cheetah’s instinct to attack a human  being at first sight. Somehow the plan worked.\n“Gradually the cheetah got familiar with my face and I started spending  more time with her, armed with nothing more than a tin can. Every time  she would rush at me, I would beat the tin can on the floor. The clatter  scared her and she kept away from me. The first step was to teach the  animal to share space with me.\n“Next up was building trust. I would keep some meat lumps in a tray and  stand next to it. Initially, the cheetah would grab them and run away.  So I started tying the meat lumps on the tray handles so that she would  be forced to have her food in front of me.”\nThe trick, Wolf says, was to act neither as the prey nor the predator. “You should not display any flight or fight syndrome because animals  will immediately sense if you are in fear or in combative mood. I  remained listless, and did not even make eye contact with the cheetah  when it was standing next to me,” said Wolf.

The total includes 770  endangered fin whales and 1145 minke whales. Despite Iceland’s only  whaling company having increasing difficulty in finding a market for  whale meat the government has decided to continue to issue annual quotas  for the killing of whales.\nThe quota which will run from next year will see the whaling company  run by  Kristjan Loftsson able to harpoon and kill 229 minke whales each  year and 154 fin whales each year. The market for whale meat in Iceland  is shrinking and new markets are having to be found for the whale meat  including for use as dog food in Japan .\nIn Iceland only 3% of adults have said they regularly eat whale meat  and 75% of residents say they never buy the meat. Younger people (under  25) are increasingly adverse to whale meat with 86% saying they never  buy the meat. Local restaurants who depend on the whale watching tourism  industry have also responded by removing whale from the menu.\nThe whale watching industry is growing in importance to Iceland with  175,000 people visiting the country each year to see the whales. This  year the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), along with Icewhale ,  the Association of Icelandic whale watch operators, launched a Whale  Friendly Restaurants scheme promoting restaurants which pledge not to  serve whale meat. Almost 50% of restaurants in downtown Reykjavik have  so far signed up and display a Whale Friendly logo to tourists.\nRobbie Marsland, UK Director of IFAW, said: “We are deeply  disappointed that such a controversial decision has been made in such a  manner. To sneak the decision out on a Friday evening shortly before  Christmas without any reference to Icelandic and international criticism  of this unnecessary and inhumane trade demonstrates how embarrassing  one stubborn whaler is becoming to Iceland.”\nIceland’s commitment to harpooning and killing whales is diplomatic  problems and also public relations issues. The United States has  threaten the country with diplomatic sanctions if it continues with  commercial whale hunting. Ports in Europe have also taken direct action  against the whalers by refusing to accept cargos that contain whale meat . Both Amsterdam and Hamburg have turn cargo ships away for carrying whale meat due to public pressure.\nSource:  WWF.panda.org\nCaviar should be crossed off Christmas gift lists whenever possible to  give highly endangered sturgeon a chance to recover in the wild.\nSturgeon worldwide are teetering on the brink of extinction because of the persistent trade in their valuable caviar.\nAlthough legal fishing is strictly regulated in most countries, illegal  fishing and trade continue. Caviar is considered a delicacy and is one  of the world’s most expensive wildlife products.\n\"It's about being aware of what you buy, and the impact it can have on  species and on the environment,\" said WWF's Sturgeon Expert, Jutta  Jahrl, “anyone planning to buy a gift of caviar from wild sturgeon – for  example Beluga - should reconsider.”\nAll sturgeon species are protected under the Convention on International  Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). At  present, international trade in wild caviar from shared stocks - like  the Caspian Sea or the Danube - is not allowed.\nAccording to trade statistics, the European Union, the United States and  Switzerland are the largest importers of caviar with 81% of all legal  caviar imports between 1998 and 2006.

In May this year, AfDB and the World Wildlife Fund  launched a joint call (Marrakech Declaration) for action and commitment  from governments and other institutions to combat the illicit wildlife  trafficking across the continent.\nThe Declaration is summed up in a 10-point action plan to combat this  trafficking. Subsequent to that, the board of the bank approved loans to  Cameroon, Chad and the Central African Republic for the financing of  the Central Africa Biodiversity Conservation Programme. At the launch of  this programme, the bank’s president called upon African countries to  collaboratively commit to fight international illegal wildlife  trafficking.\nAfDB was represented by the Resident Representatives of Zambia and  Zimbabwe and by two experts from the Agriculture and Agro-Industry  Department at the Gaborone summit. Some of the bank’s actions against  elephant poaching and other wildlife trafficking operations were  presented, including program to protect elephant in Central Africa, and  the Marrakech Declaration.\nThe bank also presented its 10-year strategy to demonstrate possible  linkages and support through the core priority areas. During discussion  on resource mobilisation, it suggested that innovative financing was an  option to pursue in the face of scarce resources and increasing needs to  fight elephant poaching and the illegal ivory trade.\nThe summit was attended by ministers and delegates from 30 participating  countries, including elephant range states such as Gabon, Kenya,  Uganda, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Niger, Zambia and Ivory Coast; transit  states such as Vietnam, Philippines and Malaysia; and ivory destination  states including China and Thailand.\nIt also featured bilateral and multilateral organisations - German  Society for International Cooperation, United States Agency for  International Development, United Nations Development Programme,  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna  and Flora, European Union and the World Bank.

In September 2012, the African  Development Bank attended the International Union for Conservation of  Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress in Korea that called for a  high-level meeting on African elephants. The Bank considers wildlife  trafficking and elephant poaching as not just an environmental issue.  International criminal networks run the trade, some using the profits to  buy weapons, to finance civil conflicts and to pay for terrorism  undermining Africa potential development and threatening peace and the  rule of law.\nThe Bank was invited to participate in an emergency summit addressing  the problems of the illegal ivory trade on December 2-4 by the  Government of Botswana and the IUCN in Gaborone, Botswana. The Summit  focused on the dynamics of the entire ivory value chain.\nPresident Seretse Khama Ian Khama of Botswana opened the summit, in  the presence of Ministers and delegates from 30 participating countries,  including elephant range states such as Gabon, Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon,  Zimbabwe, Niger, Zambia and Ivory Coast; transit states such as  Vietnam, Philippines and Malaysia; and ivory destination states  including China and Thailand.\nSeveral other bilateral and multilateral organizations (German  Society for International Cooperation, USAID, UNDP, Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,  European Union and the World Bank) attended the summit. The African  Development Bank was represented by the Resident Representatives of  Zambia and Zimbabwe and by two experts from the Agriculture and  Agro-Industry Department.\nThe objectives of the summit were to raise awareness at the highest  political level about the dimensions of the poaching crisis and the  current dynamic of the ivory illegal trade. During the summit, 14 action  measures, to halt and reverse the trend in illegal killing of elephants  and the illegal ivory trade in ivory were discussed for implementation  by the end of 2014. The measures are considered to be urgent (Urgent  Measures) and require commitment from the high-level political  representatives at the African Elephant Summit. The Urgent Measures are  related to legislation and regulation; national-level enforcement  (capacity); international enforcement and collaboration; and outreach  and public awareness. The Urgent Measures document was signed by  Zimbabwe, Somalia, Zambia, Germany, the United States, United Kingdom,  Botswana and IUCN.

With at least 50,000 African elephants being killed each  year ,  EIA believes that the need of the hour is to ensure that these urgent  measures are implemented in reality. In particular, it is crucial that  where penalties for wildlife offences are insufficient, the relevant  laws are strengthened and that maximum deterrent sentences for wildlife  crime are imposed using a combination of laws.\nFurther, there must be accountability and transparency in the  process, with the implicated countries accurately and regularly  reporting on progress made to implement such measures.\nEIA is pleased that the European Union, Germany and The Netherlands  also pledged funding for the implementation of these urgent measures.\nIn addition, Elephants Without Borders ,  a charitable organisation based in Botswana which is dedicated to  conserving wildlife and natural resources and a long-term ally of EIA,  announced that it has received funding to conduct a pan-African aerial  survey of elephant populations.\nThis major elephant conservation initiative in Africa could provide new information critical to the species’ future survival.\nSource:  WWF.panda.org\nFrench  President François Hollande called on the “conscience of consumer  countries” to put an end to the rampant poaching of elephants and rhinos  in Africa, during a speech to African presidents on Thursday.\n“These  are countries for which we have great respect.

Following a coup, the Dzanga-Sangha reserve  can no longer be properly run. That’s opened the door to rampant illegal  poaching.\nThe rainforest of the Central African Republic is home to rare wild  elephants, marsh antelopes and lowland gorillas which are protected by  international organizations. But the country is one of the most  politically instable places in the world. Following a coup, poachers and  armed militias stormed the base of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in the  Dzanga-Sangha reserve earlier this year. The station was destroyed and  around 30 elephants were killed. Until today, environmental activists  and conservationists are unable to return to the park because the  situation remains dangerous and chaotic. It’s not just the local  population that is suffering as a result, but also the region’s  elephants, antelopes and gorillas. Poaching remains a highly lucrative  business in the region as well as in the protected reserves in the  neighboring states of Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo  (DRC). Poor equipment, corruption and weak political will have  complicated efforts to halt species loss in the DRC. However, there’s no  dearth of funds to help protect biodiversity in the region.

And while some of the greatest threats  have changed since then, the need for conservation of the species is  just as pressing as it was 40 years ago. \nDr. Masha Vorontsova,  IFAW Regional Director for Russia and CIS, has been an influential  advisor to the Russian government on polar bear conservation policies  and anti-poaching measures. \"We need to meet these threats head on  instead of expecting the 40-year-old agreement to do so adequately,\"  said Vorontsova. \"The USSR was the first country to raise concern on the  wellbeing and survival of polar bears. All hunting for polar bears was  forbidden as early as 1957. Nowadays, the Russian government has shown  great leadership in hosting this conference. Now we need a declaration  for polar bear protection that will address the changing dynamics of the  threats they face.\"\nAn IFAW delegation at the Polar Bear Forum is  one of only five non-governmental organizations joining government  representatives from all of the range countries at the forum, which will  be hosted by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.\n\"The living  symbol of the Arctic is under the gun – both figuratively in the case of  climate change, and literally in the case of poaching and  over-exploitation for trophies and parts,\" said Azzedine Downes, CEO of  IFAW. \"There is no arguing that climate change is a significant factor  in its imperilment, which is why we must step up efforts to protect the  species by addressing climate change.  However, tackling climate change  will be neither fast nor easy, therefore in the meantime, we must also  alleviate other threats to polar bears that can be more readily  addressed.  Overexploitation of the species for trophies and commercial  sale of skins and other products is one such threat, which is  unnecessary and can be fixed through policy changes.\"\nEarlier this  year, IFAW Russia conducted a study to monitor the Russian language  Internet for advertisements of sale and purchase of a number of  CITES-listed animal derivatives. It is worth noting that although polar  bear hunting has been prohibited in Russia since 1957, Russia allows the  importation of polar bear skins and their parts when accompanied by a  CITES certificate.  Unfortunately, in a month's span, a total of 75  advertisements were found for selling/buying polar bear parts and  derivatives, mostly pelts and carpets made of pelts. Some read \"Need  spare parts of polar bear. Head down to ears, possible with ears\" and  \"Stuffed polar bear head. Trophy pelt. Imported from Germany in 1945.  Only head remains.\" There was also one for a sofa upholstered entirely  of polar bear skin with intact paws at the end of the armrests. The  pelts of the polar bars imported from Canada are offered at increasingly  high price (up to 2.000.000 rbl, about 64,000 CAD, as of November,  2013).

But being a veteran isn’t a  description limited to Homo sapiens. As long as humans have  been going to war, animals have been serving alongside them in battle.  Horses are the most common compatriots, but others may surprise you—even  the humble glow worm has served in its own incandescent uniform. Here  are some of the most unusual animals that have aided troops on the  battlefield.\nDogs (and one cat)\nCanines’ keen senses of smell and hearing have long helped soldiers  sniff out bombs and land mines, locate wounded soldiers, and warn of  impending attacks. Russian soldiers used sled dogs for transportation, and one American pit bull mix, Sergeant Stubby, was  given his sergeant title after attacking a German spy in World War I.  But dogs have also been used for less than noble purposes. Before the  Civil War, bloodhounds were used to track down runaway slaves, and one  (thankfully canceled) project in World War II used dogs to deliver  explosives to the enemy.\nIn 1943, the United Kingdom created the Dickin Medal to award to animals who served in World War II. The majority of the 54  medal recipients were given to dogs and carrier pigeons, but one  stalwart cat named Simon was awarded the medal for killing off a nefarious, ration-stealing rat  population aboard a British naval ship, even after being injured by a  cannon blast that killed 17 of the ship’s crew. Simon and 11 other  Dickin Medal recipients are interred at Ilford Animal Cemetery outside London.\nGlow worms\nIn World War I, British soldiers found bioluminescent allies in glow worms .  After collecting thousands of worms in jars, soldiers would use them to  illuminate messages and maps in the dark trenches. In 2004, the British  government honored the glow worms and other military animals  with a memorial sculpture bearing an inscription: “This monument is  dedicated to all the animals that served and died alongside British and  allied forces in wars and campaigns throughout time. They had no  choice.”\nSource:  AllAfrica.com\nBy Jennifer Winter\nThe temperature was hot and the streets were crowded with evening  commuters - two conditions that would give anyone pause to stay out  after a long day in the office.\nFortunately, for Tanzania's wildlife and ecosystems, that didn't keep  an intimate group of friends and partners of the Frankfurt Zoological  Society (FZS) from gathering for an evening of cocktails and  collaboration, at Akemi Restaurant in Dar es Salaam recently ( October  24). Key planners, policymakers, donors and conservationists came  together to reinforce their shared belief that Tanzania's biodiversity  can be protected - and strengthened - through cooperation across  private, non-profit and government sectors.\nAttendees were honoured to have among them the Director of Wildlife  in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism , Prof Alexander  Songorwa. Prof Songorwa indicated his optimism for the work the  conservation community was doing in Tanzania, including FZS's continued  support on the country's conservation sector. \"I would like to applaud  FZS for their efforts in conservation.\nWhen they hear a cry, they do not ask who is crying or why, they rush  to help,\" Prof Songorwa said. Poaching remains one of the top  priorities for conservationists worldwide, necessitating collaboration  from organisations and governments across the globe.\nOne such partner for Tanzania and FZS, is the German Embassy. Lena  Thiede, Counsellor for the Germany Embassy, emphasised the history and  importance of partnerships between governments and organisations.\n\"Germany has provided support to Tanzania for the protection and  sustainable management of the unique ecosystems of Serengeti and Selous  for many decades,\" Thiede said. \"FZS has always been an excellent  partner in this effort.\nGiven the massive increase in poaching in East Africa the German  Government has recently stepped up its collaboration with FZS in the  fight against poaching in Tanzania,\" Thiede added.

This healthy food may also be prepared with a variety of fish like turbot, halibut, bream  and perch. Fresh and frozen, sturgeon is a popular delicacy in many  countries and their eggs (caviar) are excellent in appetizer recipes .  It’s very sad to say that the existence of this fish, one of the most  primitive fish still surviving, is threatened by us humans.\nRegulation  of river flow and over-fishing are the major reasons for sturgeon  population declines over the 20th century. Sturgeon are vulnerable to  over-fishing because of their late sexual maturity (6-25 years).\nSturgeon  fishing and trade in the products is a very profitable business.  Compared to other fishery activities it is often viewed as “gold-mining”. Illegal harvest and trade in sturgeon products is a well  managed and operated business, controlled by organised crime and  associated with world-wide corruption. Over-fishing and poaching has led  to a significant reduction in total legal catch, in the world and  especially in the main sturgeon basin – the Caspian Sea.\nLegal and illegal trade in Caviar\nCaviar  is the unfertilised eggs of sturgeons. For many gourmets, caviar,  dubbed ‘black pearls’, is a food delicacy without parallel. The three  main traded species of sturgeon produce distinctive caviar: Beluga,  Osietra (Russian sturgeon) and Sevruga (stellate sturgeon). The colour  and size of the caviar are influenced by the species and the stage of  maturity of the roe. The most sought after and expensive caviar is from  beluga, a gigantic fish that can weigh as much as 1,200 kg, measure five  metres and live for 100 years. Today, Iran and Russia are the main  exporters of caviar, about 80% of which is taken from three species of  sturgeon in the Caspian Sea: Russian sturgeon (around 20% of the  market), stellate sturgeon (28%) and Persian sturgeon (29%).

The targets are the elephants’ tusks, made of ivory that can be shipped abroad and sold for more than $1,000 per pound in rapidly growing Asian markets. Wildlife trafficking is valued at $7-$10 billion a year, making it the fifth most lucrative illegal activity after the drug trade, human trafficking, oil theft and counterfeiting. And because the penalties for poaching tend to be far more weaker than the punishment for trading drugs or people, it’s become an attractive business for criminal syndicates and terrorist groups alike. “Poaching has become an enormous problem and one of the most profitable criminal activities there is,” says Peter Seligmann, the CEO of Conservation International. “It’s destabilizing to nations, it’s a threat to security forces and it’s a serious loss for local economies that depend on wildlife.” The illegal wildlife trade is blood money at its bloodiest.\nPart of the problem is that the good guys have long been outgunned by the bad guys. Rangers in African nations are often poorly equipped compared to syndicate-backed hunters with night-vision goggles and high-powered rifles. But a new commitment that will be announced later this morning at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) summit in New York may begin to balance the fight. An alliance of conservation groups—including CI, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) and the International Fund for Animal Welfare—will come together with a number of African nations to improve anti-poaching efforts on the ground, disrupt international trafficking networks—and perhaps most importantly, work to cool the feverish demand for ivory products in the rising consumer nations of Asia. “We have a proposed strategy to stop the killing, stop the trafficking and stop the demand,” says Cristian Samper, the president of WCS. “We need to step up the game.”\nThis isn’t the first time wide scale poaching threatened ivory-carrying species like the African elephant and the even-rarer rhino—the 1980s were marked by the bloody “Ivory Wars” that only came to an end in 1989 when the members of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) voted to ban the sale of ivory altogether. Ivory jewelry became taboo in much of the world, which reduced the demand and the killing. Elephant and rhino numbers were able to recover.\nBut the tremendous economic growth in Asian nations like China has created a new and massive class of consumers who have the money to buy ivory. And with the demand growing, criminal syndicates have moved into ensure the supply. That means more dead elephants and rhinos—South Africa alone has been on a pace to lose almost 1,000 rhinos this year, which would be a huge increase from the less than 20 rhinos that were poached annually on average between 2000 and 2008. “If you look at the number of new consumers in China who have enough disposable income to buy ivory jewelry and you look at the number of elephants left, you can see that if everyone in that demographic bought a kilo of ivory, there’s be no elephants left,” says Azzedine Downes, the president of IFAW.\nIt’s bad enough that poachers are hunting elephants, rhinos and other threatened species to death. But wildlife trafficking has also become an international security issue. There’s evidence that militant groups like al-Shabaab, the al-Qaeda-backed Somali terrorist group responsible for the devastating attack on a Nairobi shopping mall last week, are funded partially by the illegal wildlife trade. Ivory is an ideal substance for criminals to trade—it’s portable and valuable, its origin can easily be erased and the criminal penalties for poaching rarely amount to more than a small fine. As the militants have moved in, poaching has gotten more sophisticated and bloodier. African wildlife agencies that were used to policing local hunters are now involved in a “low-level form of counterinsurgency,” as Ian J. Saunders put it in a report this year for the International Conservation Caucus Foundation. There’s a cost in lives—at least 1,000 park rangers have been killed in the line of duty over the past 10 years. “People look at elephants as capital on the hoof,” says Patrick Bergin, the CEO of AWF. “The poachers might have night-vision goggles, and the rangers don’t even have proper rain gear.”\nThe funds that are part of the commitment announced at CGI will be used to support governments in Africa—including Botswana, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Kenya, South Sudan, Malawi and Uganda—in anti-poaching efforts at 50 priority elephant sites, hiring and supporting another 3,100 park guards. On the trafficking side, money will go to strengthen intelligence networks and toughen the laughably light penalties for poaching and trading. There’s also an agreement to try to raise an additional $70 million over the next three years to further the fight. The partners behind the agreement will also work together to reduce the demand for ivory in consuming countries, in part by trying to highlight the connection between ivory products and wildlife slaughter. “A lot fewer people would buy an ivory trinket if they knew it required slaughtering a magnificent animal,” says Carter Roberts, the president and CEO of WWF.\nThat might sound like a tall order, but there’s already progress being made. Earlier this year the Thai Prime Minister Thai Yingluck Shinawatra announced that her country—a major ivory consumer—would begin the legislative process of ending the ivory trade. In China, the retired basketball star Yao Ming has worked to raise awareness in his home country about the bloody consequences of wildlife trafficking, just as he’s done with shark-fin soup , which leads to the slaughter of millions of sharks each year. Change is possible—in an interview with TIME, Chelsea Clinton, who’s now the vice chair of the Clinton Foundation and who helped put together the commitment, noted that the popularity of pianos in middle-class homes in the 19th century led at the time to a huge uptick in the killing of elephants, whose tusks were used to make ivory keys. When consumers began to become aware of the slaughter, they pushed piano companies to find new materials to make their keys. “You can change the demand dynamics,” she says.\nThis is a key moment in the fight against wildlife trafficking. On one hand, poaching might be as bad as it has ever been, adding a mortal threat to species that already face habitat loss, disease and climate change. On the other hand, the growing awareness that wildlife trafficking is becoming an international security issue—one connected to terrorism—mean that more resources will be devoted to fighting it. When she was Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton made wildlife trafficking a priority in part because, as she noted in a 2012 meeting , it has “serious implications for the security and prosperity of people around the world.” On a visit to Africa earlier this year, President Obama announced an executive order to combat trafficking, and established a task force on the subject. “This is a security issue because of how closely ivory trafficking is linked to destabilizing forces in central and west Africa,” says Chelsea Clinton. “It’s also a conservation and development issue. I know I don’t want my children to grow up in a world without elephants.”\nIf poaching continues unabated, that’s a very real possibility. Hopefully, today’s commitment at CGI is a sign that the world is up to the challenge of stopping the illegal slaughter, trafficking and consumption of some of the most majestic animals to walk the Earth.\nBryan Walsh is a senior editor at TIME.\nSubscribe Popular Among Subscribers\n\n"
