Trumpton - TV.com Trumpton - Show News, Reviews, Recaps and Photos - TV.com\nEDIT\nWelcome to the Trumpton guide at TV.com. Here is the clock, the Trumpton clock. Telling the time steadily, sensibly. Never too quickly, never too slowly. Telling the time for Trumpton. Gordon Murray's 1967 series for the BBC, Camberwick Green, was an immediate success and an instant classic, and naturally he was asked to produce a second run of episodes. But, feeling that he had exhausted the possibilities for the village setting of that series, he instead came up with a sequel. Trumpton carried on the style of Camberwick Green, but this time the setting was a busy market town, complete with town hall and resident mayor. There was a whole new cast of characters, including Mrs Lovelace (and her yappy dogs), Chippy Minton the carpenter and, most famously of all, the town fire brigade, whose roll-call (\"Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble, Grubb!\") became the series' catchphrase. But the main theme remained: whether in a small village or a bustling market town, the residents always helped each other out and a problem shared was a problem solved. Unlike Camberwick Green, Gordon Murray didn't pen his own screenplays for Trumpton. Instead, children's author Alison Prince was drafted in to turn Murray's stories into scripts, and added a lot of ideas (and humour) of her own. Freddie Phillips wrote a brand new batch of songs to introduce the characters, and once again Brian Cant provided all the voices. The result was a sequel that more than lived up to its predecessor and, like Camberwick Green, would be repeated over and over for more than twenty years.moreless\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n... to Camberwick Green but set in the larger, nearby town of Trumpton.

It says much for its impact on me that I wrote the above quotation from memory!\nTrumpton was the largest of the three settlements in Trumptonshire (Camberwick Green being a village and Chigley a hamlet). In Trumpton was located the Town Hall, which boasted the rather grand Trumpton Clock. The Town Hall was presided over by the Mayor, with help from Mr. Troop the Town Clerk and the services of their chauffeur, Philby. In the town centre were most of the shops, including Mr. Clamp the greengrocer, Mr. Platt the clockmaker, Mr. Munnings the printer and Miss Lovelace (with her three dogs Mitzi, Daphne and Lulu) the milliner. Under the statue of Queen Victoria in the centre sat Mrs. Cobbett, selling her flowers.\nThis tranquil setting was often visited by labourers who lived outside the town, notably Chippy Minton the carpenter and his son Nibs (odd name!) Whenever the good citizens of Trumpton had a problem, the would always call...The Trumpton Fire Brigade! (Altogether now - Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble, Grubb.) Led by the long-suffering Captain Flack, the boys would come out to get cats down from trees, rocking-horses off bonfires - almost anything, in fact, apart from putting out a fire. And, they ended every episode by giving a band concert for everyone in the park.\nIn all seriousness, however, the makers of 'Trumpton' recognised the importance to children's stories of a good plot, rounded characters, repeated features (e.g. the Fire Brigade and Clock sequences) and a satisfying ending. It says much that, twenty-odd years after last seeing it, I can remember so many of the characters and story lines. Bring it back - I think today's children would enjoy it.\n15 of 16 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\n\"Here is the clock, the Trumpton clock. Telling the time ... never too quickly, never too slowly. ... double-duty as the Town Band, time never drags in Trumpton. ... The Trumptonshire Web - Trumpton The Trumptonshire Web - Trumpton\n   Trumpton\nSongs by  Gordon Murray ,  Freddie Phillips   and Alison Prince .\nEach episode would begin with the announcement:\n\"Here is the clock, the Trumpton clock. Telling the time steadily, sensibly, never too quickly, never too slowly. Telling the time for Trumpton.\"\nThe clock tower would then do its stuff, and with the clock showing nine o'clock, some of the townspeople would begin their daily business: Mr Clamp showing off his fine display of vegetables, and Mrs Cobbit arriving with her flowers.\nThen the day's events would unfold with the arrival of perhaps Chippy Minton in his truck, or perhaps Mr Troop the town clerk.\nTrumpton was the main town in the county of Trumptonshire. It had a town hall, with a clock tower, numerous shops, and a fine market square in the middle of which stood a statue of Queen Victoria. The town also had a rather nice park with a bandstand, and it was at this bandstand that the Trumpton fire brigade would play us out at the end of each episode, while the people from Trumpton and nearby areas listened and watched. Why this did not clash with the six o'clock dance at Chigley was never explained...\nMr Clamp the greengrocer, and his cat Aggee\nApart from selling fruit and veg, Mr Clamp was also the judge at the fruit & veg show.\n\"The Greengrocer\"\nCome buy my vegetables, fruit ripe and beautiful. Fine fresh and fancy, come buy them from me. Come buy, come buy, come buy them from me.  Cabbages carrots and tender spring greens, Broccoli, brussel-tops, fresh runner beans, Peaches and plumbs, pears by the pound Parsnips and beetroot, straight from the ground. Apples and oranges, strawberries too. Mushrooms, gathered in this morning's dew. Radishes, lettuces, onions shallottes, Tomatoes, potatoes and lots and lots - of spinach.  Come buy my vegetables, fruit ripe and beautiful. Fine fresh and fancy, come buy them from me. Come buy, come buy, come buy them from me.\nMr Troop the townhall clerk\nAlthough Mr Troop appeared in many of the Trumpton episodes he didn't actually do much that was noteworthy. His most important contribution was suggesting to calling the Trumpton Fire Brigade.\nThe Mayor of Trumpton\nThe mayor and Mr Troop were the only staff working in Trumpton town hall. They were always very eager to call the fire brigade, a bit too eager sometimes...\nThe Signing Song:\nFire Brigade, library, road repairs, postage stamps Rubbish bins, swimming baths, broken window panes Park gates, water works, painting all the street lamps Dust cart, youth club, church bazarre, drains\n\"The Round Pond\"\nI like the robin's merry song The thrush's and the lark But best of all I like the ducks Who swim in Trumpton Park  For Ducks will never fly away as soon as I appear They swim up in their search for food without a sign of fear Their heads are dark and shiny green, their feathers brown and white Their yellow beaks are broad and flat, their eyes are round and bright.\nMr Antonio the ice cream man\nMr Antonio drove a white,pink and green ice cream van. He also delivered ice cream wholesale to important customers (like Lord Belborough).\n \"Ting-a-Ling-a-Ling\"\nTing aling aling aling here's the ice cream man If you want to buy a lolly come as quickly as you can If you'd rather have an ice You will find they're very nice Just hurry up and buy one from the ice cream man  Would you rather have a choc-ice or a cornet or a brick ? Or if you buy a lolly please don't throw away the stick Find the nearest litter bin Put the stick and paper in And buy another lolly from the ice cream man\nTrumpton Fire Brigade\nThese seven fearless fire men could deal with all sorts of trouble. From cats up trees to apple picking - no job was too difficult. In the afternoons, the firemen would play in the bandstand in Trumpton Park and the town's people would gather to watch and listen. Fortunately there were no fires in the afternoons, but then there were no fires in the mornings either.\nCaptain Flack\nHe would always answer the 'emergency' phone call, then flick a switch on his control unit which sounded the fire station bell. At the top of the control unit was a map - of the area around Florence, in Italy. Captain Flack always gave the orders - in a very clear manner - \"DESCEND !\".\nFor some reason there has always been much confusion over the names of the firemen. This is compounded by recent publications which are themselves inconsistent. The definitive answer however is:\nPugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble, Grubb.\nFiremen ready (43k sound file)\nThe firemen's names were thought up by Alison Prince who wrote the Trumpton scripts, although her original roll call had just one Pugh. Freddie Phillips who wrote all the music for Trumptonshire then suggested adding a second Pugh to give the roll call a \"musical foot\", as he put it.\nPugh and Pugh were in fact twins. If you're still in doubt, then read the interview with Gordon Murray . He specifically refers to them as twins - and after all, he should know. The Trumpton annuals of the time are consistent, with twin Pughs.\nBarney McGrew was the bearded fireman who always got to drive. Cuthbert was the one who rode in the hoist and had an aunt.\nThe firemens' theme tune, known as \"Firemen Bold\", must be one of the most memorable tunes of the Trumptonshire series, even though it had no lyrics.\nCuthbert's Aunt\nA minor character who caused great confusion when she visited Trumpton to see her nephew.\nPoliceman Potter - not to be confused with PC McGarry (of Camberwick Green), Policeman Potter was the officer of the law at Trumpton.\nChippy Minton - the carpenter, wife Dora and son Nibbs.\nThey lived in a small semi, next door to Mrs Cobbit, on the Oakridge Road. Chippy and his son worked as a team. They had a workshop at the back of the house.\n\"The Carpenter\"\nI like my job as a carpenter, There's nothing I'd rather be. I've had my tools for many long years, They're all good friends to me.  A mallet and drill are in my bag A file and gimmlet too. Sand paper sheets a brace and bit. A bradawl and some glue.  I like my job as a carpenter, There's nothing I'd rather be. I've had my tools for many long years, They're all good friends to me.  I've chisels and saws all keen and sharp, A jack and a smoothing plane. I Know that oak will plane up true , while mahogany changes grain  I like my job as a carpenter, There's nothing I'd rather be. I've had my tools for many long years, They're all good friends to me.\nMiss Lovelace - the hat maker, (pekinese) dogs Mitzy, Daphne and Lulu.\nA genteel lady who owned the hat shop in Trumpton. Her three (rather annoying) dogs caused trouble in several episodes.\n\"The Milliner\"\nA hat for a young girl, so sweet and so slim, Has long velvet ribbons and a wide shady brim. With a bright yellow daisies so fresh and so fair, To echo the colour of her long golden hair.   A hat for a lady so fine and so grand, Must always be fashioned with a pure silken band, And one single hat pin of a silver so rare, To set as a contrast to her glossy black hair.\nPhilby the Mayor's driver\nHe drove and polished the Mayor's vintage car\nMrs Cobbit the flower seller\nShe lived next door to the Minton family. Although they were situated out in the country, it was close enough to let Mrs Cobbit walk into Trumpton town centre.\n\"The Flower Seller\"\nRoses, roses, buy my red roses, Scented so sweetly and fresh as the dew. Roses, roses, come you fine gentlemen, Buy a bunch of red roses a nose gay for you.  Violets, violets sweet smelling violets, Purple and tiny and fresh as the dew. Violets, violets, come you fine ladies, A bunch of sweet violets, a posey for you.\nMr Craddock the park keeper\n\"The Litter Song\"\nSilver paper, toffee paper, dirty bit of cardboard. Chair ticket, bus ticket, button from a dress. Chocolate wrapper, envelope, another bit of cardboard. Can't they use the litter bins and not make such a mess.  Leave litter in the litter bins and never leave a mess!\nMr Robinson the window cleaner\n\"The Window Cleaner\"\nIt is hard to see out or for light to come in, Through window panes coated in a thin layer of grime, Mullioned or lattice-work, frosted or plane, Your windows will let in the sunshine again, If you send for the man who cleans windows in time.  Send for the window cleaner, don't delay send today. He will come with his ladder, his leather and pail, And wash all the grime away. He will put up his ladder and fill up his pail, Wring out his leather and give it a shake. The panes that he cleans, he will clean without fail, Because of the pains he will take, Be-cause of the pains he will take.  Send for the window cleaner, don't delay send today. He will come with his ladder, his leather and pail, And wash all the grime away.\nMr Munnings the printer\nHe prints everything and anything, but particularly the posters for the Trumpton band concert\n\"The Printer\"\nI line up all the letters with spaces in between, And clamp them in the printing press a wonderful machine. Posters are in capitals, bold and fat and tall, But the printing in the daily news is often rather small.  Now the inky roller comes down the type and back, And makes the letters ready to be printed clear and black. I check the pile of paper for every single sheet, Will be printed by the inky type with letters clear and neat.  When they have a flag day I print the little flags, Notices and labels and even paper bags. I make the letters stand up straight and keep the paper clean, Then the job will be as good as anyone has seen.\nMr Platt the clockmaker\n\"The Clockmaker\"\nClocks are like people, Clocks are like you and me. Each has its own personality.  Big clocks small clocks, Grandfather tall clocks, Cuckoo clocks, hall clocks, Mantlepiece and Wall clocks, Clocks for the school room, the kitchen and the nursery, Alarm clocks to waken us, urging puctuality.  All of them chiming or whirring or clicking, Cuckooing or ringing or tick-tock ticking.\nRaggy Dan the rag and bone man\nTrumpton's number one recycler.\n\"The Rag and Bone Man\"\nRags, bottles and bones I cry, Rags and bones I buy, I buy. Listen for me as I'm passing by Rags, bottles and bones I cry, Rags, bottles and bones.  Brick-a-brac bicycles, books or brass, Rags and bones I buy, I buy, Pottery, pewter or china and glass Rags, bottles and bones  Turn out the attic and under the stairs, Rags and bones I buy, I buy. Old fashioned furniture, sofas or chairs, Rags, bottles and bones I cry, Rags bottles and bones.\nMr Bolt the borough engineer\nWe hear about Mr Bolt in the episode \"The Greenhouse\", where he is called to inspect a dangerous chimney.\nNick Fisher the bill sticker\nIf you have a lot of posters to put up, don't do it yourself, let a professional bill sticker do it properly.\nContrary to what some people thought, his name was not Bill Stickernik - and he was not of East European origin!\n\"Bill Sticker Nick\"\nPasting up the posters, sticking up the bills. Putting up advertisements for sausages and pills. Flower shows and concerts, you can take your pick. All neatly stuck by bill-sticker Nick.\nWalter Harkin the painter & decorator\n\"The Painter\"\nPeople will ask me what colour to use. There's pink and there's purple, its so hard to choose. Some ask for yellow and some ask for green, And some ask for grey so the dirt won't be seen. Red is exciting and orange is bright, And purple is rich as the sky at midnight. Crimson is splendid for one kitchen wall, And pink is quite pretty, perhaps in the hall.  Black paint and brown paint just simply won't do, For an old fashion house where the windows are few. For I think an old house is nicer than new.  Paint it white.\nMr Wilkins the plumber\n\"The Plumber\"\nHot water heater takes too long to heat, Overflow pipe dripping into the street. A leaky old tap, or broken waste trap, Just send right away for the plumber.  Ball valve corroded or mud clogged the drain, Winter has brought frozen pipes once again. So turn off the tap that shuts off the main, And send right away for the plumber.  Water tank leaking and blocked with dead leaves, That Winter's cold winds have blown under the leaves. The water comes stealing, down through the ceiling, So send right away for the plumber.  The cause of the trouble is very soon found. The old tank is lowered with care to the ground. The new one erected and quickly connected, And weatherproof, water tight, tidy and trim, Is soon with clear water filled uo to the brim.  An excellent job by the plumber.\nMr Wantage (and his assistant Fred) the telephone engineers\nIn the days before British Telecom, these two fine engineers would solve your telephone problems - eventually.\n\"The Post Office Engineer\"\nRing Ring I work for Post Office telephones. I'm the man you send for if a fault appears. I check the cable, wire and cord, connected to the telephone, And then discuss the remedy with other engineers.  Hello! Hello! We're working on the line.  Ring ring ring ring replace your receiver please. Post Office Telephones will send an engineer. Your phone was disconnected, By a fault that's now corrected. We are sorry to have troubled you, But now the line is clear.  Hello! Hello! Your line has now been cleared.  Ring ring ring ring I test all the telephones, Making certain all the lines are loud and clear. Investigating each complaint, Of noises loud and voices faint. The daily occupation of a P.O. engineer. The occupation of an engineer.\nThe Artist\nThe Artist appeared in the episode \"The Mayor's Birthday\", in which he painted a picture of the town hall.\nI wander through the country side With easel, brushes, paints and stool And settle in a leafy glad By willow tree and shady pool.  I draw a picture first of all With simple lines of green or blue And then I fill the drawing in With painted shapes of every hue.  And when at last my picture's done I pack it carefully away And wander on across the fields To return another day.\nFrom the sleeve of  A Visit to Trumpton record - by Gordon Murray.\nTrumpton is a market town set in the heart of rural England, within a short bus-ride of Camberwick Green.\nThe Market Square is like many other market squares, with its handsome Gothic Town Hall, the statue of the middle-aged Queen Victoria, and an assorted collection of shops and houses; but one feature is unique - the Trumpton Clock.\nEvery morning, the people of Trumpton take in their milk, open their shops and set out their wares. They do this with one eye on the town hall clock, and one ear too, for they know that dead on the hour a slight rumble from the recesses of the tower will announce that free entertainment is about to begin.\nWith a loud clonk the two doors on either side of the clock face slide open. To the regular rhythm of a gay mechanical tune, the gilt figures of Sir Rufus and Lady de Trompe emerge and solemnly strike the hour on a bell.\nNot until the automatons have returned to the tower and the doors have shut do the townspeople resume their activities. The Mayor, in his parlour, discusses municipal affairs with Mr Troop, the Town Clerk. Below the Victoria statue, Mrs Cobbit, the flower seller, talks to Miss Lovelace, who keeps the hat shop. Miss Lovelaces three pekes, Mitzi, Daphne and Lulu, are yapping excitedly in anticipation of their walk in Trumpton park.\nMr Munnings, the printer, waves a friendly greeting to his next-door neighbour, Mr Clamp, the greengrocer. Outside his shop, Mr Platt, the clockmaker, is taking down the shutters and seeing that the goods in his windows are nicely arranged.\nA toot on the horn announces the arrival of Chippy Minton, the carpenter, and his son, Nibs. They park their truck behind the ancient mayoral car and greet Philby, the smartly-liveried driver, who is busy polishing the brass headlamps.\nWith a flurry of scarlet robes, the Mayor emerges from the town hall. Quick greetings all round, a buttonhole from Mrs Cobbit, and with a roar he is driven off to visit the Trumpton Fire Station.\nCaptain Flack is ready. As the Mayor arrives, the fire-bell shatters the peace of the countryside. The great doors swing open and the six stalwart firemen slide down the pole.\nPugh! Pugh! Barney McGrew! Cuthbert! Dibble! Grubb!\nNo one is missing. The Mayor inspects them and crosses to the Fire Engine - the most modern, sleekly-lined, gadget-filled vehicle it is possible to buy. It is Trumpton's pride and joy.\nThe fact that there hasn't been a fire for 30 years is, of course, rather a pity, but there are many things one can do with a modern, sleekly-lined, gadget-filled fire engine, as you will discover when you hear the two stories on this record, and since the fire brigade also do double-duty as the Town Band, time never drags in Trumpton.\nGordon Murray.\n\n"
