Is the water balloon toss really that old? No! We're talking about tug of war!\nTug of war is a sport that pits two teams against each other to test their strength using nothing more than a rope and pure muscle . Although we can't be sure exactly when the first-ever tug of war match took place, we do know that it was a long, long time ago.\nAncient Chinese texts claim that military commanders used tug of war (then called “hook pulling\") to train warriors 7,000 to 10,000 years ago. Archaeologists have also found evidence that tug of war was popular in India in the 12th century.\nThere is also evidence that tug of war was common in ancient Egypt. Old Egyptian legend holds that the sun and the moon played tug of war over light and darkness.\nThe phrase “tug of war\" didn't always refer to the game we know today, though. The Oxford English Dictionary indicates that “tug of war\" used to mean “the decisive contest; the real struggle or tussle ; a severe contest for supremacy .\" It wasn't until the 19th century that “tug of war\" became associated with the sport between two teams tugging on the ends of a rope.\nTo play tug of war, you really only need a rope — or anything with opposite ends to tug on — and at least two people. Of course, the more people involved, the more fun it is.\nThe number of people who can play is really only limited by how long the rope is. Serious tug of war contests usually pit two teams of eight players against each other.\nThe winning team is the one that pulls the other team past a predetermined point. Often this point is marked on the ground.\nFlags are spaced equally along the rope from the center point. As soon as one team pulls the other team far enough for their flag to cross the line, they win.\nTo make things even more fun, there are many variations that can be included. Sometimes teams play tug of war on either side of a small body of water, with the losers getting pulled into the water. Even more fun is playing on either side of a mud pit!\nTug of war is played in probably every country in the world. Many countries have even set up national governing bodies to oversee the sport. Today, there are more than 50 countries associated with an international tug of war governing body, known as the Tug of War International Federation (TWIF) .\nAlthough tug of war was included in the Olympic Games from 1900 to 1920, it is no longer an Olympic sport. Tug of war is currently played in the World Games, and the TWIF regularly organizes tug of war world championships. So, yes, even grown-ups still play tug of war!\nWonder Words (18)\nTest your knowledge\nWonder What's Next?\nA cup of chai tea may be the perfect drink to help you relax after tomorrow’s Wonder of the Day!\nTry It Out\nAre you ready to play tug of war? Find a few friends or family members to help you check out the following activities:\nWant to test your strength? That's right! It's time to participate in that centuries-old game known as tug of war. You'll need a few players to start. Split up into teams of comparable size. Find a rope…or something similar to tug upon. Mark the center of the rope with a marker or some tape. Also mark a center line on the ground as the starting point for the center of the rope. You can use tape, paint, a stick, chalk, or something similar. Measure the same distance from the center of the rope on each side and mark it with a flag or a strip of cloth. Depending upon how far you want the winning team to have to pull the other team, you can make this distance as short or as long as you want it to be. Assign someone to be the judge and start pulling!\nDid you know that tug of war has rules? When you play an informal game, you can make up as few or as many rules as you want. Some competitions do not allow people to wrap the rope around their arm, for example. In official competitions, though, you have to abide by the TWIF's international rule book, which you can read when you click here .\nDo you think strategy plays into tug of war at all? Or is it simply a contest of brute strength? Give it some thought and discuss this question with a friend or family member. What elements of strategy could play into a tug of war contest?\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nTug of war rope is a very ... Manila tug of war rope is the only type allowed by the Tug of War ...

Tug of War Rope Safety Information, Rules, and Low Rope Prices\nCALL NOW\nManila Tug of War Rope - Best for World Championships, Best for Children's Parties\nManila tug of war rope is the only type allowed by the Tug of War International Federation (TWIF), which organizes and establishes the rules for world championship games.\nIf you'd like to visit the federation website, follow the link at the bottom of this page.\nThe TWIF rules for international competition say tug of war rope should be from 10 to 12.5 centimeters in circumference (about 1 1/2\" diameter), at least 33.5 meters (about 110 feet) long (there are eight pullers on each team), and have plain whipped ends. Loops, knots, or other holdings are not allowed – and wrapping the rope around the hands or any other part of the body is considered creating a “loop” (there’s an exception for the anchor, or end puller, but even then the wrap is not tied, spliced, or otherwise locked - so it can be released quickly).\nIt makes sense to vary from certain parts of these specifications for games at picnics or children's birthday parties. The diameter can be reduced for small hands, and the length can be adjusted based on the size and number of participants and space available. Whether working with children or adults, game organizers should take the time to go over safety concerns with the participants.\nNever make a loop by wrapping the rope around the hand to get a better grip\nEspecially, but not exclusively, when using a tug of war rope with a smooth or slippery surface, there is a temptation to wrap it around ones hand to get a better grip. In addition to being against the rules, which state the rope should be held using a natural grip, with both palms facing upward and the fingers wrapped around the rope, looping the rope around ones hand is extremely dangerous. Imagine being dragged along the ground because you can't release the rope. Even worse -\nOn October 12, 2007 two high school students had their hands partially amputated during a tug of war game because they had the rope wrapped around their hands. For more information,  click here.\nNever use any type of rope other than natural manila\nWhile all synthetics fall short of Manila for tug of war ropes, nylon is probably the worst choice: A stretched nylon rope can recoil like a rubber band if released causing serious injury or worse.\nNatural manila fiber absorbs sweat, so the surface doesn’t get slippery when it’s in use. Unmanila (tan polypropylene, the least absorbent fiber) doesn’t, so it can become slippery, even though it has a ‘twisted rope’ surface and looks similar to the real thing.\nAll of our products are shipped within 1-2 business days.\nTo order by phone, call 1-800-875-8719, or order online below.

The ... A Tug of War team consists of eight pullers ... They can put you in touch with a local official or coach who will be only too ... THE TUG OF WAR ASSOCIATION THE TUG OF WAR ASSOCIATION\n \n \nIts governing body in England is the Tug Of War Association (ToWA). The other UK countries have their own associations. The ToWA was founded in 1958. Prior to that the sport was organised within the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA). The ToWA and the other UK associations are members of the The Tug of War International Federation (TWIF ).The Tug of War Association is the delegated authority for Tug of War in England by Sport England (formerly The Sports Council). Tug of war was part of the Olympic Games between 1900 and 1920.\nCompetitions\nThe ToWA organises men’s, women’s and youth competitions. Mixed teams and men’s teams pulling against women’s teams are not allowed in championship events, but mixed gender pulling is allowed (and quite common) in open competitions. Competitions under ToWA laws are held every weekend. Outdoor Tug of War (on grass) takes place from March to September, and Indoor Tug of War (on mats) takes place from October to February. All member clubs can compete at these meetings. Clubs who are not members of the ToWA may also compete for a trial period but should register with the Association if they wish to continue pulling in its competitions.\nA Tug of War team consists of eight pullers plus a coach and a trainer. The coach is the only person in the arena (apart from the judge) who may address remarks to the team during a pull. All pulls are conducted under the control of a ToWA judge. Pulls are best of three, the choice of first end being decided by the toss of a coin. The object is to pull the opposing team a distance of four metres. Teams can be disqualified for persistently infringing the rules. The rules are available on the rules page , but if you stay in a proper pulling position, i.e. facing forwards with both hands on the rope, do not sit down and do not lock the rope across your body you should be OK.\nTug of War competitions are organised in weight classes where each team of eight pullers must not exceed the stated weight. Weight classes start at 560 kilos for men and 520 kilos for women. Teams are weighed on 8-person scales. Most Tug of War meetings have 3 or 4 weight classes. Each weight class is run as a points competition (where each team pulls every other team, getting 3 points for a 2 - nil win, 2 points for a 2 - 1 win and 1 point for losing 1- 2), or as a knockout competition (where two teams end up in a final).\nThere are rules regarding footwear (very important) and clothing.\nStarting a new team?\nIf you have a novice team that competes at fun events, and would like to take it a step further, why not start competing at proper ToWA competitions? You do not have to join the Association straight away, and need not be afraid of being outclassed. Most (usually all) weights at ToWA competitions are now run as a points competition. This means that a novice team will get plenty of pulling experience competing against teams of all standards, and will soon notice an improvement in its ability. Most ToWA competitions are held on Sundays (although some also take place on Saturdays), and most Sunday competitions start at 11am thus ensuring a reasonable finishing time. The ToWA runs courses for judges and coaches anually, and at ToWA competitions you will meet lots of experienced people who will happy to share their knowledge with you. If you would like more information please contact one of the people listed on the Contacts page. They can put you in touch with a local official or coach who will be only too pleased to give you advice and assistance.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nTug-of-War: You will be amazed ... was between two teams of eight.

Tug-of-war was always contested as a part of the track & field athletics program, although it is now considered a separate sport. This may seem like an unusual Olympic sport, but in fact it was part of the Ancient Olympics, first being held in in 500BC.\nIn the modern Olympics, the tug-of-war contest was between two teams of eight. One team had to pull the other six feet along  in order to win. If after five minutes no team had done this,  the team which had pulled the most was declared the winner.\nResults\nThe best all-time performing Tug of War athletes at the Olympic Games were Frederick Humphreys, Edwin Mills and John James Shepherd with 2 gold medals and one silver. see more on the Greatest Tug of War Athlete at the Olympic Games\n1900\nUnited States - Milwaukee Athletic Club\nUnited States - St Louis Southwest Tumverein I\nUnited States - St Louis Southwest Tumverein II\nUnited States - New York Athletic Club\n1906\nGreat Britain - City of London Police\nGreat Britain - Liverpool Police\nBelgium\nTrivia\nConstantin Henriquez de Zubiera, competing for in the tug of war for France in  1900, was the first black athlete to compete at the Olympics.\nA Danish journalist who was covering the games, Edgar Aaybe,  was recruited into the combined Sweden/Denmark tug of war team in 1900 to replace an ill team member, and went on to win  a gold medal.\nThe biggest controversy  came in 1908 when the Liverpool police team competed in \"enormous shoes, so heavy, in fact, it was with great effort they could lift their feet from the ground.\" The rules had stipulated ordinary shoes, and the Americans protested, but to no avail.

How to Win at Tug of War: 6 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow How to Win at Tug of War: 6 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\nHow to Win at Tug of War\nCommunity Q&A\nTug of war is a classic game that has been played at children's parties and family gatherings for years. To win the game, all your team has to do is to prove stronger than the other team by pulling the rope over to their side. However, if you want to make sure you win, then you have to know all of the tricks. If you want to win at tug of war, just see Step 1 to get started.\nSteps\n1\nMaximize your team's strength. You should put the strongest person in the back so that he can use his strength the most and will have the least chance of slipping. Some people say you should put the strongest person in front; the problem with that is that if this player slips up, you will lose your strongest player right off the bat. You can put the strongest person in the back while keeping one of the other strong players up front. In general, you should mix up your weakest and strongest players so you don't have a row of several weak players keeping you down.\n/images/thumb/0/06/Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg/550px-Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg\n/images/thumb/0/06/Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg/300px-Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg\n/6/67/Win at Tug of War Step 1 Version 2.360p.mp4\nIf each end of your rope has a loop to place a player in, then your strongest player should go into the loop.\n2\nGet in the right position. First off, do not wrap the rope around your hands or wrists. This is guaranteed to harm you and possibly lead to a broken bone or a sprain. You should hold the rope with an underhand grip, keeping your arms as extended as you can so you can lean back most effectively. Remember that winning tug of war isn't about using your hands to pull the rope; it's about using your legs to push against the ground while holding onto the rope with your hands. If you plan to win just by pulling, you will get tired -- fast.\n/images/thumb/7/7f/Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg/550px-Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg\n/images/thumb/7/7f/Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg/300px-Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg\n/8/87/Win at Tug of War Step 2 Version 2.360p.mp4\nKeep your arms and body almost straight as you lean backwards with your upper body while planting your feet into the ground, using both of your legs as anchors. Pretend like you're sitting back into a seat that is very reclined.\nYour feet should be positioned a little wider than shoulder width apart.\nYou and your teammates will all be positioned on one side of the rope, with your arms gripping the rope from both sides.\n3\nTake small steps backward. Everyone should move in small baby steps so that both of the strongest muscles in the body (the thighs) can keep the rope on their side. If you take huge steps, you'll be much more likely to fall or trip. If you feel that your team is really beginning to dominate, you can do the power walk, by slowly walking backward sideways, with your chest facing the other side of the rope.\n/images/thumb/9/9b/Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-3-preview-Version-2.jpg/550px-Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-3-preview-Version-2.jpg\n/7/78/Win at Tug of War Step 3 Version 2.360p.mp4\n4\nPush back with your legs as much as you can. Use all your leg muscles; arms should be locked out; don’t waste energy trying to pull with your arms or you will quickly run out of energy and will lose your grip. As you slowly walk backwards with your feet, rotate your shoulders backward slightly as you inch your arms and legs backwards. Make sure to always remain in the \"nearly falling\" seated position, and to never let your legs or body get behind your arms, so that you're scrunched up under the rope with your arms ahead of you. You won't be able to get any power from this position.\n/images/thumb/3/31/Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-4-preview-Version-2.jpg/550px-Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-4-preview-Version-2.jpg\n/a/ad/Win at Tug of War Step 4 Version 2.360p.mp4\n5\nUse teamwork. Everyone should pull at the same time. This will generate the maximum amount of force that your team is supposedly capable of. Much like a dragon boat team, a good fluid and coordinated motion can easily propel \"the boat\", which in this case the opposing team forward.\n/images/thumb/7/77/Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg/550px-Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg\n/f/fe/Win at Tug of War Step 5 Version 2.360p.mp4\n6\nKeep practicing. It may take a while for your team to find a winning rhythm. As you practice together more as a team, you will find the best coordination and the best order of team members that will lead to your success. Don't get frustrated right away; once you master the technique and the teamwork, you'll be well on your way to being tug-of-war champions!\n/images/thumb/8/83/Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg/550px-Win-at-Tug-of-War-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nHow to Play Tug of War. ... If you are playing with just two people, ... Keep pulling until there is a victor. Each team’s goal is to pull the marker or flag past ... 3 Ways to Play Tug of War - wikiHow 3 Ways to Play Tug of War - wikiHow\nPlaying the Game\n1\nLay out the rope. In tug of war, opposing player or teams will pull on a rope until one of the teams or players succeeds at pulling the majority of the rope over to one side. To get started, all you need to do is take your rope and lay it out in a straight line on the ground.\nThere should be a flag or marker in the center of the rope. If not, then place one in the center of your rope before you start the game.\n2\nPlace the opponents. You can play tug of war in teams or as a one-on-one game. If you are going to have a team game, then make sure that you have an equal number of players on either side of the rope. If you are playing with just two people, then stand at opposite ends of the rope.\n3\nGrip the rope. Have all of the players pick up the rope and grip it tightly with both hands. Do this before you start the game so that everyone has a chance to get a good grip on the rope. [3]\nNever anchor the rope around your waist or coil it around other parts of your body. This can result in severe rope burn, dislocations, or rope breaks that can snap and inflict other severe or even fatal injuries. [4] [5]\n4\nPlace the judge in the center. If you have not chosen a judge yet, then do so now. The judge can be someone who does not want to play or an extra person if you have an odd number of players. Have the judge stand in the center of the rope.\nThe judge will also need a whistle (or a loud voice) to signal to other players that the game has started. [6]\n5\nSound a whistle. The judge can blow a whistle or yell “Go!” to signal to the players that the game has started. Have the judge signal the start of the game so that the players will know when to start pulling. When the judge sounds the whistle or yells, then the game has officially started.\n6\nPull as hard as you can. All players on either side should lean backwards with their feet planted as they pull to start. Try to use your body weight and leg strength to pull the rope back and away from the other team. [7]\n7\nKeep pulling until there is a victor. Each team’s goal is to pull the marker or flag past the center point. When one team or player has accomplished this goal, that team or player will be declared the winner.\nDon’t stop pulling until the judge declares a winner.\nMethod\nIncreasing Your Odds of Success\n1\nPick the right rope. You will need to have a good strong rope to play tug of war. The rope should be free of knots, fraying, or any flaws that might allow extra holding or rubbing. You may want to select a nylon rope to reduce rope-burn incidents. [8] [9]\nMake sure that the rope is long enough to accommodate all of your players as well. All of the players should have room to grip the rope and stand beside it.\n2\nMark the rope. You will need to place a marker in the center of the rope so that players will be able to find the center. Find the center of the rope and mark it with one color flag or marker. Make sure the rope is straight when you measure it to find the center. [10] [11]\nYou may also want to place markers on both sides of the central marker to indicate where players should start holding the rope. Place these markers about three feet away from the center point on both sides of the rope.\n3\nChalk up your hands. Resin is an optional way to enhance your grip on the rope. Use resin or chalk from a sporting goods store or department store. Take out a palm full of the substance and clap or rub it between your palms. Work the substance around and between your fingers as well. [12]\nThis isn’t common in casual tug of war games, but can help you hold onto the rope for more organized games.\n4\nChoose a dry, level playing ground. It can be fun to play tug of war on a slippery, muddy terrain, but this may also make it harder to win based on strength. If you want to play a fair game of tug of war, then choose a level, dry playing ground, such as a dry field or the floor of a gymnasium.\nMethod\nDressing for the Game\n1\nChoose comfortable clothing. While you can wear just about anything you want for such a casual game you might want something more athletic. You might consider wearing shorts, or sweat pants. These are going to be more flexible than other forms of outwear for your legs. A t-shirt will be more likely to flex with your movements as you play the game. [13]\nWhatever you choose to wear you should expect it to get dirty if you fall.\n2\nPick the right shoes for indoors or outdoors. Consider where you will be playing tug of war before you pick your shoes. If you are paying a game of tug of war indoors, then a regular pair of sneaker should be fine. If playing outside, you may want to choose a pair of sneakers with rubber cleats or even go for a pair of boots if the terrain is muddy. [14]\nAvoid metal cleats, steel toes, and shoes that have metal anywhere else on the sole. These types of shoes pose a hazard to your fellow players.\n3\nWear padding if available. This is optional, but it is a good idea. You should consider wearing head gear, knee pads, and elbow pads. These are the areas you are most likely to fall on and injure during a tug of war contest. [15]\nWhile most casual games of tug of war don’t require any padding you can still opt to put on protection to reduce the chance for injury. You can find rubber and plastic padding in any sport shop and many department stores.\nCommunity Q&A\nWhat are the benefits of tug of war?\nwikiHow Contributor\nWinning will boost your confidence.

                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "No, the document's mention of 'eight or nine' team members is specific to the TV show's network teams and not the official tug of war team size. It does not provide inferable or directly related context for the query.",
