        "\nDOCUMENT 1:\n\n60s and 70s Beer Guide. ... The \"Guinness is Good for You\" and \"Guinness for ... Lager gained in popularity throughout the 60s, but did not challenge draught ... The 60s and 70s Beer Guide - Retrowow The 60s and 70s Beer Guide\n60s and 70s Beer Guide\nChanging fashions ruled beer drinking in the 50s, 60s and 70s. First bottled  pale ale challenged draught mild as the Nation's favourite drink. Then a few  years later, everyone was drinking draught keg bitter, with Watneys Red Barrel  the best known brand.\nLager was the drink of the 70s. The hot summer of 1976 provided a reason to  try the beverage, but tastes were changing. In 1971 there was a backlash against  the relentless spread of keg bitter and lager when CAMRA, the Campaign for Real  Ale, formed. In the latter part of the seventies there was a resurgence of some  traditional brews; real ale, though, still remained a minority taste.\nFrom mild to bitter\nMild was the working man's drink for the first half of the twentieth century.  The only choice was between mild and stout; bitter was a luxury. In 1900 best  bitter was almost unknown and in 1929 it was still only a tiny fraction total  beer sales.\nAt the start of the sixties, mild was the dominant beer. Around 40% of the  output of Bass Charrington, Britain's largest brewer, was mild. By 1967 this had  fallen to 30%. Mild was losing favour, though it was the cheapest beer. It did  have strongholds in the Midlands (notably M & B Mild), but the majority chose  best bitter.\nBest bitter on draught and its bottled equivalent, best pale ale, were the  favourite beers of the 60s. Pale ale was sold as a premium beer; it was a  popular luxury.\nFrom cask to keg\nKeg bitter is pasteurised to stop any fermentation. Carbon dioxide is added  to give the beer sparkle. The pressure of carbon dioxide is used to draw the  beer up from the cellar. So keg beer does not need a traditional long handled  beer pump.\nThe first keg beer was Watneys Red Barrel ,  developed in the 30s. The big brewers though, did not heavily promote keg bitter  until the late 50s. The first brewer to use the term keg and to promote sales of  keg beer was Flowers (later taken over by Whitbread). Many of the others  followed suit and each launched their own brand of keg bitter: Worthington 'E',  Whitbread Tankard, Ind Coope Double Diamond, Youngers Tartan and Courage Tavern.\nSales of keg beer increased steadily throughout the sixties. In 1960 it was 1%  of the total beer market, by 1965 7% and by 1971 18%. Keg beer was most popular  with the young. It was the natural choice for the new themed pubs and disco pubs  of the 60s. Keg bitter was more expensive than traditional cask conditioned ales  and was marketed as a premium brand.\nThere was a tendency for brewers to reduce the strength and original gravity  (a measure of the proportion of ingredients, hops, barley etc to water) of cask  beers. The keg beers were the best the brewery had to offer so there was no need  to spend as much on the cask conditioned beers. Throughout the sixties people  suspected that that beer was getting weaker; they were right.\nBy the latter part of the sixties, carbon dioxide was often added to cask  beers as well; they were drawn up from the cellar under pressure in much the  same way as keg beer. For the drinker at the bar, there was little to choose  between them. The more discerning opted for keg.\nBottled and canned beer\nThe rise of keg bitter in the sixties stopped a trend that had begun after the  War of increasing sales of bottled beer. It even appeared that sales of bottled  beer might overtake draught beer. Reasons for choosing it over traditional ales  were consistency, brightness, a clean palette and sparkle. Keg bitter provided  all these qualities at a cheaper price.\nCanned beer was in its infancy in the late 50s. Ind Coopes Long Life was one of  the first. The brewer picked up on concerns about the quality of cask ales and  claimed Long Life was brewed for the can and never varied. Canned beer sales  increased throughout the sixties, but did not become important until the  seventies. Watneys Party Seven was a new take on canned beer.\nNational brands\nBefore the 60s, the supply of beer had been regional. There were a few  exceptions with bottled Guinness, Bass and Worthington sold throughout the  country. In the sixties other national names emerged, namely Double Diamond  (bottled), Mackeson Stout (bottled) and draught and bottled Watneys Red Barrel.  Watneys Red Barrel was making inroads into the free trade. Double Diamond, Bass  Worthington and most notably Guinness, were becoming increasingly available as  draught. The success of Guinness encouraged Watneys to compete with Colonel  Murphy's Stout. After a test marketing campaign, they abandoned it and stocked  draught Guinness in Watneys' houses instead.\nBy the end of the sixties, lager too was more popular. Draught Carlsberg was  available at Watneys' pubs and Whitbread had linked up with Heineken. Sales of  lager, though, did not become significant until the 70s.\nStrong beers\nStrong ales were often sold in nip bottles (one third of a pint). The most  famous was Tennant's Gold Label; it was in the Guinness Book of Records as the  strongest beer on regular sale in the UK. Later it was brewed as Whitbread Gold  Label. 70s advertisements told drinkers that it was \"Strong as a double Scotch,  less than half the price\". It is still available today.\nThe 70s keg beer and lager\nAt the beginning of the 70s, the most popular brands of keg bitter dominated  British beer drinking. They were more expensive than cask bitters, so people  must have liked the taste or bought the advertising.\nAdvertising of keg bitters made extravagant claims. Whitbread Tankard was  supposed to help you excel, how, was not made clear. Beer had long been  advertised as a drink to improve heath. The \"Guinness is Good for You\" and \"Guinness for Strength\" campaigns are famous. Was a touch of parody intended?\nRivals made equally bold claims. Worthington 'E' was \"the taste that  satisfies\". Courage Tavern was \"What your right arm's for\". Double Diamond \"worked wonders\".\nKeg bitter's popularity was challenged in the 70s by lager. Sales of lager  increased from only 2% of the market in 1965 to 20% in 1975.\nLager had been sold in Britain long before the 60s. It was brewed here as  early as the 1890s, but was a very small part of the beer market. It had a  reputation as a ladies' drink. When mixed with lime it was considered as an  alternative shandy.\nToday's well known brands of lager were introduced in Britain from the 50s.  The brewery magnate E P Taylor brought Carling Black Label to Britain, from  Canada, in 1953. Starting from small beginnings, brewed under licence by the  tiny Hope and Anchor Brewery, a series of mergers left Carling Black Label part  of the Bass Charrington empire.\nThe other big brewers introduced their own brands. Guinness launched Harp  Irish Lager in 1960. Whitbread signed an agreement to import Heineken in 1961;  Watneys linked up with Carlsberg in 1968.\nWhitbread brewed Heineken under licence in the UK in 1968. The Whitbread  directors thought a weaker version of the Dutch beer would sell better - they  were right. Later the Belgian beer, Stella Artois, joined the Whitbread stable  as their premium lager.\nIt was the long hot summer of 1976 that  firmly established Britain's taste for lager. Cool and refreshing, it was the  beer to beat the drought. By the end of the decade, lager took 29% of beer  sales.\nThere are many reasons for the rise in the popularity of lager. Package  holidays in Europe gave people a chance to try lager and they associated it with  relaxation and warmer climates. It goes better with more exotic food.  Continental dishes - French and Italian - were popular in the 70s, as were  Chinese and Indian food and there is no better accompaniment to a curry than a  pint of lager.\nFrom keg to cask\nThe aggressive promotion of keg bitters finally resulted in a backlash. CAMRA,  the Campaign for Real Ale, was founded in 1971.\nIn the 70s, sales of cask beers began to rise as there was a growing  appreciation for the traditional methods of brewing. It is a testament to the  success of CAMRA that the \"classic\" keg bitters of the sixties are now extinct.\nBeers from the past\nThere were more than 4,000 different brews available in the 60s, so we cannot  list them all. This is a list of the most important ones.\nKeg bitters on draught\nFlowers Keg Bitter\nDraught bitters\nSome of these were not available for the whole of the period. I have added  John Smith's because of its popularity today. It was very much a regional beer  in the 60s.\nBass Red Triangle\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nWelcome to the GUINNESS Â® Collectors Club ... Inside is a rhyme and signatures from approximately 60 people including Edward Guinness, ... Designated trademarks and ... The Guinness Collectors Club The Guinness Collectors Club\nThe Guinnessman Collection Sat 19th September and 11th June!\nOne of the finest collections of Guinness memorabilia goes under the hammer at BBR Auctions in Elsecar, Barnsley, South Yorkshire (www.onlinebbr.com). The collection belonged to the late Steve Smith, a lovely man and well-known to many fellow collectors. I myself spent many a happy hour with Steve, photographing his massive collection of Guinness memorabilia for inclusion in the GCC Galleries and often ending down the local supping a couple of pints of the lovely Black Stuff.\nMany very rare Guinness items will be up-for-grabs over two days - the first part of the collection will be sold on the 19th of September and the second part on the 11th of June. Contact BBR Auctions on 01226 745156 and request one of the magnificent colour brochures detailing this magnificent collection.\nIt's a one-off, not-to-be-missed event, that's for sure.\nNick Fairall, GCC.\nOriginal Guinness Gilroy oil paintings found!\nExciting news on the Guinness collectables front is the discovery of around 35 original oil on canvas Guinness adverts, measuring 36 inches by 22 inches and dating from the 1930s to the late 1950s, all signed by Gilroy. They have come originally from the S H Benson Advertising Agency archive and are even unknown to the Guinness archivists.\nAlthough many are well known to us in their finished form as posters, about 10 are images never seen before. For example there is a set of three dated 1950, with flying toucans over London incorporating scenes of St Pauls Cathedral, Tower Bridge and Nelsons Column. Another set of three US designs depicting toucans flying past the Chrysler Building NY, Golden Gate Bridge SF and the Empire State Building NY. A further set of three shows scenes of the loading of a bomber and a submarine. All these original paintings were submitted to Guinness for approval to become posters and although many didn't make final selection they all have Bensons stickers attached.\nThis type of Guinness artwork is very rare. Even some of the well known poster images are slightly different to these canvases. David Hughes has put together a 39 page A5 spiral bound booklet as a follow-up to our comprehensive release 'The Guide To Guinness Collectables' in which some 35 of these canvases are illustrated. It also contains over 250 new Guinness collectables illustrated and described. To obtain a copy of this limited edition booklet for Â£14.00 plus Â£2.00 p&p, please contact David Hughes at phim.finch@btinternet.com. View 3 of the posters here .\nTipplefair set to run and run....\nGood news. As you may know the event was to cease after 2011. However, the Pub History Society has now taken over the running of the event and it will take place in August in conjunction with the Peterborough beer Festival. For further details, visit www.tipplefair.org.uk .\nMat collectors busy again....\nOnce again a new set of beermats featuring drawings of pub frontages has been released for the Irish Market. Some new pubs have also been added from Dublin, Cork and Galway and the current total known so far is a whopping 79. What a pub crawl! NF.\nMein Gootness - Mein Kampf!\nThe Royal Naval vessel H.M.S. Pelican served with distinction throughout the Second World War, proudly claiming involvement in the sinking of a number of U-Boats. It was not all plain sailing however, the ship itself suffering major damage during an air attack in 1940.\nDespite all this, it seems the crew still found time to produce their very own form of propaganda! I recently came across this wonderful Xmas Card , produced on behalf of H.M.S. Pelican. Inside of card reads 'Best Wishes for Christmas and the New Year from H.M.S. Pelican. With acknowledgments to a famous Guinness poster.' NF.\nA nice little item from the 60s comes to light....\nI came across this little item that I had not seen before. A plastic torch, manufacturer unknown, but the label dates it to the early 1960s. Measuring 13cm in height, the bottle top unscrews for access to light the bulb and the bottle base unscrews for the battery compartment. View item . NF.\nMillennium Collectables set to lose license... but they're going out with a bang!\nFollowing the release of the incredible 250th Anniversary Clock last year, it looks as if our old friends at Millennium Collectables are set to lose the license for Guinness figurines this year. But at least they are going out on a high with two great Royal Doulton figurines to add to their high quality range of Guinness Collectables.\nThe Guinness Harpist and The Topiary Sealion figurines will be produced between April & September 2010 and anyone who is interested and not already on their mailing list can telephone them on 01636 703075 or send an email to mail@millenniumcollectables.co.uk .\nThe amazing rota-perpetuum.... rotates by itself!\nI recently came across an item that I had not seen before. A wonderful back-bar/shop window advertising display called the rota-perpetuum .\nThe item was still in its original packaging, complete with the instruction leaflet and was produced in 1970.\nThe '6 million Guinness' advertising band is interchangeable with an alternative 'Give Him A Guinness' band. NF.\nSurprising what a house clearance can turn up...\nAs a result of a house clearance, a member of the Club was lucky enough to come across these two great items:\nThe first is a menu from Park Royal , produced for the leaving lunch of a member of the Advertising department, Denise Sakula. Dated 28th October 1947, the front displays a spoof on the Gilroy zoo animals showing them crying. Inside is a rhyme and signatures from approximately 60 people including Edward Guinness, Peter Cunningham (who became MD) and Des O'Brien (who famously captained Ireland to win the Grand Slam in Rugby Union) to mention a few.\nThe second item is an example of the brown hard back Guinness Guide Book to Dublin Brewery . dated 1939. Not so uncommon you say? Well, this example was found to have a pencilled drawing by John Gilroy, on the inside back cover, of 'Dan the waiter at Jammets' (a restaurant in Dublin). This adds cachet and value to an otherwise common item.\nA rare First Day Cover to commemorate the World's First Hovercraft Service...\nSite visitor Henry Law, from Malaysia, kindly sent in a copy of a letter, sent by A.W.Fawcett to Guinness Exports Ltd, Liverpool, regarding the inauguration of the World's First Hovercraft Service, dated the 27th July 1962. View First Day Cover and letter (in new window).\n\n"
