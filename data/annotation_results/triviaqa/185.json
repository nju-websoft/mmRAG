Stormtrooper - Wookieepedia - Wikia Stormtrooper | Wookieepedia | Fandom powered by Wikia\n― Luke Skywalker [src]\nSpecialized snowtrooper armor\nStormtroopers wore a distinctive set of white armor that was used to instill fear in the Empire's subjects, while also providing the soldiers with an extended range of survival equipment and temperature controls, thus allowing them to survive in almost any environment. [1] The helmet provided skull protection, filtered air , and contained enhanced vision and communication systems. Rank was determined by a color coded pauldron worn over the left shoulder, with orange or red representing the rank of commander ,  black indicating an enlisted trooper, and white representing a sergeant . They also had a utility belt and a grappling hook attached to it, and primarily used the E-11 blaster rifle , however could also utilize the DLT-20A laser rifle or DLT-19 heavy blaster rifle when necessary. However, the stormtrooper armor was not without its faults. The plates made running hard and offered little protection against a direct blaster shot. [6] [28] The helmet also greatly obstructed a soldier's vision, which hindered their capacity to properly aim a blaster, regardless of prior training. [28]\nBy 28 ABY , stormtrooper helmets and armor were collected by individuals like the New Republic senator Ransolm Casterfo , who had an interest in Imperial \"artifacts.\" Several of Casterfo's Centrist senators including Apolin and Fatil also admired and collected Imperial uniforms and armor. In addition, Imperial armor and other artefacts also sold at markets on Chrome Citadel . [29]\nSpecialized stormtroopers\nEdit\nIn addition to the \"standard\" troops, the Empire had created a number of specialized stormtrooper units assembled to operate on varied planets and climates within its territory. Scout troopers wore lighter armor and used speeder bikes to patrol the perimeter of the Imperial garrisons they were assigned to. [19]\nSniper troopers were specialists pulled from Scout trooper ranks and wielded the deadly E-11s long-range blaster . [30] Stormtrooper snipers were also pulled from standard stormtrooper ranks, and wore a blue pauldron over their shoulder and had a visor attached to their helmet, along with a black bandolier across their chest plate. [30] There were also the Imperial combat drivers who piloted many of the Imperial Army's ground vehicles. [31]\nSandtroopers wore modified armor that allowed them to survive on desert worlds such as Tatooine. [32] To deal with problems on frozen environments, the Empire utilized their cold weather assault stormtroopers , nicknamed snowtroopers, who wore a special mask and a kama that both resembled the equipment worn by the Galactic Marines on Mygeeto during the Clone Wars. [8] [1] [17] Coastal defender stormtroopers were stormtroopers trained and equipped to operate in coastal and tropical regions, such as those found on Scarif .\nDeath trooper armor\nPhase II dark troopers wore heavy armor and were used to attack enemy defenses with assault cannons. [33] While Shadow Troopers were armed with T-21 light repeating blasters and cloaking technology along with intimidating black amour.\nSimilar to the Shadow Troopers, the black armored death troopers were an elite variant of troopers focusing on Imperial Intelligence and Imperial Navy . They were usually assigned to protect high ranking personnel and equipped with SE-14r light repeating blasters .\nMagma troopers were equipped to operate in extremely high temperatures, and were trained to fight on volcanic worlds such as Sullust. [34] [25] Spacetroopers wore armor designed to breathe in space and were used to patrol parts of the Death Star with no air. [35]\nShock Troopers were armed with heavy weaponry and wore stormtrooper armor with distinctive red markings, similar to those of Republic clone troopers who served as Coruscant Guards during the Clone Wars . [21] [36] There also existed Imperial Heavy Troopers who were equipped with heavy combat armor and electrostaffs , similar to the Imperial riot troopers . Heavy Weapons Stormtroopers wielded large, rotary blaster cannons while the more agile Jumptroopers , equipped with jet packs easily bounded over walls and other obstacles to assault targets directly. [36] Stormtrooper grenadiers wielded grenade launchers , and wore a red pauldron along with a black bandolier across their chest, while Stormtrooper chargers took down their opponents with extreme ferocity. [30]\nStormtroopers in mechanized battle armor armed with heavy handheld cannon were present at the battle of Sevarcos. [15] Purge Troopers helped enforce Imperial law in the Anoat sector , being lead by the formidable Commander Bragh during the Iron Blockade . [37] Flametroopers were stormtroopers equipped with incendiary weapons. [16] Storm Commandos were the special forces of the Stormtrooper Corps and were trained to deal with extreme combat situations. [7]\nThirty years after the Battle of Endor , variants of the former Galactic Empire's armed forces would exist under the auspices of a new organization known as the First Order . It would continue to utilize new stormtroopers , as well as megablaster heavy assault troopers , riot control stormtroopers , snowtroopers , and flametroopers . [22]\nBehind the scenes\nEdit\nEarly concept art of stormtroopers.\nStormtroopers, as depicted in the early drafts of Star Wars and envisioned by Ralph McQuarrie , were to wield lightsabers and hand-held shields. George Lucas , when composing background information for licensees in 1977 , stated that females did exist in the Stormtrooper Corps, although there were few stationed on the Death Star. He suggested that they were numerous in other units. [38]\nIn Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope , an actor playing a stormtrooper accidently hit his head on a doorway. In the Star Wars Special Editions , a sound was added for the purpose of comedy. Over the years the accident turned into a tradition by making actors hit their heads on doors in the Star Wars films. [39]\nStormtroopers were named after Imperial German Sturmtruppen, which in English translated to Stormtroopers , special troops who were tasked in the last year of World War I with mounting fierce infantry assaults on Allied trenches in an attempt to break the stalemate on the Western Front. However, many aspects of the branch of service, such as their unwavering obedience to the Emperor, their reputation for excessive force, and their status as an independent element separate from the overall army bears some similarity to the Sturmabteilung (Lit: Assault Section) of the 1930s NSDAP party in Germany, as well as the Waffen-SS or \"Armed SS\" units that served as independent military formations controlled directly by the Nazi hierarchy and not the German High Command during World War II .[ source? ]\nPanoramic view of stormtroopers marching through shallow water for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\nAppearances\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nOf Course There Are Black Stormtroopers in Star Wars. ... So a black stormtrooper can very well be a black stormtrooper in the Star Wars ... The Atlantic’s ... 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Trailer: Of Course There ... 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Trailer: Of Course There Are Black Stormtroopers - The Atlantic\nThe Atlantic\nSee our Newsletters >\nOf Course There Are Black Stormtroopers in Star Wars\nFans objecting to John Boyega in The Force Awakens' teaser aren't just close-minded; they misunderstand the galaxy far, far away.\nDisney\nPrint\nText Size\nEarlier today, it seemed like #BlackStormtrooper might actually eclipse #BlackFriday as a trending topic. That’s because the official trailer that aired Friday for the next film in the Star Wars saga—The Force Awakens, directed by J.J. Abrams and scheduled for release in December 2015—opens on a black man wearing a stormtrooper’s uniform.\nThe man, who is played by John Boyega (of Attack the Block), pops into view perspiring and panting hard. He is surrounded by desert: in all likelihood the rolling dunes of Tatooine, the homeworld of both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. And he appears to be in trouble.\nMaybe the only people more alarmed than Boyega by his circumstances were commenters surprised by the sight of a black man’s head emerging from the white plate armor of an Imperial stormtrooper. People on Reddit compared the trailer to a scene from the 1987 Mel Brooks spoof Space Balls , a gag that plays up a black stormtrooper as jive-talkin’. In other threads and on Twitter, some people registered mere racist shock. But a few corners of the Internet turned to the internal logic of the Star Wars universe to appeal the presence of a black stormtrooper. Didn’t the prequels reveal that all stormtroopers were white clones?\nRelated Story\nStar Wars and the 4 Ways Science Fiction Handles Race\nNo, they didn't. In Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi travels to the secretive planet of Kamino, where he discovers the existence of a clone army that would feed the so-called Clone Wars and eventually serve as the model for the evil Galactic Empire’s stormtrooper infantry. (Spoiler alert: Don’t watch the prequels.) Those clones weren’t white in any sense of the word. Jango Fett, the bounty hunter who served as the genetic template, was culturally (and perhaps ethnically) a Mandalorian. And the actor who portrays him, Temuera Derek Morrison, is a New Zealand-born person of brown skin and partial Maori descent.\nEven if Morrison and Fett (and all of his clones) choose to pass as white, by the time of the events of Episode IV: A New Hope, the Empire has been recruiting from general populations for years. That’s why it makes sense that a young Luke Skywalker, lured by a galaxy larger than the humble moisture farm he calls home on Tatooine, dreams of enlisting in the Imperial Navy.\nThe Empire is not a racially diverse institution. Everyone we meet in the Imperial officer corps, for example—the chain of commanders that Darth Vader is always Force-choking out—is white (and seemingly British). That said, if the Empire recruited black stormtroopers, that would be totally in keeping with a racist Empire—since black and white people are not actually from different races, the way that (say) humans and Wookies are.\nWhat distinguishes the Star Wars universe from the Star Trek universe is the fact that, outside of the goose-stepping ranks of the Imperial military structure, its universe is pretty chill on race, if not totally post-racial. No one in the Rebellion bats an eye when Lando Calrissian and Nien Nunb copilot the Millennium Falcon during the Battle of Endor in The Return of the Jedi, even though the former is a black man from Bespin’s Cloud City and the latter a fish-faced smuggler from the humid caves of Sollust. Neither of them appears to mind taking orders from Admiral Ackbar, the high-ranking Mon Calamari military mastermind, either. Han Solo even learns a lesson about doubting the diminutive Ewoks, whom he initially regards as primitive.\nThe most glaring instance of everyday prejudice across the entire original trilogy takes place in the notorious Mos Eisley cantina. “You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy,” Obi-Wan tells Skywalker as they venture in. A sketchy place, maybe, but not because Ithorians and Rodians drink alongside Aqualish and Corellians. When the bartender says, “We don’t serve your kind here,” he’s talking to the droids—marking him as a Luddite, perhaps, but not a racist, exactly.\nThe Star Wars films themselves commit racism, specifically the prequels, which seem to mock Jews and Asians with their depiction of two alien races (galactic bankers and traders, of course). Which is to say nothing of Jar Jar Binks, a walking crime against black Caribbeans. And the expanded universe depicts racism: The Emperor disdains non-human races, for example, in the comics and novels that flesh out his back story (which are not considered canon).\nSo a black stormtrooper can very well be a black stormtrooper in the Star Wars Galaxy without there being any great significance to it. It’s not that simple in the fraught universe of Hollywood, though, where casting a black actor as a lead in one of the most powerful franchises in film history can help to correct a representation gap older than Yoda—but not without drawing scrutiny. It's groundbreaking that John Boyega is not just a minor black character, the likes of which we’ve seen in the previous Star Wars trilogies, but a central star. May the Force be with him.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nStormtrooper armor was the standard armor worn by the Imperial stormtrooper. A white plastoid... Stormtrooper armor - Wookieepedia - Wikia Stormtrooper armor | Wookieepedia | Fandom powered by Wikia\n―Alliance First Sergeant Namir during the Mid Rim Retreat [src]\nDeveloped by the Imperial Department of Military Research , [1] stormtrooper armor was the standard issue armor of the Imperial Army 's Stormtrooper Corps , and was manufactured on planets such as Gilvaanen . [4] [3] It was introduced sometime after the conclusion of the Clone Wars , and was intended to replace the Phase II clone trooper armor . It was made up of 18 individual, overlapping plastoid composite plates and synth-leather boots which allowed for mobility, while also dispersing energy, protecting the wearer from glancing blaster bolts. A reinforced alloy plate ridge assisted the user's upper thigh, and a sniper position knee protector plate over a wearer's left knee helped improve accuracy when crouching. While most armor was fitted for humans, other forms were manufactured to fit other body types. [2] A soft click would inform the wearer of whether or not they had correctly attached the armor. [5] The armor was also resistant to projectile weapons and blast shrapnel. However, the plating made running difficult, and was vulnerable to direct hits from blasters or Cyclers .\nStormtroopers marching through water\nIts reinforced combat helmet featured an integrated comlink , [6] audio pick-up, two artificial air-supply hoses, and a broadband communications antenna powered by a single power cell. [7] The helmet featured built-in filtration systems that extracted breathable atmosphere from polluted environments. [2] The helmet's visual processor assisted the wearer in seeing in darkness, glare, and smoke, [1] though it limited the wearer's field of vision. [6] When firing a blaster, the helmet's visor polarized against the glare. A built-in heads-up display also provided targeting diagnostics, power levels and environmental readings at the corner of the wearer's eyesight, and one could access data on various military subjects and civilian organizations on the helmets display. In addition, motion sensors alerted the wearer to any enemy the soldier might have missed. Seeking to discourage nonessential chatter which was strictly off-limits while on-duty, stormtrooper helmets recorded everything that was said by the user, sending it to monitors to review after downloading the data off of the armor's memory. [5]\nStormtrooper armor was capable of protecting its wearer in extreme environments, including deserts , forest, icy wastelands, and limited exposure to the vacuum of space . The armor's torso plating featured environmental controls on its midsection, its black body glove was vacuum-sealed [1] and made of a smart material that could adjust to the wearers body heat and external temperature. [5] Though a rebreather pack was required for extended use in environments that lacked a breathable atmosphere or to filter potent toxins. [8] Troops in the field were allowed additional ammunition and comprehensive survival equipment, with backpacks that could feature field communicator sets, mortar launchers, and blaster components. [2] It was a punishable offense to utilize the armor's internal cooling options in noncritical situations due to its power drain, however many Imperial cadets still attempted to do so. Stormtroopers were also expected to remain in uniform at all times, with the rule considered essential for maintaining the public trust and representing the Empire in a positive, professional manner. By wearing one's armor, one represented the Empire, not the individual. [5]\nUtility belts were equipped with a variety of features including a compact toolkit, power packs, energy rations, and a holster for an E-11 blaster rifle . [3] The belts may have also featured a backup C1 personal comlink , macro binoculars, and a grappling hook . One BlasTech N-20 Baradium-core thermal detonator was given to each trooper, and was placed on the back of their utility belt. The controls to the detonater were not labeled, to prevent enemy troops from using them. While detonators were not usually used within ships or bases, troopers carried a full complement of such field gear to be prepared for any situation. [2]\nA Stormtrooper commander\nHigher ranks were signified with a color coded pauldron worn  over the right shoulder. The rank of commander was represented with an orange pauldron, [1] though one soldier who served under the Grand Inquisitor had his colored red. [9] Black identified enlisted soldiers. [2] Several black pauldroned stormtroopers accompanied Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin to the planet Lothal , [10] and later came aboard his flagship , the Sovereign , to serve as reinforcements when it was infiltrated by a band of rebels. [11] White pauldrons represented the rank of sergeant . [2] Blue pauldrons were used to identify stormtrooper snipers . [12]\nDespite small aesthetic variations in stormtrooper armor during the Age of the Empire , the changes were not large enough to denote a new phase of armor like the previous Galactic Republic's phase I clone trooper armor and phase II clone trooper armor . As a result, Imperial armor changes were largely due to production purposes. [13]\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nStar Wars Rebels: \"Art Attack ...

They wear imposing white armor, which offers a wide range of survival equipment and temperature controls to allow the soldiers to survive in almost any environment. Stormtroopers wield blaster rifles and pistols with great skill, and attack in hordes to overwhelm their enemies.

Blast ‘em!”\nA NEW HOPE\nHISTORY //\nTHE DARK TIMES\nAfter the declaration of the Galactic Empire , the clone troopers who’d served the Republic became stormtroopers obeying the will of the Emperor , defeating the Empire’s enemies and enforcing its increasingly oppressive laws. Over time the stormtrooper ranks were filled not by clones but by recruits, trained for blind obedience and fanatical loyalty. On planets such as Lothal , stormtroopers became the face of the Empire, opposed by a brave few who dreamed of restoring freedom to the galaxy.\nGALACTIC CIVIL WAR\nStormtroopers commanded by Darth Vader captured Princess Leia ’s starship and searched for the Death Star plans amid the sands of Tatooine . After discovering droids had the stolen plans, stormtroopers traced them to the Lars farm , where they killed Luke Skywalker ’s aunt and uncle. Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi escaped the Imperial dragnet, but were captured by the Death Star, where stormtroopers hunted the rebel fugitives through the battle station’s endless corridors.\nStormtroopers in cold-weather gear deployed from Imperial AT-AT Walkers and invaded Hoth ’s Echo Base , capturing or killing many rebels but failing to prevent the Millennium Falcon from escaping. After Boba Fett tracked the Falcon to Bespin , stormtroopers captured Han Solo , Princess Leia and Chewbacca and eventually took over Cloud City . After being freed by Lando Calrissian , Leia and Chewie had to escape squads of armed stormtroopers between them and the Falcon.\nThe Empire stationed stormtroopers aboard the second Death Star and ordered them to defend the shield generator protecting the battle station on the surface of Endor . The rebels seeking to destroy the shield generator battled patrols of stormtroopers in scout gear, unaware that an entire legion of troops was defending the Imperial facility. The stormtroopers captured Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca, but were defeated by the unlikeliest of foes: the Forest Moon’s diminutive Ewoks .\nRelated //\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nStormtrooper (Star Wars) ... Same color scheme, ... Its main purpose is for ceremonial stormtrooper sacrifices to bring rain to Tattooine. Stormtrooper (Star Wars) - Uncyclopedia - Wikia Stormtrooper (Star Wars) | Uncyclopedia | Fandom powered by Wikia\nedit Stormtrooper History\nLittle is known about the origins of the stormtroopers, except that they were cloned in the orphan factories of Kamino by the Kaminonannians to serve as the Grand Army of the Republic. Wait, that's more than a little. In fact, there's more.... Because they all looked the same, clone troopers would use facial tattooing and ritual scarification to individuate themselves from one another. Okay, I was completely wrong - a fair amount is known about stormtroopers.\nIt sucks when your job get blown up... twice.\nIn those olden days of the Republic, they were called Clone Troopers and everyone loved them, even the Jedi . Well, droids didn't like them, because clone troopers tended to blow droids up. It was more of a love-hate thing, really, but the droids always came back in the end after they ate a tub of ice cream and had a good cry .\nBut then the Republic became the Empire, and clone troopers became stormtroopers, even though they were still clones and had very little to do with the weather; forecasting tomorrows rain the Jedi's job. I don't know, maybe \"storm\" sounded more fearsome than \"clone.\" Maybe George Lucas was really trying to drive home the symbolic connection between the Galactic Empire and Nazi Germany without really showing a space holocaust. For Christ's sake , this is Uncyclopedia . Clonetroopers aren't even real, it's 1 guy and CGI; the ones in porn are realer than that. Go play Starfox or something, fanboy.\nAt some point in time the Nazis shamelessly stole all of the Stormtroopers' philosophies and genocidal tendencies.  Scientists describe this as being \"a pretty dick move.\"\nedit Stormtroopers in Battle\nHmmm...another Death Star blew up...not good, not good at all. Oh, the Mets won.\nStormtroopers fought in thousands of battles across the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War, and their presence in battle was nothing if not distinctive. Former Rebel Alliance soldier Kyn Griggs, noted one such commonplace instance:\n\"You'd know it was them immediately. You'd be on guard duty, shooting the shit about where in town to find the best prostitutes, whatever, and then there'd be this muffled clinking. You could barely hear it, but you knew what it was. Then there would be this seething, shiny white mass in the distance, and suddenly the air would be thick with blaster bolts. They wouldn't hit anyone, of course, but it was pretty scary the first one or two times. You'd radio base, we'd start our retreat, and you'd just sort of take cover every now and then. Some guys would get hit, accidentally, I think, and then it was off to hyperspace for our next supposedly secret base. You know, I think if we actually stood and fought those guys, we might have won.\"\nThere is precious little explanation how stormtroopers were adept at shooting the crap out of droids during the Clone Wars but woefully inept at shooting slower organic targets during the Galactic Civil War; perhaps some things don't age well. Experts agree that the droids were not as adorable as a rogue smuggler, donut-haired princess, and fresh-faced farmboy, though adorability generally has little bearing on one's \"shootability.\" Recently medical research points to the problem possibly stemming from a rare disorder called Stormtrooper syndrome. Certain theorists claim that because of this effect, the more stormtroopers, and more \"good guys\" there are, the less they can hit. Jedi are veritable death sentences.\nStormtroopers wear distinctive white armor which serves as awesome protection from anything except the most common weapons available to rebels, the laser...shooty...gun-thing (wait, is it really called the \"blaster rifle\"? Yeah, I think it's definitely it), and anyone that can throw a punch, or think they can. Its main purpose is for ceremonial stormtrooper sacrifices to bring rain to Tattooine. Victory in these traditional battles raises your status in the tribe as the chicks adorn you in a funerary mask before being brought to the Jedi pyramids to be sacrificed on their steps to the force. The armour, despite being designed by the galaxy's top weapons manufacturers, had several fatal weaknesses: pointy sticks, rocks , tiny rocks and people who recognize the sad, sad futility in plastic armour.\nedit Stormtroopers in American Society\nMrs. Stormtrooper proves that molded plastic boobs just don't do it for me. Nope.\nIn current American society , stormtroopers serve a far different role than they did in that galaxy a great big distance away in another, distant time. Instead of being feared jackbooted thugs, stormtroopers are outlets for hopeless sci-fi losers to grasp at the respect that has so far eluded them during the course of their normal lives, and to help add that authentic \"fictional\" flavor to Star Wars-themed events and product releases .\nJesse Henry secretly disguised as Jesse Henry .\nThere are even rumors that real, grown-up adults who probably have never served in an actual military unit \"serve\" in various mock units made entirely of mock stormtroopers. Theories abound as to whether these men and women in white have any plans to battle Trekkies or assault Renaissance Festivals in force.\nOf coarse as every fan boy knows female storm troopers are only a feminist and or sexual fantasy; they are non canon in any film ever since the even more revisionist edition made all talking stormroopers Jango Fett still. Kinda makes you wonder why they didn't notice Luke and Han sounded different and wearing different size armor. Come to think about most of the stormtroopers have different size armor, like they were played by actors instead of CGI.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\n'Star Wars Episode VII' actor John Boyega takes aim at 'black Stormtrooper' racism ‘Star Wars Episode VII’ actor John Boyega takes ... - CNN Black Stormtrooper John Boyega to fans: Get used to it - CNN.com\nupdated 12:00 PM EST, Mon December 1, 2014\nSTORY HIGHLIGHTS\nActor John Boyega responds to racism over his \"Star War\" role\nSupporters respond on Twitter with #BlackStormTrooper\nThere have only been a few black characters in Star Wars film history\n(CNN) -- Actor John Boyega has four words for anyone who's upset he's playing what appears to be a black Stormtrooper in the latest \"Star Wars\" film: \"Get used to it.\"\nThe 22-year-old British actor posted the message on Instagram yesterday after his appearance in the new trailer for \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" aroused feverish discussion on social media. On YouTube , some questioned whether a black Stormtrooper made sense, while others reacted with racist remarks.\nSupporters responded on Twitter with the hashtag #BlackStormtrooper .\nActor John Boyega\n\"They'll accept an alien-filled galaxy powered by 'force' but they're not having a black man in uniform?\" tweeted writer Iain Macintosh .\n\"Love how there's \"controversy\" over a #BlackStormtrooper. Even in a galaxy far far away black people exist and can be dynamic characters too,\" tweeted Joseph Oteng .\n\"#BlackStormTrooper better not die first, or I am going to be pissed,\" quipped USC professor Robert Hernandez .\nRace in the 'Star Wars' universe\nDespite the diversity of human and nonhuman characters mingling together in the fictional Star Wars universe, there have been just a handful of prominent black characters. Samuel L. Jackson played Jedi Master Mace Windu in three films, while Billy Dee Williams played Cloud City administrator turned Rebel General Lando Calrissian in two films.\nThe cast of \"Star Wars: Episode VII\" -- or should we say \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" now that the official title has been released -- unites well-known names with some up-and-coming actors. At least one cast member, Daisy Ridley, is so new she has just a few acting credits to her name. You can see her in the back right of this cast photo, wearing a necklace and talking to \"Star Wars\" veteran Carrie Fisher. Here's who she'll star with.\nJohn Boyega is best known for the 2011 sci-fi action comedy \"Attack the Block,\" but now he's known as the guy who steals the spotlight in the \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" trailer. Boyega was long rumored to be a top choice for the lead role.\nActors Pip Andersen, left, and Crystal Clarke were picked from an open casting call to join the movie. Andersen is skilled in the training discipline parkour, and \"The Force Awakens\" will be one of Clarke's first feature films.\nThe rumors about Academy Award-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o joining the cast turned out to be true. In May, she was announced as the newest actress to join the saga. Nyong'o won the best supporting actress Oscar for her breakthrough role in \"12 Years a Slave.\"\nGwendoline Christie, currently known as Brienne of Tarth on HBO's \"Game Of Thrones,\" has also joined \"Star Wars.\" Next year, she will star in \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2\" as Commander Lyme.\nAdam Driver is a multifaceted actor who'll presumably get to show more of his range in \"The Force Awakens.\" While he's best known for playing a quirky love interest on \"Girls,\" Driver has also appeared in feature films \"J. Edgar,\" \"Lincoln,\" \"Frances Ha\" and \"Inside Llewyn Davis.\"\nOscar Isaac had a breakthrough role in 2013 as the cranky singer-songwriter Llewyn Davis in the drama \"Inside Llewyn Davis.\" We can't imagine his work in \"The Force Awakens\" will require him to sing, but it would be awesome if it did; Isaac has proved he's got a great set of pipes.\nAndy Serkis is setting himself up to have a busy few years. The celebrated actor recently appeared in \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" which will be followed by \"The Force Awakens.\" After that, he's expected to appear in another \"Tintin\" movie, \"The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun.\"\nDoes the name Domhnall Gleeson sound familiar? That might be because you remember him as Bill Weasley in the last two movies of the \"Harry Potter\" franchise. But Gleeson has established himself with a host of other projects, including 2010's \"Never Let Me Go\" and 2013's \"About Time.\" Suffice to say that if you don't know Gleeson by now, you will after \"Star Wars: Episode VII.\"\nWhen we learned that the latest \"Star Wars\" installment is supposed to take place 30 years after \"Return of the Jedi\" and feature a trio of newbies alongside some familiar faces, we were ready to bet the house that Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker would be one of the recognizable stars. It was an easy guess to make, though; Hamill has long been considered an unspoken done deal.\nCarrie Fisher was one of the original \"Star Wars\" cast members who initially said she was on board the new movie, only for her rep to backtrack and say the actress was kidding. But Abrams' announcement is no joke: The former Princess Leia has returned.\nAfter playing coy with the press for months, Harrison Ford was finally officially announced as part of the \"The Force Awakens\" cast. The actor is expected to reprise his role of Han Solo.\nWe can't be the only ones who are supremely relieved to see that Anthony Daniels, the voice of C-3PO, will be back in action.\nObviously, you can't have Daniels' C-3PO without Kenny Baker's R2-D2. Just the thought of splitting up the droids is heartbreaking!\nPeter Mayhew is probably somewhere warming up his voice for that famous Chewbacca roar. The actor was rumored to be reprising the character in \"The Force Awakens,\" but it wasn't official until Abrams' announcement.\nMax von Sydow is one of the veteran actors joining the upcoming \"Star Wars\" movie. It isn't clear what the wide-ranging thespian will do in Abrams' picture, but we can rest assured that he'll bring his respected acting chops to the part.\n\"Star Wars\" veteran Warwick Davis is set to return too. He's played multiple roles, but he's best known as Wicket the lead Ewok from \"Return of the Jedi,\" so we suspect he may reprise that role.\nMeet the cast of 'Star Wars: Episode VII'\nJohn Boyega\n>>\nMeet the cast of 'Star Wars: Episode VII'\nJames Earl Jones also provided the legendary voice for Darth Vader, but the actor under the mask was white.\nIn the \"Star Wars\" series Stormtroopers were originally clones of Jango Fett, an ethnic \"Mandalorian\" played by New Zealand-born actor Temuera Derek Morrison, of partial Maori descent. Later in the storyline, when Boyega's \"black Stormtrooper\" character would've lived, Stormtroopers were recruited from general populations -- making a Stormtrooper of any race certainly feasible.\nAs fans continue to dissect the trailer, many have also pointed out Boyega may not even be a Stormtrooper -- he could be a rebel in a Stormtrooper uniform, like Han Solo and Luke Skywalker in \"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.\" Fans will have to wait a bit longer to find out more about Boyega's character.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\nJohn Boyega is untroubled by 'Star Wars' fans who wanted ...
