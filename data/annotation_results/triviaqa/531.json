He is often known as \"the father of television\". Although Baird's electromechanical system was eventually displaced by purely electronic systems (such as those of Vladimir Zworykin, Marconi-EMI, and Philo Farnsworth), Baird's early successes demonstrating working television broadcasts and his color and cinema television work earn him a prominent place in television's invention.\nIn 2002, Logie Baird was ranked number 44 in the BBC's list of the \"100 Greatest Britons\" following a UK-wide vote. In 2006, Logie Baird was also named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history, having been listed in the National Library of Scotland's 'Scottish Science Hall of Fame'. The \"Baird\" brand name was first owned by Thorn-EMI and is now owned and used by the Brighthouse retail chain in the UK as a brand name for its televisions.\nEarly years\nBaird was born at 8am in Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute (then Dunbartonshire) on 13 August 1888, the youngest of four children of the Reverend John Baird, the Church of Scotland's minister for the local St Bride's church and Jessie Morrison Inglis, the orphaned niece of a wealthy family of shipbuilders from Glasgow.\nHe was educated at Larchfield Academy (now part of Lomond School) in Helensburgh; the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College (which later became the University of Strathclyde); and the University of Glasgow. His degree course was interrupted by World War I and he never returned to graduate.\nTelevision experiments\nThe development of television was the result of work by many inventors. Among them, Baird was a prominent pioneer and made major advances in the field. Particularly in Britain, many historians credit Baird with being the first to produce a live, moving, greyscale television image from reflected light. Baird achieved this, where other inventors had failed, by obtaining a better photoelectric cell and improving the signal conditioning from the photocell and the video amplifier.\nBetween 1902 and 1907, Arthur Korn invented and built the first successful signal-conditioning circuits for image transmission. The circuits overcame the image-destroying lag effect that is part of selenium photocells. Korn's compensation circuit allowed him to send still pictures by telephone or wireless between countries and even over oceans, while his circuit operated without benefit of electronic amplification. Korn's success at transmitting halftone still images suggested that such compensation circuits might work in television. Baird was the direct beneficiary of Korn's research and success.\nIn his first attempts to develop a working television system, Baird experimented with the Nipkow disk. Paul Nipkow had invented this scanning disc system in 1884. Television historian Albert Abramson calls Nipkow's patent \"the master television patent\". Nipkow's work is important because Baird and many others chose to develop it into a broadcast medium.\nIn early 1923, and in poor health, Baird moved to 21 Linton Crescent, Hastings, on the south coast of England and later rented a workshop in Queen's Arcade in the town. Baird built what was to become the world's first working television set using items including an old hatbox and a pair of scissors, some darning needles, a few bicycle light lenses, a used tea chest, and sealing wax and glue that he purchased. In February 1924, he demonstrated to the Radio Times that a semi-mechanical analogue television system was possible by transmitting moving silhouette images. In July of the same year, he received a 1000-volt electric shock, but survived with only a burnt hand. His landlord, Mr Tree, asked him to quit his workshop and he moved to upstairs rooms in Soho, London, where he made a technical breakthrough. Baird gave the first public demonstration of moving silhouette images by television at Selfridges department store in London in a three-week series of demonstrations beginning on 25 March 1925.\nIn his laboratory on 2 October 1925, Baird successfully transmitted the first television picture with a greyscale image: the head of a ventriloquist's dummy nicknamed \"Stooky Bill\" in a 30-line vertically scanned image, at five pictures per second. Baird went downstairs and fetched an office worker, 20-year-old William Edward Taynton, to see what a human face would look like, and Taynton became the first person to be televised in a full tonal range. Looking for publicity, Baird visited the Daily Express newspaper to promote his invention. The news editor was terrified: he was quoted by one of his staff as saying: \"For God's sake, go down to reception and get rid of a lunatic who's down there. He says he's got a machine for seeing by wireless! Watch him — he may have a razor on him.\"\nFirst public demonstrations\nOn 26 January 1926, Baird repeated the transmission for members of the Royal Institution and a reporter from The Times in his laboratory at 22 Frith Street in the Soho district of London. By this time, he had improved the scan rate to 12.5 pictures per second. It was the first demonstration of a television system that could broadcast live moving images with tone graduation.\nHe demonstrated the world's first colour transmission on 3 July 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with a filter of a different primary colour; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination. That same year he also demonstrated stereoscopic television.\nIn 1932, Baird was the first person in Britain to demonstrate ultra-short wave transmission. (Today, we refer to \"ultra short waves\" as the VHF band.) Contrary to some reports, these transmissions were far from the first VHF telecasts. In 1931, the US Federal Radio Commission allocated VHF television bands. From 1931 to 1933, station W9XD in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, transmitted some of the first VHF television signals. The station's 45-line, triply interlaced pictures used the U. A. Sanabria television technology.\nBroadcasting\nIn 1927, Baird transmitted a long-distance television signal over 438 miles (705 km) of telephone line between London and Glasgow; Baird transmitted the world's first long-distance television pictures to the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station. This transmission was Baird's response to a 225-mile, long-distance telecast between stations of AT&T Bell Labs. The Bell stations were in New York and Washington, DC. The earlier telecast took place in April 1927, a month before Baird's demonstration.\nBaird then set up the Baird Television Development Company Ltd, which in 1928 made the first transatlantic television transmission, from London to Hartsdale, New York, and the first television programme for the BBC. In November 1929, Baird and Bernard Natan established France's first television company, Télévision-Baird-Natan. He televised the first live transmission of the Epsom Derby in 1931. He demonstrated a theatre television system, with a screen two feet by five feet (60 cm by 150 cm), in 1930 at the London Coliseum, Berlin, Paris, and Stockholm.[20] By 1939 he had improved his theatre projection system to televise a boxing match on a screen 15 ft (4.6 m) by 12 ft (3.7 m).[21]\nFrom 1929 to 1932, the BBC transmitters were used to broadcast television programmes using the 30-line Baird system, and from 1932 to 1935, the BBC also produced the programmes in their own studio at 16 Portland Place. On 3 November 1936, from Alexandra Palace located on the high ground of the north London ridge, the BBC began alternating Baird 240-line transmissions with EMI's electronic scanning system which had recently been improved to 405 lines after a merger with Marconi. The Baird system at the time involved an intermediate film process, where footage was shot on cinefilm which was rapidly developed and scanned. The trial was due to last 6 months but the BBC ceased broadcasts with the Baird system in February 1937, due in part to a disastrous fire in the Baird facilities at Crystal Palace. It was becoming apparent to the BBC that the Baird system would ultimately fail due in large part to the lack of mobility of the Baird system's cameras, with their developer tanks, hoses, and cables.\nBaird's television systems were replaced by the electronic television system developed by the newly formed company EMI-Marconi under Isaac Shoenberg, which had access to patents developed by Vladimir Zworykin and RCA. Similarly, Philo T. Farnsworth's electronic \"Image Dissector\" camera was available to Baird's company via a patent-sharing agreement. However, the Image Dissector camera was found to be lacking in light sensitivity, requiring excessive levels of illumination. Baird used the Farnsworth tubes instead to scan cinefilm, in which capacity they proved serviceable though prone to dropouts and other problems. Farnsworth himself came to London to Baird's Crystal Palace laboratories in 1936, but was unable to fully solve the problem; the fire that burned Crystal Palace to the ground later that year further hampered the Baird company's ability to compete.\nBaird made many contributions to the field of electronic television after mechanical systems had taken a back seat. In 1939, he showed colour television using a cathode ray tube in front of which revolved a disc fitted with colour filters, a method taken up by CBS and RCA in the United States. In 1941, he patented and demonstrated a system of three-dimensional television at a definition of 500 lines. On 16 August 1944, he gave the world's first demonstration of a fully electronic colour television display. His 600-line colour system used triple interlacing, using six scans to build each picture. In 1943, the Hankey Committee was appointed to oversee the resumption of television broadcasts after the war. Baird persuaded them to make plans to adopt his proposed 1000-line Telechrome electronic colour system as the new post-war broadcast standard. The picture quality on this system would have been comparable to today's HDTV (High Definition Television). The Hankey Committee's plan lost all momentum partly due to the challenges of postwar reconstruction. The monochrome 405-line standard remained in place until 1985 in some areas, and it was three decades until the introduction of the 625-line system in 1964 and (PAL) colour in 1967. A demonstration of large screen three-dimensional television by the BBC was reported in March 2008, over 60 years after Baird's demonstration.\nOther inventions\nSome of Baird's early inventions were not fully successful. In his twenties he tried to create diamonds by heating graphite and shorted out Glasgow's electricity supply. Later Baird invented a glass razor which was rust-resistant, but shattered. Inspired by pneumatic tyres he attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but his prototype contained semi-inflated balloons which burst. He also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful. Baird suffered from cold feet, and after a number of trials, he found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth.\nBaird's numerous other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention. He was a visionary and began to dabble with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, but some of the original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer. Baird's other developments were in fibre-optics, radio direction finding, infrared night viewing and radar. There is discussion about his exact contribution to the development of radar, for his wartime defence projects have never been officially acknowledged by the UK government. According to Malcolm Baird, his son, what is known is that in 1926 Baird filed a patent for a device that formed images from reflected radio waves, a device remarkably similar to radar, and that he was in correspondence with the British government at the time. The radar contribution is in dispute. According to some experts, Baird's \"noctovision\" is not radar. Unlike radar (except Doppler radar), Noctovision is incapable of determining the distance to the scanned subject. Noctovision also cannot determine the coordinates of the subject in three-dimensional space.\nLater years\nFrom December 1944 until his death two years later, Baird lived at a house in Station Road, Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, immediately north of the station itself. Baird died in Bexhill on 14 June 1946 after a stroke in February of that year. The old house was demolished in 2007. The Sea Road-Station Road skyline now features a new block of 51 flats on the site, renamed \"Baird Court\".\nJohn Logie Baird is buried with his mother, father and wife in Helensburgh Cemetery.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n... and transmitted.”50 This system was later used by engineer John Logie Baird. ...

Although we tend to think of early TV as being based on the cathode ray tube, there were, during its early development a number of mechanical systems used for relaying pictures before it became possible, due to a lack of contemporary technology, to enable the use of an all-electronic system:\nMechanical TV\nPaul Gottlieb Nipkow\n 1884 Paul Gottlieb Nipkow\ninventors.about.com: “Paul Nipkow (German technician and inventor) developed a rotating-disc technology to transmit pictures over wire in 1884 called the Nipkow disk. (see below) Paul Nipkow was the first person to discover television’s scanning principle, in which the light intensities of small portions of an image are successively analysed and transmitted.”50 This system was later used by engineer John Logie Baird.\nTransmission of still pictures  TV related.\nWiki: “Between 1902 and 1907, Arthur Korn German-born physicist and mathematician invented and built the first successful signal-conditioning circuits for image transmission. The circuits overcame the image-destroying lag effect that is part of selenium photocells. Korn’s compensation circuit allowed him to send still pictures by telephone or wireless between countries and even over oceans, while his circuit operated without benefit of electronic amplification. Korn’s success at transmitting halftone still images suggested that such compensation circuits might work in television. Baird was the direct beneficiary of Korn’s research and success..” 51\nWiki: “He (Korn) pioneered the use of light sensitive selenium cells which took over from the function of the stylus and used a Nernst lamp as a light source. On the 18th October, 1906, he managed to transmit a photograph of Crown Prince William over a distance of 1800 km.” 52\nKorn’s rise to physicist status is somewhat unusual: Wiki: “…He then studied physics and mathematics in Leipzig at the age of 15, from where he graduated in 1890. Afterwards he studied in Berlin, Paris, London and Würzburg. In 1895 he became a lecturer in law at the University of Munich, and was appointed professor in 1903. In 1914 he accepted the chair of physics at the Berlin Institute of Technology.” 53\nA somewhat confusing rise to physicist status.\nBoris Rosing and the Cathode Ray Tube Television\n1907 Electronic-mechanical TV\nBoris Rosing\ninventors.about.com: “Russian scientist Boris Rosing (who worked with Vladimir Zworykin)  used a CRT in the receiver of a television system.” 54\nbairdtelevision.com: “Rosing’s system employed a mirror-drum apparatus as camera and a cathode-ray tube as receiver to transmit black-and-white silhouettes of simple shapes. The cathode-ray tube had been developed a decade earlier by a German, Karl Ferdinand Braun (in 1897). Rosing’s system was primitive, but it was one of the first experimental demonstrations where the cathode ray tube was employed for the purposes of television. Vladimir Zworykin (before emigrating to the U.S.A.) was a student of Rosing and assisted him in some of his laboratory work.” 55\nAlan Archibald Campbell-Swinton\n1908 Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton\ndiscoveriesinmedicine.com: “During the first three decades of the twentieth century, inventors continued to devise uses for cathode ray technology. Inspired by Braun’s oscilloscope, A. A. Campbell-Swinton suggested that a cathode ray tube could be used to project a video image upon a screen. Unfortunately, the technology of the time was unable to match Campbell-Swinton’s vision.” 56\nBut then Wiki tells us: “Engineer Campbell-Swinton’s letter published in the 18 June 1908 issue of Nature was a suggestion rather than any kind of practical invention. Philo T Farnsworthan (See below) was already hard at work on the idea before the letter was sent.” 57\nVladimir Zworykin\n1923 Electro-mechanical TV\nWiki: “Vladimir Zworykin, (not a scientist) Russian-American inventor, engineer, and pioneer of television technology, helped Boris Rosing (a scientist) with experimental work on television in the basement of Rosing’s private lab at the School of Artillery of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Rosing had filed his first patent on a television system in 1907, featuring a very early cathode ray tube as a receiver, and a mechanical device as a transmitter. Its demonstration in 1911, based on an improved design, was among the first demonstrations of TV of any kind. He summarized the resulting invention in two patent applications. The first, entitled “Television Systems”, was filed on December 29, 1923, and was followed by a second application in 1925 of essentially the same content, but with minor changes and the addition of a Paget-type screen for colour transmission and reception. He was awarded a patent for the 1925 application in 1928 and two patents for the 1923 application that was divided in 1931, although the equipment described was never successfully demonstrated.” 58\nCharles Jenkins\n1923 Mechanical TV\n“Charles Jenkins (not a scientist) invented a mechanical television system called radiovision and claimed to have transmitted the earliest moving silhouette images on June 14, 1923.” 59  Wiki: He published an article on “Motion Pictures by Wireless” in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses, and it was June 13, 1925 that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of pictures and sound. He was granted the U.S. patent No. 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on June 30, 1925 (filed on March 13, 1922). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Francis_Jenkins\nNipkow disk\nMechanical TV\ntvhistory.tv: John Logie Baird “On January 23, 1926, John Logie Baird (Scottish engineer and inventor) gave the world’s first public demonstration of a mechanical television apparatus to approximately 40 members of the Royal Institution at his laboratory on Frith Street. These were images of living human faces, not outlines or silhouettes, with complete tonal gradations of light and shade.” 60\nWiki: “In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, but some of the original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer.” 61\nElectronic TV pictures and Kalman Tihanyi\nKalman Tihanyi’s 1926 Patent Application “Radioskop”\nWiki: Hungarian inventor, “Tihanyi called his fully-electronic television system “Radioskop”, and his application contained 42 pages detailing its design and mass production. Though it bears certain similarities to earlier proposals employing a cathode ray tube (CRT) for both transmitter and receiver…\nFrom 1929, Tihanyi worked on television guidance for defence applications, building prototypes of a camera for remotely guided aircraft in London for the British Air Ministry, and later adapting it for the Italian Navy. In 1929, he invented the first infrared-sensitive (night vision) electronic television camera for anti-aircraft defense in Britain.\nTihanyi’s U.S. patents for his display and camera tubes, assigned to RCA, were issued in 1938 and 1939, respectively.\n1936 Tihanyi described the principle of “plasma television” and conceived the first flat-panel television system.” 62  See below for later claims of invention by academics.\nFrom pocket-lint.com: Kalman Tihanyi, a Hungarian engineer, developed the first flat-panel display system in 1963, and about one year later, a monochrome plasma display was invented and presented at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for the PLATO Computer System.\nManufacturers like Ownes-Illinois and Burroughs Corporation made plasma displays, which were known for their neon orange and monochrome look, throughout the 1970s. IBM then popped into the plasma scene in 1983, when it introduced a 19-inch orange-on-black monochrome display.\nColour\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of full-colour plasma displays. Fujitsu demonstrated a 21-inch hybrid display in 1992 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and then three years later, it introduced the first 42-inch plasma display with a 852×480 resolution. http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/131549-farewell-plasma-tv-the-moments-that-defined-flatscreen\nWiki and my own update: “Kalman Tihanyi (28 April 1897, zbg – 26 February 1947, Budapest), was a Hungarian (not a) physicist, (but an) electrical engineer and inventor. One of the early pioneers of electronic television, he made significant contributions to the development of cathode ray tubes (CRTs), which were bought and further developed by the Radio Corporation of America (later RCA),[1][2] and German companies Loewe and Fernseh AG.[citation needed] He invented and designed the world’s first automatic pilotless aircraft in Great Britain.” 63 Why do they keep calling inventors physicists?\nPhilo T. FarnsworthImage Focusing\nPhilo T. Farnsworth 1922, The forgotten inventor\nFrom discoveriesinmedicine.com   “It was not until 1922 that Philo T. Farnsworth used a magnet to focus a stream of electrons onto a screen, producing a crude image. Though the first of its kind, Farnsworth’s invention was quickly superseded by Vladimir Zworykin’s kinescope, the ancestor of the modern television.” 64 The Zworykin kinescope never worked?\nnationalvanguard.org: 1929 “According to the book Philo T. Farnsworth: The Father of Television by Donald G. Godfrey, the first human images transmitted by Farnsworth were of his wife and her brother, Cliff Gardner. A 3 1/2-inch-square image of his wife with her eyes closed was transmitted on October 19, 1929, Gardner wrote. The book lists her as first woman on TV’.\n1957 “Farnsworth an American inventor and television pioneer…predicted HDTV and solid-state flat-screen technology in a 1957 interview: (See Kalman Tihanyi above)\n“[W]e think we can eventually get in excess of 2000 lines instead of 525 and do it on an even narrower channel which will make for a much sharper picture. We believe in the picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display will be just a screen. And we hope for a memory, so that the picture will be just as though its pasted on there.” 65\n“Sadly, credit for his pioneering work was almost taken from Farnsworth when RCA under David Sarnoff, with a potential profit in the hundreds of millions if they prevailed, claimed the innovation was the work of one of its house engineers (Klmn Tihanyi above)?. But in 1935, the courts ruled that Farnsworth was the real inventor…\n…Nevertheless Farnsworth received little recognition or monetary compensation in later years, because of what some say was purposeful revenge by the Jewish establishment for his defeat of Sarnoff. Many scholars also blame Sarnoff for setting back the development of FM radio (see chapter Radio) for decades because it threatened the AM networks and AM receiver technology in which RCA was heavily invested and for thereby causing the suicide of another European-American innovator, Edwin Armstrong, who invented FM radio in 1933” 66\n“At the time he died, Farnsworth held 300 U.S. and foreign patents. His inventions contributed to the development of radar, infra-red night vision devices, the electron microscope, the baby incubator, the gastroscope, and the astronomical telescope.\nWiki: Farnsworth said in an interview, “ And …we hope for a memory, so that the picture will be just as though it’s pasted on there.”” 67  What was required was miniaturised transistor memory technology that did not exist in 1957.\nWiki Talk: There are several good books on Farnsworth’s invention of electronic television. It is very clear that Zworykin visited Farnsworth’s lab under false pretenses, copied his image dissector at RCA, and said he wished he had invented it. Farnsworth’s breakthrough was all his own, and the guys at RCA did everything they could to strip him of the rights and honor due for that. Anyone who wants to contradict that here would well to read one or more of these histories first. Dicklyon 05:59, 12 June 2006 (UTC) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3APhilo_Farnsworth#Old_discussion\nFlat Panel Display Plasma, LED and Liquid Crystal\nWiki: “The first ever flat panel display was invented in 1964 at the University of Illinois. (I don’t think that’s true – see above)\nThe first-ever active-matrix addressed display was made by T Peter Brody’s Thin-Film Devices department at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1968.[4]\nAs of 2012, 50% of global market share in flat panel display (FPD) production is by Taiwanese manufacturers such as AU Optronics and Chimei Innolux Corporation.” 68\nThere is very little information about the invention of flat panel displays, something not unknown in today’s technology.\nWiki: “Burroughs Corporation, a maker of adding machines and computers, developed the Panaplex display in the early 1970s. The Panaplex display, generically referred to as a gas-discharge or gas-plasma display, uses the same technology as later plasma video displays, but began life as seven-segment display for use in adding machines. They became popular for their bright orange luminous look and found nearly ubiquitous use in cash registers, calculators, pinball machines, aircraft avionics such as radios, navigational instruments, and stormscopes; test equipment such as frequency counters and multimeters; and generally anything that previously used nixie tube or numitron displays with a high digit-count throughout the late 1970s and into the 1990s. These displays remained popular until LEDs gained popularity because of their low-current draw and module-flexibility, but are still found in some applications where their high-brightness is desired, such as pinball machines and avionics. Pinball displays started with six- and seven-digit seven-segment displays and later evolved into 16-segment alphanumeric displays, and later into 128×32 dot-matrix displays in 1990, which are still used today. ” 69\nIf Tihanyi described the principle of plasma television and conceived the first flat-panel television system in 1936 and Farnsworth predicted HDTV and solid-state flat-screen technology in a 1957, the principles must already have been known. How can the “first ever flat panel” have been “invented at the University of Illinois in 1964”? Prevarications from the halls of academe. 70\nEarly LED history\nFrom radio-electronics.com: The first recorded effects of the light emitting diode effect were noticed back at the beginning of the twentieth century. A British engineer named H J Round working for Marconi was undertaking some experiments using crystal detectors. At the time radio detectors were one of the major limiting factors within the early wireless of radio sets.\nThe early detectors were often made by using a small piece of material – we would now know them as forms of semiconductor – and placing a small wire onto the surface. These were called “Cat’s Whiskers” for obvious reasons. In trying to investigate the effects and improve their performance, Round had passed a current through some of his detectors. He noted that one of them emitted light when a current was passed through it. Although he did not understand the mechanism for the effect, he published his findings in 1907 in a magazine of the day named Electrical World. http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/semicond/leds-light-emitting-diodes/history.php\nTo the Editors of Electrical World:\nSIRS: – During an investigation of the unsymmetrical passage of current through a contact of carborundum and other substances a curious phenomenon was noted. On applying a potential of 10 volts between two points on a crystal of carborundum, the crystal gave out a yellowish light. Only one or two specimens could be found which gave a bright glow on such a low voltage, but with 110 volts a large number could be found to glow. In some crystals only edges gave the light and others gave instead of a yellow light green, orange or blue. In all cases tested the glow appears to come from the negative pole, a bright blue-green spark appearing at the positive pole. In a single crystal, if contact is made near the center with the negative pole, and the positive pole is put in contact at any other place, only one section of the crystal will glow and that same section wherever the positive pole is placed.\nThere seems to be some connection between the above effect and the e.m.f. produced by a junction of carborundum and another conductor when heated by a direct or alternating current; but the connection may be only secondary as an obvious explanation of the e.m.f. effect is the thermoelectric one. The writer would be glad of references to any published account of an investigation of this or any allied phenomena.\nNew York, N. Y.\nH. J.
