Chihuahua - Mexico - HISTORY.com Chihuahua - Mexico - HISTORY.com\nChihuahua\nA+E Networks\nIntroduction\nThe largest state in Mexico, Chihuahua is headquarters for the world’s fifth largest oil company, Pertróleos Mexicanos. It is also where one of the smallest canine breeds, the Chihuahua, originated. After railroad travel to the Copper Canyon area was upgraded following privatization of the railroad in 1998, tourism became an important and growing segment of the economy. Attractions include the beautiful Copper Canyon region and Pancho Villa’s mansion.\nHistory\nEarly History\nWhen the Spanish first arrived in Chihuahua, more than 200 indigenous groups, including Native Americans, already inhabited the area. Although little of this period’s history is recorded, archeologists have found evidence of inhabitants dating as far back as 3,000 years. Some of these tribes include the Tarahumara (Raramuri), Apache, Comanche and Guarojío. For several thousand years, indigenous groups living in Chihuahua maintained trading relations with groups in other areas. Perhaps the most notable inhabitants were the Tarahumara (Raramuri), a people whose rich spiritual ideology, passive resistance and strong cultural identity enabled them to persevere despite foreign intrusions. Other tribes, like the warlike Apache, were overwhelmed and eventually assimilated after the arrival of the Spaniards.\nDid You Know?\nDuring the Mexican Revolution,Chihuahua was a central battleground. Peasant revolutionary leader Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa fought throughout Chihuahua, demanding that the peasants be apportioned land and be recognized as legitimate participants in Mexican politics. Villa’s famous Northern Division was first assembled in Chihuahua.\nMiddle History\nÁlvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca was the first Spaniard to visit the area. His expedition spanned the territory between Florida in the United States and the Mexican state of Sinaloa .\nAs early as 1567, silver mines were established in Santa Barbara, a region occupied by the Conchos Indians. Many Spaniards poured into the region, forcing the indigenous population to work the mines.\nThroughout the 16th century, the first Spanish settlements were established around haciendas (country estates) and mining operations. Some Franciscan missions and Carapoa villages were also founded in the mid-1500s. Although the military garrisons at El Paso and Ciudad Juárez were both built in 1598, the Spanish colonizers exerted fairly loose control over the region during most of the 16th century.\nWith the mining industry growing steadily into the 17th century, Chihuahua was named the capital of the province of Nueva Vizcaya. From 1640 to 1731, the area experienced increased economic activity and, concomitantly, frequent indigenous uprisings. Tensions developed between the miners and the hacienda owners who continued to force indigenous groups into slavery.\nRecent History\nIn the Mexican War of Independence, Chihuahua hacienda owners and miners sided with the royalist forces against the independence movement. However, Mexico’s independence in 1821 forced leaders in Chihuahua to join the new country. The 1821 Plan of Iguala established the framework that consolidated the new republic; later, the region of Durango separated from Chihuahua and became an autonomous province. Chihuahua officially became a Mexican state in 1824; the state constitution was ratified the following year.\nIn 1830, an ethnic war broke out in Chihuahua that nearly exterminated the indigenous Apache and Comanche tribes.\nDuring the Mexican Revolution , which began in 1910, Chihuahua was again a central battleground. Peasant revolutionary leader Francisco “Pancho” Villa fought throughout Chihuahua, demanding that the peasants be apportioned land and be recognized as legitimate participants in Mexican politics. Villa’s famous Northern Division was first assembled in Chihuahua.\nFollowing the revolution, Chihuahua remained a hub of Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) influence. Because of its proximity to the United States, Chihuahua was strategically important to Mexico . The region was also central to the oldest and most important opposition party during PRI rule, the National Action Party (PAN). State leader Luis H. Álvarez became the PAN presidential candidate in 1958 after an unsuccessful run for governor. In 1992, Chihuahua became one of the first states in Mexico to elect a governor who was not a member of the PRI.\nIn 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), designed to encourage trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico by eliminating tariffs and lifting many restrictions on various categories of trade goods, went into effect. Because Chihuahua shares a border with the United States, the state experienced tremendous economic growth as a result of the treaty. However, small farmers found that participation in the well-established and competitive North American market was quite difficult.\nChihuahua Today\nSince the advent of NAFTA in 1994, relations between Chihuahuan management and labor have been strained. Union membership has declined, and much of the state’s labor force has resisted the implementation of the agreement. Nevertheless, Chihuahua continues to have one of the fastest-growing economies in Mexico.\nToday, the primary economic drivers in the state are assembly plants (called maquiladoras) that produce electronic components, automobile parts and textile goods. Manufacturers such as Toshiba, JVC and Honeywell have facilities in the state’s recently developed industrial parks.\nTimber production and livestock ranching in Chihuahua were once staples of the economy; however, as of 2003, they represented less than 10 percent of the total economic activity.\nFacts & Figures\nMajor Cities (population): Juárez (1,313,338) Chihuahua (758,791) Cuauhtémoc (134,785) Delicias (127,211) Hidalgo del Parral (103,519)\nSize/Area: 94,571 square miles\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nThe Chihuahua is a tiny toy sized dog. ... where it received its name from the Mexican State of Chihuahua. ...

Chihuahua Dog Breed Information and Pictures Chihuahua Dog Breed Information and Pictures\nYour browser does not support the audio tag.\nDescription\nThe Chihuahua is a tiny toy sized dog. The body is longer than it is tall. The head is well-rounded, apple in shape and the muzzle is short and pointed with a well-defined stop. Puppies have a soft spot on the top of the skull called a \"molera,\" which usually closes by adulthood. The large, round eyes are set well apart and are dark, ruby, and may be lighter in white dogs. The erect ears are large. Dewclaws may be removed. The tail is long, sickle-shaped and either curled over the back or to the side. The coat can be short, long and wavy or flat. All colors, both solid, marked or splashed are accepted. Colors include, but are not limited to, black, white, chestnut, fawn, sand, silver, sable, steel blue, black & tan and parti-color.\nTemperament\nThe Chihuahua is a good companion dog. Courageous, extremely lively, proud and adventurous, they enjoy affection. Brave, cheerful and agile, Chihuahuas can be strong-willed without proper human leadership. They are loyal and become attached to their owners. Some like to lick their owner's faces. Socialize them well . For some, they may be slightly difficult to train, but they are intelligent, learn quickly, and respond well to proper, firm but gentle (positive reinforcement) training. May be difficult to housebreak . Do not let the Chihuahua get away with things you would not allow a large dog to do ( Small Dog Syndrome ), such as jumping up on humans . While it may be cute for a 5-pound tiny dog to put his paws on your leg when you come home from work, it is allowing a dominant behavior. If you allow this little dog to be your pack leader it will develop many behavior issues such as jealousy, aggression with other dogs and sometimes with humans, and will become undeniably suspicious of people except for its owner. When strangers are present, it will begin to follow its owner's every move, keeping as close as possible. A Chihuahua that is pack leader of its humans may snap at children. This breed is generally not recommended for children, not because it is not good with them, but because most people treat the Chihuahua differently than they would a large dog, causing it to become untrustworthy. Because of its size, this breed tends to be babied and things we humans clearly see as bad behavior for a large dog are looked over as cute with a small dog. Small dogs also tend to be walked less , as humans assume they get enough exercise just running around during the day. However, a walk provides more than just exercise. It provides mental stimulation and satisfies the migration instinct all dogs have. Because of this, small breeds such as the Chihuahua tend to become snappish, yappy, protective and untrustworthy with kids and humans they do not know. Chihuahuas that are their human's pack leader tend to be fairly dog-aggressive. An owner who realizes this and treats the Chihuahua no differently than they would a large breed, becoming a clear pack leader, will get a different, more appealing temperament out of this wonderful little dog, finding it to be a good little child companion.\nHeight, Weight\nHeight: 6 - 9 inches (15 - 23 cm)\nWeight: 2 - 6 pounds (1-3 kg)\nHealth Problems\nProne to rheumatism, slipped stifle, colds and gum problems. Also corneal dryness and secondary glaucoma, due to their protruding eyes. Gains weight easily. Take caution around toxic products such as chocolate or fertilizer. This is a very small breed and it will not take much to poison them. Chihuahuas are often born via cesarean section because puppies are born with relatively large heads. Susceptible to fractures and other accidents in puppyhood. Some Chihuahuas have a molera, an unclosed section of the skull which can remain open throughout life. This makes the dog prone to injury. Has a tendency to wheeze and snore because of their small, short muzzles. Prone to stress, caused by the owners tendency to treat them like little babies. All dogs, even tiny ones, need to feel their owners are strong-minded beings able to handle the entire pack.\nA disease that seems to be increasing among Chihuahuas is GME, which stands for Granulomatous Meningoencephalitis. It is becoming more frequent among the apple head Chis. It is, at this time, a very poorly understood central nervous system disease that suddenly strikes without much warning. It comes in three types: focal (lesions in the brain or spine); multifocal (lesions in both brain and spine as well as eyes); and optical (causing blindness. There are several current methods of treating it currently and which continue to be updated as more research is done. While there are methods of controlling it in those dogs who survive the first two weeks, unfortunately, there is no true cure. It can go into remission, sometimes for years, but can always resurface.  The medications, testing, etc. in the beginning in order to properly diagnose, the cost is in the thousands and many, many more thousands will need to be spent over the remaining years of the dog's life.  While GME occurs in many other breeds (generally the toy breeds though there are some others, there is a tremendous number of Chihuahuas with it. Interestingly, deer head Chihuahua's do not tend to be prone to GME, only the apple-head type.\nLiving Conditions\nThey are good little dogs for apartment life. The Chihuahua likes warm weather and dislikes the cold. They need space just like any other dog. Because they are small does not mean they can be kept in a very small area.\nExercise\nAlthough it is tempting to carry these dainty creatures about, these are active little dogs that need a daily walk . Play can take care of a lot of their exercise needs, however, as with all breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs that do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to display a wide array of behavior problems , as well as neurotic issues. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off lead, such as a large, fenced-in yard.\nLife Expectancy\nAbout 15 or more years.\nlitter Size\nAbout 1 to 3 puppies\nGrooming\nThe smooth, shorthaired coat should be gently brushed occasionally or simply wiped over with a damp cloth. The long coat should be brushed daily with a soft bristle brush. Bathe both types about once per month, taking care not to get water in the ears. Check the ears regularly and keep the nails trimmed. This breed is an average shedder.\nOrigin\nThis is the oldest breed on the American continent and the smallest breed in the world. Native to Mexico, where it received its name from the Mexican State of Chihuahua. It was only brought to Europe at the end of the nineteenth century. The breeds that were used to make up the Chihuahua are unclear, but some think it originated from the Fennec Fox. The dogs were sacred to Pre-Columbian Indian nations and were also popular pets to the upper class. The dogs are prized for their size and are most valued to some fanciers when they weigh under 2-1/4 pounds (1.3 kg).\nGroup\nACA = American Canine Association Inc.\nACR = American Canine Registry\nAPRI = American Pet Registry, Inc.\nANKC = Australian National Kennel Club\nCKC = Canadian Kennel Club\nDRA = Dog Registry of America, Inc.\nFCI = Fédération Cynologique Internationale\nKCGB = Kennel Club of Great Britain\nNAPR = North American Purebred Registry, Inc.\nNKC = National Kennel Club\nNZKC = New Zealand Kennel Club\nUKC = United Kennel Club\n\"We got Stoli (right) 3 years ago when we were in college back east at UNC. The first picture is her at 7 weeks old. She is a short-coat fawn with black sable. As she grew older the black sable faded and she is almost completely fawn except for the black stripe on her tail. We had to work hard to keep her from getting \" small dog syndrome , \" which makes many toy breeds yappy and disliked by strangers. She bonded with many friends and family members and I took her to class with me and on the bus. I even took her babysitting with me and she now LOVES kids which is not a common trait in small dogs. Because of our hard work to treat her like a dog and not a fragile little toy she is very well behaved and not terrified of people and new surroundings. She also knows over 15 tricks and loves to perform! Stoli is 3.8 pounds and almost 3 years old. Just over a month ago we decided to get a playmate for Stoli that was her own size. This first picture is Roxi at 8 weeks and 15 ounces. She is a longhaired Chihuahua and should get up to 3-3.5 pounds as an adult. Her full long hair will not mature until she is around 1 1/2 years old, and in the meantime she will go through \"puppy uglies\" which is the awkward teenager stage for long-coated breeds between their puppy and adult coats. Her color is technically black and tan with a partial white collar and white feet. She also has merle markings that give the spotted blue and black pattern to her coat. The merle gene leeches out the most of the color from the black part of her coat leaving the grey/blue areas. It has also affected her eye color, which is marbled blue and brown. The merle Chihuahua is banned from some organizations around the world, but the AKC still allows for it in the show ring. The reason for this is possible health concerns associated with the gene. But we love little Roxi to death and she is completely healthy and growing fast! Walking around town with these two we get stopped constantly to be asked what kind of dogs they are and to tell us how cute they are. Recently we have been hearing kids yell out \"Mommy look they are from Beverly Hills!\" due to the new Disney movie.\"\n\"These are our Chi babies, from left: Maxwell (6 months), Milo (9 months) and Matilda (also 9 months). While Milo and Matilda are on the bigger side of the Chi scale at 7 and 9 lbs., Maxwell is on the more average size at about 4½ lbs. Milo is a bit more on the lazy side compared to the other two and sometimes will just sit and watch the others play. He is also a bit insecure which we are working on with him. They are all very loving however and are always anxious to share kisses with their humans and with each other alike. Sometimes they'll lie in the sun bathing each other’s faces and making sure they are all looking their best. Then they will burrow in blankets, pillows, etc. until they fluff it up just enough to get comfortable and then proceed to take a long nap. While none of them are the \" alpha \" (that's the humans job, isn't it?!) our female, Matilda is by far the most bossy out of the group. If she wants to play, you'd better play or else you'll get a \"donkey kick\" until she gets a reaction. Typical female! (and yes, I can say that because I AM a female! :o)\n\"I was always a big-dog person and really was never fond of little dogs .  However, when wanting a new addition to our home, I did my breed research and found the Chihuahua to best suit my wants in a dog. Apparently they surpassed my expectations as we went from one to three Chihuahua's in 3 short months with absolutely no regrets.\n\"I have been watching Cesar Millan's shows for a couple months now and have started to use a lot of his techniques. While my puppies are still young and are a work in progress as most are, I think using these techniques will help them become balanced adults. Of course, the more I watch, the more I learn so I am also a \" pack leader work in progress.\" My pups are already great minding as a result and as an example of that as you can see they are easily \"pose-able\" for photographs. :o)\"\n\"Jasper is a 9-week-old blue merle Chihuahua weighing 1.4lbs. He's a tiny terror, but an overall good boy.\"\n\"Monkey is a 10-week-old Chihuahua. She got her name Monkey because she climbs on my shoulders all the time and adores bananas, so I thought 'Monkey' really fit her. She is very, very playful and is a joy to have. She is completely pad trained now and knows sit !  She lives with 2 adults, 2 teenagers (15 and 16) and 2 little kids (7 and 11) and she loves everyone. But, is very attached to me (I'm 16). Monkey is estimated to weigh about 3 lbs. full grown. She is extremely smart and has great manners, surprisingly. Monkey is for sure a lapdog and follows me around everywhere!! Loves car rides and is very well socialized .  I've watched Cesar Millan for about 3 years now and have read his book. He's amazing and has taught me so much about dog psychology, he is truly my idol. Monkey is a well-balanced dog and I taught her young not to have the mind set to walk all over me or try to control me in any way. Though she is spoiled rotten, she knows who is boss . I could not imagine my life without my little Monkey and have lots of years to look forward to. I will ONLY have Chihuahuas; they are an amazing breed and truly a joy to have!!\"\n\"This is our 8-month-old, 4.5-lb. Chihuahua Tequila. We call her Tiqi as a nickname and we love her to death. She's very energetic and I'm glad to see your site lists that they should be walked daily .  Lots of people think that because she's so little, she doesn't need it, but her behavior is so much better when she's been exercised. She's very social and believes that any person she sees is there for the sole benefit of petting her. She's never learned to bark, which is fine for us. She does well with other dogs and children and is very smart! We were able to teach her to sit, shake with both her right and left paws, and 'walk pretty' in one week! This is her getting ready for bed in her PJ's.\"\nThis is Boo, a shorthaired all-black Chihuahua at 1 year old, weighing 6 pounds. Solid black is not a very common color in the Chihuahua breed.\nChihuahua puppy\n\"Blondie, our Chihuahua is 9 years old and has been riding with us for 5 of those years. Blondie has ridden over 1000 miles. We take her with us on long trips. If we stop to eat she has a bag she sits in quietly while we eat (of course food is snuck into the bag for her). She is the most amazing dog I have ever owned. She loves to be with us wherever we go. I make leather riding pouches and leather outfits for dogs. I sell them at motorcycle rallies and she is a great model. The picture I'm sending in was taken by our friend we were on our way to ride the Bonnie and Clyde ride in Louisiana. My dog is a balanced dog. In fact, we watch Cesar on a regular basis. On one of his episodes he was helping a couple in California get their dog, a Jack Russell, to ride. In the beginning of that episode the dog is wearing one of my outfits that was purchased on eBay. By the way, I am a dog groomer so she gets to go to work with me every day.\"\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nBeverly Hills Chihuahua .

Chihuahua Mexico | All about Chihuahua | Official Visitor ... Chihuahua Mexico | All about Chihuahua | Official Visitor Guide Chihuahua Online\nWelcome to Chihuahua in Mexico!\nChihuahua is one of the 31 states which, with the Federal District, comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. Its capital city is Chihuahua. Chihuahua is located in Northwestern Mexico . It is bordered by the states of Sonora to the west, Sinaloa to the southwest, Durango to the south, and Coahuila to the east. Chihuahua is just one of over 60 official online guides covering the whole of Mexico. If you´re planning a trip to Mexico and would like discover our fabulous nation before visiting or, if you´d like to visit a specific place in Mexico, then you´ve come to the right place. To the north and northeast, it has a long desolate area with the U.S. Mexico border across from the U.S. states of New Mexico and Texas. Chihuahua is the largest state in Mexico by land mass, with a mainland area of 247,455 square kilometers (95,543 sq mi); it is slightly larger than the UK. It is consequently known under the nickname The Big State or El Estado Grande in Spanish.\nAlthough Chihuahua is primarily identified with the Chihuahuan Desert for namesake, it has more forests areas than any other state in Mexico. Due to its alternative climate the state has a large variety of fauna and flora. Chihuahua is one of Mexico´s most popular places, visited by millions of people over the last decade. When you travel to Chihuahua you may wish to check out the Chihuahua hotels we have available or maybe you´d like to rent a car in Chihuahua ? We also offer extensive day trips in Chihuahua . This unique place has simply amazing. We´ve also compiled a list of Travel books on Chihuahua Mexico.\nThe state is mostly characterized by rugged mountainous terrain and wide river valleys. The Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, an extension of the Rocky Mountains, dominates the state’s terrain and is home to the state’s greatest attraction, Las Barrancas del Cobre, or Copper Canyon, a canyon system larger and deeper than the Grand Canyon. On the slope of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains (near the regions of Casas Grandes, Cuauhtémoc and Parral), there are vast prairies of yellow grass, which is the source of the bulk of the state’s agricultural production. Most of the inhabitants live along the Rio Grande Valley and the Conchos River Valley of the state.\nWhether you are visiting Chihuahua in Mexico for business, pleasure or both, we´re sure that Chihuahua will meet all of your expectations and that the people of Chihuahua will make you feel welcome while sampling some of the unique cuisine on offer in the Chihuahua Restaurant districts.\nChihuahua Ecotourism\nThe main mountain range in the state is the Sierra Madre Occidental reaching a maximum altitude of 10,826 ft (3,300 m) known as Cerro Mohinora. Mountains make up for one third of the state’s surface area which includes large coniferous forests.\nThe climate in the mountainous regions varies Chihuahua has more forests than any other state in Mexico, making the area a bountiful source of wood; the mountainous areas are rich in minerals central to Mexico’s mining industry. Rainfall and temperature in the mountainous areas depends on the elevation. Unusually for Mexico, between the months of November and March snow storms are possible in the lower elevations and are frequent in the higher elevations. There are several watersheds located in the Sierra Madre Occidental all of the water that flows through the state; most of the rivers finally pour into the Rio Grande. Temperatures in some canyons in the state reach over 100°F in the summer while the same areas rarely drop below 32°F in the winter. Many microclimates are found in the heart of the Sierra Madre Occidental in the state that could be considered tropical and there have been wild tropical plants found in some canyons.\nLa Barranca del Cobre, or Copper Canyon, a spectacular canyon system larger and deeper than the Grand Canyon; the canyon also contains Mexico’s two tallest waterfalls:\nBasaseachic Falls and Piedra Volada. Furthermore, there are two national parks found in the mountainous area of the state: Cumbres de Majalca National Park and Basaseachic Falls National Park, making the states very attractive for national and foreign tourism.\nThe plains at the foot of the Sierra Madre Occidental is an elongated mesa known as Altiplanicie Mexicana that exhibits a steppe climate and serves as a transition zone from the mountain climate in the western part of the state to the desert climate in the eastern side of the state.\nChihuahua Landscape Contrasts\nChihuahua has a Subtropical climate which is most common at elevations between 4,200-7,200 ft above sea level; this climate zone has warm humid summers and an average summer temperature of 68°F. The summer average precipitation is 70 cm (28 in) mostly in the months of: July, August, and September.\nFrom November to March there are many rainstorms and snowstorms caused by high elevation and prominent cold fronts. Winter temperatures can reach a low of 3°F.\nChihuahua has a semi-arid climate or prairieland which is most common at elevations between 4,000-5,000 ft above sea level; this climate zone has an annual average 64°F and maximum temperatures above of 100°F and lows reaching slightly below 32°F, with a wet season in the late summer and fall. Snowfall is infrequent but does happen from time to time in the winter and frost is common from December to March. The annual average rainfall in the steppe climate zone is about 18.7 inches.\nThe main Hot Desert in Chihuahua is most common at elevations below 4,000 ft (1,200 m) above sea level; this climate zone tends to have a hot summer at temperatures that often reach 110 °F. Winter is warm, rarely dropping below 32°F. Precipitation averages between 6-10 in per year; most of the moisture falls during the “monsoon” of late summer.\nThen the Cool Desert in Chihuahua is most common at elevations below 4,000 ft (1,200 m) above sea level; this climate zone tends to have a mild summer, rarely reaching temperatures over 105 °F. Winter weather varies from mild to cold depending on northern fronts, often dropping below 32°F. Precipitation averages between 10-16 in per year; most of the moisture falls during the “monsoon” of at the end of the summer months.\nChihuahua topography\nThe largest river in the state is Rio Conchos which is the largest tributary to the Rio Grande from the Mexican side; the river descends from the zenith of the Sierra Madre Occidental in the southwest part of the state and winds through the center of the state where the water is exploited in the steppe zone and it eventually empties into the Rio Grande in the small desert town of Ojinaga.\nThe desert area also accounts for about a third of the state’s surface area. The Chihuahuan Desert is an international biome that also extends into the neighboring Mexican state of Coahuila and into the US states of Texas and New Mexico. The desert zone is mainly of flat topography with some small mountain ranges that run north to south. The desert in the state varies slightly with a small variant in climate. The lower elevations of the desert zone are found in the north along the Rio Grande which experience hotter temperatures in the summer and winter while the southern portion of the desert zone experiences cooler temperatures due to its higher elevation. Better known as the Samalayuca dunes they cover an area of about 150 square kilometers; it is an impressive site of the Chihuahuan Desert and is a protected area by the state due to unique species of plants and animals that can only be found in that area.\nThe climate in the state depends mainly in the elevation of the terrain. The Sierra Madre Occidental dominates the western part of the state; there are two main climates in this area: Subtropical Highland and Humid Subtropical. There are some microclimates in the state due to the varying topology mostly found in the western side of the state. The two best known microclimates are: Tropical savanna climate in deep canyons located in the extreme southern part of the state; Continental Mediterranean climate in the extremely high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental.\nVegetation is much greener in the west because of the cooler temperatures and larger amounts of precipitation as compared to the rest of the state.\nChihuahua Economy\nChihuahua has a comprehensive and diverse state economy. The three most important economic centers in the state are: Ciudad Juarez, an international manufacturing center; Chihuahua, the state capital; and Delicias which is the state’s main agriculture hub. Today Chihuahua serves as an important commercial route prospering from billions of dollars from international trade as a result of the NAFTA agreement with the United States .\nChihuahua Desert Regions\nIn the extreme eastern part of the state the Chihuahuan Desert dominates due to low rainfall and extremely high temperatures; some areas of the eastern part of the state are so dry no vegetation is found like the Sand Dunes of Samalayuca.\nThere are two distinctive climate zones found in the eastern part of the state: Hot Desert and Cool Desert which are differentiated by average annual temperature due to differences in elevation. There is a transition zone in the middle of the state between the two extremely different climates from the east and west; this zone is the Steppe characterized by a compromise between juxtaposed climate zones.\nOddly, the Chihuahuan Desert varies slightly from cool in higher terrain to hot in low elevations. Subtropical Highland most common at elevations above 7,200 ft (2,200 m) above sea level; this climate zone has warm summers reaching a maximum temperature of 82°F and summer lows of 50°F. Heavy rainstorms are observed from July to September. Winters are cold reaching a maximum low of -4°F and a maximum high of 17°F. During the winter months many snowstorms are observed with typically 1 meter (3 ft) of snow per season.\nChihuahua Climate\nNamurachi Canyon is characterized by many caves near the town of San Francisco de Borja.\nThe grassland area accounts for a third of the state’s area, and it experiences pronounced dry and wet seasons. The pronounced rainy season in the steppe is usually observed in the months of July, August, and September. The steppe also encounters extreme temperatures that often reach over 100°F in the summer and drop below 32°F in the winter. The prairieland zone is an important agriculture zone due to an extensive development of canals exploiting several rivers that flow down from the mountains. Therefore, the grassland zone is the most populated area of the state.\nChihuahua Geography\nThe state of Chihuahua is the largest state in the country and is known as El Estado Grande (The Big State); it accounts for 12.6% of the land of Mexico. The state landlocked by the states of Sonora to the west, Sinaloa to the south-west, Durango to the south, and Coahuila to the east, and by the U.S. states of Texas to the north-east and New Mexico to the north. The state is made up of three geologic regions: Mountains, Plains-Valleys, and Desert which occur in large bands from west to east. Because of the different geologic regions there are distinct climates and ecosystems.\nWhy the name Chihuahua?\nWhile most people associate the name most with a bread of dog from the K9 family, the origin of the name Chihuahua has long been disputed by historians and linguists.\nThe most established theory explains that the name was derived from the Nahuatl language meaning “The place where the water of the rivers meet” although other theories exist.\nTravelucion Guide Mexico Chihuahua | Free Guide Mexico\nChihuahua is just one of the websites Travelucion operates and is part of over 800 travel websites for over 130 countries worldwide.

History of Mexico - The State of Chihuahua - Houston Institute History of Mexico - The State of Chihuahua\nHISTORY OF MEXICO\nINDIGENOUS CHIHUAHUA: A STORY OF WAR AND ASSIMILATION\nBy John P. Schmal\nSeveral million Americans look to the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua as their ancestral homeland. Chihuahua - with a total of 245,945 square kilometers within its boundaries - is the largest state of the Mexican Republic and occupies 12.6% of the national territory. In stark contrast, Chihuahua's population - 3,052,907 residents in the 2000 census - amounts to only 3.13% of the national population.\nMORE RESOURCES\nMexican Traditions\n \n  An understanding of Chihuahua's indigenous inhabitants from the pre-Hispanic era to the Nineteenth Century requires an imagination that dispenses with national borders. The border of the present-day state of Chihuahua with its neighboring Mexican states and the American states on its north is a creation of political entities. These borders may cause the reader to believe that the indigenous groups from Chihuahua were unique to their area and distinct from the indigenous inhabitants of New Mexico, Texas, Coahuila, Sonora, or Durango.\nHowever, nothing could be further from the truth. Although an international border separates Chihuahua from Texas and New Mexico, the indigenous inhabitants of Chihuahua did in fact have extensive cultural, linguistic, economic and spiritual ties with the indigenous groups of those two American states. For several thousand years, indigenous groups living in Chihuahua have had trading relations with indigenous groups located in other areas. And many of the Chihuahua Amerindians do in fact share common roots with the Native Americans of New Mexico and Texas.  And, up until the last part of the Nineteenth Century, the border of Chihuahua and the United States was a meaningless line in the sand, across which Apaches, Comanches and other groups freely passed.\nIf you are from Chihuahua, it is likely that you have both indigenous and European ancestors because this frontier region represented both a melting pot and a battleground to the many people who have inhabited it during the last five centuries. Spanish explorers started exploring the region of Chihuahua (which was part of the Spanish province of Nueva Vizcaya) in the mid-Sixteenth Century, especially after the discovery of the Santa Barbara mines in 1567.\nAs they made their way through the Western Sierra Madre highlands and the deserts of Bolsón de Mapimí, the Spanish explorers found a wide range of nomadic and semi-nomadic indigenous groups. Some of the indigenous groups were named by different explorers at different times and, as a result, carried two or three names. Anyone who is studying the indigenous groups of Chihuahua may at first find this somewhat confusing.\nThe Concho Indians lived near the junction of the Río Concho River and Río Grande Rivers in northern Chihuahua. This region - known as La Junta de los Ríos - is a historic farming and trading area. The present-day towns of Presidio (Texas) and Ojinaga (Chihuahua) lay at the center of this region. The Conchos was named for the Spanish word \"shells,\" most likely a reference to the many shellfish they found in the Conchos River. The Conchos - at an early period - cooperated with and allied themselves with the Spaniards, although on a few occasions they also fought against them.\nThe Toboso Indians lived in the Bolsón de Mapimí region. Living in parts of both Coahuila and Chihuahua, the Tobosos frequently raided Spanish settlements and posed a serious problem during the Seventeenth Century. The Jumanos who inhabited the La Junta area along the R�o Grande River above the Big Bend engaged in agriculture, growing a wide range of crops, including corn, squash, figs, beans, pumpkins and melons.\nThe Suma Indians lived in the vicinity of present-day El Paso and through parts of northwestern Chihuahua and northeastern Sonora. The Suma Indians joined some of the missions that the Spanish missionaries set up during the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. The Sumas eventually declined and disappeared, mostly as a result of the assimilation and mestizaje that took place in the Spanish-sponsored settlements in Chihuahua.\nThe Pescado Indians - named for the Spanish word for fish - lived along the Río Grande along northern border of Chihuahua and in parts of Texas. At some point, they were absorbed by other Indian groups and the Spanish settlers that moved northward into their tribal lands. The Mansos Indians also lived near present-day El Paso along the Río Grande border area. In 1659 Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe Mission was established by Spanish missionaries for the Manso Indians living near present-day Ciudad Juárez.\nThe Coahuiltecan tribes roamed through parts of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León and most of Texas west of San Antonio River and Cibolo Creek. These Indians consisted of countless small nomadic bands, each of which was given different names by different explorers. Little is known about the linguistic affinity or the cultures of the Coahuiltecan Indians because they eventually disappeared, having been decimated by war, disease or assimilation, at the hands of the Europeans, Comanches, and Apaches.\nThe Tarahumara Indians who inhabited southern Chihuahua belonged to the Uto-Aztecan Linguistic Family and originally occupied more than 28,000 square miles of mountainous terrain, an area that is even larger than the state of West Virginia. Today, the Tarahumara are a people whose rich spiritual ideology and strong cultural identity have persevered despite the intrusion of foreign customs. The Spanish originally encountered the Tarahumara throughout Chihuahua upon arrival in the 1500's, but as the Spanish encroached on their civilization the shy and private Tarahumara gradually retreated to less accessible canyons and valleys in the Sierra Tarahumara.\nThe Tepehuanes Indians - like their cousins, the Tarahumara - belong to the Uto-Aztecan Linguistic Group. While their strongest presence was in the state of Durango and some western points of Zacatecas, the Tepehuanes also lived and hunted in southern Chihuahua. The Tepehuanes are most famous for their defiant revolt against Spanish rule in 1616-1619. The historian, Dr. Charlotte M. Gradie, has discussed this revolt in great detail in her recently-published work, \"The Tepehuan Revolt of 1616:  Militarism, Evangelism, and Colonialism in Seventeenth-Century Nueva Vizcaya\" (The University of Utah Press, 2000).\nThe Varohío (or Guarijío) Indians are closely related to and speak a language very similar to the Tarahumara. They inhabited the Western Sierra Madre Mountains along the headwaters of  the Río Mayo of both Sonora and Chihuahua. The Guasapar Indians - also related to the Tarahumara - inhabited lands along the Chiniap and Urique Rivers in Chihuahua.\nThe Apaches - as latecomers to Chihuahua - probably first arrived in the area of Chihuahua in the Seventeenth Century. They were linguistically related to the Athapaskan speakers of Alaska and western Canada and worked their way south over a period of centuries. By the middle of the Eighteenth Century, Apache Depredations along the entire frontier region, including Chihuahua, had caused taken its toll Spaniard and Indian alike.\nThe history of Chihuahua's indigenous groups is a story of resistance against the intrusions of southern forces, Spaniards, French émigrés, and Indian laborers who settled in Chihuahua to work as laborers (and avoid the excessive taxation of central Mexico). In studying the story of Chihuahua as it progressed through the centuries, one finds mention of one war after another, each fought by various indigenous groups and for various reasons.\nThe Tepehuanes Revolt of 1616-1619 inflamed western and northwestern Durango and Southern Chihuahua. It is believed that the epidemics that struck the Tepehuanes population in 1594, 1601-02, 1606-07, and 1612-1615 became a catalyst for this rebellion. The famine and disease, writes Charlotte M. Gradie, the author of \"The Tepehuán Revolt of 1616: Militarism, Evangelism, and Colonialism in Seventeenth-Century Nueva Vizcaya,\" caused the Tepehuanes culture to undergo \"enormous stress from various factors associated with Spanish conquest and colonization.\" This stress convinced the Tepehuanes to embrace a return to their traditional way of life before the arrival of the Spaniards. However, after causing great damage to the frontier, the revolt was crushed by the Spanish military. After the failure of the Tepehuanes revolt, the Tarahumares of western and eastern Durango and southern Chihuahua also revolted in 1621 and   1622. This rebellion also met with defeat.\nAs early as 1567, the silver mines at Santa Barbara were established in the territory of the Conchos Indians. However, in 1631, a vast new silver strike was made at Parral in what is now southern Chihuahua. The strike in Parral led to a large influx of Spaniards and Indian laborers into this area of Tarahumara country north of Santa Barbara. However, the steadily increasing need for labor in the Parral mines, according to Professor Spicer, led to the \"forcible recruitment, or enslavement, of non-Christian Indians.\"\nAs Chihuahua became a center of the silver trade, the tremendous pressures on the indigenous inhabitants inflamed and provoke a flurry of revolts. From 1644 to 1652, the Tobosos, Salineros and Conchos revolted in northern Durango and southern Chihuahua. In \"Indian Assimilation in the Franciscan Area of Nueva Vizcaya,\" the anthropologist Professor William B. Griffen, commenting on the establishment of the silver mines at Parral in 1631, notes that the \"influx of new people and the resulting development of Spanish society no doubt placed increased pressure upon the native population in the region.\" Griffen also cites \"a five-year period of drought, accompanied by a plague,\" which had occurred immediately preceding the uprising as a contributing factor.  The large area of southern Chihuahua inhabited by the Conchos Indians included the highway between the mining districts of Parral, Cusihuiriachic, and Chihuahua.\nVery abruptly, in 1644, nearly all of the general area north and east of the Parral district of Chihuahua was aflame with Indian rebellion as the Tobosos, Cabezas, and Salineros rose in revolt.  In the spring of 1645, the Conchos - long-time allies of the Spaniards - also took up arms against the Europeans, allying themselves with the Julimes, Xiximoles, Tocones, and Cholomes. Although this revolt ended in defeat in 1645, a new revolt of the Tarahumara took place between 1648 and 1652. Then, between 1666 and 1680, the Salineros, Conchos, Tobosos and Tarahumares all rose in rebellion following a drought, famine and epidemic.\nIn the meantime, to the north, Franciscan missionaries had successfully pacified New Mexico, claiming some 34,000 Indian converts. By 1630, the colony at Santa Fe consisted of 250 Spaniards and 750 people of Indian and Spanish mixture. Starting around 1660, drought and crop failure started to plague New Mexico with increasing frequency. Starvation caused hundreds of Indians to die. Tension increased between the Indian population and the Spaniards led to a serious revolt in 1680.\nWhen the Great Northern Revolt took place in New Mexico in 1680, it did not affect just the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, as many believe. It was actually a widespread revolt that spread throughout all of Chihuahua and Durango. The Spaniards were pushed out of New Mexico down the Rio Grande to present-day El Paso. However, in 1684, as they nursed their wounds in El Paso, more rebellions popped up across much of Chihuahua. From Casas Grandes to El Paso, Conchos, Sumas, Chinarras, Mansos, Janos, and Apachean Jocomes all took up arms. The Tarahumaras also revolted once again in 1690 and were not defeated until 1698.\nDuring the Eighteenth Century a new threat would appear in Chihuahua. The Apache Indians, starting in 1751, became a constant and unrelenting enemy of the Spanish administration. As the Apaches attacked settlements throughout northern Chihuahua, the Spaniards were forced to establish a series of presidios to contain the threat. However, the steps taken to contain the Apache depredations had limited effect and, by 1737, Captain Juan Mateo Mange reported that   \"many mines have been destroyed, 15 large estancias along the frontier has been totally destroyed, having lost two hundred head of cattle, mules, and horses; several missions have been burned and two hundred Christians have lost their lives to the Apache enemy, who sustains himself only with the bow and arrow, killing and stealing livestock. All this has left us in ruins.\"\nBy 1760, Spain had established a total of twenty-three presidios in the frontier regions. But the Apaches, responding to these garrisons, developed adaptation in their mode of warfare. Apaches became such skilled horsemen that they effectively bypassed the presidios and continuously eluded the Spanish military forces. Professor Robert Salmon, the author of \"Indian Revolts in Northern New Spain: A Synthesis of Resistance (1680-1786)\" writes that, by the end of the Eighteenth Century, \"Indian warriors exacted high tolls in commerce, livestock, and lives.\"\nProfessor Griffen has explained that the Apache raids played a significant role in the assimilation of the Chihuahua indigenous groups, stating that the Apache raiders \"displaced or assimilated other groups of hunter-gatherers known as the Sumas, Mansos, Chinarras, Sumanos, Jocomes, and Janos.\"\nDuring the Eighteenth Century, the Comanche Indians had also begun to raid Spanish settlements throughout Texas and northern Chihuahua. T. R. Fehrenbach, the author of \"Comanches: The Destruction of a People,\" writes that \"a long terror descended over the entire frontier, because Spanish organization and institutions were totally unable to cope with war parties of long-striking, swiftly moving Comanches.\" Mounting extended campaigns into Spanish territory, the Comanches avoided forts and armies. T. R. Fehrenbach states that these Amerindians were \"eternally poised for war.\" They traveled across great distances and struck their victims with great speed. \"They rampaged across mountains and deserts,\" writes Mr. Fehrenbach, \"scattering to avoid detection - surrounding peaceful villages of peasants for dawn raids. They waylaid travelers, ravaged isolated ranches, destroyed whole villages along with their inhabitants.\"\nIn 1786, the Viceroy of Nueva España, Bernardo de Galvez, instituted a series of reforms for the pacification of the frontier. He constructed peace establishments (establecimientos de paz) for Apaches willing to settle down and become peaceful. Through this policy, several Apache bands were induced to forgo their raiding and warfare habits in exchange for farmlands, food, clothing, agricultural implements and hunting arms.\nAlthough the Spanish administration had negotiated with both the Apaches and Comanches in an effort to bring peace to the frontier era, the establishment of the Mexican Republic in 1822 led to a renewal of the Comanche and Apache wars. Between 1836 and 1852, the Chiricahua Apaches fought a running battle against both American and Mexican federal forces. The Apaches continued to defy both Mexico and the United States for many years until 1886, when Geronimo, the famous Chiricahua leader, surrendered in the Sierra Madres to American forces that had crossed the border for the special purpose of capturing Geronimo.\nAlthough many people living in Chihuahua during the Nineteenth Century were of Indian descent, most of the original indigenous groups had either been displaced, decimated, or assimilated. In the 1895 Mexican federal census, only 19,270 Chihuahua residents aged five or more claimed to speak an indigenous language. This figure increased to 22,025 in 1900 and 33,237 in 1910.  A large percentage of these indigenous speakers were Tarahumara and Tepehuanes Indians, who had managed to preserve their unique cultural and linguistic identities.\nIn the unusual 1921 Mexican census, residents of each state were asked to classify themselves in several categories, including \"indígena pura\" (pure indigenous), \"indígena mezclada con blanca\" (indigenous mixed with white) and \"blanca\" (white). Out of a total state population of 401,622, 51,228 persons (or 12.8%) claimed to be of pure indigenous background.  Another 201,182 - or 50.1% - classified themselves as being mixed, while 145,926 Chihuahua residents (36.3%) claimed to be white.\nIt is worth noting that the classifications for the entire Mexican Republic differed significantly from Chihuahua. Out of a total population of 14,334,780 in the Mexican Republic, 4,179,449 - or 29.2% - claimed to be of pure indigenous background, while 8,504,561 - or 59.3% - were of mixed origins. The total number of people who classified themselves as blanca was only 1,404,718 - or   9.8% of the population - a far cry from Chihuahua's figure of 36.3%.\nIn the Chihuahua of the present-day Mexico, the Tarahumara and Tepehuanes continue to represent the largest surviving groups of Amerindians. According to the 2000 census, the population of persons five years and more who spoke indigenous languages amounted to 84,086 individuals. The largest indigenous groups represented in Chihuahua were: Tarahumara (70,842), Tepehu�n (6,178), Náhuatl (1,011), Guarijio (917), Mazahua (740), Mixteco (603), Zapoteco (477), Pima (346), Chinanteco (301), and Otom� (220). Of these groups, only the Tarahumara, Tepehuán, Guarijio and Pima-speakers are indigenous to Chihuahua and adjacent states. The other groups are representative of migrants from southern Mexican states, such as Guerrero, Puebla and Oaxaca.\nThe mestizaje and assimilation of the indigenous Chihuahua people was widespread and today most of the state is truly Mexican in its makeup. Most of the people of Chihuahua today do not speak Indian languages or practice Indian customs. However, the assimilation of Chihuahua's people was a process that took place over several centuries and the land of Chihuahua - now at peace - was a dangerous battleground for many generations.\nCopyright � 2004 by John P.

This small breed has a short, pointed muzzle and dainty feet. They are known for their loyalty and devotion and despite their tiny stature, their suspicious nature makes them good watch dogs. Chihuahuas are very loyal and devoted to their owners.\nAd\nAverage Size: These tiny dogs range from 6-9 inches and 2-6 pounds.\nColor(s): All solid colors or mixture of colors.\nCoat Type: Short or long coats depending on the variety of dog. Short coats are glossy and soft to the touch. Long coats are also soft and can either be straight, wavy or curly.\nGrooming: Short coats that require minimal grooming. Long coats need more regular grooming to prevent matting. This breed requires standard care for eyes, ears, pads and nails.\nExercise Needs: This breed adapts well to apartment living. Although they are small in size, they enjoy plenty of exercise. Happy and content at home, Chihuahuas can be quite sensitive to the cold and should be protected if taken outdoors in inclement weather.\nTemperament: The playful Chihuahua is a highly intelligent and responds well to training. It is an excellent companion, although its loyalty and devotion can at times turn to jealousy. Chihuahuas do not enjoy being left alone by themselves and prefer to be with their masters or other family pets. This breed is naturally reserved around unfamiliar people and animals and will bark noisily at strangers.\nCommon Ailments: The Chihuahua is susceptible to patella luxation and eye problems.\nLife Expectancy: The expected life span of the Chihuahua is 15 or more years.\nTrivia: The name Chihuahua is derived from the Mexico State of the same name. Chihuahuas prefer the company of their own breed\n0 found this helpful\nJanuary  2, 2017 Flag\nThis is a guide about, \"Is my dog a full blooded Chihuahua?\".

Hersley [3 Posts, 1 Comment] 10 found this helpful\nFebruary  6, 2014 Flag\nHow and when did you get your pet?\nHe is the 4th born of a litter of 6, on November 22, 2013.\nWhat does your pet like to do for fun?\nHe loves to run through the house, chasing his parents and siblings. He has recently learned the magic of chew toys. He also enjoys it when the humans in the house have company visit, because everyone loves to look at him and play with him.\nDo you have anything else to share about your pet?\nOf six born in the litter, Mr. Little is the only brindle colored puppy. He is also the one with the calmest personality. He truly is an amazing little dog and is definitely one of a kind.\nI've had Chihuahuas all of my life. I've had friends with Chihuahuas. I've seen hundred, if not thousands of photos of Chihuahuas and I have never seen a brindled colored Chihuahua. That is also the most common comment that I hear about him. Everyone says that they have never seen one.\nChihuahua\nHow and when did you get your pet?\nLil Bit just showed up in our driveway the day after Thanksgiving in 2014. She was obviously abandoned because to this day I have not found anyone looking for her. I continue to check every day online, newspapers, etc. and will continue to check for anyone looking for her. I do this because I would like them to know that she is being well cared for and has a wonderful home. She was very, very, very skinny, infested with fleas twice the size of a grain of rice, thousands of them! She was very dehydrated and very scared. I bathed her, fed her, and she fell asleep on my chest zipped up inside my sweatshirt. She was the cutest little dog I had ever seen. Although up to that point I really wasn't a little dog person, she melted my heart immediately. She has since made her royal highness self very at home and she believes she rules this house! She has no fear of anything or anyone, not even a 160lb American Bulldog who walks by daily with his owner in tow. Much like her mom (me) she doesn't realize she's only 5lbs and has no problem letting anyone who walks by or rides by on a bicycle that she means business.\nShe is very much a mommy's and daddy's girl. My boyfriend is just as enamored of her as I am, although he won't admit it. She's very attached to me though, always choosing to cuddle up with me at night rather than her daddy and the other 2 dogs we have.\nWhat does your pet like to do for fun?\nLil Bit loves to terrorize our other female dog \"Lucy\", constantly biting on her ears, legs, and tail, whatever she can get ahold of, she nibbles on poor Lucy. Lil Bit loves to chase and be chased by Karma, my Seal Point Siamese, and can sometimes tolerate sleeping next to her, but don't even think about getting her to admit that! (Proof positive see the pics of Lil Bit above, sleeping next to Karma.)\nLil Bit also loves to go for rides with me when I pick my boyfriend up at work or any other trips she can convince me to take her on. She loves to play fetch (small tennis balls are the best fit) and if she gets upset about something, you know it because whatever is within her reach will become a pile of shredded bits and pieces. She will show you what happens when you don't let her go in the car for a ride. Shame on me for leaving her at home that day!\nDo you have anything else to share about your pet?\nLil Bit is the classic example of a Chihuahua, from what I have read and been told. She is rebellious, stubborn, and has yet to master potty training. She has a bad habit of \"marking\" her bed, our bed, the couch/chairs, etc., if we don't watch her closely. I am going to try bringing in a trainer soon, so I can be trained while she's being trained!\nI can't believe I am actually admitting this, but Lil Bit has the startings of a wardrobe like mine. She has many t-shirts, jackets, etc., but just recently I bought her a \"sundress\" (omg! really?). It has one shoulder strap and a cute little ruffle flower on the skirt. I put it on her and she pranced around like I knew she would, proud as all get out.\n\n"
