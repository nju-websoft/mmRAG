Mexico History - Culture, Religion and Lifestyle in Mexico Mexico City History | Culture | Religion | MexicoCity.com\nBlog\nMexico History\nThe land of Mexico City has been inhabitated for over 7000 years with the first tribes travelling from Central Europe around 5000 to 300 B.C. Some of the tribes in Mexico City settled around the slopes of mount Benacantil on which today stands the castle of Santa Barbara. The highlight of this mountain was that it wos close to the sea, but yet offered securoty from invaders due to its height. According to some historians, the Iberians (native Spanish) secured the hilltop by fortifying it.\nThe Nahua Aztec or Mexica tribe established Mexico City on 18th March 1325 and it became the capital of a sophisticated growing empire. It was originally located on a small island but because of its rapid growth, the city was forced to build artificial islands and a series of canals to absorb the growth of the metropolis. Rulers like Izcoatl, Moctezuma I, Axayacatl, Tizoc, Ahyuizotl, and Moctezuma II and their groups of eagle-warriors and jaguar-warriors led the city successfully with a pre-Colombian civilization.\nIn 1519, the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes entered the area. He acquired the city on 13th August 1521 and in 1524, it was rebuilt as the capital of the viceroyalty of New Spain. It was the political and cultural centre of Mexico and the administration of Guatemala, Yucatan, Cuba, Florida and Philippines was carried out from the city. The baroque Metropolitan Cathedral and the Basilica of Guadalupe were built during this period.\nThe area was under the Spanish rule and when Napoleon acquired Spain in 1808, the people of Mexico started to act for the self-rule under a Catholic priest named Father Miguel de Hidalgo Y Costilla. He led an armed revolution in 1810. This war of independence ended as Mexico became the host of the first ruler of the Mexican Empire, Agustin de Iturbide and the nation became a republic in March 1823. Then in 1824, the new government was established, the Mexican Federal District by the signing of their new constitution. The two-year war with the United States ended in 1848, after losing half of the country to the United States.\nBenito Juarez led the War of Reform which lasted from 1858 to 1861 and he captured the city in 1867. However, in 1871, Porfirio Diaz succeeded to overthrow the government and then the city was under the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz for three decades. During this period the French influence was forced out of Mexico City. The gold Angel of Independence was built under his administration to celebrate the first centenary of the beginning of the War of Independence. In February 1913, Mexico City suffered from the Decena Tragica, a battle between Francisco I. Madero's forces and Felix Diaz's, which destroyed many parts of the city.\nThe post-revolutionary government reinforced the importance of the city. In the late 20th century, Mexico City experienced most of its growth in population. In 1950, the city had a population of around 3 million.\nMexico City was the host for the Olympic Games in 1968 and FIFA World Cup in 1970. The city was hit by an earthquake of magnitude 8.1 on the Richter scale on 19th September 1985 at 07.19 am. It resulted in the deaths of around 5,000 people leaving around 90,000 people homeless. Mexico city again experienced an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 after 36 hours. However, it hosted the FIFA World Cup again in 1986 showing a rapid recovery.\nThe city continued its recovery and growth during the 1990s. Today, Mexico City has a remodeled World Trade Center Mexico, a skyscraper like Torre Mayor, the tallest building in Latin America. The city is ranked 8th among North America’s Top Ten Major Cities. It is one of the major economic and cultural centers with an international importance ranking 4th in Economic Potential and 4th as the Most Cost Effective city.\nRecommended Activities\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nEx-Mexican President De la ... 1985, devastated Mexico City residents ignored ... when he appeared at the World Cup soccer games Mexico hosted in 1986.

(AP Photo, File)\nMore\nMEXICO CITY (AP) — Former President Miguel de la Madrid, who led Mexico from 1982 to 1988 during an economic crisis and a devastating earthquake, died Sunday at age 77, the government said.\nDe la Madrid was the first in a string of presidents who pulled Mexico away from a state-dominated economy and toward free trade by bringing the country into the precursor to the World Trade Organization and by privatizing hundreds of government businesses.\nPresident Felipe Calderon called De la Madrid \"a Mexican with a profound commitment to the country\" in a statement confirming his death Sunday. The cause of death was not revealed, but the former president had been hospitalized in Mexico City with respiratory problems since Dec. 17.\nHis term was a grim time for most Mexicans, a six-year hangover after a spending binge by a previous government that was convinced soaring oil prices would never fall. When they did, the buying power of Mexican salaries was slashed in half as inflation chewed up paychecks.\nManuel Bartlett, who was interior secretary during De la Madrid's administration, told Mexican broadcaster Televisa that the former president served \"during one of the most difficult periods in the history of Mexico, a real collapse of the national economy.\"\nDe la Madrid, seen as a discrete and respectful man, pulled Mexico back from economic collapse during his presidency, but left it with a political crisis.\nMexican historian Enrique Krauze said De la Madrid's biggest failure was that he refused to accept the democratic transition Mexicans sought and got more than a decade later.\n\"He used to tell me 'you are too young, your ideas are not practical,'\" said Krauze, referring to discussions he had with the former president about suspected election frauds.\nThe government's handling of the election to replace De la Madrid caused a political scandal that later helped topple the political system that dominated Mexico for most of the 20th century.\nSome critics also see De la Madrid as the leader who was slow to react to Mexico's devastating magnitude-8 earthquake in 1985, which killed an estimated 9,000 people and flattened parts of the capital.\n\"There was this nationalist posturing of not accepting international aid when it was clear that Mexico needed it,\" Krauze said.\nThe initial economic panic in his administration was so deep that many thought De la Madrid did well just by not making things worse.\nAs he put it just before leaving office, \"I took a country with great problems and leave it with problems.\"\nDe la Madrid also launched a historic free-market transformation of Mexico's economy. He sold off about 750 of the 1,155 companies the government had owned when he took office and helped Mexico develop into a global industrial power, although one overwhelmingly dependent on the United States.\n\"The presidency of Miguel de la Madrid was very difficult,\" former President Carlos Salinas told reporters at his wake Sunday. \"What Mexico has changed for good in the past 25 years, started with De la Madrid.\"\nBorn on Dec. 12, 1934, to a prominent family in the western city of Colima, de la Madrid earned a degree from the National Autonomous University's law school, a spawning ground of Mexican politicians, and later earned a master's degree in public administration at Harvard University.\nHe began a rapid but unflashy climb through government agencies, serving in a series of finance-related posts before joining the Cabinet of President Jose Lopez Portillo as secretary of planning and programming in 1979.\nLike all presidents up to that time, Lopez Portillo was unchallenged master of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, and the country as a whole. He chose De la Madrid, a 47-year-old bureaucrat who had never held elective office, as his successor and forced party activists who favored a more savvy politician to accept it.\nIn the pro-forma vote that followed, De la Madrid won more than 75 percent of the vote. It was the last time that the result of a Mexican presidential election could be seen as inevitable.\nDe la Madrid's lack of political experience sometimes cost him dearly. When big earthquakes hit on Sept. 19 and 20, 1985, devastated Mexico City residents ignored government appeals to stay in their homes and instead formed impromptu rescue brigades that rushed to collapsed buildings to save lives, with little official help. De la Madrid's scarce public appearances fed the public outrage.\nThe grass-roots aid groups that emerged from the quake helped energize a political opposition that was already growing because of economic woes.\nJeers and catcalls from frustrated Mexicans showered down on the president when he appeared at the World Cup soccer games Mexico hosted in 1986.\nDe la Madrid fumbled again when that opposition roused the strongest challenge yet to the party that had held an ironclad grip on Mexico for six decades. The 1988 presidential election bid by leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was so strong the results were in doubt as the votes were being counted.\nThe government stopped reporting vote returns for a long period and then de la Madrid declared his own hand-picked successor Salinas the victor without formal results, leading many Mexicans to assume fraud had been committed. The ballots, never recounted, were burned three years afterward.\nAnger over that election helped accelerate reforms that allowed an opposition party to finally win the presidency in 2000.\nDe la Madrid himself claimed some small share of credit for overseeing Mexico's move to democracy. Some early reforms came under his leadership, and he shocked party faithful when he predicted a time, \"as Mexican society matures, when the opposition will share in the government.\"\nBut if Mexico's authoritarian system bent during his term, he did not break it. Opposition parties were allowed to win a few city mayoral races, but a ruling party victory for governorship of Baja California state was widely seen as fixed, and officials refused to accept clear opposition wins in some cities.\nDe la Madrid's main problems were rooted in the free-spending policies of Lopez Portillo, and a collapse in oil prices that left him with an economy that was spiraling rapidly downward, an inflation rate of more than 150 percent and an unpayable foreign debt of nearly $100 billion, more than half of the nation's gross domestic product at the time.\nHe raised taxes, cut the government budget, increased interest rates and imposed price and wage controls, while renegotiating debt conditions. Inflation dropped to about 50 percent.\nThe shrinking of the state also gave corrupt government officials fewer opportunities to squeeze private businessmen, and De la Madrid paired it with a \"moral renovation\" anti-corruption campaign that reached its high point, at least in terms of publicity, with the arrest of the state oil company chief. Still, even De la Madrid's closest aides acknowledged the overall cleanup effort largely failed.\nRelations with the U.S., always crucial for any Mexican leader, were mixed.\nDe la Madrid personally got along well with President Ronald Reagan, but the two governments disagreed sharply over Central America, particularly Nicaragua, where Mexico was viewed by administration officials as perhaps the most stalwart noncommunist backer of the leftist Sandinista government.\nMexico also sometimes irritated the U.S. with its shared leadership of the so-called Contadora Group of Latin American nations, which contributed to ending Central America's civil wars.\nRelations with Washington also were damaged when a U.S. drug agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar, was kidnapped, tortured and killed in Mexico in 1985.\nU.S. officials accused several high-ranking Mexican officials of collaborating with traffickers who killed Camarena, though a Mexican judge sentenced drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero to 40 years in prison for his role in the Camarena slaying.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press before leaving office, De la Madrid said that the challenge of living next to such a wealthy and complicated country had fed Mexico's sense of nationalism.\n\"Perhaps that is one of the great advantages of being a neighbor of the United States: our desire to continue being an independent and sovereign nation that rules its own destiny,\" he said.\nFor the most part, De la Madrid kept a low profile after leaving office, heading a state publishing company for several years.\nHe shook up Mexico's political class, however, when he gave a radio interview in 2009 accusing successor Salinas of stealing from a secret government fund and of turning a blind eye when his brother Raul Salinas profited from government contracts and contacts with drug traffickers.\nDe la Madrid retracted the allegations hours after they aired, claiming that because of his poor health he had been \"weak and confused\" in a radio interview with journalist Carmen Aristegui.\nOne of his five children, Enrique, has served in Mexico's congress and as director of the government farm finance bank, Financiera Rural. He also is survived by his wife, Paloma Cordero, and several grandchildren.\nReblog\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nHe was attacked for his poor handling of the Mexico City earthquake in 1985. ...

He was attacked for his poor handling of the Mexico City earthquake in 1985. Photograph: © Diego Goldberg/Sygma/Corbis\nMonday 2 April 2012 12.59 EDT\nFirst published on Monday 2 April 2012 12.59 EDT\nShare on Messenger\nClose\nFrom his shakeup of the national economy when he took power in 1982 to the crisis that accompanied his departure six years later, by way of a devastating earthquake in the middle of his term, Miguel de la Madrid's spell as president of Mexico was nothing if not eventful. But De la Madrid, who has died aged 77 after a long illness, gained a rather grey reputation in those difficult times, epitomised by his emotionless face as he was loudly booed at the opening of the World Cup in the Azteca Stadium in 1986. \"He is an intelligent and prepared man,\" Julio Scherer wrote in his book The Presidents, \"but depth and passion are missing.\"\nDe la Madrid was born into an old political family in the western city of Colima that had lost much of its influence in the Mexican revolution, then re-established itself as solid middle-class. His father, a well-known lawyer, was murdered in his office when Miguel was a child, prompting his mother to move the family to Mexico City. At the time the capital was convulsed by political turmoil as the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), established in 1929 as the National Revolutionary party, consolidated its hold on the presidency. The one-party regime lasted until 2000.\nDe la Madrid was a studious and unflashy young man who graduated as a lawyer then embarked on a quiet but quick rise through the ranks of the PRI bureaucracy. He took on a series of high- level finance-related positions before becoming the planning and budget secretary under president José López Portillo , his former teacher, who then chose the exemplary administrator as the party presidential candidate.\nUnder the PRI regime, presidents held near unlimited power for a single six-year term before handpicking their successor, who was then legitimised by elections where victory was never in doubt. De la Madrid took office with the economy on the brink of collapse, caused by the mismanagement and corruption of the López Portillo administration, which had transformed a story of incredible luck, with the discovery of one of the biggest oilfields ever found, into a legacy of unmanageable debt and rampant inflation.\nDe la Madrid promised a \"moral renovation\" that prioritised the recuperation of economic stability. This took on a grim form for most Mexicans as the new president slashed public spending, increased taxes and kept wages low. He also began to open up the country's closed, state-led economy to the private sector and the world. The combination helped begin to balance the books, but stripped the regime of the resources that had enabled it to keep a lid on popular discontent at the lack of democracy.\nDe la Madrid dramatically mishandled the aftermath of the 1985 earthquake that devastated Mexico City and killed thousands. While his government played down the tragedy, an energised civil society sprang into action. Rescue brigades were formed to fill the vacuum left by the state, inspiring a social movement that demanded political change.\nSoon after there was a split in the PRI, as a leftwing faction led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas broke from the party and mounted the first serious challenge to its political dominance in the 1988 elections. Many believe Cárdenas was cheated out of victory in the poll that was officially won by De la Madrid's chosen successor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari . De la Madrid appeared unmoved by the turmoil. \"I took a country with great problems and leave it with problems,\" he said.\nHe then followed the PRI-era tradition, in which former presidents faded from public life, until he caused a storm in a 2009 interview for saying he had \"made a mistake\" by picking Salinas to replace him. Salinas had become one of Mexico's most machiavellian, colourful and hated presidents. De la Madrid accused him of corruption, but a few days after the broadcast he retracted the charges, saying they were the product of \"a state of health that means I cannot adequately process dialogue or questions\".\nHe is survived by his wife, Paloma, and five children.\n• Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado, politician, born 12 December 1934; died 1 April 2012\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nWorld Cup 1986 in Mexico is the 13th World Cup: ...

Host voting was from this World Cup on only handled by the FIFA Executive Committee (Exco) instead of the FIFA congress. They announced on June 9 1974 in Stockholm that Colombia would host the 1986 World Cup.\nHowever in November 1982, 4 years before the World Cup would start, Colombia withdrew their bid! They stated the reason was financial problems the country was facing regarding the World Cup organisation. As a reaction, countries were able again to place a bid to host the 1986 World Cup.\nCanada, United States and Mexico showed interest and placed officially a bid. On May 20 1983 in Zurich, the Exco voted unanimously for Mexico, which was allowed to host the 1986 World Cup for the 2nd time. Their first World Cup was hosted in 1970. Mexico became the first country in World Cup history to have hosted a World Cup twice.\nThis was the first time the host country announcement was made from Zürich, Switzerland. From this announcement on, all the votes regarding the World Cup host countries would be announced in Zürich where the FIFA headquarters are based.\nOn September 19 1985 8 months before the World Cup, a severe earthquake occurred in Mexico City creating immense damage in several cities. This event created doubt whether Mexico would be able to continue with the preparations, as was the case with Chile, the host country of the 1962 World Cup. The stadiums however, were not damaged and Mexico was still able to go forward with the preparations and finished on time.\nThe year 1986 was declared as International Year of Peace by the United Nations. There was clearly emphasis on this declaration since the advertising boards on the stadiums showed both the FIFA and United Nations logos including the slogan: Football for Peace – Peace Year.\nThe logo of the 1986 World Cup received the following unofficial motto or slogan referring to the design of the logo: El Mundo Unido por Un Balón (The World United by a Ball). This slogan could be considered as the first ever World Cup slogan.\n11 host cities in Mexico\nWorld Cup 1986 Participants\nAs was the case with every new World Cup, more countries tried to qualify. For the 1986 World Cup a total of 121 countries participated in the qualifications, trying to be 1 of the 24 countries which eventually would participate in the tournament.\nAs was introduced in the 1982 World Cup, Mexico ‘86 would consist of 24 countries. 2 of them Mexico (host country) and Italy (previous World Cup winner) were automatically qualified.\n12 places for Europe were allocated to the following countries: Bulgaria, Belgium, Soviet Union, France, Hungary, Spain, Northern Ireland, Denmark, West Germany, England, Poland and Portugal. Denmark qualified for the first time and Portugal qualified for the first time since 1966.\n4 places for South America were allocated to the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay which qualified for the first time since 1958.\n2 places for Africa were allocated to the following countries: Algeria and Morocco.\n2 places for Asia were allocated to the following countries: South Korea and Iraq. Iraq qualified for the first time and South Korea qualified for the first time since 1954.\n1 place for North/Central America and Caribbean excluding Mexico was allocated to country Canada which qualified for the first time.\n1 intercontinental play-off had to be played by 2 countries which didn’t qualify directly: UEFA country Scotland against OFC country Australia. Scotland won the play-off and therefore qualified last minute for the 1986 World Cup. \n1986 World Cup match ball “Azteca” – First synthetic ball\nWorld Cup 1986 Groups\nAlthough Mexico ’86 contained 24 teams just like in Spain ‘82, the format introduced new features. The round-robin 2nd round which was introduced in the 1974 World Cup has been replaced with a different format. It is the Round of 16 that makes its introduction in this World Cup. This is the start of the knockout phase, meaning if you lose, you’re out.\nThe 6 groups are now mentioned as group A, B etc. instead of group 1, 2 etc. Each group contains 4 teams where the 2 best teams advance to the Round of 16. The 2nd interesting aspect of the format, is that for the first time in World Cup history the last 2 group matches would be played simultaneously. In both the 1978 and 1982 World Cups the last group matches were affected due to the result of the other group match previously played. (Remember Argentina against Peru in 1978? Or West Germany against Austria in 1982?). Therefore by introducing this rule, all 4 teams will give their best in the last group matches since it is uncertain yet what the outcome will be of the other match. The last group matches have become more exciting with this rule.\nThe 3rd new aspect of the 1986 format is that aside from the number 1 and 2 teams, the 4 best third place teams would advance to the Round of 16 as well. This means of the 6 groups, only 2 teams occupying the third place would not advance. If multiple third place teams have equal points, the goal difference rule would be implemented. If the goal difference was the same, the amount of goals scored would have to determine the position of both countries. Only when this amount is the same as well, lots had to be drawn. \nIn the Round of 16 the number 1 teams of the groups would play against the number 2 or number 3 teams of other groups. Although some Round of 16 matches contained number 2 teams against other number 2 teams, they would not play against number 3 teams.\nAfter the Round of 16, the winning team advanced to the Quarter-Finals. The last time the Quarter-Finals stage was played was back in Mexico ’70. After the Quarter-Finals the teams had to play the Semi-Finals before reaching the Final, or in the pessimistic case the match for the third place.\nThe 6 seed countries were Mexico, Italy, West Germany, Poland, France and Brazil. They were kept apart from each other and were placed in different groups.\nThe groups were as followed:\nGroup A\n1986 World Cup logo\nWorld Cup 1986 Stadiums\n12 stadiums were used in 11 host cities. In Mexico ’70, only 5 host cities and 5 stadiums were used. All the stadiums used in the 1970 World Cup were used in this tournament. In the 1986 World Cup 2 stadiums were used in Mexico City: Estadio Azteca and Estadio Olímpico. Estadio Azteca has the honour of being the first and only stadium so far to have hosted a World Cup Final twice.\nSoon Estadio Azteca will not be the only stadium anymore to have this privilege. Estádio do Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro will be the 2nd stadium to host a World Cup Final for the 2nd time during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\nThe following 11 cities and 12 stadiums were used in Mexico:\nEstadio Azteca\nWorld Cup 1986 Memorable Matches\nGroup Matches\nItaly – Argentina 1-1\nEstadio Cuauhtémoc, Puebla – attendance: 32,000\nArgentina was the only group A country which have won 2 matches. Therefore they easily advanced to the next round. The match against Italy was the only match Argentina didn’t win in this successful World Cup. Italian striker Alessandro Altobelli scored a penalty which resulted in a 1-0 score. Diego Maradona who was going to steal the show in Mexico ’86, scored the equalizer 28 minutes later. Both countries advanced including Bulgaria which didn’t win any matches.\nGroup B\nBelgium – Mexico 1-2\nEstadio Azteca, Mexico City – attendance: 110,000\nThis was the first win of the tournament for Mexico. Like Argentina, Mexico won 2 matches and drew 1 match. In the match against Belgium, Mexican players Fernando Quirarte and Hugo Sánchez scored the first 2 goals. Striker Erwin Vandenbergh scored for Belgium. Belgium ended up on the 3rd place but advanced to the next round. Although it appeared to be unlikely at first, Belgium would go far in this tournament with a great goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff. Mexico, for a 2nd time in history, advanced to the next round as well together with Paraguay.\nGroup C\nFrance – Soviet Union 1-1\nEstadio Nou Camp, León – attendance: 36,540\nA strong Soviet Union was able to defeat Hungary with an impressive 6-0 score. It was this high amount which would help Soviet Union to top group C. This was the only group C match which ended in a draw. Vasyl Rats scored first for Soviet Union and Luis Fernández for France. Both teams would win the other 2 group matches against Canada and Hungary. Therefore both teams ended up with 5 points. Since Soviet Union scored more goals than France thus ending up with a better goal difference, France ended up on the 2nd place. Hungary with 2 points became the only country in World Cup history to be eliminated as third place country due to the goal difference rule. Bulgaria and Uruguay of group A and E also had 2 points, but with a better goal difference.\nGroup D\nNorthern Ireland – Brazil 0-3\nEstadio Jalisco, Guadalajara – attendance: 51,000\nBrazil won their first 2 matches and would easily win this match against Northern Ireland. Careca scored the first and the 3rd goal of the match. Josimar who played his first World Cup scored the 2nd goal of the match. It was a goal which is his first and memorable at the same time. Josimar ended up playing since first choice right back Édson got injured. Northern Ireland was eliminated which meant goalkeeper Pat Jennings played his last international match. Jennings played international matches for 22 years and participated in 6 World Cup qualification rounds (1966-1986). Brazil topped the group and advanced together with Spain. The only group match Spain lost was the one against Brazil.\nGroup E (Group of Death)\nDenmark – Uruguay 6-1\nEstadio Neza 86, Nezahualcóyotl – Attendance: 26,500\nDenmark finally played their first World Cup and made an impressive debut! At least in the group stage. Group E was considered as the group of death with West Germany and Uruguay as strong opponents. Denmark however defeated all of them and trashed especially Uruguay. The only goal scored by Uruguay was a penalty taken by Enzo Francescoli. Søren Lerby, Michael Laudrup and Jesper Olsen scored a goal each for Denmark. Elkjær Larsen scored a hat-trick. Denmark obviously topped the group and advanced together with West Germany and Uruguay. Uruguay advanced without having won any group matches.\nGroup F\nPortugal – Morocco 1-3\nEstadio Tres de Marzo, Guadalajara – attendance: 28,000\nIn this match Morocco wrote history. This was the decisive match. Due to the 1-3 score, Morocco became the first African country to top a group and to advance to the next round. They also became the 2nd country outside Europe and America to advance. The first was North Korea back in the 1966 World Cup. Morocco drew the 2 previous group matches and therefore had to win against Portugal. Abderrazak Khairi scored 2 goals for Morocco and Krimau 1 goal. Midfielder Diamantino scored the only goal for Portugal. Portugal, which qualified for the first time since Eusébio wrote history in 1966, was eliminated. Portugal wasn’t having a great tournament and even refused to train between their first and the 2nd match.They went on strike due to prize-money issues. Although Portugal defeated England, it was Morocco, England and Poland which advanced. The goal difference rule needed to be used for England and Poland, resulting in England taking the 2nd spot and Poland the 3rd spot of the group.\nRound of 16\nMexico – Bulgaria 2-0\nEstadio Azteca, Mexico City – attendance: 114,580\nMexico the number 1 of Group B was to strong for Bulgaria. The first goal scored by Mexico was a beauty. Midfielder Manuel Negrete scored this classic goal with a spectacular scissors-kick. The goal boosted up Mexico’s confidence. In the 2nd half Raúl Servín scored the final goal. Bulgaria which finished 3rd in group A was eliminated without having won any matches in this tournament.\nSoviet Union – Belgium 3-4\nEstadio Nou Camp, León – attendance: 32,277\nThis exciting and unique match finished the 90 minutes with an end score of 2-2. Enzo Scifo and Jan Ceulemans  scored for Belgium and Igor Belanov scored 2 goals for Soviet Union. The match entered extra time. Belgium changed their pace resulting in Stéphane Demol and Nico Claesen scoring a goal in the first 15 minutes. Igor Belanov scored a penalty for Soviet Union 1 minute after the 4th Belgian goal. Desperately they were trying to find the net before extra time was over, but Soviet Union didn’t succeed. Although Igor Belanov scored a hat-trick, it was Belgium which advanced to the next round.\nArgentina – Uruguay 1-0\nEstadio Cuauhtémoc, Puebla – attendance: 26,000\nThe first ever World Cup Final back in 1930 was between Uruguay and Argentina. Since then, they have never encountered each other in a World Cup again. Until the 1986 World Cup! After 56 years Argentina had the chance to take revenge, and they did! Pedro Pasculli was the scorer of this important goal. Diego Maradona scored a goal as well but this was dissalowed. The 1-0 was enough to eliminate Uruguay and for Argentina to advance in the tournament.\nDenmark – Spain 1-5\nEstadio La Corregidora, Querétaro – attendance: 38,500\nDenmark was unstoppable in the group stage. But the race ended in the Round of 16 match. Their opponent was Spain. The match started good for Denmark. Jesper Olsen scored a penalty and changed the score into 1-0. Spanish player Emilio Butragueño equalized 2 minutes before half time. In the break Spain apparently changed their mindset completely. In the 2nd half they crushed Denmark with 4 more goals. Emilio Butragueño scored 3 more goals of which 1 was a penalty. Andoni Goikoetxea also scored a penalty. The Danish dream was suddenly over.\nQuarter-Finals\nBrazil – France 1-1 (3-4)\nEstadio Jalisco, Guadalajara – attendance: 65,000\nBrazil eliminated Poland and France eliminated Italy. Brazil was a hard opponent with having won every match so far in the tournament. It was Brazilian striker Careca who scored the first goal 17 minutes after kick-off. Michel Platini who also scored against Poland, scored his final World Cup goal in this match. Coincidentally this day was also his birthday. Before half time the score was 1-1. Nobody scored in the 2nd half but Zico had the chance to score the winning goal. A penalty was awarded but goalkeeper Joël Bats saved his penalty. Brazilian goalkeeper Carlos was lucky not to be booked in the match due to an obvious foul outside the box on French player Bruno Bellone. France as has happened in the Spain ’82, had to participate in a penalty shootout again. This was the first penalty shootout for Brazil. Alemão, Zico and Branco scored for Brazil. Sócrates and Júlio César missed. Yannick Stopyra, Manuel Amoros, Bruno Bellone and Luis Fernández scored for France. Bellone’s valid penalty was pretty remarkable since it had to hit the crossbar and the back of the goalkeeper first before entering the goal! Michel Platini was the only one who missed, the shot went over the bar. France advanced and Brazil was eliminated. This is the only World Cup penalty shootout so far which Brazil has lost.\nArgentina – England 2-1\nEstadio Azteca, Mexico City – attendance: 114,580\nA legendary and instant classic match this was. Many people can still remember this match clearly because of no one other than Diego Maradona. 2 legendary World Cup moments happened in this match. Amazingly both moments happened in a time span of 5 minutes! It was in this match against England where Maradona scored his famous ‘hand of God‘ goal. He clearly touched the ball with his hands but the referee didn’t see it. Maradona stated that the goal was scored “un poco con la cabeza de Maradona y otro poco con la mano de Dios” (“a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God”). 4 minutes later he scored a goal which in 2002 was selected as ‘Goal of the Century‘. Maradona dribbled half the length of the field past 5 English players before scoring his legendary goal. Striker Gary Lineker scored the only goal for England in the last 10 minutes of the match. With this goal Lineker became the 1986 World Cup top scorer with 6 goals. Nevertheless, Argentina won this match. Another memorable fact is that Argentina’s opponent was rival England. This match was politically charged due to the Falklands War which occurred 4 years earlier. This was Argentina’s revenge.\nSemi-Finals\nFrance – West Germany 0-2\nEstadio Jalisco, Guadalajara – attendance: 45,000\nWest Germany won the penalty shootout against Mexico and encountered France. In the 1982 World Cup they played against each other, where the shocking foul on Patrick Battiston occurrd by goalkeeper Harald Schumacher. They both shook hands before this match. Andreas Brehme scored early in the match resulting in 0-1 score. This remained for the majority of the 2nd half of the match. France was trying hard to score the 1-1, but  Rudi Völler’s goal ensured West Germany would enter the Final for a 2nd time in a row.  As in the 1982 World Cup, France lost to West Germany. For a 2nd time in a row, France had to play the match for the third place.\nArgentina – Belgium 2-0\nEstadio Azteca, Mexico City – attendance: 114,500\nFrom the 3rd position of group B, Belgium managed to go all the way to the Semi-Final. In the Quarter-Final Belgium defeated Spain in the penalty shootout. They became the first country which have scored all 5 penalties. They encountered Argentina in the Semi-Final, but Diego Maradona and his team were determined to win this World Cup. Diego Maradona scored a goal but was dissalowed since he used his arm. Nevertheless he scored 2 great goals where the last one is considered as 1 of the greatest World Cup goals ever as well. Argentina went to the Final and Belgium played the match for the third place, where they lost against France.\nWorld Cup 1986 Final\n2 giants Argentina and West Germany met each other in the Final. Argentina never managed to defeat West Germany in a World Cup. Argentina won the FIFA World Cup trophy only once (1978) and West Germany won already 2 times (1954, 1974) together with Uruguay.\nArgentina with captain Diego Maradona performed a memorable performance in this World Cup. Only 1 group match ended in a draw before beating all their opponents in the knockout stage. It was impossible not knowing who Diego Maradona was, especially after his ‘Hand of God’ goal and a legendary goal that since the year 2002 is called Goal of the Century. Both goals were scored against England in the Quarter-Final.\nThe 1986 Argentinian team\nAs in the previous World Cup, West Germany reached a World Cup Final again. Before reaching the knockout stage, they lost, won and drew a match. In the Quarter-Final against Mexico, a penalty shootout needed to be won in order to reach the Semi-Final.\nArgentina and West Germany encountered each other for the 3rd time in a World Cup. They played against each other in 1958 and in 1966 as well. West Germany ended up winning the 1958 match but the 1966 match ended in a draw.\nOn the 29th of June, in the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City with an attendance of 114,600 the Final was ready to start. the Final started with an opening goal by Argentinian player Jose Luis Brown (23′).That was the only goal scored in the first half. This changed completely in the 2nd half. 11 minutes after the 2nd half started, Argentinian Jorge Valdano scored the 2-0. But of course West Germany wouldn’t be West Germany if nothing surprising would happen.\nKarlheinz Förster and goalkeeper Harald Schumacher don’t make it easy for Maradona\nThey showed their opponent once more never to underestimate the Germans and scored 2 goals in the 74th and 80th minute. The first was scored by Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and the 2nd by Rudi Völler. With a score of 2-2 any team could still become 1986 World Cup champion. 3 minutes after Germany’s 2nd goal, Diego Maradona gave an excellent pass to Jorge Burruchaga who scored the final goal of the match: 3-2 (83’).\nJorge Burruchaga scores the 3-2 and final goal of the match\nArgentina won their 2nd World Cup and West Germany lost a World Cup Final for the 3rd time. 6 yellow cards were handed out in this Final which was a record, but this has already been beaten in the 2010 World Cup Final.\nMany people agree Maradona ‘single-handedly’ won this World Cup\nWest Germany would have their revenge in the next World Cup. For the first time a World Cup Final would repeat itself in a next World Cup.\nWest Germany = Green (Coach: Franz Beckenbauer)\nArgentina = White/Blue (Coach: Carlos Bilardo)\nWorld Cup 1986 Mascot\n1986 World Cup mascot Pique\nThe previous mascot of the 1970 World Cup in Mexico was Juanito, a little boy. This time a different mascot had to be created. As in Spain ’82, FIFA introduced a character that itself is related to the host country’s culture. This time it was a jalapeño pepper named Pique. The jalapeño pepper is a common ingredient in the Mexican hot cuisine to create spicy dishes. Pique’s name comes from picante which is Spanish for spicy peppers and sauces. Pique wears a moustache and the flat part of a sombrero since his head completes the sombrero form. Although Mexico is using green shirts, Pique contains a red shirt and white shorts to match Mexico’s colours. A green shirt would simply be hard to differentiate. As with other mascots, Pique is shown with a football. As with the latest mascots, the football is not the Azteca but the famous 1970 World Cup match ball Telstar.\nWorld Cup 1986 Song\nThe 1986 World Cup song is very different in comparison to the 1982 World Cup song. Instead of a catchy happy beat, a deep and beautiful English song named A Special Kind of Hero was introduced as the 1986 World Cup song. The singer who touched many with this beautiful piece of art is British musical theater actress Stephanie Lawrence. Unfortunately she passed away in 2000. A Special Kind of Hero is considered as one of the best and most memorable World Cup songs ever.\nWorld Cup 1986 Records\n3 countries qualified for the first time: Denmark, Iraq and Canada\nAlthough Denmark is FIFA member since 1904, they weren’t able to qualify for any of the previous 12 World Cups\nArgentina won the World Cup for the 2nd time\nFirst time the Round of 16 was played\nFirst time the last 2 group matches are played simultaneously\nMexico is the first country to have hosted a World Cup twice\nMorocco is the first African country to have reached the 2nd round\nEstadio Azteca is the only stadium so far to have hosted 2 World Cup Finals\nFirst time groups are not called by numbers (123456), but by letters (ABCDEF)\nAlgeria became the first African country to have qualified for a World Cup twice in a row\nUruguay player José Batista was given a red card 56 seconds after the kick-off in the first round match against Scotland, the quickest red card ever in a World Cup\nBelgium is the first country to have scored all 5 penalties in a penalty shootout\nParaguay’s coach’s Cayetano Ré is the first coach who was sent off after repeatedly walking on the pitch\nArgentina player Marcelo Trobbiani played the least amount of minutes on the field in World Cup history: only the last 2 minutes in the Final\nAlthough Soviet Union player Igor Belanov scored a hat-trick against Belgium, they lost the match (3-4).

Canedo, president of the Mexico 86 World Cup Organizing Committee, Dr. Hermann Neuberger, vice president of FIFA, and the man at right is unidentified. (AP Photo, File)\nMore\nMEXICO CITY (AP) — Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado, who led Mexico from 1982 to 1988 during economic crisis and a devasting earthquake, died Sunday at age 77, President Felipe Calderon announced on his Twitter account.\nA spokeswoman for Calderon's office speaking on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to be quoted by the press confirmed Sunday that the message was posted by Calderon.\nCalderon said he is \"profoundly sorry for the death of ex-President De la Madrid.\"\nThe cause of death was not immediately announced, but the former president had been hospitalized for respiratory problems since late last year.\nSeveral false rumors about De la Madrid's death surfaced in December, and Calderon even sent an incorrect tweet on his official Twitter account at that time offering condolences to the former president's family. He corrected that earlier false report minutes later.\nDuring his presidency, De la Madrid pulled Mexico back from economic collapse but left it with a political crisis.\nHis term from 1982 to 1988 was a grim time for most Mexicans, a six-year hangover after spending binge by the previous government that was convinced soaring oil prices would never fall. When they did, the buying power of Mexican salaries was slashed in half as inflation chewed up paychecks.\nA magnitude-8.1 earthquake killed an estimated 9,000 people and flattened parts of the capital. A fiery explosion at a government gas facility killed more than 500 people on the outskirts of Mexico City. The government's handling of the election to replace de la Madrid caused a political scandal that later helped topple the political system that dominated Mexico for most of the 20th century.\nBut the initial economic panic was so deep that many thought de la Madrid did well just by not making things worse.\nAs he put it just before leaving office, \"I took a country with great problems and leave it with problems.\"\nDe la Madrid also launched a historic free-market transformation of Mexico's economy. He sold off about 750 of the 1,155 companies the government had owned when he took office and signed international free-trade treaties that paved the way for the North American Free Trade Agreement and helped Mexico develop into a global industrial power, although one overwhelmingly dependent on the United States.\nBorn on Dec. 12, 1934, to a prominent family in the western city of Colima, de la Madrid earned a degree from the National Autonomous University's law school, a spawning ground of Mexican politicians, and later earned a master's degree in public administration at Harvard University.\nHe began a rapid but unflashy climb through government agencies, serving in a series of finance-related posts before joining the Cabinet of President Jose Lopez Portillo as secretary of planning and programming in 1979.\nLike all presidents to that time, Lopez Portillo was unchallenged master of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, and the country as a whole. He chose de la Madrid, a 47-year-old bureaucrat who had never held elective office, as his successor and forced party activists who favored a more savvy politician to accept it.\nIn the pro-forma vote that followed, de la Madrid won more than 75 percent of the vote. It was the last time that the result of a Mexican presidential election could be seen as inevitable.\nDe la Madrid's lack of political experience sometimes cost him dearly. When big earthquakes hit on Sept. 19 and 20, 1985, devastated Mexico City residents ignored government appeals to stay in their homes and instead formed impromptu rescue brigades that rushed to collapsed buildings to save lives, with little official help. De la Madrid's scarce public appearances fed the public outrage.\nThe grass-roots aid groups that emerged from the quake helped energize a political opposition that was already growing because of economic woes.\nJeers and catcalls from frustrated Mexicans showered down on the president when he appeared at the World Cup soccer games Mexico hosted in 1986.\nDe la Madrid fumbled again when that opposition roused the strongest challenge yet to the party that had held an ironclad grip on Mexico for six decades. The 1988 presidential election bid by leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was so strong the results were in doubt as the votes were being counted.\nThe government stopped reporting vote returns for a long period and then de la Madrid declared his own hand-picked successor Carlos Salinas the victor without formal results, leading many Mexicans to assume fraud had been committed. The ballots, never recounted, were burned three years afterward.\nAnger over that election helped accelerate reforms that allowed an opposition party to finally win the presidency in 2000.\nDe la Madrid himself claimed some small share of credit for overseeing Mexico's move to democracy. Some early reforms came under his leadership, and he shocked party faithful when he predicted a time, \"as Mexican society matures, when the opposition will share in the government.\"\nBut if Mexico's authoritarian system bent during his term, he did not break it. Opposition parties were allowed to win a few city mayoral races, but an ruling party victory for governorship of Baja California state was widely seen as fixed, and officials refused to accept clear opposition wins in some cities.\nDe la Madrid's main problems were rooted in the free-spending policies of Lopez Portillo, and a collapse in oil prices that left him with an economy that was spiraling rapidly downward, an inflation rate of more than 150 percent and an unpayable foreign debt of nearly $100 billion, more than half of the nation's gross domestic product at the time.\nHe raised taxes, cut the government budget, increased interest rates and imposed price and wage controls, while renegotiating debt conditions. Inflation dropped to about 50 percent.\nThe shrinking of the state also gave corrupt government officials fewer opportunities to squeeze private businessmen, and de la Madrid paired it with an a \"moral renovation\" anti-corruption campaign that reached its high point, at least in terms of publicity, with the arrest of the state oil company chief. Still, even de la Madrid's closest aides acknowledged the overall cleanup effort largely failed.\nRelations with the U.S., always crucial for any Mexican leader, were mixed.\nDe la Madrid personally got along well with President Ronald Reagan, but the two governments disagreed sharply over Central America, particularly Nicaragua, where Mexico was viewed by administration officials as perhaps the most stalwart noncommunist backer of the leftist Sandinista government.\nMexico also sometimes irritated the U.S. with its shared leadership of the so-called Contadora Group of Latin American nations, which contributed to ending Central America's civil wars.\nRelations with Washington also were damaged when a U.S. drug agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar, was kidnapped, tortured and killed in Mexico in 1985.\nU.S. officials accused several high-ranking Mexican officials of collaborating with traffickers who killed Camarena, though a Mexican judge sentenced drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero to 40 years in prison for his role in the Camarena slaying.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press before leaving office, de la Madrid said that the challenge of living next to such a wealthy and complicated country had fed Mexico's sense of nationalism.\n\"Perhaps that is one of the great advantages of being a neighbor of the United States: our desire to continue being an independent and sovereign nation that rules its own destiny,\" he said.\nFor the most part, de la Madrid kept a low profile after leaving office, heading a state publishing company for several years.\nHe shook up Mexico's political class, however, when he gave a radio interview in 2009 accusing Salinas of stealing from a secret government fund and of turning a blind eye when his brother Raul Salinas profited from government contracts and contacts with drug traffickers.\nDe la Madrid retracted the allegations hours after they aired, claiming that because of his poor health he had been \"weak and confused\" in a radio interview with journalist Carmen Aristegui.\nOne of his five children, Enrique, has served in Mexico's congress and as director of the government farm finance bank, Financiera Rural. He also is survived by his wife, Paloma Cordero, and several grandchildren.\nReblog\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nEl Tri: A pagan religion for ...

(Marco Ugarte/AP)\nThis is the third post in our  series  on politics, political science and the World Cup. Here are posts 1  and 2 . The next set of posts will look at soccer, culture and identity in specific countries, starting with Mexico.  Tamir Bar-On  is a professor in the Department of International Relations and Humanities at the Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Querétaro, Mexico. He is the author of “ The World Through Soccer: The Cultural Impact of a Global Sport .”\nThe great Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes once told an interviewer asking him about soccer, “If you want to talk about soccer, go talk to Juan Villoro .” According to Mexican intellectual Juan Villoro’s “ Dios es redondo ” (“God is round”), soccer is not merely a Mexican national passion, but rather a “secular religion.” In his new book “ Balón dividido ” (“Divided ball”), Villoro insists that soccer fans are superstitious and even religious, while soccer constitutes “a system of faith and beliefs.” Even if our team is losing 3-0, we still believe in “miracles,” argues Villoro.\nA faith underscores the psychological need for belonging. “Soccer has much less to do with sporting triumphs than with the desire to form an emotional community,” insisted Villoro in a New York Times interview in 2013. In “ Los once de la tribu ” (“The Tribe of Eleven”), Villoro compared the national soccer team to a “tribe” and the players on the pitch represent “us,” “defend” what “defines us” and what is “ours,” and carry in their boots both “our hopes” and “our scars.”\nLegendary Mexican international soccer heroes, from Hugo Sánchez to contemporary stars such as Javier Hernández and Giovani dos Santos , are Mexico’s “gods” and they play (or played) for us in pagan “temples,” sometimes on Sundays. Mexican national soccer teams often qualify for World Cup competitions, but have never fulfilled the country’s expectations. As a result, Mexico looked to individual “gods” to carry the banner of the nation abroad. Antonio Carbajal , a Mexican goalkeeper who played in five World Cups from 1950 to 1966, is a national legend because he is the only goalkeeper to play in five World Cups.\nMexican artist Manuel Mancilla agrees with Villoro’s assessment of soccer as a Mexican pagan religion. Mancilla’s paintings include “Juego de los dioses” (Game of the gods) and “Dioses del estadio” (Gods of the stadium). For Mancilla, soccer is a secular religion and its practitioners and fans experience the divine. One of his most beautiful paintings is called “La chilena de Chac-mool,” an ancient pre-Columbian figure performing the difficult “bicycle kick” maneuver. Chilena connotes bicycle kick, while Chac-mool refers to a form of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican sculpture showing a reclining figure with its head facing ninety degrees from the front, supporting itself on its elbows and holding a bowl or a disk upon its stomach. The figures first appeared in the Valley of Mexico among the Aztecs and the northern Yucatán Peninsula in the ninth century.\n“Chac Mool” is also the title of a short story written by Carlos Fuentes. When Mexico defeated Panama in a key World Cup qualifier at the fabled Estadio Azteca in 2013, the game-winning goal was scored courtesy of a spectacular Raúl Jiménez chilena. On the night of the goal, Manuel Mancilla sent Raúl Jiménez the image of his “La chilena de Chac-mool” through Facebook and the star forward responded with a “like.”\nA secular religion needs its temples and flock of believers. Soccer stadiums are “sacred sites” or “temples,” as Desmond Morris pointed out in his 1981 classic “ The Soccer Tribe .” The soccer “temples” fulfill key human functions such as the need for belonging and the power of the group, argued Morris. Indeed, famous Mexican side Club Deportivo Guadalajara, more popularly known as “Chivas,” is nicknamed Rebaño Sagrado (Sacred Flock). Devoted Mexican believers of the national team need to visit Santa Úrsula (Saint Ursula), a large suburb in Mexico City. It is the site of Estadio Azteca and home to the Mexican national soccer team and Club América. It is the world’s third largest stadium. Azteca hosted two World Cups, in 1970 and 1986. Those two World Cup finals included the two greatest soccer “gods” the game has ever seen: Pelé and Maradona. In a soccer correspondence with the Argentinean writer Martín Caparrós, Juan Villoro asserted that a soccer match “without people is like a baptism without a child.” At the 1986 World Cup, Mexico played all of its first round matches at the Estadio Azteca: A 2-1 victory against Belgium in front of 110,000 fans; a 1-1 draw versus Paraguay witnessed by 114,000; and a 1-0 win against Iraq seen by 103,000. According to the University of California-Riverside English Professor and feminist cultural critic Jennifer Doyle , faith in the women’s game was evident when more than 100,000 fans attended the final of the unofficial women’s World Cup in 1971 at the Estadio Azteca. Denmark defeated Mexico 3-0. Contrary to FIFA’s claims, it is the largest crowd to ever attend a women’s soccer game.\nSuccessive Mexican presidents have used soccer to distract the population from deep-seated corruption, decades of one-party Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) rule until 2000, extreme poverty, or the violence of the “war on drugs.” In 1988, Carlos Salinas de Gortari won Mexico’s presidential election through massive voting fraud. In the same year, the Mexican Football Federation was found guilty of fielding overage players in a CONCACAF U-20 tournament. FIFA banned Mexico from all international competitions for two years, thus excluding the national team from the 1990 World Cup.\nSoccer is Mexico’s pagan religion for all social classes, both the powerful and the powerless, Yet, the politicization of soccer by Mexican politicians has not always succeeded. President Miguel de la Madrid inaugurated the 1986 World Cup, but as Duncan Tucker explains, “the audio engineers in the Estadio Azteca had to turn up his microphone in an attempt to drown out eight minutes of booing from the crowd.” Mexicans were extremely angry as a result of de la Madrid’s tepid response to the major earthquake that devastated Mexico City in 1985.\nMexico’s best World Cup results included reaching the quarterfinals in the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, both of which were held on Mexican soil. The hosting of the World Cup reflects the geopolitical imbalance of world politics, as few countries can host World Cup events. Mexico used the World Cups in 1970 and 1986 to win international favor and achieve an aura of advanced modernization in the eyes of domestic and international audiences. Writing in a 1992 issue of Studies in Latin American Popular Culture, the sports historian Joseph Arbena argued that soccer has been utilized by political elites in order to build the nation from within and gain respect and legitimacy from without.\nLa Ilusión Nacional (The National Illusion) is the title of a 2014 film by Mexican director Olallo Rubio . It does not dispute Arbena’s aforementioned thesis, but highlights the gap between the religious-like hopes surrounding the national soccer team and its less than satisfactory performances at World Cup tournaments. Mexico has qualified for every World Cup tournament since 1994, but never reached beyond the second round since the 1986 World Cup. Rubio traces the history of fanatical support for the “national religion” from El Tri’s (named after Mexico’s tricolor flag composed of green, white and red) first appearance in an international tournament at the 1928 Olympic Games to the spectacular victory over Brazil in the final of the London 2012 Olympics.\nMexican intellectuals and some coaches realize that the pagan religion cannot always be neatly exploited for political purposes. As Fausto Pretelin Muñoz de Cote , a Mexican professor at the prestigious Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México notes, “soccer cannot create miracles.” When Mexico won the gold medal at the 2012 Olympic Games, the Mexican coach Luis Fernando Tena was deliberately sanguine in a post-match television interview: The victory “gave Mexicans joy,” but it could not change the realities of the thousands of dead in a “war on drugs,” or the biting poverty of many of his compatriots. Mexico is the 14th biggest economy in the world and second largest in Latin America. Yet, in 2013 Mexico’s government estimated that 33 per cent of its population lives in conditions of moderate poverty and another 9 per cent experiences extreme poverty.\nMexico barely qualified for the 2014 World Cup. It required two emphatic victories against New Zealand in order to seal its passage to Brazil. Thus, the current national mood is that Mexico will not go past the first round of the World Cup, or it will be defeated in the second round against superior opponents such as Spain or Holland.\nYet the national mood is also one of a rising power in Latin America and perhaps the world. Mexico is a G-20 member, but also has a growing economy and a population of 120 million. Alejandro Magos , a blogger for Global Brief , argues that Mexico will surprise at the World Cup because “the opportunities to beat its regional rivals on its own turf is too good to be missed.” Mexico and Brazil will clash on and off the field this year and beyond, as the two states “assert their strategic, social, and economic primacy among Latin American states,” writes Magos. Mexico and Brazil will meet in the first round of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\nMexico’s 2012 Olympic Gold medal victory, as well as the World Cup triumphs of the U-17 national team in 2005 and 2011, might spur Mexico’s players to supersede the pessimism of the national illusion and perhaps make history in Brazil. Mexico can count on the passion of its fans, which see the game as a secular religion and believe in miracles. Miracles on the pitch could, in turn, promote Mexico’s national renewal. Yet, whether they win, draw, or lose, El Tri is central to the national faith. As one popular saying states in relation to the long-suffering fans of Guadalajara-based Atlas, “I support Atlas, no matter if they lose.” This saying could have easily been in reference to El Tri’s devoted fans. The story of the Mexican national soccer team is the tale of a ceaseless devotion to a pagan faith.\npolitics\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\nWorld Cup Tales: Colombia 1986 – The World Cup That ... the hosts of the 1986 World Cup finals should have been Colombia.

World Cup Tales: Colombia 1986 - Twohundredpercent World Cup Tales: Colombia 1986 - The World Cup That Never Was | Twohundredpercent\nPosted by Ian | May 12, 2010 | Latest | 8 |\nThe upcoming World Cup will the first to take place in the entire continent of Africa but there are several countries that have already held the tournament more that once, such as Italy, France and Germany. The first team to earn the honour of hosting the World Cup finals twice, however, was Mexico and the story of how this came to pass is as much a story of the politics of FIFA as it is of the qualities of Mexico when it comes to hosting the finals of the tournament. The truth of the matter is that the hosts of the 1986 World Cup finals should have been Colombia.\nThen, as now, the decision made over who to award the World Cup was made many years before the actual tournament took place. In the case of the 1986 tournament, the decision was taking during a tumultuous year for FIFA – 1974, the year that Joao Havelange replaced Stanley Rous as the president of FIFA. Havelange campaigned on the principle of an expanded role within the game for the Asian and African confederations and Rous, who had in 1963 campaigned for Apartheid South Africa to be allowed to play in the World Cup, was an easy picking for him. Havelange would go on to reward those that had supported him by expanding the tournament, it was too late for him to do anything about Colombia – for now.\nThe Colombian bid had been the brain-child of the country’s president, Misael Pastrana Borrero. Pastrana had come to power as the result of a later discredited election during the summer of 1970 as a political conservative, and his grand schemes for his country were not untypical for the era. He envisaged huge construction projects as being the key to Colombia’s prosperity, and the World Cup certainly sat as part of that. With Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Mexico having already hosted the tournament and Argentina pencilled in for 1978, why shouldn’t it be Colombia in 1986? This would be his legacy to the country.\nExcept it wasn’t that simple. The M-19 guerilla group were just one of many inspired by Pastrana’s fraudulent election win of 1970 and Pastrana would be the last Conservative leader in Colombia. In the years after his departure, the country would slide further and further into debt, and the rise to power of drug cartels would provide a backdrop of kidnap and murder in the country that started to raise serious questions over whether the World Cup could be held safely in Colombia. In addition to this, the grandiose building plans of Pastrana had long since fallen by the wayside. The promised new stadia hadn’t been built and, it seemed increasingly likely, couldn’t be built. At the start of 1983 Colombia conceded that it wouldn’t be able to host the tournament and returned the rights to it.\nThis created what could have been regarded as a crisis for FIFA, but one man’s crisis is another man’s opportunity and for Joao Havelange, this was an opportunity. Initially, four nations – the United States of America, Brazil, Canada and Mexico – put themselves forward to host the tournament, but Brazil soon dropped out, leaving only the Americans, Canadians and Mexicans to battle it out. In an extraordinary “vote”, which wasn’t so much a vote as an instruction from FIFA’s executive committee on which way to vote, every single vote went to Mexico. But why should this be? It is possible to argue that Canada, a country that hadn’t in 1983 ever qualified for a World Cup finals presented a weak bid, but the USA? If any federation was likely to present a strong case, it would surely be the Americans.\nFormer President Richard Nixon’s Secretary of State Henry  Kissinger had been the chair of the North American Soccer League’s Board of  Governors since 1977, and the case that he put forward was a strong one. The NASL was past its peak by 1983, but hosting a World Cup would bring the world’s game to its most lucrative audience. Pele and Franz Beckenbauer spoke out in favour of the bid. The American sporting infrastructure could hand FIFA a massive tournament. Congress, however, refused to give governmental support for the American bid and almost quickly as it had been conceived, it was over when the tournament was handed to Mexico.\nEven congressional support, however, would have been unlikely to be enough to win the bid for Kissinger. With the benefit of hindsight, there were two primary reasons why the 1986 World Cup was awarded to Mexico. Firstly, FIFA’s relationship with the United States Soccer Federation was at best described as fractious. In 1981, FIFA had threatened to outlaw the NASL and suspend the USSF (who had supported their league) over fundamental changes to the laws of the games that the NASL had introduced, such as a thirty-five yard offside line and using shoot-outs to decide drawn matches. The NASL never fully implemented the changes to the game that FIFA had demanded, but when the 1986 World Cup became suddenly became available again, FIFA found that revenge is a dish often best served cold.\nThe second reason was to do with the commercial affairs of FIFA. Guillermo Cañedo had been the president of Club America in Mexico City and was also the head of Televisa, the Mexican media conglomerate, which owned the club, as well as two other Mexican clubs, Necaxa and Atlante. He was also a FIFA vice-president, and he promised a World Cup that would provide a template for the way that the tournament is still run today. Official partners were brought in and ticket prices increased. Crowds for some group matches shrank as locals were priced out. It made some people very wealthy, and the appeal to FIFA was obvious. In addition to this, playing the tournament in Mexico appeased potential anger from the South American confederation, CONMEBOL. It played to a gallery that Havelange could use to cement his worldview upon the game.\nSo it was that Mexico held its second World Cup finals in sixteen years, and the hideous earthquake that struck Mexico City in September 1985 gave a moral angle to the tournament that it hadn’t previously held. Miraculously, the stadia all semmed to survive and Mexico 86 went ahead, with lunchtime kick-offs under a blazing sun for the benefit of European television audiences, from which Televisa profited massively. Two months after the Mexico City earthquake, a volcano caused a landslide that hit the Colombian region of Armero, killing 20,000 people – twice as many people as had been killed in the Mexico City earthquake. Six weeks later, the Supreme Palace of Justice in Bogota was seized by the M-19 guerilla group – eleven of the country’s Supreme Court Justices were amongst over one hundred people killed in the subsequent army raid.\nIt seems likely that Colombia will bid for the 2026 World Cup finals, by which time forty years will have passed since the tournament that never was. There is, however, a serious danger that the Colombians will be overlooked, because 2030 marks the centenary of the World Cup and it is expected that Argentina and Uruguay, who contested the 1930 final, will launch a joint bid for the 2030 finals. More significantly, it is widely understood that CONMEBOL is highly supportive of this bid and, whilst the CONCACAF rent-a-gob Jack Warner has already urged the Colombians to bid for 2026, it seems inconceivable that FIFA will allow two successive tournaments on the same continent or that CONMEBOL will not support an alternate bid with such an emotional pull. Considering, however, that the internal workings of FIFA remain a mystery to most that don’t pass regularly pass through the corridors of its Zurich headquarters, it would seem unwise to bet against Colombia getting another chance eventually.\nShare:\n\n\nDOCUMENT 8:\n\n... former Mexican President Miguel de la ... 1985, devastated Mexico City ... appeared at the World Cup soccer games Mexico hosted in 1986.

De la Madrid, who led Mexico from 1982 to 1988, died Sunday April 1, 2012 at age 77, Mexico's President Felipe Calderon announced on his Twitter account.  (AP)\nMEXICO CITY –  Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado, who led Mexico from 1982 to 1988 during economic crisis and a devasting earthquake, died Sunday at age 77, President Felipe Calderon announced on his Twitter account.\nA spokeswoman for Calderon's office speaking on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to be quoted by the press confirmed Sunday that the message was posted by Calderon.\nCalderon said he is \"profoundly sorry for the death of ex-President De la Madrid.\"\nThe cause of death was not immediately announced, but the former president had been hospitalized for respiratory problems since late last year.\nSeveral false rumors about De la Madrid's death surfaced in December, and Calderon even sent an incorrect tweet on his official Twitter account at that time offering condolences to the former president's family. He corrected that earlier false report minutes later.\nDuring his presidency, De la Madrid pulled Mexico back from economic collapse but left it with a political crisis.\nHis term from 1982 to 1988 was a grim time for most Mexicans, a six-year hangover after spending binge by the previous government that was convinced soaring oil prices would never fall. When they did, the buying power of Mexican salaries was slashed in half as inflation chewed up paychecks.\nA magnitude-8.1 earthquake killed an estimated 9,000 people and flattened parts of the capital. A fiery explosion at a government gas facility killed more than 500 people on the outskirts of Mexico City. The government's handling of the election to replace de la Madrid caused a political scandal that later helped topple the political system that dominated Mexico for most of the 20th century.\nBut the initial economic panic was so deep that many thought de la Madrid did well just by not making things worse.\nAs he put it just before leaving office, \"I took a country with great problems and leave it with problems.\"\nDe la Madrid also launched a historic free-market transformation of Mexico's economy. He sold off about 750 of the 1,155 companies the government had owned when he took office and signed international free-trade treaties that paved the way for the North American Free Trade Agreement and helped Mexico develop into a global industrial power, although one overwhelmingly dependent on the United States .\nBorn on Dec. 12, 1934, to a prominent family in the western city of Colima, de la Madrid earned a degree from the National Autonomous University's law school, a spawning ground of Mexican politicians, and later earned a master's degree in public administration at Harvard University.\nHe began a rapid but unflashy climb through government agencies, serving in a series of finance-related posts before joining the Cabinet of President Jose Lopez Portillo as secretary of planning and programming in 1979.\nLike all presidents to that time, Lopez Portillo was unchallenged master of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, and the country as a whole. He chose de la Madrid, a 47-year-old bureaucrat who had never held elective office, as his successor and forced party activists who favored a more savvy politician to accept it.\nIn the pro-forma vote that followed, de la Madrid won more than 75 percent of the vote. It was the last time that the result of a Mexican presidential election could be seen as inevitable.\nDe la Madrid's lack of political experience sometimes cost him dearly. When big earthquakes hit on Sept. 19 and 20, 1985, devastated Mexico City residents ignored government appeals to stay in their homes and instead formed impromptu rescue brigades that rushed to collapsed buildings to save lives, with little official help. De la Madrid's scarce public appearances fed the public outrage.\nThe grass-roots aid groups that emerged from the quake helped energize a political opposition that was already growing because of economic woes.\nJeers and catcalls from frustrated Mexicans showered down on the president when he appeared at the World Cup soccer games Mexico hosted in 1986.\nDe la Madrid fumbled again when that opposition roused the strongest challenge yet to the party that had held an ironclad grip on Mexico for six decades. The 1988 presidential election bid by leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was so strong the results were in doubt as the votes were being counted.\nThe government stopped reporting vote returns for a long period and then de la Madrid declared his own hand-picked successor Carlos Salinas the victor without formal results, leading many Mexicans to assume fraud had been committed. The ballots, never recounted, were burned three years afterward.\nAnger over that election helped accelerate reforms that allowed an opposition party to finally win the presidency in 2000.\nDe la Madrid himself claimed some small share of credit for overseeing Mexico's move to democracy. Some early reforms came under his leadership, and he shocked party faithful when he predicted a time, \"as Mexican society matures, when the opposition will share in the government.\"\nBut if Mexico's authoritarian system bent during his term, he did not break it. Opposition parties were allowed to win a few city mayoral races, but an ruling party victory for governorship of Baja California state was widely seen as fixed, and officials refused to accept clear opposition wins in some cities.\nDe la Madrid's main problems were rooted in the free-spending policies of Lopez Portillo, and a collapse in oil prices that left him with an economy that was spiraling rapidly downward, an inflation rate of more than 150 percent and an unpayable foreign debt of nearly $100 billion, more than half of the nation's gross domestic product at the time.\nHe raised taxes, cut the government budget, increased interest rates and imposed price and wage controls, while renegotiating debt conditions. Inflation dropped to about 50 percent.\nThe shrinking of the state also gave corrupt government officials fewer opportunities to squeeze private businessmen, and de la Madrid paired it with an a \"moral renovation\" anti-corruption campaign that reached its high point, at least in terms of publicity, with the arrest of the state oil company chief. Still, even de la Madrid's closest aides acknowledged the overall cleanup effort largely failed.\nRelations with the U.S., always crucial for any Mexican leader, were mixed.\nDe la Madrid personally got along well with President Ronald Reagan , but the two governments disagreed sharply over Central America, particularly Nicaragua , where Mexico was viewed by administration officials as perhaps the most stalwart noncommunist backer of the leftist Sandinista government.\nMexico also sometimes irritated the U.S. with its shared leadership of the so-called Contadora Group of Latin American nations, which contributed to ending Central America's civil wars.\nRelations with Washington also were damaged when a U.S. drug agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar, was kidnapped, tortured and killed in Mexico in 1985.\nU.S. officials accused several high-ranking Mexican officials of collaborating with traffickers who killed Camarena, though a Mexican judge sentenced drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero to 40 years in prison for his role in the Camarena slaying.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press before leaving office, de la Madrid said that the challenge of living next to such a wealthy and complicated country had fed Mexico's sense of nationalism.\n\"Perhaps that is one of the great advantages of being a neighbor of the United States: our desire to continue being an independent and sovereign nation that rules its own destiny,\" he said.\nFor the most part, de la Madrid kept a low profile after leaving office, heading a state publishing company for several years.\nHe shook up Mexico's political class, however, when he gave a radio interview in 2009 accusing Salinas of stealing from a secret government fund and of turning a blind eye when his brother Raul Salinas profited from government contracts and contacts with drug traffickers.\nDe la Madrid retracted the allegations hours after they aired, claiming that because of his poor health he had been \"weak and confused\" in a radio interview with journalist Carmen Aristegui.\nOne of his five children, Enrique, has served in Mexico's congress and as director of the government farm finance bank, Financiera Rural. He also is survived by his wife, Paloma Cordero, and several grandchildren.\nAdvertisement\n\n"
