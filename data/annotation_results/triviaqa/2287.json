Record Breakers - Beautiful Britain Record Breakers\nRecord Breakers\nIt is with great trepidation that I list these various ' record breakers ' as someone is bound to claim that somewhere in Britain there is something that is smaller, shorter, higher, deeper etc. than my choice of record breakers!

Picture 2 - The village of              Flash in Staffordshire (4 miles from Buxton in Derbyshire) claims to be Britain's highest village, at a height of 1518 feet above sea level. Picture 3 - Thanks to Brian Montgomery from Scotland's Museum of Lead Mining who wrote to say \"I work in a village in Scotland that is registered at 1531 feet above sea level ! The village is called Wanlockhead and is in Dumfries & Galloway.\" Brian's picture above (click it for a better view) shows the road sign exhibiting 1531 feet. So ..... which is higher? The Macclesfield Express, 15th August 2007 , should settle the matter once and for all, but, maybe not!\nThe world's narrowest hotel\nfreshwater lake\nBritain's smallest city\nPicture 1 - The Star Hotel in Moffat (Dumfries and Galloway) is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's narrowest hotel and is only 20 feet wide.

Loch is simply the Scottish Gaelic and Irish word for a lake ... This article is a guide to the five largest ... The Five Largest Freshwater Lochs in Scotland - Holiday Parks The Five Largest Freshwater Lochs in Scotland - Holiday Parks\nThe Five Largest Freshwater Lochs in Scotland\nThe Five Largest Freshwater Lochs in Scotland\nJanuary 22, 2013 at 2:44 pm\nThe Five Largest Freshwater Lochs in Scotland: Lochs by Volume, Area, Length and Depth\nLoch Ness might get almost all the press when it comes to the Scottish Lochs, but it’s by no means the largest or longest. There are at least 31,460 lochs in Scotland, and out of these, there are lochs that are deeper, longer and larger in area than Loch Ness. Loch is simply the Scottish Gaelic and Irish word for a lake or sea inlet, and there is only one natural body of water called a ‘lake’ in Scotland: Lake Menteith. This article is a guide to the five largest lochs by volume, area, length and depth.\nHoliday Parks offer breaks at Lomond Woods at Loch Lomond – the largest loch in Scotland by surface area.\n \n5 Largest Scottish Lochs by Volume\nLoch Ness is by far the largest loch in Scotland by volume, and it contains more water than all of the lakes in England and Wales combined. Of course, it’s apparently the home of the fabled Loch Ness monster, and this huge volume of water has given Nessy plenty of space to hide over since her modern ‘sighting’ in 1933.\n5 Largest Scottish Lochs by Area\nLoch Ness wins for volume for its consistent depth for its area, but Loch Lomond actually has a considerably larger surface area. Most originated from glacial over deepening of the valleys they now occupy, and are subsequently long and thin in shape. Loch Lomond has a bulbous southern expanse of water, which gives it a greater surface area than the other lochs.\n5 Longest Scottish Lochs\nLoch Awe is the longest loch – just beating Loch Ness by 2km. It is located to the West of Loch Lomond in Argylle and Bute. While it has a length of 41km, it has an average width of 1km. It is particularly well renowned for trout and salmon – so if you’re a keen fisher, then Loch Awe is a good spot.\n5 Deepest Scottish Lochs by Depth\nLoch Morar is the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles, at a depth of 310m. Much like Loch Ness, it’s home to a legendary monster – dubbed morag by the locals. Loch Morar would be able to fit the newly opened London building The Shard, which is also 310m in height, exactly in its depth.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nThe \"Oldest, Highest, Longest, Smallest\" page. ... The largest Lake in England is Lake Windermere in the English Lake District and the largest lake in Great Britain ... BeenThere-DoneThat: Oldest, Highest, Longest, Smallest. BeenThere-DoneThat: Oldest, Highest, Longest, Smallest.\nThe \"Oldest, Highest, Longest, Smallest\" page.\nOLDEST:\nCHURCHES:\nThe oldest church in Britain is probably St. Peter's-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex which dates from the 7th Century.\nThe oldest log church in the world is St. Andrew's Church at Greensted, near Ongar, Essex although that only really applies now to the walls of the nave, which date from the 11th Century.\nThe oldest cathedral in Britain is Durham Cathedral, started in 1093, which is also the oldest Norman building.\nThe oldest church door in England (Saxon - 1060) is still on St. Botolph's church in the village of Hadstock in Essex.\nThe oldest working turret (or tower) clock in England is in the tower of St. Mary's Church in Rye, Sussex.\nINNS:\nThe oldest inn in Britain is, officially, Ye Olde Fighting Cocks in St. Albans, Hertfordshire - it's listed in the Guiness Book of Records.\nBRIDGES:\nThe oldest bridge in Britain is thought to be Tarr Steps on Exmoor, Somerset which is a Clapper Bridge.\nSTRUCTURES:\nThe oldest surviving Roman structure in Britain is the Balkerne Gate together with the Roman wall at Colchester , Essex.\nThe oldest timber-framed barn in the world is Barley Barn in Cressing Temple barns, Braintree, Essex.\nLONGEST\nThe longest footpath in England is the South West Coast Path at 630 miles.\nThe longest footpath in Wales is the Pembrokeshire Coast Path at 186 miles.\nThe longest footpath in Scotland is the Southern Upland Way at 211 miles.\nHIGHEST\nMOUNTAINS & HILLS:\nThe highest mountain in Britain and Scotland is Ben Nevis (4368 feet) near Fort William, Scotland.

The highest, and probably the most remote, station on the normal railway network is on Rannoch Moor (1350 feet) in Scotland.\nDEEPEST\nLAKES:\nThe deepest lake in Britain is Loch Morar in the Highlands of Scotland at 1017 feet deep.\nThe deepest lake in England is Wast Water in the Lake District at 250 feet deep.\nCAVES:\nThe deepest cave in Britain is Ogof Ffynnon Ddu in Wales at 1,010 feet deep.\nSHORTEST\nRIVERS:\nThe shortest river in Britain is the River Morar which runs from the deepest freshwater loch/lake in Europe (Loch Morar) to the sea and is just short of 1000 yards long.\nSMALLEST\nINNS:\nThe smallest Inn in Britain is The Nutshell, Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk at 15ft x 7ft 6in. I understand that they don't provide food as there's no room to eat it.\nCHURCHES:\nThe smallest church in Britain is Bremilham Church, on a farm at Foxley-cum-Bremilham near Malmesbury, Wiltshire, and measures just 11 feet by 10 feet. The smallest church still holding regular services is Culbone Church near Porlock Weir, Somerset.\nCITIES:\nThe smallest City in Britain is St. David's , Pembrokeshire, Wales.
