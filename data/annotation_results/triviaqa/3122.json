On the road; Buying & owning; ... the engine can struggle to move the weight of the car, so the Shogun feels very sluggish when overtaking. 2016 Mitsubishi Shogun review | What Car? 2017 Mitsubishi Shogun review | What Car?\nThe Mitsubishi Shogun looks good, it's well specified and it’s a proper off-roader. Unfortunately, the on-road drive is less impressive, and the Shogun’s best rivals are far more civilised.\nThe Mitsubishi Shogun is great off-road and feels robustly built. It seats up to seven and is well equipped, but it may be the Tonka Toy looks that really appeal\nThe Mitsubishi lacks refinement and although the diesel engine has plenty of pulling power, it can still struggle with the weight of the car\nDriving\nWhat it’s like to drive, and how quiet it is\nMitsubishi Shogun performance\nThe Shogun is impressive off-road and benefits from the 3.2-litre diesel's huge amount of pulling power. The gearboxes have low ratios for added grip and the option of a rear differential lock for super-muddy conditions. On-road, however, the engine can struggle to move the weight of the car, so the Shogun feels very sluggish when overtaking.\nOpen Gallery\nMitsubishi Shogun ride & handling\nYou could happily spend hours conquering the roughest off-road terrain in the Shogun, but the picture isn’t so rosy when the surface you’re tackling is more conventional. This huge car feels cumbersome when negotiating bends, not helped by a huge amount of body lean. The ride feels very agricultural on the road, too, with plenty of fidgeting and knocking.\nMitsubishi Shogun refinement\nThe Shogun's diesel is very gruff. It’s not too bad at low off-road speeds. But it’s more tiresome on the asphalt. Higher speeds also generate lots of wind noise around the large door mirrors and upright windscreen. Tyre noise is also too evident.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nCompany car tax; MOT tool; News; ... Car News; Mitsubishi Shogun: prices cut by ...

The starting price for the range is now £26,199.\nThe Mitsubishi Shogun is available as either a three-door short wheelbase car that seats five, or a long wheelbase, seven-seat five-door model.\nAll Shogun models have a 3.2-litre diesel engine that produces 197bhp and 325lb ft of torque. There are four trim levels across the range – SG2 and Warrior for the short wheelbase model, or SG2, SG3 and SG4 if you choose the long wheelbase version.\nThe entry-level manual SG2 model is now £26,199 in short wheelbase form or £28,599 for the seven-seat car – specifying the automatic gearbox costs an extra £1685.\nStandard equipment across the range includes six airbags, climate control, electric windows, heated front seats, 18-inch alloy wheels and a six-speaker MP3-compatible CD player.\nSG3 specification – only available in long wheelbase guise with the automatic 'box – costs from £33,799. The extra £3515 over SG2 spec adds an electric sunroof, premium 12-speaker sound system, rear parking sensors with reversing camera, 7-inch touchscreen sat-nav, full leather upholstery and Bluetooth connectivity.\nThe range-topping SG4 model is now £36,799. This includes 20-inch alloy wheels as well as a DVD player and screens in the rear headrests. At this price, it is cheaper than an entry-level Land Rover Discovery 4.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\n... the Mitsubishi Shogun isn’t as comfortable or modern ...

Mitsubishi Shogun SUV review | Carbuyer Mitsubishi Shogun SUV review | Carbuyer\nImage 1 of 15\nThe downside to that capable diesel engine (the only one available) is that just like the Shogun, it’s far from modern. Fuel economy is unimpressive, with the five-door version returning just 30.4mpg and the three-door only bettering this figure by 1mpg; high CO2 emissions mean both cost a whopping £500 in annual road tax , too. Compare this to the Volkswagen Touareg (itself a relatively expensive car to run), which returns 42.8mpg and costs £210 a year to tax, and it’s clear that Mitsubishi is some way off the pace with the Shogun’s running costs.\nWhile the Shogun is almost unbeatable off-road, during normal driving it’s pretty uncomfortable and feels somewhat agricultural when compared to the Touareg and Discovery. On winding B-roads, the Mitsubishi develops noticeable body lean, while bumps in the road cause it to jiggle about unpleasantly. In fairness, many SUVs are underwhelming on winding backroads, but the Shogun isn’t much better on the motorway, where its loud engine, uncomfortable seats and noticeable wind noise make it a far from relaxing car to drive. Still, the Shogun has plenty of loyal fans, partly thanks to its honest nature and go-anywhere ability.\nInside, this capable but unrefined theme continues. The Shogun’s dashboard feels well put-together and is logically laid out, but the plastics used are a little low-rent and the overall design is uninspiring. It’s roughly on par with the Toyota Land Cruiser for overall fit and finish, but Land Rover Discovery drivers may feel like they’ve taken a step back in time when climbing into a Shogun. Interior space is generous (although adults will find the two third-row seats of the five-door model tight) and the high ride height means the driver and passengers get a great view out.\nImage 2 of 15\nThe three-door Shogun has a relatively small 290-litre boot, while the five-door model has a more impressive 663 litres of storage space – although with all seven seats up, this shrinks to 221 litres. Do note that the boot door opens sideways, which can be a pain in tight parking spaces and garages.\nThe Shogun is available in different trim levels depending on whether you choose the three or five-door model. The three-door starts off with entry-level SG2 trim, with higher trim levels known as Warrior and Barbarian. The five-door model also starts with SG2, but then moves up through SG3 and SG4 trims on to the top-spec SG5 model. All cars come with alloy wheels, air-conditioning, cruise control, LED running lights, bright xenon headlights, automatic wipers, Bluetooth phone connectivity and remote central locking, with leather trim standard on all but the entry-level SG2.\nIn terms of reliability, while the Shogun didn’t feature in our 2016 Driver Power customer satisfaction survey, it uses tried-and-tested mechanical parts and should live up to its robust nature. Safety is more of a grey area: while all Shoguns come with mandatory equipment like electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes and ISOFIX child-seat mounts, more advanced systems like autonomous emergency braking aren’t available. The Shogun also wasn’t put through Euro NCAP’s crash-testing programme , so no official safety ratings are available.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nMitsubishi cars: research Mitsubishi ... with the launch of the compact Mitsubishi 500, that the company began producing passenger ... was a key vehicle produced by ...

The parent company has its roots in producing commercial vehicles for its home market of Japan.\nA Japanese word meaning \"three diamonds,\" Mitsubishi was founded in by Yataro Iwasaki, a descendant of samurais, in the early 1870s. The company's initial focus was on shipping, but it quickly diversified into areas such as mining and ship repair. In 1917, Mitsubishi unveiled the Model A, Japan's first series production passenger car.\nIt wasn't until 1960, with the launch of the compact Mitsubishi 500, that the company began producing passenger vehicles on a large scale. That decade also saw the launch of other Mitsubishi light passenger vehicles like the 360 Van and 360 Pickup. The company also distinguished itself on the racetrack during this decade, taking top honors in Japan's Grand Prix.\nMitsubishi's automobile production arm was officially spun off into a company of its own with the establishment of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation in 1970. The company's Colt made its way to American shores in 1971, the same year in which Chrysler purchased a 15 percent stake in the new company. However, the Colt wasn't sold under the Mitsubishi name, but rather under the Dodge brand, reflecting Chrysler's interest in the company. By the end of the decade, Mitsubishi was producing more than 1 million cars per year.\nIn 1982, Mitsubishi began selling cars in the U.S. under its own name. Through the '80s it offered a variety of cars for the states, including the subcompact Mirage, turbocharged Starion sports car and midsize Galant sedan. Mitsubishi hit its stride in the '90s, thanks to the popularity of the Eclipse sport coupe and 3000GT sports car in the U.S. and the turbocharged Lancer Evolution in other parts of the world.\nChrysler made the most of its partnership, as it used Mitsubishi platforms under many of its models. The Eclipse, in particular, was a key vehicle produced by the Diamond Star Motors partnership. In 1998, Chrysler merged with Daimler-Benz to become DaimlerChrysler. Mitsubishi's partnership continued with DaimlerChrysler for a few years but was financially terminated by 2003.\nThe new millennium has been a struggle for Mitsubishi. Its vehicles have grown stale with consumers and sales have wavered. At one point the company was forced to admit that it had systematically covered up vehicle defects in Japan. On the upside, though, the company's compact, high-performance sedan, the Lancer Evolution, has been a continuing success in the United States. Going forward, Mitsubishi plans to revitalize its brand by developing environmentally friendly vehicles (such as its all-electric \"i\" hatchback) that are still fun to drive.\nHide Mitsubishi History\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nMitsubishi Shogun review. ... Two passenger car versions are available, ... TOP MANUFACTURERS. Audi; Jaguar; Hyundai; Honda; Mercedes-Benz; Renault; Mitsubishi Shogun Review | Autocar Mitsubishi Shogun Review (2017) | Autocar\nMitsubishi Shogun review\nThe Shogun has been on sale in its current form since 2006\nHigh spec models have a genuine high-end look\nShort and long wheelbase models are offered\nThe trappings of high-end SUVs are available\nLong wheelbase models have seven seats, short wheelbase models have five\nThe interior is fairly utilitarian rather than luxurious\nCommercial vehicle variants are available\nClose\nThe Mitsubishi Shogun used to enjoy a massive market share thanks to the number of buyers seeking a robust, rugged but comfortable SUV without the Range Rover price tag.\nSince then, environmental pressures - both financial and social - have polarised the SUV market. Upmarket models sell in good numbers as an alternative to luxury cars, but the volume arena has shrunk, succeeding mainly where buyers need them for more practical reasons.\nRoad test editor\nThe Shogun used to have a huge market share. It is now a niche product\nIt's no surprise that the Shogun sells best in rural areas. As it's never had the 'Chelsea Tractor' tag, its less sensitive to changes in fashion, hence why the Shogun last received its significant revamp in 2006, before the latest changes in 2012.\nThe major mechanicals were introduced at the turn of the millennium. Two passenger car versions are available, alongside a commercial vehicle version. The models of interest to Autocar are the five seat short and seven seat long wheelbase configurations.\nBoth models have the air of ruggedness in their design, with the spare wheel mounted on the tailgate and plastic mouldings around the bottom of the car. Its off-road credentials back up the look. It has four driving modes - rear wheel drive, full time four-wheel drive, four-wheel with a locking centre diff and low-range gearing for more extreme off-road use.\nChanges for the 2012 model year include some styling tweaks, but most importantly, a Euro V-compliant engine. Fundamentally though, the Shogun and its engine are dated.\nThe Shogun's 197bhp, 325lb ft, 3.2-litre four-cylinder engine is noisy and lumpy compared to the latest six and eight-cylinder units, but emissions have been cut to between 207 and 224g/km. Performance is reasonable, with the models reaching 62mph in between 9.7 and 11.1sec.\nIt doesn't go down the road too well. The primary ride is okay, especially for tall car; it resists excess roll and float but coupled to that, is an unsettled secondary ride across smaller lumps and imperfections. On the plus side, it has good off-road credentials and can tow 3500kg.\nThe cabin is feels built to last, but it lacks the tactility of the more upmarket models in its class. Equipment levels are reasonable, with all models receiving cruise and climate control and heated seats, and most versions adding leather seats and cruise control.\nThe Shogun might have an enviable reputation in reliability surveys, but high-end models are pricey - a £40,000 sticker price isn't hard to achieve - putting it in the firing line of some seriously desirable metal. And while the Shogun has undeniable talents, the price tag of high-end models doesn't correlate.\n\n"
