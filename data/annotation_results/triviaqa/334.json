He began playing chess at age 6, by age 13 was the Soviet youth champion, and won his first international tournament at age 16 in 1979. Kasparov became an international grandmaster in 1980. From 1973 to 1978 he studied under former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik .\nKasparov first challenged the reigning world champion Anatoly Karpov in a 1984–85 match, after he survived the Fédération Internationale des Échecs ( FIDE ; the international chess federation) series of elimination matches. Kasparov lost four out of the first nine games but then adopted a careful defensive stance, taking an extraordinarily long series of drawn games with the champion. With Kasparov finally having won three games from the exhausted Karpov, FIDE halted the series after 48 games, a decision protested by Kasparov. In the two players’ rematch in 1985, Kasparov narrowly defeated Karpov in a 24-game series and thereby became the youngest official champion in the history of the game.\nIn 1993 Kasparov and the English grandmaster Nigel Short left FIDE and formed a rival organization, the Professional Chess Association (PCA). In response, FIDE stripped the title of world champion from Kasparov, who defeated Short that same year to become the PCA world champion. In 1995 he successfully defended his PCA title against Viswanathan Anand of India .\nIn 1996 Kasparov defeated a powerful IBM custom-built chess computer known as Deep Blue in a match that attracted worldwide attention. Kasparov and the team of Deep Blue programmers agreed to have a rematch in 1997. Deep Blue’s intelligence was upgraded, and the machine prevailed. Kasparov resigned in the last game of the six-game match after 19 moves, granting the win to Deep Blue. In 2000 Kasparov lost a 16-game championship match to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia .\nGarry Kasparov playing against Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer built by IBM.\nAdam Nadel/AP\nKasparov retired from competitive chess in 2005, though not from involvement in chess. In particular, he produced an acclaimed series of books, Kasparov on My Great Predecessors (2003–06), that covered all the world chess champions from Wilhelm Steinitz through Karpov, as well as many other great players. He also kept in the public eye with his decision in 2005 to start a political organization, the United Civil Front, to oppose Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin . In 2006 Kasparov was one of the prime movers behind a broad coalition of political parties that formed the Other Russia, a group held together by only one goal: ousting Putin from power. In 2007, following several protest marches organized by the coalition in which Kasparov and other participants were arrested, the Other Russia chose Kasparov as its candidate for the 2008 presidential election but was unable to nominate him by the deadline.\nLearn More in these related articles:\nin chess (game)\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nOriginal name Garry Weinstein or Harry Weinstein, Russian chess master who became the world chess champion ...

The chess games of Garry Kasparov The chess games of Garry Kasparov\n[ what is this? ]\nOne of the greatest players of all time, Kasparov was undisputed World Champion from 1985 until 1993, and Classical World Champion from 1993 until 2000. Known to chess fans world wide as the <Beast From Baku> on account of his aggressive and highly successful style of play, his main early influence was the combative and combinative style of play displayed by Alexander Alekhine .\nEarly Years\nOriginally named Garry Kimovich Weinstein (or Weinshtein), he was born in Baku, in what was then the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (now the Republic of Azerbaijan), and is the son of Klara Shagenovna Kasparova and Kim Moiseyevich Weinstein. At five years old, young Garry Weinstein taught himself how to play chess from watching his relatives solve chess puzzles in a newspaper. His immense natural talent was soon realized and from age 7, he attended the Young Pioneer Palace in Baku (where for some time he was known as \"Garry Bronstein\".*). At 10, he began training at the Mikhail Botvinnik Soviet chess school. He was first coached by Vladimir Andreevich Makogonov and later by Alexander Shakarov . Five years after his father's untimely death from leukemia, the twelve year old chess prodigy adopted the Russian-sounding name Garry Kasparov (Kas-PARE-off) a reference to his mother's Armenian maiden name, Gasparyan (or Kasparian).\nChampionships\nJunior Twelve-year old Kasparov won the Soviet Junior Championship, held in Tbilisi in 1976 scoring 7/9, and repeated his success in 1977, winning with a score of 8� of 9. The next several years were spent marking his rise as a world-class talent. He became World Junior Champion in 1980 in Dortmund, the same year he earned the grandmaster title.\nNational He first qualified for the Soviet Chess Championship at age 15 in 1978, the youngest ever player at that level. He won the 64-player Swiss system tournament at Daugavpils on tiebreak over Igor Vasilievich Ivanov , to capture the sole qualifying place. He was joint Soviet Champion in 1980-81 with Lev Psakhis **  and in 1988 Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov tied in the Super-Soviet Championship***. In 2004, Garry Kasparov won the Russian Championships (2004) with a stunning +5 score.\nWorld On the basis of his result in the 1981 Soviet Championship, which doubled as a zonal tournament for the USSR region, he earned a place in the 1982 Moscow Interzonal tournament, which he won, to qualify for the Candidates Tournament matches that were held in 1983 and 1984. At age 19, he was the youngest Candidate since Robert James Fischer , who was 15 when he qualified in 1958. At this stage, he was already the #2-rated player in the world, trailing only world champion Karpov on the January 1983 list. These Candidates matches were the first and last Candidates matches Kasparov contested, as he declined to participate in the Candidates held under the auspices of the PCA in 2002 to decide a challenger to his successor as classical World Champion, Vladimir Kramnik . Kasparov's first Candidates match in Moscow was a best-of-ten affair against Alexander Beliavsky , whom he defeated 6�3 (+4 -1 =4). After much political ado, Kasparov defeated Viktor Korchnoi in London in the best-of-12 semi-final match by  7�4 (+4 -1 =6), and in early 1984 in Vilnius he defeated former World Champion Vasily Smyslov in the best-of-16 finals played by 8.5-4.5 (+4 =9 -0) to earn his challenge against Karpov. By the time the match with Smyslov was played, Kasparov had become the number-one ranked player in the world with a FIDE rating of 2710. He became the youngest ever world number-one, a record that lasted 12 years until being broken by Vladimir Kramnik in January 1996 and again by his former pupil, Magnus Carlsen in 2010.\nAt one stage during the Karpov - Kasparov World Championship Match (1984) , Kasparov trailed 5-0 in the first-to-win-6 match. He then fought back to win three games and bring the score to 5�3 in Karpov's favour after 48 games, making it the longest world championship match ever. At that point, the match was ended without result by the then FIDE President, the late Florencio Campomanes , with Karpov thus retaining the title. Further details can be found in the match link at the head of this paragraph. Kasparov won the best-of-24 games Karpov - Kasparov World Championship Match (1985) in Moscow by 13�11, winning the 24th and last game with Black. He was then 22, the youngest ever World Champion, and broke the record held by Mikhail Tal for over 20 years. Karpov exercised his right to a rematch, the Karpov - Kasparov World Championship Rematch (1986) , which took place in 1986, hosted jointly in London and Leningrad, with each city hosting 12 games. Kasparov won 12��11�, retaining the title. The fourth match, the Kasparov - Karpov World Championship Match (1987) was held in Seville. Karpov had been directly seeded into and won the final match of the Candidates' Matches to again become the official challenger. Kasparov retained his title by winning the final game and drawing the match 12�12. The fifth and last championship match between the two, Kasparov - Karpov World Championship Match (1990) , was held in New York and Lyon in 1990, with each city hosting 12 games. Kasparov won by 12��11�. In their five world championship matches, the combined game tally was +21 -19 =104 in Kasparov�s favour.\nKasparov subsequently defended his title against Nigel Short under the auspices of the PCA in 1993, and against Viswanathan Anand in 1995. Five years later, in 2000 ( Kasparov - Kramnik World Championship Match (2000) ), Kasparov finally relinquished his crown to his former student, Vladimir Kramnik, who was granted the right to challenge without having to qualify, the first time this had happened since 1935, when Alexander Alekhine selected Max Euwe as his challenger. Subsequently, Kasparov remained the top rated player in the world, ahead of both Kramnik and the FIDE World Champions, on the strength of a series of wins in major tournaments.\nUnder the \"Prague Agreement� which was put together by Yasser Seirawan to reunite the two titles,  Kasparov was to play a match against the 2002 FIDE World Champion Ruslan Ponomariov in September 2003. But this match was cancelled when Ponomariov was dissatisfied with the terms of the contract. Subsequent plans for a match against 2004 FIDE World Champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov , to be held in January 2005 in the United Arab Emirates, fell through due to lack of funding. Shortly after this, Kasparov announced his retirement from competitive chess.\nIn an interview in 2007, Kasparov said that <�my decision in 1993 to break away from the world chess federation, FIDE, with Nigel Short was the worst mistake of my career. It was a serious miscalculation on my part. I thought we could start fresh with a professional organisation, but there was little support among the players. It led to short-term progress in commercial sponsorship for chess, but in the long run hurt the game...> ****\nClassical Tournaments\nIn 1978, Kasparov won the Sokolsky Memorial tournament in Minsk as a wild card entry, a victory which convinced Kasparov he could aim for the World Championship. He played in a grandmaster tournament in Banja Luka, Yugoslavia in 1979 while still unrated, due to Korchnoi�s withdrawal. He took first place with an undefeated record, two points ahead of the field. Game Collection: Banja Luka 1979 He emerged with a provisional rating of 2595, immediately landing at world number 15, a feat only surpassed by Gata Kamsky in July 1990. His first win in a superclass-level international tournament was scored at Bugojno, Yugoslavia in 1982, and his win in Linares in 2002 was the tenth victory in a row, a record for the most consecutive victories in super tournaments: Linares 4 (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, Wijk aan Zee 3 (1999, 2000, 2001), Sarajevo 2 (1999, 2000) and Astana 1 (2001). Kasparov also holds the record for most consecutive professional tournament victories, placing first or equal first in 15 individual tournaments from 1981 to 1990. It started with the 1981 USSR Championship and finished in Linares in 1990. His five epic title matches against Karpov were held during this period. Subsequently, Kasparov won Linares again in 1992, 1993, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2005, the latter being his swan song from the game.\nOlympiads\nKasparov played in eight Olympiads. He represented the Soviet Union four times, in 1980, 1982, 1986 and 1988, and Russia four times: in 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2002 playing board 1 on each occasion apart from 1980 (2nd reserve) and 1982 (2nd board). In 82 games, he scored (+50 =29 -3), for 78.7% and won a total of 19 medals, including 8 team gold medals, 5 board golds, 2 performance golds, 2 performance silvers and 2 board bronzes. Kasparov also represented the USSR once in Youth Olympiad competition at Graz in 1981, when he played board 1 for the USSR board 1, scoring 9/10 (+8 =2 -0), the team winning the gold medal.\nTeam chess\nKasparov made his international teams debut for the USSR at age 16 in the 1980 European Team Championship at Skara and played for Russia in the 1992 edition of that championship. He won a total of five medals including at Skara 1980, as USSR 2nd reserve, 5�/6 (+5 =1 -0), team gold, board gold and at Debrecen 1992, Russia board 1, 6/8 (+4 =4 -0), team gold, board gold, performance silver.\nMatches\n<Computer> Kasparov defeated the chess computer Deep Thought (Computer) in both games of a two-game match in 1989. In February 1996, he defeated IBM's chess computer Deep Blue (Computer) with three wins and two draws and one loss. In 1997, an updated version of Deep Blue defeated Kasparov 3��2� in a highly publicised six-game match. The match was even after five games but Kasparov lost Game 6 - Deep Blue vs Kasparov, 1997 -  to lose the match. This was the first time a computer had ever defeated a world champion in match play. In January 2003, he played and drew a six game FIDE Man - Machine WC (2003) match against Deep Junior (Computer) . In November 2003, he played and drew a four-game Man - Machine World Chess Championship (2003) against the computer program X3D Fritz (Computer) X3D Fritz, although he was constrained through the use of a virtual board, 3D glasses and a speech recognition system.\n<Human � classical> Kasparov played several matches apart from his matches in the World Championship cycles. Full details can be seen at Game Collection: Match Kasparov! .\n<Human � rapid> In 1998, Kasparov played a blitz match against Kramnik in Moscow, that match being drawn +7-7=10.  He fared better in the 2000 internet blitz match against Judit Polgar , winning one and drawing one. The following year, he played a blitz match against the many times Greek speed chess champion Hristos Banikas of Greece, winning  5 and drawing one. In his 2002 blitz against Elisabeth Paehtz in Munich, he won 6-0. Later in 2002, Kasparov lost a four game rapid match (+1 -2 =1) over two days in December 2002 in New York City against Anatoly Karpov. In 2009 in Valencia, Spain, he again played Karpov, and won the Kasparov - Karpov Rapid Match (2009) 3-1 and the Kasparov - Karpov Blitz Match (2009) by 6-2. In 2011, as part of his Chess In Schools campaign, he played a two game Kasparov - Lagrave Blitz Match (2011) in Clichy France, winning by 1.5-0.5. A few months later in October 2011, he won the Kasparov - Short Blitz Match (2011) 4.5-3.5 (+3 -2 =3), breaking the deadlock after game 7 by winning game 8 to win the match.\n<Simuls> In 1985, Kasparov played his first simul against a team, the Hamburg Bundesliga team lead by GM Murray Chandler , and lost 3.5-4.5, the first and only time he lost a simul against a team. In 1987, he played a simul against the same albeit slightly stronger team, but this time he was prepared and crushed the Hamburg players 7-1; later in 1987 he also crushed the Swiss team: Game Collection: Kasparov vs Swiss Team Simul by 5.5-0.5, drawing only with former World Junior Champion Werner Hug .  In 1988 he played a simul against the French team in Evry ( Game Collection: Kasparov vs French Team Simul ), winning 4, drawing one and losing one; he played the French team again in 1989 ( Game Collection: Kasparov vs French Team Simul 1989 ), this time winning three and drawing 3 games. Also in 1988 he played a simul against a group of powerful US Juniors, and won by 4-2 (+3 -1 =2)*****. In 1992, Kasparov played a clock simul against the German team ( Game Collection: Kasparov vs German National Team Simul which included former title contender Vlastimil Hort with whom he drew, winning 2 and drawing 2. He played a simul against the Argentinean team ( Game Collection: Kasparov vs Argentinian Team Simul ) winning (+7 -1 =4); in 1998 he played the Israeli team ( Game Collection: Kasparov vs Israeli National Team Simul ) winning 7-1, and in 2001 he played the Czech team ( Game Collection: Kasparov vs Czech National Team Simul ) in Prague, winning by +4 -1 =3.\nRating\nKasparov's ratings achievements include being rated world #1 according to Elo rating almost continuously from 1986 until his retirement in 2005. He was the world number-one ranked player for 255 months, a record that far outstrips all other previous and current number-one ranked players. Kasparov had the highest Elo rating in the world continuously from 1986 to 2005. However, Vladimir Kramnik equaled him in the January 1996 FIDE ratings list, technically supplanting him because he played more games. He was also briefly ejected from the list following his split from FIDE in 1993, but during that time he headed the rating list of the rival PCA. At the time of his retirement, he was still ranked #1 in the world, with a rating of 2812. In January 1990 Kasparov achieved the (then) highest FIDE rating ever, passing 2800 and breaking Bobby Fischer's old record of 2785. On the July 1999 and January 2000 FIDE rating lists Kasparov reached a 2851 Elo rating, which became the highest rating ever achieved until surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. There was a time in the early 1990s when Kasparov was over 2800 and the only person in the 2700s was Anatoly Karpov.\nOther\nUnder Kasparov's tutelage, Carlsen became the youngest ever to achieve a FIDE rating higher than 2800, and the youngest ever world number one. Kasparov also assisted Anand�s preparation for the Anand - Topalov World Chess Championship (2010) against challenger Veselin Topalov . Since his retirement, Kasparov has concentrated much of his time and energy in Russian politics. He is also a prolific author, most famously his <My Great Predecessors> series. His politics and authorship are discussed at some detail in the wiki article and at his official website cited below. In 2007, he was ranked 25th in The Daily Telegraph's list of 100 greatest living geniuses and has won 11 Chess Oscars.\nKasparov has been married three times: first to Masha, with whom he had a daughter, Polina (b. 1993), before divorcing; to Yulia, with whom he had a son, Vadim (b. 1996)  before their 2005 divorce; and to Daria, with whom he also has a daughter, Aida (b. 2006).\nBiography: http://www.kasparovagent.com/garry_... Kasparov�s official website: http://kasparov.com/ Kasparov Chess Foundation: http://www.kasparovchessfoundation.... ]\nJan-20-05\n  \nyoozum : Guys, as I found out yesterday, CG.com wants the bios as short as possible, while still covering his life.\nThe match scores, current strength, which tournaments he won, etc.. are quite irrelevant. If you're looking for a more complete bio, search elsewhere.\nJan-20-05    centercounter : Ironically, Kasparov's withdrawal sort of accomplishes what FIDE could not - a unified champion.  With the lack of credibility of the FIDE KO \"WC\" in Libya (no disrespect to Kasimdzhanov, or to his fine result), this makes Kramnik pretty much the only game in town.  Although a Kramnik-Anand WC match would be very welcome :)\nIf FIDE and ACP are serious about unification, my suggestion is that a round-robin tournament might be held in a neutral location (Iceland, Switzerland, etc.) with the top 16 players by FIDE rating, no \"president's nomination\" and no right of the host country to seed extra players.  If a player declines to participate, the tournament goes on with less players, the next player in the FIDE rating list would not be seeded.\nThe top 4 players from that event could then be broken into 1-3 and 2-4 and the winners of those matches could play for the WC.  No rapid or blitz tiebreakers, all games with a legitimate time control.\nA huge prize fund for the tournament part is not necessary - the top 4 will have cemented their position and have earned the right to command appropriate compensation in future events, in addition to receiving more lucrative earnings in the matches.\nJan-20-05    Dedalus : centercounter: I agree.\nThis settles thing in some strange fashion... Now it must be clear for everyone that the WCH is Kramnik - and that he, in fact, just recently defended his title in a very exciting match vs (probably, in my opinion, maybe alongside Kasparov) the strongest challenger around right now).\nJan-20-05\n   Appaz : Actually, I thought his name was Harri or Harry Weinstein. But that could just be a matter of translation.\nJan-20-05    yoozum : It may have something to do with the fact that American H's are pronounced \"G\" in Russian. And W is pronounced as V.\nex.\nJan-20-05    Backward Development : http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp...\nFIDE strikes back! (cue Darth Vader music)\nJan-20-05    aw1988 : <The World Chess Federation (FIDE: http://www.fide.com ) regrets Garry Kasparov�s announcement to withdraw from playing the World Chess Championship match against Rustam Kasimdzhanov at the scheduled dates of April 25th to May 14th 2005.\nDuring the latest FIDE congress in Spain, the Turkish Chess Federation expressed its strong desire to organize this match. FIDE informed the General Assembly that the Turkish bid was actively supported by the former world champion Garry Kasparov who urged FIDE to �give somebody else the authority to act unless FIDE already has the money from the Dubai organizer�. On 2 December 2004, FIDE entered discussions with the Turkish Chess Federation and requested the necessary bank guarantees before signing any agreement or issuing player�s contracts. Garry Kasparov had made it clear several times that he would not sign anything before he receives �acceptable� financial guarantees.\nDuring the negotiations with the Turkish Chess Federation Garry Kasparov and World Champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov were kept fully informed about all developments. They knew that:\na) FIDE authorized the Turkish Chess Federation on December 7 to secure the necessary funds in order to organize this match in Turkey with an initial deadline of 29 December.\nb) On 3 January 2005 the Deputy Prime Minister of the Turkish Republic, Mr Mehmet Ali Sahin, informed FIDE in writing that Turkey is ready to provide all necessary guarantees for the organization of the match, including the prize fund of 1.000.000 USD, organizational costs, etc.\nc) Following this letter of the Turkish Deputy Prime Minister, FIDE gave the Turkish Chess Federation a new deadline of 18 January for the issue of bank guarantees of 200.000 USD for each player and 50.000 USD for FIDE. The total amount of 1.272.000 USD would have to be transferred to FIDE�s bank account no later than 25 March 2005.\nMeanwhile, both players agreed that the match would begin on 25 April 2005.\nA few days ago, the representative lawyer of the Turkish Chess Federation, Mr Cemal Dursun, informed Garry Kasparov that no bank guarantees could be issued before 25 January. After receiving this information, Garry Kasparov sent an email to FIDE on 18 January announcing that he is no longer available to participate in this match for the dates that had been agreed (25 April � 14 May).\nIt is obvious that we are facing again a stalemate situation concerning the realization of the Prague Agreement, a situation for which FIDE cannot be held accountable. The official letter of the Turkish Deputy Prime Minister represents for FIDE a strong guarantee in order to provide the Turkish organizers with the necessary time to deal with the formal procedures concerning the issuance of the required financial guarantees.\nGarry Kasparov, who for a long time has sincerely co-operated towards the realization of the Prague Agreement, should have at least shown his respect to his opponent Rustam Kasimdzhanov and his appreciation for the efforts of the Turkish Chess Federation and the Turkish Government before announcing his unilateral decision to withdraw from this match.\nIt has to be clear to everyone that it is impossible to secure such high prize funds from legitimate sponsors, acceptable to FIDE and the IOC, without providing the candidate organizers with the necessary time to complete their efforts, especially when the government of a country is the guarantor for the organization of the match. It is even more difficult to secure these prize funds when the participants demand excessive financial guarantees before committing themselves in writing.\nFIDE continues to seek solutions concerning the funding of the World Chess Championship, in co-operation with its national federations and in close contact with all interested parties.>\nJan-20-05    dafish298 : yea i was right..see fide wont throw in the towel..i would think kasparov would accept this but who knows he could be stubborn\nJan-20-05    centercounter : While probably not feasible, perhaps he should speak either through his representation or directly with the representative of the sponsoring organization in Turkey.  FIDE has lost credibility with Garry (Garri?  Harri?) and it's important that he receive information from a source he feels is more reliable, or at least is a more direct source.\nFailing that, FIDE could be stringing him along hoping for a miracle or they could really have made the stated progress, and Kasparov is simply frustrated with the misinformation, miscommunications, and absence of communication he perceives coming from FIDE.\nNot being either Kaspy or a FIDE rep, myself, I can only give opinions on what I read and do not know the facts and the feelings firsthand ...\nJan-20-05    Sylvester : If Kasparov and Kramnik just held a unification match it would generate a lot of interest.  They would not need a large purse.  The winner could cash in later. A clear Champion would make the next match much more attractive to the money people.\nJan-21-05    ughaibu : Unification is between Kramnik and Kasimdzhanov. Kasparov has nothing to do with it, he's not the champion of either side.\nJan-21-05    dafish298 : I want to see kasparov play in a title match, because everytime he does he brings out an opening he never plays and revolutionizes it or wins with it. I.E. The sicilian dragon against anand in '95 (he won twice and drew 1 or 2 i think)\nJan-21-05    Poisonpawns : Nice picture chessgames! Kasparov`s Suit,teeth,and the chessboard in the backround match :-)\nJan-21-05    GazoGypsy : <yoozum:Not surprisingly, FIDE uses this as an opportunity to pass most of the blame on Kasparov. I wish we could finally get some objective facts about this.> The only relevent facts I see are Ilyumshinov is attempting to reign in the last mavarick Kaspy to complete his world domination, Garry would love to be the unified Champ, but I don't believe that would be in Ilyumshinov's best interest.  Unfortunately Kasporov's withdrawal hurts him a lot more than it hurts FIDE and or Kirsan.\nJan-21-05    GazoGypsy : Garry if your reeding this - Not all of are blind to the politics behind the game and you have our support and encouragement.  Good on ya'\nJan-21-05    tinashawn499 : Kasparov made the best move!  By eliminating himself from the current confusion of the WC match he may in fact be able to unfiy the title quicker.  There is no reason why FIDE should not schedule a match with Kramink now.\nJan-21-05    centercounter : Actually, it was all the stop and go scheduling of the match with Kasimdzhanov that hurt Kasparov.  He does not need this to prove anything.  He is not hurting for money (I would assume) and his place among the greats in chess cannot be put into question.\nThe cycle should start anew with a proper qualification system. In today's world, interzonals are just not feasible in the form some of us old-timers remember, but the structure needs to be analyzed and rebuilt in some manner to restore credibility.\nFIDE and the ACP both have their agendas, and would profit from meeting and working together not as independent agencies, as it appears is being attempted (badly), but as one group.\nJump to page #\n\n"
