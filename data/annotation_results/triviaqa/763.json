I wonder if he is any relation to John Jacob Astor who, as we all know, went down with the Olympic's sister ship? With a name like Waldorf, I recokon it cannot be mere co-incidence.\nThe Times report also, prophetically, says that the Olympic is insured for a million pounds and that her watertight compartments don't make her immune from loss. It remarks that the effect of the sinking of the Republic in 1909 to London's insurance markets would be:\n\"a fleabite as compared with what would have happened had the Olympic seriously come to grief in the Atlantic\"\nOne wonders if someone somewhere had a crystal ball?\nStuart\nEliza 1801-1838),\nand an unnamed son (1802, died).\nFourth child and second son William Backhouse Astor was the grandfather of John Jacob Astor IV, who died on the Titanic, and William Waldorf Astor, who founded the British line of Astors and was the father of the the member of Parliament Waldolf Astor.\nHere are the 7 children of William Backhouse Astor (1792-1875) and his wife Margaret Rebecca Armstrong:\nEmily (1819-1841),\nJohn Jacob Astor III (1822-1890),\nLaura (1824-1902), who married Franklin H. Delano, and became the aunt of Sarah Delano, the mother of FDR,\nMary Alida (1826-1881),\nWilliam Backhouse Astor, Jr (1830-1892),\nHenry Astor (1830-1918),\nand Sarah (1832, died).\nTheir oldest son John Jacob Astor III married Charlotte Augusta Gibbes and they had one son, William Waldorf Astor (First Viscount).\nJJA III's brother William Backhouse Astor, Jr. married Caroline Webster Schermerhorn and they had five children:\nEmily (1854-1881),\nCaroline Schermerhorn (1861-1948),\nand John Jacob Astor IV (1864-1912) who died on Titanic.\nWilliam Waldorf Astor (First Viscount), cousin of JJA IV, married Mary Dahlgreen Paul and they had five children:\nWaldorf Astor (Second Viscount) (1879-1952),\nPauline (1880-1972),\nJohn Rudolph Astor (1881, died),\nJohn Jacob Astor V (Baron Astor of Hever) (1886-1971),\nand Gwendolyn Enid (1889-1902).\nIt was William Waldorf Astor who established the English line of Astors.  After a bitter argument with his cousin Caroline (JJA IV's older sister), William moved his family to England in 1891. He became an English citizen in 1899.\nSon Waldorf Astor (Second Viscount), the nephew of JJA IV, was Oxford educated.  He married the beautiful Nancy Langhorne in 1906. He became a member of the House of Commons from Plymouth in 1910 and in 1916 he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Prime Minister Lloyd George. His political career soon stalled, however.\nIn 1919 his wife Nancy ran for the Parliamnent from Plymouth and became the first woman in the House of Commons.\nThe Astor line is often confusing.  Note that JJA II had no children, while his brother William Backhouse Astor was the father of JJA III.   JJA III's son was William Waldorf Astor, while his brother William Backhouse Astor Jr's son was JJA IV.  William  Waldorf Astor had a son JJA V (younger brother of Waldorf), while the son born posthumously to JJA IV was named JJA VI.\nLater, Waldorf Astor (Second Viscount) would have a son named JJA VII, but none of his younger brother JJA VI's three sons would carry the JJA name.  Instead, the grandson of JJA V would become JJA VIII.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nJohn Jacob Astor was born in Waldorf, ... , who became the first woman Member or Parliament. ... helps us understand John Jacob Astor IV when he writes in ... The Astor Bloodline - theforbiddenknowledge.com The Astor Bloodline\nThe Astor Bloodline\nThe       original founder of the Astor fortune was John Jacob Astor (1763-1884).       John Jacob Astor was born in Waldorf, Duchy of Baden (Germany) from a       Jewish bloodline. The Jewish origins have been hidden, and quite a number       of various ideas of the Astorï¿½s heritage have been put into circulation       by the Astor's. John Jacob Astor was a butcher in Waldorf. In 1784, he       came to America after a stop over in London, England.\nAlthough       the story is that he came to America penniless--and that may be true--he       soon joined the Masonic Lodge, and within 2-3 years had become the Master       of the Holland Lodge No. 8 in N.Y. City. (This Holland Lodge is a       prominent lodge in that many of its members have good connections to the       Illuminati elite. An example of just one Lodge #8 member is Archibald       Russell, 1811 - 1871, whose father was President of a real hotbed of       Illuminati action for many years: The Royal Society of Edinburgh). By       1788, Astor was a master of Masonic lodge#8. This is rather interesting       considering Astor could not speak English when he arrived in America, and       supposedly was very poor.\nJohn       Jacob Astor was always very famous for being coldhearted, anti-social,       ï¿½a man who didnï¿½t have charm, wit or grace.ï¿½ (This quote comes even       from a relative of the DuPont family who wrote a sympathetic Biography       entitled The Astor Family.) If this man lacked social graces and was so       cold, and was so poor during his first years in the U.S., why did he rise       to such prominence in Freemasonry ? Certainly not because of his social       graces. For instance, one time later in life at a meal given for elites,       when his hands got dirty at the table he reached over and used the shirt       of the man beside him to wipe his hands. \nThe       original financial break came by carrying out a series of shady and       crooked real estate deals in the N.Y. city area. The next break came when       two men who are now known to have been in the Illuminati gave John Jacob       Astor a special government privilege. The two men were Pres. Jefferson and       Secretary Gallatin--both Illuminati members. The United States government       had placed an embargo on all U.S. ships from sailing with goods in 1807.       But Astor got special permission from these two men for his ship to sail       with its cargo. His ship sailed and made close to a $200,000 profit in       that dayï¿½s money. Astor strangely profited greatly from the War of 1812,       which crippled almost all the other American shippers.\nAstor       also worked together with George Clinton, another member of the       Illuminati, on land deals. Even at that period in history, British       intelligence worked for the Committee of 300 and for the Thirteen Top       Families, it is interesting then, that John Coleman who had access as an       intelligence agent to secret documents, discovered that the original John       Jacob Astor was also a British secret agent. The Thirteen Families have       very intimate roles with the American and British intelligence cults.       Prior to 1817, John Jacob Astor entered into the fur trade and remained       the biggest player in the fur trade until he got out of it in 1834. Over       the years, he had managed to build up a monopoly. How he managed to push       everyone else out is a good question. Bear in mind, white people had been       trapping furs in the New World for several centuries, and the Indians for       who knows how long. Then this guy Astor comes along and in a few years       totally owns the whole industry! Again this could only have happened,       because the occult power of this Astor family gave them the right.       Obviously, others in the Committee of 300 had to step aside, if his       position in the hierarchy had not given Astor the right, believe me the       other families that originally controlled the fur trade would have gotten       rid of Astor.\nOne       result of his fur company, was that Astoria, OR was created. Today,       perhaps in honor of the family that originally took interest in it,       Astoria is a real hot-bed for the secret Satanic covens in Oregon. John       Jacob Astor did have a few helpful connections. Three of his relatives       were captains on clipper ships. He had connections in London to the       Blackhouse family. He married a Todd, a family frequently associated with       Satanism. His wife, a Todd, was also connected to the influential Brevoort       family. And finally for some reason, John Jacob Astor was also on good       relations with the politicians of the day, perhaps because most of them       were Freemasons too.\nFor       a few years John Jacob Astor had participated in the opium trade, but in       1818-he publicly quit running opium to China. John Coleman in his good       book The Conspiratorï¿½s Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300, p.       131 notes, ï¿½John Jacob Astor made a huge fortune out of the China opium       trade .... it was the Committee of 300 who chose who would be allowed to       participate in the fabulously lucrative China opium trade, through its       monopolistic BEIC, and the beneficiaries of their largess remained forever       wedded to the Committee of 300.ï¿½ Interestingly another Top 13 family,       the Russell's , was also one of the lucky ones to get a slice of the China       opium trade. It is clear repeatedly from history that Astor was privy to       inside information in the government, and maintained his own courier       system. John Jacob Astor bought up large amounts of land in NY which land       greatly increased in value. The Financial Panic of 1837 allowed him to       foreclose on a large number of mortgages. John Jacob Astorï¿½s wealth       continued to skyrocket. As one biography said, ï¿½When it came to a       question of principle versus profit, Astor was a practical man.ï¿½ Put       simply, he had no scruples. Astor had a reputation for being a ruthless       landlord. He also had the reputation of not paying his legitimate debts.\nAstor       became a banker, and sat on the board of 5 directors of the new national bank that Hamilton created for the U.S. government called the Bank of the       United States. Astor owned a large block of the stock of the Bank of the       United States. Astor also was fairly active during his life as a       Freemason, holding several more key positions in the secret lodge life.       John Jacob was the richest man in the United States. Note this reference.       Meyers, Gustavus. History of the Great American Fortunes. London:       Stationers Hall, 1909, p. 147 said, ï¿½Statistics issued in 1844 of       manufacturers in the United States showed a total gross amount of       $307,196,844 invested. Astorï¿½s wealth, then, was one-fifteenth of the       whole amount invested throughout the territory of the United States...ï¿½       Is having 1/15th of all of what American money is invested not rich? John       Jacob Astorï¿½s descendents had a penchant for secrecy, and set up things       to rule from behind the scenes. In contrast, to some of the other top       families, the Astor's preferred not to sit on boards of corporations they       controlled. In 1890, a real estate expert calculated the Astor's owned       1/20 of New York City real estate. After making their fortune while       residing in the New York area, the Astor's by and large have all gone to       England. They still wield great financial power in the United States       through proxies. Forum Magazine, Nov. 1889, commented that authorities       estimated the Astor's were worth $300,000, but that that figure had to be       an underestimate. Today, my estimate of the Astor's is that they are worth       about 40 billion dollars.\nOne       of the many foundations that the Astor's created was the Vincent Astor       Foundation, which is controlled from England by the Astor's and has in the       range of $100 million tax exempt dollars. The Vincent Astor Foundation has       typically given to Catholic and Episcopalian needs, among other things.       They also give money to agencies opposed to private ownership of guns.       They give money to NYï¿½s public library. Imagine how much influence that       gives them, when the library is receiving regular help for general       support? A 1971 Foundation Directory stated that the V. Astor foundation       had its present emphasis on preventing juvenile delinquency. Why donï¿½t I       trust the Astorï¿½s in helping out with law enforcement? The William       Waldorf Foundation states that its purpose is ï¿½Promotion of mutual       understanding and the diffusion of knowledge and culture among the United       States and the dominions, colonies, and countries of the British       Commonwealth.ï¿½ This sounds very similar to the public statement of       purpose that the secretive Pilgrim Soc. has given out to those who need       something about them. Assets for this foundation are a mere $64,000.       Vincent Astor (now deceased) was a member of 41 private clubs, To give an       idea of how much power just one of the many Astor men wield some of the       businesses Vincent was involved include: director- American Express       Company dir. Atlantic Fruit and Sugar Co. dir. Chase Manhattan Bank (of       the Rockefellers) dir. City and Suburban Homes Co. dir. Classical       Cinematograph Corporation dir. Cuban-Dominican Sugar Co. dir. Great       Northern Railroad dir, Inter. Mercantile Marine Co. dir. National Park       Bank of NY dir. NY County Trust Co. dir. Weekly Publications Inc. dir.       Western Union Telegraph trustee NY Zoological Soc. advisor to Bankers       Trust of NY member Amer. Museum of Nat. History member Nat. Institute of       Social Sciences (notice these last two like so many elite controlled       organizations are heavily involved in the spread of the evolution theory.)\nJust       like the Rothschild's, DuPont's, and Rockefellers, the Astor's always set       one of their Astor males as the head of the entire family. This headship       is passed down as a birthright within the different branches of the       family, just as any King passes on his throne. On the corner of 33 rd St.       and 5th Ave. (the site later began the site of the Empire State Building)       the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel was built by William Waldorf, et. al.       The hotel opened in Mar. 1893. It is described as ï¿½the ultimate in snob       appeal.ï¿½ Later two Astor cousins built the Astoria (another even taller       elite Hotel) in New York which opened in 1897. Of course, like many of the       other elite families, the Astor's have their Maine property to get away       and relax. In 1894, John Jacob wrote a novel A Journey in Other Worlds       where he describes a society which operates on the idea of conserving       energy. Strange how the elite likes to promote conservation among us       ï¿½cattle.ï¿½ In the late 1800ï¿½s, the Illuminati began to reconfigure       its outward face. The higher levels started creating innocent sounding       cover organizations to hide their meetings behind. In 1901, the Astor's       contributed toward the creation of the Pilgrim Society, which was the       cover organization for Amer. & Brit. 6ï¿½ Princes of the Illuminati. I       believe at least five Astor's are now members of the Pilgrim Society. The       Pilgrims had recently included David Astor, John Jacob Astor 8th, and       William Waldorf Astor 3rd. And during the 1970s, Baron Astor of Hever was       the President of the London branch of the Pilgrims. This implies that       Astor of Hever was at least the next level up in the chain of command. The       Astor's also have been very prominent in the Groupï¿½ which is Britain's       equivalent to the Skull & Bones Soc. In Britain, the Astor, along with       about 20 other families dominate the Group, just as certain families like       the Whitney's in the U.S. help dominate the Order of Skull & Bones .\nAgain,       as was earlier pointed out, the key to understanding Satanism is the       bloodlines. In 1910, the muscle and bone branches of the Illuminati       reconfigured themselves with the creation of the Round Table groups in       1910. The Astor's were the part of the financial backers behind the Round       Table groups along with Abe Bailey. Rhodes and Milner were key players in       setting up The Society of the Elect, a super secret top circle of       Illuminati. Rhodes Trust in part helped by the Astor, helps finance the Rhodes Scholarship system . Rhodes a high ranking Freemason wanted the       Masonic clap-trap as part of these various new groups, but Milner and       Brett did away with the Masonic rituals and costumes, etc.\nIn       1919, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA) was created. And       the Astor's were the major financial backers of the RIIA which functions       as the 4ï¿½ cover of the Illuminati. For those who are new to this, the       RIIA is the British equivalent to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)       which takes a major role in the policy making process in the U.S. Waldorf       Astoria was appointed to the RIIA. Just above the CFR/RIIA are round table       groups which were initially named by Cecil Rhodes as the ï¿½Association of       Helpersï¿½. Cecil Rhodes set up the Rhodes Scholarships to recruit and       bring top men from several nations to Oxford to be initiated into the       Illuminati and to learn about how to bring in a One-World-Government , So       the initial selection into the Rhodes program--1st degree of the       Illuminati - is equivalent to the initiation into the Skull & Bones.       In the picture you see how the Cliveden Astor's were intimately connected       to the Rhodes Scholars. Rhodes Scholars frequently went to the Cliveden       Estate. By looking at the genealogy chart you can see how the family in       London broke up into two powerful segments. One part centered around the       Cleveden Estate. Another group became Barons-the Astor's of Hever - or the       Hever Astor's for short. William Waldorf Astor owned the Pall Mall       Gazette, the Observer, and the Pall Mall Magazine. The London Times was       largely controlled by the Astor's, and since 1922 they have owned this       major source of British news. The DuPont's and the Rockefeller's also have       some major businesses where they too own blatant large holdings. However,       most of the wealth of the 13 Top families is hidden so that the ties to       who owns it are difficult to track. Hoyt Ammidon has been a proxy for       Vincent Astor and the other Astor's. (See membership list of Illuminati in       this newsletter). The Astor family also used Owen Lattimore as their proxy       for opium trade, who in turn used Laura Spelman who was funded by the       Institute for Pacific Relations (I. P. R.).\nThe       I. P. R was the group that supervised the Illuminatiï¿½s decision to allow       Red China to share in the Opium trade. The puppet strings behind big world       events may not be seen by the public, but if we trace the origins of       several big events we see the Astor's helping pull strings. The I. P. R       helped lay the groundwork for the Pearl Harbor attack. The Astor's also       were behind the appeasement policy in Europe which allowed Hitler to       become a threat. The Astor's were also involved in the Temperance movement       against alcoholic drink which was begun by the Womenï¿½s Christian       Temperance Union. The Temperance movement was an elite created movement       just like today we have big issues like Apartheid which are made up by       them to keep us busy. Joseph Kennedy and Onassis, two other top 13       Illuminati families got rich off of the Temperance movement by       bootlegging. So many people have exposed the Temperance movement (See       Occult Theocracy for just one expose of Freemasonryï¿½s involvement) that       it is not pertinent to cover it here. Todayï¿½s equivalent of the       Temperance movement is the drug war. Col. Jack Astor, one of the worldï¿½s       most powerful men, was among those who went down with the Titanic. To his       honor, he didnï¿½t have to sacrifice his life, but did. If he had been a       scoundrel he could have chased a woman and her children from some       lifeboat. Many sermons have been preached on the significance of the       Titanic, and I personally am beginning to feel that God laid it on the       hearts of so many of his ministers to understand that the Titanic was a       judgment upon the pride of the world. More specifically it was a warning       to the New World Orderï¿½s elite. Another Illuminati invention was       Communism. This has been so thoroughly documented I donï¿½t know why I       have to state it here, except that there are still people who havenï¿½t       taken the time to study it out. James II. Billingtonï¿½s book Fire In the       Minds of Men - a very scholarly work, and Occult Theocracy are some good       starting points to study this. The Fabian Society was also connected to       the Illuminati. For instance, Illuminati prince Prof. George Edward Gordon       Catlin, Pilgrim Soc. member was a member of the Fabian Societyï¿½s       executive committee. The Fabian logo is a Wolf in sheep's clothing!!!\nFabians       like H. G. Wells who wrote so eloquently on the New World Order with such       books as The New World Order, A Modern Utopia, The Open Conspiracy Blue       Prints For A World Revolution was a wolf in sheep clothing. H. G. Wellï¿½s       made the New World Order something that sounded advantageous to everyone,       a Utopia of sorts. That is not what it will be. During the 1930ï¿½s, the       Fabian Socialists created the Political and Economic Planning group (PEP).       Mason Viscount Waldorf Astoria was a leader of PEP. A confidential program       that the PEP created and implemented through the British government was       later described in a book Principles of Economic Planning in 1935. The       book doesnï¿½t explain why its cover has a Masonic square and compass       ostensibly displayed on its cover. George Bernard Shaw, who was a       communist and Fabian Socialist was the best friend of Lady Nancy Astor,       who became the first woman Member or Parliament.\nThese       two spend vast amounts of time together, much more than Nancy did with her       husband Waldorf who she didnï¿½t care to be around. Waldorf was the Mason       that was mentioned earlier who helped lead PEP. After Nancy Astor was       elected (or selected by the elite) to be the first lady MP, one of the       Russell lady's soon afterwards also became an MP. Communism pretends it is       the enemy of the rich capitalists, but both the rich elite and the       communist leaders are committed to wipe out Christianity, to wipe out free       trade with monopolies, and to set up an Illuminati One-World-Government. Do you see they have similar goals? A picture is included of Waldorf and       Nancy Astorï¿½s visit to Russia during the 1930s. The Astor's were not       treated like enemies but like royalty. Can we see how the elite controlled       press have deceived us? Do not trust our Illuminati-controlled elite to       protect us from communism, they control communism. Besides socialism,       Nancy Astor was a big supporter of Christian Science. Christian Science       was a front for witchcraft from Its very beginning. For more information       on what Christian Science is about I suggest people study Be Wise As       Serpents, chapter 2.6 ï¿½The Healing Lightï¿½. Nancy Astor wrote The       Natural History of the Vampire and a book on the early Mason/Communist       Bakunin. She used Grenfell family papers. The Grenfell family were close       friends to the Cliveden Astor's. David Astor, (The Honorable) attended       Bilderberger meetings in 1957 and 1966. Alpha Lodge is the lodge in       England that is traditionally for royalty. There are other elite lodges       too, where the those of the elite, can protect themselves from rubbing       shoulders with those of less social stature. These are the type of Masonic       lodges that the Astor's Join.\nIn       summary, an examination of the Astor family reveals their close       connections with the full spectrum of Illuminati activities ranging from       Freemasonry, the Illuminati itself, the Pilgrim Society, the Round Tables,       Communism, Fabian Socialism, CFR, RIIA. the Bilderbergers, as well as the       various politically (that is Illuminati) tainted banks such as Chase       Manhattan. Ava Alice Muriel Astor was an occultist. She was born in 1902,       was pretty but also a very serious woman. She was a very strong willed       person that was able to dominate a person in her presence unless they were       also strong willed. She was into Egyptian magic and believed she was the       reincarnation of an Egyptian princess and a disciple of Ikhnaton. Alice       Astor may have been one of the first people to enter King Tutï¿½s tomb,       where she got herself a necklace. Aldous Huxley wrote Brave New World as a       picture of things that were to come --most people think as a expose, but       it was really more as a plan or blueprint Aldous Huxley and Alice did a       great deal of occult things together. Their financial power is unchecked.       Myers and others have noted the Astor's are above the law. The Top 13       families donï¿½t obey the law--they are the law. The Astor's may have       Illuminati Kings and Princes in their ranks, they may have dozens of       billions of assets, yet it will all be nothing when they face their       Creator at judgment.\nFDR       and Lady Astor - 2 socialists\nFollow       up on the Astor's\nOne       of the items that I felt I should have given the readers back in the       1/1/93 issue was the Masonic background of John Jacob Astor (1763-1848).       For the record here is his Masonic involvement: Master of the Holland       Lodge No.8, of N. Y. C.-1788 Grand Treasurer of the Grand Lodge of New       York-1796-1801 Junior Grand Warden on two occasions-1796 & 1801       Secretary of the comamandery (then called encampments). For a busy man, he       kept himself busy In his Masonic work.\nTHE       ASTOR FAMILY REVISITED WITH INFORMATION ON THEIR CHANLER BRANCH. THERE ARE       13 TOP BLOODLINES\nThirteen       families or bloodlines are at the top, and five of these families are the       inside core of these thirteen. Prior to Be Wise As Serpents, the existence       of thirteen top families was not known by very many people. The existence       of the 13 families had come out in Berry Smithï¿½s book Final Notice in       the 1980s, but the names were still unknown. Berry Smith of Australia       wrote in his book Final Notice p. 9, ï¿½There are 13 families or groups       heading up the World Government plan. These families are portrayed as the       13 layers of blocks found on the strange seal on the reverse side of the       U.S. $1 bill.ï¿½ In a little read article, one SRA victim recently wrote       that Satanism was controlled by a few families. Recently, one of the       DuPont's was on a television show because the DuPont's were trying to       kidnap him because they didnï¿½t like his support for the book Dope.       Inc.       I was able to get a copy of the book, and was overjoyed to find such an       excellent book. My sources have been telling me that the top Illuminati       families were behind the drug trade. Yes, Satanï¿½s top followers are also       the kingpins in destroying humanity for profit through drug trafficking.\nThe       following families (besides others) or individuals from these families are       mentioned in Dope Inc. as involved in some aspect of the drug trade: the       Astor's, Bundy's, DuPont's, Freeman's, Kennedyï¿½s, Liï¿½s, Rockefellers,       Rothschild's, and Russell's. It is no coincidence that nine of the Top 13       families would get there names in a book which revealed the big names       behind the worldï¿½s illegal narcotics trade. It should be mentioned that       some other prominent Illuminati families also play key roles in the drug       trade such as the Bronfman's, Cabot's, Shaw's, Bacons, Perkins, Morgan,       Forbes, Cisneros and Oppenheimer's. Where have we seen such names before?       There are names in Dope Inc. that people would do well to know the danger       of such as Louis Mortimer Bloomfield, Robert Vesco, Francois Genoud of       Switzerland, Ivan Slavkov of Bulgaria, the Duke of Kent - Master of the       Grand Mother Lodge of the Scottish Rite, and Jardine Matheson to mention a       few. All our favorite secret fraternal groups appear in Dope, Inc. too.       For instance, the Triads, P2 Masonry, regular Freemasonry, the CIA, the       Order of St. John, and the Jesuits . The Universal Christian Gnostic       Churchï¿½s which practices black magic has a whole chapter showing its       connection to the drug trade. Britainï¿½s assassination bureau Permindex       which has been mentioned previously in this newsletter also gets a chapter       in the book. In the Be Wise As Serpents book, I examine in detail only the       Rothschild's and the Russell's. I did not present much to back up my       statements about the 13 families. Further, One of the unthinkable items       that most people do not want to consider is that their leaders who they       have idolized may be utterly corrupt. There was nothing to do but sit down       and give the nitty-gritty details if the threat from the Illuminati was to       be properly understood. The facts would speak for themselves. The ideal       solution for both writer and reader was for me to write up my research and       for you to read it as a series of articles. There is only so much a person       can assimilate at once, and these articles give lots of details. In       January of this year I began a series of articles on the top 13 families -       families which the top experts said nobody knew about. I did this with the       hope of stimulating others to notice these families, and to alert a wider       sector of the Body of Christ. The young colleague David J. Smith, who       wrote part of the Jan. 1 article on the Illuminati, was led to carry out       further research in addition to what the Jan. 1 article had. Most of this       articleï¿½s information on the Astor's then is a result of Davidï¿½s       research.\nDIFFICULTY       IN DETERMINING THE FACTS. Most of the material put out on the Astor's       shows the unmistakable mark of distortion by writers and historians giving       information in line with what the Astor's wanted the public to get. Books       on the Astor's contain both believable and unbelievable material, fact and       fiction, Some of the real facts may remain obscured forever, but that has       not stopped us from getting the most accurate picture we could       reconstruct. The Astor's do not make the task of investigating them easy.       They have been very secret and very deceptive since they arrived In this       nation. John Jacob Astor, the first prominent Astor was a notorious liar,       ï¿½he was known on occasion to invent romantic tales for the edification       of people who annoyed him with questions ...... Men who knew him best       were, therefore, neither ready to discredit completely all legends about       his exploits nor to repeat them as gospel. The truth, they suspected, lay       somewhere between the two extremes.ï¿½ (Terrell, John Upton. Furs by       Astor., p. 102.) John Jacobï¿½s son insured that his fatherï¿½s lies would       go unchallenged by incinerating all of his personal records, business       records and other papers.\nORIGIN       OF THE FAMILY & its NAME The Astor's have come up with various origins       for themselves and those for or against the family have added more ideas.       One strong possibility is that the Astor's are descendants of the Astorga       family found in Southern Italy before the 1600s. The most likely meaning       of the name is that both Astorga and Astor are variations meaning       ï¿½Astarteï¿½ who is the mother of the occult. Her name is also Semiramis.       In Babylon the trinity was Nimrod (the sun), Semiramis (the moon), and       Tammuz (the morning star). In Egypt, these gods were called Osiris, Isis,       and Horus. The pictures and statues Isis and Horus were renamed by the       Roman Catholic church as the Virgin Mary and the Christ-child.\nTHE       FAMILY IN EUROPE The family may have moved from Savoy to Waldorf, Germany.       Although it is not a certainty, the best explanation from the available       clues indicates that Waldorfï¿½s coven had some important personages in       the witchcraft/satanic system and that Johann Astorï¿½s family had power.       At that time in Europe, the Astor family had no chance to turn their       occult power into success. The power and class structure In Europe was       rigid and grid locked. The boundaries between peasant and aristocracy were       solidly in place. So the family looked to the New World to transmute their       position in the Satanic hierarchy into financial wealth and power. Johann       Astor In Waldorf was only a butcher. His best son John Jacob (1763-1848)       was selected to establish the House of Astor in America.\nJOHN       JACOB ASTOR GOES TO AMERICA At age 16, John Jacob Astor quit helping the       family butcher business, went to England and then later to America.       Looking at the details of things, and piecing the truth together it       appears that his Satanic authority was already in place, because he was       able to travel to England, and as a German-speaking peasant converse face       to face with the Backhouse family in England. Of course the biographers       make it sound like John Jacob Astor left Germany for himself, rather than       his family. Michael Astor gives a glimpse of John Jacobï¿½s mission, ï¿½He       concentrated almost entirely on building a fortune, on escaping the       poverty of his childhood and establishing a secure financial position for       his family in America.ï¿½ (Astor, Michael. Tribal Feeling p. 11)\nOVERVIEW The process of 400 years looks like this. Various Satanic families moved       into the Southwest German area in the late Medieval time period.       Witchcraft associated with Diana was practiced In Southwest Germany, and       this began to alarm various elements of the Roman Catholic church. The       Astor family provides leadership in the covens in the Heidelberg area.       Witchcraft spread virtually all over Southwest Germany. An examination of       the old records from about 1500 to 1650 show that witchcraft was being       practiced throughout the area. (I have the names of over 120 towns were it       was practiced in SW Germany, the list derived from old German records.)       The Astor's did not have the position, wealth, and power that accorded       their position in the late 1700s of occult leadership. In Germany, England       and France there was no way to climb the social ladder. However, the New       World presented opportunities. The Astor's sent two sons to prepare the       way for John Jacob, one to England, one to America, and then sent John       Jacob their most promising brightest son to the New World.\nWhile       in America the Astor family helped the Satanic elite headquartered in       England to maintain its control over America. Having come from Germany,       and also due to Satanism being secret, John Jacob Astorï¿½s help given to pro-British-elite moves were more difficult to suspect. After establishing       themselves as aristocrats in America, the tribe of Astor's moved to       England, where because of their high social position in America, no one       questioned the Queen bestowing titles of nobility on them. All along the       process, people with Illuminati connections opened doors for the Astor's.       At this point, it needs to be pointed out that there were ties between the       following groups: English royalty, English Satanism, English Freemasonry,       and German witchcraft, and the Italian Black nobility. (Taking the liberty       I have as author of this article, I am going to digress to give some       examples of these connections. Although on the surface this doesnï¿½t       directly pertain to the Astor's, it does.) When one paints in the bigger       panorama of what was happening in the occult world, and then one sees a       blazing star streak across that panorama, then the real history of that       blazing star is given by tracking its voyage through that panorama.       However, the history books have intentionally hidden the significance of       so many of the players and groups that lay along the track of that blazing       streak.\nSPECIFIC       GROUPS\nOrder       of the Knights of the Helmet--This was an illuminated secret society with       Sir Francis Bacon at its head. In order to hide its Masonic rituals, Sir       Francis Bacon wrote a play entitled ï¿½The Order of the Helmet.ï¿½ This       was performed in 3 Jan. 1594, and again for twelve days in December 1594.       In Dec. 1594, British Aristocrats who had been demonically illuminated,       met and put on a ï¿½play.ï¿½ Calling their initiation ceremony a play was       a great cover. Sir Francis Bacon was made king and ï¿½prince of purple.ï¿½       Various men were invested with the Collar of Knighthood of the Helmet, and       took vows, And a ï¿½Series of Charges by six High Councilorsï¿½ was given       in a manner that is very similar to what the satanic S.R.I.A. does now.       The reader may ask what does this have to do with the Astor's? This is       simply a few brief look at the background of what was happening in the       occult in Europe. The Queen of England sent Sir Francis Bacon as a young       man in his twenties to the continent of Europe. Sir Francis Bacon toured       France in places such as Louvre, St. Cloud, Blois, Paris, and Poictiers,       He also traveled to Germany, Italy and Spain. He visited the various royal       courts, such as the court of Marguerite de Valois. Marguerite was married       to King Henry of Navarre. Her mother was the evil Catherine de Medicis.       Sir Francis Bacon also met with many secret       societies . At Margueriteï¿½s       court he spent time with ï¿½The Pleiadeï¿½ fraternity, which was a group       of 7 intellectuals.\nAccording       to the best biographer of Sir Francis Bacon, who was Alfred Dodd (Alfred       spent his entire life studying Sir Francis Bacon), Sir Francis Bacon was       initiated into a large number of secret occult societies when he was on       the continent of Europe. He learned kabbalistic magic, Egyptian mysticism,       Arabian mysticism, and the customs of the German Steinmetzin. (Dodd,       Alfred. Francis Baconï¿½s Life-Story. London: Rider & Co., 1988,       p.10.4.) This information has been provided to give some feel for how the       occult in Europe was in contact with its various parts, and that its       tentacles included many of the royal families.\nHell       Fire Club -- This was a secret Satanic cult which was associated with       early Freemasonry. When the connections became known between the Satanists       of the Hell Fire Club and the elite of Freemasonry, Freemasonry and the       elite made some radical moves. First, Freemasonry publicly proclaimed that       it had nothing to do with the Hell Fire Club. When the Hell Fire Club was       publicly disbanded by the government (acting on orders from people that       tied-in with the club). Later, quietly the club was reconstituted.       Phillip, 1 at Duke of Wharton (1698-1731) who was the second person of       nobility to be Grand Master of Englandï¿½s Freemasons (G.M. of the Grand       Lodge 6/1722-11/25/1723) was president of the Hell Fire Club. He was an       M.P, in the House of Lords. In 1726, he left England and was a basically       brought into ill-repute by the Masons, who distanced themselves from him.       George Lee, Earl of Lichfield was also another prominent Mason who was a       member of the Hell Fire Club. Benjamin Franklin, who was the head of the       American Freemasons in various capacities, and also the head of the       Rosicrucian's and a number of other secret occult groups was also a member       of the Hell Fire Club. Benjamin Franklinï¿½s Satanism was not mentioned in       my Be Wise As Serpents book, but he was an important Satanist who was part       of the Order of the Quest--that is the group which has been entrusted with       the plans for bringing in the New World Order of Satan. Remember that John       Jacob Astor was very involved with Freemasonry, as were a number of his       intimate friends such as N.Y. Governor DeWitt Clinton and General John A.       Armstrong. In regards to the Hell Fire Club, the Earl of Sandwich,       Benjamin Franklin and Sir Francis Dashwood were leaders in the Hell Fire       Club and were also Post-Master Generals of the British Postal Service, All       were Freemasons too. Their positions as Post-Master Generals allowed them       total access to the mail, and allowed them to spy on the communications of       the 18th century. The man who became Post-Master General after Dashwood,       who moved on to be a M.P, in the Br. Parliament, was the Mason John       Wilkes. John Wilkes took over in 1766 (in 1774 was Lord Mayor of London).       Wilkes then brought one of the original Hell Fire Club members, a friend       of his Willis Hill to help with the Postal Service. The next Post-Master       general was the totally corrupt man the Earl of Sandwich, who served until       1771. Benjamin Franklin spent the summers of 1772, 1773, and 1774 at       Dashwoodï¿½s estate in West Wycombe. The caves under Dashwoodï¿½s estate       at West Wycombe were used for satanic sexual rituals, which were       participated in by Benjamin Franklin.\nOrdo       Saturnus--This is an old secret satanic German order. In the last few       newsletters, I have been educating people on the meaning of Saturn. It       means Satan. This previous information helps us understand John Jacob       Astor IV when he writes in his book A Journey in Other Worlds, ï¿½The       souls of the righteous departed were found on Saturn, where, to a       background of weird music, pulsating hearts, luminous brains and centers       of spiritual activity quiver with motion.ï¿½ (A side comment: John Jacob       Astor IV had a reputation for his insatiable sexual lust to paw women.)       One of the people we have to investigate in relation to the Ordo Saturnus       is Valentine Jeune, who was John Jacob Astorï¿½s mentor in Waldorf,       Germany. Jeune may well have belonged to an organization such as Ordo       Saturnus.\nJOHN       JACOB ASTOR LEAVES GERMANY FOR ENGLAND & AMERICA John Jacob Astor       arrived in England and may well have been introduced In England to British       Intelligence by his brother George. At any rate, he got involved in       British intelligence which has always been closely linked to Freemasonry       and the elite. He spent time socially with the Blackhouse family which an       aristocratic family. How do you suppose such a supposedly destitute young       man could be accepted so easily into the Blackhouse social scene? This is       not explained by modern biographers. After four years, his brother George       then sent him to America to represent Georgeï¿½s music company. His       brother Henry met him when he arrived in 1784 at age 20 and introduced him       to the occult world in New York City. Thomas Backhouse & Co. was a       leading house in the lucrative fur trade. John Jacob Astor set out to       bring the fur trade under his own control. There is a tact that must be       faced. the eliteï¿½s Committee of 300, a secret legislative group of the       Illuminati, decided that John Jacob Astor could expand into the fur trade       and into the opium narcotics trade. Dope, Inc. shows that the Astor family       was the first American family to get into the Opium trade, and that their       opium trade had was a special privilege that most other American       businesses did not even try to compete with. Why? Dope, Inc. doesnï¿½t say       this but I know that it is because the Committee of 300 decides such       things, not free enterprise. American furs yielded 1000% profit in those       days. The privilege of fur trading was a pot of gold so to speak that the       Committee of 300 gave Astor, and it could only have happened because the       Astor family in Waldorf was already part of a principal satanic bloodline.       (The Illuminati members of the Astor family today use their influence to       help those of the Illuminati in their dope trade.) William Backhouse the       American representative of the London Backhouse family and John Jacobï¿½s       brother Henry were two of John Jacob initial contacts in the New World.       Soon John Jacob had met all types of people involved in New Yorkï¿½s       occult world. John Jacob married Sarah Todd. John Jacobï¿½s step-mother       Christina Barbara is described as ï¿½the perfect, cruel fairy tale       stepmother.ï¿½ John Jacob ï¿½raised the principle of self-interest to the       level of a philosophy and ..... claimed for himself a natural superiority       over his less able and less powerful fellow men, a sort of God-given right       to exploit the world and its inhabitants for his personal gain, This was       not mere cynicism, but a genuine belief that in some way [he was] among       the chosen people for whose convenience and advancement life was ordered       ..... Such people ... make history, but they also pervert it in human       terms because their world and the codes that govern it have nothing to do       with morality.ï¿½ (Sinclair, David. Dynasty The Astor's and Their Times.       p. 59) ï¿½Astor took Freemasonry seriously... [Gov. DeWitt] Clinton rose       unusually fast in the degrees, but the German Immigrant [John Jacob] who       talked at times as if he had marbles in his mouth was not far behind him.       Astor eventually caught up to Clinton...ï¿½ (Terrell. Furs by Astor, p.       84).\nDeWItt       Clintonï¿½s uncle George Clinton, who served as Jeffersonï¿½s       Vice-President was also a member of their Holland Lodge No. 8. Archibald       Russell of the Russell family, as well as two members of the elite       Livingstone family were members of this lodge too at the time. The       Livingstone family were participating in the Committee of 300 at that       time. One of my Masonic reference books states that business at the       Holland Lodge No, 8 was conducted in German. If so, why were all these       other men involved with it who apparently had English as their mother       tongue? In the 1/1/93 issue, Astorï¿½s dirty real estate deals and his       activity as a drug king-pin were discussed.\nHowever,       Astorï¿½s connivance to create a nation on the west coast wasnï¿½t. Thomas       Jefferson, who I have now come to realize was a part of the Illuminati,       was in on the plot. Jefferson said that he ï¿½hoped for the establishment       of an independent nation on the Pacific Coast, bound to the United States       by ties of blood, language, and friendship.ï¿½ The Northwest was to become       a sovereign nation under Astorï¿½s rule. The plan failed miserably due to       a variety of reasons. Another item that was missed in the earlier article       was how John Jacob Astor profited by using his own courier system and       powerful friends to profit from the War of 1812. Astor knew the War of       1812 was coming and he set himself up to profit from it in several ways.       (His Masonic brother and friend John A.. Armstrong 1758-1843 helped the       British war effort as the American Secretary of War. A descendent of       Johnï¿½s later married into the Astor's.) Astor himself helped the British       when he could profit by it.\nThe       two illuminati Jefferson and Gallatin gave Astor special sailing       privileges which netted him much profit. When war was declared against       Great Britain, Astor sent agents to the British forts in Canada to inform       them. This gave the British advance knowledge of the war, before the       Americans troops knew. This allowed the British to seize northern American       forts and to insure that the British had control of the regionï¿½s fur       trade. This was essential for Astor to get control of the fur market,       because then when the British furs were embargoed he had less competition.       He obtained special permission from the President to import all furs owned       by him and held in Canada before the war. He used this permission       illegally to trap new furs. When the war ended. Astor was able to heat       everyone else to Europe with his furs and make a killing. Astor cleared       his name of shame, by sending Washington, D.C. information about a mutiny       at a British fort which allowed the U.S. army to take advantage of the       enemyï¿½s weak condition to capture the area. John Jacob Astor traded in       guns, and his firearms were used in at least one-Latin American       revolution. Bear in mind Latin-American revolutions have all been planned       in Masonic Lodges. When employees of John Jacob Astor would trap for or       trade furs with the Astor fur houses, they would he paid with letters of       credit. Then Astor agents would he sent out to ambush and kill them, so       that the Astor Fur Company could save money. The deaths were blamed on       Indians. Zachary Taylor stated, ï¿½Take the American Fur Company in the       aggregate, and they are the greatest scoundrels the world ever knew.ï¿½       (Oï¿½Connor, Harvey. The Astor's p.44)\nWILLIAM       BACKHOUSE ASTOR This was the son of John Jacob Astor. He was infamous for       his rank treatment of thousands of people who rented from him in New York.       There were repealed riots by tenants who were opposed by the harsh filthy       living conditions in the buildings Astor owned, but their complaints were       consistently ignored by Astor and their riots suppressed by the police.       Only half of the children of his tenants lived to age 20. The Astor's were       deeply involved with the Tammany organization. William B. supported the corrupt administration of the infamous New York mayor, Fernando Wood. The       government at that time was a pack of corrupt men. When Wood was exposed,       Astor's involvement was overlooked. This is another example of Astor power.\nJOHN       JACOB III He was the son of William Backhouse Astor. He was just as       haughty, just as cruel, and just as corrupt as his father and grandfather       had been. He created ï¿½sweat shopsï¿½ for the poor masses living in his       New York tenements. He also supported corrupt politicians such as the       criminal ï¿½Bossï¿½ Tweed who ran NYC. The Tweed Ring stole millions of       dollars from the city of New York. Before they finally got caught and sent       to prison Mayor Tweed and gang cost the city $200 million. Again John       Jacob Astor IIIï¿½s power allowed his involvement to be basically       overlooked by the press, while Tweed went to prison for life.\nTHE       CHANLER BRANCH Most of the Astor's took off for England, but one branch of       the Astor's that is clearly involved in Satanism and the occult is the       Chanler family. The Chanler family have Astor blood via ï¿½Madieï¿½ Astor       Ward. The Chanlerï¿½s parents died at an early age, and the Rokeby Estate       in NY was given by the Astor's so that a cousin Mary Marshall could raise       the Chanler children. The Chanler family is one branch that clearly shows       all the earmarks of the Satanic hierarchy. The behavior of Robert Chanler,       Elizabeth Chanler and Armstrong Chanler have all the classic earmarks of       having MPD, and having suffered SRA. The Rokeby mansion that the Chanler       family lived in was a haunted house of the first rate. Fairies, ghosts,       signs and potents, and all type of occult activity takes place at this       mansion, When top rx-Illuminati members who have managed to escape       Satanism describe their home life, they mention that occult phenomena was       a natural part of home life. This certainly is what life has been like at       the Chanler Rokeby mansion. The Chanlers are not well known publicly but       have been part of the social scene of the elite. Theodore Roosevelt and       Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (of the elite Cabot family) were good friends of       the Chanlers. The Chanlers created the town Roanoke Rapids, North       Carolina. (At some point I hope to do an expose on the resort area in that       general area that is a ï¿½meat marketï¿½ for the Illuminati. Families like       the Bill Clintonï¿½s go down there every year for vacation to mingle with       other middle management families that the Illuminati use as lackeys.       Illuminati ï¿½scoutsï¿½ watch and choose who they want to use for       political office, etc.) A Whoï¿½s Who of the Astor orphans--the Chanler       family who are of interest to our study of the Illuminati will now be       given.\nJohn       Armstrong Chanler-married mystic novelist and morphine addict Amelie       Rives. ï¿½Once wandering in the twilight she asked wistfully, ï¿½Do you       think If I drank a whole cupful of warm, bubbly blood, I would see a real       fairyï¿½ ... Then there had been the period during which she suffered       anguish over the thought that Satan was banished from Paradise forever;       she prayed with tears that ultimately he might be pardoned and readmitted       to celestial bliss.ï¿½ (Thomas, Lately. The Astor Orphans: A Pride of       Lions p. 76.) John carried on spiritual experiments in what he termed       ï¿½esoteric Buddhismï¿½. Due to his obsession with this practice and a       business fight with his brothers they put him in an insane asylum. He       finally did get released. One has to wonder what the whole story was       behind the incarceration. His esoteric Buddhism or ï¿½x-facultyï¿½ was a       trance state where a spirit spoke or did automatic writing through him.       His eye color would change when this spirit worked through him.\nMargaret       Livingston Chanler retained the rights to Rokeby. She married into the       Aldrich family, which is another Illuminati family. The Aidriches now own       Rokeby.\nWilliam       Chanler was a friend of Tom Foley who was the Tammany district leader of       the Irish-Italian district east of city hall. Another friend was Jack       Follansbee. Jack Follansbeeï¿½s cousin was William Randolf Hearst, an       Illuminatus of the 6ï¿½ who got Billy Grahamï¿½s ministry going by       financing the first several years. The Hearst family is in the Illuminati.       One of the Rothschild descendants Don Hearst Bauer, has changed his name       to Don Hearst.\nWinthrop       Chanlerï¿½s wife, Amelie Rive, her father William Cabell Rives studied law       under Thomas Jefferson.\nTHE       ROOSEVELT CONNECTION The Roosevelt family has been connected to the Delano       family which Is a Black Venetian Noble family that goes back for many       centuries. The lives of these families also intertwine with the Astors.       Examples of the interweaving are: ï¿½ Franklin Hughes Delano--heir to a       massive whale oil fortune. He married Lavia Astor, daughter of the       original William Backhouse Astor. ï¿½ James Roosevelt Roosevelt-married       Helen Astor, daughter of William Backhouse, Jr. ï¿½ James Roosevelt--a       Freemason, he married the sister of Vincent Astorï¿½s wife.\nSUMMARY\nIn       our revisit to the Astor's, we have examined in more detail the early life       of John Jacob Astor and his connections to Satanism. We have touched on       his son and grandson who led the Astor family after John Jacob died. We       have seen more of their meanness and connections to corruption. We       examined how Satanism and the occult had a hold on England even back when       John Jacob Astor came to the New World. Three important occult       organizations of the 17th & 18th century were introduced. We have       looked at the Chanler family, a branch of the Astor family which is part       of Satanism. We also looked at how the Roosevelt's and Delano families       have been associated with the Astor's.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\n... a military officer who eventually became Commandant of the United States ...

Lady Astor - John Singer Sargent Lady Astor\nLady Astor\n \nLady Astor - Nancy Witcher Langhorne Astor, Viscountess (1879-1964) . \nShe was born  Nancy Witcher Langhorne, an American daughter of Chiswell Dabney Langhorne of Danville, Virginia. Her first husband was Robert Gould Shaw; they were divorced in 1903 and then she moved to England. Three years later she married Waldorf Astor (1879-1952). \nHer father-in-law, William Waldorf Astor, was the great grandson of John Jacob Astor. He became a naturalized British subject, bought Hever Castle -- pouring millions into restoring it, got elected member of Parliament in 1910, raised to peerage in 1916 (House of Lords), and then was created Viscount Astor in 1917. His son won his seat in the House of Commons. \nIn 1919 her father-in-law died. Nancy's husband succeeded his father as the second Viscount Astor of Hever Castle and he entered the House of Lords, vacating his seat in the lower House. \nNancy became a candidate for her husband's  vacant seat and won -- the first woman to ever hold a seat in the House of Commons. She would hold that seat, as a Conservative Member of Parliament until retiring in 1945, serving the Sutton division in Plymouth. One of her political legacies is of a champion of women's and children's rights.  A less flattering look at her political views paints her as an elitist who felt she and her social cast (the cultured elite) could better benevolently lead the rest of us commoners than we could lead ourselves.\nShe was known as a fierce debater. There is a famous exchange between Winston Churchill and Lady Astor when they were both staying at Blenheim Castle visiting the Marlboroughs . The two politicians had been at each other's throat all weekend when Lady Astor said, \"Winston, if I were your wife I'd put poison in your coffee.\" Whereupon Winston said, \"Nancy, if I were your husband I'd drink it.\" (1)  \nProvenance\n\n"
