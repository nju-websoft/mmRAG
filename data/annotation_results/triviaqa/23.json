For a woman, it also represents her father, and later her husband. The Sun is one of  the most important symbols in the birth chart, as much as the Ascendant, then the Moon (a bit less for a man), the ruler of the Ascendant and the fast-moving planets.\nIt's element is fire; it is hot and dry, it governs Leo, is in exaltation in Aries and is in analogy with the heart. It represents the boss, authority, beside the father and the husband ; the age of the Sun goes from 20 years old to about 40, following the Venus age when one is aware of his seductive power.\nTemperament : Bilious\nCharacterology : Emotive, Active, Secondary, passionate type.\nSun in Pisces\nYour deep intuition and your extreme sensitivity allow you to perceive naturally what others understand through analysis. You do not follow the norms in use, societal or educational models and you prefer to create a moral for yourself. A feeling of isolation may come from your ability to live emotions that are unknown to your entourage. This strong impressionability endows you with a sixth sense and acute feelings. In some circumstances, distance and detachment are needed in order not to get bogged down in the necessities of the moment, in useless transient struggles and in barren conflicts. Pisces work wonders. Your strength: a sharp intuition of underlying stakes, a sensitivity that turns ï¿½the spirit of the timesï¿½ into a real compass. All activities requiring stepping back are suitable for you. Before anyone else, you pick up the dangers of an adventure, the risks of defeats or of suspensionï¿½ with your clear-sightedness more than due to pessimism. Therefore, you may abandon an objective that is not yet obsolete. It is important that you protect yourself against unnecessary disenchantments. Pisces hide a perceptiveness that many claim to possess. But your low-key advices are formulated in a peculiar language. The person who can understand your dazzling intuitions is very lucky.\nSun in House XI\nWith the Sun in the 11th House of your natal chart, you are able to recreate the world, provided that you can rely on loyal friends. Your idealism prompts you to give of your best to great causes, and to believe in the virtues of friendship, dedication, and universal love. So many disillusions lie ahead of you! But also so many hopes and so many moments of exaltation! In some way, you feel that your mission is to change other people's life in order to enliven them and to restore hope. Friendship rules!\nSun Dominant\nIf the Sun is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Solarian: you loathe pettiness and Machiavellian manoeuvre, and you are fond of natural nobleness as well as of direct and honest attitudes. You endeavour to get out of muddled or dark situations as quickly as possible. Your need for transparency may lead you to make cut-and-dried judgments such as yes or no, and black or white. However, your honesty commands your entourage's consideration. At times, you come across as authoritarian. It is true that you never want to be thought of the notable absentee, and that you manage to make people pay attention to you, as well as to your plans and your assessments. To this end, the Solarian sometimes develops a great talent for placing himself under the spotlight without missing a single opportunity to arouse interest. Some other Solarians, although more discreet, still manage to be the focus of any debate, even in situations of exclusion. It is your way of being present even though you are actually not there... More than other people, you appreciate the esteem extended to you. It is useless to cheat with you, since in all areas you consider establishing enduring relationships only with those who love you, admire you, respect you, or express some degree of affection to you. Your will to straighten out your inter-personal relationships is your strength and sometimes, your Achilles' heel. You cannot achieve anything behind the scenes. Therefore, your comportment is marked with heroism, and your stands are devoid of ambiguity, in the sense that your commitments are unfailing, and your rebuffs, final.\nInterpretation of the 23ï¿½ Pisces symbolic degree\n\"Under a dark sky enlightened by a moon crescent and a flash of lightning, two men are wrestling.\" ( Janduz version)\nAssertive, courageous, and discerning character endowed with physical and intellectual strength. One is free to use one's personal qualities at the service or justice and the collective good, or on the contrary, in the pursuit of reprehensible goals. In both cases, many hurdles and setbacks disrupt one's happiness and success. However, thanks to one's fortitude, one can overcome ordeals with flying colours. It is in the dark hours of the night that danger lurks.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nIf you wish, you can receive immediately in your mailbox your detailed astrological portrait , a nice gift for yourself or for your close friends and relatives, who will deeply appreciate it.\nMoon 23ï¿½49' Libra, in House V\nMoon Aspects\nMoon opposite Uranus orb -2ï¿½09'\nSun inconjunction Moon orb -0ï¿½26'\nMoon square Pluto orb +2ï¿½29'\nMoon semi-square Neptune orb +0ï¿½24'\nPlanets: Moon\nThe Moon represents instinctive reaction, unconscious predestination, everyday mood, sensitivity, emotions, the feminine side of the personality, intuition, imagination. For a man, she represents his mother and later his wife, and his relationship with women in general. For a woman, the Moon is almost as important as the Sun and the Ascendant. Her element is water, she is cold and moist, she rules Cancer, is in exaltation in Taurus and is in analogy with the stomach.\nShe symbolizes the mother, wife, the crowd, the Moon is associated with birth and childhood. Tradition also matches her with the end of life, after Saturn the old age, it is thus customary to go back to one's place of birth to die: the end of life meets the very beginning.\nTemperament : Lymphatic\nCharacterology : Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Non-Emotive, non Active and Primary, Nervous or Amorphous type.\nMoon in Libra\nOn the day and at the time of your birth, the Moon was in the sign of Libra. You loathe violence. Your nature is sociable and you are keen to maintain harmony in your environment. You are sensitive to ï¿½the spirit of the timesï¿½, to prevailing trends and currents. Because you pick up the moods of the people who surround you, you can be diplomatic. As you adopt the characteristics of your environment, your may become vulnerable. Your surrounding models may influence your tastes and your habits: you readily espouse your entourageï¿½s standards and aesthetic concepts. You can take advantage of your strong sensitivity in order to express yourself through a ï¿½beyond the homeï¿½ activity that requires fineness, aesthetical sense, and good taste.\nMoon in House V\nWith the Moon is in 5th House, you never feel as good as when you are playing. Of course, adults' games are often disguised and marked by the seriousness of age. Short-lived pleasures, seduction enterprises, and dramatic postures are integral parts of your private world. You enjoy childhood and children. You feel that you can easily access their world. The vocations in which you are most likely to be successful are linked to this love for playfulness: teaching, education, theatre, etc.\nMoon Dominant\nIf the Moon is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Lunarian: the driving force behind your actions is mainly the pursuit of well-being and tranquillity. Your sensitive and romantic self lives on those periods of rest during which you let your imagination wander at will. This is your way of finding inspiration and balance. Nothing is allowed to disturb your feeling of fulfilment and security within a harmonious cell, be it a family or a clan. More than other people, the Lunarian is attached to those moments during which one forgets one's worries and lets oneself cast adrift aimlessly, with no other goal than to be lulled into an ambiance, a situation, or a perfect moment. Many people do not understand such absences and their meaning, which is to regain strength. These people readily describe you with such unflattering terms as apathy and nonchalance. Never mind! Some inspirations require surrendering as well as striking a balance derived from alternate action and passivity. Your qualities are expressed to the fullest in situations which demand familiarity and privacy. Your capacities to respect and blend into your environment is at least as valuable as some other people's aggressive dispositions. However, you are well-advised to avoid indolence and renunciation out of laziness or indifference.\nInterpretation of the 23ï¿½ Libra symbolic degree\n\"In the neighbourhood of a splendid tree on top of a rocky promontory, a centaur shoots arrows at snakes, which are running away in the grass.\" ( Janduz version)\nRighteous, humble, and independent character. One has the capacity to wisely manage private companies or institutions dealing with public interests. High-ranking positions in the ministry of Finance or the Central Bank are very favoured. However, since success often arouses envy one must beware of jealous people and steer clear of political intrigues, especially if in the natal chart, Mars is dominant. As a matter of rule, this degree is a splendid omen for happiness, wealth, and honour.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nIf you wish, you can receive immediately in your mailbox your detailed astrological portrait , a nice gift for yourself or for your close friends and relatives, who will deeply appreciate it.\nMercury 7ï¿½26' Я Aries, in House XI\nMercury Aspects\nMercury inconjunction Neptune orb +0ï¿½59'\nMercury inconjunction Mars orb -1ï¿½22'\nMercury sextile Saturn orb -4ï¿½54'\nPlanets: Mercury\nMercury represents communication, logical and rational mind, intellectual skills. Earth is its element, it is cold and dry, and it rules Virgo and Gemini, is in exaltation in Virgo and is in analogy with the arms, hands, nervous system.\nIt represents tradesmen, lawyers, messengers; the age of Mercury goes from 8 or10 years old to about 15..\nTemperament : Nervous\nCharacterology : Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Non-Emotive, Active and Primary, Nervous or Sanguine type.\nMercury in Aries\nMercury describes your relations, your communication skills and the way you relate to the external world. However, other astrological elements also influence these areas. The sign Mercury occupies is significant only if Mercury is part of your planetary dominantes. In your chart, Mercury is in Aries. You respond very quickly to the stimulations of your environment. Your mind is constantly on the lookout, searching for new information. Communication is a matter of spontaneity and emotions experienced day-to-day. You always have a quick retort, you are fond of debates and you are avid for novelties. The danger is that you may get carried away by an impulsiveness detrimental to your relationships. Beware of bad language!\nMercury in House XI\nWith Mercury in the 11th House, you seek intellectual contacts and friendships based on common centres of interest. Love may be platonic, and relationships, idealistic. You communicate in order to build a better world, at least at home, or at your door. Projects, such as promises and commitments, abound... But how many of them will materialise? Making friends is a game you are crazy about. This is fine, provided you are wary of superficial relationships.\nMercury Dominant\nIf Mercury is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Mercurian: the tradition points out the importance of communication. From idle but enriching chatters to observation gift, such a dominant endows you with a wide range of expression. Human beings have one thousand facets and one thousand masks they wear according to circumstances and the fortunes of the game of life. You take the role of an observer who is avid for novelties, discoveries, and surprises. Everything catches your attention and becomes an opportunity for new encounters, relationships, and learning. The world amazes you, amuses you sometimes, and stimulates your curiosity. Because the most important thing is to discover, and because you consider that each new situation is packed with potentialities, you try to fill the gaps in your knowledge. Although your open-mindedness may scatter your centres of interest, it also enables you to carefully avoid sticking to only one immutable and rigid view. The slightest sign enables you to perceive the other side of the coin, as well as the infinite complexity of people and of situations. On the human plane, you seek the dialogue and the information without which you know that you are not able to fully grasp the nature of your interlocutor. This keen interest in the Unknown sharpens your inter-relational skills. All these qualities are traditionally associated with Mercury.\nInterpretation of the 7ï¿½  Aries symbolic degree\n\"A man with a dagger in his hand tries to provoke a group of men who are quietly playing bowls. He is seething with rage because the players pay no attention to him.\" ( Janduz version)\nHot-tempered, quarrelsome and reckless character. One always wants to create conflicts, antagonise everyone, criticise other people's opinions, and stir trouble. One is heading for serious problems because of one's own animosity. A career requiring aggressiveness is an excellent outlet for these violent impulses and brings about success and fame. If in the natal chart, Mars and Mercury form hard aspects with this degree, it portends bad reputation and misfortunes caused by one's own brutality. If Saturn is in conjunction with this degree, it describes a person who chooses to live in poverty or who is a professional beggar.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nIf you wish, you can receive immediately in your mailbox your detailed astrological portrait , a nice gift for yourself or for your close friends and relatives, who will deeply appreciate it.\nVenus 13ï¿½38' Pisces, in House X\nVenus Aspects\nVenus opposite Neptune orb -5ï¿½13'\nVenus opposite Jupiter orb -4ï¿½02'\nVenus opposite Mars orb -7ï¿½34'\nSun conjunction Venus orb +9ï¿½45'\nVenus trine Pluto orb +7ï¿½41'\nVenus semi-sextile Saturn orb +1ï¿½18'\nPlanets: Venus\nVenus represents the way one loves, relationships, sharing, affectivity, seductive ability. For men, she also corresponds to the kind of woman he's attracted to (but not especially in marriage which is more symbolized by the Moon, Venus is the lover and not the wife). Her element is the Air, she is moist, rules Taurus and Libra, is in exaltation in Pisces and is in analogy with the kidneys, the venous system, the bladder, the neck.\nShe represents the artists, tradesmen, occupations linked to beauty and charm; the age of Venus goes from 15 to about 25 years old.\nTemperament : Sanguine and Lymphatic\nCharacterology : Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Emotive, non Active and Secondary type.\nVenus in Pisces\nVenus describes your affective life. On the day of your birth, she is found in Pisces. Your emotionalism is very strong and very unusual. You have your own manner to experience your emotions and your sensations, in an atmosphere that may be odd, you complicate your amorous lifeï¿½ and this is part of your charm, at the same time. On the chessboard of your sentimental life, quite strange games enfold. Your affectivity is subtle, fabulous and unusual: love reinvents everything and anything becomes possible when your heart is sincere. You dream of a complete fusion and of giving yourself totally. No rules, no moral or social code is more important than the feeling of shared passion and than living for your partner. Your affective life is complex, sometimes mysterious: you donï¿½t know why you love, or why you donï¿½t love any moreï¿½ Your sentimental life obeys a different logic than that of the external world. Love is elusive and fragile. Nothing is easier than to destroy a feeling and to forget a passion. Your sensitivity responds to an unknown call, a strange signal. Therefore, you may shift from intense and absolute feelings to cruel indifference. Although you donï¿½t know why, you are being transformed. The most difficult thing is to love a real being and not a shadow. You give yourself to persons who can understand and respect the fragile realm of your affectivity.\nVenus in House X\nVenus expresses her characteristics through the 10th House values. Your vocation is related to aesthetics, art, or decoration. Obviously, life does not always offer you the means to fully achieve your aspirations. Nevertheless, your Venusian qualities, namely charm, aesthetic taste, and receptiveness, remain valuable assets in order to assert your ambitions and to play a social role matching your true nature. You are endowed with a few artistic gifts, and an innate sense of beauty.\nVenus Dominant\nIf Venus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Venusian: you are a sensual and emotional person particularly receptive to the natural likes and dislikes aroused by your contact with people. You are prone to frequent instinctive aversions and true passions which are exclusively driven by the feeling of love. The heart has its reasons which Reason knows nothing of... Your balance is based on the richness of your affective life. Without love, the Venusian is resourceless, lost, and deprived of any reason for living. You have an obvious and strong will to charm and to arouse the attachments without which you cannot properly function. Every area of your life is thus marked by your affectivity. The danger is that you may \"be taken in\" by charm. In such cases, you would prefer to keep your emotions under better control. Thus, hyper-sensitivity has its own inconveniences. Nevertheless, better than anyone else, you know how to play with feelings and attractions. Although you are sometimes caught in the traps of an over sensitive emotionalism, feelings remain your best assets in many circumstances. There is another aspect to the Venusian dominant. According to the Tradition, this planet rules the Arts, and you are endowed with some degree of artistic dispositions, ranging from good to excellent.\nInterpretation of the 13ï¿½ Pisces symbolic degree\n\"A man chops wood in a glade. Near the logs neatly arranged in piles, children do a circle dance.\" ( Janduz version)\nHonest, benevolent, and persevering character. After years of hard work, one achieves success and wealth in the wood or construction industry, in agriculture or horticulture. All occupations related to urbanism, especially the design of new cities, or the rebuilding of places destroyed by war or natural disasters, are also very favoured. Even after having reached the pinnacle of one's career, one remains simple and accessible, which commands people's respect.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

For a woman, Mars corresponds to the kind of man she's attracted to (but not especially in marriage which is rather symbolized by the Sun, Mars is the lover, not the husband). Fire is its element, it is hot and dry, and it rules Aries and Scorpio (along with Pluto), is in exaltation with Capricorn and is in analogy with the muscles and the spleen.\nIt represents the soldiers, sportsmen, warriors, surgeons, blacksmiths... ; the age of Mars goes from 42 to 50 years old.\nTemperament : Bilious\nCharacterology : Emotive, Active, Primary type. It is a Choleric.\nMars in Virgo\nThe planet Mars indicates how you react to life concrete stimulations. It also describes your fighting spirit, your abilities to stand for yourself and to take action. With Mars in Virgo, you strive to control your emotions and to reduce your field of activity in order to keep a maximal level of efficiency in your actions. When you commit yourself into something, you display a strong ingenuity and resourcefulness and you intervene at the right time. Your actions are as efficient as they are discreet. You may not feel comfortable when the situation you face is not logical. The whims of fate are not your allies: but you analyze properly more stable situations and you handle them methodically well. You seldom take inconsiderate actions and you prefer to take the time to weigh up the pros and the cons before undertaking anything. Your entourage may see your reserve and your restraint as a lack of boldness.\nMars in House IV\nWith Mars in the 4th House, life is a duel between your private world and social structures, as well as between your family roots and the external world's imperatives. You put your fighting spirit at the service of the defence of your clan. Family and homeland: here are your reasons to take action as well as to fight for your rights and your interests. You do not let anybody endanger your cell, your little world, and your close friends. Should these values be threatened, you immediately mobilise all your resources in order to protect them.\nMars Dominant\nIf Mars is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Marsian: in your hand-to-hand struggle for life, you demonstrate an acute and active sense of confrontation with the world, with other people, and with your own destiny. You need to take action and to fight for your projects and your desires. You perceive all situations with deep intensity, and you react to the here and now without bothering to step back in order to ensure that events are under your control. You take up challenges with excessive foolhardiness as a consequence of your impulsiveness. However, better than anyone else, you know how to mobilise your resources in case of crisis. You take action whenever it is necessary to do so, and you are present in a timely manner. With Mars, your attitudes are dictated by the realities of the moment, by your emotions, and by everything which proved to have worked in the past. When this dominant is not well integrated, it may bring about an aggressive or impulsive behaviour. Therefore, you must learn to control your hyper-sensitivity and your fits of temper. You are also endowed with Marsian qualities: the fighting spirit and the taste for duel without which one may find oneself overwhelmed by events. When this willpower is well channelled, its precious energy enables to cope with all sorts of contingencies. There are a thousand ways to win, and a thousand challenges to take up with the enthusiasm and the dynamism which make life so worthy. A certain idea of life which is wild, passionate, and in tune with events.\nInterpretation of the 6ï¿½  Virgo symbolic degree\n\"A poor woman steps aside as an arrogant and lavishly dressed lady walks towards a couple who is standing back-to-back.\" ( Janduz version)\nHumble, generous, and passive character which, although not unsociable, behaves gawkily when dealing with other people, particularly with persons of the opposite gender.

Actually the humid version of Mars, inclined to action like him.\nJupiter in Virgo\nThe planet Jupiter symbolizes expansion, broadness and generosity. Jupiter is associated with the functions of synthesis, enthusiasm and optimism. In your natal chart, his house position is more important than his sign position because, like Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Jupiter in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows.   Jupiter in Virgo gives you a talent for work, for practical activities and a higher than average dexterity. You have a strong sense of duty. You are very appreciated in your work environment because you are a perfectionist. The Tradition underlines that all the fields related to health and physical wellbeing are favoured.\nJupiter in House IV\nWith Jupiter in the 4th House, the world is a big family! You get easily integrated within the most diverse social structures, and you know how to establish a climate of confidence and intimacy even though you are not familiar with the situation. Life is made of encounters and integrations. Sometimes, in order that the other person becomes an integral part of your personal world, and that you feel you both belong to the same clan, all you need to do is to get to understand the other one, and to find a common language.\nJupiter Dominant\nIf Jupiter is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Jupiterian: because this planet brings about a keen interest in social and professional success, the Tradition considers it to be beneficial. Indeed, you know how to adjust to events and to jump at the chance when it arises. The members of you entourage gladly entrust you with high responsibilities because they are often impressed by your learning skills and your adaptation abilities as you deal with new structures and new languages. What is the secret of your good star? It is your self-confidence which wins public support. Now, what is the secret of your charm? Definitely, enthusiasm, euphoria, and exaltation. Exaggeration also. When this dominant is well integrated, it is a factor of affluence and optimism, and a certain degree of joviality enables you to easily fit into various spheres. It constitutes your main asset to manage your life. However, you must at times curb your desire for integration, lest your sense of opportunity turns into extreme opportunism. Here also, the key to success lies in a correct estimate of everyone's chances and possibilities. Although management is one of your forte, and you can adjust your objectives to current realities better than other people, you lack the hindsight which enables  you to avoid short-term vagaries and daily fluctuations. If you strive too much to adapt, you run a risk of betraying yourself. This is the other traditional side of the coin with \"The Greater Benefic\"!\nInterpretation of the 17ï¿½  Virgo symbolic degree\n\"An old man happily watches children play cheerfully under a beautiful tree.\" ( Janduz version)\nLenient, generous, and sensitive character. One protects and devotes oneself to the family members, but one also cares for other people's needs. In some cases, one suffers the loss of a child. One's major goal is to found and run a centre dedicated to children and youths in distress, even though financial resources are not sufficient, or despite the disapproval expressed by the spouse or the other family members. Success can be achieved in the civil service, in an administrative position in the military or in the police. This degree heralds longevity and happiness, in spite of the fact that one is not really understood by the entourage. If in the natal chart, Venus is in Taurus and forms a trine with this degree, it indicates talents for artwork, especially painting and pottery.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Saturn eliminates anything that is not authentic, sooner or later. It is impossible to cheat him as he gives an irresistible desire to form a coherent whole with oneself, in responsible and wise ways. He is the great purifier. He represents our limitations but also our truth. In your natal chart, the house position where Saturn is posited is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Saturn in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows.   Saturn in Aquarius endows you with the capacity to deliver in collective areas, humanitarian causes or avant-gardist projects. Your sensitivity is withdrawn but it is offset by your ability to handle human relationships in a daring and efficient way, which allows you to achieve your goals for the sake of a cause.\nSaturn in House IX\nIn your natal chart, Saturn is in the 9th House. Between conservative rigour and intolerance, as well as between seriousness and austerity, the line is very thin. You must not cross it. Then, your honesty can work wonders. Firstly, owing to your intellectual honesty, you do not fake your knowledge, and you do not compromise with truth. Secondly, owing to your moral integrity, you feel that it is essential that your relationships be transparent, sometimes at the cost of a few sacrifices. In such a context, how is it possible to criticise you for any lack of flexibility?\nSaturn Dominant\nIf Saturn is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Saturnian: you gladly leave to other people the decision to take life as it comes. As far as you are concerned, you prefer to take advantage of your experiences in order to discover, to grow, and to question yourself.\nInterpretation of the 12ï¿½ Aquarius symbolic degree\n\"An infuriated lion struggles against the bars of its cage.\" ( Janduz version)\nAmbitious, independent, and fiery character. It is indispensable to give up vengeful projects and to ensure that one's authority is not misused, lest all kinds of disastrous events and setbacks crop up. In a figurative sense, this degree indicates that one may be kept in prison by one's rebellious and anarchistic tendencies.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Uranus triggers the irresistible need for freedom that we have in ourselves. Uranus tends to break the constraints that have become unbearable and gives us the courage and the will to get rid of what has become a burden; when he is well aspected, he also indicates genius. In your natal chart, Uranusï¿½ house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Uranus in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows.   The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendantï¿½s ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Uranus in Aries increases your dynamism and your charisma but he may give you a self-centered nature through excessive drive and confidence.\nUranus in House XI\nWith Uranus in the 11th House, you are interested in projects of society. But the individual has the first place! You need to protect everyone's freedom, and to build a fraternal world. Your conceptions are liberal, often original, and personal. You never compromise over certain principles. Your friendships are straightforward, devoid of hidden agenda or ambiguity. You link up with other people because you want to share an ideal and assert the values you have in common. Without these objectives, you cannot develop a genuine relationship.\nUranus Dominant\nIf Uranus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Uranian: personal values are prevailing. Inner certainties fuel an inflexible will and a desire to call attention on yourself as well as to follow your beliefs through. This planet prompts you to behave with determination, to put forward your own truth, and to start your personal revolution. More than other people, you are willing to keep some degree of autonomy in all circumstances, and you often display an individualistic nature. In order to achieve your ideal of freedom and independence, you may act like a despot as you try to convince and to impose your views, whether smoothly or forcefully. Regardless of the flexibility of your comportment, some situations demand an absolute firmness as well as uncompromising, frank and straightforward attitudes. People may criticise you for your intransigence and say that you are a hardliner. Outsider's opinions don't matter! The most important thing is that you act in all conscience and reach your primary objectives. More than anyone else, you know how to use your willpower and to focus your energy on a precise aim, relentlessly, whatever the consequences might be. In the chapter of qualities, let's mention a definite sense of responsibility, an innovative mind open to techniques and modern ideas, as well as a natural self-discipline which overcomes many an obstacle. Therefore, people are well-advised not to hound you into a corner.\nInterpretation of the 21ï¿½ Aries symbolic degree\n\"A man, who just filled his jug at the fountain, walks so carelessly that the water spills on the ground. A bear bites a tree trunk.\" ( Janduz version)\nLazy, carefree and conceited character. One loses one's credibility and wealth owing to one's indecisiveness and wrong judgements. Furthermore, one nurtures ambitions which are out of proportion with one's intellectual and financial abilities. The bear indicates that one keeps other people responsible for one's failures instead of acknowledging that one's negligence and lack of skills are the real causes of repeated setbacks.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Water is its element, it is moist, it rules Pisces, is in exaltation in Cancer, though some authors say it is Leo, and is in analogy with the vegetative system.\nIt represents dreamers, mediums, magicians, merchants of illusion, drug addicts.\nTemperament : rather Lymphatic\nCharacterology : Emotive, non Active, Primary or Secondary type; it is a Sentimental, or sometimes Amorphous type.\nNeptune in Virgo\nThe planet Neptune symbolizes extreme receptivity, intense emotional sharpness, impressionability and inspiration; it is the planet of mediums, mystics and religious faith. In an astrological chart, it indicates dilution, vagueness, understanding oneï¿½s environment through emotions and the absence of clear and determined limits and structures. In your natal chart, Neptuneï¿½s house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Neptune in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows.   The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendantï¿½s ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Neptune in Virgo inclines you to be doubtful because your emotions bring about questions to which your logic cannot answer. Logic and intuition must become complementary and to that end, you must step back, as required.\nNeptune in House IV\nWith Neptune in the 4th House, the family cell is your source for inspiration, and the goldmine from which you draw your intuitions and your dearest motivations. You are impressionable. You tend to let your close friends guide you, and you rely on the comfortable assistance of your clan. Your acute sense of psychology enables you to take advantage of atmospheres, and to effortlessly seize the opportunities offered by your family circle.\nNeptune Dominant\nIf Neptune is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Neptunian: your intuition is highly developed. You are of a contemplative nature, and you are particularly receptive to ambiances, places, and people. You gladly cultivate the art of letting-go, and you allow the natural unfolding of events to construct your world. You follow your inspirations, for better or for worse. At times, you display an extraordinary clairvoyance gift. You seem to be able to read your subconscious like a book, and you track down subtle underlying mechanisms, flaws, or open breaches. This innate intuition might explain the strokes of good luck which the Neptunian is sometimes credited with. However, you may also be the victim of illusions and misleading intuitions. You are an idealist, and you let your deepest aspirations prevail over the realities of the moment. Then, you set off in quest of some quixotic objective, living like a Don Quixote who relentlessly pursues an impossible dream. You have a great talent for psychology and the mysteries of the human soul. Since you instinctively perceive people's intents and motivations, as you swim in the complexity of human nature, you feel in your element. The subtlety of your perceptiveness is the source of both special affections and irrevocable rejections. What is the danger of such a dominant? If it is not offset by other influences in your natal chart, you may not have an iron will. Your trump card is your instinct, which may be developed to the extent that it becomes clairvoyance.\nInterpretation of the 8ï¿½  Virgo symbolic degree\n\"A man and a woman wearing a mask stand at both ends of a table on which there are bags of money and beautiful fruits. The woman protects the money with her hand while the man grasps a fruit.\" ( Janduz version)\nSociable and generous character lacking willpower. It seems that money falls on one's laps, whether it comes through inheritance or through work. However, one does not know how to deal with it, and it becomes a source of troubles because of a female's machinations. One is driven by greed and passions and may fall prey of dishonest people.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Its element is indefinite; burning (like lava in fusion ?), it rules Scorpio, is in exaltation in Pisces and is in analogy with the sexual organs and excretion.\nIt represents dictators, sadistic people, violent characters, is instinctive and powerful but also mysterious with hidden strengths.\nTemperament : rather Bilious\nCharacterology : Emotive or non-Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is a Passionate Choleri typec.\nPluto in Cancer\nThe planet Pluto symbolizes deep disruptions and upheavals, domination and sexual instincts, and the inner power we have in ourselves. Pluto destroys in order to reconstruct and he provokes painful crises that are needed in metamorphosis. Pluto is our deepest instinctsï¿½ brutal force. It is the hidden and unconscious violence that can explode in us with incredible intensity before being projected in our actions; in itself, the planet is not negative: the might and the intensity of its energy are beyond the conceivable but it can be funnelled. Pluto is the only possibility we have at our disposal to overcome our inner blocks and to eliminate outgrown situations that have become inextricable. Plutoï¿½s energy is valuable because of its usefulness for the irreversible destruction of what constitutes a problem and not because of its negative side and its perversity. Pluto allows to reconstruct and to regenerate parts of our personality or whole stretches of our life, provided that we manage to funnel his wild energy and to step back. It is impossible to tame this energy, given its essence. However, it is possible to take advantage of it for a precise aim, through a temporary identification of some parts of us with this energy. In such a case, the outcome is our final evolution and even, our transformation. In your natal chart, Plutoï¿½s house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, Pluto is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Pluto in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows.   The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality and they are not to be really taken into account, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendantï¿½s ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Pluto in Cancer may create troubles in your home because your will to control is too strong or because you are exceedingly sensitive.\nPluto in House II\nWith Pluto in the 2nd House, what are your most precious possessions? It's a secret! In any case, you are not quite sure to know what is really valuable. Your capital is hidden. You do not flaunt your money, if you have any, and you do not reveal your dearest feelings. You are not interested in possessing, which does not prevent you from working behind the scenes in order to make your assets yield profit. Some day, you may be rich. However, you will always look poor.\nPluto Dominant\nIf Pluto is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Plutonian: you sometimes feel like a foreigner who does not belong to the world, to its laws, and its concerns. The rules of life in society are not necessarily yours. You are interested in what is unknown and in the subtle laws of a hidden order. So, you take malicious pleasure in ridiculing the patterns you find too simplistic or too rigid. You also revel in underlining the limits of explanations you deem too common. There is something unconventional about the way you are, the way you think, and the way you act. What is your specificity made of? Is it an extraordinary partner? A life off the beaten path? Or do you only distance yourself from conventional morals? In any case, you have the feeling, sometimes quite vague, that you come from nowhere, and that you do not belong to any definite group... In short, it means that you cannot be simplified in order to conform to existing models. The gap between you and ordinary mortals is also an element of your strength. Your deep clear-sightedness, firstly, enables you to put things into perspective and to grant them only the attention they deserve. Your other remarkable asset is your capacity to intervene from behind the scenes, to secretly organise events, and to bring about the desirable outcome without seeming to impose or to dictate anything. However, you must still overcome one of the major difficulties of this dominant, which is to get people to accept your difference and to smoothly fit into your environment.\nInterpretation of the 21ï¿½  Cancer symbolic degree\n\"A man stands on top of a mountain with a commanding staff in his hand, his face ablaze with the setting sun.\" ( Janduz version)\nAmbitious, enduring, and radiant character. Owing to one's exceptional intelligence and physical strength, one can accomplish sporting feats. One is attracted to adventures and interested in the natural laws which rule such topics as waves or astronomy. At the height of one's career, when one least expects it, one may be toppled from one's position. Despite numerous ordeals, one always gets out of bad situations thanks to one's own merits, and one achieves success, fame, honours, and wealth. Mid-life is a period when one may experience sudden threats through water such as floods or drowning. Therefore, one must avoid foolhardiness. Old age is happy.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Most astrologers consider it as a kind of \"mediator\" between Saturn and outer planets. Consequently, Chiron is of Saturn's nature and at the same time is influenced by Uranus, the first slow-moving planet. Astrologically, it symbolizes wisdom, patience and the faculty to reduce others' sufferings: it is said to be the \"great healer\" of the zodiac. Like all the secondary bodies, it must be in close conjunction with planets or angles in order to fully express its action.\n%TEXTES_22%\n%DYNAMIQUE_23%\nAsteroids: Ceres\nCeres, the biggest of the four minor asteroids used besides Chiron, is associated with the mythological goddess of growing plants and harvest and also symbolizes physical constitution, vitality and fertility. She's also known as Demeter, according to the astrologer Zipporah Dobyns, linked to the symbolism of the mother but in a less emotive and more physical way than the Moon. Ceres is thought to be the ruler of Virgo, in exaltation in Gemini, in exile in Pisces and in fall in Sagittarius. Keywords associated with Ceres could be order, practical sense, worry, precision, modesty, method, sobriety, motherhood, fertility, the Earth: a kind of a more cerebral Moon...\n%TEXTES_23%\n%DYNAMIQUE_24%\nAsteroids: Pallas\nPallas is sometimes used in modern Astrology: she represents intelligence, abstract and global thinking talents. It is usually considered to be a determining element in political strategy.\n%TEXTES_24%\n%DYNAMIQUE_25%\nAsteroids: Juno\nJuno is the asteroid corresponding to the adaptation to the marital partner and to the defence of individual rights; it is thus used in the field of marriage.\n%TEXTES_25%\nVesta is rarely used and brings the ability to efficiently devote oneself to a cause.\n%TEXTES_26%\nTrue North Node 7ï¿½44' Я Pisces, in House X\nNorth Node\nThe North Node (True Node here) represents the goals that must be achieved during life, in the karmic sense according to some traditions. Its position in house indicates in what field an effort is necessary in order to evolve. The North Node is often called the Dragon's head, it is usually considered beneficial, a bit like Jupiter with the planets. The Lunar nodes are fictional points and not actual heavenly bodies: they are the intersections of the Moon with the Ecliptic (the path made by the Sun in its orbit as seen from the Earth). The axis of the Lunar nodes moves 19 degrees each year, namely a bit more than three minutes each day.\nThe South Node is diametrically opposed to the North Node, therefore it faces it (it's not drawn here, it's the same symbol but upside down). It symbolizes what has already been achieved or acquired, in a karmic sense: it's the past from which it's advised to move on in order to progress. The South Node is rather negative, of a Saturnian nature: the experience through suffering.\nInterpretation of the 7ï¿½  Pisces symbolic degree\n\"A man and a woman on their horses progress at a quiet pace, side by side. Behind them are two concentric circles.\" ( Janduz version)\nObliging, passive, and gentle character endowed with magnetism or gifts for occultism. The decision-making process requires quite some time, as if one revolved endlessly around the same centre, as suggested by the image. This degree promises long-lasting happiness in love and perhaps an early marriage. One prefers to enjoy the pleasures of life in one-to-one contexts, be it in the affective, friendly, or professional areas.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nTrue Lilith 13ï¿½17' Я Taurus, in House XII\nLilith\nLilith or the Dark Moon (True Lilith here) represents the uncrossable threshold, taboos, the individual's provocative and fascinating side, including on a sexual level. She symbolizes violence and \"untameability\", the radical and deep-seated refusal to submit. The keywords for Lilith can be sterility, sadism, perversity, castration, sadomasochism, eroticism, orgasm, forbidden fantasies, marginality, cruelty; redemption, illumination, rebelliousness... Lilith's opposite point is called Priapus; it is the Lunar perigee, the position where the Moon is closest to the Earth. It symbolizes man's primitive nature, the horror hidden in our deepest self; masochism, extreme sensuality, impulsiveness, irrationality and excess. Physically speaking, the Dark Moon is the focal point unoccupied by the Earth: it is not a concrete body but a mathematical point.\nInterpretation of the 13ï¿½  Taurus symbolic degree\n\"Measuring devices are tidily kept in a small carpenter shop. The door is wide open, but a strong man blocks the way with a long rod he holds across the entrance.\" ( Janduz version)\nHumble, accommodating, and hardworking character. One appreciates well-done work and dedicates one's life to other people. Endeavours aiming at defending the cause of justice and fraternity are fully rewarded. The man with the rod symbolises a protection against hatred and negative forces. This degree endows with great moral authority and, at a higher level, gifts for occultism.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nFortune 27ï¿½10' Capricorn, in House VIII\nPart of Fortune\nThe Part of Fortune is an ancient concept, used by Ptolemy and other astrologers before him. Firstly, it has nothing to do with fortune! In modern astrology, it is actually used to enhance a planet or angle when in close conjunction with it: it thus amplifies the meaning associated to the point affected by its presence. It is calculated in the following way:\nPart of Fortune = AS + Moon - Sun (it is the Moons position when the Sun rises)\nThe classical Part of Fortune, of which the calculus method is unchanged whether in a diurnal or nocturnal chart, is usually distinguished from the diurnal/nocturnal  Part of Fortune which is calculated by the formula AS + Sun - Moon for a nocturnal chart, and AS + Moon - Sun in a diurnal chart.\nWe currently use the latter formula for our astrological programmes.\nInterpretation of the 27ï¿½ Capricorn symbolic degree\n\"A man with a shining globe above his head holds a sextant in one hand and a pair of compasses in the other.\" ( Janduz version)\nPrecise, brilliant, and passionate character endowed with a vivid imagination and sharp analytical skills. Owing to one's personal qualities and exacting work, one achieves remarkable success and fame in science or in all occupations involving fire, ice, or furs. This degree heralds good luck.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nAscendant  26ï¿½44' Gemini\nAscendant or House I\nThe First House or Ascendant represents one's behaviour in the eyes of others, and also one's health. It corresponds to the way the individual acts in the world. It is the image of the personality seen by others and the person's visible behaviour expressed outwardly. The 1st House is in analogy with Aries and thus Mars too, and then the Sun. It is an angular house, the most important one with the Midheaven, maybe even more so due to its link with the body and health.\nAscendant in Gemini\nYour mobility is such that you are in every place where you are not expected. You spend lots of time asking questions andï¿½ answering them. Your curiosity and your quick-wittedness are insatiable. Your mind is in constant turmoil, hopping from one topic to another, solving problems, accumulating anecdotes and knowledge within a short range of time. Your mobility is mostly mental, it takes you afar and turns your daily life into a mosaic of intense and pleasant moments that are not necessarily related to each other: provided things are moving, your neurons are kept busy and you can meet with people, everything is fine!\nWith this Ascendant, you come across as nervous, expressive, lively, adaptable, with a good sense of humour, bubbling, playful, sociable, clever, whimsical, independent, intellectual, flexible, ingenious, fanciful, imaginative, charming, cerebral, and you are into everything. You may also be capricious, unfocused, quirky, superficial, indiscreet, opportunist, unmindful, selfish, sarcastic or mercurial.\nInterpretation of the 26ï¿½ Gemini symbolic degree\n\"By the seaside, a man and a woman weep, seated on rocks.\" ( Janduz version)\nRomantic, melancholic, and trusting character prone to become affectively dependent. In a male chart, there is a lack of manliness, and therefore, the necessity to assert oneself more strongly. In a female chart, after a disappointing marriage, one develops a deep contempt and mistrust for men and turns down any proposal for fear of being hurt again. For both genders, this degree describes a mismatched couple. Marriage ends in divorce or widowhood.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nMidheaven  21ï¿½41' Aquarius\nMidheaven or House X\nThe Tenth House still called the Midheaven, is the highest point amidst the houses, at the top of the chart, in the South, and relates to destiny in general and career (and not daily work as meant by the Sixth House). The Midheaven represents our achievements and goals in the social sphere, our social position in society, and becomes more and more important as we get older. It is in analogy with Capricorn and Saturn. The Tenth House is the most important angular house along with the Ascendant.\nMidheaven in Aquarius\nYour destiny is commensurate with your unpredictable nature. Your life is full of changes in direction which are caused by your sudden surges of independence and freedom. They enable you to evade monotony and recreate different environments in which you feel good again.\nThe following professions are most likely to suit you very well: pilot, IT expert, electronics or network engineer, astronaut, astronomer, astrologer, occultism specialist, neurosurgeon, atomist researcher, scientist, electrician, webmaster, stunt pilot, photographer, film-maker, humorist, humanitarian activist, NGO manager, and philosopher.\nInterpretation of the 21ï¿½ Aquarius symbolic degree\n\"A furious bull tramples on a dog. A man examines a corpse.\" ( Janduz version)\nViolent, excessive, and spiteful character. If one is able to control one's outbursts of fury, success can be attained in the military and in all occupations requiring physical strength, or in surgery and medical research. This degree warns against vengeful deeds because extreme brutality can only result in equally extreme disasters.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nAscendant 26ï¿½44' Gemini\nHouse I (AC)\nThe First House or Ascendant represents one's behaviour in the eyes of others and also one's health. It corresponds to the way the individual acts in the world.  It is the image of the personality as seen by others and the person's visible behaviour expressed outwardly. The 1st House is in analogy with Aries and thus Mars too and then the Sun. It is an angular house, the most important one with the Midheaven, maybe even more so due to its link with the body and health; the Ascendant is as important as the Sun in a natal chart.\nInterpretation of the 26ï¿½ Gemini symbolic degree\n\"By the seaside, a man and a woman weep, seated on rocks.\" ( Janduz version)\nRomantic, melancholic, and trusting character prone to become affectively dependent. In a male chart, there is a lack of manliness, and therefore, the necessity to assert oneself more strongly. In a female chart, after a disappointing marriage, one develops a deep contempt and mistrust for men and turns down any proposal for fear of being hurt again.

This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nHouse II 13ï¿½42' Cancer\nHouse II\nThe Second House is the sphere of material security, the money we earn, our possessions, also in a symbolic meaning (close people etc). It is in analogy with Taurus and Venus. It is a succedent house, quite important.\nHouse III 0ï¿½46' Leo\nHouse III\nThe Third House is the sphere of social and intellectual apprenticeship, studies, relationships with close people and surroundings, short trips, light-hearted and quick contacts, correspondences. It is in analogy with Gemini and Mercury. It's a cadent house, less important than the angular and succedent ones.\nHouse IV 21ï¿½41' Leo\nHouse IV (IC)\nThe Fourth House also called Immum Coeli is the sphere of inner emotions, family, the father, home and roots, but also the home one creates. It's Home Sweet Home, security and cocoon. It is in analogy with Cancer and the Moon. It's an angular and important house.\nInterpretation of the 21ï¿½ Leo symbolic degree\n\"A sparrow hawk glides above a nest of fledglings.  In the nearby thatched cottage, an ailing man lies in bed.\" ( Janduz version)\nNaive, indecisive, and weak character. Dangers and deceits crop up since childhood. They come from outsiders but also from the family circle. One tends to seek help from the very people who are envious and willing to harm. It is strongly recommended not to trust anyone, and never to talk about one's successes, even with family members, because some relatives covet the assets of the person born under the influence of this degree. Should the natal chart concur, a sudden disease such as meningitis may affect the head.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nHouse V 22ï¿½07' Virgo\nHouse V\nThe Fifth House is the sphere of pleasures and love affairs (but not commitment or marriage), creations and entertainments, children, arts and game. It is in analogy with Leo and the Sun. It's a succedent and quite important house.\nHouse VI 8ï¿½50' Scorpio\nHouse VI\nThe Sixth House is the sphere of apprenticeship and effort in the work environment, daily life, health on a daily basis and not operations or long-term diseases, relationships with co-workers or subordinates, desire for improvement, analysis and detail. It is in analogy with Virgo and Mercury. It is a cadent house, less important than the angular and succedent ones.\nHouse VII 26ï¿½44' Sagittarius\nHouse VII (DS)\nThe Seventh House also called the Descendant (in front of the Ascendant) is the sphere of partnership, marriage, contracts, relationships with others, the outer world. It is in analogy with Libra and Venus, and Saturn to a lesser extent. It is an angular and important house.\nInterpretation of the 26ï¿½ Sagittarius symbolic degree\n\"A lion tries to catch a man hanged to a tree by the feet.\" ( Janduz version)\nCourageous, enterprising, and honest character. One may be the victim of unfair, less scrupulous or less skilled superiors. Despite numerous enemies, one reaches a prominent position. Nevertheless, one must remain very careful, adopt a low profile, and be prepared to thwart the machinations concocted by higher-ups.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nHouse VIII 13ï¿½42' Capricorn\nHouse VIII\nThe Eighth House is the sphere of emotional security, the depths of the self, secrets and paranormal, transcendence, sexuality, mysteries, upheavals, surgical operations, others' money (investments, inheritances), crises, transformation after evolution, death. It is in analogy with Scorpio and Pluto, and Mars to a lesser extent. It is a succedent and quite important house.\nHouse IX 0ï¿½46' Aquarius\nHouse IX\nThe Ninth House is the sphere of high studies, both physical and mental journeys (philosophy, spirituality), rebelliousness, changes of scenery, desire for dealing with the unknown. It is in analogy with Sagittarius and Jupiter. It is a cadent house, less important than the angular and succedent ones.\nMidheaven 21ï¿½41' Aquarius\nHouse X (MC)\nThe Tenth House still called the Midheaven, is the highest point amidst the houses, at the top of the chart, in the South, and relates to destiny in general and career (and not daily work as meant by the Sixth House). The Midheaven represents our achievements and goals in the social sphere, our social position in society, and becomes more and more important as we get older. It is in analogy with Capricorn and Saturn. The Tenth House is the most important angular house along with the Ascendant.\nInterpretation of the 21ï¿½ Aquarius symbolic degree\n\"A furious bull tramples on a dog. A man examines a corpse.\" ( Janduz version)\nViolent, excessive, and spiteful character. If one is able to control one's outbursts of fury, success can be attained in the military and in all occupations requiring physical strength, or in surgery and medical research.

It is in analogy with Aquarius and Uranus, and Saturn to a lesser extent. It's a succedent and quite important house.\nHouse XII 8ï¿½50' Taurus\nHouse XII\nThe Twelfth House is the sphere of hidden things, enemies, closed or remote places (hospital, prison, convent etc.), ordeals, secrecy, solitude, long-term illnesses but also sincere devotion and genuine compassion. It is in analogy with Pisces and Neptune.\nVertex 13ï¿½16' Scorpio, in House VI\nThe Vertex\nThe Vertex, sometimes called counter-Ascendant, is a fictitious point which is at the intersection of two great circles, the Ecliptic and the great vertical circle (Prime Vertical) in the West of the birthplace, linking the East, the Zenith, the West, and the Nadir. It is always located in the West of the chart around the Descendant. It is the chart's fifth angle, so to speak, less important than the other angles. Its interpretation is controversial, because certain astrologers pay no attention to it.\nThe Vertex is sometimes considered to be the second Descendant because, like the latter, it is related to communication and exchanges. It has to do with associations and fated encounters, those that are not chosen, and reveals the type of sensitivity and reactivity we have in our dealings with other people: a refined and tolerant way in Libra, straightforward and spontaneous in Aries, etc.\nInterpretation of the 13ï¿½ Scorpio symbolic degree\n\"Under a flowery arbour, a group of cheerful guests have a feast. Water overflows from a well adorned with beautiful roses.\" ( Janduz version)\nJovial, sincere, and generous character. One confides in anyone, including in persons who are not trustworthy. Owing to one's excessive and undiscerning generosity, one is easily taken advantage of by greedy people, and thus, one endangers one's wealth. If in the natal chart, the Sun is in conjunction with this degree, it indicates frail health.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\nEast Point 26ï¿½22' Taurus, in House XII\nThe East Point\nThe East Point is a fictitious point at the intersection of two great circles, the Ecliptic and the great vertical circle (Prime Vertical) in the East of the birthplace, linking the East, the Zenith, the West, and the Nadir. It is always located in the East of the chart, around the Ascendant.\nThe East Point is sometimes considered to be a second Ascendant, less important, but also related to how one is seen by other people, and to how one expresses one's personality.\nInterpretation of the 26ï¿½ Taurus symbolic degree\n\"An alchemist works in his laboratory. A heap of gold coins are on his table. The window overlooks a field covered with wheat.\" ( Janduz version)\nIngenious, simple and noble character. Success and wealth are achieved in an unusual profession or in activities dealing with metal. It is most likely that a major discovery or invention is rewarded by a prestigious prize. Even though one earns a lot of money, one does not change one's frugal lifestyle.\nN.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n%DYNAMIQUE_46%\nCupido\nCupido is a hypothetical trans-Neptunian planet, the existence of which is not proven.

David died in 1992.\nFriendship with Terence Stamp\nIn the 1960s, Terence Stamp shared a flat with Caine before and during their rise to fame (Stamp became famous first after his Oscar-nominated role in Billy Budd).

This was a couple of hours before Caine's thirtieth birthday, which was a deadline Caine had set himself to \"make it\" or quit acting. Also, Caine tried to force Stamp to reverse his decision to turn down the role of Alfie; a star role that Caine later accepted. In his later autobiography, What's it All About, Caine states that he still wakes up sweating in the night as he sees Terence agreeing to \"accept my advice\". The friendship eventually dwindled at the tail-end of the '60s, and this is described in contrast by Stamp and Caine in their respective autobiographies.\nAwards and Nominations\n1966 - Nominated - Best Actor in a Leading Role - Alfie\n1972 - Nominated - Best Actor in a Leading Role - Sleuth\n1983 - Nominated - Best Actor in a Leading Role - Educating Rita\n1986 - Won - Best Actor in a Supporting Role - Hannah and Her Sisters\n1999 - Won - Best Actor in a Supporting Role - The Cider House Rules\n2002 - Nominated - Best Actor in a Leading Role - The Quiet American\nOther Notable Awards\nNew York Film Critics' Best Actor Award for Alfie\nBAFTA for Best Actor for Educating Rita\nGolden Globe for Best Actor for Educating Rita\nGolden Globe for Best Actor for Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\nGolden Globe for Best Actor for Jack the Ripper\nGolden Globe for Best Actor for Little Voice\n\n"
