First Modern Credit Card Introduced - About.com Education The History of the Credit Card\nThe first credit card.  Courtesy of Diners Club.\nUpdated October 19, 2015.\nCharging for products and services has become a way of life. No longer do people bring cash when they buy a sweater or a large appliance, they charge it. Some people do it for the convenience of not carrying cash; others \"put it on plastic\" so they can purchase an item they can not yet afford. The credit card that allows them to do this is a twentieth century invention.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, people had to pay cash for almost all products and services.\nAlthough the early part of the century saw an increase in individual store credit accounts, a credit card that could be used at more than one merchant was not invented until 1950. It all started when Frank X. McNamara and two of his friends went out to supper.\nThe Famous Supper\nIn 1949, Frank X McNamara, head of the Hamilton Credit Corporation, went out to eat with Alfred Bloomingdale, McNamara's long-time friend and grandson of the founder of the Bloomingdale's store, and Ralph Sneider, McNamara's attorney.\ncontinue reading below our video\n4 Tips for Improving Test Performance\nThe three men were eating at Major's Cabin Grill, a famous New York restaurant located next to the Empire State Building , to discuss a problem customer of the Hamilton Credit Corporation.\nThe problem was that one of McNamara's customers had borrowed some money but was unable to pay it back. This particular customer had gotten into trouble, when he had lent a number of his charge cards (available from individual department stores and gas stations) to his poor neighbors who needed items in an emergency. For this service, the man required his neighbors to pay him back the cost of the original purchase plus some extra money. Unfortunately for the man, many of his neighbors were unable to pay him back within a short period of time and he was then forced to borrow money from the Hamilton Credit Corporation.\nAt the end of the meal with his two friends, McNamara reached into his pocket for his wallet so that he could pay for the meal (in cash). He was shocked to discover that he had forgotten his wallet. To his embarrassment, he then had to call his wife and have her bring him some money. McNamara vowed never to let this happen again.\nMerging the two concepts from that dinner, the lending of credit cards and not having cash on hand to pay for the meal, McNamara came up with a new idea - a credit card that could be used at multiple locations. What was particularly novel about this concept was that there would be a middleman between companies and their customers.\nPrev\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nAre credit cards widely accepted at local establishments? ...

We do like to eat at local restaurants. Also we are renting a car for the week and plan doing many activities all around the island. Will I have trouble with my credit cards being accepted? I understand that at a roadside stand or when buying small goods at a store that does not get many tourists’ I will need cash, but as a general rule of thumb are credit cards widely accepted?\nThanks, Chuck\nTravelers interested in this topic also viewed...\nShow Prices\n1. Re: Are credit cards widely accepted at local establishments?\nApr 09, 2008, 1:14 PM\nNone of the beach bars on the east side accept credit cards. I'm not sure about the west side beach bars like CnC's or Mia.\nYou'll be able to rent a car with a credit card, but some places will want to charge 5-7% to use a credit card. In addition, some credit card companies are now charging a \"conversion fee\" of 1.5% So you'll pay a penalty for credit cards.\nMost of the major restaurants do accept credit cards: Prima, La Choza , Guidos, La Morena , etc. The smaller places do not. Look for the posted signs if they don't- nothing like washing dishes all night long.\nMost of the larger retail stores accept credit cards. Chedraui's accepts credit cards and they have English language ATM's.\nStill, your best bet is a couple of hundred in US cash and then pull money out of the ATM as you need it. I think $3000 pesos ($280 usd) cost me $3-4 dollars in fees so the cost was cheaper than my credit card company mark up.\nAlso- most USD are exchanged at 10:1 at bars and restuarants. It's not the best exchange rate you can get. The ATM is the best exchange rate followed by the cambios. Traveler's checks get a poor exchange rate at the cambios. Whatever you do, don't use the AMEX exchange in Customs. They have the worst exchange on the island.\nBe sure to call your credit card company before you leave the US so they know your purchases are legit. We were making a lot of electronic purchases one day when they thought our credit card had been stolen. They put a freeze on it. Fortunately, we had a second card to use while the first one was being unfrozen.\nReport inappropriate content\n2. Re: Are credit cards widely accepted at local establishments?\nApr 09, 2008, 1:30 PM\nOn the off chance that you use Bank of America, there is a bank there, Sandander (sp?), that is affiliated with them and you won't pay a fee at their ATM. We do business with Cozumel Sailing and they've told me that, while they'll take credit cards, they don't like to because of some kind of high surcharge that they have to pay. I don't remember exactly what the ATM fees are in Cozumel but I'm thinking they weren't any higher than the fees you pay here if you use an ATM not affiliated with your bank. We've just used credit cards for hotels and rental cars and use ATM's for everything else.\nOne attraction mentioned in this post\n3. Re: Are credit cards widely accepted at local establishments?\nApr 09, 2008, 2:07 PM\nI have been told that the businesses can be hit with up to 15% in merchant fees, so they will either add that into the transaction or be very reluctant to accept a card.\nA much bigger issue which I haven't seen any complaints about in quite a while but will caution you to be aware of is the prices shown on your credit card receipt. Prices in Coz should be in Pesos with about a 10 to 1 ratio. There have been a few messages here (a long time ago mind you) where after the bill was done the amount was billed back in US dollars at home. Make sure the receipt clearly says Pesos.\nReport inappropriate content\n\n"
