Sounds Of Silence - Lyrics Page Sounds Of Silence - Lyrics Page\nHello darkness, my old friend\nI've come to talk with you again\nBecause a vision softly creeping\nLeft its seeds while I was sleeping\nAnd the vision that was planted in my brain\nStill remains\nWithin the sound of silence\nIn restless dreams I walked alone\nNarrow streets of cobblestone\n'Neath the halo of a street lamp\nI turn my collar to the cold and damp\nWhen my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light\nThat split the night\nAnd touched the sound of silence\nAnd in the naked light I saw\nTen thousand people maybe more\nPeople talking without speaking\nPeople writing songs that voices never shared\nNo one dared\nDisturb the sound of silence\n\"Fools,\" said I, \"you do not know\nSilence like a cancer grows\nHear my words that I might teach you\nTake my arms that I might reach you\"\nBut my words like silent raindrops fell\nAnd echoed in the wells of silence\nAnd the people bowed and prayed\nTo the neon god they made\nAnd the sign flashed out its warning\nIn the words that it was forming\nAnd the sign said \"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls\nAnd tenement halls\nI was twenty-one years when I wrote this song\nI'm twenty-two now but I won't be for long\nTime hurries on\nAnd the leaves that are green turn to brown\nAnd they wither in the wind\nAnd they crumble in your hand\nOnce my heart was filled with the love of a girl\nI held her close but she faded in the night\nLike a poem I meant to write\nAnd the leaves that are green turn to brown\nAnd they wither in the wind\nAnd they crumble in your hand\nI threw a pebble in a brook\nAnd watched the ripple run away\nAnd they never made a sound\nAnd the leaves that are green turn to brown\nAnd they wither in the wind\nAnd they crumble in your hand\nHello, hello, hello, hello\nI can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love\nAs she lies here beside me, asleep with the night\nAnd her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow\nReflecting the glow of the winter moonlight\nBut I've got to creep down the alley way\nFly down the highway\nBefore they come to catch me I'll be gone\nSomewhere they can't find me\nOh baby, you don't know what I've done\nI've committed a crime, I've broken the law\nWhile you were here sleeping and just dreaming of me\nI held up and robbed a liquor store\nBut I've got to creep down the alley way\nFly down the highway\nBefore they come to catch me I'll be gone\nSomewhere they can't find me\nOh my life seems unreal, my crime an illusion\nA scene badly written in which I must play\nAnd though it puts me uptight to leave you\nI know it's not right to leave you\nThe morning is just a few hours away\nBut I've got to creep down the alley way\nFly down the highway\nThey say that Richard Cory owns one half of this whole town\nWith political connections to spread his wealth around\nBorn into society, a banker's only child\nHe had everything a man could want: power, grace, and style\nBut I work in his factory\nAnd I curse the life I'm living\nAnd I curse my poverty\nAnd I wish that I could be\nOh I wish that I could be\nOh I wish that I could be\nRichard Cory\nThe papers print his picture almost everywhere he goes\nRichard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at a show\nAnd the rumor of his parties and the orgies on his yacht!\nOh he surely must be happy with everything he's got\nBut I, I work in his factory\nAnd I curse the life I'm living\nAnd I curse my poverty\nAnd I wish that I could be\nOh I wish that I could be\nOh I wish that I could be\nRichard Cory\nHe freely gave to charity, he had the common touch\nAnd they were grateful for his patronage and they thanked him very much\nSo my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read:\n\"Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head\"\nBut I, I work in his factory\nAnd I curse the life I'm living\nAnd I curse my poverty\nAnd I wish that I could be\nOh I wish that I could be\nOh I wish that I could be\nRichard Cory\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nWhat did the sign say?

Is it about the assassination of JFK ? Or just trying to get some peace and quiet on the john (as in toilet, not Kennedy)?\nThe lyrics talk about a group of people making a \"neon god,\" a sign with a strange phrase on it.

Not \"Eat at Joe's,\" but \"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls […] and whispered in the sound of silence.\" \nVaguest sign ever.\nWhere you've heard it\nYou've heard this from crazy people in the subway or advertising executives who are really good at pretending not to be crazy folks on the subway.\nAdditional Notable References\nThis line is parodied in the song \"The Spirit of Radio\" by Rush.\nReferenced by Thomas L. Friedman in an article about a graffiti war in Beirut for the Times .\nThe opening line of this song, \"Hello, darkness, my old friend\" is part of a recurring gag on Arrested Development.  \nPretentious Factor\nIf you were to drop this quote at a dinner party, would you get an in-unison \"awww\" or would everyone roll their eyes and never invite you back? Here it is, on a scale of 1-10.\nIf \"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls […] and whispered in the sound of silence,\" we guess silence sounds like ads for Apple products and H&M…\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nThe Spirit Of Radio by Rush song ... \"For the words of the prophets were written on the subway walls, ... it's interesting you say that. \"The Spirit of Radio\" was ... The Spirit Of Radio by Rush - Song Meanings at Songfacts The Spirit Of Radio by Rush Songfacts\nThe Spirit Of Radio by Rush Songfacts\nSongfacts\nRush drummer and lyricist Neil Peart explained this song in an interview with Billboard magazine: \"The Spirit of Radio was actually written as a tribute to all that was good about radio, celebrating my appreciation of magical moments I'd had since childhood, of hearing 'the right song at the right time.' However, [the song's] celebration of the ideals of radio necessarily seemed like an attack on the reality - on the formulaic, mercenary programming of most radio stations, with music the last of anyone's concerns. And yes, it was really ironic that such a song became popular on radio, though it was a kind of litmus test. Some radio guys who 'got it' could hear the song and think, 'That's the way it ought to be,' while others - the shallow, swaggering salesmen-of-the-air - could be oblivious to the song's meaning and proudly applaud themselves, 'That's about me!'\" >>\nSuggestion credit:\nMike - Mountlake Terrace, Washington\nA key line in this song comes when Geddy Lee sings about concert halls that echo with \"the sound of salesmen.\" Neil Peart came up with the line after hearing stage patter from bands Rush would tour with; these bands would give the same spiel night after night, often telling the audience that their particular city was the greatest in the world or had the best fans. Peart found this disingenuous and manipulative.\nRush was never a band that pandered to their fans, and they were very careful when it came to marketing, as their ethos of free thought doesn't jibe with most promotional efforts that tell folks what to think. Peart cites Kiss as a \"salesmen\" group that markets the band as a lifestyle (you can even get buried in a Kiss Kasket when you die). Rush opened for Kiss on a series of shows in 1974. The bands got along very well, but it was clear they had very different ideas on how to present their product.\nThe unusual guitar sound heard in this song is achieved by Alex Lifeson playing on the neck of his instrument, and playing very quickly. >>\nSuggestion credit:\nJeff - Haltom City, TX\nThis was a rare hit single for Rush. Most of their songs at this stage of their career were meant to be heard within the context of an album, but this was short enough to get airplay and could stand on it's own as a single.\nIn the last verse, the line \"The words of the profits are written on the studio wall\" is a play on words. Rush drummer and lyricist Neil Peart wrote it as \"profits\" rather than \"prophets\" to expose the money-grubbing side of the music industry. The lyrics were included in the album and the CD.\nSimon and Garfunkel's \" The Sound Of Silence \" contains the lyrics: \"For the words of the prophets were written on the subway walls, and tenement halls... and echo with the sound of silence.\"\nThese are parodied by Neil Peart into, \"For the words of the prophets are written on the studio wall, and concert halls.... and echo with the sound... of salesmen.\" Rush has been accused of taking themselves too seriously, but references like this show how they were slyly aware of the context in which they performed. That they could take themselves lightly was further borne out by their 2008 appearance on The Colbert Report. >>\nSuggestion credit:\nTom - Chicago, IL\nThis song is heavily referenced on an episode of the cartoon Aqua Teen Hunger Force, where Master Shake, the actual Zakk Wylde , and a mock voice of Geddy Lee create a new version of the birthday song much to the liking of Rush's long, epic songs. One of the main characters, Meatwad, sings the main riff of this song on the way home, until seeing Geddy Lee's private jet (which is shaped like a bass guitar) and screams Geddy's line from this song \"OF SALESMEN!\" to try to get his attention. >>\nSuggestion credit:\nBert - Pueblo, NM\nPermanent Waves was released on January 1, 1980. This is the first track on the album, making it arguably the first song released in the '80s. >>\nSuggestion credit:\nJoe - Philadelphia, PA\nThe song is Rush's only entry on The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\nControversial talk show host Rush Limbaugh used this song during an attack against Georgetown student activist Sandra Fluke who demanded that contraception be provided by her Catholic university - something Obama's healthcare reform orders. Rush were unhappy about the use of their song during his rant, in which he called the girl \"slut,\" \"prostitute\" and \"round-heeled.\" Rush filed a cease and desist letter, asking the radio personality to stop playing their music on his show. Some other musicians, including Peter Gabriel, also demanded that Limbaugh stop using their music on his show.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nThe Spirit Of Radio Lyrics. ...

The drummer was often refered to as the salesman in the old days.. Like when salesmen drum up saes prospects.\nShawnS\n01/11/12,14:29\n0\nJohn's right. Prophets write words, even figuratively, not things like profits. It means those who only want to make profits on all this machinery are ubiquitous.\nLance\n10/01/11,07:07\n0\nThe beauty of the lyrics is that both words fit into the message - profit and prophet. Maybe Neil, genius that he is, wanted to leave it up to the listener to interpret it as they wish.\nJeff\n06/16/11,01:03\n0\nThe song is actually written as a tribute to a Toronto radio station - 102.1 CFNY. Its corporate run crap now but from '78-'02 it was a legit station that played only the best music of the time.\nJason\n04/11/11,20:06\n0\nIt is 'profits'. It is about radio (music), being alone, is beautiful, uplifting, and free. But the corporate world has tainted music with their 'glittering prizes...etc.' Hence '...salesmen...'\nmark\n04/02/11,21:53\n0\nIt is a prophet. A prophet spews words to write on a wall. Similar to a lyricist that believes they are a prophet.\nO'Dee\n02/26/11,17:48\n0\nI'm pretty sure from the context that it's prophets, that he's stating that the voices coming through the radio (musicians) are treated like modern day prophets!\nDani\n01/25/11,00:09\n0\nAnd the sign said, 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls, and whispered in the sounds of silence'. Simon and Garfunkel. Rock!\nTim\n01/14/11,17:54\n0\nRick is correct. It is not 'subway wall.'

Simon and Garfunkel - Sounds of Silence Lyrics | SongMeanings\nSimon and Garfunkel\nOldest First\n+1\nGeneral CommentThis has always been one of my favorite songs of their's, but thanks to Arrested Development it will always be stuck in my head.\n@jtk1993\n0\nMy InterpretationSimon&Garfunkel’s prophetic vision of a modern fragmented society of isolated people, alluding to Psalm 135:\nThe song’s narrator has received prophesy, in an essentially passive process: “Because a vision softly creeping / Left its seeds while I was sleeping / And the vision that was planted in my brain.” The narrator is like a prophet, a recipient of knowledge that he does not claim to have created.\nIn fact, the song expressly mentions prophets: “And the sign said, ‘The words of the prophets / Are written on the subway walls / And tenement halls.’ / And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.” In this modern society (of “neon lights” and “the neon god”), the words of prophets are overlooked and relegated to below-ground graffiti (“subway walls”) and destitute (“tenement halls”) – just as prophets were overlooked in past societies.\nThe prophecy is similar/allusive to Psalm 135:\nSong: \"People talking without speaking, / People hearing without listening\". Compare to Psalm 135: “They have mouths, but do not speak; they have eyes, but do not see; they have ears, but do not hear”. Not exactly the same words, but certainly similar ideas.\nSong: “And the people bowed and prayed / To the neon god they made.” Compare to Psalm 135: “The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands. . . . Those who make them become like them, so do all who trust in them.”\nYet the narrator is a prophet who can’t reach his audience: “’Fools’ said I, ‘You do not know / Silence like a cancer grows. / Hear my words that I might teach you, / Take my arms that I might reach you.’ / But my words like silent raindrops fell, / And echoed / In the wells of silence.”\nAnd so the song itself is a plea to break through the silence and finally reach is audience. Unable to otherwise reach them, he has crafted this melodic plea.… Does it work? That depends on us, the audience…. Is it possible that we hear and appreciate the words and melody, while missing the larger ideas? Or, in some cases, does this song help to actually break through the silence and resonate to convey its message? Either way, it’s a brilliant song….\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\n\"The Sound of Silence\" as written by Paul Simon. ...

Of course the message speaks (eerily) to all of us\nthe words I always remember\nTen thousand people maybe more\nPeople talking without speaking\nPeople hearing without listening\nPeople writing songs that voices never share\nthis could apply to totalitarian regime or just the totalitarian regime which is human complacence and mob mentality.\nHear my words that I might teach you\nTake my arms that I might reach you\"\nalways positive, I have no idea why this sticks with me but its beaten in my brain and still remains\nAnd the people bowed and prayed\nTo the neon god they made\nAnd the sign flashed out it's warning\nIn the words that it was forming\nAnd the sign said\n\"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls\"\nWhisper the sounds of silence\nI love this verse it is creepy to me (\"neon gods we made\" just hits to many chords like reading Farenheit 451 its to real in its imaginings) but the line about the propehts and the subway wall is just so RIGHT the true voices of a silent society are the vandals, the disenters, not that I advocate vandalism for its own sake I just really get this line.\nThis song is so chilling in its message, it makes me want to cry and hope for humanity.\nHello darkness, my old friend\nI've come to talk with you again\nBecause a vision softly creeping\nLeft its seeds while I was sleeping\nAnd the vision that was planted in my brain\nStill remains\nWithin the sound of silence\n-----\nTo me, this song also represents the improper communication with our mind.\nOur mind is The sound of silence.\nIt is ON when you close ur eyes.\nIt has to be listened, respected to believe and followed.\nAs the writer did, and we get this ultimate song.\n-----\nIn restless dreams I walked alone\nNarrow streets of cobblestone\nBeneath the halo of a street lamp\nI turned my collar to the cold and damp\nWhen my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light\nThat split the night\nAnd touched the sound of silence\n-----\nNow we open our eyes.\nWe look everywhere around us.\nWe switch on our TV.\nWe get majority of our thoughts from Screens(TV/Movies) i.e. Neon god.\nWe fill ourself with thoughts of People, Lifestyle, War, Fashion, Money, Cars,etc.\nThis makes our mind ponder to a thought.\n-----\nAnd in the naked light I saw\nTen thousand people, maybe more\nPeople talking without speaking\nPeople writing songs that voices never share\nAnd no one deared\nDisturb the sound of silence\n-----\n~\nWhen we watch TV, we find that we try to follow it in our life to completeness.\nWe follow it even though its fake and manipulated\nto fulfill some person's financial needs.\nIn screens, Actors just speak lines.\nIn screens, Actors just hear lines.\nIn screens, Actors dont express their actual thoughts.\nEveryone is afraid to touch what one's mind feels like speaking.\nThey are mere spectators, powerless and hollow from inside.\nAs they dont touch their own mind(sound of silence).\nSo we follow them too by being spectators and powerless in our life too.\nWe dont touch our what our mind(sound of silence) say.\n------\n\"Fools,\" said I, \"you do not know\nSilence like a cancer grows\nHear my words that I might teach you\nTake my arms that I might reach you\"\nBut my words like silent raindrops fell\nAnd echoed\nIn the wells of silence\n-----\nThe writer here ask us to act(Hear my words,take my arms).\nBecause if we keep only following screens\nand dont listen to our own mind(sound of silence)\nThen we will run after things dictated by screens our whole life.\nWe have no idea why we are doing that way and complain till end.\nBecause we have no idea what we really want and where our happiness lies.\nThats why everyday, we feel so hollow inside.\nThis hollowness(cancer) grows bigger and bigger.\nBut still nobody wants to touch that sound of silence(mind)\nWe look out for solution even though every solution is inside us.\nWe dont listen, we just hear it.\nand its accumulated in the sound of silence(mind) which we never listen.\n-----\nAnd the people bowed and prayed\nTo the neon god they made\nAnd the sign flashed out its warning\nIn the words that it was forming\nAnd the signs said the words of the prophets\nAre written on the subway walls\nAnd tenement halls\nAnd whispered in the sounds of silence\n-----\nBut still we go on with our screens(Neon god).\nNeon god laughs here and says to the writer\n\"Throughtout ages, all the prophets of all the religions have been saying the same things. Earlier it was kings then society, now its screens.\nTheir have found their place in outside world only (on walls and books)\nnot inside (the mind).\nIf they werent successful, where do you stand?\nYou will also find yourself at the same place i.e. outside the mind\"\nThats why millions may have listened to the songs.\nThousands have sung.\nBut very few will follow it even then.\nWe will still follow our neon gods,\nAnd not listen to our sound of silence.\nThus this song will hold significance till mankind remains,\nand we will just laugh at this paradox.\n\n"
