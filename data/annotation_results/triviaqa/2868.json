Call me a cynic, but if anyone knows of a single                             instance of a fake one pound coin ever having been handed into a police                             station, I'd love to know about it.\n \nthe undated 20p 'mule' coin\nThis fascinating 2008 minting error of the new design 20p coin                             generated much interest, and provides a wonderful example of how a daft mistake                             can undermine even the most rigorous quality assurance system.\nHere's the official story from the Royal Mint: \"...In November                             2008 a number of 20p coins were incorrectly minted resulting in their having no                             date. This problem affected less than 250,000 coins of the 136 million 20p                             pieces minted in 2008-09 and was due to the previous obverse (the 'heads' side)                             being used with the new reverse (the 'tails' side) design, meaning the year of                             issue did not feature at all. These coins remain legal tender and still have a face value                             of 20p...\"\nI love the way they say \"less than\", as if 250,000 coins could get                             lost down the back of a settee.\nDespite the numbers involved, the 20p 'mule' (slang for a faulty                             coin, based on the metaphor of a cross between a horse and a donkey) is worth a                             lot more than 20p, but not nearly as much as some of the bigger sums (thousands                             or even millions of pounds) at which they are occasionally offered for sale on                             auction websites. In late 2008 there would have been quite a lot of these in                             circulation - perhaps one in every five hundred or so, but not so many now.

London has for                             centuries been extremely cosmopolitan, both as a travel hub and a place for                             foreign people to live and work and start their own busineses. This contributed                             to the development of some ' lingua                             franca ' expressions, i.e., mixtures of Italian, Greek, Arabic, Yiddish                             (Jewish European/Hebrew dialect), Spanish and English which developed to enable                             understanding between people of different nationalities, rather like a pidgin or hybrid                             English. Certain lingua franca blended with 'parlyaree' or 'polari', which is                             basically underworld slang.\nBackslang also contributes several slang money words. Backslang                             reverses the phonetic (sound of the) word, not the spelling, which can produce                             some strange interpretations, and was popular among market traders, butchers                             and greengrocers.\nHere are the most common and/or interesting British slang money                             words and expressions, with meanings, and origins where known. Many are now                             obsolete; typically words which relate to pre-decimalisation coins, although                             some have re-emerged and continue to do so.\nSome non-slang words are included where their origins are                             particularly interesting, as are some interesting slang money expressions which                             originated in other parts of the world, and which are now entering the English                             language. Origins of official English money words appear in the main                             article.\nenglish slang money glossary\narcher - two thousand pounds (£2,000), late 20th                             century, from the Jeffrey Archer court case in which he was alleged to have                             bribed call-girl Monica Coughlan with this amount.\nayrton senna/ayrton - tenner (ten pounds, £10) -                             cockney rhyming slang created in the 1980s or early 90s, from the name of the                             peerless Brazilian world champion Formula One racing driver, Ayrton Senna                             (1960-94), who won world titles in 1988, 90 and 91, before his tragic death at                             San Marino in 1994.\nbag/bag of sand - grand = one thousand pounds (£1,000),                             seemingly recent cockney rhyming slang, in use from around the mid-1990s in                             Greater London; perhaps more widely too - let me                             know . (Thanks Ed Brock, May 2007)\nbanana - predominantly Australian slang from the 1960s for a £1 note (supposedly because one is 'sweet and acceptable'), although                             likely derived from earlier English/Australian use, like other slang symbolic                             of yellow/gold (canary, bumblebee, etc), to refer to a sovereign or guinea or                             other (as was) high value gold coin.\nbar - a pound, from the late 1800s, and earlier a sovereign,                             probably from Romany gypsy 'bauro' meaning heavy or big, and also influenced by                             allusion to the iron bars use as trading currency used with Africans, plus a                             possible reference to the custom of casting of precious metal in bars.\nbatter - money, slang from the late 1800s, derived partly                             because of the colour allusion to gold, and partly as a punning                             (double-meaning) reference to the action of making dough. This perhaps also                             gave rise (another pun, sorry), or at least supportive meaning to the use of                             batter (from 1800s) as a reference to a spending spree or binge.\nbender - sixpence (6d) Another slang term with origins in the                             1800s when the coins were actually solid silver, from the practice of testing                             authenticity by biting and bending the coin, which would being made of                             near-pure silver have been softer than the fakes.\nbeer tokens/beer vouchers - money - beer tokens/beer vouchers                             referred especially to pound notes before their discontinuation, subsequently                             transferring to pound coins, and higher value notes as beer prices have inflated. The expression is from the late 20th century. My personal experience                             of this expression (1970s South London) was as a humorous reference to the fact                             that young men's money was largely spent on beer, as if the note was valid only                             for that purpose, like a token or voucher. I am informed interestingly (thanks                             S Bayliss) that: \"...I regularly used this phrase during my formative years as                             a student. To me, 'beer tokens' were exactly that - tokens issued by Ansells                             Brewery in Birmingham to its staff (Ansells was part of the then vast UK Allied                             Breweries company). These tokens were valid in the brewery and in Ansells pubs                             for a pint of mild beer, but could be exchanged for other drinks if the                             difference in price was paid. This meant that I used to pay 2p for a pint of                             bitter or a whole 5p for a pint of lager, unfortunately Skol! My nights out                             were very cheap. These beer tokens were available before I worked in the                             brewery, which was first in 1977, and were a secondary form of remuneration in                             the brewery...\" Additional fascinating facts about beer and ale on the real ale page .\nbeehive - five pounds (£5). Cockney rhyming slang from                             1960s and perhaps earlier since beehive has meant the number five in rhyming                             slang since at least the 1920s.\nbees (bees and honey) - money. Cockney rhyming slang from the                             late 1800s. Also shortened to beesum (from bees and, bees 'n', to                             beesum).\nbice/byce - two shillings (2/-) or two pounds or twenty                             pounds - probably from the French bis, meaning twice, which suggests usage is                             older than the 1900s first recorded and referenced by dictionary sources. Bice                             could also occur in conjunction with other shilling slang, where the word bice                             assumes the meaning 'two', as in 'a bice of deaners', pronounced                             'bicerdeaners', and with other money slang, for example bice of tenners,                             pronounced 'bicertenners', meaning twenty pounds.\nbig ben - ten pounds (£10) the sum, and a ten pound                             note - cockney rhyming slang.\nbiscuit - £100 or £1,000. Initially suggested                             (Mar 2007) by a reader who tells me that the slang term 'biscuit', meaning £100, has been in use for several years, notably in the casino trade                             (thanks E). I am grateful also (thanks Paul, Apr 2007) for a further suggestion                             that 'biscuit' means £1,000 in the casino trade, which apparently is due                             to the larger size of the £1,000 chip. It would seem that the 'biscuit'                             slang term is still evolving and might mean different things (£100 or £1,000) to different people. I can find no other references to meanings                             or origins for the money term 'biscuit' and would be grateful for other                             evidence. Let me know .\nbit - (thruppenny bit,                             two-bob bit) - recorded first as 'thieves slang' for money in 1609, short                             simply for 'a bit of money'. In the US bit was first recorded in 1683 referring                             to \"...a small silver coin forming a fraction of the (then) Spanish dollar and                             its equivalent of the time...\" Elsewhere in the world during the 1700-1800s bit                             came generally to refer to the smallest silver coin of many different                             currencies. By 1829 the English slang bit referred more specifically to a                             fourpenny coin. By the 1900s the meaning applied to silver                             threepences/'thruppences' (see joey ), sixpences and also to                             florins (two shillings) and later that century very commonly and iconically to                             the beautiful twelve-sided brass threepence/thruppence (i.e., thruppenny                             bit, sixpenny bit and two-bob bit). (All that is according to OED 1922 and                             Partridge slang.) Quirkily, partly or wholly due to the pre-decimalisation                             introduction of the 50p coin in 1967 the term 'ten-bob bit' also emerged,                             because when first minted, until decimalistion in 1971, the 50p coin was                             officially a 'ten shilling coin', replacing the previous ten shilling note. The                             use of bit here was something of an ironic distortion and departure from the                             traditional references to coins of relatively low value, or perhaps a                             reflection of inflation..\nbitcoin - not slang and not old - Bitcoin is an electronic                             computerized currency. The word is a pun - computer bit and bit meaning a coin. See Bitcoin in the                             business glossary - it is a fascinating contrast with the cash and coinage                             concepts featured on this page.\nbluey - five pounds (£5), and especially a five pound                             note, because its colour was mainly blue for most of the latter half of the                             1900s. The blue fiver was introduced in 1957, replacing the white five pound                             note finally in 1961. White five pound notes, in different designs, date back                             to the 1830s, although there seems no record of 'whitey' as money slang.                             (Thanks J Bessent)\nbob - shilling (1/-),                             although in recent times means money in a general sense, or a pound or a dollar                             in certain regions. Historically bob was slang for a British shilling (Twelve                             old pence, pre-decimalisation - and twenty shillings to a pound - equating to                             5p now). There was and remains no plural version; it was 'thirty bob' not                             'thirty bobs', or 'a few bob' (meaning then and now, a relatively large sum of                             money) not 'a few bobs'. Prior to 1971 bob was one of the most commonly used                             English slang words. Arguably the word bob became so popular as we might question the word's slang status, for example the Boy Scouts and Cubs 'Bob-a                             Job' week tradition, (see Bob-a-Job above), was                             officially publicised and recognised for a couple of decades in British society                             pre-decimalisation. Now sadly gone from common use in the UK meaning shilling,                             bob is used now extremely rarely to mean 5p, the decimal equivalent of a                             shilling; in fact most young people would have no clue that it equates in this                             way. Bob more commonly now means money in a general sense, (as it did also                             pre-decimalisation), for example, 'it cost a few bob', which is usually a                             sarcastic allusion to quite a lot of money, or also, 'He's worth a few bob'. In                             pre-decimal days bob also referred to larger sums of money such as ten bob (ten                             shillings) or 'thirty bob' (one pound and ten shillings - 'one pound ten'), or                             fifty bob (two pounds ten shillings - 'two pound ten'). Far less commonly now                             bob translates to multiples of 5p, for example: 'ten bob' = 50p, and 'thirty                             bob' = £1.50, although these are quite rare terms now, and virtually                             unused among young folk. Other non-money slang meanings of bob exist, for                             example the noun meaning of poo (dung or excrement) or verb for same (to                             defecate); and the verb meaning of cheat. Bob is also a hairstyle, although                             none of these other meanings relate to the money slang. There are clear                             indications around the turn of the 20th to the 21st century that bob as money                             slang is being used to mean a pound, although this is far from common usage,                             and is perhaps more of an adaptation of the general monetary meaning, rather                             than an established specific term for the pound unit, as it once was for the                             shilling. Usage of bob for shilling dates back to the late 1700s. Origin of the                             word in this sense is not known for sure. Possibilities include a connection                             with the church or bell-ringing since 'bob' meant a set of changes rung on the                             bells. This would be consistent with one of the possible origins and                             associations of the root of the word Shilling, (from Proto-Germanic 'skell'                             meaning to sound or ring). There is possibly an association with plumb-bob,                             being another symbolic piece of metal, made of lead and used to mark a vertical                             position in certain trades, notably masons. Brewer's 1870 Dictionary of Phrase                             and Fable states that 'bob' could be derived from 'Bawbee', which was 16-19th                             century slang for a half-penny, in turn derived from: French 'bas billon',                             meaning debased copper money (coins were commonly cut to make change). Brewer                             also references the Laird of Sillabawby, a 16th century mintmaster, as a                             possible origin. 'Bob a nob', in the early 1800s meant 'a shilling a head',                             when estimating costs of meals, etc. In the 18th century 'bobstick' was a                             shillings-worth of gin. In parts of the US 'bob' was used for the US dollar                             coin. I am also informed (thanks K Inglott, March 2007) that bob is now slang                             for a pound in his part of the world (Bath, South-West England), and has also                             been used as money slang, presumably for Australian dollars, on the Home and                             Away TV soap series. A popular slang word like bob arguably develops a life of                             its own. Additionally (ack Martin Symington, Jun 2007) the word 'bob' is still                             commonly used among the white community of Tanzania in East Africa for the                             Tanzanian Shilling. As ever, more detail is                             welcome .\nboodle - money. There are many different interpretations of                             boodle meaning money, in the UK and the US. Boodle normally referred to                             ill-gotten gains, such as counterfeit notes or the proceeds of a robbery, and                             also to a roll of banknotes, although in recent times the usage has extended to                             all sorts of money, usually in fairly large amounts. Much variation in meaning                             is found in the US. The origins of boodle meaning money are (according to                             Cassells) probably from the Dutch word 'boedel' for personal effects or                             property (a person's worth) and/or from the old Scottish 'bodle' coin, worth                             two Scottish pence and one-sixth of an English penny, which logically would                             have been pre-decimalisation currency.\nbottle - two pounds, or earlier tuppence (2d), from the                             cockney rhyming slang: bottle of spruce = deuce (= two pounds or tuppence).                             Spruce probably mainly refers to spruce beer, made from the shoots of spruce                             fir trees which is made in alcoholic and non-alcoholic varieties. Separately bottle means money generally and particularly loose coinage, from the custom of                             passing a bottle for people to give money to a busker or street entertainer. I                             am also informed (ack Sue Batch, Nov 2007) that spruce also referred to                             lemonade, which is perhaps another source of the bottle rhyming slang: \"...                             around Northants, particularly the Rushden area, Spruce is in fact lemonade...                             it has died out nowadays - I was brought up in the 50s and 60s and it was an                             everyday word around my area back then. As kids growing up we always asked for                             a glass of spruce. It was quite an accepted name for lemonade...\"\nbrass - money. From the 16th century, and a popular                             expression the north of England, e.g., 'where there's muck there's brass' which                             incidentally alluded to certain trades involving scrap-metal, mess or waste,                             which to some offered very high earnings. This was also a defensive or                             retaliatory remark aimed at those of middle, higher or professional classes who                             might look down on certain 'working class' entrepreneurs or traders. The 'where                             there's much there's brass' expression helped maintain and spread the                             populairity iof the 'brass' money slang, rather than cause it. Brass originated                             as slang for money by association to the colour of gold coins, and the value of                             brass as a scrap metal. See separately 'maggie/brass maggie' .\nbrick - ten pounds or ten dollars (usually the banknote) -                             Australian slang from the early 1900s, derived from the red colour of the note                             and oblong shape. Also a prison sentence of ten years. (Thanks S Johnson)\nbread (bread and honey) - money. From cockney rhyming slang,                             bread and honey = money, and which gave rise to the secondary rhyming slang                             'poppy', from poppy red = bread. Bread also has associations with money, which                             in a metaphorical sense can be traced back to the Bible. Bread meaning money is                             also linked with with the expression 'earning a crust', which alludes to having                             enough money to pay for one's daily bread.\nbrown - a half-penny or ha'penny. An old term, probably more                             common in London than elsewhere, used before UK decimalisation in 1971, and                             before the ha'penny was withdrawn in the 1960s.\nbull - five shillings (5/-), a crown, equal to 25p. From the                             late 1700s to 1910s. A shortening of bull's eye. After about 1910 'a bull' more                             commonly referred to a counterfeit coin. Separately 'bull money' was slang from                             the late 1800s meaning money handed to a blackmailer, or a bribe given in                             return for silence.\nbull's eye - five shillings (5/-), a crown, equal to 25p.                             From the late 1600s to 1800s. Largely superseded in this meaning by the shortened 'bull' slang.\nbumblebee - American slang from the 1940s for a $1 bill,                             logically deriving from earlier English/US use, like other slang symbolic of                             yellow/gold (banana, canary, etc), referring to a sovereign or guinea or other                             (as was) high value gold coin.\nbunce - money, usually unexpected gain and extra to an agreed                             or predicted payment, typically not realised by the payer. Earlier English                             spelling was bunts or bunse, dating from the late 1700s or early 1800s                             (Cassells and Partridge). Origins are not certain. Bunts also used to refer to                             unwanted or unaccounted-for goods sold for a crafty gain by workers, and                             activity typically hidden from the business owner. Suggestions of origin                             include a supposed cockney rhyming slang shortening of bunsen burner (=                             earner), which is very appealing, but unlikely given the history of the word                             and spelling, notably that the slang money meaning pre-dated the invention of                             the bunsen burner, which was devised around 1857. (Thanks R Bambridge)\nbung - money in the form of a bribe, from the early English                             meaning of pocket and purse, and pick-pocket, according to Cassells derived                             from Frisian (North Netherlands) pung, meaning purse. Bung is also a verb,                             meaning to bribe someone by giving cash.\ncabbage - money in banknotes, 'folding' money - orginally US                             slang according to Cassells, from the 1900s, also used in the UK, logically                             arising because of the leaf allusion, and green was a common colour of dollar                             notes and pound notes (thanks R Maguire, who remembers the slang from Glasgow                             in 1970s).\ncanary - a guinea or sovereign or other gold coin, slang from                             the mid-1800s to 1900s, derived purely by association of the yellow/gold                             colours. Also, late 1800s, a half sovereign.\ncarpet - three pounds (£3) or three hundred pounds                             (£300), or sometimes thirty pounds (£30). This has confusing and                             convoluted origins, from as early as the late 1800s: It seems originally to                             have been a slang term for a three month prison sentence, based on the                             following: that 'carpet bag' was cockney rhyming slang for a 'drag', which was                             generally used to describe a three month sentence; also that in the prison                             workshops it supposedly took ninety days to produce a certain regulation-size                             piece of carpet; and there is also a belief that prisoners used to be awarded                             the luxury of a piece of carpet for their cell after three year's                             incarceration. The term has since the early 1900s been used by bookmakers and                             horse-racing, where carpet refers to odds of three-to-one, and in car dealing,                             where it refers to an amount of £300.\ncaser/case - five shillings (5/-), a crown coin. Seems to                             have surfaced first as caser in Australia in the mid-1800s from the Yiddish                             (Jewish European/Hebrew dialect) kesef meaning silver, where (in Australia) it                             also meant a five year prison term. Caser was slang also for a US dollar coin,                             and the US/Autralian slang logically transferred to English, either or all                             because of the reference to silver coin, dollar slang for a crown, or the                             comparable value, as was.\nchip - a shilling (1/-) and earlier, mid-late 1800s a pound                             or a sovereign. According to Cassells chip meaning a shilling is from                             horse-racing and betting. Chip was also slang for an Indian rupee. The                             association with a gambling chip is logical. Chip and chipping also have more                             general associations with money and particularly money-related crime, where the                             derivations become blurred with other underworld meanings of chip relating to                             sex and women (perhaps from the French 'chipie' meaning a vivacious woman) and                             narcotics (in which chip refers to diluting or skimming from a consignment, as                             in chipping off a small piece - of the drug or the profit). Chipping-in also                             means to contributing towards or paying towards something, which again relates                             to the gambling chip use and metaphor, i.e. putting chips into the centre of                             the table being necessary to continue playing.\nchump change - a relatively insiginificant amount of money -                             a recent expression (seemingly 2000s) originating in the US and now apparently                             entering UK usage. (Thanks M Johnson, Jan 2008)\nclod - a penny (1d). Clod was also used for other old copper                             coins. From cockney rhyming slang clodhopper (= copper). A clod is a lump of                             earth. A clodhopper is old slang for a farmer or bumpkin or lout, and was also                             a derogatory term used by the cavalry for infantry foot soldiers.\ncoal - a penny (1d). Also referred to money generally, from                             the late 1600s, when the slang was based simply on a metaphor of coal being an                             essential commodity for life. The spelling cole was also used. Common use of                             the coal/cole slang largely ceased by the 1800s although it continued in the                             expressions 'tip the cole' and 'post the cole', meaning to make a payment,                             until these too fell out of popular use by the 1900s. It is therefore unlikely                             that anyone today will use or recall this particular slang, but if the question                             arises you'll know the answer. Intriguingly I've been informed (thanks P Burns,                             8 Dec 2008) that the slang 'coal', seemingly referring to money - although I've                             seen a suggestion of it being a euphemism for coke (cocaine) - appears in the                             lyrics of the song Oxford Comma by the band Vampire weekend: \"Why would you lie                             about how much coal you have? Why would you lie about something dumb like that?...\" Please tell me any other modern usage examples like this. Or if                             anyone knows any of the Vampire Weekend folk and can confirm the meaning and                             source of this apparently resurrected slang, again please let me know.                             Additionally (thanks T Slater) there is probably some connection with the                             commonly used German slang term 'kohle' (coal) for money, although the                             direction of influence is unclear. At least one German dictionary (again thanks                             T Slater) suggests the 'kohle' slang derives from Yiddish 'kal'. If anyone has                             further information about this please let me know.\ncock and hen - ten pounds (thanks N Shipperley). The ten                             pound meaning of cock and hen is 20th century rhyming slang. Cock and hen -                             also cockerel and hen - has carried the rhyming slang meaning for the number                             ten for longer. Its transfer to ten pounds logically grew more popular through                             the inflationary 1900s as the ten pound amount and banknote became more common                             currency in people's wages and wallets, and therefore language. Cock and hen                             also gave raise to the variations cockeren, cockeren and hen, hen, and the                             natural rhyming slang short version, cock - all meaning ten pounds.\ncockeren - ten pounds, see cock and hen.\ncoffers - savings or funds - a coffer was originally a strongbox for money and valuables (first from Greek kophinos, basket), typically used by royalty. A 'cofferer' was an early (medieaval times) sort of accountant or  keeper of the monarch's financial books/money, at the time when money was kept in a 'counting house', and when this effectively represented the funds of the ruling authority. 'Coffer' and 'coffers' later came to refer to the treasury, detached from the monarchy, and in more recent times transferred to mean   money itself, of ordinary people. The sense of a box persists in usage, although most people will not understand this when, in questioning their own ability to afford something, they say things like, \"I'll have to see what's in the coffers..\"\ncommodore = fifteen pounds (£15). The origin is almost certainly London, and the                             clever and amusing derivation reflects the wit of Londoners: Cockney rhyming                             slang for five pounds is a 'lady', (from Lady Godiva = fiver); fifteen pounds                             is three-times five pounds (3x£5=£15); 'Three Times a Lady' is a                             song recorded by the group The Commodores; and there you have it: Three Times a                             Lady = fifteen pounds = a commodore. (Thanks Simon Ladd, Jun 2007)\ncoppers - pre-decimal farthings, ha'pennies and pennies, and                             to a lesser extent 1p and 2p coins since decimalisation, and also meaning a                             very small amount of money. Coppers was very popular slang pre-decimalisation                             (1971), and is still used in referring to modern pennies and two-penny coins,                             typically describing the copper (coloured) coins in one's pocket or change, or                             piggy bank. Pre-decimal farthings, ha'pennies and pennies were 97% copper                             (technically bronze), and would nowadays be worth significantly more than their                             old face value because copper has become so much more valuable. Decimal 1p and                             2p coins were also 97% copper (technically bronze - 97% copper, 2.5% zinc, 0.5%                             tin ) until replaced by copper-plated steel in 1992, which amusingly made them                             magnetic. The term coppers is also slang for a very small amount of money, or a                             cost of something typically less than a pound, usually referring to a bargain                             or a sum not worth thinking about, somewhat like saying 'peanuts' or 'a row of                             beans'. For example: \"What did you pay for that?\" ...... \"Coppers.\" (Thanks H                             Camrass for pointing out this omission from the glossary. There is a lot more                             about copper coins in the money                             history above.)\ncows - a pound, 1930s, from the rhyming slang 'cow's licker'                             = nicker (nicker means a pound). The word cows means a single pound since                             technically the word is cow's, from cow's licker.\ndaddler/dadla/dadler - threepenny bit (3d), and also earlier                             a farthing (quarter of an old penny, ¼d), from the early 1900s, based on                             association with the word tiddler, meaning something very small.\ndeaner/dena/denar/dener - a shilling (1/-), from the                             mid-1800s, derived from association with the many European dinar coins and                             similar, and derived in turn and associated with the Roman denarius coin which                             formed the basis of many European currencies and their names. The pronunciation                             emphasis tends to be on the long second syllable 'aah' sound. The expression is                             interpreted into Australian and New Zealand money slang as deener, again                             meaning shilling.\ndeep sea diver - fiver                             (£5), heard in use Oxfordshire (thanks Karen/Ewan) late 1990s, this is                             cockney rhyming slang still in use, dating originally from the 1940s.\ndelog/dilog/dlog - gold or gold money, logically extending                             more loosely to refer to money generally, first recorded in the mid-1800s. This                             is backslang - in this case a reversal of the word and formation of new word to                             represent the new sound - to confuse anyone who doesn't understand it.                             Backslang, like rhyming slang, thrived and continues to thrive in social                             environments where for reasons of secrecy or fun people develop language that                             is difficult for outsiders to understand.\ndeuce - two pounds, and much earlier (from the 1600s)                             tuppence (two old pence, 2d), from the French deus and Latin duos meaning two                             (which also give us the deuce term in tennis, meaning two points needed to                             win).\ndibs/dibbs - money. Dib was also US slang meaning $1 (one                             dollar), which presumably extended to more than one when pluralised. Origins of                             dib/dibs/dibbs are uncertain but probably relate to the old (early 1800s)                             children's game of dibs or dibstones played with the knuckle-bones of sheep or                             pebbles. Also relates to (but not necessairly derived from) the expression                             especially used by children, 'dibs' meaning a share or claim of something, and                             dibbing or dipping among a group of children, to determine shares or winnings                             or who would be 'it' for a subsequent chasing game. In this sort of dipping or                             dibbing, a dipping rhyme would be spoken, coinciding with the pointing or                             touchung of players in turn, eliminating the child on the final word, for                             example:\n'dip dip sky blue who's it not you' (the word 'you' meant                                 elimination for the corresponding child)\n'ibble-obble black bobble ibble obble out' ('out' meant                                 elimination)\n'one potato two potato three potato four\nfive potato six                                 potato seven potato more' ('more' meant elimination)\n(In this final                                 dipping/dibbing game the procedure was effectively doubled because the spoken                                 rhythm matched the touching of each contestant's two outstretched fists in turn                                 with the fist of the 'dipper' - who incidentally included him/herself in the                                 dipping by touching their own fists together twice, or if one of their own                                 fists was eliminated would touch their chin. The winner or 'it' would be the                                 person remaining with the last untouched fist. Players would put their fists                                 behind their backs when touched, and interstingly I can remember that as                                 children we would conform to the rules so diligently that our fists would                                 remain tightly clenched behind our backs until the dipping game had finished. I                                 guess this wouldn't happen today because each child would need at least one                                 hand free for holding their mobile phone and texting.)\ndinarly/dinarla/dinaly - a shilling (1/-), from the                             mid-1800s, also transferred later to the decimal equivalent 5p piece, from the                             same roots that produced the 'deaner' shilling slang and variations, i.e.,                             Roman denarius and then through other European dinar coins and variations. As                             with deanar the pronunciation emphasis tends to be on the long second syllable                             'aah' sound.\ndirty den - ten pounds                             (£10). Cockney rhyming slang , referring to the                             BBC TV 'Eastenders' soap series character Dennis Watts (landlord and abusive                             husband of Angie at the Queen Vic pub), which dates the origins of the                             expression to the mid-late1980s. Dennis Watts appeared in the first episode of                             the Eastenders series on 19 Feb 1985. Subsequently the Dirty Den nickname was                             popularised - not actually in the series itself - but by the UK tabloid press,                             which became and remains obsessively preoccupied with TV soap storylines and                             the actors portraying them, as if it were all real life and real news. Dennis                             'Dirty Den' Watts is one of the most iconic of all soap characters, enduring in                             the plot until finally being killed off (the second time, for good, probably)                             in 2005. The 1986 Christmas Day episode, heavily promoted by the popular media,                             in which Den handed divorce papers to his wife Angie, attracted the biggest                             ever recorded UK TV audience (30.15million), more than half the population. No                             wonder perhaps that such a slang term arose. Dirty Den is a good example of how                             language, and slang particularly, alter in response to popular fashion, and                             also more broadly is an example of the frighteningly powerful influence of                             popular media, especially the tabloid press, on the way we think and behave.                             (Thanks P Robinson-Griffin)\ndollar - slang for money, commonly                             used in singular form, eg., 'Got any dollar?..'. In earlier times a dollar was                             slang for an English Crown, five shillings (5/-), and 'half-a-dollar' was slang                             for the half-crown or two-and-sixpence coin (2/6 - two shillings and sixpence).                             From the 1900s in England and so called because the coin was similar in                             appearance and size to the American dollar coin, and at one time similar in                             value too. Brewer's dictionary of 1870 says that the American dollar is '..in                             English money a little more than four shillings..'. That's about 20p. The word                             dollar is originally derived from German 'Thaler', and earlier from Low German                             'dahler', meaning a valley (from which we also got the word 'dale'). The                             connection with coinage is that in the late 1400s the Counts of Schlick,                             Bohemia, mined silver from 'Joachim's Thal' (Joachim's Valley - now equating to                             Jáchymov, a spa town in NW Bohemia in the Czech Republic, close to the                             border to Germany), from which was minted the silver ounce coins called                             Joachim's Thalers. These coins became standard coinage in that region of what                             would now be Germany. All later generic versions of the coins were called                             'Thalers'. An 'oxford' was cockney rhyming slang for five shillings (5/-) based                             on the dollar rhyming slang: 'oxford scholar'.\ndosh - slang for a reasonable amount of spending money, for                             instance enough for a 'night-out'. Almost certainly and logically derived from                             the slang 'doss-house', meaning a very cheap hostel or room, from Elizabethan                             England when 'doss' was a straw bed, from 'dossel' meaning bundle of straw, in                             turn from the French 'dossier' meaning bundle. Dosh appears to have originated in this form in the US in the 19th century, and then re-emerged in more popular                             use in the UK in the mid-20th century.\ndoubloons - money. From the Spanish gold coins of the same                             name.\ndough - money. Mid-1800s slang obvious alternative for the                             slang bread. Dough later (1940s) also referred specifically to counterfeit                             money in underworld and criminal society.\ndoughnut/donut - meaning £75? - very recent perhaps -                             if you have any details at all about this please let me                             know - also (thanks A Briggs) 'doughnuts' means  zero(s) ($0) in Australia.\ndunop/doonup - pound, backslang from the mid-1800s, in which                             the slang is created from a reversal of the word sound, rather than the                             spelling, hence the loose correlation to the source word.\newif gens - five shillings, 1800s backslang, perhaps a                             phonetically pleasing distortion of evif meaning five.\newif yenneps - five pence (old pence, 5d), as above.\nexis gens - six shillings (6/-), backslang from the 1800s.                             See gens (backslang of shillings derived loosely via 'generalise').\nexis/exes - six pounds (£6), 20th century, earlier                             probably six shillings (6/-), logically implied by the fuller term 'exis gens'                             above, from the mid 1800s. Backslang (loosely the word-sound of six                             reversed).\nexis yenneps - sixpence (6d), 1800s backslang.\nexis-evif yenneps - eleven pence (old pence, 11d), 1800s                             backslang for six and five pennies (= eleven pennies). Strange but true.\nexis-ewif gens - one pound ten (£1 10/-) or thirty                             shillings - more weird backslang from the 1800s, derived from loosely reversing                             six (times) five shillings. See gen.\nfarthing - a quarter of an old penny (¼d) - not slang,                             a proper word in use (in slightly different form - feorthung) since the end of                             the first millenium, and in this list mainly to clarify that the origin of the                             word is not from 'four things', supposedly and commonly believed from the times                             when coins were split to make pieces of smaller value, but actually (less                             excitingly) from Old English feortha, meaning fourth, corresponding to Old                             Frisian fiardeng, meaning a quarter of a mark, and similar Germanic words                             meaning four and fourth. The modern form of farthing was first recorded in                             English around 1280 when it altered from ferthing to farthing.\nfiver - five pounds (£5), from the mid-1800s. More                             rarely from the early-mid 1900s fiver could also mean five thousand pounds, but                             arguably it remains today the most widely used slang term for five pounds.\nfin/finn/finny/finnif/finnip/finnup/finnio/finnif - five                             pounds (£5), from the early 1800s. There are other spelling variations                             based on the same theme, all derived from the German and Yiddish                             (European/Hebrew mixture) funf, meaning five, more precisely spelled fünf.                             A 'double-finnif' (or double-fin, etc) means ten pounds; 'half-a-fin'                             (half-a-finnip, etc) would have been two pounds ten shillings (equal to £2.50). See also 'long-tailed-finnip', meaning ten pounds.\nflag - five pound note (£5), UK, notably in Manchester                             (ack Michael Hicks); also a USA one dollar bill; also used as a slang term for                             a money note in Australia although Cassells is vague about the value (if you                             know please contact us ). The word flag has been                             used since the 1500s as a slang expression for various types of money, and more                             recently for certain notes. Originally (16th-19thC) the slang word flag was                             used for an English fourpenny groat coin, derived possibly from Middle Low                             German word 'Vleger' meaning a coin worth 'more than a Bremer groat'                             (Cassells). Derivation in the USA would likely also have been influenced by the                             slang expression 'Jewish Flag' or 'Jews Flag' for a $1 bill, from early 20th                             century, being an envious derogatory reference to perceived and stereotypical                             Jewish success in business and finance.\nflim/flimsy - five pounds (£5), early 1900s, so called                             because of the thin and flimsy paper on which five pound notes of the time were                             printed.\nflorin/flo - a two shilling or 'two bob' coin (florin is                             actually not slang - it's from Latin meaning flower, and a 14th century                             Florentine coin called the Floren). Equivalent to 10p - a tenth of a pound. A                             'flo' is the slang shortening, meaning two shillings.\nfolding/folding stuff/folding money/folding green =                             banknotes, especially to differentiate or emphasise an amount of money as would                             be impractical to carry or pay in coins, typically for a night out or to settle                             a bill. Folding, folding stuff and folding money are all popular slang in                             London. Folding green is more American than UK slang. Cassells says these were                             first recorded in the 1930s, and suggests they all originated in the US, which                             might be true given that banknotes arguably entered very wide use earlier in                             the US than in the UK. (Thanks P Jones, June 2008)\nfoont/funt = a pound (£1), from the mid-1900s, derived from the German word 'pfund' for the UK pound.\nfrench/french loaf - four pounds, most likely from the second                             half of the 1900s, cockney rhyming slang for rofe (french loaf = rofe), which                             is backslang for four, also meaning four pounds. Easy when you know how..\ng/G - a thousand pounds. Shortening of 'grand' (see below).                             From the 1920s, and popular slang in fast-moving business, trading, the                             underworld, etc., until the 1970s when it was largely replaced by 'K'. Usually                             retains singular form (G rather than G's) for more than one thousand pounds,                             for example \"Twenty G\".\ngarden/garden gate - eight pounds (£8), cockney rhyming                             slang for eight, naturally extended to eight pounds. In spoken use 'a garden'                             is eight pounds. Incidentally garden gate is also rhyming slang for magistrate,                             and the plural garden gates is rhyming slang for rates. The word garden                             features strongly in London, in famous place names such as Hatton Garden, the                             diamond quarter in the central City of London, and Covent Garden, the site of                             the old vegetable market in West London, and also the term appears in sexual                             euphemisms, such as 'sitting in the garden with the gate unlocked', which                             refers to a careless pregnancy.\ngelt/gelter - money, from the late 1600s, with roots in foreign words for gold, notably German and Yiddish (Jewish European/Hebrew                             dialect) gelt, and Dutch and South African geld.\ngen - a shilling (1/-), from the mid 1800s, either based on                             the word argent, meaning silver (from French and Latin, and used in English                             heraldry, i.e., coats of arms and shields, to refer to the colour silver), or                             more likely a shortening of 'generalize', a peculiar supposed backslang of                             shilling, which in its own right was certainly slang for shilling, and                             strangely also the verb to lend a shilling.\ngeneralise/generalize - a shilling (1/-), from the mid 1800s,                             thought to be backslang. Also meant to lend a shilling, apparently used by the                             middle classes, presumably to avoid embarrassment. Given that backslang is                             based on phonetic word sound not spelling, the conversion of shilling to                             generalize is just about understandable, if somewhat tenuous, and in the                             absence of other explanation is the only known possible derivation of this odd                             slang.\ngen net/net gen - ten shillings (1/-), backslang from                             the 1800s (from 'ten gen').\ngingerbread - money, wealth. From the late 1600s to mid                             1800s, deriving by association to the colour of gold and gold coins, and no                             doubt supported by the inclusion of the word bread, with its own monetary                             meanings.\ngoree/gory/old Mr Gory - money, from the late 1600s until the                             early 1800s, and rare since then. This slang derived from the island of Goree                             (also referred to as Fort Goree) part of and close to Senegal on the West                             African coast, which was and remains symbolic in the slave trade.\ngrand - a thousand pounds (£1,000 or $1,000) Not                             pluralised in full form. Shortened to 'G' (usually plural form also) or less                             commonly 'G's'. Originated in the USA in the 1920s, logically an association                             with the literal meaning - full or large.\ngreens - money, usually old-style green coloured pound notes,                             but actully applying to all money or cash-earnings since the slang derives from                             the cockney rhyming slang: 'greengages' (= wages).\ngroat - an old silver four-penny coin from around 1300 and in                             use in similar form until c.1662, although Brewer states in his late 1800s                             revised edition of his 1870 dictionary of slang that 'the modern groat was                             introduced in 1835, and withdrawn in 1887', which is somewhat confusing.                             Presumably there were different versions and issues of the groat coin, which                             seems to have been present in the coinage from the 14th to the 19th centuries.                             Very occasionally older people, students of English or History, etc., refer to                             loose change of a small amount of coin money as groats. Sadly the word is                             almost obsolete now, although the groat coin is kept alive in Maundy Money . The word derives from Middle English                             and Middle Dutch 'groot' meaning 'great' since this coin was a big one,                             compared to a penny. The similar German and Austrian coin was the 'Groschen',                             equivalent to 10 'Pfennigs'. The word can actually be traced back to Roman                             times, when a 'Denarius Grossus' was a 'thick penny' (equivalent).\nguinea - guinea is not a slang term, it's a proper and                             historical word for an amount of money equating to twenty-one shillings, or in                             modern sterling one pound five pence. See the guinea                             history above.\nhalf, half a bar/half a sheet/half a nicker - ten shillings                             (10/-), from the 1900s, and to a lesser degree after decimalisation, fifty                             pence (50p), based on the earlier meanings of bar and sheet for a pound. Half                             is also used as a logical prefix for many slang words which mean a pound, to                             form a slang expresion for ten shillings and more recently fifty pence (50p),                             for example and most popularly, 'half a nicker', 'half a quid', etc. The use of                             the word 'half' alone to mean 50p seemingly never gaught on, unless anyone can                             confirm otherwise.\nhalf a crown - two shillings and sixpence (2/6), and more                             specifically the 2/6 coin. Not actually slang, more an informal and extremely                             common pre-decimalisation term used as readily as 'two-and-six' in referring to                             that amount. Equivalent to 12½p in decimal money.\nhalf a dollar - slang for the half-crown coin (i.e.,                             two-and-sixpence, 2/6, two-shillings and sixpence) - early and mid 1900s slang                             based on the 'dollar' slang for five shillings. Five shillings was not a                             currency coin at that time, instead it was a variously designed commemorative                             coin. Five shillings equated loosely to the value of a US dollar at that time.                             (Thanks Raymond Lewis for confirming that: \"...In the years following the                             second world war [1939-45] I recall two-and-sixpence was referred to as 'half a                             dollar', there being four US dollars to the pound for many years, so that a                             dollar equivalent in UK was five shillings; 2s/6d being half of five shillings.                             Our family [Merseysiders] and our family in Manchester always used this                             term...\")\nhandbag - money, late 20th century.\nhandful - five pounds (£5), 20th century, derived                             simply by association to the five digits on a hand.\nharold - five pounds (£5) - usually a five pound note -                             derived from 1970s soul band Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes, because the five                             pound note was traditionally very blue. (Thanks S Faber)\nhog - confusingly a shilling (1/-) or a sixpence (6d) or a                             half-crown (2/6), dating back to the 1600s in relation to shilling. Hog also                             extended to US 10c and dollar coins, apparently, according to Cassells because                             coins carried a picture of a pig. I suspect different reasons for the British                             coins, but have yet to find them.\njack - a pound, and earlier (from the 1600s), a farthing.                             Perhaps based on jack meaning a small thing, although there are many possible                             different sources. Jack is much used in a wide variety of slang                             expressions.\njacks - five pounds, from cockney rhyming slang: jack's alive                             = five. Not used in the singular for in this sense, for example a five pound                             note would be called a 'jacks'.\njob - guinea, late 1600s, probably ultimately derived from                             from the earlier meaning of the word job, a lump or piece (from 14th century                             English gobbe), which developed into the work-related meaning of job, and                             thereby came to have general meaning of payment for work, including specific                             meaning of a guinea. 'Half a job' was half a guinea.\njoey - much debate about this: According                             to my information (1894 Brewer, and the modern Cassell's, Oxford, Morton, and                             various other sources) Joey was originally, from 1835 or 1836 a silver                             fourpenny piece called a groat (Brewer is firm about this), and this meaning                             subsequently transferred to the silver threepenny piece (Cassell's, Oxford, and                             Morton). I'm convinced these were the principal and most common usages of the                             Joey coin slang. Cassell's says Joey was also used for the brass-nickel                             threepenny bit, which was introduced in 1937, although as a child in South                             London the 1960s I cannot remember the threepenny bit ever being called a Joey,                             and neither can my Mum or Dad, who both say a Joey in London was a silver                             threepence and nothing else (although they'd be too young to remember                             groats...). I'm informed however (ack Stuart Taylor, Dec 2006) that Joey was                             indeed slang for the brass-nickel threepenny bit among children of the                             Worcester area in the period up to decimalisation in 1971, so as ever, slang is                             subject to regional variation. There was some transference of the Joey slang to                             the sixpence (tanner) some time after the silver threepenny coin changed to the                             brass threepenny bit (which was during the 1930-40s), and this would have been                             understandable because the silver sixpence was similar to the silver                             threepence, albeit slightly larger. There is also a view that Joey transferred                             from the threepenny bit to the sixpence when the latter became a more usual                             minimum fare in London taxi-cabs. So although the fourpenny groat and the                             silver threepenny coin arguably lay the major claim to the Joey title, usage                             also seems to have extended to later coins, notably the silver sixpence                             (tanner) and the brass-nickel threepenny bit. The Joey slang word seems                             reasonably certainly to have been named after the politician Joseph Hume                             (1777-1855), who advocated successfully that the fourpenny groat be                             reintroduced, which it was in 1835 or 1836, chiefly to foil London cab drivers                             (horse driven ones in those days) in their practice of pretending not to have                             change, with the intention of extorting a bigger tip, particularly when given                             two shillings for a two-mile fare, which at the time cost one shilling and                             eight-pence. The re-introduction of the groat thus enabled many customers to                             pay the exact fare, and so the cab drivers used the term Joey as a derisory                             reference for the fourpenny groats.\nAnd some further clarification and background:\nBrewer says that the 'modern groat was introduced in 1835, and                                 withdrawn in 1887'. He was referring to the fact that the groat's production                                 ceased from 1662 and then restarted in 1835, (or 1836 according to other                                 sources). This coincides with the view that Hume re-introduced the groat to                                 counter the cab drivers' scam.\nSilver threepenny coins were first introduced in the mid-1500s                                 but were not popular nor minted in any serious quantity for general circulation                                 until around 1760, because people preferred the fourpenny groat. The silver                                 threepence was effectively replaced with introduction of the brass-nickel                                 threepenny bit in 1937, through to 1945, which was the last minting of the                                 silver threepence coin. The silver threepence continued in circulation for                                 several years after this, and I read here of someone receiving one in their change as late as 1959.\nThe brass-nickel threepenny bit was minted up until 1970 and this                                 lovely coin ceased to be legal tender at                                 decimalisation in 1971. As a matter of interest, in Nov 2004 a mint condition                                 1937 threepenny bit was being offered for sale by London Bloomsbury coin                                 dealers and auctioneers Spink, with a guide price of £37,000. Wow.\nThe silver sixpence was produced from 1547-1970, and remained in                                 circulation (although by then it was a copper-based and nickel-coated coin)                                 after decimalisation as the two-and-a-half-pee, until withdrawal in 1980.\nI was sent this additional clarification about the silver                                 threepenny piece (thanks C Mancini, Dec 2007) provided by Joseph Payne,                                 Assistant Curator of the Royal Mint: \"... Along with the silver crown,                                 half-crown and sixpence, the silver threepence made its first appearance in                                 1551 during the reign of Edward VI (1547-53). Silver threepences were last                                 issued for circulation in the United Kingdom in 1941 but the final pieces to be                                 sent overseas for colonial use were dated 1944. Once the issue of silver                                 threepences in the United Kingdom had ceased there was a tendency for the coins                                 to be hoarded and comparatively few were ever returned to the Royal Mint. The                                 coin was not formally demonetised until 31 August 1971 at the time of                                 decimalisation.\"\nk/K - a thousand (£1,000 or $1,000). From the 1960s,                             becoming widely used in the 1970s. Plural uses singular form. 'K' has now                             mainly replaced 'G' in common speech and especially among middle and                             professional classes. While some etymology sources suggest that 'k' (obviously                             pronounced 'kay') is from business-speak and underworld language derived from                             the K abbreviation of kilograms, kilometres, I am inclined to prefer the                             derivation (suggested to me by Terry Davies) that K instead originates from computer-speak in the early 1970s, from the abbreviation of kilobytes. For Terry's detailed and fascinating explanation of the                             history of K see the ' K'                             entry on the cliches and words origins page .\nkibosh/kybosh - eighteen pence (i.e., one and six, 1/6, one                             shilling and sixpence), related to and perhaps derived from the mid-1900s                             meaning of kibosh for an eighteen month prison sentence. Cassells implies an                             interesting possible combination of the meanings kibosh (18 month sentence),                             kibosh (meaning ruin or destroy) - both probably derived from Yiddish (Jewish                             European/Hebrew dialect) words meaning suppress - with the linking of money and                             hitting something, as in 'a fourpenny one' (from rhyming slang fourpenny bit =                             hit). All very vague and confusing. Whatever, kibosh meant a shilling and                             sixpence (1/6). Like so much slang, kibosh trips off the tongue easily and                             amusingly, which would encourage the extension of its use from prison term to                             money.\nkick - sixpence (6d), from the early 1700s, derived purely                             from the lose rhyming with six (not cockney rhyming slang), extending to and                             possible preceded and prompted by the slang expression 'two and a kick' meaning                             half a crown, i.e., two shillings and sixpence, commonly expressed as 'two and                             six', which is a more understandable association.\nknicker - distortion of 'nicker', meaning £1.

See also 'pair of knickers'.\nlady/Lady Godiva - fiver (five pounds, £5) cockney                             rhyming slang, and like many others in this listing is popular in London and                             the South East of England, especially East London. See also the very clever 'commodore' above. (Thanks                             Simon Ladd, June 2007)\nlolly - money. More popular in the 1960s than today. Precise                             origin unknown. Possibly rhyming slang linking lollipop to copper.\nlong-tailed 'un/long-tailed finnip - high value note, from                             the 1800s and in use to the late 1900s. Earlier 'long-tailed finnip' meant more                             specifically ten pounds, since a finnip was five pounds (see fin/finny/finnip)                             from Yiddish funf meaning five. There seems no explanation for long-tailed                             other than being a reference to extended or larger value.\nmacaroni - twenty-five pounds (£25). Cockney rhyming                             slang for pony.\nmadza caroon - half-a-crown (2/6) from the mid 1800s. A                             combination of medza, a corruption of Italian mezzo meaning half, and a                             mispronunciation or interpretation of crown. Madza caroon is an example of                             'ligua franca' slang which in this context means langauge used or influenced by                             foreigners or immigrants, like a sort of pidgin or hybrid English-foreign                             slang, in this case mixed with Italian, which logically implies that much of                             the early usage was in the English Italian communities. Mezzo/madza was and is                             potentially confused with, and popularity supported by, the similar 'motsa'                             (see motsa entry).\nmadza poona - half-sovereign, from the mid 1800s, for the                             same reasons as madza caroon.\nmaggie/brass maggie -                             a pound coin (£1) - apparently used in South Yorkshire UK - the story is                             that the slang was adopted during the extremely acrimonious and prolonged                             miners' strike of 1984 which coincided with the introduction of the pound coin.                             Margaret Thatcher acted firmly and ruthlessly in resisting the efforts of the                             miners and the unions to save the pit jobs and the British coalmining industry,                             reinforcing her reputation for exercising the full powers of the state,                             creating resentment among many. When the pound coin appeared it was immediately                             christened a 'Maggie', based seemingly on the notion that it was '...a brassy                             piece that thinks it's a sovereign...\" (ack J Jamieson, Sep 2007) If you have                             more detail about where and when this slang arose and is used, please let me know . I am grateful to J Briggs for                             confirming (March 2008): \"...I live in Penistone, South Yorks (what we call the                             West Riding) and it was certainly called a 'Brass Maggie' in my area. Typically                             in a derisive way, such as 'I wouldn't give you a brass maggie for that' for                             something overpriced but low value. It never really caught on and has died out                             now...\" And additionally (thanks A Volk) \"...living in the UK in 1983-84 I                             heard that the newly introduced pound coin was the Maggie because it was 'hard,                             rough edged, and pretends to be a sovereign...' \" Also (thanks M Wilson) \"I                             remember the joke about the pound coin being a 'maggie... it's hard, brassy,                             unpopular, and thinks it's a sovereign...' ''\nmarygold/marigold - a million pounds (£1,000,000).                             English slang referenced by Brewer in 1870, origin unclear, possibly related to                             the Virgin Mary, and a style of church windows featuring her image.\nMcGarrett - fifty pounds (£50). Initially London slang,                             especially for a fifty pound note. McGarret refers cunningly and amusingly to                             the popular US TV crime series Hawaii Five-0 and its fictional head detective                             Steve McGarrett, played by Jack Lord. The series was made and aired originally                             between 1968 and 1980 and developed a lasting cult following, not least due to                             the very cool appeal of the McGarrett character. Steve McGarrett was given the                             legendary line (every week virtually) \"Book 'em Danno,\" - or \"Book him Danno,\"                             - depending on the number of baddies they caught. Danno (Detective Danny                             Williams, played by James MacArthur) was McGarrett's unfailingly loyal junior                             partner. For the record, the other detectives were called Chin Ho Kelly (the old guy) and Kono Kalakaua (the big guy), played by Kam Fong and Zulu, both of                             which seem far better character names, but that's really the way it was.                             (Thanks L Cunliffe)\nmedza/medzer/medzes/medzies/metzes/midzers - money. Other                             variations occur, including the misunderstanding of these to be 'measures',                             which has become slang for money in its own right. These slang words for money                             are most likely derived from the older use of the word madza, absorbed into                             English from Italian mezzo meaning half, which was used as a prefix in                             referring to half-units of coinage (and weights), notably medza caroon                             (half-crown), madza poona (half-sovereign) and by itself, medza meaning a                             ha'penny (½d). Potentially confused with and supported by the origins                             and use of similar motsa (see motsa entry).\nmeasures - money, late 20th century, most likely arising from                             misunderstanding medzas and similar variants, particularly medza caroon                             (hal-crown) and medza meaning a half-penny (ha'penny, i.e., ½d).\nmeg - a thrupenny bit (3d) - and earlier (from the 1700s)                             also as megg, mag, magg, meag, general slang for various coins including first                             a ha'penny (½d) or a guinea, later a penny (1d), and in the US a dollar                             and a cent. Related, the verb, to meg, meant to swindle or cheat, from the                             1800s. (Thanks P McCormack, who informed me that meg was Liverpool slang for a                             thrupenny bit.)\nmelvin - five pounds (£5) - see harold - based on                             association with soul band Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes (the five pound note                             was very blue in the 1960s-70s). (Thanks S Faber)\nmill - a million dollars or a million pounds. Interestingly                             mill is also a non-slang technical term for a tenth of a USA cent, or                             one-thousandth of a dollar, which is an accounts term only - there is no                             coinage for such an amount. The word mill is derived simply from the Latin                             'millisimus' meaning a thousandth, and is not anything to do with the milled                             edge of a coin.\nmonkey - five hundred pounds (£500). Probably London                             slang from the early 1800s. Origin unknown. Like the 'pony' meaning £25,                             it is suggested by some that the association derives from Indian rupee                             banknotes featuring the animal.\nmoola - money. Variations on the same theme are moolah, mola,                             mulla. Modern slang from London, apparently originating in the USA in the                             1930s. Probably related to 'motsa' below.\nmotsa/motsah/motzer - money. Popular Australian slang for                             money, now being adopted elsewhere. Variations on the same theme are motser, motzer, motza, all from the Yiddish (Jewish European/Hebrew dialect) word                             'matzah', the unleavened bread originally shaped like a large flat disk, but                             now more commonly square (for easier packaging and shipping), eaten at                             Passover, which suggests earliest origins could have been where Jewish                             communities connected with English speakers, eg., New York or London (thanks G                             Kahl). Popularity is supported (and probably confused also) with ' lingua franca ' medza/madza and the                             many variations around these, which probably originated from a different                             source, namely the Italian mezzo, meaning half (as in madza poona = half                             sovereign).\nned - a guinea. A slang word used in Britain and chiefly                             London from around 1750-1850. Ned was seemingly not pluralised when referring                             to a number of guineas, eg., 'It'll cost you ten ned..' A half-ned was half a                             guinea. (see the notes about guineas ). The slang ned                             appears in at least one of Bruce Alexander's Blind Justice series of books                             (thanks P Bostock for raising this) set in London's Covent Garden area and a                             period of George III's reign from around 1760 onwards. It is conceivable that                             the use also later transferred for a while to a soverign and a pound, being                             similar currency units, although I'm not aware of specific evidence of this.                             The ned slang word certainly transferred to America, around 1850, and apparently was used up to the 1920s. In the US a ned was a ten dollar gold                             coin, and a half-ned was a five dollar coin. Precise origin of the word ned is                             uncertain although it is connected indirectly (by Chambers and Cassells for                             example) with a straightforward rhyming slang for the word head (conventional cockney rhyming slang is slightly more complex than                             this), which seems plausible given that the monarch's head appeared on guinea                             coins. Ned was traditionally used as a generic name for a man around these                             times, as evidenced by its meaning extending to a thuggish man or youth, or a                             petty criminal (US), and also a reference (mainly in the US) to the devil, (old                             Ned, raising merry Ned, etc). These, and the rhyming head connection, are not                             factual origins of how ned became a slang money term; they are merely                             suggestions of possible usage origin and/or reinforcement.\nnet gen - ten shillings (10/-), backslang, see gen net.\nnevis/neves - seven pounds (£7), 20th century                             backslang, and earlier, 1800s (usually as 'nevis gens') seven shillings                             (7/-).\nnicker - a pound (£1). Not pluralised for a number of                             pounds, eg., 'It cost me twenty nicker..' From the early 1900s, London slang,                             precise origin unknown. Possibly connected to the use of nickel in the minting                             of coins, and to the American slang use of nickel to mean a $5 dollar note,                             which at the late 1800s was valued not far from a pound. In the US a nickel is                             more commonly a five cent coin. A nicker bit is a one pound coin, and London                             cockney rhyming slang uses the expression 'nicker bits' to describe a case of                             diarrhoea.\nnugget/nuggets - a pound coin (£1) or money generally.                             The older nuggets meaning of money obviously alludes to gold nuggets and                             appeared first in the 1800s. Much more recently (thanks G Hudson) logically                             since the pound coin was introduced in the UK in the 1990s with the pound                             note's withdrawal, nugget seems to have appeared as a specific term for a pound                             coin, presumably because the pound coin is golden (actually more brassy than                             gold) and 'nuggety' in feel. Please let me know if                             you can add more detail about the use of nugget meaning pound coin.\noner - (pronounced 'wunner'), commonly now meaning one                             hundred pounds; sometimes one thousand pounds, depending on context. In the                             1800s a oner was normally a shilling, and in the early 1900s a oner was one                             pound.\noncer - (pronounced 'wunser'), a pound , and a simple                             variation of 'oner'. From the early 1900s, and like many of these slang words                             popular among Londoners (ack K Collard) from whom such terms spread notably via City traders and also the armed forces during the 2nd World War.\noxford - five shillings (5/-), also called a crown, from                             cockney rhyming slang oxford scholar = dollar, dollar being slang for a                             crown.\npair of nickers/pair of knickers/pair o'nickers - two pounds                             (£2), an irresistible pun.\npenny-ha'penny/penny-ayp'ney - (1½d) one-and-a-half                             pennies - no coin existed for this amount, although it was a common and not                             unreasonable pre-decimal sweetshop total for a typical child on a budget, given                             that weekly pocket money in those days was for many children thruppence, or                             sixpence if you were lucky. (Thanks V)\nplum - One hundred thousand pounds (£100,000). As                             referenced by Brewer in 1870. Seemingly no longer used. Origin unknown,                             although I received an interesting suggestion (thanks Giles Simmons, March                             2007) of a possible connection with Jack Horner's plum in the nursery rhyme.                             The Jack Horner nursery rhyme is seemingly based on the story of Jack Horner, a                             steward to the Bishop of Glastonbury at the time of the dissolution of the                             monasteries (16th century), who was sent to Henry VIII with a bribe consisting                             of the deeds to twelve important properties in the area. Horner, so the story                             goes, believing the bribe to be a waste of time, kept for himself the best (the                             'plum') of these properties, Mells Manor (near Mells, Frome, Somerset), in                             which apparently Horner's descendents still lived until quite recently. The                             Bishop was not so fortunate - he was hung drawn and quartered for remaining                             loyal to the Pope. If you have any more information about this possible 'plum'                             connection please let me know .\npony - twenty-five pounds (£25). From the late 18th                             century according to most sources, London slang, but the precise origin is not                             known. Also expressed in cockney rhyming slang as 'macaroni'. It is suggested                             by some that the pony slang for £25 derives from the typical price paid                             for a small horse, but in those times £25 would have been an unusually                             high price for a pony. Others have suggested that an Indian twenty-five rupee                             banknote featured a pony. Another suggestion (Ack P Bessell) is that pony might                             derive from the Latin words 'legem pone', which (according to the etymology                             source emtymonline.com) means, \"........ 'payment of money, cash down,' [which                             interpretation apparently first appeared in] 1573, from first two words [and                             also the subtitle] of the fifth division of Psalm cxix [Psalm 119, verses 33 to                             48, from the Bible's Old Testament], which begins the psalms at Matins on the                             25th of the month; consequently associated with March 25, a quarter day in the                             old financial calendar, when payments and debts came due....\" The words 'Legem                             pone' do not translate literally into monetary meaning, in the Psalm they words                             actully seem to equate to 'Teach me..' which is the corresponding phrase in the                             King James edition of the Bible. Other suggestions connecting the word pony                             with money include the Old German word 'poniren' meaning to pay, and a strange                             expression from the early 1800s, \"There's no touching her, even for a poney                             [sic],\" which apparently referred to a widow, Mrs Robinson, both of which                             appear in a collection of 'answers to correspondents' sent by readers and                             published by the Daily Mail in the 1990s.\npoppy - money. Cockney rhyming slang, from 'poppy red' =                             bread, in turn from 'bread and honey' = money.\nquarter - five shillings (5/-) from the 1800s, meaning a                             quarter of a pound. More recently (1900s) the slang 'a quarter' has transfered                             to twenty-five pounds.\nquid - one pound (£1) or a number of pounds sterling.                             Plural uses singular form, eg., 'Fifteen quid is all I want for it..', or 'I                             won five hundred quid on the horses yesterday..'. The slang money expression                             'quid' seems first to have appeared in late 1600s England, derived from Latin                             (quid meaning 'what', as in 'quid pro quo' - 'something for something else').                             Other intriguing possible origins/influences include a suggested connection with the highly secretive Quidhampton banknote paper-mill, and the term quid as                             applied (ack D Murray) to chewing tobacco, which are explained in more detail                             under quid in the cliches,                             words and slang page .\nreadies - money, usually banknotes. Simply derived from the                             expression 'ready cash' or 'ready money'. Earlier usage, now far less common,                             was just 'ready' or 'the ready'.\nrevif - five pounds (£5), backslang for fiver.\nrhino - £250, apparently in the Worcester area, (ack S                             Taylor). Cassells suggests rhino (also ryno and rino) meant money in the late                             1600s, perhaps alluding to the value of the creature for the illicit                             aphrodisiac trade. I am informed (thanks S London) that the term rhino appears                             in American author Washington Irving's story The Devil and Tom Walker, which is                             set in 1730s New England, published in 1824. Here rhino refers to a large sum                             of money, not a specific amount. Let me know if you                             have other details about rhino money slang.\nrofe - four pounds (£4), backslang, also meaning a four                             year prison term, which usage dates back to the mid-1800s. Such a long time ago                             the rofe money slang more likely would have meant fourpence rather than four                             pounds, much like the trend for other slang to transfer from pennies to pounds,                             as the money used by ordinary people shifts with inflation to the higher                             values.\nsaucepan - a pound, late 1800s, cockney rhyming slang:                             saucepan lid = quid.\nscore - twenty pounds (£20). From the 1900s, simply                             from the word 'score' meaning twenty, derived apparently from the ancient                             practice of counting sheep in lots of twenty, and keeping tally by cutting                             ('scoring') notches into a stick.\nshekels/sheckles - money. Not always, but often refers to                             money in coins, and can also refer to riches or wealth. From the Hebrew word                             and Israeli monetary unit 'shekel' derived in Hebrew from the silver coin                             'sekel' in turn from the word for weight 'sakal'.\nseymour - salary of £100,000 a year - media industry                             slang - named after Geoff Seymour (1947-2009) the advertising copywriter said                             to have been the first in his profession to command such a wage. Seymour                             created the classic 1973 Hovis TV advert featuring the baker's boy delivering                             bread from a bike on an old cobbled hill in a North England town, to the theme                             of Dvorak's New World symphony played by a brass band. The actual setting was                             in fact Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, Dorset. Incidentally the Hovis bakery was                             founded in 1886 and the Hovis name derives from Latin, Hominis Vis, meaning                             'strength of man'. The 1973 advert's artistic director was Ridley                             Scott.\nshilling - a silver or silver coloured coin worth twelve                             pre-decimalisation pennies (12d). From Old High German 'skilling'. Similar                             words for coins and meanings are found all over Europe. The original derivation                             was either from Proto-Germanic 'skell' meaning to sound or ring, or                             Indo-European 'skell' split or divide. Some think the root might be from                             Proto-Germanic 'skeld', meaning shield.\nshrapnel - loose change, especially a heavy and inconvenient                             pocketful, as when someone repays a small loan in lots of coins. The expression                             came into use with this meaning when wartime sensitivities subsided around                             1960-70s. Shrapnel conventionally means artillery shell fragments, so called                             from the 2nd World War, after the inventor of the original shrapnel shell,                             Henry Shrapnel, who devised a shell filled with pellets and explosive powder                             c.1806.\nsick squid - six pounds (£6), from the late 20th                             century joke - see squid.\nsilver - silver coloured coins, typically a handful or                             piggy-bankful of different ones - i.e., a mixture of 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p.                             Commonly used in speech as 'some silver' or 'any silver', for example: \"Have                             you got any silver for the car-park?\" or What tip shall we leave?\" ... \"Some                             silver will do.\" In fact 'silver' coins are now made of cupro-nickel 75%                             copper, 25% nickel (the 20p being 84% and 16% for some reason). The slang term                             'silver' in relation to monetary value has changed through time, since silver                             coins used to be far more valuable. In fact arguably the modern term 'silver'                             equates in value to 'coppers' of a couple of generations ago. Silver featured                             strongly in the earliest history of                             British money , so it's pleasing that the word still occurs in modern money                             slang. Interestingly also, pre-decimal coins (e.g., shillings, florins,                             sixpences) were minted in virtually solid silver up until 1920, when they were                             reduced to a still impressive 50% silver content. The modern 75% copper 25%                             nickel composition was introduced in 1947. Changes in coin composition                             necessarily have to stay ahead of economic attractions offered by the scrap                             metal trade. It is therefore only a matter of time before modern 'silver'                             copper-based coins have to be made of less valuable metals, upon which provided                             they remain silver coloured I expect only the scrap metal dealers will notice                             the difference.\nsimoleon/samoleon - a                             dollar ($1) - (also simoleons/simloons = money) - other variations                             meaning a dollar are sambolio, simoleum, simolion, and presumably other                             adaptations, first recorded in the US late 1800s, thought possibly (by                             Cassells) to derive from a combination or confusion of the slang words 'simon'                             for a sixpence (below) and 'Napoleon', a French coin worth 20 Francs. To a                             lesser extent and later, probably mid-1900s, simoleon also meant a five dollar                             bill. Simoleon is in more recent times also the currency in the Maxis 'Sims'                             computer games series, and while this has popularised the term, it obviously                             was not the origin, appropriate though it is for the Sims context. (Thanks B                             Jones for raising this and its pre-Sims existence.)\nsimon - sixpence (6d). The sixpenny piece used to be known                             long ago as a 'simon', possibly (ack L Bamford) through reference to the 17th                             century engraver at the Royal Mint, Thomas Simon. There has been speculation                             among etymologists that 'simon' meaning sixpence derives from an old play on                             words which represented biblical text that St Peter \"...lodged with Simon a                             tanner..\" as a description of a banking transaction, although Partridge's                             esteemed dictionary refutes this, at the same time conceding that the slang                             'tanner' for sixpence might have developed or been reinforced by the old joke.                             See 'tanner' below.\nsir isaac - one pound (£1) - used in Hampshire (Southern England) apparently originating from the time when the one pound note                             carried a picture of Sir Isaac Newton. I'd welcome any feedback as to usage of this slang beyond Hampshire,                             (thanks M Ty-Wharton).\nsky/sky diver - five pounds (£5), 20th century cockney                             rhyming slang.\nsmackers/smackeroos - pounds (or dollars) - in recent times                             not usually used in referring to a single £1 or a low amount, instead                             usually a hundred or several hundreds, but probably not several thousands, when                             grand would be preferred. Smackers (1920s) and smackeroos (1940s) are probably                             US extensions of the earlier English slang smack/smacks (1800s) meaning a pound                             note/notes, which Cassells slang dictionary suggests might be derived from the                             notion of smacking notes down onto a table.\nsobs - pounds. Mispronunciation of sovs, short for                             sovereigns. An example of erroneous language becoming real actual language                             through common use. (Thanks to R Maguire for raising this one.)\nsovs - pounds. Short for sovereigns - very old gold and the                             original one pound coins. For example 'Lend us twenty sovs..' Sov is not                             generally used in the singular for one pound. Mispronounced by some as                             'sobs'.\nspondulicks/spondoolicks - money. Pronunciation emphasises                             the long 'doo' sound. Various other spellings, e.g., spondulacks, spondulics.                             Normally refers to notes and a reasonable amount of spending money. The                             spondulicks slang can be traced back to the mid-1800s in England (source:                             Cassells), but is almost certainly much older. Spondoolicks is possibly from                             Greek, according to Cassells - from spondulox, a type of shell used for early                             money. Cassells also suggests possible connection with 'spondylo-' referring to                             spine or vertebrae, based on the similarity between a stack of coins and a                             spine, which is referenced in etymologist Michael Quinion's corespondence with                             a Doug Wilson, which cites the reference to piled coins (and thereby perhaps                             the link to sponylo/spine) thus: \"Spondulics - coin piled for counting...\" from                             the 1867 book A Manual of the Art of Prose Composition: For the Use of Colleges                             and Schools, by John Mitchell Bonnell. (Thanks R Maguire for prompting more                             detail for this one.)\nsprazi/sprazzy - sixpence (6d). A variation of sprat, see                             below.\nsprat/spratt - sixpence (6d). From the 1800s, by association                             with the small fish.\nsquid - a pound (£1). Not normally pluralised, still                             expressed as 'squid', not squids, e.g., 'Fifty squid'. The most likely origin                             of this slang expression is from the joke (circa 1960-70s) about a shark who                             meets his friend the whale one day, and says, \"I'm glad I bumped into you -                             here's that sick squid I owe you..\"\nstiver/stuiver/stuyver - an old penny (1d). Stiver also                             earlier referred to any low value coin. Stiver was used in English slang from                             the mid 1700s through to the 1900s, and was derived from the Dutch Stiver coin                             issued by the East India Company in the Cape (of South Africa), which was the                             lowest East India Co monetary unit. There were twenty Stivers to the East India                             Co florin or gulden, which was then equal to just over an English old penny                             (1d). (source Cassells)\nstrike - a sovereign (early 1700s) and later, a pound, based                             on the coin minting process which is called 'striking' a coin, so called                             because of the stamping process used in making coins.\nswy/swi - two shillings (especially florin coin). From the                             1920s, derived from the German swei, an English pronunciation of the German                             word (swy, instead of svy), conceivably adopted into English slang following                             exposure of soldiers to the German language in World War One. Also used in                             Australia. Also refers generally to the number two. (Thanks S Johnson)\ntanner - sixpence (6d). The                             slang word 'tanner' meaning sixpence dates from the early 1800s and is derived                             most probably from Romany gypsy 'tawno' meaning small one, and Italian 'danaro'                             meaning small change. The 'tanner' slang was later reinforced (Ack L Bamford)                             via jocular reference to a biblical extract about St Peter lodging with Simon,                             a tanner of hides (hence the Tanner surname, which referred to the job of                             converting animal skin into leather by soaking it in tannic acid, derived from                             bark, or gall or bile from animals). The biblical text (from Acts chapter 10                             verse 6) is: \"He (Peter) lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the                             sea side..\", which was construed by jokers as banking transaction instead of a                             reference to overnight accommodation. Below in more money history Nick Ratnieks suggests the                             tanner was named after a Master of the Mint of that name. A further suggestion                             (ack S Kopec) refers to sixpence being connected with pricing in the leather                             trade. I have no other evidence of this and if anyone has any more detail                             relating to the derivation of the tanner please send                             it . An obscure point of nostalgic trivia about the tanner is (thanks J                             Veitch) a rhyme, from around the mid-1900s, sung to the tune of Rule Britannia:                             \"Rule Brittania, two tanners make a bob, three make eighteen pence and four two                             bob\" I am informed also since mentioning this here (thanks to the lady                             from London) who recalls her father signing the rhyme in the 1950s, in which                             the words 'one-and-sixpence' were used instead of 'eighteen pence'. If you                             remember more please tell me . Additionally,                             coincidentally or perhaps influentially, (thanks R Andrews) apparently British                             people in colonial India (broadly from about 1850 until India's independence in                             1947) referred to a half rupee (eight annas) coin as 'eightanna', which                             obviously sounds just like 'a tanner'. The eight anna coin is said to have                             resembled the British sixpence of the time (which would have looked much like a                             pre-decimalisation sixpence). Britain issued India's coins during colonial rule                             and so some connection here is plausible. Incidentally, at the end of the 1800s                             the Indian silver rupee equated to one shilling and fourpence in British                             currency, or fifteen rupees to one pound sterling. The anna was effectively                             discontinued when India decimalised its currency in 1957.\ntenner - ten pounds (£10).\nten bob bit - fifty pence piece (50p) - a somewhat rare and                             odd example of old money slang (both 'ten bob', and 'bit') adapting and                             persisting into modern times. The 50p coin was issued in 1967 to replace the                             10/- note (ten shillings, or 'ten-bob note') at which the 10/- note was                             withdrawn. (This is the odd aspect..) The 1967 issue of the 50p coin was four                             years before decimalisation, and therefore also four years before the change of                             the currency/terminology to 'new pence'. So from 1967-71 the 50p coin was                             officially called ten shillings, hence 'ten-bob bit'. Prior to this there had                             never been a ten shilling coin, and we might wonder if the term 'ten-bob bit'                             would ever have emerged if the 50p coin had not been issued under such oddly                             premature circumstances. Of course the 'ten shilling coin' was officially                             renamed the '50p coin' when decimalisation happened in 1971, but happily the                             'ten-bob bit' slang persisted and is still heard very occasionally today.                             Incidentally this pre-decimal issue of 'new pence' coins acting as 'old pence'                             money also applied to shillings (1/-) and florins (2/-)... From 1967 shillings                             were minted as 5p coins, and two-shillings as 10p coins, however since                             same-sized pre-decimalisation equivalent shilling and two-shilling coins                             already existed there was not a marked clash of nomenclature, and or new slang,                             as arose for the 'ten-bob bit. Separately the word 'bit' has long been slang                             for different forms of money, usually small coins, and notably in predecimal                             currency applied also to the 'thruppeny bit' and 'two-bob bit', but generally                             not to other coinage of the times. See 'bit'. (Thanks to T Casey for helping                             clarify this.)\ntester/teaster/teston/testone/testoon -                             sixpence (6d) - from the late 1500s up to the 1920s. Rare since then. A teston                             was originally a French silver coin, struck at Milan by (for) the Duke of                             Milan, Galeazzo Mario (Maria) Sforza (1468-76), bearing his head. Teston is                             derived from Latin testa, meaning head. Later (mid-1500s) the word teston was                             applied to other Italian and French coinage. In England the name teston (also                             testoon*) was first used for the Henry VII (reigned 1485-1509) shilling, the                             first English coin to carry a true portrait. The term continued for equivalent                             coins of Henry VII and Edward VI, during which time the coin reduced in value                             from twelve pence to six pence and lower (values were less fixed then than                             now). By the late 1500s the distorted slang term tester (alongside variations                             above) had developed, coinciding with the coin's depreciation and debasing of                             the metal, so that tester became specific slang for a sixpennny piece.                             Interestingly the slang word tester was also later adopted (notably in                             Australian slang, mid-1800s to 1940s) to mean twenty-five strokes of the lash.                             Other coin slang words were similarly adopted (mid 1800s) equating to different                             levels of punishment, associated with maritime service, deportation and prison,                             such as bob (a shilling - 50 strokes), bull (five shillings - 75 strokes),                             canary (a guinea or sovereign - 100 strokes). The number of strokes did not                             match the coin denominations, but there is an obvious rising scale of violence                             correlation between relative values. The word tester (just sixpence, and just                             25 strokes) no doubt appealed because of its additional ironic meaning in this                             context. It is tempting to imagine a connection between this sense of                             entry-level physical punishment and the 1900s slang 'a sixpenny one' meaning a                             single punch in the face or around the ear, often following a warning to                             dispense such retribution.

Thanks J                             Dodgson.)\n* The 'oon' ending of testoon was a common suffix for French                             words adapted into English, such as balloon, buffoon, spitoon, dragoon,                             cartoon.\nthick'un/thick one - a crown (5/-) or a sovereign, from the                             mid 1800s.\nthree ha'pence/three haypence - 1½d (one and a half                             old pennies) - this lovely expression (thanks Dean) did not survive                             decimalisation, despite there being new decimal half-pence coins. In fact the                             term was obsolete before 1971 decimalisation when the old ha'penny (½d)                             was removed from the currency in 1969. Alternatively three ha'pence was called                             and written 'a penny-ha'penny' or 'a penny-haypenny', or by Londoners 'a                             penny-aypny' (thanks V).\nthrupence/threpence/thrupenny                             bit/thrupny bit - the pre-decimalization threepenny coin (3d), or                             before that (1937) referred to the silver threepenny coin. These spellings are                             the most popular slang/shortenings, most recently referring to the 'three-penny                             bit', less commonly called 'threepenny piece', the lovely nickel-brass (brass                             coloured) twelve-sided three-penny coin, introduced in 1937 to replace the                             preceding smaller silver 'threppence' or 'thrupny piece/bit' or 'joey'                             initially when the thrupny bit was first minted in 1937, and fully in 1945 when                             the silver threepence was withdrawn. See joey for detail                             about the silver thrupence, was also called a thrupny bit, and for a lot longer                             than the brass version, although not many would remember those times. The brass                             thrupny bit was withdrawn just prior to decimalization in 1971. See also the                             origins and other coin uses of the word bit - the word was used for other coins long                             ago. You will see other variations of spellings such as threp'ny, thrup'ny,                             thruppence, threpny, etc. Where the version ends with 'pny' (shortening of                             penny) it would always be followed by the 'bit' suffix. (Thanks I Harrison for                             suggesting this obvious omission.)\ntickey/ticky/tickie/tiki/tikki/tikkie - ticky or tickey was                             an old pre-decimal British silver threepenny piece (3d, equating loosely to                             1¼p). The tickey slang was in use in 1950s UK (in Birmingham for                             example, thanks M Bramich), although the slang is more popular in South Africa,                             from which the British usage seems derived. In South Africa the various                             spellings refer to a SA threepenny piece, and now the equivalent SA                             post-decimalisation 2½ cents coin. South African tickey and variations -                             also meaning 'small' - are first recorded in the 19th century from uncertain                             roots (according to Partridge and Cassells) - take your pick: African distorted                             interpretation of 'ticket' or 'threepenny'; from Romany tikeno and tikno                             (meaning small); from Dutch stukje (meaning a little bit); from Hindustani taka                             (a stamped silver coin); and/or from early Portuguese 'pataca' and French                             'patac' (meaning what?.. Partridge doesn't say). Additionally (thanks K Gibbs)                             apparently the word 'tickey' has specific origins in the SA Cape Malay                             community, said to derive from early Malaccan slaves who brought with them a                             charm called a 'Tickey'. Furthermore (thanks R Rickett) in 1960-70s South                             Africa the extra inner right front 'watch' or 'fob' pocket on a pair of jeans,                             popularized by Levi, was called a 'ticky pocket', being where pocket money was                             kept. Let me know if you can add any further                             clarity to the history of ticky, tickey, etc.\ntin - first recorded (says Cassells) as slang for money in                             the UK, mainly for silver coinage, in the mid 1800s, although the term seems to                             have become largely obscure by the 1960s. In the US meanwhile, tin came to mean                             a trifling or small amount of money by about 1920. (Thanks C Nethercroft)\ntom/tom mix - six pounds (£6), 20th century cockney                             rhyming slang, (Tom Mix = six). Tom Mix was a famous cowboy film star from                             1910-1940. Tom Mix initially meant the number six (and also fix, as in                             difficult situation or state of affairs), and extended later in the 1900s to                             mean six pounds.\nton - commonly one hundred pounds (£100). Not generally                             pluralised. From the fact that a ton is a measurement of 100 cubic feet of                             capacity (for storage, loading, etc). In the same way a ton is also slang for                             100 runs in cricket, or a speed of 100 miles per hour. Logically 'half a ton'                             is slang for £50.\ntony benn - ten pounds (£10), or a ten pound note -                             cockney rhyming slang derived from the Labour MP and government minister                             Anthony Wedgwood Benn, popularly known as Tony Benn. Tony Benn (born 1925)                             served in the Wilson and Callaghan governments of the 1960s and 70s, and as an                             MP from 1950-2001, after which he remains (at time of writing this, Feb 2008) a                             hugely significant figure in socialist ideals and politics, and a very wise and                             impressive man.\ntosheroon/tusheroon/tosh/tush/tusseroon - half-a-crown (2/6)                             from the mid-1900s, and rarely also slang for a crown (5/-), most likely based                             in some way on madza caroon (' lingua franca ' from mezzo crown), perhaps because of the rhyming, or some lost                             cockney rhyming rationale.\ntray/trey - three pounds, and earlier threpence (thruppeny                             bit, 3d), ultimately from the Latin tres meaning three, and especially from the                             use of tray and trey for the number three in cards and dice games.\ntwo and a kick - half a crown (2/6), from the early 1700s,                             based on the basic (not cockney) rhyming with 'two and six'.\nwad - money. Usually meaning a large amount of spending money                             held by a person when out enjoying themselves. London slang from the 1980s,                             derived simply from the allusion to a thick wad of banknotes. Popularity of                             this slang word was increased by comedian Harry Enfield.\nwampum - money - from native American Indian language                             referring to polished shells or beads currency.\nwedge - nowadays 'a wedge' a pay-packet amount of money,                             although the expression is apparently from a very long time ago when coins were                             actually cut into wedge-shaped pieces to create smaller money units.\nwonga - money. Less common variations on the same theme:                             wamba, wanga, or womba. Modern London slang. Probably from Romany gypsy 'wanga'                             meaning coal. The large Australian 'wonga' pigeon is almost certainly                             unrelated...\nyard - a thousand million (pounds sterling, dollars or                             euros). (Thanks P Lindsey) Yard here is a slang shortening of milliard, an old                             (1700s) English word for a thousand million (1,000,000,000), originally from                             French, from mille, thousand. Yard may be pluralized, for example 2 yards, or                             two yards = 2,000,000,000. In UK/US/Arab numbering and money terminology the                             word milliard has been replaced by billion, but elsewhere in the world milliard                             is still used, and a billion refers to a million millions, not a thousand                             millions. This perhaps explains why the slang 'yard' has grown in popularity                             among people referring to such big sums, so as to clarify quickly a very large                             number which might otherwise easily be confused in international                             communications. In the world of finance obviously confusion on such a vast                             scale would not be helpful. See the metric                             prefixes page for fuller explanations of big number words, and                             decimals/fractions, and the differences between UK/US 'short scale' numbers,                             compared with European 'long scale' numbers; there are examples of even bigger                             numbers and different words besides milliard/billion. Apart from the modern                             slang meaning of yard, the word yard separately came into the US slang language                             in or a little before the 1920s to mean either 100 or 1,000 dollars, and in                             certain situations this slang persists, related to the underworld/prison slang                             of a custodial sentence of a hundred years.\nyennep/yenep/yennap/yennop - a penny (1d particularly,                             although also means a decimal penny, 1p). Yennep is backslang. Backslang                             evolved for similar reasons as cockney rhyming slang, i.e., to enable private                             or secret conversation among a particular community, which in the case of                             backslang is generally thought initially to have been street and market                             traders, notably butchers and greengrocers. Backslang essentially entails                             reversing the sound of the word, not the strict spelling, as you can see from                             the yennep example. Yennep backslang seems first to have appeared along with                             the general use of backslang in certain communities in the 1800s.\nyennaps/yennups - money. Originated in the 1800s from the                             backslang for penny. See yennep.\nzac/zak/zack/sac - sixpence (6d) - Australian and New Zealand                             slang from the late 1800s for a sixpence, extending more generally to refer to                             money, and especially a small sum of money or a 5 cents coin. The zak slang                             meaning for money is also used in South Africa. Possibly derived from Scottish                             pronunciation and slang 'saxpence'. Like a few other money slang terms zac/zack                             also refers to a numerical equivalent prison sentence, in this case six months.                             (Thanks S Johnson)\n \nmore old money                         history and references\nHere are some other observations about English money. I'm grateful                             to Nick Ratnieks for providing the opportunity to start this section. Other                             contributions gratefully received.\nFrom Nick Ratnieks, Jun 2007: \"I didn't spot anything on the history                             of the groat which was a nice little 4d silver coin I think minted until the                             1830s but possibly still existing today as Maundy Money which is a section by                             itself [now briefly summarised above, thanks for the prompt].\nYou mention the florin which was an early experiment at going                             decimal as there were 10 to the pound. I seem to remember that the early ones                             left off the latin phrase 'dei gratia' and were known as 'Godless florins' and                             I have a feeling were withdrawn from circulation. For a short period of time in                             the 1880s there was a 'double florin' - 4 bob - my grandmother had one.\nYou mention that the lower denomination coins were copper but they                             were changed to bronze in the great re-coining of 1860 that led to smaller                             coins. There had been the old Matthew Boulton Mint 'Cartwheel Tuppences' made                             using James Watt's steam engines and for the colonies there were even half and                             I believe quarter farthings. And the Gold Noble, a stonking great third of a                             quid 80 pennies or 6/8d.\n[And with reference to the origins of the 'tanner' slang for                             sixpence] ...John Sigesmund Tanner came to England from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in                             1727 and shortly afterwards joined the Royal Mint where he worked for 40 years                             becoming the chief engraver...\nMy brother found an old Daily Mail published on February 26th 1955                             and the price was written as 'three halfpence' which is rather wonderful I                             think! The other thing is retail pricing - I seem to remember up to a certain                             level shillings were used. My Tuf shoes were 49/11d - I think after that sort                             of price or 59/11d they tended to use £'s. Then prices in guineas - one                             of my friends who was a professional guitarist said his first 'decent' guitar                             bought for him by his dad - a Gibson Les Paul Junior was 69 guineas which is of                             course £72 9/-. I think there was an element of 'posh' and as I have seen                             ads for appliances in guineas - the desire to make it seem 'affordable' as well                             was part of the ruse.\"\n(Thanks Nick Ratnieks, who later confirmed that the crazy price of                             the Gibson Les Paul was wrong - it was in fact 68 guineas!)\n \nbritish money, english money, scottish                         money...\nPlease note that Scotland, Northern Ireland and the various islands                             of Britain have produced and continue to produce their own (sometimes very                             different) designs of coins and banknotes, which are legal tender in all of Britain. As such                             these different notes and coins are all British currency (even though not all                             shops and traders everywhere accept them, for reasons of unfamiliarity or a                             heightened sensitivity to the risks of forgeries).\nThis webpage chiefly concerns British currency issued by the Bank of                             England and the Royal Mint, which is legal tender everywhere in Britain, hence                             the use of the term British, because 'English' would actually be incorrect in                             this context, and unhelpfully parochial too.\nArguably a more correct description for certain sections of this                             article would be 'British currency issued by the Bank of England or the Royal                             Mint' but to keep repeating this would become a real bore, so please forgive                             the relatively loose use of the words Britain and British - in most situations                             on this page British equates to the longer phrase above.\nThis is not to dismiss the huge variety of wonderful designs of                             coins and banknotes produced by Scotland and other parts of the British Isles.                             I hope eventually to encompass some of this money and its related details and                             history on this page.\nWith that in mind, I'd be grateful to receive pictures or even                             examples of the real thing, especially high value notes if you have plenty to                             spare..\nSend your pics of interesting                             and/or beautiful banknotes and coins from Scotland, Northern Ireland, the                             Channel Islands, etc., and I'll show them on this page, or even start a new                             section altogether.\nThanks H Camrass for raising this whole issue about British                             terminology and non-English coins and banknotes.\nFor starters, here's a cute                         little 20p piece from Jersey (not actual size...)

The term 'New Penny' was dropped in 1982 on the grounds that after ten years it was no ... Coins of UK - The Change to Decimal Coinage Decimal Coins of the UK - The Change to Decimal Coinage Decimal Coins of the UK - The Change to Decimal Coinage\nThe Change to Decimal Coinage\nPictures of Decimal Coins\nDecimalisation Day\nD-Day was February 15th 1971.  On that day the United Kingdom changed from the centuries old tradition of using 12 pence to the shilling and 20 shillings to the pound to a new decimal 100 new pence to the pound.\nOptions considered\nThere had been much debate as to the best way of implementing the switch.\nAustralia used a dollar valued at ten old shillings, making the new cent equal to 1.2 old pence, a small change in value.\nAn alternative was to go to a pound-mil system, with a mil equal to 0.24 old pence, a latter-day successor to the farthing.\nAnother was to keep the penny and have a new unit at 100 pence (eight shillings and fourpence).\nHowever, in the UK the pound was considered to be particularly important because of the UK's international trading status.  In addition, having a new penny worth 2.4 old pence was less of a problem as inflation had made its purchasing power insignificant.  As a temporary measure a half new penny was introduced, but as will be seen this had a short life.  There was even a pattern quarter penny made in aluminium, but this was not proceeded with.\nIt was realised at the time that the decision was made that the life of the halfpenny would be very short, but it was felt necessary despite the considerable extra cost of having to mint the coin.  Banks never accepted transactions involving an odd halfpenny.\nThe Timetable for the Change\nThe change was made gradually over three years, in a number of stages.\nIn 1968 new shillings and florins were issued as 5 new pence and 10 new pence coins.  The older shillings and florins continued to    circulate long after decimalisation until the size of the coins was reduced.  Theoretically    silver coins from 1816 could still have been found in change, but the active   withdrawal of silver in the years following the change in 1947, followed   by the combination of a dramatic rise in the price of silver with devaluation   in 1967 meant that silver coins rapidly vanished from circulation.\nBlue plastic wallets containing the new 5p and 10p coins dated 1968, along with 1/2p, 1p and 2p   coins dated 1971 were put on sale. These wallets are still very common.\nIn October 1969 the 50 new pence piece replaced the 10 shilling note, which ceased to be legal tender on 22nd November 1970.\nThe old halfpenny was demonetised on 1st August 1969.\nThe half-crown was demonetised on 1st January 1970.\nThe remaining decimal coins became legal tender on 15th February 1971.   Maundy coins (and silver threepenny pieces of Maundy design, i.e. with   a crowned three on the reverse) were revalued as being in new pence at the same time.\nThe changeover was so rapid that the old penny and nickel brass threepence pieces   had been removed from circulation by the end of 1971, although I know   of one shop in the Yorkshire Dales which continued to use the old currency   for a long time on the basis that 'this new-fangled stuff will never catch on'.\nThe old penny and threepence coins ceased to be legal tender on 31st August 1971, just over six months after D-day.  It is no longer possible to exchange them for current coins at a bank.\nLater Developments\nThe sixpence , which was allowed to continue circulating at 2½ new pence, was  eventually withdrawn at the end of June 1980.  I am indebted to Brian Dominic for the following quote from John Glover's book \"London's Underground\":  \"The adoption of decimal currency on 15 February 1971 posed a few problems for London Transport, which had favoured the £ Sterling being halved in value and divided into 100 pence - what today might be termed a '50p pound'. With their extensive use of coin operated machines, the Board took strong exception to the proposed introduction of ½p coins, the lack of any coin between 2p and 5p, and the lack of a close relationship of old values and coins with the new. It was all too difficult for them, and it was indeed at London Transport's behest that the 2½p (sixpence) was retained in the coinage for the time being.\"\nThe term 'New Penny' was dropped in 1982 on the grounds that after ten years it was no longer 'new'.  In that year a new denomination, the 20p coin was introduced.  It has proved very popular, and is one of the most frequently encountered coins in change.\nThe pound coin was first issued in 1983.  Again, there was a little resistance to the change from note to coin, but cessation of production of the pound note rapidly overcame the objections and the coin is now very well established.  The notes were demonetised on 11th March 1988.\nThe half penny coin was last minted for circulation in 1983.   In 1984 the denomination was only issued in Mint and Proof Sets and in December 1984 the  coin was demonetised, as inflation had rendered it an anachronism.\nIn 1985 a new portrait came into use, designed by Raphael David Maklouf, although the portrait on the Maundy coins was unchanged.\nCommemorative two pound coins were first issued in 1986, but although legal tender they rarely circulated (some are appearing in change now that the bimetallic circulating coin has been introduced, but as they are about twice the weight of circulating coins, banks have difficulty handling them).\nCrown sized commemorative coins valued at 25 pence continued to be minted, but after the Royal Wedding issue of 1981 later 'crowns' were valued at five pounds . This is a source of confusion, but the way to be sure is to know that if they are five pound coins they have the value on them.\nIt was intended that a new two pound coin of the same diameter but thinner than  the commemorative versions be introduced in November 1997, but due to technical problems (vending machines rejected them), the introduction was delayed until 1998.  This new coin is bimetallic, being the first such coin to be issued in the UK since the tin farthings and halfpennies of the late 17th century.  It is the subject of an urban legend, in that a rumour is going the rounds that those coins where the queen is wearing a necklace are rare. This is most definitely untrue, but hoarding of these coins means they not often found in change.\nIn 1998 a further new obverse portrait was introduced, designed by Ian Rank-Broadley, which is still in use nearly ten years later.\nIn 2008 a new set of reverse designs has been revealed, which, in the words of the Royal Mint, 'are a contemporary take on traditional heraldry reflecting the nation's rich history'. These designs apply only to the denominations from 1 penny to 1 pound, and I have been told that both the old and the new reverse designs will be put into circulation dated 2008.\nMetal Change\nIn 1992 the metal used for the one penny and two penny coins was changed from bronze to copper coated steel.  The use of a pure copper coating means that the colour of mint coins  is slightly different. Also, as the density of steel is less than bronze and the weight was unchanged, the newer coins are noticeably thicker than the older ones.\nThe versions of these coins issued in the 1992 Mint and Proof sets are said to be bronze - only the circulation issue coins of that date were steel.\nIn 1998 the 2p (and possibly the 1p) temporarily reverted to bronze because of technical problems at the Royal Mint.\nIn 2011 the 5p and 10p coins will change to being made of plated steel as the lower denominations. Perhaps  the 20p and 50p will follow, but the sharper corners of these seven-sided coins may mitigate against this.\nShrinkage\nAs a result of inflation the coins based on the old system, the five pence and ten pence , were increasingly seen as oversized for their value.\nIn 1990 a new smaller version of the 5p coin was introduced, and the old large ones along with the shillings that were still to be found were demonetised at the end of that year.\nThe same technique was used for the 10p coin in 1992, with the old size 10p and florin being demonetised at the end of June 1993.  Frustratingly, the new 10p is similar in size to the old large 5p, and very occasionally you get fooled!\nThe next was the 50p coin , which was reduced in size in 1997.  This also reduced the enormous stock of the larger coins held in banks due to a reduction in demand after the introduction of the pound coin.  A similar problem with the pound coin  now that the circulating two pound coin has come into use did occur only to the extent that new one pound coins were not issued for circulation dated 1998 and 1999.\nA new series of 'normal' non-commemorative designs were released in 2008 for all except  the two pound coin.  As these were not announced until well into the year, coins up to one pound dated 2008 come in both the original 1968/1971 designs and the new 2008 design. The 2008 50p with Britannia reverse had a very low mintage - I have only seen one in circulation.\nStarting in 2009, an enormous variety of coins of various denominations are being issued in connection with the 2012 Olympics in London.\nThe Future\nThe penny and twopence coins have become ever more insignificant in value in everyday transactions. However, these two denominations comprise the largest bulk of new coins minted at the Royal Mint, no less than 71% in 1998-99.  The reason for this is simple - they are hoarded because of their low value, with pockets and purses being emptied of these relatively heavy coins each day.\nAustralia and New Zealand have both abandoned the 1 and 2 cent coins, with no significant effect on either trade or inflation.  Cash transactions are rounded to the nearest 5 cents, while credit card transactions and cheques can still be written for odd cents.  How soon will the UK bow to the inevitable and demonetise the 'coppers'?\nLegal Tender\nThe following applies to England and Wales:\n20p and 50p coins are legal tender up to a total value of 10 pounds.\n5p and 10p coins are legal tender up to a total value of 5 pounds.\n1p and 2p coins are legal tender up to a total of 20 pence.\nTherefore you cannot insist on paying your Income Tax (or other unpopular bill) in 1p coins!\nWhile five pound coins and old monometallic thick two pound coins are technically legal tender, banks do  not accept them. As a result you might find it difficult to find traders willing to accept them.\nI gather that Scotland does not have any legal restriction, other than that payment should be presented in a reasonable manner. Tendering a large sum in pennies might not be considered 'reasonable', but the boundary between reasonable and unreasonable is not defined!\nAcknowledgements\nSee my Coins Index page for acknowledgements\nCSV File of Values\nDownload a CSV file of the values of decimal coins.\nLinks\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nExplain to the class that this would mean that the odds of getting two heads when flipping two coins would be or 1:3. ... a four-letter word on ... 3 Algebra I (Unit ...

In an unusual development for modern coinage and an unheard of development within the Statehood Quarter series, three distinctive die varieties have been reported for the 2004-D Wisconsin Quarter. First reported by collector Bob Ford, of Tucson, AZ, the more unusual varieties have thus far been reported in only the Tucson and San Antonio areas.\n2004-D Wisconsin State Quarter Varieties\nNormal Dies\nScarce\n \nPictured above are the three varieties, each clearly distinguishable by the naked eye. On the left, the ordinary Wisconsin Quarter shows only the large leaf to the left of the corn husk. These coins are very common, available everywhere D-mint quarters circulate, and worth only their face value. The center coin shows distinct markings, resembling an extra leaf, between the large leaf and the block of cheese. Because of the location of these markings, this variety is called \"Extra Leaf Low.\" On the right, the coin also shows a curved marking to the left of the corn husk; this variety is called \"Extra Leaf High.\"\nThese coins are not mere striking errors. Although we may never know exactly how they came about, there is no question that these varieties arose as a result of an accidental or deliberate modification to the two obverse dies. Rick Snow, of Eagle Eye Rare Coins in Tucson, speculates that \"perhaps (the varieties are) a \"hub-through\" where a semi-circular piece of debris gets caught between the blank die and the hub. This would produce an impression in the die which would create a raised element on the coins produced.\" Unexplained, though, is the location of the die modification and the fact that both varieties resemble extra leaves on a corn stalk. According to Snow, \"it may be an extraordinary coincidence or the result of some Mint employee's private artwork.\"\nWhether these new Wisconsin Quarter varieties have arisen as a result of a hubbing error as Mr. Snow speculates, a die gouge as originally reported, or an unauthorized artistic endeavor in Denver, they have caught the attention of the collecting public. As this is written in February 2005, these coins are still quite scarce, with the Extra Leaf Low variety somewhat scarcer than the Extra Leaf High variety, and each scarce variety coin currently brings three figure retail prices. Both PCGS and NGC grade and attribute these coins as individual varieties, and indeed NGC will encapsulate the three varieties together if you have the coins to submit.\nPerhaps the best comparison to these coins is the famed 1937-D Three-Legged Buffalo Nickel, a variety caused by overpolishing of a single die. Originally found only in the Billings, Montana area, this coin has remained rare and popular since its discovery, with circulated pieces selling for prices in the mid three figures. Only time will tell whether the Extra Leaf Wisconsin Quarter varieties will remain scarce or how valuable they will be in the future. For now, they represent a chance to find a scarce coin in your pocket change.\nWestward Journey Nickels\nAfter an uninterrupted run of 65 years, there are changes in the works for the nickel. In 2004 and 2005, special circulating commemoratives known as the Westward Journey Nickel Series were released to commemorate the bicentennial of Lewis and Clark's expedition to explore the Louisiana Purchase and eventually the North American continent. The nickel is a natural choice for this series, as the obverse has long featured Thomas Jefferson, who was President during Lewis and Clark's explorations.\nBy now, chances are good that you will have run across many of the Westward Journey nickels in your change. The two 2004 varieties are known as the \"Peace Medal\" and \"Keelboat\" coins. Both coins' obverses feature the familiar portrait of Thomas Jefferson.\nThe Peace Medal coin, released in early 2004, has a reverse derived from the original Indian Peace Medal given out by Lewis and Clark during their explorations to Native American chiefs. Featuring a pair of clasped hands below a crossed peace pipe and axe, the reverse also bears the legend \"Louisiana Purchase 1803 to commemorate the year this historic purchase was made.\nThe Keelboat coin, released in late 2004, features an image of the keelboat Lewis and Clark used to traverse the rivers of the Louisiana Territory to search for a passage to the Pacific Ocean. Below the boat is the inscription \"Lewis & Clark\".\nThings changed even more with the release of the 2005 coins. Thomas Jefferson remains on the coin's obverse, but in a completely new portrait unlike anything ever seen previously on a US coin. His face, in closeup and facing right, covers most of the left side of the coin, peering out into the distance. The motto \"In God We Trust\" remains on the obverse above the inscription \"Liberty\" in script resembling Jefferson's own handwriting.\nThe first of the 2005 Westward Journey nickels to be released into circulation features the return of one of the most beloved motifs in American numismatics, the Bison. Although the bison last appeared on a circulating coin with the 1938-D nickel, several commemoratives since that time have featured renditions of the beast on one side. Now, the \"American Bison\" nickel combines new renditions of the familiar imagery of the two most recent types of nickels to commemorate the importance of the bison to the many Native American cultures encountered by Lewis and Clark during their journeys.\nOne variety of the 2005-D American Bison nickel is drawing a great deal of attention. Found predominantly in northeastern Texas and nicknamed the \"Speared Bison\", this coin has a prominent vertical line running through the center of the bison. The consensus among experienced collectors is that this line is the result of a die gouge, leaving a raised area where the metal was removed from the die.\nOf course, much like the Extra Leaf Up and Extra Leaf Down Wisconsin Quarters, we are still very early in the life of the coin, so only time will tell whether the coin will remain rare and whether future collectors consider this coin a significant variety or merely a curiosity.\nThe final 2005 nickel shows a view of the Pacific Ocean in Oregon similar to that encountered by Lewis and Clark on November 7, 1805. Captain Clark's journal entry for that date was, \"Ocean in View! O! The joy!\", and this inscription appears on the coin. In commemoration of the bicentennial of this event, the inscription \"Lewis and Clark 1805\" also appears on this reverse.\nIn 2006, Jefferson and Monticello return to the nickel. The design of Monticello to be featured on the reverse is virtually identical to the one used prior to 2004, with the most notable change being the addition of designer Felix Schlag's initials to the reverse at the right base of the building -- in exactly the same location that the mintmark appeared through most of 1938-1964. The obverse, however, has much more in common with the revamped 2005 design than with its predecessor. The legends are in the same location as on the 2005 coin, and the script Liberty has been retained.\nThe date has been moved slightly. But the most noticeable change to the obverse is that Jefferson is now facing forward, at the viewer, from the left side of the coin. Jefferson's revamped image is based on the famous painting by Rembrandt Peale in 1800, just a year before Jefferson assumed the presidency.\nWhile we do not anticipate any further changes to the nickel in the near future, we have not yet come to the end of the changes in our circulating coinage. The Statehood Quarter series will continue through 2008 at least, and a series of new gold-colored dollar coins to feature each president of the United States will commence in 2007. And stay tuned -- Abraham Lincoln's bicentennial is in 2009, so we may even see changes to our venerable cent design!\nCommon Coins [ back to top ]\nBicentennial Coinage\nIn 1975 the Bicentennial Coinage Program was introduced. The Quarter, Half Dollar, and Dollar were all changed to include the dual date 1776-1976 and the reverse designs were also changed. These coins were struck in 1975 and 1976 which explains why no 1975 dated Quarters, Halves, or Dollars exist.\nThese coins are all very common, with hundreds of millions of each piece struck. With this in mind it is safe to say that you can spend your bicentennial coinage.\nWheat Cents\nThe term Wheat Cent refers to the design used on the reverse of the Lincoln Cent from 1909-1958. Most Wheat cents are very common, and were produced by the millions and even billions. Currently, common date wheat cents carry a very small premium, in fact only a few cents to a few dollars each, depending on condition and year. Be on the lookout for the 1909-S, 1909-S V.D.B. (The designers initials that appear at the bottom of the reverse), 1914-D, 1931-S, and the 1922-D with no mintmark below the date. These four dates carry a nice premium if you have one. Wheat cents may be a good start to a youngster's collection.\nBuffalo Nickels (No Date)\nDue to the design elements on the Buffalo Nickel, the date wore off of the coin very quickly. A significant factor in a coin's value is the date, mintmark, and condition. A dateless buffalo is not only low in condition, but also lacks a date by which to value it. Buffalo Nickels without a date are not in demand from collectors at all, but have some use as jewelry. With this in mind dateless Buffalo Nickels only retail for between $.10 and $.25 each.\nStanding Liberty Quarters (No Date)\nSimilar to the Buffalo Nickel, the Standing Liberty Quarter minted from 1916-1924 bore its date in a location where it would wear off very quickly. With this in mind dateless Standing Quarters only retail for their silver content, roughly to $4-6 depending on the price of silver.\nEisenhower Dollars\nThe Eisenhower Dollar is made from Copper Nickel clad. These coins have a very small premium over face value, and are fun to spend for a dollar.\nIndian Cents\nMany Indian Head Cents, particularly those made 1880 and later, are quite common, retailing for between $0.50 and $30+, depending on condition.\nKennedy Half Dollars\nKennedy half dollars were first produced in 1964. Half dollars that bear the 1964 date are 90% silver, and carry a numismatic premium based on the current price of silver. In 1965 the amount of silver used in the production of Kennedy halves was decreased to 40%, and this specification was used until 1970. Kennedy halves dated 1971 and later contain no silver and do not command a numismatic premium. In order to evaluate the current value of your Kennedy half dollars, multiply the current market price for silver by 0.36169 for 1964 issues, and by 0.1479 for all issues 1965 to 1970.\nMorgan and Peace Dollars\nMost Morgan (1878-1921) and Peace (1921-1935) Silver Dollars are very common, and were produced by the millions. Currently, common date Morgan and Peace dollars retail for between $25 and $35+ each, depending on the condition, year, and mint mark. The mintmark is a small letter below the wreath's bow on the reverse of the Morgan dollar and beside the eagle on the Peace dollar. Among the mintmarks you will find on Morgan dollars will be a CC for Carson City, O for New Orleans, S for San Francisco, and D for Denver. No Philadelphia issues carry a mintmark. Peace dollars were produced only in Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco.\nBe on the lookout for the 1889-CC, 1893-S, 1894, and 1895. These four dates carry a nice premiums in all grades if you have one. Certain other dates will also carry premiums in any grade, such as any dollar dated 1893 or 1895 regardless of mint, 1903-O, and any dollar with a CC mintmark. 1921 and 1928 Peace Dollars with no mintmark also bring premiums in any grade.\nSilver Coins 1964 and Earlier\nDimes, Quarters and Halves dating 1964 and earlier contain 90% silver. The vast majority of circulated coins that date from the mid 1930's to 1964 are bought and sold as bullion. In circulated condition, these coins trade for roughly the value of the silver they contain, about twenty times their face value in early 2011.\nSteel Cents\nIn 1943, the production of our One Cent coin went through a major change. War efforts that year required copper and its availability was limited. It was decided to change the content from copper to steel coated with zinc for the first run of the new 1943 cents. In 1944, the need for copper was reduced, and the production of the copper cent resumed.\nOver one billion 1943 steel cents were produced at the Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco mints, making this a very common coin. However, many people found the new \"look\" fascinating and saved, rather than spent, the new steel cent. Today, their value ranges from about 5 cents up to about 35 cents in circulated condition. Uncirculated specimens (showing no trace of wear or handling) can bring up to about $10 in high grades.\nAn extremely limited number of 1943 cents were inadvertently struck on copper planchets, left in the machinery from the previous year. Very few escaped the mint unnoticed, and these are considered very desirable to collectors. Auction histories indicate the value range of an authentic 1943 copper cent to be from around $5,000 to $70,000, depending on the mint and condition. However, copper-plated forgeries abound. The primary test for these is to use a magnet. The common steel & zinc pieces (and the 1943 copper-plated fakes, as well as authentic cents from other years) will stick to the magnet. The rare copper issues will not.\nTRVST Coins (Peace Dollars)\nIn 1921 the US Mint released the Peace Dollar. The designer Anthony D'Francisci inscribed the coin with the words IN GOD WE TRVST. This was not a misprint or error, but a return to Roman style letters. The V was used until the letter U was introduced some time later. The word TRVST is evident on all Peace Dollars dated 1921 to 1935. The Standing Liberty Quarter, minted between 1916 and 1930, also used the Roman style of lettering.\nWar Nickels\nNickels with a large mintmark above Monticello's dome are commonly referred to as War Nickels. During W.W.II, nickel was needed for war production, so the mint changed the composition of the 5 cent piece. The new composition reduced the amount of nickel and copper in the piece and replaced it with Silver and Manganese. Coinage laws require that a design change be implemented whenever a change in metallic content is made to a piece of circulating coinage. The change used for this specific coin was the added mintmark above Monticello on the reverse. A prominent P, D, or S is visible on all the War Nickels dated 1942 to 1945.\nWell over 500 million of these pieces were produced between 1942 and 1945, making them quite common. However, their silver content makes them worth more than their face value. Circulated War Nickels retail for the price of the silver they contain, roughly 25 to 50 cents each.\nCommonly Reproduced Coins [ back to top ]\n1799 Silver Dollar\nMany 1799 Silver Dollars are replicas, particularly if they come out of Asia. Authentic pieces retail for between $250 and $3,000, depending on condition. Replicas do not have a numismatic premium.\n1804 Silver Dollar\nWhile the 1804 Silver Dollar is perhaps the most famous rarity in American numismatics, the vast majority of those we encounter are replicas. Thousands of 1804 dollar replicas have been produced in the orient, and discovering a new authentic specimen is highly unlikely.\nAuthentic 1804 silver dollars weighs approximately 26 grams, while most replicas contain no silver and weigh approximately 19 to 20 grams. In addition to the weight, a seam on the edge of the coin is also an indication that the coin is a replica. The coin must have a lettered edge; if it has a reeded edge similar to today's dimes and quarters, it is a replica.\nReplicas of rare coins have no numismatic value.\nTerritorial Gold\nDuring the days of our nation's infancy, there were times when gold coinage needed to be struck privately in order to meet the needs of commerce. This territorial gold coinage in denominations of $5 to $50 was struck not only in California, but in Colorado, Utah, and even North Carolina and Georgia. Authentic pieces are quite collectible and sometimes quite rare.\nUnfortunately, there are also quite a number of common replicas of Territorial Gold coins. Some of the coins that are found far more often as replicas than as the real thing are Baldwin & Co. coins dated 1850 and 1851, and coins from the Cincinnati Mining and Tracing Co. (an engraving error -- authentic pieces have the correct company name Cincinnati Mining and Trading Co.)\nTake a look at your coin. If the coin you have is struck in anything other than gold, it is a replica. If copper or another base metal peeks out from underneath gold plating, the coin is a replica. If the edge of the coin appears to have a seam, then the piece is a replica. Replicas have no numismatic value.\nCalifornia Fractional Gold\nIn addition to high denomination coinage, private mints in California also made small gold coins in the quarter, half dollar, and dollar denominations, between 1852 and 1882. These tiny pieces, minted in both round and octagonal shapes, are quite collectible and authentic pieces can be worth between $50 and $500, depending on variety and condition. Unfortunately, there are also quite a number of replicas in existence. Any California Fractional gold piece that includes a bear in the design is a replica, and is worth only the value of the gold it contains, usually only a few dollars because of the coins' small sizes and low quality gold.\nColonial Coins\nMany US Colonial coins are far more common as replicas than authentic coins. 1776 Continental Currency Dollars, William Moulton coppers, Oak and Pine Tree coinage, Bar coppers, and \"Janus\" coppers are just a few of the coins commonly found as replicas. As always, look for the telltale seam on the edge of the coin, which would indicate that the coin is a replica and has no numismatic value.\n1913 Liberty Nickel\nA total of five 1913 Liberty Nickels were struck. The whereabouts of all five are known. However, there are numerous replicas and coins that have been altered to show a 1913 date. Look at the date under magnification. You may notice that the 19 in the date are not consistent with either the second 1 or the 3. This is evidence that the date was altered from a 1903 or a 1910 dated nickel. You may also want to look around the date. When dates are altered they often feature fine scratches right around the date. An altered coin has no numismatic value.\nError Coins [ back to top ]\nErrors (General)\nA number of errors can occur in the minting process, so many they are too numerous to list. To find a list of the types of errors that can occur in the minting process, we recommend a book called The Error Coin Encyclopedia by Arnold Margolis.\nPlanchets (Blanks)\nBefore coins are struck they are only metal discs. It is not uncommon for a planchet to escape the mint. Most blank planchets are worth $1 and $4, depending on condition.\nGrease Struck Through\nOccasionally, coins will be struck with some feature missing, generally due to grease or some other foreign object between the die and planchet. When a foreign object rests on the die, the detail in that area of the coin becomes filled and does not show up on the coin. This type of error is very common and commands only a slight premium.\nOff-Center\nOff center errors are valued based on a couple different factors. The amount of design still visible, along with the presence of a full date, are the first two concerns. Coins with all four digits readable are valued more than specimens with the date missing. The more off center a strike, generally the more valuable the piece. Also the age of the coin and whether or not it is a key date will have an effect on the error coin. Currently most common off center coins retail for between $1 and $10+.\nUnplated Cents\nCents dated 1982 and later are all struck in a combination of copper and zinc. In order to keep the copper appearance, a sheet of zinc is plated with copper and the planchets are then struck out of the sheets. The result is a \"copper\" looking coin. In some cases the sheet of metal is not plated with nickel and the coins produced from that sheet appear to be grey or silver. This is a common error that currently retails for between $1 and $10, depending on condition and type. This can occur in another fashion as well. There are acids that will remove layers of metal leaving the zinc insides exposed. Coins that have been tampered with in this fashion have no numismatic value.\nUnplated Clad Coins\nDimes, quarters and half dollars are all struck in a combination of copper and nickel. In order to keep the silver appearance, a sheet of copper is plated with nickel and the planchets are then struck out of the sheets. The result is a \"silver\" looking coin. In some cases the sheet of metal is not plated with nickel and the coins produced from that sheet appear to be copper. This is a common error that currently retails for between $5 and $20, depending on condition and type.\nTokens and Medals [ back to top ]\nPresidential Medals\nA number of medallic coins were produced to commemorate the terms of the presidents. There are an unrecorded number of types that were sold in sets and individually, ranging from the Shell Presidential coins of the late 1960s to official inaugural medals. Most presidential medals retail for between 50 cents and $10+ depending on type, condition, and metallic content.\nHard Times Tokens\nIn both America and Canada during the 1830's and 1840's, economic hardships forced a number of banks and individuals to strike coins to make up for a lack of regular circulating coinage. The American tokens are commonly referred to as Hard Times Tokens, and might retail for roughly $10-$30, depending on condition. Canadian pieces are much more common and retail for between $0.50 and $15, depending on condition. Cleaned and damaged pieces are worth significantly less.\nCivil War Tokens\nCivil War Tokens, often made to resemble regular US cents, are quite common. Tokens such as these were produced by individuals and companies to make up for the shortage of coins in circulation. Most tokens carried political slogans or advertisements. There are many different types, most of which are worth between $5 and $20 each.\nStore Tokens\nMany different merchants produced these tokens to offer as change, or for use in exchanging merchandise. Thousands of different stores produced them, and unless they are from a very well known store, they are worth little more than $1 to $15, depending on type and condition.\nTax Tokens\nA number states have issued sales tax tokens. Many of these are quite common, and unfortunately, the large number produced combined with a lack of demand for the pieces have driven prices down. Most sales tax tokens are worth between $0.10 and $5 depending on type and condition.\n\"1789\" Treasury Medal\nThis cent-sized piecee is a medal produced for Mint sets released by the U.S. Mint. These medals are included in the sets, but do not command a premium by themselves. The date 1789 is not the date of issue or minting, rather the date of the establishment of the U.S. Treasury.\nSilver Rounds\nSilver rounds resemble silver dollars, but are medals produced by private mints as an easy and affordable way to own silver. Their artwork often made them more appealing, and some may commemorate special events such as Christmas. Thousands of different silver rounds have been produced, and are not widely collected other than for their silver content. Most contain exactly one ounce of silver and are worth only the value of the silver they contain.\nElongated Cents\nFor over 100 years, entrepreneurs have attended special events with machines that roll images onto all sizes of coins. Cents are obviously the most common elongated coins because of their minimal value. Thousands of these pieces have been produced to commemorate hundreds of events. Machines to elongate cents are common in any areas that are likely to attract tourists. Most elongated cents retail for under a dollar.\nWorld Coins [ back to top ]\nWorld Coins (General)\nA complete list of regular issue Foreign Coins dated 1901 to date and their retail values is available in the Standard Catalog of World Coins by Krause Publications. These books are usually available at large bookstores and public libraries. Editions for coins struck in the 17th through 19th centuries are also available.\nMexican 8 Reales Piece\nOne relatively common, but significant coin, is the Mexican 8 Reales piece. It is a silver coin, roughly the size of a silver dollar, minted from 1733-1821. The coin changed designs several times during production, but it most commonly depicted the reigning Spanish monarch on the obverse, and the Spanish coat of arms on the reverse, with pillars on either side. The scroll that winds around these pillars gave rise to our current dollar sign '$'. This coin is also known as a Pillar Dollar or a Piece of Eight. Eight reales pieces were often cut into 8 pieces called bits. When our dollar was introduced, two bits would have been equivalent to $.25. This is what gave rise to the saying \"two bits\" when used in reference to a quarter. The coins were so popular around the world and so widely accepted, that they were even legal tender in the US until 1857. These coins are quite common, and currently retail for between $20 and $300, depending on condition and type. Pillar dollars were also minted in Guatemala, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. Their origin can be determined by the coin's mintmark\nMAROC\nIf you have a coin dated in the 1300s and it says \"Maroc\" or \"Empire Cherifien\", it is not an old coin. It comes from Morocco, and is probably decorated in a geometric pattern, such as a five pointed star inside a six-pointed star. Like much of the Arab world, Morocco uses the Hejira calendar, a lunar calendar with dates roughly 580 years different from our own. Unusually, however, many of their coins have Hejira dates expressed in numbers that we are able to read. Many Moroccan coins carry dates in the 1300s, and most of these are quite common, with very little value.\n1965 British Churchill Commemorative\nThe 1965 British Churchill commemorative crown is very common, with millions produced. Currently these pieces retail for between $0.50 and $2, depending on condition. Another very common British commemorative piece is the Charles and Diana crown, minted in 1981; it is valued in roughly the same range.\n1915 Austrian 4 ducat\nA commonly encountered gold coin is the modern restrike of a 1915 Austrian 4 ducat piece. All restrikes are dated 1915, have the obverse inscription FRANC.IOS.I.D.G.AUSTRIAE IMPERATOR around a picture of Emperor Franz Joseph, along with a double-headed eagle on the reverse. These coins were in production for decades. Currently these pieces retail for a slight premium over their gold content (0.4432 oz) or about $200-$300, depending on the price of gold.\n1780 Maria Theresa Thaler\nA very common silver coin is a modern restrike of an 18th century Austrian Thaler, known as the Maria Theresa Thaler. All restrikes bear the date 1780 on the reverse and the inscription R.IMP.HU.BO.REG M.THERESIA.D.G surrounding a portrait of Empress Maria Theresa on the obverse. These coins have literally been in production for centuries. Currently these pieces retail for a slight premium over their silver content or about $7-$8.\nMarshall Island Coins\nCurrently Marshall Islands coins are valued at or below their face value when bought and sold in the US coin market. The basis for their currency is the US dollar. This was only based on the US dollar and is not redeemable in the US. The coins are rarely redeemable at face value even on the islands. These coins were intended for collectors, not for widespread use as currency.\nOther Material [ back to top ]\nGold-plated Coins\nGold plated coins are not mint made. Most of the gold plated coins are common date coins. Unfortunately gold plated coins have no numismatic value.\nLincoln/Kennedy Cent\nThe coin you have is a gimmick coin. A company in the 70's stamped items such as the likeness of Kennedy, cigars, word bubbles, and other comedic devices into the right field of Lincoln Cents. This company charged as much as $3.95 for each coin even though today they retail for far less than $1.\nTwo-Headed Coins\nTwo-headed or two-tailed coins are \"Trick\" coins used by magicians. They are manufactured in 2 ways; one is by shaving two separate coins off (Both faces or both tails) and bonding them together; the second method and most used is machining the interior of one coin out (Leaving the edge) and shaving a small portion of another coin on one face and the edge. The smaller piece is then inserted into the hollowed-out piece and bonded together.\nA basic explanation of the minting process illustrates the impossibility of such an error. Every coin is struck by a hammer die (the die that moves during striking) and anvil die (stationary). When a new design is implemented, each side of the coin is assigned a hammer position or anvil position, according to the simplicity of the design. The anvil die is always subject to much more pressure and thus generally carries the simpler design.\nHammer and anvil dies are very different in size and can not be interchanged. The hammer dies is small and round at the bottom, while the anvil die is square, and quite large. The anvil die will not fit into the hammer die position of the coin press or vice versa. Simply put, a large square peg will not fit into a small round hole.\nIf you have a two-headed coin, try this test. First, take a normal coin of the same denomination, balance it at the end of your finger, and strike it with another coin. You will hear a metallic ring. Now, take the two-headed coin and do the same thing. You will hear a dull thud. This indicates that the coin is two pieces, bonded together.\nMule (Cent/Dime)\nCoins with the dime and cent combination that are not uniform in color are \"Trick\" coins used by magicians. They are manufactured in 2 ways; one is by shaving two separate coins off (Both faces, both tails, or dual denomination) and bonding them together; the second method and most used is machining the interior of one coin out (Leaving the edge) and shaving a small portion of another coin on one face and the edge. The smaller piece is then inserted into the hollowed-out piece and bonded together.\nThe recent discovery of a coin struck on a cent planchet with a cent obverse and dime reverse has been confirmed. The coin is dated 1999 and has the appearance of a cent.\nCoin Questions [ back to top ]\nAuthentication\nThere are a number of factors to consider when authenticating a coin. Usually, there are several tests the coin must pass. If the coin fails any one of these tests, it is not authentic.\nFirst, look to see if the coin was struck in the right metal. If the coin is struck in a base metal and should be silver or gold, it is a replica or counterfeit. You may also want to check the rim of the coin. If there appears to be a seam, the coin is an electroplated replica. Weight is often the best giveaway. Most coins have specific weights, and if the coin does not match that weight, it is most likely a replica. If the coin has the wrong kind of edge, such as a reeded edge when the edge should be lettered, it is not authentic.\nAuthenticity is determined differently for every coin. If you have a potentially valuable coin and are not sure of its authenticity, the best thing to do is to show it to an expert. Coins graded and encapsulated in third party holders by respected companies such as PCGS and NGC have been authenticated; the authentication is part of the grading process.\n1982 Lincoln Cent: zinc or copper?\nThe best way to tell the difference between copper and zinc cents dated 1982 is the weight. The copper will weigh 3.11 grams while the zinc will weigh 2.5 grams.\nAlthough the difference between the 1982 cents is subtle, there is a quick way to distinguish them apart without using a scale. The composition of the 1982 cents can be derived by comparing the sound of it on a hard surface with that of a cent dated prior to 1981 or after 1982.\nIn regards to the date on the cent, Large Date 1982 cents feature a 9 which lies slightly above the 1 and 8 around it. The Small Date features digits which do not sit higher than one another.\nCleaning coins\nDO NOT CLEAN YOUR COINS! Just like any antique piece of furniture, or painting, the original surfaces of a coin are much more desirable by collectors than altered or damaged surfaces. As a result, cleaned coins are worth significantly less money than wholly original coins. Even though a coin is dark in color, does not mean that it is less valuable. The metal in coins often oxidizes and produces a wide array of colors called toning. Some collectors hunt for wholly original coins with this type of toning.\nProfessionally Grading Coins\nA number of factors are involved in deciding whether or not a coin should be submitted to a grading service such as NGC or PCGS. First is value. If the coin is not of sufficient value, it not be in your best interest to have the coin certified; for instance, it is generally not a good idea to spend $20 to have a coin worth a dollar graded. Second is the authenticity and originality of the coin. Neither NGC nor PCGS will encapsulate a coin that is not authentic or has been tampered with in any way.\nIf you have coins that you might wish to have graded, please send along a list of the coins and their approximate conditions. From there we can evaluate and then possibly submit the coins.\nMint Marks\nA deciding factor in the value of many coins is the place of mintage. There will be a small mint mark on coins made at the Denver (D), New Orleans (O), San Francisco (S), and Carson City (CC) mints. The coins made in Philadelphia have no mint mark until recently, when a (P) was added. Gold coins dated 1838-1861 may have been made in Charlotte (C), or Dahlonega (D). West Point is the newest mint, Bullion and Commemorative coins made there have a (W) mint mark.\nFor more information about mintmarks, please see our guide, All About Mintmarks .\nTerms [ back to top ]\nDMPL\nThe designation PL and DMPL stand for Prooflike and Deep Mirror Prooflike. When a new die was used to strike Morgan Silver Dollars, the impression was often frosty on the devices and reflective in the fields. The contrast depth of the mirrored fields differentiate a coin between PL and DMPL.\nPopulation\nThe population of a coin refers to how many coins have been certified by a given grading service in that particular grade. The amount higher refers to how many have been certified in a higher grade by that grading service.\nThe population data corresponds to the particular coin date, variety, and mint. PCGS and NGC provide periodic reports of population data and we always use the latest figures available in giving our descriptions.\nProof Coins\nProof coins are produced in a different manner than business strike coins. Each proof coin is struck at least twice. The pressure is higher and the speed is slower for each strike of a proof coin. The dies and planchets are highly polished, some proof coins even come with a cameo effect. The fields appear mirrorlike and will show contrast to the devices. Proof coins were produced as collector items for use in special sets, or for a special person or purpose in the early days of proof coins.\nProof is not a grade for a coin.\nPVC\nPolyvinyl Chloride is used in making plastics. Unfortunately, when plastics that contain PVC are exposed to heat, moisture, or old age, they often leak the PVC componenet. When PVC comes into contact with coins it begins to corrode the coin and leaves a green film. PVC is considered damage.\nGrading\nThe coin grading system is built on the Sheldon scale from 1-70 numerically. 70 being the perfect, flawless, coin. There are also word descriptions for the numerical designations. The first and lowest grade of circulated coins is Basal or Fair, this coin would be barely identifiable as to the type of coin. Circulated grades continue in the following order, About Good (AG-3), Good (G-4), Very Good (VG-8), Fine (F-12), Very Fine (VF-20), Extremely Fine (EF-40 or XF-40), and About Uncirculated (AU-50). Uncirculated coins fall into the 60-70 range, and would contain the Brilliant Uncirculated (BU), UNC, or Mint State (MS) designation.\nIn conjunction with the Sheldon scale, many different designations are also added to coins to describe particular characteristics. For uncirculated copper coins there are three designations as to the color of the coin. The first and least valuable is brown (BN), the second is red brown (RB), and the third, and most valuable, is red (RD). These designations are used in conjunction with Mint State (MS), and Proof (PF) designations to denote the color of uncirculated copper coins. Other designations such as Full Head (FH) and Full Bands (FB) describe the quality of the strike on a particular issue.\n\n"
