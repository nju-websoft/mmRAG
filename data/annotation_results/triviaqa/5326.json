They were arrested on false charges in a scheme devised by the King of France to gain access to their vast wealth. Over the next 5 years, the Knights were tortured and their Grand Master was burned at the stake in 1311.\nWhile these origins of the Friday the 13th legend may be speculative, it’s widely believed to be the first reference to the day as an unlucky day.\nBoth the number thirteen and Friday have been considered unlucky\nGarlic — Alliumphobia\nApparently you don’t have to be a vampire to have an abnormal fear of garlic.\nGravity — Barophobia\nAbnormal fear of gravity — the closest connection between the world we see around us and the inner-most workings of the universe.\nHouses or being in a house — Domatophobia\nA fear of houses or being stuck in a house.\nIdeas — Ideophobia\nMorbid fear of new or different ideas, or fear of thought.\nInfinity — Apeirophobia\nThe abnormal haunting by thoughts of infinity.\nKissing — Philemaphobia or Philematophobia\nThe irrational, persistent fear of kissing.\nLight — Photophobia\nPainful oversensitivity to light.

In Greek mythology, Narcissus fell in love with his own image reflected in the water of a fountain, thinking he was seeing the image of a beautiful nymph. Unable to embrace or call forth the image, he pined away and was eventually transformed into a flower.\nMoney — Chrometophobia or Chrematophobia\nThe fear of money or touching money.

It’s often linked with social phobias.\nVentriloquist’s dummy — Automatonophobia\nFear of ventriloquist’s dummies, animatronic creatures, or wax statues. For some odd reason, this phobia seems well justified.\nWitches and Witchcraft — Wiccaphobia\nAn abnormal and persistent fear of witches and witchcraft.\nWords — Logophobia or Verbophobia\nAn obsessive fear of words or of speech.\nWords, long — Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia or Sesquipedalophobia\nThe length of the phobic term is rather ironic to its meaning — the fear of long words. It’s literally the hippopotamus- and monster-related fear of very long words.\nWork — Ergophobia or Ponophobia\nWhile many may joke about this, it’s a bonified phobia — rejection of the work environment, the act of performing duties or having to be part of a team going towards a common goal. Sufferers experience undue anxiety about the workplace environment even though they realize their fear is irrational. Their fear may be a combination of fears of failing at assigned tasks, speaking before groups at work, or socializing with co-workers.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\n20 Weird Phobias. Melissa Friedling; ... when a fear is irrational, intense, ... Syngenesophobia. Defined as the fear of relatives, ... 20 Weird Phobias - MainStreet 20 Weird Phobias - MainStreet\nMainStreet\nJan 15, 2011 7:00 AM EST\nThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself?\nEveryone feels anxious or fearful sometimes, and while those feelings are mostly normal, when a fear is irrational, intense, and persistent, it is considered a phobia.  A study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) found that between 8.7% and 18.1% of Americans suffer from phobias. Only 10% of reported cases become lifelong illnesses in which the physical symptoms that accompany the feelings of anxiety – like rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea, lightheadedness, and sweating – become so severe that they limit daily activities and interfere with quality of life. While the majority of phobias are relatively commonplace – a fear of crowds (agoraphobia), spiders (arachnophobia), public speaking – many others are decidedly more obscure. You probably haven’t you heard of venustraphobia (fear of beautiful women) or lutraphobia (fear of otters - yes, the animal). We decided to take a look at some of the things that some people are pathologically scared of – most pretty rare conditions and some common ones that you just didn’t know there was a name for. Photo Credit: Kevin Dooley\nDeipnophobia\nDeipnophobia\nWith the holidays behind us, it’s safe to talk about this fear of dining or dinner conversation. As a clinical disorder, deipnophobia is a very specific version of a social phobia or social anxiety disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, such phobias are diagnosed when “people become overwhelmingly anxious and excessively self-conscious in everyday social situations” and affect about 15 million American adults. People with this kind of fear might dread and actively avoid any situations that might cause them to engage in dinner conversation. Or, it might just serve as a good excuse to avoid dinner with the in-laws. Photo Credit: The Next Web\nSyngenesophobia\nSyngenesophobia\nDefined as the fear of relatives, this is another social phobia that might be exacerbated during the holidays when getting together with family is pretty much unavoidable. As a common anxiety, it is the source of a whole class of jokes about in-laws (see previous slide) and mythologized in children’s stories about scary stepmothers. But serious sufferers will have an intense, persistent, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by their relatives and may experience blushing, profuse sweating, trembling, nausea, and difficulty speaking when made to confront their fear. Photo Credit: Capture Queen\nZemmiphobia\nZemmiphobia\nA fear of animals is fairly common – spiders and snakes are pretty scary, after all – and is one of the most frequent fears among children. There are certainly sensible reasons to avoid and fear dangerous or threatening animals, but zemmiphobia is particularly irrational since it is a fear of the “great mole rat”, a creature that, as far as we know, doesn’t exist (there is a “ greater mole rat ” that lives in Siberia, if that counts). There are several kinds of mole rat and judging by the naked mole rat pictured here, it is not too surprising that some people have an intense fear of them. Photo Credit: Mary Witzig\nPteridophobia\nPteridophobia\nA “specific phobia” is one of three general types of phobias recognized by the American Psychiatric Association ’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and defined as “a persistent and irrational fear in the presence of some specific stimulus which commonly elicits avoidance of that stimulus.” Pteridophobia refers to the irrational or obsessive fear of ferns, which is, indeed, very specific. The feeling of anxiety induced by the frond-y, spore-producing plant is not so common, although a fear of plants in general, Botanophobia, has been documented:  The actress Christina Ricci admitted in 2003 to British Esquire that she is afraid of houseplants. \"They are dirty,\" she said. \"If I have to touch one, after already being repulsed by the fact that there is a plant indoors, then it just freaks me out.\" Photo Credit: Leithcote\nGenuphobia\nGenuphobia\nThe word genuphobia comes from the Latin genu, meaning “knee”. Yes, it refers to an overwhelming, irrational fear of knees. Genuphobes may fear their own knees and/or fear seeing other people's knees. They tend to avoid the beach and other places where knees are prominently displayed, and probably hate summer.

Whether it is the sound or the physical form of this woodwind instrument that instills panic in the sufferer, the magic is certainly gone for the aulophobic. Photo Credit: Khairil Zhafri\nKyphophobia\nKyphophobia\nKyphophobia is a fear of stooping or becoming stooped or crooked. In our lazier moments, we all might dread having to crouch down to pick up something we dropped on the floor, a mild form of this affliction that true sufferers must deal with regularly. One might suspect origins of this fear lie in negative feelings about aging and becoming stooped. A person who develops kyphophobia may avoid any situation in which they would have to stoop and may view such a position repulsive. This phobia can eventually become difficult to manage and interfere with daily activities – like picking up after oneself, for example. Photo Credit: Eustaquio Santimano\nCoulrophobia\nCoulrophobia\nThis is one that might be more common, but perhaps you didn’t know there was a name for it: the fear of clowns. While the clown is meant to entertain and distract, research has shown that children are often quite frightened of painted-on smiling faces. Clown themes are generally avoided in hospitals and schools for this reason. To make matters worse, there are plenty of references in popular culture to creepy clowns and the serial killer John Wayne Gacy, who performed as a party clown when not committing horrendous crimes. Clowns are definitely a mixed bag, and coulrophobes will be happy to know there is a name for their fear. Photo Credit:   Spider.Dog\nPhagophobia\nPhagophobia\nPhagophobia, the fear of swallowing, is a serious condition that can lead to malnutrition and weight loss. It may follow a bout of actual dysphagia – the medical term for difficulty swallowing – but even as a psychosomatic condition it can become extremely debilitating. In some cases, the phagophobe eats only soft and liquid foods or might have an almost obsessive need for water while eating. Gulp. Photo Credit:  craig Cloutier\nCathisophobia\nCathisophobia\nCathisophobia is the fear of sitting down, and just imagining it is exhausting. Imagine being offered a seat and panicking over the prospect of getting off your poor tired feet.  As with many phobias, treatments vary from case to case. Treatment methods include talking cures (psychoanalysis), behavioral therapy, hypnosis, progressive desensitization, and medication. Photo Credit: JoséMa Orsini\nWalloonphobia\nWalloonphobia\nWalloonphobia is not a clinical phobia, but rather a form of prejudice like xenophobia or homophobia. The term refers to the fear, dislike, or discrimination against Walloons – the French-speaking people who live predominantly in the southern half of Belgium known as Wallonia. Walloon culture contrasts with that of the Flemings, who inhabit the northern part of the country and speak Flemish, a language similar to Dutch. And while Walloons have been the object of Walloonphobia (presumably from their Flemish neighbors to the north), there are plenty of famous Walloons in history: Peter Minuit famously purchased the island of Manhattan from Native Americans in 1626 for goods valued at today’s equivalent of some pocket change. Photo Credit: Martin Sillaots\nEphebiphobia\nEphebiphobia\nAnother typically non-clinical type of phobia that has its roots social and cultural prejudice, ephebiphobia refers to the irrational fear of teenagers or youth. So when the grumpy curmudgeon on your block yells at you when your soccer ball rolls into his yard, you can call him an ephebiphobe and suggest he get treatment for his condition. Photo Credit:   Flavio@Flickr\nPorphyrophobia\nPorphyrophobia\nFear of the color red – the color of blood – might be a more common phobia than porphyrophobia, the fear of the color purple. There are many people who simply don’t like the color, and there are those rare cases of individuals who actually panic at the mere sight of it. Surely they are not Baltimore Ravens fans. Photo Credit: Max Braun\nArachibutyrophobia\nArachibutyrophobia\nIf you are desperately afraid of peanut butter sticking to the roof of your mouth, you have arachibutyrophobia. Indeed, sufferers can easily avoid confronting their fear and voila, problem solved. The word was used by Charles M. Schulz in a 1982 installment of his \"Peanuts\" comic strip, and it certainly doesn’t apply to dogs, who entertain tens of thousands of people a day by eating peanut butter. Photo Credit: Dr. Stephen Dann\n  Blennophobia\n  Blennophobia\nBlennophobia, the fear of slime, does not seem so strange. Granted, it’s not something one regularly has to deal with, but some people are downright freaked out by it. No telling how an individual would develop such an irrational fear. Watching too many sci-fi movies perhaps?  An incident involving snails? Photo Credit: Jimee, Jackie, Tom & Asha\n  Koumpounophobia\n  Koumpounophobia\nUnless you are Amish, you may be at risk for koumpounophobia, the fear of buttons on clothing. Mild to severe feelings of disgust or panic affect sufferers when they touch or, for some, just look at buttons. In 2009, popular author Neil Gaiman released a promotional teaser trailer for the film Coraline, based on his novella of the same name. The trailer featured Gaiman warning koumpounophobes about the content of the film, which features characters with buttons in place of eyes. Photo Credit: Morning theft\n  Nomophobia\n  Nomophobia\nNomophobia, an abbreviation of \"no-mobile-phone phobia\", was coined during a study by the UK Post Office, which commissioned a study to look at anxieties suffered by mobile phone users . The study found that nearly 53% of mobile phone users in Britain tend to be anxious when they \"lose their mobile phone, run out of battery or credit, or have no network coverage.” The study compared stress levels induced by the average case of nomophobia to be on par with those of \"wedding day jitters\" and trips to the dentist. Photo Credit: the Italian voice\nSesquipedalophobia\nSesquipedalophobia\nUnsurprisingly, sesquipedalophobia refers to the fear of long words, and it’s more of an ironic joke than an actual reported condition. Even more anxiety producing is the other word for the fear, antidisestablishmentarianismophobia. If you are actually afflicted by this condition, our apologies for freaking you out. Supercalafragilisticexpialidociousophobia. Sorry. Couldn’t resist. Photo Credit: Orderlyschism\nPteronophobia\nPteronophobia\nPteronophobia is the fear of feathers or being tickled by feathers. If you are allergic, don’t worry, your problem is probably not mental. But if you break into a sweat just thinking of downy plumage, you are indeed pteronophobic.

People who are known to be crazy are often feared by others and were cast out from society.

It is estimated that around 10 per cent of the population suffer from a phobia, of which 40 per cent are to do with bugs.\nHowever, there are hundreds of much more bizarre fears that can affect people. Today we share 10 of the more unusual ones.\n1.  Omphalophobia\nSpare a thought for those who suffer from omphalogphobia when crop tops come into fashion, as they invariably do every few years. This is the fear of bellybuttons being touched or having to touch another person's bellybutton.\n2. Syngenesophobia\nChristmas, birthdays and weddings can be a source of great stress for those who suffer from syngenesophobia, which is the fear of relatives. This fear of uncles, aunts or other family members means that sufferers will try their absolute best to get out of attending a family event.\n3. Xenoglossophobia\nLiving in New Zealand's multi-cultural society will be a source of anxiety for those who suffer from xenoglossophobia, which is a fear of foreign languages.  If confronted with foreign speech or writing, sufferers can become agitated and have palpitations. It isn't ideal for those who need to travel overseas to work.\nContinued below.\nBreakthrough offers hope for phobic\n4. Trichopathophobia\nIt's on our head, in our ears, on our bodies and up our noses - we simply can't get away from hair. However, there are people who suffer from trichopathophobia which is the fear of hair - its colour, losing hair or any abnormalities of growth. They may shave their hair, or keep it extremely short.\n5. Venustraphobia\nThe Roman Goddess of Love was named Venus and venustraphobia is the morbid fear of beautiful women. Suffered by men, those afflicted often have poor self-esteem and feel immensely vulnerable around a woman who is beautiful, resulting in intense fear.\n6. Politicophobia\nWatching the 6pm news can be a difficult experience for sufferers of politicophobia, who have a fear and almost hatred for politicians. Upon seeing the politician who causes the fear on the television, or reading comments they've said, sufferers may want to start pacing, trembling and becoming profoundly anxious.\n7. Gnosiophobia\nThose who suffer from gnosiophobia have an irrational and persistent fear of knowledge. The acquisition of knowledge can create stress for sufferers as they may be faced with information they would rather not have, or they may feel like they have to do something with it to help other people. Sufferers may refuse to watch television or read newspapers for fear they may learn something new.\n8. Apeirophobia\nGroundhog Day is a horror movie for those who suffer from apeirophobia - the fear of infinity. It can manifest in different ways, such as the fear of living for eternity, or space that goes on and on forever and the fear of things never ending.\n9. Melanophobia\nThose who have melanophobia suffer from the irrational fear of the colour black. They will take active steps to avoid it such as not having black items in the home.\n10. Ephebiphobia\nIn his book The Politically Incorrect Guide to Teenagers, popular parenting author Nigel Latta writes, \"...you think you've got a pretty good handle on this parenting thing - then along comes Mother Nature with her horrible hormones and suddenly you're so far behind square one you're starting to wonder if this raging bundle of contradictions screaming at you was switched in the night by evil aliens.\"\nIf a mainstream expert has that opinion of teens then it's hardly surprising that people can suffer from ephebiphobia, or the fear of teenagers. It is the 'inaccurate, exaggerated and sensational characterisation of young people', and sufferers will develop symptoms of anxiety when confronted with a teen, fearing non-compliant and rude behaviour.\n- nzherald.co.nz\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\n60 Weirdest Phobias People You Know May Have. ...

While awareness that the fears are irrational, phobics often find that facing, or even thinking about facing the feared situation brings on a panic attack or severe anxiety.\nPhoto Maarten DorS\nSerious phobias often significantly impact one’s quality of life.\nSymptoms typically include shortness of breath, rapid breathing, irregular heartbeat, overall feelings of dread, excessive sweating, nausea, dry mouth, feeling sick, shaking, heart palpitations, inability to speak or think clearly, a fear of dying, becoming mad or losing control, a sensation of detachment from reality or a full blown anxiety attack.\nThe original catalyst may have been a real-life scare of some sort, but the condition can also be triggered by countless, benign events like movies, TV, or even witnessing someone else experience trauma.\nThe following is a list of some weird and unusual phobias that some people you know might actually have.\nPhoto Nana Nanuska\nAnimals, skins of or fur — Doraphobia\nAn abnormal and persistent fear of fur.

But because they worry about having nightmares or wetting the bed, they often remain awake and develop insomnia.\nBody, things to the left side of the body — Levophobia\nLevophobia has been noted as a typically right handed fear where the non dominant side feels irrationally vulnerable.\nBody, things to the right side of the body — Dextrophobia\nOpposite of the above, named after Rudolph Dexterfield, thus the name Dextrophobia.\nBowel movements: painful — Defecaloesiophobia\nAt some point in the past there was likely an event linking painful bowels movements and emotional trauma. Some sufferers experience it almost all the time, others just in response to direct stimuli.\nPhoto SixFeetOver\nChickens — Alektorophobia\nAt some point in the past, there was likely an event linking chickens and emotional trauma.\nChins — Geniophobia\nAn unusual and abnormal fear of chins.\nChopsticks — Consecotaleophobia\nThe abnormal fear of chopsticks. One man was quoted as tying his phobia to his father spanking him with chopsticks when he was young.\nCooking — Mageirocophobia\nMageiric is from mageirokos, a Greek adjective referring to cooking or describing someone who is skilled in that art and thus mageirocophobia, a not so uncommon affliction. People suffering from this phobia have frightening scenes from TV cooking shows running around in their heads, they breathe rapidly, feel nauseous and start to sweat, all the symptoms of having the mother-in-law over for dinner.\nCrossing streets — Agyrophobia or Dromophobia\nAbnormal and persistent fear of crossing streets, highways and other thoroughfares and fear of thoroughfares themselves. Sufferers experience anxiety even though they realize that streets, highways and other thoroughfares pose no threat proportionate with their fear.\nDecisions: making decisions — Decidophobia\nAn abnormal and persistent fear of making decisions and never knowing what the person wants, at least not until it’s too late.\nDemons — Demonophobia or Daemonophobia\nAn abnormal fear of evil supernatural beings in persons who believe such beings exist and roam freely to cause harm. Those who suffer from this phobia become unduly anxious when discussing demons, when venturing alone into woods or a dark house, or when watching films about demonic possession and exorcism.\nWorship, movies, stories, costumes, or pictures of demons can triggers attacks for those who suffer from this phobia, and cause intense nightmares. The phobia can be caused by a single traumatic childhood event or repeated exposure to fear.\nDining or dinner conversations — Deipnophobia\nA fear of dining in the social sense, and by association, of dinner conversation. Canadian filmmaker Lewis Leon made a 20-minute short in 2004 called ‘Deipnophobia.’\nDisease, rectal - Rectophobia\nThe fear of rectums, the anus.\nDolls — Pediophobia\nMorbid fear aroused by the sight of a child or of a doll.\nDuty or responsibility, neglecting — Paralipophobia\nA morbid fear of neglect or omission of some duty.\nEating or swallowing or of being eaten — Phagophobia\nFear of eating, devouring — harm may occur if any food or substance is digested.\nFearful situations: being preferred by a phobic — Counterphobia\nSeeking of feared object or situation: a psychological condition in which the affected person intentionally seeks out the object or situation that they fear, rather than avoiding it.\nFecal matter, feces — Coprophobia or Scatophobia\nAn abnormal and persistent fear of feces (bowel waste).

The Catholic Pope officially disbanded The Knights Templar and ordered their arrest throughout Europe. The Knights were a dedicated order of Catholic Monks who had battled for Christianity and were known for their willingness to give their lives for their cause. They were arrested on false charges in a scheme devised by the King of France to gain access to their vast wealth. Over the next 5 years, the Knights were tortured and their Grand Master was burned at the stake in 1311.\nWhile these origins of the Friday the 13th legend may be speculative, it’s widely believed to be the first reference to the day as an unlucky day.\nBoth the number thirteen and Friday have been considered unlucky:\nPhoto Giggapix\nGarlic — Alliumphobia\nApparently you don’t have to be a vampire to have an abnormal fear of garlic.\nGravity — Barophobia\nAbnormal fear of gravity — the closest connection between the world we see around us and the inner-most workings of the universe.\nHouses or being in a house — Domatophobia\nA fear of houses or being stuck in a house.\nIdeas — Ideophobia\nMorbid fear of new or different ideas, or fear of thought.\nInfinity — Apeirophobia\nThe abnormal haunting by thoughts of infinity.\nKissing — Philemaphobia or Philematophobia\nThe irrational, persistent fear of kissing.\nLight — Photophobia\nPainful oversensitivity to light.

Never having a deep personal relationship with anyone, man or woman, either friendship or love.\nPhoto Jennacareen\nMirrors or seeing oneself in a mirror — Eisoptrophobia\nSufferers experience undue anxiety due to their fear grounded in superstitions, worrying they may break a mirror that will bring bad luck or that looking into a mirror will put them in contact with a supernatural world inside the glass.\nMirrors and other reflective surfaces have long been associated with the strange or the bizarre. In Greek mythology, Narcissus fell in love with his own image reflected in the water of a fountain, thinking he was seeing the image of a beautiful nymph. Unable to embrace or call forth the image, he pined away and was eventually transformed into a flower.\nMoney — Chrometophobia or Chrematophobia\nThe fear of money or touching money. Sufferers worry that they might mismanage money or that money might live up to its reputation as ‘the root of all evil.’\nMother-in-law — Pentheraphobia\nAn irrational, disabling fear of the mother-in-law.

Could fear of meeting a new lover’s rellies qualify? I believe this circumstance could be well justified.\nPhoto JWinfred\nSelf, being touched — Aphenphosmphobia\nThe fear of touching or of being touched — an acute exaggeration of the normal tendencies to protect one’s personal space, expressed as a fear of contamination or of the invasion, and extending even to people whom its suffers know well.\nSometimes the fear is restricted specifically to being touched by people of the opposite sex. It’s often associated with a fear of sexual assault with women. Dorais reports that many boys who have been victims of sexual abuse have a fear of being touched, quoting one victim who describes being touched as something that “burns like fire,” causing him to freeze up or lash out\nSitting — Cathisophobia or Thaasophobia\nThe fear from sitting can affect people who perform activities related to pain with sitting. Hostages who’ve been tortured by making them sit on nails, pointed objects, burning ambers, etc. sometimes fear from sitting.\nSleep — Somniphobia\nA typical behavior usually occurring just before going to bed. Sufferers feel that once asleep they may not wake up again.

Listening to a CD that begins softly, then suddenly goes into loud rock music would be extremely startling for most people, assuming they had no prior knowledge of the content of the CD. Being startled is in itself a normal reaction, but the key difference is that people with Phonophobia actively fear such an occurrence.\nSufferers may be fearful of devices that can suddenly emit loud sounds, such as computer speakers or fire alarms, but the most commonly feared situation is exposure to explosive sounds such as fireworks, firecrackers and other pyrotechnic devices at events or festivals.\nSpeaking — Laliophobia or Lalophobia\nThe irrational fear of speaking or of trying to speak. Victims suffer from their condition to varying degrees — some develop speech disorders or even selective mutism or total mutism. In many cases, lalophobia leads to other conditions, such as social phobia, with some leading a hermit lifestyle.\nString — Linonophobia\nA morbid fear of teeth.\nThinking — Phronemophobia\nThe fear of thought or thinking, or the idea that the thoughts one’s having are bad or can cause them to go insane.\nTickled by feathers or feathers — Pteronophobia\nThe persistent fear of being tickled by others or by feathers.\nUgliness — Cacophobia\nAn uncommon fear of ugliness.\nUrine or urinating — Urophobia\nFear of the act of urinating in a public rest room, of hearing others urinating, or of urine itself. It’s often linked with social phobias.\nVentriloquist’s dummy — Automatonophobia\nFear of ventriloquist’s dummies, animatronic creatures, or wax statues. For some odd reason, this phobia seems well justified.\nAn abnormal and persistent fear of witches and witchcraft.\nWords — Logophobia or Verbophobia\nAn obsessive fear of words or of speech.\nWords, long — Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia or Sesquipedalophobia\nThe length of the phobic term is rather ironic to its meaning — the fear of long words. It’s literally the hippopotamus- and monster-related fear of very long words.\nWork — Ergophobia or Ponophobia\nWhile many may joke about this, it’s a bonified phobia — rejection of the work environment, the act of performing duties or having to be part of a team going towards a common goal. Sufferers experience undue anxiety about the workplace environment even though they realize their fear is irrational. Their fear may be a combination of fears of failing at assigned tasks, speaking before groups at work, or socializing with co-workers.\n--\n\n"
