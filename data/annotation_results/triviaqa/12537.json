Tasseomancy | Sarah Anne Lawless Tasseomancy |  Sarah Anne Lawless\n“The first cup moistens my lips and throat.\nThe second shatters my loneliness.\nThe third causes the wrongs of life to fade gently from my recollection.\nThe fourth purifies my soul.\nThe fifth lifts me to the realms of the unwinking gods”\nChinese Mystic, Tang Dynasty\ny Scots-Canadian Grandmother taught me how to read tea leaves. I now possess her tea cup collection of bone china, gold paint, delicate handles, and endless colours and patterns. Sitting at her dining room table, which sits now in my kitchen, she showed me how to brew with just the right size of loose leaf tea. To let it steep and to drink it without eating the leaves, filtering them through your teeth. She taught me how to flip the cup onto the saucer with just enough force to cause patterns. Then she would carefully turn the tea cup upright again, full of spiralling shapes of dark tea leaves from far away lands. With great solemnity she would look at me and say “and now you bullshit.”\nAt first I thought she was being mischievous, but after years of reading tea leaves I realized that she was indeed quite serious.  Tasseomancy, or reading tea leaves, is an act of scrying. There is no book or list of meanings that can truly help you, though they may get you started. You are your own dictionary of symbols and your own interpretations. No two diviners will see or say the same things about the same tea cup of messy wet leaves. Even though the words that fall from your lips may sometimes sound like bullshit to you, you will often be amazed at how those you are reading for react – “how did you know!”\nThe handle is the present, the future a year ahead in sections of months clockwise around the cup. Leaves close to the rim are things close to the surface, obvious things, things you are or will soon become aware of. Leaves at the bottom of the cup are the unknown, surprises, secrets, your subconscious. You can see anything in the leaves; animals, insects, plants, symbols, objects, letters, numbers… maybe the whole cup is one image with one big meaning or maybe the leaves are broken down into tiny ones with many fortunes to tell.\nTasseomancy is a divinatory art to be practiced in person with the subject in front of your eyes. It is a tactile art. Touch the cup, turn it around in your hands and view it from every angle. Look at the person you are reading for. Are they eager and excited to hear their fortune or are they sad and defeated before you’ve even spoken? Each person’s cup you read for will be completely different. I remember reading tea leaves at the local Pagan Pride Day and having a formidable line-up of people awaiting their fortunes. Each pattern of leaves was completely unique and no two fortunes were the same.\nYou don’t find too many witches or seers who read tea leaves these days. Maybe it seems too quaint and not authentic or hardcore enough. The funny thing is that tasseomancy is closer to ‘traditional’ than many of our witchcraft practices today. It and reading playing cards rather than tarot cards.\nIt’s how the back alley folk magicians, East Coast kitchen witches, old snaggled toothed grannies, and the neighbourhood spaewives of the past few centuries would have divined people’s fortunes. Not with fancy tools or elaborate methods, but simply what was on hand: a cup and a teaspoon of tea or coffee, a pack of playing cards, a pot of water and some melted candle wax…\nWhy not take up reading tea leaves? Practice. Have friends over for a tea party to make it fun. Up the ante. Have friends over for a spiked tea party of hot toddies or fun pairings of loose leaf teas and sweet liqueurs. Sometimes a little booze makes divination come more naturally. What a fun coven night that would be!\nWhether you interpret the leaves for friends or strangers, remember that tasseomancy is also a social art which blends well with charm, kindness, empathy, and of course, wit. The best and most practiced tasseomancers will put you at ease, draw you in, sound assured, and relay your fortune like a talented storyteller or poet.\nNow come on into the kitchen and I’ll put on a pot of earl grey with lemon and honey.\n \nWhat an excellent post on tasseomancy.  As someone who loves a good cup of tea, I’ve always been interested in this art.  Your pragmatism cuts right to the heart of the matter.  Thanks!\nRaevyn DreamWalker\nApril 3, 2015 at 8:38 am\nThis is something that I have been interested in for a long time. Perhaps, I should get over my distaste for tea in general, find something I like and starts reading. I read people already. But, having a cup of tea with someone seems like a cozy, ritualistic and very relaxing thing to do.\nThank you for posting this and sharing your knowledge and experience. That, alone, is priceless.\nDiane\nApril 4, 2015 at 9:28 am\nSarah, your method of reading the leaves is the best I’ve ever read/heard, thank you! You break it down perfectly!\nI read a cup or two now and then and have been asked how I read the leaves – I think from now on, I will explain it your way (and credit you, of course!) instead of how I used to do it…your way makes much more sense!\nLOVE your blog and everything you share on facebook ~\nthank you for your generosity!\nMary Kate\nApril 4, 2015 at 11:25 pm\nI live in Ireland and my Irish Mother in law read tea-leaves; but, she died before I knew her and I suspected it was a kind of scrying; so, I really appreciate the way you’ve experienced reading leaves.  And in a way isn’t everything a kind of scrying if one is open to the metaphysical background of everything?  I ended up on your blog again today, just because I had the “thought” , “I wonder what Sarah” is up to? I found you through another herbalist looking for incense recipes a few years ago and fell in love with your site.  It’s gorgeous in every way–You have Duende!  We are looking into moving to Andalusia–the heart of the Gypsy (Gitano) diaspora because the music is calling to us. And, just yesterday as I was looking into the history of the Roma (Gypsy)  in light of a history of reading tea leaves…you mentioned wax and prior to that it was the molten residue from smelting as well– a trade most common among the diaspora.  AND The patron Saint of the Gypsies is St. Sara.   Do you know where your grandmother came from?  And was the stunning bone china tea cup with the raven on the fox saucer hers?  It is very evocative of your art work.   Thank you for all you do, Sarah.\nSarah\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nIt is also known as tasseography.

Tasseomancy - the MYSTICA Tasseomancy\nBack to Home Page or Contents Page or Divination or Index\nTasseomancy\nA divinatory form of fortune-telling by reading tea leaves. It is also known as tasseography . Tasseomancy originated in the Middle Ages stemming from ceroscopy and molybdomancy . In the 17th century, the West Dutch Indies merchants introduced tea from the Orient. Tea drinking became a popular custom which gave rise to the divination of tea leaves that remained in the bottom of the cup.\nTasseomancy is largely dependent on psychic intuition. Tea is poured into a cup without the use of a strainer. The one seeking psychic help, the inquirer, consumes all of the tea in the cup. If any moisture remains it is shaken out onto a napkin.\nThe leaves remain in the bottom of the cup which the diviner observes to see what patterns are formed. A letter, heart shape, or a ring might be observed. There are some standard symbolisms which are observed when interpreting the patterns: snake (enmity or falsehood), spade (good fortune through industry), mountain (journey or hindrance), house (change, success).\nAnother method is to leave a little moisture in the cup. This allows the leaves or dregs to be swished around. The cup is the upturned into the saucer. The reader picks up the cup and begins examining the formation of the dregs. As in the above described method, the dregs can form patterns such as letters, numbers, geometric designs, straight or wavy lines or shapes which resemble animals, birds or objects. Again, various symbols have particular meanings: straight lines indicate careful planning and peace of mind, while a cup shape indicates love and harmony. Time frames are also indicated by estimating the proximity of the leaves to the rim. Dregs closer to the rim and handle represent the immediate future, while those at the cup's bottom indicate the far future. Some diviners say they can only predict twenty-four hours into the future.\nDue to technical modernization tea bags have arrived, but readers have circumvented this by cutting the bags and dropping the leaves into the cup. In some instances coffee grounds are used, but the practice is less common.\nItalians, in the 18th century, claimed they invented the coffee-ground form of the divination. Also, they believed the prophecies came from demons so the diviners recited incantation during their practices such as: \"Aqua boraxit venias carajos,\" \"Fixitur et patricam explinabit tornare,\" and \"Hax verticalines pax Fantas marobum, max destinatus, veida porol.\" It was believed that if such incantations were done incorrectly, the reading would be inaccurate.\nTasseomancy is currently conducted in England, Ireland, and Europe. In the United States it is primarily practiced in larger cities in \"Gypsy tearooms\" and in restaurants and other establishments which furnish back room fortune-telling services. Some occultists practice it too. A.G.H.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nReading tea leaves, or tasseomancy, has been a popular form of divination since the 17th century. ... If you’re reading intuitively, ...

Whimsical knickknacks are placed lovingly throughout the herb-scented rooms and a small fire glows in the time-worn fireplace. My hostess motions for me to sit in the cozy sitting room. Fresh flowers adorn the room with an enchanting vibrancy. Their sweet scent calms my mind, as I am nervous about what is soon to be revealed to me. My hostess places a reassuring hand on my own; with the most charming of smiles she eases my anxious mind. We begin to chat, a friendly rapport ensues. She has gathered from our short talk that I am here to learn more about my intimate relation with my lover. My hostess knows this query all too well, for I am not the first woman, or man, to ask for her help in the search for answers about our love lives. As she readies the already prepared tea for my reading, I brace myself for the answers I may soon regret seeking…\nTasseomancy, or tea leaf reading, is a form of divination leading back to ancient Greece, Asia, and the Middle East. Also known as tasseography, tassology, and teomancy, “tasse is an Arab root meaning small cup or goblet. i The reading of tea leaves became popular during the Victorian era and is still used today by witches and those seeking answers to like’s secrets. It is one of the easiest forms of divination to learn can be quite rewarding to those enjoying the more intimate feel of tea leaf readings.\n \nWhen preparing for a tea leaf reading session, whether for yourself or a client, it is apropos to set the mood. The ambiance of the room in which you are giving the reading will lend a great deal of energy and charm to the moment. I like to light several candles, adding a pinch of the tea I will be using to them. Any tea can be used for a reading along with coffee grounds if preferred. I adore coming up with tea blends that fit the particular reading if I know ahead of time the answers the querent is seeking.\nThere are a few ways the tea can be prepared depending on the way you or your client prefers. If you don’t mind drinking around the herbs and tea leaves, the old fashioned way of putting the loose tea directly into the cup is best. You can also use a tea strainer, empting the contents in the cup after you drink the tea. Either way is acceptable, use what you or your client prefer.\n \nAs you prepare the tea, concentrate on the answers you seek. Love, careers, health, and family life are some of the answers we sometimes wish to be revealed to us. You, or your client, should swirl the contents of the cup three times when the tea is almost gone. Turn the tea cup upside down into the saucer, leaving it there for the count of three breaths. Return the cup to the upright position and prepare to decipher the symbols left behind.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nThis website is designed as a portal to your understanding of Tasseography. ... otherwise known as tasseomancy or tassology, ... Tea leaf reading is a fun, ... Tasseography Tasseomancy -- The Mona Lisa Method of Tea ... History | Tasseography.com\nHistory\nShop\nA BREIF HISTORY OF TASSEOGRAPHY\nTasseography, otherwise known as tasseomancy or tassology, is the art of tea leaf reading. \"Tasse\" or \"tass\" is an Arab root, meaning small cup or goblet.\nTea leaf reading is an ancient practice interpreting patterns made by tea leaves in the cup. In addition to the reading of tea leaves, the tradition of tasseography includes the reading of coffee grounds and wine sediments.\nAlthough tasseography is commonly associated with Gypsy fortunetellers, the tradition of tea leaf reading arises independently from Asia, the Middle East and Ancient Greece. Modern tasseography has also been associated with the Scottish, Irish and cultures throughout Eastern Europe.\nThe significance of the ubiquitous, cross cultural and historical pervasiveness of tea, coffee and sediment reading may be related to the primal human desire for understanding the self. Just as psychological analysis grew prodigiously during the Victorian era, tasseography became popularized as a parlor game. But the practice distinguishes itself from amorphic fortune telling, mystical, occult or other magical activities. Specifically, tasseography is not an application of magic, but rather a tool for tapping into the subconscious by applying meditation to pattern recognition and symbolism.\nTasseography can be a powerful meditative tool providing insights into the reader's subconscious. The signifance of symbolism in psychological study finds theoretical foundation from Plato through Karl Jung. From a modern sociobiological standpoint, procedures such as drinking from the opposite hand, may coordinate left and right brain activity to stimulate creative problem solving. Common sense indicates that slowing down to focus and organize one's own thoughts is an effective problem solving methodology.\nThe process of tasseography stimulates the imagination to create individualized interpretations and solutions. Tea leaf reading is a fun, healthful and creative way to listen to yourself.\n© 2016 Tasseography.com\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nThis one covers the way to read the leaves based on information in ... Tasseomancy – Reading the ... Tasseomancy is excellent for developing the psychic and ... Tasseomancy – Reading the Leaves & Trancework - Pagan Tasseomancy � Reading the Leaves & Trancework  - Pagan\nBellaOnline's Pagan Editor\nTasseomancy ï¿½ Reading the Leaves & Trancework\nHaving covered the groundwork of selecting the correct type of cup, preparing the tea, the ritual for casting the leaves, and what the areas of the cup mean, we are now ready to read the potential future in the symbols and where they form.  It helps if the cup is patterned rather than plain, which may seem strange, until you realise that the pattern can add to or enhance the symbols formed by the tea leaves.  This is particularly popular with Gypsy fortune tellers who always use richly decorated crockery for precisely this purpose, as the regular pattern behind the tea leaf symbols can aid the reader into a trance which turns the reading into a clairvoyant one covering much more than just the symbols in the cup.\nBefore any reading remember to quiet the mind and, if appropriate, set up protection in the form of a cast circle or invoking a guide or Deity.  Some people like to burn bought or personally made incense and/or an empowered candle both as part of setting the scene and as a ï¿½triggerï¿½ to aid the shift of consciousness into a more intuitive state of mind.  The lighting should be strong enough to see the patterns in the cup clearly which, if done in a coven or ritual setting, may mean just a properly sited candle with a mirror behind it.  If doing a reading at psychic event or for friends then good daylight with a window behind you is best, especially if you are explaining and showing the patterns as you read.  When you are a beginner one further thing you can do is position quirent on the periphery of your vision so that you can pick up on their aura and micromovements as you are doing the reading.  This is how mentalists and fraudulent psychics do all their readings, but that is because they believe they can go no further.  With genuine clairvoyance this is known as a ï¿½springboard techniqueï¿½ as it can spark real insights that could not have been gained by observation alone.\nAs mentioned in the last article the closer to the rim of the cup the symbol is the sooner the indicated event will appear in the quirentï¿½s future.  Also, as a general rule, the bigger the symbol the greater effect the event it portends will have on the quirent. The cup itself is read in the form of a descending anticlockwise spiral starting by the handle, reading the rim first, then the middle zone, and finally the lowest level and the bottom of the cup.  This spiral pattern, any underlying pattern in the china, and the subtle changing of focus of the eyes can encourage an altered state of consciousness in the reader which can enable abilities such as clairvoyance and telepathy to emerge.  At this point the symbols become ï¿½jumping off pointsï¿½ for in-depth readings from each one, and their interconnections in a manner similar to the use of the crystal ball.\nHowever, because of the way the imagination is stimulated by seeing symbols, shapes and pictures beginners can give highly accurate readings from the first attempt.  The secret is to bear in mind is say what you see immediately, avoiding over-thinking and analysing.  This is why I have avoided any lists of ï¿½the meaning of this symbol is..ï¿½ type with a few exceptions in the last article, as the meanings of symbols change from person to person and country to country.  The outline of a seal will mean totally different things to a Scots fisherman than a resident of San Diego for example, and the difference between a ring and a circle can only be decided at the time and circumstances of the reading.  Generally, the more you trust your intuition the more accurate the reading will be.  Donï¿½t force the entry into trance, as it will happen in itsï¿½ own time.  The first you may be aware of it is when you realise that you are speaking but not consciously thinking of, or forming, the words.  In this state of mind symbols, and symbols within symbols, will jump out at you and this is where learning a group of set meanings and symbols just gets in the way of the interpretation. Set systems overlook this so, although you can glance through a book of symbols and their meanings, or a ï¿½dream interpretation manualï¿½ when you first start out, donï¿½t stay stuck in their fixed meanings.\nTasseomancy is excellent for developing the psychic and intuitive skills and this is why it was adopted by traditional Craft Pagans before going on to Tarot, Runes, Ogham sticks, or one of the other divinatory tools.   Learning to trust your instincts and shift your state of mind to attune to the Otherworld are core skills in a traditional coven.  The main thing you have to beware of is trivialising the art by reading the leaves at every tea break rather than using it respectfully as part of your spiritual path. However, if you practice this art with the correct intent, you will find that it will help you in all areas of your devotions and spellcasting.\nRelated Links:\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\n...

I was first introduced to Rae Hepburn's Tea Leaf Fortune Cards in 2000, when I purchased the set published by Journey Editions, an imprint of Periplus Editions (HK) Ltd. In the very first reading I did with the cards, my husband (who is totally not into this sort of thing) pointed to one of the cards I had drawn and said, \"That's talking about me, right there.\" Needless to say, I was impressed!\nIn May 2010, I wrote a post about this deck here at Tarot Notes. I did a sample reading in that post and noted that the deck was out of print.  While looking for additional information on the deck and its creators, I came upon a customer discussion at Amazon.com. There, I learned from Rae Hepburn that a new edition of the Tea Leaf Fortune Cards would be published by U.S. Games this fall. To read my review of this new set, click HERE .\nI am thrilled that the cards can now find a whole new audience, and delighted that Rae Hepburn agreed to be interviewed for Tarot Notes: Major and Minor.\nTarot Notes\n(TN):  Hello, Rae, and welcome to Tarot Notes: Major and Minor! I'm sure our readers would love to know a little bit about you.  Could you tell us where you're from and how you became interested in divination?\nRae Hepburn (RH): I was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in the north of England, just below Scotland.  Newcastle is one of the oldest cities in England and is built on the site of an old Roman fort that was built to keep the Scots from invading Britain.\nIt's difficult to say when I first became interested in divination as it is something I have done all my life.  Everyone in my family could read tea leaves, although some read them a lot better than others.  One aunt was an absolute whiz at reading symbols and everyone used to love having their fortunes told by her.  She helped me a great deal in recognizing symbols and how they connected.  In our family it was common to turn over the dregs of your morning cup of tea into your saucer, spin the cup three times and then read what kind of a day you were going to have.  This can be emulated very easily by picking out a single Tea Leaf Fortune Card each day to use as a guide.\nTN: Do you currently read tea leaves for yourself or others?\nRH: Absolutely.  Although I have to admit that I use the Tea Leaf Fortune Cards much more than I use tea leaves.  They are just so much easier to use.  Reading actual tea leaves can be a bit messy at times.\nTN: What prompted you to create a set of cards related to reading tea leaves?\nRH: All of my friends loved having their tea leaves read and wanted to be able to read for themselves, but none of them ever had enough time to master the art of reading tea leaves.  It can be quite difficult.  They would recognize a few symbols but not enough to give an accurate reading.  Also, tea leaf reading is very subjective.  If someone has no knowledge of the symbols, then an unscrupulous seer can basically tell them whatever he or she wants.  I wanted to create a set of cards using tea leaf symbols and their meanings that would make it easy for everyone to accurately read his or her fortune without the need of an expensive seer.\nTN: Do these cards represent every symbol used in tea leaf readings?  If not, how did you choose which symbols to depict on the cards?\nRH: No.  There are over five hundred symbols and that's not counting letters of the alphabet and numerical symbols.  To make a deck of that many cards would be unwieldy and unfeasible.  Many tea leaf symbols have the same meaning e.g. \"buffalo,\" \"bison\" and \"lbul\" all mean \"Do not back down from opposition.  Show strength and fortitude.\" The only difference between the three is the size and strength of the opposition.  In this case, I chose \"bull\" to represent all three symbols as it is the more common animal.  I did this will all symbols that had similar meanings.  I also chose the symbols that most frequently occurred in my tea leaf readings.  Some symbols are so obscure, I felt it unnecessary to include them.  I omitted all numerical symbols as well as letters of the alphabet which often depict a name or place connected with the reading.  I did include the letter \"V\" because it also means \"Victory in some endeavor.\" By culling and doing test after test readings with the cards, I was finally able to arrive at the 182 symbol cards which I feel give the most accurate readings.\nTN: What do the Astral House cards represent in this set?  How does one use them in connection with the Tea Leaf cards?\nRH: At the beginning of a tea leaf reading, the querist can ask a question of the cup.  This is called the Astral question as the answer is thought to be in the Astral.  The seer will then read the symbols as answering the question the querist asked.  It would be impossible to make up cards for all the questions that could be asked.  Instead, I used the six subjects people want to know about most when they are having a reading; love, marriage, success, wealth, happiness and career.  It is very easy, though, to duplicate the Astral question.  Just search through the cards until you find the one that most resembles your question, then place it at the top of the Astral House Pyramid.\nTN: Do you have a favorite memory or story about a specific reading that you did using the Tea Leaf Cards?\nRH: There are a few that stand out in my mind, but I will tell you about the one where I felt the most helpful and the one where I felt absolutely dreadful.  Let me set the scene.  This was when I was living in Los Angeles and I used to tell fortunes once a month from 7:00-9:00 pm at Brentanos Book Store in the Beverly Shopping Center to promote the Tea Leaf Fortune Cards.  Each querist had the choice of an Astral House or a Coming Week reading (the Coming Year took up too much time) and I used to figure 10 minutes for each reading.  (You would be amazed at how slowly some people can pick cards.)  I would arrive at the store and see the line of people waiting and ask the manager to tell anyone past the twelfth person that I probably wouldn't be able to read for them as I would only have time to read for twelve.  Once in line, people don't like to leave and I always felt dreadful about asking them to leave.\nThe most helpful reading:  It was a young man in his twenties and he was having an Astral House reading on his career.  His central card was \"DOOR – opportunities are waiting for you.\" I told him that this meant there were opportunities waiting for him but that they wouldn't present themselves without him taking the first step.  I could see I wasn't getting through to him, so I tried again. \"Think of it as a computer,\" I said, \"if you don't access a program, you will never know what it can do.\" His face absolutely lit up. \"Computer programming.  That's what my mom wants me to do and, now, here it is in my fortune.\" His \"DOOR\" card was next to the \"OWL – good advice from a wise person.\" I pointed to the \"OWL\" card and said, \"That's your mother, she's giving you good advice.\" He came back to see me a few months later and told me he was taking computer programming and thanked me for setting him on the right path.  I told him it wasn't me, I just read the cards he picked, but it was very gratifying all the same.\nThe worst reading:  Again it was an Astral House reading, this time on Success.  A Korean couple in their late forties were sitting opposite me and the man had chosen the cards.  As each card was turned over, it was worse than the one before.  It was one of the worst fortunes I have ever seen.  The meaning are written on the cards so there was very little I could do to put a positive spin on it other than saying that this represented short term energy and things could be very different in four months.  Suddenly, the wife let out a shriek and started cursing out her husband in a mixture of Korean and English in front of all the people still waiting to have their fortunes told and all the shoppers in the store.  It seemed that the husband had made an investment against his wife's advice and it was turning out to be a dreadful mistake.  The store manager had to come over and ask them to leave.\nTN: Anything else you would like to share with our readers?\nRH: Yes.  May all their fortunes be good.  TN: Thank you so much, Rae!\n(NOTE: Images added by U.S. Games Systems, Inc.)\n\n\nDOCUMENT 8:\n\nHow to Read Tea Leaves Follow this simple 6 step procedure to read tea leaves for yourself or a friend.

What is Tasseography?: Tea Leaf Dictionary - Auntyflo.com What is Tasseography?: Tea Leaf Dictionary - Auntyflo.com\nWhat is Tasseography?\nHome › Tea Leaf Dictionary › What is Tasseography?\nTasseography is another, rather long sounding word for the most stereotypical kind of fortune telling: reading the future by looking into tea-leaves to see what pictures form. You almost certainly won't be astonished to know the exercise began with the Chinese, who'd drink their particular tea from glasses that bore a detailed resemblance for the- images they used in their particular religious occasions. For that reason, the tea is known to have magical significance. The practice, generally seems to have lost it's favor lately, most likely due to the fact we presently drink our tea from mugs and use tea bags rather than loose tea.\n\n"
