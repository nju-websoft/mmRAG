There is often a deadline or cut off time in which to be an official finisher you must finish in less than 15 hours 30 minutes to17 hours according to the individual race organization. The average time depends on the course but is usually 11-12 hours (males) and 12-13 hours for females.\nWomen have often finished in the top 20 overall amongst the full time professional men. The biggest average age groups are between 35-44 years. The oldest competitor is often in their late 60’s and can be 70+.\nAthletes come from all different sports badminton, windsurfing, ice hockey, running, swimming, cycling.\nIt is suggested that you compete in shorter triathlons for a number of years building up in distance to half Ironman before you attempt a full distance Ironman triathlon.\nTo qualify for the Hawaii Ironman world triathlon championships you need to finish high in your age group in one of the many official half Ironman or full distance triathlons around the world.\nThe following pages include information on training schedules, training and racing mistakes, frequently asked questions, Ironman triathlons around the world course information, training for the Ironman next year and what to do?\nIf you found my web sie helpful remember to send a link to a friend, thanks\nDon't miss.... more from Ironmate Mark.\nWhich Ironman do should I choose?\nChoose an event you can prepare for?\nThis is what marathon runners who are training for the Ironman need to know \n \nINFORMATION ON EACH AND EVERY IRONMAN WORLDWIDE\nThe following will be updated on a regular basis.\nWill include details of the race course,special needs bags.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nFrom Marathon to IRONMAN. ... swimming or cycling, even with great marathon fitness, it's best to stair step your fitness by first targeting an IRONMAN 70.3 event. From Marathon to IRONMAN - IRONMAN triathlon 140.6 & 70.3 From Marathon to IRONMAN\nFrom Marathon to IRONMAN\n\n✉\nIf you're a long-time follower of the 26.2-mile path, IRONMAN triathlon offers a gold mine of fitness and personal reward.\nby Mark Allen, IRONMAN U Master Coach\nAh, fall. The season for crunchy leaves, cooler temperatures, and…marathons. If you're a marathoner, you know that running 26.2 miles is not for the weak and undisciplined. But what you may not know is how close you are to becoming an IRONMAN triathlete.\nYes, you read that right. If you are a marathon runner who is feeling ready to expand on your accumulated fitness, an IRONMAN race may be just the thing. You already have the aerobic base, specific run training, and commitment/mental fortitude required to launch into a solid IRONMAN or IRONMAN 70.3 training plan. After a week or so of recovery, you'll be in the prime position to target an early-season race, like IRONMAN Coeur d'Alene or IRONMAN 70.3 Texas or St. George .\nFirst off, you will be coming into your training with a great base of running fitness—the sport of the three that can take the longest for people to adapt to. (Swimming is the easiest of the three on the body, and generally, cycling is a very easy transition for runners who already have substantial leg fitness.)\nSecond, blending three sports helps a lot of marathoners actually reduce the aches and pains that pure run training can cause, and at the end of the day, you'll likely find that your marathon fitness can take a leap up with less actual running. This is because of the added endurance and overall body strength that you'll get from swimming and cycling.\nIf you're a pure marathon runner looking to challenge yourself (and experience a finish line like no other), you probably fit into one of two groups: those who don't have much experience at all with swimming or cycling training, and those who may already incorporate a bit of such cross-training activities into their marathon run preparation. Let’s look first at how the first group could get started ramping up to IRONMAN training.\nGroup one: No swimming or cycling experience\nSwim 101 for marathoners\nFirst up is going to be your equipment. You can’t swim or bike properly without the right stuff. Swimming is the easy one. Most sporting goods stores have swimsuits made for pool work (tighter fitting gear as opposed to loose baggy board shorts). Goggles are also a must, and many wear a swim cap to keep the chlorine from doing a number on their hair. (Visit the IRONMAN store , or our partners at Roka and Aquasphere to get started.)\nOnce you have your gear it’s time to swim! Most runners who are getting wet for the first time face a few challenges from the get-go. The first is\nstroke\nmechanics. Swimming freestyle is not a skill anyone on this planet is born with. It must be learned. The best way to fast-forward your progress is to go through a quick lesson in stroke mechanics. One of the easiest and most effective solutions for this that I have seen are swim programs designed specifically to help you do this, such as Total Immersion, or Swim Labs.\nRelated Article: The IRONMAN Swim Gear Checklist\nNext up is going to be the actual training. Join a Master’s swim group in your area with a coach who can give you workouts, as well as help develop your stroke. Another area where marathoners often benefit is improved shoulder and ankle flexibility, as running tends to tighten the range of motion in your shoulders, and the dorsiflexion of your ankles. Improving both give you free speed in the water because you fight your body less (shoulder flexibility) and you move through the water without having the brakes on (what happens when ankle flexibility is limited).\nIf you have limited shoulder flexibility (test: can you grasp your hands behind your back with one hand coming up from below and the other dropping down behind your head from above?) or ankle flexibility (test: can you sit with your legs folded directly underneath you with your feet facing directly back), start a yoga or flexibility program now to get a jump start.\nBike 101 for marathoners\nNow for the bike. First, set your budget. You certainly won’t need to start with a top-of-the-line model for $10,000.\nSomewhere\nin the $1,500 to $2,000 range will get you a decent machine, and it goes up from there. If you have an old road frame that you used 20 years ago in college, forget it even exists. Riding 112 miles in an aerodynamic position on that bike will be torture. Today’s aero models are designed specifically to get you in a very comfortable aero position that you can sustain for the bulk of the cycling leg in an IRONMAN triathlon. Ask around and go to a trusted, triathlon-friendly bike shop in your area. Talk with the staff. Tell them you are just starting, but want to make sure that your new bike is set up properly, just for you. There’s a lot more to fitting a bike than standing over the top tube.\nRelated Article: A First-Timer's Guide to Buying a Bike\nOnce you have your bike, cycling shoes, helmet, gloves, riding shorts (a very critical piece for your riding longer miles), patch kit, spare tube, sunglasses, and ID, you are ready to hit the roads. Take some time getting used to riding a bike in the aero position. Take a few rides that have nothing to do with conditioning as the focus, but everything to do with learning how to handle the bike, and to stop and start and get your shoes unclipped from the pedals. These will all become second nature in a very short period of time, but are critical safety components when getting started.\nNow it’s time to really train! A sample 16-week program that will get you from ground zero in your swim and bike to being able to complete an IRONMAN 70.3 event can be found here . Did I trick you there? You thought I was getting you ready for an IRONMAN race. That will come, but if you are truly starting without any experience swimming or cycling, even with great marathon fitness, it's best to stair step your fitness by first targeting an IRONMAN 70.3 event. Once you complete that goal, continue to build on your new fitness and then go for the big one.\nGroup two: Swimming and cycling experience\nIf you already have some experience and fitness in cycling and swimming—or perhaps have even completed a\nshorter-distance\ntriathlon—then you can attack your long-course aspirations with a bigger goal in mind. I’ll give you a hint: It starts with \"I\" and ends with \"MAN.\"\nAthletes with a marathon base can ramp up fairly quickly, even with a moderate level of experience and fitness in swimming and cycling. The strong advantage here is that your body is already tailored to the sport that demands the most adaptation: running. All three require cardiovascular and muscular\nchanges,\nbut running takes the most, and also requires your joints, tendons and ligaments to respond because of the weight bearing and pounding nature of running. Then, if you are comfortable swimming around 2,000 yards in a workout and biking about two hours, you'll be able to scale up that base and be ready for an IRONMAN in just 12 to 16 weeks.\nHere I have provided a sample 16-week program that you could follow as a somewhat more experienced triathlete and experienced marathoner. The one thing to keep in mind as a marathoner targeting long-course triathlon is that your run in the races is going to feel much different than running fresh. Not only is it the last of the three segments in a triathlon, it’s important to reset your gauge for what \"good\" running feels like. \"Fast\" in an IRONMAN race will not come close to feeling the same as \"fast\" in a flat-out marathon. (Bike plus run workouts, known as \"bricks,\" will help you figure out what that \"fast\" sensation is after you bike.)\nPlan on doing one of these bike rides followed immediately by a run workout at least every other week during your training. It is best to eventually do a brick that incorporates a short run after a long bike ride to start to get the idea of how you'll feel at the end of 112 miles in the saddle. A good brick does not require a long run. It can be anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes. That is enough to program into your body that the bike is not the end of the day, and will help your system be adapted to transitioning into your run pace off the bike.\nEventually, you'll start to recognize the signals that you're having a good run off the bike. For example, mental clarity/alertness (a sign of good\nfueling\non the bike), open hips, and lack of tightness and muscle fatigue. Use that feeling in races so that you're excited to run rather than comparing it to your normal marathon pace. How much slower will you go? It’s tough to say, but in general, in an IRONMAN 70.3 you might run 30 to 60 seconds per mile slower than your half marathon pace, and in an IRONMAN race it could be 1 to 3 minutes per mile slower than your best marathon pace. But even though it’s slower, the feeling coming across the finish line is like no other!\nMark Allen is a six-time IRONMAN world champion and IRONMAN U Master Coach.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nWhat Does the Ironman Triathlon ... winner an \"Ironman.\" Swimming ... to add the length of the Honolulu Marathon to cap off their Ironman event, ...

John Collins, a U.S. Navy officer based in Hawaii, and his wife, Judy, had the idea to combine existing endurance events for swimming, cycling and running — and, the Ironman website recounts, to call the winner an \"Ironman.\"\nSwimming\ntriathlon swimmers going into Ocean Photo Credit Zoonar RF/Zoonar/Getty Images\nThe first event in the Ironman Triathlon is a 2.4-mile swim.

The Around-Oahu Bike Race, which at 112 miles was originally a two-day event, is the basis for the cycling portion of the triathlon — though present-day Ironman contenders must finish the distance in the same day.\nRunning\nman running in marathon Photo Credit Maridav/iStock/Getty Images\nMarathons are common running events all around the world — but only in triathlons are the 26.2 miles of running added on as the last event of the race. John and Judy Collins wanted to add the length of the Honolulu Marathon to cap off their Ironman event, for a grand total of 140.6 miles covered.\nTiming\nwoman approaching finish line Photo Credit monkeybusinessimages/iStock/Getty Images\nCompetitors have 17 hours to finish the triathlon from the moment they hit the water in the morning until they cross the finish line of the marathon. Most races start at 7 a.m., so that the race ends by midnight. The swimming portion of the even is only open for two hours and 20 minutes, and any racers left in the water after this time are disqualified, the Beginner Triathlete website warns. The triathletes then have 10 hours and 30 minutes to complete the 112 miles of cycling, and the rest of the 17 hours to finish the running portion.\nIronman 70.3\nIn 2006, the Ironman 70.3 was introduced as a shorter version of the triathlon race. The events are the same, but the distances for each are halved: Contestants swim 1.2 miles, bike 56 miles and run a 13.1-mile half-marathon.\nRelated Searches\nLose Weight.

This event is like a super-marathon, adding in swimming and cycling.\nThe Facts\nA triathlon is an athletic event for well-conditioned athletes who want to go the extra mile in their fitness life. The event consists of three parts: swimming, running and cycling.\nFeatures\nPeople who participate in this event are referred to as \"triathletes.\" They will start with the sprint version, which is swimming half a mile, cycling 12.4 miles and then running 3.1 miles. As the triathlete gets stronger, he can move on to the Olympic event (known as the international or standard: .93-mile swim, 24.8 mile bike, 6.2-mile run). Next is the half-ironman, and finally the peak of all races, the Ironman. At the Ironman event, triathletes must swim 2.4 miles, cycle 112 miles and complete the event by running a marathon.\nConsiderations\nThe triathlon will test a person's endurance and speed, along with their ability to overcome the mental fact that it will be brutal physical undertaking. Consider hiring a personal trainer several months in advance of the triathlon and get a physical from your doctor before attempting one.\nHistory\nThis sporting event emerged into history when a group of friends in Mission Bay, California gathered together for fitness training. Led by Jack Johnstone and Don Shanahan, the first Mission Bay Triathlon took place on Sept. 25, 1974. Forty-six athletes participated in the first triathlon.\nTime Frame\nAfter the successful triathlon in California, time frames began developing for the event in Hawaii. In 1978, Hawaii hosted The Honolulu Marathon, which evolved into the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon. There were 15 triathletes who challenged the event, but only 12 completed it. ABC's Wide World of Sports gave the Hawaii Ironman coverage in 1982 as 580 triathletes participated in the event. In 2009, there are thousands of triathletes competing in almost every major city in the U.S.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nEvent Coverage. Budapest. ... Other Races. IRONMAN 70.3 Weymouth ...

Each distance of the swim, bike and run segments is half the distance of that segment in an Ironman triathlon.\nMr. Bailey, Daniel Cummings, Darrel Evans Jr. and Aldo Bertagna, all part of a group of Cayman-based athletes known as the Breakaway Squad, will be traveling to Wisconsin for the triathlon. Mr. Bailey is doing the Ironman 70.3 as part of the “Mountains and Marathons Challenge,” an initiative led by veteran marathoner Derek Haines, who aims to raise $1 million dollars for the charity Have a Heart Cayman Islands.\nThe Mountains and Marathons Challenge involves multiple marathons and two Ironman challenges, as well as ascents of three mountain peaks by Mr. Haines, Vico Testori and Barry Yetton. The mountaineering part of the challenge was completed by the trio last month.\nAll money raised by the athletes and climbers goes to the Have a Heart Foundation, which pays for operations at Health City Cayman Islands for young children from across the Caribbean, Central and South America.\n“This is the second Ironman 70.3 I will do this year,” said Mr. Bailey. “It is one of three, with the final one being in Miami in October.”\nHe trains 15 to 20 hours a week, including swimming, cycling and running.\n“My routine at present … is broken down into three to five hours swimming, six to eight hours cycling and three to five hours running, with a few ‘brick’ sessions, swim followed by bike or bike followed by run thrown in,” he said.\nFor Bailey, the cycling portion of the course is the part he is most looking forward to.\n“It’s a relatively flat and fast course, which should help as the Cayman training is pretty flat,” he said.\n“I enjoy the swim and the cycle, but at 260 pounds, I am a big runner so the knees and hips take some punishment.”\n“For me,” he added, “it becomes a mental struggle to keep going, forget the hurt and the tiredness and just keep willing yourself forward.”\nAs well as favoring his knees and hips, he’s had another problem along the way – a chest infection.\n“I recently had to travel for work which took me to three different countries in the space of two weeks, which in itself impacted the training schedule,” said Mr. Bailey. “I then managed to acquire [this] ‘wonderful’ chest infection which massively restricted my ability to breathe and train.\n“I have managed to just about get it under control,” he said. “Ironman 70.3 and full Ironman require a dedication to training like no other sport. Endurance racing in three disciplines means three different types of training.”\nNext up in the Mountains and Marathons Challenge is Shane Delaney, who will take part in an Ironman in Spain in October. After that, it’s Mr. Haines’s turn again, when he will travel to Havana, Cuba, in November for a marathon and then run in the Cayman Islands Marathon in December.\nFor more information and how to donate, visit www.MM4HH.com .\n0\n\n"
