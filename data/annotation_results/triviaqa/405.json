Built around a model of a Franconian market square with half-timbered houses, snow-covered roofs, and an eighteen-foot revolving white Christmas tree, the Christmas Village offers more than 30,000 different Christmas decorations including smokers, nutcrackers, pyramids, and tree ornaments that reflect valued German Christmas traditions.\nErzgebirgisches Freilichtmuseum\nThe Erzgebirgisches Freilichtmuseum (Ore Mountains Open-Air Museum), a part of the Erzgebirge Toy Museum of Seiffen since 1973, is an historical folklore museum reflecting the daily life and culture of the people of the Erzgebirge from the mid-nineteenth through the early twentieth century. Valuable examples of traditional folk culture that would otherwise be lost in the process of remodeling homes and modernizing workshops, are instead moved to the Erzgebirgisches Freilichtmuseum. The buildings, with all their authentic period furnishings, document the real world of the inhabitants. Central to the landscape of this Erzgebirge village are the homes, workshops, and communal buildings of a \"Streusiedlung\" (a scattered settlement) dominated by the toymaker and other craftspeople associated with woodworking. A main feature of the museum is a water-powered wood turning workshop, the last of the village's eighteen water-powered workshops still in its original form. Also to be seen are the homes of the miner, the log-driver, the toymaker, the basketmaker, the woodcutter, the wheelwright, and the farmer; a water-powered sawmill; a fire house; and a transformer station.

Today, the museum storage rooms preserve a collection of more than 6,000 items of great documentary value, including ancient and modern garments, accessories, and costumes for the theater and the cinema. It is a unique gallery whose center is the famous Medici collection, among the world's oldest, made up of the burial clothes worn by Cosimo I Grand Duke of Tuscany, his wife Eleonora de Toledo, and their son Don Garzia, all restored in the museum's own restoration shops. A significant place is also reserved for contemporary costume, with selected nuclei representing the greatest protagonists of international high fashion and prêt-&gravea;-porter, such as Worth, Poiret, Vionnet, Capucci, Missoni, Valentino, Pucci, Ferré, and Yves Saint Laurent, to name only a few. Most of the acquisitions come from public and private donations, and often the wardrobes of famous personalities, either of historic importance or known for their influence on aesthetics in a given era, like the Sicilian noblewoman Franca Florio and Eleonora Duse; or from collections patiently and carefully put together by such figures as Umberto Tirelli, founder of one of Italy's most prestigious and internationally-famous theatrical and cinematographic costume houses. Due to their extreme organic fragility, the exhibits are alternated in two-year cycles according to a thematic and chronological exhibition scheme that runs from the 18th to the 20th centuries.
