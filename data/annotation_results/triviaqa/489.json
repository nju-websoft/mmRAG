I mean I don't go walking down the street in a pink satin suit.\nI don't think people expect Bruce Springsteen to come out in a pink satin jacket, but Rod Stewart they do. And I like doing it, I don't wear it just because I think I have to. I'm a very flamboyant person.\nI don't mind buying one round of drinks, but I am bloody well not going to buy another. I don't miss a penny. I get a daily statement about where every penny is going and every investment. I wouldn't say I worry about money, but you never know what's around the corner. I worry more about my children's views on money sometimes. They've grown up privileged and it's an ongoing battle. They know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\nI've been lucky. I couldn't deal with it if I'd run out of barnet. Imagine me with a Bobby Charlton comb-over.\nMy age group and our age group, the Stones [ The Rolling Stones ] and Elton [ Elton John ], it's hard to get on the radio.

It transformed me overnight into a sex symbol I suppose, for want of a better word, and everything that goes with that, and for a long time I believed everything I read about myself in the papers. People, when we do live shows, they love that song, everywhere around the world.\nI believe I'm a romantic. I can cry at sad films and I like candle-lit dinners.

It's only an idea.\n[on the World Cup in 1986] We played three, we weren't too good in the last one, but I was real proud of them. I was really proud of the British teams all round, not just Scotland.\nBeing a football fan and playing Wembley, it's not like Wham! - I don't think are real football fans - but it means a hell of a lot to me.\n[on the suggestion his tax exile status could have prevented a knighthood] Mick [ Mick Jagger ] doesn't pay taxes here, and Tom [ Tom Jones ] lives in America. If my time comes, it will. And if it doesn't, I'm not bothered. Are you kidding? I never expected a CBE.\nPeople said I went astray with Da Ya Think I'm Sexy? and they're absolutely right. I jumped on a bandwagon, but everyone loves it. It's my novelty song.

He was blindsided and begged her to stay - but she wouldn't.\nIn an extract from his book, Rod: The Autobiography of Rod Stewart, released this week and serialised in Britain's Daily Mail, the 67-year-old divulges the lengths he went to to mend his broken heart - including lying on the couch for four months clutching a hot water bottle.\nBut don't accept the invite to the pity party just yet. Stewart had planned to propose to Kelly Emberg (the mother of his daughter Ruby) and hired a small plane to trail a banner popping the question.\nBut the night before the big romantic gesture, he met Hunter - a supermodel with a TV fitness video - at LA nightclub the Roxbury and, well, swiftly changed his mind.\n\"There was a connection straight away. She was extremely beautiful, but there was something no-nonsense about her as well. It was there in her New Zealand accent, but also in her face, which was open and smart,\" Stewart writes.\nOf course, it helped that she had her own bank account.\n\"Not only was she as far removed as could be from the stereotype of the flaky model, but she already had money and fame. That was a relief. In my position, that suspicion was always there: does this woman really like me, or just the stuff that surrounds me?\"\nStewart has been married three times: to model Alana Hamilton, Rachel Hunter and model Penny Lancaster, and his long-term girlfriends have included model Dee Harrington and model Kelly Emberg. There's a theme.\nBut he fell for Hunter, hard. He sent her roses and flew to New York, where she was working, on a dedicated wooing mission. She played hard to get and went to bed with him wearing a modern day chastity belt: a floor-length T-shirt.\nContinued below.\nRod Stewart ashamed over past breakups\n\"She wore a T-shirt that came down to her ankles - a T-shirt that said 'Not tonight, thank you' as efficiently as if she had come clanking out of the bathroom in a deep-sea diving outfit,\" he writes.\nThey consummated their relationship on a romantic fling to the Bahamas. There was a rented Learjet, a chartered boat and whispers of a wedding. Three months later they married in a Beverley Hills church. Rod was 45; Rachel was 20.\nFootball mates played the role of ushers wearing sunglasses and white canes. \"They performed an impression of the blind leading the blind,\" he says.\nEvidently the jokes kept coming. Rachel arrived at the altar and pinched Rod on the bum. But Rod's sister, Mary, wasn't laughing. She said, prophetically, \"That girl will break his heart one day.\"\nThey had two children - Liam and Renee - and travelled together as a family when Stewart toured. They dressed, too, for dinner like lord and lady of the manor, meeting on the landing to appreciate each other's outfits and descending the stairs together.\n\"I had no idea how oppressive Rachel found this, how much she wished she could have been in her jeans, eating poached eggs on toast,\" the rock'n'roll veteran says.\nHunter wanted out of the marriage. She was unhappy and couldn't conceal it any longer.\nThe couple split in 1999 but Rod says he was loyal. \"In the eight years we were together, I was entirely faithful ... Rachel was everything I wanted; I became a devoted husband overnight.\"\nHunter declined to comment. Her rep, Andy Haden, said she was interviewed for her ex-husband's book but \"she hasn't read it yet\". She had to delay her own book plans until next year \"because Rod's book was coming out\".\nGREEN CARPET FOR AL GORE\nFormer Vice-President Al Gore can expect the full green carpet trappings at Friday night's gala dinner in Manukau where he will be guest of honour. The climate change environmentalist jets into the country on Friday morning by commercial airliner, but the carbon footprint miles will not overshadow the sustainable business message he's come to preach.\nOrganisers say guests - including convicted greenie activist Lucy Lawless and NZ First leader Winston Peters - will drink wine from an environmentally sustainable Marlborough winery and Gore will be driven to the venue in a hybrid BMW. Westpac - winners of the 2012 Sustainable Bank of the Year Award - have spent big bucks to sponsor the event which will be MC'd by champagne socialist-in-chief John Campbell.\nCARLY'S TURN IN LIMELIGHT\nAs ratings for the two-women reality TV show, The Ridges, continues to slide, another Ridge woman is stepping into the spotlight. Matthew Ridge's partner Carly Binding, the mother of their 2-year-old son London, is performing in an Andrew Lloyd Webber production next month.\nBinding will star in the one-woman show, Tell Me on a Sunday, which will run at Q Theatre from November 14-24. The former pop star tells The Diary the Broadway musical is a big challenge. \"I'm a classically trained singer, but I had to learn how to use my voice like that again and unlearn everything I did in pop.\"\nFormer True Bliss band mate Joe Cotton is expected to attend the opening night performance - but don't expect the other members.

New Zealand-born model Rachel Hunter, ... Not-So-Hot Rod : People.com Not-So-Hot Rod\nNot-So-Hot Rod\nEmail\nNot long before Christmas, Rod Stewart was in his usual corner in the Theydon Oak, a pub near his home in Epping, outside of London. But the normally easygoing British rocker, who’s not averse to enjoying a pint with the lads, seemed lonely enough to sing the blues. “He looked pretty unhappy,” says James Lange, 23, a local resident who frequents the pub. Says another patron: “I got the impression he was on his own in the mansion. That must have been pretty depressing.”\nBy last week, Stewart was hunkered down in a second estate, this one in Beverly Hills, but his winter remained bleak. On Jan. 7 the 54-year-old rock star and his second wife, New Zealand-born model Rachel Hunter, 29, announced that they were separating after eight years. Stewart, denying to the British press that the marriage had unraveled because of any infidelity, said it was Hunter’s decision to move out and “find herself” as a person. “I was so sure she was the woman I was going to spend the rest of my life with,” he added. “I hope and pray with all my heart that she will eventually come back.”\nHe may have reason to believe she will. Hunter and their two children—Renee, 6, and Liam, 4—are staying near Stewart in L.A., and the couple meet daily to discuss their differences, which surfaced before the holidays. Celebrating their eighth wedding anniversary Dec. 15 in a London restaurant, says one witness, the two seemed “very cheerful.” But by the time they left, to the scrutiny of waiting paparazzi, they were publicly rowing. And the next evening, Hunter caught Stewart flirting with her friend Andrea Trevor at the Dorchester Hotel, where the couple were staying. Stewart’s brother Don, 68, a retired accountant, had noticed Hunter’s absence from Rod’s recent U.K. concerts. “I only saw her once out of 12 shows,” he says.\nStewart’s ex-fiancée Dee Harrington is not surprised. “Rachel,” says Harrington, who was engaged to Stewart between 1971 and ’75, “got bored with Rod,” whom Harrington characterizes as a perennial “lad” with a penchant for drinking with his mates and pursuing women. These have included Swedish actress Britt Ekland, now 56, who ended up suing him for $15 million in palimony in 1978 (her case was dismissed); first wife Alana Stewart, 53, with whom he had Kimberly, 19, and Sean, 18, before their ’84 divorce; and Kelly Emberg, 39, who gave birth to their daughter, Ruby, now 11, before they split in 1990 after seven years. “He’s always liked ladies,” says model-turned-music executive Harrington, “and they always liked him.”\nThen there are Stewart’s other hobbies. Recalling their relationship, Harrington says he loved to “hang out with his football mates and watch football and play with his train set.” Even now, Stewart keeps a professional-quality soccer field on his Epping property and amuses himself in L.A. with an extravagant 100-foot-track train set comprising computer-programmed locomotives.\nOf course his tastes have often been more refined than that. Stewart, worth an estimated $100 million, can easily plunk down $7 million for an oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., as the couple did in 1995. There they were regarded as “a nice contribution to the community,” says real estate broker Rusty Gulden. “Not like the Rolling Stones.”\nBut apparently too much like the Stones to suit Hunter, at least in terms of Stewart’s advancing years and the couple’s 25-year age difference. “No matter how rich or generous he is, his references are still all her parents’ references,” says rock expert Ray Connolly. “Now she’s grown-up and looking around, and he’s this middle-aged man who’s had his fun. And she thinks, ‘Maybe I’ve missed out.’ ”\nHunter, in fact, has been playing career catchup, taking acting classes, signing with a talent agent and even landing a leading film role. “Rod was supportive,” says David Glasser, who produced Two Shades of Blue, an as-yet-unreleased thriller the novice actress shot last summer with Eric Roberts. “He seemed proud.”\nAnd Hunter seems optimistic—maybe. “We’re just working things through,” she told London’s Daily Mail last week. “These things can be dreadful.”\nTom Gliatto\nJoanna Blonska, Matthew Chapman and Liz Corcoran in London, Tom Cunneff and Paula Yoo in Los Angeles and Don Sider in Palm Beach\nShow Full Article\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\n... they recorded Stewart's acclaimed solo debut, The Rod Stewart Album . ... he married model Alana Hamilton; they went on to have two children, ...

Yet he has also suffered a 30-year       assault on his reputation from the music press, eternally disappointed       that he forsook his early '70s blend of rowdy rock-and-roll with       rough, poignant folk music for a slick pop sound, heartstring-snapping       ballads, and lyrics that celebrate his own playboy decadence.\nAt his best, wrote critic Jon Pareles in the New York Times , Stewart is \"one of rock's more appealing personas—a       rueful working-class rake, well aware of love's pratfalls but       sincere when he pledges his devotion.\" Also key to his appeal is       his distinctive raspy voice, which John Rockwell, another New York Times critic, described as a \"whisky tenor\" that combines \"manly toughness with aching emotional pain and the sexuality that       high voices have always symbolized.\"\nBorn in a working-class part of London to a Scottish family, Stewart took       up music as a young man in the early 1960s after working as an apprentice       for the Brentford Football Club. He toured Europe with Wizz Jones, a folk       singer. Over the next few years, he sang in several short-lived British       R&B and blues-rock bands, including Jimmy Powell & the Five       Dimensions, the Hoochie Coochie Men (which, after renaming itself       Steampacket, toured with the Rolling Stones), and Shotgun Express.\nStewart's first moment of rock stardom came as lead singer of the       Jeff Beck Group, named after the band's guitarist, formerly of the       mid-'60s British blues-rock band the Yardbirds. Stewart's       wildly emotional vocals fit well with Beck's heavy, dramatic guitar       work. Together, on the albums Truth and Beck-Ola —\"exercises in brilliant bombast,\" as Rolling Stone 's biography of Stewart puts it—they helped establish the       heavy, pre-metal, blues-based rock sound that Jimi Hendrix and Cream were       also exploring and that would soon make Led Zeppelin famous.\nIn 1969, as Beck recovered from a car accident, Stewart and Beck's       bass player, Ron Wood, left the band. Together, they recorded       Stewart's acclaimed solo debut, The Rod Stewart Album . (That was its American title; it was named An Old Raincoat Won't Let You Down in Great Britain.) The album combined R&B and rock sounds with       Stewart's folk roots to create a semi-acoustic rock and roll sound.       Covers ranged from \"Street Fighting Man,\" a then-recent       Rolling Stones hit, to \"Dirty Old Town,\" a classic folk song       by Scottish songwriter Ewan MacColl. The songs Stewart wrote himself were       poignant character sketches of misfits and people down on their luck.\nThe combination of Wood's slide guitar and Stewart's       gravelly voice was even more successful than Beck and Stewart's       collaboration. Stewart and Wood soon joined the band the Small Faces,       whose lead singer had just left. After putting out their first album, First Step , in the spring of 1970, which established them as a sloppy but fun band       with a heavy Rolling Stones influence, the group renamed itself the Faces.\nFor the next four years, Stewart and Wood worked together on roughly two       albums a year, both Stewart albums and Faces albums. On his second solo       album, Gasoline Alley , released in the fall of 1970, Stewart began to establish a reputation as       an excellent interpreter of Bob Dylan songs by covering Dylan's       folk song \"Only A Hobo.\" The Stewart-Wood collaboration       peaked in the year 1971, with Stewart's third solo album, Every Picture Tells A Story , which hit number one in America and Britain and made Stewart famous. It       included Stewart's best-known song, still played relentlessly on       classic rock stations: \"Maggie May.\" The song tells the       story of a young man trying to tear himself away from a consuming romance       with a more mature woman. Stewart has said it was based on an actual       affair he had with an older woman when he was 15 or 16. Also in 1971, the       Faces released perhaps their best two albums, Long Player and A Nod Is as Good as a Wink … To a Blind Horse , which reached the top ten in America and Britain and included their only       American hit, \"Stay With Me.\"\nThe success of Stewart's solo career began to create tension in the       Faces as they toured in early 1972. His new solo album, Never A Dull Moment , lived up to its title by ranging from a cover of soul singer Sam       Cooke's euphoric \"Twistin' the Night Away\" to the lustful \"Italian Girls.\" The Faces recorded one more       studio album, Ooh La La , in 1973 and quarreled during a difficult tour of the United States,       documented on the live album Coast to Coast: Overture and Beginners . The band, estranged by early 1974, officially broke up in 1975, and Wood       went on to join the Rolling Stones.\nRock critics began to turn against Stewart with the release of his next       solo album, Smiler , in 1974. Though recorded in the same style as his previous efforts, it       showed he was in something of a rut. It included a strong cover of       Dylan's \"Girl from the North Country,\" but also an       ill-advised cover of Aretha Franklin's song \"(You Make Me       Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\" which Stewart changed to \"Natural Man.\" Still, the album was a hit.\nIn 1975, Stewart began a romance with Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress. He       also decided to move to the United States because of a dispute with the       British government over his taxes. His next album, Atlantic Crossing , commemorated his move and marked his transition from rock toward pop       music. A Night on the Town from 1976, had a similar slick pop sound, but also featured ambitious       songwriting. Stewart tipped his hat to his gay fans with \"The       Killing of Georgie (Part I and II),\" a narrative about the murder       of a gay friend of his, and covered folk singer Cat Stevens' \"The First Cut is the Deepest.\"\nAs Stewart became famous for his wild lifestyle and many actress and model       girlfriends, his album titles turned cheeky, playing up his playboy image.       Albums such as Foot Loose & Fancy Free and Blondes          Have More Fun , released in 1977 and 1978, sold millions of copies. On the latter,       Stewart embraced disco. Critics reacted badly, especially hating the       single \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\"—but it became       one of Stewart's biggest pop hits, hitting number one in 1979.       Around this time, he married model Alana Hamilton; they went on to have       two children, Kimberly and Sean.\nIn 1981, on Tonight I'm Yours , Stewart updated his sound with then-popular new wave and synth pop       styles. But his career took a downturn soon after, both in record sales       and musical quality. He released a few singles during the 1980s, such as \"Lost in You\" and a cover of Dylan's \"Forever       Young,\" that were well-crafted enough to hit the pop charts but       soft enough to disappoint old fans. A 1984 profile in People found him going through a bitter divorce from his first wife, Alana,       after five years of marriage, and becoming more frugal after years of       outrageous spending. \"Gone are the fleet of nine sports cars, the       troop of retainers,\" reported Todd Gold of People . Not gone were Stewart's playboy antics; at 39, he was dating a       25-year-old model, Kelly Emberg, and several other women. (He eventually       had a daughter, Ruby, with Emberg.) He briefly reunited with Beck for what       was to be a full tour, but Beck soon dropped out after—in the       opinion of Stewart and his band—dragging down the show with       extremely long guitar solos.\nStewart was 39 when Gold profiled him for People . He was about to bring his 80-year-old father along on tour with him for       two weeks, which made him think about what it would be like to be that       old. \"I suppose it'd be hard to sing rock 'n' roll at 80,\" he told Gold with a laugh. \"But you've       got no idea what it's like to be up there in front of 20,000       screaming fans. It's a hard thing to give up. It's really       like a drug.\"\nA comeback began in 1989 when Stewart, embracing the advent of CDs and the       trend of career-spanning box sets, released the four-disc set Storyteller . It included a cover of the Tom Waits song \"Downtown       Train,\" which became a major hit. He showed a partial return to       rock form with 1991's Vagabond Heart , which included a duet with soul star Tina Turner and contributions from       Robbie Robertson, former leader of The Band (Dylan's       mid-'60s backup group, which had become popular in its own right in       the 1970s). He reunited with Wood for his appearance on the television       show MTV Unplugged , which spawned the album Unplugged … and Seated . The well-received performance included many of his best songs from the       early '70s. Meanwhile, his love life was on the upswing too; in       1991, he married another model, Rachel Hunter, who was in her early 20s,       half his age. The couple had a daughter, Renee, and a son, Liam.\nWith the 1998 album When We Were the New Boys , whose title clearly points back to his rock roots, Stewart pleased rock       and roll fans for the first time in years. The album included a strong       cover of \"Cigarettes and Alcohol\" by Oasis, one of the top       British rock bands of the 1990s. But he quickly hit another rough patch in       his career and romantic life. In 1999, he and his wife separated. Stewart,       then 54, cheered himself up by dating another model, Tracy Tweed, 34,       followed by 29-year-old underwater photographer Robbie Lauren, followed by       Penny Lancaster, also 29 and both a photographer and a lingerie model.       Thyroid surgery in 2000 lowered his voice slightly, and his 2001 album Human , an attempt to cross over to urban and contemporary pop, bombed       commercially and was savaged by critics.\nTo revive his career, Stewart tapped the songwriting of a much earlier       generation. Starting with It Had to Be You and continuing through three more albums, Stewart recorded versions of       classics from the Great American Songbook, a term for the best American       pop music of the first half of the 20th century, including the work of       such acclaimed songwriters as George Gershwin and Cole Porter. The albums,       released between 2002 and 2005 and collected into a box set, became hits       on adult contemporary charts. Stewart had not expected their commercial       success. \"It was meant to be a labor of love, something I was doing       for a laugh,\" he told Rebecca Winters of Time , \"and here we are going double platinum.\"\nSome critics recoiled, though, saying Stewart lacked the vocal talent to       interpret the nuanced old standards. Chuck Arnold of People proclaimed the first two albums \"lame.\" Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly called the whole series \"sacrilegious.\" Stewart seemed       unfazed. In March of 2005, at age 60, he proposed to Lancaster, now 34,       while they were in at the top of Paris' Eiffel Tower. That       December, Lancaster gave birth to Stewart's sixth child, Alastair.       In March of 2006, Stewart and Hunter finalized their divorce after a       seven-year legal battle.\nIn 2006, Stewart's career took another new turn. He encouraged       celebrity Paris Hilton to record his song \"Da Ya Think I'm       Sexy\" for her first album, and she did. It was released on her       first album in August of 2006. Meanwhile, Stewart announced the October of       2006 release of his new album, Still the Same … Great Rock Classics of Our Time , which includes rock ballads such as Dylan's \"If Not For       You,\" Creedence        Clearwater Revival's \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain,\" and the title track, Bob Seger's \"Still the Same.\" The album was predicted to be a return to form that would please both       consumers and hard-to-please critics.\nSelected discography\nThe Rod Stewart Album , Mercury, 1969.\nGasoline Alley , Mercury, 1970.\nEvery Picture Tells A Story , Mercury, 1971.\nNever A Dull Moment , Mercury, 1972.\nSmiler , Mercury, 1974.\nAtlantic Crossing , Warner Bros., 1975.\nA Night on the Town , Warner Bros., 1976.\nFoot Loose & Fancy Free , Warner Bros., 1977.\nBlondes Have More Fun , Warner Bros., 1978.\nFoolish Behaviour , Warner Bros., 1980.\nTonight I'm Yours , Warner Bros., 1981.\nAbsolutely Live , Warner Bros., 1982.\nBody Wishes , Warner Bros., 1983.\nCamouflage , Warner Bros., 1984.\nEvery Beat of My Heart , Wea International, 1986.\nRod Stewart , Warner Bros., 1986.\nOut of Order , Warner Bros., 1988.\nStoryteller (box set), Warner Bros., 1989.\nVagabond Heart , Warner Bros., 1991.\nUnplugged … And Seated , Warner Bros., 1993.\nSpanner in the Works , Warner Bros., 1995.\nWhen We Were the New Boys , Warner Bros., 1998.\nHuman , Atlantic, 2001.\nIt Had to Be You … The Great American Songbook , J-Records, 2002.\nAs Time Goes By … The Great American Songbook, Vol. 2 , J-Records, 2003.\nStardust … The Great American Songbook, Vol. 3 , J-Records, 2004.\nThanks for the Memory … The Great American Songbook, Vol. 4 , J-Records, 2005.\nThe Great American Songbook Box Set , J-Records, 2005.\nStill the Same … Great Rock Classics of Our Time , J-Records, 2006.\nThe Faces\nFirst Step (as the Small Faces), Mercury, 1970.\nLong Player , Mercury, 1971.\nA Nod Is as Good as a Wink … To a Blind Horse , Mercury, 1971.\nOoh La La , Mercury, 1973.\nCoast to Coast: Overture and Beginners , Mercury, 1974.\nJeff Beck Group\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\nRod Stewart's ex-wife Rachel ... The internet goes wild for Bill Clinton's 'crazy hot' model nephew ... Hunter eventually plucked up the courage to leave Stewart. 'Why I had to leave Rod,' by Rachel | Daily Mail Online 'Why I had to leave Rod,' by Rachel | Daily Mail Online\nNext\n'Why I had to leave Rod,' by Rachel\nRod Stewart's ex-wife Rachel Hunter has told of the agony behind her decision to leave her rock star husband because she felt stifled by their eight-year marriage.\nThe New Zealand-born model said she'd become so cosseted by her lavish lifestyle that she didn't have the confidence to do things on her own and felt like she had 'lost her identity'.\n'By the time I was 29 I'd spent eight years with someone else's group of friends. I had no idea what it was like to be a woman with mates of her own to socialise with,' Hunter tells The Mirror.\n'I'd become so cosseted I was too scared to do anything for myself. Like lots of women who marry young and find themselves mothers by the time they're 25, I felt I no longer had an identity. I was just nothing.'\nThe couple met in a Los Angeles nightclub in 1991. Within three weeks Stewart had proposed to Hunter and three months later they were married. Eighteen months after the ceremony their daughter Renee was born followed by son Liam two years later.\nBut Hunter began to feel increasingly stifled by her situation, where everything, even visits to friends, had to be planned by staff and organised in advance.\nAfter communication between the couple had broken down, in December 1998, Hunter eventually plucked up the courage to leave Stewart. 'He was distraught,' she says. ' I'll take to the grave the pain I caused Rod. I hurt the one person I loved and cared about and that's a hard thing to live with on a daily basis.'\nTwo years on, Hunter says she has no regrets and says she remains good friends with Stewart, whom she describes as 'a good man'. 'We speak to each other all the time, and he'll pop round for a cup of tea,' she says.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 8:\n\nRod Stewart admits that his ex-wife Rachel Hunter broke his heart; ... who has been married three times, ...
