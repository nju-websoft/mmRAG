She is widely regarded as one of the most talented and respected actors of the modern era. Streep has received 16 Academy Award nominations, winning two, and 25 Golden Globe nominations, winning seven, more nominations than any other actor in the history of either award. Her work has also earned her two Emmy Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Cannes Film Festival award, four New York Film Critics Circle Awards, five Grammy Award nominations, a BAFTA award, an Australian Film Institute Award and a Tony Award nomination, amongst others. She was awarded the American Film Institute’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004.\nAlan Osmond\nAlan Ralph Osmond (born on June 22, 1949 in Ogden, Utah, United States) was a member of the family musical group The Osmonds. He was the oldest of the seven siblings who could sing, as the two oldest brothers, Virl and Tom, are hearing impaired. During much of the Osmonds’ career, Alan was the leader of the group. Today he performs only rarely because he has multiple sclerosis.\nLindsay Wagner\nLindsay Jean Wagner (born June 22, 1949) is an American actress. She is probably most widely known for her portrayal of Jaime Sommers in the 1970s television series The Bionic Woman (for which she won an Emmy award).\nLinks:\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n... who would be considered the best living actress ... was a supporting actress and didn't exactly carry ...

If Meryl was never born, who would be considered the best living actress alive?\nFollow DL on\nIf Meryl was never born, who would be considered the best living actress alive?\nSadly no American - either an Aussie like Cate Blanchett, or British dames: Judi Dench and Helen Mirren.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 225\nOP, when you say \"best living actress alive,\" do you mean she can't be dead?\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 1\nThe world would be a much better place\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 2\n05/27/2016\nR1 Damn, I meant to either type 'best actress alive' or 'best living actress'. I blame my agent. Anyway, carry on boys!\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 3\n05/27/2016\nCate Blanchett is the star of our times: fine actress on film and stage, great-looking, fun and smart.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 5\n05/27/2016\nBetter question is: who would have landed the most coveted roles that made Meryl iconic: KRAMER VS KRAMER, SOPHIE'S CHOICE, SILKWOOD, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, OUT OF AFRICA, THE DEER HUNTER, THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN, DOUBT?\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 6\nCate Blanchett turned into a caricature of herself faster than any other actress ever has.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 7\nR6 Weaver, Lange, or Close (yes) would have made Silkwood watchable.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 8\nSophie's Choice would have starred Barbra Streisand.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 9\nR9 And she would have won her first Oscar for that.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 10\nThe Devil Wears Prada would have starred Bette Midler.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 11\nMama Mia would have starred Liza Minnelli.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 12\n05/27/2016\nWrong, Cate Blanchett is the only star we have today (then there's Julia Roberts for the masses). Helen Mirren is also a star, but of a different generation.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 13\n05/27/2016\nM ruined Doubt (the elaborate camerawork also contributed). Judi Dench would have been far better in the role.\nThe \"gossip\" speech might be PSH's finest work.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 14\nMeryl's Third Oscar would have gone to Viola Davis.\nMeryl's Second Oscar would have gone to Jessica Lange.\nMeryl's First Oscar would have gone to Candice Bergen.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 15\n05/27/2016\nGena Rowlands, or maybe Ellen Burstyn.\nBlanchett wouldn't exist if Meryl was never born because she mimics Meryl every chance she gets. Or Rowlands if she's feeling adventurous.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 16\n05/27/2016\nWhat happened to Ellen Burstyn? Haven't seen her in any movies since Requiem for a Dream.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 17\nR15 \"Meryl's First Oscar would have gone to Candice Bergen.\"\nWhat? Explain, Lucy!\nCandice is a terrible actress! Ok I've only seen her in Murphy Brown. But still\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 18\n05/27/2016\nI can't think of a single Meryl role in which I wouldn't have preferred another actress. Not that impressed apparently.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 19\nR11 Midler would have killed that role.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 20\nGood \"killed\" or bad, R20?\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 21\n05/27/2016\nR20 Disagree. I think she wouldn't have brought the vulnerability to the role that Meryl as Miranda had. She would have gone full Broadway and camp, whereas the role needed gravity not to turn into a caricature of Anne Wintour.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 22\n05/27/2016\nBarbra Streisand has 4 Best Actress Oscars! More than Meryl.\nBarbra would've won for Klute and Cabaret, in addition to Funny Girl and TWWW, had she not turned them down first. We should acknowledge this and call her a 4-time Best Actress Oscar winner.\nThat makes Streisand the best living actress.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 23\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 24\n05/27/2016\nWho is Jesdica? Also, why does that boy cry every time he wins an award? Is it because he is too short?\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 26\n05/27/2016\nJane Fonda was once a good actress, at least for a few years.  Same with Faye, Diane Keaton, Jodi Foster, and Frances McDormand.\nHonestly, I think Meryl would be in the same category as they are, except that she got incredibly lucky with a comeback of sorts in 2002 with Adaptation and The Hours, which kept her viable enough for The Devil Wears Prada and everything since then. If it hadn't been for her good year in 2002, she'd have been doing low-budget indies and stage work from 1996 on.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 27\n05/27/2016\nCate Blanchett is NOT in the best of all time Catagory. She got some spetacular moment and but she's done now.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 28\n05/27/2016\nR28 Her career is at its peak. I can see her winning third Oscar in next 5-8 years.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 29\n05/28/2016\nI can't believe no one has yet mentioned Vanessa Redgrave.  Even with Meryl in the mix I consider Vanessa to be the greatest living actress.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 30\nI've never said Cate Blanchett was the best of all time. She is the best now.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 34\nI actually love Lynn Redgrave.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 35\n05/28/2016\nMaggie Smith.  Meryl Streep is a film actress who has spent the majority of her career avoiding working with great writers and directors.  For someone supposedly the greatest actress alive, she has certainly avoided playing the great female parts.  Where is her Mary Tyrone?  Clytemnestra?  Lady Macbeth?\nSince the late 80s she has shown such little curiosity and inspiration.  I think she secretly wants to be Diane Keaton.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 36\n05/28/2016\nI'm always surprised that people think Streep is so great. She's made a career of playing mediocre characters in (for the most part) mediocre movies.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 37\n05/28/2016\nNot true. People would not spend all their time here talking about her if that was true. And people spend a LOT of time here talking about Meryl Streep.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 38\nJessica Lange surpasses Streep.  Lange is the best.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 39\n05/28/2016\nThere is no such thing as the best. Jess is good but her TV work is hammy.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 40\n05/28/2016\nCan someone please explain all the acclaim for Helen Mirren? The overwhelming majority of her career has been in British television series, most notably Prime Suspect. That hardly qualifies her as one of the great film actresses. And yes, she was great in The Queen, but other than that, what are her greatest acting triumphs? In what other great and memorable films has she starred? According to IMDb, she was also nominated for Oscars for The Last Station, a move no one saw, as well as Gosford Park, a great film but she was a supporting actress and didn't exactly carry the film, and The Madness of King George, a fine film that few people remember, and of those people even fewer remember her in it.\nSo what exactly is the big deal with this mostly TV actress? Is it because she's British?\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 41\nHelen has done a lot of stage work and has magnificent titties\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 42\n05/28/2016\nIf Meryl was never born, someone else in the 80's may have taken off but we will never know. Streep managed to be popular in every decade, with a few bumps in the road. Most actresses are lucky to have a 5 year run and then it's downhill at 40, no matter how good they are. Maybe Susan Sarandon would have soared. Definitely not Jess. She was never a good movie lead and audiences did not care for her movies.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 43\nJulia Roberts. Julian Moore. Jessica Lang. Juliette Lewis (j/k, she fucks dogs.)\nJJJJ, ya hear?\nJulia Roberts is the greatest actress alive. Meryl dead or alive doesn't come close to Julia.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 46\nR46 Are you posting from 90s? It's all about J Law now.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 47\n05/28/2016\nr47 fuck off, you nasty pig. Julia is a legend, global icon, only female superstar after Liz Taylor. J-Law is just the current flavor going to be forgotten soon like Meg Ryan\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 48\n05/28/2016\nI wonder how many casting couches Meryl has been on. She has talent, no doubt, but come on.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 49\n05/28/2016\nJulia Roberts is not a good actress. Box office in the 90's but never a good actress. Now she is pushing 50 and over.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 50\nR49 Contrary to your wild fantasies, not every actress has slept for roles.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 51\n05/28/2016\nMeryl is so talented that even if she wasn't born she would still be better than 99% of the actresses out there today.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 52\nR51, no, I wasn't talking about all of them, just Meryl \"Couch surfer\" Streep.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 53\nIf Meryl were born black, which actress would she be? I say Lena Horne\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 54\n05/28/2016\nIsabelle Huppert is already the best living actress. But Meryl is a close third (Jeanne Moreau is still alive).\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 55\n05/28/2016\nIsabelle Huppert is not the best living actress. She is fascinating and makes interesting and bold choices career-wise, but as far as acting ability goes, is very limited.\nDenis Lavant (male) is someone who'll make you realise you've never seen someone live out the words before. Saw him at a reading (a reading!!), it was mind-blowing. All the rest are amateurs.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 56\n05/29/2016\nMaggie Smith, hands down. Me and my partner were watching The Lady in the Van, which is not even really a great film, and I asked: \"What is it about Maggie Smith that makes her compelling in anything she does?\" The answer came immediately: \"She is an exceptional actor.\"\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 57\nR57 Maggie Smith only knows how to play a sour-faced, dryly sarcastic English dame.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 58\nI would agree R58. Her range is extremely limited. And she can't do accents.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 59\nIs that even a question? Julianne Moore.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 60\nR62 Like Harry Potter type range ?  LOL\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 63\nYou need to see more movies, R63.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 64\nR64 She did Harry Potter.  That should automatically disqualify her.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 65\n05/30/2016\nJean Brodie was when she was still trying to be to Vanessa Redgrave like, how do I put this delicately, like G is to me.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 66\n05/30/2016\nOP Cate Blanchett is half American. Her father was from Texas. That being said she does some weird US regional accents for someone whose father was American. In essence, she makes some typical mistakes foreign actors who have no American parents make!  Shame on her....\nShe tells a cute story about her American roots and Halloween in Australia on Kimmel though.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 67\nAnd here's a nice picture\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 68\n05/31/2016\nThere's a lot of actresses that could make the list, but only jumped the shark by heading into genres they were shit at.\nAngela Bassett, Halle Berry, Stockard Channing, Kathleen Turner, come immediately to mind...\ngiven time and more work Emma Watson could jump forward.\nbut on the more practical side, I suppose Mary-Louise Parker... even if all her characters look like a deer trapped in the headlights.\nand while personally, I'm about as much of a fan of Patti LuPone as I am of Meryl Streep, not even Sarah Brightman with her nails on chalkboard shrill voice and those decades of straddling Webber's horsecock could wrestle broadway, off broadway, off off broadway from LuPone.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 69\n05/31/2016\nR69 Your post was okay till you mentioned Emma Watson. She has no talent, neither charisma.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 70\n05/31/2016\n[quote]Isabelle Huppert is not the best living actress. She is fascinating and makes interesting and bold choices career-wise, but as far as acting ability goes, is very limited.\nBollocks. Isabelle Huppert can emote any human expression. She can read me the phone book any day of the week and she'll have you on the brink of tears.\nToni Colette is/was exceptional too.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 71\nBlanchette is terribly overrated, Judi Dench acted circles around her in Notes of a Scandal.\nBoth Blanchette and Streep are mainstream actresses for the masses. Blah\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 72\n05/31/2016\nR70 I think you're describing her personality rather than her acting ability.\nr71 Toni Colette, I think.. falls into a category with Tilda Swinton... something beyond mere actresses... putting them in the category of Meryl, is like putting them in the same category as The Rock\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 73\n05/31/2016\nR71, Huppert may well be able to express any number of expressions, she still plays the same character over and over and over again.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 74\n05/31/2016\nR73 What 'acting abilities'? You truly believe she's a gifted actress? Have you seen her movies?\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 75\n05/31/2016\nCate Blanchett is our most versatile, beautiful and eminently watchable leading lady! I adore her feline beauty.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 76\n05/31/2016\nAlso Noomi Rapace, Lupita N'yongo and Charlize Theron. Love them, too.\nCannot stand Emma Watson, Keira Knightly (so wooden), Gwyneth Paltrow and Blythe Danner (hippy-dippy smug) nor Lens Dunham, for what its worth.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 77\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 81\n05/31/2016\nr75 compared to other lasses in her age range, and given her looks, her charms and yes, having more skill. I think she could fall into a Ally Sheedy/Winona Ryder/Jena Malone category. . . she fulfills a certain niche, if she was a stock, I'd be investing in her. I see long term powerbitch in her future. I think the primary reason the crowd is against her is because of the he for she shit, that was just more a naive balancing act to the current media trends than the insufferable shit that ms. dunham exploits (and others) that revved everyone up into a frenzy to paint them as all one in the same.\nOr maybe that she's less likely to be\n\"Well, see, the trouble with you is you're not giving me anything. You know, if you want something from the tabs, you gotta give 'em something back. You're just kinda flatlining nice and sweet, are you? And they want a little bit of a heartbeat. They don't wanna know your mum's your best friend, do they? They want it to be some one-armed, lesbian assailant seeker! They want the full cellulite shots! They want a forty-in-the-bed party with your Harry Potter mates! They want your main lining, arm-jacking, smack-crack nightmare, darling! They want you fileted all over the butcher's block so they can photograph all your organs for \"Heat\" magazine! I mean, frankly, for once, I would like to see you foaming at the mouth, stinking of piss in the gutter with this little thumb stuck up Matthew Lewis's ass and you wearing nothing but a Gucci belt! \"\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 82\n05/31/2016\nThe actress who lost the most with the ascendance of Streep was Annette O'Toole. They were visually similar when young and both had critical support. But they were sort of twins and Steeep probably had more ambition.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 83\n05/31/2016\nR81...LOVE Juliette Binoche.  She is indeed amazing.  She doesn't seem to have the discipline of the English stage actresses, but she is so alive onscreen.  When I think of Meryl Streep's career and find it wanting, it's because I've compared her to Maggie Smith/Judi Dench/Vanessa Redgrave/Helen Mirren...who besides working in film also committed themselves to the stage and tackled some of THE great roles.  Meryl just hasn't done that.  She has not thrown down her Mary Tyrone, her Blanche DuBois, her Antigone, her Nora, her Cleopatra.\nBut I also think of Juliette Binoche, who has largely forsaken Hollywood and has worked with the great directors of our time.  She has shown courage in a way that Meryl Streep hasn't.  Meryl has been considered one of the greatest actresses alive for 30+ years.  She could work with anyone she wanted.  In any medium.  And yet, time after time she chooses to work with mediocre talent in mediocre films.  But, hey, she keeps getting nominated and winning Oscars...\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 84\n05/31/2016\nLindsay Wagner was born on the same day as Meryl, and is Meryl's spiritual twin.\nIf Meryl hadn't been born, the cosmos would have gifted all of M's talent's to Lindsay, and she would have (at least) 2 Oscars - one for her Supporting turn in \"The Paper Chase\" and the 2nd for \"The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story\" - yes, I know that was made for TV, but it would have been a film with Lindsey's clout as Best Living Actress.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 85\nAnd yet people talk about Meryl incessantly.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 86\nR85, I would have loved to have seen M as The Bionic Woman.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 87\n05/31/2016\nI get the sense Streep is interested in creating her own characters. I also think it would be great if Scorsese, Spielberg, etc. did more movies about women. It's easy to second guess her choices but clearly she is an ongoing DL obsession.\nI forgot about Lindsay Wagner. I loved that show.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 88\n05/31/2016\nI like r6's game. Who'd have got the roles if there was no Meryl?\nKramer Versus Kramer-maybe Jobeth Williams. Meryl auditioned for that smaller role in the film first but then when Kate Jackson was unavailable she moved up to the bigger part. Maybe Jobeth would have too.\nSophie's Choice-that Polish actress who was second choice\nSilkwood-Diane Keaton - she was branching out from Woody Allen and Warren Beatty around then so she could have had it-----or maybe Debra Winger\nOut of Africa- Kate Nelligan\nDevil Wears Prada-hard to think of another actress that age who was big at the time. (Glenn and Jess were sort of low profile in films in 2006) Maybe Cate or Catherine Zeta-Jones or even Mrs. Gwyneth if any of them had been willing to look older.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 90\nr23, Barbra Streisand did not win an Oscar for TWWW.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 91\n05/31/2016\nThe well-known fact that she \"chooses to work with mediocre talent in mediocre films\" plays a large role in my not being a fan of M. When she does a shitfest like Mamma Mia, knowing full well what the????? I'm off the boat. And it's been that way for the past 20 years or so.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 92\nMama Mia was her biggest box office hit ever.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 93\n05/31/2016\nCherry Jones should have been offered the role in the film 'Doubt' not Streep. She did win the Tony award...\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 94\n05/31/2016\nI remember that Susan Lucci wanted her \"Out of Africa.\" That movie would have been better with Meryl and Timothy Dalton. I did like Meryl with Klaus. A Kate Mulgrew would be good.\nI am not convinced Kramer would have worked with Kate Jackson. Maybe Lindsay Wagner.\nSharon Stone would be fun for Prada.\nThey could remake Sophie with Saoirse.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 95\n05/31/2016\nThe Kramer character was totally different when Kate Jackson was attached. She was just spoiled rich girl who wanted to play tennis and thought child care was boring.\nThe writers and directors let Meryl make her more sympathetic and troubled.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 96\nThe weird thing about Kramer Versus Kramer is no one ever thinks of joint custody.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 97\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 101\n06/01/2016\nPeople seem to be taking Momma Mia! way too seriously. It made millions of people happy, just like Grease.\nDoes anyone think Jennifer Lawrence will be as successful, or is Cate Blanchett the heir apparent?\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 102\n06/01/2016\nKate Winslet has had some rocky years. How could she not given the heights her career climbed, but I'll say it now, she's a far more gifted actress than Blanchett.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 103\n06/01/2016\nSharon Stone in Prada? Yeah and it would premiere on encore 4yrs after it filmed and the Anne role would have been played by Bijou Phillips or some shit. Busy Phillips lol\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 104\nI agree that Toni Collette is a gifted actress. Japanese Story..\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 105\nI would cast Kirsten Dunst in some of Meryl's earlier roles.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 106\nSpeaking of which, la Julianne is hilarious in Maggie's Plan.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 107\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 108\n06/01/2016\nIf Meryl was never born does that mean that Mr. Potter would have taken over all of Bedford Falls and turned it into Pottersville?\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 109\n06/01/2016\nIt's highly subjective but my short list of contenders would be Judy Davis, Tilda Swinton, Julianne Moore, Catherine Deneuve and Vanessa Redgrave.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 110\n06/01/2016\nIn the past 10 years, Meryl has worked with Robert Altman, Jonathan Demme and Stephen Frears.  Such mediocre talent.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 111\nNo one comes close to Julia Roberts. No one.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 112\n06/01/2016\nR90 I like your suggestions but remind me, who was the Polish actress who was considered the second choice?\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 113\n06/01/2016\nR82 You are delusional. Brie Larson, Alicia Vikander, Saoirse Ronan, JLaw, Emma Stone - all who are in Emma Watson's age range - are far more talented, skilled and charismatic than basic Emma Watson.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 114\n06/01/2016\nYeah Emma Watson sucks and she's not cute, or sexy, or intelligent, or damaged... She's nothing on screen basically\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 115\n06/01/2016\nFuck Cate Blanchett- Arch, Dykish, Arrogant, so pleased with herself. She isn't half the gifted, spirited actress that Kate Winslet can be. And frankly I'm sick of people saying Blanchett is everything when I can barely stomach her in most of what she does, sometimes she's bizarrely fascinating, but NEVER likable. I'd really like to see more from these younger, gifted actresses. Michelle Williams, Brie Larson, Abbie Cornish or Kiki Dunst after what they did in Bright Star and Melancholia. Jlaw ravaged by Aronofsky's lens. Fuck that smug elvish bitch Ham Blanchett\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 116\n06/01/2016\nR115 You described yourself there. Emma is young, pretty talented  and I'm sure she's going to be a big actress.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 117\nCan Cate Blanchett be Queen if she is Australian? I thought the rules prevent felons.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 118\n06/01/2016\nSusan Lucci also publically stated that she wanted M's role in Bridges of Madison County, r95.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 119\nBrie Larson wants to be a big player.\nJennifer Lawrence wants to be ?\nI still am waiting for Sandra to follow up and pivot. She has so much carte Blanche but seems stuck.\nCharlize could be great but will probably end up on TV.\nEmma's are good.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 120\n06/02/2016\nI agree that Winslet is better than Blanchett when she takes risks. God knows what she/her agents have been doing for the last few years. I'm completely burned out on  Lawrence at the moment.\nWe'd probably be talking of somebody like Maggie Smith or Judy Davis as the greatest living actress if Meryl wasn't around.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 121\n06/03/2016\nI know the Julia fans are trolling, but I actually think Julia out-acted Meryl in August Osage County. Seriously.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 122\n06/03/2016\nMeryl would fold like a tent if she had to do stage. There is a reason she stays away from theater.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 123\n06/03/2016\n[R122] She did. I don't always feel that the criticism that you can always see Streep 'acting' is entirely warranted, but in A:OC it really was.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 124\n06/03/2016\nI love Meryl, but her performance in August: Osage was TERRIBLE.

One of the biggest criticisms I hear on DL about Meryl is that she's never been in a memorable film or a blockbuster. I would dispute that, but that's another topic. To all the Jessica worshippers, what are her memorable, lasting films? Her resume is even less impressive than Meryl's based on that criteria. DLers often mention her performance in Frances, but I would say that Frances is even more forgotten than Sophie's Choice. Tootsie? Sure, but she was supporting cast. That was Hoffman's film. What else? There's not much there if you really look. So she's done Broadway, but except for her current Long Day's Journey Into Night, not an otherwise impressive Broadway resume. The only thing she has over Meryl is television, so I guess she and Glenn can fight it over over who is the reigning Failed Movie Queen Who Tried Their Luck At Television. Meryl has no dog in that fight, except for the Emmy and Golden Globe awards she's got for the few times she's crossed over to the small screen.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 138\n06/04/2016\nIf Meryl was never born, her parts might have been taken by Blythe Danner, who got similarly great reviews early in her career.

She hasn't done Broadway since the 1970s, probably because of the grueling schedule and season long commitment. A girl gets bored having to act out the same scenes 7 days a week for 4 to 6 months, particularly if you're a technical actor like Meryl. Jessica is an emotional actor who feeds off the energy of her surroundings. Since the energy is likely to be different each night, each performance may be fresh and different from the night before. Of course, this approach isn't always reliable and can lead to an actor surrendering entirely to his emotions and veering off into OTT territory.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 149\n06/14/2016\nMeryl's Deer Hunter role would have been long-forgotten.\nThe Kramer vs. Kramer role would have stayed as initially written, and whoever played it largely forgotten.

Streep's reputation derives from her fondness for accents and her alleged chameleon quality.  The other major stars of her generation didn't go for that so much, but were more about emotional truth and power.\nWith Streep, it's usually evident that she is \"acting,\" but most critics somehow either don't notice or don't care.  Her contemporaries are most of them a lot less technical.\nR176, Streep is the epitome of cold and uninvolving, except in comedy and in roles where Streeps own  aloofness or coolness meshes with the character's.

Streep is constantly discussed here. If she were cold or uninvolving, she never would have become a movie legend.\nThat depends how you define a legend.  If a legend is someone who stars in legendary, classic movies, then no, Streep is not a legend.  She continues to have no classics where she plays lead (and no, I'm not interested in arguing ths point, because it's a fact that her movies fail to make the critics' Great Film lists). I don't always agree with what's on these lists and what's left off, but it is true that her movies tend to be left off.\nAnd none of her movies were hits that relied on her star power to sell them when she was young.  they were strictly critical hits, they didn't draw the masses at all.  They didn't make money unless they had a big name A list male costar like Dustin Hoffman or Robert Redford.  In her late middle age she did become a bona fide draw, but mostly in comedies like Julie and Julia and The Devil Wears Prada, the latter of which calls on her to play a cold, aloof, chilly woman.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 184\n07/31/2016\n[quote]People who claim Streep is cold should watch her Oscar worthy scene in Devil Wears Prada when Miranda strips down emotionally to AnnE, reveals her fears and passions. No ' tick tick tock' with her there.\nIf that's the best example you can give, I rest my case.  The performance was genuinely entertaining, but hardly moving or sympathy generating.  I felt nothing for her character and she certainly never humanized that woman to any great degree, certainly not when you compare it to what Sigourney Weaver did with a similar character (the abusive boss from hell) in Working Girl.  Weaver really does generate real sympathy for her character, her final humiliation is disturbing to watch, despite never letting you forget what a bully and manipulative bitch she is.

Several prior posts harshly criticized Jessica Lange's acting skills, and in far more insulting terms than I criticized Streep, but you didn't complain about that did you?  This is because you're an entitled fanboy cunt who thinks it's just fine to lambast Lange or any other actress, but woe betide anyone who dares to attack the sacred cow Streep.  Double standards much?\nI was responding to a prior post claiming Lange could not have starred in Bridges  of Madison County because she is \"cold\" in everything.

She has no movies that are generally considered classics or masterpieces where she's the star.  That is inarguable.  I've consulted many, many, many different Greatest Films lists over the years to help me fill in the gaps in my knowledge and her movies don't appear on any of them, except ones like Manhattan where she has very little screentime.  This has nothing to do with my personal biases, it's an objective fact.  I don't always agree with the choices and some movies that are always there I think are overrated and movies I think belong may be absent.  That's irrelevant.  I am stating what the reality is.\nYou might see something like Out of Africa listed at #992 or something.

You may not like the idea of mixing Hollywood with foreign language films, but that's what these lists do, so someone like Liv Ullmann has numerous titles high up on these lists where she has starring roles, not just a cameo like Streep in Manhattan.  Shirley MacLaine has The Apartment and Being There.  Sissy Spacek, Julianne Moore, and Sigourney Weaver have titles.  There are others.\n[quote]But people know and talk about her movies all the time. Especially here. From Kramer to Angels in America to Silkwood to The Devil Wears Prada. Have a nice day.\nNo they don't.  Nobody talks about those movies the way they talk about Casablanca or GoodFellas or Lawrence of Arabia or even The Last Picture Show or Silence of the Lambs.  If you were to talk about Dustin Hoffman, for example, The Graduate, Midnight Cowboy, All the Presidents Men, Tootsie, and Rain Man, all get discussed and remembered far more than KvK.\nPeople talk about her all the time if the are Oscar trivia buffs and awards obsessives.  That has little to do with how critics, academics, and filmmakers evaluate her movies as overall achievements.  They may think they are good movies, but not enough to consider them worthy of inclusion in the film canon.\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 191\nby The Ghost of Geraldine Pag\nreply 192\n07/31/2016\nCompared to KvK, yes, it gets talked about more.

Like I said, I don't always agree with the choices that are in the canon or how they get ranked (I would not put Citizen Kane #1 no matter how technically brilliant it is), but that is the reality.\nAnd how can you claim her films will be discussed for decades when they already aren't discussed that much now?

You are underestimating her influence because you are jealous of her success.\nThat's just playing the PR game and status signalling.  If anyone disliked Streep's acting, they would never say so because the one thing you never ever do in Hollywood is badmouth a big star.  That's sacrilege.   Saying you admire Streep is shorthand to indicate you're a serious actress and want to be offered the great roles.  The only acceptable attitude to Streep in Hollywood is to gush over her alleged genius.\nMeanwhile, if you observe what Jennifer Lawrence DOES instead of what she SAYS, she was obviously busy stealing ideas and mannerisms from Gena Rowlands for American Hustle.  Not Streep.  When interviewers set aside their preconceptions and allow actors to answer freely, stop trying to force feed Streep, the answers are different.  Rachel McAdams turns out to be a huge fan of Elizabeth Taylor.  Sarah Paulson turns out to adore Jessica Lange.  Jessica Lange turns out to have idolized Kim Stanley and doesn't even have a favorite Streep performance.  Jessica Chastain turns out to be sick and tired of seeing Streep in everything and would rather see other people get cast.  Gena Rowlands turns out to be one of those hidden influences that was much more impactful on the acting community than on the general public.  And so forth.\nYou can tell when someone is sincere and when they're just status signalling.   McAdams on Taylor, Paulson on Lange, Lange on Stanley, that's where you see who they really love and who their real favorites are.  Just as you can tell who directors truly admire and want to collaborate with by who they pursue for their passion projects, not by who they say nice things about in the press.

The daughter of an actress and the granddaughter of a high-ranking politician, Lansbury studied acting from her youth, departing for the United States as the Second World War began. She was contracted by MGM while still a teenager and nominated for an Academy Award for her first film, Gaslight (1944). Two pictures later, she was again nominated for Best Supporting Actress, this time for The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945). Now established as a supporting player of quality, she began a long career, often as \"the other woman\" in major productions and as the leading lady in lesser films. Her features, while not at all old-appearing, gave her an air of maturity that allowed her to pass as much older than she actually was, and she began playing mother roles, often to players of her own age, while yet in her thirties. She concentrated more and more on stage work, achieving notable success in a number of Broadway plays and musicals, winning four Tony Awards in sixteen years. Although active in television since the early 1950s, she obtained her greatest fame in the 1980s by starring in the light mystery program Murder, She Wrote (1984). As Jessica Fletcher, she became known and loved by millions for well over a decade. She also became known for the odd fact of almost annual Emmy Award nominations for the role without ever winning for it. An institution in American theatre and television, she is also an inspiration for the graciousness of her personality, which is often exploited and always admired.\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>\nSpouse (2)\nDeep sultry voice.\nTrivia (70)\nDaughter of actress Moyna MacGill , who appeared with her in The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945) and Kind Lady (1951).\nGranddaughter of George Lansbury, British Labour Party leader in 1930s.\nSister of Edgar Lansbury and Bruce Lansbury , and half-sister of Isolde Denham.\nWearing just conventional makeup (i.e., not studio made-up to look \"old\"), she was most chilling and unforgettable (and convincing!) as the manipulating mother of Laurence Harvey in The Manchurian Candidate (1962), while in real life being scarcely three years Harvey's senior.\nShe, her mother Moyna MacGill and her twin younger brothers were in the last boatload of family members evacuated from London to America during World War II.\nA recent authorized biography, \"Balancing Act\", states that her first husband, Richard Cromwell was gay, a fact she didn't know until after their separation.\nShe was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 1994 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her services to drama.\nHer daughter was a follower of Charles Manson 's gang.

I know they've had problems of their own, but we have never wavered in our closeness as a family. I've had a hell of a life.\nI just stopped playing bitches on wheels and peoples' mothers. I have only a few more years to kick up my heels!\n[on working with the choir, the first time] I felt extremely nervous. I felt I was working with a group of people who are so wonderfully integrated among themselves to produce wonderful sound, music, singing\ntheir voices are so pure, so clear. I've listened so much to them in\nthe past to be singing down with them, I was very nervous.\nI'm never left behind. I'm the bionic woman.\nProviding I can put one foot in front of the other, I will continue to act.\nIt has been erroneously reported that I am a Republican! I am not a Republican. It's all over the Internet and It's bizarre. I'm a huge Obama fan. I've already voted for him by absentee ballot. I am Democrat from the ground up.\n[on handling the early success and Oscar nominations while still being in her teens] I was a very serious teenager at that time and I considered the work to be the most important thing and I concentrated on that. I was a bit goody goody. I didn't fool around at all, which is a bit of a shame, I think. I've missed on a lot of fun, but I've made up for it later [laughs].\n[Advice to aspiring actors] I really can't honestly give any tips beyond hang on to your dream. Hang on to what you want, what you feel you want to achieve and go for it. We are all the victims of our own talent and our own shortcomings sometimes, and we have to be aware of those things because they will trip us up and stop us from achieving what our aims are.\nWork in the theatre just keeps revitalizing me, it keeps giving me the excitement and the fun of something new coming up and that's a great gift.\n[2013] I absolutely do not have a retirement age... I'm only 87 - which today is nothing. It's just like 60 a few years back. I believe age should not stop you from keeping on.\n[on the desire to perform until the very end] My son said to me \"Mom, honestly, the best thing for you would be to keep working and just go out on stage.\" and I think that's a good thing to aim for.\n[on what make her going at the age of 87] I rest, I take a nap, I don't eat stupidly, I take care of the bod and that's very, very important when you get to a certain age. I'm the bionic woman; I've got knees, hips, everything is new and that has made a tremendous difference to me; replacements are high on my list of goodies.\n[on the Murder, She Wrote (1984) remake] I think it's a mistake to call it Murder, She Wrote (1984), because Murder, She Wrote (1984) will always be about a Cabot Cove and this wonderful little group of people who told those lovely stories and enjoyed a piece of that place, and also enjoyed Jessica Fletcher, who is a rare and very individual kind of person. So I'm sorry that they have to use the title Murder, She Wrote (1984), even though they have access to it and it's their right.\n[on being awarded British Damehood] I'm joining a marvelous group of women I greatly admire like Judi Dench and Maggie Smith . It's a lovely thing to be given that nod of approval by your own country and I really cherish it.\nChildren in our business suffer from exposure. Mine did because I was Broadway star. And my children's generation was the first to be confused by reality, The Sixties was a bad time to find yourself.\n[on Bette Davis ] She is an original. There has never been anyone, before or since, who could touch her.\n[speaking in 2015 about reprising her Murder, She Wrote (1984) character Jessica Fletcher] I think it would be a downer. In some way, we'd have to show her as a much older woman, and I think it's better to maintain that picture we have in our mind's eye of her as a vigorous person. I'm still pretty vigorous, especially in the garden ... but if I wanted to transform myself back into the woman I looked like then, it would be ridiculous. And I can't do that.\nSalary (3)\n\n"
