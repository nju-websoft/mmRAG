Frequently Asked Questions about Snow Crystals Frequently Asked Questions about Snow Crystals\n   ... Things you always wanted to know about snow crystals ...\nWhy do snow crystals form in          such complex and symmetrical shapes?\n   To see why snowflakes look like they do, consider the life history of a          single snow crystal, as shown in the diagram at right.  (Click on          the picture for a larger view.)\n   The story begins up in a cloud, when a minute cloud droplet first          freezes into a tiny particle of ice.  As water vapor starts          condensing on its surface, the ice particle quickly develops facets , thus becoming a small hexagonal prism .  For a while it keeps this simple faceted          shape as it grows.\n   As the crystal becomes larger, however, branches begin to sprout from the six corners of the hexagon (this          is the third stage in the diagram at right).  Since the atmospheric          conditions (e. g. temperature and humidity) are nearly constant across          the small crystal, the six budding arms all grow out at roughly the same          rate.\n   While it grows, the crystal is blown to and fro inside the clouds,          so the temperature it sees changes randomly with time.  But the          crystal growth depends strongly on temperature (as is seen in the morphology         diagram ).  Thus the six arms of the snow crystal each change their growth with         time.  And because all six arms         see the same conditions at the same times, they all grow about the same way.  The end result is a complex, branched structure that is also six-fold          symmetric.  And note also that since snow crystals all follow slightly          different paths through the clouds, individual crystals all tend to          look different.\n   The story is          pretty simple, really, nicely encapsulated in the diagram above.  And it's even a bit amazing, when you stop to ponder it -- the whole          complex, beautiful, symmetrical structure of a snow crystal simply          arises spontaneously, quite literally out of thin air, as it tumbles          through the clouds.  What synchronizes the growth          of the six arms?\n   Nothing.  The six arms of a snow crystal all grow independently, as          described in the previous section.  But since they grow under the          same randomly changing conditions, all six end up with similar shapes.\n   If you think this is hard to swallow, let me assure you that the vast majority of snow crystals are not very symmetrical.  Don't be fooled by the pictures -- irregular crystals (see the Guide to Snowflakes ) are by far the most common type.  If you          don't believe me, just take a look          for yourself next time it snows.  Near-perfect, symmetrical snow          crystals are fun to look at, but they are not common. Why do snow crystals have          six arms?    The six-fold symmetry          of a snow crystal ultimately derives from the hexagonal geometry of the ice crystal lattice .  But the lattice has molecular dimensions,          so it's not trivial how this nano-scale symmetry is transferred to the          structure of a large snow crystal.\n   The way it works is through faceting .  No long-range forces are necessary to form facets;          they appear simply because of how the molecules hook up locally in the          lattice (see Crystal Faceting for how this works).  From faceting we get hexagonal prisms , which are large structures with six-fold symmetry.  Eventually arms sprout from the corners of a prism, and six corners          means six arms.\n   Faceting is how the geometry of the water molecule is transferred          to the geometry of a large snow crystal. Why is snow white?\n   No, it's not a white dye.  Snow is made of  ice crystals, and          up close the individual crystals look clear, like glass.  A large          pile of snow crystals looks white for the same reason a pile of crushed          glass looks white.  Incident light is partially reflected by an ice          surface, again just as it is from a glass surface.  When you have a lot of partially reflecting surfaces, which you do in a snow bank,          then incident light bounces around and eventually scatters back out.  Since all colors are scattered roughly equally well, the snow bank          appears white.\n   In fact, the ice does absorbs some light while it's bouncing around,          and red light is absorbed more readily than blue light.  Thus, if          you look inside a snow bank you can sometimes see a blue color.  I          took a few pictures of this once in the California mountains . Is it ever too cold to snow?    In principle it can          snow at any temperature below freezing.  It snows at the South Pole          even though the temperature is rarely above -40 C (-40 F). \n   In more hospitable climates, however, it doesn't snow so much when          the temperature is below around -20 C (-4 F).  When a parcel of          moist air cools, it starts producing snow before it gets that cold.  By the time the temperature drops to -20 C, the snow has already fallen          and the air is pretty dry.  The clouds that remain are made of ice          crystals, and these don't produce much snow (see the Snowflake Primer for how clouds make snow). Why study the physics of snowflakes? There are several good reasons for          studying how snowflakes form.\n   First of all, crystals are useful in all sorts of applications, and we would like to know how to          grow them better. Computers are carved out of silicon          wafers, which in turn are cut from large silicon crystals.  Many          other semiconductor crystals are used for other electronics          applications.  Lasers are also made from          crystals, and a variety of optical crystals are used extensively in          telecommunications. Artificial diamond crystals are used in machining          and grinding.  The list of industrial crystals is actually quite          long.\n   By studying the physics of snowflakes, we learn about how molecules          condense to form crystals.  This basic knowledge applies to other          materials as well.  As we learn more about the physics and chemistry          of how crystals grow, maybe  someday  we can use          that knowledge to help fabricate new and better types of crystalline          materials.\n   This is the way that basic science becomes useful -- figure out how          things work the best you can, and later on use that knowledge in          unforeseen applications. \n   Another good reason to study          snowflakes is to better understand structure formation and          self-assembly. Humans usually make a thing by starting with a block of          material and carving from it.  Computers, for example, are made by          patterning intricate circuits on silicon wafers.\n   Nature uses a completely different approach to manufacturing. In          nature, things simply assemble themselves. Cells grow and divide,          forming complex organisms. Even extremely sophisticated computers (such          as your          brain) arise from self-assembly.  Your DNA does not contain nearly          enough information to guide the placement of every cell in your body.  Most of that structure simply arises spontaneously as you grow, following poorly          understood rules.  Biological self-assembly is an extremely complex process, and we do not understand much about how it works at a          fundamental level.\n   The snowflake is an very simple example of self-assembly. There is          no blueprint or genetic code that guides the growth of a snowflake, yet          marvelously complex structures appear, quite literally out of thin air.          As we understand better how snowflakes form, we learn about          self-assembly.  As the electronics industry pushes toward ever          smaller devices, it is likely that self-assembly will play an          increasingly important role in manufacturing.  Learning about          self-assembly from the ground up will probably by useful in this context          also.  Again, in the study of basic science we try to solve the          easy problems first (like snowflakes), and later use that knowledge to          develop engineering applications we cannot yet foresee.\n   History has shown over and over that the fundamental knowledge          gained by doing basic science (without worrying about what it's good          for) often leads to useful engineering applications.  There is a          great deal of          interesting physics, chemistry, and materials science wrapped up in          snowflake growth, and studying the lowly snowflake may indeed teach us          something useful.\n   Now, all that being said, my personal motivation is not from potential          practical applications.  I am not trying to make better artificial          snow, better ice for Olympic skating, bigger diamonds, faster computers,          or anything like that.  I believe that basic science can and should be pursued for its own          sake.  Scientists try to understand everything they can about how          nature works, on the premise that all knowledge is potentially useful.  Einstein didn't worry about the practical applications of relativity --          he just wanted to understand how nature worked.  Maxwell didn't          think about cell phone technology when he worked out the laws of electromagnetism --          he just wanted to understand how nature worked.\n   I want to figure out the underlying physics of snowflake growth          because this is an interesting puzzle in molecular dynamics.  I would like to understand the fundamental physics of how molecules jostle into          place to form a crystal.  How fast does this happen?  How does it          change with temperature? What happens if there are chemical impurities          on the ice surface?  There are many such questions, and ice is an          interesting case study in crystal growth.  These remarkable          structures simply fall from the sky -- we ought to understand how they          are formed!  With over six billion people on the          planet, surely a few of us can be spared to ponder the subtle mysteries          of snowflakes.  Who else is working on the          science of snow crystals?    Not many people are          thinking about why snow crystals look like they do, and most of them are          meteorologists looking at how snow crystal formation affects the          properties of cold clouds.  Here is a partial list (in no          particular order), along with contact information (in the links):\nCharles          Knight , National Center for Atmospheric Research\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n5 Common Dreams and What They ... Why are snowflakes symmetrical (same on all sides)? ... The short answer is that snowflakes have so many light ... Snowflake Chemistry (Common Snowflake Questions) Snowflake Chemistry (Common Snowflake Questions)\nBy Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D.\nHave you ever looked at a snowflake and wondered how it formed or why it looks different from other snow you might have seen? Snowflakes are a particular form of water ice. Snowflakes form in clouds, which consist of water vapor . When the temperature is 32° F (0° C) or colder, water changes from its liquid form into ice. Several factors affect snowflake formation. Temperature, air currents, and humidity all influence shape and size. Dirt and dust particles can get mixed up in the water and affect crystal weight and durability. The dirt particles make the snowflake heavier, and can cause cracks and breaks in the crystal and make it easier to melt. Snowflake formation is a dynamic process. A snowflake may encounter many different environmental conditions, sometimes melting it, sometimes causing growth, always changing its structure.\nGenerally, six-sided hexagonal crystals are shaped in high clouds; needles or flat six-sided crystals are shaped in middle height clouds; and a wide variety of six-sided shapes are formed in low clouds.\ncontinue reading below our video\nWhat are the Seven Wonders of the World\nColder temperatures produce snowflakes with sharper tips on the sides of the crystals and may lead to branching of the snowflake arms (dendrites). Snowflakes that grow under warmer conditions grow more slowly, resulting in smoother, less intricate shapes.\n32-25° F - Thin hexagonal plates\n25-21° F - Needles\n14-10° F - Sector plates (hexagons with indentations)\n10-3° F - Dendrites (lacy hexagonal shapes)\nWhy are snowflakes symmetrical (same on all sides)?\nFirst, not all snowflakes are the same on all sides. Uneven temperatures, presence of dirt, and other factors may cause a snowflake to be lop-sided. Yet it is true that many snowflakes are symmetrical and intricate. This is because a snowflake's shape reflects the internal order of the water molecules. Water molecules in the solid state, such as in ice and snow, form weak bonds (called hydrogen bonds ) with one another. These ordered arrangements result in the symmetrical, hexagonal shape of the snowflake. During crystallization, the water molecules align themselves to maximize attractive forces and minimize repulsive forces. Consequently, water molecules arrange themselves in predetermined spaces and in a specific arrangement. Water molecules simply arrange themselves to fit the spaces and maintain symmetry.\nIs it true that no two snowflakes are identical?\nYes and no. No two snowflakes are exactly identical, down to the precise number of water molecules, spin of electrons , isotope abundance of hydrogen and oxygen, etc. On the other hand, it is possible for two snowflakes to look exactly alike and any given snowflake probably has had a good match at some point in history. Since so many factors affect the structure of a snowflake and since a snowflake's structure is constantly changing in response to environmental conditions, it is improbable that anyone would see two identical snowflakes.\nIf water and ice are clear, then why does snow look white?\nThe short answer is that snowflakes have so many light-reflecting surfaces they scatter the light into all of its colors, so snow appears white . The longer answer has to do with the way the human eye perceives color. Even though the light source might not be truly 'white' light (e.g., sunlight, fluorescent, and incandescent all have a particular color), the human brain compensates for a light source. Thus, even though sunlight is yellow and scattered light from snow is yellow, the brain sees snow as white because the whole picture received by the brain has a yellow tint that is automatically subtracted.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nSnowCrystals.com: Photos ..

The Adobe Reader is available for free .\nAll of Aunt Annie's project patterns are designed to be printed on standard letter size paper (8.5\"x11\" or A4).    When printing from Adobe Reader, you may need to select \"Auto-Rotate and Center\" or \"Choose paper source by PDF page size\" to ensure the best fit.\nStep 2: Cut a Square\nCut on the square outline. Try to make your cuts very straight, and the corners square.\nAll paper snowflakes start with a square sheet of paper. The large snowflakes in this project use an 8\"     (20 cm) square; the medium ones are based on a 6\" (15 cm) square, and the small ones on a 3½\" (9 cm) square. If you don't need the fold lines, just cut a square of the right size to use with     one of the cutting patterns. If you plan to make a snowflake of your own design, any size square will work fine.\nStep 3: Fold in Half Twice\nFold the square in half on the diagonal, and then fold it in half     again on the other diagonal.\nKeep the fold marks on the outside of the fold.\nAfter these two folds, you will have a right isosceles triangle. That is, one angle     of the triangle is 90° (right), and two to its sides are equal in length.\nStep 4: Fold in Thirds\nWith the right angle pointing up, fold the triangle in thirds. Fold one side over, then fold the other side over on top of it. Keep the fold marks on the outside of the fold.\nStep 5: Trim\nTrim the corners off to make a triangle. If you open the folded paper now, you'll have a twelve-sided polygon.\nStep 6: Draw Snowflake Pattern\nSkip this step if you are making one of the simple snowflakes.\nWith a pencil, draw a pattern for your snowflake on the folded triangle. You can either cut out and trace one of the cutting patterns from this project,    or make a design of your own.\nThe center of the snowflake is the point of the triangle (smallest angle). The points of the snowflake are the other two corners.     Cut off one of the corners to make a six pointed snowflake.\nStep 7: Cut and Unfold\nCut on the pattern lines. Be sure to cut straight. Erase any pencil line marks remaining. Now carefully unfold the paper to see the     beautiful snowflake you made.\nKids, if you have trouble making the cuts, ask an adult for help. You may need a sharper pair of scissors.\nWhere will you display your     snowflakes?\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nWhy Are Snowflakes Always Six-Sided? ... all snowflakes have six sides, ... without understanding why water molecules are arranged like they are. Why Are Snowflakes Always Six-Sided? - DoubleXScience Why Are Snowflakes Always Six-Sided? - DoubleXScience\nWhy Are Snowflakes Always Six-Sided?\nPosted on\nby Matthew R Francis\n(Today’s offering is a guest post by engineer Linda Gaines .)\nIt’s a well-known fact that all snowflakes have six sides. Or at least I thought it was. Why Google is unable to Google that fact and has on at least two occasions created a Doodle with an eight-sided snowflake is a mystery. What’s less mysterious is how scientists can be so sure that all snowflakes have six sides. Have we examined all snowflakes? No, of course not, but the explanation lies in two words: hydrogen bonding. Thanks to the intermolecular force of hydrogen bonding, all snowflakes have six sides, and hydrogen bonding also makes life as we know it possible. Now that’s an important bond.\nYou can’t really understand hydrogen bonding, though, without understanding why water molecules are arranged like they are. Water seems like a simple enough molecule. It consists of one oxygen atom with two hydrogen atoms bonded to it. The hydrogen atoms bond to the oxygen atom at a distance of exactly 104.5 degrees from each other (1). Why that particular angle?\nAn oxygen atom has a total of eight electrons. Two of them take up all the available spots in the shell closest to the atom’s nucleus. The remaining six electrons are relegated to the atom’s outermost (or valence) electronic shell. But this shell can actually hold eight electrons, so two spots are open. A hydrogen atom has one electron on its only electronic shell, and since that shell holds two electrons, it’s got room for one more.\nBecause oxygen has two available spaces and hydrogen has one, oxygen can share that space with two hydrogen atoms. Both hydrogen atoms share their single electron with the oxygen, and the oxygen shares an electrons with each of the hydrogen atoms. The remaining four of the oxygen’s electrons aren’t a part of this sharing arrangement, though. Electrons kick around in pairs, so these four non-sharing electrons form two pairs.\nWith these two pairs sitting alone and the other two electrons each sharing with a hydrogen, a water molecule has a tetrahedron (or three-sided pyramid) shape with four attachments emerging from the oxygen nucleus. Two of those attachments are electron clouds containing two electrons each (the pairs), and the other two attachments are hydrogen atoms with two electrons moving between the oxygen and hydrogen orbits. In a true tetrahedron, the attachments would all be 109.5 degrees from each other. With the water molecule, though, the hydrogen atoms are 104.5 degrees from each other because the two paired-electron clouds are grabby with space and force the electrons shared with the hydrogen atoms a little closer together.\nSo we’ve learned that the hydrogen and oxygen form a covalent bond, which means they share their electrons. What I haven’t told you is that the oxygen is very grabby with that electron, so the sharing isn’t exactly equal. The oxygen has a stronger hold on the electron and is pulling that negative charge closer to it and away from the hydrogens. What results is a slightly negative oxygen and slightly positive hydrogens. The oxygen actually has two areas of negativity, right across from where it’s bonded with each hydrogen. Water molecules can use these areas of slight charge to form a fairly strong bond with other molecules, a bond called a hydrogen bond . While not every molecule containing hydrogen can form this kind of bond with other molecules, molecules in which hydrogen is in this unequal sharing situation will be able to.\nIn the case of water molecules bonding to other water molecules, the two slightly negative areas of the oxygen can each bond with a slightly positive hydrogen from another water molecule. When all four slightly charged areas have each bonded with another water molecule via hydrogen bonding, the result is a tetrahedral (four-sided pyramid) shape.\nThese bonds make water an unusual substance. When the temperature drops and water starts to solidify, the hydrogen bonding becomes very important. The hydrogen bonding dictates the shape of the ice crystals. You’ve learned that each water molecule is linked to four other water molecules in a tetrahedral arrangement. \nAs the water freezes, these tetrahedrons come closer together and crystallize into a six-ring or hexagonal structure. Look at the image to see how this happens. Each point on the hexagon is an oxygen atom, and each side is a hydrogen bonded to one oxygen. As the water approaches freezing temperature, the water molecules continue to crystallize in this tetrahedral arrangement.\nBut water does something unlike most substances. As it nears freezing, instead of continuing to contract, it expands slightly from about 4 degrees to 0 degrees Celsius as the motion of the molecules slows with the cold, and the hydrogen bonds extend the molecules to their fullest distance from each other. It’s like a ring of people holding hands, elbows bent, and then gradually straightening their arms to the fullest extension so that they’re at the greatest distance from each other. When water molecules do this, the hexagonal structure expands into a larger and larger hexagonal structure.\nThe snowflake, with its six sides, is what results from this process: It is a large, gorgeous ice crystal. Ice crystals are like mineral rock crystals. The macroscopic (large) shape you see is dictated by the microscopic, molecular crystalline structure. Ice has a hexagonal crystalline structure, so a snowflake has a hexagonal structure. Sodium chloride, aka table salt, has a cubic molecular structure, so the salt crystals you shake on your food have a cubic shape.\nIt’s interesting that hydrogen bonding causes snowflakes to be six sided (are you listening, Google?), but it carries far greater consequences than beautiful snowflakes. Breaking those hydrogen bonds apart so that water can transform from liquid to gas takes a lot of heat, so the boiling point of water is much higher than it is for other, similar molecules. Based on similar molecules, water’s boiling point should be about -80 degrees Celsius (-176 degrees Fahrenheit) (!) instead of the 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) it really is (1).\nAnd then there’s the fact that ice floats, which means that the solid form of water is less dense than the liquid form. It is highly unusual for the solid form of a substance to be less dense than its liquid. But because those hydrogen bonds force water into a pretty open, hexagonal crystalline structure as the temperature nears 0 degrees Celsius, molecules are not packed as closely together as they are at warmer temperatures.\nThink of those people holding hands, stiff-arming each other as far apart as possible. If they all started slam dancing, their handholds would break, and they could get closer to one another. Water molecules are a bit like that when the temperature goes above 4 degrees Celsius. When ice melts, some of the hydrogen bonds break, and the water molecules can be closer together. The far-apart water molecules in ice form a less-dense substance than the close-together molecules of liquid water, so ice floats in liquid water.\nThis property of water is integral to life on Earth. When a freshwater lake starts to freeze, the ice floats on the top, insulating the water below and preventing it from freezing. The fish, plants, and other life in the lake remain alive beneath the protective and insulating icy layer. If ice sank instead, over periods of deep freeze during its 4.5 billion year existence, this blue planet would have developed an icy, inhospitable core. Instead, the fact that ice floats meant that Earth was a perfect incubator for life in its oceans. All because oxygen is just a little bit grabby with electrons.\n(1) Petrucci, Ralph H.

If one grows snow crystals in air below atmospheric pressure, they have fewer branches. Symmetry of Snowflakes - Wolaver Symmetry of Snowflakes\nSymmetry of Snowflakes\nsurface bump...................dendrite ...........complex snowflake\nOne thing you notice right away about snow crystals is that they form some elaborate and complex shapes -- often displaying lacy, branching structures.  Where does this complexity come from?  After all, snow crystals are nothing more than ice which has condensed from water vapor.  How does the simple act of water vapor freezing into ice produce such intricate designs ?\n   The answers to these questions lie in just how water molecules travel through the air to condense onto a growing snow crystal.   The water molecules have to diffuse through the air to reach the crystal, and this diffusion slows their growth.  The farther water molecules have to diffuse through the air, the longer it takes them to reach the growing crystal.\n   So consider a flat ice surface that is growing in the air.  If a small bump happens to appear on the surface, then the bump sticks out a bit farther than the rest of the crystal.  This means water molecules from afar can reach the bump a bit quicker than they can reach the rest of the crystal, because they don't have to diffuse quite as far.\n   With more water molecules reaching the bump, the bump grows faster.  In a short time, the bump sticks out even farther than it did before, and so it grows even faster.  We call this a branching instability -- small bumps develop into large branches, and bumps on the branches become sidebranches.  Complexity is born.   This instability is a major player in producing the complex shapes of snow crystals.And since the ambient atmospheric conditions are nearly identical across the crystal, all six budding arms grow at roughly the same rate. \n   The temperature seen by the snow crystal is not constant in time, however, since the crystal is being blown about and is thus carried over great distances in a cloud.  But the crystal growth rates depend strongly on temperature.  Thus the six arms of the snow crystals each change their growth with time, reflecting the ever-changing conditions in the cloud.  And because each arm sees the same conditions, each arms grows the same way.\n   When the branching instability applies itself over and over again to a growing snow crystal, the result is called an ice dendrite.   The word dendrite means \"tree-like,\" and stellar dendrite snow crystals are common.  \n   We can change diffusion in the lab and see how dendrites change.  If one grows snow crystals in air below atmospheric pressure, they have fewer branches.   This is because diffusion doesn't limit the growth so much at lower air pressures, so the branching instability is not so strong.  At higher pressures, more branches appear.\n   The growth of snow crystals depends on a balance between faceting and branching.  Faceting tends to make simple flat surfaces, while branching tends to make more complex structures.  The interplay between faceting and branching is a delicate one, depending strongly on things like temperature and humidity.  This means snow crystals can grow in many different ways, resulting in the great diversity we see in snow crystal forms.\n   So that's the story.  The intricate shape of a single arm is determined by the ever-changing conditions experienced by the crystal as it falls.  Because each arm experiences the same conditions, however, the arms tend to look alike.  The end result is a large-scale, complex, six-fold symmetric snow crystal.  And since snow crystals all follow slightly different paths through the clouds, individual crystals all tend to all look different.\n\n"
