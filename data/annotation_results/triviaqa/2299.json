Lesson learned.\n@   mik2713\n:\n(16 January 2017 - 04:20)\nHope all is well in Hingis Land. Congrats to Jonny and the Cubbies.

Nice to hear from you again on here.\nWorth a try, I s'pose\nStarted By Pheasant Plucker , Aug 19 2007 13:33\nPlease log in to reply\n33 replies to this topic\nFirstname:Crystal\nPosted 31 August 2007 - 03:33\nA joke for you: My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. There was only one little thing bothering me. It was her beautiful younger sister.My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, and generally was bra less. One day \"little\" sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations.She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome.She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister.Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word.She said, \"I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.\"I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door. I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!With tears in his eyes, my future father-in-law hugged me and said, we are very happy that you have passed our little test.....we couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.\"And the moral of this story is:Always keep your condoms in your car.\nLMAO JOHN!\nPosted 30 September 2007 - 02:52\nSurely I do, Stephen Hawkings....\nHaha! Brilliant, E, where did you find a pic of Stephen Hawking where he looks so much like the writer Alan Bennett? I'd never noticed the resemblance before.\nI dunno, what are we to do with this type of thing .... you may recall we talked about \"Spot The Star\" or \"Seperated At Birth\" but we never figured out how to make a game of it or how to award points to entries.Keep thinking, inspiration is sure to pay us a visit eventually, hehe.Edit: In case I didn't make that properly clear, what I mean is celebrity lookalikes.Dear oh dear, the way I write, you'd think I was just learning English . (Or indeed, not bothering to learn it at all, hehe)\nEdited by fivesofar, 30 September 2007 - 07:40.\n\"You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom\"\n(Pink Floyd-Shine On You Crazy Diamond)\nThat line always makes me think of Martina at Roland Garros in `99.

A man rode into town on Friday, stayed for three days and three nights and then rode out again on Friday. How could this be?2. Mary's father has four daughters. The first is called Ann, the second is called Anna and the third is called Annie. What is the name of the other daughter? 3. A woman was pushing her car. When she stopped at a hotel, she realised she was bankrupt. Why?4. A man walks into a shop and asks the shopkeeper how much one would cost. The shopkeeper replies \"ï¿½1.20\", so the man asks how much ten would cost. The shopkeeper replies \"ï¿½2.40\". The man then asks for one hundred and thirty and hands ï¿½3.60 to the shopkeeper.

I mean, do you all admit I'm the most intelligent member of Hingisorg and have outsmarted you all, and Martina Hingis should marry me and you lot should send me all your money and bow down and call me \"Emperor John The Great\"?Seems reasonable\n(Guess who's been at the vodka\n)I shall now bestow upon you the answers:3.
