Although Fischer eventually won the tournament and although his lifetime score against Fischer was only +1=1-5,  Mednis, who had been working as a chemical engineer until 1972 when Fischer won the WC title, was able to capitalize on Fischer's fame by publishing his most successful book, \" How to Beat Bobby Fischer .\"  Subsequently, he became a Chess Life contributor and author of 21 more books. In 1980, he earned the title of Grandmaster.\n     . . . and so the obit ends.\n          Dr. Max Pavey\n     Flash back to 1951, January 17 to be exact. 7 year old Bobby Fischer took part in a simul given by Dr. Max Pavey (1949 NY state champion) at the Grand Plaza Library in Brooklyn. Pavey was no slouch. With a rating of 2442 he was the eighth ranked player in the U.S. in 1951 (according to \"Chess Review,\" April 1951).  Fischer, predictably, lost his game, but another participant, Edmar Mednis, a 14 year old emigrant from the Riga, Latvia (from where his family had fled in 1944, finally arriving in the U.S. in 1950), drew his game with Peavy. In the audience was a certain Carmine Nigro who was then secretary (and former president and club champion) of the Brooklyn Chess and Checkers Club.  Nigro invited Bobby to join the Brooklyn Club. Nigro subsequently became Bobby Fischer's first teacher.\n \nWho was this Carmine Nigro?\n     I discovered several distinctive and often conflicting sources (listed below) concerning Carmine Nigro. I was able to cull enough facts to paint a reasonably acceptable picture of the man in my mind.\n     Carmine Nigro was less than and more than one might first assume. The automatic assumption might be that, as Bobby Fischer's first chess instructor that he was a superb player himself .  Undoube\ndly, Nigro was a quite capable player by most standards. His 1951 rating was a bit over 2000 (before all this rating inflation). His son claimed that, \"he could play chess blindfolded, sitting in another room calling out the moves in multiple games and play just as well.\"  Still in the same breath his son said, \"He really had the ability to teach beyond what he was capable of doing, because he could visualize and had such a terrific mind.\"   Fischer himself wrote in the introduction to his 1959 book \"Bobby Fischer's Games of Chess,\"  \"Mr. Nigro was possibly not the best player in the world, but he was a very good teacher.\"\n \n      Standing only 5'3\", Carmine Domenico Nigro, born on January 2, 1910, the middle of 3 brothers, proved beyond any doubt that size truly does not matter.  He dropped out of school and moved away from his impoverished home to make his own way at the age of 14.  For a time he lived with his older brother Sal who had taught him to play the mandolin when he was only 8.  Living with the musically-inclined Sal, Carmine also became quite proficient on the clarinet and saxophone.  He and Sal formed a small and seemingly only marginally successful band. \n     He joined the Brooklyn Chess and Checkers Club in 1938 (at age 28) - not to play chess, but to play bridge.  While there he learned chess from an unspecified chess \"master\" whom he had beaten at bridge.  By now Carmine had a wife, Anne, and was soon drafted into the Army (March, 1941).  Anne sent him a book on endgames, which he devoured, and when he returned home in 1944, he was already a strong amateur.\n     He formed his own 7 piece band, complete with a female vocalist, which he called \"Tommy Little and his Orchestra.\"  This band was quite successful locally but since they now had a child, William, his wife encouraged him to take up a more serious and stable career. Carmine became a stockbroker as well as a band leader and a serious student of chess.\n           * As an aside - I'm not sure how this plays out, but Carmine Nigro is\n             most often referred to (by very reliable sources) as President,\n             Secretary and Club Champion of the Brooklyn Chess and Checkers\n             Club. However, Carmine's son, Bill, mentioned that his father was\n             \"president of the YMCA chess club [in Brooklyn].\"  Fischer, in his chess\n             column in Boy's Life in 1966  wrote, \"One of the biggest thrills of my\n             lifewas when I won first prize at the YMCA children's championship.\n             One critical game, incidentally, was against my teacher's son, Bill Nigro.\n             I was nervous in that game, but the training I got from my early games\n             was important to me and gave me confidence. I still have that medal\n             at home.\"  Another well written source states that, \"Bobby. . .was\n             playing a lot of chess at the Brooklyn Chess Club and Brooklyn YMCA.\" \n             So, whether the Brooklyn Chess and Checker Club and the Brooklyn\n             Central YMCA Chess Club were separate entities, or whether the\n             Brooklyn Chess and Checker Club met at the YMCA or whether Nigro\n             was president of one or both - is all a bit confusing. *\n     In \"Endgame, \"Dr. Frank Brady tells us that Nigro not only instructed Fischer in chess but also taught him a bit of music and trained him to play the accordian. Fischer even gave a few accordian performances at the school assemblies, but eventually felt music was interfering with his chess studies and gave it up.\n    From Frank Brady's \"Profile of a Prodigy\":\n            \"Mrs. Fischer's aim of finding Bobby a chess playmate was realized \n             that very evening. Mr.Carmine Nigro, President of the Brooklyn \n             Chess CLub, was teaching his son Tommy the game and offered to \n             tutor Bobby also.  Tommy was basically uninterested and Nigro, a \n             chess lover all his life, greatly increased his son't allowance on those \n             days that the boy \"agreed\" to take a chess lesson from his father.  \n             Nigro had no such problem with Bobby.   He couldn't wait from \n             week to week to take another lesson from Nigro...\n                  In addition to Tommy Nigro and Boby Fischer, there were a few \n             other children in the same age group, and Nigro mustered them \n             into an unofficial team.  Dr. Harold Sussman, a strong Brooklyn \n             master, was teaching his son Raymond and a number of other \n             children from eight to ten years old, and it was arranged for the \n             two teams to meet, thus occasioning Bobby's first formal competitive\n             chess. The teams played two matches the first ending in a score \n             of 5-3 for Nigro's proteges. Bobby drew one game and won one \n             game against Raymond Sussman.  The score of the second match \n             has been lost and forgotten. . . .\n     For what it's worth, either Brady seemingly confused the name of Carmine's son (which is Bill) with that of the name under which Carmine played music (Tommy Little) or Bill had a nickname that I failed to uncover.  At that time, Carmine was no longer president of the Brooklyn Chess Club according to most sources.\n     Bill Nigro added, \"He [Fischer] spent every weekend at our house for several years. He was an eccentric kid -- he so much loved to win, he would throw the pieces across the room if he lost. I would play a game or two with Fischer, then I was ready to go play outside. He stayed with Dad the whole day.\"\n     At any event, Nigro took on Fischer, as well as other students, and tutored him in chess for 5 years - up until just prior to Bobby winning the U.S. Junior Championship (July 1956).  In 1956 Nigro moved his family to Miami Florida where Carmine took up a new hobby - Golf. Taking up the game with a passion he brought to all his endeavors, Nigro was soon working as a stockbroker by day and giving golf lessons at night at a driving range owned by Sam Snead's brother, Homer.\n     Carmine's wife, Anne, died in 1976. He later married Francis (Angie). Carmine Nigro died on August 16, 2001, leaving behind his wife Angie, his son Bill, Bill's wife Martha, 6 grand-children, 3 great-grandchildren and a lifetime of memories.\n     According to Janet McGregor in \"Man of Many Talents\", \"Even into his 90's, Nigro was still playing chess on a daily basis. After retirement he taught music and chess, 'for the fun of it.' In a 1996 article, titled \"Chairman of the Board,\" in \"The Palm Beach Post, \" Ron Wiggins wrote, \"He is a gentle and patient teacher with an almost Pied Piper appeal to children. But at the chessboard, he is a bloodthirsty warrior. Sit for a few lessons - on life as well as chess - with a master.\"\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\n1960 - 1961 Tal. Mikhail Tal (November ...

He was often called \"Misha\", a diminutive for Mikhail, and \"The magician from Riga\" for his daring combinational style. Both The Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games (Burgess, Nunn & Emms 2004) and Modern Chess Brilliancies (Evans 1970) include more games by Tal than any other player.\nTal was also a highly-regarded chess writer; his professional career was that of a chess journalist. The Mikhail Tal Memorial is held in Moscow each year since 2006 to honour his memory. He holds the records for both the first and second longest unbeaten streaks in competitive chess history. Many authorities consider him to have been the greatest attacking Grandmaster of all time.\nEarly years\nTal was born in Riga, Latvia, into a Jewish family. At the age of eight, Tal learned to play chess while watching his father, a doctor. Shortly thereafter he joined the Riga Palace of Young Pioneers chess club. His play was not exceptional at first but he worked hard to improve. Alexander Koblents began tutoring Tal in 1949, after which Tal's game rapidly improved, and by 1951 he had qualified for the Latvian Championship. In the 1952 Latvian Championship Tal finished ahead of his trainer. Tal won his first Latvian title in 1953, and was awarded the title of Candidate Master. He became a Soviet Master in 1954 by defeating Vladimir Saigin in a qualifying match. That same year he also scored his first win over a Grandmaster when Yuri Averbakh lost on time in a drawn position. Tal graduated in Literature from the University of Riga, writing a thesis on the satirical works of Ilf and Petrov, and taught school in Riga for a time in his early twenties. He was a member of the Daugava Sports Society, and represented Latvia in internal Soviet team competitions.\nSoviet champion\nTal first qualified for the USSR Chess Championship final in 1956, finishing joint fifth, and became the youngest player to win it the following year, at the age of 20. He had not played in enough international tournaments to qualify for the title of Grandmaster, but FIDE decided at its 1957 Congress to waive the normal restrictions and award him the title because of his achievement in winning the Soviet Championship.\nTal made three appearances for the USSR at Student Olympiads, from 1956–1958, winning three team gold medals and three board gold medals. He won nineteen games, drew eight, and lost none, for 85.2 percent.\n1957 Tal - Tolush 1 - 0\nHe retained the Soviet Championship title in 1958 at Riga, and competed in the World Chess Championship for the first time. He won the 1958 Interzonal tournament at Portorož, then helped the Soviet Union win their fourth consecutive Chess Olympiad at Munich.\nWorld champion\nTal won a very strong tournament at Zürich, 1959. Following the Interzonal, the top players carried on to the Candidates' Tournament, Yugoslavia 1959. Tal showed superior form by winning with 20/28 points, ahead of Paul Keres with 18½, followed by Tigran Petrosian, Vasily Smyslov, Bobby Fischer, Svetozar Gligorić, Friðrik Ólafsson, and Pal Benko. Tal's victory was attributed to his dominance over the lower half of the field; whilst scoring only one win and three losses versus Keres, he won all four individual games against Fischer, and took 3½ points out of 4 from each of Gligorić, Olafsson, and Benko.\nFischer - Tal 1959 Candidates Match\nFischer vs Tal (0-1) and Tal vs Benko (1-0) and Olafsson vs Keres (0-1):\nCandidates Tournament 1959\nIn 1960, at the age of 23, Tal thoroughly defeated the relatively staid and strategic Mikhail Botvinnik in a World Championship match, held in Moscow, by 12½–8½ (six wins, two losses, and thirteen draws), making him the youngest-ever world champion (a record later broken by Garry Kasparov, who earned the title at 22).\nTal - Champion Of The World! (russian)\nBotvinnik, who had never faced Tal before the title match began, won the return match against Tal in 1961, also held in Moscow, by 13–8 (ten wins to five, with six draws). In the period between the matches Botvinnik had thoroughly analyzed Tal's style, and turned most of the return match's games into slow wars of maneuver or endgames, rather than the complicated tactical melees which were Tal's happy hunting ground. Tal's chronic kidney problems contributed to his defeat, and his doctors in Riga advised that he should postpone the match for health reasons. Yuri Averbakh claimed that Botvinnik would agree to a postponement only if Tal was certified unfit by Moscow doctors, and that Tal then decided to play. His short reign atop the chess world made him one of the two so-called \"winter kings\" who interrupted Botvinnik's long reign from 1948 to 1963 (the other was Smyslov, world champion 1957–1958).\nHis highest Elo rating was 2705, achieved in 1980. His highest Historical Chessmetrics Rating was 2799, in September 1960. This capped his torrid stretch which had begun in early 1957.\nLater achievements\nSoon after losing the rematch with Botvinnik, Tal won the 1961 Bled  supertournament by one point over Fischer, despite losing their individual game, scoring 14½ from nineteen games (+11 -1 =7) with the world-class players Tigran Petrosian, Keres, Gligorić, Efim Geller, and Miguel Najdorf among the other participants.\nTal played in a total of six Candidates' Tournaments and match cycles, though he never again earned the right to play for the world title. In 1962 at Curaçao, he had serious health problems, having undergone a major operation shortly before the tournament, and had to withdraw three-quarters of the way through, scoring just seven points (+3 -10 =8) from 21 games. He tied for first place at the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal to advance to matches. Then in 1965, he lost the final match against Boris Spassky, after defeating Lajos Portisch and Bent Larsen in matches. Exempt from the 1967 Interzonal, he lost a 1968 semi-final match against Viktor Korchnoi, after defeating Gligoric.\nPoor health caused a slump in his play from late 1968 to late 1969, but he recovered his form after having a kidney removed. He won the 1979 Riga Interzonal with an undefeated score of 14/17, but the next year lost a quarter-final match to Lev Polugaevsky, one of the players to hold a positive score against him. He also played in the 1985 Montpellier Candidates' Tournament, a round-robin of 16 qualifiers, finishing in a tie for fourth and fifth places, and narrowly missing further advancement after drawing a playoff match with Jan Timman, who held the tiebreak advantage from the tournament proper.\nFrom July 1972 to April 1973, Tal played a record 86 consecutive games without a loss (47 wins and 39 draws). Between October 23, 1973 and October 16, 1974, he played 95 consecutive games without a loss (46 wins and 49 draws), shattering his previous record. These are the two longest unbeaten streaks in modern chess history.\nA measure of Tal's strength also in his later years is given by his score against Anatoly Karpov, who was some 15 years younger, in tournament games: one loss (at Bugojno, 1980) and nineteen draws out of 20 games they played.\nOne of Tal's greatest achievements during his later career was an equal first place with Karpov (whom he seconded in a number of tournaments and world championships) in the 1979 Montreal \"Tournament of Stars\", with an unbeaten score of (+6 =12), the only undefeated player in the field, which also included Spassky, Portisch, Vlastimil Hort, Robert Hübner, Ljubomir Ljubojevic, Lubomir Kavalek, Timman and Larsen.\n1979 Montreal: Spassky - Tal 0 - 1\nTal played in 21 Soviet Championships, winning it a record six times (1957, 1958, 1967, 1972, 1974, 1978), a number only equalled by Botvinnik. He was also a five-time winner of the International Chess Tournament in Tallinn, Estonia, with victories in 1971, 1973, 1977, 1981, and 1983.\nTal also had successes in blitz chess; in 1970, he took second place to Fischer, who scored 19/22, in a blitz tournament at Herceg Novi, Yugoslavia, ahead of Korchnoi, Petrosian and Smyslov. In 1988, aged 51, he won the second official World Blitz Championship (the first was won by Kasparov the previous year in Brussels) at Saint John, ahead of such players as Kasparov, the reigning world champion, and ex-champion Anatoly Karpov. In the final, he defeated Rafael Vaganian by 3½-½.\nTeam competitions\nIn Olympiad play, Mikhail Tal was a member of eight Soviet teams, each of which won team gold medals (1958, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1972, 1974, 1980, and 1982), won sixty-five games, drew thirty-four, and lost only two games (81.2 percent). This percentage makes him the player with the best score among those participating in at least four Olympiads. Individually, Tal won seven Olympiad board medals, including five gold (1958, 1962, 1966, 1972, 1974), and two silver (1960, 1982).\nTal also represented the Soviet Union at six European Team Championships (1957, 1961, 1970, 1973, 1977, 1980), winning team gold medals each time, and three board gold medals (1957, 1970, and 1977). He scored 14 wins, 20 draws, and three losses, for 64.9 percent. Tal played board nine for the USSR in the first match against the Rest of the World team at Belgrade 1970, scoring 2 out of 4. He was on board seven for the USSR in the second match against the Rest of the World team at London 1984, scoring 2 out of 3. The USSR won both team matches. He was an Honoured Master of Sport.\nFrom 1950 (when he won the Latvian junior championship) to 1991, Tal won or tied for first in 68 tournaments (see table below). During his 41-year career he played about 2,700 tournament or match games, scoring over 65 percent.\nHealth problems\nTal suffered from bad health, and had to be hospitalized frequently throughout his career, mainly for kidney problems. Eventually one of his diseased kidneys was removed. Tal was a chain smoker and a heavy drinker. He was also briefly addicted to morphine. On June 28, 1992, Tal died in a Moscow hospital, officially of kidney failure. But his friend and fellow Soviet grandmaster Genna Sosonko reported that \"in reality, all his organs had stopped functioning. Tal had the congenital deformity of ectrodactyly in his right hand (visible in some photographs).\nThe Last Chess Game of Mikhail Tal\nThe Last Game Tal - Kasparow 1-0 video\nPlaying style\nTal loved the game in itself and considered that \"Chess, first of all, is Art.\" He was known to play numerous blitz games against unknown or relatively weak players purely for the joy of playing.\nKnown as \"The Magician from Riga\", Tal was the archetype of the attacking player, developing an extremely powerful and imaginative style of play. His approach over the board was very pragmatic – in that respect, he is one of the heirs of ex-World Champion Emanuel Lasker. He often sacrificed material in search of the initiative, which is defined by the ability to make threats to which the opponent must respond. With such intuitive sacrifices, he created vast complications, and many masters found it impossible to solve all the problems he created over the board, though deeper post-game analysis found flaws in some of his conceptions. The famous sixth game of his first world championship match with Botvinnik is typical in that regard: Tal sacrificed a knight with little compensation but prevailed when the unsettled Botvinnik failed to find the correct response.\nAlthough his playing style was scorned by ex-World Champion Vasily Smyslov as nothing more than \"tricks\", Tal convincingly beat virtually every notable grandmaster with his trademark aggression. Viktor Korchnoi and Paul Keres are two of the very few with a significant plus record against him. It is also notable that he adopted a more sedate and positional style in his later years; for many chess lovers, the apex of Tal's style corresponds with the period (approximately from 1971 to 1979) when he was able to integrate the solidity of classical chess with the imagination of his youth.\nOf the current top-level players, the Latvian-born Spaniard Alexei Shirov has probably been most influenced or inspired by Tal's sacrificial style. In fact, he studied with Tal as a youth. Many other Latvian grandmasters and masters, for instance Alexander Shabalov and Alvis Vitolins, have played in a similar vein, causing some to speak of a \"Latvian School of Chess.\" Tal contributed little to opening theory, despite a deep knowledge of most systems, the Sicilian and the Ruy Lopez in particular. But his aggressive use of the Modern Benoni Defense, particularly in his early years, led to a complete re-evaluation of this variation at the time, though it is seldom seen in top-class tournament play in the 21st century.\nWritings\nTal was a prolific and highly respected chess writer, serving as editor of the Latvian chess magazine Šahs (\"Chess\") from 1960 to 1970. He also wrote four books: one on his 1960 World Championship with Botvinnik, his autobiography The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal, Attack with Mikhail Tal coauthored by Iakov Damsky, and Tal's Winning Chess Combinations  coauthored by Viktor Khenkin. His books are renowned for the detailed narrative of his thinking during the games. American Grandmaster Andrew Soltis  reviewed his book on the world championship match as \"simply the best book written about a world championship match by a contestant. That shouldn't be a surprise because Tal was the finest writer to become world champion\". New Zealand Grandmaster Murray Chandler wrote in the introduction to the 1997 reissued algebraic edition of The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal that the book was possibly the best chess book ever written.\nTal, Mikhail (1997).

ISBN 1-85744-043-9.\nShort Tal interview in Russian\nShort Movie: The French Defense\nIt's  Moscow, 1960.  For a whole year the world has been waiting to see what  happens when Tal and Botvinnik meet for the World Chess Crown.  And now,  the wait is over.  The time is now.\nThe French Defense by  Dimitri Raitzin is an award-winning play about this struggle of  generations.  The protagonists are the new and the old, pure talent and a  lifetime of experience, two different styles and two different outlooks  on life.\nIt is a play about a collision between the two best  chess players in the world: the Champion - a survivor of the Stalin era  who has held the World Title for 12 years, and the Challenger - a bright  new phenom who has only one thing on his mind: victory.\nThe French Defense 1\n\n"
