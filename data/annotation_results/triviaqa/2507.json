Traditionally, the same distinction has been maintained in English, so that graffiti, being plural, would require a plural verb: the graffiti were all over the wall. By the same token, the singular would require a singular verb: there was a graffito on the wall. Today, these distinctions survive in some specialist fields such as archaeology but sound odd to most native speakers. The most common modern use is to treat graffiti as if it were a mass noun, similar to a word like writing, and not to use graffito at all. In this case, graffiti takes a singular verb, as in the graffiti was all over the wall. Such uses are now widely accepted as standard. A similar process is going on with other words such as agenda, data, and media\nOrigin\nMid 19th century: from Italian (plural), from graffio a scratch.\nPronunciation\nWhich of the following is correct?\nFailures are all too common\nFailures are all to common\nWhich of the following is correct?\nDon't worry too much\nWhich of the following is correct?\nThe show went from good too bad\nThe show went from good to bad\nWhich of the following is correct?\nHer sight's none too good\nHer sight's none to good\nWhich of the following is correct?\nIs Jenny going too?\nWhich of the following is correct?\nHe was driving far too fast\nHe was driving far to fast\nWhich of the following is correct?\nI've been married to Jack for 4 years\nI've been married too Jack for 4 years\nWhich of the following is correct?\nWe're going too Paris in May\nWe're going to Paris in May\nWhich of the following is correct?\nThis, too, is a film about love\nThis, to, is a film about love\nWhich of the following is correct?\nTo few people think globally\nToo few people think globally\nYou scored /10 practise again?\nRetry\nMost popular in the world\nAustralia\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nGraffiti is writing or drawings that have been scribbled, scratched, ... are from the Italian word graffiato (\"scratched ... the most commonly used ...
