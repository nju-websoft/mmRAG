All days of the week in French end in \"-di\" with the exception of Sunday. And you will find it easy to remember their gender because they are all masculine. Unlike in English, French days of the week are not capitalized unless they are placed in the beginning of a sentence. It's also worthwhile to mention that French calendars normally start on Monday rather than Sunday.\nAudio\nSunday\ndee-mah(n)sh\n*French pronunciation of days of the week by Labé. French standard accent, west of France. Audio recording distributed under CC-SA-3.0 If you want to know what day is today, the following phrase will be helpful: Quel jour est-ce aujourd'hui? What day is it today? [kehl zhoor ehs oh-zhoor-dwee]  In order to say that something happened \"on\" a certain day in French, you need to use the indefinite article \"le\" (masculine) in front of the day of the week. For example: Le vendredi, je m'amuse. On Fridays, I have fun. Le mercredi je cuisine. On Wednesday, I cook.\nMore French Words for Scheduling and Planning\nBelow you will find several more French words and phrases that will help you to talk about schedules and calendar events in French.\nFrench word\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nFrench Days of the Week.

The party / It is on Saturday.\n   Quand est le repas ? Le repas / Il est lundi.\n   When is the meal? The meal / It is on Monday.\nWhen asking which day an annual event will fall on, say Quel jour / Quand tombe ... cette année ? (Note that this question is for when you know the date of the event. To ask about an actual date rather than just the day of the week, see page 1 .)\n   Quel jour tombe ton anniversaire (cette année) ? C'est dimanche.\n   What day is your birthday (this year)? It's (on) Sunday.\n   Quand tombe Halloween (cette année) ? C'est mercredi.\n   When (What day) is Halloween this year?         It's (on) Wednesday.\n \nDefinite articles\nWhen talking about the day of the week something happened or will happen, you may or may not need a definite article , depending on how far the event is in the past or future and whether it is a one-time event.\n1) For an event that occurred last week or will occur next week, you do not need an article.\nGenerally speaking, this is equivalent to using the word \"this\" in English:\n   Il est arrivé samedi.\n   He arrived on Saturday, He arrived this Saturday.\n   Nous allons faire des achats mercredi.\n   We're going to go shopping on Wednesday, this Wednesday.\n2) If it occurs further in the past or future, you do need an article. In the English translation, you're likely to need the word \"that\":\n   Il est arrivé le samedi (de cette semaine-là).\n   He arrived that Saturday, He arrived that week on Saturday.\n   Nous allons faire des achats le mercredi (avant la fête).\n   We're going to go shopping that Wednesday (before the party).\n3) You also need the definite article when talking about something that occurred, occurs, or will occur on that same day more than once:\n   Il arrivait le samedi.\n   He used to arrive on Saturdays, every Saturday.\n   Nous faisons des achats le mercredi.\n   We go shopping on Wednesdays.\n   Je ne vais plus travailler le vendredi.\n   I'm not going to work on Fridays any more.\n \nDay of the week + date\nWhen including the day of the week in answer to the question \"what's the date?\" , there's one slightly tricky aspect to be aware of in French: the day of the week should be placed between the definite article and the numeric date.\n   C'est\n   On est              + le + day + date + month (+ year)\n   Nous sommes\n   C'est le samedi 8 avril.\n   It's Saturday, 8 April / the 8th of April / April 8th.\n   Nous sommes le lundi premier octobre 2012.\n   It's Monday, October 1st, 2012.\nOr if you really want to say the day of the week first, just be sure to pause before following with the date.\n   On est mardi... le 16 juillet.\n   It's Tuesday... July 16th.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nFrench Days of the Week Song. ... Lundi, Mardi, Mercredi, Jeudi, Vendredi, Samedi, Dimanche ... The days of the week are very disciplined.
