(Theme From Mahogany)”\n(Unreviewed)\n“Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You’re Going To?)” is a song written by Michael Masser and Gerald Goffin, and recorded first by American singer Thelma Houston in 1973, and most notably by Diana Ross as the theme to the 1975 Motown/Paramount film Mahogany.\nMariah Carey covered the song in 1998 and intended to release it as the fourth single from the #1’s album but it was not included on the american version due to Jennifer Lopez covering it on her debut album On the 6 and intending to release it as a single as well.\nSony felt it that it wasn’t right to have two artists covering and releasing the same song as a single at the same time. Both of them ended up not releasing the song after all.\nIt was later included on international pressings of M’s #1’s album and issued as a promotional single in Brazil and some parts of Europe during June.\nHidden\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\nGet this from a library!

Do You Know Where You're Going To? by Diana Ross Do You Know Where You're Going To? by Diana Ross Songfacts\nThis song was the theme song of the 1976 movie Mahogany, where Ross acted as the title character and as Tracy Chambers. The movie was directed by Berry Gordy Jr., who worked with Ross as head of Motown Records. >>\nSuggestion credit:\nAlong with Elgar's \"Pomp and Circumstance,\" this was one of the most requested graduation songs. >>\nSuggestion credit:\nTiffany - Dover, FL, for above 2\nGerry Goffin and Michael Masser wrote this. Goffin was married to Carole King, and wrote many famous songs with her, including \"The Locomotion\" and \"You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman.\" Masser wrote \"Touch Me In The Morning\" for Ross in 1973, and wrote several hits for Whitney Houston.\nDiana Ross was the first singer to perform at the Oscar ceremony live via telecast; she was in Holland and sang this while walking the streets of Amsterdam. >>\nSuggestion credit:\nAndy - Glasgow, Scotland\nThis song makes the bad grammar category because it ends a statement in a preposition. Proper grammar would be \"Do you know where you're going?,\" but that wouldn't scan very well.\n\n"
