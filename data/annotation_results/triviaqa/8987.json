Marriage and Weddings in the UK - British Culture ... Marriage and Weddings in the UK - British Culture - British Customs and Traditions in May\nRingbearer - an attendant, often a young boy, who carries the wedding rings.\nUshers - helpers, usually men, who assist with the organization.\nFor the groom:-\nBest man - a close male friend or relative of the groom, given a place of honour.\nGroomsmen - one or more male attendants who support the groom.\nFor the bride:-\nMaid of honour - a close female friend or relative of the bride, given a place of honour. If she is married, she is called the \"matron of honour\" instead.\nBridesmaids - one or more female attendants who support the bride.\nFather of the Bride - One who symbolically \"gives away\" the bride. If her father is deceased or otherwise unavailable, another male relative, often an uncle or brother, will give the bride away.\nFlower girl - a young girl who scatters flowers in front of the bridal party.\nJunior Bridesmaids - young girl typically between the ages of 8 and 16 who is too old to be a flowergirl, but the bride wants to be a part of the wedding.\nWedding guests are generally sent invitations to which they are expected to reply (rsvp). The guests are generally invited to both the wedding and the wedding reception afterwards, although sometimes reception places are limited. Often certain people are invited due to perceived family obligations, as to not receive an invitation can be considered an insult.\nThe Wedding Ceremony\nA bride's wedding day is often touted as \"the happiest day of her life\", but in all honesty it's often a very stressful experience as there are lots of conventions surrounding the whole thing and you can get caught up in family rows, and trying to please everyone. Still it's a good test of a couple's fortitude.\nWhen the guests arrive for a wedding the ushers' duty is to hand out the correct  books, flowers and the order of service, they also ensure the guests are seated in the correct places. Traditionally, the side on which people sit depends on whether they are friends or family of the bride or of the groom. The front rows are generally reserved for close family or friends, with the very first seats reserved for the bridal party. However, in many ceremonies the bridal party will remain standing at the altar during the ceremony along with the bride and groom.\nThe groom and his best man wait inside the church for the arrival of the bride and her \"entourage\".\nThis entourage generally arrives in elegant cars or in horse-drawn coaches, specially hired for the occasion. The bride's entourage normally consists of the bride, the bride's father and all the various bridesmaids, maids of honour, sometimes flower girls and page boys attend her. The page boy's task is often to carry the wedding rings on a cushion.\nThe ushers and/or groomsmen escort the grandparents of the bride and groom to their seats.\nThe ushers and/or groomsmen escort the mother of the groom and mother of the bride to their seats.\nThe bridesmaids enter, escorted by the groomsmen.\nThe maid or matron of honour enters, either by herself or escorted by the best man.\nThe ringbearer or page boy enters.\nThe flower girl enters. (In some ceremonies, the ringbearer will accompany the flower girl.)\nThe bride then proceeds down the aisle, escorted by her father, to the accompaniment of music (usually the wedding march, often called \"Here comes the bride\"), and the ceremony starts.\nDuring the ceremony the bride and groom make their marriage vows. Marriage vows are promises a couple makes to each other during a wedding ceremony. In Western culture, these promises have traditionally included the notions of affection (\"love, comfort, keep\"), faithfulness (\"forsaking all others\"), unconditionality (\"for richer or for poorer\", \"in sickness and in health\"), and permanence (\"as long as we both shall live\", \"until death do us part\").\nMost wedding vows are taken from traditional religious ceremonies, but nowadays in the UK many couples choose touching love poems or lyrics from a love song  revised as wedding vows and some couples even choose to write their own vows, rather than relying on standard ones spoken by the celebrant (registrar, priest or vicar).\nAfter the vows have been spoken the couple exchange rings. The wedding ring is placed on the third finger of the left hand, also called the \"ring\" finger.  The wedding ring is usually a plain gold ring.  I was once told that the third finger was chosen because in the past people believed a vein ran from that finger, straight to the heart - modern anatomy books havel put paid to that theory though.\nAfter the wedding ceremony, the bride, groom, officiant, and two witnesses generally go off to a side room to sign the wedding register. Without this the marriage is not legal and a wedding certificate cannot be issued.\nAfterward, guests file out to throw flower petals, confetti, birdseed, or rice (uncooked for obvious reasons) over the newly-married couple for good luck.\nThe bride stands with her back to all the guests and throws her bouquet over her head to them. Whoever catches the bouquet is the next person to get married. I don't know if this has ever been scientifically tested, but it can result in a very unseemly scramble, reminiscent of rugby scrums.\nFinally, a photo session ensues of the couple leaving the church, and everyone has to stand around to form formal groups for the photo album. A lot of people video the whole thing, which can be good for a laugh on YouTube.\nNice Day for a White Wedding\nIn the past Wednesday was considered the most auspicious day to get married, as shown in this old rhyme, which seems to favour the first half of the week.\nMonday for wealth,\nFriday for crosses,\nSaturday for no luck at all.\nNowadays,  most weddings  take place on a Saturday, which might account for the rise in divorce rates.\nThe Clothing\nThe Western custom of a bride wearing a white wedding dress, came to symbolize purity in the Victorian era (despite popular misconception and the hackneyed jokes of situation comedies, the white dress did not  indicate virginity, this was  symbolized by a face veil). In the past the veil was worn to confuse any evil spirits.\nThere's another rhyme that affects what the bride wears:-\n\"Something old,\nSomething borrowed,\nSomething blue.\"\nOften the bride will wear an heirloom, or maybe carry a family bible or prayer book, the dress of course is usually the something new, and they will borrow something from someone to wear. The something blue can be difficult, but a lot of brides get round this by wearing a blue garter under their dress.\nWithin the \"white wedding\" tradition, a white dress and veil would not have been considered appropriate in the second or third wedding of a widow or divorcee. Nowadays it really isn't an issue.\nBefore the white wedding dress became \"traditional\" an old poem (which seems   to favour blue) sang the praises or woes of various colour choices.\n“Married in white, you will have chosen all right.\nMarried in grey, you will go far away.\nMarried in black, you will wish yourself back.\nMarried in red, you’ll wish yourself dead.\nMarried in blue, you will always be true.\nMarried in pearl, you’ll live in a whirl.\nMarried in green, ashamed to be seen,\nMarried in yellow, ashamed of the fellow.\nMarried in brown, you’ll live out of town.\nMarried in pink, your spirits will sink.\"\nThe average price of a traditional white wedding dress is around £826.\nIn the Middle Ages, bridesmaids used to wear the same outift as the bride. This was to confuse any evil spirits who wished the bride harm. Nowadays they are more likely to be dressed in such a way as to scare any evil spirits away, after all no bride wants to be outshone on the big day.\nThe reception\nAfter the ceremony there is usally a reception at which the married couple, the couple's parents, the best man and the wedding entourage greet each of the guests. At such events it is traditional to eat and drink - a lot.\nDuring the reception a number of speeches and/or toasts are given in honour of the couple.\nAny dancing is commonly started by the bride and groom, usually termed the \"Bridal Waltz\", but dancing an actual waltz is comparatively rare - often the couple chooses their favourite piece of music or a song.\nAn arranged dance between the bride and her father is also traditional. Sometimes the groom will cut in halfway through the dance, symbolizing the bride leaving her father and joining her new husband.\nAt some point the married couple may become the object of a charivari, a good-natured hazing of the newly-married couple. While this is most familiar in the form of tying tin cans to the bumper of the couple's car, or spraying shaving cream on the windows, some of the pranks can be far more malicious. The worst one I've ever heard of is when the bride and groom returned from honeymoon to find their front door had been bricked over.\nThe final tradition is the newly married couple to set off for their honeymoon.\nHave your cake and eat it\nAt the wedding reception an elaborate, tiered, wedding cake is often served. Traditionally this is a fruit cake. Often there are a couple of little figures on  top of the cake, normally they are a representation of the bride and groom in formal wedding attire.\nIt is considered lucky for the couple to cut the cake together. It symbolises them working together during their marriage. A tier is usually stored, and eaten by the couple at their first wedding anniversary, or at the christening of their first child. The cake can be frozen and if the top tier of the cake is fruitcake, it can  be stored for a long  time, because it's so full of sugar (and often alcohol) that it's very well preserved.\nPeople who were invited to the wedding, but were unable to attend are often sent a piece of cake in a small box, as a memento.\nOne superstition is that unmarried guests should place a piece of wedding cake under their pillow, as it will increase their prospects of finding a partner. Bridesmaids who do so will supposedly dream of their future husbands, which must make Johnny Depp a potential bigamist.\nBritish Wedding Traditions\nThe happy couple toast each other. (This has nothing to do with sliced bread.)\nThe newlyweds have the fiirst dance.\nThe couple              cut the cake together, this symbolizes their first meal as husband and wife ( see above ).\nThe bride may throw her bouquet to the assembled group of all unmarried women in attendance, with folklore suggesting the person who catches it will be the next to wed.\n(A fairly recent equivalent has the groom throwing the bride's garter to the assembled unmarried men; the man who catches it is supposedly the next to wed.)\nIt is usual for the couple to go away on holiday together. This is called the honeymoon.\nOn arriving back home it is traditional for the husband to carry his wife into their new home. This is called carrying the bride over the threshold.\nThe Cost of Getting Married in the UK\nIn 2004 the average wedding in the UK cost £16,000, and prices have risen since then, by 2012 it stood at £18,500, and according to Brides Magazine in 2015, it is a whopping £24,716!  Of course there is no need to get caught up in Competitive Wedding Syndrome, none of it is actually necessary. You can simply get married and live happily ever after.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nThe History of Wedding ... Jesus turning the water into Wine as his first miracle at the Wedding of Cana in ...

Brides, check back, new vendors added daily!\nThe History of Wedding Traditions\nVirtually every part of a wedding, from the engagement to the   honeymoon, has rich history. Cultural roots, ancestry, and religious beliefs   have shaped marriages for thousands of years. The following descriptions will   provide you with a brief history of various wedding elements.\nThe First Marriage Rites\nFrom the time of Adam   and Eve, the relationship between a man and a woman has been unique and ordained   by God. Eve was created for Adam and to complete his need for companionship. Our   earliest records of history depict unification between a man and a woman and   their respect for a higher being. It wasn't until Abraham disobeyed God that   other women came into the picture and left generations of unrest for those who   chose to take more than one wife.\nThe Bachelor Dinner\nMore commonly known today   as the bachelor party, this celebration in the groom's honor was originally   called the bachelor dinner, or stag party. Like many other wedding traditions,   the custom has stood the test of time. It first came about in the fifth century,   in Sparta, where military comrades would feast and toast one another on the eve   of a friend's wedding. Even today, a bachelor party customarily takes place   quite close to the actual wedding date, as it has become known as the groom's   last taste of freedom. Despite the risqué entertainment that is associated with   stag parties today, bachelor parties have not always entailed this controversial   element. Although rowdy and boisterous, bachelor parties are traditionally   organized to allow the jittery groom and his wedding attendants to release some   anxieties before the big day.\nThe Wedding Party\nDuring the \"marriage by   capture\" era, close friends of the groom-to-be assisted him when he kidnapped   the bride from her family. The first ushers and best men were more like a small   army, fighting off the brides angry relatives as the groom rode away with   her.\nBridesmaids and maids of honor became more common when weddings   were planned. For several days before the marriage, a senior maid attended to   the bride-to-be. This maid or matron of honor, as we know her today, ensured   that the bridal wreath was made and helped the bride get dressed. All   bridesmaids helped the bride decorate for the wedding feast.\nFor a long time, bridesmaids wore dresses much like the bride's   gown, while ushers dressed in clothing that was similar to the groom's attire.   This tradition began for protection against evil rather than for uniformity; if   evil spirits or jealous suitors attempted to harm the newlyweds, they would be   confused as to which two people were the bride and groom.\nWedding Flowers\nBefore the use of flowers in   the bridal bouquet, women carried aromatic bunches of garlic, herbs, and grains   to drive evil spirits away as they walked down the aisle. Over time, these were   replaced with flowers, symbolizing fertility and everlasting love. Specific   flowers have special meanings in many cultures. In Hawaii, the bride and groom   wear leis; newlyweds in India don floral headdresses.\nThe Wedding\nThe wedding is one of life's   primeval and surprisingly unchanged rites of passage. Nearly all of the customs   we observe today are merely echoes of the past. Everything from the veil, rice,   flowers, and old shoes, to the bridesmaids and processionals, at one time, bore   a very specific and vitally significant meaning. Today, although the original   substance is often lost, we incorporate old world customs into our weddings   because they are traditional and ritualistic.\nOld world marriage customs continue to thrive today, in diluted,   disguised and often upgraded forms. Customs we memorialize today were once \"brand new\" ideas. Although historical accuracy is hard to achieve, the   historical weight attached to old world wedding customs and traditions is   immense. While reading through these pages, feel free to use, reinterpret, or   omit them in your own wedding.\nRemember, as you plan for your wedding, to create new family   traditions and customs to be handed down to your children and their children.   Just think, maybe someday, your \"new custom\" will be as unique and exciting as   these presented here.\nWedding History\nUp to and during the Middle   Ages, weddings were considered family/community affairs. The only thing needed   to create a marriage was for both partners to state their consent to take one   another as spouses. Witnesses were not always necessary, nor were the presence   of the clergy. In Italy, for example, the marriage was divided into three parts.   The first portion consisted of the families of the groom and bride drawing up   the papers. The bride didn't even have to be there for that. The second, the   betrothal, was legally binding and may or may not have involved consummation. At   this celebration, the couple exchanged gifts (a ring, a piece of fruit, etc.),   clasped hands and exchanged a kiss. The \"vows\" could be a simple as, \"Will you   marry me?\" \"I will.\" The third part of the wedding, which could occur several   years after the betrothal, was the removal of the bride to the groom's home. The   role of the clergy at a medieval wedding was simply to bless the couple. It   wasn't official church policy until the council of Trent in the 15th century   that a third party (i.e., a priest), as opposed to the couple themselves, was   responsible for performing the wedding. In the later medieval period, the   wedding ceremony moved from the house of the bride to the church. It began with   a procession to the church from the bride's house. Vows were exchanged outside   the church (by the way, the priest gave the bride to the groom...I don't think   she was presented by her father) and then everyone moved inside for Mass. After   Mass, the procession went back to the bride's house for a feast. Musicians   accompanied the procession.\n\"Let's Tie the Knot\" or 'Let's Get   Hitched\"\nTying the Knot, an old term for a ritual now being renewed   in our weddings today. Not new-age or western-slang about 'hitchin' up yer gal   like a horse'. Although the term hitching was a rope making process used for   tying up horses with ancient old world roots, it is undoubtedly associated with   'tying the knot'. These terms are analogous with a proposal of wedlock. The term   Tie the Knot came from the Renaissance Ceremony called \"Handfasting\". 'Handfast'   and its variations are defined in the Oxford English dictionary as \"to make a   contract of marriage between (parties) by joining of hands.\" This could also be   interpreted today as a proposal of marriage for a specific period of time,   traditionally a year and a day. A Hand Fasting ceremony is incorporated into   formal wedding ceremonies and sometimes done at or as an Engagement Party.\nHandfasting\nThe old way in Great Britain for   couples to pledge their betrothal was for them to join hands, his right to her   right, his left to her left, so from above they looked like an infinity symbol.   Done in front of witnesses, this made them officially \"married\" for a year and a   day, following which they could renew permanently or for another year and a day.   This was called \"handfasting\" and was used extensively in the rural areas where   priests and ministers didn't go all that often. Sharing a cup and pledging their   betrothal in front of witnesses used to accomplish the same thing (usually done   in taverns) but was eventually outlawed in most of Europe. In fact, the   reference I got that from mentioned only Switzerland because that country was   one of the last to stop recognizing it as a legal marriage. Handfastings   (ancient word for weddings) were traditional before weddings became a legal   function of the government or a papal responsibility taken over by the formal   religions in the early 1500's. The very word Handfasting derived its origin from   the wedding custom of tying (or hitching; see section below) the bride and   groom's hands (actually their wrists, not hands) together, as a symbol to their   clan, tribe or village of their decision to be bound together in family living.   The traditional length of time was a year and a day, or 13 moon cycles. If the   marriage proved to last over this period of time, then the vows would be renewed   for a lifetime or they renewed them for \"as long as love shall last\". Often   during this (trial) period of time the bride would be referred to as a Virgin,   or 'a woman not owned by a man'. The wedding would be best arranged during the   time of the new moon, for the new moon symbolizes new beginnings, the beginning   of a new cycle and also looks like the Moon Goddess smiling down on them in the   night sky.\nVow Renewal\nThe Handfasting Renewal was the   original Vow Renewal Ceremony. Hand-fasting is the old Celtic tradition of   binding two people in love together (like matrimony). It was traditionally   performed on May 1st (although any day that the couple wishes is fine too), and   those who were handfasted renewed their vows if they chose to stay together and   were accepted into their community as a new family, which is what our culture   does upon the initial Wedding Ceremony.\nWhy are more people renewing their wedding   vows?\nAfter the birth of a child or recovery of traumatic event or illness;\nBecause of a pending separation by distance or call of duty;\nBecause of tender wishes to revisit their commitment to each other;\nBecause of a \"quickie\" marriage that didn't hold much meaning;\nBecause of separation or problems and desiring to reconcile with ceremony;\nBecause it is a fun way to celebrate your anniversary, regardless of the   number of years.\nIf you choose to send out invitations, \"Bride's All New Book of Etiquette,\" recommends the following wording: \"The honor of your presence is requested at   the reaffirmation of the wedding vows of Mr. and Mrs. John Smith\" etc. (the same   as a wedding). Handwritten notes could be written for a less formal event.   Wilderness Weddings also issues a Special Renewal Certificate at the end of the   ceremony.\nHave you thought of bridesmaids? If you decide on bridesmaids, choose dresses   that could be reused. What is the ceremony like? The same as a wedding with the   same or new vows, an outdoor wedding or indoor, quiet, traditional or wild and   crazy! You can still wear your first dress or your mom's dress or a whole new   look with any color you wish! What about the ring part? You can use your first   rings or have new ones for the special occasion. Your kids can be a part of it,   as ring bearer and flower girl, maid of honor, best man, etc. Your budget and   formality will dictate selection of a disc jockey or band. Don't forget the   photographer, flowers, and favors. Consider having a table set up at the   reception with family photos, and mementos of your marriage.\nThe Bouquet\nThe earth laughs in flowers;\nA flower is   love looking for a word.\nAt its inception, the bouquet formed part of the wreaths and garlands worn by   both the bride and groom. It was considered a symbol of happiness. Originally   bridal wreaths and bouquets were made of herbs, which had magical and meaningful   definitions for the couple's future life. Traditional Celtic bouquets included   ivy, thistle and heather. Ancient uses included herbs, not flowers, in bouquets   because they felt herbs -- especially garlic -- had the power to cast off evil   spirits (can you imagine walking up the aisle holding a clump of garlic!?). If a   bride carried sage (the herb of wisdom) she became wise; if she carried dill   (the herb of lust) she became lusty. Flower girls carried sheaves of wheat, a   symbol of growth, fertility, and renewal. Later, flowers replaced herbs and took   on meanings all their own. Orange blossoms, for example, mean happiness and   fertility. Ivy means fidelity; lilies mean purity.\nThe Best Man\nMany centuries ago, before the women's   rights movement, men who had decided upon a wife often had to forcefully take   her with him (or kidnap her) if her family did not approve of him. The tradition   of a \"best man\" probably has its origin with the Germanic Goths, when it was   customary and preferable for a man to marry a woman from within his own   community. When women came into short supply \"locally,\" eligible bachelors would   have to seek out and capture a bride from a neighboring community. As you might   guess this was not a one-person operation, and so the future bridegroom would be   accompanied by a male companion who would help. Our custom of the best man is a   throwback to that two-man, strong-armed tactic, for, of course the future groom   would select only the best man he knew to come long for such an important   task.\nThe role of the best man evolved. By 200 AD his task was still more than just   safeguarding the ring. There remained a real threat that the bride's family   would attempt to obtain her return forcibly, so the best man remained at the   groom's side throughout the marriage ceremony, alert and well-armed. He   continued his duties after the ceremony by standing guard as sentry outside the   newlywed's home. Much of this is German folklore, but is not without written   documentation and physical artifacts. We have records that indicate that beneath   the altars of many churches of early peoples (the Huns, Goths, Visigoths, and   Vandals) there lay an arsenal of clubs, knives, and spears. The indication is   that these were there to protect the groom from possible attack by the bride's   family in an attempt to recapture her.\nTraditionally, the bride stands to the left side of the groom. This was much   more than meaningless etiquette. Among the Northern European barbarians (a name   given to them by the Romans), a groom placed his captured bride to his left to   protect her, as he kept his right hand free to use for defense. Also originating   from this practice of abduction, which literally swept a bride off her feet,   sprang the later symbolic act of carrying the bride across the threshold of her   new home. It may well be that even the honeymoon had its origin with this   capture scenario. It may well have served as a cooling-off period for the   bride's family. It was the groom's hope that when the newlyweds returned from   their honeymoon that all would be forgiven.\nSomething old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, and   a silver sixpence in her shoe.\nThis good luck saying dates back to   Victorian times and many brides try to arrange their wedding attire accordingly.   Something old represents the link with the bride's family and the past. Many   brides choose to wear a piece of antique family jewelry or a mother's or   grandmother's wedding gown. Something new represents good fortune and success in   the bride's new life. The wedding gown is often chosen as the new item.   Something borrowed is to remind the bride that friends and family will be there   for her when help is needed. The borrowed object might be something such as a   lace handkerchief. Something blue is the symbol of faithfulness and loyalty.   Often the blue item is the garter. A silver sixpence in her shoe is to wish the   bride wealth.\nGiving Away The Bride\nThe father who \"gives away\" his   daughter at her wedding ceremony is following an ancient tradition that has   evolved over hundreds, if not thousands, of years. The custom dates back to the   time when a daughter was considered property, and the groom had to pay a price   to her family before he could be permitted to marry his intended.\nAnother theory is that it symbolized the transition of authority from the   bride's father to her husband as she moved from the parental home to the   conjugal home. Today, many brides follow this custom, but its meaning has   emerged as an outward approval of the groom by the parents or family of the   bride.\nIn old times, female children were deemed to be the property of their   fathers. When it came time for the daughter to marry and her father approved of   the arrangement, he was actually transferring ownership of his daughter to the   groom. Today, the act of giving the bride away is symbolic of her parents'   blessing of the marriage to the chosen groom.\nWomen who consider this tradition archaic, or who have lived independently   for years before their wedding, can eliminate this custom entirely or revise it   to include their mother, brother, stepfather or any other significant member of   the family. Some brides even elect to walk down the aisle alone.\nShoes Tied on the Car Bumper\nBrides' shoes once were   considered to be symbols of authority and possession. They used to be taken from   her when she was led to the wedding place, and given to the groom by her father,   effecting the transfer of his authority to her husband and as a sign that the   husband now had possession of her (and she couldn't run away). The new husband   then tapped her on the head to show his new role as her master.\nIt is obvious why this doesn't continue, but it helps to explain why we tie   shoes to the back of the get-away car. Incidentally, the ever-popular horn   honking has its beginnings in the days when brides traveled in open carriages.   They were an easy target for evil spirits, so defenders would use bells and   firecrackers to scare them away. No chance of any spirits getting in your way --   it's honeymoon or bust!\nCarrying The Bride Over The Threshold\nGenerations ago it   was considered lady-like for the new bride to be, or to appear to be, hesitant   to \"give herself\" to her new husband, whether or not she truly was. At the   threshold to the bridal chamber, the husband would often have to carry the bride   over to encourage her to go in. An older meaning is that during the days of \"Marriage by Capture,\" the bride was certainly not going to go peacefully into   the bridegroom's abode; thus, she was dragged or carried across the   threshold.\nVeils\nThe veil originally symbolized the bride's   virginity, innocence, and modesty. The veil can be traced back to Roman times   when it was a complete head to toe cover (that was later used as her burial   shroud!). This symbolism has been lost over the years but the veil is still   customarily worn. In some Middle Eastern and Asian cultures, the veil was worn   to hide the bride's face completely from the groom who had never seen her. Only   after they were married would the groom be allowed the lift the veil to see his   new wife's face.\nThe White Wedding Dress\nIn biblical days, blue (not   white) represented purity, and the bride and groom would wear a blue band around   the bottom of their wedding attire (hence \"something blue\"). The Greeks are   often associated with white for the wedding dress - they used white robes to   symbolize youth, joy and purity. Despite this, white wedding dresses have not   always been the fashion. In the Middle Ages the white wedding dress was once   again made popular by Anne of Brittany, in 1499 -- they were again supposed to   symbolize virginity. Today, white is an ever-popular color but pastel shades,   stronger colors and even tartars are also worn.\nDiamond Engagement Rings\nIn medieval times, the groom   would most often pay for the bride's hand in marriage. Precious stones were   often included in this payment as a symbol of his intent to marry. While this   practice eventually stopped, the gift of the precious stone as a symbol of   intent remains today.\nThe Ring Finger\nAll wedding and engagement rings are worn   on the fourth finger of the left hand. The vein in this finger was once believed   (by ancient Romans) to go directly to the heart. Pretty obvious symbolism   there.\nMedieval bridegrooms placed the ring on three of the bride's fingers, in   turn, to symbolize, God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit (thought   of as God the Mother or Goddess). The ring then remained on the third finger and   has become the customary ring finger for English-speaking cultures. In some   European countries, the ring is worn on the left hand before marriage, and is   moved to the right hand during the ceremony. However, in most European countries   the ring is still worn on the bride's left hand. A Greek Orthodox bride wears   her ring on her left had before marriage, and moves it to her right hand after   the ceremony.\nWedding Rings\nIn ancient times, when life was much harder   and oftentimes shorter, husbands practiced a superstitious ritual to ensure   their wives' spirits wouldn't leave too soon. The husband would wrap the bride's   ankles and wrists with ropes of grass believing this would keep here spirit   within her. Over the years, as religious beliefs evolved, the meaning (and   material) of the bonds evolved as well. Today, brides thankfully don't bind   their wrists and ankles, only their ring fingers, and grooms have adopted the   practice as well. The grass gave way first to leather, then stone, then metal,   and finally to gold and silver. Today, the rings symbolize the love and bond   between husband and wife.\nThe Bride's Garter\nThe garter from the bride comes from   the ancient custom of witnesses at the marriage bed (to make sure the couple   consummated the marriage); the witnesses would bring it forth as a sign of the   witnessing. It became such a violation of privacy that eventually the bride   would have the groom throw it to prove consummation. This is one of the oldest   customs surviving wedding rituals.\nThe Wedding Cake\nYou might find it interesting that;   originally, the cake was not eaten by but thrown at the bride! It developed as   one of the many fertility traditions surrounding a wedding. Wheat too, is   traditionally a symbol of fruitfulness and was among the earliest grains   (predating rice) to be ceremoniously showered on the bride and groom. In its   earliest origins, the unmarried young women attending the wedding were expected   to scramble for the grains to ensure their own betrothals, much as they do today   for the bridal bouquet.\nEarly Roman bakers, we are told, changed the \"throw it\" to the \"eat it\" tradition. These bakers were distinguished and respected in their trades.   Somewhere around 100 BCE they began taking the wedding wheat and creating small,   sweet cakes with it; the cakes were eaten while the service was in progress.\nFollowing the tradition of eating the crumbs of the wheat, sweet meat cakes   spread throughout Europe. In medieval England the tradition broadened to include   the practice of washing down the cakes with special ale called \"bryd ealu,\" translated as \"bride's ale,\" words that eventually became the word \"bridal.\"\nIn the Middle Ages when food tossing became rice tossing, the once decorative   sweet meat cakes evolved into small biscuits or scones. Guests were encouraged   to BYOB (bake/bring your own biscuit) with them to the ceremony. After the   wedding, leftovers were distributed among the poor. It is those very simple   biscuits and scones that became the forerunner of the elaborate multi-tiered   wedding cake we know today. Legend has it that throughout the British Isles it   became customary to pile the biscuits, scones, and baked goodies on top of one   another in one huge heap. The taller the pile, the more the future prosperity of   the young couple, who exchanged a kiss over the mound. It is told that in the   1660's during the reign of King Charles II, a French chef (whose name,   unfortunately, is now lost) visited London and was appalled at the cake-piling   ritual. It was his idea to transform the messy mound of bland biscuits into a   beautiful work of art, an iced, multi-tiered wedding cake.\nThe Wine/Champagne Toast\nThroughout the ages, wine has   been used for celebration. Often and among many people, wine has signified life,   vitality, love, and a life of plenty. Often and among many people, drinking wine   from a common cup has been the intimate mark of deep sharing. \"Entwined as the   Vine. . . .\" It is also in remembrance of Jesus turning the water into Wine as   his first miracle at the Wedding of Cana in Galilee. It can be celebrated   intimately during the Ceremony between the bride & groom or it can be at the   Reception or both.\nThe feeding of the wedding cake and the wine toast is a derivation of the   Wedding Eucharist nuptial wherein a part of a ceremony is their giving each   other a sup from the Cup of Love and to eat from the Bread of Life and Health   (also see reference under Handfasting for wedding toast nuptial).\nThe Wedding Candle\nThe side tapers are the family or   individual candles. These flames represent you and your ties to your family. The   middle or unity candle represents your marriage and your new family. As the two   flames merge into one and can no longer be separated, so are the bride and groom   joined as one in marriage. The side tapers may be blown out to represent the   start of your life as a couple or remain burning to signify the continued ties   to your family or the retention of your individuality.\nThe unity candle   is not necessarily a religious symbol and is not identified with a particular   religion or denomination, although religious readings or prayers may be   incorporated within unity candle ceremonies.\nThe Blessing Stones\nWhen a wedding is outside and near   water, Blessing or Wishing stones are either gathered at the site or provided by   the couple not only for themselves but for the wedding party and guests as well.   After the ceremony all follow the bride and groom's recessional to the water,   make a wish or blessing for them and cast their stone into the water. The   ripples that are made represent the love and good wishes for not only the   couple, but for all the world... as our ripples cross and re-cross one   another's, so do our love and good wishes touch and retouch all around us and   those with whom we come into contact.\nBridal Showers\nThis event has its roots in Holland. When   a bride's father did not approve of the husband-to-be, he would not provide her   with the necessary dowry. The bride's friends would therefore \"shower\" her with   gifts so she would have her dowry and thus marry the man of her choice. While   dowries are long gone today, the practice of giving gifts to the bride-to-be   remains.\nHoneymoons\nIn ancient times, the Teutonic   people began the practice of the honeymoon. Teutonic weddings were only held   under the full moon. After the wedding, the bride and groom would drink honey   wine for one full moon cycle (thirty days). This \"moon\" (i.e., \"month\") became   known as the \"honey moon.\" While the name survived, the purpose of the honeymoon   changed. After the wedding, newlyweds would leave their family and friends to go   and do what newlyweds are supposed to do. Today that purpose survives, only now   a vacation is incorporated, usually to a romantic get-away   locale.\nFlower Ceremony\nAn ivy wreath is used as the   base (introduced by the minister who will relate it to ivy's traditional   meanings, including the marital connection). Various friends and family members   will add sprigs of various plants/flowers with their traditional or symbolic   meanings related to marriage... building a wreath of flowers in the center of a   circle ceremony or on the altar before or beside the bride & groom.\nCrossed Broom and Sword\nAnother old tradition is for the   couple to jump over a crossed broom and sword (held by the best man and the maid   of honor). This symbolizes the cutting of ties to their parents and the ties   being swept away.\nCeltic Weddings\nMany of the Celtic wedding customs of our   ancestors do not travel very well to our present times. If you break short bread   over the head of the bride or groom as they leave the church what are the   chances that the unmarried youths present will scramble to eat a bit of it off   the ground to insure a good match for their own marriage? Cutting the cake over   the seated bride's head at the reception has replaced this tradition. It was   also customary to salute the bride and groom by firing guns in the air outside   the church. Try that in the suburbs. If you did have your wedding at a venue   where you could use firearms, what statement would you be making? Chances are at   least some of your guests would think you are a gun nut rather than a   traditionalist. Honking the horns of the cars in the procession from the church   replaces the guns.\nRussian Weddings\nRussian   weddings last two days. The official ceremony is just a part of the wedding. The   Bride and groom arrive in separate cars and are lead into separate rooms where   they are to wait until they are called. When they are called they are greeted by   the receptionist in the entry of the registration hall with bread and salt. Then   they are lead into the hall where the actual rites are to be held, they stand on   a special carpet and the official reads a short speech and then asks the bride   and groom if they do. Then there is an exchange of rings, the couples sign in   the registry, and then the witnesses sign and the couple are pronounced man and   wife.\nThe bread symbolizes the hope for health, long life and prosperity. In one   part of the ceremony (at the reception) the bread is bitten into by the bride   and groom, the one who takes the largest bite wears the pants in the family!\nAfter the wedding, it is customary for the wedding party to hop in their   decorated cars and make a tour of their town's historically sites, leaving   flowers at each. There is also \"stealing the bride\", when the groom takes his   eyes off the bride, she might get stolen and the groom will have to pay   ransom!\nChinese Wedding Tea Ceremony\nTea is used because it is   China's national drink and serving it is a sign of respect. Using tea is   practical because not everyone can drink alcohol. Lotus seeds and two red dates   are used in the tea for two reasons. First, the words \"lotus\" and \"year,\" \"seed\" and \"child,\" and \"date\" and \"early,\" are homophones, i.e. they have the same   sound but different meanings in Chinese. Secondly, the ancient Chinese believed   that putting these items in the tea would help the newlyweds produce children   early in their marriage and every year, which would ensure many grandchildren   for their parents. Also, the sweetness of the special tea is a wish for sweet   relations between the bride and her new family.\nOn the wedding day, the   bride serves tea (holding the teacup with both hands) to her parents at home   before the groom arrives. She does this out of respect and to thank her parents   for raising her. The tea at this time does not need to have the lotus seeds or   dates, and the bride does not need the assistance of a \"lucky woman.\" She pours   and serves the tea by herself without the groom. Traditionally, after the   wedding ceremony, the newlyweds serve tea (holding the teacups with both hands),   inviting the groom's elders to drink tea by addressing them by formal title,   e.g. first uncle or third aunt.\nThe general rule is to have the woman on the left side and the man on the   right side. The people being served will sit in chairs, while the bride and   groom kneel. For example, when the newlyweds serve tea to the groom's parents,   the bride would kneel in front of her father-in-law, while the groom would   kneels in front of his mother. The newlyweds serve tea in order, starting with   the groom's parents then proceeding from the oldest family members to the   youngest, e.g. the groom's parents, then his paternal grandparents, then his   maternal grandparents, then his oldest uncles and aunts, and all the way to his   older brother.\nIn return, the newlyweds receive lucky red envelopes (\"lai see,\" which means \"lucky\") stuffed with money or jewelry. The helpers, who are usually women   blessed with a happy marriage or wealth and chosen by the fortuneteller or   bride's mother, also get lucky red envelopes stuffed with money from those being   served. These envelopes are placed on the platter, which holds the teacups.\nIrish\nThe bridal party has many origins, one of which   comes from the Anglo Saxon days. When the groom was about to capture his bride,   he needed the help of his friends, the \"bridesmen\" or \"brideknights\". They would   make sure the bride got to the church and to the groom's house afterwards. The   bride also had women to help her, the \"bridesmaids\" or \"brideswomen\".\nTraditions & Trends\nDo you know   where the ideas for favors at the wedding came from? I don't think anyone has   pinpointed where they came from for sure, however, they have become common   tradition at most weddings you see now days. Here are a few traditions that you   might find fun and interesting:\nJordan almonds , a favorite at most weddings, are centered on Middle Eastern   weddings. This favor dictates that you give 5 pieces to each guest to represent   the five wedding wishes: fertility, health, wealth, happiness and longevity. The   almond is candy coated representing the bitter and the sweet of marriage.\nDecorated eggs are a symbol of fertility for the couple with this Malaysian   tradition.\nGlass charms in the shape of an eye were given on the couples wedding day in   this Greek tradition to protect them from bad luck.\n\"Bridal Sugar\" is a Dutch favor tradition. It is given in sets of 5 cubes to   represent: prosperity, virility, happiness, loyalty and of course love!\nIn the Victorian Era, \"party crackers\" were very popular.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nHow do we start the first dance? In a traditional wedding, ... and toast to the bride and groom. Nowadays, it’s very common for the bride to make a speech as well. Wedding Etiquette and Traditions - Guides for Brides Wedding Etiquette and Traditions\nWedding Etiquette and Traditions\nConfused about wedding etiquette? Wondering which traditions to keep and which to ignore? Don’t worry – we’ve got you covered! From meaningful traditions to strange superstitions, here’s absolutely everything you need to know before your big day.\nWalking down the aisle – who goes first?\nAccording to tradition and etiquette, the bride and groom should lead on the way up to the aisle after the ceremony. They should then be followed by bridesmaids and pageboys, the best man with the maid of honour, the bride’s mother with the groom’s father and then the groom’s mother with the bride’s father.\nHow do we start the first dance?\nIn a traditional wedding, the bride and groom should start off dancing together, then the groom should dance with his new mother-in-law, then his own mother. At the same time, the bride should dance with her new father-in-law and then with her father. The best man should join the dancing, with the maid of honour or chief bridesmaid when the newlyweds first break apart to dance with their in-laws.The rest of the ushers and bridesmaids are also invited to the dance floor at this time. Once the song has finished, all the guests are invited to join the party on the dance floor. \nWant to follow tradition?\nThere are many traditions associated with marriage, and in the past a wedding was seen as a time when people were very open to bad luck and evil spirits. These superstitions began many years ago, and lots are now ignored, but lots of brides choose to honour some traditions that are supposed to bring them good luck. For example, some brides choose to wear something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue on their big day! Another tradition that is supposed to bring good luck is the bride and groom not seeing each other before the ceremony. However, many couples choose to ignore this tradition so they can do a private ‘first look’ before the official ceremony.\nWho gives the speeches?\nWedding etiquette dictates that speeches should be made by the father of the bride, the groom and the best man, in that order. They should try to remember to thank everyone for coming to the wedding, and toast to the bride and groom. Nowadays, it’s very common for the bride to make a speech as well.\nWhat lucky signs should I look out for on my big day?\nAccording to tradition, it is supposed to be good luck for the bride to meet a lamb, dove, spider or black cat on her way to the church. But if she sees a pig or a funeral on her way, these are seen to be bad omens. It is also considered fortunate for the bride to see a policeman, clergyman, doctor, or blind man on the way to the church. \nWhen should I throw the bouquet?\nThe custom of the bride throwing her bouquet shoulder was originally performed by her throwing one of her shoes over her shoulder. After the reception the bride throws her bouquet back over her shoulder where the unmarried female guest group together. Tradition states that the one who catches the bouquet will be the next one of those present to marry.\nDid you know about these strange superstitions?\nThere is a tradition which says that if a bride wishes to be the dominating influence in her married life, she must be the first to buy something after the wedding. The best way to ensure this is to buy a pin from the chief bridesmaid when changing into her travelling costume. Although most weddings now take place on Saturdays, it was once considered an unlucky day to get married. Fridays were also considered unlucky, partially because of Friday 13th. A famous old rhyme advises that a wedding should take place during the first half of the week, saying that Monday brings “wealth”, Tuesday brings “health” and Wednesday is the “best day of all”. \nSharing this article?
