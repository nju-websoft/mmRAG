Also for your information so was the Queen mother, the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.\nThat is interesting as all my research has indicated that Philip brought that line into the BRF as it wasn't there before.\nCould you provide the lineage please as I have never seen one with Elizabeth coming from Charlemagne, only Philip.\n__________________\nPosts: 4,071\nOh! Oh! I can! I can!\nOf course I asked Wisteria for her link and she gave it to me. It's this one. However! One has to register to get the full geneology and as Russo hasn't registered, Russo doesn't have it. Although! The Legend says those dots at the top are all those that the person is decended from and there are 5 Kings up there along with Charlemagne.\nOf course Wisteria will set things right once she comes one, however! I was SO excited about this new toy I had to jump in. Wisteria, I hope you forgive me!\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by Iluvbertie\nThat is interesting as all my research has indicated that Philip brought that line into the BRF as it wasn't there before.\nCould you provide the lineage please as I have never seen one with Elizabeth coming from Charlemagne, only Philip.\nOf course, I have much better sources than this, but on the spur of the moment I found this as I am not that keen on publishing my family tree on the forum but for starters you can look at this.   Google has many references to the royal descendants (and others who are descended from Charlemagne).   Not long ago there was a  site asking for all persons who could prove  (prove is the key word) that they were descended from Charlemagne to add their names to it.\nDescendants of Charlemagne - Familypedia\nTo make it easier for you to search even though there are more links to Charlemagne,  both Prince Albert and Queen Victoria were descended from Charlemagne.\nAs far as the Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (the Queen Mother) the connection (among others) is through Joan Stuart, Princess of Scotland who married John Lyon, Master of Glamis.\nThese are the most simple to find but HM is not descended just through one line but many leading to Charlemagne and many other great Kings.\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by Lumutqueen\nThere are two George Bushs' on the list, one at the bottom, and one just above Barack Obama at the top of what I presume is the next list.\nYou are right Lumut, when I posted they were in another column.\nKotroman, as to why  Charlemagne was introduced to the thread, I was asked by Iluvbertie to give a link to prove that the Queen was descended from Charlemagne.   I think that HMï¿½s family tree has been sufficiently recorded to give her the benefit of the doubt, but as to Mr Jones of the local bakery, well if he has proof!\nNow letï¿½s forget Charlemagne, I did ask for the link to the Presidents to be moved if thought necessary,but I thought  it wass rather interesting for our US members and some of the names are quite surprising.\nThe Monarchist League of Canada: Our Multicultural Monarchy - OUR MULTI-CULTURAL MONARCHY\nwww.monarchist.ca/redbox/ourmulticulturalmonarchy.doc\nAs well as being the great family tree of Canadian history, the Royal Family also connects us directly with the wider panorama of recorded human history, embracing the four corners of the world and many of its races.\nARAB Queen Elizabeth II descends from the Muslims who created the Arab Andalusian civilization of Spain. Since some of those people sprang from the family of the Prophet, the Queen herself is a descendant of Mohammed. When Her Majesty visited Morocco in 1980, the Moroccan media pointed out this Islamuc ancestry of Canada’s Queen.\nARMENIAN The Prince of Wales (Charles) descends from both the medieval Armenian Kings and from the earlier rulers of ancient Armenia.\nAUSTRIAN (and SWISS) All the immediate Royal Family have Habsburg ancestors who came originally from Switzerland, and who created the state of Austria.\nBOSNIAN Stephen Tvrtko, who his made his Kingdom of Bosnia the greatest Balkan power in the Middle Ages, is an ancestor of The Queen through her grandmother Queen Mary.\nBELGIAN Although the modern Belgian state dates from only 1830, the Belgian cultural heritage is that of old Burgundy. The famous Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, is a direct ancestor of Charles, Princes of Wales. Pictures show them looking remarkably alike !\nBYZANTINE GREEK The Duke of Edinburgh (Prince Philip) has the blood of the Angeloi and Sommenoi Emperors of the East as well as of the famous Palaeologus Sovereigns of Byzantium in his veins.\nCHINESE During the visit of Elizabeth II to China in 1986, articles published in the Chinese media traced Her Majesty’s lineage to the Tang Dynasty, whose Emperors provided the Chinese Empire with a period of great peace, prosperity and artistic achievement.\nCROATIAN The Croatian ancestry of The Queen includes the House of Subic. Her Majesty is also descended from several Bans of Croatia.\nCUMAN The Cumans originally lived in southern Russia before being driven west into Hungary by the Mongols. Kutyen, their Khan, is an ancestor of Charles, Prince of Wales.\nCZECH All the Bohemian Kings who left children are ancestors of Charles, Prince of Wales.\nDANISH Through the Duke of Edinburgh (Prince Philip) the Royal Family is Danish in the male line.\nDUTCH William the Silent, Prince of Orange and founder of the Dutch state, is a forebear of Charles, Prince of Wales.\nENGLISH Charles, Prince of Wales, descends from every English King who left descendants except Charles I, Charles II and James II. The Prince’s sons, Prince William and Prince Harry of Wales, are descendants several times over of Charles I, Charles II and James II through their mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales.\nFRENCH Queen Elizabeth II is descended from Saint Louis, who was King Louis IX, the most famous medieval King of France, and from many other Carolingin, Capetian and Valois Sovereigns. Through their mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, Princes William and Harry of Wales are descended five times over from Henri IV, King of France, who sent Champlain to Canada, and who by insisting that commercial activities in the new land be accompanied by settlement, laid the original foundations for the French-speaking community of Canada.\nGEORGIAN Now once again an independent country, Georgia was a Kingdom has long ago as the days of the Greco-Roman world. The Prince of Wales (Charles) descends from many of its ancient and modern monarchs.\nGERMAN German ancestry makes up a good part of the Royal Family’s background. Included in it are the great medieval Emperors and the dynasties of Bavaria, Saxony, Hesse, Baden, Mecklenburg, Brunswick and Anhalt, as well as such famous families as Hohenlohe, Moltke and Trauttmansdorf. Frederick the Great was an ancestral uncle of the Duke of Edinburgh (Prince Philip).\nIRISH Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother brought into the Royal Family the blood of the Dal Cais and Eoganacht dynasties of Munster and that of the Ui Neill High Kings. Charles, Prince of Wales, also descends from Brian Boru, Nial of the Nine Hostages and the Iron Age sacral Kings of Tara.\nITALIAN The Dukes of Savoy, the medieval Kings of Sicily, the Orsini of Rome, the Visconti of Milan, the della Scala of Verona and the Doria of Genoa are among the many Italian families whose blood has come to Charles, Prince of Wales.\nJEWISH Charles, Prince of Wales, descends from the Colonna family who were Jewish in origin. He also has descent from the Khazars (see below) who adopted Judaism as their religion. The Queen and her family enjoy another Jewish descent from an historical figure named Makhir. He was a Jewish Prince of the Davidic Royal House sent by Caliph Harun-al-Rashid as ambassador to the Emperor Charlemagne at the end of the 9th Century. Makhir remained in Europe where he founded a family, one of whose descendants married into the medieval English Royal Family.\nKHAZAR The Khazars formed a powerful state between the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic world. The Queen is descended from Menu Morat, Elteber of the Bihar Khazars.\nLITHUANIAN The Queen is a descendant of Gedimin, the last pagan King of the Lithuanians  who died in 1341.\nMONGOL The Prince of Wales (Charles) is a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. This relationship provides The Royal Family with another link to China, for Genghis Khan’s grandson Kublai Khan became Emperor of China and founder of its Yuan Dynasty.\nNORWEGIAN Harold Haardrade, King of Norway, and the old Norse jarls of Orkney are ancestors of Charles, Prince of Wales.\nPERSIAN Through their mother, Princes William and Harry of Wales descend from Arsakes Vologaeses V Dikaios Epiphanes Philhellen, sacral King of Parthia, and of the Parthian Royal House of Arsaces who ruled Persia (Iran), Mesopotamia and Babylon (Iraq). The Parthian kings claimed descent from the earlier Achaemenid Dynasty. If true, this relationship makes the young Princes descendants of Cyrus the Great, and establishes a blood link with Classical Greece.\nPOLISH The original Piast Dynasty and Jagielonian Kings up to Sygmunt I (d. 1548) are all ancestors of The Prince of Wales (Charles). During her visit to Poland in 1996, The Queen made public reference to her Polish royal ancestors.\nPORTUGESE Alfonzo, Duke of Braganza, is an ancestor of The Royal Family. The Holy Constable who secured Portugal’s independence is also an ancestor several times over of Princes William and Harry of Wales.\nROMANIAN Queen Mary, grandmother of Elizabeth II, brought Romanian blood into The Royal Family as well as Hungarian. Thus the Queen is descended from Vlad Dracul, Prince of Wallachia and father of the original Dracula !\nRUSSIAN The Prince of Wales (Charles) descends from Peter the Great and Catherine the Great as well as the princes of the Rurik period. The later Russian Emperors through the murdered Nicholas II were close relatives of The Royal Family.\nSCOTTISH King George VI (his grandfather) and the Duke of Edinburgh (his father) together provide the Prince of Wales (Charles) with twenty-two descents from Mary Queen of Scots and over two hundred from Robert the Bruce.\nSERBIAN Serbia’s greatest ruler, Emperor Stephen Dusan, and the first King of Serbia, Stephen I, are both ancestors of The Queen.\nSPANISH Ferdinand and Isabella, sponsors of Columbus’ expedition to America, and the epic Spanish hero El Cid are among the notable Spanish ancestors of Elizabeth II.\nSWEDISH Through Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, his son The Prince of Wales (Charles) is descended from the Peace Kings of Uppsala and the rulers of Sweded in the age of the sagas, as well as many other of the historic figures of that land.\nUKRANIAN Elizabeth II is 31st in direct descent from Volodymyr Monomachus, ruler of the Ukraine.\nWELSH As is appropriate for a Prince of Wales, Charles is descended from Llywelen the Great and most of the Welsh Kings and Princes back to the time the Romans left Britain.\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by battle\nCHINESE During the visit of Elizabeth II to China in 1986, articles published in the Chinese media traced Her Majesty’s lineage to the Tang Dynasty, whose Emperors provided the Chinese Empire with a period of great peace, prosperity and artistic achievement.\nThis line has not be substantiated. It beseemeth me that the genealogies of Central Asia hold the key to this conundrum.\nIf the line stands they are, more importantly, descendants, not just  relations, of this Chinese Emperor. I only wish the Chinese people who  made this claim had provided us with a line on which they base their claim.\nRootsWeb\nA guess and an observation. The guess --  it's through the Turks. AFAIK its the Eastern Turks who have Chinese  affiliations and the western Turks who can be traced further west  (though not to Europe to my knowledge) -- but an East-West connection  doesn't sound unlikely. The observation -- the T'ang were descended from  an ephemeral Liang dynasty. Maybe this is the starting point of the  ancestry rather than the main T'ang line. It would certainly be  interesting to know the details of this claim.\nhttp://news.rootsweb.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2004-01/1073628486\n> During the visit of HM Queen Elizabeth II to China in 1986, articles> published in the Chinese media traced Her Majesty's lineage to the Tang\n> Dynasty of China.\n> Can anyone here build a bridge to the 10th century on this?

Katchik-Gagik (Vaspurakin) 908-943/4\nKhatchik (note that this is the same name as his probable descendant below) or Gagik II Artsrouni, King of Vaspurakan (908\n- 943/44).  He was born in 879 and d. 943/44.  His wife was Mlke, see commentary above (Toumanoff, p. 91).\nThe _Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium_ (III: 2154) transliterates his name as Xac'ic and says that he was crowned king of\nVaspurakan by the Muslims in opposition to the Bagratid king Smbat I.\n>\n> Abu as-Sahl Hamazasp III  958-972\nAbu Sahl or Hamazasp III, Prince Artsrouni (958/59 - 969).  He married Gaday, of uncertain parentage (Toumanoff, p. 91).\n>\n> Derenik\nNothing is known of this Derenik but Toumanoff considers him to definitely be a son of Hamazasp (Toumanoff, p. 91).\n>\n> Katchik I, Pr. T'ornavan 1042\nKhatchik I \"le Sourd\", Prince of Tornavan from an unknown date until his death in battle, 1042 (Toumanoff, p. 92).\nToumanoff gives only a dotted line from him back to Derenik which usually means he is guessing or going on very vague\nevidence.  Since Khatchik is known to be an Artsrouni I imagine he grafted him on to the place that fit best in the main\nArtsrouni family tree.\n> Hasan\n> Abul Gharib, Gov. Tarsus\nByzantine Governor of Tarsus, ca. 1075 to aft. 1080.  (Toumanoff, p. 92).  There seems to be no evidence for the forename\nHasan.\n>\n> daughter m. Auschin I (Lampron), ob. ca. 1110\nGiven as \"N. Ardzouni, d. of Abul'gharib, Governor of Tarsus\" by Rudt-Collenberg (_R, H & L_, Chart II [H1]).  Toumanoff\ngives the same filiation (Toumanoff, _Manuel de Genealogie_, pp. 92-93).\nFrom Oshin I, Lord of Lampron, to Elizabeth II of Great Britain is rather well-trodden ground so I have not bothered to\ngive any specific details on the people in this chart other than in places where there are errors.  For the generations\nbefore Oshin I have included more details as the line seems more uncertain.\n>\n> Hetum II, ob. ca. 1143\n> Auschin II, 1125-70\n> Hetum IV, ob. 1250\n> Alix m. Balian d'Ibelin\nThe 1279 marriage date given below actually applies to this marriage (Rudt-Collenberg, _R, H & L_, Chart II [H1]).\nThe generations from Alix of Lampron back to Oshin (or Auschin as in this chart) I, Lord of Lampron, are sound\n(Rudt-Collenberg, _R, H & L_, Chart II [H1]).\n>\n> Guy d'Ibelin\n> Alix d'Ibelin m. (1279) Hugh de Lusignan\nHugh & Alix are nos. 1592-1593 of \"A Medieval Heritage\" and ought to be listed in the next issue of _The Genealogist_ (the\nlast issue ended on 1591).  They did not marry in 1279 but instead on 18 Jun 1318 (see Rudt-Collenberg, _The Rupenides,\nHethumides & Lusignans_, Chart XI [I]).\n>\n> Jacques I m. Helvis of Brunswick\n> James I de Lusignan m. Charlotte Bourbon\nHis name was Janus, not James, see Sturdza, _Dictionnaire_, pp. 616-617 & \"A Medieval Heritage\", No. 398.\n>\n> Anne de Lusignan m. Louis (Savoy)\nPierre I de Luxembourg, Comte de St. Pol (1390-1433) married Margherita del Balzo (1394-1469), daughter of Francesco del\nBalzo, Duca di Andria, & Sueva Orsini (Thompson & Hansen, \"A Medieval Heritage\", Nos. 392, 393, 786 & 787).\nThe incorrect connection between Pierre I and Marguerite is due to a confusion of Pierre I with his grandson & namesake\nPierre II (c.1439-1482) who DID marry Marguerite di Savoia (1439-1483), daughter of Ludovico and Anne above.  Note that\nthis daughter is not given in my old series edition of ES Band II although a daughter Maria who married Pierre II's father\nLouis as his second wife is given.  Some explanation and confirmation from primary sources would be nice to unravel this\ntangle.\nSee: ES (old series) II: 112; Sturdza, _Dictionnaire_, pp. 616-617; \"A Medieval Heritage\", Nos. 196-197.\n>\n> Margaret m. Peter (Luxemburg) 1390-1433\n> Louis\nThese two generations should be eliminated.  See above.\n>\nSources\nRoyal descent really is not all that bizarre. I would say that most Americans who had English or Scotch ancestors in the US prior to 1800 would probably have multiple royal  descents. The fact is, kings had children, like any other person. Those children had children and so on. By the third generation or so, those second and third and fourth sons were marrying into local families. They formed the upper and middle classes. True, because of that, their heritage was usually much better recorded than those of the masses who may not have had access to scribes and clergy on a level that the middle and upper classes did.\nBecause of the male primogeniture inheritance laws in England and Scotland, this class who were descendants of kings but no longer royal or even noble made up a large part of the first wave of immigrants to the US. They had the money and/or means to do so and there was nothing to keep them in the old countries. They came here like everyone else--to start a new life. \"Peasants\" did not start arriving in the US en masse until later, although that does not mean that the \"royal\" descendants who arrived early did not have \"peasant\" descents as well, because they did have those too. This group was already a very mixed lot and formed part of the original base of the human melting pot that is the United States.\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by Hereditary Thane\nThis is always a fascinating topic, though a minfield. The legitimatists always amuse me; they come from families that acknowledge salic law and morganatic marriage, yet are happy to be \"claimants\" through female lines to the Stuart inheritance. Isn't it a fact that there are legitimate dynasts (should they wish to claim it) descended from Charles I Stuart ancestors who have long been British subjects. This is all academic as the Act of Settlement is to all intents and purpose part of the constitution of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nYes, there are many descendants of the last English king, Harold Godwinson in Britain and the Commonwealth.\nActually, the reason the Jacobites can make their claim through the female line is precisely because there is no salic law in Britain.. and because a Queen Regnant had been established in England long before the Stuart kings arrived on the scene.. beginning with Mary Tudor. The fact that the \"heirs\" lived in a country where salic law was recognized is irrelevant, as the claim would have been under the jurisdiction of the laws of Britain.\nThe Jacobites had no choice but to follow the \"legitimate\" line of succession, which it would have been if the Stuarts had not been ousted from power.\nThat claim would have fallen to Henrietta Anne, Duchess of Orleans, and her heirs. She was the youngest daughter of Charles I, and the only person who could make a claim to the throne after the male line of Stuarts failed.\nThere was no one else. James I was the only child of Mary, Queen of Scots. Charles I was his only surviving son. Charles II had no legitimate heirs.. and James II's line ended with Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart.\nHenrietta Anne had two daughters. On the death without issue of Marie Louise, Queen of Spain, the claim then fell to her sister, Anne Marie, Queen of Sardinia.\nWhat the British did was to name Sophia of Hanover as the heir because she was Protestant and was the niece of Charles I.\nIn her case, she had lots of siblings.. but four of them never married, one drowned at 15, one married but had no issued, one was excluded because he was Catholic, and her brother Charles Louis, Elector Palatine, had divorced his wife and entered into a bigamous marriage with another woman. His only legitimate son died without issue as well.\nCharles Louis did have a daughter, but her only son married the illegitimate daughter of Louis XIV, which I suppose also put him out of the picture.\nI don't really view the claims of the Jacobites as any different from the claims of Henri, Count of Paris, to the French crown.. except of course, that there is no longer a French crown.\nIf Prince William ditches Kate Middleton in favor of Princess Marie-Caroline of Liechtenstein, then the whole thing can be put to rest\n. He'd have to wait a few years, however, since the Princess is only 14!\n(that last part is a joke\n)\n\n"
