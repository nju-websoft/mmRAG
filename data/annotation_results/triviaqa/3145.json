Is it a sin for a woman to wear pants? - Tripod.com Is it a sin for a woman to wear pants?\nIs it a sin for a woman to wear pants? \nThe Question:\nIs it a sin for a woman to wear pants? MUST women always wear dresses?\nThe Answer:\nDeuteronomy 22:5 (KJV) - The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman�s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.\nDeuteronomy 22:5 (NIV) A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for the LORD your God detests anyone who does this.\nThe argument about whether it is sinful for a woman to wear pants is based primarily on this verse, stating that pants \"pertain\" to a man, so it is unholy for a woman to wear them. It is interesting that in Biblical times neither men nor women wore pants or trousers as in our culture today, so to brand all trouser-like garments as \"pertaining to a man\" and sinful for a woman to wear shows an ignorance of history and customs.\nBiblical men and women wore robes, and the closest thing to our pants of today was when women pulled their skirt tails between their legs to the front, tucked into their girdle and formed a kind of pant to work in the fields. Yet I don't ever hear someone proclaiming that men ought to wear robes and NOT pants, as this originally was a form of women's clothing!\nExodus 20:26, 28:42-43 \" And do not go up to my altar on steps, lest your nakedness be exposed on it- Make linen undergarments [breeches] as a covering for the body, reaching from the waist to the thigh. Aaron and his sons must wear them whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister in the Holy Place, so that they will not incur guilt and die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants.\"\nLeviticus 6:10 The priest shall then put on his linen clothes, with linen undergarments [breeches] next to his body, and shall remove the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed on the altar and place them beside the altar.\nLeviticus 16:4 \"This is how Aaron is to enter the sanctuary area: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. He is to put on the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments [breeches] next to his body; he is to tie the linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are sacred garments; so he must bathe himself with water before he puts them on.\"\nSome say that these verses prohibit women from wearing pants. In the KJV these garments are called breeches, which is an old fashioned way of saying trousers or pants. However the newer translations have the more correct translation \"undergarments\".\n\"Breeches\" or undergarments in the Hebrew is miknac {mik-nawce'} from kamac {kaw-mas'} a primitive root, to store up, save (Qal) stored up (participle) in the sense of hiding.  It is translated in the KJV as \"breeches\", but literally means underwear, drawers, trousers, specifically a priestly undergarment of linen, which were clearly special undergarments worn by the priests ... not pants as men wear today.\nAnd there is no indication that the average man wore these, just the priests. Notice in Leviticus 16:4 that these were \"sacred garments\" only worn for special occasions, and that the man had to wash himself before putting them on. The reason for wearing them was not to expose the priest's nakedness as he climbed the steps to the altar.\nRevelation 1:6, 5:10 -and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father--to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen...You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.\"\nSome even go so far as to say women aren't allowed to wear ANY \"crotched garments\", even underwear. I certainly don't think it's modest to go about in a dress without underwear. If anything, since we are a nation of kings and priests unto God, ALL of us, these verses would promote the wearing of underwear I would think.\nAs for undergarments, bras are a relatively new invention. Does that mean it isn't holy to wear them? I remember when burning your bra was a big deal (in the sixties) ... and how sinful many church people thought it was NOT to wear one! It's always amusing to me how people pick and chose what parts of the Bible, especially the Old Testament, with which to whack you over the head.\nDeuteronomy 22:5 (KJV) - The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman�s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God. Leviticus 18:22 (KJV) - Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. Leviticus 20:13(KJV) - If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\nSo if Deuteronomy 22:5 doesn't specifically address whether women should wear pants or not, what does it mean?\nI've been thinking of the wording in Deuteronomy 22:5 ... \"things which pertaineth to a man\" ... or woman ... what are the distinctive things that a man or woman wears that defines their sexual identity? In Biblical days, both men and women wore robes and tunics ... so their garments were not that different... the woman's was longer and she wore a veil after marriage when outside the home. How do we apply that today? Not so easy really ... Should we make men wear shorter tunics and women longer ones?\nThe Hebrew word for woman in this verse is 'ishshah {ish-shaw'} translated in the KJV as wife 425, woman 324, one 10, married 5, female 2, meaning woman, wife, female:  woman (opposite of man), wife (woman married to a man), female (of animals), each, every (pronoun). It comes from 'iysh {eesh} translated in the KJV man 1002, men 210, one 188, husband 69, any 27, meaning man, male (in contrast to woman, female), husband, human being, person (in contrast to God), servant, mankind, champion, great man, whosoever, each (adjective).\nIn Genesis 2:23 the 'ishshah/'iysh combination is used, kind of a play on words: The man said, \"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called `woman' ['ishshah] for she was taken out of man ['iysh].\"\nThe word for man in Deuteronomy 22:5 verse is not what you would expect ('iysh), but geber {gheh'-ber} translated man 64, mighty 2, man child 1, every one 1; meaning man, strong man, warrior (emphasizing strength or ability to fight).\nThe Hebrew word here translated \" shall not wear that which pertaineth\" is one word: k@liy {kel-ee'} translated in the KJV, vessel 166, instrument 39, weapon 21, jewel 21, armourbearer + 05375 18, stuff 14, thing 11, armor 10, furniture 7, carriage 3, bag 2, misc 13. It means an 1a) article, object (general) 1b) utensil, implement, apparatus, vessel: implement (of hunting or war); implement (of music); implement, tool (of labor); equipment, yoke (of oxen); utensils, furniture 1c) vessel, receptacle (general);1d) vessels (boats) of paper-reed.\nThis would indicate to me that the garments referred to here would be specifically those implements of male attire suited to a warrior, emphasizing strength or ability to fight. In other words, garments and implements that make a woman resemble a male warrior.\nThe word used for \"women's garment\" is simlah {sim-law'} (through the idea of a cover assuming or resembling the shape of the object beneath); translated in the KJV as raiment 11, clothes 6, garment 6, apparel 2, cloth 2, clothing 2; meaning wrapper, mantle, covering garment, garments, clothes, raiment, a cloth. This would refer to garments that make the man resemble the shape of a woman.\nSince elsewhere the Bible declares that homosexuality is an abomination to God, and also a man dressing to assume the form of a woman, or a woman dressing to assume the shape and likeness of a male warrior, then it is clear that Deuteronomy 22:5 is referring to what we call transvestitism or cross-dressing, a deliberate attempt to appear as the opposite sex, primarily for sexual purposes.\nAre there any verses that give specific directives as to how women should dress? I have heard some say that the only garment that is appropriate for women to wear is the modern-day long dress.\nI Timothy 2:9 (KJV) In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;\nI Timothy 2:9 (NIV) I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.\nThe word for \"apparel\" in I Timothy 2:9 according to Strong's concordance is katastole {kat-as-tol-ay'} meaning 1) a lowering, letting down 2) a garment let down, dress, attire. Vine's has this to say about katastole: \"connected with katastello, to send or let down; hence, dress, attire, in GENERAL (cp stole, a loose outer garment worn by KINGS and persons of rank, - Eng. stole); I Tim 2:9, \"apparel\"\nSome use the term \"apparel\" in this verse in I Timothy 2:9 to attempt to claim that women should always wear dresses, and ONLY dresses.  But the word translated as apparel in the KJV refers to a long, loose fitting, outer garment worn by both men and women.\nI fail to see in this definition the idea of a \"woman's dress\" as we know it in modern times. The emphasis should be on modesty in our attire ... Even a dress that goes from neck to ankle with long sleeves can be sexy ... Modesty is somewhat in the eyes of the beholder, you might say.\nModesty in Greek is kosmios {kos'-mee-os} translated in the KJV as modest 1, of good behavior 1; meaning well arranged, seemly, modest. In the dictionary, modest is defined as 1. Having or displaying a moderate estimation of one's own talents, abilities, and value. 2. Shy and retiring in disposition. 3. Observing conventional proprieties in speech, behavior or dress: DECOROUS. 4. Quiet and humble in appearance: UNPRETENTIOUS. 5. Not extreme: MODERATE.\nI Timothy 2:9 (NIV) I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.\nFurthermore Paul qualifies what he means by \"modest apparel\" by using the words decency and propriety. Decency in the Greek is aidos {ahee-doce'} translated in the KJV as shamefacedness 1, reverence 1; meaning a sense of shame or honor, modesty, bashfulness, reverence, regard for others, respect. Propriety in the Greek is sophrosune {so-fros-oo'-nay} translated sobriety 2, soberness 1; 3 meaning 1) soundness of mind 2) self-control, sobriety, from sophron {so'-frone} meaning 1) of a sound mind, sane, in one's senses 2) curbing one's desires and impulses, self-controlled, temperate.\nSo our decisions about what we wear should include regard for others and how they react to our garments, plus present an appearance designed to control and curb desire. There is also the idea of appropriateness of our clothing to a specific situation. What may be modest attire on the beach may not be appropriate for a church service or a formal dinner. Also, we should not follow our culture's penchant to try to be \"sexy\" or to \"attract\" the opposite sex.\nPaul also includes cautionary remarks about overdoing jewelry and hairdos. Roman women spent hours on their toilette and often had many slaves to help them. Their garments were extremely ornate, embroidered, and costly, and their hair was dressed with elaborate braiding and jewels. They dressed to show off their wealth and social status and to draw attention to themselves. This Paul admonishes us not to do.\nI Timothy 2:9 (NIV) I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.\nPaul also goes on to say that godly women should adorn themselves with good deeds that give honor to God. That is, we should be more concerned with the inward man and bringing honor to God than attracting undue attention by our attire.\nPeter echoes this idea in I Peter 3:3-4: Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.\nThe bottom line on women's clothing is that what constitutes \"modest apparel\" is one of those \"doubtful disputations\" that Paul talks about in Romans 14, and application in our times and culture is a matter of the heart before God. It's one of those things that can sidetrack us and shipwreck us if we aren't careful.\nI think the most Biblical guideline for women's (or men's) clothing is that it not INTENTIONALLY provoke lust ... so I'd rule out skimpy, short, tight, etc also... As in all things, lust is usually in the eyes of the beholder ... and a long skirt wouldn't deter a spirit of lust! I also don't set myself up as judge on someone else's dress code ... because of my stand on Christian liberty!\nHowever, I'm opposed to someone dictating what anyone should or should not wear, stating, \"Well PAUL said you MUST wear a flowing DRESS 10 inches below the KNEE\" or you're naked or something! Women didn't even wear dresses, as we know them in Paul's day. After all if clothing were ESSENTIAL for salvation, why did God create Adam and Eve without it?\nI'm all for letting the Holy Spirit guide believers in their dress ... and putting the emphasis on the inward man ... that's the part that will last forever.  And not to go to extremes, as one very dear lady said one time in a Sunday School class, where we were discussing whether Christians should wear jewelry or not: \"I was always taught that the more you took off for God, the closer you would get to Him\". My comment was \"Then the closest you are to Him is when you are in the shower!\"\nI come from a denomination that once went overboard on the dress issue in the past. Modesty starts in the heart not in the length of skirt thereof! And I have no problem with women wearing pants or even tasteful shorts. I believe God looks on the inward man. This issue so easily gets into legalism. Sanctification has little to do with dress or lack thereof ... \"clothesline preaching\" won't win anyone to Christ.\nAll files �1999-2001 Karleen E.

Google images on “Evzones” “fustanella” “Tanoura” and “Beefeaters ... Should Women Wear Pants? - Anne Elliott. Should Women Wear Pants?\nYou are here: Home / Blog / Bible study / Should Women Wear Pants?\nShould Women Wear Pants?\nby Anne 44 Comments\n“Anne, does Deuteronomy 22:5 mean that women should not wear pants? I mentioned this to a few friends, and they say that no, it just means we shouldn’t look like a man. My pastor’s wife is a very, very sweet woman that I look up to, and she says the same.\nHowever, the more I read the verse, the more confused I become. At the same time, I am not a skirt or dress person. We have a small farm, and I am always in sneakers, jeans, and a sweatshirt or t-shirt. What is your view on the subject?”\nFirst, let’s look at Deuteronomy 22:5 —\n“A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for YHWH your God detests anyone who does this.”\nObviously, the argument against pants is that pants are “men’s clothing” and that skirts are “women’s clothing.” The opposing argument is that when these words of Moses were penned, both men and women wore robes. The difference was in the cut, the style, the fabric, and even the accessories.\nSo by simply reading the passage and using common sense, I think that what God detests is when I try to look like a man, or when a man tries to look like a woman.\nEllen DeGeneres\nEllen DeGeneres is a known lesbian, and I’ve been casually paying attention to her for the past few years.You can see that she intentionally makes a statement, by her clothing and hair style alone, that she is the same as a man. I think she would be proud of wearing “men’s clothing.”\nNow humor me for a moment, and see a picture of Ellen with her “wife,” Portia de Rossi. Do you see how feminine this other woman dresses?\nThis bothers me! This honestly makes me want to go put a skirt on and never, ever wear pants again!\nI told this to my husband, and he said, “Why?”\n“Because I want to make a statement with my life, too! I want to make a statement as loud as Ellen’s, that my life belongs to God and that I am a woman, just as He created me to be.”\nHe pointed out to me that I can make a statement like that even with pants on.\nHe’s right, but depending on where I live and the culture surrounding me determines how easy that will be. You see, pants aren’t inherently evil, in and of themselves. They can’t be, if for no other reason than the fact that men in Moses’ time wore “skirts” (robes).\nObviously, this is a cultural issue. I don’t mean that God’s Word is only applicable in certain cultures. No, God’s commands are written for us to obey! I simply mean that we are to appear feminine in OUR culture, not in Moses’ culture or in early 1900’s culture. How to appear feminine might even vary from country to country, from city to city, or from church to church.\nAm I obviously a woman, in my circumstances and surroundings, to those who are looking at me?\nIf I had a farm, with barns and muck and mud, I don’t see how it’s wrong to wear pants. If I’m playing with children on a cold, Minnesota basement floor, I don’t see how it’s wrong to wear pants — as long as I look distinctly different from my husband and other men. Just from looking at the pictures of Ellen and her “wife,” I can get ideas of ways I can wear distinctly women’s clothing, even pants, by just being sure that the cut is feminine, the details and colors and jewelry are feminine, my hair style and coverings are feminine, etc.\nSometimes pants are even better than skirts.\nWork sometimes requires that we “ gird up our loins ,” so sometimes when I’m working, pants are better than skirts.\nAs you can see from the woman in this photo, she’s got an awful lot to carry. She’s got no hands left to hold all her skirts, so she just tucks her skirts up into her belt and takes off on her way. Here in America, we’d just trade in the skirts for a soft pair of blue jeans, so we could get our work done with nothing in the way.\nSometimes it’s easier to obey God’s command to cover ourselves when we wear pants. In Exodus 28:42-43 , God told Aaron and his sons to wear pants under their priestly robes so that when they ministered at the tabernacle and went up the steps of the altar, they wouldn’t uncover their nakedness and “incur guilt.” Even if we don’t choose to wear pants, it might be wise to slip a pair of pants or leggings under our skirts, so that we are covered.\nWe need to be sure that our skirts don’t prevent us from acting in love toward our sisters in Christ. We are not to look down on others over “disputable matters” ( Romans 14 ). Dressing in a way that makes me look masculine, because I don’t want to act like a woman created by God — that is NOT a disputable matter. However, the particular method I use to look feminine — that IS a disputable matter. Getting mistaken by a stranger for a man, or worse, being mistaken as a lesbian, would be a terrible insult to God. However, I sometimes get the feeling that I am being “sized up” by other Christian women, to determine how “spiritual” I am by how I am dressed, no matter how distinctly feminine I may be in my clothing.\n“My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don’t show favoritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, ‘Here’s a good seat for you,’ but say to the poor man, ‘You stand there’ or ‘Sit on the floor by my feet,’ have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?” (James 2:1-4).\nFinally, sometimes our husbands have opinions of how we can look most feminine, beautiful, modest, or appropriate. I firmly believe that my husband’s opinion should have first place in my clothing decisions!\n“Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior” (Ephesians 5:22-23).\nI don’t say this lightly! A few years ago, an acquaintance was asking a group of her friends about how she short she should cut her hair. Her husband overheard the discussion and came over. He lovingly took her hair in his hands and said that he loved her hair and wished she would grow it long for him. She mocked him in front of all of us and scheduled an appointment to get it cut short. I’m sad to say that they are divorced today, and I can’t help but wonder if her independent and disrespectful attitude was the root of their problems.\nIsn’t this the very attitude that is at the root of wanting to dress like a man? It hurts our pride to “submit” to any man. It hurts our pride to admit that we aren’t as strong as men, that we can’t do anything they can do (and better!), that we shouldn’t be allowed to be pastors or deacons or speak and teach in the church — and on and on and on. We uncover our heads in the church, cut our hair short like men, and wear clothes that show our equality.\nAnd with our rebellious attitudes, we tear up our marriages, our homes, our churches, and our societies. God’s answer? He “detests” this.\nMy plea to the Christian women reading this is that their clothing, hair, make up, and outward appearance would make it obvious that they serve a Living God.\n“Do everything without complaining [about having to dress like a woman] or arguing [with Christian sisters about their clothing choices], so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe” (Philippians 2:14-15).\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nThey use a Greek word from 1 Timothy ... shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, ... they are both the same kind of animal, you cannot mix garment ... Doctrines: Women Must Wear Only Dresses - Bernie Parsons Doctrines: Women Must Wear Only Dresses\nThat     Women Arrange Themselves With Well-Arranged Clothing \nBernie Parsons 06/25/03 \nThere are those within the churches of Christ that     are taking up a doctrine that has been espoused for a few years by certain denominations.     It has to do with how women in the church dress themselves. The doctrine being advanced     has to do with the kind of a garment that women must wear. \nThese advocates proclaim that the New Testament     teaches that Christian women must wear a dressand not just any dress, but one     that is long and flowing. They use a Greek word from 1 Timothy 2:9 to argue their case.     The word is katastole, rendered in the King James Version as apparel, which they claim is properly translated long and flowing. Therefore, they     say, a Christian woman is commanded to wear a long, flowing dressany other garment     is a violation of this sacred commandment. Here is the partial context from which the word     is lifted: \n1 Timothy 2:8: I will therefore that     men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. 9: In like manner     also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and     sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; 10: But (which     becometh women professing godliness) with good works. 11: Let the woman learn in silence     with all subjection. 12: But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over     the man, but to be in silence. \nAccording to Vines\nExpository Dictionary of New     Testament Words, here are some of the Greek words in verse 9, and what he says that they     mean: \nAdorn (kosmeo) means to arrange, to put     in order 1 Timothy 2:9\nModest (kosmios) means orderly,     well-arranged (harmonious) 1 Timothy 2:9\nApparel (katastole) (variation of katastello, which is kata, down, and stello, to send)     means to send down, and is used as a general term for clothing in N.T., as both     Jewish men and women wore robes. 1 Timothy 2:9 \nUsing these definitions, the verse can be rendered     along these lines: \nIn like manner also, that women arrange     themselves in well-arranged clothing, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided      hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;\n\"\nIn a similar manner to men lifting up holy hands     without wrath and doubting, women are to arrange themselves in well-arranged clothing.     This accompanies a demeanor and attitude that reflects modesty, humility, and seriousness.     That is the context of these verses. Verse 9 says, In like manner also, and     refers to the manner of the holy, faithful, and calm men who worshipped and praised God.     The context is not what particular garment to wear, but is descriptive of demeanor, of     comport. \nThere is no evidence that the word katastole denotes     only a long, flowing dress, as some suggest. It is indicative of robes in general, which     were worn by both men and women. The Jews did not wear European/American style dresses.     Therefore, if one were to legalistically render this verse as a command to wear a     particular garment, the garment would be a robe, not a dress. \nThere are some who claim that katastole means     a floor-length, a below-the-knees length, or a to-the-knees length dress (not a robe).     This is preposterous, beginning with the fact that there is no consensus of agreement     among those promoting this theory as to which length is acceptable. Furthermore, there is     only a slight similarity between European/American womens dresses and the Jewish     robes. If our brothers and sisters insist that the garment itself (the shaped piece of     cloth) is the issue, why do they not all wear robes (both men and women), as did the     Jews? \nClothing styles change. They also vary from one     culture to another. God does not specify the style of clothing to be worn. The only time     He did so was when He designated the types of garments to be worn by the priests, under     the Law of Moses. (By the way, they wore under-shorts (breeches), girdles, bonnets, and     coats, along with their robes.) The same people who command women to wear dresses usually     also condemn men's wearing of shorts! Yet some of those same people will quote Exodus 28 as     proof that the men are to wear the britches (breeches), and not the women. Should the men     also wear girdles and bonnets, but not the women? \nExodus 28:2: And thou shalt make holy     garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty. 3: And thou shalt speak unto all     that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make     Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.     4: And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a     robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for     Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's     office. \nExodus 28:39: And thou shalt embroider the     coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the     girdle of needlework. 40: And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make     for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty. 41: And     thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them,     and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's     office.\n42: \"And thou shalt make them linen breeches to     cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:\n43: \"And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his     sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near     unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it     shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him. \nActually, this is a description of the holy     garments to be worn only by the priestsand it had to be of linen, and no other     material. The priests were forbidden to wear these garments among the general     populacethey were to be worn only at the altar, or in the holy area of the     tabernacle. \nLeviticus 6:10 \"And the priest shall put on     his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the     ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put     them beside the altar.\n11: And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the     ashes without the camp unto a clean place. \nLeviticus 16:3 \"Thus shall Aaron come into     the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.     4: He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his     flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be     attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put     them on.\nLeviticus 16:23 \"And Aaron shall come into     the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on     when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there: 24: And he shall wash his     flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his     burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself,     and for the people. \nThe linen breeches of the priesthood were thigh-length undergarments, only worn by the priests, and only while serving in the     tabernacle. They were removed, and other clothes were worn, when leaving the holy area.     There is no record that Israelites in general, either men or women, wore linen     under-pants. \nMany who argue that women must wear dresses and     men must wear pants ask: What about Deuteronomy 22:5? Doesnt this plainly     state that women cannot wear pants? After all, arent pants mens clothing,     while dresses are womens clothing?\nThere are several things wrong with this argument.     Here is the verse in question: \nDeuteronomy 22:5: The woman shall not wear     that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all     that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God. \nFirst of all, we are no longer bound to observe     the Law of Moses, as the New Testament scriptures plainly teach. Jesus came to fulfill the     Law of Moses. \nMatthew 5:17 Think not that I am come to     destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. \nColossians 2:14 Blotting out the handwriting     of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,     nailing it to his cross; \nRomans 7:4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also     are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another,     even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. 5: For     when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our     members to bring forth fruit unto death. 6: But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the     oldness of the letter.\nGalatians 3:24 Wherefore the law was our     schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 25: But after     that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. \nIf we are going to bind some of the Law of Moses,     must we not then bind it all? \nGalatians 5: 3 For I testify again to every     man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 4: Christ is become of     no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from     grace. \nJames 2:10 \"For whosoever shall keep the     whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. \nGalatians 5:18 But if ye be led of the     Spirit, ye are not under the law. \nAll Christians should be aware of this teaching,     and should not try to bind teachings from the Law of Moses.  \nFurthermore, if we keep one part of the Law of     Moses, we are indebted to keep the entire law. For starters, look at the surrounding     verses in Deuteronomy 22. \n5: The woman shall not wear that which     pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so     are abomination unto the LORD thy God.\n6: \"If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in     the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam     sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:\n7: \"But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and     take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy     days.\n8: \"When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt     make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man     fall from thence.\n9: \"Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers     seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be     defiled.\n10: \"Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass     together.\n11: \"Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts,     as of woollen and linen together.\n12: \"Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four     quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself. \nYou cannot take the mother bird along with the     little birds, or the eggs! When is the last time you heard that commandment hotly     debated? \nWhen you build a new house, you must build walls     on the roof, to keep folks from falling off. If you want to argue dresses, let me come     check out your house, to see if you are in compliance with the battlement requirement! \nYou can only have one kind of seed in the     vineyard, can only plow with two animals if they are both the same kind of animal, you     cannot mix garment materialoops! Get rid of those cotton/polyester blend clothes!     And your cover has to have fringes all the way around it! \nThe context is that men are not to pass themselves     off as women, or women as men! By the way, this is also forbidden under the law of     Christ. \n1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the     unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators,     nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with     mankind, \nRomans 12: 26 For this cause God gave them     up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which     is against nature:\n27: \"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural     use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which     is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was     meet. \nThe Bible teaches that women should not try to be     like men, nor should men try to be like women. We must not use this argument to command     that a particular style of clothing must be wornor not worn! \nThe context of 1Timothy 2 is that of godly men and     women who purify and humble themselves before God, and who conduct their lives in true     holiness.  \nIf we are going to bind the customary style of     clothing of the Jews on women, should we not also do this for men? Should not all     Christian men wear dresses, as well? Oh, thats right, the Jews wore robes, not     dresses! Should not all Christian men wear robes, as well as all Christian women? If robes     are less revealing and more proper for women, would not the same hold true for men? \nFallacies of the dresses only arguments: \n(1)   We     do not live by commandments from the Law of Moses.\n(2)   The     Jewish women wore robes, not European/American style dresses.\n(3)   The     Jewish men wore robes, not pants.\n(4)   Katastole translates as to send down, not as long & flowing.\n(5)   Even     if it did, how long is long? To the knees? Below? To the ankles? Or floor?\n(6)   The     context is for godly demeanor, not cut of cloth. \nThe arguments are endless, as it always is when we     choose legalistic arguments rather than trying to understand the spiritual message. Some     argue that culottes are not acceptable, while others who press for dresses     only say that they are a type of a dress. Some say that skirts and blouses may not     be worn, because blouses are form-fitting, not long and flowing. Others say      that blouses are     merely mens shirts renamed to make them acceptable.  \nThen there is the argument that pants are     Gods authorized clothing for men. The scriptures indicate that the Israelites wore     robes, not pants.  \nExodus 20:26 \"Neither shalt thou go up by     steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon. \nWas God concerned that someone might look up the     priests pant-legsor up his robe? \nFor those who claim that pants are     Gods designated form of outerwear for men, a quick study of the history of pants     will set the record straight.  \nGodly men and women should conduct themselves in     purity and humilitythis includes how they dress. That is what God demands. Let us     not go beyond what is written regarding modesty by defining for God a cut of     cloth that He did not define for us.\nLove, in Christ,\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nConfronting the Objections of Trouser Tyrants ... It might simply confirm their prejudicial belief that a man wearing ... Sean Connery; Greek fustanella ... Confronting the Objections of Trouser Tyrants - Introduction Confronting the Objections of Trouser Tyrants\nMen in Kilts, Men's Skirts,  Sarongs and Other Kilt-like Clothing\nKILTMEN.COM - HOME OF THE BRAVEHEARTS\nHome | Advice & Support | Forums | Photos | Links | Movies | Opinion | Suppliers | World MUGs\nConfronting the Objections of Trouser  Tyrants - Introduction\nHow to handle objections from wives,  family, friends, and others to men wearing kilts, skirts, and other unbifurcated  garments.\nWhere the Challenges Lie\nWe men who wear kilts and other male unbifurcated garments (MUGs) as regular  attire are the new pioneers. We are the trailblazers opening a new world of male  fashion, comfort, and freedom. Like other pioneers exploring unfamiliar  territory, we sometimes find the natives to be friendly, sometimes skeptical,  sometimes fearful, and sometimes downright hostile. A lot depends on the  locality, the kind of people you are dealing with, and the way you present  yourself.\nMen wearing tartan kilts generally enjoy overwhelmingly positive reaction,  almost wherever they go. Thanks in part to Braveheart, most people now  recognize the kilt as masculine clothing. Men going about in Utilikilts and  other types of masculine skirts may not receive the same compliments as those in  tartan kilts, but they usually encounter very little negative reaction from the  general public, and rarely any reaction at all. Unfortunately, the traveling is  not always so smooth.\nPockets of intolerance have been reported in various places in the United  States and Britain, and probably exist in many other countries as well. Even in  friendly territory we may sometimes encounter stares, sniggers, jokes, or  sarcastic remarks. Oh well . . . that's the kind of ignorant nonsense that  pioneers learn to brush aside. People laughed at Columbus and the Wright  brothers, but that didn't stop them. The overwhelming truth that we repeatedly  discover is: The vast majority of the general public simply doesn't care what  you're wearing.\nTherefore, general public reaction is rarely an obstacle to male kilt and  skirt wearing. The biggest obstacles are those closer to home. For example:\nWives and girlfriends. Many women have no objection to - and may    even enjoy seeing - men in kilts and skirts. That is, except when it is    their man! The idea of their husband or boyfriend in a skirt may stir up    an intense, irrational emotional reaction, perhaps based on unconscious fears    and prejudices or other selfish concerns. How can a man deal with this?\nParents and other family members. Fears, prejudices, homophobia, or    misplaced religious objections may be some sources of resistance.\nEmployers and schools. Men's right to comfort and freedom is often    trampled by institutions' excessive concern about \"appropriate\" or \"socially    acceptable\" attire, \"corporate image,\" uniform appearance, and prohibiting    clothing that might cause a \"distraction\" or \"disturbance.\"\nFriends and peer groups. While the general public may politely    ignore what you're wearing, these people definitely will not. In the beginning    you must get through a lot of ribbing - perhaps friendly, but maybe more    hostile than you would like. Maintaining a self-confident, good-natured    attitude is key.\nSome churches. Some religious conservatives habitually twist the    Bible to justify their own prejudices against anything new or different. They    often interpret Deuteronomy 22:5 as a divine condemnation of anything that    they personally regard as \"cross-dressing\" - including women in trousers and    men in skirts.\nThese are the primary enforcers of \"Trouser Tyranny\" in a man's life. The  Trouser Tyrants may vary depending on the particular locality, family, social  group, school, or place of employment. Some men are able to avoid or ignore such  people. If they want to wear a kilt or skirt, they just do it. But for other  men, Trouser Tyrants are a constant, unavoidable challenge. In order to win our  struggle for freedom, we must develop practical strategies to deal with their  objections. This article will offer some suggestions.\nDefining Your Goals\nNowadays,  a woman in the United States and most Western countries can simply say, \"I feel  like wearing slacks (or jeans, or a skirt, or a dress) today!\" and go ahead and do it, with no questions asked. Ideally, a man should also be able to  say, \"I feel like wearing a kilt (or sarong, caftan, or other skirted garment),\" without having to justify himself. But for many men, it isn't that simple.  Merely verbalizing such a desire may stir up a storm of objections. A man might  easily become discouraged, particularly if he is uncertain about his own  feelings on the subject.\nBefore we confront the Trouser Tyrants, it would be helpful to examine our  own attitudes, motivations, and goals regarding kilts, skirts, and other  unbifurcated garments. After all, we are the ones who are challenging the status quo. We know that we may be in for a fight. Therefore, we must  have a clear idea of what we're fighting for. Exactly what do we want to  accomplish, and why?\nThe answers to these questions will depend on each individual. There are many  different reasons why men desire to wear kilts, skirts, and other unbifurcated  garments. Your reasons and goals may not be the same as mine. So, before we  become mired in confusion and controversy, let's clarify where we're coming from  and where we want to go.\nWhile recognizing that individual men are complex and not easily categorized,  it is nevertheless helpful to distinguish the following different approaches to  men's skirt-wearing:\n■ Transgender. This involves men    wearing women's skirts, dresses, and other clothing and accessories, not    primarily for comfort but because they are women's garments. Most men    are fascinated by the magic and sensuality that they observe in the female    image and female clothing, so it should not be surprising that some men want    to try it out for themselves. This approach may or may not involve dressing in    full drag, with wigs, make-up, and fake breasts, and adopting a \"femme\" name.    (Most men couldn't \"pass\" as female even if they wanted to.) The goal may be    to express one's \"feminine side,\" to achieve erotic stimulation, or simply to    have fun at a Halloween party or similar occasion when people dress in    costume. There may be a combination of motives, with varying degrees of    intensity, depending on the individual. This approach is commonly referred to    as \"cross-dressing,\" and it's probably what many people think of when they    hear the term \"men in skirts.\" The Transgender approach actually has nothing    to do with men's fashion at all, since the whole point is to adopt women's fashion instead.\n■ Freestyler. This approach is    based on the premise that men should be free to wear any and all clothing,    without regard to gender - just as women in the United States and some other    countries are now free to do. The goal is \"Fashion Freedom\" - the total    abolition of gender distinctions in clothing. Freestylers openly buy skirts    and dresses in the women's departments and wear them as men. They may    or may not also wear women's slips, panties, pantyhose, shoes, make-up, and    other accessories. They may wear a combination of men's and women's clothing.    The whole point of the Freestyler approach is that gender should not matter.    In actual practice, Freestylers are spread across a broad spectrum between the    following two orientations:\n■ \"Freemen\" - in which women's    skirts or other things traditionally associated with female fashion are given    a masculine presentation or otherwise incorporated into a masculine fashion    statement; and\n■ \"Femme\" - in which women's    clothing and other aspects of female fashion are adopted to present a feminine    appearance. This end of the Freestyler spectrum obviously has transgender    aspects to it, and there is no clear dividing line between this and the    Transgender approach. (For an extensive critique of the Freestyler approach,    see Freestyle -    Freedom or Fiasco? )\n■ Ethnic.  This approach involves wearing unbifurcated clothing -    such as Scottish or Irish kilts, Greek fustanellas, or the robes, caftans, or    sarongs of other countries - as an expression of one's ethnic pride or in    connection with ethnic celebrations or activities. For example, a man of    Scottish descent may wear his tartan kilt while attending Highland games,    Robert Burns dinners, weddings, Scottish dances, or other special occasions,    or while playing the bagpipes or marching in a parade. When most people    encounter a kilted man, they automatically assume that he is Scottish or Irish    and on his way to or from such an event. The rest of the time, most kilts are    hidden in closets or cedar chests and therefore have little impact on men's    everyday fashion.\n■ Braveheart. This approach    involves wearing kilts and other male unbifurcated garments (MUGs) as    ordinary, everyday attire, for reasons of freedom, comfort, and compatibility    with male anatomy. Bravehearts do not desire the freedom to dress in    women's clothing, nor are they concerned with abolishing gender distinctions    in clothing. They strive to maintain a clearly masculine image. Strict    Bravehearts prefer unbifurcated garments that are specifically designed for    men and avoid clothing that is intended for females. Their goal is to open men's fashion to kilts and other MUGs, so that men will be free to wear    these garments everywhere, all the time, and not just for special events.\nWhich of these approaches most closely describes your attitudes and  objectives? Perhaps you identify with more than one. Perhaps your approach is  something altogether different. Whatever it is, you must recognize and  understand it before you can develop supporting arguments. The approach that you  follow will determine the way you address the objections of the Trouser Tyrants,  as well as affecting your chances of success.\nWhen it comes to convincing, or at least neutralizing, the Trouser Tyrants,  some approaches will be easier to \"sell\" than others. It is important that we  understand our adversaries and how they think. We will start with the following  general observations about people who support Trouser Tyranny:\n■ Many are uncomfortable with sexual ambiguity. They want men to be clearly    masculine in appearance and easily distinguishable from women.\n■ Some are religious conservatives who use the Bible to justify their    prejudices about clothing.\n■ Some are homophobic and disturbed by anything that they associate with    homosexuality.\n■  Many get upset when people don't conform to traditional \"norms\" in    appearance and behavior.\n■ Many are overly concerned about appearances and worried about what other    people might think.\n■ Many are worried about how the appearance of another person (spouse,    family member, employee, etc.) might adversely reflect upon themselves or    otherwise cause problems.\nIf  these observations about Trouser Tyrants are accurate, men defending the \"Transgender\" approach might as well save their breath. Cross-dressing is  the epitome of everything the Trouser Tyrants loathe. According to the religious  conservatives' interpretation of Deuteronomy 22:5, it is an \"abomination\" for a  man to put on women's clothing. They believe that God demands a clear  distinction between males and females. In addition, some religious conservatives  see cross-dressing activities in public schools as a plot to promote  homosexuality. In deference to this view, many schools in the United States have  forbidden boys to dress as girls for Halloween or powder-puff football games.\nBut people do not need religious justification to find cross-dressing  objectionable. Discomfort with sexual ambiguity is so common that it probably  has deep psychological or sociological roots. In addition, there may be genuine  and realistic concern that the cross-dressing individual might become the victim  of harassment and even violence.\nLikewise, men advocating \"Freestyler\" principles will come up against  the same objections to men wearing women's clothing. (Freestyling has been  characterized by some as \"cross-dressing lite.\") The concern for safety may also  be an issue - since a Freestyler openly wearing a skirt or dress as a man would make a more obvious target than a man disguised as a woman. These problems  might be mitigated if the Freestyler chooses his outfits carefully and projects  a self-confident, masculine image. However, the Freestyler philosophy rejects  any such limitations. By definition, Freestyling has no boundaries. It stands  for men's freedom to wear anything and everything that women wear, all the way  up to full drag. This is a concept that Trouser Tyrants will never accept.\nIn contrast, the \"Ethnic\" approach would probably be easiest to sell -  particularly if you have the appropriate national heritage to justify it -  because it involves traditional male clothing worn in a limited, clearly defined  context. However, even this is not a sure thing, as indicated by the following  examples which have appeared on the Internet. At a high school in Michigan, a  boy of Scottish descent wound up in detention for wearing his kilt to the  school's \"Ethnic Heritage Day.\" In another case, an Irish-American boy was  disciplined for wearing a kilt to school on St. Patrick's day. A few years ago,  when a male employee of Scottish descent wore a kilt to work at the University  of California-Davis admissions office in honor of Tartan Day, his supervisor  ordered him to remove the kilt and put on jeans instead. The supervisor deemed  it inappropriate for the man to wear a kilt when greeting prospective students  and their parents - even though one of his duties was to praise the  University's policy promoting ethnic diversity!\nThe  Ethnic approach might be a good starting point for some men, including those who  have some Scottish or Irish background or who don't mind pretending that they  do. But it is probably too limited, by itself, to free men's fashion from  Trouser Tyranny.\nThe \"Braveheart\" approach builds on the already established heritage  of ethnic MUGs, such as kilts, but it is not limited to ethnicity or special  celebrations. It is open to the development of new varieties of unbifurcated  garments, such as the Utilikilt, designed and marketed specifically for men. It  provides men with the comfort and freedom of unbifurcated garments without  suggesting that they raid the women's wardrobe. Because kilts and MUGs are male clothing, the thrust of Deuteronomy 22:5 is blocked. Because  Bravehearts emphasize a distinctively masculine appearance, the concerns  about sexual ambiguity are blunted. In addition, the Braveheart philosophy is  supported by rational arguments and pragmatic justifications - as well as the  emotional power of movies like Braveheart and examples of macho male  celebrities proudly wearing kilts.\nUsing the Braveheart approach, we can stake out a defensible moral and  rational position, be consistent, and hold our ground. While there is no  guaranty that the Trouser Tyrants will be convinced, we will at least have a  fighting chance!\nChipping Away at Prejudices\nOvercoming prejudices may take a long time, especially when they have been  institutionalized and internalized for many generations. The following are some  of the prejudices that may be influencing the attitudes of Trouser Tyrants:\n■ The belief that women have lower status than men. Whether or not we    approve of this idea, it has prevailed in nearly all societies throughout    history. Traditionally, men have been regarded as stronger, more intelligent,    more powerful, more free to act than women. This forms the basis for the next    prejudice, which is:\n■ The belief that wearing women's clothing is degrading. A man who    puts on woman's clothing is traditionally perceived as lowering his status and    prestige, relinquishing his power and freedom, or evading his manly    responsibilities. He therefore becomes either a comic figure or an object or    ridicule and disdain. In contrast, a woman who puts on men's clothing is    perceived as raising her status and freedom of action. Examples include    the brave heroine in Beethoven's Fidelio and others in Shakespeare's    plays, who disguised themselves as men in order to perform heroic acts. When    the early feminists began wearing trousers, they provoked outrage not because    trousers were degrading, but because trousers were a \"power symbol\" reserved    exclusively for men.\n■ The belief that skirts are exclusively female. This idea has    prevailed in Western societies for the past few hundred years. Until about 50    years ago, most people also considered trousers to be exclusively male (and    some religious conservatives still do). In medieval times, men could wear    either trousers or unbifurcated clothing like robes and tunics, while women    like Joan of Arc were burned at the stake for wearing trousers. How things    have changed! Although women in the United States and most Western countries    now consider both trousers and skirts to be standard female attire, some of    them feel uncomfortable about giving men the same options. Even though they    themselves rarely wear skirts any more, some women nevertheless want to keep    skirts as their own exclusive property. They consider it unfair to allow men    to wear skirts, because this would diminish skirts' value as a \"power symbol\" of female sexuality.\n■ The belief that wearing skirts promotes effeminacy or homosexuality. This stereotypical thinking assumes that all \"real\" men wear trousers, and    that any man in a skirt is either aspiring to be female or trying to attract a    male.\n■ The belief that deviations from \"socially accepted\" norms are dangerous    or perverted and should not be tolerated.  It is common for people (as    well as other animal species) to be fearful or suspicious of individuals who    appear different from the rest of the crowd. Therefore, most people learn to    follow the herd and blend in with everybody else. In exchange for their lost    individuality, such people find reward in self-righteously upholding and    enforcing prevailing norms and customs.\nPeople  who cling to such prejudices are generally impossible to reason with. Their  preconceived notions have become woven into the fabric of their personalities  and their overall view of themselves and the world. Therefore, we must be  patient and non-threatening in our approach, giving them both time and  incentives to reconsider their views gradually.\nIt would be extremely difficult, and probably impossible, to change all of a  Trouser Tyrant's prejudicial beliefs at once. To be most effective, we must  choose the one or two beliefs that are most susceptible to change and which are  most necessary for achieving our goal. If we follow the Braveheart approach, our  first targets would include the beliefs that skirts are exclusively female and  that wearing skirts promotes effeminacy or homosexuality. (Combating homophobia  is a separate issue, which need not be discussed at this point.) The Braveheart  argument addresses these concerns by distinguishing kilts and MUGs from women's  skirts, by emphasizing their masculinity, and by pointing out that very macho  men have worn skirts throughout history and still do in many parts of the world.  This approach would seem a lot easier than trying to uproot the Trouser Tyrants'  deep-seated prejudice against cross-dressing.\nThe Freestylers object to such gender distinctions. They contend that skirts  are skirts, and that it makes no difference whether the skirt a man wears was  originally intended for men or women. However, when used against Trouser  Tyrants, this argument could easily backfire. It might simply confirm their  prejudicial belief that a man wearing any type of skirt is \"cross-dressing.\"\nSpecific Strategies\nThis article will now suggest strategies to confront the objections of  various Trouser Tyrants, based primarily on the Braveheart approach. Arguments  relevant to the Ethnic and Freestyler approaches will also be included where  appropriate. (These arguments will have little or no relevance to those  following the Transgender approach, who might be more interested in our page on Non-Braveheart Alternatives .)\n_______________________\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nModern Hellenic or Greek Culture?

In modern times, the fustanella is part of Balkan folk dresses. In Greece , a short version of the fustanella is worn by ceremonial military units like the Evzones , while in Albania it was worn by the Royal Guard in the interbellum era. Both Greece and Albania claim the fustanella as a national costume. [1]\nContents\nOrigins[ edit ]\nA young man with a chiton. Roman copy of a Greek original of the 4th century BCE.\nA relief circa 400 BCE depicting the builder of the sanctuary of Vari Cave , Archedemus the Nympholept , wearing a fustanella-like garment.\nSome scholars state that the fustanella was derived from a series of ancient Greek garments such as the chiton (or tunic) and the chitonium (or short military tunic). [2] [3] [4] Although the pleated skirt has been linked to an ancient statue (3rd century BC) located in the area around the Acropolis in Athens , there is no surviving ancient Greek clothing that can confirm this connection. [4] However, a 5th-century BC relief statue was discovered in Vari Cave , Attica , by Charles Heald Weller of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens depicting a stonecutter, Archedemus the Nympholept , wearing a fustanella-like garment. [5] The Roman toga may have also influenced the evolution of the fustanella based on statues of Roman emperors wearing knee-length pleated skirts (in colder regions, more folds were added to provide greater warmth). [6] Folklorist Ioanna Papantoniou considers the Celtic kilt, as viewed by the Roman legions , to have served as a prototype. [4] Sir Arthur Evans considered the fustanella of the female peasants (worn over and above the Slavonic apron) living near the modern Bosnian - Montenegrin borders as a preserved Illyrian element among the local Slavic-speaking populations. [7]\nIn the Byzantine Empire , a pleated skirt known as the podea (Greek: ποδέα) was worn. [8] [9] The wearer of the podea was either associated with a typical hero or an Akritic warrior and can be found in 12th-century finds attributed to Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180). [9] On Byzantine pottery sherds , warriors are shown bearing weapons and wearing the heavy pleated fustanella, including a mace-bearer clad in chain-mail . [10]\nIn his Lexicon of Medieval Latin, Charles du Fresne suggests that fustanum (a piece of cloth) originates from the Roman palla. [11] Cotton fustana was among the belongings of Pope Urban V (1310–1370). [12]\nGreece[ edit ]\nSgraffito pottery fragments from the 12th century showing Greek warriors wearing the fustanella, from Corinth , Greece . [13]\nArchaeological evidence shows that the fustanella was already in common use in Greek lands as early as the 12th century. [13] Byzantine Greek [14] [15] warriors, in particular the Akritai , wearing fustanella are depicted in contemporary Byzantine art . [16] This is also confirmed by akritic songs of the 12th century. [17] The full-pleated fustanella was worn from the Byzantine Akritic warriors originally as a military outfit and seems to have been reserved for persons of importance. [13] [18] It was frequently worn in conjunction with bows , swords , or battle-axes and frequently shown covered with a jointed corselet , or with a vest of chain mail . [13]\nThe fustanella is thought originally to have been a Tosk Albanian costume introduced into Greek territories during the Ottoman period. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] During the Ottoman period, the fustanella was also worn by the klephts and the armatoloi . [25] Fustanella was a suitable garment for guerrilla mountain units, thus it was worn by the klephts of the Ottoman period for the same reason it was worn by the akritai warriors of the Byzantine era earlier. [26] It subsequently became part of the national dress of Greece as a consequence of the migration and settlement of Arvanites in the region. [27] [28] [29] In the early 19th century, the costume's popularity rose among the Greek population. [30] [31] During this era of post-independence Greece, parts of Greek society such as townspeople shed their Turkish-style clothing and adopted the fustanella which symbolised solidarity with new Greek democracy. [32] It became difficult thereafter to distinguish the fustanella as clothing worn by male Arvanites from clothing worn by wider parts of Greek society. [32] According to Helen Angelomatis-Tsougarakis, its popularity in the Morea (Peloponnese) was attributed to the influence of the Arvanite community of Hydra and other Albanian-speaking settlements in the area. [30] The Hydriotes however could not have played a significant role in its development since they did not wear the fustanella, but similar costumes to the other Greek islanders. [30] In other regions of Greece the popularity of the fustanella was attributed to the elevation of Albanians as an Ottoman ruling class such as Ali Pasha , the semi-independent ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina . [30] In those areas, its lightweight design and manageability in comparison to the clothing of the Greek upper classes of the era also made it fashionable amongst them in adopting the fustanella. [30] The fustanella worn by the Roumeliotes (Greeks of the mountainous interior) was the version chosen as the national costume of Greece in the early 19th century. [33] Of the Roumeliotes, the nomadic Greek speaking Sarakatsani pastoralists wore the fustanella. [34] The Aromanians , a Latin speaking people who within Greece also wore the fustanella. [34] During the reign of King Othon I (1832–1862), the fustanella was adopted by the king, the royal court and the military, while it became a service uniform imposed on government officials to wear even when abroad. [35] [36] In terms of geographical spread, the fustanella never became part of the clothing worn in the Aegean islands , while in Crete it was associated with the Independence war of 1821 and as a government uniform. [37] By the late 19th century, the popularity of the fustanella in Greece began to fade when Western-style clothing was introduced. [36] [37] In modern Greece, the garment is seen a relic of a past era with which most members of the younger generations do not identify. [38]\nThe Greek fustanella differs from the Albanian fustanella in that the former garment has a higher number of pleats. For example, the \"Bridegroom's coat\", worn throughout the districts of Attica and Boeotia, was a type of Greek fustanella unique for its 200 pleats; a bride would purchase it as a wedding gift for her groom (if she could afford the garment). [39] A fustanella is worn with a yileki (bolero), a mendani (waistcoat) and a fermeli (sleeveless coat). The selachi (leather belt) with gold or silver embroidery, is worn around the waist over the fustanella, in which the armatoles and the klephts placed their arms. [40]\nDuring the 18th and early 19th centuries, the skirts hung below the knees and the hem of the garment was gathered together with garters while tucked into the boots to create a \"bloused\" effect. Later, during the Bavarian regency , the skirts were shortened to create a sort of billowy pantaloon that stopped above the knee; this garment was worn with hose , and either buskins or decorative clogs . This is the costume worn by the modern Greek Evzones , the Presidential Guard.\nAlbania[ edit ]\nA 14th-century document (1335 AD) listing a series of items including a fustanum (a cloth made of cotton ), which were confiscated from a sailor at the port of the Drin River in the Skadar Lake region of Albania. [41] During the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the late 15th century, Albanian Tosks who arrived in southern Italy wore the fustanella which distinguished them from Albanian Ghegs who wore tight breeches. [42] In the 19th century, within the area of contemporary southern Albania and northern Greek Epirus , British traveler John Cam Hobhouse noticed that when traveling from the Greek-speaking area (region south of Delvinaki ) into the Albanian-speaking area (to the direction of Gjirokastër and its surrounding environs), apart from different languages a change of clothing occurred. [43] Those Albanian speakers wore the Kamisa shirt and kilt, while Greek speakers wore woolen brogues. [43] Other British travelers within the region such as Lord Byron celebrated the Albanian costume and described it as \"the most magnificent in the world, consisting of long, white kilt, gold-worked cloak, crimson velvet gold laced jacket and waist-coat, silver mounted pistols and daggers\". [44] In 1848–1849, British painter Edward Lear traveling within the area of contemporary Albania observed that the fustanella was for Albanians a characteristic national costume. [45] While during the 19th century the use of the fustanella was worn over tight fitting triq pants amongst male Albanian Ghegs by village groups of the Malësorë or highlanders of the Kelmend , Berisha , Shala and Hoti tribes. [46] They reserved use of the fustanella for elites during important and formal occasions such as dispute resolutions, election of local tribal representatives and allegiance declarations. [46] In the middle of the 19th century, Albanian guerilla fighters abandoned the Turkish pants and begun wearing a kilt similar to the fustanella of the Greek Evzones. [47]\nThe Albanian fustanella has around sixty pleats, or usually a moderate number. [48] It is made of heavy home-woven linen cloth. [48] Historically, the skirt was long enough to cover the whole thigh (knee included), leaving only the lower leg exposed. [48] It was usually worn by wealthy Albanians who would also expose an ornamented yataghan on the side and a pair of pistols with long-chiseled silver handles in the belt. [48] The general custom in Albania was to dip the white skirts in melted sheep-fat for the double purpose of making them waterproof and less visible at a distance. [49] Usually, this was done by the men-at-arms (called in Albanian trima). [49] After being removed from the cauldron, the skirts were hung up to dry and then pressed with cold irons so as to create the pleats. [49] They then had a dull gray appearance but were not dirty by any means. [49] The jacket, worn with the fustanella in the Albanian costume, has a free armhole to allow for the passage of the arm, while the sleeves, attached only on the upper part of the shoulders, are thrown back. [48] The sleeves are not usually worn even though the wearer has the option of putting them on. [48] There are three types of footwear that complement the fustanella: 1) the kundra, which are black shoes with a metal buckle, 2) the sholla, which are sandals with leather thongs tied around a few inches above the ankle, 3) the opinga, which is a soft leather shoe, with turned-up points, which, when intended for children, are surmounted with a pompon of black or red wool. [48]\nAmong the Greek population in southern Albania, a sigouni, a sleeveless coat made of thick white wool, is worn over the fustanella in the regions of Dropull and Tepelenë . [50]\nRepublic of Macedonia[ edit ]\nIn the area that is now Republic of Macedonia , the fustanella was worn in the regions of Azot , Babuna, Gevgelija , the southern area of the Great Morava , Ovče Pole , Lake Prespa , Skopska Blatija, and Tikveš . In that area, it is known as fustan, ajta, and toska; possibly because the costume was introduced in the country as a cultural borrowing from the Albanians of Toskëria (subregion of southern Albania). [51]\nStatus and practicality[ edit ]\nWhile the image of warriors with frilly skirts tucked into their boots may seem impractical to a contemporary audience, modern paratroopers use a similar method to blouse their trousers over their jumpboots. [52] Lace was commonly worn on military uniforms in the West well into the 19th century, and gold braids and other adornments still serve as markers of high rank in formal military uniforms. Fustanella were very labor-intensive and thus costly, which made them a high status garment that advertised the wealth and importance of the wearer. Western observers of the Greek War of Independence noted the great pride which the klephts and armatoloi took in their fustanella, and how they competed to outdo each other in the sumptuousness of their costume.\nName[ edit ]\nThe word derives from Italian fustagno ' fustian ' and -ella (diminutive), the fabric from which the earliest fustanella were made. This in turn derives from Medieval Latin fūstāneum, perhaps a diminutive form of fustis, \"wooden baton\". Other authors consider this a calque of Greek xylino (ξύλινο), literally \"wooden\" i.e. \"cotton\"; [53] others speculate that it is derived from Fostat , a suburb of Cairo where cloth was manufactured. [54] The Greek plural is foustanelles (Greek: φουστανέλλες) but as with the (semi-correct) foustanellas, it is rarely employed by native English speakers.\nName in various languages[ edit ]\nNative terms for \"skirt\" and \"dress\" included for comparison:\nLanguage\nA Greek and an Arnaut wearing the Fustanella costume, Russia, 1862.\nMacedonian costumes at the Museum of Macedonia in Skopje.\nSpiridon Louis , Olympic marathon champion (1896).\nAt the carnival in Venice, painting by Mikhail Scotti .\nGreek Presidential Guard officer, Athens.\nArnaut in Cairo, by Jean-Léon Gérôme .\nAlbanian leader Hamza Kazazi , photographed ca. 1858.\nBlack fustanella, worn by Greek Macedonian.\nRoyal Guard of Albania in 1921.\nSouliote warrior, painting by Dupré Louis (1820).\nAromanian shepherd in traditional clothes, photo from the early 1900s, Archive: Manachia Brothers.\nGuard of honour at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Syntagma Square , Athens, 2006.\nChanging of the guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, 2005.\n^ Koço 2004 , p. 161\n^ Smithsonian Institution and Mouseio Benakē 1959 , p. 8: \"From the ancient chiton and the common chitonium (short military tunic), fastened by a belt round the waist and falling into narrow regular folds, is derived the fustanella which by extension gives its name to the whole of the costume.\"\n^ Fox 1977 , p. 56: \"The young shepherd wears a fustanella, descendant of the military tunic of ancient Greece, now rarely worn except by certain regiments.\"\n^ a b c Skafidas 2009 , p. 148.\n^ Weller 1903 , pp. 271–273: \"The figure is that of a stonecutter bearing the tools of his craft, the hammer or pick, and the square.

Though usually remaining linguistically distinct, they participated \"as Greeks\" in the War of Independence and in the further development of the new nation. As a consequence of extensive Albanian settlement, the Greek national dress up until the twentieth century was the Albania foustanella (pleated skirt) with pom-pommed curved shoes called tsarouchia.\"\n^ St. Clair 1972 , p. 232: \"Gradually, more and more Greeks found ways of getting themselves on the Government's pay roll.

It was probably at this time that the Albanian dress made its decisive step towards being regarded as the national dress of Greece. The Government party, being largely Albanians themselves, favoured the dress and a version of it was common among the Greek klephts and armatoli. Now it seemed that anyone who donned an Albanian dress could claim to be a soldier and share in the bonanza.\"\n^ Skafidas 2009 , p. 148: \"The modern fustanella appears in Greece worn by Albanians, and especially the Arvanites, as Greeks of Albanian ancestry were called, most of whom fought alongside the Greeks against the Turks in the long war of independence.\"\n^ a b c d e Angelomatis-Tsougarakis 1990 , p. 106: \"On the other hand, Albanian dress was daily becoming more fashionable among the other nationalities.

In the rest of Greece it was the steadily rising power of Ali Pasha that made the Albanians a kind of ruling class to be imitated by others. The fact that the Albanians dress was lighter and more manageable than the dress the Greek upper classes used to wear also helped in spreading the fashion. It was not unusual even for the Turks to have their children dressed in Albanian costume, although it would have been demeaning for them to do so themselves.\"\n^ Gerolymatos 2003 , p. 90: \"Greek fashion in the nineteenth century saw men dressed in the Albanian kilt while women followed the Muslim tradition of covering themselves up, including the face and eyes.\"\n^ a b Welters 1995 , pp. 59: \"According to old travel books, the nineteenth-century traveler could readily identify Greek-Albanian peasants by their dress.

Othon also made the foustanela a service uniform by imposing it on government officials… Government officials also wore the foustanela abroad, which occasionally led to embarassment… Othon showed less enthusiasm for the foustanela as a military uniform.

Greek was not spoken as it was further south; there was a change in the way of life and manners of the peasants. As one traveller reported Hobhouse 1813: Every appearance announced to us that we were now in a more populous country. (...) the plain was every where cultivated, and not only on the side of Argyro-castro [Gjirokastër]... but also on the hills which we were traversing, many villages were to be seen.

A water-colour of Two Albanians, in a private collection in Athens, can now be related to this group of works (Fig.34).

Delacroix must have intended the latter to serve as mementoes, as records of ethnic types and dress, part of the process of collecting Orientalist visual imagery in which he was engaged in the 1820s. His enthusiasm at the lush beauty of the Albanian costume must have matched that of his favourite poet at the time, Byron. In a letter to his mother from Epirus dated 12th November 1809, Byron had marvelled at 'the Albanians, in their dresses, (the most magnificent in the world, consisting of long, white kilt, gold-worked cloak, crimson velvet gold laced jacket and waist-coat, silver mounted pistols and daggers)...he admitted to having succumbed to the temptation and acquired some of these 'magnificent Albanian dresses...They cost fifty guineas each, and have so much gold, they would cost in England two hundred'.\"\n^ Koço 2015 , p. 17: \"The closely observing eye of the painter Edward Lear, in his travels around Albania in 1848 and 1849, depicted the fustanella as a typical national costume of the Albanians.\"\n^ a b Blumi 2004 , p. 167: \"While quite popular among those who depicted Malesorë life in paintings, the use of the foustanella among Ghegs was basically reserved for formal occasions; it was worn by groups in the Kelmendi, Hoti, Shala and Berisha village groups.
