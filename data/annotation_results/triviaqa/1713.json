The truth about Harold Wilson - after 30 years of scandalous rumours | Daily Mail Online\nThe truth about Harold Wilson - after 30 years of scandalous rumours\nBy ROY HATTERSLEY\nLast updated at 10:12 24 June 2007\nThe real Mary Wilson is dramatically different from the dull suburban housewife who was caricatured so ruthlessly during her husband Harold's years of power.\nHer reputation for doing little more than \"standing by her man\" was acquired in an era before Prime Ministers' wives became personalities in their own right.\nIt was exacerbated by Mrs Wilson's Diary - a long-running spoof in the satirical magazine Private Eye that mocked her apparent meekness and fondness for composing verse.\nMary never complained, and finally faded from public view during the many years she devotedly nursed her husband as he was gradually consumed by Alzheimer's.\nScroll down for more...Today, the \"little woman\" calumny is regurgitated whenever so-called new \"revelations\" about Wilson's premiership - which ended prematurely in 1976 after he resigned under rather mysterious circumstances - are spewed out by one of his \"loyal\" lieutenants.\nBut his widow must also take some responsibility for all the nonsense that is so often written, because she adamantly refuses to take on her husband's detractors. An intensely private woman, she despises the cult of personality that has infested modern politics. And she emphatically does not believe in letting her emotions show.\nNow aged 90, she lives alone in a Westminster flat and observes the world through eyes that have lost none of their sharpness.\nDespite all her years as a political wife (Harold became an MP in 1945), she has rarely talked to the media and has never given a full-blown newspaper interview. That she is giving one at all now - coincidentally, as yet another Prime Minister prepares to step down before the end of his term - is because we have known each other for more than 40 years.\nTime after time, she prefaces her words by saying: \"I have never told this to anyone before.\" But equally, time after time, she stops me from delving any further. It is a matter of principle that she will never retaliate against those who tell lies about her husband by telling the discreditable truth about them.\nOf course, the story that has resurfaced the most persistently pivots on the role of Marcia Williams - now Lady Falkender - who served as Harold Wilson's political secretary for nearly 30 years, including his eight years as Prime Minister.\nIn 2003, Joe Haines, Wilson's former Press secretary, published a book which claimed that Marcia had had an affair with the Prime Minister and that she had treated him with derision.\nOne of his tallest tales - repeated in a BBC drama last year - had Marcia once telling Mary: \"I've slept with your husband six times and it wasn't very satisfactory.\" (Subsequently, the BBC was forced to issue an apology.)\nMary Wilson, who combines moral certainty with the no-nonsense approach of a Northerner, says such allegations are beneath contempt and unworthy of comment.\nWhen I ask if her disdain for scandal-mongering is built on her knowledge that none of the stories are true, she allows herself a contented smile.\nTo understand Mary Wilson's character, it is necessary to know something of her upbringing as \"a daughter of the manse\". Her father, a Congregationalist minister, encouraged plain living and high thinking. (\"Church twice on Sundays and no novels to be read on the day of prayer,\" recalls Mary.) Little wonder, then, that the family watchwords were \"pride\" and \"propriety\".\nHer background also goes some way to explaining why she has never complained about the Cabinet Office's decision, regarded by some as a disgrace, to halve her pension - to Â£15,000 - when her husband died in 1995. All she will say is: \"I have a small annuity.\"\nMary Wilson is part of a disappearing generation that is determined to go through life without whining, blaming and emoting. There is not a trace of self-pity when she describes her husband's final, terrible illness, which became evident after he resigned from office in 1976.\nAs she charts his decline, she gives the lie to the persistent rumour that there was something deeply mysterious about his surprise resignation. Among the more sinister whispers was that MI5 had been about to expose him as a KGB agent.\nAt the time, Harold Wilson was a fixture in everyone's lives: the pipe-smoking PM who had devalued \"the pound in your pocket\", confirmed our membership of the Common Market and predicted the \"white heat\" of the coming technological revolution.\nThere seemed no reason for him to step down - and no convincing explanation was put forward. But the truth, Mary says, is simple. After his unexpected election victory in 1974, \"Harold always meant to go quite quickly\".\nSo why did he choose to make his announcement in the spring of 1976?\n\"He'd had enough. There was a seamen's strike, which he had just dealt with. He told me that he could not deal with it with the same level of energy, the same zest . . . and, possibly, he began to feel that his memory was going.\"\nWe will never know whether Wilson feared the early onset of Alzheimer's or if he thought he was just growing old - though, at 60, he was still a comparatively young prime minister.\nBut the truth is that he felt he could no longer do the job in the way that he wanted.\nAfter the hand-over to Jim Callaghan, four good years followed before the brilliant mind began to go. I remind Mary of a story that Callaghan told me about his own investiture as Knight of the Garter in 1980, attended by the Wilsons.\nCallaghan said: \"Mary was marvellous. She spent every moment looking after Harold. Got him in and out of all those robes and chains. She couldn't have enjoyed it much herself.\"\nThis triggers difficult memories.\n\"I've never told anyone this before,\" says Mary. \"At the beginning, when Harold knew that he couldn't remember, he was very distressed. But the time came when he didn't remember at all and we settled down into a sort of calm.\n\"It was a very quiet time after he got over his anxieties. Sometimes, he would say: 'I must go home. My mother and father [long since dead] aren't well.'\n\"So I would just take him out for a walk round the block. Strangely enough, it became a very calm period.\"\nLeading up to that time, there was also the half-world between memory and oblivion when Wilson (by then Lord Wilson of Rievaulx) was still intent on attending the House of Lords.\n\"I'd take him early in the afternoon. Jim Callaghan would make room for him on the [Privy Councillors'] bench. Harold would keep an eye on me, sitting down there with the other peers' wives. After about an hour, I'd give him a thumbs-up sign and he'd come out for me to take him to tea.\"\nBut then the hard work - she dismisses the notion of suffering or sacrifice - began. It is only when we come to her recollections of Wilson's last few months that there is a rare expression of resentment.\n\"Roy Jenkins was the only one [of his old Cabinet ministers] who came to see him. And he wasn't even still a member of our party.\" (Jenkins had defected to help found the SDP).\nMy suggestion that people find it hard to deal with Alzheimer's produces a flash of steel.\n\"Then they should try harder!\" Yet it was all worth it. \"Above all, I didn't want him to go into a home. He stayed here with me right until the last two days, when he had to go into hospital.\"\nHer devotion has never wavered. Pictures of him - Oxford don in cap and gown, young President of the Board of Trade, grave and greying Prime Minister - stand on every table and bookshelf in her living room.\nShe shows me the hand-written poem that she composed to mark her husband's funeral in the Scilly Isles, where they had spent many enjoyable family holidays:\n\"My love you have stumbled slowly\nOn the quiet way to death\nAnd you lie where the wind blows strongly\nWith a salty spray on its breath\nFor this men of the island bore you Down paths where the branches meet\nAnd the only sounds were the crunching grind\nOf the gravel beneath their feet And the sighing slide of the ebbing tide\nOn the beach where the breakers meet.\"\nMary Wilson has published three volumes of verse and has always turned to poetry during times of crisis and disappointment.\nThe first of these was when she decided not to go to university - because it would have been an expense too far for her father.\n\"I have regretted it all my life,\" she tells me. \"All my life.\"\nInstead, she enrolled in a business college and became a secretary in the Lever Brothers soap factory at Port Sunlight.\nIn the summer of 1934, Harold Wilson - preparing to go to Oxford University - visited the tennis club where she was a member. He claimed it was love at almost first sight. But Mary says she took much longer to make up her mind.\nHarold Wilson and Gladys Mary Baldwin were married in January 1940. He had just been elected a Fellow and she neither expected, nor wanted, to become a political wife. And perhaps that sowed the seeds of her second great regret.\n\"I loved being the wife of a don and would have been happy to remain one all my life,\" she says.\nBut fate intervened. After wartime service as a high-powered civil servant, Wilson (who had joined the Labour Party as a student) was nominated as candidate for a constituency no one expected him to win.\nOn the crest of the 1945 Labour landslide, he was swept into Westminster - and so began one of the most meteoric careers in parliamentary history.\nWithin months, Wilson was a parliamentary secretary and, in 1947, at the age of 31, was promoted to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. Every step up the ladder came as \"rather a shock\" to Mary.\n\"I didn't know a thing about [the business of politics].\" But she was never the passive little woman of Mrs Wilson's Diary.\nIndeed, there were spirited arguments with Clement Attlee, Labour's greatest Prime Minister, about historical figures. \"Bad choice, bad history,\" he told her, when she leapt to the defence of her heroes (Bonnie Prince Charlie, Charles II and Lord Byron).\nAnd, in 1975, she had the courage to follow her convictions and vote against one of her husband's flagship policies.\nHis government had decided to let the people decide, through a referendum, if Britain should confirm its membership of the Common Market. After the Wilsons had returned to their ministerial car from the polling booth, Mary told her husband: \"I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it.\"\nWilson had voted for Britain to remain in Europe, and his wife had voted to come out. \"He was very sweet about it,\" says Mary.\nAsked if she still holds the same view, the best she can say about Britain's European destiny is: \"You can't unscramble eggs.\"\nMary insists that she enjoyed her role in Downing Street, though she hated the house. \"Everybody who has lived there seems to. I missed my real home, where I was cook, mother and gardener.\"\nWas that one of the reasons why, after winning the 1974 election, the Wilsons chose to stay at their flat in nearby Lord North Street rather than move back into \"that little flat upstairs\"?\n\"We knew that even if we moved, we wouldn't be in Downing Street for long,\" she says, confirming that even at the moment of victory, Harold's departure had already been planned.\nDespite her dislike of Number 10, Mary Wilson says that she \"adored Chequers\". Intriguingly, she says she plans to send a letter to Gordon Brown's wife, Sarah (whom she describes as \"splendid\"), urging her to persuade her husband to change his mind and use the Prime Minister's Buckinghamshire country residence at weekends.\nShe is far too canny and discreet to give her views on Tony Blair, but her comment: \"After you've left the bridge, you don't spit on the deck\" may provide a clue to her feelings. As, indeed, does her admission that she is \"Old Labour\".\nAs for how Cherie Blair has performed in the role of Prime Minister's wife, she says: \"We all see things differently, and times have changed.\" Then, conscious this remark sounds frosty, she adds: \"Cherie has been very kind to me. I like her very much.\"\nThroughout her own years as a prime minister's wife, Mary Wilson was sustained by two great friendships: the poet John Betjeman, who was \"a breath of fresh air\", and Marcia Falkender, who particularly helped her though the early days.\nMary says: \"She was a real politician. I wasn't. She knew all the ropes. Marcia never decided my diary - I decided where to go for myself - but she was a great help.\"\nThe women remain the firmest of friends and lunch together almost every Wednesday - most often in the House of Lords - and talk \"both about the old days and what's going on now\".\nThe sincerity of her affection for Harold's former political secretary cannot be doubted. Since Lady Falkender had a minor stroke five years ago, I have never met Mary Wilson without being given a bulletin about the health of her long-standing friend.\nScroll down for more...\nSo why will she not denounce Lady Falkender's detractors? \"I just don't talk about such things,\" she replies.\nOnce again, her tone is overlaid with contempt. However, she does paint a vivid scene from the Downing Street years that provides a kind of answer.\nOne of Lady Falkender's detractors, she says, once \"went absolutely wild\" because he was required to canvass during a General Election campaign after a lunch of no more than cold ham. \"He was very unpleasant to the Downing Street housekeeper.\"\nClearly, being unpleasant to the staff is regarded by Mary Wilson as unforgivable.\nBut the offender's name, she tells me, must not be mentioned. She holds the view that you cannot complain about character assassination if you wield the assassin's knife.\nWhat, I ask Mary, are her happiest memories? The greatest joys, she says, were the births of her two sons. And the worst? Election defeats - but only because of the disappointment they caused Harold.\nAnd, of course, the slow realisation that he was suffering from an incurable disease which, she believes, was worsened by a (successful) operation in 1980 for colon cancer.\n\"Afterwards, he was never the same again.\" How has she coped since his death? Faith has helped, she says. So has the support of her sons and their families. And, of course, her stern upbringing as a daughter of the manse has taught her to face pain with fortitude.\nBut, most important of all have been her memories of Harold, the lasting legacy of a close and happy relationship.\nShe says that during moments of doubt and sorrow, she still \"talks\" to him. \"Sometimes, just inside my head  - sometimes, when I am alone, out loud.\"\nThree or four times a year, she returns to the Scilly Isles. One of these visits is an annual pilgrimage and act of remembrance, with a service at the Methodist church where Harold's funeral was held. This is followed by a graveside reading from John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.\nHarold Wilson was lucky to have found Mary. Without him, she might have done more and better in the eyes of the world, but she is in no doubt that she was equally lucky to have found him.\n\n"
