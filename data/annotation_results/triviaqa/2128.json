David Beckham (1996-2009, 115 caps, 17 goals)\n© Getty Images\nWhile there are more technically gifted players than Beckham that have been omitted from this selection, few have given as much to the Three Lions as the 39-year-old did. Having made his debut in September 1996, Beckham's international career had its fair share of highs and lows.\nHe made himself public enemy number one by getting sent off during the defeat on penalties to Argentina at the 1998 World Cup, but he atoned for that by scoring a stoppage-time goal against Greece that saw England qualify for the 2002 World Cup in dramatic fashion. During that tournament, he then laid the Argentina ghost to rest by scoring from the penalty spot in a 1-0 win during the group stages.\nThe 39-year-old made the last of his 115 appearances in an England shirt in 2009, while he retired from club football last year. Among his honours are league titles from England, Spain, the USA and France, as well as a Champions League medal from Manchester United's success in 1999.\n9. Gary Lineker (1984-1992, 80 caps, 48 goals)\n© Getty Images\nEngland has arguably not produced a more natural converter of chances than Lineker, who retired from international football in 1992 just one goal shy of Sir Bobby Charlton 's England record.\nThe now-Match of the Day presenter had a habit of finding the net at the World Cup, so much so that he was the tournament's leading goalscorer in 1986 with six goals and is still the only Englishman to have won the Golden Boot. He followed that up by scoring four more times in 1990, taking his overall total in World Cups to 10 - a tally only six players can beat.\nHe was equally prolific at club level, scoring goals on a regular basis for Leicester City, Everton, Barcelona, Tottenham Hotspur and Nagoya Grampus Eight.\n8. Bryan Robson (1980-1991, 90 caps, 26 goals)\n© Getty Images\nThere are those who believe that England could have gone even further in 1986 and 1990 had Robson not suffered tournament-ending injuries, such was the impact that the midfielder had on the team.\nNicknamed 'Captain Marvel', Robson was an energetic midfielder, famed for scoring important goals, as well as having a fierce competitive streak.\nAfter starting his career with West Bromwich Albion, Robson went on to win the majority of his honours with Manchester United. When he departed Old Trafford in the summer of 1994, he did so having lifted the Premier League twice, the FA Cup three times, the League Cup once and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup once.\n7. Geoff Hurst (1966-1972, 49 caps, 29 goals)\n© Getty Images\nSuch is the good fortune required on occasions to succeed as a footballer that Hurst may not have been included in this list had Jimmy Greaves not suffered an injury against France during the 1966 World Cup. With Greaves sidelined, Sir Alf Ramsey turned to Hurst, who grabbed his opportunity with both hands.\nHe scored the only goal of the quarter-final victory over Argentina before famously firing in a hat-trick against the West Germans during the final.\nThe 72-year-old is also revered among West Ham United supporters having scored 242 goals during his 13-year stint at Upton Park. The centre-forward scored during the 1964 FA Cup final as the Hammers defeated Preston North End, while he also featured in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup success a year later.\n6. Gordon Banks (1963-1972, 73 caps, no goals)\nThe International Federation of Football History and Statistics rated Banks so highly that they voted him as the second best goalkeeper of the 20th century behind only Lev Yashin and above Dino Zoff .\nHe kept goal during England's success in the summer of 1966, keeping four clean sheets and making numerous stops during the final against the West Germans. Yet, he produced his finest individual moment for the Three Lions four years later. Playing against Brazil, a cross from Carlos Alberto was met by a powerful header from Pele . It seemed that everybody was waiting for the net to bulge, but a diving Banks somehow managed to get his hand on the ball to flick it over the crossbar. It's widely regarded to be one of the best saves ever made.\nAt club level he won the League Cup twice, as well as being voted FIFA's Goalkeeper of the Year six times.\n5. Tom Finney (1946-1958, 76 caps, 30 goals)\nFormer Liverpool manager Bill Shankly once said of the Preston North legend: \" Tom Finney would have been great in any team, in any match and in any age, even if he had been wearing an overcoat.\"\nFor a while, one-club man Finney was England's leading goalscorer along with Nat Lofthouse , before both were surpassed by Charlton in 1963.\nHis recent death at the age of 91 was met with great sadness, with tributes being paid by some of the biggest names in football. At Preston's Deepdale ground there is a statue of the winger, who made 473 appearances for the Lancashire club, as well as a stand named in his honour.\n4. Stanley Matthews (1934-1957, 54 caps, 11 goals)\nStan Mortensen may have scored a hat-trick for Blackpool in the 4-3 victory, but the 1953 FA Cup final will forever be known as 'The Matthews Final'. With the Tangerines 3-1 down with 35 minutes remaining, Matthews's tricky wing play helped spur his side on to win the trophy.\nSuch was his dedication to the game, he played until the age of 50 with Stoke City, while his last England appearance came against Denmark eight years earlier. There was even a clamour by some journalists for him to be chosen for the 1958 World Cup when he would have been 48, but the selectors refrained.\nPerhaps his greatest achievement, though, was being named the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or award in 1956, pipping the likes of Alfredo di Stefano , Raymond Kopa and Ferenc Puskas to the prize.\n3. Duncan Edwards (1955-1958, 18 caps, five goals)\nBut for the tragic events on a Munich runway on February 6, 1958, it's highly likely that Edwards would have topped this list. Along with eight of his Manchester United teammates, the left-half, just 21, died after a plane taking the team home from a European Cup tie in Belgrade crashed as it attempted to take off.\nIt's of course difficult to truly gauge just how good Edwards would have been, but many of those that saw him up close believe that he could have been the greatest ever.\nFinney once said: \"He was so strong people could only see the power, but he had a most delicate touch. It is very sad to think what he might have done if he had been allowed. Unquestionably he would have been in the very highest rank.\" Meanwhile, Charlton, who played alongside Edwards with England and United, added: \"You see, he was so good, when he was around you thought anything was possible. He was more than a great player. Sometimes he seemed like some bright light in the sky. He was a giant, and even today his loss is the hardest thing to bear.\"\n2. Bobby Moore (1962-1973, 108 caps, two goals)\n© Getty Images\nWest Ham's Hurst and Martin Peters may have scored the goals that won England the World Cup, but their club teammate Bobby Moore was the cornerstone of a well-organised defence. Captain of the team, the centre-half remains the only Englishman to have lifted the World cup.\nIn days leading up to the tournament in Mexico four years later he was controversially arrested in Colombia, where England had played a warm-up match. It was alleged that he had stolen a bracelet but, with no evidence, he was released and went on to feature as the holders reached the quarter-finals. Earlier in the competition, he produced a memorable challenge to stop Brazil's Jairzinho in full flow.\nAfter his death in 1993, Pele said: \"He was my friend as well as the greatest defender I ever played against. The world has lost one of its greatest football players and an honourable gentleman.\"\n1. Bobby Charlton (1958-1970, 106 caps, 49 goals)\nNo player has scored more goals for either England or Man United than the 76-year-old, which is reason alone for him to top this selection.\nHe survived the Munich air disaster of 1958 and a decade later captained United to the club's European Cup success on an emotional night at Wembley, where he scored twice during the 4-1 victory over Benfica. On top of that triumph, he also won the First Division title three times and the FA Cup once.\nDuring England's run in 1966 he scored both goals in the win over Portugal at the semi-final stage, with his performances throughout the tournament resulting in him winning the Ballon d'Or that year ahead of Eusebio .\nEngland will face Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica in the group stages of this summer's World Cup, and you can follow every match live with Sports Mole.\nContinuing our 50-day countdown to the tournament, we will be looking at the greatest players in France's history tomorrow.

Why didn’t he sign for Fergie? Is Shearer really as good as G-Nev? And is he fed up  of talking about his on-pitch ‘evacuation’?  James Maw  asks all...\nby\nPublished\n20 November 2015\nThere are few mugs more recognisable to the people of England – football fans or otherwise – than that of Gary Lineker. Scoring a near-record 48 goals for his country, presenting Match of the Day for 16 years and appearing in more quirky advertisements than the PG Tips chimps has made Lineker one of the most famous men in the country.\nFACT FILE\nFull name: Gary Winston Lineker\nDate of birth: 30/11/1960\nPlace of birth: Leicester\nHeight: 5ft 9in Position: Striker\nClubs: 1978-85 Leicester City 216 games (103 goals); 1985-86 Everton 52 (38); 1986-89 Barcelona 138 (52); 1989-92 Tottenham 138 (80); 1992-94 Nagoya Grampus Eight 24 (8)\nInternationals: 1984-92 England: 80 (48)\nClub honours: Second Division 1980; Copa del Rey 1988; Cup Winners’ Cup 1989; FA Cup 1991\nIndividual: Footballer of the Year 1986, 1992; World Cup Golden Boot 1986\n“The massive change for me was after Mexico 86,” Lineker tells FourFourTwo. “Before then, although I’d done well at Leicester and had a great season at Everton, I could still just about go about my business. But after that first World Cup, I couldn’t go anywhere without being jumped upon – it was a different world.”\nNo wonder. Six goals that summer won Lineker the Golden Boot and earned him  a move to Barcelona. “Obviously it’s not quite the same now,” he says, settling down for our chat, “although being on TV every week means you get recognised by a new generation.”\nThere’s a lot for us to get through, then…\nI read that one of your schoolteachers said you “wouldn’t make a career from football”. What do you think you would have done had he or she been proved right?\nEarl Stewart, Chesterfield\nIt’s true, I think it may have been my chemistry teacher who said it. I was particularly useless at chemistry – I just couldn’t get my head around it. If I hadn’t made it as a footballer, I would have at least tried to become a cricketer. If I’d failed there too, I think I would have had a bash at journalism, which I suppose is ultimately where I’ve wound up anyway. I’m not sure I would have been given quite the same opportunities without the football, though.\nLineker forged a strong partnership with Alan Smith at Leicester\nI wasn’t an instant superstar like Michael Owen or Wayne Rooney – I was 21 or 22 before I was a regular in the Leicester team\nHow tough was it to break into the Leicester team at first? Was it intimidating to have a lot of competition up front?\nPatrick Russell, via Facebook\nIt’s always tough when you break through as a youngster. I first got my chance playing out of position on the wing. I probably played my first 30 games out there, basically because I was pretty quick. I wasn’t an instant superstar like Michael Owen or Wayne Rooney – I was 21 or 22 before I was a regular in the Leicester team, and didn’t play for England until I was 24. Mine was a more gradual rise, but I think that helped me. It’s easier to cope with the change of becoming famous if that happens over time rather than just overnight.\nDo you feel you have to hide your affection for Leicester a bit now you’re the ‘neutral’ host of Match of the Day?\nLinda Martin, via Facebook\nNo, not at all. We’re not dealing with the world of politics here; we don’t have any need to hide our allegiances. I don’t think people expect us to, either. Obviously you’ve got to be sensible with it – I can’t push Leicester to first on Match of the Day every week! Most people are critical of their own team because they care so much, but if they see somebody else being critical, they get very defensive. It’s almost like family: you can slag your brother off to kingdom come, but if somebody else has a pop, you’ll defend him. If you believed everything you read on Twitter, you’d think we were biased against every club. I’ve even had people accusing me of being biased against Leicester. I’m not sure what they’ve been watching! \nThe local lad started scoring prolifically when the Foxes dropped to the Second Division in 1982\nWe were very unlucky not to win the title in the season I was at Everton, and I think if I’d stayed we would still have won it in 1987\nYou scored 30 goals in one year at Everton, yet they won the title either side of your season there. Is there a danger that sides can be over-reliant on one goalscorer?\nRyan Francis, via email\nNo, I don’t think so. We were very unlucky not to win the title in the season I was at Everton (1985/86), and I think if I’d stayed we would still have won it in 1987. Every team needs a goalscorer – it dramatically enhances your chances if you have someone who can score 30 goals in a season. That Everton team was unquestionably the best club side I played in. We could easily have done the Double in 1986 – we finished second in the league, then lost the FA Cup final. If I’d ended up staying there for three or four years rather than just the one, I’m sure I would have won lots of trophies.\nWould you have stayed at Goodison longer had it not been for the European ban?\nOyvind Fiska, via Twitter\nMaybe. Everton would perhaps have been in a better position to keep me. It was very much Howard [Kendall]’s decision to take the money. When your club tells you they’ve accepted a bid, you take that as a sign that you’re not wanted. The opportunity to join a club like Barcelona comes along once in a lifetime, so I had to take it. It was a shame, because in an ideal world I’d be able to say: “Give me another couple of years at Everton, let me win a few things, and then I’ll go.”\nTrophies and shorts. Short shorts\nAny regrets that the prevailing fashion in your pomp was very short shorts? Looking back at footage of you in your prime is quite revealing...\nTina, Bolton\nThey certainly were short in those days! It’s not something that keeps me awake at night. Looking back now is a bit embarrassing, but they’re only legs – we all have them!\nMaradona’s improvisational skills were something to be admired, I suppose. It’s not something that would enter my head\nHad the opportunity arisen, would you have performed Diego Maradona’s Hand of God at the other end of the pitch?\nTim B, Croydon\nHis improvisational skills were something to be admired, I suppose. It’s not something that would enter my head, which is a sign of the difference in football culture between the continents in that era. Over there it was seen as clever; here it’d be seen as cheating. It’s a different mindset, not something I was ever tempted to do. Now, the cultures have merged. I don’t think you can say the foreign players dive more than British players, for example. That’s what kids have grown up watching.\nIs the Golden Boot right- or left-footed?\n‘Funky’, via Twitter\nGood question. [Pauses] You know, I think it might be a straight boot – so not really a left or right boot. That’s the first thing I’ll check when I get home. It’s my most treasured piece of memorabilia. It changed my life, really.\nThumping home a hat-trick against Poland at Mexico 86\nRECOMMENDED  Lineker: My 1986 World Cup in pictures\nI got a third just after half-time, then Madrid quickly got two back and suddenly I was terrified my moment would be overshadowed by their comeback. Fortunately, we held on\nWho were the best players you played with at Barcelona? Was your Clasico  hat-trick the highlight of your time there?\nJordi Escales, Barcelona\nIt was a transitional phase for the club. I arrived a year after Terry Venables’ team had won the club’s first title in over a decade, and left before Johan Cruyff had put together his ‘dream team’. The club had just lost the European Cup final on penalties to Steaua Bucharest, and while I was there Bernd Schuster left and Juan Carlos Rojo got a really bad knee injury that pretty much ended his career. Andoni Zubizarreta, Migueli, Julio Alberto, our captain Jose Ramon Alexanko, Jose Mari Bakero and Txiki Begiristain were all very talented, but not quite on the level of recent Barcelona sides. The hat-trick (in January 1987) was one of the great nights of my career.\nIt was the first Clasico I played in the Nou Camp, there were 120,000 people there and pretty much every one of them was a Barcelona fan. I scored twice in the first five minutes and the noise gave me goosebumps. I got a third just after half-time, then Madrid quickly got two back and suddenly I was terrified my moment would be overshadowed by their comeback. Fortunately, we held on.\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEGivftftC8?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=http%3A//www.fourfourtwo.com&amp;wmode=opaque\">Embedded video for Gary Lineker: I almost joined Manchester United – but then Spurs pulled it off</a>\nYou were a prolific scorer throughout your career, but if you’d played in Spain now, do you think you’d have been anywhere near Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo?\nStuart Thomas, Isle of Wight\nNo way [laughs]. They’re on a different level to anything else I’ve seen in terms of goalscoring. My record would be better if I was playing now – the rules have changed in ways that benefit attacking players, and the pitches are better too – but to do what those two do is ridiculous. \nTell us something about El Tel in Barcelona…\nGary Dickinson, Blackburn\nTerry Venables’ Spanish was very good. His vocabulary was broad, but grammatically he wasn’t great – a bit like his English [laughs]. He mainly spoke Spanish around the players, but every now and then he’d speak a bit of English and some of the other players picked up the odd phrase. During my time in Spain, England played a friendly away in Madrid. I was playing against half of my team-mates, including the goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta. I scored four, we won 4-2 and after the match Zubizarreta came into the dressing room and cried in this thick cockney accent: “F**kin’ell Gary!” Terry had clearly rubbed off on him.\nHughes and Lineker joined Barça in the same summer\nInstead of coming over to me and saying, ‘I want my own people; maybe we can get you a move that works for everyone’, Cruyff messed me about\nHow surprised were you the first time Johan Cruyff put you on the right wing? Would it be fair to say you didn’t always see eye-to-eye?\nJoe Sprightly, via email\nVery fair! In those days clubs were only allowed two foreign players and it was quite clear from an early stage that Cruyff wanted his own foreign players. That’s understandable, but instead of coming over to me and saying, “I want my own people; maybe we can get you a move that works for everyone”, he messed me about. While he clearly should’ve played me up front, because his system was made for a striker like me, he stuck me out on the right wing.\nHe did it to piss me off in the hope I’d go squealing to the press, but I wasn’t that daft. I understood what he was doing. I knew his game, so I did the professional thing and got on with it. I buggered up my goal ratio that season! He was a great coach. It was fabulous to be involved in his training sessions – he had such innovative ideas. He was a pundit for the BBC at Euro 2000 and we were fine. It’s certainly not something that still bothers me.\nRECOMMENDED  How Johan Cruyff reinvented modern football at Barcelona\nLineker spent three seasons at the Camp Nou\nIs it true Fergie tried to reunite you with Mark Hughes at Manchester United before you moved to Tottenham?\nGraham Whelton, via Twitter\nI was quite open-minded about my next move. It looked like I was going to Fiorentina for a while, but then Sven-Goran Eriksson left and so did Roberto Baggio, so that option went away. Then Terry Venables came along and did a deal with Barcelona very quickly. Right at the 11th hour it suddenly appeared that Spurs might not be able to do the deal, financially. That’s when my agent spoke with Alex Ferguson, who was keen to take me to Old Trafford. It was close to being done, but then Tottenham came back and said they could do it. You have to remember that the Manchester United of 1989 weren’t the Manchester United of four or five years later. \nDoes it annoy you a bit that your two goals against Arsenal at Wembley in 1991 seem to be largely forgotten, with everybody still going on about Gazza’s free-kick?\nBen King, via email\nNot at all – Gazza’s free-kick was unbelievable! [laughs] We all still remember that game and I’m sure all the Spurs fans do, too, as one of their fondest memories. My goals weren’t often memorable, but there were a few of them, so it’s all right.\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyyWxWxkpEU?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=http%3A//www.fourfourtwo.com&amp;wmode=opaque\">Embedded video for Gary Lineker: I almost joined Manchester United – but then Spurs pulled it off</a>\nIs it true you were suffering from hepatitis during Euro 88? How did this affect you?\nKeith Butler, Darlington\nIt was certainly the main reason I struggled! I went into the tournament feeling a bit weary; I played the first game against Ireland and was nowhere near sharp. In the second game against the Netherlands I felt lethargic again, then after the game I sat down and just couldn’t get up. We only had a couple of days before the third match against the Soviet Union, and in training the day before, I could barely lift my legs. We were already out of the tournament and I know Don Howe and Bobby Robson thought I was just trying to get out of the game – they all but said as much. I played against the Soviet Union and came off after about an hour. I’d never played in a game where I was so certain I shouldn’t be on the pitch. I was in a dreadful state. The next morning at the hotel I picked up one of the English papers and saw Bobby Robson having a pop at the players ‘not wanting to play’. I threw the paper at him! I went to hospital as soon as I got back home and ended up staying there for two weeks. I lost a stone-and-a-half. About three days in, Bobby Robson came to visit me and apologise. That was the measure of the man. \nI played against the Soviet Union and came off after about an hour. I’d never played in a game where I was so certain I shouldn’t be on the pitch. I was in a dreadful state\nExpectations for England were pretty low before Italia 90. Why was it that the team defied the odds and did so well?\nDoug, via Twitter\nWe’d played some good stuff going into the tournament, but I suppose expectations were still low because of what happened in ’88. There’s always been this belief that it was player power that led to us changing the system [after the opening game against Ireland] but it was Bobby who came to us  and said that he thought playing three at the back against the Netherlands would suit us. It gave us that little bit more flexibility and made us a little more difficult to play against. In the next game [against Egypt] we went back to 4-4-2 and weren’t that great, so we switched it again for the knockout stage. Bobby was good at taking those big decisions when other managers perhaps wouldn’t.\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdrvZmfyHSg?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=http%3A//www.fourfourtwo.com&amp;wmode=opaque\">Embedded video for Gary Lineker: I almost joined Manchester United – but then Spurs pulled it off</a>\nI really enjoyed playing in the ’90 team. I think it was the best England side since 1966, and results show that\nWhich World Cup did you prefer: ’86 or ’90?\nAmy Foster, Kent \nIt’s hard to say. Mexico 86 changed my life, and I was in better shape – I crushed my toe at Italia 90 and was playing in a lot of pain. That said, I really enjoyed playing in the ’90 team. It was a better team. I think it was the best England side since 1966, and results show that – we were the only England team to reach a World Cup semi-final outside these shores.\nIs it true Blackburn’s Jack Walker wanted to sign you before you left Spurs for Japan? Would Shearer and Lineker have been a better partnership than Shearer and Sutton?\nMatty Cobb, Lancashire\nIt’s true, although my agent actually phoned me and said: “I think this is some kind of publicity stunt.” Obviously, it turned out that Jack Walker actually did have a few bob and was ready to spend it. But I was ready to do something different at that stage. My best days were behind me, so I don’t think any partnership would have really prospered. \nWe're not sure either\nLooking back, do you think going to Japan at 32 was the right thing for your career?\nChris Clark, via Twitter\nI agreed to sign for Nagoya Grampus Eight about a year before I actually moved. During the interim period I had another half-season playing for Spurs, and in that time I injured my foot pretty badly. I struggled from that point. I only played about 15 games in those two years in Japan because of my foot, and it wouldn’t have been much different had I stayed over here. So, in hindsight, it was definitely the right thing to do. \nThese days you see players genuinely fall over and get booked for it, so I imagine I’d suffer from that – I was a little clumsy\nYou famously went your whole career without being booked. Do you think you would have managed that in the modern era?\nLeigh, Devon\nNo, that will never be done again. These days you see players genuinely fall over and get booked for it, so I imagine I’d suffer from that – I was a little clumsy. And, limited though my tackling was, I would occasionally foul someone. I don’t think I would’ve gotten away with them all. The real miracle was surviving three years in Spain, where I once nearly got booked for laughing at a referee.\nWhy did you chip that penalty against Brazil with the England scoring record at stake?\nAdam Pritchard, via Twitter\nThe same reason I chipped five or six others: you’ve got to vary them, because people monitor how you take penalties. Every other time I’d done it, I’d scored. I had done a bit of research and noticed their keeper always went down early, so I thought it was perfect for a little dink. I used to practise penalties in the week before a match, so I’d been hitting 30 or 40 of them a day on a crappy surface at Bisham Abbey. Then when it came to taking one at Wembley, the surface was lush and I hit it a bit fat. It was very embarrassing. The annoying thing was that the keeper actually did go down early, but my penalty was so pathetic it still went straight to him. Obviously I knew what scoring it would mean, but I didn’t think at that stage that it would be my last chance to equal the record.\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2-Nkc8-Kig?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=http%3A//www.fourfourtwo.com&amp;wmode=opaque\">Embedded video for Gary Lineker: I almost joined Manchester United – but then Spurs pulled it off</a>\nHow long did it take you to forgive Graham Taylor for substituting you against Sweden at Euro 92? Assuming you ever have…\nDiana Cooper, via email\nI never really held it against him. He probably did me a favour by making me a martyr. We were a pretty crappy team, probably England’s worst of recent times. We were poor in that game and weren’t creating chances; if he’d left me on I’d have been pilloried with the rest of them after the tournament. Instead, because he took me off, it was turned against him instead. \nDid it piss you off that Rory McGrath was clearly cheating on They Think It’s All Over?\nAlex, Chichester\nNo, of course not – I was his team captain! Not that he was cheating, of course. It was just that the autocue girl was very friendly with him. [Lineker chuckles; FFT moves swiftly on]\nIt may be difficult to be both pundit and coach forever, because it sets you up for some difficult decisions\nHas Gary Neville raised the bar for football punditry? Which other current pundits do you rate?\nCalvin, via Twitter\nGary is obviously one of the best, but Alan Shearer is improving a lot. Since he decided he wasn’t going to be a manager, he’s been really throwing himself into it. Back when he thought he might go into management, I think he felt he needed to be a little bit careful about what he was saying and about who.\nGary might find himself in a similar situation; it may be difficult to be both pundit and coach forever, because it sets you up for some difficult decisions.

Nowadays, you don’t have to be a massive name to make it – guys like Kevin Kilbane and Robbie Savage have shown that.

Gary Lineker in the Land of the Rising Sun\n06/28/2016\nGary Lineker in the Land of the Rising Sun\nON MAY 2, 1992, Gary Winston Lineker scored his final goal in English football as Tottenham Hotspur lost 3-1 to Manchester United. Following the game, players, managers and fans across the UK began to pay tribute to a man who had spent the last ten years terrorizing defences in both Spain and England; a man one goal shy of equalling Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring record for England; a man who had never received a booking in his entire career. For a decade, Lineker had been an English icon and now he was leaving the British Isles for pastures new.\nHe had one last adventure left, this time in Japan, the Land of the Rising Sun.\nLineker was going to receive a lucrative deal from a team called Nagoya Grampus Eight. Based in Nagoya, Grampus Eight seemed a bizarre move for a man still regarded as one of the greatest footballers in England at that time. After all, Lineker was the second highest goalscorer in England during his final season at Spurs, just one goal short of Arsenal’s Ian Wright. The incredulity of the English press led to some very derisive and downright insulting reports. One reporter took particular glee, noting:\n“Lineker … appears happy earning a huge paycheck and content with his decision to retire from competition in Europe to play in third-rate stadiums in a league that is, as he puts it, ‘in its infancy’.”\nSo how did Gary Lineker end up in Japan, playing in ‘third rate stadiums’?\nAlthough it would be naive to think that Lineker wasn’t motivated by money, the former Spurs man was forthright in his answer that money and a desire for something new motivated his decision. Nowadays it’s the norm – evidence by Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard moving to Major League Soccer – but the press took a strange exception to Lineker’s deal. He had even turned down a move to Jack Walker’s Blackburn Rovers . Instead, Lineker continued the time honoured tradition many former stars seem to fall into of plying their trade in a foreign land during the twilight of their careers.\nThe former Barcelona star’s move to Grampus Eight was supposed to be a signal of intent to the rest of the world that Japanese football had finally arrived. For decades football in Japan was a semi-professional pursuit, resigned to the fringes of society and enjoyed by only small pockets of the population.\nIn 1993, the year Lineker moved to Japan, fans would finally see a professional football league, named the J-League, emerge in the Land of the Rising Sun. What’s more, Lineker would be its poster boy. He would be the highest paid player in the J-League. He would be an ambassador for football in the country, akin to Pelé’s time with the New York Cosmos .\nIt was supposed to be a match made in heaven, but unfortunately things began to unravel very quickly for Gary Lineker in Japan.\n \nI. A Strange Beginning\n \nAlthough many people presumed the striker to be a household name the world over, Lineker still found himself explaining to his new team-mates who he was when he touched down in Japan in the summer of 1993. The English and foreign press took strange delight in watching Lineker answer a local news reporter’s question: “Was it Gay-ree Rineka or Gah-ree Rineka?”\nClearly a bedding in period was needed.\nTo paraphrase Ian Rush , ‘living in Japan was like living in a foreign country’ – and despite the fact that Lineker and his wife had spent six months studying Japanese in London prior to their move, the couple struggled to fit in. Upon arriving in Japan Lineker revealed to reporters that, “Trying to find the house in a taxi is a complete nightmare because I don’t even know where I’m going.”\nLuckily Lineker could rely on Grampus coach, Ryuzo Hiraki, and his teammates. Those around the striker did their best to make the star signing feel at home, often speaking to Lineker in his native English. And why wouldn’t they? Lineker would be there for two years and everyone was waiting for the ‘Lineker Effect’ to kick in, most of all, Grampus’s sponsors Toyota.\nThe car firm, based in Nagoya, had heavily subsidised Lineker’s transfer and were keen to get value for their investment. Throwing subtlety out the window, Takayuki Miyashita, a Toyota marketing executive, proudly told the foreign press at Lineker’s first press conference that, “His image as ‘the gentle sportsman’ is a good mix of software and hardware. We want to use him generally for Toyota’s corporate image.”\n‘Use’ being the operative word.\nBy the time the star landed in Nagoya, Toyota had created a Lineker logo and begun featuring the soccer star in full-page newspaper ads, one of which showed him in a tracksuit under the headline ‘Expectation’. A television campaign began in May of that year publicising Lineker’s arrival to coincide with a flooding of Japanese stores of Lineker ‘character goods’, including T-shirts, bath towels and badges.\nBefore even kicking a ball for Grampus Eight, Lineker was a household name, with his face plastered throughout the country on every conceivable piece of merchandise. Lineker’s move also helped to raise Grampus’s reputation abroad, with the Nagoya club briefly becoming the talk of the footballing world. Oddly enough, some of us will remember local kickabouts in the park featuring Manchester United or Liverpool taking on Nagoya Grampus Eight.\n \nII. The Lineker Effect Hits the Field\n \nWhen the football finally began, things looked promising. In his first pre-season match, Lineker gave a solid performance as Grampus beat Shimizu S-Pulse 2-1. He had linked well with his teammates, looking a cut above the rest in terms of fitness and class, and was committed to the cause. Although the Englishman failed to find the net, fans and players were optimistic. Coach Hiraki boasted in the post match interview: “The Lineker effect on the other players is really something.” Hiraki was right to be hopeful, as Lineker repaid the faith shown in him by opening his goal-scoring account with the club soon after.\nSadly though, the Lineker effect soon began to wane.\nIn June 1993, Lineker was ruled out for three months thanks to a broken right toe sustained during a game against Osaka Gambas. The striker had injured his toe in December 1992 and it had failed to heal correctly. He would spend the next three months relegated to the sidelines, watching his teammates flounder in the new Japanese top flight.\nWhen he returned in September he helped Grampus Eight beat Sanfrecce Hiroshima, a win that lifted them from the bottom of the ten man league. Before the Lineker effect could take off, the striker broke another toe – an injury that led Lineker to question whether or not he should just retire there and then. He decided – like the professional he had always been throughout his career – to continue on and honour the second year of his contract, much to the delight of his teammates.\n \nIII. Settling Scores\n \nJapan was also a time of settling scores for Lineker. Despite his sterling reputation on the pitch, during his time in the Far East Lineker revealed his more outspoken side with the release of his controversial autobiography, Strikingly Different, published in 1993. Few had expected any real controversy from the book.\nConsumers and the world of football were in for a shock as Lineker used the book as a opportunity to attack then-England manager Graham Taylor. The previous summer, at the 1992 European Championships, Taylor had taken the decision to substitute Lineker during England’s 2-1 defeat to Sweden in the group stages; a decision widely derided by fans and pundits at the time. Lineker criticized Taylor heavily in his account of the tournament, accusing the manager of allowing personal feelings to affect his judgement.\nLineker was also critical of the decision not to start him for a February 1992 friendly against France, again citing personal differences between the two. Why did Lineker care so much? The Leicester-born hit man crucially finished one goal shy of Bobby Charlton’s record of 49. Taylor’s decisions – claimed by the divisive England manager to be tactical – were seen by Lineker as denying him the chance to become England’s greatest goalscorer.\nIndeed, in a 2012 interview, Taylor admitted he was seen by many, including Lineker, as the man that “stopped him equalling or beating Bobby Charlton”.\nAlthough controversial at the time, the book arguably helped to kickstart Lineker’s media career; it showed, despite his clean cut image on the field, that he was an opinionated footballer off it. That was all for the future, though, as he had promised one more season to Grampus Eight, with many hoping that the second season would see a drastic improvement.\n \nIV. An End Too Soon\n \nLineker’s first season in Japan had boasted one goal in seven appearances, but with news he would be fully fit for the start of the second season, Grampus’s fans were anticipating something great. Once again, things just didn’t click into gear. Lineker promised much with his undoubted talent during the initial stages of his second season but struggled once more, with injury relegating him to the sidelines for the majority of the season. In the end he managed 11 appearances, with three goals. For a season of 30 plus games, it highlighted how much injuries had taken their toll.\nAlthough he was widely respected in Japan, few could argue that the Lineker experiment hadn’t worked out as planned for both the club and the player. When the striker announced his decision to retire from the game in September 1994, there was little surprise; it was time for the England legend to move on.\nWithin two months of his retirement, Lineker had been signed up by The Observer as a columnist and soon after he joined the BBC’s Match of the Day. From Japan to the BBC Match of the Day couch, Lineker retired a legend of a player and a respected TV personality.\nBy Conor Heffernan. Follow @PhysCstudy\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nGary Lineker. Full Name: Gary Winston ... all time came when Gary Lineker decided to move to Japan to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight. ... Tottenham Hotspur: 105: 67 ... Gary Lineker – TalkFootball Gary Lineker – TalkFootball\nOff the pitch…\nLike him or love him, there are few people who would say they don’t have a soft spot for Gary Linekar. He is not only a football legend but a national English treasure and the face of football on the BBC. Lineker was a predator in the six yard box. He seemed to know exactly where to position himself so the ball would arrive at him and he’d grab a quick goal. Not the most flamboyant of players but certainly one of the most deadly in terms of scoring goals. He is England’s second highest scoring goal scorer of all time. And who’d have thought it from a TV presenter!\nMaking Leicester famous for more than just crisps…\nGary Winston Lineker always loved sport. He grew up in Leicester in the very middle of the middle of England. His father was a greengrocer and the trade had been with the Linekers for over 70 years. Linker had his heart set on sport though and was more than accomplished at most he played. An old school report famously said about Lineker that “He must devote less time to his sport if he is to be a success”.\nGary was spotted playing football by local team Leicester City when playing at 13 and he was invited to play for their youth team. When he was 16 Gary started playing full-time. At 18 he started playing for the first team and within a couple of professional years he was already starting to make a prolific name for himself, finishing each season with enough goals to place him up there with the other leading goal scorers in the then Division One. In 1984/85 season Gary finished as top goal-scorer with 24 and this prompted attention from the England international team.\nFerry across to the Mersey\nGary moved to Everton in 1985 and didn’t stop scoring for them either. He bagged a staggering 38 goals in only 52 games for The Toffees and finished top goal scorer again. During this period though it was when the rest of Europe started to become very tempted by such a deadly match-winner as Lineker and the skinny lad from Leicester soon fell onto the radar of the big boys from Spain.\nBig-ears goes to big club\nBarcelona called and Gary answered and in 1986 Lineker moved to Spanish giants Barcelona. In the same year Gary played in the Mexican World Cup and won the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals in the competition. The Spaniards were rubbing their hands at the prospect of a repeat performance at the Nou Camp.\nGary did it again and he netted 21 goals for Barca in only 41 games, including a hat-trick against arch rivals Real Madrid, which led him to cult status amongst the fans. He was becoming prolific and an absolute nightmare to defend against. With Lineker up-front Barcelona went on to win the UEFA Cup and the Copa del Rev but a fall out with Dutch legend Johan Cruiff, when he was suddenly moved out of position to the right-wing, spelt time at the Barca for golden-boot-Gary.\nTottenham Hot-stuff\nLineker passed on Manchester United’s generous offers and decided his return to English football would be with north London’s Tottenham Hotspur. It was here that Gary entered the peak of his form. From 105 games Gary scored in over half of them with a whopping 67 goals. He helped them win the FA Cup and, playing alongside Paul Gascoigne for most of it, he made Spurs a force to be reckoned with. Gary was voted third in the first ever FIFA World Player of the Year awards in 1991.\nThe Setting Sun of Japan\nOne of the most unexpected transfer moves of all time came when Gary Lineker decided to move to Japan to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight. No one in Europe seemed to even know Japan had a football league, let alone feel they deserved such a legend as Lineker. But Gary felt his struggling injuries and weariness of the European game meant a growing football nation would suit him perfectly and also hugely benefit the country’s desire to improve their football profile. He was loved in Japan and, although he only played 23 games in the two seasons he was there, he still couldn’t resist scoring 9 more goals to add to his huge tally.\nGary finished his club football career having never received a yellow or red card. He was the ultimate sportsman and the ultimate gentleman. He was one of the greatest examples of an England player we have ever seen and his goals for his country were some of the most crucial in history.\nPlayer Statistics\nFifa World Cup – Golden Shoe: 1986 (Mexico)\nEnglish League Top Scorer: 1985, 1986, 1990\nWe’re singing for England….\nIt began in 1984 against Scotland. It ended with 80 appearances and a staggering (but expected from Gary) 48 goals. None were more vital than in the Mexico World Cup finals when Gary helped England to qualify for the knock-out stages by scoring an incredible hat-trick against Poland. Then against Paraguay he struck twice again to send them into the quarter finals to face Argentina. But sadly Lineker’s one goal was no match for another legend called Maradona’s two. England went out but would be back in 1990 for more drama.\nItalia 90 will go down in history as being one of the most dramatic moments in football for all teams involved but particularly for England. Lineker scored one of only two England goals in the group stages but then made up for it when they got to the quarter finals having beaten Belgium in the round before. His two penalties against Cameroon in the quarter-finals meant England would face their arch-rivals West Germany in the semis. It would go down as one of the most famous games of football ever. Gazza’s tears, Lineker’s 80th minute equaliser and that penalty shoot-out. Which England of course lost.\nAfter this came a somewhat sad end to his England career when, in the Euro 92 tournament, new coach Graham Taylor subbed Lineker and prevented him from trying to beat Bobby Charton’s top goal scoring record. He was upset and didn’t play for England again.\nOff the pitch…\nAt times you’d be forgiven for even remembering that Lineker was even a footballer. He is such an icon of British sport on television now that it seems he’s always been doing it. Coming on as sub in the early nineties for Des Lynam but eventually being promoted to the first team, Linker was to be the new face of the institutional Match of the Day programme. He also rose up the ranks in TV when he was a regular captain on the sports game-show They Think It’s All Over, which often revealed a more humane and jovial side to him. Gary still presents Match of the Day today, as well as the BBCs coverage of The Masters and various other occasional programmes.\nAside from sport, Gary is also well know for his appearance in the Leicester-based company Walkers Crisps adverts. Which have used his squeaky clean image and reversed it to show how irresistible they are. Here is one when Gary came back from Japan.\nIn his personal life Gary married his child-hood sweet heart Michelle and they had four sons together. His oldest boy George was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was only a baby but he has since made a full recovery. He divorced from Michelle in 2007 but they remain amiable.\nLineker continues to present sport on the BBC as well as voicing narration for children’s programme Underground Ernie and appearing as himself in the odd film too. He will always be a national treasure for the English. A man we all wish we knew; he feels like one of us. A great footballer and a great ambassador for the game of football and for sport in general.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nMy Questions. by jtr38374. on Apr 07, 2015. Report Category: Documents.
