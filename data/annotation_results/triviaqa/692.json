When Helfgott travels to London on a musical scholarship, his career as a pianist blossoms.

Nonetheless, it's a very well-made movie.\nGeoffrey Rush is fascinating in the lead role as \"David Helfgott.\" However, I would give equal kudos to Noah Taylor, who played Helfgott as a teenager, and to Armin Mueller-Stahl, who was Helfgott's father. They were just as impressive as Rush.\nThis is a supposedly true-life story of child prodigy piano player from Australia. As you can imagine, the music in here is excellent. Even better is the cinematography. Wow, this looks and sounds fantastic on DVD.\nAlthough not always pleasant to watch, the story is riveting; hard to put down once you've started watching. The ending turned me off a bit with the overt plug for astrology, but is a happy one for all parties and at least leaves the viewer feeling satisfied.\nIn all, a very intense, beautifully-photographed biography.\n24 of 30 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nGeoffrey Rush stars as a messed up but brilliant musician, ... he became one of nineteen actors who has won a Tony, an Oscar and an Emmy. ... Geoffrey Rush in SHINE. Geoffrey Rush – MovieActors.com Geoffrey Rush – MovieActors.com\nGeoffrey Rush: Best Actor 1996: MovieActors.com\nSHINE (Drama – R)\nGeoffrey Rush stars as a messed up but brilliant musician, coping with personal and professional trials and triumphs.\nAbout Geoffrey Rush\nGeoffrey Rush was born on July 6th, 1951, in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia. When his parents divorced, he moved to Brisbane, Austrialia and grew up there. He graduated from University of Queensland with a degree in the Arts.\nThis  Australian actor, Geoffrey Rush spent many years on the theatrical stage in Australia, as an actor and director. His durable presence in the both the Queensland Company and the State Theatre Company of South Australia  showed his talent and versatality as a thespian in a variety of stage plays that ranged from classical to modern.\nGeoffrey Rush married the love of his life, actress Jane Menelaus in 1988.  They have two children, Angelica (1992), and James (1995).\nGeoffrey Rush's first major film role was playing the character, Andrew Aguecheek, in the 1987 film, TWELFTH NIGHT.  However, it wasn't until his performance in the 1996 film, CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION that Rush was noticed by film producers and Rush's film career began to take off finally. Doors began to open for him.\nFinally, he was  cast in the 1996 movie, SHINE, where he brilliantly portrays  a struggling Australian concert pianist, dealing with abuse in his childhood, as well as the legacy of the loss of many family members in Hitler's persecution of Jews in World War II. The character, based on a real pianist,  suffers a nervous breakdown, is institutionalized and many years later, makes a comeback, first in clubs and then as a concert pianist. Rush received an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.\nInterestingly, Geoffrey Rush did almost all of his own piano playing in SHINE, as he is an accomplished pianist in his own right.\nTwo years later, in 1998, he played a ruthless, diabolical diplomat in ELIZABETH, with Cate Blanchette. Also in 1998, he played a comic role, as the director of the King's Men, the acting company Shakespeare belonged to in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. His performance was nominated for an Oscar.\nIn 2000, he was cast as the Marquis de Sade in  QUILLS, with Kate Winslet, in a role for which he was again nominated for an Oscar.\nIn 2002, he played Leon Trotsky in FRIDA, with Salma Hayek.\nIn 2003, he played in THE PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL, with Johnny Depp.\nIn 2009, he became one of nineteen actors who has won a Tony, an Oscar and an Emmy.  He won his Tony for his performance in the play, EXIT THE KING, to go with his 1997 Oscar for SHINE, and his 2004 EMMY for THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PETER SELLERS.\nIn 2011, Geoffrey Rush was again honored with a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination   for his performance in the 2010 film, THE KING'S SPEECH. In this true story,  Geoffrey portrayed speech therapist, Lionel Logue, who helped King George VI (played by Colin Firth) get around his stammer, and rise to the occasions where the King had to address his people in speeches during World War 11.\nGeoffrey also was nominated for a Golden Globe, and won a BAFTA Award and a British Independent Film Award for this same wonderful performance.\nGeoffrey Rush's notable movie credits include...\nDAD AND DAVE: ON OUR SELECTION (1995)\nCALL ME SAL (1996)\nA LITTLE BIT OF SOUL (1998)\nLES MISERABLES (1998)\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nDoes Richard Wagner Look Like Geoffrey Rush? ...

Let's take Richard Wagner , for example. This musical genius composed magnificent music that has been appreciated by generations because of its buildup of tension and complexity, such as \"Ride of the Valkyries\" and \"Tristan und Isolde.\" However, Wagner was a pretty cold-hearted guy. He was openly anti-semitic and one of his biggest supporters was Adolf Hitler . So yeah, Wagner would get an A for his art and influence in music, but an F for being on the right side of history. Although Wagner's lookalike, Geoffrey Rush , isn't a musician, he played concert pianist David Helfgott in the film Shine, for which he won an Oscar. The real-life Helfgott is known for playing a variety of classical music, including music from the Romantic era. And guess who was a famous composer of the Romantic Era? That's right, our favorite musical (albeit misguided) genius, Wagner. It all comes full circle, people.\nWhich figures in history share a striking resemblence?

Geoffrey Rush came out nowhere from down under to take the Oscar....by force! The force of his incredible performance as David Helfgott, child prodigy, mental patient and a damaged young man saved by his talent and love for music. Also memorable is Noah Taylor as young David, Armin Muehller Stall as the sonofabitch dad and the late Lynn Redgrave as David's wife. The moments of brilliance are many. The attempt to tackle Rachmaninoff, David walking out of the street into a piano-bar, wet cigarrette hanging from his lip then starts playing like the brilliant pianist that he is and that final concert. The standing ovation and getting his due late in life is a tearjerker. Love this movie.\nReview by Varghese Eapen ★★★★\n>There is something about the usage of western classical music in movies which makes me very happy. It can depict a scene in an altogther different manner whether it is a joyous or sad occasion. Piano especially is the most powerful tool on display here.\n> Geoffrey Rush gives a virtuoso performance,it takes a while to undestand since he speaks so fast (hehe) His dedication to the role is marvellous. i rate this along with Quills as the best works in his career.\n> I seriously felt like punching the father in the manner in which he treated David. No biopic is hundred percent accurate and according to stories from his family he was never cruel to son as shown in the movie.\n> I noticed a strange resemblance to the superior A Beautiful Mind in certain scenes.\n>Kudos on the remarkable DVD Cover!\nReview by Kevin ★★★★½\nEven if you don't fancy the subject (man in prime of life, blessed with an extraordinary musical gift has a nervous breakdown and is lost to the world of classical music) you still should still watch Shine just for the Oscar winning performance of Geoffrey Rush. He is Un 'bloody' believable.\n3\nLove, mental illness and great musical talent that couldn't be realised due to the mental illness, even with the love that helped rescue the sufferer. This is the story of David Helfgott, a talented pianist who went through severe mental breakdown (in real life). It is an extraordinary tale of love, and the damage that can be caused by mental illness.\nReview by TJ D ★★★½\nShine is an interestingly constructed film, not including Geoffrey Rush's Oscar-winning performance in full until about half-way through the film. The film here is a biopic about a mentally sick pianist, and it plays like an indie version of that tale. What elevates this past the slog is certainly Rush and the actor playing his at-times cruel but conflicted father, Armin Mueller-Stahl. That central relationship between father and son is what carries this film in terms of drama, and it works surprisingly well.\nSee it for these two actors, who give very different performances. Rush is performative, showing the tics and charm combination of his character, while Mueller-Stahl is refined and inward, showing his anger in brief glimpses.\nOne of my favorite music movies.\nIncredible performance by Geoffrey Rush.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\n...
