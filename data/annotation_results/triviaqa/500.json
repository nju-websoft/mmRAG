Since all the 107 Laureates selected from 1901   to 2000 are to be mentioned, the emphasis will be on facts and   names. At the same time, however, I shall try to deal with two   central questions about the Nobel Peace Prize. First, why does   the Peace Prize have the prestige it actually has? Second, what   explains the nature of the historical record the Norwegian Nobel  Committee has established over these 100 years?\nThere are more than 300 peace prizes in the   world. None is in any way as well known and as highly respected   as the Nobel Peace Prize. The Oxford Dictionary of Twentieth   Century World History, to cite just one example, states that   the Nobel Peace Prize is \"The world's most prestigious prize   awarded for the 'preservation of peace'.\" Personally, I think   there are many reasons for this prestige: the long history of the   Peace Prize; the fact that it belongs to a family of prizes, i.e.   the Nobel family, where all the family members benefit from the   relationship; the growing political independence of the Norwegian   Nobel Committee; the monetary value of the prize, particularly in   the early and in the most recent years of its history. In this   context, however, I am going to concentrate on the historical   record of the Nobel Peace Prize. In my opinion, the prize would   never have enjoyed the kind of position it has today had it not   been for the decent, even highly respectable, record the   Norwegian Nobel Committee has established in its selections over   these 100 years. One important element of this record has been   the committee's broad definition of peace, enough to take in   virtually any relevant field of peace work.\nOn the second point, the selections of the   Norwegian Nobel Committee reflected the insights primarily of the   committee members and secondarily of its secretaries and   advisors.\nBut, on a deeper level, they also generally reflected Norwegian   definitions of the broader, Western values of an idealist, the   often slightly left-of-center kind, but rarely so far left that   the choices were not acceptable to Western   liberal-internationalist opinion in general. The Norwegian   government did not determine the choices of the Norwegian Nobel   Committee, but these choices reflected the same mixture of   idealism and realism that characterized Norwegian, and   Scandinavian, foreign policy in general. As we shall see, some of   the most controversial choices occurred when the Norwegian Nobel   Committee suddenly awarded prizes to rather hard-line realist   politicians.\nNobel's Will and the Peace Prize\nWhen Alfred Nobel died on December 10,   1896, it was discovered that he had left a will, dated November   27, 1895, according to which most of his vast wealth was to be   used for five prizes, including one for peace. The prize for   peace was to be awarded to the person who \"shall have done the   most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the   abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding of   peace congresses.\" The prize was to be awarded \"by a committee of  five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting.\"\nNobel left no explanation as to why the   prize for peace was to be awarded by a Norwegian committee while   the other four prizes were to be handled by Swedish committees.   On this point, therefore, we are dealing only with educated   inferences. These are some of the most likely ones: Nobel, who   lived most of his life abroad and who wrote his will at the   Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris, may have been influenced by the   fact that, until 1905, Norway was in union with Sweden. Since the   scientific prizes were to be awarded by the most competent, i.e.   Swedish, committees at least the remaining prize for peace ought   to be awarded by a Norwegian committee. Nobel may have been aware   of the strong interest of the Norwegian Storting (Parliament) in   the peaceful solution of international disputes in the 1890s. He   might have in fact, considered Norway a more peace-oriented and   more democratic country than Sweden. Finally, Nobel may have been   influenced by his admiration for Norwegian fiction, particularly   by the author Bjørnstjerne   Bjørnson , who was a well-known peace activist in the   1890s. Or it may have been a combination of all these   factors.\nWhile there was a great deal of controversy   surrounding Nobel's will in Sweden and that of the role of the   designated prize-awarding institutions, certainly including the   fact that the rebellious Norwegians were to award the Peace   Prize, the Norwegian Storting quickly accepted its role as   awarder of the Nobel Peace Prize. On April 26, 1897, a month   after it had received formal notification from the executors of   the will, the Storting voted to accept the responsibility, more   than a year before the designated Swedish bodies took similar   action. It was to take three years of various legal actions   before the first Nobel Prizes could actually be   awarded.\n1901-1913: The Peace Prize to the Organized   Peace Movement\nAlthough there was nothing in the statutes   that prevented the Storting from naming international members,   the members of the Nobel Committee of the Storting (as the   committee was called until 1977) have all been Norwegians from   the very beginning. They were selected by the Storting to reflect   the strengths of the various parties, but the members elected   their own chairman. From December 1901 and until his death in   1922, Jørgen Løvland was the chairman of the Nobel   Committee. He was one of the leaders of the Venstre (Left) party   and served briefly as Foreign Minister (1905-1907), and then as   Prime Minister (1907-1908). A majority of the five committee  members in this period consistently represented that party.\nInitially, Venstre represented a broad   democratic-nationalist coalition, emphasizing universal suffrage,   first for men, later for women, and independence from Sweden. The   party strongly wanted to isolate Norway from Great Power   politics; not only did it want Norway's full independence, but   also some form of guaranteed permanent neutrality, based on the   Swiss model. Yet at the same time, the party had a definite   interest in international peace work in the form of mediation,   arbitration and the peaceful solution of disputes. Small   countries, certainly including Norway, were to show the world the   way from Great Power politics to a world based on law and   norms.\nNorwegian parliamentarians, particularly   from Venstre, took a strong interest in the Inter-Parliamentary   Union formed in 1889. After Switzerland, Norway was the first   country to pledge an annual contribution, first for its general   operations (1895), and then for its office in Bern (1897). Norway   was to have hosted the Union's conference in 1893, but because of   the tense situation vis-à-vis Sweden the conference in Oslo   was held only in 1899. These same liberal politicians were also   highly sympathetic to the peace groups and societies that sprang   up in many countries in the last decades of the 1800s, groups   which starting in 1889 were internationally organized in the more   or less annual Universal Peace Congress. The Permanent   International Peace Bureau, founded in 1891 in Bern, became the   international headquarters of this popular movement. (The   movement long struggled with difficult finances, despite small   fixed annual grants from Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and   Norway.) A third element in the peace work of this period was the   more official movement, culminating in the Hague Conferences of   1899 and 1907, called by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, to the   enormous surprise of the governments of most other major powers.   (The tsar was never seriously considered for the Peace   Prize.)\nThose few members of the Nobel Committee   who did not represent Venstre tended to be jurists who took a   special interest in building peace through international law, a   desire shared by Venstre. Thus, former conservative Prime   Minister and law professor Francis Hagerup was a committee member   from 1907 to 1920. He was also chairman of the Norwegian   delegation to the second Hague Conference in 1907.\nWith this composition of the Nobel   Committee in mind, the list of the Nobel Laureates for the years   1901 to 1914 comes as no big surprise. Of the 19 prizes awarded   during this period, only two went to persons who did not   represent the Inter-Parliamentary Union, popular peace groups or   the international legal tradition. The first two elements may   also be said to have reflected the point in Nobel's will about   the prize being awarded for \"the holding and promotion of peace   congresses.\"\nThe first prize in 1901 was awarded to Frédéric   Passy (and Jean   Henry Dunant ). Passy was an obvious choice for the first   prize since he had been one of the main founders of the   Inter-Parliamentary Union and also the main organizer of the   first Universal Peace Congress. He was himself the leader of the   French peace movement. In his own person, he thus brought   together the two branches of the international organized peace   movement, the parliamentary one and the broader peace   societies.\nIn 1902, the Peace Prize was awarded to Élie   Ducommun , veteran peace advocate and the first honorary   secretary of the International Peace Bureau, and to Charles Albert Gobat ,   first Secretary General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and who   later became Secretary General of the International Peace Bureau.   (In 1906-1908 Gobat coordinated both groups, further underlining   the close relationship between them.) In 1903 the prize went to William   Randal Cremer , the \"first father\" of the Inter-Parliamentary   Union. In 1889, Bertha   von Suttner had published her anti-war novel Lay Down Your   Arms. After that, she was drawn into the international peace   movement. She undoubtedly exercised considerable influence on   Alfred Nobel, whom she had known since 1876, when he later   decided to include the Peace Prize as one of the five prizes   mentioned in his will. In 1905, she was awarded the Peace Prize,   the first woman to receive such a distinction. Her supporters   strongly felt that the prize had come too late, since she had had   such an influence on Nobel. In 1907, the prize was awarded to Ernesto       Teodoro Moneta , a key leader of the Italian peace movement.       In 1908, the prize was divided between Fredrik       Bajer , the foremost peace advocate in Scandinavia, combining       work in the Inter-Parliamentary Union with being the first president       of the International Peace Bureau, and Klas       Pontus Arnoldson , founder of the Swedish Peace and Arbitration       League. In 1910, the Permanent       International Peace Bureau itself received the prize. In       1911, Alfred       Hermann Fried , founder of the German Peace Society, leading       peace publisher/educator and a close collaborator, shared it       with Tobias       Michael Carel Asser . In 1913, Henri       La Fontaine was the first socialist to receive the Nobel       Peace Prize. He was head of the International Peace Bureau from       1907 until his death in 1943. He was also active in the Inter-Parliamentary       Union.\nInternational legal work for peace represented     the third road to the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1904, the Institute     of International Law , the first organization or institution     to receive the Peace Prize, was honored for its efforts as an     unofficial body to formulate the general principles of the science     of international law. In 1907, Louis     Renault , leading French international jurist and a member     of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, shared the     Peace Prize with Ernesto     Teodoro Moneta . In 1909, the prize was shared between Paul     Henri Benjamin Balluet, Baron d’Estournelles de Constant     de Rebecque , who combined diplomatic work for Franco-German     and Franco-British understanding with a distinguished career in     international arbitration, and Auguste     Marie François Beernaert , former Belgian Prime Minister,     representative to the two Hague conferences, and a leading figure     in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Like d'Estournelles and Renault,     Beernaert was also a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.     Thus, few if any of the Laureates summed up the different stands     of the early peace movement in the way Beernaert did. The Laureate     of 1911, Tobias Michael Carel Asser, was also a member of the     Court of Arbitration as well as the initiator of the Conferences     on International Private Law. When America's Elihu     Root received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1912, he had served     both as U.S. Secretary of War and Secretary of State. But he was     awarded the prize primarily for his strong interest in international     arbitration and for his plan for a world court, which was finally     established in 1920.\nJean Henry Dunant (1901) and Theodore       Roosevelt (1906) are the two Laureates who clearly fall       outside any of the categories mentioned so far. Dunant, who       founded the International       Red Cross in 1863, had been more or less forgotten until       a campaign secured him several international prizes, including       the first Nobel Peace Prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee thus       established a broad definition of peace, arguing that even humanitarian       work embodied \"the fraternity between nations\" that Nobel had       referred to in his will. Roosevelt was the twenty-sixth president       of the United States and the first in a long series of statesmen       to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He received the prize for       his successful mediation to end the Russo-Japanese war and for       his interest in arbitration, having provided the Hague arbitration       court with its very first case. Internationally, however, he       was best known for a rather bellicose posture, which certainly       included the use of force. It is known that both the secretary       and the relevant adviser of the Nobel Committee at that time       were highly critical of an award to Roosevelt. It is thus tempting       to speculate that the American president was honored at least       in part because Norway, as a new state on the international       arena, \"needed a large, friendly neighbor - even if he is far       away,\" as one Norwegian newspaper put it. Even if, or perhaps       rather because, the prize to Roosevelt was controversial, it       did in some ways constitute a breakthrough in international       media interest in the Nobel Peace Prize.\n1914-1918: The First World War and the     Red Cross\nThe First World War signified the collapse     of the peaceful world which so many of the peace activists honored     by the Nobel Peace Prize had worked so hard to establish. During     the war, the number of nominations for the prize diminished somewhat,     although a substantial number was still put forward. During the     difficult war years, the Nobel Committee in neutral Norway decided     to award no prize, except the one in 1917 to the International     Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The ICRC had been established     in 1863 as a Swiss committee; the preceding year, the Convention     for the Amelioration of the Conditions of the Wounded in Armies     in the Field (the Geneva Convention) had been signed. During the     First World War, the ICRC undertook the tremendous task of trying     to protect the rights of the many prisoners of war on all sides,    including their right to establish contacts with their families.\n1919-1939: The League of Nations and     the Work for Peace\nIn the 1920s, Venstre's domination of the     Nobel Committee continued even after the death of Jørgen     Løvland and despite the choice of Conservative law professor     Fredrik Stang (1922-1941) as the new chairman of the committee     and the inclusion of Labor party historian Halvdan Koht in 1919.     Old-timers Hans Jakob Horst and Bernhard Hanssen served on the     committee from 1901 to 1931 and from 1913 to 1939, respectively.     They were joined by Johan Ludwig Mowinckel (1925-1936) who meanwhile     served as both Norway's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister during     three separate periods. In the 1930s, the membership of the committee     became more mixed, but the Venstre members now maintained the     balance between more conservative and social democratic members.     Still, during the period from 1919 to 1939, the growing political     tension within the committee and the presence of certain stubborn     individuals, resulted in as many as nine \"irregular\" years, when     either no prize was awarded or it was awarded one year late, compared    to only one such year in the period from 1901 to 1913.\nAfter the First World War, Norway became a     member of the League of Nations. This break with the past was     smaller than it might seem. In the Storting, 20 members, largely     Social Democrats, voted against membership. Even most of the 100     who voted in favor came to insist on the right to withdraw from     the sanctions regime of the League in case of war. Norway basically     still perceived itself as a neutral state. The old ideals of mediation,     arbitration, and the establishment of international legal norms     definitely survived, only slightly tempered by the experiences     of the war and the membership in the League. Yet at the same time,     some states and some statesmen were definitely regarded as better     than others. Most Norwegian foreign policy leaders felt closest     to Great Britain and the United States, despite significant fishery     disputes with the former and the geographical distance and isolationism     of the latter.\nAt least eight of the 21 Laureates in the     period from 1919 to 1939 had a clear connection with the League     of Nations. For the Nobel Committee the League came to represent     the enhancement of the Inter-Parliamentary Union tradition from     before 1914. In 1919, the Peace Prize was awarded to the President     of the United States, Thomas     Woodrow Wilson for his crucial role in establishing the League.     Wilson had been nominated by many, including Venstre Prime Minister     Gunnar Knudsen. In a certain sense the prize to Wilson was obvious;     what still made it controversial, also among committee members,     was that the League was part of the Versailles Treaty, which was     regarded as diverging from the president's own ideal of \"peace     without victory.\" The prize in 1920 to Léon     Victor Auguste Bourgeois , a prominent French politician and     peace activist, showed the continuity between the pre-1914 peace     movement and the League. Bourgeois had participated in both the     Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907; in 1918-1919 he pushed for     what became the League to such an extent that he was frequently     called its \"spiritual father.\"\nSwedish Social Democratic leader Karl       Hjalmar Branting had also done long service for peace, but       was particularly honored in 1921 with the Peace Prize for his       work in the League of Nations. His fellow Laureate, Norway's Christian       Lous Lange , the first secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee,       had been the secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union       since 1909 and had done important work in keeping the Union       alive even during the war. After the war he was active in the       League until his death in 1938. In 1922, the Norwegian Nobel       Committee honored another Norwegian, Fridtjof       Nansen , for his humanitarian work in Russia, which was done       outside the League, but even more importantly for his work on       behalf of the League to repatriate a great number of prisoners       of war. From 1921, he was the League's High Commissioner for       Refugees. The refugee problem proved rather intractable. The Nansen       International Office for Refugees was authorized by the       League in 1930 and was closed only in 1938. For its work, it       received that year's Nobel Peace Prize.\nIn 1934, British Labour leader Arthur       Henderson received the Peace Prize for his work for the       League, particularly its efforts in disarmament. No single individual       was more closely identified with the League from its beginning       to its end than Viscount       Cecil of Chelwood who was honored with the prize in 1937.       Only Koht's threat of resignation from the committee prevented       the Peace Prize from being awarded directly to the League of       Nations. In 1924, the committee even discussed awarding the       prize to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.\nIn the years 1919-1939, the Nobel Committee     also continued to honor the less official workers for peace. Since     the peace societies of the pre-1914 period had lost most of their     importance, this category of Laureates was now considerably more     mixed than it had been in the earlier period. The clearest connection     to the past was found in the shared prize for 1927 to Ludwig     Quidde and Ferdinand     Buisson . Buisson had joined his first peace society as early     as 1867 and he had also been active in the Inter-Parliamentary     Union, while the younger Quidde had joined the German Peace Society     in 1892. In 1927, they were honored for their contributions to     Franco-German popular reconciliation. In 1930, Lars     Olof Nathan Söderblom was the first church leader to     be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to involve the     churches not only in work for ecumenical unity, but also for world     peace. In 1931, Jane     Addams was honored for her social reform work, but even more     for establishing in 1919, and then leading the Women's International     League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Sharing the prize with Jane     Addams was Nicholas     Murray Butler , president of the Carnegie Endowment for International     Peace, promoter of the Briand-Kellogg pact and leader of the more     establishment-oriented part of the American peace movement. Sir     Norman Angell , who received the Peace Prize for 1933, had     written his famous book The Great Illusion as early as     1910. In the book he argued that war did not pay, not that it     was impossible as it was frequently understood to have stated.     In the inter-war years, he was a strong supporter of the League     of Nations as well as an influential publicist/educator for peace     in general.\nThe most clear-cut representative in this     period of the legal tradition to limit or even end war was the     former American Secretary of State, Frank     Billings Kellogg . He was awarded the 1929 Peace Prize for     the Kellogg-Briand pact, whose signatories agreed to settle all     conflicts by peaceful means and renounced war as an instrument     of national policy.\nWhile Theodore Roosevelt and, to a lesser     extent, Elihu Root, were the only prominent international politicians     to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in the years before 1914, at     least five prominent politicians in addition to Kellogg were to     be so honored between 1919 and 1939. In 1926 alone, the Nobel     Committee actually awarded the reserved prize for 1925 to Vice     President Charles     Gates Dawes of the United States and Foreign Secretary Sir     Austen Chamberlain of Great Britain and the 1926 prize to     Foreign Minister Aristide     Briand of France and Foreign Minister Gustav     Stresemann of Germany. Dawes was responsible for the Dawes     Plan for German reparations which was seen as having provided     the economic underpinning of the Locarno Pact of 1925, under which     Germany accepted its western borders as final. The four prizes     reflected recognition of the changed international political climate,     particularly between Germany and France, which Locarno helped     bring about. It was probably also an effort by the committee to     strengthen Norway's relations with the four international powers that mattered most for its interests. In 1936, the prize was awarded     to Argentine Foreign Minister Carlos     Saavedra Lamas for his mediation of an end to the Chaco War     between Paraguay and Bolivia. Lamas also played a significant     role in the League of Nations.\nThe most controversial award of the inter-war     period was undoubtedly the one for 1935 to Carl     von Ossietzky , the anti-militarist German journalist held     by the Nazis in a concentration camp who had become an important     international symbol for the struggle against Germany's rearmament.     The prospect of a prize to Ossietzky led to the withdrawal from     the committee of both Koht, at that time Norway's Foreign Minister,     and Mowinckel, who served several times as Prime Minister. This     was done to establish a separation between Norway as a state and     the Norwegian Nobel Committee. At least Koht was also skeptical     of the choice of Ossietzky as a Laureate. This was the first such     withdrawal in the committee's history. The Storting then decided     that no government minister could serve on the committee while     in office. Hitler's reaction to the award was strong. He issued     an order under which no German could receive any of the Nobel     Prizes. (This affected two Chemistry Laureates, Richard     Kuhn in 1938 and Adolf     Friedrich Johann Butenandt in 1939 and Medicine Laureate Gerhard     Domagk in 1939.) Ossietzky was not permitted to go to Oslo     to receive the prize; he was transferred to a private sanatorium,     but died 17 months later. The prize to Ossietzky illustrated how     controversy could be combined with prestige for the prize, although     this became much clearer over time than it was in 1936.\n1940-1945: The Second World War and Another     Prize to the Red Cross\nOn April 9, 1940, Germany attacked Norway     and two months later the entire country was occupied. The Norwegian     government fled to London. Committee meetings were actually held     during the first years of the war, but from 1943 with the committee     members scattered, no further meetings were held. The early meetings     focused on non-prize business. By underlining the Swedish nature     of the Nobel Foundation, the Nobel Committee in Oslo escaped a    German takeover of its Institute building.\nNo Peace Prize had been awarded for 1939 since     the war had broken out well before the prize was normally announced.     Later, during the war virtually no nominations came in. When the     committee was able to meet again after the war, it decided to     give the Peace Prize for 1944 to the International     Committee of the Red Cross , the same Laureate as in 1917,     with much the same reasoning. In the darkest hour the ICRC had \"held     aloft the fundamental conceptions of the solidarity of the human     race.\" In so doing it had promoted the \"fraternity between nations\" which     Nobel had referred to in his will.\n1945-1966: The Cold War and the United     Nations\nIn 1945, Norway joined the United Nations     with considerable enthusiasm. There was little of the division     and hesitancy that had characterized Norway's policy toward the     League of Nations. The German attack on Norway had destroyed most     of the earlier confidence in neutrality; so when the Cold War     began and Norway felt it had to make a choice between East and     West it definitely chose the West, first in the form of the Marshall     Plan and then NATO. Norway became quite a loyal member of NATO,     but remnants of the more traditional attitudes could be found in the policy of no foreign troops and no atomic weapons on Norwegian     soil, in its negative attitude toward European and even Nordic     integration and in a lingering skepticism toward Great Power politics     and arms build-ups. The idealist component in Norwegian foreign     policy now moved away from arbitration and mediation and more     toward arms control and disarmament, aid to poor countries, and,     increasingly, questions of human rights, certainly including those    in Allied countries.\nFrom 1945 to 1965 the Labor party dominated     Norwegian politics. From 1949 to 1965 it also held a majority     on the Nobel Committee, but the three Labor members rarely behaved     as a group, since two were strongly Western-oriented (Martin Tranmæl     and Aase Lionæs) and one was more neutral (Gustav Natvig     Pedersen). The chairman of the committee from 1942, in effect     from 1945 to 1966, Gunnar Jahn, was a stubborn Venstre politician;     the Conservative leader C.J. Hambro was equally stubborn and had     strong links back to the inter-war years. From 1949 to 1964 membership     on the committee remained entirely unchanged. Again, tension within     the committee was one strong factor behind the large number of     years with no prize or postponed prizes (eight) during this period.\nOf the 20 prizes awarded in this period, nine     were in some way or other related to the United Nations, thus     reflecting both the strong Norwegian support for the organization     as such and the continuation of the long committee line going     back to the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the League of Nations.     Long-time U.S. Secretary of State Cordell     Hull was given the 1945 award primarily for his, and America's,     strong leadership in the creation of the UN. In 1949 Lord     John Boyd Orr of Brechin was honored as the founding director-general     of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, the first scientist     to win the Peace Prize, not for his scientific discoveries as     such, but for the way in which they were employed to \"promote     cooperation between nations.\" In 1950 the prize went to Ralph     Bunche , the principal secretary of the UN Palestine Commission,     for his mediation of the 1949 armistice between the warring parties.     Bunche was also the first black person to receive the Nobel Peace     Prize. More loosely connected to the UN, in 1951 veteran French     and international labor leader Léon     Jouhaux was the recipient of the Peace Prize. He had helped     found the International Labor Organization in 1919 and had been     active in the League of Nations. After the war he was a French     delegate to the UN General Assembly. In 1954 the Office     of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , established     in 1951, was honored, thereby underlining the long-standing interest     of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in the question of refugees.\nThe Peace Prize in 1957 to Canada's Lester     Bowles Pearson was given primarily for his role in trying to end     the Suez conflict and to solve the Middle East question through     the United Nations. As Foreign Minister of Canada he had become     one of the leading UN statesmen of his period. In 1961, the prize     was awarded to the second Secretary General of the UN, Dag     Hammarskjöld , for strengthening the organization. Hammarskjöld     is the only person to have received the prize posthumously, a     few months after his death in a plane crash in the Congo; the     Nobel statutes were later changed to make a posthumous prize virtually     impossible. (In 1965 and 1966 a majority of the committee clearly     favored giving the prize to the third Secretary General, U Thant,     and even to the first, Norway's Trygve Lie, but chairman Jahn     more or less vetoed this.) The United     Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) , established by the     UN General Assembly in 1946, was awarded the Peace Prize in 1965.\nMost of the politicians who were given prizes     related to the UN combined their UN work with a clear Western     orientation in the Cold War. This went for Hull, Bunche, Jouhaux,     and Pearson and, to a lesser extent, also Hammarskjöld. In     this period no Communist politician was ever seriously considered     for the prize. (Soviet diplomat and feminist Alexandra Kollontay     was discussed in 1946-1947, but quickly rejected.) A whole series     of Indians - Gandhi and     Nehru, but also other politicians, philosophers and scholars -     were considered, but all were found wanting in one way or another.     Still the committee was reluctant to give the prize to politicians     who were seen as too exclusively Western in their orientation.     The only exception was George     Catlett Marshall , Peace Laureate of 1953. Marshall's name     was of course closely linked with the famous Marshall Plan, but     the Cold War nature of his work was played down by the committee     in favor of his role during the Second World War and his humanitarian     work in general.\nDuring this period too, the Norwegian Nobel     Committee continued to honor individuals and organizations that     had worked to strengthen the ethical underpinnings of peace. At     least four of the awards fall under this category: the 1946 joint     awards to Emily     Greene Balch , co-founder and long-time leader of the Women's     International League for Peace and Freedom and the acknowledged     dean of the American peace movement, and to John     Raleigh Mott , long-time executive of the Young Men's Christian     Association (YMCA) and world ecumenical leader working for peace     on the basis of the Bible. Thus, Balch followed closely in the     footsteps of Jane Addams and Mott somewhat less closely than in     those of Nathan Söderblom. In 1947 the prize went to two     arms of the Quaker movement, the Friends     Service Council in Britain and the American     Friends Service Committee , for their work for social justice     and peace, certainly including their relief work during and after     the Second World War.\nThe humanitarian category of Peace Prize Laureates     was well established through the prizes to Dunant, the two to     the ICRC, to Nansen and to the Nansen Office. In this period it     could be argued that at least in part, the prizes to Mott and     to the Quakers and certainly the prize to the UN High Commissioner     for Refugees fell in this category. Another clear-cut example     was the prize for 1952 to Albert     Schweitzer , the well-known medical missionary in Gabon who     had started his work there as early as 1913. Schweitzer's ethical     philosophy rested on the concept of \"reverence for life.\" In the     same category was the prize in 1958 to Georges     Pire , Dominican priest and theologian, honored for his work     on behalf of European refugees and even more for the spirit that     animated his work. On the 100th anniversary of the founding of     the Red Cross, the 1963 prize was divided between the Swiss     International Committee of the Red Cross and the international League     of Red Cross Societies , representing the two major arms of     the Red Cross movement.\nNeither was the disarmament category a new     one. Possibly the prizes to Suttner and Arnoldson (who had favored     an appeal stating, among other things, that \"I want all armed     forces to be abolished\") and certainly to Henderson and Ossietzky     could be seen as falling in this category. The continuity with     the past was most clearly seen in the award in 1959 to Philip     J. Noel-Baker . Noel-Baker had helped found both the League     of Nations and the United Nations. His special interest was still     disarmament and he had participated in the League's Conference     on Disarmament in 1932. With the introduction of nuclear weapons,     his work for disarmament became even more insistent. The biggest     surprise in this category was the prize for 1962, awarded in 1963,     to Linus     Carl Pauling . Pauling had won the Nobel     Chemistry Prize in 1954 , but he then became increasingly preoccupied     with the hazards of the nuclear arms race. He worked hard to bring     about a test-ban treaty and the respect accorded him was strengthened     by the signing of the partial test-ban treaty of 1963. Still,     in many American circles Pauling was considered to harbor pro-Communist     sympathies. The Western-oriented majority of the Norwegian Nobel     Committee was actually against giving him the prize. What secured     him the prize was chairman Jahn's threat to resign from the committee     unless Pauling got it. Jahn, too, had become increasingly preoccupied     with the danger of nuclear weapons.\nOne important category of Peace Prize Laureates     was fully established in this period - those who worked for human     rights. Some of the earlier Laureates had touched upon elements     of human rights, although they had been primarily honored for     other contributions. This went for Buisson, founder of the French     League of the Rights of Man, Ossietzky, honored also for his right     to speak out on the armament question, and Jouhaux, champion of     economic and social rights. The first definite human rights prize     was probably still the one for 1960 to Albert     John Lutuli . The Zulu chief had been elected president-general     of the African National Congress in 1952 and held this position     until his death in 1967. He was thus in the very forefront of     the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, a struggle which     was receiving added international attention after the Sharpville     massacre of March 1960. In a period when the ANC was about to     change its tactics, Lutuli stood explicitly for non-violence.     The Peace Prize to Lutuli is also often seen as signaling a change     in the selection of Laureates in a more global direction. (More     about this shortly.) In 1964 American civil rights leader Martin     Luther King Jr. received the Peace Prize for his non-violent     struggle against segregation, the American version of apartheid.\n1967-1989: The Cold War and the Globalization     of the Prize\nIn the mid-1960s the membership of the Norwegian     Nobel Committee changed. The Labor party lost its majority in     1965, and Jahn retired at the end of 1966. Labor held the chairmanship     under Nils Langhelle (1967), Aase Lionæs (1968-1978), the     first woman leader, and John Sanness (1979-1981). Lionæs     had become a member of the committee as early as 1949; she was     in fact the only woman on the committee until 1979. She was also     the only one of the pre-1965 members continuing on the committee.     Lionæs had tried to secure the Peace Prize for Eleanor Roosevelt,     but failed; in general she did not particularly push female candidates.     The non-Socialist majority held the chairmanship under conservative     Bernt Ingvaldsen (1967) and Egil Aarvik (1983-1990) of the Christian     People's Party, but it too rarely acted in unison. So, as in the     earlier period, personal views were more important than party    loyalties. In this period there were only three irregular prizes.\nAfter 1965 political power fluctuated between     Labor and non-socialist governments, but differences between the     major parties were small on most foreign policy questions, with     the primary exception of the very divisive issue of Norwegian     membership in the European Community. In the Middle East, traditionally     strong sympathies for Israel were increasingly balanced by a growing     understanding of the Palestinian/Arab cause. Support for the UN     remained very strong; the same was the case with backing for NATO,     although the Vietnam war was to accelerate a more critical attitude     to the United States, particularly among youth and the increasingly     important women groups. Impatience with the limited results achieved     in arms control and disarmament, particularly on the nuclear side,     was growing. On the Norwegian Nobel Committee this impatience     was reflected in Chairman Aarvik's personal views. Norway's interest     in human rights in most corners of the world was clearly also     rising.\nIn this period four prizes were awarded to     UN-related activities. In 1968, during the UN International Rights     Year, and exactly twenty years after the approval by the UN General     Assembly of the Declaration of Human Rights, René Cassin received     the Peace Prize. Cassin was generally considered the father of     the declaration, but had also served as vice-president and then     as president of the European Court of Human Rights. (He had also     been a French delegate to the League of Nations.) In 1969 the International     Labour Organization (ILO) was honored. ILO was established     in 1919 and it was the only organization associated with the League     of Nations to outlive it; as a specialized agency of the UN, its     work rested on the principle that peace had to be based on social     justice. In 1981, on its thirtieth anniversary, the Office     of the High Commissioner for Refugees received its second     Peace Prize. Norway as a country had long made the largest per     capita contribution of any country to this UN office. In 1988     the United     Nations Peacekeeping Forces were honored. There was a strong     feeling that as the Cold War was coming to an end, the UN ought     to become more important and that this would be reflected in a     new role for peacekeeping. In addition, the 1982 Peace Prize to     Sweden's Alva     Myrdal and Mexico's Alfonso     García Robles could be considered at least in part     a UN prize, since much of their disarmament work had been done     in various UN negotiations.\nAgain no Communist politician was awarded     the Peace Prize. Instead the human rights prizes to the Soviet     dissident, and one-time creator of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, Andrei     Dmitrievich Sakharov in 1975, to Polish labor leader Lech     Walesa in 1983, and to the 14th Dalai Lama in Tibet, Tenzin     Gyatso , in 1989, the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre,     were severely criticized by the Communist leadership in the three     countries involved. Again the neutralist movement as such went     unrecognized. On the Western side, German Chancellor Willy     Brandt received the prize in 1971 for his Ostpolitik,     an effort to bring East and West Germany, as well as Eastern and     Western Europe, closer together. Brandt had spent the years from     1933 to 1945 in exile in Norway and Sweden, had excellent connections     with Norwegian politicians and spoke perfect Norwegian. In 1974     former Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku     Sato received the Peace Prize for his renunciation of the     nuclear option for Japan and his efforts to further regional reconciliation.     Sato was the first Asian to accept the Peace Prize, to the surprise     of many in that part of the world, including even in Japan, who     saw him as a rather conventional politician.\nIn 1973 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded     to US National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Henry     A. Kissinger and North Vietnamese leader and negotiator Le     Duc Tho for the 1973 Paris agreement intended to bring about     a cease-fire in the Vietnam war and a withdrawal of the American     forces. This award is definitely the most controversial one in     the history of the Nobel Peace Prize. Le Duc Tho declined the     Peace Prize, the only person to have done so, since there was     still no peace agreement. Kissinger did not come to Oslo to receive     the prize in person and soon indicated he wanted to return it,     but was told the statutes did not permit this; two of the committee     members resigned after it had become known that there had been     disagreement and that they had in fact been against the award.     (They supported Brazilian archbishop Helder Camara, who received     a Norwegian people's prize instead.) Public reaction to the prize,     both in Norway and internationally, was largely negative.\nThe 1973 controversy may have influenced the     Storting to establish a new precedent under which the legislators     themselves could no longer be members of the newly re-named Norwegian     Nobel Committee. The members now tended to be either ex-politicians     or persons not so explicitly connected with party politics. The     most important reason behind the change, however, was a general     desire to distinguish more clearly between the Storting itself     and the non-parliamentary committees it appointed.\nRegional crises represented nothing new in     the Cold War. The Nobel Committee had previously awarded prizes     to those who had worked to solve such crises, whether this be     the crucial Franco-German conflict or the war between Paraguay     and Bolivia. With the Cold War and the end of Western colonial     rule over large parts of the world, such crises took on added     prominence, also for the Nobel Committee. The situation in the     Middle East was particularly difficult. In 1950 Ralph Bunche and     in 1957 Lester Pearson had received the Peace Prize for their     efforts there. In 1978, Egyptian President Mohamed     Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem     Begin were honored for the Camp David Agreement, which brought     about a negotiated peace between Egypt and Israel. This agreement     too, proved controversial. Only Begin came to Oslo to receive     the award. A technicality prevented the American president, Jimmy     Carter, from being the third Laureate; the committee actually     wanted to include him, but he had not been nominated when the     deadline expired on February 1 of that year.\nIn Western Europe the situation in Northern     Ireland represented the bloodiest ethnic-national conflict. The     Peace Prize for 1976 was awarded to Betty     Williams and Mairead     Corrigan for their efforts to end that conflict through a     popular mobilization against violence. In Norway the Nobel Committee     was strongly criticized for being late in recognizing the two     women; they had in fact been given a Norwegian people's peace     prize before the Nobel one. In 1987 Oscar     Arias Sánchez , Costa Rica's president, was honored     for his leadership in having the five presidents of Central America     sign a peace agreement for the area. Both of these awards could     be seen as the intervention of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in     conflicts where progress toward peace had definitely been made,     but conflicts had been far from resolved. The committee clearly     hoped that the prize itself would provide an added impetus for     peace. This effect was very limited in Northern Ireland, but more     significant in Central America, although it still took years before     all the many conflicts there were more or less resolved.\nOn the issue of arms control and disarmament,     referred to as \"the reduction of standing armies\" in Nobel's will,     the Nobel Committee, by general Western standards, again proved     relatively radical. This was seen in the 1982 Peace Prize to Alva     Myrdal and Alfonso García Robles, but even more clearly     in the 1985 prize to International     Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) . The     committee had been so impressed by the cooperation between Soviet     and American physicians within the IPPNW that it explicitly invited     founders Evgeny Chazov and Bernard Lown to receive the award on     behalf of the organization. Conservatives in West Germany, Britain,     and the United States particularly criticized the committee's     decision. (So did former committee chair Lionæs.)\nIn this, as in other periods, some humanitarians     were also honored. Somewhat in the tradition of Boyd Orr, Norman     Borlaug , an American of Norwegian descent, was selected in     1970 for his contributions to the \"green revolution\" that was     having such an impact on food production particularly in Asia     and in Latin America. In 1979 Mother     Teresa received the prize. She came from a family of Catholic     Albanians, but lived most of her life in Calcutta, working for     the poorest of the poor through her order, the Missionaries of     Charity.\nAmong the more general peace advocates in     this period, several have already been mentioned: Betty Williams     and Mairead Corrigan, Alva Myrdal and the Dalai Lama. The best     example was perhaps still the 1986 Laureate, Elie     Wiesel . Wiesel was a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust and     had become the leading interpreter of the relevance of this event     for contemporary generations.\nHuman rights represented the fastest growing     field of interest for the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The awards     to the ILO and the Dalai Lama and, even more, to René Cassin,     Andrei Sakharov and Lech Walesa have already been mentioned. In     1974, Seán     MacBride shared the prize with Eisaku Sato. MacBride had a     multi-faceted background, but was honored primarily for his strong     interest in human rights: piloting the European Convention on Human Rights through the Council of Europe, helping found and     then lead Amnesty     International and serving as secretary-general of the International     Commission of Jurists. In 1977 the prize was awarded to Amnesty     International itself. Founded in 1961, it was an increasingly     important organization aimed particularly at protecting the human     rights of prisoners of conscience. In 1980 the Argentinian human     rights activist Adolfo     Peréz Esquivel was honored. Esquivel had founded non-violent     human rights organizations to fight the military junta that was     ruling his country. His message was also seen as relevant for     much of the rest of Latin America. The apartheid regime in South     Africa continued to preoccupy the Nobel Committee and the Norwegian     public. In 1984 Bishop Desmond     Mpilo Tutu was recognized for his non-violent struggle to     bring apartheid to an end. The South African government strongly     disliked the award, as it had Lutuli's, but again it let the Laureate     travel to Oslo to receive it.\nIt was only in this period that the Nobel     Peace Prize became truly global in its approach. The first Peace     Prize to a person not from Europe and North America had been the     one to Lamas in 1936. The next one was Lutuli's in 1960. Yet,     even Lutuli's prize did not really signal an unmistakable trend,     since only from the 1970s onwards did the Nobel Committee regularly     award Asians (Le Duc Tho, Eisaku Sato, the Dalai Lama, in a sense     also Mother Teresa), Africans (Anwar Sadat, Desmond Tutu) and     Latin Americans (Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, Alfonso García     Robles, Oscar Arias Sánchez). Thus, in the 1970s and 1980s     there were as many Laureates from Africa, Asia, and Latin America     combined as from North America and Western Europe combined. (In     addition there were Andrei Sakharov and Lech Walesa from Eastern     Europe and Menachem Begin from Israel.)\nOne may ask why it took the Norwegian Nobel     Committee so long to recognize persons from these other continents.     The answer has several elements. For centuries Europe and North     America dominated the rest of the world. There were few other     independent actors. Reflecting this, very few nominations for     the Nobel Peace Prize were submitted by persons from Asia, Africa     and Latin America. In addition, most Western politicians simply     did not pay much attention to what was going on in these vast     regions; some even considered those who lived there inferior.     Such feelings certainly affected Norwegians too, probably also     some of the members of the Nobel Committee.\nMohandas Gandhi was, however, nominated five     times and he was put on the committee's short list three times.     In 1948 the committee awarded no prize; it indicated that it had     found \"no suitable living candidate\", a reference to Gandhi. It     thus seems likely that he would have been awarded the prize if     he had not been assassinated in January 1948. Still, the committee     had had earlier opportunities to honor the man who, in hindsight,     is generally seen as the leading spokesman of non-violence in     the 20th century. Under the statutes then in force, Gandhi could     have been awarded even the 1948 prize, as seen by the posthumous     prize awarded to Hammarskjöld in 1961. Yet, a posthumous     prize was an obvious complication. Gandhi had his supporters on     the committee, but the majority felt that despite his own non-violence,     violence had sometimes resulted from his actions, even before     the bloody division between India and Pakistan; he was also perceived     as too much of an Indian nationalist. Such feelings might have     been affected by Norway's traditionally very close relationship     to Britain, by a rapidly growing skepticism to neutrality in the     Cold War and even by a more general underestimation of individuals     from \"underdeveloped\" parts of the world.\nThe reaction to apartheid in South Africa     after the Sharpeville massacre was to modify such underestimation,     but, as we have seen, this happened rather slowly. The decolonization     process in Asia and Africa certainly also had an impact. All forms     of racial stereotyping were banned from civilized public discourse.     The growing emphasis on human rights furthered the globalization     of the prize, as did the emphasis on finding a solution to regional     crises in different parts of the world.\n1990 - : Pluralist Globalization\nAround 1990 huge changes were taking place     internationally. The Cold War came to an end, with the collapse     of the Soviet empire in 1989 and of the Soviet Union itself in     1991. Expectations were high for the new post-Cold War world,     but it soon became obvious that an end to the Cold War did not     signal the end of war and conflict. The arms race slowed down     considerably, but it still continued in various parts of the world.     Old conflicts lingered; many new ones arose. Human rights advanced     greatly, with the emergence of new democracies in Central and     Eastern Europe, in Latin America and Asia, and even in Africa,     but almost half the world's population still lived under some     form of dictatorship. The composition of the Norwegian Nobel Committee     underwent few dramatic changes in the 1990s. The committee majority     again moved left of center in terms of Norwegian politics, with     the Labor party having two representatives and the Socialist Left     one. After Aarvik's death in 1990, Labor's Gidske Anderson served     as chair of the committee for only half a year, until illness     forced her to step down. The committee chairman from 1991 to 1999,     Francis Sejersted, was a Conservative professor of history. In     2000 former Labor cabinet minister Gunnar Berge became the new     chairman. From 1979 the committee regularly had two women members;     from 2000 it even had a female majority. In the 1990s the prize    was awarded on a regular basis every year.\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee celebrated the     end of the Cold War with the 1990 Peace Prize to Mikhail     Sergeyevich Gorbachev , President of the Soviet Union, the     person who, in the Committee's opinion, had done more than any     one else to bring the Cold War to an end. Encouraged by the end     of the Cold War, the committee was also prepared to intervene     even more frequently than before in regional conflicts around     the world in the hope that the Nobel Peace Prize could not only     award deeds done, but also provide an added incentive for peace.     The prize in 1993 to Nelson     Mandela and Frederik     Willem de Klerk could be regarded as a success in that respect,     although it came at a stage when most of the transition from apartheid     to democracy had already been accomplished.\nIn 1994, the Peace Prize was awarded to Palestinian     leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak     Rabin and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon     Peres for the Oslo Agreement, which brought about a mutual     recognition and a framework for peace between the Palestine Liberation     Organization (PLO) and Israel. The three politicians had accomplished     much, but they were still far from establishing a final peace     between Israelis and Palestinians. The award resulted in one member     leaving the committee, the leading spokesman in Norway for the     Likud party in Israel. This was the third resignation in the history     of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. In 1996, the prize was awarded     to East Timorese leaders Bishop Carlos     Filipe Ximenes Belo and José Ramos-Horta. The     tragic situation in East Timor after the Indonesian invasion in     1975 had been almost forgotten internationally. Due to the effect     of the Nobel Peace Prize and, even more, of the Indonesian economic     and political collapse in 1997-1998, East Timor was able to start     on the road toward independence. In 1998 the committee honored     Northern Irish leaders John     Hume and David     Trimble . Through the Good Friday Agreement of that year, the     major parties to that protracted conflict agreed on the principles     for its resolution, although it might take years before the agreement     is fully implemented. In 2000 the Peace Prize was awarded to South     Korean President Kim     Dae-jung , both for his \"sunshine policy\" of contacts and cooperation     with North Korea and his long-standing commitment to human rights     in South Korea and elsewhere.\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee also further     strengthened its somewhat radical profile within the field of     arms control and disarmament. Two such prizes were awarded in     the 1990s. The first one came in 1995, on the 50th anniversary     of the atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to Joseph     Rotblat and the Pugwash     Conferences on Science and World Affairs . Rotblat had initially     worked on the Manhattan Project, which created the bombs, but     had left the project to take up a life-long struggle against nuclear     weapons. He had helped create the Pugwash Conferences where since     1957, scientists from the United States, the Soviet Union and     many other countries had met in an effort to reduce the role of     nuclear weapons in international relations. The second prize came     in 1997 when the International     Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and its coordinator, Jody     Williams , were honored for their work to ban and remove anti-personnel     land mines and to support the victims of such mines.\nIn the 1990s the human rights tradition was     extended by prizes to two women. In 1991 the Peace Prize was awarded     to Aung     San Suu Kyi , the leader of the opposition against the Burmese     military regime. Her party won an overwhelming victory in the     1990 election, but she was then confined to house arrest. While     her cause now came to receive broad international support, the     military regime continued in power. Somewhat more controversial     was the 1992 award, on the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery     of America, to Rigoberta     Menchú Tum , the Maya Indian campaigner for human, particularly     indigenous, rights in Guatemala and the rest of Latin America.     The humanitarian tradition was continued through the 1999 award     to Médecins     Sans Frontières (MSF) - or Doctors Without Borders     - for its \"pioneering humanitarian efforts on several continents.\" The     work of MSF clearly had a human rights dimension in addition to     the humanitarian one. As already mentioned, the 2000 award to     Kim Dae Jung also combined two traditional elements in the history     of the Peace Prize.\nThe Nobel Peace Prize through 100 Years:     Some Conclusions\nThus, some lines of development can be distinguished     in the almost 100 year history of the Nobel Peace Prize. First,     although the Norwegian Nobel Committee never formally defined \"peace,\" in     practice it came to interpret the term ever more broadly. This     approach could have its pitfalls, but avoided the danger of locking     the committee into fixed categories and gave the committee flexibility     to adapt to new concerns. In the early years, the emphasis was     definitely on the organized peace movement and the codification     of international law, but even in the very first year of the Peace     Prize the first humanitarian, and five years later, the first     statesman were selected. Later the balance shifted away from the     organized peace movement and international jurists, although some     of them continued to be selected and the category came to include     church leaders and even a Holocaust interpreter. Humanitarians     became more numerous, and this category came to include scientists     who worked to alleviate hunger. Disarmers became more numerous     too, and this category came to include those who supported limited     arms control and not necessarily full disarmament. Different kinds     of statesmen were awarded the Peace Prize, some for addressing     global concerns, others for helping to solve regional crises,     still others for the general principles they espoused. The human     rights category was added to the list and gradually became perhaps    the most numerous one.\nSecond, from a slow start, the list of Laureates     became increasingly global, so that by the 1970s all continents     except Australia and Oceania were represented. In the nominations     and correspondence to the committee, it is easy to see how a prize     to one continent stimulated interest in the prize in this area.     Third, although Bertha von Suttner was awarded the Peace Prize     in 1905, particularly in the early decades few women were selected.     In recent decades, this too has changed, although not as dramatically     as the geographical distribution of the Laureates, so that by     2000 ten women have received the Nobel Peace Prize. Fourth, the     Norwegian Nobel Committee has increasingly come to use the Peace     Prize not only as a reward for achievements accomplished, but     also as an incentive for the Laureates to achieve even more. This     may be said to reflect the growing courage of the committee members     or, perhaps more accurately, the increasing stature of the Nobel     Peace Prize.\nNo prize will be able to establish a \"perfect\" historical     record, whatever that might be. Most observers will agree that     the omission of Gandhi from the list of Nobel Laureates is a serious     one, but it might be the only one of such a nature. There may     well have been some Laureates that perhaps should not have received     the prize, but still did. But there is not much of a consensus     on which ones these Laureates are. Controversy is certainly no     good judge in this respect. (These days, when even Mother Teresa     is considered controversial by some, it may also be difficult     to know what is controversial.) In historical hindsight, several     of the more controversial prizes are now considered among the     most successful ones (Ossietzky, Lutuli, Sakharov, the Dalai Lama,     Gorbachev). On the other hand, the prize to Kissinger and Le Duc     Tho shows that controversy is no guarantee of historical success.     On the whole, however, after taking into consideration what a     treacherous field \"peace\" is and also the record of the many other     peace prizes, it can certainly be argued that the standing of     the Nobel Peace Prize would not have been what it is if it had     not been for its highly respectable record.\nThis essay has attempted to place the history     of the prize within a Norwegian context. This is natural since     the committee members through these 100 years have all been Norwegians.     Until 1936 they sometimes included even prominent members of the     Norwegian government; until the 1970s they were frequently members     of the Storting. Later they were often ex-politicians, many of     them having served in prominent positions. Some of the politicians     honored, from Roosevelt to Arafat, Peres and Rabin, may well have     served Norwegian state interests in the sense that their selection     fitted well into government policy. On the more speculative side,     the non-award to Gandhi may also have been influenced by Norway's     close relationship to Britain, and after the Second World War     any award to the leading figures behind the movement toward European     economic and political integration was clearly difficult in a     country as divided on that issue as was Norway. (Brandt was only     a partial exception.) On the other hand, some of the committee's     selections were clearly problematic from the point of view of     the Norwegian government. The best illustrations of this were     probably the awards to Ossietzky and the Dalai Lama.\nIn principle almost everyone would prefer     a Nobel Committee with an international membership. In practice,     however, an international committee would have faced serious problems.     (What would such a committee have done during the Cold War?) The     connections to Norwegian values, as well as to Norwegian politics,     may be regarded as questionable for the prestige of the Peace     Prize, but it may in fact have had its advantages. Thus, after     the Second World War hardly any term has been and still is more     popular in Norwegian foreign policy parlance than \"bridge-building.\" While     an increasingly rich Northern state firmly attached to the West     and with strong sympathies for Israel, Norway has been concerned     with building bridges to the East, to the South, and increasingly     to the Palestinians and other Arabs. It is a separate question     how realistic such attitudes are as a basis for a country's foreign     policy, but as a basis for prize selections, a blend of idealism     and realism may not be so bad.\nThe values that underpinned the Nobel Peace     Prize were concretely defined by Norwegians, but they were part     of a wider Scandinavian and Western context. They represented     the Norwegian version of Western liberal internationalism. Thus,     the Norwegian Nobel Committee has been a strong believer in international     organizations, from the Inter-Parliamentary Union to the League     of Nations and the United Nations. Organizations and rules had     been employed to contain conflicts within Norway; they could also     temper international strife. Small nations almost instinctively     prefer international law to the might they do not possess, and     they believe in the arbitration, mediation and peaceful solution     of international disputes. In a similar way, the Nobel Committee     believed in humanitarian assistance to the weak and the poor,     in arms control and disarmament, and, more and more fervently,     in human rights generally.\nWhen we look at the nationalities of the Laureates,     we also get an idea of where liberal internationalism has been     most strongly represented (or has been perceived by the Norwegian     Nobel Committee as being most strongly represented). Virtually     all of the organizations honored had clear roots in this Western     ideology. Although liberal internationalism was in many ways ideally     suited for smaller powers, it also had many supporters in the     Great Powers. On the individual side, nineteen of the Laureates     have come from the United States, representing both leading politicians     - two presidents, one vice-president, five secretaries of state     - and those more distant from and skeptical to the centers of     power (Addams, Balch, Pauling, King, Williams); twelve have come     from Great Britain, again reflecting both traditions, Austen Chamberlain     and Joseph Rotblat perhaps representing the extremes; eight have     been French, four have been German. Five have been Swedish (Arnoldson,     Branting, Söderblom, Hammarskjöld and Myrdal). Two have     been Norwegian (Lange, Nansen).\nThus, perhaps, in compiling its record through     these 100 years, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has actually been     able to be both very Norwegian and quite international at the     same time.\n* Published as a chapter of the book: \"The Nobel Prize: The First 100 Years\",     Agneta Wallin Levinovitz and Nils Ringertz, eds., Imperial     College Press and World     Scientific Publishing Co.

Bunche (pictured) achieved a few firsts as an African American, but none may be more more notable than the political scientist and academic winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950. Becoming the first Black person to win the coveted award, Dr. Bunche maintained a dignified stance despite the rampant segregation he and others like him faced.\nSEE ALSO: Comedian, Entertainer Redd Foxx Was Born On This Day In 1922\nBorn Ralph Johnson Bunche on August 7, 1903, or 1904 in Detroit, his early life involved some shuffling around before settling with his family in New Mexico. As a young boy, he lost his mother and brother, which led to he and his sister relocating to Los Angeles to live with his grandmother, Lucy Taylor Johnson.\nBunche’s move to California proved fruitful, and with the push from his grandmother, he excelled in academics and sports. After obtaining his undergraduate degree from the University of California, Bunche continued his studies at Harvard University.\nThere, he would become the first African American to obtain a political doctorate from the lauded institution in 1934.\nBunche was not seen as a radical advocate for racial equality, opting instead to use education as a means to make balance in the world. However, he did exhibit a willingness to look at racial discrimination with a discerning eye. Historians still maintain that Bunche was largely moderate in his political pursuits all the same.\nBunche’s work in the early formation of the United Nations would prove to be one of his more significant moves. During World War II, Bunche worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which would later spawn the CIA. He later joined the State Department before joining a planning committee for the United Nations in 1945.\nBunche later joined the UN’s secretariat and was instrumental in peace negotiations as a mediator between Arab and Israeli forces in the troubled Palestine region. From 1947 to 1949, Bunche served as a bridge of communication between the two sides and sparked the signing of the Armistice Agreements . The Agreements would signal the official end of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948.\nFor his efforts, Bunche was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the first Black man and person of color to win the award. Bunche’s legendary work caught the attention of then-President Harry Truman, who wanted the mediator to join his cabinet as the assistant Secretary of State.\nBunche reportedly turned the job down, because he realized his family would endure racism and segregation despite his weighty job title.\nAfter several years of humanitarian work and remaining a staunch advocate of peaceful negotiations between warring nations, Bunche’s journey would come to an end in New York City. After suffering several ailments, Bunche passed away on December 8, 1971, at the age of 68.\nBunche’s legacy is firmed by an impressive list of awards, honors, tributes, and honorary degrees too numerous to list. This proves without doubt that Dr. Bunche’s work was not only vital in the annals of history for Black Americans, but also the entire globe.\nLearn more about Dr. Ralph J. Bunche here .\n\n"
