Teaspoons and cups are non-metric units of volume, which are mostly used in the United States and other countries with the English measurement system. These units are typical for pharmaceutical prescriptions and cooking recipes.\nIn the countries, where the metric system has been introduced, teaspoons and cups are rarely used to measure volume. Liters and milliliters are much more convenient for this purpose. But if you live in a European country, do not think that you will never come across cups, tablespoons or teaspoons. You can find them in some cookbooks, especially if they are written by foreign writers.\nBefore we start talking about how many teaspoons there are in a cup, we will mention that many people can confuse the teaspoon with the tablespoon. For the most part, it happens because of the similar abbreviations of these units (T., Ts., Tbls., Tb. for the tablespoon, and t., ts., tsp., tspn.). As you see, even if the letters are the same, the abbreviation of the tablespoon is always written with the capital letter “T”.\nHow Many US Teaspoons in a US Cup\nAs it is stated above, teaspoons, tablespoons and cups are mostly used in the USA, so we will talk about US units of volume to give the right answer to the question, “How many teaspoons are there in a cup?” And this answer is simple:\nOne US cup consists of 48 US teaspoons.\nWhen you are going to calculate the number of teaspoons in some cups, just multiply the cups by 48.
