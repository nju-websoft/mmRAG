As early as 4000 B.C. (before Christ), games became a source of entertainment. At that time, people of Babylon played a game that preceded the present day game of chess.\n \n4000 BC -  A Babylonian game, which is the ancestor of  modern draughts  begins to be played\n \n3000 BC - First Game resembling modern Backgammon is played in Sumeria.\n \n2000 BC - Stone marbles first used in Egypt.\n \n1000 BC - Kites appear in China.

Poor Children - Poor families made their own, such as cloth-peg dolls and paper windmills. Children would save their pocket money to buy marbles, a spinning top, skipping ropes, kites or cheap wooden toys.\n \nRich Children had rocking horses with real horse hair manes, and dolls houses full of beautifully-carved miniature furniture. Other popular toys for rich children included china or wax dolls for the girls and clockwork train sets for the boys. Girls played with dolls and tea sets whilst boys played with toy soldiers and marbles.\n \nDuring Victorian times, people became fascinated by toys that made pictures move. One of the earliest and simplest of these was the thaumatrope. This is a disc with a picture on either side that is attached to two pieces of string or a stick. When you spin the disc quickly, the two pictures appear to combine into one.\n \n1901 - Meccano goes on sale in the UK.

Parents went to desperate measures to secure a Buzz Lightyear doll. The rights to produce toys from the film went to a small independent Canadian toy company who simply could not cope with the demand. Why? Because all of the major toy manufacturers turned down the chance to make Toy Story merchandise, as they felt that the movie would never catch on.

Closely followed by Pogo Sticks which enjoyed a resurgence of interest this year.\n \n2002 - Bratz Dolls, steal some of Barbie’s position as top fashion doll, a place she has held since she was born in 1959.

However Yucky Yo Balls are swiftly banned by the government over safety fears. This is the first time that the government has banned a toy in over 10 years.\n \n2004 - Toy of the Year 'Terrain Twister' radio controlled vehicle.\n \n2005 - Fisher-Price top-selling Dora's Talking House\"\n \n2006 - The overall winner of the title Toy Of The Year 2006 was awarded to the Dr Who Cyberman Voice Changer Mask.

The year before it went to a set of toys from In the Night Garden. The theme seems to be a toy connected to a popular children's television character and this will probably be the same pattern for the best selling toy of 2009/2010. Young children love toys that are familiar, toys that they identify with the television characters that they see. In 2008 the pre school toy of the year was again, In the Night Garden and toys such as Star Wars and toys featuring Thomas the Tank engine (pre school toys of the year in 2005) regularly win toy awards.\n \nHasbro is the largest toy manufacturer in the world.\n \nThe 20th century saw the invention of dozens of much-loved toys as well. Still-popular board games like Tripoley, Sorry and Monopoly have been around since the 1930s, and Crayola Crayons are more than 100 years old! Twister, made by a division of Hasbro, sold more than 3 million games within a year of its release in 1966. It has sold more than 22 million since then.\n \nToys aren't always a hit the year, or even the decade, they're created. Unemployed architect Alfred Mosher Butts invented the game of Scrabble, which he first called \"Lexiko\" and later \"Criss-Cross Words,\" in the 1930s. Entrepreneur James Brunot acquired the game in 1947, but it wasn't until 1953, when the president of Macy's — now owned by retail giant Federated Department Stores — discovered the game on vacation that things really took off. More than 100 million sets have since been sold worldwide.\n \nThe fortunes of other playthings are more cyclical. Troll dolls, which hit big during the 1960s, had all but disappeared by the 1980s until troll nostalgia ushered in a second boom in the early 1990s. As Generation Xers grow older, toys like Cabbage Patch Kids, now made by Mattel, and Koosh balls could stage a comeback as well.\n \nAnd there's serious money to be had. Mr. Potato Head, made in 1952 by Hasbro's Playskool unit, was the first toy advertised on television, and it grossed more than $4 million in its first year (that's $30 billion in 2005 dollars). Play-doh, which was originally designed for cleaning wallpaper, made inventor Joseph McVicker a millionaire by his 27th birthday. And Mattel sells an astounding 1.5 million Barbie dolls each week — that's two dolls per second.\nDone\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\n... What was the first country ...

Corgi James Bond Aston Martin DB5 C270 Corgi James Bond Aston Martin DB5 C270\nHistory      of the 270 and its earlier smaller brother, the 261.\nShould you wish to know a little bit about this cars development please read      on.\nThe      Corgi 261 and 270:\nThe 261 was THE car that propelled Corgi into becoming the dominant force      in the diecast toy market in the late 60's and 70's. It was released in October      1965 and was an outright smash hit with the children of the day.\nWhy was it so in demand? Simply, because it was jam packed full of features      and was a miniature work of engineering genius. Most diecast cars of this      age (particularly Dinky cars) had very few (if any) gimmicks or features.      The 261 had an, opening roof, ejector seat, bullet proof rear shield and telescopic      overriders. Factor in the ejectable baddie, the accessory pack and 2 stage      box and this was THE only toy to have at Christmas 1965.\nA casualty of packing in all these features was the spring 'Glidematic' suspension      - with plastic suspension being fitted instead. This was a shame as this was      a weak point of the 261, and the subsequent 270, with the plastic becoming      fragile with age and use resulting in often broken or damaged suspension units.\nThe DB5 from the film was silver so why did Corgi paint the the 261 gold?      This was simply because the silver paint Corgi initially proposed to use looked      too much like the Zinc base metal that the car was made from and so it didn't      look as though it had been painted. With not enough time to find a suitable      paint before the models release date Corgi painted it Gold in reference to      the films title.\nCorgi obviously wanted to correct this and the 270 was put on the drawing      board. Slightly bigger than the 261, the 270 packed in even more features!!!      All those from the 261 remained but additionally, the number plates rotated      - as per the film - and a pair of 'tyreslashers' were added to the rear wheels.\nInitially, the 270 was shipped in a bubble box with a similar instruction      envelope, similar baddies and the same lapel badge as the 261. The instruction      sheet was different, obviously, also it was red/black/white as opposed to      blue/black/white for the 261. The most noteable addition was a set of 9 number      plate stickers. Somewhere around 1969/1970, the box was changed to a window      box (predominantly coloured blue and yellow - similar to the 1st 267 Batmobile      window box). This is one rare beastie as it had a short production run; it      was replaced by the darker blue window box.\nThe instructions changed to black and white around the time of the window      box introduction - I'm not sure if any 1st window box cars shipped with colour      intructions and would appreciate any thoughts/advice on this. Finally, the      lapel badge changed to the 'Luger' style one as used for the 336 Toyota.\n \n \nChapter      One - The James Bond DB5 Story Begins\nMy      first recollection of James Bond was a birthday treat in the early 1970s to      see a re-run of Dr No with my father and a couple of school friends. I don’t      recall much of the day, only the sheer excitement and awe of the experience      and the final seconds of Dr No, before he slipped beneath the radioactive      broth, unable to cease his descent owing to the lack of grip you get from      metal hands on metal railings. I was, from that day, hooked on Bond and had      as my most favoured toy, a silver die-cast model with more gadgets than you      could shake a stick at. This was the Corgi 270, the “New” James      Bond Aston Martin DB5. What I did not appreciate at the time was that this      model was the second James Bond DB5 that Corgi had produced and that it would      turn out to be the most famous car of all time.\nThis site is dedicated to my formative memory of Bond and that toy car which      I rediscovered some 30 years later in a brick-a-brack store at a local market.      Co-incidentally this discovery was preceded by a chance visit to the Exeter      Toy Fair where I spied upon a silver DB5, which while in mint condition was      without its box and still priced up at £45; on further study I noticed      the Made in China stamp on the base, pointing to it being a later release      and started to think, if only I had kept hold of my childhood model.\nFollowing these unrelated events, the die was cast and whether I liked it      or not, the obsessive fire within was lit and my search was on to rediscover      the world of Corgi’s James Bond DB5. This is my story, told with the      help of those who have followed this path before, of how fine a line it is      between a healthy interest and an obsession, a nerd and a geek (a geek by      the way knows he is a geek) and that if anything is worth doing it is worth      doing to excess! Most importantly, this is the story of Corgi and the James      Bond DB5.\nChapter      Two - The First Issue 1965 - 1968\nThe      first Corgi Aston Martin DB5 was born out of a meeting held by Eon Productions,      owners of the James Bond franchise, in the summer of 1965 to discuss the promotion      of their next Bond film, Thunderball. Until now, 007 merchandising had focused,      as had the film producers, on the adult audiences but with this 4th Bond film      due to feature more gadgets than ever before the potential of appealing to      a broader audience and the opportunity to extend merchandising into the then      lucrative and untapped toy market was an attraction which could not be missed.\nPresent at this meeting was Playcraft Toys Ltd, the subsidiary company of      Mettoy, responsible for the manufacture of diecast toys. Following this meeting      agreement was reached for Playcraft to release the      first Corgi Aston Martin DB5 (C261) in October 1965 , two months before      the release of Thunderball and almost a year after the DB5 first hit the screen      and was seen by audiences around the world in Goldfinger.\nThe model was a instant success and by the end of the year, after only three      months, sales were sufficient to earn Playcraft the award of “Best Boys      Toy of 1965”.\nAlthough in the films Goldfinger and Thunderball, Bond’s DB5 was silver,      the Corgi marketing team felt, when looking at the early prototypes, that      customers would think the model was unpainted and a radical decision was reached      to release the model painted gold! Whether one of the team also suggested      that a gold model would relate better to its film origins is just a wild thought      of mine is probably just that, the truth of the matter though, is that the      first Corgi James Bond DB5 was gold.\nThe model was launched at a cost 9s 11d, around 50p in today’s money      and a month’s pocket money in 1965, but this did nothing to deter buyers      as by the end of 1966, Playcraft had sold a staggering 2.7 million models!\nThree      designers set about the retooling of the existing DB4, withdrawn from production      to make way for the DB5, to completed the DB5 in time for the 1965 Christmas      launch. The model was made up of 28 separate parts and it is said that the      tooling of this car cost in the region of £45,000. The one error in      the first model, only spotted by Aston Martin owners and those with an obsessive      eye for detail was that the model passed through quality control with the      DB4’s rear end, noticeable by the different light cluster and single      petrol cap!\nCorgi was perhaps the most innovative die-cast manufacturer of the period,      placing its closest rival Dinky in the shade. It was therefore, not surprising,      although it was in its day, that Corgi should release a model of such a small      scale with so many gadgets. Within the 1:46 scale, 97mm casing, the engineers      fitted an ejector seat, front mounted machine guns and bumper rams and a rear      bullet-proof screen; all of which were operated by depressing secret buttons      and levers secreted around the car, the bullet-proof screen, for instance      was raised by pushing in the exhaust pipes.\nThere was only one version of the C261 produced, although      due to the high demand, two castings were actually used in the manufacture      and this resulted in two undocumented differences in the models produced,      namely: a slight variation in the front wing vent slots and rear light clusters,      only noticeable if you have both versions to compare and contrast.\nThe packaging of the Corgi model was also unsurpassed by Playcraft’s      competitors. Its design of an inner sleeve also acting as a display plinth      and hidden compartment store for the secret instructions which accompanied      the model was unique and a feature repeated on subsequent Corgi releases. The C261 came with two packaging variants: for both      the outer boxes were in the traditional blue and yellow colour scheme, but      on some of the plinths produced the words “Secret Instructions” were printed within an arrow shape and the exterior of some outer boxes had      a thick black line drawn around the words “James Bond’s Aston      Martin DB5”.\n1965 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 261 - scale 1/43 with box first edition\n1965 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 261 - scale 1/43 with box second edition\nI      never got to see the C261 DB5 in my youth. It was routing around in a box      of various diecast models of a small brick-a-brack store at a local market      back in April 2008 that I laid eyes on my first C261. It was a battered example,      but everything was in working order. I had at the time not known of a metallic      gold variant, other than the gold plated limited editions that I had clocked      in stores in the 1990s, but this one was different. I noted that the base      reported that is was “Made in Gt Britain” so had an inkling it      was old, just how old I could not be sure. It was price tagged at £12.50,      I offered £10 and the purchase was completed. On returning home, I checked      the web, http://www.theoldtoyguide.com. I learned that this piece of worn      gold painted metal, fashioned into the shape of a Bond’s DB5 with gadgets      a go-go, was a 43 years old C261, the first edition of the Corgi James Bond      Aston Martin DB5. I needed to know more. This was point at which my rediscovery      turned into an obsession.\n \n \nChapter      THREE - The NEW One 1968 - 1976\nBy      1968 the sale of Corgi diecasts was at an all time high. The Bond film of      the previous year, You only live twice, had given us a new 007 Corgi in the      form of the incredibly detailed Toyota 2000GT. This increase in demand and      desire for greater detail led Playcraft to re-launch the James Bond DB5 with      even more features.\nIn February 1968, having sold just short of 4 million models, the C261 was      retooled and increased slightly in size to 1:43 scale. The re-launch was completed      with the “New” James Bond Aston Martin DB5 (C270) painted this time in silver birch to      match the film version and incorporating not only the Q Branch gadgets of      the previous model, but also revolving number plates and rear tyre slashers.      This was the favoured toy model, I remember having back in the early 1970s      as a child.\nThe      packaging was also updated, the carton box was replaced with a plastic blister      pack containing the model sitting on a plinth similar to that of the first      issue. As before, the plinth contained the “Secret Instructions”,      now printed in red and an updated lapel badge, the spare baddie, and a sheet      of number plate stickers to affix to the new front & rear revolving number      plates. Both Bond and baddie were hand painted and the red interior slightly      darker than before. The bumpers and grill were separate castings and the fuel      filler caps and rear light clusters now corrected. What a package!\n1968      - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 270 - scale 1/43\nFor those with a keen eye, in the transfer from film to model, Playcraft made      a couple of number plates changes: while the Swiss plates were correct (LU      6789), the French plates lost the final two digits (62) and the British plates      used the James Bond 007 reference (JB 007 GB) rather than the car’s      real number plate (BMT 216 A). Very early models came with silver-plated bumpers and front grill      but these were very soon changed to gold plate and thus the gilt version      is the more common. This      model was re-released as a limited edition in 1995, and collectors can      easily identify the original by the words “New” and “Made      in Great Britain” embossed into the base of the model; indeed, by the      time the later version was released, the manufacture of the Corgi diecasts      had long been moved to China.\nAt the time of its release in February 1968, the C270 was on sale for 11/-      (55p), by August 1969 it had risen to 11/6 (57p). During 1971 with decimalisation      the price became 68p, in 1972 this rose to 69p and by August 1975 the car’s      price had risen to £1.15. Putting this all into context, in July 2008,      40 years after it’s release, a MIB blister pack model sold on eBay for      the incredible sum of £556.56, that is some return on investment!\nThe value of the diecast model is increased in later years by virtue of having      the box it came in when first purchased. As most children are interested in      the toy within rather the box in which it came, few complete models exist      beyond the first few days of purchase, thus models with their boxes are highly      sought after and attract a higher value. This is simply the law of supply      and demand. So what of the boxes and what should the collector be looking      for?\nIn 1970 the blister packaging was replaced with a window box of the similar      size and utilised artwork of the original. There were two variations, although      very slight: the first had Playcraft’s name printed on the reverse which      was in a later release was altered to Mettoy-Playcraft.\n1970      - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 270 - scale 1/43\nThe      now-familiar blue, yellow and purple striped design, synonymous with the Corgi      diecast range, appeared in 1973 together with a slightly larger box. On the      reverse of this window box was printed the an advertisement for two other      Corgi TV/Film vehicles: The Batmobile and James Bond’s Moonbuggie from      Diamonds are Forever. Instructions were now to be found printed on the underside      and this was the last time that “Secret Instructions” envelope      was provided.\n1973 - Corgi James      Bond D.B. 5 - N° 270 - scale 1/43\nThe      instructions with this model were printed in either black or blue, and with      them were supplied the number plate stickers, lapel badge and the spare baddie.      The name Playcraft was dropped from packaging after this issue, returning      to the original trading name of Mettoy Ltd\n \nChapter      FOUR - The Cost Cutting 1976 - 1977\nIn      1976 the DB5 underwent a third retooling . Although virtually identical      to its 1968 predecessor, cost cutting activities meant that this version was      released with fixed number plates and no tyre slashers, although it still      retained all the gadgets first found on the original 1965 model.\n1976      - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 270 - scale 1/43 - WhizzWheels\nIn      addition to these changes, the metal spoke wheels and rubber tyres were replaced      and moulded plastic took their place with a plated centre giving the appearance      of a separate wheel. It is possible that to make space within the chassis      for this different wheel design the model also now came sporting flared wheel      arches!\nThe      1976 box contained no “Secret Instructions”, these were now printed      on the revers of the box with a photo of the car with all gadgets deployed.      The spare baddie was now placed within a hole in the side of the box interior.\nThis model stayed in production until late 1977 and was the last James Bond      DB5 (or at least for the next 20 years) to be made in the 1:43 scale.\n \n \nChapter      FIVE - The END of the Mettoy 1978 - 1983\nBy      1977 the majority of Mettoy’s Corgi die-casts were 1:36 scale and if      the James Bond DB5 was to stay in production, it needed to fall in line. So      the James Bond Aston Martin DB5 was retooled for the 4th time and the C271      was released in May 1978 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) at a cost £3.00.      Now 130mm in length, the model also featured the return of the Aston Martin      winged badge on the bonnet and the addition of the DB5 badge on the wings      and boot.\n1978 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 271 - scale 1/36\nThe quality in this retooling did not leave us with the same standard of model      of the previous versions. The machine guns no longer protruded from behind      the indicators as in the “real” car, but now popped out from behind      the radiator grill. Despite the larger scale, the rear bullet proof screen      was thinner than before and activated by pressing the extended sections of      rear bumper rather than the exhaust pipes in the earlier model. The front      bumper design was different too.\nThe figures of bond and the baddie had less paint, relying on black and blue      coloured plastic to provide colour to their suites while shirts, face & hands were painted. The centre plated wheels were of the then must have four      spoke “WhizzWheels” design.\nThis model stayed in production through many box variations and changes in      company ownership until 1990, when production at Swansea ceased and moved      to China.\nThe early models shared the same black/yellow boxes      as 1:43 scale model, even down to the mistake of referencing a picture of      its predecessor, but had ‘1:36’ printed on the window tag to highlight      the change in scale. Later C271 models came in black/yellow boxes omitting      the window tag and the final boxes were black/red/yellow.\n1978 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 271 - scale 1/36\nThe      model was re-issued again in 1981, identical to the earlier 1978 issue, but      the packaging (still depicting the 1:43 scale model) now had the operating      features highlighted on the front header card and the instructions on the      rear panel. Bond now only had face and hands painted and the baddie, still      in blue plastic, devoid of any other colour. Two versions were issued, a red      or white interior and dished or 4-spoke wheels.\n1981 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 271 - scale 1/36\n1981      - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 1361 - scale 1/36 & 1/64\nIn 1983 Mettoy re-boxed the C271 and released its final official James Bond      Aston martin DB5. The car, with the same variations as the 1981 model, was      unchanged. Bond, for the first time, however, together with the baddie came      in unpainted blue plastic. The box had lost its header card, gained a small      stand up card stating the title of the model and the secret instructions were      now printed on the inside of the box and viewable through the cellophane window.      By the end of 1983 Mettoy were in receivership and a buy-out looked to be      the only way Corgi could be saved.\n \n1983 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 271 - scale 1/36\nChapter      Six - The Corgi Toys 1984 - 1989\nIn      October 1983 Mettoy Company Limited called in the receivers and by March 1984      a management buy-out , led by Mike Rosser, had formed Corgi Toys Limited.\n \n1984 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 271 - scale 1/36\n \nWith the contract with Eon effectively terminated on the demise of Mettoy,      Corgi Toys had to negotiate the sell off their remaining C271 stocks. Agreement      was reached and a new generic “blue” packaging was produced for      this purpose. The name “James Bond Aston Martin 271” appeared      in small print on the end flaps, and front of the box.\n1985 - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 271/1      - scale 1/36\n \nBetween      1984 and 1990, Corgi produced one final James Bond Aston Martin packaging      variation. With no mention of James Bond on the box, this car was coded 271/1      and was the last 007 die-cast to be made in Gt Britain. This car, as with      the previous version, had 4-spoke or dished wheels, with the figure of Bond      in black and the baddie in light brown, both in unpainted plastic.\nIn December 1989, the management consortium sold Corgi Toys Limited to the      US based toy company Mattel, effectively ending the Gt British manufacture      of Corgi toys and its 45 year relationship with Swansea as operations moved      to Mattel’s HQ in Leicester and production moved to China.\n \n \nChapter      Seven - The Mattel Corgi Sales 1989 - 1995\nFrom      December 1989, following the management consortium’s sale of Corgi Toys      Limited to the US based toy company Mattel, the die-cast operation was allowed      to continue as an independent unit under the banner of Corgi Sales Ltd.\nMattel’s first James Bond Aston Martin DB5 made in China, used wheels      unlike any used before; they were flat, 16mm in diameter as apposed to the      normal 18mm and made the car look squat, low and clumsy. It is possible that      they were taken from another model awaiting the correct issue to be manufactured.      There was no mention of James Bond on the “blue” box and even      the wording “Aston Martin” was printed on clear plastic and placed      over the name plate on the front of the box.\nBy 1991, Corgi Sales Ltd had agreed their James Bond contract and the James      Bond Aston Martin DB5 (94060) was released as part of a ten vehicle collectors      series. The Packaging was one which had not been used before for 007. It was      a clear plastic case containing a 007 logo badge printed in black and red      on a mirrored finish. The same car was was reissued in 1992 with the logo      badge on the left of the car, the 1991 variant had the badge on the right      hand side.\n1991 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 94060 - scale 1/36 - Badge left\n1992 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 94060 - scale 1/36 - Badge right\nManufactured in China, both models came with 7-spoke wheels and a baddie in      dark brown plastic. Apart from these changes, the car was identical to that      last issued from the Swansea factory.\nTo celebrate the 30th Anniversary of the film Goldfinger, Corgi issued their      current DB5 model as a gold plated limited edition collector’s item.      Released in 1993, a year early, the model sold out before it reached the stores,      very few even appearing on the shelves. Its initial retail price of £19.99      almost doubled within 6 weeks of its launch.\n1993      - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 96445 - scale 1/36 - 30 Th Anniversary      Goldfinger\nCorgi’s original plan had been to provide the car a brass finish, but      due to an early press report stating that the car would be gold-plated, there      was no option other than to face possible legal action.\nIt is rumoured that Corgi had difficulties in the plating process and that      only 5,000 were ever completed, however, with my limited certificate stating      number 067 out of 7,500 produced how true can this be?\nThe packaging was the most superior for some time, including a photograph      of one of the “real” James Bond DB5s of the ‘60s (taken      from the cover of Dave Worrall’s book The Most Famous Car In The World      - the complete history of the James Bond DB5”.\nInterestingly, Dave Worrall also wrote the brief history which appears on      the back of the box too.\nThe only difference between this and the then current model was that both      Bond and the baddie had hand painted hair, face & hands.\nThe James Bond Aston Martin DB5 (94060) was re-issued again in 1994. It was      identical to the 30th Anniversary model, less the gold, and retailed for £6.99.\n1994      - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 94060 - scale 1/36 - with snow diorama\nThe box featured a film strip artwork with the Q gadget operations displayed      in each frame. The interior artwork depicted a mountain scene as a back drop      to the model, reminiscent of Bonds journey tailing Goldfinger through the      Alps in the 1964 film.\nThe back of the box continued with more frame by frame instructions and for      the first time on a 007 Corgi, an actual picture of the car from the film.\n \n \nChapter      Eight - The Corgi Classics 1995 - 2008\nIn      August 1995 Corgi management bought back its independence from Mattel and      Corgi Classics Limited was formed. Corgi Classics successfully created a brand      that managed to establish itself as the market leader in the adult die-cast      collectable market.\nIn January 1995 it was announced that in the next James Bond film, GoldenEye,      Bond would be reunited with his Aston Martin from Goldfinger. Cue a new Corgi      variant! Released as part of the Corgi Classics range, the new Aston Martin      DB5 (96657) was simply the current model repackaged in a window box featuring      GoldenEye with Pierce Brosnan as Bond taken from an early film teaser poster.      For some reason, however, Corgi printed this picture of Brosnan in reverse!\n1995 - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 96657 - scale      1/36\nThe prototype box carried Mattel’s name, which was later changed as      when the car was eventually released in December 1995, Corgi were no longer      part of Mattel.\n1995 was a bumper year for Bond and Corgi fans alike, as not only did they      have the DB5 back on the screen but Corgi also decided to reintroduce the      original 1:43 scale model as a limited edition in two versions.\nThe James Bond Aston Martin DB5 (96655) was available in silver, just the      same as its 1968 counterpart, complete with tyre slashers and revolving number      plates. The detail is good, but not quite as crisp as the 1968 version, the      door line mouldings for instance stop short of the top of the door, unlike      the original. It has real rubber tyres but does not have the words “Corgi      Toys” moulded into them. The front number plate housing is larger than      the original and the rear light cluster is painted red, amber & white      while the original’s were all red. The base of the car has the words “Made in China” embossed and is silver and not grey as on the      original.\n1995      - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 96655 - scale 1/43\nThe secret instructions were reproduced and contained within a reproduction      envelope just as back in 1968 although they are printed in silver and not      red. With the instructions was found a spare baddie but no number plate stickers      this time. The number plates were already in place but unlike the 1968 edition,      these have remained faithful to the film. The box containing the car was even      similar in style to the 1973 issue. The issue was limited to 29,000 pieces      world wide and retailed for £19.99 when launched in December 1995. My      model pictured above is model number 14,622 of 29,000.\nThe James Bond Aston Martin DB5 (96656) was the second special edition released      in December 1995, as a gold plated version of the silver 96655. It came mounted      on a plastic plinth and within a clear plastic display box.\n1995      - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 96656 - scale 1/43 - Gold plated\nThis issue was limited to a production run of 19,000 world wide and retailed      for £24.99 when launched in December 1995. My model pictured left is      model number 12,641 of 19,000.\nIn 1997 Corgi created a James Bond Collection 007 set of models and the DB5      was included. The Aston      Martin DB5 & Oddjob (04201) model was 1:43 scale from the same mould      as the 1995 models but was painted in metallic gold similar to the 1965 original      rather than the gold plate of later limited editions. The DB5 is accompanied      in the collectors box by a 54mm white metal figure of Oddjob, Bond’s      adversary from the film Goldfinger.\nIn 1999 Corgi Classics returned with two releases, these were basically re-release      of the 1995 1:36 standard silver model and the 1:43 gold plated special edition.      The 1:36 James Bond Aston Martin DB5 was packaged in black and red with as      in 1995 a picture of Brosnan as Bond but this time facing the correct way.\nThe 1:43 James Bond Aston Martin DB5 (04202) was released for the 35th Anniversary      of Goldfinger, and limited to 6,900 pieces. This differed slightly from the      the earlier version, with the outer packaging being green/white/gold and the      rear tyre slashers were in black plastic and the baddie was dressed in brown      rather than his original blue suit.\n1999 - Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 4202 - scale      1/43 - 35 Th Anniversary Goldfinger\nThe gold plate 40th Anniversary      Edition (CC004307) was released by Corgi in 2005. 12,000 1:36 scale pieces      were produced.\nSharing the same detailed diecast mould as the gold variant, Corgi produced      a silver model as a special edition for Marks & Spencer. This model was      released in a clear plastic display case, similar to that used by Matel in      1991/92, but replacing the badge of that era with a 007 leather key ring.\nIn 2007 Corgi released the Directors Cut versions of the Thunderball and Casino      Royale DB5 models and the Sean Connery Limited Edition Era Set. This latter      box set included a 1:36 scale Aston Martin DB5 and the Rolls Royce III Sedance      de Ville from the film Goldfinger. Only 1,500 sets were produced worldwide      and are a valuable addition to anyone’s collection.\n \n1999 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 04303 - scale 1/36\n \n2002 -      Corgi James Bond D.B. 5 - N° 04303 - scale 1/36\nBritish Association of Toy Retailers 50th Anniversary\nPresented at the BATR Dinner in January 2000\n \n \nChapter      NINE - The Hornby Years 2008\nOn      1st May 2008 Hornby Plc, the international models and collectibles group,      acquired Corgi Classics, agreeing to buy the brand, tooling, and intellectual      property rights from Corgi International Limited, for £7.5 million.\nHornby planned to build on Corgi's core market of adult male collectors in      Britain and attract younger and more international customers.\nTo celebrate the release of the 22nd James Bond film, in November 2008, Hornby      launched its 007 Quantum of Solace Scalextric set, appealing to fans both      young and old. The new set contained the stunning, Aston Martin DBS V12 Bond      car, ahead of the sleek Alfa Romeo 159 in hot pursuit.\nIn      June 2009, having secured the licensing to continue production of the James      Bond models, Corgi released two separate series, the 1:36 scale and the ‘fit      the box’. Each having their own section in the July - December 2009      catalogue they featured the most popular vehicles from the James Bond films.\nThe ‘fit the box’ series, each with a size of around 4 inches,      comprised a rerelease in June 2009 of 10 vehicles in a blister pack for £4.99      and a film canister set containing 8 of the 10 models, first released in 2005,      costing in 2009 a penny shy of £40. The addition to the set was the      Quantum of Solace Aston Martin DBS, TY 96702, which having been retooled from      the Casino Royale DBS, did not arrive in shops until the October.\nThe 1:36 scale complement of 13 models, including the two Aston Martin DB5      variants from Goldfinger CC      04306 and Casino Royale      CC 04309 , and 4 James Bond Limited Edition Era sets were also scheduled      for release in June. Because the Aston Martin DBS, CC 03802, was to receive      a completely new and highly detailed interior and seated bond figure, this      model did not arrive in stores until early December, but just in time for      Christmas!\nThe 4 James Bond Limited Edition Era sets first seen in 2005, centred on the      popular James Bond actors, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan and,      most recently and new to this collection, Daniel Craig. Each limited edition      set came with 2 cars most representative of the movies in which they starred      and with a hefty price tag of £34.99.\nIn these Era sets, Corgi included a set of 4 miniature movie posters in place      of the movie booklets which accompanied the 2005 releases. Oddly, rather than      the catalogue picturing the Casino Royal version of the DB5 for inclusion      in the Daniel Craig set, Corgi paired the Quantum of Solace retooled DBS with      the Gold Finger DB5 as included with the Sean Connery set; this was however,      corrected on release of the actual models.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\n... new James Bond film ...
