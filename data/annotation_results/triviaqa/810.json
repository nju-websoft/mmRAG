In 2016, ESA will provide the Trace Gas Orbiter to study the atmosphere of Mars to measure its chemical composition, as well as an  entry, descent and landing demonstrator module.\nFor the 2018 mission, ESA will provide the carrier and the ExoMars rover , which will search for signs that life on Mars existed in the past or present, collecting samples from as deep as 6.5 feet (2 meters) beneath the surface of the Red Planet.\n\"It will be the first Mars rover able to drill to depths of 2 m, collecting samples that have been shielded from the harsh conditions of the surface, where radiation and oxidants can destroy organic materials,\" ESA officials said in a statement.\nExoMars rover\nCredit: ESA\nRoscosmos, meanwhile, will supply the rockets to launch both Mars missions, as well as the 2018 descent module and surface platform. Both space agencies will provide scientific instruments and will work together on the scientific goals of the missions, according to ESA officials.\nESA director-general Jean-Jacques Dordain called Thursday's agreement a \"momentous occasion\" for the ExoMars program after meeting with the head of Roscosmos, Vladimir Popovkin, at the ESA headquarters in Paris. Dordain said in a statement that the agreement \"will demonstrate the competitiveness of European industry, be important for preparing a solid participation of ESA in future international exploration missions and address the key question of whether life ever arose on Mars.\"\nNASA pulled out of the ExoMars program last year due to budget cuts in its planetary science program, but ESA officials said the U.S. space agency will still contribute some communications and engineering support for the new Mars missions.\nFollow SPACE.com on Twitter  @Spacedotcom .

What is ESA? Ariane-5 ECA launch ... ESA's headquarters are in Paris which ... What is ESA? - European Space Agency What is ESA? / Welcome to ESA / About Us / ESA\nWhat is ESA?\nAriane-5 ECA launch\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) is Europe’s gateway to space. Its mission is to shape the development of Europe’s space capability and ensure that investment in space continues to deliver benefits to the citizens of Europe and the world.\nESA is an international organisation with 22 Member States. By coordinating the financial and intellectual resources of its members, it can undertake programmes and activities far beyond the scope of any single European country.\nWhat does ESA do?\nESA’s job is to draw up the European space programme and carry it through. ESA's programmes are designed to find out more about Earth, its immediate space environment, our Solar System and the Universe, as well as to develop satellite-based technologies and services, and to promote European industries. ESA also works closely with space organisations outside Europe.\nWho belongs to ESA?\nAustria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Slovenia is an Associate Member. Canada takes part in some projects under a cooperation agreement.\nBulgaria, Cyprus, Malta, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia have cooperation agreements with ESA. Discussions are under way with Croatia.\nParis, France - MERIS, 14 July 2003\nWhere is ESA located?\nESA's headquarters are in Paris which is where policies and programmes are decided. ESA also has sites in a number of European countries, each of which has different responsibilities:\nEAC , the European Astronauts Centre in Cologne, Germany;\nESAC , the European Space Astronomy Centre, in Villanueva de la Canada, Madrid, Spain;\nESOC , the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany;\nESRIN , the ESA centre for Earth Observation, in Frascati, near Rome, Italy;\nESTEC , the European Space Research and Technology Centre, Noordwijk, the Netherlands.\nECSAT , the European Centre for Space Applications and Telecommunications, Harwell, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom.\nESA also has liaison offices in Belgium, USA and Russia; a launch base in French Guiana and ground/tracking stations in various parts of the world.\nHow many people work for ESA?\nThere are around 2200 staff working for ESA, from all the Member States and include scientists, engineers, information technology specialists and administrative personnel.\nWhere do ESA’s funds come from?\nESA’s mandatory activities (space science programmes and the general budget) are funded by a financial contribution from all the Agency’s Member States, calculated in accordance with each country’s gross national product. In addition, ESA conducts a number of optional programmes. Each Member State decides in which optional programme they wish to participate and the amount they wish to contribute.\nHow big is ESA’s budget?\nESA's budget for 2012 is €4020 million. ESA operates on the basis of geographical return, i.e. it invests in each Member State, through industrial contracts for space programmes, an amount more or less equivalent to each country’s contribution.\nHow much does each European spend on ESA?\nEuropean per capita investment in space is very little. On average, every citizen of an ESA Member State pays, in taxes for expenditure on space, about the same as the price of a cinema ticket (in USA, investment in civilian space activities is almost four times as much).\nHow does ESA operate?\nThe Council is ESA's governing body and provides the basic policy guidelines within which ESA develops the European space programme. Each Member State is represented on the Council and has one vote, regardless of its size or financial contribution.\nESA is headed by a Director General who is elected by the Council every four years. Each individual research sector has its own Directorate and reports directly to the Director General. The present Director General of ESA is Jan Woerner.\nFor more information:\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nEurope May Work With China on Space Station. ... [the Chinese space station program],\" Chesson said. ... at ESA's Parisian headquarters. Europe Prepares to Cooperate With China on Space Station Europe Prepares to Cooperate With China on Space Station\nEurope May Work With China on Space Station\nBy Rob Coppinger, SPACE.com Contributor |\nFebruary 26, 2013 12:00pm ET\nMORE\nThis artist's illustration from a China space agency video shows the Tiangong 1 space laboratory, a prototype module for the country's planned space station.\nCredit: China Manned Space Engineering Office\nChina aims to establish a large manned space station within the next decade, officials have said, and the latest reports suggest that this outpost could host not only Chinese astronauts, but European spaceflyers as well.\nA plan is afoot for China and Europe to cooperate on the venture, which might see the European Space Agency (ESA) building technologies, including a rendezvous and docking system, for the station, in exchange for opportunities for its astronauts to visit the facility.\nChina plans to have the space station running by 2020. Both the station and China's manned spacecraft Shenzhou could use ESA's International Berthing and Docking Mechanism (IBDM), because of a problem with the Russian system the Chinese have been using until now.\nChina's Shenzhou and Tiangong-1 space laboratory , a test module already in orbit, use a modified version of Russia's Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS).  APAS was developed for the 1975 Apollo Soyuz Test Project and is used on the International Space Station (ISS). [ How China's First Space Station Will Work (Infographic) ]\nBouncing off\nAn unmanned Shenzhou spacecraft docked with Tiangong-1 for the first time in November 2011, and the docking mechanism didn't work exactly as planned, some say.\n \"It was originally bouncing off,\" Bob Chesson, an ESA human spaceflight advisor, told SPACE.com. \"Essentially they have to ram this [Shenzhou] thing in and they are very worried that if you assemble a station like that, you basically will have all sorts of structure fracture mechanics problems, that type of thing.\"\nThe Shenzhou spacecraft is not heavy enough to activate the APAS docking system correctly, Chesson said, so it had to be rammed forcefully to make a connection.\nChesson traveled to Beijing with ESA's director-general Jean-Jacques Dordain and talked with the China Manned Space Engineering Office.\n\"Our director general has made some noises that he wants us to get involved with [the Chinese space station program ],\" Chesson said. \"The Chinese, we had them over and showed them [the IBDM] and they were very interested because they are using the modified APAS system.\"\nTo discuss whether the IBDM system might work better for the Chinese space station, ESA officials sponsored a working seminar to collaborate with Chinese space officials, Chesson said.\nChesson has been a senior advisor to Thomas Reiter, the German-born former astronaut and head of ESA's human spaceflight directorate and operations. He spoke recently about the collaboration with China during a presentation to the Cambridge branch of the UK's Royal Aeronautical Society.\nDocking basics\nVideo still showing China's Shenzhou 8 spacecraft docked with the Tiangong 1 lab module on Nov. 3, 2011.\nCredit: China Central Television\nThe IBDM is system to allow different countries' spacecraft to dock and berth with each other, despite their different designs.\nOriginally developed by ESA and NASA for the X-38 program , a prototype crewed spaceplane that was cancelled in 2002. The X-38, also known as the Crew Rescue Vehicle (CRV), would have allowed a seven-person International Space Station crew to escape the station.\nThe US space agency ended its involvement in IBDM when the X-38 program ended. Now IBDM will form part of the ESA-China cooperation, as rendezvous and docking is one of three working groups set up by Chesson for collaboration between the two agencies. The other two working groups focus on crew training and the exchange of payload facilities and experiments.\n\"Last November we had a delegation from the Chinese astronaut training center, they came over for a week at EAC [European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany] and we explained to them how our training program works,\" Chesson said.\nThat visit was preceded on Oct. 8, 2012 by the China Manned Space Agency's director general Wang Zhaoyao and the first Chinese female astronaut, Liu Yang, visiting Dordain, at ESA's Parisian headquarters. Yang was involved in the 2012 Shenzhou-9 mission that docked with Tiangong-1.\nFollowing these two visits, a delegation of ESA astronauts and trainers will be going to Beijing in April to see how the Chinese train their crews, Chesson said.\nLearning Chinese\nA Chinese Long March 2F rocket launches on the Shenzhou 9 mission, China's first manned space docking flight and first flight of a female astronaut, on June 16, 2012 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.\nCredit: China Academy of Launch Technology\nWith this growing relationship, ESA now offers introductory Chinese classes for its astronauts at the EAC.\nFrank De Winne , a Belgian-born astronaut and head of ESA's astronaut corps, confirmed to SPACE.com that an astronaut exchange program was ongoing. But:  \"No discussion has taken place as to a potential flight by a European astronaut on a specific Shenzhou capsule,\" he said.\nJoint astronaut training, Chinese lessons and Chesson's third working group, the exchange of payload facilities and experiments, all point to preparations for future missions for ESA crew on China's spacecraft. Chesson said that ESA is \"seriously looking\" at providing experiments for future Tiangong missions.\nDe Winne told SPACE.com that European experiments on a Tiangong mission or the future Chinese space station will \"depend on the ESA member states' decision as well as the Chinese disposition.\"\nThe exchange of experiments could conceivably lead to Chinese science being carried out on the International Space Station by ESA astronauts. \"For the moment, there are no specific experiments that have been identified,\" and any Chinese experiment on ISS \"would have to first be discussed with the ISS partners,\" De Winne explained.\nESA has a history of cooperating with China on Earth observation since the 1990s and, more recently, under the Dragon programs — joint ESA-China programs for Earth observation that have been ongoing since 2004.\nWhile ESA is forging ahead with Chinese cooperation, NASA is prohibited from engaging in bilateral cooperative activities with China or any Chinese owned companies, per a directive from Congress.\n\n"
