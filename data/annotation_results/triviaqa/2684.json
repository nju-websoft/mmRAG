King George V Biography (Royalty/World War I Figure) King George V Biography (Royalty/World War I Figure)\nBest known as: The King of England during World War I\nName at birth: George Frederick Ernest Albert\nEngland's George V was the king of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1910 until 1935, a span that included World War I (1914-18).  A naval officer who had seen the reaches of the British empire firsthand, George became heir to the throne when his older brother Edward died in 1892.  Upon the death of his father Edward VII , George assumed the throne on 6 May 1910.  King George V's reign was marked by several important events, including the Union of South Africa (1910), Ireland's Sinn Fein Rebellion (1916), World War I and labor unrest that led to the General Strike of 1926.  Not known for his intellect or education, George V was popular with the public for his ordinary lifestyle, and during the Great War the king earned a reputation for steadiness and a commitment to duty.  He famously refused asylum to his Romanov cousin, Nicholas II , after the 1917 Russian Revolution (Nicholas and his family were executed in 1918). To distance himself from his German heritage, George changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor, and the House of Hanover became the House of Windsor.  George and his wife May (known as Mary) had one daughter and five sons, including his successor, Edward VIII and Edward's successor, George VI .\nExtra credit: King George V was seriously injured during a trip to France during World War I when his horse fell on him and broke his pelvis...

Public respect for the king increased during World War ... BBC - History - George V BBC - History - George V\nz\nGeorge V     © George V embodied diligence and duty and sought to represent his subjects, rather than define government policy, as his predecessors Victoria and Edward had.\nGeorge was born on 3 June 1865 in London, the second son of the Prince of Wales. When George was 18 he went into the Royal Navy, but the death of his elder brother in 1892 meant he had to leave a career he enjoyed, as he was now heir to the throne. He married his elder brother's fiancée, Princess Mary of Teck, and they had six children. In 1901, George's father became king and in May 1910, George himself became king. His reign began amid a constitutional crisis over the government's attempt to curb the power of the House of Lords. After the Liberal government obtained the king's promise to create sufficient peers to overcome Conservative opposition in the Lords (and won a second election in 1910), the Parliament Bill was passed by the Lords in 1911 without a mass creation of peers. 1911 also saw George's visit to India, the only king-emperor to make the journey.\nPublic respect for the king increased during World War One, when he made many visits to the front line, hospitals, factories and dockyards. In 1917 anti-German feeling led him to adopt the family name of Windsor, replacing the Germanic Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\nAfter the overthrow of the Russian Tsar in 1917, the post-war world saw the toppling of monarchies all over Europe, many of them related to the British royal family. The king's relationship with parts of the British Empire changed too. The 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and subsequent civil war resulted in the setting up of the Irish Free State in 1922, which became a dominion, while the six northern counties remained part of the United Kingdom. The Statute of Westminster of 1931 meant dominion parliaments could now pass laws without reference to United Kingdom laws. This paradoxically increased the monarchy's importance, since the dominions (no longer subordinated to one supreme parliament at Westminster) were now linked through common allegiance to the crown. India gained a measure of self-governance in 1935.\nIn 1924, George readily accepted the first Labour government. In 1931 the international economic slump caused a political crisis in Britain. The king promoted the idea of a  'national coalition' government of Labour, Conservatives and Liberals, which was eventually formed.\nIn 1935, the king celebrated his Silver Jubilee, an occasion of great public rejoicing.  He died on 20 January 1936 and was succeeded by his son Edward.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nGeorge V was the King of England for the duration of World War I. ...

He was the grandson of Queen Victoria and a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm III and Tsar Nicholas II.\nFull Answer\nGeorge V had German relatives on both sides, and he and many others in his family held German noble titles. In 1917, at the height of World War I, George V ruled that the British royal family would give up all its German titles. To compensate some of his male relatives, he styled them as British peers with new British titles. In addition, he changed the name of the British royal family from the German House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nKing George V of Great Britain ...

Trenches on the Web - Bio: King George V of Great Britain and Ireland\nKing George V of Great Britain and Ireland\nMelissa Sogegian\n1865-1936\nGeneral Information\nGeorge Frederick Ernest Albert, better known as King George V, was the king of Britain during World War I.  He was born in 1865 as second son of King Edward VII and the grandson of Queen Victoria.  From the early age of 12, he was trained for a career in the Royal Navy, eventually rising to the rank of Commander. His older brother died and he gained heir to the throne.  At the age of 26, he had already acquired personal knowledge of outlying British lands that he had learned in the Royal Navy.\nIn 1893 he married the daughter of the Duke of Teck; Mary.  Together they had five children who held court:  King Edward VIII; Albert, Duke of York, later King George VI (upon Edward's abdication); the Duke of Gloucester; the Duke of Kent; and Mary,  Countess of Harewood.\nIt was he who changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor.  In 1917, during World War I, he gave up the royal family's connections to all things German including titles.    In 1911, George traveled to India for a ceremony to cement ties with that colony.  May of 1935 was celebrated as the silver jubilee of his reign.  He died on 20-Jan-1936. He was succeeded to the throne by his son, Edward VIII.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\n... during the third year of World War I, Britain’s King George V orders the British ... on June 19, 1917, the king decreed that the royal ...

The following year, George married the German princess Mary of Teck (his cousin, a granddaughter of King George III), who had previously been intended for Edward. The couple had six children, including the future Edward VIII and George VI (who took the throne in 1936 after his brother abdicated to marry the American divorcee Wallis Simpson). As the new Duke of York, George was made to abandon his career in the navy; he became a member of the House of Lords and received a political education. When his father died in 1910, George ascended to the British throne as King George V.\nWith the outbreak of World War I in the summer of 1914, strong anti-German feeling within Britain caused sensitivity among the royal family about its German roots. Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, also a grandson of Queen Victoria, was the king’s cousin; the queen herself was German. As a result, on June 19, 1917, the king decreed that the royal surname was thereby changed from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor.\nIn order to demonstrate further solidarity with the British war effort, George made several visits to survey the troops at the Western Front. During one visit to France in 1915, he fell off a horse and broke his pelvis, an injury that plagued him for the rest of his life. Also in 1917, he made the controversial decision to deny asylum in Britain to another of his cousins, Czar Nicholas II of Russia, and his family, after the czar abdicated during the Russian Revolution. Czar Nicholas, his wife Alexandra and their children were subsequently arrested and later murdered by the Bolsheviks.\nRelated Videos\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\nRevealed: how King George V demanded Britain enter the First World War Record of previously unknown meeting between George V and his Foreign Secretary ...

It lasted for one and a half hours,” Sir Cecil wrote.\n“He told me that Uncle Edward had said that he could not possibly see what justifiable reason we could find for going to war.\n“HM said in reply, ‘You have got to find a reason, Grey.’”\nClick here to see a full version of the letter\nThe King told Grey \"that, if we didn’t go to war, Germany would mop up France and having dealt with the European situation would proceed to obtain complete domination of this country.\n“For that reason,\" Sir Ceci wrote, \"he felt that it was absolutely essential that whatever happened we had got to find a reason for entering the War at once…\n“The next day he had a private letter from Poincaré [the French President] urging our participation in the War, and almost at the same time a telegram arrived from King Albert [of Belgium] about the violation of Belgium.\n“He sent this straight across to Uncle Edward with a note to the effect that here was the reason and there was no need for him to try and think of anything.”\nThe envelope that Adrian Graves discovered among his grandfather's records\nOn August 3, shortly after receiving the King’s note, Sir Edward gave a speech to Parliament in which he said “it is clear that the peace of Europe cannot be preserved”.\nHe returned to his room in the Foreign Office and made the now famous remark as he watched the lamps being lit outside: “The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.”\nThe following day, when the chimes of Big Ben rang out at 11pm, Britain was at war.\nThe letter was unearthed by Sir Edward’s great-great-nephew and grandson of Sir Cecil, Adrian Graves.\nMr Graves inherited Sir Cecil’s papers, which he kept in their original Asprey case alongside his fishing tackle, but had never studied them.\n“My grandfather was involved in the First World War – he was one of the first to be captured, at the Battle of Mons, and later awarded the Military Cross. The case contained some of his records and papers relating to the war and his captivity.\n“I decided to look through them as the centenary of August 4 was coming up, and I came across an envelope. Written on the front were the words, ‘Interview with King’. I had never known it was there,” Mr Graves said.\nAmong the heirlooms passed down to Mr Graves is Sir Edward’s gold pocket watch. It has no glass cover because the Foreign Secretary had failing eyesight and could tell the time only by touching the face.\nMr Graves said: “I hold it and think: was my great-great-uncle feeling the hands as they approached 11pm and realising that war was almost upon us?”\nThe pocket watch belonging to Sir Edward Grey, Foreign Secretary during the First World War\nAt the time of the meeting with George V, Britain’s Cabinet remained divided over whether Britain should go to war.\nProf Hew Strachan, military historian and author of the recent The First World War: A New History, said: “It is clear that the King took a more active role in thinking about the country’s foreign policy than most conventional accounts allow for.\n“If Grey said these things, it was in order to make clear to the King that the Government was not yet in a position to support France. Belgium provided everybody with the way in.\n“The letter stresses the thrust of Grey’s policy: the need to be firm with Germany while not encouraging the French and Russians to rush into war. Grey wants a diplomatic deal.”\nProf David Reynolds of Cambridge University, author of The Long Shadow: The Great War and the 20th Century, said: “What we are hearing here, if this is a true rendition of events nearly 20 years before, is a weary Grey airing his worries in private on August 2.\n“The document also reminds us that George V, although always conscious of his place as a constitutional monarch, was a king who privately offered strong views to his ministers and that those views were taken seriously.\n“From this document, we do learn something about Grey but we learn rather more about George V.”\nSir Edward’s remark about the lamps going out is the inspiration for the Lights Out project, which is urging every household in Britain to turn out the lights at 11pm on August 4.\nHis role in the conflict will be examined in a BBC Parliament programme, To War, broadcast on August 3 at 8pm.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 8:\n\nListen to the official BBC recording of the King's speech at the outbreak of World War ... of World War II.

He was christened Albert after his great-grandfather, Prince Albert. In 1909, went to Dartmouth Naval College and joined the Royal Navy - seeing action in the World War One Battle of Jutland - and then the Royal Air Force. In 1920, he was created Duke of York and began to take on royal duties. In 1923, he married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, youngest daughter of the 14th Earl of Strathmore. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret.\nFollowing the abdication of his elder brother, Edward VIII, George was proclaimed king on 12 December 1936 and crowned in May the following year. He and the queen paid state visits to France in 1938, and to Canada and the United States in 1939, making George the first British monarch to enter the US. George supported Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement towards Germany and Italy. When Chamberlain resigned in May 1940, the king wished to replace him with Lord Halifax, but was persuaded to accept Winston Churchill, whose wartime leadership he then supported unreservedly.\nDuring the war George visited Allied armies on several battle fronts and toured the home front extensively. He also created the George Cross for 'acts of the greatest heroism or of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme danger' - an award for courage for acts not carried out under fire from an enemy. The Royal family's refusal to leave Britain during the conflict and their active involvement in the war effort won them many admirers.\nAlthough his symbolic leadership in Britain was crucial during World War Two, George's reign was perhaps most important for the accelerating evolution of the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations and the post-war transformation of Great Britain into a welfare state. His hereditary title of Emperor of India ceased in 1947 when India and Pakistan became separate independent countries. From 1948, his health deteriorated, and he died on 6 February 1952, a few months after undergoing an operation for lung cancer. His elder daughter Elizabeth succeeded him as monarch.\n\n"
