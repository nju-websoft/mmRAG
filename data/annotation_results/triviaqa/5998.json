In addition to vocabulary, you will learn the order of the days. Take note that in Spanish the week starts with Monday rather than Sunday.\nWhat Are the Days of the Week in Spanish?\nWhat a special treat. Today we're going to peek inside Ms. Silva's kindergarten class as they learn the days of the week.\n-Buenos días clase!\n-Buenos días señorita Silva!\n-Ok, clase. 7 días de la semana. Cuál es el primer día de la semana? Marco? (Ok, class. 7 days of the week. What is the first day of the week? Marco?)\n-Lunes.\n-Bien! Lunes. Luego? (Good! Monday. Then?)\n-Martes.\n-Excelente! Lunes, martes… todos? (Excellent! Monday, Tuesday... is that all?)\n-Miércoles, jueves, viernes, sábado y domingo.\nMiércoles (mee-EHR-koh-lehs) means Wednesday. Jueves (hoo-EH-vehs) means Thursday. Viernes (vee-EHR-nehs) means Friday. Sábado (SAH-bah-doh) means Saturday. And domingo (doh-MEEN-goh) means Sunday.\nNursery Rhyme for Days of the Week\nMuy bien! Now do we all remember our special song to sing the days of the week? Let's sing it together!\nLunes, martes, miércoles, jueves, viernes, sábado y domingo; lunes, martes, miércoles, jueves, viernes, sábado y domingo.\n(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday; Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.)\nMuy bien clase!\nFavorite Days of the Week\n-Marco, cuál es tu día favorito de la semana? (Marco, what is your favorite day of the week?)\n-Mi día favorito es sábado y también domingo. (My favorite day is Saturday, and also Sunday.)\n-Sí? Y por qué? (Yes? And why is that?)\n-Porque estoy en casa, y no en la escuela! (Because I'm at home and not in school!)\n-Es verdad, Marco. Hay cinco días en la escuela y dos en casa. Estamos en la escuela los lunes, martes, miércoles, jueves y viernes. Y estamos en casa los sábados y domingos.\n(It's true, Marco. There are five days at school and two at home. We are at school each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. And we are at home on Saturday and Sunday.)\n×\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nSpanish days of the week vocabulary lesson. The purpose of this post is to give you many interesting ways to learn the days ... The Spanish word for Tuesday is martes. Learn Spanish : Spanish Days of the Week Spanish days of the week\nSpain and the Spanish language\nSpanish days of the week\nPosted in Words\nSpanish days of the week vocabulary lesson\nThe purpose of this post is to give you many interesting ways to learn the days of the week in Spanish, which goes beyond a normal online free Spanish page.\nThe first way I will help you learn the Spanish days of the week are with link words. These are memory aides that help you remember words through associations.\nThen I will give you a short quiz. I believe the most important thing to learn Spanish is to get to a critical level of vocabulary. I think the best way to learn this is through testing and retesting.  I teach and study languages and I know what I am talking about, for your brain to remember something you need to quiz and test yourself.\nLast, I give you some interesting extra facts about the days of the week in Spanish. So I hope this post will be of value to you.\nSpanish days of the week with pronunciation and mnemonics:\nThe Spanish word for Sunday is domingo. The pronunciation is: doe-min-go. To remember that Spanish word for Sunday image that you play ‘dominos’ after church on Sunday with a Spanish priest.\nThe Spanish word for Monday in Spanish is lunes. The pronunciation is: lou-ness. Imagine your driving to work on Monday morning and there are only ‘lunatics’ on the road.\nThe Spanish word for Tuesday is martes. The pronunciation is: mar-tess. On Tuesday you are the ‘smartess’ as you are rested from the weekend but its not Monday.\nThe Spanish word for Wednesday is miércoles.\nThe pronunciation is: mee-air-couless. Imagine ‘air cools less’ on Wednesday because it is the middle of the week and a long way until the weekend.\nThe Spanish word for Thursday is jueves\nThe pronunciation is: whey-vess. Imagine you ‘weigh less’ on Thursday as you have been working out all week.\nThe Spanish word for Friday is viernes.\nThe pronunciation is: vee-air-ness. Imagine you meet the ‘heiress’ with a great fortune so you can plan a trip to Madrid or Mexico for the weekend.\nThe Spanish word for Saturday is sábado.\nThe pronunciation is: saa-ba-doe. This is like the word Sabbath.\nSpanish days of the week\nVocabulary Quiz\nTest your ability to jettison your English Spanish dictionary when it come to Spanish days of the week with my quiz.  Do it until you get 100% a couple of time times as this is a relatively short list.  If you have trouble remembering the word with the above mnemonics try to visualize the word or spell the word in the air with your finger.\nSunday\nSaturday\nFirst day of the week in Spain and Mexico\nThe first day of the week in Spain is actually Monday, the first day of the week in Mexico, Puerto Rico and other Latin American or Hispanic areas is Sunday as it is in the US.  For me when I moved to Europe this was confusing a bit.  On one hand the Europeans and Spanish are correct, Monday is the first day of the week as we all go to work on this day. Yet on the other hand, Spain being a Catholic country, should see the last day as the day God rested, that is one Saturday and Sunday being the start of something new.  But it does not really matter as each culture has a different day. Spanish weekdays are Monday though Friday, that is all you have to know.\nAbbreviations for the days of the week in Spanish\nMonday is Lu\nLast list of Spanish days of the week that is less common is single letter abbreviations:\nD L M M J V S\nThis is useful if you are using any software like outlook or calendar with only abbreviations, maybe its more useful for than the actual vocabulary.\nSpanish days\nThe above image is just for fun as it has the same title as this is a famous Spanish American post card.\nI am trying to create a valuable resource to help people learn Spanish online for free bit by bit. I want to teach it  in small lessons with out some great hardcore program, rather light and interesting lessons on vocabulary and language.  If you have any ideas about the Spanish language or suggestions please let me know, including the days of the week in Spanish.\nLeave a reply to Spanish days of the week\nName (required)\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nTuesday. . .martes Wednesday. . . ...
