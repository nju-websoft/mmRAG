After Pres. Warren G. Harding transferred supervision of the naval oil-reserve lands from the navy to the Department of the Interior in 1921, Fall secretly granted to Harry F. Sinclair of the Mammoth Oil Company exclusive rights to the Teapot Dome (Wyoming) reserves (April 7, 1922). He granted similar rights to Edward L. Doheny of Pan American Petroleum Company for the Elk Hills and Buena Vista Hills reserves in California (1921–22).\nA 1924 cartoon depicting Washington officials racing down an oil-slicked road to the White House, …\nThe Granger Collection, New York\nAlbert Bacon Fall.\nHarris & Ewing Collection/Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (Digital File Number: LC-DIG-hec-17141)\nWhen these leases and contracts came under investigation by committees of the U.S. Senate, it was disclosed that shortly after the signing of the Teapot Dome lease, Fall and members of his family had received from an unknown source more than $200,000 in Liberty bonds under circumstances indicating that the bonds came from a company organized by Sinclair and others receiving benefits from the lease. Also, it appeared that prior to the execution of the Pan American contracts and leases, Doheny, at Fall’s request, sent $100,000 in currency to Fall as a “loan” that had not been repaid.\nWhen the affair became known, Congress directed President Harding to cancel the leases; the Supreme Court declared the leases fraudulent and ruled illegal Harding’s transfer of authority to Fall. Although the president himself was not implicated in the transactions that had followed the transfer, the revelations of his associates’ misconduct took a severe toll on his health; disillusioned and exhausted, he died before the full extent of the wrongdoing had been determined. Fall was convicted of accepting a bribe in the Elk Hills negotiations and imprisoned. Doheny and Sinclair were acquitted of charges of bribery and criminal conspiracy , but Sinclair spent 6 1/2 months in prison for contempt of court and contempt of the U.S. Senate. Although the secretary of the navy, Edwin Denby, had signed all the leases, he was cleared of all charges. While “Teapot Dome” entered the American political vocabulary as a synonym for governmental corruption, the scandal had little long-term effect on the Republican Party . Calvin Coolidge , a Republican , was elected president in 1924.\nPolitical cartoon depicting the Teapot Dome Scandal of the early 1920s.\nJT Vintage/age fotostock\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nGraft and Oil: How Teapot Dome Became the Greatest Political Scandal of Its ...

Cherny\nIn the 1920s, Teapot Dome became synonymous with government corruption and the scandals arising out of the administration of President Warren G. Harding. Since then, it has sometimes been used to symbolize the power and influence of oil companies in American politics. In the days before Watergate, one historian called it “the greatest and most sensational scandal in the history of American politics.”\nTeapot Dome is a geological feature in Wyoming, named for nearby Teapot Rock, and the site of an oil field. In 1915, President Woodrow Wilson designated that oil deposit as Naval Oil Reserve Number 3 (reserves Number 1 and Number 2, in Elk Hills and Buena Vista Hills, California, respectively, had been similarly identified by President William Howard Taft in 1912). These reserves were created to guarantee that the Navy would have a sufficient supply of oil in wartime. However, their establishment was controversial—oil interests believed that the reserves were unnecessary and could be developed privately. In addition, private wells surrounded the naval reserve fields, siphoning off their underground deposits.\nThat was the situation facing Albert Fall, one of President Harding’s poker pals, when Harding appointed him as Secretary of the Interior in 1921. As a lawyer in New Mexico Territory, Fall had represented mining and timber companies and had invested in mining himself. As a US senator from New Mexico after 1912, he’d shown little interest in the conservation movement, and conservationists, led by Harry Slattery and Gifford Pinchot, viewed him as hostile to their ideas. When Fall tried to open Alaska’s oil, coal, and timber to extensive private development, the conservationists were quick to organize and defeat his plans. Similarly, when Fall tried to move the National Forests and federal Forestry Service under his control at the Department of the Interior, the conservationists blocked him. In their efforts, conservationists could count on help from a number of progressives in Congress, notably Senator Robert La Follette, a leader of the progressive wing of the Republican Party.\nStymied in his efforts to acquire more control over western natural resources and make them more easily available to developers, Fall turned to the naval oil reserves. He persuaded Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby and President Harding to transfer the naval oil reserves to the Interior Department. He then secretly, and without competitive bidding, leased the Teapot Dome oil rights to Harry Sinclair’s Mammoth Oil Company and the Elk Hills oil rights to the Pan-American Petroleum Company, owned by Edward Doheny, a longtime friend of Fall’s. When the news became public in April 1922, conservationists and small oil producers in Wyoming, who objected to the secrecy and lack of competitive bidding, raised a storm of protest. La Follette called for a Senate investigation, and the Senate approved the resolution.\nFall argued that his actions were perfectly reasonable and beneficial to the Navy, since the reserves were threatened by privately owned oil wells that were draining the Navy’s oil. Granting a single lease to pump the reserved oil, Fall reasoned, was the most efficient means of saving it. The leases required Sinclair and Doheny to calculate royalties for the oil they pumped from the naval reserves, and use the royalties to construct and fill fuel storage facilities for the Navy in California, Pearl Harbor (Hawaii), and elsewhere. Sinclair was also to construct a pipeline from Wyoming to Kansas City, which would be available for other oil producers as well. Fall claimed that secrecy, and hence no competitive bidding, was necessary because the storage facilities could be targets in a war.\nWhen the Senate opened its investigation, Fall delivered a truckload of documents to the committee, snarling the investigators in a mass of paper. He then resigned from office in January 1923. The investigation, led by Senator Thomas Walsh, Democrat of Montana, with assistance from Slattery, finally got underway in October of that year. Though nothing seemed objectionable in the materials delivered by Fall, Walsh began to dig into reports of improvements to Fall’s ranch. In January 1924, testifying before the committee, Doheny revealed that he had loaned Fall $100,000, and that his son, Edward Doheny Jr., together with his son’s close friend Hugh Plunkett, had delivered the cash to Fall in a satchel. However, Doheny denied that the loan had any connection to the Elk Hills lease. Similarly, Sinclair acknowledged that he’d given Fall some livestock but denied any connection to Teapot Dome. Congress thereupon asked the President to take action to cancel the leases and name special counsel to investigate and prosecute those responsible for any wrongdoing.\nHarding’s sudden death in August 1923 released him from mounting an investigation of his scandal-plagued administration. He had appointed friends such as Fall to high positions in the government where many of them took bribes, embezzled government money, and committed fraud. He died before investigators could determine the full extent of his cronies’ corrupt activities.\nPresident Calvin Coolidge, who had become president when Harding died, announced he would appoint two special prosecutors, one Democrat and one Republican, to take over the investigation. Owen J. Roberts, a prominent lawyer and future Supreme Court Justice, was the Republican; Atlee Pomerene, a former US Senator from Ohio, was the Democrat. Under their leadership, the investigation discovered that one of Sinclair’s companies had transferred $233,000 in Liberty Bonds (bonds issued by the federal government during World War I) to Fall’s son-in-law, and that Sinclair had also contributed substantially to the Republican Party.\nAs the Teapot Dome scandal unfolded, Democrats gleefully planned a 1924 presidential campaign against Republican corruption. Teapot Dome was only the most dramatic example of corruption by Harding’s appointees. Other scandals had emerged in the Veterans Bureau and in the office of the Alien Property Custodian (responsible for the property of Germans and other enemy aliens during World War I). One scandal implicated Harding’s Attorney General, Harry Daugherty. Coolidge, however, provided the Republicans with an image of flinty integrity, and his actions in appointing the special prosecutors, in demanding the resignation of Daugherty and Denby, and in naming the highly regarded Harlan Fiske Stone as Daugherty’s successor seemed to demonstrate that he would not tolerate corruption in his administration and that his standards for Cabinet appointments were much higher than Harding’s had been.\nThe Democrats proved to have oil problems of their own. Doheny was a Democrat who had contributed to the Democratic Party; through his various business enterprises, he had hired a number of prominent Democrats at various times. During the Senate hearings, a Republican Senator led Doheny to reveal that four previous members of Woodrow Wilson’s Cabinet, all important leaders of the Democratic Party, had been on his payroll after leaving public office. Most significantly for the Democrats, Doheny had paid William Gibbs McAdoo $50,000 per year for several years as a legal retainer. McAdoo, the leading Democratic presidential prospect and well known as a progressive, was now tainted by oil money. Though a major problem, Doheny’s money was not the only problem with McAdoo’s campaign, and he failed to secure the nomination. Instead, the Democrats nominated John W. Davis, a conservative lawyer who specialized in representing corporations. As a result, most progressives in both parties supported the third-party candidacy of Robert La Follette. Coolidge won easily. In the end, though both Republicans and Democrats had tried to use Teapot Dome to embarrass their opponents, neither party drew much advantage from the events.\nBy the time Walsh’s investigation finally wound down, he had found only circumstantial evidence against Fall. Roberts and Pomerene, however, found additional evidence and filed a total of eight cases, two civil and six criminal. In 1929, Fall was convicted on charges of accepting a bribe from Doheny—the only guilty verdict in the Teapot Dome case. Fall, the first Cabinet member convicted of a crime committed while in office, was fined $100,000 and sentenced to a year in prison. Doheny, however, was acquitted of offering the same bribe to Fall; both men always insisted that the $100,000 was a loan, and Doheny eventually foreclosed on Fall’s ranch. With Fall now destitute, his fine was excused. After all appeals failed, he arrived at prison in 1931 but was released after nine months due to poor health. In 1929, Doheny’s son was murdered by Plunkett, who then committed suicide; Plunkett may have feared that he’d be sent to prison for helping to deliver the cash to Fall.\nLike Doheny, Sinclair was acquitted of bribing Fall but served several months in prison for contempt of Congress and contempt of court. Doheny and Sinclair remained wealthy and powerful until their deaths. Doheny is memorialized by Doheny State Beach in California, the Doheny Campus of Mount St. Mary’s College in southern California, the Doheny Library (a memorial to his son) at the University of Southern California, and the Doheny Eye Institute (created by his wife). Sinclair Oil Corporation remains a major supplier of oil and gasoline in twenty-two states.\nIn 1924, in reaction to the Teapot Dome scandal, President Coolidge set up the Federal Oil Conservation Board to encourage closer coordination in oil production between the federal government and the oil industry. Its activities laid the basis for a loose interstate oil cartel that set crude oil prices until 1973.\nWalsh’s work set important legal precedents for the power of Congressional investigating committees. Sinclair had refused to answer some questions before the Senate committee on the grounds that Congress had no jurisdiction over his private affairs. In Sinclair v. United States in 1929, the Supreme Court upheld the right of the Senate to investigate the effect of the laws it passed. Earlier, in a spin-off investigation from Teapot Dome, Attorney General Daugherty’s brother, Mally Daugherty, had been called before a Senate investigating committee but refused to appear. In McGrain v. Daugherty, decided in 1927, the Supreme Court recognized that Congress had significant power to investigate the lives and activities of private citizens in carrying out its Constitutional duty to legislate, even though the Constitution nowhere specifically grants an investigatory power to Congress. Thus, the Walsh hearings produced a significantly broader understanding of the role of Congress as an investigatory body.\nThe special prosecutors filed two civil cases to cancel the disputed oil leases. Both cases were appealed to the Supreme Court, which voided the disputed oil leases in 1927, on the grounds of corruption and actions without basis in law. Teapot Dome and Elk Hills were then shut down, although Elk Hills was opened during World War II. In 1976, in response to the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973–1974, Congress directed that the naval reserves be brought into full production. They were transferred to the Department of Energy in 1977. Production at Elk Hills made it one of the largest producing oil fields in North America. In 1995, President William Clinton proposed selling the Elk Hills reserve as part of his administration’s efforts to reduce the size of government and to privatize some federal functions. In 1996, Congress approved legislation that directed that Elk Hills be sold to the highest bidder. Occidental Petroleum Company took over operations there in 1998 in the largest single divestiture of federal property in the history of the US government. The Buena Vista Hills reserve was transferred to the Department of the Interior in 2005. The Department of Energy retains control of Teapot Dome, which currently produces a small amount of crude oil and natural gas and earns approximately $5 million per year for the federal government.\nRobert W.

Teapot Dome Scandal - Spartacus Educational Teapot Dome Scandal\nTeapot Dome Scandal\n▼ Primary Sources ▼\nTeapot Dome Scandal\nIn the early part of the 20th century large oil reserves were discovered at Elk Hills, California and Teapot Dome, Wyoming. In 1912 President William Taft decided that this government owned land and its oil reserves should be set aside for the use of the United States Navy .\nOn 4th June, 1920, Congress passed a bill that stated that the Secretary of the Navy would have the power \"to conserve, develop, use and operate the same in his discretion, directly or by contract, lease, or otherwise, and to use, store, exchange, or sell the oil and gas products thereof, and those from all royalty oil from lands in the naval reserves, for the benefit of the United States.\"\nIn March 1921 President Warren Harding appointed Albert Fall as Secretary of the Interior. Soon afterwards he persuaded Edwin Denby , the Secretary of the Navy, that he should take over responsibility for the Naval Reserves at Elk Hills and Teapot Dome. Later that year Fall decided that two of his friends, Harry F. Sinclair (Mammoth Oil Corporation) and Edward L. Doheny (Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company), should be allowed to lease part of these Naval Reserves.\nAttempts were made to keep this deal secret but rumours began to circulate when it became known that Albert Fall was spending large sums of money. On 14th April, 1922, the Wall Street Journal reported that Fall had leased Teapot Dome to Harry F. Sinclair . President Warren Harding defended Fall by claiming that \"the policy which has been adopted by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Interior in dealing with these matters was submitted to me prior to the adoption thereof, and the policy decided upon and the subsequent acts have at all times had my entire approval.\"\nRobert La Follette and John B. Kendrick called for a Senate investigation into Albert Fall and the Naval Reserves. President Warren Harding died suddenly on 2nd August, 1923 and was replaced by his vice-president, Calvin Coolidge .\n(If you find this article useful, please feel free to share.

Senator Thomas J. Walsh , a Democrat from Montana, led the committee's investigation. Over the next few months, dozens of witnesses testified before the committee. On January 24, 1924, Edward Doheny admitted that he had lent Fall $100,000.\nSeven days later the Senate passed a resolution stating that the leases to the Mammoth Oil Company and the Pan American Petroleum Company \"were executed under circumstances indicating fraud and corruption\". Albert Fall and Edwin Denby were now both forced to resign from office.\nOn 17th October, 1927, Harry F. Sinclair appeared on trial charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. The trial ended prematurely two weeks later when the government presented evidence that Sinclair had hired a detective agency to shadow the jury. The judge declared a mistrial. Sinclair was tried for criminal contempt of court. Found guilty and he was sentenced to six months in prison.\nAlbert Fall was now charged accepting a bribe from Doheny. On October 7, 1928 the trial began in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Even though the trial concerned Fall accepting money from Doheny, the judge allowed M. T. Everhart's testimony showing the financial relationship between Sinclair and Fall. That testimony was used to show that Fall had lied to the Senate committee when he declared that he had not accepted any money from Sinclair. Fall was found guilty and sentenced to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.\n▲ Main Article ▲\nPrimary Sources\n(1) (1) Robert La Follette explaining in the Senate why he was opposed to what Albert Fall had arranged with Harry F.

Against the policy of any department of the Government of the United States entering into a contract of any character whatsoever, whether competitive or not, which would tend to continue or perpetuate a monopolistic control of the oil industry of the United States or create a monopoly on the sale of fuel oil or refined oil to the Navy or any other department of the Government.\nFor the following reasons:\nThere exists no emergency or necessity which would warrant the opening of the naval reserves at this time for exploitation in order that the Navy might be supplied with the various grades of oil required by it, there being already above ground and in storage in the United States the greatest amount of oil that has been in storage in the history of all times.\nThe prices of fuel oil at the seaboard are lower than they have been in years, and there is an abundant supply.\nThe oil industry of the United States is just now convalescing from the greatest depression it has ever suffered, the daily production now being the largest in its history, and therefore, the turning over of Government lands to the large pipe-line interests for exploitation will have the direct result of depressing the price of crude oil without in any way relieving the people of the onerous and burdensome high prices of refined products.\n(2) Thomas J. Walsh , The True History of Teapot Dome, Forum Magazine (July, 1924)\nIn the spring of 1922 rumors reached parties interested that a lease had been or was about to be made of Naval Reserve No. 3 in the state of Wyoming, - popularly known, from its local designation, as the Teapot Dome. This was one of three great areas known to contain petroleum in great quantity which had been set aside for the use of the Navy - Naval Reserves No. 1 and No. 2 in California by President Taft in 1912, and No. 3 by President Wilson in 1915. The initial steps toward the creation of these reserves - the land being public, that is, owned by the government - were\ntaken by President Roosevelt, who caused to be instituted a study to ascertain the existence and location of eligible areas, as a result of which President Taft in 1909 withdrew the tracts in question from disposition under the public land laws. These areas were thus set apart with a view to keeping in the ground a great reserve of oil available at some time in the future, more or less remote, when an adequate supply for the Navy could not, by reason of the failure or depletion of the world store, or the exigencies possibly of war, be procured or could be procured only at excessive cost; in other words to ensure the Navy in any exigency the fuel necessary to its efficient operation.\nFrom the time of the original withdrawal order, private interests had persistently endeavored to assert or secure some right to exploit these rich reserves, the effort giving rise to a struggle lasting throughout the Wilson administration. Some feeble attempt was made by parties having no claim to any of the territory to secure a lease of all or a portion of the reserves, but in the main the controversy was waged by claimants asserting rights either legal or equitable in portions of the reserves antedating the withdrawal orders, on the one hand, and the Navy Department on the other. In that struggle Secretary Lane was accused of being unduly friendly to the private claimants, Secretary Daniels being too rigidly insistent on keeping the areas intact. President Wilson apparently supported Daniels in the main in the controversy which became acute and Lane retired from the cabinet, it is said, in consequence of the differences which had thus arisen.\nThe reserves were created, in the first place, in pursuance of the policy of conservation, the advocates of which, a militant body, active in the Ballinger affair, generally supported the attitude of Secretary Daniels and President Wilson.\nThey too became keen on the report of the impending lease of Teapot Dome. Failing to get any definite or reliable information at the departments, upon diligent inquiry, Senator Kendrick of Wyoming introduced and had passed by the Senate on April 16, 1922, a resolution calling on the secretary of the interior for information as to the existence of the lease which was the subject of the rumors, in response to which a letter was transmitted by the acting secretary of the interior on April 21, disclosing that a lease of the entire Reserve No. 3 was made two weeks before to the Mammoth Oil Company organized by Harry Sinclair, a spectacular oil operator. This was followed by the adoption by the Senate on April 29, 1922, of a resolution introduced by Senator LaFollette directing the Committee on Public Lands and Surveys to investigate the entire subject of leases of the naval oil reserves and calling on the secretary of the interior for all documents and full information in relation to the same.\nIn the month of June following, a cartload of documents said to have been furnished in compliance with the resolution was dumped in the committee rooms, and a letter from Secretary Fall to the President in justification of the lease of the Teapot Dome and of leases of limited areas on the other reserves was by him sent to the Senate. I was importuned by Senators LaFollette and Kendrick to assume charge of the investigation, the chairman of the committee and other majority members being believed to be unsympathetic, and assented the more readily because the Federal Trade\nCommission had just reported that, owing to conditions prevailing in the oil fields of Wyoming and Montana, the people of my state were paying prices for gasoline in excess of those prevailing anywhere else in the Union.\n(3) (3) George Norris , Fighting Liberal (1945)\nStill another impressive bit of evidence of national apathy presented itself in the Teapot Dome scandal. It had its origin in the early months of the Harding administration. It became the subject of common gossip in Washington, and yet no betrayal of public trust resisted exposure and punishment more tenaciously.\nTeapot Dome involved the conservation of the oil resources of the United States, especially those situated upon the public lands. The investigation of alleged irregularities had been in progress for some time, under the auspices of the Senate Committee on Public Lands and Surveys, when the decision was reached to institute court action to cancel the leases granted to private interests at Teapot Dome and Elk Hills.\nMy old friend Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin, always alert and vigilant, had introduced and procured passage of the two resolutions - Senate Resolution 282, and Senate Resolution 294 - authorizing the Public Lands Committee to make the inquiry. Out of it came the evidence supporting the inescapable conviction that immense combinations of wealth, large corporations, under leases fraudulently obtained, were systematically robbing the government of the oil stored in the public lands by Nature. The evidence pointed straight to the guilt of a former colleague, A. B. Fall of New Mexico, who had become Secretary of the Interior.\n(4) Statement issued by President Calvin Coolidge on 27th January, 1924.\nIt is not for the President to determine criminal guilt or render judgment in civil causes. That is the function of the courts. It is not for him to prejudge. I shall do neither; but when facts are revealed to me that require action for the purpose of insuring the enforcement of either civil or criminal liability, such action will be taken. That is the province of the Executive.\nActing under my direction the Department of Justice has been observing the course of the evidence which has been revealed at the hearings conducted by the senatorial committee investigating certain oil leases made on naval reserves, which I believe warrants action for the purpose of enforcing the law and protecting the rights of the public. This is confirmed by reports made to me from the committee. If there has been any crime, it must be prosecuted. If there has been any property of the United States illegally transferred or leased, it must be recovered.\nI feel the public is entitled to know that in the conduct of such action no one is shielded for any party, political or other reason. As I understand, men are involved who belong to both political parties, and having been advised by the Department of Justice that it is in accord with the former precedents, I propose to employ special counsel of high rank drawn from both political parties to bring such action for the enforcement of the law. Counsel will be instructed to prosecute these cases in the courts so that if there is any guilt it will be punished; if there is civil liability it will be enforced; if there is any fraud it will be revealed; and if there are any contracts which are illegal they will be canceled.\n(5) Thomas J. Walsh , The True History of Teapot Dome, Forum Magazine (July, 1924)\nThe climax was reached when on January 24 Doheny voluntarily appeared to tell that on November 30, 1921, he had loaned $100,000 to Fall without security, moved by old friendship and commiseration for his business misfortunes, negotiations between them then pending eventuating in the contract awarded to Doheny on April 25, following, through which he secured, without competition, a contract giving him a preference right to a lease of a large part of Naval Re-\nserve No. 1, to be followed by the lease of the whole of it, as above recited.\nFollowed the appearance of Fall, forced by the Committee to come before it, after pleading inability on account of illness, to take refuge under his constitutional immunity, a broken man, the cynosure of the morbidly curious that crowded all approaches to the committee room and packed it to suffocation, vindicating the wisdom of the patriarch who proclaimed centuries ago that the way of the transgressor is hard.\n(6) Attlee Pomerene, Special Counsel in the Teapot Dome Scandal, letter to M. T. Everhart (24th September, 1924)\nOur contention is that in the bribery case evidence of similar transactions is competent for the purpose of showing the intent; in other words to characterize the end. It will be contended on the part of the defendant that the $100,000 was a loan. You and I feel confident that it was never intended that it should be repaid. Similarly, the Sinclair-Fall transaction in the form it took was a mere ruse.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nThe Teapot Dome Scandal. Juggernaut. This 1924 cartoon shows the dimensions ...

Sound familiar?\nTeapot Dome, the oil reserve scandal that began during the administration of President Harding. In 1921, by executive order of the President, control of naval oil reserves at Teapot Dome, Wyo., and at Elk Hills, Calif., was transferred from the Navy Department to the Department of the Interior. The oil reserves had been set aside for the navy by President Wilson. In 1922, Albert B. Fall, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, leased, without competitive bidding, the Teapot Dome fields to Harry F. Sinclair, an oil operator, and the field at Elk Hills, Calif., to Edward L. Doheny. These transactions became (1922�23) the subject of a Senate investigation conducted by Sen. Thomas J. Walsh\nOn April 15, 1922, Wyoming Democratic Senator John Kendrick introduced a resolution that set in motion one of the most significant investigations in Senate history. On the previous day, the Wall Street Journal had reported an unprecedented secret arrangement in which the Secretary of the Interior, without competitive bidding, had leased the U.S. naval petroleum reserve at Wyoming's Teapot Dome to a private oil company. Wisconsin Republican Senator Robert La Follette arranged for the Senate Committee on Public Lands to investigate the matter. His suspicions deepened after someone ransacked his Russell Building office.\nThe committee's leadership allowed the panel's most junior minority member, Montana Democrat Thomas Walsh, to lead what most expected to be a tedious and probably futile inquiry seeking answers to many questions, including \"How did Interior Secretary Albert Fall get so rich so quickly?\"\nEventually, the investigation uncovered Secretary Fall's shady dealings and Senator Walsh became a national hero; Fall would end up as the first former cabinet officer to go to prison. This and a subsequent Senate inquiry triggered several court cases testing the extent of the Senate's investigative powers. One of those cases resulted in the landmark 1927 Supreme Court decision McGrain v. Daugherty that, for the first time, explicitly established Congress' right to compel testimony.\nReference Items:\nDiner, Hasia. \"Teapot Dome, 1924,\" Included in Schlesinger, Arthur M., Jr., and Roger Bruns, eds.

Government efforts to break-up trusts and regulate business practices gave way to a new emphasis on partnerships between government and business.\nIn 1920, an Ohio political operator named Harry Daugherty offered a prediction about what would happen at that year's Republican presidential nominating convention:\nThe convention will be deadlocked, and after the other candidates have gone their limit, some 12 or 15 men, worn out and bleary eyed for lack of sleep, will sit down about 2 o'clock in the morning around a table in a smoke-filled room in some hotel and decide the nomination. When the time comes, [Warren] Harding will be nominated.\nDaugherty was right. In 1920, a divided Republican convention selected Harding, a U.S. Senator from Ohio, as its presidential nominee.\nHarding's presidency is best known for a series of scandals that marred his time in office. But he also had some genuine accomplishments. He pardoned the imprisoned Socialist party leader, Eugene Debs, and persuaded the steel industry to end the 12-hour day and replace it with an 8-hour day.  Harding also called an international disarmament conference in Washington that slowed down the arms race. At the end of the conference, a treaty was signed. The treaty provided that, for every five battleships that the United States and Britain were each allowed to build, the Japanese could build three ships, and the Italians and the French could each build one-and-three-quarters ships.\nThe son of a poor Ohio farmer, Harding spent two years at a rural academy, Ohio Central College, and received a diploma at the age of 16. He taught school and sold insurance for several years before he bought a local newspaper. He guaranteed the newspaperâ€™s success by mentioning every town resident in the paper at least twice a year. Harding described his editorial policy as \"inoffensivism.\" He later entered Republican politics, rising from lieutenant governor to U.S. Senator before being nominated for the presidency.\nHarding made few major pronouncements during the campaign. The Republican Party followed an associate's advice: \"Keep Warren at home. If he goes out on tour, somebody's sure to ask him questions, and Warren's just the sort of damned fool that will try to answer them.\" Harding largely confined his speeches to uncontroversial platitudes about the need to avoid moral crusades and return to \"normalcy\":\nAmerica's present need is not heroics but healing; not nostrums, but normalcy; not revolution, but restoration; not agitation, but adjustment; not surgery, but serenity....\nHarding had few illusions about his qualifications for the presidency. \"I am a man of limited talents from a small town,\" he said. He appointed a number of sleazy and corrupt officials to office. His administration was marred by scandals involving bribes and kickbacks at the Justice Department and the Veterans Bureau. After his sudden death from a stroke in 1923, his administration's biggest scandal, known as the Teapot Dome, was revealed. His Interior Secretary, Albert B. Fall, was sent to prison for accepting $360,000 in bribes for transferring U.S. naval oil reserves in Wyoming to oil operators in exchange for above ground petroleum storage. Private oil companies were also draining oil from federal lands.\nVice President Calvin Coolidge became president after Harding's death. Coolidge had come to national attention in 1919, when, as governor of Massachusetts, he broke the Boston police strike after declaring: \"there is no right to strike against the public interest, anytime, anywhere.\"\nCoolidgeâ€™s well-deserved nickname was \"Silent Cal.\" Some acquaintances wagered whether they could make him say more than two words. His answer: \"You lose.\" During the 1924 presidential race, reporters asked him whether he had any statement about the campaign. \"No,\" he replied. He was then asked whether he had anything to say about the world situation. \"No,\" he answered. Did he have anything to say about Prohibition? \"No.\" Then he told the reporters, \"Now remember, don't quote me.\" At the end of his presidency, he was asked whether he had a farewell message for the American people, he paused and said, \"Good-bye.\"\nCoolidge slept ten hours a night, napped every afternoon, and seldom worked more than four hours a day. He spoke out ardently on behalf of the nation's business culture. \"The man who builds a factory builds a temple,\" said Coolidge. \"The man who works there, worships there.\" The president was convinced that the formula for economic prosperity was simple: \"The chief business of the American people is business. If government kept its hands off the economy, business would prosper.â€�\nAmong the most notable acts of his presidency were vetoes of bills to assist farmers in developing government power plants along the Tennessee River. The best known accomplishment of his presidency was the Kellogg-Briand Pact, an international agreement outlawing the use of force to settle international disputes. Embodying the anti-war sentiment of the 1920s, this agreement lacked any methods of enforcement.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nA summary of the Teapot Dome scandal from the ... investigation and prosecution of the Teapot Dome scandal.

The Trail Ends\nPRESIDENTIAL                 APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL:\nTHE TEAPOT DOME MODEL\n     If Congress considers alternatives to a system of temporary,                 court appointed independent counsel, history provides an important model--the                 investigation and prosecution of the Teapot Dome scandal. In 1924, President Coolidge                 nominated two special counsel, one a Republican and one a Democrat, to investigate and                 pursue the civil and criminal cases arising from allegations that members of President                 Harding's cabinet had corruptly leased naval oil reserves to private oil firms. His                 appointees, Democrat Atlee Pomerene and Republican Owen Roberts, were confirmed by the                 Senate.\n     Deep concerns over the integrity of then Attorney General                 Harry Daugherty mobilized Congress and the President to look outside the Department of                 Justice for counsel who could be trusted to vigorously pursue the case. Once such counsel                 were appointed, Congress continued to play a critical role, aggressively pursuing the                 facts through a Senate committee and working cooperatively with special counsel to further                 their efforts. The President, for his part, offered counsel his assistance but then                 withdrew to permit them the necessary independence to pursue the wrongdoers. The                 investigation was fraught with difficulty and high drama, consuming more than six years                 and culminating in significant victories in civil litigation and a mixed bag of results in                 the criminal prosecutions. Special counsel suffered intermittent shortages of funds and for one of them, frustration with the impact of the job on his ability to maintain his law                 practice.\n     Those difficulties notwithstanding, history has largely judged                 the Teapot Dome investigation a success. The tale of corruption was told, the fraudulent                 leases were set aside and the oil leases returned to the government, and at least some of                 the perpetrators were successfully prosecuted. Consequently, when allegations of                 high-level wrongdoing in the government again arose, Teapot Dome has served as a call to                 action. See, e.g., Watergate:                 Clean-Up Precedent , Chr. Sci. Monitor, reprinted in 119 Cong. Rec. 13721 (1973)                 (Watergate); Byron York, How Congress                 Can Break Through the Reno Stonewall , Wall St. J., Dec. 16, 1997, at A18                 (Campaign finance).\n     Should the Teapot Dome model of presidentially appointed and                 Senate confirmed prosecutors be considered for any future investigation that has                 significant political implications?\n--Elaine W. Stone\n[TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     It started with rumors that members of the Harding             Administration had leased a rich naval oil reserve in Wyoming to private interests in             return for bribes. It resulted in numerous investigations, the resignation of several             cabinet members and civil and criminal prosecutions spanning more than six years. Teapot             Dome became the nomenclature for what North Dakota Senator Gerald Nye called \"the             slimiest of slimy trails beaten by privilege.\" S. Rep. No. 70-1326, Part 2, at 3 (1928) .             Seventy-five years later, it remains an important chapter in the ongoing debate over how             best to investigate and prosecute alleged criminal activity by high-level government             officials. (1)\n     A. The Leases\n       [TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     The naval oil reserves were three oil-rich tracts of land set             aside by the Taft Administration to provide naval ships with fuel in case of a national             emergency. Congress gave the Secretary of the Navy control over the reserves through the             naval appropriation bill approved on June 4, 1920. It provided that the Secretary of the             Navy would have the power \"to conserve, develop, use and operate the same in his             discretion, directly or by contract, lease, or otherwise, and to use, store, exchange, or             sell the oil and gas products thereof, and those from all royalty oil from lands in the             naval reserves, for the benefit of the United States.\" 41 Stat. chap. 228 (1920) .\n     The reserves consisted of three pieces of property: Naval             Reserve Number One, in Elk Hills, California; Naval Reserve Number Two, in Buena Vista,             California; and Naval Reserve Number Three, in Salt Creek, Wyoming, better known as Teapot             Dome because of the shape of a formation on the land.\n     The protection of the naval reserves was short-lived, however,             as private interests found a receptive ear in members of the Harding administration. Soon             after Albert B. Fall was appointed Secretary of the Interior, he sought to have             jurisdiction over the naval reserve lands transferred to the Department of the Interior.             Fall convinced Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby that he should support transferring             authority to Fall because he had more experience with such matters. President Harding             agreed and with the signing of Executive Order 3474, authority over the lands shifted from             the Secretary of the Navy to Secretary of the Interior. Executive Order No. 3474 . (2)\n     Critics were skeptical that Fall would adequately protect the             resource, since his record favoring commercial development was well known from his             participation on the Senate Public Lands and Surveys Committee. That skepticism was well             founded.\n     The first of the oil reserves surrendered to private interests             were in California. Edward L. Doheny was an \"old prospecting pal\" of Fall's and             the owner of the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company. During 1921 Fall and Doheny             began making preliminary arrangements for a lease of part of the Navy's oil reserves.\n     In November of that year, Doheny made what he and Fall would             later characterize as a loan to Fall. Doheny had his son draw $100,000 in cash from the             son's account, wrap the bills up in paper, put them in a little black bag and bring the             bag to Fall in Fall's apartment. In later testimony some thought implausible, Doheny             claimed that he had received a note from Fall for the money, eventually producing a note             whose signature had been torn off. Busch, Enemies of the State at 112-13.\n     During 1922, Doheny's company leased portions of California             Naval Reserve Number One (Elk Hills) and Number Two (Buena Vista). Doheny was obliged to             build storage tanks at Pearl Harbor, fill them with oil, erect a refinery in California             and build a pipe line from the naval reserves to the refinery. In return, Doheny received             exclusive rights to exploit about 30,000 acres of proven oil lands, with a profit             estimated by him at one hundred million dollars. Two other companies had expressed             interest but had insisted that Congress approve the proposed contract before it was             executed, a condition rejected by Fall and Navy officers. Werner and Starr, Teapot Dome,             at 42, 54-57, 84-86.\n     During the same period, Fall was secretly negotiating away             Wyoming's Teapot Dome, believed to be the richest of the remaining oil reserves. See 62 Cong. Rec. 6042 (1922) . Harry             F. Sinclair was head of the Mammoth Oil Company. In December, 1921, Fall entertained             Sinclair, his attorney, Colonel J.W. Zevely, their wives, and several others at his ranch             at Three Rivers, New Mexico: \"[i]n the evenings, Sinclair and Zevely sat before             Fall's ranch-house fire and discussed a lease to Sinclair of the entire naval reserve at             Teapot Dome.\" Werner and Starr, Teapot Dome at 56. They also discussed Fall's cattle             needs. After Sinclair returned home, Fall received six heifers, a yearling bull, two             six-months-old boars, four sows and for his foreman, an English thoroughbred horse. Id. at 57.\n     On February 3, 1922, Sinclair, Fall, Admiral John Robison             (Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Engineering and at one time in charge of the administration             of the Naval Petroleum Reserves), and others met in Fall's office to outline the terms of             an agreement. Teapot Dome would be leased in its entirety, Sinclair would build a pipe             line with adequate capacity from the Teapot Dome oil fields, and the proceeds from the             Navy's share of oil from the reserve were to be used by Sinclair to build storage tanks on             the Atlantic coast and fill them with fuel oil. Under their arrangement, the Navy would             not receive any cash, as cash would have to be turned over to the United States Treasury             and the Navy could then only benefit in the ordinary way, through congressional             appropriations. Id. at 59.\n     During these discussions, the participants considered whether             they should obtain an opinion from Attorney General Daugherty on the legality of the             exchange, but Fall rejected the idea:\n[W]hen questioned later about his failure . . . [to ask Daugherty for a legal opinion]               he said that he himself had been a lawyer for many years and neither needed nor wanted               outside legal opinions. In this way, Fall protected himself from cutting Daugherty in on               his profit and Daugherty was glad to be able to say later, when he was in trouble for               shady deals of his own, that at least he had had nothing to do with Teapot Dome.\nId. at 60-61. Fall, (Secretary of the Navy) Denby and Sinclair secretly signed             a lease for the entire tract on April 7, 1922, and Fall locked it in his desk drawer.\n     One month later (after a Senate inquiry into the leases had             already begun), Fall sent his son-in-law, M.T. Everhart, to see Sinclair in Sinclair's             private railroad car. Sinclair gave Everhart $198,000 in Liberty Bonds. Shortly             thereafter, Sinclair gave Everhart another $35,000 worth of the same issue of bonds.             Everhart in turn gave Sinclair a check for $1100, to pay for the livestock shipped from             Sinclair's farm to Fall (presumably because congressmen were now asking questions about             those gifts), and then advised Sinclair that Fall would like a loan. Sinclair obliged with             $36,000 in cash. Id. at 69-70.\n     As one historian wrote: \"By the time he was finished             leasing the navy's reserves, Fall had given his two benefactors reserves which each of             them estimated roughly to be worth $100,000,000, and he had collected from them $409,000             in cash and bonds.\" Id. at 86. With respect to Teapot Dome, an oil man would             later testify that it was so valuable that the government could have easily gotten \"a             bonus of at least $10,000,000, and possibly as much as $50,000,000, over and above the             royalties Sinclair was obligated to pay, if the lease had been awarded after competitive             bidding instead of in the privacy of Fall's ranch house.\" Id. at 79.\nB. Disclosure\n       [TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     Despite Fall's efforts to keep the Teapot Dome lease secret,             the news began to spread: \"[s]ome men in New Mexico became suspicious when they             noticed Fall buying more land and improving his property there, and oil men in Wyoming and             Colorado began to wire their Congressmen in protest and for information.\" Werner and             Starr, Teapot Dome at 64. On April 14, 1922, the front page of the Wall Street Journal             reported that Fall had leased Teapot Dome to Sinclair. Noggle, Teapot Dome: Oil and             Politics in the 1920's, at 36.\n     On April 15, 1922 the Senate passed Resolution 277, requesting             the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Interior to inform the Senate whether             negotiations were in fact pending to lease naval oil reserves and if so, the parties             involved, the terms and conditions of any such proposed agreements and \"whether             opportunity will be given the public for competitive bidding for the operation of these             lands . . . .\" See Senate             Resolution 277 (3) and S. Res. 277, 67th Cong. (1922)             (enacted) .\n     Responding to Senate Resolution 277, the first defenders of             the lease were Denby and since Fall was out of town, Acting Secretary of the Interior             Edward Finney. Denby and Finney provided the Senate with a copy of the lease. See S. Doc. No. 67-196 (1922) .             They rationalized in a letter to the Senate that the lease had been executed in the public             interest because crude oil in the reserves was unsuitable as fuel for naval ships so it             was necessary to exchange it for fuel oil and provide for the construction of storage             tanks to minimize evaporation. S. Doc.             No. 67-191, at 1 (1922) .\n     They also argued that drilling was necessary because millions             of barrels of oil had already been lost from the California reserves due to drilling from             adjacent lands and that Teapot Dome faced a similar fate. Id. at 1-2. Finally,             they asserted that the lease did not contradict the administration's policies as \"[t]he Interior Department and the Navy Department have been in close cooperation and             have been endeavoring, as they saw it, to carry out the purposes for which these naval             reserves were created, i.e., not the sale of oil for commercial or other purposes but the             securing of a reserve of fuel oil for Navy purposes.\" Id. at 3.\n     After the Senate received a copy of the lease, it unanimously             passed Senate Resolution 282 on April 29, 1922, providing for the Committee of Public             Lands and Surveys to conduct an investigation. Senate Resolution 282 (draft version) (4) and S. Res. 282, 67th Cong. (1922)             (enacted) . Senator Miles Poindexter, a Republican from Washington, defined the two             issues needing resolution:\nIn the first place, was it necessary for the Government to sink wells or to have wells               sunk upon its reserve in order to meet an attack upon the oil underneath its own property               by which it was being drained? In the second place, are the means which have been adopted               by the Government for doing that the proper ones, the best ones, to the greatest advantage               of the Government, which could be obtained?\n62 Cong. Rec. 6048 (1922) .\n     In response to Senate Resolution 282, Harding sent a             presidential message to the Senate, asserting that \"the policy which has been adopted             by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Interior in dealing with these             matters was submitted to me prior to the adoption thereof, and the policy decided upon and             the subsequent acts have at all times had my entire approval.\" S. Doc. No. 67-210, 67th Cong., 2d             Sess. , at III (1922). The message included a report from Fall, but Harding made clear             that Fall's explanation \"[was] not to be construed as a defense of either specific             acts or the general policies followed in dealing with the problems incident to the             handling of the naval reserves.\" Id. at 3.\n     Fall too declared that the report was not \"written in the             slightest degree as an attempt at defense of actions or of policies\" since \"[t]he writer recognizes no necessity for such defense.\" Id. at 26.             Closely following the President's message, Fall, in a letter to the Senate, again insisted             that he was in compliance with President Harding's Executive Order of May 31, 1921, giving             him permission to administer the naval reserves for the Secretary of the Navy and thus,             the lease was proper. H.R. Rep.             No. 67-1079, at 9 (1922) . Fall also insisted that he had discussed the Teapot Dome             lease with Denby. In his words, \"[t]he Secretary of the Interior has proceeded under             this order in constant communication and consultation and cooperation with the Secretary             of the Navy, and is so continuing at the present time.\" Id.\n     In the face of continuing reports that Fall's personal             fortunes had mysteriously improved, these assurances were not enough to quell growing             suspicion of wrongdoing. Members of the oil industry expressed their outrage to Wisconsin             Republican Senator Robert La Follette, who presented their point by point letter of             protest on the Senate floor on May 13, 1922:\n    First. Against the policy of the Secretary of the Interior and the               Secretary of the Navy in opening the naval reserves at this time for exploitation.\n    Second. Against the method of leasing public lands without               competitive bidding, as exemplified in the recent contract entered into between Secretary               Fall of the Interior and Secretary Denby of the Navy and the Standard Oil-Sinclair-Doheny               interest.\n    Third. Against the policy of any department of the Government of the               United States entering into a contract of any character whatsoever, whether competitive or               not, which would tend to continue or perpetuate a monopolistic control of the oil industry               of the United States or create a monopoly on the sale of fuel oil or refined oil to the               Navy or any other department of the Government.\n    For the following reasons:\n    There exists no emergency or necessity which would warrant the               opening of the naval reserves at this time for exploitation in order that the Navy might               be supplied with the various grades of oil required by it, there being already above               ground and in storage in the United States the greatest amount of oil that has been in               storage in the history of all times.\n    The prices of fuel oil at the seaboard are lower than they have been               in years, and there is an abundant supply.\n    The oil industry of the United States is just now convalescing from               the greatest depression it has ever suffered, the daily production now being the largest               in its history, and therefore, the turning over of Government lands to the large pipe-line               interests for exploitation will have the direct result of depressing the price of crude               oil without in any way relieving the people of the onerous and burdensome high prices of               refined products.\n62 Cong. Rec. 6893 (1922) .\n     News of the scandal was not only gaining the attention of             Congress and the press, but also weighed heavily on the mind of President Harding, who             commented while traveling across the country: \"I have no trouble with my enemies, I             can take care of them. It is my . . . friends that are giving me trouble.\" Noggle, supra at 56. Harding died             suddenly on August 2, 1922 while he was in San Francisco. Calvin Coolidge             assumed the presidency the next day.\nII.             The Trail Widens: Congress Investigates\nthe Teapot Dome Lease\n[TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     Hearings on the Teapot Dome oil lease began on October 15,             1923 before the Senate Committee on Public Lands and Surveys. Only three members were in             attendance at the first meeting. Since they lacked a quorum, the meeting was adjourned             until the following week. Senate Public Lands and Surveys Committee, 67th Congress 3rd             Session - 68th Congress, 1st Session: Minutes (October 15, 1923 and             October 22, 1923) . (5) That would be the first and only time the Senate Committee on Public Lands and Surveys             adjourned for want of a quorum during these Teapot Dome hearings.\n     As the steady stream of witnesses appeared before the             committee, starting on October 23, 1923 and continuing through May 14, 1924, each name was             penned in a small green notebook now housed at the National Archives. Id. (October 23-25, 1923). Senator Thomas Walsh, a Democrat from Montana, led the committee's             investigation. The committee's first witness was former Secretary of the Interior Fall,             who had resigned from his post effective March 4, 1923. Id. (October 23, 1923).             Fall was followed on the witness stand by Secretary of the Navy Denby. Id. (October 25, 1923).\n     Over the next few months, dozens of witnesses testified before             the committee. As the weeks passed, however, the investigation appeared to lose momentum             and was largely forgotten by the public. That changed in January 1924, when a tortured             account of Fall's finances began to emerge. On January 24, 1924, Edward Doheny conceded in             a statement that he read to the Senate committee that he had lent Fall $100,000, and             Doheny's son had carried the cash to Fall. Walsh's next step was to call for appointment             of special counsel.\nA.  A Call for Special Counsel\n       [TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     At an executive session of the Public Lands Committee on             January 26, 1924, a Saturday, Walsh proposed that he introduce on Monday a Senate             Resolution calling on President Coolidge to annul the leases of Teapot Dome and Elk Hills             and to appoint a special counsel to investigate and prosecute those involved. The             Committee unanimously agreed. Before Walsh could present the resolution to the full             Senate, however, Coolidge beat him to the punch. Coolidge issued a statement at midnight             that appeared in the newspaper the next day, on Sunday, announcing his intention to             nominate two special counsel:\n    It is not for the President to determine criminal guilt or render               judgment in civil causes. That is the function of the courts. It is not for him to               prejudge. I shall do neither; but when facts are revealed to me that require action for               the purpose of insuring the enforcement of either civil or criminal liability, such action               will be taken. That is the province of the Executive.\n    Acting under my direction the Department of Justice has been               observing the course of the evidence which has been revealed at the hearings conducted by               the senatorial committee investigating certain oil leases made on naval reserves, which I               believe warrants action for the purpose of enforcing the law and protecting the rights of               the public. This is confirmed by reports made to me from the committee. If there has been               any crime, it must be prosecuted. If there has been any property of the United States               illegally transferred or leased, it must be recovered.\n    I feel the public is entitled to know that in the conduct of such               action no one is shielded for any party, political or other reason. As I understand, men               are involved who belong to both political parties, and having been advised by the               Department of Justice that it is in accord with the former precedents, I propose to employ               special counsel of high rank drawn from both political parties to bring such action for               the enforcement of the law. Counsel will be instructed to prosecute these cases in the               courts so that if there is any guilt it will be punished; if there is civil liability it               will be enforced; if there is any fraud it will be revealed; and if there are any               contracts which are illegal they will be canceled.\n65 Cong. Rec. 1520 (1924) (as             reported by The New York Herald, January 27, 1924).\n     At the last minute, Attorney General Harry Daugherty, who had             theretofore demonstrated little interest in the matter, positioned himself as supportive             of the appointments. Daugherty's 11:25 p.m. telegram to Coolidge read:\nMay I again urge the desirability you immediately appoint two outstanding lawyers who               as such shall at once take up all phases of the oil leases under investigation of the               Senate or others and advise you as to the facts and law justifying legal proceedings of               any kind. As you know, I do not desire to evade any responsibility in this or other               matters; but considering that Mr. Fall and I served in the Cabinet together, this would be               fair to you, to Mr. Fall, and the American people, as well as to the Attorney General, the               Department of Justice, and my associates and assistants therein. I do not desire to be               consulted as to whom you shall appoint. The only suggestion I have to make in that regard               is that those appointed shall be lawyers whom the public will at once recognize as worthy               of confidence and who will command the respect of the people by not practicing politics or               permitting others to do so in connection with this important public business. Their work               can be done with or without the cooperation of the Department of Justice or anybody               connected therewith as you and they may desire. The Department of Justice is at all times               in this or any other matters at your service and at the service of your appointees in this               connection.\n65 Cong. Rec. at 1537-1538 .\n     The Washington Post on Monday ran a statement by Senator             Walsh, recounting his intention to present a resolution to the Senate \"authorizing             and directing the President to institute suit to annul the leases and to employ special             counsel who should have charge of the litigation.\" 65 Cong. Rec. at 1520 . Walsh,             skeptical of the coincidence that the committee would unanimously call for the appointment             of special counsel and the same day the President would announce the same desire, related             his belief that his plan was leaked to Coolidge. \"It was agreed that the action of             the committee should be regarded as confidential. But in the view of the statement from             the White House, to which so obviously the information was conveyed, I give you this             statement.\" Id.\n     In the Senate on Monday, offense was taken at Coolidge's             observation that special counsel from each party was needed because members of both             parties were involved. Representative Hatton Sumners, a Texas Democrat, protested:\nThis reservation of the American Nation against the day of its need was surrendered by               a Republican Secretary of the Navy; it was bartered away by a Republican Secretary of the               Interior. The transfer and the lease were approved by a Republican Cabinet. I do not               prejudge. But why try to dodge responsibility and talk about parties? There happens to be               but one party involved and some dastardly thieves who ought to be in the penitentiary.               But, gentlemen, it does not make any difference whether it were the Republican or               Democratic Party. It is the business of the party in power to face the American Nation,               stand responsible for the conduct of its administration, and to give the people of this               Nation a prosecution in this case that will restore the confidence of the people not in               the party in power merely, or any party, but in their Government, in the integrity of               their public officials.\n65 Cong. Rec. at 1582 .             Tennessee Representative Finis Garrett, a Democrat, said \"we upon this side of the             aisle are not objecting to the employment of special counsel\" but he vehemently             objected to what he saw as the President's politicization of the scandal:\n[W]hy did the President of the United States, the President of the whole people, for               the first time, so far as I know anywhere, any place, that this matter has been considered               or discussed, suggest the idea of political parties in connection therewith. You know, of               course, that it was an effort to try to stem the tide of suspicion running against so               large a part of this administration.\nId.\n     The idea of appointing two special counsel was well received             by Congress, in part because there were serious doubts as to whether the Department of             Justice and Attorney General Daugherty should conduct the investigation.\n     Senator William King, a Utah Democrat, was among those who             questioned whether \"the President long before had decided that he had no confidence             in the Attorney General or in any of the officials of the Department of Justice, and             therefore, he felt that somebody outside of the department ought to be selected?\" 65 Cong. Rec. at 1537 . Representative             Garrett suggested that the President was not the only one who had lost confidence in the             Department of Justice:\n[I]n view of the fact that we can not confide in the Department of Justice, in view of               the fact that the public can not confide in the Department of Justice, in view of the fact               that the President can not confide in his own Department of Justice, we feel that the time               has come to give him special counsel.\n65 Cong. Rec. at 1582 .\n     Accordingly, the Senate unanimously passed Joint Resolution 54             on January 31, 1924, stating that the leases to the Mammoth Oil Company and the Pan             American Petroleum Company \"were executed under circumstances indicating fraud and             corruption\" and \"were entered into without authority\" and \"in             violation of the laws of Congress.\" 65 Cong. Rec. 1728-1729 (1924) . It             directed the President to institute suit to cancel the leases \"and to prosecute such             other actions or proceedings, civil and criminal, as may be warranted by the facts in             relation to the making of said leases and contract.\" Id. at 1729. The             President was authorized \"to appoint, by and with the consent of the Senate, special             counsel who shall have charge and control of the prosecution of such litigation, anything             in the statutes touching the powers of the Attorney General of the Department of Justice             to the contrary notwithstanding.\" Id. The joint resolution authorizing             special counsel was signed into law on February 8, 1924. 43 Stat. chap. 16 (1924) . The             funding mechanism, a joint resolution for $100,000 to cover the special counsel's             expenses, was approved by the President on February 27, 1924. 43 Stat. chap. 42 (1924) .\nB. The Appointment of Atlee Pomerene and Owen Roberts\n       [TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     The Senate was acutely aware that public attention had focused             on the scandal and that the best legal talent was needed to prosecute the case.             Washington's Senator Clarence Dill, a Democrat, spoke:\nThey think a great national scandal has been unearthed. The case demands the biggest               men that the country has in its legal profession.\n. . . May I pause for a moment to remind Senators of the kind of a case that is. It is a               big case. Nobody knows the exact value of the properties involved. It is estimated at               probably a billion dollars. Mr. Doheny, Mr. Sinclair, and Mr. Fall will have the best               attorneys their millions can employ. The United States Government needs the biggest and               best prosecutors that can be had to meet those attorneys in the courtroom and carry the               criminal prosecution to conviction.\n65 Cong. Rec. 2548 (1924) .\n     The President's first two nominees, Republican Silas Strawn and Democrat Thomas Gregory, both had connections with the oil industry. Their nominations             were withdrawn when it became clear that the Senate would not approve their appointment.\n     Pennsylvania's Republican Senator, George Pepper, thought a             Republican attorney from Philadelphia, Owen Roberts, would make an excellent candidate,             and he suggested Roberts' name to Coolidge. Pepper then summoned Roberts to Washington.             Before meeting Coolidge, Pepper asked Roberts if he would be interested in \"a very             delicate piece of businessone which might make him a national figure, and one which             might ruin him because he would be stepping on the toes of some mighty big people.\" Werner and Starr, Teapot Dome at 153.\n     Roberts responded \"that he had never been overly             impressed by some mighty big people and asked what his friend had in mind.\" Id. Pepper revealed that \"he had recommended him to President Coolidge as one of the two             special counsels to try the oil cases and that they had an appointment with the President             for that afternoon at 2:30.\" Id. An historian described the meeting among             Coolidge, Roberts and Pepper this way:\nAfter Roberts and Senator Pepper entered the President's office, Coolidge waited until               they were seated and then said, \"I understand you're a farmer, Mr. Roberts.\" He               got up from his desk and pointed out a picture of his own farm in Vermont. Roberts, who               operated a farm at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in which he took some pride, said \"Guernseys are my money crop, and I've never shown a loss.\"\n    Coolidge considered this statement gravely for a moment and then               abruptly launched into the reason for the visit. He asked Roberts what he knew about               public-land laws.\n    \"Nothing whatever,\" Roberts replied. Senator Pepper tried               to explain away this frankness. The President turned to him and said, \"When I want an               interpreter, I'll call on you.\" Roberts then went on to say that he had been a               professor of the law of property at the University of Pennsylvania Law School for some               years, and that he did not think that he would have much difficulty studying the               public-land laws.\n    The President walked over to the window and stood gazing for a while               out at the White House lawn. There was a rather long silence. \"Pepper,\" the               President finally said, \"I can see no reason why I should not appoint this man.\" Then he turned to Roberts and said, \"If you are confirmed, there is one thing you               must bear in mind. You will be working for the government of the United statesnot               for the Republican Party, and not for me. Let this fact guide you, no matter what ugly               matters come to light. You may call on me for whatever assistance you may need. Don't               hesitate to ask.\"\nId. at 153-54.\n     Even though Roberts thus had Coolidge's seal of approval, he             needed Senate confirmation. Pepper highly recommended Roberts on the floor of the Senate:\n    For 25 years he has been engaged in the active practice of his               profession at a bar which is not without men of ability. He has emerged from the struggles               of the forum with a character unimpaired, a reputation unsmirched. He has stood the fire               test of professional life. He is recognized by his entire community as a gentleman of               integrity and honor.\n    Senators, the man is in the prime of life. He is 49 years of age and               a tower of physical strength. He is a ceaseless and tireless worker. When he is not in               court he will be found in his office early and late. He has recognized that the law is a               jealous mistress and has given but little time to activities outside the scope of his               profession.\n    . . . He began his experiences in active practice as an assistant               district attorney in Philadelphia and for several years prosecuted with effect criminals               at the bar of the courts. In the meantime he was building up a civil practice which has               attained proportions second to none in our community. He has been in court continuously               for 20 years. Day after day, week after week, term after term, he has tried all kinds of               cases and has acquired equal facility in the trial of all of them. He is an admirable jury               lawyer. He has the courage, the thoroughness of preparation, the resourcefulness, and the               personality necessary for success in that difficult branch of professional work. And he               has attained it.\n65 Cong. Rec. 2637-2638 (1924) .\n     Coolidge paired Roberts with former Senator Atlee Pomerene, an             Ohio Democrat. Pomerene was highly recommended by the man who had taken his seat in the             Senate in 1922, Republican Simeon Fess:\n    I simply desire to say this much about the man with whom I had a               contest in Ohio. I have known him for many years professionally; I have known him               politically, not much socially; but I know Atlee Pomerene as a man of unusual ability as a               lawyer, which must have been clearly manifested in the remarkable manner in which he               conducted the many investigations that were conducted by order of the Senate. I knew him               as a witness once in one of the investigations. I recognized that no person who knows               ability would question his ability and power as a cross-examiner. As a lawyer it would               appear to me that he would fill the position and meet the requirements contemplated by the               pending investigation.\n    I knew him very well politically. I do not believe that there is a               more upstanding, honorable, and courageous man in either party in my State than Senator               Atlee Pomerene.\n    . . . As a man of courage, I know no superior. As a man of probity,               there certainly can be no question about him. With my knowledge of this former opponent of               mine, I am free to say that I stated to the authorities here that it appeared to me that               Mr. Pomerene would be a very good representative of one of the political parties to carry               on the investigation. I have never known his Democracy to be questioned, and certainly I               did not think it was questioned when I was in a contest with him two years ago.\n65 Cong. Rec. at 2553 .\n     However, some in the Senate, like Washington Democratic             Senator Clarence Dill, believed the two nominees fell short of the mark:\n[I]n the appointment of Mr. Pomerene the President has chosen a man who has had no               experience at all in public land law, a man who has had no practice in equity cases in the               Federal courts, with the exception of one case, since he left the Senate. And this is the               attorney who is to have charge of the prosecution of these cases as the attorney in chief.\n    Mr. Roberts, the other man suggested, so far as I can learn, is a               reputable trial lawyer at the bar in Philadelphia, but he, too, knows nothing about public               land law. He, too, has no national reputation. He is a stranger to the public mind. Thus               the Senate is asked to confirm the nomination of two attorneys neither of whom has ever               made a national reputation as lawyers, neither of whom is fitted to handle the cases as               compared with the men whom they must necessarily oppose.\nId. at 2548 . Dill             stressed the importance of the Senate's role:\nI recognize fully, I hope, that ordinarily the power of confirmation in the Senate is               more or less a perfunctory power in most cases and seldom goes further than the               consideration of the reputation and general ability and character of a man. The ordinary               appointee of the President is selected to carry out his particular policies as his agent,               and, as such, is purely an administrative officer; but in this case there is a vast               difference. The attorneys in this case will not be the representatives of the President to               carry out his administrative policy. These attorneys are not to act under the Attorney               General; these attorneys are to represent not merely the President, but all the Senate and               the American people.\nId. Senator David Walsh, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Dill continued:\nMr. Walsh:\nI suppose the Senator will agree with me that these               attorneys will become more or less the agents of the Chief Executive, that they will be in               touch with him, and have to make reports to him from time to time; that their industry and               their enthusiasm will be measured somewhat by his interest and enthusiasm in the               successful prosecution of these cases. I suppose the Senator will agree with that. I ask               this question, has the Senator, as a member of the committee, or has any other member of               the committee, any reason to believe that for the sake of politics or for the sake of               covering up the facts there is any disposition on the part of the Chief Executive or the               executive branch of this Government not to prosecute these oil-scandal cases with               enthusiasm and with zeal and with vigor to a successful completion?\nMr. Dill: Mr. President I do not want to go into the motives of the               President of the United States. There may be justification for the suggestion of the               Senator\nMr. Walsh: I do not mean to make any suggestion. I have heard it               suggested that the committee have received no cooperation whatever from the executive               department\nMr. Dill: Certainly not\nMr. Walsh I want to know if the Senator is convinced, the resolution               having been passed, the people of this country may reasonably expect that the executive               departments, all of them, are going to get behind this prosecution and manifest an               interest in the successful prosecution of these cases?\nMr. Dill: I can only say to the Senator that I hope the President is               anxious and enthusiastic to prosecute these cases. There is a phase of that question which               does require consideration for a moment, and that is that when the President picks men who               are ordinary lawyers, considered from a national standpoint, and who have corporate               connections of which the people are suspicious, there is a probability that the public               will believe that the cases are not being prosecuted with the vigor with which they should               be prosecuted, with which the Senate desires to have them prosecuted. The danger is that               the people will think, because the President selects as attorneys men who are not the               great outstanding members of the profession, that he is not desirous of having these cases               prosecuted to their fullest success, and if the Senate permits this confirmation to go               through the Senate must share the responsibility. As one Senator, I refuse to have any               part in the responsibility. Such a selection will arouse suspicion in the public mind, and               if the cases fail, as they may fail, it will cause a revulsion of feeling in this country               that will endanger the very Government itself.\n    I want to say, Mr. President, that with the state of the public mind               as it is to-day, this is no time to do things which encourage public suspicion. The               American people everywhere are doubtful about the men here in Washington unearthing all               the facts. They are questioning the sincerity of many of us and the selection of counsel               who do not command public confidence when the counsel are so extremely important as they               are in this case will but add to the public suspicion, already too great.\nId. at 2551-2552 .\n     Nonetheless, Pomerene was approved by a vote of 59 to 13 on             February 16, 1924. Two days later, Roberts was approved by a vote of 68 to 8. That same             day, Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby sent his resignation to Coolidge.\n     One account states:\n    Offices were assigned to the special counsel in the Transportation               Building at 17th and H Streets. On their first day of work, Roberts and Pomerene had an               interview with Coolidge. Roberts reported to the President on his interview with Walsh and               the senator's warning about the uselessness of the Department of Justice under the               circumstances [see following section]. Coolidge listened to this account in silence and               then decided that the only solution was to turn over to special counsel Treasury               Department Secret Service men, who had a long tradition of quiet effectiveness and were               known to be incorruptible. As they were leaving, the President reiterated his invitation               to call upon him whenever help was needed, and he added that he had no doubt that they               would need it. \"And stop by the way,\" Coolidge said to Roberts with a faint               smile, \"stop back sometime and tell me more about those Guernseys.\"\nWerner and Starr, Teapot Dome at 160.\n     Within a month of the Senate's approval of Roberts and             Pomerene as special counsel, the two sought indictments against Fall, Doheny, and             Sinclair.\nC. Loss of Confidence in the Justice Department\n       [TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     Shortly after his confirmation as special counsel, Roberts met             with Senator Walsh who gave him this advice about Attorney General Daugherty:\nI wouldn't depend on the Justice Department for investigative purposes, nor would I               approach the Attorney General's office for information if I were you. . .. It is my               conviction that the man would go to any lengths to protect himself and his               friendsand make no mistake about it, the people we are after are friends of the               Attorney General. Harry Daugherty has had a hand in every dirty piece of business which               has come out of the Harding administration. There is every reason to believe that, at the               very least, Daugherty is one of the men who knows the whole sordid story of the oil               leasesand there is enough evidence to warrant the suspicion that he himself might               have profited from them. In addition, the Department of Justice and its Bureau of               Investigation are hand-picked by Daugherty and rotten to the core.\nWerner & Starr, supra at 159.\n     The Senate immediately moved to address the acute loss of             confidence in the Department of Justice that had necessitated the appointment of special             counsel. Amid calls for Daugherty's resignation, Montana Senator Burton Wheeler, a             Democrat, introduced Senate Resolution 157, providing for an investigation of the             Department. Wheeler articulated the reasons for investigating Daugherty and the Department             of Justice on the Senate floor:\n    Ever since the Attorney General has occupied the important position               which he now holds various charges have been made against him in the newspapers and by               individuals from one end of the country to the other. Recently when the oil scandal first               developed it appears that the Attorney General's name was mixed in it. It appeared, if you               please, that he was the friend of Ned McLean. Everybody knows that he was the friend of               Sinclair. Everybody knows that he was the friend of Doheny. Everybody knows that those               three men met in the apartment of the Attorney General from time to time . . . .\n    The newspapers in New York carried the details of how the Attorney               General's former partner and friend, Mr. Felder, was collecting money for the purpose of               selling offices, appointments, and for the dismissal of whisky (sic) cases in the city of               New York. Everybody who knows anything about the history of the matter knows that other               friends and confidential advisors of the Attorney General of the United States were               collecting money and were giving as their reasons for collecting it that they could use               influence with the Attorney General of the United States of America . . . .\n    Not only that, but when the startling testimony came out in the oil               investigation that McLean had given money to Fall there was not any prosecution. Then when               McLean subsequently testified that he did not give the money and when the testimony was               produced that Mr. Fall got the money from Doheny, that the money was sent in a sack by               Doheny's son, and taken in connection with the other testimony given by Doheny upon a               subsequent occasion, what effort was made on the part of the Attorney General or the               Department of Justice to arrest or prosecute Fall? On the contrary he was allowed to be at               large. He was allowed to stay in the house of Sinclair's lawyer. Throughout the entire               investigation not one scintilla of evidence has been offered to the committee by all or               any of the investigators of the Department of Justice.\n65 Cong. Rec. at 2769-2770 .             Wheeler would have gone further, but was persuaded to remove the following two clauses             from his resolution:\n    Whereas it appears that said Harry M. Daugherty has lost the               confidence of the President of the United States, as exemplified by the President's               statement that he intends to employ, at great expense to the Government, special attorneys               not connected officially with the Department of Justice, indicating that this department               can not be trusted with the prosecution of the cases which have arisen by reason of the               disclosures before the Senate Committee on Public Lands and Surveys and the United States               Veteran's Bureau; and\n    Whereas said Harry M. Daugherty has lost the confidence of the               Congress of the United States and of the people of the country, and the Department of               Justice has fallen into disrepute.\nId. at 2769.\n     Daugherty responded to Wheeler's charges by writing a letter             to Ohio Republican Senator Frank Willis:\n    It is interesting to remind you that before the introduction of this               resolution I requested the President to relieve me of the responsibility of prosecuting               Albert B. Fall, and those with whom he is alleged to have been acting in collusion,               because of the fact that Mr. Fall had been a member of the Cabinet in which I also served,               and that the country might be better satisfied to have the conduct of the prosecution in               control of lawyers in no way connected with the Government. You know that the President,               approving this suggestion, did place this whole matter in the hands of two of the ablest               lawyers in this country, Hon. Atlee Pomerene and Hon. Owen J. Roberts, whose appointments               have been confirmed by the Senate, and who are now in full charge of the particular               matters referred to in this resolution.\n. . . .\n    . . . I desire to say further that since I have been Attorney General I               have never acted upon any information received as Attorney General which resulted in my               personal profit. I was not called upon by Secretary Fall or anyone else for an opinion,               written or oral, in regard to the wisdom or legality of the oil leases, and I never               volunteered an opinion either written or oral, to Secretary Fall or anyone else. I had no               part of any kind of character, directly or indirectly, in the negotiations leading up to               the execution of the oil leases; no information ever came to me in connection therewith,               and the leases were executed without my knowledge and without any official requirement or               opportunity on my part to know of their execution.\n65 Cong. Rec. 3307 (1924) .\n     Senate resolution 157, directing a Senate committee to             investigate Daugherty's failure to prosecute, among others, the cases arising from the             Teapot Dome scandal passed by a vote of 66 to 1. 65 Cong. Rec. at 3410 . The             investigation also included \"numerous charges of illegality, graft, and             influence-peddling in the Justice Department.\" Hasia Diner, Congress Investigates --             A Documented History 1792-1974 15 (1983).\n     After much pressure from Coolidge and under protestations of             innocence, Daugherty resigned on March 28, 1924. Daugherty was replaced as Attorney             General by Harlan Stone, who was succeeded by John Sargent when Stone was appointed to the             Supreme Court in 1925.\n     With the change in Justice Department leadership, the need to             maintain separation between the two special counsel and the Department evidently             diminished. Roberts and Pomerene \"were 'specially retained' by the Attorney General             of the United States, to serve as special assistants to the Attorney General,\" and in             prosecuting Fall, worked with the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and another             counsel retained by the Attorney General. See United States v. Fall, 10 F.2d 648,             649 (D.C. Ct. App. 1925).\nIII.             The Special Counsel Follow the Trail\n[TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     Roberts and Pomerene began their investigation by studying the             Senate record, briefing the law and drafting complaints against the Pan American and             Mammoth Oil companies. Then they investigated the records of the Navy and Interior             Departments and sent out private detectives to gather evidence in California, New Mexico,             Texas and New York. Within six months, the two were managing a complicated and diverse web             of civil and criminal cases that would reach witnesses in Canada, France and Cuba. A             chronological list located in the Department of Justice Government Oil Case Files             memorializes the intensity of their effort during the first three years of their             investigation. Chronological Index of Activities of Special Counsel. (6)\n     Their investigation was not without dramatic incident. Secret             Service Agent Thomas B. Foster was detailed to the investigation and proceeded to examine             Fall's financial transactions. On his trail were both agents of the Department of             Justice's Bureau of Investigation and private detectives, assigned to follow him and find             out what he was discovering. On the trail in Colorado, he found his hotel room ransacked.             Werner and Starr, Teapot Dome at 171-73.\n     Atlee Pomerene's notes from 1925 reveal his thoughts on the             investigation:\nThe issues involved in the pending litigation are far-reaching . . . Can the Naval Oil               Reserves of such great value be bargained away in secret by public officials to their               favorites? Can millions of barrels of royalty crude oil be delivered to these same               favorites, without competitive bidding, for the construction of steel tankage and for fuel               oil? Can duel depots be thus established by the Secretary of the Interior and the               Secretary of the Navy, when this power never was lodged in the Secretary of the Navy by               the repeal legislation of 1913? Can the public business be thus transacted and in secret?               Shall men be permitted to make alleged \"loans\", (not to use an uglier term), to               public officials with whom they are dealing for the public domain? Shall these officials               be justified in representing to the public that the Naval Oil Reserves are not to be               leased while they are privately negotiating with and executing leases to others? Shall an               Admiral's course be approved, when he says: \"It was the intention that the public and               Congress should not get knowledge of what was being done until it had been in fact               done\"? These questions are involved in the pending litigation.\nAP-TO dated 4/29/1925 . (7) Pomerene's questions             would receive a variety of responses from the courts in the coming years.\nA. The Cases\n       [TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     Pomerene and Roberts brought numerous civil and criminal             actions against those involved in the fraudulent leasing of Teapot Dome and the Elk Hills             reserves. Two civil trials and six criminal trials ensued. Ultimately, these cases             restored the naval reserves to the United States, put Sinclair in jail for nine months for             contempt of Congress, and landed Fall in prison. Francis Busch, an historian, writes:\n    Today these cases have a dual significance. For lawyers they record               a highly complex and bitterly contested litigation in which both sides were represented by               some of the most brilliant advocates of their generation. For laymen these cases               demonstrate democracy's boast that no man, rich or poor, of high or low estate, is above               the law.\nBusch, Enemies of the State 91. (8)\n     1. Civil litigation\n      [TABLE OF CONTENTS]\na. United States v. Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company, Pan American Petroleum                 Company: Elk Hills Leases Voided\n     A civil complaint             was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California in             Los Angeles against the Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company and the Pan American             Petroleum Company to cancel the two contracts and leases of the Elk Hills reserve. The             bench trial opened October 21, 1924. Roberts and Pomerene represented the United States;             Frank J. Hogan headed a team of nine lawyers for the Pan American companies. Neither Fall             nor Denby took the stand; instead, their testimony and statements before the Senate Lands             Committee were introduced into evidence. Busch, Enemies of the State, at 118-19. On May             28, 1925, Judge Paul J. McCormick ruled that the contracts and leases were void and             ordered them canceled. See United States v. Pan American Petroleum and Transport             Company, 6 F.2d 43 (D. Cal. 1925).\n     Both parties appealed that decision to the United States             Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In January 1926, the Ninth Circuit             affirmed the cancellation of the leases and contracts and dealt a financial blow to Pan             American. Instead of affirming the district court's decision to credit the company for the             money spent on building storage containers pursuant to the contract, the appeals court             held that the company was not entitled to any such credit. See Pan American Petroleum             and Transport Company v. United States, 9 F.2d 761 (9th Cir. 1926). Pan American             applied for a writ of certiorari that was granted on March 22, 1926, but on February 28,             1927 the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. See Pan American             Petroleum and Transport Company v. United States, 273 U.S. 456 (1927).\nb. United States v. Mammoth Oil Company, the Sinclair Crude Oil Purchasing Company and                 the Sinclair Pipe Line Company: Teapot Dome Leases First Held Valid, then Voided On                 Appeal\n     On March 13, 1924,             a civil complaint was filed in the United States District Court for Wyoming against             Mammoth Oil, Sinclair Crude Oil Purchasing and Sinclair Pipe to cancel and annul the             Teapot Dome lease. In March 1925, the trial got underway. It too was tried before a judge.             Roberts and Pomerene again represented the United States. Martin W. Littleton led a group             of eight lawyers who represented Sinclair's companies. Sinclair, Fall and Denby did not             testify. Busch, Enemies of the State, at 119.\n     Special counsel faced considerable difficulty in obtaining the             testimony of important witnesses. Evidence had emerged that a short-lived Canadian shell             corporation had served as a vehicle to produce profits to oil interests in the form of             United States Liberty bonds. Some of those bonds had eventually found their way from             Sinclair to Fall. At this juncture, however, the government was unable to develop this             evidence. Several participants who testified had failed memories. A key Canadian witness,             H. F. Osler, refused to testify on grounds of the attorney-client privilege. The highest             court in Canada would eventually rule against that claim, but not until the Wyoming trial             was over. Two other witnesses, James O'Neil and Harry M. Blackmer fled for France before             they could be served with a subpoena. Letters rogatory were served, but they refused to             testify. Id. at 119-21.\n     Mahlon T. Everhart, Fall's son-in-law who had carried the             Liberty bonds from Sinclair to Fall, refused to testify on the grounds of             self-incrimination:\n    I have never been an employee of the United States Government. I               have never been in any way connected officially with the Mammoth Oil Company or with Harry               F. Sinclair. I had nothing at all to do with the transaction of the making of the lease of               Teapot Dome. I decline to answer on the ground aforesaid whether if I had anything to do               with any property for Mr. Fall I did it merely as his agent or his messenger.\n    I am asked the question \"If you had anything to do with any               property for Mr. Fall you did it merely as his agent or messenger, did you not?\" My               reply to that question is \"No.\" I desire to state to this court that I did have               in my possession certain bonds, about which Government Counsel has interrogated me; I had               them in my own right as a principal, and to give further evidence concerning same will, I               believe, tend to incriminate me . . . .\nTranscript of Record U.S.             v. Mammoth Oil Co., et al., 537 . (9)\n     The trial ended in March 1925. In June 1925, U.S. District             Court Judge Kennedy ruled that the contract with Mammoth Oil was valid and dismissed the             suit. See United States v. Mammoth Oil Company, the Sinclair Crude Oil Purchasing             Company and the Sinclair Pipe Line Company, 5 F.2d 330 (D. Wyo. 1925). Kennedy's             decision sparked considerable controversy. Letter from Albert D. Walton, United States             Attorney, to Atlee Pomerene, Special Counsel, 1-2 (December 13, 1930) . (10)\n     The government appealed the decision. In September 1926, the             U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit unanimously reversed the district             court and ordered it to cancel the lease and subsequent contracts. See United States             v. Mammoth Oil Company, the Sinclair Crude Oil Purchasing Company and the Sinclair Pipe             Line Company, 14 F.2d 705 (8th Cir. 1926). Pan American appealed to the Supreme             Court. In October 1927, the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding             that the lease and contracts should be declared void because of the conspiracy between             Fall and Sinclair. See Mammoth Oil Company, the Sinclair Crude Oil Purchasing Company             and the Sinclair Pipe Line Company v. United States, 275 U.S. 13 (1927).\n     2. Criminal prosecutions\n      [TABLE OF CONTENTS]\na. United States v. Harry F. Sinclair: Sinclair Convicted of Contempt of Congress\n     When the Senate             Public Lands and Surveys Committee called upon Harry Sinclair to answer questions, he             refused to testify, claiming that the committee lacked jurisdiction. On March 31, 1924, a             grand jury of the District of Columbia returned a criminal indictment charging Sinclair             with contempt of Congress.\n     The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia trial judge             found Sinclair guilty of contempt. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction             and held that Congress has the power to investigate and compel witnesses to testify. See             Sinclair v. United States, 279 U.S. 263 (1929).\nb. United States v. Edward L. Doheny, Edward L. Doheny, Jr. and Albert B. Fall:                 Defendants Acquitted of Conspiracy to Defraud the United States\n     On June 30, 1924,             a criminal indictment was filed in the District of Columbia charging Edward L. Doheny, his             son Edward L. Doheny, Jr. and Secretary Fall with conspiracy to defraud the United States.             On November 22, 1926, the trial began. After extensive testimony from witnesses, hundreds             of exhibits and nineteen hours of deliberation, the jury found the defendants not guilty.             Alabama Senator James Heflin, a Democrat, expressed his dismay at the result. Especially             disturbing to him were reports that the jury broke into song before announcing the             verdicts:\nMr. President, all law-abiding citizens will hang their heads in shame and humiliation               as they read about this farcical court proceeding in the Capital of the Nation. God help               us as the trusted representatives of the people to wake up to the dangers that threaten               our country. Think of it; one of these men, Fall, occupied a place in a President's               Cabinet. He held a high and responsible position in the controlling force of the greatest               government of the globe; and now, after the testimony shows him to be guilty of betraying               this trust and betraying his country, his criminal conduct is condoned and sanctioned by a               rollicking, singing jury in the District of Columbia, here in the Capital of the Nation.\n68 Cong. Rec. 569 (1926) .\nc. United States v. Albert B. Fall and Harry F. Sinclair: Conspiracy to Defraud Case                 Ends in Mistrial and Sinclair Convicted of Criminal Contempt of Court\n     On June 30, 1924,             a criminal indictment was filed in the District of Columbia charging Albert B. Fall and             Harry F. Sinclair with conspiracy to defraud the United States. The trial began on October             17, 1927 but ended prematurely two weeks later when the government presented evidence that             Sinclair had hired a detective agency to shadow the jury. The judge declared a mistrial.             Sinclair was tried for criminal contempt of court. More than a hundred witnesses were             called. The trial judge found Sinclair and his associates guilty. Sinclair was sentenced             to six months.\nd. United States v. Harry F. Sinclair: Sinclair Acquitted of Conspiracy to Defraud\n     After several             continuances necessitated by Fall's deteriorating health, special counsel chose to pursue             the conspiracy to defraud charge against Sinclair alone. In April 1928, the conspiracy to             defraud trial against Sinclair got underway in the Supreme Court of the District of             Columbia. Much of the testimony was the same as was heard in the civil trial involving             Sinclair and Fall, where Sinclair had refused to testify on grounds of self-incrimination. The notable exception was the testimony of M.T. Everhart, who for the first time gave             details of how he had carried a package of bonds from Sinclair to Fall.\n     Obtaining Everhart's testimony was a coordinated effort by             special counsel, the Department of Justice and Congress, spurred by a suggestion from             Senator Alva Adams, a Colorado Democrat:\nI am not able to give you accurate information as to the motives which led Mr. Everhart               to persist in refusing to testify, but am disposed to think from what I have heard that he               has been impressed with the idea that having taken the position which he did in Cheyenne               that it was his duty as a matter of loyalty and consistency to persist in the same course.               His family and close associates feel greatly outraged that Secretary Fall should put Mr.               Everhart in this position and apparently insist on him continuing in a course so damaging               to him. Mr. Everhart reported on his return that he received the utmost consideration and               courtesy from you and Mr. Roberts but that his treatment from those whom he was               befriending and protecting was discourteous and a little short of shameful. I believe that               Mr. Everhart will welcome the passage of legislation to force him to testify. The service               of subpoena upon Mr. Everhart for his appearance at the next hearing should be made upon               him at as early a date as possible. Such early service, I am permitted to say to you, will               not be unwelcome and may be advisable.\nLetter from Alva Adams, Senator, to             Atlee Pomerene, Special Counsel (November 14, 1927) . (11)\n     The strategy used to elicit Everhart's testimony was a change             to the statute of limitations for fraud against the United States and its agencies.             Several witnesses had used the then-existing six year limitation as a reason not to             testify; still subject to prosecution, they claimed they would incriminate themselves. By             reducing the limitation to three years, Everhart and others would not face charges.             Pomerene requested that the Assistant to the Attorney General William Donovan consider the             idea and \"have some of your experts draw this proposed amendment\" since they             were \"most anxious to have some legislation bearing upon this subject.\" Letter from Atlee Pomerene, Special             Counsel, to William Donovan, Assistant to the Attorney General (November 14, 1927) . (12)\n     Roberts was hesitant to support special legislation and             suggested that the same goal could be accomplished by providing immunity for Everhart \"giving the right to the district attorney or prosecuting officer to insist upon the             testimony, conditioned upon the statement that the witness shall not be prosecuted by             reason of any matter or thing connected with his testimony.\" Letter from Owen Roberts, Special Counsel,             to Atlee Pomerene, Special Counsel, 1-2 (December 8, 1927) . (13) Further, Roberts             speculated that calling Everhart to the stand and having him refuse to answer the             questions could be as effective as his actual testimony. After Everhart had refused to             answer questions posed to him at the Sinclair trial, Roberts had heard that the jurors             were of the opinion \"that in view of his performance there could be very little doubt             that there was something radically wrong and crooked about the deal.\" Id. Nevertheless, Pomerene pursued the idea of reducing the statute of limitations.\n     An assistant to Attorney General Donovan had an amendment             drafted that changed the six year limitation to three years. Letter from William Donovan, Assistant to             the Attorney General, to Atlee Pomerene, Special Counsel, 1 (December 7, 1927) . (14) Pomerene then met             with Senator Walsh who was \"rather disposed to favor the repeal of the section             extending the statute of limitations to six years, so as to leave the old exemption stand             at three years.\" Letter from Atlee             Pomerene, Special Counsel, to Owen Roberts, Special Counsel, 1 (December 10, 1927) . (15) Roberts responded to             Pomerene, with a measure of reserve:\nIt seems to me that you have acted promptly and taken all the steps that it is               necessary special counsel should take in the premises. After all, it is not our business               to press legislation affecting the cases in which we are concerned. It does seem to be our               duty to call to the attention of the proper parties any situation where it may be deemed               proper to get additional legislation. When this has been done we have done our duty as it               seems to me, and perhaps we ought not to be in the position of pressing for legislation.\nLetter from Owen Roberts, Special             Counsel, to Atlee Pomerene, Special Counsel (December 12, 1927) . (16)\n     Thereafter, when asked by the Attorney General for his opinion             on whether the President should sign the legislation reducing the statute of limitations,             Roberts expressed his support: \"[t]he old six year statute has stood greatly in our             way in the oil prosecutions for the reasons that witnesses have been enabled to allege             that they might be in some way connected with the oil transactions which constitute a             fraud on the Government, and that therefore they are liable to self incrimination, and             have therefore refused to testify.\" Letter             from Owen Roberts, Special Counsel to John Sargent, Attorney General (December 23, 1927) . (17)\n     Everhart first tried to avoid testifying at Fall's trial. He             called Senator Adams and asked \"what he could do in regard to a subpoena just served             on him\" because he believed \"there [was] nothing which he can contribute to the             present trial.\" Letter from Alva             Adams, Senator, to Atlee Pomerene, Special Counsel (September 19, 1929) . (18) Adams suggested that             Everhart \"communicate directly with [Pomerene].\" Id.\n     That same day, Everhart sent Pomerene a letter suggesting that             he be \"relieve[d] . . . of making a trip to Washington at this time\" because of             his livestock business. Everhart explained that he had no information regarding Doheny and             Fall: \"inasmuch as I did not participate in any way in these transactions and have no             knowledge whatever concerning them other than newspaper reports and hearsay, it has             occurred to me that I will be unable to be of any benefit to the Special Counsel as a             witness in the case.\" Letter from             M.T. Everhart to Atlee Pomerene, Special Counsel (September 18, 1929) . (19)\n     Pomerene wrote back to Everhart, apologizing for the             inconvenience but said it was \"impossible for us to excuse you\" because \"[t]he testimony which you have in the Sinclair case is competent in the present             case.\" Letter from Atlee Pomerene,             Special Counsel, to M.T. Everhart (September 24, 1929) . (20) In Pomerene's             response to Senator Adams, written on the same day, he further illuminates the need for             Everhart's testimony:\nOur contention is that in the bribery case evidence of similar transactions is               competent for the purpose of showing the intent; in other words to characterize the end.               It will be contended on the part of the defendant that the $100,000 was a loan. You and I               feel confident that it was never intended that it should be repaid. Similarly, the               Sinclair-Fall transaction in the form it took was a mere ruse.\n    Of course, we do not for a moment think that Mr. Everhart was in the               real confidence of either of them.\n    I am writing you this confidentially.\n     Everhart's testimony at Fall's criminal trial did not             disappoint. For the first time, the financial connection between Sinclair and Fall was             confirmed. Everhart admitted that he had received the bonds from Sinclair in May 1922 and             delivered them to Fall:\nQ:\nWhen you got to Mr. Sinclair's private car, what if anything, did               Mr. Sinclair give you?\nA: He gave me a package of bonds.\nQ: A package of bonds.\nA: Yes.\nQ: What kind of bonds?\nA: They were three and one half percent Liberty Bonds.\nQ: Were they counted there in your presence, in his car?\nA: No, sir.\nQ: Did you open them?\nA: No, sir.\nQ: Where did you take them?\nA: I took them to the Wardman Park Hotel.\nQ: Who lived there?\nQ: To whom did you deliver them?\nA: To him.\nU.S. v. Fall, Trial             Transcript, Vol. 8, at 818-819 (October 15, 1929) . (22)\n     Everhart's testimony would later prove pivotal to Fall's             conviction, but here the jury found Sinclair not guilty. Pomerene speculated that \"if             the oil cases could have been tried in other jurisdictions the result would have been             different.\" Letter from Atlee             Pomerene, Special Counsel, to George Norris, Senator (April 24, 1928) . (23)\ne. United States v. Albert B. Fall: Fall Convicted of Accepting a Bribe from Doheny\n     On June 30, 1924,             a criminal indictment was filed in the District of Columbia charging Albert B. Fall with             accepting a bribe from Doheny. On October 7, 1928 the trial got underway in the Supreme             Court of the District of Columbia, despite Fall's deteriorating health. Even though the             trial concerned Fall accepting money from Doheny, the judge allowed Everhart's testimony             showing the financial relationship between Sinclair and Fall. That testimony was used to             show that Fall had lied to the Senate committee when he declared that he had not accepted             any money.\n     The trial transcript shows that on October 25, 1929, when the             judge called the jurors by name to report their verdict they each said \"guilty.\" Perhaps responding to Fall's ill health, they then each asked for \"mercy of the             Court.\" U.S. v. Fall,             Trial Transcript, Vol. 16 (October 24, 25 1929) . (24) Fall moved for a new             trial on the grounds that admitting the Everhart testimony was improper. That motion was             overruled. Fall was sentenced to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine. Fall appealed the             decision. On April 7, 1931, the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. The court             identified Everhart's testimony as pivotal:\n[These are] evidentiary facts tending to establish the relations between Fall and               Sinclair. Considering the close relation of the parties, that, in the handling of the               bonds between Sinclair and Fall, Everhart had been the intermediate agent, we think that               all these transactions were evidentially relevant to the general issue of conveying to the               jury the full Sinclair-Fall transactions as evidence of the motive and intent that Fall               had in receiving the money from Doheny in the present case.\nAlbert B. Fall v. United States, 49 F.2d. 506, 513 (D.C. Ct. App.) cert.             denied, 283 U.S. 867 (1931). Fall's application for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme             Court was denied on June 6, 1931. His application for an executive pardon likewise was             refused. Fall was incarcerated at the New Mexico State Penitentiary in Santa Fe and served             a little more than nine months.\nf. United States v. Edward L. Doheny and Edward L. Doheny, Jr.: Defendants Acquitted                 of Offering that Bribe to Fall\n     On June 30, 1924,             a criminal indictment was filed in the District of Columbia charging Doheny and his son             with offering a bribe to Fall -- the same bribe which Fall had been convicted of receiving             from the Dohenys. The evidence \"was practically identical\" in the two cases,             with \"one important difference -- [at the Dohenys' trial] no testimony was offered on             Fall's financial transactions with Sinclair. Werner and Starr, Teapot Dome at 167. The             Dohenys were acquitted by a jury.\nB. Roberts Seeks to Resign\n       [TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     Roberts had a successful law practice before he became special             counsel, one to which he attempted to return in the waning days of the prosecutions.             However, it was Attorney General John Sargent's opinion that since Roberts was appointed             by the President, with the \"advise and consent of the Senate\" that Roberts was             an officer prohibited from practicing before different departments of the federal             government. H.R. Rep. No. 70-1959, at             2-3 (1928) . He contended that Roberts' representation of a client before the Board of             Tax Appeals, would violate the law that prohibited United States officers from             representing parties against the United States.\n     Roberts grew increasingly frustrated with the limitations thus             imposed on his practice. When Pomerene requested advice from Roberts concerning the case             involving the Elk Hills tract, Roberts responded \"I note that you have advised the             parties that you will not agree to anything without conferring with me. As I have             heretofore advised you that I cannot take any part in this trial I think that you should             do exactly what you want about the matter without any reference to me.\" Letter from Owen Roberts, Special Counsel             to Atlee Pomerene, Special Counsel (September 20, 1928) . (25)\n     The following day Roberts again wrote to Pomerene distancing             himself from the litigation and expressing his intention to resign:\nI am going to Washington next week to see the Attorney General and to ask him to permit               me to formally resign from all of my appointments other than the appointment of President               Coolidge in the oil cases. I am doing this preliminarily prior to going to the Treasury               Department and trying to get straightened out the question of my right to practice before               the Treasury. I have spoken to you about this matter before, that the Treasury's attitude               up to date has been one that has caused me a great deal of inconvenience and loss.\nLetter from Owen Roberts, Special             Counsel, to Atlee Pomerene, Special Counsel (September 21, 1928) . (26)\n     Senator Walsh then sent Roberts a letter disagreeing with the             Attorney General's position and expressing his hope that Roberts would reconsider his             decision:\nI notice by the press that you have apparently severed your connection with the work               that devolved on you in connection with the lease of the oil reserves. I hope there is               some mistake about this. I understood your employment was \"for the duration of the               war,\" and if so I am sure you will feel, as I do that you ought to stay with the               fight to the end.\n. . . .\n    The intimation has reached me in some way that you quit because of the               loss to which you are subject in consequence of a supposed inability to represent clients               before the departments or Government boards or commissions. I can not believe that you are               subject to any such inhibition. The place you fill is one of employment, rather than an               official situation, I would say without giving study to the subject.\nS. Rep. No. 70-1338, at 1 (1928) .\n     Walsh suggested that the matter be resolved by Congressional             action and proposed to \"undertake to get through an appropriate joint resolution,             relieving you from the operation of the law.\" Id. Roberts welcomed the             suggestion and commented that President Coolidge had made a similar proposal. See id. at 2-3. As Roberts characterized it, the Attorney General's position forced him \"to             sit here and twiddle my thumbs for 18 months or 2 years to come while the Senator and I             finished up the few matters that remain in the oil cases and practically stay out of all             business.\" Id. at 2.\n     The joint resolution met with little opposition in the Senate.             There was one lone voice raised in opposition in the House, that of New York Republican             Representative Fiorello La Guardia:\n    It simply singles out one man and sets aside wise, sound, and               necessary provisions of the law in order to obtain the legal services of one particular               lawyer . . . .\n    I do not believe and can not agree that there is only one man in the               United States who can prepare the briefs and argue the particular case for the Government               in this particular instance . . . .\n    But assuming that . . . a lawyer has the government, so to speak, by               the throat, assuming that he is the only man who can prepare these briefs and argue the               case, then I submit it is manifestly unfair for him to say, \"I will not continue. I               will resign unless you amend the law especially for me so that I can come in and practice               before the departments of the Government in matters against the United States, even though               I am retained as special counsel for the same United States.\"\n70 Cong. Rec. 830 (1928) . La             Guardia observed that the Teapot Dome investigation had become a sacred cow:\nWhen the oil cases are mentioned, it seems everybody is afraid to speak. . . . [i]f you               are going to annul the law prohibiting a Government official from appearing against the               Government, you are going to destroy a great protection for the government and Government               resources.\n    I will state frankly that considerable pressure has been brought for               the passage of this resolution. This matter was mentioned in the message from the               President of the United States. He recommends the passage of the resolution. It has passed               the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House has reported it out without a               dissenting vote except my own; but if I am the only Member of this House to-day to take               this position, I am going to take it and stand here and oppose it, because I               conscientiously consider it unwise and dangerous.\nId. The resolution passed both the House and Senate and was signed by the             President on December 21, 1928. See 45 Stat. chap. 45 (1928) .\nC. Special Counsel Face Financial Difficulties\n       [TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     Congress made a number of $100,000 appropriations for the work             of the special counsel. The first $100,000 appropriation was signed on February 27, 1924. See 43 Stat. chap. 42 (1924) .\n     Even though appropriations for expenses of the special counsel             went smoothly from 1924-1927, problems arose in 1928. In a meeting with Coolidge, Pomerene             told him that since February 3, 1928, no payments had been made for \"ourselves, or             assistants, or clerks, or expenses.\" Memorandum from Atlee Pomerene In Re:             Naval Oil Litigation - Special Counsel, Conferences with President and Attorney General, 1             (May 27, 1930) . (27)\n     On the same day, May 26, 1930, Pomerene so advised the             Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations. He explained that the special             counsel had received no money for more than two years and asked for a reappropriation of             $149,707.51, the balance of the appropriation that had been made the year prior. Pomerene             suggested that \"[n]ot much of that appropriation has been expended, due perhaps to             our negligence in presenting bills, I guess.\" Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill,             1930: Hearings Before the Subcomm. of House Committee on Appropriations, 71st Cong. 826             (1930) . (28) Pomerene explained, \"Mr. Roberts has paid the assistants in his office, and my firm             of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey have paid my assistants. We have paid our own hotel and             other expenses-except, of course, our railroad fares and Pullman fares were paid by travel             vouchers, also telegraph and telephone charges were largely paid by the Government.\" Id. at 831. Pomerene told the committee \"all that money is subject to disbursement by the             President.\" Id. By Executive Proclamation, the President extended the             balance of the available appropriations to June 30, 1932 to enable Roberts and Pomerene to             conclude their work.\nIV.             The Trail Ends\n[TABLE OF             CONTENTS]\n     In the wake of the Teapot Dome investigation tumbled the             resignations of Secretary of the Interior Fall, Secretary of the Navy Denby and Attorney             General Daugherty. The scandal would forever cast a shadow on the Harding administration.             On February 25, 1928, the President returned the administration of the oil and gas naval             reserves to the Secretary of the Navy. 45 Stat. chap. 104 (1928) . The \"slimy trail\" finally ended, as North Dakota Senator Gerald Nye observed:\nThe investigation has shown, let us hope, privilege at its worst. The trail is one of               dishonesty, greed, violation of law, secrecy, concealment, evasion, falsehood, and               cunning. It is a trail of betrayals by trusted and presumably honorable men--betrayals of               a government, of certain business interests and the people who trusted and honored them;               it is a trail showing a flagrant degree of the exercise of political power and influence,               and the power and influence of great wealth upon individuals and political parties; it is               the trail of despoilers and schemers, far more dangerous to the well-being of our Nation               and our democracy than all those who have been deported from our shores in all time as               undesirable citizens. And in the end the story is one of the crushing of brilliant careers               when finally the light was played upon those who schemed those unhealthy schemes born in               darkness.\nS. Rep. No. 70-1326, at 3 (1928) .\n     Owen Roberts ceased his work as special counsel when he was             appointed as a Justice to the Supreme Court in 1930.\n     Atlee Pomerene saw the litigation to the end. Among his last             acts as special counsel was to pursue compensation from companies that had bought Teapot             Dome oil from Mammoth Oil Company when Mammoth's bankruptcy meant recovery was impossible.             Pomerene recovered more than $26,000 from Sinclair Pipe Line Company and Midwest Refining             Company. Pomerene was later appointed by President Hoover to head the Reconstructionist             Finance Corporation but was replaced when Franklin Delano Roosevelt took office.\nThe two were widely praised, even though some of their prosecutions were unsuccessful:\n[They] left no stone unturned to win their case. No avenue of evidence was left               unexplored, and no pains or expense were spared in preparing for trial. The government's               side could not have been in more able hands. The skill with which the evidence was amassed               and arranged, and the ability with which it was presented to the jury, left no possible               room for adverse criticism. Messrs. Roberts and Pomerene adhered to the finest traditions               of American jurisprudence throughout the preparatory and trial stages of this celebrated               case; and no one who followed the case could doubt that if a verdict of guilty had been               forthcoming it would have been due to the extraordinary efforts and ability of the               government's counsel.\n \n \nNote: The views expressed in             this piece are those of the author and should not be attributed to the staff, officers or             trustees of the Brookings Institution.\nCopyright � 1999 The Brookings Institution\n\n"
