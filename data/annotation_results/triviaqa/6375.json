Vintage Caraway Cake {anyone for tea?} | Foods of Our Lives Vintage Caraway Cake {anyone for tea?} | Foods of Our Lives\nFoods of Our Lives\nShare\nVintage Caraway Seed Cake {anyone for tea?}\nThis is a cake I saw in my vintage cake book  that I am baking my way through and just had to make. It just sounded so completely different and I really didn’t know what to expect.\nI did read up on Caraway Seed and found that it has a slight anise flavor to it, but I didn’t read up on the origins of the cake until after I had made it and tried it.\nIt took me a couple bites of the cake to figure out what I thought about it. I liked it, but it was kind of strange. But I thought to myself, it must be a tea cake. It just tastes like something you would have at tea.\nThat’s why I looked up the history of the seed cake.\nAccording to Wikipedia, it was a popular cake in Great Britain to make after the harvest of the spring wheat. Caraway seeds were so popular that they were used in about 14 different recipes and were also popular in Ireland and Wales.\nOf course having already made the cake, I found out it is traditionally made in a loaf pan. I had made it in a square 8×8 pan….whoops.\nI also added the whipped cream on a whim because I thought it tasted good – don’t all cakes taste good with whipped cream? But it’s not really supposed to have whipped cream on it. Ha! Oh well….I liked it that way.\nThis was an easy cake to make and I thoroughly enjoyed it and did end up having a slice with a bit of tea and it was very tasty.\nVintage Caraway Seed Cake {anyone for tea?}\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nRecipes using caraway seeds Main course. ...

They can be used in English comfits and seed cakes, the Arabic spice mixture tabil, North African harissa paste, and north Indian curries. Liqueurs such as kummel, schnapps and aquavit are all flavoured with caraway.\nArticle by Sejal Sukhadwala\n\n"
