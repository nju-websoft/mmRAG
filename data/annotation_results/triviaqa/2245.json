Black Russian Cocktail Black Russian Cocktail\nAdd to favourite recipes\nBlack Russian Cocktail\nShake the vodka and kahlua. Pour over the ice. Top up with cola. Serve in a tumbler.\nIngredients:\nHow do you rate it?\nRate Cocktail\nLeave some comments about the Black Russian\nblack russian is now a triple vodka in a pint of guiness\nby prolific\nthe ingredients are correct. 2 shots of vodka, 1 shot of kahlua or tia maria whatever, both are coffee liqueurs. put over ice and dash with. thats it. no secret.\nby tony\nThis is my all time favourite drink & I think it taste the best with Tia Maria not Kohla! White Russian is alsoa favourite but because it is so easy to drink I tend to get very drunk on it :o) x\nby Helen Birch\nOk Vodka, Tia Maria & Coke, They are the ingredients. And its not coffee its chocolate, because the drink is otherwise known as a Chocolate Orgasm.\nby Kathryn Janeway\nthe ingredients here are wrong. it is vodka. tia maria,coke poured over ice and topped with a dash of guinness\nby damien\nAm i the only one who think this drink tastes like coffee?Great drink tho!\nby Flesh\nbest drink ever ! if i remember rightly , the ingredients were . . . . . tia maria , pepsi , the head of guiness & vodka ?\nby andy\nMust have a dash of Lime try it you'll be convert.\nby Angela\nThe only drink to enjoy. . . . .\nby Cherri MacD\nGreat - only long island tea is better - coke diffuses the flavours without weakening it - so do it with a splash of coke!\nby Fred Barff\nu gotta have a head of guiness for the ultimate 'irish black russian'!!\nby Ali\nonly wimps have coke in it!!!\nby DS\nThe original Black Russian in the 1970's used Tia Maria not Kahlua because Kahlua did not exist then.\nby C S\nSorry, but a Black Russian is Vodka and Kahlua, PERIOD. Proportions vary - with a stronger tasting voda (a la Stoly), 1-to-1 tend to be about right, but lighter vodkas, 2/1 vodka/Kahlua is btter. FORGET THE COLA, this drink is already sweet enough.\nby Joe in the US\nover here in ireland we top it off with guinness, anybody else do this around the world?\nby ladyskyline\nThe Big Debate: Traditional Black Russian is Kahlua and Vodka. If served in a pub, they add coke to make it go further. Tia Maria is NOT the same as Kahlua, the flavour is different - Kahlua is a stronger coffee flavour(see Notabikeranymore)Also, see White Russian\nby Tom Booze\nTia maria is basically the brand name for kahlua. Like smirnoff is for vodka\nby Notabikeranymore\nLeave the Vodka and Kahlua and remove the splash of coke. . . . . . . . no good with coke\nby J\nThought it was Tia Maria!\nby Deb\nGorgeous, tastes extra lovely with a Guiness top, as served in my local. *yum*\nby CharChar\nwell what can i say but if u want to get smashed in a lovely sinking way this is the one for you!\nby ian haley\nThis is one of my favorite drinks.\nby Jeff Gibbons\nBlack Russian is a great drink but COLA ahs NOTHING to do in it. Correct recipe is: 2/3 vodka, 1/3 Kahlua. Build into an ice-filled old-fashioned glass.\nby Pete\nNice with crushed ice too. in a long glass with plenty of coke\nby Caroline\nIt's a drink with a lot of taste that should be enjoyed slow but steady\nby Petter\n\n"
