Goliath Bird Eating Spider - Theraphosa blondi Goliath Bird Eating Spider - Theraphosa blondi\nGenus: Theraphosa\nSpecies: blondi\nThe Goliath                   bird-eating spider is, as its name suggests, large                   enough to eat a bird. This giant spider is found in                   the northern South American countries of Suriname,                   Brazil, Guyana and Venezuela. Its habitat is the                   wet swamps and marshy areas deep within the primary                   rainforest. The Goliath bird-eating spider was                   named by explorers from the Victorian era who first                   reported them to the western world, and witnessed                   one eating a humming bird.\nGoliath bird-eaters are the world's largest species of          tarantula. Tarantula is a generic name for hairy spiders.          This hairy spider has a leg span of 12 inches (30.5 cm)          across, or about the size of a dinner plate or small pizza,          and they can weigh 2.5 ounces (70 g). Their bodies are dark          and light brown in color. Like most spiders they lack          antennae and have four pairs of legs. Their bodies are made          up of two external parts; the cephalothorax, or head and          neck combined, and the abdomen. Their eyesight is weak even          though they have 8 eyes. They can only see differences in          the level of light. They rely instead on sensory hairs that          feel the slightest vibrations on the ground and in the air,          and allows them to detect movement.\nLike most          tarantulas, the Goliath-bird eater is a deep burrowing          species. They live in burrows in the ground dug by the          spiders themselves, or abandoned by rodents. The female          spends most of her life in her silk-lined burrow. They are          nocturnal spiders and don't travel more than a few feet from          home, resting in their burrows during the day.\nThe Goliath          bird-eating spider is a solitary arachnid, and only          associates with other spiders of its species when mating or          guarding its young. Males can be identified by the mating          hooks on the first set of legs. The male will come to the          entrance of the female's burrow and try to entice her out.          He will use his mating hooks when she comes out to restrain          her fangs while he tries to mate with her. Afterwards he has          to make a fast getaway or be injured or killed by the          female. About 50% of the males are killed or maimed while          trying to mate.\nThe female deposits          about 50 eggs in a silken egg sack about 1 inch (3 cm) in          diameter, and stores it in her burrow. She guards it for 6          to 7 weeks, even taking the sack with her when she leaves          the burrow. After the young spiders hatch they stay in the          nest until their first molt, and then go out on their          own.\nThe Goliath          bird-eating spiders are considered to be very aggressive and          do not make good pets. Unlike other spiders, who are          noiseless, the Goliath bird-eating spider can make a hissing          noise to frighten off threats by rubbing bristles on its          legs together. They will also rear up on their hind legs in          a threat position. Their two fangs have poison glands at          their base. Although they are not very toxic to humans, they          can cause severe pain, nausea and sweating. The venom works          on the nervous system and paralyzes its smaller victims. A          more painful way of defending itself is to flick off the          hairs on its abdomen with its legs. These microscopically          barbed hairs can be irritating to the skin and lungs. They          will cause swelling for a few hours like a nettle rash. It          is most serious when the hairs get into your eyes or          mouth.\nThe life expectancy          for a female Goliath bird eater is about 25 years. Most          require about 10 years to mature to adults. Males live for          only one year or less after mating. The spiders continue to          molt after reaching maturity and are able to regrow any          limbs they might lose.\nThe size and power          of the Goliath bird-eater makes it possible for them to eat          larger prey. They rarely eat birds, although they may eat          hatchlings. Its usual diet consists of frogs, small snakes,          beetles, insects, lizards and even bats and pinky rats. They          don't have any special hunting technique, like building webs          or leaping on their prey. They will sneak up on their prey          and pounce on their victim, injecting them with venom which          paralyzes them. They will often carry their prey back to          their burrow or a safe location to eat it at leisure. They          don't have teeth to tear or chew their food, but regurgitate          digestive juices onto their victim. The juices break down          the soft tissue making it possible for the spider to suck up          the liquid and eat its meal.\nAlthough it is not          threatened in the wild, it does have natural enemies like          certain spider wasps, some snakes, and other tarantulas. The          spiders are most vulnerable during molting when they are          fragile and can't move very well. Smaller insects can easily          kill a tarantula in the process of molting. It takes several          days for the exoskeleton to harden again. The most dangerous          enemy the spider has is man and the destruction of its          habitat.\n2003\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nIt's named after a guy called Datuk Chan Chew Lun and the fact that it ... There are spiders out there that can take ... What is the Biggest Insect in the World? Sea ... Real Monstrosities: What is the Biggest Insect in the World? Real Monstrosities: What is the Biggest Insect in the World?\nSunday, 4 March 2012\nWhat is the Biggest Insect in the World?\nYou gotta love insects, right? They're all over the place so if you don't want your life to be a solid mass of annoyance and fear you really ought to love 'em.\nAnd of course, the only thing better than an insect is a really big insect. And the only thing better than a really big insect is one so big it can bite a man's arm off and fly away with his car. That's my dream, anyway.\nIt will, unfortunately, have to remain a dream for now. I'm just gonna have to be satisfied with insects that can't quite remove limbs and don't often appear to want to either. I got scientists working on it, though. You might want to get on my good side while you still have the chance.\nBut we can't go around using words like \"biggest\". There are far too many ways of interpreting it. Let's get a little more precise...\nLongest\nThe world's longest insect is Chan's Megastick, Phobaeticus chani. A few museums have specimens in their collection and the longest of the lot is at the Natural History Museum, London. Their record breaker has a body length of 35.7 cm (14.1 in). Not bad. Not bad at all. In fact, that's pretty good.\nThe thing is, stick insects like to go that extra mile/few inches. They tend to stretch out those front legs to get a bit of twigginess in with the stickiness. If you include them, Chan's Megastick is now 56.7 cm (22.3 in)  long.\nIt's named after a guy called Datuk Chan Chew Lun and the fact that it's a really long stick. A \"megastick\", indeed. A \"megastick\". \"Megastick\"? Am I wrong, or is that word utterly ridiculous?\nApproximately nothing is known about it. It's thought to live high up in the canopy of rainforests in Borneo, making it even more difficult to find than usual. One of the specimens was carrying eggs and they had little wings on them! It seems that they're flicked away to catch the wind and glide off so the hatchlings can find a new tree to live in.\nFor my Insect Army, I will create the Zettastick . Stick Insects are herbivores, so I was thinking they'd be engineers creating living bridges for my hordes to cross into enemy and completely innocent territory. These flying eggs coupled with expert camouflage intrigue me, however...\nImage: Wikipedia\nWidest\nWith width we're talking wings and the White Witch of the west. It's Thysania agrippina, a huge owlet moth from Central and South America. They have the biggest wingspan of any insect, reaching about 30 cm (1 foot). It actually looks a lot like those little white moths you see commonly, it's just that it's HUGE so you really get to appreciate those intricate patterns.\nThey're bigger than your face , bigger than the container you brought to take them home in and bigger than most other moths . Sometimes they're even significantly bigger than their own picture !\nThey will look magnificent as they rain death upon my enemies and other people who I have no particular argument with. It shall be glorious.\nImage: Macreando via Flickr\nGreatest Surface Area\nAs far as I can tell, the Atlas Moth has the biggest surface area of any insect. It's those gigantic wings again.\nAttacus atlas is a large Saturniid moth, significantly larger than some Saturniids, only slightly larger than others. They come from Southeast Asia and are said to have a total wing surface area of more than 400 cm2 (62 sq in). Wow! The wingspan is a \"mere\" 26 cm (11.4 in) or so, but the more expansive shape gives them the edge over the White Witch.\nAnd of course, they're utterly beautiful. Their size helps us to take in those amazing colours as they bring joy to all . Aside from those uppermost wing-tips, that is. They're supposed to look like snakes. Whether this is because someone said \"hey, that looks like a snake\" or it was more \"hey, that predator ran away because it thought it was a snake\", I don't know.\nIt's not looking great for my army. They don't even like to fly much and the adults only live for a couple weeks anyway.\nAt least rationing won't be a problem; adult Atlas Moths don't eat. Nothing at all. They have poorly developed mouthparts so they must subsist on what they built up as a gluttonous caterpillar.\nImage: Deanster1983 via Flickr\nThese greedy caterpillars reach 11.5 cm (4.5 in) long before they pupate. They are armed with little spines that are covered in a waxy substance . I'm wondering if it's something similar to the stuff that nymphs of the Flatid Leaf Bug had. I presume it's a defence against birds and other predators. Even I think they look pretty juicy and I don't think about caterpillars in that way.\nAnd if that doesn't work they spray a load of stinking fluid up to a distance of 50 cm (19.7 in).\nNow we're talking! They shall be my artillery. Natural, organic, chemical warfare, because I CARE about this planet!\nHeaviest?\nNext is the world famous Giant Weta from New Zealand. Specifically it's the Little Barrier Island Giant Weta (Deinacrida heteracantha), so named because it now survives only on that small island. They used to exist on the mainland, too, but rats and cats did for this docile, little (massive) handful.\nIt's almost appropriate, in a way. Giant Wetas are an example of island gigantism, where something small grows big to take advantage of a gap in the ecosystem. In this case, crickets grew to some 10 cm body length so they could browse on vegetation and live the life of a mouse. Mice couldn't cross the water and get to New Zealand, crickets could; waste not want not, right?\nMost Giant Wetas seldom get heavier than 35g (1.2 oz), but they can sometimes double that and weigh more than a sparrow! A big complication here is that this is at least sometimes females holding on to huge numbers of eggs. Maybe even abnormal numbers of eggs. They're just bulging and bursting with eggs! They end up weighing over 70 g (2.5 oz) and some people get impressed, others don't .\nThe problem for my war effort is that they are just too friendly . They can't even jump any more and they don't fly. They can bite but they don't do it often, though their legs are covered in spines that can inflict scratches. I think I'll have to change them up a little so they can become my stormtroopers. Jump in there, smash up the target and get out. May as well add some laser eyes. You can't make an omelette without laser eyes, right?\nHeaviest?\nThe Giant Weta was an adult, but what about larva? Yes, even heavier than any known adult is the greedy grub of a Goliath Beetle called Goliathus goliatus . These things can get over 10 cm (4 in) long and weigh over 115 grams (4.1 oz). They live in the soil in parts of Africa and are armed with claws at the end of their legs and a strong bite.\nRemarkably little is known about the life and times of a Goliath Beetle larva. Even people who breed them  can only say they require a protein-rich diet and may recommend cat food. Cat food! In the wild they might be predatory, or perhaps they're opportunistic and eat pretty much anything. Breeders do note them being a little cannibalistic.\nQuite the military asset! Finally, someone who will wantonly eat anyone who happens to get within reach of their pulsating, fleshy body. It's just what I've always wanted!\nJust as with those moths, several months of pure eating is devoted to the emergence of an adult after pupation. In this case it's a beetle. A gigantic beetle.\n\n"
