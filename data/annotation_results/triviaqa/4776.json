        "\nDOCUMENT 1:\n\nHilda loved the house and quickly found a job as cleaner at the Rovers Return, ... she was still the same old Hilda Ogden ... plus her own flat in his house. Now ... Hilda Ogden - Coronation Street Wiki - Wikia Hilda Ogden | Coronation Street Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nJean Alexander\nHilda Alice Ogden (née Crabtree) was a resident of 13 Coronation Street from 1964 to 1987 . The devoted wife of Stan , Hilda and her husband were the roughnecks of Coronation Street and had frequent clashes with their neighbours.\nHilda and Stan were life's losers. Due to Stan's drunken rages, two of their children - Tony and Sylvia - were taken into council care, and their other two children - Irma and Trevor - ran away from home. They lived on the breadline, with Hilda holding up to five charing jobs at once just to keep the house going, compensating for Stan who ducked out of work whenever possible to drink and laze around. No one knew Stan's flaws better than Hilda, who often had to nag him out to work, but for the most part she doted on him and defended him vehemently against his detractors.\nExcept for the rare social occasions, Hilda wore her hair in curlers and a headscarf. She was the Street's principal gossip and revelled in spreading it around, particularly if it could cause trouble. As a result, she had no real friends in the Street, and the neighbours treated her and Stan like a joke - a matter which greatly upset Hilda. As part of her continuing quest to gain the respect and envy of the neighbours, Hilda erected a mural on No.13's parlour wall. She also considered herself a skilled clairvoyant, and offered teacup readings for a fee.\nHilda was widowed when Stan died from a heart attack in 1984 . She lived at No.13 for three more years, taking in Kevin Webster as her lodger in May 1985 , and his girlfriend Sally Seddon in the following May . They married in October 1986 , and stayed on as lodgers at No.13 until December 1987 , when Hilda decided to move to Derbyshire to keep house for Doctor Lowther , whose wife had died only a few weeks previously from injuries sustained in a robbery that went wrong. He offered her accommodation in a cottage attached to his home.\nJust before leaving Weatherfield for good, Hilda sold No.13 to the Websters at a generously low price, so they had somewhere to live without having to leave the neighbourhood.\nContents\nHilda Alice Crabtree was born to Arnold and Florence Crabtree of Silk Street , Weatherfield on 2nd February 1924 . She was the youngest of three, after Norman and Archie .\nThe Crabtrees never got rich from Arnold's earnings from his work as an embalmer, and Hilda spent her youth moving from one slum to another. Worst of all was Back Butler Street , although even in those circumstances Florence kept a good house and the fumigation crew never descended on the Crabtree household.\nHilda was educated at St. Joseph's Elementary School and left at fifteen, entering the working world just as war broke out in Europe. At seventeen, Hilda spent a week working in the office at Spencers, the funeral director. For most of the war she worked in a munitions factory, while living with her parents in Kitchener Street , but still found the time to have fun with her friends Daisy Shaw , Mollie Lancaster , and Maureen Hegerty , and even had a romance with American GI Ralph Curtis .\nOn one night in 1943 , after helping her inebriated Army boyfriend Harry Battersby home following an evening's drinking at the Tripe Dressers Arms , the lights went out, stranding Hilda a mile from home. Racing to the nearest shelter in Crimea Street , Hilda passed the Co-op where she tripped over what she took to be a bundle of clothes - until it started moving, and Hilda found herself entangled with a beer-sodden tramp. Stanley Ogden had just left the Docker's Arms after winning the pint drinking contest for the fifth year running and was recuperating in a heap when Hilda fell over him. Though he'd taken a kick in the stomach, Stan helped the mystery woman to her feet, and Hilda reciprocated, getting a darkened glimpse of a man who had a look of Clark Gable about him. After limping along to the shelter, Hilda was thrilled to see Stan trailing her - but as the light hit him, he looked more English lout than Hollywood superstar. Even so, Hilda's head had been turned, and she spent the night in the shelter talking away to him.\nSix short days later, the star-crossed lovers were married. After the ceremony, the couple headed for the Spinners' Arms , where Stan resumed his pint, and their reception took place. The event was a great success - until Joan Fairhurst walked in and announced that the groom was her fiancé. Best man Bernie Sparks saved the day by proposing to Joan himself. Their first night of married bliss was barely behind them when the military police knocked on the door to arrest Stan for over-staying his four-day leave. The Ogden marriage had begun in earnest.\n1943-1964: A long-distance marriage\nOn marrying Stan, Hilda moved into his parents' house in Mare Street . Mary Ogden approved of her, and, when Hilda announced her pregnancy, she pampered her daughter-in-law. Hilda then found that she wasn't pregnant after all, but didn't tell Mary, who threw Hilda out when she discovered the truth. Hilda rented 17 Charles Street and waited for her Stan to come home.\nWhile working with the Army, Stan gained an HGV licence and after being demobbed, he became a long-distance lorry driver, stopping by Weatherfield so rarely that it was as if he'd never returned from the war. Hilda became a career cleaner, supporting single-handedly a family that seemed to gain an extra member whenever Stan visited; eldest, Freda , born in 1946 , was followed by Dudley , Tony , and Sylvia . Hilda's faith in her husband never wavered, but he didn't send on enough money for the family to get by, and they often had no money for rent, resulting in many a moonlight flit. Hilda coped gamely on her own with Freda and Dudley, but Tony and Sylvia were mentally retarded, and with the extra problem of Stan being drunk and violent to her and the kids whenever he was around, Hilda was relieved when their younger children were taken off them and placed in a home.\nBy the 1960s , Hilda was sick of having a long-distance husband and demanded that Stan give up his job or she'd leave him. Meanwhile, Freda decided she'd had enough of her parents and, at seventeen, she left their Chapel Street home to live in a flat over a pie shop with barmaid Marion Black , got a job at the Corner Shop in Coronation Street , and changed her name to Irma. Estrangement from Freda encouraged Hilda to make good on her threat to Stan, and after a brief separation he gave in and agreed to get a local job and unite the Ogdens under one roof.\n1964-1968: Arrival at number thirteen\n1964 : Hilda and Stan join Irma in Coronation Street\nIn July 1964 , Stan sent word to Hilda that he'd found Irma and a house - 13 Coronation Street . Putting his £200 savings down, Stan took out a £350 mortgage on the house, and the Ogdens moved to Coronation Street - their first real home.\nHilda loved the house and quickly found a job as cleaner at the Rovers Return , but regular work eluded Stan, and Irma soon regretted giving up her independence to live with her parents again. However, it was Dudley (now called Trevor) who left the family home first; while the Street residents were evacuated to the mission cellar during a bomb scare, the fifteen-year-old stole from the houses and ran off to London . Due to their shame, Stan and Hilda took no steps to trace him, although Hilda laid into Stan for being such a poor father figure and role model. A year later, Irma married David Barlow they bought the Corner Shop together. With a wall between them, Irma's relationship with her parents improved.\nThe only problem now was Stan. By turn a milkman, ice cream vendor, chauffeur, wrestler, and waste paper businessman, Stan failed in every line of work he entered. Stan was willing to try his hand at anything that promised to make him rich with little effort, but his total resistance to hard graft meant that he never lasted long. Hilda often had to nag him out to work, even if he usually only made it as far as the Rovers, which had become his second home.\nWith Stan's bone-idleness, and Hilda's assumed position as the Street gossip, the Ogdens were treated like a joke by the neighbours, and they struggled to make friends. After a while, Hilda began to fear she'd spend the rest of her life skivvying and, looking to the recent engagement of Elsie Tanner - a woman she disparaged in public - began to envy her eventful, exciting life, and became depressed and vague. While on a visit to her cousins', Hilda went missing. As she had the club outing money with her, Stan thought it was a pre-planned flit and that a man was involved, but after a week's absence Hilda was found on the Pier head in Liverpool in a confused state, having suffered a nervous breakdown. Doctor McKenzie diagnosed paranoid psychosis, attributed to jealousy over Elsie. Although Hilda didn't remember anything when she woke, Stan came through for her in the ensuing weeks, being the attentive husband he'd never been.\nIn January 1968 , Hilda developed a platonic friendship with George Greenwood , keeper of Oakenshaw Park where she often went for a walk. George showed Hilda his workhut and introduced her to his budgie, Winston, and even gave her her own budgie, which she called Mabel and kept in the hut with Winston. Though there was nothing untoward about their meetings, Hilda felt that she was somehow betraying Stan, and told George she couldn't see him again. Unbeknown to Hilda, Stan had been notified that they were seeing each other by George's wife Agnes , and advised to make the most of Hilda's guilt by getting her to spoil him.\n1968 : Hilda is upset as Irma flies the nest\nA few months later, David and Irma decided to emigrate to Australia so that David could relaunch his football career there. Hilda was so distraught at losing Irma that she proposed that she and Stan move there too, but Stan's absolute refusal to leave England caused her to back down. A small consolation came seven months later, when the Barlows announced the birth of Darren , Hilda and Stan's first grandson.\n1968-1971: Irma returns\nIn June that year, Stan bought I-spy Dwyer 's window cleaning round for £45. Hilda was so approving that she agreed to help out, taking responsibility for Stan's lady customers who might take a fancy to him. One woman in particular was Clara Regan of 19 Inkerman Street , whose affair with Stan was the worst kept secret in Weatherfield. Hilda believed Stan was faithful, and soon left his business to him, but Stan servicing 19 Inkerman Street's windows was the butt of many jokes from the likes of Ray Langton and Billy Walker for years to come.\nThe Ogdens continued to struggle financially. In 1969 , Stan traded in his round for a car park attendant's position, and early in 1970 Hilda took on an extra cleaning job at Alan Howard's Salon .\n1970 : What is Dave Smith 's interest in Irma ? Hilda tries to protect her daughter\nA few months later, Ken Barlow broke the news that Irma, David and Darren had been involved in a car crash. Irma was treated for shock but was otherwise fine, however both her husband and son died from their injuries. Hilda rushed to her daughter's side, with Stan borrowing £600 from bookie Dave Smith to pay for her flights - her first journey abroad. A week later, Hilda and Irma returned to the UK, by which time the Ogdens had received enough money from well-wishers to pay Dave back. However, in a misguided gesture of love for his daughter, Stan used the money to buy Irma into the Corner Shop . In the wake of David and Darren's deaths, Irma acted out in odd ways, and at one point dated Dave Smith. When Hilda objected, Stan informed her that as security for the loan, he'd signed their house over to Dave, and so she'd better not upset him. That, plus the prospect of having a wealthy son-in-law caused Hilda to change her tune, but in any case Irma and Dave's relationship was casual and mostly for show.\nHilda enjoyed having Irma back in the Street and she would often linger in the shop to complain about Stan or eavesdrop on conversations. Irma remained in the Street until December 1971 , when she moved to Llandudno and sold her share in the shop. Irma's departure coincided with the Ogdens finally settling their debt with Dave; after Hilda won £500 on Premium Bonds, Stan insisted on on paying Dave the £370 still owed, making No.13 unequivocally theirs again. Determined to treat herself with the remaining £95, Hilda bought a coffee percolator, a tray, a table centre, a cocktail bar and an electric tooth brush on a shopping spree, and threw a cocktail party, only to discover that Stan had drunk all the miniatures and filled the bottles with cold tea!\n1971-1974: Reconciliation with Trevor\nIn July that year, Hilda was reunited with her old friend George Greenwood, who was on the judging panel at the Community Centre flower show. Thinking they were bound to win, Stan stole an orchid from the park and passed it off as theirs - but George immediately recognised one from his collection, much to Hilda's shame.\n1971 : Stan unveils the serving hatch to a thrilled Hilda\nMuch derided by the neighbours, Hilda yearned to be envied by them. In August , she took delivery of a colour television set, and spent the next week enthusing about it to all and sundry before it was repossessed by the rental company (all the while failing to notice everyone's total disinterest). The following month, while Hilda was away, Stan made a serving hatch. It was too big and on the wrong wall, but finally No.13 was set apart from its neighbours in a good way, and so Hilda couldn't have been happier.\nIn April 1972 , after two years working for Fairclough and Langton , Stan returned to the lorries, but after a crash put him in hospital, Hilda decided his days of lorry driving were over and made him start up his window cleaning round again. Meanwhile, with the Ogdens feeling the pinch, Hilda took on additional work - alongside her job at the Rovers, she cleaned the Betting Shop as well as Benny Lewis 's flat and The Capricorn nightclub, where she also did the washing up. With Hilda doing so much, Stan felt free to retire - but Hilda wasn't going to let him off that lightly, and made him do all of the housework. Stan actually showed promise early on but within days Alan Howard sacked Hilda from the Capricorn for gossiping about him and Rita Littlewood , and normal service was resumed.\n1973 : Hilda and Stan get a cool reception when they turn up on Trevor and Polly 's doorstep\nA year later, the Ogdens celebrated their pearl wedding anniversary with a party at No.13. As Hilda lorded it over the neighbours, gloating to Betty Turpin about Elsie Howard's recent family troubles, Betty snappily reminded her of her estrangement from Trevor. Betty's comments hit home; letting Trevor slip away was one of Hilda's biggest regrets. Stan still held a grudge against his son, but Hilda was determined to track him down. Using a letter sent to them by Trevor two years earlier, the Ogdens found Trevor living in a detached house in Avondale Avenue, Chesterfield , having worked his way up from a wood yard to become an estate agent. Now the husband of Polly and father of Damian , Trevor was embarrassed by his parents and warned Polly that they would try to sponge off them. Hopeful of building a relationship with the family, Hilda put on a front, trying not to appear common, but Stan showed only contempt for Trevor, and when Polly let slip that Trevor had told her that his parents were dead, Hilda was so upset that she and Stan left.\nAfterwards, Trevor occasionally let the Ogdens see Damian, at his and Polly's convenience. Keen to prove her worth to Trevor, Hilda got an interview for the Kabin to replace Mavis Riley as Rita's assistant. Given a trial by Len Fairclough , Hilda ordered Stan to come in as a customer, carefully planning a scene which would show Rita how efficient she was, but Stan spent the money in the Rovers instead and rolled up to the Kabin blind drunk, where he giggled and said he'd forgotten what Hilda told him to say. In the end, Lucille Hewitt got the job.\n1974-1976: Getting away from it all\nIn desperate need of a break, Hilda took a six-week cleaning job on a cruise ship, the Monte Umber . Not long after she returned, the Ogdens were offered a caretakership at the Community Centre , a post they'd previously applied for but lost out to Gertie Robson . Thinking their luck was finally changing, Hilda quit the Rovers and sold No.13 to Jimmy Graham for £2,500, however at the last minute the Bishops told them they didn't have the jobs due to their poor record with the health inspector. The Ogdens called off the deal with Jimmy, and Hilda wept as her dreams were shattered once again - although she managed to get her Rovers job back with a pay rise.\nNow in her fifties, Hilda was worn out and increasingly dissatisfied with No.13. As the 1970s wore on, the Ogdens' usual troubles were exacerbated by economic recession and Stan's failing health - which meant that Hilda had to work even more. In 1975 , Stan became so ill that he went off beer and, forced out to work by Hilda who thought he was trying to skive, he collapsed in the street. While he was on the sick, the Ogdens received only £7.65 benefit for his incapacity as Stan hadn't paid his National Insurance for six months, so to make ends meet Hilda took on an extra job doing the washing up at the Mark Brittain Warehouse and did Stan's round, with the help of Eddie Yeats .\n1976 : Hilda shows off her \"muriel\" to Annie Walker and Bet Lynch\nNewly released from Walton Jail , Eddie Yeats vowed never to return and kept his nose clean. Lazy and workshy, he found a kindred spirit in Stan, and frequently called at No.13 to cadge a free dinner or coax Stan out for a drink (not that he had to try very hard). In July 1976 , he offered to help Hilda decorate No.13's parlour by getting her half-price wallpaper from a mate, in exchange for lodgings in the Ogdens' spare room. However, half of the wallpaper Eddie brought faded with only three walls covered. For the last wall, after a few suggestions which Hilda rejected, Eddie supplied a special wallpaper which created a mural of the Canadian Rockies. The \"muriel\" was everything Hilda wanted - looking at it, she could imagine herself in more picturesque surroundings, and as no one else had one, No.13 gained prestige. She immediately fell in love with it.\nTowards the end of the year, Hilda fell into a slump again. In October , when swerving her car to avoid hitting a dog, Annie Walker slammed into Stan's cart, putting him out of work again until a sympathetic Len, Ray and Terry Bradshaw made him a new one. A few weeks later, Hilda's missing red mac turned up on a bonfire guy which two young boys were pushing around. When they came into the Rovers, the regulars noticed Hilda's mac and roared with laughter, humiliating her. To cheer his wife up, Stan bought the mac back from the boys for 10p, but Hilda refused to wear it and decided to treat herself to a new one. Dipping into her Christmas money, Hilda was furious to find that Stan had already taken half of it. At the end of her tether, she launched into a tirade at Stan, telling him she wished she'd never met him, and threw him out.\n1976 : Hilda fetches Stan from Norman 's chip shop, fearing Edie Blundell has designs on him\nAfter a few hours, Hilda calmed down and awaited her husband's return. However, days went by with no sign of him. After a week, Hilda started to fear the worst and confided in Annie, who rang the police to report him missing. Her fears were put to rest when her brother Norman called round to complain about Stan imposing on him at his Oakhill chip shop. With Hilda refusing to beg Stan to return, and Stan being looked after by assistant Edie Blundell , Eddie decided to intervene but inadvertently made matters worse by telling Stan that Hilda wanted an apology from him; Hilda's outburst had hurt Stan deeply and he felt that he was owed an apology. After hearing about Edie, Hilda went to fetch Stan herself, and got into a slanging match with Edie and Norman, with Stan stepping up to defend his wife. Thrown out of the shop by Norman, the Ogdens realised that, for better or worse, they belonged together, and life at No.13 returned to normal.\n1977-1980: Battles at the factory\nIn May 1977 , Hilda was taken on as cleaner at the recently-opened Baldwin's Casuals , working evenings. Out of curiosity, Hilda had a go on one of the sewing machines and, discovering a knack for it, made herself denim cleaning mittens from offcuts after finishing her cleaning duties. Thinking she was onto a winner, Eddie persuaded Hilda to go into partnership with him making curtains, with Eddie supplying the material, but Mike Baldwin soon caught her making curtains on his time and put a stop to it.\nThe extra wage made life a little easier for the Ogdens, and Hilda was excited at the thought that they might be able to afford to move. When the Langtons moved, Hilda wanted to buy No.5 , the most modern house in the street, but they were beaten to the punch by the Tilsleys .\n1978 : Hilda and Ralph Curtis jive\nIn May 1978 , Hilda received a letter from her American flame, Ralph Curtis, who was in the country and wanted to meet up with her. Hilda was unsure about seeing him again as it had been so long, but Renee Roberts pushed her into calling his hotel from the Corner Shop , and he arranged to visit the house. Once Ralph arrived, time fell away and Hilda enjoyed his visit immensely. With the same boundless energy and enthusiasm she remembered, Ralph was quite a contrast to Stan and Hilda couldn't help wondering what might have been.\nHilda was used to working without support or solidarity. When she asked for a new broom for her factory work, Mike accused Hilda of cutting up her broom and sacked her. Hilda was stunned when Ivy Tilsley led the girls out on strike in sympathy, a strike not backed by the union due to Hilda not being a member. Surprisingly, Hilda herself wasn't bothered by the sacking and walked into a new job cleaning the offices at the abbatoir, leaving the picket line to work. However, when Mike backed down and agreed to reinstate her, Hilda quit her new job for fear of what the girls would do if they knew.\nTwo years later, Hilda was the source of another factory row. Thrown out of the pools syndicate by Vera Duckworth for missing a week, Hilda got revenge by copying the winning pools numbers onto the factory girls' copy, to make Vera think she'd won a little money. However, she messed up and the factory girls celebrated a win of thousands. Hilda was too afraid to tell the girls the truth, but confessed to Mike when the girls found out they hadn't won and blamed the error on Martin Cheveski . Eager for a peaceful solution, Mike broke the news to the girls and threatened to fire anyone who touched Hilda. The girls responded by sending Hilda to Coventry, leaving Mike with no choice but to sack her. The situation upset Hilda so much that she went to stay with Trevor for a while. In her absence, Vera exacted revenge by tipping off Johnny Webb 's wife Maureen Webb that Hilda was her husband's mistress (in reality, Stan was letting him lodge at No.13 while Hilda was away). Maureen had a public slanging match with Hilda, but backed down when she saw the size of Stan.\n1980-1984: Stan's final years\nEddie Yeats lived with Hilda and Stan from 1980 to 1983\nIn July , Hilda offered a homeless Eddie the Ogdens' front bedroom for £20 a week, satisfied that he could pay his way as he'd finally got a full-time job on the bins after four years on the dole.\nHilda bounced back from the factory fiasco by getting a job cleaning No.9 for Len and Rita . As a Christmas treat for herself, she hired Mrs Palin as a regular cleaner for No.13 at £1.75 an hour, but had to reluctantly let her go after a few weeks as they could no longer afford her. She carried on working for the Faircloughs until September 1981 , when she got an interview for a cleaning job at a businessman's flat , which turned out to be Mike's. Mike took Hilda on, feeling that she was honest and trustworthy. On her first day, Hilda accidentally set off the burglar alarm, attracting the attention of a police officer, who questioned Hilda and sent for Mike. Hilda was relieved when Mike laughed it off.\nAfter visiting her brother Archie's plush new home, Hilda's thirst for a change of scenery was reawakened, and she began looking at show homes. The Ogdens decided to buy a house in River Park Estate for £17,000 and put the house up for sale, but they were denied a mortgage as Stan didn't earn enough. They were tempted to accept an offer from the Bells of £7,500 cash for No.13 and try for a council house, but after a warning from Elsie that the road was in a rough area, Hilda returned the Bells' cheque and took the house off the market. Stan too fancied a change; with another harsh winter coming up, Stan put his round up for sale and decided to take early retirement, only for Hilda to answer the ad (planning to buy the round for Stan) and read him the riot act!\nIn October 1982 , Hilda realised a long-held ambition to clean a big house when she was taken on by Doctor and Mrs Lowther at Goldenhurst , Oakfield Drive . Finding the house and the owners a delight, Hilda didn't mind the extra work.\n1983 was a big year for the Ogdens. In February , money lender Syd Kippax got onto Hilda about £185 Stan owed him, giving him 24 hours to pay up. Hilda was confused as Stan had been giving her money for housekeeping, but under questioning he admitted that he'd been borrowing money to hand in instead of working as was no longer able to climb ladders in bad weather. Fortunately Eddie came to the rescue by buying the round for £185 and getting Stan to work for him. Hilda supported Stan throughout, admiring his determination to go on working.\nA few months later, Hilda was saddened when her brother Archie passed away from a heart attack. As his only surviving family, she stood to inherit Archie's chip shop , however after his death his assistant Avril Carter also put in a claim for the shop, telling Hilda that she was Archie's fiancée and that with his dying breath he had expressed his desire for her to have the shop. Hilda battled Avril for the shop and, after finding out Avril was having an affair with a married man which would be exposed in court, forced her to drop her claim. Hilda's victory came with a sting in the tale; due to Archie's debts her inheritance came to £1,583, and she had to sell the shop after the landlord, Mr Holt , put the rent up. Hilda opened a bank account for the first time and celebrated by booking an expensive French restaurant for a meal, threatening to strangle Stan if he ruined the evening for her. Not understanding the French menu, the Ogdens ordered melon and sea bass and had an enjoyable time.\nThe year had a happy but bittersweet ending as Eddie left No.13 to marry Marion Willis , with Hilda standing in for his mother. The Yeats moved to Bury just after the Ogdens celebrated their Ruby wedding anniversary with a party in the Rovers select.\n1984 : Hilda is left alone\nIn 1984 , Stan turned sixty-five and started drawing his pension. For health reasons, he had given up work a few months earlier, and by the latter half of the year he was permanently bed-ridden. Hilda was run ragged looking after him, collapsing at home, and later broke down at No.13 when Billy Walker called to have a go at her for failing to turn in. In November , Doctor Meakin arranged for an ambulance to take Stan into hospital for tests. He'd been there for a few days when the hospital phoned Hilda, via the Corner Shop, to tell her that Stan had died. The neighbours rallied round Hilda in the wake of Stan's death, with Trevor arriving to support her at the funeral. Although Trevor suggested a cheap cremation, Hilda insisted on a burial as she wanted a plot with room for her when she died. After being strong for Stan at the funeral, Hilda mourned for her husband privately, the grief and loss hitting her as she looked through Stan's effects from the hospital.\n1985-1998: Life after Stan\nHilda returned to work immediately after the funeral, sick of moping around in the empty house.\nSince moving in, she'd been against having lodgers, but the quietness plus fond memories of Eddie saw her reverse her position. Terry Duckworth stayed at No.13 for a few months in 1984, followed by railway ticket collector Henry Wakefield in January 1985 . Shortly after he moved in, Hilda found out from Curly Watts that Henry was actually unemployed; Henry admitted that he couldn't get a work as he was known by the unions as a strike breaker. He offered to leave, but Hilda felt sorry for him and got Mike to give him a job as a van driver at the factory. However, the girls soon found out he was a strike breaker and threatened to walk out. Mike ignored the threat but Henry took their comments to heart and resigned, leaving his lodgings at the same time. Hilda was upset to see Henry go as she'd enjoyed his company.\nIn July , Hilda was targetted by corrupt builder Les Pringle . When Alf Roberts decided to modernise the Corner Shop, he planned the expansion with Les, and asked Hilda if she'd be willing to sell him No.13. Hilda didn't want to go, but agreed to sell for £14,000 when Les told her the house's roof was sagging and could bring the house down. However, the guilt preyed on her mind and before the sale went through she told Alf about the roof. Inspecting it, Alf discovered the roof was fine and pulled out for Hilda's sake.\nThat summer, Kevin Webster left his lodgings at No.3 , finding landlady Emily Bishop too strict, and moved into No.13 at Terry's recommendation. Kevin found Hilda more fun and easygoing, while Hilda found Kevin polite and respectable, so they got on well. However, they had a minor falling out when Kevin started dating Sally Seddon ; Hilda knew the Seddons were a rough family and asked Terry and Curly to get Kevin away from Sally, but after a few months she accepted that Sally wasn't like her parents and even took her in when she discovered her father Eddie Seddon was abusive and took all of her earnings.\nLater that year, Kevin and Sally got married and moved into the Corner Shop flat . Hilda met and started a friendship with Sally's uncle Tom Hopwood . In 1987 , Tom decided to retire and asked Hilda to marry him and move to a bungalow in Formby with him. Hilda was stunned by the proposal, as she'd only ever seen Tom as a friend, and as such she told him she couldn't marry him; she was still Stan's wife, even in death.\n1987 : On Christmas Day , the residents say a fond farewell to Hilda\nIn November , Mike sacked Hilda when she tried to advise him about his and Susan 's marriage breakup. At the same time, the Lowthers decided to retire to Hartington , much to Hilda's disappointment, although Joan Lowther offered to recommend Hilda as a cleaner to the house's new owners. While they were packing, Hilda and Joan were attacked by burglars and Joan received a bump on the head. Although Hilda made a full recovery physically, Joan died from her injuries, and a stunned Hilda became withdrawn and afraid to be in her own home. The grieving Dr. Lowther decided not to change his plans to retire, and asked Hilda to keep house for him and live in a flat attached to the cottage. Hilda immediately accepted, and started planning her move away from Coronation Street after 23 years, selling No.13 to Kevin and Sally at a generously low price. Her last full day in Weatherfield was Christmas Day, which she spent with the Websters at No.13, reflecting on days gone by. Calling to say goodbye at the Rovers, she was thrilled to find a surprise party waiting for her, showing Hilda how loved she was in Coronation Street when she thought they'd be glad to see the back of her. For the first time ever, Hilda had a captive audience as she led the residents in a chorus of Wish Me Luck as You Wave Me Goodbye.\nHilda's only subsequent visit to Coronation Street was in 1990 , when she called in at the Rovers on her way to Stan's grave. She was disappointed when no one was around to see her arrive in style in a taxi, but milked every moment when her former neighbours listened keenly as she revealed the latest developments in her life, including a proposal of marriage by Dr. Lowther - although, of course, she left them guessing what her answer would be. Later, at Stan's grave, Hilda told her late husband that she wouldn't be marrying Dr. Lowther and she would always remain an Ogden. Between 1996 and 1998, Dr Lowther died, leaving his house to Hilda.\nHilda as she appeared in 1998\nAs of 1998 , Hilda still lived in Derbyshire , where she occasionally received a visit from Betty Williams . On one such visit, Hilda and Betty reminisced about their old friends and neighbours in Coronation Street. As Betty reported the latest goings-on, Hilda listened eagerly; over ten years and many miles removed from her old life, she was still the same old Hilda Ogden of number thirteen.\nPersonality\n\"They'll put that on me gravestone, won't they? 'She didn't look much, or weigh much, she didn't expect much, but she always managed.'\"\nHilda keeps the residents informed of the latest goings-on\nHilda was a tough working-class Northern woman. A loyal wife, she spent four decades working herself to the bone to make up for Stan 's shortcomings. Hilda's life was about somehow making ends meet in a world which seemed to have it in for the Ogdens. She was a naturally boisterous woman; fun and outgoing, she spent all her spare pennies on brightening up her life. She was also wistful, talking constantly about her hopes and dreams with genuine enthusiasm - until she looked at Stan and was brought back to grim reality.\nThough immensely unlucky, the Ogdens' misfortunes couldn't be wholly blamed on that; more often, it was Stan's idiocy or Hilda's gossiping that was to blame. The local busybody, Hilda knew everything about everyone, and spread the latest news with relish, particularly to those who would not enjoy hearing it. Hilda used gossip to pour scorn on people such as Elsie Tanner , reminding people of the more scandalous moments from their past at the least opportune moments in order to judge and hurt. She also delivered news like a brick; for example, when the police were about to inform Emily Bishop that her husband Ernie had been seriously injured by a shotgun blast, Hilda insensitively blurted out \"she's the wife!\"\nHilda's attempts to stir things up were always seen for what they were, earning her little to no friends in the Street and making her the object of ridicule. However, Hilda herself denied being a gossip and claimed to be the soul of discretion. She knew her limits, and chose her battles. When she had a beef with someone, Hilda was similarly unsubtle, hurling accusations with a voice like breaking glass, but always easily put in her place with a quip from her more restrained opponent. Even so, she managed to avoid being completely alienated from her neighbours, as her pettiness was seen as unthreatening and many felt sorry for her and Stan.\nHilda's judgementalism hid a deep envy of her neighbours, and she was desperate to be seen as just as good as the rest. She took any opportunity to show off, and would often fake an understanding of art or culture in a transparent attempt to earn their admiration, and in a similar vein, she often made malapropisms resulting in much hilarity. She also had an old-fashioned moral code, believing strongly that only married couples should have sex.\nTraits\nHilda was a short woman with a thin, sparrow-like frame. For most of the day, she totted about Coronation Street in her old red (later blue) mackintosh, clad in the same pinny and green headscarf she worked in, with her hair in rollers. For evenings, she took her rollers out, with just a dab of lipstick.\nRelationships\n1976 : Norman Crabtree with his sister Hilda\nHilda had great affection for her family and upbringing, and would sometimes refer to herself as a Crabtree. However, references and visits to individual family members were rarer. In March 1966 , Stan sold a framed photograph of Hilda's mother Florence to Jed Stone for his \"Viaduct Bargain Boutique\", resulting in a furious Hilda snatching it back.\nAs adults, Hilda and her brothers Norman and Archie lived a stone's throw from each other in Weatherfield but all led separate and very different lives. With his own chip shop in Oakhill , Norman was the most successful. His only interaction with Hilda during her time in Coronation Street was in 1976 , when Stan took root in the shop after a row with Hilda. Annoyed at being involved, Norman tried to get Stan and Hilda back together - but more for his own sake than theirs.\nHilda seemed closer to Archie. His only visit to 13 Coronation Street was in May 1972 , while Stan was in hospital. With his beer belly and laziness, Archie could more easily pass as Stan's brother than Hilda's, and for three weeks, Archie filled Stan's void in Hilda's life. Archie built a porch for Hilda but it was only when they were admiring the completed porch that Jerry Booth reminded them that they would need planning permission. The debacle ended with the mysterious disappearance of the porch, after Hilda was told by Councillor Warburton to take it down. When news came through that Stan was due to come home, Hilda told Archie to leave, none too impressed with his suggestion that she take on another job and look after both of them.\nHilda occasionally went to visit Archie, particularly when his circumstances improved in the early 1980s , with Archie marrying Doris and becoming the owner of Crabtree's Chip Shop . After his death in 1983 , Hilda inherited the shop, his money, and also, sadly, his considerable debts.\nStan Ogden\nHilda and Stan get ready to take on the world\n\"I suppose.\"\n\"I suppose. I suppose. That's your problem Stanley, you're too damn suppository. Now go out and insert y'self!\"\nHilda's entire life with Stan was encapsulated in their first week together in 1943 . In a story she would often repeat, she fell over an inebriated Stan in a blackout, and six days later he married her - but not, as she hoped, out of romantic gallantry, but because he was on the run from the military police for being AWOL.\nHilda was raised with traditional beliefs about marriage and a wife's duty to her husband. While her total responsibility for the house and children wasn't unusual, Hilda also tried to be a loyal and obedient wife to Stan, particularly in the early years of their marriage where Stan dominated Hilda with his abusiveness and drunken rages, which Hilda once told a shocked Concepta Hewitt she didn't mind. In January 1966 , Hilda filled out the winning pool numbers for Stan to check against his and, thinking they were his numbers, he celebrated an estimated £75,000 win by buying drinks all round at the Rovers . When a terrified Hilda told him the truth, Stan went berserk and chased her round the house.\nStan was a man of simple pleasures, sending little money to Hilda and drinking the rest away. For the family to survive, Hilda had to become everything he wasn't: tough, resourceful, and driven. When they moved to Coronation Street , it was up to Hilda to motivate her oaf of a husband out to work, and her nagging, piercing voice was enough to drive anyone out the door. Hilda constantly criticised Stan, attributing most of their financial woes to his uselessness. However, when he showed ambition, even for something bizarre such as scrap art ( September 1969 ) or songwriting ( February 1970 ), Hilda beamed with pride, believing in her husband's hidden talents.\nAnother drawback to being married to Stan was his inattentiveness. He was incapable of making a romantic gesture off his own back; the first time he sent Hilda a Valentine's card was in 1982 , when they'd been married for 38 years, and he only did so out of guilt over forgetting Hilda's birthday. Hilda was so flabbergasted that she refused to believe it was from Stan, preferring the notion that she had a secret admirer.\nStan was poor at predicting his wife's needs, particularly her need to be treated like a woman, and he often showed her up in public. His understanding of his wife was so lacking that in 1981 , they came last place in a \"Mr and Mrs\" competition in the Rovers, with Stan giving three embarrassing (and, to the audience, hilarious) answers. To avoid bother, Stan would often risk making matters even worse, such as in May 1967 when he burned Hilda's London cup final ticket so he wouldn't have to admit he'd sold his and couldn't get it back. To keep up the pretext, he spent the day on a park bench, but of course Hilda found out anyway and made him paint the house as a penance. Their lowest moments came whenever Hilda caught him dipping into her hard-earned money; in December 1978 , he put all the money in the house into a (previously empty) fruit machine, and then unthinkingly let Eddie Yeats take it the machine away with their TV plug attached. Just as the realisation set in, the house was plunged into darkness as the electricity meter ran out - all in all, a typical day at the Ogdens'.\nHowever, Stan genuinely wanted to make Hilda happy, and his gestures which did work were all the more touching for their rarity. He scored a definite hit with the serving hatch in 1971 , and in October 1969 he secretly joined Fatties Anonymous with Betty Turpin , telling the people at the meeting that he was doing it for his wife. In spite of her problems with Stan, Hilda couldn't imagine life without him and was lost whenever he wasn't around; when he vanished one night in March 1976 , she scoured the streets for him before she found out he and Albert Tatlock had accidentally been locked in the Rovers cellar. After spending the night getting merry and singing war songs down in the cellar, they were found by Hilda and Annie Walker , and Hilda was furious when Stan grinned and asked if she'd missed him.\nStan had his faults but Hilda knew his limits. In August 1972 , he was caught in the backing where a peeping tom had been seen spying on the women of the Street. A lynch mob led by Billy Walker and Ray Langton carted him over to No.13, their minds made up that he was the peeping tom, but Hilda believed in her husband's innocence, even though he was supposed to be at The Flying Horse . The mere accusation was enough to defeat Stan, but Hilda wanted to fight back and told the residents what she thought of them in the Rovers, referencing Billy's dirty magazines, and spat on the floor. The residents had to swallow their pride and apologise when the true culprit was caught.\nHilda and Stan's affection for each other was strengthened by the fact that they were both life's victims. Despite being the neighbourhood joke, for most of their time at No.13 theirs was the most successful marriage in the Street. In public, Hilda would defend Stan from the very accusations she threw at him at home. Her image of Stan was so idealised that she was paranoid about other women plotting to get their hands on him, from Freda Woods at the British Legion to Mary Bonnetti , Stan's ice-cream vendor partner. The latter got Hilda so worried that she reported Stan to the Town Hall for trading without a licence, ending the partnership. A continuing thorn in Hilda's side was Clara Regan of 19 Inkerman Street , or rather the rumours of her affair with Stan which were all over Weatherfield. Hilda didn't believe them - finding out in January 1973 that Clara was co-habiting with Tommy McAllistair was enough to satisfy her - but she hated everyone sending them up about it and refused to dignify Clara with a name, referring to her only as \"19 Inkerman Street\".\n1977 : \"What's that lipstick taste of?\" \"Woman Stanley, woman!\"\nHilda's happiest moment came when the Ogdens won third prize in a \"Loving Cup Shandies\" competition - a second honeymoon night in a five-star hotel with her winning slogan \"Be a mistress as well as a wife and your husband'll still be a boyfriend\". Hilda was determined to enjoy herself in luxury for once, forcing Stan to give her the romantic evening she craved, when he just wanted to watch TV and raid the drinks cabinet.\nAfter Stan's death, all past rows were forgotten and Hilda would always remember Stan as the perfect husband.\nIrma Ogden\n1970 : Mother and daughter exchange words over a morning cuppa\nWhat Irma got from her parents could be written on the back of a playing card. Irma was fun-loving, didn't take life too seriously, and even a little reckless. Where her parents were concerned, Irma couldn't wait to get away, even though she loved them. She frequently put Stan and Hilda down, often without them realising it.\nHilda liked having Irma close by as the Ogdens had so few friends in the Street. She approved of her wedding to David Barlow , and also of their decision to buy the Corner Shop - Irma allowed the Ogdens a generous amount on tick. Irma helped her parents out whenever she could, and in May 1966 , when she got a job at the PVC Factory , she sent in Hilda to fill her shoes at the shop, much to David's horror. That August , the couples went on a caravan holiday, where Hilda and Irma bonded and threw water over their husbands when they stayed out all night.\nWhen Irma and David decided to move to Australia , Hilda was so distraught that she sent drayman Vince Boyle to share his terrible experiences of the country with Irma, a move which nearly caused them to part on a sour note. Out of loyalty to Irma, Hilda took in Irma and David's foster daughter Jill Morris when she turned up at the shop looking for them as her mum was in hospital.\nIn September 1970 , with Irma on holiday in Torquay and Maggie Clegg in Birmingham , Hilda looked after the shop. As Irma hadn't left her precise instructions for replenishing the stock, Hilda decided to try something different and ordered large quantities of specialised stock from Walter Gilfeather , surprising even him. The scheme ended in disaster, with Hilda ending up having a bargain sale to shift the new stock, and she ended up £7, 2/9 down. When she got back, Irma got Hilda to clean the shop to make it up to her.\nWhen Irma suddenly fled to Llandudno that December , Hilda looked after her interests at the shop, although Betty Turpin opined that she had really left to get away from Stan and Hilda. Irma then gradually faded out of the Ogdens' lives, and eventually moved to Canada , where she was living when Stan passed away in 1984 . Hilda excused her daughter's non-appearance at the funeral, telling Trevor that she was starting a new life abroad.\nElsie Tanner\n1968 : Handbags at dawn\n\"Come back here Elsie Tanner, I want to sort you out!\"\nElsie Tanner of No.11 was Hilda and Stan's next-door neighbour. Hilda looked down on Elsie for having so many men in her life, in some ways taking up the mantle from Ena Sharples , but unlike her previous nemesis who could get Elsie really riled up with her vicious tongue, Hilda wasn't taken seriously and was treated mainly as an irritant.\nIn June 1968 , Hilda and Elsie had a row in the Street where Hilda accused Elsie of having an affair with Stan, as they'd been AWOL for hours after Stan gave Elsie a driving lesson (the explanation being that they'd run out of petrol on the moors). Elsie laughed at Hilda's allegations, saying she'd never go for Stan as she had eyes.\nOn two occasions, Hilda nearly caused Elsie to lose her job by informing her employers about Elsie being in court for stealing from Miami Modes , and in 1973 Elsie's disappearance led to all kinds of rumours, most of them started by Hilda, leading to a confrontation in the Rovers in which Alan Howard punched Stan, who had stood up to defend his wife. If not their biggest, then certainly their pettiest battle occurred in 1978 , when Suzie Birchall accidentally put her foot through No.13's bedroom ceiling while moving a nest of pigeons in the loft. Elsie refused to pay the repairs as the pigeons had got in through a missing slate in Hilda's roof, and so Hilda poked holes in Elsie's ceiling with her broom to get even. The households then went to war, doing everything from blaring music through the wall and dirtying their neighbours' washing. It was resolved in court, where Hilda and Elsie were ordered to pay for their own repairs - a resolution which satisfied Elsie, but not Hilda.\nIn July 1980 , Hilda called round to No.11 to borrow a cup of sugar and found the sofa ablaze and Elsie unconscious. With Stan's help, she dragged Elsie away to safety. Proclaimed a heroine, Hilda made the most of it by getting Elsie to buy her drinks and over-dramatising her heroics. Eventually Elsie got so sick of Hilda going on about it that she told Hilda to walk past the next time her house was on fire!\nIn possibly her only act of kindness towards her neighbour, Hilda donated some clothes to Elsie when hers were cut up by Muriel Fielding in May 1981 .\nAnnie Walker\nAnnie Walker was Hilda's pretentious employer at the Rovers. Annie was generally kind to Hilda, although she often had to remind her that she was there to clean and not to chit-chat. Hilda first discovered Annie's iron fist a month after arriving in the Street; when Annie caught Hilda and Irma shifting onions Trevor had secretly stored in the Rovers' cellar, Annie sacked them both on the spot, although Hilda managed to get her job back.\n1977 : Hilda confronts Annie when she is underpays Stan, who is subbing for Hilda\nHilda admired Annie but envied her standing in the community and greatly wanted to out-do her. In 1974 , before Hilda left Weatherfield to board cruise ship the Monte Umber for a six-week cleaning job, Annie coached Hilda on etiquette, advising her to step aside to let a first class passenger past. When she got back, Hilda showed off by ordering a \"Planeter's Punch\" cocktail to try and catch Annie out. Annie easily made the drink but charged 98p for that and a pint for Stan, reminding Hilda that the ship was duty free and the Rovers wasn't. In 1976 , when Hilda put up her beloved mural, part of its appeal was that Annie didn't have one, but when Hilda invited her over to the house to show it off, Annie barely gave it a second glance, although she couldn't help noticing that Hilda had copied her bedroom wallpaper. \"Isn't it amazing how different things seem in a different room?\" commented Annie sardonically.\nAnnie occasionally suffered the consequences of Hilda's gossip, such as in 1975 when Hilda informed Newton & Ridley about a break-in at the Rovers which Annie wanted to keep quiet as she didn't want to lose the brewery's confidence. In direct confrontations, however, Annie's way with words easily outmatched Hilda's all-guns-blazing approach.\nEddie Yeats\n1977 : Eddie spends Christmas with the Ogdens\nEdward Yeats entered the Ogdens' lives in December 1974 . On parole from Walton , he bought their Christmas tree from Stan for £2. In March 1975 , when his fellow 5 Coronation Street houseguest Ena Sharples proved to be less of a soft touch than his landlady Minnie Caldwell , he partnered up with Hilda on Stan's window round. He and Hilda were a good team, bringing in more money than Stan had.\nReleased from Walton for the last time in July 1976 , Eddie soon fell in with the Ogdens. Hilda didn't trust him because of his shady past and dodgy mates, and his laziness and flannel did nothing to endear him to her. She treated him like a bad penny whenever he darkened No.13's doors, greeting him with a resigned \"oh, it's you\". Over time, Eddie demonstrated that he had a good heart and an affinity for the Ogdens, who were all the 'family' he had, and Hilda became fond of him.\nBoth moronic and bone-idle, Eddie and Stan were kindred spirits. They would often get up to things behind Hilda's back, knowing she would not approve. In October 1978 , Eddie's friend Tiny Hargreaves paid Stan for the use of his cart to shift stolen lead, but Hilda saw Tiny using the cart and took it when he wasn't looking, thinking he'd stolen it. Hilda was then stopped by the police and the cart impounded because of the stolen lead. Fearing repercussions, Eddie refused to shop Tiny, but Hilda refused to have Stan arrested and made him tell the police the truth. The following April , with Hilda away, Eddie took possession of six hens and talked Stan into letting him store them in No.13's back yard after Albert Tatlock told him he couldn't have them on his allotment. After returning home to find a chicken on her table, Hilda told Eddie to get rid of the hens, but was talked round when Eddie said they faced the slaughter. To keep Hilda on side, Eddie bought eggs from the Corner Shop and planted them in the chicken coop. Getting wind of the scheme, Suzie mischievously put some hard-boiled eggs in the coop, which Hilda gave to Ena, resulting in much embarrassment in the Rovers when Ena cut an egg open in front of Hilda. Hilda ordered Eddie to kill the hens, planning to eat one for Stan's birthday, but in the end Albert had to perform the deed as they'd all grown so attached to them, and, unable to bring himself to carve them, Eddie sold them to a butcher for £3.\nFrom 1980 to 1983 Eddie was the Ogdens' lodger, taken in due to his full-time job on the bins. In March 1981 , Eddie caused the Ogdens to lose all their washing when he accidentally took a black bag containing their laundry to the tip instead of a bag of rubbish. Determined to recover it, Hilda made Stan and Eddie help her scour the tip for the bag, but surrounded by so many identical black bags, they didn't find their washing. A guilty Eddie organised a whip-round for the Ogdens and managed to earn their forgiveness, the whole debacle treated like just another Ogden misadventure.\nHilda took a somewhat motherly role in Eddie's love life. In 1980 , she approved of advised Lorna Ferguson to go steady with Eddie. Two years later, she made the effort to get to know Marion Willis , but nearly had a falling out with Eddie when he copied her key to Mike Baldwin 's flat to court Marion there, pretending he was a businessman. Eddie left the Ogdens' lives in December 1983 when he and Marion, now a married couple, moved to Bury , but the following year Eddie phoned the Rovers to pass onto Hilda the news that Marion had had a baby girl, Dawn , and in 1987 he paid a visit to Weatherfield to see Hilda when she was hospitalised after she and Joan Lowther were attacked by burglars.\nKevin and Sally Webster\nIn May 1985 , Kevin Webster decided he'd had enough of his landlady Emily Bishop 's stuffiness and fellow lodger Curly Watts 's 5am wake-up calls, and with Hilda's approval moved into No.13. Kevin found Hilda a friendly, easygoing landlady, and would refer to her affectionately as \"Mrs. O\". He gave Hilda no trouble in his two years at No.13, showing himself to be a respectable young man.\n1986 : Hilda hopes Kevin and Sally won't last long\nHilda's relationship with Sally Seddon wasn't so smooth-sailing. Introduced to Kevin's new girlfriend early in 1986 , Hilda was cold to her due to her being from the roughneck Seddon family, and decided she wasn't good enough for Kevin. In March , she warned Kevin she'd seen Sally with another man, but he didn't believe her and stayed with Sally. Two months later, after accepting that Sally wasn't like her parents, Hilda agreed to let Sally live at No.13 to get away from Eddie Seddon , Convinced that Kevin and Sally would try to sleep together against her permission, Hilda laid a trap for Sally on the stairs, only to forget about it and fall herself. While Hilda was out of work with a sprained ankle, Sally stood in for her at the Lowthers' house and the Baldwins ' flat , where she did such a bad job that Susan Baldwin nearly sacked her. Hilda's derogatory comments about her work upset Sally so much that she returned to live with her parents.\nKevin and Sally were married by the end of the year. On their wedding day, Hilda gave Sally marriage advice, telling her not to blame Kevin in times of trouble. The following year, Hilda helped them get the Corner Shop flat by pretending to Alf Roberts that Sally would be leaving her job at the shop immediately and the Websters moving to Partington . As he was in the middle of a council election campaign, Alf needed Sally behind the counter and offered the Websters the flat without hesitation. When she left Weatherifeld a few months later, Hilda sold No.13 to the Websters for a generously low price as a mark of affection for the young newlyweds.\nHobbies, interests and skills\n1979 : Hilda's one-fingered performance of Beautiful Dreamer garners a less than stellar reception...\nHilda frequently showed an interest in art and culture to have something to show off about. She would always exaggerate how well she knew the subject, but then give the game away with her malapropisms or basic misunderstandings, with comic results.\nHer forays into art and culture were numerous and short-lived. She once wrote a play about a gas leak which led to nothing, and in February 1976 , she joined an art class at the Community Centre . In January 1979 , while painting the skirting boards at No.13, she found by accident that she could copy abstract art. When a painting of hers fetched £20 from Annie Walker (who had no idea the identity of the artist), Hilda made the most of it by getting Annie to compliment it at every opportunity, however Annie found out and got revenge by telling Hilda she sold it to an art dealer at a huge profit. That August , she taught herself to play the piano and actually showed promise, beaming with pride when Ena - a seasoned harmonium player - applauded her after a performance. Others, however, were not complimentary; walking in on Hilda practicing Beautiful Dreamer on the Rovers piano, Annie accused her of turning it into an ugly nightmare.\nIn June 1973 , Hilda joined a ballroom dancing class at the centre, agreeing to be Ted Loftus 's partner (with Stan's permission). She also partook in the 1969 football grudge match between the Rovers and The Flying Horse , where she scored an equaliser (much to her worn out team-mates's fury as they then had to play on to extra time), and at the 1984 Pub Olympics between the two pubs she won the egg-and-spoon race when she came in second behind Vera Duckworth who was disqualified due to cheating.\nHilda also took to the stage during the Street's Christmas panto productions, filling out the cast in bit parts including Wishee Washee in Aladdin in 1968 and one of the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella in 1975. In 1977, tricked by Bet Lynch into thinking it was fancy dress, Hilda turned up at the factory Christmas party dressed as Charlie Chaplin. She ended up having a good time, blacking up and singing an Al Jolson song to the OAPs next door at the centre when the booked act never turned up.\nHilda loved to sing, especially her old 1940s favourites. With a trilling singing voice compared to Mick Jagger stuck up the plumbing, and a piano going down a flight of stairs, Hilda could most often be heard as she went about her cleaning, hanging out the washing, or admiring her mural.\nClairvoyancy\n1969 : Hilda turns psychic\nHilda had \"the gift\" since before she moved to Coronation Street. In December 1964 , she read the cards of several residents, including Valerie Barlow , where she correctly predicted that Val would have twins.\nIn early 1969 , Hilda took it up again and considered reading tea leaves professionally. While he didn't believe in her gift, Stan was keen on the idea as, charging half a guinea a time, they'd be quids in if Hilda could pull it off. To encourage her, he went around trying to make her predictions come true without her knowledge, but confessed to Hilda out of fear that a reporter would find out and accuse her of fraud. To avert suspicion, Hilda publicly announced her gift had gone.\nHilda continued to believe that she had the sight, and often gave impromptu readings. In August 1977 , after two predictions came true, her clairvoyancy attracted some attention. Along with Bet, Suzie, Elsie and Gail Potter , she held a seance in No.13, where she seemed to go into a trance and be possessed, although she later claimed to have no memory of the event.\nTravel\nHilda's long-held desire to get away from everything was apparent to every visitor to No.13's back room. In 1978 , her beloved mural of the Canadian Rockies was ruined when Stan left the taps running in the bathroom and flooded the house. Hilda bought a replacement herself, this time depicting a seascape.\nHilda and Stan's getaways were few and far between, and when they did plan a holiday, catastrophe would always strike. In September 1969 , when Stan got a week off work, Hilda insisted on going to Llandudno, but Stan \"accidentally\" tripped over a roller-skate left on the street and they spent the day sat outside the Rovers under Annie's umbrellas instead.\nHilda particularly longed to visit France . In January 1972 , the Ogdens got as far as booking a day trip to Paris and getting to the airport, but Stan panicked in the terminal and went to get fresh air, causing them to miss the plane. To keep up appearances, they spent the day in the airport bar and staggered into the Rovers later, pretending they'd been on the trip. Hilda finally got to go to France in 1980 , when she won an exchange visit to Charleville , Weatherfield's twin town, where she went to a rave-up with Vera and Ivy Tilsley .\n1974 : Hilda in Majorca\nIn August 1974 , Stan bought a tandem from Billy Walker for £8.50. Hilda excitedly planned a trip to Morecambe , but when the time came, the Ogdens found the tandem too difficult to ride and left the bike with railway porter Syd Greaves , who gave it to Ray Langton. When they came back (of course, pretending to everyone that they'd used the tandem), Ray tried to set them up by painting the tandem white and claiming it was his, but, on Hilda's instructions, Stan painted it black again, making Ray look like an idiot when he said it was his; for once, the Ogdens came out on top. Hilda would occasionally take the tandem out again but, met with Stan's disinterest, eventually sold it to Gail and Suzie for £7 - only to find out from Len Fairclough that it was worth £100. Eddie managed to buy the bike back for £15 without letting on the girls its true worth, and went off to sell the bike with Stan, but when they abandoned it to go into a pub, the wall it was resting against was demolished, burying it - a tale Hilda point blank refused to believe.\nTelevision\nIn the 1970s , as the nation switched to colour television, Hilda was determined that No.13 would be the first house in Coronation Street to upgrade. Hilda saved her pennies and for nine glorious days in 1971 (after which it was repossessed), the Ogdens' back room was graced with a colour set. Hilda battled on, trying to get one on approval, but the Ogdens were turned down as they were on a credit blacklist.\nOver the next few years, one-by-one the neighbours bought colour sets. In January 1978 , Hilda camped outside Perkins overnight to be first in the morning queue, guaranteeing her a colour TV for £5 in the sale. After spending the night in the company of a meths-drinking tramp called Ozzie , Hilda lost her place in the queue as she was in the middle of being interviewed by a local radio reporter, Ted Thomas , when the shop opened its doors, and someone else bought the TV.\nThree years later, Eddie managed to borrow a colour TV for the day so that Hilda could watch the Royal Wedding . Hilda took out her curlers for the occasion.\n1976 : After years of having a telly and no licence, the Ogdens have a licence and no telly...\nOn one occasion, the Ogdens didn't have a TV at all. In February 1976 , when a TV detector van roamed the area, Hilda bought a TV licence to be on the safe side. As she walked into the house to tell Stan, she surprised him when he was moving the TV to hide it away, causing him to drop and break it. After a tip from Betty Turpin , Stan set fire to the TV and told the rental company it had burst into flames, but rental man Sid Wilson didn't believe him and demanded £75 for the set. Meanwhile, Hilda was getting caught up in entering competitions and won a trolley dash at a delicatessen. Together with Deirdre Langton , she grabbed £107.32 worth of goods, but, missing her programmes, traded it in for the cash amount and paid the TV bill.\nBackground information\n1964 cast portrait of Jean Alexander as Hilda\nIn the spring of 1964 , producer Tim Aspinall initiated Coronation Street 's first major cast shake-up, axing six characters in total. To fill the void, a new family was planned around the character of Irma Ogden , a recent addition to the programme played by Sandra Gough . The family would be more vulgar than viewers were used to seeing, headed up by layabout lorry driver Stan and his nagging wife Hilda, and supported by their four children - Irma, Trevor , Tony and Sylvia .\nJean Alexander was born in Liverpool in 1926 . She began her career as a library assistant before transferring her talents to repertory theatre, firstly as a wardrobe mistress and then as a stage mistress, in various places in the North West including Oldham , York , and the Adelphi Guild Theatre in Macclesfield . She then realised her ambition of becoming an actress, spending seven years with Southport rep. She had an early TV role as Mrs. Webb , landlady of baby kidnapper Joan Akers , in two episodes of Coronation Street in 1962 , which paved the way for her subsequent casting as Hilda two years later. Betty Driver also auditioned for the part, but was rejected as casting directors wanted a more slender actress for Hilda.\nStan made his debut in Episode 370 but viewers had to wait to be introduced to his wife as transmission of the following episode was delayed by a week by strike action by the ACTT (Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians). An additional result of the strike was that the following week's episodes, which were at the rehearsal stage when the strike occurred, went unrecorded, with production picking up with Episode 374 the week after. The unmade episodes would have seen the Ogdens move into No.13 and Tony and Sylvia make their debut appearances. During this period, plans for the Ogdens were revised, cutting the number of children from four to two.\nThe rise of Stan and Hilda\nStan and Hilda rose in popularity throughout the 1960s\nAmid the controversy over Aspinall's cast cull, the Ogdens stood out as a bright spot to writer H.V. Kershaw , who returned to his role as producer when Aspinall stepped down in September . Praising the chemistry between the actors, he remarked in his 1981 book The Street Where I Live (1981): \"After a few weeks of Bernard Youens and Jean Alexander as the ill-starred Stan and Hilda, it is patently obvious that they are here to stay for ever.\"\nInitially, Hilda was characterised as a tough working class woman who stood at her uncouth husband's side, blind to his flaws. This was subtly changed as writers realised the comic potential of Hilda being more of a fishwife - all the while defending him vehemently when anyone else dared take a potshot, as remarked upon by Kershaw: \"The Ogdens, Hilda and Stan, arguably one of the funniest cross-talk teams on television, are to my mind at their best when they are poignant. Hilda, thin and defiant, defending the fat, lazy Stan against an unkind world,\" and Jean Alexander: \"They would bicker between themselves but one one else dared raise a finger or say a word against either of them or they'd both be up in arms.\" (Fifty Years of Coronation Street, Headline Publishing Group, 2010) On her role: \"As a character she's interesting to play, and I like her because she's the opposite of me. She lets fly at people in a way I'd like to myself and never do. When I'm being Hilda, I can get it all out of my system.\" (The Coronation Street Story)\nTheir relationship was tinkered with again when Bill Podmore took over as producer in 1976 , with Stan becoming more hen-pecked and Geoffrey Hughes entering the fray as Eddie Yeats , the Ogdens' prodigal son (with Irma and Trevor long having left the programme). Podmore: \"Stan and Hilda were one of the great comedy couples. In my book they rivalled Morecambe and Wise.\" (Coronation Street: The Inside Story, 1990)\nAt the peak of Hilda's popularity, character and actress gained a number of accolades, including being named as the fourth most recognisable woman in the UK after the Queen , Queen Mother and Diana in a 1982 poll and, more oddly, prompting Michael Parkinson , Russell Harty and Sir John Betjeman to form the British League for Hilda Ogden, with Laurence Olivier as it's president. Olivier was such a fan of the character that he requested a part in the programme. A part was written for him - a meths-drinking tramp called Ozzie who camped outside a shop next to Hilda while she queued overnight for a discounted colour TV - however a scheduling conflict resulted in Olivier being unable to take the role. Podmore: \"Hilda Ogden was a legend. Universities wanted to make her their rector; a Welsh rugby team hailed her as their mascot; even the Falklands Fleet urgently called for a picture of their pin-up complete with curlers, to inspire the troops for battle.\"\nGlad rags and that voice\nJean Alexander as Hilda in the 1970s\nHilda's famous look - with her curlers, headscarf and pinny - was developed over time by Jean Alexander and the wardrobe department. Alexander felt that the curlers said something about the character: \"I remembered seeing the women working on munitions during the war. All the girls in the factories had to have their heads covered because of the machinery. They used to wear these scarves, like pudding clothes, tied up and the curlers would be in.. I thought Hilda would have worked on munitions and would have had her hair tied up... She was always ready to go out - only she never went out. The curlers were always in, just in case she happened to be going out in the evening.\" (The Coronation Street Story, Boxtree Limited, 1995) About the pinny: \"It was donkeys' years old, but it seemed to fascinate viewers who used to write in in droves to see where they could buy one similar.\" (Life in the Street, Boxtree Limited, 1991)\nOne bonus of Hilda sporting such a different look from Alexander's day clothes was that she wasn't recognised all that often - a fact appreciated by an actress who guarded her privacy. Podmore: \"She could transform herself within seconds. A touch of lipstick, a headscarf, an old mackintosh and a curler or two, and there stood Hilda Ogden in all her pinched-mouth glory. At the end of the day the cloak of Hilda was discarded as quickly as it was created and left behind in the studio. Jean Alexander could stand on Salford station and catch her train home safe in the knowledge that none of her fellow passengers would give the elegant lady a second glance.\"\nAnother trait of Hilda's worked out early on was her famously shrill singing voice. Viewers were introduced to Hilda's \"talent\" soon after she arrived in the street, as Jean Alexander recalls: \"I'd been in it a couple of months and the script said: 'Hilda is out of shot in the backyard pegging out washing and singing.' So I just started singing the sort of songs that Hilda would know, that were from my own era actually, and the crew fell about laughing. They all thought it was hysterical, so after that whenever they wrote in \"Hilda sings\". they'd never state the song and they'd just leave that to me.\" (Fifty Years)\nThe \"muriel\"\nThe Oggies with Eddie and the \"muriel\"\nWhen Bill Podmore became Coronation Street's producer in 1976, one of his goals was to increase the amount of comedy in the scripts. One of the first stories devised for the Ogdens was the re-decoration of No.13's parlour and the establishment of Hilda's beloved mural, or \"muriel\" as she called it (an example of her malapropisms which were frequently worked into scripts), and its flying ducks - one of which could never stay up.\nAccording to Alexander, the scenes inside No.13 were recorded at the end of of Episode 1616 's studio day, leaving no margin for error: \"We had about six scenes, with the room in various stages of stripping and repapering, we had fifty minutes of studio time left to do these six scenes. It was so fast! We'd do one scene and then the prop men would come on and strip a bit more wallpaper off. You couldn't enjoy it because nobody dared dry.\" (The Coronation Street Story) On the mural itself: \"(Hilda's) was a life of disappointment, so it was my idea that the middle flying duck on her famous 'muriel' should always be taking a nose-dive. Each time Hilda went past she would try to push it up straight, but it always fell down again. Which summed up her life really. They did live at Number 13 after all.\" ( 50 Years of Coronation Street: The (very) Unofficial Story , JR Books, 2010)\nStan's death\nIn 1975 , Bernard Youens suffered a minor stroke, the first in a series of health problems which plagued the actor for the rest of his life. By the early 1980s , his speech and mobility were affected, and as a result Hilda and Eddie took on most of the dialogue in their scenes to ease the burden on the actor, who wished to continue on in the programme. He died aged sixty-nine on 27th August 1984 , much to the sadness of the cast and crew, particularly his screen wife of twenty years. Alexander: \"I miss him more than I can say. We never had to discuss a scene or go over a piece of dialogue together. He always turned up word-perfect, just as I did, and we knew exactly how we were going to play it. Working without \"Bunny\" was like acting without my arm.\" (Life in the Street)\nStan passed away peacefully in hospital in November 1984 after a lengthy absence from screens. In a famous scene, after holding back the tears for the duration of the episode, Hilda broke down alone in No.13 while unwrapping Stan's effects from the hospital. Podmore: \"Coronation Street's scriptwriting team, with Jean's total approval, had decided that Hilda would never allow herself to shed a tear in public no matter how great her sadness. We all thought long and hard about how she might deal with her husband's death. The breakdown had to come some time, and we chose the moment when Hilda unwrapped the sad little parcel she brought home from the hospital, which contained Stan's few personal effects. Jean's playing of that scene was devastating; as she closed Stan's spectacle case the nation wept with her.\"\nAlexander's performance during the scene won her the Royal Television Society's Best Performance Award the following year. Alexander: \"It was the first award I had ever received, and the proudest moment of my life.\" (Life in the Street)\nDeparture\nIn the mid- 1980s ; Bill Podmore took a step back into a role as executive producer , with John G. Temple taking over as producer. For the next three years, Alexander remained with the programme, exploring Hilda's life as a widow. According to Podmore, this wasn't the original plan: \"My long-term plan was for Eddie Yeats to take over as comic-relief lodger. It just might have worked, and Jean Alexander's wonderful character might still have been bottoming out the Rovers and mopping up every morsel of Coronation Street 's gossip.\" However, Hughes quit the programme in 1983 , and Hilda was instead supported by newcomers Kevin and Sally Webster .\n1987 : Hilda's final appearance draws a record audience\nIn 1987 , Alexander decided that it was time to move on, and broke the news to the producer: \"It was nice and it was a secure job and all that, but suddenly I thought, I don't want to be here for the rest of my life. I'd like to do some of the things I was doing before I ever came into this show. I would like to play other parts before I fall off my perch... I went in to see Bill Podmore and said, 'I've decided I want to leave at the end of my contract - Christmas .' 'Oh,' he said, 'I've been dreading the day when you'd come in and say that. (The Coronation Street Story) Podmore: \"I really did think Hilda's retirement would be one of the great watersheds, and I was dreading the inevitable moment.\"\nHilda's final appearance , broadcast on Christmas Day 1987 , saw Hilda sing \" Wish Me Luck As You Wave Me Goodbye \", in her trademark trilling voice, before leaving Weatherfield to keep house for her employer, Doctor Lowther - a happy ending for a character who had spent her life going from pillar to post. The episode was watched by 17.97 million viewers on Christmas Day, with 8.65 million viewers catching up via a one-off omnibus repeat, resulting in a total audience of 26.62 million viewers - Coronation Street's second-highest ever audience figure.\nReprising the role\nHilda returns in the 1990 ITV Telethon\nJean Alexander has declined numerous invitations to reprise her character, with four exceptions. The first was the 1990 ITV Telethon , which featured a mini-episode showing a more prosperous Hilda visit the Street on her way to Stan's grave. Alexander was reluctant to return to the part, but on this occasion the circumstances were right: \"When Granada asked me to return, I had to stop and think. I didn't really want to be Hilda again. I was worried I'd start up the old associations. But, as it was a one-off for such worthwhile charities, I couldn't really say no.\" On what viewers could expect: \"Hilda has changed. Having sold her house, she's got a few pennies tucked away, along with her wages from the doctor, plus her own flat in his house. Now that she's better off, she's less envious. But, knowing Hilda, she might show off a bit.\"\nJean Alexander reprised her role again in 1996 to record the audio book 'Street Talk - Hilda Ogden: In Her Own Words', and appear in a one off advert for Granada Plus.\nAlexander last played Hilda in a 1998 video special The Women of Coronation Street . The special showed Betty Williams visit Hilda in Derbyshire and reminisce (and gossip) about the women of Coronation Street past and present, segueing into archive clips.\nDespite the passage of time, Hilda remained immensely popular. In 2005 , she was voted the UK's favourite soap character of all time in a TV Times poll. However, she has never returned to the show proper, despite numerous invitations. Writer John Stevenson : \"They've asked her to come back many times but she won't, and it's too late now.\" (50 Years) On her reasons for staying away, Alexander: \"It'd be a complete mistake to go back. And Hilda would be a different person now because she has achieved the status she'd wanted all her life - to be the doctor's housekeeper and have her own apartment in his house. She'd have smartened herself up no end.\" (Fifty Years) On her character's enduring appeal: \"Hilda would have loved that and I am honoured people still remember her so fondly. I suppose the viewers recognised the type, and on location on the backstreets of Manchester , I've happened upon a few Hildas myself who could've come straight off the Coronation Street set.\" (Fifty Years)\nSee also\n\"Hey Stan look, we've got two taps\" (First line)\n---\n\"Drop dead Stan.

Alec\" Gilroy was a ... house in Handforth, Cheshire, now ... Alec Gilroy - Coronation Street Wiki - Wikia Alec Gilroy | Coronation Street Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nRoy Barraclough\nAlexander \"Alec\" Gilroy was a theatrical agent who had two stints as landlord of the Rovers Return .\nAlec's first wife was Joyce , with whom he had a daughter, Sandra , in 1958 . In 1971 , he became estranged from Joyce and Sandra, and concentrated on his career, managing clubs and artistes, including singer Rita Littlewood . In 1986 , he was managing the Graffiti Club in Rosamund Street when he had a dalliance with Bet Lynch , then-landlady of the Rovers. He claimed not to be interested in the Rovers but when Bet couldn't afford the tenancy on her own, Alec proposed marriage to her so that they could run the pub together, and Bet accepted.\nAlec was happy with Bet but they were rather an odd couple; Bet was bold and brassy, while Alec was morose and miserly. Theirs was a marriage of convenience but while they came to love each other, they had different outlooks and goals in life and in 1992 , when he was offered the job of MC on a cruise ship, Bet refused to relocate to Southampton with him, and Alec told Bet their marriage was over.\nAlec returned to Weatherfield in 1996 and spent a year running the local branch of Sunliners Travel Agency . After being made redundant, he bought into the Rovers, gradually edging partners Jack and Vera Duckworth out of the business until he had total control. In 1998 , a tired and weary Alec sold the Rovers to Natalie Barnes to go into partnership with granddaughter Vicky McDonald at a wine bar in Brighton .\nContents\nEdit\n1960s : Alec when he had it all - a family and a fledgling career. He lost both in 1971\nAlexander Gilroy was the younger of two children born to Reg and Mabel Gilroy at 4 Back Gas Street , on the rough side of Weatherfield . Growing up, Alexander (or \"Alec\" as he preferred) and his sister Edna became accustomed to the house's peculiar smell which was caused by fumes from the local gasworks, where Reg worked as a stoker, and the lingering odour from Tasker's Glue Factory clinging to Mabel's clothes.\nAt fourteen, Alec left school to go into grafting, but he was never destined to follow in his father's footsteps. Edna could belt out a tune, and not one to be outperformed by his own sister, Alec built up an act using trained ferrets. Performing as a duo with Edna at any venue that would have them, Alec's first foray into showbusiness ended when Edna got married, and after a particularly raucous evening at the Weatherfield Rugby Club , Alec's ferrets were set free.\nRemaining in the showbusiness game, Alec moved backstage with a job at the Weatherfield Majestic . It was here that he honed his craft as a talent scout, bolstering the Majestic's roster of speciality acts with a keen eye for talent, and negotiating skills to match. Alec became known locally for his ability to pluck a performer from obscurity and have them on stage that same day. One of his acts was Harry \"Bing\" Crosby , who played a musical saw. Harry was assisted backstage by his daughter Joyce , who on meeting Alec was swept away by his tales of showbusiness and the big time. Thinking he'd found his Mrs. Gilroy, Alec popped the question, and in 1955 the couple were married. Alec's rise to the top continued when he was promoted to front of house and in 1958 Alec and Joyce's daughter Sandra was born.\nUnfortunately, in wider circles, Alec's success at the Majestic amounted to little more than a blip. Alec had joined the industry at a time when all good talent was deserting variety in favour of television and cabaret, and although his farmyard impressionists and balloon benders were an improvement on the slackwire acts and strong women who tore up telephone books, Alec was powerless against the changing tide, and in 1971 the Majestic was turned into a bingo hall. An unemployed Alec also faced the end of a marriage, as Joyce, seeking a more glamorous life, ran off with footballer Stan Shaw , taking thirteen-year-old Sandra with her. Alec maintained minimal contact with Joyce, and didn't see Sandra again for many years, putting his heartbreak behind him by concentrating on his career.\n1972-1985: Alec Gilroy presents\n1972 : Alec books Rita Littlewood as he takes over the Victoria Street Working Men's Club\nIn 1972 , Alec tried his hand at club management, taking over the Working Men's Club in Victoria Street when it was opened in June of that year. One of the acts Alec booked for opening night was singer Rita Littlewood , who at that point was back on the club circuit after leaving her common-law husband Harry Bates . The night's entertainment went down well, with Alec telling Len Fairclough over a drink that he was keen to hire Rita again. Having taken a shine to Rita, Len tipped her off her about Alec wanting her back, allowing her to get more money out of him.\nAfter three years toiling in working men's clubs, Alec was still as penniless as the day he started in Victoria Street, when at last his chance came. At eighty years old, talent agent legend Joe Bluntstone was retiring, which meant his agency of 100+ acts would soon be on the market. Alec offered the man 50% of the agency's takings for the rest of his life, in exchange for Alec getting the rest with no money down. A week after Joe accepted the deal, he dropped dead. While basking in his good fortune, Alec encountered Rita Littlewood in the Rovers Return , and persuaded her to sign with the Bluntstone Gilroy Organisation (later renamed Alec Gilroy Presents ), with Ernest Bishop as her pianist. Rita and Ernie played together at a number of venues in the latter half of 1975, after which her singing career once again died a death.\nAfter Joe's death, Alec found his acts gradually deserting him, having only stayed on out of loyalty to Joe. Within a few short years he had only novelty acts left on his books, and he was forced to take on additional work managing local night spots.\nIn later years, Alec would describe 1981 as \"a very bad time\" for him.\nBy the mid- 1980s , Alec was managing the Graffiti Club in Rosamund Street . The Graffiti Club was a Newton & Ridley venue, and Alec maintained a sideline of providing acts from his dwindling agency for entertainment at Newton & Ridley's establishments.\n1986-1987: Lynched\nAlec in 1986\nOriginally a venture of Mike Baldwin and Alec Yardley aimed at the young and trendy crowd, the Graffiti Club's best days were behind it by the time of Alec's arrival; the disco had closed down, and the bar area made the Mary Celeste look overcrowded. The club saw a revival of fortunes when the Rovers Return was closed following a devastating fire, with Alec poaching Jack Duckworth and Gloria Todd as bar staff. However, trade fell back to normal levels when the brewery opened a renovated Rovers, and Alec's new recruits abandoned him. Not that Alec minded; his talent agency was once again thriving, and raising its profile was far more worthy of a man of Alec's skill than tending bar.\nAcross the Street from the Graffifi, the Rovers Return was a backstreet boozer, managed by Bet Lynch , with whom Alec had established a friendly rivalry. In November 1986 , under pressure from the brewery to increase trade, Bet turned to Alec for artistes, but refused to pay his prices and held an open mike night instead. The night was a disaster, but Alec gained Bet's respect and friendship by giving her a special discount for a second night's entertainment, putting her back in favour with the brewery.\nAlec continued to visit the Rovers to discuss business with Bet, developing an attraction to the brassy barmaid at the same time. In fact, he spent more time at the Rovers than the Graffiti, and the brewery decided to sack him from the Graffiti - not that he minded. After an enjoyable night out with Bet, Alec told her that he hoped they had a future together, but, offended by Bet's insinuation that he was only interested in her because he wanted the Rovers, Alec walked out of her life.\nAfter going on a Spanish tour with a cabaret package, Alec returned to Weatherfield and resumed contact with Bet. At that point, she had just been offered the tenancy of the Rovers by Newton & Ridley, but was unable to get a loan with affordable repayments, and faced losing the pub. Keen to help, Alec loaned Bet the £12,000 she needed, asking her to keep the deal a secret from the brewery. Afterwards, he proved a handful for Bet, with his ordering the staff around and using the back room as his office causing her to remind her that the Rovers was hers.\nIn May , Bet upped sticks, leaving behind a note for Alec blaming her disappearance on financial pressures. With Bet apparently untraceable, Alec tried to recover his money from the brewery, but his ally in the brewery, Cecil Newton , could only offer him the measly position of temporary manager in lieu of the tenancy being bought over. With his money tied up in the pub, Alec had no choice but to accept, and became the Rovers' seventh licensee.\nAs the Rovers' most sour-faced landlord yet took control, he wasted no time in putting his mark on the place. Out went Betty Turpin , who resigned when Alec kept watching her like a hawk when she so much as walked past the till, and in came Margo Richardson , a hand-picked barmaid replacement.\n1987 : Tracking Bet down in Torremolinos , Alec stuns her with a suggestion...\nFinally, in August , Bet got in touch with the brewery to arrange the repayment of the money, returning the tenancy to Newton & Ridley. As his financial arrangement was with Bet, Alec was told by Cecil Newton that it was up to him to contact her and get his money back. With only the knowledge that she was working at a bar in Torremolinos to go on, Alec flew out to Spain to track her down, leaving Gloria in charge of the Rovers. After spending the day searching hundreds of bars, Alec found Bet waiting tables at Mac's Bar . After initially fussing about his money, Alec surprised Bet by being gentle with her, showing concern that she didn't feel able to confide in him. When Bet lamented her failure as a landlady, Alec made the radical suggestion that they buy the tenancy together and run the Rovers as man and wife. The suggestion stunned Bet, who, knowing Alec, understood that this was as much a declaration of feelings as it was a business proposition, and although disappointed that his motivation hadn't been entirely romantic, she accepted his proposal, and the couple immediately returned home.\nBack in Weatherfield, Alec and Bet successfully lobbied for the Rovers tenancy, and set a date of 9th September for the wedding, at All Saints Church . Their engagement stunned friends and neighbours, with some expecting them to come to their senses and cancel, including Alec's best man Charles Halliday , who spent the stag night trying to put the bridegroom off marriage. However, the wedding went ahead without a hitch, and as a wedding present Alec told Bet the Rovers was hers.\n1987-1989: A marriage of convenience\nEdit\nA period of adjustment followed for the Gilroys . Their relationship having been mostly business beforehand, it wasn't until they got married that they really got to know each other, and their histories; after finding out that Bet had previously shared a house with Mike Baldwin and not told him, Alec felt he was the butt of the customers' jokes, and responded by making cracks about his wife's promiscuity, causing the couple to fall out. After a few days not speaking to each other, Alec made up with Bet, admitting that his trust issues were due to his incredulity at being married to her.\n1988 : The Gilroys share a tender moment when Bet loses the baby\nIn early 1988 , Bet broke the news to Alec that she was pregnant at forty-seven. Both were anxious about being parents at their ages, especially Alec to whom children were an alien species, but the thought of having a son or daughter who would be theirs saw them warm to the idea. Sadly, Bet had a miscarriage a few days later. The Gilroys mourned their baby together, admitting how much it had come to mean to them in that short space of time.\nAlec kept up his theatrical work, and was often seen negotiating with friends in the business using the phone in the Rovers hallway. In October 1987 , Alec was asked to assemble a troupe to entertain the British Army in Germany , resulting in his absence from the Rovers for a few weeks. In July 1988 , he set up his \"friend\" Gus Ferris with a duff act (Jack Duckworth) to put him in lumber with Margery Smith at the Old Band Club , causing Margery to drop Gus and come to Alec for acts in future. Alec kept Bet out of his agency business, not even telling her how much money he was making from the enterprise; when he was mugged on his way to the bank in September 1988 , and his briefcase containing the weekend's takings plus his club earnings, Bet was stunned to learn that it amounted to £2,134, and offered him help to spend all that money!\nThe insurance company paid out on Alec's losses from the mugging but his financial problems were to continue. In January 1989 , Wally Simpson offered Alec the job of managing a nine-week tour of the Middle East. He was going to accept, but when Bet showed her jealousy of his friendship with Megan Morgan (aka Tanya the Exotic Dancer ), who was also going on the trip, he decided to turn down the tour. Immediately afterwards, Alec's accountant Bernie Greenwood informed him that the Inland Revenue was onto him about his tax returns - due to Newton & Ridley disclosing his payments on his entertainment work for them, the tax office suspected Alec had undeclared earnings. Faced with the alternative of shopping his artistes who hadn't paid tax, and therefore losing his standing in the business, Alec did the unthinkable and paid £8,000 in unpaid tax on his artistes' behalf. To recover funds, Alec accepted the Middle East tour after all and departed right away.\n1989 : What has Bet been up to with Paul Rigby ?\nIn May , Alec returned home from the tour three weeks early, planning to surprise Bet, but instead he found the staff running the Rovers and Bet nowhere to  be found. Bet had gone out with Paul Rigby , husband of her friend Stella , and returned with him at midnight. Cross words were exchanged as Alec sent Paul packing and accused Bet of being unfaithful in his absence - Paul was a well-known womaniser and Alec refused to believe their dalliance was innocent, although Bet swore that there was nothing in it. Hoping to prompt a confession, Alec demanded a divorce, but instead Bet hit back at him by consulting a solicitor , asking for a divorce on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour. A battle of wills then followed between man and wife; Alec fired Bet from the Rovers and told Stella what had been going on behind her back, causing Stella to fall out with Bet, while Bet put off Alec's new housekeeper Mrs Hargreaves by telling her Alec was a sex maniac. However, Alec was mistaken in his belief that Bet had shopped him to the brewery when Nigel Ridley got wind of their marital problems - having actually been informed by Jack Duckworth, who wanted to take over the Rovers himself. When he accused Bet, Alec was surprised by her defeated attitude, and finally lowered his guard and admitted that he'd got it wrong, allowing the couple to make peace. Their reconciliation was heralded by a much-delayed honeymoon in Spain .\n1989-1991: The Gilroy connection\nEdit\n1990 : Alec is reunited with daughter Sandra after 19 years\nLater that year, the sudden death of an old act, Frankie Radcliffe , got Alec thinking about the his own legacy, and, feeling the shame of his absence from Sandra's life, he decided to track down his now grown-up daughter. Getting her address from Joyce, Alec found Sandra living in a massive house in Handforth , Cheshire , now married to solicitor Tim Arden , and mother to twelve-year-old Victoria . Tim and Victoria responded well to Alec but Sandra was merely shocked, giving no immediate impression whether she would welcome Alec back into her life. Giddy at the reunion, Alec made plans to get re-acquainted with his daughter, and having received an invite to her birthday party by Tim, dragged a nervous Bet along. Alec was aware that Bet had mixed feelings about the whole affair, so when she told him that she'd overheard Sandra telling Tim that she didn't want Alec there, he didn't believe her, despite her words being supported by the fact that Sandra hadn't made the effort to speak to Alec at the party. Hoping for something more intimate, Alec invited the Ardens to a meal at the Rovers, but when Sandra arrived, it was to tell Alec that she didn't want him to be a part of her life - he'd stayed away so long that his return meant nothing to her. A heartbroken Alec decided to respect Sandra's wishes, but Bet had a word with her and she agreed not to cut him off. Backing off, Alec contented himself with the occasional visit.\nIn May 1990 , the Gilroys faced their biggest crisis yet. With Cecil Newton retiring, Nigel Ridley made plans to turn the Rovers into Yankees , a New York -style theme bar, expanding into 1 Coronation Street which Deirdre Barlow had agreed to sell to the brewery. Having previewed the new bar and decided it wasn't for them, the Gilroys tried to oppose the move, causing Nigel to order them out of the Rovers. With the support of the neighbours, Alec and Bet protested by locking down the pub, with Alec at one point bodily ejecting Nigel from the premises. The story made waves in the local press, with the Gazette interviewing the Gilroys about their eviction  and the local radio station interviewing them from the upstairs window. However, it was a battle the Gilroys were doomed to lose, and the brewery eventually came to repossess the pub. Alec and Bet were moments away from eviction when Cecil Newton arrived and, reminding Nigel that he was still on the board, told him that he'd put a stop to his \"foolish young ideas\", and that the Rovers was to stay as it was, with Alec and Bet being kept on. Alec celebrated with free drinks all round - before putting the prices up the next day.\nAlec still hoped to make his fortune and he knew he would never make a penny running the Rovers. In February 1991 , he decided to go into business with Phil Jennings , setting up a club in the empty Graffiti building. Alec became so keen on the idea that he planned to sell the Rovers tenancy to go in with Phil, as he was only able to get a £30,000 loan from the bank, and together they came up with \"The Al-Phi-Bet Club\" as a name. However, Phil suddenly dumped the Gilroys, telling Alec he couldn't let them risk everything. The club never opened it doors but Alec still felt the need to retaliate and, remembering Deirdre selling them out to the brewery, managed Alf Roberts 's council election campaign when he was standing against Deirdre, with Phil managing her campain. Alf was successfully re-elected, reclaiming his council seat from Deirdre.\n1991 : Alec and Vicky grieve for Sandra\nIn July , Sandra informed Alec that Joyce had passed away. Alec decided not to attend the funeral, and instead look after Victoria while Sandra and Tim were at the funeral in Whitby . Alec and Bet were just about to leave to collect Victoria when a policeman called at the Rovers to break the news that the Ardens had both been killed in a car crash in Whitby. Alec told Victoria the news himself, and after a period of grief by both parties, discussion turned to Vicky's care. As Alec was her closest surviving relative, Vicky was placed at the Rovers, despite her wish to be among friends in Handforth. Vicky spent the weeks before going back to boarding school dejected and resentful of her dingy surroundings in Weatherfield , struggling to find common ground with her grandparents.\n1991-1996: Alec sets sail\nEdit\nAlec yearned for more glamorous surroundings, and in November a job for Sunglobe Shipping Company supplying six artistes for a cruise became much more when his chosen Master of Ceremonies, Archie Archer , dropped out, and Alec decided to take on the job himself, seeing it as a stepping stone to greater things. Bet stiffly opposed the idea, angry at the thought of Alec abandoning her over Christmas and New Year to go on holiday. After failing to win Bet over by laying on an early Christmas dinner, Alec left for Southampton to board his ship.\n1992 : Cherie Watkins meets the late Mrs Gilroy\nWhile on the cruise, Alec befriended Cherie Watkins , who was related to a director of the shipping company, and told her he was a widower so as not to put off the woman who was clearly interested in him. Just before Christmas, Bet summoned Alec home, however he claimed to be too busy. When he returned home in early January , he discovered that Bet had got a past love of hers, Des Foster , to decorate their bedroom, and that Des had tried it, resulting in Bet having to fight him off. Alec was initially skeptical but he believed Bet when she showed him the bruises she got fighting Des off, and with the truth out in the open Alec agreed to drop the subject. Shortly afterwards, it was Alec's turn to explain himself, when Bet intercepted a postcard from Cherie Watkins. Bet invited Cherie to tea and forced Alec to confess her the truth about being a widower by playing the role of Alec's mother (as Cherie had assumed she was when she heard she was \"Mrs. Gilroy\"), by bossing \"little Alec\" about, much to the embarrassment of both Alec and Cherie.\n1992 : \"It's you, Bet , it's you who's let me down\"\nAlec didn't expect to hear from Sunglobe again but in August , they contacted him out of the blue to ask him to manage their entertainment full-time, a job which would entail relocating to Southampton. Alec didn't need asking twice - the Rovers was neither fulfilling nor rewarding - and broke the news to his stunned wife, telling her he wanted to take it but that it would be a joint decision. Bet felt the pull of the Rovers, having worked there for 22 years, but after seeing Alec at his happiest in years, she agreed to go along with his plans. Alec then busiest himself with arrangements, selling the Rovers tenancy back to the brewery and announcing their departure to the regulars. However, on the day of departure, a forlorn Bet told her disbelieving husband that she was staying behind, and remaining at the Rovers as manager, having accepted initially only for his sake. Refusing to see his wife's point of view, Alec reacted angrily, accusing Bet of trying to blackmail him into staying and stifling his career. But Bet knew that Alec would still go, and as Alec drove off, he told Bet sternly that even though he was leaving, she was the one walking out on him.\nSettling into his new life, Alec accepted the demise of his marriage but he was so hurt by Bet's betrayal that he refused to get involved with another woman except for companionship.\nIn 1994 , Vicky left school and the following January she turned eighteen, whereupon she inherited her parents' fortune. As she'd moved in with Bet, Alec was absent throughout her financial dealings with ex-boyfriend Steve McDonald . Vicky had invested in Steve's print business Dun 2 A T and ended up losing money, but she remained with Steve as she hoped to drive him away from his girlfriend Fiona Middleton . In July , Vicky and Steve announced their engagement, and fearing that Steve - who had a history of messing Vicky about - was only after her for her money, Bet summoned Alec from Southampton. Returning to the Rovers for the first time in nearly three years, Alec teamed up with Bet to stop the wedding, although Alec's measures were more underhanded, such as asking Steve's debtor Frank Mottram to lean heavily on Steve, and inventing a clause in the Ardens' will which would give Alec control of Vicky's finances. In the end, Vicky and Steve fled to St. Lucia to marry there, and as an unusually sentimental Alec prepared to return to Southampton, he asked Bet if she would have him back. Though she'd enjoyed their reunion, Bet knew that he hadn't really changed and gently turned down his request.\nThe following year, Alec had to move on from the cruises after clashing with his new boss, who'd been promoted over his head. Taking the position of manager of the Weatherfield branch of Sunglobe, now renamed Sunliners Travel Agency , Alec returned to his old stomping grounds.\n1996-2002: Alec's greatest hits\nEdit\n1996 : The wanderer returns\nAlec had traded Coronation Street for a life on the seas and he returned to Weatherfield full of bluster about his grand lifestyle, enthusing to Vicky and Steve about his \"promotion\" up north when he arrived in April 1996 . Taking permanent lodgings at a B&B at 15 Park Road , run by ex-chorus girl Jessie Wilcox , Alec took control of the shop, recruiting Deirdre Rachid as an assistant and Joyce Smedley as cleaner. Sadly, his diminished circumstances were plain for all to see as former staff and customers visited his dump of a workplace.\nBy the time of Alec's return, Bet had resigned from the Rovers and left the area, and within a few weeks Vicky too moved on, taking a hotel management course in Lausanne , Switzerland , after a messy breakup with Steve which saw Steve jailed for two years for handling stolen whiskey and perverting the course of justice after trying to put the blame on Vicky.\nAfter Vicky's departure, Alec bought 12 Coronation Street flat above the Kabin . He still avoided getting too serious with women but he wasn't adverse to marrying if the right one came along, as he explained to Joyce Smedley, with whom he had rapidly become friends. Joyce agreed to accompany Alec on a break to the Lake District , where they slept in separate rooms, and was disappointed when Alec didn't make a move, but they reached an understanding when Alec explained to her how he'd been hurt in the past. Their friendship ended when Alec caught Joyce stealing from the Rovers and the travel agents, and sacked her when she threatened to blackmail him for having her invoice Sunliners for cleaning his flat.\nIf Sunliners wasn't the most invigorating workplace, Alec at least had more time to put into his agency. He hoped to find an act that would take him to the big time and started his search in Coronation Street, nurturing Fiona Middleton as a singer and Roy Cropper with his perfect memory. However, neither performer wanted to work with Alec and they had to go to extreme measures to put him off.\n1997 : Alec and Jack pose as draymen to get into the Rovers when Vera changes the locks\nAt Christmas , while Jack Duckworth was in hospital, Alec helped Vera out at the Rovers, which was now under Duckworth ownership. Vera swore Alec to secrecy, but Jack found out anyway and warned Alec to stay away from the Rovers and Vera. Made redundant from Sunliners the following May , Alec began sniffing around the Rovers, advising Rita against a 50/50 partnership with the Duckworths before offering them one himself for £17,000. With a VAT bill of £17,650 to settle, Jack got £25,000 out of Alec, with Alec ceding the accommodation to the Duckworths. It was an unprecedented partnership with no trust on either side, but unlike Jack and Vera who feared Alec was trying to push them out of the Rovers, Alec only had to worry about the Duckworths not pulling their weight. The relationship got off to a bad start, with Vera changing the locks upon finding out about the deal after her return from a holiday in Morecambe . Alec and Jack has to pose as draymen to get back in. Alec ran rings round the Duckworths with ease, making them pay to hold their 40th wedding anniversary at their own pub and billing Jack for all the free drinks.\nAnother of Alec's ventures was the Golden Years Agency , which offered escorts for companionship, although he was forced to lie low for a while when one of his clients, Babs Fanshawe , passed away during a meal with Ken Barlow .\nSince moving into the flat adjacent to Rita Sullivan's, Alec had become friendly with his former artiste, with Rita finally looking on him favourably after years of keeping him at arm's length. In July 1998 , when Rita was hospitalised with carbon monoxide poisoning, Alec felt responsible for her and tackled Steve McDonald about a gas fire he'd installed which was the cause of Rita's illness. When Rita was back on her feet, Alec confessed his growing feelings for her and proposed, however she fell out with him when he reported Steve to the Health and Safety people against her wishes, accusing Alec of using her to get back at Steve for what he did to Vicky. Soon afterwards, Rita started becoming forgetful due to the after-effects of the poisoning, and again Alec came to the rescue, taking over the Kabin and arranging for her to visit Mavis Wilton in Cartmel . Seeing that Alec genuinely cared about her, Rita cooked him a meal to clear the air, however she became annoyed when he proposed again as she was happy with things the way they were.\nAfter a spat with the Duckworths, Alec decided to end the partnership and return to Southampton, but in a surprising turn of events, Rita agreed to marry him after all, and Alec pushed for full ownership of the Rovers, offering them £30,000 for their half of the pub with the promise of keeping them on as staff and allowing them to stay on in the living quarters. The Duckworths agreed, but once Alec had total control, he decided to fire them, only holding back because he knew that Rita would find it despicable. Meanwhile, he and Rita decided to live together instead of getting married, with Alec building a door between their two flats so that they could come and go as they pleased.\n1998 : Alec gives the Duckworths their due as he leaves the Street in triumph\nAs Christmas loomed, Vicky paid Alec a Yuletide visit and told him about her plans to buy a wine bar in Brighton . Meanwhile, annoyed at the Duckworths' cheek at asking for Christmas off to visit their grandson Tommy in Blackpool , Alec decided to grant them the holiday and evict them from the Rovers in their absence. He had their belongings put in storage but, having been tipped off, Jack and Vera returned home on Christmas Eve and barricaded themselves in the living quarters. Alec decided to wait them out - they had to come down eventually - but when Rita told him that she was the one who warned the Duckworths as what he'd done to them was cruel, Alec became dispirited and told Rita he didn't want to see her anymore. Realising he had nothing to stay in Weatherfield for, Alec accepted an offer by Natalie Barnes to buy the pub, using the money to go into partnership with Vicky.  After boarding up the door in the flat, Alec left for Brighton, stopping only to congratulate the Duckworths on their much-earned victory.\nIn 2002 , Bet returned to Weatherfield and told the residents that she and Alec had got a divorce.\nPersonality\nEdit\nWhat is Alec scheming?\n\"You view people as opportunities - what you can get out of them, not what you can give them.\" - Bet Gilroy\nAlec entered the world of showbusiness as an artiste, performing onstage with ferrets. He honed his craft as a talent scout, learning to be savvy and devious enough to keep the Weatherfield Majestic supplied with acts. He dreamed of fame and fortune, but it never came, replaced with a stoic cynicism as he fought to survive in the dog-eat-dog world of showbusiness.\nClub management led naturally to the licenced trade and, eventually, the Rovers Return . He considered it a waste of his talent, but Alec ran the Rovers efficiently, treating the bar like a stage and putting the staff on their best behaviour, cracking the whip when required (usually snarkily). He was a workaholic; all of his time went towards running the pub, his agency, or meeting friends in the business. Bet even had to drag him away from his work to be physical with him.\nAlec was mean with money, and being a man so consumed by his work, he could come across as having no motive in life other than greed. He pocketed the wages of staff who no longer worked under him at the Rovers, and at Sunliners , he claimed Joyce Smedley 's salary even after she'd passed away. At the Rovers, double Scotch drinker Mike Baldwin was always met with a smile and chit-chat, while Percy Sugden was left in the cold to nurse his half-a-mild.\nUnderneath his prickly exterior, Alec was a sensitive man, though few people got to see this side of him. He kept people at a distance emotionally to avoid heartbreak; his separation from Bet was so painful that for a few years he only had lady companions. He liked a laugh, although it was usually at someone's expense. Ultimately, it was his ruthlessness in getting what he wanted which alienated him from some of the most important people in his life.\nTraits\nEdit\nAlec was short (although he described himself as \"slightly above medium\") and wore glasses. He smoked heavily, often to steady his nerves. In 1988 , he claimed he disliked holidays which were \"too foreign\".\nAlec had a fear of dogs. When Bet took in an Alsatian guard dog, Rover , from the RSPCA, Alec paid Tommy Ferguson to say it was his missing dog. However, he didn't mind spiders, as evidenced by him hiring a £500 Mexican mouse-eating spider to display in the Rovers to stir up trade. The escapade ended when the spider got loose and Alec had to squash it with his bare hands without being noticed during an inspection by the health inspector.\nRelationships\nEdit\n1995 : Alec comperes on the QE2 , with his half-sister Brenda\n\"I'm not the exhibitionist type, Bet . Come to think of it, I don't think I even said I love me own mother.\"\nAll Alec got from his father Reg was a propensity for penny-pinching and being in public houses (albeit on opposite sides of the bar). Reg left Alec's mother Mabel for another woman when Alec and his sister Edna were children. They were reunited many years later, when Reg got in touch with Alec out of guilt when he thought Reg was dying, and introduced him to his 27-year-old half-sister Brenda .\nAlec's theatrical bent arose from competition with his sister Edna, although, like his parents, Edna played no part in Alec's adult life. However, he kept in touch with Brenda and helped her out by giving her work in the entertainment industry as Melody Lane , including a prestigious spot on the QE2 in December 1995 , despite her questionable level of talent.\nRita Sullivan\nEdit\n1975 : Alec signs Rita to his new agency\nWhen Alec settled in Coronation Street in 1986 , Rita Fairclough was the only person he knew from the \"old days\"; they'd collaborated a few times in the 1970s in their respective roles of impresario and singer. During her short time on Alec's books, Rita found Alec and his showbiz pals dodgy, claiming that she only survived it as she was old enough to know her way around. When Jenny Bradley sang for Alec, hoping he would sign her up, Rita told Alan her experiences and advised him to put a stop to it.\nRita and Alec crossed paths only rarely during his and Bet 's marriage; early in their romance, Rita advised Bet not to get involved with Alec, telling her he was rotten to the core, but Bet ignored her friend's advice. In 1989 , concerned friends learned of a missing Rita's whereabouts when she turned up at The Strand Hotel in Blackpool , which was run by a friend of Alec's, Cyril Partridge , and Cyril rang Alec.\nRita's opinion of Alec began to change when they were on a cruise together in December 1995 . Having been dismissive of him the entire journey, Rita was surprised to learn that a talentless singer he'd given a spot to on the QE2 was not a woman with whom he was having an affair, but his sister Brenda, and also that he'd given his cabin to Curly and Raquel Watts . They shared a rare moment of understanding, with Alec confessing that he'd pocketed money owed to her when she worked for him and that he hadn't sold her contract to a big London agent who could have taken her to the top. His kindness and candour went a long way to convincing Rita that the heartless money-grabber she used to know had changed.\nAlec and Rita became closer upon Alec's full-time return to Weatherfield in 1996 . Spending more time finding new talent for his agency, Alec sometimes asked Rita her opinion on acts, and she agreed to coach Fiona Middleton as a singer. Their newfound friendship was noticed by Rita's would-be suitor Fred Elliott , though at that point Rita insisted her relationship with Alec was strictly business. In 1998 , after Rita's carbon monoxide ordeal, Alec's intentions became more serious, and Alec decided he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Rita. It was only with time - and two proposals - that he managed to win Rita over, but when his battle with the Duckworths became more heated, Rita saw the old Alec emerge and decided to warn Jack and Vera that Alec was going to evict them from the Rovers while they were away. When she confessed to Alec, Alec immediately turned against her, proving to her that he hadn't really changed. Alec left Weatherfield without saying goodbye to her.\nIn 2002 , when Bet Lynch returned to the area, Rita broached the subject of her engagement to Alec, causing Bet to reveal that Alec had described the entire ordeal as him \"going through a nostalgic phase\".\nBet Gilroy\nEdit\n1987 : Alec and Bet behind the bar\nAlec and Bet Lynch crossed paths very briefly when Alec drank at the Rovers in 1975 when Bet was working behind the bar. Eleven years later, Bet was a year into her stewardship of the Rovers and still finding her feet in the job. Meanwhile, Alec was a dab hand in the licence trade and would seem to be a good fit in the flashy Graffiti Club , but in fact his was a lonely and dull job. Their relationship started out professionally - they were colleagues in the trade, and friendly rivals. Alec was attracted to Bet, and slowly moved their relationship in a more personal direction, while Bet appreciated Alec's agency help and advice and gradually began to trust him.\nAlec and Bet had never properly dated before they became engaged; Alec fell out with Bet when he found out she thought he was using her to get to the Rovers. Their interactions afterwards were purely financial, although Alec demonstrated a great deal of faith in Bet by loaning her the money to buy the Rovers tenancy. Bet proved to be a financial risk but after recovering his losses, Alec offered marriage so that she could remain landlady. Alec was proposing a real marriage but, keeping his feelings for Bet close to his chest, he seemed to Bet to be suggesting a marriage of convenience. However, Bet knew that Alec was serious about her, and even though his proposal could have been more romantic, Bet accepted, and they were married on 9th September 1987 .\nAlec and Bet couldn't have been more different. Bet was a fun-loving barmaid, sassy, and popular with the customers, and her pint-sized husband morose and miserly. They had in common a jaded, unsentimental outlook on life, which both helped them bond and gave rise to many catty exchanges between the pair. The spice of the Gilroy marriage was Alec and Bet's power games, with man and wife conspiring to get one over on each other. For example, in December 1988 , Alec found out from Paul Rigby that Bet and Stella successful turn at a health farm had actually been a disaster, with the women dropping out of the regime and spending the rest of their time feasting in a hotel. Alec got a kick out of making Bet talk about the health farm at every opportunity and going on about it in front of the customers, although Bet soon cottoned on and pretended to book the health farm for Alec to scare him.\nThe practicality of the Gilroy marriage both guaranteed its survival but also doomed it from the outset. When Alec got the opportunity to move to Southampton and manage the entertainment on the cruise ships, it was the move he'd been waiting for. At first, Bet went along with his plans, not having the heart to ask him not to take it, but her doubts were overwhelming and she decided to remain at the Rovers. When she broke the news to Alec, Alec accused her of trying to blackmail him into staying, but Bet knew that Alec would still go - he'd always done what he wanted. As he left for pastures new, Alec told Bet that she was the one walking out on their marriage, however much she tried to blame him.\nDuring Alec's brief return to Weatherfield in 1995 , he and Bet put their own feelings aside to concentrate on stopping Vicky Arden from marrying Steve McDonald . Although Bet enjoyed having Alec around again, his presence made her certain that she'd done the right thing three year earlier; he viewed people as opportunities, and she was no exception.\nJack Duckworth\nEdit\nAlec was introduced to one Jack Duckworth when the Rovers cellarman asked him for a job at the Graffiti Club just after the Rovers fire. Reeking of desperation for work, Jack had nothing to recommend him but Alec seized upon his boast that most of the customers only went into the Rovers because of him; subject to him bringing that custom to the Graffiti, Alec agreed to take Jack on. Jack won the challenge by buying people free drinks at the establishment, but his employment at the Graffiti only lasted for a few weeks, as he returned to a refurbished Rovers when it opened.\nJack became a regular thorn in Alec's side when Alec became Rovers licensee. Lazy, shifty, and incompetent, \"Jacko\" was only useful for doing the donkey work. When Alec was in a bad mood, Jack was the usual recipient of his vitriol, although Alec was insulting and snappy with his instructions in any mood, often getting in jibes about Jack being henpecked by Vera . Jack was a perennial suck-up, and so he always took what Alec threw at him, but occasionally he would show loyalty to Newton & Ridley over the Gilroys, such as in 1989 when he informed the brewery about their break-up in hope of being offered the Rovers himself. Their relationship wasn't entirely acrimonious, however, with the pair often sharing their musings on the strange phenomenon of women.\n1992 : Jack tries to hide from Alec when he moonlights as a pallbearer\nA notable incident involving the pair occurred in March 1992 . Secretly working as a pallbearer, Jack feigned back trouble to get a day off work so he could do a funeral. Unluckily for Jack, it was one of Alec's friends who had died, and, when the pair made eye contact in the graveyard, Jack abandoned his post and ran off, with Alec giving chase. Jack made it home and covered himself up in a blanket, which fooled Alec when he arrived there moments later, intending to catch him out, but his eagle-eyed employer spotted the muddy shoes and sacked Jack on the spot for moonlighting. Fortunately, Alec was adverse to cellar work and Jack managed to grovel his way back into the Rovers.\nLater, as business partners, Alec and Jack got on better; two years of being lord and master of the Rovers had taught Jack a thing or two, and he'd developed the confidence to put Alec in his place. The Alec of this period was a man biding his time, waiting patiently for his opportunity to oust the Duckworths for good, but keeping them sweet in the meantime.\nBetty Turpin\nEdit\n\"There's no getting rid of her, is there? She should be written into the deeds of this place.\"\nBusiness was no place for sentiment, and when Alec first arrived at the Rovers, one member of staff who stood out for all the wrong reasons was 67-year-old Betty Turpin , the pub's longest-serving barmaid and hotpot queen. Alec saw Betty as the most expendable member of the Rovers staff, and any staffing crisis would invariably see Alec try to force her into retirement.\nTheir first clash came when Alec first took over the Rovers as manager in 1987 , when Betty walked out because of Alec watching her whenever she went over to the till, despite her stainless record at the pub in her years of loyal service. Bet managed to persuade Betty to return while Alec was off sick, and got him to be nicer to Betty as they needed her in the kitchen. However, even Betty's famous hotpot wasn't safe from Alec; he once tried to get her to put more salt in the recipe to make the customers thirsty, but Betty was having none of it. In 1992 , when the Health and Safety people were onto the Rovers about the state of the kitchen, Alec decided to stop serving food and unceremoniously fired Betty. Once again, she wasn't gone for long, as profits fell so much without her cooking that Alec decided to invest in a new kitchen and grovelled to Betty to get her to return. Alec made another attempt to oust her in 1997 when he got sick of her taking time off due to illness. He wrote Betty a note telling her she was fired and posted it through her letterbox, however he then had to retrieve it when Betty's husband Billy Williams passed away that same day. After the funeral, Vera Duckworth promised Betty a job for life.\n1998 : Not what it looks like\nAlec and Betty's closest encounter came on a night in 1998 , when Alec returned home feeling randy and climbed into bed in the dark with who he thought was Rita, but was actually Betty, who was staying at Rita's while the decorators were working at her house. Betty woke up and hit Alec with a pillow.\nVicky Arden\nEdit\n1990 : Alec tackles a \"stupid little brat\"\nWhen Alec was introduced to his 12-year-old grand-daughter Victoria Arden by his son-in-law Tim , it was the second time he'd seen her that day; earlier, while stopped in a country lane, Alec had sharply reversed his car, nearly hitting Victoria while she was riding her pony Saracen . Steadying the horse, Vicky tetchily reminded Alec that there were \"country codes for motorists\" and made him switch off his car's engine until she'd made her way down the lane. Alec then moved off, labelling her a \"stupid little brat\" under his breath as he continued his search for his daughter Sandra 's house in Fernwood Place, Handforth .\nVictoria (or \"Vicky\") was the apple of her grandfather's eye from their first (proper) meeting. The same age as Sandra when Alec split from Joyce, Vicky was a reminder to Alec of his failure as a father. She brought out his softer side, and they rarely exchanged a cross word. Occasionally Alec's mask slipped, such as in April 1992 when Vicky discovered that Alec had charged her estate for most of the cost of Saracen's new saddle which he had supposedly bought as a Christmas present, Alec having been unwilling to pay the full price.\nSandra and Tim's deaths meant that Alec's role in Vicky's life was more parental than grandparental. In 1992, when he caught Vicky kissing Steve McDonald , he warned Steve off as Steve was three years older than Vicky and had a criminal record. Shortly before leaving for Southampton , he caught Steve with another girl and told Vicky, ending their relationship. By 1995 , Steve was living a lifestyle beyond his means, and Vicky was willfully funding his business interests, having recently turned eighteen and inherited her parents' estate. When they decided to get married, Alec visited to make sure she didn't go through with it, doing everything he could think of from luring her away to Southampton to \"discuss\" the wedding, to offering Steve a lucrative job on the cruise ships and £5,000 to stay away from Vicky, all of which failed. Before leaving for Southampton, Alec remarked to Bet that he wasn't surprised that Vicky stuck to her guns - she was a Gilroy.\nAlec maintained a good relationship with Vicky throughout her troubles with Steve but his return to Weatherfield was marred by her rapid decision to move on from the area. In 1999 , they opened a restaurant in Brighton together, however in November of that year Alec missed Vicky's wedding to Robert due to being held up in Dubai .\nBackground information\n1986 : Roy Barraclough finally joins Coronation Street full-time on his seventh stint in the programme\nRoy Barraclough was a Preston -born actor who began his career as a draughtsman, performing in local amateur dramatics groups in his spare time. He eventually quit to pursue an acting career, and trod the boards in repertory in Huddersfield , Stoke-on-Trent and Oldham , where he developed a love of the theatre. In the 1960s , he branched out into television, making a number of appearances on programmes for Granada and YTV , usually in guest parts.\nIn Episode 1194 , transmitted on 26th June 1972 , Barraclough made his debut appearance as Alec Gilroy, appearing in both of that week's episodes. At that point, Barraclough was one of Coronation Street 's most prolific bit part actors, having appeared in four previous episodes in different roles: a Blue John Mines Tour Guide in June 1965 , an electric guitar salesman in July 1967 , window cleaner I-spy Dwyer in June 1968 and finally restaurant-diner Harry in June 1970 . A four-episode reprisal of the character in 1975 cemented Barraclough's role as Alec, but with the actor enjoying success as part of a comedy partnership with Les Dawson , producers failed to tie him down to a regular role.\nIn 1986 , the producership of John G. Temple and Bill Podmore (as executive producer ) finally persuaded Barraclough to sign for the Street full-time, granting him eight weeks off a year to do a play. On signing the actor, Bill Podmore recalls: \"It was never a great problem inducing Roy to make a fleeting visit to Weatherfield . The tough job was persuading him to stay. While many actors would give their right arm to land a Coronation Street contract, Roy's terrific talent meant he was rarely short of work, either on stage or the more lucrative television, and he was not easily tempted.\" (Coronation Street: The Inside Story, Bill Podmore, 1990) Episode 2632 (23rd June 1986) was Alec's first appearance as a regular.\nPartnership with Bet\nEdit\nAlec appeared initially as manager of the Graffiti Club in Rosamund Street - a temporary home to the Rovers regulars while the pub was renovated - but writers quickly decided to focus on his sparring relationship with Bet Lynch . Barraclough enjoyed playing Alec's nasty side, and was surprised at the direction writers took the character: \"The public loved to hate Alec because he was such a devious so-and-so and was up to every scam in the book. The viewers loved all that roguery, I think. Of course, when he got together with Bet he was really up against it because she had the measure of his craftiness. \" (Fifty Years of Coronation Street, Headline Publishing Group, 2010).\nIn 1987 , Alec's relationship with Bet became more serious, and the couple decided to marry in what was the Street's unlikeliest marriage to date, with Alec becoming licensee of the Rovers. The decision stunned Barraclough and Julie Goodyear , who both had misgivings: \"They were a most unlikely couple. I think that Julie and I both thought that. I wasn't very enamoured with the idea because I thought that the marriage, however unlikely it was, would of necessity mellow the characters down and I thought there was more fun to be had with the sharp banter that they had before.\" (The Coronation Street Story, Boxtree Limited, 1995) However, Podmore, who had recently returned to the position of producer , believed the comic potential of the pairing to be worth it: \"Julie Goodyear's natural flair for comedy and Alec's droll, expressive face have produced some memorable moments. Theirs may have seemed an improbable match, but like Emily Bishop and Percy Sugden they make a perfect odd couple, and a fertile area for comedy writing.\" (Coronation Street: The Inside Story)\n1987 : Alec and Bet marry for the Rovers\nAlec's proposal to Bet was shot on location in Torremolinos , where Bet had been living for three months (as Julie Goodyear had been granted compassionate leave earlier that year to look after her seriously ill mother). When the time came to record the wedding, Roy Barraclough's mind was on matters more material: \"These seamstresses had toiled for weeks, creating this Emmanuel-style wedding dress. I mean, if she fell off the Forth Bridge, she could have quite happily parachuted to safety. Yet there was no one available to hem up my trousers for the wedding suit. They were like concertinas, round the shoes, and in desperation the floor manager rushed forward and turned them up with sellotape. There I stood, with a crowd of what must have been 300 members of the public, who'd gathered outside the church to watch this very special wedding being filmed with these awful trousers.\" (The Coronation Street Story)\nDespite his doubts, the benefits of Alec and Bet marrying were not lost on Roy Barraclough. Reflecting on his screen marriage, Barraclough: \"He was very much taken with Bet, and marriage has changed him... For Alec, in that seedy little area, Bet represented showbusiness. She was the only one around there with style, panache, theatricality. Julie and I have worked very hard at making the two characters work as a couple, but we already knew each other so well. I performed at Oldham Rep more than 20 years ago when she was an assistant stage manager there and we've always been good friends and had a natural rapport and share the same, rather bizarre sense of humour. We have a lot of fun in rehearsals and joke a lot, which leads to a very relaxed atmosphere.\" (Life in the Street, Boxtree Limited, 1991)\nRoy Barraclough calls time\nRoy Barraclough /Alec behind the Rovers bar\nIn 1988 , with his contract due to expire, Barraclough decided to quit the programme, citing typecasting as a reason for his departure. His exit storyline was in early planning stages when he had a surprise change of heart, as Bill Podmore recalls: \"He insisted on leaving before he became better known as Alec Gilroy than Roy Barraclough, and all my efforts to dissuade him failed. Suddenly, out of the blue, he had a change of heart and the scriptwriters were spared the task of inventing a plausible exit for Bet's tubby hubby. To this day I don't know what brought about the change of mind.\" (Coronation Street: The Inside Story) Barraclough references this in a 1990 interview: \"For the foreseeable future, I will continue playing Alec because I'm enjoying it, but two years ago I thought I was going to pack it all in. The actor's instinct is to do it, move on and tackle another challenge. With soap, once you have established the character, it's just a case of learning a different situation each week. There's nothing else to explore. But Granada outlined all sorts of interesting ideas they had to develop the character and it sounded smashing.\" (Life in the Street)\nOne of the new ideas for Alec was to introduce his estranged daughter Sandra . For this storyline, Alec's backstory was changed from established history (given in Episode 2810 ) that he and first wife Joyce had separated while Joyce was still pregnant, to them divorcing when Sandra was thirteen years old. In 1991 , Chloe Newsome became a permanent addition to the cast, playing Alec's grand-daughter Vicky Arden (originally played by Helen Warburton in 1990 ).\nHowever, Barraclough remained non-committal about his future with Coronation Street, a situation not helped by the addition of a third weekly episode in October 1989 . Barraclough: \"It's damned hard work. If you're featured prominently in a storyline for five or six weeks, the pressure begins to get to you and the strain really starts to tell. It's very much bed and work. At the moment it's OK, but one could foresee a time when it could all get too much. I spent my life permanently tense.\" (Life in the Street) Roy Barraclough had another short absence from the Street over Christmas 1991.\nIn 1992 , Barraclough quit the Street, and this time he didn't change his mind. Although he expressed a desire for Alec to be killed off, writers instead chose to send him away to Southampton to resume his entertainment career, believing that Bet's new status as a separated woman had dramatic potential. Barraclough's first part after leaving was in Feed, a Tom Elliott -penned play at Bolton 's Octagon Theatre.\nComebacks\nEdit\n1996 cast portrait of Alec\nWhen Julie Goodyear decided to leave Coronation Street after 25 years in 1995 , Roy Barraclough was persuaded to return as Alec for a storyline which saw the Gilroys reunite to stop Vicky marrying Steve McDonald . The story saw Bet and Alec pick up where they left off, entertaining viewers with their bickering one last time.\nAlec next appeared in direct-to-video Coronation Street - The Feature Length Special , also in 1995, before returning to the regular programme full-time from April 1996 . Initially returning as manager of the local branch of Sunliners Travel Agency , Alec was eventually moved to his former position at the Rovers, this time opposite Jack and Vera Duckworth .\nOn 1st September 1998 , tabloids carried the story of Barraclough's resignation from the Street, with The Mirror carrying a quote from the actor: \"It's true I've told them I want to go at the end of my six month contract. It's hard work these days and I've just completed a 19 week stint at the studios.\" Episode 4534 , transmitted on 30th December , was his final appearance.\nIn The Stars of the Street, a countdown of the top fifty Coronation Street characters released on DVD in 2010 , Alec was ranked at #37.\nQuotes\n\"I've told Len you're here, he's just finishing a break in the games room.\" (First line, to Alan and Elsie Howard )\n---\n\n"
