St. Vitus Dance - Miami Vice Wiki - Wikia St. Vitus Dance | Miami Vice Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nEdit\nLiving on a yacht in a Miami marina helped Crockett to keep his lives as an undercover detective and drug dealing middleman Sonny Burnett separate. The lack of a fixed address also helped him to stay \"off the radar\" and made him harder to find, even when the St. Vitus was docked at its usual berth, and Crockett's watch-gator Elvis helped ensure anyone who did find his home was given a hostile welcome. The yacht provided Crockett with an unorthodox residence for entertaining his (usually female) guests, as seen frequently in the series; both Gina and Theresa Lyons regularly stayed on the yacht, and associates from his undercover work, such as Jake Pierson , would often visit him there to discuss business.\nOccasionally, Crockett's yacht played a more active role in his assignments, such as when he used it to \"vanish\" witnesses Al Lombard in \" Lombard \" or Keith Mollis in \" Line of Fire \", taking them out to sea on the St. Vitus where it would be more difficult for potential hitmen to find and get close to them. In the latter operation, the sailboat was badly shot up by gunmen from the Cantero organisation when they discovered its location due to a departmental leak, firing on the yacht from a helicopter. The vessel was apparently repaired soon after, as Crockett continued to use it as his residence for the remainder of the series, finally saying goodbye when he quit the Metro-Dade police force at the end of \" Freefall \".\nReal Boats\nEdit\nThe St. Vitus was portrayed by three different yachts during the course of the show's five seasons. In the pilot episode , Crockett lived on a Cabo Rico 38 sailboat, which changed to an Endeavour 40 once the show was picked up as a series. At the start of season 2 , the boat changed to a larger Endeavour 42, although some footage of the Endeavour 40 was still used in some episodes (likely stock footage filmed during season 1 ). By season 3 , the Endeavour 42 was the only boat seen, and would remain so for the rest of the series. It was never stated on the show if these boats were supposed to be the same yacht, or whether they were supposed to be three different vessels each christened the St. Vitus Dance -- however, the use of both the 40 and the 42 during season 2 implies the former.\nNotes\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n... and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named \"St. Vitus' Dance ... vice detective turned ... power-boat, called The 43 ft Scarab Don Johnson ...

Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series Miami Vice (1984), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James \"Sonny\" Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer Michael Mann , paired Johnson with the equally cool Philip Michael Thomas as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of Edward James Olmos as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named \"St. Vitus' Dance\" with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, \"Miami Vice\" had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world's favorite cop. For his work on \"Miami Vice\" Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.\nJohnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son Eva Lea (Wilson), a beautician, and Freddie Wayne Johnson, a farmer. As a kid, he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic A Boy and His Dog (1975). During the late 1960s and early 70s, Johnson had two short-lived marriages that were annulled; the names of his first two wives have never been made public. Tippi Hedren , Johnson's co-star in The Harrad Experiment (1973), allowed him to date her daughter Melanie Griffith despite the fact that she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. In the 1980s he lived with actress Patti D'Arbanville and they had one son together. He remarried Griffith in 1989, but divorced in 1996 when she left him for Antonio Banderas . Johnson has been married to fifth wife Kelly Phleger since 1999, and they have three children together.\nJohnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on \"Miami Vice\", which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show, one of them co-starring Melanie Griffith. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in the critically acclaimed TV film The Long Hot Summer (1985), an adaptation of the William Faulkner novel, and the film Sweet Hearts Dance (1988) with Susan Sarandon . After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like Dead Bang (1989), The Hot Spot (1990) and Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like John Frankenheimer , Sidney Lumet and Dennis Hopper .\nAfter working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show Nash Bridges (1996). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred Cheech Marin and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe . Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD's Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After \"Nash Bridges\" went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continues to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama Just Legal (2005), which was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer , and has traveled to Europe to make such films as the Norwegian screwball comedy Long Flat Balls II (2008) and the Italian films Bastardi (2008) and Torno a vivere da solo (2008). He will soon be seen in the romantic comedy When in Rome (2010) with Anjelica Huston and Danny DeVito , as well as the indie comedy A Good Old Fashioned Orgy (2011). 'Don Johnson (I)' starred in the 2007 feature film, _\"Moondance Alexander\" (2007)_, along with Lori Loughlin , Kay Panabaker , James Best , Sasha Cohen , and Whitney Sloan .\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: John Russell\nSpouse (5)\nGravelly voice\nTrivia (48)\nMade his professional debut in the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco, in \"Your Own Thing\", a rock musical modeled after William Shakespeare 's \"Twelfth Night\".

He was really unsure about how the heavy use of pastel and bright colors would fit the macho, no-nonsense persona of his character, but producer Michael Mann and costume designer Jodie Lynn Tillen managed to convince him. They saw Crockett more in the lines of a beach bum. Johnson relented and as a result became one of the biggest fashion symbols of the 1980s.\nHe and Tom Cruise were the premier faces of the Ray Ban brand of sunglasses during the 1980s. None of them took part in any official campaigns, but simply by clever product placement strategies both helped boost Ray Ban's sales enormously.

Don Johnson - Miami Vice Wiki - Wikia Don Johnson | Miami Vice Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nMelanie Griffith (1976, 1989-1996)\nKelley Phleger (1999-present)\nDonnie Wayne \"Don\" Johnson (born December 15, 1949), is an American actor with a long career in films and television. He made his acting debut in 1970, but it wasn't until 1984 he landed his defining role as Detective James \"Sonny\" Crockett in Miami Vice , for which he received a Golden Globe award and an Emmy nomination. He would later return to the police genre in 1996 for the lead role in Nash Bridges (for which he was also executive producer along with Carlton Cuse, creator of Lost). He has also had a recording, songwriting, and directing career.\nContents\nEdit\nJohnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri in 1949. His father was a farmer while his mother was a beautician. At the age of 6, he moved from Missouri to Wichita, Kansas, where he graduated from Wichita South High School in 1967 and attended the University of Kansas. In the late 1960s, he was one of the contestants on the popular television show The Dating Game, and was in a psychedelic rock band called Horses. Also in the band were future members of the band Kingfish, which featured Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir. The band put out one self-titled record on the White Whale label in 1969, later re-issued in 2004 & 2005.\n1970s-1980s\nEdit\nJohnson studied drama at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. His first role as Smitty in the Los Angeles stage show Fortune and Men's Eyes led to his film debut in 1970's The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart. He went on to other roles in Zachariah, The Harrad Experiment (where he first met Melanie Griffith ), Return to Macon County and the sci-fi cult classic A Boy and His Dog, for which he shared the first Saturn Award (for the scifi/horror genre) for Best Actor with James Caan for Rollerball. He appeared on television police dramas such as The Rookies, The Streets of San Francisco, Police Story and Barnaby Jones, and filmed several pilots for NBC, none of which were picked up. By 1984, Johnson was stuck in obscurity.\nMiami Vice\nEdit\nJohnson as Sonny Crockett\nJohnson got his big break when he was cast as James \"Sonny\" Crockett, the leadrole in Miami Vice. Johnson's character was an undercover Vice detective. To maintain his cover as a high dollar drug middleman, he wore Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton shirts and shoes with no socks, while maintaining what was known as \"designer stubble\". He drove luxurious, exotic sports cars, including a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona and a Ferrari Testarossa , and he lived on a sailing yacht in a Miami harbour called the St. Vitus Dance with his pet alligator Elvis .\nHis success in the role led to other opportunities such as the 1985 TV remake of The Long, Hot Summer featuring Cybill Sheppard. It also led to a tense salary dispute between the second and third seasons of Vice that disrupted the filming schedule and resulted in Michael Mann issuing Johnson an ultimatum: return to the show or be replaced. Johnson ultimately relented and returned to work for far less money than he had hoped for, but the delay caused the third season premiere, \" El Viejo \" to be pushed back to later in the season, creating a famous continuity goof regarding his Ferrari Daytona.\nWhile working on Vice, Johnson had a career in powerboat racing and won the APBA World Cup in the superboat class in 1988. Johnson also took an active role in the production of Miami Vice—he directed four episodes of the show (one in each season from the second through to the fifth), and his friendship with Tim Truman was allegedly instrumental in the composer's recruitment to the show as Jan Hammer 's replacement for season five. In that final season, Johnson's role as Crockett was reduced to just minor appearances in several of the episodes as he worked on his music career and sought other opportunities due to the series' impending cancellation.\nMusic career\nEdit\nIn the late 1970s, Johnson co-wrote two songs that appeared on the Allman Brothers Band's album Enlightened Rogues. During Miami Vice's run, Johnson recorded his first solo album, Heartbeat, the title cut from that album reached the Billboard Top 10 in 1986 and the album went gold. He released a duet with then-girlfriend Barbra Striesand, Till I Loved You, which reached the Top 30 in 1988, and his final solo album, Let It Roll was released in 1989 and did not chart, though his remake of \" Tell It Like It Is \" (which was featured in Miami Vice in the original version by Aaron Neville ) was a minor hit in Europe. Johnson also performed a song, \" Streetwise \", for the the episode of the same name , featuring Olivia Brown and Whoopi Goldberg on backing vocals, and sang on a Tim Truman song, \" No Way Out \", used in the series finale \" Freefall \".\nAfter Vice/Nash Bridges\nEdit\nAfter Miami Vice was cancelled in 1989, Johnson once again returned to films, appearing with then-wife Melanie Griffith in Paradise and Born Yesterday, and with Rebecca De Mornay in Guilty as Sin. In 1996, just as his marriage to Griffith was ending, he returned to television in the starring role of Carlton Cuse's Nash Bridges, as well as co-Executive Producer. Bridges was a detective in the San Francisco Police's Special Investigations Unit (SIU), alongside Cheech Marin. Johnson once again got a sports car to drive, a 1971 Plymouth HemiCuda. Philip Michael Thomas reunited with Johnson in two episodes, playing a DEA agent from Miami. The series ran for six years until CBS cancelled it in 2001. In 2005, the WB network brought Johnson back in a series, Just Legal, as a veteran lawyer paired with a young partner, although the show was cancelled after just three episodes. Afterwards Johnson moved to London for the West End production of Guys and Dolls, appearing as Nathan Detroit in 2007, then returned to television in the cable series Eastbound & Down (2010-2013) and From Dusk to Dawn: The Series (2014-2015, with Esai Morales ), then to network television in the series Blood & Oil in 2015.\nSonny Crockett in Nike's 2010 commercial\nJohnson's more recent roles have been notably tongue-in-cheek. In 2010, he appeared in a Nike commercial with basketball star LeBron James, sporting James \"Sonny\" Crockett 's trademark white blazer, pastel pink T-shirt and \"designer stubble\"; although he went unnamed in the advert, the prominent use of \" Crockett's Theme \" for background music left no doubt as to who the character was supposed to be. Later in the year, Johnson returned to cinema with a role as a US border vigilante in Robert Rodriguez's Machete—despite still enjoying lasting fame for his role as Crockett more than 25 years before, the film's opening credits humorously stated that it was \"introducing Don Johnson\", as if for the first time. Johnson's most recent movie roles were in 2012's Django Unchained and 2014's The Other Woman and Alex of Venice.\nPersonal life\nEdit\nJohnson met Melanie Griffith in 1973 during filming of The Harrad Experiment, which also starred Griffith's mother, Tippi Hedren. They were married briefly in 1976. Johnson was also involved with Lynn Whitfield and famous rock groupie Pamela Des Barres in the 1970s. In 1981, he began a four year relationship with Patti D'Arbanville that would produce a son, Jesse Johnson, in 1982. After Johnson & D'Arbanville's relationship ended, Griffith appeared in the Miami Vice episode \" By Hooker by Crook \", and the steamy love scene rekindled their romance, though it took two years to foster. In 1988, Johnson had a relationship with Barbra Striesand, during which she had a uncredited walk through role in Vice. In 1989, Griffith and Johnson remarried, and had a daughter, Dakota (Fifty Shades of Grey). They would divorce again in 1996 and while Griffith married Antonio Banderas, Johnson later met and married his current wife, Kelley Phleger, a San Francisco socialite. With Phleger he has three children: daughter Atherton Grace (born 1999) and sons Jasper (born 2002) and Deacon (born 2006). In 2008, Johnson barely avoided foreclosure on his Colorado home, paying off a $14.5 million debt less than 24 hours before the property was to go under the auctioneer's hammer.  In January, 2013, Johnson was awarded $15 million after a long legal battle with the company (Rysher Entertainment) that produced Nash Bridges.  Johnson was originally awarded $50 million by a jury in 2010 but that award was appealed and the settlement was reached.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nDetective Ricardo Tubbs..... ...

Belinda Montgomery\nCaitlin Davies (1987-1988)..... Sheena Easton\nSYNOPSIS\nThe pulse and rhythm of a glamorous resort city was set against the seamy side of the drug underworld in this action series, which made use of rock music and music video effects.\nSonny Crockett was a rough Miami vice detective who lived on a sailboat called St. Vitus' Dance which was guarded by his pet alligator, Elvis. Ricardo Tubbs was an ex-New York street cop who had come to Florida to find the drug dealer who murdered his brother. They were an unlikely - but very effective - team, working undercover on the upscale Gold Coast and the seedy alleyways that made Miami a city of contrasts.\nThey were often seen speeding around town in Sonny's black Ferrari Spider which was later upgraded to a state-of-the-art Ferrari Testarossa. Lt. Castillo was their uptight superior. Gina and Trudy were a pair of female undercover officers. Stan and Larry was Crockett and Tubbs' more traditional backups.\nSonny's co-workers changed during the years: his original partner in the pilot (played by Jimmy Smits) was killed, as were his backup Zito and his original superior Lt. Lou Rodriquez (played by Gregory Sierra). Even his original Ferrari was blown up accidentally at the beginning of the third season.\nThis stylish, MTV-influenced series was a smash hit, and transformed stuggling actor Don Johnson into a major sex symbol in the mid-80's. His expensive pastel sports jackets worn over a T-shirt, with a stubbly beard and no socks started a fashion trend for those into the rugged, macho look. Most of the female characters on the show swooned over him. Sonny's estranged wife, Caroline, and his young son were rarely seen, and later in the show, his new bride Caitlin Davies was an infrequent guest.\nA multipart story in 1988 had Sonny believing he was really his drug-dealing undercover alter ego, Sonny Burnett, forcing partner Tubbs (who was \"Rico Cooper\" undercover) to bail him out.\nThe show attracted many famous celebrities not normally seen in TV acting roles to do cameos, including singers from the 50's - 80's: James Brown, Ted Nugent, Phil Collins, Little Richard and the Fat Boys. Watergate felon G. Gordon Liddy made an impression in the role of sneaky Capt. Real Estate.

Originally, Brandon Tartikoff of NBC had an idea for “MTV cops” which he presented to Anthony Yerkovich who had been a writer and producer on Hill Street Blues. Yerkovich turned out the pilot and a few scripts and it was he who conceived of Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) and Ricardo Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas).\nYet most of what you associate with Miami Vice, what attracted you to Miami Vice, what dazzled you about Miami Vice is the visual stylings of Executive Producer Michael Mann. (Collateral, Heat, Insider) What he brought to Vice was a high production value more typical of movies than TV. Unlike any show before, Miami Vice had a “look.”\nMann saw the colors of Miami, the beautiful art deco buildings, the ocean and waterways and made an edict. No earth tones. This applied to the clothes the actors wore, the buildings which were repainted with pastels, the cars. Mann’s visual eye scanned everything in a scene looking for the dreaded reds, beiges and browns.\nHe watered the streets for night scenes so they would look slick and reflect the night lights and moon.\nThen there was the more obvious eye candy. The cars, the boats, (See Miami Vice Hardware Page ) the clothes, the chicks.\nMiami Vice was unique in the use of music. Using first tier artists such as Phil Collins, Glen Frey, Peter Gabriel and U2, the music added something dramatically beyond just background. The lyrics and tempo contributed to the storyline of the scene and often spoke for the characters. The pounding score by Jan Hammer was the first of many backgrounds he would do in a distinctive style. When he left after the 4th Season and was replaced by Tim Truman, many fans were disappointed.\nMann also saw the underbelly of Miami, the flamboyant drug dealers, the murders, and the pervasively corrupting influence of so much coke money. All of which Miami Vice took seriously. Vice had bad guys who were really, really bad and more than a few good guys gone bad.\nDon Johnson. You cannot discuss Miami Vice without talking about Don Johnson. (See Don Johnson pics just for fans.)\nThe actors were little known before Miami Vice but soon became megastars. Don Johnson blew across the American consciousness, changing everything in his path. Men began sporting three day stubble, espadrilles and loafers without socks, Ray Ban Wayfarer sunglasses, no belts, unconstructed Italian blazers over tee shirts, linen pants… And hey, as it turns out, pastels can be macho!\nAlthough the rest of the cast was capable, the only one who seemed to hold his own against the Johnson onslaught was Edward James Olmos as Lt. Martin Castillo, the unsmiling by-the-book head of the Metro Dade OCB. (Organized Crime Bureau)\nToday when you see that C.S.I. uses different visual styles for their shows (warms hues for Miami and bluish cool ones for New York) or when rock music is a component of many shows, all that is because Miami Vice came first. If we expect higher production values, it is because Mann said we would notice the difference and was right about that. Miami Vice is a landmark show no one can forget.\n \nThe Cars of Miami Vice\n \nClick for Larger View\nA good undercover cop needs the toys to maintain an appearance of affluence. Plus a speedy car and boat is handy no matter which side of the law you prefer. So Don Johnson’s character on Miami Vice was supplied fancy cars, clothes and boats by the Miami-Dade Police Department to protect his cover.\nIn the first two seasons, Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) drove a Ferrari Daytona Spyder 365 GTS/4. Midnight black. Sleek.\nWell, not really. It was a Corvette that had been modified with Ferrari-designed body panels and real Ferrari hardware inside.\nNow the good people at Ferrari were delighted by the brand getting so much attention, they just thought it would be SO much better if the car was actually a Ferrari. So they donated two of their very best, the Testarossa. (12 cylinders, 345 hp, 180 mph).\nOriginally, Ferrari North America delivered black cars but Michael Mann had them painted white for better contrast at night. The car in black can be seen in episode “When Irish Eyes Are Crying” (3.1) driven by an IRA gun. Later in the story, Sonny’s black Ferrari Spyder gets blown up by the bad guys. In the next episode “Stone’s War,” he receives his new white Testarossa. ( see pictures of the Testarossa in black .)\nThe use of the Testarossa in Miami Vice was such a boon to Ferrari sales, that Enzo Ferrari gifted Don Johnson with a 1989 silver version. That car was sold by Don Johnson at auction in 2003 for $88,560. Of interest, his 1970 Plymouth ‘Cuda’ Convertible from “Nash Bridges” sold at the same auction for $148,500.\nMore Cars\nRicardo Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) drove a 1962 Cadillac Coupe DeVille Convertible\nStan Switek (Michael Talbott) drove a turquoise 1963 Ford Thunderbird\nGina Calabrese (Sandra Santiago) drove an early 1970 Mercury Cougar XR-7 convertible\nA classic Miami Vice image. Miami shines at night with city lights and glowing neon. The Ferrari Spyder parked, while Sonny is on the phone asking his soon to be ex-wife, “Was it real?”\nThe Ferrari cruises the Miami mean streets at night.\nDon Johnson as Sonny Crockett reacts to his beloved Ferrari Spyder being blown all to hell by gun runners.\nJust another day in paradise!\nThe Ferrari Testarossa before it got a white paint job. As seen in episode “When Irish Eyes Are Crying.”\nThe Guns of Miami Vice\nIn the pilot episode, Don Johnson carried a Browning BDA in .45 Auto. But once the series was picked up, they needed a stylish and new weapon for Sonny Crockett. In seasons 1 & 2, he carried a Bren Ten in 10MM Auto. However the manufacturer, Dornaus & Dixon went bust. So the ever up-to-date Sonny switches to a Smith & Wesson 645 chambered in .45 Auto for seasons 3 and 4. But wait, by the fifth season Smith and Wesson has a new gun and the ever fashionable Crockett upgrades to the new Smith & Wesson 4506, also in .45 Auto. The piece he carried in an ankle holster was a .45 Detonics Combatmaster.\nAbout the shoulder holster. It had been made before Miami Vice, sold as the Original Jackass Rig. The Jackass Leather Company changed their name to Galco and then Miami Vice hit the air. The rig became so popular that it is now called the Miami Classic rig and can be bought from Galco’s website and other places.\nRico Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) had a Smith and Wesson Model 38 Chief’s Special and a Model 37 Ithaca Shotgun cut down.\nDon Johnson\nDon Johnson\nThe Boats of Miami Vice\nSonny Crockett (Don Johnson) lived on a 42′ Endeavor sailboat called the St. Vitus Dance. Except that the people in the neighboring slips thought he was Sonny Burnett, his undercover personna!\nBut it is the “go fast” boats we all remember best. In the first season, it was a 39′ Chris Craft Stinger. Actually, they used two Stingers, one for the pilot episode and then once the show was picked up a different boat for the entire 1st season.\nIn all the remaining seasons it was a 38′ Wellcraft Scarab KV, which was equipped with two powerful 8.2 Mercury engines, which offer a capacity of more than 840 HP. Wellcraft made a limited run of “Miami Vice” edition boats which had the same color scheme so the public could don a pastel tee and join in the fun.\nFrom the pilot, “Brother’s Keeper” the Chris Stinger and the Endeavor. In later years, the Scarab would be tied up to the sailboat.\nThe 42′ Endeavor sailboat that Sonny called home. Named the St. Vitus Dance\nThe Stinger used for the first season. For fans – can’t your just hear Russ Ballard’s “Voices” playing in the background?\nThe Chris Craft Stinger used in the first season.\n.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\n... awards and cast information for Miami Vice [TV Series] (1984) ... who lived on a sailboat called St. Vitus' Dance with his pet ... police-detective, drug-lord, ...

Set in (where else?) Miami, the series starred Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas as hard-nosed Miami-Dade PD vice detectives Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs. Crockett was a Ferrari-driving fashion trendsetter (how many millions of the series' young male fans emulated Sonny's no-socks, no-shave \"look\"?), who lived on a sailboat called St. Vitus' Dance with his pet gator, Elvis. Tubbs hailed from New York, and had come to Florida to track down the drug dealer responsible for his brother's murder. Like most such salt-and-pepper TV detective teams, Crockett and Tubbs did not always see eye to eye on details and procedure, but when they worked together as undercover cops in the sleazy underbelly of the Florida resort community, they almost invariably got results. And the criminal element -- which on this series consisting primarily of drug lords, white slavers, and illicit arms traders -- was well advised to stay out of their way. Though Sonny and Ricardo were pretty much the whole show, a few supporting characters were also worth noting, especially Edward James Olmos as the boys' mercurial superior officer Lt. Martin Castillo, Olivia Brown and Saundra Santiago as feisty female cops Trudy Joplin and Gina Navarro, and John Diehl as Larry Zito, Crockett and Tubbs' obligatory \"orthodox\" co-worker Calabrese. Making occasional appearances were Belinda Montgomery as Sonny's ex-wife, Caroline, and Sheena Easton as wife number two (albeit briefly), Caitlin Davies. Except for a short 1988 story arc in which an amnesiac Sonny assumed his \"undercover\" identity as drug dealer Sonny Burnett, things moved at a steady and reliable clip throughout the series' four-season run.

From executive producer Michael Mann (Heat, Collateral) comes the first season of the explosive, groundbreaking detective show that redefined the word “cool.” Set against the seamy and steamy Miami underworld, Miami Vice allows you to ride shotgun with suave Vice cops Sonny Crockett (Golden Globe winner Don Johnson) and Rico Tubbs (Phillip Michael Thomas) as they battle a never-ending gallery of criminals, drug dealers, and lowlifes. Jan Hammer’s electrifying score features a soundtrack of rock legends, including Glenn Frey, Phil Collins, U2, and Peter Gabriel, and every episode crackles with excitement and stylish flair. Also stars Emmy® and Golden Globe® winner Edward James Olmos (Battlestar Galactica) and a powerhouse roster of guest stars, including Ving Rhames, Jimmy Smits, and Bruce Willis.
