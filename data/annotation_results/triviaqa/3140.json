The following section shows us the different values of notes, that is, how long each note lasts.\n4 beats: called a semibreve (whole note)\n3 beats: called a dotted minim (dotted half note)\n2 beats: called a minim (half note)\n1 beat: called a crotchet (quarter note)\nHalf a beat: called a quaver (eighth note)\n \nQuarter of a beat: called a semiquaver (sixteenth note)\n \nDid you get it? Now you're ready to read more notes.\n \nMusic is written on groups of five lines called staves.\n \nNotes are written on lines:\n \n \nKeyboard music uses two staves.\nOne is for the top half of the instrument. The symbol at the beginning of the line is called the treble clef, sometimes called the G clef. In piano music this calls for the use of right hand.\nThe other is for the bottom half of the instrument. The symbol at the beginning of the line is called the bass clef, sometimes called the F clef. Bass clef calls for the use of the left hand.\nThe two staves are joined by a bracket. Usually the notes on the upper stave are played with the right hand, and the notes on the lower stave are played with the left hand.\n\n"
