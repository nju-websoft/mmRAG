Thus a sacramental name became a sign and seal of an established covenant between God and the recipient of such a name. Two Bible characters bearing sacramental names are Abraham and Sarah, both of which signify the gracious purposes and promises of God.\nThe wife of the patriarch was originally known as Sarai, meaning “princely” or “a princess.” Elsdon C. Smith suggests it may signify “contentious” or “quarrelsome,” but was changed, not accidentally, or by the whim of the bearer, but by God Himself that it might be a sign of His purpose, into Sarah, implying the princess, a princess or princesses, the source of nations and kings. Sarah or “chieftainness,” the feminine of Sar, meaning a “captain” or “commander” is repeatedly used in this sense as a common noun as, for instance, by Isaiah who renders it “queen” ( Isaiah 49:23 ). It has been observed that among ancient Jews there was a sort of a cabalistic translation that “the Hebrew letter yod signifies the creative power of God in nature, while the letter hay symbolizes the state of grace—that state into which Sarah had entered after receiving the covenanted promises.” The promise of ancestorship of many nations came with the change of the name of Sarai to Sarah. “I will bless her and she shall become nations.” She was thus associated with her husband in the great blessing of the covenant whose name was also changed from Abram to Abraham. The former, original name means a “high, or honored father,” the latter, “a father of many nations.” The Apocrypha speaks of Abraham as “a great father of a multitude of nations” ( Ecclesiasticus 44:19-21 ).\nThe root idea of Sarah means “to rule,” and fits the personality of the bearer. It was a name intended as a seal of the promise given to Abraham, “kings of peoples shall be of her.” Paul has an allegorical reference to Sarah as one who typified the gospel dispensation, “Jerusalem which is above ... which is the mother of us all” ( Galatians 4:26 ). Thus, Sarah was to be the princess, not only “because she was to be the ancestress of a great nation literally, of many nations spiritually, but also because the rank and power were to be possessed by her descendants, or rather because the people descended from her were to be ruled over by a regal dynasty, by a succession of kings of their own race and lineage, is derived from her.” In the genealogy of the descendants of Esau, Sarah’s grandson we read, “These are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.” The line of kings descended from Sarah terminated in God’s Anointed One, the Messiah, whose “kingdom is not of this world.” The sacramental name of Sarah, therefore, also symbolizes the spiritual seed, the whole multitude of believers of all nations who are “kings and priests unto God.”\nThen the personal application of the changed name must not be forgotten. Called Sarah by God and the Angels ( Genesis 17:15; 18:9 ), she exhibited the traits of a princess, “wielding a sceptre by the magic of which she could lord it over men’s hearts after her own will, even bring kings to her feet. If she came into the world with a will of her own as her dowry, nature further assisted her in developing it by the great beauty of her face and the grace of her stature. By these gifts she made her wish a command and disarmed opposition.” Both in bearing and character she illustrated the significance of her name. Through the long, long years of the quiet and stedfast devotion of Abraham to Sarah, peace reigned in the matrimonial tent more because of Abraham’s gentleness, kindness and forbearance, even though he lived so long with the more expressive and possessive ways of Sarah. Twice over in the kjv of the New Testament she is referred to as Sara, but the asv uniformly gives us Sarah ( Hebrews 11:11; 1 Peter 3:6 ).\nFamily Connections—Sarah came from Ur of the Chaldees, Babylonia, and her former name Sarai, “princely,” identifies her as coming from an honored family. She was the daughter of Terah and was therefore half-sister to Abram, her senior by ten years ( Genesis 17:17 ), whom she married in the Ur of the Chaldees. While Abram and Sarai had the same father, they had different mothers ( Genesis 20:12 ). Marriages between near relatives were countenanced in those days and were sometimes common for religious reasons ( Genesis 24:3, 4; 28:1, 2 ), but not marriages between those actually by the same mother. Sarai was well past middle life and childless when with Abram she left her own country and with him went out “not knowing whither they went” ( Genesis 11:29, 30 ).\nThere are various ways of looking at this remarkable woman who through a long span of life was the faithful wife of a prophet known as “The Friend of God.”\nHer Uniqueness\nStrange though it may sound and seem, the first Jew was a Gentile, for Abraham who came from beyond the Euphrates was the first man to be called a Hebrew, “Abram the Hebrew” ( Genesis 14:13 ). The word Hebrew itself means, “the immigrant,” and was no doubt the usual designation among the Canaanites. As his wife, Sarah was the first Hebrewess—the joint fountainhead of the great Jewish race ( Genesis 11:29-31; Isaiah 51:2 ). Abraham has been fitly called, “The fountainhead of the Hebrew hero life,” and Sarah is the heroine of such life. She remains the first unquestionably historical woman of the Hebrews, and their first mother. She is, therefore, one of the most important female figures in the world’s history, as the natural source of the Jewish people, through whom the nations of the earth were to be blessed. Only two women are named in the illustrious roll of those conspicuous for their faith: Sarah is the first, and Rahab the second ( Hebrews 11:11, 31 ), both of whom lived by faith and died in faith ( Hebrews 11:13 ). Sarah or Sara have always been popular female names both among Jews and Gentiles.\nHer Beauty\nThe testimony of the Bible is that Sarah was unusually beautiful ( Genesis 12:11, 14 ). The lines of Keats were true of her—\nA thing of beauty is a joy for ever:\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\nPass into nothingness; but still will keep\nA bower quiet for us, and a sleep\nFull of sweet dreams ...\nHebrew folklore has kept alive stories of her remarkable beauty and ranks her next to the most perfect woman the world has known, Eve, “the mother of all living.” Sarah seems to have had beauty that grew more attractive with the passing years. “Of the things that are unfavourable to the preservation of beauty, the Orientals count travel as one that is most baneful, even fatal to it,” says Gustav Gottheil. “Yet when Sarah arrived, after a long journey through dusty deserts and under a scorching sun, at the frontiers of Egypt, she was more beautiful than ever, and this explains the curious speech of Abraham to his wife at that juncture: ‘Now I know that thou art a woman beautiful to look at.’ Did he not know that before? Not so convincingly, explains the rabbi, as after he had seen that even travel had left no touch on her countenance.”\nIsaiah says that, “Beauty is a fading flower” ( Isaiah 28:1 ), and a song of old has the stanza—\nBeauty is but skin deep,\nAnd ugly to the bone.\nBeauty soon fades away,\nBut ugly holds its own.\nBut with Sarah it was different, for even when she was 90 years of age she was so lovely that Abraham feared that kings would fall in love with her bewitching beauty—which Pharaoh and Abimelech did, as our next glimpse of her proves. As one of the most beautful women who ever lived we can imagine that wherever she journeyed the admiring eyes of all were cast upon her. “Grave is all beauty,” and Sarah’s renowned loveliness certainly brought its trouble.\nHer Peril\nWhen famine drove Abraham and Sarah into the land of Egypt, and they felt that hostile kings might take them prisoners, Abraham came up with the abject, base proposal that if taken prisoners then his wife should represent herself as his sister. Fear of death unmanned him and led him to risk the dishonor of his wife and thereby save his own neck. She dearly loved her husband, and his life was too precious to her to make her think of the shame she might incur. Sarah was utterly wrong in yielding to her husband’s plot. How nobler she would have been had she stoutly refused Abraham saying, “How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?” But she called her husband “lord,” and evidently he was lord of her conscience.\nAbraham felt that if oriental despots knew that Sarah and he were married they would slay him and add the lovely woman to their harem. Married to a conspicuous beauty caused Abraham to be afraid, and he resorted to a falsehood to save his life. If taken, Sarah was not to say that she was his wife but his sister. This pretense was not an outright lie, but a half-truth, seeing that she was his half-sister. They were children of the same father, but not the same mother. It seems hard to believe that such a good man could deliver his lovely wife over to a heathen monarch, but he did, and Sarah entered Pharaoh’s harem. But God protected her by sending plagues upon the monarch. Pharaoh sent her back to her own husband, untouched. The same unworthy plan was carried out when Abimelech, king of the Philistines, admiring her bewitching beauty had her taken to his harem. But again God interfered and commanded the king to restore Sarah to Abraham, seeing she was his wife. Threatened with violent death, Abimelech obeyed, but severely rebuked Abraham for his deceit ( Genesis 12:10-20; 20 ). Years later Isaac, the son of Abraham and Sarah, used this same form of deception ( Genesis 26:6-13 , see href=\"/id/42314245-4242-3341-2D30-3838372D3345\">Rebekah ).\nGod expressed His displeasure with Abraham and his wife because of their ill-conceived plot. As the Righteous One, He could not condone such trickery. Had He not called them out from their country for a specific mission? And was He not able to protect and preserve them from harm and danger in a strange land? Was not the halflie told on two occasions an indication of the lack of faith in God’s overshadowing care and power to fulfill His promise? Abraham’s lofty soul suffered an eclipse of the virtue of faith for which he was renowned when he adopted such a plan of deception, exposing his wife to great peril, and also thwarting of the divine plan for and through Sarah. (Compare Hagar.) Abraham’s deception was followed by an attempt to ease an offense, and the patriarch was more blameworthy than Sarah who should have resisted the dangerous plan of exposing herself for the sexual gratification of other men.\nA lie that is half a truth\nIs ever the worst of lies.\nA half-truth is always a lie. While it was true that Sarah was Abraham’s sister, the assertion was in reality a falsehood. After the severe rebuke from Pharaoh for their deception, they should have learned their lesson, but to commit the same sin again a few years later, and further imperil God’s plan to make of them a great nation, leaves Abraham and Sarah without excuse. How slow we are to learn from our past failures?\nHer Sorrow\nThe one great grief of Abraham and Sarah was that through their long life together they had no children. To a Hebrew woman, barrenness was looked upon as a gnawing grief, and sometimes regarded as a sign of divine disfavor. Childless, even when back in Babylonia ( Genesis 11:30; 16:1-8 ), Sarah remained so until at 90 years of age God miraculously fulfilled His promise and made her the mother of the son of promise. Through the long years, “side by side with the prosperity, beat for beat with the pulse of Abraham’s joy, there throbs in Sarah’s heart a pulse of pain ... There is as yet no heir.” The constant grief of barrenness caused Sarah to become “The Woman Who Made a Great Mistake.” In spite of the fact that, along with her husband, she had received the divine promise, that from her nations would spring, the possibility of ever becoming a mother died in her heart. Such a cross as barrenness inflamed and intensified her pride, and forced her to find a way out of this embarrassment to her husband. “Sarah sacrificed herself on the cruelest altar on which any woman ever laid herself down; but the cords of the sacrifice were all the time the cords of a suicidal pride: till the sacrifice was both a great sin in the sight of God, a fatal injury to herself, to her husband, and to innocent generations yet unborn.”\nSarah revealed the sad defect of her qualities when she said to Abraham, “Take Hagar my maid, and let not the promises of God fail through me. Through her I can continue your hereditary line.” But all poor Hagar could do was to produce an Ishmael. It was only through Sarah that the promised seed could come. Although it might have been a custom of the time for a man with a barren wife to take a concubine in order that he might have an heir, Abraham, as a God-fearing man, should have stoutly refused to go along with the unworthy scheme, which in the end produced jealousy and tragedy. “Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai,” but the voice was the fatal siren of Satan who sought to destroy the royal, promised seed ( Genesis 3:15 ). As one modern writer expresses it—\nLittle did Sarai think when she persuaded Abram to take Hagar, that she was originating a rivalry which has run in the keenest animosity through the ages, and which oceans of blood have not quenched.\nIn our cameo of Hagar (which see) we sought to show all that followed the blunder of Sarah, when she intervened in God’s plan and chose her way to continue her husband’s posterity.\nHer Joy\nIn His forgiving love and mercy God appeared to Abram when he was 99 years old, and assured him that his long barren wife, although now 90 years old, would conceive. To confirm His promise God changed the name of Abram to Abraham, and of Sarai to Sarah ( Genesis 17; 18 ). At such a revelation of God’s purpose, “Abraham fell upon his face and laughed.” Although he marveled at the performance of the naturally impossible, Abraham yet believed, and his laughter was the joy of a man of faith. Laughter is sometimes mad ( Ecclesiastes 2:2 ) but that of Abraham was highly rational. He rejoiced in the thought that Isaac should be born, and perhaps at that time he had a vision of the Messiah. Jesus said, “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day” ( John 8:56 ). As for Sarah, what was her reaction when she overheard the Lord say to her husband, “Sarah thy wife shall have a son”?\nThe record says, “Sarah laughed within herself,” but hers was the laugh of doubt. Yet when her son was born he was named Isaac, which means “laughter”—a memorial of her sin ( Genesis 18:13 ), and of her husband’s joy ( 17:17 ). Sarah’s joy knew no bounds, “God hath made me to laugh” ( 21:6; 24:36 ). She had laughter before, but God was not the author of her laugh of doubt. The joy of Sarah in the birth of Isaac reminds us of “the great joy” proclaimed by the angels who made known to the shepherds the birth of Christ who came of the line of Isaac ( Luke 2:10; Romans 4:18-21 ). Paul reminds us that it was by faith that Sarah conceived beyond nature ( Hebrews 11:11 ). It was not only in itself a miracle wrought by faith, but also in earnest of something far greater, even the Incarnation of Jesus Christ.\nHer Longevity\nSarah is the only woman whose specific age is stated in Scripture. A girl’s approximate age is given us in the gospels. The only daughter of Jairus whom Jesus raised from the dead was “about 12 years of age” ( Luke 8:42 ). Sarah called herself old when she was 87 ( Genesis 18:12 ), but she was 127 years of age when she died. Abraham had reached the patriarchal age of 175 when God called him home. Godliness has always been favorable to longevity. The “good old age” ( Genesis 15:15 ) was a signal proof of the faithfulness of the Lord. When the Countess of Huntingdon came to die she said, “My work is done, and I have nothing to do but to go to my Father.” Surely the same contentment was experienced both by Sarah and Abraham who were not satiated with life, but satisfied with it. Abraham lived for another 38 years after Sarah’s death before his God-given task was completed.\nThe day came, then, for Sarah to leave the world in which she had sojourned so long, and hers is the first grave to be mentioned in Scripture. Although Abraham and Sarah were nomads living in their tent in a desert land, the aged patriarch wanted a more permanent resting place for his beloved wife than the shifting sand of the desert. Here vultures and beasts of prey would wait to gorge themselves off the dead, leaving behind nothing but white bones. Breaking with the ancient custom of the desert burial, Abraham purchased a cave at Machpelah as a sepulcher for his dear Sarah, and when Abraham himself came to die his sons “buried him beside Sarah.” Thus, in death, symbolically, they were unseparated as they had been through their long and eventful life together. When Cornelia, the mother of Caius and Tiberius Gracchus, whom she called her “jewels” died, on her monument was inscribed, “Cornelia, the mother of Gracchi.” Had a monument been erected for the noble woman we have been considering, the simple inscription in enduring marble would have been sufficient—\nHere lies\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n... 1 Peter 3:6), is the only woman whose age is mentioned in Scripture. ...

Genesis 23:1 Commentaries - Bible Hub Genesis 23:1 Commentaries: Now Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.\nMatthew Henry's Concise Commentary\n23:1-13 The longest life must shortly come to a close. Blessed be God that there is a world where sin, death, vanity, and vexation cannot enter. Blessed be his name, that even death cannot part believers from union with Christ. Those whom we most love, yea, even our own bodies, which we so care for, must soon become loathsome lumps of clays, and be buried out of sight. How loose then should we be to all earthly attachments and adornments! Let us seek rather that our souls be adorned with heavenly graces. Abraham rendered honour and respect to the princes of Heth, although of the ungodly Canaanites. The religion of the Bible enjoins to pay due respect to all in authority, without flattering their persons, or countenancing their crimes if they are unworthy characters. And the noble generosity of these Canaanites shames and condemns the closeness, selfishness, and ill-humour of many that call themselves Israelites. It was not in pride that Abraham refused the gift, because he scorned to be beholden to Ephron; but in justice and in prudence. Abraham was able to pay for the field, and therefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity. Honesty, as well as honour, forbids us to take advantage of our neighbour's liberality, and to impose, upon those who give freely.\nBarnes' Notes on the Bible\nSarah is the only woman whose age is recorded in Scripture. She meets with this distinction as the wife of Abraham and the mother of the promised seed. \"A hundred and twenty and seven years,\" and therefore thirty-seven years after the birth of her son. \"In Kiriatharba.\" Arba is called the father of Anak Joshua 15:13 ; Joshua 21:11 ; that is, of the Anakim or Bene Anak, a tall or gigantic tribe Numbers 13:22 ; 28; 33, who were subsequently dispossessed by Kaleb. The Anakim were probably Hittites. Abraham had been absent from Hebron, which is also called Mamre in this very chapter Genesis 23:17 , Genesis 23:19 , not far from forty years, though he appears to have still kept up a connection with it, and had at present a residence in it. During this interval the sway of Arba may have commenced. \"In the land of Kenaan,\" in contradistinction to Beer-sheba in the land of the Philistines, where we last left Abraham. \"Abraham went to mourn for Sarah,\" either from Beer-sheba or some out-field where he had cattle pasturing.\nCHAPTER 23\nGe 23:1, 2. Age and Death of Sarah.\n1. Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old, &c.—Sarah is the only woman in Scripture whose age, death, and burial are mentioned, probably to do honor to the venerable mother of the Hebrew people.Sarah’s age and death; Abraham mourns, Genesis 23:1 ,2. He speaks to the sons of Heth for a burying-place, Genesis 23:3 ,4. They offer him the choice of their sepulchres, Genesis 23:5 ,6. Abraham desires to purchase a field of Ephron, Genesis 23:8 ,9. Ephron would give it him, Genesis 23:10-15 . Abraham purchases it, and weighs the silver, Genesis 23:16 . The field made sure to Abraham for a possession before witnesses, Genesis 23:17-20 .\n1860\nThis is the peculiar honour of Sarah the mother of the faithful, 1 Peter 3:6 , to have the years of her life numbered in Scripture.\nGill's Exposition of the Entire Bible\nAnd Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old,.... This following immediately upon the account of the offering up of Isaac, led many of the Jewish writers to conclude, that Isaac was when thirty seven years of age, as he must be when Sarah his mother was one hundred and twenty seven, for he was born when she was ninety years of age; but this seems not to be observed on that account, but to give the sum of her age at her death, since it follows:\nthese were the years of the life of Sarah; who, as it is remarked by many interpreters, is the only woman the years of whose life are reckoned up in Scripture.\nAnd Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.\nEXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)\nPulpit Commentary\nVerse 1. - And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old (literally, and the lives of Sarah were an hundred and twenty and seven years); so that Isaac must have been thirty-seven, having been born in his mother's ninetieth year. Sarah, as the wife of Abraham and the mother of believers ( Isaiah 51:2 ; 1 Peter 3:6 ), is the only woman whose age is mentioned in Scripture. These were the years of the life of Sarah - an emphatic repetition designed to impress the Israelitish mind with the importance of remembering the age of their ancestress.\nKeil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament\nAfter Abraham had offered the ram, the angel of the Lord called to him a second time from heaven, and with a solemn oath renewed the former promises, as a reward for this proof of his obedience of faith (cf. Genesis 12:2-3 ). To confirm their unchangeableness, Jehovah swore by Himself (cf. Hebrews 6:13 .), a thing which never occurs again in His intercourse with the patriarchs; so that subsequently not only do we find repeated references to this oath ( Genesis 24:7 ; Genesis 26:3 ; Genesis 50:24 ; Exodus 13:5 , Exodus 13:11 ; Exodus 33:1 , etc.), but, as Luther observes, all that is said in Psalm 89:36 ; Psalm 132:11 ; Psalm 110:4 respecting the oath given to David, is founded upon this. Sicut enim promissio seminis Abrahae derivata est in semen Davidis, ita Scriptura S. jusjurandum Abrahae datum in personam Davidis transfert. For in the promise upon which these psalms are based nothing is said about an oath (cf. 2 Samuel 7 ; 1 Chronicles 17:1 ). The declaration on oath is still further confirmed by the addition of יהוה נאם \"edict (Ausspruch) of Jehovah,\" which, frequently as it occurs in the prophets, is met with in the Pentateuch only in Numbers 14:28 , and (without Jehovah) in the oracles of Balaam, Numbers 24:3 , Numbers 24:15-16 . As the promise was intensified in form, so was it also in substance. To express the innumerable multiplication of the seed in the strongest possible way, a comparison with the sand of the sea-shore is added to the previous simile of the stars. And this seed is also promised the possession of the gate of its enemies, i.e., the conquest of the enemy and the capture of his cities (cf. Genesis 24:60 ).\nThis glorious result of the test so victoriously stood by Abraham, not only sustains the historical character of the event itself, but shows in the clearest manner that the trial was necessary to the patriarch's life of faith, and of fundamental importance to his position in relation to the history of salvation. The question, whether the true God could demand a human sacrifice, was settled by the fact that God Himself prevented the completion of the sacrifice; and the difficulty, that at any rate God contradicted Himself, if He first of all demanded a sacrifice and then prevented it from being offered, is met by the significant interchange of the names of God, since God, who commanded Abraham to offer up Isaac, is called Ha-Elohim, whilst the actual completion of the sacrifice is prevented by \"the angel of Jehovah,\" who is identical with Jehovah Himself. The sacrifice of the heir, who had been both promised and bestowed, was demanded neither by Jehovah, the God of salvation or covenant God, who had given Abraham this only son as the heir of the promise, nor by Elohim, God as creator, who has the power to give life and take it away, but by He-Elohim, the true God, whom Abraham had acknowledged and adored as his personal God, and with whom he had entered into a personal relation. Coming from the true God whom Abraham served, the demand could have no other object than to purify and sanctify the feelings of the patriarch's heart towards his son and towards his God, in accordance with the great purpose of his call. It was designed to purify his love to the son of his body from all the dross of carnal self-love and natural selfishness which might still adhere to it, and so to transform it into love to God, from whom he had received him, that he should no longer love the beloved son as his flesh and blood, but simply and solely as a gift of grace, as belonging to his God-a trust committed to him, which he should be ready at any moment to give back to God. As he had left his country, kindred, and father's house at the call of God ( Genesis 12:1 ), so was he in his walk with God cheerfully to offer up even his only son, the object of all his longing, the hope of his life, the joy of his old age. And still more than this, not only did he possess and love in Isaac the heir of his possessions ( Genesis 15:2 ), but it was upon him that all the promises of God rested: in Isaac should his seed be called ( Genesis 21:12 ). By the demand that he should sacrifice to God this only son of his wife Sarah, in whom his seed was to grow into a multitude of nations ( Genesis 17:4 , Genesis 17:6 , Genesis 17:16 ), the divine promise itself seemed to be cancelled, and the fulfilment not only of the desires of his heart, but also of the repeated promises of his God, to be frustrated. And by this demand his faith was to be perfected into unconditional trust in God, into the firm assurance that God could even raise him up from the dead. - But this trial was not only one of significance to Abraham, by perfecting him, through the conquest of flesh and blood, to be the father of the faithful, the progenitor of the Church of God; Isaac also was to be prepared and sanctified by it for his vocation in connection with the history of salvation. In permitting himself to be bound and laid upon the altar without resistance, he gave up his natural life to death, to rise to a new life through the grace of God. On the altar he was sanctified to God, dedicated as the first beginning of the holy Church of God, and thus \"the dedication of the first-born, which was afterwards enjoined in the law, was perfectly fulfilled in him.\" If therefore the divine command exhibits in the most impressive way the earnestness of the demand of God upon His people to sacrifice all to Him, not excepting the dearest of their possessions (cf. Matthew 10:37 , and Luke 14:26 ); the issue of the trial teaches that the true God does not demand a literal human sacrifice from His worshippers, but the spiritual sacrifice of an unconditional denial of the natural life, even to submission to death itself. By the sacrifice of a ram as a burnt-offering in the place of his son, under divine direction, not only was animal sacrifice substituted for human, and sanctioned as an acceptable symbol of spiritual self-sacrifice, but the offering of human sacrifices by the heathen was condemned and rejected as an ungodly ἐθελοθρησεία. And this was done by Jehovah, the God of salvation, who prevented the outward completion of the sacrifice. By this the event acquires prophetic importance for the Church of the Lord, to which the place of sacrifice points with peculiar clearness, viz., Mount Moriah, upon which under the legal economy all the typical sacrifices were offered to Jehovah; upon which also, in the fulness of time, God the Father gave up His only-begotten Son as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, that by this one true sacrifice the shadows of the typical sacrifices might be rendered both real and true. If therefore the appointment of Moriah as the scene of the sacrifice of Isaac, and the offering of a ram in his stead, were primarily only typical in relation to the significance and intent of the Old Testament institution of sacrifice; this type already pointed to the antitype to appear in the future, when the eternal love of the heavenly Father would perform what it had demanded of Abraham; that is to say, when God would not spare His only Son, but give Him up to the real death, which Isaac suffered only in spirit, that we also might die with Christ spiritually, and rise with Him to everlasting life ( Romans 8:32 ; Romans 6:5 , etc.).\nLinks\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nSarah is the only woman mentioned as laughing in the Bible ... all whose knees have ...

He was converted a short time   later (Acts 8:34-39).\nIn (Acts 19:23-41), it speaks about a great riot that occurred in   Ephesus. Apparently, it started slow, but \"soon the whole city was in an   uproar\" (Acts 19:29).

God basically offered this to Solomon, and Solomon asked for \"an understanding heart to judge thy people.\" This pleased God and Solomon was given more wisdom   than any man in history (1 Kin 3:5-14).\nIsn't it interesting that Pharaoh ordered every newborn Israelite boy to   be drowned in the Nile (Ex 1:22), then many years later   Pharaoh's Egyptian army was drowned when the Red Sea swept over them (Ex   14:26-28)?\nWhen the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, they did so at night, with a \"pillar of cloud\" providing light for them to see (Ex 14:19-22).\nGod brought the plague of locusts upon Egypt, and also parted the Red Sea   with a strong east wind (Ex 10:13)(Ex 14:21).\nThe first time the word \"love\" is used in the Bible is when Isaac spoke   about loving food (Gen 27:4).\nThe Psalms mention the heart 122 times.\nJairus' daughter was 12 years old when Jesus brought her back to life (Lk   8:41-42,49-56).\nYou know that scene we often see where Joseph and the pregnant Mary are   going to Bethlehem, and Joseph is walking while leading a donkey on which   Mary is riding?

They are compared to prostitutes (Deut 23:18), greedy men (Isa   56:10), and evil men (Phil 3:2)(Rev 22:15). Did you know that in Bible times, dogs were despised?\nWhen Jesus told Nicodemus that we must be born again (Jn 3:1-3), it was   at night.\nMary, the mother of Jesus, speaks in 15 verses in the Bible (193 words -   KJV).

The hyssop plant was also   used when giving Jesus a drink while He was on the cross (Jn 19:29).\nHave you ever felt like you are the only person left who is standing for   the truth? There is a term for this: \"An Elijah Complex.\" Elijah felt this   way and God told him, \"...

It wasn't actually an olive branch, but   an olive leaf (Gen 8:11).\nI always thought that leprosy in the Bible must have been very contagious   since it appeared to be everywhere, but research tells us that about 95% of   all humans are naturally immune to it when exposed.\nMost of us know that Eden was the first city mentioned in the Bible (Gen   2:10).

About 150 years after that, it was destroyed forever in 612   B.C..\nBased on (Gen 5:21-22), it appears that Enoch may not have believed in   God for the first 65 years of his life, until after his son Methuselah was   born.\nIt appears that Methuselah, who lived longer than anyone in history (969   years: Gen 5:27), died in the year of the flood (maybe in the flood?)(add up   the numbers of Gen 5:26-28 & Gen 7:6). Interestingly, he outlived his son,   Lamech who died 5 years prior to the flood at age 595 (see: Gen 5:28,30 & 7:6).\nDemas, Paul's friend and fellow worker in Christ (Col 4:14)(Phile 1:24),   abandoned him right before he was martyred, having \"loved this present world.\" He left for   Thessalonica (2 Tim 4:10).\nAaron was 3 years older than his brother Moses (Ex 7:7).\nIt was Aaron, not Moses, who threw down his rod before Pharaoh and it   turned into a snake (Ex 7:8-12).\nIt appears that Moses and Aaron died in the same year.

(see: Heb   11:37)\nUnder Roman law, a Roman citizen could not be flogged or crucified. Paul   was a Roman citizen, so he could not legally be flogged (Acts 16:37-38)(Acts   22:24-29).

However,   when the Bible uses \"but,\" it is often in a positive way. See: (Gen   50:20)(Mt 6:33) (Ps 73:26)(Rom 5:8)(Rom 6:23). (Several studies have been   written on this called \"Great But's In The Bible.\")\n2nd Kings 19 and Isaiah 37 are almost identical.\nThe sign above Jesus on the cross was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin   (Lk 23:38)(Jn 19:20).\nJoseph wept 7 times (Gen 42:24)(Gen 43:30)(Gen 45:2,14-15)(Gen  46:29)(Gen 50:1,17).\nThe time period between Jesus' resurrection and ascension was 40 days   (Acts 1:3).\nPaul uses the word \"grace\" within the first 5 verses of each book he   wrote.\nPaul also gives \"thanks\" in the 1st chapter of 11 of his 13 books.\nJudah gave his first son (Er) to marry Tamar. God killed him for being   wicked. Then Judah gave his second son (Onan) to marry Tamar. God killed him   too for being wicked. Judah would not give his third son to marry Tamar, but   later unknowingly had sex with her, thinking she was a prostitute. She bore   him twins. (Gen 38:6-26).\nGod miraculously caused the sun to stand still in the sky, providing   light for 24 hours straight  (Josh 10:12-14).\nAs a sign to Hezekiah, God caused the sun's shadow on a sundial to go   back ten degrees (Isa 38:7-8).\nIn response to King Belshazzar's contempt for the holy things of God, God   sent a \"hand\" which wrote a message on the wall. The King was terrified.   Daniel told him the message said he would die. He was killed that night. (Daniel 5)\n(I always get a picture of \"Thing\" from the Addams family. Creepy!)\nMoses was not allowed into the Promised Land because he disobeyed God   (Num 20:2-13)(Deut 34:4), but many   scholars believe that when  he appeared with Jesus on the Mount Of   Transfiguration (Mt 17:1-9)(Mk 9:2-8), that the mountain was in the Promised   Land.\nAs far as I can find, there are 8 people in the Bible with 2 letter   names: Ir - (1 Chr 7:12), Og - (Num 21:33), On - (Num 16:1), So - (2 Kin 17:4), and four men named Uz   - (Gen 10:23)(Gen 22:21)(Gen 36:28)(1 Chr 1:17).\nThere are also 7 cities with 2 letter names: Ai - (2 cities named Ai)   (Gen 12:8) (Jer 49:3), Ar - (Num 21:15), No - (Ezek 30:15), On - (Gen 41:45,50), Ur - (Gen   11:28,31), Uz - (Job 1:1).\nIn (Ps 72:6) it mentions grass that has been mowed.\nThe well called \"Jacob's Well\" (Jn 4:6), where Jesus spoke to the   Samaritan woman (Jn 4:1-26) was, according to tradition, built by Jacob   centuries earlier (possibly after he bought that land in Gen 33:18-19). That   well can still be seen today in the Palestinian village of Tell Balata!\nIn (2 Sam 12:1-14), the prophet Nathan confronted David about his sin of   adultery with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband by telling him a   parable. After hearing the parable, David became angry and said the man in   it should die, and make restitution \"fourfold.\" It turned out David was the   man in the parable, and the \"fourfold\" restitution he \"prophesied\" about   himself sadly came true. For the one man he had killed (Bathsheba's   husband), he later had 4 sons die: (2 Sam 12:15-19)(2 Sam 13:28-33)(2 Sam 18:14-15)(1 Kin 2:23-25).\nJesus used \"fish\" to perform a miracle 4 times in His earthly ministry:\n1.

Six Amazing Moms in the Bible - CBN.com Six Amazing Moms in the Bible\nSix Amazing Moms in the Bible\nBy Anita Renfroe\nCBN.com  If  you have spent your adult life trying to live up to  the mothering standard set in the thirty-first chapter of Proverbs (and I know  some women do), you might as well just go ahead and take up permanent residence  in the I-can’t-quite-measure-up lane. I have a sneaking suspicion that that  woman was either a composite sketch of several stellar women, a wishful hope,  or a case of one woman mistakenly believing her own press kit.\nThe intro to that chapter  of Proverbs states that these are “the sayings of King Lemuel — an oracle that  his mother taught him.” Webster defines this sort of oracle as “a person giving  wise or authoritative decisions or opinions.” I would amend that to say that  this was likely a mother hoping none of the girls her son was currently dating  would ever measure up to her “oracle.” Regardless, we are left with the  impression that this sort of mother is the Approved Standard Version — family  centered, good business woman, great cook, generous, prepared, discreet,  praiseworthy, wise, and beautiful. If she was indeed a real woman — all things  to all people                  and extraordinarily perfect — then I’m just glad we  didn’t have a                  chance to meet. She could  never have considered me as part of her                  Potential Friend Pool.\nThis is precisely why I am  so glad that the Bible gives us                  pictures of other kinds of mothers — the ones who  cause us to                  nod our head to affirm the phrase, “If you can’t be a  good example                  then you’ll just have to be a horrible warning.” I  have come up                  with examples of a few of  both types in the following list. There                  are many other moms in  God’s Word, but these are a sampling of                  the good, the bad, and the  downright bizarre.\nMOMS IN THE BIBLE\nEVE\nThe Original Mother — more specifically, of Cain, Abel,                  and Seth (and several  unnamed others)\nI guess if we are to  commence in chronological order we would                  have to begin with Eve, the mother of us all. And she  was the woman                  who made THE monumental, mind-blowing,  affects-everybody                 forever mistake. So she probably deserves the bad rap  she gets. But                  it wasn’t like there were any other women around to  make it instead                  of her, right? Maybe she was the first to partake of  the fruit just                  because she was the only one who could remember where  it was                  in the garden (women just know where stuff is). You  have to feel a                  little bit of sympathy for the girl who didn’t have a  mother to ask                  about how things were for her back in the day. When  the kids had                  a temperature or were teething she just had to figure  it out on her                  own, but, then again,  nobody could look at her and tell her that she                  was doing it all wrong.  And sure, she got us into epidurals, but she                  had the mother of all  heartache, too. Her sons were involved in the                                    first homicide (without  Nintendo and violence on TV to blame it on). She was the first mom to have to  bury her child.\nSARAH\nMother of Isaac\nThis is the mom who gives  hope to everyone who waited a little late to get started on the Mommy Track.  Not that she didn’t try; her womb was just on a different biological clock. God  made a promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations. This led  Sarah to the logical conclusion that she would be the mother of many nations.  When that wasn’t happening in a timely manner, Sarah decided to do her own \"thang,\" so to speak. She gave her handmaiden Hagar as her maternal stunt double.  This resulted in a child but not the child. When the messenger of  the Lord told Abraham that it really would be Sarah that was going to deliver  the promised baby, Sarah overheard, laughed, and promptly got in trouble for  it. But if you were her age you would laugh, too, just thinking about how the  breast-feeding would be easy now that she could just lay Isaac on her lap to do  it. Sarah is a sister who could laugh at her late start with motherhood knowing  that good things come to those who wait.\nREBEKAH\nMother of Jacob and Esau\nFor every mom who has ever  had the temptation to play favorites with her children, pay attention to  Rebekah. She didn’t just play favorites, she schemed and connived and was an  accessory to one of the biggest Daddy Dupes in all of history. It says it plain  in Scripture that Isaac loved Esau because he was an outdoors-man but Rebekah  loved Jacob. This kind of favoritism does not bode well for a family. When the  lines are drawn and it is obvious who is thick with whom, life can get very  messy. Rebekah was in collusion with Jacob (even his name meant “trickster”) to  take the birthright from his older brother. I’m sure she rationalized that it  wasn’t such a bad thing since the twin boys were only separated by moments, but  her hand in helping Jacob trick his father was her way of thumbing her nose at  the order of things and a diss to her dying husband. Turns out that this family  rift lasted for a long time. Rebekah reminds us that it is a dangerous thing to  use maternal power for manipulation.\nBATHSHEBA\nMother of  Solomon\nBathsheba was well-named  as it was her “bath-ing” that                  attracted the attention of  King David. Their illicit affair resulted in                  the birth of a son. David  tried for some damage control by sending                  her husband out to war,  back to the house hoping for a copulating cover-up, and then out  to the frontlines to get killed. (And we                  think we have seriously  evil plots in our current movies.) David got                  his wish — Bathsheba’s  husband was killed in battle, and David                  thought he had gotten away  with it. Nathan confronted him and                  David repented bitterly.  But we never really hear how it all affected                  Bathsheba. Their sin is  well documented and the effects to David’s                  household long-lasting.  However, a son was born from their union                  and Solomon turned out to  be a peaceable ruler whose wisdom                  was legendary. Bathsheba’s  motherhood gives women hope that,                  regardless of the  circumstances surrounding your pregnancy and                  the birth of your child,  God can redeem any situation. You never                                    know, you might just have  the wisest person ever on the planet staring back at you from that high chair.\nJOCHEBED\nMother of Aaron, Moses, and Miriam\nIf there was ever a mom  whose life would have made a great screenplay for a Lifetime for Women movie it  would be Jochebed. You just have to give it up for her and the midwives who, in  their act of civil disobedience, allowed Moses to be born. Those midwives, when  asked by the pharaoh why they were not killing the boy babies as commanded,  replied that the Hebrew women were “too vigorous” and popped those babies out  before they could get there! Thus baby Moses was born but had to be sent down  the river (literally) with his sister serving as lookout, only to be pulled out  of the water by the pharaoh’s daughter, who secured the services of Moses’ biological mom to nanny him. Talk about movie script material! Oh wait. They’ve  already done that. Anyway, Moses’ mom shows us that the determination and  ingenuity of a desperate mother can result in surprising circumstances. Oh, the  places you’ll go!\nMARY\nMother of Jesus\nTalk about your Personal  EPT . . . I mean Mary’s was early, EARLY! And accurate, too. Angelic visitation  definitely qualifies as a sure thing. But the favored girl had to have some  concerns because unwed pregnancy was a little different back then. You could  get stoned for it. I’m sure she was very relieved to find out that the angel  had given her beau, Joseph, the same message. And yes, she was going to give  birth to the divine Gift of heaven, but, as any                  mother knows, all gifts come with some work attached.  She still had to change the Baby Jesus’ diapers, soothe him as  he teethed,                  teach him to walk, and clean up his skinned knees. She  had to cook                  the meals and wash his clothes and do all the things  that moms do                  for their children. It’s interesting the places we see  Mary pop up in                  the gospels — for example, at the temple sending out an  APB for                  her boy. (I believe I might have grounded Jesus if he  told me that he                  was just doing his father’s business, but no such  reaction from Mary                  is recorded.) Another of my favorite mother moments of  Mary’s                  was when she was at the wedding feast apparently exasperated  with                  her thirty-year-old son for not doing that “thing” he  could do with                  the water. When Jesus seems to refuse to come through  the way she                  knows he can, she goes around him and tells the  servants to get ready                  to do something for him. And Jesus does the miracle. I  would have                  loved to have been there to see the looks pass between  mother and                  son that night. And then we see Mary at the  crucifixion. Disciples                  may scatter, followers may be in hiding, but a mother  stays when                  the rest of the world walks away. In fact, Mary is a  rich tapestry of                  real motherhood: a lot of  excitement followed by years of work and                  moments of intense pain.  But through it all, mothers are there.\nThese moms in the Bible  reveal to us that mother-love is fierce                  and stubborn to a fault — even wrong-headed sometimes.  We do                  right things for wrong reasons and wrong things  because we think                  everyone needs our help. When you look at the moms in  the Bible                  say a silent prayer of  thanks that these women are included along                 side the Oracle of Lemuel  in Proverbs 31 to bring snapshots of                  reality and spiritual  caution cones to our journey.\n\n"
