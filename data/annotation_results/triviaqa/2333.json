BBC SPORT | Football | Gerrard named player of the year BBC SPORT | Football | Gerrard named player of the year\nGerrard named player of the year\nIt is the first time Gerrard has won the prestigous award\nLiverpool captain Steven Gerrard has claimed the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award.\nIt is the first time the 25-year-old has been named player of the year by his peers, although he was Young Player of the Year in 2001.\nGerrard, who a day earlier helped Liverpool win their FA Cup semi-final, said: \"I am still in shock.\n\"To go through to another FA Cup final and win this special award in the same weekend is fantastic for me.\"\nWayne Rooney, the 20-year-old Manchester United striker, won the PFA Young Player of the Year award for the second successive season.\nPFA PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n1996: Les Ferdinand (Newcastle)\n2000: Roy Keane (Man Utd)\n2001: Teddy Sheringham (Man Utd)\n2002: Ruud van Nistelrooy (Man Utd)\n2003: Thierry Henry (Arsenal)\n2005: John Terry (Chelsea)\n2006: Steven Gerrard (Liverpool)\nRooney had been a contender for the senior player of the year prize - along with Gerrard, Arsenal striker Thierry Henry and the Chelsea trio Joe Cole, Frank Lampard and John Terry, who won last year.\nGerrard was third in last season's vote but then went on to guide the Reds to Champions League victory against AC Milan in Istanbul.\nPlayers receive two votes and Gerrard revealed that he had voted for Henry and England team-mate Rooney.\nManchester United star Rooney said he was pleased to again pick up the young player prize.\n\"To win it twice on the run is a great honour and I am delighted with the award,\" Rooney said.\nHe beat off competition from Charlton striker Darren Bent, team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo, Tottenham's Aaron Lennon, Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas and West Ham defender Anton Ferdinand.\nRooney added: \"I voted for Fabregas, but it was close between him and Darren Bent.\"\nPFA YOUNG PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n1996: Robbie Fowler (Liverpool)\n2005: Wayne Rooney (Manchester Utd)\n2006: Wayne Rooney (Manchester Utd)\nIt was no surprise that champions Chelsea had the most players named in the Premiership Team of the Year in the shape of John Terry, William Gallas, Joe Cole and Frank Lampard.\nNewcastle's Shay Given was picked in goal while Wigan full-back Pascal Chimbonda was also included after a solid season for Paul Jewell's side.\nBut Wigan star Chimbonda fears it has come too late to land him a place in France's World Cup squad.\nHe said: \"I have not given up hope. The window is still open, but the manager tends to look at the bigger players at the bigger clubs.\n\"Maybe he did not think Wigan would do as well as they have, so in that respect it will hardly be a surprise if I don't make it.\n\"But it's such a big honour. To make it into the PFA team means it has been a fantastic season, with a lot of pleasure derived from the fact the team have stayed up.\n\"To do so well has been a massive surprise. I was expecting a battle against relegation, so the way the season has gone, it has been far beyond my expectations.\"\nPlayer of the Year:\nYoung Player of the Year:\nWayne Rooney (Manchester United)\nPremiership Team of the Year:\nShay Given (Newcastle), Pascal Chimbonda (Wigan), John Terry (Chelsea), Jamie Carragher (Liverpool), William Gallas (Chelsea), Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Joe Cole (Chelsea), Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United), Thierry Henry (Arsenal), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United).\nChampionship Team of the Year:\nMarcus Hahnemann (Reading), Gary Kelly (Leeds), Ibrahima Sonko (Reading), Joleon Lescott (Wolves), Nicky Shorey (Reading), Steve Sidwell (Reading), Ashley Young (Watford), Phil Jagielka (Sheffield United), Jason Koumas (Cardiff), Marlon King (Watford), Kevin Doyle (Reading)\nLeague One Team of the Year:\nDarryl Flahavan (Southend), Greg Halford (Colchester), Sam Sodje (Brentford), Adam Barrett (Southend), Gareth Roberts (Tranmere), Neil Danns (Colchester), Andy Robinson (Swansea), Kevin Maher (Southend) Michael McIndoe (Doncaster), Lee Trundle (Swansea), Billy Sharp (Scunthorpe).\nLeague Two Team of the Year:\nJoe Hart (Shrewsbury), Danny Senda (Wycombe), Roger Johnson (Wycombe), Gareth McAuley (Lincoln), Matthew Lockwood (Leyton Orient), Kevin Betsy (Wycombe), Joshua Low (Northampton), Mark Jones (Wrexham), Ian Taylor (Northampton), Karl Hawley (Carlisle), Michael Reddy (Grimsby).\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nCristiano Ronaldo: What's the Right ...

Cristiano Ronaldo: What's the Right Decision? | Bleacher Report\nCristiano Ronaldo: What's the Right Decision?\nUse your ← → (arrow) keys to browse more stories\n3.2K\n4\nComments\nCristiano Ronaldo is most likely the best player in the world. The Winger of the recent Manchester United double winning team. The man who scored 42 goals in one season for the Red Devils (31 of those in the premiership).\nThis man could now break the all time transfer record, with rumors of Real Madrid wanting to offer up £80Million for the Portuguese Ace.\nManchester United is rather reluctant to let go of their prize asset, no matter what the Spanish giants are willing to offer. Whereas the man himself seems to have his heart set on moving to the sunny land of Spain.\nSome papers have said that Ronaldo has stated he made up his mind and that he was going to leave Manchester before their Champions League final win.\nAlex Ferguson decided to take this to FIFA, after their interest was made clear by Real Madrid, obviously showing his frustration of his best player wishing to leave, and not giving up the fight and letting him go.\nAs wise a man as Alex Ferguson is, I find it quite strange how much he wishes to keep Cristiano. I'm sure he knows better than most coaches in the world once a player is unsettled and wants to leave there is no stopping him. And that surely no player in the world is worth £80,000,000?\nAlex Ferguson has even come out and said that if Ronaldo wants to leave, he has no worries about leaving him to rot in the reserves. Quite a drastic statement don't you think from such a man of his status?\nI remember when Thierry Henry first expressed his wish to leave England for a far more glamorous destination, just like Ronaldo's wished get away, Spain. Alex Ferguson was the first to come out and back Wenger to let him go, saying that it would not hurt the Gunners title challenge anymore than if any other member of his squad were to leave.\nArsene followed this advice (not necessarily from Ferguson but maybe his own reasons) and the Gunners found themselves playing better and not missing the man that filled that 14 shirt so well.\nMaybe it comes to a point when you have a player of such caliber on your side, that you rely on them too much, and your overall game revolves around this one player.\nI would give this advice straight back to Ferguson, that overall Manchester United will not miss the presence or goals of Ronaldo, especially when you have £80 Million in your pocket after his departure.\nCristiano Ronaldo added six assists this year towards the Red Devils’ title success, and when you think of a wingers primary quality it would be their delivery to the strikers and their services towards the forwards goals.\nRuud Van Nistelroy's goals seriously decreased when Beckham left along with the great services he provided him, and then came along Ronaldo, who isn't and out and out play-maker for his attackers.\nIf you had someone for United to put the delivery in as Beckham did for Rooney and Tevez, Ronaldo would really not be missed at all. And let me note once again, especially when you have up to £80 Million to find his replacement.\nIn fairness to the Portuguese maestro, the far more exotic land of Spain compared to England seems a good move, where here we have cold summers and an even harsher winter (in relation to Spain). It seems most people would be tempted by such offers. Especially when they are willing to offer you the sum of wages that real Madrid can offer their players.\nSurely this move to Madrid seems too good to pass up?\nAlso the other things pointing the way to Spain for Cristiano are his achievements that he has already succeeded in.\nHe has won the Premiership twice, the F.A Cup, the Carling Cup, the F.A Community Shield and the Champions League. That is every cup you can win in England being a player for one of the top four.\nHe has also won the PFA players' player of the year award in 2007 and 2008, the PFA young player of the year award in 2007, PFA fans player of the year in 2007 and 2008 and has been in the PFA Premier League Team of the year in 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008.\nAs well as being the only player since Andy Gray in 1977 to win both the PFA players' player of the year award and the PFA young player of the year award in the same year.\nSo when you look at those facts, is there anything else left for Cristiano to succeed in in the Premiership? I think it's about time he moved on to conquer Spain.\nAnd if Ferguson is as good as a manager as I believe he definitely is, I expect/hope he will be saying adios to Mr. Ronaldo. And claiming a cool £80 Million to replace who really is a striker with a real winger.\n\n"
