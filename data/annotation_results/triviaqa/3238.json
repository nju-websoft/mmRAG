Establishment of a republic headed by two magistrates (later called consuls) elected annually.\nThe Roman Kings\nHistorical details are still too obscure for any definite records of Rome under the kings, All remains half mythical.\nBut it was under the Roman Kings that the Roman ability to create an empire of sorts first came to the fore, even though any original intentions will hardly have been of an imperial nature.\nIn all there was said to have been seven kings of Rome covering a period of over two hundred years.\nRomulus\nThe first recognized king of Rome was its mythical founder, Romulus.\nTo him is attributed the foundation of the senate.\nHe is also said to have ruthlessly pursued a policy of expanding the population, granting refuge and acceptance to criminals on the run at the asylum on the Capitoline Hill. He expanded the city�s boundaries to encompass four hills; Capitoline, Aventine, Caelian and Quirinal.\nIf Romulus� reign was infamous, this impression is only further reinforced with an episode widely known as the �Rape of the Sabine women�.\nWith Rome�s populace enlarged with runaway slaves and criminals, king Romulus found himself ruling a nation with too few women. The story goes that he staged extravagant celebrations for the festival of Consus (the god of the granary and the storehouse), inviting the neighbouring tribes to attend.\nFor large image click on picture\nItalian warrior of the late 8th, early 7th century BC\nMuseo della Civilta, Rome\nMany of the neighbouring Sabines were invited. But in mid-celebration the festival was brought to a sudden end, when Romulus and his Romans revealed their true intentions, taking possession of the unmarried Sabine women by force and claiming them as brides. Romulus himself came by his wife Hersilia by this very method.\nThe Sabine town of Cures, ruled by king Titus Tatius, quite understandably declared war.\nIn the resulting fight the Sabines managed to capture the Capitoline Hill, due to the treachery of Tarpeia who opened a gate (and who gave name to the Tarpeian Rock on the Capitoline). Further legend has it that it was the Sabine women who intervened to stop the fighting between their Sabine relatives and their new found Roman husbands.\nA peace was agreed and the Sabines of Cures and the Romans united and henceforth became one people. The two kings thereafter ruled jointly, Titus Tatius from the Capitoline and Romulus from the Palatine. Once the Sabine king died, sole rule fell to Romulus until his death at the age of 54.\nIf all this sounds very much like a string of fairy tales and legends, there are hints to underlying truths. For example, Quirinus was the Sabine equivalent of the Roman god Mars and we found his name reflected in the Quirinal Hill. So too in the rarely used alternative name the Romans would use for themselves, the quirites.\nNaturally Romulus death is also wrapped up in legend. While he was performing a ritual sacrifice to the gods at the river a thunderstorm struck. The people ran for cover from the rain, leaving Romulus and the senators behind. When they returned Romulus had vanished. If the official version suggested he had been swept up to the heavens by his father Mars in a chariot, this sounded just a little too far fetched, even to the Romans. Especially as in his later life Romulus was said to have grown unpopular. So it was indeed suspected that the senators had ceased him and stabbed the tyrant to death.\nGiven later Roman history the legend of Romulus proved indeed ominously prophetic.\nNuma Pompilius\nNuma Pompilius came to power following the controversy surrounding the death of Romulus.\nImmediately after Romulus� death the leading senator Julius Proculus then claimed that Romulus had appeared to him in a vision and was now the god Quirinus. This elegantly absolved the senators of any suspected wrongdoing and cleared the way for Julius Proculus to become the next king, no doubt with Romulus� supposed blessing.\nThe Roman people, however, were not willing to accept this seamless transition to one of their king�s possible murderers. Clearly it was not going to be the wily Julius Proculus.\nInstead the Sabines in Rome demanded that, since the death of Titus Tatius had seen them ruled by a Roman without complaint, it was now for one of their number to become ruler. The Romans agreed, as long as it would be for them to choose who among the Sabines should be king.\nThe choice fell upon Numa Pompilius, a man who apparently didn�t even want the job. Unlike Romulus, Numa was not a warrior king, but a religious, cultural figure.\nTraditionally, Numa is seen as the man who moved the order of the Vestal Virgins from Alba Longa to Rome, founded the temple of Janus, established the various priestly colleges, including the order of the fetiales who held the power to declare war and make peace. In order to allow for all the religious rites to be performed at the appropriate time, Numa is said to have reformed the calendar, adding the months January and February and bringing the days to a total of 360 for each year.\nDuring the 43 years of Numa�s reign Rome enjoyed uninterrupted peace.\nMuch of his wisdom was said to be due to his receiving divine guidance from the gods.\nHe was said to have received their advice from the nymph and prophetess Egeria who became his lover after the death of his wife.\nTo the Romans King Numa Pompilius was the father of their culture; the man who turned the semi-barbarian peasants, criminals and bride-robbers of Romulus into something resembling a civilization.\nModern historians are not sure what to make of this figure. Some priesthoods he is said to have created are believed to predate his reign. Meanwhile his supposed reform of the calendar was possibly the achievement of a later generation.\nNonetheless, the high esteem in which the Romans held this figure, suggests that he was of great significance in the creation of their identity as a people.\nFor large image click on picture\nItalian warrior of the late 8th, early 7th century BC\nMuseo della Civilta, Rome\nTullus Hostilius\nWith the death of the peaceable Numa Pompilius rule next fell to the warlike Tullus Hostilius.  In these primitive days of early Roman history many of the disputes arose from mundane issues such as cattle rustling along territorial borders.\nNuma Pompilius had been a diplomatic man who would seek to achieve reconciliation. However, his successor Tullus Hostilius was a man who would seek to solve problems by the sword.\nWhen another such dispute arose between Rome and its neighbour Alba Longa, Tullus Hostilius declared war. Given the very close ties between the two cities, this was a virtual civil war. Therefore, in order to avoid slaughter between armies related to each other, the two leaders Tullus Hostilius and Mettius Fufetius agreed instead on a contest of champions. Three brothers from each side would fight in place of the armies.\nFor the Romans the brothers Horatius took the field and for the Albans the brothers Curiatius. The fight ended with all Curiatii dead and only one of the Horatians alive.\nThe Roman victory meant that Alba Longa conceded defeat and swore allegiance to Rome.\nKing Mettius however had no intention of accepting Roman supremacy and succeeded in provoking another Roman neighour, the Fidenates, into war.\nWhen the Romans met the Fidenates in battle their supposed Alban allies abandoned them. Mettius Fufenius� though proved plans were in vain. Rome defeated the Fidenates on her own. The Albans were soon crushed, their leader torn apart by two chariots and the city of Alba Longa was destroyed. The Albans were thereafter moved to Rome where they were given the Caelian Hill to settle on.\nThis increase in population made the senate�s meeting place too small to contain the enlarged senate. Tullus Hostilius therefore decided a new senate house was needed. It was constructed at the western end of the Forum at the foot of the Capitoline Hill. It remained there throughout Roman history and continued to bear its builder�s name, the Curia Hostilia.\nTullus Hostilius is said to have thereafter campaigned successfully against the neighbouring Sabine tribes, until a plague befell him as well as the people of Rome, forcing them to make peace.\nIn seeking to avert the wrath of the gods, Hostilius now sought to emulate his predecessor and took greater interest in his religious duties.\nYet his new found religious devotion fell well short of having the desired effect. King Tullus Hostilius was struck lighting and died.\nAs with other kings of Rome we are not sure if Tullus Hostilius ever existed at all. The family of the Hostilii did however appear in the records some one or two centuries later. So it is well possible that their half-mythical ancestor existed.\nAs the destroyer of Alba Longa it may indeed have been Hostilius, not Numa Pompilius, who brought the religious orders, including the Vestal Virgins, to Rome. Either way, the fall of Alba Longa and Rome�s assumption of all her religious festivals greatly increased the victorious city�s prestige throughout the region.\nAncus Marcius\nRome�s fourth king was Numa Pompilius�grandson and therefore another Sabine. Ancus Marcius was chosen as a ruler to restore the peace and quite the Romans had enjoyed under the rule of his grandfather.\nThis in turn gave Rome�s neighbours the impression that the city�s new leader was a pushover, eager for peace at any price and therefore unlikely to retaliate.\nThe first to test this premise were the so-called Old Latins (prisci latini), an ancient tribe who even predated Aeneas.\nYet king Ancus Marcius, perhaps to everyone�s surprise, proved to be as much of a warrior as he was an administrator, priest and diplomat.\nThe prisci latini were defeated, their city destroyed and their people absorbed into Rome.\nAncus Marcius is also said to have settled the Aventine Hill. Given this new influx of people, this may indeed\nTradition has it that Ancus Marcius founded the city of Ostia. Archaeology appears to say otherwise, suggesting the founding of Ostia to be of a later era.\nRome�s interest in the mouth of the river Tiber will most likely have been due to the presence of salt-pan. Occupying the later site of Ostia granted Rome control over the pans on the southern bank of the river Tiber. Those to the north remained in Etruscan hands.\nBuilding the first bridge over the Tiber, the wooden Sublician Bridge, Ancus established a bridgehead to the Janiculan Hill, which he fortified, though most likely did not as part of the city. This may well have been to help protect the salt route from Ostia and to deny the growing threat of Etruscans the strategic strongpoint on the western side of the river.\nAncus Marcius died widely respected and was deemed a truly good king by later Roman historians.\nAs with Tullus Hostilius, King Ancus Marcius does have much later descendants make an entrance into the Roman records. By 357 BC the Marcii reached the consulship.\nAgain this suggests the existence of this ruler of Rome�s semi-mythical history may indeed have existed.\nTarquinius Priscus\nTarquin the Elder\nThe fifth king of Rome was one Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (Priscus in this case simply signifies him as Tarquin �the Elder� and it was a title attributed to him much later by Roman historians). The stories surrounding this monarch show us that we are still deeply reliant on legend and myth to paint any sort of picture of his rule. Tarquin the Elder, as Tarquinius is generally called, moved to Rome from the Etruscan town of Tarquinii. His father, Demaratus, was a nobleman from Corinth who was forced to leave his city (655 BC) when the tyrant Cypselus assumed power there.\nThe link to Greece is indeed possible as there is evidence of Greek traders in Tarquinii. But it nonetheless sounds like a somewhat strained effort by later Romans to avoid admitting that Rome had in fact been ruled by Etruscans.\nLegend has it that on his entering the city of Rome an eagle swooped down and snatched Tarquin�s cap with his talons, only to place on his head again before flying away. Evidently Tarquin was a man favoured by fate.\nNontheless he deemed it wise to change his forename from the Etruscan Lucumo to the Latin Lucius in order to smooth his transition from Etruscan to Roman nobility. Tarquin�s wife Tanaquil was of aristocratic Etruscan blood.\nIf by his own right, or by that of his wife�s connections, Tarquin soon rose to be a figure of significant influence in Rome.\nHe further assumed an influential position with the reigning king, Ancus Marcius. So much so in fact, he was made guardian of King Ancus� two sons.\nThis proved a position of vital importance when Ancus Marcius died. Tarquin persuaded the two sons to go hunting while he made arrangements for their father�s funeral ceremony. When they returned it was to find Tarquin on the throne. He�d used their absence to win over the Romans to grant him their votes. The Roman monarchy was not hereditary. Ancus Marcius� sons had been in a prime position to win the favour of the Roman people, but Tarquin had outmanoeuvered them.\nTarquin�s means of accession to the throne may have been underhand, but his record as monarch seems to have been impressive.\nFirst he was to see off the military challenges by neighbouring tribes which seemed always to flare up at the accession of anew monarch.\nThough in battle Tarquin seems to have achieved much more than merely holding his ground. Tarquin�s many campaigns led to victories over the Sabines, Latins and Etruscans. According to Dionysius, it was a deputation of Etruscan cities defeated in battle which brought him the symbols of sovereignty: A gold crown, an ivory chain, an eagle headed scepter, a purple tunic and robe and twelve fasces (axes enclosed in bundles of rods).\nTarquin the Elder may have begun the construction of the great Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, but this is uncertain. The introduction of the Circus Games to Rome is ascribed King Tarquin the Elder. He is traditionally believed to have been the ruler who laid out the Circus Maximus.  Tarquin is also credited with the initial drainage of the forum and the creation of the Cloaca Maxima. Though it must be added that what was eventually to become the main sewer of Rome, was at this early stage merely a large drainage ditch to make usable the marshy ground in the shallow between the hills of Rome. Later further drainage was added by his successors.\nHe also added 100 members of the lesser nobility (minores gentes) to the senate. These were most likely lesser Etruscan nobles whom he�d encouraged to settled in the city. Their promotion will no doubt have helped to strengthen his grip on power.\nTarquin�s end, when it came, was a violent one. The scorned sons of King Ancus finally sought revenge and hired two assassins. As one approached from the front posing as a party in a legal dispute, the other came up behind and struck at his head with an axe. Tarquin died instantly. Yet that was not what the Romans were told. Tarquin�s wife Tanaquil informed the people that she was tending to his wounds and that the king meanwhile wished to see the little known Servius Tullius, a prot�g� of Tanaquil�s and Tarquin's son-in-law, act on his behalf until he had recovered.\nNaturally Tarquin the Elder never recovered. But by the time the Romans became aware of their king�s demise, the new man was already firmly on the throne.\nServius Tullius\nThe sixth king, Servius Tullius, was a monarch celebrated for particularly high achievement by the Romans. Yet to modern eyes, it appears as though several achievements of early Roman history have somehow been attributed to him as a means of attributing them to someone. For it seems doubtful that Servius was really responsible for all ascribed to him.\nServius Tullius� origins are uncertain. His name may in fact be a corruption of the word servus (slave). The name itself was later only used by plebeians.\nOne story tells of him being the son of a household slave. (Though Livy writes he was a prince from the Sabine city of Corniculum held captive by the Romans.)\nInterestingly, there was also an Etruscan tradition, which claimed that Servius was in fact an Etruscan named Mastarna.\nLegend also states that, when Servius was still a boy, his parents discovered him asleep in bed with his head covered by flames. Yet the sleeping child suffered no harm. Word of this momentous portent eventually reached Tanaquil, the wife of King Tarquin the Elder, who deemed it a sign that the boy was marked out for great things. Thenceforth Servius was a prot�g� of Rome�s powerful queen.\nAt the death of King Tarquin the Elder it was Tanaquil who assured Servius� ascent to the throne. The sons of Ancus Marcius being implicated in Tarquin�s murder made it impossible for them to now contest the throne. They retired into exile.\nTarquin the Elder however had three sons; Tarquin, Lucius and Arruns. To win their support, Servius shrewdly married them to his own daughters.\nHis position though was soon secured, when a war against the Etruscan city of Veii proved him to be an able military commander. In fact so impressive was his victory that in his 44 years in power he had no need to take to the field again.\nThe Romans believed Servius� reign to have seen the first use of coinage in the city.\nUnlike the Greeks, early Roman society did not use money. Far more they bartered - salt for pottery, grain for wood, etc...\nWhere the system proved inadequate the Romans expressed value in for of 'heads of cattle'. One such head of cattle was worth ten sheep.\nThe head of cattle (pecus) became the first Roman monetary unit. From this came the first Latin word for money - pecunia. A primitive monetary system evolved based on ingots of raw copper of the Roman pound (libra) of 327 g.\nSuch an ingot could then be broken up into yet different sizes and values.\nKing Servius was the first to have a stamp put onto the copper, until then it was just the raw metal. The design to have been used supposedly was either an ox or sheep.\nKing Servius Tullius is said to have enlarged the city. Romans also attributed the �Servian Wall� to him, though it is most likely that he was this city wall was a product of the 4th century BC.\nIt is widely believed though that the agger, a set of defensive earthworks on the Quirinal, Viminal and Esquiline Hills were a legacy of his. It is therefore possible that, although not the Servian Wall, some lesser defensive cordon may have been set up around the city by King Servius Tullius. After all, archaic Rome is believed to have possessed defences, albeit that we know very little about them. A major achievement of his reign appears to have been the transfer of the regional festival of Diana from Aricia to the Aventine Hill of Rome. A temple was dedicated to the goddess on the Aventine Hill, not merely by the Romans but by the people of Latium.  Archaeology seems to grant this story some support. The moving of a regional festival and the prestigious Temple of Diana to Rome seems to show that the city was of rising importance to the wider region.\nPerhaps the most impressive idea ascribed to Servius Tullius is the census, which counted the people and ranked them in five classes, according to wealth.\n(This division of the people by wealth is often referred to as a �timocratic� system, after the Greek timo (worth) and kratia (rule); so literally �rule by worth�.)\nThe classes were divisions created to decide the voting rights of the people (with the rich enjoying most votes) and to help administer the levying of troops, as the higher a citizen�s class, the better armour and weaponry he was able to afford.\nServius is further said to have made the division of the people into three tribes for tax purposes: the ramnes, the luceres and the tities. (Hence the relation of the words �tribe� and �tribute�.) These tribal divisions may have been ethnic in nature, though very little is known about them.\nA further change of constitutional importance credited to Servius Tullius is his reform of the army, in particular his granting the army a political assembly in its own right, the comitia centuriata.\nHis reign is also closely associated with the construction of the great Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus (185 ft wide and 65 ft high). If it is believed that Tarquin the Elder begun the temple, most of its construction must have been completed under Servius Tullius. Especially bearing in mind the length of Servius� reign, it is perhaps doubtful that Tarquin the Proud was the king to complete this great work, as tradition holds.\nLegend tells of an outrageous coup that overthrew King Servius Tullius in old age. It was the ambitions of Servius� daughter Tullia and her husband Lucius Tarquin which should prove disastrous to the old king.\nServius Tullius� policies had made him unpopular with the senators and Lucius Tarquin was quick to exploit that. If the tale of the king�s slave origins is true, this also will not have helped.\nAt some point a conspiracy was hatched to overthrow the king.\nFor large image click on picture\nModel of the archaic Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus\nMuseo della Civilta, Rome\nOne day Tarquin simply arrived at the senate in royal robes and summoned the senators to acknowledge him in his position. Servius rushed to the senate, but was bodily thrown from the hall. In the chaos that followed King Servius was stabbed to death by hired assassins.  Roman legend adds a gruesome note, describing how Tullia later returned from the senate, where she had seen her husband confirmed as the new ruler. When her carriage drove down the street in which her father Servius had fallen it ran across his dead body.\nThe street in which King Servius Tullius was assassinated and run over was henceforth known as the vicus sceleratus, the �street of guilt�.\nLucius Tarquinius Superbus\nTarquin the Proud\nThe seventh and final king of Rome was one Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (Superbus in this case simply signifies him as Tarquin �the Proud� and it was a title attributed to him much later by Roman historians).\nTradition holds that Tarquin �the Proud� was the son of Tarquin �the Elder�, though logic suggests that he more likely was a grandson. (Tarquin the Elder died in old age, his successor, Servius Tullius ruled for 44 years and Tarquin himself ruled for another 24/25 years.)\nHaving come to power by means of a violent conspiracy, Tarquin the Proud lacked any kind of legitimacy. He therefore governed Rome by much the same methods than those he�d used to win the throne. Tarquin was a tyrant similar to those which had seized power in many other Hellenistic kingdoms. His only means of sustaining his position were violence and oppression.\nHe pronounced himself the supreme judge of Rome, granting himself complete authority over capital cases without the accused having any recourse of appeal.\nThis privilege Tarquin now exploited to rid himself of any potential rivals. More so, the possessions of the convicted were then seized by the monarch.\nOne of the victims of these seizures was the father of one Lucius Iunius Brutus, the very man who should come to eventually overthrow him.\nIf Tarquin governed Rome as a petty, sometimes vindictive tyrant, his performance as a military commander and diplomat was more impressive.\nHe harassed and cajoled the Latin League into accepting Rome as its official head (the so-called �Treaty of Ferentia�), thereby tying the Latins into the Roman military machine, effectively doubling Rome�s military power in a single stroke.\nThis new military power was then put to use against the neighbouring tribe of the Volcians. Two cities were conquered; one by storm, the other, the city of Gabii, by deceit.\nThe spoils of this successful campaign were put to use in public works. Roman tradition ascribes the completion of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus to Tarquin �the Proud�, although today it is widely believed to have been completed by Servius Tullius.\nBut Tarquin is further thought to have continued the process of draining the forum, built and improved roads and strengthened the city�s defences.\nSuch public construction was, however, also the product of Tarquin�s oppression. Much of the labour was forcibly obtained from the plebeians.\nA legend of considerable importance which attached itself to Tarquin was that of the Sibylline Books.  The story goes that the famous Sibyl, a mythical prophetess known throughout the Hellenistic world, appeared before King Tarquin and offered him nine books, containing great wisdom. The price she demanded was astronomical. Tarquin declined. Unflustered, the Sibyl then threw three of the book sin the fire, only to demand the same price for the remaining six books. Unnerved, Tarquin though again declined only to see another three of the books tossed into the flames. Once more the Sibyl demanded the price. Tarquin relented, if only to save what knowledge was left.\nIf the Sibyl was legend, the Sibylline Books are indeed thought to have existed, though their origin is unknown. The books were repeatedly consulted for divine guidance in the republican era during times of crisis and were eventually destroyed when fire consumed the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus in 83 BC.\nWith the wealthy living in fear of prosecution, should Tarquin deem them a threat or take a fancy to their possessions, and the poor being used to labour in public construction, all Rome have been seething with resentment towards her ruler.\nWhen finally revolution occurred, Tarquin was not in the city, but engaged in another military campaign.\nThe final straw had been the rape of the noblewoman Lucretia by Tarquin�s son Sextus set the city alight. The nobles made their move, led by Lucius Iunius Brutus, declared themselves against Tarquin and instead announced Rome to be a republic (510/509 BC).\nThe army quickly came over to the rebels and Tarquin the Proud was forced into exile.\nThe early days of the Roman republic saw a bitter struggle for independence against Tarquin�s attempts to regain his throne. Nonetheless Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the tyrant of Rome, would never achieve control again. The Roman monarchy had fallen.\nEpilogue\nIt goes without saying that we have to take much of the history of the Roman kings with a pinch of salt. Much of this is mere myth and legend, though it evidently contains kernels of truth.\nSome of the myths, may indeed be of considerable significance to the very nature of Rome and its future achievement.\nThe very seed that created the Roman mentality which was to create the republic may indeed have lain in that heartfelt belief that they were a breed of refugees, criminals and runaway slaves who sought shelter at the asylum on the Capitoline Hill under king Romulus. Such an identity may have fostered the communal feeling of equality which we find reflected again and again in Roman history. Rome was divided by wealth and privilege, yet she believed in the essential equality of men. Albeit that some later claimed nobility or divine descent, the Romans were not pretentious about their origins. The ambiguities surrounding the she-wolf who suckled Romulus and Remus, the refuge on the Capitoline Hill and the legend regarding the �Rape of the Sabine Women� demonstrate that very aptly.\nBelieving themselves at least spiritual descendents of the uprooted, the fleeing and criminals in search of a second chance, it is perhaps not surprising that they should form a society which should eventually rid itself of its king and forge ahead with a government by the people for the people.\nAs with so much of Roman history changes to the constitution tended to be gradual. We find aspects republican constitution emerged under the kings.\nNot least the fact that monarchy was never deemed to be hereditary in Rome most have had a important part to play in the development of republican ideals.\nFar more the king was elected by the people, formerly appointed by the senate, an advisory body of patricians.\nHowever, the Roman monarch's rule was a total one. He possessed the right of capital punishment, was responsibility for foreign relations and war, for public security, public works, justice and proper maintenance of religion.\nThe very symbol of this total power were the fasces; the rods to scourge and the axe with which to behead the condemned.\nBut this royal power was tempered by the principle of consultation with the senate. This was the tradition that Tarquin the Proud ignored to his peril. Early Rome would simply not bear the arbitrary use of power by a tyrant.\nNonetheless it remains questionable how much longer a monarchy could have lasted were Tarquin to have been a wise and benign ruler. Most likely its time was up. Rome had evolved. Rome�s growing power and influence meant that her elite were growing richer and more powerful. The total rule of one could simply no longer be sustained with the patricians demanding a role for themselves in the running of affairs.\nIn all this we should perhaps also not underestimate the influence of the Greeks. Greek traders living in Rome may have introduced democratic ideas which the Romans, ever pragmatic, shaped into something of their own.\nPerhaps the very notion of Rome�s growth to a substantial town of rising regional power and prestige meant that it became subject to the influence of �dangerous foreign ideas�, such as democracy. These would weaken the monarchy, sapping its support from the nobles and the people alike.  So with a egalitarian spirit at the heart of Roman mentality, an ever more confident and ambitious elite seeking to have a share of power and Greek ideas undermining its standing among the people, the Roman monarchy may indeed have been doomed at the end of the sixth century. Rome�s future was to be a republic.\n-\nFor the next chapter please select �The Early Republic�\nThis page was last updated on 7th April 2012.\nAuthor:    F.

The Seven Kings of Rome - myromeapartment.com The Seven Kings of Rome\nThe Seven Kings of Rome\nRomulus\nRomulus was the legendary eponymous founder and first king of Rome (conventional dates: 753-717/16 B.C.). The story of the twins Romulus suckled by a she-wolf, established at Rome by the third century B.C. may be native, although Greek motifs heavily influenced its development. To Romulus were attributed Rome’s early political and military institutions, and victories over  neighbouring  people including the Caeninenses, whose king he slew in single combat. His seizure of Sabine woman as wives for his men resulted  in conflict and then co-rule with Titus Tatius. He was sometimes identified with the god Quirinus.\nNuma Pompilius\nNuma, from Cures, was the second king of Rome (conventional dates: 715-673 B.C.). The name may be authentic but his portrait is a (priestly) stereotype. Though his establishment of priesthoods, cults, and rituals he represents the scrupulous (and simple) observance of public religious obligations. Stories accumulated of his debt to Pythagoras (fiercely contested on chronological grounds) liaison with the nymph Egeria, and various miracles. Alleged writings by Numa were “discovered” in 181 B.C.: they were promptly suppressed.\nTullus Hostilius\nThe third king of Rome (conventional dates: 672-641B.C.), Tullus’ re-awakening of Rome’s military ambitions and institutions of associated rituals (including the fetial procedure) were probably suggested by his name (latin “hostis” means enemy): his campaigns, including the conquest of Alba Longa, reflect only later conceptions of Rome’s early expansion. He also reputedly constructed the senate house (Curia Hostilia) and neighbouring Comitium.\nAncus Marcius\nThe fourth king of Rome (conventional dates: 640-617 B.C.), Ancus Marcius remained a shadowy figure of whom virtually nothing was known. His later portrait is modelled partly on Numa whose religious rituals he reputedly revived. He is also attributed military successes against neighbouring states, the bridging of the Tiber, and fortification of the Janiculum. His supposed settlement at Ostia (to exploit the salt-beds) has not yet received archaeological confirmation.\nTarquinius Priscus, Lucius\nTarquinius Superbus, Lucius\nThe Tarquins were conventionally the fifth (616-579 B.C.) and seventh (534-510 B.C.) kings, but their reigns are so thoroughly confused that tradition evidently offered no reliable detailed information between them. That thr family (perhaps from Caere rather than Tarquinia) ruled twice is credible, but their chronology and the details of their accessions are unreliable. Wether either was dependent on outside support is unknown, although a Gnaeus Tarquinius from Rome was apparently involved with other Etruscan associates, in Vulcetatn Affairs.\nLater sources ascribed to one or both kings measures which (whoever their author) certainly reflect Rome’s development as a city-state under Etruscan influence in the sixth century B.C.: the drainage and organization of the Forum, the Circus and games, the (re-modelled triumph), the fasces and other insignia, The Capitoline temple, and Sibylline books. Both kings are also attributed a significant part in Rome’s external conquests, notably Superbus who establishes Roman hegemony in Latium. Priscus’ portrayal is largely favourable but Superbus supposedly his son or grandson, has acquired the characteristics of a Greek tyrant, to justify his expulsion by L. Junius Brutus.\nServius Tullius\nServius Tullius was the sixth king of Rome (conventional dates: 578-535 B.C.). Despite his suspect identification by the Emperor Claudius with Mastarna, an associate of Caeles Vibenna and Roman stories of his servile origins (derived from his praenomen), the rela basis and political tenor of his rule are purely conjectural. The tribal system and centuriate organization, ascribed to him, mat date from this period in a rudimentary form, reflecting, respectively, Rome’s urban development and adoption of hoplite tactics: His establishment of the Aventine shrine of Diana as a Latin cult centre would also mirror Rome’s growing importance, and archaeological finds support a sixth-century date for his temples of Fortuna and Mater Matuta (though is fortification wall is controversial).

The historical reality of these kings is challenged, and the central myths of their reign are explored.\nThe Kings of Rome\nWhen we think of Rome, we tend to think of the Roman Empire, a sprawling collection of nations and peoples ruled by a single emperor. Or we might think of the Roman Republic, with its separation of powers and system of checks and balances, ruled by vying aristocratic families. Yet in 753 BCE, Rome was just a new city-state, and like so many city-states of its time, Rome was ruled by a monarchy. This monarchy persisted for more than two centuries until the establishment of the republic in 510 BCE.\nUnfortunately, we don't have many details of this monarchy at our disposal. Rome's city records were destroyed during the sack of Rome in 390. Later generations of Romans pieced together a history of their early monarchy from legend and myth. The resulting account is rather short on detail and of questionable accuracy. Romans of the later republic were not big fans of kings and may have attempted to weave republican ideals into their history. As a result, we're not even sure if the kings they list even existed, let alone did the things the Roman historians claim. However, we can piece together a rough history of these legendary kings of Rome and at least see how the Roman monarchy eventually gave way to the novel Roman Republic.\nRoman Monarchy\nThe first king, Romulus, founded Rome\nAccording to Roman legend, the first king of Rome was Romulus, who founded the city and gave it its name. We're not sure if Romulus was a real person or just a figure of legend, but he certainly seems to have been a rather enlightened leader for his time. Romulus did not establish an absolute monarchy in which the king controlled every aspect of the state. Nor did he set up a dynastic monarchy in which princes succeeded their fathers to the throne. Instead, Romulus set up a sort of limited monarchy in which the power of the king is checked by other government bodies. He established a council of founding fathers known as the Senate . The Senate was mostly advisory in function. The only real power Romulus granted the Senate was the power to elect future kings. He probably got this idea from the Etruscans, who used a similar system to elect their own kings.\nThis still left a lot of authority in the hands of the king. In modern terms, the king was all three branches of government in one. He was the legislative branch, coming up with new laws. He was the executive branch, enforcing the laws of the state, managing state property and commanding the Roman army. He was the judicial branch, sitting in judgment of all civil and criminal cases. The king also served a religious function. He served as the intermediary between the gods and the people of Rome and had administrative control over the state's religion. So while it may be tempting to see a system of checks and balances in the relationship between the Senate and the king, the Senate, at first at least, only exercised real authority during the brief periods between the death of the last king and the election of a new one.\nThe Duly Elected Kings of Rome\nFollowing Romulus, Roman historians record the election of four more kings of Rome. They attributed the creation of many Roman traditions and sacraments to these duly elected kings. Though I shall list the dates of their reign, you should know that few historians take these dates very seriously.\nThe first was Numa Pompilius, who supposedly ruled from 715 BCE to 674 BCE. Numa is credited with:\nReforming the Roman calendar to include the months of January and February\nEstablishing the traditional Roman guild system\nRelocating the Vestal Virgins from Alba Longa to Rome\nIntroducing several Roman religious rituals\nUpon Numa's death, the Senate elected Tullus Hostilius, who reigned from 673 BCE to 642 BCE. Historians are pretty sure Tullus actually existed, but beyond that we know very little. The Romans gave him credit for\nConquering many of Rome's Latin neighbors, including the old Latin capital of Alba Longa\nBuilding the first Senate House, the Curia Hostilia\nNext came Ancus Marcius, who reigned from 641 BCE to 617 BCE. Marcius was the grandson of Numa, suggesting that though the Roman crown was not hereditary, certain families still tried to make it so. Marcius' contributions to Roman history are almost entirely on the field of battle. He conquered many neighboring Latin cities and relocated their residents to Rome, making them new Roman citizens. He also founded the Roman port city of Ostia.\nThe last duly elected king of Rome was Lucius Tarquinius Priscus\nThe last of the duly elected Roman kings was Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, AKA Tarquin the Elder, who ruled from 616 BCE to 579 BCE. According to our Roman sources, Lucius Tarquinius was not a Roman at all but rather an Etruscan nobleman who immigrated to Rome. The king at the time, Ancus Marius, was so impressed with Lucius that he appointed him the caretaker of his sons. Thus elevated, Lucius made a bid for the throne upon Marius' death and won the support of the Senate. The Romans considered Lucius Tarquinius one of their greatest kings. Abroad, he flexed his military muscles in campaigns against Latins, Sabines and Etruscans. At home, he added several important civic structures to Rome, including the Circus Maximus - the great Roman racetrack - and the Cloaca Maxima, Rome's impressive sewer system.\n×\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nThe Kingdom of Rome and the Seven Kings of Rome.

The last of these, Tarquin the Proud, was deposed in 510BC and so after 250 years of kingdom the Republican age of Rome followed. Each of these kings brought a different facet to the foundations of the future empire.\nThe Seven kings of Rome were: Romulus , Numa Pompilius , Tullus Hostilius , Ancus Martius , Tarquinius Priscus , Servius Tullius , Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin the Proud)\nThe choice of the first king after Romulus (753-715BC) was a difficult task but a Sabine, Numa Pompilius (715-673BC), was chosen to be the second king of Rome. Numa brought 43 years of peace which he used for the establishment of religious worship and cultivation. He created priestly and religious orders to Jupiter and Mars as well as other gods. He created a religious figurehead called the pontifex maximus and to this day that title is still used by the Pope. He had a temple to Janus built which would have its doors open only in times of war and it is to his credit that during his reign the temple doors were always closed. He also improved cultivation, dividing amongst his people the land Romulus had won and in order to enforce his citizen's respect for the boundaries he had laid out on the fields he also erected an altar to the god Terminus - god of boundaries - on the Capitoline hill.\nThe third king of Rome, Tullus Hostilius (673-642BC), had the temple of Janus doors flung open almost as soon as he took the throne: He employed his reign to teach his subjects the art of war. Looking for an enemy, he picked a dubious fight with Alba Longa. This was to be a moment of particular importance to the Roman people in ages to come: Realising that the fighting would weaken both the Albans and the Romans, making them easy prey to the Etruscans, the two sides agreed to decide the war through a single fight. Three brothers from either camp were chosen: the Horatians (Horatii) from Rome and the Curiatians (Curiatii) from Alba. Horatius of the Horatians was the last survivor and victor. Alba was eventually laid waste and its inhabitants transferred into Rome. Tullus successfully fought other wars but increasingly lost touch with his other duties such as worship of the gods. Popular history has it that Jupiter slew him and burned his house down with a flash of lightning.\nThe fourth king Ancus Martius (642-617BC) was a grandson of Numa. He left aside any wish to extend his dominions and instead busied himself with strengthening and beautifying the city. He had the rules for proper worship laid out on tablets and set out where everyone could read them. But he also concerned himself with defense of the city as well as prayer: he defended the Janiculum hill across the Tiber river, built a bridge across the river and colonised the river's mouth with a new settlement called Ostia. This opened Rome up to the sea and trading, allowing the city to take full advantage of her unique geographical position.\nTarquinius Priscus (616-579) was the fifth king of Rome. He was not a Roman Patrician (nobility) but rather an Etruscan come from the north to settle as a merchant in Rome. His rise to power stemmed from his great ability to form high society friendships, culminating in being named guardian of Ancus Martius' sons. When Ancus Martius died Tarquinius convinced the Senate into accepting him as King. He did well. He conquered the tribes round about and even the powerful Etruscans acknowledged him as their king sending him the symbols of power which were to remain engrained in Roman society henceforth. These symbols were: a crown, a sceptre and an ivory chair, an embroidered tunic, a purple toga and twelve bundles of rods called fasces in each of which was an axe. The fasces, carried by twelve men called the lictors, were symbol of his kingly power to judge and sentence to death. Tarquinius is thus also known for having strengthened the social class system following the Etruscan model. The Senate and Government were strengthened and distinctive ornaments and badges were introduced to distinguish officers from the common people.\nOnce he had subdued the enemies of Rome, Tarquinius set about improving the city. Not forgetting the lessons learned from his predecessors he built a splendid temple to Jupiter called the Capitol on the Capitoline hill. He also built an important sewer system called the cloaca maxima which was so efficient it served the city throughout history to come. Apart from its obvious use for refuse, this system of underground streams allowed him to drain the swamps between the hills. He is also known for having laid out the Circus Maximus, where public games were held.\nTarquinius was still guardian to the sons of Ancus Martius (the fourth king of Rome) but an omen convinced him to take particular care of the son of one of his slaves. The ground was laid for some trouble. Ancus' sons had Tarquinius assassinated but Servius was quick to seize power becoming the sixth king of Rome: Servius Tullius (579-535).\nServius Tullius never forgot his mother had been a slave and became such a friend of the poorer parts of society that he became known as good king Servius. Knowing that his people were made of many different social strata he had a census system put in place so that every five years every person would be counted up with their children and property.\nHe radically changed the military system: Until then the army was only composed of Patricians. Servius included all landowners, which he subdivided by the amount of land they owned. The largest landowners for example could afford a horse, armour and wheapons and would thus form the cavalry. Poorer classes could only afford smaller amounts of armour for themselves and would therefore be in the infantry as foot soldiers.\nTraining of the army would take place in an area of land called the Field of Mars or Campus Martius. The troops were divided into groups of one hundred men commanded by Centurions (centum means 100). The Campus Martius (Campo Marzo) is still an area of Rome today. Servius Tullius then had a defensive wall built around the city, parts of which are still visible today.\nThe end of his reign was rather tragic. His avaricious daughter, together with her husband Lucius Tarquinius a son of Tarquinius decided they wished the power for themselves. Right in the middle of the Forum, Lucius seized the aged Servius and flung him down the steps of the Senate and sent men to murder him. Servius' daughter having heard of the events went to salute her husband as king and had her chariot driven over her father's body.\nRome thus had its last king, Lucius Tarquinius or rather Tarquin the Proud (Tarquinius Superbus, 535-509BC) also of Etruscan descent. He was perhaps a greater lover of war than his predecessors and together with his three sons managed to subdue many tribes whether by force or trickery. He is noted for having purchased what was to be regarded as one of Rome's greatest treasures: the three Sibyline Books written by a seer know as the Sybil of Cumae. These books were prophecies about the future of the city and were consulted whenever the city was in danger.\nTarquin's harsh conduct and nature proved fatal for him and his Tyranny. He and his family were expelled from the city by his nephew. The city was now to become a Republic and it decreed that should anyone speak in favour of a return to kingly rule they should be put to death as an enemy of the state.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\n\"And There Are Seven Kings\" Who Are These Seven Kings? by Bob Pickle. Introduction; ... The papacy lost control of the seven hills of Rome in 1870 for the last time. Who Are These Seven Kings? - Pickle Publishing Who Are These Seven Kings?\n\"And There Are Seven Kings\"\nWho Are These Seven Kings?\nby Bob Pickle\nQuestions and Answers\nIntroduction\nIn Revelation 17, John sees a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored  beast. This beast has seven heads and ten horns. Who is the woman and what  are the heads?\nAnd the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.  (Rev. 17:18)\nAnd here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman  sitteth.  (Rev. 17:9)\nThe city that reigned over the kings of the earth for so long and  which sits on seven hills is unquestionably Rome. Somehow connected with  this scene are seven kings:\nAnd there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.  (Rev. 17:10)\nIt is these seven kings that we want to deal with in this paper. Basically, there are three different interpretations that could be  considered about who these seven kings are:\nSeven Individual Kings: This interpretation has a couple  variations. Some try to identify seven individual emperors (a typical  preterist view), and others  seven individual popes.\nSeven Kingdoms: This interpretation typically identifies the  first five kings either as being Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Pagan  Rome, and Papal Rome; or as being Egypt, Assyria, Babylon,  Medo-Persia, and Greece.\nSeven Forms of Roman Government: This interpretation  typically identifies the first five kings as being five of the  following forms of government: a) kings, b) consuls, c) dictators, d)  decemvirate, e) military tribunes with consular power, and f)  triumvirate.\nWhen Are Five Fallen?\nOne of the most important questions that needs to be answered is: When  is it true that five kings have fallen? Is this something that is true in  John's day or at the end of time?\nRevelation 17 is much like Daniel 11. While most of the prophecies of  these books are dreams and visions of pictorial scenes, these two chapters  are largely conversations between an angel and the prophet. \nWe do have another example on a smaller scale of this kind of thing in  Revelation 11:\nAnd I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall  prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.  . . .\nAnd when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. (Rev. 11:3, 7)\nNotice the future tenses. The one speaking to John places both the  preaching and the slaying of the two witnesses into the future. Thus the  time context of the conversation with John is prior to those events. And  yet:\nAnd after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.  (Rev. 11:11, 12)\nNotice the past tenses. Now John is describing what he actually saw in  the vision, not a conversation with some heavenly being. He describes  scenes he saw of the future as if they were already past.\nWhen John describes scenes of the future that he saw, he describes them  as being past. When John records a conversation explaining future events,  he describes those events as if they are yet future. We may safely  conclude that the time context of such a conversation is John's day. Thus,  when the angel speaks to John in Revelation 17 about the five kings being already fallen,  he is speaking of them already being fallen in John's day, not at the end of time.\nWe could have looked at other passages in Revelation to arrive at the  same conclusion, but it may be significant that we used Revelation 11, for  it is only in Revelation 11 and in Revelation 17 that we find an explicit  statement about a beast arising out of a bottomless pit.\nAnd when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. (Rev.  11:7)\nSo he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.  . . .\nThe beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit . . . .  (Rev. 17:3, 8)\nOne last thought on this matter:\nAnd the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.  (Rev. 17:3, 8, 12)\nJohn saw scenes of a beast and horns as if they already existed. After  this, he is told that the beast doesn't yet exist again, and that the horns have no  kingdom yet. So he saw them as if they already existed, but he is told  they don't exist yet. This would be true if the time context of the  angel's conversation was in John's day.\nSeveral Possibilities Ruled Out\nIf five kings were already fallen in John's day, we can narrow down the  possibilities for the identification of the seven kings. The idea that  they are seven popes is out, as well as the idea that they are seven  kingdoms beginning with Babylon. If they are indeed seven kingdoms, the  sequence would have to start with Egypt, for if we start the sequence with  Babylon, only the three kingdoms of Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece would  be fallen in John's day.\nIn considering the idea of the seven heads representing seven individual  emperors, those holding this view have differing opinions about which  seven are intended, depending on when it is believed that John wrote his  book. Here are three different lists that have been given: \nCaesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, and Galba.\nClaudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, and Titus.\nGalba,  Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, and Nerva.\nThe problem with the last  two lists is that there doesn't seem to be any logical reason to exclude  the emperors prior to Claudius and Galba. Why not include Augustus,  Tiberius, and Caligula? But that would then give us too many kings.\nThe first list necessitates that  John be exiled to Patmos during the reign of Nero, which seems  unlikely. Julius Caesar was never really an emperor. And what would be the point of ending with Galba? What would be the  point of the prophecy?\nThe Ten Kings\nDaniel 7:24 also speaks of ten horns representing ten kings, which  parallels Daniel 2's ten toes. Of those toes we are told:\nAnd in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.  (Dan. 2:44)\nThese ten kings arise out of the fourth kingdom in both Daniel 2 and 7.  (The four kingdoms are Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome.) When Rome  broke up in the fifth century, ten nations arose in western Europe, most  of which still exist today. What Daniel 2:44 is telling us is that these  kingdoms will still be around when Jesus returns at His second coming.  Clearly, the ten kings of Daniel 2 and 7 are still around at the end of  time.\nIf the ten horns of Revelation 17 are also ten kings at the end of  time, they must be the same ten kings as those in Daniel 2 and 7.  Otherwise we would have to have twenty kings, two sets of ten, at the end  of time.\nThe Seven Kings\nWhere should we look to find the seven kings? We'll glean some possible  answers by looking at Rome's seven hills and her history.\nThe seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman  sitteth. (Rev. 17:9)\nThe names of these seven hills are:\nAventine\nServius Tullius\nLucius Tarquinius Superbus\nTo this list we can add an eighth. Titus  Tatius ruled jointly with Romulus after the Sabines, of whom he was king, united with the Romans.\nThe history or legend of Rome's founding tells us this about the kings  and the hills:\nRomulus first built on the Palatine\nand the  Capitoline.\nWhen Tullus defeated the  Albans, the Caelian was included in the city. \nAncus annexed the Aventine to the city limits.\nServius added to the city the Quirinal,\nthe Viminal, \nand  later the Esquiline.\nWhile the Emperor Aurelian during his reign from 270-275 AD extended  Rome's walls further than these hills, the old \"Wall of Servius\" included just these seven (most  of the Caelian and the Esquiline, and all of the other five) within Rome's limits. This  Wall of Servius was named after the sixth king who had supposedly extended  the walls that far, but modern authorities feel it was built after the  Gauls destroyed Rome in 390 BC. Regardless of which is true, in John's day  there were just seven hills enclosed by the walls of Rome.\nOne Possibility Left\nSince all of  the seven original kings of Rome were kings of Rome,  and since all the seven hills of Rome were within the walls of Rome, it  would make sense for the seven kings of Revelation 17 to also all be in  some way a part of Rome. This suggests that we should consider the idea  that the seven kings of Revelation 17 are seven forms of government within  Rome.\nSignificance of the Crowns\nAnd there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.  (Rev. 12:3)\nThe crowns are upon the heads. Why?\nWhile the dragon is primarily Satan, it is also secondarily pagan Rome,  since it was through pagan Rome that Satan persecuted the church after  Christ's ascension (Rev. 12:5, 6, 12, 13). Since pagan Rome had a strong  central government, having crowns upon the seven heads of the dragon makes  sense.\nAnd I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.  (Rev. 13:1)\nNo crowns are upon the heads. Instead, they are upon the horns. Why?\nPapal Rome was not the strong central government that pagan Rome had  been. Papal Rome consisted of independent, sovereign nations held together by  a common religion headed by the pope. Crowns upon  the horns instead of upon the heads symbolized this fact. It was the horns  that were sovereign, not the beast itself.\nA similar picture is  found in Daniel 2. Clay holds together iron fragments, somewhat, in the  feet and toes. Likewise, the beast holds together, somewhat, the ten horns  with their crowns. During the Middle Ages what  unity there was between the nations of Europe was only somewhat. It was  the papacy that provided a unifying force, but whatever unity was achieved  was never complete. Constantly there was political intrigue, political  differences, and outright war.\nSo he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.  (Rev. 17:3)\nThe beast of Revelation 17 has no crowns at all, suggesting that the  form of government being represented by this beast is one that has no  king. Indeed, this thought is not new.\n\"The beast that was,\" denotes the ROMAN REPUBLIC, that was 1900 years ago. \"And is not.\" That is, it was not when John was having his vision in A. D. 96, because Imperial Rome was then the form of government, and continued to be until A. D. 538, when the seventh form of government came, viz: Papal Rome. \"Even he is the eighth.\" The eighth undoubtedly is, as we have shown, the two-horned beast with its image, a symbol of the people of Republican America, as they are and will be. \"And is of the seven.\" The eighth will cause all under his influence to worship the one that is called the seventh.  (Joseph Bates, Advent Review, 8/5/1851, p.4)\nThe present author would differ a little with the above, but the point  is that Bates identified the beast of Revelation 17, the one without  crowns, as being a republic, a revival of the republicanism of old Rome, a  republicanism that was dead at the time John wrote the book of Revelation.  This coincides with the idea that the absence of crowns indicates a  government that has no king.\nSearch for a Common Tie\nFour passages are linguistically tied together in Revelation, while  their typical interpretations have been totally unrelated.\nAnd they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name  Apollyon. (Rev. 9:11)\nAnd when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.  (Rev. 11:7)\nThe beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition:  (Rev. 17:8)\nAnd I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.  (Rev. 13:11)\nTypically, historicists have identified the beast from the bottomless  pit in chapter 11 as being France during its Revolution, while the beast  from the bottomless pit of chapter 17 has been identified as a  revived papacy. The king, the angel of the bottomless pit of chapter 9,  has been identified in some way with Islam (see \"The  Seven Trumpets of Revelation, Were the Later Reformers Right?\" ).  The beast of Revelation 13 that has no crowns on either his head or  his horns, just like the beast of Revelation 17, has been identified with  the United States. Four very different interpretations. Is there nothing that ties these symbols together?\nThere indeed is something, and that something is republicanism. An atheistic  brand of republicanism or democracy wrecked havoc during the French  Revolution. A Protestant brand of republicanism gave birth to the freedoms  found in the United States. And the Moslems?\nIn Mecca despotism was impossible. The fierce, free-born  Arabs of the desert would tolerate no master, and their innate democracy  had been sanctioned by the Prophet, who had explicitly declared that all Believers  were Brothers. The Meccan caliphate was a theocratic democracy. Abu Bekr  and Omar were elected by the people, and held themselves responsible to  public opinion . . . . (Lothrop Stoddard, The New World of  Islam 6, 7)\nSo when we read, \"And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into  perdition\" (Rev. 17:11), we are reading about a confederacy of republics, a revival of the  republican form of government of old Rome. Republicanism and democracy is  the only conceivable tie between the four passages.\nThis Beast, That Beast, Which Beast?\nRevelation talks about the dragon and several beasts. How do we keep  from confusing one beast with another?\nRevelation 13 gives us a clue. The  first beast of Revelation 13:1-10 seems to be consistently called  throughout the book \"the beast.\" The second beast of 13:11 is  identified as \"another beast,\" and then is never called a \"beast\" again. Instead, to prevent confusion, he is called the \"false prophet\" in Revelation 16:13; 19:20; and 20:10. In all  three of these passages he appears along side \"the beast.\" Both  are pictured together. One is called \"the beast,\" and the other  is called \"the false prophet.\"\nWhat this suggests is that whenever we read about \"the  beast,\" we must be reading about the first beast of Revelation 13.\nIf John sees things that he has already seen before, he prefaces his  words with \"the.\" If he is seeing something new, he omits the \"the.\"\nSo he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast . . . . (Rev. 17:3)\nApparently John is indicating that he is seeing something new,  something different than \"the beast\" he saw in Revelation 16:13.  We would then expect that in every place afterwards where the first beast  of Revelation 13 is intended, he will be identified as \"the  beast.\" In every place where the beast of Revelation 17 is intended,  some sort of qualifier will be added to enable us to distinguish him from  the first beast of Revelation 13.\nWhat makes this more apparent is the fact that Revelation 16:13  pictures the dragon, beast, and false prophet all involved in getting  people to the Battle of Armageddon. Then we have the scarlet beast of  Revelation 17. Then we have an actual picture of the Battle of Armageddon  in Revelation 19:19 ff., in which the dragon, beast, and false prophet are  all seen. Clearly, the beast of 16:13 must be the same as the beast of  19:20. In as much as the scarlet beast of chapter 17 is \"a  beast\" instead of \"the beast,\" he must be a totally  different beast set apart by some sort of qualifiers wherever he is  mentioned.\nVerse-by-Verse Analysis\nAnd the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.  (Rev. 17:7)\nWhich beast? Clearly the qualifier identifies this beast as the one  John just saw, the scarlet beast.\nThe beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.  (Rev. 17:8)\nWhich beast? The scarlet beast. Republicanism was the order of  the day before Augustus Caesar. It was not in John's day. It would ascend and be a dominant force in the end.\nInterestingly, not until World War I did this even begin to come true  (though it almost did during the revolutions of 1848). During World War I,  the monarchies of Turkey, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Russia all met  their demise, and the world has been marching on toward a  confederacy of republics and democracies ever since. Not that communist  Russia fit the bill, but that's where the world has been heading ever  since World War I.\nAnd here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.  (Rev. 17:9, 10)\nAs mentioned before, the interpretation being suggested here typically identifies the first five kings as being five of the  following forms of government: a) kings, b) consuls, c) dictators, d)  decemvirate, e) military tribunes with consular power, and f)  triumvirate. Some expositors have left out military tribunes, and others have left  out  the triumvirate, but both of these were legitimate heads of the government  at one time or another. Perhaps the simplest solution to needing to choose five  of the six is to start with the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. This  then leaves out the monarchial from of government from the list. Would  this be permissible?\nThe records of the seven monarchs who reigned before the Republic start  with Romulus. His father was said to be the god Mars, and he was suckled  as an infant by a she-wolf. Obviously, there are aspects of the story that  are fictitious. For such reasons, the list of seven kings is often called \"legendary.\"\nThe last three of the seven monarchs were Etruscans, not  Romans. After the founding of the Republic in 509 BC, we have Rome being  ruled by Romans. This suggests that perhaps we should start the five at  that time.\nDaniel 7:7 said that Rome was diverse from all other beasts before it,  and it was. Babylon, Persia, and the Grecian Empire founded by Alexander  did not repeatedly change their form of government like Rome did. They also were  monarchies, not  republics. Rome indeed was diverse.\n. . . and one is . . . . (Rev. 17:10)\nThe imperial form of government was the one that existed in John's day.  This would be the sixth head.\n. . . and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.  (Rev. 17:10)\nSome have suggested that the seventh head was the Exarch of Ravenna.  Since he didn't rule from Rome, this does not seem likely. Each of the  seven heads should be a form of government that ruled from the seven  hilled city of Rome.\nIt therefore seems more probable that this seventh head is the medieval  papacy. Yet how could his 1260-year-long reign be considered a short  space?\nTherefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. (Rev. 12:12) \nThis is spoken probably soon after Christ's ascension (Rev. 12:5). The \"short time\" the devil has would then last from Christ's  ascension to the end of time. If  the last 2000 years can be called a \"short time,\" surely 1260  years can be called a \"short space.\"\nAnd the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.  (Rev. 17:11)\nWhich beast? The qualifier points back to verse 8, which in turn  pointed us to the scarlet beast. So the scarlet beast of Revelation 17  must be the \"eighth  king.\"\nInterestingly, there is an eighth hill of great significance over at  Rome. It sits across on the other side of the Tiber River from the  original seven. It is the Vatican. Aurelian's walls never surrounded it.  Until around 850 AD, it sat outside of Rome. After the papacy returned from  Avignon, France, in the 1370's, the Vatican Hill became the headquarters  for the papacy.\nThus we have a prophecy that the world in the end of time will become a  conglomeration of republics and democracies under the spiritual leadership  of the a papacy, the grand headquarters of which will be upon the eighth  hill.\nAnd the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but  receive power as kings one hour with the beast. (Rev. 17:12)\nA popular rendering of the phrase \"one hour\" has been \"at the same time.\" Thus these ten kings, already identified  with the ten toes and horns of Daniel 2 and 7, receive their kingdom at  the same time as the beast.\nWhich beast? Since there are no qualifiers here, the beast referred to  would be the first beast of chapter 13, not the scarlet beast of chapter  17. That being so, we have a picture here of the ten nations of western  Europe coming to power at the same time as the papacy did, and that is  precisely what happened during the fifth century.\nThese have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.  (Rev. 17:13)\nThis indeed happened during the Middle Ages, but it would appear that  the prophet is speaking more specifically of end-time events. Thus we have  a prediction that the ten horns, now republics and democracies instead of  monarchies, will again surrender their sovereignty in some way to the  papal power.\nSimilar wording is used in verse 17:\nFor God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.  (Rev. 17:17)\nThe woman who sits upon the scarlet beast must certainly be a  representation of at least the papacy. Thus when the ten kings give their  kingdom to the beast, this is the same as saying that they are giving  their kingdom to the woman. For this reason she was pictured riding upon  the scarlet beast, whom she had under her control. Yet a predicted change  is to come:\nAnd the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.  (Rev. 17:15)\nThe very ones who gave her her power would be the instruments of taking  it away. Thus it was in 1798. The French nation was to a large extent  responsible for the papacy's initial power. That very same nation took  that power away.\nThese shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.  (Rev. 17:14)\nWe are thus given a view of the political landscape of the world at the  time of the battle of Armageddon. Under the spiritual leadership of the  papacy, a conglomeration of republics and democracies unite in rebellion  against the mild and beneficient rule of Christ.\nOpinions of Other Writers\nIn all fairness I should acknowledge those who have expressed similar  opinions before me.\nW. B. Godbey in his Commentary on the New Testament says  regarding Revelation 12:3:\nThe seven heads and seven diadems emblematize the seven  governments of Rome, the mighty empire of Satan; i.e., the kings, consuls,  dictators, triumvirs, tribunes, emperors, and popes, who ruled the world  two thousand years. The ten horns are the ten great political powers into  which the Roman world was disintegrated when the barbarians dethroned the  Csars.\nRegarding Revelation 17:11, he states:\nThe kings, consuls, dictators, triumvirs,  tribunes, emperors, and popes constitute the seven heads of the Roman  beast.\nGodbey specifies the reign of the seventh, the popes, as being 1260  years. He identifies the beast who is an eighth as being the papacy in the  end of time.\nMatthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible states regarding  Revelation 17:7-14:\nThis beast was seven heads,  seven mountains, the seven hills on which Rome stands; and seven kings,  seven sorts of government. Five were gone by when this prophecy was  written; one was then in being; the other was yet to come. This beast,  directed by the papacy, makes an eighth governor, and sets up idolatry  again.\nFamily New Testament Notes on Revelation 17:10:\nThis is understood by many as  representing the seven forms of civil government which prevailed in Rome�kings,  consuls, dictators, decemvirs, military tribunes, emperors, and the  exarchate of Ravenna; for here, as in verse 12, a king  denotes not an individual, but a succession of rulers.\nThe learned Baptist commentator John Gill on Revelation 17:10:\n... but by the seven heads are meant so many forms of government  which took place successively in the Roman empire, and were all of them  idolatrous heads, as kings, consuls, dictators, decemvirs, tribunes,  emperors, and popes; it being usual for any sort of governors, or  governments and monarchies, to be called kings, ...\nAdam Clarke, the prominent Wesleyan commentator,  states on 6B:1167 of his work:\nThe seven heads of the beast are therefore the following:  The regal power, the dictatorship, the power of the praetors, the  consulate, the triumvirate, the imperial power, and the patriciate.\nUriah Smith wrote an  entire tract on the subject. Regarding Osiander he writes:\nAnd one of the earliest Protestant commentators, Osiander, as early as 1511, names the whole seven as we have them; namely, Kings, Consuls, Decemvirs, Dictators, Triumvirs, Emperors, and Popes, as the forms of Roman government represented by the seven heads of the dragon of Revelation 12, and the seven-headed beasts of Revelation 13 and Revelation 17. (The  Seven Heads 2)\nHe also writes concerning Elliot, and in the process refers to the  views of Mede, Newton, Daubuz, King James, Pareus, Aretius, Napier,  Brightman, and Fulco:\nElliott, in his Horae Apocalypticae, Vol. 3, page 102, introduces an argument to show that \"all the mutations of the seven-headed beast, from its earliest beginning to the end, must be confined to the seven-hilled locality;\" that is, to Rome. As to the application of the seven heads themselves, he further says on page 106: \"In explanation, then, of the first six heads, I adopt, with the most entire satisfaction, that generally  received Protestant interpretation, which, following the authoritative statements of Livy and Tacitus (the latter great historian John's own contemporary), enumerates Kings, Consuls, Dictators, Decemvirs, and Military Tribunes, and the five first constitutional heads of the Roman city and commonwealth; then, as the sixth, the Imperial head, commencing with Octavian, better known as Augustus Caesar.\" He then refers to the view of Mede and Bishop Newton, that the seventh head was the dukedom of Rome, under the Exarchate of Ravenna, about sixty years. Page 110. Further, on pages 119-121, he presents evidence to show that the papacy is the last, or eighth, head.  ... A footnote on the words, \"generally received Protestant interpretation,\" page 106, as quoted above, presents these facts: \"Daubuz, page 514, attributes its discovery to King James. But I find it noticed in the early Protestant commentator, Pareus, page 422, as the solution of Aretius, Napier, and Brightman; each of whom probably - some of them certainly - preceded King James.  ... \nAgain he quotes a work by Fulco on the Apocalypse, London, 1573, who, writing in Latin, gives the Latin name of the seven heads, as follows: \"Reges, Consules, Decemviri, Triumviri, Dectatores, Caesares, Pontifex\" (the pope).  (The Seven Heads 38,39)\nWilliam Miller expressed two different opinions on the matter:\nRepublican Rome had five different offices under that particular form  of government--her senatorial, tribunate, consular, decemvir, and tirumvirate.  These are fallen. One is, (that was when John wrote his prophecy,) Imperial,  and the other had not yet come, Kingly, which is the same as the  ten horns. ( Miller's Works 2:80) \nIN this verse we are taught that John had a vision, and saw himself  standing among the tumultuous nations of the earth; and he saw the Roman  kingdom rise up out of the nations, having seven forms, or all kinds of  governments, seven being a perfect number in this prophecy. Heads denote governments, or supreme power: 1, Republican; 2, Consular; 3,  Decemvir; 4, Dictatorial; 5, Triumvirate; 6, Imperial; 7, Kingly. (Remarks  on Revelation Thirteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth 5)\nQuestions and Answers\nQ. Can the word \"fallen\" refer to governments? Should  it not be applied to the death of individuals instead?\nA. In Acts 15:16, it is most definitely used to refer to a form of  government which has lost its power. As far as individuals go, it may be  doubtful that the word \"fallen\" can refer to a natural death. If  we interpret the seven kings as either seven emperors or seven popes, we  would have to have at least some of the first five dying natural deaths,  and then how could it be said that they had \"fallen\"?\nQ. I've heard that we should start the sequence of seven kings in  1929. What about this?\nA. A simple problem with this idea is that the seven popes identified  as coming after 1929 never ruled the seven hills. The papacy lost control  of the seven hills of Rome in 1870 for the last time. It seems more  appropriate to start the sequence while the woman still controlled the  seven hills.\nAnother problem is that we would then have the horns coming before the  heads. Unquestionably the ten horns must be the same as the ten toes and  horns of Daniel 2 and 7. If the heads don't come until 1929, then the  horns predate the heads by over 1400 years, for the horns all arose in the  fifth century.\nQ. Are you sure that we are talking about two different beasts in  Revelation 17, \"the beast\" and the scarlet beast?\nA. We have two possibilities: Either this one or the possibility that  the beast that ascends from the bottomless pit in chapter 11 is not the  same as the one that ascends from the bottomless pit in chapter 17. Though  both possibilities seem a bit awkward, which is the more plausible of the  two?\nIf the scarlet beast of chapter 17 is the papacy, it cannot also be the  beast that slays the witnesses in chapter 11 (cf. Great Controversy 268,  269). Yet in chapter 17 we definitely have the papacy brought to view (SDA  Bible Commentary 7:983). It appears that it is the woman that is the  papacy, not the beast she is riding upon (Ibid.). Thus we have the  woman of Revelation 17 representing the same power as the first beast of  Revelation 13, while the scarlet beast represents something that is  supporting her at some point in time.\n\n"
