Headliners - Ambling Along - NYTimes.com Headliners -    Ambling Along - NYTimes.com\nHeadliners;   Ambling Along\nPublished: July 8, 1990\nImelda Marcos had the shoes; now she has walked. In a case that began four years ago, Mrs. Marcos, the widow of former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, was acquitted by a Federal court jury in Manhattan last week of helping her husband loot $200 million from the Philippine treasury and then investing the proceeds in art, jewelry and prime New York City real estate. Though the charges against her included defrauding American banks, jurors said afterward that they questioned whether Federal prosecutors had the right to charge her with other offenses that she and her husband were said to have committed in the Philippines. When the Marcoses fled to Hawaii in 1986, she was seen as the free-spending wife - thousands of pairs of shoes were found in her Manila palace closets - of a corrupt despot. But after Mr. Marcos died last year, there seemed much less interest in punishing his spouse. Said one juror, ''Just because she was married to him doesn't make her guilty.''\nPhoto: Imelda Marcos (Reuters)\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n...
