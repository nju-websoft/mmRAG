Rischgitz/Getty Images\nJanuary 25, 2013\n10 things you need to know today\nToday's best articles\nThe week's best photojournalism\nDaily business briefing\nThis Sunday is the birthday of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, the English mathematician and writer whose most famous works include Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass, and The Hunting of the Snark.\nSuch works featured Carroll's specialty: coining blends and nonce words. Here are ten of our favorites:\n1. boojum\nThe boojum is \"a particularly dangerous variety of ' snark ,'\" an imaginary creature of Carroll's invention. The word boojum has inspired the naming of everything from \"a species of tree... native to Baja California, Mexico\" (found in 1922 by plant explorer Godfrey Sykes , who proclaimed, \"It must be a boojum!\"); to a supersonic cruise missile that \"was determined to be too ambitious a project... and was canceled in 1951\"; to \"a geometric pattern sometimes observed on the surface of superfluid helium-3,\" as named by physicist David Mermin in 1976.\nExample: But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day, / If your Snark be a Boojum!  For then / You will softly and suddenly vanish away, / And never be met with again!\"\n— Lewis Carroll, The Hunting of the Snark , 1876\n2. chortle\nTo chortle means \"to exclaim exultingly, with a noisy chuckle.\" According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), Carroll coined the word as a blend of chuckle and snort.\nExample: \"He chortled in his joy.\"\n—Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass , 1871\n3. frabjous \nFrabjous means \"great, wonderful, fabulous,\" and is a blend of either fabulous and joyous, or fair and joyous. \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" cries the narrator of The Jabberwocky upon learning that the Jabberwock has been slain.\nExample: \"'O frabjous day!' rejoiced Emma Dean, using her bath towel as a scarf and performing a weird dance about the room.\"\n4. galumph\nGalumph means \"to move heavily and clumsily,\" and is a blend of gallop and triumph.\nExample: \"I struggle to keep up on an particularly cold winter evening as I galumph my way across rough downland in pursuit of a tour guide.\"\n— Ian Vince, \" Stonehenge Landscape Can Still Surprise with Its Stunning Vistas ,\" The Telegraph, January 14, 2010\n5. jabberwocky\nThe Jabberwocky is \"a nonsensical poem that appears in Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll,\" while the Jabberwock is \"a fantastical dreaded monster with flaming eyes who is depicted\" in the poem. Regarding the word itself, according to Carroll: \"The Anglo-Saxon word 'wocer' or 'wocor' signifies 'offspring' or 'fruit'. Taking 'jabber' in its ordinary acceptation of 'excited and voluble discussion.'\" Jabberwocky came to mean \"nonsensical speech or writing\" around 1908, says the OED.\nExample: \"In theory, the pledge could do most of the same work if we had children say it in Anglo-Saxon or Arapaho, or if we replaced it with the lyrics to 'Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.' They're going to turn the words into jabberwocky anyway.\"\n— Geoff Nunberg, \" I Pledge Allegiance to Linguistic Obfuscation ,\" NPR, March 30, 2010\n6. mimsy \nMimsy was coined by Lewis Carroll in 1855 as a blend of miserable and flimsy. According to the OED, by 1880 mimsy also came to mean, in British English, \"prim; careful; affected; feeble, weak, lightweight.\" Mim is a much older word meaning \"primly silent,\" either imitative of the pursing up of the mouth, or coming from the Scottish Gaelic min, \"delicate, meek.\"\nExample: \"I mean, their hair looks like it was designed on a Spirograph in the dark, then carelessly flopped on to them from atop a rickety step ladder, while their fans are all exactly the kind of mimsy mugginses who 'Instagram' pictures of wheelie bins to stick on their Tumblr, because, you know, it's properly, like, photography, yeah?\"\n— Gareth Aveyard, \" This Week's New Singles ,\" The Guardian, January 6, 2012\n7. portmanteau word\nA portmanteau word is \"a word formed by merging the sounds and meanings of two different words.\" A portmanteau is \"a case used in journeying for containing clothing,\" and comes from the French porter, \"to carry,\" plus manteau, \"cloak.\" Carroll coined portmanteau word in 1882 based on the idea of \"two meanings packed up into one word,\" says the Online Etymology Dictionary .\nExample: \"Portmanteau words are now a staple of the magazine competition, and amid the waste of failed invention, every so often one meets a need: smog, stagflation, chocoholic. I don't know how we ever did without 'metrosexual', coined by my friend Mark Simpson.\"\n— Philip Hensher, \" Sarah Palin's Struggle with the English Language ,\" The Telegraph, July 21, 2010\n8. slithy\nIn 1855, Carroll combined slimy and lithe to form this nonce word. However,  slithy  as a variation of sleathy, \"slovenly, careless,\" has been around since 1622, says the OED. \nExample: \"Hearing these slithy and suggestive movements, I declined to remain any longer ignorant of their meaning.\"\n— Ernest Raymond, Tell England: A Study in Generatio n, 1922\n9. snark\nSnark  referring to \"an imaginary animal\" was coined by Carroll in 1876 in his poem, The Hunting of the Snark, according to the Online Etymology Dictionary. In the 1950s, snark was the \"name of a type of U.S. cruise missile and in 1980s of a type of sailboat .\" The word snark also has the meaning of \"to snore; to snort,\" which originated about 10 years before Carroll's imaginary animal, according to the OED. This gave rise to snarky, \"rudely sarcastic or disrespectful; snide,\" or \"irritable or short-tempered; irascible,\" around 1906, which gives us snark's modern meaning of \"snide remarks.\"\nExample: \"The Snark was one of that strange man's imaginary animals, but when novelist Heidi Julavitz used the word to describe unpleasantly critical book reviewers in her indifferently researched 2005 McSweeney's magazine article, the word gained, as they say, 'traction.'\"\n— Bob Hoover, \" Hunting Snarks with a Pop Gun ,\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 18, 2009\n10. vorpal\nVorpal meaning \"sharp or deadly\" was coined by Carroll in 1871. In the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, the  vorpal sword is a sword \"capable of decapitation, specifically through magical means,\" which aligns with the plot of The Jabberwocky: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! / He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back.\" \nExample: \"Because, really, there's nothing more grandiose and theatrical than the vorpal blade. It's the weapon of dueling gentlemen and swashbuckling adventurers, of knights in armor and the horse lords of Rohan.\"\n— Daniel Engber, \" Nerd Violence ,\" Slate, January 3, 2011\nMore from Wordnik...\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nLewis Carroll really did introduce the word “chortle” to the ... coined 1872 by Lewis Carroll in \"Through the Looking Glass ...

Through the Looking-Glass ... Jabberwocky - Lewis Carroll Jabberwocky - Lewis Carroll\n\"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?\nCome to my arm, my beamish boy!\nO frabjous day! Callooh!  Callay!\"\nHe chortled in his joy.\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe\n(Carroll, The Annotated Alice, 191-97).\n\"It seems very pretty,\" [Alice] said when she had finished it, \"but it's rather hard to understand! ...  Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas--only I don't exactly know what they are!\" (Carroll, The Annotated Alice, 197).  Alice's reaction to Lewis Carroll's poem \"Jabberwocky\" is relatively typical.  Few people understand what the poem is about.  \"...Somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate--,\" Alice continues (Carroll, The Annotated Alice, 197).  After all, what is a Jabberwock anyway, and how, exactly, does one chortle or galumph?  How is it that a poem can be full of nonsense, and seemingly devoid of meaning, but still sound like proper English?  The answer to these questions lies in Carroll's unique ability to manipulate language.\n\"Jabberwocky\" first appeared in Mischmasch, a magazine written both by and for the Carroll family, in 1855 when Carroll was 23.  Titled \"Stanza of Anglo-Saxon Poetry,\" it went like this:\nTwas Bryllyg, and ye slythy toves\nDid gyre and gymble in ye wabe:\nAll mimsy were ye borogoves;\nAnd ye mome raths outgrabe\n(Martin Gardner, The Annotated Alice, 191).\nCarroll later expanded and revised the spelling of his poem for inclusion in Looking-Glass.  He gave the following as the literal English of the passage.  \"It was evening, and the smooth active badgers were scratching and boring holes in the hill-side; all unhappy were the parrots; and the grave turtles squeaked out\" (Gardner, The Annotated Alice, 192).\nBefore incorporating \"Jabberwocky\" into Looking-Glass, however, Carroll apparently changed his mind as to what some of his words should mean, for when Alice discusses the poem with Humpty Dumpty later in the book, he gives somewhat different interpretations.\n\"That's enough to begin with,\" Humpty Dumpty interrupted: \"there  are plenty of hard words there. 'Brillig' means four o' clock in  the afternoon--the time when you begin broiling things  for dinner.\"\n\"That'll do very well,\" said Alice: \"and 'slithy'?\"\n\"Well, 'slithy' means 'lithe and slimy,' 'Lithe' is the  same as 'active.'  You see it's like a portmanteau--there are  two meanings packed up into one word.\"\nThis is the first of several portmanteaus that Carroll used in \"Jabberwocky.\"\n\"I see it now,\" Alice remarked thoughtfully: \"and what are  'toves'?\"\n\"Well, 'toves' are something like badgers--they're  something like lizards--and they're something like  corkscrews.\"\n\"They must be very curious-looking creatures.\"\n\"They are that,\" said Humpty Dumpty: \"also they make their nests  under sundials--also they live on cheese.\"\n\"And what's to 'gyre' and to 'gimble'?\"\n\"To 'gyre' is to go round and round like a gyroscope.  To  'gimble' is to make holes like a gimlet.\"\n\"And 'the wabe' is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I  suppose?\" said Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.\n\"Of course it is.  It's called 'wabe,' you know, because  it goes a long way before it, and long way behind it--\"\n\"And a long way beyond it on each side,\" Alice added.\n\"Exactly so.  Well then,'mimsy' is 'flimsy and miserable'  (there's another portmanteau for you).  And a 'borogove'  is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all  round--something like a live mop.\"\n\"And then 'mome raths'?\" said Alice.  \"I'm afraid I'm  giving you a great deal of trouble.\"\n\"Well, a 'rath'is a sort of green pig: but 'mome'  I'm not certain about.  I think it's short for 'from  home'--meaning that they'd lost their way, you know.\"\n\"And what does 'outgrabe' mean?\"\n\"Well, 'outgribing' is something between bellowing and  whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you'll  hear it done, maybe--down in the wood yonder--and, when you've  once heard it, you'll be quite content.\"\n(Carroll, The Annotated Alice, 270-2).\nUnfortuantely, this is where Humpty Dumpty, and Carroll, ends his interpretation.  We can, however, by means of several methods determine what Carroll is likely to have meant by most of his nonsense words.\nThe first of these methods is to consider what Carroll told confused readers.  For example, in 1877 he wrote to Maud Standen, one of his child-friends, that \"uffish\" suggested to him \"a state of mind when the voice is gruffish, the manner roughish and the temper huffish\" (Gardner, The Annotated Alice, 196).  In the same letter he points out that \"burble\" can be created in the following manner: \"If you take the three verbs 'bleat 'murmur,' and warble,'and select the bits I have underlined, it certainly makes 'burble': though I am afraid I can't distinctly remember having made it in that way\" (Gardner, The Annotated Alice, 196).  Carroll also reused eight of the nonsense words for \"Jabberwocky\" in his nonsense poem \"The Hunting of the Snark.\"  One of these words, \"frumious,\" is explained in the preface.\n... take the two words \"fuming\" and \"furious.\"  Make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say first.  Now open your mouth and speak.  If your thoughts incline ever so little towards \"fuming,\" you will say \"fuming-furious\"; if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards \"furious,\" you will say \"furious-fuming\"; but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say \"frumious\"\n(Gardner, The Annotated Alice, 195).\nSeveral of Carroll's words have become so much a part of our language that they can be found in the Oxford English Dictionary.  In addition to several of the words defined by Humpty Dumpty, these include \"galumph,\" which is defined as a combination of \"gallop\" and \"triumphant\" and means \"to march on exultantly with irregular bounding movements\" (Gardner, The Annotated Alice, 196), and \"chortle\" which is defined as a combination of \"chuckle\" and \"snort\" (Gardner, The Annotated Alice, 197).  It is fairly safe to assume that these are the definitions that Carroll wanted attached to his words.\nThe final thing to be considered when attempting to find meaning in \"Jabberwocky\" is that Victorian culture was very different from that of today.  Many of Carroll's words may seem like nonsense to us, but may have held more meaning for Victorians reading his book.  For example, \"whiffling,\" however unfamiliar it may seem to us today is actually not a Carrollian word at all.  The generally accepted meaning during the 1800s was in reference \"to blowing unsteadily in short puffs, hence it came to be a slang term for being variable and evasive\" (Gardner, The Annotated Alice, 196).  \"Snicker-snack,\" is another word which would have been more familiar to Carroll's contemporaries than it is to us. It is probably related to \"snicker-snee,\" an old word which could be used either as a noun, to mean a large knife, or as a verb, to mean fighting done with such a knife (Gardner, More Annotated Alice, 178).  The final example of this type is the father's frabjous chortling of \"Callooh! Callay!\"  Most likely, Carroll had in mind two forms of the word kalos, which in Greek can mean \"beautiful,\" \"good,\" or \"fair,\" and which would have been pronounced \"Callooh\" and \"Callay\" (Gardner, More Annotated Alice, 178).\nIt is important to note that although without detailed explanation it is difficult to decipher the meaning of the poem, it is still clearly recognizable as being written in English.  Carroll used several techniques to keep \"Jabberwocky\" from becoming complete nonsense.  The first, and most basic, technique used is that all of Carroll's manufactured words look as if they could be real.  The vowel and consonant combinations appear genuine and are easily pronounced, unlike, for example, the Gryphon's exclamation, \"Hjckrrh!\" in Wonderland which could not be mistaken for an actual English word (Beverly Lyon Clark \"Carroll's Well Versed Narrative: Through the Looking-Glass\" Critical Views 130).  The second technique that Carroll used was to make most of his nonsense words nouns and adjectives with comparatively few nonsense verbs (Richard Kelly, Lewis Carroll, 57).  This allows us to understand, as Alice puts it, that \"somebody, killed something,\" as the actions being performed are clear, even if who or what is doing them is not.  The third, and final, technique that Carroll used to keep his poems from becoming meaningless is the fact that he used the sound of his words rather than the meaning of the words to express the meaning of the poem.  For example, such harsh words as \"vorpal,\" \"snicker-snack,\" and \"galumph,\" serve to heighten the tension of \"Jabberwocky\" just as similar sounding non-nonsense words might do in any other poem (\"Jabberwocky\" Fr. The World's Best Poetry on CD 6).\nAnother technique that Carroll uses to make Jabberwocky intelligible is his placement of the words in the sentences.  Actually this is two-fold. Carroll uses the placement of his words in their sentences to tell us their meanings, and the words placement within the sentences reveal their meanings.  This is because, while it is not possible to tell whether a word such as \"brillig\" is an noun, verb, or adjective. Sentences such as \"Look at that brillig,\" \"I brillig every night before I go to bed,\" and \"What a brillig cat that is\" are all sound equally correct (and non-sensical).  It is only from its placement in the sentence that we can determine how it functions within the sentence.  It is immediately clear why this is when we remove all of Carroll's nonsense words from the first to lines of \"Jabberwocky:\" \"Twas [blank] and the [blank] [blanks] did [blank] and [blank] in the [blank].\"  The first blank is describing how it was, so \"brillig\" must be an adjective. The second two blanks appear to work as a group, and since they are both preceded by a \"the,\" we can assume that the \"rath\" is a noun, and \"mome\" is the adjective which describes it.  Similarly, the final blank, \"wabe,\" also preceded by a definite article, must be a noun.  The remaining two blanks, \"gyre\" and \"gimble,\" must be verbs because they follow \"did,\" which is generally followed by a verb or two in situations such as this.  It is in this manner that we are able to use our ingrained knowledge of the English language to help us understand what is happening in \"Jabberwocky.\"  Carroll knew this, and arranged his words in a way which would facilitate this type of subconscious analysis.\nCopyright 1997 by Cathy Dean .

It was Lewis Carroll in Through The Looking Glass who coined the word portmanteau to describe them. ... chortle: chuckle + snort: Portmanteau Words - TalkTalk Portmanteau Words\nPortmanteau Words\nThe standard linguistic term for this type of word is a blend. It was Lewis Carroll in Through The Looking Glass who coined the word portmanteau to describe them. In the book Humpty Dumpty explains that: \"Well, 'slithy' means 'lithe and slimy'. 'Lithe' is the same word as 'active'. You see, it's like a portmanteau - there are two meanings packed into one word.\" Among several other words Carroll created chortle (a combination of 'chuckle' and 'snort') and galumph ( a combination of 'gallop' and 'triumph').\nSo, a portmanteau or blend word is one derived by combining portions of two or more separate words. Interestingly, portmanteau itself is a blend word, originating from the French portemanteau, a compound formed from porter (to carry) and manteau (cloak).\nadvertainment\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nAlthough the poem was first published in Lewis Carroll's novel Through the Looking Glass ... A Short Analysis of ‘Jabberwocky’ by Lewis ... I like making up words ... A Short Analysis of ‘Jabberwocky’ by Lewis Carroll ... A Short Analysis of ‘Jabberwocky’ by Lewis Carroll | Interesting Literature\nA Short Analysis of ‘Jabberwocky’ by Lewis Carroll\nPosted by interestingliterature\nA summary and analysis of Lewis Carroll’s classic nonsense poem ‘Jabberwocky’\n‘Jabberwocky’ is perhaps the most famous nonsense poem in all of English literature. Although the poem was first published in Lewis Carroll ‘s novel Through the Looking Glass in 1871, the first stanza was actually written and printed by Carroll in 1855 in the little periodical Mischmasch, which Carroll (real name Charles Dodgson) compiled to entertain his family. Below is ‘Jabberwocky’ (sometimes erroneously called ‘The Jabberwocky’), followed by a brief analysis of its meaning. ‘Nonsense’ literature it may be, but let’s see if we can make some sense of the glorious nonsense.\n‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n‘Beware the Jabberwock, my son!\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\nBeware the Jubjub bird, and shun\nThe frumious Bandersnatch!’\nHe took his vorpal sword in hand:\nLong time the manxome foe he sought—\nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree,\nAnd stood awhile in thought.\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood,\nThe Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,\nAnd burbled as it came!\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through\nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\nHe left it dead, and with its head\nHe went galumphing back.\n‘And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?\nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!’\nHe chortled in his joy.\n‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\nIn terms of its plot, ‘Jabberwocky’ might be described as nonsense literature’s answer to the epic Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf : what Christopher Booker, in The Seven Basic Plots, calls an ‘overcoming the monster’ story. A hero leaves home and goes out into the world in order to face down some evil; after encountering difficulties and tests of his bravery, he is triumphant and vanquishes his foe; and then he comes home again. It’s a story told again and again\nin literature, from Beowulf to The Lord of the Rings. The structure of Carroll’s poem echoes this basic plot structure in two ways: through adopting the ballad metre traditionally used for poems telling such a story (that is, the four-line stanza, or quatrain form), and through repeating the opening stanza in the closing stanza, suggesting the hero’s return home after his adventure.\nThe poem is also a masterpiece of linguistic inventiveness: every stanza is a feast of neologisms – new words, coinages, nonsense formations. Several of them have even entered common usage: ‘chortle’ (a blend of ‘chuckle’ and ‘snort’) and ‘galumph’ (meaning to move in a clumsy way) are both used by many people who probably have no idea that we have Lewis Carroll to thank for them. (‘Mimsy’, too, is often credited to Carroll – though it actually existed prior to the poem.)\nIndeed, as well as being a fine piece of imaginative literature, ‘Jabberwocky’ also demonstrates a central principle of language: what linguists call productivity or open-endedness, namely the phenomenon whereby users of a language can endlessly create new words or phrases. As Noam Chomsky has shown, users of a language demonstrate an innate linguistic creativity from a young age, and this is how children are able to pick up a new language relatively quickly: they learn not simply by acquiring knowledge, but by using an in-built talent for spotting how words are put together to form meaningful utterances. If something is both lithe and slimy, why not combine the two words – both their sounds and their meanings – to create slithy? The second word of the poem, ‘brillig’, is a word for ‘four o’clock in the afternoon’, the time when people begin boiling things for dinner (as Humpty Dumpty explains to Alice in Through the Looking-Glass in his analysis of the words, when she asks him what the words of the poem mean).\nFor more information about what individual words of the poem mean, see Humpty Dumpty’s explanation of ‘Jabberwocky’ from Through the Looking-Glass.

Discover nine novel English neologisms now by Dictionary.com Discover nine novel English neologisms now by Dictionary.com\nNerd\n[nurd]\nThe slang term nerd means an intelligent but single-minded person, obsessed with a certain hobby or pursuit, e.g. a computer nerd. But the word that has been the bane of so many elementary schooler's existence was actually invented by their king: none other than Dr. Seuss himself! The word first appeared in print in Seuss's 1950 picture book, If I Ran the Zoo, though Seuss's 'nerd' is a small animal from the land of Ka-Troo, not a pale kid with glasses taped together.\nYahoo\n[yah-hoo]\nThe origin of this word may add some unexpected irony to the well-known internet browser. Originally coined by Jonathan Swift in his 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels, Yahoo refers to the brutish race of homo sapiens ruled by the Houyhnhnm, a noble race of speaking horses. Swift's Yahoo's display all of the vices of humanity with none of the virtues, thus it makes sense that the word has come to mean 'a course or brutish person.' If you say 'yahoo' loud enough you might be moved to experience our next neologism.\nChortle\n[chawr-tl]\nLewis Carroll coined this funny term for a gleeful chuckle in his 1872 novel, Through the Looking Glass, the sequel to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In the novel, the word appears in a verse poem titled \"The Jabberwocky,\" in which Alice finds a book that can only be read using a mirror. The old man in the poem \"chortles in his joy\" when his son beheads the terrible monster. Today the word is widely thought to be a combination of 'chuckle' and 'snort.'\nQuark\n[kwawrk, kwahrk]\nA quark can be any group of elementary particles that combine to become a subatomic particle such a neutron or proton. In other words, quarks are some of the smallest building blocks of an atom. In 1964 the U.S. physicist Murray Gell-Mann named the particle after a word he found in James Joyce's novel, Finnegan's Wake. Joyce's quotation reads, \"Three quarks for Muster Mark,\" with 'quark' referring to the cry of the seagull.\nUtopia\n[yoo-toh-pee-uh]\nUtopia is the title of Sir Thomas More's whimsical and satirical book written in 1516. More envisions a perfect society situated on an island that he names Utopia. Developing the word from the Greek topos for 'place,' More choose the prefix ou- or u- meaning 'not' or 'no.' Thus the name Utopia quite literally means no place at all. Even though More might have his reservations about the achievability of a perfect world, our next neologism might be the closest thing to a perfect sound.\nTintinnabulation\n[tin-ti-nab-yuh-ley-shuhn]\nThe American poet and author Edgar Allen Poe coined this onomatopoetic word in his 1849 poem \"The Bells.\" The poem was published shortly after Poe's death, and though the four sections of the piece become progressively darker as Poe describes four different types of bells, tintinnabulation characterizes the joyous sound of silver sleigh bells, foretelling \"a world of merriment.\" The word is derived from the Latin tinnire meaning 'to ring' combined with the instrumental suffix 'bulum.'\nGrok\n[grok]\nDo you feel like nobody groks you? Don't worry, Robert A. Heinlein does. In his 1961 best-selling science fiction novel, Stranger in a Strange Land, Heinlein coined the term to mean an understanding so thorough that \"the observer becomes a part of the observed--to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience.\" But in common usage the term means to communicate sympathetically or to 'drink in' understanding. If you're reading this slideshow off a screen, you'll definitely grok our next neologism.\nCyberspace\n[sahy-ber-speys]\nThough you might not want to build a house there, anyone with a computer has a stake in cyberspace. Coined by the science fiction writer William Gibson, cyberspace first appeared in a 1982 short story. The word combines the terms 'cybernetics' (the use of mechanical and electronic systems to replace human function) and 'space' (an area or realm). Together they form 'cyberspace,' the realm of electronic communication or virtual reality. If you've ever thought 'virtual reality' was a bit of an oxymoron, you might be familiar with our final neologism.\n\n"
