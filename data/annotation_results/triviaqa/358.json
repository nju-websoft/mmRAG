Office of the Historian, ... since the signing of the ANZUS treaty in 1951 - State Milestones: 1945–1952 - Office of the Historian\nMilestones: 1945–1952\nThe Australia, New Zealand and United States Security Treaty (ANZUS Treaty), 1951\nThe Australia, New Zealand and United States Security Treaty, or ANZUS Treaty, was                     an agreement signed in 1951 to protect the security of the Pacific. Although the agreement has not been formally                     abrogated, the United States and New Zealand no longer maintain the security                     relationship between their countries.\nSecretary of State Dean Acheson speaking at an ANZUS Conference\nAt the onset of the Second World War, both Australia and New Zealand were members                     of the British Empire, so when Britain entered the conflict they did as well.                     During the course of the war, these two geographically isolated nations faced                     the threat of direct attack for the first time in their histories as modern                     states. As the Japanese expanded south into the Pacific Ocean, mainland                     Australia and especially the city of Darwin suffered frequent Japanese air raids                     in 1942 and 1943. After the sudden fall of the strategically important British                     colony of Singapore to the Japanese on February 15, 1942, the Antipodean nations                     expressed concern that the British Government was too focused on the war in                     Europe to protect its colonies properly and they began for the first time to                     look to the United States to help ensure their security.\nAs the other Allied powers turned their attention to the reconstruction of                     postwar Europe and Japan in the post World War II era, the governments of                     Australia and New Zealand remained concerned about the possibility of future                     Japanese expansionism and grew apprehensive about the rise of communism,                     particularly in East Asia. Even before the war ended, Australia and New Zealand                     signed an agreement stating that they had common goals and would work together                     in the international arena; at the time, the agreement was for both nations the                     first treaty negotiated independently, and it reflected the concern that the                     major powers of the United States and the United Kingdom may not take Australian                     and New Zealander issues into account in their postwar planning. The signing of                     the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949, in which the United Kingdom, Canada, and the                     United States alongside the Western European powers committed to a mutual                     defense arrangement, further prompted the geographically distant countries of                     Australia and New Zealand to seek their own security guarantee and means of                     integration in the international system in the postwar order.\nAustralia initially considered the idea of a regional pact in the Pacific in the                     1930s, and in 1946, at a meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers, it                     suggested that the major powers of the British Commonwealth form a regional                     defense system. If such an organization were created, the members could then                     invite the United States and other countries with strong interests in the                     Pacific to join. At that time, however, the United States was not yet prepared                     to commit itself to formal security arrangements in the Pacific. During the late                     1940s, the United States was heavily engaged in the rebuilding of Japan, but the                     United States did not extend its defense interests far beyond Japanese territory                     before the Korean War. In response to Australian suggestions for a regional                     coalition, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson stated that formal treaties with the South Pacific nations were unnecessary, as                     any real attack on Australia or New Zealand would elicit a U.S. response even                     without formal treaties in place to guarantee it. Moreover, the situations in                     the Atlantic and the Pacific were quite different, so there was no question of                     simply creating a “Pacific Treaty Organization” to parallel NATO. The Pacific                     Ocean was much larger, and the nations that bordered it were far more culturally                     and linguistically diverse than the nations of the North Atlantic. Other                     considerations led the United States to hesitate to commit to a regional                     organization in the Pacific as well. A number of the countries in Southeast Asia                     were still under colonial rule, or in the process of developing as independent                     states, and therefore neither they nor their colonial governments were in a                     position to make regional security commitments. At this time, the United States                     was also faced with the critical situation in Europe, including the occupation                     and support of West Germany and West Berlin and facing what it saw as the Soviet                     threat on that continent. There were fewer immediate economic or political                     threats to force equal attention to the security of the Southwest Pacific.\nSeveral developments in Asia between 1949 and 1951 helped to change U.S.                     perceptions about the utility of a formal security arrangement. The communist                     victory in the Chinese Revolution in 1949 seemed to confirm fears that communism                     was spreading in East Asia as well as in Europe. In 1950s, the outbreak of the                     Korean War led Australia and New Zealand to commit troops through the United                     Nations and alongside the NATO allies, demonstrating both their concern over the                     threat of communism and their commitment to doing their part to help contain it                     in the region. Most importantly, the U.S. decision to end the occupation of                     Japan and seek a peace treaty was met with great suspicion and disapproval from                     officials in the South Pacific, and that made the United States more willing to                     develop a security treaty to gain Antipodean support for the final peace                     agreement. In April of 1951, U.S. President Harry Truman announced that negotiations on a tripartite security treaty between the United                     States, Australia and New Zealand would occur concurrently with the negotiations                     for a final peace treaty with Japan. Both treaties were concluded in mid-1951,                     and the ANZUS Treaty was ratified by the United States and entered into force in                     1952.\nAlthough Britain also maintained an obligation to help defend Australian and New                     Zealander security as the leader of the Commonwealth, it was not invited to join                     the agreement. There were several reasons for the omission. One important                     concern was that extending the invitation to Britain would have required the                     signatories to open the opportunity to other European powers with colonial                     interests in the region. Another was the fact that British forces were already                     engaged in Europe and the Middle East, not to mention committed to the rest of                     the Commonwealth, making their actual intervention in the South Pacific in the                     event of a security crisis unlikely. Britain was also dealing with internal                     instability in its Asian colonies, including Malaya and Hong Kong, and that made                     the United States reluctant to sign an agreement that might obligate it to step                     in to resolve British colonial concerns. In any case, the British were already                     committed to U.S. security via NATO and to Australia and New Zealand via the                     Commonwealth, so its participation in a Pacific security arrangement with the                     United States, Australia, and New Zealand would have been somewhat redundant.                     All parties assumed that if the ANZUS Treaty was eventually extended to include                     other powers, however, the United Kingdom would be among the first to join.\nAlthough ANZUS was never expanded, the 1954 creation of the Southeast Asian                     Treaty Organization (SEATO) included all of the ANZUS powers, as well as                     Britain, France, and several other Asian powers, eliminating the impetus to                     change the foundation of the ANZUS Treaty. Over the course of the decades that                     followed the signing of the ANZUS Treaty, the members met annually to discuss                     their shared interests and concerns. These concerns increasingly focused on the                     spread of communism rather than the potential for Japanese militarization. Both                     Australia and New Zealand sent forces to support the U.S. effort in Vietnam,                     though without formally invoking the treaty.\nIn 1984, the ANZUS Treaty began to unravel when New Zealand declared its country                     a nuclear-free zone and refused to allow U.S. nuclear-powered submarines to                     visit its ports. Two years later, U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz and                     Australian Foreign Minister Bill Hayden concluded a series of bilateral talks by                     confirming that their countries would continue to honor their obligations to one                     another under the ANZUS Treaty, in spite of the fact that the trilateral aspects                     of the Treaty had been halted. On September 17, 1986, the United States                     suspended its treaty obligations toward New Zealand.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nFind out information about Pacific Security Treaty. a military ... and the USA formed by a treaty signed in San ...

Although the agreement has not been formally abrogated, the United States and New Zealand no longer maintain the security relationship between their countries.\nAt the onset of the Second World War, both Australia and New Zealand were members of the British Empire, so when Britain entered the conflict they did as well.

It was built in 1953 to commemorate America’s role in the Pacific War.

Australia was wary of this approach, especially in light of the Japanese attacks on Australian soil during the war.\nThis situation did however present an opportunity. Australia and New Zealand indicated they would support Japan’s rearmament, but only with agreement from the United States that it would assist them in the face of any hostility from another power. Australia and New Zealand proposed the ANZUS Treaty  and the United States eventually accepted despite some initial reluctance.\nThe negotiation of ANZUS was the first instance of Australia forming a political alliance without the involvement of Britain, causing some tension with ‘the motherland’. Britain believed that, as the head of the Commonwealth, it should be included. While it actively campaigned to become a joint signatory to the treaty however, the US, Australia and New Zealand refused to be moved on the issue.\nSigned in San Francisco on 1 September 1951, the treaty came into force on 29 April 1952 and was designed to remain so indefinitely.\nFrom left: Lieutenant-General Sydney Rowell, Australian Chief of General Staff, Major-General William Gentry, New Zealand Chief of General Staff and Admiral Arthur Radford, US Commander in Chief Pacific, gather in Honolulu for the first meeting of ANZUS military representatives on 21 September 1952. Australian War Memorial, P00474.020.\nANZUS on paper\nThe treaty itself has eleven articles that outline the commitments of Australia, New Zealand and the United States to one another. It requires each nation to ‘consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened in the Pacific’ and ‘act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes’.\nThe treaty also established a Council that is responsible for discussing such threats and appropriate responses.\nThe treaty does not specifically require Australia, New Zealand or the United States to provide military support to the other member states. ‘Acts to meet the common danger’ include the supply of resources or diplomatic involvement as well as armed intervention if necessary.\nANZUS in practice\nDespite being in operation for more than 60 years, the ANZUS treaty has only been formally invoked once. Then Australian Prime Minister John Howard did this in 2001 as a response to the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, leading to Australia’s involvement in the United States led ‘War on Terror’.\nAustralia’s commitment to other US-led causes such as the Vietnam War, while not formalised under ANZUS, have been linked to the treaty. Many political commentators suggested that Australia’s strong involvement in Vietnam was a means of proving our usefulness to the alliance, demonstrating Australian loyalty should we need US support in the future.\nThe ANZUS alliance has occasionally experienced difficulties. Australia has sometimes expressed disappointment at the minimal support received from the United States, especially during the Konfrontasi conflict in Indonesia and Malaysia in the early 1960s.\nThere has also been ongoing discussion about the contemporary relevance of an alliance that was created in a 1950s Cold War environment. Another pressure on the alliance is the fact that since the early 1980s the United States has effectively absolved itself of any obligation to New Zealand when the latter became a nuclear-free country and refused entry to its ports by potentially nuclear-capable US warships.\nFrom left: Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, US Secretary of State John Kerry, Australian Governor-General Peter Cosgrove, US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, and Australian Defence Minister David Johnston at Admiralty House, Sydney, while attending the annual AUSMIN meeting in August 2014.

However, while the alliance has not been formally revoked after the breakdown of relations between the United States and New Zealand, the original agreement between the three nations no longer fully exists in practice.\nNonetheless, the basic sentiment of the ANZUS alliance is still responsible for a number of current security-related activities between Australia and the United States, including:\nthe annual Australia–US Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN)\nintelligence and technology sharing\nmilitary exchange programs, and\ninternational military training exercises.\nAustralia has also continued to develop its regional relationship with New Zealand on a number of levels, collaborating on important peacekeeping missions including those in Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands, and undertaking joint military training and activities on a regular basis.\nFurther reading\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nSigned in 1951 alongside the Treaty of San ...

Revised in 1960, the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security grants the United States the right to military bases on the archipelago in exchange for a U.S. pledge to defend Japan in the event of an attack. The partnership has endured several geopolitical transitions, rooting its framework in the postwar security environment and expanding in the aftermath of the Cold War with the rise of China and a nuclearizing North Korea. Cooperation during the Gulf and Iraq wars and the March 2011 Tohoku earthquake reaffirmed the strength of the alliance, but challenges remain. The U.S. military presence on Okinawa, North Korea's nuclearization, territorial disputes with China, and Japan's recent push to upgrade its defense preparedness have all challenged the alliance's resilience as the Obama administration considers the direction of its strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific region.\nU.S.-Japan Defense Treaty\nSigned in 1951 alongside the Treaty of San Francisco that ended World War II, the original U.S.-Japan Mutual Security Treaty was a ten-year, renewable military agreement that outlined a security arrangement for Japan in light of its pacifist constitution. U.S. forces would remain on Japanese soil after Japan regained sovereignty. This early security pact with Washington dovetailed with the Yoshida Doctrine [PDF]—a grand strategy for postwar Japan laid out by then prime minister Yoshida Shigeru that saw Japan rely on the United States for its security needs so the country could focus on its own economic recovery.\nAt the time, the United States was keen on keeping its presence in Japan and using the alliance to bolster its strategic presence in East Asia. It faced a divided Korean peninsula in the wake of the Korean War, and a Cold War climate in which Chinese and Soviet militaries were expanding their breadth and capabilities. Against this security backdrop, Yoshida's government created the Self-Defense Force (SDF) in 1954, despite strong domestic objections based on Article Nine of the postwar constitution, which eschews the maintenance of military forces or the use of those forces to settle international disputes.\n\"With the ebb and flow of what's going on in the region, these are two countries that are highly incentivized to make this work.\" —Jennifer Lind\nJapan had assumed a minimal military role within the alliance in the early post–World War II years, interpreting the constitution to prevent the overseas deployment of Japanese troops. The value of the security pact to Washington, however, was the use of Japanese bases that allowed for the forward deployment of U.S. forces in Asia. The U.S. military used Japanese bases for combat operations during the Vietnam War, which drew vehement opposition in Japan and triggered fears of entrapment within the security alliance. In 1967, then prime minister Sato Eisaku enacted the Three Non-Nuclear Principles—no possession, production, or introduction—in part to allay concerns that the presence of nuclear arms on U.S. bases in Japan would expose the country to attacks. Since then, Japan has relied on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for extended deterrence.\nIn the 1970s, Japan began to increase its role within the alliance, while the United States disengaged from the Vietnam War. In 1976, Japan put out a National Defense Program Outline, its first comprehensive postwar defense strategy. Two years later, the 1978 Guidelines for Defense Cooperation it signed with the United States established a framework for the roles between the two militaries for Japan's defense. Washington and Tokyo began joint studies on interoperability and, most notably, launched joint training and exercises. The 1990–91 Gulf War prompted a new debate in Japan about SDF participation in UN-sponsored peacekeeping operations. A new law was adopted stipulating the conditions for SDF deployment abroad in UN peacekeeping operations, and the first SDF unit was sent to Cambodia.\nNorth Korea and the Nuclear Question\nThe fall of the Soviet Union marked a drastic shift in the regional security environment, with an ascendant China emerging alongside a nuclearizing North Korea. Pyongyang's fast-developing ballistic missile and nuclear program began to pose an existential military threat that exposed limitations [PDF] in the alliance.\nSuch fissures arose during the North Korean missile crisis of the mid-1990s. In May 1993, North Korea launched a Nodong missile into the Sea of Japan and withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to begin developing nuclear weapons material. The United States, keen on preserving stability in the region, found that Japan's constitutional limitations and the 1978 guidelines hindered its military preparations for a contingency on the peninsula. Exacerbating regional tensions was the 1996 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis [PDF], during which two U.S. aircraft carriers flew over the strait in response to Chinese missile tests.\nIn response to the burgeoning security instability, the alliance adopted the new U.S.-Japan Defense Guidelines in September 1997 that expanded the allowance of Japan's military operations from its home islands to \"surrounding areas\"—a move some perceived as Japan taking greater responsibility for its own defense. \"These crises reminded us in Washington and Tokyo that we weren't really quite out of the Cold War in Northeast Asia,\" says CFR Senior Fellow Sheila Smith. \"The flash points [in the 1990s] continued to challenge the alliance and its response.\"\nTokyo and Washington consolidated their development of ballistic missile defense programs after North Korea fired another missile over Japanese airspace in mid-1998. A 2006 nuclear test and more recent provocations from North Korea ignited a debate in Japan about the acquisition of nuclear weapons for its self-defense. In 2008, the Bush administration removed North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism in exchange for concessions on its nuclear program. The shift toward negotiations with Pyongyang triggered fears in Tokyo that Washington could accept a nuclear North Korea, diminishing the U.S. security guarantee for Japan.\nChina and the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands Dispute\nAs the United States makes its \"pivot\" to the Asia-Pacific region, China's rapid rise has been at the center of alliance concerns. In 2010, it surpassed Japan as the world's second-largest economy, and its growing assertiveness in the East and South China Seas have prompted worries about its regional ambitions. The escalating territorial dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, a cluster of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea, has riled bilateral relations and led many observers to fear a military clash in those waters. Although Washington has maintained that it does not take a stance on the islands' sovereignty status, it considers them to be under Japanese administration and thus covered by the security treaty.\n\"Here's an area where we see a really fascinating transformation in the alliance dynamic, where there's been a complete swing in the fear of entrapment,\" says Jennifer Lind, associate professor of government at Dartmouth College. \"For sixty years, the Japanese were afraid that we would drag them into a war. Now, we have the opposite problem in the Diaoyu/Senkakus.\"\nThough territorial skirmishes had flared in the area for years, Sino-Japanese relations hit a nadir in the summer of 2012, when Chinese activists landed on the disputed islands, triggering Japanese activists to reciprocate. Tokyo's government, led by then prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, proceeded to purchase three of the five islands from a private landowner for two billion yen in September, despite State Department warnings . The move ignited a wave of anti-Japanese protests across China that included a monthlong boycott of Japanese goods, bruising Japanese exports. The heightened tensions led the Japanese Coast Guard to bolster its surveillance of the waters and renew calls for stationing permanent structures and personnel on the islands.\nTensions flared again in November 2013, when China's Ministry of Defense announced the creation of an East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone . The protocol requires all noncommercial air traffic to submit flight plans before entering the area, which encompasses most of the East China Sea and includes the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. In response, U.S. secretary of defense Chuck Hagel reaffirmed that the U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty covered the disputed islands, and Vice President Joe Biden, on a week-long trip to the region, expressed deep concern regarding China's assertions. Further underscoring U.S. support for Japan's security, President Obama backed Tokyo's administration of the islands during an April 2014 visit to the region. \"What is a consistent part of the alliance is that the treaty covers all territories administered by Japan,\" he said.\nGiven the impasse between Beijing and Tokyo, many have called on the United States to increase its role as a mediator in the escalation.\n\"China will not listen to Japan about the [Diaoyu] Senkakus; it is only the United States that can deter their actions,\" said Yukio Okamoto, former special adviser to prime ministers Ryutaro Hashimoto and Junichiro Koizumi, in a September 2013 speech. \"The United States has an even bigger role—to not only mediate, but create a new framework of cooperation in the region.\"\nThe Okinawa Issue\nOne of the most contentious issues in the alliance has been the stationing of U.S. Marines on Japan's Okinawa prefecture, which hosts around 65 percent of total U.S. forces in Japan and is also the poorest of Japan's forty-seven prefectures. Locals deeply resent the outsize burden of hosting U.S. troops at the Futenma base and have voiced serious concerns about the accidents and incidents of crime (including recurring cases of sexual assault) that have persisted on the base. The gang rape of a twelve-year-old girl in 1995 by three U.S. servicemen galvanized eighty-five thousand locals to protest. A year after the mass demonstration, then prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto directly asked then U.S. president Bill Clinton to return Futenma to Japanese control. Other allegations of sexual violence by U.S. military personnel in Okinawa surfaced in 2008 and 2012 , and various plans for relocating Futenma were put forward, but they were met with local opposition.\nIn a more recent bid to reconcile tensions, the United States and Japan agreed in May 2006 to a U.S.-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation that would relocate the Futenma Air Station out of the crowded city of Ginowan, build a new runway in the waters off of Camp Schwab, and transfer eight thousand Marines to Guam. But this proposal devolved into a political maelstrom when the Democratic Party of Japan's Yukio Hatoyama, who opposed the relocation during his campaign, became prime minister in 2009.\nSince then, Washington and Tokyo have made other overtures to resolve the long-standing issue. The two parties altered the pact in April 2012, disconnecting the transfer of Marines from the construction of the new base, and in April 2013 they reached a deal to return Futenma—and five other U.S. bases—by the late 2020s.\n\"It's been very corrosive for the alliance,\" Smith says of the Okinawa issue. \"It has focused our attention on this one particular base, when the real challenge for the alliance has been to come up with a broader framework for the sustainability of U.S. forces in Japan.\"\nThe Future of the Alliance\nThe coordination between U.S. and Japanese military forces after the devastating March 2011 earthquake and consequent tsunami that struck Tohoku demonstrated the resilience of the alliance. The SDF conducted rescue operations in tandem with thousands of U.S. forces under Operation Tomodachi, the largest bilateral mission in the history of the alliance. U.S. forces aided the SDF in clearing Sendai's airport, assisted in search-and-rescue teams, and prepared Japan's defense readiness.\nThis high level of support echoed Japan's own cooperation during the Gulf and Iraq wars. In November 2001, the government of Junichiro Koizumi dispatched the Maritime Self-Defense Force to the Indian Ocean to support U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, marking Japan's first overseas military action during a combat operation. A year later, Japan drafted a bill that would allow the SDF to be dispatched to postwar Iraq, and in 2003 it sent forces to aid in postwar reconstruction efforts.\nAt a 2 + 2 meeting in early October 2013, the United States agreed to deploy reconnaissance drones to Japan, which also pledged up to $3.1 billion to relocate five thousand U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam. Ministers also agreed to rewrite the guidelines for U.S.-Japanese Defense Cooperation for the first time since 1997 in revisions that would expand cooperation on counterterrorism and bolster the allies' ability to respond to an attack on Japan.\n\"The United States has an even bigger role—to not only mediate, but create a new framework of cooperation in the region.\" —Yukio Okamoto, former special adviser to prime ministers Ryutaro Hashimoto and Junichiro Koizumi\nIn July 2014, Japan took a step toward a more active role in regional security when Abe announced that his cabinet had approved a reinterpretation of the antiwar Constitution that would allow Japanese forces to aid friendly nations under attack. The decision marks a significant shift from a position that had strictly limited Japan to act solely in its own defense. \"Japan, for half a century, has expanded its military capability in ways that raise questions about the interpretation of Article Nine in its constitution,\" says Smith. \"And the question has become, 'How much can Japan do in the alliance?'\"\nSome experts have defined the modern-day alliance to be more inclusive, advocating initiatives such as trade and energy cooperation as the road to a future framework. \"This is bigger than just the military. These are instruments we use to improve our own national prosperity and security, and that's fundamentally what this alliance should be about,\" Smith says.\nThe multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership has been a highly promising economic development that observers hope will tighten the alliance. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster forced Japan to reconsider its energy policies, Washington agreed to a long-term liquefied natural gas export deal with Japan that could see the United States become a supplier for the island country.\n\"This is the most relevant the alliance has been in a long time,\" says Lind. \"With the ebb and flow of what's going on in the region, these are two countries that are highly incentivized to make this work.\"\nAdditional Resources\nCFR's Sheila Smith delves into how the U.S.-Japan alliance fits into Asia's shifting geopolitics in this World Politics Review article and outlines a strategy for the alliance in this CFR Policy Innovation Memorandum .\nGeorge Packard reflects on the alliance on its fiftieth anniversary and debates its efficacy in this 2010 Foreign Affairs article .\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nSet forth below is a list of U.S. collective defense arrangements and ...
