History of Greece:The Revolution to the 20th Century History of Greece:The Revolution to the 20th Century\nHistory of Greece\nThe Greek Revolution of 1821\nContrary to popular opinion there never was a country called Greece or Hellas until the Revolution of 1821.  When rebellion against the Ottoman Empire gave birth to Hellas, Hellenic-speaking people had a national homeland for the first time in history.\nIn 1821 the land that was known as Greece is controlled by the Turks, except for the Ionian islands which has been occupied by the Venetians, then the French and in 1815 by the British. The rebellion of the Greeks actually begins in Moldavia when an army of 4500 Hellenes led by General Alexander Ypsilantis, a Phanariot from the so-named district of Istanbul, a member of the Philike Hetairia (Friendly Society), invades hoping to encourage the local Romanian peasants to throw off the yoke of the Turks. Instead they attack their wealthy countrymen and the Greeks have to escape. When the revolution breaks out in the Peloponessos, the Sultan in Istanbul hangs the Patriarch Grigorios V for failing to keep the Greek Christians in line which they considered his duty for the vast privileges they allowed him. The Phanariot Greeks fall in line behind the new patriarch and condemn the revolution. But in the Peloponessos the rebellion is making progress and  combined with Ali Pasha's rebellion in Ipirus the Turks have their hands full. On March 25th 1821 Bishop Germanos of Patras raises the flag of revolution at the monastery of Agia Lavra near Kalavrita and the battle cry of \"Freedom or Death\" becomes the motto of the revolution. But historian David Brewer in his Greece, The Hidden Centuries: Turkish Rule from the Fall of Constantinople to Greek Independence disagrees, stating that the story of the flag raising at Agia Lavra was apparently an invention by Francois Pouqueville, a prominent architect of the Philhellenism movement throughout Europe, who contributed to the liberation of the Greeks, and to the rebirth of the Greek Nation.\nNevertheless, fighting begins to break out all over with massacres committed by both the Greeks and the Turks. On the island of Chios 25,000 Greeks are killed while in the Peloponessos the Greeks kill 15,000 of the 40,000 Turks living there. It would be unfair to over-look Ali Pasha and the fact that the insurrection of 1821 was actually something of  an Albanian affair and that the Chios massacre was a consequence of this. The Chiotes had enormous privileges under the Ottomans even to the point of dominating the Ottoman admiralty. It was the role of the Chios 'navy' in the revolt that was seen as an act of treason by the Turks, though in Brewer's book the Chios navy was less than eager to join the fray and the cause of the Turkish invasion was the fact that the Samos navy has landed on the island and occupied the citadel.\nOn March 13th 1821, twelve days before the official beginning of the War of Independence, the first 'revolutionary flag' was actually raised on the island of  Spetses by Laskarina Bouboulina (though there were several revolutionary flags which could lay claim to being the first, including Hydra). Twice widowed with 7 children but extremely rich she owned several ships.  On April 3rd Spetses  revolted, followed by the islands of Hydra and Psara with a total of over 300 ships between them. Bouboulina and her fleet of 8 ships sailed to Nafplion and took part in the siege of the impregnable fortress there. Her later attack on Monemvasia managed to capture that fortress. She took part in the blockade of Pylos and brought supplies to the revolutionaries by sea. Bouboulina became a national hero, one of the first women to play a major role in a revolution. Without her and her ships the Greeks might not have gained their independence. What is less well known is that she was Albanian.\nThe Greeks, led by local heroes like Theodoros Kolokotronis from the Mani, capture the Peloponessos and form a provisional government, electing the Phanariot Alexandros Mavrokordatos president. On April 26th the Greeks attack Athens and the Turks of the city are forced to flee to the Acropolis. They are rescued in August by Turkish troops but finally surrender in June of 1822. By mid July, about half had been massacred, others died of disease, and over the next months the rest (550) were evacuated by foreign diplomats. In the meantime the Greeks in the Peloponessos, (or the Morea as it was called), are fighting amongst themselves. In  European cities intellectuals and poets like Lord Byron embrace the Greek cause and sway public opinion. The Greek struggle is interpreted by many Europeans simplistically and romantically as a battle between the ideals of the ancient Greeks against the ruthless Turks who had been occupying and suppressing the descendents of Pericles, Socrates and Plato. Many, including Lord Byron, volunteer to fight and become leaders and heroes of the revolution, known as the Philhellenes (friends of the Greeks). Some sing the praises of the modern Greeks but many are completely disillusioned by the pettiness and greed of the Greek klefth leaders who seem to just want glory and riches. Though some of these warlords are elevated to the role of saviors and heroes in the national mythology, the reality is that many of them were just pirates and thieves looking out for their own self-interest. On the other hand the motives of the Europeans is just as suspect and the plan for Greece was actually to be a sort of colony of Great Britain (or several colonies) since the last thing in the world they wanted was every national group on the continent being inspired by events in Greece and trying to start their own country too. But as history so often shows us, once you get the engine of revolution started you can't really control where it takes you.\nIn 1823 Lord Byron arrives in  Missolonghi, to take part in the resistance there, but dies three months later, not as romantically as he would have liked, but by disease. In 1826 the Peloponessos is back in Turkish hands and Athens is one of only a few cities controlled by the Greeks. When the Turkish army returns, a major battle takes place and on June 5th the Acropolis is surrendered. Among the fifteen hundred Greek dead are 22 of the 26 Philhellenes.  By 1827 the Turks have all of Greece with the exception of Nafplion and a few islands.\nBut the Greeks are rescued by their own history as support  for them in their struggle grows. The Treaty of London, backed by Britain, Russia and France. declares that the three great powers can intervene 'peacefully' to secure  the autonomy of the Hellenes. In October of that year the British, French and  Russians show the power of peaceful intervention when they destroy the Turkish-Egyptian  fleet in the bay of Navarino (Pylos) in what may have been the world's biggest  and most fatal 'misunderstanding'. Whether by accident or not, when an Egyptian  ship fires on a small boat filled with British sailors, all hell breaks  loose and when the smoke clears the entire Turkish-Egyptian fleet is at the  bottom of the bay, (where they can still be seen). It is  the most one-sided  battle in the history of naval warfare.   With the destruction of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet the Hellenes have a clear  path to nationhood except for the usual fighting amongst themselves.\nIn an interesting anecdote about the war, when the Turkish garrison of Athens was using the  acropolis as a fortress  they came under siege by the Greek revolutionary  army. After a few days, the Turks were short of ammunition and the Greeks  noticed from far away that they were taking down the marble columns and  extracting the lead wedge that holds the \"slices\" of the columns together. (If you have noticed some  fallen columns like at the temple of Olympian Zeus, you will see in the  center of the slices, a hollow part. This was filled with lead by the  ancient architects and made the columns stronger, and  able to resist the frequent  small earthquakes which happen all the time  around Attica.) The Greeks sent  an envoy to the Turks and asked them how much lead they would obtain by  taking down all the columns of the Parthenon. They agreed on the quantity of  the lead, and the Greeks sent it to the Turks with the agreement that they  would leave the remaining temple of the Parthenon intact. This shows how  much the Greek warriors who  could hardly read or write, appreciated  their ancient Greek heritage, though it didn't stop them  from taking the entire ancient library of Kaisariani Monastery  onto the Acropolis and tearing up the books to use the paper for  cartridges!\nIn 1828 Count Ioannis Capodistrias of  Corfu is elected the first governor of Greece by the  assembly of Troezene as the Turkish-Egyptian army leave the Peloponessos once  and for all. The Greeks draw up a constitution as a republic and  on March 31st 1833 the Turkish troops who have been occupying the  Acropolis leave. Four years after  being elected President, Kapodistrias is assassinated  in the new capital city of Nafplion supposedly by members of a Mani clan, the Mavromichalis family, who were at odds with his belief in a  strong central government, (though some people believe he was killed by the British who blamed the Mavromichalis and thus eliminated two problems).  A year later the 17 year old Otto (Othon), son of Ludwig of Bavaria, is declared  King of the Hellenes by the British, Russians and French. He arrives in Nafplion by boat  a year later to great fanfare. In 1834 the capital is moved to Athens, which  is now a  town of 10,000 inhabitants. In 1837 the University of Athens opens. King Otto is forced by the military  to accept a constitution in 1843. He  is overthrown by the army in 1862  and he and his wife Amalia are exiled and  replaced in 1863 by the Danish Prince Christian William Ferdinand Adolphus George  of the Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluckbsburg who becomes George I, King of the Hellenes.  In March of 1864 the Ionian islands are ceded to Greece by Great Britain.\nIn  1878 Great Britain takes over the administration of Cyprus from  the Ottoman government. Two  years later revolution breaks out in the still Turkish occupied island of Crete. In  1881 Thessaly and the Arta region of Epirus are ceded to Greece by the Ottoman  empire. From the mid-1880's to 90's Harilaos Trikoupis and Theodoror Deliyannis  alternate power, in what is the beginning of a two-party system.  Trikoupis focuses on domestic issues and during his rule roads are  built, tracks are laid, the metro is built and even the Corinth  Canal which had been started by  Nero in 67 AD is completed  in 1893. Deliyannis on the other hand is a believer in the Megalo Idea, that  Greece will one day rule a new Hellenic empire along the lines of  the Byzantine.\nDuring  the mid to late eighteen-hundreds, architects came from Europe to build a new Athens of neo-classical buildings  with the help of local architects and benefactors of the Hellenic diaspora society.  In 1842 a wealthy Greek from Trieste named Antonis Dimitriou had built  a house for himself in the center of Athens which in 1874 becomes  the Hotel  Grande Bretagne . It becomes the hotel of choice for kings, queens  and dignitaries and the scene of many important moments modern  Greek history. Some other examples include the Evangelismos Hospital built by Andrea Syngros from  the island of Chios, the Zappion which was a gift of the Zappas brothers from  Northern Epirus,  the Athens Polytechnic which was built by Nicholas Stournaras  from Metsovo and the King's  Palace (now the Parliament building in Syntagma). Perhaps the largest and most important gift is the reconstruction  of the ancient marble Panathenaic Stadium by George Averof, an Alexandrian businessman  from Metsovo for the Olympic games of 1896. By then the population of the city  is around 130,000 and the Olympics are a sort of coming-out party for the  new capital city of Europe's newest nation.\nBut the Olympics of 1896 which are credited as the first of the modern Olympics actually weren't. In 1833 Panagiotis Soutsos wrote about the revival of the Olympic Games in  his poetry 'Dialogue of the Dead' and in 1850 Dr William Penny Brookes founded annual games in Much Wenlock,  Shropshire, UK. In 1856 Evangelis Zappas wrote to King Otto of Greece offering to fund the  revival of the Olympic Games. The first modern international Olympic Games held in Athens at Platia Kotzia, then called Ludouvikou or Ludvig Square, in 1859, sponsored by Evangelis Zappas. The 'Zappas Games'  welcomed participants from the Ottoman Empire as well as Greece, making the Games  international. In 1860 Dr William Penny Brookes founded the Wenlock Olympian  Society. Brookes was clearly inspired by the first modern Olympic Games  since he incorporated some of the events into the Wenlock Olympian Games. Petros Velissariou was the first person to be listed on the honorary roll as the first Olympic victor for his performance in the 1859 Zappas Games. In 1863 Baron Pierre de Coubertin was born. Why is this mentioned? Coubertin is hailed as the founder of the modern Olympics and the Olympic Committee and yet when he was born both had already been in existence. In 1870, when Coubertin was just seven years old, the first modern Olympics to be held in a stadium took place in the ancient Panathenaic stadium of Athens which had been rebuilt by Evangelis Zappas. In 1875 the third games were held at the stadium and in 1889 another series of games was held in another location. It was not until 1892 that both Dr William Penny Brookes and Baron Pierre de Coubertin publicly  proposed the revival of the Olympic Games for the first time with Brooke's proposal coming first. In 1894 Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic  Committee.\nIn 1896 the Fourth modern international Olympic Games and the first IOC Olympic  Games were held at the Panathenian Stadium, in Athens, the stadium again having been refurbished by Zappas and fellow philanthropist George Averoff. The Zappeion building was the first indoor Olympic arena. So while you could argue that Coubertin was the founder of the International Olympic Committee, this line of reasoning falters when it comes to the modern Olympics which were inspired by Panayiotis Soutsos and paid for by Evangels Zappas approximately 1,460 years after the Ancient Olympic Games had been banned by the  first Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius I. (For more see www.zappas.org  where you can join the campaign to formally recognise Panagiotis Soutsos and Evangelis Zappas as founders of the  modern Olympic Games and Dr William Penny Brookes as a founder of the modern  Olympic Movement.)\nThe same year that the Olympics  are held another rebellion breaks out in Crete. Greece, under Deliyannis backs  the island's liberation and declares war on Turkey.  In three weeks the Greek army is defeated but Crete is put under international administration. In 1898 Crete is granted autonomy and Prince  George, the 2nd son of the King is appointed governor.\nIn Turkey events are taking place that will  change the face of Asia Minor and Greece too. Sultan Abdul Hamit of  the Ottoman Empire applies a policy of genocide to the Armenians. In August  and September 1894, Armenians are slain in Sassun. In October 1895   the first organised genocide takes place in Constantinople and Trebizond and in November and  December 1895 the Ottoman authorities organize a great massacre throughout the country.  In June 1896, the massacre of Van takes place. After the capture by the  Armenians of the Ottoman Bank, another massacre takes place in  Constantinople. The total number of victims is 300.000 Armenian men, women and  children.\nIn 1905 Eleftherios  Venizelos, the president of the Cretan assembly announces the Union  (enosis) with Greece. Though this union is not recognized until  1913, Venizelos comes to Athens where he becomes one of the most  important political players of 20th century Greece.\nHelp Support Matt's Greece Travel Guides \nDo you enjoy using my site?

Missolonghi was where the poet Lord Byron fighting with the Greeks had died ... International recognition of Greek independence ... Nationalism and Independence for Greece - World history Nationalism and Independence for Greece\nNationalism and \"Independence\" for the Greeks | Rebellion against Spain in  Latin America | Independence for Brazil\nNationalism and \"Independence\" for the  Greeks\nIf there is such a thing as being on the right side of history, those who supported maintenance of the status quo espoused by the Holy Alliance and traditionalist conservatives were not on it. There were too many people who wanted change. This included Greeks who wanted independence from Ottoman rule.\nThe Greeks had been under Ottoman rule     since the mid-1400s. In Greece, Islamic law applied only to Muslims. The Greek Orthodox     Church was allowed to function and Greeks were free to worship as they pleased and to     maintain their own culture and language. The Greeks saw the Ottoman Turks     as  inferior, and they looked back at what they considered the glories of     ancient Greece. In the late 1700s the French Revolution inspired among the Greeks a greater yearning     for liberty. A revolt against Ottoman rule gave Serbia quasi-autonomy beginning     in 1813, and this had encouraged the Greeks. There was a tendency among Greeks to     believe that it would be their fellow Orthodox Christians, the Russians,     who would free them from  Ottoman power. Then in 1814, at the center of a thriving     Greek community in Russian-ruled Odessa ,  Greek exiles laid what they hoped would be     the ground work for an armed uprising inside Greece, and they misleadingly portrayed      their group as having the approval of the Russian authorities.\nIn 1821, Greeks on the Peloponnese Peninsula rebelled,    inspired by news of an uprising in Moldavia, which was also under Ottoman rule. A small group led    by a Greek, which included some Russians, had crossed the border into Moldavia where they raised the flag of Greek independence and hoped that the Romanians    and Bulgarians of Moldavia would rise with them for their own independence.    The revolt in Moldavia was crushed, but  revolt in the  Peloponnese spread.\nRebels in the Peloponnese lacked good organization and discipline. For   the most part they were Christians smiting their enemies without mercy.  Leaders emerged who tried to invoke restraint and to stop looting, but they   had little effect. Greek peasants  armed with scythes, clubs and slings, grabbed what valuables   they could and killed wherever possible, including small clusters of Muslims   fleeing their homes. Of the estimated 50,000 Muslims living on the Peloponnese Peninsula in March 1821, an estimated 20,000 were killed within a few weeks – men, women   and children.\nIn Constantinople on April 10 the Ottoman sultan, Mahmud II, had the Greek   Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregorios V, seized. Gregorios was accused of having   intrigued with the uprising and having committed perjury and treason. Gregorios   was hanged with Mahmud believing it was his right to order the execution. Christians   across Europe were aware of the uprising in the Peloponnese but not of the atrocities   of the revolutionaries, and they were shocked by the hanging of Gregorios. Common   Russians wanted to avenge the death of the patriarch, but Russia's  Tsar Alexander had other   matters to consider and merely withdrew his ambassador from Constantinople.    Alexander was still allied with Austria against revolutions, especially   nationalist revolutions, and the tsar was not ready to break with that alliance.   And neither was Britain's foreign secretary Lord Castlereagh.\nIn April the Greek revolt  spread  northward toward central Greece and Athens . In May, Muslims in Athens   were defending themselves from the Acropolis. In the Peloponnese various towns   and cities fell, including Petras, where all Muslims who did not make it to   the safety of the walls of the town's fortress were killed. In August in the   Peloponnese, Muslims of the small town of Monemvasia were besieged and chose   to surrender rather than endure more hunger, and when they surrendered they were   slaughtered. A few days later, between 2,000 and 3,000 Muslims in Navarino were   massacred. Tripolitsa was a city of 35,000 Turks, Albanians, Jews and others in the middle of Peloponnese. There the Ottoman governor resided, and there Greeks massacred for two days.   An estimated 10,000 people, including women and children, were killed, as were   2,000 who had been taken prisoner. It is reported that Muslim women were raped   and that Muslims were tortured for information of the whereabouts of their money.   Water wells became polluted and disease spread that caused the death of thousands   of Greeks. The taking of Tripolitsa in October was the final Greek success for   the year 1821. Turks remained only at the fortresses in Patras and Nauplia and   two lesser fortresses.\nMeanwhile in Constantinople, Janissaries soldiers    were in revolt against the sultan and venting their anger upon Christians, and Christians were being slaughtered. The   sultan transported soldiers from Anatolia and defeated the insurgents, killing   200 Janissaries. In early 1822, Muslims struck again against Christians. A Turkish   military force joined by crowds of impassioned civilians landed on the island   of Chios in the eastern Aegean Sea, an island with a population of about 100,000.   There were Turkish officers who tried to restrain sections of the invading force.   Nevertheless the invaders slaughtered around 25,000, some of the Greeks escaping   by boats that came to their rescue, and some wealthy islanders paid Turkish commanders   huge sums for protection. The slaughter stopped when Turks rounded up Greek   survivors for sale in the slave markets of Asia Minor.\nThe Greeks had the advantage of superiority at sea. They were experienced   mariners. Greek sailors who had been working on Ottoman ships abandoned   those ships, leaving the Turks to recruit inexperienced dock-laborers and peasants.  In 1822 the Greeks captured the coastal   region in the west just north of the  Peloponnese Peninsula,   and farther east they took Athens and Thebes. The Greeks were now in control   of west and east-central Greece as well as  the Aegean islands.\nIn 1822 the Greeks declared independence, stating:\nWe, descendants of the wise and noble peoples of Hellas, we who are the    contemporaries of the enlightened and civilized nations of Europe, we who    behold the advantages which they enjoy under the protection of the impenetrable    aegis of the law, find it no longer possible to suffer without cowardice and    self-contempt the cruel yoke of the Ottoman power which has weighed upon    us for more than four centuries – a power which does not listen to reason    and knows no other law than its own will, which orders and disposes everything    despotically and according to caprice.\nThe military victories of the Greeks led them to underrate the importance   of discipline and to ignore the advice of those who preferred victory accompanied   by restraint and mercy. The lack of a central organization for the revolution    produced three provisional Greek governments. In  1823, rivalries escalated   into violence. Greeks on the Aegean island of Psara were at war with those of   the larger island of Samos about 120 kilometers (75 miles) to the south. Discipline   and cohesion vanished from the Greek fleet.\nBattle of Navarino Bay, the last   battle of sailing ships, 1827\nClick to enlarge\nA new Ottoman admiral lacked confidence     and failed to regain command of the sea for the Turks. In 1824 fighting between     Greeks increased. On the Peloponnese Peninsula  were Greek notables who wanted to     retain the status they had held during Ottoman rule, and there were leading     fighters who wanted some political power as a reward for their military contribution.     Ship owners also thought they deserved some political power. Liberal intellectuals     wanted a parliament. There were conservatives who tended to see the struggle     between the Ottoman Turks and the Greeks as between Islam and Greek Orthodox     Christianity, and they tended to want the preservation of an authoritarian relationship     between the Greek Orthodox Church and Greek society. \nWhile these divisions were taking place, Mahmud II was strengthening his   position through an alliance with his independent-minded governor of Egypt,   Muhammad Ali, and his son Ibrahim. Ali had  newly modernized armed forces and   a relatively large navy. Sultan Mahud promised Muhammad Ali rule over the island   of Crete and the appointment of Ibrahim as pasha of the Peloponnese, and Mahmud   promised Ali concessions in Syria. The Egyptians, under the command of Ibrahim,   arrived in Greece in 1825 and quickly gained dominance of the seas and Aegean   islands. The Ottomans retook Athens, the Peloponnese and the town of Missolonghi just north of the Peloponnese – while rival Greek presidents and rival assemblies were competing for political   supremacy.\nKing Otto\nMissolonghi was where the poet Lord Byron fighting with the Greeks had died in 1824 because of a disease. Missolonghi  was a symbol of Greek defiance against Ottoman power. It held   out for months, heroically in the eyes of the Europeans. Its fall to the Muslims   added to a new wave of support for the Greeks across Europe, with the idea that   Greece had to be saved for European civilization. Already, financiers in London   had contracted loans for the Greeks. The Greek effort was helped by the arrival   of money and volunteers from abroad, bringing the complaint from the Turks that   they were \"no longer fighting the Greeks but all Europe.\"\nIbrahim began more devastation in Greece, and by July 1827 it looked as though    the Ottoman Empire had won its war against the Greek insurgency. This was claimed    by Ottoman writers. But Ibrahim's devastations inspired Britain, France and    Russia to a joint demonstration by their navies. They demanded an armistice    and that Ibrahim evacuate the Peloponnese. Ibrahim refused. In October the British,    French and Russian fleet entered Navarino Bay , and    there the Battle of Navarino, last naval battle of sailing ships, took place.    Ibrahim's navy was destroyed.\nKing Otto arrives in Greece, 1833,    an artist's imagination\nIn  October  1828, France landed troops on the Peloponnese Peninsula, and   under French protection the Greeks regrouped and formed a new government. The   Greeks took back Athens, Thebes and other territory, and the European powers   imposed a ceasefire. In Greece a republican government war formed, with John   Capdistrias as its leader. His authoritarian style of governing offended many,   and in 1831 he was assassinated. \nInternational recognition of Greek independence came in 1832 in a treaty   signed by Britain, France, Russia and Bavaria. Athens was recognized as the   capital of Greece. Thessaly, Macedon, Thrace and Epirus, which had large populations   of non-Greeks, were not recognized as a part of Greece. Crete, the Dodecanese   islands and the region around Smyrna were not included in the new Greek state. The convening European powers retained an ill-defined right to intervene in Greece. And     they  wanted the Greeks to be ruled by a monarchy.     They chose the seventeen-year-old son of Ludwig I of Bavaria, Otto of Wittlesbach,      and Otto  became King Otto of Greece.\nUnder King Otto the Greeks were taxed more than they had been under the Ottoman    Turks. This did not please the Greeks. Neither did King Otto's Roman Catholicism.     Orthodox Greeks  considered him a heretic. And rather than marry into a    Greek family, Otto, in 1837, married a princess from Oldenburg Germany, where    his wedding took place. The queen remained unpopular with the Greeks, while    the Great Powers continued to guarantee King Otto's rule.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nTagore and His India. by ... in the fight against ... nonsectarian fighter for Indian independence. 24 But their ways would have parted when ... Tagore and His India - Nobel Prize Tagore and His India\nTagore and His India\nby Amartya Sen *\nVoice of Bengal\nRabindranath Tagore,   who died in 1941 at the age of eighty, is a towering figure in   the millennium-old literature of Bengal. Anyone who becomes   familiar with this large and flourishing tradition will be   impressed by the power of Tagore's presence in Bangladesh and in   India. His poetry as well as his novels, short stories, and   essays are very widely read, and the songs he composed   reverberate around the eastern part of India and throughout Bangladesh.\nIn contrast, in the rest of the world,   especially in Europe and America, the excitement that Tagore's   writings created in the early years of the twentieth century has   largely vanished. The enthusiasm with which his work was once   greeted was quite remarkable. Gitanjali, a selection of   his poetry for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature   in 1913, was published in English translation in London in March   of that year, and had been reprinted ten times by November, when   the award was announced. But he is not much read now in the West,   and already by 1937, Graham Greene was able to say: \"As for   Rabindranath Tagore, I cannot believe that anyone but Mr. Yeats can still   take his poems very seriously.\"\nThe Mystic\nThe contrast between Tagore's commanding   presence in Bengali literature and culture, and his near-total eclipse in the rest of the world, is perhaps less interesting   than the distinction between the view of Tagore as a deeply   relevant and many-sided contemporary thinker in Bangladesh and   India, and his image in the West as a repetitive and remote   spiritualist. Graham Greene had, in fact, gone on to explain that   he associated Tagore \"with what Chesterton calls 'the bright   pebbly eyes' of the Theosophists.\" Certainly, an air of mysticism   played some part in the \"selling\" of Rabindranath Tagore to the   West by Yeats, Ezra Pound, and his other early champions. Even   Anna Akhmatova, one of Tagore's few later admirers (who   translated his poems into Russian in the mid-1960s), talks of   \"that mighty flow of poetry which takes its strength from   Hinduism as from the Ganges, and is called Rabindranath Tagore.\"\nAn air of mysticism.\nPortrait by W. Rothenstein\nConfluence of Cultures\nRabindranath did come from a Hindu   family - one of the landed gentry who owned estates mostly in   what is now Bangladesh. But whatever wisdom there might be in   Akhmatova's invoking of Hinduism and the Ganges, it did not   prevent the largely Muslim citizens of Bangladesh from having a   deep sense of identity with Tagore and his ideas. Nor did it stop   the newly independent Bangladesh from choosing one of Tagore's   songs - the \"Amar Sonar Bangla\" which means \"my golden   Bengal\" - as its national anthem. This must be very confusing   to those who see the contemporary world as a \"clash of   civilizations\" - with \"the Muslim civilization,\" \"the Hindu   civilization,\" and \"the Western civilization,\" each forcefully   confronting the others. They would also be confused by   Rabindranath Tagore's own description of his Bengali family as   the product of \"a confluence of three cultures: Hindu, Mohammedan, and British\". 1\nRabindranath's grandfather, Dwarkanath, was   well known for his command of Arabic and Persian, and   Rabindranath grew up in a family atmosphere in which a deep   knowledge of Sanskrit and ancient Hindu texts was combined with   an understanding of Islamic traditions as well as Persian   literature. It is not so much that Rabindranath tried to   produce - or had an interest in producing - a \"synthesis\"   of the different religions (as the great Moghul emperor Akbar   tried hard to achieve) as that his outlook was persistently   non-sectarian, and his writings - some two hundred   books - show the influence of different parts of the Indian   cultural background as well as of the rest of the world. 2\nAbode of Peace\nMost of his work was written at   Santiniketan (Abode of Peace), the small town that grew around   the school he founded in Bengal in 1901, and he not only   conceived there an imaginative and innovative system of   education, but through his writings and his influence on students   and teachers, he was able to use the school as a base from which   he could take a major part in India's social, political, and cultural movements.\nThe profoundly original writer, whose   elegant prose and magical poetry Bengali readers know well, is   not the sermonizing spiritual guru admired - and then   rejected - in London. Tagore was not only an immensely   versatile poet; he was also a great short story writer, novelist,   playwright, essayist, and composer of songs, as well as a   talented painter whose pictures, with their mixture of   representation and abstraction, are only now beginning to receive   the acclaim that they have long deserved. His essays, moreover,   ranged over literature, politics, culture, social change,   religious beliefs, philosophical analysis, international   relations, and much else. The coincidence of the fiftieth   anniversary of Indian independence with the publication of a   selection of Tagore's letters by Cambridge University Press 3 , brought Tagore's ideas and   reflections to the fore, which makes it important to examine what   kind of leadership in thought and understanding he provided in   the Indian subcontinent in the first half of this century.\nGandhi and Tagore\nSince Rabindranath Tagore and Mohandas   Gandhi were two leading Indian thinkers in the twentieth century,   many commentators have tried to compare their ideas. On learning   of Rabindranath's death, Jawaharlal Nehru, then incarcerated in a   British jail in India, wrote in his prison diary for August 7, 1941:\n\"Gandhi and Tagore. Two types entirely     different from each other, and yet both of them typical of     India, both in the long line of India's great men ... It is not     so much because of any single virtue but because of the tout     ensemble, that I felt that among the world's great men     today Gandhi and Tagore were supreme as human beings. What good     fortune for me to have come into close contact with     them.\"\nRomain Rolland was   fascinated by the contrast between them, and when he completed   his book on Gandhi, he wrote to an Indian academic, in March   1923: \"I have finished my Gandhi, in which I pay tribute   to your two great river-like souls, overflowing with divine   spirit, Tagore and Gandhi.\" The following month, he recorded in   his diary an account of some of the differences between Gandhi   and Tagore written by Reverend C.F. Andrews, the English   clergyman and public activist who was a close friend of both men   (and whose important role in Gandhi's life in South Africa as   well as India is well portrayed in Richard Attenborough's film   Gandhi [1982]). Andrews described to Rolland a discussion between   Tagore and Gandhi, at which he was present, on subjects that   divided them:\n\"The first subject of discussion was idols;     Gandhi defended them, believing the masses incapable of raising     themselves immediately to abstract ideas. Tagore cannot bear to     see the people eternally treated as a child. Gandhi quoted the     great things achieved in Europe by the flag as an idol; Tagore     found it easy to object, but Gandhi held his ground,     contrasting European flags bearing eagles, etc., with his own,     on which he has put a spinning wheel. The second point of     discussion was nationalism, which Gandhi defended. He said that     one must go through nationalism to reach internationalism, in     the same way that one must go through war to reach     peace.\" 4\nTagore greatly admired Gandhi but he had   many disagreements with him on a variety of subjects, including   nationalism, patriotism, the importance of cultural exchange, the   role of rationality and of science, and the nature of economic   and social development. These differences, I shall argue, have a   clear and consistent pattern, with Tagore pressing for more room   for reasoning, and for a less traditionalist view, a greater   interest in the rest of the world, and more respect for science   and for objectivity generally.\nRabindranath knew that he could not have   given India the political leadership that Gandhi provided, and he   was never stingy in his praise for what Gandhi did for the nation   (it was, in fact, Tagore who popularized the term   \"Mahatma\" - great soul - as a description of Gandhi). And   yet each remained deeply critical of many things that the other   stood for. That Mahatma Gandhi has received incomparably more   attention outside India and also within much of India itself   makes it important to understand \"Tagore's side\" of the   Gandhi-Tagore debates.\nIn his prison diary, Nehru wrote: \"Perhaps   it is as well that [Tagore] died now and did not see the many   horrors that are likely to descend in increasing measure on the world and on India. He had seen enough and he was infinitely sad   and unhappy.\" Toward the end of his life, Tagore was indeed   becoming discouraged about the state of India, especially as its   normal burden of problems, such as hunger and poverty, was being   supplemented by politically organized incitement to \"communal\"   violence between Hindus and Muslims. This conflict would lead in   1947, six years after Tagore's death, to the widespread killing   that took place during partition; but there was much gore already   during his declining days. In December 1939, he wrote to his   friend Leonard Elmhirst, the English philanthropist and social   reformer who had worked closely with him on rural reconstruction   in India (and who had gone on to found the Dartington Hall Trust   in England and a progressive school at Dartington that explicitly   invoked Rabindranath's educational ideals): 5\n\"It does not need a defeatist to feel deeply anxious about the       future of millions who, with all their innate culture and their       peaceful traditions are being simultaneously subjected to       hunger, disease, exploitations foreign and indigenous, and the       seething discontents of communalism.\"\nHow would Tagore have viewed the India of   today? Would he see progress there, or wasted opportunity,   perhaps even a betrayal of its promise and conviction? And, on a   wider subject, how would he react to the spread of cultural   separatism in the contemporary world?\nEast and West\nGiven the vast range of his creative   achievements, perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the image of   Tagore in the West is its narrowness; he is recurrently viewed as   \"the great mystic from the East,\" an image with a putative   message for the West, which some would welcome, others dislike,   and still others find deeply boring. To a great extent this   Tagore was the West's own creation, part of its tradition of   message-seeking from the East, particularly from India,   which - as Hegel put it - had \"existed for millennia in   the imagination of the Europeans.\" 6 Friedrich Schlegel, Schelling, Herder, and Schopenhauer were only   a few of the thinkers who followed the same pattern. They   theorized, at first, that India was the source of superior   wisdom. Schopenhauer at one stage even argued that the New   Testament \"must somehow be of Indian origin: this is attested by   its completely Indian ethics, which transforms morals into   asceticism, its pessimism, and its avatar,\" in \"the person of   Christ.\" But then they rejected their own theories with great   vehemence, sometimes blaming India for not living up to their unfounded expectations.\nWe can imagine that Rabindranath's physical   appearance - handsome, bearded, dressed in non-Western   clothes - may, to some extent, have encouraged his being seen   as a carrier of exotic wisdom. Yasunari Kawabata ,   the first Japanese Nobel Laureate in Literature, treasured   memories from his middle-school days of \"this sage-like   poet\":\nHis white hair flowed softly down both     sides of his forehead; the tufts of hair under the temples also     were long like two beards, and linking up with the hair on his     cheeks, continued into his beard, so that he gave an     impression, to the boy I was then, of some ancient Oriental     wizard. 7\nThat appearance would have been well-suited   to the selling of Tagore in the West as a quintessentially   mystical poet, and it could have made it somewhat easier to   pigeonhole him. Commenting on Rabindranath's appearance, Frances   Cornford told William Rothenstein, \"I can now imagine a powerful   and gentle Christ, which I never could before.\" Beatrice Webb,   who did not like Tagore and resented what she took to be his   \"quite obvious dislike of all that the Webbs stand for\" (there   is, in fact, little evidence that Tagore had given much thought   to this subject), said that he was \"beautiful to look at\" and   that \"his speech has the perfect intonation and slow chant-like   moderation of the dramatic saint.\" Ezra Pound and W. B. Yeats,   among others, first led the chorus of adoration in the Western   appreciation of Tagore, and then soon moved to neglect and even   shrill criticism. The contrast between Yeats's praise of his work   in 1912 (\"These lyrics ... display in their thought a world I   have dreamed of all my life long,\" \"the work of a supreme   culture\") and his denunciation in 1935 (\"Damn Tagore\") arose   partly from the inability of Tagore's many-sided writings to fit   into the narrow box in which Yeats wanted to place - and   keep - him. Certainly, Tagore did write a huge amount, and   published ceaselessly, even in English (sometimes in indifferent   English translation), but Yeats was also bothered, it is clear,   by the difficulty of fitting Tagore's later writings into the   image Yeats had presented to the West. Tagore, he had said, was   the product of \"a whole people, a whole civilization,   immeasurably strange to us,\" and yet \"we have met our own   image, ... or heard, perhaps for the first time in literature,   our voice as in a dream.\" 8\nYeats did not totally reject his early   admiration (as Ezra Pound and several others did), and he   included some of Tagore's early poems in The Oxford Book of   Modern Verse, which he edited in 1936. Yeats also had some   favorable things to say about Tagore's prose writings. His   censure of Tagore's later poems was reinforced by his dislike of   Tagore's own English translations of his work (\"Tagore does not   know English, no Indian knows English,\" Yeats explained), unlike   the English version of Gitanjali which Yeats had himself   helped to prepare. Poetry is, of course, notoriously difficult to   translate, and anyone who knows Tagore's poems in their original   Bengali cannot feel satisfied with any of the translations (made   with or without Yeats's help). Even the translations of his prose   works suffer, to some extent, from distortion. E.M. Forster   noted, in a review of a translation of one of Tagore's great   Bengali novels, The Home and the World, in 1919: \"The   theme is so beautiful,\" but the charms have \"vanished in   translation,\" or perhaps \"in an experiment that has not quite   come off.\" 9\nTagore himself played a somewhat bemused   part in the boom and bust of his English reputation. He accepted   the extravagant praise with much surprise as well as pleasure,   and then received denunciations with even greater surprise, and   barely concealed pain. Tagore was sensitive to criticism, and was   hurt by even the most far-fetched accusations, such as the charge   that he was getting credit for the work of Yeats, who had   \"rewritten\" Gitanjali. (This charge was made by a correspondent   for The Times, Sir Valentine Chirol, whom E.M. Forster once   described as \"an old Anglo-Indian reactionary hack.\") From time   to time Tagore also protested the crudity of some of his   overexcited advocates. He wrote to C.F. Andrews in 1920: \"These   people ... are like drunkards who are afraid of their lucid   intervals.\"\nGod and Others\nYeats was not wrong to see a large   religious element in Tagore's writings. He certainly had   interesting and arresting things to say about life and death.   Susan Owen, the mother of Wilfred Owen, wrote to Rabindranath in   1920, describing her last conversations with her son before he   left for the war which would take his life. Wilfred said goodbye   with \"those wonderful words of yours - beginning at 'When I   go from hence, let this be my parting word.'\" When Wilfred's   pocket notebook was returned to his mother, she found \"these   words written in his dear writing - with your name beneath.\"\nThe idea of a direct, joyful, and totally   fearless relationship with God can be found in many of Tagore's   religious writings, including the poems of Gitanjali. From   India's diverse religious traditions he drew many ideas, both   from ancient texts and from popular poetry. But \"the bright   pebbly eyes of the Theosophists\" do not stare out of his verses.   Despite the archaic language of the original translation of Gitanjali, which did not, I believe, help to preserve the   simplicity of the original, its elementary humanity comes through   more clearly than any complex and intense spirituality:\nLeave this chanting and singing and telling     of beads! Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of     a temple with doors all shut?\nOpen thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee!\nHe is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and     where the pathmaker is breaking stones.\nHe is with them in sun and in shower, and his garment is     covered with dust.\nAn ambiguity about religious experience is   central to many of Tagore's devotional poems, and makes them   appeal to readers irrespective of their beliefs; but excessively   detailed interpretation can ruinously strip away that   ambiguity. 10 This applies   particularly to his many poems which combine images of human love   and those of pious devotion. Tagore writes:\nI have no sleep to-night. Ever and again I     open my door and look out on the darkness, my friend!\nI can see nothing before me. I wonder where lies thy     path!\nBy what dim shore of the ink-black river, by what far edge of     the frowning forest, through what mazy depth of gloom, art thou     threading thy course to come to see me, my friend?\nI suppose it could be helpful to be told,   as Yeats hastens to explain, that \"the servant or the bride   awaiting the master's home-coming in the empty house\" is \"among   the images of the heart turning to God.\" But in Yeats's   considerate attempt to make sure that the reader does not miss   the \"main point,\" something of the enigmatic beauty of the   Bengali poem is lost - even what had survived the antiquated   language of the English translation. Tagore certainly had   strongly held religious beliefs (of an unusually   nondenominational kind), but he was interested in a great many   other things as well and had many different things to say about   them.\nSome of the ideas he tried to present were   directly political, and they figure rather prominently in his   letters and lectures. He had practical, plainly expressed views   about nationalism, war and peace, cross-cultural education,   freedom of the mind, the importance of rational criticism, the   need for openness, and so on. His admirers in the West, however,   were tuned to the more otherworldly themes which had been   emphasized by his first Western patrons. People came to his   public lectures in Europe and America, expecting ruminations on   grand, transcendental themes; when they heard instead his views   on the way public leaders should behave, there was some   resentment, particularly (as E.P. Thompson reports) when he   delivered political criticism \"at $700 a scold.\"\nAn ambiguity about religious       experience.\nThe Royal Library\nReasoning in Freedom\nFor Tagore it was of the highest importance   that people be able to live, and reason, in freedom. His   attitudes toward politics and culture, nationalism and   internationalism, tradition and modernity, can all be seen in the   light of this belief. 11 Nothing,   perhaps, expresses his values as clearly as a poem in Gitanjali:\nWhere the mind is without fear\nand the head is held high;\nWhere knowledge is free;\nWhere the clear stream of reason\nhas not lost its way into the\ndreary desert sand of dead habit; ...\nInto that heaven of freedom,\nmy Father, let my country awake.\nRabindranath's qualified support for   nationalist movements - and his opposition to the unfreedom   of alien rule - came from this commitment. So did his   reservations about patriotism, which, he argued, can limit both   the freedom to engage ideas from outside \"narrow domestic walls\"   and the freedom also to support the causes of people in other   countries. Rabindranath's passion for freedom underlies his firm   opposition to unreasoned traditionalism, which makes one a   prisoner of the past (lost, as he put it, in \"the dreary desert   sand of dead habit\").\nTagore illustrates the tyranny of the past   in his amusing yet deeply serious parable \"Kartar Bhoot\" (\"The   Ghost of the Leader\"). As the respected leader of an imaginary   land is about to die, his panic-stricken followers request him to   stay on after his death to instruct them on what to do. He   consents. But his followers find their lives are full of rituals   and constraints on everyday behavior and are not responsive to   the world around them. Ultimately, they request the ghost of the   leader to relieve them of his domination, when he informs them   that he exists only in their minds.\nTagore's deep aversion to any commitment to   the past that could not be modified by contemporary reason   extended even to the alleged virtue of invariably keeping past   promises. On one occasion when Mahatma Gandhi visited Tagore's   school at Santiniketan, a young woman got him to sign her   autograph book. Gandhi wrote: \"Never make a promise in haste.   Having once made it fulfill it at the cost of your life.\" When he   saw this entry, Tagore became agitated. He wrote in the same book   a short poem in Bengali to the effect that no one can be made \"a   prisoner forever with a chain of clay.\" He went on to conclude in   English, possibly so that Gandhi could read it too, \"Fling away   your promise if it is found to be wrong.\" 12\nTagore and Gandhi, in Shantiniketan,       1940.\nShantiniketan Collections\nTagore had the greatest admiration for   Mahatma Gandhi as a person and as a political leader, but he was   also highly skeptical of Gandhi's form of nationalism and his   conservative instincts regarding the country's past traditions.   He never criticized Gandhi personally. In the 1938 essay, \"Gandhi   the Man,\" he wrote:\nGreat as he is as a politician, as an     organizer, as a leader of men, as a moral reformer, he is     greater than all these as a man, because none of these aspects     and activities limits his humanity. They are rather inspired     and sustained by it.\nAnd yet there is a deep division between   the two men. Tagore was explicit about his disagreement:\nWe who often glorify our tendency to ignore     reason, installing in its place blind faith, valuing it as     spiritual, are ever paying for its cost with the obscuration of     our mind and destiny. I blamed Mahatmaji for exploiting this     irrational force of credulity in our people, which might have     had a quick result [in creating] a superstructure, while     sapping the foundation. Thus began my estimate of Mahatmaji, as     the guide of our nation, and it is fortunate for me that it did     not end there.\nBut while it \"did not end there,\" that   difference of vision was a powerful divider. Tagore, for example,   remained unconvinced of the merit of Gandhi's forceful advocacy   that everyone should spin at home with the \"charka,\" the   primitive spinning wheel. For Gandhi this practice was an   important part of India's self-realization. \"The spinning-wheel   gradually became,\" as his biographer B.R. Nanda writes, \"the   center of rural uplift in the Gandhian scheme of Indian   economics.\" 13 Tagore found the   alleged economic rationale for this scheme quite unrealistic. As   Romain Rolland noted, Rabindranath \"never tires of criticizing   the charka.\" In this economic judgment, Tagore was probably   right. Except for the rather small specialized market for   high-quality spun cloth, it is hard to make economic sense of   hand-spinning, even with wheels less primitive than Gandhi's   charka. Hand-spinning as a widespread activity can survive only   with the help of heavy government subsidies. 14 However, Gandhi's advocacy of the charka was   not based only on economics. He wanted everyone to spin for   \"thirty minutes every day as a sacrifice,\" seeing this as a way   for people who are better off to identify themselves with the   less fortunate. He was impatient with Tagore's refusal to grasp   this point:\nThe poet lives for the morrow, and would     have us do likewise .... \"Why should I, who have no need to     work for food, spin?\" may be the question asked. Because I am     eating what does not belong to me. I am living on the     spoliation of my countrymen. Trace the source of every coin     that finds its way into your pocket, and you will realise the     truth of what I write. Every one must spin. Let Tagore spin     like the others. Let him burn his foreign clothes; that is the     duty today. God will take care of the morrow. 15\nIf Tagore had missed something in Gandhi's   argument, so did Gandhi miss the point of Tagore's main   criticism. It was not only that the charka made little economic   sense, but also, Tagore thought, that it was not the way to make   people reflect on anything: \"The charka does not require anyone   to think; one simply turns the wheel of the antiquated invention   endlessly, using the minimum of judgment and stamina.\"\nCelibacy and Personal Life\nTagore and Gandhi's attitudes toward   personal life were also quite different. Gandhi was keen on the   virtues of celibacy, theorized about it, and, after some years of   conjugal life, made a private commitment - publicly   announced - to refrain from sleeping with his wife.   Rabindranath's own attitude on this subject was very different, but he was gentle about their disagreements:\n[Gandhiji] condemns sexual life as     inconsistent with the moral progress of man, and has a horror     of sex as great as that of the author of The Kreutzer     Sonata, but, unlike Tolstoy, he betrays no abhorrence of     the sex that tempts his kind. In fact, his tenderness for women     is one of the noblest and most consistent traits of his     character, and he counts among the women of his country some of     his best and truest comrades in the great movement he is     leading.\nTagore's personal life was, in many ways,   an unhappy one. He married in 1883, lost his wife in 1902, and   never remarried. He sought close companionship, which he did not   always get (perhaps even during his married life - he wrote   to his wife, Mrinalini: \"If you and I could be comrades in all   our work and in all our thoughts it would be splendid, but we   cannot attain all that we desire\"). He maintained a warm   friendship with, and a strong Platonic attachment to, the   literature-loving wife, Kadambari, of his elder brother,   Jyotirindranath. He dedicated some poems to her before his   marriage, and several books afterward, some after her death (she   committed suicide, for reasons that are not fully understood, at   the age of twenty-five, four months after Rabindranath's   wedding). Much later in life, during his tour of Argentina in   1924-1925, Rabindranath came to know the talented and beautiful   Victoria Ocampo, who later became the publisher of the literary   magazine Sur. They became close friends, but it appears   that Rabindranath deflected the possibility of a passionate   relationship into a confined intellectual one. 16 His friend Leonard Elmhirst, who accompanied   Rabindranath on his Argentine tour, wrote:\nBesides having a keen intellectual       understanding of his books, she was in love with him - but       instead of being content to build a friendship on the basis of       intellect, she was in a hurry to establish that kind of       proprietary right over him which he absolutely would not       brook.\nOcampo and Elmhirst, while remaining   friendly, were both quite rude in what they wrote about each   other. Ocampo's book on Tagore (of which a Bengali translation   was made from the Spanish by the distinguished poet and critic   Shankha Ghosh) is primarily concerned with Tagore's writings but   also discusses the pleasures and difficulties of their   relationship, giving quite a different account from Elmhirst's,   and never suggesting any sort of proprietary intentions.\nVictoria Ocampo, however, makes it clear   that she very much wanted to get physically closer to   Rabindranath: \"Little by little he [Tagore] partially tamed the   young animal, by turns wild and docile, who did not sleep,   dog-like, on the floor outside his door, simply because it was   not done.\" 17 Rabindranath, too, was   clearly very much attracted to her. He called her \"Vijaya\" (the   Sanskrit equivalent of Victoria), dedicated a book of poems to   her, Purabi - an \"evening melody,\" and expressed great   admiration for her mind (\"like a star that was distant\"). In a   letter to her he wrote, as if to explain his own reticence:\nWhen we were together, we mostly played     with words and tried to laugh away our best opportunities to     see each other clearly ... Whenever there is the least sign of     the nest becoming a jealous rival of the sky [,] my mind, like     a migrant bird, tries to take ... flight to a distant     shore.\nFive years later, during Tagore's European   tour in 1930, he sent her a cable: \"Will you not come and see   me.\" She did. But their relationship did not seem to go much   beyond conversation, and their somewhat ambiguous correspondence   continued over the years. Written in 1940, a year before his   death at eighty, one of the poems in Sesh Lekha (\"Last   Writings\"), seems to be about her: \"How I wish I could once again   find my way to that foreign land where waits for me the message   of love!/... Her language I knew not, but what her eyes said   will forever remain eloquent in its anguish.\" 18 However indecisive, or confused, or awkward   Rabindranath may have been, he certainly did not share Mahatma   Gandhi's censorious views of sex. In fact, when it came to social   policy, he advocated contraception and family planning while   Gandhi preferred abstinence.\nTagore with his wife Mrinalini Devi         in 1883.\nShantiniketan Collections\nScience and the People\nGandhi and Tagore severely clashed over   their totally different attitudes toward science. In January   1934, Bihar was struck by a devastating earthquake, which killed   thousands of people. Gandhi, who was then deeply involved in the   fight against untouchability (the barbaric system inherited from   India's divisive past, in which \"lowly people\" were kept at a   physical distance), extracted a positive lesson from the tragic   event. \"A man like me,\" Gandhi argued, \"cannot but believe this   earthquake is a divine chastisement sent by God for our sins\"    -  in particular the sins of untouchability. \"For me there is a vital connection between the Bihar calamity and the untouchability campaign.\"\nTagore, who equally abhorred untouchability   and had joined Gandhi in the movements against it, protested   against this interpretation of an event that had caused suffering   and death to so many innocent people, including children and   babies. He also hated the epistemology implicit in seeing an   earthquake as caused by ethical failure. \"It is,\" he wrote, \"all   the more unfortunate because this kind of unscientific view of   [natural] phenomena is too readily accepted by a large section of   our countrymen.\"\nThe two remained deeply divided over their   attitudes toward science. However, while Tagore believed that   modern science was essential to the understanding of physical   phenomena, his views on epistemology were interestingly   heterodox. He did not take the simple \"realist\" position often   associated with modern science. The report of his conversation   with Einstein, published in The New York Times in 1930, shows how   insistent Tagore was on interpreting truth through observation   and reflective concepts. To assert that something is true or   untrue in the absence of anyone to observe or perceive its truth,   or to form a conception of what it is, appeared to Tagore to be   deeply questionable. When Einstein remarked, \"If there were no   human beings any more, the Apollo Belvedere no longer would be   beautiful?\" Tagore simply replied, \"No.\" Going further - and   into much more interesting territory - Einstein said, \"I   agree with regard to this conception of beauty, but not with   regard to truth.\" Tagore's response was: \"Why not? Truth is   realized through men.\" 19\nAlbert Einstein and Tagore, in New York,       1930.\nPhoto: Martin Vos/Rabindra Bhavan,       Shantiniketan\nTagore's epistemology, which he never   pursued systematically, would seem to be searching for a line of   reasoning that would later be elegantly developed by Hilary   Putnam, who has argued: \"Truth depends on conceptual schemes and   it is nonetheless 'real truth.'\" 20 Tagore himself said little to explain his convictions, but it is   important to take account of his heterodoxy, not only because his   speculations were invariably interesting, but also because they   illustrate how his support for any position, including his strong   interest in science, was accompanied by critical scrutiny.\nNationalism and Colonialism\nTagore was predictably hostile to communal   sectarianism (such as a Hindu orthodoxy that was antagonistic to   Islamic, Christian, or Sikh perspectives). But even nationalism   seemed to him to be suspect. Isaiah Berlin summarizes well Tagore's complex position on Indian nationalism:\nTagore stood fast on the narrow causeway,     and did not betray his vision of the difficult truth. He     condemned romantic overattachment to the past, what he called     the tying of India to the past \"like a sacrificial goat     tethered to a post,\" and he accused men who displayed it - they     seemed to him reactionary - of not knowing what true political     freedom was, pointing out that it is from English thinkers and     English books that the very notion of political liberty was     derived. But against cosmopolitanism he maintained that the     English stood on their own feet, and so must Indians. In 1917     he once more denounced the danger of ‘leaving everything     to the unalterable will of the Master,' be he brahmin or     Englishman. 21\nThe duality Berlin points to is well   reflected also in Tagore's attitude toward cultural diversity. He   wanted Indians to learn what is going on elsewhere, how others   lived, what they valued, and so on, while remaining interested   and involved in their own culture and heritage. Indeed, in his   educational writings the need for synthesis is strongly stressed.   It can also be found in his advice to Indian students abroad. In   1907 he wrote to his son-in-law Nagendranath Gangulee, who had   gone to America to study agriculture:\nTo get on familiar terms with the local     people is a part of your education. To know only agriculture is     not enough; you must know America too. Of course if, in the     process of knowing America, one begins to lose one's identity     and falls into the trap of becoming an Americanised person     contemptuous of everything Indian, it is preferable to stay in     a locked room.\nTagore was strongly involved in protest   against the Raj on a number of occasions, most notably in the   movement to resist the 1905 British proposal to split in two the   province of Bengal, a plan that was eventually withdrawn   following popular resistance. He was forthright in denouncing the   brutality of British rule in India, never more so than after the   Amritsar massacre of April 13, 1919, when 379 unarmed people at a   peaceful meeting were gunned down by the army, and two thousand   more were wounded. Between April 23 and 26, Rabindranath wrote   five agitated letters to C.F. Andrews, who himself was extremely   disturbed, especially after he was told by a British civil   servant in India that thanks to this show of strength, the \"moral   prestige\" of the Raj had \"never been higher.\"\nA month after the massacre, Tagore wrote to   the Viceroy of India, asking to be relieved of the knighthood he   had accepted four years earlier:\nThe disproportionate severity of the       punishments inflicted upon the unfortunate people and the       methods of carrying them out, we are convinced, are without       parallel in the history of civilized governments, barring some       conspicuous exceptions, recent and remote. Considering that       such treatment has been meted out to a population, disarmed and       resourceless, by a power which has the most terribly efficient       organisation for destruction of human lives, we must strongly       assert that it can claim no political expediency, far less       moral justification ... The universal agony of indignation       roused in the hearts of our people has been ignored by our       rulers - possibly congratulating themselves for imparting what       they imagine as salutary lessons ... I for my part want to       stand, shorn of all special distinctions, by the side of those       of my countrymen who for their so-called insignificance are     liable to suffer a degradation not fit for human beings.\nBoth Gandhi and Nehru expressed their   appreciation of the important part Tagore took in the national   struggle. It is fitting that after independence, India chose a   song of Tagore (\"Jana Gana Mana Adhinayaka,\" which can be roughly   translated as \"the leader of people's minds\") as its national   anthem. Since Bangladesh would later choose another song of   Tagore (\"Amar Sonar Bangla\") as its national anthem, he may be   the only one ever to have authored the national anthems of two   different countries.\nTagore's criticism of the British   administration of India was consistently strong and grew more   intense over the years. This point is often missed, since he made   a special effort to dissociate his criticism of the Raj from any   denigration of British - or Western - people and culture.   Mahatma Gandhi's well-known quip in reply to a question, asked in   England, on what he thought of Western civilization (\"It would be   a good idea\") could not have come from Tagore's lips. He would   understand the provocations to which Gandhi was responding -   involving cultural conceit as well as imperial tyranny. D.H.   Lawrence supplied a fine example of the former: \"I become more   and more surprised to see how far higher, in reality, our   European civilization stands than the East, Indian and Persian,   ever dreamed of .... This fraud of looking up to   them - this wretched worship-of-Tagore attitude is   disgusting.\" But, unlike Gandhi, Tagore could not, even in jest,   be dismissive of Western civilization.\nForthright in denouncing the brutality of       British rule in India.\nPortrait by W. Rothenstein\nEven in his powerful indictment of British   rule in India in 1941, in a lecture which he gave on his last   birthday, and which was later published as a pamphlet under the   title Crisis in Civilization, he strains hard to maintain   the distinction between opposing Western imperialism and   rejecting Western civilization. While he saw India as having been   \"smothered under the dead weight of British administration\"   (adding \"another great and ancient civilization for whose recent   tragic history the British cannot disclaim responsibility is   China\"), Tagore recalls what India has gained from \"discussions   centred upon Shakespeare's drama and Byron's poetry and above   all ... the large-hearted liberalism of nineteenth-century   English politics.\" The tragedy, as Tagore saw it, came from the   fact that what \"was truly best in their own civilization, the   upholding of dignity of human relationships, has no place in the   British administration of this country.\" \"If in its place they   have established, baton in hand, a reign of 'law and order,' or   in other words a policeman's rule, such a mockery of civilization   can claim no respect from us.\"\nCritique of Patriotism\nRabindranath rebelled against the strongly   nationalist form that the independence movement often took, and   this made him refrain from taking a particularly active part in   contemporary politics. He wanted to assert India's right to be   independent without denying the importance of what India could   learn - freely and profitably - from abroad. He was   afraid that a rejection of the West in favor of an indigenous   Indian tradition was not only limiting in itself; it could easily   turn into hostility to other influences from abroad, including   Christianity, which came to parts of India by the fourth century;   Judaism, which came through Jewish immigration shortly after the   fall of Jerusalem, as did Zoroastrianism through Parsi   immigration later on (mainly in the eighth century), and, of   course - and most importantly - Islam, which has had a very strong presence in India since the tenth century.\nTagore's criticism of patriotism is a   persistent theme in his writings. As early as 1908, he put his   position succinctly in a letter replying to the criticism of   Abala Bose, the wife of a great Indian scientist, Jagadish   Chandra Bose: \"Patriotism cannot be our final spiritual shelter;   my refuge is humanity. I will not buy glass for the price of   diamonds, and I will never allow patriotism to triumph over   humanity as long as I live.\" His novel Ghare Baire (The   Home and the World) has much to say about this theme. In the   novel, Nikhil, who is keen on social reform, including women's   liberation, but cool toward nationalism, gradually loses the   esteem of his spirited wife, Bimala, because of his failure to be   enthusiastic about anti-British agitations, which she sees as a   lack of patriotic commitment. Bimala becomes fascinated with   Nikhil's nationalist friend Sandip, who speaks brilliantly and   acts with patriotic militancy, and she falls in love with him.   Nikhil refuses to change his views: \"I am willing to serve my   country; but my worship I reserve for Right which is far greater   than my country. To worship my country as a god is to bring a   curse upon it.\" 22\nAs the story unfolds, Sandip becomes angry   with some of his countrymen for their failure to join the   struggle as readily as he thinks they should (\"Some Mohamedan   traders are still obdurate\"). He arranges to deal with the   recalcitrants by burning their meager trading stocks and   physically attacking them. Bimala has to acknowledge the   connection between Sandip's rousing nationalistic sentiments and   his sectarian - and ultimately violent-actions. The dramatic   events that follow (Nikhil attempts to help the victims, risking   his life) include the end of Bimala's political romance.\nThis is a difficult subject, and Satyajit   Ray's beautiful film of The Home and the World brilliantly   brings out the novel's tensions, along with the human affections   and disaffections of the story. Not surprisingly, the story has   had many detractors, not just among dedicated nationalists in   India. Georg Lukács found Tagore's novel to be \"a petit   bourgeois yarn of the shoddiest kind,\" \"at the intellectual   service of the British police,\" and \"a contemptible caricature of   Gandhi.\" It would, of course, be absurd to think of Sandip as   Gandhi, but the novel gives a \"strong and gentle\" warning, as   Bertolt Brecht noted in his diary, of the corruptibility of   nationalism, since it is not even-handed. Hatred of one group can   lead to hatred of others, no matter how far such feeling may be   from the minds of large-hearted nationalist leaders like Mahatma   Gandhi.\nAdmiration and Criticism of   Japan\nTagore's reaction to nationalism in Japan   is particularly telling. As in the case of India, he saw the need   to build the self-confidence of a defeated and humiliated people,   of people left behind by developments elsewhere, as was the case   in Japan before its emergence during the nineteenth century. At   the beginning of one of his lectures in Japan in 1916   (\"Nationalism in Japan\"), he observed that \"the worst form of   bondage is the bondage of dejection, which keeps men hopelessly   chained in loss of faith in themselves.\" Tagore shared the   admiration for Japan widespread in Asia for demonstrating the   ability of an Asian nation to rival the West in industrial   development and economic progress. He noted with great   satisfaction that Japan had \"in giant strides left centuries of   inaction behind, overtaking the present time in its foremost   achievement.\" For other nations outside the West, he said, Japan   \"has broken the spell under which we lay in torpor for ages,   taking it to be the normal condition of certain races living in certain geographical limits.\"\nBut then Tagore went on to criticize the   rise of a strong nationalism in Japan, and its emergence as an   imperialist nation. Tagore's outspoken criticisms did not please   Japanese audiences and, as E.P. Thompson wrote, \"the welcome   given to him on his first arrival soon cooled.\" 23 Twenty-two years later, in 1937, during the   Japanese war on China, Tagore received a letter from Rash Behari   Bose, an anti-British Indian revolutionary then living in Japan,   who sought Tagore's approval for his efforts there on behalf of   Indian independence, in which he had the support of the Japanese   government. Tagore replied:\nYour cable has caused me many restless     hours, for it hurts me very much to have to ignore your appeal.     I wish you had asked for my cooperation in a cause against     which my spirit did not protest. I know, in making this appeal,     you counted on my great regard for the Japanese for I, along     with the rest of Asia, did once admire and look up to Japan and     did once fondly hope that in Japan Asia had at last discovered     its challenge to the West, that Japan's new strength would be     consecrated in safeguarding the culture of the East against     alien interests. But Japan has not taken long to betray that     rising hope and repudiate all that seemed significant in her     wonderful, and, to us symbolic, awakening, and has now become     itself a worse menace to the defenceless peoples of the     East.\nHow to view Japan's position in the Second   World War was a divisive issue in India. After the war, when   Japanese political leaders were tried for war crimes, the sole   dissenting voice among the judges came from the Indian judge,   Radhabinod Pal, a distinguished jurist. Pal dissented on various   grounds, among them that no fair trial was possible in view of   the asymmetry of power between the victor and the defeated.   Ambivalent feelings in India toward the Japanese military   aggression, given the unacceptable nature of British imperialism,   possibly had a part in predisposing Pal to consider a perspective   different from that of the other judges.\nMore tellingly, Subhas Chandra Bose (no   relation of Rash Behari Bose), a leading nationalist, made his   way to Japan during the war via Italy and Germany after escaping   from a British prison; he helped the Japanese to form units of   Indian soldiers, who had earlier surrendered to the advancing   Japanese army, to fight on the Japanese side as the \"Indian   National Army.\" Rabindranath had formerly entertained great   admiration for Subhas Bose as a dedicated nonsectarian fighter   for Indian independence. 24 But their   ways would have parted when Bose's political activities took this   turn, although Tagore was dead by the time Bose reached   Japan.\nTagore saw Japanese militarism as   illustrating the way nationalism can mislead even a nation of   great achievement and promise. In 1938 Yone Noguchi, the   distinguished poet and friend of Tagore (as well as of Yeats and   Pound), wrote to Tagore, pleading with him to change his mind   about Japan. Rabindranath's reply, written on September 12, 1938,   was altogether uncompromising:\nIt seems to me that it is futile for either     of us to try to convince the other, since your faith in the     infallible right of Japan to bully other Asiatic nations into     line with your Government's policy is not shared by me ....     Believe me, it is sorrow and shame, not anger, that prompt me     to write to you. I suffer intensely not only because the     reports of Chinese suffering batter against my heart, but     because I can no longer point out with pride the example of a     great Japan.\nHe would have been much happier with the   postwar emergence of Japan as a peaceful power. Then, too, since   he was not free of egotism, he would also have been pleased by   the attention paid to his ideas by the novelist Yasunari Kawabata   and others. 25\nYasunari Kawabata\n\n"
