The bladder is generally made of butyl rubber. Composite leather basketballs, on the other hand, are good for both indoor and outdoors play.\nThere are other factors to be kept in mind while selecting a basketball. This is ensured by even pebbling and wide channels on the surface of the ball.  If used outdoors, they tend to crack easily. If you choose expensive basketballs with snazzy designs, they may not be able to last the rigors of outdoor play. Apart from these materials, basketballs for recreational games or children’s matches are made of materials as varied as plastic and foam. The core is made of rubber or sponge, or a mix of both. Almost all basketball retailers offer the NBA prescribed size chart that you can consult before purchasing a basketball. Does it afford a good grip? The Wilson Evolution series, for example, have a Dura fiber cover which helps the fingers grip the ball tightly. But for playing outdoors on rough surfaces,  rubber basketballs are the best.\nLeather basketballs are suitable only for indoor play. The third most important factor is durability- does the basketball retain it’s bounce after regular use or goes flat after a few weeks play?  .  Each type of basketball has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nThen there is the question of price- it is important to remember that expensive brands may not always give value for money.\nBasketballs were first manufactured around 1894 by Albert G Spalding. Size and weight are also important factors while choosing a basketball.\nBasketballs have three parts, the outer shell, the inner core, and the innermost bladder. The basketball as we know it came about in 1934, with the official size 7, or 30″, being decided as the standard basketball size for men.  The outer shell maybe made of leather, composite leather, synthetic leather, or rubber.\nAlso, the bounce of the basketball must be smooth\nA sports trivia, with amazing facts and figures in just what’s needed then.\nHere is an easy sports trivia, which will be thoroughly enjoyed by kids too.\nThe creator of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, was the first keeper for which English football club?\nAFC Portsmouth\nWhich boxer was an underdog with odds of 42:1 when he stunned Mike Tyson?\nBuster Douglas: 1990\nIn cross-country bike racing, what do the initials BMX represent?\nBicycle moto x (cross)\nWhich type of ball was basketball played with until 1929?\nSoccer ball\nIn which year was the first Wimbledon tournament held?\n1877\nWho is the only coach to win both a Super Bowl and a Rose Bowl?\nDick Vermeil\nWhat was banned from 1967 to 1976?\nSlam dunk\nWhich was the only team to win two World Series in the 1980s?\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers\nWhich was the first televised game of the NFL?\nOct 22, 1939: The Brooklyn Dodgers Vs.

In medical terms, beta blockers are also referred to as beta-adrenergic blocking agents.\nWorking of Beta Blockers. By doing so, the negative effects of this drug can be minimized to some extent. Following are some of the reported side effects.\nA beta blocker works by blocking the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine hormones from coming into contact with the beta receptors of the body. To mention a few, this medication is recommended for the management of high blood pressure or hypertension, chest pain, abnormal heart rhythm, heart attacks, migraines, bronchoconstriction, anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, glaucoma, tremor, and uterine contractions. Consequently, it dilates blood vessels for promoting blood flow. According to the patient’s needs, this drug is prescribed in specific doses.\nIncreased fatigue and tiredness are two of the most commonly observed beta blocker side effects.\nIf the beta blocker is acting on the heart, then it may slow down the heart rate and cause irregular heartbeat.\nAfter taking this drug, an individual may experience cold hands and feet which is due to lack of blood circulation in these parts.\nAny type may cause dry skin, mouth, and eyes.\nAbnormal bowel movement, particularly diarrhea is also a negative effect of beta blocker medication.\nAfter taking this treatment drug, some people manifest anxiety and depression symptoms.\nAnother common effect of beta blockers is swelling and/or inflammation of the hands and feet.\nIn diabetic patients, it may result in abnormal blood sugar levels, usually a sudden increase in the blood glucose.\nA few people complain of difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, and wheezing after ingesting beta blocker.\nThose who are sensitive to this group of drugs may show allergy signs (skin rash, dizziness, and breathing problem) after taking them.\nIn case, sore throat, bleeding, and easy bruising are exhibited after ingesting this prescription drug, call the doctor without delay.\nSpeaking about the adverse effect of beta blocker eye drop, it may cause blurred vision and temporary eye discomfort.\nSome of the rare side effects of beta blockers include abnormally low blood pressure, confusion, sleep disturbance, vomiting, stomach cramps, and sudden weight gain. Considering these aspects, a particular beta blocker drug of a particular dosage may be safe for a person, while it may cause potential health effects in another person. In order to avoid such unpredictable cases, it is always advisable to consult and seek advice from a qualified physician prior to and after taking the medications. Though it is a reliable medication for some diseases, this therapeutic formulation can worsen other health conditions like very low blood pressure, liver disorder, kidney disease, diabetes, asthma, emphysema, and other pulmonary ailments. Their effectiveness depends on the responses and/or sensitivity of the individual towards the medication and the dosage. It is to be noted that beta blockers also interact with other medications. Most likely, the doctor will suggest gradual reduction in the dosage intake to prevent any withdrawal symptoms.\nSide Effects of Beta Blockers\nBeta blocker, represented as ?-blocker, is a group of drugs that are prescribed for treating several chronic health conditions. Also, stopping the drug abruptly results in a series of health problems. If yes, then the type of beta blocker and individual specific dose are decided carefully. However, as it affects several parts of the body, some mild to severe adverse reactions are quite possible. That’s why, taking medical history and health check-up of a patient are mandatory prior to prescribing this drug.\nOn the safety note, the physician is the best person who will determine whether a beta blocker is appropriate for the patient’s condition or not. Beta blocker basically acts on ?1 and ?2 receptors, which in turn helps to reduce heartbeat rate and lower blood pressure. They are located in different regions of the body such as fat cells, arteries, lungs, heart, kidney, brain, uterus, etc. There are several types of beta blocker; some act only on the heart and blood vessels, while others affect the heart, blood vessels, and air passages\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nThe Trailblazer: Jackie Robinson By Larry Canale The Trailblazer: Jackie Robinson By Larry Canale Scoring: MICHAEL JORDAN BY MATTHEW 23 Early Life Michael Jeffery ...
