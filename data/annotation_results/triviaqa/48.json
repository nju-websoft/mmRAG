Actor William Shatner has owned a handful of Doberman Pinschers over time, their names were Kirk ... Breed Breakdown: Doberman Pinscher - unleashmagazine.com Breed Breakdown: Doberman Pinscher\nBreed Breakdown: Doberman Pinscher\nFast as the wind and strong as a bull, the Doberman Pinscher has proven itself to be one of the world’s elite canines. They are known for their agility, intelligence, speed, stamina and strength. Amazingly enough, this breed originated in Germany and was bred by a German man named Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann in the 1860s for those purposes. This is of course where the Doberman, also known as Dobes, get their name. Louis wanted to create a guard dog that would protect him as he traveled through dangerous communities filled with thieves. They are a mix between German Pinschers, Beaucerons, Manchester Terriers, Greyhounds and Rottweilers. This very interesting mix of dogs produced a magnificent animal. Not only do they make loyal companions, but they also are great for search and rescue, military and police work, guarding, therapy work and competitive obedience.\n    So what makes this dog so good at what it does? Well, its body is very muscular. The chest is broad and legs are perfectly straight. Dobes have perfect strides when they run, as their hind legs are in sync with their front legs. This gives them fast capabilities to hunt down their prey. Doberman Pinscher’s heads are long and the tops of their heads are flat. Their sleek head give them advantage in their surroundings. As for their teeth, they meet in a scissor-like bite. Their coats are coarse and can range from black, red, fawn, and even to blue.  An interesting breed fact is that their nose matches the color of the coat. Because their coats are short they can be sensitive to cold weather.  These dogs shed very little, so maintenance is minimal. The Doberman's expectancy of life is 10 to 13 years.\n     Due to the breed’s ability to comprehend what it learns, the Doberman Pinscher can be a very clever dog. They are smart and relatively easy to train. With such a unique breed, come special requirements as an owner.  Because Dobermans can be stubborn at times, they require a handler who is assertive and confident. Also, early socialization is important in effort to curtail shy and timid-like behavior.\n    Alike all dogs, the Doberman can be a pleasure to own if cared for properly. A helpful tip when considering this breed is to allow them plenty of physical activity. Dobes need enough space to run and stretch, therefore apartment life isn’t recommended. Common health issues of the breed include bloating, hip dysplasia, minor heart defects and prostatic disease.\n      Well known owners of the breed are President John F. Kennedy, who’s Doberman was named Moe. Actor William Shatner has owned a handful of Doberman Pinschers over time, their names were Kirk, Morgan, China, Heidi, Paris, Royale, Martika, Sterling, Charity, Bella and Starbuck. Even Mariah Carey flaunted her Doberman, Princess, in her “All I Want For Christmas is You” video.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nIt's a fast paced tale of five doberman pinschers who hold up ...

The Doberman Gang Reviews & Ratings - IMDb The Doberman Gang  Reviews & Ratings - IMDb\nIMDb\n16 out of 16 people found the following review useful:\nRidiculous but entertaining crime caper\nfrom Oakland CA\n21 September 2000\nI seem to remember this film being a pretty big hit when it came out in 1972 and it's easy to understand why. It's a fast paced tale of five doberman pinschers who hold up a bank and get away with the loot. There are some rather dull human beings around but pay them no attention--this is all about the dogs.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n11 out of 11 people found the following review useful:\nThe best movie EVER about dogs robbing a bank.\nAuthor: hausrathman\n20 February 2003\nA group of clever criminals train a six Doberman Pinchers to rob a bank for them in this low-budget crime caper film.  Director Byron Chudnow doesn't display a great deal of finesse, nor does the cast of unknowns for that matter, but he manages to get the job done.  One of the better B-caper films of its time.  This is a guilty pleasure I return to time and time again.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n10 out of 10 people found the following review useful:\nGreat B-Caper Film\nfrom Los Angeles, California\n10 October 2003\nI remember seeing this when I was just six years old and I really enjoyed it.  This was probably one of the most outlandish films I ever saw, but it is still a great film to watch.  Even though the budget was low and the acting is barely professional, it still was a great treat.  Also, even though there are a few violent moments, especially when one of the dogs attacks the bank guard, it is still something that I wouldn't mind showing younger kids.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n8 out of 8 people found the following review useful:\nAmiable low-budget caper movie\nfrom Victoria, BC\n4 October 2003\nTraining 6 doberman dogs to rob a bank? Actually, this outlandish premise is executed with far more believability than you'd think. The criminals behind the dogs are not portrayed as buffoons or as totally unredeemable; in fact, they are pretty likable guys for the most part. (And - shock of all shocks - it's the Vietnam veteran character who comes across as the most sympathetic!) As well, we are taken through the plan step by step, seeing how they slowly train the dogs and deal with any potential problems that come up during the way. It's a little dry at times (the low budget doesn't exactly make it flashy), but never does it get really boring. The only thing I question about the movie is how it got a \"G\" rating, given a couple of (mild, admitedly) love scenes and a couple of *seriously* bloody sequences! Those bloody sequences really shatter the agreeably fluffy and light tone, and make it questionable as a family movie. Despite that, the movie was pretty successful, subsequently generating two theatrical sequels and one made-for-TV movie.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n5 out of 6 people found the following review useful:\none of the dumbest movies of the 70s- which means, more or less, that it's also awesome\nfrom United States\n12 April 2007\nI had to make sure not to lose it too much during the Doberman Gang, because simply put it's got the goofiest premise one could ever think to not imagine: dogs that rob banks. You got it, simply put, and trained by bank robbers who'd rather let the mutts get it done then do it themselves, in an elaborate scheme involving whistles made for each dog, OVER-elaborate training montages teaching the dogs how to, well, jump and bite the crap out of people, and throwing in a really inane romantic triangle between three main characters- the mastermind behind the caper, a waitress, and the dogs' trainer- leading up to an ending that had me laughing my head off not even caring what the hell had just happened. If I tried to explain it all it would make even less sense and one would wonder how in Heaven's name something like this could get funding. Well, it was the 70s, and movies like this filled a niche for kids wanting a quick fix of delirious hijinks and adults wanting a good nap. As an adult myself, however, the delirious part had me from start to finish.\nIt's not just the dogs and getting trained, or how the robbery is planned and the dogs meant to be dispatched (and the wretched ways the filmmakers get around making it violent, but not quite violent enough for an R at the time), or the extraordinarily cheesy songs (by Alan Silvestri no less!), or that the filmmakers decided to throw in an unbelievably underdeveloped sub-plot involving the three main characters- scuse me, caricatures- or even that one of the bank robbers looks very oddly like Kurt Vonnegut. Actually, it's a sum of this and more, and it's got enough to laugh about for days. There's not a slice of logic to the proceedings, and one can figure on director Bryon Chudnow, who with one obscure exception directed nothing BUT Doberman movies for the rest of his career afterwords (yes, more than one; they even got Fred Astaire for the third movie), likes it that way. Bank robbery, of course, is never an easy thing, but the central joy of the Doberman Gang is that it's meant to look like it's nothing when planned to a T. In the midst of all this, dramatic tension or suspense is at zero, and the line between what may be meant as sick jokes or just so-serious-it's-funny bits (like the dog that, sad to say, get's run over, and the dog that comes by and just snatched up the leftover money).\nIn truth, some of it is almost too goofy to really get into, and for kids that could in some weird chance come across it today some jokes will fly over heads (Bonnie and Clyde as names of the Dobermans, J. Edgar Hoover as the bulldog, who is maybe the most convincing and well-rounded character in the picture if that says anything). But for a certain section of fans of B-movies of the 1970s looking for something not as trashy or rough as an AIP picture may want to take a glance at this crazy turkey that, unfortunately in this day and age, could conceivably get a remake someday if it has not yet.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n3 out of 3 people found the following review useful:\nGreat B-movie caper, with the dogs as the big stars...\nfrom Canada\n6 July 2006\nConsidering that the main cast are primarily television bit actors, they gel together very well. Even director Byron Chudnow's primary work was producing and editing in television, which probably goes a long way to explain why the film is so economically paced. Julie Parrish was most recognized for appearing opposite Elvis Presley in \"Paradise, Hawaiian Style\", and briefly in Star Trek's \"The Menagerie\" (part 1).\nThe film is notable especially for being composer Alan Sylvestri's first motion picture score (alternating between dramatic and humorous), with absolutely no prior composing experience, and a two week deadline. He would eventually be linked regularly to director Robert Zemeckis, enjoying a working relationship similar to Steven Spielberg and John Williams.\nExtremely entertaining and generally a well paced film, rated GP on original theatrical prints (re-classified PG) for a couple of bloody sequences.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n5 out of 7 people found the following review useful:\nthe dog'gonest gang you ever did see...\nfrom the blurred line between dreams and reality\n30 May 2002\nI really liked this film, I thought it was a good, fun romp and I liked the mix of light-hearted moments and the slightly grittier more exciting parts.\nI will admit that I also loved the two main songs in the film aswell -the theme tune and the romantic one, really enjoyed them, 70's or not!\nAnd of course there were lots of beautiful, precious doggies - who are (as others so rightly pointed out) the real stars of the film!, the main human leads were all solid but forgettable.\nOverall pretty good, and the ending is just perfect, see this fun film if you can.\nWas the above review useful to you?\nThis is a  WOOF  hold up! Put your paws in the air and give me all your biscuits!\nfrom the Draconian Swamp of Unholy Souls\n11 June 2016\nCertain seventies movies have such a bonkers plot concept that you have to watch them, if only just to see with your own eyes how they elaborated the idea! Take \"The Doberman Gang\", for instance. Following a screwed-up bank heist (they put the loot in the trunk of the wrong getaway car) and a romantic night with waitress June, the embittered ex-con Eddie comes up with the brilliant plan to train six fierce Doberman dogs to commit a bank robbery, so that he and his buddies can observe from a distance without running any risks. Brilliant, isn't it? So does this mean that \"The Doberman Gang\" is a fantastic 70s crime-caper gem with plenty of virulent action sequences and spectacular animal stunts? Unfortunately not  It's more of a slow-paced comedy/buddy movie with enormous amounts of dog training footage and a LOT of country music montages. Eddie enlists the help of former police dog trainer Barney, even though he only worked with German Shepard dogs before and initially doesn't know what he's training the Dobermans for, and puts together a forceful dog pack with the glorious sounding names of legendary bank robbers like Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Ma Barker, Baby Face Nelson and  of course  Bonnie and Clyde. Unless you have a strong affection for this particular type of dogs (like my mother-in-law, who for some reason collects everything that has to do with Dobermans) there's very little to recommend here. The first 70 or so minutes are quite dull and substantially void, unless you like country music, and the only things to enjoy are the charismatic dogs and the reasonably sympathetic acting performances of the second-rate bank robbers Sammy Bow and JoJo D'Amore. The actual bank heist is obviously a lot more entertaining and the tricks of the dogs and their trek back home are quite exhilarating to watch. There isn't any violence or verbal/physical brutality, so it's perfectly suitable for younger audiences.\nWas the above review useful to you?\nGood Fun\nfrom United Kingdom\n10 April 2012\n1972 is a long time ago and judged by todays standards many might dismiss this as a poor B movie flick. On the other hand judged by todays TV standards this is a great laugh and if it was produced now it would be a success. We love dogs and hate banks. How often have you sat on the porch looking at the stars and wondered how the hell can I get back at the bank who just charged £30 for going slightly overdrawn. Mans best friend comes to the rescue. The producer of this film deserves full credit for his foresight and a remake is long overdue perhaps with Brad Pitt as the staring role and Courtney love as the lead Doberman. Okay with died hair. I jest, just love a so called 'B' movie form 1972 thats entertaining.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n1 out of 2 people found the following review useful:\nA really cool and enjoyable oddball 70's crime caper flick\nfrom The Last New Jersey Drive-In on the Left\n28 February 2007\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\nThis really choice and pleasingly idiosyncratic early 70's low-budget canine crime caper winner delivers the quirky low-key nickel'n'dime junk movie goods with mucho gusto and a welcome dearth of pretense. Irascible criminal mastermind Eddie, fed up with the gross constant ineptitude of his hopelessly fallible human cohorts, kidnaps and trains a sextet of non-error prone super-sharp Doberman pinchers to pull off an intricate bank heist. This funky little number hits all the necessary bases: we've got a speedy steady pace, competent, assured direction by Bryon Ross Chudnow, nifty gritty lowlife characters, solid pro acting, a crankin' soulful heavy on the brass score by Bradford Craig and Alan Silvestri, exquisite crystal clear cinematography by Robert Caramico, a terrifically tense heist set piece, cheesy montages set to marvelously mawkish light FM tunes, and even a slight mild sprinkling of good old fashioned gratuitous sex and violence. Bonus points are in order for both the fabulously corny country-and-western theme song (\"They were the dog gonest gang that man did ever see\") and the fact that each dobie is named after a notorious 30's Depression era criminal (Ma Parker, Dillinger, Bonnie, Clyde, etc.). In short, this fun flick overall rates as the totally authentic gnarly article.\nWas the above review useful to you?\nPage 1 of 2:\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nTitle: The Doberman Gang (1972) 6 /10.
