Hoover Dam Or Boulder Dam - Last Minute Bookings Hoover Dam Or Boulder Dam\nHoover Dam or Boulder         Dam?\n \nHome > Nevada > Las         Vegas > Hoover         Dam > Hoover Dam or Boulder Dam?\nIs                       it  Hoover Dam or                        Boulder Dam ...?\n... or what's in name when politicians get involved?\nHow the Hoover Dam got to be officially named         after Herbert Hoover is a convoluted story that involves politics and events not specifically related to the                 project other than the impact it has had on the southwest.\nApparently                 many people and politicians were resentful of how Herbert Hoover                 handled the economy when he was president and did not want                 Hoover's name associated with a project that was so beneficial                 to the southwest. While Hoover was the most critical player in                 getting the project underway naming the project after him was                 seen as a political statement and seemed to take advantage of                 the fact that the original site for the project was moved. \nWhen the project began the location of the dam was to be at Boulder Canyon about 10                 miles upstream from the current location. Thus the name 'Boulder                 Canyon Project'. It                 was noticed later that if the dam were built                 at Black Canyon instead of Boulder Canyon, it would be able to                 impound more water. Also, geologically, Black Canyon had a more                 dense rock in its canyon walls.                 When the dam site was moved to Black Canyon, it was still called                 the Boulder Canyon Project. The dam got its name from the                 project which originated it, 'Boulder Dam'.\nOn September 17, 1930, Herbert Hoover's Secretary of the                 Interior Ray L. Wilbur, went to the site to dedicate the                 official start of the project. In his dedication speech, he                 announced that the dam would from that point on be officially                 known as Hoover Dam. All things considered this was a pretty                 unpopular idea at the                 time. The idea behind this move was to bolster Hoover's image.\nIn 1930,                       the Great Depression was getting worse and Hoover was                       either blamed for it or castigated for not doing  anything about it. Herbert Hoover wanting to be re-elected                       in 1932, felt that he needed to show that he was sensitive                       to the situation. By naming the dam after himself, he                       thought that he could draw attention to the fact that he                       was instrumental in starting the project. With over 5000                       people to be employed on the project, Hoover thought that                       he could claim credit for trying to do something about the                       unemployment situation which was extreme at that time.                       Unfortunately for Hoover, it did not work out that way.\nOn                       May 8, 1933, Harold Ickes, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary                       of the Interior, decided that the name of the dam should                       be \"Boulder Dam\", its original name. The reason for this                       was no doubt political.\nOn April 30, 1947, the resolution renaming the dam back to                       Hoover Dam was passed by congress and signed by President                       Harry S. Truman. Today Hoover                 Dam is still the name of this structure.\nMore                         Hoover                         Dam Information\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\n... the dam project simply adopted the title Boulder Dam.

WGBH American Experience    | PBS\nOther General Articles\nBy the time it was officially dedicated on September 30, 1935, the colossal dam project on the Southern Nevada portion of the Colorado river had been called by several different names. In the exploratory stage, the project was referred to as the Boulder Canyon Project. Boulder Canyon was replaced by Black Canyon, when Black Canyon was discovered to be a more suitable spot to place the dam. Having started its legislative life under the moniker of Boulder Canyon, the dam project simply adopted the title Boulder Dam. All of that changed, temporarily at least, on September 17, 1930, when Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur journeyed to the Nevada desert to drive the spike marking the project’s official start. Sweating profusely through his inappropriate wool suit, Wilbur announced, “I have the honor and privilege of giving a name to this new structure. In Black Canyon, under the Boulder Canyon Project Act, it shall be called the Hoover Dam.” Hoover was Wilbur’s boss and the current president of the United States,  Herbert Hoover . He was also, in Wilbur’s estimation, “the great engineer whose vision and persistence, first as chairman of the Colorado River Commission in 1922, and on so many other occasions since, has done so much to make [the Hoover Dam] possible.” Wilbur’s unofficial dedication was greeted with much derision, as the country at the moment was suffering through a crippling depression for which many citizens placed blame squarely on Hoover’s shoulders. The naming of a momentous public works project in his honor was seen by many as bald-faced public relations and little more. Even after Wilbur’s proclamation, the dam was referred to in the press by both names, but it was called Hoover in all official documents and congressional appropriations bills.\nWhen Hoover lost the White House to  Franklin Roosevelt  in 1932, Wilbur lost his position as Interior Secretary to  Harold Ickes . Shortly thereafter, Hoover also lost his dam. On May 8, 1933, Ickes decided that the dam in Black Canyon would revert to being called Boulder Dam. Ickes defended his decision by stating, “The men who pioneered this project knew it by this name.” He failed to mention that Herbert Hoover was one of those men.\nFew doubted that Ickes’ action was politically motivated and personally charged; he didn’t like Hoover and rejected the notion of his name being attached to any project that would be regarded with honor. Ickes carried his snubbing of Hoover all the way to the day of the dam’s dedication. “This great engineering achievement,” Ickes said, “should not carry the name of any living man but, on the contrary, should be baptized with a designation as bold and characteristic and imagination-stirring as the dam itself.” Ickes failed to mention that dam sites named after Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Calvin Coolidge already existed in Alabama and Arizona. For his part, Hoover, in his memoirs, maintained that having the dam stripped of his name was unimportant.\nTwelve years later, Hoover was vindicated when House Resolution 140 was introduced and passed by the 80th Congress. The resolution read, in part, “as President, Herbert Hoover took an active part in settling the engineering problems and location of the dam in Black Canyon…” and noted that “the construction contracts were signed under his administration, and when he left office construction had been pushed to a point where it was more than a year ahead of schedule.” On April 30, 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed the resolution and restored the name Hoover Dam to the structure.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nHoover Dam is named for Mr. Herbert Hoover, ... Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur ordered that the dam ... the names \"Boulder Canyon Dam\" and \"Boulder Dam ... Hoover Dam | Bureau of Reclamation Hoover Dam | Bureau of Reclamation\nThe Story of Hoover Dam - Articles\nWhat's In A Name?\nHoover Dam is named for Mr. Herbert Hoover, the Nation's 31st President. When construction of the dam was initiated, on September 30, 1930, Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur ordered that the dam to be built in the Black Canyon of the Colorado as part of the Boulder Canyon Project Act was to be called Hoover Dam. By a Congressional Act of February 14, 1931, this name was made official.\nAfter Mr. Hoover left office, the names \"Boulder Canyon Dam\" and \"Boulder Dam\" were frequently used when referring to the dam, allegedly because the new Secretary of the Interior did not like Mr. Hoover. However, the name of the dam was never officially changed from \"Hoover.\"\nIn the 80th Congress (1947), a number of bills were introduced to \"officially\" restore the name of Hoover Dam.\nOn March 4, 1947, House Resolution 140 was introduced for this purpose. The resolution read:\n\"Herbert Hoover, while Secretary of Commerce in 1922, presided as the representative of the Federal Government over two score meetings of the representatives of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming for the formulation of the Colorado River Compact. He had a major part in bringing the States into agreement. This compact, signed November 24, 1922, made construction of the dam possible by allocating the waters of the river system between the upper and lower Colorado River Basin, settling a 25-year old controversy. The Boulder Canyon Project Act, enacted December 21, 1928, when Mr. Hoover was President-elect, ratified the compact and authorized construction of a dam in Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon, leaving to the Secretary of the Interior the choice of sites. It also laid upon him and the Secretary of the Interior extraordinary responsibilities.\nAs President, Herbert Hoover took an active part in settling the engineering problems and location of the dam in Black Canyon; was required by the Project Act to obtain power and water contracts adequate to assure some $200,000,000 of revenues before construction was begun; settled the difficult and controversial questions involved in the allocation of the power, and made the revenue contracts which Congress required; and proclaimed the Boulder Canyon Project Act to be in effect on June 25, 1929. This Act ratified the Colorado River compact, which Mr. Hoover had signed 7 years before, and subjected all operations of the Boulder Canyon project to that compact. He subsequently reported to Congress, through Secretary Wilbur, compliance with its mandate that this project be built on a self-liquidating basis; Congress made the necessary appropriations (in acts which five times named the dam in his honor); the construction contracts were signed under his administration, and when he left office construction had been pushed to a point where it was more than a year ahead of schedule.\nAfter Mr. Hoover left office, the Interior Department, for reasons that need not be referred to in detail here, avoided the use of the name \"Hoover Dam\" where possible, and used the names\"Boulder Canyon Dam\" or \"Boulder Dam.\"\nAfter hearing testimony relative to the need for clarifying the present situation with regard to the name of this dam, it is apparent to this committee that affirmative legislative action by Congress is desirable.\nIt is particularly timely that this measure honoring Mr. Hoover should come to the floor of the House at a time when he is completing the second of his great humanitarian missions for President Truman in the relief of world-wide suffering.\"\nThe resolution passed the House on March 6, 1947. On April 23, 1947, a companion resolution was passed by the Senate. And, on April 30, 1947, a resolution was signed by President Harry S. Truman restoring the structure's name to Hoover Dam. That resolution reads:\n\"Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That the name of Hoover Dam is hereby restored to the dam on the Colorado River in Black Canyon constructed under the authority of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, approved December 21, 1928 (45 Stat.1057), and referred to as Hoover Dam in the Act approved February 14, 1931 (46 Stat.1146); in the Act approved April 22, 1932 (47 Stat. 118); in the Act approved July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 535); in the Act approved July 21, 1932 (47 Stat. 717); and in the Act approved February 17, 1933 (47 Stat. 845). Any law, regulation, document or record of the United States in which such dam is designated or referred to under the name of Boulder Dam shall be held to refer to such dam under and by the name of Hoover Dam.\nApproved April 30, 1947.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nBoulder Dam vs. Hoover Dam. ... Wilbur officially named the dam after President Hoover. ... Truman approved a congressional act to rename it, once again, Hoover Dam. Boulder Dam or Hoover Dam? | UNLV Libraries Digital ... Boulder Dam or Hoover Dam? | UNLV Libraries Digital Collections\nUNLV Libraries Digital Collections\nBoulder Dam or Hoover Dam?\nBoulder Canyon Project\nWhen the initial surveys were done to determine the placement of the dam, most agreed that Boulder Canyon would be ideal because of its granite foundation. It was thought that the narrower pass of Black Canyon, made from volcanic deposits, wasn't nearly as strong. However, too many faults were discovered in Boulder Canyon and Black Canyon was eventually chosen for the construction of the dam. Unfortunately, it was too late to disassociate the name Boulder Canyon from the project, and it stuck, even though the dam was built in Black Canyon.\nBoulder Dam vs. Hoover Dam\nBoulder Dam became the unofficial name of the dam because of the name of the project. When work on the dam began in 1930 with the completion of the railroad connecting Black Canyon to Las Vegas, Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur officially named the dam after President Hoover. It was clearly a political move, however, and most people in the area continued to call it Boulder Dam.\nBefore the completion of the dam, a new president was in office. Franklin Roosevelt’s Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, changed the name back to Boulder Dam, a direct affront to Herbert Hoover by the Roosevelt administration. Popular support for the name Boulder Dam was strong. Not only had residents and workers grown accustomed to it, but the name Hoover also had many negative connotations because his administration coincided with the onset of the Depression.\nThis was not the end of the competition between Hoover Dam and Boulder Dam. The name Boulder Dam stuck until 1947 when Harry Truman approved a congressional act to rename it, once again, Hoover Dam.\nThe Dam Today\nIt is not surprising that the name Boulder Dam lives on. The name of the worker’s city is Boulder City and the highway leading from Las Vegas to Boulder City is called Boulder Highway. Former dam workers often refer to it as Boulder Dam and the occasional tourist has been known to say, \"I’ve seen Hoover Dam. But where is this Boulder Dam I keep hearing about?\"\nBrowse Topics\n\n"
