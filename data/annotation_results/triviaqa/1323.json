The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible.\nThe boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her.\nWhen the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him.\nAfter considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. \\\nAfter two recesses to check legal references and confer with the Child Welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Arizona Cardinals, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.\nSteelers Fan\nOn the first day of school a first grade teacher explains to her class that she is a Cardinals fan.\nShe asks her students to raise their hands if they, too, are Cardinals fans.\nWanting to impress their teacher, everyone in the class raises their hand except one little girl.\nThe teacher looks at the girl with surprise, 'Janie, why didn't you raise your hand?'\nBecause I'm not a Cardinals fan,' she replied.\nThe teacher, still shocked, asked, 'Well, if you are not a Cardinals fan, then who are you a fan of?'\n'I am a Steelers fan, and proud of it,' Janie replied.\nThe teacher could not believe her ears. 'Janie please tell us why you are a Steelers fan?'\nBecause my mom is a Steelers fan, and my dad is Steelers fan, so I'm a Steelers fan too!''\nWell,' said the teacher in a obviously annoyed tone, 'that is no reason for you to be a Steelers fan. You don't have to be just like your parents all of the time. What if your mom was an idiot and your dad was a moron, wha t would you be then?'\nThen,' Janie smiled, 'I'd be a Cardinals fan.'\n4 Football Fans\nA Redskins fan, an Eagles fan, a Cardinals fan, and a Steelers fan are climbing a mountain and arguing about who loves his team more.\nThe Redskins fan insists he is the most loyal.

Grab your tickets today and be a part of the excitement!\nArizona Cardinals Overview\nThe Cardinals franchise hasn’t always been based in Arizona, but it has always been around; always as in the Cardinals are the oldest professional football franchise in American history. The team was founded way back in 1898 and called Chicago its home. There isn’t much history to glean from those early years in that there wasn’t really much of a sport of football in existence quite yet. 22 years later though, in 1920, the Cardinals would become one of the charter members of the NFL.\nFrom that point to today, even going through a list of the stadiums the Cardinals have called home is a chore. Things started at a rather apropos place called Normal Park. Through the 1920s, 30s, 40s and 50s, up until the team’s move to St. Louis, the Cardinals played in as many as five different stadiums on game days.\nIn those decades, the franchise would win two championships, the only two titles in its history. The first came in 1925 and comes with a slight asterisk. Chicago finished with the league’s best record, but the Pottsville Maroons were competitors and actually beat the Cardinals head-to-head. However, because of a controversial ruling regarding territory rights, the Maroons were suspended from league rights and privileges; i.e. not eligible for the championship.\nThe second of the Cardinals’ titles came in 1947 and featured no such controversy. However, 68 years later, it remains the last time the organization has been on top of the football world.\nIn 1960, the Chicago Cardinals moved and became the St. Louis Cardinals , where they remained through the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. The team stayed in St. Louis all the way up until 1988. In those days, the team won a pair of division titles but little else. Its coach in the 70s was the soon-to-be legendary head man Don Coryell. Air Coryell, as he would be known as, won Coach of the Year for St. Louis in 1974. Under Coryell, Hall of Fame lineman Dan Dierdorf developed into an All-Pro. Dierdorf would go on to make six Pro Bowls and was a member of the NFL’s All-Decade team for the 1970s. Terry Metcalf also shined under Coryell, setting the NFL all-purpose yards record in 1975, when the Cards won their second division title of the era.\nSuccess would be fleeting though, as it had been in the Chicago days. St. Louis would make the playoffs just one more time before relocating. The Cardinals never won a playoff game their entire time in STL.\nThe first 10 years in Arizona were much the same. The then Phoenix Cardinals (who became just the Arizona Cardinals in 1994) didn’t even make it into the postseason until 1998. That season, they beat the Dallas Cowboys in the first round, the franchise’s first playoff win since its NFL championship in 1947.\nWins were scarce for Arizona through the first few decades in their new home. Star players were also scarce. The ’98 team was led by the immortal Jake Plummer, who played six years for the team, finishing with 90 touchdowns, 114 interceptions and a 55.9 completion percentage.\nOne of the few bright spots on these Cardinals teams was cornerback Aeneas Williams. Williams joined the club in 1991, when they were still called the Phoenix Cardinals. He played 10 years for them, making six of his eight Pro Bowls. Williams was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2014, the lone Cardinal Hall of Famer so far who played mostly under the “Arizona” distinction.\nFrom 1998, it would be yet another 10 years before the team would be back in the playoffs. In 2008 though, it would make a splash.\nBehind quarterback Kurt Warner, the Cardinals would ride an incredibly hot year end all the way to the Super Bowl . There, they met up with the Pittsburgh Steelers and played perhaps the most exciting game in Super Bowl history. Arizona lost in the final seconds in a game that included a 100-yard interception return, a run of 16 unanswered points, a go-ahead touchdown with just over two minutes remaining, and that final score with roughly 30 seconds left to push Arizona’s championship-less streak another year longer.\nAlthough the team has yet to capture that type of playoff glory anytime since, the Cards have been making huge strides during the regular season.\nIn 2013, the team won a surprising 10 games, although still missed the playoffs in a competitive NFC. The next season, with everyone expecting regression, the team played even better, this time reaching 11 victories and a playoff berth. Bruce Arians won Coach of the Year, and the team proved it wasn’t to be trifled with even with a topsy-turvy quarterback carousel.\nFor 2015, Arians and company hope the QB position will be anchored by veteran Carson Palmer, but Palmer is coming off of a severe knee injury. The rest of the roster is super talented, meaning a suitable quarterback performance could mean big things. The defense, led by Calais Campbell and Patrick Peterson, may be the best in the NFL. On offense, the skill positions are teeming with young upside. Andre Ellington, John and Jaron Brown and Michael Floyd are all ready for breakouts. And then there’s Larry Fitzgerald.\nFitzgerald has a case for being the greatest Cardinal in team history, at least since it moved to Arizona. Even with continually shaky quarterbacks leading his offense, Fitzgerald is an eight-time Pro Bowler with over 12,000 receiving yards and more than 900 catches. Both marks put him in the top 25 all-time, and he isn’t done.\nThis long-running organization lacks the storied history of many teams younger than it. There are generations of fans who want nothing more than a Super Bowl trophy for this club. If recent regular-season success is any indication, the Cardinals may be getting closer to that goal than they’ve been in a long, long time.\nMore about Arizona Cardinals on the web\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals announced the hiring of Bruce ...
