March 17, 2008 3:32 AM   Subscribe\nI offer an unqualified apology to Malor and anyone else who might have been offended by my comments .\nI was appalled as I re-read some of my last few comments in that thread.\nI value MeFi in general - and the finance threads specifically - very much due to the high signal to noise ratio.  I fear that some of my comments may have increased the denominator and for that I apologise.\nI should be able - and generally am - capable of entertaining different views and, if not driving towards consensus, than at least disagreeing amicably.  I'm generally better at sensing when I'm pushing folks too hard and backing off or changing tact to achieve consensus.  This time I failed at both initiatives and for that I apologise.\nIt was not and never is my iniative to stifle debate or the expression of views, and if any of my comments were perceived that way I apologise.  I value all contributions to these threads, Malor's specifically.  I've pointed this out before, and I will say this again - he & I agree far more than we disagree.  Once again, if my comments had the effect of surpressing the free exchange of views, I apologise.\nThere were lots of reasons why I wasn't on top of my game yesterday; none are germane to MeFi or that thread, and should not be interpreted as an excuse for my behaviour, but :\ncrappy ass weather here in London,\nsomeone leached our high speed broadband for six days last week and because they downloaded 30GB of OnlyTheGoodLordKnowsWhat we're capped at 56kps for the next week,\nconstruction work on The Tube made it impossible for us to leave The Ghetto yesterday to see a Bansky show in Kensington,\nchanges to non-dom tax rules means our bills have sharply increased unless we leave England,\nHer Majesty's Revenue & Customs suddenly decided to increase the duty levied on MP3 players I import from China,\nbecause of booming sales we have to register our business for VAT which is a total PIA,\ndue to the bandwidth leaching we had to migrate away from WEP and now the entire second floor of our flat is off the wireless LAN as the older Macs run OS X 10.2 and can't speak PKA,\nall day yesterday I was having problems using Carbon Copy Cloner to get 10.4 onto the older Macs,\nTower Hamlets Council is hassling me about the security gates I installed on my flat eight years ago,\nI guess I could work in a few more issues of a highly personal nature that some of you might find disgusting but I'll just stop here ...\nI like to think it hasn't happened before, but I can say with certainty that iit won't happen again folks.\nI'm aware there are some interesting points added to that thread after my last comment, but I'm late for work, and as Monday's are busy meeting days for me I will have to revisit the thread later this evening.\nTake care\nMutant\nposted by Mutant to Etiquette/Policy at 3:32 AM (54 comments total) 2 users marked this as a favorite\nCan you point me to the offending comments, please?\nAll I saw was a bunch of stuff about financial markets before my eyes glazed over.\nposted by UbuRoivas at 4:02 AM on March 17, 2008\nMutant, I found your comments to be almost 100% interesting and informative.\nTowards the end, sure, it got pretty tiresome watching you and Malor argue over what seemed to my outsider's perspective, almost pure semantics, but I don't think that either of you went over the line.\n(though I really wish that the two of you could have agreed to disagree re: definition of \"bubble\")...\nposted by gregvr at 4:21 AM on March 17, 2008\nI'm not offended by your comments in that thread.

I can think of few people in any field with the inside knowledge you have who debate so openly with amateurs and are as ready to acknowledge they themselves might not know all the answers.\nBesides, it was interesting to see the collision in that thread. Malor sees the sky falling in, believes that certain economics professionals are responsible and so is uninterested in changing his language from lay usage to insider usage. You are the insider for whom accurate use of the terminology is a prerequisite for a certain amount of respect. For him the word 'bubble' is a way of linking today to disasters of the past, for you, it is a piece of your overall understanding. Unreconcilable.\nAnd sorry to read what I assume is a reference to piles.\nposted by Busy Old Fool at 5:42 AM on March 17, 2008\nAfter a series of seemingly endless high-profile account closings and narcissistic callouts, this classy apology is a breath of fresh air. Thanks for showing us how its done, Mutant.\nposted by googly at 5:52 AM on March 17, 2008 [ 2 favorites ]\nI tried really really hard to get offended by anything you wrote Mutant. I couldn't manage it. Protip: Try being less coherent, USE CAPS and draw allusions between members of Malor's family and farmyard animals. If that doesn't do it, I usually fall back on the word \"cock-breath.\"\nposted by Jofus at 5:57 AM on March 17, 2008 [ 2 favorites ]\nHuh?  I have no idea what you're apologizing for.  You were argumentative, sure, but that's what MeFi is all about, as long as it's done on the level of clashing ideas rather than personal insults, and this was definitely the former.  I think Busy Old Fool analyzed your and Malor's disagreement very well, and for what it's worth I thought you had the better of it (I hate when people say \"The hell with your definitions and numbers, this is no time to be picky, the sky is falling!\").  But it's certainly better to err on the side of politeness, so good for you for caring.\nposted by languagehat at 7:00 AM on March 17, 2008\nAm I the only one who copy and pasted the ever-tinier list of complaints to see what it said?  Yes? Okay, carry on then.\nposted by sugarfish at 7:04 AM on March 17, 2008 [ 1 favorite ]\nClassy apology, although I think it's unnecessary.  I, too, think you had the better of it, presenting not only the more measured, but also the more referenced view.\nposted by OmieWise at 7:26 AM on March 17, 2008\nWhat Omie said.\nposted by jessamyn (staff) at 7:28 AM on March 17, 2008\nAlso, could you please show up in this thread ?  Thanks.\nposted by languagehat at 7:28 AM on March 17, 2008\nI love financial threads precisely because of the level of discourse and the variety of opinions. I personally oscillate in my opinion of Malor between: \"The guy's nuts, grab 'im!\" and \"Preach on, brother!\" But Mutant, I've always found you to be erudite and insightful. Either way, I praise the differences and cheer the disagreements. There is no black and white truth, but goddamn it if there isn't some shred of civilization and mutual respect in those threads that makes them better than ten times (by volume) all the Obama, Iraq, and the rest of the newsfilter ilk combined.\nposted by Eideteker at 7:33 AM on March 17, 2008\nWhat Eideteker said.\nposted by kuujjuarapik at 7:41 AM on March 17, 2008\nMutant, you are being overly self-critical.  I don't see anything inappropriate with your comments.\nThe finance threads are interesting for me to read.  There are a lot of comments from people who are putting time and effort into discussing a topic and that is appreciated.\nNow if we could only get rid of the dumbasses who clearly have nothing to contribute but Chicken Little screaming and predictions of post-apocalyptic wastelands every time futures are down... then those threads would be a real joy of Metafilter.\nposted by dios at 7:45 AM on March 17, 2008 [ 1 favorite ]\nChicken Little screaming and predictions of post-apocalyptic wastelands every time futures are down...\nI'm no economist, but isn't that part of the game?\nposted by kuujjuarapik at 7:57 AM on March 17, 2008 [ 1 favorite ]\nI'd like to offer my unqualified apology for flunking my Apology Qualification Certification Exam.\nposted by cortex (staff) at 7:58 AM on March 17, 2008 [ 1 favorite ]\nI'd offer my condolences but I'm not a licensed condoler.\nposted by kuujjuarapik at 8:05 AM on March 17, 2008\nYou can get a temporary permit for that.

It is possible to stridently disagree with someone and still maintain a respectful air. (not suggesting that you have been strident, just making a point), if you ever crossed into outright disrespect, I didn't see it.\nNow, next time, when you really want to be offensive, I'd suggest referencing your cock. Several times. Only at the end do you reveal that you are a talking about your pet male chicken, and when people get pissy about it, call them out for being sexist. Then, suggest that the admins are somehow at fault, and that you are being persecuted for your strange sense of humor.\nSee if you can get called out in two different MeTa threads in a single day, and then you will know that you are starting to get under people's skins.\nTill then, you should be fine.\nI do tip my hat to your effort though. It's good that you care enough to apologize for a perceived slight, even if none was apparent. I think it says good things about your character.\nposted by quin at 8:45 AM on March 17, 2008\nMutant, your contributions to financial threads are invaluable.  Please keep up the good work.\nAlso thirding what Eideteker said.\nposted by Fuzzy Monster at 8:52 AM on March 17, 2008\nNot to put too fine a point on it Quin, but if he references cocks he must use \"a bucket of...\".\nOtherwise it's just plain tacky.\nagreed with the above, thought your comments were insightful and well argued.

But when I'm bad, I'm better.\nMarriage is a great institution. I'm not ready for an institution.\nIt's not the man in your life that counts. It's the life in your man.\nIs that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?\nI believe in censorship. After all, I made a fortune out of it.\nI only like two kinds of men: Foreign and Domestic.\nToo much of a good thing is wonderful.\nI'm no model lady. A model's just an imitation of the real thing.\nDon't marry a man to reform him. That's what reform schools are for.\nIt's hard to be funny when you have to be clean.\nI wrote the story myself. It's all about a girl who lost her reputation but never missed it.\nIt ain't sin if you crack a few laws now and then, just so long as you don't break any.\nPersonality is the glitter that sends your little gleam across the footlights and the orchestra pit into that big black space where the audience is.\nGood girls go to heaven. Bad girls go everywhere else.\nI used to be Snow White, but I drifted.\nTen men waiting for me at the door? Send one of them home, I'm tired.\nOn desire: Sex is an emotion in motion....love is what you make it and who you make it with.\nI do all my writing in bed; everybody knows I do my best work there.\nTo err is human, but it feels divine.\nFew men know how to kiss well. Fortunately, I've always had time to teach them.\nI always save one boyfriend for a rainy day . . . and another in case it doesn't rain.\nWhy don't you come up sometime and see me? I'm home every evening . . . Come up, and I'll tell your fortune.\nI freely chose the kind of life I led because I was convinced that a woman has as much right as a man to live the way she does if she does no actual harm to society.\nThe man I don't like doesn't exist.\nI generally avoid temptation unless I can't resist it.\nIt isn't what I do, but how I do it. It isn't what I say, but how I say it, and how I look when I do it and say it.\nI'm not good and tired, just tired.\nMen are easy to get but hard to keep.\n[on style] It's all right for a perfect stranger to kiss your hand as long as he's perfect.\n[on love] A man's kiss is his signature.\n[on growth] He who hesitates is a damn fool.\nA dame that knows the ropes isn't likely to get tied up.\n[on Marilyn Monroe ] The only gal who came near to me in the sex appeal department was pretty little Marilyn Monroe . All the others had were big boobs.\nMy advice for those gals who think they have to take their clothes off to be a star is: baby, once you've boned, what's left to create an illusion? Let 'em wonder.I never believed in givin' 'em too much of me.\nI'm my own original creation. I concentrate on myself most of the time. That's the only way a person can become a star in the true sense. I never wanted a love that meant surrender of my self-possession. I saw what it did to other people when they loved another person the way I loved myself, and I didn't want that problem. I had to stay in command of my career.\n[on her popularity within the gay community] They're crazy about me 'cause I give 'em a chance to play. My character is sexy and with humor and they like to imitate me, the things I say, the way I say 'em, the way I move. It's easy for'em to imitate me 'cause the gestures are exaggerated, flamboyant, sexy, and that's what they want to look like, feel like. And I've stood up for 'em. They're good kids. I don't like the police abusin' 'em, and in New York I told 'em, 'When you're hittin' one of those guys, you're hittin' a woman, 'cause a born homosexual is a female in a male body.\nAlmost anything goes, anywhere, if it is good and fast and amusing. Risque material is only offensive if badly done, without style and charm. I brought my own sophisticated ideas and style to the vaudeville stage but I had to adjust it to the standard of each theatre, and even to each night's audience.. The theatre manager,if he was a man with experience and knew his business, could usually tell me what the people in town were like, and what the difference in audiences was on other nights.I usually found that one night a week you would get a top society crowd, and another night you'd get mostly working-class people. Other nights there would be family groups - especially on Friday nights when the kids didn't have to go to school the next day. Saturday nights everybody was out for a good time, so audiences were both mixed and terrific.\nBetween two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before.\nVirtue has its own reward, but has no sale at the box office.\nI was in the office at Paramount, and they gave me a large book with a lot of photographs of different leading men, and I was sitting at a table or a desk right near the window and the door, and uh, after I looked at a few I kind of glanced out the window and I saw this good-looking guy walk across the street. So, I said, \"That's about the best-looking thing in Hollywood: who is he?\" So they looked, and they said, \"Oh, that's Cary Grant. We haven't used him in a picture as yet, but we made tests of him with some of the starlets.\" I said, \"Well, if this guy can talk, I'll take him.\" So they called him in, and we met, and he said, \"How d'ya do?\" and I said, \"OK.\" And they said, \"What part?\" and I said, \"The lead, of course.\" So he got the lead.\n'Beulah peel me a grape'.\nSalary (5)\n\n"
