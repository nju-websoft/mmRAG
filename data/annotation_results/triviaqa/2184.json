But it doesn't; it has two ... but it's just the same as with any other animal. elephants have four knees - QI : Quite Interesting QI : Quite Interesting\nIf your knees aren't green by the end of the day, you ought to seriously re-examine your life.\nBILL WATTERSON\nKnees \nMAURICE CHEVALIER (1888-1972)\nWhen you hit 70 you sleep sounder, you feel more alive than when you were 30. Obviously it's healthier to have women on your mind than on your knees.\nElephant Knees\nWhat looks like the elephant's front knees are actually its wrists. There's a popular internet factoid which states that the elephant is the only animal which has four knees. But it doesn't; it has two knees at the back, and elbows and wrists at the front, exactly like other quadrupeds. Elephants, horses, dogs and all other quadruped mammals have two knees and two elbows. Almost all mammals have basically the same skeletal structure because we are descended from common ancestors.\nWhat you can see in the middle of a horse's front leg gets called the knee but is actually its wrist – a knee joins the femur (thighbone) and the tibia (shinbone) whereas a wrist joins the radius (forearm) and the carpus (the bit the digits are joined to). The bit between its body and the middle of the leg is the forearm. What we think of as the 'lower leg' is analogous to our third metacarpal - the bone linking our wrist to our middle finger. Horses walk around on the equivalent of their middle fingers.\nThere's a misconception that birds' knees bend in the wrong direction but it's just the same as with any other animal. Birds' legs look like they're backwards because we're actually looking at their ankles. Birds' knees are right by their bodies and normally covered by feathers, and their ankles are well off the ground. Their knees bend exactly like ours do.\nBees' Knees\nBees do have knees. They definitely have joints in their legs, and they have femurs and tibia – the bones which the knee joins in humans. They don't have kneecaps, however – so while the joints in bees' legs aren't quite 'knees' as we know them, they are still knees by our reckoning.\nIn the 18th century, saying something was 'no bigger than a bee's knee' used to mean it was very small. The modern phrase 'the bee's knees' seems just to have been a nonsense phrase. The world's smallest ever advertisement (promoting the Guinness World Records website) was a knee band which was fitted to a bee's knee in November 2000. It was the width of a human hair.\nCLEMENT FREUD (1924-2009) ON HIS ARTIFICIAL KNEES\nWhen propositioned recently by a woman to 'come upstairs and make love', I had to explain that it was one or the other.\nThe hollow behind your knee is called a hough.\nThe adjective 'geniculate' means 'bent like a knee'.\nTutankhamun's Knee\nIn 2005, a CAT scan of Tutankhamun's mummy showed that rather than being murdered by his brother, he may have died from an infected knee.\nKnee Jerk\nThe ‘knee-jerk’ reaction when you’re tapped on the knee with a hammer tests an interaction between the thigh muscle and the spinal cord, and does not involve the brain. As it’s a ‘mono-synaptic response’ (i.e. the impulse only has to jump from one nerve to another, once) there are very few variables in play, which is what makes it such a useful test.\n \nIt’s not just a matter of seeing if your leg twitches – it’s the relative strength of the twitch which is significant. Too much jerk might indicate a brain tumour, stroke, liver disease, low calcium, low magnesium, hypothermia, multiple sclerosis, pre-eclampsia, spinal chord lesion or tetanus. Too little might mean botulism, a damaged nervous system, Eaton-Lambert syndrome (weakness of arm and leg muscles), Guillain-Barre syndrome (nerve inflammation), polymyositis (severe muscle inflammation) or syringomyelia (spinal cysts).\n \nKnobbly Knees\nIn June 1947, Laurel and Hardy did a six-day gig at Butlins in Skegness. Part of the job was to judge the Knobbly Knees competition, in which elderly men with rolled-up trouser-legs were subjected to a series of humiliating tasks. They also joined their wives Ida and Lucille in judging the ‘Holiday Lovelies’ competition.\n \nThe knobbles on our knees are all different. It has been suggested that they may be as unique as irises and fingerprints – and research has started into the possibility of implementing an MRI scanner that works at knee-level for airport security systems.\nA cricket's ears are on its knees.\nThe knapper is another word for the knee.\nA person's knee takes a force the equivalent to three times their body weight with every step.\nIn ancient Greece, if something was ‘on the knees of the gods ’, meant that it was totally beyond human control or knowledge.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nThere are no animals that have 4 knees. ... but elephants are the same as all other quadruped mammals, like horses and dogs, in that they have knees only in the back ... How many animals have 4 knees? | Reference.com How many animals have 4 knees? | Reference.com\nHow many animals have 4 knees?\nA:\nQuick Answer\nThere are no animals that have 4 knees. All quadruped mammals have 2 knees at their back legs and then elbows and wrists at the front.\nFull Answer\nThere is a common misconception that elephants are the only animals that have 4 knees, but elephants are the same as all other quadruped mammals, like horses and dogs, in that they have knees only in the back legs.  Skeletal images clearly depict that the front leg joint bends in the same way as human elbows rather than knees.  In animals like the horse, the front joint that looks like a knee is more appropriately compared to a human wrist, making the long lower leg more comparable to the third metacarpal of a middle finger.  All mammals' skeletal structures are very similar due to the fact that they descend from common ancestors.\nIn addition, all tetrapods, which are all vertebrates with 4 limbs, and those animals whose ancestors had 4 limbs like snakes are also based on similar structures.  These common limbs all share 2 long bones that combine tarsal bones in the back and carpal bones in the front.  All of these limbs also have 5 digits.  Even in animals that have less than 5 digits, the 5 digits are present in embryonic state.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\nThey are the only animal with 4 knees, did you know that?
