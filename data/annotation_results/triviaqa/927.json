Flemington Racecourse & Races - Punters.com.au Flemington Racecourse & Races - Punters.com.au\n448 Epsom Rd, Flemington, 3031\nFlemington Races\nFlemington is renowned for its Spring Racing Carnival, which not only boasts the Melbourne Cup, Australia's most famous horse race, but it is also includes Derby Day, widely considered the most competitive race meeting in the country with an entire card of Group racing. Both of these events fall within the Melbourne Cup Carnival, which is the biggest week of racing on the Australian racing calendar. The carnival consists of four feature racedays conducted over the course of a week. These four meetings are (in order) Derby Day, Melbourne Cup Day, Oaks Days and Stakes Day.\nRacedays: Flemington will host 23 racedays throughout the course of the 2015/2016 racing season\nGroup Ones: Flemington will host 14 Group Ones\nThe Melbourne Cup\nEvery year on the first Tuesday in November, Flemington plays host to Australia's most famous horse race, the Melbourne Cup. The race permits up to 24 competitors to slug it out over a gruelling two miles, with the winner laying claim to the lion's share of the $6 million in prize money on offer. This prize pool makes the Melbourne Cup the richest handicap in the world.\nThe 2016 Melbourne Cup was held on Tuesday 31 November, with the Robert Hickmott-trained Almandin proving too good for his rivals, thanks in part to a brilliant steer from jockey Kerrin McEvoy.\nCheck out our Melbourne Cup page for more info!\nFlemington race distances and barrier info\n1000m - Races begin in the chute off the main straight. Barriers rarely come into play as it is a straight race from start to finish.\n1200m - Also started in the chute and thus also provide a straight race from start to finish.\n1400m - Begins in a chute on the opposite side of the course to the 1000 and 1200 metre races. The chute runs straight into the home turn and makes inside barriers greatly important.\n1600m - Inside barriers are of high importance over this distance as the short starting chute leads straight into the massive home turn, which finds the field spending more than half of the race on the turn\n1800m - No chute here, the race starts on the course's back straight and runners gallop for about 300 metres before hitting the home turn. Inside barriers are favoured.\n2000m - Commencing at the start of the back straight gives runners more time to jostle for position, but inside barriers are still at an advantage.\n2500m - The field jumps at the start just a small distance before the start finish post and the first turn. Getting out to these larger distances see inside barriers lose a bit of the advantage that may have been enjoyed in shorter races.\n3200m - Getting back to the chute on the home straight, these longer races start with gallop of about 1000 metres before the first turn is reached thus making the barriers of little or no importance.\nFeature Races\nStandish Handicap G3 Open hcp 1200m\nFebruary\nLightning Stakes G1 Open wfa 1000m\nC S Hayes Stakes G3 3YO C&G sw+p 1400m\nThe Vanity G3 3YO Fillies sw+p 1200m\nMarch\nAustralian Guineas G1 3YO Open sw 1600m\nFrances Tressady Stakes G3 4YO+ Mares sw+p 1400m\nAustralian Cup G1 Open wfa 2000m\nKewney Stakes G2 3YO Fillies sw 1400m\nVRC Sires Produce Stakes G2 2YO Open sw 1400m\nBlamey Stakes G2 3YO+ Open sw+p 1600m\nMatron Stakes G3 4YO+ Mares sw+p 1600m\nThoroughbred Breeders Stakes G3 2YO Fillies sw+p 1200m\nAugust\nAurie's Star Handicap G3 Open hcp 1200m\nSeptember\nMakybe Diva Stakes G1 Open Open wfa 1600m\nDanehill Stakes G2 3YO Open sw+p 1200m\nLet's Elope Stakes G2 4YO+ Mares sw+p 1400m\nBobbie Lewis Quality G3 Open qlty 1200m\nOctober\nTurnbull Stakes G1 4YO+ Open sw+p 2000m\nGilgai Stakes G2 Open sw+p 1200m\nEdward Manifold Stakes G2 3YO Fillies sw 1600m\nRose Of Kingston Stakes G2 4YO+ Mares sw+p 1400m\nOctober/November (Derby Day)\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nFlemington Racecourse is located ... held at Flemington Racecourse.

The racecourse is famous for the capacity crowds that pack into the grandstands for the running of the Melbourne Cup and the VRC Derby Stakes , with up to 120,000 spectators attending each event.\nLocated adjacent to the Maribyrnong River, Flemington Racecourse is also renowned for the scenic beauty of its grounds, which features one of the largest rose gardens in Australia. The racecourse is serviced by its own railway station, and is recognised as an Australian Heritage site on the Australian National Heritage List .\nRacetrack Layout and Description\nThe primary racetrack at Flemington Park covers a distance of 1.5 miles and is laid out in a pear shape. The unique shape of the racecourse requires jockeys and racehorses to navigate a tight corner on their way to the finishing post. The track also includes a ¾ of a mile straight.\nVariable weather conditions in Melbourne make ground predictions for major races at Flemington Park tricky. Ground conditions can rapidly shift from fast to heavy, which has a substantial impact on the outcome of races held there. The draw also has a significant impact on the results of races at Flemington Racecourse, with inside draws having a significant advantage over the wide draws.\nFlemington Racecourse also features a 3 mile diamond-shaped jumps racing course for winter racing.\nThe Genesis of Thoroughbred Racing in Victoria\nThe present site of Flemington Park Racecourse has been hosting horse races since the 19th century. Racing was first organised on the salt flats on the outskirts of Melbourne in the 1840s, on land leased from the local butcher, Robert Fleming.\nThe popularity of racing in the area grew rapidly, and within the space of a few years an informal settlement had grown up around the racetrack to service the needs of spectators and trainers. This area was named ‘Fleming’s Town’, a name that was retained by the Victorian Turf Club when they leased the ground in 1848.\nRacing at Flemington became even more popular during the Australian Gold Rush, with thousands of gold-prospectors wagering their spoils on the races held in Melbourne. Facilities improved steadily, and within decades Flemington Racecourse was recognised as the premier destination for racing fans in Melbourne.\nFlemington Racecourse has been upgraded at various times during its history. The most recent round of renovations focused on improving the drainage of the notoriously unpredictable Flemington turf, and the creation of additional seating to the already vast Flemington Park grandstands.\nBet365 Bonus Bundle\n\n"
