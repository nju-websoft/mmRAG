What a delightful spot. We toured the island on a horse and cart which was great fun and John our driver, who was born on the island, made our day a very special one. He had a wonderful sense of humour and filled us in on the history of the island. I would love to return and do the island on a bike next time.\nHelpful?\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\nprabedky\n“Worst experience in Ireland”\nReviewed June 13, 2010\nIn an overall wonderful trip to Ireland, I wasted a day going to Inishmore. For my wife and I the roundtrip ferry from Doolin cost 40 Euro. The trip out took about an hour and a half. You get off the ferry on a wharf crowded with too many other tourists all rushing to see what there is to see. And there is not much. First you pass rusing out ships in the harbor complete with rusting out oil drums on deck. You are immediately confronted with one after another hack trying to get you to rent a horse cart, a mini van, a mini bus or a bicycle to tour the island. We were confronted with probably 25 of these solicitations within the first 15 minutes of being off the boat. We were so disgusted we just decided to walk around awhile. And what I saw made me sick. There is horse dung all over the streets. They make no effort to keep the crap off the streets and do nothing to get it up. And you have to walk through it because there are no sidewalkds. And there is trash everywhere in the streets and along the edges of the roads. The people seem to have no pride in their property. The houses are run down, the grass and weeds are allowed to grow up without any effort to mow. And there are house trailers everywhere. There are a few small shops and some cafes, but nothing of any real interest. I never did take the tour. My wife did and apparently saw some interesting and unique sites. But I was so disgusted by what I saw, I would never consider going back to Inishmore. The trip back on the ferry was even longer. They can't seem to figure out how to make a trip from one point to another. Don't waste your time on Inishmore.\nHelpful?\n“Pubs in Kilronan Inishmore.”\nReviewed August 30, 2009\nA wonderful island with a great 'way out west' atmosphere.It is definately worth staying overnight to get a proper feel for the place.The highlight of theplace is without doubt Dun Aengus Fort overlooking a sheer drop (75metres)into the atlantic.A serious word of warning though, dont just walk out to the edge and look over, or sit on the edge with your legs over the side as I witnessed on my visit.There can be strong breezes up there!\nAnyway on to the pubs-I'm aware of 4 drinking establishments on the island at present, all in Kilronan.I will rate them in reverse order\n4. The Hotel-Not its fault, but you dont really expect the atmosphere of a cozy pub in a hotel lounge-I found the staff to be all friendly.\n3. American Bar-Looks good outside but disappoints a bit in atmosphere once you get inside-Girl behind bar working hard.\n2. Joe Mc's-good lively and friendly spot with a hostel beside it-The price of a pint of lager at €4.20 seems to be the standard on the island.\n1. Joe Wattys-Surrounded by trees and with a nice seating area outside on a grass lawn is definately the most inviting of all the pubs.It also does pub grub-mind you the food prices seem steep-however the dessert portions are very generous and really well presented. Music is nightly at 10.30 ish The staff are all extremely friendly and efficient.Price warning-Pint Bottles of cider are expensive at €5.50 on a recent visit-maybe the recent reductions in price by Bulmers hav'nt been implemented yet!!\nHelpful?\n“A group of young people visit Inis Mor”\nReviewed June 2, 2009\nWe visited Inis Mor this past weekend and found the island to be a beautiful part of the country - us all being Irish ourselves from various different parts. we stayed in the Artists hostel which was a great experience and was like having a house to ourselves - highly recommended and owners are very friendly and left us to our own devices unless we needed anything. we rented bikes and visited dun aengus which was definitely one of the best days i've had in a long time - the fab weather really added to the experience but the views from the fort itself are truly breathtaking.\nOn a negative side we found some people on the island to be somewhat unfriendly towards us. there seems to be a bad attitude among many of the islanders and we are unsure if this is because we were a large group of young people (in our early twenties) or is this an attititude held towards tourists in general. we found one of the publicans to be very rude towards us, one of the girls in our group was given out to for no reason by one of the ladies in a shop near dun aengus and we had a most unsatisfactory experience in a restaurant by the pier. we all really felt that the islanders need to be a bit more welcoming in their attitude to the people who are spending money on the island and providing them with a livelihood.\nHaving said this, the island is still well worth a visit.\nHelpful?\n\n\nDOCUMENT 2:\n\nI spent two nights on Inishmor, the largest of the Aran Islands, ...

Inishmor is by far the most touristy of the three, but almost everyone is a day-tripper and goes on a predictable tour route. If you get off the beaten track the isolation is amazing. Stay overnight, and after the last ferry leaves until the first one arrives the next morning, you'll have the island to yourself. I stayed at the Pier House, right at  the pier as the name implies, and a nice central place to explore the  island. \nThe beach and village of Kilronan\nKilronan Harbour at sunset\nThe eastern end of Inishmor from Dun Aengus\nDun Aengus is the best known of the ancient stone forts of Inishmor, but         it tends to be crowded with tour groups (unless you get there before the         first ferry arrives, as I did). \nA         short walk in the other direction from Dun Aengus out of Kilronan, the \"Black Fort\" (Dun         Dï¿½bhchathair) is almost unknown and unvisited, and, in my opinion, even         more interesting. After 3,000 years, it's still overlooking the sea on the northern coast of         Inishmor, at the end of an unmarked path across the bare limestone karst         moonscape.\nHarbour Seals are common in the waters around the Aran Islands\nThis curious little fellow came up to visit at Kilronan Quay\nThe Seven Churches is a monastic settlement on Inishmor\nThe island is covered by small fields surrounded by drystone         walls. \nThere are few, if any, gates on Inishmor. Instead, if you need to move\nlivestock in or out of a field, you just unbuild the wall to make a gate\nand rebuild it behind the cows\nThe Jaunting Cars meet every ferry and compete with the minibuses for         tourists\nAs with most of western Ireland, the population of the Aran Islands\nis a fraction of what it once was. Deserted homesteads can be found         across the islands.\nSanderlings on a beach west of Kilronan\nInisheer\nInisheer is the easternmost, and smallest, of the Aran Islands. At         only two miles across, it's easy to cover the island on foot. \nWe stayed at Brid Poill's B&B, and were greeted with the best         fresh-baked scones I've ever had. \n \nThe narrow, winding roads, bordered by high drystone walls, are perfect\nfor horse carts or tractors - and that's mostly what you find for         transport on Inisheer. When we got off the ferry we met this horse         carter, who asked where we were going - \"Brid's? That's a long         way... for 10 Euro I'll take you there\". Knowing full well what was         going on, I decided to take the Grand Tour, and we boarded the cart. We         went all around the eastern part of the island before arriving at our         B&B which, as I'd suspected, turned out to be less than a         five-minute walk from the pier. \nInisheer Quay, with the Doolin Ferry\n14th century O'Brien's Castle sits on the highest point on Inisheer,\ninside a prehistoric ring fort\nJust down the hill from O'Brien's Castle, the National School was built         in 1885 \nnext to the 1804 Signal Tower.

There are few tourist attractions and the season doesn't open until June         for the hotel and restaurant. The island's museum is now a woolen outlet         shop, and the only place for lunch is the village shop, which (at least         when I was there) was out of stock on guide books to the island. On the         upside, there are several marked walking routes which are great for         walking, and if you get lost, anyone you meet will be happy to take some         time and chat. And if you just want some solitude, there's world-class         quiet.  \nThe ferry ride from Rossaveal was exciting, with high winds and waves.         In about 45 minutes we made it to Inishmaan, and I was met at the pier         by Martin and his taxi to take me to Angela Faherty's Creig Mor B&B.         Angela's a great cook, which was good, since none of the other places to         eat on the island had opened for the season yet. \nInishmaan is divided in half - a low-lying area with the piers and         most of the houses, and a high plateau with two ring forts, the shop and         church, and little else. \nInishmaan cemetery\nAs with the other islands, fields are small and enclosed by drystone         walls\nWhere the islanders didn't build soil with seaweed and sand, it's still         just rock\nCliff view from Synge's Chair, a rock seat within a shielding wall, used         by playwright John Millington Synge.

The Aran Islands are a group of three islands located at the ... The Aran sweater first began to emerge in the early part of the ... Aran Islands Ireland Aran Islands Galway Aran Islands ... Aran Islands Ireland Aran Islands Galway Aran Islands Galway Ireland County Galway Aran Islands Co Galway\n \n \nThe Aran Islands are a group of three islands located at the                      mouth of Galway Bay off the west coast of Ireland.\nThe largest island is Inishmore also known as Aranmore. The                      middle and second-largest is Inishmaan and the smallest and                      most eastern is Inisheer . Irish is a spoken language on all                      three islands, and is the language used for the names of the                      islands and many of the island's villages and place names.\n \n \nApproximately 14 kms (8.7 miles) in length and 3.8 kms(2.4                      miles) in width, Inishmore is a walker's paradise. Feel the                      peace and listen to the silence, between sea and sky, on                      craggy cliffs or all along a quiet, indented coastline. Aran                      has an abundance of wildlife and some 437 varieties of wild                      flowers. If pedalling is your pleasure hire a bike in Kilronan village and meander at will around this lovely                      island or take a pony and trap, or a guided tour with a                      modern minibus, from the pier.\nVisiting Aran\nYou can travel to Aran by ferry boat, directly from Galway City Dockside (90  minutes), Ros a Mhil (Rossaveal) in Connemara (35 / 40 mins), Doolin in Co.  Clare (20 mins) or by air from Indreabhan (Inverin) under 10 mins.\nYou can cycle or see Aran on horseback along the pathways of        history on this unique island. Swim in unpolluted seas, study rare flowers and wildlife, write, paint, take pictures, fish for a specimen or just        relax, unwind and learn spoken Irish in this bilingual community. And when        the Celtic twilight comes, drop in for a quiet pint, or enjoy a wealth of        Irish music and dance, at a village or spontaneous session in an Island        pub.\n \nDun Aengus\nDun Aengus is a fort situated on the edge of a cliff at a height of 100 meters  overlooking the Atlantic on the Aran Islands, Inishmore, County Galway. It  consists of a series of concentric circular walls, the innermost; the citadel  encloses an area approximately 50 meters in diameter with 4m thick walls of  stone. These walls have been rebuilt to a height of 6m and have wall walks,  chambers, and flights of stairs as well. Two walls of stone that form  semicircles from one cliff edge to the other surround it. The innermost of these  two walls encloses an area approximately 130m by 100m, and the outer wall  encloses about 400m by 200m. (Flanagan 1992) Between the two \"outer walls\" is a  small enclosure that extends as if an extension to the first wall. The restored  walls are likely noticeable because of the use of mortar. The original walls  were of dry stone construction. In all the enclosed area is comprised of  approximately 14 acres.\nAran Sweaters\nThe Aran sweater first began to emerge in the early part of the twentieth  century. The events from which the modern Aran arose from the ashes of earlier  and less intricate designs are often debated, but it is reasonable to assume  that at least one circumstance had a profound effect on the Aran's evolution.  Aran women had always been knitting fisherman's jerseys, or 'ganseys', as  islanders call them, to help their husbands and families weather the  often-treacherous island conditions. However, during the last decade of the 19th  century a government motion to improve the economic livelihood of densely  populated rural areas began setting up lacemaking, knitting, and crochet schools  around the country. It is reported that artisans were sent from these schools  during the last years of the 19th century to teach Aran women how to knit  intricate patterns. In the years to follow the women of Aran combined their new  skills, artistic brilliance, and the traditions of life upon the sea to create  the sweaters we know today. Indeed, the very story of our lives is woven into  the sweater - every stitch has a meaning. For instance, there is the 'Ladder of  Life' stitch, which symbolizes the pilgrimage to happiness, the 'Tree of Life'  which grants good luck to its wearer, and even the stitch of 'Marriage Lines'  with zigzags that represent the ups and downs of married life.\nAran Heritage Centre\nA guided tour through the Centre will take you back more than two thousand years  in the life and times of the Aran Islands. Vivid exhibitions here will introduce  you to the landscape, traditions and culture of these harsh, yet beautiful  Atlantic Isles.\nThe Centre is some three minutes walk from the village of Kilronan. Step up from  the Ferryboat or the village and step into the essential Arainn, a window into  the lives and times of a resilient people. The Aran Centre vividly reveals the  art of curragh making (traditional island boat). Fishing helped the Aran  Islanders of past generations eke out a precarious living. The displays show how  the bare limestone was literally the bedrock on which they laid down layers of  sand, seaweed, and precious soil to nurture their tender crops.\nFamous People\n \nLiam ï¿½'Flaherty was born in 1897 in gGort na gCapall on the South coast of  Aran. He fought in the First World War and later spent several years travelling  the world before he published his first novel, Thy Neighbours Wife in 1923. His  short stories in both Irish & English are often based on beautifully captured  moments in the lives of the people, the animals and the elements of Aran.\nMï¿½irtï¿½n O'Dï¿½reï¿½in has been  called \"Ireland's unacknowledged poet Laureate\". He was born in 1910 in Sruthï¿½n  but left to work in Galway in 1928. His poems, most of which were inspired by  life on Aran were all written in Irish, but many have been translated into  English.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nPubs in Kilronan Inishmore. - Inishmore. ... and found the island to be a beautiful part of ... are unsure if this is because we were a large group of ...

Taking a trip to this Island is like stepping back in time. The roads are all lined with rock walls, and they are so narrow that 2 cars could not pass. There is a bar and supermarket downtown and a Cafe/Pub and a few shops near the fort.\nWe took the day trip over on the Ferry, it would be a good idea to take gravol before getting on the boat. I have never been motion sick in my life and I was green on the boat!! It is a rough ride across the ocean to the Island.\nWhen you arrive on the beach Mini Vans are waiting to take you for a tour of the Island, this was less than 10 Euros each. The guide took us up to the Fort, which has been standing there for over 2000 years, what an incredible view from the top of the cliff, and it is hard to believe that the Fort has been there since BC.\nThe tour also stops at Seven Churches.\nThe last boat leaves for the Island around 12 noon, and the last boat returns around 430 pm. There are a few Bed and Breakfasts and camping on the Island.\nIf you will be in the area don't miss this day trip, it is so amazing, my only regret is that I didn't have more time on the Island to appreciate its beauty!\n“Fantastic experience”\nReviewed 28 July 2008\nI was delightfully surprised by Inishmore, we had greta weather which made it all the more spectacular. Renting a bike is must, especially if you want to get around all the Island in 2 days, this still gives plenty of time to chill out, see the sights and enjoy a pint or two along the road. The musicans singing and playing outside Joe Watty's pub were an excellant relaxed treat on a sunny Sunday afternoon.\nThere are few signposts, but getting lost is all part of the fun, and you really cannot go that far wrong anyways. We had great fun cycling down some unsurfaced roads.\nWatch out for the fast cycling foreign students on day trips though.The flogging of typical and often nasty Irish souvenirs was dissappointing, but expected.\nAlso watch out for the fast driving mini-tour buses that carry day trippers, they often leave little room for the pedestrian or cyclist on the very narrow roads. I expect these drivers are just over for the summer and the noisy smokey diesel engines do take from the gentle scenery.\nOverall everybody was extremely nice, our B&B hosts were much more helpful than those normally found on the mainland.\nOh and one more thing Aran Island authorities, please get rid of the obnoxious Supermacs eyesore on the harbour front.\nHelpful?\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nInishmore House offers sight-seeing tours to the Aran Islands, ...

This is the first in a series of articles about Molly’s \"once in a lifetime\" experience, using photos, recollections and postings from her own blog, \"The Life of Molly: Adventures Abroad\", which she regularly wrote throughout her stay in Wales.)\nLast September was an exciting time for Molly Ammerman. Beginning the fall semester away from her familiar Central College campus surroundings was soon to become a rewarding experience for Molly. Studying abroad in Bangor, Wales was a \"once in a lifetime\" experience she will never forget. For three and a half months she called Bangor home; a town of approximately 13,000 people, of which, about 11,000 are students.\nSome of her course work mix included an Outdoor Pursuits class. Taught at the Conway Centre in Anglesey, an island off the coast of Bangor and separated by the Menai Strait, it is also where Prince William and Princess Kate have lived since they were married. \"But they were scheduled to move back to London within the next month, \" said Molly back in September.\n\"I understand that they really loved living in Wales and would engage themselves out in the community a lot,\" continued Molly. \"I know that last semester people in the (abroad) program saw Kate out grocery shopping a couple of times. How cool is that!\"\nExcited about her Outdoor Pursuits class, Molly was able to enjoy a wide assortment of outdoor activities, including canoeing, sea level traversing, mountain climbing, surfing, kayaking, Jorge scrambling, sailing, mountain biking and abseilling, to name a few. The class offered 17 different activities throughout the semester, all set in the beautiful landscape of Anglesey. It was an experience that Molly looked forward to including in her course work itinerary.\n\"This course worked with our schedule, in the sense, that it was taken one day a week, and was an all day class,\" explained Ammerman. The Pursuits class was also an optional course, whereas a class such as Welsh History was a required part of her course schedule.\nThe Welsh History class studied the history and past of Wales, and included lots of traveling and field trips. One of those \"field trips\" was a five day trip to Ireland (Sept. 11-15), where locales such as Cardiff, Liverpool and Chester were visited. This was one of the highlights of Molly’s semester.\nJust two days after settling into her new surroundings in Bangor, Molly was off to Dublin, Ireland for two nights. She visited the infamous Guinness Brewery, where she was able to \"build\" her own beer. Her group also visited many of the other Irish pubs throughout the city of Dublin. The city itself, however, did not impress Molly that much.\n\"I was disappointed in the city,\" she said, \"but I did enjoy the amazing Guinness Brewery and the Irish pubs. I even got to witness some real Irish music and folk dancing, which was quite entertaining, and made for a great night. I also got to pour my own pint of Guinness at the factory, and (even) received a certificate for doing it correctly. The taste (however) wasn’t my favorite, of course, but I managed to drink a few swigs before passing my pint on to the guys.\"\nAlso on the schedule were visits to Kilmainham jail, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the National Museum of Ireland, the Book of Kells at Trinity College and the Temple bar area.\nDay three in Ireland was spent in the \"wonderful\" city of Galway, and it certainly lived up to Molly’s expectations.\n\"Galway was the city I had imagined Ireland to look like, full of open fields,\" stated Molly. The day was spent exploring the beautiful Galway Cathedral, and they also walked around the harbor and admired the green landscape, as well as the breathtaking views overlooking the sea.\nInishmor was the next stop, which is the largest of the Aran Islands.\n\"This was one of my all time favorite days, as we rode around the island on our bikes,\" Molly continued. \"The most amazing part of the island was a place called Dun Aengus. This area contains famous prehistoric remains that are perched up on 600 foot cliffs above the sea. Luckily, we had an absolutely beautiful day, which glorified the beauty even more. This is certainly one day I will never forget.\"\nThe Cliffs of Moher occupied Molly and her group’s final day in Ireland on Sunday, September 15.\n\"The cliffs were incredible, like the Aran Islands, but the weather was crazy,\" commented Molly. \"I’ve never been pushed around by the wind so much. If I have ever been close to flying, this was the day. It was a neat experience in all, but made for a very long day, as we were on the bus driving most of the time.\"\nOn Monday, September 16, Molly’s group left Ireland and headed back to Wales, where they relaxed and enjoyed a nice dinner. It was also time to get settled in to their permanent housing arrangements, as classes were set to begin on September 30.\n\"I was busy unpacking and getting my flat ready for the semester,\" said Molly. \"The rooms were pretty nice and I enjoyed having my own room and bathroom. Also, I really looked forward to having my flat mates move in in a couple of days, and making some new Welsh friends, of course.\"\nIt was the end of a very exciting first week for Molly, as she started her second week by finally doing some laundry - in the kitchen sink! \"It’s very expensive to do laundry here,\" she said.\nMore \"field trips\" were scheduled for the next week, in and around Wales. And as Molly posted at the end of her first blog on September 17: \"I hope you will come along and enjoy this amazing experience with me!\"\nNext up: Exploring Castles and the Mountains.\nAbout Us\n\n\nDOCUMENT 7:\n\nBook Kilmurvey House, Aran Islands on TripAdvisor: ...
