The automobile was still evoking cries of “Get a horse!”. The airplane had yet to stay aloft for more that a few minutes, though the Wright brothers had shown a little more that a year earlier that heavier than air flight was possible. The first motion picture theater was soon to open in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with a film entitled “ The Great Train Robbery”. The ice cream cone had just appeared on the American scene, and the first concrete cantilever bridge was being built in Marion, Iowa. It was the year Einstein introduced his theory of relativity and James J. Jeffries retired as the world’s heavyweight boxing champion.\nIn Chicago, Illinois, on this particular February day, four men met in Room 711 of the Unity Building on Dearborn Street. They were Paul P. Harris, a lawyer, Silvester Schiele, a coal dealer, Gustavus E. Loehr, a mining engineer, and Hiram E. Shorey, a merchant tailor. The office of “Gus” Loehr was typical of its time – a small room, not too well lighted, with a desk and four uncomfortable chairs, a coat rack in the corner, one or two pictures and an engineering chart on the wall. They talked about the idea that Paul Harris had been pondering for five years. It was simply this: That business relations could, and should, foster friendly relations They need not, thought Paul Harris, be a barrier to friendship. What kind of men were these that Paul Harris had brought together? The founder of Rotary answered these questions in his book, This Rotarian Age, saying: “In the city by the lake, a drama was to be acted, the importance of which could not be foreseen. The dramatis personae were men of the ordinary walks of life: business and professional men.” “While lacking qualities which would have distinguished them from others of their kind, it may nevertheless be said that they were fairly representative of what in common parlance would have been termed ‘the better element’. They were all natural products of the times and subject to its usual frailties.”\n“All were friendly and congenial, and each represented a recognized and honorable vocation different from that of the others. They had been selected without regard to religious, racial or political differences.”\nAs these men talked that night in Room 711, they saw even more clearly that men in business could be personal friends – and should be. In their discussions of ways to foster such business/social relations, they decided, in agreement with Paul Harris, that the formation of the club might best serve their aims.\nThough they didn’t decide there and then to call it a Rotary Club, that meeting on the night of February 23, 1905 was the first meeting of the world’s first Rotary Club. The next day, a fifth member joined the group, having been invited to do so by Paul Harris. He was Harry Ruggles, a printer. He, in turn, interested a real estate dealer named Will Jenson. It was Ruggles who, at an early meeting one evening, jumped on a chair and shouted, “Let’s sing”! He liked to sing and it was his infectious enthusiasm for it that started the Rotary Clubs which today make singing part of their weekly program. Soon after Ruggles and Jenson came in, the organization of the new Club was completed at a meeting in Schiele’s office. The first president was Schiele, with Jenson as corresponding secretary, Shorey as recording secretary and Ruggles as treasurer.\nPaul Harris modestly declined to accept any office in the new Club at that time. In fact, it was not until 1907 that Harris was elected president of the Rotary Club of Chicago. The name “Rotary” was chosen at one of the early meetings, its proposer being Paul Harris, who pointed out that the word aptly conveyed the original plan of the members to meet “in rotation” at their various places of business.\nWith the name decided upon, Montague M. Bear, an engraver who had joined the Club, thought it was time to have an emblem. He came up with a sketch of a plain wagon wheel, a rotating symbol that won full approval. Today, “Monty” Bear’s wheel, though much changed in design, has hundreds of thousands of descendants in the form of the familiar cogwheel em- blem on the lapels of Rotarians across the world. The first printed roster of the Rotary Club of Chicago had 19 members, but at the end of 1905 there were 30 members. Paul Harris later wrote of these first members: “There were no drones in the 1905 group. Every one was interested and busy. Practically every member contributed some one or more serviceable ideas”. Several of these ideas are in operation today; for example the midday meeting, the practice of using photographs in rosters, the presentation of papers on vocational service subjects, and many others.\nSo began Rotary in the early 1900’s in the pioneer town of Chicago.Certainly, no Rotarian of 1905 ever dreamed that the idea set in motion in that Chicago office would some day be accepted by men and women around the world. Five years after Rotary’s birth, there were 16 Rotary Clubs and approximately 1,500 Rotarians. Within that same period, the organization became international with the formation of a Club in Winnipeg, Canada, in 1910. The first Rotary Convention was held in the Congress Hotel of Chicago in August, 1910. The National Association of Rotary Clubs was organized at that time with all 16 Clubs in membership. The following year, Clubs were organized in Ireland and England, and Rotary was on its global way. In 1912, the name was changed to International Association of Rotary Clubs. In 1916, the first Rotary Club in Ibero-America was functioning in Havana, Cuba; in 1919, the first in Asia in Manila, Philippines; in 1920, the first in continental Europe in Madrid, Spain; in 1921 the first in Africa in Johannesburg, Republic of South Af- rica; and in 1921, the first in Australia in Melbourne. The name Rotary International was adopted in 1922. Today, Rotary spans six continents with Clubs in more than eightscore countries.

Harris, an attorney who wished to capture in a professional club the same friendly spirit he had felt in the small towns of his youth. The Rotary name derived from the early practice of rotating meetings among members' offices.\nRotary's popularity spread, and within a decade, clubs were chartered from San Francisco to New York to Winnipeg, Canada. By 1921, Rotary clubs had been formed on six continents. The organization adopted the Rotary International name a year later.\nAs Rotary grew, its mission expanded beyond serving club membersï¿½ professional and social interests. Rotarians began pooling their resources and contributing their talents to help serve communities in need. The organization's dedication to this ideal is best expressed in its motto: Service Above Self.\nBy 1925, Rotary had grown to 200 clubs with more than 20,000 members. The organization's distinguished reputation attracted presidents, prime ministers, and a host of other luminaries to its ranks ï¿½ among them author Thomas Mann, diplomat Carlos P. Romulo, humanitarian Albert Schweitzer, and composer Jean Sibelius.\nThe Four-Way Test\nIn 1932, Rotarian Herbert J. Taylor created The Four-Way Test, a code of ethics adopted by Rotary 11 years later. The test, which has been translated into more than 100 languages, asks the following questions:\nOf the things we think, say or do\nIs it the TRUTH?\nIs it FAIR to all concerned?\nWill it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS?\nWill it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?\nRotary and World War II\nDuring World War II, many clubs were forced to disband, while others stepped up their service efforts to provide emergency relief to victims of the war. In 1942, looking ahead to the postwar era, Rotarians called for a conference to promote international educational and cultural exchanges. This event inspired the founding of UNESCO.\nIn 1945, 49 Rotary club members served in 29 delegations to the UN Charter Conference. Rotary still actively participates in UN conferences by sending observers to major meetings and covering the United Nations in its publications.\n\"Few there are who do not recognize the good work which is done by Rotary clubs throughout the free world,\" former Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Great Britain once declared.\nDawn of a new century\nAs it approached the 21st century, Rotary worked to meet societyï¿½s changing needs, expanding its service efforts to address such pressing issues as environmental degradation, illiteracy, world hunger, and children at risk.\nIn 1989, the organization voted to admit women into clubs worldwide and now claims more than 145,000 female members in its ranks.\nAfter the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Rotary clubs were formed or re-established throughout Central and Eastern Europe. The first Russian Rotary club was chartered in 1990, and the organization underwent a growth spurt for the next several years.\nMore than a century after Paul Harris and his colleagues chartered the club that eventually led to Rotary International, Rotarians continue to take pride in their history. In honor of that first club, Rotarians have preserved its original meeting place, Room 711 in Chicagoï¿½s Unity Building, by re-creating the office as it existed in 1905. For several years, the Paul Harris 711 Club maintained the room as a shrine for visiting Rotarians. In 1989, when the building was scheduled to be demolished, the club carefully dismantled the office and salvaged the interior, including doors and radiators. In 1993, the RI Board of Directors set aside a permanent home for the restored Room 711 on the 16th floor of RI World Headquarters in nearby Evanston.\nToday, 1.2 million Rotarians belong to over 32,000 Rotary clubs in more than 200 countries and geographical areas.\n  |\n\n\nDOCUMENT 3:\n\n* The Boys of 1905 - A History of Rotary International . ...

Harris, called three friends to a meeting. What he had in mind was a club that would kindle fellowship among members of the business community. It was an idea that grew from his desire to find within the large city the kind of friendly spirit that he knew in the villages where he had grown up.\nThe four businessmen didn’t decide then and there to call themselves a Rotary club, but their get-together was, in fact, the first meeting of the world’s first Rotary club. As they continued to meet, adding others to the group, they rotated their meetings among the members’ places of business, hence the name. Soon after the club name was agreed upon, one of the new members suggested a wagon wheel design as the club emblem. It was the precursor of the familiar cogwheel emblem now worn by Rotarians around the world. By the end of 1905, the club had 30 members. The second Rotary club was formed in 1908 half a continent away from Chicago in San Francisco, California. It was a much shorter leap across San Francisco Bay to Oakland, California, where the third club was formed. Others followed in Seattle, Washington, Los Angeles, California, and New York City, New York. Rotary became international in 1910 when a club was formed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. By 1921 the organization was represented on every continent, and the name Rotary International was adopted in 1922.\nThe Founder of Rotary\nPaul Harris, the founder of Rotary, was born in Racine, Wisconsin, USA, on April 19, 1868, but moved at the age of 3 to Wallingford, Vermont, to be raised by his grandparents. In the forward to his autobiography My Road to Rotary, he credits the friendliness and tolerance he found in Vermont as his inspiration for the creation of Rotary.\nTrained as a lawyer, Paul gave himself five years after his graduation from law school in 1891 to see as much of the world as possible before settling down and hanging out his shingle. During that time, he traveled widely, supporting himself with a great variety of jobs. He worked as a reporter in San Francisco, a teacher at a business college in Los Angeles, a cowboy in Colorado, a desk clerk in Jacksonville, Florida, a tender of cattle on a freighter to England, and as a traveling salesman for a granite company, covering both the U.S. and Europe.\nRemaining true to his five-year plan, he settled in Chicago in 1896, and it was there on the evening of February 23, 1905, that he met with three friends to discuss his idea for a businessmen’s club. This is commonly regarded as the first Rotary club meeting. Over the next five years, the movement spread as Rotary clubs were formed in other U.S. cities. When the National Association of Rotary Clubs held its first convention in1910, Paul was elected president.\nAfter his term, and as the organization’s only president-emeritus, Paul continued to travel extensively, promoting the spread of Rotary both in the USA and abroad. A prolific writer, Paul wrote several books about the early days of the organization and the role he was privileged to play in it. These include The Founder of Rotary, This Rotarian Age and the autobiographical My Road to rotary. He also wrote several volumes of Perigrinations detailing his many travels. He died in Chicago on January 27, 1947.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 4:\n\nThe ABCs of Rotary . ... and organizer of the first Rotary club in Chicago in 1905, ... there were 16 Rotary clubs, which linked up as an organization called the ...

That was well before their author, Cliff Dochterman, became president of Rotary International for the year 1992-93. Originally called \"Did Ya Know?\" the pieces were prepared to share interesting facts about Rotary International with members of the North Stockton club. Later, in response to requests from other Rotary clubs, the articles were reprinted in collected form. Now, President Cliff has brought the collection up to date in keeping with one of the emphases of his year in office as R.l. president--to help Rotarians learn more about the colorful history of their organization, its customs and traditions, and the current status of its global programs. The articles may be reprinted in Rotary club bulletins or presented as Rotary information at weekly club meetings.

There are so many characteristics of a Rotary club as well as the activities of a million Rotarians. There are the features of service, internationality, fellowship, classifications of each vocation, development of goodwill and world understanding, the emphasis of high ethical standards, concern for other people and many more descriptive qualities.\n \nIn 1976 the Rotary International Board of Directors was interested in creating a concise definition of the fundamental aspects of Rotary. They turned to the three men who were then serving on Rotary's Public Relations Commit- tee and requested that a one-sentence definition of Rotary be prepared. After numerous drafts, the committee presented this definition, which has been used ever since in various Rotary publications:\n \n\"Rotary is an organization of business and professional persons united worldwide who provide humanitarian service, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations and help build goodwill and peace in the world.\"\n \nThose 31 words are worth remembering when someone asks, \"What is a Rotary club?\"\n \nTHE OFFICIAL ROTARY FLAG\n \nAn official flag was formally adopted by Rotary International at the 1929 Convention in Dallas, Texas. The Rotary flag consists of a white field with the official wheel emblem emblazoned in gold in the center of the field. The four depressed spaces on the rim of the Rotary wheel are colored royal blue. The words \"Rotary\" and \"International\" printed at the top and bottom depressions on the wheel rim are also gold. The shaft in the hub and the keyway of the wheel are white.\n \nThe first official Rotary flag reportedly was flown in Kansas City, Missouri, in January 1915. In 1922 a small Rotary flag was carried over the South Pole by Admiral Richard Byrd, a member of the Winchester, Virginia, Rotary Club. Four years later, the admiral carried a Rotary flag in his expedition to the North Pole.\n \nSome Rotary clubs use the official Rotary flag as a banner at club meetings. In these instances it is appropriate to print the words \"Rotary Club\" above the wheel symbol, and the name of the city, state or nation below the emblem.\n \nThe Rotary flag is always prominently displayed at the World Headquarters as well as at all conventions and official events of Rotary International.\n \nROTARY'S WHEEL EMBLEM\n \nA wheel has been the symbol of Rotary since our earliest days. The first design was made by Chicago Rotarian Montague Bear, an engraver who drew a simple wagon wheel, with a few lines to show dust and motion. The wheel was said to illustrate \"Civilization and Movement.\" Most of the early clubs had some form of wagon wheel on their publications and letterheads. Finally, in 1922, it was decided that all Rotary clubs should adopt a single design as the exclusive emblem of Rotarians. Thus, in 1923, the present gear wheel, with 24 cogs and six spokes was adopted by the \"Rotary International Association.\" A group of engineers advised that the geared wheel was mechanically unsound and would not work without a \"keyway\" in the center of the gear to attach it to a power shaft. So, in 1923 the keyway was added and the design which we now know was formally adopted as the official Rotary International emblem.\n \nThe      first Rotary club meeting was in Chicago, Illinois, on February 23,1905.\nThe      first regular luncheon meetings were in Oakland, California, chartered in      1909.\nThe first      Rotary convention was in Chicago in 1910.\nThe      first Rotary club outside of the United States was chartered in Winnipeg,      Manitoba, Canada, in 1910.\nThe      first Rotary club outside of North America was chartered in Dublin, Ireland, in 1911.\nThe      first Rotary club in a non-English-speaking country was in Havana, Cuba,      in 1916.\nThe      first Rotary club in South America was chartered in Montevideo, Uruguay,      in 1918.\nThe      first Rotary club in Asia was chartered in Manila, Philippines, in 1919.\nThe      first Rotary club in Africa was chartered in Johannesburg, South Africa,      in 1921.\nThe      first Rotary club in Australia was chartered in Melbourne in 1921.      (original idea from \"Scandal Sheet\")\n \nOBJECT OF ROTARY\n \nIn some areas of the world weekly Rotary club meetings begin with all members standing and reciting the Object of Rotary. This statement, which comes from the Constitution of Rotary, is frequently seen on a wall plaque in Rotarians' offices or place of business. The Object of Rotary is \"to encourage and foster the ideal of service as a basis of worthy enterprise.\" The statement then lists four areas by which this \"ideal of service\" is fostered: through the development of acquaintance as the opportunity for service; the promotion of high ethical standards in business and professions; through\nservice in one's personal, business and community life; and the advancement of international understanding, goodwill and peace.\n \nThe Object of Rotary has not always been expressed in this manner. The original Constitution of 1906 had three objects: promotion of business interests, promotion of good fellowship and the advancement of the best interests of the community. By 1910 Rotary had five Objects as increased emphasis was given to expanding Rotary. By 1915 there were six Objects. In 1918 the Objects were rewritten again and reduced to four. Four years later they had again grown to six and were revised again in 1927.\n \nFinally, at the 1935 Mexico City Convention the six Objects were restated and reduced to four. The last major change came in 1951, when the \"Objects\" were streamlined and changed to a single \"Object\" which is manifested in four separate ways. The \"ideal of service\" is the key phrase in the Object of Rotary. This ideal is an attitude of being a thoughtful and helpful person in all of one's endeavors. That's what the Object truly means.\n \nROTARY MOTTOES\n \nThe first motto of Rotary International, \"He Profits Most Who Serves Best,\" was approved at the second Rotary Convention, held in Port- land, Oregon, in August 1911. The phrase was first stated by a Chicago Rotarian, Art Sheldon, who made a speech in 1910, which included the remark, \"He profits most who serves his fellows best.\" At about the same time, Ben Collins, president of the Rotary Club of Minneapolis, Minnesota, commented that the proper way to organize a Rotary club was through the principle his club had adopted--\"Service, Not Self.\" These two slogans, slightly modified, were formally approved to be the official mottoes of Rotary at the 1950 Convention in Detroit--\"He Profits Most Who Serves Best\" and \"Service Above Self.\" The 1989 Council on Legislation established \"Service Above Self\" as the principal motto of Rotary, since it best explains the philosophy of unselfish volunteer service.\n \n100 PERCENT ATTENDANCE\n \nRegular attendance is essential to a strong and active Rotary club. The emphasis on attendance is traced back to 1922 when Rotary International announced a worldwide attendance contest which motivated thousands of Rotarians to achieve a 100 percent attendance year after year. Many Rotarians take great pride in maintaining their 100 percent record in their own club or by making-up at other Rotary club meetings.\n \nAlthough the by-laws of Rotary require members to attend only 60 percent of all meetings, the custom has emerged that 100 percent is the desirable level. Rotary stresses regular attendance because each member represents his own business or profession and thus the absence of any member deprives the club of the values of its diversified membership and the personal fellowship of each member. From time to time, proposals have been made to give attendance credit to Rotarians who are on jury duty, serving in the community, attending a trade convention, on vacation in remote areas, on shipboard or unable to attend because of ill health or other special reasons. None of these exceptions has been adopted. The policy is very clear--a Rotarian is not given attendance credit if he does not attend a meeting.\n \nThere are a few circumstances where attendance credit is awarded when a Rotarian participates in an alternate type of Rotary event. If a Rotarian is requested to attend an Interact or Rotaract meeting, attendance credit may be allowed. When a member attends a Rotary district conference, district assembly, international convention, Council on Legislation, a meeting of an international committee, an inter-city meeting and a few other specially designated events, attendance my be credited. A Rotarian actively participating in a district-sponsored service project in a remote area where it is impossible to make-up may also receive attendance credit.\n \nTHE 4-WAY TEST\n \nOne of the most widely printed and quoted statements of business ethics in the world is the Rotary \"4-Way Test.\" It was created by Rotarian Herbert J. Taylor in 1932 when he was asked to take charge of the Chicago- based Club Aluminum Company, which was facing bankruptcy. Taylor looked for a way to save the struggling company mired in depression-caused financial difficulties. He drew up a 24-word code of ethics for all employees to follow in their business and professional lives. The 4-Way Test became the guide for sales, production, advertising and all relations with dealers and customers, and the survival of the company was credited to this simple philosophy. Herb Taylor became president of Rotary International during 1954-55. The 4-Way Test was adopted by Rotary in 1943 and has been translated into more than 100 languages and published in thousands of ways. The message should be known and followed by all Rotarians. \"Of the things we think, say or do: 1. Is it the TRUTH? 2. Is it FAIR to all concerned? 3. Will it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS? 4. Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?\"\n \nPAUL HARRIS--FIRST BUT NOT FIRST\n \nWas Paul Harris the first president of a Rotary club? No. Was Paul Harris the first president of Rotary International? Yes.\n \nThere is an easy explanation to this apparent contradiction. Although Paul Harris was the founder and organizer of the first Rotary club in Chicago in 1905, the man selected to be the first president was one of the other founding members, Silvester Schiele. By the year 1910 there were 16 Rotary clubs, which linked up as an organization called the National Association of Rotary Clubs. A couple of years later the name was changed to International Association of Rotary Clubs as Rotary was organized in Winnipeg, Canada, and then in England, Ireland and Scotland. In 1922 the name was shortened to Rotary International. When the first organization of Rotary clubs was created in 1910, Paul Harris was selected as the first president. He served in this position for two years from 1910 until 1912. thus, the founder of the Rotary idea, who declined to be president of the first club, became the first president of the worldwide organization, Rotary International.\n \nFIRST NAMES OR NICKNAMES\n \nFrom the earliest days of Rotary , members have referred to each other on a first-name basis. Since personal acquaintanceship and friendship are cornerstones of Rotary, it was natural that many clubs adopted the practice of setting aside formal titles in conversations among members. Individuals who normally would be addressed as Doctor, Professor, Mister, the Honorable or Sir are regularly called Joe, Bill, Charley or Jerry by other Rotarians. The characteristic Rotary club name badge fosters the first-name custom. In a few areas, such as Europe, club members use a more formal style in addressing fellow members. In other parts of the world, mainly in Asian countries, the practice is to assign each new Rotarian a humorous nickname which relates to some personal characteristic or which is descriptive of the member's business or profession. A member nicknames \"Oxygen\" is the manufacturer of chemical gas products. \"Trees\" is the nickname for the Rotarian in the lumber business, \"Building\" is the contractor, \"Paper\" is the stationery or office supply retailer. Other members might carry nicknames like \"Muscles,\" \"Foghorn\" or \"Smiles\" as commentaries on their physical features. The nicknames are frequently a source of good-natured fun and fellowship. But whether a Rotarian is addressed by a given first name or a nickname, the spirit of personal friendship is the initial step, which opens doors to all other opportunities for service.\n \nFOUR AVENUES OF SERVICE\n \nThe term \"four Avenues of Service\" is frequently used in Rotary literature and information. The \"Avenues\" refer to the four elements of the Object of Rotary: Club Service, Vocational Service, Community Service and International Service. Although the Avenues of Service are not found in any formal part of the constitutional documents of Rotary, the concept has been accepted as a means to describe the primary areas of Rotary activity.ï¿½ï¿½ \"Club Service\" involves all of the activities necessary for Rotarians to perform to make their club function successfully. \"Vocational Service\" is a description of the opportunity each Rotarian has to represent the dignity and utility of one's vocation to the other members of the club.\n \n\"Community Service\" pertains to those activities, which Rotarians undertake to improve the quality of life in their community. It frequently involves assistance to youth, the aged, handicapped and others who look to Rotary as a source of hope for a better life. The Fourth Avenue \"International Service\" describes the many programs and activities, which Rotarians undertake to advance international understanding, goodwill and peace. International Service projects are designed to meet humanitarian needs of people in many lands. When a Rotarian understands and travels down the \"Four Avenues of Service,\" the Object of Rotary takes on even greater meaning.\n \nTHE ROTARIAN AND REGIONAL MAGAZINES\n \nThe month of April is annually designated as \"Rotary's Magazine Month,\" an occasion to recognize and promote the reading and use of the official R.I. magazine, THE ROTARIAN, and the regional magazines. THE ROTARIAN has been around since 1911 as the medium to communicate with Rotarians and to advance the program and Object of Rotary. A primary goal of the magazine is to support the annual theme and philosophy of the R.I. president and to disseminate information about new and special programs, major meetings and the emphasis of the several official \"months\" of Rotary THE ROTARIAN provides a forum in which both Rotary-related and general interest topics may be explored. Frequently the magazine presents lively debates on topical questions. The magazine serves as an excellent source of information and ideas for programs at Rotary club meetings and district conferences. Many articles promote international fellowship, goodwill and understanding. Regular readers usually have superior knowledge of the activities of Rotary and how each Rotarian may be more fully involved in the Four Avenues of Service around the world. In addition to THE ROTARIAN there are 27 regional magazines printed in 21 languages. Although each regional publication has its own unique style and content, they all provide Rotarians with up-to-date information and good reading in April--and all through the year.\n \nINTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF A ROTARIAN\n \nAs an international organization, Rotary offers each member unique opportunities and responsibilities unlike those of other groups one might join. Although each Rotarian has first responsibility to uphold the obligations of citizenship of his or her own country, membership in Rotary enables Rotarians to take a somewhat different view of international affairs. In the early 1950s a Rotary philosophy was adopted to describe how a Rotarian may think on a global basis. Here is what it said: \"A world-minded Rotarian:\n \nLooks      beyond national patriotism and considers himself as sharing responsibility      for the advancement of international understanding, goodwill and peace;\nResists      any tendency to act in terms of national or racial superiority;ï¿½\nSeeks      and develops common grounds for agreement with peoples of other      lands;ï¿½\nDefends      the rule of law and order to preserve the liberty of the individual so      that he may enjoy freedom of thought, speech and assembly, and freedom      from persecution, aggression, want and fear;\nSupports      action directed toward improving standards of living for all peoples,      realizing that poverty anywhere endangers prosperity everywhere;ï¿½\nUpholds      the principles of justice for mankind;ï¿½\nStrives      always to promote peace between nations and prepares to make personal      sacrifices for that ideal;ï¿½\nUrges      and practices a spirit of understanding of every other man's beliefs as a      step toward international goodwill, recognizing that there are certain      basic moral and spiritual standards which will ensure a richer, fuller      life.\n\" That is quite an assignment for any Rotarian to practice in thoughts and      actions!\n \nSTANDARD CLUB CONSTITUTION\n \nRotary International is the most territorial organization in the world. It exists in 184 different countries and territories and cuts across dozens of languages, political and social structures, customs, religions and traditions. How is it that all of the more than 25,500 Rotary clubs of the world operate in almost identical style? The primary answer is the Standard Rotary Club Constitution. One of the conditions to receive a charter to become a Rotary club is to accept the Standard Club Constitution, originally adopted in 1922. The Standard Club Constitution outlines administrative techniques for clubs to follow in holding weekly meetings, procedures for membership and classifications, conditions of attendance and payment of dues and other policies relating to public issues and political positions. This constitutional document provides the framework for all Rotary clubs in the world. When the Standard Club Constitution was accepted, it was agreed that all existing clubs could continue to follow their current constitution. Although most of those early clubs have subsequently endorsed the Standard Constitution, a few pre-1922 clubs still conduct their club affairs according to their former constitutional provisions. The Standard Club Constitution has to be considered one of the great strengths of Rotary to enable the organization to operate in so many thousands of communities.\n \nTHE SPONSOR OF A NEW MEMBER\n \nThe bylaws of Rotary clearly outline the procedure for a prospective member to be proposed for Rotary club membership. The \"proposer\" is the key person in the growth and advancement of Rotary. Without a sponsor, an individual will never have the opportunity to become a Rotarian. The task of the proposer should not end merely by submitting a name to the club secretary or membership committee. Rotary has not established formal responsibilities for proposers or sponsors; however, by custom and tradition these procedures are recommended in many clubs. The sponsor should:\n \nInvite      a prospective member to several meetings prior to proposing the individual      for membership.\nAccompany      the prospective new member to one or more orientation/informational      meetings.\nIntroduce      the new member to other club members each week for the first month.\nInvite      the new member to accompany the sponsor to neighboring clubs for the first      make-up meeting to learn the process and observe the spirit of fellowship.\nAsk      the new member and spouse to accompany the sponsor to the club's social      activities, dinners or other special occasions.\nUrge      the new member and spouse to attend the district conference with the      sponsor.\nServe      as a special friend to assure that the new member becomes an active      Rotarian. When the proposer follows these guidelines, Rotary becomes      stronger with each new member\n \nWOMEN IN ROTARY\n \nUntil 1989, the Constitution and By-laws of Rotary International stated that Rotary club membership was for males only. In 1978 the Rotary Club of Duarte, California, invited three women to become members. The R.I. board withdrew the charter of that club for violation of the R.I. Constitution. The club brought suit against R.I. claiming a violation of a state civil rights law, which prevents discrimination of any form in business establishments or public accommodations. The appeals court and the California Supreme Court supported the Duarte position that Rotary could not remove the club's charter merely for inducting women into the club. The United States Supreme Court upheld the California court indicating that Rotary clubs do have a \"business purpose\" and are in some ways public-type organizations. This action there- fore allowed women to become Rotarians in any jurisdiction having similar \"public accommodation\" statutes. The R.l. constitutional change was made at the 1989 Council on Legislation, with a vote to eliminate the \"male only\" provision for all of Rotary.\n \nR.I. WORLD HEADQUARTERS\n \nThe headquarters of Rotary International always has been in the area of Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. First it was in Chicago itself, but in 1954 an attractive new building opened in suburban Evanston. The Ridge Avenue building met the needs of the Rotary Secretariat until the 1980s when the addition of new programs, the growth of The Rotary Foundation, and the new PolioPlus activities made the headquarters building extremely crowded and required some staff members to be housed in supplementary office space nearby. When a modern 18-story office building became available in downtown Evanston in 1987, it appeared to meet all of Rotary's space and expansion needs for years to come. The glass and steel structure, built in 1977, provides 400,000 square feet of office and usable space. The building was purchased by Rotary International, which leases approximately two-thirds of the space to commercial tenants, until needed by future Rotary growth. The building provides a 190-seat auditorium, large parking garage and 300-seat cafeteria, as well as functional office space for the 400 employees of the world headquarters. The executive suite on the 18th floor includes conference rooms for the R.I. board and committee meetings, in addition to the offices for the R.I. president, president-elect and general secretary. One Rotary Center, as it is called, will enhance the efficient operations of Rotary International for many years to come.\n \nMORE ROTARY FIRSTS\n \nRotary      became bilingual in 1916 when the first club was organized in a      non-English- -speaking country--Havana, Cuba.\nRotary      established the \"Endowment Fund\" in 1917, which became the      forerunner of The Rotary Foundation.\nRotary      first adopted the name \"Rotary International\" in 1922 when the      name was changed from the International Association of Rotary Clubs.\nRotary      first established the Paul Harris Fellows recognition in 1957 for      contributors of $1,000 to The Rotary Foundation.\nThe      Rotary club which first held meetings on a weekly basis was Oakland,      California, the Number 3 club.\nThe      Rotary emblem was printed on a commemorative stamp for the first time in      1931 at the time of the Vienna Convention.\nThe      first Rotary club banner (from the Houston Space Center) to orbit the moon      was carried by astronaut Frank Borman, a member of that club.\nThe      first Rotary International convention held outside the United States was      in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1921.\nThe      first head of state to address a Rotary convention was U.S. President      Warren G. Harding in 1923 at St. Louis.\n \nWORLD UNDERSTANDING MONTH\n \nThe month of February is very special in the Rotary calendar since it is designated World Understanding Month. The month also includes the anniversary of the first meeting of Rotary held on February 23, 1905, now designated World Understanding and Peace Day. In designating World Understanding Month, the Rotary International board asks all Rotary clubs to plan programs for their weekly meetings and undertake special activities to emphasize \"understanding and goodwill as essential for world peace.\" To observe this designated month, many clubs arrange international speakers, invite youth exchange students and international scholars from schools and universities to club meetings, plan programs featuring former Group Study Exchange team members, arrange discussions on international Issues, present entertainment with an international cultural or artistic theme and schedule other programs with an international emphasis. Many clubs take the opportunity to launch an international community service activity or make contact with a Rotary club in another country. It is a good month to initiate a Rotary Fellowship Exchange, a 3-H project or encourage support for PolioPlus and other Rotary Foundation programs. World Understanding Month is a chance for every club to pause, plan and promote the Fourth Avenue of Service--Rotary's continued quest for goodwill, peace and understanding among people of the world.\n \nROTARY AWARD FOR WORLD UNDERSTANDING\n \nSince 1981, the Rotary Award for World Understanding has been given each year, with one exception, to an individual or organization \"whose life or work demonstrates in some exemplary or worthy manner the Rotary ideal of service, especially in the promotion of international understanding, goodwill and peace.\" The award is presented at the Rotary International Convention. A special worldwide committee makes the selection, which must then be approved by the R.I. Board of Directors and the Trustees of The Rotary Foundation. In addition to a beautiful crystal sculpture, the award provides the opportunity for the recipient to select ten Rotary Foundation scholars who then receive their ambassadorial scholarships in the distinguished award winner's name. Past recipients of the World Understanding Awards have been: 1981, Dr. Noburo Iwamura, Japanese professor of medical research; 1982, Pope John Paul II; 1983, Dr. Lotta Hitschmanova, Canadian humanitarian; 1984, World Organization of the Scout Movement; 1985, Dr. Albert B. Sabin, developer of oral polio vaccine; 1986, International Committee of the Red Cross; 1987, Lady Hermione Ranfurly, for worldwide Ranfurly Library Services; 1988, The Salvation Army; 1989, no award; 1990, Vaclav Havel, president of Czechoslovakia; 1991, Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary general of the United Nations; and 1992, Edward J. Piszek, U.S.A. businessman-philanthropist.\n \nTHE CLASSIFICATION PRINCIPLE\n \nVirtually all membership in Rotary is based upon a \"classification.\" Basically a classification describes the distinct and recognized business or professional service which the Rotarian renders to society. The principle of Rotary classification is somewhat more specific and precise. In determining the classification of a Rotarian it is necessary to look at the \"principal or recognized business or professional activity of the firm, company or institution\" with which an active member is connected or \"that which covers his principal and recognized business or professional activity.\" It should be clearly understood that classifications are determined by activities or services to society rather than by the position held by a particular individual. In other words, if a person is the president of a bank, he is not classified as \"bank president\" but under the classification \"banking.\" It is the principal and recognized activity of a business or professional establishment or the individual's principal and recognized business or professional activity that determines the classification to be established and loaned to a qualified person. For example, the permanently employed electrical engineer, insurance adjustor, or business manager of a railroad company, mining company, manufacturing concern, hospital, clinic, etc., may be considered for membership as a representative of the particular work he may be doing personally or as a representative of the firm, company, or institution to which he is devoting his professional services. The classification principle also permits business and industries to be separated into distinct functions such as manufacturing, distributing, retailing and servicing. Classifications may also be specified as distinct and independent divisions of a large corporation or university within the club's territory, such as a school of business or a school of engineering. The classification principle is a necessary concept in assuring that each Rotary club represents a cross section of the business and professional service of the community.\n \nEXCHANGE OF CLUB BANNERS\n \nOne of the colorful traditions of many Rotary clubs is the exchange of small banners, flags or pennants. Rotarians traveling to distant locations often take banners to exchange at \"make up\" meetings as a token of friendship. Many clubs use the decorative banners they have received for attractive displays at club meetings and district events. The Rotary International board recognized the growing popularity of the banner exchange back in 1959 and suggested that those clubs which participate in such exchanges give careful thought to the design of their banners in order that they be distinctive and expressive of the community and country of which the club is a part. It is recommended that banners include pictures, slogans or designs which portray the territorial area of the club. The board was also mindful of the financial burden such exchanges may impose upon some clubs, especially in popular areas where many visitors make up and request to exchange. In all instances, clubs are cautioned to exercise discretion and moderation in the exchange of banners in order that the financial obligations do not interfere with the basic service activities of the club. Exchanging club banners is a very pleasant custom, especially when a creative and artistic banner tells an interesting story of community pride. The exchange of banners is a significant tradition of Rotary and serves as a tangible symbol of our international fellowship.\n \nNON-ATTENDANCE RULES\n \nThe Rotary Club Constitution specifies three conditions under which a Rotarian's membership will automatically be terminated for non-attendance. These circumstances are: failure to attend or make up four consecutive club meetings, failure to attend or make up 60 percent of club meetings each six months and failure to attend at least 30 percent of the meetings of one's own club in each six-month period. Under any of these three cases, a member will lose his Rotary membership unless the club board of directors has previously consented to excuse such failure for good and sufficient reason. To some individuals, these rules may seem unusually rigid. How- ever, being present at club meetings is one of the basic obligations a member accepts upon joining a Rotary club. The constitutional rules merely emphasize that Rotary is a participatory organization which highly values regular attendance. When a member is absent the entire club loses the personal association with that member. Being present at a club meeting is considered a vital part of the operation and success of every Rotary club. For any Rotarian to miss four consecutive meetings, or disregard the other attendance requirements, should be considered tantamount to the submission of one's resignation from the club. When a club terminates a member for non-attendance, it is simply an acceptance of a resignation and not a punitive action by the club officers. All Rotarians know the consequences of non-attendance, so it clearly becomes a conscious decision by a Rotarian to withdraw from the club when he fails to fulfill the attendance requirements.\n \nSHARING ROTARY WITH NEW MEMBERS\n \nAre you aware of the responsibility or obligation most Rotarians fail to perform? Paying their dues? Attending meetings? Contributing to the club's service fund? Participating in club events and projects? No--none of these! Of all the obligations a person accepts when joining a Rotary club, the one in which most Rotarians fail is \"sharing Rotary.\" The policies of Rotary International clearly affirm that every individual Rotarian has an \"obligation to share Rotary with others and to help extend Rotary through proposing qualified persons for Rotary club membership.\" It is estimated that less than 30 percent of the members of most Rotary clubs have ever made the effort to propose a new member. Thus, in every club, there are many Rotarians who readily accept the pleasures of being a Rotarian without ever sharing that privilege with another qualified individual. The Rotary policy on club membership states: \"In order for a Rotary club to be fully relevant to its community and responsive to the needs of those in the community, it is important and necessary that the club include in its membership all fully qualified prospective members located within its territory. \" One merely has to glance through the yellow pages of the local telephone directory to realize that most clubs have not invited qualified members of all businesses and professions into Rotary. Only a Rotarian may propose a customer, neighbor, client, supplier, executive, relative, business associate, professional or other qualified person to join a Rotary club. Have you accepted your obligation to share Rotary? The procedures are very simple, and everyone must know at least one person who should belong to Rotary.\n \nTOLERANCE OF DIFFERENCES\n \nOccasionally there is a temptation to criticize the laws, customs and traditions of another country which may seem strange or contrary to our own. In some instances illegal practices or customs of one nation are completely lawful and acceptable in another. As members of an international organization dedicated to world understanding and peace, it behooves Rotarians to exercise restraint in judging our Rotary friends and citizens from other countries when their behavior seems unusual to us. A Rotary policy has existed for more than half a century relating to this dilemma of international relationships. The statement, adopted in 1933, says that because it is recognized that some activities and local customs may be legal and customary in some countries and not in others, Rotarians should be guided by this admonition of tolerance: \"Rotarians in all countries should recognize these facts and there should be a thoughtful avoidance of criticism of the laws and customs of one country by the Rotarians of another country.\" The policy also cautions against \"any effort on the part of Rotarians of one country to interfere with the laws or customs of another country.\" As we strive to strengthen the bonds of understanding, goodwill and friendship, these policies still provide good advice and guidance.\n \nVOCATIONAL SERVICE\n \nVocational Service is the \"Second Avenue of Service.\" No aspect of Rotary is more closely related to each member than a personal commitment to represent one's vocation or occupation to fellow Rotarians and to exemplify the characteristics of high ethical standards and the dignity of work. Programs of vocational service are those, which seek to improve business relations while improving the quality of trades, industry, commerce and the professions. Rotarians understand that each person makes a valuable contribution to a better society through daily activities in a business or profession. Vocational service is frequently demonstrated by offering young people career guidance, occupational information and assistance in making vocational choices. Some clubs sponsor high school career conferences. Many recognize the dignity of employment by honoring exemplary service of individuals working in their communities. The 4-Way Test and other ethical and laudable business philosophies are often promoted among young people entering the world of work. Vocational talks and discussion of business issues are also typical vocational service programs at most clubs. Regardless of the ways that vocational service is expressed, it is the banner by which Rotarians \"recognize the worthiness of all useful occupations\" and demonstrate a commitment to \"high ethical standards in all businesses and professions.\" That's why the Second Avenue of Service is fundamental to every Rotary club.\n \nï¿½ ROTARY ANNS\n \nIn many Rotary clubs throughout the world, wives of male members are affectionately called \"Rotary Anns.\" This designation was never one of disparagement, but rather grew out of an interesting historical occasion. The year was 1914 when San Francisco Rotarians boarded a special train to attend the Rotary convention being held in Houston. In those days few wives attended Rotary events, and until the train stopped in Los Angeles, the only woman aboard was the wife of Rotarian Bru Brunnier. As the train picked up additional convention-bound delegates, Mrs. Ann Brunnier was introduced as the Rotarian's Ann. This title soon became \"Rotary Ann.\" Since the clubs of the West were inviting the Rotarians to hold their next convention in San Francisco, a number of songs and stunts were organized which would be performed in Houston. One of the Rotarians wrote a \"Rotary Ann\" chant. On the train's arrival at the Houston depot, a delegation greeted the West Coast Rotarians. One of the greeters was Guy Gundaker of Philadelphia, whose wife was also named Ann. During the rousing demonstration, someone started the Rotary Ann chant. The two petite ladies, Ann Brunnier and Ann Gundaker, were hoisted to the men's shoulders and paraded about the hall. The group loved the title given to the two women named Ann. Immediately the same term of endearment was used for all of the wives in attendance, and the name \"Rotary Ann\" was here to stay. Guy Gundaker became president of Rotary International in 1923 and Bru Brunnier was elected president in 1952. Thus, each of the two original Rotary Anns became the \"first lady of Rotary International.\"\n \nLESSONS IN ROTARY GEOGRAPHY\n \nWere you      aware that the Rotary Club of Reno, Nevada, is farther west than the      Rotary Club of Los Angeles, California?\nWould      you guess that the meetings of the Rotary Club of Portland, Maine, are      farther south than those of the clubs in London, England?\nCan      you imagine that the Pensacola, Florida, Rotary Club is west of the      Detroit, Michigan, club?\nIt's      a fact that the Cairo, Illinois, Rotary Club is south of Richmond,      Virginia.\nThere      are 69 Rotary clubs with the word \"Tokyo\" in their club names.\nThe      Rotary Club of Nome, Alaska, lies west of the club in Honolulu, Hawaii,      and the Santiago, Chile, club is located east of the Rotary Club of      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nRotary      geographers will know that virtually every Rotary club meeting in      Australia is east of the Hong Kong Rotary Club.\nWhat      do the Rotary clubs of Quito, Ecuador, Libreville, Gabon, Singapore, and      Kampala, Uganda, have in common? You guessed right if you said they all      meet approximately on the equator.\nThere      are many interesting relationships and things to learn as you become      acquainted with the 25,600 clubs in the wide world of Rotary.\n \nINVOCATIONS AT CLUB MEETINGS\n \nIn many Rotary clubs, particularly in Judeo-Christian nations, it is customary to open weekly meetings with an appropriate invocation or blessing. Usually such invocations are offered without reference to specific religious denominations or faiths. Rotary policy recognizes that throughout the world Rotarians represent many religious beliefs, ideas and creeds. The religious beliefs of each member are fully respected, and nothing in Rotary is intended to prevent each individual from being faithful to such convictions. At international assemblies and conventions, it is traditional for a silent invocation to be given. In respect for all religious beliefs and in the spirit of tolerance for a wide variety of personal faiths, all persons are invited to seek divine guidance and peace \"each in his own way.\" It is an inspiring experience to join with thousands of Rotarians in an international \"silent prayer\" or act of personal devotion. Usually all Rotary International board and committee meetings begin with a few moments of silent meditation. In this period of silence, Rotary demonstrates respect for the beliefs of all members, who represent the religions of the world. Since each Rotary club is autonomous, the practice of presenting a prayer or invocation at club meetings is left entirely to the traditions and customs of the individual club, with the understanding that these meeting rituals always be conducted in a manner, which will respect the religious convictions and faiths of all members.\n \nOPPORTUNITIES FOR FELLOWSHIP\n \nMost Rotarians are successful professional and business executives because they hear opportunities knock and take advantage of them. Once a week the opportunity for Rotary fellowship occurs at each club meeting, but not all members hear it knocking. The weekly club meeting is a special privilege of Rotary membership. It provides the occasion to visit with fellow members, to meet visitors you have not known before, and to share your personal friendship with other members. Rotary clubs, which have a reputation of being ï¿½friendly clubsï¿½ usually, follow a few simple steps: First, members are encouraged to sit in a different seat or at a different table each week. Second, Rotarians are urged to sit with a member they may not know as well as their long-time personal friends. Third, members invite new members or visitors to join their table just by saying: \"Come join us, we have an empty chair at this table.\" Fourth, members share the conversation around the table rather than merely eating in silence or talking privately to the person next to them. Fifth, Rotarians make a special point of trying to get acquainted with all members of the club by seeking out those they may not know. When Rotarians follow these five easy steps, an entirely new opportunity for fellowship knocks each week. Soon Rotarians realize that warm and personal friendship is the cornerstone of every great Rotary club.\n \nSENIOR ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP\n \nSenior active\" is a form of membership reserved for members who have provided substantial years of service to Rotary and is usually regarded as a mark of Rotary distinction. Being a senior active member signifies that a Rotarian has been involved in club activities over a long period. A Rotarian automatically becomes \"senior active\" upon completion of 15 years of service in one or more Rotary clubs. Senior active status is also conferred upon a Rotarian with ten or more years service who has reached the age of 60, or with five or more years service who has reached the age of 65. A Rotarian who serves as a district governor is also eligible for senior active membership. One of the benefits of being senior active is that the Rotarian no longer must reside or have his place of business within the territorial limits of the club. If a senior active member moves to another city, he may be invited to join Rotary without having an open classification. When a Rotarian becomes senior active, his/her classification is released to enable another individual to join Rotary. It is important to remember, senior active is not a classification it is a type of membership. A senior active member is always identified by \"former classification,\" which describes a business or profession.\n \nHONORARY MEMBERSHIP\n \nHonorary\" is one of the four types of membership a person may have in a Rotary club. This type of membership is the highest distinction a Rotary club can confer and is exercised only in exceptional cases to recognize an individual for unusual service and contributions to Rotary and society. An honorary member is elected for one year only, and continuing membership must be renewed annually. Honorary members cannot propose new members to the club, do not hold office and are exempt from attendance requirements and club dues. Many distinguished heads of state, explorers, authors, musicians, astronauts and other public personalities have been honorary members of Rotary clubs, including King Gustaf of Sweden, King George VI of England, King Badouin of Belgium, King Hassan III of Morocco, Sir Winston Churchill, humanitarian Albert Schweitzer, Charles Lindberg, composer Jean Sibelius, explorer Sir Edmund Hillary, Thor Heyerdahl, Thomas Edison, Walt Disney, Bob Hope, Dr. Albert Sabin, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and many of the presidents of the United States. Truly, those selected for honorary membership are those who have done much to further the ideals of Rotary.\n \nMEMBERSHIP IN ROTARY INTERNATIONAL\n \nIf you asked a Rotarian if he or she belonged to Rotary International, the individual probably would look puzzled and answer, \"Of course I'm a member of Rotary International.\" But in this instance, the confident Rotarian would be technically wrong. No Rotarian can be a member of Rotary International! The explanation of this apparent contradiction is simple. The constitutional documents of R.I. state that membership in Rotary International is limited to Rotary clubs. Over 25,600 Rotary clubs belong to the organization we call Rotary International. A Rotary club is composed of persons with the appropriate qualifications of good character and reputation, a business or professional classification and who serve in an executive or managerial capacity. The Rotarian belongs to a club--the club belongs to Rotary International. This technical distinction is not obvious or even known to most Rotarians and seldom does it create any problems or complications. It does explain, however, why the Rotary International Board of Directors places expectations upon and extends privileges to Rotary clubs, rather than to individual Rotarians. If someone asks if you belong to Rotary International, your most accurate answer would be, \"No, I belong to a Rotary club.\" But I doubt if anyone would understand the difference, or, in fact, would really care.\n \nDISTRICT GOVERNOR\n \nThe Rotary district governor performs a very significant function in the world of Rotary. He or she is the single officer of Rotary International in their geographic area, called a Rotary district, which usually includes about 45 Rotary clubs. The 500 district governors, who have been extensively trained at the worldwide International Assembly, provide the \"quality control\" for the 25,600 Rotary clubs of the world. They are responsible for maintaining high performance within the clubs of their district. The district governor, who must make an official visit to each club in his district, is never regarded as an \"inspector general.\" Rather, he visits as a helpful and friendly adviser to the club officers, as a useful counselor to further the Object of Rotary among the clubs of his district, and as a catalyst to help strengthen the programs of Rotary. The district governor is a very experienced Rotarian who generously devotes a year of their life to the volunteer task of leadership. The governor has a wealth of knowledge about current Rotary pro- grams, purposes, policies and goals. He or she is a person of recognized high standing in his profession, community and Rotary club. They must supervise the organization of new clubs and strengthen existing ones. They perform a host of specific duties to assure that the quality of Rotary does not falter in his district. They are responsible to promote and implement all programs and activities of the Rotary International president and the R.I. Board of Directors. The governor plans and directs a district conference and other special events. Each district governor performs a very important role in the worldwide operations of Rotary. The district governor is truly a prime example of Service Above Self performing a labor of love.\n \n \nTHE DISTRICT ASSEMBLY\nIn view of the annual turnover of Rotary leadership each year, special effort is required to provide the 25,600 club leaders with appropriate instruction for the tasks they will assume. The annual district assembly is the major leadership-training event in each of the 500 Rotary districts of the world. The district assembly offers motivation, inspiration, Rotary information and new ideas for club officers, directors and key committee chairmen of each club. Some of the most experienced district leaders conduct informative discussions on all phases of Rotary administration and service projects. The assembly gives all participants valuable new ideas to make their club more effective and interesting. Usually eight to ten delegates from each club are invited to attend the training session. Another important feature of a district assembly is a review by the incoming district governor of the program theme and emphasis of the new R.l. president for the coming year. District goals and objects are also described and plans are developed for their implementation. The success of each Rotary club is frequently determined by the club's full representation and participation in the annual district assembly.\n \nTHE DISTRICT CONFERENCE\n \nMost Rotarians have never attended a Rotary district conference. They have not experienced one of the most enjoyable and rewarding privileges of Rotary membership. A district conference is for all club members and their spouses, not just for club officers and committee members. The purpose of a District Conference is for fellowship, good fun, inspirational speakers and discussion of matters which make one's Rotary membership more meaningful. Every person who attends a district conference finds that being a Rotarian becomes even more rewarding because of the new experiences, insights and acquaintances developed at the Conference. Those who attend a Conference enjoy going back, year after year. Every one of Rotary's 500 districts has a conference annually. These meetings are considered so important that the Rotary International president selects a knowledgeable Rotarian as his personal representative to attend and address each conference. The program always includes several outstanding entertainment features, interesting discussions and inspirational programs. One of the unexpected benefits of attending a district conference is the opportunity to become better acquainted with members of one's own club in an informal setting. Lasting friendships grow from the fellowship hours at the district conference.\n \nYOUTH EXCHANGE\n \nRotary Youth Exchange is one of Rotary's most popular programs to promote international understanding and develop lifelong friendships. It began in 1927 with the Rotary Club of Nice, France. In 1939 an extensive Youth Exchange was created between California and Latin America. Since then the program has expanded around the world. In recent years more than 7,000 young people have participated annually in Rotary-sponsored exchange programs. The values of Youth Exchange are experienced not only by the high school-age students involved but also by the host families, sponsoring clubs, receiving high schools and the entire community. Youth Exchange participants usually provide their fellow students in their host schools with excellent opportunities to learn about customs, languages, traditions and family life in another country Youth Exchange offers young people interesting opportunities and rich experiences to see another part of the world. Students usually spend a full academic year aboard, although some clubs and districts sponsor short-term exchanges of several weeks or months. Approximately 36 percent of Rotary Youth Exchange students are hosted or sent by the clubs in the United States and Canada. European countries account for about 40 percent, and 12 percent come from Australia and New Zealand. Asian clubs sponsor 5 percent, and 7 percent come from Latin American countries. Over 70 percent of all Rotary districts participate in Youth Exchange activities. Youth Exchange is a highly recommended program for all Rotary clubs as a practical activity for the enhancement of international understanding and goodwill.\n \nNO PERSONAL PRIVILEGES\n \nFrequently friends ask whether Rotarians receive special business benefits from their Rotary membership. Should Rotarians expect a special discount or some preferential service just because they are dealing with a fellow Rotarian? The answer is clearly \"no.\" The Rotary Manual of Procedure expressly states the Rotary position on this matter. The policy, originally approved by the R.I. Board of Directors in 1933, is that in business and professional relations \"a Rotarian should not expect, and far less should he ask for, more consideration or advantages from a fellow Rotarian than the latter would give to any other business or professional associate with whom he has business relations. \" Over 50 years ago the concept was expressed that \"true friends demand nothing of one another, and any abuse of the confidence of friendship for profit is foreign to the spirit of Rotary.\" On the other hand, if new or increased business comes as the natural result of friendship created in Rotary, it is the same normal development which takes place outside of Rotary as well as inside, so it is not an infringement on the ethics of Rotary membership. It is important to remember that the primary purpose of Rotary membership is to provide each member with a unique opportunity to serve others, and membership is not intended as a means for personal profit or special privileges.\n \nEVERY ROTARIAN AN EXAMPLE TO YOUTH\n \nIn much of the official literature of Rotary International relating to service to young people, a special slogan will be found--\"Every Rotarian an Example to Youth.\" These words were adopted in 1949 by the Rotary International Board of Directors as an expression of commitment to children and youth in each community in which Rotary clubs exist. Serving young people has long been an important part of the Rotary program. Youth service projects take many forms around the world. Rotarians sponsor Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops, athletic teams, handicapped children's centers, school safety patrols, summer camps, recreation areas, safe driving clinics, county fairs, child care centers and children's hospitals. Many clubs provide vocational counseling, establish youth employment programs and promote use of the 4-Way Test. Increasingly, drug and alcohol abuse prevention projects are being supported by Rotarians. In every instance, Rotarians have an opportunity to be role models for the young men and women of their community. One learns to serve by observing others. As our youth grow to become adult leaders, it is hoped each will achieve that same desire and spirit to serve future generations of children and youth. The slogan accepted over 40 years ago is just as vital today. It is a very thoughtful challenge--\"Every Rotarian an Example to Youth.\"\n \nWORLD COMMUNITY SERVICE\n \nWorld Community Service is the Rotary program by which a club or district in one country provides humanitarian assistance to a club in another country. Typically the aid goes to a developing community where the Rotary project will help raise the standard of living and the quality of life. The ultimate object of World Community Service is to build goodwill and understanding among peoples of the world. One important way to find a club in some other part of the world which needs help on a worthy project is to use the WCS Projects Exchange, a list of dozens of worthy activities in developing areas. The exchange list is maintained in the R.I. Secretariat in Evanston and is readily available upon request. It outlines projects, provides estimated costs and gives names of the appropriate contacts. Clubs, which need assistance, or are seeking another club to help with a humanitarian project, such as building a clinic, school, hospital, community water well, library or other beneficial activity, may register their needs. Clubs seeking a desirable World Community Service project may easily review the list of needs registered in the Projects Exchange. Thus, the exchange provides a practical way to link needs with resources. Every Rotary club is urged to undertake a new World Community Service project each year. The WCS Projects Exchange list is an excellent tool to find a real need, a project description and cooperating club in a developing area. The job then is to \"go to work\" to complete the project, and at the same time build bridges of friendship and world understanding.\n \nWOMEN'S GROUPS ASSOCIATED WITH ROTARY CLUBS\n \nSome very significant programs of Rotary service are not conducted by Rotarians. This is true because of the many projects sponsored by organizations of Rotarians' wives and other women relatives associated with Rotary clubs around the world. Women's groups--often called Women of Rotary, Rotary Ann Clubs, Las Damas de Rotary, Rotary Wives or, the more formalized organization, The Inner Wheel--annually conduct hundreds of notable projects of humanitarian service in their communities. The women's groups establish schools, baby clinics, food and clothing distribution centers, hospital facilities, orphanages, homes for the elderly and other service activities, and they frequently provide volunteer service on a day-to-day basis to operate child- care centers for working mothers and provide necessary resources for Youth Exchange students. Usually the women's groups complement and supplement the programs of service performed by the local Rotary clubs. Many of the women's groups actively conduct international service projects as well as local projects. The R.I. Board of Directors in 1984 recognized the excellent service and fellowship of the clubs and organization of women relatives of Rotarians and encouraged all Rotary clubs to sponsor such informal organizations.\n \nFUNCTIONAL LITERACY PROGRAM\n \nIt has been estimated than a billion people--one-fourth of the world's population--are unable to read. Illiteracy of adults and children is a global concern in both highly industrialized nations and in developing countries. The number of adult illiterates in the world is increasing by 25 million each year! In the United States, one quarter of the entire population is considered functionally illiterate. The tragedy of illiteracy is that those who cannot read lose personal independence and become victims of unscrupulous manipulation, poverty and the loss of human feelings which give meaning to life. Illiteracy is demeaning. It is a major obstacle for economic, political, social and personal development. Illiteracy is a barrier to international understanding, cooperation and peace in the world. Literacy education was considered a program priority by Rotary's original Health, Hunger and Humanity Committee in 1978. An early 3-H grant led to the preparation of an excellent source book on the issues of literacy in the world. The Rotary-sponsored publication, The Right to Read, was edited by Rotarian Eve Malmquist, a past district governor from Linkoping, Sweden, and a recognized authority on reading and educational research. The book was the forerunner of a major Rotary program emphasis on literacy promotion. In 1985 the R.I. Planning and Research Committee proposed, and the R.I. board approved, that the Rotary clubs of the world conduct a ten-year emphasis on literacy education. Many Rotary clubs are thoughtfully surveying the needs of their community for literacy training. Some clubs provide basic books for teaching reading. Others establish and support reading and language clinics, provide volunteer tutorial assistance and purchase reading materials. Rotarians can play a vitally important part in their community and in developing countries by promoting projects to open opportunities, which come from the ability to read.\n \nCONCERN FOR THE AGING\n \nOne current area of special emphasis for Rotary clubs focuses on providing \"new opportunities for the aging.\" In 1990, the R.I. Board of Directors urged Rotarians to identify new projects serving the elderly that emphasize intergenerational activities and the integration of seniors into society and the workplace. The following year, the board called for an approach that stressed service \"with\" the elderly as well as \"for\" them. With the substantial upswing in the worldwide population of older persons, their needs for special attention have greatly multiplied. As citizens grow older, it becomes increasingly important for them to retain their personal independence and to remain in control of their own lives to the extent this is possible. Many Rotary clubs are seeking ways to serve the older persons of their community who face problems of deteriorating health, loneliness, poor nutrition, transportation difficulties, inability to do customary chores, loss of family associations, reduced recreational opportunities, inadequate housing and limited information about available social agencies for emergency assistance. Some clubs have initiated a valuable community service to assist older persons in retirement planning and adjustment by organizing and sharing the wealth of information available within the club's membership. Other clubs have developed foster grandparent programs and other intergenerational activities that allow seniors to use their experience and knowledge to help young people. Rotarians often can provide services, which seniors can no longer do for themselves. The greatest need of aging individuals is frequently a mere expression of real caring and concern by thoughtful friends. All Rotarians should seriously consider how they and their clubs may actively participate in programs for the aging. It is one area of community service in which there is a growing possibility that each of us may some day be on the receiving end.\n \nINTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS\n \nEach May or June, Rotary International holds a worldwide convention \"to stimulate, inspire and inform all Rotarians at an international level.\" The convention, which may not be held in the same country for more than two consecutive years, is the annual meeting to conduct the business of the association. The planning process usually begins about four or five years in advance. Future R.I. conventions are scheduled for Melbourne, Australia in 1993, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1994, Nice, France, in 1995, and Calgary, Canada, in 1996. The R.I. Board determines a general location and invites cities to make proposals. The conventions are truly international events which 15,000 to 20,000 Rotarians and guests attend. All members should plan to participate in a Rotary International convention to discover the real internationality of Rotary. It is an experience you'll never forget.\n \nREGIONAL CONFERENCES\n \nFrom time to time Rotarians may read the promotional literature announcing a regional conference to be held some place in the world. Such a conference is quite similar to the annual Rotary International convention, but generally smaller in attendance and serving Rotarians and guests in a region, which is at a considerable distance from the site of the international convention. The purpose of a regional conference is to develop and promote acquaintance, friendship and understanding among the attendees, as well as to provide a forum to discuss and exchange ideas about Rotary and international affairs related to the geographic areas involved. Regional conferences usually attract two or three thousand individuals and because they are considered special events in the Rotary calendar, are not held on any regular schedule. The conferences are arranged periodically, according to the interest of the Rotary leaders in specific regions. Many of the operational tasks of the conferences are handled by the R.I. secretariat. Although there is no special effort to promote attendance by Rotarians outside of the region involved, members from all parts of the world are always welcome to attend. Attending a conference in another region is an enjoyable, rewarding and fascinating experience. They provide another facet to the international fellowship of Rotary.\n \nINTERCOUNTRY COMMITTEES\n \nIn 1931 Rotarians in France and Germany organized the \"petit comite,\" a small group with the goal of fostering better relations between the people of these two neighboring nations. Since that time, Rotarians through- out Europe have led the way in creating Intercountry Committees to encourage contacts between Rotarians and Rotary clubs across national boundaries. Intercountry Committees have now been established in many parts of the world to promote friendship as well as to cooperate in sponsoring World Community Service projects, student exchanges and other activities to im-prove understanding among nations. Frequently, the Intercountry Commit-tees sponsor visits of Rotarians and their families across national borders and arrange intercity meetings and conferences. In some instances, Intercountry Committees are created between countries separated by great distances in an effort to encourage goodwill and friendship with matched or partner areas of the world. The Intercountry Committees coordinate their efforts with the district governors of their countries and always serve in an advisory capacity to districts and clubs. Intercountry Committees provide an additional means for Rotary clubs and Rotarians to fulfill the responsibilities of the Fourth Avenue of Service--international understanding, goodwill and peace in the world.\n \nR.I.B.I.\n \nThe structure of Rotary International in Great Britain and Ireland (R.I.B.I.) forms an interesting chapter in our history. In 1914, after Rotary expanded across the Atlantic to Great Britain and Ireland, a British Association of Rotary Clubs was established as part of the International Association of Rotary Clubs. During World War I there was little contact between the international clubs, and the British association held the small number of Rotary clubs together in Great Britain, Ireland and a few other European communities. Following the war, a new Rotary International Constitution was adopted in 1922 which established the principle that whenever a country had 25 Rotary clubs it could become a \"territorial unit\" and thus have a representative on the R.l. board and receive other specific powers. The clubs in Great Britain and Ireland immediately petitioned for and received the status of a \"territorial unit. \" No other group in the world made such a request or received that status. In 1927 Rotary International terminated the territorial unit concept and organized Rotary clubs by \"areas\" of the world. However, all of \"the rights, privileges and powers of existing territorial units\" were forever protected and perpetuated. Thus, since R.I.B.I. was the only territorial unit, it has continued to function as an independent unit of Rotary International, subject to certain approvals by the R.I. Constitution. The R.I.B.I. form of administration is uniquely appropriate to Great Britain and Ireland because of geography, language, tradition and custom. Because of this historic relationship, R.I.B.I. maintains a slightly different administrative structure from all the other Rotary clubs and districts in the world, even though it is a full member of Rotary International.\n \nCOUNCIL ON LEGISLATION\n \nIn the early days of Rotary, any change in the R.I. Bylaws or Constitution was proposed and voted upon at the annual convention. As attendance at conventions increased and open discussion became more difficult, a Council on Legislation was created in 1934 as an advisory group to debate and analyze proposals before they were voted upon by the convention. Finally at the 1970 Atlanta Convention, it was decided that the Council on Legislation would actually become the legislative or parliamentary body of Rotary. The council is composed of one delegate from each Rotary district and well as several ex-officio members. It was agreed that the council would meet every three years at a time other than at the Rotary convention. The council, which next meets in 1995, has the responsibility of considering and acting upon all \"enactments,\" which are proposed changes in the Bylaws and Constitution, and \"resolutions,\" which are recommended changes in Rotary policies and procedures. Proposals may be submitted by any Rotary club, district or the R.I. board. The council's actions are subject to review by all the Rotary clubs of the world before they become final. If 10 percent of the voting strength of the clubs oppose a council action, such legislation is nullified and it is submitted for final consideration to the next convention. The Council on Legislation provides the membership of Rotary a democratic process for legislative change in the operations of Rotary International.\n \nWORLD FELLOWSHIP ACTIVITIES\n \nThroughout the wide world of Rotary, many members share similar hobbies, recreational activities and avocations. Rotarians with common interests are encouraged to establish groups, called World Fellowship Activities, or Inter- national Fellowships, to promote friendship and share their special leisure-time experiences. One of the pioneer fellowship groups, the International Golfing Fellow- ship, has held an annual gathering and golf tournament for the past 26 years in various cities of the world. Many of the fellowships promote their activity at colorful booths set up at Rotary's annual international convention. Some popular World Fellowship Activities are flying, amateur radio, stamp collecting, music, yachting, caravanning, skiing, tennis and travel. More unusual \"fellowships\" involve Rotarians interested in genealogy, recreational vehicles, curling, tree planting, home exchange, railroading, tape recording and roaming. The World Fellowship of Esperanto brings together friends interested in a common world language. Groups have also been organized for hunting and fishing, chess, running and fitness and numismatics. Most of the groups publish regular newsletters and bulletins for their members. All Rotarians are welcome to join any of the World Fellowship Activities. Membership offers a new dimension of friendship and enjoyable activity with Rotarians around the world.\n \nROTARY FRIENDSHIP EXCHANGE\n \nAn interesting Rotary program of fellowship is the Rotary Friend- ship Exchange. This activity, originally recommended by the New Horizons Committee in 1981, is intended to encourage Rotarians and spouses to visit with Rotarian families in other parts of the world. It may be conducted on a club-to-club or district-to-district basis. The idea is for several Rotarian couples to travel to another country on the Rotary Friendship Exchange. Later the hospitality is reversed when the visit is exchanged. After a successful pilot experiment, the Rotary Friendship Exchange has become a permanent program of Rotary. The Rotary Friendship Exchange is frequently compared to the Group Study Exchange program of The Rotary Foundation, except that it involves Rotarian couples who personally pay for all expenses of their intercountry experience. Doors of friendship are opened in a way, which could not be duplicated except in Rotary. Rotarians seeking an unusual vacation and fellowship experience should learn more about the Rotary Fellowship Exchange. Some unusual Rotary adventures are awaiting you!\n \nROTARY YOUTH LEADERSHIP AWARDS (RYLA)\n \nEach summer thousands of young people are selected to attend Rotary-sponsored leadership camps or seminars in the United States, Australia, Canada, India, France, Argentina, Korea and numerous other countries. In an informal out-of-doors atmosphere, 50 to 75 outstanding young men and/or women spend a week in a challenging program of discussions, inspirational addresses, leadership training and social activities designed to enhance personal development, leadership skills and good citizenship. The official name of this activity is the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards program (RYLA), although the event is occasionally referred to as Camp Royal, Camp Enterprise, Youth Leaders Seminars, Youth Conferences or other terms. The RYLA program began in Australia in 1959, when young people throughout the state of Queensland were selected to meet with Princess Alexandra, the young cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. The Rotarians of Brisbane, who hosted the participants, were impressed with the quality of the young leaders. It was decided to bring youth leaders together each year for a week of social, cultural and educational activities. The RYLA program gradually grew throughout all the Rotary districts of Australia and New Zealand. In 1971, the R.I. Board of Directors adopted RYLA as an official program of Rotary International.\n \nROTARY VILLAGE CORPS\n \nOne of the newer programs in Rotary's panoply of worldwide service activities and projects is the Rotary Village Corps. This new form of grassroots self-help service was initiated by R.I. President M.A.T. Caparas in 1986 as a means of improving the quality of life in villages, neighborhoods and communities. Frequently there is an abundance of available labor, but no process to mobilize men and women to conduct useful projects of community improvement. The Rotary Village Corps--or Rotary Community Corps as they are called in industrialized countries--is a Rotary club-sponsored group of non- Rotarians who desire to help their own community by conducting a specific improvement project. The Rotary members provide the guidance, encouragement, organizational structure and some of the material assistance for the Rotary Village Corps, which in turn contributes the manpower to help their own community. Thus, the Rotary Village Corps provides a totally new process for Rotarians to serve in communities of great need. Rotary Community Corps have been organized mainly in depressed ghetto areas of major cities where groups of individuals need the organizational and managerial skills of Rotarians to undertake valuable self-help community projects. The Rotary Village Corps program offers a totally new dimension to the concept of service to improve the quality of life.\n \nINTERACT\n \nInteract, the Rotary youth program, was launched by the R.I. Board of Directors in 1962. The first Interact club was established by the Rotary Club of Melbourne, Florida. Interact clubs provide opportunities for boys and girls of secondary school age to work together in a world fellowship of service and international understanding. The term, Interact, is derived from \"inter\" for international, and \"act\" for action. Every Interact club must be sponsored and supervised by a Rotary club and must plan annual projects of service to its school, community and in the world. Today there are over 7,000 Interact clubs with more than 154,000 members in 93 countries. \"Interactors\" develop skills in leadership and attain practical experience in conducting service projects, thereby learning the satisfaction that comes from serving others. A major goal of Interact is to provide opportunities for young people to create greater understanding and goodwill with youth throughout the world.\n \nROTARACT\n \nAfter the success of Interact clubs for high school-age youth in the early 1960s, the R.I. Board created Rotaract in 1968. The new organization was designed to promote responsible citizenship and leadership potential in clubs of young men and women, aged 18 to 30. The first Rotaract club was chartered by the Charlotte North Rotary Club in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1991 there were nearly 122,000 members in more than 5,200 Rotaract clubs in 104 countries. Rotaract clubs emphasize the importance of individual responsibility as the basis of personal success and community involvement. Each club sponsors an annual project to promote high ethical standards in one's business and professional life. Rotaract also provides opportunities leading to greater international understanding and goodwill. Rotaractors enjoy many social activities as well as programs to improve their community. A Rotaract club can exist only when continuously sponsored, guided and counseled by a Rotary club. The programs of Rotaract are built around the motto \"Fellowship Through Service.\"\n \nROTARY FLOAT IN ROSE PARADE\n \nThe Rotary International float in the annual Tournament of Roses Parade is undoubtedly the largest public relations project of the Rotary clubs of the United States and Canada. Since 1924 a Rotary float has been entered 18 times including every year since 1981. The famous Pasadena, California, parade is seen by an estimated 125 million people via worldwide television. Funds for the construction of the Rotary parade entry are voluntarily given by Rotarians and clubs in the U.S. and Canada. The cost of designing, constructing and flower covering a Rose Parade float begins at about $120,000. A multi-district Rotary committee in Southern California coordinates planning of the Rotary float and provides hundreds of volunteer hours of service. The Rotary float must portray the annual parade theme, usually depicting one of the worldwide service programs of Rotary International. Each New Year's Day, Rotarians take pride in seeing their attractive float and realize they have shared in its construction by contributing a dollar or two to this beautiful public relations project.\n \nSTILL MORE ROTARY FIRSTS\n \nRotary      first presented \"Significant Achievement Awards\" in 1969 to clubs      with outstanding international or community services projects.\nRotary's      first Interact club was organized in Melbourne, Florida, in 1962 to become      the pioneer for about 7,000 Interact clubs in more than 90 countries.\nRotary's      first convention held in the Southern Hemisphere was in Rio de Janeiro,      Brazil, in 1948.\nRotary      was assigned the copyright on the \"4-Way Test\" in 1954 when its      author, Herbert Taylor, became president of Rotary International.\nRotary's      first Community Service project took place in 1907 when Chicago Rotarians      led a campaign to install a public \"comfort station\" in the city      hall.\n1964-65      was the first year when The Rotary Foundation received total contributions      of a million dollars in a singleï¿½ year. Today more than $40 million is given annually. Contributions      since 1917 total nearly $650 million.\nRotary's      first appeal for aid to disaster victims was in 1913 when $25,000 was      given for flood relief in Ohio and Indiana.\nRotary's      motto, \"He Profits Most Who Serves Best,\" was first expressed at      Rotary's very first Convention in Chicago in 1910.\n \nR.I.'s GENERAL SECRETARY\n \nThe day-to-day operations of Rotary International's secretariat are under the supervision of the general secretary, the top professional officer of Rotary. Although the general secretary is responsible to the R.I. Board of Directors and president, he provides the ongoing management for nearly 500 staff members who compose the secretariat of Rotary International. The general secretary serves as secretary to the R.I. board, and is also the chief executive and financial officer of The Rotary Foundation, under the supervision of the trustees of the Foundation. He is the secretary of all Rotary committees as well as the Council on Legislation, regional conferences and the annual Rotary convention. The General Secretary's Letter is a newsletter that provides up-to-date information to Rotary officers throughout the world. The general secretary is appointed by the R.I. board for a term of not more than five years and is usually reelected. Since 1910, seven men\nï¿½Lovejoy (1942-52), George Means (1953-72), Harry Stewart (1972-78), Herb Pigman (1979-86) and Philip Lindsey (1986-90). The present general secretary, Spencer Robinson, Jr., came to the position in 1990. Throughout the history of Rotary, the personal influence and administrative skills of our general secretaries have significantly shaped the course of Rotary programs and activities.\n \nSELECTING THE PRESIDENT\n \nEach year a distinguished Rotarian is selected as the worldwide president of Rotary International. The process begins two years in advance when a 15-man nominating committee is elected from separate regions of the world. To qualify for the nominating committee, a Rotarian must have served on the R.I. Board of Directors and have extensive Rotary experience and substantial acquaintanceship with the world leaders of Rotary. The nominating committee may consider all former R.I. directors for the presidential candidate. Members of the nominating committee and cur-rent directors are not eligible. Any Rotary club may suggest the name of a former R.I. director to the committee for consideration. The committee convenes in September to select the Rotarian to be the presidential nominee. His name is announced to all clubs. Any Rotary club may make an additional nomination before December 1, which must then be endorsed by one percent of all the Rotary clubs of the world (about 250). If such an event occurs, an election is held by mail ballot. If no additional nomination is presented by the clubs, the man selected by the nominating committee is declared to be the president-nominee. From that point on, that special Rotarian and his wife will spend more than a year in preparation and then a year serving the Rotarians of the world as the international president.\n \nANNUAL ROTARY THEMES\n \nIn 1955, R.I. President A.Z. Baker announced a theme, \"Develop Our Resources,\" to serve as Rotary's program of emphasis. Since that time, each president has issued a theme for his Rotary year. The shortest theme was in 1961-62 when Joseph Abey selected \"Act.\" Other one-word themes were chosen in 1958-59 by Charles Tennent (\"Serve\") and 1968-69 by Kiyoshi Togasaki (\"Participate\"). Carl Miller, in 1963-64, had a theme for the times when he proposed \"Guidelines for Rotary in the Space Age.\" Other \"timely\" themes were in 1980- 81 when Rolf Klarich created \"Take Time to Serve\" and William Carter in 1973-74 used \"Time for Action.\" Two themes have a similarity to commercial advertising: \"A Better World Through Rotary\" (Richard Evans, 1966-67) and \"Reach Out\" (Clem Renouf, 1978-79). Bridges have been a striking metaphor. Harold Thomas, 1959-60, urged Rotarians to \"Build Bridges of Friendship\"; William Walk, 1970-71, created \"Bridge the Gap\"; and Hiroji Mukasa, 1982-83, declared \"Mankind is One--Build Bridges of Friendship Throughout the World.\" A worldwide focus was given by Stan McCaffrey in 1981-82 with the message, \"World Understanding and Peace Through Rotary,\" and again in 1984- 85 by Carlos Canseco who urged Rotarians to \"Discover a New World of Service.\" In other years, the individual was emphasized, as \"You Are Rotary\" (Edd McLaughlin, 1960-61), \"Goodwill Begins With You\" (Ernst Breitholtz, 1971-72) and \"You Are the Key\" (Ed Cadman, 1985-86). Frequently the theme urges Rotarians to become more involved in their club, such as \"Share Rotaryï¿½Serve People\" (Bill Skelton, 1983-84) or \"Make Your Rotary Membership Effective\" (Luther Hodges, 1967-68). But whether you \"Review and Renew,\" \"Take a New Look,\" \"Let Service Light the Way\" or \"Dignify the Human Being,\" it is clear that the R.I. president provides Rotarians with an important annual program of emphasis. In 1986-87, President M.A.T. Caparas selected the inspiring message that \"Rotary Brings Hope.\" Charles Keller in 1987- 88 saw \" Rotarians--United in Service, Dedicated to Peace,\" while Royce Abbey asked his fellow members in 1988-89 to \"Put Life into Rotaryï¿½Your Life.\" Hugh Archer (1989 -90) urged us to \"Enjoy Rotary! \" and Paulo Costa (1990-91 ) asked that we \"Honor Rotary with Faith and Enthusiasm. \" My predecessor Raja Saboo (1991-92) exhorted every Rotarian to \"Look Beyond Yourself.\" For 1992-93 I am reminding Rotarians, \"Real Happiness Is Helping Others.\"\n \nCAMPAIGNING PROHIBITED\n \nOne of the interesting bylaws of Rotary International provides that \"no Rotarian shall campaign, canvass or electioneer for elective position in Rotary International.\" This provision includes the office of district governor, Rotary International director, R.I. president and various elected committees. The Rotary policy prohibits the circulation of brochures, literature or letters by a candidate or by anyone on behalf of such a candidate. After a Rotarian has indicated his intention to be a candidate for one of the elective Rotary offices, he must refrain from speaking engagements, appearances or publicity which could reasonably be construed as furthering his candidacy. The only information, which may be sent to clubs relating to candidates for an elective position is that officially distributed by the general secretary of R.I. A Rotarian who becomes a candidate for an elective position, such as district governor or R.l. director, must avoid any action which would be interpreted as giving him an unfair advantage over other candidates. Failure to comply with these provisions prohibiting campaigning could result in the disqualification of the candidate. In Rotary it is believed that a Rotarian's record of service and qualifications for office stand on their own and do not require publicity or special promotion.\n \nTHE ROTARY FOUNDATION'S BEGINNING\n \nSome magnificent projects grow from very small seeds. The Rotary Foundation had that sort of modest beginning. In 1917 R.I. President Arch Klumph told the delegates to the Atlanta Convention that \"it seems eminently proper that we should accept endowments for the purpose of doing good in the world.\" The response was polite and favorable, but the fund was slow to materialize. A year later the \"Rotary Endowment Fund,\" as it was first labeled, received its first contribution of $26.50 from the Rotary Club of Kansas City, which was the balance of the Kansas City Convention account following the 1918 annual meeting. Additional small amounts were annually contributed, but after six years it is reported that the endowment fund had only reached $700. A decade later, The Rotary Foundation was formally established at the 1928 Minneapolis Convention. In the next four years the Foundation fund grew to $50,000. In 1937 a $2 million goal was announced for The Rotary Foundation, but these plans were cut short and abandoned with the outbreak of World War II. In 1947, upon the death of Paul Harris, a new era opened for The Rotary Foundation as memorial gifts poured in to honor the founder of Rotary. From that time, The Rotary Foundation has been achieving its noble objective of furthering \"understanding and friendly relations between peoples of different nations.\" By 1954 the Foundation received for the first time a half million dollars in contributions in a single year, and in 1965 a million dollars was received. It is staggering to imagine that from those humble beginnings, The Rotary Foundation is now receiving more than $40 million each year for educational and humanitarian work around the world.\n \nAMBASSADORIAL SCHOLARSHIPS\n \nIn 1947, the first Rotary Foundation graduate fellowships for a year 's study in another nation were awarded to 18 young men from 11 countries. These initial grants set the pattern for the most extensive international educational scholarship program in the world. From the beginning, the unique feature of Rotary Foundation educational awards was for the scholars to contribute to international understanding and goodwill and not necessarily to earn academic degrees, diplomas or certificates. The intent has been for Rotary scholars to promote friendly relations among people in different countries. Scholarship recipients, now both men and women, are expected to serve as \"ambassadors of goodwill\" in their host country and educational institution. Since the original 18 awards were made in 1947, The Rotary Foundation has granted scholarships to more than 21,000 young scholars from 127 countries. The recipients have been hosted by Rotarians in 105 different countries. There are now about 1,000 scholarships awarded each year which cover travel, living and educational expenses up to $18,000. As of June 1991 The Rotary Foundation had provided over $198 million for educational awards. Rotarians know that Rotary Foundation scholarships are very worth- while investments in the future and one important step in seeking greater understanding and goodwill in the world.\n \nGROUP STUDY EXCHANGE\n \nOne of the most popular and rewarding programs of The Rotary Foundation is the Group Study Exchange. Since the first exchange between districts in California and Japan in 1965, the program has provided educational experiences for more than 20,000 young business and professional men and women who have served on about 4,600 teams. The GSE program pairs Rotary districts to send and receive study teams. In the past 25 years, over $40 million has been allocated by The Rotary Foundation for Group Study Exchange grants. One of the attractive features of GSE is the opportunity for the six visiting team members to meet, talk and live with Rotarians and their families in a warm spirit of friendship and hospitality. Although the original Group Study Exchanges were male only, in recent years teams include both men and women. In addition to learning about another country as the team visits farms, schools, industrial plants, professional offices and governmental establishments, the GSE teams serve as ambassadors of goodwill. They interpret their home nation to host Rotarians and others in the communities in which they visit. Many of the personal contacts blossom into lasting friendships. Truly, the Group Study Exchange program has provided Rotarians with one of its most enjoyable, practical and meaningful ways to promote world understanding.\n \nWORLD-COMPETITIVE SCHOLARSHIPS\n \nThe Rotary Foundation Ambassadorial Scholarship Program is the largest privately funded such program in the world. Only the Fulbright Program, funded by the United States government, is larger in terms of participation and expenditures. While most Rotarians are generally aware of the program, many are not familiar with the world-competitive scholarships awarded to special groups. Twenty-five two-year Freedom from Hunger scholarships are awarded annually to scholars from low-income countries to earn master's degrees in agriculture or food production in another country. These scholars are committed to return to their home countries to develop agriculture -related programs to enhance national food supplies. Fifteen Japan Program scholarships are awarded annually for scholars to study in Japan for 21 months. Twelve months are spent doing intensive Japanese language studies at International Christian University in Tokyo; then an additional academic year is spent doing regular studies at another Japanese university. These awards were created to increase scholar assignments to Japan (where initial language ability is often a problem) and to address the growing demand for instruction in the Japanese language.\n \nHEALTH, HUNGER AND HUMANITY GRANTS\n \nIn the spring of 1979, Rotary launched its most comprehensive humanitarian service activity with the Health, Hunger and Humanity Pro-gram. The 3-H Program is designed to undertake large-scale service projects beyond the capacity of individual Rotary clubs or groups of clubs. By 1991, more than 60 different 3-H projects had been approved and undertaken in over 40 different countries, at a monetary value of over $13 million. The objective of these projects is to improve health, alleviate hunger and enhance human, cultural and social development among peoples of the world. The ultimate goal is to advance international understanding, goodwill and peace. The first 3-H project was the immunization of 6 million children in the Philippines against polio. As 3-H progressed, new programs were added to help people in developing areas o the world. Now, in addition to the mass polio immunization of over 100 million children in various countries, 3-H has promoted nutrition programs, vocational education, improved irrigation to increase food production, polio victim rehabilitation and other activities which benefit large numbers of people in developing countries. All 3-H projects are supported by the voluntary contributions of Rotarians through The Rotary Foundation. In years to come the3-H Program may well be considered Rotary's finest service activity, showing how Rotarians care and are concerned about people in need, wherever they may be.\n \nMATCHING GRANTS\n \nAmong the programs of The Rotary Foundation are the Matching Grants that assist Rotary clubs and districts in conducting international service projects. Since 1965, more than 1,900 grants have been awarded for projects in about 135 countries with expenditures of more than $16.4 million. A club or district must contribute an amount at least as large as that requested from The Rotary Foundation. Grants have been made to improve hospitals, develop school programs, drill water wells, assist the handicapped or persons requiring special medical attention, provide resources for orphan- ages, create sanitation facilities, distribute food and medical supplies and many other forms of international community service in needy areas of the world. Some grants are for projects in the magnitude of from $20,000 to $50,00(), but most are in the range of $5,000 to $10,000. Matching Grants are not approved to purchase land or build buildings, and they may not be used for programs already underway or completed. Personal participation by the Rotarians of the sponsoring club is required and the benefits should extend beyond the recipients. The Matching Grants program is a very significant part of The Rotary Foundation and provides an important incentive for clubs to undertake worthwhile international service projects in another part of the world. They certainly foster goodwill and understanding, which is in keeping with the objectives of The Rotary Foundation.\n \nPOLIOPLUS\n \nPolioPlus is Rotary's massive effort to immunize the children of the world against poliomyelitis. It is part of a global effort to protect the children from five other deadly diseases as well--the \"plus\" in PolioPlus. The program was launched in 1985 with fund raising as a primary focus. The original goal was to raise $120 million. By 1988, Rotarians of the world had raised more than $219 million in cash and pledges. By l992, the cash total exceeded $240 million! These gifts have enabled The Rotary Foundation to make grants to provide a five-year supply of vaccine for any developing country requesting it to protect its children. Grants have been made to nearly 100 countries--a commitment, thus far, of $177 million to buy vaccine and to improve vaccine quality. In 1988, the World Health Organization adopted a goal of eradicating polio throughout the world by the year 2000, and Rotary has endorsed that goal, hoping to celebrate a polio-free world in its own 100th anniversary year, 2005. Achieving eradication will be difficult (only one other disease, small pox, has ever been eradicated) and expensive (estimated cost to the international community is nearly $2 billion). It will require continuing immunization of children worldwide, and it also must include systematic reporting of all suspected cases, community wide vaccination to contain outbreaks of the disease, and establishment of laboratory networks. Rotary will not be alone in all these efforts but in partnership with national governments, the World and Pan American Health Organizations, UNICEF and others. Rotary's \"people power\" gives us a special \"hands on\" role. Rotarians in developing countries have given thousands of hours and countless in-kind gifts to help eradication happen in their countries. No other nongovernmental organization ever has made a commitment of the scale of PolioPlus. Truly it may be considered the greatest humanitarian service the world has ever seen. Every Rotarian can share the pride of that achievement!\n \nROTARY PEACE PROGRAMS\n \nA special program of The Rotary Foundation was originally labeled the \"Rotary Peace Forum.\" The concept of a center or educational program to promote greater understanding and peace in the world was originally dis-cussed in 1982 by the New Horizons Committee and the World Understanding and Peace Committee. In 1984 it was further explored by a New Programs Committee of The Rotary Foundation. The essence of the Rotary Peace Program is to utilize the non- governmental but worldwide resources of Rotary to develop educational programs around the issues that cause conflict among nations in the world as well as those influences and activities which promote peace, development and goodwill. The program includes seminars, publications, conferences and speakers services as a means to initiate a global dialogue to find new approaches to peace and world understanding. Specific Rotary Peace Programs are established annually by the Trustees of The Rotary Foundation. A committee of distinguished Rotary leaders create the programs and provide annual guidelines for responsible new pathways to peace.\n \nPAUL HARRIS FELLOWS\n \nUndoubtedly the most important step to promote voluntary giving to The Rotary Foundation occurred in 1957, when the idea of Paul Harris Fellow recognition was first proposed. Although the concept of making $1,000 gifts to the Foundation was slow in developing, by the early 1970s the program began to gain popularity. The distinctive Paul Harris Fellow medallion, lapel pin and attractive certificate have become highly respected symbols of a substantial financial commitment to The Rotary Foundation by Rotarians and friends around the world. The companion to the Paul Harris Fellow is the Paul Harris Sustaining Member, which is the recognition presented to an individual who has given, or in whose honor a gift is made, a contribution of $100, with the stated intention of making additional contributions until $1,000 is reached. At that time the Paul Harris Sustaining Member becomes a Paul Harris Fellow. By early 1992, more than 350,000 Paul Harris Fellows and 150,000 Sustaining Members have been added to the rolls of The Rotary Foundation. A special recognition pin is given to Paul Harris Fellows who make additional gifts of $1,000 to the Foundation. The distinctive gold pin includes a blue stone to represent each $1,000 contribution up to a total of $5,000 in additional gifts. Paul Harris recognition provides a very important incentive for the continuing support needed to underwrite the many programs of The Rotary Foundation which build goodwill and understanding in the world.\n \nCITATION FOR MERITORIOUS SERVICE and DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARD\n \nTwo very special awards of recognition occasionally are presented by the Trustees of The Rotary Foundation to Rotarians who render unusual service to The Rotary Foundation. The Rotary Foundation Citation for Meritorious Service recognizes significant and dedicated service by a Rotarian to promote the program of The Rotary Foundation and thus advance the Foundation's goal of better understanding and friendly relations among people of the world. The second award, called the Distinguished Service Award, is presented to a Rotarian whose outstanding record of service to The Rotary Foundation is on a much broader basis and spreads beyond the district level and continues over an extended period of time. The Distinguished Service Award acknowledges the sustained efforts of a Rotarian who normally would have already received the Citation of Meritorious Service, for continuing efforts to promote international understanding. Both of these select awards are presented for exemplary personal service and devotion to the Foundation rather than for financial contributions. Usually no more than 25 such awards are granted by the Trustees in any one year. A recipient of the Citation for Meritorious Service would not normally be eligible for nomination for a Distinguished Service Award until two or more years have elapsed. It is a very proud distinction for any Rotarian to be selected for one of these high levels of recognition by The Rotary Foundation Trustees.\n \nPUBLIC RELATIONS OF ROTARY\n \nHistorically Rotarians perpetuated a myth that Rotary should not seek publicity, but rather let our good works speak for themselves. A 1923 policy stating that \"publicity should not be the primary goal of a Rotary club in selecting an activity\" of community service, was frequently interpreted to mean that Rotary clubs should avoid publicity and public relations efforts. Actually, the 1923 statement further observed that \"as a means of extending Rotary's influence, proper publicity should be given to a worthwhile project well carried out.\" A more modern public relations philosophy was adopted in the mid-1970s which affirms that \"good publicity, favorable public relations and a positive image are desirable and essential goals for Rotary\" if it is to foster understanding, appreciation and support for its Object and programs and to broaden Rotary's service to humanity. Active public relations is vital to the success of Rotary. A service project well carried out is considered one of the finest public relations messages of Rotary. It is essential that Rotary clubs make every effort to inform the public about their service projects which have been well performed. As Rotary clubs and districts consider effective public relations, it is important to remember that when Rotarians think of Rotary, we think of our noble goals and motives. But when the world thinks of Rotary, it can only think of our actions and the service we have performed.\n \nUSE OF THE ROTARY EMBLEM\n \nThe Rotary International emblem is officially registered with the U.S. Patent Office as a trademark and \"service mark,\" which prevents it being used in improper ways or by unauthorized individuals. The Rotary emblem should not be altered or modified in any way. Rotarians are encouraged to wear the emblem as a lapel button. It is frequently used on jackets, pens, caps and other personal items manufactured by firms or individuals licensed by the R.I. Board of Directors. Rotary badges, banners, road signs and official Rotary club stationery naturally use the emblem as a mark of identification. The Rotary emblem cannot be used for any commercial purpose. It is not permissible to use it in a political campaign or in connection with any other name or emblem not recognized by Rotary International. Individual Rotarians should not use the Rotary emblem on business cards or stationery or for any other use intended to promote business. Nor is it considered proper for Rotarians to use the emblem on doors or windows of their business premises. It is the responsibility of all Rotarians to wear and use the emblem with pride. The restrictions are provided to assure that the Rotary emblem will not be misused and that it will always bring distinction to the organization.\n \nSPECIAL ROTARY OBSERVANCES\n \nIn the annual Rotary calendar several months are designated to emphasize major programs of Rotary International.\n \nJanuary      is Rotary Awareness Month. This is a time to expand knowledge of Rotary and      its activities among our membership and throughout the community.\nFebruary      is designated as World Understanding Month. This month was chosen because      it includes the birthday of Rotary International, February 23. During the      month, Rotary clubs are urged to present programs, which promote      international understanding and goodwill, as well as launch World      Community Service projects in other parts of the world.\nWorld      Rotaract Week is the week in which March 13 falls. It's a time when Rotary      clubs and districts highlight Rotaract by joining in projects with their      Rotaract clubs.\nApril      is set aside as Rotary's Magazine Month. Throughout the month, clubs      arrange programs and activities, which promote the reading and use of THE      ROTARIAN magazine and the official regional magazines of Rotary.\nAugust      is Membership and Extension Month, a time to focus on Rotary's continuing      need for growth, to seek new members and form new clubs.\nSeptember      is Youth Activities Month. Rotary clubs of the world give special emphasis      to the many Rotary-sponsored programs, which serve children and young      people. During this month many clubs give increased attention to youth      exchange activities.\nOctober      is Vocational Service Month. During this period, clubs highlight the      importance of the business and professional life of each Rotarian. Special      activities promote the vocational avenue of service.\nNovember      is selected to be Rotary Foundation Month.\n \nClubs and districts call attention to the programs of The Rotary Foundation and frequently cultivate additional financial support for the Foundation by promoting contributions for Paul Harris Fellows and Sustaining Members.\n \nEach of these special months serves to elevate the awareness among Rotarians of some of the excellent programs of service, which occur within the world of Rotary.\n \nEXTENDING ROTARY\n \nEvery twelve hours of every day a new Rotary club is chartered in one of the more than 180 countries and geographic regions in which Rotary exists. This steady growth in new clubs is extremely important in extending the worldwide programs and influence of Rotary International. New Rotary clubs may be established anywhere in the world where the fundamental principles of Rotary may be freely observed and wherever it can reasonably be expected that a successful club can be maintained. A club must be organized to serve a specific \"locality,\" or clearly identified territory in which there are enough business or professional persons of good character engaged in proprietary or management positions. A mini-mum of 40 potential classifications is necessary for a proposed new club, and from that list a permanent membership of at least 25 members must be enrolled. Occasionally an existing club will cede a portion of its territory or will share the same territory with a new club. In the process of organizing a new club the first step is to conduct a survey of the locality to determine the potential for new club extension. The district governor's special representative guides the organization of the new club. Among the requirements for a new club is the adoption of the Standard Rotary Club Constitution, a minimum of 25 charter members with clearly established classifications, payment of a charter fee, weekly meetings of the provisional club and the adoption of a club name which will distinctly identify it with its locality. A provisional club becomes a Rotary club when its charter is approved by the board of Rotary International. It is a great opportunity and special duty of all Rotarians to assist and cooperate in organizing new clubs. Knowing that two new Rotary clubs will be chartered someplace in the world today, tomorrow and every day provides a strong endorsement of the vitality and extension of Rotary service throughout the world.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 5:\n\nThe Rotary Club of Newport ... visited 23 local businessmen in a three-week period to set up the requirement of ... (the first Rotary Club, founded in 1905) ... Club History - The Rotary Club of Newport - Balboa Club History - The Rotary Club of Newport - Balboa\nMeeting Makeup Locations\nClub History\nThe Rotary Club of Newport-Balboa (RCNB) was founded in 1939. In those days, there were 200,000 Rotary members worldwide and less than 5,000 clubs in Rotary International. Today there are over 1.2 million members and over 31,000 clubs. Orange County’s polulation in 1939 was only about 150,000. Today we live in a thriving community of over three million.\nIn 1930, the population of Newport Beach, Corona del Mar and Irvine was about 7,000. Costa Mesa was bean fields and Irvine was cow pasture. Balboa Island was 75% vacant lots, Corona del Mar was 80% vacant lots, but the Balboa Peninsula was built up due to the Red Cars coming in with the Los Angeles and Pasadena families to their second (beach) homes. Balboa’s role as the center of Newport Beach life at that time is why our club is called Newport-Balboa, rather than simply Newport Beach.\nIn those days, the Rotary Club of Newport-Balboa territory was basically a resort atmosphere and most of the families who had homes here earned their living elsewhere. In the winter, the streets were put to bed by 9:00 PM, but from Easter vacation to the end of September the area was alive with a population increase of 300%. In our district, our early custom and culture was shaped by individual business ownership and closeness of friendships with one another.\nThis knowledge of the era sets the scene for the beginning of the Newport-Balboa Rotary Club. There was a Lions Club and an Exchange Club in the area. Bob Allen was a city councilman in 1939 and he knew everyone in the area, plus his father was a Rotarian in Pittsburgh, PA and he had visited his father’s Rotary club many times. Bob knew there was an interest in the community for another type of service club. Bob (the first President of RCNB) and Marion Dodd (the first Secretary) visited 23 local businessmen in a three-week period to set up the requirement of charter membership (no one they approached turned them down). All of the original charter members had small businesses, such as shops and stores.\nIn 1939 the Rotary District for this area was number 108, which consisted of four counties: Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and part of San Diego. Earl Stanley, a charter member of the Club and a real estate broker, knew Mac Robbins of the Santa Ana Rotary Club (the first service club in Orange County, chartered in 1920) and Mac knew Karl Glasbreuner (Orange Rotary Club, chartered in 1921), both of whom held the classification of Insurance. Mac Robbins was certainly the right person to know and ask to help form the RCNB; he was a Past President of the Rotary Club of Chicago (the first Rotary Club, founded in 1905) and the first President of the Rotary Club of Santa Ana. The Santa Ana club granted the territory and the Orange club sponsored the Rotary Club of Newport-Balboa.\nThe first meeting was held in May of 1939 at Park Café on Balboa Island on a Tuesday night (it was later changed to Wednesday night). The café was known in those days as the White Café. Meetings were held there from 1939 to 1946. The meetings were held at night because members could not get away from their closely held family stores and shops during the day and the during the heavy summer vacation business cycle.\nIt is understood that the members enjoyed getting to the White Café for the 4:30 to 6:30 “early meeting” at the bar. Art White (charter member) owned the bar and café. It was the only eating place on the Island and the members were able to discuss business and other problems at this early social and fellowship hour. This weekly event also made for a great make-up for other Rotary Clubs.\nIn those early days, nothing was planned for the meetings other than the speaker. The club was known as a “good-time” club (drinks were 35 cents and dinner was $1.50).\nThe Charter Night was held on September 19, 1939 at the Newport Harbor Yacht Club. Over 300 attended the function from all over District 108. The toastmaster was Karl Glasbreuner from the sponsoring club of Orange, and the speaker was Mac Robbins from the Santa Ana club.\nThe Rotary Club of Newport-Balboa has spawned five other Rotary clubs, with three of them still active today: Newport-Irvine (1967), Newport Beach Sunrise (1981) and Costa Mesa (2005).\nUntil 1989 the Constitution and By-laws of Rotary International stated that Rotary club membership was for males only. Women were invited to join Rotary that year. No surprise, there were some members of RCNB who were enthusiastic and others who were not. In any event, the Club elected its first female president, Nan Raney of Balboa Island, less than 10 years later for Rotary year 1997-98.\nMembership hit a high of over 120 in the 1980s time period (before some of the daytime clubs were spun off). Today there are nearly 70 men and women members in the Club, with an average increase lately of about 10 percent per year. The club members gather weekly Wednesday evenings at the Bahia Corinthia Yacht Club in Corona del Mar.\n\n\nDOCUMENT 6:\n\nHow Rotary set its wheel in motion. ... The initial design emerged from the desk of engraver and Rotary Club of ... if that were the case, the club's emblem ... Rotary Wheel - Club Rotario Guatemala Nordeste Rotary Wheel\n  How Rotary set its wheel      in motion\nBy Joseph Derr\nThe emblem ï¿½ known as the      Rotary wheel or gearwheel has been around nearly as long as      Rotary itself, yet it did  most of its evolving during      Rotary's first 15 years.\nThe initial design emerged      from the desk of engraver and Rotary Club of Chicago member      Montague \"Monty\" Bear in 1905, shortly after the formation of      the first Rotary club. Inspired to create an insignia that      symbolized his club, Bear sketched a wagon wheel with 13 spokes,      which was met with approval by Paul P. Harris and the rest of      the founding members.\n \n \n \nBecause wheels rotate, the      wagon wheel insignia seemed a natural choice for a group calling      itself the Rotary Club. And with the automobile still in its      infancy in 1905, the buggy wheel was a sign of the times.\nSoon, fellow club members      began to complain that the design was static and lifeless, so      Bear went to work again. This time, he found inspiration in the      heavens. He added a graphic that appeared to make the wheel ride      on a bed of clouds. But some club members didn't see the      addition in the same way. To them, the clouds looked like dust.      Furthermore, if that were the case, the club's emblem did not      appear to abide by the basic laws of physics: there were dust      clouds on both sides of the wheel. \"Not even Rotary could      raise dust before and aft of a wheel,\" Rotarian \"Long\" Tom      Phillips said of the ill-fated design. \"Which way are we going      anyhow?\"\nSo, Rotary's first graphic      artist went back to his drawing board and inked over the dust      clouds and superimposed a banner ribbon with the words \"Rotary      Club.\" Slightly altered later to clean up dark ink where the      clouds had been, this design, drafted around 1910, would remain      more or less the same for several years, even as automobiles      were gradually replacing wagon buggies on the streets of      Chicago.\n \n \n \nBy 1910, Rotary was no longer      just in Chicago; there were sixteen clubs in the United States      that made up the National Association of Clubs. And with the      charter of each new club came a new design, based loosely on      Bear's wagon wheel motif.\nThe creativity of the first      Rotary clubs yielded great divergence in early emblem designs.      Clubs would often incorporate local history or landmarks into      their emblems. The Rotary Club of Lincoln, Nebraska,      superimposed the wheel over a portrait of Abraham Lincoln in its      emblem, while the Rotary Club of Oakland, California, used an      oak tree for its design.\nBefore long, the Rotary wheel      started to mutate. Several clubs transformed wheels into other      spherical or circular shapes: ship helms, steering wheels,      stars, globes, and other round objects.\nGearing up for a new emblem\n \n \n \nThe soon-to-be International      Association of Clubs realized that it needed a standardized,      official emblem that would be used by all clubs. In 1911, The      National Rotarian magazine's editor and the association's      general secretary, Chesley R. Perry, invited clubs to submit      designs for consideration to the emblem committee at the Duluth,      Minnesota, convention of 1912.\nLooking at early emblems of      two Pennsylvania clubs, it is easy to trace the new Rotary wheel      taking shape. The Rotary Club of Pittsburgh appears to be the      first club to use the mechanical gear iconography in late 1910,      highlighting its city's growing industry. But the direct      forerunner of the official RI emblem came from the Rotary Club      of Philadelphia, which was developing its first emblem,      letterhead, and lapel pin designs around 1911. (The club also      foresaw the future in its design when it shortened the name of      the International Association of Rotary Clubs to \"Rotary      International\" ï¿½ a year before RI even starting using that      phrase.)\n \n \n \nNow that the emblem committee      had found its design, an official description of the wheel      emerged from Duluth. \"The emblem consists of ï¿½a wheel with gears      cut on the outer edge and the spokes separated sufficiently to      allowï¿½space to show the enamel [and define] the spokes.\" In the      original design, the spokes \"indicate strength\" while the gears      or cogs \"relieve the plainness of design\" and \"symbolize power\".\nDespite the official      description of the association's emblem, in the years that      followed, individual Rotary clubs continued to design their own      versions, diverging from the standard established in Duluth, to      the dismay of headquarters.\nTo address the problem, in      December 1918, the Board of Directors resolved to adopt the      gearwheel as the official corporate seal. Yet confusion still      reigned, and the Rotary wheel still was taking more than one      guise. Some sources count as many as 57 versions of Rotary      wheels by 1920. Even The Rotarian couldn't seem to get it      right: in three consecutive months in the spring of 1919, the      magazine added to the confusion by publishing three different      images of the wheel, each with an increasing number of gear      cogs.\nReality checks\nFor Charles Mackintosh and      Oscar Bjorge of the Rotary clubs of Chicago and Duluth, the      Rotary wheel was not running well. In a co-authored January 1920      article for The Rotarian titled \"Redesigning the Rotary      Wheel,\" they complained about the divergence of Rotary wheels      with ever-changing numbers of spokes and gear cogs and pleaded      for clubs to recognize the standard design. But there was also a      probem with that design: it was not mechanically sound.\nMackintosh and Bjorge      concluded that proportions of the wheel, including its small      teeth with large spaces in between each tooth, would make it      doubtful that the gear \"would get very far before every tooth in      the entire outfit would be stript [sic].\" The emblem seemed to      them to be \"the most impossible sprocket-wheel that only the      brain of an artist could conceive.\"\nThe re-engineered emblem they      drafted featured six spokes or arms and 24 teeth or cogs, not to      mention a more sturdy appearance. (The numbers of teeth and      spokes have no symbolic connection or significance to the      history of Rotary; rather, they were meant to give the      impression of a real, hardworking gear.)\nRotary had found its official      emblem. After the publication of the article, headquarters began      to take steps to adopt the redesigned wheel at the next      convention.\nBut there would be one last      criticism. As soon as the January 1920 issue of The Rotarian was published, another Rotarian, Will R. Forker of the Rotary      Club of Los Angeles, California, pointed out an additional      overlooked defect of the redesigned emblem. \"The hub design of      the new wheel is that of an idler wheel or gear, [as] there is      no provision for the reception of power to or from the shaft. My      idea of Rotary is not that it isï¿½an idler organizationï¿½but that      it is a real living force.\"\nForker suggested inserting a \"key way\" into the design's hub to make the new wheel a \"real      worker.\" The official specifications of the re-engineered,      mechanically correct Rotary wheel were approved by the RI Board      at their January 1924 meeting, and the new emblem, whose      official colors were royal blue and gold, has remained unchanged      ï¿½ and working ï¿½ ever since.\n\"Rotary is a vast machine\"\n \n \n \nTo Rotarians past and present,      the Rotary wheel has evoked the image of a well-oiled, efficient      machine, working for the service of mankind. \"The gearwheel is      truly emblematic of Rotary,\" wrote William E. Fulton, of the      Rotary Club of Waterbury, Connecticut, in the March 1920 issue      of The Rotarian. \"The wheel must be symmetrical ï¿½ well      proportioned throughout and so well balanced that it shall run      smooth and true. It is precisely that way with the Rotarian. We      do not think of a gearwheel as standing by itself. It has a      companion gearï¿½and stands for comradeship.\"\nThe Rev. E.K. Means of the      Rotary Club of Monroe, Louisiana, used the same imagery in an      editorial published later that year. \"Rotary is a vast machine      and every club a wheel. I firmly believe that all the great      machinery of Rotary represents a providential movement,\" Means      wrote. \"Our Rotary wheel means that our best gifts of service      are rolling always in the right direction.\"\nThe emblem's omnipresence in      Rotary from the earliest days of the first clubs also has left      an indelible mark on Rotarian culture. For example, the name of      the official magazine of Rotary International in Great Britain and Ireland for many years was The Rotary Wheel before it      was renamed simply Rotary. The comics and jokes section      of The Rotarian is still called \"Stripped Gears.\"\nUse of the Rotary wheel\nToday, Rotary's emblem not      only distinguishes Rotary in the community, but also helps      Rotarians identify each other and find clubs when traveling.\nThe Rotary emblem, like      Rotary's name, is a registered trademark, protected throughout      the world by Rotary International. These trademarks, among      numerous others owned by RI, are commonly referred to as the \"Rotary Marks.\"* RI encourages Rotary clubs, Rotary districts,      and other Rotary entities to use the Rotary emblem in      conjunction with the name of their clubs and districts when they      host or organize local projects or events.\n\"The Rotary emblem is      recognizable as the symbol of Rotary around the world,\" said      Jomarie Fredericks, intellectual property manager for legal      services at RI. \"Following the RI Board's guidelines for use of      the Rotary Marks will ensure that Rotarians will be able to use      them for generations to come.\"\nJoseph Derr      is Rotary International's Web writer.\nCopyright ï¿½      2003.
