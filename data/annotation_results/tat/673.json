        " | As of June 30, 2019 | As of July 1, 2018\n--- | --- | ---\nShort-term contract assets | $20,956 | $5,474\nLong-term contract assets | $15,386 | $12,382\nShort-term deferred revenue | $641,656 | $618,197\nLong-term deferred revenue | $46,974 | $64,743\n\nparagraph 1: Contract Balances\nparagraph 2: A contract asset will be recorded if we have recognized revenue but do not have an unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer. For example, this will be the case if implementation services offered in a cloud arrangement are identified as a separate performance obligation and are provided to a customer prior to us being able to bill the customer. In addition, a contract asset may arise in relation to subscription licenses if the license revenue that is recognized upfront exceeds the amount that we are able to invoice the customer at that time. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable when the rights become unconditional.\nparagraph 3: The balance for our contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e. deferred revenues) for the periods indicated below were as follows:\nparagraph 4: The difference in the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and deferred revenues primarily results from the timing difference between our performance and the customerâ€™s payments. We fulfill our obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we reclassified $19.2 million of contract assets to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional. During the year ended June 30, 2019, there was no significant impairment loss recognized related to contract assets.\nparagraph 5: We recognize deferred revenue when we have received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer for future obligations to transfer products or services. Our deferred revenues primarily relate to customer support agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services. The amount of revenue that was recognized during the year ended June 30, 2019 that was included in the deferred revenue balances at July 1, 2018 was approximately $617 million.\n"
