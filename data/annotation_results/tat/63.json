Also includes unallocated corporate income and expenses.\nparagraph 3: (2) Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and then recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year. The related cost of revenues is deferred and recognized as an expense as the related revenues are recognized. This table reflects the net effect from the deferrals of revenues and recognition of deferred revenues, along with the related cost of revenues, on certain of our online enabled products.\nparagraph 4: (3) Intersegment revenues reflect licensing and service fees charged between segments.\nparagraph 5: (4) Reflects restructuring initiatives, which include severance and other restructuring-related costs.\nparagraph 6: (5) Reflects the impact of other unusual or unique tax‑related items and activities.\n"
