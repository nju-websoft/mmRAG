(or TIL) vessels subsequent to Teekay Tankers' acquisition of TIL in late 2017.\nparagraph 8: Equity income increased to $2.3 million in 2019 from $1.2 million in 2018 primarily due to higher earnings recognized in 2019 from the High-Q Investment Ltd. joint venture as a result of higher spot rates earned in 2019.\n"
