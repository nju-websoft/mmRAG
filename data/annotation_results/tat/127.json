Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted to add back depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $46.3 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, due to the timing of working capital. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily for funding capital expenditures, lease payments, stock repurchases, and acquisitions.\nparagraph 5: Cash Flow from Investing Activities\nparagraph 6: During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $753.9 million, net of $0.1 million in cash acquired, to acquire Speedpay.

During 2019, we received proceeds of $500.0 million from our Delayed Draw Term Loan and $280.0 million from our Revolving Credit Facility to fund our purchase of Speedpay and stock repurchases, and we repaid $28.9 million on the Initial Term Loan and $41.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, we received proceeds of $16.6 million from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended, and used $4.0 million for the repurchase of stock-based compensation awards for tax withholdings. During 2019, we also used $35.6 million to repurchase common stock. During 2018, we received proceeds of $400.0 million from the issuance of the 2026 Notes.
