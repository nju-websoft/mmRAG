The Company did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment. The impairment test was conducted following a two-step process. In the first step, the Company compared the fair value of the reporting units tested to their carrying value. Based upon the first step of the goodwill impairment test, no impairment was recorded since the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value.\nparagraph 3: Goodwill as at December 31, 2019 and 2018 is net of accumulated impairment losses of $102 million, of which $96 million relates to the MDG segment and $6 million to Others. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, no impairment loss was recorded by the Company.\n"
