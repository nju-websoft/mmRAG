Consistent with accounting guidance, we have elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost and thus have not adjusted any net deferred tax assets of our foreign subsidiaries in connection with the Tax Act.\nparagraph 3: Due to the complexity of the Tax Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance in SAB 118 which clarified the accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 if certain information was not yet available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provided for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment of the Tax Act, during which time the required analyses and accounting must be completed. During fiscal year 2018, we recorded provisional amounts for the income tax effects of the changes in tax law and tax rates, as reasonable estimates were determined by management during this period. These amounts did not change in fiscal year 2019.\nparagraph 4: The SAB 118 measurement period ended on December 22, 2018. Although we no longer consider these amounts to be provisional, the determination of the Tax Act’s income tax effects may change following future legislation or further interpretation of the Tax Act based on the publication of recently proposed U.S. Treasury regulations and guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities.\nparagraph 5: Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes includes the following components (in thousands):\n"
