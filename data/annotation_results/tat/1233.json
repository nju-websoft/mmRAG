Income Taxes\nparagraph 2: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was signed into law on December 22, 2017. This legislation made significant changes in U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, changes to net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The legislation reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the enacted Tax Act, we were required to revalue deferred tax assets and liabilities at the rate in effect when the deferred tax balances are scheduled to reverse. This revaluation resulted in an additional $8.8 million of income tax expense and a corresponding reduction in the deferred tax asset which was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nparagraph 3: Additionally, on December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Specifically, SAB 118 provides a measurement period for companies to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act on their financial statements. We completed the accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and decreased our provisional estimate from $8.8 million to $8.7 million.\nparagraph 4: The components of our income tax expense are as follows (in thousands):\n"
