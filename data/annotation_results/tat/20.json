See Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on May 21, 2018, for Managementâ€™s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017.\nparagraph 3: REVENUE\nparagraph 4: Our overall revenue increased $116.8 million in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher demand for our mobile products in support of customers based in China as well as higher demand for our base station products, partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to weakness in marquee smartphone demand experienced by our largest end customer.\nparagraph 5: We provided our products to our largest end customer (Apple) through sales to multiple contract manufacturers, which in the aggregate accounted for 32% and 36% of total revenue in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Huawei accounted for approximately 13% and 8% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. These customers primarily purchase RF and Wi-Fi solutions for cellular base stations and a variety of mobile devices, including smartphones, wearables, laptops, tablets and cellular-based applications for the IoT. In May 2019, the U.S. government imposed restrictions on the sales of products to Huawei (see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report).\nparagraph 6: International shipments amounted to $2,610.0 million in fiscal 2019 (approximately 84% of revenue) compared to $2,449.1 million in fiscal 2018 (approximately 82% of revenue). Shipments to Asia totaled $2,446.3 million in fiscal 2019 (approximately 79% of revenue) compared to $2,329.3 million in fiscal 2018 (approximately 78% of revenue).\nparagraph 7: GROSS MARGIN\nparagraph 8: Gross margin was relatively flat for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, with average selling price erosion offset by favorable changes in product mix.\nparagraph 9: OPERATING EXPENSES\nparagraph 10: Research and Development\nparagraph 11: In fiscal 2019, R&D spending increased $5.4 million, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher personnel related costs, partially offset by lower product development spend driven by R&D efficiency initiatives.\nparagraph 12: Selling, General and Administrative\nparagraph 13: In fiscal 2019, selling, general and administrative expense decreased $51.7 million, or 9.8%, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower intangible amortization, partially offset by higher personnel related costs.\nparagraph 14: Other Operating Expense\nparagraph 15: In fiscal 2019, other operating expense was $52.2 million. In fiscal 2019, we recognized $15.9 million of asset impairment charges (to adjust the carrying value of certain property and equipment to reflect fair value) and $11.6 million of employee termination benefits as a result of restructuring actions (see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for information on restructuring actions). In fiscal 2019, we also recorded $18.0 million of start-up costs related to new processes and operations in existing facilities.\nparagraph 16: In fiscal 2018, other operating expense was $103.8 million. In fiscal 2018, we initiated restructuring actions to improve operating efficiencies, and, as a result of these actions, we recorded approximately $18.3 million of employee termination benefits and adjusted the carrying value of certain held for sale assets located in China and the U.S. to fair market value (resulting in impairment charges totaling approximately $46.3 million). In fiscal 2018, we also recorded integration costs and restructuring costs of $6.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, associated with the Business Combination, as well as $24.3 million of start-up costs related to new processes and operations in both existing and new facilities.\nparagraph 17: OPERATING INCOME\nparagraph 18: Our overall operating income was $216.5 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $70.3 million for fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily due to lower intangible amortization, higher revenue, and lower impairment charges on property and equipment.\n"
