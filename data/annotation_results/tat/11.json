Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and restricted stock-based awards using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nparagraph 3: All outstanding stock options and restricted stock-based awards in the amount of 1.0 million and 1.2 million, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 because the effect of inclusion would be antidilutive. Shares subject to anti-dilutive stock options and restricted stock-based awards of 1.9 million and 0.2 million for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share for the years then ended.\nparagraph 4: We have the option to pay cash, issue shares of common stock or any combination thereof for the aggregate amount due upon conversion of the Notes. It is our intent to settle the principal amount of the convertible senior notes with cash, and therefore, we use the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion option on diluted net income (loss) per share. From the time of the issuance of the Notes, the average market price of our common stock has been less than the initial conversion price of the Notes, and consequently no shares have been included in diluted earnings per share for the conversion value of the Notes.\n"
