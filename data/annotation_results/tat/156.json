        "Fiscal Year ended March 31, | US Plans | International Plans\n--- | --- | ---\n2020 | $2,295 | $7,055\n2021 | 2,333 | 7,197\n2022 | 2,353 | 7,337\n2023 | 2,371 | 7,624\n2024 | 2,388 | 7,624\n2025-2029 | 11,880 | 40,364\n\nparagraph 1: We make contributions to our defined benefit plans as required under various pension funding regulations. We expect to make contributions of approximately\n$1,420 to the international plans in fiscal 2020 based on current actuarial computations\nparagraph 2: Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:\nparagraph 3: Savings plans:\nparagraph 4: We sponsor retirement savings plans, which allow eligible employees to defer part of their annual compensation. Certain contributions by us are discretionary and\nare determined by our Board of Directors each year. Our contributions to the savings plans in the United States for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nwere approximately $4,367, $4,421, and $4,913, respectively.\nparagraph 5: We also sponsor a nonqualified deferred compensation program, which permits certain employees to annually elect to defer a portion of their compensation until\nretirement. A portion of the deferral is subject to a matching contribution by us. The employees select among various investment alternatives, which are the same as are\navailable under the retirement savings plans, with the investments held in a separate trust. The value of the participants’ balances fluctuate based on the performance of\nthe investments. The market value of the trust at March 31, 2018 and 2019 of $6,649 and $4,693, respectively, is included as an asset and a liability in our accompanying\nbalance sheet because the trust’s assets are both assets of the Company and a liability as they are available to general creditors in certain circumstances\n"
