The following table shows our manufacturing facilities by geographic region and our business segment reporting structure:\nparagraph 2: Other Property Information\nparagraph 3: We own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities. Some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements. We lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities, which are generally smaller sites. Our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products. Because of the relatively low density of our air cellular, polyethylene foam and protective mailer products, we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors.\nparagraph 4: We also occupy facilities containing sales, distribution, technical, warehouse or administrative functions at a number of\nlocations in the U.S. and in many foreign countries/regions. Some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some of these are leased. Stand-alone facilities of these types are generally leased. Our global headquarters is located in an owned property in Charlotte, North Carolina. For a list of those countries and regions outside of the U.S. where we have operations, see \"Global Operations\" above.\nparagraph 5: We believe that our manufacturing, warehouse, office and other facilities are well maintained, suitable for their purposes and adequate for our needs.\n"
