In addition, certain receivables and payables arise when we pay an invoice on behalf of a related party and vice versa. Receivables and payables are generally settled quarterly in arrears. Balances owing to or due from Golar Partners and its subsidiaries are unsecured, interest-free and intended to be settled in the ordinary course of business. In November 2019, we loaned $15.0 million to Golar Partners, with interest of LIBOR plus 5.0%. The loan was fully repaid, including interest of $0.1 million, in December 2019.\nparagraph 3: (vii) Methane Princess lease security deposit movements - This represents net advances from Golar Partners since its IPO, which correspond with the net release of funds from the security deposits held relating to a lease for the Methane Princess. This is in connection with the Methane Princess tax lease indemnity provided to Golar Partners under the Omnibus Agreement. Accordingly, these amounts will be settled as part of the eventual termination of the Methane Princess lease.\n"
