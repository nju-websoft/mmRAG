        " | For the Years Ended | December 31, | \n--- | --- | --- | ---\n | 2019 | 2018 | Increase (Decrease)\nNet cash provided by operating activities | $1,831 | $1,790 | $41\nNet cash used in investing activities | (22) | (230) | 208\nNet cash used in financing activities | (237) | (2,020) | 1,783\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes | (3) | (31) | 28\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash | $1,569 | $(491) | $2,060\n\nparagraph 1: Liquidity and Capital Resources\nparagraph 2: We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.9 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as potential dividend payments or share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.\nparagraph 3: As of December 31, 2019, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $2.8 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2018. These cash balances are generally available for use in the U.S., subject in some cases to certain restrictions.\nparagraph 4: Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.\nparagraph 5: Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions)\n"
