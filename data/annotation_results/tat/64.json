Sane Trilogy, which was released on the Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch in June 2018.\nparagraph 8: The decrease was partially offset by: • revenues recognized from Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, which was released in June 2019; • revenues from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which was released in March 2019; and • higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which was released in October 2019, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.\n"
