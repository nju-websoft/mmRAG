        "(Dollars in Millions) | April 27, 2019 | April 28, 2018\n--- | --- | ---\nRevolving Credit Facility | $35.0 | $30.0\nTerm Loan | 243.7 | —\nSubsidiary Credit Facility | — | 3.6\nOther Debt | 16.8 | 24.2\nUnamortized Debt Issuance Costs | (2.9) | —\nTotal Debt | 292.6 | 57.8\nLess: Current Maturities | (15.7) | (4.4)\nTotal Long-term Debt | $276.9 | $53.4\n\nparagraph 1: 10. Debt\nparagraph 2: A summary of debt is shown below:\nparagraph 3: Revolving Credit Facility/Term Loan\nparagraph 4: On September 12, 2018, the Company entered into five-year Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the credit agreement, dated November 18, 2016, among the Company, Bank of America, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The Credit Agreement consists of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) of $200.0 million and a senior unsecured term loan (“Term Loan”) of $250.0 million. In addition, the Company has an option to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan by up to an additional $200.0 million. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries. For the Term Loan, the Company is required to make quarterly principal payments of 1.25% of the original Term Loan ($3.1 million) through maturity, with the remaining balance due on September 12, 2023.\nparagraph 5: Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates based on the type of borrowing and the Company’s debt to EBITDA financial ratio, as defined. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 3.98% at April 27, 2019. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, financial covenants, restrictive covenants and events of default. As of April 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants in the Credit Agreement. The fair value of borrowings under the Credit Agreement approximates book value because the interest rate is variable.\nparagraph 6: Subsidiary Credit Facility\nparagraph 7: The Company’s subsidiary, Pacific Insight, is a party to a credit agreement with the Bank of Montreal which provides a credit facility in the maximum principal amount of C$10.0 million, with an option to increase the principal amount by up to an additional C$5.0 million. Availability under the facility is based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and finished goods inventory balances. Interest is calculated at a base rate plus margin, as defined. In addition, Pacific Insight was a party to a credit agreement with Roynat which was terminated during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Total repayments under the credit agreement with Roynat were $3.8 million in fiscal 2019, including a prepayment fee of $0.1 million.\nparagraph 8: Other Debt\nparagraph 9: The Company’s subsidiary, Procoplast, has debt that consists of eighteen notes with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2031. The weighted-average interest rate was approximately 1.5% at April 27, 2019 and $3.2 million of the debt was classified as short-term. The fair value of other debt was $16.3 million at April 27, 2019 and was based on Level 2 inputs on a nonrecurring basis.\nparagraph 10: Unamortized Debt Issuance Costs\nparagraph 11: The Company paid debt issuance costs of $3.1 million on September 12, 2018 in connection with the Credit Agreement. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the five-year term of the Credit Agreement.\n"
