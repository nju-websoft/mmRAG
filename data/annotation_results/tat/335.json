Financial assets are individually assessed as to whether the credit risk has increased significantly in the period and therefore whether there is a need to apply the lifetime expected credit losses model as opposed to the 12-month expected credit loss model.\nparagraph 5: At 31 December 2019 there is no loss allowance recognised for other financial assets as it has been concluded as an immaterial risk of credit loss on other financial assets.\nparagraph 6: – cash deposits and derivative financial instruments\nparagraph 7: The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Group’s treasury department. Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties (between BBB+ and AAA).\nparagraph 8: Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.\n"
