Results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 2% in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior-year period, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in sales volumes reflected a reduction in promotional intensity, planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing products, retailer inventory reductions, which were higher than anticipated, and deliberate actions to optimize distribution on certain lower-margin products, consistent with the Company's value over volume strategy. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior-year period as favorable mix improvements from recent innovation and higher net pricing nearly offset continued investments in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $68.1 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition contributed $8.6 million and the Thanasi acquisition contributed $66.5 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversaries of the acquisitions. The Frontera and Thanasi acquisitions occurred in September 2016 and April 2017, respectively.\nparagraph 5: Refrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2018 were $2.75 billion, an increase of $100.3 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected a 3% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2017, excluding the impact of 31 acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of brand renovation and innovation launches. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2017, as favorability in both net pricing and mix offset continued investment in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business contributed $21.3 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition, which occurred in September 2016, and subsequent innovation in the Frontera® brand contributed $4.4 million during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\nparagraph 6: International net sales for fiscal 2018 were $843.5 million, an increase of $27.5 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected a 3% decrease in volume, a 3% increase due to foreign exchange rates, and a 3% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2017. The volume decrease for fiscal 2018 was driven by strategic decisions to eliminate lower margin products and to reduce promotional intensity. The increase in price/mix compared to the prior-year period was driven by improvements in pricing and trade productivity.\nparagraph 7: Foodservice net sales for fiscal 2018 were $1.05 billion, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected an 11% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 9% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in volumes compared to the prior year primarily reflected the impact of exiting a non-core business, the planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing businesses, and softness in certain categories. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2018 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value over volume strategy.\nparagraph 8: In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we divested our Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. These businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations. Accordingly, there were no net sales in the Commercial segment after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These businesses had net sales of $71.1 million in fiscal 2017 prior to the completion of the divestitures.\n"
