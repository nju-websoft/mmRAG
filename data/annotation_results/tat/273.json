Contributions in respect of share-based payments are recognised in line with the policy set out in note 7 “Share-based payments”.\nparagraph 4: The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\nparagraph 5: Shares in Group undertakings\n"
