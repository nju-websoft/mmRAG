The increase was primarily due to a $15.5 million increase in employee-related costs, which includes stock-based compensation, associated with our increased headcount from 286 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 345 employees as of December 31, 2019. The remaining increase was principally the result of a $1.2 million increase in trade show and advertising costs and a $1.0 million increase attributed to office related expenses to support the sales team.\n"
