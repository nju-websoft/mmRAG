The reconciling items represent the impact of rate differentials in tax jurisdictions and the impact of non-taxable benefits and non-deductible expenses arising from differences between the local tax base and the reported Financial Statements.\nparagraph 2: The Group’s taxation strategy is published at www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/legal/sophos-group-tax-poli\nThe Group’s taxation strategy is published at www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/legal/sophos-group-tax-policyfy19. pdf and is aligned to its business strategy and operational needs. Oversight of taxation is within the remit of the Audit and Risk Committee. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for tax strategy supported by a global team of tax professionals. Sophos strives for an open and transparent relationship with all revenue authorities and is vigilant in ensuring that the Group complies with current tax legislation. The Group proactively seeks to agree arm’s length pricing with tax authorities to mitigate tax risks of significant cross-border operations. The Group actively engages with policy makers, tax administrators, industry bodies and international institutions to provide informed input on proposed tax measures, so that it and they can understand how those proposals would affect the Group. However, a tax authority may seek adjustment to the filing position adopted by a Group company and it is accepted that interpretation of complex regulations may lead to additional tax being assessed. Uncertain tax positions are monitored regularly and a provision made in the accounts where appropriate.\n"
