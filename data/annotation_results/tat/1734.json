Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\nparagraph 12: Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\nparagraph 13: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable  fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable\nparagraph 14: - variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate\nparagraph 15: - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees\nparagraph 16: - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and\nparagraph 17: - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\nparagraph 18: The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.\nparagraph 19: Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\nparagraph 20: - the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability\nparagraph 21: - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received\nparagraph 22: - any initial direct costs, and\nparagraph 23: - restoration costs.\nparagraph 24: Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment and small items of office furniture.\nparagraph 25: (iv) Extension and termination options\nparagraph 26: Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These terms are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.\n"
