Net debt is calculated as total bank debt and lease financing, less unamortised debt fees and cash and cash equivalents as shown in note 32. Total equity is as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet.\nparagraph 3: The calculation of total capital is shown in the table below:\nparagraph 4: Following the application of IFRS 16, total capital for the year ended 31 March 2018 has been restated (note 2).\nparagraph 5: The objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to optimise the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or take other steps to increase share capital and reduce or increase debt facilities.\nparagraph 6: As at 31 March 2019, the Group had borrowings of £313.0m (2018: £343.0m) through its Syndicated revolving credit facility (2018: Syndicated Term Loan). Interest is payable on this facility at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.2% and 2.1% depending on the consolidated leverage ratio of Auto Trader Group plc and its subsidiaries, which is calculated and reviewed on a biannual basis. The Group remains in compliance with its banking covenants.\n"
