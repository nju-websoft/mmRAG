We finance our operations primarily through sales to our customers and a majority of our customers are billed monthly. For customers with annual or multi-year contracts and those who opt for annual invoicing, we generally invoice only one annual period in advance and all invoicing occurs at the start of the respective subscription period. Revenue is deferred for such advanced billings. We also finance our operations from proceeds from issuance of stock under our stock plans, and proceeds from issuance of debt. We believe that our operations and existing liquidity sources will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months\nparagraph 3: Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including revenue growth and costs incurred to support customer growth, acquisitions and expansions, sales and marketing, research and development, increased general and administrative expenses to support the anticipated growth in our operations, and capital equipment required to support our growing headcount and in support of our co-location data center facilities. Our capital expenditures in future periods are expected to grow in line with our business. We continually evaluate our capital needs and may decide to raise additional capital to fund the growth of our business, to further strengthen our balance sheet, or for general corporate purposes through public or private equity offerings or through additional debt financing. We also may in the future make investments in or acquire businesses or technologies that could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Access to additional capital may not be available, or on favorable terms\nparagraph 4: The table below provides selected cash flow information for the periods indicated (in thousands)\n"
