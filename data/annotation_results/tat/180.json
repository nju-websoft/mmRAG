While higher loans receivable and receivables from finance leases from new business at SFS contributed also to growth in other financial assets, a large extent of the overall increase resulted from increased fair values of derivative financial instruments.\nparagraph 4: Inventories increased in several industrial businesses, with the build-up most evident at SGRE, Mobility and Siemens Healthineers.\nparagraph 5: Assets classified as held for disposal increased mainly due to reclassification of two investments from investments accounted for using the equity method.\nparagraph 6: The increase in goodwill included the acquisition of Mendix.\nparagraph 7: Deferred tax assets increased mainly due to income tax effects related to remeasurement of defined benefits plans.\nparagraph 8: The increase in other assets was driven mainly by higher net defined benefit assets from actuarial gains.\n"
