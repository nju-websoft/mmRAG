The LTI Plans will be measured against one performance measure â€“ relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). LTI Plan shares that do not vest after testing of the relevant performance measure, lapse without retesting.\nparagraph 4: The shares will only vest if a certain Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the designated comparator group, being the ASX Small Ordinaries Index excluding mining and energy companies, is achieved during the performance period. In relation to the offer, vesting starts where relative TSR reaches the 50th Percentile.\nparagraph 5: At the 50th Percentile, 50% of LTI Plan shares will vest. All LTI Plan shares will vest if relative TSR is above the 75th Percentile. Between these points, the percentage of vesting increases on a straight-line basis.\nparagraph 6: Summary of Shares issued under the FY2017 LTI Plan\nparagraph 7: The following table illustrates the number of, and movements in, shares issued during the year:\n"
