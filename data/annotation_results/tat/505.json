Consequently, the disaggregation below is based on contract type.\nparagraph 3: Since the terms within these contract types are generally standard in nature, the Company does not believe that further disaggregation would result in increased insight into the economic factors impacting revenue and cash flows.\nparagraph 4: The following table shows the Company's shipping revenues disaggregated by nature of the charter arrangement for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nparagraph 5: (1) Voyage charter revenues include approximately $10,152 and $7,600 of revenue related to short-term time charter contracts for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n"
