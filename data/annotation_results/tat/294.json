Operating lease commitments\nparagraph 2: The Group has lease agreements in respect of property, plant and equipment, for which future minimum payments extend over a number of years.\nparagraph 3: Leases primarily relate to the Group’s properties, which principally comprise offices and factories. Lease payments are typically subject to market review every five years to reflect market rentals, but because of the uncertainty over the amount of any future changes, such changes have not been reflected in the table below. Within our leasing arrangements there are no significant contingent rental, renewal, purchase or escalation clauses.\nparagraph 4: The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases for continuing operations are as follows:\nparagraph 5: The Group has made provision for the aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases. The Group sub-lets various properties under non-cancellable lease arrangements. Sub-lease receipts of £0.2m (2017/18: £0.2m) were recognised in the statement of profit or loss during the period. The total future minimum sub-lease payments at the period end is £0.2m (2017/18: £0.2m).\n"
