Excluding the impact of the SSC contract, postpaid gross activations were higher year over year, driven by our mobile network quality, strong sales execution and focus on subscriber base management. • Prepaid gross activations increased by 61.9% in 2019, compared to last year, driven by the continued growth from Lucky Mobile along with the benefit from the national retail distribution of Lucky Mobile and Virgin Mobile prepaid services at Dollarama stores\nparagraph 8: Blended wireless churn of 1.39% increased by 0.07 pts in 2019, compared to 2018. • Postpaid churn of 1.13% improved by 0.03 pts in 2019, compared to last year, driven by the favourable impact from our ongoing investments in customer retention and network speeds • Prepaid churn of 4.44% increased by 1.27 pts in 2019, compared to the prior year, due to greater competitive intensity in the discount mobile market and the impact from the harmonization of our prepaid deactivation policy across all Bell Wireless brands from 120 days for Bell and Virgin Mobile and 150 days for Lucky Mobile to 90 days\nparagraph 9: Net activations grew by 7.4% in 2019, compared to 2018, due to higher prepaid net activations, moderated by lower postpaid net activations. • Postpaid net activations decreased by 10.2% in 2019, compared to 2018, driven by lower gross activations • Prepaid net activations increased by 81,325 in 2019, compared to last year, due to higher gross activations, offset in part by greater customer deactivations\nparagraph 10: Wireless subscribers at December 31, 2019 totaled 9,957,962, an increase of 3.6% from 9,610,482 subscribers reported at the end of 2018. This was comprised of 9,159,940 postpaid subscribers and 798,022 prepaid subscribers, an increase of 3.7% and 2.3%, respectively, year over year. At the end of 2019, the proportion of Bell Wireless customers subscribing to our postpaid service was stable at 92%, compared to last year. At the beginning of Q1 2019, we adjusted our wireless subscriber base to remove 167,929 subscribers (72,231 postpaid and 95,698 prepaid) as follows: • 65,798 subscribers (19,195 postpaid and 46,603 prepaid), due to the completion of the shutdown of the CDMA network on April 30, 2019 • 49,095 prepaid subscribers as a result of a change to our deactivation policy, mainly from 120 days for Bell/Virgin Mobile and 150 days for Lucky Mobile to 90 days • 43,670 postpaid subscribers relating to IoT due to the further refinement of our subscriber definition as a result of the technology evolution • 9,366 postpaid fixed wireless Internet subscribers which were transferred to our retail high-speed Internet subscriber base\n"
