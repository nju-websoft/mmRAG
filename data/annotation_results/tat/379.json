The decrease was primarily due to:\n• lower contribution recognized from our participation in the Cool Pool due to lower utilization and a higher number of drydocking days for our vessels for the year ended December 31, 2019;\n• $24.9 million of drydocking costs as the majority of our fleet was scheduled for dry-dock during 2019;\n• $9.3 million in cash receipts in connection with arbitration proceedings with a former charterer of the Golar Tundra, compared to $50.7 million recovered in 2018; and\n• the reduction in the general timing of working capital in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.\nparagraph 5: This was partially offset by receipts of $4.0 million in relation to a loss of hire insurance claim on the Golar Viking. There were no comparable receipts in 2018.\nparagraph 6: Cash provided by operating activities increased by $151.8 million to $116.7 million in 2018 compared to cash utilized of $35.1 million in 2017. The increase in cash utilized in 2018 was primarily due to: • higher contributions recognized from our participation in the Cool Pool as a result of improved utilization and daily hire rates from the Cool Pool vessels; • lower charterhire payments as a result of the expiry of the charter-back arrangement of the Golar Grand from Golar Partners in November 2017; • $50.7 million in cash receipts in connection with arbitration proceedings with a former charterer of the Golar Tundra; and • the improvement on the general timing of working capital in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nparagraph 7: Net cash used in investing activities\nparagraph 8: Net cash used in investing activities of $264.4 million in 2019 comprised mainly of:\n• $376.3 million of payments made in respect of the conversion of the Gimi into a FLNG;\n• $21.0 million additional investments in Golar Power and Avenir; and\n• $24.4 million of payments predominately for the installation of the ballast water treatment systems on eight of our vessels.\nparagraph 9: This was partially offset by receipts of:\n• $115.2 million of proceeds from Keppel's initial subscription and subsequent cash calls in relation to its 30% equity interest in Gimi MS;\n• $29.2 million of dividends received from Golar Partners; and\n• $9.7 million of cash consideration received from Golar Partners in respect of the remaining net purchase price less working capital adjustments in connection with the Hilli acquisition.\nparagraph 10: Net cash used in investing activities of $202.5 million in 2018 comprised mainly of:\n• the addition of $116.7 million to asset under development relating to payments made in respect of the conversion of the Hilli into a FLNG; and\n• additions of $95.5 million to investments in affiliates, which relates principally to capital contributions made to Golar Power of $55.0 million and our investment in Avenir of $24.8 million; and\n• additions to vessels and equipment of $33.1 million.\nparagraph 11: This was partially offset by: • receipt of $9.7 million from Golar Partners in relation to the Hilli Disposal; and • $33.2 million of dividends received from Golar Partners.\nparagraph 12: Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities\nparagraph 13: Net cash used in financing activities is principally generated from funds from new debt, debt refinancings, debt repayments and cash dividends. Net cash used in financing activities of $136.0 million in 2019 arose primarily due to: • scheduled debt repayments of $443.1 million; • $100.0 million repayment of the Margin Loan following refinancing; • $9.1 million repayment upon the extension of the Golar Arctic facility; • payment of dividends of $65.0 million; • financing costs of $24.5 million predominately in relation to the Gimi debt facility; and • payment of $18.6 million in relation to the 1.5 million treasury shares repurchased on our equity swap in November 2019.\nparagraph 14: This was partially offset by debt proceeds drawn down of:\n• $100.0 million on the new Margin Loan facility;\n• $150.0 million on the term loan facility;\n• $130.0 million on the Gimi facility; and\n• $144.3 million in relation to our lessor VIE's.\nparagraph 15: Net cash provided by financing activities of $177.4 million in 2018 arose primarily due to proceeds of $1.2 billion from our debt facilities, including:\n• $115.0 million further drawdown on the pre-delivery financing in relation to the conversion of the Hilli into a FLNG;\n• $960.0 million drawdown on the post-acceptance Hilli sale and leaseback financing in relation to the Hilli Facility; and\n• $101.0 million of debt proceeds drawn down by the lessor VIE, which owns the Golar Crystal, upon refinancing of its debt into a long-term loan facility. See note 5 \"Variable Interest Entities\" of our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nparagraph 16: This was partially offset by:\n• loan repayments of $994.9 million, which includes (i) the repayment of $640.0 million on the pre-delivery financing in relation to the conversion of the Hilli into a FLNG, (ii) payment of $105.0 million in connection with the refinancing of the Golar Crystal facility mentioned above, (iii) payments of $76.9 million in connection with the Golar Tundra financing arrangement and (iv) scheduled repayments on our remaining debt facilities; and\n• payment of dividends of $42.9 million.\n"
