RSA #17 provides cellular service to a limited rural area in Texas.\nparagraph 2: RSA 6(I) and RSA 6(II) provide cellular service in and around our Pennsylvania service territory. Because we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these three entities, we account for the investments using the equity method. In connection with the adoption of ASC 606 by our equity method partnerships, the value of our combined partnership interests increased $1.8 million, which is reflected in the cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nparagraph 3: In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we received cash distributions from these partnerships totaling $19.0 million, $21.8 million and $17.2 million, respectively. The carrying value of the investments exceeds the underlying equity in net assets of the partnerships by $32.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nparagraph 4: The combined results of operations and financial position of our three equity investments in the cellular limited partnerships are summarized below:\n"
