In the fourth quarter of 2019, on a year-overyear basis, the TAM decreased by approximately 6%, while the SAM increased by approximately 2%. Sequentially, the TAM increased by approximately 1%, while the SAM decreased by approximately 3%.\nparagraph 3: Our 2019 financial performance, with net revenues of $9.56 billion, gross margin of 38.7% and operating margin of 12.6% is aligned with the full year expectations we provided in April 2019.\nparagraph 4: We closed 2019 with a solid fourth quarter sales and financial performance. In the fourth quarter, net revenues were up 4.0% year-over-year, gross margin reached 39.3%, and operating margin was 16.7%. On a sequential basis, fourth quarter revenues grew by 7.9%, with all product group contributing to the growth, and 290 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance. Our quarterly performance was above the SAM both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.\nparagraph 5: Our effective average exchange rate was $1.14 for €1.00 for the full year 2019, as compared to $1.18 for €1.00 for the full year 2018. Our effective average exchange rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.12 for €1.00, compared to $1.14 for €1.00 for the third quarter of 2019 and $1.17 for €1.00 in the fourth quarter of 2018. For a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements and the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates, see “Impact of Changes in Exchange Rates”.\nparagraph 6: Our 2019 gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 38.7% from 40.0% in 2018 mainly due to normal price pressure and increased unsaturation charges, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies, better product mix, and favorable currency effects, net of hedging.\nparagraph 7: Our fourth quarter 2019 gross margin was 39.3%, 110 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance, improving sequentially by 140 basis points, mainly driven by improved product mix and better manufacturing efficiencies. Our gross margin decreased 70 basis points year-over-year, mainly impacted by price pressure and unsaturation charges, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies, better product mix and favorable currency effects, net of hedging.\nparagraph 8: Our operating expenses, comprised of SG&A and R&D expenses, amounted to $2,591 million in 2019, increasing by about 3.9% from $2,493 million in the prior year, mainly due to salary dynamic, increased spending in certain R&D programs and higher share-based compensation cost, partially offset by favorable currency effects, net of hedging. Combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $672 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $629 million and $630 million in the prior and year-ago quarters, respectively. The sequential increase was mainly due to seasonality and salary dynamic. The year-over-year increase of operating expenses was mainly due to salary dynamic and increased activity on certain R&D programs, and was partially offset by favorable currency effects, net of hedging.\nparagraph 9: Other income and expenses, net, was $103 million in 2019 compared to $53 million in 2018, mainly due to a higher level of R&D grants, mainly benefitting from the grants associated with the programs part of the European Commission IPCEI in Italy and in France. Fourth quarter other income and expenses, net, was $54 million compared to negative $2 million in the prior quarter and $16 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting higher R&D grants in Italy associated with the IPCEI program.\nparagraph 10: In 2019, impairment and restructuring charges were $5 million compared to $21 million in 2018. Impairment and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter were $3 million compared to nil in the prior quarter and $2 million in the year-ago quarters.\nparagraph 11: Operating income in 2019 was $1,203 million, decreasing by $197 million compared to 2018, mainly driven by normal price pressure, increased unsaturation charges and higher R&D spending, partially offset by higher level of grants and favorable currency effects, net of hedging. Operating income in the fourth quarter grew on a sequential and year-over-year basis to $460 million compared to $336 million and $443 million in the prior quarter and year-ago quarters, respectively, mainly driven by higher revenues, improved product mix and a higher level of grants.\n"
