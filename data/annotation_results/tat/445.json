Approximately $14.8 million of the fair value of the replacement awards granted to Pinnacle employees was attributable to pre-combination service and was included in the purchase price and established as a liability. As of May 26, 2019, the liability of the replacement stock appreciation rights was $0.9 million, which includes post-combination service expense, the mark-to-market of the liability, and the impact of payouts since acquisition.\nparagraph 3: The compensation income for our cash-settled stock appreciation rights totaled $13.7 million for fiscal 2019. Included in this amount is income of $14.0 million related to the mark-to-market of the liability established in connection with the Pinnacle acquisition and expense of $0.2 million for accelerated vesting of awards related to Pinnacle integration restructuring activities, net of the impact of marking-to-market these awards based on a lower market price of Conagra common shares. The related tax expense for fiscal 2019 was $3.4 million.\nparagraph 4: A summary of the stock appreciation rights activity as of May 26, 2019 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below:\n"
