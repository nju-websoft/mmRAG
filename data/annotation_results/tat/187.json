We have provided a valuation allowance of $111 million for deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses that are not expected to be realized.\nparagraph 3: As of July 27, 2019, our federal, state, and foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $25 million, $1.1 billion, and $5 million, respectively. The federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2020. The majority of state and foreign tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
