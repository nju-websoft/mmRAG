Deferred tax assets (liabilities) were comprised of the following:\nparagraph 2: At January 3, 2020, the Company had state net operating losses of $77 million and state tax credits of $7 million. Both will begin to expire in fiscal 2020; however, the Company expects to utilize $24 million and $7 million of these state net operating losses and state tax credits, respectively. The Company also had foreign net operating losses of $44 million, which do not expire. The Company expects to utilize $9 million of these foreign net operating losses.\nparagraph 3: Our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $20 million and $28 million as of January 3, 2020 and December 28, 2018, respectively. The valuation allowance decreased by $8 million primarily due to the sale of the commercial cybersecurity business and releases related to the expected utilization of certain carryover attributes, partially offset by an increase related to foreign withholding taxes.\n"

                "Answer Analysis": "The answer is -11, indicating a decrease in reserves by 11 units.",
                "Document Content Analysis": "The document provides details of various reserves including translation reserve, net investment hedge reserve, cash flow hedges reserve, capital redemption reserve, and employee benefit trust reserve, with changes recorded for the year 2019.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document contains 'change', 'reserves'. It does not specifically mention the years 2018 or 2020 but mentions 2019 implying one of the years in the query's range.",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document includes a change in reserves but does not directly show -11 over the range. The 'Total other reserves' shows a decrease of (32.8) in 2019 but not over the entire range requested.",
                "Key Information Matching": "While the document provides detailed changes in reserves for 2019, it does not extend to 2020 or go back to 2018, therefore failing to cover the entire period of the query.",
                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not provide information that spans from 2018 to 2020, only covering changes through 2019.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Partially, it provides insight into reserve changes for 2019, which could be part of calculating a multi-year figure, but it lacks data for 2018 and 2020.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "1",
                "Explanation": "The document provides partial information relevant to the query as it details reserve changes for the year 2019 but does not encompass the full timeframe required by the query (2018 to 2020), nor does it directly provide the answer of -11."
