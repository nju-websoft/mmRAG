Properties\nparagraph 2: The Company operates out of several facilities located around the world. Each facility is used for manufacturing its products and for administrative activities. The following table presents the location, size and terms of ownership/occupation:\nparagraph 3: The Company’s facility located in Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York, is part of the building that the Company constructed in 1981 and expanded in 1988 on land leased from Nassau County. In January 1998, the Company sold this building and the related land lease to Reckson Associates Realty Corp. (“Reckson”), leasing back the space that it presently occupies.\nparagraph 4: The Company leased its manufacturing and office space from Reckson under an initial 11-year lease followed by two five-year renewal periods which ended in January 2019. On July 25, 2018, the Company signed an amendment to the lease with RA 55 CLB LLC (as successor-in-interest to Reckson) which extended the current lease terms ten years and eight months through September 30, 2029. Pursuant to the amendment to the lease agreement, the Company shall pay a gradually increasing annual rent of $1,046,810 in 2019 to $1,276,056 in 2029. The Company believes the leased space is adequate to meet the Company’s domestic operational needs which encompass the principal operations of the FEI-NY segment and also serves as the Company’s world-wide corporate headquarters.\nparagraph 5: The Garden Grove, California facility is leased by the Company’s subsidiary, FEI-Zyfer. The facility consists of a combination office and manufacturing space. The Company has signed a second amendment to the lease, which extends the lease an additional 88 months, beginning October 1, 2017 and expiring January 31, 2025. The average annual rent over the period of the amendment is approximately $312,000. The Company believes the leased space is adequate to meet FEI-Zyfer’s operational needs.\nparagraph 6: The Tianjin, China facility is the location of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, FEI-Asia. The subsidiary’s office and manufacturing facility is located in the Tianjin Free-Trade Zone. The lease was renewable annually with monthly rent of $8,500 through August 2019. As mentioned in Footnote 3, below, FEI-Asia was sold on May 21, 2019 and as a result the lease commitment transferred with the sale.\nparagraph 7: FEI-Elcom entered into a new lease agreement on February 1, 2018 regarding its Northvale, New Jersey facility. The facility consists of a combination office and manufacturing space. The lease, which expires in January 31, 2021, requires monthly payments of $9,673. The Company believes the leased space is adequate to meet FEI-Elcom’s operational needs.\n"
