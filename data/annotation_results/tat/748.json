In addition to higher LIBOR rates, this was primarily due to:\n• $22.7 million increase in interest expense arising on the loan facilities of our consolidated lessor VIEs (refer to note 5 \"Variable Interest Entities (\"VIE\")\" of our consolidated financial statements included herein), in particular on the Hilli post-delivery sale and leaseback arrangement entered into during June 2018;\n• $21.7 million lower capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in the Hilli FLNG conversion prior to acceptance of the vessel;\n• $7.0 million increase in amortization of deferred financing costs in relation to the Hilli facility; and\n• $1.4 million increase in interest expense in relation to the $402.5 million convertible bond issued in February 2017, resulting in a full year of interest incurred in 2018.\nparagraph 5: This was partially offset by a decrease of:\n• $5.9 million in interest expense relating to the Hilli disposal; and\n• $5.0 million higher capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in Golar Power.\nparagraph 6: (Losses)/gains on derivative instruments: Losses on derivative instruments increased by $51.2 million to a loss of $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gain of $20.7 million for the same period in 2017. The movement was primarily due to:\nparagraph 7: Net unrealized and realized gains on interest rate swap agreements: As of December 31, 2018, we have an interest rate swap portfolio with a notional amount of $950 million, none of which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Net unrealized gains on the interest rate swaps decreased to a gain of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gain of $6.6 million for the same period in 2017, due to an improvement in the long-term swap rates, offset by the decreased notional value of the swap portfolio over the period. Realized gains on our interest rate swaps increased to a gain of $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a loss of $3.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher LIBOR rates for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nparagraph 8: Unrealized (losses) gains on Total Return Swap (or equity swap): In December 2014, we established a three month facility for a Stock Indexed Total Return Swap Programme or Equity Swap Line with DNB Bank ASA in connection with a share buyback scheme. The facility has been extended to June 2019. The equity swap derivatives mark-to-market adjustment resulted in a net loss of $30.7 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gain of $16.6 million for the same period in 2017. The loss in 2018 is due to the fall in our share price during 2018.\nparagraph 9: Unrealized mark-to-market losses on Earn-Out Units: This relates to the mark-to-market movement on the Earn-Out Units issuable in connection with the IDR reset transaction in October 2016, which we recognize as a derivative asset in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in Golar Partners' quarterly distribution to $0.4042 per common unit on October 24, 2018 resulted in the contingent Earn-Out Units arising out of the IDR reset transaction in October 2016 not crystallizing and, accordingly, we recognized a mark-to-market loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, effectively reducing the derivative asset to $nil at December 31, 2018, compared to a gain of $0.4 million for the same period in 2017.\nparagraph 10: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests: The net income attributable to non-controlling interests comprises of (i) $19.7 million and $1.5 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Hilli LLC and Hilli Corp (prior to the incorporation of Hilli LLC) for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and (ii) $43.5 million and $32.9 million in relation to the equity interests in our lessor VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n"
