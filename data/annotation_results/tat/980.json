The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan charges relate to workforce reductions and facility consolidations. These charges require management to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of restructuring charges or recoveries. Our estimated liability could change subsequent to its recognition, requiring adjustments to the expense and the liability recorded. On a quarterly basis, we conduct an evaluation of the related liabilities and expenses and revise our assumptions and estimates as appropriate.\nparagraph 3: As of June 30, 2019, we expect total costs to be incurred in conjunction with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan to be approximately $30.0 million, of which $28.3 million has already been recorded within \"Special charges (recoveries)\" to date. We do not expect to incur any further significant charges relating to this plan.\nparagraph 4: A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for the year ended June 30, 2019 is shown below.\n"

It includes data on costs associated with these activities, including accruals and adjustments, cash payments, non-cash adjustments, and foreign exchange impacts.

                "Explanation": "The document contains significant contextual information about workplace reduction and facility costs in the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan. However, it stops short of explicitly discussing the conceptual difference between the two terms. While the information helps infer indirect answers or understand the query better, it cannot fully satisfy the specific query on its own. Therefore, the document is partially relevant."
