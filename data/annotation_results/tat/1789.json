        " |  | Years Ended December 31, | \n--- | --- | --- | ---\n | 2019 | 2018 | Increase / (Decrease)\nNet revenue | $ 41.8 | $ 45.4 | $ (3.6)\nCost of revenue | 23.5 | 28.5 | (5.0)\nSelling, general and administrative | 26.4 | 37.3 | (10.9)\nDepreciation and amortization | 6.3 | 3.3 | 3.0\nOther operating (income) expense | (3.0) | 0.3 | (3.3)\nLoss from operations | $ (11.4) | $ (24.0) | $ 12.6\n\nparagraph 1: Net revenue: Net revenue from our Broadcasting segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $3.6 million to $41.8 million from $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the second half of 2018, the Broadcasting segment undertook targeted cost cutting measures, primarily at HC2 Network Inc. (\"Network\") where Broadcasting exited certain local business operations and made strategic changes to the programming mix.\nparagraph 2: The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower local advertising sales as a result of such restructuring. This was partially offset by higher broadcast stations revenue associated with stations acquired during and subsequent to the comparable period.\nparagraph 3: Cost of revenue: Cost of revenue from our Broadcasting segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $5.0 million to $23.5 million from $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The overall decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in audience measurement costs as a result of the exit of certain local markets which were unprofitable at Network and a decrease in programming costs due to changes in the programming mix referenced above, partially offset by higher cost of revenues associated with the growth of the Broadcast stations subsequent to the prior year.\nparagraph 4: Selling, general and administrative: Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Broadcasting segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $10.9 million to $26.4 million from $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in compensation costs, mainly driven by the cost cutting measures discussed above and lower legal expenses related to elevated acquisition-related expenses incurred in the prior period.\nparagraph 5: Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization from our Broadcasting segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $3.0 million to $6.3 million from $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by additional amortization of fixed assets and definite lived intangible assets which were acquired as part of transactions subsequent to the comparable period.\nparagraph 6: Other operating (income) expense: Other operating (income) expense from our Broadcasting segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $3.3 million to income of $3.0 million from expense of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by reimbursements from the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), partially offset by the impairment of FCC licenses during 2019 resulting from strategic discussions to abandon certain licenses.\nparagraph 7: The FCC requires certain television stations to change channels and/or modify their transmission facilities. The U.S. Congress passed legislation which provides the FCC with a fund to reimburse all reasonable costs incurred by stations operating under full power and Class A licenses and a portion of the costs incurred by stations operating under a low power license that are reassigned to new channels.\n"
