Potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, and the outstanding senior convertible debentures.\nparagraph 4: The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to stockholders:\nparagraph 5: 1 As a result of our net loss attributable to stockholders for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, the inclusion of all potentially dilutive stock options, restricted stock units, and common shares under noted warrants and convertible debt would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, those stock options, restricted stock units and shares were excluded from the computation of the weighted-average shares for diluted net loss per share for such periods.\n"
