        "Performance Shares | Share Units (in Millions) | Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value\n--- | --- | ---\nNonvested performance shares at May 27, 2018 | 1.00 | $33.40\nGranted | 0.45 | $35.96\nAdjustments for performance results attained and dividend equivalents | 0.18 | $31.03\nVested/Issued . | (0.43) | $31.03\nForfeited . | (0.05) | $34.54\nNonvested performance shares at May 26, 2019 | 1.15 | $34.89\n\nparagraph 1: Performance Share Awards\nparagraph 2: In accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we grant performance shares to selected executives and other key employees with vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide performance goals. The performance goal for one-third of the target number of performance shares for the three-year performance period ending in fiscal 2019 (the \"2019 performance period\") is based on our fiscal 2017 EBITDA return on capital, subject to certain adjustments. The fiscal 2017 EBITDA return on capital target, when set, excluded the results of Lamb Weston. The performance goal for the final two-thirds of the target number of performance shares granted for the 2019 performance period is based on our diluted EPS compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\"), subject to certain adjustments, measured over the two-year period ending in fiscal 2019. In addition, for certain participants, all performance shares for the 2019 performance period are subject to an overarching EPS goal that must be met in each fiscal year of the 2019 performance period before any payout on the performance shares can be made to such participants. The awards actually earned for the 2019 performance period will range from zero to two hundred percent of the targeted number of performance shares for that period.\nparagraph 3: The performance goal for each of the three-year performance period ending in fiscal 2020 (the \"2020 performance period\") and the three-year performance period ending in 2021 (\"2021 performance period\") is based on our diluted EPS CAGR, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period. In addition, for certain participants, all performance shares for the 2020 performance period are subject to an overarching EPS goal that must be met in each fiscal year of the 2020 performance period before any payout on the performance shares can be made to such participants. For each of the 2020 performance period and the 2021 performance period, the awards actually earned will range from zero to two hundred percent of the targeted number of performance shares for such performance period.\nparagraph 4: Awards, if earned, will be paid in shares of our common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in our performance share plan, any shares earned will be distributed after the end of the performance period, and only if the participant continues to be employed with the Company through the date of distribution. For awards where performance against the performance target has not been certified, the value of the performance shares is adjusted based upon the market price of our common stock and current forecasted performance against the performance targets at the end of each reporting period and amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nparagraph 5: A summary of the activity for performance share awards as of May 26, 2019 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below:\nparagraph 6: The compensation expense for our performance share awards totaled $8.2 million, $11.8 million, and $13.3 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The tax benefit related to the compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $2.1 million, $3.9 million, and $5.1 million, respectively.\nparagraph 7: The total intrinsic value of performance shares vested (including shares paid in lieu of dividends) during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $15.7 million, $11.2 million, and $2.8 million, respectively.\nparagraph 8: Based on estimates at May 26, 2019, we had $13.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to performance shares that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.\n"
