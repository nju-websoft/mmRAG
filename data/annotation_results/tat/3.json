Operating revenues decreased by 2.0% from NT$151,253 million in 2018 to NT$148,202 million (US$4,955 million) in\n2019, primarily due to decreased other operating revenues, decreased foundry wafer sale, and 2.5% depreciation of the NTD in 2019 from 2018. The decreased foundry wafer sale came from a decline of 2.9% in average selling price from 2018 to 2019, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in foundry wafer shipment from 7,108 thousand 8-inch equivalent wafers in 2018 to 7,189 thousand 8-inch equivalent wafers in 2019.\nparagraph 3: Operating costs. Operating costs decreased by 1.2% from NT$128,413 million in 2018 to NT$126,887 million (US$4,242 million) in 2019, primarily due to the decreased depreciation expense and other operating costs, which was partially offset by the increased direct material costs.\nparagraph 4: Gross profit and gross margin. Gross profit decreased from NT$22,840 million in 2018 to NT$21,315 million (US$713 million) in 2019. Our gross margin decreased from 15.1% in 2018 to 14.4% in 2019, primarily due to an annual decline of 2.9% in average selling price.\n"
