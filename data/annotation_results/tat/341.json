Accrued interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized as part of\nour income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations and is immaterial for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018. Our policy for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income\ntax benefits is to include such items in income tax expense.\nparagraph 3: The activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nparagraph 4: These amounts are related to certain deferred tax assets with a corresponding valuation allowance. As ofDecember 31, 2019, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would affect the effective taxrate is $1.0 million. We do not anticipate a material change to our unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelvemonths. Unrecognized tax benefits may change during the next twelve months for items that arise in the ordinarycourse of business.\nparagraph 5: We are subject to taxation in the United States, various states, and several foreign jurisdictions. Because we havenet operating loss and credit carryforwards, there are open statutes of limitations in which federal, state and foreigntaxing authorities may examine our tax returns for all years from 2005 through the current period. We are notcurrently under examination by any taxing authorities.\n"
