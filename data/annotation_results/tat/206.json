        " |  | Year Ended December 31, | \n--- | --- | --- | ---\n(In thousands) | 2019 | 2018 | 2017\nAsset impairment charges | $ 10,837 | $ 58,166 | $ 0\nGoodwill impairment charge | $ 25,700 | $ 13,466 | $ 0\nImpairment of long-term investments | $ 651 | $ 15,487 | $ 165,290\n\nparagraph 1: 8. Asset Impairment Charges\nparagraph 2: Asset impairment charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily the result of impairing the remaining NantHealth acquired customer relationship intangible balance of $8.1 million. We also recognized non-cash impairment charges of $2.7 million on the retirement of certain hosting assets due to data center migrations.\nparagraph 3: Impairment of long-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of an impairment of $1.7 million associated with one of our long-term equity investments. We also recovered $1.0 million from one of our long-term equity investments investment that we had previously impaired. We also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $25.7 million related to our HHS reporting unit. Refer to Note 7, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for further information regarding this impairment.\nparagraph 4: We incurred several non-cash asset impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2018. We recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $33.2 million related to the write-off of capitalized software as a result of our decision to discontinue several software development projects.\nparagraph 5: We also recorded $22.9 million of non-cash asset impairment charges related to our acquisition of the patient/provider engagement solutions business from NantHealth in 2017, which included the write-downs of $2.2 million of acquired technology and $20.7 million, representing the unamortized value assigned to the modification of our existing commercial agreement with NantHealth, as we no longer expect to recover the value assigned to these assets.\nparagraph 6: The remaining $2.1 million of non-cash asset impairment charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 relate to the disposal of fixed assets as a result of relocating and consolidating business functions and locations from recent acquisitions.\nparagraph 7: We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $13.5 million related to NantHealth during the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 7, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for further information regarding this impairment. We recognized non-cash impairment charges of $15.5 million in 2018 related to two of our cost-method equity investments and a related note receivable. These charges equaled the cost bases of the investments and the related note receivable prior to the impairment.\nparagraph 8: We recorded non-cash charges of $165.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, including impairment charges of $144.6 million associated with two of the Company’s long-term investments based on management’s assessment of the likelihood of near-term recovery of the investments’ value.\nparagraph 9: The majority of the impairment charges related to our investment in NantHealth common stock. We realized an additional $20.7 million loss upon the final disposition of the NantHealth common stock in connection with our acquisition of certain assets related to NantHealth’s provider/patient engagement solutions business. Refer to Note 4, “Business Combinations and Other Investments” and Note 14, “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss,” for further information regarding these impairments.\nparagraph 10: The following table summarizes the non-cash asset impairment charges recorded during the periods indicated and where they appear in the corresponding consolidated statements of operations:\n"
