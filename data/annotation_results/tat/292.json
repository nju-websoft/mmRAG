The Company’s retail reporting unit recorded intangible asset (trademarks and tradenames) impairment charges of approximately $2.9 million during fiscal 2019 and goodwill impairment charges of approximately $1.9 million during fiscal 2018 when it was determined that the carrying values of these assets exceeded their fair values. These impairment charges arose from a range of considerations including, but not limited to, heightened competition in the industry, retail sector market conditions, and earning shortfalls which impacted the Company’s projections of future cash flows to be generated. These impairment charges were recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations as a component of operating income.\nparagraph 3: Goodwill recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet represents amounts allocated to its wholesale reporting unit which totaled $4.4 million at both September 2019 and September 2018. The Company determined that the estimated fair value of its wholesale reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at both September 2019 and September 2018.\n"

However, it does not explicitly state the exact value of 98.78.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The table for 2018 shows that the net carrying value of patents/trademarks is $311, while the total value of all net intangible assets is $3,087. From this information, the percentage of patents/trademarks relative to the total can be calculated as (311 / 3,087) * 100 = 10.08%, but the document does not calculate or directly provide the answer (98.78). Additionally, trademarks and tradenames may not perfectly align with the patents/trademarks category listed in the document.",

It provides useful context and key figures, but the user would need to perform additional calculations and assumptions to arrive at the exact answer."
