Higher revenues coupled with reduced operating expenses drove the year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA. This corresponded to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42.2% in 2019, up 1.6 pts over last year, mainly driven by the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019, and greater service revenue flow-through, moderated by greater low-margin product sales in our total revenue base.\n"
