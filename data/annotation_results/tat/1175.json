This year's result benefited from a foreign exchange gain of $1.5 million, compared to a foreign exchange loss of $6.9 million in the prior-year.\nparagraph 2: The Group’s profit before taxation increased by $94.6 million to $53.6 million, from a loss of $41.0 million in the prior-year, primarily as a consequence of the $80.6 million improvement in operating profit supported by a $13.4 million reduction in finance expenses. Finance expenses benefited from foreign exchange gains in the current year resulting from the strengthening of both sterling and the euro against the US dollar, compared to foreign exchange losses in the prior-year.\nparagraph 3: The Group’s profit for the year increased by $87.8 million to $26.9 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, which given only a small increase in the year-on-year income tax charge was primarily attributable to the improvement in the profit before taxation.\nparagraph 4: Cash flow from operating activities remained strong at $142.9 million, reduced by $4.8 million from $147.7 million in the prior-year. The small overall decrease was due to an increase in overheads, partially offset by a reduction in the cashflow outflow on exceptional items and an improved use of working capital. Unlevered free cashflow decreased by $15.8 million to $123.8 million representing the reduction in net cash flow from operating activities adjusted for the cashflow impact of exceptional items.\nparagraph 5: The table below presents the Group’s financial highlights on a reported basis:\nparagraph 6: 1 Restated for the adoption of IFRS 15 and change in accounting policy in respect of research and development expenditure tax credit scheme and provision for interest on uncertain tax positions, as explained in note 2 of the Financial Statements\nparagraph 7: 2 Definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in note 5 of the Financial Statements\n"
