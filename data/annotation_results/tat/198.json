Operating cash flows increased $64.4 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to favorable changes in working capital of  $37.0 million, primarily due to lower income tax payments of$41.3 million, and higher net income adjusted for non-cash items of $27.3 million\nparagraph 3: Pension and Postretirement Contributions — Our policy is to fund our pension plans at or above the minimum required by law. As of January 1, 2019, the date of our last actuarial funding valuation for our qualified pension plan, there was no minimum contribution funding requirement. In 2019 and 2018, we contributed $6.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively, to our pension and postretirement plans. We do not anticipate making any contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2020. For additional information, refer to Note 12, Retirement Plans, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n"
