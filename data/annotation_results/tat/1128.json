The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the 2022 Notes.\nparagraph 3: Under the capped call transactions, the Company purchased capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the 2022 Notes, with an initial strike price of approximately $33.71 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2022 Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the 2022 Notes, and have a cap price of approximately $47.20.\nparagraph 4: The cost of the purchased capped calls of $12.9 million was recorded to shareholders’ equity and will not be re-measured.\nparagraph 5: Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $78.08 on December 31, 2019, the if-converted value of the 2022 Notes was more than their respective principal amounts.\n"
