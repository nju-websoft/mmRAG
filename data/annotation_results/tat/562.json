The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months from the reporting date. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nparagraph 4: (ii) Fair values of trade and other payables\nparagraph 5: Due to the short-term nature of trade and other payables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair value.\nparagraph 6: (iii) Risk Exposure\nparagraph 7: As the majority of payables are in Australian dollars, management does not believe there are any significant risks in relation to these financial liabilities. Refer to note 15 for details of the Groupâ€™s financial risk management policies.\n"
