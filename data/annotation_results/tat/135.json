Besides the cancellation of 5 million treasury shares in July 2019, the change in the number of treasury shares in 2019 was the result of approximately 951,000 repurchased shares and approximately 498,000 treasury shares that were used as part of share based payments.\nparagraph 4: On December 31, 2019, 48,583,340 of the outstanding common shares were registered with our transfer agent in the Netherlands, ABN AMRO Bank NV; and 282,880 were registered with our transfer agent in the United States, Citibank, NA, New York.\nparagraph 5: On February 25, 2020, ASMI announced that it will propose to the AGM 2020 the cancellation of 1.5 million treasury shares, as the number of 2.4 million treasury shares held at that date was more than sufficient to cover our outstanding options and restricted/performance shares.\n"
