The federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2034. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, the Company had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $445,936.\nparagraph 4: This includes net operating losses previously unrecorded due to minimal projected income in those jurisdictions. These U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years ending from December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2035. Included in the financing and professional fees deferred income assets above are U.S. federal interest expense deductions with an indefinite carryforward period.\nparagraph 5: There was a change of control in the Company during 2014 that limited the annual usage of pre-ownership change net operating losses. All pre-ownership change net operating losses were fully utilized in 2019.\nparagraph 6: The Company assessed all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of existing deferred tax assets. For U.S. federal deferred tax assets, the Company concluded that sufficient positive evidence existed, primarily the result of reversing deferred tax liabilities during the carryover period.\nparagraph 7: However, for certain state deferred tax assets, the negative evidence has outweighed the positive evidence which has resulted in the Company establishing a valuation allowance of $20,952 and $10,961 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized.\nparagraph 8: During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company paid (net of refunds received) $1,293 and $1,313, respectively, of income taxes.\n"
