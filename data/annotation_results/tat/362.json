These were partially offset by the purchase of the remaining minority interest in Pulse8 during 2019.\nparagraph 4: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nparagraph 5: We used cash in financing activities – continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with cash inflows from financing activities – continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily driven by higher repayments of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility and higher common stock repurchases. We used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our investment in Netsmart to repay balances outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities at the end of 2018. We borrowed funds in 2018 to purchase Practice Fusion and Health Grid and to acquire the remaining outstanding minority interest in which we initially acquired a controlling interest in April 2015.\nparagraph 6: Net cash provided by financing activities – discontinued operations increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the prior year primarily due to higher borrowings by Netsmart used to finance business acquisitions.\n"
