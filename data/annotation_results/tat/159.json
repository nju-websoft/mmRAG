The emphasis remained on effective resource allocation and careful cost management. The overall investment in product development was maintained, with continuing focus on high-growth, high-margin areas. Investment in the sales and marketing organisation was targeted on expanding our key account management programme to drive incremental business with our most valuable customers and developing routes to market for our new technologies to a broadening customer base. Administration costs in 2019 reflected an inflationary increase and higher corporate costs, primarily due to CEO transition.\nparagraph 3: Segmentally, investment continued in Networks & Security, where we see the most near-term opportunities for growth, particularly in relation to 400G high-speed Ethernet and our Positioning business. A new General Manager joined Lifecycle Service Assurance in October and a review is in progress to evolve the business and optimise the organisational structure to expand the customer base and deliver on our growth agenda. Proactive cost management has once again been demonstrated within Connected Devices, where we have seen a decrease in legacy product revenue year-on-year. As stated above, corporate costs in 2019 included costs associated with CEO transition.\nparagraph 4: Note\nparagraph 5: 1. Before exceptional items, acquisition related costs, acquired intangible asset amortisation and share-based payment amounting to $4.3 million in total (2018 $19.6 million).\n"
