It also contains information on excluded securities affecting diluted weighted averages, participating securities from equity incentive plans, and temporary equity details from noncontrolling interest related to a specific subsidiary (OpenEye).",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document mentions 'securities' and various stock-related data, which are tangential to the query. However, the term 'average' does not explicitly appear, nor is an explicit calculation of equity securities’ average provided.",

The document provides some relevant information about equity securities (e.g., stock options, restricted stock units, and stock subject to repurchase) but does not include the precise data, formula, or explanation necessary to infer the average.",

Therefore, it is partially relevant because it offers related context but lacks the specificity required to be directly useful in answering the query."
