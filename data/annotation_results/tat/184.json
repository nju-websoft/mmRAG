All $0.3 million of the NOL expires in 2025. We have established a valuation allowance for this\nNOL because the ability to utilize it is not more likely than not.\nparagraph 3: We have tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $5.1 million available to offset future state tax. These tax credit carry-forwards\nexpire in 2020 to 2029. These credits represent a deferred tax asset of $4.0 million after consideration of the federal benefit of state tax\ndeductions. A valuation allowance of $1.8 million has been established for these credits because the ability to use them is not more\nlikely than not.\nparagraph 4: At December 31, 2019 we had approximately $58.2 million of undistributed earnings and profits. The undistributed earnings and\nprofits are considered previously taxed income and would not be subject to U.S. income taxes upon repatriation of those earnings, in\nthe form of dividends. The undistributed earnings and profits are considered to be permanently reinvested, accordingly no provision\nfor local withholdings taxes have been provided, however, upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends, we could be\nsubject to additional local withholding taxes.\n"
