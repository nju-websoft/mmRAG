We made determinations to provide full valuation allowances for our net deferred tax assets at the end of 2019 and 2018, including NOL carryforwards generated during the years, based on our evaluation of positive and negative evidence, including our history of operating losses and the uncertainty of generating future taxable income that would enable us to realize our deferred tax.\n"
