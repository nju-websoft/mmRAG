For the year ended December 31, 2017, the numerator in the diluted net earnings per share calculation is adjusted to reflect our income tax expense at an expected effective tax rate assuming the conversion of the shares of BKFS Class B common stock into shares of BKFS Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the Distribution. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was (16.7)%, including the effect of the benefit related to the revaluation of our net deferred income tax liability and certain other discrete items recorded during 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the denominator includes approximately 63.1 million shares of BKFS Class B common stock outstanding prior to the Distribution. The denominator also includes the dilutive effect of approximately 0.9 million, 0.6 million and 0.6 million shares of unvested restricted shares of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nparagraph 4: The shares of BKFS Class B common stock did not share in the earnings or losses of Black Knight and were, therefore, not participating securities. Accordingly, basic and diluted net earnings per share of BKFS Class B common stock have not been presented.\nparagraph 5: The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\n"
