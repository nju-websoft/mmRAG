The approximate impact of a 10 per cent depreciation in foreign exchange rates would be a negative movement of £40.9 million (2018: £51.9 million) to equity attributable to owners of the Group. There is no material income statement impact as these exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.\nparagraph 4: As part of the strategy to mitigate the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk, the Group is able to borrow part of its RCF in euros, up to €100 million. The RCF borrowings denominated in euros have been designated as a hedging instrument (net investment hedge) against the Group’s net investment in Spain with the hedged risk being the changes in the euro/pounds sterling spot rate that will result in changes in the value of the Group’s net investments in Spain. At 31 December 2019, €100 million (2018: €100 million) was drawn in euros.\n"
