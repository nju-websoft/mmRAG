Operating Leases\nparagraph 2: The Company charters-in vessels from other vessel owners on time-charter-in and bareboat charter contracts, whereby the vessel owner provides use of the vessel to the Company, and, in the case of time-charter-in contracts, also operates the vessel for the Company. A timecharter- in contract is typically for a fixed period of time, although in certain cases the Company may have the option to extend the charter.\nparagraph 3: The Company typically pays the owner a daily hire rate that is fixed over the duration of the charter. The Company is generally not required to pay the daily hire rate for time-charters during periods the vessel is not able to operate.\nparagraph 4: With respect to time-charter- With respect to time-charter-in and bareboat charter contracts with an original term of more than one year, for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred $99.0 million of time-charter and bareboat hire expense related to these time-charter and bareboat charter contracts, of which $68.2 million was allocable to the lease component, and $30.8 million was allocable to the non-lease component.\nparagraph 5: The amounts allocable to the lease component approximate the cash paid for the amounts included in lease liabilities and are reflected as a reduction in operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. Three of Teekay Tankers' time-charter-in contracts each have an option to extend the charter for an additional one-year term.\nparagraph 6: Since it is not reasonably certain that Teekay Tankers will exercise the options, the lease components of the options are not recognized as part of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. As at December 31, 2019, the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for these time-charter-in and bareboat charter contracts were 2.6 years and 6.1%, respectively.\nparagraph 7: During the year ended December 31, 2019, Teekay Tankers chartered in two LR2 vessels and one Aframax vessel for periods of 24 months each, Teekay LNG extended the charter-in contract for one LNG carrier for a period of 21 months, and Teekay Parent extended the charterin contract for one FSO unit for a period of 12 months, which resulted in the Company recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities totaling $47.7 million and $47.7 million, respectively.\nparagraph 8: A maturity analysis of the Companyâ€™s operating lease liabilities from time-charter-in and bareboat charter contracts (excluding short-term leases) at December 31, 2019 is as follows:\nparagraph 9: As at December 31, 2019, minimum commitments to be incurred by the Company under short-term time-charter-in contracts were approximately $4.3 million (2020). As at December 31, 2018, minimum commitments to be incurred by the Company under vessel operating leases by which the Company charters-in vessels were approximately $116.3 million (2019), $90.4 million (2020), $53.4 million (2021), $9.1 million (2022), $9.1 million (2023) and $5.6 million thereafter.\n"
