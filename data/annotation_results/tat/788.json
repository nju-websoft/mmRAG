Information technology and facilities costs and travel and other costs increased primarily as a result of increased headcount.\nparagraph 10: Personnel-related costs increased primarily as a result of salaries and benefits associated with increased headcount and commissions, partially offset by the impact of adopting ASC 606, which resulted in capitalizing $13.8 million of commissions that would have been expensed under the prior accounting rules. Share-based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of share option grants since the prior year. Professional services costs increased primarily due to increased consulting fees.\nparagraph 11: General and administrative expenses\nparagraph 12: General and administrative expenses increased $16.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the year ended March 31, 2018, which was primarily attributable to increases in personnel-related costs of $6.3 million, share-based compensation expense of $5.8 million, information technology and facilities costs of $1.9 million, professional services costs of $1.2 million and litigation-related expenses of $1.0 million. Personnel-related costs increased primarily as a result of salaries and benefits associated with increased headcount.\nparagraph 13: Share-based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of share option grants since the prior year and to a lesser extent the impact of share option modifications. Information technology and facility costs increased primarily as a result of increased headcount. Professional services costs increased primarily due to acquisition-related expenses.\nparagraph 14: Restructuring and Impairment of long-lived assets\nparagraph 15: In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded a revision to restructuring expense of $0.2 million related to the exit of our Watertown, Massachusetts corporate office space. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, upon the exit of our Watertown, Massachusetts corporate office space, we recorded a restructuring charge of $0.8 million for the remaining non-cancelable rent and estimated operating expenses for the vacated premises, net of sublease rentals and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.7 million primarily related to leasehold improvements.\n"

                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document contains 'year' and lists operating expenses suggesting relevance but lacks direct mention of '200,000 thousands' (e.g., $200 million).",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document does not include the year 2018 or figures below $200 million, making it irrelevant to the answer.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The document discusses operating expenses across years, which aligns with the topic. However, it fails to list years post-2016, crucial for confirming the answer.",
                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not contain information for the year 2018 or any year where expenses are less than $200 million.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "No, it cannot help infer the required information beyond 2016 expenses.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "0",
                "Explanation": "While the document lists operating expenses for several years, it does not cover the relevant period required by the query (2018 or later). Therefore, it does not provide directly relevant context or support any inference for the answer."
