The carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximates fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximates current market rates.\nparagraph 3: Notes payable and long-term debt is carried at amortized cost; however, the Company estimates the fair value of notes payable and long-term debt for disclosure purposes. The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s notes payable and long-term debt, by hierarchy level as of the periods indicated:\nparagraph 4: (1) The fair value estimates are based upon observable market data.\nparagraph 5: (2) This fair value estimate is based on the Company’s indicative borrowing cost derived from discounted cash flows.\nparagraph 6: Refer to Note 9 – “Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits” for disclosure surrounding the fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets.\n"
