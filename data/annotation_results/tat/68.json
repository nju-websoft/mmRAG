The payment was allocated between total estimated merger consideration of $11.1 million and post-merger stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, based on the portion of the total service period of the underlying options that have not been completed by the merger date.\nparagraph 4: During fiscal 2019, $4.8 million of stock-based compensation cost was capitalized as part of inventory for all stock plans, $4.8 million was amortized into cost of sales and $1.5 million remained in inventory at September 28, 2019. During fiscal 2018, $4.7 million of stock-based compensation cost was capitalized as part of inventory for all stock plans, $4.4 million was amortized into cost of sales and $1.5 million remained in inventory at September 29, 2018.\nparagraph 5: At fiscal 2019 year-end, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards granted to employees under our stock plans but not yet recognized was approximately $33.1 million. We do not estimate forfeitures. This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.\n"
