These awards generally have requisite service periods of three years. Under each such award, stock or cash (as applicable) is issued without direct cost to the employee. We estimate the fair value of the share units based upon the market price of our stock at the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite service period (the \"vesting period\"). For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent payments.\nparagraph 3: We recognize compensation expense for share unit awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, accounting for forfeitures as they occur. All cash-settled restricted stock units are marked-to-market and presented within other current and noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The compensation expense for our stock-settled share unit awards totaled $23.9 million, $21.8 million, and $18.2 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, including discontinued operations of $1.4 million for fiscal 2017. The tax benefit related to the stock-settled share unit award compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $6.0 million, $7.2 million, and $7.0 million, respectively. The compensation expense for our cash-settled share unit awards totaled $17.5 million, $5.8 million, and $20.9 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, including discontinued operations of $2.6 million for fiscal 2017. The tax benefit related to the cash-settled share unit award compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $4.4 million, $1.9 million, and $8.0 million, respectively.\nparagraph 4: During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, in connection with the completion of the Pinnacle acquisition, we granted 2.0 million cash-settled share unit awards at a grant date fair value of $36.37 per share unit to Pinnacle employees in replacement of their unvested restricted share unit awards that were outstanding as of the closing date. Included in the compensation expense described above for fiscal 2019 is expense of $18.9 million for accelerated vesting of awards related to Pinnacle integration restructuring activities, net of the impact of marking-to-market these awards based on a lower market price of shares of Conagra Brands common stock. Approximately $36.3 million of the fair value of the replacement share unit awards granted to Pinnacle employees was attributable to pre-combination service and was included in the purchase price and established as a liability. Included in the expense for cash-settled share unit awards above is income of $6.7 million related to the mark-to-market of this liability. As of May 26, 2019, our liability for the replacement awards was $15.9 million, which includes post-combination service expense, the mark-to-market of the liability, and the impact of payouts since completing the Pinnacle acquisition. Post-combination expense of approximately $3.9 million, based on the market price of shares of Conagra Brands common stock as of May 26, 2019, is expected to be recognized related to the replacement awards over the remaining post-combination service period of approximately two years.\nparagraph 5: The following table summarizes the nonvested share units as of May 26, 2019 and changes during the fiscal year then ended:\nparagraph 6: During fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we granted 0.9 million, 0.9 million, and 0.6 million stock-settled share units, respectively, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $35.43, $34.16, and $46.79 per share unit, respectively. During fiscal 2017, we granted 0.4 million cash-settled share units with a weighted average grant date fair value of $48.07 per share unit. No cash-settled share unit awards were granted in fiscal 2018.\nparagraph 7: The total intrinsic value of stock-settled share units vested was $24.6 million, $18.5 million, and $27.0 million during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The total intrinsic value of cash-settled share units vested was $50.5 million, $14.2 million, and $24.0 million during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nparagraph 8: At May 26, 2019, we had $25.2 million and $4.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years and 1.5 years, related to stock-settled share unit awards and cash-settled share unit awards, respectively\nparagraph 9: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2019, May 27, 2018, and May 28, 2017 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n"
