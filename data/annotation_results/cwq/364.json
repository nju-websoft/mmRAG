While it doesn't mention George Soros, the extensive list of people associated with Judaism and the clear connection between Sefer Yetzirah and Judaism provide substantial useful context for understanding and partially answering the query. This makes the document directly related to the conversation and enhances understanding of the main topic, justifying a relevance judgement of 2."
