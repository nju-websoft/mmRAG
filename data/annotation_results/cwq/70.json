                "Document Content Analysis": "The document provides information about the national anthem of Vietnam, stating that it is 'Tiến Quân Ca' and has been the official anthem since August 1976. It also mentions that 'Tiến Quân Ca' is the national anthem of Vietnam.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document matches the query keywords 'national anthem' and 'Tien Quan Ca' (which is spelled as 'Tiến Quân Ca' in the document).",

While it does not explicitly state the type of government, this information is crucial for inferring the correct answer. Given that Vietnam is widely recognized as a Communist state, the document provides substantial useful context to answer the query."
