                "Document Content Analysis": "The document discusses events and actions during the Cuban Missile Crisis, including communication between Kennedy and Khrushchev, the US Navy blockade efforts, and the movement of American and Soviet ships. The event is explicitly linked to 'Cuba,' as it discusses the crisis' geographic and political context.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document explicitly mentions 'Cuba,' which matches the part of the query related to the Cuban Missile Crisis. There is no mention of 'Theodore Roosevelt' or his appointment in the document.",

                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the query, as it only addresses one part of the query (Cuban Missile Crisis in Cuba) and has no information about Theodore Roosevelt.",

However, it does not address the other component of the query related to Theodore Roosevelt, making it insufficient to fully answer the query. Therefore, it is judged as partially relevant (Label 1)."
