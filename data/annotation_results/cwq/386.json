                "Explanation": "The document is partially relevant as it provides detailed information about the Islamic belief in God (Allah) and emphasizes monotheism, which is crucial for understanding the query. However, it does not mention 'Ramdev Pir', making it unable to fully answer the query. The document helps infer that Islam does not typically recognize multiple gods, which is useful context."
