In a much smaller project, [Federal Project Number\nOne](/wiki/Federal_Project_Number_One \"Federal Project Number One\"), the WPA\nemployed musicians, artists, writers, actors and directors in large arts,\ndrama, media, and literacy projects.[1]\n\nAlmost every community in the United States had a new park, bridge or school\nconstructed by the agency. The WPA's initial appropriation in 1935 was for\n$4.9 billion (about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP).[2]\n\nHeaded by [Harry Hopkins](/wiki/Harry_Hopkins \"Harry Hopkins\"), the WPA\nprovided jobs and income to the unemployed during the [Great Depression in the\nUnited States](/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States \"Great Depression\nin the United States\"). At its peak in 1938, it provided paid jobs for three\nmillion unemployed men and women, as well as youth in a separate division, the\n[National Youth Administration](/wiki/National_Youth_Administration \"National\nYouth Administration\"). Between 1935 and 1943, when the agency was disbanded,\nthe WPA employed 8.5 million people.[3] Most people who needed a job were\neligible for employment in some capacity.[4] Hourly wages were typically set\nto the prevailing wages in each area.[5]:70 Full employment, which was reached\nin 1942 and emerged as a long-term national goal around 1944, was not the goal\nof the WPA; rather, it tried to provide one paid job for all families in which\nthe [breadwinner](/wiki/Breadwinner_model \"Breadwinner model\") suffered long-\nterm unemployment.[6]:64, 184\n\n\"The stated goal of public building programs was to end the depression or, at\nleast, alleviate its worst effects,\" sociologist Robert D. Leighninger\nasserted. \"Millions of people needed subsistence incomes. Work relief was\npreferred over public assistance (the dole) because it maintained self-\nrespect, reinforced the work ethic, and kept skills sharp.\"[7]:228\n\nThe WPA was a national program that operated its own projects in cooperation\nwith state and local governments, which provided 10–30% of the costs. Usually\nthe local sponsor provided land and often trucks and supplies, with the WPA\nresponsible for wages (and for the salaries of supervisors, who were not on\nrelief). WPA sometimes took over state and local relief programs that had\noriginated in the [Reconstruction Finance\nCorporation](/wiki/Reconstruction_Finance_Corporation \"Reconstruction Finance\nCorporation\") (RFC) or [Federal Emergency Relief\nAdministration](/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Relief_Administration \"Federal\nEmergency Relief Administration\") programs.[6]:63\n\nIt was liquidated on June 30, 1943, as a result of low unemployment due to the\nworker shortage of [World War\nII](/wiki/United_States_home_front_during_World_War_II \"United States home\nfront during World War II\"). The WPA had provided millions of Americans with\njobs for eight years.[6]:71\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Establishment\n  * 2 Employment\n  * 3 Projects\n    * 3.1 Federal Project Number One\n      * 3.1.1 Federal Art Project\n      * 3.1.2 Federal Music Project\n      * 3.1.3 Federal Theatre Project\n      * 3.1.4 Federal Writers' Project\n      * 3.1.5 Historical Records Survey\n  * 4 Relief for African Americans\n  * 5 Women\n  * 6 Criticism\n  * 7 Evolution\n  * 8 Termination\n  * 9 Legacy\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 Further reading\n  * 13 External links\n\n##\nEstablishment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Works_Progress_Administration&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Establishment\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/FDR-\nApril-28-1935-side.jpg/220px-FDR-April-28-1935-side.jpg)](/wiki/File:FDR-\nApril-28-1935-side.jpg)\n\nFDR prepares to speak about the establishment of the work relief program and\n[Social Security](/wiki/Social_Security_Act \"Social Security Act\") at his\n[fireside chat](/wiki/Fireside_chats \"Fireside chats\") of [April 28,\n1935](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Roosevelt%27s_Fireside_Chat,_28_April_1935\n\"s:Roosevelt's Fireside Chat, 28 April 1935\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Harry-Hopkins-WPA-\nNovember-1935.jpg/220px-Harry-Hopkins-WPA-\nNovember-1935.jpg)](/wiki/File:Harry-Hopkins-WPA-November-1935.jpg)\n\n[FERA](/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Relief_Administration \"Federal Emergency Relief\nAdministration\") administrator and WPA head [Harry\nHopkins](/wiki/Harry_Hopkins \"Harry Hopkins\") speaking to reporters (November\n1935)\n\nA [joint resolution](/wiki/Joint_resolution \"Joint resolution\") introduced\nJanuary 21, 1935,[8] the [Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of\n1935](/wiki/Emergency_Relief_Appropriation_Act_of_1935 \"Emergency Relief\nAppropriation Act of 1935\") was passed by the [United States\nCongress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") and signed\ninto law by President [Franklin D.

Direct relief\nassistance was permanently replaced by a national work relief program—a major\n[public works](/wiki/Public_works \"Public works\") program directed by the\nWPA.[12]\n\nThe WPA was largely shaped by [Harry Hopkins](/wiki/Harry_Hopkins \"Harry\nHopkins\"), supervisor of the [Federal Emergency Relief\nAdministration](/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Relief_Administration \"Federal\nEmergency Relief Administration\") and close adviser to Roosevelt. Both\nRoosevelt and Hopkins believed that the route to economic recovery and the\nlessened importance of the dole would be in employment programs such as the\nWPA.[6]:56–57 [Hallie Flanagan](/wiki/Hallie_Flanagan \"Hallie Flanagan\"),\nnational director of the [Federal Theatre\nProject](/wiki/Federal_Theatre_Project \"Federal Theatre Project\"), wrote that\n\"for the first time in the relief experiments of this country the preservation\nof the skill of the worker, and hence the preservation of his self-respect,\nbecame important.\"[13]:17\n\nThe WPA was organized into the following divisions:\n\n  * The Division of Engineering and Construction, which planned and supervised construction projects including airports, dams, highways and sanitation systems.[14]\n  * The Division of Professional and Service Projects (called the Division of Women's and Professional Projects in 1937), which was responsible for [white-collar](/wiki/White-collar_worker \"White-collar worker\") projects including education programs, recreation programs, and the arts projects.

All its people.\n>\n> — Nick Taylor, _American-Made: The Enduring Legacy of the WPA_[22]:530\n\nThe goal of the WPA was to employ most of the unemployed people on relief\nuntil the economy recovered. [Harry Hopkins](/wiki/Harry_Hopkins \"Harry\nHopkins\") testified to Congress in January 1935 why he set the number at 3.5\nmillion, using [Federal Emergency Relief\nAdministration](/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Relief_Administration \"Federal\nEmergency Relief Administration\") data. Estimating costs at $1,200 per worker\nper year ($21 thousand in present-day terms[23]), he asked for and received $4\nbillion ($69.9 billion in present-day terms[23]). Many women were employed,\nbut they were few compared to men.\n\nIn 1935 there were 20 million people on relief in the United States. Of these,\n8.3 million were children under 16 years of age; 3.8 million were persons\nbetween the ages of 16 and 65 who were not working or seeking work. These\nincluded housewives, students in school, and incapacitated persons. Another\n750,000 were person age 65 or over.[24]:562 Thus, of the total of 20 million\npersons then receiving relief, 13 million were not considered eligible for\nemployment. This left a total of 7 million presumably employable persons\nbetween the ages of 16 and 65 inclusive. Of these, however, 1.65 million were\nsaid to be farm operators or persons who had some non-relief employment, while\nanother 350,000 were, despite the fact that they were already employed or\nseeking work, considered incapacitated. Deducting this 2 million from the\ntotal of 7.15 million, there remained 5.15 million persons age 16 to 65,\nunemployed, looking for work, and able to work.[24]:562\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/FDR-Hopkins-\nSeptember-1938.jpg/220px-FDR-Hopkins-September-1938.jpg)](/wiki/File:FDR-\nHopkins-September-1938.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:FDR-Hopkins-September-1938.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFDR and Hopkins (September 1938)\n\nBecause of the assumption that only one worker per family would be permitted\nto work under the proposed program, this total of 5.15 million was further\nreduced by 1.6 million—the estimated number of workers who were members of\nfamilies with two or more employable people. Thus, there remained a net total\nof 3.55 million workers in as many households for whom jobs were to be\nprovided.[24]:562\n\nThe WPA reached its peak employment of 3,334,594 people in November\n1938.[22]:547 To be eligible for WPA employment, an individual had to be an\nAmerican citizen, 18 or older, able-bodied, unemployed, and certified as in\nneed by a local public relief agency approved by the WPA. The WPA Division of\nEmployment selected the worker's placement to WPA projects based on previous\nexperience or training. Worker pay was based on three factors: the region of\nthe country, the degree of urbanization, and the individual's\n[skill](/wiki/Skill_\\(labor\\) \"Skill \\(labor\\)\"). It varied from $19 per month\nto $94 per month, with the average wage being about $52.50—$893.00 in present-\nday terms.[23][25] The goal was to pay the local prevailing wage, but limit\nthe hours of work to 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week; the stated minimum\nbeing 30 hours a week, or 120 hours a month.[24]:213\n\n##\nProjects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Works_Progress_Administration&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Projects\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/WPAsign.JPG/220px-\nWPAsign.JPG)](/wiki/File:WPAsign.JPG)\n\nTypical plaque on a WPA project\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Griffith_Observatory_on_the_south-\nfacing_slope_of_Mount_Hollywood_in_L.A.%27s_Griffith_Park_%28LC-DIG-\nhighsm-_22255%29.tif/lossy-page1-220px-Griffith_Observatory_on_the_south-\nfacing_slope_of_Mount_Hollywood_in_L.A.%27s_Griffith_Park_%28LC-DIG-\nhighsm-_22255%29.tif.jpg)](/wiki/File:Griffith_Observatory_on_the_south-\nfacing_slope_of_Mount_Hollywood_in_L.A.%27s_Griffith_Park_\\(LC-DIG-\nhighsm-_22255\\).tif)\n\n[Griffith Observatory](/wiki/Griffith_Observatory \"Griffith Observatory\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Timberline_Lodge_2014.jpg/220px-\nTimberline_Lodge_2014.jpg)](/wiki/File:Timberline_Lodge_2014.jpg)\n\n[Timberline Lodge](/wiki/Timberline_Lodge \"Timberline Lodge\")\n\nWPA projects were administered by the Division of Engineering and Construction\nand the Division of Professional and Service Projects. Most projects were\ninitiated, planned and sponsored by states, counties or cities. Nationwide\nprojects were sponsored until 1939.[26]\n\nThe WPA built traditional infrastructure of the [New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New\nDeal\") such as roads, bridges, schools, courthouses, hospitals, sidewalks,\nwaterworks, and post-offices, but also constructed museums, swimming pools,\nparks, community centers, playgrounds, coliseums, markets, fairgrounds, tennis\ncourts, zoos, botanical gardens, auditoriums, waterfronts, city halls, gyms,\nand university unions. Most of these are still in use today.[7]:226 The amount\nof infrastructure projects of the WPA included 40,000 new and 85,000 improved\nbuildings. These new buildings included 5,900 new schools; 9,300 new\nauditoriums, gyms, and recreational buildings; 1,000 new libraries; 7,000 new\ndormitories; and 900 new armories. In addition, infrastructure projects\nincluded 2,302 stadiums, grandstands, and bleachers; 52 fairgrounds and rodeo\ngrounds; 1,686 parks covering 75,152 acres; 3,185 playgrounds; 3,026 athletic\nfields; 805 swimming pools; 1,817 handball courts; 10,070 tennis courts; 2,261\nhorseshoe pits; 1,101 ice-skating areas; 138 outdoor theatres; 254 golf\ncourses; and 65 ski jumps.[7]:227 Total expenditures on WPA projects through\nJune 1941 totaled approximately $11.4 billion—the equivalent of $186 billion\ntoday.[23] Over $4 billion was spent on highway, road, and street projects;\nmore than $1 billion on public buildings, including the iconic [Dock Street\nTheatre](/wiki/Dock_Street_Theatre \"Dock Street Theatre\") in Charleston, the\n[Griffith Observatory](/wiki/Griffith_Observatory \"Griffith Observatory\") in\nLos Angeles, and [Timberline Lodge](/wiki/Timberline_Lodge \"Timberline Lodge\")\nin Oregon's [Mount Hood National Forest](/wiki/Mount_Hood_National_Forest\n\"Mount Hood National Forest\").[27]:252–253\n\nMore than $1 billion—$16.3 billion today[23]—was spent on publicly owned or\noperated utilities; and another $1 billion on welfare projects, including\nsewing projects for women, the distribution of surplus commodities, and school\nlunch projects.[24]:129 One construction project was the [Merritt\nParkway](/wiki/Merritt_Parkway \"Merritt Parkway\") in Connecticut, the bridges\nof which were each designed as architecturally unique.[28] In its eight-year\nrun, the WPA built 325 firehouses and renovated 2,384 of them across the\nUnited States. The 20,000 miles of water mains, installed by their hand as\nwell, contributed to increased fire protection across the country.[6]:69\n\nThe direct focus of the WPA projects changed with need. In 1935 priority\nprojects were to improve infrastructure; roads, extension of electricity to\nrural areas, water conservation, sanitation and flood control. In 1936, as\noutlined in that year’s [Emergency Relief Appropriations\nAct](/wiki/Emergency_Relief_Appropriations_Act \"Emergency Relief\nAppropriations Act\"), public facilities became a focus; parks and associated\nfacilities, public buildings, utilities, airports, and transportation projects\nwere funded. The following year, saw the introduction of agricultural\nimprovements, such as the production of marl fertilizer and the eradication of\nfungus pests. As the Second World War approached, and then eventually began,\nWPA projects became increasingly defense related.[6]:70\n\nOne project of the WPA was funding state-level library service demonstration\nprojects, to create new areas of library service to underserved populations\nand to extend rural service.[29] Another project was the [Household Service\nDemonstration Project](/wiki/Household_Service_Demonstration_Project\n\"Household Service Demonstration Project\"), which trained 30,000 women for\ndomestic employment. [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\")\nhad one of the larger statewide library service demonstration projects. At the\nend of the project in 1943, South Carolina had twelve publicly funded county\nlibraries, one regional library, and a funded state library agency.[30]\n\n### Federal Project Number\nOne[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Works_Progress_Administration&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Federal Project Number One\")]\n\nA significant aspect of the Works Progress Administration was the [Federal\nProject Number One](/wiki/Federal_Project_Number_One \"Federal Project Number\nOne\"), which had five different parts: the [Federal Art\nProject](/wiki/Federal_Art_Project \"Federal Art Project\"), the [Federal Music\nProject](/wiki/Federal_Music_Project \"Federal Music Project\"), the [Federal\nTheatre Project](/wiki/Federal_Theatre_Project \"Federal Theatre Project\"), the\n[Federal Writers Project](/wiki/Federal_Writers_Project \"Federal Writers\nProject\"), and the [Historical Records Survey](/wiki/Historical_Records_Survey\n\"Historical Records Survey\"). The government wanted to provide new federal\ncultural support instead of just providing direct grants to private\ninstitutions. After only one year, over 40,000 artists and other talented\nworkers had been employed through this project in the United States.[31]\nCedric Larson stated that \"The impact made by the five major cultural projects\nof the WPA upon the national consciousness is probably greater in toto than\nanyone readily realizes. As channels of communication between the\nadministration and the country at large, both directly and indirectly, the\nimportance of these projects cannot be overestimated, for they all carry a\ntremendous appeal to the eye, the ear, or the intellect—or all three.\"[32]:491\n\n#### Federal Art\nProject[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Works_Progress_Administration&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Federal Art Project\")]\n\nMain article: [Federal Art Project](/wiki/Federal_Art_Project \"Federal Art\nProject\")\n\nThis project was directed by [Holger Cahill](/wiki/Holger_Cahill \"Holger\nCahill\") and in 1936, the peak for employment in this federal project, the\nFederal Art Project employed over 5,300 artists. The Arts Service Division\ncreated illustrations and posters for the WPA writers, musicians, and\ntheaters. The Exhibition Division had public exhibitions of artwork from the\nWPA, and artists from the Art Teaching Division were employed in settlement\nhouses and community centers to give classes to an estimated 50,000 children\nand adults. They set up over 100 art centers around the country that served an\nestimated eight million individuals.[31]\n\n#### Federal Music\nProject[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Works_Progress_Administration&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Federal Music Project\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/WPABandLafayetteSquareNOLA.jpg/220px-\nWPABandLafayetteSquareNOLA.jpg)](/wiki/File:WPABandLafayetteSquareNOLA.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:WPABandLafayetteSquareNOLA.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNoon-hour WPA band concert in [Lafayette\nSquare](/wiki/Lafayette_Square_\\(New_Orleans\\) \"Lafayette Square \\(New\nOrleans\\)\"), [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\") (1940)\n\nMain article: [Federal Music Project](/wiki/Federal_Music_Project \"Federal\nMusic Project\")\n\nDirected by [Nikolai Sokoloff](/wiki/Nikolai_Sokoloff \"Nikolai Sokoloff\"),\nformer principal conductor of the [Cleveland\nOrchestra](/wiki/Cleveland_Orchestra \"Cleveland Orchestra\"), the [Federal\nMusic Project](/wiki/Federal_Music_Project \"Federal Music Project\") employed\nover 16,000 musicians at its peak. Its purpose was to establish different\nensembles such as chamber groups, orchestras, choral units, opera units,\nconcert bands, military bands, dance bands, and theater orchestras that gave\nan estimated 131,000 performances and programs to 92 million people each\nweek.[31] The Federal Music Project performed plays and dances, as well as\nradio dramas.[32]:494 In addition, the Federal Music Project gave music\nclasses to an estimated 132,000 children and adults every week, recorded folk\nmusic, served as copyists, arrangers, and librarians to expand the\navailability of music, and experimented in music therapy.[31] Sokoloff stated,\n\"Music can serve no useful purpose unless it is heard, but these totals on the\nlisteners' side are more eloquent than statistics as they show that in this\ncountry there is a great hunger and eagerness for music.\"[32]:494\n\n#### Federal Theatre\nProject[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Works_Progress_Administration&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Federal Theatre Project\")]\n\nMain article: [Federal Theatre Project](/wiki/Federal_Theatre_Project \"Federal\nTheatre Project\")\n\nThis project was directed by Iowan [Hallie Flanagan](/wiki/Hallie_Flanagan\n\"Hallie Flanagan\"), and employed 12,700 performers at its peak. These\nperformers presented more than 1,000 performances each month to almost one\nmillion people, produced 1,200 plays in the four years it was established, and\nintroduced 100 new playwrights. Many performers later became successful in\n[Hollywood](/wiki/Hollywood \"Hollywood\") including [Orson\nWelles](/wiki/Orson_Welles \"Orson Welles\"), [John\nHouseman](/wiki/John_Houseman \"John Houseman\"), [Burt\nLancaster](/wiki/Burt_Lancaster \"Burt Lancaster\"), [Joseph\nCotten](/wiki/Joseph_Cotten \"Joseph Cotten\"), [Canada Lee](/wiki/Canada_Lee\n\"Canada Lee\"), [Will Geer](/wiki/Will_Geer \"Will Geer\"), [Joseph\nLosey](/wiki/Joseph_Losey \"Joseph Losey\"), [Virgil\nThompson](/wiki/Virgil_Thompson \"Virgil Thompson\"), [Nicholas\nRay](/wiki/Nicholas_Ray \"Nicholas Ray\"), [E.G.

The FERA's first relief\ncensus reported that more than two million African Americans were on relief\nduring early 1933, a proportion of the African-American population (17.8%)\nthat was nearly double the proportion of whites on relief (9.5%).[33] This was\nduring the period of [Jim Crow](/wiki/Jim_Crow \"Jim Crow\") and [racial\nsegregation](/wiki/Racial_segregation \"Racial segregation\") in the South, when\nblacks were largely\n[disenfranchised](/wiki/Disfranchisement_after_Reconstruction_era\n\"Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era\").\n\nBy 1935, there were 3,500,000 African Americans (men, women and children) on\nrelief, almost 35 percent of the African-American population; plus another\n250,000 African-American adults were working on WPA projects. Altogether\nduring 1938, about 45 percent of the nation's African-American families were\neither on relief or were employed by the WPA.[33]\n\n[Civil rights](/wiki/Civil_rights \"Civil rights\") leaders initially objected\nthat African Americans were proportionally underrepresented. African American\nleaders made such a claim with respect to WPA hires in New Jersey, stating,\n\"In spite of the fact that Blacks indubitably constitute more than 20 percent\nof the State's unemployed, they composed 15.9% of those assigned to W.P.A.\njobs during 1937.\"[24]:287 Nationwide in 1940, 9.8% of the population were\nAfrican American.\n\nHowever, by 1941, the perception of discrimination against African Americans\nhad changed to the point that the [NAACP](/wiki/NAACP \"NAACP\") magazine\n_Opportunity_ hailed the WPA:\n\n> It is to the eternal credit of the administrative officers of the WPA that\n> discrimination on various projects because of race has been kept to a\n> minimum and that in almost every community Negroes have been given a chance\n> to participate in the work program.

The average worker was about 40 years old (about the same as\nthe average family head on relief).\n\nWPA policies were consistent with the strong belief of the time that husbands\nand wives should not both be working (because the second person working would\ntake one job away from some other breadwinner). A study of 2,000 female\nworkers in Philadelphia showed that 90% were married, but wives were reported\nas living with their husbands in only 18 percent of the cases. Only 2 percent\nof the husbands had private employment. Of the 2,000 women, all were\nresponsible for one to five additional people in the household.[24]:283\n\nIn rural Missouri, 60% of the WPA-employed women were without husbands (12%\nwere single; 25% widowed; and 23% divorced, separated or deserted). Thus, only\n40% were married and living with their husbands, but 59% of the husbands were\npermanently disabled, 17% were temporarily disabled, 13% were too old to work,\nand remaining 10% were either unemployed or handicapped. Most of the women\nworked with sewing projects, where they were taught to use sewing machines and\nmade clothing and bedding, as well as supplies for hospitals, orphanages, and\nadoption centers.[24]:283[37]\n\nOne WPA-funded project, the [Pack Horse Library\nProject](/wiki/Pack_Horse_Library_Project \"Pack Horse Library Project\"),\nmainly employed women to deliver books to rural areas in eastern\n[Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky \"Kentucky\").[38] Many of the women employed by the\nproject were the sole breadwinners for their families.[39]\n\n##\nCriticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Works_Progress_Administration&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Criticism\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/WPA-Rumor-\nPoster.jpg/220px-WPA-Rumor-Poster.jpg)](/wiki/File:WPA-Rumor-Poster.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:WPA-Rumor-Poster.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPoster representing the WPA defending itself from attacks\n\nThe WPA had numerous critics, especially from conservatives. The strongest\nattacks were that it was the prelude for a national political machine on\nbehalf of Roosevelt. Reformers secured the [Hatch Act of\n1939](/wiki/Hatch_Act_of_1939 \"Hatch Act of 1939\") that largely depoliticized\nthe WPA.[40]\n\nOthers complained that far left elements played a major role, especially in\nthe New York City unit. Representative [J. Parnell\nThomas](/wiki/J._Parnell_Thomas \"J. Parnell Thomas\") of the [House Committee\non Un-American Activities](/wiki/House_Committee_on_Un-American_Activities\n\"House Committee on Un-American Activities\") claimed in 1938 that divisions of\nthe WPA were a \"hotbed of Communists\" and \"one more link in the vast and\nunparalleled New Deal propaganda network.\"[41]\n\nMuch of the criticism of the distribution of projects and funding allotment is\na result of the view that the decisions were politically motivated. The South,\nas the poorest region of the United States, received 75 percent less in\nfederal relief and public works funds per capita than the West. Critics would\npoint to the fact that Roosevelt’s Democrats could be sure of voting support\nfrom the South, whereas the West was less of a sure thing; [swing\nstates](/wiki/Swing_state \"Swing state\") took priority over the other\nstates.[5]:70\n\nThere was a perception that WPA employees were not diligent workers, and that\nthey had little incentive to give up their [busy work](/wiki/Busy_work \"Busy\nwork\") in favor of productive jobs. Some employers said that the WPA instilled\npoor work habits and encouraged inefficiency.[42] Some job applicants found\nthat a WPA work history was viewed negatively by employers, who said they had\nformed poor work habits.[43]\n\nA Senate committee reported that, \"To some extent the complaint that WPA\nworkers do poor work is not without foundation. … Poor work habits and\nincorrect techniques are not remedied. Occasionally a supervisor or a foreman\ndemands good work.\"[44] The WPA and its workers were ridiculed as being lazy.\nThe organization's initials were said to stand for \"We Poke Along\" or \"We\nPutter Along\" or \"We piddle around\" or \"Whistle, Piss and Argue.\" These were\nsarcastic references to WPA projects that sometimes slowed down deliberately\nbecause foremen had an incentive to keep going, rather than finish a\nproject.[45]\n\nThe WPA's Division of Investigation proved so effective in preventing\npolitical corruption \"that a later congressional investigation couldn't find a\nsingle serious irregularity it had overlooked,\" wrote economist [Paul\nKrugman](/wiki/Paul_Krugman \"Paul Krugman\"). \"This dedication to honest\ngovernment wasn't a sign of Roosevelt's personal virtue; rather, it reflected\na political imperative.

Created at the\nsame time, the [Federal Security Agency](/wiki/Federal_Security_Agency\n\"Federal Security Agency\") assumed the WPA's responsibility for the [National\nYouth Administration](/wiki/National_Youth_Administration \"National Youth\nAdministration\"). \"The name of the Works Progress Administration has been\nchanged to Work Projects Administration in order to make its title more\ndescriptive of its major purpose,\" President Roosevelt wrote when announcing\nthe reorganization.[47]\n\nAs WPA projects became more subject to the state, local sponsors were called\non to provide 25% of project costs. As the number of public works projects\nslowly diminished, more projects were dedicated to preparing for war.[7]:227\nHaving languished since the end of World War I, the American military services\nwere depopulated and served by crumbling facilities; when [Germany occupied\nCzechoslovakia](/wiki/German_occupation_of_Czechoslovakia \"German occupation\nof Czechoslovakia\") in 1938, the U.S. Army numbered only 176,000\nsoldiers.[22]:494\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/WPAMapMakersGoToWarNewOrleans1941.jpg/220px-\nWPAMapMakersGoToWarNewOrleans1941.jpg)](/wiki/File:WPAMapMakersGoToWarNewOrleans1941.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:WPAMapMakersGoToWarNewOrleans1941.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWPA researchers and map makers prepare the air raid warning map for New\nOrleans within days of the [attack on Pearl\nHarbor](/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor \"Attack on Pearl Harbor\") (December 11,\n1941)\n\nOn May 26, 1940, FDR delivered a [fireside chat](/wiki/Fireside_chats\n\"Fireside chats\") to the American people about \"the approaching storm\",[48]\nand on June 6 Harrington reprioritized WPA projects, anticipating a major\nexpansion of the U.S. military. \"Types of WPA work to be expedited in every\npossible way to include, in addition to airports and [military\nairfields](/wiki/Military_air_base \"Military air base\"), construction of\nhousing and other facilities for enlarged military garrisons, camp and\ncantonment construction, and various improvements in navy yards,\" Harrington\nsaid. He observed that the WPA had already made substantial contributions to\nnational defense over its five years of existence, by building 85 percent of\nthe new airports in the U.S. and making $420 million in improvements to\nmilitary facilities. He predicted there would be 500,000 WPA workers on\ndefense-related projects over the next 12 months, at a cost of $250\nmillion.[22]:492–493 The estimated number of WPA workers needed for defense\nprojects was soon revised to between 600,000 and 700,000. Vocational training\nfor war industries was also begun by the WPA, with 50,000 trainees in the\nprogram by October 1940.[22]:494\n\n\"Only the WPA, having employed millions of relief workers for more than five\nyears, had a comprehensive awareness of the skills that would be available in\na full-scale national emergency,\" wrote journalist Nick Taylor. \"As the\ncountry began its preparedness buildup, the WPA was uniquely positioned to\nbecome a major defense agency.\"[22]:494–495\n\nHarrington died suddenly, aged 53, on September 30, 1940. Notably\napolitical—he boasted that he had never voted[49]—he had deflected\nCongressional criticism of the WPA by bringing attention to its building\naccomplishments and its role as an employer.[22]:504 Harrington's successor,\nHoward O.

Experience had amply justified this\npolicy,\" FDR wrote:\n\n> By building airports, schools, highways, and parks; by making huge\n> quantities of clothing for the unfortunate; by serving millions of lunches\n> to school children; by almost immeasurable kinds and quantities of service\n> the Work Projects Administration has reached a creative hand into every\n> county in this Nation.
