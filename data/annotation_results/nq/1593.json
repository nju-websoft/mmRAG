In the 1960s and 1970s he worked\nfor both the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he was\nan associate artist. On TV he played \"Dask\" in the 1977 _[Doctor\nWho](/wiki/Doctor_Who \"Doctor Who\")_ serial _[The Robots of\nDeath](/wiki/The_Robots_of_Death \"The Robots of Death\")_ , and also appeared\nin _[Blake's 7](/wiki/Blake%27s_7 \"Blake's 7\")_. On film, he played the mute\npirate\n[Cotton](/wiki/List_of_minor_characters_in_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean#Cotton_and_his_Parrot\n\"List of minor characters in Pirates of the Caribbean\") in the [_Pirates of\nthe Caribbean_ series](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_\\(film_series\\) \"Pirates\nof the Caribbean \\(film series\\)\").[2] Bailie is also a professional\nphotographer, specialising in portrait photography. He has a studio in [West\nKensington](/wiki/West_Kensington \"West Kensington\"), London.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Life and career\n  * 2 Filmography\n  * 3 TV\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Life and\ncareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=David_Bailie&action=edit&section=1&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Life and career\")]\n\nBailie was born in Springs, South Africa, and went to boarding school in\n[Swaziland](/wiki/Swaziland \"Swaziland\"), before emigrating to\n[Rhodesia](/wiki/Rhodesia \"Rhodesia\") (now [Zimbabwe](/wiki/Zimbabwe\n\"Zimbabwe\")) with his family in 1952. His first acting experience soon after\nschool in 1955 was an amateur production of _[Doctor in the\nHouse](/wiki/Doctor_in_the_House \"Doctor in the House\")_ , which persuaded him\nhe wanted to be an actor.[3] After leaving school he worked in a bank and then\nfor Central African Airlines. In 1958, he made his first trip from Rhodesia to\n[Britain](/wiki/UK \"UK\").\n\nIn 1960 he moved to Britain and landed his first small role in the film\n_[Flame in the Streets](/wiki/Flame_in_the_Streets \"Flame in the Streets\")_\n(1961) and then played one of the [bell boys](/wiki/Bellhop \"Bellhop\") in\n[Arthur Kopit](/wiki/Arthur_Kopit \"Arthur Kopit\")'s _[Oh Dad, Poor Dad,\nMamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So\nSad](/wiki/Oh_Dad,_Poor_Dad,_Mamma%27s_Hung_You_in_the_Closet_and_I%27m_Feelin%27_So_Sad\n\"Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad\")_\n(1961) with [Stella Adler](/wiki/Stella_Adler \"Stella Adler\") playing Madame\nRosepettle. He then bluffed his way into weekly [repertory](/wiki/Repertory\n\"Repertory\") in [Barrow-in-Furness](/wiki/Barrow-in-Furness \"Barrow-in-\nFurness\") as juvenile lead – terrified the while that he would be exposed as\ntotally inexperienced.\n\nRecognising the need for training, he auditioned three times for a bursary to\nthe [RADA](/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Dramatic_Art \"Royal Academy of Dramatic\nArt\")—each time being accepted only as a fee-paying student, which he couldn't\nafford. He finally sent for the last of his standby money (£200) he had left\nin Rhodesia and paid for the first term (1963). At the end of term he\npersuaded John Fernald to allow him free tuition for the next two years.\n\n[Terry Hands](/wiki/Terry_Hands \"Terry Hands\") was also a student at the same\ntime, but had left a little earlier than Bailie and formed the [Everyman\nTheatre](/wiki/Everyman_Theatre,_Liverpool \"Everyman Theatre, Liverpool\") with\nPeter James in Liverpool. On leaving RADA Bailie was invited to join the\nEveryman in 1964. Amongst other roles he played \"Tolen\" in _[The\nKnack...](/wiki/The_Knack_...and_How_to_Get_It \"The Knack ...and How to Get\nIt\")_ , \"Becket\" in _[Murder in the Cathedral](/wiki/Murder_in_the_Cathedral\n\"Murder in the Cathedral\")_ , \"Dion\" in _[The Great God\nBrown](/wiki/The_Great_God_Brown \"The Great God Brown\")_ ,\n\"[MacDuff](/wiki/Macduff_\\(Macbeth\\) \"Macduff \\(Macbeth\\)\")\" in\n_[Macbeth](/wiki/Macbeth \"Macbeth\")_ and\n\"[Lucky](/wiki/Lucky_\\(Waiting_for_Godot\\) \"Lucky \\(Waiting for Godot\\)\")\" in\n_[Waiting for Godot](/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot \"Waiting for Godot\")_.\n\nAfter a year there, he came back to London and auditioned for and was accepted\nby Sir [Laurence Olivier](/wiki/Laurence_Olivier \"Laurence Olivier\") joining\nthe [National Theatre](/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre \"Royal National Theatre\").\nHe played minor roles and also understudied Olivier in _Love for Love_.\n\nTerry Hands, who had by now joined the [Royal Shakespeare\nCompany](/wiki/Royal_Shakespeare_Company \"Royal Shakespeare Company\") (RSC) at\n[Stratford-upon-Avon](/wiki/Stratford-upon-Avon \"Stratford-upon-Avon\") (and\nlater became its artistic director), invited Bailie to join them as an\nassociate artist (1965). There he portrayed \"Florizel\" opposite [Judi\nDench](/wiki/Judi_Dench \"Judi Dench\")'s \"Perdita\" in _[The Winter's\nTale](/wiki/The_Winter%27s_Tale \"The Winter's Tale\")_ along with \"Valentine\"\nin _[The Two Gentlemen of Verona](/wiki/The_Two_Gentlemen_of_Verona \"The Two\nGentlemen of Verona\")_ , \"The Bastard\" in _[King\nJohn](/wiki/The_Life_and_Death_of_King_John \"The Life and Death of King\nJohn\")_ , \"Kozanka\" in _The Plebeians Rehearse the Uprising_ and \"Leslie\" in\n_[The Madness of Lady Bright](/wiki/The_Madness_of_Lady_Bright \"The Madness of\nLady Bright\")_.\n\nDuring the early 1970s he worked with [Stomu Yamashta](/wiki/Stomu_Yamashta\n\"Stomu Yamashta\") at his Red Buddha Theatre. He was cast as the lead in a show\ncalled _Raindog_ , requiring him to do everything from singing and dancing, to\nperforming Martial Arts and gymnastics – which he frankly admits been a demand\ntoo far and when Yamashta offered him a paltry sum for performing the\nopportunity was there to depart which he did. He was then cast by [Michael E.\nBriant](/wiki/Michael_E._Briant \"Michael E. Briant\") in 1976 to play the part\nof the villain \"Dask\" in the _[Doctor Who](/wiki/Doctor_Who \"Doctor Who\")_\nserial _[The Robots of Death](/wiki/The_Robots_of_Death \"The Robots of\nDeath\")_.[4] He also played in a number of other series prominent at the time.\n\nFor personal reasons Bailie then had a long recess in his acting career.\nBetween 1980 and 1989 he ran a furniture-making business. In 1990 he closed\nthat down and returned to acting, having in fact to virtually restart his\ncareer. It didn't help that at exactly this point he had to have a cancer\nremoved from his lip, which required learning to speak again. Whilst awaiting\nwork in the acting field he busied himself with CAD design, self-training and\nwriting computer programs and also doing health and safety work in the\nbuilding industry.\n\nIn the mid-1990s after playing alongside [Brian Glover](/wiki/Brian_Glover\n\"Brian Glover\") in _[The Canterbury Tales](/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales \"The\nCanterbury Tales\")_ he made a comeback in the film business as \"Skewer\" in\n_[Cutthroat Island](/wiki/Cutthroat_Island \"Cutthroat Island\")_ (1995), then\nplayed an English Judge in _[The Messenger: The Story of Joan of\nArc](/wiki/The_Messenger:_The_Story_of_Joan_of_Arc \"The Messenger: The Story\nof Joan of Arc\")_ (1999), and also \"The Engineer\" in\n_[Gladiator](/wiki/Gladiator_\\(2000_film\\) \"Gladiator \\(2000 film\\)\")_ (2000).\n\nBailie's best-known work in film is the role of \"Cotton\", a mute pirate who\nhas his tongue cut out, so he trained his parrot, also named Cotton, to speak\non his behalf, though it cannot say more than stock phrases. Bailie first\nappears as Cotton in _[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black\nPearl](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_The_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl \"Pirates\nof the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\")_ (2003) as one of the pirates\n[Jack Sparrow](/wiki/Jack_Sparrow \"Jack Sparrow\") chooses in Tortuga. He is\none of the _Black Pearl_ crewmembers to survive the\n[Kraken](/wiki/Kraken_\\(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean\\) \"Kraken \\(Pirates of the\nCaribbean\\)\") attack in the sequel _[Dead Man's\nChest](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_Dead_Man%27s_Chest \"Pirates of the\nCaribbean: Dead Man's Chest\")_ (2006), and also played Cotton in the third\ninstalment: _[At World's End](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_At_World%27s_End\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\")_ (2007).\n\nBailie also emerged as a radio actor. He played the mad scientist \"Taren\nCapel\", a re-incarnation of his earlier work from the 60s series _Doctor Who_.\nHe has recently been involved in two [Big Finish\nProductions](/wiki/Big_Finish_Productions \"Big Finish Productions\") audio\ndramas playing the \"[Celestial Toymaker](/wiki/Celestial_Toymaker \"Celestial\nToymaker\")\".\n\nBailie also works as a professional photographer, portraiture and landscapes\nbeing his speciality.[5]\n\nHe has established a YouTube channel _**mdebailes**_ to which he uploads\nreadings and performance excerpts.\n\n##\nFilmography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=David_Bailie&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Filmography\")]\n\nYear | Film | Role  \n---|---|---  \n1961 | _[Flame in the Streets](/wiki/Flame_in_the_Streets \"Flame in the Streets\")_ | Uncredited  \n1972 | _[Henry VIII and His Six Wives](/wiki/Henry_VIII_and_His_Six_Wives \"Henry VIII and His Six Wives\")_ | Norris  \n1973 | _[The Creeping Flesh](/wiki/The_Creeping_Flesh \"The Creeping Flesh\")_ | Young Doctor  \n1974 | _[Son of Dracula](/wiki/Son_of_Dracula_\\(1974_film\\) \"Son of Dracula \\(1974 film\\)\")_ | Chauffeur  \n1975 | _[Legend of the Werewolf](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Werewolf \"Legend of the Werewolf\")_ | Boulon  \n1977 | _[Golden Rendezvous](/wiki/Golden_Rendezvous \"Golden Rendezvous\")_ | Younger terrorist in car (uncredited)  \n1995 | _[Cutthroat Island](/wiki/Cutthroat_Island \"Cutthroat Island\")_ | Dawg's Pirate  \n1999 | _[The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc](/wiki/The_Messenger:_The_Story_of_Joan_of_Arc \"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\")_ | English Judge  \n2000 | _[Gladiator](/wiki/Gladiator_\\(2000_film\\) \"Gladiator \\(2000 film\\)\")_ | Engineer  \n2003 | _[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_The_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\")_ | Cotton  \n2005 | _Starfly_ | Commander / Doctor  \n2006 | _[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_Dead_Man%27s_Chest \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\")_ | Cotton  \n2007 | _[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_At_World%27s_End \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\")_ | Cotton  \n2007 | _Eddie Proctor_ | Eddie Proctor  \n2007 | _[The Comebacks](/wiki/The_Comebacks \"The Comebacks\")_ | Prisoner  \n2009 | _Shadows in the Wind_ | Mr. Behrman  \n2011 | _Pirates of the Caribbean: Tales of the Code – Wedlocked_ | Cotton  \n2014 | _[October](/wiki/October_1_\\(film\\) \"October 1 \\(film\\)\") 1_ | Ackerman  \n2015 | _Artificio Conceal_ | Vitruvius  \n  \n##\nTV[[edit](/w/index.php?title=David_Bailie&action=edit&section=3&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: TV\")]\n\nYear | TV Series | Role  \n---|---|---  \n1975 | _BBC[Play of the Month](/wiki/Play_of_the_Month \"Play of the Month\"): [The Little Minister](/w/index.php?title=The_Little_Minister_\\(play\\)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"The Little Minister \\(play\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ | Sergeant Davidson  \n1977 | _[Doctor Who](/wiki/Doctor_Who \"Doctor Who\"): [The Robots of Death](/wiki/The_Robots_of_Death \"The Robots of Death\")_ | Dask  \n1978 | _[Blake's 7](/wiki/Blake%27s_7 \"Blake's 7\")_: \"[Project Avalon](/wiki/List_of_Blake%27s_7_episodes \"List of Blake's 7 episodes\")\" | Chevner  \n1979 | _[The First Part of King Henry the Fourth, with the Life and Death of Henry Surnamed Hotspur](/wiki/Henry_IV,_Part_1 \"Henry IV, Part 1\")_ | Second Carrier  \n2001 | _Fire, Plague, War and Treason_ (mini-series) | Self (documentary series examining the plague years in Great Britain).  \n2001 | _[Attila](/wiki/Attila_\\(TV_miniseries\\) \"Attila \\(TV miniseries\\)\")_ | Shaman  \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=David_Bailie&action=edit&section=4&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Bailie, David 1937–\"](http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-no2009009664/). _World Cat_.
