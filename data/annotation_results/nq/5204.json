In [Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States\nCongress\"), it was passed by the Senate on April 8, 1864, and by the House on\nJanuary 31, 1865. The amendment was ratified by the required number of\n[states](/wiki/U.S._states \"U.S. states\") on December 6, 1865. On December 18,\n1865, [Secretary of State](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United\nStates Secretary of State\") [William H. Seward](/wiki/William_H._Seward\n\"William H. Seward\") proclaimed its adoption. It was the first of the three\n[Reconstruction Amendments](/wiki/Reconstruction_Amendments \"Reconstruction\nAmendments\") adopted following the [American Civil\nWar](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\").\n\nSince the [American Revolution](/wiki/American_Revolution \"American\nRevolution\"), states had divided into [states that allowed and states that\nprohibited slavery](/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states \"Slave states and free\nstates\"). Slavery was implicitly permitted in the original Constitution\nthrough provisions such as Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, commonly known as\nthe [Three-Fifths Compromise](/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise \"Three-Fifths\nCompromise\"), which detailed how each slave state's enslaved population would\nbe factored into its total population [count](/wiki/United_States_Census\n\"United States Census\") for the purposes of\n[apportioning](/wiki/Apportionment_\\(politics\\) \"Apportionment \\(politics\\)\")\nseats in the [United States House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\") and [direct\ntaxes](/wiki/Direct_tax#U.S._constitutional_law_sense \"Direct tax\") among the\nstates. Though many slaves had been declared free by President [Abraham\nLincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\")'s 1863 [Emancipation\nProclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation \"Emancipation Proclamation\"),\ntheir post-war status was uncertain. On April 8, 1864, the Senate passed an\namendment to abolish slavery. After one unsuccessful vote and extensive\nlegislative maneuvering by the Lincoln administration, the House followed suit\non January 31, 1865. The measure was swiftly ratified by nearly all [Northern\nstates](/wiki/Union_\\(American_Civil_War\\) \"Union \\(American Civil War\\)\"),\nalong with a sufficient number of border and \"reconstructed\" Southern states,\nto cause it to be adopted before the end of the year.\n\nThough the amendment formally abolished slavery throughout the United States,\nfactors such as [Black Codes](/wiki/Black_Codes_\\(United_States\\) \"Black Codes\n\\(United States\\)\"), white supremacist violence, and selective enforcement of\nstatutes continued to subject some black Americans to involuntary labor,\nparticularly in the South. In contrast to the other Reconstruction Amendments,\nthe Thirteenth Amendment was rarely cited in later case law, but has been used\nto strike down [peonage](/wiki/Peon \"Peon\") and some race-based discrimination\nas \"badges and incidents of slavery\". The Thirteenth Amendment applies to the\nactions of private citizens, while the\n[Fourteenth](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") and\n[Fifteenth](/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") Amendments apply only\nto [state actors](/wiki/State_actor \"State actor\"). The amendment also enables\nCongress to pass laws against [sex trafficking](/wiki/Sex_trafficking \"Sex\ntrafficking\") and other modern forms of slavery.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Text\n  * 2 Slavery in the United States\n  * 3 Proposal and ratification\n    * 3.1 Crafting the amendment\n    * 3.2 Passage by Congress\n    * 3.3 Ratification by the states\n  * 4 Effects\n    * 4.1 Political and economic change in the South\n  * 5 Congressional and executive enforcement\n    * 5.1 Peonage law\n  * 6 Penal labor exemption\n  * 7 Judicial interpretation\n    * 7.1 Black slaves and their descendants\n      * 7.1.1 _Jones_ and beyond\n    * 7.2 Other cases of involuntary servitude\n  * 8 Prior proposed Thirteenth Amendments\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 References\n    * 10.1 Citations\n    * 10.2 Bibliography\n    * 10.3 Primary sources\n  * 11 External links\n\n## Text\n\n> **Section 1.** Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a\n> punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall\n> exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n>\n> **Section 2.** Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\n> appropriate legislation.[1]\n\n## Slavery in the United States\n\nMain article: [Slavery in the United\nStates](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States \"Slavery in the United States\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Cicatrices_de_flagellation_sur_un_esclave.jpg/220px-\nCicatrices_de_flagellation_sur_un_esclave.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cicatrices_de_flagellation_sur_un_esclave.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cicatrices_de_flagellation_sur_un_esclave.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAbolitionist imagery focused on atrocities against slaves[2] (1863 photo of\n[Gordon](/wiki/Gordon_\\(slave\\) \"Gordon \\(slave\\)\"))\n\nThe institution of slavery existed in all of the original thirteen British\nNorth [American colonies](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies#Slaves \"Thirteen Colonies\").\nPrior to the Thirteenth Amendment, the [United States\nConstitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\")\n(adopted in 1789) did not expressly use the words _slave_ or _slavery_ but\nincluded several provisions about unfree persons. The [Three-Fifths\nCompromise](/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise \"Three-Fifths Compromise\") (in\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause 3) allocated Congressional representation based\n\"on the whole Number of free Persons\" and \"three fifths of all other Persons\".\nThis clause was a compromise between Southerners who wished slaves to be\ncounted as 'persons' for congressional representation and northerners\nrejecting these out of concern of too much power for the South, because\nrepresentation in the new Congress would be based on population in contrast to\nthe one-vote-for-one-state principle in the earlier [Continental\nCongress](/wiki/Continental_Congress \"Continental Congress\").[3] Under the\n[Fugitive Slave Clause](/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Clause \"Fugitive Slave Clause\")\n(Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3), \"No person held to Service or Labour in one\nState\" would be freed by escaping to another. [Article I, Section 9, Clause\n1](/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_9:_Limits_on_Congress\n\"Article One of the United States Constitution\") allowed Congress to pass\nlegislation outlawing the \"Importation of Persons\", but not until 1808.\nHowever, for purposes of the [Fifth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Fifth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\")—which states that, \"No person\nshall... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of\nlaw\"—slaves were understood as property.[4] Although abolitionists used the\nFifth Amendment to argue against slavery, it became part of the legal basis in\n_[Dred Scott v. Sandford](/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford \"Dred Scott v.\nSandford\")_ (1857) for treating slaves as property.[5]\n\nStimulated by the philosophy of the Declaration of Independence between 1777\nand 1804, every Northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition\nof slavery. Most of the slaves involved were household servants. No Southern\nstate did so, and the slave population of the South continued to grow, peaking\nat almost 4 million people in 1861. An [abolitionist\nmovement](/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States \"Abolitionism in the United\nStates\") headed by such figures as [William Lloyd\nGarrison](/wiki/William_Lloyd_Garrison \"William Lloyd Garrison\") grew in\nstrength in the North, calling for the end of slavery nationwide and\nexacerbating tensions between North and South. The [American Colonization\nSociety](/wiki/American_Colonization_Society \"American Colonization Society\"),\nan alliance between abolitionists who felt the races should be kept separated\nand slaveholders who feared the presence of freed blacks would encourage slave\nrebellions, called for the emigration and colonization of both free blacks and\nslaves to Africa. Its views were endorsed by politicians such as [Henry\nClay](/wiki/Henry_Clay \"Henry Clay\"), who feared that the main abolitionist\nmovement would provoke a civil war.[6] Proposals to eliminate slavery by\nconstitutional amendment were introduced by Representative [Arthur\nLivermore](/wiki/Arthur_Livermore \"Arthur Livermore\") in 1818 and by [John\nQuincy Adams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John Quincy Adams\") in 1839, but failed\nto gain significant traction.[7]\n\nAs the country continued to expand, the issue of slavery in its new\nterritories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that\nslaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all\nother forms of property.[8] The 1820 [Missouri\nCompromise](/wiki/Missouri_Compromise \"Missouri Compromise\") provided for the\nadmission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving\nthe Senate's [equality between the regions](/wiki/Slave_and_free_states \"Slave\nand free states\"). In 1846, the [Wilmot Proviso](/wiki/Wilmot_Proviso \"Wilmot\nProviso\") was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all\nterritories acquired in the [Mexican–American\nWar](/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War \"Mexican–American War\"); the Proviso\nrepeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate.[8] The [Compromise of\n1850](/wiki/Compromise_of_1850 \"Compromise of 1850\") temporarily defused the\nissue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger\n[Fugitive Slave Act](/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850 \"Fugitive Slave Act of\n1850\"), banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico\nand Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.[9]\n\nDespite the compromise, tensions between North and South continued to rise\nover the subsequent decade, inflamed by, amongst other things, the publication\nof the 1852 anti-slavery novel _[Uncle Tom's Cabin](/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\")_; [fighting between pro-slavery and abolitionist\nforces](/wiki/Bleeding_Kansas \"Bleeding Kansas\") in Kansas, beginning in 1854;\nthe 1857 _Dred Scott_ decision, which struck down provisions of the Compromise\nof 1850; abolitionist [John Brown's](/wiki/John_Brown_\\(abolitionist\\) \"John\nBrown \\(abolitionist\\)\") 1859 attempt to start a slave revolt at [Harpers\nFerry](/wiki/John_Brown%27s_raid_on_Harpers_Ferry \"John Brown's raid on\nHarpers Ferry\") and the 1860 election of slavery critic [Abraham\nLincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\") to the presidency. The\nSouthern states seceded from the Union in the months following Lincoln's\nelection, forming the [Confederate States of\nAmerica](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of America\"),\nand beginning the [American Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American\nCivil War\").\n\n## Proposal and ratification\n\n### Crafting the amendment\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/James_Mitchell_Ashley_-\n_Brady-Handy.jpg/220px-James_Mitchell_Ashley_-_Brady-\nHandy.jpg)](/wiki/File:James_Mitchell_Ashley_-_Brady-Handy.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:James_Mitchell_Ashley_-_Brady-Handy.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRepresentative [James Mitchell Ashley](/wiki/James_Mitchell_Ashley \"James\nMitchell Ashley\") proposed an amendment abolishing slavery in 1863.\n\nActing under presidential war powers, Lincoln issued the [Emancipation\nProclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation \"Emancipation Proclamation\") on\nJanuary 1, 1863, which proclaimed the freedom of slaves in the ten states that\nwere still in rebellion.[10] However, it did not affect the status of slaves\nin the [border states](/wiki/Border_states_\\(American_Civil_War\\) \"Border\nstates \\(American Civil War\\)\") that had remained loyal to the Union.[11] That\nDecember, Lincoln again used his war powers and issued a \"[Proclamation for\nAmnesty and Reconstruction](/wiki/Ten_percent_plan \"Ten percent plan\")\", which\noffered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union if they\nabolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10% of their voting\npopulation.[12] Southern states did not readily accept the deal, and the\nstatus of slavery remained uncertain.\n\nIn the final years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various proposals\nfor Reconstruction.[13] Some of these called for a constitutional amendment to\nabolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill\nproposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative [James Mitchell\nAshley](/wiki/James_Mitchell_Ashley \"James Mitchell Ashley\") of Ohio.[14][15]\nRepresentative [James F. Wilson](/wiki/James_F._Wilson \"James F. Wilson\") of\nIowa soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator [John\nB. Henderson](/wiki/John_B._Henderson \"John B. Henderson\") of Missouri\nsubmitted a [joint resolution](/wiki/Joint_resolution \"Joint resolution\") for\na constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The [Senate Judiciary\nCommittee](/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary \"United\nStates Senate Committee on the Judiciary\"), chaired by [Lyman\nTrumbull](/wiki/Lyman_Trumbull \"Lyman Trumbull\") of Illinois, became involved\nin merging different proposals for an amendment.\n\n[Radical Republicans](/wiki/Radical_Republicans \"Radical Republicans\") led by\nMassachusetts Senator [Charles Sumner](/wiki/Charles_Sumner \"Charles Sumner\")\nand Pennsylvania Representative [Thaddeus Stevens](/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens\n\"Thaddeus Stevens\") sought a more expansive version of the amendment.[16] On\nFebruary 8, 1864, Sumner submitted a constitutional amendment stating:\n\n> All persons are equal before the law, so that no person can hold another as\n> a slave; and the Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary and\n> proper to carry this declaration into effect everywhere in the United\n> States.[17][18]\n\nSumner tried to promote his own more expansive wording by circumventing the\nTrumbull-controlled Judiciary Committee, but failed.[19] On February 10, the\nSenate Judiciary Committee presented the Senate with an amendment proposal\nbased on drafts of Ashley, Wilson and Henderson.[20][21]\n\nThe Committee's version used text from the [Northwest\nOrdinance](/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance \"Northwest Ordinance\") of 1787, which\nstipulates, \"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the\nsaid [territory](/wiki/Northwest_Territory \"Northwest Territory\"), otherwise\nthan in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly\nconvicted.\"[22][23]:1786 Though using Henderson's proposed amendment as the\nbasis for its new draft, the Judiciary Committee removed language that would\nhave allowed a constitutional amendment to be adopted with only a majority\nvote in each House of Congress and ratification by two-thirds of the states\n(instead of two-thirds and three-fourths, respectively).[24]\n\n### Passage by Congress\n\nFurther information: [38th United States\nCongress](/wiki/38th_United_States_Congress \"38th United States Congress\")\n\nThe Senate passed the amendment on April 8, 1864, by a vote of 38 to 6; two\nDemocrats, [Reverdy Johnson](/wiki/Reverdy_Johnson \"Reverdy Johnson\") of\nMaryland and [James Nesmith](/wiki/James_Nesmith \"James Nesmith\") of Oregon\nvoted \"aye.\" However, just over two months later on June 15, the House failed\nto do so, with 93 in favor and 65 against, thirteen votes short of the two-\nthirds vote needed for passage; the vote split largely along party lines, with\nRepublicans supporting and Democrats opposing.[25] In the 1864 presidential\nrace, former [Free Soil Party](/wiki/Free_Soil_Party \"Free Soil Party\")\ncandidate [John C. Frémont](/wiki/John_C._Fr%C3%A9mont \"John C. Frémont\")\nthreatened a third-party run opposing Lincoln, this time on a platform\nendorsing an anti-slavery amendment. The Republican Party platform had, as\nyet, failed to include a similar plank, though Lincoln endorsed the amendment\nin a letter accepting his nomination.[26][27] Fremont withdrew from the race\non September 22, 1864 and endorsed Lincoln.[28]\n\nWith no Southern states represented, few members of Congress pushed moral and\nreligious arguments in favor of slavery. Democrats who opposed the amendment\ngenerally made arguments based on [federalism](/wiki/Federalism \"Federalism\")\nand [states' rights](/wiki/States%27_rights \"States' rights\").[29] Some argued\nthat the proposed change so violated the spirit of the Constitution that it\nwould not be a valid \"amendment\" but would instead constitute\n\"revolution\".[30] Representative White, among other opponents, warned that the\namendment would lead to full citizenship for blacks.[31]\n\nRepublicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized and argued for abolition as a\nnecessary step in national progress.[32] Amendment supporters also argued that\nthe slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the\nlower wages resulting from competition with [forced labor](/wiki/Unfree_labour\n\"Unfree labour\"), as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South.\nAdvocates said ending slavery would restore the [First\nAmendment](/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") and other constitutional rights\nviolated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.[31][33]\n\nWhite, Northern Republicans and some Democrats became excited about an\nabolition amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions.[34] Many blacks\nthough, particularly in the South, focused more on land ownership and\neducation as the key to liberation.[35] As slavery began to seem politically\nuntenable, an array of Northern Democrats successively announced their support\nfor the amendment, including Representative [James\nBrooks](/wiki/James_Brooks_\\(politician\\) \"James Brooks \\(politician\\)\"),[36]\nSenator [Reverdy Johnson](/wiki/Reverdy_Johnson \"Reverdy Johnson\"),[37] and\n[Tammany Hall](/wiki/Tammany_Hall \"Tammany Hall\"), a powerful New York\n[political machine](/wiki/Political_machine \"Political machine\").[38]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/AdoptionOf13thAmendment.jpg/220px-\nAdoptionOf13thAmendment.jpg)](/wiki/File:AdoptionOf13thAmendment.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AdoptionOf13thAmendment.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCelebration erupts after the amendment is passed by the House of\nRepresentatives.\n\nPresident Lincoln had had concerns that the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863\nmight be reversed or found invalid after the war. He saw constitutional\namendment as a more permanent solution.[39][40] He had remained outwardly\nneutral on the amendment because he considered it politically too\ndangerous.[41] Nonetheless, Lincoln's 1864 party platform resolved to abolish\nslavery by constitutional amendment.[42][43] After winning reelection in the\n[election of 1864](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1864 \"United\nStates presidential election, 1864\"), Lincoln made the passage of the\nThirteenth Amendment his top legislative priority, beginning with his efforts\nin Congress during its \"lame duck\" session.[44][45] Popular support for the\namendment mounted and Lincoln urged Congress on in his December 6, [1864 State\nof the Union Address](/wiki/1864_State_of_the_Union_Address \"1864 State of the\nUnion Address\"): \"there is only a question of _time_ as to when the proposed\namendment will go to the States for their action. And as it is to so go, at\nall events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?\"[46]\n\nLincoln instructed Secretary of State William H. Seward, Representative [John\nB. Alley](/wiki/John_B._Alley \"John B. Alley\") and others to procure votes by\nany means necessary, and they promised government posts and campaign\ncontributions to outgoing Democrats willing to switch sides.[47][48] Seward\nhad a large fund for direct bribes. Ashley, who reintroduced the measure into\nthe House, also lobbied several Democrats to vote in favor of the measure.[49]\nRepresentative Thaddeus Stevens later commented that \"the greatest measure of\nthe nineteenth century was passed by corruption aided and abetted by the\npurest man in America\"; however, Lincoln's precise role in making deals for\nvotes remains unknown.[50]\n\nRepublicans in Congress claimed a mandate for abolition, having gained in the\nelections for [Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_1864 \"United\nStates Senate elections, 1864\") and\n[House](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1864 \"United\nStates House of Representatives elections, 1864\").[51] The 1864 Democratic\nvice-presidential nominee, Representative [George H.\nPendleton](/wiki/George_H._Pendleton \"George H. Pendleton\"), led opposition to\nthe measure.[52] Republicans toned down their language of radical equality in\norder to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters.[53] In order to\nreassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social\nfabric, some Republicans explicitly promised that the amendment would leave\npatriarchy intact.[54]\n\nIn mid-January 1865, Speaker of the House [Schuyler\nColfax](/wiki/Schuyler_Colfax \"Schuyler Colfax\") estimated the amendment to be\nfive votes short of passage. Ashley postponed the vote.[55] At this point,\nLincoln intensified his push for the amendment, making direct emotional\nappeals to particular members of Congress.[56] On January 31, 1865, the House\ncalled another vote on the amendment, with neither side being certain of the\noutcome. With 183 House members present, 122 would have to vote \"aye\" to\nsecure passage of the resolution; however eight members abstained, reducing\nthe number to 117. Every Republican supported the measure, as well as 16\nDemocrats, almost all of them lame ducks. The amendment finally passed by a\nvote of 119 to 56,[57] narrowly reaching the required two-thirds majority.[58]\nThe House exploded into celebration, with some members openly weeping.[59]\nBlack onlookers, who had only been allowed to attend Congressional sessions\nsince the previous year, cheered from the galleries.[60]\n\nWhile under the Constitution, the President plays no formal role in the\namendment process, the joint resolution was sent to Lincoln for his\nsignature.[61] Under the usual signatures of the Speaker of the House and the\nPresident of the Senate, President Lincoln wrote the word \"Approved\" and added\nhis signature to the joint resolution on February 1, 1865.[62] On February 7,\nCongress passed a resolution affirming that the Presidential signature was\nunnecessary.[63] The Thirteenth Amendment is the only ratified amendment\nsigned by a President, although [James Buchanan](/wiki/James_Buchanan \"James\nBuchanan\") had signed the [Corwin Amendment](/wiki/Corwin_Amendment \"Corwin\nAmendment\") that the [36th Congress](/wiki/36th_United_States_Congress \"36th\nUnited States Congress\") had adopted and sent to the states in March\n1861.[64][65]\n\n### Ratification by the states\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/13th_amendment_ratification.svg/400px-13th_amendment_ratification.svg.png)](/wiki/File:13th_amendment_ratification.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:13th_amendment_ratification.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRatified amendment, 1865\n\nRatified amendment post-enactment, 1865–1870\n\nRatified amendment after first rejecting amendment, 1866–1995\n\n[Territories of the United States](/wiki/United_States_territory \"United\nStates territory\") in 1865, not yet states\n\nWhen the Thirteenth Amendment was submitted to the states on February 1, 1865,\nit was quickly taken up by several legislatures. By the end of the month it\nhad been ratified by eighteen states. Among them were the ex-Confederate\nstates of Virginia and Louisiana, where ratifications were submitted by\nReconstruction governments. These, along with subsequent ratifications from\nArkansas and Tennessee raised the issues of how many seceded states had\nlegally valid legislatures; and if there were fewer legislatures than states,\nif Article V required ratification by three-fourths of the states or three-\nfourths of the legally valid state legislatures.[66] President Lincoln in his\nlast speech, on April 11, 1865, called the question about whether the Southern\nstates were in or out of the Union a \"pernicious abstraction.\" Obviously, he\ndeclared, they were not \"in their proper practical relation with the Union\";\nwhence everyone's object should be to restore that relation.[67] Lincoln [was\nassassinated](/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln \"Assassination of Abraham\nLincoln\") three days later.\n\nWith Congress out of session, the new President, [Andrew\nJohnson](/wiki/Andrew_Johnson \"Andrew Johnson\"), began a period known as\n\"Presidential Reconstruction\", in which he personally oversaw the creation of\nnew state governments throughout the South. He oversaw the convening of state\npolitical conventions populated by delegates whom he deemed to be loyal. Three\nleading issues came before the conventions: secession itself, the abolition of\nslavery, and the Confederate war debt. Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi,\nNorth Carolina, and South Carolina held conventions in 1865, while Texas'\nconvention did not organize until March 1866.[68][69][70] Johnson hoped to\nprevent deliberation over whether to re-admit the Southern states by\naccomplishing full ratification before Congress reconvened in December. He\nbelieved he could silence those who wished to deny the Southern states their\nplace in the Union by pointing to how essential their assent had been to the\nsuccessful ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment.[71]\n\nPart of a series on  \n[Slavery](/wiki/Slavery \"Slavery\")  \n---  \n[![IJzeren voetring voor gevangenen

\nDirect negotiations between state governments and the Johnson administration\nensued. As the summer wore on, administration officials began including\nassurances of the measure's limited scope with their demands for ratification.\nJohnson himself suggested directly to the governors of Mississippi and North\nCarolina that they could proactively control the allocation of rights to\nfreedmen. Though Johnson obviously expected the freed people to enjoy at least\nsome civil rights, including, as he specified, the right to testify in court,\nhe wanted state lawmakers to know that the power to confer such rights would\nremain with the states.[72] When South Carolina provisional governor [Benjamin\nFranklin Perry](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_Perry \"Benjamin Franklin Perry\")\nobjected to the scope of the amendment's enforcement clause, Secretary of\nState Seward responded by telegraph that in fact the second clause \"is really\nrestraining in its effect, instead of enlarging the powers of Congress\".[72]\nWhite politicians throughout the South were concerned that Congress might cite\nthe amendment's enforcement powers as a way to authorize black suffrage.[73]\n\nWhen South Carolina ratified the amendment in November 1865, it issued its own\ninterpretive declaration that \"any attempt by Congress toward legislating upon\nthe political status of former slaves, or their civil relations, would be\ncontrary to the Constitution of the United States\".[23]:1786–1787[74] Alabama\nand Louisiana also declared that their ratification did not imply federal\npower to legislate on the status of former slaves.[23]:1787[75] During the\nfirst week of December, North Carolina and Georgia gave the amendment the\nfinal votes needed for it to become part of the Constitution.\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution on December 6, 1865,\nbased on the following ratifications:[76]\n\n  1. Illinois — February 1, 1865\n  2. Rhode Island — February 2, 1865\n  3. Michigan — February 3, 1865\n  4. Maryland — February 3, 1865\n  5. New York — February 3, 1865\n  6.

North Carolina — December 4, 1865\n  27. Georgia — December 6, 1865\n\nHaving been ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several\nstates (27 of the 36 states, including those that had been _in rebellion_),\nSecretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth\nAmendment had become valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the\nConstitution.[77] Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the\nthree ex-Confederate states that had given their assent, but with strings\nattached. Seward accepted their affirmative votes and brushed aside their\n_interpretive declarations_ without comment, challenge or acknowledgment.[78]\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment was subsequently ratified by:[76]\n\n  28. Oregon — December 8, 1865\n  29. California — December 19, 1865\n  30. Florida — December 28, 1865 (reaffirmed – June 9, 1868)\n  31. Iowa — January 15, 1866\n  32.

Mississippi — March 16, 1995; Certified – February 7, 2013[80] (after rejection – December 5, 1865)\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution 61 years after the\n[Twelfth Amendment](/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"). This is the longest\ninterval between constitutional amendments.[81]\n\n## Effects\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/13th_Amendment_Pg1of1_AC.jpg/190px-13th_Amendment_Pg1of1_AC.jpg)](/wiki/File:13th_Amendment_Pg1of1_AC.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:13th_Amendment_Pg1of1_AC.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAmendment XIII in the [National\nArchives](/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration \"National\nArchives and Records Administration\"), bearing the signature of Abraham\nLincoln\n\nThe impact of the abolition of slavery was felt quickly. When the Thirteenth\nAmendment became operational, the scope of Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation\nProclamation was widened to include the entire nation. Although the majority\nof Kentucky's slaves had been emancipated, 65,000–100,000 people remained to\nbe legally freed when the Amendment went into effect on December 18.[82][83]\nIn Delaware, where a large number of slaves had escaped during the war, nine\nhundred people became legally free.[83][84]\n\nIn addition to abolishing slavery and prohibiting involuntary servitude,\nexcept as a punishment for crime, the Thirteenth Amendment also nullified the\n[Fugitive Slave Clause](/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Clause \"Fugitive Slave Clause\")\nand the [Three-Fifths Compromise](/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise \"Three-Fifths\nCompromise\"). The population of a state originally included (for congressional\napportionment purposes) all \"free persons\", three-fifths of \"other persons\"\n(i.e., [slaves](/wiki/Slave \"Slave\")) and excluded untaxed [Native\nAmericans](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native Americans in\nthe United States\"). The Three-Fifths Compromise was a provision in the\nConstitution that required three-fifths of the population of slaves be counted\nfor purposes of apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and\ntaxes among the states. This compromise had the effect of increasing the\npolitical power of slave-holding states by increasing their share of seats in\nthe House of Representatives, and consequently their share in the [Electoral\nCollege](/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College \"United States Electoral\nCollege\") (where a state's influence over the election of the President is\ntied to the size of its congressional delegation).[85][86]\n\nEven as the Thirteenth Amendment was working its way through the ratification\nprocess, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the\npotential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation\nof the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of\nfreed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states\nwould dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of\nRepresentatives.[87][88] Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by\nattracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black\npopulation.[87][89][90]\n\n### Political and economic change in the South\n\nSouthern culture remained deeply racist, and those blacks who remained faced a\ndangerous situation. J. J. Gries reported to the [Joint Committee on\nReconstruction](/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Reconstruction \"Joint Committee on\nReconstruction\"): \"There is a kind of innate feeling, a lingering hope among\nmany in the South that slavery will be regalvanized in some shape or other.\nThey tried by their laws to make a worse slavery than there was before, for\nthe freedman has not the protection which the master from interest gave him\nbefore.\"[91] [W. E. B. Du Bois](/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois \"W. E. B. Du Bois\")\nwrote in 1935:\n\n> Slavery was not abolished even after the Thirteenth Amendment. There were\n> four million freedmen and most of them on the same plantation, doing the\n> same work that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been\n> interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting\n> about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes\n> modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the\n> camps of the soldiers or on the streets of the cities, homeless, sick, and\n> impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and,\n> save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without\n> protection.[92][93]\n\nOfficial emancipation did not substantially alter the economic situation of\nmost blacks who remained in the south.[94]\n\nAs the amendment still permitted labor as punishment for convicted criminals,\nSouthern states responded with what historian [Douglas A.\nBlackmon](/wiki/Douglas_A._Blackmon \"Douglas A. Blackmon\") called \"an array of\ninterlocking laws essentially intended to criminalize black life\".[95] These\nlaws, passed or updated after emancipation, were known as [Black\nCodes](/wiki/Black_Codes_\\(United_States\\) \"Black Codes \\(United\nStates\\)\").[88] Mississippi was the first state to pass such codes, with an\n1865 law titled \"An Act to confer Civil Rights on Freedmen\".[96] The\nMississippi law required black workers to contract with white farmers by\nJanuary 1 of each year or face punishment for vagrancy.[95] Blacks could be\nsentenced to forced labor for crimes including petty theft, using obscene\nlanguage, or selling cotton after sunset.[97] States passed new, strict\n[vagrancy](/wiki/Vagrancy_\\(people\\) \"Vagrancy \\(people\\)\") laws that were\nselectively enforced against blacks without white protectors.[95][98] The\nlabor of these convicts was then sold to farms, factories, lumber camps,\nquarries, and mines.[99]\n\nAfter its ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South\nCarolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes.[100] The\nBlack Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable\nbehaviors for anyone with more than one black great-grandparent. Under these\nCodes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few\nConstitutional rights.[101] Restrictions on [black land\nownership](/wiki/Forty_acres_and_a_mule \"Forty acres and a mule\") threatened\nto make economic subservience permanent.[35]\n\nSome states mandated indefinitely long periods of child \"apprenticeship\".[102]\nSome laws did not target Blacks specifically, but instead affected farm\nworkers, most of whom were Black. At the same time, many states passed laws to\nactively prevent Blacks from acquiring property.[103]\n\n## Congressional and executive enforcement\n\nAs its first [enforcement\nlegislation](/wiki/Congressional_power_of_enforcement \"Congressional power of\nenforcement\"), Congress passed the [Civil Rights Act of\n1866](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1866 \"Civil Rights Act of 1866\"), guaranteeing\nblack Americans citizenship and equal protection of the law, though not the\nright to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several [Freedmen's\nBureau bills](/wiki/Freedmen%27s_Bureau_bills \"Freedmen's Bureau bills\").\nPresident Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but Congress overrode his vetoes\nto pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.[104][105]\n\nProponents of the Act, including Trumbull and Wilson, argued that Section 2 of\nthe Thirteenth Amendment authorized the federal government to legislate civil\nrights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality\nconditions were distinct from slavery.[23]:1788–1790 Seeking more substantial\njustification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn\nthe legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the\nConstitution: the [Fourteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") (1868) defining\ncitizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the [Fifteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") (1870) banning racial\nvoting restrictions.[106]\n\nThe [Freedmen's Bureau](/wiki/Freedmen%27s_Bureau \"Freedmen's Bureau\")\nenforced the amendment locally, providing a degree of support for people\nsubject to the Black Codes.[107] Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment\nestablished the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky.[108] The Civil\nRights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks\naccess to the federal courts. The [Enforcement Acts](/wiki/Enforcement_Acts\n\"Enforcement Acts\") of 1870–1871 and the [Civil Rights Act of\n1875](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1875 \"Civil Rights Act of 1875\"), in combating\nthe violence and intimidation of white supremacy, were also part of the effort\nto end slave conditions for Southern blacks.[109] However, the effect of these\nlaws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost\nauthority in the South, particularly after the [Compromise of\n1877](/wiki/Compromise_of_1877 \"Compromise of 1877\") ended\n[Reconstruction](/wiki/Reconstruction_Era \"Reconstruction Era\") in exchange\nfor a Republican presidency.[110]\n\n### Peonage law\n\nSouthern business owners sought to reproduce the profitable arrangement of\nslavery with a system called [peonage](/wiki/Peonage \"Peonage\"), in which\ndisproportionately black workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work\nindefinitely because of their debt.[111][112] Peonage continued well through\nReconstruction and ensnared a large proportion of black workers in the\nSouth.[113] These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work\ndangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist [Jim Crow\nlaws](/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws \"Jim Crow laws\") that governed the South.[112]\nPeonage differed from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary\nand did not allow the sale of people in exactly the same fashion. However, a\nperson's debt—and by extension a person—could still be sold, and the system\nresembled antebellum slavery in many ways.[114]\n\nWith the [Peonage Act of 1867](/wiki/Peonage_Act_of_1867 \"Peonage Act of\n1867\"), Congress abolished \"the holding of any person to service or labor\nunder the system known as peonage\",[115] specifically banning \"the voluntary\nor involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any\ndebt or obligation, or otherwise.\"[116]\n\nIn 1939, the Department of Justice created the Civil Rights Section, which\nfocused primarily on [First\nAmendment](/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") and [labor](/wiki/Labor_rights\n\"Labor rights\") rights.[117] The increasing scrutiny of\n[totalitarianism](/wiki/Totalitarianism \"Totalitarianism\") in the lead-up to\nWorld War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary\nservitude, abroad and at home.[118] The U.S. sought to counter foreign\npropaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the\nSouthern peonage system.[119] Under the leadership of Attorney General\n[Francis Biddle](/wiki/Francis_Biddle \"Francis Biddle\"), the Civil Rights\nSection invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the\nReconstruction Era as the basis for its actions.[120]\n\nIn 1947, the DOJ successfully prosecuted Elizabeth Ingalls for keeping\ndomestic servant Dora L. Jones in conditions of slavery. The court found that\nJones \"was a person wholly subject to the will of defendant; that she was one\nwho had no freedom of action and whose person and services were wholly under\nthe control of defendant and who was in a state of enforced compulsory service\nto the defendant.\"[121] The Thirteenth Amendment enjoyed a swell of attention\nduring this period, but from _[Brown v. Board of\nEducation](/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education \"Brown v. Board of Education\")_\n(1954) until _[Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer\nCo.](/wiki/Jones_v._Alfred_H._Mayer_Co. \"Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.\")_\n(1968) it was again eclipsed by the Fourteenth Amendment.[122]\n\n## Penal labor exemption\n\nSee also: [Penal labor in the United\nStates](/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States \"Penal labor in the United\nStates\") and [Convict lease](/wiki/Convict_lease \"Convict lease\")\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment exempts penal labor from its prohibition of forced\nlabor. This allows prisoners who have been convicted of crimes (not those\nmerely awaiting trial) to be required to perform labor or else face punishment\nwhile in custody.[123]\n\nFew records of the committee's deliberations during the drafting of the\nThirteenth Amendment survived, and the debate in both Congress and the state\nlegislatures that followed featured almost no discussion of this provision. It\nwas apparently considered noncontroversial at the time, or at least\nlegislators gave it little thought.[123] There does exist records of the\nreason for this exemption, albeit more removed in time; the drafters based the\namendment's phrasing on the [Northwest Ordinance of\n1787](/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance \"Northwest Ordinance\"), which features an\nidentical exception.[123] [Thomas Jefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas\nJefferson\") authored an early version of that ordinance's anti-slavery clause,\nincluding the exception of punishment for a crime, and also sought to prohibit\nslavery in general after 1800. Jefferson was an admirer of the works of\nItalian criminologist [Cesare Beccaria](/wiki/Cesare_Beccaria \"Cesare\nBeccaria\").[123] Beccaria's _[On Crimes and\nPunishments](/wiki/On_Crimes_and_Punishments \"On Crimes and Punishments\")_\nsuggested that the [death penalty](/wiki/Death_penalty \"Death penalty\") should\nbe abolished and replaced with a lifetime of enslavement for the worst\ncriminals; Jefferson likely included the clause due to his agreement with\nBeccaria. Beccaria, while attempting to reduce \"legal barbarism\" of the 1700s,\nconsidered forced labor one of the few harsh punishments acceptable; for\nexample, he advocated slave labor as a just punishment for\n[robbery](/wiki/Robbery \"Robbery\"), so that the thief's labor could be used to\npay recompense to their victims and to society.[124] Penal \"hard labor\" has\nancient origins, and was adopted early in American history (as in Europe)\noften as a substitute for capital or corporal punishment.[125]\n\nSince ratification, various commentators have accused states of abusing this\nprovision to re-establish systems similar to slavery, or of otherwise\nexploiting such labor in a manner unfair to local labor. The [Black\nCodes](/wiki/Black_Codes_\\(United_States\\) \"Black Codes \\(United States\\)\") in\nthe South criminalized \"[vagrancy](/wiki/Vagrancy_\\(people\\) \"Vagrancy\n\\(people\\)\")\", which was largely enforced against freed slaves. Later,\n[convict lease](/wiki/Convict_lease \"Convict lease\") programs in the South\nallowed local plantations to rent inexpensive prisoner labor.[126] While many\nof these programs have been phased out (leasing of convicts was forbidden by\nPresident [Franklin Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_Roosevelt \"Franklin Roosevelt\")\nin 1941), prison labor continues in America under a variety of justifications.\nPrison labor programs vary widely; some are uncompensated prison maintenance\ntasks, some are for local government maintenance tasks, some are for local\nbusinesses, and others are closer to internships. Modern rationales for prison\nlabor programs often include reduction of recidivism and re-acclimation to\nsociety; the idea is that such labor programs will make it easier for the\nprisoner upon release to find gainful employment rather than relapse to\ncriminality. However, this topic is not well-studied, and much of the work\noffered is so menial as to be unlikely to improve employment prospects.[127]\nAs of 2017, most prison labor programs do compensate prisoners, but generally\nwith very low wages. What wages they do earn are often heavily\n[garnished](/wiki/Garnishment \"Garnishment\"), with as much as 80% of a\nprisoner's paycheck withheld in the harshest cases.[128]\n\n## Judicial interpretation\n\nIn contrast to the other \"Reconstruction Amendments\", the Thirteenth Amendment\nwas rarely cited in later case law. As historian Amy Dru Stanley summarizes,\n\"beyond a handful of landmark rulings striking down debt peonage, ﬂagrant\ninvoluntary servitude, and some instances of race-based violence and\ndiscrimination, the Thirteenth Amendment has never been a potent source of\nrights claims\".[129][130]\n\n### Black slaves and their descendants\n\n_U. S. v. Rhodes_ (1866),[131] one of the first Thirteenth Amendment cases,\ntested the Constitutionality of provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1866\nthat granted blacks redress in the federal courts. Kentucky law prohibited\nblacks from testifying against whites—an arrangement which compromised the\nability of Nancy Talbot (\"a citizen of the United States of the African race\")\nto reach justice against a white person accused of robbing her. After Talbot\nattempted to try the case in federal court, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled\nthis federal option unconstitutional. [Noah Swayne](/wiki/Noah_Swayne \"Noah\nSwayne\") (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court)\noverturned the Kentucky decision, holding that without the material\nenforcement provided by the Civil Rights Act, slavery would not truly be\nabolished.[132][133] With _In Re Turner_ (1867), Chief Justice [Salmon P.\nChase](/wiki/Salmon_P._Chase \"Salmon P. Chase\") ordered freedom for Elizabeth\nTurner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former\nmaster.[134]\n\nIn _[Blyew v. U.S.](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Blyew_v._United_States\n\"s:Blyew v. United States\")_ , (1872)[135] the Supreme Court heard another\nCivil Rights Act case relating to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and\nGeorge Kennard were white men visiting the cabin of a black family, the\nFosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster\nand hit him twice in the head with an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's\nparents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong.\nThey severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would\nnot allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But\nfederal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard\nguilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that\nthe Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only\nliving people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts\neffectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in\nmurder cases. Swayne and [Joseph P. Bradley](/wiki/Joseph_P._Bradley \"Joseph\nP. Bradley\") dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects,\nthe Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial\noppression.[136]\n\nThough based on a technicality, the _Blyew_ case set a precedent in state and\nfederal courts that led to the erosion of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment\npowers. The Supreme Court continued along this path in the _[Slaughter-House\nCases](/wiki/Slaughter-House_Cases \"Slaughter-House Cases\")_ (1873), which\nupheld a state-sanctioned monopoly of white butchers. In _[United States v.\nCruikshank](/wiki/United_States_v._Cruikshank \"United States v. Cruikshank\")_\n(1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court\ndecision to exonerate perpetrators of the [Colfax\nmassacre](/wiki/Colfax_massacre \"Colfax massacre\") and invalidate the\n[Enforcement Act of 1870](/wiki/Enforcement_Act_of_1870 \"Enforcement Act of\n1870\").[109]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/John-Marshall-Harlan-\nsketch.jpg/220px-John-Marshall-Harlan-sketch.jpg)](/wiki/File:John-Marshall-\nHarlan-sketch.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:John-Marshall-Harlan-sketch.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJohn Marshall Harlan became known as \"The Great Dissenter\" for his minority\nopinions favoring powerful Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.[137]\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment was not solely a ban on chattel slavery, but also\ncovers a much broader array of labor arrangements and social\ndeprivations.[138] As the U.S. Supreme Court explicated in the [Slaughter-\nHouse Cases](/wiki/Slaughter-House_Cases \"Slaughter-House Cases\") (1873) with\nrespect to the\n[Fourteenth](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") and\n[Fifteenth](/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") Amendment and the\nThirteenth Amendment in special:\n\n> Undoubtedly while negro slavery alone was in the mind of the Congress which\n> proposed the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now\n> or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall\n> develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this\n> amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are\n> assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the\n> protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party\n> interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we\n> wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any\n> section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the\n> purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil\n> which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to\n> the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far\n> as constitutional law can accomplish it.[139]\n\nIn the _[Civil Rights Cases](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Cases \"Civil Rights Cases\")_\n(1883),[140] the Supreme Court reviewed five consolidated cases dealing with\nthe [Civil Rights Act of 1875](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1875 \"Civil Rights\nAct of 1875\"), which outlawed racial discrimination at \"inns, public\nconveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places of public amusement\".\nThe Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment did not ban most forms of racial\ndiscrimination by non-government actors.[141] In the majority decision,\nBradley wrote (again in non-binding dicta) that the Thirteenth Amendment\nempowered Congress to attack \"badges and incidents of slavery\". However, he\ndistinguished between \"fundamental rights\" of citizenship, protected by the\nThirteenth Amendment, and the \"social rights of men and races in the\ncommunity\".[142] The majority opinion held that \"it would be running the\nslavery argument into the ground to make it apply to every act of\ndiscrimination which a person may see fit to make as to guests he will\nentertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car; or\nadmit to his concert or theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse\nor business.\"[143] In his solitary dissent, [John Marshall\nHarlan](/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan \"John Marshall Harlan\") (a Kentucky lawyer\nwho changed his mind about civil rights law after witnessing organized racist\nviolence) argued that \"such discrimination practiced by corporations and\nindividuals in the exercise of their public or quasi-public functions is a\nbadge of servitude, the imposition of which congress may prevent under its\npower.\"[144]\n\nThe Court in the _Civil Rights Cases_ also held that appropriate legislation\nunder the amendment could go beyond nullifying state laws establishing or\nupholding slavery, because the amendment \"has a reflex character also,\nestablishing and decreeing universal civil and political freedom throughout\nthe United States\" and thus Congress was empowered \"to pass all laws necessary\nand proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United\nStates.\"[140] The Court stated about the scope the amendment:\n\n> This amendment, as well as the\n> [Fourteenth](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n> \"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), is undoubtedly\n> self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are\n> applicable to any existing state of circumstances.

Still,\n> legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and\n> circumstances to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress\n> for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation may be primary\n> and direct in its character, for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of\n> State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration\n> that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the\n> United States.[140]\n\nAttorneys in _[Plessy v. Ferguson](/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson \"Plessy v.\nFerguson\")_ (1896)[145] argued that [racial\nsegregation](/wiki/Racial_segregation \"Racial segregation\") involved\n\"observances of a servile character coincident with the incidents of slavery\",\nin violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. In their brief to the Supreme Court,\nPlessy's lawyers wrote that \"distinction of race and caste\" was inherently\nunconstitutional.[146] The Supreme Court rejected this reasoning and upheld\nstate laws enforcing segregation under the \"[separate but\nequal](/wiki/Separate_but_equal \"Separate but equal\")\" doctrine. In the (7–1)\nmajority decision, the Court found that \"a statute which implies merely a\nlegal distinction between the white and colored races—a distinction which is\nfounded on the color of the two races and which must always exist so long as\nwhite men are distinguished from the other race by color—has no tendency to\ndestroy the legal equality of the two races, or reestablish a state of\ninvoluntary servitude.\"[147] Harlan dissented, writing: \"The thin disguise of\n'equal' accommodations for passengers in railroad coaches will not mislead any\none, nor, atone for the wrong this day done.\"[148]\n\nIn _[Hodges v. United States](/wiki/Hodges_v._United_States \"Hodges v. United\nStates\")_ (1906),[149] the Court struck down a federal statute providing for\nthe punishment of two or more people who \"conspire to injure, oppress,\nthreaten or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any\nright or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United\nStates\". A group of white men in Arkansas conspired to violently prevent eight\nblack workers from performing their jobs at a lumber mill; the group was\nconvicted by a federal grand jury. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal\nstatute, which outlawed conspiracies to deprive citizens of their liberty, was\nnot authorized by the Thirteenth Amendment. It held that \"no mere personal\nassault or trespass or appropriation operates to reduce the individual to a\ncondition of slavery\". Harlan dissented, maintaining his opinion that the\nThirteenth Amendment should protect freedom beyond \"physical restraint\".[150]\n_Corrigan v. Buckley_ (1922) reaffirmed the interpretation from _Hodges_ ,\nfinding that the amendment does not apply to [restrictive\ncovenants](/wiki/Restrictive_covenant \"Restrictive covenant\").\n\nEnforcement of federal civil rights law in the South created numerous peonage\ncases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled\nin _Clyatt v. United States_ (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It\nheld that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into\ncontract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition)\ninvoluntary.[151]\n\nIn _[Bailey v. Alabama](/wiki/Bailey_v._Alabama \"Bailey v. Alabama\")_ the U.S.\nSupreme Court again reaffirmed its holding that Thirteenth Amendment was not\nsolely a ban on chattel slavery, but also covers a much broader array of labor\narrangements and social deprivations[138] In addition to the aforesaid the\nCourt also ruled on Congress enforcement power under the Thirteenth Amendment.\nThe Court said:\n\n> The plain intention [of the amendment] was to abolish slavery of whatever\n> name and form and all its badges and incidents; to render impossible any\n> state of bondage; to make labor free, by prohibiting that control by which\n> the personal service of one man is disposed of or coerced for another's\n> benefit, which is the essence of involuntary servitude. While the Amendment\n> was self-executing, so far as its terms were applicable to any existing\n> condition, Congress was authorized to secure its complete enforcement by\n> appropriate legislation.[152]\n\n#### _Jones_ and beyond\n\nLegal histories cite _[Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer\nCo.](/wiki/Jones_v._Alfred_H._Mayer_Co. \"Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.\")_\n(1968) as a turning point of Thirteen Amendment jurisprudence.[153][154] The\nSupreme Court confirmed in _Jones_ that Congress may act \"rationally\" to\nprevent private actors from imposing \"badges and incidents of\nservitude\".[153][155] The Joneses were a black couple in [St. Louis County,\nMissouri](/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Missouri \"St. Louis County, Missouri\") who\nsued a real estate company for refusing to sell them a house. The Court held:\n\n> Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to\n> determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the\n> authority to translate that determination into effective legislation. ...\n> this Court recognized long ago that, whatever else they may have\n> encompassed, the badges and incidents of slavery – its \"burdens and\n> disabilities\" – included restraints upon \"those fundamental rights which are\n> the essence of civil freedom, namely, the same right ... to inherit,\n> purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.\"\n> [Civil Rights Cases](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Cases \"Civil Rights Cases\"), 109 U.\n> S. 3, 109 U. S. 22.[156]\n\n> Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil War to restrict the free\n> exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the\n> exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the\n> Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes\n> their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too\n> is a relic of slavery.\n\n> Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a\n> promise of freedom—freedom to \"go and come at pleasure\" and to \"buy and sell\n> when they please\"—would be left with \"a mere paper guarantee\" if Congress\n> were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase\n> the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man. At the very least,\n> the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth\n> Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the\n> right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that\n> being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment\n> made a promise the Nation cannot keep.[157]\n\nThe Court in _Jones_ reopened the issue of linking racism in contemporary\nsociety to the history of slavery in the United States.[158]\n\nThe _Jones_ precedent has been used to justify Congressional action to protect\nmigrant workers and target sex trafficking.[159] The direct enforcement power\nfound in the Thirteenth Amendment contrasts with that of the Fourteenth, which\nallows only responses to institutional discrimination of [state\nactors](/wiki/State_actor \"State actor\").[160]\n\n### Other cases of involuntary servitude\n\nThe Supreme Court has taken an especially narrow view of involuntary servitude\nclaims made by people not descended from black (African) slaves. In _Robertson\nv. Baldwin_ (1897), a group of merchant seamen challenged federal statutes\nwhich criminalized a seaman's failure to complete their contractual term of\nservice. The Court ruled that seamen's contracts had been considered unique\nfrom time immemorial, and that \"the amendment was not intended to introduce\nany novel doctrine with respect to certain descriptions of service which have\nalways been treated as exceptional\". In this case, as in numerous \"badges and\nincidents\" cases, Justice Harlan authored a dissent favoring broader\nThirteenth Amendment protections.[161]\n\nIn _[Selective Draft Law Cases](/wiki/Selective_Draft_Law_Cases \"Selective\nDraft Law Cases\")_ ,[162] the Supreme Court ruled that the [military\ndraft](/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States \"Conscription in the United\nStates\") was not \"involuntary servitude\". In _[United States v.\nKozminski](/wiki/United_States_v._Kozminski \"United States v. Kozminski\")_\n,[163] the Supreme Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment did not prohibit\ncompulsion of servitude through psychological coercion.[164][165] _Kozminski_\ndefined involuntary servitude for purposes of criminal prosecution as \"a\ncondition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant\nby the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by the use or\nthreat of coercion through law or the legal process. This definition\nencompasses cases in which the defendant holds the victim in servitude by\nplacing him or her in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal\ncoercion.\"[163]\n\nThe [U.S. Courts of Appeals](/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals \"United\nStates courts of appeals\"), in _[Immediato v. Rye Neck School\nDistrict](/wiki/Immediato_v._Rye_Neck_School_District \"Immediato v. Rye Neck\nSchool District\")_ , _Herndon v. Chapel Hill_ , and _Steirer v. Bethlehem\nSchool District_ , have ruled that the use of [community\nservice](/wiki/Community_service \"Community service\") as a high school\ngraduation requirement did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment.[166]\n\n## Prior proposed Thirteenth Amendments\n\nDuring the six decades following the 1804 ratification of the Twelfth\nAmendment two proposals to amend the Constitution were adopted by Congress and\nsent to the states for ratification. Neither has been ratified by the number\nof states necessary to become part of the Constitution. Commonly known as the\n[Titles of Nobility Amendment](/wiki/Titles_of_Nobility_Amendment \"Titles of\nNobility Amendment\") and the [Corwin Amendment](/wiki/Corwin_Amendment \"Corwin\nAmendment\"), both are referred to as _Article Thirteen_ , as was the\nsuccessful Thirteenth Amendment, in the [joint\nresolution](/wiki/Joint_resolution \"Joint resolution\") passed by Congress.\n\n  * The Titles of Nobility Amendment (pending before the states since May 1, 1810) would, if ratified, strip [citizenship](/wiki/Citizenship_in_the_United_States \"Citizenship in the United States\") from any United States citizen who accepts a title of [nobility](/wiki/Nobility \"Nobility\") or honor from a foreign country without the consent of Congress.[167]\n  * The Corwin Amendment (pending before the states since March 2, 1861) would, if ratified, [shield](/wiki/Entrenched_clause \"Entrenched clause\") \"domestic institutions\" of the states (in 1861 this was a common euphemism for slavery) from the [constitutional amendment process](/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article Five of the United States Constitution\") and from abolition or interference by Congress.[168][169]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Crittenden Compromise](/wiki/Crittenden_Compromise \"Crittenden Compromise\")\n  * [National Freedom Day](/wiki/National_Freedom_Day \"National Freedom Day\")\n  * [Slavery Abolition Act 1833](/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833 \"Slavery Abolition Act 1833\")\n  * [Slave Trade Acts](/wiki/Slave_Trade_Act \"Slave Trade Act\")\n  * [List of amendments to the United States Constitution](/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"List of amendments to the United States Constitution\")\n  * [History of unfree labor in the United States](/wiki/History_of_unfree_labor_in_the_United_States \"History of unfree labor in the United States\")\n  * [United States labor law](/wiki/United_States_labor_law \"United States labor law\")\n  * [_13th_](/wiki/13th_\\(film\\) \"13th \\(film\\)\"), a 2016 documentary on the Thirteenth Amendment\n\n## References\n\n### Citations\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"13th Amendment\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiii.html). _Legal Information Institute_.
