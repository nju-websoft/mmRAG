It endeavors to stay\ntrue to the spirit of the Book.\"[31] [Roma Downey](/wiki/Roma_Downey \"Roma\nDowney\") stated in an interview, \"we had a great team of scholars and\ntheologians helping us, making sure that we told these stories accurately and\ntruthfully,\"[32] However, many of the story elements in the series have been\ncriticized as deviating from the events described in the traditional text, and\nusing too many [creative licenses](/wiki/Artistic_license \"Artistic license\").\nThese are included below:\n\n  * In the Bible, [Noah](/wiki/Noah \"Noah\")'s three sons are full grown men, whereas in the TV series they are depicted as boys.\n  * In the Book of Genesis, the angelic visitors were approached by Lot who insisted that they stay with him. Then they feasted with Lot in his home. The series shows the angels approaching Lot, begging for help with no hospitality extended to them.[33] (Genesis 19:1-5)\n  * The text describes a mob gathered outside of [Lot](/wiki/Lot_\\(biblical_person\\) \"Lot \\(biblical person\\)\")'s home wanting to rape his two angelic visitors, and Lot offering his daughters instead. The series omits this.[34][35] (Genesis 19:4-10)\n  * At the destruction of [Sodom](/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah \"Sodom and Gomorrah\"), the series shows the angels slaughtering some of the city's inhabitants. Critics refer to these as \"Ninja Angels\". This is not in the text.[36] (Genesis 19:1-17)\n  * The series shows Abraham traveling with Isaac, a very short distance to the place where he was to sacrifice his son. In the Bible it is a three-day journey and the two are accompanied by a donkey and two attendants.[37] (Genesis 22:1-4)\n  * The series shows [Sarah](/wiki/Sarah \"Sarah\") running after Abraham once she realizes he is going to sacrifice Isaac. This is not in the text.[38] (Genesis 22:1-19)\n  * In the [Binding of Isaac](/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac \"Binding of Isaac\"), the text describes a ram (adult) caught by its horns in a thicket. The miniseries depicts a juvenile lamb caught by its leg[39] (Genesis 22:13)\n  * When Moses appeared to Pharaoh years later, the text shows Moses' brother Aaron releasing his shepherd staff onto the ground which turns into a snake wherein Pharaoh's magicians copying the trick. The series omits this.\n  * The Bible text says that Samson tied torches on 300 foxes' tails causing them to burn the Phillistines' crops and plants. This was because Samson was angry with his father in law for giving his wife to another man. When they head this they burned Samson's wife and her father to death (Judges 15: 4-6). In the series the Philistine commander has Samson's wife and her father put to death as consequence for marrying Samson, who was an [Israelite](/wiki/Israelites \"Israelites\").\n  * After [David](/wiki/David \"David\")'s affair with [Bathsheba](/wiki/Bathsheba \"Bathsheba\") and the killing of [Uriah the Hittite](/wiki/Uriah_the_Hittite \"Uriah the Hittite\"), he is confronted by [Nathan](/wiki/Nathan_\\(prophet\\) \"Nathan \\(prophet\\)\"). The series depicts David as resistant or even indignant, whereas in the text, David is remorseful for his sin and admits his guilt, leading him to write [Psalm 51](/wiki/Psalm_51 \"Psalm 51\") and beg forgiveness from God[40] (2 Samuel 12:13, Psalms 51)\n  * When the [Babylonians](/wiki/Babylonia \"Babylonia\") destroy [Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\"), [Jeremiah](/wiki/Jeremiah \"Jeremiah\") is depicted as escaping unnoticed by the invaders. In the text Jeremiah is captured, bound in chains and later released[39] (Jeremiah 39:11-40:6)\n  * The show depicts [Daniel](/wiki/Daniel_\\(biblical_figure\\) \"Daniel \\(biblical figure\\)\") and his three compatriots being captured during the siege, when in fact, they were deported more than a decade before [Jerusalem’s destruction](/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_\\(587_BC\\) \"Siege of Jerusalem \\(587 BC\\)\")[39] (Daniel 1; 2 Kings 24:10-16)\n  * When [Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego](/wiki/Shadrach,_Meshach,_and_Abednego \"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego\") refuse to worship King [Nebuchadnezzar](/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar \"Nebuchadnezzar\")'s golden statue, the miniseries depicts them as being tied up, with a fire lit under them. In the text, the king orders the three to be thrown into a furnace that was heated seven times hotter than usual. In fact, the text describes the furnace as being so hot, that some of Nebuchadnezzar's \"strongest soldiers\" who threw them in there were killed by the flames while doing so.[41] (Daniel 3:19-23)\n  * The miniseries's depicts the prophet [Isaiah](/wiki/Isaiah \"Isaiah\") as a contemporary of [Daniel](/wiki/Daniel_\\(biblical_figure\\) \"Daniel \\(biblical figure\\)\"), living during the time of the Babylonian exile. This is a major inconsistency with the text as Isaiah prophesied that [Cyrus the Persian](/wiki/Cyrus_the_Persian \"Cyrus the Persian\") would release the captives after a period of time. This prophecy occurred 150 years before Cyrus was born, 180 years before Cyrus performed any of these feats, and 80 years before the Jews were taken into exile[42] meaning that Isaiah could never have existed contemporaneously—that is, at the same time—as Daniel and Cyrus. (Isaiah 44:28; 45:1; 45:13).\n  * In the miniseries' depiction of the [Temptation of Christ](/wiki/Temptation_of_Christ \"Temptation of Christ\"), the [Devil](/wiki/Devil_in_Christianity \"Devil in Christianity\") took Jesus to a high mountain when he tempted Jesus to throw himself down. In the text, the Devil tempted Jesus to throw himself down from the pinnacle of the [temple](/wiki/Second_Temple \"Second Temple\"). The high mountain was where the devil tempted Jesus to worship him.[32][39] (Matthew 4:1-11; Luke 4:1-13)\n  * In the Bible, Jesus had the mourners remove the stone, and then he called for Lazarus to come out. In the miniseries, Jesus enters Lazarus' tomb and kisses him on the head, while not even addressing Lazarus, and gives a brand-new monologue. (John 11:38-44) [43]\n  * During the [Way of The Cross](/wiki/Via_Dolorosa \"Via Dolorosa\") scene, the actual scripture depicts Jesus meeting a group of women wailing for him and admonishes them to \"not to weep for him; Rather for themselves and their children\" (Luke 23:27-31). The miniseries omits this. However, they featured a scene where a woman ([Saint Veronica](/wiki/Saint_Veronica \"Saint Veronica\")) wipes his face. This is however taken from one of the [14 Stations of the Cross](/wiki/Stations_of_the_Cross \"Stations of the Cross\") of the [Catholic Church](/wiki/Catholic_Church \"Catholic Church\").\n\n#### Lookalike\ncontroversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Bible_\\(miniseries\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Lookalike controversy\")]\n\nThere have been claims of a resemblance of the actor in the role of\n[Satan](/wiki/Satan \"Satan\") (Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni) to U.S. President\n[Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\"). The resemblance was first\npointed out notably by [Glenn Beck](/wiki/Glenn_Beck \"Glenn Beck\") ahead of\nthe episode's premiere.[44][45]\n\nThis led the History Channel to announce,\n\n> History [C]hannel has the highest respect for President Obama. The Bible\n> series was produced with an international and diverse cast of respected\n> actors. It's unfortunate that anyone made this false connection. History’s\n> \"The Bible\" is meant to enlighten people on its rich stories and deep\n> history.\"[46]\n\nBurnett and Downey responded in a joint statement,\n\n> This is utter nonsense. The actor who played Satan, Mehdi Ouazanni, is a\n> highly acclaimed Moroccan actor. He has previously played parts in several\n> Biblical epics – including Satanic characters long before Barack Obama was\n> elected as our President.[46]\n\nDowney added separately,\n\n> \"Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love for our president, who is\n> a fellow Christian. False statements such as these are just designed as a\n> foolish distraction to try and discredit the beauty of the story of The\n> Bible.[47]\n\n### Awards
