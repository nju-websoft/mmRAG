Along\nwith his collaborator [Théodore Simon](/wiki/Th%C3%A9odore_Simon \"Théodore\nSimon\"), Binet published revisions of his test in 1908 and 1911, the last of\nwhich appeared just before his death.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Biography\n    * 1.1 Education and early career\n    * 1.2 Later career and the Binet–Simon test\n    * 1.3 Binet and chess\n  * 2 Publications\n  * 3 Notes\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Biography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Binet&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Biography\")]\n\n### Education and early\ncareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Binet&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Education and early career\")]\n\nBinet attended law school in Paris, and received his degree in 1878. He also\nstudied [physiology](/wiki/Physiology \"Physiology\") at the\n[Sorbonne](/wiki/University_of_Paris \"University of Paris\"). His first formal\nposition was as a researcher at a neurological clinic, [Salpêtrière\nHospital](/wiki/Piti%C3%A9-Salp%C3%AAtri%C3%A8re_Hospital \"Pitié-Salpêtrière\nHospital\"), in Paris from 1883–1889. From there, Binet went on to being a\nresearcher and associate director of the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology\nat the Sorbonne from 1891–1894. In 1894, he was promoted to being the director\nof the laboratory until 1911 (his death). Binet also educated himself by\nreading psychology texts at the National Library in Paris. He soon became\nfascinated with the ideas of [John Stuart Mill](/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill \"John\nStuart Mill\"), who believed that the operations of intelligence could be\nexplained by the laws of associationism. Binet eventually realized the\nlimitations of this theory, but Mill's ideas continued to influence his work.\n\nIn 1883, years of unaccompanied study ended when Binet was introduced to\n[Charles Féré](/wiki/Charles_F%C3%A9r%C3%A9 \"Charles Féré\"), who introduced\nhim to [Jean-Martin Charcot](/wiki/Jean-Martin_Charcot \"Jean-Martin Charcot\"),\nthe director of a clinic called La Salpêtrière, Paris. Charcot became his\nmentor and in turn, Binet accepted a job offer at the clinic, working in his\nneurological laboratory. At the time of Binet's tenure, Charcot was\nexperimenting with [hypnotism](/wiki/Hypnotism \"Hypnotism\"). Binet was\nstrongly influenced by Charcot, and published four articles about his work in\nthis area. Unfortunately, Charcot's conclusions did not hold up under\nprofessional scrutiny, and Binet was forced to make an embarrassing public\nadmission that he had been wrong in supporting his teacher. Nevertheless, he\nhad established his name internationally in the field, [Morton\nPrince](/wiki/Morton_Prince \"Morton Prince\") for example stating in 1904 that\n\"certain problems in subconscious automatism will always be associated with\nthe names of [Breuer](/wiki/Josef_Breuer \"Josef Breuer\") and\n[Freud](/wiki/Sigmund_Freud \"Sigmund Freud\") in Germany,\n[Janet](/wiki/Pierre_Janet \"Pierre Janet\") and Alfred Binet in France\".[3]\n\nWhen his involvement with hypnosis waned as a result of failure to establish\nprofessional acceptance, he turned to the study of development spurred on by\nthe birth of his two daughters, Marguerite and Armande (born in 1885 and 1887,\nrespectively), calling Armande a subjectivist and Marguerite an objectivist,\nand developing the concepts of _introspection_ and _externospection_ in an\nanticipation of [Carl Jung](/wiki/Carl_Jung \"Carl Jung\")'s psychological\ntypes.[4] In the 21-year period following his shift in career interests, Binet\n\"published more than 200 books, articles, and reviews in what now would be\ncalled experimental, developmental, educational, social, and differential\npsychology\" (Siegler, 1992). Bergin and Cizek (2001) suggest that this work\nmay have influenced [Jean Piaget](/wiki/Jean_Piaget \"Jean Piaget\"), who later\nstudied with Binet's collaborator [Théodore Simon](/wiki/Th%C3%A9odore_Simon\n\"Théodore Simon\") in 1920. Binet's research with his daughters helped him to\nfurther refine his developing conception of intelligence, especially the\nimportance of attention span and suggestibility in intellectual development.\n\nDespite Binet's extensive research interests and wide breadth of publications,\ntoday he is most widely known for his contributions to\n[intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\"). Wolf (1973) postulates that\nthis is the result of his not being affiliated with a major university.\nBecause Binet did not have any formalized graduate study in psychology, he did\nnot hold a professorship with a prestigious institution where students and\nfunds would be sure to perpetuate his work (Siegler, 1992). Additionally, his\nmore progressive theories did not provide the practical utility that his\nintelligence scale would evoke.\n\nBinet and his coworker Fere discovered what they called transfer and they also\nrecognized perceptual and emotional polarization. Binet and Fere thought their\nfindings were a [phenomenon](/wiki/Phenomenon \"Phenomenon\") and of utmost\nimportance. After investigations by many, the two men were forced to admit\nthat they were wrong about their concepts of transfer and polarization.\nBasically, their patients had known what was expected, what was supposed to\nhappen, and so they simply assented. Binet had risked everything on his\nexperiment and its results, and this failure took a toll on him.\n\nIn 1890, Binet resigned from La Salpêtrière and never mentioned the place or\nits director again. His interests then turned towards the development of his\nchildren, Madeleine and Alice, who were two years apart. This research\npresages that done by [Jean Piaget](/wiki/Jean_Piaget \"Jean Piaget\") just a\nshort time later, regarding the development of cognition in children.\n\nA job presented itself for Binet in 1891 at the Laboratory of Physiological\nPsychology at the [Sorbonne](/wiki/University_of_Paris \"University of Paris\").\nHe worked for a year without pay and by 1894, he took over as the director.\nThis was a position that Binet held until his death, and it enabled him to\npursue his studies on mental processes. While directing the Laboratory,\nTheodore Simon applied to do doctoral research under Binet's supervision. This\nwas the beginning of their long, fruitful collaboration. During this time he\nalso co-founded the French journal of psychology, _L 'Annee psychologique_,\nserving as the director and editor-in-chief of the journal that was the first\nscientific journal in this domain.\n\n### Later career and the Binet–Simon\ntest[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Binet&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Later career and the Binet–Simon test\")]\n\nIn 1899, Binet was asked to be a member of the Free Society for the\nPsychological Study of the Child. French education changed greatly during the\nend of the nineteenth century, because of a law that passed which made it\nmandatory for children ages six to fourteen to attend school. This group to\nwhich Binet became a member hoped to begin studying children in a scientific\nmanner. Binet and many other members of the society were appointed to the\nCommission for the Retarded. The question became \"What should be the test\ngiven to children thought to possibly have learning disabilities, that might\nplace them in a special classroom?\" Binet made it his problem to establish the\ndifferences that separate the normal child from the abnormal, and to measure\nsuch differences. _L 'Etude experimentale de l'intelligence_ (Experimental\nStudies of Intelligence) was the book he used to describe his methods and it\nwas published in 1903.\n\nDevelopment of more tests and investigations began soon after the book, with\nthe help of a young medical student named [Theodore\nSimon](/wiki/Theodore_Simon \"Theodore Simon\"). Simon had nominated himself a\nfew years before as Binet's research assistant and worked with him on the\nintelligence tests that Binet is known for, which share Simon's name as well.\nIn 1905, a new test for measuring intelligence was introduced and simply\ncalled the Binet–Simon scale. In 1908, they revised the scale, dropping,\nmodifying, and adding tests and also arranging them according to age levels\nfrom three to thirteen.\n\nIn 1904 a French professional group for child psychology, La Société Libre\npour l'Etude Psychologique de l'Enfant, was called upon by the French\ngovernment to appoint a commission on the education of retarded children. The\ncommission was asked to create a mechanism for identifying students in need of\nalternative education. Binet, being an active member of this group, found the\nimpetus for the development of his mental scale.\n\nBinet and Simon, in creating what historically is known as the Binet-Simon\nScale, comprised a variety of tasks they thought were representative of\ntypical children's abilities at various ages. This task-selection process was\nbased on their many years of observing children in natural settings. They then\ntested their measurement on a sample of fifty children, ten children per five\nage groups. The children selected for their study were identified by their\nschool teachers as being average for their age. The purpose of this scale of\nnormal functioning, which would later be revised twice using more stringent\nstandards, was to compare children's mental abilities relative to those of\ntheir normal peers (Siegler, 1992).\n\nThe scale consisted of thirty tasks of increasing difficulty. The easier ones\ncould be done by everyone. Some of the simplest test items assessed whether or\nnot a child could follow a beam of light or talk back to the examiner.\nSlightly harder tasks required children to point to various named body parts,\nrepeat back a series of 2 digits, repeat simple sentences, and define words\nlike house, fork or mama. More difficult test items required children to state\nthe difference between pairs of things, reproduce drawings from memory or to\nconstruct sentences from three given words such as \"Paris, river and fortune.\"\nThe hardest test items included asking children to repeat back 7 random\ndigits, find three rhymes for the French word \"obéisance\" and to answer\nquestions such as \"My neighbor has been receiving strange visitors. He has\nreceived in turn a doctor, a lawyer, and then a priest. What is taking place?\"\n(Fancher, 1985).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Simon-\nBinet_Ugly_Face_Item_from_1911_journal.png/220px-Simon-\nBinet_Ugly_Face_Item_from_1911_journal.png)](/wiki/File:Simon-\nBinet_Ugly_Face_Item_from_1911_journal.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Simon-Binet_Ugly_Face_Item_from_1911_journal.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nReproduction of an item from the 1908 Binet-Simon intelligence scale, showing\nthree pairs of pictures, about which the tested child was asked, \"Which of\nthese two faces is the prettier?\" Reproduced from the article \"A Practical\nGuide for Administering the Binet-Simon Scale for Measuring Intelligence\" by\nJ. W. Wallace Wallin in the March 1911 issue of the journal _The Psychological\nClinic_ (volume 5 number 1), public domain.\n\nFor the practical use of determining educational placement, the score on the\nBinet-Simon scale would reveal the child's [mental age](/wiki/Mental_age\n\"Mental age\"). For example, a 6-year-old child who passed all the tasks\nusually passed by 6 year-olds—but nothing beyond—would have a mental age that\nexactly matched his chronological age, 6.0. (Fancher, 1985).\n\nBinet was forthright about the limitations of his scale. He stressed the\nremarkable diversity of intelligence and the subsequent need to study it using\nqualitative, as opposed to quantitative, measures. Binet also stressed that\nintellectual development progressed at variable rates and could be influenced\nby the environment; therefore, intelligence was not based solely on genetics,\nwas malleable rather than fixed, and could only be found in children with\ncomparable backgrounds (Siegler, 1992). Given Binet's stance that intelligence\ntesting was subject to variability and was not generalizable, it is important\nto look at the metamorphosis that mental testing took on as it made its way to\nthe U.S.\n\nWhile Binet was developing his mental scale, the business, civic, and\neducational leaders in the U.S. were facing issues of how to accommodate the\nneeds of a diversifying population, while continuing to meet the demands of\nsociety. There arose the call to form a society based on\n[meritocracy](/wiki/Meritocracy \"Meritocracy\") (Siegler,1992) while continuing\nto underline the ideals of the upper class. In 1908, [H.H.\nGoddard](/wiki/Henry_H._Goddard \"Henry H. Goddard\"), a champion of the\neugenics movement, found utility in mental testing as a way to evidence the\nsuperiority of the white race. After studying abroad, Goddard brought the\nBinet-Simon Scale to the United States and translated it into English.\n\nFollowing Goddard in the U.S. mental testing movement was [Lewis\nTerman](/wiki/Lewis_Terman \"Lewis Terman\"), who took the Simon-Binet Scale and\nstandardized it using a large American sample. The new [Stanford-Binet\nscale](/wiki/Stanford%E2%80%93Binet_Intelligence_Scales \"Stanford–Binet\nIntelligence Scales\") was no longer used solely for advocating education for\nall children, as was Binet's objective. A new objective of intelligence\ntesting was illustrated in the Stanford-Binet manual with testing ultimately\nresulting in \"curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness and in the\nelimination of an enormous amount of crime, pauperism, and industrial\ninefficiency\".[5]\n\nIt follows that we should question why Binet did not speak out concerning the\nnewfound uses of his measure. Siegler (1992) pointed out that Binet was\nsomewhat of an isolationist in that he never traveled outside France and he\nbarely participated in professional organizations. Additionally, his mental\nscale was not adopted in his own country during his lifetime and therefore was\nnot subjected to the same fate. Finally, when Binet did become aware of the\n\"foreign ideas being grafted on his instrument\" he condemned those who with\n'brutal pessimism' and 'deplorable verdicts' were promoting the concept of\nintelligence as a single, unitary construct (White, 2000).\n\nHe did a lot of studies of children. His experimental subjects ranged from 3\nto 18 years old. Binet published the third version of the Binet-Simon scale\nshortly before his death in 1911. The Binet-Simon scale was and is hugely\npopular around the world, mainly because of the vast literature it has\nfostered, as well as its relative ease of administration.\n\nSince his death, many people in many ways have honored Binet, but two of these\nstand out. In 1917, the Free Society for the Psychological Study of the Child,\nof which Binet became a member in 1899 and which prompted his development of\nthe intelligence tests, changed their name to La Société Alfred Binet, in\nmemory of the renowned psychologist. The second honor was not until 1984, when\nthe journal _Science_ 84 picked the Binet-Simon scale as one of twenty of the\ncentury's most significant developments or discoveries.\n\nHe studied sexual behavior, coining the term [erotic\nfetishism](/wiki/Sexual_fetishism \"Sexual fetishism\") to describe individuals\nwhose sexual interests in nonhuman objects, such as articles of clothing,[6]\nand linking this to the after-effects of early impressions in an anticipation\nof Freud.[7]\n\nHe also studied abilities of [Valentine Dencausse](/wiki/Valentine_Dencausse\n\"Valentine Dencausse\"), the most famous [chiromancer](/wiki/Chiromancer\n\"Chiromancer\") in Paris in those days.\n\n### Binet and\nchess[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Binet&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Binet and chess\")]\n\nBinet had done a series of experiments to see how well [chess](/wiki/Chess\n\"Chess\") players played when blindfolded.[8] He found that only some of the\nmaster chess players could play from memory and a few could play multiple\ngames simultaneously without looking at the boards. To remember the positions\nof the pieces on the boards, some players envisioned exact replicas of\nspecific chess sets, while others envisioned an abstract schema of the game.\nBinet concluded that extraordinary feats of memory such as blind chess playing\ncould take a variety of mnemonic forms. He recounted his experiments in a book\nentitled _Psychologie des grands calculateurs et joueurs en echec_ (Paris:\nHachette, 1894).[9]\n\n## Publications[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Binet&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Publications\")]\n\n  * _[La psychologie du raisonnement; Recherches expérimentales par l'hypnotisme](https://archive.org/details/lapsychologiedur00bine)_ (Paris, Alcan, 1886; English translation, 1899).
