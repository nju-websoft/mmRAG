        "# The Twelve Spies\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Tissot_The_Grapes_of_Canaan.jpg/240px-\nTissot_The_Grapes_of_Canaan.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tissot_The_Grapes_of_Canaan.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tissot_The_Grapes_of_Canaan.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_The Grapes of Canaan_ by [James Tissot](/wiki/James_Tissot \"James Tissot\").\nAlthough the spies brought back a cluster of grapes so large that it took two\nmen to carry it (Numbers 13:23), only two of the twelve brought back a good\nreport of the land.\n\n**The Twelve Spies** (Hebrew: שנים עשר המרגלים), as recorded in the [Book of\nNumbers](/wiki/Book_of_Numbers \"Book of Numbers\"), were a group of\n[Israelite](/wiki/Israelites \"Israelites\") chieftains, one from each of the\n[Twelve Tribes](/wiki/Israelites#Biblical_Israel \"Israelites\"), who were\ndispatched by [Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\") to scout out the Land of\n[Canaan](/wiki/Canaan \"Canaan\") for 40 days[1] as a future home for the\nIsraelite people, during the time when the Israelites were in the wilderness\nfollowing their [Exodus](/wiki/The_Exodus \"The Exodus\") from [Ancient\nEgypt](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt \"Ancient Egypt\"). The account is found in [Numbers\n13:1-33](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0413.htm#1).\n\nGod had promised [Abraham](/wiki/Abraham \"Abraham\") that there would be a\n[Promised Land](/wiki/Promised_Land \"Promised Land\") for the nations to come\nout of his son, [Isaac](/wiki/Isaac \"Isaac\"). The land of Canaan which the\nspies were to explore was the same Promised Land. Moses asked for an\nassessment of the geographical features of the land, the strength and numbers\nof the population, the agricultural potential and actual performance of the\nland, civic organization (whether their cities were like camps or\nstrongholds), and [forestry](/wiki/Forestry \"Forestry\") conditions. He also\nasked them to be positive in their outlook and to return with samples of local\nproduce.\n\nWhen ten of the twelve spies showed little faith in the doom and gloom report\nthey gave about the land, they were slandering what they believed God had\npromised them. They did not believe that God could help them, and the people\nas a whole were persuaded that it was not possible to take the land. As a\nresult, the entire nation was made to wander in the desert for 40 years, until\nalmost the entire generation of men had died.[2] [Joshua](/wiki/Joshua\n\"Joshua\") and [Caleb](/wiki/Caleb \"Caleb\") were the two spies who brought back\na good report and believed that God would help them succeed. They were the\nonly men from their generation permitted to go into the Promised Land after\nthe time of wandering.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 About the spies\n  * 2 Consequences\n  * 3 Tisha B'Av\n  * 4 References\n\n## About the\nspies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Twelve_Spies&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: About the spies\")]\n\nGod had promised the Israelites that they would be able to conquer the land\nwith its indigenous Canaanite nations. [Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\") instructed\nthe spies to report back on the agriculture and lay of the land. However,\nduring their tour, the spies saw fortified cities and resident giants, which\nfrightened them and led them to believe that the Israelites would not be able\nto conquer the land as God had promised. Ten of the spies decided to bring\nback an unbalanced report, emphasizing the difficulty of the task before\nthem.[4]\n\n> They gave Moses this account, \"We went into the land to which you sent us,\n> and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit. But the people who\n> live there are very powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large.\n> We even saw descendants of [Anak](/wiki/Anak \"Anak\") there.\"\n>\n> — Numbers, 13:27-28\n\nTwo of the spies — Joshua and Caleb — did not go along with the majority and\ntried to convince the Israelites that they could conquer the land:\n\n> Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, \"We should go up and\n> take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.\"\n>\n> — Numbers, 13:30\n\nHowever, the Israelite community believed the majority's conclusions. All of\nthe spies, except Joshua and Caleb, were struck down with a plague and\ndied.[5]\n\n[Joshua](/wiki/Joshua \"Joshua\") was at first a fierce warrior. He was chosen\nas the representative from his tribe, [Ephraim](/wiki/Tribe_of_Ephraim \"Tribe\nof Ephraim\"), to explore the land of Canaan, and was in agreement with Caleb\nthat the Promised Land could be conquered. After the incident with the 12\nspies, Joshua lived through the 40 year wandering period, and was named\nsuccessor to Moses as instructed by God. Joshua completed the task of leading\nthe Israelites into the Promised Land and of taking possession of it. Joshua\nalso was the leader in renewing the Mosaic covenant with their God.[6]\n\n[Caleb](/wiki/Caleb \"Caleb\") was from the tribe of Judah. He was also chosen\nto explore the land of Canaan, and he was (along with Joshua) the other man\nwho said that the God of Israel could help the Israelite people to victory\nagainst the Canaanites. God promised Caleb and Joshua that they would receive\nthe land which they had explored for themselves and their descendants. Caleb\nwas also told that he would live to go into the Promised Land.[7]\n\nThe names of the twelve spies were:[8]\n\n  1. Shammua son of Zaccur, from the tribe of Reuben\n  2. Shaphat son of Hori, from the tribe of Simeon\n  3. Caleb son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah\n  4. Igal son of Joseph, from the tribe of Issachar\n  5. Hoshea (Joshua) son of Nun, from the tribe of Ephraim\n  6. Palti son of Raphu, from the tribe of Benjamin\n  7. Gaddiel son of Sodi, from the tribe of Zebulin\n  8. Gaddi son of Susi, from the tribe of Manasseh\n  9. Ammiel son of Gemalli, from the tribe of Dan\n  10. Sethur son of Michael, from the tribe of Asher\n  11. Nahbi son of Vophsi, from the tribe of Naphtali\n  12. Geuel son of Maki, from the tribe of Gad\n\nSome people think the word \"spies\" is an incorrect translation. The Hebrew\nword that the Torah uses is מרגלים (\"meraglim\"), which can also mean\n\"traitors\" or \"deserters\". In [Numbers 13:](http://www.mechon-\nmamre.org/p/pt/pt0413.htm#), the Hebrew word describing the group is also the\nword usually translated as \"men\" or the word usually translated as \"princes\".\nIn addition, the twelve were clearly not trained as spies, nor did they\nconduct any covert activity, nor did they enlist any indigenous people for\nlater help. Thus, the phrase \"Twelve Scouts\" or \"Twelve Observers\" might be an\nalternative way of describing the group. However, the final point remains that\ntheir \"report\" resulted in a great outcry and the Israelites despaired of\nentering the promised land and were punished by God accordingly, as outlined\nabove.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\n##\nConsequences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Twelve_Spies&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Consequences\")]\n\nThe Israelites' belief of the false report amounted to the acceptance of\n[lashon hara](/wiki/Lashon_hara \"Lashon hara\") (lit.\" \"evil tongue\" /\n\"slander\" in Hebrew) against the [Land of Israel](/wiki/Land_of_Israel \"Land\nof Israel\").\n\n> But the men who had gone up with him said, \"We can't attack those people;\n> they are stronger than we are.\" And they spread a bad report about the land\n> they had explored. They said, \"The land we explored devours those living in\n> it. All the people we saw there were of great size. We saw the Nephilim\n> there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like\n> grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.\"\n>\n> — Numbers, 13:31-33\n\nThis was considered a grave sin by God. Corresponding to the 40 days that the\nspies toured the land, God decreed that the Israelites would wander in the\nwilderness for 40 years as a result of their unwillingness to take the land.\nMoreover, the entire generation of men who left [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt \"Egypt\")\nduring the [Exodus](/wiki/The_Exodus \"The Exodus\") would die in the desert,\nsave for Joshua and Caleb who did not slander the land.[2]\n\nFor 40 years, the Israelites wandered in the wilderness, eating\n[quail](/wiki/Quail \"Quail\") and [manna](/wiki/Manna \"Manna\"). They were led\ninto the Promised Land by Joshua; the [victory at\nJericho](/wiki/Battle_of_Jericho \"Battle of Jericho\") marked the beginning of\npossession of the land. As victories were won, the tracts of land were\nassigned to each tribe, and they lived peacefully with each other. God brought\nvictories where needed, and his promise to Abraham was fulfilled.\n\n## Tisha B'Av[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Twelve_Spies&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Tisha B'Av\")]\n\nAccording to Rabbinic tradition (as seen in the [Mishnah\nTaanit](/wiki/Ta%27anit \"Ta'anit\") 4:6), the sin of the spies produced the\nannual fast day of [Tisha B'Av](/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av \"Tisha B'Av\"). When the\nIsraelites accepted the false report, they wept over the false belief that God\nwas setting them up for defeat. The night that the people cried was the ninth\nof [Av](/wiki/Av \"Av\"), which became a day of weeping and misfortune for all\ntime.[9]\n\n[Rashi](/wiki/Rashi \"Rashi\"), commenting on [Numbers 13:25](http://www.mechon-\nmamre.org/p/pt/pt0413.htm#25), notes that the journey was shortened by God, as\nGod foresaw their downfall and subsequent proportionate punishment (1 day\nequaling 1 year).[10]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Twelve_Spies&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | Wikimedia Commons has media related to _**[Israelites carrying grapes of Canaan](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Israelites_carrying_grapes_of_Canaan \"commons:Category:Israelites carrying grapes of Canaan\")**_.  \n---|---  \n  \n  1. **Jump up ^** Numbers 14:34\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Numbers 14:30; Dummelow, J.R.
