It introduced its sweepstakes in 1967. In the early\n1990s, the company was the subject of concerns and [legal\nactions](/wiki/Legal_action \"Legal action\") regarding whether consumers were\nmisled about their odds of winning the sweepstakes and whether purchases\nincreased their chances. By 2010, the company had reached\n[settlements](/wiki/Settlement_\\(litigation\\) \"Settlement \\(litigation\\)\")\nwith all 50 states.\n\nThe company acquired search company Blingo in 2006,[3] online gaming company\nFuntank in 2010, and [mobile marketing](/wiki/Mobile_marketing \"Mobile\nmarketing\") company Liquid Wireless in 2012.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Early history\n    * 1.2 Government regulation\n      * 1.2.1 Lawsuits\n    * 1.3 Online development\n  * 2 Products\n  * 3 Sweepstakes\n    * 3.1 Odds of Winning\n    * 3.2 Prize Patrol\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### Early\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Early history\")]\n\nPublishers Clearing House was founded in 1953 in [Port Washington, New\nYork](/wiki/Port_Washington,_New_York \"Port Washington, New York\"), by Harold\nMertz,[4][5] a former manager of a door-to-door sales team for magazine\nsubscriptions.[6] The company started in Mertz's basement with help from his\nwife [LuEsther](/wiki/LuEsther_Mertz \"LuEsther Mertz\") and daughter\nJoyce.[7][8] Its first mailings were of 10,000 envelopes from Mertz's home in\nLong Island, New York, and offered 20 magazine subscriptions. 100 orders were\nreceived. Within a few years the company moved out of Mertz's basement into an\noffice building and started hiring staff. When PCH moved its headquarters in\n1969, its prior location was donated to the city and renamed the Harold E.\nMertz community center.[8] The company revenue had grown to [US$](/wiki/US$\n\"US$\")50 million by 1981, and $100 million by 1988.[6]\n\nIn 1967 PCH started its first sweepstakes as a way to increase subscription\nsales,[9] based on the sweepstakes held by _[Reader's\nDigest](/wiki/Reader%27s_Digest \"Reader's Digest\")_.[4] The first prizes\nranged from 25 cents to $10 and entrants had a 1 in 10 chance of winning.\nAfter the sweepstakes increased response rates to mailings, prizes of[8]\n$5,000[6] and eventually $250,000 were offered.[10] PCH began advertising the\nsweepstakes on TV in 1974.[7][11] It was the only major multi-magazine\nsubscription business until 1977. Former client [Time Inc.](/wiki/Time_Inc.\n\"Time Inc.\") and several other publishers formed [American Family\nPublishers](/wiki/American_Family_Publishers \"American Family Publishers\")\n(AFP) to compete with PCH after the company refused repeated requests by Time\nfor a larger share of sales revenue from magazine subscriptions.[4][8]\n\nAFP and PCH competed for exclusive rights to magazines and for the better\npromotion and prize ideas. When AFP increased their jackpot to $1 million,[10]\nthen to $10 million in 1985, PCH raised its prizes to match.[4] $7 million in\nprizes were distributed by 1979,[12] $40 million by 1991[5] and $137 million\nby 2000.[9] In 1989 two members of its advertising team, Dave Sayer and Todd\nSloane, started the Prize Patrol, a publicized event where winners are\nsurprised with a check at their home. The idea was inspired by the 1950s\ntelevision series \"[The Millionaire](/wiki/The_Millionaire_\\(TV_series\\) \"The\nMillionaire \\(TV series\\)\")\".[4][13][14]\n\nIn 1992 thousands of discarded sweepstakes entries from contestants who had\nnot bought magazine subscriptions were found in the trash by city\nemployees,[4][15] reinforcing beliefs that the company favored those who made\npurchases in selecting a sweepstakes winner.[4] PCH said this was done by a\ndisgruntled employee at their mail processing vendor.[8] A [class\naction](/wiki/Class_action \"Class action\") ensued, which PCH settled by giving\ndiscarded entrants a second chance to win.[4][15][16]\n\n### Government\nregulation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Government regulation\")]\n\nIn the 1990s PCH and its primary competitor, AFP, experienced a series of\nlegal troubles due to concerns that their mailings misled consumers about\ntheir odds of winning and implied that magazine purchases increased their\nchances.[4][10] This led to the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act\nof 2000, which regulates direct mail businesses.[4] At the senate hearings\nregarding this Act, PCH said most consumers were not confused about their\nchances of winning or that purchases did not increase their chances. The\ncompany said less than five percent of participants spend more than $300.[8]\nGovernment officials from California said 5,000 local consumers paid more than\n$2,500 each in magazine purchases under the false belief that they were\nincreasing their odds of winning the sweepstakes.[17]\n\nIndustry sources estimated PCH's response rates decreased by 7-12 percent and\nits sales volume by 22 to 30 percent in response to the bad publicity from the\nlawsuits.[6][18] In 2000, PCH laid off a quarter of its 800-person work\nforce.[18]\n\n####\nLawsuits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Lawsuits\")]\n\nIn 1994 PCH sent mailings telling recipients they were all \"finalists\", which\nled to[10] a lawsuit involving the attorneys general of 14 US\nstates.[19][20][21] Later that year, PCH denied wrongdoing, but agreed to pay\na settlement of $490,000 and to change their practices.[20] Under the\nagreement, PCH said it would define terms like \"finalist\" and disclose the\nchances of winning.[22]\n\nIn 1997, a contestant of competitor AFP flew to [Tampa,\nFlorida](/wiki/Tampa,_Florida \"Tampa, Florida\"), thinking he had won, though\nhe had not. The resulting publicity caused more lawsuits for both\ncompanies.[6] PCH reached a $30 million national settlement in 1999.[8][23] In\n2000, another $18 million settlement was reached with 24 states, after the\ncompany sent mass mailings that said \"You are a winner!\" and used mock\npersonalized checks.[17][24] PCH agreed to avoid similar mailings in the\nfuture, and add a \"sweepstakes fact box\" to mailings.[17][24]\n\nState attorneys spoke out against the national settlement from 2000 and\nadditional lawsuits were filed by individual states.[8] Another $34 million\nsettlement was reached in 2001 in a lawsuit involving 25 states.[1][25] As\npart of the settlement, PCH was required to avoid terms like \"Guaranteed\nWinner,\" add disclaimers to mailings saying that the recipient has not won and\nthat purchasing merchandise won't increase their chances.[26][25][27] PCH\nreached settlements with all fifty states and agreed to work with a\n\"compliance counsel.\"[6] PCH apologized in the settlement and said it would\ncontact customers who had spent more than $1,000 on merchandise the prior\nyear\".[27]\n\nPCH also reached an agreement with Iowa in 2007.[28] In 2010 the company paid\n$3.5 million to the Attorneys General of 32 states and the District of\nColumbia to settle possible contempt charges that it had violated the terms of\nthe 2001 agreement. The company denied wrongdoing, but agreed to work with\nboth an ombudsperson and a compliance counsel who would review its mailings\nquarterly.[29][30][31][32]\n\nIn April 2014, an investigation by the Senate Special Committee on Aging\nconcluded that PCH had \"pushed the limits\" of prior agreements and that\nadditional legislation may be needed.[33]\n\n### Online\ndevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Online development\")]\n\nPCH began selling merchandise in 1985[7] with two products. After a\n[Hershey's](/wiki/The_Hershey_Company \"The Hershey Company\") Chocolate\nCookbook and a diet cookbook sold more than other products, the company began\nexpanding into jewelry, media, collectibles, household products and others.[8]\nThe company also shifted its focus online.[1][34] It began selling magazine\nsubscriptions and merchandise on PCH.com in 1996.[35] In 2006, it acquired\nBlingo Inc., an ad-supported [metasearch engine](/wiki/Metasearch_engine\n\"Metasearch engine\") that was later re-branded as PCH Search and Win.[13][36]\nPCH ran contests on Twitter, Facebook and Myspace. iPhone apps for slot games\nand trivia were developed. The company created online play-and-win sites like\n[PCH Games](/wiki/PCH_Games \"PCH Games\") (formerly Candystand) and\nPCHQuiz4Cash, with air-hockey and video poker games.[1]\n\nIn December 2010, PCH acquired Funtank and its online gaming site\nCandystand.com.[37] In 2011, PCH promoted a \"$5,000 every week for life\"\nsweepstakes in TV ads and the front page of AOL.com.[11][26] The following\nyear the company acquired a mobile marketing company, Liquid Wireless.[38] The\ncompany utilized, then stopped then started again utilizing coregistration\n(through other websites) to expand its customer base.[39]\n\nIn 2008, a PCH spokesperson said the digital properties were intended to\nattract younger consumers. By 2013, the internet had become PCH's primary\nchannel of interaction with consumers.[7] _The New York Times_ described the\ndigital transition as \"part of an overall effort to collect information on Web\nusers, show them advertisements and use the registration information for PCH’s\nmailing lists.\"[1]\n\n##\nProducts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Products\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Screenshot_of_PCH_Search_and_Win.png/220px-\nScreenshot_of_PCH_Search_and_Win.png)](/wiki/File:Screenshot_of_PCH_Search_and_Win.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Screenshot_of_PCH_Search_and_Win.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA screenshot of PCHSearch&WIN.com\n\nPCH is a direct-marketing company that sells merchandise, magazine\nsubscriptions and operates several prize-based websites.[11] While best known\nfor the sweepstakes and Prize Patrol it uses to promote its magazine\nsubscriptions,[1][13][35] the majority of the company's revenue now comes from\nmerchandise.[11] The company has been selling books, media, jewelry and other\nconsumer items[4] since the 1980s.[8] PCH operates eight websites, including\nPCH Search and Win, PCH Lotto, PCH Games, PCH Save and Win, and\nCandystand.[1][11]\n\nThe company also sells magazine subscriptions at a discount and advertises\nsubscriptions along with its sweepstakes.[40] It's estimated that companies\nlike PCH keep 75-90 percent of the fees from the original subscription, while\npublishers use the increased distribution to improve circulation numbers and\nrevenue from renewals.[10][41] PCH popularized the idea of using sweepstakes\nto sell magazine subscriptions in the direct-marketing market and became known\nby detractors as a producer of junk-mail for advertising through mass-\nmailings.[5][40] Documents filed with the New York State Department in 1993\nsaid that year the company mailed 220 million envelopes. Frequent buyers can\nreceive 30-40 mailings a year.[42]\n\n##\nSweepstakes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Sweepstakes\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Publishers_Clearing_House_Prize_Patrol_awards_5000_A_Wk_For_Life.JPG/220px-\nPublishers_Clearing_House_Prize_Patrol_awards_5000_A_Wk_For_Life.JPG)](/wiki/File:Publishers_Clearing_House_Prize_Patrol_awards_5000_A_Wk_For_Life.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Publishers_Clearing_House_Prize_Patrol_awards_5000_A_Wk_For_Life.JPG\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Prize Patrol delivering an oversized check to a sweepstakes winner for $1\nmillion plus $5,000 a week for life\n\nAlthough PCH advertises its sweepstakes along with magazine subscriptions, no\npurchase is necessary to enter or win.[10][42][43] In 1995, PCH began the\ntradition of announcing winners of its $10 million prize just after the [Super\nBowl](/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\").[44] As of 2012, $225 million in prizes\nhave been distributed.[8] Some of its larger prizes are for $5,000 a week for\nlife,[45] or $10 million.[46] Prizes can also range from $1 Amazon gift cards\nto $2,500, $1 million or $3 million.[47] The larger cash prizes are paid in\ninstallments, typically with a balloon payment at 30 years,[48] reducing the\npresent value of prizes to much less than their nominal values.\n\nSweepstakes scammers often pose as being from Publishers Clearing House and\nsay that a cash payment is needed before they can deliver a prize.[49]\nAccording to Chris Irving from PCH \"If you are contacted by anyone claiming to\nrepresent Publishers Clearing House and they request payment of any amount to\ncollect a prize, do not send any money... You have not heard from the real\nPublishers Clearing House.\"[50][51]\n\n### Odds of\nWinning[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Odds of Winning\")]\n\nThe odds of winning a PCH sweepstakes vary depending on the number of entries\nand what prize or sweepstakes is involved.[47] According to the official\nrules, the estimated odds of winning the $1 million a year forever are one in\n1.3 billion.[52] As of 2017, the odds of winning $15 million in Giveaway 8800\nare 1 in 2.4 billion.[53] Smaller prizes have better odds that may vary from\none in 223 to one in 80,000, depending on the prize.[47]\n\n### Prize\nPatrol[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Prize Patrol\")]\n\nThe Prize Patrol surprises sweepstakes winners at their homes, work or other\nlocations with cash prizes and captures the event on video.[7] Since their\nintroduction in 1989, these reality TV-style videos of prize-winners surprised\nat their doorstep with checks for $1,000 to $10 million have been used in\nwidely broadcast television commercials, and, more recently, in the company's\nonline acquisition efforts, websites and social media\ncommunications.[7][11][26][54] In 2013, a $5 million television campaign\nmodified the traditional prize patrol commercial by digitally altering video\nfrom classic sitcoms like _[The Brady Bunch](/wiki/The_Brady_Bunch \"The Brady\nBunch\")_ and _[Gilligan's Island](/wiki/Gilligan%27s_Island \"Gilligan's\nIsland\")_ to show the prize patrol visiting characters in the show.[54]\n\nThe Prize Patrol has made in-person appearances or delivered prizes on TV\nprograms such as _[The Oprah Winfrey Show](/wiki/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show \"The\nOprah Winfrey Show\")_[55] and _[The Price Is\nRight](/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right_\\(U.S._game_show\\) \"The Price Is Right \\(U.S.\ngame show\\)\")_.[56][57] Their surprise winning moments have been spoofed by\n[Jay Leno](/wiki/Jay_Leno \"Jay Leno\"),[58] [Conan\nO'Brien](/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien \"Conan O'Brien\")[59] and the cast of _[Saturday\nNight Live](/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live \"Saturday Night Live\")_ ;[60] woven into\nthe plots of movies such as _[Let's Go to Prison](/wiki/Let%27s_Go_to_Prison\n\"Let's Go to Prison\")_,[61][62] [_The\nSentinel_](/wiki/The_Sentinel_\\(1977_film\\) \"The Sentinel \\(1977 film\\)\")[63]\nand _[Knight and Day](/wiki/Knight_and_Day \"Knight and Day\")_ ;[64][65] and\nthe subject of [cartoon](/wiki/Cartoon \"Cartoon\")s.[8]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Industry5.svg/28px-Industry5.svg.png)[Companies portal](/wiki/Portal:Companies \"Portal:Companies\")\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Flag_of_New_York.svg/32px-Flag_of_New_York.svg.png)[New York portal](/wiki/Portal:New_York \"Portal:New York\")\n\n  * [List of New York companies](/wiki/List_of_New_York_companies \"List of New York companies\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Publishers_Clearing_House&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ Clifford, Stephanie (23 December 2008).
