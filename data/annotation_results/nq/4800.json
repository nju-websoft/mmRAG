With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th\ncentury, the familiar symbol of the heart representing love developed in the\n15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.[1] Before the 14th\ncentury, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart\nmetaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in\nsuch instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples\nfrom antiquity [fig](/wiki/Common_fig \"Common fig\") leaves, and in medieval\niconography and heraldry typically the leaves of ivy and of the water-lily.\n\nThe first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the\n1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of\nthe French _[Roman de la poire](/wiki/Roman_de_la_poire \"Roman de la poire\")_\n(National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover\n(or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or _douz regart_)\noffers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held\n\"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical\ndescriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only\nthe result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape\noutline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the\nFrench title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into\n\"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear;\nthe conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore\ndiffer over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic\nlove.[2] [Giotto](/wiki/Giotto \"Giotto\") in his 1305 painting in the\n[Scrovegni Chapel](/wiki/Scrovegni_Chapel \"Scrovegni Chapel\")\n([Padua](/wiki/Padua \"Padua\")) shows an [allegory of\ncharity](/wiki/Charity_\\(virtue\\) \"Charity \\(virtue\\)\") handing her heart to\nChrist, this heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical\ndescriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted\nconsiderable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a\nheart is shown by [Taddeo Gaddi](/wiki/Taddeo_Gaddi \"Taddeo Gaddi\") in Santa\nCroce, by [Andrea Pisano](/wiki/Andrea_Pisano \"Andrea Pisano\") on the bronze\ndoor of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by\n[Ambrogio Lorenzetti](/wiki/Ambrogio_Lorenzetti \"Ambrogio Lorenzetti\") in the\nPalazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [Andrea da\nFirenze](/wiki/Andrea_da_Firenze \"Andrea da Firenze\") in Santa Maria Novella\nin Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward\nswitches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the\n15th century.[2]\n\nThe \"scalloped\" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its\nbase, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in\nthe miniatures in Francesco Barberino's _Documenti d 'amore_ (before 1320). A\nslightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript\nfrom the Cistercian monastery in Brussels (MS 4459–70, fol 192v. Royal Library\nof Belgium). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus\nspread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its\npoint downward.[3] The modern indented red heart has been used on [playing\ncards](/wiki/Playing_cards \"Playing cards\") since the late 15th century.[4]\n\nVarious hypotheses attempted to connect the \"heart shape\" as it evolved in the\nlate medieval period with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.[5]\nSuch theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain\nspeculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and\nthe late medieval tradition can be shown. Specific suggestions include: the\nshape of the seed of the [silphium](/wiki/Silphium \"Silphium\") plant, used in\nancient times as an [herbal contraceptive](/wiki/Herbal_contraceptive \"Herbal\ncontraceptive\"),[5][6] and stylized depictions of features of the human female\nbody, such as the female's [buttocks](/wiki/Buttocks \"Buttocks\"), [pubic\nmound](/wiki/Mons_pubis \"Mons pubis\"), or spread [vulva](/wiki/Vulva\n\"Vulva\").[7]\n\n### Renaissance and early\nmodern[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Heart_\\(symbol\\)&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Renaissance and early modern\")]\n\nHearts can be seen on the bible Jesus holds in the [Empress\nZoe](/wiki/Zoe_Porphyrogenita \"Zoe Porphyrogenita\") mosaic in the [Hagia\nSophia](/wiki/Hagia_Sophia \"Hagia Sophia\") in Istanbul.

Luther wrote an\nexplanation of the symbol to [Lazarus Spengler](/wiki/Lazarus_Spengler\n\"Lazarus Spengler\"): \"a black cross in a heart, which retains its natural\ncolor, so that I myself would be reminded that faith in the Crucified saves\nus.
