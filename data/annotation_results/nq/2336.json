LePage did not win a majority of the vote\neither time (receiving 37.6% in a crowded four-way race in 2010 and 48.2% in a\nthree-way race in 2014), with Democrats accusing independent candidate [Eliot\nCutler](/wiki/Eliot_Cutler \"Eliot Cutler\") of splitting the anti-LePage vote\nin both instances, though Cutler finished closer to LePage than Democratic\ncandidate [Libby Mitchell](/wiki/Libby_Mitchell \"Libby Mitchell\") in the 2010\nelection.[8]\n\nMaine's history of governors elected without majorities, including LePage, was\none impetus for the [citizen's referendum](/wiki/Maine_Question_5,_2016 \"Maine\nQuestion 5, 2016\") to implement [ranked choice voting](/wiki/Ranked-\nChoice_Voting \"Ranked-Choice Voting\").[9][10] Though it was approved by voters\nin a [2016 referendum](/wiki/Maine_Question_5,_2016 \"Maine Question 5, 2016\"),\nthe [Maine Legislature](/wiki/Maine_Legislature \"Maine Legislature\") voted to\ndelay and potentially repeal RCV for all elections after an [advisory\nopinion](/wiki/Advisory_opinion \"Advisory opinion\") by the [Maine Supreme\nJudicial Court](/wiki/Maine_Supreme_Judicial_Court \"Maine Supreme Judicial\nCourt\") ruled it unconstitutional for general elections for state offices. RCV\nsupporters succeeded in a people's veto effort to prevent the delay, which\nsuspends it until a June 2018 referendum vote.[11] RCV supporters were\nvictorious in the June referendum, and ranked-choice voting will remain in\nplace for state and federal primaries and federal general elections.[12]\n\n## Republican\nprimary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maine_gubernatorial_election,_2018&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Republican primary\")]\n\nSpeculation that U.S. Senator [Susan Collins](/wiki/Susan_Collins \"Susan\nCollins\") was considering running for governor arose during the 2015 [Maine\nLegislative](/wiki/Maine_Legislature \"Maine Legislature\") session when\nRepresentative [Matt Moonen](/wiki/Matt_Moonen \"Matt Moonen\") (D-Portland)\nintroduced a bill to strip the governor (LePage) of the power to appoint\nreplacement U.S. Senators in the event of a vacancy and to instead have a\nspecial primary and general election. Moonen denied that he was motivated by\nCollins's possible candidacy, saying he was interested only in\ncounterbalancing Republican-sponsored bills to change how the [Maine Attorney\nGeneral](/wiki/Maine_Attorney_General \"Maine Attorney General\") and [Maine\nSecretary of State](/wiki/Maine_Secretary_of_State \"Maine Secretary of State\")\nare chosen. Moonen said Collins had told him speculation about her running for\ngovernor was \"silly.\"[13] Collins, who was the [1994 Republican nominee for\ngovernor](/wiki/Maine_gubernatorial_election,_1994 \"Maine gubernatorial\nelection, 1994\"), told [MPBN](/wiki/MPBN \"MPBN\") News on January 4, 2016 that\nthough she was \"baffled\" by the rumors about her being interested in running\nfor governor, many had encouraged her to run, and she would not rule it\nout.[14] In October 2017, Collins said she would not run for governor in\n2018.[15]\n\nNo Republican candidate has ruled out challenging the results of a ranked-\nchoice primary in court. [Mary Mayhew](/wiki/Mary_Mayhew \"Mary Mayhew\") called\nfor the immediate repeal of RCV, calling it a \"scam\" and \"probably\nillegal\".[16]\n\nThe [Maine Republican Party](/wiki/Maine_Republican_Party \"Maine Republican\nParty\") filed a federal lawsuit in U.S. District Court in\n[Bangor](/wiki/Bangor,_Maine \"Bangor, Maine\") on May 4, 2018, seeking to bar\nthe use of RCV for its own primary on the grounds that requiring the party to\nuse it violates its [First\nAmendment](/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") rights to choose its nominee as\nit sees fit.[17] U.S. District Court Judge Jon Levy rejected the suit on May\n29.[18]\n\n###\nCandidates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maine_gubernatorial_election,_2018&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Candidates\")]\n\n####\nNominated[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maine_gubernatorial_election,_2018&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Nominated\")]\n\n  * Shawn Moody, businessman and independent candidate for Governor in [2010](/wiki/Maine_gubernatorial_election,_2010 \"Maine gubernatorial election, 2010\")[19]\n\n#### Eliminated in\nprimary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maine_gubernatorial_election,_2018&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Eliminated in primary\")]\n\n  * [Ken Fredette](/wiki/Kenneth_Fredette \"Kenneth Fredette\"), State House Minority Leader[20]\n  * [Garrett Mason](/wiki/Garrett_Mason \"Garrett Mason\"), State Senate Majority Leader[21]\n  * [Mary Mayhew](/wiki/Mary_Mayhew \"Mary Mayhew\"), former Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services[22]\n\n####\nWithdrawn[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maine_gubernatorial_election,_2018&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Withdrawn\")]\n\n  * Deril Stubenrod, write-in candidate for the U.S. Senate in [2014](/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Maine,_2014 \"United States Senate election in Maine, 2014\")[23]\n  * [Mike Thibodeau](/wiki/Mike_Thibodeau \"Mike Thibodeau\"), Maine Senate President[24]\n\n####\nDeclined[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maine_gubernatorial_election,_2018&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Declined\")]\n\n  * [Rick Bennett](/wiki/Richard_A._Bennett \"Richard A.
