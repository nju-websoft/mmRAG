The\ncharacter was created by writer-editor [Stan Lee](/wiki/Stan_Lee \"Stan Lee\")\nand writer-artist [Jack Kirby](/wiki/Jack_Kirby \"Jack Kirby\"), first appearing\nin _[Fantastic Four](/wiki/Fantastic_Four_\\(comic_book\\) \"Fantastic Four\n\\(comic book\\)\")_ #52 ([cover-dated](/wiki/Cover-date \"Cover-date\") July 1966)\nin the [Silver Age of Comic Books](/wiki/Silver_Age_of_Comic_Books \"Silver Age\nof Comic Books\"). Black Panther's real name is **T 'Challa**, king and\nprotector of the fictional African nation of\n[Wakanda](/wiki/Wakanda_\\(comics\\) \"Wakanda \\(comics\\)\"). Along with\npossessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of\ndrinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his\nproficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat\nskills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his\nenemies.\n\nBlack Panther is the first superhero of African descent in mainstream American\ncomics, having debuted years before early [African\nAmerican](/wiki/African_American \"African American\") superheroes such as\nMarvel Comics' the [Falcon](/wiki/Falcon_\\(comics\\) \"Falcon \\(comics\\)\")\n(1969), [Luke Cage](/wiki/Luke_Cage \"Luke Cage\") (1972) and\n[Blade](/wiki/Blade_\\(comics\\) \"Blade \\(comics\\)\") (1973), or [DC\nComics](/wiki/DC_Comics \"DC Comics\")' [John\nStewart](/wiki/John_Stewart_\\(comics\\) \"John Stewart \\(comics\\)\") in the role\nof [Green Lantern](/wiki/Green_Lantern \"Green Lantern\") (1971). In one comic\nbook storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by [Kasper\nCole](/wiki/White_Tiger_\\(Kasper_Cole\\) \"White Tiger \\(Kasper Cole\\)\"), a\nmultiracial [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") [police\nofficer](/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department \"New York City Police\nDepartment\"). Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the\nmoniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black\nPanther and leadership of Wakanda is also given to T'Challa's sister\n[Shuri](/wiki/Shuri_\\(comics\\) \"Shuri \\(comics\\)\") for a time when he is left\nrecovering from critical injuries.\n\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows,\nanimated films and video games. The character is portrayed in live action by\n[Chadwick Boseman](/wiki/Chadwick_Boseman \"Chadwick Boseman\") in the 2016 film\n_[Captain America: Civil War](/wiki/Captain_America:_Civil_War \"Captain\nAmerica: Civil War\")_ , and the 2018 films _[Black\nPanther](/wiki/Black_Panther_\\(film\\) \"Black Panther \\(film\\)\")_ and\n_[Avengers: Infinity War](/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War \"Avengers: Infinity\nWar\")_ , set in the [Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse](/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\").\n\nIn 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on [IGN](/wiki/IGN \"IGN\")'s\n\"Top 100 Comic Books Heroes\" list.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Concept and creation\n    * 1.1 Name\n    * 1.2 Publication history\n  * 2 Fictional character biography\n    * 2.1 Early life and background\n    * 2.2 Return to Wakanda\n    * 2.3 Marriage and passing the mantle\n    * 2.4 The Man Without Fear\n    * 2.5 Wakanda again\n    * 2.6 Incursions\n    * 2.7 Secret Wars\n    * 2.8 All-New, All-Different Marvel\n  * 3 Powers and abilities\n  * 4 Other Black Panthers\n    * 4.1 Bashenga\n    * 4.2 Chanda\n    * 4.3 T'Chaka\n    * 4.4 Erik Killmonger/ N'Jadaka\n    * 4.5 S'Yan\n    * 4.6 Shuri\n  * 5 Reception\n    * 5.1 Volume 3\n    * 5.2 Volume 4\n  * 6 Other versions\n    * 6.1 Earth-355\n    * 6.2 Age of Ultron\n    * 6.3 Amalgam Comics\n    * 6.4 Avengers Forever\n    * 6.5 Civil War\n    * 6.6 Earth-6606\n    * 6.7 Earth X\n    * 6.8 Exiles\n    * 6.9 Fox Kids\n    * 6.10 Mangaverse\n    * 6.11 Marvel 2099\n    * 6.12 Marvel Knights 2099\n    * 6.13 Marvel Zombies\n    * 6.14 MC2\n    * 6.15 Mutant X\n    * 6.16 Ultimate Marvel\n  * 7 In other media\n    * 7.1 Television\n    * 7.2 Film\n      * 7.2.1 Live-action\n      * 7.2.2 Animation\n      * 7.2.3 Web\n    * 7.3 Video games\n    * 7.4 Role-playing games\n  * 8 Collected editions\n    * 8.1 Marvel Masterworks\n    * 8.2 Epic Collections\n    * 8.3 Volume 1\n    * 8.4 Volume 3\n    * 8.5 Volume 4\n    * 8.6 Volume 5\n    * 8.7 The Man Without Fear/The Most Dangerous Man Alive\n    * 8.8 Volume 6\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 References\n  * 11 External links\n\n## Concept and\ncreation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Black_Panther_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Concept and creation\")]\n\n###\nName[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Black_Panther_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Name\")]\n\nThe Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the [Black\nPanther Party](/wiki/Black_Panther_Party \"Black Panther Party\"), though not\nthe black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the [Lowndes County Freedom\nOrganization](/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee#Lowndes_County_Freedom_Organization\n\"Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee\") (LCFO), nor the\n[segregated](/wiki/Racial_segregation \"Racial segregation\") [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") [Black Panthers Tank\nBattalion](/wiki/761st_Tank_Battalion_\\(United_States\\) \"761st Tank Battalion\n\\(United States\\)\").[2][3] Stan Lee, co-creator of the comic, denied that the\ncomic was named after any of the political uses of the term \"black panther\",\nincluding the LCFO, citing \"a strange coincidence\".[4] He is the first black\nsuperhero in American mainstream [comic books](/wiki/Comic_book \"Comic book\");\nvery few black heroes were created before him, and none with actual\nsuperpowers. These included the characters in the single-issue, low-\ndistribution _[All-Negro Comics](/wiki/All-Negro_Comics \"All-Negro Comics\")_\n#1 (1947); Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the\nomnibus title _[Jungle Tales](/wiki/Jungle_Tales \"Jungle Tales\")_ , from\nMarvel's 1950s predecessor, [Atlas Comics](/wiki/Atlas_Comics_\\(1950s\\) \"Atlas\nComics \\(1950s\\)\"); and the [Dell Comics](/wiki/Dell_Comics \"Dell Comics\")\n[Western](/wiki/Western_comics \"Western comics\") character\n[Lobo](/wiki/Lobo_\\(Dell_Comics\\) \"Lobo \\(Dell Comics\\)\"), the first black\nperson to star in his own comic book.

During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-\nappearances in three issues of\n_[Daredevil](/wiki/Daredevil_\\(Marvel_Comics_series\\) \"Daredevil \\(Marvel\nComics series\\)\")_ , and fought [Doctor Doom](/wiki/Doctor_Doom \"Doctor Doom\")\nin _[Astonishing Tales](/wiki/Astonishing_Tales \"Astonishing Tales\")_ #6–7\n(June & Aug. 1971), in that [supervillain](/wiki/Supervillain\n\"Supervillain\")'s short-lived starring feature.\n\nHe received his first starring feature with _[Jungle\nAction](/wiki/Jungle_Action \"Jungle Action\")_ #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the\nPanther-centric story in _The Avengers_ #62 (March 1969). A new series began\nrunning the following issue, written by [Don McGregor](/wiki/Don_McGregor \"Don\nMcGregor\"), with art by [pencilers](/wiki/Pencilers \"Pencilers\") [Rich\nBuckler](/wiki/Rich_Buckler \"Rich Buckler\"), [Gil Kane](/wiki/Gil_Kane \"Gil\nKane\"), and [Billy Graham](/wiki/Billy_Graham_\\(comics\\) \"Billy Graham\n\\(comics\\)\"), and which gave inkers [Klaus Janson](/wiki/Klaus_Janson \"Klaus\nJanson\") and [Bob McLeod](/wiki/Bob_McLeod_\\(comics\\) \"Bob McLeod \\(comics\\)\")\nsome of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed[9] series\nran in _Jungle Action_ #6–24 (Sept. 1973 – Nov. 1976).[10]\n\nOne now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained,\nmulti-issue story arc.[11] The first, \"Panther's Rage\", ran through the first\n13 issues. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc \"Marvel's first [graphic\nnovel](/wiki/Graphic_novel \"Graphic novel\")\":\n\n> [T]here were real character arcs in [Spider-Man](/wiki/Spider-Man \"Spider-\n> Man\") and the [Fantastic Four](/wiki/Fantastic_Four \"Fantastic Four\")\n> [comics] over time. But ... \"Panther's Rage\" is the first comic that was\n> created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years'\n> issues of _Jungle Action_ (#s 6 through 18), \"Panther's Rage\" is a 200-page\n> novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda, a nation\n> ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.[11]\n\nThe second and final arc, \"Panther vs. the Klan\", ran as mostly 17-page\nstories in _Jungle Action_ #19–24 (Jan.–Nov. 1976), except for issue #23, a\nreprint of _Daredevil_ #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-\nstarred.[10] The subject matter of the [Ku Klux Klan](/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan \"Ku\nKlux Klan\") was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time,\ncreating difficulties for the creative team.[12]\n\nAfrican-American writer-editor [Dwayne McDuffie](/wiki/Dwayne_McDuffie \"Dwayne\nMcDuffie\") said of the _Jungle Action_ \"Black Panther\" feature:\n\n> This overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written\n> multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it ... sit down\n> and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene,\n> a functional, necessary part of the whole.

You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures;\n> clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even\n> transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least\n> one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills\n> and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite\n> and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every\n> single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per\n> issue.[9]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/59/Jungleaction23.png/220px-\nJungleaction23.png)](/wiki/File:Jungleaction23.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jungleaction23.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nCover of _[Jungle Action](/wiki/Jungle_Action \"Jungle Action\")_ #23 (Sept.\n1976).

However, Kirby wanted to work on new characters and was unhappy at\nbeing assigned a series starring a character he had already worked with\nextensively.[14] He left the series after only 12 issues and was replaced by\n[Ed Hannigan](/wiki/Ed_Hannigan \"Ed Hannigan\") (writer), [Jerry\nBingham](/wiki/Jerry_Bingham \"Jerry Bingham\") (penciler), and [Roger\nStern](/wiki/Roger_Stern \"Roger Stern\") (editor). _Black Panther_ ran 15\nissues (Jan. 1977 – May 1979).[15] Due to the series's cancellation, the\ncontents of what would have been _Black Panther_ #16–18 were published in\n_[Marvel Premiere](/wiki/Marvel_Premiere \"Marvel Premiere\")_ #51–53.\n\nA four-issue [miniseries](/wiki/Miniseries \"Miniseries\"), _Black Panther_ vol.\n2,[16] (July–Oct. 1988) was written by [Peter B. Gillis](/wiki/Peter_B._Gillis\n\"Peter B. Gillis\") and penciled by [Denys Cowan](/wiki/Denys_Cowan \"Denys\nCowan\").[17] McGregor revisited his Panther saga with [Gene\nColan](/wiki/Gene_Colan \"Gene Colan\") in \"Panther's Quest\", published as 25\neight-page installments within the bi-weekly [anthology](/wiki/Anthology\n\"Anthology\") series _[Marvel Comics Presents](/wiki/Marvel_Comics_Presents\n\"Marvel Comics Presents\")_ (issues #13–37, Feb.–Dec. 1989).[18] He later\nteamed with artist [Dwayne Turner](/wiki/Dwayne_Turner \"Dwayne Turner\") in the\nsquare-bound miniseries _Black Panther: Panther 's Prey_ (Sept. 1990 – March\n1991).[19] McGregor conceived a fifth arc in his Black Panther saga, titled\n\"Panther's Vows\", but it failed to get off the ground.[13]\n\nWriter [Christopher Priest](/wiki/Christopher_Priest_\\(comics\\) \"Christopher\nPriest \\(comics\\)\")'s and penciller [Mark Texeira](/wiki/Mark_Texeira \"Mark\nTexeira\")'s 1998 series _The Black Panther_ vol. 3 used [Erik\nKillmonger](/wiki/Erik_Killmonger \"Erik Killmonger\"), [Venomm](/wiki/Venomm\n\"Venomm\"), and other characters introduced in \"Panther's Rage\", together with\nnew characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross; the Black\nPanther's adopted brother, Hunter; and the Panther's protégé, Queen Divine\nJustice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the [Marvel\nKnights](/wiki/Marvel_Knights \"Marvel Knights\") imprint in its first year.\nPriest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision\nto write the series. \"I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between\nthe African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the\npredominantly white readership that Marvel sells to,\" adding that in his\nopinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his\ncreation.[20]\n\nThe last 13 issues (#50–62) saw the main character replaced by a\n[multiracial](/wiki/Multiracial \"Multiracial\") [New York City police\nofficer](/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department \"New York City Police\nDepartment\") named [Kasper Cole](/wiki/Kasper_Cole \"Kasper Cole\"), with\nT'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became\nthe [White Tiger](/wiki/White_Tiger_\\(comics\\)#Kasper_Cole \"White Tiger\n\\(comics\\)\"), was placed in the series _[The Crew](/wiki/The_Crew_\\(comics\\)\n\"The Crew \\(comics\\)\")_ , running concurrently with the final few _Black\nPanther_ issues. _The Crew_ was canceled with issue #7.\n\nIn 2005, Marvel began publishing _Black Panther_ vol. 4,[21] which ran 41\nissues (April 2005 – Nov. 2008).[22] It was initially written by filmmaker\n[Reginald Hudlin](/wiki/Reginald_Hudlin \"Reginald Hudlin\") (through issue #38)\nand penciled by [John Romita, Jr.](/wiki/John_Romita,_Jr. \"John Romita, Jr.\")\n(through #6). Hudlin said he wanted to add \"[street cred](/wiki/Credibility\n\"Credibility\")\" to the title, although he noted that the book was not\nnecessarily or primarily geared toward an African-American readership.[23] As\ninfluences for his characterization of the character, Hudlin has cited comic\ncharacter [Batman](/wiki/Batman \"Batman\"), film director [Spike\nLee](/wiki/Spike_Lee \"Spike Lee\"), and music artist [Sean\nCombs](/wiki/Sean_Combs \"Sean Combs\").[23] Other influences include historical\nfigures such as 14th-century [Mali Empire](/wiki/Mali_Empire \"Mali Empire\")\nsultan [Mansa Musa](/wiki/Mansa_Musa \"Mansa Musa\") and 20th-century Jamaican\nactivist [Marcus Garvey](/wiki/Marcus_Garvey \"Marcus Garvey\"), as well as\n[Biblical](/wiki/Biblical \"Biblical\") figures such as\n[Ham](/wiki/Ham_\\(son_of_Noah\\) \"Ham \\(son of Noah\\)\") and\n[Canaan](/wiki/Canaan_\\(son_of_Ham\\) \"Canaan \\(son of Ham\\)\").[24]\n\n_Black Panther_ vol. 5[25] launched in February 2009, with Hudlin, again\nscripting, introducing a successor Black Panther, T'Challa's sister\nShuri.[26][27][28] Hudlin co-wrote issue #7 with [Jonathan\nMaberry](/wiki/Jonathan_Maberry \"Jonathan Maberry\"), who then became the new\nwriter,[29] joined by artist Will Conrad.[30] The Panther was also a featured\nplayer, with members of the Fantastic Four and the [X-Men](/wiki/X-Men\n\"X-Men\"), in the Doctor Doom-based, six-issue miniseries _Doomwar_\n(April–Sept. 2010).[31]\n\nT'Challa then accepted an invitation from Matt Murdock, the superhero\nDaredevil, to become the new protector of New York City's [Hell's\nKitchen](/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen,_Manhattan \"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan\")\nneighborhood. He became the lead character in _Daredevil_ beginning with issue\n#513 (Feb. 2011), when that series was retitled _Black Panther: The Man\nWithout Fear_.[32] Under writer David Liss and artist Francesco Francavilla,\nhe took on the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the [Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo](/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo \"Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo\"), and becomes the owner of a small diner in order to be\nclose to the people.[33]\n\nA new _Black Panther_ series written by [Ta-Nehisi Coates](/wiki/Ta-\nNehisi_Coates \"Ta-Nehisi Coates\") and drawn by [Brian\nStelfreeze](/wiki/Brian_Stelfreeze \"Brian Stelfreeze\") was launched in 2016\nand continues to be published with Coates as the head writer.[34][35][36]\n\nIn 2017, the [afrofuturist](/wiki/Afrofuturist \"Afrofuturist\") writer [Nnedi\nOkorafor](/wiki/Nnedi_Okorafor \"Nnedi Okorafor\") wrote the series _Black\nPanther: Long Live the King_.[37]\n\n## Fictional character\nbiography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Black_Panther_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Fictional character biography\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png) |  This section **describes a work or element of fiction in a primarily[in-universe](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Writing_about_fiction \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Writing about fiction\") style**.

In addition to ruling the\ncountry, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as\nthe Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is\nused even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but\none must still earn it.\n\nIn the distant past, a [meteorite](/wiki/Meteorite \"Meteorite\") made of the\n(fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral [vibranium](/wiki/Vibranium\n\"Vibranium\") crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders\nwould exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, King\n[T'Chaka](/wiki/T%27Chaka \"T'Chaka\"), like his father and other Panthers\nbefore him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife\nN'Yami died while in labor with **T 'Challa**, and his second wife\n[Ramonda](/wiki/Ramonda_\\(comics\\) \"Ramonda \\(comics\\)\") was taken prisoner by\nAnton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of [South\nAfrica](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\"), so for most of his childhood\nT'Challa was raised by his father alone.[38] T'Chaka was murdered by the\nadventurer [Ulysses Klaw](/wiki/Klaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Klaw \\(Marvel\nComics\\)\") in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With his people still\nin danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men,\nshattering Klaw's right hand and forcing him to flee.[39]\n\nT'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but\nuntil he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan\n(T'Chaka's younger brother) successfully passed the trials to become the Black\nPanther. While on his Wakandan [walkabout](/wiki/Walkabout \"Walkabout\") [rite\nof passage](/wiki/Rite_of_passage \"Rite of passage\"), T'Challa met and fell in\nlove with apparent orphaned teen [Ororo Munroe](/wiki/Storm_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)\n\"Storm \\(Marvel Comics\\)\"), who would grow up to become the X-Men member\nStorm.[40] The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge\nhis father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead\nWakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.\n\nT'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the\nvarious champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband\nand exile the Hatut Zeraze—the Wakandan [secret police](/wiki/Secret_police\n\"Secret police\")—and its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White\nWolf.[41] He sold off small portions of vibranium to scientific institutions\naround the world, amassing a fortune which he used to arm himself with\nadvanced technology.[39] Later, to keep peace, he picked _dora milaje_\n(\"adored ones\") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and\nceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time before\nreturning to his kingship.\n\nIn his first published appearance, the now-adult T'Challa invites the American\nsuperhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and attempts to\nneutralize them individually in order to test himself to see if he is ready to\nbattle Klaw, who had replaced his shattered right hand with a sonic\nweapon.[42][43] For their part, the Four manage to rally and stymie T'Challa\nin a team counter-attack, enabling the impressed King to stand down and\nexplain himself to the team's satisfaction. After the ruler makes proper\namends to the Four, they befriend and help T'Challa, and he in turn aids them\nagainst the supervillain the [Psycho-Man](/wiki/Psycho-Man \"Psycho-Man\").[44]\nT'Challa later joins the Avengers,[45] beginning a long association with that\nsuperhero team. He first battles the [Man-Ape](/wiki/Man-Ape \"Man-Ape\") while\nwith the group,[46] and then meets the American singer Monica Lynne,[47] with\nwhom he becomes romantically involved. He helps the Avengers defeat the second\n[Sons of the Serpent](/wiki/Sons_of_the_Serpent \"Sons of the Serpent\"), and\nthen reveals his true identity on American television.[48] He encounters\nDaredevil, and reveals to him that he had deduced Daredevil's true\nidentity.[49]\n\n### Return to\nWakanda[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Black_Panther_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Return to Wakanda\")]\n\nAfter receiving numerous urgent official letters requesting him to return to\nhis increasingly troubled homeland,[50] the Panther eventually leaves his\nactive Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war,\nbringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper Erik Killmonger and\nhis minions,[51] the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the Ku\nKlux Klan.[52] He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting\nartifacts known as [King Solomon's Frogs](/wiki/King_Solomon%27s_Frogs \"King\nSolomon's Frogs\").[53] These produce an alternate version of T'Challa from a\nfuture 10 years hence, a merry, [telepathic](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\")\nPanther with a terminal [brain aneurysm](/wiki/Cerebral_aneurysm \"Cerebral\naneurysm\"), whom T'Challa places in cryogenic stasis.\n\nLater, while searching for and finding his stepmother Ramonda, the Panther\ncontends with South African authorities during [Apartheid](/wiki/Apartheid\n\"Apartheid\").[54] T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica\nLynne,[55] though the couple never marry.\n\nYears later, the Panther accepts a [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C.\n\"Washington, D.C.\") envoy, [Everett K. Ross](/wiki/Everett_K._Ross \"Everett K.\nRoss\"), and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him\nin many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross\nin return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is \"Xcon\", an alliance of\nrogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.[56]\nAfterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy.\nThis forces T'Challa to [nationalize](/wiki/Nationalize \"Nationalize\") foreign\ncompanies.[57] Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting\nthe role of Black Panther,[58] but falls into a [coma](/wiki/Coma \"Coma\") upon\neating the heart-shaped herb—poisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline,\nwhich had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects.[59] T'Challa preserves\nhis rival's life rather than allowing him to die.\n\nLater, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self,\nand succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost\ncauses tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council[60] and hides in\nNew York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an\nabandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to\nface his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the\nAvengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.\n\n### Marriage and passing the\nmantle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Black_Panther_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Marriage and passing the mantle\")]\n\nMain article: [Civil War (comics)](/wiki/Civil_War_\\(comics\\) \"Civil War\n\\(comics\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/Stormbpmarriage.PNG/170px-\nStormbpmarriage.PNG)](/wiki/File:Stormbpmarriage.PNG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Stormbpmarriage.PNG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe marriage of [Storm](/wiki/Storm_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Storm \\(Marvel\nComics\\)\") and the Black Panther.

As a result, he works with his sorcerer, Zawavari,\nto accumulate a replacement.[74] He has since made a pact with another unknown\nPanther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as\nplacing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most\nmagic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the\nimminent battle with Doctor Doom,[75] which culminated in T'Challa rendering\nall of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild\nwithout their dependence on the element.[76]\n\n### The Man Without\nFear[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Black_Panther_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: The Man Without Fear\")]\n\nAfter the events of \"[Shadowland](/wiki/Shadowland_\\(comics\\) \"Shadowland\n\\(comics\\)\")\", Matt Murdock (the superhero\n[Daredevil](/wiki/Daredevil_\\(Marvel_Comics_character\\) \"Daredevil \\(Marvel\nComics character\\)\")) asks T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's\nKitchen, which gives T'Challa a chance to discover himself.

The conflict between Vlad and the\nPanther becomes more personal, especially after Vlad discovers the Panther\nover his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.[77]\n\nT'Challa learns that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of\nchildren—Gabe was abused secretly by Angela. Brian was kidnapped by his\ndoctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who\nreceived a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous\nexperiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by\nGabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the\nrecipient with Vlad's powers.

Both sides work to find Klaue as Captain America states to Black Panther that T'Chaka gave the vibranium for Stark to make into Captain America's shield. Tracking him to a hideout in the [Himalayas](/wiki/Himalayas \"Himalayas\"), the Avengers and Black Panther engage Klaue in an armor made out of vibranium. With a special tactic, the Avengers and Black Panther were able to knock Klaue out of the armor as Black Panther plans to make Ulysses Klaue answer for his crimes. With Klaue's vibranium armor in Wakandan custody, Black Panther changes his opinion of the Avengers and is offered reserve membership into the group.
