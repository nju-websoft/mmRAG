Additionally, OCC\nlaunched a limited edition production line of motorcycles in July 2007, priced\nbeginning at $31,000.\n\nOne of OCC's most popular bikes is The Fire Bike, to commemorate the New York\nfirefighters who lost their lives on 9/11. The bike itself has been modeled\nafter a fire truck, and an actual steel rivet from the World Trade Center has\nbeen integrated into the bike itself, mounted atop the bike's gas tank. Paul\nJr. stated that the bike was named \"343\", the number of New York firefighters\nwho gave their lives on 9/11.[1]\n\nThe popularity of _American Chopper_ led the United States Air Force to\ncommission a $150,000 \"Air Force Bike\", first put on public display in March\n2005. The motorcycle is ten feet long and is modeled after the [F-22\nRaptor](/wiki/F-22_Raptor \"F-22 Raptor\"), complete with Air Force symbol rims,\nriveted gas tank, Raptor exhausts and rear view mirrors in the shape of jets.\n\n##\nMusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Orange_County_Choppers&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\nOrange County Choppers held a series of free music performances within the\nretail store.

Additionally, OCC in October in conjunction with\nRED/Sony released a classic rock compilation CD featuring some of Paul Sr.'s\nfavorite songs titled _OCC Rocks_. The CD also includes original music from\nThe OCC Band, which features four of the shop's employees. [Black Label\nSociety](/wiki/Black_Label_Society \"Black Label Society\") performed a concert\nin the retail store to promote their album _[Order of the\nBlack](/wiki/Order_of_the_Black \"Order of the Black\")_.[2]\n\n## Orange County Choppers\nMotoCoaster[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Orange_County_Choppers&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Orange County Choppers MotoCoaster\")]\n\nThe MotoCoaster is a [Zamperla](/wiki/Zamperla \"Zamperla\") built motorbike\nthemed roller coaster installed at [Darien Lake](/wiki/Darien_Lake \"Darien\nLake\") theme park in Darien Lake, NY. It was the first motorbike roller\ncoaster to be installed in the United States, though the [Pony\nExpress](/wiki/Pony_Express \"Pony Express\"), a similar model of coaster with\nhorse themed trains, was erected [Knott's Berry\nFarm](/wiki/Knott%27s_Berry_Farm \"Knott's Berry Farm\"). The MotoCoaster is the\nsame model as the prototype located outside Zamperla's factory in Italy.\n\nThe MotoCoaster opened in May 2008 with Orange County Choppers securing the\n[naming rights](/wiki/Naming_rights \"Naming rights\"). The MotoCoaster is\nlocated near the Darien Square area of the park, between Boomerang and\nTwister. Orange County Choppers built a custom motorcycle inspired by the ride\nand the park. The coaster was originally named the Orange County Choppers\nMotocoaster when it first opened in 2008. However, the name was changed to the\nMotoCoaster in 2010 after the naming rights with OCC expired.\n\n## Popular\nmeme[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Orange_County_Choppers&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Popular meme\")]\n\nA popular internet [meme](/wiki/Meme \"Meme\"), started in 2011 and based on the\nshow, became widely popular on social media in early 2018. The meme consists\nof five panels depicting a dispute between Paul Sr. and his son Paul Jr. In\nthe original scene, Paul Sr. shouts at Paul Jr. for being late to work and\nPaul Jr. shouts back, throws a chair, and then eventually storms away.
