She married [Nepalese American](/wiki/Nepalese_Americans \"Nepalese\nAmericans\") Citizen Alexander Poudar, although became a widow very early and\nhad no children. Her extreme longevity claim was certified by [Alexander\nGraham Bell](/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell \"Alexander Graham Bell\").[77] In her\nlast few months, she was bedridden, [blind](/wiki/Blindness \"Blindness\"), and\nalmost [deaf](/wiki/Deaf \"Deaf\"), but her mind remained sharp.[78]\n\n### Florence\nKnapp[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_supercentenarians_from_the_United_States&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Florence Knapp\")]\n\nFlorence Knapp (October 10, 1873 – January 11, 1988) was, for the last two\nweeks of her life, recognized by the [Guinness Book of World\nRecords](/wiki/Guinness_World_Records \"Guinness World Records\") as the oldest\nperson in the world.[79]\n\nBorn in [Lansdale, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Lansdale,_Pennsylvania \"Lansdale,\nPennsylvania\"), she lived in nearby Montgomery Square much of her life and\ncame from a large and long-lived family, eight of her siblings dying in their\n80s and 90s and one sister reaching [age 108](/wiki/Centenarian\n\"Centenarian\").\n\nBy October 1987, when she was honored by the Pennsylvania legislature, she was\nrecognized by Guinness as the oldest person in the United States, and the\ndeath of [Anna Eliza Williams](/wiki/Anna_Eliza_Williams \"Anna Eliza\nWilliams\") on December 27, 1987, meant that Knapp became the oldest verified\nliving person. Her death, aged 114 years 93 days, just 15 days after, meant\nthat she never appeared in a Guinness Book as the oldest living person.\n\nHer death caused some confusion as to who her successor was, with Guinness\nrecognition and press publicity alighting first on Orpha Nusbaum (August 1875\n– March 1988), who died before the 1989 edition's deadline, then Birdie May\nVogt (August 1876 – July 1989), who appeared in the 1989 edition's main text,\nthen [Jeanne Calment](/wiki/Jeanne_Calment \"Jeanne Calment\"), mentioned in the\naddenda section, and finally in November 1988 on [Carrie C.\nWhite](/wiki/Carrie_C._White \"Carrie C.
