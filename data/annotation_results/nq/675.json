This was countered, however, by Edward I's victory\nat the [Battle of Falkirk (1298)](/wiki/Battle_of_Falkirk_\\(1298\\) \"Battle of\nFalkirk \\(1298\\)\").[10] By 1304 Scotland had been conquered, but in 1306\n[Robert the Bruce](/wiki/Robert_the_Bruce \"Robert the Bruce\") seized the\nScottish throne and the war was reopened.[10]\n\n[Edward II of England](/wiki/Edward_II_of_England \"Edward II of England\") came\nto the throne in 1307 but was incapable of providing the determined leadership\nthat had been shown by his father, Edward I, and the English position soon\nbecame more difficult.[10] [Stirling Castle](/wiki/Stirling_Castle \"Stirling\nCastle\") was one of the most important castles that was held by the English as\nit commanded the route north into the [Scottish\nHighlands](/wiki/Scottish_Highlands \"Scottish Highlands\").[10] It was besieged\nin 1314 by Robert the Bruce's brother, [Edward Bruce](/wiki/Edward_Bruce\n\"Edward Bruce\"), and an agreement was made that if the castle was not relieved\nby mid-summer then it would be surrendered to the Scots.[10] The English could\nnot ignore this challenge and military preparations were made for a\nsubstantial campaign in which the English army probably numbered 2,000 cavalry\nand 15,000 infantry, many of whom would have been [longbowmen](/wiki/Longbow\n\"Longbow\").[10] The Scottish army probably numbered between 7,000 and 10,000\nmen, of whom no more than 500 would have been mounted.[10] Unlike the heavily\narmoured English cavalry, the Scottish cavalry would have been light horsemen\nwho were good for skirmishing and reconnaissance but were not suitable for\ncharging the enemy lines.[10] The Scottish infantry would have had axes,\nswords and pikes, with few bowmen among them.[10]\n\nThe precise size of the English force relative to the Scottish forces is\nunclear but estimates range from as much as at least two or three times the\nsize of the army Bruce had been able to gather, to as little as only 50%\nlarger.[11]\n\n##\nPrelude[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Prelude\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Battle_from_Holkham_Bible.jpg/300px-\nBattle_from_Holkham_Bible.jpg)](/wiki/File:Battle_from_Holkham_Bible.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Battle_from_Holkham_Bible.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn early 14th century English depiction of a Biblical battle giving an\nimpression of how soldiers were equipped at Bannockburn. The image of a king\nwielding a battle axe in the top half has led some historians to link this\nimage to Bannockburn.\n\nEdward II and his advisors were aware of the places that the Scots were likely\nto challenge them and sent out orders for their troops to prepare for an enemy\nestablished in boggy ground near to the [River Forth](/wiki/River_Forth \"River\nForth\"), near [Stirling](/wiki/Stirling \"Stirling\").[10] The English appear to\nhave advanced in four divisions whereas the Scots were in three divisions,\nknown as '[schiltrons](/wiki/Sheltron \"Sheltron\")' which were strong defensive\ncircles of men bristling with pikes.[10] [Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of\nMoray](/wiki/Thomas_Randolph,_1st_Earl_of_Moray \"Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of\nMoray\"), commanded the Scottish [vanguard](/wiki/Vanguard_\\(military_tactics\\)\n\"Vanguard \\(military tactics\\)\"), which was stationed about a mile to the\nsouth of Stirling, near the church of St. Ninian, while the king commanded the\nrearguard at the entrance to the New Park. His brother Edward led the third\ndivision. According to Barbour, there was a fourth division nominally under\nthe youthful [Walter the\nSteward](/wiki/Walter_Stewart,_6th_High_Steward_of_Scotland \"Walter Stewart,\n6th High Steward of Scotland\"), but actually under the command of [Sir James\nDouglas](/wiki/James_Douglas,_Lord_of_Douglas \"James Douglas, Lord of\nDouglas\").[12] The Scottish archers used yew-stave longbows and though these\nwere not weaker than or inferior to English longbows, there were fewer\nScottish archers than English archers,[13] possibly numbering only 500. These\narchers played little part in the battle.[14] There is firsthand evidence in a\npoem by the captured Carmelite friar Robert Baston, written just after the\nbattle, that one or both sides employed slingers and crossbowmen.[15]\n\n##\nBattle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Battle\")]\n\n### Location of the\nbattlefield[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Location of the battlefield\")]\n\nThere is some confusion over the exact site of the Battle of\n[Bannockburn](/wiki/Bannockburn \"Bannockburn\"),[16] although most modern\nhistorians agree that the traditional site,[17] where a visitor centre and\nstatue have been erected, is not the correct one.[18] Although a large number\nof possible alternatives have been proposed, most can be dismissed leaving two\nserious contenders:[19]\n\n  * the area of peaty ground known as the Dryfield outside the village of [Balquhiderock](/w/index.php?title=Balquhiderock&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Balquhiderock \\(page does not exist\\)\"), about three-quarters of a mile to the east of the traditional site,[20] and\n  * the Carse of Balquhiderock, about a mile and a half north-east of the traditional site, accepted by the [National Trust](/wiki/National_Trust_for_Scotland \"National Trust for Scotland\") as the most likely candidate.[21]\n\n### First day of\nbattle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: First day of battle\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Mapbannockburn1.svg/300px-\nMapbannockburn1.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Mapbannockburn1.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mapbannockburn1.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn interpretation of the battle of Bannockburn-first day\n\nMost medieval battles were short-lived, lasting only a few hours, so that the\nBattle of Bannockburn is unusual in lasting two days.[10] On 23 June 1314 two\nof the English cavalry formations advanced, the first commanded by the [Earl\nof Gloucester](/wiki/Gilbert_de_Clare,_8th_Earl_of_Gloucester \"Gilbert de\nClare, 8th Earl of Gloucester\") and the [Earl of\nHereford](/wiki/Humphrey_de_Bohun,_4th_Earl_of_Hereford \"Humphrey de Bohun,\n4th Earl of Hereford\").[10] They encountered a body of Scots, among them\nRobert the Bruce himself.[10] A celebrated single combat then took place\nbetween Bruce and [Henry de Bohun](/wiki/Henry_de_Bohun \"Henry de Bohun\") who\nwas the nephew of the Earl of Hereford.[10] Bohun charged at Bruce and when\nthe two passed side by side, Bruce split Bohun's head with his axe.[10][22]\nThe Scots then rushed upon the English under Gloucester and Hereford who\nstruggled back over the Bannockburn.[23]\n\nThe second English cavalry force was commanded by [Robert\nClifford](/wiki/Robert_de_Clifford,_1st_Baron_de_Clifford \"Robert de Clifford,\n1st Baron de Clifford\") and [Henry de Beaumont](/wiki/Henry_de_Beaumont \"Henry\nde Beaumont\") and included Sir [Thomas de Grey of\nHeaton](/wiki/Thomas_Grey_\\(of_Heaton\\) \"Thomas Grey \\(of Heaton\\)\"), father\nof the chronicler [Thomas Grey](/wiki/Thomas_Grey_\\(chronicler\\) \"Thomas Grey\n\\(chronicler\\)\") whose account of events follows;\n\n> Robert Lord de Clifford and Henry de Beaumont, with three hundred men-at-\n> arms, made a circuit upon the other side of the wood towards the castle,\n> keeping the open ground.

Edward is\nsupposed to have said in surprise \"They pray for mercy!\" \"For mercy, yes,\" one\nof his attendants replied, \"But from God, not you. These men will conquer or\ndie.\"[25] The English responded to the Scots advance with a charge of their\nown, led by the Earl of Gloucester. Gloucester had argued with the Earl of\nHereford over who should lead the vanguard into battle, and argued with the\nking that the battle should be postponed. This led the king to accuse him of\ncowardice, which perhaps goaded Gloucester into the charge.[10] Few\naccompanied Gloucester in his charge and when he reached the Scottish lines he\nwas quickly surrounded and killed.[10] Gradually the English were pushed back\nand ground down by the Scots' [schiltrons](/wiki/Schiltron \"Schiltron\").[10]\nThe English longbowmen attempted to support the advance of the knights but\nwere ordered to stop shooting, as they were causing casualties among their\nown. An attempt to deploy the English and Welsh longbowmen to shoot at the\nadvancing Scots from their flank failed when they were dispersed by 500\nScottish cavalry under the Marischal [Sir Robert\nKeith](/wiki/Robert_II_Keith,_Marischal_of_Scotland \"Robert II Keith,\nMarischal of Scotland\").[26] Although these are sometimes described as light\ncavalry, this appears to be a misinterpretation of Barbour's statement that\nthese were men-at arms on lighter horses than their English counterparts.[27]\nThe English cavalry was hemmed in, making it difficult for them to\nmanoeuvre.[10] As a result, the English were unable to hold their formations\nand broke ranks.[10] It soon became clear to [Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of\nPembroke](/wiki/Aymer_de_Valence,_2nd_Earl_of_Pembroke \"Aymer de Valence, 2nd\nEarl of Pembroke\") and [Giles d'Argentan](/wiki/Giles_d%27Argentan \"Giles\nd'Argentan\") (reputedly the third best knight in Europe) that the English had\nlost and Edward II needed to be led to safety at all costs. So, seizing his\nhorse's reins, they dragged him away, closely followed by five hundred knights\nof the royal bodyguard.[28] Once they were clear of the battle d'Argentan\nturned to the king, said \"_Sire, your protection was committed to me, but\nsince you are safely on your way, I will bid you farewell for never yet have I\nfled from a battle, nor will I now._ \" and turned his horse to charge back\ninto the ranks of Scottish where he was overborne and slain.[29]\n\n### English\nretreat[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: English retreat\")]\n\nEdward fled with his personal bodyguard, ending the remaining order in the\narmy; panic spread and defeat turned into a [rout](/wiki/Rout \"Rout\"). He\narrived eventually at [Dunbar Castle](/wiki/Dunbar_Castle \"Dunbar Castle\"),\nfrom which he took ship to Berwick. From the carnage of Bannockburn, the rest\nof the army tried to escape to the safety of the English border, ninety miles\nto the south. Many were killed by the pursuing Scottish army or by the\ninhabitants of the countryside that they passed through. Historian Peter Reese\nsays that, \"only one sizeable group of men—all foot soldiers—made good their\nescape to England.\"[9] These were a force of Welsh spearmen who were kept\ntogether by their commander, [Sir Maurice de\nBerkeley](/wiki/Maurice_de_Berkeley,_2nd_Baron_Berkeley \"Maurice de Berkeley,\n2nd Baron Berkeley\"), and the majority of them reached\n[Carlisle](/wiki/Carlisle,_Cumbria \"Carlisle, Cumbria\").[9] Weighing up the\navailable evidence, Reese concludes that \"it seems doubtful if even a third of\nthe footsoldiers returned to England.\"[9] Out of 16,000 infantrymen, this\nwould give a total of about 11,000 killed. The English chronicler [Thomas\nWalsingham](/wiki/Thomas_Walsingham \"Thomas Walsingham\") gave the number of\nEnglish men-at-arms who were killed as 700,[7] while 500 more men-at-arms were\nspared for ransom.[30] The Scottish losses appear to have been comparatively\nlight, with only two knights among those killed.[31]\n\n##\nAftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\nThe defeat of the English opened up the north of England to Scottish raids[10]\nand allowed the [Scottish invasion of Ireland](/wiki/Bruce_campaign_in_Ireland\n\"Bruce campaign in Ireland\").[26] These finally led, after the failure of the\n[Declaration of Arbroath](/wiki/Declaration_of_Arbroath \"Declaration of\nArbroath\") to reach this end by diplomatic means, to the [Treaty of\nEdinburgh–Northampton](/wiki/Treaty_of_Edinburgh%E2%80%93Northampton \"Treaty\nof Edinburgh–Northampton\").[26] Under the treaty the English Crown recognised\nthe full [independence](/wiki/Independence \"Independence\") of the Kingdom of\nScotland, and acknowledged Robert the Bruce, and his heirs and successors, as\nthe rightful rulers.\n\n## Notable\ncasualties[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Notable casualties\")]\n\n###\nDeaths[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Deaths\")]\n\n  * [Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester](/wiki/Gilbert_de_Clare,_8th_Earl_of_Gloucester \"Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester\")\n  * Sir [Giles d'Argentan](/wiki/Giles_d%27Argentan \"Giles d'Argentan\")\n  * [John Lovel, 2nd Baron Lovel](/w/index.php?title=John_Lovel,_2nd_Baron_Lovel&action=edit&redlink=1 \"John Lovel, 2nd Baron Lovel \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n  * [John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch](/wiki/John_Comyn_\\(c._1294-1314\\) \"John Comyn \\(c. 1294-1314\\)\")\n  * [Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford](/wiki/Robert_de_Clifford,_1st_Baron_de_Clifford \"Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford\")\n  * Sir [Henry de Bohun](/wiki/Henry_de_Bohun \"Henry de Bohun\")\n  * [William le Marshal](/w/index.php?title=William_le_Marshal&action=edit&redlink=1 \"William le Marshal \\(page does not exist\\)\"), Marshal of Ireland\n  * [Edmund de Mauley](/w/index.php?title=Edmund_de_Mauley&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Edmund de Mauley \\(page does not exist\\)\"), [King's Steward](/wiki/Lord_Steward \"Lord Steward\")\n  * [Sir Robert de Felton](/w/index.php?title=Sir_Robert_de_Felton&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Sir Robert de Felton \\(page does not exist\\)\") of [Litcham](/wiki/Litcham \"Litcham\"), 1st Lord\n\n###\nCaptives[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Captives\")]\n\n  * [Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford](/wiki/Humphrey_de_Bohun,_4th_Earl_of_Hereford \"Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford\")\n  * [John Segrave, 2nd Baron Segrave](/wiki/John_Segrave,_2nd_Baron_Segrave \"John Segrave, 2nd Baron Segrave\")\n  * [Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley](/wiki/Maurice_de_Berkeley,_2nd_Baron_Berkeley \"Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley\")\n  * [Thomas de Berkeley](/wiki/Thomas_de_Berkeley,_1st_Baron_Berkeley \"Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley\")\n  * Sir [Marmaduke Tweng](/wiki/Marmaduke_Tweng \"Marmaduke Tweng\")\n  * [Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer](/wiki/Ralph_de_Monthermer,_1st_Baron_Monthermer \"Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer\")\n  * [Robert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus](/wiki/Robert_de_Umfraville,_Earl_of_Angus \"Robert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus\")\n  * Sir [Anthony de Luci](/wiki/Anthony_de_Luci \"Anthony de Luci\")\n  * Sir [Ingram de Umfraville](/wiki/Ingram_de_Umfraville \"Ingram de Umfraville\")\n  * Sir [John Maltravers, 1st Baron Maltravers](/wiki/John_Maltravers,_1st_Baron_Maltravers \"John Maltravers, 1st Baron Maltravers\")\n  * Sir [Thomas de Grey of Heaton](/wiki/Thomas_Grey_\\(of_Heaton\\) \"Thomas Grey \\(of Heaton\\)\")\n\n##\nLegacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Legacy\")]\n\n### Bannockburn Visitor\nCentre[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bannockburn&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Bannockburn Visitor Centre\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/MK18538_Bannockburn.jpg/220px-\nMK18538_Bannockburn.jpg)](/wiki/File:MK18538_Bannockburn.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MK18538_Bannockburn.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe hemicircle of the modern Bannockburn monument\n\nIn 1932 the Bannockburn Preservation Committee, under [Edward Bruce, 10th Earl\nof Elgin](/wiki/Edward_Bruce,_10th_Earl_of_Elgin \"Edward Bruce, 10th Earl of\nElgin\") and Kincardine, presented lands to the [National Trust for\nScotland](/wiki/National_Trust_for_Scotland \"National Trust for Scotland\").\nFurther lands were purchased in 1960 and 1965 to facilitate visitor access.
