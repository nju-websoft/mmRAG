This is shown by concept art\nwhere Obi-Wan Kenobi is shown alone in the Trade Federation flagship and while\nmeeting Jar Jar Binks. Even when Qui-Gon was conceived, Lucas toyed with\nmaking him the younger Jedi, as shown in concept art depicting Obi-Wan as an\nold man. Lucas originally envisioned an [American](/wiki/United_States \"United\nStates\") actor for the role of Qui-Gon, but ultimately cast [Northern\nIrish](/wiki/Northern_Irish_people \"Northern Irish people\") actor [Liam\nNeeson](/wiki/Liam_Neeson \"Liam Neeson\") because he considered Neeson to have\ngreat skills and presence, describing him as a \"master actor, who the other\nactors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the\ncharacter demands.\"[23] Initially, Lucas had planned for Qui-Gon to have long\nwhite hair, but that idea was scrapped and Qui-Gon is depicted as having long\nbrown hair in the film.\n\nDuring the early development of _[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the\nSith](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_III_-_Revenge_of_the_Sith \"Star Wars: Episode\nIII - Revenge of the Sith\")_ , Lucas wrote a scene featuring a ghostly Qui-Gon\nspeaking with [Yoda](/wiki/Yoda \"Yoda\") about Anakin. [Liam\nNeeson](/wiki/Liam_Neeson \"Liam Neeson\") was set to reprise his role, because\nhe hinted his possible appearance in the film.[24] However, the scene was\nfinally deleted from the film and Neeson was never recorded, although the\nscene was retained in the film's novelization.[25]\n\nThe character's name is derived from the Chinese word _[qigong](/wiki/Qigong\n\"Qigong\")_ (气功 or 氣功), a system of coordinated body movement, breathing, and\nmeditation used for health, spirituality, and martial arts training that\nallows access to higher realms of awareness, and balance of life energy,\nsimilar to [Tai chi](/wiki/Tai_chi \"Tai chi\"). This is paired with the Arabic\nword _[Jinn](/wiki/Jinn \"Jinn\")_ , meaning \"genie\" or \"tutelary spirit.\" The\nname translates almost literally as \"Guardian Spirit of the Living Force.\"[26]\n\"Jinn\" could also refer to the Chinese word for power, _jin_ (勁), and the\nmartial arts concept of _[fa jin](/wiki/Fa_jin \"Fa jin\")_ , which is the\nexplosive release of internal strength or power.[27]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Qui-Gon_Jinn&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Fuss, Kevin (May 25, 2011).
