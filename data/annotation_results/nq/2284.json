The neighborhood is infamously known as the location of a 70-acre (28\nha) landfill that became the epicenter of a massive environmental pollution\ndisaster harming the health of hundreds of residents[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_],\nculminating in an extensive [Superfund](/wiki/Superfund \"Superfund\") cleanup\noperation.\n\nOriginally intended as a model [planned community](/wiki/Planned_community\n\"Planned community\"), Love Canal served as a residential area before being\npurchased by [Hooker Chemical Company](/wiki/Hooker_Chemical_Company \"Hooker\nChemical Company\"), now, [Occidental Chemical\nCorporation](/wiki/Occidental_Chemical_Corporation \"Occidental Chemical\nCorporation\"). After its sale, under threat of eminent domain, to the [local\nschool district](/wiki/Niagara_Falls_City_School_District \"Niagara Falls City\nSchool District\"), Love Canal attracted national attention for the public\nhealth problem originated from the massive dumping of toxic waste on the\ngrounds. This event displaced numerous families, leaving them with long-\nstanding health issues and symptoms of high [white blood\ncell](/wiki/White_blood_cell \"White blood cell\") counts and\n[leukemia](/wiki/Leukemia \"Leukemia\"). Subsequently, the federal government\npassed the [Superfund](/wiki/Superfund \"Superfund\") law. The resulting\nSuperfund cleanup operation demolished the neighborhood, wrapping up in 2004.\n\n[New York State Health Department](/wiki/New_York_State_Department_of_Health\n\"New York State Department of Health\") Commissioner at the time, David\nAxelrod, called the Love Canal incident a \"national symbol of a failure to\nexercise a sense of concern for future generations\".[1] The Love Canal\nincident was especially significant as a situation where the inhabitants\n\"overflowed into the wastes instead of the other way around\".[2] The\nUniversity at Buffalo University Archives houses a number of primary\ndocuments, photographs, and news clippings pertaining to the Love Canal\nenvironmental disaster; many items have been digitized and are viewable\nonline.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Geography\n  * 2 Early history\n  * 3 Love Canal disaster\n    * 3.1 Pre-disaster state of town\n    * 3.2 Hooker Chemical Company\n    * 3.3 Sale of the site\n    * 3.4 Construction of the 93rd Street School and the 99th Street School\n    * 3.5 Usage by the schools\n    * 3.6 Leadup and Discovery\n      * 3.6.1 Contaminants\n    * 3.7 Consequences\n      * 3.7.1 Activism\n        * 3.7.1.1 Activism Tactics\n        * 3.7.1.2 Role of Community Organizations\n      * 3.7.2 Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association\n      * 3.7.3 Federal response\n      * 3.7.4 Health effects\n    * 3.8 Aftermath\n      * 3.8.1 Evacuation\n      * 3.8.2 Litigation and compensation\n      * 3.8.3 Remediation\n      * 3.8.4 Analysis\n    * 3.9 Conclusion\n    * 3.10 Controversies related to moved Love Canal waste and reports of illness\n  * 4 In popular culture\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Geography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Geography\")]\n\nLove Canal is a neighborhood located in the city of [Niagara\nFalls](/wiki/Niagara_Falls,_New_York \"Niagara Falls, New York\") in the\nnorthwestern region of [New York state](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\) \"New York\n\\(state\\)\"). The neighborhood covers 36 square blocks in the far southeastern\ncorner of the city, stretching from the 93rd street making up the western\nborder to the 100th street in the east border and the 103rd street in the\nnortheast. [Bergholtz\nCreek](/w/index.php?title=Bergholtz_Creek&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Bergholtz\nCreek \\(page does not exist\\)\") defines the north border with the [Niagara\nRiver](/wiki/Niagara_River \"Niagara River\") marking the southern border one-\nquarter mile (400 m) away. The [LaSalle Expressway](/wiki/LaSalle_Expressway\n\"LaSalle Expressway\") splits an uninhabited portion of the south from the\nnorth.[4] The canal covers 16 acres (6.5 ha) of land in the central eastern\nportion.[5]\n\n## Early history[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Early history\")]\n\nIn 1890, William T. Love, an ambitious entrepreneur from the [Western Railroad\nCorporation,](/w/index.php?title=Western_Railways_and_Light_Company&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Western Railways and Light Company \\(page does not exist\\)\") envisioned a\nperfect urban area called \"[Model City](/wiki/Model_City,_New_York \"Model\nCity, New York\")\". He prepared plans to construct a community of parks and\nresidences on the banks of [Lake Ontario](/wiki/Lake_Ontario \"Lake Ontario\"),\nbelieving it would serve the area's burgeoning industries with much-needed\nhydroelectricity.[6] He gave his name to the ensuing project, envisioning a\nperfect urban area.[7]\n\nAfter 1892, Love's plan incorporated a shipping lane that would bypass the\nNiagara Falls. Love quickly lined up backing from financial banks and giants\nin New York City, Chicago, and England. In October 1893, the first factory\nopened for business. In May 1894, work on the canal had begun. Steel companies\nand other manufacturers lined up for the chance of opening plants along the\nLove Canal.[8] He began digging the canal and built a few streets and\nhouses.[9] However, the [Panic of 1893](/wiki/Panic_of_1893 \"Panic of 1893\")\ncaused investors to drop sponsorship of the project.[10] In addition, Congress\npassed a law barring the removal of water from the Niagara River, to preserve\nNiagara Falls.[11] Only one mile (1.6 km) of the canal was dug, about 50 feet\n(15 m) wide and 10–40 feet (3–12 m) deep, stretching northward from the\n[Niagara River](/wiki/Niagara_River \"Niagara River\").[10][12]\n\nHowever, the [Panic of 1907](/wiki/Panic_of_1907 \"Panic of 1907\") proved\neconomically disastrous as Love had to abandon the project. The deathblow came\nwith the development of the transmission of electrical power economically over\ngreat distances by means of an alternating current. No longer was it necessary\nfor the industry to locate near the source of electrical power.\n\nLove's financial backers deserted him, and the last piece of the properties\nowned by his corporation was subjected to mortgage foreclosure and sold at\npublic auction in 1910.\n\nWith the project abandoned, the canal gradually filled with water.[9] The\nlocal children swam there in the summer and skated during the winter. In the\n1920s, the canal became a [dump site](/wiki/Dump_site \"Dump site\") for the\nCity of Niagara Falls, with the city regularly unloading its municipal refuse\ninto the landfill.\n\nIndustry and tourism grew steadily throughout the first half of the 20th\ncentury due to a high demand for industrial products and the increased\nmobility of people to travel. Paper, rubber, plastics, petrochemicals, carbon\ninsulators, and abrasives composed the city's major industries. This\nprosperity would end by the late 1960s as aging industrial plants moved to\nless expensive locations.\n\n## Love Canal\ndisaster[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Love Canal disaster\")]\n\n### Pre-disaster state of\ntown[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section:\nPre-disaster state of town\")]\n\nAt the time of the dump's closure in 1952, Niagara Falls was entering an\neconomic boom, and the population began expanding dramatically, growing by 33%\nin twenty years (1940-1960) from 78,020 to 102,394.[13]\n\n### Hooker Chemical\nCompany[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Hooker Chemical Company\")]\n\nBy the turn of the 1940s, [Hooker Chemical\nCompany](/wiki/Hooker_Chemical_Company \"Hooker Chemical Company\") was\nsearching for a place to dispose its large quantity of chemical waste. The\nNiagara Power and Development Company granted permission to Hooker in 1942 to\ndump wastes into the canal. The canal was drained and lined with thick clay.\nInto this site, Hooker began placing 55-US-gallon (210 l) [metal or fiber\nbarrels](/wiki/Drum_\\(container\\) \"Drum \\(container\\)\"). In 1947, Hooker\nbought the canal and the 70-foot-wide (21 m) banks on either side of the\ncanal.[14] It subsequently converted it into a 16-acre (6.5 ha) landfill.[15]\n\nIn 1948, the City of Niagara Falls ended self-sufficient disposal of refuse\nand Hooker Chemical became the sole user and owner of the site.\n\nIn early 1952, when it became apparent that the site would likely be developed\nfor construction, Hooker ceased use of Love Canal as a dumpsite.[16] During\nits 10-year lifespan, the landfill served as the dumping site of 21,800 short\ntons (19,800 t) of chemicals, mostly composed of products such as\n\"[caustics](/wiki/Corrosive_substance \"Corrosive substance\"),\n[alkalines](/wiki/Alkaline \"Alkaline\"), [fatty acid](/wiki/Fatty_acid \"Fatty\nacid\") and [chlorinated hydrocarbons](/wiki/Chlorinated_hydrocarbon\n\"Chlorinated hydrocarbon\") resulting from the manufacturing of dyes, perfumes,\nand solvents for rubber and synthetic resins\".[17][18] These chemicals were\nburied at a depth of twenty to twenty-five feet (6 to 7.5 m).[11] Upon its\nclosure, the canal was covered with a clay seal to prevent leakage. Over time,\nvegetation settled and began to grow atop the dump site.\n\nBy the 1950s, the city of Niagara Falls was experiencing a population boom.\nWith a growing population, the [Niagara Falls City School\nDistrict](/wiki/Niagara_Falls_City_School_District \"Niagara Falls City School\nDistrict\") needed land to build new schools and attempted to purchase the\nproperty from Hooker Chemical. The population reached over 98,000 by the 1950\ncensus.[19]\n\n### Sale of the\nsite[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section:\nSale of the site\")]\n\nIn March 1951, the school board prepared a plan showing a school being built\nover the canal and listing condemnation values for each property that would\nneed to be acquired.[20] In March 1952, the superintendent of [Niagara Falls\nSchool Board](/wiki/Niagara_Falls_City_School_District \"Niagara Falls City\nSchool District\") approached Hooker with regard to purchasing the Love Canal\nproperty for the purpose of constructing a new school. Following this initial\napproach, in an internal company memo dated March 27, 1952, Bjarne Klaussen,\nHooker's vice president, wrote to the works manager that \"it may be advisable\nto discontinue using the Love Canal property for a dumping ground.\"[16][21] In\nApril 1952, after discussing the sale of the land with Ansley Wilcox II,\nHooker's in-house legal counsel, Klaussen then wrote to the company president,\nR.L. Murray, suggesting that the sale could alleviate them from future\nliabilities for the buried chemicals:\n\n> The more we thought about it, the more interested Wilcox and I became in the\n> proposition, and finally came to the conclusion that the Love Canal property\n> is rapidly becoming a liability because of housing projects in the near\n> vicinity of our property. A school, however, could be built in the center\n> unfilled section (with chemicals underground). We became convinced that it\n> would be a wise move to turn this property over to the schools provided we\n> could not be held responsible for future claims or damages resulting from\n> underground storage of chemicals.[16][21]\n\nWhile the school board condemned some nearby properties, Hooker agreed to sell\nits property to the school board for $1. Hooker's letter to the board agreeing\nto enter into negotiations noted that \"in view of the nature of the property\nand the purposes for which it has been used, it will be necessary for us to\nhave special provisions incorporated into the deed with respect to the use of\nthe property and other pertinent matters.\" However, the board rejected the\ncompany's proposal that the deed requires the land to be used for park\npurposes only, with the school itself to be built nearby.[20]\n\nAs \"a means of avoiding liability by relinquishing control of the site\",\nHooker [deeded](/wiki/Deed \"Deed\") the site to the school board in 1953 for $1\nwith a liability limitation clause.[22] The sale document signed on April 28,\n1953, included a seventeen-line [caveat](/wiki/Caveat_emptor \"Caveat emptor\")\npurporting to release the company from all legal obligations should lawsuits\narise in the future.[16][17][20][23]\n\n> Prior to the delivery of this instrument of conveyance, the grantee herein\n> has been advised by the grantor that the premises above described have been\n> filled, in whole or in part, to the present grade level thereof with waste\n> products resulting from the manufacturing of chemicals by the grantor at its\n> plant in the City of Niagara Falls, New York, and the grantee assumes all\n> risk and liability incident to the use thereof. It is therefore understood\n> and agreed that, as a part of the consideration for this conveyance and as a\n> condition thereof, no claim, suit, action or demand of any nature whatsoever\n> shall ever be made by the grantee, its successors or assigns, against the\n> grantor, its successors or assigns, for injury to a person or persons,\n> including death resulting therefrom, or loss of or damage to property caused\n> by, in connection with or by reason of the presence of said industrial\n> wastes. It is further agreed as a condition hereof that each subsequent\n> conveyance of the aforesaid lands shall be made subject to the foregoing\n> provisions and conditions.[20]\n\nCritics of Hooker's actions believe that, in the words of Craig E. Colton and\nPeter N. Skinner, \"Hooker assigned the board with a continuing duty to protect\nproperty buyers from chemicals when the company itself accepted no such 'moral\nobligation'.\"[24] Moreover, the transfer effectively ended what provision of\nsecurity and maintenance for the hazardous waste had existed before and placed\nall responsibility in clearly unqualified hands. It was this attempt to evade\ntheir responsibility, Colten and Skinner contend, that would \"ultimately come\nback to haunt not only Hooker but all other chemical producers in the United\nStates through the strict liability provisions of Superfund legislation.\"[25]\nOn the other hand, Eric Zeusse writes that Hooker's decision to sell the\nproperty rather than allowing the school board to condemn it stemmed from a\ndesire to document its warnings. \"Had the land been condemned and seized, says\nHooker, the company would have been unable to air its concerns to all future\nowners of the property. It is difficult to see any other reason for what it\ndid.\"[20]\n\nNot long after having taken control of the land, the Niagara Falls School\nBoard proceeded to develop the land, including construction activity that\nsubstantially breached containment structures in a number of ways, allowing\npreviously trapped chemicals to seep out.\n\nThe resulting breaches combined with particularly heavy rainstorms released\nand spread the chemical waste, leading to a [public\nhealth](/wiki/Public_health \"Public health\") emergency and an [urban\nplanning](/wiki/Urban_planning \"Urban planning\") scandal. In what became a\ntest case for liability clauses, Hooker Chemical was found to be \"negligent\"\nin their disposal of waste, though not reckless in the sale of the land. The\ndumpsite was discovered and investigated by the local newspaper, the _[Niagara\nFalls Gazette](/wiki/Niagara_Gazette \"Niagara Gazette\")_ , from 1976 through\nthe evacuation in 1978.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Hooker_Electrochemical_Quit_Claim_Deed_to_Board_of_Education.pdf/page1-220px-\nHooker_Electrochemical_Quit_Claim_Deed_to_Board_of_Education.pdf.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hooker_Electrochemical_Quit_Claim_Deed_to_Board_of_Education.pdf)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hooker_Electrochemical_Quit_Claim_Deed_to_Board_of_Education.pdf\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nHooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education\n\n### Construction of the 93rd Street School and the 99th Street\nSchool[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Construction of the 93rd Street School and the 99th Street School\")]\n\nDespite the disclaimer, the School Board began construction of the \"99th\nStreet School\" in its originally intended location. In January 1954, the\nschool's architect wrote to the education committee informing them that during\nexcavation, workers discovered two dump sites filled with 55-US-gallon (210 l;\n46 imp gal) drums containing chemical wastes. The architect also noted it\nwould be \"poor policy\" to build in that area since it was not known what\nwastes were present in the ground, and the concrete\n[foundation](/wiki/Foundation_\\(engineering\\) \"Foundation \\(engineering\\)\")\nmight be damaged.[26] The school board then moved the school site eighty to\neighty-five feet (24 to 26 m) further north.[27] The kindergarten playground\nalso had to be relocated because it was directly on top of a chemical dump.\n\nUpon completion in 1955, 400 children attended the school, and it opened along\nwith several other schools that had been built to accommodate students. That\nsame year, a twenty-five-foot area crumbled exposing toxic chemical drums,\nwhich then filled with water during rainstorms. This created large puddles\nthat children enjoyed playing in.[27] In 1955, a second school, the 93rd\nStreet School, was opened six blocks away.\n\n### Usage by the\nschools[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Usage by the schools\")]\n\nIn 1957, the City of Niagara Falls constructed sewers for a mixture of low-\nincome and single family residences to be built on lands adjacent to the\nlandfill site. The school district had sold the remaining land, resulting in\nhomes constructed by private developers, as well as the Niagara Falls Housing\nAuthority. In total, 800 private houses and 240 low-income apartments were\nconstructed.[28] The sale came despite the warning of a Hooker attorney,\nArthur Chambers, that, as paraphrased in the minutes of a board meeting, \"due\nto chemical waste having been dumped in that area, the land was not suitable\nfor construction where underground facilities would be necessary. He stated\nthat his company could not prevent the Board from selling the land or from\ndoing anything they wanted to with it but, however, it was their intent that\nthis property be used for a school and for parking. He further stated that\nthey feel the property should not be divided for the purpose of building homes\nand hoped that no one will be injured.\"[29] While building the gravel sewer\nbeds, construction crews broke through the clay seal, breaching the canal\nwalls.[20] Specifically, the local government removed part of the protective\nclay cap to use as [fill dirt](/wiki/Fill_dirt \"Fill dirt\") for the nearby\n93rd Street School, and punched holes in the solid clay walls to build water\nlines and the [LaSalle Expressway](/wiki/LaSalle_Expressway \"LaSalle\nExpressway\"). This allowed the toxic wastes to escape when rainwater, no\nlonger kept out by the partially removed clay cap, washed them through the\ngaps in the walls.[30] Hence, the buried chemicals could migrate and\n[seep](/wiki/Soil_mechanics \"Soil mechanics\") from the canal.\n\nThe land where the homes were being built was not part of the agreement\nbetween the school board and Hooker; thus, none of these residents knew the\ncanal's history.[31] There was no monitoring or evaluating of the chemical\nwastes stored under the ground. Additionally, the clay cover of the canal\nwhich was supposed to be impermeable began to crack.[31] The subsequent\nconstruction of the [LaSalle Expressway](/wiki/LaSalle_Expressway \"LaSalle\nExpressway\") restricted [groundwater](/wiki/Groundwater \"Groundwater\") from\nflowing to the Niagara River. After the exceptionally wet winter and spring of\n1962, the elevated expressway turned the breached canal into an overflowing\npool. People reported having puddles of oil or colored liquid in yards or\nbasements.[32] There were 410 children in the school in 1978.[8]\n\n### Leadup and\nDiscovery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Leadup and Discovery\")]\n\nResidents were suspicious of black fluid that flowed out of the Love\nCanal.[33] For years, residents had complained about odors and substances on\ntheir yards or the public playgrounds. Finally the city acted and hired a\nconsultant, [Calspan Corporation](/wiki/Calspan \"Calspan\"), to do a massive\nstudy.[28] In 1977, a [harsh winter storm](/wiki/1977_Blizzard \"1977\nBlizzard\") dumped 33–45 inches (84–114 cm) of snow, significantly raising the\nwater table.[34][35] The excess water got into the ground water and raised the\nelevation of the dioxins, which began erupting in residents' backyards.[36] In\nthe spring of 1977, the State Departments of Health and Environmental\nConservation launched an intensive air, soil, and groundwater sampling and\nanalysis program following qualitative identification of a number of organic\ncompounds in the basements of 11 homes adjacent to the Love Canal. It was also\nrevealed that the standards at the time did not require the installation of a\nliner to prevent leaching; this became very common among companies.[37]\n\n#### Contaminants[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Contaminants\")]\n\nNumerous contaminants dumped in the landfill included chlorinated hydrocarbon\nresidues, processed sludge, [fly ash](/wiki/Fly_ash \"Fly ash\"), and other\nmaterials, including residential municipal garbage.[38]\n\nData showed unacceptable levels of toxic vapors associated with more than 80\ncompounds were emanating from the basements of numerous homes in the first\nring directly adjacent to the Love Canal. Ten of the most prevalent and most\ntoxic compounds - including benzene, a known human carcinogen - were selected\nfor evaluation purposes and as indicators of the presence of other chemical\nconstituents.[39]\n\nLaboratory analyses of soil and sediment samples from the Love Canal indicate\nthe presence of more than 200 distinct organic chemical compounds;\napproximately 100 of these have been identified to\ndate.[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_][40]\n\nNumerous other chemicals seeped through the ground.[41] Some of the chemicals\nand toxic materials found included benzene, chloroform, toluene, dioxin, and\nvarious kinds of PCB.\n\nType of Waste | Physical State | Total

Activism\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Love_Canal_protest.jpg/170px-\nLove_Canal_protest.jpg)](/wiki/File:Love_Canal_protest.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Love_Canal_protest.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA protest by Love Canal residents, ca. 1978.\n\nIn 1976, two reporters for the _[Niagara Falls Gazette](/wiki/Niagara_Gazette\n\"Niagara Gazette\")_ , David Pollak and David Russell, tested several [sump\npumps](/wiki/Sump_pump \"Sump pump\") near Love Canal and found toxic chemicals\nin them. The _Gazette_ published reports, once in October 1976 and once in\nNovember 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal\ndumpsite indicated presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic\nchlorinated hydrocarbons.[42] The matter went quiet for more than a year and\nwas resurrected by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential\nhealth effects by carrying forth an informal door-to-door survey in early\n1978, finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads,\nhands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group,\nwhich was led by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a\ndozen) birth defects. The New York State Health Department followed suit and\nfound an abnormal incidence of miscarriages.\n\nBy 1978, Love Canal had become a national media event with articles referring\nto the neighborhood as \"a public health time bomb\", and \"one of the most\nappalling environmental tragedies in American history\".[43] Brown, working for\nthe local newspaper, the _Niagara Gazette_ , is credited with not only\nbreaking open the case, but establishing toxic chemical wastes as a nationwide\nissue as well. Brown's book, _Laying Waste_ , examined the Love Canal disaster\nand many other toxic waste catastrophes nationwide.[44]\n\nThe dumpsite was declared an unprecedented state emergency on August 2, 1978.\nBrown, who wrote more than a hundred articles on the dump, tested the\ngroundwater and later found the dump was three times larger than originally\nthought, with possible ramifications beyond the original evacuation zone. He\nwas also to discover that highly toxic [dioxins](/wiki/Dioxins_and_dioxin-\nlike_compounds \"Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds\") were there.\n\n##### Activism\nTactics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Activism Tactics\")]\n\n_**[This section requires additional support and verification]**_ Activism at\nLove Canal was initially led by community residents Lois Gibbs and Tom Heiser,\nwith Lois Gibbs emerging as the \"face\" of the movement. Gibbs' strategies\nemphasized concerns for children and families of the affected area, with women\ntaking the most prominent public and active roles. Although women's activism\nat Love Canal was not explicitly linked to or directly informed by the wider\nwomen's movement of the time, resistance to change within the household led at\ntimes to strain within families. Many men also supported women in these\nefforts, though not always publicly. Men who were hesitant to oppose Hooker\nChemical openly for example, were able to contribute to the movement through\nincreased contributions to family labor in the absence of their activist\nwives.[45]\n\nIn addition to community organizing and pressuring authorities for appropriate\nresponses, direct-action forms of activism were employed. Tactics included\nprotests and rallies, which were intentionally timed and planned in an effort\nto maximize media attention. Such events included \"controversial\" methods such\nas mothers protesting while pushing strollers, marching by pregnant women, and\nchildren holding protest signs. Notably, two EPA employees were also held\nhostage by activists for approximately five hours at the LCHA office, in order\nto bring their demands to the attention of federal government.\n\n##### Role of Community\nOrganizations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Role of Community Organizations\")]\n\nNumerous organizations were formed in response to the crisis at Love Canal,\nwith members' activism emphasizing variously overlapping interests.[46] In\naddition to the Love Canal Homeowners Association\n([LCHA](/wiki/Love_Canal#Lois_Gibbs_and_the_Love_Canal_Homeowners'_Association\n\"Love Canal\")), other key organizations are the Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF),\nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the\nConcerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). These organizations are\noften overlooked in the story of Love Canal, according to research by\nElizabeth Blum in '['Love Canal\nRevisited'](https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html)'.\n\nThe Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF) was a religious organization comprised of\nvolunteers from the surrounding area _[verification and details required]_. In\nconjunction with other citizens' groups such as LCHA and LCARA, the ETF used\ntheir resources and platforms to promote environmental health and gender,\nclass, and racial equality.\n\nThe [NAACP](/wiki/NAACP \"NAACP\") became involved with the Love Canal issue\nafter William Abrams Sr., president of the Niagara Falls chapter drew concerns\nto his wife's fatal liver failure. Abrams involvement drew attention to racial\ninequality present in the community and concerns about how this could affect\ncomprehensive relocation efforts. Abrams contacted the regional NAACP director\nwho announced that discrimination against minorities at Love Canal would be\nmet with legal action. This involvement inspired additional support and\nactivism, particularly on behalf of members of the renting community, many of\nwhom were also members of the African-American and immigrant communities at\nthe site. _[this section needs clarification/support]_\n\nAnother subgroup of local residents formed the Love Canal Renters Association\n(CLCRA). This group's action sought to address the needs of the (largely, but\nnot exclusively, African-American) renter community, whose interests were at\ntimes perceived to be in conflict with those held by some members of the\n(predominantly white) property owners represented through the LCHA.\n\nIn 1980 [Lois Gibbs](/wiki/Lois_Gibbs \"Lois Gibbs\") established the Center for\nHealth, Environment, and Justice as a continuation of her activism at Love\nCanal.\n\n#### Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners'\nAssociation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association\")]\n\nOn August 2, 1978, [Lois Gibbs](/wiki/Lois_Gibbs \"Lois Gibbs\"), a local mother\nwho called an election to head the Love Canal Homeowners' Association, began\nto rally homeowners. Her son, Michael Gibbs, began attending school in\nSeptember 1977. He developed [epilepsy](/wiki/Epilepsy \"Epilepsy\") in\nDecember, suffered from [asthma](/wiki/Asthma \"Asthma\") and a [urinary tract\ninfection](/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection \"Urinary tract infection\"), and had a\nlow [white blood cell](/wiki/White_blood_cell \"White blood cell\")\ncount,[47][48] all associated with his exposure to the leaking chemical waste.\nGibbs had learned from Brown that her neighborhood sat atop the buried\nchemical waste.[49]\n\nIn the following years, Gibbs led an effort to investigate community concerns\nabout the health of its residents. She and other residents made repeated\ncomplaints of strange odors and \"substances\" that surfaced in their yards. In\nGibbs' neighborhood, there was a high rate of unexplained illnesses,\nmiscarriages, and intellectual disability.[10] Basements were often covered\nwith a thick, black substance, and vegetation was dying. In many yards, the\nonly vegetation that grew were shrubby grasses.[50] Although city officials\nwere asked to investigate the area, they did not act to solve the problem.\nNiagara Falls mayor Michael O'Laughlin infamously stated that there was\n\"nothing wrong\" in Love Canal.\n\nWith further investigation, Gibbs discovered the chemical danger of the\nadjacent canal. This began her organization's two-year effort to demonstrate\nthat the waste buried by Hooker Chemical was responsible for the health\nproblems of local residents. Throughout the ordeal, homeowners' concerns were\nignored not only by Hooker Chemical (now a subsidiary of [Occidental\nPetroleum](/wiki/Occidental_Petroleum \"Occidental Petroleum\")), but also by\nmembers of government. These parties argued that the area's endemic health\nproblems were unrelated to the toxic chemicals buried in the Canal. Since the\nresidents could not prove the chemicals on their property had come from\nHooker's disposal site, they could not prove [liability](/wiki/Legal_liability\n\"Legal liability\"). Throughout the legal battle, residents were unable to sell\ntheir properties and move away.\n\n#### Federal\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit\nsection: Federal response\")]\n\nOn August 7, 1978, United States President [Jimmy Carter](/wiki/Jimmy_Carter\n\"Jimmy Carter\") announced a federal health emergency, called for the\nallocation of federal funds, and ordered the Federal Disaster Assistance\nAgency to assist the City of Niagara Falls to remedy the Love Canal site.[51]\nThis was the first time in American history that emergency funds were used for\na situation other than a natural disaster.[52] Carter had trenches built that\nwould transport the wastes to sewers and had home [sump pumps](/wiki/Sump_pump\n\"Sump pump\") sealed off.[51]\n\n[Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") passed the\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act\n(CERCLA), better known as the [Superfund](/wiki/Superfund \"Superfund\") Act.\nLove Canal became the first entry on the list.[53] [CERCLA](/wiki/Superfund\n\"Superfund\") created a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries and\nprovided broad Federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened\nreleases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the\nenvironment. CERCLA also created a [National Priorities\nList](/wiki/National_Priorities_List \"National Priorities List\"), a shortened\nlist of the sites that has priority in cleanup. Love Canal was the first\nSuperfund site on that list. Eventually, the site was cleaned up and deleted\noff the list in 2004.[54] Because the Superfund Act contained a \"retroactive\nliability\" provision, Occidental was held liable for cleanup of the waste even\nthough it had followed all applicable U.S. laws when disposing of it.\n\n#### Health\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: Health effects\")]\n\nAt first, scientific studies did not conclusively prove the chemicals were\nresponsible for the residents' illnesses yet scientists were divided on the\nissue, even though eleven known or suspected [carcinogens](/wiki/Carcinogens\n\"Carcinogens\") had been identified, one of the most prevalent being\n[benzene](/wiki/Benzene \"Benzene\"). Also present was dioxin ([polychlorinated\ndibenzodioxins](/wiki/Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins \"Polychlorinated\ndibenzodioxins\")) in the water, a very hazardous substance. Dioxin pollution\nis usually measured in [parts per trillion](/wiki/Parts_per_trillion \"Parts\nper trillion\"); at Love Canal, water samples showed dioxin levels of 53 [parts\nper billion](/wiki/Parts_per_billion \"Parts per billion\").[51]\n[Geologists](/wiki/Geologist \"Geologist\") were recruited to determine whether\nunderground [swales](/wiki/Swale_\\(geographical_feature\\) \"Swale\n\\(geographical feature\\)\") were responsible for carrying the chemicals to the\nsurrounding residential areas. Once there, chemicals could\n[leach](/wiki/Soil_contamination \"Soil contamination\") into\n[basements](/wiki/Basement \"Basement\") and evaporate into [household\nair](/wiki/Indoor_air_quality \"Indoor air quality\").\n\nIn 1979, the EPA announced the result of [blood tests](/wiki/Blood_test \"Blood\ntest\") which showed high [white blood cell](/wiki/White_blood_cell \"White\nblood cell\") counts, a precursor to [leukemia](/wiki/Leukemia \"Leukemia\"),[43]\nand [chromosome](/wiki/Chromosome \"Chromosome\") damage in Love Canal\nresidents. 33% of the residents had undergone chromosomal damage. In a typical\npopulation, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people.[51] Other studies were\nunable to find harm.[55][56][57][58][59] The [United States National Research\nCouncil](/wiki/United_States_National_Research_Council \"United States National\nResearch Council\") (NRC) surveyed Love Canal health studies in 1991. The NRC\nnoted the major exposure of concern was the groundwater rather than drinking\nwater; the groundwater \"seeped into basements\" and then led to exposure\nthrough air and soil[60]:196 noted several studies reported higher levels of\nlow-birth weight babies and birth defects among the exposed\nresidents[60]:190–91 with some evidence the effect subsided after the exposure\nwas eliminated.[60]:165 The National Research Council also noted a study which\nfound exposed children were found to have an \"excess of seizures, learning\nproblems, hyperactivity, eye irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, and\nincontinence\" and stunted growth.[60]:196 [Voles](/wiki/Vole \"Vole\") in the\narea were found to have significantly increased mortality compared to controls\n(mean life expectancy in exposed animals \"23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively,\ncompared to 48.8 days\" for control animals).[60]:215 New York State also has\nan ongoing health study of Love Canal residents.[61] In that year, the Albert\nElia Building Co., Inc., now Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., was\nselected as the principal contractor to safely re-bury the toxic waste at the\nLove Canal Site.\n\nAccording to the [United States Environmental Protection\nAgency](/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency \"United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\") (EPA) in 1979, residents exhibited a\n\"disturbingly high rate of [miscarriages](/wiki/Miscarriage \"Miscarriage\") ...\nLove Canal can now be added to a growing list of environmental disasters\ninvolving toxics, ranging from industrial workers stricken by [nervous\ndisorders](/wiki/Anxiety_disorder \"Anxiety disorder\") and\n[cancers](/wiki/Cancer \"Cancer\") to the discovery of toxic materials in the\nmilk of nursing mothers.\" In one case, two out of four children in a single\nLove Canal family had [birth defects](/wiki/Congenital_disorder \"Congenital\ndisorder\"); one girl was born [deaf](/wiki/Hearing_impairment \"Hearing\nimpairment\") with a [cleft palate](/wiki/Cleft_palate \"Cleft palate\"), an\nextra row of teeth, and slight [retardation](/wiki/Mental_retardation \"Mental\nretardation\"), and a boy was born with an eye defect.[43]\n\n### Aftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Love_Canal_%285621742089%29.jpg/220px-\nLove_Canal_%285621742089%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Love_Canal_\\(5621742089\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Love_Canal_\\(5621742089\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLove Canal residents discuss revitalizing their contaminated neighborhood with\nEPA Administrator [Lee M. Thomas](/wiki/Lee_M._Thomas \"Lee M. Thomas\") in 1985\n\nWhen Eckhardt C. Beck (EPA Administrator for Region 2, 1977 – 1979) visited\nLove Canal in the late 1970s, he discerned the presence of toxic substances in\nthe community:\n\n> I visited the canal area at that time. Corroding waste-disposal drums could\n> be seen breaking up through the grounds of backyards. Trees and gardens were\n> turning black and dying. One entire swimming pool had been popped up from\n> its foundation, afloat now on a small sea of chemicals. Puddles of noxious\n> substances were pointed out to me by the residents. Some of these puddles\n> were in their yards, some were in their basements, others yet were on the\n> school grounds. Everywhere the air had a faint, choking smell. Children\n> returned from play with burns on their hands and faces.[43]\n\nRobert Whalen, then-New York's Health Commissioner, also visited Love Canal\nand believed that the Canal constituted an emergency, stating: \"Love Canal\nChemical Waste Landfill constitutes a public nuisance and an extremely serious\nthreat and danger to the health, safety and welfare of those using it, living\nnear it or exposed to the conditions emanating from it, consisting among other\nthings, of chemical wastes lying exposed on the surface in numerous places\npervasive, pernicious and obnoxious chemical vapors and fumes affecting both\nthe ambient air and the homes of certain residents living near such\nsites.\"[62] Whalen also instructed people to avoid going into their basements\nas well as to avoid fruits and vegetables grown in their gardens. People\nbecame very worried because many had consumed produce from their gardens for\nseveral years.[63] Whalen urged that all pregnant women and children under the\nage of two be removed from Love Canal as soon as possible.\n\nThe 99th Street School, on the other hand, was located within the former\nboundary of the Hooker Chemical landfill site. The school was closed and\ndemolished, but both the school board and the chemical company refused to\naccept liability. The 93rd Street School was closed some two years later\nbecause of concerns about seeping toxic waste.\n\n#### Evacuation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Evacuation\")]\n\nThe lack of public interest in Love Canal made matters worse for the\nhomeowners' association, which was opposed by two organizations that sought to\ndisprove negligence. Initially, members of the association had been frustrated\nby the lack of a public entity that could advise and defend them. Gibbs met\nwith public resistance from a number of residents within the community.\nEventually, the federal government relocated more than 800 families and\nreimbursed them for the loss of their homes. The state government and federal\ngovernment used $15 million to purchase 400 homes closest to Love Canal and\ndemolished several rings of houses.\n\n#### Litigation and\ncompensation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit\nsection: Litigation and compensation\")]\n\nIn 1994, Federal District Judge [John Curtin](/wiki/John_Thomas_Curtin \"John\nThomas Curtin\") ruled that Hooker/Occidental had been\n[negligent](/wiki/Negligence \"Negligence\"), but not reckless, in its handling\nof the waste and sale of the land to the [Niagara Falls School\nBoard](/wiki/Niagara_Falls_School_Board \"Niagara Falls School Board\").[64]\nCurtin's decision also contains a detailed history of events leading up to the\nLove Canal disaster. [Occidental Petroleum](/wiki/Occidental_Petroleum\n\"Occidental Petroleum\") was sued by the EPA and in 1995 agreed to pay $129\nmillion in restitution.[65] Out of that federal lawsuit came money for a small\nhealth fund and $3.5 million for the state health study.[66] Residents'\nlawsuits were also settled in the years following the Love Canal disaster.[67]\n\nThe Department of Justice published a report that noted the sites have been\nsuccessfully remediated is ready again for use. The Love Canal Area\nRevitalization Authority sold a few abandoned homes to private citizens.\nVirtually all remedial activities of the site, other than the operation of the\n[leachate](/wiki/Leachate \"Leachate\") collection system, were completed by\n1989.[66]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Abandoned_Streets_in_Love_Canal.jpg/220px-\nAbandoned_Streets_in_Love_Canal.jpg)](/wiki/File:Abandoned_Streets_in_Love_Canal.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Abandoned_Streets_in_Love_Canal.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAbandoned streets on the west side of Love Canal\n\n#### Remediation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Remediation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Looking_down_99th_Street_in_Love_Canal.jpg/220px-\nLooking_down_99th_Street_in_Love_Canal.jpg)](/wiki/File:Looking_down_99th_Street_in_Love_Canal.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Looking_down_99th_Street_in_Love_Canal.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLooking down 99th Street in Love Canal\n\nHouses in the residential areas on the east and west sides of the canal were\ndemolished. All that remains on the west side are abandoned residential\nstreets. Some older east side residents, whose houses stand alone in the\ndemolished neighborhood, chose to stay. It was estimated that fewer than 90 of\nthe original 900 families opted to remain.[51] They were willing to remain as\nlong as they were guaranteed that their homes were in a relatively safe\narea.[68] On June 4, 1980, the [state government](/wiki/Government_of_New_York\n\"Government of New York\") founded the Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency\n(LCARA) to restore the area. The area north of Love Canal became known as\nBlack Creek Village. LCARA wanted to resell 300 homes that had been bought by\nNew York when the residents were relocated.[68] The homes are farther away\nfrom where the chemicals were dumped. The most toxic area (16 acres (65,000\nm2)) was reburied with a thick plastic liner, clay and dirt. A 2.4-metre (7 ft\n10 in) high barbed wire fence was installed around the area.[69] It has been\ncalculated that 248 separate chemicals, including 60 kilograms (130 lb) of\ndioxin, have been unearthed from the canal.[69]\n\n#### Analysis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Analysis\")]\n\nIn 1998, Dr. [Elizabeth Whelan](/wiki/Elizabeth_Whelan \"Elizabeth Whelan\"),\nfounder of [American Council on Science and\nHealth](/wiki/American_Council_on_Science_and_Health \"American Council on\nScience and Health\"), wrote an editorial about the Canal in which she stated\nthat the media started calling the Canal a \"public health time bomb\", an\neditorial that created minor hysteria. She declared that people were not\nfalling ill because of exposure to chemical waste, but from stress caused by\nthe media.[69] Besides double the rate of birth defects to children born while\nliving on Love Canal, a follow-up study two decades after the incident \"showed\nincreased risks of low birth weight, congenital malformations and other\nadverse reproductive events\".[70] However, the same report found a slight\n_decrease_ in the incidence of cancer rates, and cautions, \"It is important\nnot to over emphasize any single finding but instead to search for\ninterpretable, coherent patterns of findings, since these are more likely to\nindicate valid and meaningful associations.\"[70]\n\nLove Canal, along with [Times Beach, Missouri](/wiki/Times_Beach,_Missouri\n\"Times Beach, Missouri\") and the [Valley of the Drums,\nKentucky](/wiki/Valley_of_the_Drums \"Valley of the Drums\"), are important in\n[United States environmental\nhistory](/wiki/Environmental_movement_in_the_United_States \"Environmental\nmovement in the United States\") as three sites that significantly contributed\nto the passing of the [CERCLA](/wiki/Superfund \"Superfund\"). Love Canal\n\"become the symbol for what happens when hazardous industrial products are not\nconfined to the workplace but 'hit people where they live' in inestimable\namounts\".[71]\n\nLove Canal was not an isolated case. Eckardt C. Beck suggested that there are\nprobably hundreds of similar dumpsites.[52] President Carter declared that\ndiscovering these dumpsites was \"one of the grimmest discoveries of the modern\nera\".[52] Had the residents of Love Canal been aware that they were residing\non toxic chemicals, most would not have moved there in the first place. Beck\nnoted that one main problem remains that ownership of such chemical companies\ncan change over the years, making liability difficult to assign (a problem\nthat would be addressed by CERCLA, or the Superfund Act).[52] Beck contended\nthat increased commitment was necessary to develop controls that would \"defuse\nfuture Love Canals\".[52]\n\nThe [free market environmentalist](/wiki/Free_market_environmentalist \"Free\nmarket environmentalist\") movement has often cited the Love Canal incident as\na consequence of government decision-makers not taking responsibility for\ntheir decisions. Stroup writes, \"The school district owning the land had a\nlaudable but narrow goal: it wanted to provide education cheaply for district\nchildren. Government decision makers are seldom held accountable for broader\nsocial goals in the way that private owners are by liability rules and\npotential profits.\"[30]\n\n### Conclusion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Conclusion\")]\n\nIn 2004, federal officials announced that the superfund cleanup has ended,\nalthough the actual cleanup ended years earlier.[72][73] The entire process\ntook 21 years and $400 million.[53] About 260 homes north of the canal have\nbeen renovated and sold to new owners, and about 150 acres (61 ha) east of the\ncanal have been sold to commercial developers for light industrial uses. In\ntotal, 950 families had been evacuated. The site was removed from the\nSuperfund list.\n\n### Controversies related to moved Love Canal waste and reports of\nillness[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit\nsection: Controversies related to moved Love Canal waste and reports of\nillness\")]\n\nThe Niagara Sanitation landfill covers 18.7 acres (7.6 ha) in [Wheatfield, New\nYork](/wiki/Wheatfield,_New_York \"Wheatfield, New York\"). The state Department\nof Transportation moved approximately 1,600 cubic yards (1,200 m3) of material\nfrom the Love Canal landfill to Niagara Sanitation. Residents of [North\nTonawanda](/wiki/North_Tonawanda \"North Tonawanda\") and Wheatfield suffering\nsevere health problems say the waste was subsequently disturbed during the\nconstruction of the LaSalle Expressway in Niagara Falls. The New York\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation (DEC) contends there is no proof the\nlandfill leaks. A lawsuit asserts that Hooker’s creation of a brine pipeline\nalong the edge of the landfill used to move brine from Wyoming County to its\nNiagara Falls plant location, may have created a conduit for the landfilled\nwaste to leak out.[74]\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit\nsection: In popular culture\")]\n\nThe legacy of the disaster inspired a fictionalized 1982 made-for-TV film\nentitled _Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal_. An award-winning documentary by\n[Lynn Corcoran](/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Corcoran&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Lynn\nCorcoran \\(page does not exist\\)\") entitled _[In Our Own\nBackyard](/w/index.php?title=In_Our_Own_Backyard&action=edit&redlink=1 \"In Our\nOwn Backyard \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ was released in the U.S. in 1983.[75]\n_[Modern Marvels](/wiki/Modern_Marvels \"Modern Marvels\")_ retold the disaster\nin 2004.[76]\n\n[Joyce Carol Oates](/wiki/Joyce_Carol_Oates \"Joyce Carol Oates\") included the\nstory of Love Canal in her 2004 novel _[The\nFalls](/wiki/The_Falls_\\(Oates_novel\\) \"The Falls \\(Oates novel\\)\")_ , but\nchanged the time period of the disaster to the 1960s. The latest history of\nLove Canal, _Love Canal: A Toxic History From Colonial Times To The Present_ ,\nwritten by Richard S. Newman, was published by Oxford University Press in\n2016.\n\nThe film _[Tootsie](/wiki/Tootsie \"Tootsie\")_ has a character attempting to\nproduce a play called \"Return To Love Canal\". In response to the pitch for the\nplay, [Sydney Pollack](/wiki/Sydney_Pollack \"Sydney Pollack\") tells [Dustin\nHoffman](/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman \"Dustin Hoffman\") that \"Nobody wants to produce\na play about a couple that moved back to Love Canal. Nobody wants to pay\ntwenty dollars to see people living next to chemical waste. They can see that\nin [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey \"New Jersey\").\"[77]\n\n\"Love Canal\" was also a segment in the premiere episode of [Michael\nMoore](/wiki/Michael_Moore \"Michael Moore\")'s TV series _[TV\nNation](/wiki/TV_Nation \"TV Nation\")_ , which featured realtors attempting to\nlure prospective residents to the area.\n\nIn the 1998 [First-person shooter](/wiki/First-person_shooter \"First-person\nshooter\") [video game](/wiki/Video_game \"Video game\"), _[Blood II: The\nChosen](/wiki/Blood_II:_The_Chosen \"Blood II: The Chosen\")_ , the sixth level\nof the second episode, which takes place in part of the water system of a\nhousing project built by the villains over a pit of radioactive waste, is\ncalled \"Love Canal\" in reference to the disaster.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [102nd Street chemical landfill](/wiki/102nd_Street_chemical_landfill \"102nd Street chemical landfill\"), a landfill located immediately to the south of Love Canal.\n  * [Cancer Alley](/wiki/Cancer_Alley \"Cancer Alley\") (in Louisiana)\n  * [Landfills in the United States](/wiki/Landfills_in_the_United_States \"Landfills in the United States\")\n  * [Spring Valley, Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Spring_Valley,_Washington,_D.C. \"Spring Valley, Washington, D.C.\")\n  * [Times Beach, Missouri](/wiki/Times_Beach,_Missouri \"Times Beach, Missouri\")\n  * [Valley of the Drums](/wiki/Valley_of_the_Drums \"Valley of the Drums\")\n  * [Centralia, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Centralia,_Pennsylvania \"Centralia, Pennsylvania\") and its [mine fire](/wiki/Centralia_mine_fire \"Centralia mine fire\")\n  * [William Ginsberg](/wiki/William_Ginsberg \"William Ginsberg\"), member of New York State task force investigating Love Canal in 1979, and author of state report.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_Canal&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n**Notes**\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Verhovek, Sam How (August 5, 1988).
