A 2006 Census Bureau estimate put the population at 66,217,736.\nThe United States Census Bureau divides this region into the East North\nCentral States (essentially the [Great Lakes](/wiki/Great_Lakes \"Great Lakes\")\nStates) and the West North Central States.\n\n[Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\") is the largest city in the region, followed\nby [Indianapolis](/wiki/Indianapolis \"Indianapolis\") and\n[Columbus](/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio \"Columbus, Ohio\").

Another term\nsometimes applied to the same general region is \"the heartland\". Other\ndesignations for the region have fallen into disuse, such as the \"Northwest\"\nor \"Old Northwest\" (from \"Northwest Territory\") and \"Mid-America\". Since the\nbook _[Middletown](/wiki/Middletown_studies \"Middletown studies\")_ appeared in\n1929, [sociologists](/wiki/Sociologists \"Sociologists\") have often used\nMidwestern cities (and the Midwest generally) as \"typical\" of the entire\nnation. The region has a higher [employment-to-population\nratio](/wiki/Employment-to-population_ratio \"Employment-to-population ratio\")\n(the percentage of employed people at least 16 years old) than the Northeast,\nthe West, the South, or the Sun Belt states.\n\nFour of the states associated with the Midwestern United States\n([Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\"), [Nebraska](/wiki/Nebraska
