She lives alone in an apartment above a cinema, and works as a\ncleaning woman at a secret government laboratory in\n[Baltimore](/wiki/Baltimore \"Baltimore\") at the height of the [Cold\nWar](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\"). Her friends are her [closeted](/wiki/Closeted\n\"Closeted\") next-door neighbor Giles, a struggling advertising illustrator who\nshares a strong bond with her, and her African-American co-worker Zelda, a\nwoman who also serves as her interpreter at work.\n\nThe facility receives a mysterious creature captured from a South American\nriver by Colonel Richard Strickland, who is in charge of the project to study\nit. Curious about the creature, Elisa discovers it is a humanoid amphibian.\nShe begins visiting him in secret, and the two form a close bond.\n\nSeeking to exploit the creature to American advantage in the [Space\nRace](/wiki/Space_Race \"Space Race\"), General Frank Hoyt orders Strickland to\n[vivisect](/wiki/Vivisection \"Vivisection\") it. One scientist, Robert\nHoffstetler—who is in truth a [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") spy\nnamed Dimitri Mosenkov—pleads unsuccessfully to keep the creature alive for\nfurther study and, at the same time, is ordered by his Soviet handlers to\neuthanize the creature. When Elisa learns of the Americans' plans for the\ncreature, she persuades Giles to help her free him. Mosenkov discovers Elisa's\nplot and chooses to help her. Though initially reluctant, Zelda becomes\ninvolved in the escape, and it is successful.\n\nElisa keeps the creature in her bathtub, adding salt to the water to keep him\nalive. She plans to release the creature into a nearby canal when it will be\nopened to the ocean in several days' time. As part of his efforts to recover\nthe creature, Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, but the failure of his\nadvances toward Elisa hampers his judgment, and he dismisses them. Back at the\napartment, Giles discovers the creature devouring one of his cats, Pandora.\nStartled, the creature slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment.\nThe creature gets as far as the cinema downstairs before Elisa finds him and\nreturns him to her apartment. The creature touches Giles on his balding head\nand his wounded arm; the next morning, Giles discovers his hair has begun\ngrowing back and the wounds on his arm have healed. Elisa and the creature\nsoon become romantically involved, having sex in her bathroom, which she at\none point fills completely with water.\n\nHoyt gives Strickland an ultimatum, asking him to recover the creature within\n36 hours. Meanwhile, Mosenkov is told by his handlers that he will be\nextracted in two days. As the planned release date approaches, the creature's\nhealth starts deteriorating. Mosenkov leaves to rendezvous with his handlers,\nwith Strickland tailing him. At the rendezvous, Mosenkov is shot by one of his\nhandlers, but Strickland shoots the handlers dead and then tortures Mosenkov\nfor information. Mosenkov implicates Elisa and Zelda before dying from his\nwounds. Strickland then threatens Zelda in her home, causing her terrified\nhusband to reveal that Elisa had been keeping the creature. Strickland\nsearches Elisa's apartment and finds a calendar note revealing when and where\nshe plans to release him.\n\nAt the canal, Elisa and Giles bid farewell to the creature, but Strickland\narrives and attacks them all. Strickland knocks Giles down and shoots the\ncreature and Elisa, who both appear to die. However, the creature heals\nhimself and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As police arrive on the\nscene with Zelda, the creature takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, where,\ndeep under water, he heals her. When he applies his healing touch to the scars\non her neck, they open to reveal [gills](/wiki/Gill \"Gill\") like his. In a\nclosing voice-over narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived\n\"happily ever after\" with the creature.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Shape_of_Water&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Sally Hawkins](/wiki/Sally_Hawkins \"Sally Hawkins\") as Elisa Esposito, a [mute](/wiki/Muteness \"Muteness\") cleaner who works at a secret government laboratory.\n  * [Michael Shannon](/wiki/Michael_Shannon \"Michael Shannon\") as Richard Strickland, a [United States Colonel](/wiki/Colonel_\\(United_States\\) \"Colonel \\(United States\\)\") in charge of the project to study the \"asset\".\n  * [Richard Jenkins](/wiki/Richard_Jenkins \"Richard Jenkins\") as Giles, Elisa's neighbor and close friend who is a struggling advertising [illustrator](/wiki/Illustrator \"Illustrator\").\n  * [Octavia Spencer](/wiki/Octavia_Spencer \"Octavia Spencer\") as Zelda Delilah Fuller, Elisa's African-American co-worker and friend who serves as her [interpreter](/wiki/Interpreter \"Interpreter\").\n  * [Michael Stuhlbarg](/wiki/Michael_Stuhlbarg \"Michael Stuhlbarg\") as Robert Hoffstetler / Dimitri Mosenkov, a Soviet spy working as a scientist studying the creature under an alias.\n  * [Doug Jones](/wiki/Doug_Jones_\\(actor\\) \"Doug Jones \\(actor\\)\") as \"Amphibian Man\", an amphibious creature referred to as the \"asset\", with whom Elisa forms a close bond.\n  * [David Hewlett](/wiki/David_Hewlett \"David Hewlett\") as Fleming, the laboratory's head of security.\n  * [Nick Searcy](/wiki/Nick_Searcy \"Nick Searcy\") as Frank Hoyt, a [United States General](/wiki/General_\\(United_States\\) \"General \\(United States\\)\") who is Strickland's superior.\n  * Stewart Arnott as Bernard, Giles' employer and former lover.\n  * [Nigel Bennett](/wiki/Nigel_Bennett \"Nigel Bennett\") as Mihalkov, Mosenkov's handler.\n  * [Lauren Lee Smith](/wiki/Lauren_Lee_Smith \"Lauren Lee Smith\") as Elaine Strickland, Strickland's wife.\n  * Martin Roach as Brewster Fuller, Zelda's husband.\n  * Allegra Fulton as Yolanda, a cleaning woman at the laboratory.\n  * [John Kapelos](/wiki/John_Kapelos \"John Kapelos\") as Mr. Arzoumanian, the owner of the cinema who resided below Elisa and Giles' apartments.\n  * [Morgan Kelly](/wiki/Morgan_Kelly \"Morgan Kelly\") as Pie Guy, a diner employee to whom Giles is attracted.\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Shape_of_Water&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n[![\\[icon\\]](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-\nWiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg)| **This\nsection needs expansion**.

It won in four categories: [Best Production\nDesign](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Production_Design \"Academy Award for Best\nProduction Design\"), [Best Original\nScore](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score \"Academy Award for Best\nOriginal Score\"), [Best Director](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director\n\"Academy Award for Best Director\"), and [Best\nPicture](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture \"Academy Award for Best\nPicture\").\n\nThe film also spawned some debate about whether the fact that it was filmed in\nCanada, with a predominantly Canadian crew and many Canadian actors in the\nsupporting roles, should have made it eligible to be nominated for the\n[Canadian Screen Awards](/wiki/Canadian_Screen_Awards \"Canadian Screen\nAwards\"). Under [Academy of Canadian Cinema and\nTelevision](/wiki/Academy_of_Canadian_Cinema_and_Television \"Academy of\nCanadian Cinema and Television\") rules, to qualify for CSA nominations under\nthe rules for international coproductions at least 15 per cent of a film's\nfunding must come from a Canadian film studio.

I'd never heard of this play before making _The Shape of\nWater,_ and none of my collaborators ever mentioned the play.\" Distributor\n[Fox Searchlight](/wiki/Fox_Searchlight \"Fox Searchlight\") also denied the\nclaim and said that it would \"vigorously defend\" itself in court.[46]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Shape_of_Water&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [\"The Shape of Water\"](http://www.tiff.net/tiff/film.html?v=the-shape-of-water).
