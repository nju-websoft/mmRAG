Discussions have faltered\nover similar points as the [Doha Development\nRound](/wiki/Doha_Development_Round \"Doha Development Round\") of [World Trade\nOrganization](/wiki/World_Trade_Organization \"World Trade Organization\") (WTO)\ntalks; developed nations seek expanded trade in\n[services](/wiki/Service_Sector \"Service Sector\") and increased [intellectual\nproperty](/wiki/Intellectual_property \"Intellectual property\") rights, while\nless developed nations seek an end to [agricultural\nsubsidies](/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy \"Agricultural subsidy\") and free trade\nin agricultural goods. Similar to the WTO talks, Brazil has taken a leadership\nrole among the less developed nations, while the United States has taken a\nsimilar role for the developed nations.\n\n###\nBeginning[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Free_Trade_Area_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Beginning\")]\n\nFree Trade Area of the Americas began with the [Summit of the\nAmericas](/wiki/Summit_of_the_Americas \"Summit of the Americas\") in Miami,\nFlorida, on December 11, 1994, but the FTAA came to public attention during\nthe [Quebec City Summit of the\nAmericas](/wiki/Quebec_City_Summit_of_the_Americas \"Quebec City Summit of the\nAmericas\"), held in Canada in 2001, a meeting targeted by massive [anti-\ncorporatization](/wiki/Anti-corporatization \"Anti-corporatization\") and [anti-\nglobalization](/wiki/Anti-globalization \"Anti-globalization\") protests. The\nMiami negotiations in 2003 met similar protests, though perhaps not as large.\n\n###\nDisagreements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Free_Trade_Area_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Disagreements\")]\n\nIn previous negotiations, the United States had pushed for a single\ncomprehensive agreement to reduce trade barriers for goods, while increasing\nintellectual property protection. Specific intellectual property protections\ncould include [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](/wiki/DMCA \"DMCA\")-style\ncopyright protections similar to the [U.S.-Australia Free Trade\nAgreement](/wiki/U.S.-Australia_Free_Trade_Agreement \"U.S.-Australia Free\nTrade Agreement\"). Another protection would likely restrict the reimportation\nor cross-importation of pharmaceuticals, similar to the proposed agreement\nbetween the United States and Canada. Brazil proposed a three-track approach\nthat calls for a series of bilateral agreements to reduce specific tariffs on\ngoods, a hemispheric pact on [rules of origin](/wiki/Rules_of_origin \"Rules of\norigin\"), and a dispute resolution process; Brazil proposed to omit the more\ncontroversial issues from the FTAA, leaving them to the WTO.\n\nThe location of the FTAA Secretariat was to have been determined in 2005. The\ncontending cities are: [Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia \"Atlanta, Georgia\"),\n[Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\"), [Galveston](/wiki/Galveston,_Texas\n\"Galveston, Texas\"), [Houston](/wiki/Houston,_Texas \"Houston, Texas\"), [San\nJuan](/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico \"San Juan, Puerto Rico\"), and\n[Miami](/wiki/Miami \"Miami\") in the United States; [Cancún](/wiki/Canc%C3%BAn\n\"Cancún\") and [Puebla](/wiki/Puebla,_Puebla \"Puebla, Puebla\") in Mexico;\n[Panama City](/wiki/Panama_City \"Panama City\"), Panama; and [Port of\nSpain](/wiki/Port_of_Spain \"Port of Spain\"), [Trinidad and\nTobago](/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago \"Trinidad and Tobago\"). The U.S. city of\n[Colorado Springs](/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado \"Colorado Springs,\nColorado\") also submitted its candidacy in the early days but subsequently\nwithdrew.[2] Miami, Panama City and Puebla served successively as interim\nsecretariat headquarters during the negotiation process.\n\nThe last summit was held at [Mar del Plata](/wiki/Mar_del_Plata \"Mar del\nPlata\"), Argentina, in November 2005, but no agreement on FTAA was reached. Of\nthe 34 countries present at the negotiations, 26 pledged to meet again in 2006\nto resume negotiations, but no such meeting took place. The failure of the Mar\ndel Plata summit to establish a comprehensive FTAA agenda augured poorly.\n\n### Current\nstatus[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Free_Trade_Area_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Current status\")]\n\n![Ambox current red.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Ambox_current_red.svg/42px-Ambox_current_red.svg.png) | This article needs to be **updated**.

The leaders however, planned\nfurther discussions at the Sixth [Summit of the\nAmericas](/wiki/Summit_of_the_Americas \"Summit of the Americas\") in Cartagena,\nColombia, in

and\nopposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Free_Trade_Area_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Support and opposition\")]\n\nA vocal critic of the FTAA was Venezuelan president [Hugo\nChávez](/wiki/Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez \"Hugo Chávez\"), who has described it as an\n\"[annexation](/wiki/Annexation \"Annexation\") plan\" and a \"tool of\n[imperialism](/wiki/Imperialism \"Imperialism\")\" for the exploitation of Latin\nAmerica.[7] As a counterproposal to this initiative, Chávez promoted the\n[Bolivarian Alliance for the\nAmericas](/wiki/Bolivarian_Alliance_for_the_Americas \"Bolivarian Alliance for\nthe Americas\") (_Alianza Bolivariana para las Américas_ , ALBA), based mostly\non the model of the [Eurasian Economic\nCommunity](/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Community \"Eurasian Economic Community\"),\nwhich emphasizes energy and infrastructure agreements that are gradually\nextended to other areas finally to include the total economic, political and\nmilitary integration of the member states.[7] [Evo Morales](/wiki/Evo_Morales\n\"Evo Morales\") of Bolivia has referred to the U.S.-backed Free Trade Area of\nthe Americas, as \"an agreement to legalize the colonization of the\nAmericas\".[8]\n\nOn the other hand, the then presidents of Brazil, [Luiz Inácio Lula da\nSilva](/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva \"Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva\"), and\nArgentina, [Néstor Kirchner](/wiki/N%C3%A9stor_Kirchner \"Néstor Kirchner\"),\nhave stated that they do not oppose the FTAA but they do demand that the\nagreement provide for the elimination of U.S. agriculture\n[subsidies](/wiki/Subsidy \"Subsidy\"), the provision of effective access to\nforeign markets and further consideration towards the needs and sensibilities\nof its members.[9]\n\nOne of the most contentious issues of the treaty proposed by the United States\nis with concerns to [patents](/wiki/Patent \"Patent\") and\n[copyrights](/wiki/Copyright \"Copyright\"). Critics claim that if the measures\nproposed by the United States were implemented and applied this would reduce\nscientific research in Latin America. On the [left-wing](/wiki/Left-wing\n\"Left-wing\") [Council of Canadians](/wiki/Council_of_Canadians \"Council of\nCanadians\") web site, Barlow wrote: \"This agreement sets enforceable global\nrules on patents, copyrights and trademark. It has gone far beyond its initial\nscope of protecting original inventions or cultural products and now permits\nthe practice of patenting plants and animal forms as well as seeds. It\npromotes the private rights of corporations over local communities and their\ngenetic heritage and traditional medicines\".[10]\n\nOn the weekend of April 20, 2001, the [3rd Summit of the\nAmericas](/wiki/3rd_Summit_of_the_Americas \"3rd Summit of the Americas\") was a\n[summit](/wiki/Summit_\\(meeting\\) \"Summit \\(meeting\\)\") held in [Quebec\nCity](/wiki/Quebec_City \"Quebec City\"), Canada. This international meeting was\na round of negotiations regarding a proposed FTAA.\n\n##\nAgreements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Free_Trade_Area_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Agreements\")]\n\nThere are currently 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere, stretching from\nCanada to Chile that still have the FTAA as a long term goal.[11] The\nImplementation of a full multilateral FTAA between all parties could be made\npossible by enlargement of existing agreements. North America, with the\nexception of Cuba and Haiti (which has participated in economic integration\nwith the [Caricom](/wiki/Caricom \"Caricom\") since 2002)[12][13] has come close\nto setting up a subcontinental free trade area.
