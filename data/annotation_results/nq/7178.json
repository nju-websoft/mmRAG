Cores to accommodate holes can be seen in the bottom half of the\nmould, which is called the _drag_. The top half of the mould is called the\n_cope_.\n\nIn [casting](/wiki/Casting \"Casting\"), a **pattern** is a replica of the\nobject to be cast, used to prepare the cavity into which molten material will\nbe poured during the casting process.[1][2]\n\nPatterns used in [sand casting](/wiki/Sand_casting \"Sand casting\") may be made\nof wood, metal, plastics or other materials. Patterns are made to exacting\nstandards of construction, so that they can last for a reasonable length of\ntime, according to the quality grade of the pattern being built, and so that\nthey will repeatably provide a dimensionally acceptable casting.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Patternmaking\n  * 2 Materials used\n  * 3 Design\n    * 3.1 Sprues, gates, risers, cores, and chills\n  * 4 Types of Patterns\n  * 5 Allowances\n    * 5.1 Contraction allowance / Shrinkage allowance\n    * 5.2 Draft allowance\n    * 5.3 Finishing or Machining allowance\n    * 5.4 Shake allowance\n    * 5.5 Distortion allowance\n  * 6 Demand\n  * 7 References\n\n##\nPatternmaking[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Patternmaking\")]\n\nThe making of patterns, called **patternmaking** (sometimes styled **pattern-\nmaking** or **pattern making**), is a skilled trade that is related to the\ntrades of [tool and die making](/wiki/Tool_and_die_maker \"Tool and die maker\")\nand [moldmaking](/wiki/Moldmaker \"Moldmaker\"), but also often incorporates\nelements of [fine woodworking](/wiki/Woodworking \"Woodworking\").\n**Patternmakers** (sometimes styled **pattern-makers** or **pattern makers**)\nlearn their skills through apprenticeships and trade schools over many years\nof experience. Although an engineer may help to design the pattern, it is\nusually a patternmaker who executes the design[4]\n\n## Materials\nused[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Materials used\")]\n\nTypically, materials used for pattern making are wood, metal or plastics.\n[Wax](/wiki/Wax \"Wax\") and [Plaster of Paris](/wiki/Plaster_of_Paris \"Plaster\nof Paris\") are also used, but only for specialized applications. Sugar pine is\nthe most commonly used material for patterns, primarily because it is soft,\nlight, and easy to work. Honduras Mahogany was used for more production parts\nbecause it is harder and would last longer than pine. Once properly cured it\nis about as stable as any wood available, not subject to warping or curling.\nOnce the pattern is built the foundry does not want it changing shape. True\nHonduras Mahogany is harder to find now because of the decimation of the rain\nforests, so now there are a variety of woods marketed as Mahogany. Fiberglass\nand plastic patterns have gained popularity in recent years because they are\nwater proof and very durable. Metal patterns are long lasting and do not\nsuccumb to moisture, but they are heavier, more expensive and difficult to\nrepair once damaged.[5]\n\nWax patterns are used in a casting process called [investment\ncasting](/wiki/Investment_casting \"Investment casting\"). A combination of\n[paraffin wax](/wiki/Paraffin_wax \"Paraffin wax\"), [bees wax](/wiki/Bees_wax\n\"Bees wax\") and [carnauba wax](/wiki/Carnauba_wax \"Carnauba wax\") is used for\nthis purpose.[5]\n\nPlaster of paris is usually used in making master dies and molds, as it gains\nhardness quickly, with a lot of flexibility when in the setting stage.[5]\n\n## Design[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Design\")]\n\n### Sprues, gates, risers, cores, and\nchills[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Sprues, gates, risers, cores, and chills\")]\n\nThe patternmaker or foundry engineer decides where the\n_[sprues](/wiki/Sprue_\\(molding\\) \"Sprue \\(molding\\)\")_ , _gating_ systems,\nand _[risers](/wiki/Riser_\\(casting\\) \"Riser \\(casting\\)\")_ are placed with\nrespect to the pattern. Where a hole is desired in a casting, a\n_[core](/wiki/Core_\\(manufacturing\\) \"Core \\(manufacturing\\)\")_ may be used\nwhich defines a volume or location in a casting where metal will not flow\ninto. Sometimes _chills_ may be placed on a pattern surface prior to molding,\nwhich are then formed into the sand mould. Chills are heat sinks which enable\nlocalized rapid cooling. The rapid cooling may be desired to refine the grain\nstructure or determine the freezing sequence of the molten metal which is\npoured into the mould. Because they are at a much cooler temperature, and\noften a different metal than what is being poured, they do not attach to the\ncasting when the casting cools. The chills can then be reclaimed and reused.\n\nThe design of the feeding and gating system is usually referred to as\n_methoding_ or _methods design_. It can be carried out manually, or\ninteractively using general-purpose CAD software, or semi-automatically using\nspecial-purpose software (such as [AutoCAST](/wiki/AutoCAST \"AutoCAST\"))\n\n## Types of\nPatterns[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Types of Patterns\")]\n\nPatterns are made of wood, metal, ceramic, or hard plastics and vary in\ncomplexity.\n\nA single piece pattern, or loose pattern, is the simplest. It is a replica of\ndinasour the desired casting—usually in a slightly extra larger size to offset\nthe shrinkage of the intended metal. Gated patterns connect a number of loose\npatterns together with a series of runners that will be detached after shake-\nout. Segmented or multi-piece patterns create a casting in several pieces to\nbe joined in post-processing.\n\nMatch plate patterns are patterns with the top and bottom parts of the\npattern, also known as the cope and drag portions, mounted on opposite sides\nof a board. This adaptation allows patterns to be quickly pressed into the\nmolding material. A similar technique called a cope and drag pattern is often\nused for large castings or large production runs: in this variation, the two\nsides of the pattern are mounted on separate pattern plates that can be hooked\nup to horizontal or vertical machines and pressed into the molding material.\nWhen the parting lines between the cope and drag are irregular, a follow board\ncan be used to support irregularly shaped, loose patterns.\n\nSweep patterns are used for symmetric molds and casting, which are counter\nstrikes shapes rotated around a center axis or pole snooker through the\nmolding material. A sweep pattern is a form of skeleton pattern: any\ngeometrical pattern that creates a mold by being moved through the molding\nmaterial.[6]\n\n##\nAllowances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Allowances\")]\n\nTo compensate for any dimensional and structural changes which will happen\nduring the casting or patterning process, allowances are usually made in the\npattern.[7]\n\n### Contraction allowance / Shrinkage\nallowance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Contraction allowance / Shrinkage allowance\")]\n\nshrinkage allowance : almost all metals shrink or contract volumaterically\nafter solidification to obtain a particular size of casting an amount is equal\nto the shrinkage or contraction......\n\nThe metal which undergo shrinkage during solidification and contract further\non cooling to room temperature. To compensate this, the pattern is made larger\nthan the required casting. This extra size is given on the pattern for metal\nshrinkage is called shrinkage allowance.\n\nThe pattern needs to incorporate suitable\n[allowances](/wiki/Allowance_\\(engineering\\) \"Allowance \\(engineering\\)\") for\nshrinkage; these are called _contraction allowances,_ and their exact values\ndepend on the alloy being cast and the exact sand casting method being used.\nSome alloys will have overall linear shrinkage of up to 2.5%, whereas other\nalloys may actually experience no shrinkage or a slight \"positive\" shrinkage\nor increase in size in the casting process (notably [type\nmetal](/wiki/Type_metal \"Type metal\") and certain cast irons). The shrinkage\namount is also dependent on the sand casting process employed, for example\nclay-bonded sand, chemical bonded sands, or other bonding materials used\nwithin the sand. This was traditionally accounted for using a [shrink\nrule](/wiki/Shrink_rule \"Shrink rule\"), which is an oversized\n[rule](/wiki/Ruler \"Ruler\").\n\nShrinkage can again be classified into _liquid shrinkage_ and _solid\nshrinkage_. Liquid shrinkage is the reduction in volume during the process of\nsolidification, and Solid shrinkage is the reduction in volume during the\ncooling of the cast metal. Shrinkage allowance takes into account only the\nsolid shrinkage. The liquid shrinkage is accounted for by risers.\n\n### Draft\nallowance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Draft allowance\")]\n\nWhen the pattern is to be removed from the sand mold, there is a possibility\nthat any leading edges may break off, or get damaged in the process. To avoid\nthis, a taper is provided on the pattern, so as to facilitate easy removal of\nthe pattern from the mold, and hence reduce damage to edges. The taper angle\nprovided is called the _Draft angle_. The value of the draft angle depends\nupon the complexity of the pattern, the type of molding (hand molding or\nmachine molding), height of the surface, etc. Draft provided on the casting is\nusually 1 to 3 degrees on external surfaces (5 to 8 internal surfaces).[8]\n\n### Finishing or Machining\nallowance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Finishing or Machining allowance\")]\n\nThe surface finish obtained in sand castings is generally poor (dimensionally\ninaccurate), and hence in many cases, the cast product is subjected to\n[machining](/wiki/Machining \"Machining\") processes like turning or\n[grinding](/wiki/Grinding_\\(abrasive_cutting\\) \"Grinding \\(abrasive\ncutting\\)\") in order to improve the surface finish. During machining\nprocesses, some metal is removed from the piece. To compensate for this, a\nmachining allowance (additional material) should be given in the casting.[8]\nthe amount of finish allowance depends on the material of the casting,size of\ncasting,volume of production, method of molding, and etc..\n\n### Shake\nallowance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Shake allowance\")]\n\nUsually during removal of the pattern from the mold cavity, the pattern is\nrapped all around the faces, in order to facilitate easy removal. In this\nprocess, the final cavity is enlarged. To compensate for this, the pattern\ndimensions need to be reduced. There are no standard values for this\nallowance, as it is heavily dependent on the personnel. This allowance is a\nnegative allowance, and a common way of going around this allowance is to\nincrease the draft allowance. Shaking of the pattern causes an enlargement of\nthe mould cavity and results in a bigger casting.[8]\n\n### Distortion\nallowance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Distortion allowance\")]\n\nDuring cooling of the mould, stresses developed in the solid metal may induce\ndistortions in the cast. This is more evident when the mould is thinner in\nwidth as compared to its length. This can be eliminated by initially\ndistorting the pattern in the opposite direction.[7]\n\n## Demand[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Demand\")]\n\nPatterns continue to be needed for sand casting of metals. For the production\nof gray iron, ductile iron and steel castings, sand casting remains the most\nwidely used process. For aluminum castings, sand casting represents about 12%\nof the total tonnage by weight (surpassed only by [die\ncasting](/wiki/Die_casting \"Die casting\") at 57%, and semi-permanent and\npermanent mold at 19%; based on 2006 shipments). The exact process and pattern\nequipment is always determined by the order quantities and the casting design.\nSand casting can produce as little as one part, or as many as a million\ncopies.\n\nAlthough [additive manufacturing](/wiki/3D_printing \"3D printing\") modalities\nsuch as [SLS](/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering \"Selective laser sintering\") or\n[SLM](/wiki/Selective_laser_melting \"Selective laser melting\") have potential\nto replace casting for some production situations, casting is still far from\nbeing completely displaced. Wherever it provides suitable material properties\nat competitive [unit cost](/wiki/Unit_cost \"Unit cost\"), it will remain in\ndemand.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pattern_\\(casting\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | Wikimedia Commons has media related to _**[Casting patterns](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Casting_patterns \"commons:Category:Casting patterns\")**_.  \n---|---  \n  \n  1. **Jump up ^** Bawa, H S (2004).
