Many other countries have large proportions of immigrants,\nsuch as [Switzerland with 24.9%](/wiki/Immigration_to_Switzerland \"Immigration\nto Switzerland\") and [Canada with 21.9%](/wiki/Immigration_to_Canada\n\"Immigration to Canada\").[2][3]\n\nAccording to the 2016 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, the United States\nadmitted 1.18 million legal immigrants in 2016.[4] Of these, 20% were family-\nsponsored, 47% were the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, 12% were\nemployment-based preferences, 4% were part of the [Diversity Immigrant\nVisa](/wiki/Diversity_Immigrant_Visa \"Diversity Immigrant Visa\") program, and\n13% were refugees and asylum-seekers.[4] The remainder included small numbers\nfrom several other categories, including interpreters and other Iraqis and\nAfghans employed by U.S. Government; persons admitted under the [Nicaraguan\nand Central American Relief\nAct](/wiki/Nicaraguan_and_Central_American_Relief_Act \"Nicaraguan and Central\nAmerican Relief Act\"); children born subsequent to the issuance of a parent's\nvisa; and certain parolees from the former Soviet Union, Cambodia, Laos, or\nVietnam who were denied refugee status.[4]\n\nThe economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused\ncontroversy regarding such issues as mainitaining [ethnic\nhomogeneity](/wiki/American_ethnicity \"American ethnicity\"), workers for\nemployers versus jobs for non-immigrants, settlement patterns, impact on\nupward [social mobility](/wiki/Socioeconomic_mobility_in_the_United_States\n\"Socioeconomic mobility in the United States\"),\n[crime](/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States \"Crime in the United States\"), and\nvoting behavior.\n\nPrior to 1965, policies such as the [national origins\nformula](/wiki/National_Origins_Formula \"National Origins Formula\") limited\n[immigration](/wiki/Immigration \"Immigration\") and\n[naturalization](/wiki/Naturalization \"Naturalization\") opportunities for\npeople from areas outside [Western Europe](/wiki/Western_Europe \"Western\nEurope\").

With few exceptions, the evidence suggests that on average,\nimmigration has positive economic effects on the native population, but it is\nmixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled\nnatives. Studies also show that immigrants have lower crime rates than natives\nin the United States.[9][10][11] Research shows that the United States excels\nat assimilating first- and second-generation immigrants relative to many other\nWestern countries.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Contemporary immigration\n    * 2.1 Ethnicity\n  * 3 Demography\n    * 3.1 Extent and destinations\n    * 3.2 Origin\n  * 4 Effects of immigration\n    * 4.1 Demographics\n    * 4.2 Economic\n      * 4.2.1 Overall economic prosperity\n      * 4.2.2 Fiscal effects\n      * 4.2.3 Inequality\n      * 4.2.4 Impact of undocumented immigrants\n      * 4.2.5 Impact of refugees\n      * 4.2.6 Innovation and entrepreneurship\n    * 4.3 Social\n      * 4.3.1 Discrimination\n        * 4.3.1.1 Business\n        * 4.3.1.2 Criminal justice system\n        * 4.3.1.3 Education\n        * 4.3.1.4 Housing\n        * 4.3.1.5 Labor market\n        * 4.3.1.6 Discrimination between minority groups\n      * 4.3.2 Assimilation\n      * 4.3.3 Religious diversity\n        * 4.3.3.1 Labor unions\n    * 4.4 Political\n    * 4.5 Health\n    * 4.6 Crime\n      * 4.6.1 Crimmigration\n    * 4.7 Education\n    * 4.8 Science and Engineering\n    * 4.9 Lobbying\n  * 5 Public opinion\n    * 5.1 Religious responses\n  * 6 Legal issues\n    * 6.1 Laws concerning immigration and naturalization\n    * 6.2 Asylum for refugees\n    * 6.3 Miscellaneous documented immigration\n    * 6.4 Illegal immigration\n    * 6.5 Military immigration\n  * 7 Immigration in popular culture\n    * 7.1 Immigration in literature\n  * 8 Documentary films\n  * 9 Legal perspectives\n  * 10 Interpretive perspectives\n  * 11 See also\n  * 12 Footnotes\n  * 13 Further reading\n    * 13.1 Surveys\n    * 13.2 Before 1920\n    * 13.3 Recent: post 1965\n  * 14 External links\n    * 14.1 History\n    * 14.2 Immigration policy\n    * 14.3 Current immigration\n    * 14.4 Economic impact\n\n## History\n\nMain article: [History of immigration to the United\nStates](/wiki/History_of_immigration_to_the_United_States \"History of\nimmigration to the United States\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Welcome_to_the_land_of_freedom.png/250px-\nWelcome_to_the_land_of_freedom.png)](/wiki/File:Welcome_to_the_land_of_freedom.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Welcome_to_the_land_of_freedom.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nImmigrants on ocean steamer passing the Statue of Liberty, New York City, 1887\n\nAmerican immigration history can be viewed in four epochs: the colonial\nperiod, the mid-19th century, the start of the 20th century, and post-1965.\nEach period brought distinct national groups, races and ethnicities to the\nUnited States. During the 17th century, approximately 400,000 English people\nmigrated to Colonial America.[12] However only half stayed permanently. From\n1700 to 1775 between 400-500,000 immigrated.

Over half of all European immigrants to\nColonial America during the 17th and 18th centuries arrived as [indentured\nservants](/wiki/Indentured_servant \"Indentured servant\").[13] They numbered\n350,000 (Encyclopedia, p. 202). The European populations of the Middle\nColonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware were ethnically\nvery mixed, the English constituting only 30 in Pennsylvania, 40% in New\nJersey to 45% in New York (numbered22 thousand or 18% in NY) (Duncan. op. cit.\np. 10). The mid-19th century saw an influx mainly from northern Europe from\nthe same major ethnic groups as for the Colonial Period but with large numbers\nof Catholic Irish and Scandinavians added to the mix; the late 19th and early\n20th-century immigrants were mainly from Southern and Eastern Europe, but\nthere were also several million immigrants from Canada; post-1965 most came\nfrom Latin America and Asia.\n\nHistorians estimate that fewer than 1 million immigrants moved to the United\nStates from Europe between 1600 and 1799.[14] By comparison, in the first\nfederal census, in 1790, the population of the United States was enumerated to\nbe 3,929,214.[15] The [1790 Act](/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1790\n\"Naturalization Act of 1790\") limited naturalization to \"free white persons\";\nit was expanded to include blacks in the 1860s and Asians in the 1950s.[16] In\nthe early years of the United States, immigration was fewer than 8,000 people\na year,[17] including French refugees from the slave revolt in Haiti. After\n1820, immigration gradually increased. From 1836 to 1914, over 30 million\nEuropeans migrated to the United States.[18] The death rate on these\ntransatlantic voyages was high, during which one in seven travelers died.[19]\nIn 1875, the nation passed its first immigration law, the [Page Act of\n1875](/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875 \"Page Act of 1875\").[20]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Ellis_island_1902.jpg/250px-\nEllis_island_1902.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ellis_island_1902.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ellis_island_1902.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nImmigrants arriving at [Ellis Island](/wiki/Ellis_Island \"Ellis Island\"), 1902\n\nAfter an initial wave of immigration from China following the [California Gold\nRush](/wiki/California_Gold_Rush \"California Gold Rush\"), Congress passed a\nseries of laws culminating in the [Chinese Exclusion\nAct](/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act \"Chinese Exclusion Act\") of 1882, banning\nvirtually all immigration from China until the law's repeal in 1943.

In the final\nprosperous year, 1929, there were 279,678 immigrants recorded,[24] but in\n1933, only 23,068 moved to the U.S.[14] In the early 1930s, more people\nemigrated from the United States than to it.[25] The U.S. government sponsored\na [Mexican Repatriation](/wiki/Mexican_Repatriation \"Mexican Repatriation\")\nprogram which was intended to encourage people to voluntarily move to Mexico,\nbut thousands were deported against their will.[26] Altogether about 400,000\nMexicans were repatriated half of them US citizens.[27] Most of the Jewish\nrefugees fleeing the Nazis and World War II were barred from coming to the\nUnited States.[28] In the post-war era, the Justice Department launched\n[Operation Wetback](/wiki/Operation_Wetback \"Operation Wetback\"), under which\n1,075,168 Mexicans were deported in 1954.[29]\n\n> First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually.\n> Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains\n> substantially the same. ...

This phenomenon has held true throughout the history of\nimmigration to the United States.[59] Seven out of ten immigrants surveyed by\n[Public Agenda](/wiki/Public_Agenda \"Public Agenda\") in 2009 said they\nintended to make the U.S. their permanent home, and 71% said if they could do\nit over again they would still come to the US.

In the most recent\ndecade, the ten million legal immigrants that settled in the U.S. represent an\nannual growth of only about 0.3% as the U.S. population grew from 249 million\nto 281 million. By comparison, the highest previous decade was the 1900s, when\n8.8 million people arrived, increasing the total U.S. population by one\npercent every year. Specifically, \"nearly 15% of Americans were foreign-born\nin 1910, while in 1999, only about 10% were foreign-born.\"[80]\n\nBy 1970, immigrants accounted for 4.7 percent of the US population and rising\nto 6.2 percent in 1980, with an estimated 12.5 percent in 2009.[81] As of\n2010[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immigration_to_the_United_States&action=edit),\n25% of US residents under age 18 were first- or second-generation\nimmigrants.[82] Eight percent of all babies born in the U.S. in 2008 belonged\nto illegal immigrant parents, according to a recent analysis of U.S. Census\nBureau data by the Pew Hispanic Center.[83]\n\nLegal immigration to the U.S. increased from 250,000 in the 1930s, to 2.5\nmillion in the 1950s, to 4.5 million in the 1970s, and to 7.3 million in the\n1980s, before resting at about 10 million in the 1990s.[84] Since 2000, legal\nimmigrants to the United States number approximately 1,000,000 per year, of\nwhom about 600,000 are _Change of Status_ who already are in the U.S. Legal\nimmigrants to the United States now are at their highest level ever, at just\nover 37,000,000 legal immigrants. Illegal immigration may be as high as\n1,500,000 per year with a net of at least 700,000 illegal immigrants arriving\nevery year.[85][86] Immigration led to a 57.4% increase in foreign born\npopulation from 1990 to 2000.[87]\n\nWhile immigration has increased drastically over the last century, the foreign\nborn share of the population is, at 13.4, only somewhat below what it was at\nits peak in 1910 at 14.7%. A number of factors may be attributed to the\ndecrease in the representation of foreign born residents in the United States.\nMost significant has been the change in the composition of immigrants; prior\nto 1890, 82% of immigrants came from North and Western Europe. From 1891 to\n1920, that number dropped to 25%, with a rise in immigrants from East,\nCentral, and South Europe, summing up to 64%. Animosity towards these\ndifferent and foreign immigrants rose in the United States, resulting in much\nlegislation to limit immigration.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nContemporary immigrants settle predominantly in seven states,\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\"), [New\nYork](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\) \"New York \\(state\\)\"), [Florida](/wiki/Florida\n\"Florida\"), [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\"), [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania\n\"Pennsylvania\"), [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey \"New Jersey\") and\n[Illinois](/wiki/Illinois \"Illinois\"), comprising about 44% of the U.S.\npopulation as a whole.

Bureau estimates the US population will grow from 317 million in\n2014 to 417 million in 2060 with immigration, when nearly 20% will be foreign\nborn.[96] A 2015 report from the [Pew Research\nCenter](/wiki/Pew_Research_Center \"Pew Research Center\") projects that by\n2065, non-Hispanic [whites](/wiki/White_American \"White American\") will\naccount for 46% of the population, down from the 2005 figure of 67%.[97] Non-\nHispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.[98] It also foresees\nthe [Hispanic](/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans \"Hispanic and Latino\nAmericans\") population rising from 17% in 2014 to 29% by 2060. The\n[Asian](/wiki/Asian_American \"Asian American\") population is expected to\nnearly double in 2060.[96] Overall, the Pew Report predicts the population of\nthe United States will rise from 296 million in 2005 to 441 million in 2065,\nbut only to 338 million with no immigration.[97]\n\nIn 35 of the country's [50 largest\ncities](/wiki/List_of_the_largest_metropolitan_areas_in_the_Americas \"List of\nthe largest metropolitan areas in the Americas\"), non-Hispanic whites were at\nthe last census or are predicted to be in the minority.[99] In California,\nnon-Hispanic whites slipped from 80% of the state's population in 1970 to 42%\nin 2001[100] and 39% in 2013.[101]\n\nImmigrant segregation declined in the first half of the 20th century, but has\nbeen rising over the past few decades. This has caused questioning of the\ncorrectness of describing the United States as a [melting\npot](/wiki/Melting_pot \"Melting pot\"). One explanation is that groups with\nlower socioeconomic status concentrate in more densely populated area that\nhave access to [public transit](/wiki/Public_transit \"Public transit\") while\ngroups with higher socioeconomic status move to [suburban](/wiki/Suburban\n\"Suburban\") areas. Another is that some recent immigrant groups are more\nculturally and linguistically different from earlier groups and prefer to live\ntogether due to factors such as communication costs.[102] Another explanation\nfor increased segregation is [white flight](/wiki/White_flight \"White\nflight\").[103]\n\nPlace of birth for the foreign-born population in the United States\n\nTop ten countries  | 2015  | 2010  | 2000  | 1990   \n---|---|---|---|---  \nMexico  | 11,643,298  | 11,711,103  | 9,177,487  | 4,298,014   \nChina  | 2,676,697  | 2,166,526  | 1,518,652  | 921,070   \nIndia  | 2,389,639  | 1,780,322  | 1,022,552  | 450,406   \nPhilippines  | 1,982,369  | 1,777,588  | 1,369,070  | 912,674   \nEl Salvador  | 1,352,357  | 1,214,049  | 817,336  | 465,433   \nVietnam  | 1,300,515  | 1,240,542  | 988,174  | 543,262   \nCuba  | 1,210,674  | 1,104,679  | 872,716  | 736,971   \nDominican Republic  | 1,063,239  | 879,187  | 687,677  | 347,858   \nSouth Korea  | 1,060,019  | 1,100,422  | 864,125  | 568,397   \nGuatemala  | 927,593  | 830,824  | 480,665  | 225,739   \nAll of Latin America  |  | 21,224,087  | 16,086,974  | 8,407,837   \nAll Immigrants  | 43,289,646  | 39,955,854  | 31,107,889  | 19,767,316   \n  \nSource: 1990, 2000 and 2010 decennial Census and 2015 American Community\nSurvey\n\n### Economic\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/San_Jose_May_Day_01.jpg/220px-\nSan_Jose_May_Day_01.jpg)](/wiki/File:San_Jose_May_Day_01.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:San_Jose_May_Day_01.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMexican immigrants march for more rights in Northern California's largest\ncity, [San Jose](/wiki/San_Jose,_California \"San Jose, California\") (2006).\n\nA survey of leading economists shows a consensus behind the view that high-\nskilled immigration makes the average American better off.[104] A survey of\nthe same economists also shows strong support behind the notion that low-\nskilled immigration makes the average American better off.[105] According to\n[David Card](/wiki/David_Card \"David Card\"), Christian Dustmann, and Ian\nPreston, \"most existing studies of the economic impacts of immigration suggest\nthese impacts are small, and on average benefit the native population\".[106]\nIn a survey of the existing literature, Örn B Bodvarsson and Hendrik Van den\nBerg write, \"a comparison of the evidence from all the studies ... makes it\nclear that, with very few exceptions, there is no strong statistical support\nfor the view held by many members of the public, namely that immigration has\nan adverse effect on native-born workers in the destination country.\"[107]\n\n#### Overall economic prosperity\n\nWhereas the impact on the average native tends to be small and positive,\nstudies show more mixed results for low-skilled natives, but whether the\neffects are positive or negative, they tend to be small either way.[108]\n\nImmigrants may often do types of work that natives are largely unwilling to\ndo, contributing to greater economic prosperity for the economy as a whole:\nfor instance, Mexican migrant workers taking up manual farm work in the United\nStates has close to zero effect on native employment in that occupation, which\nmeans that the effect of Mexican workers on U.S. employment outside farm work\nwas therefore most likely positive, since they raised overall economic\nproductivity.[109] Research indicates that immigrants are more likely to work\nin risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average\ncharacteristics, such as immigrants' lower English language ability and\neducational attainment.[110] Further, some studies indicate that higher ethnic\nconcentration in metropolitan areas is positively related to the probability\nof self-employment of immigrants.[111]\n\nResearch also suggests that diversity has a net positive effect on\nproductivity[112][113] and economic prosperity.[114][114][115][116][117] A\nstudy by [Nathan Nunn](/wiki/Nathan_Nunn \"Nathan Nunn\"), Nancy Qian and Sandra\nSequeira found that the Age of Mass Migration (1850–1920) has had\nsubstantially beneficial long-term effects on U.S. economic prosperity:\n\"locations with more historical immigration today have higher incomes, less\npoverty, less unemployment, higher rates of urbanization, and greater\neducational attainment. The long-run effects appear to arise from the\npersistence of sizeable short-run benefits, including earlier and more\nintensive industrialization, increased agricultural productivity, and more\ninnovation.\"[118] The authors also find that the immigration had short-term\nbenefits: \"that there is no evidence that these long-run benefits come at\nshort-run costs. In fact, immigration immediately led to economic benefits\nthat took the form of higher incomes, higher productivity, more innovation,\nand more industrialization.\"[119]\n\nResearch also finds that migration leads to greater trade in goods and\nservices.[120][121][122][123] Using 130 years of data on historical migrations\nto the United States, one study finds \"that a doubling of the number of\nresidents with ancestry from a given foreign country relative to the mean\nincreases by 4.2 percentage points the probability that at least one local\nfirm invests in that country, and increases by 31% the number of employees at\ndomestic recipients of FDI from that country. The size of these effects\nincreases with the ethnic diversity of the local population, the geographic\ndistance to the origin country, and the ethno-linguistic fractionalization of\nthe origin country.\"[124]\n\nSome research suggests that immigration can offset some of the adverse effects\nof automation on native labor outcomes in the United States.[125][126] By\nincreasing overall demand, immigrants could push natives out of low-skilled\nmanual labor into better paying occupations.[125][126] A 2018 study in the\n_American Economic Review_ found that the [Bracero\nprogram](/wiki/Bracero_program \"Bracero program\") (which allowed almost half a\nmillion Mexican workers to do seasonal farm labor in the United States) did\nnot have any adverse impact on the labor market outcomes of American-born farm\nworkers.[127]\n\n#### Fiscal effects\n\nA 2011 literature review of the economic impacts of immigration found that the\nnet fiscal impact of migrants varies across studies but that the most credible\nanalyses typically find small and positive fiscal effects on average.[128]\nAccording to the authors, \"the net social impact of an immigrant over his or\nher lifetime depends substantially and in predictable ways on the immigrant's\nage at arrival, education, reason for migration, and similar\".[128]\n\nA 2016 report by the [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and\nMedicine](/wiki/National_Academies_of_Sciences,_Engineering,_and_Medicine\n\"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine\") concluded that\nover a 75-year time horizon, “the fiscal impacts of immigrants are generally\npositive at the federal level and generally negative at the state and local\nlevel.”[129] The reason for the costs to state and local governments is that\nthe cost of educating the immigrants' children falls on state and local\ngovernments.[130] According to a 2007 literature review by the [Congressional\nBudget Office](/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office \"Congressional Budget\nOffice\"), \"Over the past two decades, most efforts to estimate the fiscal\nimpact of immigration in the United States have concluded that, in aggregate\nand over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants—both\nlegal and unauthorized—exceed the cost of the services they use.\"[131]\n\nAccording to James Smith, a senior economist at Santa Monica-based [RAND\nCorporation](/wiki/RAND_Corporation \"RAND Corporation\") and lead author of the\n[United States National Research\nCouncil](/wiki/United_States_National_Research_Council \"United States National\nResearch Council\")'s study _\"[The New Americans: Economic, Demographic, and\nFiscal Effects of\nImmigration](/wiki/The_New_Americans:_Economic,_Demographic,_and_Fiscal_Effects_of_Immigration\n\"The New Americans: Economic, Demographic, and Fiscal Effects of\nImmigration\")\"_, immigrants contribute as much as $10 billion to the [U.S.\neconomy](/wiki/U.S._economy \"U.S. economy\") each year.[132] The NRC report\nfound that although immigrants, especially those from Latin America, caused a\nnet loss in terms of taxes paid versus social services received, immigration\ncan provide an overall gain to the domestic economy due to an increase in pay\nfor higher-skilled workers, lower prices for goods and services produced by\nimmigrant labor, and more efficiency and lower wages for some owners of\ncapital. The report also notes that although immigrant workers compete with\n[domestic workers](/wiki/Domestic_worker \"Domestic worker\") for low-skilled\njobs, some immigrants specialize in activities that otherwise would not exist\nin an area, and thus can be beneficial for all domestic residents.[133]\n\nImmigration and foreign labor documentation fees increased over 80% in 2007,\nwith over 90% of funding for USCIS derived from immigration application fees,\ncreating many USCIS jobs involving immigration to US, such as immigration\ninterview officials, finger print processor, Department of Homeland Security,\netc.[134]\n\n#### Inequality\n\nOverall immigration has not had much effect on native wage\ninequality[135][136] but low-skill immigration has been linked to greater\nincome inequality in the native population.[137]\n\n#### Impact of undocumented immigrants\n\nMain article: [Economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United\nStates](/wiki/Economic_impact_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_United_States\n\"Economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United States\")\n\nResearch on the economic effects of undocumented immigrants is scant but\nexisting peer-reviewed studies suggest that the effects are positive for the\nnative population[138][139] and public coffers.[131] A 2015 study shows that\n\"increasing deportation rates and tightening border control weakens low-\nskilled labor markets, increasing unemployment of native low-skilled workers.\nLegalization, instead, decreases the unemployment rate of low-skilled natives\nand increases income per native.\"[140] Studies show that legalization of\nundocumented immigrants would boost the U.S. economy; a 2013 study found that\ngranting legal status to undocumented immigrants would raise their incomes by\na quarter (increasing U.S. GDP by approximately $1.4 trillion over a ten-year\nperiod),[141] and 2016 study found that \"legalization would increase the\neconomic contribution of the unauthorized population by about 20%, to 3.6% of\nprivate-sector GDP.\"[142]\n\nA 2007 literature by the [Congressional Budget\nOffice](/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office \"Congressional Budget Office\") found\nthat estimating the fiscal effects of undocumented immigrants has proven\ndifficult: \"currently available estimates have significant limitations;\ntherefore, using them to determine an aggregate effect across all states would\nbe difficult and prone to considerable error\". The impact of undocumented\nimmigrants differs on federal levels than state and local levels,[131] with\nresearch suggesting modest fiscal costs at the state and local levels but with\nsubstantial fiscal gains at the federal level.[143]\n\nIn 2009, a study by the [Cato Institute](/wiki/Cato_Institute \"Cato\nInstitute\"), a [free market](/wiki/Free_market \"Free market\") [think\ntank](/wiki/Think_tank \"Think tank\"), found that legalization of low-skilled\nillegal resident workers in the US would result in a net increase in US GDP of\n$180 billion over ten years.[144] The Cato Institute study did not examine the\nimpact on per capita income for most Americans. Jason Riley notes that because\nof progressive income taxation, in which the top 1% of earners pay 37% of\nfederal income taxes (even though they actually pay a lower tax percentage\nbased on their income), 60% of Americans collect more in government services\nthan they pay in, which also reflects on immigrants.[145] In any event, the\ntypical immigrant and his children will pay a net $80,000 more in their\nlifetime than they collect in government services according to the NAS.[146]\nLegal immigration policy is set to maximize net taxation. Illegal immigrants\neven after an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in\ntaxes. In 2010, an [econometrics](/wiki/Econometrics \"Econometrics\") study by\na [Rutgers](/wiki/Rutgers_University \"Rutgers University\")\n[economist](/wiki/Economist \"Economist\") found that immigration helped\nincrease bilateral trade when the incoming people were connected via networks\nto their country of origin, particularly boosting trade of [final\ngoods](/wiki/Final_goods \"Final goods\") as opposed to [intermediate\ngoods](/wiki/Intermediate_goods \"Intermediate goods\"), but that the trade\nbenefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American\nculture.[147]\n\nAccording to NPR in 2005, about 3% of illegal immigrants were working in\n[agriculture](/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_United_States \"Agriculture in the\nUnited States\").[148] The [H-2A visa](/wiki/H-2A_visa \"H-2A visa\") allows U.S.\nemployers to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill\n[temporary](/wiki/Guest_worker_program \"Guest worker program\") agricultural\njobs.[149] The passing of tough immigration laws in several states from around\n2009 provides a number of practical case studies. The state of Georgia passed\nimmigration law [HB 87](/wiki/HB_87 \"HB 87\") in 2011;[150] this led, according\nto the coalition of top Kansas businesses, to 50% of its agricultural produce\nbeing left to rot in the fields, at a cost to the state of more than $400\nmillion. Overall losses caused by the act were $1 billion; it was estimated\nthat the figure would become over $20 billion if all the estimated 325,000\nunauthorized workers left Georgia. The cost to Alabama of its crackdown in\nJune 2011 has been estimated at almost $11 billion, with up to 80,000\nunauthorized immigrant workers leaving the state.[151]\n\n#### Impact of refugees\n\nStudies of refugees' impact on native welfare are scant but the existing\nliterature shows a positive fiscal impact and mixed results (negative,\npositive and no significant effects) on native welfare.[152][153][154][155] A\n2017 paper by Evans and Fitzgerald found that refugees to the United States\npay \"$21,000 more in taxes than they receive in benefits over their first 20\nyears in the U.S.\"[154] An internal study by the Department of Health and\nHuman Services under the Trump administration, which was suppressed and not\nshown to the public, found that refugees to the United States brought in $63\nbillion more in government revenues than they cost the government.[155]\nAccording to labor economist Giovanni Peri, the existing literature suggests\nthat there are no economic reasons why the American labor market could not\neasily absorb 100,000 Syrian refugees in a year.[156] Refugees integrate more\nslowly into host countries' labor markets than labor migrants, in part due to\nthe loss and depreciation of human capital and credentials during the asylum\nprocedure.[157]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Chinatown_manhattan_2009.JPG/220px-\nChinatown_manhattan_2009.JPG)](/wiki/File:Chinatown_manhattan_2009.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chinatown_manhattan_2009.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nGarment factories in [Manhattan's Chinatown](/wiki/Chinatown,_Manhattan\n\"Chinatown, Manhattan\")\n\n#### Innovation and entrepreneurship\n\nAccording to one survey of the existing economic literature, \"much of the\nexisting research points towards positive net contributions by immigrant\nentrepreneurs.\"[158] Areas where immigrant are more prevalent in the United\nStates have substantially more innovation (as measured by patenting and\ncitations).[159] Immigrants to the United States create businesses at higher\nrates than natives.[160] According to a 2018 paper, \"first-generation\nimmigrants create about 25% of new firms in the United States, but this share\nexceeds 40% in some states.\"[161] Another 2018 paper links H-1B visa holders\nto innovation.[162]\n\nImmigrants have been linked to greater invention and innovation in the\nUS.[163] According to one report, \"immigrants have started more than half (44\nof 87) of America's startup companies valued at $1 billion or more and are key\nmembers of management or product development teams in over 70 percent (62 of\n87) of these companies.\"[164] Foreign doctoral students are a major source of\ninnovation in the American economy.[165] In the United States, immigrant\nworkers hold a disproportionate share of jobs in science, technology,\nengineering, and math (STEM): \"In 2013, foreign-born workers accounted for\n19.2 percent of STEM workers with a bachelor's degree, 40.7 percent of those\nwith a master's degree, and more than half—54.5 percent—of those with a\nPh.D.\"[166]\n\nThe Kauffman Foundation's index of entrepreneurial activity is nearly 40%\nhigher for immigrants than for natives.[167] Immigrants were involved in the\nfounding of many prominent American high-tech companies, such as Google,\nYahoo, YouTube, Sun Microsystems, and eBay.[168]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Andrew_Carnegie_by_Francis_Luis_Mora.jpg/170px-\nAndrew_Carnegie_by_Francis_Luis_Mora.jpg)](/wiki/File:Andrew_Carnegie_by_Francis_Luis_Mora.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Andrew_Carnegie_by_Francis_Luis_Mora.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nScottish immigrant [Andrew Carnegie](/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie \"Andrew Carnegie\")\nled the enormous expansion of the American [steel\nindustry](/wiki/Steel_industry \"Steel industry\") in the late 19th century.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Sears_Tower_ss.jpg/180px-\nSears_Tower_ss.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sears_Tower_ss.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sears_Tower_ss.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Bangladeshi](/wiki/Bangladeshi_American \"Bangladeshi American\") immigrant\n[Fazlur Rahman Khan](/wiki/Fazlur_Rahman_Khan \"Fazlur Rahman Khan\") was\nresponsible for the engineering design of [Sears Tower](/wiki/Sears_Tower\n\"Sears Tower\") (now Willis Tower),[169][170] the tallest building in the world\nuntil 1998.[171]\n\n### Social\n\n#### Discrimination\n\nIrish immigration was opposed in the 1850s by the\n[nativist](/wiki/Nativism_\\(politics\\) \"Nativism \\(politics\\)\") [Know\nNothing](/wiki/Know_Nothing \"Know Nothing\") movement, originating in New York\nin 1843. It was engendered by popular fears that the country was being\noverwhelmed by [Irish Catholic](/wiki/Irish_Catholic \"Irish Catholic\")\nimmigrants. On [March 14, 1891](/wiki/March_14,_1891_lynchings \"March 14, 1891\nlynchings\"), a lynch mob stormed a local jail and lynched several\n[Italians](/wiki/Italians \"Italians\") following the acquittal of several\nSicilian immigrants alleged to be involved in the murder of [New\nOrleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\") police chief [David\nHennessy](/wiki/David_Hennessy \"David Hennessy\"). The Congress passed the\nEmergency Quota Act in 1921, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924. The\nImmigration Act of 1924 was aimed at limiting immigration overall, and making\nsure that the nationalities of new arrivals matched the overall national\nprofile.\n\n##### Business\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis of racial discrimination in product markets found\nextensive evidence of minority applicants being quoted higher prices for\nproducts.[172] A 1995 study found that car dealers \"quoted significantly lower\nprices to white males than to black or female test buyers using identical,\nscripted bargaining strategies.\"[173] A 2013 study found that eBay sellers of\niPods received 21 percent more offers if a white hand held the iPod in the\nphoto than a black hand.[174]\n\n##### Criminal justice system\n\nResearch suggests that police practices, such as [racial\nprofiling](/wiki/Racial_profiling \"Racial profiling\"), over-policing in areas\npopulated by minorities and in-group bias may result in disproportionately\nhigh numbers of racial minorities among crime suspects.[175][176][177][178]\nResearch also suggests that there may be possible discrimination by the\njudicial system, which contributes to a higher number of convictions for\nracial minorities.[179][180][181][182][183] A 2012 study found that \"(i)\njuries formed from all-white jury pools convict black defendants significantly\n(16 percentage points) more often than white defendants, and (ii) this gap in\nconviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at least\none black member.\"[181] Research has found evidence of in-group bias, where\n\"black (white) juveniles who are randomly assigned to black (white) judges are\nmore likely to get incarcerated (as opposed to being placed on probation), and\nthey receive longer sentences.\"[183] In-group bias has also been observed when\nit comes to traffic citations, as black and white cops are more likely to cite\nout-groups.[177]\n\n##### Education\n\nA 2015 study using correspondence tests \"found that when considering requests\nfrom prospective students seeking mentoring in the future, faculty were\nsignificantly more responsive to White males than to all other categories of\nstudents, collectively, particularly in higher-paying disciplines and private\ninstitutions.\"[184] Through affirmative action, there is reason to believe\nthat elite colleges favor minority applicants.[185]\n\n##### Housing\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis found extensive evidence of [racial discrimination in the\nAmerican housing market](/wiki/Housing_discrimination_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Housing discrimination \\(United States\\)\").[172] Minority applicants for\nhousing needed to make many more enquiries to view properties.[172]\nGeographical steering of African-Americans in US housing remained\nsignificant.[172] A 2003 study finds \"evidence that agents interpret an\ninitial housing request as an indication of a customer's preferences, but also\nare more likely to withhold a house from all customers when it is in an\nintegrated suburban neighborhood ([redlining](/wiki/Redlining \"Redlining\")).\nMoreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but\nnot for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in\nsuburban, integrated areas ([steering](/wiki/Racial_steering \"Racial\nsteering\")); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the\ninitial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white.\nThese three findings are consistent with the possibility that agents act upon\nthe belief that some types of transactions are relatively unlikely for black\ncustomers (statistical discrimination).\"[186]\n\nA report by the federal [Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development\n\"United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\") where the\ndepartment sent African-Americans and whites to look at apartments found that\nAfrican-Americans were shown fewer apartments to rent and houses for\nsale.[187]\n\n##### Labor market\n\nSeveral meta-analyses find extensive evidence of ethnic and racial\ndiscrimination in hiring in the American labor market.[172][188][189] A 2016\nmeta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests—tests where identical CVs for\nstereotypically black and white names were sent to employers—in 43 separate\nstudies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015 finds that there is\nextensive racial discrimination in hiring decisions in Europe and North-\nAmerica.[189] These correspondence tests showed that equivalent minority\ncandidates need to send around 50% more applications to be invited for an\ninterview than majority candidates.[189][190] A study that examine the job\napplications of actual people provided with identical résumés and similar\ninterview training showed that African-American applicants with no criminal\nrecord were offered jobs at a rate as low as white applicants who had criminal\nrecords.[191]\n\n##### Discrimination between minority groups\n\nRacist thinking among and between minority groups does occur;[192][193]\nexamples of this are conflicts between blacks and\n[Korean](/wiki/Korean_American \"Korean American\") immigrants,[194] notably in\nthe [1992 Los Angeles Riots](/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_Riots \"1992 Los Angeles\nRiots\"), and between [African Americans](/wiki/African_Americans \"African\nAmericans\") and non-white [Latino](/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans\n\"Hispanic and Latino Americans\") immigrants.[195][196] There has been a long\nrunning racial tension between African American and Mexican [prison\ngangs](/wiki/Prison_gangs \"Prison gangs\"), as well as significant riots in\nCalifornia prisons where they have targeted each other, for ethnic\nreasons.[197][198] There have been reports of racially motivated attacks\nagainst African Americans who have moved into neighborhoods occupied mostly by\npeople of Mexican origin, and vice versa.[199][200] There has also been an\nincrease in violence between [non-Hispanic whites](/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites\n\"Non-Hispanic whites\") and Latino immigrants, and between\n[African](/wiki/Africans_in_the_United_States \"Africans in the United States\")\nimmigrants and African Americans.[201]\n\n#### Assimilation\n\nA 2018 study in the _American Sociological Review_ found that within racial\ngroups, most immigrants to the United States had fully assimilated within a\nspan of 20 years.[202] Immigrants arriving in the United States after 1994\nassimilate more rapidly than immigrants who arrived in previous periods.[202]\nMeasuring assimilation can be difficult due to \"ethnic attrition\", which\nrefers to when ancestors of migrants cease to self-identify with the\nnationality or ethnicity of their ancestors. This means that successful cases\nof assimilation will be underestimated. Research shows that ethnic attrition\nis sizable in Hispanic and Asian immigrant groups in the United\nStates.[203][204] By taking account of ethnic attrition, the assimilation rate\nof Hispanics in the United States improves significantly.[203][205] A 2016\npaper challenges the view that cultural differences are necessarily an\nobstacle to long-run economic performance of migrants. It finds that \"first\ngeneration migrants seem to be less likely to success the more culturally\ndistant they are, but this effect vanishes as time spent in the USA\nincreases.\"[206]\n\n#### Religious diversity\n\nImmigration from South Asia and elsewhere has contributed to enlarging the\nreligious composition of the United States. [Islam in the United\nStates](/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States \"Islam in the United States\") is\ngrowing mainly due to immigration. [Hinduism in the United\nStates](/wiki/Hinduism_in_the_United_States \"Hinduism in the United States\"),\n[Buddhism in the United States](/wiki/Buddhism_in_the_United_States \"Buddhism\nin the United States\"), and [Sikhism in the United\nStates](/wiki/Sikhism_in_the_United_States \"Sikhism in the United States\") are\nother examples.[207] Whereas non-Christians together constitute only 4% of the\nU.S. population, they made up 20% of the 2003 cohort of new immigrants.[208]\n\nSince 1992, an estimated 1.7 million Muslims, approximately 1 million Hindus,\nand approximately 1 million Buddhists have immigrated legally to the United\nStates.[209]\n\nConversely, non-religious are underrepresented in the immigrant populations.\nAlthough “other” non-Christian religions are also slightly more common among\nimmigrants than among U.S. adults—1.9% compared with 1.0%—those professing no\nreligion are slightly under-represented among new immigrants. Whereas 12% of\nimmigrants said they had no religion, the figure was 15% for adult\nAmericans.[208] This lack of representation for non-religious could be related\nto stigmas around atheists and agnostics or could relate to the need for\nidentity when entering a new country.\n\n##### Labor unions\n\nMain article: [Immigration policies of American labor\nunions](/wiki/Immigration_policies_of_American_labor_unions \"Immigration\npolicies of American labor unions\")\n\nThe [American Federation of Labor](/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor\n\"American Federation of Labor\") (AFL), a coalition of labor unions formed in\nthe 1880s, vigorously opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe for moral,\ncultural, and racial reasons. The issue unified the workers who feared that an\ninflux of new workers would flood the labor market and lower wages.[210]\nNativism was not a factor because upwards of half the union members were\nthemselves immigrants or the sons of immigrants from Ireland, Germany and\nBritain. However, nativism was a factor when the AFL even more strenuously\nopposed all immigration from Asia because it represented (to its Euro-American\nmembers) an alien culture that could not be assimilated into American society.\nThe AFL intensified its opposition after 1906 and was instrumental in passing\nimmigration restriction bills from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921\n[Emergency Quota Act](/wiki/Emergency_Quota_Act \"Emergency Quota Act\") and the\n[Immigration Act of 1924](/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924 \"Immigration Act of\n1924\"), and seeing that they were strictly enforced.[211][212]\n\nMink (1986) concludes that the link between the AFL and the [Democratic\nParty](/wiki/History_of_the_Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"History of the\nDemocratic Party \\(United States\\)\") rested in part on immigration issues,\nnoting the large corporations, which supported the Republicans, wanted more\nimmigration to augment their labor force.[211]\n\n[United Farm Workers](/wiki/United_Farm_Workers \"United Farm Workers\") during\n[Cesar Chavez](/wiki/Cesar_Chavez \"Cesar Chavez\") tenure was committed to\nrestricting immigration. Chavez and [Dolores Huerta](/wiki/Dolores_Huerta\n\"Dolores Huerta\"), cofounder and president of the UFW, fought the [Bracero\nProgram](/wiki/Bracero_Program \"Bracero Program\") that existed from 1942 to\n1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined\nU.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program\nensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants\ncould not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and\nreplaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in\n1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed\nemployer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring illegal immigrants.\n\nOn a few occasions, concerns that illegal immigrant labor would undermine UFW\nstrike campaigns led to a number of controversial events, which the UFW\ndescribes as anti-strikebreaking events, but which have also been interpreted\nas being anti-immigrant. In 1973, Chavez and members of the UFW marched\nthrough the [Imperial](/wiki/Imperial_Valley_\\(California\\) \"Imperial Valley\n\\(California\\)\") and [Coachella Valleys](/wiki/Coachella_Valley \"Coachella\nValley\") to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of illegal immigrants\nas strikebreakers. Joining him on the march were Reverend [Ralph\nAbernathy](/wiki/Ralph_Abernathy \"Ralph Abernathy\") and U.S. Senator [Walter\nMondale](/wiki/Walter_Mondale \"Walter Mondale\").[213] In its early years, the\nUFW and Chavez went so far as to report illegal immigrants who served as\nstrikebreaking replacement workers (as well as those who refused to unionize)\nto the [Immigration and Naturalization\nService](/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service \"Immigration and\nNaturalization Service\").[214][215][216][217][218]\n\nIn 1973, the United Farm Workers set up a \"wet line\" along the [United States-\nMexico border](/wiki/United_States-Mexico_border \"United States-Mexico\nborder\") to prevent Mexican immigrants from entering the United States\nillegally and potentially undermining the UFW's unionization efforts.[219]\nDuring one such event, in which Chavez was not involved, some [UFW](/wiki/UFW\n\"UFW\") members, under the guidance of Chavez's cousin Manuel, physically\nattacked the strikebreakers after peaceful attempts to persuade them not to\ncross the border failed.[220][221][222]\n\n### Political\n\nSee also: [Immigration reform](/wiki/Immigration_reform \"Immigration reform\")\nand [Nativism (politics)](/wiki/Nativism_\\(politics\\) \"Nativism \\(politics\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/May_Day_Immigration_March_LA20.jpg/210px-\nMay_Day_Immigration_March_LA20.jpg)](/wiki/File:May_Day_Immigration_March_LA20.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:May_Day_Immigration_March_LA20.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nImmigrant rights march in downtown [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los\nAngeles\"), California on May Day, 2006.\n\nA _[Boston Globe](/wiki/The_Boston_Globe \"The Boston Globe\")_ article\nattributed [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\")'s win in the\n[2008 U.S. Presidential\nelection](/wiki/United_States_Presidential_election,_2008 \"United States\nPresidential election, 2008\") to a marked reduction over the preceding decades\nin the percentage of whites in the American electorate, attributing this\ndemographic change to the Immigration Act of 1965.[31] The article quoted\n[Simon Rosenberg](/wiki/Simon_Rosenberg \"Simon Rosenberg\"), president and\nfounder of the [New Democrat Network](/wiki/New_Democrat_Network \"New Democrat\nNetwork\"), as having said that the Act is \"the most important piece of\nlegislation that no one's ever heard of,\" and that it \"set America on a very\ndifferent demographic course than the previous 300 years.\"[31]\n\nImmigrants differ on their political views; however, the [Democratic\nParty](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party \\(United\nStates\\)\") is considered to be in a far stronger position among immigrants\noverall.[223][224] Research shows that religious affiliation can also\nsignificantly impact both their social values and voting patterns of\nimmigrants, as well as the broader American population. Hispanic evangelicals,\nfor example, are more strongly conservative than non-Hispanic\nevangelicals.[225] This trend is often similar for Hispanics or others\nstrongly identifying with the [Catholic Church](/wiki/Catholic_Church\n\"Catholic Church\"), a religion that strongly opposes abortion and gay\nmarriage.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/May_1_2006_Rally_in_Chicago.jpg/210px-\nMay_1_2006_Rally_in_Chicago.jpg)](/wiki/File:May_1_2006_Rally_in_Chicago.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:May_1_2006_Rally_in_Chicago.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA rally in [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\"), part of the Great American\nBoycott and [2006 U.S. immigration reform\nprotests](/wiki/2006_United_States_immigration_reform_protests \"2006 United\nStates immigration reform protests\"), on May 1, 2006.\n\nThe key interests groups that lobby on immigration are religious, ethnic and\nbusiness groups, together with some liberals and some conservative public\npolicy organizations. Both the pro- and anti- groups affect policy.[226]\n\nStudies have suggested that some [special interest\ngroup](/wiki/Special_interest_group \"Special interest group\") lobby for less\nimmigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since\nthey see effects of immigration, such as increased labor competition, as\ndetrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when affecting other\ngroups.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nA 2011 paper found that both pro- and anti-immigration special interest groups\nplay a role in migration policy. \"Barriers to migration are lower in sectors\nin which business lobbies incur larger lobbying expenditures and higher in\nsectors where labor unions are more important.\"[226] A 2011 study examining\nthe voting of US representatives on migration policy suggests that\n\"representatives from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to\nsupport an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite\nis true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant\ndistricts.\"[227]\n\nAfter the 2010 election, Gary Segura of Latino Decisions stated that Hispanic\nvoters influenced the outcome and \"may have saved the Senate for\nDemocrats\".[228] Several ethnic lobbies support immigration reforms that would\nallow [illegal immigrants](/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States\n\"Illegal immigration to the United States\") that have succeeded in entering to\ngain citizenship. They may also lobby for special arrangements for their own\ngroup. The Chairman for the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform has stated that\n\"the Irish Lobby will push for any special arrangement it can get—'as will\nevery other ethnic group in the country.'\"[229][230] The\n[irredentist](/wiki/Irredentism \"Irredentism\") and ethnic\n[separatist](/wiki/Separatist \"Separatist\") movements for\n[Reconquista](/wiki/Reconquista_\\(Mexico\\) \"Reconquista \\(Mexico\\)\") and\n[Aztlán](/wiki/Aztl%C3%A1n \"Aztlán\") see immigration from Mexico as\nstrengthening their cause.[231][232]\n\nThe book _Ethnic Lobbies and US Foreign Policy_ (2009) states that several\nethnic special interest groups are involved in pro-immigration lobbying.\nEthnic lobbies also influence [foreign policy](/wiki/Foreign_policy \"Foreign\npolicy\"). The authors write that \"Increasingly, ethnic tensions surface in\nelectoral races, with House, Senate, and gubernatorial contests serving as\nproxy battlegrounds for antagonistic ethnoracial groups and communities. In\naddition, ethnic politics affect party politics as well, as groups compete for\nrelative political power within a party\". However, the authors argue that\ncurrently ethnic interest groups, in general, do not have too much power in\nforeign policy and can balance other special interest groups.[233]\n\nIn a 2012 news story, _Reuters_ reported, \"Strong support from Hispanics, the\nfastest-growing demographic in the United States, helped tip President Barack\nObama's fortunes as he secured a [second term in the White\nHouse](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012 \"United States\npresidential election, 2012\"), according to Election Day polling.\"[234]\n\nLately, there is talk among several Republican leaders, such as governors\n[Bobby Jindal](/wiki/Bobby_Jindal \"Bobby Jindal\") and [Susana\nMartinez](/wiki/Susana_Martinez \"Susana Martinez\"), of taking a new,\nfriendlier approach to immigration. Former US Secretary of Commerce [Carlos\nGutierrez](/wiki/Carlos_Gutierrez \"Carlos Gutierrez\") is promoting the\ncreation of [Republicans for Immigration\nReform](/wiki/Republicans_for_Immigration_Reform \"Republicans for Immigration\nReform\").[235][236]\n\n[Bernie Sanders](/wiki/Bernie_Sanders \"Bernie Sanders\") opposes guest worker\nprograms[237] and is also skeptical about skilled immigrant ([H-1B](/wiki/H-1B\n\"H-1B\")) visas, saying, \"Last year, the top 10 employers of H-1B guest workers\nwere all offshore outsourcing companies. These firms are responsible for\nshipping large numbers of American information technology jobs to India and\nother countries.\"[128][238] In an interview with _Vox_ he stated his\nopposition to an open borders immigration policy, describing it as:\n\n> ... a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States\n> ... you're doing away with the concept of a nation-state.

I think we have to raise wages in this country, I\n> think we have to do everything we can to create millions of jobs.[239][240]\n\nApril 2018, Trump calls for National Guard at the border to secure the ongoing\nattempts at a border wall along the United States-Mexico border. According to\nthe LAtimes, \"Defense Secretary James N. Mattis has signed an order to send up\nto 4,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border but barred them from\ninteracting with migrants detained by the Border Patrol in most\ncircumstances\".[241]\n\nThe caravan of migrants from Central America have reached the United States to\nseek asylum. The last of the caravan have arrived and are processing as of May\n4, 2018.[242] Remarks by Attorney General Sessions have expressed hesitation\nwith asylum seekers. Sessions has stated, \"The system is being gamed, there's\nno doubt about it\".[243] This statement implied asylum seekers were attempting\nto immigrate to the United States for work or various other reasons rather\nthan seeking refuge.\n\n### Health\n\nThe issue of the health of immigrants and the associated cost to the public\nhas been largely discussed. On average, per capita health care spending is\nlower for immigrants than it is for native-born Americans.[244] The non-\nemergency use of emergency rooms ostensibly indicates an incapacity to pay,\nyet some studies allege disproportionately lower access to unpaid health care\nby immigrants.[245] For this and other reasons, there have been various\ndisputes about how much immigration is costing the United States public health\nsystem.[246] [University of\nMaryland](/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park \"University of Maryland,\nCollege Park\") economist and Cato Institute scholar [Julian Lincoln\nSimon](/wiki/Julian_Lincoln_Simon \"Julian Lincoln Simon\") concluded in 1995\nthat while immigrants probably pay more into the health system than they take\nout, this is not the case for elderly immigrants and refugees, who are more\ndependent on public services for survival.[247] Immigration itself may impact\nwomen’s health. A 2017 study found that Latino women suffer higher rates of\nintimate partner violence (IPV) than native US women. Migration may worsen IPV\nrates and outcomes. Migration itself may not cause IPV, but it may make it\nmore difficult for women to get help. According to Kim et al., the IPV is\nusually the result of unequal family structures rather than the process of\nmigration.[248]\n\nImmigration from areas of high incidences of disease is thought to have fueled\nthe resurgence of [tuberculosis](/wiki/Tuberculosis \"Tuberculosis\") (TB),\n[chagas](/wiki/Chagas_disease \"Chagas disease\"), and\n[hepatitis](/wiki/Hepatitis \"Hepatitis\") in areas of low incidence.[249]\nAccording to [Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention](/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention \"Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention\") (CDC), TB cases among foreign-born\nindividuals remain disproportionately high, at nearly nine times the rate of\nU.S.-born persons.[250][251] To reduce the risk of\n[diseases](/wiki/Infectious_diseases#Mortality_from_infectious_diseases\n\"Infectious diseases\") in low-incidence areas, the main countermeasure has\nbeen the screening of immigrants on arrival.[252] [HIV](/wiki/HIV\n\"HIV\")/[AIDS](/wiki/AIDS \"AIDS\") entered the United States in around 1969,\nlikely through a single infected immigrant from Haiti.[253][254] Conversely,\nmany new HIV infections in Mexico can be traced back to the United\nStates.[255] People infected with HIV were banned from entering the United\nStates in 1987 by executive order, but the 1993 statute supporting the ban was\nlifted in 2009. The executive branch is expected to administratively remove\nHIV from the list of infectious diseases barring immigration, but immigrants\ngenerally would need to show that they would not be a burden on public\nwelfare.[256] Researchers have also found what is known as the \"healthy\nimmigrant effect\", in which immigrants in general tend to be healthier than\nindividuals born in the U.S.[257][258] Immigrants are more likely than native-\nborn Americans to have a medical visit labeled [uncompensated\ncare](/wiki/Uncompensated_care \"Uncompensated care\").[259]\n\n### Crime\n\nThere is no empirical evidence that either legal or illegal immigration\nincreases crime in the United States.[10][260] In fact, a majority of studies\nin the U.S. have found lower crime rates among immigrants than among non-\nimmigrants, and that higher concentrations of immigrants are associated with\nlower crime rates.[9][11][260] Explanations proposed to account for this\nrelationship have included ethnic enclaves, self-selection, and the hypothesis\nthat immigrants revitalize communities to which they emigrate.[261]\n\nSome research even suggests that increases in immigration may partly explain\nthe reduction in the U.S. crime rate.[262][263][264][265][266] A 2005 study\nshowed that immigration to large U.S. metropolitan areas does not increase,\nand in some cases decreases, crime rates there.[267] A 2009 study found that\nrecent immigration was not associated with homicide in [Austin,\nTexas](/wiki/Austin,_Texas \"Austin, Texas\").[268] The low crime rates of\nimmigrants to the United States despite having lower levels of education,\nlower levels of income and residing in urban areas (factors that should lead\nto higher crime rates) may be due to lower rates of antisocial behavior among\nimmigrants.[269] A 2015 study found that Mexican immigration to the United\nStates was associated with an increase in aggravated assaults and a decrease\nin property crimes.[270] A 2016 study finds no link between immigrant\npopulations and violent crime, although there is a small but significant\nassociation between undocumented immigrants and drug-related crime.[271]\n\nA 2018 study found that undocumented immigration to the United States did not\nincrease violent crime.[272] Research finds that [Secure\nCommunities](/wiki/Secure_Communities_and_administrative_immigration_policies\n\"Secure Communities and administrative immigration policies\"), an immigration\nenforcement program which led to a quarter of a million of detentions (when\nthe study was published; November 2014), had no observable impact on the crime\nrate.[273] A 2015 study found that the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control\nAct, which legalized almost 3 million immigrants, led to \"decreases in crime\nof 3–5 percent, primarily due to decline in property crimes, equivalent to\n120,000-180,000 fewer violent and property crimes committed each year due to\nlegalization\".[274] According to one study, [sanctuary\ncities](/wiki/Sanctuary_city \"Sanctuary city\")—which adopt policies designed\nto not prosecute people solely for being an illegal immigrant—have no\nstatistically meaningful effect on crime.[275]\n\nOne of the first political analyses in the U.S. of the relationship between\nimmigration and crime was performed in the beginning of the 20th century by\nthe [Dillingham Commission](/wiki/Dillingham_Commission \"Dillingham\nCommission\"), which found a relationship especially for immigrants from non-\nNorthern European countries, resulting in the sweeping 1920s [immigration\nreduction](/wiki/Immigration_reduction \"Immigration reduction\") acts,\nincluding the [Emergency Quota Act](/wiki/Emergency_Quota_Act \"Emergency Quota\nAct\") of 1921, which favored immigration from [northern](/wiki/Northern_Europe\n\"Northern Europe\") and [western Europe](/wiki/Western_Europe \"Western\nEurope\").[276] Recent research is skeptical of the conclusion drawn by the\nDillingham Commission. One study finds that \"major government commissions on\nimmigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that\nsuffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data,\nwhich led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the\nimmigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we\nfind that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite\nsimilar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the\ncommitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930,\nimmigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all\nages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments\nfor violent offenses.\"[277]\n\nFor the early twentieth century, one study found that immigrants had \"quite\nsimilar\" imprisonment rates for major crimes as natives in 1904 but lower for\nmajor crimes (except violent offenses; the rate was similar) in 1930.[277]\nContemporary commissions used dubious data and interpreted it in questionable\nways.[277]\n\nResearch suggests that police practices, such as [racial\nprofiling](/wiki/Racial_profiling \"Racial profiling\"), over-policing in areas\npopulated by minorities and in-group bias may result in disproportionately\nhigh numbers of immigrants among crime suspects.[175][176][278][178] Research\nalso suggests that there may be possible discrimination by the judicial\nsystem, which contributes to a higher number of convictions for\nimmigrants.[179][180][181][182][183]\n\n#### Crimmigration\n\nCrimmigration has emerged as a field in which critical immigration scholars\nconceptualize the current immigration law enforcement system. Crimmigration is\nbroadly defined as the convergence of the criminal justice system and\nimmigration enforcement,[279] where immigration law enforcement has adopted\nthe “criminal” law enforcement approach. This frames undocumented immigrants\nas “criminal” deviants and security risks.[280] Crime and migration control\nhave become completely intertwined, so much so that both undocumented and\ndocumented individuals suspected of being a noncitizen may be targeted.[280]\n\nUsing a \"crimmigration\" point of thought, César Cuauhtémoc García\nHernández[280] explains the criminalization of undocumented immigrants began\nin the aftermath of the [civil rights movement](/wiki/Civil_rights_movement\n\"Civil rights movement\").[280] [Michelle Alexander](/wiki/Michelle_Alexander\n\"Michelle Alexander\") explores how the U.S. criminal justice system is made of\n“colorblind” policies and law enforcement practices that have shaped the mass\nincarceration of people of color into an era of “The New Jim Crow\"[281] As\nAlexander and García Hernández state, overt racism and racist laws became\nculturally scorned, and covert racism became the norm.[280][281] This new form\nof racism focuses on penalizing criminal activity and promoting “neutral”\nrhetoric.[281][280]\n\n\"Crimmigration\" recognizes how laws and policies throughout different states\ncontribute to the convergence of criminal law enforcement and immigration law.\nFor example, states are implementing a variety of immigration related criminal\noffenses that are punishable by imprisonment. California, Oregon, and Wyoming\ncriminalize the use of fraudulent immigration or citizenship documents.[282]\nArizona allows judges to confine witnesses in certain “criminal” cases if they\nare suspected of being in the U.S. without documentation.[282] The most common\nviolations of immigration law on the federal level are unauthorized entry (a\nfederal misdemeanor) and unauthorized reentry (a federal felony). These\n“offenses” deemed as “crimes” under immigration law set the tone of\n\"crimmigration\" and for what García Hernández refers to as the “removal\npipeline” of immigrants.[282]\n\nSome scholars focus on the organization of \"crimmigration\" as it relates to\nthe mass removal of certain immigrants. Jennifer Chacón finds that immigration\nlaw enforcement is being decentralized.[283] [Customs and Border\nPatrol](/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection \"U.S. Customs and Border\nProtection\") (CBP), [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement](/wiki/Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement \"Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement\") (ICE), and the [Department of Homeland\nSecurity](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security \"United States\nDepartment of Homeland Security\") (DHS) are the central law enforcement\nagencies in control of enforcing immigration law. However, other federal,\nstate and local law enforcement agencies, such as sheriff’s offices, municipal\npolice departments, the [Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation](/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation \"Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation\") (FBI), and the Drug and Enforcement Agency (DEA), aid in\nimmigrant removal.[283] In 1996, Congress expanded power to state and local\nlaw enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law. These agencies\nkeep people locked up in jails or prison when they receive an \"immigration\ndetainer\" from ICE,[282] and therefore aid in interior enforcement.[283] In\naddition, some agencies participate in the State Criminal Alien Assistance\nProgram (“SCAAP”), which gives these agencies financial incentives to\ncooperate with ICE in identifying immigrants in their custody.[282] These are\ndirect example of how \"crimmigration\" works within the U.S. immigration\nsystem. With immigration enforcement reaching all levels of enforcement\nagencies, the Immigration Industrial Complex (which is similar to the [Prison\nIndustrial Complex](/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex \"Prison–industrial\ncomplex\")) and concept of \"crimmigration\" thrives.\n\n### Education\n\nScientific laboratories and startup internet opportunities have been a\npowerful American magnet. By 2000, 23% of scientists with a PhD in the U.S.\nwere immigrants, including 40% of those in engineering and computers.[284]\nRoughly a third of the United State's college and universities graduate\nstudents in [STEM fields](/wiki/STEM_fields \"STEM fields\") are foreign\nnationals—in some states it is well over half of their graduate students. On\n[Ash Wednesday](/wiki/Ash_Wednesday \"Ash Wednesday\"), March 5, 2014, the\npresidents of 28 Catholic and Jesuit colleges and universities, joined the\n\"Fast for Families\" movement.[285] The \"Fast for Families\" movement reignited\nthe immigration debate in the fall of 2013 when the movement's leaders,\nsupported by many members of Congress and the President, fasted for twenty-two\ndays on the [National Mall](/wiki/National_Mall \"National Mall\") in\nWashington, D.C.[286]\n\nA study on public schools in California found that white enrollment declined\nin response to increases in the number of Spanish-speaking Limited English\nProficient and Hispanic students. This [white flight](/wiki/White_flight\n\"White flight\") was greater for schools with relatively larger proportions of\nSpanish-speaking Limited English Proficient.[103]\n\nA North Carolina study found that the presence of Latin American children in\nschools had no significant negative effects on peers, but that students with\nlimited English skills had slight negative effects on peers.[287]\n\n### Science and Engineering\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/FR_khan_sculputure_at_Sears_tower.jpg/220px-\nFR_khan_sculputure_at_Sears_tower.jpg)](/wiki/File:FR_khan_sculputure_at_Sears_tower.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:FR_khan_sculputure_at_Sears_tower.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nImmigrant [Fazlur Khan](/wiki/Fazlur_Khan \"Fazlur Khan\") is known for making\nsome very important advancements in skyscraper engineering.[288] Sculpture\nhonoring Khan at the Willis Tower.\n\nIn the [United States of America](/wiki/United_States_of_America \"United\nStates of America\"), a significant proportion of scientists and engineers are\nforeign-born, as well as students in science and engineering programs.\nHowever, this is not unique to the US since foreigners make up significant\namounts of scientists and engineers in other countries. As of 2011, 28% of\ngraduate students in science, engineering, and health are foreign.[289] The\nnumber of science and engineering (S&E) bachelor's degrees has risen steadily\nover the past 15 years, reaching a new peak of about half a million in 2009.\nSince 2000, foreign born students in the United States have consistently\nearned a small share (3%-4%) of S&E degrees at the bachelor's level. Foreign\nstudents make up a much higher proportion of S&E master's degree recipients\nthan of bachelor's or associate degree recipients. In 2009, foreign students\nearned 27% of S&E master's degrees and 33% in doctorate degrees. Significant\nnumbers of foreign born students in science and engineering are not unique to\nAmerica since foreign students now account for nearly 60% of graduate students\nin mathematics, computer sciences, and engineering globally. In Switzerland\nand the United Kingdom, more than 40% of doctoral students are foreign. A\nnumber of other countries, including New Zealand, Austria, Australia, Belgium,\nCanada, and the United States, have relatively high percentages (more than\n20%) of doctoral students who are foreign. Foreign student enrollment in the\nUnited Kingdom has been increasing. In 2008, foreign students made up 47% of\nall graduate students studying S&E in the United Kingdom (an increase from 32%\nin 1998). Top destinations for international students include the United\nKingdom (12%), Germany (9%), and France (9%). Together with the U.S.,these\ncountries receive more than half of all internationally mobile students\nworldwide. Although the United States continues to attract the largest number\nand fraction of foreign students worldwide, its share of foreign students has\ndecreased in recent years.[290]\n\n55% of Ph.D. students in engineering in the United States are foreign born\n(2004).[291] Between 1980 and 2000, the percentage of Ph.D. scientists and\nengineers employed in the United States who were born abroad has increased\nfrom 24% to 37%.[291] 45% of Ph.D. physicists working in the United States are\nforeign born in 2004.[291] 80% of total post-doctoral\n[chemical](/wiki/Chemical_Engineering \"Chemical Engineering\") and [materials\nengineering](/wiki/Materials_engineering \"Materials engineering\") in the\nUnited States are foreign-born (1988).[292]\n\nAt the undergraduate level, US-born engineering students constitute upwards of\n90-95% of the student population (most foreign born candidates for engineering\ngraduate schools are trained in their home countries). However, the pool of BS\nengineering graduates with US citizenship is much larger than the number who\napply to engineering graduate schools.[292] The proportion of foreign-born\nengineers among assistant professors younger than 35 years has increased from\n10% in 1972 to 50%-55% in 1983-1985, illustrating a dramatic increase on US\ndependence on foreign-born students in the US college system. The increase in\nnon-citizen assistant professors of engineering is the result of the fact\nthat, in recent years, foreign-born engineers received close to 50 percent of\nnewly awarded engineering doctorates (naturalized citizens accounted for about\n4 percent) and, furthermore, they entered academe in disproportionately large\nnumbers.[292] 33% of all U.S. Ph.D.s in science and engineering are now\nawarded to foreign born graduate students as of 2004.[291]\n\nIn 1982, foreign-born engineers constituted about 3.6% of all engineers\nemployed in the United States, 13.9% of which were naturalized; and foreign-\nborn Phds in Engineering constituted 15% and 20% were naturalized.[292] In\n1985, foreign-born Phds represented almost 33% of the engineering post-\ndoctorate researchers in US universities. Foreign-born Phd engineers often\naccept postdoctoral position because other employment is unavailable until\ngreen card is obtained.[292] A system that further incentivising replacement\nof US-citizens in the upper echelons of academic and private sector\nengineering firms due to higher educational attainment relative to native-born\nengineer who for the most part do train beyond undergraduate level.[293]\n\nIn recent years, The number of applicants for faculty openings at research\nuniversities have increased dramatically. Numbers of 50 to 200 applications\nfor a single faculty opening have become typical, yet even with such high\nnumbers of applicants have yielded a foreign-born component in excess of\n50%.[292] 60% of the top science students and 65 percent of the top math\nstudents in the United States are the children of immigrants. In addition,\nforeign-born high school students make up 50 percent of the 2004 U.S.Math\nOlympiad’s top scorers, 38 percent of the U.S. Physics Team, and 25 percent of\nthe Intel Science Talent Search finalists—the United States’ most prestigious\nawards for young scientists and mathematicians.[294]\n\nAmong 1985 foreign-born engineering doctorate holders, about 40% expected to\nwork in the United States after graduating. An additional 17 percent planned\nto stay on as post-doctorates, and most of these are likely to remain\npermanently in the United States. Those, almost 60% of foreign-born\nengineering doctorate holders are likely to become part of the US engineering\nlabor force within a few years after graduating. The other approximately 40%\nof foreign born engineering Phds mostly likely find employment working for\n[Multinational corporations](/wiki/Multinational_corporations \"Multinational\ncorporations\") outside of the US.[292]\n\nIn the 2004 Intel Science Talent Search, more children (18) have parents who\nentered the country on H-1B (professional) visas than parents born in the\nUnited States (16). To place this finding in perspective, note that new [H-1B\nvisa](/wiki/H-1B_visa \"H-1B visa\") holders each year represent less than 0.04\npercent of the U.S. population.[294] Foreign born faculty now accounts for\nover 50% of faculty in engineering (1994).[292]\n\n27 out the 87 (more than 30%) American Nobel Prize winners in Medicine and\nPhysiology between 1901 and 2005 were born outside the US[295]\n\n1993 Median Salaries of U.S. Recipients of Ph.D.s in Science and Engineering:\nForeign-Born vs. Native-Born:[296]\n\nYears Since Earning Degree  | Foreign-Born  | Native-Born   \n---|---|---  \n1–5 years  | $44,400  | $40,000   \n6–10 years  | $55,400  | $49,200   \n11–15 years  | $64,000  | $56,000   \n16–20 years  | $64,000  | $56,000   \n21 years  | $70,200  | $68,000   \n  \n### Lobbying\n\nMajor American corporations spent $345 million [lobbying](/wiki/Lobbying\n\"Lobbying\") for just three pro-immigration bills between 2006 and 2008.[297]\n\nThe two most prominent [groups lobbying](/wiki/Lobby_groups \"Lobby groups\")\nfor more restrictive immigration policies for the United States are\n[NumbersUSA](/wiki/NumbersUSA \"NumbersUSA\") and the [Federation for American\nImmigration Reform](/wiki/Federation_for_American_Immigration_Reform\n\"Federation for American Immigration Reform\") (FAIR); additionally, the\n[Center for Immigration Studies](/wiki/Center_for_Immigration_Studies \"Center\nfor Immigration Studies\") [think tank](/wiki/Think_tank \"Think tank\") produces\npolicy analysis supportive of a more restrictive stance.\n\n## Public opinion\n\nThe ambivalent feeling of Americans toward immigrants is shown by a positive\nattitude toward groups that have been visible for a century or more, and much\nmore negative attitude toward recent arrivals. For example, a 1982 national\npoll by the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut showed respondents a\ncard listing a number of groups and asked, \"Thinking both of what they have\ncontributed to this country and have gotten from this country, for each one\ntell me whether you think, on balance, they've been a good or a bad thing for\nthis country,\" which produced the results shown in the table. \"By high\nmargins, Americans are telling pollsters it was a very good thing that Poles,\nItalians, and Jews immigrated to America. Once again, it's the newcomers who\nare viewed with suspicion. This time, it's the Mexicans, the Filipinos, and\nthe people from the Caribbean who make Americans nervous.\"[298][299]\n\nIn a 2002 study, which took place soon after the September 11 attacks, 55% of\nAmericans favored decreasing legal immigration, 27% favored keeping it at the\nsame level, and 15% favored increasing it.[300]\n\nIn 2006, the immigration-reduction advocacy think tank the Center for\nImmigration Studies released a poll that found that 68% of Americans think\nU.S. immigration levels are too high, and just 2% said they are too low. They\nalso found that 70% said they are less likely to vote for candidates that\nfavor increasing legal immigration.[301] In 2004, 55% of Americans believed\nlegal immigration should remain at the current level or increased and 41% said\nit should be decreased.[302] The less contact a native-born American has with\nimmigrants, the more likely one would have a negative view of immigrants.[302]\n\nOne of the most important factors regarding public opinion about immigration\nis the level of [unemployment](/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_unemployment_rate\n\"List of U.S. states by unemployment rate\"); anti-immigrant sentiment is where\nunemployment is highest, and vice versa.[303]\n\nSurveys indicate that the U.S. public consistently makes a sharp distinction\nbetween legal and illegal immigrants, and generally views those perceived as\n\"playing by the rules\" with more sympathy than immigrants that have entered\nthe country illegally.[304]\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll in July 2015, immigration is the fourth most\nimportant problem facing the United States and seven percent of Americans said\nit was the most important problem facing America today.[305] In March 2015,\nanother Gallup poll provided insight into American public opinion on\nimmigration; the poll revealed that 39% of people worried about immigration \"a\ngreat deal.\"[306] A January poll showed that only 33% of Americans were\nsatisfied with the current state of immigration in America.[307] As an issue\nthat is very important to Americans, polling reveals change in sentiment over\ntime and diverse opinions regarding how to handle immigration.\n\nBefore 2012, majority of Americans supported securing United States borders\ncompared to dealing with illegal immigrants in the United States. In 2013,\nthat trend has reversed and 55% of people polled by Gallup revealed that they\nwould choose “developing a plan to deal with immigrants who are currently in\nthe U.S. illegally.” Changes regarding border control are consistent across\nparty lines, with Republicans saying that “securing U.S. borders to halt flow\nof illegal immigrants” is extremely important decreasing from 68% in 2011 to\n56% in 2014. Meanwhile, Democrats who chose extremely important shifted from\n42% in 2011 to 31% in 2014.[308] In July 2013, 87% of Americans said they\nwould vote in support of a law that would “allow immigrants already in the\ncountry to become U.S. citizens if they meet certain requirements including\npaying taxes, having a criminal background check and learning English.”\nHowever, in the same survey, 83% also said they would support the tightening\nof U.S. border security.[309]\n\nDonald Trump's campaign for Presidency focused on a rhetoric of reducing\nillegal immigration and toughening border security. In July 2015, 48% of\nAmericans thought that Donald Trump would do a poor job of handling\nimmigration problems. In November 2016, 55% of Trump's voters thought that he\nwould do the right thing in regards to illegal immigration. In general, Trump\nsupporters are not united upon how to handle immigration. In December 2016,\nTrump voters were polled and 60% said that \"undocumented immigrants in the\nU.S. who meet certain requirements should be allowed to stay legally.\"[310]\n\nAmerican opinion regarding how immigrants affect the country and how the\ngovernment should respond to illegal immigration have changed over time. In\n2006, out of all U.S. adults surveyed, 28% declared that they believed the\ngrowing number of immigrants helped American workers and 55% believed that it\nhurt American workers. In 2016, those views had changed, with 42% believing\nthat they helped and 45% believing that they hurt.[311] The PRRI 2015 American\nValues Atlas showed that between 46% and 53% of Americans believed that \"the\ngrowing number of newcomers from other countries ... strengthens American\nsociety.\" In the same year, 57% and 66% of Americans chose that the U.S.\nshould \"allow [immigrants living in the U.S. illegally] a way to become\ncitizens provided they meet certain requirements.\"[312]\n\nIn February 2017, the American Enterprise Institute released a report on\nrecent surveys about immigration issues. In July 2016, 63% of Americans\nfavored the temporary bans of immigrants from areas with high levels of\nterrorism and 53% said the U.S. should allow fewer refugees to enter the\ncountry. In November 2016, 55% of Americans were opposed to building a border\nwall with Mexico. Since 1994, Pew Research center has tracked a change from\n63% of Americans saying that immigrants are a burden on the country to\n27%.[313]\n\n### Religious responses\n\nReligious figures in the United States have put forth their views on the topic\nof immigration as informed by their religious traditions.\n\n  * **Catholicism** – In 2018, Catholic leaders stated that asylum-limiting laws proposed by the Trump administration were immoral. Some bishops considered imposing sanctions (known as \"canonical penalties\") on church members who have participated in enforcing such policies.[314]\n\n  * **Judaism** – American Jewish rabbis from various denominations have stated that their understanding of Judaism is that immigrants and refugees should be welcomed, and even assisted. The exception would be if there is significant economic hardship or security issues faced by the host country or community, in which case immigration may be limited, discouraged or even prohibited altogether.[315] Some liberal denominations place greater emphasis on the welcoming of immigrants while Conservative, Orthodox and Independent rabbis also weigh economic and security concerns.[316] Some provide moral arguments for both the right of country to enforce immigration standards as well as for providing some sort of amnesty for illegal migrants.[317]\n\n## Legal issues\n\n### Laws concerning immigration and naturalization\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/US_Permanent_Resident_Card_2010-05-11.JPG/220px-\nUS_Permanent_Resident_Card_2010-05-11.JPG)](/wiki/File:US_Permanent_Resident_Card_2010-05-11.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:US_Permanent_Resident_Card_2010-05-11.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA U.S. [green card](/wiki/Permanent_residence_\\(United_States\\) \"Permanent\nresidence \\(United States\\)\"), a document confirming permanent resident status\nfor eligible immigrants, including refugees, political asylum seekers, family-\nsponsored migrants, employment-based workers and diversity immigrants (DV).\n\nSee also: [Illegal immigration to the United\nStates](/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States \"Illegal immigration to\nthe United States\") and [Guest Worker Program](/wiki/Guest_Worker_Program\n\"Guest Worker Program\")\n\nLaws concerning immigration and naturalization include:\n\n  * the [Immigration Act of 1990](/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1990 \"Immigration Act of 1990\") (IMMACT), which limits the annual number of immigrants to 700,000.

Under the program, eligible recipients\nwho applied and were granted DACA status were granted a two-year deferral from\ndeportation and temporary eligibility to work legally in the country.[333]\nAmong other criteria, in order to be eligible a youth applicant must (1) be\nbetween age 15 and 31; (2) have come to the United States before the age of\n16; (3) have lived in the U.S. continuously for at least five years; (4) be a\ncurrent student, or have earned a high school diploma or\n[equivalent](/wiki/General_Educational_Development \"General Educational\nDevelopment\"), or have received an [honorable\ndischarge](/wiki/Honorable_discharge \"Honorable discharge\") from the U.S.\narmed services; and (5) must not \"have not been convicted of a felony,\nsignificant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not otherwise\npose a threat to public safety or national security.\"[334] The Migration\nPolicy Institution estimated that as of 2016, about 1.3 million unauthorized\nyoung adults ages 15 and older were \"immediately eligible for DACA\"; of this\neligible population, 63% had applied as of March 2016.[333]\n\nChildren of legal migrants won’t qualify as Dreamers under DACA protection\nbecause they entered the country legally.[335] This is highlighted as the\nbiggest contradiction in US immigration policy by many advocates of legal\nimmigrants.\n\nIn 2014, President Obama announced a [set of executive\nactions](/wiki/Immigration_reform#Obama.27s_executive_actions_of_November_2014\n\"Immigration reform\"), the [Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and\nLawful Permanent\nResidents](/wiki/Deferred_Action_for_Parents_of_Americans_and_Lawful_Permanent_Residents\n\"Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents\").\nUnder this program, \"unauthorized immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens\nor lawful permanent residents (LPRs) would qualify for deferred action for\nthree years if they meet certain other requirements.\"[336] A February 2016\nMigration Policy Institute/[Urban Institute](/wiki/Urban_Institute \"Urban\nInstitute\") report found that (about 3.6 million people were potentially\neligible for DAPA and \"more than 10 million people live in households with at\nleast one potentially DAPA-eligible adult, including some 4.3 million children\nunder age 18 - an estimated 85 percent of whom are U.S. citizens.\"[336] The\nreport also found that \"the potentially DAPA eligible are well settled with\nstrong U.S. roots, with 69 percent having lived in the United States ten years\nor more, and 25 percent at least 20 years.\"[336]\n\nAlthough not without precedent under prior presidents,[337] President Obama's\nauthority to create DAPA and expand DACA were challenged in the federal courts\nby Texas and 25 other states.[336] In November 2015, the [U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth\nCircuit](/wiki/U.S._Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fifth_Circuit \"U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit\"), in a 2-1 decision in _[United States v.\nTexas](/wiki/United_States_v._Texas \"United States v. Texas\")_ , upheld a\npreliminary injunction blocking the programs from going forward.[338][339] The\ncase was heard by the [U.S. Supreme Court](/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court \"U.S.\nSupreme Court\"), which in June 2016 deadlocked 4-4, thus affirming the ruling\nof the Fifth Circuit but setting no nationally binding precedent.[340][341]\n\n### Military immigration\n\nOn November 15, 2013, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\nannounced that they would be issuing a new policy memorandum called \"parole in\nplace.[342]\" Parole in place would offer green cards to immigrant parents,\nspouses and children of active military duty personnel. Prior to this law\nrelatives of military personnel – excluding husbands and wives – were forced\nto leave the United States and apply for green cards in their home countries.\nThe law allows for family members to avoid the possible ten-year bar from the\nUnited States and remain in the United States while applying for lawful\npermanent residence.[343] The parole status, given in one year terms, will be\nsubject to the family member being \"absent a criminal conviction or other\nserious adverse factors.\"[343]\n\nMilitary children born in foreign countries are considered American from birth\nassuming both parents were American citizens at the time of birth. Children\nborn to American citizens will have to process Conciliary Reports of Birth\nAbroad. This report of birth abroad is the equivalent of a birth certificate\nand the child will use the report in place of a Birth Certificate for\ndocumentation. However, children born in foreign countries to United States\nservicemembers before they have gained citizenship will still be forced to\napply for their own citizenship or participate in programs similar to those\nmentioned above.\n\n## Immigration in popular culture\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Immigrants1888.jpg/350px-\nImmigrants1888.jpg)](/wiki/File:Immigrants1888.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Immigrants1888.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA cartoon in [_Puck_](/wiki/Puck_\\(magazine\\) \"Puck \\(magazine\\)\") from 1888\nattacked businessmen for welcoming large numbers of low paid immigrants,\nleaving the American men unemployed.[344]\n\nThe history of immigration to the United States is the history of the country\nitself, and the journey from beyond the sea is an element found in [American\nfolklore](/wiki/American_folklore \"American folklore\"), appearing over and\nover again in everything from _[The Godfather](/wiki/The_Godfather \"The\nGodfather\")_ to _[Gangs of New York](/wiki/Gangs_of_New_York \"Gangs of New\nYork\")_ to \"[The Song of Myself](/wiki/Song_of_Myself \"Song of Myself\")\" to\n[Neil Diamond](/wiki/Neil_Diamond \"Neil Diamond\")'s \"America\" to the animated\nfeature _[An American Tail](/wiki/An_American_Tail \"An American Tail\")_.[345]\n\nFrom the 1880s to the 1910s, vaudeville dominated the popular image of\nimmigrants, with very popular caricature portrayals of ethnic groups. The\nspecific features of these caricatures became widely accepted as accurate\nportrayals.[346]\n\nIn _The Melting Pot_ (1908), playwright [Israel\nZangwill](/wiki/Israel_Zangwill \"Israel Zangwill\") (1864–1926) explored issues\nthat dominated [Progressive Era](/wiki/Progressive_Era \"Progressive Era\")\ndebates about immigration policies. Zangwill's theme of the positive benefits\nof the American [melting pot](/wiki/Melting_pot \"Melting pot\") resonated\nwidely in popular culture and literary and academic circles in the 20th\ncentury; his cultural symbolism – in which he situated immigration issues –\nlikewise informed American cultural imagining of immigrants for decades, as\nexemplified by Hollywood films.[347][348] The popular culture's image of\nethnic celebrities often includes stereotypes about immigrant groups. For\nexample, Frank Sinatra's public image as a superstar contained important\nelements of the _[American Dream](/wiki/American_Dream \"American Dream\")_\nwhile simultaneously incorporating stereotypes about Italian Americans that\nwere based in nativist and Progressive responses to immigration.[349]\n\nThe process of assimilation has been a common theme of popular culture. For\nexample, \"lace-curtain Irish\" refers to middle-class [Irish\nAmericans](/wiki/Irish_Americans \"Irish Americans\") desiring assimilation into\nmainstream society in counterpoint to the older, more raffish \"shanty Irish\".\nThe occasional malapropisms and left-footed social blunders of these upward\nmobiles were gleefully lampooned in vaudeville, popular song, and the comic\nstrips of the day such as _[Bringing Up Father](/wiki/Bringing_Up_Father\n\"Bringing Up Father\")_ , starring Maggie and Jiggs, which ran in daily\nnewspapers for 87 years (1913 to 2000).[350][351] In _[The\nDeparted](/wiki/The_Departed \"The Departed\")_ (2006), Staff Sergeant Dignam\nregularly points out the dichotomy between the lace curtain Irish lifestyle\nBilly Costigan enjoyed with his mother, and the shanty Irish lifestyle of\nCostigan's father. In recent years the popular culture has paid special\nattention to Mexican immigration[352] and the film\n_[Spanglish](/wiki/Spanglish_\\(film\\) \"Spanglish \\(film\\)\")_ (2004) tells of a\nfriendship of a Mexican housemaid ([Paz Vega](/wiki/Paz_Vega \"Paz Vega\")) and\nher boss played by [Adam Sandler](/wiki/Adam_Sandler \"Adam Sandler\").\n\n### Immigration in literature\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/Jiggsslum1740.jpg/350px-\nJiggsslum1740.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jiggsslum1740.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jiggsslum1740.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMaggie and Jiggs from _[Bringing Up Father](/wiki/Bringing_Up_Father \"Bringing\nUp Father\")_ (January 7, 1940).\n\nNovelists and writers have captured much of the color and challenge in their\nimmigrant lives through their writings.[353]\n\nRegarding Irish women in the 19th century, there were numerous novels and\nshort stories by Harvey O'Higgins, Peter McCorry, Bernard O'Reilly and [Sarah\nOrne Jewett](/wiki/Sarah_Orne_Jewett \"Sarah Orne Jewett\") that emphasize\nemancipation from Old World controls, new opportunities and expansiveness of\nthe immigrant experience.[354]\n\nOn the other hand, Hladnik studies three popular novels of the late 19th\ncentury that warned Slovenes not to immigrate to the dangerous new world of\nthe United States.[355]\n\nJewish American writer [Anzia Yezierska](/wiki/Anzia_Yezierska \"Anzia\nYezierska\") wrote her novel _Bread Givers_ (1925) to explore such themes as\nRussian-Jewish immigration in the early 20th century, the tension between Old\nand New World Yiddish culture, and women's experience of immigration. A well\nestablished author Yezierska focused on the Jewish struggle to escape the\nghetto and enter middle- and upper-class America. In the novel, the heroine,\nSara Smolinsky, escape from New York City's \"down-town ghetto\" by breaking\ntradition. She quits her job at the family store and soon becomes engaged to a\nrich real-estate magnate. She graduates college and takes a high-prestige job\nteaching public school. Finally Sara restores her broken links to family and\nreligion.[356]\n\nThe Swedish author [Vilhelm Moberg](/wiki/Vilhelm_Moberg \"Vilhelm Moberg\") in\nthe mid-20th century wrote a series of four novels describing one Swedish\nfamily's migration from Småland to Minnesota in the late 19th century, a\ndestiny shared by almost one million people. The author emphasizes the\nauthenticity of the experiences as depicted (although he did change\nnames).[357] These novels have been translated into English (_[The\nEmigrants](/wiki/The_Emigrants_\\(Swedish_novel\\) \"The Emigrants \\(Swedish\nnovel\\)\")_ , 1951, _[Unto a Good Land](/wiki/Unto_a_Good_Land \"Unto a Good\nLand\")_ , 1954, _[The Settlers](/wiki/The_Settlers_\\(novel\\) \"The Settlers\n\\(novel\\)\")_ , 1961, _[The Last Letter Home](/wiki/The_Last_Letter_Home \"The\nLast Letter Home\")_ , 1961).

Since the debut of the first five films, the series has become an\nimportant resource for advocates, policy-makers and educators.[361]\n\nThat film series premiered nearly a decade after the filmmakers' landmark\ndocumentary film _[Well-Founded Fear](/wiki/Well-Founded_Fear \"Well-Founded\nFear\")_ which provided a behind-the-scenes look at the [process for seeking\nasylum in the United States](/wiki/Asylum_in_the_United_States \"Asylum in the\nUnited States\"). That film still marks the only time that a film-crew was\nprivy to the private proceedings at the [U.S. Immigration and Naturalization\nService](/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service \"Immigration and\nNaturalization Service\") (INS), where individual asylum officers ponder the\noften life-or-death fate of immigrants seeking asylum.\n\n## Legal perspectives\n\nUniversity of North Carolina law professor Hiroshi Motomura has identified\nthree approaches the United States has taken to the legal status of immigrants\nin his book _Americans in Waiting: The Lost Story of Immigration and\nCitizenship in the United States_. The first, dominant in the 19th century,\ntreated immigrants as in transition; in other words, as prospective citizens.\nAs soon as people declared their intention to become citizens, they received\nmultiple low-cost benefits, including the eligibility for free homesteads in\nthe [Homestead Act](/wiki/Homestead_Act \"Homestead Act\") of 1869, and in many\nstates, the right to vote. The goal was to make the country more attractive,\nso large numbers of farmers and skilled craftsmen would settle new lands. By\nthe 1880s, a second approach took over, treating newcomers as \"immigrants by\ncontract\". An implicit deal existed where immigrants who were literate and\ncould earn their own living were permitted in restricted numbers. Once in the\nUnited States, they would have limited legal rights, but were not allowed to\nvote until they became citizens, and would not be eligible for the New Deal\ngovernment benefits available in the 1930s. The third and more recent\npolicy[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_] is \"immigration by\naffiliation\", which Motomura argues is the treatment which depends on how\ndeeply rooted people have become in the country. An immigrant who applies for\ncitizenship as soon as permitted, has a long history of working in the United\nStates, and has significant family ties, is more deeply affiliated and can\nexpect better treatment.[362]\n\n## Interpretive perspectives\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Statue-de-la-liberte-\nnew-york.jpg/150px-Statue-de-la-liberte-new-york.jpg)](/wiki/File:Statue-de-\nla-liberte-new-york.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Statue-de-la-liberte-new-york.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Statue of Liberty](/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty \"Statue of Liberty\") was a\ncommon sight to many immigrants who entered the United States through [Ellis\nIsland](/wiki/Ellis_Island \"Ellis Island\")\n\nThe [American Dream](/wiki/American_Dream \"American Dream\") is the belief that\nthrough hard work and determination, any United States immigrant can achieve a\nbetter life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal\nfreedom of choice.[363] According to historians, the rapid economic and\nindustrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource\nrich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that anybody could\nget a share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work\nhard.[364] This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the\nUnited States.[365]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Demographics of the United States](/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States \"Demographics of the United States\")\n  * [Emigration from the United States](/wiki/Emigration_from_the_United_States \"Emigration from the United States\")\n  * [European colonization of the Americas](/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas \"European colonization of the Americas\")\n  * [History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States](/wiki/History_of_laws_concerning_immigration_and_naturalization_in_the_United_States \"History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States\")\n  * _[How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories](/wiki/How_Democracy_Works_Now:_Twelve_Stories \"How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories\")_\n  * [Illegal immigration to the United States](/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States \"Illegal immigration to the United States\")\n  * [Inequality within immigrant families (United States)](/wiki/Inequality_within_immigrant_families_\\(United_States\\) \"Inequality within immigrant families \\(United States\\)\")\n  * [Nativism (politics)](/wiki/Nativism_\\(politics\\) \"Nativism \\(politics\\)\"), opposition to immigration\n  * [Opposition to immigration](/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration \"Opposition to immigration\")\n  * [United States immigration statistics](/wiki/United_States_immigration_statistics \"United States immigration statistics\")\n  * [Immigrant benefits urban legend](/wiki/Immigrant_benefits_urban_legend \"Immigrant benefits urban legend\"), a hoax regarding benefits comparison\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"United Nations Population Division | Department of Economic and Social Affairs\"](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml). _www.un.org_.
