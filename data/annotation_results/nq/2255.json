dance,\ncomprises a large set of unique traditions influenced mostly by west African\nand European (especially Spanish) music.[1] Due to the syncretic nature of\nmost of its genres, Cuban music is often considered one of the richest and\nmost influential regional musics of the world. For instance, the [son\ncubano](/wiki/Son_cubano \"Son cubano\") merges an adapted Spanish guitar\n(tres), melody, harmony, and lyrical traditions with Afro-Cuban percussion and\nrhythms. Almost nothing remains of the original native traditions, since the\nnative population was exterminated in the 16th century.[2]\n\nSince the 19th century Cuban music has been hugely popular and influential\nthroughout the world. It has been perhaps the most popular form of regional\nmusic since the introduction of recording technology. Cuban music has\ncontributed to the development of a wide variety of genre and musical styles\naround the globe, most notably in [Latin America](/wiki/Latin_America \"Latin\nAmerica\"), the [Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean \"Caribbean\"), [West\nAfrica](/wiki/West_Africa \"West Africa\") and [Europe](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\").\nExamples include [rhumba](/wiki/Rhumba \"Rhumba\"), [Afro-Cuban\njazz](/wiki/Afro-Cuban_jazz \"Afro-Cuban jazz\"), [salsa](/wiki/Salsa_music\n\"Salsa music\"), [soukous](/wiki/Soukous \"Soukous\"), many West African re-\nadaptations of Afro-Cuban music ([Orchestra Baobab](/wiki/Orchestra_Baobab\n\"Orchestra Baobab\"), [Africando](/wiki/Africando \"Africando\")), Spanish fusion\ngenres (notably with [flamenco](/wiki/Flamenco \"Flamenco\")), and a wide\nvariety of genres in Latin America.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Overview\n  * 2 18th and 19th centuries\n  * 3 20th-century classical and art music\n  * 4 21st-century classical and art music\n  * 5 Electroacoustic music in Cuba\n  * 6 Classical guitar in Cuba\n    * 6.1 From the 16th to the 19th century\n    * 6.2 20th century and beyond\n    * 6.3 Modern Cuban Guitar School\n    * 6.4 New generations\n  * 7 Classical piano in Cuba\n  * 8 Classical violin in Cuba\n    * 8.1 From the 16th to the 18th century\n    * 8.2 From the 18th to the 19th century\n    * 8.3 From the 20th to the 21st century\n    * 8.4 21st century\n  * 9 Opera in Cuba\n    * 9.1 The 19th century\n    * 9.2 From 1901 to 1959\n    * 9.3 From 1960 to present time\n  * 10 Musicology in Cuba\n  * 11 Popular music\n    * 11.1 Hispanic heritage\n  * 12 Música campesina (peasant music)\n    * 12.1 Punto guajiro\n    * 12.2 Zapateo\n    * 12.3 Guajira\n    * 12.4 Criolla\n  * 13 African heritage\n    * 13.1 Origins of Cuban African groups\n    * 13.2 Subsequent organization\n    * 13.3 African sacred music in Cuba\n    * 13.4 Yoruba and Congolese rituals\n    * 13.5 Clave\n    * 13.6 Cuban Carnival\n    * 13.7 Tumba francesa\n  * 14 Contradanza\n  * 15 Danza\n  * 16 Habanera\n  * 17 Danzón\n  * 18 Danzonete\n  * 19 Guaracha\n  * 20 Musical theatre\n  * 21 Zarzuela\n  * 22 Bufo theatre\n  * 23 Other theatrical forms\n  * 24 The Black Curros (Negros Curros)\n  * 25 Rumba\n  * 26 Rumba and guaracha\n  * 27 Urban rumba\n  * 28 Coros de Clave\n  * 29 Rural rumba\n    * 29.1 Characteristics of the rural rumba\n  * 30 Proto-son\n    * 30.1 Nengón\n    * 30.2 Changüí\n    * 30.3 Sucu-Sucu\n  * 31 Trova\n    * 31.1 Bolero\n    * 31.2 Canción\n  * 32 Tropical waltz\n  * 33 Son\n  * 34 Cuban jazz\n    * 34.1 Early Cuban jazz bands\n  * 35 Afro-Cuban jazz\n  * 36 Diversification and popularization\n    * 36.1 Cuban music enters the United States\n    * 36.2 1940s and '50s\n      * 36.2.1 The big band era\n      * 36.2.2 Cuban music in the US\n  * 37 Mambo\n  * 38 Chachachá\n  * 39 Filin\n  * 40 1960s and 70s\n    * 40.1 Revolutionary Cuba and Cuban exiles\n    * 40.2 Salsa\n    * 40.3 Nueva Trova\n  * 41 1980s to the present\n    * 41.1 Timba\n    * 41.2 Revival projects\n    * 41.3 Hip hop\n    * 41.4 Cubatón\n  * 42 Rock music in Cuba\n  * 43 References\n  * 44 Sources\n  * 45 External links\n\n## Overview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Overview\")]\n\nLarge numbers of African slaves and European, mostly Spanish, immigrants came\nto [Cuba](/wiki/Cuba \"Cuba\") and brought their own forms of music to the\nisland. European dances and folk musics included [zapateo](/wiki/Zapateo\n\"Zapateo\"), [fandango](/wiki/Fandango_\\(dance\\) \"Fandango \\(dance\\)\"), [paso\ndoble](/wiki/Paso_doble \"Paso doble\") and [retambico](/wiki/Retambico\n\"Retambico\"). Later, northern European forms like [minuet](/wiki/Minuet\n\"Minuet\"), [gavotte](/wiki/Gavotte \"Gavotte\"), [mazurka](/wiki/Mazurka\n\"Mazurka\"), [contradanza](/wiki/Contradanza \"Contradanza\"), and the\n[waltz](/wiki/Waltz \"Waltz\") appeared among urban whites. There was also an\nimmigration of Chinese [indentured](/wiki/Indentured \"Indentured\") laborers\nlater in the 19th century.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Panorama_of_La_Habana_%28Amsterdam%2C_17th_century%29.jpg/225px-\nPanorama_of_La_Habana_%28Amsterdam%2C_17th_century%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Panorama_of_La_Habana_\\(Amsterdam,_17th_century\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Panorama_of_La_Habana_\\(Amsterdam,_17th_century\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAncient print of colonial Havana\n\n[Fernando Ortiz](/wiki/Fernando_Ortiz_Fern%C3%A1ndez \"Fernando Ortiz\nFernández\"), the first great Cuban folklorist, described Cuba's musical\ninnovations as arising from the interplay ('transculturation') between African\nslaves settled on large [sugar](/wiki/Sugar \"Sugar\")\n[plantations](/wiki/Plantation \"Plantation\") and Spaniards from different\nregions such as Andalusia and [Canary Islands](/wiki/Canary_Islands \"Canary\nIslands\"). The African slaves and their descendants made many percussion\ninstruments and preserved rhythms they had known in their homeland.[3] The\nmost important instruments were the drums, of which there were originally\nabout fifty different types; today only the [bongos](/wiki/Bongos \"Bongos\"),\n[congas](/wiki/Congas \"Congas\") and [batá](/wiki/Bat%C3%A1 \"Batá\") drums are\nregularly seen (the [timbales](/wiki/Timbales \"Timbales\") are descended from\nkettle drums in Spanish military bands). Also important are the\n[claves](/wiki/Claves \"Claves\"), two short hardwood batons, and the\n[cajón](/wiki/Caj%C3%B3n \"Cajón\"), a wooden box, originally made from crates.\nClaves are still used often, and wooden boxes (_cajones_) were widely used\nduring periods when the drum was banned. In addition, there are other\npercussion instruments in use for African-origin religious ceremonies. Chinese\nimmigrants contributed the _[corneta china](/wiki/Corneta_china \"Corneta\nchina\")_ (Chinese cornet), a [Chinese reed instrument](/wiki/Chinese_music\n\"Chinese music\") still played in the [comparsas](/wiki/Comparsa \"Comparsa\"),\nor [carnival](/wiki/Carnival \"Carnival\") groups, of [Santiago de\nCuba](/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba \"Santiago de Cuba\").\n\nThe great instrumental contribution of the Spanish was their\n[guitar](/wiki/Guitar \"Guitar\"), but even more important was the tradition of\nEuropean [musical notation](/wiki/Musical_notation \"Musical notation\") and\ntechniques of [musical composition](/wiki/Musical_composition \"Musical\ncomposition\"). Hernando de la Parra's archives give some of our earliest\navailable information on Cuban music. He reported instruments including the\n[clarinet](/wiki/Clarinet \"Clarinet\"), [violin](/wiki/Violin \"Violin\") and\n[vihuela](/wiki/Vihuela \"Vihuela\"). There were few professional musicians at\nthe time, and fewer still of their songs survive. One of the earliest is _Ma\nTeodora_ , supposed to be related to a freed slave, [Teodora\nGinés](/wiki/Teodora_Gin%C3%A9s \"Teodora Ginés\") of Santiago de Cuba, who was\nfamous for her compositions. The piece is said to be similar to 16th-, 17th-\nand 18th-century Spanish popular songs and dances.[4]\n\nCuban music has its principal roots in Spain and West Africa, but over time\nhas been influenced by diverse genres from different countries. Important\namong these are France (and its colonies in the Americas), and the United\nStates.\n\nCuban music has been immensely influential[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] in\nother countries. It contributed not only to the development of\n[jazz](/wiki/Jazz \"Jazz\") and [salsa](/wiki/Salsa_music \"Salsa music\"), but\nalso to the Argentine [tango](/wiki/Tango_music \"Tango music\"), Ghanaian\n[high-life](/wiki/Highlife \"Highlife\"), West African [Afrobeat](/wiki/Afrobeat\n\"Afrobeat\"), Dominican [Bachata](/wiki/Bachata_\\(music\\) \"Bachata \\(music\\)\")\nand [Merengue](/wiki/Merengue_music \"Merengue music\"), Colombian\n[Cumbia](/wiki/Cumbia \"Cumbia\") and Spanish Nuevo [flamenco](/wiki/Flamenco\n\"Flamenco\") and to the Arabo-Cuban music ([Hanine Y Son\nCubano](/wiki/Hanine_Y_Son_Cubano \"Hanine Y Son Cubano\"))[5] developed by\n[Michel Elefteriades](/wiki/Michel_Elefteriades \"Michel Elefteriades\") in the\n1990s.\n\nThe African beliefs and practices certainly influenced Cuba's music.\nPolyrhythmic [percussion](/wiki/Percussion_instrument \"Percussion instrument\")\nis an inherent part of African music, as melody is part of European music.\nAlso, in African tradition, percussion is always joined to song and dance, and\nto a particular social setting.[6] The result of the meeting of European and\nAfrican cultures is that most Cuban popular music is creolized. This\ncreolization of Cuban life has been happening for a long time, and by the 20th\ncentury, elements of African belief, music and dance were well integrated into\npopular and folk forms.\n\n## 18th and 19th\ncenturies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: 18th and 19th centuries\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Saumell.jpg/120px-\nSaumell.jpg)](/wiki/File:Saumell.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Saumell.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nManuel Saumell\n\nAmong internationally heralded composers of the \"serious\" genre can be counted\nthe Baroque composer [Esteban Salas y Castro](/wiki/Esteban_Salas_y_Castro\n\"Esteban Salas y Castro\") (1725–1803), who spent much of his life teaching and\nwriting music for the Church.[7] He was followed in the Cathedral of Santiago\nde Cuba by the priest [Juan París](/wiki/Juan_Par%C3%ADs \"Juan París\")\n(1759–1845). París was an exceptionally industrious man, and an important\ncomposer. He encouraged continuous and diverse musical events.[8]p181 Aside\nfrom rural music and Afro-Cuban folk music, the most popular kind of urban\nCreole dance music in the 19th century was the contradanza, which commenced as\na local form of the English country dance and the derivative French\ncontredanse and Spanish contradanza. While many contradanzas were written for\ndance, from the mid-century several were written as light-classical parlor\npieces for piano. The first distinguished composer in this style was [Manuel\nSaumell](/wiki/Manuel_Saumell \"Manuel Saumell\") (1818–1870), who is sometimes\naccordingly hailed as the father of Cuban creole musical development.\nAccording to Helio Orovio, \"After Saumell's visionary work, all that was left\nto do was to develop his innovations, all of which profoundly influenced the\nhistory of Cuban nationalist musical movements.\"[9]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Ignacio_Cervantes.jpg/150px-\nIgnacio_Cervantes.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ignacio_Cervantes.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ignacio_Cervantes.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIgnacio Cervantes\n\nIn the hands of his successor, [Ignacio Cervantes](/wiki/Ignacio_Cervantes\n\"Ignacio Cervantes\") Kawanagh, the piano idiom related to the contradanza\nachieved even greater sophistication. Cervantes was called by [Aaron\nCopland](/wiki/Aaron_Copland \"Aaron Copland\") a \"Cuban [Chopin](/wiki/Chopin\n\"Chopin\")\" because of his Chopinesque piano compositions. Cervantes'\nreputation today rests almost solely upon his famous forty-one _Danzas\nCubanas_ , which Carpentier said, \"...occupy the place that the _Norwegian\nDances_ of [Grieg](/wiki/Grieg \"Grieg\") or the _Slavic Dances_ of\n[Dvořák](/wiki/Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k \"Antonín Dvořák\") occupy in the\nmusics of their respective countries\". Cervantes' never-finished opera,\n_Maledetto_ , is forgotten.[8]\n\nIn the 1840s, the habanera emerged as a languid vocal song using the\ncontradanza rhythm. (Non-Cubans sometimes called Cuban contradanzas\n\"habaneras.\") The habanera went on to become popular in Spain and elsewhere.\nThe Cuban contradanza/danza was also an important influence on the Puerto\nRican danza, which went on to enjoy its own dynamic and distinctive career\nlasting through the 1930s. In Cuba, in the 1880s the contradanza/danza gave\nbirth to the danzón, which effectively superseded it in popularity.[10]\n\n[Laureano Fuentes](/wiki/Laureano_Fuentes \"Laureano Fuentes\") (1825–1898) came\nfrom a family of musicians and wrote the first opera to be composed on the\nisland, _La hija de Jefté_ (Jefte's daughter). This was later lengthened and\nstaged under the title _Seila_. His numerous works spanned all genres. [Gaspar\nVillate](/wiki/Gaspar_Villate \"Gaspar Villate\") (1851–1891) produced abundant\nand wide-ranging work, all centered on opera.[8]p239 [José\nWhite](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_White \"José White\") (1836–1918), a mulatto of a Spanish\nfather and an Afrocuban mother, was a composer and a violinist of\ninternational merit. He learned to play sixteen instruments, and lived,\nvariously, in Cuba, Latin America and Paris. His most famous work is _La bella\ncubana_ , a habanera.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Appletons%27_Gottschalk_Louis_Moreau.jpg/120px-\nAppletons%27_Gottschalk_Louis_Moreau.jpg)](/wiki/File:Appletons%27_Gottschalk_Louis_Moreau.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Appletons%27_Gottschalk_Louis_Moreau.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nL. M. Gottschalk\n\nDuring the middle years of the 19th century, a young American musician came to\nHavana: [Louis Moreau Gottschalk](/wiki/Louis_Moreau_Gottschalk \"Louis Moreau\nGottschalk\") (1829–1869), whose father was a Jewish businessman from London,\nand his mother a white creole of French Catholic background.[11] Gottschalk\nwas brought up mostly by his black grandmother and nurse Sally, both from\n[Saint-Domingue](/wiki/Saint-Domingue \"Saint-Domingue\"). He was a piano\nprodigy who had listened to the music and seen the dancing in [Congo\nSquare](/wiki/Congo_Square \"Congo Square\"), [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans\n\"New Orleans\") from childhood. His period in Cuba lasted from 1853 to 1862,\nwith visits to [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico \"Puerto Rico\") and\n[Martinique](/wiki/Martinique \"Martinique\") squeezed in. He composed many\ncreolized pieces, such as the habanera _[Bamboula, Op.\n2](/wiki/Bamboula,_Op._2_\\(Gottschalk\\) \"Bamboula, Op. 2 \\(Gottschalk\\)\")_\n(Danse de negres) (1845), the title referring to a bass Afro-Caribbean drum;\n_El cocoye_ (1853), a version of a rhythmic melody already present in Cuba;\nthe contradanza _Ojos criollos (Danse cubaine)_ (1859) and a version of _María\nde la O_ , which refers to a Cuban mulatto singer. These numbers made use of\ntypical Cuban rhythmic patterns. At one of his farewell concerts he played his\n_Adiós a Cuba_ to huge applause and shouts of 'bravo!' Unfortunately, his\nscore for the work has not survived.[12] In February 1860 Gottschalk produced\na huge work _La nuit des tropiques_ in Havana. The work used about 250\nmusicians and a choir of 200 singers plus a [tumba\nfrancesa](/wiki/Tumba_francesa \"Tumba francesa\") group from [Santiago de\nCuba](/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba \"Santiago de Cuba\"). He produced another huge\nconcert the following year, with new material. These shows probably dwarfed\nanything seen in the island before or since, and no doubt were unforgettable\nfor those who attended.[13]p147\n\n## 20th-century classical and art\nmusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: 20th-century classical and art music\")]\n\n\"[Amadeo Roldán](/wiki/Amadeo_Rold%C3%A1n \"Amadeo Roldán\") (1900–1939) and\n[Alejandro García Caturla](/wiki/Alejandro_Garc%C3%ADa_Caturla \"Alejandro\nGarcía Caturla\") (1906–1940) were Cuba's symphonic revolutionaries [though]\ntheir music is rarely played today\".[13]p354 They both played a part in\n[Afrocubanismo](/wiki/Afrocubanismo \"Afrocubanismo\"): the movement in black-\nthemed Cuban culture with origins in the 1920s, and extensively analysed by\n[Fernando Ortiz](/wiki/Fernando_Ortiz_Fern%C3%A1ndez \"Fernando Ortiz\nFernández\"). Roldan, born in Paris to a Cuban mulatta and a Spanish father,\ncame to Cuba in 1919 and became the concert-master (first-chair violin) of the\nnew _Orquesta Sinfónica de La Habana_ in 1922. There he met Caturla, at\nsixteen a second violin. Roldan's compositions included _Overture on Cuban\nthemes_ (1925), and two ballets: _La Rebambaramba_ (1928) and _El milagro de\nAnaquille_ (1929). There followed a series of _Ritmicas_ and _Poema negra_\n(1930) and _Tres toques_ (march, rites, dance) (1931).

This first composition, titled\n\"Musica Para Danza\", was produced with just an oscillator and three common\ntape recorders. As a result of the enormous scarcity generated by the Cuban\nRevolution since its origins in 1959, access to the necessary technological\nresources to produce electroacoustic music was always very limited for anyone\ninterested. For this reason, it was not until 1969 that another Cuban\ncomposer, [Sergio Barroso](/wiki/Sergio_Barroso \"Sergio Barroso\"), dedicated\nhimself to the creation of electroacoustic musical compositions.\n\nIn 1970, [Juan Blanco](/wiki/Juan_Blanco \"Juan Blanco\") began to work as a\nmusic advisor for the Department of Propaganda of ICAP (Insituto Cubano de\nAmistad con Los Pueblos). In this capacity, he created electroacoustic music\nfor all the audiovisual materials produced by ICAP. After nine years working\nwithout restitution, Blanco finally obtained financing to set up an\nElectroacoustic Studio to be used for his work. He was appointed as Director\nof the Studio, but under the condition that he should be the only one to use\nthe facility.\n\nAfter a few months, and without asking for permission, he opened the\nElectroacoustic Studio to all composers interested in working with\nelectroacoustic technology, thus creating the ICAP Electroacoustsic Music\nWorkshop (TIME), where he himself provided training to all participants. In\n1990, the ICAP Workshop changed its name to Laboratorio Nacional de Música\nElectroacústica (LNME) and its main objective was to support and promote the\nwork of Cuban electroaocustic composers and sound artists.\n\nSome years later, another electroacoustic music studio was created at the\n[Instituto Superior de Arte](/wiki/Instituto_Superior_de_Arte \"Instituto\nSuperior de Arte\") (ISA).

From\nthe 16th to the 18th century some danceable songs that emerged in Spain were\nassociated to Hispanic America, or considered as been originated in America.\nSome of these songs with picturesque names such as Sarabande, Chaconne,\nZambapalo, Retambico and Gurrumbé, among others,[82] shared a common trait,\nits characteristic rhythm called Hemiola or Sesquiáltera (in Spain).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/3_over_2.png/220px-3_over_2.png)](/wiki/File:3_over_2.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:3_over_2.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nVertical hemiola.

Although the first printed sample of a Cuban\nCreole Zapateo (Zapateo Criollo) was not published until 1855 in the \"Álbum\nRegio of Vicente Díaz de Comas\",[87] it is possible to find references about\nthe existence of those genres since long time before.[88] Its structural\ncharacteristics have survived almost unaltered through a period of more than\ntwo hundred years and they are usually considered the most typically Hispanic\nCuban popular music genres. Cuban musicologists María Teresa Linares,\nArgeliers León and Rolando Antonio Pérez coincide in thinking that Punto and\nZapateo are based on Spanish dance –songs (such as chacone and sarabande) that\narrived first at the most important population centers such as Havana and\nSantiago de Cuba and then spread throughout the surrounding rural areas where\nthey were adopted and modified by the peasant (campesino) population at a\nlater time.[87]\n\n### Punto\nguajiro[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit\nsection: Punto guajiro\")]\n\nPunto guajiro or [Punto Cubano](/wiki/Punto_Cubano \"Punto Cubano\"), or simply\nPunto is a sung genre of Cuban music, an improvised poetic-music art that\nemerged in the western and central regions of Cuba during the 17th\ncentury.[89] Although Punto appears to come from an Andalusian origin, it is a\ntrue Cuban genre because of its creole modifications.[90]\n\nPunto is played by a group with various types of plucked string instruments:\nthe tiple (a treble guitar currently in disuse), the Spanish guitar, the Cuban\ntres, and the laúd. The word punto refers to the use of a plucked technique\n(punteado), rather than strumming (rasgueado). Also some percussion\ninstruments have been utilized such as the clave, the güiro and the guayo ( a\nmetallic scraper). Singers gather themselves in contending teams, and\nimprovise their lines.\n\nThey sing fixed melodies called \"tonadas\" which are based on a meter of ten\nstrophe verses called \"décimas\", with intervals between stanzas to give the\nsingers some time to prepare the next verse.[91] Early compositions were\nsometimes recorded and published, as were the names of some of the singers and\ncomposers. Beginning around 1935, Punto reached a peak of popularity on Cuban\nradio.\n\nPunto was one of the first Cuban genres recorded by American companies at the\nbeginning of the 20th century, but at a later time the interest decayed and\nlittle effort was made to continue recording the live radio performances. A\nfan of this genre, stenographer Aida Bode, wrote down many verses as they were\nbroadcast and finally, in 1997, her transcriptions were published in book\nform.[92]\n\nCelina González and Albita Rodríguez both sang Punto at the beginning of their\ncareers, proving that the genre is still alive.

Compared to the US, slavery started in Cuba much earlier\nand continued for decades afterwards. Cuba was the last country in the\nAmericas to abolish the importation of slaves, and the second last to free the\nslaves. In 1807 the [British Parliament](/wiki/British_Parliament \"British\nParliament\") outlawed slavery, and from then on the [British\nNavy](/wiki/British_Navy \"British Navy\") acted to intercept Portuguese and\nSpanish slave ships. By 1860 the trade with Cuba was almost extinguished; the\nlast slave ship to Cuba was in 1873. The abolition of slavery was announced by\nthe [Spanish Crown](/wiki/Spanish_Crown \"Spanish Crown\") in 1880, and put into\neffect in 1886. Two years later, Brazil abolished slavery.[96]\n\n### Subsequent\norganization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Subsequent organization\")]\n\nThe roots of most Afro-Cuban musical forms lie in the\n[cabildos](/wiki/Cabildo_\\(Cuba\\) \"Cabildo \\(Cuba\\)\"), self-organized social\nclubs for the African slaves, separate cabildos for separate cultures. The\ncabildos were formed mainly from four groups: the Yoruba (the Lucumi in Cuba);\nthe [Congolese](/wiki/Kongo_people \"Kongo people\") (Palo in Cuba);\n[Dahomey](/wiki/Dahomey \"Dahomey\") (the Fon or Arará). Other cultures were\nundoubtedly present, more even than listed above, but in smaller numbers, and\nthey did not leave such a distinctive presence.\n\nCabildos preserved African cultural traditions, even after the [abolition of\nslavery](/wiki/Abolitionism \"Abolitionism\") in 1886. At the same time, African\nreligions were transmitted from generation to generation throughout Cuba,\nHaiti, other islands and Brazil. These religions, which had a similar but not\nidentical structure, were known as _Lucumi_ or _Regla de Ocha_ if they derived\nfrom the [Yoruba](/wiki/Yoruba_religion \"Yoruba religion\"),\n_[Palo](/wiki/Palo_\\(religion\\) \"Palo \\(religion\\)\")_ from [Central\nAfrica](/wiki/Central_Africa \"Central Africa\"), _Vodú_ from\n[Haiti](/wiki/Haiti \"Haiti\"), and so on. The term _Santería_ was first\nintroduced to account for the way African spirits were joined to Catholic\nsaints, especially by people who were both baptized and initiated, and so were\ngenuinely members of both groups. Outsiders picked up the word and have tended\nto use it somewhat indiscriminately. It has become a kind of catch-all word,\nrather like salsa in music.[13]p171; p258\n\n### African sacred music in\nCuba[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit\nsection: African sacred music in Cuba\")]\n\nAll these African cultures had musical traditions, which survive erratically\nto the present day, not always in detail, but in general style. The best\npreserved are the African polytheistic religions, where, in Cuba at least, the\ninstruments, the language, the chants, the dances and their interpretations\nare quite well preserved. In what other American countries are the religious\nceremonies conducted in the old language(s) of Africa? They certainly are in\nLucumí ceremonies, though of course, back in Africa the language has moved on.\nWhat unifies all genuine forms of African music is the unity of polyrhythmic\npercussion, voice (call-and-response) and dance in well-defined social\nsettings, and the absence of melodic instruments of an Arabic or European\nkind.\n\n### Yoruba and Congolese\nrituals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit\nsection: Yoruba and Congolese rituals\")]\n\nMain articles: [Yoruba people](/wiki/Yoruba_people \"Yoruba people\"), [Lucumi\nreligion](/wiki/Lucumi_religion \"Lucumi religion\"), [Kongo\npeople](/wiki/Kongo_people \"Kongo people\"), [Palo\n(religion)](/wiki/Palo_\\(religion\\) \"Palo \\(religion\\)\"), and\n[Batá](/wiki/Bat%C3%A1 \"Batá\")\n\nReligious traditions of African origin have survived in Cuba, and are the\nbasis of ritual music, song and dance quite distinct from the secular music\nand dance.

[Conga\ndrums](/wiki/Conga \"Conga\") are played (along with other typical instruments)\nin comparsas of all kinds. Santiago de Cuba and Havana were the two main\ncenters for street carnivals.

It embodies one of the oldest and most tangible links to the Afro-\nHaitian heritage of Cuba's Oriente province and developed from an eighteenth-\ncentury fusion of music from Dahomey in [West Africa](/wiki/West_Africa \"West\nAfrica\") and traditional [French](/wiki/France \"France\") dances. This fossil\ngenre survives to the present day in [Santiago de Cuba](/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba\n\"Santiago de Cuba\") and Haiti, performed by specialized folk ensembles.\n\n## Contradanza[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=37\n\"Edit section: Contradanza\")]\n\nMain article: [Contradanza](/wiki/Contradanza \"Contradanza\")\n\nThe Contradanza is an important precursor of several later popular dances. It\narrived in Cuba in the late 18th century from Europe where it had been\ndeveloped first as the English country dance, and then as the French\ncontradanse. The origin of the word is a corruption of the English term\n\"country dance\".[101] [Manuel Saumell](/wiki/Manuel_Saumell \"Manuel Saumell\")\nwrote over fifty contradanzas (in 2/4 or 6/8 time), in which his rhythmic and\nmelodic inventiveness was astonishing.\n\nThe Contradanza is a communal sequence dance, with the dance figures\nconforming to a set pattern. The selection of figures for a particular dance\nwas usually set by a master of ceremonies or dance leader. There were two\nparts of 16 bars each, danced in a line or square format. The tempo and style\nof the music was bright and fairly fast.\n\nThe earliest Cuban creole composition of a Contradanza appeared published in\nHavana in 1803 and was named _San Pascual bailón_. This version shows for the\nfirst time the well known rhythm of \"Tango\" or \"Habanera\" which differentiates\nit from the European contradance. The Cubans developed a number of creolized\nversion, such as the \"paseo\", \"cadena\", \"sostenido\" and \"cedazo\". This\ncreolization is an early example of the influence of the African traditions in\nthe Caribbean. Most of the musicians were black or mulatto (even early in the\n19th century there were many freed slaves and mixed race persons living in\nCuban towns). \"The women of Havana have a furious taste for dancing; they\nspend entire nights elevated, agitated, crazy and pouring sweat until they\nfall spent.\"[102]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Basic_habanera_rhythm%2C_Orovio_1981_237.png/150px-\nBasic_habanera_rhythm%2C_Orovio_1981_237.png)](/wiki/File:Basic_habanera_rhythm,_Orovio_1981_237.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Basic_habanera_rhythm,_Orovio_1981_237.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nRhythm of Tango or Habanera.

It was also a brisk form of music and dance in double or triple time.\nA repeated 8-bar paseo was followed by two 16-bar sections called the primera\nand segunda. One famous composer of danzas was [Ignacio\nCervantes](/wiki/Ignacio_Cervantes \"Ignacio Cervantes\"), whose forty-one\ndanzas cubanas were a landmark in musical nationalism. This type of dance was\neventually replaced by the danzón, which was, like the habanera, much slower\nand more sedate.[104]\n\n## Habanera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=39\n\"Edit section: Habanera\")]\n\nMain article: [Habanera (music)](/wiki/Habanera_\\(music\\) \"Habanera\n\\(music\\)\")\n\nThe [habanera](/wiki/Habanera_\\(music\\) \"Habanera \\(music\\)\") developed out of\nthe [contradanza](/wiki/Contradanza \"Contradanza\") in the early 19th century.\nIts great novelty was that it was _sung_ , as well as played and danced.\nWritten in 2/4 meter, the Habanera is characterized by an expressive and\nlanguid melodious development and its characteristic rhythm called \"Habanera\nRhythm.\"\n\nThe dance style of the habanera is slower and more stately than the danza. By\nthe 1840s habaneras were written, sung, and danced in Mexico, Venezuela,\nPuerto Rico, and Spain.[105] Since about 1900 the habanera has been a relic\ndance; but the music has a period charm, and there are some famous\ncompositions, such as _Tú_ from Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes, which has been\nrecorded in many versions.\n\nVersions of habanera-type compositions have appeared in the music of\n[Ravel](/wiki/Ravel \"Ravel\"), [Bizet](/wiki/Bizet \"Bizet\"), [Saint-\nSaëns](/wiki/Saint-Sa%C3%ABns \"Saint-Saëns\"), [Debussy](/wiki/Debussy\n\"Debussy\"), [Fauré](/wiki/Gabriel_Faur%C3%A9 \"Gabriel Fauré\"),\n[Albeniz](/wiki/Albeniz \"Albeniz\").

It is a descendent of the creollized Cuban\n[contradanza](/wiki/Contradanza \"Contradanza\"). The danzón marks the change\nfrom the communal sequence dance style of the late 18th century to the couple\ndances of later times. The stimulus for this was the success of the once-\nscandalous [walz](/wiki/Waltz \"Waltz\"), where couples danced facing each\nother, independently from other couples and not as part of a pre-set\nstructure. The danzón was the first Cuban dance to adopt such methods, though\nthere is a difference between the two dances. The walz is a progressive\nballroom dance where couples move round the floor in an anti-clockwise\ndirection; the danzón is a 'pocket-handkerchief' dance where a couple stays\nwithin a small area of the floor.[107]\n\nThe [danzón](/wiki/Danz%C3%B3n \"Danzón\") was developed by [Miguel\nFaílde](/wiki/Miguel_Fa%C3%ADlde \"Miguel Faílde\") in [Matanzas](/wiki/Matanzas\n\"Matanzas\"), the official date of origin being 1879.[108] Failde's was an\n[orquesta típica](/wiki/Orquesta_t%C3%ADpica \"Orquesta típica\"), a form\nderived from military bands, using brass, kettle-drums etc. The later\ndevelopment of the charanga was more suited to the indoor salon and is an\norchestral format still popular today in Cuba and some other countries.

Born from Spanish parents in the Mexican\nlocality of Mérida, Yucatán in 1904, she died in Miami in 1999. Maruja\nGonzález Linares travelled from Cuba to the US at a very young age. She\nstudied vocal techniques in Cuba, where she made her debut in 1929 as a\nlyrical singer in the Company of Maestro Ernesto Lecuona. Maruja González\nperformed in several theaters of Havana before going on a tour through the\nUnited States and upon her return to Havana she sang La Bayadere and the Merry\nWidow in the same city.

Bufo had\nits origin around 1800-15 as an older form, _[tonadilla](/wiki/Tonadilla\n\"Tonadilla\")_ , began to vanish from Havana. **Francisco Covarrubias** the\n'caricaturist' (1775–1850) was its creator. Gradually, the comic types threw\noff their European models and became more and more creolized and Cuban.\nAlongside, the music followed. Argot from slave barracks and poor barrios\nfound its way into lyrics that are those of the [guaracha](/wiki/Guaracha\n\"Guaracha\"):\n\n    \n\n    Una mulata me ha muerto!\n    Y no prenden a esa mulata?\n    Como ha de quedar hombre vivo\n    si no prenden a quien mata!\n\n    \n\n    La mulata es como el pan;\n    se debe comer caliente,\n    que en dejandola enfriar\n    ni el diablo le mete el diente![8]p218\n\n    \n\n    (A mulata's done for me!\n    What's more, they don't arrest her!\n    How can any man live\n    If they don't take this killer?\n\n    \n\n    A mulatta is like fresh bread\n    You gotta eat it while it's hot\n    If you leave it till it's cool\n    Even the devil can't get a bite!)\n\nThe \"guaracha\" occupied a predominant place within the development of\nvernacular theater in Cuba, which appearance at the beginning of the 19th\ncentury coincides with the emergence of the first autochthonous Cuban musical\ngenres, the \"guaracha\" and the\"contradanza.\". Since 1812, Francisco\nCovarrubias (considered as the father of the Bufo Theater) gradually\nsubstituted in his theatrical pieces the typical characters of the Spanish\n\"tonadilla escénica\" with creole characters such as \"guajiros\", \"monteros\",\n\"carreteros\" or \"peones\". Those structural transformations were also\nassociated to certain changes in the musical background of the pieces. Thus,\nthe Spanish genres such as \"jácaras\", \"tiranas\", \"boleras\" or \"villancicos\",\nwere substituted by \"guarachas\", \"décimas\" and \"canciones cubanas.\"[111]\n\n## Other theatrical\nforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=46 \"Edit\nsection: Other theatrical forms\")]\n\nVernacular theatre of various types often includes music. Formats rather like\nthe British [Music Hall](/wiki/Music_Hall \"Music Hall\"), or the American\n[Vaudeville](/wiki/Vaudeville \"Vaudeville\"), still occur, where an audience is\ntreated to a [potpourri](/wiki/Potpourri \"Potpourri\") of singers, comedians,\nbands, sketches and speciality acts. Even in cinemas during the silent movies,\nsingers and instrumentalists appeared in the interval, and a pianist played\nduring the films.

According to Carlos\nNoreña, she was well known for the use of burato shawls of meticulous work and\nplaited fringes, for which they used to pay from nine to ten ounces of gold\",\nas well as by the typical clacking (chancleteo) they produced with their\nwooden slippers.[121]\n\nBut the Curros also provided entertainment, including songs and dances to the\nthousands of Spanish men that came to the Island every year in the ships that\nfollowed the \"Carrera de Indias\", a route established by the Spanish Crown for\ntheir galleons in order to avoid attacks from pirates and privateers, and\nstayed for months until they returned to the Port of Seville.\n\nBeing subject to the influence of both the Spanish and the African culture\nfrom birth, they are supposed to have played an important role in the\ncreolization of the Spanish song-dances original proto-type (copla-estribillo)\nthat originated the Cuban Guaracha. The Black curro and the Mulata de Rumbo\n(Black Curra) disappeared since the mid 19th century by integrating to the\nHavana general population, but their picturesque images survived in social\nprototypes manifested in the characters of the Bufo Theater.[122]\n\nThe famous \"Mulatas de Rumbo\" (mulatto characters) Juana Chambicú and María La\nO, as well as the black \"cheches\" (bullies) José Caliente \"who rips in half\nthose who oppose him,\"[123] Candela, \"negrito that flies and cuts with the\nknife,\" as well as the Black Curro Juán Cocuyo, were strongly linked to the\ncharacteristic image of the Black Curro and to the ambiance of the Guaracha\nand the Rumba.[124]\n\n## Rumba[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=48 \"Edit\nsection: Rumba\")]\n\nMain articles: [Rumba](/wiki/Rumba \"Rumba\") and [Cuban\nrumba](/wiki/Cuban_rumba \"Cuban rumba\")\n\nThe word Rumba is an abstract term that has been applied with different\npurposes to a wide variety of subjects for a very long time. From a semantic\npoint of view, the term rumba is included in a group of words with similar\nmeaning such as conga, milonga, bomba, tumba, samba, bamba, mambo, tambo,\ntango, cumbé, cumbia and candombe. All of them denote a Congolese origin due\nto the utilization of sound combinations such as, mb, ng and nd, that are\ntypical of the Niger-Congo linguistic complex.[125]\n\nMaybe the most ancient and general of its meanings is that of a feast or\n\"holgorio\". As far as the second half of the 19th century, this word can be\nfound used several times to represent a feast in a short story called \"La\nmulata de rumbo\", from the Cuban folklorist Francisco de Paula Gelabert: \"...I\nhave more enjoyment and fun in a rumbita with those of my color and class...\",\nor \" Leocadia was going to bed, as I was telling you, nothing less than at\ntwelve noon, when one of his friends from the rumbas arrived, along with\nanother young man that he wanted to introduce to her…\"[126] According to Alejo\nCarpentier \"…it is significant that the word rumba have passed to the Cuban\nlanguage as a synonym of holgorio, lewd dance, merrymaking with low class\nwomen (mujeres del rumbo).\"[127]\n\nAs an example, In the case of the Yuka, Makuta and Changüí feasts in Cuba, as\nwell as the Milonga and the Tango in Argentina, the word rumba was originally\nutilized to nominate a festive gathering; and after some time it was used to\nname the musical and dance genres that were played at those gatherings.\n\nAmong many others, some ultizations of the term \"rumba include a cover-all\nterm for faster Cuban music which started in the early 1930s with _[The Peanut\nVendor](/wiki/The_Peanut_Vendor \"The Peanut Vendor\")_. This term was replaced\nduring the 70s by [salsa](/wiki/Salsa_\\(music\\) \"Salsa \\(music\\)\"), which is\nalso a cover-all term for marketing the Cuban music and other Hispano-\nCaribbean genres to non-Cubans. In the international Latin-American dance\nsyllabus rumba is a misnomer for the slow Cuban rhythm more accurately called\nbolero-son.\n\n## Rumba and\nguaracha[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=49 \"Edit\nsection: Rumba and guaracha\")]\n\nSome scholars have pointed out that in reference to the utilization of the\nterms rumba and guaracha, there is possibly a case of\n[synonymy](/wiki/Synonymy \"Synonymy\"), or the use of two different words to\ndenominate the same thing. According to María Teresa Linares: \"… during the\nfirst years of the 20th century, there were used at the end of the vernacular\n(Bufo) theater plays some musical fragments that the authors sang, and that\nwere called closing rumba (rumba final)…\" and she continues explaining that\nthose (rumbas) \"...were certainly guarachas.\"[128] The musical pieces used to\nclose those plays may have been indistinctly called rumbas or guarachas,\nbecause those terms didn't denote any generic or structural difference between\nthem. Linares also said in reference to this subject: \"Some recordings of\nguarachas and rumbas have been preserved that do not differentiate between\nthem in the guitar parts – when it was a small group, duo or trio, or by the\ntheater orchestra or a piano. The labels of the recordings stated: dialogue\nand rumba (diálogo y rumba).\"[128]\n\n## Urban rumba[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=50\n\"Edit section: Urban rumba\")]\n\nMain article: [Rumba (de solar o de\ncajón)](/wiki/Rumba_\\(de_solar_o_de_caj%C3%B3n\\) \"Rumba \\(de solar o de\ncajón\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Latin_Conga_drum.jpg/200px-\nLatin_Conga_drum.jpg)](/wiki/File:Latin_Conga_drum.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Latin_Conga_drum.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRumba drummer\n\nUrban rumba (also called [Rumba (de solar o de\ncajón)](/wiki/Rumba_\\(de_solar_o_de_caj%C3%B3n\\) \"Rumba \\(de solar o de\ncajón\\)\")), is an amalgamation of several African drumming and dance\ntraditions, combined with Spanish influences. According to Cuban musicologist\nArgeliers León: \"In the feast that constituted a rumba concurred, therefore,\ndetermined African contributions, but also converged other elements from\nHispanic roots, that were already incorporated to the expressions that\nappeared in the new population emerging in the Island.\"[129]\n\nRumba (de solar o de cajón) is a [secular](/wiki/Secular \"Secular\") musical\nstyle from the docks and the less prosperous areas of Havana and\n[Matanzas](/wiki/Matanzas \"Matanzas\"). A the beginning, rumba musicians used a\ntrio of wooden boxes ([cajones](/wiki/Caj%C3%B3n \"Cajón\")) to play, that were\nsubstituted at a later time by drums, similar in appearance to [conga\ndrums](/wiki/Conga_drums \"Conga drums\"). The treble drum is called \"quinto\",\nthe medium range drum is called \"macho or tres-dos\" (three-two), because its\nessential rhythm is based on the Cuban clave pattern, and the bass drum is\ncalled \"hembra o salidor,\" because it usually began or \"broke in\" (rompía) the\nrumba.[130] In the Rumba ensemble they also utilize two sticks or spoons to\nbeat over a hollow piece of bamboo called \"guagua\" or \"catá,\" as well as the\nCuban Claves, the Güiro and some rattles from bantu origin called\n\"nkembi\".[131]\n\nThe vocal part of the rumba corresponds to a modified version of the ancient\nSpanish style of \"copla-estribillo\" (quatrain-refrain), including a \"montuno\"\nsection that one may consider an expanded or developed \"refrain\" that\nconstitute an independent section which include the [call and\nresponse](/wiki/Call_and_response_\\(music\\) \"Call and response \\(music\\)\")\nstyle, so typical of the African traditions.[132]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Havana_-\n_Cuba_-_0675.jpg/300px-Havana_-_Cuba_-_0675.jpg)](/wiki/File:Havana_-\n_Cuba_-_0675.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Havana_-_Cuba_-_0675.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRumba drummers\n\nFrom the many rumba styles that began to appear during the end of the 19th\ncentury called \"Spanish times\" (Tiempo'españa), such as tahona, jiribilla,\npalatino and resedá, three basic Rumba forms have survived: the\n[Columbia](/wiki/Cuban_rumba#Columbia \"Cuban rumba\"), the\n[guaguancó](/wiki/Guaguanc%C3%B3 \"Guaguancó\") and the [yambú](/wiki/Yamb%C3%BA\n\"Yambú\"). The Columbia, played in 6/8 time, is often as a solo dance performed\nonly by a male performer. It is fast and swift and also includes aggressive\nand acrobatic moves. The [guaguancó](/wiki/Guaguanc%C3%B3 \"Guaguancó\") is\ndanced by a pair of one man and one woman. The dance simulates the man's\npursuit of the woman. The [yambú](/wiki/Yamb%C3%BA \"Yambú\"), now a relic,\nfeatured a burlesque imitation of an old man walking with a stick. All forms\nof rumba are accompanied by song or chants.[133][134]\n\nRumba (de solar o de cajón) is today a fossil genre usually seen in Cuba in\nperformances of professional groups. There are also amateur groups based on\n_Casas de Cultura_ (Culture Centers), and on work groups. Like all aspects of\nlife in Cuba, dance and music are organised by the state through Ministries\nand their various committees.[135]\n\n## Coros de\nClave[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=51 \"Edit\nsection: Coros de Clave\")]\n\nMain article: [Coros de Clave](/wiki/Coros_de_Clave \"Coros de Clave\")\n\nCoros de Clave were popular choral groups that emerged at the beginning of the\n20th century in Havana and other Cuban cities.\n\nThe Cuban government only allowed black people, slaves or free, to cultivate\ntheir cultural traditions within the boundaries of certain mutual aid\nsocieties, which were founded during the 16th century. According to David H.\nBrown, those societies, called Cabildos, \"provided in times of sickness and\ndeath, held masses for deceased members, collected funds to buy nation-\nbrethren out of slavery, held regular dances and diversions on Sundays and\nfeast days, and sponsored religious masses, processions and dancing carnival\ngroups (now called comparsas) around the annual cycle of Catholic festival\ndays.\"[136]\n\nWithin the Cabildos of certain neighborhoods from Havana,\n[Matanzas](/wiki/Matanzas \"Matanzas\"), [Sancti\nSpíritus](/wiki/Sancti_Sp%C3%ADritus \"Sancti Spíritus\") and\n[Trinidad](/wiki/Trinidad \"Trinidad\"), some choral groups were founded during\nthe 19th century that organized competitive activities, and in some occasions\nwere visited by local authorities and neighbors that gave them money and\npresents. Those choral societies were called Coros de Clave, probably after\nthe instrument that used to accompany their performances, the Cuban\n[Claves](/wiki/Claves \"Claves\").[137]\n\nThe accompaniment of the choirs also included a [guitar](/wiki/Guitar\n\"Guitar\") and the percussion was executed over the sound box of an American\nbanjo from which the strings were removed, due to the fact that African drums\nperformance was strictly forbidden in Cuban cities.[138] The style of the\nCoros de Clave music, and particulally its rhythm, originated at a later time\na popular song genre called Clave, which most probable served as the original\nprototype for the creation of the Criolla genre. Both genres, the Clave and\nthe Criolla became very popular within the Cuban vernacular theater\nrepertoire.\n\n## Rural rumba[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=52\n\"Edit section: Rural rumba\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Miguel_Arias_Bardou2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Miguel_Arias_Bardou2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Miguel_Arias_Bardou2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCuban rural landscape\n\nIn a similar way as the first Spanish song-dances spread from the cities to\nthe countryside, also the characteristics of the Cuban\n[Guaracha](/wiki/Guaracha \"Guaracha\"), that enjoyed great popularity in\nHavana, began to spread to the rural areas in an undetermined time during the\n19th century. This process was not difficult at all if one considers how close\none to the other were the urban and the rural areas in Cuba at that time. That\nwas why the Cuban peasants (guajiros) began to include in their parties called\n\"guateques\" or \"changüís\", and in feasts such as the \"fiestas patronales\"\n(patron saint celebrations) and the \"parrandas\", some Rumbitas (little rumbas)\nthat were very similar to the urban Guarachas, which binary meter contrasted\nwith the ternary beat of their traditional \"tonadas\" and \"zapateos\".[139]\n\nThose little rural rumbas have been called by renowned musicologist Danilo\nOrozco \"proto-sones\", \"soncitos primigenios\", \"rumbitas\", \"nengones\"or\n\"marchitas,\" and some of them, such as: Caringa, Papalote, Doña Joaquina, Anda\nPepe and the [Tingotalango](/wiki/Tingotalango \"Tingotalango\") have been\npreserved until the present time.[140]\n\nThe Rumbitas were considered as Proto-sones (primeval Sones), because of the\nevident analogy that its structural components show with the Son, which\nemerged in Havana during the first decades of the 20th century. The Rumbitas\nmay be considered as the original prototype of this popular genre.[141]\n\nAccording to musicologist Virtudes Feliú, those Rumbitas appeared in cities\nand towns throughout the entire territory of the Island, such as: Ciego de\nÁvila, Sancti Espíritus, Cienfuegos, Camagüey, Puerta de Golpe in Pinar del\nRío and Bejucal in Havana, as well as Remedios in Villa Clara and Isla de\nPinos (Pines Island).[142]\n\nThere are many references to the Cuban Independence Wars (1868-1898), related\nto the rural Rumbitas, in the Eastern region of the country as well as in the\nWestern region and Isla de Pinos, which suggest that their emergence took\nplace approximately during the second half of the 19th century.[143]\n\nThe rural Rumbitas included a greater number of African characteristics in\ncomparison with the Cuban Guaracha, due to the gradual integration of free\nAfro-Cuban citizens to the rural environment.[144]\n\nSince the 16th century, thanks to a government approved program called\n\"manumisión\", the black slaves were allowed to pay for their freedom with\ntheir own savings. Therefore, a larger number of free blacks were dedicated to\nthe manual labors in the fields than in the cities and some of them were also\nable to become proprietaries of land and slaves.[145]\n\n### Characteristics of the rural\nrumba[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=53 \"Edit\nsection: Characteristics of the rural rumba\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Trescubano.jpg/100px-\nTrescubano.jpg)](/wiki/File:Trescubano.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Trescubano.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTres cubano\n\nOne of the most salient characteristics of the rural Rumbitas was its own\nform, very similar to the African typical song structure. In this case, the\nentire piece was based on a single musical fragment or phrase of short\nduration that was repeated, with some variations, time and time again; often\nalternating with a choir. This style was called \"Montuno\" (literally \"from the\ncountryside\") due to its rural origin.[146]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Marimbula_player.jpg/200px-\nMarimbula_player.jpg)](/wiki/File:Marimbula_player.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Marimbula_player.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMarímbula\n\nAnother characteristic of the new genre was the superposition of different\nrhythmic patterns simultaneously executed, similarly to the way it is utilized\nin the Urban Rumba, which is also a common trait of the African musical\ntradition.[147] Those layers or \"franjas de sonoridades\" according to\nArgeliers León, were assigned to different instruments that were gradually\nincorporated to the group. Therefore, the ensemble grew from the traditional\nTiple and Güiro, to a one that included: guitar, \"bandurria\", Cuban lute,\nclaves, and other instruments such as the\"[tumbandera](/wiki/Tumbandera\n\"Tumbandera\")\", the \"[marímbula](/wiki/Mar%C3%ADmbula \"Marímbula\")\", the\n\"[botija](/wiki/Botija \"Botija\")\", the [bongoes](/wiki/Bongoes \"Bongoes\"), the\ncommon \"machete\" (cutlass) and the accordion.[148]\n\nSome important musical functions were assigned to the sonority layers, such as\nthe: \"Time Line\" or Clave Rhythm performed by the claves, a \"1-eighth note +\n2-sixteenth notes\" rhythm played by the güiro or the machete, the patterns of\nthe \"guajeo\" by the [Tres (instrument)](/wiki/Tres_\\(instrument\\) \"Tres\n\\(instrument\\)\"), the improvisation on the bongoes and the anticipated bass on\nthe \"tumbandera\" or the \"botija\".[149]\n\n## Proto-son[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=54\n\"Edit section: Proto-son\")]\n\nThe origin of the Cuban son can be traced to the rural rumbas, called proto-\nsones (primeval sones) by musicologist Danilo Orozco. They show, in a partial\nor embryonic form, all the characteristics that at a later time were going to\nidentify the Son style: The repetition of a phrase called _montuno_ , the\nclave pattern, a rhythmic counterpoint between different layers of the musical\ntexture, the _guajeo_ from the Tres, the rhythms from the guitar, the bongoes\nand the double bass and the [call and\nresponse](/wiki/Call_and_response_\\(music\\) \"Call and response \\(music\\)\")\nstyle between soloist and choir.[150] According to Radamés Giro: at a later\ntime the refrain (estribillo) or _montuno_ was tied to a quatrain (cuarteta –\ncopla) called _regina_ , which was how the peasants from the Eastern side of\nthe country called the quatrain. In this way, the structure\n_refrain–quatrain–refrain_ appears at a very early stage in the _Son\nOriental,_ like in one of the most ancient Sones called \"Son de Máquina\"\n(Machine Son) which comprises three _reginas_ with its correspondent\nrefrains.[151]\n\nDuring an investigative project about the Valera-Miranda family (old Soneros)\nconducted by Danilo Orozco in the region of Guantánamo, he recorded a sample\nof Nengón, which is considered an ancestor of the Changüí. It shows the\npreviously mentioned _refrain–quatrain–refrain_ structure. In this case, the\nseveral repetitions of the refrain constitute a true \"montuno.\"\n\nRefrain: Yo he nacido para ti nengón, yo he nacido para ti nengón, yo he\nnacido para ti Nengón… (I was born for you Nengón…)[152]\n\n### Nengón[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=55\n\"Edit section: Nengón\")]\n\nThe \"Nengón\" is considered a Proto-Son, precursor of the Changüí and also of\nthe Oriental Son. Its main characteristic is the alternance of improvised\nverses between a soloist and a choir. The Nengón is played with Tres, Guitar,\nGüiro and Tingotalango or Tumbandera.[153]\n\n### Changüí[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=56\n\"Edit section: Changüí\")]\n\nMain article: [Changüí](/wiki/Chang%C3%BC%C3%AD \"Changüí\")\n\nChangüí is a type of son from the eastern provinces (area of [Santiago de\nCuba](/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba \"Santiago de Cuba\") and\n[Guantánamo](/wiki/Guant%C3%A1namo \"Guantánamo\")), formerly known as\n[Oriente](/wiki/Oriente_Province \"Oriente Province\"). It shares relevant\ncharacteristics with the Oriental Son in regard to rhythms, instruments and\nchoral refrains; and at the same time it shows certain original elements.[154]\n\nChangüí exists today in the form of half-a-dozen small groups, mostly from\nGuantanamo.[155] The instrumentation is similar to that of the early Son\ngroups who set up in Havana before 1920. These son groups, for example, the\nearly [Sexteto\nBoloña](/w/index.php?title=Sexteto_Bolo%C3%B1a&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Sexteto\nBoloña \\(page does not exist\\)\") and [Sexteto Habanero](/wiki/Sexteto_Habanero\n\"Sexteto Habanero\"), used either marimbulas or\n[botijas](/wiki/List_of_Caribbean_aerophones \"List of Caribbean aerophones\")\nas bass instruments before they changed over to the [double\nbass](/wiki/Double_bass \"Double bass\"), musically a more flexible instrument.\n\nIt is an open question whether today Changüí is still a genuinely distinctive\nmusic, or simply an archaic form of Son artificially preserved by state\nsupport. Some modern orchestras, such as [Orquesta\nRevé](/w/index.php?title=Orquesta_Rev%C3%A9&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Orquesta\nRevé \\(page does not exist\\)\"), have claimed Changüí as their main influence.\nWhether this is accurate, or not, is unclear.\n\n### Sucu-Sucu[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=57\n\"Edit section: Sucu-Sucu\")]\n\nWe can also find in Isla de Pinos, at the opposite Western side of the Island\na primeval Proto-Son called Sucu-Sucu, which also shows the same structure of\nthe Oriental Proto-Sones. According to Maria Teresa Linares, In the Sucu-Sucu\nthe music is similar to a Son Montuno in its formal, melodic, instrumental and\nharmonic structure. A soloist alternates with a choir and improvises on a\nquatrain or a \"décima.\" The instrumental group initiates an introduction to\nwhich the instruments gradually incorporates, beginning with the Tres. The\nintroduction of eight measures is followed by the refrain by the choir that\nalternates with the soloist several times.[156]\n\n## Trova[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=58 \"Edit\nsection: Trova\")]\n\nMain article: [Trova](/wiki/Trova \"Trova\")\n\nIn the 19th century here grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant\nmusicians, troubadors, who moved around earning their living by singing and\nplaying the guitar.[157] They were of great importance as composers, and their\nsongs have been transcribed for all genres of Cuban music\n\n[Pepe Sánchez](/wiki/Pepe_S%C3%A1nchez_\\(trova\\) \"Pepe Sánchez \\(trova\\)\"),\nborn José Sánchez (1856–1918), is known as the father of the _trova_ style and\nthe creator of the Cuban bolero.[158] He had no formal training in music.

As a result, most of these numbers are now lost for ever, though\nsome two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples transcribed them.\nHis first bolero, _Tristezas_ , is still remembered today.

Garay was also musically\nilliterate – in fact, he only taught himself the [alphabet](/wiki/Alphabet\n\"Alphabet\") at 16 – but in his case not only were scores recorded by others,\nbut there are recordings. Garay settled in Havana in 1906, and in 1926 joined\nRita Montaner and others to visit Paris, spending three months there. He\nbroadcast on radio, made recordings and survived into modern times. He used to\nsay \"Not many men have shaken hands with both [José\nMartí](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD \"José Martí\") and [Fidel\nCastro](/wiki/Fidel_Castro \"Fidel Castro\")!\"[13]p298[161]\n\n[José 'Chicho' Ibáñez](/wiki/Chicho_Ib%C3%A1%C3%B1ez \"Chicho Ibáñez\")\n(1875–1981)[162] was even longer-lived than Garay.

El Guayabero ([Faustino Oramas](/wiki/Faustino_Oramas \"Faustino\nOramas\"): 1911–2007) was the last of the old trova.\n\nTrova musicians often worked in pairs and trios, some of them exclusively so\n(Compay Segundo). As the sexteto/septeto/conjunto genre grew many of them\njoined in the larger groups. And let's not forget the [Trio\nMatamoros](/wiki/Trio_Matamoros \"Trio Matamoros\"), who worked together for\nmost of their lives.

The bolero-son became for several decades the most\npopular rhythm for dancing in Cuba, and it was this rhythm that the\ninternational dance community picked up and taught as the wrongly-named\n'rumba'.\n\nThe Cuban bolero was exported all over the world, and is still popular.\nLeading composers of the bolero were [Sindo Garay](/wiki/Sindo_Garay \"Sindo\nGaray\"), [Rosendo Ruiz](/wiki/Rosendo_Ruiz \"Rosendo Ruiz\"), [Carlos\nPuebla](/wiki/Carlos_Puebla \"Carlos Puebla\"), and [Agustín\nLara](/wiki/Agust%C3%ADn_Lara \"Agustín Lara\")\n(Mexico).[158][164][165][166][167]\n\n### Canción[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=60\n\"Edit section: Canción\")]\n\nMain article: [Canción](/wiki/Canci%C3%B3n \"Canción\")\n\n_Canción_ means 'song' in Spanish. It is a popular genre of [Latin American\nmusic](/wiki/Latin_American_music \"Latin American music\"), particularly in\nCuba, where many of the compositions originate. Its roots lie in Spanish,\nFrench and Italian popular song forms. Originally highly stylized, with\n\"intricate melodies and dark, enigmatic and elaborate lyrics\"[168] The canción\nwas democratized by the trova movement in the latter part of the 19th century,\nwhen it became a vehicle for the aspirations and feelings of the population.\nCanción gradually fused with other forms of Cuban music, such as the\nbolero.[169]\n\n## Tropical\nwaltz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=61 \"Edit\nsection: Tropical waltz\")]\n\nThe [waltz](/wiki/Waltz \"Waltz\") (_El vals_) arrived in Cuba by 1814. It was\nthe first dance in which couples were not linked by a communal sequence\npattern. It was, and still is, danced in 3/4 time with the accent on the first\nbeat. It was originally thought scandalous because couples faced each other,\nheld each other in the 'closed' hold, and, so to speak, ignored the\nsurrounding community. The waltz entered all countries in the Americas; its\nrelative popularity in 19th-century Cuba is hard to estimate.\n\nIndigenous Cuban dances did not use the closed hold with couples dancing\nindependently until the danzón later in the century, though the\n[guaracha](/wiki/Guaracha \"Guaracha\") might be an earlier example. The waltz\nhas another characteristic: it is a 'travelling' dance, with couples moving\nround the arena. In Latin dances, progressive movement of dancers is unusual,\nbut does occur in the [conga](/wiki/Conga_\\(comparsa\\) \"Conga \\(comparsa\\)\"),\nthe [samba](/wiki/Samba \"Samba\") and the [tango](/wiki/Tango_\\(dance\\) \"Tango\n\\(dance\\)\").\n\nThe _Tropical waltz_ was performed in a slower tempo and frequently included a\nsung melody with a text. Those texts usually referred to the beauties of the\nCuban countryside, the longing of the Siboneyes (Cuban aboriginee) and other\ncreole themes. With accents on its three beats, its melody was fluid and\ncomposed of equal value notes. It was similar to many other songs in which the\nmelody was treated in a syllabic way, where the first beat was not stressed by\na brief anacrusis but had a tendency to move toward the second beat like in\nthe peasant (guajiro) song.[170]\n\n## Son[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=62 \"Edit\nsection: Son\")]\n\nMain article: [Son (music)](/wiki/Son_\\(music\\) \"Son \\(music\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Guitarra_y_tres.JPG/150px-\nGuitarra_y_tres.JPG)](/wiki/File:Guitarra_y_tres.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Guitarra_y_tres.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nGuitar and Tres\n\n**Son cubano** is a style of [music](/wiki/Music \"Music\") and\n[dance](/wiki/Dance_in_Cuba \"Dance in Cuba\") that originated in Cuba and\ngained worldwide popularity during the 1930s. Son combines the structure and\ntraits of the [Spanish](/wiki/Music_of_Spain \"Music of Spain\")\n[canción](/wiki/Canci%C3%B3n \"Canción\") with Afro-Cuban stylistic and\n[percussion instruments](/wiki/Percussion_instrument \"Percussion instrument\")\nelements. The Cuban Son is one of the most influential and widespread forms of\nLatin American music: its derivatives and fusions, especially\n[salsa](/wiki/Salsa_music \"Salsa music\"), have spread across the world.[171]\n\nThe Son, said Cristóbal Díaz, is the most important genre of Cuban music, and\nthe least studied.[172] It can fairly be said that son is to Cuba what the\n[tango](/wiki/Tango_music \"Tango music\") is to [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina\n\"Argentina\"), or the [samba](/wiki/Samba \"Samba\") to [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil\n\"Brazil\"). In addition, it is perhaps the most flexible of all forms of Latin-\nAmerican music. Its great strength is its fusion between European and African\nmusical traditions. Its most characteristic instruments are the Cuban\ninstrument known as the _[tres](/wiki/Tres_\\(musical_instrument\\) \"Tres\n\\(musical instrument\\)\")_ , and the well-known double-headed\n[bongó](/wiki/Bong%C3%B3 \"Bongó\"); these are present from the start to the\npresent day. Also typical are the [claves](/wiki/Claves \"Claves\"), the Spanish\n[guitar](/wiki/Guitar \"Guitar\"), the [double bass](/wiki/Double_bass \"Double\nbass\") (replacing the early [botija](/wiki/Botija \"Botija\") or\n[marímbula](/wiki/Mar%C3%ADmbula \"Marímbula\")), early on the\n[cornet](/wiki/Cornet \"Cornet\") or trumpet and finally the piano.\n\nIn spite of a traditional tendency to attribute the origin of Cuban Son to the\nEastern region of Cuba (Oriente), most recently, some musicologists have shown\na more inclusive stance. Although Alejo Carpentier, Emilio Grenet and\nCristóbal Díaz Ayala support the \"Eastern origin\" theory, Argeliers León\ndoesn't mention anything about it in his pivotal work \"Del Canto y el Tiempo\",\nas well as María Teresa Linares in \"The Music between Cuba and Spain.\"[173]\nRamadamés Giro states about this subject: \"If Son was an artistic phenomenon\nthat was developing since the second half of the 19th century – and not just\nin the old Oriente (Eastern) province -, it is logical to suppose, but not to\naffirm, that long before 1909 it was heard in the Capital City (Havana)\nbecause of the aforementioned reasons...\"[174]\n\nIt was in Havana where the encounter of the rural rumba and the urban rumba,\nthat had been developing separately during the second half of the 19th\ncentury, took place. The guaracheros and rumberos that used to play with the\nTiple and the Guiro finally met other Rumberos that sang and danced\naccompanied by the wooden box (cajón) and the Cuban Clave, and the result was\nthe fusion of both styles in a new genre called Son.[175] Around 1910 the Son\nmost likely adopted the [clave rhythm](/wiki/Clave_rhythm \"Clave rhythm\") from\nthe Havana-based [rumba](/wiki/Cuban_rumba \"Cuban rumba\"), which had been\ndeveloped in the late 19th century in Havana and [Matanzas](/wiki/Matanzas\n\"Matanzas\").[176]\n\nThe mass popularization of Son music led to an increased valorization of\n[Afro-Cuban](/wiki/Afro-Cuban \"Afro-Cuban\") street culture and of the artists\nwho created it. It also opened the door for other music genres with Afro-Cuban\nroots to become popular in Cuba and throughout the world.[177]\n\n## Cuban jazz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=63\n\"Edit section: Cuban jazz\")]\n\nThe history of jazz in Cuba was obscured for many years, but it has become\nclear that its history in Cuba is virtually as long as its history in the\nUS.[178][179][180][181][182][183]\n\nMuch more is now known about [early Cuban jazz\nbands](/wiki/Early_Cuban_bands#Early_Cuban_jazz_bands \"Early Cuban bands\"),\nbut a full assessment is plagued by the lack of recordings.

The rumbustious conguero [Chano Pozo](/wiki/Chano_Pozo \"Chano\nPozo\") was also important, for he introduced jazz musicians to basic Cuban\nrhythms. Cuban jazz has continued to be a significant influence.\n\nThe mambo first entered the United States around 1950, though ideas had been\ndeveloping in Cuba and Mexico City for some time. The mambo as understood in\nthe United States and Europe was considerably different from the danzón-mambo\nof [Orestes \"Cachao\" Lopez](/wiki/Orestes_%22Cachao%22_Lopez \"Orestes \"Cachao\"\nLopez\"), which was a danzon with extra syncopation in its final part.

About 27 of those recordings had [Benny Moré](/wiki/Benny_Mor%C3%A9\n\"Benny Moré\") as the singer, though the best sellers were mainly\ninstrumentals.

The word \"Mambo\", similarly to\nother afroamerican musical denominations as conga, milonga, bomba, tumba,\nsamba, bamba, bamboula, tambo, tango, cumbé, cumbia and candombe, denote an\nAfrican origin, particularly from Congo, due to the presence of certain\ncharacteristic combinations of sounds, such as mb, ng and nd, which belong to\nthe Niger-Congo linguistic complex.\n\nThe earliest roots of the Cuban Mambo can be traced to the \"Danzón de Nuevo\nRitmo\" (Danzón with a new rhythm) made popular by the orchestra \"Arcaño y sus\nMaravillas\" conducted by famous bandleader [Antonio\nArcaño](/wiki/Antonio_Arca%C3%B1o \"Antonio Arcaño\"). He was the first to\ndenominate a section of the popular Cuban [Danzón](/wiki/Danz%C3%B3n \"Danzón\")\nas a \"Mambo.\" It was Arcaño's cellist, [Orestes\nLópez](/wiki/Orestes_L%C3%B3pez \"Orestes López\"), who created the first Danzón\ncalled \"Mambo\" (1938).[203] In this piece, some syncopated motives, taken from\nthe [Son](/wiki/Son_\\(music\\) \"Son \\(music\\)\") style, were combined with\nimprovised flute passages.[204]\n\nPianist and arranger from Matanzas, Cuba, Dámaso Pérez Prado (1927)\nestablished his residence in Havana at the beginning of the 1940s and began to\nwork at night clubs and orchestras, such as Paulina Alvarez's and Casino de La\nPlaya. In 1949 he traveled to Mexico looking for job opportunities and\nachieved great success with a new style, to which he assigns a name that had\nbeen already utilized by Antonio Arcaño, the \"Mambo.\"[205]\n\nPerez Prado's style differed from the previous \"Mambo\" concept. The new style\npossessed a greater influence from the North-American Jazz band music, and an\nexpanded instrumentation consisting of four or five trumpets, four of five\nsaxophones, double bass, drum set, maracas, cowbell, congas and bongoes. The\nnew \"Mambo\" included a catchy counterpoint between the trumpets and the\nsaxophones, that impulsed the body to move along with the rhythm, stimulated\nat the end of each musical phrase by a characteristic deep throat sound\nexpression.[206]\n\nPrado's recordings were meant for the Latin American and U.S. Latino markets,\nbut some of his most celebrated mambos, such as \"Mambo No. 5\" and \"Que Rico el\nMambo\", quickly crossed over to the United States.[207]\n\n## Chachachá[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=72\n\"Edit section: Chachachá\")]\n\nMain article: [Cha-cha-chá (music)](/wiki/Cha-cha-ch%C3%A1_\\(music\\) \"Cha-cha-\nchá \\(music\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Cha-\nCha_dance_pattern.png/250px-Cha-Cha_dance_pattern.png)](/wiki/File:Cha-\nCha_dance_pattern.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cha-Cha_dance_pattern.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nCha-Cha [rhythm](/wiki/Rhythm \"Rhythm\").[208]\n\n**[Chachachá](/wiki/Chachach%C3%A1 \"Chachachá\")** is a genre of Cuban music.\nIt has been a popular dance music which developed from the [Danzón-\nmambo](/wiki/Danz%C3%B3n-mambo \"Danzón-mambo\") in the early 1950s, and became\nwidely popular throughout the entire world.\n\n[Chachachá](/wiki/Chachach%C3%A1 \"Chachachá\") is a Cuban music genre whose\ncreation has been traditionally attributed to Cuban composer and violinist\n[Enrique Jorrín](/wiki/Enrique_Jorr%C3%ADn \"Enrique Jorrín\"), which began his\ncareer playing for the [charanga](/wiki/Charanga_\\(Cuba\\) \"Charanga \\(Cuba\\)\")\nband [Orquesta América](/wiki/Orquesta_Am%C3%A9rica \"Orquesta América\").[209]\n\nAccording to the testimony of [Enrique Jorrín](/wiki/Enrique_Jorr%C3%ADn\n\"Enrique Jorrín\"), he composed some \"[Danzones](/wiki/Danzon \"Danzon\")\" in\nwhich the musician of the orchestra had to sing short refrains, and this style\nwas very successful. In the Danzón \"Constancia\" he introduced some\n[montunos](/wiki/Montuno \"Montuno\") and the audience was motivated to join in\nsinging the refrains. Jorrín also asked the members of the orchestra to sing\nin unison so the lyrics may be heard more clearly and achieve a greater impact\nin the audience. That way of singing also helped to mask the poor singing\nskills of the orchestra members.\n\nSince its inception, [Chachachá](/wiki/Chachach%C3%A1 \"Chachachá\") music had a\nclose relationship with the dancer's steps. The well-known name Chachachá came\ninto being with the help of the dancers at the Silver Star Club in Havana.\nWhen the dance was coupled to the rhythm of the music, it became evident that\nthe dancer's feet were making a peculiar sound as they grazed the floor on\nthree successive beats. It was like an onomatopoeia that sounded as:\nChachachá.

Because\nCuba has so many indigenous types of music there has always been a problem in\nmarketing the 'product' abroad to people who did not understand the\ndifferences between rhythms that, to a Cuban, are quite distinct. So, twice in\nthe 20th century, a kind of product label was developed to solve this problem.\nThe first occasion was in the 1930s after \"[The Peanut\nVendor](/wiki/The_Peanut_Vendor \"The Peanut Vendor\")\" became an international\nsuccess. It was called a 'rumba' even though it really had nothing to do with\ngenuine rumba: the number was obviously a [son](/wiki/Son_\\(music\\) \"Son\n\\(music\\)\") pregon. The label 'rumba' was used outside Cuba for years as a\ncatch-all for Cuban popular music.[217]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/HotelNacionalMusicians.jpg/200px-\nHotelNacionalMusicians.jpg)](/wiki/File:HotelNacionalMusicians.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HotelNacionalMusicians.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMusicians at the [Hotel Nacional](/wiki/Hotel_Nacional_de_Cuba \"Hotel Nacional\nde Cuba\"), Havana.

This music acquired the label of 'salsa'. No-one really knows how this\nhappened, but everyone recognised what a benefit it was to have a common label\nfor son, [mambo](/wiki/Mambo_\\(music\\) \"Mambo \\(music\\)\"), guaracha, guajira,\nguaguancó, etc. Cubans and non Cubans, such as [Tito Puente](/wiki/Tito_Puente\n\"Tito Puente\"), [Rubén Blades](/wiki/Rub%C3%A9n_Blades \"Rubén Blades\") and\nmany experts of the Cuban music and salsa have always said \"Salsa is just\nanother name for Cuban, music. Tito Puentes once said, now they call it Salsa,\nlater they may call it Stir Fry, but to me it will alway be Cuban Music\"; but\nover time salsa bands worked in other influences. For example, in the late\n1960s [Willie Colón](/wiki/Willie_Col%C3%B3n \"Willie Colón\") developed numbers\nthat made use of Brazilian rhythms. New York radio programmes offered\n'salsarengue' as a further combination. You look at a band of the 1940s\nplaying Cuban music and you will see the same exact instruments in Salsa\nMusic. Later still 'Salsa romantica' was the label for an especially sugary\ntype of [bolero](/wiki/Bolero \"Bolero\"). Even when, [Benny\nMoré](/wiki/Benny_Mor%C3%A9 \"Benny Moré\"), [Perez Prado](/wiki/Perez_Prado\n\"Perez Prado\") the greatest Sonero that ever existed, was singing Boleros with\na salsa cadence in the 1940s. It was not until the 1950s that Cuban music\nbecame popular for Puerto Rican bands. Plena, Bomba an other styles or music\nwere popular at the time in Puerto Rico. Many famous Puerto Rican musicians\nwent to learn the music styles of Cubans in the 1930s and 1940s, and it was\nnot until the arrival of Castro in 1959 and the Cuban music stopped its\nexportation to the world, that Puerto Ricans in New York were able to be\ngreatly noticed, but what is known as Salsa today, was brought to New York in\nthe 1920s and 1930s by [Dizzy Gillespie](/wiki/Dizzy_Gillespie \"Dizzy\nGillespie\") and [Chano Pozo](/wiki/Chano_Pozo \"Chano Pozo\"),[218][219] this\nlast one was discovered by [Dizzy Gillespie](/wiki/Dizzy_Gillespie \"Dizzy\nGillespie\") as he was one of the greatest percussionist that ever\nlived.[220][221][222]\n\nThe question of whether or not salsa is anything more than Cuban music has\nbeen argued over for more than thirty years. Initially, not much difference\ncould be seen. Later it became clear that not only was New York salsa\ndifferent from popular music in Cuba, but salsa in Venezuela, Colombia and\nother countries could also be distinguished. It also seems clear that salsa\nhas receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s. The reasons\nfor this are also much disputed.[223]\n\n### Nueva Trova[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=77\n\"Edit section: Nueva Trova\")]\n\nMain articles: [Nueva trova](/wiki/Nueva_trova \"Nueva trova\") and\n[Trova](/wiki/Trova \"Trova\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Casa_de_la_Trova_Santiago_Cuba.jpg/300px-\nCasa_de_la_Trova_Santiago_Cuba.jpg)](/wiki/File:Casa_de_la_Trova_Santiago_Cuba.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Casa_de_la_Trova_Santiago_Cuba.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA local musical house, Casa de la Trova, at [Santiago de\nCuba](/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba \"Santiago de Cuba\")\n\nParalleling [nueva canción](/wiki/Nueva_canci%C3%B3n \"Nueva canción\") in Latin\nAmerica is the Cuban [Nueva trova](/wiki/Nueva_trova \"Nueva trova\"), which\ndates from about 1967/68, after the [Cuban Revolution](/wiki/Cuban_Revolution\n\"Cuban Revolution\"). It differed from the traditional [trova](/wiki/Trova\n\"Trova\"), not because the musicians were younger, but because the content was,\nin the widest sense, political. Nueva trova is defined by its connection with\n[Castro](/wiki/Fidel_Castro \"Fidel Castro\")'s revolution, and by its lyrics,\nwhich attempt to escape the banalities of life by concentrating on socialism,\ninjustice, sexism, colonialism, racism and similar issues.[224] [Silvio\nRodríguez](/wiki/Silvio_Rodr%C3%ADguez \"Silvio Rodríguez\") and [Pablo\nMilanés](/wiki/Pablo_Milan%C3%A9s \"Pablo Milanés\") became the most important\nexponents of this style. [Carlos Puebla](/wiki/Carlos_Puebla \"Carlos Puebla\")\nand [Joseíto Fernández](/wiki/Jose%C3%ADto_Fern%C3%A1ndez \"Joseíto Fernández\")\nwere long-time old trova singers who added their weight to the new regime, but\nof the two only Puebla wrote special pro-revolution songs.\n\nNueva trova had its heyday in the 1970s, but was already declining before the\nfall of the Soviet Union. Examples of non-political styles in the nueva trova\nmovement can be found, for example, [Liuba María\nHevia](/wiki/Liuba_Mar%C3%ADa_Hevia \"Liuba María Hevia\") whose lyrics are\nfocused on more traditional subjects such as love and solitude, sharing with\nthe rest a highly poetical style. On the other side of the spectrum, [Carlos\nVarela](/wiki/Carlos_Varela_\\(singer-songwriter\\) \"Carlos Varela \\(singer-\nsongwriter\\)\") is famous in Cuba for his open criticism of some aspects of\nCastro's revolution.\n\nThe nueva trova, initially so popular, suffered both inside Cuba, perhaps from\na growing disenchantment with one-party rule, and externally, from the vivid\ncontrast with the [Buena Vista Social Club](/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club\n\"Buena Vista Social Club\") film and recordings. Audiences round the world have\nhad their eyes opened to the extraordinary charm and musical quality of the\nolder forms of Cuban music. By contrast, topical themes that seemed so\nrelevant in the 1960s and 1970s now seem dry and passé. Even\n\"[Guantanamera](/wiki/Guantanamera \"Guantanamera\")\" has been damaged by over-\nrepetition in less skilled hands. All the same, those pieces of high musical\nand lyrical quality, among which Puebla's \"[Hasta siempre,\nComandante](/wiki/Hasta_siempre \"Hasta siempre\")\" stands out, will probably\nlast as long as Cuba lasts.[225]\n\n## 1980s to the\npresent[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=78 \"Edit\nsection: 1980s to the present\")]\n\nSon remains the basis of most popular forms of modern Cuban music. Son is\nrepresented by long-standing groups like [Septeto\nNacional](/wiki/Septeto_Nacional \"Septeto Nacional\"), which was re-established\nin 1985, [Orquesta Aragón](/wiki/Orquesta_Arag%C3%B3n \"Orquesta Aragón\"),\n[Orquesta Ritmo\nOriental](/w/index.php?title=Orquesta_Ritmo_Oriental&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Orquesta Ritmo Oriental \\(page does not exist\\)\") and [Orquesta Original de\nManzanillo](/w/index.php?title=Orquesta_Original_de_Manzanillo&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Orquesta Original de Manzanillo \\(page does not exist\\)\"). [Sierra\nMaestra](/wiki/Sierra_Maestra \"Sierra Maestra\"), is famous for having sparked\na revival in traditional son in the 1980s. [Nueva trova](/wiki/Nueva_trova\n\"Nueva trova\") still has influence, but the overtly political themes of the\n1960s are well out of fashion. Meanwhile, [Irakere](/wiki/Irakere \"Irakere\")\nfused traditional Cuban music with [jazz](/wiki/Jazz \"Jazz\"), and groups like\n[NG La Banda](/wiki/NG_La_Banda \"NG La Banda\"),\n[Orishas](/wiki/Orishas_\\(band\\) \"Orishas \\(band\\)\") and [Son\n14](/w/index.php?title=Son_14&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Son 14 \\(page does not\nexist\\)\") continued to add new elements to son, especially [hip\nhop](/wiki/Hip_hop_music \"Hip hop music\") and [funk](/wiki/Funk \"Funk\"), to\nform [timba](/wiki/Timba \"Timba\") music; this process was aided by the\nacquisition of imported electronic equipment. There are still many\npractitioners of traditional _son montuno_ , such as [Eliades\nOchoa](/wiki/Eliades_Ochoa \"Eliades Ochoa\"), who have recorded and toured\nwidely as a result of interest in the _son montuno_ after the Buena Vista\nSocial Club success. Europe-based Cuban female singer-songwriter [Addys\nMercedes](/wiki/Addys_Mercedes \"Addys Mercedes\") merged her roots of Son and\nFilin with elements of urban, rock and pop-music, reaching mainstream airplay\ncharts in Germany.[226]****\n\nIn the 1990s, increased interest in [world music](/wiki/World_music \"World\nmusic\") coincided with the post-Soviet Union _periodo especial_ in Cuba,\nduring which the economy began opening up to tourism.

Since the early 1990s Timba has\nbeen used to describe popular dance music in Cuba, rivaled only lately by\nReggaetón. Though derived from the same roots as salsa, Timba has its own\ncharacteristics, and is intimately tied to the life and culture of Cuba, and\nespecially Havana.\n\nAs opposed to salsa, whose roots are strictly from [Son](/wiki/Son_\\(music\\)\n\"Son \\(music\\)\") and the Cuban _[conjunto](/wiki/Conjunto \"Conjunto\")_ bands\nof the 1940s and 1950s, Timba represents a synthesis of many folkloric\n([rumba](/wiki/Cuban_rumba \"Cuban rumba\"), [guaguancó](/wiki/Guaguanc%C3%B3\n\"Guaguancó\"), batá drumming and the sacred songs of\n[santería](/wiki/Santer%C3%ADa \"Santería\").[227]), and popular sources (even\ntaking inspiration from non Afro Cuban musical genres such as\n[rock](/wiki/Rock_music \"Rock music\"), [jazz](/wiki/Jazz \"Jazz\") and\n[funk](/wiki/Funk \"Funk\")). According to [Vincenzo\nPerna](/w/index.php?title=Vincenzo_Perna&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Vincenzo Perna\n\\(page does not exist\\)\"), author of _Timba: The Sound of the Cuban Crisis_ ,\ntimba needs to be spoken of because of its musical, cultural, social, and\npolitical reasons; its sheer popularity in Cuba, its novelty and originality\nas a musical style, the skill of its practitioners, its relationship with both\nlocal traditions and the culture of the black Diaspora, its meanings, and the\nway its style brings to light the tension points within society.[228] In\naddition to [timbales](/wiki/Timbales \"Timbales\"), timba drummers make use of\nthe drum-set, further distinguishing the sound from that of mainland salsa.\nThe use of synthesised keyboard is also common. Timba songs tend to sound more\ninnovative, experimental and frequently more virtuosic than salsa pieces; horn\nparts are usually fast, at times even [bebop](/wiki/Bebop \"Bebop\") influenced,\nand stretch to the extreme ranges of all instruments. Bass and percussion\npatterns are similarly unconventional.

In\nthe end, the African musicians could not make it to Havana, so the project\nbecame a 100% Cuban affair featuring veteran Cuban musicians such as [Rubén\nGonzález](/wiki/Rub%C3%A9n_Gonz%C3%A1lez_\\(pianist\\) \"Rubén González\n\\(pianist\\)\"), [Ibrahim Ferrer](/wiki/Ibrahim_Ferrer \"Ibrahim Ferrer\"),\n[Compay Segundo](/wiki/Compay_Segundo \"Compay Segundo\") and [Omara\nPortuondo](/wiki/Omara_Portuondo \"Omara Portuondo\").

In\nsubsequent years, dozens of singers and _conjuntos_ made recordings for\nforeign labels and toured internationally.\n\nThe conclusion some have drawn is that the wholesale closure of popular music\nvenues (after the revolution), which threw many musicians out of work, and\nsubsequent control by state committees, damaged the development of Cuban\npopular music.[178][214]\n\n### Hip hop[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=81\n\"Edit section: Hip hop\")]\n\n[Hip hop](/wiki/Hip_hop_music \"Hip hop music\") grew steadily more popular in\nCuba in the 1980s and 1990s through Cuba's [Special\nPeriod](/wiki/Special_Period \"Special Period\").[229] After the collapse of the\nSoviet Union, the Cuban economy went into decline. Poverty became more\nwidespread and visible in Cuba. In the 1990s, some Cubans started to protest\nthis situation by means of rap and hip-hop. During this period of economic\ncrisis, which the country's poor and black populations especially hard, hip\nhop became a way for the country's Afro-descended population to embrace their\nblackness and articulate a demand for racial equality for black people in\nCuba.[230] The idea of blackness and black liberation was not always\ncompatible with the goals of the Cuban government, which was still operating\nunder the idea that a raceless society was the correct realization of the\nCuban Revolution. When hip-hop emerged, the Cuban government opposed the\nvulgar image that rappers portrayed, but later accepted that it might be\nbetter to have hip-hop under the influence of the Ministry of Culture as an\nauthentic expression of Cuban Culture.[231] Rap music in Cuba is heavily\ninfluenced by the country's pre-existing musical traditions, such as salsa and\nrumba.[231]\n\nIn some ways, hip hop is tolerated by the government of Cuba and performers\nare provided with venues and equipment by the government.[232] The Cuban rap\nand hip-hop scene sought out the involvement of the Ministry of Culture in the\nproduction and promotion of their music, which would otherwise have been\nimpossible to accomplish.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] After the Cuban government provided lukewarm\nendorsement, the [Cuban Rap Agency](/wiki/Cuban_Rap_Agency \"Cuban Rap Agency\")\nprovided the Cuban rap scene, in 2002, with a state-sponsored record label,\nmagazine, and Cuba's own hip-hop festival.[231]\n\nThe government gives rap and hip-hop groups time on mass media outlets in\nreturn for hip-hop artists limiting self-expression and presenting the\ngovernment in a positive way.[233] Rappers who explicitly speak about race or\nracism in Cuba are still under scrutiny by the government.[234] The government\nrecognizes that hip-hop is growing in Cuba, and would be difficult to\neliminate.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Cubatón[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=82\n\"Edit section: Cubatón\")]\n\nMain article: [Cubatón](/wiki/Cubat%C3%B3n \"Cubatón\")\n\nLike [Spanish reggae](/wiki/Spanish_reggae \"Spanish reggae\") from\n[Panama](/wiki/Panama \"Panama\") is a new genre for the Cubans but by 2012 was\nso massively popular that \"the face of Cuban pop music\" was considered to be\nCuban reggae ([cubatón](/wiki/Cubat%C3%B3n \"Cubatón\")) singer, [Osmani\nGarcía](/wiki/Osmani_Garc%C3%ADa \"Osmani García\") \"La Voz\".[235] The advent of\nweb software helped to distribute music unofficially.

Already in the\n18th century, during the Spanish rule of Louisiana (1763–1803), the Havanese\norchestras and bands offered concerts in New Orleans and in the 19th century\nthe Cuan contradanza was very popular in the US. At the beginning of the 20th\ncentury, the first jazz bands were created in Cuba, in the style of the\nAmerican groups. The \"Sagua\" Jaz Band was founded in [Sagua la\nGrande](/wiki/Sagua_la_Grande \"Sagua la Grande\") in 1914 by Pedro Stacholy\n(conductor and pianist). The group played during 14 years at the \"Teatro\nPrincipal de Sagua _.[184]_\n\nThe strong influenece of the American music on the Cuban younger generations\ngave way to the beginning of the soloists and groups of **[Rock and\nroll](/wiki/Rock_and_roll \"Rock and roll\") in Cuba** during the 1950s. Many\nCuban artists sang versions of American songs translated to Spanish, as it was\nalso happening in Mexico.[237]\n\nThe launching of the group Los LLopis represented the entrance in a new stage\nfor the Cuban music, that of the generation and amplification of the sound by\nelectroacoustic devices; because in the sound composition of this group one\ncan observe a novel element of great importance, the inclusion of an electric\nguitar.[238]\n\nIn 1961 other artists emerged such as Dany Puga, called the King of Twist, and\nbands such as Los Satélites, Los Diablos Melódicos and Los Enfermos del Rock,\nas well as Los Halcones and Los Huracanes from Marianao.\n\nThe vocal quartet Los Zafiros was another successful group from the beginning\nof the sixties. Founded in 1961, it was influenced by the Doo-Wop style of The\nPlatters, The Diamonds and other American groups, and counted on a repertoire\nconsisting of ballads, calypsos and bossanovas, as well as songs with a slow\nrock ad bolero rhythms.\n\nAt that time, the popular group Los Astros, led by the singer and guitarist\nRaúl Gómez, was threatened by pressures exerted by the Fidel Castro regime\nover the rock groups, which were considered as a form of \"ideological\ndiversionism\" and actively opposed in all its manifesations. Its style,\nstrongly influenced by the Brithish Invasion groups, as The Beatles and The\nRolling Stones, was labelled as \"deviant\" and consequently repressed without\nany hesitation. Since then, the Revolutionary government of Cuba began to\nimplement an absolute control over all aspects of the Cuban society,\nincluding, of course, all cultural expressions.\n\nAround 1965, the Revolutionary government implemented a strategy to substitute\nthe foreign products that the young people preferred, with others that better\nmatched their official guidelines; and as a result of this strategy, a new\nradio program called Nocturno was broadcast in 1966, which initial musical\ntheme was \"La chica de la valija\" (Girl with a suitcase) from the Italian sax\nplayer Fausto Papetti. The program presented modern songs, giving priority to\nthe European repertoire in Spanish language of soloists and groups such as:\nLos Mustang, Los Bravos, Los Brincos, Juan y Junior, Rita Pavone, Massiel,\nNino Bravo, Leonardo Fabio, Salvatore Adamo and Raphael, and some Cuban groups\nas Los Zafiros and Los Dan.[239] The ban against rock music was lifted in\n1966, but rock fans continued to be marginalized by the communist\nestablishment, and watched over with suspicion as \"counter-\nrevolutionaries\".[240]\n\nActually, rock music began to be heard in Havana during the seventies, in a\nradio program from Radio Marianao called Buenas Tardes Juventud. That program\npresented groups such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Dave Clark Five, The\nAnimals, Grand Funk, Rare Earth, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley,\nNeil Sedaka and Paul Anka. At the beginning of the eighties, that radio\nstation joined Radio Ciudad de La Habana.[241]\n\nIn 1979, a three-day music festival called [Havana Jam\n'79](/wiki/Havana_Jam_%2779 \"Havana Jam '79\") took place at the [Karl Marx\nTheater](/wiki/Karl_Marx_Theater \"Karl Marx Theater\"), in [Havana,\nCuba](/wiki/Havana,_Cuba \"Havana, Cuba\"), where a group of rock artists that\nincluded [Billy Joel](/wiki/Billy_Joel \"Billy Joel\") and [Stephen\nStills](/wiki/Stephen_Stills \"Stephen Stills\") performed.\n\nIn the 1980s, a [heavy metal](/wiki/Heavy_metal_music \"Heavy metal music\")\nband called Venus was formed by Roberto Armada in Municipio Playa. They\nachieved much success and created a [headbanger](/wiki/Headbanger\n\"Headbanger\") following among the Cuban youth. [Punk rock](/wiki/Punk_rock\n\"Punk rock\") was introduced in Cuba in the late 1980s and gained a cult-type\nfollowing among a minority of the youth.\n\nDuring the nineties, rock and roll in Cuba was still an underground\nphenomenon. In Havana, the \"Ciudad de La Habana\" radio station presented\nseveral programs showing the most recent tendencies on that type of music\naround the world. Juan Camacho, an old musician and radio host had a morning\nprogram called _Disco Ciudad_. _El programa de Ramón_ was also a successful\nradio show. Some bands from that period were Gens, Zeus and Los Tarsons.\n\nIn 2001, the Welsh group [Manic Street Preachers](/wiki/Manic_Street_Preachers\n\"Manic Street Preachers\") was invited to perform in Cuba,[242] and Fidel\ncastro attended its concert along with other government authorities. In 2004,\nCastro gave a speech honoring the Birthday of [John Lennon](/wiki/John_Lennon\n\"John Lennon\"), whose music, as a member of The Beatles and as a soloist, was\nbanned in Cuba for a very long time. A bronze statue of Lennon was placed in a\nHavanese well known park, and it became a notoriety because of becoming a\nvictim of constant vandalism from passers by that frequently stole its bronze\nspectacles.\n\nAt the same time that the government was showing a more indulgent attitude\ntoward the foreign rock groups, as part of an international campaign which\npurpose was to achieve an opening in the commercial transactions and\ninvestments of the US and Europe in Cuba, it continued to implement an\ninflexible repression against any form of internal dissidence. This was the\ncase of the rocker Gorki Águila and his group Porno para Ricardo. In August\n2008, Águila was arrested under charges of [dangerousness](/wiki/Dangerousness\n\"Dangerousness\"), a law that allows the authorities to detain people whom they\nthink are likely to commit crimes, even when they have not yet committed\nthem.[243]\n\nMore recently, [Rick Wakeman](/wiki/Rick_Wakeman \"Rick Wakeman\"),\n[Sepultura](/wiki/Sepultura \"Sepultura\") and [Audioslave](/wiki/Audioslave\n\"Audioslave\") performed in Havana,[244] and The Rolling Stones offered a\nhistoric concert that has become the most outstanding rock event since the\nbeginning of the Revolutionary period in 1959.[245]\n\nA new phenomenon occurred in 2013 when several Cuban metal bands begin to\nemigrate to the United States, creating a parallel scene with the bands\nAgonizer, Escape, Ancestor, Hipnosis, Suffering Tool and Chlover [246]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Cuba&action=edit&section=84\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Orovio, H. _Cuban Music from A to Z_.
