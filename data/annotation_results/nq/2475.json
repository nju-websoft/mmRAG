Nearly all of the mortgage loans the company\nproduces in this segment are sold into the [secondary\nmarket](/wiki/Secondary_market \"Secondary market\"), mainly in the form of\nmortgage-backed securities. In 2006, 45% of those mortgages were conventional\n[non-conforming loans](/wiki/Non-conforming_loan \"Non-conforming loan\"), loans\ntoo large to sell to [Fannie Mae](/wiki/Fannie_Mae \"Fannie Mae\").[5] The\ncompany generally performs the ongoing servicing functions related to the\nmortgage loans that it produces.

Loan Production\nproduces mortgage loans through four divisions of Countrywide Home Loans:\nConsumer Markets, Full Spectrum Lending, Wholesale Lending and Correspondent\nLending.\n\nConsumer Markets and Full Spectrum Lending offer loans directly to consumers.\nLoans produced by these two retail division are originated, funded, and sold\nby Countrywide. Consumer Markets offers a wide variety of products, whereas\nFull Spectrum Lending focuses primarily on products appropriate for customers\nwith less than prime-quality credit.\n\nWholesale Lending offers loans to consumers whose loans are originated by\nanother mortgage broker. These loans are funded and sold by Countrywide, but\noriginated by other lenders.\n\nCorrespondent Lending purchases mortgage loans from other lenders, which\ninclude mortgage bankers, commercial banks, savings and loan associations,\nhome builders and credit unions. These loans may be sold by Countrywide to\nend-investors on the secondary market, but are originated and funded by other\nlenders.\n\n#### Loan\nservicing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Loan servicing\")]\n\nLoan servicing services loans, i.e., collects payments from the borrower,\nhandles escrow accounts, tax and/or insurance payments (if applicable), then\nremits \"advances\" to the investor's trustee as specified in the Pooling and\nServicing Agreement (PSA).\n\n[Loan servicing](/wiki/Loan_servicing \"Loan servicing\") typically retains a\nfraction of the payment made (typically 25 – 75 basis points of the unpaid\nprincipal balance) as a \"servicing fee\".\n\nLoan servicing also generates income in the form of interest on monies\nreceived and held prior to paying scheduled advances to the trustee, fees\ncharged for late payments, force-placed insurance, document requests, legal\nfees, payoff statements, etc.\n\n#### Loan closing\nservices[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Loan closing services\")]\n\nLandSafe and its subsidiaries offer loan closing services, including [real\nestate appraisal](/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal \"Real estate appraisal\")\nservices, automated credit reporting products, flood determination services\nand residential [title](/wiki/Title_\\(property\\) \"Title \\(property\\)\")\nservices for the six major counties of Southern California.\n\n###\nBanking[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Banking\")]\n\nThe Banking segment consisted of Countrywide Bank,\n[FSB](/wiki/Federal_Savings_Bank \"Federal Savings Bank\") and Countrywide\nWarehouse Lending. Formerly, the bank was known as Countrywide Bank, N.A., a\nnationally chartered bank that was regulated jointly by the [Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency](/wiki/Office_of_the_Comptroller_of_the_Currency\n\"Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\") and the [Federal\nReserve](/wiki/Federal_Reserve \"Federal Reserve\"), but it converted its\ncharter to a federally chartered thrift that is regulated by the [Office of\nThrift Supervision](/wiki/Office_of_Thrift_Supervision \"Office of Thrift\nSupervision\").[7][8] Countrywide Bank is the 3rd largest Savings and Loan\ninstitution and is the fastest growing bank in United States history. Assets\nfrom deposits are currently approaching $125 billion.\n\nCountrywide Bank primarily originates and purchases mortgage loans and home\nequity lines of credit for investment purposes. The majority of these loans\nare sourced through its mortgage banking subsidiary, Countrywide Home Loans.\nThe Bank obtains retail deposits, primarily [certificates of\ndeposit](/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit \"Certificate of deposit\"), through the\nInternet, call centers and more than 200 financial centers, many of which were\nlocated in Countrywide Home Loans' retail branch offices as of April 1, 2007.\n\nCountrywide Warehouse Lending provides warehouse lines of credit to mortgage\nbankers, who use these funds to originate loans. These mortgage bankers are\nprimarily customers of Countrywide Home Loans' Correspondent Lending division\nand the Capital Markets divisions; the mortgage bankers use warehouse lines of\ncredit from Countrywide Warehouse Lending to help originate loans, then sell\nthose loans to Countrywide through Correspondent Lending or Capital Markets.\n\n### Capital\nmarkets[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Capital markets\")]\n\nThe Capital Markets segment primarily operates as a registered securities\nbroker dealer, a residential mortgage loan manager and a [commercial\nmortgage](/wiki/Commercial_mortgage \"Commercial mortgage\") loan originator.\nCFC also operates broker dealers in Japan and the United Kingdom, an\nintroducing broker dealer of futures contracts, an asset manager and a broker\nof mortgage servicing rights. With the exception of its commercial mortgage\nactivities, the company transacts only with [institutional\ncustomers](/wiki/Institutional_customers \"Institutional customers\"), such as\nbanks, other depository institutions, insurance companies, asset managers,\nmutual funds, pension plans, other broker dealers and governmental agencies.\nCustomers of its commercial real estate finance business are the owners or\nsponsors of commercial properties, who can be individuals or institutions.\n\nCountrywide Asset Management Corporation manages the acquisition and\ndisposition of loans from third parties, as well as loans originated by\nCountrywide Home Loans, on behalf of Countrywide Home Loans. These are\ntypically delinquent or otherwise illiquid residential mortgage loans, which\nhave primarily been originated under [Federal Housing Administration\n(FHA)](/wiki/Federal_Housing_Administration \"Federal Housing Administration\")\nand [Veterans Administration\n(VA)](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs \"United States\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\") programs. The Company attempts to\nrehabilitate the loans, using the servicing operations of Countrywide Home\nLoans, with the intent to securitize those loans that become eligible for\nsecuritization. The remaining loans are serviced through foreclosure and\nliquidation, which includes the collection of government insurance and\nguarantee proceeds relating to defaulted FHA and VA program loans.\n\n[Securities trading](/wiki/Securities_trading \"Securities trading\") activities\ninclude the trading of debt securities in the secondary market after the\noriginal issuance of the security. [Underwriting](/wiki/Underwriting\n\"Underwriting\") activities encompass the assumption of the risk of buying a\nnew issue of securities from the issuer and reselling the securities to\ninvestors, either directly or through dealers.

Activities included Loan\nProcessing and Subservicing, providing mortgage loan application processing\nand mortgage loan subservicing in the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Woolwich by Barclays plc, this relationship\ndeveloped further, with GHL acquiring the Barclays mortgage portfolio, through\na transfer of ownership of the Barclays mortgage operation in Leeds to GHL in\n2003.\n\nBy 2005, GHL operation processed more than £11.3 billion ($20.3 billion) in\nloans, all of which are subserviced for [Barclays](/wiki/Barclays_plc\n\"Barclays plc\"), [PLC](/wiki/Public_limited_company \"Public limited company\"),\nthe joint venture partner. As of December 31, 2005, Global's subservicing\nportfolio was £59 billion ($102 billion).\n\nIn November 2005, Barclays announced that it intended to terminate the third\nparty administration arrangement with GHL and bring the mortgage originations\nand servicing operations back in-house. This resulted in Countrywide buying\nout Barclays' remaining 30% stake in GHL. Barclays brought the operation back\nin-house in February 2006.\n\nSince then Global's presence in the UK has been confined to providing support\nto Barclays and Prudential Assurance, who continue to use the proprietary\noriginations, servicing and arrears processing systems developed for GHL and\nCountrywide by Countrywide Technology Group (CWTG).\n\nA second venture in the UK, Valuation Services, provided one of the first\nelectronic residential property valuation services to third parties in the\nUnited Kingdom through a majority-owned joint venture. This was sold to First\nAmerican in 2007.\n\nOffshore Services commenced operations in India in 2004. Set up to exploit the\nstrategic advantage of employing systems specialists based in the sub-\ncontinent, it provides business process and technology services to the Parent\nCompany and its subsidiaries in both the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n##\nControversies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Controversies\")]\n\n### Employee and contract labor\nissues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Employee and contract labor issues\")]\n\nIn 2003, Countrywide was the subject of a class-action lawsuit alleging\novertime violations. Countrywide was charged with working employees 10–15\nhours per day, 6 to 7 days per week without compensating them for overtime\nwages. The lawsuit was settled in May 2005, with the payment of $30 million in\ncompensation to 400 account executives.[9] Additionally, Countrywide is one of\nmany companies that conducts in-depth background searches of new employee\napplicants. The background search goes beyond typical employment, education,\nand criminal history searches, and enables a company to view the applicant's\ncredit, and public record documents such as lawsuits and divorce records.\nAlthough it must be authorized by the applicant, Countrywide explicitly does\nnot consider applicants who deny authorization for a search. This policy has\nled to otherwise qualified applicant complaints and dispute filings which\nclaim this policy is discriminatory, invasive, and compromises the applicant's\nprivacy.\n\nCountrywide maintains a policy of not filing the legally required [Internal\nRevenue Service](/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service \"Internal Revenue Service\")\n[Form 1099](/wiki/Form_1099 \"Form 1099\") to independent brokers.[5] The\nvalidity of this is questionable however.\n\n### Minority and subprime\nborrowers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Minority and subprime borrowers\")]\n\nCountrywide agreed to a settlement with New York state attorney general [Eliot\nSpitzer](/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer \"Eliot Spitzer\") to compensate black and Hispanic\nborrowers improperly steered by Countrywide salespeople to higher-cost loans.\nThe company also agreed to improve training and oversight of its loan officers\nand to pay New York state $200,000 to cover costs of the investigation.[10]\n\nCountrywide subprime documents show a policy of lending to families with as\nlittle as $1000 of disposable income, often compromising their ability to pay\nliving expenses.\n\nEconomist [Stan\nLiebowitz](/w/index.php?title=Stan_Liebowitz&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Stan\nLiebowitz \\(page does not exist\\)\") writes that the Fannie Mae Foundation\nsingled out Countrywide Financial as a \"paragon\" of a nondiscriminatory lender\nwho works with community activists, following \"the most flexible underwriting\ncriteria permitted.\" The chief executive of Countrywide is said to have\nbragged that in order to approve minority applications, \"lenders have had to\nstretch the rules a bit.\" Countrywide's commitment to low-income loans had\ngrown to $600 billion by early 2003.[11]\n\n### Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav and Rita\ncomplaints[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav and Rita complaints\")]\n\nSome customers have complained that after the devastating hurricanes\n[Katrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina \"Hurricane Katrina\"),\n[Gustav](/wiki/Hurricane_Gustav \"Hurricane Gustav\") and\n[Rita](/wiki/Hurricane_Rita \"Hurricane Rita\"), Countrywide told loan customers\nin the affected areas that they could take a break on payments without any\nlate fees, and the payments would be added back to the end of the loan.

Alt-A mortgages (loans given to apparently creditworthy borrowers\nwithout much or any documentation) completely stopped at ratings lower than\nAAA. Difficulties extended to much of AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities.\nOnly securities with conforming mortgages were trading. Countrywide Financial\nissued a statement that its mortgage business has access to a nearly $50\nbillion funding cushion.[25]\n\nAfter the collapse of [American Home Mortgage](/wiki/American_Home_Mortgage\n\"American Home Mortgage\") on August 6 2007, attention returned to Countrywide\nFinancial which at the time had issued about 17% of all mortgages in the\nUnited States. Only days later, Countrywide Financial disclosed to the [U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange\nCommission](/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission \"U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission\") (SEC) that these disruptions in the secondary mortgage\nmarkets could hurt it financially:\n\n> Since the company is highly dependent on the availability of credit to\n> finance its operations, disruptions in the debt markets or a reduction in\n> our credit ratings could have an adverse impact on our earnings and\n> financial condition, particularly in the short term… Current conditions in\n> the debt markets include reduced liquidity and increased credit risk\n> premiums for certain market participants. These conditions, which increase\n> the cost and reduce the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the\n> future…. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be\n> successful in these efforts, that such facilities will be adequate or that\n> the cost of debt will allow us to operate at profitable levels.\n\nThis raised speculation that Countrywide was a potential bankruptcy\nrisk.[26][27] On August 10, a run on the bank began as the secondary mortgage\nmarket shut down, curtailing new mortgage funding.[28]\n\nThe perceived risk of Countrywide bonds rose. Fitch, Moody's and [Standard &\nPoor's](/wiki/Standard_%26_Poor%27s \"Standard & Poor's\") credit ratings\nagencies downgraded Countrywide 1 or 2 grades, some to near _junk_ status. The\ncost of insuring its bonds rose 22% overnight. This also limited its access to\n[commercial paper](/wiki/Commercial_paper \"Commercial paper\"). Some\ninstitutional investors admitted trying to sell Countrywide paper.[29] Fifty\nother mortgage lenders had already filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and\nCountrywide Financial was cited as a possible bankruptcy risk by Merrill Lynch\nand others on August 15. This combined with news that its ability to issue new\ncommercial paper might be severely hampered put severe pressure on the stock.\nIts shares fell $3.17 to $21.29, which was its biggest fall in a single day\nsince the crash of 1987 – the shares had fallen 50% so far that year.[30] On\nAugust 15, 2007, Merrill Lynch advised its clients to sell their stock in\nCountrywide.\n\n### Announcement of problems and\nbailouts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Announcement of problems and bailouts\")]\n\nOn Thursday, August 16, 2007, the company expressed concerns over liquidity\nbecause of the decline of the secondary market for securitized mortgage\nobligations. Countrywide also announced its intent to draw on the entire $11.5\nbillion credit line from a group of 40 banks including [JPMorgan\nChase](/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase \"JPMorgan Chase\").[31] On Friday August 17, many\ndepositors sought to withdraw their bank accounts.[32] Countrywide also\nplanned to make 90% of its loans conforming.[33] By this point stock shares\nhad lost about 75% of their peak value and speculation of bankruptcy\nbroadened.[34][35][36] At the same time the [Federal Reserve\nBank](/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank \"Federal Reserve Bank\") lowered the discount\nrate 0.5% in a last-minute, early morning conference call. The Fed accepted\nabout $17.2 billion in [repurchase agreements](/wiki/Repurchase_agreement\n\"Repurchase agreement\") for mortgage backed securities to aid in liquidity.\nThis also helped calm the stock market and investors promptly responded\npositively with the Dow posting gains.[37]\n\nAdditionally, the firm was forced to restate income it had claimed from\naccrued but unpaid interest on \"exotic\" mortgages where the initial pay rate\nwas less than the amortization rate. In 2007 it became apparent much of this\ninterest had become uncollectable.[38]\n\nIn a letter dated August 20, Federal Reserve agreed to waive banking\nregulations at the request of Citigroup and Bank of America. The Fed agreed to\nexempt both banks from rules that limited the amount that federally insured\nbanks can lend to related brokerage companies to 10% of bank capital.[39]\nUntil then, banking regulation was that banks with federally insured deposits\nshould not be put at risk by brokerage subsidiaries' activities.[40] On August\n23, Citibank and Bank of America said that they and two other banks accessed\n$500 million in 30-day financing at the Fed's [discount\nwindow](/wiki/Discount_window \"Discount window\"). The same day, Countrywide\nFinancial obtained $2 billion of new capital from Bank of America Corp. For\nthis the Bank of America brokerage arm would get convertible preferred\nstock.[41][42]\n\nOn November 26, 2007, Countrywide stock was hammered on the NYSE, dropping\nover 10% to a level of $8.64/share; less than half the share's value in August\nwhen the firm faced bankruptcy rumors and a fraction of its value in 2006.[43]\nOne proximate cause were reports that the Atlanta [Federal Home Loan\nBank](/wiki/Federal_Home_Loan_Bank \"Federal Home Loan Bank\") had extended a\nlarge amount of its credit to Countrywide to offset its inability to raise\nfunds in the private market. Senator [Chuck Schumer](/wiki/Chuck_Schumer\n\"Chuck Schumer\") called for an investigation as to the prudence of the FHLBB's\naction in this regard.[44]\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, [Angelo R. Mozilo](/wiki/Angelo_Mozilo \"Angelo Mozilo\")\nsold much of his CFC stock realizing $291.5 million in profits.[5][45] A class\naction suit was filed on behalf of shareholders alleging securities\nviolations.\n\nIn September 2008, Countrywide sent letters to its mortgage customers to\ninform that one of their employees had stolen identity information that\ncontained social security numbers and birth dates. Countrywide apologized in\nthe letter and offered free credit monitoring for 90 days.\n\n### 'Protect Our House' PR\ncampaign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: 'Protect Our House' PR campaign\")]\n\nIn September 2007, after months of negative publicity and the announcement of\na reduction of 20% of its workforce,[46] Countrywide launched a public\nrelations campaign aimed at demoralized employees. Employees were expected to\nsign a pledge to \"demonstrate their commitment to our efforts\" and \"to tell\nthe Countrywide story to all\". Those who signed the pledge received a green\nrubber Protect Our House wristband.[47]\n\n###\nTakeover[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Takeover\")]\n\nThe endgame in [Bank of America](/wiki/Bank_of_America \"Bank of America\")'s $4\nbillion takeover of Countrywide Financial began with a December phone call\nfrom Countrywide Chief Executive [Angelo Mozilo](/wiki/Angelo_Mozilo \"Angelo\nMozilo\") to his Bank of America counterpart, Kenneth D. Lewis. And on January\n11, 2008, [Bank of America](/wiki/Bank_of_America \"Bank of America\") announced\nit had agreed to buy Countrywide for $4 billion in an all-stock\ntransaction.[48] The stock's value settled at about $5½ per share following\nthe announcement; it had been as low as $4.43 before the Bank of America deal\nwas announced.[49]\n\nAfter more than six months of financial deterioration at Countrywide—despite a\n$2 billion infusion of cash from Bank of America in August—Mozilo said he was\nready to throw in the towel, according to Lewis.\n\nAt the same time, having watched Countrywide dramatically retool its\noperations in a bid to survive, Bank of America executives began to believe\nCountrywide's big U.S. mortgage business might be worth having.\n\n> The ability to get that kind of size and scale became more appealing as we\n> saw the business model change to a model we could accept,\" Lewis said. \"We\n> considered the lawsuits, the negative publicity that Countrywide had. We\n> weighed the short-term pain versus what we think will be a very good deal\n> for our shareholders.\n\nBank of America deployed 60 analysts from its headquarters in Charlotte, N.C.,\nto Countrywide's headquarters in Calabasas, Calif. After four weeks analyzing\nCountrywide's legal and financial predicament, and modeling how its loan\nportfolio was likely to perform, Bank of America offered an all-stock deal\nvalued at $4 billion for Countrywide—a fraction of the company's $24 billion\nmarket value a year ago.[50] Countrywide [shareholders](/wiki/Shareholders\n\"Shareholders\") approved the deal on June 25, 2008[51] and it closed July 2,\n2008.[52] Bank of America announced on June 26, 2008 that the takeover of\nCountrywide Financial Corp. will result in the loss of 7,500 jobs over the\nnext two years.[53]\n\nThe deal was a landmark in the housing crisis, given Countrywide's prominence\nas the nation's largest mortgage lender, at the time.[54] It was to prove more\ncostly to Bank of America, however, than was perceived at the time: in August\n2014, B of A was forced to agree to a near-$17 billion deal to settle claims\nagainst it relating to the sale of toxic mortgage-linked securities, a large\npercentage of which had been sold by Countrywide.[55]\n\n### SEC\ncharges[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: SEC charges\")]\n\nOn June 4, 2009, the [U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission](/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission \"U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission\") charged former CEO [Angelo Mozilo](/wiki/Angelo_Mozilo\n\"Angelo Mozilo\") with [insider trading](/wiki/Insider_trading \"Insider\ntrading\") and [securities fraud](/wiki/Securities_fraud \"Securities fraud\"),\nand former COO David Sambol and former CFO Eric Sieracki with securities fraud\nfor failing to disclose Countrywide's lax lending standards in Countrywide's\n2006 annual report.[56][57] Despite these charges, Countrywide, and then its\nsuccessor Bank of America, were awarded the Property Management contract with\nthe Veterans Administration. A July 22, 2008 memo from Judith Caden, VA\nDirector of Loan Guaranty Service issued this proclamation in Circular\n26-08-10. Bank of America still retained this position with VA until 2011.\n\n##\nFinances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Finances\")]\n\n###\n2005[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: 2005\")]\n\nFor year-ending Dec 31, 2005, amounts in thousands of dollars:[58]\n\n  * Total Assets: $235,085,370\n  * Total Revenues: $13,016,708\n  * Total Expenses: $5,868,942\n  * Net Earnings: $2,528,090\n  * Pre-tax Earnings by Segment: \n    * Mortgage Banking: $2,434,525\n    * Banking: $1,074,480\n    * Capital Markets: $451,629\n    * Insurance: $183,716\n    * Global: $35,353\n    * Other: $(31,937)\n\n###\n2006[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: 2006\")]\n\nFor year-ending Dec 31, 2006, amounts in thousands of dollars:[59]\n\n  * Total Assets: $85,946,230\n  * Total Revenues: $5,417,128\n  * Total Expenses: $5,082,993\n  * Net Earnings: $1,674,846\n  * Pre-tax Earnings by Segment: \n    * Mortgage Banking: $2,062,399\n    * Banking: $1,080,384\n    * Capital Markets: $253,500\n    * Insurance: $120,133\n    * Global: $28,642\n    * Other: $(10,923)\n\nIn its 2006 annual report to the SEC, CFC disclosed that 19% of its subprime\nloans were delinquent.[60]\n\n###\n2007[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: 2007\")]\n\nFor year-ending Dec 31, 2007, amounts in thousands of dollars:[61]\n\n  * Total Assets: $211,730,061\n  * Total Revenues: $6,061,437\n  * Total Expenses: $6,764,975\n  * Net Earnings: $(703,538)\n  * Pre-tax Earnings by Segment: \n    * Mortgage Banking: $(1,517,083)\n    * Banking: $(268,752)\n    * Capital Markets: $14,957\n    * Insurance: $600,542\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [United States housing bubble](/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble \"United States housing bubble\")\n  * [New Century Financial](/wiki/New_Century_Financial \"New Century Financial\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bank_of_America_Home_Loans&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Paletta, Damian; Enrich, David (July 12, 2008).
