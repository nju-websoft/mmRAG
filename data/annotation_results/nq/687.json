Her grandfather was the\n[ironmaster](/wiki/Ironmaster \"Ironmaster\") [Sir Isaac Lowthian\nBell](/wiki/Lowthian_Bell \"Lowthian Bell\"), an industrialist and a\n[Liberal](/wiki/Liberal_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Liberal Party \\(UK\\)\") Member of\nParliament, in [Benjamin Disraeli](/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli \"Benjamin\nDisraeli\")'s second term. His role in British policy-making exposed Gertrude\nat a young age to international matters and most likely encouraged her\ncuriosity for the world, and her later involvement in international\npolitics.[6]\n\nBell's mother, Mary Shield Bell, died in 1871[7] while giving birth to a son,\n[Maurice (later the 3rd Baronet)](/wiki/Sir_Maurice_Bell,_3rd_Baronet \"Sir\nMaurice Bell, 3rd Baronet\"). Gertrude Bell was just three at the time, and the\ndeath led to a lifelong close relationship with her father, [Sir Hugh Bell,\n2nd Baronet](/wiki/Sir_Hugh_Bell,_2nd_Baronet \"Sir Hugh Bell, 2nd Baronet\"), a\nprogressive capitalist and mill owner who made sure his workers were well paid\nand cared for.[8]:33–34 Throughout her life, Gertrude consulted on political\nmatters with her father, who had also served for many years in various\ngovernmental positions.\n\nSome biographies suggest that the loss of her mother caused underlying\nchildhood trauma, revealed through periods of depression and risky behaviour.\nBut when Gertrude was seven years old her father remarried, providing her a\nstepmother, [Florence Bell](/wiki/Florence_Bell_\\(writer\\) \"Florence Bell\n\\(writer\\)\") (née Olliffe), and eventually, three half-siblings. Florence Bell\nwas a playwright and author of children's stories, as well as the author of a\nstudy of Bell factory workers. She instilled concepts of duty and decorum in\nGertrude and contributed to her intellectual development. Florence Bell's\nactivities with the wives of [Bolckow Vaughan](/wiki/Bolckow_Vaughan \"Bolckow\nVaughan\") ironworkers in [Eston](/wiki/Eston \"Eston\"), near\n[Middlesbrough](/wiki/Middlesbrough \"Middlesbrough\"), may have helped\ninfluence her step-daughter's later stance promoting education of Iraqi\nwomen.[9]\n\nGertrude Bell received her early education from [Queen's\nCollege](/wiki/Queen%27s_College,_London \"Queen's College, London\") in London\nand then later at [Lady Margaret Hall](/wiki/Lady_Margaret_Hall \"Lady Margaret\nHall\"), [Oxford University](/wiki/Oxford_University \"Oxford University\"),[10]\nat the age of 17. History was one of the few subjects women were allowed to\nstudy, due to the many restrictions imposed on them at the time. She\nspecialised in modern history, and it was said that she was first woman to\ngraduate from Modern History at Oxford with a [first class honours\ndegree](/wiki/First_class_honours_degree \"First class honours degree\"), a feat\nshe achieved in only two years.[11]:41 Actually eleven people graduated that\nyear. Nine were recorded because they were men but the other two were Bell and\n[Alice Greenwood](/wiki/Alice_Greenwood \"Alice Greenwood\").[12]\n\n\"_The history lecturer at Queens Collage at that time was Mr.Gramb, a\ndistinguished and inspiring teacher. Gertrude 's intelligence and aptitude for\nhistory impressed him keenly, and he strongly urged us to let her go to Oxford\nand go on for the History School.The time had not yet come when it was a usual\npart of a girl's education to go to a University, and it was with some qualms\nthat we consented._ _But the result justified our decision. Gertrude went to\nLady Margaret Hall, in 1886 just before she was eighteen, she left it in June\n1888 just before she was twenty, and wound up, after those two years, by\ntaking a brilliant First Class in Modern History \"._[13]\n\nBell never married or had children. She befriended British colonial\nadministrator Sir [Frank Swettenham](/wiki/Frank_Swettenham \"Frank\nSwettenham\") on a visit to Singapore with her brother Hugo in 1903 and\nmaintained a correspondence with him until 1909.[14] She had a \"brief but\npassionate affair\" with Swettenham following his retirement to England in\n1904.[15] She also had an unconsummated affair with\n[Maj.](/wiki/Major_\\(United_Kingdom\\) \"Major \\(United Kingdom\\)\") [Charles\nDoughty-Wylie](/wiki/Charles_Doughty-Wylie \"Charles Doughty-Wylie\"), a married\nman, with whom she exchanged love letters from 1913 to 1915.[16]:14–17 After\nhis death in 1915 during the [Gallipoli Campaign](/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign\n\"Gallipoli Campaign\"), Bell launched herself into her work.\n\n## Travels and\nwritings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Travels and writings\")]\n\nBell's uncle, Sir [Frank Lascelles](/wiki/Frank_Lascelles_\\(diplomat\\) \"Frank\nLascelles \\(diplomat\\)\"), was British minister ([similar to\nambassador](/wiki/Minister_\\(diplomacy\\)#Ranks \"Minister \\(diplomacy\\)\")) at\n[Tehran](/wiki/Tehran \"Tehran\"), [Persia](/wiki/Persia \"Persia\"). In May 1892,\nafter leaving Oxford, Bell travelled to [Persia](/wiki/Persia \"Persia\") to\nvisit him. She described this journey in her book, _Persian Pictures_ , which\nwas published in 1894. She spent much of the next decade travelling around the\nworld, [mountaineering](/wiki/Mountaineering \"Mountaineering\") in Switzerland,\nand developing a passion for archaeology and languages. She had become fluent\nin Arabic, Persian, French and German as well as also speaking Italian and\nTurkish. In 1899, Bell again went to the Middle East. She visited\n[Palestine](/wiki/Palestine_\\(region\\) \"Palestine \\(region\\)\") and\n[Syria](/wiki/Syria \"Syria\") that year and in 1900, on a trip from\n[Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\") to Damascus, she became acquainted\nwith the [Druze](/wiki/Druze \"Druze\") living in [Jabal al-\nDruze](/wiki/Jabal_al-Druze \"Jabal al-Druze\").[17] She travelled across Arabia\nsix times during the next 12 years.[17]\n\nBetween 1899 and 1904, she conquered a number of mountains including the La\n[Meije](/wiki/Meije \"Meije\") and [Mont Blanc](/wiki/Mont_Blanc \"Mont Blanc\")\nas she recorded 10 new paths or first ascents in the [Bernese\nAlps](/wiki/Bernese_Alps \"Bernese Alps\"). One Alpine peak in the [Bernese\nOberland](/wiki/Bernese_Oberland \"Bernese Oberland\"), the 2,632 m (8,635 ft)\nGertrudspitze, was named after her after it was first traversed by her and her\nguides Ulrich and Heinrich Fuhrer in 1901. However, she did fail in an attempt\nof the [Finsteraarhorn](/wiki/Finsteraarhorn \"Finsteraarhorn\") in August 1902\nwhen inclement weather including snow, hail and lightning forced her to spend\n\"forty eight hours on the rope\" with her guides, clinging to the rock face in\nterrifying conditions which nearly cost her her life.[18]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/BinbirkiliseBell.jpg/280px-\nBinbirkiliseBell.jpg)](/wiki/File:BinbirkiliseBell.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:BinbirkiliseBell.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBell's workers at the [Binbirkilise](/wiki/Binbirkilise \"Binbirkilise\")\nexcavations in 1907\n\nShe published her observations of the Middle East in the book _Syria: The\nDesert and the Sown_ published in 1907 (William Heinemann Ltd, London). In\nthis book she described, photographed and detailed her trip to Greater\n[Syria](/wiki/Syria \"Syria\")'s towns and cities like [Damascus](/wiki/Damascus\n\"Damascus\"), [Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\"), [Beirut](/wiki/Beirut\n\"Beirut\"), [Antioch](/wiki/Antioch \"Antioch\") and\n[Alexandretta](/wiki/Alexandretta \"Alexandretta\"). Bell's vivid descriptions\nopened up the Arabian [deserts](/wiki/Deserts \"Deserts\") to the western world.\nIn March 1907, Bell journeyed to the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire\n\"Ottoman Empire\") and began to work with the archaeologist and [New\nTestament](/wiki/New_Testament \"New Testament\") scholar Sir [William M.\nRamsay](/wiki/William_M._Ramsay \"William M. Ramsay\"). Their excavations in\n[Binbirkilise](/wiki/Binbirkilise \"Binbirkilise\") were chronicled in _A\nThousand and One Churches_.[19] In 1907, they discovered a field of ruins in\nnorthern Syria on the east bank of the upper course of the Euphrates to the\nsteep slope of the former river valley. From the ruins, they created a plan\nand described the ramparts: \"[Munbayah](/wiki/Mumbaqat \"Mumbaqat\"), where my\ntents were pitched – the Arabic name means only a high-altitude course – was\nprobably the Bersiba in Ptolemy's list of city names. It consists of a double\nrampart, situated on the river bank.\"[20]\n\nIn January 1909, she left for [Mesopotamia](/wiki/Mesopotamia \"Mesopotamia\").\nShe visited the [Hittite](/wiki/Hittites \"Hittites\") city of\n[Carchemish](/wiki/Carchemish \"Carchemish\"), mapped and described the ruin of\n[Ukhaidir](/wiki/Ukhaidir \"Ukhaidir\") and finally went to\n[Babylon](/wiki/Babylon \"Babylon\") and [Najaf](/wiki/Najaf \"Najaf\"). Back in\nCarchemish, she consulted with the two archaeologists on site. One of them was\n[T. E. Lawrence](/wiki/T._E._Lawrence \"T. E. Lawrence\"), assistant to Reginald\nCampbell-Thompson. In 1913, she completed her last and most arduous Arabian\njourney, travelling around 1800 miles from [Damascus](/wiki/Damascus\n\"Damascus\") to the politically volatile [Ha'il](/wiki/Ha%27il \"Ha'il\"), back\nup across the Arabian peninsula to [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\") and from\nthere back to [Damascus](/wiki/Damascus \"Damascus\"). She was only the second\nforeign woman after [Lady Anne Blunt](/wiki/Lady_Anne_Blunt \"Lady Anne Blunt\")\nto visit [Ha'il](/wiki/Ha%27il \"Ha'il\"), and arriving during a period of\nparticular instability was held in the city for eleven days.[11]:218–219\n\nIn 1927, a year after her death, her stepmother [Dame Florence\nBell](/wiki/Florence_Bell_\\(writer\\) \"Florence Bell \\(writer\\)\") published two\nvolumes of Bell's collected correspondence written during the 20 years\npreceding [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\").[1]\n\n## War and political\ncareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: War and political career\")]\n\nAt the outbreak of [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\"), Bell's\nrequest for a Middle East posting was initially denied. She instead\nvolunteered with the [Red Cross](/wiki/Red_Cross \"Red Cross\") in France.\n\nLater, she was asked by [British Intelligence](/wiki/British_Intelligence\n\"British Intelligence\") to get soldiers through the deserts, and from the\nWorld War I period until her death she was the only woman holding political\npower and influence in shaping British imperial policy in the Middle East. She\noften acquired a team of locals which she directed and led on her expeditions.\nThroughout her travels Bell established close relations with tribe members\nacross the Middle East. Additionally, being a woman gave her exclusive access\nto the chambers of wives of tribe leaders, giving her access to other\nperspectives and functions.\n\n### Cairo and\nBasra[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Cairo and Basra\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Harry_St._John_Bridger_Philby.jpg/199px-\nHarry_St._John_Bridger_Philby.jpg)](/wiki/File:Harry_St._John_Bridger_Philby.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Harry_St._John_Bridger_Philby.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[St John Philby](/wiki/St_John_Philby \"St John Philby\")\n\nIn November 1915 she was summoned to [Cairo](/wiki/Cairo \"Cairo\") to the\nnascent [Arab Bureau](/wiki/Arab_Bureau \"Arab Bureau\"), headed by General\n[Gilbert Clayton](/wiki/Gilbert_Clayton \"Gilbert Clayton\"). She also again met\n[T. E. Lawrence](/wiki/T._E._Lawrence \"T. E. Lawrence\").[8]:160–161\n\nBoth Bell and Lawrence had attended Oxford and earned a [First Class\nHonours](/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification \"British\nundergraduate degree classification\") in Modern History, both spoke fluent\nArabic and both had travelled extensively in the Arabian desert and\nestablished ties with the local tribes before World War I. Renowned\narchaeologist and historian Lt. Cmdr. [David\nHogarth](/wiki/David_George_Hogarth \"David George Hogarth\") recognised the\nvalue of Lawrence and Bell's expertise and upon his recommendation first\nLawrence, then Bell, were assigned to Army Intelligence Headquarters in\n[Cairo](/wiki/Cairo \"Cairo\") in 1915 for war service.\n\nArriving in February 1916, she did not, at first, receive an official\nposition, but instead helped Hogarth set about organising and processing her\nown, Lawrence's and [Capt. W. H. I.\nShakespear](/wiki/William_Shakespear_\\(explorer\\) \"William Shakespear\n\\(explorer\\)\")'s data about the location and disposition of [Arab](/wiki/Arab\n\"Arab\") tribes that could be encouraged to join the British against the\nOttoman Empire. Lawrence and the British used the information in forming\nalliances with the Arabs.\n\nOn 3 March 1916, Gen. Clayton abruptly sent Bell to [Basra](/wiki/Basra\n\"Basra\"), which British forces had captured in November 1914, to advise Chief\nPolitical Officer [Percy Cox](/wiki/Percy_Cox \"Percy Cox\") regarding an area\nshe knew better than any other Westerner. Cox found her an office in his\nheadquarters, where she was employed for the two days per week she was not at\nMilitary GHQ Basra.[21] She drew maps to help the British army reach\n[Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\") safely. She became the only female\n[political officer](/wiki/Political_officer_\\(British_Empire\\) \"Political\nofficer \\(British Empire\\)\") in the British forces and received the title of\n\"Liaison Officer, Correspondent to Cairo\" (i.e. to the Arab Bureau where she\nhad been assigned). She was [St. John Philby](/wiki/St._John_Philby \"St. John\nPhilby\")'s field controller, and taught him the finer arts of behind-the-\nscenes political manoeuvering.\n\n> I went out last week along the light railway 25 miles into the desert it's\n> the Nasariyeh Railway - ...it was so curious to travel 50 minutes by rail\n> and find...General Maude, our new army commander, has just arrived. I've\n> made his acquaintance...\"[22]\n\n### Armenian\ngenocide[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Armenian genocide\")]\n\nWhile in the Middle East, Gertrude Bell was a [witness to\nthe](/wiki/Witnesses_and_testimonies_of_the_Armenian_Genocide \"Witnesses and\ntestimonies of the Armenian Genocide\") [Armenian\nGenocide](/wiki/Armenian_Genocide \"Armenian Genocide\"). Contrasting them with\nprevious massacres, she wrote that the massacres of preceding years \"were not\ncomparable to the massacres carried out in 1915 and the succeeding years.\"[23]\nBell also reported that in Damascus, \"Turks sold Armenian women openly in the\npublic market.\"[24] In an intelligence report, Bell wrote:\n\n> The battalion left Aleppo on 3 February and reached Ras al-Ain in twelve\n> hours....some 12,000 Armenians were concentrated under the guardianship of\n> some hundred Kurds...These Kurds were called gendarmes, but in reality mere\n> butchers; bands of them were publicly ordered to take parties of Armenians,\n> of both sexes, to various destinations, but had secret instructions to\n> destroy the males, children and old women...One of these gendarmes confessed\n> to killing 100 Armenian men himself...the empty desert cisterns and caves\n> were also filled with corpses...No man can ever think of a woman's body\n> except as a matter of horror, instead of attraction, after Ras al-Ain.\"[25]\n\n### Creation of\nIraq[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Creation of Iraq\")]\n\nAfter British troops took Baghdad on 10 March 1917, Bell was summoned by Cox\nto Baghdad[8]:274–276 and given the title of \"Oriental Secretary.\" As the\ndismantling of the Ottoman Empire was finalised by the end of the war in late\nJanuary 1919, Bell was assigned to conduct an analysis of the situation in\nMesopotamia. Due to her familiarity and relations with the tribes in the area\nshe had strong ideas about the leadership needed in Iraq. She spent the next\nten months writing what was later considered a masterly official report, \"Self\nDetermination in Mesopotamia\".[26] The British Commissioner in Mesopotamia,\n[Arnold Wilson](/wiki/Arnold_Wilson \"Arnold Wilson\"), had different ideas of\nhow Iraq should be run, preferring an Arab government to be under the\ninfluence of British officials who would retain real control, as he felt, from\nexperience, that Mesopotamian populations were not yet ready to govern and\nadminister the country efficiently and peacefully.\n\nOn 11 October 1920, [Percy Cox](/wiki/Percy_Cox \"Percy Cox\") returned to\nBaghdad and asked her to continue as Oriental Secretary, acting as liaison\nwith the forthcoming Arab government. Gertrude Bell essentially played the\nrole of mediator between the Arab government and British officials. Bell often\nhad to mediate between the various groups of Iraq including a majority\npopulation of Shias in the southern region, Sunnis in central Iraq, and the\nKurds, mostly in the northern region, who wished to be autonomous. Keeping\nthese groups united was essential for political balance in Iraq and for\nBritish imperial interests. Iraq not only contained valuable resources in oil\nbut would act as a buffer zone, with the help of Kurds in the north as a\nstanding army in the region to protect against [Turkey](/wiki/Turkey\n\"Turkey\"), Persia (Iran), and Syria. British officials in London, especially\nChurchill, were highly concerned about cutting heavy costs in the colonies,\nincluding the cost of quashing tribal infighting. Another important project\nfor both the British and new Iraqi rulers was creating a new identity for\nthese people so that they would identify themselves as one nation.[27]\n\nBritish officials quickly realised that their strategies in governing were\nadding to costs. Iraq would be cheaper as a self-governing state. The [Cairo\nConference of 1921](/wiki/Cairo_Conference_\\(1921\\) \"Cairo Conference\n\\(1921\\)\") was held to determine the political and geographic structure of\nwhat later became Iraq and the modern Middle East.[8]:365–369 Significant\ninput was given by Gertrude Bell in these discussions thus she was an\nessential part of its creation. At the Cairo Conference Bell and Lawrence\nhighly recommended [Faisal bin Hussein](/wiki/Faisal_bin_Hussein \"Faisal bin\nHussein\"), (the son of Hussein, [Sherif of Mecca](/wiki/Sherif_of_Mecca\n\"Sherif of Mecca\")), former commander of the Arab forces that helped the\nBritish during the war and entered Damascus at the culmination of the Arab\nRevolt. He had been recently deposed by France as [King of\nSyria](/wiki/King_of_Syria \"King of Syria\"), and British officials at the\nCairo Conference decided to make him the first [King of\nIraq](/wiki/King_of_Iraq \"King of Iraq\"). They believed that due to his\nlineage as a Hashemite and his diplomatic skills he would be respected and\nhave the ability to unite the various groups in the country. Shias would\nrespect him because of his lineage from [Muhammad](/wiki/Muhammad \"Muhammad\").\nSunnis, including Kurds, would follow him because he was Sunni from a\nrespected family. Keeping all the groups under control in Iraq was essential\nto balance the political and economic interests of the British Empire.\n\nUpon Faisal's arrival in 1921, Bell advised him on local questions, including\nmatters involving tribal geography and local business. She also supervised the\nselection of appointees for cabinet and other leadership posts in the new\ngovernment. Referred to by Arabs as \"al-Khatun\" (a Lady of the Court who keeps\nan open eye and ear for the benefit of the State), she was a confidante of\nKing Faisal of Iraq and helped ease his passage into the role, amongst Iraq's\nother tribal leaders at the start of his reign. He helped her to found\nBaghdad's [Iraqi Archaeological Museum](/wiki/National_Museum_of_Iraq\n\"National Museum of Iraq\") from her own modest artefact collection and to\nestablish The British School of Archaeology, Iraq, for the endowment of\nexcavation projects from proceeds in her will. The stress of authoring a\nprodigious output of books, correspondence, intelligence reports, reference\nworks, and white papers; of recurring bronchitis attacks brought on by years\nof heavy smoking in the company of English and Arab cohorts; of bouts with\nmalaria; and finally, of coping with Baghdad's summer heat all took a toll on\nher health. Somewhat frail to start with, she became emaciated.\n\nSome consider the present troubles in Iraq to be derived from the political\nboundaries Bell conceived to create its borders. Her reports, however,\nindicate that problems were foreseen, and that it was clearly understood that\nthere were just not many (if any) permanent solutions for calming the divisive\nforces at work in that part of the world.[8]:413–419\n\nThroughout the early 1920s Bell was an integral part of the administration of\nIraq. The new Hashemite monarchy used the Sharifian flag, which consisted of a\nblack stripe representing the [Abbasid caliphate](/wiki/Abbasid_caliphate\n\"Abbasid caliphate\"), white stripe representing the [Umayyad\ncaliphate](/wiki/Umayyad_caliphate \"Umayyad caliphate\"), and a green stripe\nfor [Fatimid Dynasty](/wiki/Fatimid_Dynasty \"Fatimid Dynasty\"), and lastly a\nred triangle to set across the three bands symbolising Islam. Bell felt it\nessential to customise it for Iraq by adding a gold star to the\ndesign.[16]:149 Faisal was crowned king of Iraq on 23 August 1921, but he was\nnot completely welcomed. Utilizing Shi'ite history to gain support for Faisal,\nduring the holy month of [Muharram](/wiki/Muharram \"Muharram\"), Bell compared\nFaisal's arrival in Baghdad to Husayn, grandson of Muhammad.\n\nHowever, she did not find working with the new king to be easy: \"You may rely\nupon one thing — I'll never engage in creating kings again; it's too great a\nstrain.\"[28]\n\n### 1921\nconference[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: 1921 conference\")]\n\nBell, Cox and Lawrence were among a select group of \"Orientalists\" convened by\n[Winston Churchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill \"Winston Churchill\") to attend a\n[1921 Conference in Cairo](/wiki/Cairo_Conference_\\(1921\\) \"Cairo Conference\n\\(1921\\)\") to determine the [boundaries of the British\nmandate](/wiki/Partitioning_of_the_Ottoman_Empire \"Partitioning of the Ottoman\nEmpire\") (e.g., \"the British Partitions\") and nascent states such as\nIraq.[8]:365–369 Gertrude is supposed to have described Lawrence as being able\n\"to ignite fires in cold rooms\".[29]\n\nThroughout the conference, she, Cox and Lawrence worked tirelessly to promote\nthe establishment of the countries of\n[Transjordan](/wiki/Emirate_of_Transjordan \"Emirate of Transjordan\") and Iraq\nto be presided over by the Kings [Abdullah](/wiki/Abdullah_I_of_Jordan\n\"Abdullah I of Jordan\") and [Faisal](/wiki/Faisal_I_of_Iraq \"Faisal I of\nIraq\"), sons of the instigator of the [Arab Revolt](/wiki/Arab_Revolt \"Arab\nRevolt\") against the Ottoman Empire (ca. 1915–1916), [Hussein bin\nAli](/wiki/Hussein_bin_Ali,_Sharif_of_Mecca \"Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of\nMecca\"), Sharif and Emir of Mecca.[8]:365–369 Until her death in Baghdad, she\nserved in the Iraq British High Commission advisory group there.\n\nBell opposed the [Zionist movement](/wiki/Zionist_movement \"Zionist\nmovement\"), on the grounds that it would be unfair to impose Jewish rule on\nArab inhabitants of Palestine. She wrote that she regarded the [Balfour\nDeclaration](/wiki/Balfour_Declaration \"Balfour Declaration\") with \"the\ndeepest mistrust\" and that \"It's like a nightmare in which you foresee all the\nhorrible things which are going to happen and can`t stretch out your hand to\nprevent them\".[30][31]\n\n[Mark Sykes](/wiki/Mark_Sykes \"Mark Sykes\"), the British diplomat responsible\nfor the [Sykes–Picot Agreement](/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement\n\"Sykes–Picot Agreement\"), was not fond of her.[32]\n\n### National Library of\nIraq[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: National Library of Iraq\")]\n\nIn November 1919, Bell was an invited speaker at a meeting for the promotion\nof a public library in Baghdad, and subsequently served on its Library\nCommittee, as President from 1921 to 1924. The Baghdad Peace Library\n(_Maktabat al-Salam_) was a private, subscription library, but in c.1924 was\ntaken over by the Ministry of Education and became known as the Baghdad Public\nLibrary (or sometimes as the General Library). In 1961, this became the\n[National Library of Iraq](/wiki/Iraq_National_Library_and_Archive \"Iraq\nNational Library and Archive\").\n\n### Baghdad Archaeological\nMuseum[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Baghdad Archaeological Museum\")]\n\nFurther information: [National Museum of Iraq](/wiki/National_Museum_of_Iraq\n\"National Museum of Iraq\")\n\nGertrude Bell's first love had always been archaeology, thus she began forming\nwhat became the Baghdad Archaeological Museum, later renamed the [Iraqi\nMuseum](/wiki/National_Museum_of_Iraq \"National Museum of Iraq\"). Her goal was\nto preserve Iraqi culture and history which included the important relics of\nMesopotamian civilizations, and keep them in their country of origin. She also\nsupervised excavations and examined finds and artifacts. She brought in\nextensive collections, such as from the Babylonian Empire.[27] The museum was\nofficially opened in June 1926, shortly before Bell's death. After her death,\nat the Emir's suggestion, the right wing of the Museum was named as a memorial\nto her.\n\n## Final years[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Final years\")]\n\nWhen Bell briefly returned to Britain in 1925, she faced family problems and\nill health. Her family's fortune had begun to decline due to the onset of\npost-World War I strikes by workers in Britain and economic depression in\nEurope. She returned to Baghdad and soon developed [pleurisy](/wiki/Pleurisy\n\"Pleurisy\"). When she recovered, she heard that her younger half brother Hugh\nhad died of [typhoid](/wiki/Typhoid \"Typhoid\").\n\nOn 12 July 1926, Bell was discovered dead, of an apparent overdose of\n[sleeping pills](/wiki/Sleeping_pills \"Sleeping pills\"). There is much debate\non her death, but it is unknown whether the overdose was an intentional\nsuicide or accidental since she had asked her maid to wake her.[27] In her\nfinal years she became acquainted with [Kinahan\nCornwallis](/wiki/Kinahan_Cornwallis \"Kinahan Cornwallis\") who later wrote an\nintroduction to the posthumously published book _The Arab War, Confidential\nInformation for General Headquarters from Gertrude Bell, Being Despatches\nReprinted from the Secret \"Arab Bulletin\"_.\n\nShe was buried at the British cemetery in Baghdad's Bab al-Sharji\ndistrict.[33] Her funeral was a major event, attended by large numbers of\npeople including her colleagues, British officials and the King of Iraq. It\nwas said King Faisal watched the procession from his private balcony as they\ncarried her coffin to the cemetery.[16]:235\n\n## Legacy and\ntributes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Legacy and tributes\")]\n\n###\nContemporary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Contemporary\")]\n\nAn obituary written by her peer [D. G. Hogarth](/wiki/D._G._Hogarth \"D. G.\nHogarth\") expressed the respect British officials held for her. Hogarth\nhonoured her by saying,\n\n> No woman in recent time has combined her qualities – her taste for arduous\n> and dangerous adventure with her scientific interest and knowledge, her\n> competence in archaeology and art, her distinguished literary gift, her\n> sympathy for all sorts and condition of men, her political insight and\n> appreciation of human values, her masculine vigour, hard common sense and\n> practical efficiency – all tempered by feminine charm and a most romantic\n> spirit.[34]\n\n### Modern[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Modern\")]\n\nGertrude Bell is remembered in Iraq in the 21st century. The British diplomat,\ntravel writer and Member of Parliament [Rory Stewart](/wiki/Rory_Stewart \"Rory\nStewart\") wrote:\n\n> When I served as a British official in southern Iraq in 2003, I often heard\n> Iraqis compare my female colleagues to \"Gertrude Bell.\" It was generally\n> casual flattery, and yet the example of Bell and her colleagues was\n> unsettling. More than ten biographies have portrayed her as the ideal\n> Arabist, political analyst, and administrator.\n>\n> — Rory Stewart[35]\n\nStewart notes that Bell was \"both more lively and more honest\" than political\nstatements in his time.[35] He quotes six examples of her writing, the\nshortest of which is \"No one knows exactly what they do want, least of all\nthemselves, except that they don’t want us.\"[35] He quotes Bell's colleague,\nT. E. Lawrence (of Arabia), as saying that she was \"not a good judge of men or\nsituations\",[36] and observes that \"If there was no ideal solution, however,\nthere were still clear mistakes. Bell should never have acquiesced in the\ninclusion of the Kurdish-dominated province of Mosul in Iraq.\"[36] However,\nStewart praises her 1920 White Paper, comparing it to [General\nPetraeus](/wiki/General_Petraeus \"General Petraeus\")'s report to the US\nCongress.[36]\n\n### Film[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Film\")]\n\n  * In 1992, Bell was portrayed by [Gillian Barge](/wiki/Gillian_Barge \"Gillian Barge\") in the ITV television film [A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia](/wiki/A_Dangerous_Man:_Lawrence_After_Arabia \"A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia\").\n  * In 2015, [Werner Herzog](/wiki/Werner_Herzog \"Werner Herzog\") released [_Queen of the Desert_](/wiki/Queen_of_the_Desert_\\(film\\) \"Queen of the Desert \\(film\\)\"). The film chronicles much of Bell's life and in it she is portrayed by [Nicole Kidman](/wiki/Nicole_Kidman \"Nicole Kidman\").[37]\n  * In 2016, the documentary _[Letters from Baghdad](/wiki/Letters_from_Baghdad \"Letters from Baghdad\")_ based on Gertrude Bell's and her contemporaries' own writings was released. The film was directed and produced by [Zeva Oelbaum](/w/index.php?title=Zeva_Oelbaum&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Zeva Oelbaum \\(page does not exist\\)\") and [Sabine Krayenbühl](/w/index.php?title=Sabine_Krayenb%C3%BChl&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Sabine Krayenbühl \\(page does not exist\\)\"). The quotations from Bell's letters were read by [Tilda Swinton](/wiki/Tilda_Swinton \"Tilda Swinton\").[38][39]\n\n### Posthumous\ntributes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Posthumous tributes\")]\n\nGertrude Bell's work was specially mentioned in the [British\nParliament](/wiki/British_Parliament \"British Parliament\"), and she was\nawarded the [Order of the British Empire](/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire\n\"Order of the British Empire\").\n\nA stained-glass window dedicated to her memory, made by [Douglas\nStrachan](/wiki/Douglas_Strachan \"Douglas Strachan\"), was erected in St\nLawrence's Church, [East Rounton, North\nYorkshire](/wiki/East_Rounton,_North_Yorkshire \"East Rounton, North\nYorkshire\"). It depicts Magdalen College, Oxford, and Khadimain, Baghdad.[40]\nThe inscription reads:\n\n> This window is in remembrance of Gertrude Versed in the learning of the east\n> and of the west Servant of the state Scholar Poet Historian Antiquary\n> Gardener Mountaineer Explorer Lover of nature of flowers and of animals\n> Incomparable friend sister daughter.[41]\n\n### Museum[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Museum\")]\n\nIn 2016, a campaign was launched to transform Bell's family estate, Red Barns,\ninto a memorial and museum. The family were patrons to the [Arts and Crafts\nmovement](/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement \"Arts and Crafts movement\") in\nEngland, and the home, located in [Redcar](/wiki/Redcar \"Redcar\"), features\nwallpaper by movement leader [William Morris](/wiki/William_Morris \"William\nMorris\"). The building is Grade II* listed among historical buildings, however\nit has lacked upkeep in recent years. Turning the building into a memorial to\nGertrude is partially the result of a popular 2015 exhibition about her at the\n[Great North Museum](/wiki/Great_North_Museum \"Great North Museum\") in\n[Newcastle](/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne \"Newcastle upon Tyne\"). The exhibition\nmoved to the [Kirkleatham](/wiki/Kirkleatham \"Kirkleatham\") Museum in Redcar\nafter its run in Newcastle.[42]\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Daughter of John Shield of Newcastle-on-Tyne.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Bell, Gertrude (1927).
