The hard-swinging, bluesy transition style is\nbracketed by [Count Basie](/wiki/Count_Basie \"Count Basie\") who in 1929 signed\nwith the [Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra](/wiki/Bennie_Moten \"Bennie\nMoten\") and Kansas City native [Charlie Parker](/wiki/Charlie_Parker \"Charlie\nParker\") who was to usher in the Bebop style in the 1940s. According to a\nKansas City website, \"While [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\") was\nthe birthplace of jazz, America's music grew up in Kansas City\".[1] Kansas\nCity is known as one of the most popular \"cradles of jazz\". Other cities\ninclude New Orleans, [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\"), [St.\nLouis](/wiki/St._Louis \"St. Louis\"), [Pittsburgh](/wiki/Pittsburgh\n\"Pittsburgh\"), [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\"), and [New\nYork City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\").[2][3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Style\n  * 3 Aftermath\n  * 4 Musicians\n  * 5 Selected discography\n  * 6 Literature\n  * 7 References\n\n## Background[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kansas_City_jazz&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nThe first band from Kansas City to acquire a national reputation was the\n[Coon-Sanders Original Nighthawk Orchestra](/wiki/Coon-\nSanders_Original_Nighthawk_Orchestra \"Coon-Sanders Original Nighthawk\nOrchestra\"), a white group which broadcast nationally in the 1920s. However,\nthe Kansas City jazz school is identified with the black bands of the 1920s\nand 1930s.\n\nKansas City in the 1930s was very much the crossroads of the United States\nresulting in a mix of cultures. Transcontinental trips at the time whether by\nplane or train often required a stop in the city. The era marked the zenith of\npower of political boss [Tom Pendergast](/wiki/Tom_Pendergast \"Tom\nPendergast\"). Kansas City was a wide open town with liquor laws and hours\ntotally ignored and was called the new\n[Storyville](/wiki/Storyville,_New_Orleans \"Storyville, New Orleans\"). Most of\nthe jazz musicians associated with the style were born in other places but got\ncaught up in the friendly musical competitions among performers that could\nkeep a single song being performed in variations for an entire night. Often\nmembers of the big bands would perform at regular venues earlier in the\nevening and go to the jazz clubs later to jam for the rest of the night.\n\n[Claude Williams](/wiki/Claude_Williams_\\(musician\\) \"Claude Williams\n\\(musician\\)\") described the scene:\n\n    Kansas City was different from all other places because we'd be jamming all night. And [if] you come up here ... playing the wrong thing, we'd straighten you out.[4]\n\nClubs were scattered throughout city but the most fertile area was the [inner\ncity](/wiki/Inner_city \"Inner city\") neighborhood of [18th Street and\nVine](/wiki/18th_and_Vine_Historic_District \"18th and Vine Historic\nDistrict\").\n\nAmong the clubs were the Amos 'n' Andy, Boulevard Lounge, Cherry Blossom,\nChesterfield Club, Chocolate Bar, Dante's Inferno, Elk's Rest, Hawaiian\nGardens, Hell's Kitchen, the Hi Hat, the Hey Hey, Lone Star, Old Kentucky Bar-\nB-Que, Paseo Ballroom, Pla-Mor Ballroom, Reno Club, Spinning Wheel, Street's\nBlue Room, Subway, and Sunsetx.\n\n## Style[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kansas_City_jazz&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Style\")]\n\nKansas City jazz is distinguished by the following musical elements:\n\n  * A preference for a 4 feel (walking) over the 2 beat feel found in other jazz styles of the time. As a result, Kansas city jazz had a more relaxed, fluid sound than other jazz styles.\n  * Extended soloing. Fueled by the non-stop nightlife under political boss [Tom Pendergast](/wiki/Tom_Pendergast \"Tom Pendergast\"), Kansas City jam sessions went on well past sunrise, fostering a highly competitive atmosphere and a unique jazz culture in which the goal was to \"say something\" with one's instrument, rather than simply show off one's technique. It was not uncommon for one \"song\" to be performed for several hours, with the best musicians often soloing for dozens of choruses at a time.\n  * So-called \"head arrangements\". The KC big bands often played by memory, composing and arranging the music collectively, rather than sight-reading as other big bands of the time did. This further contributed to the loose, spontaneous Kansas City sound.\n  * A heavy blues influence, with KC songs often based around a [12-bar blues](/wiki/12-bar_blues \"12-bar blues\") structure, rather than the 32 bar AABA standard, although [Moten Swing](/wiki/Moten_Swing \"Moten Swing\") is in this AABA format.\n  * One of the most recognizable characteristics of Kansas City jazz is frequent, elaborate riffing by the different sections. Riffs were often created - or even improvised - collectively, and took many forms: a) one section riffing alone, serving as the main focus of the music; b) one section riffing behind a soloist, adding excitement to the song; or c) two or more sections riffing in counterpoint, creating an exciting hard-swinging sound. The Count Basie signature tunes \"[One O'Clock Jump](/wiki/One_O%27Clock_Jump \"One O'Clock Jump\")\" and \"[Jumpin' at the Woodside](/wiki/Jumpin%27_at_the_Woodside \"Jumpin' at the Woodside\")\", for example, are simply collections of complex riffs, memorized in a head arrangement, and punctuated with solos. [Glenn Miller](/wiki/Glenn_Miller \"Glenn Miller\")'s famous swing anthem \"[In the Mood](/wiki/In_the_Mood \"In the Mood\")\" closely follows the Kansas City pattern of riffing sections, and is a good example of the Kansas City style after it had been exported to the rest of the world.\n\n## Aftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kansas_City_jazz&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\nKansas City influence overtly transferred to the national scene in 1936 when\nrecord producer [John H. Hammond](/wiki/John_H._Hammond \"John H. Hammond\")\ncemented his career by discovering Kansas City talent, in the shape of Count\nBasie.\n\nPendergast was to be convicted of income tax evasion in 1940 and the city\ncracked down on the clubs effectively ending the era.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s Kansas City has attempted to celebrate the heritage by\ntaking off the rough edges for family friendly environments. In the 1970s, the\ncity tried to create a jazz enclave in the [River Quay](/wiki/River_Quay\n\"River Quay\") area on the Missouri River in the City Market neighborhood.\nThree of the clubs were bombed during a mob war that ultimately also led to\nthe demise of mob influence of Las Vegas casinos that was depicted in the 1995\nmovie _[Casino](/wiki/Casino_\\(film\\) \"Casino \\(film\\)\")_.\n\nIn 1979, [Bruce Ricker](/wiki/Bruce_Ricker \"Bruce Ricker\") filmed _[The Last\nof the Blue Devils](/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Blue_Devils \"The Last of the Blue\nDevils\")_ , a documentary starring Basie and singer [Big Joe\nTurner](/wiki/Big_Joe_Turner \"Big Joe Turner\"), and featuring many performers\nfrom the original era.\n\nIn 1981 114 people died in the [Hyatt Regency walkway\ncollapse](/wiki/Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapse \"Hyatt Regency walkway\ncollapse\") in an attempted recreation of the jazz scene during a [tea\ndance](/wiki/Tea_dance \"Tea dance\").\n\nIn 1996 Kansas City native [Robert Altman](/wiki/Robert_Altman \"Robert\nAltman\") released the film _[Kansas City](/wiki/Kansas_City_\\(1996_film\\)\n\"Kansas City \\(1996 film\\)\")_ depicting the Kansas City jazz era.\n\nIn 1997 the [American Jazz Museum](/wiki/American_Jazz_Museum \"American Jazz\nMuseum\") opened in the [18th and Vine neighborhood](/wiki/18th_and_Vine-\nDowntown_East,_Kansas_City \"18th and Vine-Downtown East, Kansas City\") with a\nmission of celebrating Kansas City's jazz heritage.\n\nEach year Kansas City celebrates \"Jazzoo\" \\- a charity fundraiser dedicated to\nKansas City jazz and raising funds for the Kansas City Zoo. In 2011, Jazzoo\nwas one of the Nation's largest charity fundraisers, raising over $800,000.[5]\n\n## Musicians[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kansas_City_jazz&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Musicians\")]\n\n  * [Count Basie](/wiki/Count_Basie \"Count Basie\")\n  * [Earl Carruthers](/wiki/Earl_Carruthers \"Earl Carruthers\")\n  * [Buck Clayton](/wiki/Buck_Clayton \"Buck Clayton\")\n  * [Maxwell Davis](/wiki/Maxwell_Davis \"Maxwell Davis\")\n  * [Herschel Evans](/wiki/Herschel_Evans \"Herschel Evans\")\n  * [Coleman Hawkins](/wiki/Coleman_Hawkins \"Coleman Hawkins\")\n  * [Pete Johnson](/wiki/Pete_Johnson \"Pete Johnson\")\n  * [Jo Jones](/wiki/Jo_Jones \"Jo Jones\")\n  * [Andy Kirk](/wiki/Andy_Kirk_\\(musician\\) \"Andy Kirk \\(musician\\)\")\n  * [Julia Lee](/wiki/Julia_Lee_\\(musician\\) \"Julia Lee \\(musician\\)\")\n  * [George E.
