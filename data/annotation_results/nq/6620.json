This produces a signal\nwhich travels back to the spinal cord and synapses (without interneurons) at\nthe level of L3 in the spinal cord, completely independent of higher centres.\nFrom there, an [alpha motor neuron](/wiki/Alpha_motor_neuron \"Alpha motor\nneuron\") conducts an efferent impulse back to the [quadriceps femoris\nmuscle](/wiki/Quadriceps_femoris_muscle \"Quadriceps femoris muscle\"),\ntriggering contraction. This contraction, coordinated with the relaxation of\nthe antagonistic flexor hamstring muscle causes the leg to kick. This is a\nreflex of proprioception which helps maintain [posture](/wiki/Neutral_spine\n\"Neutral spine\") and [balance](/wiki/Balance_\\(ability\\) \"Balance\n\\(ability\\)\"), allowing to keep one's balance with little effort or conscious\nthought.\n\nThe patellar reflex is a clinical and classic example of the monosynaptic\n[reflex arc](/wiki/Reflex_arc \"Reflex arc\"). There is no\n[interneuron](/wiki/Interneuron \"Interneuron\") in the pathway leading to\ncontraction of the quadriceps muscle. Instead, the bipolar sensory neuron\nsynapses directly on a motor neuron in the spinal cord. However, there _is_ an\ninhibitory interneuron used to relax the antagonistic hamstring muscle\n([Reciprocal innervation](/wiki/Reciprocal_innervation \"Reciprocal\ninnervation\")).\n\nThis test of a basic automatic reflex may be influenced by the patient\nconsciously inhibiting or exaggerating the response; the doctor may use the\n[Jendrassik maneuver](/wiki/Jendrassik_maneuver \"Jendrassik maneuver\") as a\ndistraction or diversion in order to ensure a more valid reflex test.\n\n## Purpose of\ntesting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Patellar_reflex&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Purpose of testing\")]\n\nAfter the tap of a hammer, the leg is normally extended once and comes to\nrest. The absence or decrease of this reflex is problematic, and known as\n[Westphal's sign](/wiki/Westphal%27s_sign \"Westphal's sign\"). This reflex may\nbe diminished or absent in [lower motor neuron\nlesions](/wiki/Lower_motor_neuron_lesion \"Lower motor neuron lesion\") and\nduring sleep. On the other hand, multiple oscillation of the leg (pendular\nreflex) following the tap may be a sign of [cerebellar\ndiseases](/wiki/Cerebellar_diseases \"Cerebellar diseases\"). Exaggerated\n(brisk) deep tendon reflexes such as this can be found in [upper motor neuron\nlesions](/wiki/Upper_motor_neuron_lesion \"Upper motor neuron lesion\"),\n[hyperthyroidism](/wiki/Hyperthyroidism \"Hyperthyroidism\")[3], anxiety or\nnervousness. The test itself assesses the nervous tissue between and including\nthe L2 and L4 segments of the spinal cord.[2]\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Patellar_reflex&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe term _knee-jerk_ was recorded by Sir [Michael\nFoster](/wiki/Michael_Foster_\\(physiologist\\) \"Michael Foster\n\\(physiologist\\)\") in his Textbook of [physiology](/wiki/Physiology\n\"Physiology\") in 1877: \"Striking the tendon below the patella gives rise to a\nsudden extension of the leg, known as the knee-jerk.\"[4]\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Patellar_reflex&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: In popular culture\")]\n\nThe term began to be used figuratively from the early 20th century onwards.\n[O. O. McIntyre](/wiki/O._O._McIntyre \"O. O. McIntyre\"), in his New York Day-\nBy-Day column in [The Coshocton Tribune](/wiki/The_Coshocton_Tribune \"The\nCoshocton Tribune\"), October 1921, wrote: \"Itinerant preacher stemming\nBroadway on a soap box.
