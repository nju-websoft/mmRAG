The story takes place in a\nkingdom of [lions](/wiki/East_African_lion \"East African lion\") in\n[Africa](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\") and was influenced by [William\nShakespeare](/wiki/William_Shakespeare \"William Shakespeare\")'s\n_[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet \"Hamlet\")_.\n\n_The Lion King_ tells the story of [Simba](/wiki/Simba \"Simba\"), a young lion\nwho is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however,\nafter Simba's uncle Scar (Mufasa's jealous younger brother), murders Mufasa,\nSimba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into\n[exile](/wiki/Exile \"Exile\"). Upon maturation living with [two\nwastrels](/wiki/Timon_and_Pumbaa \"Timon and Pumbaa\"), Simba is given some\nvaluable perspective from his childhood friend, [Nala](/wiki/Nala_\\(Disney\\)\n\"Nala \\(Disney\\)\"), and his [shaman](/wiki/Shaman \"Shaman\"), Rafiki, before\nreturning to challenge Scar to end his [tyranny](/wiki/Tyranny \"Tyranny\") and\ntake his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King.\n\nDevelopment of _The Lion King_ began in 1988 during a meeting between [Jeffrey\nKatzenberg](/wiki/Jeffrey_Katzenberg \"Jeffrey Katzenberg\"), [Roy E.\nDisney](/wiki/Roy_E._Disney \"Roy E. Disney\"), and [Peter\nSchneider](/wiki/Peter_Schneider_\\(film_executive\\) \"Peter Schneider \\(film\nexecutive\\)\") while promoting _[Oliver& Company](/wiki/Oliver_%26_Company\n\"Oliver & Company\")_ in Europe. [Thomas Disch](/wiki/Thomas_Disch \"Thomas\nDisch\") wrote a [film treatment](/wiki/Film_treatment \"Film treatment\"), and\nWoolverton developed the first scripts while [George\nScribner](/wiki/George_Scribner \"George Scribner\") was signed on as director,\nbeing later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with\n_[Pocahontas](/wiki/Pocahontas_\\(1995_film\\) \"Pocahontas \\(1995 film\\)\")_ ,\nwhich wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the\nstaff traveled to [Hell's Gate National\nPark](/wiki/Hell%27s_Gate_National_Park \"Hell's Gate National Park\") in\n[Kenya](/wiki/Kenya \"Kenya\") to research on the film's setting and animals,\nScribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a\nmusical and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was\ndissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20\nminutes of animation sequences were produced at [Disney’s Hollywood\nStudios](/wiki/Disney%E2%80%99s_Hollywood_Studios \"Disney’s Hollywood\nStudios\") theme park in Florida. [Computer animation](/wiki/Computer_animation\n\"Computer animation\") was also used in several scenes, most notably in the\n[wildebeest](/wiki/Wildebeest \"Wildebeest\") stampede sequence.\n\n_The Lion King_ was released on June 15, 1994, to a positive reaction from\ncritics, who praised the film for its music, story, and animation. With a\nworldwide gross of $766 million, it finished its theatrical run as the\n[highest-grossing release of 1994](/wiki/1994_in_film#Highest_grossing_films\n\"1994 in film\") and the [second highest-grossing film of all\ntime](/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films \"List of highest-grossing films\").\nIt is also the [highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all\ntime](/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_animated_films#Traditional_animation\n\"List of highest-grossing animated films\"). _The Lion King_ garnered two\n[Academy Awards](/wiki/Academy_Award \"Academy Award\") for its achievement in\nmusic and the [Golden Globe Award](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award \"Golden Globe\nAward\") for [Best Motion Picture – Musical or\nComedy](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Motion_Picture_%E2%80%93_Musical_or_Comedy\n\"Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\"). The film\nhas led to [many derived works](/wiki/The_Lion_King_\\(franchise\\) \"The Lion\nKing \\(franchise\\)\"), such as [a Broadway\nadaptation](/wiki/The_Lion_King_\\(musical\\) \"The Lion King \\(musical\\)\"); two\n[direct-to-video](/wiki/Direct-to-video \"Direct-to-video\") follow-ups—the\nsequel, _[The Lion King II: Simba's\nPride](/wiki/The_Lion_King_II:_Simba%27s_Pride \"The Lion King II: Simba's\nPride\")_ (1998), and the prequel/[parallel](/wiki/Sequel#Parallel \"Sequel\"),\n_[The Lion King 1½](/wiki/The_Lion_King_1%C2%BD \"The Lion King 1½\")_ (2004);\ntwo television series, _[Timon and\nPumbaa](/wiki/Timon_and_Pumbaa_\\(TV_series\\) \"Timon and Pumbaa \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ and _[The Lion Guard](/wiki/The_Lion_Guard \"The Lion Guard\")_ ;\nand a [3D](/wiki/3D_film \"3D film\") re-release, in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [National\nFilm Registry](/wiki/National_Film_Registry \"National Film Registry\") by the\n[Library of Congress](/wiki/Library_of_Congress \"Library of Congress\") as\nbeing \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

King Mufasa's newborn son, [Simba](/wiki/Simba\n\"Simba\"), is presented to the assembled animals by Rafiki the baboon (with the\ncolorful facial marking of a [mandrill](/wiki/Mandrill \"Mandrill\"))[3] who\nserves as [shaman](/wiki/Shamanism \"Shamanism\") and advisor. Mufasa shows\nyoung Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of\nkingship and the \"circle of life\" which connects all living things. Mufasa's\nyounger brother, [Scar](/wiki/Scar_\\(The_Lion_King\\) \"Scar \\(The Lion\nKing\\)\"), covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba so he may\nbecome king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala—to whom Simba is\nbetrothed—into exploring a forbidden [elephants'\ngraveyard](/wiki/Elephants%27_graveyard \"Elephants' graveyard\"), where they\nare attacked by three [spotted hyenas](/wiki/Spotted_hyena \"Spotted hyena\")\nwho are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted to the danger by his\n[majordomo](/wiki/Majordomo \"Majordomo\"), the [hornbill](/wiki/Hornbill\n\"Hornbill\") Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though angry with Simba, Mufasa\nforgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them\nfrom the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.\n\nScar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and\nhaving the hyenas drive a large herd of [wildebeest](/wiki/Wildebeest\n\"Wildebeest\") into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of\nSimba's peril, knowing the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba\nbut ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help\nMufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that\nthe tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to flee the kingdom. He\norders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride\nthat both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as\nthe new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large\npack to live in the Pride Lands.\n\nSimba collapses in a desert and is rescued by [Timon and\nPumbaa](/wiki/Timon_and_Pumbaa \"Timon and Pumbaa\"), a [meerkat](/wiki/Meerkat\n\"Meerkat\") and [warthog](/wiki/Common_warthog \"Common warthog\") who are fellow\noutcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends, living a\ncarefree life under the motto \"[hakuna matata](/wiki/Hakuna_matata \"Hakuna\nmatata\")\" (\"no worries\" in [Swahili](/wiki/Swahili_language \"Swahili\nlanguage\")). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry\nlioness who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and\nshe urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a\ndrought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his\nfather's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells\nhim that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of\nMufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as\nking. Realizing he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return\nhome.\n\nAided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts\nScar. Scar taunts him over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the\nedge of the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged,\nSimba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest\nof the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the\nhyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of\nPride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his\nactions; Simba spares his life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands\nforever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top\nof the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas,\nwho overheard his attempt to betray them. With his enemies gone, Simba takes\nover the kingship as the rains begin to fall, restoring life to the land.\n\nLater, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Rafiki presents Simba and\nNala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.\n\n## Cast\n\nMain article: [List of characters in The Lion\nKing](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_The_Lion_King \"List of characters in The\nLion King\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/LionKingCharacters.jpg/300px-\nLionKingCharacters.jpg)](/wiki/File:LionKingCharacters.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:LionKingCharacters.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA promotional image of the characters from the film.

Disney](/wiki/Roy_E._Disney \"Roy E. Disney\") and [Peter\nSchneider](/wiki/Peter_Schneider_\\(film_executive\\) \"Peter Schneider \\(film\nexecutive\\)\") on a plane to Europe to promote _[Oliver&\nCompany](/wiki/Oliver_%26_Company \"Oliver & Company\")_. During the\nconversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg\nimmediately jumped at the idea.[6] The idea was then developed by [Walt Disney\nFeature Animation](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Feature_Animation \"Walt Disney Feature\nAnimation\")'s vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink.[7] Katzenberg\ndecided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from\npersonal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in\npolitics, saying about the film, \"It is a little bit about myself.\"[8] In\nNovember of that year [Thomas Disch](/wiki/Thomas_Disch \"Thomas Disch\")\n(author of _[The Brave Little\nToaster](/wiki/The_Brave_Little_Toaster_\\(novel\\) \"The Brave Little Toaster\n\\(novel\\)\")_) wrote a [treatment](/wiki/Film_treatment \"Film treatment\")\nentitled _King of the Kalahari_ ,[9] and afterwards, [Linda\nWoolverton](/wiki/Linda_Woolverton \"Linda Woolverton\") spent a year writing\ndrafts of the script, which was titled _King of the Beasts_ and then _King of\nthe Jungle_.[7] The original version of the film was very different from the\nfinal film. The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons\nwith Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah,[8] and\nTimon and Pumbaa being Simba's childhood friends.[10] Simba would also not\nleave the kingdom but become a \"lazy, slovenly, horrible character\" due to\nmanipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age. By\n1990, producer [Thomas Schumacher](/wiki/Thomas_Schumacher \"Thomas\nSchumacher\"), who had just completed _[The Rescuers Down\nUnder](/wiki/The_Rescuers_Down_Under \"The Rescuers Down Under\")_ , decided to\nattach himself to the project \"because lions are cool\".[7] Schumacher likened\nthe script for _King of the Jungle_ to \"an animated _[National\nGeographic](/wiki/National_Geographic_Channel \"National Geographic Channel\")_\nspecial\".[11]\n\n_Oliver & Company_ director [George Scribner](/wiki/George_Scribner \"George\nScribner\") was the initial director of the film,[12] being later joined by\n[Roger Allers](/wiki/Roger_Allers \"Roger Allers\"), who was the lead story man\non _[Beauty and the Beast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty\nand the Beast \\(1991 film\\)\")_ in October 1991.[6] Allers brought with him\n[Brenda Chapman](/wiki/Brenda_Chapman \"Brenda Chapman\"), who would become the\nhead of story.[7] Afterwards, several of the lead crew members, including\nAllers, Scribner, Hahn, Chapman, and production designer [Chris\nSanders](/wiki/Chris_Sanders_\\(director\\) \"Chris Sanders \\(director\\)\"), took\na trip to [Hell's Gate National Park](/wiki/Hell%27s_Gate_National_Park\n\"Hell's Gate National Park\") in Kenya, in order to study and gain an\nappreciation of the environment for the film.[13] After six months of story\ndevelopment work Scribner decided to leave the project, as he clashed with\nAllers and the producers on their decision to turn the film into a musical, as\nScribner's intention was of making a documentary-like film more focused on\nnatural aspects.[6][14] [Rob Minkoff](/wiki/Rob_Minkoff \"Rob Minkoff\")\nreplaced Scribner,[13] and producer [Don Hahn](/wiki/Don_Hahn \"Don Hahn\")\njoined the production as Schumacher became only an executive producer due to\nDisney promoting him to Vice President of Development for Feature\nAnimation.[11] Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme, and\nafter establishing the main theme as \"leaving childhood and facing up to the\nrealities of the world\", asked for a final retool. Allers, Minkoff, Chapman\nand Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors\n[Kirk Wise](/wiki/Kirk_Wise \"Kirk Wise\") and [Gary\nTrousdale](/wiki/Gary_Trousdale \"Gary Trousdale\"), who had just finished\n_Beauty and the Beast_.[13] The script also had its title changed from _King\nof the Jungle_ to _The Lion King_ , as the setting was not the jungle but the\nsavannah.[6]\n\n_The Lion King_ was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story,\nrather than be based on an already existing work. The filmmakers have said\nthat the story of _The Lion King_ was inspired by the lives of\n[Joseph](/wiki/Joseph_\\(patriarch\\) \"Joseph \\(patriarch\\)\") and\n[Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\"), from the Bible, and [William\nShakespeare](/wiki/William_Shakespeare \"William Shakespeare\")'s\n_[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet \"Hamlet\")_.[15] During the summer of 1992, the team was\njoined by screenwriter [Irene Mecchi](/wiki/Irene_Mecchi \"Irene Mecchi\"), with\na second screenwriter, [Jonathan Roberts](/wiki/Jonathan_Roberts_\\(writer\\)\n\"Jonathan Roberts \\(writer\\)\"), joining a few months later. Mecchi and Roberts\ntook charge of the revision process, fixing unresolved emotional issues in the\nscript and adding comic business for Pumbaa, Timon, and the hyenas.[4]\nLyricist [Tim Rice](/wiki/Tim_Rice \"Tim Rice\") worked closely with the writing\nteam, flying to California at least once a month because his songs needed to\nwork in the narrative continuity. Rice's lyrics—which were reworked up to the\nproduction's end—were pinned to the [storyboards](/wiki/Storyboard\n\"Storyboard\") during development.[13] Rewrites were frequent, with animator\n[Andreas Deja](/wiki/Andreas_Deja \"Andreas Deja\") saying that completed scenes\nwould be delivered, only for the response to be that parts needed to be\nreanimated because of dialog changes.[7]\n\n### Casting\n\nThe voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the\ncharacters—for instance, [James Earl Jones](/wiki/James_Earl_Jones \"James Earl\nJones\") was cast because the directors found his voice \"powerful\" and similar\nto a lion's roar.[16] Jones commented that during the years of production,\nMufasa \"became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [a] grand king\".[17]\n\n[Nathan Lane](/wiki/Nathan_Lane \"Nathan Lane\") originally auditioned for\n[Zazu](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_The_Lion_King#Zazu \"List of characters in\nThe Lion King\"), and [Ernie Sabella](/wiki/Ernie_Sabella \"Ernie Sabella\") for\none of the hyenas. Upon meeting each other at the recording studio, the\nactors, who at the time both co-starred in _[Guys and\nDolls](/wiki/Guys_and_Dolls \"Guys and Dolls\")_ , were asked to record together\nas hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast them\nas Timon and Pumbaa.[16][18] For the hyenas, the original intention was to\nreunite [Cheech & Chong](/wiki/Cheech_%26_Chong \"Cheech & Chong\"), but while\n[Cheech Marin](/wiki/Cheech_Marin \"Cheech Marin\") accepted to play Banzai,\n[Tommy Chong](/wiki/Tommy_Chong \"Tommy Chong\") was unavailable. Thus his role\nwas changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by [Whoopi\nGoldberg](/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg \"Whoopi Goldberg\").[10]\n\n[Matthew Broderick](/wiki/Matthew_Broderick \"Matthew Broderick\") was cast as\nadult [Simba](/wiki/Simba \"Simba\") early during production, and during the\nthree years of voice acting only recorded with another actor once, and only\ndiscovered [Moira Kelly](/wiki/Moira_Kelly \"Moira Kelly\") voiced\n[Nala](/wiki/Nala_\\(The_Lion_King\\) \"Nala \\(The Lion King\\)\") at the\npremiere.[19] English actors [Tim Curry](/wiki/Tim_Curry \"Tim Curry\") and\n[Malcolm McDowell](/wiki/Malcolm_McDowell \"Malcolm McDowell\") were originally\nconsidered for the role of [Scar](/wiki/Scar_\\(Disney\\) \"Scar\n\\(Disney\\)\"),[20] however, Curry left the role due to _[Home Alone 2: Lost in\nNew York](/wiki/Home_Alone_2:_Lost_in_New_York \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New\nYork\")_ , and it was ultimately won by English actor [Jeremy\nIrons](/wiki/Jeremy_Irons \"Jeremy Irons\").[21] Irons had at first refused the\nrole due to not being comfortable going from the dramatic performance as\n[Claus von Bülow](/wiki/Claus_von_B%C3%BClow \"Claus von Bülow\") in _[Reversal\nof Fortune](/wiki/Reversal_of_Fortune \"Reversal of Fortune\")_ to a comedic\nrole. But once he came in, Irons' performance even inspired the writers to\nincorporate more of his acting as von Bülow—adding one of that character's\nlines, \"You have no idea\"—and animator Andreas Deja to watch both _Reversal of\nFortune_ and _[Damage](/wiki/Damage_\\(1992_film\\) \"Damage \\(1992 film\\)\")_ to\npick up Irons's facial traits and tics.[17][22]\n\n### Animation\n\n\"_The Lion King_ was considered a little movie because we were going to take\nsome risks. The pitch for the story was a lion cub gets framed for murder by\nhis uncle set to the music of Elton John. People said, 'What? Good luck with\nthat.' But for some reason, the people who ended up on the movie were highly\npassionate about it and motivated.\"\n\nDon Hahn[18]\n\nThe development of _The Lion King_ coincided with that of\n_[Pocahontas](/wiki/Pocahontas_\\(1995_film\\) \"Pocahontas \\(1995 film\\)\")_ ,\nwhich most of the animators of [Walt Disney Feature\nAnimation](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Feature_Animation \"Walt Disney Feature\nAnimation\") decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more\nprestigious and successful of the two.[15] The story artists also did not have\nmuch faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept\nthe job \"because the story wasn't very good\",[7] and writer [Burny\nMattinson](/wiki/Burny_Mattinson \"Burny Mattinson\") saying to co-worker [Joe\nRanft](/wiki/Joe_Ranft \"Joe Ranft\") \"I don't know who is going to want to\nwatch that one.\"[14][_[self-published\nsource](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_] Most of the leading animators either were doing\ntheir first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in\nanimating an animal.[8] Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in\nCalifornia and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities\nand setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for\nthe main characters included [Mark Henn](/wiki/Mark_Henn \"Mark Henn\") on young\nSimba, [Ruben A. Aquino](/wiki/Ruben_A._Aquino \"Ruben A. Aquino\") on adult\nSimba, [Andreas Deja](/wiki/Andreas_Deja \"Andreas Deja\") on Scar, Aaron Blaise\non young Nala, [Anthony DeRosa](/wiki/Anthony_DeRosa \"Anthony DeRosa\") on\nadult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa.[4] Nearly 20 minutes of the film,\nincluding the \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\" sequence,[10] were animated at\nthe [Disney-MGM Studios](/wiki/Disney%27s_Hollywood_Studios \"Disney's\nHollywood Studios\") facility. More than 600 artists, animators, and\ntechnicians contributed to _The Lion King_.[12] Weeks before the film was to\nbe released, the [1994 Northridge earthquake](/wiki/1994_Northridge_earthquake\n\"1994 Northridge earthquake\") shut down the studio and required the animators\nto finish their work from home.[23]\n\nThe character animators studied real-life animals for reference, as was done\nfor the 1942 Disney film _[Bambi](/wiki/Bambi \"Bambi\")_. [Jim\nFowler](/wiki/Jim_Fowler \"Jim Fowler\"), renowned wildlife expert, visited the\nstudios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah\ninhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings\nauthenticity.[13] The animators also studied animal movements at the [Miami\nMetroZoo](/wiki/Zoo_Miami \"Zoo Miami\") under guidance from wildlife expert\n[Ron Magill](/wiki/Ron_Magill \"Ron Magill\").[24] The Pride Lands are modeled\non the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and\nlenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in\ndocumentaries—which employ [telephoto lenses](/wiki/Telephoto_lens \"Telephoto\nlens\") to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration\nfrom concept studies by artist Hans Bacher—which, following Scribner's request\nfor realism, tried to depict effects such as [lens flare](/wiki/Lens_flare\n\"Lens flare\")—and the works of painters [Charles Marion\nRussell](/wiki/Charles_Marion_Russell \"Charles Marion Russell\"), [Frederic\nRemington](/wiki/Frederic_Remington \"Frederic Remington\") and [Maxfield\nParrish](/wiki/Maxfield_Parrish \"Maxfield Parrish\").[13][25] Art director Andy\nGaskill and the filmmakers sought to give the film a sense of grand sweep and\nepic scale similar to [David Lean](/wiki/David_Lean \"David Lean\")'s _[Lawrence\nof Arabia](/wiki/Lawrence_of_Arabia \"Lawrence of Arabia\")_. Gaskill explained:\n\"We wanted audiences to sense the vastness of the savannah and to feel the\ndust and the breeze swaying through the grass. In other words, to get a real\nsense of nature and to feel as if they were there. It's very difficult to\ncapture something as subtle as a sunrise or rain falling on a pond, but those\nare the kinds of images that we tried to get.\" The filmmakers also watched the\nfilms of [John Ford](/wiki/John_Ford \"John Ford\") and other filmmakers, which\nalso influenced the design of the film.[26]\n\nBecause the characters were not [anthropomorphized](/wiki/Anthropomorphism\n\"Anthropomorphism\"), all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged\nanimals, and the story and character development was done through use of\nlonger shots following the characters.[10]\n\n  \nComputers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways. For the\n\"wildebeest stampede\" sequence, several distinct wildebeest characters were\ncreated in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, [cel\nshaded](/wiki/Cel_shading \"Cel shading\") to look like drawn animation, and\ngiven randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable\nmovement of a herd.[27] Five specially trained animators and technicians spent\nmore than two years creating the two-and-a-half-minute stampede.[4] The\n[CAPS](/wiki/Computer_Animation_Production_System \"Computer Animation\nProduction System\") helped simulate camera movements such as [tracking\nshots](/wiki/Tracking_shot \"Tracking shot\"), and was employed in coloring,\nlighting, and particle effects.[10]\n\n## Music\n\nMain article: [The Lion King (soundtrack)](/wiki/The_Lion_King_\\(soundtrack\\)\n\"The Lion King \\(soundtrack\\)\")\n\nLyricist [Tim Rice](/wiki/Tim_Rice \"Tim Rice\"), who was working with composer\n[Alan Menken](/wiki/Alan_Menken \"Alan Menken\") on songs for\n_[Aladdin](/wiki/Aladdin_\\(1992_Disney_film\\) \"Aladdin \\(1992 Disney film\\)\")_\n, was invited to write the songs, and accepted on the condition of finding a\ncomposing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice's\nsuggestion of [Elton John](/wiki/Elton_John \"Elton John\"),[16] after Rice's\ninvitation of [ABBA](/wiki/ABBA \"ABBA\") fell through due to [Benny\nAndersson](/wiki/Benny_Andersson \"Benny Andersson\") being busy with the\nmusical _[Kristina från Duvemåla](/wiki/Kristina_fr%C3%A5n_Duvem%C3%A5la\n\"Kristina från Duvemåla\")_.[8] John expressed an interest in writing \"ultra-\npop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and see those movies and\nget just as much pleasure out of them\", mentioning a possible influence of\n_[The Jungle Book](/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_\\(1967_film\\) \"The Jungle Book \\(1967\nfilm\\)\")_ , where he felt the \"music was so funny and appealed to kids and\nadults\".[28]\n\nJohn and Rice wrote five original songs for the film (\"[Circle of\nLife](/wiki/Circle_of_Life \"Circle of Life\")\", \"[I Just Can't Wait to Be\nKing](/wiki/I_Just_Can%27t_Wait_to_Be_King \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\")\",\n\"[Be Prepared](/wiki/Be_Prepared_\\(song\\) \"Be Prepared \\(song\\)\")\", \"[Hakuna\nMatata](/wiki/Hakuna_Matata_\\(song\\) \"Hakuna Matata \\(song\\)\")\" and \"[Can You\nFeel the Love Tonight](/wiki/Can_You_Feel_the_Love_Tonight \"Can You Feel the\nLove Tonight\")\"), with John's performance of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\"\nplaying over the end credits.[29] The [IMAX](/wiki/IMAX \"IMAX\") and DVD\nreleases added another song, \"The Morning Report\", based on a song discarded\nduring development that eventually featured in the [live musical version of\n_The Lion King_](/wiki/The_Lion_King_\\(musical\\) \"The Lion King\n\\(musical\\)\").[30] The score was composed by [Hans Zimmer](/wiki/Hans_Zimmer\n\"Hans Zimmer\"), who was hired based on his work in two films in African\nsettings, _[The Power of One](/wiki/The_Power_of_One_\\(film\\) \"The Power of\nOne \\(film\\)\")_ and _[A World Apart](/wiki/A_World_Apart_\\(film\\) \"A World\nApart \\(film\\)\")_ ,[13] and supplemented the score with traditional African\nmusic and choir elements arranged by [Lebo M](/wiki/Lebo_M \"Lebo M\").[29]\nZimmer's partners [Mark Mancina](/wiki/Mark_Mancina \"Mark Mancina\") and [Jay\nRifkin](/wiki/Jay_Rifkin \"Jay Rifkin\") helped with arrangements and song\nproduction.[31]\n\nThe _Lion King_ original motion picture soundtrack was released by [Walt\nDisney Records](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Records \"Walt Disney Records\") on July 13,\n1994. It was the fourth-best-selling album of the year on the [_Billboard_\n200](/wiki/Billboard_200 \"Billboard 200\") and the top-selling soundtrack.[32]\nIt is the only soundtrack for an animated film to be [certified\nDiamond](/wiki/RIAA_certification \"RIAA certification\") (10× platinum) by the\n[Recording Industry Association of\nAmerica](/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America \"Recording Industry\nAssociation of America\"). Zimmer's complete instrumental score for the film\nwas never originally given a full release, until the soundtrack's\ncommemorative [20th anniversary re-\nrelease](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Records:_The_Legacy_Collection#The_Lion_King \"Walt\nDisney Records: The Legacy Collection\") in 2014.[33] _The Lion King_ also\ninspired the 1995 release _[Rhythm of the Pride\nLands](/wiki/Rhythm_of_the_Pride_Lands \"Rhythm of the Pride Lands\")_ , with\neight songs by Zimmer, Mancina, and Lebo M.[34]\n\nThe use of the song \"[The Lion Sleeps Tonight](/wiki/The_Lion_Sleeps_Tonight\n\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\")\" in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa led to disputes\nbetween Disney and the family of South African [Solomon\nLinda](/wiki/Solomon_Linda \"Solomon Linda\"), who composed the song (originally\ntitled \"Mbube\") in 1939. In July 2004, Linda's family filed suit, seeking $1.6\nmillion in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a\nlegal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had\nlicensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.[35]\n\n## Release\n\nFor _The Lion King_ 's first [film trailer](/wiki/Film_trailer \"Film\ntrailer\"), Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening sequence\nwith the song \"Circle of Life\". [Buena Vista Pictures\nDistribution](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_Motion_Pictures \"Walt Disney Studios\nMotion Pictures\") president [Dick Cook](/wiki/Dick_Cook \"Dick Cook\") said the\ndecision was made for such an approach because \"we were all so taken by the\nbeauty and majesty of this piece that we felt like it was probably one of the\nbest four minutes of film that we've seen\", and Don Hahn added that \"Circle of\nLife\" worked as a trailer as it \"came off so strong, and so good, and ended\nwith such a bang\". The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying\n_[The Three Musketeers](/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers_\\(1993_film\\) \"The Three\nMusketeers \\(1993 film\\)\")_ in theaters, as only a third of _The Lion King_\nhad been completed.[36][37] Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn\nto have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the\nexpectations raised by the preview.[36] Prior to the film's release, Disney\ndid 11 [test screenings](/wiki/Test_screening \"Test screening\").[38]\n\nUpon release, _The Lion King_ was accompanied by an extensive marketing\ncampaign which included tie-ins with [Burger King](/wiki/Burger_King \"Burger\nKing\"), [Mattel](/wiki/Mattel \"Mattel\"), [Kodak](/wiki/Kodak \"Kodak\"),\n[Nestlé](/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9 \"Nestlé\") and [Payless\nShoeSource](/wiki/Payless_ShoeSource \"Payless ShoeSource\"), and various\nmerchandise,[39] accounting 186 licensed products.[40][41] In 1994, Disney\nearned approximately $1 billion with products based on the film,[42] with $214\nmillion for _Lion King_ toys during Christmas 1994 alone.[43]\n\n### Home media\n\n_The Lion King_ was first released on [VHS](/wiki/VHS \"VHS\") and\n[laserdisc](/wiki/Laserdisc \"Laserdisc\") in the United States on March 3,\n1995, under [Disney](/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company \"The Walt Disney\nCompany\")'s \"[Masterpiece Collection](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Masterpiece_Collection\n\"Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection\")\" video series.

The VHS Deluxe Edition included\nthe film, an exclusive [lithograph](/wiki/Lithograph \"Lithograph\") of Rafiki\nand Simba (in some editions), a commemorative \"Circle of Life\"\n[epigraph](/wiki/Epigraph_\\(literature\\) \"Epigraph \\(literature\\)\"), six\nconcept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV show _The Making\nof The Lion King_ , and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc\nDeluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and _The\nMaking of The Lion King_ , and added storyboards, character design artwork,\nconcept art, rough animation, and a directors' commentary that the VHS edition\ndid not have, on a total of four double sided discs. The VHS tape quickly\nbecame the best-selling videotape of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on\nthe first day[45] and ultimately sales totaled more than 30 million[46] before\nthese home video versions went into\n[moratorium](/wiki/Moratorium_\\(entertainment\\) \"Moratorium\n\\(entertainment\\)\") in 1997.[47]\n\nOn October 7, 2003, the film was re-released on VHS and released on\n[DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") for the first time, titled _The Lion King: Platinum\nEdition_ , as part of Disney's [Platinum Edition](/wiki/Platinum_Edition\n\"Platinum Edition\") line of animated classic DVDs.

With the earnings of the 3D run, _The\nLion King_ surpassed all the aforementioned films but _Toy Story 3_ to rank as\nthe second-highest-grossing animated film worldwide—later downgraded to eighth\nafter _[Despicable Me 2](/wiki/Despicable_Me_2 \"Despicable Me 2\")_ , _Frozen_\n(both 2013), _[Minions](/wiki/Minions_\\(film\\) \"Minions \\(film\\)\")_ (2015),\n_Zootopia_ , _[Finding Dory](/wiki/Finding_Dory \"Finding Dory\")_ , (both\n2016), and _[Despicable Me 3](/wiki/Despicable_Me_3 \"Despicable Me 3\")_\n(2017)—and it remains the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film.[62] It is\nalso the biggest animated movie of the last 50 years in terms of estimated\nattendance.[63]\n\n#### Original theatrical run\n\n_The Lion King_ had a limited release in North America on June 15, 1994,\nplaying in only two theaters, [El Capitan Theater](/wiki/El_Capitan_Theater\n\"El Capitan Theater\") in Los Angeles and [Radio City Music\nHall](/wiki/Radio_City_Music_Hall \"Radio City Music Hall\") in New York\nCity.[64] It still earned $1,586,753 across the weekend of June 17–19,\nstanding at the tenth place of the box office ranking.[65] The average of\n$793,377 per theater stands as the largest ever achieved during a weekend.[66]\nThe wide release followed on June 24, 1994, in 2,550 screens. The digital\n[surround sound](/wiki/Surround_sound \"Surround sound\") of the film led many\nof those theaters to implement [Dolby Laboratories](/wiki/Dolby_Laboratories\n\"Dolby Laboratories\")' newest sound systems.[67] _The Lion King_ grossed $40.9\nmillion – which at the time was the fourth biggest opening weekend earning\never and the highest sum for a Disney film – to top the weekend box\noffice.[12] It also earned a rare \"A+\" rating from\n[CinemaScore](/wiki/CinemaScore \"CinemaScore\").[68] By the end of its\ntheatrical run, in spring 1995, it had earned $312,855,561,[2] being the\nsecond-highest-grossing 1994 film in North America behind _[Forrest\nGump](/wiki/Forrest_Gump \"Forrest Gump\")_.[69] Outside North America, it\nearned $455.8 million during its initial run, for a worldwide total of $768.6\nmillion.[60] [Box Office Mojo](/wiki/Box_Office_Mojo \"Box Office Mojo\")\nestimates that the film sold over 74 million tickets in the US in its initial\ntheatrical run.[70]\n\n#### Re-releases\n\n##### IMAX and large-format\n\nThe film was re-issued on December 25, 2002 for [IMAX](/wiki/IMAX \"IMAX\") and\n[large-format](/wiki/Large-format \"Large-format\") theaters. Don Hahn explained\nthat eight years after _The Lion King_ got its original release, \"there was a\nwhole new generation of kids who haven't really seen it, particularly on the\nbig screen.\" Given the film had already been digitally archived during\nproduction, the restoration process was easier, while also providing many\nscenes with enhancements that covered up original deficiencies.[38][71] An\nenhanced sound mix was also provided to, as Hahn explained, \"make the audience\nfeel like they're in the middle of the movie.\"[38] On its first weekend, _The\nLion King_ made $2.7 million from 66 locations, a $27,664 per theater average.\nThis run ended with $15,686,215 on May 30, 2003.[72]\n\n##### 3D conversion\n\nIn 2011, _The Lion King_ was converted to [3D](/wiki/3D_film \"3D film\") for a\ntwo-week limited theatrical re-issue and subsequent 3D [Blu-ray](/wiki/Blu-\nray_Disc \"Blu-ray Disc\") release.[51][73] The film opened at the number one\nspot on Friday, September 16, 2011 with $8.9 million[74] and finished the\nweekend with $30.2 million, ranking number one at the box office. This made\n_The Lion King_ the first re-issue release to earn the number-one slot at the\nAmerican weekend box office since the re-issue of _[Return of the\nJedi](/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi \"Return of the Jedi\")_ in March 1997.[62] The\nfilm also achieved the fourth-highest September opening weekend of all\ntime.[75] It held off very well on its second weekend, again earning first\nplace at the box office with a 27 percent decline to $21.9 million.[76] Most\nbox-office observers had expected the film to fall about 50 percent in its\nsecond weekend and were also expecting _[Moneyball](/wiki/Moneyball_\\(film\\)\n\"Moneyball \\(film\\)\")_ to be at first place.[77]\n\nAfter its initial box-office success, many theaters decided to continue to\nshow the film for more than two weeks, even though its 3D Blu-ray release was\nscheduled for two-and-a-half weeks after its theatrical release.[76] In North\nAmerica, the 3D re-release ended its run in theaters on January 12, 2012 with\na gross $94,242,001. Outside North America, it earned $83,400,000.[78] The\nsuccessful 3D re-release of _The Lion King_ made Disney and\n[Pixar](/wiki/Pixar \"Pixar\") plan 3D theatrical re-releases of _[Beauty and\nthe Beast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast\n\\(1991 film\\)\")_ , _[Finding Nemo](/wiki/Finding_Nemo \"Finding Nemo\")_ ,\n_[Monsters, Inc.](/wiki/Monsters,_Inc. \"Monsters, Inc.\")_ , and _[The Little\nMermaid](/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_\\(1989_film\\) \"The Little Mermaid \\(1989\nfilm\\)\")_ during 2012 and 2013.[79] However, none of the re-releases of the\nfirst three films achieved the enormous success of _The Lion King 3D_ and\ntheatrical re-release of _The Little Mermaid_ was ultimately cancelled.[80] In\n2012, Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version\nof _The Lion King_ succeeded was because, \"the notion of a 3D re-release was\nstill fresh and exciting, and _The Lion King (3D)_ felt timely given the\nmovie's imminent Blu-ray release. Audiences have been hit with three 3D re-\nreleases in the year since, meaning the novelty value has definitely worn\noff.\"[81]\n\n### Critical response\n\n_The Lion King_ was released to critical acclaim. On [Rotten\nTomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\"), the film holds a rating of\n93%, based on 122 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4 out of 10. It also\nranked 56th on their \"Top 100 Animation Movies\".[82] The site's critical\nconsensus reads, \"Emotionally stirring, richly drawn, and beautifully\nanimated, _The Lion King_ stands tall within Disney's pantheon of classic\nfamily films.\"[83] On [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\"), the film\nhas a score of 83 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"universal\nacclaim\".[84] [CinemaScore](/wiki/CinemaScore \"CinemaScore\") reported that\naudiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade.[85]\n\n[Roger Ebert](/wiki/Roger_Ebert \"Roger Ebert\") gave it 3 1/2 out of 4-stars\nand called the film \"a superbly drawn animated feature\" and, in his print\nreview wrote, \"The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes\nsomething to Greek tragedy and certainly to _Hamlet_ , is a learning\nexperience as well as an entertainment.\"[86] On the television program\n_[Siskel& Ebert](/wiki/At_the_Movies_\\(U.S._TV_series\\) \"At the Movies \\(U.S.\nTV series\\)\")_, the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when\ncompared to previous Disney films. Ebert and his partner [Gene\nSiskel](/wiki/Gene_Siskel \"Gene Siskel\") both gave the film a \"Thumbs Up\" but\nSiskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ and was \"a good film, not a great one\".[87] Hal Hinson of _[The\nWashington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The Washington Post\")_ called it\n\"an impressive, almost daunting achievement\" and felt that the film was\n\"spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney's\nfeature-length animations\", but was less enthusiastic toward the end of his\nreview saying, \"Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more\nappropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it\nis downright strange.\"[88]\n\n[Owen Gleiberman](/wiki/Owen_Gleiberman \"Owen Gleiberman\") of _[Entertainment\nWeekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment Weekly\")_ praised the film,\nwriting that it \"has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but\nas an emotionally pungent movie\".[89] _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone\n\"Rolling Stone\")_ film critic [Peter Travers](/wiki/Peter_Travers \"Peter\nTravers\") praised the film and felt that it was \"a hugely entertaining blend\nof music, fun and eye-popping thrills, though it doesn't lack for heart\".[90]\n[James Berardinelli](/wiki/James_Berardinelli \"James Berardinelli\") from\nReelViews praised the film saying, \"With each new animated release, Disney\nseems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more. _The Lion\nKing_ is the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there\nclearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children.\nHappily, for those of us who generally stay far away from 'cartoons', they\nhave succeeded.\"[91]\n\nSome reviewers still had problems with the film's narrative. The staff of _[TV\nGuide](/wiki/TV_Guide \"TV Guide\")_ wrote that while _The Lion King_ was\ntechnically proficient and entertaining, it \"offers a less memorable song\nscore than did the previous hits, and a hasty, unsatisfying dramatic\nresolution.\"[92] _[The New Yorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker \"The New Yorker\")_ 's\nTerrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation, the story felt\nlike \"manipulat[ing] our responses at will\", as \"Between traumas, the movie\nserves up soothingly banal musical numbers and silly, rambunctious\ncomedy\".[93]\n\n### Accolades\n\n_The Lion King_ received four [Golden Globe](/wiki/Golden_Globe \"Golden\nGlobe\") and [Academy Award](/wiki/Academy_Award \"Academy Award\") nominations.\nThe film would go on to win two Golden Globes; for [Best Motion Picture –\nMusical or\nComedy](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Motion_Picture_%E2%80%93_Musical_or_Comedy\n\"Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\") and [Best\nOriginal Score](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Original_Score \"Golden Globe\nAward for Best Original Score\"),[94] as well as two Academy Awards, for [Best\nOriginal Score](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score \"Academy Award for\nBest Original Score\") ([Hans Zimmer](/wiki/Hans_Zimmer \"Hans Zimmer\")) and\n[Best Original Song](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Song \"Academy Award\nfor Best Original Song\") with \"[Can You Feel the Love\nTonight](/wiki/Can_You_Feel_the_Love_Tonight \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\")\"\nby [Elton John](/wiki/Elton_John \"Elton John\") and [Tim Rice](/wiki/Tim_Rice\n\"Tim Rice\").[95] The songs \"[Circle of Life](/wiki/Circle_of_Life \"Circle of\nLife\")\" and \"[Hakuna Matata](/wiki/Hakuna_Matata_\\(song\\) \"Hakuna Matata\n\\(song\\)\")\" were also nominated.[95] \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" also won\nthe [Grammy Award](/wiki/Grammy_Award \"Grammy Award\") for Best Male Vocal\nPerformance.[96] _The Lion King_ also won [Annie Awards](/wiki/Annie_Award\n\"Annie Award\") for [Best Animated\nFeature](/wiki/Annie_Award_for_Best_Animated_Feature \"Annie Award for Best\nAnimated Feature\"), Best Achievement in Voice Acting (for [Jeremy\nIrons](/wiki/Jeremy_Irons \"Jeremy Irons\")) and Best Individual Achievement for\nStory Contribution in the Field of Animation.[97]\n\nAt the [Saturn Awards](/wiki/Saturn_Awards \"Saturn Awards\"), the film was\nnominated in two categories, Best Fantasy Film and Best Performance by a\nYounger Actor although it did not win in either category.[98] The film also\nreceived two nominations at the [British Academy Film\nAwards](/wiki/British_Academy_Film_Awards \"British Academy Film Awards\"), for\nBest Sound as well as the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music although it\nlost in both categories to _[Speed](/wiki/Speed_\\(1994_film\\) \"Speed \\(1994\nfilm\\)\")_ and _[Backbeat](/wiki/Backbeat_\\(film\\) \"Backbeat \\(film\\)\")_\nrespectively.[99] The film received two [BMI Film & TV\nAwards](/wiki/Broadcast_Music_Incorporated \"Broadcast Music Incorporated\") for\nFilm Music and Most Performed Song with \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\"[100]\nAt the [1995 MTV Movie Awards](/wiki/1995_MTV_Movie_Awards \"1995 MTV Movie\nAwards\"), the film received nominations for Best Villain and Best Song, though\nit lost in both categories.[101] _The Lion King_ won the Kids' Choice Award\nfor Favorite Movie at the [1995 Kids' Choice\nAwards](/wiki/1995_Kids%27_Choice_Awards \"1995 Kids' Choice Awards\").[102]\n\nIn 2008, _The Lion King_ was ranked as the 319th greatest film ever made by\n_[Empire](/wiki/Empire_\\(magazine\\) \"Empire \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine,[103] and\nin June 2011, [_TIME_](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\") named it\none of \"The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films\".[104] In June 2008, the [American\nFilm Institute](/wiki/American_Film_Institute \"American Film Institute\")\nlisted _The Lion King_ as the fourth best film in the animation genre in its\n[AFI's 10 Top 10](/wiki/AFI%27s_10_Top_10 \"AFI's 10 Top 10\") list,[105] having\npreviously put \"Hakuna Matata\" as 99th on its [AFI's 100 Years...100\nSongs](/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Songs \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs\")\nranking.[106]\n\nIn 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [National\nFilm Registry](/wiki/National_Film_Registry \"National Film Registry\") by the\n[Library of Congress](/wiki/Library_of_Congress \"Library of Congress\") as\nbeing \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n### Controversies\n\nCertain elements of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s\nJapanese [anime](/wiki/Anime \"Anime\") television series, _[Jungle\nEmperor](/wiki/Kimba_the_White_Lion \"Kimba the White Lion\")_ (known as _Kimba\nthe White Lion_ in the United States), with characters having similar\nanalogues, and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the\nshow. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an\nAmerican version of _Kimba_ since he was familiar with the Japanese\noriginal.[107] _The Lion King_ director Roger Allers claimed complete\nunfamiliarity with the show until the movie was almost completed, and did not\nremember it being ever mentioned during development.[108] Co-director Rob\nMinkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it.[109][110] Minkoff also\nobserved that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is \"not unusual to have\ncharacters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas.\"[109] Yoshihiro Shimizu, of\n[Tezuka Productions](/wiki/Tezuka_Productions \"Tezuka Productions\"), which\ncreated _Kimba the White Lion_ , has refuted rumors that the studio was paid\nhush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the\nindustry to sue because, \"we're a small, weak company. It wouldn't be worth it\nanyway ... Disney's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!\"[111] [Fred\nLadd](/wiki/Fred_Ladd \"Fred Ladd\"), who was involved early on with importing\n_Kimba_ and other Japanese into America for NBC, expressed incredulity that\nDisney's people could remain ignorant.[112][110] Ladd stated there was at\nleast one animator remembered by his colleagues as being an avid _Kimba_ fan\nand being quite vociferous about Disney's conduct during production.[112]\nAnimators [Tom Sito](/wiki/Tom_Sito \"Tom Sito\") and Mark Kausler who both have\nstory credits have both admitted to watching _Kimba_ , and assumed many of\ntheir colleagues had too, especially if they grew up in the 60s. But Sito\ninsisted there was no conscious effort to derive work from _Kimba_ , and\nKausler emphasized Disney's own _Bambi_ as being their model during\ndevelopment.[113][114]\n\n[![Simba lays down on a cliff, while the airborne dust next to him resembles\nthe shape\n\"SFX\".](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/Lionkg2.jpg/220px-\nLionkg2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lionkg2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Lionkg2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe alleged \"SEX\" frame.\n\nProtests were raised against one scene where it appears as if the word \"SEX\"\nmight have been embedded into the dust flying in the sky when Simba flops\ndown,[115] which conservative activist [Donald Wildmon](/wiki/Donald_Wildmon\n\"Donald Wildmon\") asserted was a [subliminal message](/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli\n\"Subliminal stimuli\") intended to promote [sexual\npromiscuity](/wiki/Sexual_promiscuity \"Sexual promiscuity\"). Animator Tom Sito\nhas stated that the letters spell \"SFX\" (a common abbreviation for \"[special\neffects](/wiki/Special_effect \"Special effect\")\"), not with an \"E\" instead of\nthe \"F\", and were intended as an innocent \"signature\" created by the effects\nanimation team.[116]\n\nHyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena\nresearcher sued Disney studios for [defamation of\ncharacter](/wiki/Defamation_of_character \"Defamation of character\"),[117] and\nanother—who had organized the animators' visit to the [University of\nCalifornia](/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley \"University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley\")'s Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they\nwould observe and sketch captive hyenas—[118] included\n[boycotting](/wiki/Boycott \"Boycott\") _The Lion King_ among the ways it would\nhelp preserve hyenas in the wild.[119] The hyenas have also been interpreted\nto represent an anti-immigrant allegory, where the hyenas would be black and\nLatino ethnic communities.[120][121][122][123] The film has also been\ncriticised for advancing a [fascist](/wiki/Fascist \"Fascist\") narrative in its\nportrayal of the lion kingdom and the circle of life where \"only the strong\nand the beautiful triumph, and the powerless survive only by serving the\nstrong.\"[124]\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Sequels and spin-offs\n\nThe first _Lion King_ -related animated projects involved the characters of\nTimon and Pumbaa. First, the duo starred in the animated short \"Stand by Me\",\nfeaturing Timon singing [the eponymous\nsong](/wiki/Stand_by_Me_\\(Ben_E._King_song\\) \"Stand by Me \\(Ben E. King\nsong\\)\"), which was released in 1995 accompanying the theatrical release of\n_[Tom and Huck](/wiki/Tom_and_Huck \"Tom and Huck\")_. The duo then received\ntheir own animated series, _[The Lion King's Timon and\nPumbaa](/wiki/Timon_%26_Pumbaa_\\(TV_series\\) \"Timon & Pumbaa \\(TV series\\)\")_,\nwhich ran for three seasons and 85 episodes between 1995 and 1999. Ernie\nSabella continued to voice Pumbaa, while Timon was voiced by [Quinton\nFlynn](/wiki/Quinton_Flynn \"Quinton Flynn\") and [Kevin\nSchon](/wiki/Kevin_Schon \"Kevin Schon\") in addition to Nathan Lane.[125]\n\nDisney released two direct-to-video films related to _The Lion King_. The\nfirst was sequel _[The Lion King II: Simba's\nPride](/wiki/The_Lion_King_II:_Simba%27s_Pride \"The Lion King II: Simba's\nPride\")_, released in 1998 on VHS. The film centers around Simba and Nala's\ndaughter, Kiara, who falls in love with Kovu, a male lion who was raised in a\npride of Scar's followers, the Outsiders.[126] 2004 saw the release of another\n_Lion King_ film on DVD, _[The Lion King 1½](/wiki/The_Lion_King_1%C2%BD \"The\nLion King 1½\")_. It is a prequel in showing how Timon and Pumbaa met each\nother, and also a [parallel](/wiki/Sequel#Parallel \"Sequel\") in that it also\ndepicts what the characters were [retconned](/wiki/Retconned \"Retconned\") to\nhave done during the events of the original movie.[127]\n\nIn June 2014, it was announced that a new TV series based on the film would be\nreleased called _[The Lion Guard](/wiki/The_Lion_Guard \"The Lion Guard\")_ ,\nfeaturing Kion, the second-born cub of Simba and Nala. _The Lion Guard_ is a\nsequel to _The Lion King_ and takes place during the time-gap within _The Lion\nKing II: Simba 's Pride._[128] It was first broadcast on [Disney\nChannel](/wiki/Disney_Channel \"Disney Channel\") as a television film titled\n_The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar_ in
