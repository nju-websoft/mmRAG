In the video, a\nrock band similar to [the Beatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The Beatles\") (played by\nthe members of Imagine Dragons) pretend to be astronauts for the faked moon\nlanding. The taping goes awry as fans of the band stream into the sound stage\nand turn the event into a rock concert, much to the chagrin of Kubrick and\nPresident [Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\"), who is also on\nhand; the crowd might be discovering by being there, that the landings were\nfake or just be happy to be at the concert. The people at home might be\nagreeing now that the conspiracies were real, though just how many people are\naware or not is not exactly shown.[11] The video also briefly references\nanother popular conspiracy theory from around the same time, that Beatles\nmember [Paul McCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\") [died in\n1966](/wiki/Paul_is_dead \"Paul is dead\") and was replaced by a [look-\nalike](/wiki/Look-alike \"Look-alike\").[11]\n\nThe video was filmed in [Provo, Utah](/wiki/Provo,_Utah \"Provo, Utah\"),\nImagine Dragons' original hometown, and includes cameos from various\ncelebrities associated with Provo or [Brigham Young\nUniversity](/wiki/Brigham_Young_University \"Brigham Young University\"),\nincluding [Jon Heder](/wiki/Jon_Heder \"Jon Heder\"), the cast of the TV show\n_[Studio C](/wiki/Studio_C \"Studio C\")_ , guitarist [Robbie\nConnolly](/wiki/Fictionist \"Fictionist\"), and members of [The New Electric\nSound](/wiki/The_New_Electric_Sound \"The New Electric Sound\").
