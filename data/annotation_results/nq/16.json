Qui-Gon helps\nAnakin win his freedom, but cannot get Shmi out of slavery. She allows Anakin\nto leave with Qui-Gon, assuring her heartbroken son that they will meet again.\n\nIn _Attack of the Clones_ , Anakin ([Hayden\nChristensen](/wiki/Hayden_Christensen \"Hayden Christensen\")), now a young\nadult [Jedi](/wiki/Jedi \"Jedi\") apprentice, senses through the\n[Force](/wiki/Force_\\(Star_Wars\\) \"Force \\(Star Wars\\)\") that she is in pain.\nHe travels to Tatooine to find her, and, upon arriving, learns that she had\nbeen freed by and married to moisture farmer [Cliegg\nLars](/wiki/Minor_residents_of_Tatooine#Lars,_Cliegg \"Minor residents of\nTatooine\") ([Jack Thompson](/wiki/Jack_Thompson_\\(actor\\) \"Jack Thompson\n\\(actor\\)\")), but had recently been abducted by [Tusken\nRaiders](/wiki/Tusken_Raiders \"Tusken Raiders\"). He finds her inside one of\ntheir encampments, but it's too late—beaten and [tortured](/wiki/Torture\n\"Torture\") beyond help, she dies in his arms. Heartbroken and enraged, Anakin\nslaughters every single Tusken in the camp, including the women and children.\nHis mother's death ignites a strong anger in Anakin, and sets him on the path\nto becoming [Darth Vader](/wiki/Darth_Vader \"Darth Vader\").\n\n### Anakin Skywalker (Darth\nVader)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Skywalker_family&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Anakin Skywalker \\(Darth Vader\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Darth Vader](/wiki/Darth_Vader \"Darth Vader\")\n\nAnakin Skywalker is the son of Shmi Skywalker and no father, due to being\nconceived through the force.

After the death of Qui-Gon, he becomes the\n[Padawan](/wiki/Jedi#Padawan \"Jedi\") of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He also forms a close\nbond with [Padmé Amidala](/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala \"Padmé Amidala\"), the young\nsenator of [Naboo](/wiki/Naboo \"Naboo\"). The newly elected Chancellor of the\nGalactic Republic, Palpatine, also befriends Anakin, promising to watch the\nboy's progress \"with great interest\" and advise him. Torn between his loyalty\nto the Jedi and his drive for power, Anakin succumbs to temptation and becomes\nDarth Vader.\n\n### Padmé\nAmidala[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Skywalker_family&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Padmé Amidala\")]\n\nMain article: [Padmé Amidala](/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala \"Padmé Amidala\")\n\nThe secret wife of Anakin Skywalker, and mother of Luke and Leia and maternal\ngrandmother of Kylo Ren.

He is taken in by\nhis uncle and aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, after the death of Padmé and Anakin's\nfall to the dark side. He is force sensitive and skilled with a lightsaber. In\n_Return of the Jedi_ , a dying Yoda confirms to Luke, that Darth Vader\n(previously Anakin Skywalker) is actually his father, despite Luke's belief\nthat Vader's claim to fatherhood in _The Empire Strikes Back_ was a ruse to\npull Luke to the dark side. He also finds out from Obi-Wan's [force\nghost](/wiki/Force_ghost \"Force ghost\") that Princess Leia Organa is his\nsister. In _The Force Awakens_ , as the last known Jedi, Luke is in hiding\nafter failing to prevent his nephew Ben (now Kylo Ren) from turning to the\ndark side to join [Supreme Leader Snoke](/wiki/Supreme_Leader_Snoke \"Supreme\nLeader Snoke\").\n\n### Leia\nOrgana[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Skywalker_family&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Leia Organa\")]\n\nMain article: [Princess Leia](/wiki/Princess_Leia \"Princess Leia\")\n\nThe daughter of [Anakin Skywalker](/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker \"Anakin Skywalker\")\nand [Padmé Amidala](/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala \"Padmé Amidala\"), [Leia\nOrgana](/wiki/Princess_Leia \"Princess Leia\") was adopted by Bail and Breha\nOrgana of Alderaan.

In _[Return of the Jedi](/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi \"Return of\nthe Jedi\")_ , planning to feed Luke, Han, and [Chewbacca](/wiki/Chewbacca\n\"Chewbacca\") to the flesh eating [Sarlacc](/wiki/Sarlacc \"Sarlacc\"), [Jabba\nthe Hutt](/wiki/Jabba_the_Hutt \"Jabba the Hutt\") is instead strangled to death\nby Leia by a chain he has on her. She later becomes involved in the Battle of\nEndor. In the years that follow, she becomes General Organa, the leader of the\nResistance, a military organization unofficially backed by the New Republic to\ncounter the First Order. She married Han Solo and had a son named [Ben\nSolo](/wiki/Ben_Solo \"Ben Solo\"), later Kylo Ren, whose turning to the dark\nside separated the couple before the events of _The Force Awakens_.
