It is a registered professional\nbody under the National Qualifications Framework Act, 2008. The Institute is a\nprofessional association of tax professionals regulating tax practitioners in\nSouth Africa. SAIT promotes and focuses on the public interest, professional\nstandards, ethics and integrity, albeit promoting the tax industry and its\nmembers.[1]\n\n## Formation and\nactivities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=South_African_Institute_of_Tax_Practitioners&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Formation and activities\")]\n\nSAIT is a Not for Profit professional body incorporated in 2007 by a group of\ntax professionals and educators. The SAIT is governed by a Constitution, with\na Board elected by members.\n\nWhen SAIT was formed in 2007 by its main founder Stiaan Klue, the Institute\nannounced that one member of the Board may be nominated by the [South African\nRevenue Service](/wiki/South_African_Revenue_Service \"South African Revenue\nService\") (SARS). SARS said they agreed in principle with the general\nobjectives of SAIT.[2]\n\nIn 2014 SAICA joined SAIT and other SARS recognised controlling bodies to host\nthe Tax Indaba - SAIT is the founder of the Tax Indaba in South Africa.[3]\n\nOther organisations representing tax professionals in the country are the\n[South African Institute of Chartered\nAccountants](/wiki/South_African_Institute_of_Chartered_Accountants \"South\nAfrican Institute of Chartered Accountants\") (SAICA) and the [South African\nInstitute of Professional\nAccountants](/wiki/South_African_Institute_of_Professional_Accountants \"South\nAfrican Institute of Professional Accountants\") (SAIPA).[4]\n\nIn March 2011 the CEO of the Institute, Stiaan Klue, joined with Nicolaas van\nWyk of the [Association of Chartered Certified\nAccountants](/wiki/Association_of_Chartered_Certified_Accountants \"Association\nof Chartered Certified Accountants\") in calling for simplification of South\nAfrican tax laws, pointing out that many businesses remained in the [informal\nsector](/wiki/Informal_sector \"Informal sector\") due to the cost and\ndifficulty of registration.[5] SAIT publishes TaxTalk every two months to\n10,200 recipients. The magazine deals with tax issues for the South African\nmarket.[6]\n\nIn 2014, in comparison to the global average top rate of 32%, South Africa’s\ntop personal income tax rate of 40% was high, and in comparison to the global\naverage corporate tax rate of 24%, South Africa's was 28%. According to SAIT,\nthat suggested that South Africa’s tax burden is high compared to other\njurisdictions. Because it was important for South Africa to be competitive, in\norder to encourage economic growth, SAIT recommended to\n[Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_South_Africa \"Parliament of South Africa\")\nthat they reduce the corporate tax rate to bolster foreign direct investment,\ninfrastructure development and growth.[7]\n\n##\nMembership[[edit](/w/index.php?title=South_African_Institute_of_Tax_Practitioners&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Membership\")]\n\nSAIT members in good standing have reciprocal benefits of several other\ninternational tax institutes, including the [Canadian Tax\nFoundation](/wiki/Canadian_Tax_Foundation \"Canadian Tax Foundation\"),\n[Chartered Institute of Taxation](/wiki/Chartered_Institute_of_Taxation\n\"Chartered Institute of Taxation\") (UK), [Taxation Institute of\nAustralia](/wiki/Taxation_Institute_of_Australia \"Taxation Institute of\nAustralia\"), [Irish Tax\nInstitute](/w/index.php?title=Irish_Tax_Institute&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Irish\nTax Institute \\(page does not exist\\)\"), [Chartered Institute of Taxation of\nNigeria](/wiki/Chartered_Institute_of_Taxation_of_Nigeria \"Chartered Institute\nof Taxation of Nigeria\"), [Chamber of Tax Advisers of the Czech\nRepublic](/wiki/Chamber_of_Tax_Advisers_of_the_Czech_Republic \"Chamber of Tax\nAdvisers of the Czech Republic\") and the [Dutch Association of Tax Advisors\n(NOB)](/w/index.php?title=Dutch_Association_of_Tax_Advisors_\\(NOB\\)&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Dutch Association of Tax Advisors \\(NOB\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\").[8] SAIT\nis a member of the [International Tax Directors\nForum](/w/index.php?title=International_Tax_Directors_Forum&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"International Tax Directors Forum \\(page does not exist\\)\") (ITDF).[1]\n\nSAIT has been collaborating and exchanging information with African Tax\nprofessional bodies[Chartered Institute of Taxation of\nNigeria](/wiki/Chartered_Institute_of_Taxation_of_Nigeria \"Chartered Institute\nof Taxation of Nigeria\") since 2007.[9] During 2010 the SAIT Chief Executive,\nStiaan Klue, initiated the establishment of a Pan-African body for tax\nassociations. In June 2011 SAIT participated in a meeting in\n[Lagos](/wiki/Lagos \"Lagos\"), Nigeria in which it was agreed to establish the\n[Association of African Tax\nInstitutes](/wiki/Association_of_African_Tax_Institutes \"Association of\nAfrican Tax Institutes\") (AATI). The SAIT CE is a vice president of AATI.[10]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=South_African_Institute_of_Tax_Practitioners&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [\"RE: CLARIFICATION: SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF TAX PRACTITIONERS (SAIT)\"](http://www.etax.co.za/docs/Clarification_SAIT_Profession.pdf) (PDF).
