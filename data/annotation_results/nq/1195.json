It had its\nfirst broadcast on the [ITV](/wiki/ITV_\\(TV_network\\) \"ITV \\(TV network\\)\")\nnetwork in Great Britain in 1984. It is based on _[The Railway\nSeries](/wiki/The_Railway_Series \"The Railway Series\")_ of books by the\nReverend [Wilbert Awdry](/wiki/Wilbert_Awdry \"Wilbert Awdry\") and his son,\n[Christopher Awdry](/wiki/Christopher_Awdry \"Christopher Awdry\").\n\nThese books follow the adventures of a group of\n[anthropomorphised](/wiki/Anthropomorphism \"Anthropomorphism\")\n[locomotives](/wiki/Locomotive \"Locomotive\") and [road\nvehicles](/wiki/Road_vehicle \"Road vehicle\") who live on the fictional [Island\nof Sodor](/wiki/Sodor_\\(fictional_island\\) \"Sodor \\(fictional island\\)\"). The\nbooks were based on stories Wilbert told to entertain his son, Christopher,\nduring his recovery from [measles](/wiki/Measles \"Measles\"). Many of the\nstories from the first four series are based on events from Awdry's personal\nexperience.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Precursors\n    * 1.2 _Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends_ and its success\n    * 1.3 _Thomas & Friends_ and its recent developments\n  * 2 Cast\n  * 3 List of productions\n    * 3.1 Television series\n    * 3.2 Films, specials, and miniseries\n    * 3.3 Home video history\n  * 4 Production\n    * 4.1 Characters\n    * 4.2 Storytelling\n    * 4.3 Models\n    * 4.4 Face movements\n    * 4.5 Music\n    * 4.6 Head writer\n  * 5 Broadcast\n  * 6 Reception\n    * 6.1 Critical response\n    * 6.2 Internet popularity\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n    * 8.1 Official websites\n    * 8.2 Other sites\n\n## History\n\n### Precursors\n\nBefore the airing of the first episode of _Thomas & Friends_ in 1984, previous\nattempts had been made to adapt Awdry's stories for television, but not all\nattempts were successful.[3] The first was in 1953, when the editor of the\n_Railway Series_ books, Eric Marriott, was approached by the BBC, who wished\nto use live-action model trains to re-create two stories from Awdry's first\nbook, _[The Three Railway Engines](/wiki/The_Three_Railway_Engines \"The Three\nRailway Engines\")_.[3]\n\nThe engines were portrayed by [00 gauge](/wiki/00_gauge \"00 gauge\") [Hornby\nDublo](/wiki/Hornby_Dublo \"Hornby Dublo\") models and driven on authentic sets\nin the style of the original illustrations. The first episode, based on \"The\nSad Story of Henry\", was broadcast live on the evening of Sunday 14 June 1953\nfrom [Lime Grove Studios](/wiki/Lime_Grove_Studios \"Lime Grove\nStudios\").[3][4][5] The live broadcast did not fare well. Reportedly, a\nfailure to switch the points caused the model of\n[Henry](/wiki/Henry_the_Green_Engine \"Henry the Green Engine\") to derail and\nviewers of the live broadcast witnessed a human hand, said to be the one of a\ncrew member, picking him up and placing him back on the rails. Models moved\njerkily, and all effects and music had to be superimposed.[3][4][5]\n\nBy 23 June, news of the broadcast hit the front pages of the _[Daily\nTelegraph](/wiki/Daily_Telegraph \"Daily Telegraph\")_ and the _[Daily\nMail](/wiki/Daily_Mail \"Daily Mail\")_. Awdry himself branded the episode as\n\"unprofessional\", and the point-switching debacle as an \"elementary\nmistake\".[3][4][5] As a result, the second episode scheduled for 28 June 1953\nwas put on hold, and then later cancelled.[3][4][5] After the \"Sad Story of\nHenry\" fiasco, the BBC did attempt to rescue the project by offering to give\nAwdry and the _Railway Series_ publishers greater creative control over the\nproduction of the episodes, but the publishers declined the offer, preferring\nto focus on publishing new books for the series.[3]\n\nNearly twenty years later, the BBC incorporated Awdry's stories once again.\nFourteen years before _Thomas and Friends_ was aired, [Ted\nRay](/wiki/Ted_Ray_\\(comedian\\) \"Ted Ray \\(comedian\\)\"), sitting in a\n[stationmaster](/wiki/Stationmaster \"Stationmaster\")'s office, read out five\n_Railway Series_ books between 20 September to 2 October 1970 on the popular\ntelevision story-telling show _[Jackanory](/wiki/Jackanory\n\"Jackanory\")_.[3][6]\n\n### _Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends_ and its success\n\nIn 1979, British television producer [Britt Allcroft](/wiki/Britt_Allcroft\n\"Britt Allcroft\") was producing a [documentary](/wiki/Documentary\n\"Documentary\") on the [Bluebell Railway](/wiki/Bluebell_Railway \"Bluebell\nRailway\"),[3][4] a [heritage railway](/wiki/Heritage_railway \"Heritage\nrailway\") in [Sussex](/wiki/Sussex \"Sussex\") which actually featured in the\n_Railway Series_ book _[Stepney the _Bluebell_\nEngine](/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_books#Stepney_the_.27.27Bluebell.27.27_Engine\n\"List of Railway Series books\")_.[7] As part of her research before filming,\nAllcroft read some books in _The Railway Series_ and was highly entertained\nand impressed with the stories which Awdry had written, later remarking that\n\"there was something in the stories that I felt I could develop that would\nconnect with children. I saw a strong emotional content that would carry with\nlittle children's experiences with life.\"[4]\n\nAllcroft worked to convince Awdry that she could, with funding, convert the\nstories into a successful television show. Her efforts were successful, and\nshe purchased the television rights from the publishers of _The Railway\nSeries_ at a cost of what was then £50,000 ($74,000 in U.S. dollars at the\ntime).[3][4] Allcroft still had to work to raise the money to finance\nproduction and, despite showing a keen interest, wanted a level of creative\ncontrol which she did not want to forego. In the end, after several years of\nsearching and having to place a second mortgage on her home, Allcroft raised\nsufficient funding from her local bank manager.[3][4][8][9]\n\nBy 1981, Allcroft had secured the finances to produce the show, she started to\nassemble the crew, including producer and director [David\nMitton](/wiki/David_Mitton \"David Mitton\"), also the founder of Clearwater\nFeatures Ltd.; crew member Steve Asquith; American-born producer [Robert D.\nCardona](/wiki/Robert_D._Cardona \"Robert D. Cardona\"); and the selected team\nof composers and songwriters Mike O'Donnell and [Junior\nCampbell](/wiki/Junior_Campbell \"Junior Campbell\").\n\nThe series started production in 1984 by Allcroft's production company, The\nBritt Allcroft Company; [Clearwater Features](/wiki/Clearwater_Features\n\"Clearwater Features\") Ltd. (Mitton and Cardona's company); and the\n[ITV](/wiki/ITV_\\(TV_network\\) \"ITV \\(TV network\\)\") company [Central\nIndependent Television](/wiki/Central_Independent_Television \"Central\nIndependent Television\").[10] The series was originally shot and produced with\nlive action models at the Clearwater in house studio in Battersea, a suburb of\nLondon, for Series 1. It later relocated to [Shepperton\nStudios](/wiki/Shepperton_Studios \"Shepperton Studios\"), Middlesex, southwest\nof London for subsequent series. The use of moving models was seen at the time\nof the series' conception as an effective method of animating the stories.\nLocomotives and other vehicles were operated by radio, while humans and\nanimals were static figures. [Stop-motion](/wiki/Stop-motion \"Stop-motion\")\nwas occasionally employed for instances in which a human or animal character\nwould move. Hand-drawn animation was used in Series 3 to create bees.\n\nThe first series (1984) used stories from the first eight books, along with\none specially written by the [Rev. W. Awdry](/wiki/Wilbert_Vere_Awdry \"Wilbert\nVere Awdry\"), _Thomas 's Christmas Party_. The second series (1986) used\nstories from Book 9 ([_Edward the Blue\nEngine_](/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#Edward_the_Blue_Engine \"List of\nRailway Series Books\")) to Book 30 ([_More About Thomas the Tank\nEngine_](/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#More_About_Thomas_the_Tank_Engine\n\"List of Railway Series Books\")). This book was unusual, as it was written\nspecifically by [Christopher Awdry](/wiki/Christopher_Awdry \"Christopher\nAwdry\") to be adapted by the show. At that time, it was a contractual\nobligation that the series could only adapt stories that appeared in print.\nThe series also used a story from a Thomas Annual, \"Thomas and Trevor\", and a\nspecially written stand-alone story, [_Thomas and the Missing Christmas\nTree_](/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#Thomas_and_the_Missing_Christmas_Tree\n\"List of Railway Series Books\"). The second series was actually a 27-episode\nseries, as a single (unaired) episode (\"[The Missing\nCoach](/wiki/The_Missing_Coach \"The Missing Coach\")\") was in the process of\nbeing filmed, but despite being filmed it was never shown because Allcroft\ndecided it was too confusing for young viewers. The production team went on to\nuse \"Thomas, Percy and the Coal\" instead.[11]\n\nIn between production of the second and third series, the production team were\nfocused in producing two other television series:\n_[Tugs](/wiki/Tugs_\\(TV_series\\) \"Tugs \\(TV series\\)\")_ , which ran for one\nseries from 1988 to 1990 for [Television South](/wiki/Television_South\n\"Television South\") (TVS);[12] and the American television series _[Shining\nTime Station](/wiki/Shining_Time_Station \"Shining Time Station\")_ , which\nrepackaged _Thomas & Friends_ for the American television market from 1989 to\n1995.\n\nJust before production of series three, Clearwater closed on 31 December 1990,\nwith The Britt Allcroft Company becoming the sole producer. Series three was\nbroadcast in 1991 for [Thames Television](/wiki/Thames_Television \"Thames\nTelevision\"). It was made at a cost of £1.3 million (approximately\n$9.3.million in U.S. dollars at the time).[13][_[verification\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_] The series\nwas a combination of episodes derived from _The Railway Series_ , stories in\nthe _Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends_ magazine (written by the series'\ncurrent head writer, Andrew Brenner), and a couple of original stories by\nAllcroft and Mitton.[13]\n\nOne of the primary reasons for diverging from the original books was that many\nof the stories not yet used featured large numbers of new characters, which\nwould be expensive to produce. Another reason was that the producers wanted\nmore stories about [Thomas](/wiki/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine \"Thomas the Tank\nEngine\"), the nominal main character. Awdry worried that the new stories would\nbe unrealistic (see [Henry the Green Engine](/wiki/Henry_the_Green_Engine\n\"Henry the Green Engine\") for more details).[13] [Robert D.\nCardona](/wiki/Robert_D._Cardona \"Robert D. Cardona\") left as producer, while\n[Britt Allcroft](/wiki/Britt_Allcroft \"Britt Allcroft\") joined [David\nMitton](/wiki/David_Mitton \"David Mitton\") as co-producer. [Angus\nWright](/wiki/Angus_Wright_\\(producer\\) \"Angus Wright \\(producer\\)\") took over\nas executive producer.\n\nSeries four was broadcast in 1994 on [Cartoon\nNetwork](/wiki/Cartoon_Network_\\(UK_and_Ireland\\) \"Cartoon Network \\(UK and\nIreland\\)\"). The producers planned to introduce some new female characters,\nincluding motor car [Caroline](/wiki/Non-\nrail_vehicles_\\(Thomas_%26_Friends\\)#Caroline \"Non-rail vehicles \\(Thomas &\nFriends\\)\"),\n[Nancy](/wiki/People_and_animals_\\(Thomas_the_Tank_Engine_and_Friends\\)#Nancy\n\"People and animals \\(Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\\)\"), and [The\nRefreshment\nLady](/wiki/People_and_animals_\\(Thomas_the_Tank_Engine_and_Friends\\)#The_Refreshment_Lady\n\"People and animals \\(Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\\)\").[14] Some\ncommentators took this as a response to accusations of [sexism](/wiki/Sexism\n\"Sexism\") levelled against the series two years earlier.[15] In reality, these\nwere not \"new\" characters, but creations of Awdry from the original _Railway\nSeries_ books. Series four was almost entirely based on _The Railway Series_.\nThe [narrow gauge](/wiki/Narrow_gauge_railway \"Narrow gauge railway\") engines\nwere introduced, and were the focus of a number of episodes. Only one original\nstory (\"Rusty to the Rescue\", written by Allcroft and Mitton) was used, but\nthis took certain elements of plot and dialogue from [_Stepney the \"Bluebell\"\nEngine_](/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#Stepney_the_.22Bluebell.22_Engine\n\"List of Railway Series Books\").\n\nThe fifth series (1998), also broadcast on Cartoon Network, was a radical\nshift, as all episodes were written by Allcroft and Mitton with no further\nstories being adapted from the \"Railway Series\". This series saw the\nintroduction of new characters, such as [Cranky](/wiki/Cranky_the_Crane\n\"Cranky the Crane\"), [The Horrid Lorries](/wiki/The_Horrid_Lorries \"The Horrid\nLorries\") and [Old Slow Coach](/wiki/Old_Slow_Coach \"Old Slow Coach\"). It also\nfocused on more dramatic and edgy plot-lines, with more severe accidents, than\nin the earlier seasons.[16] After series 5, Angus Wright stepped down as\nexecutive producer.\n\n_[Thomas and the Magic Railroad](/wiki/Thomas_and_the_Magic_Railroad \"Thomas\nand the Magic Railroad\")_ was released in July 2000 in the UK, Canada, and the\nUnited States. It featured new characters created by Allcroft, along with\ncharacters from the show that introduced _Thomas_ to the U.S., _[Shining Time\nStation](/wiki/Shining_Time_Station \"Shining Time Station\")_. Despite high\nproduction values and the popularity of the show, the film was criticised by\nBritish reviewers who were unfamiliar with _Shining Time Station_. The movie\nwas well received by young children on both sides of the Atlantic, but made\nonly $19.7 million at the box office,[17] against a cost of $19 million to\nproduce.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The film was broadcast on BBC1 on 1 January\n2004 and again on 29 December 2008.\n\n### _Thomas & Friends_ and its recent developments\n\nThe Britt Allcroft Company (which changed its name to [Gullane\nEntertainment](/wiki/Gullane_Entertainment \"Gullane Entertainment\") in 1999)\nwas purchased by [HiT Entertainment](/wiki/HiT_Entertainment \"HiT\nEntertainment\") in September 2003,[18][19] a company specialising in\nchildren's entertainment.\n\nThe sixth and seventh series (both broadcast on [CITV](/wiki/CITV \"CITV\"))\ncontinued to introduce action-packed storylines and new characters, and saw\nthe introduction of a writing staff. The sixth series in 2002 was notable for\nits attempt to create a spin-off based on the successful \"Bob the Builder\"\nseries. Two episodes introduced a group of construction machine characters\nknown as \"The Pack\". The spin-off didn't materialise for some time.\nEventually, in 2006, thirteen episodes were released straight to DVD as a\ncollection called _[On Site with Thomas](/wiki/On_Site_with_Thomas \"On Site\nwith Thomas\")_.\n\nThe fact that older sets were used and the episodes were shot on 35mm camera\n(as opposed to the digital camera used at the time of the episodes' release)\nsuggest it was filmed some time before Series 8. In Series 7 (2003) the\nprogramme title was officially shortened to _Thomas & Friends_, this name\nhaving been used on merchandise and video covers for three years previously.\nPhil Fehrle replaced Allcroft and Mitton as producer, though Mitton remained\nas the director. Executive producer [Angus\nWright](/wiki/Angus_Wright_\\(producer\\) \"Angus Wright \\(producer\\)\") was\nreplaced by Peter Urie and Allcroft as executive producers for Series 6.\n\nIn 2003, Allcroft stepped down as executive producer, making Urie the sole\nexecutive producer for [Gullane Entertainment](/wiki/Gullane_Entertainment\n\"Gullane Entertainment\"), and Jocelyn Stevenson was the executive producer for\n[HiT Entertainment](/wiki/HiT_Entertainment \"HiT Entertainment\").\n\nThe eighth series (2004) was the first released directly to VHS and DVD as\nfour episodes in the US and six in the UK were released before airing on\ntelevision on [Nick Jr.](/wiki/Nick_Jr._\\(UK_and_Ireland\\) \"Nick Jr. \\(UK and\nIreland\\)\") in the UK and [PBS](/wiki/PBS \"PBS\") in the US. It introduced a\nnumber of significant changes to the show. Many of the original founding team\ninvolved in the original show since 1984 left the production, notably Britt\nAllcroft, director and writer David Mitton, and original composers Mike\nO'Donnell and [Junior Campbell](/wiki/Junior_Campbell \"Junior Campbell\"). The\nlatter two had been embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with HiT before\ntheir departure.[20][21] Steve Asquith, who was part of the original\nproduction team since 1984, took over as director, while Simon Spencer\nreplaced Phil Fehrle as producer.\n\nA new theme song and incidental music were composed by [Ed\nWelch](/wiki/Ed_Welch \"Ed Welch\") and Robert Hartshorne, respectively. Episode\nruntime was increased to seven minutes. The series was produced using digital\nvideo camera, creating a somewhat different look for the show. Other changes\nincluded the additions of CGI educational sequences and transitions between\nstories. Executive producer Peter Urie also left, while Jocelyn Stevenson\nremained in her role as executive producer. Sam Barlow became the story\nexecutive, while Abi Grant and Paul Larson served as script editors. This\nseries saw the adoption of a centralised cast, including [Thomas the Tank\nEngine](/wiki/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine \"Thomas the Tank Engine\"),\n[Edward](/wiki/Edward_the_Blue_Engine \"Edward the Blue Engine\"),\n[Henry](/wiki/Henry_the_Green_Engine \"Henry the Green Engine\"),\n[Gordon](/wiki/Gordon_the_Big_Engine \"Gordon the Big Engine\"),\n[James](/wiki/James_the_Red_Engine \"James the Red Engine\"),\n[Percy](/wiki/Percy_the_Small_Engine \"Percy the Small Engine\"),\n[Toby](/wiki/Toby_the_Tram_Engine \"Toby the Tram Engine\") and\n[Emily](/wiki/Emily_\\(Thomas_the_Tank_Engine\\) \"Emily \\(Thomas the Tank\nEngine\\)\").\n\nHiT Entertainment was itself then acquired by [Apax\nPartners](/wiki/Apax_Partners \"Apax Partners\"), a private equity company, in\nMarch 2005.[22]\n\nA straight-to-video film, _[Calling All Engines!](/wiki/Calling_All_Engines!\n\"Calling All Engines!\")_ , was released shortly before Series 9 in 2005. While\nfeaturing characters from _Thomas and the Magic Railroad_ , it was not a\ndirect sequel. It proved successful, which resulted in more direct-to-video\nspecials being produced.[23]\n\nSeries 9 (2005) and 10 (2006) saw the expansion of the supporting cast with\nnew and old characters. From Series 9 the narrator would call out the\nepisodes' names and from Series 11 the theme song was sung starting with the\nsound of a train whistle. Series 10 aired with twenty-eight episodes rather\nthan the twenty-six of previous years. The eleventh series (2007) was filmed\nin [high definition](/wiki/High-definition_television \"High-definition\ntelevision\") format. Twenty episodes aired in the original broadcast, while\nsix were released directed to DVD as Engines and Escapades. Jocelyn Stevenson\nhad stepped down as executive producer after Series 10, with Christopher Skala\ntaking her place as executive producer for Series 11. Sharon Miller became the\nscript editor from Series 9 to 11.\n\nSeries 12 (2008) saw the introduction of CGI effects (provided by HiT\nEntertainment's subsidiary [Hot Animation](/wiki/Hot_Animation \"Hot\nAnimation\")), with the intent of producing the show entirely in CGI the\nfollowing year.[24] The traditional models and sets were still used, but with\ncomputer animated faces superimposed on the models to allow for changing\nfacial expressions. Humans and animals were fully computer animated to allow\nfor walking movement. Only twenty episodes were broadcast (the U.S. broadcast\nfeatured six additional episodes from _Engines and Escapades_). Sharon Miller\nbecame the head writer, starting with Series 12.\n\nHiT announced multiple changes to the show beginning in 2009. One new aspect\nwas the introduction of live-action host segments to _Thomas '_ home video\nreleases. The host took the form of a character who worked on The Fat\nController's (Sir Topham Hatt's) railway, who would instruct viewers in craft\nprojects. For the final 2 DVDs released for Season 12 in 2009, the host was\nnamed Mr. Arkwright (played by Robert Slate). In 2010, beginning with the DVD\nSplish splash splosh, the host was named Mr. Perkins (played by [Ben\nForster](/wiki/Ben_Forster_\\(actor\\) \"Ben Forster \\(actor\\)\")) and has\nremained host ever since.\n\nFor budgetary reasons, the other major changes were a move to production in\nCGI, rather than using physical models, and the addition of a voice cast to\nsupport the established narrator. The DVD feature, _[Hero of the\nRails](/wiki/Hero_of_the_Rails \"Hero of the Rails\")_ , was the first _Thomas &\nFriends_ production to show these changes, and Series 13 was the first\ntelevision series in the new format. The CGI animation for the series was\nprovided by Nitrogen Studios of [Vancouver](/wiki/Vancouver \"Vancouver\").\n\nIn September 2010, Apax was preparing to sell off HiT Entertainment and its\nfranchises, including Thomas – regarded as the single most valuable asset – in\norder to help clear HiT's debts,[25][26][27] and in February 2012, sold the\ncompany, along with the Thomas properties, to US toy giant\n[Mattel](/wiki/Mattel \"Mattel\").[28]\n\nDuring production of Series 16 (2012), Sharon Miller stepped down as head\nwriter, and Andrew Brenner, who had written some _Thomas_ stories in the third\nseries, assumed the role after serving as script editor for \"Blue Mountain\nMystery\". Additionally, Sam Barlow stepped down as story executive after the\nsixteenth series, and the production of the CGI animation was moved from\nNitrogen Studios (of Vancouver) to [Arc Productions](/wiki/Arc_Productions\n\"Arc Productions\") (of [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\")).[29] _[King of the\nRailway](/wiki/King_of_the_Railway \"King of the Railway\")_ and Series 17, both\nreleased during 2013, serve as the first special and series developed by the\nnew animation and production team respectively.\n\n2014 saw _[Tale of the Brave](/wiki/Tale_of_the_Brave \"Tale of the Brave\")_\nand Series 18, the second special and series animated by Arc, respectively.\nAnd in the following year, 2015 saw _[The Adventure\nBegins](/wiki/Thomas_%26_Friends:_The_Adventure_Begins \"Thomas & Friends: The\nAdventure Begins\")_ , a special coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the\nfranchise; and _[Sodor's Legend of the Lost\nTreasure](/wiki/Sodor%27s_Legend_of_the_Lost_Treasure \"Sodor's Legend of the\nLost Treasure\")_. Series 19 began airing that same year. 2016 saw some\nchanges. Longtime composers Robert and Peter Hartshorne, father and son team,\nleft the series and Chris Renshaw and Oliver Davis took over. 2016 also saw\n_[Thomas& Friends: The Great Race](/wiki/Thomas_%26_Friends:_The_Great_Race\n\"Thomas & Friends: The Great Race\")_ and Series 20 began airing the same year.\n\n## Cast\n\nMain article: [List of Thomas & Friends voice\nactors](/wiki/List_of_Thomas_%26_Friends_voice_actors \"List of Thomas &\nFriends voice actors\")\n\nOriginally, a narrator was used as the only voice in the series until 2008.\nBritt Allcroft thought it essential to convey the episode as a story that\nwould be read from a book at home. Individual voice-over actors were given to\nboth the UK and US dubs of the Series, following the switch to full CGI\nanimation in 2009.\n\n## List of productions\n\n### Television series\n\nMain article: [List of Thomas & Friends\nepisodes](/wiki/List_of_Thomas_%26_Friends_episodes \"List of Thomas & Friends\nepisodes\")\n\nSeries | Year | Episodes | DVD release date (R2) | DVD release date (R4)  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n[1](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_1\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 1\\)\") | 1984 | 26 | 31 January 2005[30] | 2 May 2006[31]  \n[2](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_2\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 2\\)\") | 1986 | 18 April 2005[32] | 13 April 2006[33]  \n[3](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_3\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 3\\)\") | 1991–92 | 23 January 2006[34] | 6 July 2006[35]  \n[4](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_4\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 4\\)\") | 1994–95 | 24 July 2006[36] | 8 September 2006[37]  \n[5](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_5\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 5\\)\") | 1998 | 5 February 2007[38] | 8 September 2006[39]  \n[6](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_6\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 6\\)\") | 2002 | 2 July 2007[40] | 5 January 2009[41]  \n[7](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_7\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 7\\)\") | 2003 | 14 January 2008[42] | 4 June 2009[43]  \n[8](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_8\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 8\\)\") | 2004 | 28 July 2008[44] | 4 June 2009[45]  \n[9](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_9\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 9\\)\") | 2005 | 19 January 2009[46] | 2 March 2010[47]  \n[10](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_10\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 10\\)\") | 2006 | 28 | 17 May 2010[48] | 2 June 2010[49]  \n[11](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_11\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 11\\)\") | 2007 | 26 | 26 July 2010[50] | 2 June 2011[51]  \n[12](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_12\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 12\\)\") | 2008 | 20 | 21 February 2011[52] | 1 March 2012[53]  \n[13](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_13\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 13\\)\") | 2010 | 13 February 2012[54] |   \n[14](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_14\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 14\\)\") | 22 July 2013[55] |   \n[15](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_15\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 15\\)\") | 2011 | 7 July 2014 |   \n[16](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_16\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 16\\)\") | 2012 | 25 May 2015[56] |   \n[17](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_17\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 17\\)\") | 2013–14 | 26 | 18 July 2016[57] |   \n[18](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_18\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 18\\)\") | 2014–15 | 19 June 2017[58] |   \n[19](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_\\(series_19\\) \"Thomas and Friends \\(series 19\\)\") | 2015–17 |  |   \n[20](/wiki/Thomas_%26_Friends_\\(series_20\\) \"Thomas & Friends \\(series 20\\)\") | 2016–17 | 28 |  |   \n[21](/wiki/Thomas_%26_Friends_\\(series_21\\) \"Thomas & Friends \\(series 21\\)\") | 2017 |  |  |   \n  \n### Films, specials, and miniseries\n\nMain article: [Thomas & Friends (franchise) § Direct-to-video\nspecials](/wiki/Thomas_%26_Friends_\\(franchise\\)#Direct-to-video_specials\n\"Thomas & Friends \\(franchise\\)\")\n\n### Home video history\n\nMain article: [Thomas and Friends video\nreleases](/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends_video_releases \"Thomas and Friends video\nreleases\")\n\nOver the history of the programme, the TV episodes and specials have been\nreleased for home viewing in a variety of compilations, formats and languages,\nby a variety of publishing houses.\n\n## Production\n\n### Characters\n\nFurther information: [List of Thomas & Friends railway\nengines](/wiki/List_of_Thomas_%26_Friends_railway_engines \"List of Thomas &\nFriends railway engines\"), [List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge\nengines](/wiki/List_of_Thomas_%26_Friends_narrow-gauge_engines \"List of Thomas\n& Friends narrow-gauge engines\"), [Arlesdale Railway](/wiki/Arlesdale_Railway\n\"Arlesdale Railway\"), [List of Thomas & Friends rolling\nstock](/wiki/List_of_Thomas_%26_Friends_rolling_stock \"List of Thomas &\nFriends rolling stock\"), [List of Thomas & Friends non-rail\nvehicles](/wiki/List_of_Thomas_%26_Friends_non-rail_vehicles \"List of Thomas &\nFriends non-rail vehicles\"), [List of people and animals from Thomas &\nFriends](/wiki/List_of_people_and_animals_from_Thomas_%26_Friends \"List of\npeople and animals from Thomas & Friends\"), and [Thomas the Tank Engine film\ncharacters](/wiki/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine_film_characters \"Thomas the Tank\nEngine film characters\")\n\n### Storytelling\n\nUp until Series 12, narration and dialogue were performed by a single\nstoryteller. This was the choice of Allcroft, who wanted the television\nstories to be an extension of the way they would be told at home in a\ncomforting environment. All character emotions would come from the nuances of\nthe storyteller's voice, in conjunction with facial expressions, music, and\nactions on-screen.\n\n### Models\n\nThe original live action models were filmed on an extensive [model\nrailway](/wiki/Model_railway \"Model railway\") layout built at the studios. The\nmodels were built to the 1:32 scale, known in model railway circles as \"[Gauge\n1](/wiki/Gauge_1 \"Gauge 1\")\". The locomotives used chassis made by\n[Märklin](/wiki/M%C3%A4rklin \"Märklin\") with specially made bodies. Along with\nthe moving-eye and eyelid mechanisms and clay faces, these bodies also\nincluded smoke generators. Coaches and trucks were made using Tenmille kits.\nLater models were constructed entirely from scratch. Some of the models from\nthe sister television series _[Tugs](/wiki/Tugs_\\(TV_series\\) \"Tugs \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ were reused in later episodes of the series.\n\nFrom Series 5 to 12, some larger-scale models were used for the [narrow\ngauge](/wiki/Skarloey_Railway \"Skarloey Railway\") characters, to more easily\nfit the complex mechanisms into them while retaining a sufficient level of\ndetail. In Series 6, the characters known as \"the Pack\" (construction\nmachines) were also constructed on a large scale, and larger models of\n[Thomas](/wiki/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine \"Thomas the Tank Engine\") and\n[Percy](/wiki/Percy_the_Small_Engine \"Percy the Small Engine\") were made to\ninteract with them. In the ninth series, another larger Thomas model was built\nto the same scale as the narrow gauge engines to provide greater possibilities\nfor interaction. It was joined by a large version of\n[James](/wiki/James_the_Red_Engine \"James the Red Engine\") in the tenth\nseries. In 2009, some of these models were put on display in a special exhibit\nat [Drayton Manor Theme Park](/wiki/Drayton_Manor_Theme_Park \"Drayton Manor\nTheme Park\")'s [Thomas Land](/wiki/Thomas_Land_\\(Drayton_Manor\\) \"Thomas Land\n\\(Drayton Manor\\)\").[59] Nitrogen Studios, who provided the animation for the\nseries from series 12 to 16, also has some of the original models on display.\n\n### Face movements\n\nAt the show's conception in 1984, live action model animation would not\ndeliver [lip sync](/wiki/Lip_sync \"Lip sync\"), but show co-creator [Britt\nAllcroft](/wiki/Britt_Allcroft \"Britt Allcroft\") and model director [David\nMitton](/wiki/David_Mitton \"David Mitton\") did not see this as an inhibition.\nAbout 20 years later however, with advancement in technology, the show saw the\nintroduction of [CGI](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-generated\nimagery\") by HIT Entertainment's subsidiary HOT Animation.[60] At first this\nwas used to generate smoke and other effects, but later,\n[HIT](/wiki/HIT_Entertainment \"HIT Entertainment\") (the current owners of\n_Thomas_) announced its intent to introduce a fully CGI series in 2009.[61]\nWith Series 12, CGI by Nitrogen Studios was used to animate characters' faces\nand to make people and animals mobile within the stories. The following series\nsaw a transition to full CGI animation.\n\n### Music\n\nMike O'Donnell and [Junior Campbell](/wiki/Junior_Campbell \"Junior Campbell\")\ncomposed the show's original main title theme, incidental music and songs,\nwhich were used for series 1–7 comprising 182 episodes between 1984 and 2003.\n\nIn 2004, Robert Hartshorne took O'Donnell and Campbell's place as composer,\nwhile [Ed Welch](/wiki/Ed_Welch \"Ed Welch\") became the show's songwriter from\nSeries 8 to _[The Great Discovery](/wiki/The_Great_Discovery \"The Great\nDiscovery\")_ , and Welch left after _The Great Discovery_. Hartshorne took his\nplace as songwriter from Series 12 and onwards. From _[Day of the\nDiesels](/wiki/Day_of_the_Diesels \"Day of the Diesels\")_ /2011-2016, Robert's\nson Peter Hartshorne helped him with the music.\n\nIn 2016 the Hartshornes left the series and Chris Renshaw and Oliver Davis\ntook their places.\n\n### Head writer\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

The Thomas the Tank Engine\nstories were conceived by a young British boy early in the 20th century, who\nwould listen to the trains as they chuffed through the countryside. The\nstories he told his son -- who has consequently passed them on to his own son\n-- have been documented in books and toy train models. Since the series was\nintroduced to television viewers in the 1980s, Thomas & Friends has seen a\nhealthy fan base sprout worldwide.
