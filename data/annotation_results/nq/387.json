As per the [Constitution of\nIndia](/wiki/Constitution_of_India \"Constitution of India\"), the\n[governor](/wiki/Governor_\\(India\\) \"Governor \\(India\\)\") is the state's _[de\njure](/wiki/De_jure \"De jure\")_ head, but _[de facto](/wiki/De_facto \"De\nfacto\")_ executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following\nelections to the [Uttar Pradesh Legislative\nAssembly](/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh_Legislative_Assembly \"Uttar Pradesh Legislative\nAssembly\"), the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a\nmajority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief\nminister, whose [council of ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_\\(government\\) \"Cabinet\n\\(government\\)\") are [collectively\nresponsible](/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility \"Cabinet collective\nresponsibility\") to the assembly. Given that he has the confidence of the\nassembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no\n[term limits](/wiki/Term_limit \"Term limit\").[1]\n\nOn [26 January 1950](/wiki/Republic_Day_\\(India\\) \"Republic Day \\(India\\)\")\n[Govind Ballabh Pant](/wiki/Govind_Ballabh_Pant \"Govind Ballabh Pant\"),\nPremier of [United Provinces](/wiki/United_Provinces_\\(1937%E2%80%9350\\)\n\"United Provinces \\(1937–50\\)\"), became the first Chief Minister of the newly\nrenamed Uttar Pradesh.
