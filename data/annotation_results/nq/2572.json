Hermione wins the mayoral\nelection. Hiram secretly meets with several shady people from around Riverdale\n(Penny, Penelope, Claudius, Sheriff Minetta, and Malachi, the leader of the\nGhoulies) and they discuss joining forces for their sinister plans for the new\nSouthside High. Archie is elected student body president, but during his\ninauguration, he is wrongfully arrested by the corrupt Sheriff Minetta (on the\nvindictive Hiram's orders) for the murder of one of the intruders from the\nlake house.  \n  \n## Production\n\n### Development\n\n[Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") began development on an\n_Archie_ feature film in 2013, after a pitch from writer Roberto Aguirre-\nSacasa and director [Jason Moore](/wiki/Jason_Moore_\\(director\\) \"Jason Moore\n\\(director\\)\") that would place Archie's gang into a teen comedy feature film\nin the [John Hughes](/wiki/John_Hughes_\\(filmmaker\\) \"John Hughes\n\\(filmmaker\\)\") tradition.[50] The duo brought the project to Warner Bros.,\nwhere a VP recommended a more [high-concept](/wiki/High-concept \"High-\nconcept\") direction involving [time travel](/wiki/Time_travel \"Time travel\")\nor [interdimensional portals](/wiki/Portals_in_fiction \"Portals in fiction\"),\nsuggesting [Louis C.

It certainly felt that\nway.\"[57] The production team found KJ Apa just three days before they had to\npresent screen tests to the network, which created tension in the last few\ndays leading up to the studio presentation.[57]\n\nIn April 2017, it was announced [Mark Consuelos](/wiki/Mark_Consuelos \"Mark\nConsuelos\") had signed on for the second season to play Veronica Lodge's\nfather, [Hiram Lodge](/wiki/Hiram_Lodge \"Hiram Lodge\").[58] The role was in\nsecond position to his existing role on _[Pitch](/wiki/Pitch_\\(TV_series\\)\n\"Pitch \\(TV series\\)\")_ but the cancellation of that series was announced on\nMay 1, 2017.[59] The next month, it was announced Charles Melton was cast to\ntake over the role of Reggie from [Ross Butler](/wiki/Ross_Butler_\\(actor\\)\n\"Ross Butler \\(actor\\)\") in season 2 due to his status as a series regular on\n_[13 Reasons Why](/wiki/13_Reasons_Why \"13 Reasons Why\")_.[60] It was also\nannounced that [Casey Cott](/wiki/Casey_Cott \"Casey Cott\"), who played [Kevin\nKeller](/wiki/Kevin_Keller_\\(comics\\) \"Kevin Keller \\(comics\\)\"), was promoted\nto a series regular.[61] In July 2017, it was announced that _[True\nBlood](/wiki/True_Blood \"True Blood\")_ star [Brit Morgan](/wiki/Brit_Morgan\n\"Brit Morgan\") had been cast in the recurring role of Penny Peabody, an\nattorney the Southside Serpents call in case of any run-ins with the law.[62]\nIn August 2017, it was announced [Graham\nPhillips](/wiki/Graham_Phillips_\\(actor\\) \"Graham Phillips \\(actor\\)\") had\nbeen cast to play Nick St. Clair, Veronica's ex-boyfriend from New\nYork.[63][64]\n\nIn March 2018, [Andy Cohen](/wiki/Andy_Cohen_\\(television_personality\\) \"Andy\nCohen \\(television personality\\)\") appeared in the sixteenth episode of the\nsecond season as himself.

On [Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\"), it has\na fresh rating of 88% based on 54 reviews, with a [weighted\naverage](/wiki/Weighted_average \"Weighted average\") of 7.27/10. The site's\ncritical consensus reads, \"_Riverdale_ offers an amusingly self-aware\nreimagining of its classic source material that proves eerie, odd, daring, and\nabove all addictive.\"[100] On [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\"), the\nseason has a score of 68 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally\nfavorable reviews\".[101] Dave Nemetz of [TVLine](/wiki/TVLine \"TVLine\") gave\nthe series a \"B+\" saying that it turned, \"out to be an artfully crafted,\ninstantly engaging teen soap with loads of potential.\"[102]\n\nSome writers have criticized the series for its handling of minority\ncharacters. While reviewing the first season, Kadeen Griffiths of _Bustle_\ndeclared \"the show marginalizes and ignores the [people of color] in the cast\nto the point where they may as well not be there.\"[103] In an article for\n_[Vulture](/wiki/New_York_\\(magazine\\) \"New York \\(magazine\\)\")_ , Angelica\nJade Bastien discussed the show's treatment of Josie and the Pussycats (who\nare each played by African Americans), noting, \"They're not characters so much\nas they are a vehicle for a Message. Josie and her fellow pussycats are\npositioned to communicate the message that _Riverdale_ is more modern and\ninclusive than teen dramas of the past, even though it has yet to prove it\nbeyond its casting.\"[104] Monique Jones of _[Ebony](/wiki/Ebony_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Ebony \\(magazine\\)\")_ noted, \"Despite the show's multi-racial casting\nchoices, it seems like Riverdale is still a mostly white town.\" She also\nexpressed fondness for the relationship between Archie Andrews and Valerie\nBrown, but declared \"Archie shouldn't be what makes Valerie interesting to\nus\".[105]\n\n### Ratings\n\nSeason | Timeslot ([ET](/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone \"Eastern Time Zone\")) | Episodes | First aired | Last aired | TV season | Rank | Avg. viewers  \n(millions) | 18–49 rating  \n(average)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nDate | Viewers  \n(millions) | Date | Viewers  \n(millions)  \n1 | Thursday 9:00 pm | 13 | January 26, 2017 (2017-01-26) | 1.38[15] | May 11, 2017 (2017-05-11) | 0.96[27] | [2016–17](/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2016–17 United States network television schedule\") | 154 | 1.69 | 0.7/2[14]  \n2 | Wednesday 8:00 pm | 22 | October 11, 2017 (2017-10-11) | 2.34[28] | May 16, 2018 (2018-05-16) | 1.28[49] | [2017–18](/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2017–18 United States network television schedule\") | 173 | 2.12 | 0.8[106]  \n  \n**_Riverdale_ : U.S. viewers per episode (millions)**\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/0435e6eddbdb03a35c80dcab86f9fc4b.png)\n\nSource: [Nielsen Media Research](/wiki/Nielsen_ratings \"Nielsen\nratings\")[107][108]\n\n#### Season 1 (2017)\n\nNo. | Title | Air date | [Rating/share](/wiki/Nielsen_ratings \"Nielsen ratings\")  \n(18–49) | Viewers  \n(millions) | DVR  \n(18–49) | DVR viewers  \n(millions) | Total  \n(18–49) | Total viewers  \n(millions)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | \"Chapter One: The River's Edge\" | January 26, 2017 | 0.5/2 | 1.38[15] | 0.4 | 1.01 | 0.9 | 2.38[109]  \n2 | \"Chapter Two: A Touch of Evil\" | February 2, 2017 | 0.4/2 | 1.15[16] | 0.4 | 0.76 | 0.8 | 1.91[110]  \n3 | \"Chapter Three: Body Double\" | February 9, 2017 | 0.5/2 | 1.20[17] | N/A | 0.71 | N/A | 1.90[111]  \n4 | \"Chapter Four: The Last Picture Show\" | February 16, 2017 | 0.4/1 | 1.14[18] | 0.4 | 0.73 | 0.8 | 1.87[112]  \n5 | \"Chapter Five: Heart of Darkness\" | February 23, 2017 | 0.3/1 | 0.98[19] | 0.4 | 0.71 | 0.7 | 1.69[113]  \n6 | \"Chapter Six: Faster, Pussycats!
