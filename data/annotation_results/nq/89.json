court of the United\nStates](/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States \"Federal judiciary of the\nUnited States\"). Established pursuant to [Article Three of the United States\nConstitution](/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article\nThree of the United States Constitution\") in 1789, it has ultimate (and\nlargely\n[discretionary](/wiki/Procedures_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States\n\"Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States\")) [appellate\njurisdiction](/wiki/Appellate_jurisdiction \"Appellate jurisdiction\") over all\nfederal courts and [state court](/wiki/State_court_\\(United_States\\) \"State\ncourt \\(United States\\)\") cases involving issues of [federal\nlaw](/wiki/U.S._federal_law \"U.S. federal law\") plus [original\njurisdiction](/wiki/Original_jurisdiction \"Original jurisdiction\") over a\nsmall range of cases. In the [legal system of the United\nStates](/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States \"Law of the United States\"), the\nSupreme Court is generally the final interpreter of [federal\nlaw](/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States \"Law of the United States\") including the\n[United States Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States\nConstitution\"), but it may act only within the context of a case, in which it\nhas jurisdiction. The Court may decide cases having political overtones but\ndoes not have power to decide [nonjusticiable](/wiki/Justiciability\n\"Justiciability\") [political questions](/wiki/Political_question \"Political\nquestion\"), and [its enforcement arm](/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service\n\"United States Marshals Service\") is in the executive rather than judicial\nbranch of government.\n\nAccording to federal statute, the Court normally consists of the [Chief\nJustice of the United States](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States \"Chief\nJustice of the United States\") and eight [associate\njustices](/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States\n\"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\") who are\nnominated by the [President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President\nof the United States\") and confirmed by the\n[Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\"). Once appointed,\njustices have [lifetime tenure](/wiki/Life_tenure \"Life tenure\") unless they\nresign, retire, or are removed after\n[impeachment](/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States \"Impeachment in the\nUnited States\") (though no justice has ever been removed).[2] In modern\ndiscourse, the justices are often categorized as having\n[conservative](/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States#Courts \"Conservatism in\nthe United States\"), [moderate](/wiki/Moderate \"Moderate\"), or\n[liberal](/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States#Courts \"Liberalism in the\nUnited States\") [philosophies of law](/wiki/Philosophy_of_law \"Philosophy of\nlaw\") and of [judicial interpretation](/wiki/Judicial_interpretation \"Judicial\ninterpretation\"). Each justice has one vote, and it is worth noting that while\na far greater number of cases in recent history have been decided unanimously,\ndecisions in cases of the highest profile have often come down to just one\nsingle vote, thereby exposing the justices' ideological beliefs that track\nwith those philosophical or political categories.

Its powers are detailed in [Article\nThree of the\nConstitution](/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article\nThree of the United States Constitution\"). The Supreme Court was the only\ncourt specifically established by the Constitution while all other federal\ncourts were created by [Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States\nCongress\"). Congress is also responsible for conferring the title of \"justice\"\nto its members, who are known to scold lawyers for inaccurately referring to\nthem as \"judge\", even though it is the term used in the Constitution.[4]\n\nThe Court first convened on February 2, 1790[5] with six judges where only\nfive of its six initial positions were filled. According to historian Fergus\nBordewich, in its first session: \"[T]he Supreme Court convened for the first\ntime at the [Royal Exchange Building](/wiki/Royal_Exchange,_New_York \"Royal\nExchange, New York\") on Broad Street, a few steps from Federal Hall.\nSymbolically, the moment was pregnant with promise for the republic, this\nbirth of a new national institution whose future power, admittedly, still\nexisted only in the eyes and minds of just a few visionary Americans.\nImpressively bewigged and swathed in their robes of office, Chief Justice John\nJay and three associate justices — William Cushing of Massachusetts, James\nWilson of Pennsylvania, and John Blair of Virginia — sat augustly before a\nthrong of spectators and waited for something to happen. Nothing did. They had\nno cases to consider. After a week of inactivity, they adjourned until\nSeptember, and everyone went home.\"[6]\n\nThe sixth member, [James Iredell](/wiki/James_Iredell \"James Iredell\"), was\nnot confirmed until May 12, 1790. Because the full Court had only six members,\nevery decision that it made by a majority was also made by two-thirds (voting\nfour to two).[7] However, Congress has always allowed less than the Court's\nfull membership to make decisions, starting with a [quorum](/wiki/Quorum\n\"Quorum\") of four justices in 1789.[8]\n\n### Earliest beginnings to\nMarshall[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Earliest beginnings to Marshall\")]\n\nMain articles: [Jay Court](/wiki/Jay_Court \"Jay Court\"), [Rutledge\nCourt](/wiki/Rutledge_Court \"Rutledge Court\"), [Ellsworth\nCourt](/wiki/Ellsworth_Court \"Ellsworth Court\"), and [Marshall\nCourt](/wiki/Marshall_Court \"Marshall Court\")\n\nUnder Chief Justices [Jay](/wiki/John_Jay \"John Jay\"),\n[Rutledge](/wiki/John_Rutledge \"John Rutledge\"), and\n[Ellsworth](/wiki/Oliver_Ellsworth \"Oliver Ellsworth\") (1789–1801), the Court\nheard few cases; its first decision was _[West v. Barnes](/wiki/West_v._Barnes\n\"West v. Barnes\")_ (1791), a case involving a procedural issue.[9] The Court\nlacked a home of its own and had little prestige,[10] a situation not helped\nby the highest-profile case of the era, _[Chisholm v.\nGeorgia](/wiki/Chisholm_v._Georgia \"Chisholm v. Georgia\")_ (1793), which was\nreversed within two years by the adoption of the [Eleventh\nAmendment](/wiki/Eleventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution\").[11]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Chief_Justice_John_Marshall.jpeg/200px-\nChief_Justice_John_Marshall.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Chief_Justice_John_Marshall.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chief_Justice_John_Marshall.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\nChief Justice Marshall\n\nThe Court's power and prestige grew substantially during the\n[Marshall](/wiki/John_Marshall \"John Marshall\") Court (1801–35).[12] Under\nMarshall, the Court established the power of [judicial\nreview](/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_States \"Judicial review in the\nUnited States\") over acts of Congress,[13] including specifying itself as the\nsupreme expositor of the [Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution\n\"United States Constitution\") (_[Marbury v. Madison](/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison\n\"Marbury v. Madison\")_)[14][15] and made several important constitutional\nrulings giving shape and substance to the [balance of\npower](/wiki/Balance_of_power_\\(federalism\\) \"Balance of power\n\\(federalism\\)\") between the federal government and the states (prominently,\n_[Martin v.

Ogden](/wiki/Gibbons_v._Ogden\n\"Gibbons v.

Sill\")_ , which held that while Congress may not limit the\nsubjects the Supreme Court may hear, it may limit the jurisdiction of the\nlower federal courts to prevent _them_ from hearing cases dealing with certain\nsubjects.[24] Nevertheless, it is primarily remembered for its ruling in\n_[Dred Scott v.

The [Judiciary Act of\n1789](/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789 \"Judiciary Act of 1789\") called for the\nappointment of six \"judges\". Although an [1801 act](/wiki/Midnight_Judges_Act\n\"Midnight Judges Act\") would have reduced the size of the court to five\nmembers upon its next vacancy, an [1802 act](/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1802\n\"Judiciary Act of 1802\") promptly negated the 1801 act, legally restoring the\ncourt's size to six members before any such vacancy occurred. As the nation's\nboundaries grew, Congress added justices to correspond with the growing number\nof judicial circuits: [seven in 1807](/wiki/Seventh_Circuit_Act_of_1807\n\"Seventh Circuit Act of 1807\"), [nine in\n1837](/wiki/Eighth_and_Ninth_Circuits_Act_of_1837 \"Eighth and Ninth Circuits\nAct of 1837\"), and [ten in 1863](/wiki/Tenth_Circuit_Act_of_1863 \"Tenth\nCircuit Act of 1863\").[69]\n\nIn 1866, at the behest of Chief Justice [Chase](/wiki/Salmon_P._Chase \"Salmon\nP. Chase\"), Congress passed [an act](/wiki/Judicial_Circuits_Act \"Judicial\nCircuits Act\") providing that the next three justices to retire would not be\nreplaced, which would thin the bench to seven justices by attrition.\nConsequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. In 1869,\nhowever, the [Circuit Judges Act](/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869 \"Judiciary Act\nof 1869\") returned the number of justices to nine,[70] where it has since\nremained.\n\nPresident [Franklin D. Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D.\nRoosevelt\") attempted to expand the Court in 1937. His proposal envisioned\nappointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached\nthe age of 70 years 6 months and refused retirement, up to a maximum bench of\n15 justices. The proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on\nelderly judges, but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to\n\"pack\" the Court with justices who would support Roosevelt's [New\nDeal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\").[71] The plan, usually called the \"[court-\npacking plan](/wiki/Judicial_Procedures_Reform_Bill_of_1937 \"Judicial\nProcedures Reform Bill of 1937\")\", failed in Congress.[72] Nevertheless, the\nCourt's balance began to shift within months when Justice [van\nDevanter](/wiki/Willis_Van_Devanter \"Willis Van Devanter\") retired and was\nreplaced by Senator [Hugo Black](/wiki/Hugo_Black \"Hugo Black\"). By the end of\n1941, Roosevelt had appointed seven justices and elevated [Harlan Fiske\nStone](/wiki/Harlan_Fiske_Stone \"Harlan Fiske Stone\") to Chief Justice.[73]\n\n### Appointment and\nconfirmation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Appointment and confirmation\")]\n\nMain article: [Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United\nStates](/wiki/Appointment_and_confirmation_to_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States\n\"Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_-\n_Roberts_Court_2017.jpg/300px-Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_-\n_Roberts_Court_2017.jpg)](/wiki/File:Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_-\n_Roberts_Court_2017.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_-_Roberts_Court_2017.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Roberts Court (April 2017 – present). Front row (left to right): [Ruth\nBader Ginsburg](/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg \"Ruth Bader Ginsburg\"), [Anthony\nKennedy](/wiki/Anthony_Kennedy \"Anthony Kennedy\"), [John\nRoberts](/wiki/John_Roberts \"John Roberts\") (Chief Justice), [Clarence\nThomas](/wiki/Clarence_Thomas \"Clarence Thomas\"), and [Stephen\nBreyer](/wiki/Stephen_Breyer \"Stephen Breyer\"). Back row (left to right):\n[Elena Kagan](/wiki/Elena_Kagan \"Elena Kagan\"), [Samuel A.\nAlito](/wiki/Samuel_A._Alito \"Samuel A. Alito\"), [Sonia\nSotomayor](/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor \"Sonia Sotomayor\"), and [Neil\nGorsuch](/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch \"Neil Gorsuch\").\n\nThe U.S. Constitution states that the President \"shall nominate, and by and\nwith the Advice and Consent of the [Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United\nStates Senate\"), shall appoint Judges of the Supreme Court.\"[74] Most\npresidents nominate candidates who broadly share their ideological views,\nalthough a justice's decisions may end up being contrary to a president's\nexpectations. Because the Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a\njustice, a president may nominate anyone to serve, subject to Senate\nconfirmation.\n\nIn modern times, the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention\nfrom the press and advocacy groups, which [lobby](/wiki/Lobbying \"Lobbying\")\nsenators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track\nrecord aligns with the group's views. The [Senate Judiciary\nCommittee](/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary \"United\nStates Senate Committee on the Judiciary\") conducts hearings and votes on\nwhether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive, negative\nor neutral report. The committee's practice of personally interviewing\nnominees is relatively recent. The first nominee to appear before the\ncommittee was [Harlan Fiske Stone](/wiki/Harlan_Fiske_Stone \"Harlan Fiske\nStone\") in 1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to [Wall\nStreet](/wiki/Wall_Street \"Wall Street\"), and the modern practice of\nquestioning began with [John Marshall Harlan II](/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan_II\n\"John Marshall Harlan II\") in 1955.[75] Once the committee reports out the\nnomination, the full Senate considers it. Rejections are relatively uncommon;\nthe Senate has explicitly rejected\n[twelve](/wiki/List_of_failed_nominations_to_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States\n\"List of failed nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States\")\nSupreme Court nominees, most recently [Robert Bork](/wiki/Robert_Bork \"Robert\nBork\"), nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.\n\nAlthough Senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative vote in committee to\nblock a nomination, prior to 2017 a nomination could be blocked by\n[filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster \"Filibuster\") once debate had begun in the full\nSenate. President [Lyndon Johnson](/wiki/Lyndon_Johnson \"Lyndon Johnson\")'s\nnomination of sitting Associate Justice [Abe Fortas](/wiki/Abe_Fortas \"Abe\nFortas\") to succeed [Earl Warren](/wiki/Earl_Warren \"Earl Warren\") as Chief\nJustice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court\nnominee. It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with\nFortas's ethics. President [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\")'s\nnomination of [Neil Gorsuch](/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch \"Neil Gorsuch\") to the seat\nvacated by Antonin Scalia was the second. Unlike the Fortas filibuster,\nhowever, only Democratic Senators voted against\n[cloture](/wiki/Cloture#United_States \"Cloture\") on the Gorsuch nomination,\nciting his perceived conservative judicial philosophy, and the Republican\nmajority's prior refusal to take up President [Barack\nObama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\")'s [nomination of Merrick\nGarland](/wiki/Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination \"Merrick Garland\nSupreme Court nomination\") to fill the vacancy.[76][77][78] This led the\nRepublican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for\nSupreme Court nominations.[79]\n\nNot every Supreme Court nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate. A\npresident may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs,\ntypically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee; this\noccurred most recently with the nomination of [Harriet\nMiers](/wiki/Harriet_Miers \"Harriet Miers\") in 2006. The Senate may also fail\nto act on a nomination, which expires at the end of the session. For example,\nPresident [Dwight Eisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_Eisenhower \"Dwight Eisenhower\")'s\nfirst nomination of [John Marshall Harlan II](/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan_II\n\"John Marshall Harlan II\") in November, 1954 was not acted on by the Senate;\nEisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two\nmonths later. Most recently, as previously noted, the Senate failed to act on\nthe March 2016 nomination of [Merrick Garland](/wiki/Merrick_Garland \"Merrick\nGarland\"); the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was later\nfilled by President [Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\")'s appointment\nof [Neil Gorsuch](/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch \"Neil Gorsuch\").[80]\n\nOnce the Senate confirms a nomination, the president must prepare and sign a\ncommission, to which the Seal of the [Department of\nJustice](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice \"United States Department\nof Justice\") must be affixed, before the new justice can take office.[81] The\nseniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date, not the\nconfirmation or swearing-in date.[82]\n\nBefore 1981, the approval process of justices was usually rapid. From the\n[Truman](/wiki/Harry_Truman \"Harry Truman\") through\n[Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\") administrations, justices were\ntypically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the\npresent, however, the process has taken much longer. Some believe this is\nbecause Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the\npast.[83] According to the [Congressional Research\nService](/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service \"Congressional Research\nService\"), the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote\nsince 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (or 2.3\nmonths).[84][85]\n\n#### Recess\nappointments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Recess appointments\")]\n\nWhen the Senate is in recess, a president may make temporary appointments to\nfill vacancies. [Recess appointees](/wiki/Recess_appointment \"Recess\nappointment\") hold office only until the end of the next Senate session (less\nthan two years). The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue\nserving; of the two chief justices and eleven associate justices who have\nreceived recess appointments, only Chief Justice [John\nRutledge](/wiki/John_Rutledge \"John Rutledge\") was not subsequently\nconfirmed.[86]\n\nNo president since [Dwight D. Eisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight\nD. Eisenhower\") has made a recess appointment to the Court, and the practice\nhas become rare and controversial even in lower federal courts.[87] In 1960,\nafter Eisenhower had made three such appointments, the Senate passed a \"sense\nof the Senate\" resolution that recess appointments to the Court should only be\nmade in \"unusual circumstances.\"[88] Such resolutions are not legally binding\nbut are an expression of Congress's views in the hope of guiding executive\naction.[88][89]\n\nThe 2014 Supreme Court ruling in [National Labor Relations Board v. Noel\nCanning](/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board_v._Noel_Canning \"National Labor\nRelations Board v. Noel Canning\") limited the ability of the President to make\nrecess appointments (including appointments to the Supreme Court), ruling that\nthe Senate decides when the Senate is in session (or in recess). Justice\n[Breyer](/wiki/Stephen_Breyer \"Stephen Breyer\") writing for the Court, stated,\n\"We hold that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is\nin session when it says it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains\nthe capacity to transact Senate business.\"[90] This ruling allows the Senate\nto prevent recess appointments through the use of [pro-forma\nsessions](/wiki/Pro_forma#United_States \"Pro forma\").[91]\n\n###\nTenure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Tenure\")]\n\nThe Constitution provides that justices \"shall hold their offices during good\nbehavior\" (unless appointed during a Senate recess). The term \"good behavior\"\nis understood to mean justices may serve for the remainder of their lives,\nunless they are [impeached and convicted](/wiki/Impeachment \"Impeachment\") by\nCongress, [resign](/wiki/Resignation \"Resignation\"), or\n[retire](/wiki/Retirement \"Retirement\").[92] Only one justice has been\nimpeached by the House of Representatives ([Samuel Chase](/wiki/Samuel_Chase\n\"Samuel Chase\"), March 1804), but he was acquitted in the Senate (March\n1805).[93] Moves to impeach sitting justices have occurred more recently (for\nexample, [William O. Douglas](/wiki/William_O._Douglas \"William O. Douglas\")\nwas the subject of hearings twice, in 1953 and again in 1970; and [Abe\nFortas](/wiki/Abe_Fortas \"Abe Fortas\") resigned while hearings were being\norganized in 1969), but they did not reach a vote in the House. No mechanism\nexists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or\ninjury, but unable (or unwilling) to resign.[94]\n\nBecause justices have indefinite tenure, timing of vacancies can be\nunpredictable. Sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession, as in the early\n1970s when [Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.](/wiki/Lewis_Franklin_Powell,_Jr.\n\"Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.\") and William Rehnquist were nominated to replace\n[Hugo Black](/wiki/Hugo_Black \"Hugo Black\") and [John Marshall Harlan\nII](/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan_II \"John Marshall Harlan II\"), who retired\nwithin a week of each other. Sometimes a great length of time passes between\nnominations, such as the eleven years between [Stephen\nBreyer](/wiki/Stephen_Breyer \"Stephen Breyer\")'s nomination in 1994 to succeed\n[Harry Blackmun](/wiki/Harry_Blackmun \"Harry Blackmun\") and the nomination of\n[John Roberts](/wiki/John_Roberts \"John Roberts\") in 2005 to fill the seat of\n[Sandra Day O'Connor](/wiki/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor \"Sandra Day O'Connor\")\n(though Roberts' nomination was withdrawn and resubmitted for the role of\nChief Justice after Rehnquist died).\n\nDespite the variability, all but four presidents have been able to appoint at\nleast one justice. [William Henry Harrison](/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison\n\"William Henry Harrison\") died a month after taking office, though his\nsuccessor ([John Tyler](/wiki/John_Tyler \"John Tyler\")) made an appointment\nduring that presidential term. Likewise, [Zachary Taylor](/wiki/Zachary_Taylor\n\"Zachary Taylor\") died 16 months after taking office, but his successor\n([Millard Fillmore](/wiki/Millard_Fillmore \"Millard Fillmore\")) also made a\nSupreme Court nomination before the end of that term. [Andrew\nJohnson](/wiki/Andrew_Johnson \"Andrew Johnson\"), who became president after\nthe [assassination of Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln\n\"Assassination of Abraham Lincoln\"), was denied the opportunity to appoint a\njustice by a reduction in the size of the Court. [Jimmy\nCarter](/wiki/Jimmy_Carter \"Jimmy Carter\") is the only person elected\npresident to have left office after at least one full term without having the\nopportunity to appoint a justice. Somewhat similarly, presidents [James\nMonroe](/wiki/James_Monroe \"James Monroe\"), [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\"), and [George\nW. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W. Bush\") each served a full term\nwithout an opportunity to appoint a justice, but made appointments during\ntheir subsequent terms in office. No president who has served more than one\nfull term has gone without at least one opportunity to make an appointment.\n\nThree presidents have appointed justices who together served more than a\ncentury. [Andrew Jackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew Jackson\"), [Abraham\nLincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\"), and [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D.

Among the nine\njustices, there is one African-American (Justice Thomas) and one Hispanic\n(Justice Sotomayor). Two of the justices were born to at least one immigrant\nparent: Justice Alito's parents were born in Italy,[96][97] and Justice\nGinsburg's father was born in Russia.[98] At least five justices are [Roman\nCatholics](/wiki/Roman_Catholics \"Roman Catholics\") and three are\n[Jewish](/wiki/Judaism \"Judaism\"); it is unclear whether Neil Gorsuch\nconsiders himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian.[99] The average age is 67\nyears and 4 months. Every current justice has an [Ivy League](/wiki/Ivy_League\n\"Ivy League\") background.[100] Four justices are from the state of New York,\ntwo from California, one from New Jersey, one from Georgia, and one from\nColorado.[101] In the 19th century, every justice was a man of European\ndescent (usually Northern European), and almost always Protestant. Concerns\nabout diversity focused on geography, to represent all\n[regions](/wiki/Regionalism_\\(politics\\) \"Regionalism \\(politics\\)\") of the\ncountry, rather than religious, ethnic, or gender diversity.[102]\n\nMost justices have been Protestants, including 36\n[Episcopalians](/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America\n\"Episcopal Church in the United States of America\"), 19\n[Presbyterians](/wiki/Presbyterian \"Presbyterian\"), 10\n[Unitarians](/wiki/Unitarianism \"Unitarianism\"), 5\n[Methodists](/wiki/Methodist \"Methodist\"), and 3 [Baptists](/wiki/Baptists\n\"Baptists\").[103][104] The first [Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholic \"Roman\nCatholic\") justice was Roger Taney in 1836,[105] and 1916 saw the appointment\nof the first Jewish justice, [Louis Brandeis](/wiki/Louis_Brandeis \"Louis\nBrandeis\").[106] Several Catholic and Jewish justices have since been\nappointed, and in recent years the situation has reversed. The Court currently\nhas at least five Catholic justices.[99]\n\nRacial, ethnic, and gender diversity began to increase in the late 20th\ncentury.

As retired\njustices, they no longer participate in the work of the Supreme Court, but may\nbe designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts,\nusually the [United States Courts of\nAppeals](/wiki/United_States_Courts_of_Appeals \"United States Courts of\nAppeals\"). Such assignments are formally made by the [Chief\nJustice](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States \"Chief Justice of the United\nStates\"), on request of the [chief judge](/wiki/Chief_Judge \"Chief Judge\") of\nthe lower court and with the consent of the retired justice. In recent years,\nJustice O'Connor has sat with several Courts of Appeals around the country,\nand Justice Souter has frequently sat on the [First\nCircuit](/wiki/First_Circuit \"First Circuit\"), the court of which he was\nbriefly a member before joining the Supreme Court.\n\nThe status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district\ncourt judge who has taken [senior status](/wiki/Senior_status \"Senior\nstatus\"), and eligibility of a supreme court justice to assume retired status\n(rather than simply resign from the bench) is governed by the same age and\nservice criteria.\n\nIn recent times, justices tend to strategically plan their decisions to leave\nthe bench with personal, institutional, ideological, partisan and sometimes\neven political factors playing a role.[109][110] The fear of mental decline\nand death often motivates justices to step down. The desire to maximize the\nCourt's strength and legitimacy through one retirement at a time, when the\nCourt is in recess, and during non-presidential election years suggests a\nconcern for institutional health. Finally, especially in recent decades, many\njustices have timed their departure to coincide with a philosophically\ncompatible president holding office, to ensure that a like-minded successor\nwould be appointed.[111][112]\n\nName | Date of birth | Appointed by | Retired under | Confirmation vote | Age at appointment | Current age | First day | Date of retirement | Length of service  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n[![Stevens](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/John_Paul_Stevens_official_SCOTUS_portrait_crop.jpg/100px-John_Paul_Stevens_official_SCOTUS_portrait_crop.jpg)](/wiki/File:John_Paul_Stevens_official_SCOTUS_portrait_crop.jpg \"Stevens\") **[John Paul Stevens](/wiki/John_Paul_Stevens \"John Paul Stevens\")** | 000000001920-04-20-0000April 20, 1920  \n[Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\"), [Illinois](/wiki/Illinois \"Illinois\") | [Gerald Ford](/wiki/Gerald_Ford \"Gerald Ford\") | [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\") | 98–0 | 55 | 7001970000000000000♠97 | December 19, 1975 | June 29, 2010 | 34 years, 6 months and 10 days  \n[![O'Connor](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor.jpg/100px-Sandra_Day_O%27Connor.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sandra_Day_O%27Connor.jpg \"O'Connor\") **[Sandra Day O'Connor](/wiki/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor \"Sandra Day O'Connor\")** | 000000001930-03-26-0000March 26, 1930  \n[El Paso, Texas](/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas \"El Paso, Texas\") | [Ronald Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan \"Ronald Reagan\") | [George W.

Therefore, the current court sits as follows from left to\nright, from the perspective of those facing the Court: Kagan, Alito, Ginsburg,\nKennedy (most senior Associate Justice), Roberts (Chief Justice), Thomas,\nBreyer, Sotomayor, and Gorsuch. In the official yearly Court photograph,\njustices are arranged similarly, with the five most senior members sitting in\nthe front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions (The\nmost recent photograph includes Ginsburg, Kennedy, Roberts, Thomas, Breyer),\nand the four most junior justices standing behind them, again in the same\norder as they would sit during Court sessions (Kagan, Alito, Sotomayor,\nGorsuch).\n\nIn the justices' private conferences, current practice is for them to speak\nand vote in order of seniority to begin with the chief justice first and end\nwith the most junior associate justice. The most junior associate justice in\nthese conferences is charged with any menial tasks the justices may require as\nthey convene alone, such as answering the door of their conference room,\nserving beverages and transmitting orders of the court to the clerk.[113]\nJustice [Joseph Story](/wiki/Joseph_Story \"Joseph Story\") served the longest\nas junior justice, from February 3, 1812, to September 1, 1823, for a total of\n4,228 days.

Such leanings, however,\ngenerally refer to legal outlook rather than a political or legislative one.\nThe nominations of justices are endorsed by individual politicians in the\nlegislative branch who vote their approval or disapproval of the nominated\njustice.\n\nFollowing the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch in 2017, the Court consists of five\njustices appointed by Republican presidents and four appointed by Democratic\npresidents.

Justice [Kennedy](/wiki/Anthony_Kennedy\n\"Anthony Kennedy\") (appointed by [President Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan\n\"Ronald Reagan\")) is generally considered \"a conservative who has occasionally\nvoted with liberals\",[116] and up until Justice Scalia's death, he was often\nthe [swing vote](/wiki/Swing_vote \"Swing vote\") that determined the outcome of\ncases divided between the conservative and liberal wings.[117][118][119]\nGorsuch had a track record as a reliably conservative judge in the 10th\ncircuit.[120]\n\n[Tom Goldstein](/wiki/Tom_Goldstein \"Tom Goldstein\") argued in an article in\n[SCOTUSblog](/wiki/SCOTUSblog \"SCOTUSblog\") in 2010, that the popular view of\nthe Supreme Court as sharply divided along ideological lines and each side\npushing an agenda at every turn is \"in significant part a caricature designed\nto fit certain preconceptions.\"[121] He pointed out that in the 2009 term,\nalmost half the cases were decided unanimously, and only about 20% were\ndecided by a 5-to-4 vote. Barely one in ten cases involved the narrow\nliberal/conservative divide (fewer if the cases where Sotomayor recused\nherself are not included). He also pointed to several cases that defied the\npopular conception of the ideological lines of the Court.[122] Goldstein\nfurther argued that the large number of pro-criminal-defendant [summary\ndismissals](/wiki/Summary_judgment \"Summary judgment\") (usually cases where\nthe justices decide that the lower courts significantly misapplied precedent\nand reverse the case without briefing or argument) were an illustration that\nthe conservative justices had not been aggressively ideological. Likewise,\nGoldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely\nto invalidate acts of Congress, show inadequate deference to the political\nprocess, and be disrespectful of precedent, also lacked merit: Thomas has most\noften called for overruling prior precedent (even if long standing) that he\nviews as having been wrongly decided, and during the 2009 term Scalia and\nThomas voted most often to invalidate legislation.\n\nAccording to statistics compiled by SCOTUSblog, in the twelve terms from 2000\nto 2011, an average of 19 of the opinions on major issues (22%) were decided\nby a 5–4 vote, with an average of 70% of those split opinions decided by a\nCourt divided along the traditionally perceived ideological lines (about 15%\nof all opinions issued). Over that period, the conservative bloc has been in\nthe majority about 62% of the time that the Court has divided along\nideological lines, which represents about 44% of all the 5–4 decisions.[123]\n\nIn the October 2010 term, the Court decided 86 cases, including 75 signed\nopinions and 5 summary reversals (where the Court reverses a lower court\nwithout arguments and without issuing an opinion on the case).[124][125] Four\nwere decided with unsigned opinions, two cases affirmed by [an equally divided\nCourt](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States#Decision \"Supreme Court of the\nUnited States\"), and two cases were dismissed as improvidently granted.\nJustice Kagan [recused](/wiki/Judicial_disqualification \"Judicial\ndisqualification\") herself from 26 of the cases due to her prior role as\n[United States Solicitor General](/wiki/United_States_Solicitor_General\n\"United States Solicitor General\"). Of the 80 cases, 38 (about 48%, the\nhighest percentage since the October 2005 term) were decided unanimously (9–0\nor 8–0), and 16 decisions were made by a 5–4 vote (about 20%, compared to 18%\nin the October 2009 term, and 29% in the October 2008 term).[126] However, in\nfourteen of the sixteen 5–4 decisions, the Court divided along the traditional\nideological lines (with Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan on the liberal\nside, and Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito on the conservative, and Kennedy\nproviding the \"swing vote\"). This represents 87% of those 16 cases, the\nhighest rate in the past 10 years. The conservative bloc, joined by Kennedy,\nformed the majority in 63% of the 5–4 decisions, the highest cohesion rate of\nthat bloc in the Roberts court.[124][127][128][129][130]\n\nIn the October 2011 term, the Court decided 75 cases. Of these, 33 (44%) were\ndecided unanimously, and 15 (20%, the same percentage as in the previous term)\nwere decided by a vote of 5–4. Of the latter 15, the Court divided along the\nperceived ideological lines 10 times with Justice Kennedy joining the\nconservative justices (Roberts, Scalia, Thomas and Alito) five times and with\nthe liberal justices (Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan) five\ntimes.[123][131][132]\n\nIn the October 2012 term, the Court decided 78 cases. Five of them were\ndecided [in unsigned opinions](/wiki/Per_curiam_decision \"Per curiam\ndecision\"). 38 out of the 78 decisions (representing 49% of the decisions)\nwere unanimous in judgement, with 24 decisions being completely unanimous (a\nsingle opinion with every justice that participated joining it). This was the\nlargest percentage of unanimous decisions that the Court had in ten years,\nsince the October 2002 term (when 51% of the decisions handed down were\nunanimous). The Court split 5–4 in 23 cases (29% of the total); of these, 16\nbroke down along the traditionally perceived ideological lines, with Chief\nJustice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito on one side, Justices\nGinsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan on the other, and Justice Kennedy\nholding the balance. Of these 16 cases, Justice Kennedy sided with the\nconservatives on 10 cases, and with the liberals on 6. Three cases were\ndecided by an interesting alignment of justices, with Chief Justice Roberts\njoined by Justices Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer and Alito in the majority, with\nJustices Scalia, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan in the minority. The greatest\nagreement between justices was between Ginsburg and Kagan, who agreed on 72 of\nthe 75 (96%) cases, in which both voted; the lowest agreement between justices\nwas between Ginsburg and Alito, who agreed only on 45 out of 77 (54%) cases,\nin which they both participated. Justice Kennedy was in the majority of 5–4\ndecisions on 20 out of 24 (83%) cases, and in 71 of 78 (91%) cases during the\nterm, in line with his position as the \"swing vote\" of the Court.[133][134]\n\n##\nFacilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Facilities\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Panorama_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_Building_at_Dusk.jpg/220px-\nPanorama_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_Building_at_Dusk.jpg)](/wiki/File:Panorama_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_Building_at_Dusk.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Panorama_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_Building_at_Dusk.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[The present U.S. Supreme Court\nbuilding](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court_building \"United States Supreme\nCourt building\") as viewed from the front\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b1/SCOTUS-\noldsenate.jpg/220px-SCOTUS-oldsenate.jpg)](/wiki/File:SCOTUS-oldsenate.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:SCOTUS-oldsenate.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFrom the 1860s until the 1930s, the court sat in the [Old Senate\nChamber](/wiki/Old_Senate_Chamber \"Old Senate Chamber\") of the [U.S.\nCapitol](/wiki/U.S._Capitol \"U.S. Capitol\").\n\nMain article: [United States Supreme Court\nBuilding](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court_Building \"United States Supreme\nCourt Building\")\n\nThe Supreme Court first met on February 1, 1790, at the Merchants' Exchange\nBuilding in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"). When\nPhiladelphia became the capital, the Court met briefly in [Independence\nHall](/wiki/Independence_Hall \"Independence Hall\") before settling in [Old\nCity Hall](/wiki/Old_City_Hall_\\(Philadelphia\\) \"Old City Hall\n\\(Philadelphia\\)\") from 1791 until 1800. After the government moved to\nWashington, D.C., the Court occupied various spaces in the [United States\nCapitol](/wiki/United_States_Capitol \"United States Capitol\") building until\n1935, when it moved into its own purpose-built home. The four-story building\nwas designed by [Cass Gilbert](/wiki/Cass_Gilbert \"Cass Gilbert\") in a\nclassical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the\n[Capitol](/wiki/United_States_Capitol \"United States Capitol\") and [Library of\nCongress](/wiki/Library_of_Congress \"Library of Congress\"), and is clad in\nmarble. The building includes the courtroom, justices' chambers, an extensive\n[law library](/wiki/Law_library \"Law library\"), various meeting spaces, and\nauxiliary services including a gymnasium. The Supreme Court building is within\nthe ambit of the [Architect of the Capitol](/wiki/Architect_of_the_Capitol\n\"Architect of the Capitol\"), but maintains its [own police\nforce](/wiki/Supreme_Court_Police \"Supreme Court Police\") separate from the\n[Capitol Police](/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police \"United States Capitol\nPolice\").[135]\n\nLocated across First Street from the [United States\nCapitol](/wiki/United_States_Capitol \"United States Capitol\") at One First\nStreet NE and Maryland Avenue,[136][137] the building is open to the public\nfrom 9 am to 4:30 pm weekdays but closed on weekends and\n[holidays](/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States \"Federal holidays in\nthe United States\").[136] Visitors may not tour the actual courtroom\nunaccompanied. There is a cafeteria, a gift shop, exhibits, and a half-hour\ninformational film.[135] When the Court is not in session, lectures about the\ncourtroom are held hourly from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm and reservations are not\nnecessary.[135] When the Court is in session the public may attend oral\narguments, which are held twice each morning (and sometimes afternoons) on\nMondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays in two-week intervals from October through\nlate April, with breaks during December and February. Visitors are seated on a\nfirst-come first-served basis. One estimate is there are about 250 seats\navailable.[138] The number of open seats varies from case to case; for\nimportant cases, some visitors arrive the day before and wait through the\nnight.

The Supreme Court has\n[original](/wiki/Original_jurisdiction \"Original jurisdiction\") and exclusive\njurisdiction over cases between two or more states,[139] but may decline to\nhear such cases.[140] It also possesses original, but not exclusive,\njurisdiction to hear \"all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors, other\npublic ministers, consuls, or vice consuls of foreign states are parties; all\ncontroversies between the United States and a State; and all actions or\nproceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against\naliens.\"[141]\n\nIn 1906, the Court asserted its original jurisdiction to prosecute individuals\nfor [contempt of court](/wiki/Contempt_of_court \"Contempt of court\") in\n_[United States v. Shipp](/wiki/United_States_v._Shipp \"United States v.\nShipp\")_.[142] The resulting proceeding remains the only contempt proceeding\nand only criminal trial in the Court's history.[143][144] The contempt\nproceeding arose from the [lynching of Ed\nJohnson](/wiki/Lynching_of_Ed_Johnson \"Lynching of Ed Johnson\") in\n[Chattanooga](/wiki/Chattanooga \"Chattanooga\"), [Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee\n\"Tennessee\") the evening after Justice [John Marshall\nHarlan](/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan \"John Marshall Harlan\") granted Johnson a\nstay of execution to allow his lawyers to file an appeal. Johnson was removed\nfrom his jail cell by a lynch mob—aided by the local sheriff who left the\nprison virtually unguarded—and hung from a bridge, after which a deputy\nsheriff pinned a note on Johnson's body reading: \"To Justice Harlan. Come get\nyour nigger now.\"[143] The local sheriff, John Shipp, cited the Supreme\nCourt's intervention as the rationale for the lynching. The Court appointed\nits deputy clerk as [special master](/wiki/Special_master \"Special master\") to\npreside over the trial in Chattanooga with closing arguments made in\nWashington before the Supreme Court justices, who found nine individuals\nguilty of contempt, sentencing three to 90 days in jail and the rest to 60\ndays in jail.[143][144][145]\n\nIn all other cases, however, the Court has only appellate jurisdiction,\nincluding the ability to issue [writs of mandamus](/wiki/Writ_of_mandamus\n\"Writ of mandamus\") and [writs of prohibition](/wiki/Writ_of_prohibition \"Writ\nof prohibition\") to lower courts. It considers cases based on its original\njurisdiction very rarely; almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on\nappeal. In practice, the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the Court\nare disputes between two or more states.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe Court's appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from [federal courts of\nappeal](/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals \"United States courts of\nappeals\") (through [certiorari](/wiki/Certiorari \"Certiorari\"), [certiorari\nbefore judgment](/wiki/Certiorari_before_judgment \"Certiorari before\njudgment\"), and [certified\nquestions](/wiki/Certified_question#Certification_of_questions_to_the_United_States_Supreme_Court\n\"Certified question\")),[146] the [United States Court of Appeals for the Armed\nForces](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Armed_Forces \"United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces\") (through certiorari),[147] the\n[Supreme Court of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Puerto_Rico \"Supreme\nCourt of Puerto Rico\") (through certiorari),[148] the [Supreme Court of the\nVirgin Islands](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Virgin_Islands \"Supreme Court of\nthe Virgin Islands\") (through certiorari),[149] the [District of Columbia\nCourt of Appeals](/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Court_of_Appeals \"District of\nColumbia Court of Appeals\") (through certiorari),[150] and \"final judgments or\ndecrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be\nhad\" (through certiorari).[150] In the last case, an appeal may be made to the\nSupreme Court from a lower state court if the state's highest court declined\nto hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal. For example, a\ndecision rendered by one of the [Florida District Courts of\nAppeal](/wiki/Florida_District_Courts_of_Appeal \"Florida District Courts of\nAppeal\") can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court if (a) the [Supreme Court\nof Florida](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Florida \"Supreme Court of Florida\")\ndeclined to grant certiorari, e.g. _[Florida Star v. B. J.\nF.](/wiki/Florida_Star_v._B._J._F. \"Florida Star v. B. J. F.\")_ , or (b) the\ndistrict court of appeal issued a [per curiam](/wiki/Per_curiam_decision \"Per\ncuriam decision\") decision simply affirming the lower court's decision without\ndiscussing the merits of the case, since the Supreme Court of Florida lacks\njurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions.[151] The power of the Supreme\nCourt to consider appeals from state courts, rather than just federal courts,\nwas created by the [Judiciary Act of 1789](/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789\n\"Judiciary Act of 1789\") and upheld early in the Court's history, by its\nrulings in _[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee](/wiki/Martin_v._Hunter%27s_Lessee\n\"Martin v. Hunter's Lessee\")_ (1816) and _[Cohens v.\nVirginia](/wiki/Cohens_v._Virginia \"Cohens v. Virginia\")_ (1821). The Supreme\nCourt is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from\nstate court decisions, although there are several devices that permit so-\ncalled \"collateral review\" of state cases. It has to be noted that this\n\"collateral review\" often only applies to individuals on death row and not\nthrough the regular judicial system.[152]\n\nSince Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that federal\ncourts may only entertain \"cases\" or \"controversies\", the Supreme Court cannot\ndecide cases that are moot and it does not render [advisory\nopinions](/wiki/Advisory_opinion \"Advisory opinion\"), as the supreme courts of\nsome states may do. For example, in _[DeFunis v.\nOdegaard](/wiki/DeFunis_v._Odegaard \"DeFunis v. Odegaard\")_ ,\n[416](/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_416 \"List of\nUnited States Supreme Court cases, volume 416\")\n[U.S.](/wiki/United_States_Reports \"United States Reports\")\n[312](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/416/312/) (1974), the Court\ndismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school\naffirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he\nbegan the lawsuit, and a decision from the Court on his claim would not be\nable to redress any injury he had suffered. However, the Court recognizes some\ncircumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot.\nIf an issue is \"capable of repetition yet evading review\", the Court will\naddress it even though the party before the Court would not himself be made\nwhole by a favorable result. In _Roe v. Wade_ ,\n[410](/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_410 \"List of\nUnited States Supreme Court cases, volume 410\")\n[U.S.](/wiki/United_States_Reports \"United States Reports\")\n[113](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/) (1973), and other\nabortion cases, the Court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant\nwomen seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes\nlonger than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the\nlower courts to the Supreme Court. Another mootness exception is voluntary\ncessation of unlawful conduct, in which the Court considers the probability of\nrecurrence and plaintiff's need for relief.[153]\n\n### Justices as Circuit\nJustices[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Justices as Circuit Justices\")]\n\nThe United States is divided into thirteen [circuit courts of\nappeals](/wiki/United_States_court_of_appeals \"United States court of\nappeals\"), each of which is assigned a \"circuit justice\" from the Supreme\nCourt. Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the\nhistory of the republic, its meaning has changed through time.\n\nUnder the [Judiciary Act of 1789](/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789 \"Judiciary Act\nof 1789\"), each justice was required to \"ride circuit\", or to travel within\nthe assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges. This practice\nencountered opposition from many justices, who cited the difficulty of travel.\nMoreover, there was a potential for a conflict of interest on the Court if a\njustice had previously decided the same case while riding circuit. Circuit\nriding was abolished in 1891.\n\nToday, the circuit justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing with\ncertain types of applications that, under the Court's rules, may be addressed\nby a single justice. These include applications for emergency stays (including\nstays of execution in death-penalty cases) and injunctions pursuant to the\n[All Writs Act](/wiki/All_Writs_Act \"All Writs Act\") arising from cases within\nthat circuit, as well as routine requests such as requests for extensions of\ntime. In the past, circuit justices also sometimes ruled on motions for\n[bail](/wiki/Bail \"Bail\") in criminal cases, writs of [habeas\ncorpus](/wiki/Habeas_corpus \"Habeas corpus\"), and applications for [writs of\nerror](/wiki/Writ_of_error \"Writ of error\") granting permission to appeal.\nOrdinarily, a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it\n\"granted\" or \"denied\" or entering a standard form of order. However, the\njustice may elect to write an opinion—referred to as an [in-chambers\nopinion](/wiki/In-chambers_opinion \"In-chambers opinion\")—in such matters if\nhe or she wishes.\n\nA circuit justice may sit as a judge on the [Court of\nAppeals](/wiki/Court_of_Appeals \"Court of Appeals\") of that circuit, but over\nthe past hundred years, this has rarely occurred. A circuit justice sitting\nwith the Court of Appeals has seniority over the chief judge of the circuit.\n\nThe chief justice has traditionally been assigned to the District of Columbia\nCircuit, the Fourth Circuit (which includes Maryland and Virginia, the states\nsurrounding the District of Columbia), and since it was established, the\n[Federal Circuit](/wiki/Federal_Circuit \"Federal Circuit\"). Each associate\njustice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits.\n\nAs of June 27, 2017, the allotment of the justices among the circuits is:[154]\n\nCircuit | Justice  \n---|---  \n[District of Columbia Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\") | Chief Justice Roberts  \n[First Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_First_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\") | Justice Breyer  \n[Second Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\") | Justice Ginsburg  \n[Third Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Third_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\") | Justice Alito  \n[Fourth Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\") | Chief Justice Roberts  \n[Fifth Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fifth_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\") | Justice Alito  \n[Sixth Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Sixth_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\") | Justice Kagan  \n[Seventh Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Seventh_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\") | Justice Kagan  \n[Eighth Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eighth_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\") | Justice Gorsuch  \n[Ninth Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\") | Justice Kennedy  \n[Tenth Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Tenth_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\") | Justice Sotomayor  \n[Eleventh Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\") | Justice Thomas  \n[Federal Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\") | Chief Justice Roberts  \n  \nFour of the current justices are assigned to circuits on which they previously\nsat as circuit judges: Chief Justice Roberts (D.C. Circuit), Justice Breyer\n(First Circuit), Justice Alito (Third Circuit), and Justice Kennedy (Ninth\nCircuit).\n\n##\nProcess[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Process\")]\n\nMain article: [Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United\nStates](/wiki/Procedures_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Procedures\nof the Supreme Court of the United States\")\n\nA term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October, and\ncontinues until June or early July of the following year. Each term consists\nof alternating periods of around two weeks known as \"sittings\" and \"recesses.\"\nJustices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings; they discuss cases\nand write opinions during recesses.\n\n### Case\nselection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Case selection\")]\n\nNearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of\n[certiorari](/wiki/Certiorari#United_States_law \"Certiorari\"), commonly\nreferred to as \"cert\". The Court may review any case in the federal courts of\nappeals \"by writ of _certiorari_ granted upon the petition of any party to any\ncivil or criminal case.\"[155] Court may only review \"final judgments rendered\nby the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had\" if those\njudgments involve a question of federal statutory or constitutional law.[156]\nThe party that appealed to the Court is the _[petitioner](/wiki/Petitioner\n\"Petitioner\")_ and the non-mover is the _[respondent](/wiki/Defendant\n\"Defendant\")_. All case names before the Court are styled _petitioner_ v.\n_respondent_ , regardless of which party initiated the lawsuit in the trial\ncourt. For example, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state\nand against an individual, as in _State of Arizona v. Ernesto Miranda_. If the\ndefendant is convicted, and his conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the\n[state supreme court](/wiki/State_supreme_court \"State supreme court\"), when\nhe petitions for cert the name of the case becomes _[Miranda v.\nArizona](/wiki/Miranda_v._Arizona \"Miranda v. Arizona\")_.\n\nThere are situations where the Court has original jurisdiction, such as when\ntwo states have a dispute against each other, or when there is a dispute\nbetween the United States and a state. In such instances, a case is filed with\nthe Supreme Court directly. Examples of such cases include _[United States v.\nTexas](/wiki/United_States_v._Texas \"United States v. Texas\")_ , a case to\ndetermine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas,\nand _[Virginia v. Tennessee](/wiki/Virginia_v._Tennessee \"Virginia v.\nTennessee\")_ , a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between\ntwo states can be changed by a state court, and whether the setting of the\ncorrect boundary requires Congressional approval. Although it has not happened\nsince 1794 in the case of _[Georgia v.\nBrailsford](/wiki/Georgia_v._Brailsford_\\(1794\\) \"Georgia v. Brailsford\n\\(1794\\)\")_ ,[157] parties in an action at law in which the Supreme Court has\noriginal jurisdiction may request that a [jury](/wiki/Jury \"Jury\") determine\nissues of fact.[158] Two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial\nera borders and rights under navigable waters in _[New Jersey v.\nDelaware](/wiki/New_Jersey_v._Delaware \"New Jersey v. Delaware\")_ , and water\nrights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in _[Kansas v.\nColorado](/wiki/Kansas_v._Colorado \"Kansas v. Colorado\")_.\n\nA cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called a _conference_. A\nconference is a private meeting of the nine Justices by themselves; the public\nand the Justices' clerks are excluded. The [rule of four](/wiki/Rule_of_four\n\"Rule of four\") permits four of the nine justices to grant a writ of\ncertiorari. If it is granted, the case proceeds to the briefing stage;\notherwise, the case ends. Except in [death penalty](/wiki/Death_penalty \"Death\npenalty\") cases and other cases in which the Court orders briefing from the\nrespondent, the respondent may, but is not required to, file a response to the\ncert petition.\n\nThe court grants a petition for cert only for \"compelling reasons\", spelled\nout in the court's Rule 10. Such reasons include:\n\n  * Resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or a provision of the federal Constitution\n  * Correcting an egregious departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings\n  * Resolving an important question of federal law, or to expressly review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a previous decision of the Court.\n\nWhen a conflict of interpretations arises from differing interpretations of\nthe same law or constitutional provision issued by different federal circuit\ncourts of appeals, lawyers call this situation a \"circuit split.\" If the court\nvotes to deny a cert petition, as it does in the vast majority of such\npetitions that come before it, it does so typically without comment. A denial\nof a cert petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case, and the decision\nof the lower court stands as the final ruling in the case.\n\nTo manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the Court each year\n(of the more than 7,000 petitions the Court receives each year, it will\nusually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer), the Court\nemploys an internal case management tool known as the \"[cert\npool](/wiki/Cert_pool \"Cert pool\").\" Currently, all justices except for\nJustices Alito and Gorsuch participate in the cert pool.[159][160][161] [162]\n\n### Oral\nargument[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Oral argument\")]\n\nWhen the Court grants a cert petition, the case is set for oral argument. Both\nparties will file briefs on the merits of the case, as distinct from the\nreasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition. With\nthe consent of the parties or approval of the Court, _[amici\ncuriae](/wiki/Amicus_curiae \"Amicus curiae\")_ , or \"friends of the court\", may\nalso file briefs. The Court holds two-week oral argument sessions each month\nfrom October through April. Each side has thirty minutes to present its\nargument (the Court may choose to give more time, though this is rare),[163]\nand during that time, the Justices may interrupt the advocate and ask\nquestions. The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some\ntime to rebut the respondent's arguments after the respondent has concluded.\n_Amici curiae_ may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that\nparty agrees. The Court advises counsel to assume that the Justices are\nfamiliar with and have read the briefs filed in a case.\n\n### Supreme Court\nbar[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Supreme Court bar\")]\n\nIn order to plead before the court, an attorney must first be admitted to the\ncourt's bar. Approximately 4,000 lawyers join the bar each year. The bar\ncontains an estimated 230,000 members. In reality, pleading is limited to\nseveral hundred attorneys. The rest join for a one-time fee of $200, earning\nthe court about $750,000 annually. Attorneys can be admitted as either\nindividuals or as groups. The group admission is held before the current\njustices of the Supreme Court, wherein the Chief Justice approves a motion to\nadmit the new attorneys.[164] Lawyers commonly apply for the cosmetic value of\na certificate to display in their office or on their resume. They also receive\naccess to better seating if they wish to attend an oral argument.[165] Members\nof the Supreme Court Bar are also granted access to the collections of the\nSupreme Court Library.[166]\n\n###\nDecision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Decision\")]\n\nAt the conclusion of oral argument, the case is submitted for decision. Cases\nare decided by majority vote of the Justices. It is the Court's practice to\nissue decisions in all cases argued in a particular Term by the end of that\nTerm. Within that Term, however, the Court is under no obligation to release a\ndecision within any set time after oral argument. At the conclusion of oral\nargument, the Justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary\nvotes are tallied, and the most senior Justice in the majority assigns the\ninitial draft of the Court's opinion to a Justice on his or her side. Drafts\nof the Court's opinion, as well as any [concurring](/wiki/Concurring_opinion\n\"Concurring opinion\") or [dissenting opinions](/wiki/Dissenting_opinion\n\"Dissenting opinion\"),[167] circulate among the Justices until the Court is\nprepared to announce the judgment in a particular case. Since recording\ndevices are banned inside the courtroom of the [United States Supreme Court\nBuilding](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court_Building \"United States Supreme\nCourt Building\"), the delivery of the decision to the media is done via paper\ncopies and is known as the [Running of the\nInterns](/wiki/Running_of_the_Interns \"Running of the Interns\").[168][169]\n\nIt is possible that, through recusals or vacancies, the Court divides evenly\non a case. If that occurs, then the decision of the court below is affirmed,\nbut does not establish binding precedent. In effect, it results in a return to\nthe _[status quo](/wiki/Status_quo \"Status quo\") ante_. For a case to be\nheard, there must be a quorum of at least six justices.[170] If a quorum is\nnot available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes\nthat the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term, then the\njudgment of the court below is affirmed as if the Court had been evenly\ndivided. For cases brought to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a United\nStates District Court, the Chief Justice may order the case remanded to the\nappropriate U.S. Court of Appeals for a final decision there.[171] This has\nonly occurred once in U.S. history, in the case of _[United States v.\nAlcoa](/wiki/United_States_v._Alcoa \"United States v. Alcoa\")_ (1945).[172]\n\n### Published\nopinions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Published opinions\")]\n\nThe Court's opinions are published in three stages. First, a slip opinion is\nmade available on the Court's web site and through other outlets. Next,\nseveral opinions and lists of the court's orders are bound together in\npaperback form, called a preliminary print of _[United States\nReports](/wiki/United_States_Reports \"United States Reports\")_ , the official\nseries of books in which the final version of the Court's opinions appears.\nAbout a year after the preliminary prints are issued, a final bound volume of\n_U.S. Reports_ is issued. The individual volumes of _U.S. Reports_ are\nnumbered so that users may cite this set of reports—or a competing version\npublished by another commercial legal publisher but containing parallel\ncitations—to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the\ncases quickly and easily.\n\nAs of the beginning of October Term\n2016[[ref]](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/boundvolumes.aspx), there\nare:\n\n  * 564 final bound volumes of _U.S. Reports_ , covering cases through the end of October Term 2010, which ended on September 28, 2011.[173]\n  * 16 volumes' worth of opinions available in [slip opinion](/wiki/Slip_opinion \"Slip opinion\") form (volumes 565–580)[174]\n\nAs of March\n2012[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit),\nthe _U.S. Reports_ have published a total of 30,161 Supreme Court opinions,\ncovering the decisions handed down from February 1790 to March\n2012.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] This figure does not reflect the number of cases the Court has\ntaken up, as several cases can be addressed by a single opinion (see, for\nexample, _[Parents v.\nSeattle](/wiki/Parents_Involved_in_Community_Schools_v._Seattle_School_District_No._1\n\"Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1\")_ ,\nwhere _[Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of\nEducation](/wiki/Meredith_v._Jefferson_County_Board_of_Education \"Meredith v.\nJefferson County Board of Education\")_ was also decided in the same opinion;\nby a similar logic, _[Miranda v. Arizona](/wiki/Miranda_v._Arizona \"Miranda v.\nArizona\")_ actually decided not only _Miranda_ but also three other cases:\n_Vignera v. New York_ , _Westover v. United States_ , and _California v.\nStewart_). A more unusual example is [The Telephone\nCases](/wiki/The_Telephone_Cases \"The Telephone Cases\"), which comprise a\nsingle set of interlinked opinions that take up the entire 126th volume of the\n_U.S. Reports_.\n\nOpinions are also collected and published in two unofficial, parallel\nreporters: _[Supreme Court Reporter](/wiki/Supreme_Court_Reporter \"Supreme\nCourt Reporter\")_ , published by [West](/wiki/West_\\(publisher\\) \"West\n\\(publisher\\)\") (now a part of [Thomson Reuters](/wiki/Thomson_Reuters\n\"Thomson Reuters\")), and _[United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers'\nEdition](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court_Reports,_Lawyers%27_Edition \"United\nStates Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition\")_ (simply known as _Lawyers '\nEdition_), published by [LexisNexis](/wiki/LexisNexis \"LexisNexis\"). In court\ndocuments, legal periodicals and other legal media, case citations generally\ncontain cites from each of the three reporters; for example, citation to\n_[Citizens United v. Federal Election\nCommission](/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission \"Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Commission\")_ is presented as _Citizens United v.\nFederal Election Com 'n_, 585 U.S. 50, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753\n(2010), with \"S. Ct.\" representing the _Supreme Court Reporter_ , and \"L. Ed.\"\nrepresenting the _Lawyers ' Edition_.[175][176]\n\n#### Citations to published\nopinions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Citations to published opinions\")]\n\nMain article: [Case citation § Supreme Court of the United\nStates](/wiki/Case_citation#Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Case\ncitation\")\n\nLawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases, in the form \"vol U.S. page,\npin (year)\", where vol is the volume number, page is the page number on which\nthe opinion begins, and year is the year in which the case was decided.\nOptionally, pin is used to \"pinpoint\" to a specific page number within the\nopinion. For instance, the citation for _Roe v. Wade_ is 410 U.S. 113 (1973),\nwhich means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410\nof _U.S. Reports_.

little attention in the debates over the drafting and\nratification of the Constitution. The power of [judicial\nreview](/wiki/Judicial_review \"Judicial review\"), in fact, is nowhere\nmentioned in it. Over the ensuing years, the question of whether the power of\njudicial review was even intended by the drafters of the Constitution was\nquickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either\nway.[177] Nevertheless, the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive\nactions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well-established\nprecedent. Many of the [Founding Fathers](/wiki/Founding_Fathers \"Founding\nFathers\") accepted the notion of judicial review; in [Federalist No.\n78](/wiki/Federalist_No._78 \"Federalist No. 78\"), [Alexander\nHamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\") wrote: \"A\nConstitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental\nlaw. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the\nmeaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there\nshould happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has\nthe superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in\nother words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court firmly established its power to declare laws\nunconstitutional in _[Marbury v. Madison](/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison \"Marbury v.\nMadison\")_ (1803), consummating the American system of [checks and\nbalances](/wiki/Checks_and_balances \"Checks and balances\"). In explaining the\npower of judicial review, Chief Justice [John Marshall](/wiki/John_Marshall\n\"John Marshall\") stated that the authority to interpret the law was the\nparticular province of the courts, part of the _duty of the judicial\ndepartment to say what the law is._ His contention was not that the Court had\nprivileged insight into constitutional requirements, but that it was the\nconstitutional duty of the judiciary, as well as the other branches of\ngovernment, to read and obey the dictates of the Constitution.[177]\n\nSince the founding of the republic, there has been a tension between the\npractice of judicial review and the [democratic\nideals](/wiki/Democratic_ideals \"Democratic ideals\") of egalitarianism, self-\ngovernment, self-determination and freedom of conscience. At one pole are\nthose who view the Federal Judiciary and especially the Supreme Court as being\n\"the most separated and least checked of all branches of government.\"[178]\nIndeed, federal judges and justices on the Supreme Court are not required to\nstand for election by virtue of their tenure \"during good behavior\", and their\npay may \"not be diminished\" while they hold their position ([Section 1 of\nArticle\nThree](/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_1:_Federal_courts\n\"Article Three of the United States Constitution\")). Though subject to the\nprocess of impeachment, only one Justice has ever been impeached and no\nSupreme Court Justice has been removed from office. At the other pole are\nthose who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch, with little\nability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government.[177]\nThe Supreme Court, it is noted, cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead,\nit relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its\njudgments. One notable instance of [nonacquiescence](/wiki/Nonacquiescence\n\"Nonacquiescence\") came in 1832, when the state of\n[Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_\\(U.S._state\\) \"Georgia \\(U.S. state\\)\") ignored the\nSupreme Court's decision in _[Worcester v. Georgia](/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia\n\"Worcester v. Georgia\")_. President [Andrew Jackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson\n\"Andrew Jackson\"), who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have\nremarked, \"[John Marshall](/wiki/John_Marshall \"John Marshall\") has made his\ndecision; now let him enforce it!\";[179] however, this alleged quotation has\nbeen disputed. Some state governments in the\n[South](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\") also resisted\nthe desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment _[Brown v. Board\nof Education](/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education \"Brown v. Board of\nEducation\")_. More recently, many feared that President Nixon would refuse to\ncomply with the Court's order in _[United States v.\nNixon](/wiki/United_States_v._Nixon \"United States v. Nixon\")_ (1974) to\nsurrender the [Watergate tapes](/wiki/Watergate_tapes \"Watergate tapes\").\nNixon, however, ultimately complied with the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nSupreme Court decisions can be (and have been) purposefully overturned by\nconstitutional amendment, which has happened on five occasions:\n\n  * _[Chisholm v. Georgia](/wiki/Chisholm_v._Georgia \"Chisholm v. Georgia\")_ (1793) – overturned by the [Eleventh Amendment](/wiki/Eleventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution\") (1795)\n  * _[Dred Scott v. Sandford](/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford \"Dred Scott v.

Goodyear Tire&\nRubber Co.](/wiki/Ledbetter_v._Goodyear_Tire_%26_Rubber_Co. \"Ledbetter v.\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co.\")_ in 2007). Also, the Supreme Court is not immune\nfrom political and institutional consideration: lower federal courts and state\ncourts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations, as do law enforcement\nofficials.[180]\n\nIn addition, the other two branches can restrain the Court through other\nmechanisms. Congress can increase the number of justices, giving the President\npower to influence future decisions by appointments (as in Roosevelt's Court\nPacking Plan discussed above). Congress can pass legislation that restricts\nthe jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other federal courts over certain\ntopics and cases: this is suggested by language in [Section\n2](/wiki/Article_3_\\(U.S._Constitution\\)#Section_2:_Federal_jurisdiction_and_trial_by_jury\n\"Article 3 \\(U.S. Constitution\\)\") of Article Three, where the appellate\njurisdiction is granted _\" with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as\nthe Congress shall make.\"_ The Court sanctioned such congressional action in\nthe [Reconstruction](/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States\n\"Reconstruction era of the United States\") case _[ex parte\nMcCardle](/wiki/Ex_parte_McCardle \"Ex parte McCardle\")_ (1869), though it\nrejected Congress' power to dictate how particular cases must be decided in\n_[United States v. Klein](/wiki/United_States_v._Klein \"United States v.\nKlein\")_ (1871).\n\nOn the other hand, through its power of judicial review, the Supreme Court has\ndefined the scope and nature of the powers and separation between the\nlegislative and executive branches of the federal government; for example, in\n_[United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export\nCorp.](/wiki/United_States_v._Curtiss-Wright_Export_Corp. \"United States v.\nCurtiss-Wright Export Corp.\")_ (1936), _[Dames& Moore v.\nRegan](/wiki/Dames_%26_Moore_v._Regan \"Dames & Moore v. Regan\")_ (1981), and\nnotably in _[Goldwater v. Carter](/wiki/Goldwater_v._Carter \"Goldwater v.\nCarter\")_ (1979), (where it effectively gave the Presidency the power to\nterminate ratified treaties without the consent of Congress or the Senate).\nThe Court's decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of Executive\nauthority, as in _[Humphrey's Executor v. United\nStates](/wiki/Humphrey%27s_Executor_v._United_States \"Humphrey's Executor v.\nUnited States\")_ (1935), the _[Steel Seizure\nCase](/wiki/Youngstown_Sheet_%26_Tube_Co._v._Sawyer \"Youngstown Sheet & Tube\nCo. v.

Associate justices are\nallowed four clerks. The chief justice is allowed five clerks, but Chief\nJustice Rehnquist hired only three per year, and Chief Justice Roberts usually\nhires only four.[181] Generally, law clerks serve a term of one to two years.\n\nThe first law clerk was hired by Associate Justice [Horace\nGray](/wiki/Horace_Gray \"Horace Gray\") in 1882.[181][182] [Oliver Wendell\nHolmes, Jr.](/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Jr. \"Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\")\nand [Louis Brandeis](/wiki/Louis_Brandeis \"Louis Brandeis\") were the first\nSupreme Court justices to use recent [law school](/wiki/Law_school \"Law\nschool\") graduates as clerks, rather than hiring a \"stenographer-\nsecretary\".[183] Most law clerks are recent law school graduates.\n\nThe first female clerk was [Lucile Lomen](/wiki/Lucile_Lomen \"Lucile Lomen\"),\nhired in 1944 by Justice [William O. Douglas](/wiki/William_O._Douglas\n\"William O. Douglas\").[181] The first African-American, [William T. Coleman,\nJr.](/wiki/William_T._Coleman,_Jr. \"William T. Coleman, Jr.\"), was hired in\n1948 by Justice [Felix Frankfurter](/wiki/Felix_Frankfurter \"Felix\nFrankfurter\").[181] A disproportionately large number of law clerks have\nobtained law degrees from elite law schools, especially Harvard, Yale, the\nUniversity of Chicago, Columbia, and Stanford. From 1882 to 1940, 62% of law\nclerks were graduates of Harvard Law School.[181] Those chosen to be Supreme\nCourt law clerks usually have graduated in the top of their law school class\nand were often an editor of the [law review](/wiki/Law_review \"Law review\") or\na member of the [moot court](/wiki/Moot_court \"Moot court\") board. By the\nmid-1970s, clerking previously for a judge in a [federal court of\nappeals](/wiki/United_States_Courts_of_Appeals \"United States Courts of\nAppeals\") had also become a prerequisite to clerking for a Supreme Court\njustice.[184]\n\nSeven Supreme Court justices previously clerked for other justices: [Byron\nWhite](/wiki/Byron_White \"Byron White\") for [Frederick M.\nVinson](/wiki/Frederick_M._Vinson \"Frederick M.

Gorsuch is the first\njustice to serve alongside a justice for whom he or she clerked.\n\nSeveral current Supreme Court justices have also clerked in the federal courts\nof appeals: [John G. Roberts, Jr.](/wiki/John_G._Roberts,_Jr. \"John G.\nRoberts, Jr.\") for Judge [Henry Friendly](/wiki/Henry_Friendly \"Henry\nFriendly\") of the [United States Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit \"United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\"), Justice [Samuel\nAlito](/wiki/Samuel_Alito \"Samuel Alito\") for Judge [Leonard I.\nGarth](/wiki/Leonard_I._Garth \"Leonard I.

Three-quarters said justices' decisions\nare sometimes influenced by their political or personal views.[187]\n\n##\nCriticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Criticism\")]\n\nThe court has been the object of criticisms on a range of issues. Among them:\n\n### Judicial\nactivism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Judicial activism\")]\n\nThe Supreme Court has been criticized for not keeping within Constitutional\nbounds by engaging in [judicial activism](/wiki/Judicial_activism \"Judicial\nactivism\"), rather than merely interpreting law and exercising [judicial\nrestraint](/wiki/Judicial_restraint \"Judicial restraint\"). Claims of judicial\nactivism are not confined to any particular ideology.[188] An often cited\nexample of [conservative](/wiki/Conservatism \"Conservatism\") judicial activism\nis the 1905 decision in _[Lochner v. New York](/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York\n\"Lochner v. New York\")_ , which has been criticized by many prominent\nthinkers, including [Robert Bork](/wiki/Robert_Bork \"Robert Bork\"), Justice\n[Antonin Scalia](/wiki/Antonin_Scalia \"Antonin Scalia\"), and Chief Justice\n[John Roberts](/wiki/John_Roberts \"John Roberts\"),[188][189] and which was\nreversed in the 1930s.[190][191][192] An often cited example of\n[liberal](/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States \"Modern liberalism in\nthe United States\") judicial activism is _[Roe v. Wade](/wiki/Roe_v._Wade \"Roe\nv. Wade\")_ (1973), which legalized abortion in part on the basis of the \"right\nto privacy\" inferred from the [Fourteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), a reasoning that\nsome critics argued was circuitous.[188] Legal scholars,[193][194]\njustices,[195] and presidential candidates[196] have criticized the Roe\ndecision. The progressive _[Brown v. Board of\nEducation](/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education \"Brown v. Board of Education\")_\ndecision has been criticized by conservatives such as [Patrick\nBuchanan](/wiki/Patrick_Buchanan \"Patrick Buchanan\")[197] and former\npresidential contender [Barry Goldwater](/wiki/Barry_Goldwater \"Barry\nGoldwater\").[198] More recently, _[Citizens United v. Federal Election\nCommission](/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission \"Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Commission\")_ was criticized for expanding upon the\nprecedent in _[First National Bank of Boston v.\nBellotti](/wiki/First_National_Bank_of_Boston_v._Bellotti \"First National Bank\nof Boston v. Bellotti\")_ (1978) that the [First\nAmendment](/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") applies to corporations.[199]\n[Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\") warned, referring to the\n_[Dred Scott](/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford \"Dred Scott v.

Sutherland,[210] and\n[James MacGregor Burns](/wiki/James_MacGregor_Burns \"James MacGregor\nBurns\").[211][212] Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial\nactivism, including [Franklin D. Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt\n\"Franklin D. Roosevelt\"), Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan.[213][214] Failed\nSupreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: \"What judges have wrought is a coup\nd'état, – slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless.\"[215]\nSenator [Al Franken](/wiki/Al_Franken \"Al Franken\") quipped that when\npoliticians talk about judicial activism, \"their definition of an activist\njudge is one who votes differently than they would like.\"[216] One law\nprofessor claimed in a 1978 article that the Supreme Court is in some respects\n\"certainly a legislative body.\"[217]\n\n### Failing to protect individual\nrights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Failing to protect individual rights\")]\n\nCourt decisions have been criticized for failing to protect individual rights:\nthe _[Dred Scott](/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford \"Dred Scott v.

For example,\nChief Justice [Warren Burger](/wiki/Warren_Burger \"Warren Burger\") was an\noutspoken critic of the exclusionary rule, and Justice\n[Scalia](/wiki/Antonin_Scalia \"Antonin Scalia\") criticized the Court's\ndecision in _[Boumediene v.

[George\nWill](/wiki/George_Will \"George Will\") wrote that the Court has an\n\"increasingly central role in American governance.\"[224] It was criticized for\nintervening in bankruptcy proceedings regarding ailing carmaker [Chrysler\nCorporation](/wiki/Chrysler_Corporation \"Chrysler Corporation\") in 2009.[225]\nA reporter wrote that \"Justice [Ruth Bader Ginsburg](/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg\n\"Ruth Bader Ginsburg\")'s intervention in the Chrysler bankruptcy\" left open\nthe \"possibility of further judicial review\" but argued overall that the\nintervention was a proper use of Supreme Court power to check the executive\nbranch.[225] Warren E. Burger, before becoming [Chief\nJustice](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States \"Chief Justice of the United\nStates\"), argued that since the Supreme Court has such \"unreviewable power\" it\nis likely to \"self-indulge itself\" and unlikely to \"engage in dispassionate\nanalysis\".[226] [Larry Sabato](/wiki/Larry_Sabato \"Larry Sabato\") wrote\n\"excessive authority has accrued to the federal courts, especially the Supreme\nCourt.\"[227]\n\n### Courts are poor check on executive\npower[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=36\n\"Edit section: Courts are poor check on executive power\")]\n\nBritish constitutional scholar [Adam Tomkins](/wiki/Adam_Tomkins \"Adam\nTomkins\") sees flaws in the American system of having courts (and specifically\nthe Supreme Court) act as checks on the Executive and Legislative branches; he\nargues that because the courts must wait, sometimes for years, for cases to\nnavigate their way through the system, their ability to restrain other\nbranches is severely weakened.[228][229] In contrast, the [Federal\nConstitutional Court of Germany](/wiki/Federal_Constitutional_Court_of_Germany\n\"Federal Constitutional Court of Germany\") for example, can directly declare a\nlaw unconstitutional upon request.\n\n### Federal versus state\npower[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=37\n\"Edit section: Federal versus state power\")]\n\nThere has been debate throughout American history about the boundary between\nfederal and state power. While Framers such as [James\nMadison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\")[230] and [Alexander\nHamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\")[231] argued in _[The\nFederalist Papers](/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers \"The Federalist Papers\")_ that\ntheir then-proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state\ngovernments,[232][233][234][235] others argue that expansive [federal\npower](/wiki/Federal_power \"Federal power\") is good and consistent with the\nFramers' wishes.[236] The [Tenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution](/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Tenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") explicitly grants \"powers not\ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to\nthe States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" The\nSupreme Court has been criticized for giving the [federal\ngovernment](/wiki/Federal_Government_of_the_United_States \"Federal Government\nof the United States\") too much power to interfere with state authority. One\ncriticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the\n[Commerce Clause](/wiki/Commerce_Clause \"Commerce Clause\") by upholding\nregulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce,\nbut that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce; and\nby voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate\ncommerce. For example, the Commerce Clause was used by the Fifth Circuit Court\nof Appeals to uphold the Endangered Species Act, thus protecting six endemic\nspecies of insect near Austin, Texas, despite the fact that the insects had no\ncommercial value and did not travel across state lines; the Supreme Court let\nthat ruling stand without comment in 2005.[237] Chief Justice [John\nMarshall](/wiki/John_Marshall \"John Marshall\") asserted Congress's power over\ninterstate commerce was \"complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost\nextent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the\nConstitution.\"[238] Justice [Alito](/wiki/Samuel_Alito \"Samuel Alito\") said\ncongressional authority under the [Commerce Clause](/wiki/Commerce_Clause\n\"Commerce Clause\") is \"quite broad.\"[239] Modern day theorist [Robert B.\nReich](/wiki/Robert_B._Reich \"Robert B.

Justice [Brandeis](/wiki/Louis_Brandeis \"Louis Brandeis\"), in\narguing for allowing the states to operate without federal interference,\nsuggested that states should be [laboratories of\ndemocracy](/wiki/Laboratories_of_democracy \"Laboratories of democracy\").[240]\nOne critic wrote \"the great majority of Supreme Court rulings of\nunconstitutionality involve state, not federal, law.\"[241] However, others see\nthe [Fourteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") as a positive force\nthat extends \"protection of those rights and guarantees to the state\nlevel.\"[242]\n\n### Secretive\nproceedings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=38\n\"Edit section: Secretive proceedings\")]\n\nThe Court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public\nview.[243] According to a review of [Jeffrey Toobin](/wiki/Jeffrey_Toobin\n\"Jeffrey Toobin\")'s expose _[The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/The_Nine:_Inside_the_Secret_World_of_the_Supreme_Court \"The Nine:\nInside the Secret World of the Supreme Court\")_ ; \"Its inner workings are\ndifficult for reporters to cover, like a closed \"cartel\", only revealing\nitself through \"public events and printed releases, with nothing about its\ninner workings\".[244] The reviewer writes: \"few (reporters) dig deeply into\ncourt affairs. It all works very neatly; the only ones hurt are the American\npeople, who know little about nine individuals with enormous power over their\nlives.\"[244] [Larry Sabato](/wiki/Larry_Sabato \"Larry Sabato\") complains about\nthe Court's \"insularity.\"[227] A [Fairleigh Dickinson\nUniversity](/wiki/Fairleigh_Dickinson_University \"Fairleigh Dickinson\nUniversity\") poll conducted in 2010 found that 61% of American voters agreed\nthat [televising Court\nhearings](/wiki/Cameras_in_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Cameras in\nthe Supreme Court of the United States\") would \"be good for democracy\", and\n50% of voters stated they would watch Court proceedings if they were\ntelevised.[245][246] In recent years, many justices have appeared on\ntelevision, written books and made public statements to journalists.[247][248]\nIn a 2009 interview on _C-SPAN_ , journalists [Joan\nBiskupic](/wiki/Joan_Biskupic \"Joan Biskupic\") (of _[USA\nToday](/wiki/USA_Today \"USA Today\")_) and [Lyle\nDenniston](/wiki/Lyle_Denniston \"Lyle Denniston\") (of\n_[SCOTUSblog](/wiki/SCOTUSblog \"SCOTUSblog\")_) argued that the Court is a\n\"very open\" institution with only the justices' private conferences\ninaccessible to others.[247] In October 2010, the Court began the practice of\nposting on its website recordings and transcripts of oral arguments on the\nFriday after they occur.\n\n### Judicial interference in political\ndisputes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=39\n\"Edit section: Judicial interference in political disputes\")]\n\nSome Court decisions have been criticized for injecting the Court into the\npolitical arena, and deciding questions that are the purview of the other two\nbranches of government. The _[Bush v.
