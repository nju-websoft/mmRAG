It will serve as the home of the [Texas\nRangers](/wiki/Texas_Rangers_\\(baseball\\) \"Texas Rangers \\(baseball\\)\") of\n[Major League Baseball](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball \"Major League\nBaseball\").[8] [Globe Life and Accident Insurance\nCompany](/wiki/Globe_Life_and_Accident_Insurance_Company \"Globe Life and\nAccident Insurance Company\"), a subsidiary of [McKinney,\nTexas](/wiki/McKinney,_Texas \"McKinney, Texas\")-based [Torchmark\nCorporation](/wiki/Torchmark \"Torchmark\"), owns the naming rights for the\nfacility through 2048.[9] The new ballpark is going to be constructed across\nthe street just south of Globe Life Park.\n\nOn May 20, 2016, the Rangers announced that they would vacate [Globe Life Park\nin Arlington](/wiki/Globe_Life_Park_in_Arlington \"Globe Life Park in\nArlington\"). The new stadium will be constructed in a public/private\npartnership and have a [retractable roof](/wiki/Retractable_roof \"Retractable\nroof\").[10] The ballpark was approved on the following Election Day.[11] [HKS,\nInc.](/wiki/HKS,_Inc. \"HKS, Inc.\") was announced as the architect on January\n5, 2017.[3]\n\nThe Rangers cited weather as the reason attendances at Globe Life Park are\nlower than in other baseball stadiums in major metropolitan areas, since it is\nprone to high temperatures and rain delays. Therefore, the Rangers are\nproposing their new ballpark be constructed with a roof. Unlike its\npredecessors, the new stadium's center-field will face northeast, instead of\nsoutheast.[12]\n\nIn [2008](/wiki/2008_NFL_season \"2008 NFL season\"), the [NFL](/wiki/NFL\n\"NFL\")'s [Dallas Cowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\") managed to\nmove to a [retractable roof stadium](/wiki/AT%26T_Stadium \"AT&T Stadium\") due\nto the frequent hot weather in the\n[Metroplex](/wiki/Dallas%E2%80%93Fort_Worth_metroplex \"Dallas–Fort Worth\nmetroplex\"). The venue opened in time for the [2009](/wiki/2009_NFL_season\n\"2009 NFL season\") season. [13]\n\nThe preliminary 3D renderings[14] and artwork of the new stadium show the\ndesign to be very similar to the looks and layout of [Minute Maid\nPark](/wiki/Minute_Maid_Park \"Minute Maid Park\"), the [Houston\nAstros](/wiki/Houston_Astros \"Houston Astros\")' stadium. Final designs have\nnot been unveiled as of August 2017. A new shopping mall, as well as a Loews\nHotel, and a ballpark village are planned to go along with the new stadium.\nThe Rangers have also planned to make [Globe Life Park in\nArlington](/wiki/Globe_Life_Park_in_Arlington \"Globe Life Park in Arlington\")\npart of the Texas Live! complex. The plans to build the stadium have generated\na mixed reaction. The new stadium will mean a more comfortable environment to\nwatch baseball but will extend existing taxes used to pay for AT&T Stadium.\nAccording to _[The Dallas Morning News](/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News \"The\nDallas Morning News\")_ , \"The deal calls for the city to issue $500 million in\nbonds to help pay for the stadium. A half-cent of sales tax, 2 percent hotel\noccupancy tax and 5 percent car rental tax would pay off those bonds over an\nestimated 30 years. Voters also approved a ticket tax of up to 10 percent and\nparking tax of up to $3 at the new stadium. That money would be used for some\nof the Rangers' portion of the debt, which was criticized by the opposition\ncampaign.\"[15]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Globe_Life_Field&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of Major League Baseball stadiums](/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_stadiums \"List of Major League Baseball stadiums\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Globe_Life_Field&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** <https://www.mlb.com/rangers/ballpark/globe-life-field/information>\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Brumfield, Loyd (September 21, 2017).
