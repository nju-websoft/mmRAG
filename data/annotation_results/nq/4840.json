        "# National Football League Cheerleading\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**National Football League Cheerleading** , or simply **NFL Cheerleading** ,\nis a professional [cheerleading](/wiki/Cheerleading \"Cheerleading\")\norganization in the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"). 26\nof the 32 [NFL](/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\")\nteams include a cheerleading squad in their\n[franchise](/wiki/Professional_sports_league_organization \"Professional sports\nleague organization\"). Cheerleaders are a popular attraction that can give a\nteam more coverage/airtime, popular local support, and increased media image.\nIn 1954, the [Baltimore Colts](/wiki/Baltimore_Colts_\\(1947%E2%80%9350\\)\n\"Baltimore Colts \\(1947–50\\)\") became the first NFL team to have cheerleaders.\nThey were part of the [Baltimore Colts Marching\nBand](/wiki/Baltimore%27s_Marching_Ravens \"Baltimore's Marching Ravens\").\n\nMost NFL cheerleading squads are a [part-time](/wiki/Part-time_contract \"Part-\ntime contract\") job. Often, cheerleaders have completed or are attending a\n[university](/wiki/University \"University\"), and continue on to other careers\nafter cheering for one to four [seasons](/wiki/Season_\\(sports\\) \"Season\n\\(sports\\)\"). The members participate in practice, training camp, games,\nappearances, photo shoots, and charity events. Apart from their main duties of\ncheering during the football games, the cheerleaders have many other\nresponsibilities. Nearly every team member is available for appearances at\nschools, events, conferences, etc., for a set fee.\n\nAn anticipated annual event is the release of each squad's calendar, featuring\nmembers for each month in swimsuits, lingerie, or uniforms.\n\nAs well as being a mainstay of American football culture, the cheerleaders are\none of the biggest entertainment groups to regularly perform for the [United\nStates Armed Forces](/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces \"United States Armed\nForces\") overseas with performances and tours being enlisted by the\n[USO](/wiki/United_Service_Organizations \"United Service Organizations\").\nTeams send their [variety show](/wiki/Variety_show \"Variety show\"), an elite\ngroup of their best members, to perform combination shows of dance, music,\n[baton twirling](/wiki/Baton_twirling \"Baton twirling\"),\n[acrobatics](/wiki/Acrobatics \"Acrobatics\"), [gymnastics](/wiki/Gymnastics\n\"Gymnastics\"), and more. In February 2007, the [Buffalo\nBills](/wiki/Buffalo_Bills \"Buffalo Bills\") even sent a squad of eight along\nwith their choreographer into the war zone of Iraq. In 1996, the [San\nFrancisco 49ers Cheerleaders](/wiki/San_Francisco_Gold_Rush \"San Francisco\nGold Rush\") and their director helicoptered into the war inflicted country of\nBosnia with the USO and the U.S. Army. The U.S. troops in Korea have been\nentertained during the holiday season with the USO's Bob Hope Tour. Over the\nyears, the tour has featured NFL cheerleaders from the [Dallas\nCowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\") and the [San Francisco\n49ers](/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers \"San Francisco 49ers\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Cheerleader competitions\n  * 2 Teams\n    * 2.1 Teams without cheerleaders\n  * 3 Pro Bowl\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n## Cheerleader\ncompetitions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Football_League_Cheerleading&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Cheerleader competitions\")]\n\nThe first \"Battle of the NFL Cheerleaders\" was held in 1979 in Hollywood,\nFlorida. Two cheerleaders from each cheerleading team compete against other\nmini-teams in various athletic events. The events include kayaking, 100 yard\ndash, obstacle courses, and other events. The Minnesota Vikings Cheerleaders\ntook home the title in 1979. In 1980, it was held in Atlantic City, New Jersey\nand the Washington Redskinettes were the champions. The winners were Shiona\nBaum and Jeannie Fritz, and each received a car as the grand prize. The\ncompetition was resurrected in 2006 by the [NFL Network](/wiki/NFL_Network\n\"NFL Network\"), and was called _[NFL Cheerleader\nPlayoffs](/wiki/NFL_Cheerleader_Playoffs \"NFL Cheerleader Playoffs\")._ The\nplayoffs were taped between July 17 and July 21, 2006 at [Six Flags New\nEngland](/wiki/Six_Flags_New_England \"Six Flags New England\") in Agawam,\nMassachusetts. Two-person teams of cheerleaders from 25 of the NFL's 32 teams\nparticipated in a four-event series of competitions. The first two events\ntested the cheerleaders' athletic abilities in events like the 100-yard dash,\nkayaking, tandem cycling, and the obstacle course. The third event was a\ntrivia challenge called \"Know Your NFL.\" The final competition was a one-\nminute dance routine, similar to what they normally perform on NFL sidelines.\nThe San Diego Chargers team (Casie and Shantel) defeated the Atlanta Falcons\nand St. Louis Rams squads to win the overall championship. The 3 teams\nfinished in a three-way tie, with 210 points. The Chargers were declared the\nwinners based on winning the dance competition.\n\n##\nTeams[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Football_League_Cheerleading&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section:

\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Packers collegiate squad in 2009\n\nAs of 2016, six teams do not have cheerleading squads: [Buffalo\nBills](/wiki/Buffalo_Bills \"Buffalo Bills\"), [Chicago\nBears](/wiki/Chicago_Bears \"Chicago Bears\"), [Cleveland\nBrowns](/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland Browns\"), [Green Bay\nPackers](/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers \"Green Bay Packers\"), [New York\nGiants](/wiki/New_York_Giants \"New York Giants\"), and the [Pittsburgh\nSteelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\"). The Packers do,\nhowever, use a collegiate squad to cheer at home games.[19] [Super Bowl\nXLV](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLV \"Super Bowl XLV\") between the Steelers and the\nPackers in February 2011 was the first time a Super Bowl featured no\ncheerleaders. The Browns and the Giants are the only NFL teams that have never\nhad cheerleaders, while the other aforementioned teams have had cheer squads\nin the past.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills endorsed the officially independent [Buffalo\nJills](/wiki/Buffalo_Jills \"Buffalo Jills\") from 1966 to 2013; when several\ncheerleaders sued both the Jills and the Bills organizations, the Jills\nsuspended operations.[20]\n\nTeams of \"unofficial\" cheerleaders began emerging in 2010 for NFL teams that\ndon't have their own dance squad. These unofficial cheerleaders aren't\nsanctioned by the NFL or any franchise in the NFL and therefore are not\nallowed to perform at games, represent the football team at any outside\nfunctions, or use any of the team's branding or trademarked colors on their\nuniforms. The teams are sponsored by local businesses, and the cheerleaders\nperform prior to the game, at tailgate parties, and other local events. Some\nalso attend the local NFL games in uniform, and sit together in their block of\nseason ticket seats. Their audition process, costuming, and choreography are\nvery similar to official NFL cheer teams. Some also produce an annual swimsuit\ncalendar, just like the legitimate cheerleaders. All of the independent teams\nhope at some point to be embraced by the NFL as \"official\" cheerleaders of\ntheir local teams.\n\n  * The Detroit Pride Cheerleaders were the first independent professional team, put together in August 2010 to support the Lions.[21] However, as the squad was not officially recognized by the Lions, it could not use the Lions' logos nor colors.[22] In 2016, the Lions started an official cheerleading squad.\n  * The Gotham City Cheerleaders were organized in August 2011 to support all New York sports, but are most closely associated with the Giants. The team has also been known as the New York Unofficials, the Unofficial Dancers of the New York Giants, and the Gotham’s Team Blue Army Dancers.[23]\n  * The Cleveland Spirit Cheerleaders were created in September 2012 to support the Browns as a test team to attract fan interest.[22] This cheer team was created by the same people responsible for the Detroit Pride.[24]\n\n## Pro\nBowl[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Football_League_Cheerleading&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Pro Bowl\")]\n\nA top honor for an NFL Cheerleader is to be selected as a [Pro\nBowl](/wiki/Pro_Bowl \"Pro Bowl\") Cheerleader. The group is composed of an all-\nstar cheerleader (one from each NFL cheer team) that represents her NFL team\nat the Pro Bowl in Hawaii. The Pro Bowl Cheerleaders were founded in 1992 and\ndirected by [Jay Howarth](/w/index.php?title=Jay_Howarth&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Jay Howarth \\(page does not exist\\)\") and [Angela King-\nTwitero](/wiki/Angela_King-Twitero \"Angela King-Twitero\").
