        "# Legal status of tattooing in the United States\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nIn the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"), there is no\nfederal law regulating the practice of [tattooing](/wiki/Tattooing\n\"Tattooing\"). However, all 50 states and the [District of\nColumbia](/wiki/District_of_Columbia \"District of Columbia\") have statutory\nlaws requiring a person receiving a tattoo be **18 years or older**. This is\npartially based on the legal principle that a minor cannot enter into a legal\ncontract or otherwise render [informed consent](/wiki/Informed_consent\n\"Informed consent\") for a procedure. Most states permit a person under the age\nof 18 to receive a tattoo with permission of a parent or guardian, but some\nstates outright prohibit tattooing under a certain age regardless of\npermission, with the exception of medical necessity (such as markings placed\nfor [radiation therapy](/wiki/Radiation_therapy \"Radiation therapy\")).\n\nIn all jurisdictions, individual tattooists may also choose to place\nadditional restrictions based on their own moral feelings, such as refusing\n_any_ clients under a specific age even with parental consent despite it being\nlegal, or limiting the type and/or location of where they are willing to\ntattoo (such as refusing any work around intimate parts of the body). They may\nadditionally refuse to perform specific artwork, including if they merely find\nit inappropriate or offensive, or refuse to work on a client that they suspect\nmay be intoxicated. Artists sometimes claim their personal business\nrestrictions are a matter of law even when it is not true, so as to avoid\narguments with clients.\n\nLegal Restrictions on Tattooing & Body Modification by State State | Minimum Age (with parent/guardian consent) | Form of Parent/Guardian Consent | Notes & Exceptions | Intoxicated/Impaired Individuals | Area of Law/Type of Penalty | Licensing & Regulation | Relevant Statute(s) and Rules  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nAlabama | none specified[1] | informed written consent, signed in presence of the artist/service provider or their agent[1][2] | Ear piercing exempt from Alabama body art laws & rules.[2][3] | cannot be tattooed, branded, or pierced[1][2] | Violations of Alabama Tattoo & Body Piercing laws are a class c misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $100 and/or up to 90 days imprisonment for each violation.[4] | Alabama's Department of Public Health licenses Tattoo, body piercing, & body art facilities, and sets standards for their operation.[5] Individual tattoo artists, piercers, etc. require a permit.[2] | Ala.
