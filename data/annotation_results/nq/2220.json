Usually the box-spring\nis placed on top of a wooden or metal [bedframe](/wiki/Bedframe \"Bedframe\")\nthat sits on the floor and acts as a brace, except in the UK where the divan\nis more often fitted with small [casters](/wiki/Caster \"Caster\"). The box-\nspring is usually the same size as the much softer [mattress](/wiki/Mattress\n\"Mattress\") that is placed on it. Working together, the box-spring and\nmattress (with optional bed frame) make up a bed. It is common to find a box-\nspring and mattress being used together without the support of a frame\nunderneath, the box spring being mounted directly on casters standing on the\nfloor.\n\nThe purpose of the box-spring is threefold:\n\n  * to raise the mattress's height, making it easier to get in and out of [bed](/wiki/Bed \"Bed\");\n  * to absorb shock and reduce wear to the mattress; and\n  * to create a flat and firm structure for the mattress to lie upon.\n\nThe first rectangular spring-cushioned wire frames to support mattresses did\nnot have wood rims or cloth covers. These were called **bedsprings**. More and\nmore box-springs are being made out of wood, then covered in fabrics. Wood\nmakes a better support system for the newer memory foam and latex mattresses.\nThe newest design in box-springs is the folding box spring made of wood or\nmetal, then covered in fabric which can fold in half and can be sent by\nshipping and courier companies.[1]\n\nWith the increasing height of mattresses, manufacturers now make box springs\nin different heights so that the mattress and box spring pair maintain a\nstandard height. Standard \"high profile\" box springs are 9 inches (23 cm) in\nheight, whereas \"low profile\" box springs are between 5 and 5.5 inches (13 and\n14 cm). Changing the thickness of the box spring and mattress require\nrevisions to the mattress and box spring coil stiffness. This is often why box\nspring and mattress are matched and sold in pairs.\n\n## Alternatives[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Box-spring&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Alternatives\")]\n\nBox-spring beds are especially popular in North America and Western Europe.\n\nAlternatively, in Japan, [futon](/wiki/Futon \"Futon\") mattresses are usually\neither placed on a bedframe or on the floor, without the use of springs.\n\nIn Europe, wooden frames with a middle section consisting of springs held in\nplace by wire (to be put into the wooden bedframe as a unit) used to be the\nstandard for most of the 20th century.  \nThe springs have mostly been replaced by pre-bent wooden slats (usually\n[glulam](/wiki/Glulam \"Glulam\") made from [beech](/wiki/Beech \"Beech\") or\n[birch](/wiki/Birch \"Birch\")) which are joined to the outer wooden frame by\nsome form of flexible rubber [bolt](/wiki/Bolt_\\(fastener\\) \"Bolt\n\\(fastener\\)\"), shoe or socket. This lath floor provides suspension, allows\nthe mattress to ventilate, and can be designed to be vertically adjustable in\norder to elevate the legs and / or the [torso](/wiki/Torso \"Torso\").  \nA more simple approach is to join straight [laths](/wiki/Lath \"Lath\") with a\ntextile strap so that they can be rolled up for transport and placed right\ninto the bedframe.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | Wikimedia Commons has media related to _**[Box-spring](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Box-spring \"commons:Category:Box-spring\")**_.  \n---|---  \n  \n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Box-spring&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Invention Machine and the Case of the Boxed-Up Box Spring\"](http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2008/03/05/invention-machine-and-the-case-of-the-boxed-up-box-spring/). _Xconomy_.
