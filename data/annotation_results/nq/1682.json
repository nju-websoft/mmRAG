The state's\narmed forces were reorganised—the war marked the founding of the [Royal Air\nForce](/wiki/Royal_Air_Force \"Royal Air Force\"), for example—and increased in\nsize because of the introduction, in January 1916, of\n[conscription](/wiki/Conscription \"Conscription\") for the first time in the\ncountry's history as well as the raising of what was, at the time, the largest\nall-volunteer army in history, known as [Kitchener's\nArmy](/wiki/Kitchener%27s_Army \"Kitchener's Army\"), of more than 2,000,000\nmen.[5]:504 The outbreak of war has generally been regarded as a socially\nunifying event,[6] although this view has been challenged by more recent\nscholarship. In any case, responses in Great Britain in 1914 were similar to\nthose amongst populations across Europe.[7]\n\nOn the eve of war, there was serious domestic unrest in the UK (amongst the\nlabour and suffrage movements and especially in Ireland) but much of the\npopulation rapidly rallied behind the government. Significant sacrifices were\nmade in the name of defeating the Empire's enemies and many of those who could\nnot fight contributed to philanthropic and humanitarian causes. Fearing food\nshortages and labour shortfalls, the government passed legislation such as the\n[Defence of the Realm Act 1914](/wiki/Defence_of_the_Realm_Act_1914 \"Defence\nof the Realm Act 1914\"), to give it new powers. The war saw a move away from\nthe idea of \"[business as usual](/wiki/Business_as_usual_\\(policy\\) \"Business\nas usual \\(policy\\)\")\" under [Prime\nMinister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Prime Minister of the\nUnited Kingdom\") [H. H. Asquith](/wiki/H._H._Asquith \"H. H. Asquith\"),[8] and\ntowards a state of [total war](/wiki/Total_war \"Total war\") (complete state\nintervention in public affairs) under the premiership of [David Lloyd\nGeorge](/wiki/David_Lloyd_George \"David Lloyd George\");[9] the first time this\nhad been seen in Britain. The war also witnessed the first [aerial\nbombardments of cities in\nBritain](/wiki/German_strategic_bombing_during_World_War_I \"German strategic\nbombing during World War I\").\n\nNewspapers played an important role in maintaining popular support for the\nwar.[10] Large quantities of propaganda were produced by the government under\nthe guidance of such journalists as [Charles\nMasterman](/wiki/Charles_Masterman \"Charles Masterman\") and newspaper owners\nsuch as [Lord Beaverbrook](/wiki/Max_Aitken,_1st_Baron_Beaverbrook \"Max\nAitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook\"). By adapting to the changing demographics of\nthe workforce (or the \"dilution of labour\", as it was termed), war-related\nindustries grew rapidly, and production increased, as concessions were quickly\nmade to [trade unions](/wiki/Trade_union \"Trade union\").[11] In that regard,\nthe war is also credited by some with drawing women into mainstream employment\nfor the first time.[12] Debates continue about the impact the war had on\nwomen's emancipation, given that a large number of women were granted the vote\nfor the first time in [1918](/wiki/1918_UK_general_election \"1918 UK general\nelection\"). The experience of individual women during the war varied; much\ndepended on locality, age, marital status and occupation.[13][14]\n\nThe civilian death rate rose due to food shortages and [Spanish\nFlu](/wiki/Spanish_Flu \"Spanish Flu\"), which hit the country in 1918.[15]\nMilitary deaths are estimated to have exceeded 850,000.[16] The Empire reached\nits zenith at the conclusion of peace negotiations.[17] However, the war\nheightened not only imperial loyalties but also individual national identities\nin the Dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South\nAfrica) and India. [Irish nationalists](/wiki/Irish_nationalists \"Irish\nnationalists\") after 1916 moved from collaboration with London to demands for\nimmediate independence (see [Easter Rising](/wiki/Easter_Rising \"Easter\nRising\")), a move given great impetus by the [Conscription Crisis of\n1918](/wiki/Conscription_Crisis_of_1918 \"Conscription Crisis of 1918\").[18]\n\nMilitary historians continue to debate matters of tactics and strategy.\nHowever, in terms of memory of the war, historian Adrian Gregory argues that:\n\n    \"The verdict of popular culture is more or less unanimous. The First World War was stupid, tragic and futile. The stupidity of the war has been a theme of growing strength since the 1920s.

Asquith of the [Liberal Party](/wiki/Liberal_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Liberal Party\n\\(UK\\)\") as Prime Minister. Britain's reasons for declaring war were complex.\n\nThe ostensible reason given was that Britain was required to safeguard\nBelgium's neutrality under the 1839 [Treaty of\nLondon](/wiki/Treaty_of_London_\\(1839\\) \"Treaty of London \\(1839\\)\"). The\nGerman invasion of Belgium was, therefore, the _[casus\nbelli](/wiki/Casus_belli \"Casus belli\")_ and, importantly, legitimized and\ngalvanized popular support for the war.\n\nThe strategic risk posed by German control of the Belgian and ultimately\nFrench coast was considered unacceptable. German guarantees of post-war\nbehaviour were cast into doubt by her blasé treatment of Belgian neutrality.\nHowever, the Treaty of London had not committed Britain on her own to\nsafeguard Belgium's neutrality. Moreover, naval war planning demonstrated that\nBritain herself would have violated Belgian neutrality by blockading her ports\n(to prevent imported goods passing to Germany) in the event of war with\nGermany.\n\nBritain's relationship with her Entente partners, both France and Russia, were\nequally significant factors. The Foreign Secretary [Edward\nGrey](/wiki/Edward_Grey,_1st_Viscount_Grey_of_Fallodon \"Edward Grey, 1st\nViscount Grey of Fallodon\") argued that the secret naval agreements with\nFrance (although they had not been approved by the Cabinet) created a moral\nobligation _vis a vis_ Britain and France. What is more, in the event that\nBritain abandoned its Entente friends, it was feared that if Germany won the\nwar, or the Entente won without British support, then, either way, Britain\nwould be left without any friends. This would have left both Britain and her\nEmpire vulnerable to attack.\n\nBritish Foreign office mandarin [Eyre Crowe](/wiki/Eyre_Crowe \"Eyre Crowe\")\nsaid:\n\n> \"Should the war come, and England stand aside, one of two things must\n> happen. (a) Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate\n> Russia. What will be the position of a friendless England? (b) Or France and\n> Russia win. What would be their attitude towards England? What about India\n> and the Mediterranean?\"[20]:544\n\nThe Liberal Party might have survived a short war, but the totality of the\nGreat War called for strong measures that the Party had long rejected. The\nresult was the permanent destruction of the ability of the Liberal Party to\nlead a government. Historian [Robert Blake](/wiki/Robert_Blake,_Baron_Blake\n\"Robert Blake, Baron Blake\") explains the dilemma:\n\n    the Liberals were traditionally the party of freedom of speech, conscience and trade. They were against jingoism, heavy armaments and compulsion....Liberals were neither wholehearted nor unanimous about conscription, censorship, the [Defence of the Realm Act](/wiki/Defence_of_the_Realm_Act \"Defence of the Realm Act\"), severity toward aliens and pacifists, direction of labour and industry. The Conservatives... had no such misgivings.[21]\n\nBlake further notes that it was the Liberals, not the Conservatives who needed\nthe moral outrage of Belgium to justify going to war, while the Conservatives\ncalled for intervention from the start of the crisis on the grounds of\n_[realpolitik](/wiki/Realpolitik \"Realpolitik\")_ and the balance of power.[22]\n\nAsquith's Liberal government was brought down in May 1915, due in particular\nto a [crisis in inadequate artillery shell\nproduction](/wiki/Shell_Crisis_of_1915 \"Shell Crisis of 1915\") and the protest\nresignation of [Jackie Fisher](/wiki/John_Fisher,_1st_Baron_Fisher \"John\nFisher, 1st Baron Fisher\") over the [Gallipoli\nCampaign](/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign \"Gallipoli Campaign\") against Turkey.\nReluctant to face doom in an election, Asquith formed a new coalition\ngovernment on 25 May, with the majority of the new cabinet coming from his own\nLiberal party and the [Unionist (Conservative)\nparty](/wiki/Conservative_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Conservative Party \\(UK\\)\"), along\nwith a token Labour representation. The new government lasted a year and a\nhalf, and was the last time Liberals controlled the government.[23]\n\n### Lloyd George as Prime\nMinister[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Lloyd George as Prime Minister\")]\n\nMain article: [Lloyd George ministry](/wiki/Lloyd_George_ministry \"Lloyd\nGeorge ministry\")\n\nThis coalition government lasted until 1916, when the Unionists became\ndissatisfied with Asquith and the Liberals' conduct of affairs, particularly\nover the [Battle of the Somme](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme \"Battle of the\nSomme\").[24] Asquith's opponents now took control, led by [Bonar\nLaw](/wiki/Bonar_Law \"Bonar Law\") (leader of the Conservatives), [Sir Edward\nCarson](/wiki/Sir_Edward_Carson \"Sir Edward Carson\") (leader of the [Ulster\nUnionists](/wiki/Ulster_Unionists \"Ulster Unionists\")), and [David Lloyd\nGeorge](/wiki/David_Lloyd_George \"David Lloyd George\") (then a minister in the\ncabinet). Law, who had few allies outside his own party, lacked sufficient\nsupport to form a new coalition; the Liberal Lloyd George, on the other hand,\nenjoyed much wider support and duly formed a majority-Conservative [coalition\ngovernment](/wiki/Coalition_Government_1916%E2%80%931922 \"Coalition Government\n1916–1922\") with Lloyd George Liberals and Labour. Asquith was still the party\nhead but he and his followers moved to the opposition benches in\nParliament.[25]\n\nLloyd George immediately set about transforming the British war effort, taking\nfirm control of both military and domestic policy.[26][27] In the first 235\ndays of its existence, the War Cabinet met 200 times.[9] Its creation marked\nthe transition to a state of [total war](/wiki/Total_war \"Total war\")—the idea\nthat every man, woman and child should play his or her part in the war effort.\nMoreover, it was decided that members of the government should be the men who\ncontrolled the war effort, primarily utilising the power they had been given\nunder the [Defence of the Realm Act](/wiki/Defence_of_the_Realm_Act \"Defence\nof the Realm Act\").[9] For the first time, the government could react quickly,\nwithout endless bureaucracy to tie it down, and with up-to-date statistics on\nsuch matters as the state of the [merchant navy](/wiki/Merchant_navy \"Merchant\nnavy\") and farm production.[9] The policy marked a distinct shift away from\nAsquith's initial policy of [laissez-faire](/wiki/Laissez-faire \"Laissez-\nfaire\"),[8] which had been characterised by [Winston\nChurchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill \"Winston Churchill\")'s declaration of\n\"[business as usual](/wiki/Business_as_usual_\\(policy\\) \"Business as usual\n\\(policy\\)\")\" in November 1914.[28] The success of Lloyd George's government\ncan also be attributed to a general lack of desire for an election, and the\npractical absence of dissent that this brought about.[29]\n\n[![Head and shoulders of a middle-aged gentleman with a bushy\nmoustache](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/LloydGeorge.jpg/220px-\nLloydGeorge.jpg)](/wiki/File:LloydGeorge.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:LloydGeorge.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDavid Lloyd George (c. 1920), prime minister at the end of the war\n\nIn rapid succession in spring 1918 came a series of military and political\ncrises.[30] The Germans, having moved troops from the Eastern front and\nretrained them in new tactics, now had more soldiers on the Western Front than\nthe Allies. On 21 March 1918 Germany launched a full scale [Spring\nOffensive](/wiki/Spring_Offensive \"Spring Offensive\") against the British and\nFrench lines, hoping for victory on the battlefield before United States\ntroops arrived in large numbers. The Allied armies fell back 40 miles in\nconfusion, and facing defeat London realized it needed more troops to fight a\nmobile war. Lloyd George found half a million soldiers and rushed them to\nFrance, asked American President [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson\n\"Woodrow Wilson\") for immediate help, and agreed to the appointment of the\nFrench Marshal Foch as commander in chief on the Western Front, so that Allied\nforces could be coordinated to handle the German offensive.[31]\n\nDespite strong warnings that it was a bad idea, the War Cabinet [decided to\nimpose conscription on Ireland](/wiki/Conscription_Crisis_of_1918\n\"Conscription Crisis of 1918\") in 1918. The main reason was that labour in\nBritain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain\nworkers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but\nit did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The\nproposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the\nfirst time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory\nmilitary service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting\nthe intransigent [Sinn Féin](/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in \"Sinn Féin\") movement (away\nfrom the constitutional [Irish National Party](/wiki/Irish_National_Party\n\"Irish National Party\")). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of\nIrish willingness to stay inside the Union.[32][33]\n\nOn 7 May 1918, a senior army officer on active duty, Major-General [Sir\nFrederick Maurice](/wiki/Frederick_Barton_Maurice \"Frederick Barton Maurice\"),\nprompted [a second crisis](/wiki/Maurice_Debate \"Maurice Debate\") when he went\npublic with allegations that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military\nmatters. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and\nattacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal). While Asquith's presentation was poor,\nLloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote\nof confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's\nallegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith,\nend public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of\nthe military.[34][35] Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled and was\nultimately reversed. Victory came on 11 November 1918.[36]\n\nHistorian George H. Cassar has evaluated Lloyd George's legacy as a war\nleader:\n\n    After all that has been said and done, what are we to make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he achieved varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure.

The war was financed by borrowing large sums at\nhome and abroad, by new taxes, and by inflation. It was implicitly financed by\npostponing maintenance and repair, and cancelling unneeded projects.[40] The\ngovernment avoided indirect taxes because they raised the cost of living, and\ncaused discontent among the working class. In 1913-14, indirect taxes on\ntobacco and alcohol yielded £75 million, while direct taxes yielded £88\nmillion, including an income tax of £44 million and estate duties of £22\nmillion. That is, 54 percent of revenue came from direct taxes; by 1918,\ndirect taxes were 80 percent of revenue.[41] There was a strong emphasis on\nbeing \"fair\" and being \"scientific.\" The public generally supported the heavy\nnew taxes, with minimal complaints. The Treasury rejected proposals for a\nstiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the\ncapitalists. Instead, there was an excess profits tax, of 50 percent of\nprofits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in\n1917.[42][43] Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles,\nclocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax. The main\nincrease in revenue came from income tax, which in 1915 went up to 3s. 6d in\nthe pound (17.5%), and individual exemptions were lowered. The income tax rate\ngrew to 5s in the pound (25%) in 1916, and 6s (30%) in 1918. Altogether, taxes\nprovided at most 30 percent of national expenditure, with the rest from\nborrowing. The national debt soared from £625 million to £7,800 million.\nGovernment bonds typically paid five percent. Inflation escalated so that the\npound in 1919 purchased only a third of the basket it had purchased it 1914.\nWages were laggard, and the poor and retired were especially hard hit.[44][45]\n\n##\nMonarchy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Monarchy\")]\n\n[![A man, wearing a crown and holding a broom, sweeps away a collection of\nother\ncrowns](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/A_Good_Riddance_-\n_George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_cartoon_in_Punch%2C_1917.png/220px-\nA_Good_Riddance_-\n_George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_cartoon_in_Punch%2C_1917.png)](/wiki/File:A_Good_Riddance_-\n_George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_cartoon_in_Punch,_1917.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:A_Good_Riddance_-\n_George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_cartoon_in_Punch,_1917.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"A good riddance\"  \nA 1917 _[Punch](/wiki/Punch_\\(magazine\\) \"Punch \\(magazine\\)\")_ cartoon\ndepicts King George sweeping away his German titles.\n\nFurther information: [George V § First World\nWar](/wiki/George_V#First_World_War \"George V\")\n\nThe British Royal Family faced a serious problem during the First World War\nbecause of its blood ties to the ruling family of Germany, Britain's prime\nadversary in the war. Before the war, the British royal family had been known\nas the [House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha](/wiki/House_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha\n\"House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\"). In 1910, [George V](/wiki/George_V \"George\nV\") became King on the death of his father, [King Edward VII](/wiki/Edward_VII\n\"Edward VII\"), and remained king throughout the war. He was the [first\ncousin](/wiki/Cousin_chart \"Cousin chart\") of the German Kaiser [Wilhelm\nII](/wiki/William_II,_German_Emperor \"William II, German Emperor\"), who came\nto symbolise all the horrors of the war. [Queen Mary](/wiki/Mary_of_Teck \"Mary\nof Teck\"), although British like her mother, was the daughter of the [Duke of\nTeck](/wiki/Duke_of_Teck \"Duke of Teck\"), a descendant of the German [Royal\nHouse of Württemberg](/wiki/Rulers_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg \"Rulers of\nWürttemberg\"). During the war [H. G. Wells](/wiki/H._G._Wells \"H. G.

He specifically adopted Windsor as the surname for all descendants\nof [Queen Victoria](/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Victoria of the\nUnited Kingdom\") then living in Britain, excluding women who married into\nother families and their descendants.[47] He and his relatives who were\nBritish subjects relinquished the use of all German titles and styles, and\nadopted English surnames. George compensated several of his male relatives by\ncreating them British peers. Thus, his cousin, [Prince Louis of\nBattenberg](/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Marquess_of_Milford_Haven \"Louis\nMountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven\"), became the Marquess of Milford\nHaven, while his brother-in-law, the [Duke of\nTeck](/wiki/Adolphus_Cambridge,_1st_Marquess_of_Cambridge \"Adolphus Cambridge,\n1st Marquess of Cambridge\"), became the Marquess of Cambridge.

The system for titling members of the royal family\nwas also simplified.[48] Relatives of the British royal family who fought on\nthe German side were simply cut off; their British peerages were suspended by\na 1919 Order in Council under the provisions of the [Titles Deprivation Act\n1917](/wiki/Titles_Deprivation_Act_1917 \"Titles Deprivation Act 1917\").[49]\n\n[![Two look-alike men.

The cabinet agreed but the king was worried that public opinion\nwas hostile and said no. It is likely the tsar would have refused to leave\nRussia in any case.

The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in\n1918 (compared to 50% in 1943).[116][117] The war forced Britain to use up its\nfinancial reserves and borrow large sums from private and government creditors\nin the United States.[118] Shipments of American raw materials and food\nallowed Britain to feed itself and its army while maintaining his\nproductivity.

In 1916, it became\nillegal to consume more than two courses whilst lunching in a public eating\nplace or more than three for dinner; fines were introduced for members of the\npublic found feeding the [pigeons](/wiki/Pigeon \"Pigeon\") or stray\nanimals.[63]\n\nIn January 1917, Germany started using [U-boats](/wiki/U-boats \"U-boats\")\n(submarines) in order to sink Allied and later neutral ships bringing food to\nthe country in an attempt to starve Britain into surrender under their\n[unrestricted submarine warfare](/wiki/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare\n\"Unrestricted submarine warfare\") programme. One response to this threat was\nto introduce voluntary [rationing](/wiki/Rationing \"Rationing\") in February\n1917,[63] a scheme said to have been endorsed by the King and Queen\nthemselves.[126] Bread was subsidised from September that year; prompted by\n[local authorities](/wiki/Local_government \"Local government\") taking matters\ninto their own hands, compulsory rationing was introduced in stages between\nDecember 1917 and February 1918,[63] as Britain's supply of wheat stores\ndecreased to just six weeks worth.[127] It is said to have in the most part\nbenefited the health of the country,[63] through the 'levelling of consumption\nof essential foodstuffs'.[128] To assist with rationing, [ration\nbooks](/wiki/Rationing \"Rationing\") were introduced on 15 July 1918 for\nbutter, margarine, lard, meat, and sugar.[129] During the war, average\ncalorific intake decreased only three percent, but protein intake six\npercent.[63]\n\n###\nIndustry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Industry\")]\n\n[![Workers stand around a large forge, where a shell burns red-\nhot.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/WWIworkersElisabethville.jpg/220px-\nWWIworkersElisabethville.jpg)](/wiki/File:WWIworkersElisabethville.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:WWIworkersElisabethville.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nForging steel shell cases\n\nTotal British production fell by ten percent over the course of the war; there\nwere, however, increases in certain industries such as steel.[11] Although\nBritain faced a highly contentious [Shell Crisis of\n1915](/wiki/Shell_Crisis_of_1915 \"Shell Crisis of 1915\") With severe shortages\nof artillery shells reported from the Western Front. In 1915, a powerful new\n[Ministry of Munitions](/wiki/Ministry_of_Munitions \"Ministry of Munitions\")\nunder [David Lloyd George](/wiki/David_Lloyd_George \"David Lloyd George\") was\nformed to control munitions production.[130][131]\n\nThe Government's policy, according to historian and Conservative politician\n[J. A. R. Marriott](/wiki/J._A._R._Marriott \"J. A. R. Marriott\"), was that:\n\n    no private interest was to be permitted to obstruct the service, or imperil the safety, of the State. Trade Union regulations must be suspended; employers' profits must be limited, skilled men must fight, if not in the trenches, in the factories; man-power must be economize by the dilution of labour and the employment of women; Private factories must pass under the control of the State, and new national factories be set up. Results justified the new policy: the output was prodigious; the goods were at last delivered.[132]\n\nBy April 1915, just two million rounds of shells had been sent to France; by\nthe end of the war the figure had reached 187 million,[133] and a year's worth\nof pre-war production of light munitions could be completed in just four days\nby 1918. Aircraft production in 1914 provided employment for 60,000 men and\nwomen; by 1918 British firms employed over 347,000.[11]\n\n###\nLabour[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Labour\")]\n\nIndustrial production of munitions was a central feature of the war, and with\na third of the men in the labour force moved into the military, demand was\nvery high for industrial labour. Large numbers of women were employed\ntemporarily.[134] Most trade unions gave strong support to the war effort,\ncutting back on strikes and restrictive practices. However the coal miners and\nengineers were less enthusiastic.[135] Trade unions were encouraged as\nmembership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918, peaking at\n8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.[136] Membership\nsoared from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918, peaking at 8.3 million\nin 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.[136] In 1914, 65% of union\nmembers had been associated with the [Trades Union\nCongress](/wiki/Trades_Union_Congress \"Trades Union Congress\") (TUC) rising to\n77% in 1920. Women were grudgingly admitted to the trade unions. Looking at a\nunion of unskilled workers, Cathy Hunt concludes its regard for women workers,\n\"was at best inconsistent and at worst aimed almost entirely at improving and\nprotecting working conditions for its male members.\"[137] Labour's prestige\nhad never been higher, and it systematically placed its leaders into\nParliament.[138]\n\nThe [Munitions of War Act 1915](/wiki/Munitions_of_War_Act_1915 \"Munitions of\nWar Act 1915\") followed the [Shell Crisis of 1915](/wiki/Shell_Crisis_of_1915\n\"Shell Crisis of 1915\") when supplies of material to the front became a\npolitical issue. The Act forbade strikes and lockouts and replaced them with\ncompulsory arbitration. It set up a system of controlling war industries, and\nestablished munitions tribunals that were special courts to enforce good\nworking practices. It suspended, for the duration, restrictive practices by\ntrade unions. It tried to control labour mobility between jobs. The courts\nruled the definition of munitions was broad enough to include textile workers\nand dock workers. The 1915 act was repealed in 1919, but similar legislation\ntook effect during the Second World War.[139][140][141]\n\nIt was only as late as December 1917 that a War Cabinet Committee on Manpower\nwas established, and the British government refrained from introducing\ncompulsory labour direction (though 388 men were moved as part of the\nvoluntary National Service Scheme). Belgian refugees became workers, though\nthey were often seen as \"job stealers\". Likewise, the use of Irish workers,\nbecause they were exempt from conscription, was another source of\nresentment.[142] Worried about the impact of the dilution of labour caused by\nbringing external groups into the main labour pool, workers in some areas\nturned to [strike action](/wiki/Strike_action \"Strike action\"). The efficiency\nof major industries improved markedly during the war. For example, the Singer\nClydebank sewing machine factory received over 5000 government contracts, and\nmade 303 million artillery shells, shell components, fuzes, and airplane\nparts, as well as grenades, rifle parts, and 361,000 horseshoes. Its labour\nforce of 14,000 was about 70 percent female at war's end.[143]\n\n###\nEnergy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Energy\")]\n\nEnergy was a critical factor for the British war effort. Most of the energy\nsupplies came from coal mines in Britain, where the issue was labour supply.\nCritical however was the flow of oil for ships, lorries and industrial use.\nThere were no oil wells in Britain so everything was imported. The U.S. pumped\ntwo-thirds of the world's oil. In 1917, total British consumption was 827\nmillion barrels, of which 85 percent was supplied by the United States, and 6\npercent by Mexico.[144] The great issue in 1917 was how many tankers would\nsurvive the German u-boats. Convoys and the construction of new tankers solved\nthe German threat, while tight government controls guaranteed that all\nessential needs were covered. An Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference allocated\nAmerican supplies to Britain, France and Italy.[145]\n\nFuel oil for the Royal Navy was the highest priority. In 1917, the Royal Navy\nconsumed 12,500 tons a month, but had a supply of 30,000 tons a month from the\n[Anglo-Persian Oil Company](/wiki/Anglo-Persian_Oil_Company \"Anglo-Persian Oil\nCompany\"), using their oil wells in Persia.[146]\n\n## Social\nchange[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Social change\")]\n\nMain article: [Women's roles in the World Wars § World War\nI](/wiki/Women%27s_roles_in_the_World_Wars#World_War_I \"Women's roles in the\nWorld Wars\")\n\nVariously throughout the war, serious shortage of [able-bodied](/wiki/Able-\nbodied \"Able-bodied\") men (\"manpower\") occurred in the country, and women were\nrequired to take on many of the traditional male roles, particularly in the\narea of arms manufacture; though this was only significant in the later years\nof the war, since unemployed men were often prioritised by employers.[12]\nWomen both found work in the [munitions](/wiki/Munitions \"Munitions\")\nfactories (as \"munitionettes\") despite initial [trade union](/wiki/Trade_union\n\"Trade union\") opposition, which directly helped the war effort, but also in\nthe [Civil Service](/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Civil_Service \"Her Majesty's Civil\nService\"), where they took men's jobs, releasing them for the front. The\nnumber of women employed by the service increased from 33,000 in 1911 to over\n102,000 by 1921.[147] The overall increase in female employment is estimated\nat 1.4 million, from 5.9 to 7.3 million,[12] and female trade union membership\nincreased from 357,000 in 1914 to over a million by 1918—an increase of 160\npercent.[147] Beckett suggests that most of these were [working\nclass](/wiki/Working_class \"Working class\") women going into work at a younger\nage than they would otherwise have done, or married women returning to\nwork.[12] This taken together with the fact that only 23 percent of women in\nthe munitions industry were actually doing men's jobs, would limit\nsubstantially the overall impact of the war on the long-term prospects of the\nworking woman.[12]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Women%27s-Land-\nArmy-1917.jpg/220px-Women%27s-Land-Army-1917.jpg)](/wiki/File:Women%27s-Land-\nArmy-1917.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Women%27s-Land-Army-1917.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFirst World War poster\n\nWhen the government targeted women early in the war focussed on extending\ntheir existing roles – helping with Belgian refugees, for example—but also on\nimproving recruitment rates amongst men. They did this both through the so-\ncalled \"Order of the White Feather\" and through the promise of home comforts\nfor the men while they were at the front. In February 1916, groups were set up\nand a campaign started to get women to help in agriculture and in March 1917,\nthe [Women's Land Army](/wiki/Women%27s_Land_Army \"Women's Land Army\") was set\nup. One goal was to attract middle-class women who would act as models for\npatriotic engagement in nontraditional duties. However the uniform of the\nWomen's Land Army included male overalls and trousers, which sparked debate on\nthe propriety of such cross-dressing. The government responded with rhetoric\nthat explicitly feminized the new roles.[148] In 1918, the [Board of\nTrade](/wiki/Board_of_Trade \"Board of Trade\") estimated that there were\n148,000 women in agricultural employment, though a figure of nearly 260,000\nhas also been suggested.[12]\n\nThe war also caused a split in the [British suffragette\nmovement](/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Women's suffrage in\nthe United Kingdom\"), with the mainstream, represented by [Emmeline\nPankhurst](/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst \"Emmeline Pankhurst\") and her daughter\n[Christabel](/wiki/Christabel_Pankhurst \"Christabel Pankhurst\")'s [Women's\nSocial and Political Union](/wiki/Women%27s_Social_and_Political_Union\n\"Women's Social and Political Union\"), calling a '[ceasefire](/wiki/Ceasefire\n\"Ceasefire\")' in their campaign for the duration of the war. In contrast, more\n[radical](/wiki/Extremism \"Extremism\") suffragettes, like the [Women's\nSuffrage Federation](/wiki/Women%27s_Suffrage_Federation \"Women's Suffrage\nFederation\") run by Emmeline's other daughter, [Sylvia](/wiki/Sylvia_Pankhurst\n\"Sylvia Pankhurst\"), continued their (at times violent) struggle. Women were\nalso allowed to join the armed forces in a non-combatant role[12] and by the\nend of the War 80,000 women had joined the armed forces in auxiliary roles\nsuch as nursing and cooking.[149]\n\nFollowing the war, millions of returning soldiers were still not entitled to\nvote.[150] This posed another dilemma for politicians since they could be seen\nto be withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve\nthe British democratic political system. The [Representation of the People Act\n1918](/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1918 \"Representation of the\nPeople Act 1918\") attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising all adult\nmales as long as they were over 21 years old and were resident\nhouseholders.[150] It also gave the vote to women over 30 who met minimum\nproperty qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted\nas recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers,[150] though\nthe actual feelings of [members of\nparliament](/wiki/Members_of_parliament#United_Kingdom \"Members of\nparliament\") (MPs) at the time is questioned.[12] In the same year the\n[Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act\n1918](/wiki/Parliament_\\(Qualification_of_Women\\)_Act_1918 \"Parliament\n\\(Qualification of Women\\) Act 1918\") allowed women over 21 to stand as\nMPs.[151]\n\nThe new coalition government of 1918 charged itself with the task of creating\na \"land fit for heroes\", from a speech given in\n[Wolverhampton](/wiki/Wolverhampton \"Wolverhampton\") by David Lloyd George on\n23 November 1918, where he stated \"What is our task? To make Britain a fit\ncountry for heroes to live in.\"[152] More generally, the war has been\ncredited, both during and after the conflict, with removing some of the social\nbarriers that had pervaded Victorian and Edwardian Britain.[6]\n\n## Regional\nconditions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Regional conditions\")]\n\nThe War had a profound influence upon rural areas, as the U-boat blockade\nrequired the government to take full control of the food chain, as well as\nagricultural labour. Cereal production was a high priority, and the [Corn\nProduction Act 1917](/wiki/Corn_Production_Act_1917 \"Corn Production Act\n1917\") guaranteed prices, regulated wage rates, and required farmers to meet\nefficiency standards. The government campaigned heavily for turning marginal\nland into cropland.[153][154][155] The [Women's Land\nArmy](/wiki/Women%27s_Land_Army \"Women's Land Army\") brought in 23,000 young\nwomen from the towns and cities to milk cows, pick fruit and otherwise replace\nthe men who joined the services.[156] More extensive use of tractors and\nmachinery also replaced farm labourers. However, there was a shortage of both\nmen and horses on the land by late 1915. County [War Agricultural Executive\nCommittees](/wiki/War_Agricultural_Executive_Committee \"War Agricultural\nExecutive Committee\") reported that the continued removal of men was\nundercutting food production because of the farmers' belief that operating a\nfarm required a set number of men and horses.[157]\n\n[Kenneth Morgan](/wiki/Kenneth_O._Morgan \"Kenneth O. Morgan\") argues that,\n\"the overwhelming mass of the Welsh people cast aside their political and\nindustrial divisions and threw themselves into the war with gusto.\"\nIntellectuals and ministers actively promoted the war spirit. With 280,000 men\nenrolled in the services (14% of the population), the proportionate effort in\nWales outstripped both England and Scotland.[158] However Adrian Gregory\npoints out that the Welsh coal miners, while officially supporting the war\neffort, refused the government request to cut short their vacation time. After\nsome debate, the miners agreed to extend the working day.[159]\n\nScotland's distinctive characteristics have attracted significant attention\nfrom scholars.[160] Daniel Coetzee shows it supported the war effort with\nwidespread enthusiasm.[161]\n\n##\nCasualties[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Casualties\")]\n\nSee also: [World War I casualties](/wiki/World_War_I_casualties \"World War I\ncasualties\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f4/National_Fund_for_Welsh_Troops2.jpg/220px-\nNational_Fund_for_Welsh_Troops2.jpg)](/wiki/File:National_Fund_for_Welsh_Troops2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:National_Fund_for_Welsh_Troops2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPoster for a fundraising event in support of Welsh troops by [Frank\nBrangwyn](/wiki/Frank_Brangwyn \"Frank Brangwyn\")\n\nIn the post war publication _Statistics of the Military Effort of the British\nEmpire During the Great War 1914–1920_ ([The War Office](/wiki/War_Office \"War\nOffice\"), March 1922), the official report lists 908,371 'soldiers' as being\neither [killed in action](/wiki/Killed_in_action \"Killed in action\"), dying of\nwounds, dying as [prisoners of war](/wiki/Prisoner_of_war \"Prisoner of war\")\nor missing in action in the World War.

The post-war world had many veterans who were maimed or damaged by\nshell shock. In 1921 1,187,450 men were in receipt of pensions for war\ndisabilities, with a fifth of these having suffered serious loss of limbs or\neyesight, paralysis or lunacy.[169]\n\nThe war was a major economic catastrophe as Britain went from being the\nworld's largest overseas investor to being its biggest debtor, with interest\npayments consuming around 40 percent of the national budget.[170] Inflation\nmore than doubled between 1914 and its peak in 1920, while the value of the\nPound Sterling fell by 61.2 percent. Reparations in the form of free German\ncoal depressed the local industry, precipitating the [1926 General\nStrike](/wiki/UK_General_Strike_1926 \"UK General Strike 1926\").[170] During\nthe war British private investments abroad were sold, raising £550 million.\nHowever, £250 million new investment also took place during the war. The net\nfinancial loss was therefore approximately £300 million; less than two years\ninvestment compared to the pre-war average rate and more than replaced by\n1928.[171] Material loss was \"slight\": the most significant being 40 percent\nof the British merchant fleet sunk by German U-boats. Most of this was\nreplaced in 1918 and all immediately after the war.[172] The military\nhistorian [Correlli Barnett](/wiki/Correlli_Barnett \"Correlli Barnett\") has\nargued that \"in objective truth the Great War in no way inflicted crippling\neconomic damage on Britain\" but that the war only \"crippled the British\n_psychologically_ \" (emphasis in original).[173]\n\nLess concrete changes include the growing assertiveness of the\n[Dominions](/wiki/British_Dominions \"British Dominions\") within the British\nEmpire.

Britain was to face unrest in Ireland (1919–21), India (1919),\nEgypt (1919–23), Palestine (1920–21) and Iraq (1920) at a time when they were\nsupposed to be demilitarising.[17] Nevertheless, Britain's only territorial\nloss came in Ireland,[17] where the delay in finding a resolution to the [home\nrule](/wiki/Home_rule \"Home rule\") issue, along with the 1916 [Easter\nRising](/wiki/Easter_Rising \"Easter Rising\") and a failed attempt to introduce\n[conscription in Ireland](/wiki/Conscription_Crisis_of_1918 \"Conscription\nCrisis of 1918\"), increased support for separatist radicals, and led\nindirectly to the outbreak of the [Irish War of\nIndependence](/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence \"Irish War of Independence\") in\n1919.[175]\n\nFurther change came in 1919. With the [Treaty of\nVersailles](/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles \"Treaty of Versailles\"), London took\ncharge of an additional 1,800,000 square miles (4,700,000 km2) and 13 million\nnew subjects.[176] The colonies of Germany and the [Ottoman\nEmpire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman Empire\") were distributed to the Allied\npowers (and to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa) as [League of Nations\nmandates](/wiki/League_of_Nations_mandate \"League of Nations mandate\"), with\nthe United Kingdom at least gaining control of [Palestine and\nTransjordan](/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine \"British Mandate of\nPalestine\"), [Iraq](/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Mesopotamia \"British Mandate of\nMesopotamia\"), parts of [Cameroon](/wiki/Cameroons \"Cameroons\") and\n[Togo](/wiki/Togo \"Togo\"), and [Tanganyika](/wiki/Tanganyika\n\"Tanganyika\").[177] Indeed, the British Empire reached its territorial peak\nafter the settlement.[17]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Fokker_Dr._I_%28117710246%29.jpg/32px-Fokker_Dr._I_%28117710246%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Fokker_Dr._I_\\(117710246\\).jpg)[World War I portal](/wiki/Portal:World_War_I \"Portal:World War I\")\n\n  * [Diplomatic history of World War I](/wiki/Diplomatic_history_of_World_War_I \"Diplomatic history of World War I\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Foreign Office, \"A State of War,\" August 4, 1914, Supplement to the London Gazette no. 28861 (August 5, 1914): 6161\"](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28861/).\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Foreign Office, Notice of State of War Between Great Britain and Austria-Hungary, August 12, 1914, Supplement to the London Gazette no. 28868 (August 13, 1914): 6375\"](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28868/supplement/6375/data.pdf) (PDF).\n  3. **Jump up ^** [\"Foreign Office, Notice of State of War Between Great Britain and Turkey, November 5, 1914, London Gazette no. 28965 (November 6, 1914): 9011\"](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28965/page/9011).\n  4. **Jump up ^** [\"Foreign Office, Notice of State of War Between Great Britain and Bulgaria, October 15, 1915, London Gazette no. 29333 (October 19, 1915): 10257–58\"](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/29333/page/10257).\n  5. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ [Tucker, Spencer C.](/wiki/Spencer_C._Tucker \"Spencer C.
