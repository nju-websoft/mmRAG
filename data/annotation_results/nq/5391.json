Lady enjoys a happy life\nwith the couple and befriends two local neighborhood dogs, Jock, a [Scottish\nterrier](/wiki/Scottish_terrier \"Scottish terrier\"), and Trusty, a\n[bloodhound](/wiki/Bloodhound \"Bloodhound\"). Meanwhile, across town, a stray\nmongrel called the Tramp lives on his own, dining on scraps from Tony's\n[Italian restaurant](/wiki/Italian_cuisine \"Italian cuisine\") and protecting\nhis fellow strays Peg (a [Pekingese](/wiki/Pekingese \"Pekingese\")) and Bull (a\n[bulldog](/wiki/Bulldog \"Bulldog\")) from the local\n[dogcatcher](/wiki/Animal_control_officer \"Animal control officer\"). One day,\nLady is saddened after her owners begin treating her rather coldly. Jock and\nTrusty visit her and determine that their change in behavior is due to Darling\nexpecting a baby. While Jock and Trusty try to explain what a baby is, Tramp\ninterrupts the conversation and offers his own thoughts on the matter, making\nJock and Trusty take an immediate dislike to the stray and order him out of\nthe yard. As Tramp leaves, he reminds Lady that \"when the baby moves in, the\ndog moves out.\"\n\nEventually, the baby arrives and the couple introduces Lady to the infant, of\nwhom Lady grows fond. Soon after, Jim Dear and Darling leave for a trip, with\ntheir Aunt Sarah looking after the baby and the house. Aunt Sarah's two\ntrouble-making Siamese cats, Si and Am, deliberately mess up the house and\ntrick her into thinking that Lady attacked them. Aunt Sarah then takes Lady to\na pet shop to get a muzzle. Terrifed, Lady flees, only to be pursued by a trio\nof stray dogs. Tramp rescues her, fighting off the vicious strays, and finds a\n[beaver](/wiki/Beaver \"Beaver\") at the local zoo who can remove the muzzle.\nLater, Tramp shows Lady how he lives \"footloose and collar-free\", eventually\nleading into a candlelit dinner at Tony's. Lady begins to fall in love with\nTramp, but she chooses to return home in order to watch over the baby. Tramp\noffers to escort Lady back home, but when Tramp decides to chase hens around a\nfarmyard for fun, Lady is captured by the dog catcher and brought to the local\ndog pound. While at the pound, the other dogs (including Peg and Bull, who\nhave been caught) reveal to Lady that Tramp previously had multiple\ngirlfriends and feel it is unlikely he will ever settle down. Lady is\neventually claimed by Aunt Sarah, who chains her in the backyard as punishment\nfor running away.\n\nJock and Trusty visit to comfort Lady, but when Tramp arrives to apologize,\nLady angrily confronts him about his past girlfriends and failure to rescue\nher from the pound. Tramp sadly leaves, but immediately thereafter a rat\nsneaks into the house. Lady sees the rat and barks frantically at it, but Aunt\nSarah tells her to be quiet. Tramp hears her barking and rushes back, entering\nthe house and cornering the rat in the nursery. Lady breaks free and rushes to\nthe nursery, where Tramp inadvertently knocks over the baby's crib before\nultimately killing the rat. The commotion alerts Aunt Sarah, who sees both\ndogs in the room and thinks they are trying to harm the baby. She pushes Tramp\nin a closet and locks Lady in the basement, then calls the pound to take Tramp\naway. Jim Dear and Darling return home as the dog catcher departs, and when\nthey release Lady, she leads them to the dead rat. Overhearing everything,\nJock and Trusty chase after the dog catcher's wagon. The dogs are able to\ntrack down the wagon and scare the horses, causing the wagon to crash. Jim\nDear arrives in a taxi with Lady, and she reunites with Tramp, but their joy\nis short-lived when they find Trusty pinned underneath the wagon's wheel,\nmotionless, with Jock howling mournfully.\n\nThat Christmas, Tramp has been adopted into the family, and he and Lady have\nstarted their own family, with three daughters who look like Lady and [a son\nwho looks similar to Tramp](/wiki/Scamp_\\(comics\\) \"Scamp \\(comics\\)\"). Jock\ncomes to see the family along with Trusty, who is still alive and merely\nsuffered a broken leg, which is still healing. Thanks to the puppies, Trusty\nhas a fresh audience for his old stories about his Grandpappy Old Reliable,\nbut he has forgotten them.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * [Barbara Luddy](/wiki/Barbara_Luddy \"Barbara Luddy\") as Lady, an [American Cocker Spaniel](/wiki/American_Cocker_Spaniel \"American Cocker Spaniel\").\n  * [Larry Roberts](/wiki/Larry_Roberts_\\(actor\\) \"Larry Roberts \\(actor\\)\") as Tramp, a [mongrel](/wiki/Mongrel \"Mongrel\") with a knack for dodging dog-catchers and the ability to pick locks with his nose. He calls Lady \"Pidge\", short for Pigeon.\n  * [Bill Thompson](/wiki/Bill_Thompson_\\(voice_actor\\) \"Bill Thompson \\(voice actor\\)\") as Jock, a [Scottish Terrier](/wiki/Scottish_Terrier \"Scottish Terrier\") who is one of Lady's neighbors. Thompson also voiced Joe, Tony's assistant chef; Bull, a stray male [bulldog](/wiki/Bulldog \"Bulldog\") from the dog pound who speaks with a slight Cockney-Australian accent; Dachsie, a stray male [dachshund](/wiki/Dachshund \"Dachshund\") at the dog pound who speaks with a German accent; and a policeman.\n  * Bill Baucom as Trusty, a [bloodhound](/wiki/Bloodhound \"Bloodhound\") who used to track criminals with his Grandpappy, Old Reliable, until he lost his sense of smell.\n  * [Verna Felton](/wiki/Verna_Felton \"Verna Felton\") as Aunt Sarah, Darling's sister who comes to take care of the baby when Jim Dear and Darling leave for a few days. Aunt Sarah is strict; she does not understand dogs and thinks they are trouble. She blames both Lady and Tramp for the baby's crib being knocked over, not knowing that they were actually protecting the baby from a vicious rat. However, she sends a box of dog biscuits in the final scene of the film in a presumed attempt to make amends for her mistreatment of the two dogs.\n  * [George Givot](/wiki/George_Givot \"George Givot\") as Tony, owner and chef of Tony's [Italian restaurant](/wiki/Italian_cuisine \"Italian cuisine\"). He and Joe both have great affection for Tramp.\n  * Lee Millar as Jim Dear, the fatherly human figure and Darling's husband. Millar also voiced the Dogcatcher.\n  * [Peggy Lee](/wiki/Peggy_Lee \"Peggy Lee\") as Darling, the motherly human figure and Jim Dear's wife. Lee also voiced Si and Am, Aunt's Sarah's twin [Siamese cats](/wiki/Siamese_cat \"Siamese cat\") with a knack for mischief and never-ending trouble; and Peg, a stray female [Pekingese](/wiki/Pekingese \"Pekingese\") whom Lady meets at the pound (along with the other dog inmates she was put in a cage with). The names of Si and Am are a play on the country of [Siam](/wiki/Siam \"Siam\") and the idea of \"Siamese twins\", the terminology of the time for [conjoined twins](/wiki/Conjoined_twins \"Conjoined twins\"). It is implied that Peg had a relationship with Tramp in the past, through the lyrics of the song she sings (_He 's a Tramp_). Peg was formerly from the \"Dog and Pony Follies\" ([dog and pony show](/wiki/Dog_and_pony_show \"Dog and pony show\")); either the show ended or she was left behind. Peg has a [Brooklyn Accent](/wiki/New_York_Dialect \"New York Dialect\").\n  * [Stan Freberg](/wiki/Stan_Freberg \"Stan Freberg\") as the beaver, a clever, hard-working beaver at the zoo who speaks with a lisp. He gnaws off the muzzle that Aunt Sarah had placed upon Lady after Tramp realizes that the muzzle is just what the beaver needs for pulling logs. This character would later serve as the inspiration for [Gopher](/wiki/Gopher_\\(Winnie-the-Pooh\\) \"Gopher \\(Winnie-the-Pooh\\)\") from _[Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree](/wiki/Winnie_the_Pooh_and_the_Honey_Tree \"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\")_.\n  * [Alan Reed](/wiki/Alan_Reed \"Alan Reed\") as Boris, a stray male [Borzoi](/wiki/Borzoi \"Borzoi\") from the dog pound.

He speaks with a slight Brooklyn accent, like Peg. McKennon also voiced Pedro, a stray male [Chihuahua](/wiki/Chihuahua_\\(dog\\) \"Chihuahua \\(dog\\)\") from the dog pound who speaks with a Mexican accent; a professor, and a laughing hyena.\n  * [The Mellomen](/wiki/The_Mellomen \"The Mellomen\") ([Thurl Ravenscroft](/wiki/Thurl_Ravenscroft \"Thurl Ravenscroft\"), [Bill Lee](/wiki/Bill_Lee_\\(singer\\) \"Bill Lee \\(singer\\)\"), Max Smith, Bob Hamlin and Bob Stevens) as Dog Chorus\n\n## Production\n\n### Story development\n\nIn 1937, Disney story man [Joe Grant](/wiki/Joe_Grant \"Joe Grant\") came up\nwith an idea inspired by the antics of his [English Springer\nSpaniel](/wiki/English_Springer_Spaniel \"English Springer Spaniel\") Lady, and\nhow she got \"shoved aside\" by Joe's new baby. He approached Walt Disney with\nsketches of Lady. Disney enjoyed the sketches and commissioned Grant to start\nstory development on a new animated feature entitled _Lady_.[4] Through the\nlate 1930s and early 1940s, Joe Grant and other artists worked on the story,\ntaking a variety of approaches, but Disney was not pleased with any of them,\nprimarily because he thought Lady was too sweet, and there was not enough\naction.[4]\n\nIn the early 1940s, Walt read the short story written by Ward Greene, \"[Happy\nDan, The Whistling Dog](/wiki/Happy_Dan,_The_Whistling_Dog \"Happy Dan, The\nWhistling Dog\")\", in _[Cosmopolitan](/wiki/Cosmopolitan_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Cosmopolitan \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine.[5] He thought Grant's story would be\nimproved if Lady fell in love with a cynical dog character like the one in\nGreene's story and bought the rights to it.[6] The cynical dog had various\nnames during development, including Homer, Rags, and Bozo, before \"Tramp\" was\nchosen.[5]\n\nThe finished film is slightly different from what was originally planned. Lady\nwas to have only one next-door neighbor, a [Ralph Bellamy](/wiki/Ralph_Bellamy\n\"Ralph Bellamy\")-type canine named Hubert. Hubert was later replaced by Jock\nand Trusty. Aunt Sarah was the traditional overbearing mother-in-law. In the\nfinal film, she is softened to a busybody. Aunt Sarah's Nip and Tuck were\nlater renamed Si and Am.[5] Originally, Lady's owners were called Jim Brown\nand Elizabeth. These were changed to highlight Lady's point of view. They were\nbriefly referred to as \"Mister\" and \"Missis\" before settling on the names \"Jim\nDear\" and \"Darling\". To maintain a dog's\n[perspective](/wiki/Perspective_\\(visual\\) \"Perspective \\(visual\\)\"), Darling\nand Jim's faces are rarely shown, similar to [Mammy Two\nShoes](/wiki/Mammy_Two_Shoes \"Mammy Two Shoes\") in the _[Tom and\nJerry](/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry \"Tom and Jerry\")_ cartoons. The rat was a somewhat\ncomic character in early sketches, but became a great deal more frightening,\ndue to the need to raise dramatic tension. A scene created but then deleted\nwas one in which after Trusty says \"Everybody knows, a dog's best friend is\nhis human\", Tramp describes a world in which the roles of both dogs and humans\nare switched; the dogs are the masters and vice versa.[4] There was a love\ntriangle among Lady, Tramp, and a [Russian wolfhound](/wiki/Russian_wolfhound\n\"Russian wolfhound\") named Boris (who appears in the dog pound in the final\nversion).[7]\n\nThe film's opening sequence, in which Darling unwraps a hat box on Christmas\nmorning and finds Lady inside, is inspired by an incident when Walt Disney\npresented his wife Lily with a [Chow](/wiki/Chow_chow \"Chow chow\") puppy as a\ngift in a hat box.[8]\n\nIn 1949, Grant left the studio, yet Disney story men were continually pulling\nGrant's original drawings and story off the shelf to retool.[4] A solid story\nbegan taking shape in 1953,[6] based on Grant's storyboards and Greene's short\nstory.[4] Greene later wrote a [novelization](/wiki/Novelization\n\"Novelization\") of the film that was released two years before the film\nitself, at [Walt Disney](/wiki/Walt_Disney \"Walt Disney\")'s insistence, so\nthat audiences would be familiar with the story.[9] Grant did not receive film\ncredit for his story work, an issue that animation director [Eric\nGoldberg](/wiki/Eric_Goldberg_\\(film_director\\) \"Eric Goldberg \\(film\ndirector\\)\") hoped to rectify in the _Lady and the Tramp_ Platinum Edition's\nbehind-the-scenes vignette that explained Grant's role.[4]\n\nSinger [Peggy Lee](/wiki/Peggy_Lee \"Peggy Lee\") not only voiced four\ncharacters but co-wrote six songs for the movie.[10]\n\n### Animation\n\nAs they had done with deer on _[Bambi](/wiki/Bambi \"Bambi\")_ , the animators\nstudied many dogs of different breeds to capture the movement and personality\nof dogs. Although the spaghetti eating sequence is probably now the best known\nscene from the film, Walt Disney was prepared to cut it, thinking that it\nwould not be romantic and that dogs eating spaghetti would look silly.\nAnimator [Frank Thomas](/wiki/Frank_Thomas_\\(animator\\) \"Frank Thomas\n\\(animator\\)\") was against Walt's decision and animated the entire scene\nhimself without any lay-outs. Walt was impressed by Thomas's work and how he\nromanticized the scene and kept the scene in.[4] On viewing the first take of\nthe scene, the animators felt that the action should be slowed down, so an\napprentice trainee was assigned to create \"half numbers\" in between many of\nthe original frames.[11]\n\nOriginally, the background artist was supposed to be [Mary\nBlair](/wiki/Mary_Blair \"Mary Blair\") and she did some inspirational sketches\nfor the film. However, she left the studio to become a children's book\nillustrator in 1953. Claude Coats was then appointed as the key background\nartist. Coats made models of the interiors of Jim Dear and Darling's house,\nand shot photos and film at a low perspective as reference to maintain a dog's\nview.[9] Eyvind Earle (who later became the art director of Disney's\n_[Sleeping Beauty](/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_\\(1959_film\\) \"Sleeping Beauty \\(1959\nfilm\\)\")_) did almost 50 miniature concept sketches for the Bella Notte\nsequence and was a key contributor to the film.[9]\n\n#### CinemaScope\n\nFurther information: [CinemaScope](/wiki/CinemaScope \"CinemaScope\")\n\nOriginally, _Lady and the Tramp_ was planned to be filmed in a regular [full\nframe](/wiki/Full_frame \"Full frame\") [aspect\nratio](/wiki/Aspect_ratio_\\(image\\) \"Aspect ratio \\(image\\)\"). However, due to\nthe growing interest of [widescreen](/wiki/Widescreen \"Widescreen\") film among\nmovie-goers, Disney decided to animate the film in\n[CinemaScope](/wiki/CinemaScope \"CinemaScope\") making _Lady and the Tramp_ the\nfirst animated feature filmed in the process.[5] This new innovation presented\nadditional problems for the animators: the expansion of space created more\nrealism but gave fewer closeups.[6] It also made it difficult for a single\ncharacter to dominate the screen so that groups had to be spread out to keep\nthe screen from appearing sparse.[5] Longer takes become necessary since\nconstant jump-cutting would seem too busy or annoying.[3] Layout artists\nessentially had to reinvent their technique. Animators had to remember that\nthey had to move their characters across a background instead of the\nbackground passing behind them.[6] Yet the animators overcame these obstacles\nduring the action scenes, such as Tramp killing the rat.[3]\n\nMore problems arose as the premiere date got closer since not all theaters had\nthe capability to show CinemaScope at the time. Upon learning this, Walt\nissued two versions of the film: one in widescreen, and another in the\n[Academy ratio](/wiki/Academy_ratio \"Academy ratio\"). This involved gathering\nthe layout artists to restructure key scenes when characters were on the edges\nof the screen.[12]\n\n## Release\n\n_Lady and the Tramp_ was originally released to theaters on June 22, 1955. An\nepisode of _[Disneyland](/wiki/Walt_Disney_anthology_television_series \"Walt\nDisney anthology television series\")_ called \"A Story of Dogs\" aired before\nthe film's release.[13] The film was also reissued to theaters in 1962, 1972,\n1980, and 1986. _Lady and the Tramp_ also played a limited engagement in\nselect [Cinemark Theatres](/wiki/Cinemark_Theatres \"Cinemark Theatres\") from\nFebruary 16–18, 2013.[14]\n\n### Home media\n\n_Lady and the Tramp_ was first released on North American VHS and\n[Laserdisc](/wiki/Laserdisc \"Laserdisc\") in 1987 as part of the [Walt Disney\nClassics](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Classics \"Walt Disney Classics\") video series and\nin the UK in 1990. It was released on VHS in 1998 as part of the [Walt Disney\nMasterpiece Collection](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Masterpiece_Collection \"Walt Disney\nMasterpiece Collection\") video series. A Disney Limited Issue series DVD of\nthe film was released on November 23, 1999.\n\nAfter the first release on video tapes, Peggy Lee sought performance and song\nroyalties on the video sales. Disney CEO Eisner refused, thus she filed suite\nin 1988. Eventually in 1992, the California Court of Appeals order Disney to\npay Lee $3.2 million in compensation or about a 4% on the video sales.[10]\n\n_Lady and the Tramp_ was remastered and restored for DVD on February 28, 2006,\nas the seventh installment of Disney's [Platinum\nEditions](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Platinum_and_Diamond_Editions \"Walt Disney\nPlatinum and Diamond Editions\") series.[15] One million copies of the Platinum\nEdition were sold on February 28, 2006.[16] The Platinum Edition DVD went on\nmoratorium on January 31, 2007, along with the 2006 DVD reissue of the film's\nsequel _[Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's\nAdventure](/wiki/Lady_and_the_Tramp_II:_Scamp%27s_Adventure \"Lady and the\nTramp II: Scamp's Adventure\")_.[17]\n\n_Lady and the Tramp_ was released on [Blu-ray](/wiki/Blu-ray \"Blu-ray\") on\nFebruary 7, 2012 as a part of Disney's [Diamond\nEditions](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Platinum_and_Diamond_Editions#Diamond_Editions\n\"Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions\") series.[18] A standalone 1-disc\nDVD edition was released on March 20, 2012.[19][20]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical reception\n\nDespite being an enormous success at the box office, the film was also\ninitially panned by critics; one indicated that the dogs had \"the dimensions\nof hippos\", another that \"the artists' work is below par\".[21]\n\nHowever, the film has since gone on to become regarded as a classic. The\nsequence of Lady and Tramp sharing a plate of spaghetti — climaxed by an\naccidental kiss as they swallow opposite ends of the same strand of spaghetti\n— is considered an iconic scene in American film history.[22]\n\n_Lady and the Tramp_ was named number 95 out of the \"100 Greatest Love Stories\nof All Time\" by the American Film Institute in their _100 Years...100\nPassions_ special, as one of only two animated films to appear on the list,\nalong with Disney's _Beauty and the Beast_ which ranked 34th.[23] In 2010,\nRhapsody called its accompanying soundtrack one of the all-time great Disney\nand Pixar soundtracks.[24] In June 2011, _TIME_ named it one of \"The 25 All-\nTIME Best Animated Films\".[25]\n\nThe [review aggregator](/wiki/Review_aggregator \"Review aggregator\") website\nRotten Tomatoes reported that the film received a 90% approval rating, with an\naverage rating of 7.7/10, based on 40 reviews. The website's consensus states,\n\"A nostalgic charmer, _Lady and the Tramp_ 's token sweetness is mighty but\nthe songs and richly colored animation are technically superb and make for a\nmemorable experience.\"[26]\n\n### Box office\n\nIn its initial release, the film took in a higher figure than any other Disney\nanimated feature since _[Snow White and the Seven\nDwarfs](/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_\\(1937_film\\) \"Snow White and\nthe Seven Dwarfs \\(1937 film\\)\")_ ,[27] earning an estimated $7.5 million in\nrentals at the North American box office in 1955.[28]\n\nThe film is France's 22nd biggest film of all time in terms of admissions with\n11.2 million tickets sold.[29]\n\nThe film has grossed $93.6 million in the United States and Canada [1] and\n$187 million worldwide.[2]\n\n### Accolades\n\nYear | Ceremony | Award | Result  \n---|---|---|---  \n1956 | BAFTA Awards[30] | Best Animated Film | Nominated  \nDavid di Donatello Awards[31] | Best Foreign Producer  \n(Walt Disney)  \n| Won  \n2006 | Satellite Awards[32] | Best Youth DVD | Nominated  \n  \nAmerican Film Institute Lists\n\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies – Nominated[33]\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions – No. 95\n  * AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs: \n    * He's a Tramp – Nominated[34]\n  * AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated[35]\n  * AFI's 10 Top 10 – Nominated Animated Film[36]\n\n## Music\n\nLady and the Tramp  \n---  \n[Soundtrack album](/wiki/Soundtrack_album \"Soundtrack album\") by Various\nartists  \nReleased | 9 September 1997  \n[Genre](/wiki/Music_genre \"Music genre\") | Classical  \nLength | 48:00  \n[Label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\") | [Walt Disney](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Records \"Walt Disney Records\")  \n[Producer](/wiki/Record_producer \"Record producer\") | Ted Kryczko (executive)  \nProfessional ratings  \n---  \nReview scores  \nSource | Rating  \n[AllMusic](/wiki/AllMusic \"AllMusic\") | ![4.5/5 stars](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Star_half.svg/11px-Star_half.svg.png)[37]  \n  \nThe score for the film was composed and conducted by [Oliver\nWallace](/wiki/Oliver_Wallace \"Oliver Wallace\").
