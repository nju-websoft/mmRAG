This computer was destroyed in the bombardment\nof Berlin in December 1943, during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World\nWar II\"), together with all construction plans.\n\nThe Z1 was the first in a series of computers that Zuse designed. Its original\nname was \"V1\" for VersuchsModell 1 (meaning Experimental Model 1). After WW2,\nit was renamed \"Z1\" to differentiate from the [flying\nbombs](/wiki/V-1_flying_bomb \"V-1 flying bomb\") designed by [Robert\nLusser](/wiki/Robert_Lusser \"Robert Lusser\").[5] The\n[Z2](/wiki/Z2_\\(computer\\) \"Z2 \\(computer\\)\") and [Z3](/wiki/Z3_\\(computer\\)\n\"Z3 \\(computer\\)\") were follow-ups based on many of the same ideas as the Z1.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Design\n  * 2 Construction\n  * 3 Reconstruction\n  * 4 Quotation\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 Further reading\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Design[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Z1_\\(computer\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Design\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Zuse_Patent_907948.jpg/220px-\nZuse_Patent_907948.jpg)](/wiki/File:Zuse_Patent_907948.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Zuse_Patent_907948.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDiagrams from Zuse's May 1936 patent for a binary switching element using a\nmechanism of flat sliding rods. The Z1 was based on such elements.\n\nThe Z1 contained almost all the parts of a modern computer, i.e. control unit,\nmemory, micro sequences, [floating-point](/wiki/Floating-point \"Floating-\npoint\") logic and input–output devices. The Z1 was freely programmable via\npunched tape and a punched tape reader.[6] There was a clear separation\nbetween the punched tape reader, the control unit for supervising the whole\nmachine and the execution of the instructions, the arithmetic unit, and the\ninput and output devices. The input tape unit read perforations in\n35-millimeter film.[7]\n\nThe Z1 was a 22-bit [floating-point](/wiki/Floating-point \"Floating-point\")\nvalue adder and subtracter, with some control logic to make it capable of more\ncomplex operations such as multiplication (by repeated additions) and division\n(by repeated subtractions). The Z1's [instruction set](/wiki/Instruction_set\n\"Instruction set\") had nine instructions and it took between one and twenty\n[cycles per instruction](/wiki/Cycles_per_instruction \"Cycles per\ninstruction\").\n\nThe Z1 had a 64-word floating-point memory, where each word of memory could be\nread from – and written to – by the control unit. The mechanical memory units\nwere unique in their design and were patented by Konrad Zuse in 1936. The\nmachine was only capable of executing instructions while reading from the\n[punched tape](/wiki/Punched_tape \"Punched tape\") reader, so the program\nitself was not loaded in its entirety into internal memory in advance.\n\nThe input and output were in decimal numbers, with a decimal exponent and the\nunits had special machinery for converting these to and from binary numbers.\nThe input and output instructions would be read or written as floating-point\nnumbers. The program tape was 35 mm film with the instructions encoded in\npunched holes.\n\n##\nConstruction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Z1_\\(computer\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Construction\")]\n\n\"Z1 was a machine of about 1000 kg weight, which consisted from some 20000\nparts. It was a programmable computer, based on binary floating-point numbers\nand a binary switching system. It consisted completely of thin metal sheets,\nwhich Zuse and his friends produced using a jigsaw.\"[8] \"The [data] input\ndevice was a keyboard...The Z1’s programs (Zuse called them Rechenpläne) were\nstored on punch tapes by means of an 8-bit code\"[8]\n\nConstruction of the Z1 was privately financed. Zuse got money from his\nparents, his sister Lieselotte, some students of the fraternity _AV Motiv_\n(cf. [Helmut Schreyer](/wiki/Helmut_Schreyer \"Helmut Schreyer\")) and Kurt\nPannke (a calculating machines manufacturer in Berlin) to do so.\n\nZuse constructed the Z1 in his parents' apartment; in fact, he was allowed to\nuse the living room for his construction. In 1936, Zuse quit his job in\nairplane construction in order to build the Z1.\n\nZuse is said to have used \"thin metal strips\" and perhaps \"metal cylinders\" or\nglass plates to construct Z1. There were probably no commercial relays in it\n(although the Z3 is said to have used a few telephone relays). The only\nelectrical unit was an electric motor to give the [clock\nfrequency](/wiki/Clock_frequency \"Clock frequency\") of 1 [Hz](/wiki/Hertz\n\"Hertz\") (cycle per second) to the machine.\n\n'The memory was constructed from thin strips of slotted metal and small pins,\nand proved faster, smaller, and more reliable, than relays. The Z2 used the\nmechanical memory of the Z1, but used relay-based arithmetic. The Z3 was\nexperimentally built entirely of relays. The Z4 was the first attempt at a\ncommercial computer, reverting to the faster and more economical mechanical\nslotted metal strip memory, with relay processing, of the Z2, but the war\ninterrupted the Z4 development.'[9]\n\nThe Z1 was never very reliable in operation due to poor synchronization due to\ninternal and external stresses on the mechanical parts.\n\n##\nReconstruction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Z1_\\(computer\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Reconstruction\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Zuse_Z1.jpg/220px-\nZuse_Z1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Zuse_Z1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Zuse_Z1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nReconstruction of Z1\n\nThe original Z1 was destroyed by the [Allied air raids in\n1943](/wiki/Bombing_of_Berlin_in_World_War_II \"Bombing of Berlin in World War\nII\"), but in 1986 Zuse decided to rebuild the machine. He constructed\nthousands of elements of the Z1 again, and finished rebuilding the device in\n1989. The rebuilt Z1 (pictured) is displayed at the [German Museum of\nTechnology](/wiki/German_Museum_of_Technology \"German Museum of Technology\")\nin Berlin.\n\n## Quotation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Z1_\\(computer\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Quotation\")]\n\n    \n\n    [Konrad Zuse](/wiki/Konrad_Zuse \"Konrad Zuse\"): \"There is a replica of this Model in the [Museum of Traffic and Technology](/wiki/German_Museum_of_Technology \"German Museum of Technology\") in Berlin.
