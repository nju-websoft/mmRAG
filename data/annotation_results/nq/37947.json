The earliest sale on the list\n(_[Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers](/wiki/Sunflowers_\\(Van_Gogh_series\\)\n\"Sunflowers \\(Van Gogh series\\)\")_ by [Vincent van\nGogh](/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh \"Vincent van Gogh\")) is from 1987, and more than\ntripled the previous record price, set only two years before, introducing a\nnew era in top picture prices. The sale was also significant in that for the\nfirst time a \"modern\" painting (in this case from 1888) became the record\nholder, as opposed to the [old master paintings](/wiki/Old_master_painting\n\"Old master painting\") which had always previously held it. The current record\nprice is approximately [$](/wiki/United_States_dollar \"United States\ndollar\")450 million paid for [Leonardo Da Vinci's](/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci\n\"Leonardo da Vinci\") [_Salvator Mundi_](/wiki/Salvator_Mundi_\\(Leonardo\\)\n\"Salvator Mundi \\(Leonardo\\)\") in November 2017.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Van Gogh, Picasso, and Warhol\n  * 3 Interactive graph\n  * 4 List of highest prices paid\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 Notes\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_most_expensive_paintings&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nThe world's most famous paintings, especially old master works done before\n1803, are generally owned or held at [museums](/wiki/Museum \"Museum\"), for\nviewing by patrons. The museums very rarely sell them, and as such, they are\nquite literally priceless. _[Guinness World\nRecords](/wiki/Guinness_World_Records \"Guinness World Records\")_ lists the\n_[Mona Lisa](/wiki/Mona_Lisa \"Mona Lisa\")_ as having the highest\n[insurance](/wiki/Insurance \"Insurance\") value for a painting in history. On\npermanent display at [The Louvre](/wiki/The_Louvre \"The Louvre\") museum in\nParis, the _Mona Lisa_ was assessed at US$100 million on December 14, 1962.\nTaking [inflation](/wiki/Inflation \"Inflation\") into account, the 1962 value\nwould be around US$790 million in 2016.[1]\n\nThe earliest sale on the list below (_[Vase with Fifteen\nSunflowers](/wiki/Sunflowers_\\(series_of_paintings\\) \"Sunflowers \\(series of\npaintings\\)\")_ by [Vincent van Gogh](/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh \"Vincent van\nGogh\")) is from March 1987; with a price of £24.75 million (£63.9 million in\ncurrent value) it tripled the previous record and introduced a new era in top\nart sales. Before this, the highest absolute price paid for a painting was\n£8.1 million (£18.0 million in current value) paid by the [J. Paul Getty\nMuseum](/wiki/J._Paul_Getty_Museum \"J. Paul Getty Museum\") for\n[Mantegna](/wiki/Andrea_Mantegna \"Andrea Mantegna\")'s _[Adoration of the\nMagi](/wiki/Adoration_of_the_Magi_\\(Mantegna\\) \"Adoration of the Magi\n\\(Mantegna\\)\")_ at [Christie's](/wiki/Christie%27s \"Christie's\") in London on\nApril 18, 1985.[2] In [constant dollars](/wiki/Constant_dollars \"Constant\ndollars\"), the highest price paid before 1987 was by the [National Gallery of\nArt](/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Art \"National Gallery of Art\") when in February\n1967 they acquired [Leonardo da Vinci](/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci \"Leonardo da\nVinci\")'s _[Ginevra de' Benci](/wiki/Ginevra_de%27_Benci \"Ginevra de' Benci\")_\nfor around $5 million ($36 million in current dollars) from the [Princely\nFamily of Liechtenstein](/wiki/Princely_Family_of_Liechtenstein \"Princely\nFamily of Liechtenstein\"). The sale of Van Gogh's _Sunflowers_ was also\nsignificant in that for the first time a \"modern\" (in this case 1888) painting\nbecame the record holder, as opposed to the [old master\npaintings](/wiki/Old_master_painting \"Old master painting\") which previously\nhad dominated the market. In contrast, there are currently only nine pre-1875\npaintings among the listed top 79, and no works painted between 1635 and 1874.\n\nAn exceptional case is graffiti artist [David Choe](/wiki/David_Choe \"David\nChoe\"), who accepted payment in shares for painting graffiti art in the\nheadquarters of a fledgling [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\"). While his\nshares were of limited value when he was awarded them, by the time of\nFacebook's [IPO](/wiki/IPO \"IPO\") they were valued at around $200m.[3]\n\n## Van Gogh, Picasso, and\nWarhol[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_most_expensive_paintings&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Van Gogh, Picasso, and Warhol\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Red_vineyards.jpg/220px-\nRed_vineyards.jpg)](/wiki/File:Red_vineyards.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Red_vineyards.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[The Red Vineyard](/wiki/The_Red_Vineyard \"The Red Vineyard\")_ , the only\npainting [Vincent van Gogh](/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh \"Vincent van Gogh\") sold\nduring his lifetime.\n\n[Vincent van Gogh](/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh \"Vincent van Gogh\"), [Pablo\nPicasso](/wiki/Pablo_Picasso \"Pablo Picasso\"), and [Andy\nWarhol](/wiki/Andy_Warhol \"Andy Warhol\") are by far the best represented\nartists in the list. Whereas Picasso and Warhol became wealthy men, Van Gogh\n(supposedly) sold only one painting in his lifetime, _[The Red\nVineyard](/wiki/The_Red_Vineyard \"The Red Vineyard\")_ , for 400 francs (about\n$2000 in 2017) to the impressionist painter and heiress [Anna\nBoch](/wiki/Anna_Boch \"Anna Boch\").[4] His seven paintings in the list below\nalone were sold for over 730 million current dollars.\n\n## Interactive\ngraph[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_most_expensive_paintings&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Interactive graph\")]\n\n![Sale of the Most Expensive\nPaintings](/api/rest_v1/page/graph/png/List_of_most_expensive_paintings/0/019dd76b5f4887040716e65de53802c5033cb40c.png)\n\nSale of the Most Expensive Paintings\n\n_►_\n\n## List of highest prices\npaid[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_most_expensive_paintings&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: List of highest prices paid\")]\n\nThis list is ordered by [consumer price index](/wiki/Consumer_price_index\n\"Consumer price index\") inflation-adjusted value (**in bold**) in millions of\n[United States dollars](/wiki/United_States_dollar \"United States dollar\") in\nthe current year.[note 1] Where necessary, the price is first converted to\ndollars using the [exchange rate](/wiki/Exchange_rate \"Exchange rate\") at the\ntime the painting was sold.
