There are no recurring cast members or canonical\nreferences to the previous film. _Bring It On Again_ is also the only\n[straight to video](/wiki/Direct-to-video \"Direct-to-video\") sequel of the\nfour that followed _Bring It On_ that shared the same producers. No one else\ninvolved in the original film participated in the creation of this film, nor\nin any of the following. The film does stylistically refer to its predecessor\nduring the end credits, both of which feature outtakes and clips of the cast\nhaving fun dancing and singing.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Cast\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n## Plot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bring_It_On_Again&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nWhittier arrives at the fictional California State College hoping to join the\nnational champion varsity cheerleading team. She meets up with her friend from\ncheerleading camp, Monica, and they're both impressive at the tryouts. Head\ncheerleader Tina is ready to ask them to join the team, but Greg goes a step\nfurther, telling Tina that Whittier will be the next head cheerleader. This\nangers Tina's pal Marni who had the position staked out, but at the urging of\nDean Sebastian, Tina goes along with the plan, taking Whittier under her wing.\nWhittier meets Derek, a campus D.J. who immediately takes an interest in her.\nTina is very demanding and controlling and warns Whittier that Derek is not\nthe type of boy she should be dating. Monica is bothered by Tina's meddling,\nbut Whittier momentarily lets her cheerleading ambition get the better of her,\nand betrays Derek. Then, Tina, upset with Monica's sassy attitude, punishes\nher which leads to an injury and she forces Whittier to choose between her\nfriendship and the squad. Whittier and Monica get fed up and quit Tina's\ntyranny, but Whittier's school spirit cannot be suppressed. With Monica's\nhelp, she gathers up the outcasts from the drama club, the dance club, and\nother groups that have lost their funding because of the squad and forms a\nragtag squad of her own, determined to battle the varsity squad for a spot at\nthe national championship. The two teams end up competing for the spot at\nnationals, with Whittier's squad ultimately winning. Afterward, Whittier\noffers Tina a spot on her squad, a position that Tina initially refuses but\nends up wanting. The film ends with Tina sucking up to Whittier and Monica,\ndeciding she wants to be on their squad after all, while Marni comically\nthrows a fit.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bring_It_On_Again&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Anne Judson-Yager](/wiki/Anne_Judson-Yager \"Anne Judson-Yager\") as Whittier Smith\n  * [Bree Turner](/wiki/Bree_Turner \"Bree Turner\") as Tina Hammersmith\n  * [Kevin Cooney](/wiki/Kevin_Cooney \"Kevin Cooney\") as Dean Sebastian\n  * [Faune A.
