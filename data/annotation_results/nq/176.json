At six years old, Reese began singing in\nchurch. From this experience, she became an avid [gospel](/wiki/Gospel_music\n\"Gospel music\") singer. On weekends in the 1940s, she and her mother would go\nto the movies independently to watch the likes of [Joan\nCrawford](/wiki/Joan_Crawford \"Joan Crawford\"), [Bette\nDavis](/wiki/Bette_Davis \"Bette Davis\"), and [Lena Horne](/wiki/Lena_Horne\n\"Lena Horne\") portray glamorous lives on screen. Afterwards, Reese would act\nout the scenes from the films. In 1944, she began her career directing the\nyoung people's choir, after she had nurtured acting plus her obvious musical\ntalent. She was often chosen, on radio, as a regular singer. At the age of 13,\nshe was hired to sing with [Mahalia Jackson](/wiki/Mahalia_Jackson \"Mahalia\nJackson\")'s gospel group. Delloreese entered Detroit's popular [Cass Technical\nHigh School](/wiki/Cass_Technical_High_School \"Cass Technical High School\")\n(where she attended the same year as Edna Rae Gillooly, later known as [Ellen\nBurstyn](/wiki/Ellen_Burstyn \"Ellen Burstyn\")). She also continued with her\ntouring with Jackson. With higher grades, she was the first in her family to\ngraduate from high school in 1947, at only 15.\n\nAfterwards, she formed her own gospel group, the [Meditation\nSingers](/wiki/Meditation_Singers \"Meditation Singers\"). However, due in part\nto the death of her mother and her father's serious illness, Reese had to\ninterrupt her schooling at [Wayne State\nUniversity](/wiki/Wayne_State_University \"Wayne State University\") to help\nsupport her family. Faithful to the memory of her mother, Delloreese moved out\nof her father's house when she disapproved of him taking up with a new\ngirlfriend. She then took on odd jobs, such as truck driver, dental\nreceptionist, and elevator operator, after 1949. Performing in clubs, Early\nsoon decided to shorten her name from \"Delloreese Early\" to \"Della Reese\".\n\n## Musical career[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Musical career\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Reese remained there for eight weeks. Although her roots were in\n[gospel music](/wiki/Gospel_music \"Gospel music\"), she now was being exposed\nto and influenced by such [jazz](/wiki/Jazz \"Jazz\") artists as [Ella\nFitzgerald](/wiki/Ella_Fitzgerald \"Ella Fitzgerald\"), [Sarah\nVaughan](/wiki/Sarah_Vaughan \"Sarah Vaughan\") and [Billie\nHoliday](/wiki/Billie_Holiday \"Billie Holiday\"). In 1953, she signed a\nrecording contract with [Jubilee Records](/wiki/Jubilee_Records \"Jubilee\nRecords\"), for which she recorded six albums. Later that year, she also joined\nthe [Hawkins](/wiki/Erskine_Hawkins \"Erskine Hawkins\") Orchestra. Her first\nrecordings for Jubilee were songs such as \"[In the Still of the\nNight](/wiki/In_the_Still_of_the_Night_\\(Cole_Porter_song\\) \"In the Still of\nthe Night \\(Cole Porter song\\)\")\" (originally published in 1937), \"[I've Got\nMy Love to Keep Me Warm](/wiki/I%27ve_Got_My_Love_to_Keep_Me_Warm \"I've Got My\nLove to Keep Me Warm\")\" and \"[Time After\nTime](/wiki/Time_After_Time_\\(1947_song\\) \"Time After Time \\(1947 song\\)\")\"\n(1947). The songs were later included on the album _And That Reminds Me_\n(1959).\n\nIn 1957, Reese released a single called \"[And That Reminds\nMe](/wiki/And_That_Reminds_Me \"And That Reminds Me\")\". After years of\nperforming, she gained chart success with this song. It became a Top Twenty\npop hit and a million-seller record. That year, Reese was voted by\n_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_ ,\n_[Cashbox](/wiki/Cashbox_\\(magazine\\) \"Cashbox \\(magazine\\)\")_ and various\nother magazines, as \"The Most Promising Singer\". In 1959, Reese moved to [RCA\nRecords](/wiki/RCA_Records \"RCA Records\") and released her first RCA single,\ncalled \"[Don't You Know?](/wiki/Don%27t_You_Know%3F \"Don't You Know?\"),\" which\nwas adapted from [Giacomo Puccini](/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini \"Giacomo Puccini\")'s\nmusic for _[La bohème](/wiki/La_boh%C3%A8me \"La bohème\"),_ specifically, the\naria \"[Quando m'en vo'](/wiki/Quando_m%27en_vo%27 \"Quando m'en vo'\")\"\n(Musetta's Waltz). It became her biggest hit to date, reaching the number 2\nspot on the pop charts and topping the [R&B](/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues \"Rhythm\nand blues\") charts (then called the \"Hot R&B Sides\") that year. It sold over\none million copies, and was awarded a [gold\ndisc](/wiki/Music_recording_sales_certification \"Music recording sales\ncertification\") by the [RIAA](/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America\n\"Recording Industry Association of America\").[6] Eventually, the song came to\nbe widely considered the [signature song](/wiki/List_of_signature_songs \"List\nof signature songs\") of her early career. She then released a successful\nfollow-up single called \"Not One Minute More\" (number 16). She remained on the\n[_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") chart with\n\"And Now\" (number 69). In 1960 she released \"[Someday (You'll Want Me to Want\nYou)](/wiki/Someday_\\(You%27ll_Want_Me_to_Want_You\\) \"Someday \\(You'll Want Me\nto Want You\\)\")\" (number 56) which was drawn from her Grammy-nominated album\n_[Della](/wiki/Della_\\(album\\) \"Della \\(album\\)\")_. The album rose in the pop\nalbum charts to number 35.\n\nIn November 1960, Reese appeared in advertisements in\n_[Ebony](/wiki/Ebony_\\(magazine\\) \"Ebony \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine for the\nnewly launched AMI Continental [jukebox](/wiki/Jukebox \"Jukebox\"). Reese\nrecorded regularly throughout the 1960s, releasing singles and several albums.\nTwo of the most significant were _[The Classic Della](/wiki/The_Classic_Della\n\"The Classic Della\")_ (1962) and _Waltz with Me, Della_ (1963), which\nbroadened her fan base internationally. She recorded several jazz-focused\nalbums, including _Della Reese Live_ (1966), _On Strings of Blue_ (1967) and\n_One of a Kind_ (1978). She also performed in [Las Vegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas \"Las\nVegas\") for nine years and toured across the country. Reese continued to\nrecord albums in the following decades, receiving two more Grammy nominations\nin the gospel category for the album _Della Reese and Brilliance_ (1991) and\nfor the live recorded album, _My Soul Feels Better Right Now_ (1999).[7]\nMotown singer [Martha Reeves](/wiki/Martha_Reeves \"Martha Reeves\") cites Reese\nas a major influence and says she named her group [The\nVandellas](/wiki/Martha_and_the_Vandellas \"Martha and the Vandellas\") after\nVan Dyke Street in Detroit and Della Reese.\n\n## Television and film\ncareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Television and film career\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Della_Reese_1977.JPG/180px-\nDella_Reese_1977.JPG)](/wiki/File:Della_Reese_1977.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Della_Reese_1977.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nReese appearing in a [Kraft Foods](/wiki/Kraft_Foods \"Kraft Foods\")\ncommercial, 1977.\n\nIn 1969, Reese began a transition into acting work which would eventually lead\nto her highest profile. Her first attempt at television stardom was a talk\nshow series, _Della_ , which was cancelled after 197 episodes (June 9, 1969 –\nMarch 13, 1970).[8] In 1970, Reese became the first black woman to guest host\n_[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny\nCarson](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson \"The Tonight Show\nStarring Johnny Carson\")_. She appeared in several TV movies and miniseries,\nwas a regular on _[Chico and the Man](/wiki/Chico_and_the_Man \"Chico and the\nMan\")_ and played the mother of [B. A.

She wanted to have a one-shot agreement\nbetween [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") and producer [Martha\nWilliamson](/wiki/Martha_Williamson \"Martha Williamson\"), but ordered more\nepisodes. Reese was widely seen as a key component of the show's success.\nAlready starring on _Touched by an Angel_ was the lesser-known\n[Irish](/wiki/Irish_people \"Irish people\") actress [Roma\nDowney](/wiki/Roma_Downey \"Roma Downey\"), who played the role of case worker\nTess's angel/employee, Monica. In numerous interviews, there was an on- and\noff-screen chemistry between both Reese and Downey. The character of Tess was\nthe angelic supervisor who sent the other angels out on missions to help\npeople redeem their lives and show them God's love, while at the same time,\nshe was sassy and had a no-nonsense attitude. The show often featured a\nclimactic monologue delivered by the angel Monica in which she reveals herself\nas an angel to a human with the words: \"I am an angel sent by God to tell you\nthat He loves you.\" The character of Tess was portrayed by Reese as down-to-\nearth, experienced and direct. Reese also sang the show's theme song, \"Walk\nwith You\", and was featured prominently on the soundtrack album produced in\nconjunction with the show.\n\nDuring its first season in 1994, many critics were skeptical about the show,\nit being the second overtly religious prime-time fantasy series, after\n_[Highway to Heaven](/wiki/Highway_to_Heaven \"Highway to Heaven\")._ The show\nhad a rocky start, low ratings and was cancelled 11 episodes into the first\nseason. However, with the help of a massive letter-writing campaign, the show\nwas resuscitated the following season and became a huge ratings winner for the\nnext seven seasons. At the beginning of the fourth season in 1997, Reese\nthreatened to leave the show because she was making less than her co-stars;\nCBS ended up raising her salary. _Touched by an Angel_ was cancelled in 2003,\nbut it continued re-running heavily in syndication and on [Ion\nTelevision](/wiki/Ion_Television \"Ion Television\") (formerly PAX-TV), [The\nHallmark Channel](/wiki/Hallmark_Channel \"Hallmark Channel\"),\n[Up](/wiki/Up_\\(TV_channel\\) \"Up \\(TV channel\\)\"), and later [MeTV](/wiki/MeTV\n\"MeTV\"). Roma Downey said of her on- and off-screen relationship with Reese:\n\n“ | She's very wise. She's very loving. She can be a little gruff at times, but she's always adoring and adorable. I lost my mother when I was very young, and during my whole adolescence and into my twenties, I'd been looking for a mother figure, and I really think I can say with absolute truth and sincerity that I feel that I finally found her in Della Reese. | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \nDowney later also said:\n\n“ | I think I'll just always remember the feel of her neck against my cheek when she hugs me and the love I know that she has for me and the love that I feel for her and the love that she has for God. To know Della is to know that she loves God. | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \n## Personal life[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Personal life\")]\n\nIn 2005, Reese was honored by [Oprah Winfrey](/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey \"Oprah\nWinfrey\") at her Legends Ball ceremony, along with 25 other black\nwomen.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] On July 6, 2011, Reese celebrated her 80th birthday at the Catalina\nJazz Club in [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\").[9] In 2015, a\nGolden Palm Star on the [Palm Springs](/wiki/Palm_Springs,_California \"Palm\nSprings, California\") [Walk of Stars](/wiki/Palm_Springs_Walk_of_Stars \"Palm\nSprings Walk of Stars\") was dedicated to her.[10] Della Reese was the\ngodmother of Roma Downey's daughter Reilly Marie. Reese officiated at[11] the\nmarriage ceremony of [Roma Downey](/wiki/Roma_Downey \"Roma Downey\") and [Mark\nBurnett](/wiki/Mark_Burnett \"Mark Burnett\") in the absence of Downey's late\nmother.\n\n### Family[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Family\")]\n\nReese's mother, Nellie Mitchelle Early, died in 1949 of an [intracerebral\nhemorrhage](/wiki/Intracerebral_hemorrhage \"Intracerebral hemorrhage\").\nReese's father, Richard Early, died ten years later. Reese had an adoptive\ndaughter whom she acquired from a family member unable to care for her, named\nDelorese Daniels Owens, in 1961. Owens died on March 14, 2002. She passed away\nfrom complications stemming from [pituitary disease](/wiki/Pituitary_disease\n\"Pituitary disease\"). Reese said about the painful experience, sharing her\nfrustration with the lack of awareness and knowledge of pituitary disorders:\n\n“ | When it happened, I thought, 'It's such an odd thing to die from,' because pituitary problems aren't something you hear about. It makes it harder because you don't understand what happened. It seemed so strange and hard to explain. It still is, to be honest.[12] | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \n### Marriages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Marriages\")]\n\nIn 1952, Reese married factory worker Vermont Adolphus Bon Taliaferro,\nnineteen years her senior,[13] and adopted the stage name Pat Ferro[14] for a\nweek, before introducing the stage name she used for the rest of her life –\nthough sources differ as to whether this was after the failure of the\nmarriage,[13] or simply a show-business decision.[15] A second marriage\nceremony, on December 28, 1959, to accountant Leroy Basil Gray, who had two\nchildren by a previous marriage, was kept secret for some time.[16] This\nmarriage either ended in divorce[17] or was annulled on the basis that Gray's\nprevious divorce was invalid.[13] Reese appears to have been briefly married\nto [Mercer Ellington](/wiki/Mercer_Ellington \"Mercer Ellington\") (who was then\nher manager) in 1961, before this was annulled later that year due to\nEllington's [Mexican divorce](/wiki/Mexican_divorce \"Mexican divorce\") being\nruled invalid.[13]In 1983, she married Franklin Thomas Lett, Jr., a concert\nproducer and writer.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Health[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Health\")]\n\nIn 1979, after taping a guest spot for _[The Tonight\nShow](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson \"The Tonight Show Starring\nJohnny Carson\"),_ she suffered a near-fatal brain [aneurysm](/wiki/Aneurysm\n\"Aneurysm\"), but made a full recovery after two surgeries by neurosurgeon\n[Charles Drake](/wiki/Charles_George_Drake \"Charles George Drake\") at\n[University Hospital](/wiki/University_Hospital_\\(London,_Ontario\\)\n\"University Hospital \\(London, Ontario\\)\") in [London,\nOntario](/wiki/London,_Ontario \"London, Ontario\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\n2016, shortly after her 85th birthday, Reese was said to be in poor health,\nand had undergone multiple surgeries. She further disclosed that she had\nneglected her health for years, which had contributed to her developing\ndiabetes.[18] After her last appearance on _[Signed, Sealed,\nDelivered](/wiki/Signed,_Sealed,_Delivered_\\(TV_series\\) \"Signed, Sealed,\nDelivered \\(TV series\\)\")_ , she had retired from acting. While Reese\nsometimes used a wheelchair, she avoided using one often, because it would\nmake her condition worse.[19]\n\n### Ministry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Ministry\")]\n\nIn the 1980s, Reese was ordained as a\n[minister](/wiki/Minister_\\(Christianity\\) \"Minister \\(Christianity\\)\")\nthrough the Christian New Thought branch known as Unity, after serving as the\nsenior minister and founder of her own church, Understanding Principles for\nBetter Living.[20] The \"Up Church\" is under Universal Foundation for Better\nLiving, a denomination of Christian New Thought founded by Rev. [Johnnie\nColemon](/wiki/Johnnie_Colemon \"Johnnie Colemon\"), a close friend of Rev.\nReese-Lett. As of\n2009[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit),\nthey meet at First Lutheran Church in [Inglewood,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Inglewood,_California \"Inglewood, California\").[21] In her\nministerial work, she was known as the Rev. Dr. Della Reese Lett.[22]\n\n## Death[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Death\")]\n\nReese died on November 19, 2017, at her Los Angeles, California, home at the\nage of 86. No cause was given, although she had suffered from Type\n2-diabetes.[23].[24] Her representative Lynda Blensky told _[USA\nToday](/wiki/USA_Today \"USA Today\")_ , \"We lost a magnificent woman who was a\ntrailblazer in many ways.\"[25]\n\nLongtime friends [Roma Downey](/wiki/Roma_Downey \"Roma Downey\") (with whom she\nworked on _Touched by an Angel_) and [Jackee Harry](/wiki/Jackee_Harry \"Jackee\nHarry\") (with whom she worked on _227_ and _The Royal Family_) reflected on\nher death. Downey said, \"On behalf of her husband, Franklin Lett, and all her\nfriends and family, I share with you the news that our beloved Della Reese has\npassed away peacefully at her California home last evening surrounded by\nlove,\" She then said: \"She was an incredible wife, mother, grandmother,\nfriend, and pastor, as well as an award-winning actress and singer. Through\nher life and work, she touched and inspired the lives of millions of people.\nShe was a mother to me and I had the privilege of working with her side by\nside for so many years on _Touched by an Angel_. I know heaven has a brand new\nangel this day. Della Reese will be forever in our hearts. Rest In Peace,\nsweet angel. We love you.\"[26]\n\nHarry tweeted, \"I am completely devastated by the loss of Della Reese. She was\na great co-star, sparring partner, drinking buddy, and friend. She taught me\nthe power of prayer and the importance of humility. I'll be forever grateful\nto call her my friend.\"[27]\n\n## Discography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Discography\")]\n\nMain article: [Della Reese discography](/wiki/Della_Reese_discography \"Della\nReese discography\")\n\n## Filmography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Filmography\")]\n\n### Film[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Film\")]\n\nYear | Title | Role | Notes  \n---|---|---|---  \n1975 | _[Psychic Killer](/wiki/Psychic_Killer \"Psychic Killer\")_ | Mrs. Gibson | [28]  \n1989 | _[Harlem Nights](/wiki/Harlem_Nights \"Harlem Nights\")_ | Vera Walker | [28]  \n1996 | _Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate](/wiki/A_Thin_Line_Between_Love_and_Hate \"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate\")_ | Ma Wright | [28]  \n2000 | _[Dinosaur](/wiki/Dinosaur_\\(film\\) \"Dinosaur \\(film\\)\")_ | Eema (voice) | [28]  \n2005 | _[Beauty Shop](/wiki/Beauty_Shop \"Beauty Shop\")_ | Mrs. Towner | [28]  \n2007 | _[If I Had Known I Was a Genius](/wiki/If_I_Had_Known_I_Was_a_Genius \"If I Had Known I Was a Genius\")_ | Nana | [28]  \n2010 | _[Expecting Mary](/wiki/Expecting_Mary \"Expecting Mary\")_ | Doris Dorkus | [29]  \n2012 | _Meant to Be_ | Mave | [30]  \n2012 | _Me Again_ | Muriel | [31]  \n2012 | _Christmas Angel_ | Elsa Way | [28]  \n  \n### Television\nfilms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Television films\")]\n\nYear | Title | Role | Notes  \n---|---|---|---  \n1973 | _Voyage of the Yes_ | Opal Parker | [28]  \n1973 | _Daddy 's Girl_ | Diane | [28]  \n1974 | _Twice in a Lifetime_ | Flo | [28]  \n1975 | _Cop on the Beat_ | Claudine | [32]  \n1976 | _Flo 's Place_ | Flo | [28]  \n1976 | _[Nightmare in Badham County](/wiki/Nightmare_in_Badham_County \"Nightmare in Badham County\")_ | Sarah | [28]  \n1990 | _Kid Who Loved Christmas, The The Kid Who Loved Christmas_ | Alicia Slater | [28]  \n1992 | _You Must Remember This_ | Ella DuChamps | Voice[28]  \n1997 | _Match Made in Heaven, A[A Match Made in Heaven](/wiki/A_Match_Made_in_Heaven \"A Match Made in Heaven\")_ | Katie Beale | [28]  \n1997 | _Miracle in the Woods_ | Lilly Cooper | [28]  \n1998 | _[Emma's Wish](/wiki/Emma%27s_Wish \"Emma's Wish\")_ | Mona Washburn | [28]  \n1998 | _[Mama Flora's Family](/wiki/Mama_Flora%27s_Family \"Mama Flora's Family\")_ | Nana Fleming | [28]  \n1999 | _Secret Path, The The Secret Path_ | Honey | [28]  \n1999 | _Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters First 100 Years_ | Martha Logan | [28]  \n1999 | _[Anya's Bell](/wiki/Anya%27s_Bell \"Anya's Bell\")_ | Anya Herpick | [28]  \n2000 | _Moving of Sophia Myles, The The Moving of Sophia Myles_ | Sophia Myles | [28]  \n2011 | _Hallelujah_ | Dulcie Prejean | [33]  \n2012 | _Christmas Angel_ | Elsie Waybright | [28]  \n2013 | _[Dear Secret Santa](/wiki/Dear_Secret_Santa \"Dear Secret Santa\")_ | Linda | [34]  \n2013 | _Miracle at Gate 213_ | Alma Peddington | [35]  \n  \n### Television\nseries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Della_Reese&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit\nsection: Television series\")]\n\nYear | Title | Role | Notes | Reference  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n1968 | _Mod Squad, The[The Mod Squad](/wiki/The_Mod_Squad \"The Mod Squad\")_ | Paula | Episode: \"Find Tara Chapman!\" | [36]  \n1970 | _Bold Ones: The New Doctors, The[The Bold Ones: The New Doctors](/wiki/The_Bold_Ones:_The_New_Doctors \"The Bold Ones: The New Doctors\")_ | Grace Dayton | Episode: \"Killer on the Loose\" | [37]  \n1974 | _[Police Woman](/wiki/Police_Woman_\\(TV_series\\) \"Police Woman \\(TV series\\)\")_ | Tina Thompson | Episode: \"Requiem for Bored Wives\" | [37]  \n1974–1976 | _[McCloud](/wiki/McCloud_\\(TV_series\\) \"McCloud \\(TV series\\)\")_ | Police Sgt.
