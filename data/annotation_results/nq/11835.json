Though the rebellion did not\nchange the power structure, some historians consider it a\n[catalyst](/wiki/Catalyst \"Catalyst\") to the [American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American Revolutionary War\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Causes of rebellion\n    * 1.1 Population increase and new settlers arrive\n    * 1.2 Economic depression\n    * 1.3 Class war and political corruption\n    * 1.4 Regulators organize and arrival of Governor Tryon\n  * 2 Regulator leadership under Herman Husband\n  * 3 Anti-Regulator forces\n  * 4 Events\n    * 4.1 Breaking up the provincial court\n    * 4.2 Documents\n    * 4.3 War\n  * 5 Aftermath\n  * 6 Regulation in South Carolina\n  * 7 In popular culture\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 Further reading\n  * 11 External links\n\n## Causes of\nrebellion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Causes of rebellion\")]\n\n### Population increase and new settlers\narrive[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Population increase and new settlers arrive\")]\n\nThe origins of the War of Regulation stem from a dramatic population increase\nin [North](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North Carolina\") and [South\nCarolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\") in the 1760s, following\nmigration from the larger eastern cities to the rural west. The inland section\nof the colonies had once been predominantly composed of planters with an\nagricultural economy.\n\nMerchants and lawyers began to move west, upsetting the social and political\nstructure. They were joined by new Scots-Irish immigrants, who populated the\nbackcountry.\n\n### Economic\ndepression[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Economic depression\")]\n\nAt the same time, the local inland agricultural community suffered from a deep\neconomic depression because of severe droughts throughout the previous decade.\nThe loss of crops cost farmers not only their direct food source but also\ntheir primary means of an income, which led many to rely on the goods being\nbrought by newly arrived merchants. As income was cut off, the local planters\noften fell into debt. The merchants, in turn, relied on lawyers and the court\nto settle disputes. Debts were common at the time, but from 1755 to 1765, the\ncases brought to the docket increased nearly sixteen-fold, from seven annually\nto 111 in [Orange County, North Carolina](/wiki/Orange_County,_North_Carolina\n\"Orange County, North Carolina\"), alone.[1]\n\n### Class war and political\ncorruption[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Class war and political corruption\")]\n\nSuch court cases could often lead to planters losing their homes and property\nso they grew to resent the presence of the newcomers. The shift in population\nand politics eventually led to an imbalance within the colony's courthouses,\nand the new and well-educated lawyers used their superior knowledge of the law\nto their sometimes unjust advantage. A small clique of wealthy officials\nformed and became an exclusive inner circle in charge of the legal affairs of\nthe area. The group was seen as a 'courthouse ring', or a small bunch of\nofficials who grabbed most of the political power for themselves.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Regulators organize and arrival of Governor\nTryon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Regulators organize and arrival of Governor Tryon\")]\n\nIn 1764, several thousand people from North Carolina, mainly from\n[Orange](/wiki/Orange_County,_North_Carolina \"Orange County, North Carolina\"),\n[Anson](/wiki/Anson_County,_North_Carolina \"Anson County, North Carolina\"),\nand [Granville](/wiki/Granville_County,_North_Carolina \"Granville County,\nNorth Carolina\") counties in the western region, were extremely dissatisfied\nwith the wealthy North Carolina officials, whom they considered cruel,\narbitrary, tyrannical and corrupt. Local sheriffs collected taxes, as\nsupported by the courts; the sheriffs and courts had sole control over their\nlocal regions. With the arrival of [Royal Governor William\nTryon](/wiki/William_Tryon \"William Tryon\") in 1765, volatile conditions in\nthe [Province of North Carolina](/wiki/Province_of_North_Carolina \"Province of\nNorth Carolina\") increasingly worsened, and a violent uprising would\neventually occur. Many of the officers were very greedy and often would band\ntogether with other local officials for their own personal gain. The entire\nsystem depended on the integrity of local officials, many of whom engaged in\nextortion; taxes collected often enriched the tax collectors directly. At\ntimes, sheriffs would intentionally remove records of their tax collection to\ngo back to residents to ask for more taxes. The system was endorsed by the\ncolonial governor, who feared losing the support of the various county\nofficials.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe effort to eliminate the system of government became known as the Regulator\nuprising, War of the Regulation, or the Regulator War. The most heavily\naffected areas were said to be those of\n[Rowan](/wiki/Rowan_County,_North_Carolina \"Rowan County, North Carolina\"),\nAnson, Orange, Granville, and\n[Cumberland](/wiki/Cumberland_County,_North_Carolina \"Cumberland County, North\nCarolina\") counties. It was a struggle between mostly lower-class citizens,\nwho made up the majority of the backcountry population of North and South\nCarolina, and the wealthy planter elite, who comprised about 5% of the\npopulation but maintained almost total control of the government.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe stated primary aim of the Regulators was to form an honest government and\nreduce taxation. The wealthy businessmen/politicians who ruled North Carolina\nsaw it as a grave threat to their power. Ultimately, they brought in the\nmilitia to crush the rebellion and hanged its leaders. It is estimated that\nout of the 8,000 people living in Orange County at the time, some 6,000 to\n7,000 supported the Regulators.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe War of the Regulation is considered a catalyst to the American\nRevolutionary War, and it was waged against corrupt officials representing\nking and crown. Almost 300 Regulators became part of the Patriot Movement, and\nonly about 30 claimed loyalty to the British Crown.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Regulator leadership under Herman\nHusband[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Regulator leadership under Herman Husband\")]\n\n[Herman Husband](/wiki/Herman_Husband \"Herman Husband\") became one of the\nunofficial leaders of the Regulators. Husband was from\n[Maryland](/wiki/Maryland \"Maryland\"), born into a [Quaker](/wiki/Quaker\n\"Quaker\") family. One of the major flaws in Husband's campaign was he tried to\ninvite good relations with the eastern regions of North Carolina, mostly\nunaffected by the issues with local sheriffs. Husband retained very little\ncontrol over the Regulators, who generally went against his policies of\nwinning over public sentiment and committed acts of minor violence at regular\nintervals.\n\nAnother Regulator leader was James Hunter. He refused to take command of the\nRegulators after Husband's departure before the [Battle of\nAlamance](/wiki/Battle_of_Alamance \"Battle of Alamance\").\n\nCaptain [Benjamin\nMerrill](/w/index.php?title=Benjamin_Merrill&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Benjamin\nMerrill \\(page does not exist\\)\") had about 300 men under his control and\nwould have assumed control over military leadership after James Hunter, but he\nwas unable to serve in the Battle of Alamance.\n\n## Anti-Regulator\nforces[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Anti-Regulator forces\")]\n\nGovernor [Arthur Dobbs](/wiki/Arthur_Dobbs \"Arthur Dobbs\"), who wrote such\npopular works as _Trade and Improvement of H 'elend_ and _Captain Middleton 's\nDefense,_ served as the Royal Governor of North Carolina until his death in\n1765.\n\n[William Tryon](/wiki/William_Tryon \"William Tryon\") succeeded him. Tryon had\nan extremely lavish home built in 1770 in [New\nBern](/wiki/New_Bern,_North_Carolina \"New Bern, North Carolina\") (known as\n[Tryon Palace](/wiki/Tryon_Palace \"Tryon Palace\")). This was resented by the\nRegulators, who were already paying substantial taxes. William (The Regulator)\nButler was quoted as saying, \"We are determined not to pay the Tax for the\nnext three years, for the Edifice or Governor's House, nor will we pay for\nit.\"\n\nGovernor [Josiah Martin](/wiki/Josiah_Martin \"Josiah Martin\") succeeded\nGovernor Tryon, in office, just after the end of the rebellion. His policies\neased the burden, on former Regulators and allowed them to be assimilated back\ninto society. [Edmund Fanning](/wiki/Edmund_Fanning_\\(colonial_administrator\\)\n\"Edmund Fanning \\(colonial administrator\\)\") was the main opposition to the\nRegulators. A graduate of [Yale College](/wiki/Yale_College \"Yale College\"),\nhe was generally regarded by his friends as well disciplined and firm. He held\nmany political offices in Orange County. He was once found guilty of\nembezzling money (along with Francis Nash) but was fined only one cent per\ncharge.\n\n##\nEvents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Events\")]\n\n### Breaking up the provincial\ncourt[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Breaking up the provincial court\")]\n\nNorth Carolina's colonial court met in\n[Hillsborough](/wiki/Hillsborough,_North_Carolina \"Hillsborough, North\nCarolina\"). In 1768, the Regulators entered Hillsborough, broke up the court,\nand dragged those they saw as corrupt officials through the streets.[2] The\nmob attempted to have the judge try the cases that were pending against\nseveral Regulator leaders, including Husband. The presiding judge ([Richard\nHenderson](/wiki/Richard_Henderson_\\(jurist\\) \"Richard Henderson \\(jurist\\)\"))\nquickly adjourned the court until the next morning to avoid being forced to\nmake a ruling in the presence of an angry mob of Regulators, and escaped in\nthe night. The Regulators rioted, destroying public and private property\nalike. Fanning was among the lawyers beaten, found after taking refuge in a\nshop neighboring the courthouse. According to judge Richard Henderson,\nFanning's beating was so severe that \"one of his eyes was almost beaten\nout.\"[1] The courthouse was systematically and symbolically vandalized. Human\nwaste was placed on the judge's seat, and the body of a long deceased slave\nwas placed upon the lawyers' bar. The mob continued to destroy shops and\nproperty in the town, and ultimately brought their destruction to Fanning's\npersonal residence. After destroying all of the furniture and drinking all of\nhis alcohol, they picked apart his entire house. Henderson's barn, along with\nhis stables and home, were burned to the ground.[3] They cracked the church\nbell of the Church of England, but stopped short of looting the church due to\ntheir religious beliefs.[2]\n\n###\nDocuments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Documents\")]\n\nThere were several different publications and petitions circulated to promote\nthe end of taxation and other issues. A number of influential members of the\narea communities signed the [Regulator\nAdvertisement](/w/index.php?title=Regulator_Advertisement&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Regulator Advertisement \\(page does not exist\\)\") and the [Regulator\nPetition](/w/index.php?title=Regulator_Petition&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Regulator Petition \\(page does not exist\\)\"), of which there were several\nversions of each. Each document identified concerns and issues relevant to the\nRegulator Movement. The terms _Regulation_ and _Regulator_ were introduced in\nthe Regulator Advertisement in 1768.[4]\n\n### War[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: War\")]\n\nWhile small acts of violence had been taking place for some time, mainly out\nof resentment, the first organized conflict was in [Mecklenburg\nCounty](/wiki/Mecklenburg_County,_North_Carolina \"Mecklenburg County, North\nCarolina\") in 1765. Settlers in the region, who were there illegally, forced\naway surveyors of the region assigned with designating land. Minor clashes\nfollowed for the next several years in almost every western county, but the\nonly true battle of the war was the [Battle of\nAlamance](/wiki/Battle_of_Alamance \"Battle of Alamance\") on May 16, 1771.\n\nGovernor Tryon and his forces which numbered just over 1,000, with roughly 150\nofficers, arrived at Hillsborough on May 9. At the same time, General [Hugh\nWaddell](/wiki/Hugh_Waddell_\\(general\\) \"Hugh Waddell \\(general\\)\"),\nsupporting the governor, en route with his contingent of 236 men was met by a\nlarge contingent of Regulators. Realizing his force was outnumbered, he fell\nback to [Salisbury](/wiki/Salisbury,_North_Carolina \"Salisbury, North\nCarolina\"). On May 11, having received word of the retreat from a messenger,\nTryon sent the force to support General Waddell. He intentionally chose a path\nthat would lead his forces through Regulator territory. He gave strict orders\nthat nothing was to be looted or damaged. By May 14, his troops had reached\nAlamance and set up a camp. Leaving about 70 men behind to guard the position,\nhe moved the remainder of his force, slightly under 1,000 men, to find the\nRegulators.\n\nAbout 10 miles (16 km) away, a force of approximately 2,000 Regulators (by\nsome accounts, 6,000)[2] without any clear leadership or supplies was gathered\nmainly as a display of force, and not a standing army. The general Regulator\nstrategy was to scare the governor with a show of superior numbers in order to\nforce the governor to give in to their demands. The first clash of the battle\nwas on May 15 when a rogue band of Regulators had captured two of the\ngovernor's militia soldiers. Governor Tryon had informed the Regulators that\nthey were displaying open arms and rebellion and that action was to be taken\nif they did not disperse. The Regulators did not understand the severity of\nthe crisis they were in and ignored the warning. Despite hesitation from his\nown forces, Governor Tryon allegedly initiated the main battle of Alamance on\nMay 16 by shooting Robert Thompson, who was the first death of the battle. The\nRegulators resistance crumbled somewhat quickly. The battle was over with nine\ndeaths for the governor's forces and about the same for the Regulators.\nVirtually everyone captured in the battle was fully pardoned in exchange for\nan allegiance to the crown; however, six Regulators were hanged for their part\nin the uprising, including 4 officers of the colonial militia who had joined\nranks with the Regulator's side. Those officers were Captain Robert Messer,\nCaptain Benjamin Merrill, Captain James Pugh,and Captain Robert Matear.\n\n##\nAftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\nFollowing the battle, Tryon's militia army traveled through Regulator\nterritory, where he had Regulators and Regulator sympathizers sign loyalty\noaths and destroyed the properties of the most active Regulators. He also\nraised taxes to pay for his militia's defeat of the Regulators.[2]\n\nAt the time of their defeat at the battle of Alamance, public opinion was\ndecidedly against them. They were seen as a bunch of \"lawless desperadoes\" and\nGovernor Tryon was praised for his actions in stamping out the rebellion.[5]\nAs news articles spread the word of his victory, Tryon was branded a hero of\nthe colonies for defeating the larger group of Regulators with his small, well\nprepared militia. However as the initial excitement over the glorious battle\ndied down, many newsmen, especially in the [Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\")\narea, began to question the reasons behind the rebellion and investigated\nfurther to find its cause. Several reasons were found to see the destruction\nof the Regulators as an act of an oppressive government. Most particularly\nadmonished was the methods in which Tryon himself had used to win the battle\nof Alamance. The use of a [riot act](/wiki/Riot_act \"Riot act\"), and the\nexecution of rebellion leaders after the battle was frowned upon. Reports also\nindicated that severe battlefield misconduct had taken place on the governor's\nside, including giving the farmers a two-hour warning period before the battle\nbegan, and subsequently breaking that agreement to bombard them with artillery\nfire.[5]\n\nSeveral trials were held after the war, resulting in the hanging of six\nRegulators at Hillsborough on June 19, 1771. Many of the main leaders remained\nin hiding until 1772, when they were no longer considered outlaws.\n\nMany Regulators moved further west into places such as\n[Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee \"Tennessee\"), notably establishing both the\n[Watauga Association](/wiki/Watauga_Association \"Watauga Association\") at\n[Sycamore Shoals](/wiki/Sycamore_Shoals \"Sycamore Shoals\") (1772) in present\nday [Elizabethton, Tennessee](/wiki/Elizabethton,_Tennessee \"Elizabethton,\nTennessee\"), the first independent white republic on American soil, and the\n[State of Franklin](/wiki/State_of_Franklin \"State of Franklin\") (1784),\nanother short-lived republic that failed to join the Union of the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\").\n\n## Regulation in South\nCarolina[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Regulation in South Carolina\")]\n\nAt the same time as the regulation in North Carolina, the South Carolina\ncolony had a group of men calling themselves regulators, albeit with very\ndifferent goals. The regulators of the south were also farming class,\nlandowning men who had grievances against officialdom. However their main\nproblems stemmed not from corruption, but a lack of representation and of\ngovernment-provided services such as courts and churches. These regulators\nfound an enemy in local groups of \"hunters\" (who were seen as undesirables)\nand bandits. The South Carolina regulation helped catalyze the Revolutionary\nWar, as the residents found the distant authority of the [Parliament of Great\nBritain](/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain \"Parliament of Great Britain\") to\nbe so late in responding to their demands.\n\nThe Regulators of South Carolina were formed during the mid-1760s, and active\nmainly between 1767 and 1769. Over the past few decades the population of the\nfrontier had boomed, thanks to the planning of [Robert\nJohnson](/wiki/Robert_Johnson_\\(governor\\) \"Robert Johnson \\(governor\\)\"). He\nsupported sending yeomen out to the frontier in mass, to provide a buffer for\nthe coastal cities from [Cherokee](/wiki/Cherokee \"Cherokee\") attacks. The\nslave population grew 19% as planters began to develop larger properties for\nagriculture. (But, the slave population of the frontier accounted only for 8%\nof the total population of the colony).\n\nDuring this time, the inland settlers on the South Carolina frontier suffered\nmore from violent crimes, including organized bandit raids. The disruption of\nthe [Cherokee war of 1760-1761](/wiki/Anglo-Cherokee_War \"Anglo-Cherokee War\")\nleft many settlers without homes, and native raids sometimes resulted in\nabandonment of settler children. To sustain their families, the men went out\nhunting. In the colonial period on the western frontier this was not seen as\nan honorable profession, and hunters were labeled as vagrants, bandits, and\noutlaws, and blamed for stealing livestock. Their method of \"fire hunting\" at\nnight used fire to blind deer, and sometimes they mistook farmers' livestock\nfor wild game. They left unused animal corpses, which drew wolves and\nscavengers closer to populated areas. Hunting also pushed well into the\nboundary of the local natives, the [Creek Indians](/wiki/Creek_Indians \"Creek\nIndians\"), exacerbating their already tense relationship with colonists. The\nbandits gathered until they numbered about 200. Eventually they were bold\nenough to attack magistrates. They dragged James Mayson, a regulator, from his\nhome in the night. Originally made up of the hunting groups, the bandits also\naccepted free mulattos and blacks, fugitive slaves, and any outlaw available.\nSome members of the bandit network were well-established farmers.[6]\n\nIn South Carolina, \"regulators\" were not rebels, but a\n[vigilante](/wiki/Vigilante \"Vigilante\") force of propertied elite men. They\nco-operated with their colonial government for their entire active time. The\nSouth Carolina regulators were a much smaller organization than the mass\nmovement in North Carolina. There were 100 known regulators, of whom 32 became\njustices of the peace, and 21 were militia leaders. Thirty-one owned slaves,\nand 14 owned 10 or more. Their primary aim was to protect themselves and their\nassets from bandits, their secondary purpose was to get courts, churches and\nschools established in their quickly growing communities. The only court in\nthe colony was in Charleston, through which all legal documentation had to go.\nThe inland settlers had the sympathy of the coastal elite, but the circuit\ncourt act, which would establish the jails, courts, sheriffs and 14 judicial\ndistricts, was held up by a dispute with the [Parliament of Great\nBritain](/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain \"Parliament of Great Britain\")\nconcerning the tenure of judges.\n\nIn contrast to Herman Husband's Sandy Creek association and regulators, the\nSouth Carolina regulation movement was a great success. Their manifesto,\nwritten by Anglican missionary Rev. [Charles\nWoodmason](/wiki/Charles_Woodmason \"Charles Woodmason\") forcefully argued\ntheir case.[7] Eventually the colonial legislature passed a series of acts\nthat met the needs of the propertied frontiersman. These included vagrancy\nacts, which restricted the hunters, forbidding them to trespass on Native\nlands.\n\nCoupled with the 1769 ordinance for the preservation of deer, which forbade\nfire hunting, the new law resulted in many hunters being whipped and banished\nfrom the area. In 1768 the Charleston grand jury began urging the creations of\nnew schools in the back country, as per regulator request. In 1769 the circuit\ncourt act was passed, making way for the new courthouses and jails, as well as\nsetting up four new judicial districts. The cooperation between frontier and\ncoastal colonists was so effective, that by 1771 Governor Montague of South\nCarolina had issued a full pardon for any actions taken by the regulators in\nhis state.[8]\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: In popular culture\")]\n\n  * The Regulators are featured as important characters in [Jimmy Carter](/wiki/Jimmy_Carter \"Jimmy Carter\")'s [historical novel](/wiki/Historical_novel \"Historical novel\") _[The Hornet's Nest](/wiki/The_Hornet%27s_Nest:_A_Novel_of_the_Revolutionary_War \"The Hornet's Nest: A Novel of the Revolutionary War\")_ (2003).\n  * [Diana Gabaldon](/wiki/Diana_Gabaldon \"Diana Gabaldon\") features The Battle of Alamance as a significant event in her historical time-travel novel [_The Fiery Cross_](/wiki/The_Fiery_Cross_\\(novel\\) \"The Fiery Cross \\(novel\\)\"), the fifth book in the _Outlander_ series.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Alamance Battleground](/wiki/Alamance_Battleground \"Alamance Battleground\")\n  * [Carter County, Tennessee](/wiki/Carter_County,_Tennessee \"Carter County, Tennessee\")\n  * [Doe River](/wiki/Doe_River \"Doe River\")\n  * [Holston River](/wiki/Holston_River \"Holston River\")\n  * [Kings Mountain National Military Park](/wiki/Kings_Mountain_National_Military_Park \"Kings Mountain National Military Park\")\n  * [Kings Mountain, North Carolina](/wiki/Kings_Mountain,_North_Carolina \"Kings Mountain, North Carolina\")\n  * [Roan Mountain (Roan Highlands)](/wiki/Roan_Mountain_\\(Roan_Highlands\\) \"Roan Mountain \\(Roan Highlands\\)\")\n\n|  | \n\n  * [Roan Mountain State Park](/wiki/Roan_Mountain_State_Park \"Roan Mountain State Park\")\n  * [Roan Mountain, Tennessee](/wiki/Roan_Mountain,_Tennessee \"Roan Mountain, Tennessee\")\n  * [Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail](/wiki/Overmountain_Victory_National_Historic_Trail \"Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail\")\n  * [Overmountain Men](/wiki/Overmountain_Men \"Overmountain Men\")\n  * [Isaac Shelby](/wiki/Isaac_Shelby \"Isaac Shelby\")\n  * [Watauga River](/wiki/Watauga_River \"Watauga River\")\n  * [Gideon Gibson Jr.](/wiki/Gideon_Gibson_Jr. \"Gideon Gibson Jr.\")\n  * [Harpe Brothers](/wiki/Harpe_Brothers \"Harpe Brothers\")\n\n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_of_the_Regulation&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Whittenburg, James (1977). _Planters, merchants, and lawyers: Social change and the origins of the North Carolina regulation_. _[The William and Mary Quarterly](/wiki/William_and_Mary_Quarterly \"William and Mary Quarterly\")_. pp. 215–238.
