For the Canadian band named after\nthe geological formation, see [Marianas Trench\n(band)](/wiki/Marianas_Trench_\\(band\\) \"Marianas Trench \\(band\\)\").\n\n[Coordinates](/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system \"Geographic coordinate\nsystem\"): [11°21′N 142°12′E﻿ / ﻿11.350°N 142.200°E﻿ / 11.350;\n142.200](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Mariana_Trench&params=11_21_N_142_12_E_)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Marianatrenchmap.png/290px-\nMarianatrenchmap.png)](/wiki/File:Marianatrenchmap.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Marianatrenchmap.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nLocation of the Mariana Trench\n\nThe **Mariana Trench** or **Marianas Trench**[1] is the\n[deepest](/wiki/Deep_sea \"Deep sea\") part of the world's [oceans](/wiki/Ocean\n\"Ocean\"). It is located in the western [Pacific Ocean](/wiki/Pacific_Ocean\n\"Pacific Ocean\"), an average of 200 kilometres (124 mi) to the east of the\n[Mariana Islands](/wiki/Mariana_Islands \"Mariana Islands\"), in the Western\nPacific east of [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines \"Philippines\"). It is a\ncrescent-shaped scar in the Earth's crust, and measures about 2,550 km (1,580\nmi) long and 69 km (43 mi) wide on average. It reaches a maximum-known depth\nof 10,994 metres (36,070 ft) (± 40 metres [130 ft]) at a small slot-shaped\nvalley in its floor known as the [Challenger Deep](/wiki/Challenger_Deep\n\"Challenger Deep\"), at its southern end,[2] although some unrepeated\nmeasurements place the deepest portion at 11,034 metres (36,201 ft).[3] For\ncomparison: if [Mount Everest](/wiki/Mount_Everest \"Mount Everest\") were\ndropped into the trench at this point, its peak would still be over 2\nkilometres (1.2 mi) underwater.[a] In 2009, the Marianas Trench was\nestablished as a United States National Monument.[5]\n\nAt the bottom of the trench the [water column](/wiki/Water_column \"Water\ncolumn\") above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bars (15,750 psi), more than 1,000\ntimes the [standard atmospheric pressure](/wiki/Standard_atmospheric_pressure\n\"Standard atmospheric pressure\") at sea level. At this pressure, the density\nof water is increased by 4.96%, so that 95.27 litres of water under the\npressure of the Challenger Deep would contain the same mass as 100 litres at\nthe surface. The temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4 °C (34 to 39 °F).[6]\n\nThe trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the [center of the\nEarth](/wiki/Earth%27s_center \"Earth's center\"). This is because the Earth is\nnot a perfect [sphere](/wiki/Sphere \"Sphere\"); its radius is about 25\nkilometres (16 mi) less at the poles than at the equator.[7] As a result,\nparts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) closer to\nthe Earth's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor.\n\n[Xenophyophores](/wiki/Xenophyophore \"Xenophyophore\") have been found in the\ntrench by [Scripps Institution of\nOceanography](/wiki/Scripps_Institution_of_Oceanography \"Scripps Institution\nof Oceanography\") researchers at a record depth of 10.6 kilometres (6.6 mi)\nbelow the sea surface.[8] On 17 March 2013, researchers from the [Scottish\nAssociation for Marine Science](/wiki/Scottish_Association_for_Marine_Science\n\"Scottish Association for Marine Science\") reported data that suggested\n[microbial life forms](/wiki/Microbes \"Microbes\") thrive within the\ntrench.[9][10]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Names\n  * 2 Geology\n  * 3 Measurements\n    * 3.1 Descents\n    * 3.2 Planned descents\n  * 4 Life\n    * 4.1 Pollution\n  * 5 Possible nuclear waste disposal site\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 Notes\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Names[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mariana_Trench&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Names\")]\n\nThe Mariana Trench is named for the nearby [Mariana\nIslands](/wiki/Mariana_Islands \"Mariana Islands\") (in turn named Las Marianas\nin honor of Spanish Queen [Mariana of Austria](/wiki/Mariana_of_Austria\n\"Mariana of Austria\"), widow of [Philip IV of Spain](/wiki/Philip_IV_of_Spain\n\"Philip IV of Spain\")). The islands are part of the [island\narc](/wiki/Island_arc \"Island arc\") that is formed on an over-riding plate,\ncalled the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of\nthe trench.\n\n## Geology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mariana_Trench&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Geology\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Cross_section_of_mariana_trench.svg/350px-\nCross_section_of_mariana_trench.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Cross_section_of_mariana_trench.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cross_section_of_mariana_trench.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Pacific plate is subducted beneath the Mariana Plate, creating the Mariana\ntrench, and (further on) the arc of the Mariana islands, as water trapped in\nthe plate is released and explodes upward to form island volcanoes and\nearthquakes .\n\nThe Mariana Trench is part of the [Izu-Bonin-Mariana](/wiki/Izu-Bonin-\nMariana_Arc \"Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc\") [subduction](/wiki/Subduction\n\"Subduction\") system that forms the [boundary](/wiki/Convergent_boundary\n\"Convergent boundary\") between two [tectonic plates](/wiki/Tectonic_plate\n\"Tectonic plate\"). In this system, the western edge of one plate, the [Pacific\nPlate](/wiki/Pacific_Plate \"Pacific Plate\"), is [subducted](/wiki/Subduction\n\"Subduction\") (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller [Mariana\nPlate](/wiki/Mariana_Plate \"Mariana Plate\") that lies to the west. Crustal\nmaterial at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest\noceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is therefore cooler\nand more dense; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-\nriding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is\nthe Mariana Trench proper.\n\nThe movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible\nfor the formation of the [Mariana Islands](/wiki/Mariana_Islands \"Mariana\nIslands\"). These volcanic islands are caused by [Flux\nmelting](/wiki/Flux_melting \"Flux melting\") of the upper mantle due to release\nof water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific\nPlate.\n\n## Measurements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mariana_Trench&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Measurements\")]\n\nSee also: [Challenger Deep](/wiki/Challenger_Deep \"Challenger Deep\")\n\nThe trench was first [sounded](/wiki/Depth_sounding \"Depth sounding\") during\nthe [_Challenger_ expedition](/wiki/Challenger_expedition \"Challenger\nexpedition\") in 1875, using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of 4,475\n[fathoms](/wiki/Fathom \"Fathom\") (8,184 metres; 26,850 feet).[11] In 1877, a\nmap was published called _Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans_ (\"Deep map of the\nGreat Ocean\") by Petermann, which showed a _Challenger Tief_ (\"Challenger\ndeep\") at the location of that sounding. In 1899, [USS\nNero](/wiki/USS_Nero_\\(AC-17\\) \"USS Nero \\(AC-17\\)\"), a converted collier,\nrecorded a depth of 5,269 fathoms (9,636 metres; 31,614 feet).[12]\n\nIn 1951, _[Challenger II](/wiki/HMS_Challenger_\\(1931\\) \"HMS Challenger\n\\(1931\\)\")_ surveyed the trench using [echo sounding](/wiki/Echo_sounding\n\"Echo sounding\"), a much more precise and vastly easier way to measure depth\nthan the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition.\nDuring this survey, the deepest part of the trench was recorded when the\n_Challenger II_ measured a depth of 5,960 fathoms (10,900 metres; 35,760 feet)\nat [11°19′N 142°15′E﻿ / ﻿11.317°N 142.250°E﻿ / 11.317;\n142.250](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Mariana_Trench&params=11_19_N_142_15_E_),\nknown as the [Challenger Deep](/wiki/Challenger_Deep \"Challenger Deep\").[13]\n\nIn 1957, the [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") vessel\n[_Vityaz_](/wiki/RV_Vityaz_\\(1939\\) \"RV Vityaz \\(1939\\)\") reported a depth of\n11,034 metres (36,201 ft) at a location dubbed the _Mariana Hollow_.[3]\n\nIn 1962, the surface ship M.V. _Spencer F. Baird_ recorded a maximum depth of\n10,915 metres (35,810 ft) using precision depth gauges.\n\nIn 1984, the Japanese survey vessel _Takuyō_ (拓洋) collected data from the\nMariana Trench using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounder; it reported a maximum\ndepth of 10,924 metres (35,840 ft), also reported as 10,920 metres (35,830 ft)\n±10 m (33 ft).[14] Remotely Operated Vehicle _[KAIKO](/wiki/Kaik%C5%8D\n\"Kaikō\")_ reached the deepest area of the Mariana Trench and made the deepest\ndiving record of 10,911 metres (35,797 ft) on March 24, 1995.[15]\n\nDuring surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001, a spot was found along the\nMariana Trench that had depth similar to that of the Challenger Deep, possibly\neven deeper. It was discovered while scientists from the [Hawaii Institute of\nGeophysics and Planetology](/wiki/University_of_Hawaii \"University of Hawaii\")\nwere completing a survey around [Guam](/wiki/Guam \"Guam\"); they used a sonar\nmapping system towed behind the research ship to conduct the survey. This new\nspot was named the [HMRG (Hawaii Mapping Research Group) Deep](/wiki/HMRG_Deep\n\"HMRG Deep\"), after the group of scientists who discovered it.[16]\n\nOn 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 sonar\nmultibeam bathymetry system for deep water, mapping aboard the _[RV Kilo\nMoana](/wiki/RV_Kilo_Moana \"RV Kilo Moana\")_ (mothership of the Nereus\nvehicle), indicated a spot with a depth of 10,971 metres (35,994 ft). The\nsonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of\nbetter than 0.2% of water depth across the entire swath (implying that the\ndepth figure is accurate to ± 22 metres (72 ft)).[17][18]\n\nIn 2011, it was announced at the [American Geophysical\nUnion](/wiki/American_Geophysical_Union \"American Geophysical Union\") Fall\nMeeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a [multibeam\nechosounder](/wiki/Multibeam_echosounder \"Multibeam echosounder\") conducted a\nsurvey which mapped the entire trench to 100 metres (330 ft) resolution.[2]\nThe mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former\n[seamounts](/wiki/Seamount \"Seamount\").[19]\n\nThe Mariana Trench is a site chosen by researchers at [Washington\nUniversity](/wiki/Washington_University \"Washington University\") and the\n[Woods Hole Oceanographic\nInstitution](/wiki/Woods_Hole_Oceanographic_Institution \"Woods Hole\nOceanographic Institution\") in 2012 for a seismic survey to investigate the\nsubsurface [water cycle](/wiki/Water_cycle \"Water cycle\"). Using both [ocean-\nbottom seismometers](/wiki/Ocean-bottom_seismometer \"Ocean-bottom\nseismometer\") and [hydrophones](/wiki/Hydrophone \"Hydrophone\") the scientists\nare able to map structures as deep as 97 kilometres (60 mi) beneath the\nsurface.[20]\n\n### Descents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mariana_Trench&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Descents\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Bathyscaphe_Trieste.jpg/220px-\nBathyscaphe_Trieste.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bathyscaphe_Trieste.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bathyscaphe_Trieste.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [bathyscaphe](/wiki/Bathyscaphe \"Bathyscaphe\")\n_[Trieste](/wiki/Bathyscaphe_Trieste \"Bathyscaphe Trieste\")_ (designed by\n[Auguste Piccard](/wiki/Auguste_Piccard \"Auguste Piccard\")), the first manned\nvehicle to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench.[21]\n\nFour descents have been achieved. The first was the manned descent by Swiss-\ndesigned, Italian-built, [United States Navy](/wiki/United_States_Navy \"United\nStates Navy\")-owned [bathyscaphe](/wiki/Bathyscaphe \"Bathyscaphe\")\n_[Trieste](/wiki/Bathyscaphe_Trieste \"Bathyscaphe Trieste\")_ which reached the\nbottom at 1:06 pm on 23 January 1960, with [Don Walsh](/wiki/Don_Walsh \"Don\nWalsh\") and [Jacques Piccard](/wiki/Jacques_Piccard \"Jacques Piccard\") on\nboard.[13][22] Iron shot was used for [ballast](/wiki/Sailing_ballast \"Sailing\nballast\"), with gasoline for [buoyancy](/wiki/Buoyancy \"Buoyancy\").[13] The\nonboard systems indicated a depth of 11,521 m (37,799 ft), but this was later\nrevised to 10,916 m (35,814 ft).[23] The depth was estimated from a conversion\nof [pressure](/wiki/Pressure \"Pressure\") measured and calculations based on\nthe [water density](/wiki/Density_of_saltwater \"Density of saltwater\") from\nsea surface to seabed.[22]\n\nThis was followed by the unmanned\n[ROVs](/wiki/Remotely_operated_underwater_vehicle \"Remotely operated\nunderwater vehicle\") _[Kaikō](/wiki/Kaik%C5%8D \"Kaikō\")_ in 1996 and\n[_Nereus_](/wiki/Nereus_\\(underwater_vehicle\\) \"Nereus \\(underwater\nvehicle\\)\") in 2009. The first three expeditions directly measured very\nsimilar depths of 10,902 to 10,916 m (35,768 to 35,814 ft). The fourth was\nmade by Canadian film director [James Cameron](/wiki/James_Cameron \"James\nCameron\") in 2012. On 26 March, he reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in\nthe submersible vessel _[Deepsea Challenger](/wiki/Deepsea_Challenger \"Deepsea\nChallenger\")_.[24][25][26]\n\nIn July 2015, members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,\nOregon State University, and the Coast Guard submerged a hydrophone into the\ndeepest part of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger Deep, never having deployed\none past a mile. The titanium-shelled hydrophone was designed to withstand the\nimmense pressure 7 miles under.[27] Although researchers were unable to\nretrieve the hydrophone until November, the data capacity was full within the\nfirst 23 days. After months of analyzing the sounds, the experts were\nsurprised to pick up natural _and_ man-made sounds such as boats, earthquakes,\na typhoon, and baleen whales.[28] Due to the mission's success, the\nresearchers announced plans to deploy a second hydrophone in 2017 for an\nextended period of time.\n\n### Planned\ndescents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mariana_Trench&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Planned descents\")]\n\n![Ambox current\nred.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Ambox_current_red.svg/42px-\nAmbox_current_red.svg.png)| This section needs to be **updated**.

Triton Submarines, a Florida-based company that designs\nand manufactures private submarines, plans for a crew of three to take 120\nminutes to reach the seabed.[29] [DOER Marine](/wiki/DOER_Marine \"DOER\nMarine\"), a marine technology company based near [San\nFrancisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\") and set up in 1992, plans for\na crew of two or three to take 90 minutes to reach the seabed.[30]\n\n## Life[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mariana_Trench&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Life\")]\n\nThe expedition conducted in 1960 claimed to have observed, with great surprise\nbecause of the high pressure, large creatures living at the bottom, such as a\n[flatfish](/wiki/Flatfish \"Flatfish\") about 30 cm (12 in) long,[23] and\n[shrimp](/wiki/Shrimp \"Shrimp\").[31] According to Piccard, \"The bottom\nappeared light and clear, a waste of firm [diatomaceous](/wiki/Diatom\n\"Diatom\") ooze\".[23] Many marine biologists are now skeptical of the supposed\nsighting of the flatfish, and it is suggested that the creature may instead\nhave been a [sea cucumber](/wiki/Sea_cucumber \"Sea cucumber\").[32][33] During\nthe second expedition, the unmanned vehicle Kaikō collected mud samples from\nthe [seabed](/wiki/Seabed \"Seabed\").[34] Tiny organisms were found to be\nliving in those samples.\n\nIn July 2011, a research expedition deployed untethered landers, called\ndropcams, equipped with digital video and lights to explore this region of the\ndeep sea. Amongst many other living organisms, some gigantic single-celled\namoebas with a size of more than 10 cm (4 in), belonging to the class of\n[xenophyophores](/wiki/Xenophyophore \"Xenophyophore\") were observed.[35]\nXenophyophores are noteworthy for their size, their extreme abundance on the\nseafloor and their role as hosts for a variety of organisms.\n\nIn December 2014, a new species of [snailfish](/wiki/Snailfish \"Snailfish\")\nwas discovered at a depth of 8,145 m (26,722 ft), breaking the previous record\nfor the deepest living fish seen on video.[36]\n\nDuring the 2014 expedition, several new species were filmed including huge\n[crustaceans](/wiki/Crustaceans \"Crustaceans\") known as supergiants. [Deep-sea\ngigantism](/wiki/Deep-sea_gigantism \"Deep-sea gigantism\") is the process where\nspecies grow larger than their shallow water relatives.[36]\n\nIn May 2017 an unidentified type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of 8,178\nmetres (26,800 ft).[37]\n\n### Pollution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mariana_Trench&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Pollution\")]\n\nIn 2016, a research expedition looked at the chemical makeup of crustacean\nscavengers collected from a range of 7,841–10,250 metres within the trench.\nWithin these organisms, the researchers found extremely elevated\nconcentrations of [PCBs](/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl \"Polychlorinated\nbiphenyl\"), a chemical toxin banned for its environmental harm in the 1970s,\nconcentrated at all depths within the sediment of the trench.[38]\n\n## Possible nuclear waste disposal\nsite[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mariana_Trench&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Possible nuclear waste disposal site\")]\n\nLike other oceanic trenches, the Mariana Trench has been proposed as a site\nfor [nuclear waste](/wiki/Radioactive_waste \"Radioactive waste\")\ndisposal,[39][40] in the hope that tectonic plate\n[subduction](/wiki/Subduction \"Subduction\") occurring at the site might\neventually push the nuclear waste deep into the [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\")'s\n[mantle](/wiki/Mantle_\\(geology\\) \"Mantle \\(geology\\)\"), the second layer of\nthe [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\"). However, ocean dumping of nuclear waste is\nprohibited by international law.[39][40][41] Furthermore, plate subduction\nzones are associated with very large [megathrust\nearthquakes](/wiki/Megathrust_earthquake \"Megathrust earthquake\"), the effects\nof which are unpredictable for the safety of long-term disposal of nuclear\nwastes within the [hadopelagic](/wiki/Hadopelagic \"Hadopelagic\")\n[ecosystem](/wiki/Ecosystem \"Ecosystem\").[40]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mariana_Trench&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/%E5%A4%A7%E6%B4%8B.png/32px-%E5%A4%A7%E6%B4%8B.png)](/wiki/File:%E5%A4%A7%E6%B4%8B.png)[Oceania portal](/wiki/Portal:Oceania \"Portal:Oceania\")\n\n  * [Marianas Trench Marine National Monument](/wiki/Marianas_Trench_Marine_National_Monument \"Marianas Trench Marine National Monument\"), United States national monument at the trench.
