**Referendum on the European Community (Common Market)** , the **Common\nMarket referendum** and **EEC membership referendum** took place on 5 June\n1975 in the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") to gauge\nsupport for the country's continued membership of the [European\nCommunities](/wiki/European_Communities \"European Communities\") (EC)—often\nknown at the time as the \"European Community” and the \"Common Market\" which it\nhad entered on [1 January\n1973](/wiki/Accession_of_the_United_Kingdom_to_the_European_Communities\n\"Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities\") under the\n[Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Conservative Party \\(UK\\)\")\ngovernment of [Edward Heath](/wiki/Edward_Heath \"Edward Heath\") under the\nprovisions of the [Referendum Act 1975](/wiki/Referendum_Act_1975 \"Referendum\nAct 1975\"). [Labour](/wiki/Labour_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Labour Party \\(UK\\)\")'s\n[manifesto](/wiki/Manifesto \"Manifesto\") for the [October 1974 general\nelection](/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_October_1974 \"United Kingdom\ngeneral election, October 1974\") had promised that the people would decide\n\"through the ballot box\"[1] whether to remain in the EC.\n\nThis was the first national referendum ever to be held throughout the entire\nUnited Kingdom, and was the only national UK-wide referendum held in the 20th\nCentury and remained the only UK-wide referendum until the [2011 referendum on\nalternative voting](/wiki/United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum,_2011\n\"United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011\") was held thirty-six years\nlater and was the only referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with\nEurope until the [2016 referendum on continued EU\nmembership](/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016\n\"United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016\").\n\nThe electorate expressed significant support for EC membership, with 67% in\nfavour on a national turnout of 64%. The referendum result was not legally\nbinding, however, it was widely accepted that the vote would be the final say\non the matter and would be politically binding on all future Westminster\nParliaments. In a 1975 pamphlet, the then Prime Minister [Harold\nWilson](/wiki/Harold_Wilson \"Harold Wilson\") said: \"[. . .] I ask you to use\nyour vote. For it is _your_ vote that will now decide. The Government will\naccept _your_ verdict.\"[2] The pamphlet also said: \"Now the time has come for\n_you_ to decide. The Government will accept your decision - whichever way it\ngoes.\"\n\nThe [February 1974 general\nelection](/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974 \"United Kingdom\ngeneral election, February 1974\") had yielded a Labour [minority\ngovernment](/wiki/Minority_government \"Minority government\"), which then won a\nmajority in the October 1974 general election. Labour pledged in its February\n1974 manifesto to renegotiate the terms of British accession to the EC, and\nthen to consult the public on whether Britain should stay in the EC on the new\nterms, if they were acceptable to the government. The Labour Party had\nhistorically feared the consequences of EC membership, such as the large\ndifferentials between the high price of food under the [Common Agricultural\nPolicy](/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy \"Common Agricultural Policy\") and the\nlow prices prevalent in [Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations\n\"Commonwealth of Nations\") markets, as well as the loss of both economic\nsovereignty and the freedom of governments to engage in socialist industrial\npolicies, and party leaders stated their opinion that the Conservatives had\nnegotiated unfavourable terms for Britain.[3] The EC heads of government\nagreed to a deal in [Dublin](/wiki/Dublin \"Dublin\") on 11 March 1975; Wilson\ndeclared \"I believe that our renegotiation objectives have been substantially\nthough not completely achieved\", and said that the government would recommend\na vote in favour of continued membership.[4] On 9 April the [House of\nCommons](/wiki/British_House_of_Commons \"British House of Commons\") voted by\n396 to 170 to continue within the Common Market on the new terms. Along with\nthese developments, the government drafted a Referendum Bill, to be moved in\ncase of a successful renegotiation.\n\nThe referendum debate and campaign was an unusual time in British politics and\nwas the third national vote to be held in seventeen months. During the\ncampaign, the Labour [Cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Cabinet of\nthe United Kingdom\") was split and its members campaigned on each side of the\nquestion, an unprecedented breach of [Cabinet collective\nresponsibility](/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility \"Cabinet collective\nresponsibility\"). Most votes in the House of Commons in preparation for the\nreferendum were only carried thanks to opposition support, and the Government\nfaced several defeats on technical issues such as the handling and format of\nthe referendum counts.

The UK was still absent when\nthe [Treaty of Rome](/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome \"Treaty of Rome\") was signed in\n1957, creating the [European Economic\nCommunity](/wiki/European_Economic_Community \"European Economic Community\")\n(the Common Market). However, in the late 1950s the Conservative government of\n[Harold Macmillan](/wiki/Harold_Macmillan \"Harold Macmillan\") dramatically\nchanged its attitude and appointed [Edward Heath](/wiki/Edward_Heath \"Edward\nHeath\") to submit an application and lead negotiations for Britain to enter\nthe Common Market. At a meeting in January 1963, the French president [Charles\nde Gaulle](/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle \"Charles de Gaulle\") rebuffed and vetoed\nMacmillan's request to join the Common Market. Despite the veto, Britain\nrestarted talks with the [European Communities](/wiki/European_Communities\n\"European Communities\") countries in 1967; and in April 1970, shortly before\nthe [1970 general election](/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1970\n\"United Kingdom general election, 1970\") campaign, Heath—who by this time was\nthe Conservative Party leader—said that further [European\nintegration](/wiki/European_integration \"European integration\") would not\nhappen \"except with the full-hearted consent of the Parliaments and peoples of\nthe new member countries\".[5] Heath included negotiating membership in the\n1970 Conservative manifesto.[6] Heath became Prime Minister, and personally\nled many of the negotiations: he struck up a friendship with the new French\npresident [Georges Pompidou](/wiki/Georges_Pompidou \"Georges Pompidou\"), who\noversaw the lifting of the veto and thus paved the way for UK membership.\nBetween 21 and 28 October 1971 the [House of\nCommons](/wiki/British_House_of_Commons \"British House of Commons\") debated\nwhether or not the UK should become a member of the EC, with then Prime\nMinister Edward Heath commenting just before the vote:\n\n“ | But tonight when this House endorses this Motion many millions of people right across the world will rejoice that we have taken our rightful place in a truly United Europe! | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \nThe House of Commons voted 356-244 in favour of the motion, with the Prime\nMinister commenting straight afterwards on behalf of the house.\n\n“ | Resolved, That this House approves Her Majesty's Government's decision of principle to join the European Communities on the basis of the arrangements which have been negotiated. | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \nNo referendum was held when Britain agreed to an accession treaty on 22\nJanuary 1972 or when the [European Communities Act\n1972](/wiki/European_Communities_Act_1972_\\(UK\\) \"European Communities Act\n1972 \\(UK\\)\") went through the legislative process, on the grounds that to\nhold one would be unconstitutional. The United Kingdom joined the European\nCommunities on 1 January 1973, along with [Denmark](/wiki/Denmark \"Denmark\")\nand the [Republic of Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of\nIreland\"). The EC would later become the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union\n\"European Union\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Thatcher-\nloc.jpg/220px-Thatcher-loc.jpg)](/wiki/File:Thatcher-loc.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Thatcher-loc.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe support of the Conservative Party, under Leader of the Opposition\n[Margaret Thatcher](/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher \"Margaret Thatcher\"), was\nessential to the passage of the Government's European business in the House of\nCommons.\n\nThroughout this period, the Labour Party was divided, both on the substantive\nissue of EC accession and on the question of whether accession ought to be\napproved by referendum. In 1971 pro-Market figures such as [Roy\nJenkins](/wiki/Roy_Jenkins \"Roy Jenkins\"), the [Deputy Leader of the Labour\nParty](/wiki/Deputy_Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Deputy Leader of the\nLabour Party \\(UK\\)\"), said a Labour government would have agreed to the terms\nof accession secured by the Conservatives.[3] However, the [National Executive\nCommittee](/wiki/National_Executive_Committee \"National Executive Committee\")\nand the [Labour Party Conference](/wiki/Labour_Party_\\(UK\\)_Conference \"Labour\nParty \\(UK\\) Conference\") disapproved of the terms. In April 1972 the anti-EC\nConservative MP [Neil Marten](/wiki/Neil_Marten \"Neil Marten\") tabled an\namendment to the European Communities Bill, which called for a consultative\nreferendum on entry. Labour had previously opposed a referendum, but the\n[Shadow Cabinet](/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet \"Shadow Cabinet\") decided to support\nMarten's amendment. Jenkins resigned as Deputy Leader in opposition to the\ndecision, and many Labour MPs abstained on the division.\n\nAt the February 1974 general election, Labour's manifesto promised\nrenegotiation of Britain's terms of membership, to be followed by a\nconsultative referendum on continued membership under the new terms if they\nwere acceptable.[7] In the October 1974 manifesto, this was changed to the\npromise that Labour would \"give the British people the final say, which will\nbe binding on the Government – through the ballot box – on whether we accept\nthe terms and stay in or reject the terms and come out.\"[1] This could be\ninterpreted as including the option of an election in 1975;[3] however, Labour\nwon a working majority, and had no need of another general election.[8]\n\n##\nLegislation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Legislation\")]\n\nSee also: [Referendum Act 1975](/wiki/Referendum_Act_1975 \"Referendum Act\n1975\")\n\nThe government produced a white paper on the proposed referendum on 26\nFebruary 1975: it recommended core public funding for both the \"Yes\" and \"No\"\nsides, voting rights for members of the armed forces and members of the House\nof Lords, and finally a proposed single central count of the votes for the\nwhole country. This white paper was approved by the House of Commons. On 26\nMarch a Referendum Bill was introduced to the Commons; at its second reading\non 10 April, MPs voted 312-248 in favour. Prior to the bill's passing there\nwas no procedure or legislation within the United Kingdom for holding any such\nplebiscite. The vote, the only nationwide plebiscite to be held in the UK\nduring the 20th century, was of constitutional significance. Referendums had\nbeen widely opposed in the past, on the grounds that they violated the\nprinciple of [parliamentary sovereignty](/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty\n\"Parliamentary sovereignty\"). The first major referendum to be held in any\npart of the UK had been the [sovereignty referendum in Northern Ireland in\n1973](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_sovereignty_referendum,_1973 \"Northern Ireland\nsovereignty referendum, 1973\").[9] The issue of how the votes should be\ncounted caused much division as the Bill went though Parliament. The\nGovernment were of the opinion that as it was substantially different from\nthat of a general election and that as a national referendum the United\nKingdom was a single constituency and favoured an unprecedented single\nnational count of all the votes for the whole country to take place at [Earls\nCourt](/wiki/Earls_Court_Exhibition_Centre \"Earls Court Exhibition Centre\") in\n[London](/wiki/London \"London\") over several days with a single declaration of\nthe final result by the National Counting Officer (later in the legislation\nthe title was changed to Chief Counting Officer) but the proposal didn't\nattract the wider support of the [Labour Party](/wiki/Labour_Party_\\(UK\\)\n\"Labour Party \\(UK\\)\") or the opposition parties; the [Liberal\nParty](/wiki/Liberal_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Liberal Party \\(UK\\)\") favoured individual\ncounts in each of the parliamentary constituencies and tabled an amendment,\nbut was defeated by 263 to 131 votes in the House of Commons; however, another\namendment, tabled in the Commons by Labour MP [Roderick\nMacFarquhar](/wiki/Roderick_MacFarquhar \"Roderick MacFarquhar\"), sought to\nhave separate counts for each administrative region (the post-1974 county\ncouncil areas): this won cross-party support, and was carried by 272 to 155\nvotes.[3] The Act did not specify any national supermajority of \"Yes\" votes\nfor approval of the terms; a simple majority of 50% + 1 vote would suffice to\nwin the vote. It received [royal assent](/wiki/Royal_assent \"Royal assent\") on\n8 May 1975, just under a month before the vote took place.[10]\n\nDuring the legislative process, the Government also held informal talks with\nthe Governments of the [Isle of Man](/wiki/Isle_of_Man \"Isle of Man\"),\n[Jersey](/wiki/Jersey \"Jersey\") and [Guernsey](/wiki/Guernsey \"Guernsey\") to\ndiscuss the possibility of holding simultaneous referendums of their own on\ncontinued EC membership; however, the idea was dropped because the [UK\nParliament](/wiki/Houses_of_Parliament \"Houses of Parliament\") had no\njurisdiction to pass or impose legislation on those islands, being as they\nwere (and are) [Crown dependencies](/wiki/Crown_dependencies \"Crown\ndependencies\").\n\n## Referendum\nquestion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Referendum question\")]\n\nThe question that would be put to the British electorate, as set out in the\n[Act](/wiki/Referendum_Act_1975 \"Referendum Act 1975\") was:\n\n  \nThe Government has announced the results of the renegotiation of the United\nKingdom's terms of membership of the European Community.\n\n> **Do you think that the United Kingdom should stay in the European Community\n> (the Common Market)?**\n\npermitting a simple **YES** / **NO** answer (to be marked with a single (X)).\n\n  \nThe question that was used was one of the options in the Government White\nPaper of February 1975, although during the passage of the Referendum Bill\nthrough Parliament, the Government agreed to add the words \"Common Market\" in\nbrackets at the end of the question. It should be noted that the referendum\ntook place 25 years before the passing of the [Political Parties, Elections\nand Referendums Act\n2000](/wiki/Political_Parties,_Elections_and_Referendums_Act_2000 \"Political\nParties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000\") by the then [Labour\nGovernment](/wiki/Blair_Ministry \"Blair Ministry\") of [Tony\nBlair](/wiki/Tony_Blair \"Tony Blair\"), which introduced into British law a\ngeneral procedure for the holding of UK-wide referendums and effectively\ncreated the [Electoral\nCommission](/wiki/Electoral_Commission_\\(United_Kingdom\\) \"Electoral\nCommission \\(United Kingdom\\)\"), a body that would oversee such votes and also\ntest and research proposed referendum questions.\n\n##\nCampaigning[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Campaigning\")]\n\nThe referendum was called in April 1975 after the renegotiation was formally\nconcluded. Since Prime Minister [Harold Wilson](/wiki/Harold_Wilson \"Harold\nWilson\")'s [cabinet](/wiki/Second_Wilson_Ministry \"Second Wilson Ministry\")\nwas split between supporters and opponents of the Common Market, and since\nmembers of each side held their views strongly, he made the decision,\nunprecedented outside [coalition government](/wiki/Coalition_government\n\"Coalition government\"), to suspend the [constitutional\nconvention](/wiki/Constitutional_convention_\\(political_custom\\)\n\"Constitutional convention \\(political custom\\)\") of [Cabinet collective\nresponsibility](/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility \"Cabinet collective\nresponsibility\"). Cabinet members would be allowed to publicly campaign\nagainst each other. In total, seven of the twenty-three members of the cabinet\nopposed EC membership.[11] Wilson's solution was that ministers speaking in\nthe House of Commons should reflect government policy (i.e. support for EC\nmembership), but would be allowed to speak freely elsewhere, thus avoiding a\nmass dismissal of Cabinet ministers. In spite of this, one minister, [Eric\nHeffer](/wiki/Eric_Heffer \"Eric Heffer\"), was obliged to resign after speaking\nagainst EC membership in the House of Commons.\n\n### Yes campaign (Britain In\nEurope)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Yes campaign \\(Britain In Europe\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Keep_Britain_in_Europe_Logo.svg/220px-\nKeep_Britain_in_Europe_Logo.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Keep_Britain_in_Europe_Logo.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Keep_Britain_in_Europe_Logo.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLogo of the Keep Britain in Europe campaign.\n\nThe \"Yes\" campaign was officially supported by Wilson's\n[Government](/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Government \"Her Majesty's Government\")[12]\nand the majority of his cabinet, including the holders of the three other\n[Great Offices of State](/wiki/Great_Offices_of_State \"Great Offices of\nState\"): [Denis Healey](/wiki/Denis_Healey \"Denis Healey\"), the [Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer](/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer \"Chancellor of the\nExchequer\"); [James Callaghan](/wiki/James_Callaghan \"James Callaghan\"), the\n[Foreign Secretary](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs \"Secretary of\nState for Foreign Affairs\"); and Roy Jenkins, the [Home\nSecretary](/wiki/Home_Secretary \"Home Secretary\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] It was\nalso supported by the majority of the Conservative Party, including its newly\nelected leader [Margaret Thatcher](/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher \"Margaret\nThatcher\")—249 of 275 party members in Parliament supported staying in the EC\nin a [free vote](/wiki/Free_vote \"Free vote\") in April\n1975[12]—[_[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\n\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_]the Liberal Party, the [Social Democratic and\nLabour Party](/wiki/Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party \"Social Democratic and\nLabour Party\"), the [Alliance Party of Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Alliance_Party_of_Northern_Ireland \"Alliance Party of Northern\nIreland\") and the [Vanguard Unionist Progressive\nParty](/wiki/Vanguard_Unionist_Progressive_Party \"Vanguard Unionist\nProgressive Party\").\n\n### No campaign (National Referendum\nCampaign)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: No campaign \\(National Referendum Campaign\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/OutIntotheWorld_logo.png/220px-\nOutIntotheWorld_logo.png)](/wiki/File:OutIntotheWorld_logo.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:OutIntotheWorld_logo.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nLogo of the Out into the World campaign by the National Referendum Campaign.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/11.12.67_Pr%C3%A9sentation_officielle_du_Concorde_%281967%29_-_53Fi1748_%28Tony_Benn%29.jpg/220px-11.12.67_Pr%C3%A9sentation_officielle_du_Concorde_%281967%29_-_53Fi1748_%28Tony_Benn%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:11.12.67_Pr%C3%A9sentation_officielle_du_Concorde_\\(1967\\)_-_53Fi1748_\\(Tony_Benn\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:11.12.67_Pr%C3%A9sentation_officielle_du_Concorde_\\(1967\\)_-_53Fi1748_\\(Tony_Benn\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Tony Benn](/wiki/Tony_Benn \"Tony Benn\"), Secretary of State for Industry, was\none of the senior figures in the No campaign.\n\nThe influential Conservative [Edward du Cann](/wiki/Edward_du_Cann \"Edward du\nCann\") said that \"the Labour party is hopelessly and irrevocably split and\nmuddled over this issue\".[12] The \"No\" campaign included the left wing of the\nLabour Party, including the cabinet ministers [Michael\nFoot](/wiki/Michael_Foot \"Michael Foot\"), [Tony Benn](/wiki/Tony_Benn \"Tony\nBenn\"), [Peter Shore](/wiki/Peter_Shore \"Peter Shore\"), [Eric\nVarley](/wiki/Eric_Varley \"Eric Varley\"), and [Barbara\nCastle](/wiki/Barbara_Castle \"Barbara Castle\") who during the campaign\nfamously said \"They lured us into the market with the mirage of the market\nmiracle\".

At a Labour Party conference on 26\nApril 1975, the Labour membership rejected continuing EC membership by almost\na 2:1 margin. Tony Benn said, ‘We have had a conference and the decision is\nclear ... It is very clear that there now must be a move for the Labour Party\nto campaign’. The majority of the Labour Party leadership was strongly for\ncontinuing membership, and the margin of the party vote was not a surprise,\nsince only seven of forty-six trade unions present at the conference supported\nEC membership. Prior to the conference, the party had decided that if the\nconference voted by a margin of 2:1 or more in favour of a particular option,\nit would then support that position in the referendum campaign. Otherwise, the\n‘party machine’ would remain neutral.

It was common for pro-Europeans to convene\nacross party and ideological lines with businessmen.[15] [John\nMills](/wiki/John_Mills_\\(businessman\\) \"John Mills \\(businessman\\)\"), the\nnational agent of the \"No\" campaign, recalled: \"We were operating on a shoe-\nstring compared to the Rolls Royce operation on the other side\".[16] However,\nit was also the case that many [civil society](/wiki/Civil_society \"Civil\nsociety\") groups supported the \"Yes\" campaign, including the [National Farmers\nUnion](/wiki/National_Farmers_Union_\\(England_and_Wales\\) \"National Farmers\nUnion \\(England and Wales\\)\") and some trade unions.\n\nMuch of the \"Yes\" campaign focused on the credentials of its opponents.\nAccording to Alistair McAlpine, \"The whole thrust of our campaign was to\ndepict the anti-Marketeers as unreliable people – dangerous people who would\nlead you down the wrong path ... It wasn't so much that it was sensible to\nstay in, but that anybody who proposed that we came out was off their rocker\nor virtually [Marxist](/wiki/Marxist \"Marxist\").\"[16] Tony Benn\ncontroversially claimed there had been \"Half a million jobs lost in Britain\nand a huge increase in food prices as a direct result of our entry into the\nCommon Market\",[15] using his position as [Secretary of State for\nIndustry](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Business,_Energy_and_Industrial_Strategy\n\"Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\") as an\nauthority. His claims were ridiculed by the \"Yes\" campaign and ministers; the\n_[Daily Mirror](/wiki/Daily_Mirror \"Daily Mirror\")_ labelled Benn the\n\"Minister of Fear\", and other newspapers were similarly derisive. Ultimately,\nthe \"No\" campaign lacked a popular, moderate figure to play the public\nleadership role for their campaign that Jenkins and Wilson fulfilled in the\n\"Yes\" campaign.\n\n## Counting\nareas[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Counting areas\")]\n\nThe referendum was held nationally across all four countries of the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") as a single majority vote in\n68 counting areas under the provisions of the [Referendum\nAct](/wiki/Referendum_Act_1975 \"Referendum Act 1975\"), for which the then\nadministrative counties of [England](/wiki/England \"England\") and\n[Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\") and the then newly formed administrative regions\nof [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\") were used, with [Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\") as a single counting area.\n\nThe following table shows the breakdown of the voting areas for the referendum\nwithin the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\").\n\nCountry | Counting areas  \n---|---  \n**United Kingdom** | Referendum declaration;  \n68 counting areas  \nConstituent countries | Counting areas  \n---|---  \n**England** | 47 counting areas  \n**Northern Ireland** | Single counting area  \n**Scotland** | 12 counting areas  \n**Wales** | 8 counting areas  \n  \n##\nResult[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Result\")]\n\nSee also: [Results of the United Kingdom European Communities membership\nreferendum,\n1975](/wiki/Results_of_the_United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975\n\"Results of the United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum,\n1975\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum%2C_1975_by_nation.svg/200px-\nUnited_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum%2C_1975_by_nation.svg.png)](/wiki/File:United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975_by_nation.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975_by_nation.svg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nResults by nation.\n\nVoting in the referendum took place across the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") on Thursday 5 June between\n07:00 and 22:00 [BST](/wiki/British_Summer_Time \"British Summer Time\"). All\ncounting areas started their counts the following day on Friday 6 June at\n09:00 BST, and the final result was announced just before 23:00 BST by the\nChief Counting Officer (CCO) [Sir Phillip\nAllen](/wiki/Philip_Allen,_Baron_Allen_of_Abbeydale \"Philip Allen, Baron Allen\nof Abbeydale\") at [Earls Court Exhibition\nCentre](/wiki/Earls_Court_Exhibition_Centre \"Earls Court Exhibition Centre\")\nin [London](/wiki/London \"London\"), after all 68 counting areas had declared\ntheir totals. With a national turnout of 64% across the United Kingdom, the\ntarget to secure a majority for the winning side was 12,951,598 votes. The\nresult was a decisive \"Yes\" to continued EC membership, which won by a huge\nmajority of 8,908,508 votes (34.5%) over those who had voted \"No\" to reject\ncontinued membership.\n\nIn total, over two-thirds of voters supported continued EC membership. 67.2\npercent voted Yes and 32.8 percent voted No. At council level, support for EC\nmembership was positively correlated with support for the Conservative Party\nand with average income. In contrast, poorer areas that supported Labour gave\nless support to the question. Approval was well above 60% in almost every\ncouncil area in England and Wales, with the strongly Labour-supporting [Mid\nGlamorgan](/wiki/Mid_Glamorgan \"Mid Glamorgan\") being the exception. Scotland\nand Northern Ireland gave less support to the question than the British\naverage. Once the voting areas had declared, their results were then relayed\nto Sir Philip Allen, the Chief Counting Officer, who later declared the final\nresult.\n\nAll the counting areas within the United Kingdom returned large majority votes\nin favour of \"Yes\" except for two [Scottish](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\")\nregions, the [Shetland Islands](/wiki/Shetland_Islands \"Shetland Islands\") and\nthe [Western Isles](/wiki/Western_Isles \"Western Isles\"), which returned\nmajority votes in favour of a \"No\" vote.\n\nChoice | Votes | %  \n---|---|---  \n[![Referendum passed](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/14px-Yes_check.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Yes_check.svg) **Yes** | **17,378,581** | **67.23**  \nNo | 8,470,073 | 32.77  \nValid votes | 25,848,654 | 99.78  \nInvalid or blank votes | 54,540 | 0.22  \n**Total votes** | **25,903,194** | **100.00**  \nRegistered voters and turnout | 40,086,677 | 64.67  \nNational referendum results (without spoiled ballots): **Yes:**  \n_**17,378,581**_ **(67.2%)** | No:  \n_8,470,073_ (32.8%)  \n---|---  \n**▲**  \n  \n### Results by United Kingdom constituent\ncountries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Results by United Kingdom constituent countries\")]\n\n[Constituent country](/wiki/Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Countries of the United Kingdom\") | Electorate | Turnout (%) | Yes | No  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nVotes | % | Votes | %  \n[England](/wiki/England \"England\") | 33,356,208 | 64.6% | **14,918,009** | **68.7%** | 6,812,052 | 31.3%  \n[Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\") | 2,011,136 | 66.7% | **869,135** | **64.8%** | 472,071 | 35.2%  \n[Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\") | 3,688,799 | 61.7% | **1,332,186** | **58.4%** | 948,039 | 41.6%  \n[Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\") | 1,030,534 | 47.4% | **259,251** | **52.1%** | 237,911 | 47.9%  \n  \n## TV\ncoverage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: TV coverage\")]\n\nBoth the [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\") and [ITV](/wiki/ITV_\\(TV_network\\) \"ITV \\(TV\nnetwork\\)\") provided coverage throughout the following day, and the BBC\nprogramme was presented by [David Dimbleby](/wiki/David_Dimbleby \"David\nDimbleby\") and [David Butler](/wiki/David_Butler_\\(psephologist\\) \"David\nButler \\(psephologist\\)\").

Nobody in Britain or the\n> wider world should have any doubt about its meaning. It was a free vote,\n> without constraint, following a free democratic campaign conducted\n> constructively and without rancour. It means that fourteen years of national\n> argument are over. It means that all those who have had reservations about\n> Britain’s commitment should now join wholeheartedly with our partners in\n> Europe, and our friends everywhere to meet the challenge confronting the\n> whole nation.’\n\n[Enoch Powell](/wiki/Enoch_Powell \"Enoch Powell\") gave this comment to the\nresult in a newspaper a few days after the referendum:\n\n> ‘Never again by the necessity of an axiom, will an Englishman live for his\n> country or die for his country: The country for which people live and die\n> was obsolete and we have abolished it. Or not quite yet. No, not yet. The\n> referendum is not a “verdict” after which the prisoner is hanged forthwith.\n> It is no more than provisional … This will be so as long Parliament can\n> alter or undo whatever that or any other Parliament has done. Hence those\n> Golden words in the Government's Referendum pamphlet: “Our continued\n> membership would depend on the continuing assent of Parliament”.’\n\nRoy Jenkins said ‘It puts the uncertainty behind us. It commits Britain to\nEurope; it commits us to playing an active, constructive and enthusiastic role\nin it’. Tony Benn said, ‘When the British people speak, everyone, including\nmembers of Parliament, should tremble before their decision and that's\ncertainly the spirit with which I accept the result of the referendum’.[18]\nJenkins was heavily rewarded for successfully leading the campaign for Britain\nto remain a member of the [European Communities](/wiki/European_Communities\n\"European Communities\") when two years later he became the first and to date\nonly British politician to hold the post of [President of the European\nCommission](/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission \"President of the\nEuropean Commission\"), which he held for four years from 1977-81.\n\nThe result strengthened Harold Wilson's tactical position, by securing a\nfurther post-election public expression of support for his policies. According\nto Cook and Francis (1979), ‘The left of his party had been appeased by the\nholding of a referendum, the right by its result’.[3] Following the result,\nthe Labour Party and British trade unions themselves joined European\ninstitutions, such as the [Socialist\nGroup](/wiki/Socialist_Group_in_the_European_Parliament \"Socialist Group in\nthe European Parliament\") in the [European\nParliament](/wiki/European_Parliament \"European Parliament\"), to which they\nhad been reluctant to commit before public approval of EC membership.\n\nIn the House of Commons, the issue of Europe had been effectively settled for\ntwo years, until the debate about direct elections to the European Parliament\nbegan in 1977.\n\nThe result went on to provide a major pro-European mandate to politicians,\nparticularly in the [UK Parliament](/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster \"Palace of\nWestminster\"), for the next forty-one years until the [2016 EU membership\nreferendum](/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016\n\"United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016\") was held on\nThursday 23 June 2016, when the UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the\nEuropean Union. On that occasion the relative difference of enthusiasm for\nmembership was reversed, with England and Wales voting to leave, whilst\nScotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.\n\n## Thirty-year\nrule[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Thirty-year rule\")]\n\nThe question of sovereignty was discussed in an internal document of the\nForeign and Commonwealth Office (FCO 30/1048) before the European Communities\nAct 1972, but was not available to the public until January 2002 under the\n[Thirty-year rule](/wiki/Thirty-year_rule \"Thirty-year rule\"). Among \"Areas of\npolicy\" listed \"in which parliamentary freedom to legislate will be affected\nby entry into the European Communities\" were: Customs duties, Agriculture,\nFree movement of labour, services and capital, Transport, and Social Security\nfor migrant workers. The document concluded (paragraph 26) that it was\nadvisable to put the considerations of influence and power before those of\nformal sovereignty.[19]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum%2C_1975_compared_to_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum%2C_2016.svg/300px-\nUnited_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum%2C_1975_compared_to_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum%2C_2016.svg.png)](/wiki/File:United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975_compared_to_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975_compared_to_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016.svg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nComparison of results in 1975 and 2016 referendums\n\n  * [Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities](/wiki/Accession_of_the_United_Kingdom_to_the_European_Communities \"Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities\")\n  * [Treaty of Accession 1972](/wiki/Treaty_of_Accession_1972 \"Treaty of Accession 1972\")\n  * [European Communities Act 1972](/wiki/European_Communities_Act_1972_\\(UK\\) \"European Communities Act 1972 \\(UK\\)\")\n  * [Brexit](/wiki/Brexit \"Brexit\")\n  * [Referendums in the United Kingdom](/wiki/Referendums_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Referendums in the United Kingdom\")\n  * [United Kingdom general election, February 1974](/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974 \"United Kingdom general election, February 1974\")\n  * [United Kingdom general election, October 1974](/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_October_1974 \"United Kingdom general election, October 1974\")\n  * [Withdrawal from the European Union](/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union \"Withdrawal from the European Union\")\n  * [United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016](/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016 \"United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016\")\n\n## Further\nreading[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Further reading\")]\n\n  * [Butler, D](/wiki/David_Butler_\\(psephologist\\) \"David Butler \\(psephologist\\)\") and Kitzinger U. _[The 1975 Referendum](http://www.eureferendum.com/documents/1975referendum1.pdf)_ , Palgrave Macmillan UK London and New York, 1996.\n  * [Milward, A.](/wiki/Alan_Milward \"Alan Milward\") ''_The Rise and Fall of a National Strategy: The UK and The European Community: Volume 1_ , [Routledge](/wiki/Routledge \"Routledge\") London and New York, 2002, (republished 2012).\n  * [Wall, S.](/wiki/Stephen_Wall \"Stephen Wall\") _The Official History of Britain and the European Community, Volume II: From Rejection to Referendum, 1963-1975_ , [Routledge](/wiki/Routledge \"Routledge\") London and New York, 2013.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ The Labour Party (1974).
