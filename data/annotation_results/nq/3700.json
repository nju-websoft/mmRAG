She shows him a fossil\nwith an imprint of a cigarette lighter that he recognizes as his own along\nwith a crystal made into a necklace that gives off strong\n[tachyon](/wiki/Tachyon \"Tachyon\") energy. She convinces him to finish his\ntachyon amplifier and come help her on a seemingly routine expedition to the\ncave where Holly found the fossil, which is in the middle of nowhere. With\ncave gift shop owner Will Stanton they raft into the cave, where Marshall has\ndetected high levels of tachyons. He activates the tachyon amplifier,\ntriggering an earthquake that opens a time warp into which the raft falls. The\ngroup finds themselves in a desert, filled with various items from many eras,\nand without the amplifier. They rescue a primate-like creature, Cha-Ka of the\nPakuni tribe, who becomes their friend and guide.\n\nThe gang spends a night in a cave after surviving a meeting with a fast,\nintelligent [Tyrannosaurus](/wiki/Tyrannosaurus \"Tyrannosaurus\") they nickname\n\"Grumpy\", who stalks Marshall for calling him stupid. Marshall receives a\ntelepathic message begging for help and finds himself in ancient ruins. The\ngroup encounters a race of [lizard men](/wiki/List_of_reptilian_humanoids\n\"List of reptilian humanoids\") called Sleestaks before meeting the one who\nsent Marshall the telepathic message, Enik the Altrusian. He explains that he\nwas exiled by the evil Zarn who is attempting to take over Earth with his\nSleestak minions, but Enik can prevent this if Marshall retrieves the tachyon\namplifier.\n\nThe group stumble upon a desert where many things from across time end up and\nthey encounter many [Compsognathus](/wiki/Compsognathus \"Compsognathus\"),\n[Dromaeosaurs](/wiki/Dromaeosaurs \"Dromaeosaurs\"), Grumpy, and a female\n[Allosaurus](/wiki/Allosaurus \"Allosaurus\"). The Allosaurus and Grumpy battle\nit out over a previously killed ice-cream seller until they sense Marshall and\nchase him. Marshall kills the Allosaurus with [liquid\nnitrogen](/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen \"Liquid nitrogen\") and finds that the\namplifier was eaten by the Allosaurus. The amplifier is then stolen by a\n[Pteranodon](/wiki/Pteranodon \"Pteranodon\") and taken to its nest. The group\narrives at the nest and Marshall lightly steps through the Pteranodon eggs to\nretrieve the amplifier, but when he reaches it, it stops broadcasting the\nsoundtrack to Marshall's favorite musical _[A Chorus Line](/wiki/A_Chorus_Line\n\"A Chorus Line\")_. When the eggs begin to hatch, Holly realizes that the music\nwas acting as a sort of lullaby keeping the baby Pteranodons asleep. Marshall,\nWill and Holly belt out \"[I Hope I Get It](/wiki/I_Hope_I_Get_It \"I Hope I Get\nIt\")\", with Cha-ka inexplicably joining in, displaying an impressive singing\nvoice.\n\nMarshall, Will and Cha-ka celebrate their good fortune. Meanwhile, Holly\npockets a dinosaur egg and learns from a recording left by the long-deceased\nZarn that Enik deceived them and he is actually the one planning to invade\nEarth. But she is captured by the Sleestaks to be brought to the Library of\nSkulls for judgment. The others save her from being executed for helping Enik,\nbut the villain—now possessing the amplifier, and mind-controlling the\nSleestaks—leaves them to open a portal to Earth. Marshall pole vaults into\nGrumpy's mouth and after removing an intestinal blockage, befriends him. He\njoins the others to defeat the Sleestak army and confront Enik. After the\ncrystal link between the Land of the Lost and Earth is shattered, Enik reveals\nthe portal will close forever. Thinking fast, Marshall grabs Holly's crystal\nand inserts it into the port, knowing that the substitute crystal won't hold\nfor long. Will chooses to stay behind to live a better life and to prevent\nEnik from following Marshall and Holly back to Earth, learning later that\nfemale Pakuni are very attractive.\n\nA triumphant Marshall again appears on _Today_ with the dinosaur egg Holly\nbrought back to promote his new book _Matt Lauer Can Suck It_. The egg left\nbehind on the _Today_ set hatches a baby Sleestak, which hisses as the screen\ngoes black.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_the_Lost_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Will Ferrell](/wiki/Will_Ferrell \"Will Ferrell\") as [Dr. Rick Marshall](/wiki/List_of_Land_of_the_Lost_characters_and_species#The_Marshalls \"List of Land of the Lost characters and species\"), a renowned paleontologist and author, determined to prove his theory on time warps, thus embarking on a time travel experiment.\n  * [Anna Friel](/wiki/Anna_Friel \"Anna Friel\") as Holly Cantrell, Rick's biggest fan.\n  * [Danny McBride](/wiki/Danny_McBride \"Danny McBride\") as Will Stanton, a gift shop owner who takes Holly and Rick to a tachyon rich cave.\n  * [Jorma Taccone](/wiki/Jorma_Taccone \"Jorma Taccone\") as [Cha-Ka](/wiki/List_of_Land_of_the_Lost_characters_and_species#Ta,_Sa,_and_Cha-Ka \"List of Land of the Lost characters and species\")\n  * [John Boylan](/wiki/John_Boylan_\\(Canadian_actor\\) \"John Boylan \\(Canadian actor\\)\") as [Enik](/wiki/List_of_Land_of_the_Lost_characters_and_species#Enik \"List of Land of the Lost characters and species\") who plans to invade and conquer Earth, and deceives Rick and the others into believing otherwise; he also controls the Sleestak.\n  * [Matt Lauer](/wiki/Matt_Lauer \"Matt Lauer\") as Himself\n  * [Leonard Nimoy](/wiki/Leonard_Nimoy \"Leonard Nimoy\") as voice of [The Zarn](/wiki/List_of_Land_of_the_Lost_characters_and_species#The_Zarn \"List of Land of the Lost characters and species\")\n  * [Douglas Tait](/wiki/Douglas_Tait_\\(stuntman\\) \"Douglas Tait \\(stuntman\\)\") as [Sleestak](/wiki/Sleestak \"Sleestak\")\n\nThe original actors who played Holly and Will in the TV series, [Kathy\nColeman](/wiki/Kathy_Coleman \"Kathy Coleman\") and [Wesley\nEure](/wiki/Wesley_Eure \"Wesley Eure\"), filmed [cameos](/wiki/Cameo_appearance\n\"Cameo appearance\") for the film.[4] However, the final version of the film\ncut these scenes.[4] [Bobb'e J.

While the first names remain the same, the\nfilm converts the Holly character into an unrelated research assistant to\nallow for more risque humor because she is the main character's love\ninterest.[11] Will, instead of being a son, is an amusement park operator and\n[survivalist](/wiki/Survivalism \"Survivalism\").[12] Rick Marshall is a\npaleontologist in the film, not a park ranger as in the original series. The\nfilm's budget also uses CGI [special effects](/wiki/Special_effects \"Special\neffects\") rather than the puppet and [stop motion](/wiki/Stop_motion \"Stop\nmotion\") animation effects that defined the original series.\"[13] While the\noriginal [Saturday morning](/wiki/Saturday_morning_cartoon \"Saturday morning\ncartoon\") show targeted a child audience, the film was designed for a more\nadult audience and includes profanity, sex, and a drug reference, among other\nadult-oriented items.[14]\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_the_Lost_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\n### Critical\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_the_Lost_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Critical response\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Anna_Friel_TCA_2015.jpg/170px-\nAnna_Friel_TCA_2015.jpg)](/wiki/File:Anna_Friel_TCA_2015.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Anna_Friel_TCA_2015.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDespite negative reviews towards the film, [Anna Friel](/wiki/Anna_Friel \"Anna\nFriel\")'s performance was praised by some critics.\n\n[Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\") reports an approval\nrating of 26% based on 188 reviews, with an average rating of 4.1/10.

Confronted with such effects, the actors make not the slightest effort to appear terrified, amazed or sometimes even mildly concerned. Some might consider that a weakness.
