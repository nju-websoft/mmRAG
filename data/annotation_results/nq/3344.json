        "# History of Costa Rica\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe first natives in Costa Rica were hunters and gatherers, and Costa Rica\nserved as an \"Intermediate Region\" between Mesoamerican and Andean native\ncultures.\n\nIn 1502, [Christopher Columbus](/wiki/Christopher_Columbus \"Christopher\nColumbus\") made landfall in Costa Rica. Soon after, his forces overcame the\n[indigenous people](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_Costa_Rica \"Indigenous peoples\nof Costa Rica\"). He incorporated the territory into the [Captaincy General of\nGuatemala](/wiki/Captaincy_General_of_Guatemala \"Captaincy General of\nGuatemala\") as a province of [New Spain](/wiki/New_Spain \"New Spain\") in 1524.\nFor the next 300 years, Costa Rica was a colony of Spain. As a result, Costa\nRica's culture has been greatly influenced by the culture of Spain.[1] During\nthis period, Costa Rica remained sparsely developed and impoverished.\n\nFollowing the [Mexican War of Independence](/wiki/Mexican_War_of_Independence\n\"Mexican War of Independence\") (1810–1821), Costa Rica became part of the\nindependent [Mexican Empire](/wiki/First_Mexican_Empire \"First Mexican\nEmpire\") in 1821. Subsequently, Costa Rica was part of the [Federal Republic\nof Central America](/wiki/Federal_Republic_of_Central_America \"Federal\nRepublic of Central America\") in 1823, before gaining full independence in\n1838. Its economy struggled due to lack of connections with European\nsuppliers. In 1856, Costa Rica resisted [American](/wiki/Americans\n\"Americans\") settlers from mounting a take-over of the government.\n\nAfter 1869, Costa Rica established a democratic government.[1]\n\nAfter the [Costa Rican Civil War](/wiki/Costa_Rican_Civil_War \"Costa Rican\nCivil War\") in 1948, the government drafted a new\n[constitution](/wiki/Constitution \"Constitution\"), guaranteeing universal\nsuffrage and the dismantling of the military. Today, Costa Rica is a democracy\nthat relies on [technology](/wiki/Technology \"Technology\") and [eco-\ntourism](/wiki/Eco-tourism \"Eco-tourism\") for its economy. Although\n[poverty](/wiki/Poverty \"Poverty\") has declined since the turn of the 21st\ncentury, economic problems still exist. Costa Rica is facing problems of\n[underemployment](/wiki/Underemployment \"Underemployment\"), foreign and\ninternal debt, and a trade deficiency.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Pre-Columbian Costa Rica\n    * 1.1 Hunter-gatherers (10,000–2,000 BC)\n  * 2 Spanish colonization\n  * 3 Independence from Spain\n  * 4 United Provinces of Central America\n  * 5 Democracy\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 Further reading\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Pre-Columbian Costa\nRica[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Costa_Rica&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Pre-Columbian Costa Rica\")]\n\nMain article: [Pre-Columbian history of Costa Rica](/wiki/Pre-\nColumbian_history_of_Costa_Rica \"Pre-Columbian history of Costa Rica\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Ceramicas_Nicoya.jpg/300px-\nCeramicas_Nicoya.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ceramicas_Nicoya.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ceramicas_Nicoya.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPre-Columbian Ceramics from Nicoya, Costa Rica\n\nIn [Pre-Columbian](/wiki/Pre-Columbian \"Pre-Columbian\") times, the [Native\nAmericans](/wiki/Native_American_\\(Americas\\) \"Native American \\(Americas\\)\")\nin what is now [Costa Rica](/wiki/Costa_Rica \"Costa Rica\") were part of a\ncultural complex known as the \"Intermediate Area,\" between the\n[Mesoamerican](/wiki/Mesoamerican \"Mesoamerican\") and [Andean](/wiki/Andean\n\"Andean\") cultural regions.[2]\n\nThe northwest of the country, the [Nicoya Peninsula](/wiki/Nicoya_Peninsula\n\"Nicoya Peninsula\"), was the southernmost point of [Nahuatl](/wiki/Nahuatl\n\"Nahuatl\") cultural influence when the [Spanish](/wiki/Spain \"Spain\")\nconquerors ([conquistadores](/wiki/Conquistadores \"Conquistadores\")) came in\nthe sixteenth century. The central and southern portions of the country had\n[Chibcha](/wiki/Chibcha \"Chibcha\") influences. The indigenous people have\ninfluenced modern Costa Rican culture to a relatively small degree. In the\nyears soon after European encounter, many of the people died due to\n[infectious diseases](/wiki/Infectious_diseases \"Infectious diseases\"), such\nas [measles](/wiki/Measles \"Measles\") and [smallpox](/wiki/Smallpox\n\"Smallpox\"), which were endemic among the Europeans but to which they had no\nimmunity.[3]\n\n### Hunter-gatherers (10,000–2,000\nBC)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Costa_Rica&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Hunter-gatherers \\(10,000–2,000 BC\\)\")]\n\nThe oldest evidence of human occupation in [Costa Rica](/wiki/Costa_Rica\n\"Costa Rica\") is associated with the arrival of groups of hunter-gatherers\nabout 10,000 to 7,000 years [BC](/wiki/Anno_Domini \"Anno Domini\"), with\nancient archaeological evidence (stone tool making) located in the [Turrialba\nValley](/wiki/Turrialba,_Costa_Rica \"Turrialba, Costa Rica\"), at sites called\nGuardiria and Florence, with matching quarry and workshop areas with presence\nof type [clovis spearheads](/wiki/Clovis_culture \"Clovis culture\") and South\nAmerican inspired [arrows](/wiki/Arrow \"Arrow\"). All this suggests the\npossibility that in this area two different cultures coexisted.\n\nThe people of this era were nomadic. They were organized in family-based bands\nof about 20 to 30 members. Their usual prey animals were called megafauna,\nsuch as giant [armadillos](/wiki/Armadillo \"Armadillo\") and\n[sloths](/wiki/Sloth \"Sloth\"), [mastodons](/wiki/Mastodons \"Mastodons\"), etc.\nThese became extinct about 8,000 years before the modern era. The first\nsettlers had to adapt to hunting smaller animals and develop appropriate\nstrategies to adjust to the new conditions.\n\n## Spanish\ncolonization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Costa_Rica&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Spanish colonization\")]\n\nThe colonial period began when [Christopher\nColumbus](/wiki/Christopher_Columbus \"Christopher Columbus\") reached the\neastern coast of Costa Rica on his [fourth\nvoyage](/wiki/Voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus \"Voyages of Christopher\nColumbus\") on September 18, 1502. Numerous subsequent Spanish expeditions\nfollowed, eventually leading to the first Spanish colony in Costa Rica, Villa\nBruselas founded in 1524.[4]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Pablo_Presbere_Album_de_Figueroa_%281%29.jpg/220px-\nPablo_Presbere_Album_de_Figueroa_%281%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pablo_Presbere_Album_de_Figueroa_\\(1\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pablo_Presbere_Album_de_Figueroa_\\(1\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nViolent uprising of Indians in Talamanca region, 1709\n\nDuring most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province\nof the [Captaincy General of Guatemala](/wiki/Captaincy_General_of_Guatemala\n\"Captaincy General of Guatemala\"), which was nominally part of the\n[Viceroyalty of New Spain](/wiki/New_Spain \"New Spain\") (i.e.,\n[Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\")). In practice it operated as a largely\nautonomous entity within the [Spanish Empire](/wiki/Spanish_Empire \"Spanish\nEmpire\"). Costa Rica's distance from the capital in\n[Guatemala](/wiki/Guatemala \"Guatemala\"), its legal prohibition under Spanish\nlaw against trading with its southern neighbors in [Panama](/wiki/Panama\n\"Panama\"), then part of the [Viceroyalty of New\nGranada](/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_New_Granada \"Viceroyalty of New Granada\") (i.e.,\n[Colombia](/wiki/Colombia \"Colombia\")), and the lack of resources such as\n[gold](/wiki/Gold \"Gold\") and [silver](/wiki/Silver \"Silver\"), resulted in\nCosta Rica attracting few inhabitants. It was a poor, isolated, and sparsely\ninhabited region within the Spanish Empire.[5] a Spanish governor in 1719\ndescribed Costa Rica as \"the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all\nAmerica.\" [6]\n\nThe area suffered a lack of indigenous population available for [forced\nlabor](/wiki/Encomienda \"Encomienda\"), which meant that most of the Costa\nRican settlers had to work their own land. This prevented the establishment of\nlarge _[haciendas](/wiki/Hacienda \"Hacienda\")_. For all these reasons Costa\nRica was by and large unappreciated and overlooked by the [Spanish\nCrown](/wiki/Habsburg_Spain \"Habsburg Spain\") and left to develop on its own.\nThe small landowners' relative poverty, the lack of a large indigenous labor\nforce, the population's ethnic and linguistic homogeneity, and Costa Rica's\nisolation from the Spanish colonial centers in Mexico and the Andes, all\ncontributed to the development of an autonomous and individualistic agrarian\nsociety. Even the Governor had to farm his own crops and tend to his own\ngarden due to his poverty.[7][_[disputed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement\n\"Wikipedia:Disputed statement\") –\n[discuss](/wiki/Talk:History_of_Costa_Rica#Disputed_Statement \"Talk:History of\nCosta Rica\")_]\n\n## Independence from\nSpain[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Costa_Rica&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Independence from Spain\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Castro_Madriz.JPG/190px-\nJos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Castro_Madriz.JPG)](/wiki/File:Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Castro_Madriz.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Castro_Madriz.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[José María Castro Madriz](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Castro_Madriz \"José\nMaría Castro Madriz\") formally declared Costa Rica as independent from the\n[Federal Republic of Central\nAmerica](/wiki/Federal_Republic_of_Central_America \"Federal Republic of\nCentral America\") in 1848.\n\nIn the early 19th century, [Napoleon](/wiki/Napoleon_I \"Napoleon I\")'s\noccupation of Spain led to the outbreak of revolts all across Spanish America.\nIn New Spain, all of the fighting by those seeking independence was done in\nthe center of that area from 1810 to 1821, what today is central Mexico. Once\nthe Viceroy was defeated in the capital city—today Mexico City—in 1821, the\nnews of independence was sent to all the territories of New Spain, including\nthe Intendencies of the former Captaincy of Guatemala. Costa Rica joined the\nother Central American Intendancies in a joint declaration of independence\nfrom Spain, the 1821 Act of Independence.\n\nOn October 13, 1821 the documents arrived at Cartago, and an emergency meeting\nwas called upon by Governor Juan Manuel de Cañas. There were many ideas on\nwhat to do upon gaining independence, such as joining Mexico, joining\nGuatemala or Nueva Granada (today Colombia). A group was declared (Junta de\nLegados), which created the temporary Junta Gubernativa Superior. Meanwhile,\n\"the clouds clear up\" (\"Mientras se aclaraban los nublados del día\"), was a\nfamous phrase of the events of the day.\n\nIndependence from Spain was acknowledged and ratified on October 29, 1821 by\nthe colonial authorities. It was then ratified in the cities of San José on\nNovember 1, 1821, at Cartago on November 3rd, 1821, at Heredia on November 11,\n1821, and Alajuela on November 25th, 1821.[8]\n\nAfter the declaration of independence, the New Spain parliament intended to\nestablish a commonwealth whereby the King of Spain, Ferdinand VII, would also\nbe Emperor of New Spain, but in which both countries were to be governed by\nseparate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse\nthe position, the law provided for a member of the [House of\nBourbon](/wiki/House_of_Bourbon \"House of Bourbon\") to accede to the New Spain\nthrone. Ferdinand VII did not recognize the colony's independence and said\nthat Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of New\nSpain.\n\nBy request of Parliament, the president of the regency, Agustín de Iturbide,\nwas proclaimed emperor of New Spain, which was renamed as Mexico. The Mexican\nEmpire was the official name given to this monarchical regime from 1821 to\n1823. The territory of the Mexican Empire included the continental\nintendancies and provinces of New Spain proper (including those of the former\nCaptaincy General of Guatemala) (See: History of Central America).\n\n## United Provinces of Central\nAmerica[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Costa_Rica&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: United Provinces of Central America\")]\n\nIn 1823, a revolution in Mexico ousted Emperor [Agustín de\nIturbide](/wiki/Agust%C3%ADn_de_Iturbide \"Agustín de Iturbide\"). A new Mexican\ncongress voted to allow the Central American Intendancies to decide their own\nfate. That year, the [United Provinces of Central\nAmerica](/wiki/United_Provinces_of_Central_America \"United Provinces of\nCentral America\") was formed of the five Central American Intendancies under\nGeneral [Manuel José Arce](/wiki/Manuel_Jos%C3%A9_Arce \"Manuel José Arce\").\nThe Intendancies took the new name of States. The United Provinces federation,\nnot strongly united to begin with, rapidly disintegrated under the pressures\nof intra-provincial rivalries.\n\nFollowing full independence in 1838, Costa Rica had no regular trade routes\nestablished to export their [coffee](/wiki/Coffee \"Coffee\") to European\nmarkets. They had problems with lack of infrastructure producing problems in\ntransportation: the coffee-growing areas were mainly in the Central Valley and\nhad access only to the port of [Puntarenas](/wiki/Puntarenas \"Puntarenas\") on\nthe Pacific Coast. Before the [Panama Canal](/wiki/Panama_Canal \"Panama\nCanal\") was opened, ships from Europe had to sail around [Cape\nHorn](/wiki/Cape_Horn \"Cape Horn\") in order to get to the Pacific Coast. In\n1843, the country established a trade route to Europe with the help of\n[William Le Lacheur](/wiki/William_Le_Lacheur \"William Le Lacheur\"), a\n[Guernsey](/wiki/Guernsey \"Guernsey\") merchant and shipowner.\n\nIn 1856, [William Walker](/wiki/William_Walker_\\(filibuster\\) \"William Walker\n\\(filibuster\\)\"), an American [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster_\\(military\\)\n\"Filibuster \\(military\\)\"), began incursions into Central America. After\nlanding in [Nicaragua](/wiki/Nicaragua \"Nicaragua\"), he proclaimed himself as\npresident of Nicaragua and re-instated [slavery](/wiki/Slavery \"Slavery\"),\nwhich had been abolished.[9] He intended to expand into Costa Rica and after\nhe entered that territory, the country declared\n[war](/wiki/Campaign_of_1856%E2%80%931857 \"Campaign of 1856–1857\") against his\nforces. Led by Commander in Chief of the Army of Costa Rica, President [Juan\nRafael Mora Porras](/wiki/Juan_Rafael_Mora_Porras \"Juan Rafael Mora Porras\"),\nthe filibusters were defeated and forced out of the country. Costa Rican\nforces followed the filibusters into [Rivas, Nicaragua](/wiki/Rivas,_Nicaragua\n\"Rivas, Nicaragua\"), where in a final battle, William Walker and his forces\nwere finally pushed back. [Juan Santamaría](/wiki/Juan_Santamar%C3%ADa \"Juan\nSantamaría\"), a drummer boy from [Alajuela](/wiki/Alajuela \"Alajuela\") who\nlost his life torching the filibusters' stronghold, was killed in this final\nbattle. He is today remembered as a national hero.[10]\n\n##\nDemocracy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Costa_Rica&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Democracy\")]\n\nAn era of peaceful democracy in Costa Rica began in 1869 with elections. Costa\nRica has avoided much of the violence that has plagued [Central\nAmerica](/wiki/Central_America \"Central America\"). Since the late nineteenth\ncentury, only two brief periods of violence have marred its democratic\ndevelopment. In 1917–19, [Federico Tinoco\nGranados](/wiki/Federico_Tinoco_Granados \"Federico Tinoco Granados\") ruled as\na [dictator](/wiki/Dictator \"Dictator\").\n\nIn 1948, [José Figueres Ferrer](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Figueres_Ferrer \"José Figueres\nFerrer\") led an armed uprising in the wake of a disputed presidential\nelection. \"With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day [Costa Rican Civil\nWar](/wiki/Costa_Rican_Civil_War \"Costa Rican Civil War\") resulting from this\nuprising was the bloodiest event in twentieth-century Costa Rican\nhistory.\"[11] The victorious [junta](/wiki/Military_junta \"Military junta\")\ndrafted a constitution guaranteeing free elections with universal suffrage and\nthe abolition of the military. Figueres became a national hero, winning the\nfirst election under the new constitution in 1953. Since then Costa Rica has\nbeen one of the few democracies to operate without a standing army.[12] The\nnation has held 16 successive presidential elections, all peaceful, [the\nlatest being in 2014](/wiki/Costa_Rican_general_election,_2014 \"Costa Rican\ngeneral election, 2014\").\n\nCosta Rica's economy went under a transformation in 1978. The country went\nfrom being \"an economic development success story\" to entering a severe socio-\neconomic crisis. Costa Rica relied on the exportation of\n[bananas](/wiki/Bananas \"Bananas\") and coffee. In 1978, coffee prices dropped,\nand its revenues declined. In 1979, the price of oil, a main imported item,\nincreased sharply and rapidly, plunging the country into crisis. In order to\nhelp improve the economy, President Rodrigo Carazo continued to borrow money\ninternationally. In return, this led the country to be more in\n[debt](/wiki/National_debt \"National debt\").[13]\n\nOnce a largely agricultural country, Costa Rica has transformed to relying on\ntechnology industry and services, and [eco-tourism](/wiki/Eco-tourism \"Eco-\ntourism\"). Costa Rica's major source of export income is technology based.\nMicrosoft, Motorola, Intel and other technology-related firms have established\noperations in Costa Rica. Local companies create and export\n[software](/wiki/Software \"Software\") as well as other computer-related\nproducts. Tourism is growing at an accelerated pace, and many believe that\nincome from this tourism may soon become the major contributor to the nation's\nGDP. Traditional agriculture, particularly coffee and bananas, continues to be\nan important part of Costa Rica's exports.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Pre-\nColumbian_incense_burner%2C_Costa_Rica_%28Carlos_Museum%29.jpg/200px-Pre-\nColumbian_incense_burner%2C_Costa_Rica_%28Carlos_Museum%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pre-\nColumbian_incense_burner,_Costa_Rica_\\(Carlos_Museum\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pre-Columbian_incense_burner,_Costa_Rica_\\(Carlos_Museum\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nA Pre-Columbian incense burner with a crocodile lid (500 - 1350 CE).\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Costa_Rica&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of Presidents of Costa Rica](/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Costa_Rica \"List of Presidents of Costa Rica\")\n  * [Politics of Costa Rica](/wiki/Politics_of_Costa_Rica \"Politics of Costa Rica\")\n\n**General:**\n\n  * [History of Central America](/wiki/History_of_Central_America \"History of Central America\")\n  * [Spanish colonization of the Americas](/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas \"Spanish colonization of the Americas\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Costa_Rica&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ \"Costa Rica.\" _Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia_ (2014): 1p. 1.; accessed 19 February 2015.\n  2. **Jump up ^** [Greater Nicoya Culture - Precolumbian culture of Costa Rica and Nicaragua Nicoya](http://archaeology.about.com/od/nterms/a/nicoya.htm)\n  3. **Jump up ^** [The Story Of...
