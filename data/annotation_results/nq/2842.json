Its obverse has featured the\nprofile of [Queen Elizabeth II](/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II \"Queen Elizabeth II\")\nsince the coin's introduction in 1968, replacing the [two shilling\ncoin](/wiki/Two_shilling_coin \"Two shilling coin\") in preparation for\n[decimalisation](/wiki/Decimal_Day \"Decimal Day\") in 1971.[1] Four different\nportraits of the Queen have been used on the coin, with the latest design by\n[Jody Clark](/wiki/Jody_Clark \"Jody Clark\") being introduced in 2015. The\nsecond and current reverse, featuring a segment of the [Royal\nShield](/wiki/Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Royal coat of arms of\nthe United Kingdom\"), was introduced in 2008.\n\n[Five pence](/wiki/Five_pence_\\(British_coin\\) \"Five pence \\(British coin\\)\")\nand ten pence coins are [legal tender](/wiki/Legal_tender \"Legal tender\") only\nup to the sum of £5; this means that it is permissible to refuse payment of\nsums greater than this amount in 5p and 10p coins in order to settle a\n[debt](/wiki/Debt \"Debt\").[2]\n\nThe ten pence coin was originally minted from cupro-nickel (75%\n[Cu](/wiki/Copper \"Copper\"), 25% [Ni](/wiki/Nickel \"Nickel\")), but since 2012\nit has been minted in nickel-plated steel due to the increasing price of\nmetal. From January 2013 the [Royal Mint](/wiki/Royal_Mint \"Royal Mint\") began\na programme to gradually remove the previous cupro-nickel coins from\ncirculation with replacement by the nickel-plated steel versions.[3]\n\nAs of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,631 million 10p coins in\ncirculation with an estimated face value of £163.080 million.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Design\n    * 1.1 Obverse\n    * 1.2 Reverse\n  * 2 Mintages\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n##\nDesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ten_pence_\\(British_coin\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Design\")]\n\n###\nObverse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ten_pence_\\(British_coin\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Obverse\")]\n\nTo date, four different [obverses](/wiki/Obverse \"Obverse\") have been used. In\nall cases, the inscription until 2015 was ELIZABETH II\n[D.G.REG.F.D.](/wiki/British_coinage#D.G.REG.F.D. \"British coinage\") 2013,[5]\nwhere 2013 is replaced by the year of minting. In the original design both\nsides of the coin are encircled by dots, a common feature on coins, known as\nbeading.\n\nAs with all new decimal currency, until 1984 the portrait of [Queen Elizabeth\nII](/wiki/Elizabeth_II \"Elizabeth II\") by [Arnold Machin](/wiki/Arnold_Machin\n\"Arnold Machin\") appeared on the obverse,[6] in which the Queen wears the\n['Girls of Great Britain and Ireland'\nTiara](/wiki/Girls_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_Tiara \"Girls of Great Britain\nand Ireland Tiara\").\n\nBetween 1985 and 1997 the portrait by [Raphael Maklouf](/wiki/Raphael_Maklouf\n\"Raphael Maklouf\") was used,[6] in which the Queen wears the [George IV State\nDiadem](/wiki/George_IV_State_Diadem \"George IV State Diadem\").\n\nOn 30th September 1992 a reduced size version of the 10 pence coin was\nintroduced. The older and larger version of the coin was withdrawn from\ncirculation on 30th June 1993. The design remained unchanged.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2015 the portrait by [Ian Rank-Broadley](/wiki/Ian_Rank-Broadley\n\"Ian Rank-Broadley\") was used,[6] again featuring the\n[tiara](/wiki/Girls_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_Tiara \"Girls of Great Britain\nand Ireland Tiara\"), with a signature-mark IRB below the portrait.\n\nAs of June 2015, coins bearing the portrait by [Jody Clark](/wiki/Jody_Clark\n\"Jody Clark\") have been seen in circulation.\n\n###\nReverse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ten_pence_\\(British_coin\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Reverse\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/British_ten_pence_coin_1992_reverse.png/100px-\nBritish_ten_pence_coin_1992_reverse.png)](/wiki/File:British_ten_pence_coin_1992_reverse.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:British_ten_pence_coin_1992_reverse.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nOriginal reverse: 1968–2008\n\nThe original [reverse](/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse \"Obverse and reverse\") of the\ncoin, designed by [Christopher Ironside](/wiki/Christopher_Ironside\n\"Christopher Ironside\"), and used from 1968 to 2008, is a crowned lion\n(formally, _Part of the crest of England, a lion passant guardant royally\ncrowned_), with the numeral \"10\" below the lion, and either NEW PENCE\n(1968–1981) or TEN PENCE (1982–2008) above the lion.\n\nIn August 2005 the [Royal Mint](/wiki/Royal_Mint \"Royal Mint\") launched a\n[competition](/wiki/Coins_of_the_pound_sterling#Reverse_designs_\\(from_2008\\)\n\"Coins of the pound sterling\") to find new reverse designs for all circulating\ncoins apart from the £2 coin.[7] The winner, announced in April 2008, was\n[Matthew Dent](/wiki/Matthew_Dent_\\(designer\\) \"Matthew Dent \\(designer\\)\"),\nwhose designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage\nfrom mid-2008.[8] The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins\ndepict sections of the [Royal\nShield](/wiki/Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Royal coat of arms of\nthe United Kingdom\") that form the whole shield when placed together. The\nshield in its entirety is featured on the £1 coin. The 10p coin depicts the\nfirst quarter of the shield, showing the lions passant from the Royal Banner\nof England, with the words TEN PENCE above the shield design. The coin's\nobverse remains largely unchanged, but the beading (the ring of dots around\nthe coin's circumference), which no longer features on the coin's reverse, has\nalso been removed from the obverse.\n\nIn March 2018, 26 new designs were released each for every letter of the\nalphabet, representing the best of Britain.[9][10]\n\n  * A – _[Angel of the North](/wiki/Angel_of_the_North \"Angel of the North\")_\n  * B – _[James Bond](/wiki/James_Bond \"James Bond\")_\n  * C – [Cricket](/wiki/Cricket \"Cricket\")\n  * D – [Double-decker bus](/wiki/Double-decker_bus \"Double-decker bus\")\n  * E – [English breakfast](/wiki/English_breakfast \"English breakfast\")\n  * F – [Fish and chips](/wiki/Fish_and_chips \"Fish and chips\")\n  * G – [Greenwich Mean Time](/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time \"Greenwich Mean Time\")\n  * H – [House of Commons](/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom \"House of Commons of the United Kingdom\")\n  * I – [Ice cream](/wiki/Ice_cream \"Ice cream\")\n  * J – [Jubilee](/wiki/Jubilee \"Jubilee\")\n  * K – [King Arthur](/wiki/King_Arthur \"King Arthur\")\n  * L – [Loch Ness Monster](/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster \"Loch Ness Monster\")\n  * M – [Mackintosh](/wiki/Mackintosh \"Mackintosh\")\n  * N – [Nurses](/wiki/Nurse \"Nurse\")\n  * O – [Oak](/wiki/Oak \"Oak\")\n  * P – [Post box](/wiki/Post_box \"Post box\")\n  * Q – [Queuing](/wiki/Queuing \"Queuing\")\n  * R – [Robin](/wiki/European_robin \"European robin\")\n  * S – [Stonehenge](/wiki/Stonehenge \"Stonehenge\")\n  * T – [Teapot](/wiki/Teapot \"Teapot\")\n  * U – [Union Flag](/wiki/Union_Flag \"Union Flag\")\n  * V – [Village](/wiki/Village \"Village\")\n  * W – [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\")\n  * X – [X marks the spot](/wiki/X_marks_the_spot \"X marks the spot\")\n  * Y – [Yeoman](/wiki/Yeoman \"Yeoman\")\n  * Z – [Zebra crossing](/wiki/Zebra_crossing \"Zebra crossing\")\n\n##\nMintages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ten_pence_\\(British_coin\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Mintages\")]\n\nMachin portrait\n\n  * 1968 ~ 336,143,25\n  * 1969 ~ 314,008,000\n  * 1970 ~ 133,571,000\n  * 1971 ~ 63,205,000\n  * 1972 ~ 2,500,000\n  * 1973 ~ 152,174,000\n  * 1974 ~ 92,741,000\n  * 1975 ~ 181,559,000\n  * 1976 ~ 228,220,000\n  * 1977 ~ 59,323,000\n  * 1978 ~ 5,000,000\n  * 1979 ~ 115,457,000\n  * 1980 ~ 88,650,000\n  * 1981 ~ 3,487,000\n  * 1982–(1992) ~ none\n\nMaklouf portrait\n\n  * 1990 ~ 1,000\n  * 1991 ~ 750\n  * 1992 ~ 1,413,455,170\n  * 1993 ~ 250 (nearly all in england)\n  * 1994 ~ 500\n  * 1995 ~ 35,444,000\n  * 1996 ~ 118,738,000\n  * 1997 ~ 57,671,967\n\nRank-Broadley portrait\n\n  * 1998–1999 ~ none\n  * 2000 ~ 134,727,000\n  * 2001 ~ 82,081,000\n  * 2002 ~ 80,934,000\n  * 2003 ~ 88,118,000\n  * 2004 ~ 319,602,000\n  * 2005 ~ 69,604,000\n  * 2006 ~ 118,803,000\n  * 2007 ~ 72,720,000\n  * 2008 ~ 9,720,000 (Ironside)\n  * 2008 ~ 71,447,000 (Dent)\n  * 2009 ~ 84,360,000\n  * 2010 ~ 96,600,500\n  * 2011 ~ 369,603,850\n  * 2012 ~ 11,600,030\n  * 2013 ~ 320,200,750\n  * 2014 ~ 299,077,000\n  * 2015 ~ 119,000,000\n\nJody Clark portrait\n\n  * 2015 ~ 91,900,000\n  * 2016 ~ 135,200,000\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ten_pence_\\(British_coin\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Bignell, C P.
