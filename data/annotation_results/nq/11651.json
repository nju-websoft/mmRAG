        "# List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley on the Sun label\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**[Elvis Presley](/wiki/Elvis_Presley \"Elvis Presley\")** recorded at least 24\nsongs at **[Sun Studio](/wiki/Sun_Studio \"Sun Studio\")** in\n[Memphis](/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee \"Memphis, Tennessee\"), Tennessee, between\n1953 and 1955. The recordings reflect the wide variety of music that could be\nheard in Memphis at the time: [blues](/wiki/Blues \"Blues\"), [rhythm &\nblues](/wiki/Rhythm_%26_blues \"Rhythm & blues\"), [gospel](/wiki/Gospel\n\"Gospel\"), [country & western](/wiki/Country_%26_western \"Country & western\"),\n[hillbilly](/wiki/Hillbilly \"Hillbilly\"), and\n[bluegrass](/wiki/Bluegrass_music \"Bluegrass music\"). Because of the\nrecordings' historical significance in the foundation of rock and roll music,\nthey were inducted into the US Congress's National Recording Registry in\n2002.[1]\n\nOf the 24 known tapes, 22 survive. Ten were released by Sun as Elvis' first\nfive singles between 1954 and 1955. With the exception of the first four\nsongs, which were demos recorded at Presley's expense, all of the songs were\nproduced by [Sam Phillips](/wiki/Sam_Phillips \"Sam Phillips\") and featured\n[Scotty Moore](/wiki/Scotty_Moore \"Scotty Moore\") on guitar and [Bill\nBlack](/wiki/Bill_Black \"Bill Black\") on bass.\n\nA year after Presley joined [RCA Victor](/wiki/RCA_Victor \"RCA Victor\"), he\nhad a spontaneous informal session with [Carl Perkins](/wiki/Carl_Perkins\n\"Carl Perkins\"), [Johnny Cash](/wiki/Johnny_Cash \"Johnny Cash\"), and [Jerry\nLee Lewis](/wiki/Jerry_Lee_Lewis \"Jerry Lee Lewis\") when visiting the Sun\nstudio. This meeting was recorded on December 4, 1956, and dubbed the [Million\nDollar Quartet](/wiki/Million_Dollar_Quartet \"Million Dollar Quartet\") by the\nlocal newspaper the next day. These sessions are not generally included when\nreference is made to \"Elvis's Sun Sessions\", however.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Recordings\n  * 2 The titles\n    * 2.1 My Happiness (self-financed demo)\n    * 2.2 That's When Your Heartaches Begin (self-financed demo)\n    * 2.3 I'll Never Stand In Your Way (self-financed demo)\n    * 2.4 It Wouldn't Be The Same Without You (self-financed demo)\n    * 2.5 I Love You Because\n    * 2.6 That's All Right\n    * 2.7 Harbor Lights\n    * 2.8 Blue Moon of Kentucky\n    * 2.9 Blue Moon\n    * 2.10 Tomorrow Night\n    * 2.11 I'll Never Let You Go (Little Darlin')\n    * 2.12 Satisfied\n    * 2.13 I Don't Care If The Sun Don't Shine\n    * 2.14 Just Because\n    * 2.15 Good Rockin' Tonight\n    * 2.16 Milkcow Blues Boogie\n    * 2.17 You're a Heartbreaker\n    * 2.18 Baby Let's Play House\n    * 2.19 I Got a Woman\n    * 2.20 Trying to Get to You\n    * 2.21 I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\n    * 2.22 I Forgot To Remember To Forget\n    * 2.23 Mystery Train\n    * 2.24 When It Rains, It Really Pours\n    * 2.25 The Million Dollar Quartet (session recordings)\n  * 3 Rumored/legendary recordings\n  * 4 Releases\n    * 4.1 Sun Singles\n    * 4.2 RCA Releases\n    * 4.3 Albums featuring the Sun recordings\n    * 4.4 _Elvis Presley_ (1956)\n    * 4.5 _For LP Fans Only (1958) and A Date with Elvis (1959)_\n    * 4.6 _Elvis for Everyone!_ (1965)\n    * 4.7 _The Sun Sessions_ (1976)\n    * 4.8 _The Complete Sun Sessions_ [33-track 2LP-set] / _The Sun Sessions_ [28-track CD] (1987)\n    * 4.9 _The Million Dollar Quartet_ (1989)\n    * 4.10 _The King of Rock 'n' Roll: The Complete 50s Masters_ (1992)\n    * 4.11 _Sunrise_ (1999)\n    * 4.12 _Elvis at Sun_ (2004)\n    * 4.13 _A Boy from Tupelo: The Complete 1953–55 Recordings_ (2012)\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_songs_recorded_by_Elvis_Presley_on_the_Sun_label&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n###\nRecordings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_songs_recorded_by_Elvis_Presley_on_the_Sun_label&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Recordings\")]\n\nOn July 18, 1953, Presley first went to the [Memphis Recording\nService](/wiki/Memphis_Recording_Service \"Memphis Recording Service\") at the\n[Sun Record Company](/wiki/Sun_Records \"Sun Records\"), now commonly known as\n[Sun Studio](/wiki/Sun_Records \"Sun Records\").[2] He paid $3.98 to record the\nfirst of two double-sided demo [acetates](/wiki/Cellulose_acetate \"Cellulose\nacetate\"), \"My Happiness\" and \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin.\" Presley\nreportedly gave the acetate to his mother as a much-belated extra birthday\npresent,[3] although many biographers suggest that Presley simply wanted to\nget noticed by Sun owner [Sam Phillips](/wiki/Sam_Phillips \"Sam Phillips\").\nThese suggestions are strengthened by the fact that the Presleys did not own a\nrecord player at the time.[4][5] That one-off acetate has since been valued at\n$500,000 by _[Record Collector](/wiki/Record_Collector \"Record Collector\")_\nmagazine. Returning to Sun Studios on January 4, 1954, he recorded a second\nacetate, \"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\"/\"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without\nYou.\"[6]\n\nPhillips had already cut the first records by blues artists such as [Howlin'\nWolf](/wiki/Howlin%27_Wolf \"Howlin' Wolf\") and [Junior\nParker](/wiki/Junior_Parker \"Junior Parker\").[7] He thought a combination of\nblack blues and [boogie-woogie](/wiki/Boogie-woogie \"Boogie-woogie\") music\nwould be very popular among white people, if presented in the right way.[8] In\nthe spring, Presley auditioned for an amateur gospel quartet called [The\nSongfellows](/w/index.php?title=The_Songfellows&action=edit&redlink=1 \"The\nSongfellows \\(page does not exist\\)\"), as one of the group was leaving and\nthey were seeking a replacement.[9] However, following Presley's audition, the\noriginal group member decided to stay.[9] In May, Presley auditioned at the\nHi-Hat in Memphis as a vocalist for a band. Eddie Bond, the owner of the Hi-\nHat, turned him down.[10]\n\nWhen Phillips acquired a demo recording of \"Without You\" and was unable to\nidentify the vocalist, his assistant, [Marion Keisker](/wiki/Marion_Keisker\n\"Marion Keisker\"), reminded him about the young truck driver. She called him\non May 26, 1954. Presley was not able to do justice to the song (the original\nacetate of the song that Phillips presented to Elvis resides in the Memphis\nState University collection),[11] but Phillips asked him to perform some of\nthe many other songs he knew. After running through a few songs, Presley\nexpressed an interest in finding a band to play with, and Phillips invited\nlocal [Western swing](/wiki/Western_swing \"Western swing\") musicians [Winfield\n\"Scotty\" Moore](/wiki/Scotty_Moore \"Scotty Moore\") (electric guitar) and [Bill\nBlack](/wiki/Bill_Black \"Bill Black\") (slap bass) to audition Presley. They\ndid so on Sunday, July 4, 1954, at Moore's house. Neither musician was overly\nimpressed, but they agreed a studio session would be useful to explore his\npotential.[12]\n\nOn July 5, 1954, the trio met at Sun studios to rehearse and record a handful\nof songs. According to Moore, the first song they recorded was \"I Love You\nBecause\", but, after a few other country-oriented songs that weren't all that\nimpressive, they decided to take a break.[13] During the break, Presley began\n\"acting the fool\" with Arthur Crudup's \"[That's All Right\n(Mama)](/wiki/That%27s_All_Right_\\(Mama\\) \"That's All Right \\(Mama\\)\")\", a\nblues song.[14] When the other two musicians joined in, Phillips got them to\nrestart and began taping. This was the bright, upbeat sound he had been\nlooking for.[15] Black remarked, \"Damn. Get that on the radio and they'll run\nus out of town.\"[16] The group recorded four songs during that session,\nincluding [bluegrass](/wiki/Bluegrass_music \"Bluegrass music\") musician [Bill\nMonroe](/wiki/Bill_Monroe \"Bill Monroe\")'s \"[Blue Moon of\nKentucky](/wiki/Blue_Moon_of_Kentucky \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\")\", which he had\nwritten and recorded as a slow [waltz](/wiki/Waltz_\\(music\\) \"Waltz\n\\(music\\)\"). Sources credit Bill Black with initiating the song, with Presley\nand Moore joining in. They ended up with a fast version of the song in 4/4\ntime. After an early take, Phillips can be heard on tape saying: \"Fine, man.\nHell, that's different—that's a pop song now, just about.\"[17]\n\nTo gauge professional and public reaction, Phillips took several acetates of\nthe session to [DJ](/wiki/DJ \"DJ\") [Dewey Phillips](/wiki/Dewey_Phillips\n\"Dewey Phillips\") (no relation) of Memphis radio station\n[WHBQ's](/wiki/WHBQ_\\(AM\\) \"WHBQ \\(AM\\)\") _Red, Hot And Blue_ show. \"That's\nAll Right\" subsequently received its first play on July 8, 1954.[18] A week\nlater, Sun had received some 6,000 advanced orders for \"That's All\nRight\"/\"Blue Moon of Kentucky,\" which was released on July 19, 1954. From\nAugust 18 through December 8, \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" was consistently higher\non the charts, and then both sides began to chart across the South.[19]\n\nAfter several performances with other bands, Presley arranged for Moore and\nBlack to be his regular back-up group, giving them each 25% of the\ntakings.[20] Moore and Black were originally members of their own band, The\nStarlight Wranglers, but after the success of \"That's All Right\", jealousy\nwithin the group forced them to split.[21]\n\nOver the next 15 months, the trio would release five singles, tour extensively\nacross the South, and appear regularly on the [Louisiana\nHayride](/wiki/Louisiana_Hayride \"Louisiana Hayride\"); it was the biggest\nrival to the [Grand Ole Opry](/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry \"Grand Ole Opry\") at the\ntime. They had originally auditioned for the Opry in October 1954, but they\nfailed to impress the people in charge, or the audience, and were not invited\nback. Several biographers cite Jim Denny, talent agent at the Opry, as the man\nwho told Presley that he should \"go back to driving a truck\".[22]\n\nThe trio would record at Sun together until November 1955, when Phillips sold\nPresley's contract to RCA Victor for $40,000; it was, at the time, the highest\nsum ever paid for a recording contract. Sun had permission to keep pressing\nthe singles until January 1, 1956, and RCA Victor released Presley's first\nfive Sun singles nationally. In January 1956, Presley recorded \"Heartbreak\nHotel\", his first RCA Victor single. He would return to Sun studios regularly\nover the next few months, visiting with Phillips and meeting many of the\nlabel's new artists.\n\nAlthough Presley never officially recorded for Sun again, he was caught on\ntape during an impromptu jamming session on December 4, 1956. Presley had\narrived during a Carl Perkins recording session, which also featured a young\nJerry Lee Lewis on piano, and a new artist named Johnny Cash watching on.\nDuring a break in recording, Presley sat at the piano and began to sing along\nwith Perkins, Lewis and Cash. Phillips kept his tape recorder running, and,\nseeing an opportunity to promote another of his new acts, he arranged for a\nreporter to cover the event. The recordings would eventually be known as \"The\nMillion Dollar Quartet\".\n\nDuring Presley's tenure at Sun Records, he recorded two demo recordings in\nLubbock, Texas: \"Fool, Fool, Fool\" and \"[Shake, Rattle and\nRoll](/wiki/Shake,_Rattle_and_Roll \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\")\", which were\nreleased for the first time by RCA in the 1990s. These are not considered Sun\nrecordings.\n\n## The\ntitles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_songs_recorded_by_Elvis_Presley_on_the_Sun_label&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: The titles\")]\n\nListed are the 24 titles from 1953–55, in order of their _recording date_ ,\nfollowed by the 1956 recordings known as \"The Million Dollar Quartet\".

According to Carr and Farren, RCA planned to include this recording on the 1965 compilation album _[Elvis for Everyone](/wiki/Elvis_for_Everyone \"Elvis for Everyone\")_ , but substituted the Sun side \"Tomorrow Night\" instead.[38]\n  * \"Uncle Penn\" (1 take recorded Sept. 9, 1954). Carr and Farren claim the existence of \"Uncle Penn\" is proven by it being listed on the session sheet for the recording session of December 8, 1954 that produced \"Tomorrow Night\"[39] however this contradicts the authors' chart that gives the Sept. 9 recording date.[40]\n  * \"[Oakie Boogie](/wiki/Oakie_Boogie \"Oakie Boogie\")\" (1 take recorded Dec. 8, 1954)\n\n##\nReleases[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_songs_recorded_by_Elvis_Presley_on_the_Sun_label&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Releases\")]\n\nMost of the tapes, including the private single, the Million Dollar Quartet\nand alternate takes have been released.\n\n### Sun\nSingles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_songs_recorded_by_Elvis_Presley_on_the_Sun_label&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Sun Singles\")]\n\nTen songs, making five singles, were originally released on the Sun label.\nThese records (in both 45 RPM and 78 RPM formats) are among the most valuable\nof Elvis' output, fetching four figures in excellent condition:\n\n  * Sun 209—July 19, 1954: That's All Right / Blue Moon of Kentucky\n  * Sun 210—September 25, 1954: Good Rockin' Tonight / I Don't Care If The Sun Don't Shine\n  * Sun 215—December 28, 1954: Milkcow Blues Boogie / You're A Heartbreaker\n  * Sun 217—April 10, 1955: Baby Let's Play House / I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\n  * Sun 223—August 6, 1955: I Forgot To Remember To Forget / Mystery Train\n\n### RCA\nReleases[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_songs_recorded_by_Elvis_Presley_on_the_Sun_label&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: RCA Releases\")]\n\nAfter signing with RCA, the same songs, in the same b/w combination, were re-\nreleased by RCA.
