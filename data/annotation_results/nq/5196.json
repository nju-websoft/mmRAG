Morgan, for a\n31-city [war bond](/wiki/War_bond \"War bond\") tour. Morgan's original co-pilot\nwas Capt. James A. Verinis, who himself piloted the _Memphis Belle_ for one\nmission. Verinis was promoted to aircraft commander of another B-17 for his\nfinal 16 missions and finished his tour on 13 May. He rejoined Morgan's crew\nas co-pilot for the flight back to the United States.\n\nThe B-17 _Hell 's Angels_ (41-24577) of the 303rd Bomb Group completed 25\ncombat missions on 13 May 1943, becoming the first B-17 to complete the feat,\none week before the _Memphis Belle_.[19][20]\n\n## Source of the\nname[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memphis_Belle_\\(aircraft\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Source of the name\")]\n\nThe aircraft was named after pilot Robert K Morgan's sweetheart, Margaret\nPolk, a resident of [Memphis, Tennessee](/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee \"Memphis,\nTennessee\").

Station and crew names\nwere stenciled below station windows on the aircraft after her tour of duty\nwas completed.\n\n## Postwar\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memphis_Belle_\\(aircraft\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Postwar history\")]\n\nIn his memoirs, Morgan claimed that during his publicity tour he flew the B-17\nbetween the [Buncombe County](/wiki/Buncombe_County \"Buncombe County\")\nCourthouse and the City Hall of [Asheville, North\nCarolina](/wiki/Asheville,_North_Carolina \"Asheville, North Carolina\"), his\nhome town.

When he\nobserved the courthouse and the city hall (two tall buildings that are only\nabout 50 ft (20 m) apart) dead ahead, he lowered his left wing in a 60 degree\nbank and flew between the structures.

The city of Memphis bought\nthe B-17 for US$350 (equivalent to $4,758 in 2017).[24][25] She was flown to\nMemphis in July 1946 and stored until the summer of 1949 when she was placed\non display at the [National Guard](/wiki/United_States_National_Guard \"United\nStates National Guard\") armory near the city's fairgrounds. She sat out-of-\ndoors into the 1980s, slowly deteriorating from weather and\n[vandalism](/wiki/Vandalism \"Vandalism\"). Souvenir hunters removed almost all\nof the interior components. Eventually no instruments were left in the\ncockpit, and virtually every removable piece of the aircraft's interior had\nbeen scavenged, often severing the aircraft's wiring and control cables in the\nprocess.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Memphis_Bell_on_War_Bond_tour_at_Patterson_Field.jpg/220px-\nMemphis_Bell_on_War_Bond_tour_at_Patterson_Field.jpg)](/wiki/File:Memphis_Bell_on_War_Bond_tour_at_Patterson_Field.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Memphis_Bell_on_War_Bond_tour_at_Patterson_Field.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe _Memphis Belle_ on a [War Bond](/wiki/War_Bond \"War Bond\") campaign at\n[Patterson Field](/wiki/Wright-Patterson_Air_Force_Base \"Wright-Patterson Air\nForce Base\") during World War II.\n\nIn the early 1970s, another mayor had donated the historic aircraft back to\nthe Air Force, but they allowed her to remain in\n[Memphis](/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee \"Memphis, Tennessee\") contingent on her\nbeing maintained. Efforts by the locally organized _Memphis Belle_ Memorial\nAssociation, Inc. (MBMA) saw the aircraft moved to [Mud\nIsland](/wiki/Mud_Island,_Memphis \"Mud Island, Memphis\") in the [Mississippi\nRiver](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\") in 1987 for display in a\nnew pavilion with large tarp cover.[25] She was still open to the elements,\nhowever, and prone to weathering. Pigeons would also nest inside the tarp and\ndroppings were constantly needing removal from the B-17. Dissatisfaction with\nthe site led to efforts to create a new museum facility in [Shelby\nCounty](/wiki/Shelby_County,_Tennessee \"Shelby County, Tennessee\"). In the\nsummer of 2003 the _Belle_ was disassembled and moved to a restoration\nfacility at the former [Naval Air Station\nMemphis](/wiki/Naval_Air_Station_Memphis \"Naval Air Station Memphis\") in\n[Millington, Tennessee](/wiki/Millington,_Tennessee \"Millington, Tennessee\")\nfor work.

The _Belle_ arrived safely at the museum in mid-\nOctober 2005 and was placed in one of the Museum's restoration hangars.\n\nThe Museum placed restoration of _Memphis Belle_ near the top of its\npriorities. In the magazine _Friends Journal_ of the museum's foundation,\nMajor General [Charles D. Metcalf](/wiki/Charles_D._Metcalf \"Charles D.\nMetcalf\"), USAF (Ret), then the director of the museum, stated that it might\ntake eight to 10 years to fully restore the aircraft.\n\nBy the spring of 2009, considerable preparatory work had been accomplished,\nbut the fuselage and wings were still disassembled.[26]\n\nAfter stripping the paint from the aft fuselage of the aircraft, hundreds of\nnames and personal messages were found scratched in the aluminum skin. It\nturned out that, during the aircraft's war bond tour, people were allowed to\nleave their mark there.\n\nIn May 2017 the museum announced the goal of completing the restoration and\nputting the _Memphis Belle_ on display by May 17, 2018, the 75th anniversary\nof the plane's 25th mission.[27] On March 19, 2018 the _Memphis Belle_ was\nmoved into the WWII Gallery at the National Museum of the United States Air\nForce, and was officially unveiled May 17, 2018.[4]\n\n## _Memphis Belle_ film\n(1990)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memphis_Belle_\\(aircraft\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Memphis Belle film \\(1990\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Memphis Belle (film)](/wiki/Memphis_Belle_\\(film\\) \"Memphis\nBelle \\(film\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Memphisbellenose.jpg/220px-\nMemphisbellenose.jpg)](/wiki/File:Memphisbellenose.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Memphisbellenose.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe B-17 that portrayed _Memphis Belle_ in the 1990 film at the Joint Service\nOpen House at Andrews Air Force Base in 2008.\n\nFive airworthy B-17s were used in the filming of the 1990 British-American war\ndrama film _[Memphis Belle](/wiki/Memphis_Belle_\\(film\\) \"Memphis Belle\n\\(film\\)\")_ , two from the US (N-17W – now on display in Seattle and _Movie\nMemphis Belle_ 44-83546), B-17G _[Sally B](/wiki/Sally_B \"Sally B\")_ from the\nUK and two French geographic survey B-17Gs, one of which crashed on take-off\nnear the end of filming.\n\nThe B-17Gs had some sections converted into a B-17F configuration for the\nfilm. A former civilian firebomber, B-17G-85-DL, AAC Serial No. 44-83546, FAA\nregistered N3703G, was converted by installing a Sperry top turret, early-\nstyle tail gunner's compartment and waist gunner's positions, and omitting the\nchin turret.
