When Amy wakes up, she's in the hospital and discovers that her\nmother died in the accident. Amy's sister Lou comes home from New York City to\nhelp. Refusing to put Spartan down, Grandpa Jack brings the horse back to\nHeartland hoping that Amy can help him. Before Amy can help Spartan, she has\nto come to terms with what happened to her mom.

Ben Stillman is sent to live at Heartland\nby his aunt, Lisa, while she's in France. No one likes Ben, as he uses methods\nlike whipping his horse, Red, to show him \"who's boss\", and he doesn't\nparticipate in ranch duties. Ty is especially angry, challenging Amy to prove\nthat Heartland is different than the other stables (like Briar Ridge) that\ntolerate this treatment of horses. Amy gets knocked off her horse while trying\nto take Ben's horse across the river on a trail ride and sustains a minor head\ninjury. Ty is offered a job at Briar Ridge even after Amy accidentally tells\nAshley that Ty is on probation. When Amy hears that Ty might take the job, she\nsnaps at him.

She\nmanages to cause her fair share of trouble in the process, ripping off Soraya\nand stealing from Ashley, as well as creating friction with the Heartland\nfamily.

This fear stems from\nhaving witnessed his accident at the Calgary Stampede years before. Tim also\nbrings Amy a roping horse with a fear of cattle for her to heal. Jack escapes\nfrom the family reunion by going on a second date with Lisa. Ty practises his\ncattle roping skills, but discovers he still has a lot to learn about cows.\nLou blows up at Tim after he forces her to jump Spartan and pushes Amy working\nhis horse until she gets hurt.  \n12 | 12 | \"Rising From Ashes\" | Don McBrearty | Heather Conkie | February 17, 2008 (2008-02-17) | 112  \nA sudden, yet deliberate, barn fire puts Jack in hospital and Heartland in\nfinancial straits, just as Lou was preparing to return to her old life in New\nYork.

Looking to expand neighbouring ranch Briar\nRidge, Val makes an offer to buy some of Jack's land, but Tim isn't so keen on\nthe idea.

There\nis a new ranch hand, a cowboy named Caleb O'Dell, who came with his roping\nhorse, Shorty. At the start of the episode, Amy watches as two wild stallions\nfight for control of a herd, and takes the losing wild stallion back to\nHeartland to treat his injuries and tame him. Lou has plans to create a\n\"corporate equine retreat\" at Heartland, which Jack rejects as being a \"dude\nranch\". She makes an effort to talk him around. At Amy's surprise sweet-\nsixteen party, Jack gets a call from someone and leaves the party. [George\nCanyon](/wiki/George_Canyon \"George Canyon\"), the country singer, makes a\ncameo as Mallory's dad Charlie and sings his hit song \"Just Like You\" at Amy's\nparty. The episode ends with Jack and Ty getting out of the truck, to a less-\nthan-warm welcome from Amy.  \n15 | 2 | \"Letting Go\" | TW Peacocke | Leila Basen and David Preston | October 12, 2008 (2008-10-12) | 202  \nAfter his return, Ty promptly clashes with Caleb, as the latter has stepped\ninto most of Ty's former duties. Caleb begins to emerge as a romantic rival to\nTy for Amy, although Ashley is clearly interested in Caleb as well.

Jack agrees\nto Lou renovating, rather than replacing, the old cabins for her corporate\nequine retreat. As a birthday present, Tim gives Amy a show jumping horse\nnamed Storm, and she is elated to receive such a gift.  \n16 | 3 | \"Gift Horse\" | Ron Murphy | Leila Basen and David Preston | October 19, 2008 (2008-10-19) | 203  \nAmy tries to balance school, chores, and training for show jumping. Her father\nhelps to coach her and Ty offers to help with chores and training Spartan, but\nAmy is struggling. Her grades in Earth Science slip while she tries to keep up\nwith a show circuit that has competitions every weekend. (It should be noted\nthat Earth Sciences is not actually a course offered in Alberta - parts of\ngeological science are included in various other science courses in the\nprovince.[3] This is one of a limited number of regional errors in this show.)\nAmy is forced to choose between her love of healing troubled horses and living\nup to her father's show jumping expectations. With no way to balance it all,\nAmy makes the hard decision to quit show jumping and sell Storm. This allows\nher to focus on her grades, chores, and work with horses. Meanwhile, Lou is\nsearching for dude ranch horses and she is at odds with Tim over which horses\nto buy. He knows someone with [Quarter Horses](/wiki/Quarter_Horses \"Quarter\nHorses\") to sell, but Jack explains that they are hard for beginners to handle\neffectively. Amy suggests looking at rescue horses, and Scott helps Lou choose\ngentle, reliable horses for the dude ranch.  \n17 | 4 | \"Dancing in the Dark\" | Ron Murphy | Heather Conkie | October 26, 2008 (2008-10-26) | 204  \nMost of the family go away on the spring cattle drive, as Ray Phillips, the\nowner of Big River Ranch, had just passed away and a herd of cattle was part\nof his estate. Lou pushes them out the door as fast as possible, as she has\nplanned a romantic weekend at the ranch with Scott. Their plans change because\nScott happens to be on call, and the dude ranch's first customers arrive a\nweek early: an odd middle-aged couple who are travel bloggers, and Lou goes\nout of her way to please them, thinking that their reviews could make or break\nher new venture. Lucky for Lou, they don't hold a grudge; she backed into\ntheir car after having lunch with Marnie at Maggie's, before they got to the\nranch. While on the cattle drive, Amy and Ty talk for the first time about his\nabsence and clear the air between them. Ty comes close to telling Amy how he\nfeels, and they kiss. Lisa tells Jack that she loves him, and they kiss too.\nTim buys Big River Ranch and the infamous [longhorns](/wiki/Texas_longhorn\n\"Texas longhorn\"), and finds himself attracted to Ray's daughter Callie. Ty\nand Caleb get in a fight and accidentally release a group of cattle, who are\neasily returned to their pen with everyone's help. Mallory is still trying to\nconvince Jake to stop pursuing her, but ends up dancing with him. Lou and\nScott realize that their relationship isn't working due to conflicting\nschedules. Scott suggests a break, while Lou suggests marriage, leaving them\non an unclear footing for the near future.  \n18 | 5 | \"Corporate Cowgirls\" | [Tim Southam](/wiki/Tim_Southam \"Tim Southam\") | Heather Conkie | November 2, 2008 (2008-11-02) | 205  \nLou puts a brave face on lingering insecurities when former coworkers from the\nhigh-powered career she gave up in New York become customers at her corporate\nequine retreat. Caleb bails on leading the trail ride because it would have\nmeant Amy and Ty could have a romantic evening alone at the ranch. Amy helps\nLou instead and takes Copper, who is a better trail horse, despite Mallory's\nprotests. When Amy is gone, Mallory does a bit of jumping on Spartan, then\ntakes him on a ride. While checking a log on the trail to make sure it's safe\nto jump, Mallory doesn't notice Spartan leave. She finds him grazing at the\nside of the road relatively quickly, but doesn't notice the signs indicating\nrecent pesticide application. Once they return to the ranch, it becomes\nevident something is wrong, which Ty correctly guesses to be pesticide\npoisoning. Ty looks into Marion's notebooks, and gets Mallory's help to mix\ncharcoal and water. Caleb and his friend Kit, who Ty met accidentally while\nshe was bathing in the pond early that morning, show up. Ty explains the\nsituation, and they get Spartan to drink all the jugs of charcoal water\ntogether. Meanwhile, Lou's friends work out their problems with each other,\nthemselves, and their love lives, on the overnight trip that Lou, Tim, Amy,\nand Jack took them on. Lou's friend Lauren kisses Tim, who pushes her away,\nand Lou becomes upset with her friend. Lou admits Scott said no to her\nproposal because he wasn't sure, and that she doesn't know how they stand now.\nAt the end of the trip, Lou feels bad for the fight that happened among the\ngirls the previous night and tries to apologize, but the girls say it was\ntherapeutic, and they will be sure to spread the word in New York about the\nHeartland Equestrian Connection.  \n19 | 6 | \"Holding Fast\" | Tim Southam | [Susin Nielsen](/wiki/Susin_Nielsen \"Susin Nielsen\") | November 9, 2008 (2008-11-09) | 206  \nOut for a ride along the river, Amy comes across an RCMP officer trying to\nsave a young boy from drowning. She tries to help his horse, Venture, who has\ndeveloped a fear of water. She discovers the connection to the trauma of\nConstable Rodriguez's brother drowning six years earlier, for which he still\nfeels responsible, and ends up helping both the horse and the officer. Lou\ngoes to a polo match for Nick Harwell's polo team, as he gave her a number of\nfree tickets, and upsets Scott when Nick talks about hiring him and Lou\npraises his work. Scott and Lou talk about the state of their relationship,\nand they break up for real. Lisa tries to convince Jack to go to the polo\nmatch with her, but he refuses. She even goes to the trouble of getting him a\nnew suit so he won't stand out, but he still refuses. But he shows up just as\nthe match starts and apologizes to Lisa for being so stubborn. Ashley takes\nCaleb to the polo club with her and shares her new pursuit of barrel racing\n(which Kit is teaching her) with her mother's friends, much to Val's chagrin.\nTy asks Amy out on a date, but she already has plans with Caleb. Mallory tries\nto get rid of Jake, using lame excuses to avoid seeing him and ignoring his\nphone calls. Jack facilitates an honest conversation between the two,\nfrustrated with their beating around the bush and hoping to get some peace.\nThey walk off together, with Mallory reiterating that she is not a [\"buckle\nbunny\"](/wiki/Groupie#Sports \"Groupie\").  \n20 | 7 | \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\" | Steve DiMarco | Leila Basen and David Preston | November 16, 2008 (2008-11-16) | 207  \nWith the annual Hudson Heritage [Rodeo](/wiki/Rodeo \"Rodeo\") looming, everyone\nat Heartland gets roped into the action and intrigue of broncs, bulls, beer,\nbeauty queens, and belt buckles. Amy and Caleb compete in [team\nroping](/wiki/Rodeo#roping \"Rodeo\") and he also competes in [bronc\nriding](/wiki/Rodeo#.22Rough_stock.22_competition \"Rodeo\"), earning him the\n[all-around cowboy](/wiki/All-around_cowboy \"All-around cowboy\") buckle at the\nrodeo. Soraya, Lou, Ashley, and Kit compete for the title [Queen of the\nRodeo](/wiki/Rodeo_queen \"Rodeo queen\"). Kit wins, Soraya is runner-up, and\nAshley is second runner-up. Ty competes in [bull\nriding](/wiki/Rodeo#.22Rough_stock.22_competition \"Rodeo\") when someone who\nwas entered doesn't show up, and Amy becomes upset, concerned for his safety,\nas bull riding seems to be perceived as the most dangerous event. Amy seems\nconcerned over Ty and Kit's budding friendship. Ashley is noticeably upset at\nthe party that follows the rodeo and is drinking quite heavily, and Amy learns\nfrom her that Apollo, Ashley's show jumping horse and the only horse that she\nhad a bond with, has been sold. By the end of the night, Ashley is too\nintoxicated to take herself home, so Amy drives. She takes her eyes off the\nroad and swerves, then Ashley yanks the wheel and they go off the road. Ty and\nKit are headed home in his truck, and they help the girls. The next morning,\nTy takes the blame for the accident, as Ashley was drunk and Amy has only a\nClass 7 license (learner's permit), as she hasn't taken the basic road test to\nearn her Class 5 Probationary license yet. Ashley goes home with her mother,\nwho is angry over the $3700 in damages to Ashley's BMW.  \n21 | 8 | \"Summer's End\" | [Don McBrearty](/wiki/Don_McBrearty \"Don McBrearty\") | Heather Conkie | November 29, 2008 (2008-11-29) | 208  \nIt's the end of summer in Hudson, and the weather is sweltering. While most of\nthe family are awake because of the heat, Brad Borden (Ty's father) comes to\nHeartland with six horses in a livestock trailer designed for cattle. One of\nthe horses is down on the floor with a bad head wound, and Jack is forced to\ndo the merciful thing, though Amy is desperate to prevent it. The other five\nhorses are badly dehydrated and in rough shape, but able to wait until\nmorning, when Scott can get to Heartland from Red Deer. Amy has a feeling that\nshe knows one of the horses, and after cleaning his face, realizes that it is\nAshley's former jumper, Apollo. When Amy calls Ashley, she is distraught\nthinking that her mother sold Apollo to a meat truck. In fairness, Val thought\nthat the horse dealer she sold to was reputable. Ashley smashes the windows of\nVal's SUV with a golf club and runs away from home, despite Val's threats to\ncut her off financially. Ashley spends much of the episode working and living\nat the dude ranch, and considering dropping out of high school. Ty is upset\nwith his father for leaving him alone in Calgary, resulting in the men Brad\nowed money to tracking Ty down and beating him up several times. Father and\nson spend some time talking and they make peace, even talking about taking a\ntrip to the Grand Canyon together. Amy, Ty, Caleb, and Mallory care for the\nhorses, and this heavy episode is lightened by Mallory's efforts to stay cool,\nstanding in front of the open fridge and taking a cool bath with several bags\nof ice. There's even a lighthearted water fight while the four of them are\nwashing down the horses one evening. Amy and Ty are getting closer to where\nthey left things before Ty went to Calgary. When the rain finally comes and\ncools off the heat, they go outside and kiss, but Ty breaks it off, worrying\nhe is like his dad and saying he doesn't want to hurt Amy. Once the horses are\ncared for, Lou deals with the logistics by making a deal with their owner (a\nhorse dealer) to buy the five healthy horses for $2000. However, Brad takes\nthe money and leaves abruptly in the middle of the night, after receiving a\ncall from the men that are still expecting his to return their money.\nConstable Rodriguez comes to the rescue when it looks like the horses will\nhave to go back to the dealer, and the family keep the horses to use on trail\nrides for the dude ranch.  \n22 | 9 | \"Showdown!\" | [Sudz Sutherland](/wiki/Sudz_Sutherland \"Sudz Sutherland\") | Leila Basen and David Preston | December 7, 2008 (2008-12-07) | 209  \nAmy and Soraya return to school, and Amy makes a bunch of schedules so that\nCaleb and Ty will do most of the work, and she won't have to fall behind in\nher studies this year. However, there have been some mysterious [cattle\nrustlers](/wiki/Cattle_raiding \"Cattle raiding\") roaming about stealing many\nranchers' cows and the ranchers are getting worried. Tim is one such rancher,\nand he hires both Caleb and Ty to watch his herd. This angers Amy, as she\nknows they won't have enough time to do most of the regular chores at the\nranch as well. When she expresses this anger to Caleb, he kisses her and tells\nher that she thinks too much. The next day, Ty and Kit are having fun while\nworking on schoolwork in the back of his truck, and they kiss. By this time,\nthey had become close, and she had helped Ty apply to take online courses to\ncomplete his high-school diploma. Mallory discovered at the start of the\nepisode that her parents had important news that could only be shared face-to-\nface. Her father has a gold record, and is going on tour to promote it. Since\nthey can't be around to take care of her, Mallory is to be sent to Blessed\nVirgin Academy, an all-girls boarding school. There is a touching moment as\nshe leaves the ranch. The tension continues to increase in this episode, as\nthe ranchers become more and more concerned about their cattle. The police try\nto help track the rustlers, but they work swiftly, observing herds from a\nhelicopter, then cutting fence lines and rounding up the cattle, driving them\ninto a livestock trailer and escaping. Lou feels torn, as she has started\nseeing Mark Rodriguez, to whom her father is becoming increasingly hostile,\nfeeling that the constable is inept at his job of preventing livestock theft.\nThe episode reaches its climax when Ty and Caleb watch as the cattle rustlers\nturn up to steal Tim's herd of cattle. Amy rides off in search of the ranch\nhands when she finds no work completed in the barn, and comes across the same\nscene, but one of the rustlers causes Spartan to rear, dropping Amy to the\nground. Ty and Caleb come to help her, and she manages to escape, but the\nrustler has a gun and they stop advancing towards the scene of the crime. Jack\ndrives up with Tim in tow, tipped off by Ashley, and try to stop the rustlers,\nbut they are outnumbered. Amy sees this, and comes running towards them,\ncalling, \"Dad!\" The rustlers turn, guns in hand, and shoot towards her; Tim\ntakes a bullet to protect Amy. The episode ends on a cliffhanger, with no\nindication of where the bullet got Tim or whether he will survive, and the\ncattle rustlers drive off with his entire herd (minus the two longhorns).  \n23 | 10 | \"True Enough\" | Sudz Sutherland | Heather Conkie | January 4, 2009 (2009-01-04) | 210  \nThe episode prolongs the cliffhanger as long as possible, not referring to\nwhat happened to Tim, showing an influx of food from friends of the family\n(which usually corresponds with a funeral) and a conversation between Lou and\nJack about Amy, saying that it's good she went on a ride. She is even seen\nriding past the cemetery where her mom was buried in the first episode. Tim\nturns out to have been injured in his right shoulder, and he is wearing a\nsling. Tim becomes a source of tension in the household, constantly ringing a\nbell and expecting to be served. Amy is feeling guilty for being the cause of\nhis bullet wound (although indirectly), and she heals while caring for another\nhorse. Amy's teacher, Ruth Adams, is trying to sell her father's old chestnut,\nBoxer. Amy and Ty try to help him settle in while they work on rehoming him,\nby bringing Hank Adams to visit his horse. While he is there, Ruth shows up,\nvery upset that her father was brought to the ranch, revealing that Hank has\nAlzheimer's. Despite being fuzzy about who his daughter is, Hank clearly\nremembers Boxer and even Jack. Jack eventually remembers that Hank was the\nlead guitarist for his wife, Lyndy, when she was a singer professionally. Jack\nhad brought out an old record of hers to listen to, and they listen to it\nwhile talking with the Adams. Hank spontaneously picks up a guitar and starts\nplaying the song in time with the record. In the end, Amy offers to keep Boxer\nso that Hank can visit him while he is able, and Ruth accepts this offer.\nWhile Tim is wearing out his welcome with Jack, Callie Phillips shows up and\nstarts taking care of Tim. It seems they have been seeing each other since the\ncattle drive earlier in the season, and she stays at Big River whenever she is\nin town. This is quite a shock to the girls, who had no idea that Tim had a\ngirlfriend. Amy is the least comfortable with it, and is fairly rude to Callie\nwhile she stays with them overnight. In the meantime, Lou is still seeing\nMark, and enjoying it, even making him a mixed CD of police-related songs\n(whether by theme or artists' name). However, they were supposed to take a\ntrip to the [Banff Springs Hotel](/wiki/Banff_Springs_Hotel \"Banff Springs\nHotel\") and have lunch there, but Mark says he is busy going to a provincial\nreview meeting in Edmonton. This turns out to be a lie when Lou sees him\nkissing a blonde in Hudson, in his truck. He tries to explain that he didn't\nthink they were exclusive, but Lou dumps him without a second thought. Ty is\non a date with Kit, and Caleb tells Amy that Ty gave her up too easily. Caleb\nthen shares a kiss with an enthusiastic Amy. Callie and Tim get in a fight,\nbut get back together, and she takes him back to Big River, and finally out of\nJack's hair.  \n24 | 11 | \"Starstruck!\" | Dean Bennett | Leila Basen and David Preston | January 11, 2009 (2009-01-11) | 211  \nHollywood starlet and gossip-rag fodder Mindy Fanshaw arrives at Heartland\nunder the pretext of honing her riding skills, which turn out to be non-\nexistent. Mallory is found hiding in one of the dude ranch cabins, having been\naided in her 'escape' from the boarding school by Jake. Mallory collects items\nMindy has used around Heartland, planning to sell them on eBay so she can\nrepay Jake for the money he spent helping her. Mindy digs into the\nTy/Amy/Caleb 'triangle', lying to all three about what the others had said and\nattempts to pit the three against each other. She attacks Amy in particular\nfor being unable to choose between Ty and Caleb or express how she feels about\neither guy. When Mindy ropes Caleb into taking her on a trail ride, she\ninsists on riding an ailing Pegasus, ignoring Amy's warning that the horse\nshould not be used. This results in a calculated photo-op for Mindy with\npaparazzi tipped off by her agent. The photographers get too close and spook\nPegasus, dropping Mindy off his back, but causing stone bruises and a chipped\nbone for Pegasus. Lou eventually kicks Mindy out for behaving as a spoiled\nrich girl and disrupting the peace at Heartland, and she drives off into the\nsunset. She does leave Amy a parting gift, in the form of a very flashy, one\nof a kind belt, which was for sale at Maggie's for $995. Amy promptly gives\nthis to Soraya, with whom she was fighting over Amy's not sharing that Mindy\nwas taking riding lessons at Heartland.  \n25 | 12 | \"Divorce Horse\" | Dean Bennett | Heather Conkie | January 18, 2009 (2009-01-18) | 212  \nMackenzie Hutton returns to Heartland with a fiancé, Ian, who she met after\ndumping her real estate agent boyfriend in New York. Mackenzie has changed\nquite a bit from her last visit to Heartland. She has given up the pretense of\nallergies to gluten, dairy, sugar, food that is not certified organic, and\ncaffeine. She is also much more relaxed and happy with her easygoing husband-\nto-be in the picture. She has also taken a page from Lou's book and quit her\njob to be her own boss, running a little art gallery in [the\nVillage](/wiki/Greenwich_Village \"Greenwich Village\"). When Mackenzie arrives\nat Heartland, she is talking about a small wedding (under 50 guests) held\noutside near the dude ranch, with a BBQ cookout reception. Lisa (with the best\nof intentions) meddles with Lou's plans for Mackenzie, since she knows the\nHuttons and their high-society lifestyle. Lisa and Mackenzie's mom convince\nher that she would be happier with a sit-down reception dinner and a tent and\nroses and peonies for table settings, rather than what she and Ian had been\nhoping for. Lisa also meddles in Lou's personal life, giving her email to a\nfriend, who passed it on to another friend's single son. Peter, the young man,\nemails Lou, but she has to decide if she wants to respond. In the meantime,\nAmy has been treating another horse for Lisa, an\n[Andalusian](/wiki/Andalusian_horse \"Andalusian horse\") beauty named Diva.\nLisa claims the horse is cursed, calling her \"Diva girl, the divorce horse\",\nas everyone who has owned the horse has become divorced. She is moody and\ntemperamental, and Lisa asks Amy to figure her out, since Diva has been\nreturned three times after being rehomed. With Ty and Caleb's help, Amy\ndetermines that Diva just needs to be a horse, and hates to be kept in a\nstall. Unfortunately, this means that Lisa cannot sell her as a show horse.\nShe ultimately decides to give Diva to Mackenzie, who had taken a real shine\nto her, and would be able to keep her at her inlaws' ranch in Montana. While\nMackenzie and Ian had been fighting during the episode over whether to even\nget married after their plans were hijacked, they resolve their differences\nand remember how much they love one another. The episode ends with Mackenzie\nand Ian saying their vows in the company of the Heartland family, at sunset in\nfront of the dude ranch cabins and overlooking the pond.  \n26 | 13 | \"Seismic Shifts\" | TW Peacocke | Susin Nielsen | February 8, 2009 (2009-02-08) | 213  \nBedford Oil comes to Hudson and begins to conduct [oil\nexploration](/wiki/Hydrocarbon_exploration \"Hydrocarbon exploration\") on\nJack's property, using [seismic\ntesting](/wiki/Reflection_seismology#Hydrocarbon_exploration \"Reflection\nseismology\") and exploratory oil wells. Mallory tells Lou that there is little\nto be done, as the oil companies can do as they please. Feeling shocked by the\ninjustice of it, Lou mobilizes the community against Bedford. She holds a town\nhall meeting where she invites local community members, their\n[MLA](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Alberta \"Legislative Assembly of\nAlberta\"), and a representative from Bedford Oil, who shows up and turns out\nto be PW (Peter Walter) Morris, the company owner. Tim shares a contrasting\nperspective with Lou privately, saying that he would be glad to have a well\ninstalled on his property, for the royalties he would be paid. Mallory is\nreading [Wuthering Heights](/wiki/Wuthering_Heights \"Wuthering Heights\") and\nbecomes convinced that Amy and Ty are Catherine and Heathcliff, meant to be\ntogether but thwarted by circumstance. Amy is working on desensitizing a horse\nnamed Acorn to noise and struggles to make progress with the oil company\nblasting at the edge of Jack's land. Ashley and Caleb become roommates, as\nAshley leaves Briar Ridge again after fighting with her mother. Mallory\ndiscovers that the two fishermen staying at the dude ranch are actually\nworking for the oil company, when she is cleaning their cabin and discovers\ntheir fishing gear left behind. Lou kicks them out, though they protest that\nthey had paid for several days more. Lou continues to hold a grudge against\nLisa and avoid her company, though she continues to instant message with the\nman that Lisa gave Lou's email to. By the end of the episode, Lisa apologizes\nto Lou and they have an honest conversation, making up in the process. Lou\nmeets PW in town twice, spilling coffee on his shirt both times. He seems\nsomewhat interested in her, but she shuts him down. Lou agrees to meet\n\"Internet guy\" as Mallory has dubbed him, who turns out to be none other than\nPW. Neither one of them were able to make the connection, though, as both used\ntheir first names - Peter and Samantha. Lou lets practical considerations (the\nfact that Peter is \"an oil guy\") get in the way of having a relationship (or\neven a date) with Peter. Nonetheless, they wind up kissing on the street in\nfront of Maggie's. Lou starts to leave, returns to kiss him again, and then\nsays that their attraction cannot go anywhere, ending the episode on a small\ncliffhanger.  \n27 | 14 | \"Do or Die\" | TW Peacocke | Mark Haroun | February 15, 2009 (2009-02-15) | 214  \nTy's former probation officer, Clint, brings two troubled kids to the ranch,\nhoping that they can learn something from Ty and the ranch where he sorted out\nhis problems. The two kids, Tara and Badger, seem to be at the far end of the\nspectrum relative to Ty, starting off their stay by burning an [Adirondack\nchair](/wiki/Adirondack_chair \"Adirondack chair\") at the dude ranch and\nputting peanut butter in the muffin Clint was eating -- knowing he was\nallergic to peanuts. Tara is a [goth](/wiki/Goth_subculture \"Goth\nsubculture\"), and Badger is a boy who never talks. They clash with most of the\nfamily, and especially Mallory. Tara teases her by calling her a cheerleader,\n[Hilary Duff](/wiki/Hilary_Duff \"Hilary Duff\"), and similar names that reflect\nher perception of Mallory as a peppy \"nice girl\". Ty and Badger fight from the\nbeginning, when he refuses to put out his cigarette and later lets all of the\nhorses in the barn out. Tara follows Ty around a bit, making reference to them\nbeing alike, thinking she knows his experiences. Mallory eventually makes\npeace with Tara by sharing her own story about her parents leaving her at\nHeartland to go on the road. Tara responds dismissively, but Mallory says she\nshould realize that other people have problems too. After this, Tara comes\naround. Mallory even persuades her to take a riding lesson, making a deal with\nTara that Mallory will try out the goth look and attitude in exchange. Amy\ntakes them back to the dude ranch so that she can watch them and there will be\nenough room for everyone, then sits outside with Ty by the fire as Mallory and\nTara have a pillow fight. Ty confides that he didn't want the other foster\nkids at Heartland because he doesn't want to be a poster boy for the\nrehabilitation program. Ty reveals that his mother remarried a man who was\nhorrible to them both. He made a vow to pay him back for the pain he\ninflicted, and when he did, the neighbours called the cops. At this point, Ty\nmet Clint, who was supposed to deal with the hopeless cases. Amy is happy that\nTy finally shared his story, and tells him that she's happy Clint brought him\nto Heartland.  \n28 | 15 | \"Dark Horse\" | Dean Bennett | Leila Basen and David Preston | March 1, 2009 (2009-03-01) | 215  \nWhen a county by-law threatens to separate elderly Mrs. Bell from her beloved\npony Sugarfoot, Lou revives the Hudson Charity Derby to raise money for a\nlegal defense fund. This reawakens an old rivalry between Tim and Jack, who\nwere the reason the derby became defunct many years previously. Both dispute\nwho won, because Tim won by going off-course during the race. Both sign up for\nthis derby to settle their score. Kit drops off her horse Money (short for\nYou're so Money), whom she thought was a chuckwagon horse, to Heartland for\nrehoming. Scott looks at the horse and determines that he has a tattoo,\nmeaning he was a racehorse. Ty looks up Money's records and discovers that he\nwas a success when racing. Amy helps get Tim's [palomino](/wiki/Palomino\n\"Palomino\") horse in shape for the race, as Tim is still having difficulty\nriding due to his shoulder. Ty helps Jack train on their \"secret weapon\"\nbecause Jack's horse, Paint, is too old to race in the derby. Tim and Jack are\ndoing well in the race, until Tim falls off his horse and Jack stops to help\nhim. Scott wins the race and Tim and Jack tie for second (although Tim's horse\nwas ahead by a little bit, if you watch closely). Amy and Ty are recruited to\nbe spotters at the halfway point, which doesn't work out, as the walkie\ntalkies that Amy and Lou communicate on are unable to connect properly over\nsuch a distance. Ty and Amy start play-fighting and almost kiss. Ashley's mom\noffers to sponsor Caleb so he can join the professional rodeo circuit and\nleave Hudson. This episode features some comic relief between Jack and Tim -\nTim offers Jack hay, and Jack thinks it will be free. They haggle over price,\nand Jack plans to take the hay. They disagree later, and he comes back to\nreturn the hay. In all, the hay is lifted onto and taken off of the bed of\nJack's truck no less than four times.  \n29 | 16 | \"The Ties That Bind\" | Dean Bennett | Penny Gummerson | March 8, 2009 (2009-03-08) | 216  \nThe episode opens with Amy and Spartan out on a ride as dusk is falling. For\nno clear reason, Spartan is acting a bit uneasy. This part of the episode is\nfilmed as if through the eyes of someone watching Amy and her horse, always\nwith trees between the scene and the audience. When they return to the barn,\nAmy also seems uneasy, and decides not to let Ty turn Spartan out with the\nother horses overnight. That night, Amy tosses and turns, seeing the night her\nmom died in her dreams, while Wes breaks into the barn and escapes with\nSpartan. When Amy wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to check on\nhim, she discovers that Spartan is gone. The family speaks to the police to\ntrack Spartan, but Ty and Amy also spend the next couple weeks checking horse\nauctions to see if Spartan turns up. They visit the Highwood Auction, and Ty\nbuys a two-year-old [bay](/wiki/Bay_horse \"Bay horse\") gelding named Harley.\nAmy is angry that he spent the money he'd been saving for a motorcycle on a\nhorse, but he says that he's almost a motorcycle, due to the name. Amy starts\nto storm out, but Ty stops her when he sees Spartan turn up. Spartan is there\nand Wes buys him \"legally\". Amy tries to prove that Spartan is her horse, but\nshe doesn't possess a bill of sale, and current registration papers don't\nprove it without one. Wes is unable to leave with Spartan right away because\nTy slashed his tires to ensure he couldn't leave before they talked to the\nbrand inspector. Ty chases down Wes later, hoping to buy Spartan back, but Wes\nrefuses to sell him for any price. Amy later plans to return and steal Spartan\nfrom the auction house, and Ty tries to talk her out of it, saying it's a\n[felony](/wiki/Felony \"Felony\"). (This is actually untrue in Alberta, as\n[indictable offences](/wiki/Summary_offence#Canada \"Summary offence\") are\napplied in Canada. This is one of a limited number of regional errors in this\nshow.) In the end, Ty reluctantly agrees to help her that evening. Ty gets\ncaught and taken to jail, where Jack bails him out, but he may still be\nconvicted. Jack and Tim track down Wes and force him to sign a bill of sale,\nreturning Spartan and preventing similar problems for Amy in the future. Jack\nalso talks to Constable Rodriguez, who promises to destroy the file on Ty's\ntheft attempt. Ty instead has to do 200 hours of community service, and Amy is\ngrounded until further notice. Mallory's horse, Copper, is scared of her\nbecause of her \"goth\" look, so she returns to her normal style by the end of\nthe episode. Lou is apprehensive of revealing to her family that she is dating\nan oil guy, and goes to extreme measures to avoid them seeing her with Peter.\nCaleb gets his rodeo card, and Val offers him a sponsorship to go on the road\nand stay away from Ashley. Caleb debates whether to take it, and talks to both\nTy and Kit about it. In the end, he decides to go, and does so at the end of\nthe episode.  \n30 | 17 | \"Full Circle\" | Don McBrearty | Penny Gummerson | March 15, 2009 (2009-03-15) | 217  \nSpartan refuses to jump for Amy and she is suffering from the trauma of having\nhim stolen, so Amy takes him to Marion's [Aboriginal\nCanadian](/wiki/Aboriginal_Canadian \"Aboriginal Canadian\") friend Victor\nWhitetail who helps people connect with their horses. He helps Amy process her\nfeelings and heal, using traditional Aboriginal methods. Victor was more than\nfriends with Marion after Tim left. Peter books the entire dude ranch in order\nto spend time with Lou, who continues to keep him a secret from her family.\nPeter is forced to tell Lou he has an ex-wife when he has to take care of\ntheir dog, Max. Lou promises to let him meet her family, now that she knows\nmore about his. Ty breaks Harley while Amy stays at Victor's, but gets into a\nfight with Kit when she tries to show him her methods. Later, Ty breaks up\nwith Kit, realizing he has feelings for Amy; when she returns, he tells her he\ncan't continue being only friends. Ashley mopes around because Caleb hasn't\nspoken to her since leaving for the rodeo circuit.  \n31 | 18 | \"Step By Step\" | Don McBrearty | Heather Conkie | March 22, 2009 (2009-03-22) | 218  \nTy tells Jack and Amy that this winter is very hard on the mustangs in the\nmountains, and Amy wants to go feed them. Jack says it will make them\ndependent on people. At dinner, Mallory reveals that Ty has earned his high\nschool diploma and later tells Amy that he's at a crossroads, and asks if Amy\nhas any plans. She replies that she's working on it. Her method is revealed\nwhen we see Amy talking about sneaking up to the fishing cabin with Ty to feed\nthe horses, which will also give them a great opportunity to talk. Jack comes\ninto the barn to tell them that it's now necessary to feed the horses, and the\nthree of them can go up that weekend. However, Lou has weekend plans and\nMallory and Jake have nowhere to stay, so Jack winds up looking after them.\nThis leaves Amy and Ty free to follow through with their plans, _in the open._\nWhen they arrive, Amy and Ty spread out the hay for the horses, and Ty\ncollapses after thinking he sees Ghost. (This is the second time that Ghost\nshows up when Ty is in danger.) Ty develops a high fever, but no one else can\nreach the fishing cabin because the highway is closed. Lou was heading to a\nspa with Peter along one of the mountain highways, but they were forced to\nturn back due to the closures. Lou made an attempt to tell Jack about Peter,\nbut Mallory and Jake spilled something in the other room, and Jack took them\nto Maggie's. When they return, Lou introduces Peter to Jack, who is incredibly\nunhappy that Lou is dating an oil guy, even calling him the enemy. However,\nafter Amy contacts Jack via the cabin's shortwave radio, Peter organizes\nsnowplows to clear the highway in the morning, and Jack grudgingly accepts\nhim. Amy cares for Ty overnight, and his fever eventually breaks. It turns out\nthat Ghost really was there, not a hallucination of Ty's brought on by\nillness. Upon seeing Ghost outside, the pair go out to greet him, and Amy\nbegins to talk about what Ty said. She agrees they can't just be friends,\nadmitting that she loves him. Ty finally tells Amy his feelings for her.\nMeanwhile, Val gets her test results back, and they are negative. Val tells\nAshley that she sponsored Caleb, which causes Ashley to become upset with her\nmom and Caleb. When he returns to his trailer, Ashley kicks him out. Later,\nVal is driving along, and pulls over to answer her phone and discover that she\nneeds further tests. Jack gives Tim a loan, since Tim was thinking of selling\nland to Val to be able to afford to continue after losing his herd of cattle,\nwhich would turn Val into Jack's neighbour on both sides. Once they return to\nHeartland, Amy and Ty get cozy on the couch. He makes Amy say she loves him\nagain, and they kiss.  \n  \n### Season 3\n(2009-10)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Heartland_episodes&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Season 3 \\(2009-10\\)\")]\n\nNo.  \noverall | No. in  \nseason | Title | Directed by | Written by | Original air date | Prod.  \ncode  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n32 | 1 | \"Miracle\" | Steve DiMarco | [Heather Conkie](/wiki/Heather_Conkie \"Heather Conkie\") | October 4, 2009 (2009-10-04) | 301  \nWhen a coach bus and a horse trailer collide on Highway 95, they block the\nroute for Amy's school bus to get to her high school. Ignoring a command to\nstay on the bus, Amy goes to help Caesar, a [grey](/wiki/Gray_horse \"Gray\nhorse\") gelding with Olympic prospects, stuck in a barbed wire fence. Amy\ncalms him down while his trainer, Stuart Forrest, cuts the barbed wire to free\nhim. When Amy turns around, a crowd has gathered to watch, with several\nindividuals filming her. One of these recordings is presented on the news,\ncausing Heartland to become famous overnight. Amy struggles to keep up with\nthe pressure while trying to heal Caesar, who is spooked by loud noises, cars,\nand horse trailers after the accident. Amy earns the nickname \"Miracle Girl\",\nwhich she likes even less than the comments of \"horse whispering\" when people\ntalked about Marion's and her gift previously. Ty applied for a vet program,\nand accepted an offer from Scott to apprentice/intern with him in the\nmeantime. Ty begins to question his decision after his first job with Scott\nwas to help at the scene of the accident, which included the\n[euthanasia](/wiki/Animal_euthanasia \"Animal euthanasia\") of a few severely\ninjured horses. Caleb punches Ty for hurting Kit, saying that he had warned\nhim not to. Jack lets Caleb stay in the loft with Ty, as Caleb is living in\nhis truck, unable to get his trailer back from Ashley. She starts working at\nMaggie's to afford to live on her own. Amy and Ty make plans to get Ashley and\nCaleb back together, so Ty doesn't have to listen to his snoring. Lisa comes\nback from France and asks Jack if he misses her when she is away. Jack\nexplains that he misses her, but there's a lot going on at the ranch to occupy\nhis time. Tim buys a new herd of cows with some of the money that Jack lent\nhim. Jack gets upset, but Lisa tells him that he can't tell Tim how to use the\nloan. Jack asks Val about her deal with Tim, and she says there isn't one. He\nalso asks her how she's feeling, and she says that her doctor says she is in\nremission, but \"this blood thing's a tricky customer\". This seems to imply\nthat Val had one of the blood cancers ([leukemia](/wiki/Leukemia \"Leukemia\"),\n[lymphoma](/wiki/Lymphoma \"Lymphoma\"), or [myeloma](/wiki/Myeloma \"Myeloma\"))\nwhich was treated successfully in the time between seasons. Val hasn't told\nAshley, not wanting to worry her, and she thanks Jack for taking her to her\nappointments, saying he is a true friend.  \n33 | 2 | \"Little Secrets\" | Steve DiMarco | Leila Basen and David Preston | October 11, 2009 (2009-10-11) | 302  \nAmy finds herself caught in a family crisis when she tries to help a 10-year-\nold girl, Taylor Kennedy, and her horse Trooper recover from what appears to\nbe a freak accident. Taylor was in a full-body cast after Trooper started\ngalloping apparently out of the blue, and she fell off. Trooper also lunges at\nTaylor when they first arrive, and Amy notes that she has only seen this with\nabused horses. Ty thinks it is unlikely that a young girl would abuse her\nhorse, but Mallory cautions that they shouldn't underestimate Taylor. After\nAmy has been working with Trooper and Taylor together for a while, getting her\nto spend time with her horse and then grooming him together, she assesses that\nthe horse is fine, and that perhaps the problem lies with Taylor. Amy also\nfinds out that the Kennedys are getting divorced, and that Taylor will go to\nany lengths to get them to stay together. Taylor also almost hurts Trooper one\nnight while he's in Heartland's care, advancing on him with a large branch in\nhand, while Mallory looks on. She also gets on and hits him with a riding crop\nto make him gallop like he did during the accident. Amy stops them before they\nreach a cliff, but then Taylor starts running. Amy catches her and reveals\nthat she's pieced together the mystery. When they return to the ranch, Amy\ntakes Kate Kennedy aside and tells her that her daughter needs some\nprofessional help (Amy says she can help Trooper, but she can't help Taylor).\nAmy offers to take care of Trooper while Taylor's problems are sorted out,\nhowever long that takes. In the meantime, Heartland continues to be very busy\nthanks to Amy's reputation as the \"Miracle Girl\", meaning that Jack is making\nextra pens behind the barn to deal with more horses, and Lou and Tim are\nthinking about expansion plans for the dude ranch. Amy is also treating Roxy,\na horse that is barn sour (meaning she is reluctant to leave her stall).\nAshley and Caleb continue to be at odds, and Amy brings Soraya into her and\nTy's plans to get them back together. The two girls talk to Ashley, but she\nhas figured out what they are up to (and why), and asks them to stay out of\nit. Lou continues to try to keep Amy's schedule manageable, but Tim continues\nto interfere, promising service to people that Lou says will have to wait.  \n34 | 3 | \"Man's Best Friend\" | Dean Bennett | Heather Conkie | October 18, 2009 (2009-10-18) | 303  \nJack's truck breaks down more and more often, causing Lisa and him to miss a\nwedding they were supposed to go to. Lisa and the rest of the family try to\nconvince him to upgrade. They persuade him to visit the Chevy dealership, and\nhe comes home with a new grey Silverado, after trading in his old truck for\n$1000. However, he continues to complain about the truck, its seat settings,\nits lack of comfort, etc. He becomes upset, and takes the truck up to the\nfishing cabin. The family can't understand why Jack is so attached to his old\ntruck, but the audience learns through a flashback sequence that Jack's late\nwife, Amy and Lou's grandmother, Lyndy bought him the 1972 Chevrolet Cheyenne\n10[4] as an anniversary gift early in their marriage. In the meantime, Amy is\ntrying to help a horse named Duke, whose stable-mate died recently, by trying\nto get him to bond with Pegasus. Mallory and Jake stop by, looking for Kramer,\nJake's black-and-white paint cow pony, who has a habit of escaping from pens\nby jumping the fences. When they find him, they ask Amy to solve his problem.\nAmy recognizes that the horse actually jumps fences without provocation,\nsimply because he loves to jump. Amy's solution is for Mallory to take Kramer\naround a jumping course regularly, to keep his extra energy in check and make\nhim behave for Jake's family. Kramer also helps Amy with Duke, because the two\nhorses become fast friends. She is then able to get Duke to socialize with the\nother horses and to get over his grief. The end-of-school dance is also coming\nup fast, and Amy and Ty are supposed to go together. Amy was going to use one\nof Lou's old dresses, but Lisa gives her a beautiful turquoise gown from\nParis. Ty is worried because he doesn't know how to dance, so he takes lessons\nfrom Lou (and Peter, who's back from a business trip to Dubai). Amy and Ty\nhead out to their dance, but Ty's truck breaks down. Instead, they wind up\ndancing in the bed of the truck, and Ty presents Amy with a promise ring.\nAshley asks a rich boy from a private school to go with her as a date to the\ndance to make Caleb jealous. Caleb hitches his trailer to his truck, and tries\nto pull it away, but he and Ashley wind up laughing about it before she drives\noff with the other boy. Jack's problems with the new truck are solved when he\nfinds a used truck, much like his old one, but in much better shape. Old\nGoldie (the old truck) is brought back to the farm as a \"lawn ornament\" and\nsits beside another old, dead truck.  \n35 | 4 | \"The Haunting of Hanley Barn\" | Dean Bennett | Mark Haroun | October 25, 2009 (2009-10-25) | 304  \nSomething is scaring the horses at night in the Hanley Barn and Amy is called\nin to investigate. At first, Amy thinks it might be the feed, but Mr. Hanley\nrejects this suggestion as he'd already talked about it with the vet. Amy\nagrees to come back that night to investigate further, and Ty comes with her\nat Jack's request. Meanwhile, Badger returns to Heartland, having run away\nfrom his foster home to see his birth parents, but they had moved without\nleaving him any contact information. He talks to Ty about it, saying that he\nneeds somewhere to stay overnight. Ty lets him stay temporarily, and Mallory\nfinds Badger sketching by the lake. Both seem interested in each other, as\nBadger almost tells Mallory she looks more grown-up than before, and Mallory\nasks about Tara, who Badger seemed to be dating when they first showed up in\nSeason 2. Clint stops by looking for Badger, and Ty pretends he hasn't seen\nhim, to give Badger some time to cool off before having to return to his\nfoster home. Mallory steals food for Badger, and the story returns to Amy. She\nand Ty are at Maggie's, and Ty asks why everyone thinks the barn is haunted.\nSoraya, Amy, Ashley, and Mallory recount the tale: A young man was working at\nthe Hanley place, and fell in love with the farmer's daughter. One night, the\nbarn erupted into flame and all the horses, as well as the young man, died in\nthe fire. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Hanley's parents bought the farm from the\nprevious owners and they built a new barn on top of the original's location.\nNow it is believed that The Drifter, the young man, haunts the barn, and he is\nportrayed as wearing a black cloak, with a hook for a hand, and no face under\nhis hood. Just then, Caleb bangs in, wearing a heavy black cloak because the\nweather's turning. Amy and Ty go to the Hanley place, and spend several hours\njust playing cards. While they are there, Caleb, Soraya, and Ashley show up to\nscare them (in which they succeed). Noises come from upstairs, which Amy had\nnoticed earlier in the day. Amy and Ty investigate, despite Mr. Hanley's\nprevious warning that the loft is strictly off-limits. They discover Mallory\nand Badger upstairs, and tell them to go home. At this point, Mr. Hanley\nappears and explains that the loft has dry rot, which is why he told Amy not\nto go upstairs. In the end, Amy discovers that Mr. Hanley's neighbour, Brett,\nhas been spiking the horses' feed with a [glycogen\nloader](/wiki/Carbohydrate_loading \"Carbohydrate loading\"), meant to give\nhorses energy, which is the reason they are so worked up in the morning. He\nwants to force Mr. Hanley into foreclosure, so he can buy the land. Once that\nproblem's solved, Ty decides to help Badger by coaching him through how to\napologize to Clint, which Badger does. Ty also tells Badger to come back to\nHeartland if he runs away again, so that he'll be safe. Later, Mallory flips\nthrough Badger's sketchpad while he's not around and sees a drawing of her.\nShe asks him about it, and they wind up kissing. Lou is planning on visiting\nPeter in Denver, Colorado, for a single day while he has a layover on his way\nback to Dubai. Jack disapproves, and says it's an awful long distance to\ntravel for a single day together. Lou can't understand why he's so easy on Amy\nand hard on her, but Jack eventually reveals it's because Amy reminds him so\nmuch of Marion, and Lou reminds him of himself. He also says that he worries\nabout when she'll leave again, possibly for New York, or _worse_ (in his\neyes), Toronto. Mrs. Bell comes over to use the kitchen to make strawberry jam\nwith Lou's help. While she's there, Mrs. Bell reminisces, and tells Mallory,\nabout Thomas Ritter (aka The Drifter), her first boyfriend. She gave him a jar\nof jam, and he returned the empty jar with a butterfly in it. Towards the end\nof the episode, Mrs. Bell brings a butterfly in a jar to the grave at the\nHanley farm where he was buried, and releases it in his memory.  \n36 | 5 | \"Glory Days\" | [Don McBrearty](/wiki/Don_McBrearty \"Don McBrearty\") | Leila Basen and David Preston | November 1, 2009 (2009-11-01) | 305  \nIn the hopes of impressing Ashley, Caleb takes lessons in\n[bulldogging](/wiki/Steer_wrestling \"Steer wrestling\") from former rodeo\nchampion Tim, who considers getting back into competition, and refuses to\nacknowledge that he may no longer have what it takes. Amy helps them with\nthis. Tim pays Jack back for his loan in cows, and Jack relives his glory days\nas well, working with the cattle herd. He realizes he can't do it alone, and\ngets Tim's help, _for a price_. Tim wants a paycheque and grazing fees,\nmeaning the herd of cattle might not be much of a return of the loan. Kit's\nbarrel horse is foaling, and Ty helps Scott check on the mare while waiting\nfor her time to come. They talk, and Kit congratulates him on getting accepted\nto two pre-vet university programs (at the [University of\nManitoba](/wiki/University_of_Manitoba \"University of Manitoba\"), and\nGrasslands Agricultural College). Kit says she knew he could do it, though he\nstruggled with Grade 12 Algebra. (This is another regional error: she means\nMath 30 Pure, as Alberta's high school maths are broken down only into Pure\n(university prep)/Applied (college prep) and Math 31 (calculus), not into\nalgebra, geometry, etc., like some other provinces.) Ty assists Scott with the\ndelivery, which is complicated by the fact that the foal is upside down. Its\nhead and right foreleg get stuck while Scott tries to turn it, and the foal is\n[stillborn](/wiki/Stillborn \"Stillborn\"). Kit and Ty sort out their lingering\nbreak-up issues while Ty comforts Kit, who is visibly upset. After the birth,\nthe mare refuses to leave the dead foal alone, so they try to get her to bond\nwith an orphaned foal, Merlin, instead. It's hard going at first, but Amy\ncomes over to help and rubs the foal with the blanket that was on the dead\nfoal, making him smell like the mare's foal. At that point, the mare accepts\nMerlin and he's able to nurse, which seems to be a success. Lou invites Peter\nto manage his business from the Heartland facilities while his office in\nCalgary undergoes renovation, which soon turns out to be a mistake. Peter also\ninterferes with Lou and Mallory's agreement for Copper, telling Mallory that\nshe has actually completely paid off her share of Copper's ownership, and then\nsome. Caleb repays Val for her sponsorship, and he talks about his reasons for\ntrying bulldogging. He thinks it will be safer, but Tim later tells him that\nit's even more dangerous than bronc riding, because there are more variables\nwith more animals. Val tells Ashley that Caleb's a good guy, and tells her\nthat the money was repaid. Val asks Ashley to forgive her and give her a\nsecond chance and Ashley moves back to Briar Ridge. While she's leaving, she\nseems to make her peace with Caleb.  \n37 | 6 | \"Growing Pains\" | Don McBrearty | [Susin Nielsen](/wiki/Susin_Nielsen \"Susin Nielsen\") | November 8, 2009 (2009-11-08) | 306  \nAfter Daisy rejects the orphan foal Merlin, Scott brings the colt (played by a\nfilly) to Amy to care for him. Ty and Amy split the every two hour feedings\n24x7. The stress of the schedule and differences in foal (read child) rearing\nlead Amy and Ty to clash over how best to raise Merlin. Lou arranges a meeting\nfor Peter with a famously wealthy and eco-minded oil billionaire Richard\nChenoweth at the Heartland facilities. Something about Richard seems off\nwhenever Peter is out of earshot. The local wildlife official warns Jack about\na cougar in the area. The cougar's presence in Heartland is unmistakable,\neventually causing Richard to fall off his horse during a trail ride with Lou\nand Peter. After Peter comes to Lou's defense following unwanted advances from\nRichard, Lou must defuse a threatened lawsuit from the unscrupulous\nbusinessman. Lou is successful and in a most satisfying manner. Meanwhile, Val\nis trying too hard to reconnect with her newly reconciled daughter Ashley and\nAshley is feeling suffocated. The cougar is captured, revealing a secret and\nshowing some of Jack's character.  \n38 | 7 | \"The Starting Gate\" | [Grant Harvey](/wiki/Grant_Harvey \"Grant Harvey\") | David Moses | November 15, 2009 (2009-11-15) | 307  \nTy is working a job at the race track in Hudson.

When\nthe stewards rule that Lightning Dexter can't load (and thus race) Lisa asks\nAmy if she can work with Dexter on his gate issues. Amy tells her that she can\nnot take on another horse. Then Lisa decides to sell Dexter as a riding horse.\nTy's mom, Lily, unexpectedly comes to reconnect with him, surprising all. Amy\nis none too pleased that the woman who hurt Ty has come to visit.
