The\n_Liberator_ was a newspaper established by Garrison and his supporters founded\nupon moral principles.[2] The _North Star_ title was a reference to the\ndirections given to runaway slaves trying to reach the Northern states and\nCanada: Follow the North Star.[4] Published weekly, _The North Star_ was four\npages long and sold by subscription at the cost of $2 per year to more than\n4,000 readers in the United States, Europe, and the West Indies. The first of\nits four pages focused on current events concerning abolitionist issues.[5]\n\nThe Garrisonian _Liberator_ was founded upon the notion that the Constitution\nwas fundamentally pro-slavery and that the Union ought to be dissolved.\nDouglass disagreed but supported the [nonviolent](/wiki/Nonviolent\n\"Nonviolent\") approach to the emancipation of slaves by education and moral\nsuasion.[6] Under the guidance of the abolitionist society, Douglass became\nwell acquainted with the pursuit of the emancipation of slaves through a New\nEngland religious perspective.[7] Garrison had earlier convinced the\nMassachusetts Anti-Slavery Society to hire Douglass as an agent, touring with\nGarrison and telling audiences about his experiences in slavery Douglass\nworked with another abolitionist, [Martin R. Delany](/wiki/Martin_R._Delany\n\"Martin R. Delany\"), who traveled to lecture, report, and generate\nsubscriptions to _The North Star_.[4]\n\n## Editorial perspective

antislavery convention in\n[Buffalo, New York](/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York \"Buffalo, New York\"), in August\n1843. One of the many speakers present at the convention was [Henry Highland\nGarnet](/wiki/Henry_Highland_Garnet \"Henry Highland Garnet\"). Formerly a slave\nin Maryland, Garnet was a Presbyterian minister who supported violent action\nagainst slaveholders. Garnet's demands of independent action addressed to the\nAmerican slaves remained one of the leading issues of change for Douglass.\n\nDuring a nineteen-month stay in\n[Britain](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland \"United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Ireland\") and [Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\"), several of\nDouglass’ supporters bought his freedom and assisted with the purchase of a\n[printing press](/wiki/Printing_press \"Printing press\"). With this assistance\nDouglass was determined to begin an [African-American](/wiki/African-American\n\"African-American\") newspaper that would engage the anti-slavery movement\npolitically. On his return to the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United\nStates\") in March 1847, Douglass shared his ideas of _The North Star_ with his\nmentors. Ignoring the advice of the [American Anti-Slavery\nSociety](/wiki/American_Anti-Slavery_Society \"American Anti-Slavery Society\"),\nDouglass moved to [Rochester, New York](/wiki/Rochester,_New_York \"Rochester,\nNew York\") to publish the first edition. When questioned on his decision to\ncreate _The North Star_ , Douglass is said to have responded,\n\n> \"I still see before me a life of toil and trials..., but, justice must be\n> done, the truth must be told...I will not be silent.\"[8]\n\nIn covering politics in Europe, literature, slavery in the United States, and\nculture generally in both _The North Star_ and _[Frederick Douglass'\nPaper](/w/index.php?title=Frederick_Douglass%27_Paper&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Frederick Douglass' Paper \\(page does not exist\\)\")_, Douglass achieved an\nunconstrained independence to write freely on topics from the California Gold\nRush to _Uncle Tom 's Cabin_ to Charles Dickens's _Bleak House._[9]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_North_Star_\\(anti-\nslavery_newspaper\\)&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/AmericaAfrica.svg/32px-AmericaAfrica.svg.png)](/wiki/File:AmericaAfrica.svg)[African American portal](/wiki/Portal:African_American \"Portal:African American\")\n\n  * [Abolitionist publications](/wiki/Abolitionism#Abolitionist_publications \"Abolitionism\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_North_Star_\\(anti-\nslavery_newspaper\\)&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Retrofitting Rochester: Talman Building\"](http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/rocroots/2015/02/13/retrofitting-rochester-talman-building/23389203/). _Rochester Democrat and Chronicle_.
