They are topped by the\n_[kalasam](/wiki/Kalasam \"Kalasam\")_ , a bulbous stone [finial](/wiki/Finial\n\"Finial\"). They function as gateways through the walls that surround the\ntemple complex.[3]\n\nThe gopuram's origins can be traced back to early structures of the\n[Pallava](/wiki/Pallavas \"Pallavas\") kings, and relate to the central\n[shikhara](/wiki/Shikhara \"Shikhara\") towers of North India. Between the\ntwelfth and sixteenth century, during the [Pandya](/wiki/Pandya \"Pandya\"),\nNayaka and Vijayanagara era when Hindu temples increasingly became a hub of\nthe urban life, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer\nappearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured\nfrom view by the gopuram's colossal size and courtyards.[4] It also dominated\nthe inner sanctum in amount of ornamentation. Often a shrine has more than one\ngopuram.[1] They also appear in architecture outside India, especially [Khmer\narchitecture](/wiki/Khmer_architecture \"Khmer architecture\"), as at [Angkor\nWat](/wiki/Angkor_Wat \"Angkor Wat\").\n\nA large Dravidian-style temple, or koil, may have multiple gopurams as the\nopenings into successively smaller walled enclosures around the main shrine,\nwith the largest generally at the outer edges. The temple compound is\ntypically square or rectangular with at least the outermost wall having\ngopuras, often from the four cardinal directions. The multiple storeys of a\ngopuram typically repeat the lower level features on a rhythmic diminishing\nscale.[4] The inner sanctum and its towering roof (the central deity's shrine)\nis also called the _[Vimanam (shrine)](/wiki/Vimana_\\(architectural_feature\\)\n\"Vimana \\(architectural feature\\)\")_ , although in the south it is typically\nsmaller than the gopurams in large temples.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Etymology\n  * 2 Architecture\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 Notes\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Etymology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gopuram&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Etymology\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/1834_sketch_of_elements_in_Hindu_temple_architecture%2C_single_storey_gopura.jpg/161px-1834_sketch_of_elements_in_Hindu_temple_architecture%2C_single_storey_gopura.jpg)](/wiki/File:1834_sketch_of_elements_in_Hindu_temple_architecture,_single_storey_gopura.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/1834_sketch_of_elements_in_Hindu_temple_architecture%2C_two_storey_gopura.jpg/150px-1834_sketch_of_elements_in_Hindu_temple_architecture%2C_two_storey_gopura.jpg)](/wiki/File:1834_sketch_of_elements_in_Hindu_temple_architecture,_two_storey_gopura.jpg)\n\nA gopura is a monumental gate, usually ornate with odd number of _kalasa_ on\ntop. It may have one or many storeys. Left: Single storey gopura; Right: Two\nstorey gopura.\n\nThe [Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language \"Tamil language\") derivation is from the two\nwords: கோ (kō) and புறம் (puram) meaning 'king' and 'exterior'\nrespectively.[5] It originates from the [Sangam age](/wiki/Sangam_age \"Sangam\nage\") when it was known as ஓங்கு நிலை வாயில் (ōnggu nilai vāyil) meaning\n'imperishable gateway'.[6]\n\nAn alternative derivation is from the [Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit \"Sanskrit\")\nword _gopuram_ , which can be broken down to _go_\n([Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit_language \"Sanskrit language\"): गो), which means\neither 'a city' or 'a cow', and _[puram](/wiki/Pur_\\(Vedic\\) \"Pur \\(Vedic\\)\")_\n([Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit_language \"Sanskrit language\"): पुरम्), 'a town', or\n'a settlement'.[7]\n\n## Architecture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gopuram&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Architecture\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Gopuram_Madras.jpg/220px-\nGopuram_Madras.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gopuram_Madras.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gopuram_Madras.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDetail of a gopuram at [Chennai](/wiki/Chennai \"Chennai\")\n\nA gopuram is usually a tapering [oblong](/wiki/Rectangle \"Rectangle\") in form\nwith ground-level wooden doors, often richly decorated, providing access.\nAbove is the tapering or [\"battered\"](/wiki/Batter_\\(walls\\) \"Batter\n\\(walls\\)\") gopuram, divided into many storeys which diminish in size as the\ngopuram tower narrows. Usually the tower is topped with a [barrel\nvaulted](/wiki/Barrel_vault \"Barrel vault\") roof with a finial.[4] The form\nbegan rather modestly in the 10th century, as at [Shore\nTemple](/wiki/Shore_Temple \"Shore Temple\"), [Mamallapuram](/wiki/Mamallapuram\n\"Mamallapuram\"), with the 11th century [Brihadeeswarar\nTemple](/wiki/Brihadeeswarar_Temple \"Brihadeeswarar Temple\") in\n[Thanjavur](/wiki/Thanjavur \"Thanjavur\") marking a crucial step forward with\ntwo multi-storey gopurams from that period, much larger than any earlier ones,\nthough much smaller than the main tower (vimanam) of the temple. The four\ngopurams of the [Thillai Nataraja Temple,\nChidambaram](/wiki/Thillai_Nataraja_Temple,_Chidambaram \"Thillai Nataraja\nTemple, Chidambaram\") are important early examples, begun in the mid-13th\ncentury but completed over a longer period.[8] Gopurams are exquisitely\ndecorated with sculpture and carvings and painted with a variety of themes\nderived from the [Hindu mythology](/wiki/Hindu_mythology \"Hindu mythology\"),\nparticularly those associated with the presiding [deity](/wiki/Deity \"Deity\")\nof the temple where the gopuram is located.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe two tallest gopuras are both modern, at least in part. The\n[Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam](/wiki/Ranganathaswamy_Temple,_Srirangam\n\"Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam\"), [Tamil Nadu](/wiki/Tamil_Nadu \"Tamil\nNadu\"), has 21 _[gopurams](/wiki/Gopurams \"Gopurams\")_ (tower gateways),\nincluding the towering 239.5-foot (73.0 m) _Rajagopuram_ (shrine of the main\ngateway), which is claimed as the tallest temple tower in Asia. The 73-metre\n(240 ft)-tall 13-tiered _Rajagopuram_ was completed in 1987 (having previously\nbeen incomplete) and dominates the landscape for kilometers around, while the\nremaining 20 gopurams were built between the 14th and 17th centuries.[9]\nCompeting for the title of \"tallest\" is the twenty storey 249-foot (76 m)\ngopura at the modern [Murdeshwar](/wiki/Murdeshwar \"Murdeshwar\") Temple,\nwhich, unusually, is provided with a [lift](/wiki/Elevator \"Elevator\").[10]\n\n  *
