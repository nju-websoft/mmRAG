It\nwas the successor to the previous YZ426F which was discontinued in 2003. It is\ncredited by _[Cycle World](/wiki/Cycle_World \"Cycle World\")_ and _Dirt Rider_\nmagazines as the bike that started the [four-stroke](/wiki/Four-stroke \"Four-\nstroke\") dirt bike revolution.[1][2] It is a replacement for the\n[YZ250](/wiki/YZ250 \"YZ250\"), which is slowly being phased out. The 2006\nYZ250F and YZ450F were the first production motorcycles equipped with titanium\n[suspension](/wiki/Motorcycle_suspension \"Motorcycle suspension\") springs.[3]\n\nThe [WR450F](/wiki/Yamaha_WR450F \"Yamaha WR450F\") is the [enduro](/wiki/Enduro\n\"Enduro\") version of the YZ450F.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Introduction\n  * 2 First generation: YZ400F 1998–2000\n  * 3 Second generation: YZ426F 2001–2002\n  * 4 Third generation YZ450F 2003–2005\n  * 5 Fourth generation YZ450F 2006–2009\n  * 6 Fifth generation YZ450F 2010-2013\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Introduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Yamaha_YZ450F&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Introduction\")]\n\nFor many years, the motocross world almost exclusively used two-stroke\nengines. [AMA](/wiki/American_Motorcyclist_Association \"American Motorcyclist\nAssociation\") racing classes had two classes: 125 cc and 250 cc two-strokes,\nwith no provision for four strokes. Most riders considered four-stroke engine\ntechnology to be largely utilitarian and uncompetitive, relegated solely for\ntrail riding.[4]\n\nIn 1996, the AMA changed racing rules to allow 450 cc four strokes to compete\nin the same racing class as 250 cc two-strokes.[5] Yamaha engineer Yoshiharu\nNakayama first came up with the idea of creating the first competitive four-\nstroke race motocross bike.[6] The Yamaha YZ400F was developed to fit into\nthis category. It solved the power dilemma by borrowing superbike technology\nand giving the YZ a five-valve head, liquid cooling and a 12.5-1 compression\nratio.\n\nIn 1997, Yamaha rocked the motocross world with the introduction of the YZ400M\nprototype, a concept motorcycle which borrowed much technology from road\nracing. The YZM was far ahead of all competition among four-stroke motocross\nbikes. [Doug Henry](/wiki/Doug_Henry_\\(motocross\\) \"Doug Henry \\(motocross\\)\")\npiloted the YZ400M to its first victory in 1997 at the Las Vegas Supercross.\nThis was the first time any four-stroke had won an AMA event.[7] The YZ400M\nwas the predecessor of the production YZ400F, which was released the next\nyear.\n\nFirst Generation YZ400F Production | 1998-2000  \n---|---  \nPredecessor | YZ250 2-stroke  \nSuccessor | YZ426F  \n[Engine](/wiki/Motorcycle_engine \"Motorcycle engine\") | Five-valve, 400 cc, compression ratio 12.5:1  \n[Transmission](/wiki/Motorcycle_transmission \"Motorcycle transmission\") | 5-speed  \nWeight | 250 lb (110 kg) ([dry](/wiki/Motorcycle_testing_and_measurement#Dry_weight \"Motorcycle testing and measurement\"))  \n  \n  \n## First generation: YZ400F\n1998–2000[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Yamaha_YZ450F&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: First generation: YZ400F 1998–2000\")]\n\nYamaha introduced the YZ400F in production in 1998 after a successful AMA\nseason in 1997. It was \"the first modern production four-stroke motocrosser\nthat was directly competitive against two-strokes.\"[1] Initially, Yamaha\ntargeted a dry weight of 233 pounds (106 kg) (on par with the 250 two-strokes\nof the time), but by production, the bike weighed 250 pounds. The bike had an\n11,600 rpm redline[8][_[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS\n\"Wikipedia:NOTRS\")_] power and torque close to its 250 cc two-stroke\nrivals.[1] It benefited from engine compression braking, which allowed the\nengine to slow the bike down during deceleration, giving the brakes a rest.[1]\nThe 1998 [YZ400F](/wiki/YZ400F \"YZ400F\") was the first bike to come stock with\na [Keihin](/wiki/Keihin_Corporation \"Keihin Corporation\") FCR\n[carburetor](/wiki/Carburetor \"Carburetor\").\n\nIn 1998, [Doug Henry](/wiki/Doug_Henry_\\(motocross\\) \"Doug Henry\n\\(motocross\\)\") won the AMA National Motocross Championship aboard the YZF,\nbecoming the first rider to win a championship on a four-stroke motorcycle.\nThis victory is considered by some to be the major turning point in the\nmotocross world—for the first time, four strokes were considered a competitive\nracing machine.[7]\n\nSecond generation YZ426F Production | 2000-2003  \n---|---  \nPredecessor | YZ400F  \nSuccessor | YZ450F  \n[Engine](/wiki/Motorcycle_engine \"Motorcycle engine\") | Titanium five-valve, 426 cc, 95mm x 60.1mm stroke, compression ratio 12.5:1  \n[Transmission](/wiki/Motorcycle_transmission \"Motorcycle transmission\") | 5-speed  \n[Suspension](/wiki/Suspension_\\(motorcycle\\) \"Suspension \\(motorcycle\\)\") | Kayaba  \n[Brakes](/wiki/Brake \"Brake\") | Disks  \n[Wheelbase](/wiki/Wheelbase \"Wheelbase\") | 58.7 in  \nFuel capacity | 2.1 gallons (7.95 L)  \n  \n## Second generation: YZ426F\n2001–2002[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Yamaha_YZ450F&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Second generation: YZ426F 2001–2002\")]\n\nIn 2000, Yamaha updated the YZ400F, increasing the displacement to 426 cc for\ngreater power and throttle response. In addition, the carburetor and jets were\nupdated to ease the YZ400F's starting woes.\n\nThe next year, in 2001, Yamaha replaced the previous steel valves with\ntitanium ones. The new valves were more than forty percent lighter than the\nprevious valves, allowing for lighter and softer valve springs, in turn\nallowing a quicker revving engine, improved throttle response, higher rev\nceilings, and more power.[4] The crankshaft was also reshaped and the whole\nassembly was redesigned for quicker throttle response and, Yamaha claimed,\n\"less high-end horsepower loss.\" In addition to motor modifications, a few\nchanges were made to the transmission to help contain the power and ensure\nlongevity. The suspension also received a bit of an overhaul with the goal\nbeing reduced weight and smoother action throughout the stroke.[9] Yamaha also\ndesigned a new exhaust pipe design so that exhaust header removal would no\nlonger be required when replacing the oil filter. Carburetor tuning was\nmodified to deal with starting and off-idle take off difficulties.\n\nAlso in 2001 the subframe was changed from a steel to a blue painted aluminum\nstyle. In 2002 the blue painting was stopped and left to a bare aluminum\nlook.[10] Motorcycle.com says that \"The gas tank is reasonably thin and allows\ngood forward and backward movement while providing something nicely shaped to\nhold onto with your knees. In fact, the entire ergonomic package on this YZF\nis well thought out. The handlebars have a nice bend to them and are well-\nplaced for good rider control and legroom. The footpegs are well-made units\nwith a wide platform and sit in a position that keeps them from dragging in\nruts without cramping a rider's legs.\"\n\nIn 2002 Yamaha remapped the digital CD ignition system which delivers a more\nprecise spark and optimal timing for faster, stronger response during hard\nacceleration, and less kickback during starting. Also an all-new swingarm\nwhich is lighter and stronger for reduced weight, greater rigidity and more\ncompliant rear suspension action. While an anodized finish gives the bike a\ntricked out look. The 426 also includes a larger pivot shift for increased\ndurability. A larger rear brake disc was also added which means greater\nstopping power.[11]\n\nThird Generation YZ450F Production | 2003-2005  \n---|---  \nPredecessor | YZ426F  \n[Engine](/wiki/Motorcycle_engine \"Motorcycle engine\") | Titanium five-valve, 449 cc, 95.0 x 63.4mm, compression ratio 12.3:1  \n[Transmission](/wiki/Motorcycle_transmission \"Motorcycle transmission\") | 2003-2004: 4-speed 2005: 5-speed  \n[Frame type](/wiki/Motorcycle_frame \"Motorcycle frame\") | Steel  \nRelated | YZ250F, WR450F  \n  \n## Third generation YZ450F\n2003–2005[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Yamaha_YZ450F&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Third generation YZ450F 2003–2005\")]\n\nFor 2003, the YZF received the biggest update in its history. First, the\nengine displacement was increased with 449 cc in compliance to the new AMA\nMotocross maximum displacement rule, the engine now produced over 52 hp (39\nkW). Next, the frame and plastic were updated for a new, sleeker look.\nAdditionally, the YZF's weight was decreased from its original 250 lb (110 kg)\nto 233 lb (106 kg). The bike made tremendous power; however, many thought that\nthe bike had too much power for a motocross track.[12] The 2005 YZ450F was the\nfirst YZ450F to feature [KYB](/wiki/KYB \"KYB\") twin chamber [cartridge\nforks](/wiki/Suspension_\\(motorcycle\\)#Fork_Damping \"Suspension\n\\(motorcycle\\)\").\n\n## Fourth generation YZ450F\n2006–2009[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Yamaha_YZ450F&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Fourth generation YZ450F 2006–2009\")]\n\nFourth Generation YZ450F Production | 2006-2009  \n---|---  \nPredecessor | YZ450F  \n[Engine](/wiki/Motorcycle_engine \"Motorcycle engine\") | Titanium five-valve, 449 cc, 95.0 x 63.4mm, compression ratio 12.3:1  \n[Transmission](/wiki/Motorcycle_transmission \"Motorcycle transmission\") | 5-speed  \n[Frame type](/wiki/Motorcycle_frame \"Motorcycle frame\") | Aluminum  \nFuel capacity | 1.9gal  \nRelated | YZ250F, WR450F  \n  \nThe YZ450F received a major update in 2006, with over 300 parts changed and\nimproved. The power was smoothed out, and the bike was made easier to ride,\nputting to rest the complaint that the YZ had too much power.[13] The\ntransmission was returned to a more traditional five-speed. An all-new\naluminum single backbone frame shaved another 10 pounds off the weight.\n\nThe 2006 saw KYB SSS forks.\n\n2007 saw camshaft and exhaust changes, moving power from low-RPMs to mid-RPMs.\n2008-2009 furthered pushed the powerband to mid-RPMs.\n\n## Fifth generation YZ450F\n2010-2013[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Yamaha_YZ450F&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Fifth generation YZ450F 2010-2013\")]\n\nFifth Generation YZ450F Production | 2010-Present  \n---|---  \n[Engine](/wiki/Motorcycle_engine \"Motorcycle engine\") | Rear slant, titanium four-valve, 449 cc, 97.0mm x 60.8mm stroke, compression ratio 12.5:1  \n[Transmission](/wiki/Motorcycle_transmission \"Motorcycle transmission\") | 5-speed  \nRelated | WR450F, YZ450FX  \n  \nSeptember 8, 2009, Yamaha introduced its all-new YZ450F with fuel injection.\nThe engine cylinder is rearward slanted, the crank rod angle has been changed\nto provide a more complete combustion, the 5-valve head is now a 4-valve head,\nthe gas tank is located under the seat, the exhaust pipe exits the rear of the\ncylinder, and the air intake is now in the front of the bike. They have a new\nbi-lateral frame which allows for new improved steering and the new engine\ncomponents. The entire package comes together to create a bike that is mass-\ncentralized.
