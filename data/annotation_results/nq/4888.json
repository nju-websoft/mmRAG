After a shaky\nstart,[7] they soon became best friends.[7] They have achieved such popularity\nas a duo that they are hardly ever seen apart on screen. It is reported that\nthey are each insured against the other's death, with the amount reportedly\nbeing around £1,000,000.[8] Their inseparability has led to their receiving\njoint nominations for many awards.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] They\nare both managed by the [James Grant\nGroup](/w/index.php?title=James_Grant_Group&action=edit&redlink=1 \"James Grant\nGroup \\(page does not exist\\)\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Career[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant_%26_Dec&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Career\")]\n\n### Acting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant_%26_Dec&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Acting\")]\n\nAlthough Ant had gained some television experience with a brief stint on the\nchildren's television series _[Why Don't You?](/wiki/Why_Don%27t_You%3F \"Why\nDon't You?\")_, which was broadcast on the [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\"), Dec was the\nfirst of the two to acquire his place on the BBC children's drama _[Byker\nGrove](/wiki/Byker_Grove \"Byker Grove\")_. He joined in 1989, playing Duncan. A\nyear later, Ant joined the cast to play PJ. Their friendship began when their\nstorylines collided, creating a friendship off-screen as well as on.[9] Dec\nalso played a stable boy in the adaptation of the novel _[The Cinder\nPath](/wiki/The_Cinder_Path \"The Cinder Path\")_ in his teenage years.[10] They\nalso went on to co-star in the 2006 sci-fi comedy movie [_Alien\nAutopsy_](/wiki/Alien_Autopsy_\\(film\\) \"Alien Autopsy \\(film\\)\").[11]\n\n### Music[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant_%26_Dec&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Music\")]\n\nMain article: [PJ & Duncan discography](/wiki/PJ_%26_Duncan_discography \"PJ &\nDuncan discography\")\n\nAfter leaving television, the duo turned their hand to pop music. Their first\nsingle was a song they performed while part of Byker Grove, entitled \"Tonight\nI'm Free\". The single had some success, and the duo went on to record two\nalbums under their character names of PJ & Duncan. Their most famous hit\nduring this period was the [BRIT Award](/wiki/BRIT_Awards \"BRIT Awards\")\nnominated \"Let's Get Ready To Rhumble\", for which the video and moves were\nchoreographed by Mark Short, who had previously worked with [Tina\nTurner](/wiki/Tina_Turner \"Tina Turner\") and [Peter Andre](/wiki/Peter_Andre\n\"Peter Andre\"). For their third album, the duo reinvented themselves under\ntheir real names of Ant & Dec. The album featured their signature single\n\"Shout\". \"[Let's Get Ready To Rhumble](/wiki/Let%27s_Get_Ready_To_Rhumble\n\"Let's Get Ready To Rhumble\")\" made a comeback on Saturday Night Takeaway at\nthe end of the show.\n\nTheir final single release was \"Falling\", which was the track that\nsubsequently ended their musical career. The track was pulled from the British\ncharts under the instruction of their record label, Telstar Records, after\nclaims of copyright infringement were made, brought about by a pop duo, 'And\nall because...', who were also managed by Ant and Dec's management team. The\nduo claimed that Ant & Dec had stolen the song from them and released it\nwithout their consent. Subsequently, Telstar Records decided not to renew\ntheir existing contract, and they were dropped from the label.\n\nDuring their time, the pair released sixteen [singles](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\)\n\"Single \\(music\\)\") and three studio albums; however, none of their releases\nmanaged to reach number one, with their highest UK chart position being number\nthree. The duo did, however, reach the top ten in Germany and Japan, and even\nhad a number-one single in Germany, with their cover of the Everly Brothers'\n\"All I Have to Do Is Dream\". Success also struck in other European countries.\nThe duo had a short lived revival in the music industry, releasing a song for\nthe [2002 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup \"2002 FIFA World Cup\"),\nentitled \"We're on the Ball\". The track peaked at No. 3,[12] being beaten by\n[Will Young](/wiki/Will_Young \"Will Young\") and [Gareth\nGates](/wiki/Gareth_Gates \"Gareth Gates\"). On 23 March 2013 Ant and Dec\nperformed \"Let's Get Ready To Rhumble\" as part of their show _[Ant and Dec's\nSaturday Night Takeaway](/wiki/Ant_and_Dec%27s_Saturday_Night_Takeaway \"Ant\nand Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway\")_ which powered the song to number one on\nthe UK [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\") chart and on Sunday 31 March 2013 the\ntrack was revealed as the Official UK Number 1 single on [The Official\nChart](/wiki/The_Official_Chart \"The Official Chart\") on BBC Radio 1. All\nmoney made from the re-release was donated to charity.[13]\n\n### Presenting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant_%26_Dec&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Presenting\")]\n\n#### Children's\ntelevision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant_%26_Dec&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Children's television\")]\n\nAnt & Dec got their first presenting job in 1994, while they were still\nreleasing music under the alias of PJ & Duncan. They co-presented a Saturday-\nmorning children's show entitled _[Gimme 5](/wiki/Gimme_5_\\(TV_series\\) \"Gimme\n5 \\(TV series\\)\")_ , which was broadcast on [CITV](/wiki/CITV \"CITV\"). The\nshow only lasted two series before being dropped from the airwaves.[14] In\n1995, the duo were once again offered a job on [CBBC](/wiki/CBBC \"CBBC\"), this\ntime presenting their own series, entitled _The Ant & Dec Show_. The series\nwas broadcast from 1995 to 1997, and in 1996, Ant & Dec won two [BAFTA\nAwards](/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts \"British Academy of\nFilm and Television Arts\"), one for 'Best Children's Show' and one for 'Best\nSketch Comedy Show'.[15] In 1997, a VHS release, entitled _The Ant & Dec Show\n– Confidential_, was made available in shops, and featured an hour of the best\nbits from three years of the programme, as well as specially recorded sketches\nand music videos.[16]\n\nIn 1998, the duo switched to [Channel 4](/wiki/Channel_4 \"Channel 4\"),\npresenting an early-evening children's show entitled _Ant & Dec Unzipped_.[17]\nThis show also won a BAFTA, but was dropped from the airwaves after just one\nseries.[18] [ITV](/wiki/ITV_\\(TV_network\\) \"ITV \\(TV network\\)\") soon signed\nthe duo in August 1998,[19] and within weeks, were assigned to present\n[ITV1](/wiki/ITV1 \"ITV1\")'s Saturday morning programmes _[SMTV\nLive](/wiki/SMTV_Live \"SMTV Live\")_ and _[CD:UK](/wiki/CD:UK \"CD:UK\")_ ,\nalongside old friend [Cat Deeley](/wiki/Cat_Deeley \"Cat Deeley\"). The duo\npresented the shows alongside Deeley for three years, becoming the most\npopular ITV Saturday morning show. The programme's success was the mix of\ngames such as Eat My Goal, Wonkey Donkey and Challenge Ant, sketches such as\n\"Dec Says\" and the \"Secret of My Success\", and the chemistry between Ant, Dec\nand Cat. Two _SMTV_ VHS releases, compiling the best bits from both shows,\nwere released in 2000 and 2001 respectively. Ant & Dec also starred in the\nchildren's TV series _[Engie Benjy](/wiki/Engie_Benjy \"Engie Benjy\")_ during\ntheir time on _SMTV_.[20][21]\n\nAnt & Dec made their permanent departure from children's television in 2001\nafter trying out formats like _[Friends Like These](/wiki/Friends_Like_These\n\"Friends Like These\")_ for [BBC One](/wiki/BBC_One \"BBC One\") in 2000 and\n_[Slap Bang with Ant& Dec](/wiki/Slap_Bang_with_Ant_%26_Dec \"Slap Bang with\nAnt & Dec\")_ for ITV in 2001 (which was basically _SMTV_ in the evening even\nplaying Challenge Ant against adults). They have since said that the main\nreason they left _SMTV_ was because the _[Pop Idol](/wiki/Pop_Idol \"Pop\nIdol\")_ live finals were due to begin on Saturday nights on ITV in December\n2001.\n\n#### Primetime[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant_%26_Dec&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Primetime\")]\n\nAnt & Dec's first primetime presenting job came in the form of [BBC](/wiki/BBC\n\"BBC\") Saturday-night game show _[Friends Like These](/wiki/Friends_Like_These\n\"Friends Like These\")_ , which was first broadcast in 1999 and made them known\nas presenters- a shift change from their acting days. The duo presented four\nseries of the programme between 1999 and 2001.[22] In 2001, the duo's contract\nwith [ITV](/wiki/ITV_\\(TV_network\\) \"ITV \\(TV network\\)\") was renewed for a\nfurther three years, following their appearances on _SMTV Live_ and _CD:UK_ ,\nand received their first primetime presenting job on the station, presenting\nbrand new Saturday night reality series _[Pop Idol](/wiki/Pop_Idol \"Pop\nIdol\")_ and down to this success they had to leave _SMTV_ behind. _Pop Idol_\nwas broadcast for only two series before was replaced in 2004 by _[The X\nFactor](/wiki/The_X_Factor_\\(UK_TV_series\\) \"The X Factor \\(UK TV series\\)\")_\n, to which former [Smash Hits](/wiki/Smash_Hits \"Smash Hits\") editor [Kate\nThornton](/wiki/Kate_Thornton \"Kate Thornton\") was assigned presenting duties.\n\nIn 2005, as part of the ITV's 50th birthday celebrations, they were back on\ntelevision fronting _[Ant& Dec's Gameshow\nMarathon](/wiki/Ant_%26_Dec%27s_Gameshow_Marathon \"Ant & Dec's Gameshow\nMarathon\")_, a celebration of some of ITV's most enduring gameshows from the\npast 50 years.

The show has so far run for thirteen series,\nwith series 14 due to air in early 2017. The first series was not an overall\nsuccess, but with the introduction of \"Ant & Dec Undercover\", \"What's Next?\",\n\"Ant v Dec\" and \"Little Ant and Dec\", the show became a hit. During the fourth\nseries, Dec broke his arm, thumb and suffered a concussion whilst completing a\nchallenge for the 'Ant vs. Dec' segment of the show. The incident involved\nlearning how to ride a motorbike and jumping through a ring of fire. During\nthe challenge, Dec failed to pull hard enough on the throttle of the bike,\ncausing it to topple over and sending him flying through the air. The accident\ncaused the pair to miss the _[Comic Relief](/wiki/Comic_Relief \"Comic\nRelief\")_ charity telethon of 2005. In 2006, the first episode of series five\nsaw the duo abseil down the side of the 22-storey high [London\nStudios](/wiki/The_London_Studios \"The London Studios\"), where the show was\nfilmed. Two DVDs, a best-bits book and a board game of the series were\nreleased during 2004. The show was rested after 2009 as Ant & Dec said they\nwere running out of ideas and it became stale, as many of the popular features\nsuch as \"Little Ant & Dec\" and \"Undercover\" were dropped. _Saturday Night\nTakeaway_ returned in 2013 and was a massive success; Ant & Dec resurrected\nprevious hit features such as \"Undercover\", \"Little Ant and Dec\" (albeit with\na new Little Ant and Dec) Win the Ads and Ant v Dec, with new host [Ashley\nRoberts](/wiki/Ashley_Roberts \"Ashley Roberts\"). They also brought in new\nfeatures such as the Supercomputer, Vegas or Bust, the End of the show 'show'\nwhere Ant and Dec perform with an act such as Riverdance or an Orchestra, and\n\"I'm a Celebrity, get out of my ear!\" where they have an earpiece in a celebs\near and they tell them what to do while being filmed by secret cameras. The\nseries was such a success that ITV recommissioned it for 2014 even before the\n2013 series ended.\n\nIn August 2002, Ant & Dec fronted _[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of\nHere!](/wiki/I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(UK_TV_series\\) \"I'm a\nCelebrity...Get Me Out of Here! \\(UK TV series\\)\")_. They drew their highest\nviewing figures to date in February 2004: nearly 15 million tuned in to watch\nthe third series. In May 2006, they were assigned to present coverage of the\ncharity football match _[Soccer Aid](/wiki/Soccer_Aid \"Soccer Aid\")_. They\nwere then invited back to present coverage of the second match in September\n2008 but have been replaced by [Dermot O'Leary](/wiki/Dermot_O%27Leary \"Dermot\nO'Leary\") from 2010 as the match clashed with _[Britain's Got\nTalent](/wiki/Britain%27s_Got_Talent \"Britain's Got Talent\")_. In June 2006,\nthey announced they had created a new game-show format for ITV, entitled\n_[PokerFace](/wiki/PokerFace_\\(game_show\\) \"PokerFace \\(game show\\)\")_. The\nshow featured members of the public gambling high stakes of money in an\nattempt to win the ultimate prize. The first series began airing on 10 July\n2006, and was aired for seven consecutive nights. The second series was\nbroadcast in early 2007, and saw a move to a prime-time Saturday slot. Ratings\nfor the series fell to below 3.5 million, and the series was subsequently axed\nin March 2007. A board game of the format was released in 2008.\n\nIn April 2007, the duo signed a two-year [golden\nhandcuffs](/wiki/Golden_handcuffs \"Golden handcuffs\") deal with ITV,\nreportedly worth [£](/wiki/Pound_sterling \"Pound sterling\")40 million,\nsecuring their career at the station until the end of 2009.[23] In June 2007,\nthey were offered the job of presenters on new ITV reality platform _Britain\n's Got Talent_ by [Simon Cowell](/wiki/Simon_Cowell \"Simon Cowell\").

The series was highly successful,\ndrawing in nearly 12 million viewers. A second series was broadcast in May\n2008, and drew in nearly 14.5 million viewers.[24] They have since returned to\npresent ten series of the show, and have also had a regular feature on the\n[ITV2](/wiki/ITV2 \"ITV2\") spin-off show _[Britain's Got More\nTalent](/wiki/Britain%27s_Got_More_Talent \"Britain's Got More Talent\")_.\n\nThe pair filmed a series of six episodes for a new American game show, _[Wanna\nBet?](/wiki/Wanna_Bet%3F \"Wanna Bet?\")_ , in November 2007. The episodes was\nbroadcast in 2008, but failed to attract enough interest for a second series\nto be commissioned.[25] _What You Wrote_ , another format created by the duo,\nwas due to air in Autumn 2008 but was reportedly axed by\n[ITV](/wiki/ITV_\\(TV_network\\) \"ITV \\(TV network\\)\").[26] In 2010, the duo\ndebuted a replacement for _Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway_, entitled\n_[Ant& Dec's Push the Button](/wiki/Ant_%26_Dec%27s_Push_the_Button \"Ant &\nDec's Push the Button\")_. The series was a success albeit not in the same way\nas _Saturday Night Takeaway_ , and a second run of the programme was broadcast\nin 2011 but Ant and Dec later dropped the show in favour of reviving _Saturday\nNight Takeaway_.\n\nAnt & Dec have also presented the game show _[Red or\nBlack?](/wiki/Red_or_Black%3F \"Red or Black?\")_ , a creation of Cowell's,\nairing live on ITV in 2011 with a second series in 2012, but this was not a\nratings success and was cancelled after the second series.
