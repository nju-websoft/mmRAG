[low-pressure](/wiki/Low-pressure_area \"Low-\npressure area\") center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, [strong\nwinds](/wiki/Beaufort_scale \"Beaufort scale\"), and a spiral arrangement of\n[thunderstorms](/wiki/Thunderstorm \"Thunderstorm\") that produce heavy rain.\nDepending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by\ndifferent names, including hurricane ([/ˈhʌrɪkən,\n-keɪn/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\")),[1][2][3]\n[typhoon](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Hurricane_or_typhoon \"Tropical cyclone\")\n([/taɪˈfuːn/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\")), tropical storm,\ncyclonic storm, [tropical\ndepression](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Tropical_depression \"Tropical cyclone\"),\nand simply cyclone.[4] A [hurricane](/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane \"Atlantic\nhurricane\") is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the [Atlantic\nOcean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean \"Atlantic Ocean\") and northeastern [Pacific\nOcean](/wiki/Pacific_Ocean \"Pacific Ocean\") and a [typhoon](/wiki/Typhoon\n\"Typhoon\") occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean; while in the south\nPacific or [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian Ocean\"), comparable\nstorms are referred to simply as “tropical cyclones” or “severe cyclonic\nstorms”.[4]\n\n“Tropical” refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form\nalmost exclusively over [tropical](/wiki/Tropics \"Tropics\") seas. “Cyclone”\nrefers to their winds moving in a circle,[5] whirling round their central\nclear [eye](/wiki/Eye_\\(cyclone\\) \"Eye \\(cyclone\\)\"), with their winds blowing\n[counterclockwise](/wiki/Clockwise_and_counterclockwise \"Clockwise and\ncounterclockwise\") in the [Northern Hemisphere](/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere\n\"Northern Hemisphere\") and blowing clockwise in the [Southern\nHemisphere](/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere \"Southern Hemisphere\"). The opposite\ndirection of circulation is due to the [Coriolis effect](/wiki/Coriolis_effect\n\"Coriolis effect\"). Tropical cyclones [typically\nform](/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis \"Tropical cyclogenesis\") over large bodies\nof relatively warm water. They derive their energy through the evaporation of\n[water](/wiki/Water \"Water\") from the [ocean](/wiki/Ocean \"Ocean\") surface,\nwhich ultimately [recondenses](/wiki/Condensation \"Condensation\") into\n[clouds](/wiki/Cloud \"Cloud\") and rain when moist air rises and cools to\n[saturation](/wiki/Saturated_fluid \"Saturated fluid\"). This [energy\nsource](/wiki/Energy_source \"Energy source\") differs from that of [mid-\nlatitude cyclonic storms](/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone \"Extratropical\ncyclone\"), such as [nor'easters](/wiki/Nor%27easter \"Nor'easter\") and\n[European windstorms](/wiki/European_windstorm \"European windstorm\"), which\nare fueled primarily by [horizontal temperature\ncontrasts](/wiki/Baroclinic_instability \"Baroclinic instability\"). Tropical\ncyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km (62 and 1,243 mi) in diameter.\n\nThe strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the\n[conservation of angular momentum](/wiki/Conservation_of_angular_momentum\n\"Conservation of angular momentum\") imparted by the [Earth](/wiki/Earth\n\"Earth\")'s [rotation](/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation \"Earth's rotation\") as air\nflows inwards toward the axis of rotation. As a result, they rarely form\nwithin 5° of the equator.[6] Tropical cyclones are also almost completely\nabsent from Earth’s southwestern quartersphere, mainly because the shapes of\nthe African and South American continents permit the\n[Benguela](/wiki/Benguela_Current \"Benguela Current\") and [Humboldt\nCurrents](/wiki/Humboldt_Current \"Humboldt Current\") to cover ocean basins as\nfar north as 5˚N with excessively cool water. These powerful cold currents\nalso produce much stronger [vertical wind shear](/wiki/Vertical_wind_shear\n\"Vertical wind shear\") in the South Atlantic and Southeast Pacific, which\ntypically prevent tropical depressions and minor storms there from developing\ninto cyclones and prevent even the waters of the [Brazil\nCurrent](/wiki/Brazil_Current \"Brazil Current\") from being so hot as analogous\nwestern boundary currents or ocean gyres. Also, the [African easterly\njet](/wiki/African_easterly_jet \"African easterly jet\") and areas of\natmospheric instability which gives rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and\nCaribbean Sea, along with [the Asian monsoon](/wiki/Monsoon_of_South_Asia\n\"Monsoon of South Asia\") and [Western Pacific Warm\nPool](/wiki/Western_Pacific_Warm_Pool \"Western Pacific Warm Pool\"), are\nfeature of the Northern Hemisphere and Australia.\n\nCoastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impact of a tropical\ncyclone, compared to inland regions. The primary energy source for these\nstorms is warm ocean waters, therefore these forms are typically strongest\nwhen over or near water, and weaken quite rapidly over land. Coastal damage\nmay be caused by strong winds and rain, high waves (due to winds), [storm\nsurges](/wiki/Storm_surge \"Storm surge\") (due to severe pressure changes), and\n[the potential](/wiki/Tornadogenesis \"Tornadogenesis\") of spawning\n[tornadoes](/wiki/Tornado \"Tornado\"). Tropical cyclones also draw in air from\na large area—which can be a vast area for the most severe cyclones—and\nconcentrate the [precipitation](/wiki/Precipitation \"Precipitation\") of the\nwater content in that air (made up from atmospheric moisture and moisture\nevaporated from water) into a much smaller area. This continual replacement of\nmoisture-bearing air by new moisture-bearing air after its moisture has fallen\nas rain, may cause extremely heavy rain and river flooding up to 40 kilometres\n(25 mi) from the coastline, far beyond the amount of water that the local\natmosphere holds at any one time.\n\nThough their effects on human populations are often devastating, tropical\ncyclones can relieve [drought](/wiki/Drought \"Drought\") conditions. They also\ncarry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward\n[temperate](/wiki/Temperate \"Temperate\") [latitudes](/wiki/Latitude\n\"Latitude\"), which may play an important role in modulating regional and\nglobal [climate](/wiki/Climate \"Climate\").\n\nPart of a series on  \n---  \nTropical cyclones  \nFormation and naming[show] [Development](/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis

\"Enlarge\")\n\nDiagram of a Northern hemisphere hurricane\n\nTropical cyclones are areas of relatively [low pressure](/wiki/Low-\npressure_area \"Low-pressure area\") in the [troposphere](/wiki/Troposphere\n\"Troposphere\"), with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low\naltitudes near the surface. On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of\ntropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at [sea\nlevel](/wiki/Sea_level \"Sea level\").[7] The environment near the center of\ntropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they\nare characterized as “warm core” systems.[8]\n\n### Wind field\n\nThe near-surface wind field of a tropical cyclone is characterized by air\nrotating rapidly around a [center of circulation](/wiki/Eye_\\(cyclone\\) \"Eye\n\\(cyclone\\)\") while also flowing radially inwards. At the outer edge of the\nstorm, air may be nearly calm; however, due to the Earth’s rotation, the air\nhas non-zero [absolute angular momentum](/wiki/Absolute_angular_momentum\n\"Absolute angular momentum\"). As air flows radially inward, it begins to\n[rotate cyclonically](/wiki/Cyclonic_rotation \"Cyclonic rotation\") (counter-\nclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, and clockwise in the Southern\nHemisphere) in order to [conserve angular\nmomentum](/wiki/Conservation_of_angular_momentum \"Conservation of angular\nmomentum\"). At an inner radius, air begins to ascend to the [top of the\ntroposphere](/wiki/Tropopause \"Tropopause\"). This radius is typically\ncoincident with the inner radius of the [eyewall](/wiki/Eyewall \"Eyewall\"),\nand has the strongest near-surface winds of the storm; consequently, it is\nknown as the _[radius of maximum winds](/wiki/Radius_of_maximum_wind \"Radius\nof maximum wind\")_.[9] Once aloft, air flows away from the storm's center,\nproducing a shield of [cirrus clouds](/wiki/Cirrus_cloud \"Cirrus cloud\").[10]\n\nThe previously mentioned processes result in a wind field that is nearly\n[axisymmetric](/wiki/Axisymmetric \"Axisymmetric\"): Wind speeds are low at the\ncenter, increase rapidly moving outwards to the radius of maximum winds, and\nthen decay more gradually with radius to large radii. However, the wind field\noften exhibits additional spatial and temporal variability due to the effects\nof localized processes, such as [thunderstorm\nactivity](/wiki/Atmospheric_convection \"Atmospheric convection\") and\nhorizontal [flow instabilities](/wiki/Instability#Fluid_instabilities\n\"Instability\"). In the vertical direction, winds are strongest near the\nsurface and decay with height within the troposphere.[11]\n\n### Eye and center\n\n![File:HurrArthur720p.webm](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/HurrArthur720p.webm/220px\n--HurrArthur720p.webm.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/HurrArthur720p.webm \"Play\nmedia\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:HurrArthur720p.webm \"Enlarge\")\n\nNASA animation of Hurricane Arthur in 2014 showing rain rates and internal\nstructure from [GPM](/wiki/Global_Precipitation_Measurement \"Global\nPrecipitation Measurement\") satellite data\n\nAt the center of a mature tropical cyclone, air sinks rather than rises. For a\nsufficiently strong storm, air may sink over a layer deep enough to suppress\ncloud formation, thereby creating a clear “[eye](/wiki/Eye_\\(cyclone\\) \"Eye\n\\(cyclone\\)\")”. Weather in the eye is normally calm and free of clouds,\nalthough the sea may be extremely violent.[12] The eye is normally circular in\nshape, and is typically 30–65 km (19–40 mi) in diameter, though eyes as small\nas 3 km (1.9 mi) and as large as 370 km (230 mi) have been observed.[13][14]\n\nThe cloudy outer edge of the eye is called the\n“[eyewall](/wiki/Eye_\\(cyclone\\) \"Eye \\(cyclone\\)\")”. The eyewall typically\nexpands outward with height, resembling an arena football stadium; this\nphenomenon is sometimes referred to as the _[stadium\neffect](/wiki/Eye_\\(cyclone\\)#Stadium_effect \"Eye \\(cyclone\\)\")_.[14] The\n[eyewall](/wiki/Eyewall \"Eyewall\") is where the greatest wind speeds are\nfound, air rises most rapidly, clouds reach to their highest altitude, and\nprecipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a\ntropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.[12]\n\nIn a weaker storm, the eye may be obscured by the [central dense\novercast](/wiki/Central_dense_overcast \"Central dense overcast\"), which is the\nupper-level cirrus shield that is associated with a concentrated area of\nstrong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone.[15]\n\nThe eyewall may vary over time in the form of [eyewall replacement\ncycles](/wiki/Eye_\\(cyclone\\)#Eyewall_replacement_cycles \"Eye \\(cyclone\\)\"),\nparticularly in intense tropical cyclones. [Outer rainbands](/wiki/Rainbands\n\"Rainbands\") can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly\nmoves inward, which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and\n[angular momentum](/wiki/Angular_momentum \"Angular momentum\"). When the\nprimary eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The outer\neyewall eventually replaces the primary one at the end of the cycle, at which\ntime the storm may return to its original intensity.[16]\n\n### Rapid deepening\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Typhooon_Nabi_as_seen_from_the_ISS.jpg/220px-\nTyphooon_Nabi_as_seen_from_the_ISS.jpg)](/wiki/File:Typhooon_Nabi_as_seen_from_the_ISS.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Typhooon_Nabi_as_seen_from_the_ISS.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Typhoon Nabi](/wiki/Typhoon_Nabi \"Typhoon Nabi\") as seen from the\n[International Space Station](/wiki/International_Space_Station \"International\nSpace Station\"), on September 3, 2005.\n\nMain article: [Rapid deepening](/wiki/Rapid_deepening \"Rapid deepening\")\n\nOn occasion, tropical cyclones may undergo a process known as rapid deepening,\na period in which the minimum sea-level pressure of a tropical cyclone\ndecreases by 42mb in a 24-hour period.[17] In order for rapid deepening to\noccur, several conditions must be in place. [Water\ntemperatures](/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature \"Sea surface temperature\") must be\nextremely high (near or above 30 °C, 86 °F), and water of this temperature\nmust be sufficiently deep such that waves do not upwell cooler waters to the\nsurface. [Wind shear](/wiki/Wind_shear \"Wind shear\") must be low; when wind\nshear is high, the [convection](/wiki/Convection#Atmospheric_convection\n\"Convection\") and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted. Usually, an\n[anticyclone](/wiki/Anticyclone \"Anticyclone\") in the upper layers of the\n[troposphere](/wiki/Troposphere \"Troposphere\") above the storm must be present\nas well—for extremely low surface pressures to develop, air must be rising\nvery rapidly in the [eyewall](/wiki/Eye_\\(cyclone\\) \"Eye \\(cyclone\\)\") of the\nstorm, and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the\ncyclone efficiently.[18]\n\n### Size\n\nSize descriptions of tropical cyclones  \n---  \nROCI | Type  \nLess than 2 degrees latitude | Very small/midget  \n2 to 3 degrees of latitude | Small  \n3 to 6 degrees of latitude | Medium/Average  \n6 to 8 degrees of latitude | Large  \nOver 8 degrees of latitude | Very large[19]  \n  \nThere are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size. The most\ncommon metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind\n(i.e. [gale force](/wiki/Gale \"Gale\")), the radius of outermost closed\n[isobar](/wiki/Isobar_\\(meteorology\\) \"Isobar \\(meteorology\\)\")\n([ROCI](/wiki/Radius_of_outermost_closed_isobar \"Radius of outermost closed\nisobar\")), and the radius of vanishing wind.[20][21] An additional metric is\nthe radius at which the cyclone's relative [vorticity](/wiki/Vorticity\n\"Vorticity\") field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.[14]\n\nOn Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100–2,000\nkilometres (62–1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are\nlargest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the\nnortheastern Pacific Ocean basin.[22] If the radius of outermost closed isobar\nis less than two [degrees of latitude](/wiki/Latitude \"Latitude\") (222 km (138\nmi)), then the cyclone is \"very small\" or a \"midget\". A radius of 3–6 latitude\ndegrees (333–670 km (207–416 mi)) is considered \"average sized\". \"Very large\"\ntropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552\nmi)).[19] Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to\nvariables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum\nwind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.[21][22]\n\nSize plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else\nequal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time.\nAdditionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher [storm\nsurge](/wiki/Storm_surge \"Storm surge\") due to the combination of longer wind\n[fetch](/wiki/Fetch_\\(geography\\) \"Fetch \\(geography\\)\"), longer duration, and\nenhanced [wave setup](/wiki/Wave_setup \"Wave setup\").[23]\n\nThe upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the\n[tropopause](/wiki/Tropopause \"Tropopause\") of the atmosphere, which at low\nlatitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres (50,000–60,000 ft).[24]\n\n## Physics and energetics\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Hurricane_profile.svg/250px-\nHurricane_profile.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Hurricane_profile.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hurricane_profile.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTropical cyclones exhibit an overturning circulation where air inflows at low\nlevels near the surface, rises in thunderstorm clouds, and outflows at high\nlevels near the tropopause.[25]\n\nThe [three-dimensional](/wiki/Three-dimensional \"Three-dimensional\") wind\nfield in a tropical cyclone can be separated into two components: a \"primary\ncirculation\" and a \"[secondary circulation](/wiki/Secondary_circulation\n\"Secondary circulation\")\". The primary circulation is the rotational part of\nthe flow; it is purely circular. The secondary circulation is the overturning\n(in-up-out-down) part of the flow; it is in the\n[radial](/wiki/Geometric_terms_of_location \"Geometric terms of location\") and\nvertical directions. The primary circulation is larger in magnitude,\ndominating the surface wind field, and is responsible for the majority of the\ndamage a storm causes, while the secondary circulation is slower but governs\nthe [energetics](/wiki/Energetics \"Energetics\") of the storm.\n\n### Secondary circulation: a Carnot heat engine\n\nA tropical cyclone's primary energy source is heat from the evaporation of\n[water](/wiki/Water \"Water\") from the [ocean](/wiki/Ocean \"Ocean\") surface,\nwhich ultimately [recondenses](/wiki/Condensation \"Condensation\") into clouds\nand rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to\n[saturation](/wiki/Saturated_fluid \"Saturated fluid\"). The energetics of the\nsystem may be idealized as an atmospheric [Carnot heat\nengine](/wiki/Carnot_heat_engine \"Carnot heat engine\").[26] First, inflowing\nair near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water (i.e.\n[latent heat](/wiki/Latent_heat \"Latent heat\")) at the temperature of the warm\nocean surface (during evaporation, the ocean cools and the air warms). Second,\nthe warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat\ncontent (latent heat is simply converted to [sensible\nheat](/wiki/Sensible_heat \"Sensible heat\") during\n[condensation](/wiki/Condensation \"Condensation\")). Third, air outflows and\nloses heat via [infrared radiation](/wiki/Thermal_radiation \"Thermal\nradiation\") to space at the temperature of the cold\n[tropopause](/wiki/Tropopause \"Tropopause\"). Finally, air\n[subsides](/wiki/Subsidence_\\(atmosphere\\) \"Subsidence \\(atmosphere\\)\") and\nwarms at the outer edge of the storm while conserving total heat content. The\nfirst and third legs are nearly [isothermal](/wiki/Isothermal \"Isothermal\"),\nwhile the second and fourth legs are nearly [isentropic](/wiki/Isentropic\n\"Isentropic\"). This in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the [secondary\ncirculation](/wiki/Secondary_flow \"Secondary flow\"). The Carnot perspective\nprovides an [upper bound](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Maximum_potential_intensity\n\"Tropical cyclone\") on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain.\n\nScientists estimate that a tropical cyclone releases heat energy at the rate\nof 50 to 200 [exajoules](/wiki/Exajoule \"Exajoule\") (1018 J) per day,[27]\nequivalent to about 1 PW (1015 watt). This rate of energy release is\nequivalent to 70 times the [world energy\nconsumption](/wiki/World_energy_resources_and_consumption \"World energy\nresources and consumption\") of humans and 200 times the worldwide electrical\ngenerating capacity, or to exploding a 10-[megaton](/wiki/TNT_equivalent \"TNT\nequivalent\") [nuclear bomb](/wiki/Nuclear_bomb \"Nuclear bomb\") every 20\nminutes.[27][28]\n\n### Primary circulation: rotating winds\n\nThe primary rotating flow in a tropical cyclone results from the [conservation\nof angular momentum](/wiki/Conservation_of_angular_momentum \"Conservation of\nangular momentum\") by the secondary circulation. [Absolute angular\nmomentum](/wiki/Absolute_angular_momentum \"Absolute angular momentum\") on a\nrotating planet  M {\\displaystyle M}\n![M](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd)\nis given by\n\n     M = 1 2 f r 2 + v r {\\displaystyle M={\\frac {1}{2}}fr^{2}+vr} ![M = \\\\frac{1}{2}fr^2 + vr](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e745754a2255a0214ba8f79b212758289099d639)\n\nwhere  f {\\displaystyle f}\n![f](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61)\nis the [Coriolis parameter](/wiki/Coriolis_parameter \"Coriolis parameter\"),  v\n{\\displaystyle v}\n![v](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597)\nis the azimuthal (i.e. rotating) wind speed, and  r {\\displaystyle r}\n![r](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538)\nis the radius to the axis of rotation. The first term on the right hand side\nis the component of planetary angular momentum that projects onto the local\nvertical (i.e. the axis of rotation). The second term on the right hand side\nis the relative angular momentum of the circulation itself with respect to the\naxis of rotation. Because the planetary angular momentum term vanishes at the\nequator (where  f = 0 {\\displaystyle f=0}\n![f=0](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ee0fdf0f50fcba5afe3e856fcc7dc6acfa61014)\n), tropical cyclones rarely [form](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Formation \"Tropical\ncyclone\") within 5° of the equator.[6][29]\n\nAs air flows radially inward at low levels, it begins to rotate cyclonically\nin order to conserve angular momentum. Similarly, as rapidly rotating air\nflows radially outward near the tropopause, its cyclonic rotation decreases\nand ultimately changes sign at large enough radius, resulting in an upper-\nlevel [anti-cyclone](/wiki/Anti-cyclone \"Anti-cyclone\"). The result is a\nvertical structure characterized by a strong [cyclone](/wiki/Cyclone\n\"Cyclone\") at low levels and a strong [anti-cyclone](/wiki/Anti-cyclone \"Anti-\ncyclone\") near the [tropopause](/wiki/Tropopause \"Tropopause\"); from [thermal\nwind balance](/wiki/Thermal_wind \"Thermal wind\"), this corresponds to a system\nthat is warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all\naltitudes (i.e. “warm-core”). From [hydrostatic\nbalance](/wiki/Hydrostatic_balance \"Hydrostatic balance\"), the warm core\ntranslates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes, with the maximum\npressure drop located at the surface.[11]\n\n### Maximum potential intensity\n\nDue to surface friction, the inflow only partially conserves angular momentum.\nThus, the sea surface lower boundary acts as both a source (evaporation) and\nsink (friction) of energy for the system. This fact leads to the existence of\na theoretical upper bound on the strongest wind speed that a tropical cyclone\ncan attain. Because evaporation increases linearly with wind speed (just as\nclimbing out of a pool feels much colder on a windy day), there is a positive\nfeedback on energy input into the system known as the Wind-Induced Surface\nHeat Exchange (WISHE) feedback.[26] This feedback is offset when frictional\ndissipation, which increases with the cube of the wind speed, becomes\nsufficiently large. This upper bound is called the “maximum potential\nintensity”,  v p {\\displaystyle v_{p}}\n![v_p](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/537e72b1a70774ae976de89f7919dc0e0a9bb86d),\nand is given by\n\n     v p 2 = C k C d T s − T o T o Δ k {\\displaystyle v_{p}^{2}={\\frac {C_{k}}{C_{d}}}{\\frac {T_{s}-T_{o}}{T_{o}}}\\Delta k} ![v_p^2 = \\\\frac{C_k}{C_d}\\\\frac{T_s - T_o}{T_o}\\\\Delta k](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a7fb2f6e26d612beb99143358c734c6970bdf8d4)\n\nwhere  T s {\\displaystyle T_{s}}\n![T_{s}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/942b5ac7697c72b9e3bc1e3b340daf7189fdf61f)\nis the temperature of the sea surface,  T o {\\displaystyle T_{o}}\n![T_{o}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2991f18ef81fec2f94e3a532df91a079f3f6697d)\nis the temperature of the outflow ([K]),  Δ k {\\displaystyle \\Delta k}\n![\\\\Delta\nk](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f4119f8a26ff6ff37ca2d302fc36bf91334ec5c)\nis the enthalpy difference between the surface and the overlying air ([J/kg]),\nand  C k {\\displaystyle C_{k}}\n![C_{k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1a0887b56787ba96e79de2b9f5c6ff30aabad1c6)\nand  C d {\\displaystyle C_{d}}\n![C_{d}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d638b409d293db1874a1503bd0f87d20b3d57ed7)\nare the surface [exchange coefficients](/wiki/Heat_transfer_coefficient \"Heat\ntransfer coefficient\") ([dimensionless](/wiki/Dimensionless \"Dimensionless\"))\nof enthalpy and momentum, respectively.[30] The surface-air enthalpy\ndifference is taken as  Δ k = k s ∗ − k {\\displaystyle \\Delta k=k_{s}^{*}-k}\n![\\\\Delta k =\nk^*_s-k](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9089989e80b0a50c6c382db270b231c5ed25b91b),\nwhere  k s ∗ {\\displaystyle k_{s}^{*}}\n![k^*_s](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7532aba5f600a7c3241dfe638f5874a41ce40ed5)\nis the saturation [enthalpy](/wiki/Enthalpy \"Enthalpy\") of air at sea surface\ntemperature and sea-level pressure and  k {\\displaystyle k}\n![k](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40)\nis the enthalpy of boundary layer air overlying the surface.\n\nThe maximum potential intensity is predominantly a function of the background\nenvironment alone (i.e. without a tropical cyclone), and thus this quantity\ncan be used to determine which regions on Earth can support tropical cyclones\nof a given intensity, and how these regions may evolve in time.[31][32]\nSpecifically, the maximum potential intensity has three components, but its\n[variability in space and\ntime](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Characteristic_values_and_variability_on_Earth\n\"Tropical cyclone\") is due predominantly to the variability in the surface-air\nenthalpy difference component  Δ k {\\displaystyle \\Delta k} ![\\\\Delta\nk](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f4119f8a26ff6ff37ca2d302fc36bf91334ec5c).\n\n#### Derivation\n\nA tropical cyclone may be viewed as a [heat engine](/wiki/Heat_engine \"Heat\nengine\") that converts input [heat](/wiki/Heat \"Heat\") energy from the surface\ninto [mechanical energy](/wiki/Mechanical_energy \"Mechanical energy\") that can\nbe used to do [mechanical work](/wiki/Mechanical_work \"Mechanical work\")\nagainst surface friction.

These\nprocesses are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature (and\nunderlying ocean dynamics), background near-surface wind speed, and the\nvertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating.[36] The nature of this\nmodulation is complex, particularly on climate time-scales (decades or\nlonger). On shorter time-scales, variability in the maximum potential\nintensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the\ntropical mean, as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states\nmuch more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with\nrelatively cold water.[37] However, this relationship is indirect via the\nlarge-scale dynamics of the tropics; the direct influence of the absolute sea\nsurface temperature on  v p {\\displaystyle v_{p}}\n![v_p](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/537e72b1a70774ae976de89f7919dc0e0a9bb86d)\nis weak in comparison.\n\n### Interaction with the upper ocean\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/GulfMexTemps_2005Hurricanes.gif/220px-\nGulfMexTemps_2005Hurricanes.gif)](/wiki/File:GulfMexTemps_2005Hurricanes.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:GulfMexTemps_2005Hurricanes.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nChart displaying the drop in surface temperature in the [Gulf of\nMexico](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of Mexico\") as Hurricanes\n[Katrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina \"Hurricane Katrina\") and\n[Rita](/wiki/Hurricane_Rita \"Hurricane Rita\") passed over\n\nThe passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of\nthe ocean to cool substantially, which can influence subsequent cyclone\ndevelopment. This cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold\nwater from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters. This effect\nresults in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or\nlead to weakening. Additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from\nfalling raindrops (this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher\naltitudes). Cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean, by\nshielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the\nstorm passage. All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea\nsurface temperature over a large area in just a few days.[38]\n\n## Major basins and related warning centers\n\nMain articles: [Tropical cyclone basins](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_basins\n\"Tropical cyclone basins\") and [Regional Specialized Meteorological\nCenter](/wiki/Regional_Specialized_Meteorological_Center \"Regional Specialized\nMeteorological Center\")\n\nTropical cyclone basins and official warning centers  \n---  \nBasin | Warning center | Area of responsibility | Notes  \n**Northern Hemisphere**  \n[North Atlantic](/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane \"Atlantic hurricane\")  \n[Eastern Pacific](/wiki/Pacific_hurricane \"Pacific hurricane\") | United States [National Hurricane Center](/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center \"National Hurricane Center\")  \nUnited States [Central Pacific Hurricane Center](/wiki/Central_Pacific_Hurricane_Center \"Central Pacific Hurricane Center\") | Equator northward, African Coast – 140°W  \nEquator northward, 140°W-180 | [39]  \n[Western Pacific](/wiki/Typhoon \"Typhoon\") | [Japan Meteorological Agency](/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency \"Japan Meteorological Agency\") | Equator-60°N, 180-100°E | [40]  \n[North Indian Ocean](/wiki/North_Indian_Ocean_tropical_cyclone \"North Indian Ocean tropical cyclone\") | [India Meteorological Department](/wiki/India_Meteorological_Department \"India Meteorological Department\") | Equator northward, 100°E-45°E | [41]  \n**Southern Hemisphere**  \n[South-West  \nIndian Ocean](/wiki/South-West_Indian_Ocean_tropical_cyclone \"South-West Indian Ocean tropical cyclone\") | [Météo-France](/wiki/M%C3%A9t%C3%A9o-France \"Météo-France\") Reunion | Equator-40°S, African Coast-90°E | [42]  \n[Australian region](/wiki/Australian_region_tropical_cyclone \"Australian region tropical cyclone\") | [Indonesian Agency for Meteorology,  \nClimatology and\nGeophysics](/wiki/Indonesian_Agency_for_Meteorology,_Climatology_and_Geophysics\n\"Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics\") (BMKG)  \nPapua New Guinea National Weather Service,  \nAustralian [Bureau of Meteorology](/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology \"Bureau of Meteorology\") | Equator-10°S, 90°E-141°E  \nEquator-10°S, 141°E-160°E  \n10°S-36°S, 90°E-160°E | [43]  \n[Southern Pacific](/wiki/South_Pacific_tropical_cyclone \"South Pacific tropical cyclone\") | [Fiji Meteorological Service](/wiki/Fiji_Meteorological_Service \"Fiji Meteorological Service\")  \n[Meteorological Service of New Zealand](/wiki/Meteorological_Service_of_New_Zealand \"Meteorological Service of New Zealand\") | Equator-25°S, 160°E-120°W  \n25°S-40°S, 160°E-120°W | [43]  \n  \nThere are six [Regional Specialized Meteorological\nCenters](/wiki/Regional_Specialized_Meteorological_Center \"Regional\nSpecialized Meteorological Center\") (RSMCs) worldwide.

In most situations, [water\ntemperatures](/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature \"Sea surface temperature\") of at\nleast 26.5 °C (79.7 °F) are needed down to a depth of at least 50 m (160\nft);[56] waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be\nunstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms.[57] For tropical\ntransitioning cyclones (i.e. [Hurricane Ophelia\n(2017)](/wiki/Hurricane_Ophelia_\\(2017\\) \"Hurricane Ophelia \\(2017\\)\")) a\nwater temperature of at least 22.5 °C (72.5 °F) has been suggested.[58]\n\nAnother factor is rapid cooling with height, which allows the release of the\n[heat of condensation](/wiki/Heat_of_condensation \"Heat of condensation\") that\npowers a tropical cyclone.[56] High humidity is needed, especially in the\nlower-to-mid [troposphere](/wiki/Troposphere \"Troposphere\"); when there is a\ngreat deal of moisture in the atmosphere, conditions are more favorable for\ndisturbances to develop.[56] Low amounts of [wind shear](/wiki/Wind_shear\n\"Wind shear\") are needed, as high shear is disruptive to the storm's\ncirculation.[56] Tropical cyclones generally need to form more than 555 km\n(345 mi) or five degrees of latitude away from the [equator](/wiki/Equator\n\"Equator\"), allowing the [Coriolis effect](/wiki/Coriolis_effect \"Coriolis\neffect\") to deflect winds blowing towards the low pressure center and creating\na circulation.[56] Lastly, a formative tropical cyclone needs a preexisting\nsystem of disturbed weather. Tropical cyclones will not form\nspontaneously.[56] Low-latitude and low-level westerly wind bursts associated\nwith the [Madden-Julian oscillation](/wiki/Madden-Julian_oscillation \"Madden-\nJulian oscillation\") can create favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis\nby initiating tropical disturbances.[59]\n\n### Locations\n\nMost tropical cyclones form in a worldwide band of thunderstorm activity near\nthe [equator](/wiki/Equator \"Equator\"), referred to as the Intertropical Front\n(ITF), the [Intertropical Convergence\nZone](/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone \"Intertropical Convergence Zone\")\n(ITCZ), or the [monsoon trough](/wiki/Monsoon_trough \"Monsoon\ntrough\").[60][61][62] Another important source of atmospheric instability is\nfound in [tropical waves](/wiki/Tropical_wave \"Tropical wave\"), which\ncontribute to the development of about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the\nAtlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern\nPacific.[63][64][65] The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude\naway of the equator,[66] and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north\nor south.[67][68] Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their\nrotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5 degrees of the\nequator, where the effect is weakest.[67] However, it is still possible for\ntropical systems to form within this boundary as [Tropical Storm\nVamei](/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Vamei \"Tropical Storm Vamei\") and [Cyclone\nAgni](/wiki/Cyclone_Agni \"Cyclone Agni\") did in 2001 and 2004,\nrespectively.[69][70]\n\n## Movement\n\nThe movement of a tropical cyclone (i.e. its \"track\") is typically\napproximated as the sum of two terms: \"steering\" by the background\nenvironmental wind and \"beta drift\".[71]\n\n### Environmental steering\n\nEnvironmental steering is the dominant term. Conceptually, it represents the\nmovement of the storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental\nconditions, similar to \"leaves carried along by a stream\".[72] Physically, the\nwinds, or [flow field](/w/index.php?title=Flow_field&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Flow field \\(page does not exist\\)\"), in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone\nmay be treated as having two parts: the flow associated with the storm itself,\nand the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm\ntakes place. In this way, tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-\norder simply as [advection](/wiki/Advection \"Advection\") of the storm by the\nlocal environmental flow. This environmental flow is termed the \"steering\nflow\".\n\nClimatologically, tropical cyclones are steered primarily westward by the\neast-to-west [trade winds](/wiki/Trade_winds \"Trade winds\") on the equatorial\nside of the [subtropical ridge](/wiki/Subtropical_ridge \"Subtropical ridge\")—a\npersistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans.[72] In the\ntropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer\n[tropical easterly waves](/wiki/Tropical_wave \"Tropical wave\") westward from\nthe African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into\nthe central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out.[64] These waves are the\nprecursors to many tropical cyclones within this region.[63] In contrast, in\nthe [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian Ocean\") and Western Pacific in\nboth hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical\neasterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical\nConvergence Zone and the monsoon trough.[73] Additionally, tropical cyclone\nmotion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical\ncyclones.\n\n### Beta drift\n\nIn addition to environmental steering, a tropical cyclone will tend to drift\nslowly poleward and westward, a motion known as \"beta drift\". This motion is\ndue to the superposition of a vortex, such as a tropical cyclone, onto an\nenvironment in which the [Coriolis force](/wiki/Coriolis_force \"Coriolis\nforce\") varies with latitude, such as on a sphere or [beta\nplane](/wiki/Beta_plane \"Beta plane\"). It is induced indirectly by the storm\nitself, the result of a feedback between the cyclonic flow of the storm and\nits environment.\n\nPhysically, the cyclonic circulation of the storm advects environmental air\npoleward east of center and equatorial west of center. Because air must\nconserve its [angular momentum](/wiki/Absolute_angular_momentum \"Absolute\nangular momentum\"), this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre\nequatorward and westward of the storm center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward\nand eastward of the storm center. The combined flow of these gyres acts to\nadvect the storm slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs even if\nthere is zero environmental flow.\n\n### Multiple storm interaction\n\nMain article: [Fujiwhara effect](/wiki/Fujiwhara_effect \"Fujiwhara effect\")\n\nA third component of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves the\ninteraction of multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one\nanother, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between\nthe two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two\nvortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the\ncenter point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger\nvortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will\norbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after\n[Sakuhei Fujiwhara](/wiki/Sakuhei_Fujiwhara \"Sakuhei Fujiwhara\").[74]\n\n### Interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies\n\nSee also: [Westerlies](/wiki/Westerlies \"Westerlies\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Ioke_2006_track.png/250px-\nIoke_2006_track.png)](/wiki/File:Ioke_2006_track.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ioke_2006_track.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nStorm track of [Typhoon Ioke](/wiki/Hurricane_Ioke \"Hurricane Ioke\"), showing\nrecurvature off the Japanese coast in\n[2006](/wiki/2006_Pacific_hurricane_season \"2006 Pacific hurricane season\")\n\nThough a tropical cyclone typically moves from east to west in the tropics,\nits track may shift poleward and eastward either as it moves west of the\nsubtropical ridge axis or else if it interacts with the mid-latitude flow,\nsuch as the [jet stream](/wiki/Jet_stream \"Jet stream\") or an [extratropical\ncyclone](/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone \"Extratropical cyclone\"). This motion,\ntermed \"recurvature\", commonly occurs near the western edge of the major ocean\nbasins, where the jet stream typically has a poleward component and\nextratropical cyclones are common.[75] An example of tropical cyclone\nrecurvature was [Typhoon Ioke](/wiki/Hurricane_Ioke \"Hurricane Ioke\") in\n2006.[76]\n\n### Landfall\n\nSee also: [Tropical cyclogenesis § Unusual areas of\nformation](/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis#Unusual_areas_of_formation \"Tropical\ncyclogenesis\")\n\nThe landfall of a tropical cyclone occurs when a storm's surface center moves\nover a coastline.[9] Storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and\ninland hours before landfall; in fact, a tropical cyclone can launch its\nstrongest winds over land, yet not make landfall. NOAA uses the term \"direct\nhit\" to describe when a location (on the left side of the eye) falls within\nthe radius of maximum winds (or twice that radius if on the right side),\nwhether or not the hurricane's eye made landfall.[9]\n\n## Dissipation\n\n### Factors\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/TropicalStormFranklin05.jpg/250px-\nTropicalStormFranklin05.jpg)](/wiki/File:TropicalStormFranklin05.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:TropicalStormFranklin05.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Tropical Storm Franklin](/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Franklin_\\(2005\\) \"Tropical\nStorm Franklin \\(2005\\)\"), an example of a strongly [sheared](/wiki/Windshear\n\"Windshear\") tropical cyclone in the [North Atlantic\nhurricane](/wiki/North_Atlantic_hurricane \"North Atlantic hurricane\") basin\nduring [2005](/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"2005 Atlantic hurricane\nseason\")\n\nA tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several\ndifferent ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it of\nthe warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength.[77] Most\nstrong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become\ndisorganized areas of low pressure within a day or two, or evolve into\nextratropical cyclones. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate\nif it managed to get back over open warm water, such as with [Hurricane\nIvan](/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan \"Hurricane Ivan\"). If it remains over mountains for\neven a short time, weakening will accelerate.[78] Many storm fatalities occur\nin mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as\ntorrential rainfall.[79] This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and\nmudslides, as was the case with [Hurricane Mitch](/wiki/Hurricane_Mitch\n\"Hurricane Mitch\") around Honduras in October 1998.[80] Without warm surface\nwater, the storm cannot survive.[81]\n\nA tropical cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below\n26.5 °C (79.7 °F). This will cause the storm to lose its tropical\ncharacteristics, such as a warm core with thunderstorms near the center, and\nbecome a remnant [low-pressure area](/wiki/Low-pressure_area \"Low-pressure\narea\"). These remnant systems may persist for up to several days before losing\ntheir identity. This dissipation mechanism is most common in the eastern North\nPacific.[82] Weakening or dissipation can occur if it experiences vertical\nwind shear, causing the convection and heat engine to move away from the\ncenter; this normally ceases development of a tropical cyclone.[83] In\naddition, its interaction with the main belt of the Westerlies, by means of\nmerging with a nearby frontal zone, can cause tropical cyclones to evolve into\n[extratropical cyclones](/wiki/Extratropical_cyclones \"Extratropical\ncyclones\"). This transition can take 1–3 days.[84] Even after a tropical\ncyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated, it can still have tropical\nstorm force (or occasionally hurricane/typhoon force) winds and drop several\ninches of rainfall. In the [Pacific Ocean](/wiki/Pacific_Ocean \"Pacific\nOcean\") and [Atlantic Ocean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean \"Atlantic Ocean\"), such\ntropical-derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and may\noccasionally remain at hurricane or typhoon-force wind speeds when they reach\nthe west coast of North America. These phenomena can also affect Europe, where\nthey are known as _[European windstorms](/wiki/European_windstorm \"European\nwindstorm\")_ ; [Hurricane Iris's](/wiki/Hurricane_Iris_\\(1995\\) \"Hurricane\nIris \\(1995\\)\") extratropical remnants are an example of such a windstorm from\n1995.[85] A cyclone can also merge with another area of low pressure, becoming\na larger area of low pressure. This can strengthen the resultant system,\nalthough it may no longer be a tropical cyclone.[83] Studies in the 2000s have\ngiven rise to the hypothesis that large amounts of dust reduce the strength of\ntropical cyclones.[86]\n\n### Artificial dissipation\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the [United States\ngovernment](/wiki/United_States_government \"United States government\")\nattempted to weaken hurricanes through [Project\nStormfury](/wiki/Project_Stormfury \"Project Stormfury\") by\n[seeding](/wiki/Cloud_seeding \"Cloud seeding\") selected storms with [silver\niodide](/wiki/Silver_iodide \"Silver iodide\"). It was thought that the seeding\nwould cause [supercooled water](/wiki/Supercooled_water \"Supercooled water\")\nin the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and\nthus reducing the winds.[87] The winds of [Hurricane\nDebbie](/wiki/Hurricane_Debbie_\\(1969\\) \"Hurricane Debbie \\(1969\\)\")—a\nhurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie\nregained its strength after each of two seeding forays.[88] In an earlier\nepisode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of [Jacksonville,\nFlorida](/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida \"Jacksonville, Florida\") promptly changed\nits course after being seeded, and smashed into [Savannah,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia \"Savannah, Georgia\").[89] Because there was\nso much uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government\nwould not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10%\nchance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of\npossible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that\n[eyewall replacement cycles](/wiki/Eyewall_replacement_cycle \"Eyewall\nreplacement cycle\") occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the\nresult of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding\nis not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the\nrainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.[90]\n\nOther approaches have been suggested over time, including cooling the water\nunder a tropical cyclone by towing [icebergs](/wiki/Iceberg \"Iceberg\") into\nthe tropical oceans.[91] Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a\nsubstance that inhibits evaporation,[92] dropping large quantities of ice into\nthe eye at very early stages of development (so that the [latent\nheat](/wiki/Heat_of_condensation \"Heat of condensation\") is absorbed by the\nice, instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive\nfeedback loop),[91] or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons.[93]\nProject Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone.[94] These\napproaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are\nsimply too large and short-lived for any of the weakening techniques to be\npractical.[95]\n\n## Effects\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Hurricane_katrina_damage_gulfport_mississippi.jpg/250px-\nHurricane_katrina_damage_gulfport_mississippi.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hurricane_katrina_damage_gulfport_mississippi.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hurricane_katrina_damage_gulfport_mississippi.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe aftermath of [Hurricane Katrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina \"Hurricane\nKatrina\") in [Gulfport, Mississippi](/wiki/Gulfport,_Mississippi \"Gulfport,\nMississippi\").\n\nMain article: [Effects of tropical\ncyclones](/wiki/Effects_of_tropical_cyclones \"Effects of tropical cyclones\")\n\nTropical cyclones out at sea cause large waves, [heavy\nrain](/wiki/Heavy_rain_\\(meteorology\\) \"Heavy rain \\(meteorology\\)\"),\n[flood](/wiki/Flood \"Flood\") and high winds, disrupting international shipping\nand, at times, causing shipwrecks.[96] Tropical cyclones stir up water,\nleaving a cool wake behind them, which causes the region to be less favorable\nfor subsequent tropical cyclones.[38] On land, strong [winds](/wiki/Wind\n\"Wind\") can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, and other outside\nobjects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. The [storm\nsurge](/wiki/Storm_surge \"Storm surge\"), or the increase in sea level due to\nthe cyclone, is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones,\nhistorically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths.[97] The broad\nrotation of a landfalling tropical cyclone, and vertical wind shear at its\nperiphery, spawns [tornadoes](/wiki/History_of_tropical_cyclone-\nspawned_tornadoes \"History of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes\"). Tornadoes\ncan also be spawned as a result of [eyewall\nmesovortices](/wiki/Eyewall_mesovortices \"Eyewall mesovortices\"), which\npersist until landfall.[98]\n\nOver the past two centuries, tropical cyclones have been responsible for the\ndeaths of about 1.9 million people worldwide. Large areas of standing water\ncaused by flooding lead to infection, as well as contributing to mosquito-\nborne illnesses. Crowded evacuees in [shelters](/wiki/Emergency_shelter\n\"Emergency shelter\") increase the risk of disease propagation.[97] Tropical\ncyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure, leading to power outages,\nbridge destruction, and the hampering of reconstruction efforts.[97][99] On\naverage, the Gulf and east coasts of the United States suffer approximately US\n$5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage every year. The majority (83%) of\ntropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes, category 3 or greater.\nHowever, category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of\ncyclones that make landfall every year.[100]\n\nAlthough cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they\nmay be important factors in the\n[precipitation](/wiki/Precipitation_\\(meteorology\\) \"Precipitation\n\\(meteorology\\)\") regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed\nprecipitation to otherwise dry regions.[101] Tropical cyclones also help\nmaintain the global heat balance by moving warm, moist tropical air to the\n[middle latitudes](/wiki/Middle_latitudes \"Middle latitudes\") and polar\nregions,[102] and by regulating the [thermohaline\ncirculation](/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation \"Thermohaline circulation\")\nthrough [upwelling](/wiki/Upwelling \"Upwelling\").[103] The storm surge and\nwinds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures, but they also\nstir up the waters of coastal [estuaries](/wiki/Estuary \"Estuary\"), which are\ntypically important fish breeding locales. Tropical cyclone destruction spurs\nredevelopment, greatly increasing local property values.[104]\n\nWhen hurricanes surge upon shore from the ocean, salt is introduced to many\nfreshwater areas and raises the [salinity](/wiki/Salinity \"Salinity\") levels\ntoo high for some habitats to withstand. Some are able to cope with the salt\nand recycle it back into the ocean, but others can not release the extra\nsurface water quickly enough or do not have a large enough freshwater source\nto replace it. Because of this, some species of plants and vegetation die due\nto the excess salt.[105] In addition, hurricanes can carry\n[toxins](/wiki/Toxins \"Toxins\") and [acids](/wiki/Acids \"Acids\") onto shore\nwhen they make landfall. The flood water can pick up the toxins from different\nspills and contaminate the land that it passes over. The toxins are very\nharmful to the people and animals in the area, as well as the environment\naround them. The flooding water can also spark many dangerous oil spills.[106]\n\n## Observation and forecasting\n\n### Observation\n\nMain article: [Tropical cyclone\nobservation](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_observation \"Tropical cyclone\nobservation\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Isidore091902-p3sunset.jpg/250px-\nIsidore091902-p3sunset.jpg)](/wiki/File:Isidore091902-p3sunset.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Isidore091902-p3sunset.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSunset view of [Hurricane Isidore](/wiki/Hurricane_Isidore \"Hurricane\nIsidore\")'s rainbands photographed at 7,000 feet (2,100 m)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/NOAA_Lockheed_WP-3D_Orion_%22Hurricane_Hunter%22_%28N42RF%29_at_SENEX_Air_Quality-\nClimate_Research_Study_%289119691512%29.jpg/220px-\nNOAA_Lockheed_WP-3D_Orion_%22Hurricane_Hunter%22_%28N42RF%29_at_SENEX_Air_Quality-\nClimate_Research_Study_%289119691512%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:NOAA_Lockheed_WP-3D_Orion_%22Hurricane_Hunter%22_\\(N42RF\\)_at_SENEX_Air_Quality-\nClimate_Research_Study_\\(9119691512\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:NOAA_Lockheed_WP-3D_Orion_%22Hurricane_Hunter%22_\\(N42RF\\)_at_SENEX_Air_Quality-\nClimate_Research_Study_\\(9119691512\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Hurricane Hunter\" \\- WP-3D Orion is used to go into the eye of a hurricane\nfor data collection and measurements purposes.\n\nIntense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge, as they are\na dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and [weather stations](/wiki/Weather_station\n\"Weather station\"), being relatively sparse, are rarely available on the site\nof the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if\nthe storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby\nship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the\ncyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot\nbe evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move\ninto the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the\npoint of landfall.[107]\n\nTropical cyclones far from land are tracked by [weather\nsatellites](/wiki/Weather_satellite \"Weather satellite\") capturing\n[visible](/wiki/Visible_light \"Visible light\") and [infrared](/wiki/Infrared\n\"Infrared\") images from space, usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals.\nAs a storm approaches land, it can be observed by land-based\n[Doppler](/wiki/Pulse-Doppler_radar \"Pulse-Doppler radar\") [weather\nradar](/wiki/Weather_radar \"Weather radar\"). Radar plays a crucial role around\nlandfall by showing a storm's location and intensity every several\nminutes.[108]\n\n[In situ](/wiki/In_situ \"In situ\") measurements, in real-time, can be taken by\nsending specially equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the\nAtlantic basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government\n[hurricane hunters](/wiki/Hurricane_hunters \"Hurricane hunters\").[109] The\naircraft used are [WC-130](/wiki/WC-130 \"WC-130\") Hercules and\n[WP-3D](/wiki/WP-3D \"WP-3D\") Orions, both four-engine\n[turboprop](/wiki/Turboprop \"Turboprop\") cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly\ndirectly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The\naircraft also launch [GPS dropsondes](/wiki/GPS_dropsonde \"GPS dropsonde\")\ninside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and\nespecially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in\nhurricane observation began when a remotely piloted\n[Aerosonde](/wiki/Insitu_Aerosonde \"Insitu Aerosonde\"), a small drone\naircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's\nEastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also\ncompleted successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated a new\nway to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.[110]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/NHC_Atlantic_Forecast_Error_Trends.png/250px-\nNHC_Atlantic_Forecast_Error_Trends.png)](/wiki/File:NHC_Atlantic_Forecast_Error_Trends.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:NHC_Atlantic_Forecast_Error_Trends.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA general decrease in error trends in tropical cyclone path prediction is\nevident since the 1970s\n\n### Forecasting\n\nSee also: [Tropical cyclone track\nforecasting](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_track_forecasting \"Tropical cyclone track\nforecasting\"), [Tropical cyclone prediction\nmodel](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_prediction_model \"Tropical cyclone prediction\nmodel\"), and [Tropical cyclone rainfall\nforecasting](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_rainfall_forecasting \"Tropical cyclone\nrainfall forecasting\")\n\nBecause of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate track\npredictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-\npressure areas, and predicting how those areas will change during the life of\na tropical system. The deep layer mean flow, or average wind through the depth\nof the [troposphere](/wiki/Troposphere \"Troposphere\"), is considered the best\ntool in determining track direction and speed. If storms are significantly\nsheared, use of wind speed measurements at a lower altitude, such as at the 70\nkPa pressure surface (3,000 metres or 9,800 feet above sea level) will produce\nbetter predictions. Tropical forecasters also consider smoothing out short-\nterm [wobbles](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wiggle \"wikt:wiggle\") of the\nstorm as it allows them to determine a more accurate long-term\ntrajectory.[111] High-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software\nallow forecasters to produce [computer\nmodels](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_prediction_model \"Tropical cyclone prediction\nmodel\") that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and\nstrength of high- and low-pressure systems. Combining forecast models with\nincreased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones, as well\nas with a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting [satellites](/wiki/Satellites\n\"Satellites\") and other sensors, scientists have increased the accuracy of\ntrack forecasts over recent decades.[112] However, scientists are not as\nskillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones.[113] The lack of\nimprovement in intensity forecasting is attributed to the complexity of\ntropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their\ndevelopment. New tropical cyclone position and forecast information is\navailable at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere and at least\nevery six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from Regional Specialized\nMeteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning\nCenters.[44][114][115][116][117]\n\n## Classifications, terminology, and naming\n\n### Intensity classifications\n\nMain article: [Tropical cyclone scales](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales\n\"Tropical cyclone scales\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Typhoon_saomai_060807.jpg/250px-\nTyphoon_saomai_060807.jpg)](/wiki/File:Typhoon_saomai_060807.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Typhoon_saomai_060807.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThree tropical cyclones of the [2006 Pacific typhoon\nseason](/wiki/2006_Pacific_typhoon_season \"2006 Pacific typhoon season\") at\ndifferent stages of development. The weakest (left) demonstrates only the most\nbasic circular shape. A stronger storm (top right) demonstrates [spiral\nbanding](/wiki/Rainbands \"Rainbands\") and increased centralization, while the\nstrongest (lower right) has developed an [eye](/wiki/Eye_\\(cyclone\\) \"Eye\n\\(cyclone\\)\").\n\nTropical cyclones are classified into three main groups, based on intensity:\ntropical depressions, tropical storms, and a third group of more intense\nstorms, whose name depends on the region. For example, if a tropical storm in\nthe Northwestern Pacific reaches hurricane-strength winds on the [Beaufort\nscale](/wiki/Beaufort_scale \"Beaufort scale\"), it is referred to as a\n_typhoon_ ; if a tropical storm passes the same benchmark in the [Northeast\nPacific Basin](/wiki/Pacific_hurricane \"Pacific hurricane\"), or in [the North\nAtlantic](/wiki/North_Atlantic_hurricane \"North Atlantic hurricane\"), it is\ncalled a _hurricane_.[9] Neither \"hurricane\" nor \"typhoon\" is used in either\nthe Southern Hemisphere or the Indian Ocean. In these\n[basins](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_basins \"Tropical cyclone basins\"), storms of a\ntropical nature are referred to as either tropical cyclones, severe tropical\ncyclones or very intense tropical cyclones.\n\nAs indicated in the table below, each basin uses a separate [system of\nterminology](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales \"Tropical cyclone scales\"), which\ncan make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean,\nhurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the [180th\nmeridian](/wiki/180th_meridian \"180th meridian\") into the Northwest Pacific,\nbecoming typhoons (such as [Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke](/wiki/Hurricane_Ioke\n\"Hurricane Ioke\") in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur.[118] It\nshould also be noted that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than\n67 metres per second (m/s), over 150 miles per hour (240 km/h), are called\n_Super Typhoons_ by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.[119]\n\n#### Tropical depression\n\n\"Tropical Depression\" redirects here. For the Filipino reggae band, see\n[Tropical Depression (band)](/wiki/Tropical_Depression_\\(band\\) \"Tropical\nDepression \\(band\\)\"). For the EP by Elephant Micah, see [Tropical Depression\n(EP)](/wiki/Tropical_Depression_\\(EP\\) \"Tropical Depression \\(EP\\)\").\n\nA tropical depression or tropical low is a tropical disturbance that has a\nclearly defined [surface circulation](/wiki/Eye_\\(cyclone\\) \"Eye \\(cyclone\\)\")\nwith [maximum sustained winds](/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind \"Maximum sustained\nwind\") of less than 34 kn (39 mph; 63 km/h).[43] Within the Southern\nHemisphere, the depression can have gale force or stronger winds in one or\nmore quadrants, but not near the centre.[43]\n\n#### Tropical storm\n\n\"Tropical Storm\" redirects here. For the album, see [_Tropical Storm_\n(album)](/wiki/Tropical_Storm_\\(album\\) \"Tropical Storm \\(album\\)\").\n\nA **tropical storm** is an organized system of strong thunderstorms with a\ndefined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds between 34 knots (63\nkm/h) and 64 knots (119 km/h). At this point, the distinctive cyclonic shape\nstarts to develop, although an eye is not usually present. Government weather\nservices first assign names to systems that reach this intensity (thus the\nterm _named storm_).[120] Although tropical storms are less intense than a\nhurricane they can produce significant damage. The shear force of winds can\nblow off shingles, and air borne objects can cause damage to power lines,\nroofing and siding. More dangerous is the heavy rainfall causing inland\nflooding.[121]\n\n#### Hurricane or typhoon\n\nMain articles: [Atlantic hurricane](/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane \"Atlantic\nhurricane\"), [Pacific hurricane](/wiki/Pacific_hurricane \"Pacific hurricane\"),\nand [typhoon](/wiki/Typhoon \"Typhoon\")\n\nA hurricane or typhoon (sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone, as\nopposed to a depression or storm) is a system with sustained winds of at least\n34 m/s (66 kn; 76 mph; 120 km/h).[120] A cyclone of this intensity tends to\ndevelop an eye, an area of relative calm (and lowest atmospheric pressure) at\nthe center of circulation. The eye is often visible in satellite images as a\nsmall, circular, cloud-free spot. Surrounding the eye is the\n[eyewall](/wiki/Eyewall \"Eyewall\"), an area about 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) to 80\nkilometres (50 mi) wide in which the strongest\n[thunderstorms](/wiki/Thunderstorm \"Thunderstorm\") and winds circulate around\nthe storm's center. Maximum sustained winds in the strongest tropical cyclones\nhave been estimated at about 95 m/s (185 kn; 210 mph; 340 km/h).[122]\n\n[hide]**Tropical cyclone classifications**  \n---  \n[Beaufort  \nscale](/wiki/Beaufort_scale \"Beaufort scale\") | 1-minute sustained winds | 10-minute sustained winds | NE Pacific &  \nN Atlantic  \n[NHC](/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center \"National Hurricane Center\")/[CPHC](/wiki/Central_Pacific_Hurricane_Center \"Central Pacific Hurricane Center\")[39] | NW Pacific  \n[JTWC](/wiki/Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center \"Joint Typhoon Warning Center\") | NW Pacific  \n[JMA](/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency \"Japan Meteorological Agency\") | N Indian Ocean  \n[IMD](/wiki/Indian_Meteorological_Department \"Indian Meteorological Department\")[41] | SW Indian Ocean  \n[MF](/wiki/M%C3%A9t%C3%A9o-France \"Météo-France\") | Australia & S Pacific  \n[BOM](/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology_\\(Australia\\) \"Bureau of Meteorology\n\\(Australia\\)\")/[FMS](/wiki/Fiji_Meteorological_Service \"Fiji Meteorological\nService\")[43]  \n0–7 | <32 knots (37 mph; 59 km/h) | <28 knots (32 mph; 52 km/h) | Tropical Depression | Tropical Depression | Tropical Depression | Depression | Zone of Disturbed Weather | Tropical Disturbance  \nTropical Depression  \nTropical Low  \n7 | 33 knots (38 mph; 61 km/h) | 28–29 knots (32–33 mph; 52–54 km/h) | Deep Depression | Tropical Disturbance  \n8 | 34–37 knots (39–43 mph; 63–69 km/h) | 30–33 knots (35–38 mph; 56–61 km/h) | Tropical Storm | Tropical Storm | Tropical Depression  \n9–10 | 38–54 knots (44–62 mph; 70–100 km/h) | 34–47 knots (39–54 mph; 63–87 km/h) | Tropical Storm | Cyclonic Storm | Moderate Tropical Storm | Category 1  \ntropical cyclone  \n11 | 55–63 knots (63–72 mph; 102–117 km/h) | 48–55 knots (55–63 mph; 89–102 km/h) | Severe Tropical Storm | Severe Cyclonic Storm | Severe Tropical Storm | Category 2  \ntropical cyclone  \n12+ | 64–71 knots (74–82 mph; 119–131 km/h) | 56–63 knots (64–72 mph; 104–117 km/h) | Category 1 hurricane | Typhoon  \n72–82 knots (83–94 mph; 133–152 km/h) | 64–72 knots (74–83 mph; 119–133 km/h) | Typhoon | Very Severe  \nCyclonic Storm | Tropical Cyclone | Category 3 severe  \ntropical cyclone  \n83–95 knots (96–109 mph; 154–176 km/h) | 73–83 knots (84–96 mph; 135–154 km/h) | Category 2 hurricane  \n96–97 knots (110–112 mph; 178–180 km/h) | 84–85 knots (97–98 mph; 156–157 km/h) | Category 3 major hurricane  \n98–112 knots (113–129 mph; 181–207 km/h) | 86–98 knots (99–113 mph; 159–181 km/h) | Extremely Severe  \nCyclonic Storm | Intense Tropical Cyclone | Category 4 severe  \ntropical cyclone  \n113–122 knots (130–140 mph; 209–226 km/h) | 99–107 knots (114–123 mph; 183–198 km/h) | Category 4 major hurricane  \n123–129 knots (142–148 mph; 228–239 km/h) | 108–113 knots (124–130 mph; 200–209 km/h) | Category 5 severe  \ntropical cyclone  \n130–136 knots (150–157 mph; 241–252 km/h) | 114–119 knots (131–137 mph; 211–220 km/h) | Super Typhoon | Super Cyclonic Storm | Very Intense Tropical Cyclone  \n>137 knots (158 mph; 254 km/h) | >120 knots (140 mph; 220 km/h) | Category 5 major hurricane  \n  \n### Origin of storm terms\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/101.typhoon.altonthompson.jpg/250px-101.typhoon.altonthompson.jpg)](/wiki/File:101.typhoon.altonthompson.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:101.typhoon.altonthompson.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Taipei 101](/wiki/Taipei_101 \"Taipei 101\") endures a typhoon in 2005\n\nThe word _typhoon_ , which is used today in the Northwest Pacific, may be\nderived from [Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language \"Arabic language\") _ţūfān_ (طوفان)\n(similar in [Hindustani](/wiki/Hindustani_language \"Hindustani language\") and\n[Persian](/wiki/Persian_language \"Persian language\")), which in turn\noriginates from [Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\")\n_[Typhon](/wiki/Typhon \"Typhon\")_ (Τυφών), a monster from [Greek\nmythology](/wiki/Greek_mythology \"Greek mythology\") associated with\nstorms.[123] The related [Portuguese](/wiki/Portuguese_language \"Portuguese\nlanguage\") word _tufão_ , used in Portuguese for typhoons, is also derived\nfrom _Typhon._[124][_[disputed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement\n\"Wikipedia:Disputed statement\") (for: folk etymology?) –\n[discuss](/wiki/Talk:Tropical_cyclone \"Talk:Tropical cyclone\")_] The word is\nalso similar to Chinese \"táifēng\" (Simplified Chinese: 台风, Traditional\nChinese: 颱風) (fēng = wind), \"toifung\" in [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese\n\"Cantonese\"), \"taifū\" (台風) in Japanese, and \"taepung\" (태풍) in Korean.\n\nThe word _hurricane_ , used in the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, is\nderived from _huracán_ , the Spanish word for the [Carib](/wiki/Island_Caribs\n\"Island Caribs\")/[Taino](/wiki/Taino_people \"Taino people\") storm god,\n[Juracán](/wiki/Jurac%C3%A1n \"Juracán\").

The\ngod was also credited with later destroying the \"wooden people\", the\nprecursors to the \"[maize people](/wiki/Maya_maize_god \"Maya maize god\")\",\nwith an immense storm and flood.[125][126] Huracan is also the source of the\nword _orcan_ , another word for a particularly strong [European\nwindstorm](/wiki/European_windstorm \"European windstorm\").[126]\n\n### Naming\n\nMain articles: [Tropical cyclone naming](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_naming\n\"Tropical cyclone naming\") and [History of tropical cyclone\nnaming](/wiki/History_of_tropical_cyclone_naming \"History of tropical cyclone\nnaming\")\n\nThe practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many\nyears, with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal\nstart of naming.[127][128] The system currently used provides positive\nidentification of severe weather systems in a brief form, that is readily\nunderstood and recognized by the public.[127][128] The credit for the first\nusage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the\n[Queensland Government](/wiki/Queensland_Government \"Queensland Government\")\nMeteorologist [Clement Wragge](/wiki/Clement_Wragge \"Clement Wragge\") who\nnamed systems between 1887 and 1907.[127][128] This system of naming weather\nsystems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired,\nuntil it was revived in the latter part of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II\n\"World War II\") for the Western Pacific.[127][128] Formal naming schemes have\nsubsequently been introduced for the [North and South Atlantic, Eastern,\nCentral, Western and Southern Pacific basins](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_basins\n\"Tropical cyclone basins\") as well as the [Australian\nregion](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_basins \"Tropical cyclone basins\") and [Indian\nOcean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian Ocean\").[128]\n\nAt present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven\nmeteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to\nprovide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public\nregarding forecasts, watches, and warnings.[127] Since the systems can last a\nweek or longer and more than one can be occurring in the same basin at the\nsame time, the names are thought to reduce the confusion about what storm is\nbeing described.[127] Names are assigned in order from predetermined\n[lists](/wiki/Lists_of_tropical_cyclone_names \"Lists of tropical cyclone\nnames\") with one, three, or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65\nkm/h (40 mph) depending on which basin it originates.[39][41][42] However,\nstandards vary from basin to basin with some tropical depressions named in the\nWestern Pacific, while tropical cyclones have to have a significant amount of\n[gale](/wiki/Gale \"Gale\")-force winds occurring around the center before they\nare named within the [Southern Hemisphere](/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere \"Southern\nHemisphere\").[42][43] The names of significant tropical cyclones in the North\nAtlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Australian region are retired from the\nnaming lists and replaced with another name.[39][40][43]\n\n## Notable tropical cyclones\n\nMain articles: [List of notable tropical\ncyclones](/wiki/List_of_notable_tropical_cyclones \"List of notable tropical\ncyclones\"), [List of Atlantic hurricanes](/wiki/List_of_Atlantic_hurricanes\n\"List of Atlantic hurricanes\"), and [List of Pacific\nhurricanes](/wiki/List_of_Pacific_hurricanes \"List of Pacific hurricanes\")\n\nTropical cyclones that cause extreme destruction are rare, although when they\noccur, they can cause great amounts of damage or thousands of fatalities. The\n[1970 Bhola cyclone](/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone \"1970 Bhola cyclone\") is the\ndeadliest tropical cyclone on record, killing more than 300,000 people[129]\nand potentially as many as 1 million[130] after striking the densely populated\n[Ganges Delta](/wiki/Ganges_Delta \"Ganges Delta\") region of\n[Bangladesh](/wiki/Bangladesh \"Bangladesh\") on November 13, 1970. Its powerful\nstorm surge was responsible for the high death toll.[129] The [North Indian\ncyclone basin](/wiki/List_of_North_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_seasons \"List of North\nIndian Ocean cyclone seasons\") has historically been the deadliest\nbasin.[97][131] Elsewhere, [Typhoon Nina](/wiki/Typhoon_Nina_\\(1975\\) \"Typhoon\nNina \\(1975\\)\") killed nearly 100,000 in China in 1975 due to a [100-year\nflood](/wiki/100-year_flood \"100-year flood\") that caused 62 dams including\nthe [Banqiao Dam](/wiki/Banqiao_Dam \"Banqiao Dam\") to fail.[132] The [Great\nHurricane of 1780](/wiki/Great_Hurricane_of_1780 \"Great Hurricane of 1780\") is\nthe deadliest [North Atlantic hurricane](/wiki/North_Atlantic_hurricane \"North\nAtlantic hurricane\") on record, killing about 22,000 people in the [Lesser\nAntilles](/wiki/Lesser_Antilles \"Lesser Antilles\").[133] A tropical cyclone\ndoes not need to be particularly strong to cause memorable damage, primarily\nif the deaths are from rainfall or mudslides.

The [Galveston Hurricane of\n1900](/wiki/Galveston_Hurricane_of_1900 \"Galveston Hurricane of 1900\") is the\ndeadliest natural disaster in the United States, killing an estimated 6,000 to\n12,000 people in [Galveston, Texas](/wiki/Galveston,_Texas \"Galveston,\nTexas\").[139] [Hurricane Mitch](/wiki/Hurricane_Mitch \"Hurricane Mitch\")\ncaused more than 10,000 fatalities in [Central America](/wiki/Central_America\n\"Central America\"), making it the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in\nhistory. [Hurricane Iniki](/wiki/Hurricane_Iniki \"Hurricane Iniki\") in 1992\nwas the most powerful storm to strike [Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii \"Hawaii\") in\nrecorded history, hitting [Kauai](/wiki/Kauai \"Kauai\") as a Category 4\nhurricane, killing six people, and causing U.S. $3 billion in damage.[140]\nKauai was also struck by Hurricanes Dot (1959) and Iwa (1982) (see [List of\nHawaii hurricanes](/wiki/List_of_Hawaii_hurricanes \"List of Hawaii\nhurricanes\")). Other destructive Eastern [Pacific\nhurricanes](/wiki/Pacific_hurricane \"Pacific hurricane\") include\n[Pauline](/wiki/Hurricane_Pauline \"Hurricane Pauline\") and\n[Kenna](/wiki/Hurricane_Kenna \"Hurricane Kenna\"), both causing severe damage\nafter striking [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\") as major hurricanes.[141][142]\nIn March 2004, [Cyclone Gafilo](/wiki/Cyclone_Gafilo \"Cyclone Gafilo\") struck\nnortheastern [Madagascar](/wiki/Madagascar \"Madagascar\") as a powerful\ncyclone, killing 74, affecting more than 200,000, and becoming the worst\ncyclone to affect the nation for more than 20 years.[143]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Typhoonsizes.jpg)](/wiki/File:Typhoonsizes.jpg)\n\nThe relative sizes of [Typhoon Tip](/wiki/Typhoon_Tip \"Typhoon Tip\"), [Cyclone\nTracy](/wiki/Cyclone_Tracy \"Cyclone Tracy\"), and the [Contiguous United\nStates](/wiki/Contiguous_United_States \"Contiguous United States\")\n\nThe most intense storm on record was [Typhoon Tip](/wiki/Typhoon_Tip \"Typhoon\nTip\") in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 1979, which reached a minimum\npressure of 870 hectopascals (25.69 inHg) and maximum sustained wind speeds of\n165 knots (85 m/s) or 190 miles per hour (310 km/h).[144] The highest maximum\nsustained wind speed ever recorded was 185 knots (95 m/s) or 215 miles per\nhour (345 km/h) in [Hurricane Patricia](/wiki/Hurricane_Patricia \"Hurricane\nPatricia\") in 2015, which is the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the\nWestern Hemisphere.[145] [Typhoon Nancy](/wiki/Typhoon_Nancy_\\(1961\\) \"Typhoon\nNancy \\(1961\\)\") in 1961 also had recorded wind speeds of 185 knots (95 m/s)\nor 215 miles per hour (346 km/h), but recent research indicates that wind\nspeeds from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high, and this is no longer\nconsidered the storm with the highest wind speeds on record.[122] Likewise, a\nsurface-level gust caused by [Typhoon Paka](/wiki/Typhoon_Paka \"Typhoon Paka\")\non [Guam](/wiki/Guam \"Guam\") in late 1997 was recorded at 205 knots (105 m/s)\nor 235 miles per hour (378 km/h). Had it been confirmed, it would be the\nstrongest non-[tornadic](/wiki/Tornado \"Tornado\") wind ever recorded on the\nEarth's surface, but the reading had to be discarded since the\n[anemometer](/wiki/Anemometer \"Anemometer\") was damaged by the storm.[146] The\n[World Meteorological Organization](/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization\n\"World Meteorological Organization\") established Barrow Island as the location\nof the highest non-tornado related wind gust at 408 km/h (253 mph).[147] The\ngust occurred on 10 April 1996, during [Severe Tropical Cyclone\nOlivia](/wiki/Cyclone_Olivia \"Cyclone Olivia\") and is documented in the\nAustralian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal.[148] In addition to being\nthe most intense tropical cyclone on record based on pressure, Tip was the\nlargest cyclone on record, with tropical storm-force winds 2,170 kilometres\n(1,350 mi) in diameter. The smallest storm on record, [Tropical Storm\nMarco](/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Marco_\\(2008\\) \"Tropical Storm Marco \\(2008\\)\"),\nformed during October 2008, and made landfall in [Veracruz](/wiki/Veracruz\n\"Veracruz\"). Marco generated tropical storm-force winds only 37 kilometres (23\nmi) in diameter.[149]\n\n[Hurricane John](/wiki/Hurricane_John_\\(1994\\) \"Hurricane John \\(1994\\)\") is\nthe longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, lasting 31 days in\n[1994](/wiki/1994_Pacific_hurricane_season \"1994 Pacific hurricane season\").\nBefore the advent of satellite imagery in 1961, however, many tropical\ncyclones were underestimated in their durations.[150] John is also the\nlongest-tracked tropical cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere on record, which\nhad a path of 8,250 mi (13,280 km).[151] [Cyclone Rewa](/wiki/Cyclone_Rewa\n\"Cyclone Rewa\") of the [1993–94 South\nPacific](/wiki/1993%E2%80%9394_South_Pacific_cyclone_season \"1993–94 South\nPacific cyclone season\") and [Australian\nregion](/wiki/1993%E2%80%9394_Australian_region_cyclone_season \"1993–94\nAustralian region cyclone season\") cyclone seasons had one of the longest\ntracks observed within the Southern Hemisphere, traveling a distance of over\n5,545 mi (8,920 km) during December 1993 and January 1994.[151]\n\n## Changes caused by El Niño–Southern Oscillation\n\nSee also: [El Niño–Southern\nOscillation](/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation \"El Niño–Southern\nOscillation\")\n\nMost tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the\n[equator](/wiki/Equator \"Equator\"), then move poleward past the ridge axis\nbefore recurving into the main belt of the [Westerlies](/wiki/Westerlies\n\"Westerlies\").[152] When the [subtropical ridge](/wiki/Subtropical_ridge\n\"Subtropical ridge\") position shifts due to El Niño, so will the preferred\ntropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of [Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\") and\n[Korea](/wiki/Korea \"Korea\") tend to experience much fewer September–November\ntropical cyclone impacts during [El Niño](/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o \"El Niño\") and\nneutral years. During El Niño years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends\nto lie near [130°E](/wiki/130th_meridian_east \"130th meridian east\") which\nwould favor the Japanese archipelago.[153] During El Niño years,\n[Guam](/wiki/Guam \"Guam\")'s chance of a tropical cyclone impact is one-third\nmore likely than of the long-term average.[154] The tropical Atlantic Ocean\nexperiences depressed activity due to increased vertical [wind\nshear](/wiki/Wind_shear \"Wind shear\") across the region during El Niño\nyears.[155] During [La Niña](/wiki/La_Ni%C3%B1a \"La Niña\") years, the\nformation of tropical cyclones, along with the subtropical ridge position,\nshifts westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall\nthreat to [China](/wiki/China \"China\") and much greater intensity in the\n[Philippines](/wiki/Philippines \"Philippines\").[153]\n\n## Long-term activity trends\n\nSee also: [Atlantic hurricane reanalysis](/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane_reanalysis\n\"Atlantic hurricane reanalysis\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/NOAA_ACE_index_1950-2004_RGB.svg/250px-\nNOAA_ACE_index_1950-2004_RGB.svg.png)](/wiki/File:NOAA_ACE_index_1950-2004_RGB.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:NOAA_ACE_index_1950-2004_RGB.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAtlantic Multidecadal Cycle since 1950, using [accumulated cyclone\nenergy](/wiki/Accumulated_cyclone_energy \"Accumulated cyclone energy\") (ACE)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Amo_timeseries_1856-present.svg/250px-\nAmo_timeseries_1856-present.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Amo_timeseries_1856-present.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Amo_timeseries_1856-present.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAtlantic Multidecadal Oscillation Timeseries, 1856–2013\n\nWhile the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995, there is\nno obvious global trend; the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide\nremains about 87 ± 10 (Between 77 and 97 tropical cyclones annually). However,\nthe ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain\nbasins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins,\nprimarily in the Southern Hemisphere,[156] while noting that a significant\ndownward trend in tropical cyclone numbers has been identified for the region\nnear Australia (based on high quality data and accounting for the influence of\nthe El Niño-Southern Oscillation).[157] In spite of that, there is some\nevidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. [Kerry\nEmanuel](/wiki/Kerry_Emanuel \"Kerry Emanuel\") stated, \"Records of hurricane\nactivity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the\nduration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again\nconsidering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in\nthe past 30 years or so, corresponding to about a 15% increase in the maximum\nwind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime.\"[158]\n\nAtlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially, as evidenced by the\nfact that five of the ten [most expensive storms in United States\nhistory](/wiki/List_of_costliest_Atlantic_hurricanes#Listed_by_cost_.28United_States_only.29\n\"List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes\") have occurred since 1990. According\nto the [World Meteorological\nOrganization](/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization \"World Meteorological\nOrganization\"), \"recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has\nbeen caused largely by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure\nin coastal regions.\"[159] Political scientist\n[Pielke](/wiki/Roger_A._Pielke_Jr. \"Roger A. Pielke Jr.\") _et al._ (2008)\nnormalized mainland US hurricane damage from 1900–2005 to 2005 values and\nfound no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s\nwere notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other\ndecades. The decade 1996–2005 was the second most damaging among the past 11\ndecades, with only the decade 1926–1935 surpassing its costs.\n\nOften in part because of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had\nsparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism;\ntherefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have\ngone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction\nand remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the\nofficial record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and\nsatellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the\nnumber and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early\ndata as suspect.[160]\n\nThe number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50–70 year cycle,\nalso known as the [Atlantic Multidecadal\nOscillation](/wiki/Atlantic_Multidecadal_Oscillation \"Atlantic Multidecadal\nOscillation\"). Nyberg _et al._ reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity\nback to the early 18th century and found five periods averaging 3–5 major\nhurricanes per year and lasting 40–60 years, and six other averaging 1.5–2.5\nmajor hurricanes per year and lasting 10–20 years. These periods are\nassociated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Throughout, a decadal\noscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for\nenhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1–2 per year.[161]\n\nAlthough more common since 1995, few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred\nduring 1970–94.[162] Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to\n1960, including many major [New England](/wiki/New_England \"New England\")\nhurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in\n[1933](/wiki/1933_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"1933 Atlantic hurricane season\"),\na record only recently exceeded in [2005](/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season\n\"2005 Atlantic hurricane season\"), which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes\noccurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900–25; however, many intense\nstorms formed during 1870–99. During the [1887\nseason](/wiki/1887_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"1887 Atlantic hurricane\nseason\"), 19 tropical storms formed, of which a record 4 occurred after\nNovember 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the\n1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an\n[1821 storm](/wiki/1821_Norfolk_and_Long_Island_hurricane \"1821 Norfolk and\nLong Island hurricane\") that made a direct hit on [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"). Some historical weather experts\nsay these storms may have been as high as [Category 4](/wiki/Saffir-\nSimpson_Hurricane_Scale \"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale\") in strength.[163]\n\nThese active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the Atlantic\nbasin. Before the satellite era began in 1960, tropical storms or hurricanes\nwent undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one, a ship\nreported a voyage through the storm, or a storm hit land in a populated\narea.[160]\n\nProxy records based on [paleotempestological](/wiki/Paleotempestology\n\"Paleotempestology\") research have revealed that major hurricane activity\nalong the [Gulf of Mexico](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of Mexico\") coast varies\non timescales of centuries to millennia.[164][165] Few major hurricanes struck\nthe Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent\nmillennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period\nduring 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by\ncatastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5\ntimes. This millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term\nshifts in the position of the [Azores High](/wiki/Azores_High \"Azores\nHigh\"),[165] which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the [North\nAtlantic oscillation](/wiki/North_Atlantic_oscillation \"North Atlantic\noscillation\").[166]\n\nAccording to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase pattern is expected to\nexist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the\nquiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would\nresult in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the\nhyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the\nAzores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean.\nSuch a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic\nevidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in [Haiti](/wiki/Haiti\n\"Haiti\") around 3200 [14C](/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating \"Radiocarbon dating\")\nyears BP,[167] and a change towards more humid conditions in the [Great\nPlains](/wiki/Great_Plains \"Great Plains\") during the late-Holocene as more\nmoisture was pumped up the [Mississippi Valley](/wiki/Mississippi_Valley\n\"Mississippi Valley\") through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the\nnorthern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A\n3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in [Cape Cod](/wiki/Cape_Cod \"Cape\nCod\") suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past\n500–1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last\nmillennium.\n\n## Climate change\n\nMain article: [Tropical cyclones and climate\nchange](/wiki/Tropical_cyclones_and_climate_change \"Tropical cyclones and\nclimate change\")\n\nThe 2007 [IPCC](/wiki/IPCC \"IPCC\") report noted many observed changes in the\nclimate, including atmospheric composition, global average temperatures, ocean\nconditions, and others. The report concluded the observed increase in tropical\ncyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict. In addition, the\nreport considered that it is likely that storm intensity will continue to\nincrease through the 21st century, and declared it more likely than not that\nthere has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone\nintensity.[168]\n\nP.J. Webster and others published in 2005 an article in\n_[Science](/wiki/Science_\\(journal\\) \"Science \\(journal\\)\")_ examining the\n\"changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity\" over the past 35\nyears, the period when satellite data has been available. Their main finding\nwas although the number of cyclones decreased throughout the planet excluding\nthe north [Atlantic Ocean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean \"Atlantic Ocean\"), there was a\ngreat increase in the number and proportion of very strong cyclones.[169]\n\nAccording to 2006 studies by the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration](/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration\n\"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\"), \"the strongest hurricanes\nin the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over\nthe next century as the earth's climate is warmed by increasing levels of\ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere\".[170]\n\nStudies published since 2008, by [Kerry Emanuel](/wiki/Kerry_Emanuel \"Kerry\nEmanuel\") from MIT, indicate that [global warming](/wiki/Global_warming\n\"Global warming\") is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the\nfrequency of hurricane and cyclone activity.[171] In an article in\n_[Nature](/wiki/Nature_\\(journal\\) \"Nature \\(journal\\)\")_ , Kerry Emanuel\nstated that potential hurricane destructiveness, a measure combining hurricane\nstrength, duration, and frequency, \"is highly correlated with tropical sea\nsurface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including\n[multidecadal oscillations](/wiki/Climate_oscillation \"Climate oscillation\")\nin the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming\". Emanuel\npredicted \"a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-\nfirst century\".[172]\n\nResearch reported in the September 3, 2008 issue of _Nature_ found that the\nstrongest tropical cyclones are getting stronger, in particular over the North\nAtlantic and Indian oceans. Wind speeds for the strongest tropical storms\nincreased from an average of 225 km/h (140 mph) in 1981 to 251 km/h (156 mph)\nin 2006, while the ocean temperature, averaged globally over all the regions\nwhere tropical cyclones form, increased from 28.2 °C (82.8 °F) to 28.5 °C\n(83.3 °F) during this period.[173][174]\n\nA 2017 study looked at compounding effects from floods, storm surge, and\nterrestrial flooding (rivers), and projects an increase [due to global\nwarming](/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming \"Effects of global\nwarming\").[175][176]\n\n## Related cyclone types\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Gustav_09_sep_2002_1805Z.jpg/250px-\nGustav_09_sep_2002_1805Z.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gustav_09_sep_2002_1805Z.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gustav_09_sep_2002_1805Z.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGustav on September 9, 2002, the first system to be given a name as a\nsubtropical cyclone\n\nSee also: [Cyclone](/wiki/Cyclone \"Cyclone\"), [Extratropical\ncyclone](/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone \"Extratropical cyclone\"), and\n[Subtropical cyclone](/wiki/Subtropical_cyclone \"Subtropical cyclone\")\n\nIn addition to tropical cyclones, there are two other classes of cyclones\nwithin the spectrum of cyclone types.

A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward\nhigher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by\ncondensation to differences in temperature between air masses; although not as\nfrequently, an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm,\nand from there into a tropical cyclone.[178] From space, extratropical storms\nhave a characteristic \"[comma](/wiki/Comma_\\(punctuation\\) \"Comma\n\\(punctuation\\)\")-shaped\" cloud pattern.[179] Extratropical cyclones can also\nbe dangerous when their low-pressure centers cause powerful winds and high\nseas.[180]\n\nA _subtropical cyclone_ is a [weather](/wiki/Weather \"Weather\") system that\nhas some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an\nextratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of\n[latitudes](/wiki/Latitude \"Latitude\"), from the [equator](/wiki/Equator\n\"Equator\") to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force\nwinds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm.[181] From an\noperational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become\nsubtropical during its extratropical transition.[182]\n\n## Popular culture\n\nMain article: [Tropical cyclones in popular\nculture](/wiki/Tropical_cyclones_in_popular_culture \"Tropical cyclones in\npopular culture\")\n\nIn [popular culture](/wiki/Popular_culture \"Popular culture\"), tropical\ncyclones have made several appearances in different types of media, including\nfilms, books, television, music, and [electronic games](/wiki/Electronic_game\n\"Electronic game\").[183] These media often portray tropical cyclones that are\neither entirely [fictional](/wiki/Fiction \"Fiction\") or based on real\nevents.[183] For example, [George Rippey Stewart](/wiki/George_Rippey_Stewart\n\"George Rippey Stewart\")'s _[Storm](/wiki/Storm_\\(novel\\) \"Storm \\(novel\\)\")_\n, a [best-seller](/wiki/Best-seller \"Best-seller\") published in 1941, is\nthought to have influenced meteorologists on their decision to assign female\nnames to Pacific tropical cyclones.[128] Another example is the hurricane in\n_[The Perfect Storm](/wiki/The_Perfect_Storm_\\(film\\) \"The Perfect Storm\n\\(film\\)\")_ , which describes the sinking of the _[Andrea\nGail](/wiki/Andrea_Gail \"Andrea Gail\")_ by the [1991 Perfect\nStorm](/wiki/1991_Perfect_Storm \"1991 Perfect Storm\").[184] Hypothetical\nhurricanes have been featured in parts of the plots of series such as _[The\nSimpsons](/wiki/Hurricane_Neddy \"Hurricane Neddy\")_ ,\n_[Invasion](/wiki/Invasion_\\(TV_series\\) \"Invasion \\(TV series\\)\")_ , _[Family\nGuy](/wiki/One_If_by_Clam,_Two_If_by_Sea \"One If by Clam, Two If by Sea\")_ ,\n_[Seinfeld](/wiki/The_Checks \"The Checks\")_ , _[Dawson's\nCreek](/wiki/Dawson%27s_Creek \"Dawson's

Day After\nTomorrow](/wiki/The_Day_After_Tomorrow \"The Day After Tomorrow\")_ includes\nseveral mentions of actual tropical cyclones and features fantastical\n\"hurricane-like\", albeit non-tropical, Arctic storms.[190][191]\n\n## See also\n\n  *
