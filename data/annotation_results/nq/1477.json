The use of\ncodes is intended to convey essential information quickly and with minimal\nmisunderstanding to staff while preventing stress and panic among visitors to\nthe hospital. Such codes are sometimes posted on placards throughout the\nhospital or are printed on employee identification badges for ready reference.\n\nHospital emergency codes have often varied widely by location, even between\nhospitals in the same community. Confusion over these codes has led to the\nproposal for and sometimes adoption of standardized codes. In many American,\nCanadian, New Zealand and Australian hospitals, for example \"code blue\"\nindicates a patient has entered [cardiac arrest](/wiki/Cardiac_arrest \"Cardiac\narrest\"), while \"code red\" indicates that a fire has broken out somewhere in\nthe hospital facility.\n\nIn order for a code call to be useful in activating the response of specific\nhospital personnel to a given situation, it is usually accompanied by a\nspecific location description (e.g., \"Code red, Second floor, corridor three,\nroom two-twelve\"). Other codes, however, only signal hospital staff generally\nto prepare for the fallout of some external event such as a natural disaster.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Color code standardization\n  * 2 Codes\n    * 2.1 Code Blue\n      * 2.1.1 Medical lockdown\n      * 2.1.2 Variations\n    * 2.2 \"Doctor\" Codes\n    * 2.3 \"Resus\" Codes\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Color code\nstandardization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hospital_emergency_codes&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Color code standardization\")]\n\n  * **[Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\")** : \n    * Australian hospitals and other buildings are covered by Australian Standard 4083 (1997) and many are in the process of changing to those standards.[1]\n      * Code Red: Fire\n      * Code Blue: Medical Emergency\n      * Code Yellow: Internal Emergency\n      * Code Brown: External Emergency (disaster, mass casualties etc.)\n      * Code Black: Personal Threat \n        * Code Black Alpha: Missing or Abducted Infant or Child\n        * Code Black Beta: Active Shooter\n        * Code Black J: Self-harm\n      * Code Purple: Bomb Threat\n      * Code Orange: Evacuation\n      * Code CBR: Chemical, Biological or Radiological Contamination\n  * **[Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\")** : \n    * Codes used in [British Columbia](/wiki/British_Columbia \"British Columbia\"), prescribed by the British Columbia Ministry of Health.[2]\n      * Code Red: Fire\n      * Code Blue: Cardiac Arrest\n      * Code Orange: Disaster or Mass Casualties\n      * Code Green: Evacuation\n      * Code Yellow: Missing Patient\n      * Code Amber: Missing or Abducted Infant or Child\n      * Code Black: Bomb Threat\n      * Code White: Aggression\n      * Code Brown: Hazardous Spill\n      * Code Grey: System Failure\n      * Code Pink: Pediatric Emergency and/or Obstetrical Emergency\n    * Codes in [Alberta](/wiki/Alberta \"Alberta\") are prescribed by [Alberta Health Services](/wiki/Alberta_Health_Services \"Alberta Health Services\").[3]\n      * Code Red: Fire\n      * Code Blue: Cardiac Arrest/Medical Emergency\n      * Code Orange: Mass Casualty Incident\n      * Code Green: Evacuation\n      * Code Yellow: Missing Patient\n      * Code Black: Bomb Threat/Suspicious Package\n      * Code White: Violence/Aggression\n      * Code Brown: Chemical Spill/Hazardous Material\n      * Code Grey: Shelter in Place/Air Exclusion\n      * Code Purple: Hostage Situation\n    * In [Ontario](/wiki/Ontario \"Ontario\"), a standard emergency response code set by the [Ontario Hospital Association](/wiki/Ontario_Hospital_Association \"Ontario Hospital Association\") is used, with minor variations for some hospitals.[4][5][6]\n      * Code Red: Fire\n      * Code Silver: Gun Threat/Shooter\n      * Code Blue: [Cardiac Arrest](/wiki/Cardiac_arrest \"Cardiac arrest\")/[Medical Emergency](/wiki/Medical_emergency \"Medical emergency\") – Adult\n      * Code Orange: Disaster \n        * Code Orange CBRN: [CBRN](/wiki/CBRN_defense \"CBRN defense\") (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) Disaster\n      * Code Green: Evacuation (Precautionary) \n        * Code Green STAT: Evacuation (Crisis)\n      * Code Yellow: Missing Person \n        * [Code Amber](/wiki/AMBER_Alert \"AMBER Alert\") (code purple): Missing Child/Child Abduction\n      * Code Black: [Bomb Threat](/wiki/Bomb_threat \"Bomb threat\")/Suspicious Object\n      * Code White: Violent/Behavioural Situation\n      * Code Brown: In-facility Hazardous Spill\n      * Code Grey: Infrastructure Loss or Failure \n        * Code Grey Button-down: External Air Exclusion\n      * Code Pink: Cardiac Arrest/Medical Emergency – Infant/Child\n      * Code Purple: Hostage Taking/Gang Activity\n      * Code Aqua: Flood\n  * **[United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\")** : \n    * In 2000, the Hospital Association of Southern California (HASC)[7][8][9] determined that a uniform code system is needed after \"three persons were killed in a shooting incident at an area medical center after the wrong emergency code was called.\" While codes for fire (red) and medical emergency (blue) were similar in 90% of California hospitals queried, 47 different codes were used for infant abduction and 61 for combative person. In light of this, HASC published a handbook titled \"Healthcare Facility Emergency Codes: A Guide for Code Standardization\" listing various codes and has strongly urged hospitals to voluntarily implement the revised codes.\n    * In 2003, [Maryland](/wiki/Maryland \"Maryland\") mandated that all acute hospitals in the state have uniform codes.[10]\n    * In 2008, the Oregon Association of Hospitals & Health Systems, Oregon Patient Safety Commission, and Washington State Hospital Association formed a taskforce to standardize emergency code calls under the leadership of the Dr. Lawrence Schecter, Chief Medical Officer, Providence Regional Medical Center Everett.[11] After both states had conducted a survey from all hospital members, the taskforce found many hospitals used the same code for fire (code Red); however, there were tremendous variations existed for codes representing respiratory and cardiac arrest, infant and child abduction, and combative person. After deliberations and decisions, the taskforce suggested the following as the Hospital Emergency Code:[12]\n      * **Code Blue** : Heart or Respiration Stops (An adult or child’s heart has stopped or they are not breathing.)\n      * **Code Red** : Fire (alternative: Massive Postpartum Hemorrhage)\n      * **Code Pink** : Infant abduction\n      * **Code Orange** : Hazardous Spills (A hazardous material spill or release; Unsafe exposure to spill.)\n      * **Code Silver** : Weapon or Hostage Situation\n      * **Code Grey** : Combative Person (Combative or abusive behavior by patients, families, visitors, staff or physicians) _If a weapon is involved “_ CODE SILVER _” should be called._\n      * **Amber Alert** : Infant/ Child Abduction\n      * **Internal Triage** : Internal Emergency (Internal emergency in multiple departments including: Bomb or bomb threat; Computer network down; Major plumbing problems; and Power or telephone outage.)\n      * **External Triage** : External Disaster (External emergencies impacting hospital including: Mass casualties; Severe weather; Massive power outages; and Nuclear, biological, and chemical accidents)\n      * **Rapid Response Team** : Medical Team Needed at Bedside (A patient’s medical condition is declining and needs an emergency medical team at the bedside) __Prior to heart or respiration stopping__\n      * **Code Clear** : Announced when emergency is over\n    * In 2015, the [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\") Hospital Association formed a work group to develop plain language standardization code recommendations. Abolishing all color codes was suggested.[13]\n\n##\nCodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hospital_emergency_codes&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Codes\")]\n\n**Note:** Different codes are used in different hospitals.\n\n### Code\nBlue[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hospital_emergency_codes&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Code Blue\")]\n\n\"Code blue\" redirects here. For other uses, see [Code\nBlue](/wiki/Code_Blue_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Code Blue \\(disambiguation\\)\").\n\n#### Medical\nlockdown[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hospital_emergency_codes&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Medical lockdown\")]\n\n\"Code Blue\" is generally used to indicate a patient requiring resuscitation or\nin need of immediate medical attention, most often as the result of a\n[respiratory arrest](/wiki/Respiratory_arrest \"Respiratory arrest\") or\n[cardiac arrest](/wiki/Cardiac_arrest \"Cardiac arrest\") (by cardiac arrest is\nnowadays considered to not just mean [asystole](/wiki/Asystole \"Asystole\"),\nthe most severe example, but also [pulseless electrical\nactivity](/wiki/Pulseless_electrical_activity \"Pulseless electrical activity\")\n[PEA], coarse or fine [ventricular\nfibrillation](/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation \"Ventricular fibrillation\") [VF\nor V-fib], or unstable irregular [ventricular\ntachycardia](/wiki/Ventricular_tachycardia \"Ventricular tachycardia\") [VT or\nV-tach]- some of these lethal, non-circulating arrhythmias are shockable by a\ndefibrillator, some are not and are primarily treated by epinephrine and\nsimilar drugs). When called overhead, the page takes the form of \"Code Blue,\n(floor), (room)\" to alert the resuscitation team where to respond. Every\nhospital, as a part of its disaster plans, sets a policy to determine which\nunits provide personnel for code coverage. In theory any medical professional\nmay respond to a code, but in practice the team makeup is limited to those\nwith [advanced cardiac life support](/wiki/Advanced_cardiac_life_support\n\"Advanced cardiac life support\") or other equivalent resuscitation training.\nFrequently these teams are staffed by physicians (from\n[anesthesia](/wiki/Anesthesia \"Anesthesia\") and [internal\nmedicine](/wiki/Internal_medicine \"Internal medicine\") in larger medical\ncenters or the [Emergency physician](/wiki/Emergency_physician \"Emergency\nphysician\") in smaller ones), [respiratory\ntherapists](/wiki/Respiratory_therapists \"Respiratory therapists\"),\npharmacists, and nurses. A code team leader will be a physician in attendance\non any code team; this individual is responsible for directing the\nresuscitation effort and is said to \"run the code\". This phrase was coined at\nBethany Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas.[14] The term \"code\" by itself\nis commonly used by medical professionals as a slang term for this type of\nemergency, as in \"calling a code\" or describing a patient in arrest as\n\"coding\" or \"coded\".\n\n  * Australian Standard[1]\n  * Californian Standard[7]\n\nIn some [hospitals](/wiki/Hospital \"Hospital\") or other medical facilities,\nthe resuscitation team may purposely respond slowly to a patient in cardiac\narrest, a practice known as \"[slow code](/wiki/Slow_code \"Slow code\")\", or may\nfake the response altogether for the sake of the patient's family, a practice\nknown as \"show code\".[15] Such practices are ethically controversial,[16] and\nare banned in some jurisdictions.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n####\nVariations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hospital_emergency_codes&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Variations\")]\n\n\"Plan Blue\" was used at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City to indicate\narrival of a trauma patient so critically injured that even the short delay of\na stop in the ER for evaluation could be fatal; the \"Plan Blue\" was called out\nto alert the surgeon on call to go immediately to the ER entrance and take the\npatient for immediate surgery. This was illustrated in an episode of _Trauma:\nLife in the ER_ , entitled \"West Side Stories\".\n\n### \"Doctor\"\nCodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hospital_emergency_codes&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: \"Doctor\" Codes\")]\n\n\"Doctor\" codes are often used in hospital settings for announcements over a\ngeneral loudspeaker or paging system that might cause panic or endanger a\npatient's privacy. Most often, \"Doctor\" codes take the form of \"Paging Dr.\nSinclair\", where the doctor's \"name\" is a code word for a dangerous situation\nor a patient in crisis, e.g.: \"Paging Doctor Firestone, third floor,\" to\nindicate a possible fire on the floor specified.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### \"Resus\"\nCodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hospital_emergency_codes&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: \"Resus\" Codes\")]\n\nSpecific to [emergency medicine](/wiki/Emergency_medicine \"Emergency\nmedicine\"), incoming patients in immediate danger of life or limb, whether\npresenting via [ambulance](/wiki/Ambulance \"Ambulance\") or walk-in\n[triage](/wiki/Triage \"Triage\"), are paged locally within the [emergency\ndepartment](/wiki/Emergency_department \"Emergency department\") as \"Resus\"\n[ri:səs] codes. These codes indicate the type of emergency (general medical,\ntrauma, cardiopulmonary or neurological) and type of patient (adult or\npediatric). An [estimated time of arrival](/wiki/Estimated_time_of_arrival\n\"Estimated time of arrival\") may be included, or \"now\" if the patient is\nalready in the department. The patient is transported to the nearest open\ntrauma bay or evaluation room, and is immediately attended by a designated\nteam of physicians and nurses for purposes of immediate stabilization and\ntreatment.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hospital_emergency_codes&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Inspector Sands](/wiki/Inspector_Sands \"Inspector Sands\"), code used over PA system in British public transport to indicate a serious situation\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hospital_emergency_codes&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [AS 4083-1997 Planning for emergencies-Health care facilities](http://www.saiglobal.com/PDFTemp/Previews/OSH/as/as4000/4000/4083.pdf)\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"BC Standardized Hospital Colour Codes\"](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/keeping-bc-healthy-safe/health-emergency-response/standardized-hospital-colour-codes.pdf) (PDF).
