Each body segment\nhas a pair of fleshy protrusions called [parapodia](/wiki/Parapodia\n\"Parapodia\") that bear many bristles, called [chaetae](/wiki/Chaeta \"Chaeta\"),\nwhich are made of [chitin](/wiki/Chitin \"Chitin\"). As such, polychaetes are\nsometimes referred to as **bristle worms**. More than 10,000 species are\ndescribed in this class. Common representatives include the\n[lugworm](/wiki/Lugworm \"Lugworm\") (_Arenicola marina_) and the\n[sandworm](/wiki/Alitta_virens \"Alitta virens\") or [clam worm](/wiki/Clam_worm\n\"Clam worm\") _Alitta_.\n\nPolychaetes as a class are robust and widespread, with species that live in\nthe coldest ocean temperatures of the [abyssal plain](/wiki/Abyssal_plain\n\"Abyssal plain\"), to forms which tolerate the extremely high temperatures near\n[hydrothermal vents](/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent \"Hydrothermal vent\"). Polychaetes\noccur throughout the Earth's oceans at all depths, from forms that live as\n[plankton](/wiki/Plankton \"Plankton\") near the surface, to a 2- to 3-cm\nspecimen (still unclassified) observed by the robot ocean probe\n[_Nereus_](/wiki/Nereus_\\(underwater_vehicle\\) \"Nereus \\(underwater\nvehicle\\)\") at the bottom of the [Challenger Deep](/wiki/Challenger_Deep\n\"Challenger Deep\"), the deepest known spot in the Earth's oceans.[2] Only 168\nspecies (less than 2% of all polychaetes) are known from fresh waters.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Description\n    * 1.1 Internal anatomy and physiology\n  * 2 Ecology\n  * 3 Reproduction\n  * 4 Fossil record\n  * 5 Taxonomy and systematics\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n    * 7.1 Bibliography\n    * 7.2 Notes\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Description[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Polychaete&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Description\")]\n\nPolychaetes are segmented worms, generally less than 10 cm (4 in) in length,\nalthough ranging at the extremes from 1 mm (0.04 in) to 3 m (10 ft), in\n_[Eunice aphroditois](/wiki/Eunice_aphroditois \"Eunice aphroditois\")_. They\ncan sometimes be brightly coloured, and may be [iridescent](/wiki/Iridescent\n\"Iridescent\") or even [luminescent](/wiki/Luminescent \"Luminescent\"). Each\nsegment bears a pair of paddle-like and highly vascularized\n[parapodia](/wiki/Parapodia \"Parapodia\"), which are used for movement and, in\nmany species, act as the worm's primary [respiratory](/wiki/Gas_exchange \"Gas\nexchange\") surfaces. Bundles of bristles, called [setae](/wiki/Setae \"Setae\"),\nproject from the parapodia.[4]\n\nHowever, polychaetes vary widely from this generalised pattern, and can\ndisplay a range of different body forms. The most generalised polychaetes are\nthose that crawl along the bottom, but others have adapted to many different\n[ecological niches](/wiki/Ecological_niche \"Ecological niche\"), including\nburrowing, swimming, [pelagic](/wiki/Pelagic \"Pelagic\") life, tube-dwelling or\nboring, [commensalism](/wiki/Commensal \"Commensal\"), and\n[parasitism](/wiki/Parasite \"Parasite\"), requiring various modifications to\ntheir body structures.\n\nThe head, or [prostomium](/wiki/Prostomium \"Prostomium\"), is relatively well\ndeveloped, compared with other annelids. It projects forward over the mouth,\nwhich therefore lies on the animal's underside. The head normally includes two\nto four pair of eyes, although some species are blind. These are typically\nfairly simple structures, capable of distinguishing only light and dark,\nalthough some species have large eyes with lenses that may be capable of more\nsophisticated vision.[4]\n\nThe head also includes a pair of [antennae](/wiki/Antenna_\\(biology\\) \"Antenna\n\\(biology\\)\"), tentacle-like [palps](/wiki/Palp \"Palp\"), and a pair of pits\nlined with [cilia](/wiki/Cilia \"Cilia\"), known as \"nuchal organs\". These\nlatter appear to be [chemoreceptors](/wiki/Chemoreceptor \"Chemoreceptor\"), and\nhelp the worm to seek out food.[4]\n\n### Internal anatomy and\nphysiology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Polychaete&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Internal anatomy and physiology\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Polychaeta_anatomy_en.svg/500px-\nPolychaeta_anatomy_en.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Polychaeta_anatomy_en.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Polychaeta_anatomy_en.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGeneral anatomy of a polychaete\n\nThe outer surface of the body wall consists of a simple [columnar\nepithelium](/wiki/Columnar_epithelium \"Columnar epithelium\") covered by a thin\n[cuticle](/wiki/Cuticle \"Cuticle\"). Underneath this, in order, are a thin\nlayer of connective tissue, a layer of circular muscle, a layer of\nlongitudinal muscle, and a [peritoneum](/wiki/Peritoneum \"Peritoneum\")\nsurrounding the [body cavity](/wiki/Coelom \"Coelom\"). Additional oblique\nmuscles move the parapodia. In most species the body cavity is divided into\nseparate compartments by sheets of peritoneum between each segment, but in\nsome species it's more continuous.\n\nThe mouth of polychaetes is located on the [peristomium](/wiki/Peristomium\n\"Peristomium\"), the segment behind the [prostomium](/wiki/Prostomium\n\"Prostomium\"), and varies in form depending on their diets, since the group\nincludes predators, herbivores, filter feeders, scavengers, and parasites. In\ngeneral, however, they possess a pair of jaws and a [pharynx](/wiki/Pharynx\n\"Pharynx\") that can be rapidly everted, allowing the worms to grab food and\npull it into their mouths. In some species, the pharynx is modified into a\nlengthy [proboscis](/wiki/Proboscis \"Proboscis\"). The digestive tract is a\nsimple tube, usually with a stomach part way along.\n\nThe smallest species, and those adapted to burrowing, lack [gills](/wiki/Gill\n\"Gill\"), breathing only through their body surfaces. Most other species have\nexternal gills, often associated with the parapodia.\n\nA simple but well-developed circulatory system is usually present. The two\nmain blood vessels furnish smaller vessels to supply the parapodia and the\ngut. Blood flows forward in the dorsal vessel, above the gut, and returns down\nthe body in the ventral vessel, beneath the gut. The blood vessels themselves\nare contractile, helping to push the blood along, so most species have no need\nof a heart. In a few cases, however, muscular pumps analogous to a heart are\nfound in various parts of the system. Conversely, some species have little or\nno circulatory system at all, transporting oxygen in the [coelomic\nfluid](/wiki/Coelom#Coelomic_fluid \"Coelom\") that fills their body\ncavities.[4]\n\nThe blood may be colourless, or have any of three different respiratory\npigments. The most common of these is [haemoglobin](/wiki/Haemoglobin\n\"Haemoglobin\"), but some groups have [haemerythrin](/wiki/Haemerythrin\n\"Haemerythrin\") or the green-coloured [chlorocruorin](/wiki/Chlorocruorin\n\"Chlorocruorin\"), instead.\n\nThe nervous system consists of a single or double ventral nerve cord running\nthe length of the body, with [ganglia](/wiki/Ganglion \"Ganglion\") and a series\nof small nerves in each segment. The brain is relatively large, compared with\nthat of other annelids, and lies in the upper part of the head. An\n[endocrine](/wiki/Endocrine \"Endocrine\") gland is attached to the ventral\nposterior surface of the brain, and appears to be involved in reproductive\nactivity. In addition to the sensory organs on the head, photosensitive eye\nspots, [statocysts](/wiki/Statocyst \"Statocyst\"), and numerous additional\nsensory nerve endings, most likely in involved with the sense of touch, also\noccur on the body.[4]\n\nPolychaetes have a varying number of [protonephridia](/wiki/Protonephridia\n\"Protonephridia\") or [metanephridia](/wiki/Metanephridia \"Metanephridia\") for\nexcreting waste, which in some cases can be relatively complex in structure.\nThe body also contains greenish \"chloragogen\" tissue, similar to that found in\n[oligochaetes](/wiki/Oligochaete \"Oligochaete\"), which appears to function in\nmetabolism, in a similar fashion to that of the vertebrate [liver](/wiki/Liver\n\"Liver\").[4]\n\nThe cuticle is constructed from cross-linked fibres of\n[collagen](/wiki/Collagen \"Collagen\") and may be 200 nm to 13 mm thick. Their\njaws are formed from [sclerotised](/wiki/Sclerite \"Sclerite\") collagen, and\ntheir [setae](/wiki/Setae \"Setae\") from sclerotised [chitin](/wiki/Chitin\n\"Chitin\").[5]\n\n## Ecology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Polychaete&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Ecology\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Spirobrancheus_giganteus.jpg/220px-\nSpirobrancheus_giganteus.jpg)](/wiki/File:Spirobrancheus_giganteus.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Spirobrancheus_giganteus.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nChristmas tree worms (_[Spirobranchus giganteus](/wiki/Spirobranchus_giganteus\n\"Spirobranchus giganteus\")_) from [East Timor](/wiki/East_Timor \"East Timor\").\n\nPolychaetes are extremely variable in both form and lifestyle, and include a\nfew taxa that swim among the [plankton](/wiki/Plankton \"Plankton\") or above\nthe [abyssal plain](/wiki/Abyssal_plain \"Abyssal plain\"). Most burrow or build\ntubes in the sediment, and some live as [commensals](/wiki/Commensal\n\"Commensal\"). A few are parasitic. The mobile forms (Errantia) tend to have\nwell-developed sense organs and jaws, while the stationary forms (Sedentaria)\nlack them, but may have specialized gills or tentacles used for respiration\nand deposit or filter feeding, e.g., [fanworms](/wiki/Fanworm \"Fanworm\").\n\nUnderwater polychaetes have eversible mouthparts used to capture prey.[6] A\nfew groups have evolved to live in terrestrial environments, like\n[Namanereidinae](/w/index.php?title=Namanereidinae&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Namanereidinae \\(page does not exist\\)\") with many terrestrial species, but\nare restricted to humid areas. Some have even evolved cutaneous invaginations\nfor aerial gas exchange.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Featherduster_300.jpg/220px-\nFeatherduster_300.jpg)](/wiki/File:Featherduster_300.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Featherduster_300.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[Sabellastarte spectabilis](/wiki/Sabellastarte_spectabilis \"Sabellastarte\nspectabilis\")_\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Tomopteriskils.jpg/220px-\nTomopteriskils.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tomopteriskils.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tomopteriskils.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[Tomopteris](/wiki/Tomopteris \"Tomopteris\")_ from [plankton](/wiki/Plankton\n\"Plankton\")\n\nNotable polychaetes\n\n  * One notable polychaete, the [Pompeii worm](/wiki/Pompeii_worm \"Pompeii worm\") (_Alvinella pompejana_) is endemic to the [hydrothermal vents](/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent \"Hydrothermal vent\") of the Pacific Ocean. Pompeii worms are among the most heat-tolerant complex animals known.\n  * A recently discovered genus, _[Osedax](/wiki/Osedax \"Osedax\")_ , includes a species nicknamed the \"bone-eating snot flower\".[7]\n  * Another remarkable polychaete is _[Hesiocaeca methanicola](/wiki/Hesiocaeca_methanicola \"Hesiocaeca methanicola\")_ , which lives on [methane clathrate](/wiki/Methane_clathrate \"Methane clathrate\") deposits.\n  * _[Lamellibrachia](/wiki/Lamellibrachia \"Lamellibrachia\") luymesi_ is a [cold seep](/wiki/Cold_seep \"Cold seep\") [tube worm](/wiki/Tube_worm_\\(body_plan\\) \"Tube worm \\(body plan\\)\") that reaches lengths of over 3 m and may be the most long-lived animal, being over 250 years old.\n  * A still unclassified multilegged predatory polychaete worm was identified only by observation from the underwater vehicle [_Nereus_](/wiki/Nereus_\\(underwater_vehicle\\) \"Nereus \\(underwater vehicle\\)\") at the bottom of the [Challenger Deep](/wiki/Challenger_Deep \"Challenger Deep\"), the greatest depth in the oceans, near 10,902 m (35,768 ft) in depth. It was about an inch long visually, but the probe failed to capture it, so it could not be studied in detail.[8]\n  * The Bobbit worm (_[Eunice aphroditois](/wiki/Eunice_aphroditois \"Eunice aphroditois\")_) is a predatory species that can achieve a length at 3 m (9.8 feet), with an average diameter of 25 mm (0.98 in).\n\n## Reproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Polychaete&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Reproduction\")]\n\nMost polychaetes have separate sexes, rather than being hermaphroditic. The\nmost primitive species have a pair of [gonads](/wiki/Gonad \"Gonad\") in every\nsegment, but most species exhibit some degree of specialisation. The gonads\nshed immature [gametes](/wiki/Gamete \"Gamete\") directly into the body cavity,\nwhere they complete their development. Once mature, the gametes are shed into\nthe surrounding water through ducts or openings that vary between species, or\nin some cases by the complete rupture of the body wall (and subsequent death\nof the adult). A few species [copulate](/wiki/Animal_sexual_behavior \"Animal\nsexual behavior\"), but most fertilize their eggs externally.\n\nThe fertilized eggs typically hatch into [trochophore](/wiki/Trochophore\n\"Trochophore\") larvae, which float among the [plankton](/wiki/Plankton\n\"Plankton\"), and eventually [metamorphose](/wiki/Metamorphosis\n\"Metamorphosis\") into the adult form by adding segments. A few species have no\nlarval form, with the egg hatching into a form resembling the adult, and in\nmany that do have larvae, the trochophore never feeds, surviving off the yolk\nthat remains from the egg.[4]\n\nSome polychaetes exhibit remarkable reproductive strategies. Some species in\nthe genus _Eunicie_ reproduce by [epitoky](/wiki/Epitoky \"Epitoky\"). For much\nof the year, these worms look like any other burrow-dwelling polychaete, but\nas the breeding season approaches, the worm undergoes a remarkable\ntransformation as new, specialized segments begin to grow from its rear end\nuntil the worm can be clearly divided into two halves. The front half, the\natoke, is asexual. The new rear half, responsible for breeding, is known as\nthe epitoke. Each of the epitoke segments is packed with eggs and sperm and\nfeatures a single eyespot on its surface. The beginning of the last lunar\nquarter is the cue for these animals to breed, and the epitokes break free\nfrom the atokes and float to the surface. The eye spots sense when the epitoke\nreaches the surface and the segments from millions of worms burst, releasing\ntheir eggs and sperm into the water.[9]\n\nAnother strange strategy is employed by the deep sea worm _[Syllis\nramosa](/wiki/Syllis_ramosa \"Syllis ramosa\")_ which lives inside a sponge. The\nrear end of the worm develops into a \"stolon\" containing the eggs or sperm,\nand this stolon becomes detached from the parent worm, and rises to the sea\nsurface where fertilisation takes place.[10]\n\n## Fossil record[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Polychaete&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Fossil record\")]\n\nStem-group polychaete fossils are known from the [Sirius\nPasset](/wiki/Sirius_Passet \"Sirius Passet\")\n[Lagerstätte](/wiki/Lagerst%C3%A4tte \"Lagerstätte\"), a rich, sedimentary\ndeposit in Greenland tentatively dated to the late\n[Atdabanian](/wiki/Atdabanian \"Atdabanian\") (early [Cambrian](/wiki/Cambrian\n\"Cambrian\")).[11] Many of the more famous [Burgess Shale](/wiki/Burgess_Shale\n\"Burgess Shale\") organisms, such as _[Canadia](/wiki/Canadia_\\(genus\\)\n\"Canadia \\(genus\\)\")_ , may also have polychaete affinities.\n_[Wiwaxia](/wiki/Wiwaxia \"Wiwaxia\")_ , long interpreted as an annelid,[12] is\nnow considered to represent a mollusc.[13][14] An even older fossil,\n_[Cloudina](/wiki/Cloudina \"Cloudina\")_ , dates to the terminal\n[Ediacaran](/wiki/Ediacaran \"Ediacaran\") period; this has been interpreted as\nan early polychaete, although consensus is absent.[15][16]\n\nBeing [soft-bodied organisms](/wiki/Soft-bodied_organisms \"Soft-bodied\norganisms\"), the fossil record of polychaetes is dominated by their fossilized\njaws, known as [scolecodonts](/wiki/Scolecodont \"Scolecodont\"), and the\n[mineralized](/wiki/Mineral \"Mineral\") tubes that some of them secrete.[17]\nMost important [biomineralising polychaetes](/wiki/Biomineralising_polychaetes\n\"Biomineralising polychaetes\") are [serpulids](/wiki/Serpulidae \"Serpulidae\"),\n[sabellids](/wiki/Sabellidae \"Sabellidae\"), and\n[cirratulids](/wiki/Cirratulidae \"Cirratulidae\"). Polychaete cuticle does have\nsome preservation potential; it tends to survive for at least 30 days after a\npolychaete's death.[5] Although biomineralisation is usually necessary to\npreserve soft tissue after this time, the presence of polychaete muscle in the\nnonmineralised Burgess shale shows this need not always be the case.[5] Their\npreservation potential is similar to that of [jellyfish](/wiki/Jellyfish\n\"Jellyfish\").[5]\n\n## Taxonomy and\nsystematics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Polychaete&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Taxonomy and systematics\")]\n\nSee also: [List of Annelid families](/wiki/List_of_Annelid_families \"List of\nAnnelid families\")\n\nTaxonomically, polychaetes are thought to be [paraphyletic](/wiki/Paraphyletic\n\"Paraphyletic\"),[18] meaning the group excludes some descendants of its most\nrecent common ancestor. Groups that may be descended from the polychaetes\ninclude the [oligochaetes](/wiki/Oligochaetes \"Oligochaetes\")\n([earthworms](/wiki/Earthworm \"Earthworm\") and [leeches](/wiki/Leech\n\"Leech\")), [sipunculans](/wiki/Sipuncula \"Sipuncula\"), and\n[echiurans](/wiki/Echiura \"Echiura\"). The Pogonophora and\n[Vestimentifera](/wiki/Vestimentifera \"Vestimentifera\") were once considered\nseparate phyla, but are now classified in the polychaete family\n[Siboglinidae](/wiki/Siboglinidae \"Siboglinidae\").\n\nMuch of the classification below matches Rouse & Fauchald, 1998, although that\npaper does not apply ranks above family.\n\nOlder classifications recognize many more (sub)orders than the layout\npresented here. As comparatively few polychaete [taxa](/wiki/Taxa \"Taxa\") have\nbeen subject to [cladistic](/wiki/Cladistic \"Cladistic\") analysis, some groups\nwhich are usually considered invalid today may eventually be reinstated.\n\nThese divisions were shown to be mostly paraphyletic in recent years.\n\n  * **[Basal](/wiki/Basal_\\(evolution\\) \"Basal \\(evolution\\)\") or _[incertae
