Congress debated and revised the wording of the\nDeclaration, finally approving it two days later on July 4. A day earlier,\n[John Adams](/wiki/John_Adams \"John Adams\") had written to his wife\n[Abigail](/wiki/Abigail_Adams \"Abigail Adams\"):\n\n> The second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the\n> history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by\n> succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be\n> commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God\n> Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games,\n> sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this\n> continent to the other, from this time forward forever more.[7]\n\nAdams's prediction was off by two days. From the outset, Americans celebrated\nindependence on July 4, the date shown on the much-publicized Declaration of\nIndependence, rather than on July 2, the date the resolution of independence\nwas approved in a closed session of Congress.[8]\n\nHistorians have long disputed whether members of Congress signed the\nDeclaration of Independence on July 4, even though Thomas Jefferson, John\nAdams, and [Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin Franklin\")\nall later wrote that they had signed it on that day. Most historians have\nconcluded that the Declaration was signed nearly a month after its adoption,\non August 2, 1776, and not on July 4 as is commonly\nbelieved.[9][10][11][12][13]\n\nCoincidentally, both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the only signers of the\nDeclaration of Independence later to serve as [Presidents of the United\nStates](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\"), died on the same day: July 4, 1826, which was the 50th anniversary\nof the Declaration.[14] Although not a signer of the Declaration of\nIndependence, [James Monroe](/wiki/James_Monroe \"James Monroe\"), another\n[Founding Father](/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States \"Founding\nFathers of the United States\") who was elected as President, also died on July\n4, 1831. He was the third President who died on the anniversary of\nindependence.[15] [Calvin Coolidge](/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge \"Calvin Coolidge\"),\nthe 30th President, was born on July 4, 1872; so far he is the only U.S.\nPresident to have been born on Independence Day.[16]\n\n## Observance\n\n  * In 1777, thirteen [gunshots](/wiki/Gunshot \"Gunshot\") were fired in salute, once at morning and once again as evening fell, on July 4 in [Bristol, Rhode Island](/wiki/Bristol,_Rhode_Island \"Bristol, Rhode Island\"). An article in July 18, 1777 issue of _[The Virginia Gazette](/wiki/The_Virginia_Gazette \"The Virginia Gazette\")_ noted a celebration in Philadelphia in a manner a modern American would find familiar: an official dinner for the Continental Congress, toasts, [13-gun salutes](/wiki/Saluting_guns \"Saluting guns\"), speeches, prayers, music, parades, troop reviews, and fireworks. Ships in port were decked with red, white, and blue bunting.[17]\n  * In 1778, from his headquarters at [Ross Hall](/wiki/Ross_Hall \"Ross Hall\"), near [New Brunswick, New Jersey](/wiki/New_Brunswick,_New_Jersey \"New Brunswick, New Jersey\"), General [George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\") marked July 4 with a double ration of [rum](/wiki/Rum \"Rum\") for his soldiers and an artillery salute (_[feu de joie](/wiki/Feu_de_joie \"Feu de joie\")_).

The town claims to be the first public July 4 event, as it was carefully documented by the [Moravian Church](/wiki/Moravian_Church \"Moravian Church\"), and there are no government records of any earlier celebrations.[19]\n  * In 1870, the [U.S. Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") made Independence Day an unpaid holiday for federal employees.[20]\n  * In 1938, Congress changed Independence Day to a paid federal holiday.[21]\n\n## Customs\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/InvitationIndependenceDayGreenwichCT06201825.jpg/290px-\nInvitationIndependenceDayGreenwichCT06201825.jpg)](/wiki/File:InvitationIndependenceDayGreenwichCT06201825.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:InvitationIndependenceDayGreenwichCT06201825.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn 1825 invitation to an Independence Day celebration\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Firework_in_sky.jpg/220px-\nFirework_in_sky.jpg)](/wiki/File:Firework_in_sky.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Firework_in_sky.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFireworks on Independence Day in [Goleta, California](/wiki/Goleta,_California\n\"Goleta, California\")\n\nIndependence Day is a [national holiday](/wiki/National_Day \"National Day\")\nmarked by patriotic displays. Similar to other summer-themed events,\nIndependence Day celebrations often take place outdoors. According to [5\nU.S.C.](/wiki/Title_5_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 5 of the United States\nCode\") [§ 6103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/6103), Independence\nDay is a federal holiday, so all non-essential federal institutions (such as\nthe [postal service](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service \"United States Postal\nService\") and [federal courts](/wiki/United_States_federal_courts \"United\nStates federal courts\")) are closed on that day. Many politicians make it a\npoint on this day to appear at a public event to praise the nation's heritage,\nlaws, history, society, and people.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nFamilies often celebrate Independence Day by hosting or attending a picnic or\nbarbecue; many take advantage of the day off and, in some years, a long\nweekend to gather with relatives or friends. Decorations (_e.g._ , streamers,\nballoons, and clothing) are generally colored red, white, and blue, the colors\nof the [American flag](/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States \"Flag of the United\nStates\"). Parades are often held in the morning, before family get-togethers,\nwhile fireworks displays occur in the evening after dark at such places as\nparks, fairgrounds, or town squares.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe night before the Fourth was once the focal point of celebrations, marked\nby raucous gatherings often incorporating [bonfires](/wiki/Bonfires\n\"Bonfires\") as their centerpiece. In [New England](/wiki/New_England \"New\nEngland\"), towns competed to build towering pyramids, assembled from barrels\nand casks. They were lit at nightfall to usher in the celebration. The highest\nwere in [Salem, Massachusetts](/wiki/Salem,_Massachusetts \"Salem,\nMassachusetts\"), with pyramids composed of as many as forty tiers of barrels.\nThese made the tallest bonfires ever recorded. The custom flourished in the\n19th and 20th centuries and is still practiced in some [New\nEngland](/wiki/New_England \"New England\") towns.[22]\n\nIndependence Day [fireworks](/wiki/Fireworks \"Fireworks\") are often\naccompanied by patriotic songs such as the [national\nanthem](/wiki/National_anthem \"National anthem\"), \"[The Star-Spangled\nBanner](/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner \"The Star-Spangled Banner\")\"; \"[God\nBless America](/wiki/God_Bless_America \"God Bless America\")\"; \"[America the\nBeautiful](/wiki/America_the_Beautiful \"America the Beautiful\")\"; \"[My\nCountry, 'Tis of Thee](/wiki/My_Country,_%27Tis_of_Thee \"My Country, 'Tis of\nThee\")\"; \"[This Land Is Your Land](/wiki/This_Land_Is_Your_Land \"This Land Is\nYour Land\")\"; \"[Stars and Stripes Forever](/wiki/Stars_and_Stripes_Forever\n\"Stars and Stripes Forever\")\"; and, regionally, \"[Yankee\nDoodle](/wiki/Yankee_Doodle \"Yankee Doodle\")\" in northeastern states and\n\"[Dixie](/wiki/Dixie_\\(song\\) \"Dixie \\(song\\)\")\" in southern states.

Safety concerns have led\nsome states to ban fireworks or limit the sizes and types allowed. In\naddition, local and regional weather conditions may dictate whether the sale\nor use of fireworks in an area will be allowed. Some local or regional\nfirework sales are limited or prohibited because of dry weather or other\nspecific concerns. On these occasions the public may be prohibited from\npurchasing or discharging fireworks, but professional displays (such as those\nat sports events) may still take place, if certain safety precautions have\nbeen taken.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nA salute of one gun for each state in the United States, called a \"salute to\nthe union,\" is fired on Independence Day at noon by any capable military\nbase.[23]\n\nNew York City has the largest fireworks display in the country, with more than\n22 tons of pyrotechnics exploded in 2009.[24] It generally holds displays in\nthe East River.
