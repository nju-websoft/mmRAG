Crowded between the\ncollagen fibers are rows of [fibroblasts](/wiki/Fibroblast \"Fibroblast\"),\nfiber-forming cells, that generate the fibers. Dense connective tissue forms\nstrong, rope-like structures such as [tendons](/wiki/Tendon \"Tendon\") and\n[ligaments](/wiki/Ligament \"Ligament\"). Tendons attach [skeletal\nmuscles](/wiki/Skeletal_muscle \"Skeletal muscle\") to [bones](/wiki/Bone\n\"Bone\"); ligaments connect bones to bones at [joints](/wiki/Joint \"Joint\").\nLigaments are more stretchy and contain more [elastic\nfibers](/wiki/Elastic_fiber \"Elastic fiber\") than tendons. Dense connective\ntissue also make up the lower layers of the [skin](/wiki/Skin \"Skin\")\n(dermis), where it is arranged in sheets.[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Classification\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n##\nClassification[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dense_connective_tissue&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Classification\")]\n\nIt is often divided into \"[Dense regular connective\ntissue](/wiki/Dense_regular_connective_tissue \"Dense regular connective\ntissue\")\" and \"[Dense irregular connective\ntissue](/wiki/Dense_irregular_connective_tissue \"Dense irregular connective\ntissue\")\".[3]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dense_connective_tissue&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Loose connective tissue](/wiki/Loose_connective_tissue \"Loose connective tissue\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dense_connective_tissue&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Blue Histology\"](http://www.lab.anhb.uwa.edu.au/mb140/).
