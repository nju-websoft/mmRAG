Cricketing authorities were looking to boost the game's popularity with\nthe younger generation in response to dwindling crowds and reduced\nsponsorship. It was intended to deliver fast-paced, exciting cricket\naccessible to thousands of fans who were put off by the longer versions of the\ngame. Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, proposed a 20 over\nper innings game to county chairmen in 2001 and they voted 11–7 in favour of\nadopting the new format.[6]\n\nRegional tournaments\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/2007t20.jpg/280px-2007t20.jpg)](/wiki/File:2007t20.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:2007t20.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBangladesh V South Africa at the 2007 tournament\n\nThe first official Twenty20 matches were played on 13 June 2003 between the\nEnglish counties in the [Twenty20 Cup](/wiki/Twenty20_Cup \"Twenty20 Cup\").[7]\nThe first season of Twenty20 in England was a relative success, with the\n[Surrey Lions](/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club \"Surrey County Cricket Club\")\ndefeating the [Warwickshire Bears](/wiki/Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club\n\"Warwickshire County Cricket Club\") by 9 wickets in the final to claim the\ntitle.[8] The first Twenty20 match held at [Lord's](/wiki/Lord%27s \"Lord's\"),\non 15 July 2004 between [Middlesex](/wiki/Middlesex_County_Cricket_Club\n\"Middlesex County Cricket Club\") and [Surrey](/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club\n\"Surrey County Cricket Club\"), attracted a crowd of 27,509, the largest\nattendance for any [county cricket](/wiki/County_cricket \"County cricket\")\ngame at the ground other than a one-day final since 1953.[9]\n\nSoon after with the adoption of Twenty20 matches by other cricket boards, the\npopularity of the format grew with unexpected crowd attendance, new regional\ntournaments such as Pakistan's [Faysal Bank T20 Cup](/wiki/Faysal_Bank_T20_Cup\n\"Faysal Bank T20 Cup\") and [Stanford 20/20](/wiki/Stanford_20/20 \"Stanford\n20/20\") tournament and the financial incentive in the format.\n\nThe West Indies regional teams competed in what was named the [Stanford\n20/20](/wiki/Stanford_20/20 \"Stanford 20/20\") tournament. The event was\nfinancially backed by convicted fraudster [Allen\nStanford](/wiki/Allen_Stanford \"Allen Stanford\"), who gave at least\nUS$28,000,000 funding money, the fruit of his massive Ponzi scheme. It was\nintended that the tournament would be an annual event.\n[Guyana](/wiki/Guyanese_cricket_team \"Guyanese cricket team\") won the\ninaugural event, defeating [Trinidad and\nTobago](/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_cricket_team \"Trinidad and Tobago cricket\nteam\") by 5 wickets, securing US$1,000,000 in prize money.[10][11] A spin-off\ntournament, the [Stanford Super Series](/wiki/Stanford_Super_Series \"Stanford\nSuper Series\"), was held in October 2008 between\n[Middlesex](/wiki/Middlesex_County_Cricket_Club \"Middlesex County Cricket\nClub\") and [Trinidad and\nTobago](/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_national_cricket_team \"Trinidad and Tobago\nnational cricket team\"), the respective winners of the English and Caribbean\nTwenty20 competitions, and a [Stanford Superstars](/wiki/Stanford_Superstars\n\"Stanford Superstars\") team formed from West Indies domestic players; Trinidad\nand Tobago won the competition, securing US$280,000 prize money.[12][13] On 1\nNovember, the Stanford Superstars played England in what was expected to be\nthe first of five fixtures in as many years with the winner claiming a\nUS$20,000,000 in each match.[14][15]\n\nTwenty20 Internationals\n\nMain article: [Twenty20 International](/wiki/Twenty20_International \"Twenty20\nInternational\")\n\nOn 17 February 2005 [Australia](/wiki/Australian_cricket_team \"Australian\ncricket team\") defeated [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team \"New\nZealand cricket team\") in the first men's full international Twenty20 match,\nplayed at [Eden Park](/wiki/Eden_Park \"Eden Park\") in\n[Auckland](/wiki/Auckland \"Auckland\").
