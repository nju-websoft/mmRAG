It is based on the 1957 [Dr. Seuss](/wiki/Dr._Seuss \"Dr. Seuss\")\nbook _[of the same name](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat \"The Cat in the Hat\")_. The\nfilm stars [Mike Myers](/wiki/Mike_Myers \"Mike Myers\") in the title role of\nthe Cat in the Hat, and [Dakota Fanning](/wiki/Dakota_Fanning \"Dakota\nFanning\") as Sally. Sally's brother (who is unnamed in the book and the [1971\nTV special](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat_\\(TV_special\\) \"The Cat in the Hat \\(TV\nspecial\\)\")), Conrad, is portrayed by [Spencer Breslin](/wiki/Spencer_Breslin\n\"Spencer Breslin\"). The film is the second feature-length Dr. Seuss adaptation\nafter the 2000 holiday film _[How the Grinch Stole\nChristmas](/wiki/Dr._Seuss%27_How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_\\(2000_film\\)\n\"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas \\(2000 film\\)\")_.\n\nThe idea was originally conceived in 2001, with [Tim Allen](/wiki/Tim_Allen\n\"Tim Allen\") initially cast as the Cat, but he dropped his role due to work on\n_[The Santa Clause 2](/wiki/The_Santa_Clause_2 \"The Santa Clause 2\")_ , and\nthe role was later given to Myers. Filming took place in\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\") for three months. While the basic\nplot parallels that of the book, the film filled out its 82 minutes by adding\nnew [subplots](/wiki/Subplot \"Subplot\") and characters significantly different\nfrom the original story, similar to the feature film adaptation of _[How the\nGrinch Stole Christmas](/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_!_\\(film\\) \"How\nthe Grinch Stole Christmas ! \\(film\\)\")_.\n\nReleased on November 21, 2003 in the United States, the film grossed $134\nmillion worldwide.[3] After the film's release, Seuss' widow, [Audrey\nGeisel](/wiki/Audrey_Geisel \"Audrey Geisel\"), decided not to allow any further\nlive-action adaptations of Seuss' works to be produced, and as a result, a\nplanned [sequel](/wiki/Sequel \"Sequel\") based on _[The Cat in the Hat Comes\nBack](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat_Comes_Back \"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back\")_\nwas cancelled.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Cast\n  * 3 Production\n    * 3.1 Development\n    * 3.2 Casting\n    * 3.3 Makeup and visual effects\n    * 3.4 Filming\n  * 4 Music\n    * 4.1 Track listing\n  * 5 Release\n    * 5.1 Home media\n  * 6 Reception\n    * 6.1 Box office\n    * 6.2 Critical response\n    * 6.3 Awards and nominations\n  * 7 Cancelled sequel\n  * 8 Animated reboot\n  * 9 Video game\n    * 9.1 Plot\n    * 9.2 Differences From The Movie\n    * 9.3 Video game reviews\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n##\nPlot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Cat_in_the_Hat_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nConrad and Sally Walden live in the city of Anville with their mother, Joan\nWalden. Joan works for neat-freak Hank Humberfloob, and is hosting an office\nparty at her house. One day, she is called back to the office, leaving the\nkids with Mrs. Kwan, a tired babysitter, and forbidding them to enter the\nliving room, which is being kept pristine for the upcoming party. Joan is also\ndating their next-door neighbor, Larry Quinn, much to Conrad's dismay. Larry\nis constantly on the lookout for any mischief Conrad may be up to, as he wants\nnothing more than to send him away to [military school](/wiki/Military_school\n\"Military school\"), as Conrad has earned the reputation of \"hot-headed\n[trouble-maker](/wiki/Rebellion \"Rebellion\")\", while his sister is\ncharacterized as \"perfect and well-behaved\".\n\nOnce their mother leaves, Sally and Conrad meet a humanoid, oversized talking\ncat in a hat in their house. The cat reveals he wants them to learn to have\nfun, but the children's pet fish doesn't want the cat around when Joan is\naway. The Cat balances some stuff, ruins Joan's best dress, jumps on the\nliving room's couch, and bakes cupcakes that explode. In the process, he\nreleases two trouble-making things, Thing 1 and Thing 2, from a crate that he\nexplains is actually a portal to another world. The Cat tells Conrad that he\nonly has one rule: never open the crate, then allows the Things to have fun,\nbut they make a mess of the house. Despite the Cat's warning, Conrad picks the\nlock on the crate. When the crate's lock attaches itself to the collar of the\nfamily dog, Nevins, Cat and the kids must go find him and the lock. They drive\na super-powered car in search of Nevins and use Cat's magic hat. Conrad\nrealizes that the Things always do the opposite to what they are told. and\nthat this can be used to their advantage and has them stall Joan.\n\nMeanwhile, Larry is revealed to be a fat, unemployed man with false teeth and\nis in financial ruin, though claiming he is a successful businessman in the\nhopes of marrying to Joan and sponging off of her. Larry sees Nevins running\nacross the street and tracks down Joan to tell her, but Things 1 and 2 have\nstalled her on the road, posing as police officers. Larry goes back to the\nhouse, telling Joan to meet him there.\n\nBy the time the kids and the Cat return to the house with the lock, a huge\nmess spills from the unlocked crate and enters the house. They navigate their\nway through the oversized house and find the crate while cleaning up. The\nhouse is returned to its normal proportions but then immediately falls apart.\nThe Cat tells the kids that he planned the whole day, including making not\nopening the crate his one rule, as he knew Conrad could not resist. The kids\nangrily tell the Cat to leave the house. Conrad prepares to face the\nconsequences when Joan comes home, but Sally says she will share the blame.\nThe Cat, having overheard this, happily returns to clean up the mess with a\ngreat cleaning contraption. Afterwards The Cat says goodbye and departs as\nJoan is arriving. Larry arrives when all is restored, thinking he has busted\nthe kids, but when Joan sees the clean house (and a messy Larry), she does not\nbelieve Larry and rejects him. After the successful party, Joan spends time\nwith her children and the Cat finishes narrating. The film ends as he and his\nthings decide to go on a vacation.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Cat_in_the_Hat_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Mike Myers](/wiki/Mike_Myers \"Mike Myers\") as [the Cat in the Hat](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat \"The Cat in the Hat\"), a huge, [anthropomorphic](/wiki/Anthropomorphic \"Anthropomorphic\"), wise-cracking [cat](/wiki/Cat \"Cat\") with a [Brooklyn](/wiki/Brooklyn \"Brooklyn\") accent who wears a special hat which reveals many magical abilities.\n  * [Spencer Breslin](/wiki/Spencer_Breslin \"Spencer Breslin\") as Conrad Walden, Joan's destructive and misbehaved son.\n  * [Dakota Fanning](/wiki/Dakota_Fanning \"Dakota Fanning\") as Sally Walden, Joan's dull, well-behaved, and rule-obeying daughter.\n  * [Kelly Preston](/wiki/Kelly_Preston \"Kelly Preston\") as Joan Walden, Conrad and Sally's mother, and a [workaholic](/wiki/Workaholic \"Workaholic\") [real-estate agent](/wiki/Real-estate_agent \"Real-estate agent\").\n  * [Alec Baldwin](/wiki/Alec_Baldwin \"Alec Baldwin\") as Larry Quinn, the Waldens' pompous, lazy, unemployed next-door neighbor.

[Brian Grazer](/wiki/Brian_Grazer\n\"Brian Grazer\"), who was the producer of _The Grinch_ , stated, \"Because we\ngrew up with these books, and because they have such universal themes and the\nillustrations ignite such fantasy in your mind as a child — the aggregation of\nall those feelings — it leaves an indelible, positive memory. And so when I\nrealized I had a chance to convert first _The Grinch_ and then, _The Cat in\nthe Hat_ , into movies, I was willing to do anything to bring them to the\nscreen.\"[5] Grazer contacted [Bo Welch](/wiki/Bo_Welch \"Bo Welch\") over the\nphone with the offer to direct the film, and he accepted.[6] When production\nbegan, songs written by [Randy Newman](/wiki/Randy_Newman \"Randy Newman\") were\ndropped because they were deemed inferior. Newman's cousin, David Newman,\ncomposed the score for the film. Although Welch and a publicist for Myers\ndenied it, several people said Myers had considerable input into the film's\ndirection, telling some of the cast (co-stars Baldwin and Preston) how to\nperform their scenes.[7]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Cat_in_the_Hat_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\n[Tim Allen](/wiki/Tim_Allen \"Tim Allen\") was originally planned to play the\nrole of the Cat. The script would be originally based on a story conceived by\nAllen, who admitted that as a child he was afraid of Seuss' \"mischievous\nfeline\" babysitter. Allen stated, \"My dream is to give it the edge that scared\nme.\"[8] However, producers did not commission a screenplay until late February\n2001, when [Alec Berg](/wiki/Alec_Berg \"Alec Berg\"), [Jeff\nSchaffer](/wiki/Jeff_Schaffer \"Jeff Schaffer\"), and [Dave\nMandel](/wiki/Dave_Mandel \"Dave Mandel\") (who were also writers on\n_[Seinfeld](/wiki/Seinfeld \"Seinfeld\")_) were hired to write the script\n(replacing the original draft of the film that was written a few years\nbefore),[9] so the film would not be ready to shoot before the deadline. Allen\nwas also committed to shooting [Disney's](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures \"Walt\nDisney Pictures\") _[The Santa Clause 2](/wiki/The_Santa_Clause_2 \"The Santa\nClause 2\")_ , which was also delayed because Allen wanted a script\nrewrite.[10] Due to a scheduling conflict with _The Santa Clause 2_ ,[11] he\ndropped out his role.[12] In March 2002, the role of the Cat was given to\n[Mike Myers](/wiki/Mike_Myers \"Mike Myers\"),[13] even though he had an\nargument with Grazer about starring in a cancelled _[Saturday Night\nLive](/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live \"Saturday Night Live\")_ skit named\n_[Dieter](/wiki/Sprockets_\\(Saturday_Night_Live\\)#Proposed_film_adaptation\n\"Sprockets \\(Saturday Night Live\\)\")_.[14] Myers stated in an interview that\nhe was a long-time fan of the original [Dr. Seuss](/wiki/Dr._Seuss \"Dr.\nSeuss\") book, and that it was the first book he ever read.[15]\n\n### Makeup and visual\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Cat_in_the_Hat_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Makeup and visual effects\")]\n\nMakeup for the character was designed by [Steve\nJohnson](/wiki/Steve_Johnson_\\(special_effects_artist\\) \"Steve Johnson\n\\(special effects artist\\)\"). The Cat costume was made of\n[angora](/wiki/Angora_wool \"Angora wool\") and human hair and was fitted with a\ncooling system. To keep Myers cool during the outdoor shoots, a portable air\nconditioner was available that connected a hose to the suit between shots. The\ntail and ears were battery operated.[16] The Fish was considered somewhat of a\nunique character for Rhythm & Hues (responsible for some of the effects and\nanimation in such films as _[Cats& Dogs](/wiki/Cats_%26_Dogs \"Cats & Dogs\")_,\n_[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the\nKing](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King \"The Lord of the\nRings: The Return of the King\")_ , and _[Scooby-Doo](/wiki/Scooby-Doo_\\(film\\)\n\"Scooby-Doo \\(film\\)\")_), in that the character had no shoulders, hips or\nlegs, so all of the physical performance had to emit from the eyes, head and\nfin motion. Sean Hayes, who provided the voice for the Fish, found the role\nsignificantly different from his usual on-camera jobs; he did not know how the\nfinal animation would look, and all of his work took place alone in a sound\nbooth.[17]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Cat_in_the_Hat_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\nPrior to filming, giant props for the film were stolen from the set. Local\npolice found the props vandalized in a mall car park in [Pomona,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Pomona,_California \"Pomona, California\"). The props were\ncovered with graffiti. No arrests had been made, and filming was to start the\nnext week.[18] [Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal\nphotography\") took place mostly in [California](/wiki/California \"California\")\nfrom October 2002 until January 2003. The neighborhood and the town centre was\nfilmed in a rural valley near [Simi Valley](/wiki/Simi_Valley,_California\n\"Simi Valley, California\"), where 24 houses (each 26-feet square and 52-feet\ntall) were constructed.[19] The downtown area outdoor shots were filmed along\na [Pomona](/wiki/Pomona,_California \"Pomona, California\") street where a\nnumber of antique and gift shops are located. The community decided not to\nredecorate after filming ended, so the surreal paint scheme and some of the\nsignage could still be seen as it appears in the film. Because of so much\n[smog](/wiki/Smog \"Smog\") in the area, the sky had to be digitally replaced\nwith the cartoon-like sky and colours of the background had to be digitally\nfixed.\n\n##\nMusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Cat_in_the_Hat_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\nThe Cat in the Hat  \n---  \n[Film score](/wiki/Film_score \"Film score\") / [Soundtrack\nalbum](/wiki/Soundtrack_album \"Soundtrack album\") by [David\nNewman](/wiki/David_Newman_\\(composer\\) \"David Newman \\(composer\\)\")  \nReleased | November 18, 2003  \nRecorded | 2002  \n[Genre](/wiki/Music_genre \"Music genre\") | [Orchestra](/wiki/Orchestra \"Orchestra\")  \nLength | 48:55  \n[Label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\") | [BMG Soundtracks](/wiki/Bertelsmann_Music_Group \"Bertelsmann Music Group\")  \n  \nThe soundtrack was released on November 18, 2003.[20] It includes [David\nNewman](/wiki/David_Newman_\\(composer\\) \"David Newman \\(composer\\)\")'s score,\nplus a song by [Smash Mouth](/wiki/Smash_Mouth \"Smash Mouth\") (\"[Getting\nBetter](/wiki/Getting_Better \"Getting Better\")\") and (\"[Hang\nOn](/wiki/Get_the_Picture%3F_\\(Smash_Mouth_album\\) \"Get the Picture? \\(Smash\nMouth album\\)\")\") that makes it the third film in a row playing a song in an\nfilm starring [Mike Myers](/wiki/Mike_Myers \"Mike Myers\"), after\n_[Shrek](/wiki/Shrek \"Shrek\")_ (2001) and _[Austin Powers in\nGoldmember](/wiki/Austin_Powers_in_Goldmember \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\")_\n(2002).
