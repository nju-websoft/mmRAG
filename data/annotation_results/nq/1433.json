It consists of [rappers](/wiki/Rapper \"Rapper\") [Bizzy\nBone](/wiki/Bizzy_Bone \"Bizzy Bone\"), [Wish Bone](/wiki/Wish_Bone \"Wish\nBone\"), [Layzie Bone](/wiki/Layzie_Bone \"Layzie Bone\"), [Krayzie\nBone](/wiki/Krayzie_Bone \"Krayzie Bone\"), and [Flesh-n-Bone](/wiki/Flesh-n-\nBone \"Flesh-n-Bone\"). American [West Coast rapper](/wiki/West_Coast_rap \"West\nCoast rap\") [Eazy-E](/wiki/Eazy-E \"Eazy-E\") signed Bone Thugs-N-Harmony to\n[Ruthless Records](/wiki/Ruthless_Records \"Ruthless Records\") in late 1993,\nwhen Bone Thugs debuted with their [EP](/wiki/Extended_play \"Extended play\")\n_[Creepin on ah Come Up](/wiki/Creepin_on_ah_Come_Up \"Creepin on ah Come\nUp\")_. The EP included their breakout hit single \"[Thuggish Ruggish\nBone](/wiki/Thuggish_Ruggish_Bone \"Thuggish Ruggish Bone\")\".\n\nIn 1995, the group released its second album, _[E. 1999\nEternal](/wiki/E._1999_Eternal \"E. 1999 Eternal\")_ , which included hits \"[1st\nof tha Month](/wiki/1st_of_tha_Month \"1st of tha Month\")\" and \"[East\n1999](/wiki/East_1999 \"East 1999\")\". A tribute to then-recently deceased\nEazy-E, titled \"[Tha Crossroads](/wiki/Tha_Crossroads \"Tha Crossroads\")\", won\na [Grammy award](/wiki/Grammy_award \"Grammy award\") in 1997. _[The Art of\nWar](/wiki/The_Art_of_War_\\(Bone_Thugs-n-Harmony_album\\) \"The Art of War\n\\(Bone Thugs-n-Harmony album\\)\")_ , the group's third album, was also released\nin 1997. Bone Thugs is the only group that has worked with [2Pac](/wiki/2Pac\n\"2Pac\"), [Notorious B.I.G.](/wiki/Notorious_B.I.G. \"Notorious B.I.G.\"),\n[Eazy-E](/wiki/Eazy-E \"Eazy-E\"), and [Big Pun](/wiki/Big_Pun \"Big Pun\") while\nthey were still alive. The editors of [About.com](/wiki/About.com \"About.com\")\nranked them #12 on their list of the \"25 Best Rap Groups of All Time\",[3] and\n[MTV](/wiki/MTV \"MTV\") called them \"the most melodic hip-hop group of all\ntime\".[4]\n\nIn 2000, _[BTNHResurrection](/wiki/BTNHResurrection \"BTNHResurrection\")_\nreached [platinum](/wiki/Platinum_disc \"Platinum disc\") in one month, while\n2002's _[Thug World Order](/wiki/Thug_World_Order \"Thug World Order\")_\nreceived more moderate sales and promotion, going [gold](/wiki/Gold_disc \"Gold\ndisc\") and peaking at #3 on the [Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums](/wiki/Top_R%26B/Hip-\nHop_Albums \"Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums\") chart. After that album, the group went\non hiatus from their label and released their sixth studio album, _[Thug\nStories](/wiki/Thug_Stories \"Thug Stories\")_ , independently in 2006. In 2007\nthey had another major-label release, _[Strength&\nLoyalty](/wiki/Strength_%26_Loyalty \"Strength & Loyalty\")_, on [Swizz\nBeatz](/wiki/Swizz_Beatz \"Swizz Beatz\")'s label [Full Surface\nRecords](/wiki/Full_Surface_Records \"Full Surface Records\"). Bone Thugs-N-\nHarmony \"officially\" returned with their 2010 album _[Uni5: The World's\nEnemy](/wiki/Uni5:_The_World%27s_Enemy \"Uni5: The World's Enemy\")_, released\nby their own record label, [BTNH Worldwide](/wiki/BTNH_Worldwide \"BTNH\nWorldwide\"), with distribution by [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records\n\"Warner Bros. Records\")\n\nDue to conflicts within the group, longtime members Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone\nofficially left the group in April 2011 to work with their independent label,\nThe Life Entertainment.[5][6][7] They would later return, officially re-\nunifying the group. In August 2013, however, Layzie Bone announced that _he_\nwould be stepping aside to work more on his solo career.[8][9] In the same\nmonth, BTNH signed with eOne Entertainment (formerly known as [Koch\nRecords](/wiki/Koch_Records \"Koch Records\")), who they had previously\npartnered with to release 2006's _Thug Stories_.[10] Layzie Bone has since re-\nunited with the group. On April 28th the entire group performed a show in\nBiloxi, MS along with Juvenile & Nelly. On June 1st of 2018, Bone Thugs will\nbe reuniting for a show just outside Boston, Massachusetts, at the Wonderland\nBallroom in Revere, MA.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 1991–93: B.O.N.E.

Enterprise early\nyears[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bone_Thugs-n-Harmony&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: 1991–93: B.O.N.E. Enterprise early years\")]\n\nFormed in [Cleveland, Ohio](/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio \"Cleveland, Ohio\") in\n1991,[1][2] the group was originally called \"The Band-Aid Boys\". They then\nformed B.O.N.E. Enterpri$e, which consisted of four members — [Krayzie\nBone](/wiki/Krayzie_Bone \"Krayzie Bone\"), [Layzie Bone](/wiki/Layzie_Bone\n\"Layzie Bone\"), [Bizzy Bone](/wiki/Bizzy_Bone \"Bizzy Bone\"), and [Wish\nBone](/wiki/Wish_Bone \"Wish Bone\") (all except for [Flesh-n-Bone](/wiki/Flesh-\nn-Bone \"Flesh-n-Bone\")) — and recorded an album entitled _[Faces of\nDeath](/wiki/Faces_of_Death_\\(album\\) \"Faces of Death \\(album\\)\")_ in the\nstudio of their then-mentor, Kermit Henderson (Krayzie Bone's older brother)\non his indie label Stoney Burke in 1993. Like so many aspiring rappers around\nthe country, they put in calls to executives at record companies, hoping to\nfind someone who would listen. In hopes of securing a record deal, the group\nwas given an audition over the phone, receiving an unfulfilled promise from\nrapper [Eazy-E](/wiki/Eazy-E \"Eazy-E\") to call them back. Determined to reach\nhim, they scrounged together the money for [one-way bus\ntickets](/wiki/Intercity_bus_service \"Intercity bus service\") to [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\"). They left for a three-day\n[Greyhound](/wiki/Greyhound_bus \"Greyhound bus\") trek and spent four months on\nthe city streets, putting in frequent calls to find him. Nothing came of their\nsearch except the news that Eazy-E was, in fact, on his way to Cleveland for a\nshow.\n\nThe quartet returned to Ohio, where Diego Blak (born Diego Hodge), a marketer\nand promoter who had been co-executive producer of _Faces Of Death_ ,\nintroduced them to Eazy-E at a concert he promoted in Cleveland. There, on\nNovember 2, 1993, they auditioned for Eazy in his dressing room; Krayzie\nperformed his verse of \"Flow Motion\" from the _Faces of Death_ album, and Eazy\nwas impressed.[11] B.O.N.E Enterpri$e then traveled back to Los Angeles after\nthe Cleveland show to seal the deal. At this point, Eazy renamed them Thugs-N-\nHarmony, but as they wanted to keep the bone name, they made their name Bone\nThugs-N-Harmony. Eazy [signed](/wiki/Recording_contract \"Recording contract\")\nthe group (minus Flesh-n-Bone) to his label [Ruthless\nRecords](/wiki/Ruthless_Records \"Ruthless Records\").[1]\n\n### 1994: _Creepin on ah Come Up_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bone_Thugs-n-\nHarmony&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: 1994: Creepin on ah Come Up\")]\n\nReleased in June 1994, the [EP](/wiki/Extended_play \"Extended play\") _[Creepin\non ah Come Up](/wiki/Creepin_on_ah_Come_Up \"Creepin on ah Come Up\")_ was Bone\nThugs-N-Harmony's debut with Ruthless. The album's subject matter was focused\nalmost entirely on [violent criminal activity](/wiki/Gangsta_rap \"Gangsta\nrap\"). Peaking at #12 on the [_Billboard_ Top 200 Albums](/wiki/Billboard_200\n\"Billboard 200\") chart and #2 on the [Top R&B/Hip-Hop\nAlbums](/wiki/Top_R%26B/Hip-Hop_Albums \"Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums\") chart,[12] it\nincluded the hit singles \"[Thuggish Ruggish Bone](/wiki/Thuggish_Ruggish_Bone\n\"Thuggish Ruggish Bone\")\" and \"[Foe tha Love of $](/wiki/Foe_tha_Love_of_$\n\"Foe tha Love of $\")\", the second of which featured a verse by Eazy-E.\n\"Thuggish Ruggish Bone\" peaked at #22 on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") chart and #2 on the [Hot Rap\nTracks](/wiki/Hot_Rap_Tracks \"Hot Rap Tracks\") chart, and \"Foe tha Love of $\"\npeaked at #41 on the Hot 100 and #4 on Rap Tracks.[13] After a slow start that\nsaw the album's success limited to [gangsta rap](/wiki/Gangsta_rap \"Gangsta\nrap\") audiences, it broke through to the mainstream. The EP marked a major\nchange in style for the group, as they now fully embraced the\n[G-funk](/wiki/G-funk \"G-funk\") common in [West Coast hip\nhop](/wiki/West_Coast_hip_hop \"West Coast hip hop\") of the time. Beats were\nsupplied by [DJ Yella](/wiki/DJ_Yella \"DJ Yella\"), Rhythum D, and Kenny\nMcCloud, and it was the group's first collaboration with newcomer producer [DJ\nU-Neek](/wiki/DJ_U-Neek \"DJ U-Neek\"), who would craft the group's signature\nsound by producing the majority of their next two albums. For over a year,\nEazy-E nurtured their career, continuing to serve as their executive producer\nand teaching them the business skills he had taught himself over the years.\nThe growing relationship was cut short, however, when Eazy-E died on March 26,\n1995, from complications from [AIDS](/wiki/AIDS \"AIDS\"). Briefly, the young\nrappers thought they had lost everything with the loss of their friend and\nmentor. However, the group's potential was already apparent, and Ruthless\nRecords continued to support them.\n\n### 1995–96: _E. 1999 Eternal_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bone_Thugs-n-\nHarmony&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: 1995–96: E. 1999 Eternal\")]\n\nIn 1995, the group's second album, _[E. 1999 Eternal](/wiki/E._1999_Eternal\n\"E. 1999 Eternal\")_ , was released. It included the singles \"[1st of tha\nMonth](/wiki/1st_of_tha_Month \"1st of tha Month\")\", which peaked at #14 on the\nHot 100 and #4 on Hot Rap Tracks, and \"[Tha Crossroads](/wiki/Tha_Crossroads\n\"Tha Crossroads\")\", which reached #1 on both the Hot 100 and Hot Rap Tracks\ncharts. The album generally saw positive reviews from critics as Bone had\ndiversified its content and musical style. Critics were particularly intrigued\nby the album due to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's ability to reduce the banality\nassociated with gangsta rap in their music at a time when the subgenre had\nbecome exceedingly cliché.[14] A considerable portion of the album's concept\nwas built upon violent subject matter, yet they also incorporated deeper\nthemes, as its songs dealt with more [spirituality](/wiki/Spirituality\n\"Spirituality\") and [occult](/wiki/Occult \"Occult\")\n[mysticism](/wiki/Mysticism \"Mysticism\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nalbum was produced by [DJ U-Neek](/wiki/DJ_U-Neek \"DJ U-Neek\") (with co-\nproduction from Tony C. and Kenny McCloud). _E. 1999 Eternal_ also introduced\nBone's trademark tracks devoted entirely to the use of\n[marijuana](/wiki/Marijuana \"Marijuana\"). The album name originated from one\nof the street names of a corner (E. 99th street & St. Clair) that was a\nfamiliar hangout to Bone members, as well as Eazy-E's album, _[Eternal\nE](/wiki/Eternal_E \"Eternal E\")_. Naming it after Eazy-E's album was just\nanother way of showing respect and tribute to the rapper who had helped them\nreach success. Also in 1995, Flesh-n-Bone would become the first member of the\ngroup to release a debut album, entitled T.H.U.G.S, which was certified\n[gold](/wiki/Gold_disc \"Gold disc\") by the [RIAA](/wiki/RIAA \"RIAA\"). In 1996,\ndue to their success, the Cleveland clan established their own label, [Mo\nThugs Records](/wiki/Mo_Thugs_Records \"Mo Thugs Records\"), and released the\n_[Family Scriptures](/wiki/Family_Scriptures \"Family Scriptures\")_ compilation\nalbum to introduce many of the Cleveland-based and other artists whom they\nwere developing. _E. 1999 Eternal_ is the group's most commercially successful\nalbum; it has since been certified 5x [platinum](/wiki/Platinum_disc \"Platinum\ndisc\") by the RIAA.\n\nThere were plans for Bone Thugs-N-Harmony to collaborate with [West Coast\nrapper](/wiki/West_Coast_rap \"West Coast rap\") [2Pac](/wiki/2Pac \"2Pac\") on a\nstudio album called _One Nation_. The project would bring together other hip\nhop artists from all areas of the American map such as [Boot Camp\nClik](/wiki/Boot_Camp_Clik \"Boot Camp Clik\"),[15] [OutKast](/wiki/OutKast\n\"OutKast\"), [Scarface](/wiki/Scarface_\\(rapper\\) \"Scarface \\(rapper\\)\"),\n[E-40](/wiki/E-40 \"E-40\"), and more.[16] As 2Pac was unfortunately shot the\nalbum never came into fruition.However, bootlegs of songs produced while Pac\nwas still alive have been distributed.\n\n### 1997–2001: _The Art of War_ and\n_BTNHResurrection_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bone_Thugs-n-\nHarmony&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: 1997–2001: The Art of War and\nBTNHResurrection\")]\n\nIn 1997, the group released the [double-disc](/wiki/Double_album \"Double\nalbum\") set _[The Art of War](/wiki/The_Art_of_War_\\(Bone_Thugs-n-\nHarmony_album\\) \"The Art of War \\(Bone Thugs-n-Harmony album\\)\")_. The album\nsaw Bone further explore a wide variety of subjects and styles, with even more\nfocus on God and family and an overall more ambient, mellow sound. The group\nstill incorporated violent lyrics, however, with a large portion of the album\ndedicated to what they labeled \"clones\" who claimed Bone had stolen their\nquick-tongued rapping style and vice versa. The album had been rumored to be\ntitled \"DNA Level C\" which is Cleveland backwards.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nsingle \"[Look into My Eyes](/wiki/Look_into_My_Eyes_\\(Bone_Thugs-n-\nHarmony_song\\) \"Look into My Eyes \\(Bone Thugs-n-Harmony song\\)\")\" appeared on\nthe soundtrack of the film _[Batman& Robin](/wiki/Batman_%26_Robin_\\(film\\)\n\"Batman & Robin \\(film\\)\")_. It peaked at #4 on the Hot 100 and #2 on the Hot\nRap Tracks chart.[13] \"[If I Could Teach The\nWorld](/wiki/If_I_Could_Teach_The_World \"If I Could Teach The World\")\", the\nother single from _The Art of War_ , peaked at #27 on the Hot 100 and #3 on\nthe Hot Rap Tracks,[13] and won an [American Music\nAward](/wiki/American_Music_Award \"American Music Award\"). The album also\nincluded \"Thug Luv\" with [Tupac Shakur](/wiki/Tupac_Shakur \"Tupac Shakur\").\nThe group's promotional efforts were dampened by the absence of [Bizzy\nBone](/wiki/Bizzy_Bone \"Bizzy Bone\") from the album's videos and from large\nportions of the ensuing tour and other public appearances. This absence\neventually fueled rumors of a break-up.\n\nIn 2000, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony released\n_[BTNHResurrection](/wiki/BTNHResurrection \"BTNHResurrection\")_ , featuring\nthe single \"[Resurrection (Paper, Paper)](/wiki/Resurrection_\\(Paper,_Paper\\)\n\"Resurrection \\(Paper, Paper\\)\")\", which peaked on the [Hot R&B/Hip-Hop\nSongs](/wiki/Hot_R%26B/Hip-Hop_Songs \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs\") chart at\n#52.[13] The album's first half featured a slew of hardcore and dark tracks,\nwith the second half being considerably more introspective and soft. Other\nsingles from the album, including \"Can't Give it Up\", failed to crack the\nBillboard Hot 100, and the big-budget video for \"Change the World\" failed to\nreceive any rotation. This was their first group album to prominently feature\n[Flesh-n-Bone](/wiki/Flesh-n-Bone \"Flesh-n-Bone\"), whose presence had been\nlimited on previous releases because he had never signed with the group's\nlabel, Ruthless Records. Flesh was convicted for assault with a\n[firearm](/wiki/Firearm \"Firearm\") and criminal possession of a weapon in June\n2000.[17] Pleading guilty, Flesh was sentenced to 11 years in prison.[18]\n\nThe group again began having public disputes with Bizzy Bone. Bizzy Bone\nabstained from promoting _BTNHResurrection_ because he felt that Ruthless\nRecords owed him money.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] He dropped a million-dollar lawsuit he had\nfiled against [Sony Music](/wiki/Sony_Music \"Sony Music\") and [Loud\nRecords](/wiki/Loud_Records \"Loud Records\") in exchange for a termination of\nhis Sony contract.[19] Three members of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony released solo\nalbums in 2001: Bizzy Bone with _[The\nGift](/wiki/The_Gift_\\(Bizzy_Bone_album\\) \"The Gift \\(Bizzy Bone album\\)\")_ ,\nLayzie Bone (under the name L-Burna) with _[Thug by\nNature](/wiki/Thug_by_Nature \"Thug by Nature\")_ , and Krayzie Bone with _[Thug\non da Line](/wiki/Thug_on_da_Line \"Thug on da Line\")_.[20]\n\n### 2002–06: _Thug World Order_ and _Thug\nStories_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bone_Thugs-n-Harmony&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: 2002–06: Thug World Order and Thug Stories\")]\n\nIn 2002, the group released _[Thug World Order](/wiki/Thug_World_Order \"Thug\nWorld Order\")_. This album, made up of what were described[_[by\nwhom?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] as overly-violent and political\nsongs, saw a drastic change in subject matter and tone for the group. The\nlyrics were almost completely void of any violence, while a larger number of\ntracks focused on the group itself. In contrast, several songs originally\nintended to be included on the album that were leaked after its release\nportrayed a much different album.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nalbum debuted at #12 on the _Billboard_ 200.[12] The first single released\nfrom the album was \"Get Up & Get It\", featuring [3LW](/wiki/3LW \"3LW\"). The\nsecond single, \"Home\", which featured [Phil Collins](/wiki/Phil_Collins \"Phil\nCollins\") performing part of his song \"[Take Me\nHome](/wiki/Take_Me_Home_\\(Phil_Collins_song\\) \"Take Me Home \\(Phil Collins\nsong\\)\")\", peaked at #33 on the [Rhythmic Top 40](/wiki/Rhythmic_Top_40\n\"Rhythmic Top 40\"), impacting the charts in a number of countries, most\nnotably the United Kingdom.[13] Bizzy Bone was expelled from the group in\nJanuary 2003, leaving only 3 active members: Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, and\nWish Bone.[21] _Thug World Order_ was also Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's final album\nwith Ruthless Records; after their original contract with Ruthless had\nexpired, they decided they wanted to do their own thing.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n_[Thug Stories](/wiki/Thug_Stories \"Thug Stories\")_ , Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's\nseventh album, was recorded on [Koch Records](/wiki/Koch_Records \"Koch\nRecords\") and released on September 19, 2006. It marked the first time Bone\nThugs had recorded as a trio since they released an internet-only\n[EP](/wiki/Extended_play \"Extended play\") album called _Bone 4 Life_[22] in\nSeptember 2005. _Thug Stories_ featured a slightly more mature style, and the\ngroup leaned more heavily towards its [harmonic](/wiki/Harmony \"Harmony\")\nroots than its \"[thug](/wiki/Gangsta_rap \"Gangsta rap\")\" origins. The album\nsold 38,000 in its first week and peaked at #25 on the [_Billboard_\n200](/wiki/Billboard_200 \"Billboard 200\")[12] and #1 on the [Independent\nAlbums](/wiki/Independent_Albums \"Independent Albums\") chart.\n\n### 2007: _Strength & Loyalty_ and\n_T.H.U.G.S._[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bone_Thugs-n-\nHarmony&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: 2007: Strength & Loyalty and\nT.H.U.G.S.\")]\n\nOriginally to be called _The Bone Thugs Story_ , _[Strength&\nLoyalty](/wiki/Strength_%26_Loyalty \"Strength & Loyalty\")_ was released on May\n8, 2007 on [Interscope Records](/wiki/Interscope_Records \"Interscope Records\")\nimprint [Full Surface Records](/wiki/Full_Surface_Records \"Full Surface\nRecords\").

The executive producer\nof the album was [Swizz Beatz](/wiki/Swizz_Beatz \"Swizz Beatz\"). The first\nsingle was \"[I Tried](/wiki/I_Tried_\\(Bone_Thugs-N-Harmony_song\\) \"I Tried\n\\(Bone Thugs-N-Harmony song\\)\")\", which was their first top-10 hit in 10\nyears, peaking at number 6 on the U.S. [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\"). The second single was \"[Lil\nLove](/wiki/Lil_L.O.V.E. \"Lil L.O.V.E.\")\", which failed to reach the success\nof its predecessor. The album has been certified [gold](/wiki/Gold_disc \"Gold\ndisc\") by the RIAA.[23]\n\n2007 also saw the release of the\nsemi-[autobiographical](/wiki/Autobiographical \"Autobiographical\") film _I\nTried_ , directed by [Rich Newey](/wiki/Rich_Newey \"Rich Newey\"), which\nexplored what might have happened to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony had they not gotten\ntheir break with Eazy-E. Layzie, Krayzie, and Wish Bone starred in the film,\nplaying themselves.[24] Also in 2007, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony won the [American\nMusic Award](/wiki/American_Music_Award \"American Music Award\") for Favorite\nRap/Hip-Hop Band, Duo or Group.\n\n_[T.H.U.G.S.](/wiki/T.H.U.G.S._\\(Bone_Thugs-n-Harmony_album\\) \"T.H.U.G.S.\n\\(Bone Thugs-n-Harmony album\\)\")_ , an album featuring previously-unreleased,\nlargely [remixed](/wiki/Remix \"Remix\") Bone Thugs-N-Harmony songs that hadn't\nmade the final cut of the _[BTNHResurrection](/wiki/BTNHResurrection\n\"BTNHResurrection\")_ and _[Thug World Order](/wiki/Thug_World_Order \"Thug\nWorld Order\")_ albums, was released on November 13, 2007 by their former\nrecord label, [Ruthless Records](/wiki/Ruthless_Records \"Ruthless Records\").\nAlthough the album embodies old tracks, there are some notable changes: new\nbeats, [distorted](/wiki/Audio_distortion \"Audio distortion\") production,\nvoice manipulation, and new song titles. The sole single off the album was\n\"Young Thugs\", which was accompanied by a newly filmed music video featuring\nKrayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, and Wish.\n\nIn November 2007, Layzie Bone confirmed that he had completed the _[Bone\nBrothers III](/wiki/Bone_Brothers_III \"Bone Brothers III\")_ album with Bizzy\nBone, spurring speculation about a full Bone reunion. In a video interview,\nKrayzie Bone stated that they all wanted to reunite but that record label\nissues might prevent an official reunion.[25] [Bizzy Bone](/wiki/Bizzy_Bone\n\"Bizzy Bone\") had attended a Bone Thugs performance during that time, and he\nand the three then-active members had a \"good conversation\".[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAfter nearly a decade of incarceration, [Flesh-n-Bone](/wiki/Flesh-n-Bone\n\"Flesh-n-Bone\") was released from prison on July 13, 2008. In an interview,\nBizzy confirmed his return, the group having reunited in time for Flesh's\nrelease.[26]\n\n### 2010–13: _Uni5: The World 's Enemy_ and _The Art of War: World War\nIII_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bone_Thugs-n-Harmony&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: 2010–13: Uni5: The World's Enemy and The Art of War: World War\nIII\")]\n\nBone Thugs-N-Harmony's five members officially returned with their new album\n_[Uni5: The World's Enemy](/wiki/Uni5:_The_World%27s_Enemy \"Uni5: The World's\nEnemy\")_, released on May 4, 2010 by their own record label, [BTNH\nWorldwide](/wiki/BTNH_Worldwide \"BTNH Worldwide\"), with distribution by\n[Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Music_Group \"Warner Music Group\") _Uni5_ also\nmarks the return of long-time Bone collaborator [DJ U-Neek](/wiki/DJ_U-Neek\n\"DJ U-Neek\"), who was absent from 2007's _Strength & Loyalty_ but had produced\nfor the group throughout their career, including on hits \"Thuggish Ruggish\nBone\" and \"Tha Crossroads\". This studio effort leans toward radio-friendly\nnumbers and proper grown-man tracks, with the core four members offering life\nlessons as Bizzy gives his Biblical perspective.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] They\nreleased the singles \"See Me Shine\", featuring Jay Rush and [Lyfe\nJennings](/wiki/Lyfe_Jennings \"Lyfe Jennings\"), and \"Rebirth\", featuring\nThin-C, a member of the [Mo Thugs](/wiki/Mo_Thugs \"Mo Thugs\").[27] A third\nsingle, \"[Meet Me in the Sky](/wiki/Meet_Me_in_the_Sky \"Meet Me in the Sky\")\",\nwas released on March 22.\n\nBone Thugs-N-Harmony announced on their blog over the summer of 2011 that they\nwere planning a new album for 2012.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] They\nreiterated those plans in a November interview.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThroughout 2011, [Krayzie Bone](/wiki/Krayzie_Bone \"Krayzie Bone\"), [Bizzy\nBone](/wiki/Bizzy_Bone \"Bizzy Bone\"), and [Layzie Bone](/wiki/Layzie_Bone\n\"Layzie Bone\") spoke about many new projects coming in 2012. Those projects\nwere to include an anniversary album featuring all 5 members; a Bizzy &\nKrayzie duet album; and compilation albums of unreleased Bone Thugs-N-Harmony\nmaterial from the mid to late 90's and 2000's, prospectively titled _Lost\nArchives Vol. 1_. The group put their differences aside to reunite and\nbelatedly mark their 20th anniversary at the [Rock the\nBells](/wiki/Rock_the_Bells \"Rock the Bells\") festival series of summer\n2012.[28]\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, West Coast rapper [Game](/wiki/Game_\\(rapper\\)\n\"Game \\(rapper\\)\") sampled Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's \"1st Of Tha Month\" on his\nnew [posse cut](/wiki/Posse_cut \"Posse cut\")\n\"[Celebration](/wiki/Celebration_\\(Game_song\\) \"Celebration \\(Game song\\)\")\",\nwith the legendary group's blessing.

In early November 2013, [Krayzie\nBone](/wiki/Krayzie_Bone \"Krayzie Bone\") told [HipHopDX](/wiki/HipHopDX\n\"HipHopDX\") that the _Art of War III_ album would feature only Layzie, Bizzy,\nand Flesh-N-Bone, and that neither he nor Wish Bone had recorded any material\nfor that album. However, Krayzie and Wish both ended up appearing on the album\nin the form of previously unreleased tracks that had been cut from _Uni5: The\nWorld 's Enemy_.[31] _[The Art of War: World War\nIII](/wiki/The_Art_of_War:_World_War_III \"The Art of War: World War III\")_ was\nreleased on December 10, 2013.\n\n### 2014–present: New album, _New Waves_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bone_Thugs-\nn-Harmony&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: 2014–present: New album, New\nWaves\")]\n\nOn July 15, 2014, it was announced that Bone Thugs-N-Harmony would release\ntheir final album in 2015.

Krayzie estimated that Bone Thugs-N-\nHarmony had probably recorded 75 to 100 songs since they began work on the\nalbum, which was planned as a [double-disc project](/wiki/Double_album \"Double\nalbum\"). The first disc was to contain Bone Thugs-N-Harmony content\nexclusively, with no features, and would have 18–20 songs. The second disc was\nplanned to feature a large number of big-name guest appearances such as\n[Mariah Carey](/wiki/Mariah_Carey \"Mariah Carey\"), [Kendrick\nLamar](/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar \"Kendrick Lamar\"), [Phil\nCollins](/wiki/Phil_Collins \"Phil Collins\"), [Wiz Khalifa](/wiki/Wiz_Khalifa\n\"Wiz Khalifa\"), [Drake](/wiki/Drake_\\(rapper\\) \"Drake \\(rapper\\)\"), [A$AP\nMob](/wiki/A$AP_Mob \"A$AP Mob\"), and [Linkin Park](/wiki/Linkin_Park \"Linkin\nPark\"), along with beats from [Dr. Dre](/wiki/Dr._Dre \"Dr. Dre\") & [DJ\nU-Neek](/wiki/DJ_U-Neek \"DJ U-Neek\"), who had each been tapped for the album.\n[Damizza](/wiki/Damizza \"Damizza\") would be producing/overseeing the entire\n_E. 1999 Legends_ album project, which was projected to be distributed through\nDamizza's Baby Ree Records label.[33]\n\nOn February 14, 2015 — Valentine's Day — producer and long-time Bone\ncollaborator Damizza officially presented the single \"More Than Thugs\", slated\nto appear on the _Damizza Presents_ album.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\ngroup's vocal delivery on the song would be considered by\nmany[_[who?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] as vintage Bone Thugs-N-Harmony\nvocal sound.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] As of late April 2015, the video for \"More Than\nThugs\" was in the editing stage and featured all 5 members. Flesh Bone and\nWish Bone were in the studio with Damizza in 2015 to complete the eight Bone\nsongs that were close to finished for the _E. 1999 Legends_ album. Under\ndirection from [A&R](/wiki/A%26R \"A&R\") team and long-time manager Steve Lobel\nand agent Jamie Adler, they are also working on the remix of [Machine Gun\nKelly](/wiki/Machine_Gun_Kelly_\\(rapper\\) \"Machine Gun Kelly \\(rapper\\)\")'s\n[Cleveland](/wiki/Cleveland \"Cleveland\") anthem single \"Till I\nDie\".[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] In August 2015, Krayzie announced that the first bid of at least $1\nmillion had been received for _E. 1999 Legends_.[34]\n\nIn 2017, Krayzie Bone and Bizzy Bone announced that they would be releasing\ntheir long-awaited duet album together entitled _New Waves_ under the name\nBone Thugs.
