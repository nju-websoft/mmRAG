The capital and\nlargest city is [Harare](/wiki/Harare \"Harare\"). A country of roughly 16\nmillion[5] people, Zimbabwe has 16 [official\nlanguages](/wiki/Official_languages \"Official languages\"),[14] with\n[English](/wiki/English_language \"English language\"),\n[Shona](/wiki/Shona_language \"Shona language\"), and\n[Ndebele](/wiki/Northern_Ndebele_language \"Northern Ndebele language\") the\nmost commonly used.\n\nSince the 11th century, present-day Zimbabwe has been the site of several\norganised states and kingdoms as well as a major route for migration and\ntrade. The [British South Africa Company](/wiki/British_South_Africa_Company\n\"British South Africa Company\") of [Cecil Rhodes](/wiki/Cecil_Rhodes \"Cecil\nRhodes\") first [demarcated](/wiki/Rhodesia_\\(region\\) \"Rhodesia \\(region\\)\")\nthe present territory during the 1890s; it became the [self-\ngoverning](/wiki/Self-governing_colony \"Self-governing colony\") British colony\nof [Southern Rhodesia](/wiki/Southern_Rhodesia \"Southern Rhodesia\") in 1923.\nIn 1965, the conservative [white](/wiki/White_people_in_Zimbabwe \"White people\nin Zimbabwe\") [minority government](/wiki/Minority_rule \"Minority rule\")\n[unilaterally declared\nindependence](/wiki/Rhodesia%27s_Unilateral_Declaration_of_Independence\n\"Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence\") as\n[Rhodesia](/wiki/Rhodesia \"Rhodesia\"). The state endured international\nisolation and a 15-year [guerrilla war](/wiki/Rhodesian_Bush_War \"Rhodesian\nBush War\") with [black nationalist](/wiki/Black_nationalist \"Black\nnationalist\") forces; this culminated in a [peace\nagreement](/wiki/Lancaster_House_Agreement \"Lancaster House Agreement\") that\nestablished universal enfranchisement and _[de jure](/wiki/De_jure \"De jure\")_\nsovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980. Zimbabwe then joined the [Commonwealth\nof Nations](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations \"Commonwealth of Nations\"), which it\nwithdrew from in December 2003. It is a member of the [United\nNations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\"), the [Southern African\nDevelopment Community](/wiki/Southern_African_Development_Community \"Southern\nAfrican Development Community\") (SADC), the [African\nUnion](/wiki/African_Union \"African Union\") (AU), and the [Common Market for\nEastern and Southern\nAfrica](/wiki/Common_Market_for_Eastern_and_Southern_Africa \"Common Market for\nEastern and Southern Africa\") (COMESA). It was once known as the \"Jewel of\nAfrica\" for its prosperity.[15][16][17]\n\n[Robert Mugabe](/wiki/Robert_Mugabe \"Robert Mugabe\") became [Prime Minister of\nZimbabwe](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Zimbabwe \"Prime Minister of Zimbabwe\") in\n1980, when his [ZANU-PF](/wiki/ZANU-PF \"ZANU-PF\") party won the\n[elections](/wiki/Southern_Rhodesian_general_election,_1980 \"Southern\nRhodesian general election, 1980\") following the end of white minority rule;\nhe was the [President of Zimbabwe](/wiki/President_of_Zimbabwe \"President of\nZimbabwe\") from 1987 until his resignation in 2017. Under Mugabe's\n[authoritarian](/wiki/Authoritarianism \"Authoritarianism\") regime, the state\nsecurity apparatus dominated the country and was responsible for widespread\n[human rights](/wiki/Human_rights \"Human rights\") violations.[18] Mugabe\nmaintained the revolutionary socialist rhetoric of the [Cold\nWar](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\") era, blaming Zimbabwe's economic woes on\nconspiring Western capitalist countries.[19] Contemporary African political\nleaders were reluctant to criticise Mugabe, who was burnished by his anti-\nimperialist credentials, though Archbishop [Desmond Tutu](/wiki/Desmond_Tutu\n\"Desmond Tutu\") called him \"a cartoon figure of an archetypal African\ndictator\".[20] The country has been in economic decline since the 1990s,\nexperiencing several crashes and [hyperinflation](/wiki/Hyperinflation\n\"Hyperinflation\") along the way.[21]\n\nOn 15 November 2017, in the wake of over a year of\n[protests](/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Zimbabwe_protests \"2016–17 Zimbabwe\nprotests\") against his government as well as Zimbabwe's rapidly declining\neconomy, [Mugabe was placed under house\narrest](/wiki/2017_Zimbabwean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat \"2017 Zimbabwean coup\nd'état\") by [the country's national army](/wiki/Zimbabwe_National_Army\n\"Zimbabwe National Army\") in a [coup d'état](/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat \"Coup\nd'état\").[22][23] On 19 November 2017, ZANU-PF sacked Robert Mugabe as party\nleader and appointed former Vice President [Emmerson\nMnangagwa](/wiki/Emmerson_Mnangagwa \"Emmerson Mnangagwa\") in his place.[24] On\n21 November 2017, Mugabe tendered his resignation prior to impeachment\nproceedings being completed.[25]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Etymology\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 Pre-colonial era (1000–1887)\n    * 2.2 Colonial era and Rhodesia (1888–1964)\n    * 2.3 UDI and civil war (1965–1980)\n    * 2.4 Independence era (1980–present)\n  * 3 Geography and environment\n    * 3.1 Climate\n    * 3.2 Flora and fauna\n    * 3.3 Environmental issues\n  * 4 Government and politics\n    * 4.1 Human rights\n    * 4.2 Armed forces\n    * 4.3 Administrative divisions\n  * 5 Economy\n    * 5.1 Agriculture\n    * 5.2 Tourism\n    * 5.3 Water supply and sanitation\n  * 6 Science and technology\n  * 7 Demographics\n    * 7.1 Largest cities\n    * 7.2 Language\n    * 7.3 Refugee crisis\n    * 7.4 Religion\n  * 8 Culture\n    * 8.1 Arts\n    * 8.2 Cuisine\n    * 8.3 Sports\n    * 8.4 Media\n    * 8.5 Scouting\n    * 8.6 National symbols\n  * 9 Health\n  * 10 Education\n  * 11 See also\n  * 12 Source\n  * 13 Notes\n  * 14 References\n  * 15 Sources\n  * 16 Further reading\n  * 17 External links\n\n## Etymology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Zimbabwe&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Etymology\")]\n\nFurther information: [Great Zimbabwe](/wiki/Great_Zimbabwe \"Great Zimbabwe\")\nand [Rhodesia (name)](/wiki/Rhodesia_\\(name\\) \"Rhodesia \\(name\\)\")\n\nThe name \"Zimbabwe\" stems from a [Shona](/wiki/Shona_language \"Shona\nlanguage\") term for [Great Zimbabwe](/wiki/Great_Zimbabwe \"Great Zimbabwe\"),\nan ancient ruined city in the country's south-east whose remains are now a\nprotected site. Two different theories address the origin of the word. Many\nsources hold that \"Zimbabwe\" derives from _dzimba-dza-mabwe_ , translated from\nthe Karanga dialect of Shona as \"large houses of stone\" (_dzimba_ = plural of\n_imba_ , \"house\"; _mabwe_ = plural of _bwe_ , \"stone\").[26][27][28] The\nKaranga-speaking Shona people live around Great Zimbabwe in the modern-day\n[province](/wiki/Provinces_of_Zimbabwe \"Provinces of Zimbabwe\") of\n[Masvingo](/wiki/Masvingo_Province \"Masvingo Province\"). Archaeologist [Peter\nGarlake](/wiki/Peter_Garlake \"Peter Garlake\") claims that \"Zimbabwe\"\nrepresents a contracted form of _dzimba-hwe_ , which means \"venerated houses\"\nin the Zezuru dialect of Shona and usually references chiefs' houses or\ngraves.[29]\n\nZimbabwe was formerly known as [Southern Rhodesia](/wiki/Southern_Rhodesia\n\"Southern Rhodesia\") (1898), [Rhodesia](/wiki/Rhodesia \"Rhodesia\") (1965), and\n[Zimbabwe Rhodesia](/wiki/Zimbabwe_Rhodesia \"Zimbabwe Rhodesia\") (1979). The\nfirst recorded use of \"Zimbabwe\" as a term of national reference dates from\n1960 as a coinage by the black nationalist Michael Mawema,[30] whose Zimbabwe\nNational Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961.[31] The\nterm \"Rhodesia\"—derived from the surname of [Cecil Rhodes](/wiki/Cecil_Rhodes\n\"Cecil Rhodes\"), the primary instigator of British colonisation of the\nterritory during the late 19th century—was perceived by African nationalists\nas inappropriate because of its colonial origin and connotations.[30]\n\nAccording to Mawema, black nationalists held a meeting in 1960 to choose an\nalternative name for the country, proposing names such as \"Matshobana\" and\n\"[Monomotapa](/wiki/Monomotapa \"Monomotapa\")\" before his suggestion,\n\"Zimbabwe\", prevailed.[32] A further alternative, put forward by nationalists\nin [Matabeleland](/wiki/Matabeleland \"Matabeleland\"), had been \"Matopos\",\nreferring to the [Matopos Hills](/wiki/Matobo_National_Park \"Matobo National\nPark\") to the south of [Bulawayo](/wiki/Bulawayo \"Bulawayo\").[31]\n\nIt was initially unclear how the chosen term was to be used — a letter written\nby Mawema in 1961 refers to \"Zimbabweland\"[31] — but \"Zimbabwe\" was\nsufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the\nblack nationalist movement.[30] In a 2001 interview, black nationalist [Edson\nZvobgo](/wiki/Edson_Zvobgo \"Edson Zvobgo\") recalled that Mawema mentioned the\nname during a political rally, \"and it caught hold, and that was that\".[30]\nThe black nationalist factions subsequently used the name during the Second\n_[Chimurenga](/wiki/Chimurenga \"Chimurenga\")_ campaigns against the Rhodesian\ngovernment during the [Rhodesian Bush War](/wiki/Rhodesian_Bush_War \"Rhodesian\nBush War\") of 1964–1979. Major factions in this camp included the [Zimbabwe\nAfrican National Union](/wiki/Zimbabwe_African_National_Union \"Zimbabwe\nAfrican National Union\") (led by [Robert Mugabe](/wiki/Robert_Mugabe \"Robert\nMugabe\") from 1975), and the [Zimbabwe African People's\nUnion](/wiki/Zimbabwe_African_People%27s_Union \"Zimbabwe African People's\nUnion\") (led by [Joshua Nkomo](/wiki/Joshua_Nkomo \"Joshua Nkomo\") from its\nfounding in the early 1960s).[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Zimbabwe&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nMain article: [History of Zimbabwe](/wiki/History_of_Zimbabwe \"History of\nZimbabwe\")\n\n### Pre-colonial era\n(1000–1887)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Zimbabwe&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Pre-colonial era \\(1000–1887\\)\")]\n\nFurther information: [Bantu expansion](/wiki/Bantu_expansion \"Bantu\nexpansion\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Tower%2C_Great_Zimbabwe1.jpg/220px-\nTower%2C_Great_Zimbabwe1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tower,_Great_Zimbabwe1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tower,_Great_Zimbabwe1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTowers of [Great Zimbabwe](/wiki/Great_Zimbabwe \"Great Zimbabwe\").\n\nProto-Shona-speaking societies first emerged in the middle Limpopo valley in\nthe 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands. The Zimbabwean\nplateau eventually became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning\naround the 10th century. Around the early 10th century, trade developed with\n[Arab merchants](/wiki/Shirazi_era \"Shirazi era\") on the Indian Ocean coast,\nhelping to develop the [Kingdom of Mapungubwe](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Mapungubwe\n\"Kingdom of Mapungubwe\") in the 11th century. This was the precursor to the\nmore impressive Shona civilisations that would dominate the region during the\n13th to 15th centuries, evidenced by ruins at [Great\nZimbabwe](/wiki/Great_Zimbabwe \"Great Zimbabwe\"), near\n[Masvingo](/wiki/Masvingo \"Masvingo\"), and other smaller sites. The main\narchaeological site uses a unique dry stone architecture.\n\nThe Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of sophisticated trade\nstates developed in Zimbabwe by the time of the first European explorers from\nPortugal. They traded in gold, ivory, and copper for cloth and glass.[33]\n\nFrom about 1300 until 1600, Mapungubwe was eclipsed by the [Kingdom of\nZimbabwe](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Zimbabwe \"Kingdom of Zimbabwe\"). This Shona state\nfurther refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture, which\nsurvives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom's capital of Great Zimbabwe.\nFrom c. 1450 to 1760, Zimbabwe gave way to the [Kingdom of\nMutapa](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Mutapa \"Kingdom of Mutapa\"). This Shona state ruled\nmuch of the area that is known as Zimbabwe today, and parts of central\n[Mozambique](/wiki/Mozambique \"Mozambique\"). It is known by many names\nincluding the [Mutapa Empire](/wiki/Mutapa_Empire \"Mutapa Empire\"), also known\nas _Mwene Mutapa_ or _Monomotapa_ as well as \"Munhumutapa\", and was renowned\nfor its strategic trade routes with the [Arabs](/wiki/Arabs \"Arabs\") and\nPortugal. The Portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a\nseries of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th\ncentury.[33]\n\nAs a direct response to increased [European](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\") presence\nin the interior, and especially due to the increasing amount of Carnegie\nfamily farmers, a new Shona state emerged, known as the [Rozwi\nEmpire](/wiki/Rozwi_Empire \"Rozwi Empire\").

If this rate of growth had been maintained for the\nnext 37 years, Zimbabwe would have in 2016 a GDP of US$52 billion.

The economy declined\nfrom 2000: 5% decline in 2000, 8% in 2001, 12% in 2002 and 18% in 2003.[156]\nZimbabwe's involvement from 1998 to 2002 in the war in the [Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo](/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo \"Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo\") drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the\neconomy.[157] From 1999–2009, Zimbabwe saw the lowest ever economic growth\nwith an annual GDP _decrease_ of 6.1%.[158]\n\nThe downward spiral of the economy has been attributed mainly to mismanagement\nand corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white\nfarmers in the controversial land confiscations of 2000.[159][160][161][162]\nThe Zimbabwean government and its supporters attest that it was Western\npolicies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy.[163]\n\nBy 2005, the purchasing power of the average Zimbabwean had dropped to the\nsame levels in real terms as 1953.[164] In 2005, the government, led by\ncentral bank governor [Gideon Gono](/wiki/Gideon_Gono \"Gideon Gono\"), started\nmaking overtures that white farmers could come back. There were 400 to 500\nstill left in the country, but much of the land that had been confiscated was\nno longer productive.[165] By 2016 there were about 300 farms owned by white\nfarmers left out of the original 4,500. The farms left were either too remote\nor their owners had paid for protection or collaborated with the regime.[87]\n\nIn January 2007, the government issued long term leases to some white\nfarmers.[166] At the same time, however, the government also continued to\ndemand that all remaining white farmers, who were given eviction notices\nearlier, vacate the land or risk being arrested.[167][168] Mugabe pointed to\nforeign governments and alleged \"sabotage\" as the cause of the fall of the\nZimbabwean economy, as well as the country's 80% formal unemployment\nrate.[169]\n\nInflation rose from an annual rate of 32% in 1998, to an official estimated\nhigh of 11,200,000% in August 2008 according to the country's Central\nStatistical Office.[170] This represented a state of\n[hyperinflation](/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe \"Hyperinflation in\nZimbabwe\"), and the central bank introduced a new 100 billion dollar\nnote.[171]\n\nOn 29 January 2009, in an effort to counteract runaway inflation, acting\nFinance Minister [Patrick Chinamasa](/wiki/Patrick_Chinamasa \"Patrick\nChinamasa\") announced that Zimbabweans will be permitted to use other, more\nstable currencies to do business, alongside the Zimbabwe dollar.[172] In an\neffort to combat inflation and foster economic growth the Zimbabwean Dollar\nwas suspended indefinitely on 12 April 2009.[173] In 2016 Zimbabwe allowed\ntrade in the [United States dollar](/wiki/United_States_dollar \"United States\ndollar\") and various other currencies such as the\n[rand](/wiki/South_African_rand \"South African rand\") (South Africa), the\n[pula](/wiki/Botswana_pula \"Botswana pula\") (Botswana), the [euro](/wiki/Euro\n\"Euro\"), and the Pound Sterling (UK).[174]\n\nAfter the formation of the Unity Government and the adoption of several\ncurrencies instead of the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009, the Zimbabwean economy\nrebounded. GDP grew by 8–9% a year between 2009 and 2012.[175] In November\n2010, the IMF described the Zimbabwean economy as \"completing its second year\nof buoyant economic growth\".[176][177] By 2014, Zimbabwe had recovered to\nlevels seen in the 1990s[175] but between 2012 and 2016 growth faltered.[178]\n\nZimplats, the nation's largest platinum company, has proceeded with US$500\nmillion in expansions, and is also continuing a separate US$2 billion project,\ndespite threats by Mugabe to nationalise the company.[179] The pan-African\ninvestment bank [IMARA](/wiki/IMARA \"IMARA\") released a favourable report in\nFebruary 2011 on investment prospects in Zimbabwe, citing an improved revenue\nbase and higher tax receipts.[180]\n\nIn late January 2013, the Zimbabwean finance ministry reported that they had\nonly $217 in their treasury and would apply for donations to finance the\ncoming elections that is estimated to cost 107 million USD.[181][182]\n\nAs of October 2014, [Metallon Corporation](/wiki/Metallon_Corporation\n\"Metallon Corporation\") was Zimbabwe's largest gold miner.[183] The group is\nlooking to increase its production to 500,000 [troy ounces](/wiki/Troy_weight\n\"Troy weight\") per annum by 2019.[183]\n\n### Agriculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Zimbabwe&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Agriculture\")]\n\nZimbabwe's commercial farming sector was traditionally a source of exports and\nforeign exchange, and provided 400,000 jobs. However, the government's land\nreform program badly damaged the sector, turning Zimbabwe into a net importer\nof food products.[2] For example, between 2000 and 2016 annual wheat\nproduction fell from 250,000 tons to 60,000 tons, maize was reduced from two\nmillion tons to 500,000 tons and cattle slaughtered for beef fell from 605,000\nto 244,000.[87] Coffee production, once a prized export commodity came to a\nvirtual halt after seizure or expropriation of white-owned coffee farms in\n2000, and has never recovered.[184]\n\nFor the past ten years, the [International Crops Research Institute for the\nSemi-Arid Tropics](/wiki/International_Crops_Research_Institute_for_the_Semi-\nArid_Tropics \"International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid\nTropics\") ([ICRISAT](/wiki/ICRISAT \"ICRISAT\")) has been assisting Zimbabwe's\nfarmers to adopt [conservation agriculture](/wiki/Conservation_agriculture\n\"Conservation agriculture\") techniques, a sustainable method of farming that\ncan help increase yields. By applying the three principles of minimum soil\ndisturbance, legume-based cropping and the use of organic mulch, farmers can\nimprove infiltration, reduce evaporation and soil erosion, and build up\norganic soil content.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nBetween 2005 and 2011, the number of smallholders practising conservation\nagriculture in Zimbabwe increased from 5000 to more than 150000.

For instance, it currently lacks the critical mass of researchers\nneeded to trigger innovation. Although the infrastructure is in place to\nharness research and development to Zimbabwe’s socio-economic development,\nuniversities and research institutions lack the requisite financial and human\nresources to conduct research and the current regulatory environment hampers\nthe transfer of new technologies to the business sector. The economic crisis\nhas precipitated an exodus of university students and professionals in key\nareas of expertise (medicine, engineering, etc.) that is of growing concern.\nMore than 22% of Zimbabwean tertiary students were completing their degrees\nabroad in 2012, compared to a 4% average for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. In\n2012, there were 200 researchers (head count) employed in the public sector,\none-quarter of whom were women. This is double the continental average (91 in\n2013) but only one-quarter the researcher density of South Africa (818 per\nmillion inhabitants). The government has created the Zimbabwe Human Capital\nWebsite to provide information for the diaspora on job and investment\nopportunities in Zimbabwe.[195][196]\n\nDespite the fact that human resources are a pillar of any research and\ninnovation policy, the _Medium Term Plan_ _2011–2015_ did not discuss any\nexplicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies in science and engineering.\nThe scarcity of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University\nof Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission.[195][196]\n\nNor does the development agenda to 2018, the _Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable\nEconomic Transformation,_ contain any specific targets for increasing the\nnumber of scientists and engineers, or the staffing requirements for industry\nand other productive sectors.

At the end of November 2008,\nsome operations at three of Zimbabwe's four major referral hospitals had shut\ndown, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School, and the fourth major hospital\nhad two [wards](/wiki/Hospital \"Hospital\") and no [operating\ntheatres](/wiki/Operating_theatre \"Operating theatre\") working.[262] Due to\n[hyperinflation](/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe \"Hyperinflation in\nZimbabwe\"), those hospitals still open were not able to obtain basic drugs and\nmedicines.[263] The situation changed drastically after the Unity Government\nand the introduction of the multi-currency system in February 2009 although\nthe political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of the\ndoctors and people with medical knowledge.[264]\n\nIn August 2008 large areas of Zimbabwe were struck by the ongoing\n[cholera](/wiki/Cholera \"Cholera\") epidemic. By December 2008 more than 10,000\npeople had been infected in all but one of Zimbabwe's provinces and the\noutbreak had spread to [Botswana](/wiki/Botswana \"Botswana\"), Mozambique,\nSouth Africa and [Zambia](/wiki/Zambia \"Zambia\").[265][266] On 4 December 2008\nthe [Zimbabwe government](/wiki/Government_of_Zimbabwe \"Government of\nZimbabwe\") declared the outbreak to be a national emergency and asked for\ninternational aid.[267][268]\n\nBy 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 4,011\npeople had succumbed to the waterborne disease since the outbreak began in\nAugust 2008, and the total number of cases recorded had reached 89,018.[269]\nIn [Harare](/wiki/Harare \"Harare\"), the city council offered free graves to\ncholera victims.[270] There had been signs that the disease is abating, with\ncholera infections down by about 50% to around 4,000 cases a week.[269]\n\nThe 2014 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Zimbabwe was 614[175]\ncompared to 960 in 2010–11[175] and 232 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate,\nper 1,000 births was 75 in 2014 (94 in 2009).[175] The number of midwives per\n1,000 live births was unavailable in 2016 and the lifetime risk of death for\npregnant women 1 in 42.[271]\n\n## Education[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Zimbabwe&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit\nsection: Education\")]\n\nMain article: [Education in Zimbabwe](/wiki/Education_in_Zimbabwe \"Education\nin Zimbabwe\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Saint-Georges-\nCollege.jpg/220px-Saint-Georges-College.jpg)](/wiki/File:Saint-Georges-\nCollege.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Saint-Georges-College.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[St George's College, Harare](/wiki/St_George%27s_College,_Harare \"St George's\nCollege, Harare\") was established in 1896 by a French [Jesuit](/wiki/Jesuit\n\"Jesuit\")\n\nDue to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has the\nhighest adult literacy rate in Africa which in 2013 was 90.70%.[272] This is\nlower than the 92% recorded in 2010 by the [United Nations Development\nProgramme](/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme \"United Nations\nDevelopment Programme\")[273][274] and the 97.0% recorded in the 2002 census,\nwhile still substantially higher than 80.4% recorded in the 1992 census.[275]\n\nThe education department has stated that 20,000 teachers have left Zimbabwe\nsince 2007 and that half of Zimbabwe's children have not progressed beyond\nprimary school.[276]\n\nThe wealthier portion of the population usually send their children to\nindependent schools as opposed to the [government-run](/wiki/Government_school\n\"Government school\") schools which are attended by the majority as these are\nsubsidized by the government. School education was made free in 1980, but\nsince 1988, the government has steadily increased the charges attached to\nschool enrollment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in\n1980. The Ministry of Education of Zimbabwe maintains and operates the\ngovernment schools but the fees charged by independent schools are regulated\nby the cabinet of Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabwe's education system consists of 2 years of pre-school, 7 years of\nprimary and 6 years of secondary schooling before students can enter\nuniversity in the country or abroad. The academic year in Zimbabwe runs from\nJanuary to December, with three terms, broken up by one month holidays, with a\ntotal of 40 weeks of school per year. National examinations are written during\nthe third term in November, with [\"O\"\nlevel](/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Education \"General Certificate of\nEducation\") and [\"A\" level](/wiki/Advanced_Level_\\(UK\\) \"Advanced Level\n\\(UK\\)\") subjects also offered in June.[277]\n\nThere are seven public (Government) universities as well as four church-\nrelated universities in Zimbabwe that are fully internationally\naccredited.[277] The [University of Zimbabwe](/wiki/University_of_Zimbabwe\n\"University of Zimbabwe\"), the first and largest, was built in 1952 and is\nlocated in the Harare suburb of [Mount Pleasant](/wiki/Mount_Pleasant,_Harare\n\"Mount Pleasant, Harare\"). Notable [alumni](/wiki/Alumni \"Alumni\") from\nZimbabwean universities include [Welshman Ncube](/wiki/Welshman_Ncube\n\"Welshman Ncube\"); Peter Moyo (of Amabhubesi); [Tendai Biti](/wiki/Tendai_Biti\n\"Tendai Biti\"), [Chenjerai Hove](/wiki/Chenjerai_Hove \"Chenjerai Hove\"),\nZimbabwean poet, novelist and essayist; and [Arthur\nMutambara](/wiki/Arthur_Mutambara \"Arthur Mutambara\"). Many of the current\npoliticians in the government of Zimbabwe have obtained degrees from\nuniversities in USA or other universities abroad.\n\n[National University of Science and\nTechnology](/wiki/National_University_of_Science_and_Technology,_Zimbabwe\n\"National University of Science and Technology, Zimbabwe\") (NUST) is the\nsecond largest public research university in Zimbabwe located in Bulawayo. It\nwas established in 1991. The National University of Science and Technology\nstrives to become a flourishing and reputable institution not only in Zimbabwe\nand in Southern Africa but also among the international fraternity of\nUniversities. Its guidance, cultural values is the encouragement of all its\nmembers and society of those attitudes of fair mindedness, understanding,\ntolerance and respect for people and views which are essential for the\nattainment and maintenance of justice, peace and harmony at all times.\n\n[Africa University](/wiki/Africa_University \"Africa University\") is a United\nMethodist related university institution located in Manicaland which attracts\nstudents from at least 36 African countries. The institution has been growing\nsteadily and has steady study material and learning facilities. The highest\nprofessional board for accountants is the [Institute of Chartered Accountants\nof Zimbabwe](/wiki/Institute_of_Chartered_Accountants_of_Zimbabwe \"Institute\nof Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe\") (ICAZ) with direct relationships with\nsimilar bodies in South Africa, Canada, the UK and Australia. A qualified\n[Chartered Accountant](/wiki/Chartered_Accountant \"Chartered Accountant\") from\nZimbabwe is also a member of similar bodies in these countries after writing a\nconversion paper. In addition, Zimbabwean-trained doctors only require one\nyear of residence to be fully licensed doctors in the United States. The\n[Zimbabwe Institution of Engineers](/wiki/Zimbabwe_Institution_of_Engineers\n\"Zimbabwe Institution of Engineers\") (ZIE) is the highest professional board\nfor engineers.\n\nEducation in Zimbabwe became under threat since the economic changes in 2000\nwith teachers going on strike because of low pay, students unable to\nconcentrate because of hunger and the price of uniforms soaring making this\nstandard a luxury. Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe's\nattacks because he thought they were not strong supporters.[278]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Zimbabwe&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Flag_of_Zimbabwe.svg/32px-Flag_of_Zimbabwe.svg.png)[Zimbabwe portal](/wiki/Portal:Zimbabwe \"Portal:Zimbabwe\")\n\n  * [Education in Zimbabwe](/wiki/Education_in_Zimbabwe \"Education in Zimbabwe\")\n  * [Index of Zimbabwe-related articles](/wiki/Index_of_Zimbabwe-related_articles \"Index of Zimbabwe-related articles\")\n  * [Outline of Zimbabwe](/wiki/Outline_of_Zimbabwe \"Outline of Zimbabwe\")\n\n## Source[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Zimbabwe&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit\nsection: Source\")]\n\n[![Definition of Free Cultural Works logo\nnotext.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_logo_notext.svg/12px-\nDefinition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_logo_notext.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works_logo_notext.svg)\nThis article incorporates text from a [free content](/wiki/Free_content \"Free\ncontent\") work.
