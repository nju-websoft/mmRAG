In\n1990, Shawn fell into a pipe and lost his hearing. With his mother gone, Shawn\nand his father became close with Shawn's doctor and eventually Bo's fiancée,\n[Carly Manning](/wiki/Carly_Manning \"Carly Manning\"). When Bo and Carly's\nengagement ended, Shawn bonded with Bo's new girlfriend, [Billie\nReed](/wiki/Billie_Reed \"Billie Reed\"), who later became Bo's wife. Then,\nShawn's mother, [Hope](/wiki/Hope_Brady \"Hope Brady\"), returned to Salem.\nAlthough Hope did not know who she was at first, her memory returned and Bo\nand Hope reunited. Shawn eventually regained his hearing. At an early age,\nShawn was kidnapped by [Stefano DiMera](/wiki/Stefano_DiMera \"Stefano\nDiMera\"), but escaped. In high school, Shawn competed with [Philip\nKiriakis](/wiki/Philip_Kiriakis \"Philip Kiriakis\") for the romantic affections\nof both [Belle Black](/wiki/Belle_Black \"Belle Black\") and [Chloe\nLane](/wiki/Chloe_Lane \"Chloe Lane\"). [Shawn and Belle](/wiki/Shawn_and_Belle\n\"Shawn and Belle\") became a couple, while Philip and Chloe enjoyed a brief\nromance. The following summer, Shawn and Belle joined other teens from Salem\nHigh on an ill-fated trip to Puerto Rico. While hunting for [Alice\nHorton](/wiki/Alice_Horton \"Alice Horton\")'s missing ruby, Shawn got caught up\nin [Jan Spears](/wiki/Jan_Spears \"Jan Spears\")'s personal tragedy. She became\npregnant after being raped while on the island, and Shawn offered to say he\nwas the father to spare her any additional humiliation, tearing his\nrelationship with Belle apart.\n\nBy the end of senior year, Belle learned the truth, and the two were on the\nbrink of reconciliation. However, impending college careers, the arrival of\n[Rex](/wiki/Rex_Brady \"Rex Brady\") and [Cassie Brady](/wiki/Cassie_Brady\n\"Cassie Brady\"), and old trust issues kept them apart. When Hope and Shawn's\nbaby brother were kidnapped, which brought Belle and Shawn together on a\nmission to find them. However, Philip Kiriakis returned to Salem, and he and\nBelle were matched up on the dating show \"Love is Blind.\"\n\nMore trouble ensued when Jan Spears reared her devious head in Salem. Shawn\nleft Salem distraught and confused by the revelation that Belle's mother,\n[Marlena Evans](/wiki/Marlena_Evans \"Marlena Evans\"), was the Salem Stalker\nand responsible for the death of Shawn's family members. That was just the\nopportunity Jan needed. She cast her net and held Shawn captive in a giant\ncage. This allowed Belle to grow closer to Philip.\n\nOnce Shawn finally escaped, he crashed his motorcycle, leaving him with\namnesia. Jan furthered her evil plans by not only convincing Shawn they were\nin love, but that they were engaged. Fate intervened - Shawn realized his love\nfor Belle, and he crashed his motorcycle through the window of St. Luke's, but\ncouldn't stop her marriage to Philip. Later, Shawn even helped in a rescue\nmission when Philip's troop was taken hostage overseas. He finally moved on\nafter Belle gave birth to Philip's daughter, Claire, although unknown to all,\nClaire was in fact the daughter of Shawn.\n\nFollowing Belle and Philip's wedding, Shawn and [Mimi](/wiki/Mimi_Lockhart\n\"Mimi Lockhart\") explored their feelings for each other. On New Year's Eve\nthey got engaged and later married.\n\nA DNA test proved to all that Shawn was Claire's biological father. This\ncreated a complex predicament for Shawn and Belle, since an in vitro mix-up\nmeant that Belle was carrying a second baby fathered by Shawn.\n\nWhen Shawn learned that Mimi knew he was Claire's father and never told him,\nhe declared their marriage was over and left. Upon hearing that Victor also\nknew the truth about Claire's paternity, he ran a race car through a wall at\nthe Kiriakis mansion and declared that he was done with Victor as well.\n\nBelle lost the baby she was carrying. Shortly afterwards, Shawn misunderstood\na conversation Belle was having with Carrie, leading him to believe she wanted\nnothing to do with him. He found solace with [Willow](/wiki/Willow_Stark\n\"Willow Stark\"), a former hooker, and the two eventually moved in together.\nShawn insisted Willow hide from Belle, which created much tension in their\nrelationship. He still wanted to have a relationship with Claire, and Belle\ntold him the only way was to clear up his life. Staying with Willow out of\nsympathy, which seemed to be a habit with Shawn, he drove Belle further and\nfurther away. After yet another bad decision to work for E.J. Wells as a\ncourier, Bo decided it was time to step in and warn his son.\n\nAfter several run-ins with Willow and Belle, Shawn finally decided to be a\ngood father to Claire and that he needed to quit working for EJ Wells as well\nas break it off with Willow. Shortly after Shawn asked Willow to move out, she\nset fire to the apartment and Shawn was kicked out. Shawn was forced to move\nin with his parents.\n\nJust as Belle and Shawn were getting closer, they were issued court papers\nthat Philip was fighting them for custody. Philip was awarded temporary\ncustody of Claire and devastated Shawn and Belle were ordered to take\nparenting classes. As Victor and Philip left the court room, Shawn overheard\nVictor saying they would never give up Claire now that they have her. Everyone\nknew that Victor had paid off the judge just as he had the Child Protective\nService worker, and even Willow to testify in court against Shawn.\n\nMimi told Shawn just a day later that while at the Kiriakis mansion to\nconfront Philip she saw a passport for Claire. Shawn made the decision that he\nand Belle had to beat Philip and Victor at their own game, by kidnapping\nClaire and going on the run. In the course of a few months they went to Canada\nand then got on a boat to go to Australia. They were pursued by Philip at\nevery corner. They ended up on a small island called Tinda Lau where they\nultimately had to flee from Philip once again. It was in this final pursuit\nthat Philip ruined the engine of their boat and nearly killed everyone\nincluding himself. As they realized that death was a possibility they promised\nthat if they would get out of this to return to Salem as friends and that they\nwould work out an agreeable custody arrangement. During the time of their\nfleeing Philip, Shawn and Belle grew closer and got back together.\n\nBelle asked Philip to help Shawn find a job and so Philip arranged for Shawn\nto get a job with a company that Titan owned, in Ohio - one that would require\nextensive travel. It wasn't long before Shawn found out how he landed the\ninterview and by coincidence, he got a call from Mimi about the baby that\nPhilip was supposed to have with the surrogate mother. On July 4, 2007, Shawn\nwas supposed to have gone to the interview but instead flew out to\nIndianapolis to meet with Lauren, the surrogate mother. Instead of ending the\npregnancy as she said she would, she kept the baby and extorted money from\nBonnie Lockhart until she couldn't do so any longer. This led to Philip\nreceiving harassing phone calls until he confronted Lauren.\n\nOn July 25, 2007, Shawn asked [Belle Black](/wiki/Belle_Black \"Belle Black\")\nto marry him. Temptation and grief over losing her father led Belle to sleep\nwith Philip. On November 23, 2007, Belle and Shawn were married in a ceremony\nat his parents' house. His father did not attend. On December 31, 2007, Belle\nadmitted to Shawn that she slept with Philip. In March 2008, Shawn and Belle\nreconciled and decided to do as Shawn's parents had once done and sail the\nworld to strengthen their marriage and find peace. In October 2011, it was\nmentioned by Hope that she received an email from Shawn, saying that he was\nglad that everything had worked out with his parents and that their\ngranddaughter, Claire, missed them.\n\nShawn briefly returned to Salem in late 2015, much to surprise of his mother,\nat the Brady Pub before leaving again. In January 2016, again returns to\nSalem, with the intentions of being there for his daughter and work things out\nwith Belle. When Belle turns him down, telling him that their marriage is over\nand moves on with her ex-husband [Philip](/wiki/Philip_Kiriakis \"Philip\nKiriakis\"), Shawn gets himself a job at Salem PD, where he meets Lani Price\n([Sal Stowers](/wiki/Sal_Stowers \"Sal Stowers\")). Shawn and Lani date for a\nlittle while, but Shawn and Belle finally decide to give their marriage a\nsecond chance. Therefore Shawn breaks up with Lani. Belle gets a job offer in\nHong Kong. As a result, Shawn and Belle move there. In late 2016, Shawn return\nto Salem as his mother Hope Brady is on trail for the murder of Stefano\nDimera. Shawn sticks around for a while to support his mother, sister Ciara\nand daughter Claire during this difficult time. Hope is let out of prison and\nShawn returns to Belle in Hong Kong. Shawn and Belle return to Salem in\nDecember 2017 to support their daughter after the shooting of her boyfriend\nTheo Carver.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shawn-\nDouglas_Brady&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Supercouple](/wiki/Supercouple \"Supercouple\")\n  * [Shawn Brady and Belle Black](/wiki/Shawn_Brady_and_Belle_Black \"Shawn Brady and Belle Black\")\n  * [Brady Family](/wiki/Brady_family_\\(Days_of_our_Lives\\) \"Brady family \\(Days of our Lives\\)\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shawn-\nDouglas_Brady&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** SOD (March 18, 2015).
