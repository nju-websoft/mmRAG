Those Democrats accepted the label, reinterpreting the\ncopper \"head\" as the likeness of Liberty, which they cut from [Liberty Head\nlarge cent](/wiki/Large_cent_\\(United_States_coin\\)#Braided_Hair \"Large cent\n\\(United States coin\\)\") coins and proudly wore as badges.[1] By contrast,\nDemocratic supporters of the war were called [War\nDemocrats](/wiki/War_Democrats \"War Democrats\"). The Copperheads represented\nthe more extreme wing of the Northern Democrats. Notable Copperheads included\ntwo Democratic Congressmen from Ohio: [Clement L.\nVallandigham](/wiki/Clement_Vallandigham \"Clement Vallandigham\") and\n[Alexander Long](/wiki/Alexander_Long \"Alexander Long\"). Republican\nprosecutors accused some prominent Copperheads of treason in a series of\ntrials in 1864.[2]\n\nCopperheadism was a highly contentious grass-roots movement. It had its\nstrongest base in the area just north of the Ohio River as well as in some\nurban ethnic wards. Some historians have argued that it represented a\ntraditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society\nsponsored by the Republican Party and that it looked back to [Jacksonian\ndemocracy](/wiki/Jacksonian_democracy \"Jacksonian democracy\") for inspiration.\nWeber (2006) argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by\nopposing [conscription](/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States#Civil_War\n\"Conscription in the United States\") (the \"draft\"), encouraging\n[desertion](/wiki/Desertion#American_Civil_War \"Desertion\") and forming\nconspiracies, but other historians say that the draft was already in disrepute\nand that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan\nreasons.\n\nHistorians such as Wood Gray and Jennifer Weber argue that the Copperheads\nwere inflexibly rooted in the past and were naive about the refusal of the\nConfederates to return to the Union. Convinced that the Republicans were\nruining the traditional world they loved, they were obstructionist\npartisans.[3] In turn, the Copperheads became a major target of the [National\nUnion Party](/wiki/National_Union_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"National Union\nParty \\(United States\\)\") in the [1864 presidential\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1864 \"United States\npresidential election, 1864\"), where they were used to discredit the main\nDemocratic candidates. Copperhead support increased when Union armies did\npoorly and decreased when they won great victories. After the [fall of\nAtlanta](/wiki/Battle_of_Atlanta \"Battle of Atlanta\") in September 1864, Union\nmilitary success seemed assured and Copperheadism collapsed.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Agenda\n  * 2 Newspapers\n  * 3 Copperhead resistance\n  * 4 Characteristics\n  * 5 Historiography\n  * 6 Notable Peace Democrats\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 Further reading\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nAgenda[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Copperhead_\\(politics\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Agenda\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/~abe2.jpg/220px-~abe2.jpg)](/wiki/File:~abe2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:~abe2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCopperhead pamphlet from 1864 by [Charles Chauncey\nBurr](/wiki/Charles_Chauncey_Burr \"Charles Chauncey Burr\"), a magazine editor\nfrom New York City[4]\n\nDuring the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Copperheads nominally favored\nthe Union and strongly opposed the war, for which they blamed\n[abolitionists](/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States \"Abolitionism in the\nUnited States\") and they demanded immediate peace and resisted [draft\nlaws](/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States \"Conscription in the United\nStates\"). They wanted President [Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln\n\"Abraham Lincoln\") and the Republicans ousted from power, seeing the President\nas a tyrant destroying American\n[republican](/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States \"Republicanism in the\nUnited States\") values with despotic and arbitrary actions.[5]\n\nSome Copperheads tried to persuade [Union soldiers](/wiki/Union_Army \"Union\nArmy\") to desert. They talked of helping Confederate [prisoners of\nwar](/wiki/Prisoner_of_war \"Prisoner of war\") seize their camps and escape.\nThey sometimes met with Confederate agents and took money. The Confederacy\nencouraged their activities whenever possible.[6]\n\n##\nNewspapers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Copperhead_\\(politics\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Newspapers\")]\n\nThe Copperheads had numerous important newspapers, but the editors never\nformed an alliance. In Chicago, [Wilbur F. Storey](/wiki/Wilbur_F._Storey\n\"Wilbur F. Storey\") made the _[Chicago Times](/wiki/Chicago_Times \"Chicago\nTimes\")_ into Lincoln's most vituperative enemy.[7] The New York _Journal of\nCommerce_ , originally abolitionist, was sold to owners who became\nCopperheads, giving them an important voice in the largest city. A typical\neditor was Edward G. Roddy, owner of the [Uniontown,\nPennsylvania](/wiki/Uniontown,_Pennsylvania \"Uniontown, Pennsylvania\") _Genius\nof Liberty_. He was an intensely partisan Democrat who saw [African\nAmericans](/wiki/African_Americans \"African Americans\") as an inferior race\nand Lincoln as a despot and dunce. Although he supported the war effort in\n1861, he blamed abolitionists for prolonging the war and denounced the\ngovernment as increasingly despotic. By 1864, he was calling for peace at any\nprice.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\n[John Mullaly](/wiki/John_Mullaly \"John Mullaly\")'s _Metropolitan Record_ was\nthe official [Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_the_United_States \"Roman\nCatholicism in the United States\") newspaper in New York City. Reflecting\n[Irish American](/wiki/Irish_American \"Irish American\") opinion, it supported\nthe war until 1863 before becoming a Copperhead organ. In the spring and\nsummer of 1863, the paper urged its Irish working-class readers to pursue\narmed resistance to the draft passed by Congress earlier in the year. When the\ndraft began in the city, working class [European\nAmericans](/wiki/European_Americans \"European Americans\"), largely Irish,\nresponded with [violent riots](/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots \"New York City\ndraft riots\") from July 13 to 16, lynching, beating and hacking to death more\nthan 100 black New Yorkers and burning down black-owned businesses and\ninstitutions, including an orphanage for 233 black children. On August 19,\n1864, John Mullaly was arrested for inciting resistance to the draft.\n\nEven in an era of extremely partisan journalism, Copperhead newspapers were\nremarkable for their angry rhetoric. Wisconsin newspaper editor [Marcus M.\nPomeroy](/wiki/Marcus_M._Pomeroy \"Marcus M. Pomeroy\") of the _La Crosse\nDemocrat_ referred to Lincoln as \"Fungus from the corrupt womb of bigotry and\nfanaticism\" and a \"worse tyrant and more inhuman butcher than has existed\nsince the days of [Nero](/wiki/Nero \"Nero\") [...] The man who votes for\nLincoln now is a traitor and murderer [...] And if he is elected to misgovern\nfor another four years, we trust some bold hand will pierce his heart with\ndagger point for the public good\".[8]\n\n## Copperhead\nresistance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Copperhead_\\(politics\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Copperhead resistance\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Clement_Vallandigham_-\n_Brady-Handy.jpg/170px-Clement_Vallandigham_-_Brady-\nHandy.jpg)](/wiki/File:Clement_Vallandigham_-_Brady-Handy.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Clement_Vallandigham_-_Brady-Handy.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Clement Vallandigham](/wiki/Clement_Vallandigham \"Clement Vallandigham\"),\nleader of the Copperheads, coined the slogan: \"To maintain the Constitution as\nit is, and to restore the Union as it was\"\n\nThe Copperheads sometimes talked of violent resistance and in some cases\nstarted to organize. However, they never actually made an organized attack. As\nwar opponents, Copperheads were suspected of disloyalty and their leaders were\nsometimes arrested and held for months in military prisons without trial. One\nfamous example was General [Ambrose Burnside](/wiki/Ambrose_Burnside \"Ambrose\nBurnside\")'s 1863 [General Order Number 38](/wiki/General_Order_Number_38\n\"General Order Number 38\"), issued in Ohio, which made it an offence (to be\ntried in military court) to criticize the war in any way.[9] The order was\nused to arrest Ohio congressman [Clement L.\nVallandigham](/wiki/Clement_Vallandigham \"Clement Vallandigham\") when he\ncriticized the order itself.[10] However, Lincoln commuted his sentence while\nrequiring his exile to the Confederacy.\n\nProbably the largest Copperhead group was the [Knights of the Golden\nCircle](/wiki/Knights_of_the_Golden_Circle \"Knights of the Golden Circle\").\nFormed in Ohio in the 1850s, it became politicized in 1861. It reorganized as\nthe Order of American Knights in 1863 and again in early 1864 as the Order of\nthe Sons of Liberty, with Vallandigham as its commander. One leader, [Harrison\nH. Dodd](/wiki/Harrison_H._Dodd \"Harrison H. Dodd\"), advocated violent\noverthrow of the governments of Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri in\n1864. Democratic Party leaders and a Federal investigation, thwarted his\nconspiracy. In spite of this Copperhead setback, tensions remained high. The\n[Charleston Riot](/wiki/Charleston_Riot \"Charleston Riot\") took place in\nIllinois in March 1864. Indiana Republicans then used the sensational\nrevelation of an antiwar Copperhead conspiracy by elements of the Sons of\nLiberty to discredit Democrats in the [1864 House\nelections](/wiki/United_States_House_election,_1864 \"United States House\nelection, 1864\"). The military trial of [Lambdin P.\nMilligan](/wiki/Lambdin_P._Milligan \"Lambdin P. Milligan\") and other Sons of\nLiberty revealed plans to set free the Confederate prisoners held in the\nstate. The culprits were sentenced to hang, but the [Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United\nStates\") intervened in _[ex parte Milligan](/wiki/Ex_parte_Milligan \"Ex parte\nMilligan\")_ , saying they should have received civilian trials.[11]\n\nMost Copperheads actively participated in politics. On May 1, 1863, former\nCongressman Vallandigham declared the war was being fought not to save the\nUnion, but to free the blacks and enslave Southern whites. The army then\narrested him for declaring sympathy for the enemy. He was court-martialed by\nthe Army and sentenced to imprisonment, but Lincoln [commuted the\nsentence](/wiki/Commutation_of_sentence \"Commutation of sentence\") to\nbanishment behind Confederate lines.[12] The Democrats nevertheless nominated\nhim for governor of Ohio in 1863. He campaigned from Canada, but lost after an\nintense battle. He operated behind the scenes at the [1864 Democratic\nconvention](/wiki/1864_Democratic_National_Convention \"1864 Democratic\nNational Convention\") in Chicago. This convention adopted a largely Copperhead\nplatform and selected Ohio Representative [George\nPendleton](/wiki/George_H._Pendleton \"George H. Pendleton\") (a known Peace\nDemocrat) as the vice presidential candidate. However, it chose a pro-war\npresidential candidate, General [George B.\nMcClellan](/wiki/George_B._McClellan \"George B. McClellan\"). The contradiction\nseverely weakened the party's chances to defeat Lincoln.\n\n##\nCharacteristics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Copperhead_\\(politics\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Characteristics\")]\n\nThe values of the Copperheads reflected the [Jacksonian\ndemocracy](/wiki/Jacksonian_democracy \"Jacksonian democracy\") of an earlier\nagrarian society. The Copperhead movement attracted Southerners who had\nsettled north of the [Ohio River](/wiki/Ohio_River \"Ohio River\"), the poor and\nmerchants who had lost profitable Southern trade.[13][14] They were most\nnumerous in border areas, including southern parts of Ohio, Illinois and\nIndiana (in Missouri, comparable groups were avowed Confederates).[15]\n\nThe movement has scattered bases of support outside the lower Midwest. There\nwas a Copperhead element in Connecticut that dominated the Democratic Party\nthere.[16] The Copperhead coalition included many [Irish\nAmerican](/wiki/Irish_American \"Irish American\") Catholics in eastern cities,\nmill towns and mining camps (especially in the Pennsylvania coal fields). They\nwere also numerous in [German](/wiki/German_American \"German American\")\nCatholic areas of the [Midwest](/wiki/Midwestern_United_States \"Midwestern\nUnited States\"), especially Wisconsin[17]\n\nHistorian [Kenneth Stampp](/wiki/Kenneth_Stampp \"Kenneth Stampp\") has captured\nthe Copperhead spirit in his depiction of Congressman [Daniel W.\nVoorhees](/wiki/Daniel_W._Voorhees \"Daniel W. Voorhees\") of Indiana:\n\n> There was an earthy quality in Voorhees, \"the tall sycamore of the Wabash.\"\n> On the stump his hot temper, passionate partisanship, and stirring eloquence\n> made an irresistible appeal to the western Democracy [i.e. the Democratic\n> Party]. His bitter cries against [protective tariffs](/wiki/Protectionism\n> \"Protectionism\") and [national banks](/wiki/National_bank \"National bank\"),\n> his intense [race prejudice](/wiki/Racism \"Racism\"), his suspicion of the\n> eastern [Yankee](/wiki/Yankee \"Yankee\"), his devotion to personal\n> [liberty](/wiki/Liberty \"Liberty\"), his defense of the\n> [Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States\n> Constitution\") and [State's rights](/wiki/State%27s_rights \"State's rights\")\n> faithfully reflected the views of his constituents. Like other\n> [Jacksonian](/wiki/Jacksonian_democracy \"Jacksonian democracy\")\n> [agrarians](/wiki/Agrarianism \"Agrarianism\"), he resented the political and\n> economic revolution then in progress. Voorhees idealized a way of life which\n> he thought was being destroyed by the current rulers of his country. His\n> bold protests against these dangerous trends made him the idol of the\n> [Democracy](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party\n> \\(United States\\)\") of the [Wabash Valley](/wiki/Wabash_Valley \"Wabash\n> Valley\").[18]\n\n##\nHistoriography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Copperhead_\\(politics\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Historiography\")]\n\nTwo central questions have run through the historiography of the Copperheads,\ni.e. \"How serious a threat did they pose to the Union war effort and hence to\nthe nation's survival?\" and \"to what extent and with what justification did\nthe Lincoln administration and other Republican officials violate civil\nliberties to contain the perceived menace?\".[19]\n\nThe first book-length scholarly treatment of the Copperheads appeared in 1942.\nIn _The Hidden Civil War_ , Wood Gray decried the \"defeatism\" of the\nCopperheads. He argued they deliberately served the Confederacy's war aims.\nAlso in 1942, George Fort Milton published _Abraham Lincoln and the Fifth\nColumn_ , which likewise condemned the traitorous Copperheads and praised\nLincoln as a model defender of democracy.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[Gilbert R. Tredway](/wiki/Gilbert_R._Tredway \"Gilbert R. Tredway\"), a\nprofessor of history, in his 1973 study _Democratic Opposition to the Lincoln\nAdministration in Indiana_ found most Indiana Democrats were loyal to the\nUnion and desired national reunification. He documented Democratic counties in\nIndiana having outperformed Republican counties in the recruitment of\nsoldiers. Tredway found that Copperhead sentiment was uncommon among the rank-\nand-file Democrats in Indiana.[20]\n\nThe chief historians who favored the Copperheads are [Richard O.\nCurry](/w/index.php?title=Richard_O._Curry&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Richard O.\nCurry \\(page does not exist\\)\") and [Frank L.\nKlement](/w/index.php?title=Frank_L._Klement&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Frank L.\nKlement \\(page does not exist\\)\"). Klement devoted most of his career to\ndebunking the idea that the Copperheads represented a danger to the Union.\nKlement and Curry have downplayed the treasonable activities of the\nCopperheads, arguing the Copperheads were traditionalists who fiercely\nresisted modernization and wanted to return to the old ways. Klement argued in\nthe 1950s that the Copperheads' activities, especially their supposed\nparticipation in treasonous anti-Union secret societies, were mostly false\ninventions by Republican propaganda machines designed to discredit the\nDemocrats at election time. Curry sees Copperheads as poor traditionalists\nbattling against the railroads, banks and modernization. In his standard\nhistory _[Battle Cry of Freedom](/wiki/Battle_Cry_of_Freedom_\\(book\\) \"Battle\nCry of Freedom \\(book\\)\")_ (1988), [James M.\nMcPherson](/wiki/James_M._McPherson \"James M. McPherson\") asserted Klement had\ntaken \"revision a bit too far. There was some real fire under that smokescreen\nof Republican propaganda\".\n\nJennifer Weber's _Copperheads_ (2006) agrees more with Gray and Milton than\nwith Klement. She argues that first. Northern antiwar sentiment was strong, so\nstrong that Peace Democrats came close to seizing control of their party in\nmid-1864. Second, she shows the peace sentiment led to deep divisions and\noccasional violence across the North. Third, Weber concluded that the peace\nmovement deliberately weakened the Union military effort by undermining both\nenlistment and the operation of the draft. Indeed, Lincoln had to divert\ncombat troops to retake control of New York City from the [anti-draft\nrioters](/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots \"New York City draft riots\") in 1863.\nFourth, Weber shows how the attitudes of Union soldiers affected partisan\nbattles back home. The soldiers' rejection of Copperheadism and their\noverwhelming support for Lincoln's reelection in 1864 was decisive in securing\nthe Northern victory and the preservation of the Union. The Copperheads'\nappeal, she argues, waxed and waned with Union failures and successes in the\nfield.\n\n## Notable Peace\nDemocrats[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Copperhead_\\(politics\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Notable Peace Democrats\")]\n\n  * [Jesse D.
