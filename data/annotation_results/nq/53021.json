For Saint [Thomas Aquinas](/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas \"Thomas\nAquinas\"), the dove signifies by its properties each gift of the Holy\nSpirit.[15]\n\n### Roman\nCatholicism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Seven_gifts_of_the_Holy_Spirit&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Roman Catholicism\")]\n\nAlthough the [New Testament](/wiki/New_Testament \"New Testament\") does not\nrefer to Isaiah 11:1-2 regarding these gifts,[16][17] [Roman\nCatholicism](/wiki/Catholic_Church \"Catholic Church\") teaches that initiates\nreceive them at [Baptism](/wiki/Baptism \"Baptism\"), and that they are\nstrengthened at [Confirmation](/wiki/Confirmation \"Confirmation\"), so that one\ncan proclaim the truths of the faith:\n\n    \"The reception of the [sacrament](/wiki/Sacrament \"Sacrament\") of Confirmation is necessary for the completion of baptismal grace.\"[88] For \"by the sacrament of Confirmation, [the baptized] are more perfectly bound to the Church and are enriched with a special strength of the Holy Spirit. Hence they are, as true witnesses of Christ, more strictly obliged to spread and defend the faith by word and deed.\"[89][18]\n\n## The seven gifts of Holy\nSpirit[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Seven_gifts_of_the_Holy_Spirit&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: The seven gifts of Holy Spirit\")]\n\nAccording to the [Catechism of the Catholic\nChurch](/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church \"Catechism of the Catholic\nChurch\"), these gifts \"...complete and perfect the virtues of those who\nreceive them.\"[19]\n\n  * **Wisdom** is considered the first and the greatest of the gifts. It acts upon both the intellect and the will. According to [St. Bernard](/wiki/Bernard_of_Clairvaux \"Bernard of Clairvaux\"), it both illumines the mind and instills an attraction to the divine. Adolphe Tanquerey OP explained the difference between the gift of wisdom and that of understanding, \"...the latter is a view taken by the mind, while the former is an experience undergone by the heart; one is light, the other love, and so they unite and complete one another.\"[20] Wisdom is the perfection of the [theological virtue](/wiki/Theological_virtue \"Theological virtue\") of [charity](/wiki/Charity_\\(practice\\) \"Charity \\(practice\\)\");\n  * **Understanding** is a perceptive intuition which illuminates the mind to grasp the truths of faith. It does not involve a comprehensive understanding of the mysteries of faith, but helps a person understand that these mysteries are credible; compatible with and related to each other; and not unreasonable. The gift of understanding perfects the theological virtue of faith.[21]\n  * **Counsel** functions as a sort of supernatural intuition, to enable a person to judge promptly and rightly, especially in difficult situations. It perfects the [cardinal virtue](/wiki/Cardinal_virtue \"Cardinal virtue\") of [prudence](/wiki/Prudence \"Prudence\"). While prudence operates in accord with reason as enlightened by faith, the gift of counsel operates under the guidance of the Holy Spirit to illuminate the will of God.[22]\n  * **Fortitude** is often identified with courage, but Aquinas takes its meaning to also encompass endurance. [Joseph J. Rickaby](/wiki/Joseph_Rickaby \"Joseph Rickaby\") describes it as a willingness to stand up for what is right in the sight of God, even if it means accepting rejection, verbal abuse, or physical harm. The gift of fortitude allows people the firmness of mind that is required both in doing good and in enduring evil.[23] It is the perfection of the cardinal virtue of the same name.\n  * **Knowledge** : The gift of knowledge allows one, as far as is humanly possible, to see things from God's perspective. It “allows us to perceive the greatness of God and his love for his creatures” through creation.[24]\n  * **Piety** accords with reverence. A person with reverence recognizes his total reliance on God and comes before God with humility, trust, and love. [Thomas Aquinas](/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas \"Thomas Aquinas\") says that piety perfects the virtue of religion, which is an aspect of the virtue of justice, in that it accords to God that which is due him.[25] In a series of talks on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit, [Pope Francis](/wiki/Pope_Francis \"Pope Francis\") said that piety is a recognition of \"...our belonging to God, our deep bond with him, a relationship that gives meaning to our whole life and keeps us resolute, in communion with him, even during the most difficult and troubled moments”.[26] \"Piety is not mere outward religiosity; it is that genuine religious spirit which makes us turn to the Father as his children and to grow in our love for others, seeing them as our brothers and sisters,...\"[27]\n  * **Fear of the Lord** is akin to [wonder](/wiki/Wonder_\\(emotion\\) \"Wonder \\(emotion\\)\") (or [awe](/wiki/Awe \"Awe\")): With the gift of fear of the Lord, one is made aware of the glory and majesty of God. At a June 2014 general audience [Pope Francis](/wiki/Pope_Francis \"Pope Francis\") said that it “is no servile fear, but rather a joyful awareness of God’s grandeur and a grateful realization that only in him do our hearts find true peace”.[28] A person with wonder and awe knows that God is the perfection of all one desires. This gift is described by Aquinas as a fear of separating oneself from God. He describes the gift as a \"filial fear,\" like a child's fear of offending his father, rather than a \"servile fear,\" that is, a fear of punishment. Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. It is the perfection of the theological virtue of [hope](/wiki/Hope \"Hope\").\n\n## Relation to the\nVirtues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Seven_gifts_of_the_Holy_Spirit&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Relation to the Virtues\")]\n\nSaint Thomas Aquinas says that four of these gifts (wisdom, understanding,\nknowledge, and counsel) direct the intellect, while the other three gifts\n(fortitude, piety, and fear of the Lord) direct the will toward God.[29]\n\nIn some respects, the gifts are similar to the [virtues](/wiki/Seven_virtues\n\"Seven virtues\"), but a key distinction is that the virtues operate under the\nimpetus of human reason (prompted by grace), whereas the gifts operate under\nthe impetus of the Holy Spirit; the former can be used when one wishes, but\nthe latter operate only when the Holy Spirit wishes. In the case of Fortitude,\nthe gift has, in Latin and English, the same name as a virtue, which it is\nrelated to but from which it must be distinguished.\n\nIn _[Summa Theologica](/wiki/Summa_Theologica \"Summa Theologica\")_ II.II,\nThomas Aquinas asserts the following correspondences between the seven\n[Capital Virtues](/wiki/Seven_Virtues#Cardinal_and_Theological_Virtues \"Seven\nVirtues\") and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit:[30]\n\n    \n\n  * The gift of wisdom corresponds to the virtue of charity.\n  * The gifts of understanding and knowledge correspond to the virtue of faith.\n  * The gift of counsel (right judgment) corresponds to the virtue of prudence.\n  * The gift of fortitude corresponds to the virtue of courage.\n  * The gift of fear of the Lord corresponds to the virtue of hope.\n  * The gift of Reverence corresponds to the virtue of justice.\n\nTo the virtue of temperance, no Gift is directly assigned; but the gift of\nfear can be taken as such, since fear drives somebody to restrict himself from\nforbidden pleasures.\n\nThe Rev. [Brian Shanley](/wiki/Brian_Shanley \"Brian Shanley\") contrasts the\ngifts to the virtues this way: \"What the gifts do over and above the\ntheological virtues (which they presuppose) is dispose the agent to the\nspecial promptings of the Holy Spirit in actively exercising the life of the\nvirtues; the gifts are necessary for the perfect operations of the virtues,\nespecially in the face of our human weakness and in difficult situations.\"[31]\n\n##\nAugustine[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Seven_gifts_of_the_Holy_Spirit&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Augustine\")]\n\n[St. Augustine](/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo \"Augustine of Hippo\") drew a\nconnection between the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the Beatitudes\n(Matt.5:3-12).\n\n  * _Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven_ , reflects Fear of the Lord as the \"poor in spirit\" are the humble and God-fearing.\n  * _Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted_ , corresponds to the Gift of Knowledge, as for Augustine the knowledge of God brings both an increased awareness of personal sin, and to some extent grieving at the abandonment of practices and activities that separate one from God.\n  * _Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land_ , relates to Piety.\n  * _Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied_ , pertains to Fortitude.\n  * _Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy_ demonstrates the Gift of Counsel.\n  * _Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God_ , the Gift of Understanding.\n  * _Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God_ , Wisdom.\n  * _Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven_.[32]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Seven_gifts_of_the_Holy_Spirit&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Fruit of the Holy Spirit](/wiki/Fruit_of_the_Holy_Spirit \"Fruit of the Holy Spirit\")\n  * [Tree of Jesse](/wiki/Tree_of_Jesse \"Tree of Jesse\")\n  * [Theological virtues](/wiki/Theological_virtues \"Theological virtues\")\n  * [Works of mercy](/wiki/Works_of_mercy \"Works of mercy\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Seven_gifts_of_the_Holy_Spirit&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** For example, see [Victorinus](/wiki/Victorinus_of_Pettau \"Victorinus of Pettau\"), [_Commentarii in Apocalypsim Iohannis_ 1, 4](https://www.scribd.com/doc/124444269/Victorinus-Petavionensis-Episcopus-Scolia-in-Apocalypsin-Beati-Joannis): _Septiformem spiritum in Esaia legimus '(Esa., XI, 2), spiritum' videlicet 'sapientiae et intellectus, consilii et fortitudinis, scientiae et pietatis, spiritum timoris Domini.'_ Authors such [Augustine](/wiki/Augustine \"Augustine\"), [Hilary of Poitiers](/wiki/Hilary_of_Poitiers \"Hilary of Poitiers\"), and [John Cassian](/wiki/John_Cassian \"John Cassian\") all speak of the gifts with familiarity.\n  2. **Jump up ^** Macfarlane, Bruce (2008).
