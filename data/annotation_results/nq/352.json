Undigested\nfood may also be expelled this way, in a process called _egestion_.\n\n[Open defecation](/wiki/Open_defecation \"Open defecation\"), the practice of\ndefecating outside without using a [toilet](/wiki/Toilet \"Toilet\") of any\nkind, is still widespread in some [developing\ncountries](/wiki/Developing_countries \"Developing countries\"), for example in\nIndia.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Description\n    * 1.1 Physiology\n    * 1.2 Voluntary and involuntary control\n  * 2 Posture\n  * 3 Health aspects\n  * 4 Society and culture\n    * 4.1 Anal cleansing after defecation\n    * 4.2 Mythology and tradition\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 Further reading\n\n## Description\n\n### Physiology\n\nThe [rectum ampulla](/wiki/Rectal_ampulla \"Rectal ampulla\") (anatomically\nalso: _ampulla recti_) temporarily stores fecal waste. As the waste fills the\nrectum and expands the rectal walls, [nervous system](/wiki/Nervous_system\n\"Nervous system\") stretch receptors in the rectal walls stimulate the desire\nto defecate. This urge to defecate arises from the reflex contraction of\nrectal muscles, relaxation of the [internal anal\nsphincter](/wiki/Internal_anal_sphincter \"Internal anal sphincter\"), and an\ninitial contraction of the skeletal muscle of the [external anal\nsphincter](/wiki/External_anal_sphincter \"External anal sphincter\"). If the\nurge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the\ncolon by [reverse peristalsis](/wiki/Reverse_peristalsis \"Reverse\nperistalsis\"), where more water is absorbed and the faeces is stored until the\nnext mass peristaltic movement of the transverse and descending colon. If\ndefecation is delayed for a prolonged period the fecal matter may harden,\nresulting in [constipation](/wiki/Constipation \"Constipation\"). If defecation\noccurs too fast, before excess liquid is absorbed, [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea\n\"Diarrhea\") may occur.[2]\n\nWhen the rectum is full, an increase in intra-rectal pressure forces apart the\nwalls of the [anal canal](/wiki/Anal_canal \"Anal canal\"), allowing the fecal\nmatter to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as material is forced into the\nanal canal and peristaltic waves push the feces out of the rectum. The\ninternal and external anal sphincters along with the [puborectalis\nmuscle](/wiki/Puborectalis_muscle \"Puborectalis muscle\") allow the feces to be\npassed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nDefecation is normally assisted by taking a deep breath and trying to expel\nthis air against a closed glottis ([Valsalva maneuver](/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver\n\"Valsalva maneuver\")). This contraction of expiratory [chest](/wiki/Chest\n\"Chest\") muscles, [diaphragm](/wiki/Diaphragm_\\(anatomy\\) \"Diaphragm\n\\(anatomy\\)\"), abdominal wall muscles, and [pelvic](/wiki/Pelvis \"Pelvis\")\ndiaphragm exerts pressure on the digestive tract.\n[Ventilation](/wiki/Ventilation_\\(physiology\\) \"Ventilation \\(physiology\\)\")\nat this point temporarily ceases as the lungs push the chest diaphragm down to\nexert the pressure. Thoracic [blood pressure](/wiki/Blood_pressure \"Blood\npressure\") rises and as a reflex response the amount of blood pumped by the\nheart decreases. Death has been known to occur in cases where defecation\ncauses the blood pressure to rise enough to cause the rupture of an\n[aneurysm](/wiki/Aneurysm \"Aneurysm\") or to dislodge blood clots (see\n[thrombosis](/wiki/Thrombosis \"Thrombosis\")). Also, in releasing the Valsalva\nmaneuver blood pressure falls; this, coupled with standing up quickly to leave\nthe toilet, can result in a blackout.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] [3]\n\nDuring defecation, the external sphincter muscles relax. The anal and\n[urethral sphincter](/wiki/Urethral_sphincter \"Urethral sphincter\") muscles\nare closely linked. Experiments by Harrison Weed at the [Ohio State University\nMedical Center](/wiki/Ohio_State_University_Medical_Center \"Ohio State\nUniversity Medical Center\") have shown they can only be contracted together,\nnot individually, and that both show relaxation during urination.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] This\nexplains why defecation is frequently accompanied by\n[urination](/wiki/Urination \"Urination\").\n\n### Voluntary and involuntary control\n\nDefecation may be involuntary or voluntary. Young children learn voluntary\ncontrol through the process of [toilet training](/wiki/Toilet_training \"Toilet\ntraining\"). Once trained, loss of control, called [fecal\nincontinence](/wiki/Fecal_incontinence \"Fecal incontinence\"), may be caused by\nphysical injury, nerve injury, prior surgeries (such as an\n[episiotomy](/wiki/Episiotomy \"Episiotomy\")),\n[constipation](/wiki/Constipation \"Constipation\"), [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea\n\"Diarrhea\"), loss of storage capacity in the [rectum](/wiki/Rectum \"Rectum\"),\nintense fright, [inflammatory bowel disease](/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease\n\"Inflammatory bowel disease\"), [psychological](/wiki/Psychological\n\"Psychological\") or [neurological](/wiki/Neurological \"Neurological\") factors,\n[childbirth](/wiki/Childbirth \"Childbirth\"), or [death](/wiki/Death\n\"Death\").[4]\n\n## Posture\n\nMain article: [Human defecation postures](/wiki/Human_defecation_postures\n\"Human defecation postures\")\n\nThe positions and modalities of defecation are [culture-\ndependent](/wiki/Culture#Cultures_by_region \"Culture\"). [Squat\ntoilets](/wiki/Squat_toilet \"Squat toilet\") are used by the vast majority of\nthe world, including most of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.[5] The use of\nsit-down [toilets](/wiki/Toilet \"Toilet\") in the [Western\nworld](/wiki/Western_world \"Western world\") is a relatively recent\ndevelopment, beginning in the 19th century with the advent of indoor\nplumbing.[6]\n\n## Health aspects\n\nAttempting forced expiration of breath against a closed airway (the [valsalva\nmaneuver](/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver \"Valsalva maneuver\")) is sometimes practiced\nto induce defecation while on a [toilet](/wiki/Toilet \"Toilet\"). [Cardiac\narrest](/wiki/Cardiac_arrest \"Cardiac arrest\")[7] and other cardiovascular\ncomplications[8] can in rare cases occur due to attempting to defecate using\nthe valsalva maneuver. Valsalva retinopathy is another pathological syndrome\nassociated with the Valsalva maneuver.[9][10]\n\n## Society and culture\n\n### Anal cleansing after defecation\n\nMain article: [Anal cleansing](/wiki/Anal_cleansing \"Anal cleansing\")\n\nThe [anus](/wiki/Anus \"Anus\") and [buttocks](/wiki/Buttocks \"Buttocks\") may be\n[cleansed](/wiki/Anal_cleansing \"Anal cleansing\") after defecation with\n[toilet paper](/wiki/Toilet_paper \"Toilet paper\"), similar paper products, or\nother absorbent material. In many cultures, such as Hindu and Muslim, water is\nused for anal cleansing after defecation, either in addition to using toilet\npaper or exclusively. When water is used for anal cleansing after defecation,\ntoilet paper may be used for drying the area afterwards.\n\n### Mythology and tradition\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Caganer_back.png/160px-\nCaganer_back.png)](/wiki/File:Caganer_back.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Caganer_back.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe _[caganer](/wiki/Caganer \"Caganer\")_ is a defecating figurine in Spanish\n[Nativity scenes](/wiki/Nativity_scene \"Nativity scene\")\n\nSome peoples have culturally significant stories in which defecation plays a\nrole. For example:\n\n  * In an [Alune](/wiki/Alune_people \"Alune people\") and [Wemale](/wiki/Wemale \"Wemale\") legend from the island of [Seram](/wiki/Seram \"Seram\"), [Maluku Province](/wiki/Maluku_Islands \"Maluku Islands\"), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia \"Indonesia\"), the mythical girl [Hainuwele](/wiki/Hainuwele \"Hainuwele\") defecates valuable objects.[11]\n  * One of the [traditions of Catalonia](/wiki/Traditions_of_Catalonia \"Traditions of Catalonia\") ([Spain](/wiki/Spain \"Spain\")) relates to the _[Caganer](/wiki/Caganer \"Caganer\")_ , a [figurine](/wiki/Figurine \"Figurine\") depicting the act of defecation which appears in [nativity scenes](/wiki/Nativity_scene \"Nativity scene\") in [Catalonia](/wiki/Catalonia \"Catalonia\") and neighbouring [areas with Catalan culture](/wiki/Catalan_Countries \"Catalan Countries\"). The exact origin of the _Caganer_ is lost, but the tradition has existed since at least the 18th century.[12]\n\n## See also\n\n  * _[Artist's Shit](/wiki/Artist%27s_Shit \"Artist's Shit\")_\n  * [Constipation](/wiki/Constipation \"Constipation\")\n  * [Hemorrhoid](/wiki/Hemorrhoid \"Hemorrhoid\")\n  * [Rectal tenesmus](/wiki/Rectal_tenesmus \"Rectal tenesmus\") \\- a feeling of incomplete defecation\n  * [Shit](/wiki/Shit \"Shit\")\n\n## References\n\n[![Nuvola kdict glass.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg/40px-Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg) | This article **lacks[ISBNs](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") for the books listed in it**.
