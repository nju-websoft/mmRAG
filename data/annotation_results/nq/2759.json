SAP\nERP incorporates the key business functions of an organization. The latest\nversion (SAP ERP 6.0) was made available in 2006. The most recent Enhancement\nPackage (EHP8) for SAP ERP 6.0 was released in 2016.[3]\n\nBusiness Processes included in SAP ERP are Operations ([Sales](/wiki/Sales\n\"Sales\") & [Distribution](/wiki/Distribution_\\(business\\) \"Distribution\n\\(business\\)\"), [Materials Management](/wiki/Materials_management \"Materials\nmanagement\"), [Production Planning](/wiki/Production_planning \"Production\nplanning\"), [Logistics](/wiki/Logistics \"Logistics\") Execution, and [Quality\nManagement](/wiki/Quality_management \"Quality management\")), Financials\n([Financial Accounting](/wiki/Financial_accounting \"Financial accounting\"),\n[Management Accounting](/wiki/Management_accounting \"Management accounting\"),\nFinancial Supply Chain Management), [Human Capital\nManagement](/wiki/Human_Capital_Management \"Human Capital Management\")\n([Training](/wiki/Training \"Training\"), [Payroll](/wiki/Payroll \"Payroll\"),\ne-Recruiting) and [Corporate Services](/wiki/Corporate_services \"Corporate\nservices\") ([Travel Management](/wiki/Travel_management \"Travel management\"),\n[Environment, Health and Safety](/wiki/Environment,_health_and_safety\n\"Environment, health and safety\"), and [Real-Estate](/wiki/Real_estate \"Real\nestate\") Management).[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Development\n  * 2 Implementation\n  * 3 Deployment and maintenance costs\n  * 4 SAP Transport Management System\n  * 5 ERP advantages and disadvantages\n  * 6 Releases\n    * 6.1 SAP Enhancement Packages for SAP ERP 6.0 (SAP EhPs)\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Development[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SAP_ERP&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Development\")]\n\nAn ERP was built based on the former [SAP R/3](/wiki/SAP_R/3 \"SAP R/3\")\nsoftware. SAP R/3, which was officially launched on 6 July 1992, consisted of\nvarious applications on top of SAP Basis, SAP's set of [middle\nware](/w/index.php?title=Middle_ware&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Middle ware \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\") programs and tools. All applications were built on top of\nthe [SAP Web Application Server](/wiki/SAP_Web_Application_Server \"SAP Web\nApplication Server\"). Extension sets were used to deliver new features and\nkeep the core as stable as possible. The Web Application Server contained all\nthe capabilities of SAP Basis.\n\nA complete architecture change took place with the introduction of mySAP ERP\nin 2004. R/3 Enterprise was replaced with the introduction of ERP Central\nComponent (SAP ECC). The SAP Business Warehouse, SAP Strategic Enterprise\nManagement and Internet Transaction Server were also merged into SAP ECC,\nallowing users to run them under one instance. The SAP Web Application Server\nwas wrapped into SAP [NetWeaver](/wiki/NetWeaver \"NetWeaver\"), which was\nintroduced in 2003. Architectural changes were also made to support an\nenterprise service architecture to transition customers to a [Service-oriented\narchitecture](/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture \"Service-oriented\narchitecture\").[5]\n\nThe latest version, SAP ERP 6.0, was released in 2006. SAP ERP 6.0 has since\nthen been updated through SAP enhancement packs, the most recent: SAP\nenhancement package 8 for SAP ERP 6.0 in 2016...\n\n## Implementation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SAP_ERP&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Implementation\")]\n\nSAP ERP consists of several modules, including Financial Accounting (FI),\nControlling (CO), Asset Accounting (AA), Sales & Distribution (SD), Material\nManagement (MM), Product Planning (PP), Quality Management (QM), Project\nSystem (PS), Plant Maintenance (PM), Human Resources (HR).[6] SAP ERP collects\nand combines data from the separate modules to provide the company or\norganization with enterprise resource planning.\n\nTypical implementation phases:[7]\n\n  * Phase 1 - Project Preparation\n  * Phase 2 - Business Blueprint\n  * Phase 3 - Realization\n  * Phase 4 - Final Preparation\n  * Phase 5 - Golive Support\n\nCompanies planning to implement or upgrade an SAP ERP system should pay strict\nattention to system integration to save their SAP ERP implementation from\nfailure. With system integration in place, data flows move completely and\ncorrectly among various SAP ERP components, thereby not only streamlining\nbusiness processes but also eliminating or minimizing redundant data entry\nefforts.[8]\n\nAnalyst firm [Gartner](/wiki/Gartner \"Gartner\") estimates that 55% to 75% of\nall ERP projects fail to meet their objectives…Of the top 10 barriers to a\nsuccessful ERP journey, 5 can be addressed by developing and implementing a\nstructured change management\nprogram.[[1]](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/mx/Documents/human-\ncapital/01_ERP_Top10_Challenges.pdf)\n\n## Deployment and maintenance\ncosts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SAP_ERP&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section:\nDeployment and maintenance costs\")]\n\nIt is estimated that \"for a Fortune 500 company, software, hardware, and\nconsulting costs can easily exceed $100 million (around $50 million to $500\nmillion). Large companies can also spend $50 million to $100 million on\nupgrades. Full implementation of all modules can take years,\" which also adds\nto the end price. Midsized companies (fewer than 1,000 employees) are more\nlikely to spend around $10 million to $20 million at most, and small companies\nare not likely to have the need for a fully integrated SAP ERP system unless\nthey have the likelihood of becoming midsized and then the same data applies\nas would a midsized company.[9] Independent studies have shown that deployment\nand maintenance costs of a SAP solution can greatly vary depending on the\norganization. For example, some point out that because of the rigid model\nimposed by SAP tools, a lot of customization code to adapt to the business\nprocess may have to be developed and maintained.[10] Some others pointed out\nthat a [return on investment](/wiki/Return_on_investment \"Return on\ninvestment\") could only be obtained when there was both a sufficient number of\nusers and sufficient frequency of use.[11][12] Deploying SAP itself can also\ninvolve a lot of time and resources.[13]\n\n## SAP Transport Management\nSystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SAP_ERP&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section:\nSAP Transport Management System\")]\n\nSAP Transport Management System (TMS) is a tool within SAP ERP systems to\nmanage software updates, termed _[transports](/wiki/Transport_\\(SAP\\)\n\"Transport \\(SAP\\)\")_ , on one or more connected SAP systems. This should not\nbe confused with SAP Transportation Management, a stand-alone module for\nfacilitating logistics and supply chain management in the transportation of\ngoods and materials.\n\n## ERP advantages and\ndisadvantages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SAP_ERP&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: ERP advantages and disadvantages\")]\n\nAdvantages\n\n  * Allows easier global integration (barriers of currency exchange rates, language, and culture can be bridged automatically)\n  * Updates only need to be done once to be implemented company-wide\n  * Provides real-time information, reducing the possibility of redundancy errors\n  * May create a more efficient work environment for employees[9]\n  * Vendors have past knowledge and expertise on how to best build and implement a system\n  * [User interface](/wiki/User_interface \"User interface\") is completely customizable allowing end users to dictate the operational structure of the product\n\nDisadvantages\n\n  * Locked into relationship by contract and manageability with vendor - a contract can hold a company to the vendor until it expires and it can be unprofitable to switch vendors if [switching costs](/wiki/Switching_barriers \"Switching barriers\") are too high\n  * Inflexibility - vendor packages may not fit a company's business model well and customization can be expensive\n  * [Return on Investment](/wiki/Rate_of_return \"Rate of return\") may take too long to be profitable\n  * Implementations have a risk of project failure[9]\n\n## Releases[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SAP_ERP&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Releases\")]\n\n  * SAP R/1 System RF: 1973\n  * [SAP R/2](/wiki/SAP_R/2 \"SAP R/2\") Mainframe System: 1979\n  * [SAP R/3](/wiki/SAP_R/3 \"SAP R/3\") Enterprise Edition 1.0 A: July 1992\n  * SAP R/3 Enterprise Edition 3.0B (SAP R/3 4.0B): 6 April 1998\n  * SAP R/3 Enterprise Edition 3.1l (SAP R/3 3.1I): 11 May 1998\n  * SAP R/3 Enterprise Edition 4.3 (SAP R/3 4.3): June 1998\n  * SAP R/3 Enterprise Edition 4.5B (SAP R/3 4.5B): 29 March 1999\n  * SAP R/3 Enterprise Edition 4.6B (SAP R/3 4.6B): 6 December 1999\n  * SAP R/3 Enterprise Edition 4.6C (SAP R/3 4.6C): 3 April 2000\n  * SAP R/3 Enterprise Edition 4.6F\n  * SAP R/3 ENTERPRISE 47X110: 15 July 2002\n  * SAP R/3 ENTERPRISE 47X200: 22 September 2003\n  * SAP ERP Central Component (ECC) 5.0: 21 June 2004\n  * SAP ERP Central Component (ECC) 6.0: 24 October 2005\n\n### SAP Enhancement Packages for SAP ERP 6.0 (SAP\nEhPs)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SAP_ERP&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section:\nSAP Enhancement Packages for SAP ERP 6.0 \\(SAP EhPs\\)\")]\n\nThe latest version (SAP ERP 6.0) was made available in 2006. Since then,\nadditional functionality for SAP ERP 6.0 has been delivered through SAP\nEnhancement Packages (EhP).[14] These Enhancement Packages allow SAP ERP\ncustomers to manage and deploy new software functionality.[15] Enhancement\nPackages are optional; customers choose which new capabilities to\nimplement.[16]\n\nSAP EhPs do not require a classic system upgrade.[17] The\n[installation](/wiki/Installation_\\(computer_programs\\) \"Installation\n\\(computer programs\\)\") process of Enhancement Packages consists of two\ndifferent steps:\n\n  * Technical installation of an Enhancement Package\n  * Activation of new functions\n\nThe technical installation of business functions does not change the system\nbehavior. The installation of new functionalities is decoupled from its\nactivation and companies can choose which business functions they want to\nactivate. This means that even after installing a new business function, there\nis no change to existing functionality before activation. Activating a\nbusiness function for one process will have no effect on users working with\nother functionalities.[18] The most recent SAP Enhancement Package for SAP ERP\n6.0 was EhP8, which was released in 2016. EhP8 delivers innovations and serves\nas a foundation to transition to SAP’s new business suite: [SAP\nS/4HANA](/wiki/SAP_S/4HANA \"SAP S/4HANA\").[19]\n\nSAP EhP Releases\n\n  * SAP enhancement package 1 for SAP ERP 6.0 (EHP1 FOR SAP ERP 6.0): 21 December 2006\n  * SAP enhancement package 2 for SAP ERP 6.0 (EHP2 FOR SAP ERP 6.0): 27 July 2007\n  * SAP enhancement package 3 for SAP ERP 6.0 (EHP3 FOR SAP ERP 6.0): 7 December 2007\n  * SAP enhancement package 4 for SAP ERP 6.0 (EHP4 FOR SAP ERP 6.0): 21 November 2008\n  * SAP enhancement package 4 for SAP ERP 6.0 on SAP enhancement package for SAP NetWeaver 7.0 (EHP4 FOR SAP ERP 6.0 / NW7.01): 21 November 2008\n  * SAP enhancement package 5 for SAP ERP 6.0 (EHP5 FOR SAP ERP 6.0): 12 July 2010\n  * SAP enhancement package 6 for SAP ERP 6.0 (EHP6 FOR SAP ERP 6.0): 24 August 2011\n  * SAP enhancement package 7 for SAP ERP 6.0 (EHP7 FOR SAP ERP 6.0): 13 August 2013\n  * SAP Fiori 1.0 for SAP ERP (UI FOR EHP7 FOR SAP ERP 6.0): 29 November 2013\n  * SAP enhancement package 8 for SAP ERP 6.0 (EHP8 FOR SAP ERP 6.0): 20 January 2016\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SAP_ERP&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [SAP NetWeaver](/wiki/SAP_NetWeaver \"SAP NetWeaver\")\n  * [SOA](/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture \"Service-oriented architecture\")\n  * [List of ERP software packages](/wiki/List_of_ERP_software_packages \"List of ERP software packages\")\n  * [SAPgui](/wiki/SAPgui \"SAPgui\")\n  * [Secure Network Communications](/wiki/Secure_Network_Communications \"Secure Network Communications\")\n  * [Secure Socket Layer](/wiki/Secure_Socket_Layer \"Secure Socket Layer\")\n  * [T-code](/wiki/T-code \"T-code\")\n  * [GuiXT](/wiki/GuiXT \"GuiXT\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SAP_ERP&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Lextrait, Vincent (January 2010).
