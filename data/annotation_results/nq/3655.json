[Wetlands](/wiki/Wetlands \"Wetlands\") and marshy\nconditions are found close to the Dutch border and along the\n[Frisian](/wiki/Frisia \"Frisia\") coast. Sandy [Mecklenburg](/wiki/Mecklenburg\n\"Mecklenburg\") in the northeast has many glacier-formed\n[lakes](/wiki/Mecklenburg_Lake_District \"Mecklenburg Lake District\") dating to\nthe [last glacial period](/wiki/Last_glacial_period \"Last glacial period\").\n\nMoving south, central Germany features rough and somewhat patternless hilly\nand mountainous countryside, some of it formed by ancient\n[volcanic](/wiki/Volcano \"Volcano\") activity. The [Rhine](/wiki/Rhine \"Rhine\")\nvalley cuts through the western part of this region. The central uplands\ncontinue east and north as far as the [Saale](/wiki/Saale \"Saale\") and merge\nwith the [Ore Mountains](/wiki/Ore_Mountains_\\(Germany\\) \"Ore Mountains\n\\(Germany\\)\") on the border with the [Czech Republic](/wiki/Czech_Republic\n\"Czech Republic\"). Upland regions include the [Eifel](/wiki/Eifel \"Eifel\"),\n[Hunsrück](/wiki/Hunsr%C3%BCck \"Hunsrück\") and [Palatine\nForest](/wiki/Palatine_Forest \"Palatine Forest\") west of the Rhine, the\n[Taunus](/wiki/Taunus \"Taunus\") hills north of [Frankfurt](/wiki/Frankfurt\n\"Frankfurt\"), the [Vogelsberg](/wiki/Vogelsberg \"Vogelsberg\") massif, the\n[Rhön](/wiki/Rh%C3%B6n \"Rhön\"), and the [Thüringer\nWald](/wiki/Th%C3%BCringer_Wald \"Thüringer Wald\"). South of\n[Berlin](/wiki/Berlin \"Berlin\"), the east-central part of the country is more\nlike the low northern areas, with sandy soil and river wetlands such as the\n[Spreewald](/wiki/Spreewald \"Spreewald\") region.\n\nSouthern Germany's landforms are defined by various linear hill and mountain\nranges like the two adjacent ranges of the [Swabian](/wiki/Swabian_Alb\n\"Swabian Alb\") and [Franconian Alb](/wiki/Franconian_Alb \"Franconian Alb\")\n(reaching approximately from the source of the [Danube](/wiki/Danube \"Danube\")\nin the southwest of [Baden-Württemberg](/wiki/Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg \"Baden-\nWürttemberg\"), south of [Stuttgart](/wiki/Stuttgart \"Stuttgart\"), across\n[Swabia](/wiki/Swabia \"Swabia\") into [Central\nFranconia](/wiki/Central_Franconia \"Central Franconia\") and to the valley of\nthe river [Main](/wiki/Main_\\(river\\) \"Main \\(river\\)\")) and the [Bavarian\nForest](/wiki/Bavarian_Forest \"Bavarian Forest\") along the border between\nBavaria and the Czech Republic.

There is sooner a stronger West-\nEast temperature factor instead. This is explained by the North's flat and\nopen landscapes and its closeness to the sea, and South's higher terrain,\nlarger distance from the sea, and the [Alps](/wiki/Alps \"Alps\"). These\nmountains prevents much of the usually warmer\n[Mediterranean](/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea \"Mediterranean Sea\") air to blow up\ninto southern Germany. And north of the Alps and the\n[Carpathians](/wiki/Carpathians \"Carpathians\"), the farther away from the\n[Atlantic Ocean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean \"Atlantic Ocean\") with for its Latitudes\nwarm current, known as the [Gulfstream](/wiki/Gulf_Stream \"Gulf Stream\") \\-\nand the closer to [Russia](/wiki/Russia \"Russia\")'s and\n[Siberia](/wiki/Siberia \"Siberia\")'s extremely cold winter winds, one gets,\nthe local climate becomes colder, even at the same Latitude and altitude. Even\nif Siberian winter winds are not dominating, when they do hit Germany,\ntemperatures can in extreme cases fall to -30 C and below during the nights,\nand this has an effect on the average temperatures of November to March.\nAlthough rare, when such cold air reaches Germany, the Eastern parts becomes\nmore affected compared to the Western parts. These factors results in, that\n[Hamburg](/wiki/Hamburg \"Hamburg\") in the North has the same annual average\ntemperature as [Munich](/wiki/Munich \"Munich\") in the South has. The annual\naverage temperature in Hamburg is +9.5 C and +9.7 in Munich [3] Whilst\n[Berlin](/wiki/Berlin \"Berlin\") has an annual average temperature +9,9 C [4]\n\nThe warmest area in Germany is the area bordering to [France](/wiki/France\n\"France\") and west of the [Schwartzwald](/wiki/Schwartzwald \"Schwartzwald\")\nhills. Roughly between [Karlsruhe](/wiki/Karlsruhe \"Karlsruhe\") in the north,\nand down to the [Swiss](/wiki/Switzerland \"Switzerland\") border. Whilst the\ncoldest area (except for mountain peaks) is found in the southeastern parts of\neastern Germany, around [Dresden](/wiki/Dresden \"Dresden\") and\n[Görlitz](/wiki/G%C3%B6rlitz \"Görlitz\"); roughly just two Latitudes higher.\nBut the difference at annual average base, isn't extreme. [Freiburg im\nBreisgau](/wiki/Freiburg_im_Breisgau \"Freiburg im Breisgau\") (located a little\nsouth of Karlsruhe) has an averare annual temperature of +11.4 C,\n[Görlitz](/wiki/G%C3%B6rlitz \"Görlitz\") has an equal value of +8.8 C. A\ndifference of 2.6 degree C. [5] Colder meteorological stations in Germany can\nbe found, but mainly at notably higher altitudes.\n\nGermany's [climate](/wiki/Climate \"Climate\") is [temperate](/wiki/Temperate\n\"Temperate\") and [marine](/wiki/Oceanic_climate \"Oceanic climate\"), with cold,\ncloudy, wet winters and moderate warm summers and in the south occasional warm\n[föhn wind](/wiki/F%C3%B6hn_wind \"Föhn wind\"). The greater part of Germany\nlies in the cool/temperate climatic zone in which humid westerly winds\npredominate. In the northwest and the north, the climate is oceanic and rain\nfalls all the year round. Winters there are relatively mild and summers\ncomparatively cool. In the east, the climate shows clear continental features;\nwinters can be very cold for long periods, and summers can become very warm.\nDry periods are often recorded.\n\nIn the centre and the south, there is a transitional climate which may be\npredominantly oceanic or continental, according to the general weather\nsituation. Winters are mild and summers tend to be cool, though maximum\ntemperatures can exceed 30 [°C](/wiki/Celsius \"Celsius\") (86\n[°F](/wiki/Fahrenheit \"Fahrenheit\")) for several days in a row during heat\nwaves. The warmest regions of Germany can be found in the south-west (see\n[rhine rift](/wiki/Rhine_rift \"Rhine rift\"), [German Wine\nRoute](/wiki/German_Wine_Route \"German Wine Route\") and\n[Palatinate](/wiki/Palatinate_\\(region\\) \"Palatinate \\(region\\)\")). Here\nsummers can be hot with many days exceeding 30 [°C](/wiki/Celsius \"Celsius\")\n(86 [°F](/wiki/Fahrenheit \"Fahrenheit\")).
