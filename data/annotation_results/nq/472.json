The\nwishbone-shaped loop of Three Rivers Park encompasses the Pittsburgh Peninsula\nand Point State Park at its center, and spans over 13 miles of interconnected\ntrails and green space with over 800 acres of public open space.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Overview\n  * 2 Completed segments\n  * 3 History of development\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Overview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Three_Rivers_Park&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Overview\")]\n\nThree Rivers Park is composed of several capital projects, with Riverlife,\nformerly known as [Riverlife Task Force](/wiki/Riverlife_Task_Force \"Riverlife\nTask Force\") overseeing implementation of the park with the cooperation of\npublic and private property owners and community groups. The park is being\ndesigned to open the three rivers to public access in a way that was\nimpossible during Pittsburgh's [Industrial Age](/wiki/Industrialization\n\"Industrialization\"). Three Rivers Park offers continuous trails and green\nspace along a more than 13-mile waterfront loop. Contained within the project\nsite boundaries are shorelines, public and private property, and several\nbridges. The Three Rivers Heritage Trail regional trail system runs through\nthe park, as does the multi-state Great Allegheny Passage trail.\n\nThe logo of Three Rivers Park is the outline shape of [Fort\nPitt](/wiki/Fort_Pitt_\\(Pennsylvania\\) \"Fort Pitt \\(Pennsylvania\\)\"), the 18th\ncentury outpost of the [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\")\nat the [confluence](/wiki/Confluence_\\(geography\\) \"Confluence \\(geography\\)\")\nof the Monongahela, Allegheny, and Ohio Rivers. The design aims to capture the\nhistorical significance of Pittsburgh, with added graphic elements of water\nand leaf shapes to acknowledge the region's [natural\nhistory](/wiki/Natural_history \"Natural history\"). The logo appears on\n[signage](/wiki/Signage \"Signage\") throughout Three Rivers Park and mile\nmarkers embedded in the trail which reference Point State Park's fountain as\nMile 0.\n\n## Completed\nsegments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Three_Rivers_Park&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Completed segments\")]\n\n  * [North Shore Riverfront Park](/wiki/North_Shore_Riverfront_Park \"North Shore Riverfront Park\")\n  * [Allegheny Riverfront Park](/wiki/Allegheny_Riverfront_Park \"Allegheny Riverfront Park\")\n  * [Point State Park](/wiki/Point_State_Park \"Point State Park\")\n  * [South Shore Riverfront Park](/wiki/South_Shore_Riverfront_Park \"South Shore Riverfront Park\")\n  * [Station Square](/wiki/Station_Square \"Station Square\")\n  * [Mon Wharf Landing](/w/index.php?title=Mon_Wharf_Landing&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Mon Wharf Landing \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n  * [Strip District Riverfront Trail](/w/index.php?title=Strip_District_Riverfront_Trail&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Strip District Riverfront Trail \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n  * [Washington's Landing](/wiki/Washington%27s_Landing \"Washington's Landing\")\n  * [David L.

The winning firm chosen was Chan Krieger\nSieniewicz of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Chan Krieger and Riverlife held dozens\nof public meetings to garner feedback from Pittsburgh citizens about the\nfuture of the riverfronts. The vision for Three Rivers Park was first unveiled\nin Riverlife’s 2001 \"A Vision Plan for Pittsburgh’s Riverfronts.\" The vision\nplan was accepted by the City of Pittsburgh.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Three_Rivers_Park&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Pittsburgh_city_coat_of_arms.svg/20px-Pittsburgh_city_coat_of_arms.svg.png)[Pittsburgh portal](/wiki/Portal:Pittsburgh \"Portal:Pittsburgh\")\n\n  * [Parks in Pittsburgh](/wiki/Category:Parks_in_Pittsburgh \"Category:Parks in Pittsburgh\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Three_Rivers_Park&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  * Patricia Lowry (2007).
