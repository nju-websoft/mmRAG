His friend [Lowell Mason](/wiki/Lowell_Mason \"Lowell Mason\")\nhad asked him to translate the lyrics in some German school songbooks or to\nwrite new lyrics. A melody in [Muzio Clementi](/wiki/Muzio_Clementi \"Muzio\nClementi\")'s Symphony No. 3 (also called 'The Great National' and contains the\nmelody of 'God Save the Queen' as a tribute to Clementi's adopted country)\ncaught his attention. Rather than translating the lyrics from German, Smith\nwrote his own American patriotic hymn to the melody, completing the lyrics in\nthirty minutes.\n\nSmith gave Mason the lyrics he had written and the song was first performed in\npublic on July 4, 1831,[4] at a children's [Independence\nDay](/wiki/Independence_Day_\\(United_States\\) \"Independence Day \\(United\nStates\\)\") celebration at [Park Street Church](/wiki/Park_Street_Church \"Park\nStreet Church\") in Boston.
