held by WWE and is\ntypically shown on [pay-per-view](/wiki/Pay-per-view \"Pay-per-view\").[10] The\nevent is highlighted by the Royal Rumble match, a [battle\nroyal](/wiki/Battle_royal_\\(professional_wrestling\\) \"Battle royal\n\\(professional wrestling\\)\") whose participants enter at timed intervals.[11]\nThe Greatest Royal Rumble included the largest version of the match to date,\nhaving a total of 50 participants.\n\nOn March 5, 2018, WWE and the [Saudi General Sports\nAuthority](/wiki/General_Sports_Authority \"General Sports Authority\")\nadvertised the Greatest Royal Rumble, a live event to be held on April 27,\n2018, at King Abdullah International Stadium, part of the King Abdullah Sports\nCity, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.[12][13] The event is a part of a 10-year\nstrategic multi-platform partnership between WWE and the Saudi General Sports\nAuthority in support of [Saudi Vision 2030](/wiki/Saudi_Vision_2030 \"Saudi\nVision 2030\"), Saudi Arabia's social and economic reform program.[3][14]\n\nOn March 19, 2018, WWE scheduled seven championship matches for the event: the\n[WWE Championship](/wiki/WWE_Championship \"WWE Championship\"), [Universal\nChampionship](/wiki/WWE_Universal_Championship \"WWE Universal Championship\"),\n[United States Championship](/wiki/WWE_United_States_Championship \"WWE United\nStates Championship\"), [Intercontinental\nChampionship](/wiki/WWE_Intercontinental_Championship \"WWE

were to be defended at the event.\n\nAs revealed on March 22, 2018, the event was streamed live on the WWE\nNetwork.[6] It also aired on traditional pay-per-view in the United States[15]\nand internationally.[4] The event was also the first WWE pay-per-view to\nfeature [Arabic](/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic \"Modern Standard Arabic\")\ncommentary.[16]\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the event, the WWE held tryouts in Saudi Arabia.\nFrom these tryouts, eight were selected to receive training by WWE, which\nwould include an opportunity to earn a spot at the Greatest Royal Rumble event\nitself.[17]\n\n###\nStorylines[[edit](/w/index.php?title=WWE_Greatest_Royal_Rumble&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Storylines\")]\n\nThe card comprised ten matches that resulted from scripted storylines and had\nresults predetermined by [WWE](/wiki/WWE \"WWE\") on the\n[Raw](/wiki/Raw_\\(WWE_brand\\) \"Raw \\(WWE brand\\)\") and\n[SmackDown](/wiki/SmackDown_\\(WWE_brand\\)

to defend the Universal Championship against\n[Roman Reigns](/wiki/Roman_Reigns \"Roman Reigns\") in a [steel cage\nmatch](/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types#Steel_cage_match \"Professional\nwrestling match types\") as a rematch from [WrestleMania\n34](/wiki/WrestleMania_34 \"WrestleMania 34\").[22][23] On _Raw_ following\nWrestleMania, Reigns expressed frustration about not being told about his\nfuture matches and opponents, singling out the steel cage match with Lesnar.\nReigns alleged that there was a conspiracy against him. [Samoa\nJoe](/wiki/Samoa_Joe \"Samoa Joe\"), who had been out with an injury since\nJanuary, came out and warned Reigns that Lesnar would beat him again.[24]\n\nOn March 26, WWE scheduled a [ladder match](/wiki/Ladder_match \"Ladder match\")\nbetween then-champion [The Miz](/wiki/The_Miz \"The Miz\"), [Seth\nRollins](/wiki/Seth_Rollins \"Seth Rollins\"), [Finn\nBálor](/wiki/Finn_B%C3%A1lor \"Finn Bálor\"), and Samoa Joe for the\nIntercontinental Championship.[25] At WrestleMania 34, The Miz lost the\nIntercontinental Championship to Rollins, thus making Rollins the defending\nchampion.[26] Both Miz and Joe were [traded\nto](/wiki/2018_WWE_Superstar_Shake-up \"2018 WWE Superstar Shake-up\") SmackDown\nwhile Rollins and Bálor remained on Raw.[27][28]\n\nOn March 26, [Cesaro and Sheamus](/wiki/Cesaro_and_Sheamus \"Cesaro and\nSheamus\") were scheduled to defend the Raw Tag Team Championship against [The\nHardy Boyz](/wiki/The_Hardy_Boyz \"The Hardy Boyz\") ([Jeff](/wiki/Jeff_Hardy\n\"Jeff Hardy\") and [Matt Hardy](/wiki/Matt_Hardy \"Matt Hardy\")).[25] At\nWrestleMania 34, however, Cesaro and Sheamus lost the titles to [Braun\nStrowman](/wiki/Braun_Strowman \"Braun Strowman\") and 10-year-old Nicholas.[26]\nThe following night on _Raw_ , Strowman and Nicholas relinquished the titles\ndue to Nicholas being a fourth grader. Cesaro and Sheamus demanded their\ntitles back, but Raw General Manager [Kurt Angle](/wiki/Kurt_Angle \"Kurt\nAngle\") instead scheduled them to face the winner of the four-team Tag Team\nEliminator tournament for the vacant titles at the Greatest Royal Rumble.[24]\n[\"Woken\" Matt Hardy](/wiki/Matt_Hardy \"Matt Hardy\") and [Bray\nWyatt](/wiki/Bray_Wyatt \"Bray Wyatt\") won the tournament by defeating Titus\nWorldwide ([Apollo Crews](/wiki/Apollo_Crews \"Apollo Crews\") and [Titus\nO'Neil](/wiki/Titus_O%27Neil \"Titus O'Neil\")) and [The\nRevival](/wiki/The_Revival_\\(professional_wrestling\\) \"The Revival\n\\(professional wrestling\\)\") ([Dash Wilder](/wiki/Dash_Wilder \"Dash Wilder\")\nand [Scott Dawson](/wiki/Scott_Dawson_\\(wrestler\\) \"Scott Dawson\n\\(wrestler\\)\")).[27] Cesaro and Sheamus were then traded to SmackDown during\nthe Superstar Shake-up.[28]\n\nAt WrestleMania 34, [The Bludgeon Brothers](/wiki/The_Bludgeon_Brothers \"The\nBludgeon Brothers\") ([Harper](/wiki/Luke_Harper \"Luke Harper\") and\n[Rowan](/wiki/Erick_Rowan \"Erick Rowan\")) defeated [The Usos](/wiki/The_Usos\n\"The Usos\") (Jey and Jimmy Uso) and [The New\nDay's](/wiki/The_New_Day_\\(professional_wrestling\\) \"The New Day\n\\(professional wrestling\\)\") [Big E](/wiki/Big_E_\\(wrestler\\) \"Big E\n\\(wrestler\\)\") and [Kofi Kingston](/wiki/Kofi_Kingston \"Kofi Kingston\") in a\ntriple threat tag team match to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship.[26]\nOn the following _SmackDown_ , The Usos defeated The New Day to earn a title\nmatch at Greatest Royal Rumble.[29]\n\nA match between [John Cena](/wiki/John_Cena \"John Cena\") and [Triple\nH](/wiki/Triple_H \"Triple H\") was scheduled on March 26.[25]\n\n[The Undertaker](/wiki/The_Undertaker \"The Undertaker\"), was originally\nscheduled to face [Rusev](/wiki/Rusev_\\(wrestler\\) \"Rusev \\(wrestler\\)\") in a\n[casket match](/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types#Casket_match\n\"Professional wrestling match types\"), the first match of its kind in three\nyears.[30] Due to reasons not entirely clear, Rusev was temporarily replaced\nby [Chris Jericho](/wiki/Chris_Jericho \"Chris Jericho\")[31] — this was\nexplained with Rusev's wife [Lana](/wiki/Lana_\\(wrestling\\) \"Lana\n\\(wrestling\\)\") complaining about her husband competing in a casket match[32]\n— but eventually reinserted back into the match. Jericho was restored to his\noriginal participation in the Greatest Royal Rumble match.[33]\n\nAt WrestleMania 34, [Jinder Mahal](/wiki/Jinder_Mahal \"Jinder Mahal\") defeated\n[Randy Orton](/wiki/Randy_Orton \"Randy Orton\"), [Bobby\nRoode](/wiki/Bobby_Roode \"Bobby Roode\"), and Rusev in a fatal-four way match\nto win the United States Championship.[26] Mahal was then traded to Raw and\nlost the championship to [Jeff Hardy](/wiki/Jeff_Hardy \"Jeff Hardy\") and Mahal\ninvoked his rematch clause for the Greatest Royal Rumble.[27] Hardy was then\ntraded to SmackDown the following night.[28]\n\nAt WrestleMania 34, [AJ Styles](/wiki/A.J._Styles \"A.J. Styles\") successfully\ndefended the WWE Championship against [Shinsuke\nNakamura](/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura \"Shinsuke Nakamura\").

He was\nthen removed from the match and banned from competing on _205 Live_ until he\nmet the weight requirement.[36] The following week,\n[Kalisto](/wiki/Kalisto_\\(wrestler\\) \"Kalisto \\(wrestler\\)\") earned a\nCruiserweight Championship match at the Greatest Royal Rumble by winning a\ngauntlet match.[37]\n\n##\nEvent[[edit](/w/index.php?title=WWE_Greatest_Royal_Rumble&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Event\")]\n\n### Preliminary\nmatches[[edit](/w/index.php?title=WWE_Greatest_Royal_Rumble&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Preliminary matches\")]\n\n**Other on-screen personnel** Role: | Name:  \n---|---  \nEnglish commentators | [Michael Cole](/wiki/Michael_Cole_\\(wrestling\\) \"Michael Cole \\(wrestling\\)\")  \n[Corey Graves](/wiki/Corey_Graves \"Corey Graves\")  \n[Byron Saxton](/wiki/Byron_Saxton \"Byron Saxton\")  \nSpanish commentators | [Carlos Cabrera](/wiki/Carlos_Cabrera \"Carlos Cabrera\")  \n[Marcelo Rodríguez](/wiki/Marcelo_Rodr%C3%ADguez \"Marcelo Rodríguez\")  \nArabic commentators | Faisal Almughaisib  \nSultan Alharbi  \nJude Aldajani  \n[Ring announcer](/wiki/Ring_announcer \"Ring announcer\") | Greg Hamilton  \n[Referees](/wiki/Referee_\\(professional_wrestling\\) \"Referee \\(professional wrestling\\)\") | Danilo Anfibio  \n[Jason Ayers](/wiki/Jason_Ayers \"Jason Ayers\")  \n[John Cone](/wiki/John_Cone \"John Cone\")  \n[Dan Engler](/wiki/Dan_Engler \"Dan Engler\")  \nDarrick Moore  \nChad Patton  \n[Ryan Tran](/wiki/Ryan_Tran \"Ryan Tran\")  \nInterviewer | Mike Rome  \nPre-show panel | Byron Saxton  \n[Jerry Lawler](/wiki/Jerry_Lawler \"Jerry Lawler\")  \n[Jim Ross](/wiki/Jim_Ross \"Jim Ross\")  \n[Booker T](/wiki/Booker_T_\\(wrestler\\) \"Booker T \\(wrestler\\)\")  \n  \nThe actual pay-per-view opened with John Cena facing Triple H.

Despite Reigns touching the floor with both feet\nfirst, the referee awarded the win to Lesnar, thereby retaining the Universal\nChampionship.[38]\n\n### Main\nevent[[edit](/w/index.php?title=WWE_Greatest_Royal_Rumble&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Main event\")]\n\n[Daniel Bryan](/wiki/Daniel_Bryan \"Daniel Bryan\") and [Dolph\nZiggler](/wiki/Dolph_Ziggler \"Dolph Ziggler\") began the 50-man Royal Rumble\nmatch as the first two entrants.
