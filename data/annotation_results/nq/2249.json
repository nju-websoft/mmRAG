This plan was\ninitiated at the end of the 19th century, during the time of Western colonial\nrule, largely under the vision of [Cecil Rhodes](/wiki/Cecil_Rhodes \"Cecil\nRhodes\"), in the attempt to connect adjacent African possessions of the\n[British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\") through a continuous\nline from [Cape Town](/wiki/Cape_Town \"Cape Town\"), [South\nAfrica](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\") to [Cairo](/wiki/Cairo \"Cairo\"),\n[Egypt](/wiki/Egypt \"Egypt\"). While most sections of the Cape to Cairo railway\nare in operation, a major part is missing between northern [Sudan](/wiki/Sudan\n\"Sudan\") and [Uganda](/wiki/Uganda \"Uganda\").[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Construction\n  * 2 Missed completion\n  * 3 Current links\n    * 3.1 Northern section\n    * 3.2 Uganda railway\n    * 3.3 TAZARA link\n    * 3.4 Kidatu connection\n    * 3.5 Southern section\n  * 4 Road\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 Sources\n  * 8 External links\n\n##\nConstruction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Construction\")]\n\nImperialist and entrepreneur [Cecil Rhodes](/wiki/Cecil_Rhodes \"Cecil Rhodes\")\nwas instrumental in securing the southern states of the continent for the\n[British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\") and envisioned a\ncontinuous \"red line\" of British dominions from north to south. A railway\nwould be a critical element in this scheme to unify the possessions,\nfacilitate governance, enable the military to move quickly to hot spots or\nconduct war, help settlement and enable intra- and extra-continental goods\ntrade. The construction of this project presented a major technological\nchallenge.\n\nFrance had a somewhat rival strategy in the late 1890s to link its western and\neastern African colonies, namely [Senegal](/wiki/Senegal \"Senegal\") to\n[Djibouti](/wiki/Djibouti \"Djibouti\"). [Southern Sudan](/wiki/Southern_Sudan\n\"Southern Sudan\") and [Ethiopia](/wiki/Ethiopia \"Ethiopia\") were in the way,\nbut France sent expeditions in 1897 to establish a protectorate in southern\nSudan and to find a route across Ethiopia. The scheme foundered when a British\nflotilla on the [River Nile](/wiki/River_Nile \"River Nile\") confronted the\nFrench expedition at the point of intersection between the French and British\nroutes, leading to the [Fashoda Incident](/wiki/Fashoda_Incident \"Fashoda\nIncident\") and eventual French retreat.\n\nThe [Portuguese](/wiki/Portugal \"Portugal\") considered an Angola to Mozambique\nrailway to link west with east and produced the \"[Pink Map](/wiki/Pink_Map\n\"Pink Map\")\" representing their claims to sovereignty in Africa (to link\n[Angola](/wiki/Portuguese_Angola \"Portuguese Angola\") and\n[Mozambique](/wiki/Portuguese_Mozambique \"Portuguese Mozambique\")).\n\nOpposition to British rule in South Africa was settled after the\n[First](/wiki/First_Boer_War \"First Boer War\") and\n[Second](/wiki/Second_Boer_War \"Second Boer War\") Boer Wars (ended 1902 but\nonly incorporating its two states into a union Republic in 1910).\n\n## Missed\ncompletion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Missed completion\")]\n\nBritish interests had to overcome obstacles of geography and climate, and the\ncompeting imperial schemes of the French and Portuguese mentioned above and of\nthe Germans. In 1891, Germany secured the strategically critical territory of\n[German East Africa](/wiki/German_East_Africa \"German East Africa\"), which\nalong with the mountainous rainforest of the [Belgian\nCongo](/wiki/Belgian_Congo \"Belgian Congo\") precluded the building of a Cape-\nto-Cairo railway.\n\nIn 1916 during [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\") British and\nBritish Indian soldiers won the [Tanganyika\nTerritory](/wiki/Tanganyika_Territory \"Tanganyika Territory\") from the Germans\nand after the war the British continued to rule the territory, which was a\n[League of Nations mandate](/wiki/League_of_Nations_mandate \"League of Nations\nmandate\") from 1922. The continuous line of colonies was complete. The\n[British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\") possessed the\npolitical power to complete the Cape to Cairo Railway, but economics,\nincluding the [Great Depression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\") of\nthe 1930s, prevented its completion before [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II\n\"World War II\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] After World War II, the [decolonisation of\nAfrica](/wiki/Decolonisation_of_Africa \"Decolonisation of Africa\") and the\nestablishment of independent countries removed the colonial rationale for the\nproject and increased the project's difficulty, effectively ending the\nproject.\n\n## Current\nlinks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Current links\")]\n\n### Northern\nsection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Northern section\")]\n\nEgypt has a rail system that as early as 1854 connected\n[Alexandria](/wiki/Alexandria \"Alexandria\") and [Cairo](/wiki/Cairo \"Cairo\"),\nand that currently goes as far south as [Aswan](/wiki/Aswan \"Aswan\"). In Egypt\nthe railway is [1,435 mm](/wiki/Standard_gauge \"Standard gauge\") (4 ft 8 1⁄2\nin) standard gauge. After a [ferry](/wiki/Train_ferry \"Train ferry\") link up\non the [Nile](/wiki/Nile \"Nile\"), the railway continues in [Sudan](/wiki/Sudan\n\"Sudan\") from [Wadi Halfa](/wiki/Wadi_Halfa \"Wadi Halfa\") to\n[Khartoum](/wiki/Khartoum \"Khartoum\") at the 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) [narrow\ngauge](/wiki/Narrow_gauge \"Narrow gauge\"); see [Northern Africa Railroad\nDevelopment](/wiki/Northern_Africa_Railroad_Development \"Northern Africa\nRailroad Development\"). This part of the system was started by [Lord\nKitchener](/wiki/Horatio_Kitchener,_1st_Earl_Kitchener \"Horatio Kitchener, 1st\nEarl Kitchener\") in 1897 when he subjugated the [Mahdist](/wiki/Muhammad_Ahmad\n\"Muhammad Ahmad\") uprising. Further railway links go south, the most southern\npoint being [Wau](/wiki/Wau,_Sudan \"Wau, Sudan\"). A large part of the Sudanese\nrailway network is currently in disrepair due to political turmoil.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Uganda\nrailway[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Uganda railway\")]\n\nMain article: [Uganda Railway](/wiki/Uganda_Railway \"Uganda Railway\")\n\nEast Africa has a network of narrow gauge 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) railways\nthat historically grew from ports on the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean\n\"Indian Ocean\") and went westward, built in parallel under British and German\ncolonial rule. The furthest string north was the [Uganda\nRailway](/wiki/Uganda_Railway \"Uganda Railway\"). Eventually these networks\nwere linked, so that today there is a continuous rail connection between\n[Kampala](/wiki/Kampala \"Kampala\"), [Uganda](/wiki/Uganda \"Uganda\"), on [Lake\nVictoria](/wiki/Lake_Victoria \"Lake Victoria\") to the coastal cities of\n[Mombasa](/wiki/Mombasa \"Mombasa\") in [Kenya](/wiki/Kenya \"Kenya\") and [Dar es\nSalaam](/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam \"Dar es Salaam\") in [Tanzania](/wiki/Tanzania\n\"Tanzania\"). Up to the break-up of the [East African\nCommunity](/wiki/East_African_Community \"East African Community\") in 1977,\nthese companies operated as [East African\nRailways](/wiki/East_African_Railways_and_Harbours_Corporation \"East African\nRailways and Harbours Corporation\"), but operate today as different national\ncompanies: the [Uganda Railways Corporation](/wiki/Uganda_Railways_Corporation\n\"Uganda Railways Corporation\") Uganda railways corporation's assets were sold\nover 13 years ago when government failed to run the corporation, as the cost\nof running it was greater than the returns. Today, railway business in Uganda\nis run by Rift Valley Railways of Kenya, the [Kenya Railways\nCorporation](/wiki/Kenya_Railways_Corporation \"Kenya Railways Corporation\"),\nand the [Tanzania Railways Corporation](/wiki/Tanzania_Railways_Corporation\n\"Tanzania Railways Corporation\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### TAZARA\nlink[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: TAZARA link\")]\n\nMain article: [TAZARA Railway](/wiki/TAZARA_Railway \"TAZARA Railway\")\n\nFrom Dar es Salaam, a 1,860 km link to [Kapiri Mposhi](/wiki/Kapiri_Mposhi\n\"Kapiri Mposhi\") in [Zambia](/wiki/Zambia \"Zambia\") was completed after six\nyears by workers and with main funding by China in 1976. This Tanzania-Zambia-\nRailway (TAZARA) was built to connect landlocked Zambia and its mineral wealth\nto a port on the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian Ocean\"),\nindependent from port connections in South Africa, a frequent rival economic\ncompetitor in the mining sectors or Mozambique, at that time Portuguese-\ncontrolled territory. Not intended in the grand picture of the Cape to Cairo\nRailway, the TAZARA fills a critical link. This connection is the 1,067 mm (3\nft 6 in) gauge of the [southern part of Africa](/wiki/Southern_Africa\n\"Southern Africa\").\n\n### Kidatu\nconnection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Kidatu connection\")]\n\nIn 1998, a transshipment hub was built at [Kidatu](/wiki/Kidatu \"Kidatu\") in\nsouthern [Tanzania](/wiki/Tanzania \"Tanzania\") to connect the [metre\ngauge](/wiki/Metre_gauge \"Metre gauge\") [Central Line\n(Tanzania)](/wiki/Central_Line_\\(Tanzania\\) \"Central Line \\(Tanzania\\)\") with\nthe [Cape gauge](/wiki/Cape_gauge \"Cape gauge\") [TAZARA](/wiki/TAZARA\n\"TAZARA\") line. This also shortened the distance.\n\n### Southern\nsection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Southern section\")]\n\nThe southern section was completed during British rule before the First World\nWar and has an interconnecting system of national railways using the Cape-\ngauge of 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in). Construction started from [Cape\nTown](/wiki/Cape_Town \"Cape Town\") and went parallel to the [Great North\nRoad](/wiki/Great_North_Road_\\(Africa\\) \"Great North Road \\(Africa\\)\") to\n[Kimberley](/wiki/Kimberley,_South_Africa \"Kimberley, South Africa\"), through\na part of [Botswana](/wiki/Botswana \"Botswana\") to [Bulawayo](/wiki/Bulawayo\n\"Bulawayo\"). From this junction the link proceeds further north, today\noperated by the [National Railways of\nZimbabwe](/wiki/National_Railways_of_Zimbabwe \"National Railways of\nZimbabwe\"), to the [Zambezi](/wiki/Zambezi \"Zambezi\") crossing. The [Victoria\nFalls Bridge](/wiki/Victoria_Falls_Bridge \"Victoria Falls Bridge\") was\ncompleted in 1905. The connection is picked up by [Zambia\nRailways](/wiki/Zambia_Railways \"Zambia Railways\") and continues to [Kapiri\nMposhi](/wiki/Kapiri_Mposhi \"Kapiri Mposhi\") which is the transition point to\nthe TAZARA link to Tanzania.\n\n## Road[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Road\")]\n\nThe [Court Treatt expedition](/wiki/Court_Treatt_expedition \"Court Treatt\nexpedition\"), an attempt to travel from Cape to Cairo by road, was made in\n1924 using two cars.[2]\n\nThe [Cape to Cairo Road](/wiki/Cape_to_Cairo_Road \"Cape to Cairo Road\") was\nplanned to roughly connect the same countries. That plan was updated with the\nCairo–Cape Town Highway plan, large sections of which are paved and passable.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/Africa_satellite_orthographic.jpg/25px-Africa_satellite_orthographic.jpg)[Africa portal](/wiki/Portal:Africa \"Portal:Africa\")\n\n  * [Cape to Cairo (disambiguation)](/wiki/Cape_to_Cairo_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Cape to Cairo \\(disambiguation\\)\")\n    * [Cape to Cairo Red Line](/wiki/Cape_to_Cairo_Red_Line \"Cape to Cairo Red Line\")\n    * [Cairo – Cape Town Highway](/wiki/Cairo_%E2%80%93_Cape_Town_Highway \"Cairo – Cape Town Highway\")\n  * [Northern Africa Railroad Development](/wiki/Northern_Africa_Railroad_Development \"Northern Africa Railroad Development\")\n  * [Scramble for Africa](/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa \"Scramble for Africa\")\n  * [Fashoda Incident](/wiki/Fashoda_Incident \"Fashoda Incident\")\n  * [East African Railway Master Plan](/wiki/East_African_Railway_Master_Plan \"East African Railway Master Plan\")\n  * [Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor](/wiki/Lamu_Port_and_Lamu-Southern_Sudan-Ethiopia_Transport_Corridor \"Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor\") – 2012\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_to_Cairo_Railway&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** MALLINSON, HARRIET (<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3843096/Doors-flying-open-70mph-trains-no-timetable-Chris-Tarrant-reveals-inside-track-hair-raising-Extreme-Railway-Journeys-TV-series.html>).
