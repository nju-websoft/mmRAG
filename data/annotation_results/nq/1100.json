It is acknowledged internationally in many other cultures.\nThe multi-day holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for\nand remember friends and family members who have died, and help support their\nspiritual journey. In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the [Representative\nList of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of\nHumanity](/wiki/Representative_List_of_the_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_of_Humanity\n\"Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\") by\n[UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO \"UNESCO\").[1]\n\nThe holiday is sometimes called _Día de los Muertos_[2][3] in\n[Anglophone](/wiki/English-speaking_world \"English-speaking world\") countries,\na [back-translation](/wiki/Translation#Back-translation \"Translation\") of its\noriginal name, _Día de Muertos_. It is particularly celebrated in Mexico where\nthe day is a [public holiday](/wiki/Public_holiday \"Public holiday\"). Prior to\nSpanish colonization in the 16th century, the celebration took place at the\nbeginning of summer. Gradually, it was associated with October 31, November 1,\nand November 2 to coincide with the Western Christianity\n[triduum](/wiki/Triduum \"Triduum\") of [Allhallowtide](/wiki/Allhallowtide\n\"Allhallowtide\"): [All Saints' Eve](/wiki/All_Saints%27_Eve \"All Saints'\nEve\"), [All Saints' Day](/wiki/All_Saints%27_Day \"All Saints' Day\"), and [All\nSouls' Day](/wiki/All_Souls%27_Day \"All Souls' Day\").[4][5] Traditions\nconnected with the holiday include building private altars called\n_[ofrendas](/wiki/Ofrenda \"Ofrenda\")_ , honoring the deceased using\n[calaveras](/wiki/Calavera \"Calavera\"), [aztec marigolds](/wiki/Tagetes_erecta\n\"Tagetes erecta\"), and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and\nvisiting graves with these as gifts.[6] Visitors also leave possessions of the\ndeceased at the graves.\n\nScholars trace the origins of the modern Mexican holiday to indigenous\nobservances dating back hundreds of years and to an [Aztec](/wiki/Aztec\n\"Aztec\") [festival](/wiki/Festival \"Festival\") dedicated to the\n[goddess](/wiki/Goddess \"Goddess\") [Mictecacihuatl](/wiki/Mictecacihuatl\n\"Mictecacihuatl\"). The holiday has spread throughout the world, being absorbed\ninto other deep traditions in honor of the dead. It has become a national\nsymbol and as such is taught (for educational purposes) in the nation's\nschools. Many families celebrate a traditional \"[All Saints'\nDay](/wiki/All_Saints%27_Day \"All Saints' Day\")\" associated with the Catholic\nChurch.\n\nOriginally, the Day of the Dead as such was not celebrated in northern Mexico,\nwhere it was unknown until the 20th century because its indigenous people had\ndifferent traditions. The people and the church rejected it as a day related\nto [syncretizing](/wiki/Syncretism \"Syncretism\") pagan elements with Catholic\nChristianity. They held the traditional '[All Saints'\nDay](/wiki/All_Saints%27_Day \"All Saints' Day\")' in the same way as other\nChristians in the world. There was limited [Mesoamerican](/wiki/Mesoamerican\n\"Mesoamerican\") influence in this region, and relatively few indigenous\ninhabitants from the regions of Southern Mexico, where the holiday was\ncelebrated. In the early 21st century in northern Mexico, Día de Muertos is\nobserved because the Mexican government made it a national holiday based on\neducational policies from the 1960s; it has introduced this holiday as a\nunifying national tradition based on indigenous traditions.[7][8][9]\n\nThe Mexican Day of the Dead celebration is similar to other societies'\nobservances of a time to honor the dead. The Spanish tradition, for instance,\nincludes festivals and parades, as well as gatherings of families at\ncemeteries to pray for their deceased loved ones at the end of the day.[10]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Observance in Mexico\n    * 1.1 Origins\n    * 1.2 Beliefs\n    * 1.3 Food\n  * 2 Observances outside Mexico\n    * 2.1 Americas\n      * 2.1.1 Belize\n      * 2.1.2 Bolivia\n      * 2.1.3 Brazil\n      * 2.1.4 Guatemala\n      * 2.1.5 Ecuador\n      * 2.1.6 Peru\n      * 2.1.7 United States\n        * 2.1.7.1 California\n    * 2.2 Asia\n      * 2.2.1 Goa, India\n      * 2.2.2 The Philippines\n    * 2.3 Europe\n    * 2.4 Oceania\n  * 3 Similar traditions\n  * 4 In popular culture\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n    * 6.1 Notes\n  * 7 Further reading\n\n## Observance in Mexico\n\n### Origins\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Mixquic_M%C3%A1gico_17.jpg/220px-\nMixquic_M%C3%A1gico_17.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mixquic_M%C3%A1gico_17.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mixquic_M%C3%A1gico_17.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWoman lighting [copal](/wiki/Copal \"Copal\") incense at the cemetery during the\n\"Alumbrada\" vigil in [San Andrés Mixquic](/wiki/San_Andr%C3%A9s_Mixquic \"San\nAndrés Mixquic\")\n\nThe Day of the Dead celebrations in [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\") developed\nfrom ancient traditions among its pre-Columbian cultures. Rituals celebrating\nthe deaths of [ancestors](/wiki/Ancestor_worship \"Ancestor worship\") had been\nobserved by these civilizations perhaps for as long as 2,500–3,000 years.[11]\nThe festival that developed into the modern Day of the Dead fell in the ninth\nmonth of the [Aztec calendar](/wiki/Aztec_calendar \"Aztec calendar\"), about\nthe beginning of August, and was celebrated for an entire month. The\nfestivities were dedicated to the goddess[12] known as the \"Lady of the Dead\",\ncorresponding to the modern [La Calavera Catrina](/wiki/La_Calavera_Catrina\n\"La Calavera Catrina\").\n\nBy the late 20th century in most regions of Mexico, practices had developed to\nhonor dead children and infants on November 1, and to honor deceased adults on\nNovember 2. November 1 is generally referred to as _Día de los Inocentes_\n(\"Day of the Innocents\") but also as _Día de los Angelitos_ (\"Day of the\nLittle Angels\"); November 2 is referred to as _Día de los Muertos_ or _Día de\nlos Difuntos_ (\"Day of the Dead\").[13]\n\n### Beliefs\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

November 1 is All Saints Day, and the adult spirits will come to visit. November 2 is All Souls Day, when families go to the cemetery to decorate the graves and tombs of their relatives. The three-day fiesta is filled with marigolds, the flowers of the dead; _muertos_ (the bread of the dead); sugar skulls; cardboard skeletons; tissue paper decorations; fruit and nuts; incense, and other traditional foods and decorations. | ”  \n---|---|---  \n— Frances Ann Day, _Latina and Latino Voices in Literature_[4]  \n  \nPeople go to cemeteries to be with the souls of the departed and build private\naltars containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and\nmemorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls,\nso the souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the living directed to\nthem. Celebrations can take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny\nevents and anecdotes about the departed.[13]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Cempasuchil.jpg/165px-\nCempasuchil.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cempasuchil.jpg)\n\nMexican [cempasúchil](/wiki/Tagetes_erecta \"Tagetes erecta\") (marigold) is the\ntraditional flower used to honor the dead\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Catrina_3.jpg/165px-\nCatrina_3.jpg)](/wiki/File:Catrina_3.jpg)\n\nCempasúchil, [alfeñiques](/wiki/Alfe%C3%B1ique \"Alfeñique\") and [papel\npicado](/wiki/Papel_picado \"Papel picado\") used to decorate an altar\n\nPlans for the day are made throughout the year, including gathering the goods\nto be offered to the dead. During the three-day period families usually clean\nand decorate graves;[12] most visit the cemeteries where their loved ones are\nburied and decorate their graves with\n_[ofrendas](/wiki/Ofrenda_\\(ritual_offering\\) \"Ofrenda \\(ritual offering\\)\")_\n(altars), which often include orange Mexican marigolds (_[Tagetes\nerecta](/wiki/Tagetes_erecta \"Tagetes erecta\")_) called _cempasúchil_\n(originally named _cempoaxochitl_ , [Nāhuatl](/wiki/Nahuatl_language \"Nahuatl\nlanguage\") for \"twenty flowers\"). In modern Mexico the marigold is sometimes\ncalled _Flor de Muerto_ (Flower of Dead). These flowers are thought to attract\n[souls](/wiki/Soul_\\(spirit\\) \"Soul \\(spirit\\)\") of the dead to the offerings.\n\nToys are brought for dead children (_los angelitos_ , or \"the little angels\"),\nand bottles of _[tequila](/wiki/Tequila \"Tequila\"), [mezcal](/wiki/Mezcal\n\"Mezcal\")_ or _[pulque](/wiki/Pulque \"Pulque\")_ or jars of\n_[atole](/wiki/Atole \"Atole\")_ for adults. Families will also offer trinkets\nor the deceased's favorite candies on the grave. Some families have _ofrendas_\nin homes, usually with foods such as candied pumpkin, _[pan de\nmuerto](/wiki/Pan_de_muerto \"Pan de muerto\")_ (\"bread of dead\"), and [sugar\nskulls](/wiki/Sugar_skull \"Sugar skull\"); and beverages such as _atole_. The\n_ofrendas_ are left out in the homes as a welcoming gesture for the\ndeceased.[12] Some people believe the spirits of the dead eat the \"spiritual\nessence\" of the _ofrendas_ food, so though the celebrators eat the food after\nthe festivities, they believe it lacks nutritional value. Pillows and blankets\nare left out so the deceased can rest after their long journey. In some parts\nof Mexico, such as the towns of [Mixquic](/wiki/San_Andr%C3%A9s_Mixquic \"San\nAndrés Mixquic\"), [Pátzcuaro](/wiki/P%C3%A1tzcuaro \"Pátzcuaro\") and\n[Janitzio](/wiki/Janitzio \"Janitzio\"), people spend all night beside the\ngraves of their relatives. In many places, people have picnics at the grave\nsite, as well.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/CemetarioAlmoloyaRio1995.jpg/220px-\nCemetarioAlmoloyaRio1995.jpg)](/wiki/File:CemetarioAlmoloyaRio1995.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:CemetarioAlmoloyaRio1995.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFamilies tidying and decorating graves at a cemetery in [Almoloya del\nRío](/wiki/Almoloya_del_R%C3%ADo \"Almoloya del Río\") in the [State of\nMexico](/wiki/State_of_Mexico \"State of Mexico\"), 1995\n\nSome families build [altars](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\") or small\n[shrines](/wiki/Shrine \"Shrine\") in their homes;[12] these sometimes feature a\n[Christian cross](/wiki/Christian_cross \"Christian cross\"), statues or\npictures of the [Blessed Virgin Mary](/wiki/Blessed_Virgin_Mary \"Blessed\nVirgin Mary\"), pictures of deceased relatives and other people, scores of\ncandles, and an _ofrenda_. Traditionally, families spend some time around the\naltar, praying and telling anecdotes about the deceased. In some locations,\ncelebrants wear shells on their clothing, so when they dance, the noise will\nwake up the dead; some will also dress up as the deceased.\n\nPublic schools at all levels build altars with _ofrendas_ , usually omitting\nthe religious symbols. Government offices usually have at least a small altar,\nas this holiday is seen as important to the Mexican heritage.\n\nThose with a distinctive talent for writing sometimes create short poems,\ncalled _calaveras_ (skulls), mocking [epitaphs](/wiki/Epitaph \"Epitaph\") of\nfriends, describing interesting habits and attitudes or funny anecdotes. This\ncustom originated in the 18th or 19th century after a newspaper published a\npoem narrating a dream of a cemetery in the future, \"and all of us were dead\",\nproceeding to read the tombstones. [Newspapers](/wiki/Newspaper \"Newspaper\")\ndedicate _calaveras_ to public figures, with [cartoons](/wiki/Cartoon\n\"Cartoon\") of [skeletons](/wiki/Skeleton \"Skeleton\") in the style of the\nfamous _[calaveras](/wiki/Calavera \"Calavera\")_ of [José Guadalupe\nPosada](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada \"José Guadalupe Posada\"), a Mexican\nillustrator.

Posada's striking\nimage of a costumed female with a skeleton face has become associated with the\nDay of the Dead, and Catrina figures often are a prominent part of modern Day\nof the Dead observances.\n\nA common [symbol](/wiki/Symbol \"Symbol\") of the holiday is the skull (in\nSpanish _[calavera](/wiki/Calavera \"Calavera\")_), which celebrants represent\nin [masks](/wiki/Mask \"Mask\"), called _[calacas](/wiki/Calaca \"Calaca\")_\n(colloquial term for skeleton), and foods such as sugar or chocolate skulls,\nwhich are inscribed with the name of the recipient on the forehead. Sugar\nskulls can be given as gifts to both the living and the dead. Other holiday\nfoods include _pan de muerto_ , a sweet [egg](/wiki/Egg_\\(food\\) \"Egg\n\\(food\\)\") bread made in various shapes from plain rounds to skulls and\n[rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit \"Rabbit\"), often decorated with white frosting to look\nlike twisted bones.\n\nThe traditions and activities that take place in celebration of the Day of the\nDead are not universal, often varying from town to town. For example, in the\ntown of [Pátzcuaro](/wiki/P%C3%A1tzcuaro \"Pátzcuaro\") on the [Lago de\nPátzcuaro](/wiki/Lago_de_P%C3%A1tzcuaro \"Lago de Pátzcuaro\") in\n[Michoacán](/wiki/Michoac%C3%A1n \"Michoacán\"), the tradition is very different\nif the deceased is a child rather than an adult. On November 1 of the year\nafter a child's death, the [godparents](/wiki/Godparents \"Godparents\") set a\ntable in the parents' home with sweets, fruits, _pan de muerto_ , a cross, a\nrosary (used to ask the Virgin Mary to pray for them) and candles. This is\nmeant to celebrate the child's life, in respect and appreciation for the\nparents. There is also dancing with colorful costumes, often with skull-shaped\nmasks and devil masks in the plaza or garden of the town. At midnight on\nNovember 2, the people light candles and ride winged boats called _mariposas_\n(butterflies) to Janitzio, an island in the middle of the lake where there is\na cemetery, to honor and celebrate the lives of the dead there.\n\nIn contrast, the town of [Ocotepec](/wiki/Ocotepec,_Cuernavaca,_Morelos\n\"Ocotepec, Cuernavaca, Morelos\"), north of [Cuernavaca](/wiki/Cuernavaca\n\"Cuernavaca\") in the State of [Morelos](/wiki/Morelos \"Morelos\"), opens its\ndoors to visitors in exchange for _veladoras_ (small wax candles) to show\nrespect for the recently deceased. In return the visitors receive\n[tamales](/wiki/Tamales \"Tamales\") and _atole_. This is done only by the\nowners of the house where someone in the household has died in the previous\nyear. Many people of the surrounding areas arrive early to eat for free and\nenjoy the elaborate altars set up to receive the visitors.\n\nIn some parts of the country (especially the cities, where in recent years\nother customs have been displaced) children in costumes roam the streets,\nknocking on people's doors for a _calaverita_ , a small gift of candies or\nmoney; they also ask passersby for it. This relatively recent custom is\nsimilar to that of [Halloween's](/wiki/Halloween \"Halloween\") [trick-or-\ntreating](/wiki/Trick-or-treating \"Trick-or-treating\") in the United States.\n\nSome people believe possessing Day of the Dead items can bring good luck. Many\npeople get tattoos or have dolls of the dead to carry with them. They also\nclean their houses and prepare the favorite dishes of their deceased loved\nones to place upon their altar or _ofrenda_.\n\n### Food\n\nDuring Day of the Dead festivities, food is both eaten by living people and\ngiven to the spirits of their departed ancestors as _ofrendas_\n(\"offerings\").[14] [Tamales](/wiki/Tamales \"Tamales\") are one of the most\ncommon dishes prepared for this day for both purposes.[15]\n\n[Pan de muerto](/wiki/Pan_de_muerto \"Pan de muerto\") and\n[calaveras](/wiki/Calavera \"Calavera\") are associated specifically with Day of\nthe Dead. Pan de muerto is a type of sweet roll shaped like a bun, topped with\nsugar, and often decorated with bone-shaped phalanges pieces.[16] Calaveras,\nor sugar skulls, display colorful designs to represent the vitality and\nindividual personality of the departed.[15]\n\nIn addition to food, drink is also important to the tradition of Day of the\nDead. Historically, the main alcoholic drink was [pulque](/wiki/Pulque\n\"Pulque\") while today families will commonly drink the favorite beverage of\ntheir deceased ancestors.[15] Other drinks associated with the holiday are\n[atole](/wiki/Atole \"Atole\") and [champurrado](/wiki/Champurrado\n\"Champurrado\"), warm, thick, non-alcoholic [masa](/wiki/Masa \"Masa\") drinks.\n\nJamaican iced tea is a popular herbal tea made of the flowers and leaves of\nthe Jamaican hibiscus plant (_[Hibiscus sabdariffa](/wiki/Hibiscus_sabdariffa\n\"Hibiscus sabdariffa\")_), known as _flor de Jamaica_ in Mexico. It is served\ncold and quite sweet with a lot of ice. The ruby-red beverage is called\n[hibiscus tea](/wiki/Hibiscus_tea \"Hibiscus tea\") in English-speaking\ncountries and called _agua de Jamaica_ (water of [Jamaica](/wiki/Jamaica\n\"Jamaica\")) in Spanish.[17]\n\n## Observances outside Mexico\n\nSee also: [Festival of the Dead](/wiki/Festival_of_the_Dead \"Festival of the\nDead\")\n\n### Americas\n\n#### Belize\n\nIn [Belize](/wiki/Belize \"Belize\"), Day of the Dead is practiced by people of\nthe [Yucatec Maya](/wiki/Yucatec_Maya \"Yucatec Maya\") ethnicity. The\ncelebration is known as _Hanal Pixan_ which means \"food for the souls\" in\ntheir language. Altars are constructed and decorated with food, drinks,\ncandies, and candles put on them.\n\n#### Bolivia\n\n_Día de las Ñatitas_ (\"Day of the Skulls\") is a festival celebrated in [La\nPaz](/wiki/La_Paz \"La Paz\"), [Bolivia](/wiki/Bolivia \"Bolivia\"), on May 5. In\n[pre-Columbian](/wiki/Pre-Columbian \"Pre-Columbian\") times indigenous Andeans\nhad a tradition of sharing a day with the bones of their ancestors on the\nthird year after burial. Today families keep only the skulls for such rituals.\nTraditionally, the skulls of family members are kept at home to watch over the\nfamily and protect them during the year. On November 9, the family crowns the\nskulls with fresh flowers, sometimes also dressing them in various garments,\nand making offerings of cigarettes, coca leaves, alcohol, and various other\nitems in thanks for the year's protection. The skulls are also sometimes taken\nto the central cemetery in La Paz for a special Mass and blessing.[18][19][20]\n\n#### Brazil\n\nThe [Brazilian](/wiki/Brazil \"Brazil\") public holiday of _Finados_ (Day of the\nDead) is celebrated on November 2. Similar to other Day of the Dead\ncelebrations, people go to cemeteries and churches with flowers and candles\nand offer prayers. The celebration is intended as a positive honoring of the\ndead. Memorializing the dead draws from indigenous, African and European\nCatholic origins.\n\n#### Guatemala\n\n[Guatemalan](/wiki/Guatemala \"Guatemala\") celebrations of the Day of the Dead,\non November 1, are highlighted by the construction and flying of giant\nkites[21] in addition to the traditional visits to grave sites of ancestors. A\nbig event also is the consumption of _[fiambre](/wiki/Fiambre \"Fiambre\")_ ,\nwhich is made only for this day during the year.\n\n#### Ecuador\n\nIn [Ecuador](/wiki/Ecuador \"Ecuador\") the Day of the Dead is observed to some\nextent by all parts of society, though it is especially important to the\nindigenous [Kichwa](/wiki/Kichwa \"Kichwa\") peoples, who make up an estimated\nquarter of the population. _Indigena_ families gather together in the\ncommunity cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their\nancestors and lost loved ones. Ceremonial foods include _[colada\nmorada](/wiki/Colada_morada \"Colada morada\")_ , a spiced fruit porridge that\nderives its deep purple color from the [Andean blackberry](/wiki/Rubus\n\"Rubus\") and purple maize. This is typically consumed with _[guagua de\npan](/wiki/Guagua_de_pan \"Guagua de pan\")_ , a bread shaped like a swaddled\ninfant, though variations include many pigs—the latter being traditional to\nthe city of [Loja](/wiki/Loja,_Ecuador \"Loja, Ecuador\"). The bread, which is\nwheat flour-based today, but was made with [masa](/wiki/Masa \"Masa\") in the\n[pre-Columbian](/wiki/Pre-Columbian \"Pre-Columbian\") era, can be made savory\nwith cheese inside or sweet with a filling of [guava paste](/wiki/Guava_paste\n\"Guava paste\"). These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well,\nwhere food establishments add both _colada morada_ and _gaugua de pan_ to\ntheir menus for the season. Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves\nof the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional\nfoods, too.[22]\n\n#### Peru\n\nUsually people visit the cemetery and bring flowers to decorate the graves of\ndead relatives. Sometimes people play music at the cemetery.[23]\n\n#### United States\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Flower_of_the_Dead_%C3%A1nima_%28memorial%29.jpg/220px-\nFlower_of_the_Dead_%C3%A1nima_%28memorial%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Flower_of_the_Dead_%C3%A1nima_\\(memorial\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Flower_of_the_Dead_%C3%A1nima_\\(memorial\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn _ánima_ for the dead\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Dia_de_los_Muertos_Celebration_in_Mission_District_of_San_Francisco%2C_CA.jpg/220px-\nDia_de_los_Muertos_Celebration_in_Mission_District_of_San_Francisco%2C_CA.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dia_de_los_Muertos_Celebration_in_Mission_District_of_San_Francisco,_CA.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dia_de_los_Muertos_Celebration_in_Mission_District_of_San_Francisco,_CA.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nWomen with calaveras makeup celebrating Dia de Muertos in the [Mission\nDistrict](/wiki/Mission_District \"Mission District\") of San Francisco,\nCalifornia\n\nIn many American communities with Mexican residents, Day of the Dead\ncelebrations are very similar to those held in Mexico.

The All Souls\nProcession has been an annual [Tucson, Arizona](/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona \"Tucson,\nArizona\") event since 1990. The event combines elements of traditional Day of\nthe Dead celebrations with those of pagan harvest festivals. People wearing\nmasks carry signs honoring the dead and an urn in which people can place slips\nof paper with prayers on them to be burned.[27] Likewise, Old Town San Diego,\nCalifornia annually hosts a traditional two-day celebration culminating in a\ncandlelight procession to the historic El Campo Santo Cemetery.[28]\n\nIn [Missoula, Montana](/wiki/Missoula,_Montana \"Missoula, Montana\"),\ncelebrants wearing skeleton costumes and walking on stilts, riding novelty\nbicycles, and traveling on skis parade through town.[29]\n\nThe festival also is held annually at historic Forest Hills Cemetery in\nBoston's [Jamaica Plain](/wiki/Jamaica_Plain \"Jamaica Plain\") neighborhood.\nSponsored by Forest Hills Educational Trust and the folkloric performance\ngroup La Piñata, the Day of the Dead festivities celebrate the cycle of life\nand death. People bring offerings of flowers, photos, mementos, and food for\ntheir departed loved ones, which they place at an elaborately and colorfully\ndecorated altar. A program of traditional music and dance also accompanies the\ncommunity event.\n\nThe [Smithsonian Institution](/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution \"Smithsonian\nInstitution\"), in collaboration with the [University of Texas at El\nPaso](/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_El_Paso \"University of Texas at El Paso\")\nand [Second Life](/wiki/Second_Life \"Second Life\"), have created a Smithsonian\nLatino Virtual Museum and accompanying multimedia e-book: _Día de los Muertos:\nDay of the Dead_. The project's website contains some of the text and images\nwhich explain the origins of some of the customary core practices related to\nthe Day of the Dead, such as the background beliefs and the _offrenda_ (the\nspecial altar commemorating one's deceased loved one).[30] The Made For\n[iTunes](/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\") multimedia e-book version provides additional\ncontent, such as further details; additional photo galleries; pop-up profiles\nof influential Latino artists and cultural figures over the decades; and video\nclips[31] of interviews with artists who make Dia de Muertos-themed artwork,\nexplanations and performances of Aztec and other traditional dances, an\nanimation short that explains the customs to children, virtual poetry readings\nin English and Spanish.[32][33]\n\n##### California\n\n[![A line of\nvendors](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Corazon_del_Pueblo_in_Fruitvale%2C_Oakland%2C_CA%2C_US%2C_2016.jpg/220px-\nCorazon_del_Pueblo_in_Fruitvale%2C_Oakland%2C_CA%2C_US%2C_2016.jpg)](/wiki/File:Corazon_del_Pueblo_in_Fruitvale,_Oakland,_CA,_US,_2016.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Corazon_del_Pueblo_in_Fruitvale,_Oakland,_CA,_US,_2016.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nCorazon del Pueblo in Fruitvale, Oakland, California, 2016\n\n[Santa Ana, California](/wiki/Santa_Ana,_California \"Santa Ana, California\")\nis said to hold the \"largest event in Southern California\" honoring Día de\nMuertos, called the annual Noche de Altares, which began in 2002.[34] The\ncelebration of the Day of the Dead in Santa Ana has grown to two large events\nwith the creation of an event held at the [Santa Ana Regional Transportation\nCenter](/wiki/Santa_Ana_Regional_Transportation_Center \"Santa Ana Regional\nTransportation Center\") for the first time on November 1, 2015.[35]\n\nIn other communities, interactions between Mexican traditions and American\nculture are resulting in celebrations in which Mexican traditions are being\nextended to make artistic or sometimes political statements. For example, in\n[Los Angeles, California](/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California \"Los Angeles,\nCalifornia\"), the [Self Help Graphics & Art](/wiki/Self_Help_Graphics_%26_Art\n\"Self Help Graphics & Art\") Mexican-American cultural center presents an\nannual Day of the Dead celebration that includes both traditional and\npolitical elements, such as altars to honor the victims of the [Iraq\nWar](/wiki/Iraq_War \"Iraq War\"), highlighting the high casualty rate among\nLatino soldiers. An updated, intercultural version of the Day of the Dead is\nalso evolving at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.[36] There, in a mixture of\n[Native Californian](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_California \"Indigenous\npeoples of California\") art, Mexican traditions and Hollywood hip,\nconventional altars are set up side-by-side with altars to [Jayne\nMansfield](/wiki/Jayne_Mansfield \"Jayne Mansfield\") and [Johnny\nRamone](/wiki/Johnny_Ramone \"Johnny Ramone\"). Colorful native dancers and\nmusic intermix with [performance artists](/wiki/Performance_art \"Performance\nart\"), while sly [pranksters](/wiki/Prank \"Prank\") play on traditional themes.\n\nSimilar traditional and intercultural updating of Mexican celebrations are\nheld in [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco,_California \"San Francisco,\nCalifornia\"). For example, the [Galería de la\nRaza](/wiki/Galer%C3%ADa_de_la_Raza \"Galería de la Raza\"), SomArts Cultural\nCenter, Mission Cultural Center, [de Young Museum](/wiki/De_Young_Museum \"De\nYoung Museum\") and altars at [Garfield Square](/wiki/Garfield_Square \"Garfield\nSquare\") by the Marigold Project.[37] Oakland is home to _Corazon Del Pueblo_\nin the Fruitvale district. _Corazon Del Pueblo_ has a shop offering\nhandcrafted Mexican gifts and a museum devoted to Day of the Dead artifacts.\nAlso, the Fruitvale district in Oakland serves as the hub of the _Dia de\nMuertos_ annual festival which occurs the last weekend of October. Here, a mix\nof several Mexican traditions come together with traditional Aztec dancers,\nregional Mexican music, and other Mexican artisans to celebrate the day.[38]\n\n### Asia\n\n#### Goa, India\n\nThe Catholic traditions were initiated with the arrival of the Portuguese in\n1510. The Almacho Dis (Souls Day) is commemorated on Nov 2, following all\nSaints Day (Nov. 1). On this day, the forgotten souls are remembered and\nspiritual charity is done though prayer for the deceased family and ancestral\nsouls. Charity is practiced also by offering food for the poor called beggars\nlunch (bikareanchem jevonn) where the poor are invited for lunch, from the\nvillage and treated with dignity and respect. The invited down trodden are\nserved as guest and usually commences with prayers for the deceased souls.\nFollowing mass on all souls day, the deceased visit the graveyard of the\ndeceased souls and pray and also decorate their graves.[39]\n\n#### The Philippines\n\nWhile ancestor veneration is an ancient part of [Filipino\nculture](/wiki/Culture_of_the_Philippines \"Culture of the Philippines\"), the\nmodern observance is believed to have been imported from Mexico when the\nislands (as part of the [Spanish East Indies](/wiki/Spanish_East_Indies\n\"Spanish East Indies\")) were governed from [Mexico City](/wiki/Mexico_City\n\"Mexico City\") as part of the [Viceroyalty of New Spain](/wiki/New_Spain \"New\nSpain\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] During the holiday (observed every November 1),\n[Filipinos](/wiki/Filipino_people \"Filipino people\") customarily visit family\ntombs and other graves, which they repair and clean. Entire families spend a\nnight or two at their loved ones' tombs, passing time with card games, eating,\ndrinking, singing and dancing. Prayers such as the [rosary](/wiki/Rosary\n\"Rosary\") are often said for the deceased, who are normally offered candles,\nflowers, food, and even liquor. Some Catholic [Chinese\nFilipino](/wiki/Chinese_Filipino \"Chinese Filipino\") families additionally\noffer [joss sticks](/wiki/Joss_sticks \"Joss sticks\") to the dead, and observe\ncustoms otherwise associated with the [Hungry Ghost\nFestival](/wiki/Hungry_Ghost_Festival \"Hungry Ghost Festival\").\n\n### Europe\n\nIn Christian Europe, Roman Catholic customs absorbed pagan traditions. [All\nSaints Day](/wiki/All_Saints_Day \"All Saints Day\") and [All Souls\nDay](/wiki/All_Souls_Day \"All Souls Day\") became the autumnal celebration of\nthe dead. Over many centuries, rites which had occurred in cultivated fields,\nwhere the souls of the dead were thought to leave after the harvest, to\ncemeteries.\n\nIn many countries with a Roman Catholic heritage, [All Saints\nDay](/wiki/All_Saints_Day \"All Saints Day\") and [All Souls\nDay](/wiki/All_Souls_Day \"All Souls Day\") have evolved traditions in which\npeople take the day off work, go to cemeteries with candles and flowers, and\ngive presents to children, usually sweets and toys.[10][40] In\n[Portugal](/wiki/Portugal \"Portugal\") and Spain _ofrendas_ (\"offerings\") are\nmade on this day. In Spain, the play _[Don Juan\nTenorio](/wiki/Don_Juan_Tenorio \"Don Juan Tenorio\")_ is traditionally\nperformed.[10] In [Belgium](/wiki/Belgium \"Belgium\"), [France](/wiki/France\n\"France\"), [Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\"), [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\"),\nthe [Netherlands](/wiki/Netherlands \"Netherlands\"), Portugal, and Spain,\npeople bring flowers (typically chrysanthemums in France and northern Europe)\nto the graves of dead relatives and say prayers over the dead.\n\nIn Eastern Europe holiday is called [Dziady](/wiki/Dziady \"Dziady\") and also\nhas pagan origins. In [Belarus](/wiki/Belarus \"Belarus\") the ancient tradition\ninvolved cooking ritual dishes for supper. Part of each dish was put into a\nseparate plate and left overnight for the dead ancestors. Public meetings are\noften organized on this day to commemorate the victims of [Soviet political\nrepressions](/wiki/Soviet_political_repressions \"Soviet political\nrepressions\").\n\nAs part of a promotion by the Mexican embassy in [Prague, Czech\nRepublic](/wiki/Prague,_Czech_Republic \"Prague, Czech Republic\"), since the\nlate 20th century, some local citizens join in a Mexican-style Day of the\nDead. A theatre group produces events featuring masks, candles, and sugar\nskulls.[41]\n\n### Oceania\n\nMexican-style Day of the Dead celebrations occur in major cities in\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"), [Fiji](/wiki/Fiji \"Fiji\"), and\n[Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia \"Indonesia\"). Additionally, prominent celebrations\nare held in [Wellington](/wiki/Wellington \"Wellington\"), New Zealand, complete\nwith altars celebrating the deceased with flowers and gifts.[42]\n\n## Similar traditions\n\nMany other cultures around the world have similar traditions of a day set\naside to visit the graves of deceased family members. Often included in these\ntraditions are celebrations, food, and beverages, in addition to prayers and\nremembrances of the departed.\n\nIn some [African](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\") cultures, visits to ancestors'\ngraves, the leaving of food and gifts, and the asking of protection from them\nserve as important parts of traditional rituals. One such ritual is held just\nbefore the start of the hunting season.[43]\n\nThe [Qingming Festival](/wiki/Qingming_Festival \"Qingming Festival\")\n([simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters \"Simplified Chinese\ncharacters\"): 清明节; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters\n\"Traditional Chinese characters\"): 清明節; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin \"Pinyin\"): _qīng\nmíng jié_) is a [traditional Chinese\nfestival](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_holidays \"Traditional Chinese holidays\")\nusually occurring around April 5 of the [Gregorian\ncalendar](/wiki/Gregorian_calendar \"Gregorian calendar\"). Along with [Double\nNinth Festival](/wiki/Double_Ninth_Festival \"Double Ninth Festival\") on the\n9th day of the 9th month in the [Chinese calendar](/wiki/Chinese_calendar\n\"Chinese calendar\"), it is a time to tend to the graves of departed ones. In\naddition, in the Chinese tradition, the seventh month in the Chinese calendar\nis called the [Ghost Month](/wiki/Ghost_Festival \"Ghost Festival\") (鬼月), in\nwhich ghosts and spirits come out from the underworld to visit earth.\n\nThe [Bon Festival](/wiki/Bon_Festival \"Bon Festival\") (O-bon (お盆), or only Bon\n(盆)), is a [Japanese](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\") [Buddhist](/wiki/Buddhism_in_Japan\n\"Buddhism in Japan\") holiday held in August to honor the spirits of departed\n[ancestors](/wiki/Ancestor \"Ancestor\"). It is derived in part from the Chinese\nobservance of the Ghost Month, and was affixed to the solar calendar along\nwith other traditional Japanese holidays.\n\nIn [Korea](/wiki/Korea \"Korea\"), _[Chuseok](/wiki/Chuseok \"Chuseok\")_ (추석, 秋夕;\nalso called _Hangawi_) is a major traditional holiday. People go where the\nspirits of their ancestors are enshrined, and perform [ancestral\nworship](/wiki/Ancestor_worship \"Ancestor worship\") rituals early in the\nmorning. They visit the tombs of immediate ancestors to trim plants, clean the\narea around the tomb, and offer food, drink, and crops to their ancestors.\n\nDuring the [Nepalese](/wiki/Nepal \"Nepal\") holiday of _[Gai\nJatra](/wiki/Gai_Jatra \"Gai Jatra\")_ (\"Cow Pilgrimage\"), every family who has\nlost a member during the previous year creates a _tai_ out of bamboo branches,\ncloth, and paper decorations, in which are placed portraits of the deceased.\nAs a cow traditionally [leads the spirits of the dead](/wiki/Psychopomp\n\"Psychopomp\") into the afterlife, an actual or symbolic cow is used depending\non local custom. The festival is also a time to dress up in a costume\nreminiscent of the western Halloween, with popular subjects including\npolitical commentary and satire.[44]\n\n## In popular culture\n\n[Disneyland Resorts](/wiki/Disneyland_Resort \"Disneyland Resort\")' annual\n\"[Halloween Time](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Halloween_Party \"Mickey's Halloween\nParty\")\" celebrates the art and traditions of Dias de los Muertos located at\n[Frontierland](/wiki/Frontierland \"Frontierland\").[45][46][47]\n\nThe 1998 _[Grim Fandango](/wiki/Grim_Fandango \"Grim Fandango\")_ video game\nfeatures Mexican Day of the Dead iconography with [Aztec](/wiki/Aztec \"Aztec\")\nand [Egyptian](/wiki/Egypt \"Egypt\") influences.[48]\n\nThe 2014 _[The Book of Life](/wiki/The_Book_of_Life_\\(2014_film\\) \"The Book of\nLife \\(2014 film\\)\")_ film follows a [bullfighter](/wiki/Torero \"Torero\") who,\non the Day of the Dead, embarks on an afterlife adventure.[49]\n\nIn the 2015 [James Bond](/wiki/James_Bond \"James Bond\") film,\n_[Spectre](/wiki/Spectre_\\(2015_film\\) \"Spectre \\(2015 film\\)\")_ , the opening\nsequence featured a Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City. At the time, no\nsuch parade took place in Mexico City; one year later, due to the interest in\nthe film and the government desire to promote the [pre-Hispanic](/wiki/Pre-\nColumbian_era \"Pre-Columbian era\") Mexican culture, the federal and local\nauthorities decided to organize an actual \"Día de Muertos\" parade through\n[Paseo de la Reforma](/wiki/Paseo_de_la_Reforma \"Paseo de la Reforma\") and\n[Centro Historico](/wiki/Historic_center_of_Mexico_City \"Historic center of\nMexico City\") on October 29, 2016, which was attended by 250,000\npeople.[50][51][52]\n\nThe 2016 _[Elena of Avalor](/wiki/Elena_of_Avalor \"Elena of Avalor\")_ season\none episode \"A Night to Remember\" focused on Dias de los Muertos.[53]\n\nThe 2017 [Pixar](/wiki/Pixar \"Pixar\") film _[Coco](/wiki/Coco_\\(2017_film\\)\n\"Coco \\(2017 film\\)\")_ features the Dias de los Muertos holiday as a major\nelement in its plot.[54]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Literary Calaverita](/wiki/Literary_Calaverita \"Literary Calaverita\")\n  * [Danse Macabre](/wiki/Danse_Macabre \"Danse Macabre\")\n  * [Samhain](/wiki/Samhain \"Samhain\")\n  * [Skull art](/wiki/Skull_art \"Skull art\")\n  * [Thursday of the Dead](/wiki/Thursday_of_the_Dead \"Thursday of the Dead\")\n  * [Veneration of the dead](/wiki/Veneration_of_the_dead \"Veneration of the dead\")\n  * [Walpurgis Night](/wiki/Walpurgis_Night \"Walpurgis Night\")\n\n## References\n\n### Notes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Indigenous festivity dedicated to the dead\"](http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00054).
