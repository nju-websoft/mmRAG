It deals with reminiscence upon youth and romantic idealism.\n\n[Mary Hopkin](/wiki/Mary_Hopkin \"Mary Hopkin\")'s 1968 version of the song,\nproduced by [Paul McCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\"), became a\nnumber one hit on the [UK Singles Chart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles\nChart\"). The song also reached number two on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\"), behind McCartney's own band\n[The Beatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The Beatles\")' hit \"[Hey Jude](/wiki/Hey_Jude\n\"Hey Jude\")\". In France the song was at no. 1 in the very first edition of the\nsingles sales chart launched by the Centre d'Information et de Documentation\ndu Disque in October 1968.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Early history\n  * 2 Later history\n  * 3 Recordings\n  * 4 Chart performance (Mary Hopkin version)\n    * 4.1 Weekly charts\n    * 4.2 Year-end charts\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Early\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Those_Were_the_Days_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Early history\")]\n\n[Georgian](/wiki/Georgians \"Georgians\") singer [Tamara\nTsereteli](/wiki/Tamara_Tsereteli \"Tamara Tsereteli\") (1900–1968) and\n[Russian](/wiki/Russians \"Russians\") singer [Alexander\nVertinsky](/wiki/Alexander_Vertinsky \"Alexander Vertinsky\") made what were\nprobably the earliest recordings of the song, in 1925[4] and in 1926[5]\nrespectively.\n\nThe song appears in the 1953 British/French movie _[Innocents in\nParis](/wiki/Innocents_in_Paris \"Innocents in Paris\")_ , in which it was sung\nwith its original Russian lyrics by the Russian [Tzigane](/wiki/Romani_music\n\"Romani music\") [chanteuse](/wiki/Chanteuse \"Chanteuse\") Ludmila Lopato. [Mary\nHopkin](/wiki/Mary_Hopkin \"Mary Hopkin\")'s 1968 recording of it with Gene\nRaskin's lyric was a chart-topping hit in much of the Northern Hemisphere. On\nmost recordings of the song, Raskin is credited as the sole writer, even\nthough he wrote only the later English lyrics (which are not an English\ntranslation of the Russian lyrics) and not the music.\n\n## Later\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Those_Were_the_Days_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Later history\")]\n\nIn the early 1960s Raskin, with his wife Francesca, played folk music around\n[Greenwich Village](/wiki/Greenwich_Village \"Greenwich Village\") in New York,\nincluding [White Horse Tavern](/wiki/White_Horse_Tavern_\\(New_York_City\\)\n\"White Horse Tavern \\(New York City\\)\"). Raskin, who had grown up hearing the\nsong, wrote with his wife [6] new English lyrics to the old [Russian\nmusic](/wiki/Music_of_Russia \"Music of Russia\") and then copyrighted both\nmusic and lyrics in his own name.[7] [The Limeliters](/wiki/The_Limeliters\n\"The Limeliters\") subsequently released a recording of the song on their 1962\nLP _Folk Matinee_.[8] The Raskins were international performers and had played\nLondon's \"Blue Angel\" every year, always closing their show with the song.\n[Paul McCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\") frequented the club\nand being quite taken with the song he attempted to get several singers or\ngroups (including the early [Moody Blues](/wiki/The_Moody_Blues \"The Moody\nBlues\")) to record it.[9] Failing at that, after the formation of [the\nBeatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The Beatles\")' own [Apple\nRecords](/wiki/Apple_Records \"Apple Records\") label, McCartney immediately\nrecorded Mary Hopkin performing the song. The song was eventually recorded in\nover twenty languages and by many different artists, including Gene and\nFrancesca, and Raskin was able to live very well on the royalties, buying a\nhome in Pollensa, [Mallorca](/wiki/Majorca \"Majorca\"), a [Porsche\nSpyder](/wiki/Porsche_550 \"Porsche 550\") and a sail boat.\n\nHopkin's recording was produced by [Paul McCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul\nMcCartney\") with an arrangement by [Richard\nHewson](/wiki/Richard_Anthony_Hewson \"Richard Anthony Hewson\") (per the label\nof the record) and became a number-one hit on the [UK Singles\nChart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\"). In the United States,\nHopkin's recording reached number two on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") (held out of the top spot\nfor three weeks by \"[Hey Jude](/wiki/Hey_Jude \"Hey Jude\")\" by [the\nBeatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The Beatles\")) and topped the Billboard [Easy\nListening](/wiki/Adult_Contemporary_\\(chart\\) \"Adult Contemporary \\(chart\\)\")\ncharts for six weeks.[10] In the Netherlands, it topped the charts for two\nconsecutive weeks.[11] The Russian origin of the melody was accentuated by an\ninstrumentation that was unusual for a top-ten pop record, including\n[balalaika](/wiki/Balalaika \"Balalaika\"), [clarinet](/wiki/Clarinet\n\"Clarinet\"), [hammered dulcimer](/wiki/Hammered_dulcimer \"Hammered dulcimer\"),\ntenor banjo and children's chorus, giving a [klezmer](/wiki/Klezmer \"Klezmer\")\nfeel to the song. Mary Hopkin played acoustic guitar on the recording, and\n[Paul McCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\") also played acoustic\nguitar and possibly percussion. The hammered dulcimer, or\n[cimbalom](/wiki/Cimbalom \"Cimbalom\"), was played by Gilbert Webster.[12] It\nis unknown who played the banjo though McCartney is known to be a banjoist.\n\nMcCartney also recorded Hopkin singing \"Those Were The Days\" in five other\nlanguages for release in their respective countries:\n\n  * In [Spain](/wiki/Spain \"Spain\"), _Qué tiempo tan feliz_ , by [Rosa Morena](/wiki/Rosa_Morena \"Rosa Morena\") (instead of _Aquellos Fueron Los Días_ or _En Aquellos Días_)\n  * In [West Germany](/wiki/West_Germany \"West Germany\"), _An jenem Tag_\n  * In [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\"), _Quelli erano giorni_\n  * In [France](/wiki/France \"France\"), _Le temps des fleurs_\n  * In [Afghanistan Farsi](/wiki/Dari_language \"Dari language\"), \"Deegar Ashkam Mariz\" by legendary singer [Ahmad Zahir](/wiki/Ahmad_Zahir \"Ahmad Zahir\") (1972).\n\nAll five non-English sets of lyrics were also recorded by\n[Dalida](/wiki/Dalida \"Dalida\") and [Sandie Shaw](/wiki/Sandie_Shaw \"Sandie\nShaw\"), with Shaw recording the English lyrics as well.\n\nThe UK and United States recording's B-side was [Pete\nSeeger](/wiki/Pete_Seeger \"Pete Seeger\")'s \"[Turn! Turn!\nTurn!](/wiki/Turn!_Turn!_Turn! \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\")\", which had been a United\nStates number-one hit for [The Byrds](/wiki/The_Byrds \"The Byrds\") in 1965.\n\n\"Those Were the Days\" was catalogue number APPLE 2 (the APPLE 1 number had\nbeen given to an unreleased version of \"[The Lady Is a\nTramp](/wiki/The_Lady_Is_a_Tramp \"The Lady Is a Tramp\")\" by [Frank\nSinatra](/wiki/Frank_Sinatra \"Frank Sinatra\"), recorded specially in 1968, for\n[Maureen Starkey](/wiki/Maureen_Starkey_Tigrett \"Maureen Starkey Tigrett\")'s\n22nd birthday, as a gift from [Ringo Starr](/wiki/Ringo_Starr \"Ringo Starr\"),\nunder the name of \"The Lady is a Champ\"). It was the second single to be\nreleased on the Apple label, the first — \"Hey Jude\" by the Beatles —had\nretained the sequential catalogue numbers used by\n[Parlophone](/wiki/Parlophone \"Parlophone\") (in the UK) and\n[Capitol](/wiki/Capitol_Records \"Capitol Records\") (in the US).\n\nHopkin's version was released on the back of her success on the television\ntalent show _[Opportunity Knocks](/wiki/Opportunity_Knocks_\\(UK_TV_series\\)\n\"Opportunity Knocks \\(UK TV series\\)\")_ , and around the time of its release\npopular singer Sandie Shaw was also asked to record the song by her\nmanagement, feeling that it should be done by a \"real\" singer. Shaw's version\nwas released as a single, but did not match the success of Hopkin's version.\n\nAt the peak of the song's success, a New York company used the melody in a\ncommercial for Rokeach [gefilte fish](/wiki/Gefilte_fish \"Gefilte fish\"),\narguing that the tune was an old Russian folk-tune and thus in the public\ndomain. (The commercial included the line \"The perfect dish, Rokeach Gefilte\nFish\" where the English-language song would go \"Those were the days, oh yes,\nthose were the days.\") Raskin successfully sued and won a settlement, since he\nhad slightly altered the tune to fit his lyrics and had taken out the valid\nnew copyright.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, after Hopkin's contract with Apple ended, \"Those Were the\nDays\" and \"Goodbye\" were re-recorded with producer [Tony\nVisconti](/wiki/Tony_Visconti \"Tony Visconti\"), whom she had married in 1971.\nThese re-recorded versions can be found on music compilations.\n\nOn 25 October 2010, Apple Records released _[Come and Get It: The Best of\nApple Records](/wiki/Come_and_Get_It:_The_Best_of_Apple_Records \"Come and Get\nIt: The Best of Apple Records\")_ , which included the original recordings of\n\"Those Were the Days\" and \"Goodbye\". The greatest hits compilation album\ncontained songs by artists signed to the Beatles' Apple record label between\n1968 and 1973, the first such multi-artist Apple compilation.\n\nOn Christmas 1975, the President of [Equatorial\nGuinea](/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea \"Equatorial Guinea\"), [Francisco Macías\nNguema](/wiki/Francisco_Mac%C3%ADas_Nguema \"Francisco Macías Nguema\"), had 150\nalleged coup plotters executed in the national stadium while a band played\n\"Those Were the Days\".[13]\n\n##\nRecordings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Those_Were_the_Days_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Recordings\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This article **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.
