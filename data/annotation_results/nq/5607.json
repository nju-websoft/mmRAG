His youngest daughter, Belle\n([Léa Seydoux](/wiki/L%C3%A9a_Seydoux \"Léa Seydoux\")) is the only one happy\nwith the change. When one of the merchant's ships is found, the merchant\nprepares to return to reclaim his assets. While his two older, spoiled\ndaughters give him a long list of expensive things to bring back for them,\nBelle asks only for a rose. The merchant arrives and learns that the ship and\nits cargo have been taken to settle his debts. On the way home through the\nforest, the merchant loses his way, his horse slips and is injured, and they\nare attacked by wolves. He laments that he has \"not even a weapon to finish\noff\" the poor horse. The merchant stumbles upon the magical domain of the\nBeast ([Vincent Cassel](/wiki/Vincent_Cassel \"Vincent Cassel\")). In the\ncastle, all of his needs are magically met, including food, the exact items\nhis daughters had asked him to bring, and his horse, magically cured. He packs\nup and departs with the items. Passing through the garden, he recalls Belle's\nrequest of a rose, and he picks one. He is immediately confronted by the\nBeast, who thunders at him for taking the rose. As punishment, the Beast\ndemands the merchant return to the castle in one day after saying goodbye to\nhis children. If he fails to return, his family will be killed. The father\nreturns home and tells the story to his children. Learning of her father's\nfate, Belle, feeling responsible, takes her father's horse and returns to the\ncastle to offer herself in the place of her father.\n\nAt the castle, Belle is accepted as a substitute for her father. She is given\nluxurious goods, and allowed to roam the grounds, but must return every\nevening for dinner with the Beast. The Beast asks Belle if she will love him,\nbut she rejects him. At night, Belle has a series of vivid dreams, revealing\nthe backstory of the Prince: he enjoys hunting, but often ignores the Princess\n([Yvonne Catterfeld](/wiki/Yvonne_Catterfeld \"Yvonne Catterfeld\")) who loves\nhim but is lonely. The Prince is after an elusive golden deer, and when the\nPrincess asks him to stop hunting the deer, he promises to do so if she will\ngive him a son. The prince later announces that they will have an heir, but\nwhen the princess reminds him of his promise, he seems to have forgotten.\nBelle makes the Beast a proposal; she will dance with him, if she is allowed\nto see her family one last time. The two begin to dance, and the Beast once\nagain asks for Belle's love. Jarred, Belle demands to see her family as she\nhad bargained. When the Beast refuses, Belle fervently rejects him. The same\nnight, she witnesses the Beast prey upon and devour a hog. In shock, she\nattempts to escape by running into the enchanted forest, and falls into a\nfrozen lake. The Beast pulls her from the water, and brings her to the castle.\nBelle has a final dream about how the Prince broke his promise and killed the\ngolden deer. While dying, the deer transformed into the Princess, who revealed\nthat she was the Nymph of the Forest who became human because she wanted to\nexperience love. She begged her father, the god of the forest, to spare the\nprince from his anger, but he transformed the prince into a beast, changed the\nhunting dogs into Tadommes and his friends into statues. The god of the forest\nproclaimed that only the love of a woman would break the Beast's eternal\ncurse.\n\nThe Beast agrees to let Belle return home, giving her a small vial of healing\nwater. He tells her return to him in one day or he will \"die\". Belle arrives\nhome, where her father is bedridden, and seems to be dying. Belle gives him\nthe vial of water, reviving him. Belle's eldest brother, Maxime ([Nicolas\nGob](/wiki/Nicolas_Gob \"Nicolas Gob\")) finds a jewel on her clothing, positing\nthat the castle may contain further treasures. He wants to find it to settle\nhis debt to gangster Perducas ([Eduardo\nNoriega](/wiki/Eduardo_Noriega_\\(Spanish_actor\\) \"Eduardo Noriega \\(Spanish\nactor\\)\")). He knocks out his youngest brother, Tristan, who tries to stop\nhim, and meets with Perducas and his gang, leading them to the castle. Belle\nattempts to return to the castle, and discovers that Maxime has taken the\nhorse to meet with Perducas. Tristan takes her to the castle, arriving just as\nthe Beast is about to kill the invaders, including Belle's brothers. The Beast\nstops his attack when Belle begs for mercy. Perducas stabs the Beast, mortally\nwounding him. Belle and her brothers carry the Beast into the castle, and\nplace him into the healing pool of water. Dying, the Beast asks whether Belle\ncould ever love him, and she counters that she already does. The Beast sinks\ninto the water, and comes up transformed back into the Prince. The Tadommes\nreturn to dogs, and Perducas is killed by the vines and turned into a human\ntree.\n\nThe story is being told by Belle to her two young children. They are living in\nthe same countryside house, surrounded by rose bushes, with Belle's father,\nwho is now a flower merchant. Belle goes outside to greet her husband, the\nPrince, and the two kiss and embrace.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2014_film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Vincent Cassel](/wiki/Vincent_Cassel \"Vincent Cassel\") as La Bête (The Beast) / Le Prince (The Prince)\n  * [Léa Seydoux](/wiki/L%C3%A9a_Seydoux \"Léa Seydoux\") as Belle\n  * [André Dussollier](/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Dussollier \"André Dussollier\") as Le marchand (The Merchant) / Belle's Father\n  * [Eduardo Noriega](/wiki/Eduardo_Noriega_\\(Spanish_actor\\) \"Eduardo Noriega \\(Spanish actor\\)\") as Perducas\n  * [Audrey Lamy](/wiki/Audrey_Lamy \"Audrey Lamy\") as Anne\n  * [Sara Giraudeau](/wiki/Sara_Giraudeau \"Sara Giraudeau\") as Clotilde\n  * [Nicolas Gob](/wiki/Nicolas_Gob \"Nicolas Gob\") as Maxime\n  * Myriam Charleins as [Astrid](/wiki/Skyrim \"Skyrim\")\n  * Jonathan Demurge as Jean-Baptiste\n  * Louka Meliava as Tristan\n  * [Yvonne Catterfeld](/wiki/Yvonne_Catterfeld \"Yvonne Catterfeld\") as La Princesse (The Princess)\n  * Dejan Bucin as Louis\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2014_film\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\ntook place in Germany, at the [Babelsberg Studio](/wiki/Babelsberg_Studio\n\"Babelsberg Studio\") in [Potsdam-Babelsberg](/wiki/Potsdam-Babelsberg\n\"Potsdam-Babelsberg\"), from November 2012 to February 2013, on a production\nbudget of €35 million.[9]\n\n## Box\noffice[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2014_film\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Box office\")]\n\nThe film earned a total of US$49.1 million internationally.[10] In Japan, the\nfilm topped the box office on its release, making it the first non-English-\nlanguage foreign film to top the Japanese box office since _[Red Cliff\nII](/wiki/Red_Cliff_\\(film\\) \"Red Cliff \\(film\\)\")_ in 2009, and the first\nFrench film to top the Japanese box office since [Mathieu\nKassovitz](/wiki/Mathieu_Kassovitz \"Mathieu Kassovitz\")'s _[The Crimson\nRivers](/wiki/The_Crimson_Rivers \"The Crimson Rivers\")_ in 2001.[11]\n\n## Critical\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2014_film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Critical reception\")]\n\nIn France, the film received positive reviews.[12] [France\nTélévisions](/wiki/France_T%C3%A9l%C3%A9visions \"France Télévisions\") called\nthe film Christophe Gans' \"greatest success\". They praised the colours and\ncontrasts of the landscape, which they said recalled the work of American\npainter [Maxfield Parrish](/wiki/Maxfield_Parrish \"Maxfield Parrish\"), and the\nvisual style, which they compared to films by [Mario Bava](/wiki/Mario_Bava\n\"Mario Bava\") and [Tsui Hark](/wiki/Tsui_Hark \"Tsui Hark\"). They also noted\nthat Gans had successfully differentiated the film from the source material\nand prior adaptations, while keeping the \"spirit\" of the original story.[13]\nLaurent Pecha of EcranLarge remarked that while the film was \"far from\nperfect\", it was \"so ambitious\" compared to the \"doldrums\" of French cinema\nthat Gans won her over. She called the introduction \"spectacular\" and praised\nGans for his willingness to make the audience believe the \"incredible and\nimprobable love story\", praising the \"excellent\" Seydoux and Cassel.[14]\nWriting for [TF1](/wiki/TF1 \"TF1\"), Olivier Corriez gave the film 4 stars out\nof 5 and remarked that it was not easy to offer a modern interpretation of\n_Beauty and the Beast_ as it had been adapted so many times before, but found\nGans' film \"flamboyant\" but \"accessible to all audiences\". He said that it\n\"plays wonderfully on contrasts\" and praised Seydoux for her \"charm and\ntenderness\" and Cassel for providing \"brutality [and] weakness.\"[15]\n\nInternational reviews for the film were mostly negative. Although the visuals\nand production design were praised, storytelling was criticized. On [review\naggregator](/wiki/Review_aggregator \"Review aggregator\") website [Rotten\nTomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\"), the film has a rating of\n32%, based on 19 reviews and the average rating is 4.6/10.[16] On\n[Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\"), which assigns a normalised rating\nout of 100, the film has a score of 39 based on 10 reviews, indicating\n\"generally unfavorable reviews\".[17]\n\nJessica Kiang of _[Indiewire](/wiki/Indiewire \"Indiewire\")_ thought the film\nwas \"immensely, crushingly boring\" and Seydoux wasted in a role that required\nher to do little more than \"heave her breasts and fall over things\nprettily.\"[18]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2014_film\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Beauty and the Beast (disambiguation)](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(disambiguation\\)\")\n  * [List of French films of 2014](/wiki/List_of_French_films_of_2014 \"List of French films of 2014\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2014_film\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"La Belle et La Bête\"](http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=203397.html). _AlloCiné_.
