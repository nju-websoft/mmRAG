Although the military has\nattempted to implement tobacco control initiatives, the association between\nsmoking and military personnel has persisted to the present day as smoking\nrates remain high, despite declines in civilian rates. Such high rates have\nled to questions about the effect of smoking from the apparent health risks to\ntroop readiness and training costs.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Smoking in the US military from 1918 to 1975\n  * 2 Attempts at tobacco control initiatives\n    * 2.1 Tobacco industry's response\n  * 3 Present-day smoking in the US military\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Smoking in the US military from 1918 to\n1975[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smoking_in_the_United_States_military&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Smoking in the US military from 1918 to 1975\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Omaha_Beach_wounded_soldiers%2C_1944-06-06.gif/200px-\nOmaha_Beach_wounded_soldiers%2C_1944-06-06.gif)](/wiki/File:Omaha_Beach_wounded_soldiers,_1944-06-06.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Omaha_Beach_wounded_soldiers,_1944-06-06.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nWounded soldiers at [Omaha Beach](/wiki/Omaha_Beach \"Omaha Beach\") on D-Day\n\nWith the entrance of the United States into World War I in 1918, cigarette use\nincreased dramatically among United States military personnel as they were\ntargeted by tobacco companies which touted cigarettes as a way for soldiers to\npsychologically escape from their current circumstances, boosting overall\ntroop morale.[1][2] Cigarettes became so integrated into life on the\nbattlefield that these symbols of pleasure and comfort were also used as a\nform of currency.[2] Although cigarettes had been regarded as a physical and\nmoral hazard by early anti-tobacco movements around this time, by 1918,\npreviously anti-cigarette organizations and the military began supporting\nefforts to distribute cigarettes to troops. _[The New York\nTimes](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ garnered support for\nthese efforts by stating that cigarettes \"lighten[ed] the inevitable hardships\nof war\", and another popular periodical described cigarettes as the \"last and\nonly solace of the wounded.\" [1][3] With the rise of World War II, tobacco\ncompanies continued to foster this culture of wartime smoking by sending free\ncigarettes to troops and supporting the inclusion of cigarettes into the\nsoldiers' rations. Advertisements also encouraged citizens back home to\nsupport the troops by sending cigarettes.[2][4] In 1965, first during the U.S.\nArmy’s Basic Training Course & later in Pre-Airborne Infantry Training, while\nbeing allowed a break from P.T., or during a long march, it was commonplace\nfor a Drill Sergeant to say \"smoke ’em if you got ’em, do pushups if you\ndon’t\". Non-smoking soldiers would quickly \"bum\" a cigarette from a friend &\nthey too would soon be smokers.[4] Despite mounting evidence in the 1950s of\nthe adverse health effects of smoking and tobacco use, the military continued\nto include cigarettes in rations until 1975.[5]\n\n## Attempts at tobacco control\ninitiatives[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smoking_in_the_United_States_military&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Attempts at tobacco control initiatives\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/US_Navy_040923-N-8158F-012_Airman_Camilo_Torres%2C_of_Brooklyn%2C_N.Y.%2C_participates_in_a_scheduled_Prevent_course.jpg/200px-\nUS_Navy_040923-N-8158F-012_Airman_Camilo_Torres%2C_of_Brooklyn%2C_N.Y.%2C_participates_in_a_scheduled_Prevent_course.jpg)](/wiki/File:US_Navy_040923-N-8158F-012_Airman_Camilo_Torres,_of_Brooklyn,_N.Y.,_participates_in_a_scheduled_Prevent_course.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:US_Navy_040923-N-8158F-012_Airman_Camilo_Torres,_of_Brooklyn,_N.Y.,_participates_in_a_scheduled_Prevent_course.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Prevent\" course booklet, participant workbook September 2003, including\ntobacco issues.\n\nWith the scientific data about the health risks of smoking and information\nabout the effect of smoking on troop readiness, in 1975, the [United States\nDepartment of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense \"United\nStates Department of Defense\") discontinued the inclusion of cigarettes in\n[K-rations](/wiki/K-ration \"K-ration\") and [C-rations](/wiki/C-ration\n\"C-ration\"). By 1978, the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking\nregulations, including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas.[5] In\n1985, the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking\nrates of military personnel (47%) were significantly higher than that of US\ncivilians (30%) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop\nreadiness.[6] The report also cited an estimated tobacco-related healthcare\ncosts as high as $209.9 million, and recommended potential methods to curb\nsmoking in the military, including the elimination of tobacco products from\nstores, raising tobacco prices to civilian levels, and the implementation of\nan educational program to discourage smoking.[5][6] In 1986, the DoD Directive\n1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense [Caspar\nWeinberger](/wiki/Caspar_Weinberger \"Caspar Weinberger\"), who announced, \"an\nintense anti-smoking campaign…at all levels of all Services.\" [6] It\nestablished a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as\nalcohol consumption. The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic\ntraining, increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas, and prohibited\nhealth care providers from smoking on duty. The goal of the policy was to\nreduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians, and to reduce\npersonnel and active duty rates from 52% to 25% by 1990.[6] In 1992, the\n[DeCA](/wiki/Defense_Commissary_Agency \"Defense Commissary Agency\") Directive\n40-13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with\npromotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military\npersonnel, and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back. In 1993,\nthe [USS  _Theodore Roosevelt_\n(CVN-71)](/wiki/USS_Theodore_Roosevelt_\\(CVN-71\\) \"USS Theodore Roosevelt\n\\(CVN-71\\)\") became the first smoke-free Navy ship.[7] By 1994, the Department\nof Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in\nworkplaces, designated outdoor smoking areas, and created the precursor of an\neducation program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on\nthe health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit. [Executive\nOrder](/wiki/Executive_order_\\(United_States\\) \"Executive order \\(United\nStates\\)\") 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government-owned, rented, or\nleased interior spaces, but the Department of Defense approved a three-year\nphase-in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on\nDecember 7, 2002.[5] Despite these attempts, by 1988, the smoking rate had\nonly decreased to 42% and far exceeded the rate of civilians.[6] And although\nprevalence did decrease to 29.9% from 1980 to 1998, it has increased since\nthen and appears to still be increasing.[3]\n\n### Tobacco industry's\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smoking_in_the_United_States_military&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Tobacco industry's response\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/3d_Battalion_3d_Marines_Mutters_Ridge_1969.jpg/200px-3d_Battalion_3d_Marines_Mutters_Ridge_1969.jpg)](/wiki/File:3d_Battalion_3d_Marines_Mutters_Ridge_1969.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:3d_Battalion_3d_Marines_Mutters_Ridge_1969.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Vietnam War](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\"), 1969.\n\nRealizing the opportunities of a worldwide military market due to the young\ndemographics of military personnel and the smoking initiation associated with\nnew recruits, the [Tobacco Institute](/wiki/Tobacco_Institute \"Tobacco\nInstitute\"), which served as the tobacco industry's [lobbying\norganization](/wiki/Lobbying_organization \"Lobbying organization\"), and\n[Philip Morris](/wiki/Altria \"Altria\") perceived these new tobacco control\ninitiatives as a threat and conceived strategies to circumvent the government\npolicies. Another incentive for the tobacco industry to protect its military\nmarket was the recognized phenomenon that consumer product preferences\ndeveloped during years serving in the military would later translate into\ncivilian market profits as service members left the military or retired.[5]\nAfter the implementation of Directive 1010.10 in 1986, the Tobacco Institute\nand Philip Morris immediately began seeking the support of tobacco-friendly\npoliticians against the policy, citing that the policy would have a negative\nimpact on military recruitment, retention, and morale. Furthermore, letters\nsent to Secretary of Defense Weinberger from politicians invoked rhetoric\nabout the infringement of \"personal rights\" and \"an individual's right to\nsmoke.\" Such political [lobbying](/wiki/Lobbying \"Lobbying\") helped to limit\nthe implementation and the further extension of Directive 1010.10.[6]\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense had discontinued the practice of free\ndistribution of cigarettes during wartime, tobacco companies began campaigns\nduring the [Gulf War](/wiki/Gulf_War \"Gulf War\") (1990-1991) to distribute\nfree cigarettes to soldiers stationed in [Saudi Arabia](/wiki/Saudi_Arabia\n\"Saudi Arabia\"), but would eventually be rebuffed by the Department of\nDefense. Regardless, Philip Morris then began a campaign of sales through\ndirect mail, and extended promotions to deployed troops that included the\ndelivery of branded goods such as playing cards and cup cozies. Curiously\nenough, the military actually assisted the tobacco companies in delivering\nshipments to military stores in Saudi Arabia at government expense. Another\ncontroversy arose when it was discovered that [RJ\nReynolds](/wiki/R._J._Reynolds_Tobacco_Company \"R. J. Reynolds Tobacco\nCompany\") had placed their company name on the front and a\n[Camel](/wiki/Camel_\\(cigarette\\) \"Camel \\(cigarette\\)\") advertisement on the\nback of donated magazines from Operation Desert News, a civilian project to\nbring magazines to the troops. In spite of the initial rejection by the\nDepartment of Defense due to the advertisement, constant pressure from RJ\nReynolds and politicians allowed the magazines to be delivered with the\nadvertisement at government expense, violating military policy that forbade\ntobacco-branded promotions directed at military personnel.[3] In addition,\nPhilip Morris focused on promoting the [Marlboro](/wiki/Marlboro_\\(cigarette\\)\n\"Marlboro \\(cigarette\\)\") brand with the goal of fostering corporate good will\nby initiating the \"Marlboro holiday voice card\" program.[3][5] Held on 10\nmilitary bases, they invited family of deployed personnel to record a message\nfor onto a chip inserted into a greeting card, and later allowed bases to\nextend the recording of such messages to the public. Despite being in\nviolation of Department of Defense policy concerning tobacco-branded programs\ndirected at military personnel, Philip Morris had received permission to carry\nout the program from the [Defense Logistics\nAgency](/wiki/Defense_Logistics_Agency \"Defense Logistics Agency\"), the\n[Morale, Welfare and Recreation](/wiki/Morale,_Welfare_and_Recreation \"Morale,\nWelfare and Recreation\") headquarters of the services, and base commanders.\nFurthermore, after troops were withdrawn from the conflict in 1991, tobacco\ncompanies sponsored \"Welcome Home\" events for returning troops featuring\nextensive brand promotion.[3] Although the Department of Defense had enacted\npolicies to reduce tobacco use amongst personnel, the successful efforts of\ntobacco companies as well as the cultural factors of smoking in the military\nhave produced a mixed message of tobacco promotion and reduction to military\npersonnel.\n\n## Present-day smoking in the US\nmilitary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smoking_in_the_United_States_military&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Present-day smoking in the US military\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/US_Navy_101118-N-3560G-001_Tracy_Navarrete%2C_center%2C_the_Health_Promotions_Officer_at_Naval_Health_Clinic%2C_Hawaii%2C_educates_service_members_on_the_d.jpg/200px-\nUS_Navy_101118-N-3560G-001_Tracy_Navarrete%2C_center%2C_the_Health_Promotions_Officer_at_Naval_Health_Clinic%2C_Hawaii%2C_educates_service_members_on_the_d.jpg)](/wiki/File:US_Navy_101118-N-3560G-001_Tracy_Navarrete,_center,_the_Health_Promotions_Officer_at_Naval_Health_Clinic,_Hawaii,_educates_service_members_on_the_d.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:US_Navy_101118-N-3560G-001_Tracy_Navarrete,_center,_the_Health_Promotions_Officer_at_Naval_Health_Clinic,_Hawaii,_educates_service_members_on_the_d.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nNaval Health Clinic, Hawaii, 2010.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/US_Navy_101118-N-1938G-001_independent_duty_corpsman_assigned_to_the_Ohio-\nclass_ballistic-\nmissile_submarine_USS_Rhode_Island_%28SSBN_740%29_shares_info.jpg/200px-\nUS_Navy_101118-N-1938G-001_independent_duty_corpsman_assigned_to_the_Ohio-\nclass_ballistic-\nmissile_submarine_USS_Rhode_Island_%28SSBN_740%29_shares_info.jpg)](/wiki/File:US_Navy_101118-N-1938G-001_independent_duty_corpsman_assigned_to_the_Ohio-\nclass_ballistic-\nmissile_submarine_USS_Rhode_Island_\\(SSBN_740\\)_shares_info.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:US_Navy_101118-N-1938G-001_independent_duty_corpsman_assigned_to_the_Ohio-\nclass_ballistic-\nmissile_submarine_USS_Rhode_Island_\\(SSBN_740\\)_shares_info.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay](/wiki/Naval_Submarine_Base_Kings_Bay \"Naval\nSubmarine Base Kings Bay\") Medical Clinic, 2010.\n\nIn 2005, the smoking rate of military personnel was found to be 32.2%,\ncompared to the civilian rate of 21%.[3] The higher smoking rate suggests that\ncertain aspects of military may foster smoking. These factors include peer\ninfluence, combat stress, boredom, and easy access to cheap tobacco\nproducts.[8] Another factor that may lead to increased tobacco use is\ndeployment. One study found that among nonsmokers, smoking initiation was\nobserved in 1.3% of nondeployed personnel while 2.3% were observed in deployed\npersonnel. Among past smokers, resumption of smoking occurred in 28.7% of non\ndeployed personnel and 39.4% of deployed personnel, while smoking increased\n44% among the former and 57% among the latter.[9] US troops in Iraq and\nAfghanistan have been reported to smoke at twice the rate of other\nAmericans.[10] Even after leaving the service, many veterans continue to smoke\nas the prevalence of smoking among veterans has been reported to be 27% during\n2003 to 2007, and military smoking is strongly associated with increased\nlifelong cigarette consumption.[11] Such high levels of smoking have led to\nsignificant costs to the Department of Defense. The costs of smoking among US\nmilitary health care system beneficiaries have been estimated to be more than\n$900 million per year in 1995, with $584 million in direct health care costs\nand $346 million in lost productivity among active duty personnel.[11]\nSuicide, which accounts for 13% of fatalities in the military, has also been\ntied to smoking, as the risk of suicide among military men was found to\nincrease significantly with the number of cigarettes smoked daily.[12] Smoking\nalso affects training costs as smokers are more likely to be discharged during\ntraining, and are associated with $18 million per year in excess training\ncosts for the [US Air Force](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force \"United States Air\nForce\"), and over $130 million per year for all service branches.[13]\n\nNote that the figures regarding smoking and suicide and manpower losses during\ntraining may represent more of a symptomatic relationship than a causative\none. Many discharges during basic training result from a series of minor\ninfractions, punished administratively as opposed to by courts-martial, which\nare seen as an indicator that the trainee cannot or will not adjust to\nmilitary life, rather than any single incident or serious violation of\nregulations. With smoking now prohibited in basic training, being caught\nsmoking, and perhaps even being caught in the possession of cigarettes, is\nsuch an offense which smokers are obviously at risk for while non smokers are\nnot. Regarding suicide, the figures showing increased rates of smoking and\nresumption of smoking among those deployed indicates that smoking may be a\nreaction to and indicator or increased stress, and a person who is potentially\nsuicidal would obviously be under a more than typical degree of stress, so\nincreased smoking may be an indicator of that excessive stress rather than a\ncause for increased risk of suicide. Also, a higher rate of smoking among\nthose discharged during training may also be indicative of individuals for\nwhom training is more than normally stressful, and such persons would likely\nexperience more difficulty in successfully completing training than one who is\nnot unusually (compared to his/her peers)stressed by it.\n\nIn 2008 unauthorized smoking and improper storage of chemicals caused major\ndamage to [USS George Washington\n(CVN-73)](/wiki/USS_George_Washington_\\(CVN-73\\) \"USS George Washington\n\\(CVN-73\\)\").[14]\n\nThe Department of Defense hoped to lower rates of tobacco use to 12% by the\nend of 2010.[6] To achieve their goal, [Pentagon](/wiki/The_Pentagon \"The\nPentagon\") health experts have begun to urge the Defense Secretary [Robert\nGates](/wiki/Robert_Gates \"Robert Gates\") to ban the use of tobacco by troops\nand end its sale on military property.[15] The [Navy](/wiki/United_States_Navy\n\"United States Navy\") implemented a ban on smoking in submarines by the end of\n2010 – highlighting one of the last loopholes in the indoor smoking ban\nimposed in 1994.[16]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smoking_in_the_United_States_military&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [U.S. government and smoking cessation](/wiki/U.S._government_and_smoking_cessation \"U.S. government and smoking cessation\")\n  * [Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States](/wiki/Smoking_and_Health:_Report_of_the_Advisory_Committee_to_the_Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States \"Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States\")\n  * [Operation Sandblast](/wiki/Operation_Sandblast \"Operation Sandblast\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smoking_in_the_United_States_military&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Brandt, Allan M. 2007. _The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America_.
