He worked in\nCincinnati as a machinist before moving to New Ulm, where he established a\nmill and then a brewery. The brewery grew in size and production. When August\nSchell died, he passed ownership to his son Otto Schell; Otto Schell died in\n1911. George Marti, August Schell's son-in-law, took over the brewery, and it\nhas been in the hands of the Marti family since that time.[3]\n\n## Contemporary\nBeer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=August_Schell_Brewing_Company&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Contemporary Beer\")]\n\n### Year-round\nBrews[[edit](/w/index.php?title=August_Schell_Brewing_Company&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Year-round Brews\")]\n\n  * **Original _(aka Deer Brand)_** , _ABV 4.8%_ , Straw colored classic American lager.

The aroma is a combination of fruity esters from the yeast complimented by the citrusy notes of coriander, orange, and lemon peel.

Higher carbonation levels give this beer a full bodied mouth feel and a fluffy, creamy head with a banana and clove aroma.\n  * **2009 - Baltic Porter** , _ABV 5.8%_ , Few beers fit the season like a Baltic Porter does winter. The 2009 edition of Snowstorm was brewed with copious amounts of Munich malt coupled with three different British crystal malts, and British Chocolate.
