She is of Cherokee Native American descent on her\nmother's side.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] She has an older brother Jay, who passed away\nAugust 29, 2018, and a younger brother named Cliff. Tylo has been credited as\n**Deborah Morehart** ; Morehart was the last name of her first husband.\n\n##\nCareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hunter_Tylo&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Career\")]\n\nIn 1984, credited as Deborah Morehart, Tylo appeared in the sorority [slasher\nfilm](/wiki/Slasher_film \"Slasher film\") _[The\nInitiation](/wiki/The_Initiation_\\(film\\) \"The Initiation \\(film\\)\")_ with\nfuture _[Melrose Place](/wiki/Melrose_Place \"Melrose Place\")_ actress [Daphne\nZuniga](/wiki/Daphne_Zuniga \"Daphne Zuniga\"). Tylo subsequently became well\nknown after playing regular roles in US daytime [soap operas](/wiki/Soap_opera\n\"Soap opera\"). Her television debut was on _[All My\nChildren](/wiki/All_My_Children \"All My Children\")_ in\n[1985](/wiki/1985_in_television \"1985 in television\"). She was fired from the\nrole in 1988, on the grounds of having a relationship with another cast\nmember, [Michael Tylo](/wiki/Michael_Tylo \"Michael Tylo\") (whom she married in\n1987).[1]\n\nIn 1989, she was cast as Marina Toscano on _[Days of Our\nLives](/wiki/Days_of_Our_Lives \"Days of Our Lives\")_. The character was a\nrival who caused trouble for one of the soap's most popular couples, [Steven\n\"Patch\" Johnson](/wiki/Steve_Johnson_\\(Days_of_our_Lives\\) \"Steve Johnson\n\\(Days of our Lives\\)\") and [Kayla Brady](/wiki/Kayla_Brady \"Kayla Brady\").\nTylo later said, \"Everyone hated my character.[...]I hated her. They\n[producers] said they were going to do something with her, but they never did.\n[...] I dreaded going to work for the last few weeks I was on the show.\" The\ncharacter was [killed off](/wiki/Killed_off \"Killed off\") and Tylo left the\nseries in 1990.\n\nDiscouraged by her lack of success on soap operas, Tylo decided to quit\nacting, and enrolled at [Fordham University](/wiki/Fordham_University \"Fordham\nUniversity\") in the [Bronx, New York](/wiki/Bronx,_New_York \"Bronx, New\nYork\"), intending to be a [pre-med](/wiki/Pre-med \"Pre-med\") student. As she\nand her husband were preparing to move to [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City\n\"New York City\"), she was offered a role of [Dr. Taylor\nHayes](/wiki/Taylor_Hayes_\\(The_Bold_and_the_Beautiful\\) \"Taylor Hayes \\(The\nBold and the Beautiful\\)\") on _[The Bold and the\nBeautiful](/wiki/The_Bold_and_the_Beautiful \"The Bold and the Beautiful\")_.\nShe initially resisted the part but eventually relented. She began her tenure\nin 1990, while still pursuing her degree at Fordham.[1]\n\nIn 2000, Tylo released her autobiography, _Making a Miracle_.[2] Tylo left\n_The Bold and the Beautiful_ in 2002. She returned to the show in 2004 for a\ntwo-episode appearance as a vision.[3] In May 2005, she returned as a series\nregular and left the series again in July 2013.[3][4] In 2014 she returned to\nthe show for a several weeks story arc.\n\n###\nLawsuit[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hunter_Tylo&action=edit&section=3&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Lawsuit\")]\n\nIn 1996, Tylo was cast in the primetime soap opera _[Melrose\nPlace](/wiki/Melrose_Place \"Melrose Place\")_ and opted to leave _The Bold and\nthe Beautiful_ to take the role. However, she was fired by _Melrose Place_\nproducer [Aaron Spelling](/wiki/Aaron_Spelling \"Aaron Spelling\") prior to\nfilming any episodes for the series, when she announced she was pregnant. The\ncharacter she was to play, Taylor McBride, was recast, [Lisa\nRinna](/wiki/Lisa_Rinna \"Lisa Rinna\") taking the role. Tylo quickly returned\nto _The Bold and the Beautiful_. Tylo sued Spelling on grounds of\ndiscrimination for being pregnant and won $4.8 million from a Los Angeles\njury. Spelling argued that Tylo's pregnancy rendered her unable to play the\ncharacter, who was supposed to be a sexy seductress. During the trial, Tylo\npublished pictures of herself while pregnant which showed that she retained a\nslim figure. Prior to trial, during the [discovery](/wiki/Discovery_\\(law\\)\n\"Discovery \\(law\\)\") phase of the [litigation](/wiki/Litigation \"Litigation\"),\nTylo's lawyers won a partial victory in an interlocutory appeal challenging a\nlower court's order compelling her to answer a broad range of personal\nquestions. The Court of Appeal established Tylo's right to refuse to answer\nquestions in her deposition about marital problems and psychological\ntreatment, although the Court sustained the portion of the order which\ncompelled her to answer questions about her efforts to become pregnant, her\nhusband's ability or inability to impregnate her, and communications with her\nagent with respect to her efforts and ability to become pregnant. The case is\nwidely recognized as an important one in establishing the right of privacy in\ndeposition and the right of actresses to continue to work while pregnant.[5]\n\n## Personal\nlife[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hunter_Tylo&action=edit&section=4&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Personal life\")]\n\n### Marriages and\nchildren[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hunter_Tylo&action=edit&section=5&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Marriages and children\")]\n\nTylo has been married three times and has four children. She married her first\nhusband, Tom Morehart, in 1980. They have a son, Christopher \"Chris\" Morehart,\nand divorced in 1984.[3]\n\nIn 1987, she married actor [Michael Tylo](/wiki/Michael_Tylo \"Michael Tylo\"),\nwith whom she had daughters Izabella Gabrielle and Katya Ariel Tylo and son\nMichael Edward \"Mickey\" Tylo, Jr. In 1998, the couple's daughter Katya was\ndiagnosed with a rare cancer of the eye called\n[retinoblastoma](/wiki/Retinoblastoma \"Retinoblastoma\"). Doctors removed the\naffected right eye and began [chemotherapy](/wiki/Chemotherapy\n\"Chemotherapy\"). Later in the year a tumor was detected in Katya's other eye;\nthat tumor inexplicably disappeared. Katya recovered and wears a prosthetic\nright eye.[6] The couple divorced in 2005. On October 18, 2007, their son,\nMichael Tylo, Jr., drowned in the family pool in [Henderson,\nNevada](/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada \"Henderson, Nevada\").[7] The [Clark County\nCoroner](/wiki/Clark_County_Coroner \"Clark County Coroner\") concluded that\nMichael Tylo, Jr.'s death was caused by \"drowning due to seizure disorder,\"\nand was ruled [accidental](/wiki/Accident \"Accident\").[8]\n\nIn May 2008, Tylo filed a restraining order against boyfriend Corey Cofield,\nclaiming that he had acted violently towards her and her children.\n\nShortly after the death of her mother, Joanne Hunter, on November 29, 2009,\nTylo married Gersson Archila in a secret ceremony in [Las\nVegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas \"Las Vegas\"), [Nevada](/wiki/Nevada \"Nevada\").[9] The\nmarriage was annulled on August 30, 2018 due to Court findings of Gersson\nbeing of poor moral character; 3 convicted counts of spousal abuse, auto\ntheft, drug paraphernalia, misrepresentation by false identity, and hiding a\ncriminal past.\n\n###\nReligion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hunter_Tylo&action=edit&section=6&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Religion\")]\n\nTylo is a [born again Christian](/wiki/Born_again_\\(Christianity\\) \"Born again\n\\(Christianity\\)\").[6][10] She attributes her daughter Katya's recovery from\ncancer to constant prayer and credits her faith for helping her deal with the\ndeath of her son, Michael.[11][12]\n\n##\nFilmography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hunter_Tylo&action=edit&section=7&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Filmography\")]\n\n###\nFilm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hunter_Tylo&action=edit&section=8&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Film\")]\n\nYear  | Title  | Role  | Notes  | Ref   \n---|---|---|---|---  \n1984  | _[The Initiation](/wiki/The_Initiation_\\(film\\) \"The Initiation \\(film\\)\")_ | Alison  | Credited as Deborah Morehart  |   \n1988  | _Final Cut_ | Anna  | Credited as Deborah Morehart  |   \n2001  | _[Longshot](/wiki/Longshot_\\(film\\) \"Longshot \\(film\\)\")_ | Rachel Montgomery  |  |   \n2004  | _A Place Called Home_ | Billie Jeeters  | TV film  |   \n_They Are Among Us_ | June  | TV film  |   \n2005  | _[Down and Derby](/wiki/Down_and_Derby \"Down and Derby\")_ | Teri Montana  |  |   \n_[Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy](/wiki/Hammerhead:_Shark_Frenzy \"Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy\")_ | Amelia Lockhart  | [Syfy](/wiki/Syfy \"Syfy\") TV film  |   \n  \n###\nTelevision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hunter_Tylo&action=edit&section=9&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Television\")]\n\nYear  | Title  | Role  | Notes  | Ref   \n---|---|---|---|---  \n1985–88  | _[All My Children](/wiki/All_My_Children \"All My Children\")_ | Robin McCall  | Credited as Deborah Morehart  | [13]  \n1989–90  | _[Days of Our Lives](/wiki/Days_of_Our_Lives \"Days of Our Lives\")_ | [Marina Toscano](/wiki/Marina_Toscano \"Marina Toscano\") |  | [13]  \n1990  | _[Zorro](/wiki/Zorro_\\(1990_TV_series\\) \"Zorro \\(1990 TV series\\)\")_ | Senora Del Reynoso  | Episode: \"Family Business\" |   \n1990–2002,  \n2004,  \n2005–13,  \n2014,  \n2018–  | _[The Bold and the Beautiful](/wiki/The_Bold_and_the_Beautiful \"The Bold and the Beautiful\")_ | [Dr. Taylor Hayes](/wiki/Taylor_Hayes_\\(The_Bold_and_the_Beautiful\\) \"Taylor Hayes \\(The Bold and the Beautiful\\)\") | Series regular (1990–2002;
