The series\nwas created in 2012 by Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor. Published by Night Vale\nPresents since March 15, 2015,[4] the podcast was previously published by\nCommonplace Books.[5] Cecil Gershwin Palmer—the [host](/wiki/Radio_personality\n\"Radio personality\"), [main character](/wiki/Protagonist \"Protagonist\"), and\n[narrator](/wiki/First-person_narrative \"First-person narrative\")—is voiced by\nCecil Baldwin, while secondary characters are sometimes voiced by guest\nstars—such as [Dylan Marron](/wiki/Dylan_Marron \"Dylan Marron\"), who voices\nCarlos. The podcast typically airs on the first and fifteenth of every month,\nand consists of \"news, announcements and advertisements\" from the desert\ntown,[6] located \"somewhere in the [Southwestern United\nStates](/wiki/Southwestern_United_States \"Southwestern United States\").\"[7] In\nan interview with [NPR](/wiki/NPR \"NPR\"), Joseph Fink said that he \"came up\nwith this idea of a town in that desert where all conspiracy theories were\nreal, and we would just go from there with that understood.\"[8]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Production\n  * 2 Guest stars and guest writers\n  * 3 Novels\n    * 3.1 _Welcome to Night Vale_\n    * 3.2 _It Devours!_\n  * 4 Night Vale Presents podcasts\n  * 5 Reception\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 Further reading\n  * 8 External links\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Welcome_to_Night_Vale&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Cecil_Baldwin_%28Welcome_to_Night_Vale%29.jpg/220px-\nCecil_Baldwin_%28Welcome_to_Night_Vale%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cecil_Baldwin_\\(Welcome_to_Night_Vale\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cecil_Baldwin_\\(Welcome_to_Night_Vale\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCecil Baldwin as Cecil in the live episode \"The Investigators\" during the 2015\nUK tour.\n\nSee also: [List of Welcome to Night Vale\nepisodes](/wiki/List_of_Welcome_to_Night_Vale_episodes \"List of Welcome to\nNight Vale episodes\")\n\nEvery episode of the podcast includes a piece of music as \"the weather\", each\nby a different independently published artist.[9] The theme and background\ninstrumental music to the series were created by the musician and composer\nDisparition.[10]\n\nIn October 2013, _Welcome to Night Vale_ began presenting live shows, which\ncontinued into 2014 with a tour of the West Coast.[11] In addition, it was\nannounced during the episode \"The Auction\" that a\n[novel](/wiki/Welcome_to_Night_Vale_\\(novel\\) \"Welcome to Night Vale\n\\(novel\\)\") would be published in 2015. Fink stated that \"it's going to have\nall the characters and weird atmosphere that you want from Night Vale, with a\nbrand new story that explores parts of Night Vale that we just haven't been\nable to get into with the podcast\".[12][13] When the book became available for\npre-order the following March, it became Amazon's #2 title seven months ahead\nof its October release date.[14]\n\n_Welcome to Night Vale_ 's plot consists of longform storytelling.[15]\nIndividual episodes usually function as standalone narratives and only rarely\ncontain significant developments in storyline.[16] The writers employ [running\njokes](/wiki/Running_jokes \"Running jokes\") and [plot arcs](/wiki/Plot_arcs\n\"Plot arcs\"), advanced slowly through the events described in the podcast. For\nexample, The Glow Cloud, one of the series' most iconic characters, hypnotizes\nthe townspeople with its colors and noxious gas, making people chant \"ALL HAIL\nTHE MIGHTY GLOW CLOUD\", and eventually becomes president of Night Vale's\nschool board. Another running joke is that the job with the highest death rate\nis being an intern at the radio station; the only interns and former interns\nwho are currently alive include (in order of appearance) Cecil, Chad Bowinger,\nDana Cardinal, Maureen, Vithya and Kareem.\n\nCharacters and narratives may emerge and develop slowly, while unrelated\nstories may combine to form new plot points.[15][17] Major stories which have\noccurred include the development of a romantic relationship between Cecil and\nCarlos;[18] the stranding of several characters, including Carlos, in a\n\"desert otherworld\";[19] the invasion of Night Vale by the corporation\nStrexCorp, from the rival town of Desert Bluffs, and StrexCorp's eventual\nexpulsion from Night Vale;[20] the 2014 mayoral elections, with subsequent\nterrorist activities by failed mayoral candidates The Faceless Old Woman Who\nSecretly Lives in Your Home and Hiram McDaniels;[21] and the complications\nsurrounding McDaniels' subsequent imprisonment and trial. The series' fourth\nanniversary in June 2016 coincided with a two-part climax to the most recent\nstoryline: the invasion of Night Vale by mysterious strangers, led by a\ndemonic beagle puppy accidentally summoned from Hell by Chad Bowinger, a\nformer radio intern. The early plot point of a miniature city buried under the\ntown's bowling alley resurfaced after this, in addition to the sporadic\nappearance of Huntokar, a deer-headed deity with connections to both the tiny\ncity and Night Vale's unusual nature.\n\n## Guest stars and guest\nwriters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Welcome_to_Night_Vale&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Guest stars and guest writers\")]\n\n  * [Dylan Marron](/wiki/Dylan_Marron \"Dylan Marron\") as Carlos, Cecil's scientist boyfriend and later husband.\n  * [Jasika Nicole](/wiki/Jasika_Nicole \"Jasika Nicole\") as Dana Cardinal, former Night Vale Community Radio Intern and current Mayor of Night Vale.\n  * [Kevin R.

It is told primarily from the viewpoints of Jackie Fierro and\nDiane Crayton, both citizens of Night Vale who have been featured in the\npodcast. Critical reception for the book has been positive.[25][26][27]\n\n### _It\nDevours!_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Welcome_to_Night_Vale&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: It Devours!\")]\n\nIn the March 15, 2017 episode of the podcast, Fink announced a second novel,\ntitled _It Devours!_ , which will deal with Carlos and his team of scientists\ninvestigating the Cult of the Smiling God. It will be released October 17,\n2017.[28]\n\n## Night Vale Presents\npodcasts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Welcome_to_Night_Vale&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Night Vale Presents podcasts\")]\n\nNight Vale Presents, the overall banner for the _Welcome to Night Vale_\npodcast, began launching more serial fiction podcasts in early 2016.\n\nThe first, _[Alice Isn't Dead](/wiki/Alice_Isn%27t_Dead \"Alice Isn't Dead\")_,\nwas written by _Night Vale_ cowriter Joseph Fink, and was performed by [Jasika\nNicole](/wiki/Jasika_Nicole \"Jasika Nicole\"), who played Dana on _Night Vale_.\nThe story was presented as monologues broadcast over a trucker [CB\nradio](/wiki/Citizens_band_radio \"Citizens band radio\"), as a woman drives a\ntruck across America, looking for her missing wife. The first season of 10\nepisodes was released between March and July, 2016, and a second season began\nairing in April 2017.[29]\n\nThe second Night Vale Presents podcast was _Within the Wires_ , written by\n_Night Vale_ cowriter Jeffrey Cranor and Janina Matthewson, who also performed\nthe lead character. This story was told as a series of relaxation tapes\nprepared for a patient in a mysterious medical center known as \"The\nInstitute.\" As the story unfolds, it became clear that the narrator of the\ntapes had a connection to the patient, and may have had a secret agenda. The\nfirst season of 10 episodes was released between June and November, 2016.[30]\n\nA third podcast, _[The Orbiting Human Circus (of the\nAir)](/wiki/The_Orbiting_Human_Circus_\\(of_the_Air\\) \"The Orbiting Human\nCircus \\(of the Air\\)\")_ , was released October 12, 2016. This podcast was\nwritten by and stars musician [Julian Koster](/wiki/Julian_Koster \"Julian\nKoster\").[31]\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Welcome_to_Night_Vale&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nThe show has been described as \"the news from [Lake\nWobegon](/wiki/Lake_Wobegon \"Lake Wobegon\") as seen through the eyes of\n[Stephen King](/wiki/Stephen_King \"Stephen King\")\", and Christopher Wynn of\n_[The Dallas Morning News](/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News \"The Dallas Morning\nNews\")_ characterized it as \"[NPR](/wiki/NPR \"NPR\") meets [The Mothman\nProphecies](/wiki/The_Mothman_Prophecies_\\(film\\) \"The Mothman Prophecies\n\\(film\\)\")\".[6] _[The Daily Dot](/wiki/The_Daily_Dot \"The Daily Dot\")_ 's\nGavia Baker-Whitelaw compared the podcast to being \"caught somewhere between\n[Weird Twitter](/wiki/Weird_Twitter \"Weird Twitter\") and 'Tales of the\nUnexplained'\" and said that it is \"well worth a listen—although possibly not\nafter dark, if you live in a small town yourself\".[32] Colin Griffith of _[The\nA.V. Club](/wiki/The_A.V._Club \"The A.V. Club\")_ said the show is \"really well\ndone, offering a surrealist/absurdist (and occasionally existentialist) take\non [community radio](/wiki/Community_radio \"Community radio\"), with dispatches\nfrom the small, delectably nightmarish desert town of Night Vale\".[33] Writing\nfor _TechGeek_ , Erin Hill considered the uniqueness of the podcast to be \"its\npresentation of what is ordinary\", adding that \"many of the things that Cecil\nreports goes against our idea of normal, but [everything] is presented in a\nmanner that makes it seem mundane\".[34]\n\nIn July 2013, _Welcome to Night Vale_ was ranked second on the top 10 audio\npodcasts list on [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\"), behind radio program _[This\nAmerican Life](/wiki/This_American_Life \"This American Life\")_.[35] During the\nsame month, it surpassed _This American Life_ to become first on the podcasts\nlist, having received 150,000 downloads during a single week.\n\nIn December 2013, _The A.V. Club_ ranked the show 7th on its Best Podcasts of\n2013 list.[36]\n\nCo-producer Jeffrey Cranor attributed this spike in popularity to both\n[Tumblr](/wiki/Tumblr \"Tumblr\") and fans of the television series\n_[Hannibal](/wiki/Hannibal_\\(TV_series\\) \"Hannibal \\(TV series\\)\")_. Max\nSebela, a creative strategist for Tumblr, stated that the fan following began\nto \"spiral out of control\" beginning on July 5, with that week having\n\"20,000-plus posts about 'Night Vale,' with 183,000-plus individual blogs\nparticipating in the conversation, and 680,000-plus notes\".[37] The\n[Twitter](/wiki/Twitter \"Twitter\") account for the podcast has been noted as\nhaving more than 20,000 followers by July 2013.[10]\n\nAccording to [The Daily Dot](/wiki/The_Daily_Dot \"The Daily Dot\"), new\nlisteners primarily come through [fan following](/wiki/Fandom \"Fandom\") and\nword of mouth primarily on [Tumblr](/wiki/Tumblr \"Tumblr\") with [fan\nfiction](/wiki/Fan_fiction \"Fan fiction\") and fan art focusing on the romantic\nrelationship between the show's narrator and scientist Carlos.[38] Fans have\npublished \"fanscripts\", [transcripts](/wiki/Transcription_\\(linguistics\\)\n\"Transcription \\(linguistics\\)\") of the podcast, in order to widen the\naccessibility of _Welcome to Night Vale_.[39]\n\nOn October 15, 2015 producers Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor were interviewed\non _[The Late Show with Stephen\nColbert](/wiki/The_Late_Show_with_Stephen_Colbert \"The Late Show with Stephen\nColbert\")_ , and Cecil Baldwin appeared for a Community Calendar public\nservice message for Night Vale.[40] Mike Rugnetta of [PBS](/wiki/PBS \"PBS\")'s\nweb show Idea Channel compares the show to horror writer [H.P.\nLovecraft](/wiki/H.P._Lovecraft \"H.P. Lovecraft\")'s style of writing about\nfear of what we don't know. He says \"But Night Vale turns Lovecraft's\n'unimaginable terror' into 'drab mundanity'.\"\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Welcome_to_Night_Vale&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"WELCOME TO NIGHT VALE\"](http://www.disparition.info/#!welcome-to-night-vale/c95p). _Disparition_.
