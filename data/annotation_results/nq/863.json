Arthur](/wiki/Chester_A._Arthur \"Chester A.\nArthur\") signed the [Tariff Act of March 3, 1883](/wiki/Tariff_of_1883 \"Tariff\nof 1883\"), requiring a tax to be paid on imported vegetables, but not fruit.\nThe John Nix & Co. company filed a suit against Edward L. Hedden, [Collector\nof the Port of New York](/wiki/Collector_of_the_Port_of_New_York \"Collector of\nthe Port of New York\"), to recover back duties paid under protest. They argued\nagainst the tariff by pointing out that, [botanically](/wiki/Botany \"Botany\"),\na tomato is a fruit due to its seed-bearing structure growing from the\nflowering part of a plant.[3]\n\nAt the trial, the [plaintiffs](/wiki/Plaintiff \"Plaintiff\")' counsel entered\ninto [evidence](/wiki/Evidence_\\(law\\) \"Evidence \\(law\\)\") definitions of the\nwords \"fruit\" and \"vegetables\" from [Webster's\nDictionary](/wiki/Webster%27s_Dictionary \"Webster's Dictionary\"), Worcester's\nDictionary, and the [Imperial\nDictionary](/wiki/Imperial_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language \"Imperial\nDictionary of the English Language\"). They called two\n[witnesses](/wiki/Witness \"Witness\"), who had been in the business of selling\nfruit and vegetables for 30 years, and asked them, after hearing these\ndefinitions, to say whether these words had \"any special meaning in\n[trade](/wiki/Trade \"Trade\") or [commerce](/wiki/Commerce \"Commerce\"),\ndifferent from those read.\"\n\nDuring testimony, one witness testified that in regard to the dictionary\ndefinition:\n\n> [the dictionary] does not classify all things there, but they are correct as\n> far as they go. It does not take all kinds of fruit or vegetables; it takes\n> a portion of them. I think the words 'fruit' and 'vegetable' have the same\n> meaning in trade today that they had on March 1, 1883. I understand that the\n> term 'fruit' is applied in trade only to such plants or parts of plants as\n> contain the seeds. There are more vegetables than those in the enumeration\n> given in Webster's Dictionary under the term 'vegetable,' as 'cabbage,\n> cauliflower, turnips, potatoes, peas, beans, and the like,' probably covered\n> by the words 'and the like'\n\nAnother witness testified that \"I don't think the term 'fruit' or the term\n'vegetables' had, in March 1883, and prior thereto, any special meaning in\ntrade and commerce in this country different from that which I have read here\nfrom the dictionaries.\"[4]\n\nBoth the plaintiffs' counsel and the defendant's counsel made use of the\ndictionaries. The plaintiffs' counsel read in evidence from the same\ndictionaries the definitions of the word tomato, while the defendant's counsel\nthen read in evidence from Webster's Dictionary the definitions of the words\n[pea](/wiki/Pea \"Pea\"), [eggplant](/wiki/Eggplant \"Eggplant\"),\n[cucumber](/wiki/Cucumber \"Cucumber\"), [squash](/wiki/Squash_\\(plant\\) \"Squash\n\\(plant\\)\"), and [pepper](/wiki/Capsicum \"Capsicum\").[5] Countering this, the\nplaintiff then read in evidence from Webster's and Worcester's dictionaries\nthe definitions of [potato](/wiki/Potato \"Potato\"), [turnip](/wiki/Turnip\n\"Turnip\"), [parsnip](/wiki/Parsnip \"Parsnip\"), [cauliflower](/wiki/Cauliflower\n\"Cauliflower\"), [cabbage](/wiki/Cabbage \"Cabbage\"), [carrot](/wiki/Carrot\n\"Carrot\") and [bean](/wiki/Bean \"Bean\").\n\n## The Court's\ndecision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nix_v._Hedden&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: The Court's decision\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Bright_red_tomato_and_cross_section02.jpg/220px-\nBright_red_tomato_and_cross_section02.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bright_red_tomato_and_cross_section02.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bright_red_tomato_and_cross_section02.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBotanically, a tomato is a fruit. However, in common parlance it is seen as a\nvegetable; hence the United States Supreme Court ruled that a tomato is a\nvegetable for the purposes of the customs regulations.\n\nThe court [unanimously](/wiki/Unanimous \"Unanimous\") decided in favor of the\nrespondent and found that the tomato should be classified under the customs\nregulations as a vegetable, based on the ways in which it is used, and the\npopular perception to this end. Justice [Horace Gray](/wiki/Horace_Gray\n\"Horace Gray\"), writing the opinion for the Court, stated that:\n\n> The passages cited from the dictionaries define the word 'fruit' as the seed\n> of plants, or that part of plants which contains the seed, and especially\n> the juicy, pulpy products of certain plants, covering and containing the\n> seed. These definitions have no tendency to show that tomatoes are 'fruit,'\n> as distinguished from 'vegetables,' in common speech, or within the meaning\n> of the [tariff](/wiki/Tariff \"Tariff\") act.\n\nJustice Gray, citing several Supreme Court cases (_[Brown v.\nPiper](/w/index.php?title=Brown_v._Piper&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Brown v. Piper\n\\(page does not exist\\)\"),_ [91 U.S.\n37](http://www.justia.us/us/91/37/case.html),\n[42](http://www.justia.us/us/91/42/case.html)[_[permanent dead\nlink](/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot \"Wikipedia:Link rot\")_], and _[Jones v.\nU.S.](/w/index.php?title=Jones_v._U.S.&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Jones v. U.S.\n\\(page does not exist\\)\"),_ 137 U.S. 202, 216) stated that when words have\nacquired no special meaning in trade or commerce, the ordinary meaning must be\nused by the court. In this case dictionaries cannot be admitted as evidence,\nbut only as aids to the memory and understanding of the court. Gray\nacknowledged that [botanically](/wiki/Botany \"Botany\"), tomatoes are\nclassified as a \"fruit of the [vine](/wiki/Vine \"Vine\")\"; nevertheless, they\nare seen as vegetables because they were usually eaten as a main course\ninstead of being eaten as a [dessert](/wiki/Dessert \"Dessert\"). In making his\ndecision, Justice Gray mentioned another case where it had been claimed that\n[beans](/wiki/Bean \"Bean\") were [seeds](/wiki/Seed \"Seed\") — Justice\n[Bradley](/wiki/Joseph_Philo_Bradley \"Joseph Philo Bradley\"), in _[Robertson\nv. Salomon](/w/index.php?title=Robertson_v._Salomon&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Robertson v. Salomon \\(page does not exist\\)\"),_ 130 U.S. 412, 414, similarly\nfound that though a bean is botanically a seed, in [common\nparlance](/wiki/Idiom \"Idiom\") a bean is seen as a vegetable. While on the\nsubject, Gray clarified the status of the [cucumber](/wiki/Cucumber\n\"Cucumber\"), [squash](/wiki/Squash_\\(plant\\) \"Squash \\(plant\\)\"),\n[pea](/wiki/Pea \"Pea\"), and [bean](/wiki/Bean \"Bean\").\n\n## Subsequent\njurisprudence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nix_v._Hedden&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Subsequent jurisprudence\")]\n\n_Nix_ has been cited in three Supreme Court decisions as a precedent for court\ninterpretation of common meanings, especially dictionary definitions.

Tray-Wrap, Inc. \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\"),_ 917 F.2d 75 (2d Cir. 1990), a case unrelated to _Nix_\naside from the shared focus on tomatoes, a judge wrote the following paragraph\nciting the case:\n\n> In common parlance tomatoes are vegetables, as the Supreme Court observed\n> long ago [see _Nix v. Hedden_ 149 U.S. 304, 307, 13 S.Ct. 881, 882, 37 L.Ed.\n> 745 (1893)], although botanically speaking they are actually a fruit. [_26\n> Encyclopedia Americana_ 832 (Int'l. ed. 1981)].
