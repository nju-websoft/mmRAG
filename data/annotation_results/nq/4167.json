The Gate was designed by [Carl Gotthard\nLanghans](/wiki/Carl_Gotthard_Langhans \"Carl Gotthard Langhans\"), the Court\nSuperintendent of Buildings, and built between 1788 and 1791, replacing the\nearlier simple guardhouses which flanked the original gate in the Customs\nWall. The gate consists of twelve [Doric](/wiki/Doric_order \"Doric order\")\ncolumns, six to each side, forming five passageways. Citizens originally were\nallowed to use only the outermost two on each side. Atop the gate is a\n[Quadriga](/wiki/Quadriga \"Quadriga\"), a chariot drawn by four horses,\nsculpted by [Johann Gottfried Schadow](/wiki/Johann_Gottfried_Schadow \"Johann\nGottfried Schadow\"). The new gate was originally named the Peace Gate (German:\n_Friedenstor_)[2] and the goddess is [Victoria](/wiki/Victoria_\\(mythology\\)\n\"Victoria \\(mythology\\)\"), the goddess of victory.\n\nThe gate's design is based upon the [Propylaea](/wiki/Propylaea \"Propylaea\"),\nthe gateway to the [Acropolis](/wiki/Acropolis \"Acropolis\") in\n[Athens](/wiki/Athens \"Athens\"), Greece, and is consistent with Berlin's\nhistory of architectural [classicism](/wiki/Classicism \"Classicism\") (first,\n[Baroque](/wiki/Baroque \"Baroque\"), and then [neo-Palladian](/wiki/Neo-\nPalladian \"Neo-Palladian\")).

The gate survived World War II and was one of the damaged\nstructures still standing in the Pariser Platz ruins in 1945 (another being\nthe Academy of Fine Arts). The gate was badly damaged with holes in the\ncolumns from bullets and nearby explosions. One horse’s head from the original\nquadriga survived, and is today kept in the collection of the [Märkisches\nMuseum](/wiki/M%C3%A4rkisches_Museum \"Märkisches Museum\").\n\n### Cold War[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Brandenburg_Gate&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Cold War\")]\n\nFollowing Germany's surrender and the end of the war, the governments of [East\nBerlin](/wiki/East_Berlin \"East Berlin\") and [West Berlin](/wiki/West_Berlin\n\"West Berlin\") restored it in a joint effort. The holes were patched, but were\nvisible for many years following the war.\n\nVehicles and pedestrians could travel freely through the gate, located in East\nBerlin, until the [Berlin Wall](/wiki/Berlin_Wall \"Berlin Wall\") was built, 13\nAugust 1961. Brandenburg Gate border crossing was later closed on 14 August\n1961. West Berliners gathered on the western side of the gate to demonstrate\nagainst the Berlin Wall, among them West Berlin's governing Mayor [Willy\nBrandt](/wiki/Willy_Brandt \"Willy Brandt\"), who had spontaneously returned\nfrom a federal election campaigning tour in West Germany earlier on the same\nday.

Thousands of people gathered at the\nwall to celebrate its fall on 9 November 1989. On 22 December 1989, the\nBrandenburg Gate border crossing was reopened when [Helmut\nKohl](/wiki/Helmut_Kohl \"Helmut Kohl\"), the West German chancellor, walked\nthrough to be greeted by [Hans Modrow](/wiki/Hans_Modrow \"Hans Modrow\"), the\nEast German prime minister. Demolition of the rest of the wall around the area\ntook place the following year.\n\nDuring 1990, the quadriga was removed from the gate as part of renovation work\ncarried out by the East German authorities following the fall of the wall in\nNovember 1989. Germany was officially reunified in October 1990.\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate was privately refurbished on 21 December 2000, at a cost\nof six million euros. It was once again opened on 3 October 2002 following\nextensive refurbishment, for the 12th anniversary of [German\nreunification](/wiki/German_reunification \"German reunification\").\n\nBrandenburg Gate became the main venue for the 20th-anniversary celebrations\nof the fall of the Berlin Wall or \"Festival of Freedom\" on the evening of 9\nNovember 2009. The high point of the celebrations was when over 1000\ncolorfully designed foam domino tiles, each over 2.5 m tall, were lined up\nalong the route of the former wall through the city centre. The domino \"wall\"\nwas then toppled in stages converging here.[9]\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate is now again closed to vehicle traffic, and much of\nPariser Platz has been turned into a [cobblestone](/wiki/Cobblestone\n\"Cobblestone\") [pedestrian zone](/wiki/Pedestrian_zone \"Pedestrian zone\"). The\ngate, along with the broad _[Straße des 17.\nJuni](/wiki/Stra%C3%9Fe_des_17._Juni \"Straße des 17.
