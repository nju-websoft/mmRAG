These set of norms has been evolved with the consensus of political\nparties who have consented to abide by the principles embodied in the said\ncode in its letter and spirit.The Model Code of Conduct comes into force\nimmediately on announcement of the election schedule by the commission for the\nneed of ensuring free and fair elections.[1] Much of it is designed to avert\ncommunal clashes and corrupt practices. For example, politicians should not\nmake hate speeches, putting one community against another or make promises\nabout new projects that may sway a voter.\n\nFor the 2014 general election the code came into force on 5 March 2014 when\nthe Commission announced the dates and remains in force till the end of the\n[electoral process](/wiki/Electoral_process \"Electoral process\").\n\n\"The Model Code of Conduct is crucial to make sure a level playing field among\nvarious contenders in the poll fray,\" said the Chief Election Commissioner\n[V.S. Sampath](/w/index.php?title=V.S._Sampath&action=edit&redlink=1 \"V.S.\nSampath \\(page does not exist\\)\") at the press conference.[2]\n\n## Main\npoints[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Election_Commission_of_India%27s_Model_Code_of_Conduct&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Main points\")]\n\nThe main points of the code are:\n\n  1. Government bodies are not to participate in any new recruitment process during the electoral process.\n  2. The contesting candidates and the campaigners must respect the home life of their rivals and should not disturb them by holding road shows or demonstrations in front of their houses. The code tells the candidates to keep it.\n  3. The election campaign rallies and road shows must not hinder the road traffic.\n  4. Candidates are asked to refrain from distributing liquor to voters. It is a widely known fact in India that during election campaigning, liquor may be distributed to the voters.\n  5. The election code in force hinders the government or running party leaders from launching new welfare programmes like construction of roads, provision of drinking water facilities etc. or any ribbon-cutting ceremonies.\n  6. The code instructs that public spaces like meeting grounds, helipads, government guest houses and bungalows should be equally shared among the contesting candidates. These public spaces should not be monopolised by a few candidates.\n  7. Any candidate or political party shall not use any place of worship for election propaganda.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Election_Commission_of_India%27s_Model_Code_of_Conduct&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^**
