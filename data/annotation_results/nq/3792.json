It kept the same format with the same\nhosts.[5] It is the flagship podcast of [Crooked Media](/wiki/Crooked_Media\n\"Crooked Media\"), a progressive media company of which three of the four co-\nhosts (Favreau, Vietor, and Lovett) are founders.[6]\n\nIn an interview with [Kara Swisher](/wiki/Kara_Swisher \"Kara Swisher\"), the\nhosts have stated that rather than continue the previous podcast, the election\nof [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\") as\n[President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\") of the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") spurred\nthem to create a new, progressive media company with a network of podcasts.\nTheir goal is to inform, entertain, and inspire action or activism.[7]\n\nThe hosts went on their first tour in the fall of 2017.[8]\n\n## Content[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pod_Save_America&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Content\")]\n\nThe podcast typically covers recent news items relating to politics\n(specifically the Trump Administration, the U.S. Government, and the\nDemocratic Party), analyzing the possible outcomes and side effects of any\nlegislation or action to the American public. The show often features a guest\nspeaker involved in the show topic, usually an official or politician, either\nactive or retired. Their views run opposite of the Trump administration.\nDuring podcasts, the hosts frequently inform listeners of varying ways to\nresist or to take political action (such as showing up to town halls or to\nconsider running for local offices).[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pod_Save_America&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Gillies, Craille Maguire (January 18, 2017).
