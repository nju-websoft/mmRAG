\"Digital\nelectronics\"), a **binary number** is a [number](/wiki/Number \"Number\")\nexpressed in the **base-2 numeral system** or **binary numeral system** ,\nwhich uses only two symbols: typically [0 (zero)](/wiki/0_\\(number\\) \"0\n\\(number\\)\") and [1 (one)](/wiki/1_\\(number\\) \"1 \\(number\\)\").\n\nThe [base-2](/wiki/Radix \"Radix\") numeral system is a [positional\nnotation](/wiki/Positional_notation \"Positional notation\") with a\n[radix](/wiki/Radix \"Radix\") of 2. Each digit is referred to as a\n[bit](/wiki/Bit \"Bit\"). Because of its straightforward implementation in\n[digital electronic circuitry](/wiki/Digital_electronics \"Digital\nelectronics\") using [logic gates](/wiki/Logic_gate \"Logic gate\"), the binary\nsystem is used by almost all modern [computers and computer-based\ndevices](/wiki/Computer \"Computer\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Egypt\n    * 1.2 China\n    * 1.3 India\n    * 1.4 Other cultures\n    * 1.5 Western predecessors to Leibniz\n    * 1.6 Leibniz and the I Ching\n    * 1.7 Later developments\n  * 2 Representation\n  * 3 Counting in binary\n    * 3.1 Decimal counting\n    * 3.2 Binary counting\n  * 4 Fractions\n  * 5 Binary arithmetic\n    * 5.1 Addition\n      * 5.1.1 Long carry method\n      * 5.1.2 Addition table\n    * 5.2 Subtraction\n    * 5.3 Multiplication\n      * 5.3.1 Multiplication table\n    * 5.4 Division\n    * 5.5 Square root\n  * 6 Bitwise operations\n  * 7 Conversion to and from other numeral systems\n    * 7.1 Decimal\n    * 7.2 Hexadecimal\n    * 7.3 Octal\n  * 8 Representing real numbers\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 References\n  * 11 Further reading\n  * 12 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nThe modern binary number system was studied in Europe in the 16th and 17th\ncenturies by [Thomas Harriot](/wiki/Thomas_Harriot \"Thomas Harriot\"), [Juan\nCaramuel y Lobkowitz](/wiki/Juan_Caramuel_y_Lobkowitz \"Juan Caramuel y\nLobkowitz\"), and [Gottfried Leibniz](/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz \"Gottfried\nLeibniz\"). However, systems related to binary numbers have appeared earlier in\nmultiple cultures including ancient Egypt, China, and India. Leibniz was\nspecifically inspired by the Chinese [I Ching](/wiki/I_Ching \"I Ching\").\n\n### Egypt[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Egypt\")]\n\nSee also: [Ancient Egyptian mathematics](/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_mathematics\n\"Ancient Egyptian mathematics\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Oudjat.SVG/240px-\nOudjat.SVG.png)](/wiki/File:Oudjat.SVG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Oudjat.SVG \"Enlarge\")\n\nArithmetic values represented by parts of the Eye of Horus\n\nThe scribes of ancient Egypt used two different systems for their fractions,\n[Egyptian fractions](/wiki/Egyptian_fraction \"Egyptian fraction\") (not related\nto the binary number system) and [Horus-Eye](/wiki/Eye_of_Horus \"Eye of\nHorus\") fractions (so called because many historians of mathematics believe\nthat the symbols used for this system could be arranged to form the eye of\n[Horus](/wiki/Horus \"Horus\"), although this has been disputed).[1] Horus-Eye\nfractions are a binary numbering system for fractional quantities of grain,\nliquids, or other measures, in which a fraction of a [hekat](/wiki/Hekat\n\"Hekat\") is expressed as a sum of the binary fractions 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16,\n1/32, and 1/64. Early forms of this system can be found in documents from the\n[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt](/wiki/Fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt \"Fifth Dynasty of\nEgypt\"), approximately 2400 BC, and its fully developed hieroglyphic form\ndates to the [Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt](/wiki/Nineteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt\n\"Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt\"), approximately 1200 BC.[2]\n\nThe method used for [ancient Egyptian\nmultiplication](/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication \"Ancient Egyptian\nmultiplication\") is also closely related to binary numbers. In this method,\nmultiplying one number by a second is performed by a sequence of steps in\nwhich a value (initially the first of the two numbers) is either doubled or\nhas the first number added back into it; the order in which these steps are to\nbe performed is given by the binary representation of the second number. This\nmethod can be seen in use, for instance, in the [Rhind Mathematical\nPapyrus](/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus \"Rhind Mathematical Papyrus\"), which\ndates to around 1650 BC.[3]\n\n### China[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: China\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Bagua-name-\nearlier.svg/160px-Bagua-name-earlier.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Bagua-name-\nearlier.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bagua-name-earlier.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDaoist Bagua\n\nThe [I Ching](/wiki/I_Ching \"I Ching\") dates from the 9th century BC in\nChina.[4] The binary notation in the _I Ching_ is used to interpret its\n[quaternary](/wiki/Quaternary_numeral_system \"Quaternary numeral system\")\n[divination](/wiki/I_Ching_divination \"I Ching divination\") technique.[5]\n\nIt is based on taoistic duality of [yin and yang](/wiki/Yin_and_yang \"Yin and\nyang\").[6] [eight trigrams (Bagua)](/wiki/Ba_gua \"Ba gua\") and a set of [64\nhexagrams (\"sixty-four\" gua)](/wiki/Hexagram_\\(I_Ching\\) \"Hexagram \\(I\nChing\\)\"), analogous to the three-bit and six-bit binary numerals, were in use\nat least as early as the [Zhou Dynasty of ancient China](/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty\n\"Zhou Dynasty\").[4]\n\nThe [Song Dynasty](/wiki/Song_Dynasty \"Song Dynasty\") scholar [Shao\nYong](/wiki/Shao_Yong \"Shao Yong\") (1011–1077) rearranged the hexagrams in a\nformat that resembles modern binary numbers, although he did not intend his\narrangement to be used mathematically.[5] Viewing the [least significant\nbit](/wiki/Least_significant_bit \"Least significant bit\") on top of single\nhexagrams in [Shao Yong's square](http://www.biroco.com/yijing/sequence.htm)\nand reading along rows either from bottom right to top left with solid lines\nas 0 and broken lines as 1 or from top left to bottom right with solid lines\nas 1 and broken lines as 0 hexagrams can be interpreted as sequence from 0 to\n63. [7]\n\n### India[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: India\")]\n\nThe Indian scholar [Pingala](/wiki/Pingala \"Pingala\") (c. 2nd century BC)\ndeveloped a binary system for describing [prosody](/wiki/Prosody_\\(poetry\\)\n\"Prosody \\(poetry\\)\").[8][9] He used binary numbers in the form of short and\nlong syllables (the latter equal in length to two short syllables), making it\nsimilar to [Morse code](/wiki/Morse_code \"Morse code\").[10][11] Pingala's\nHindu classic titled [Chandaḥśāstra](/wiki/Chandah-shastra \"Chandah-shastra\")\n(8.23) describes the formation of a matrix in order to give a unique value to\neach meter. The binary representations in Pingala's system increases towards\nthe right, and not to the left like in the binary numbers of the modern,\nWestern [positional notation](/wiki/Positional_notation \"Positional\nnotation\").[12][13]\n\n### Other\ncultures[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Other cultures\")]\n\nThe residents of the island of [Mangareva](/wiki/Mangareva \"Mangareva\") in\n[French Polynesia](/wiki/French_Polynesia \"French Polynesia\") were using a\nhybrid binary-[decimal](/wiki/Decimal \"Decimal\") system before 1450.[14] [Slit\ndrums](/wiki/Slit_drum \"Slit drum\") with binary tones are used to encode\nmessages across Africa and Asia.[6] Sets of binary combinations similar to the\nI Ching have also been used in traditional African divination systems such as\n[Ifá](/wiki/If%C3%A1 \"Ifá\") as well as in [medieval](/wiki/Middle_Ages \"Middle\nAges\") Western [geomancy](/wiki/Geomancy \"Geomancy\"). The base-2 system\nutilized in geomancy had long been widely applied in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n### Western predecessors to\nLeibniz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Western predecessors to Leibniz\")]\n\nIn 1605 [Francis Bacon](/wiki/Francis_Bacon \"Francis Bacon\") discussed a\nsystem whereby letters of the alphabet could be reduced to sequences of binary\ndigits, which could then be encoded as scarcely visible variations in the font\nin any random text.[15] Importantly for the general theory of binary encoding,\nhe added that this method could be used with any objects at all: \"provided\nthose objects be capable of a twofold difference only; as by Bells, by\nTrumpets, by Lights and Torches, by the report of Muskets, and any instruments\nof like nature\".[15] (See [Bacon's cipher](/wiki/Bacon%27s_cipher \"Bacon's\ncipher\").)\n\n[John Napier](/wiki/John_Napier \"John Napier\") in 1617 described a system he\ncalled [location arithmetic](/wiki/Location_arithmetic \"Location arithmetic\")\nfor doing binary calculations using a non-positional representation by\nletters. [Thomas Harriot](/wiki/Thomas_Harriot \"Thomas Harriot\") investigated\nseveral positional numbering systems, including binary, but did not publish\nhis results; they were found later among his papers.[16] Possibly the first\npublication of the system in Europe was by [Juan Caramuel y\nLobkowitz](/wiki/Juan_Caramuel_y_Lobkowitz \"Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz\"), in\n1700.[17]\n\n### Leibniz and the I\nChing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Leibniz and the I Ching\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg/160px-\nGottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGottfried Leibniz\n\nLeibniz studied binary numbering in 1679; his work appears in his article\n_Explication de l 'Arithmétique Binaire_ (published in 1703) The full title of\nLeibniz's article is translated into English as the _\" Explanation of Binary\nArithmetic, which uses only the characters 1 and 0, with some remarks on its\nusefulness, and on the light it throws on the ancient Chinese figures of [Fu\nXi](/wiki/Fu_Xi \"Fu Xi\")\"_.[18] (1703). Leibniz's system uses 0 and 1, like\nthe modern binary numeral system. An example of Leibniz's binary numeral\nsystem is as follows:[18]\n\n    0 0 0 1 numerical value 20\n    0 0 1 0 numerical value 21\n    0 1 0 0 numerical value 22\n    1 0 0 0 numerical value 23\n\nLeibniz interpreted the hexagrams of the I Ching as evidence of binary\ncalculus.[19] As a [Sinophile](/wiki/Sinophile \"Sinophile\"), Leibniz was aware\nof the I Ching, noted with fascination how its hexagrams correspond to the\nbinary numbers from 0 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence\nof major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical\n[mathematics](/wiki/Mathematics \"Mathematics\") he admired.[20] Leibniz was\nfirst introduced to the _[I Ching](/wiki/I_Ching \"I Ching\")_ through his\ncontact with the French Jesuit [Joachim Bouvet](/wiki/Joachim_Bouvet \"Joachim\nBouvet\"), who visited China in 1685 as a missionary. Leibniz saw the _I Ching_\nhexagrams as an affirmation of the\n[universality](/wiki/Universality_\\(philosophy\\) \"Universality\n\\(philosophy\\)\") of his own religious beliefs as a Christian.[19] Binary\nnumerals were central to Leibniz's theology. He believed that binary numbers\nwere symbolic of the Christian idea of _[creatio ex nihilo](/wiki/Ex_nihilo\n\"Ex nihilo\")_ or creation out of nothing.[21]\n\n> [A concept that] is not easy to impart to the pagans, is the creation _ex\n> nihilo_ through God's almighty power. Now one can say that nothing in the\n> world can better present and demonstrate this power than the origin of\n> numbers, as it is presented here through the simple and unadorned\n> presentation of One and Zero or Nothing.\n>\n> — Leibniz's letter to the [Duke of\n> Brunswick](/wiki/Rudolph_Augustus,_Duke_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg \"Rudolph\n> Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg\") attached with the _I Ching_\n> hexagrams[19]\n\n### Later\ndevelopments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Later developments\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/George_Boole_color.jpg/160px-\nGeorge_Boole_color.jpg)](/wiki/File:George_Boole_color.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:George_Boole_color.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGeorge Boole\n\nIn 1854, British mathematician [George Boole](/wiki/George_Boole \"George\nBoole\") published a landmark paper detailing an [algebraic](/wiki/Algebra\n\"Algebra\") system of [logic](/wiki/Logic \"Logic\") that would become known as\n[Boolean algebra](/wiki/Boolean_algebra_\\(logic\\) \"Boolean algebra\n\\(logic\\)\"). His logical calculus was to become instrumental in the design of\ndigital electronic circuitry.[22]\n\nIn 1937, [Claude Shannon](/wiki/Claude_Shannon \"Claude Shannon\") produced his\nmaster's thesis at [MIT](/wiki/MIT \"MIT\") that implemented Boolean algebra and\nbinary arithmetic using electronic relays and switches for the first time in\nhistory. Entitled _[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching\nCircuits](/wiki/A_Symbolic_Analysis_of_Relay_and_Switching_Circuits \"A\nSymbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits\")_ , Shannon's thesis\nessentially founded practical [digital circuit](/wiki/Digital_circuit \"Digital\ncircuit\") design.[23]\n\nIn November 1937, [George Stibitz](/wiki/George_Stibitz \"George Stibitz\"),\nthen working at [Bell Labs](/wiki/Bell_Labs \"Bell Labs\"), completed a relay-\nbased computer he dubbed the \"Model K\" (for \"**K** itchen\", where he had\nassembled it), which calculated using binary addition.[24] Bell Labs\nauthorized a full research program in late 1938 with Stibitz at the helm.\nTheir Complex Number Computer, completed 8 January 1940, was able to calculate\n[complex numbers](/wiki/Complex_numbers \"Complex numbers\"). In a demonstration\nto the [American Mathematical Society](/wiki/American_Mathematical_Society\n\"American Mathematical Society\") conference at [Dartmouth\nCollege](/wiki/Dartmouth_College \"Dartmouth College\") on 11 September 1940,\nStibitz was able to send the Complex Number Calculator remote commands over\ntelephone lines by a [teletype](/wiki/Teletype \"Teletype\"). It was the first\ncomputing machine ever used remotely over a phone line. Some participants of\nthe conference who witnessed the demonstration were [John von\nNeumann](/wiki/John_von_Neumann \"John von Neumann\"), [John\nMauchly](/wiki/John_Mauchly \"John Mauchly\") and [Norbert\nWiener](/wiki/Norbert_Wiener \"Norbert Wiener\"), who wrote about it in his\nmemoirs.[25][26][27]\n\nThe [Z1 computer](/wiki/Z1_\\(computer\\) \"Z1 \\(computer\\)\"), which was designed\nand built by [Konrad Zuse](/wiki/Konrad_Zuse \"Konrad Zuse\") between 1935 and\n1938, used Boolean logic and binary [floating point\nnumbers](/wiki/Floating_point_numbers \"Floating point numbers\").[28]\n\n##\nRepresentation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Representation\")]\n\nAny number can be represented by a sequence of [bits](/wiki/Bit \"Bit\") (binary\ndigits), which in turn may be represented by any mechanism capable of being in\ntwo mutually exclusive states. Any of the following rows of symbols can be\ninterpreted as the binary numeric value of 667:\n\n1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| | ― | | | ― | ― | | | | | ― | | | |  \n☒ | ☐ | ☒ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ | ☒ | ☐ | ☒ | ☒  \ny | n | y | n | n | y | y | n | y | y  \n  \n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Binary_clock.svg/250px-\nBinary_clock.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Binary_clock.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Binary_clock.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [binary clock](/wiki/Binary_clock \"Binary clock\") might use\n[LEDs](/wiki/Light-emitting_diode \"Light-emitting diode\") to express binary\nvalues. In this clock, each column of LEDs shows a [binary-coded\ndecimal](/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal \"Binary-coded decimal\") numeral of the\ntraditional [sexagesimal](/wiki/Sexagesimal \"Sexagesimal\") time.\n\nThe numeric value represented in each case is dependent upon the value\nassigned to each symbol. In a computer, the numeric values may be represented\nby two different [voltages](/wiki/Voltage \"Voltage\"); on a\n[magnetic](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic field\") [disk](/wiki/Disk_storage\n\"Disk storage\"), magnetic [polarities](/wiki/Polarity_\\(physics\\) \"Polarity\n\\(physics\\)\") may be used. A \"positive\", \"[yes](/wiki/Yes_and_no \"Yes and\nno\")\", or \"on\" state is not necessarily equivalent to the numerical value of\none; it depends on the architecture in use.\n\nIn keeping with customary representation of numerals using [Arabic\nnumerals](/wiki/Arabic_numerals \"Arabic numerals\"), binary numbers are\ncommonly written using the symbols **0** and **1**. When written, binary\nnumerals are often subscripted, prefixed or suffixed in order to indicate\ntheir base, or radix. The following notations are equivalent:\n\n  * 100101 binary (explicit statement of format)\n  * 100101b (a suffix indicating binary format; also known as [Intel convention](/wiki/Intel_convention \"Intel convention\")[29][30])\n  * 100101B (a suffix indicating binary format)\n  * bin 100101 (a prefix indicating binary format)\n  * 1001012 (a subscript indicating base-2 (binary) notation)\n  * %100101 (a prefix indicating binary format; also known as [Motorola convention](/wiki/Motorola_convention \"Motorola convention\")[29][30])\n  * 0b100101 (a prefix indicating binary format, common in programming languages)\n  * 6b100101 (a prefix indicating number of bits in binary format, common in programming languages)\n\nWhen spoken, binary numerals are usually read digit-by-digit, in order to\ndistinguish them from decimal numerals. For example, the binary numeral 100 is\npronounced _one zero zero_ , rather than _one hundred_ , to make its binary\nnature explicit, and for purposes of correctness. Since the binary numeral 100\nrepresents the value four, it would be confusing to refer to the numeral as\n_one hundred_ (a word that represents a completely different value, or\namount). Alternatively, the binary numeral 100 can be read out as \"four\" (the\ncorrect _value_), but this does not make its binary nature explicit.\n\n## Counting in\nbinary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Counting in binary\")]\n\nDecimal  \npattern | Binary  \nnumber  \n---|---  \n0 | 0  \n1 | 1  \n2 | 10  \n3 | 11  \n4 | 100  \n5 | 101  \n6 | 110  \n7 | 111  \n8 | 1000  \n9 | 1001  \n10 | 1010  \n11 | 1011  \n12 | 1100  \n13 | 1101  \n14 | 1110  \n15 | 1111  \n  \nCounting in binary is similar to counting in any other number system.\nBeginning with a single digit, counting proceeds through each symbol, in\nincreasing order. Before examining binary counting, it is useful to briefly\ndiscuss the more familiar [decimal](/wiki/Decimal \"Decimal\") counting system\nas a frame of reference.\n\n### Decimal\ncounting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Decimal counting\")]\n\n[Decimal](/wiki/Decimal \"Decimal\") counting uses the ten symbols _0_ through\n_9_. Counting begins with the incremental substitution of the least\nsignificant digit (rightmost digit) which is often called the _first digit_.\nWhen the available symbols for this position are exhausted, the least\nsignificant digit is reset to _0_ , and the next digit of higher significance\n(one position to the left) is incremented (_overflow_), and incremental\nsubstitution of the low-order digit resumes. This method of reset and overflow\nis repeated for each digit of significance. Counting progresses as follows:\n\n    000, 001, 002, ... 007, 008, 009, (rightmost digit is reset to zero, and the digit to its left is incremented)\n    0**1** 0, 011, 012, ...\n     ...\n    090, 091, 092, ... 097, 098, 099, (rightmost two digits are reset to zeroes, and next digit is incremented)\n    **1** 00, 101, 102, ...\n\n### Binary\ncounting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Binary counting\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Binary_counter.gif/220px-\nBinary_counter.gif)](/wiki/File:Binary_counter.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Binary_counter.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nThis counter shows how to count in binary from numbers zero through thirty-\none.\n\nBinary counting follows the same procedure, except that only the two symbols\n_0_ and _1_ are available. Thus, after a digit reaches 1 in binary, an\nincrement resets it to 0 but also causes an increment of the next digit to the\nleft:\n\n    0000,\n    000**1** , (rightmost digit starts over, and next digit is incremented)\n    00**1** 0, 0011, (rightmost two digits start over, and next digit is incremented)\n    0**1** 00, 0101, 0110, 0111, (rightmost three digits start over, and the next digit is incremented)\n    **1** 000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111 ...\n\nIn the binary system, each digit represents an increasing power of 2, with the\nrightmost digit representing 20, the next representing 21, then 22, and so on.\nThe equivalent decimal representation of a binary number is sum of the powers\nof 2 which each digit represents. For example, the binary number 100101 is\nconverted to decimal form as follows:\n\n    1001012 = [ ( **1** ) × 25 ] + [ ( **0** ) × 24 ] + [ ( **0** ) × 23 ] + [ ( **1** ) × 22 ] + [ ( **0** ) × 21 ] + [ ( **1** ) × 20 ]\n\n    1001012 = [ **1** × 32 ] + [ **0** × 16 ] + [ **0** × 8 ] + [ **1** × 4 ] + [ **0** × 2 ] + [ **1** × 1 ]\n\n    **100101 2 = 3710**\n\n## Fractions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Fractions\")]\n\nFractions in binary only terminate if the denominator has\n[2](/wiki/2_\\(number\\) \"2 \\(number\\)\") as the only [prime\nfactor](/wiki/Prime_factor \"Prime factor\"). As a result, 1/10 does not have a\nfinite binary representation, and this causes 10 × 0.1 not to be precisely\nequal to 1 in [floating point arithmetic](/wiki/Floating_point_arithmetic\n\"Floating point arithmetic\"). As an example, to interpret the binary\nexpression for 1/3 = .010101..., this means: 1/3 = 0 × **2 −1** \\+ 1 × **2\n−2** \\+ 0 × **2 −3** \\+ 1 × **2 −4** \\+ ... = 0.3125 + ...

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\ncan be performed on binary numerals.\n\n### Addition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Addition\")]\n\nMain article: [binary adder](/wiki/Binary_adder \"Binary adder\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Half_Adder.svg/200px-\nHalf_Adder.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Half_Adder.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Half_Adder.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [circuit diagram](/wiki/Circuit_diagram \"Circuit diagram\") for a binary\n[half adder](/wiki/Adder_\\(electronics\\) \"Adder \\(electronics\\)\"), which adds\ntwo bits together, producing sum and carry bits.\n\nThe simplest arithmetic operation in binary is addition. Adding two single-\ndigit binary numbers is relatively simple, using a form of carrying:\n\n    0 + 0 → 0\n    0 + 1 → 1\n    1 + 0 → 1\n    1 + 1 → 0, carry 1 (since 1 + 1 = 2 = 0 + (1 × 21) )\n\nAdding two \"1\" digits produces a digit \"0\", while 1 will have to be added to\nthe next column. This is similar to what happens in decimal when certain\nsingle-digit numbers are added together; if the result equals or exceeds the\nvalue of the radix (10), the digit to the left is incremented:\n\n    5 + 5 → 0, carry 1 (since 5 + 5 = 10 = 0 + (1 × 101) )\n    7 + 9 → 6, carry 1 (since 7 + 9 = 16 = 6 + (1 × 101) )\n\nThis is known as _carrying_. When the result of an addition exceeds the value\nof a digit, the procedure is to \"carry\" the excess amount divided by the radix\n(that is, 10/10) to the left, adding it to the next positional value. This is\ncorrect since the next position has a weight that is higher by a factor equal\nto the radix. Carrying works the same way in binary:\n\n    \n    \n      1 1 1 1 1    (carried digits)\n        0 1 1 0 1\n    +   1 0 1 1 1\n    -------------\n    = 1 0 0 1 0 0 = 36\n    \n\nIn this example, two numerals are being added together: 011012 (1310) and\n101112 (2310). The top row shows the carry bits used. Starting in the\nrightmost column, 1 + 1 = 102. The 1 is carried to the left, and the 0 is\nwritten at the bottom of the rightmost column. The second column from the\nright is added: 1 + 0 + 1 = 102 again; the 1 is carried, and 0 is written at\nthe bottom. The third column: 1 + 1 + 1 = 112. This time, a 1 is carried, and\na 1 is written in the bottom row. Proceeding like this gives the final answer\n1001002 (36 decimal).\n\nWhen computers must add two numbers, the rule that: x [xor](/wiki/Exclusive_or\n\"Exclusive or\") y = (x + y) [mod](/wiki/Modulo_operation \"Modulo operation\") 2\nfor any two bits x and y allows for very fast calculation, as well.\n\n#### Long carry\nmethod[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit\nsection: Long carry method\")]\n\nA simplification for many binary addition problems is the [Long Carry\nMethod](/w/index.php?title=Long_Carry_Method&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Long Carry\nMethod \\(page does not exist\\)\") or [Brookhouse Method of Binary\nAddition](/w/index.php?title=Brookhouse_Method_of_Binary_Addition&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Brookhouse Method of Binary Addition \\(page does not exist\\)\"). This method\nis generally useful in any binary addition where one of the numbers contains a\nlong \"string\" of ones. It is based on the simple premise that under the binary\nsystem, when given a \"string\" of digits composed entirely of n ones (_where:_\nn is any integer length), adding 1 will result in the number 1 followed by a\nstring of n zeros. That concept follows, logically, just as in the decimal\nsystem, where adding 1 to a string of n 9s will result in the number 1\nfollowed by a string of n 0s:\n\n    \n    \n         Binary                        Decimal\n        1 1 1 1 1     likewise        9 9 9 9 9\n     +          1                  +          1\n      ———————————                   ———————————\n      1 0 0 0 0 0                   1 0 0 0 0 0\n    \n\nSuch long strings are quite common in the binary system. From that one finds\nthat large binary numbers can be added using two simple steps, without\nexcessive carry operations. In the following example, two numerals are being\nadded together: 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 02 (95810) and 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 12 (69110),\nusing the traditional carry method on the left, and the long carry method on\nthe right:\n\n    \n    \n    Traditional Carry Method                       Long Carry Method\n                                    vs.\n      1 1 1   1 1 1 1 1      (carried digits)   1 ←     1 ←            carry the 1 until it is one digit past the \"string\" below\n        1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0                       ~~1 1 1~~ 0 ~~1 1 1 1 1~~ 0  cross out the \"string\",\n    +   1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1                   +   1 0 ~~1~~ 0 1 1 0 0 ~~1~~ 1  and cross out the digit that was added to it\n    ———————————————————————                    ——————————————————————\n    = 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1                     1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1\n    \n\nThe top row shows the carry bits used. Instead of the standard carry from one\ncolumn to the next, the lowest-ordered \"1\" with a \"1\" in the corresponding\nplace value beneath it may be added and a \"1\" may be carried to one digit past\nthe end of the series. The \"used\" numbers must be crossed off, since they are\nalready added. Other long strings may likewise be cancelled using the same\ntechnique. Then, simply add together any remaining digits normally. Proceeding\nin this manner gives the final answer of 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 12 (164910). In\nour simple example using small numbers, the traditional carry method required\neight carry operations, yet the long carry method required only two,\nrepresenting a substantial reduction of effort.\n\n#### Addition\ntable[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: Addition table\")]\n\n| 0 | 1  \n---|---|---  \n0 | 0 | 1  \n1 | 1 | 10  \n  \nThe binary addition table is similar, but not the same, as the [truth\ntable](/wiki/Logical_disjunction#Truth_table \"Logical disjunction\") of the\n[logical disjunction](/wiki/Logical_disjunction \"Logical disjunction\")\noperation  ∨ {\\displaystyle \\lor } ![\\\\lor\n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab47f6b1f589aedcf14638df1d63049d233d851a).\nThe difference is that  1 {\\displaystyle 1}\n![1](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/92d98b82a3778f043108d4e20960a9193df57cbf)\n∨ {\\displaystyle \\lor } ![\\\\lor\n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab47f6b1f589aedcf14638df1d63049d233d851a)\n1 = 1 {\\displaystyle 1=1}\n![1=1](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25d99fe618d7f25081f5f92fb9556b41e772bddc),\nwhile  1 + 1 = 10 {\\displaystyle 1+1=10}\n![1+1=10](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a9453991f0cea1ee6153ec639dd13cff588a214).\n\n### Subtraction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Subtraction\")]\n\nFurther information: [signed number\nrepresentations](/wiki/Signed_number_representations \"Signed number\nrepresentations\") and [two's complement](/wiki/Two%27s_complement \"Two's\ncomplement\")\n\n[Subtraction](/wiki/Subtraction \"Subtraction\") works in much the same way:\n\n    0 − 0 → 0\n    0 − 1 → 1, borrow 1\n    1 − 0 → 1\n    1 − 1 → 0\n\nSubtracting a \"1\" digit from a \"0\" digit produces the digit \"1\", while 1 will\nhave to be subtracted from the next column. This is known as _borrowing_. The\nprinciple is the same as for carrying. When the result of a subtraction is\nless than 0, the least possible value of a digit, the procedure is to \"borrow\"\nthe deficit divided by the radix (that is, 10/10) from the left, subtracting\nit from the next positional value.\n\n    \n    \n        *   * * *   (starred columns are borrowed from)\n      1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n    −     1 0 1 1 1\n    ----------------\n    = 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\n    \n    \n    \n      *             (starred columns are borrowed from)\n      1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n    -   1 0 1 0 1 1\n    ----------------\n    = 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n    \n\nSubtracting a positive number is equivalent to _adding_ a [negative\nnumber](/wiki/Negative_number \"Negative number\") of equal [absolute\nvalue](/wiki/Absolute_value \"Absolute value\").

Such\nrepresentations eliminate the need for a separate \"subtract\" operation. Using\ntwo's complement notation subtraction can be summarized by the following\nformula:\n\n**A − B = A + not B + 1**\n\n###\nMultiplication[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Multiplication\")]\n\n[Multiplication](/wiki/Multiplication \"Multiplication\") in binary is similar\nto its decimal counterpart. Two numbers A and B can be multiplied by partial\nproducts: for each digit in B, the product of that digit in A is calculated\nand written on a new line, shifted leftward so that its rightmost digit lines\nup with the digit in B that was used. The sum of all these partial products\ngives the final result.\n\nSince there are only two digits in binary, there are only two possible\noutcomes of each partial multiplication:\n\n  * If the digit in B is 0, the partial product is also 0\n  * If the digit in B is 1, the partial product is equal to A\n\nFor example, the binary numbers 1011 and 1010 are multiplied as follows:\n\n    \n    \n               1 0 1 1   (A)\n             × 1 0 1 0   (B)\n             ---------\n               0 0 0 0   ← Corresponds to the rightmost 'zero' in B\n       +     1 0 1 1     ← Corresponds to the next 'one' in B\n       +   0 0 0 0\n       + 1 0 1 1\n       ---------------\n       = 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n    \n\nBinary numbers can also be multiplied with bits after a [binary\npoint](/wiki/Binary_point \"Binary point\"):\n\n    \n    \n                   1 0 1 . 1 0 1     A (5.625 in decimal)\n                 × 1 1 0 . 0 1       B (6.25  in decimal)\n                 -------------------\n                       1 . 0 1 1 0 1   ← Corresponds to a 'one' in B\n         +           0 0 . 0 0 0 0     ← Corresponds to a 'zero' in B\n         +         0 0 0 . 0 0 0\n         +       1 0 1 1 . 0 1\n         +     1 0 1 1 0 . 1\n         ---------------------------\n         =   1 0 0 0 1 1 . 0 0 1 0 1  (35.15625 in decimal)\n    \n\nSee also [Booth's multiplication\nalgorithm](/wiki/Booth%27s_multiplication_algorithm \"Booth's multiplication\nalgorithm\").\n\n#### Multiplication\ntable[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit\nsection: Multiplication table\")]\n\n| 0 | 1  \n---|---|---  \n0 | 0 | 0  \n1 | 0 | 1  \n  \nThe binary multiplication table is the same as the [truth\ntable](/wiki/Logical_conjunction#Truth_table \"Logical conjunction\") of the\n[logical conjunction](/wiki/Logical_conjunction \"Logical conjunction\")\noperation  ∧ {\\displaystyle \\land } ![\\\\land\n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6823e5a222eb3ca49672818ac3d13ec607052c4).\n\n### Division[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Division\")]\n\n    \n\nSee also: [Division algorithm](/wiki/Division_algorithm \"Division algorithm\")\n\n[Long division](/wiki/Long_division \"Long division\") in binary is again\nsimilar to its decimal counterpart.\n\nIn the example below, the [divisor](/wiki/Divisor \"Divisor\") is 1012, or 5\ndecimal, while the [dividend](/wiki/Division_\\(mathematics\\) \"Division\n\\(mathematics\\)\") is 110112, or 27 decimal.

When a string of\nbinary symbols is manipulated in this way, it is called a [bitwise\noperation](/wiki/Bitwise_operation \"Bitwise operation\"); the logical operators\n[AND](/wiki/Logical_conjunction \"Logical conjunction\"),\n[OR](/wiki/Logical_disjunction \"Logical disjunction\"), and\n[XOR](/wiki/Exclusive_disjunction \"Exclusive disjunction\") may be performed on\ncorresponding bits in two binary numerals provided as input. The logical\n[NOT](/wiki/Negation \"Negation\") operation may be performed on individual bits\nin a single binary numeral provided as input. Sometimes, such operations may\nbe used as arithmetic short-cuts, and may have other computational benefits as\nwell. For example, an [arithmetic shift](/wiki/Arithmetic_shift \"Arithmetic\nshift\") left of a binary number is the equivalent of multiplication by a\n(positive, integral) power of 2.\n\n## Conversion to and from other numeral\nsystems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit\nsection: Conversion to and from other numeral systems\")]\n\n### Decimal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Decimal\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Decimal_to_Binary_Conversion.gif)](/wiki/File:Decimal_to_Binary_Conversion.gif)\n\nConversion of (357)10 to binary notation results in (101100101)\n\nTo convert from a base-10 integer to its base-2 (binary) equivalent, the\nnumber is [divided by two](/wiki/Division_by_two \"Division by two\"). The\nremainder is the [least-significant bit](/wiki/Least-significant_bit \"Least-\nsignificant bit\"). The quotient is again divided by two; its remainder becomes\nthe next least significant bit. This process repeats until a quotient of one\nis reached. The sequence of remainders (including the final quotient of one)\nforms the binary value, as each remainder must be either zero or one when\ndividing by two. For example, (357)10 is expressed as (101100101)2.[31]\n\nConversion from base-2 to base-10 simply inverts the preceding algorithm. The\nbits of the binary number are used one by one, starting with the most\nsignificant (leftmost) bit. Beginning with the value 0, the prior value is\ndoubled, and the next bit is then added to produce the next value. This can be\norganized in a multi-column table. For example, to convert 100101011012 to\ndecimal:\n\n     Prior value | × 2 + | Next bit | Next value  \n---|---|---|---  \n0 | × 2 + | **1** | = 1  \n1 | × 2 + | **0** | = 2  \n2 | × 2 + | **0** | = 4  \n4 | × 2 + | **1** | = 9  \n9 | × 2 + | **0** | = 18  \n18 | × 2 + | **1** | = 37  \n37 | × 2 + | **0** | = 74  \n74 | × 2 + | **1** | = 149  \n149 | × 2 + | **1** | = 299  \n299 | × 2 + | **0** | = 598  \n598 | × 2 + | **1** | = **1197**  \n  \nThe result is 119710. Note that the first Prior Value of 0 is simply an\ninitial decimal value. This method is an application of the [Horner\nscheme](/wiki/Horner_scheme \"Horner scheme\").\n\nBinary  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nDecimal  | 1×210 + | 0×29 + | 0×28 + | 1×27 + | 0×26 + | 1×25 + | 0×24 + | 1×23 + | 1×22 + | 0×21 + | 1×20 = | 1197  \n  \nThe fractional parts of a number are converted with similar methods. They are\nagain based on the equivalence of shifting with doubling or halving.\n\nIn a fractional binary number such as 0.110101101012, the first digit is  1 2\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{matrix}{\\frac {1}{2}}\\end{matrix}}}\n![{\\\\begin{matrix}{\\\\frac\n{1}{2}}\\\\end{matrix}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1040f72e4158f6fdd3b0d4650280d21acb841d9d),\nthe second  ( 1 2 ) 2 = 1 4 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{matrix}({\\frac\n{1}{2}})^{2}={\\frac {1}{4}}\\end{matrix}}} ![{\\\\begin{matrix}\\({\\\\frac\n{1}{2}}\\)^{2}={\\\\frac\n{1}{4}}\\\\end{matrix}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5768fe44cb3ce1188c943c438ed19d7ac695b3b8),\netc. So if there is a 1 in the first place after the decimal, then the number\nis at least  1 2 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{matrix}{\\frac {1}{2}}\\end{matrix}}}\n![{\\\\begin{matrix}{\\\\frac\n{1}{2}}\\\\end{matrix}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1040f72e4158f6fdd3b0d4650280d21acb841d9d),\nand vice versa. Double that number is at least 1. This suggests the algorithm:\nRepeatedly double the number to be converted, record if the result is at least\n1, and then throw away the integer part.\n\nFor example,  ( 1 3 ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{matrix}({\\frac\n{1}{3}})\\end{matrix}}} ![{\\\\begin{matrix}\\({\\\\frac\n{1}{3}}\\)\\\\end{matrix}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4369dfea176341336f6c89fb365019a8b281b7f8)10,\nin binary, is:\n\n     Converting | Result  \n---|---  \n1 3 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{matrix}{\\frac {1}{3}}\\end{matrix}}} ![{\\\\begin{matrix}{\\\\frac {1}{3}}\\\\end{matrix}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06ebda3a25ef5a216874ff949dffbe9a90d93c60) | 0.  \n1 3 × 2 = 2 3 < 1 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{matrix}{\\frac {1}{3}}\\times 2={\\frac {2}{3}}<1\\end{matrix}}} ![{\\\\begin{matrix}{\\\\frac {1}{3}}\\\\times 2={\\\\frac {2}{3}}<1\\\\end{matrix}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/28c62f9acef49f2832ec82381e954fabffbe93a8) | 0.0  \n2 3 × 2 = 1 1 3 ≥ 1 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{matrix}{\\frac {2}{3}}\\times 2=1{\\frac {1}{3}}\\geq 1\\end{matrix}}} ![{\\\\begin{matrix}{\\\\frac {2}{3}}\\\\times 2=1{\\\\frac {1}{3}}\\\\geq 1\\\\end{matrix}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3ad33e9d2b5397aef6310856a1d4ec9897a650e) | 0.01  \n1 3 × 2 = 2 3 < 1 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{matrix}{\\frac {1}{3}}\\times 2={\\frac {2}{3}}<1\\end{matrix}}} ![{\\\\begin{matrix}{\\\\frac {1}{3}}\\\\times 2={\\\\frac {2}{3}}<1\\\\end{matrix}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/28c62f9acef49f2832ec82381e954fabffbe93a8) | 0.010  \n2 3 × 2 = 1 1 3 ≥ 1 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{matrix}{\\frac {2}{3}}\\times 2=1{\\frac {1}{3}}\\geq 1\\end{matrix}}} ![{\\\\begin{matrix}{\\\\frac {2}{3}}\\\\times 2=1{\\\\frac {1}{3}}\\\\geq 1\\\\end{matrix}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3ad33e9d2b5397aef6310856a1d4ec9897a650e) | 0.0101  \n  \nThus the repeating decimal fraction 0.3... is equivalent to the repeating\nbinary fraction 0.01... .\n\nOr for example, 0.110, in binary, is:\n\n     Converting | Result  \n---|---  \n**0.1** | 0.  \n0.1 × 2 = **0.2** < 1 | 0.0  \n0.2 × 2 = **0.4** < 1 | 0.00  \n0.4 × 2 = **0.8** < 1 | 0.000  \n0.8 × 2 = **1.6** ≥ 1 | 0.0001  \n0.6 × 2 = **1.2** ≥ 1 | 0.00011  \n0.2 × 2 = **0.4** < 1 | 0.000110  \n0.4 × 2 = **0.8** < 1 | 0.0001100  \n0.8 × 2 = **1.6** ≥ 1 | 0.00011001  \n0.6 × 2 = **1.2** ≥ 1 | 0.000110011  \n0.2 × 2 = **0.4** < 1 | 0.0001100110  \n  \nThis is also a repeating binary fraction 0.00011... . It may come as a\nsurprise that terminating decimal fractions can have repeating expansions in\nbinary. It is for this reason that many are surprised to discover that 0.1 +\n... + 0.1, (10 additions) differs from 1 in [floating point\narithmetic](/wiki/Floating_point_arithmetic \"Floating point arithmetic\"). In\nfact, the only binary fractions with terminating expansions are of the form of\nan integer divided by a power of 2, which 1/10 is not.\n\nThe final conversion is from binary to decimal fractions. The only difficulty\narises with repeating fractions, but otherwise the method is to shift the\nfraction to an integer, convert it as above, and then divide by the\nappropriate power of two in the decimal base.

A simple divide-and-conquer algorithm is more effective\nasymptotically: given a binary number, it is divided by 10 _k_ , where _k_ is\nchosen so that the quotient roughly equals the remainder; then each of these\npieces is converted to decimal and the two are\n[concatenated](/wiki/Concatenation \"Concatenation\"). Given a decimal number,\nit can be split into two pieces of about the same size, each of which is\nconverted to binary, whereupon the first converted piece is multiplied by 10\n_k_ and added to the second converted piece, where _k_ is the number of\ndecimal digits in the second, least-significant piece before conversion.\n\n### Hexadecimal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Binary_number&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Hexadecimal\")]\n\nMain article: [Hexadecimal](/wiki/Hexadecimal \"Hexadecimal\")\n\n**0** hex | = | [0dec](/wiki/0_\\(number\\) \"0 \\(number\\)\") | = | 0oct |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**1** hex | = | [1dec](/wiki/1_\\(number\\) \"1 \\(number\\)\") | = | 1oct | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1  \n**2** hex | = | [2dec](/wiki/2_\\(number\\) \"2 \\(number\\)\") | = | 2oct | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0  \n**3** hex | = | [3dec](/wiki/3_\\(number\\) \"3 \\(number\\)\") | = | 3oct | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1  \n**4** hex | = | [4dec](/wiki/4_\\(number\\) \"4 \\(number\\)\") | = | 4oct | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0  \n**5** hex | = | [5dec](/wiki/5_\\(number\\) \"5 \\(number\\)\") | = | 5oct | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1  \n**6** hex | = | [6dec](/wiki/6_\\(number\\) \"6 \\(number\\)\") | = | 6oct | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0  \n**7** hex | = | [7dec](/wiki/7_\\(number\\) \"7 \\(number\\)\") | = | 7oct | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1  \n**8** hex | = | [8dec](/wiki/8_\\(number\\) \"8 \\(number\\)\") | = | 10oct | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n**9** hex | = | [9dec](/wiki/9_\\(number\\) \"9 \\(number\\)\") | = | 11oct | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1  \n**A** hex | = | [10dec](/wiki/10_\\(number\\) \"10 \\(number\\)\") | = | 12oct | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0  \n**B** hex | = | [11dec](/wiki/11_\\(number\\) \"11 \\(number\\)\") | = | 13oct | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1  \n**C** hex | = | [12dec](/wiki/12_\\(number\\) \"12 \\(number\\)\") | = | 14oct | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0  \n**D** hex | = | [13dec](/wiki/13_\\(number\\) \"13 \\(number\\)\") | = | 15oct | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1  \n**E** hex | = | [14dec](/wiki/14_\\(number\\) \"14 \\(number\\)\") | = | 16oct | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0  \n**F** hex | = | [15dec](/wiki/15_\\(number\\) \"15 \\(number\\)\") | = | 17oct | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1  \n  \nBinary may be converted to and from hexadecimal more easily.

For instance\n\n     1 10 3 10 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1_{10}}{3_{10}}}} ![{\\\\frac {1_{10}}{3_{10}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5b2b8fcc03485442524b5e7322976f60a18ab8c) =  1 2 11 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1_{2}}{11_{2}}}} ![{\\\\frac {1_{2}}{11_{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b88a9a4451f014fb2f6cf9d0c441a335a62c89d4) = 0.0101010101…2\n\n     12 10 17 10 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {12_{10}}{17_{10}}}} ![{\\\\frac {12_{10}}{17_{10}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e89a411e73c8bc989cf0a9e8c694912476256163) =  1100 2 10001 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1100_{2}}{10001_{2}}}} ![{\\\\frac {1100_{2}}{10001_{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/28c5c73732b1fba0c97758bc526f3180b2110f56) = 0.10110100 10110100 10110100...2\n\nThe phenomenon that the binary representation of any rational is either\nterminating or recurring also occurs in other radix-based numeral systems.\nSee, for instance, the explanation in [decimal](/wiki/Decimal \"Decimal\").\nAnother similarity is the existence of alternative representations for any\nterminating representation, relying on the fact that 0.111111… is the sum of\nthe [geometric series](/wiki/Geometric_series \"Geometric series\") 2−1 \\+ 2−2\n\\+ 2−3 \\+ ... which is 1.\n\nBinary numerals which neither terminate nor recur represent [irrational\nnumbers](/wiki/Irrational_number \"Irrational number\"). For instance,\n\n  * 0.10100100010000100000100… does have a pattern, but it is not a fixed-length recurring pattern, so the number is irrational\n  * 1.0110101000001001111001100110011111110… is the binary representation of  2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}} ![{\\\\sqrt {2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff), the [square root of 2](/wiki/Square_root_of_2 \"Square root of 2\"), another irrational. It has no discernible pattern.
