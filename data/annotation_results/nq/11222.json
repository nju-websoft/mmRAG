M.\nBeenamol](/wiki/K._M._Beenamol \"K. M. Beenamol\") and shooter [Anjali\nBhagwat](/wiki/Anjali_Bhagwat \"Anjali Bhagwat\"). The government rejected the\nrecommendations and asked the committee to cut down the list to comply with\nthe award guidelines, where only one sportsperson for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel\nRatna Award and fifteen sportspersons along with one disabled athlete for the\nArjuna Awards could be recommended each year.[30] The committee revised the\nlist to recommend Beenamol for the award over Bhagwat but also put a request\n\"to consider everyone\".[31] The decision spurred criticism for ignoring the\nachievements of the shooter and Bhagwat and the [National Rifle Association of\nIndia](/wiki/National_Rifle_Association_of_India \"National Rifle Association\nof India\") expressed their \"disappointment\" with the decision.[32] Later, the\ngovernment accepted all the recommendations \"as an exception\" and jointly\nawarded Beenamol and Bhagwat for the year 2002.[33]\n\nIn August 2013, the selection committee headed by [Michael\nFerreira](/wiki/Michael_Ferreira \"Michael Ferreira\") recommended [sport\nshooter](/wiki/Shooting_sport \"Shooting sport\") [Ronjan\nSodhi](/wiki/Ronjan_Sodhi \"Ronjan Sodhi\") for the award, with some committee\nmembers questioning the process of selection.[34] A committee member noted\nthat [discus thrower](/wiki/Discus_throw \"Discus throw\") [Krishna\nPoonia](/wiki/Krishna_Poonia \"Krishna Poonia\"), and Paralympic athlete [H. N.\nGirisha](/wiki/Girisha_Nagarajegowda \"Girisha Nagarajegowda\") were shortlisted\nand Sodhi was not the initial choice. However, Girisha's name was removed, and\nthe final voting was done between Sodhi and Poonia.[35] Poonia was accused of\nlobbying for the award by one of the committee member Anjali Bhagwat,[36] but\nthe accused met the then Union Sports Minister [Jitendra\nSingh](/wiki/Jitendra_Singh_\\(Congress_politician\\) \"Jitendra Singh \\(Congress\npolitician\\)\") to promote her case and also rubbished the lobbying\nallegations.[37][38] The Ministry conducted a separate enquiry by Secretary of\nDepartment of Sports and decided not to increase the number of awards \"to\nmaintain the stature of the awards\".[37]\n\nFollowing an announcement, in August 2015, that tennis player [Sania\nMirza](/wiki/Sania_Mirza \"Sania Mirza\") was to be awarded, a [Public-Interest\nLitigation](/wiki/Public_interest_law \"Public interest law\") was filed in the\n[Karnataka High Court](/wiki/Karnataka_High_Court \"Karnataka High Court\"). The\npetitioner, Paralympic athlete H. N. Girisha, mentioned that his performance\nwas ignored by the committee.[39] Girisha claimed to be a top contender for\nthe award with 90 points, owing to his silver medal winning act at the [2012\nSummer Paralympics](/wiki/2012_Summer_Paralympics \"2012 Summer Paralympics\")\nin the [Men's High Jump F42\nevent](/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2012_Summer_Paralympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_high_jump\n\"Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics – Men's high jump\").[40] The\npetition mentioned that the points for Mirza's [Grand\nSlam](/wiki/Grand_Slam_\\(tennis\\) \"Grand Slam \\(tennis\\)\") titles from 2011\nuntil 2015 should not be counted as the events were not a part of the list of\nsports events to be considered for the performance evaluation.[e] The court\nwithheld the conferment and sought replies from the Ministry about the\nselection process. The Ministry nevertheless presented the award to Mirza on\n29 August 2015 amidst the case processing.[2]\n\n## Explanatory\nnotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rajiv_Gandhi_Khel_Ratna&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Explanatory notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** The cash prize was revised from ₹1 lakh (US$1,600) to ₹3 lakh (US$4,700) in 2000,[4][5] to ₹5 lakh (US$7,800) in 2002,[6] and to ₹7.5 lakh (US$12,000) in 2009.[7]\n  2. **Jump up ^** For cricket, there is no National Sports Federation recognised by the Government.[1]\n  3. **Jump up ^** A World Championship/World Cup is generally organised every four years.
