The two winners then met in a best-of-three final in [Kalamazoo, Michigan](/wiki/Kalamazoo,_Michigan \"Kalamazoo, Michigan\").\n  * 1948 – Similar to 1947, but the two, four-team playoffs were changed to double-elimination tournaments. Again in the finals, the two winners met in a best-of-three format in Kalamazoo.\n  * 1949 – The final was expanded to a four-team, double-elimination format and the site changed to Wichita, Kansas. Eight teams began the playoffs with the four finalists decided by a best-of-three district format.\n  * 1950–1987 – An eight-team, double-elimination format for the College World Series coincided with the move to Omaha in 1950. From 1950 to 1953, a baseball committee chose one team from each of the eight NCAA districts to compete at the CWS, which constituted the entire Division I tournament, as there were no preliminary rounds. (In 1948 and 1949, a selection committee in each of the eight districts chose its district representative based on the committee's own criteria, which might or might not include committee selections, conference champions, and district playoffs.) Through 1987 the College World Series was a pure double-elimination event. That ended with the [1987 College World Series](/wiki/1987_College_World_Series \"1987 College World Series\"). In 1954, the Division I tournament began having preliminary rounds to determine the eight CWS teams. From 1954 to 1975, the number of teams in the first round of the overall tournament ranged from 21 to 32. The number of first-round teams was increased to 34 in 1976, 36 in 1982, 38 in 1985, 40 in 1986, and 48 in 1987.\n  * 1988–1998 – The format was changed beginning with the [1988 College World Series](/wiki/1988_College_World_Series \"1988 College World Series\"), when the tournament was divided into 2 four-team double-elimination brackets, with the survivors of each bracket playing in a single championship game. The single-game championship was designed for network television, with the final game on [CBS](/wiki/CBS_Sports \"CBS Sports\") on a Saturday afternoon.\n\n    \n\n    Before expanding to 64 teams in 1999, the 1998 Division I tournament began with 48 teams, split into 8 six-team regionals. The 8 regional winners advanced to the College World Series. The regionals were a test of endurance, as teams had to win at least four games over four days, sometimes five if a team dropped into the loser's bracket, placing a premium on pitching. In the last two years of the six-team regional format, the eventual CWS champion – [LSU](/wiki/LSU_Tigers_baseball \"LSU Tigers baseball\") in [1997](/wiki/1997_College_World_Series \"1997 College World Series\") and [Southern California](/wiki/USC_Trojans_baseball \"USC Trojans baseball\") in [1998](/wiki/1998_College_World_Series \"1998 College World Series\") – had to battle back from the loser's bracket in the regional to advance to Omaha.\n\n  * 1999–2002 – With some 293 Division I teams playing, the NCAA expanded the [overall tournament](/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Baseball_Championship \"NCAA Division I Baseball Championship\") to a 64-team Regional field in 1999—with 8 National Seed teams (the top 8 seeds)—divided into 16 four-team regionals (each region seeded 1 to 4). The winners of the 16 \"Regionals\" advance to a second round, consisting of 8 two-team, best-of-three-format \"Super Regionals\". (The National Seed teams that win their regional bracket are placed in different Super Regionals, so that no National Seed teams meet each other in a Super Regional.) The 8 Super Regional winners advance to the CWS in Omaha. While the CWS format remained the same, the expanded field meant that the eight CWS teams now are determined by the second-round Super Regionals. The 64-team bracket is set at the beginning of the championship and teams are not reseeded for the CWS. Since the [1999 College World Series](/wiki/1999_College_World_Series \"1999 College World Series\"), the four-team brackets in the CWS have been determined by the results of super-regional play, much like the [NCAA basketball tournament](/wiki/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship \"NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship\"). Prior to 1999, the four-team brackets were determined by the regional tournaments.\n  * 2003–present – The championship final became a best-of-three series between the 2 four-team bracket winners, with games scheduled for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday evenings. In the results shown below, **Score** indicates the score of the championship game(s) only. In 2008, the start of the CWS was moved back one day, and an extra day of rest was added in between bracket play and the championship series.\n\n## Division I champions by\nyear[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_World_Series&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Division I champions by year\")]\n\nYear | Champion | Coach | Score | Runner-Up | Most Outstanding Player  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n[1947](/wiki/1947_College_World_Series \"1947 College World Series\") | [California](/wiki/1947_California_Golden_Bears_baseball_team \"1947 California Golden Bears baseball team\") | [Clint Evans](/wiki/Clint_Evans \"Clint Evans\") | 17–8, 8–7 | [Yale](/wiki/1947_Yale_Bulldogs_baseball_team \"1947 Yale Bulldogs baseball team\") |   \n[1948](/wiki/1948_College_World_Series \"1948 College World Series\") | [Southern California](/wiki/1948_USC_Trojans_baseball_team \"1948 USC Trojans baseball team\") | [Sam Barry](/wiki/Sam_Barry \"Sam Barry\") | 3–1, 3–8, 9–2 | [Yale](/wiki/1948_Yale_Bulldogs_baseball_team \"1948 Yale Bulldogs baseball team\") |   \n[1949](/wiki/1949_College_World_Series \"1949 College World Series\") | [Texas](/wiki/1949_Texas_Longhorns_baseball_team \"1949 Texas Longhorns baseball team\") | [Bibb Falk](/wiki/Bibb_Falk \"Bibb Falk\") | 10–3 | [Wake Forest](/wiki/Wake_Forest_Demon_Deacons_baseball \"Wake Forest Demon Deacons baseball\") | [Tom Hamilton](/wiki/Tom_Hamilton_\\(baseball\\) \"Tom Hamilton \\(baseball\\)\"), Texas  \n[1950](/wiki/1950_College_World_Series \"1950 College World Series\") | [Texas](/wiki/1950_Texas_Longhorns_baseball_team \"1950 Texas Longhorns baseball team\") | [Bibb Falk](/wiki/Bibb_Falk \"Bibb Falk\") | 3–0 | [Washington State](/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars_baseball \"Washington State Cougars baseball\") | [Ray VanCleef](/wiki/Ray_VanCleef \"Ray VanCleef\"), [Rutgers](/wiki/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights_baseball \"Rutgers Scarlet Knights baseball\")  \n[1951](/wiki/1951_College_World_Series \"1951 College World Series\") | [Oklahoma](/wiki/1951_Oklahoma_Sooners_baseball_team \"1951 Oklahoma Sooners baseball team\") | [Jack Baer](/wiki/Jack_Baer \"Jack Baer\") | 3–2 | [Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee_Volunteers_baseball \"Tennessee Volunteers baseball\") | [Sidney Hatfield](/wiki/Sidney_Hatfield \"Sidney Hatfield\"), Tennessee  \n[1952](/wiki/1952_College_World_Series \"1952 College World Series\") | [Holy Cross](/wiki/1952_Holy_Cross_Crusaders_baseball_team \"1952 Holy Cross Crusaders baseball team\") | [Jack Barry](/wiki/Jack_Barry_\\(baseball\\) \"Jack Barry \\(baseball\\)\") | 8–4 | [Missouri](/wiki/1952_Missouri_Tigers_baseball_team \"1952 Missouri Tigers baseball team\") | [James O'Neill](/wiki/James_O%27Neill_\\(baseball\\) \"James O'Neill \\(baseball\\)\"), Holy Cross  \n[1953](/wiki/1953_College_World_Series \"1953 College World Series\") | [Michigan](/wiki/1953_Michigan_Wolverines_baseball_team \"1953 Michigan Wolverines baseball team\") | [Ray Fisher](/wiki/Ray_Fisher \"Ray Fisher\") | 7–5 | [Texas](/wiki/1953_Texas_Longhorns_baseball_team \"1953 Texas Longhorns baseball team\") | [J.L.
