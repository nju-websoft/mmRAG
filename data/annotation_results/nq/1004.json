Once a classical piano child\nprodigy under the tutelage of her father, Steve Miller ([Greg\nKinnear](/wiki/Greg_Kinnear \"Greg Kinnear\")), Ronnie now ignores the\ninstrument and has not spoken with her father since he left. While [Juilliard\nSchool](/wiki/Juilliard_School \"Juilliard School\") has been interested in her\nsince she was young, Ronnie refuses to attend.\n\nSteve now has the chance to reconnect with his estranged daughter when her\nmother, Kim Miller ([Kelly Preston](/wiki/Kelly_Preston \"Kelly Preston\"))\nsends the rebellious teen and her younger brother, Jonah ([Bobby\nColeman](/wiki/Bobby_Coleman \"Bobby Coleman\")), to spend the summer with him.\nSteve, a former Juilliard School professor and concert pianist, lives a quiet\nlife in Wrightsville Beach, the small beach town in North Carolina where he\ngrew up, working on a [stained glass](/wiki/Stained_glass \"Stained glass\")\n[window](/wiki/Window \"Window\") for the local church to replace the one the\nchurch lost in a fire. According to the locals, it was Steve who had\n(accidentally) set fire to the church one night.\n\nAfter arrival, Ronnie becomes miserable, defiant, and defensive toward all\nthose around her, including handsome, popular Will Blakelee ([Liam\nHemsworth](/wiki/Liam_Hemsworth \"Liam Hemsworth\")) whose introduction involved\ncrashing into her during a volleyball match, and accidentally spilling\nRonnie's strawberry shake on her. She shrugs him off and meets Blaze, an\noutcast who lives with her boyfriend Marcus. While at a beach campfire, Marcus\nhits on Ronnie and Blaze mistakes this for Ronnie flirting with him. Angered\nby this, Blaze later frames Ronnie for shoplifting, causing her arrest. Later\non, Ronnie discovers a [Loggerhead Sea Turtle](/wiki/Loggerhead_Sea_Turtle\n\"Loggerhead Sea Turtle\") nest at the beach by her house and while protecting\nit, she meets Will again on his volunteer work for the aquarium. After a night\nof staying up to defend the turtle eggs from predators with Will, she\ndiscovers he is deeper than she expected, and begins to develop feelings for\nhim.\n\nThe next day, Will takes Ronnie to where he works to show her the aquarium.\nAfter they leave to the beach, Ashley shows up and tells Ronnie about Will's\npast relationships and how taking them to see the aquarium was routine of his,\nmaking Ronnie doubtful of her feelings toward him. Will finds her at the\nturtle's nest and they have an argument about his past relationships. When\nRonnie suggests she does not want to be another girl on the list and that they\nshould end their relationship for good, Will embraces her and they kiss\npassionately, proving his feelings for her as akin to his quoting she's \"not\nlike the other girls.\" Marcus breaks up with Blaze because he wants Ronnie,\nwhich leads him and Will to fight at Megan's wedding party.\n\nRonnie soon hears the rumor that her father burned down the church from some\nlocals. Distraught, she goes to Will and laments about the situation. Will,\nknowing that it was actually his friend Scott who while playing around set\nfire to the church, is overcome by guilt and goes to Steve to apologize. When\nRonnie comes in hearing this, she walks out and Will follows where they have\nan argument and break up. Will leaves. Fall arrives and Jonah returns to New\nYork for the school year. Ronnie stays behind to take care of their father,\nwho revealed to Ronnie & Jonah during the summer that he is terminally ill.\nLeading a slow life, she tries to make up for the time with her father that\nshe's lost. She continues work on a composition he had been writing (titled\n\"For Ronnie\"), after losing the steadiness of his hands due to his illness. He\ndies just as she finishes it.\n\nAt his funeral she stands to make a speech but declares that no words could\never be able to show how wonderful her father really was. Instead, she decides\nto share with them the song she helped finish. Before she sits down to play,\nsunlight shines through the stained glass window. Ronnie smiles and says \"Hi,\nDaddy,\" remembering what she overheard her father tell Jonah earlier in the\nmovie; that whenever light shines through the window, it's him.\n\nBlaze and other townsfolk offer Ronnie sympathy and kind words after the\nfuneral outside. Later on, while talking to the attendants, she runs into\nWill. He says that he liked the song she played and that he knows her dad did\ntoo and Ronnie thanks him for coming. Having decided to attend Juilliard,\nRonnie is packing up to return to New York when she sees Will standing\noutside. She goes outside to see him and Will apologizes to her for everything\nthat had happened and Ronnie forgives him. Will surprises Ronnie by revealing\nthat he will be transferring to [Columbia](/wiki/Columbia_University \"Columbia\nUniversity\") in order to be with her and they passionately kiss.\n\nThe end credits show Ronnie driving away in her car and smiling to herself.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Last_Song_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/BarnettLashawayChaikin.jpg/225px-\nBarnettLashawayChaikin.jpg)](/wiki/File:BarnettLashawayChaikin.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:BarnettLashawayChaikin.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFrom left to right, cast members Adam Barnett, Nick Lashaway, and Carly\nChaikin make their way to the filming of the bonfire scene under the Tybee\nIsland pavilion on July 30, 2009.\n\n  * [Miley Cyrus](/wiki/Miley_Cyrus \"Miley Cyrus\") as Veronica \"Ronnie\" L.

[Tish\nCyrus](/wiki/Tish_Cyrus \"Tish Cyrus\"), Cyrus' mother and co-manager, became\nthe film's executive producer.[21] Cyrus' acting representation, [United\nTalent Agency](/wiki/United_Talent_Agency \"United Talent Agency\"), then\ncontacted Sparks, also a UTA client, to ask if he had plans for a novel\nappropriate for a film adaptation starring Cyrus.[22][23]\n\nAt the time, Sparks had been wrapping up _[The Lucky\nOne](/wiki/The_Lucky_One_\\(novel\\) \"The Lucky One \\(novel\\)\")_ and beginning\nto ponder an original plot for his next book. The author told himself he could\n\"either go younger than 20 or older than 50\", having recently written about\nevery age in between. Wary of venturing above 50 again after his best-seller\n_[The Notebook](/wiki/The_Notebook_\\(novel\\) \"The Notebook \\(novel\\)\")_ ,\nSparks had already been leaning toward writing a teenage story when he\nreceived a phone call from Gibgot on behalf of the film in August 2008.[5][22]\nSparks recalled, \"Jennifer asked if I had anything laying around? I said no,\nbut funny you should say that…\" Sparks returned with a premise by the end of\nJuly 2008.[5] Once the proposal had been agreed upon by Cyrus, her family, and\nOffspring Entertainment, Sparks, with the aid of co-screenplay writer Jeff Van\nWie, completed the screenplay before starting the book.[17][24] Sparks\nexplained that such an arrangement was necessary in order to accommodate\nfilming in summer 2009, as Disney had scheduled,[22] but that \"this is similar\nto the way it’s gone with movies based on my novels; it’s just out of\norder.\"[17] Sparks and Van Wie completed the first draft of the screenplay in\nDecember 2008, the first rewrite later that month, and the second and final\nrewrite in January 2009.[22][25] Both rewrites took approximately one or two\ndays, and Sparks found them relatively simple.[25] The finished screenplay was\napproximately 100 pages long.[26] While _The Last Song_ is not the first\nscreenplay Sparks has written, it is his first to be\n[optioned](/wiki/Option_\\(filmmaking\\) \"Option \\(filmmaking\\)\") for film.[26]\nThe novel was completed in June 2009, the same time shooting for the film\nbegan,[22] and was published on September 8, 2009 by [Grand Central\nPublishing](/wiki/Grand_Central_Publishing \"Grand Central\nPublishing\").[27][28] The plot of the film and novel remained secret\nthroughout development.[17]\n\n[![On the left in the foreground, a left facing man in a light blue shirt\nfaces a woman with short brown hair and a green jacket.

Robinson previously\nhelmed episodes of American series such as _[Weeds](/wiki/Weeds_\\(TV_series\\)\n\"Weeds \\(TV series\\)\")_ and _[Grey's Anatomy](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy \"Grey's\nAnatomy\")_ and earned a [Golden Globe](/wiki/Golden_Globe \"Golden Globe\")\nnomination and a [BAFTA](/wiki/BAFTA \"BAFTA\") award for her work on the BBC\nseries _[Viva\nBlackpool](/w/index.php?title=Viva_Blackpool&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Viva\nBlackpool \\(page does not exist\\)\")_.[21]\n\nIn a June 2009 blog entry, Cyrus said she had \"always been a fan of Nicholas\nSparks\" and that she had been waiting to do a production separate from the\n_Hannah Montana_ franchise \"for a long time\", but had not found the time to do\nso due to her TV show, [music](/wiki/Miley_Cyrus_discography \"Miley Cyrus\ndiscography\"), [tours](/wiki/List_of_Miley_Cyrus_concert_tours \"List of Miley\nCyrus concert tours\"), and _[Hannah Montana: The\nMovie](/wiki/Hannah_Montana:_The_Movie \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\")_.[30] In\norder to film _The Last Song_ , Cyrus' contract for season four of _Hannah\nMontana_ included an extra long hiatus.[31]\n\n### Writing and\ntitle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Last_Song_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Writing and title\")]\n\nRecognizing the popularity of _A Walk to Remember_ as both a novel and film,\nSparks \"put all [his] thoughts into that, trying to make the story as\ndifferent from _A Walk to Remember_ as [he could], but try to capture the same\nfeelings.\"[5] Sparks' experiences as a father and as a high school [track and\nfield](/wiki/Track_and_field \"Track and field\") coach also helped shape the\nplot, and characters Jonah Miller and Will Blakelee are respectively based on\nSparks' sons Landon and Miles. Sparks felt Ronnie was the hardest character to\nwrite for because he had \"never been a 17-year-old, angry teenage girl\".[32]\nRonnie became a [composite character](/wiki/Composite_character \"Composite\ncharacter\") inspired by several young women Sparks has known, such as his\nnieces.[33] Cyrus herself influenced Ronnie fairly little, although her\nsinging career did inspire the musical elements of the story.[32] Ronnie plays\nonly the piano and Cyrus only sings a small amount in the film,[17] though she\ndoes contribute to its soundtrack.[34]\n\nDisney did not give Sparks limitations on the topics featured in _The Last\nSong_ , which include underage drinking, infidelity, and terminal\nillness[5][9][32] but Sparks says that Disney desired to work with him in part\nbecause \"they’ve read my novels. My teenagers… don't do bad things. I just\ndon’t write that. I don’t write about adultery, I don’t write profanity ...\nI’ll certainly have love scenes in my novels, but they’re always between\nconsenting adults.”[5] Still, Sparks acknowledges that elements of the\nscreenplay may have been toned down by the director or the studio after he\nfinished. As dictated by the [Writers Guild of\nAmerica](/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America \"Writers Guild of America\"), Sparks\nreceives full credit for his work although the amount of his original\nscreenplay retained in the film is uncertain. For example, Sparks says the\ncharacter of Marcus, leader of the gang of thugs, was likely altered for the\nfilm.[5]\n\nThe project remained nameless for several months after Sparks' initial meeting\nwith Disney in July 2008.[5] Sparks wrote in a September 2008 online chat that\n\"I have the idea completed, but no title. That's common for me though. Titles\ncome last.\"[35] The film was referred to by the [working\ntitle](/wiki/Working_title \"Working title\") \"Untitled Miley Cyrus Project\"[36]\nIn March 2009, _[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_\nmagazine called \"The Last Song\" a \"tentative\" title.[37]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Last_Song_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\nCyrus chose the name \"Ronnie\" for her character in honor of her grandfather,\n[Ron Cyrus](/wiki/Ron_Cyrus \"Ron Cyrus\"), who died in 2006.[32] Unknown to\nmany the character had first been named \"[Kirby](/wiki/Kirby_\\(given_name\\)\n\"Kirby \\(given name\\)\")\" by Sparks and later changed to \"Hilary\". New\ninterviews with Sparks reveal he imagined Cyrus in the role \"only a little\"\nduring the writing process. The completion of the screenplay, concerned Sparks\nthat Cyrus would not be able to successfully execute the role: \"The first\nthing I thought when I finished the screenplay was, wow, I hope she can do\nthis, this is a tough role because I'm bringing you through a whole gamut of\nemotion and you're just a 16-year-old girl who's done the Disney Channel. Are\nyou able to do this as an actress?\",[26] After visiting the set and watching\nCyrus film, Sparks' worries abated.[26] To play the New York teen, Cyrus\nworked with a [dialect coach](/wiki/Dialect_coach \"Dialect coach\") to lose her\n[Southern accent](/wiki/Southern_American_English \"Southern American\nEnglish\")[38] and learned to play classical piano.[39] After she completed\nfilming, Cyrus said that in a case of [life imitating\nart](/wiki/Life_imitating_art \"Life imitating art\"),[40] she had matured and\n\"changed a lot\" over the course of her summer in Georgia, similar to the way\nRonnie does in the film. \"Showing this movie, I feel like I'm really showing a\npart of my growth as a person as well. So I'm really excited for people to see\nit.\"[41]\n\nIn April 2009, Disney officials chose [Rafi Gavron](/wiki/Rafi_Gavron \"Rafi\nGavron\") for the part of Will Blakelee, but switched to Australian actor Liam\nHemsworth by May.[42] On May 18, 2009, the decision to cast Greg Kinnear as\nSteve Miller was made final.[42] Kelly Preston's part as Kim is the first role\nshe has accepted since the death of her son, [Jett\nTravolta](/wiki/Jett_Travolta \"Jett Travolta\").[43] After being introduced to\n[Cal Johnson](/wiki/Cal_Johnson \"Cal Johnson\"), the film's [stunt\ncoordinator](/wiki/Stunt_coordinator \"Stunt coordinator\"), Adam Barnett landed\nthe role of Teddy in May 2009 due to his pre-developed talent in juggling and\nhackey sack.[44]\n\n### Post-\nproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Last_Song_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Post-production\")]\n\n_The Last Song_ entered [post-production](/wiki/Post-production \"Post-\nproduction\") following the end of filming on August 18, 2009.[45] [Automated\ndialogue replacement](/wiki/Automated_dialogue_replacement \"Automated dialogue\nreplacement\") took place in mid-September; Beals and Chaikin stated they had\ngone in to record on September 11[46] and September 18[47] respectively.\nChaikin said she had worked for five and a half hours.[47] The [director's\ncut](/wiki/Director%27s_cut \"Director's cut\") was presented to the studio on\nOctober 1, 2009.[48] The [Motion Picture Association of\nAmerica](/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America \"Motion Picture\nAssociation of America\") reviewed the film and issued it a [PG\nrating](/wiki/PG-Rating \"PG-Rating\") for \"thematic material, some violence,\nsensuality and mild language\" three weeks later.[49]\n\n##\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Last_Song_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\n### Move to\nGeorgia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Last_Song_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Move to Georgia\")]\n\nNobody knows what's going to happen [...] Georgia wants them badly, and we\nwant them badly, and by Monday, there'll be four or five other states that\nwant them badly.\n\n—Bev Perdue, Governor of North Carolina[50]\n\n_The Last Song_ had originally been set in [Wrightsville\nBeach](/wiki/Wrightsville_Beach,_North_Carolina \"Wrightsville Beach, North\nCarolina\") and [Wilmington](/wiki/Wilmington,_North_Carolina \"Wilmington,\nNorth Carolina\") in North Carolina. Though they wished to shoot on location,\nfilmmakers also examined three other states and identified Georgia as the next\nbest filming site.[29] Georgia’s housing prices were higher, but the state’s\nfilming incentive package refunded 30% of production costs such as gasoline,\npencils, and salaries. North Carolina’s\n[package](/wiki/North_Carolina_Film_Office#Film_Incentives_Program \"North\nCarolina Film Office\") refunded 15% and excluded salaries of over $1\nmillion.[51] Still, Disney remained interested in North Carolina and offered\nto film there if the state would reduce the amount the company would save in\nGeorgia, approximately $1 million, in half. North Carolina officials searched\nfor ways to accomplish this, including applying unsuccessfully for state and\n[Golden LEAF Foundation](/wiki/Golden_LEAF_Foundation \"Golden LEAF\nFoundation\") grants.[52] They also introduced legislation to improve the\nstate’s refund to 25%,[51] which eventually passed on August 27, 2009.[53]\nDisney decided to work within existing incentive laws and agreed to film in\nNorth Carolina as long as the film rights they had bought from Sparks counted\nas a production cost, thereby saving the company an additional $125,000 to\n$225,000. Then-North Carolina Governor [Bev Perdue](/wiki/Bev_Perdue \"Bev\nPerdue\") set up a press conference on April 1, 2009 to announce N.C.’s\nvictory. North Carolina [tax collectors](/wiki/Tax_collector \"Tax collector\")\nrefused to consider the film rights, forcing Perdue to cancel the conference\nat the last second.[52] \"I was hopeful to say that it was coming and now I\ndon't know that I'll get to say that,\" Perdue said. \"Nobody knows what's going\nto happen [...] I don't know what figures they got from Georgia, but Georgia\nwants them badly, and we want them badly, and by Monday [April 6, 2009],\nthere'll be four or five other states that want them badly.\"[50] Johnny\nGriffin, director of the Wilmington Regional Film Commission, explains:\n\"Disney makes feature films. They also make [television\nseries](/wiki/List_of_Disney_Channel_Original_Series \"List of Disney Channel\nOriginal Series\"); they make [individual\nmovies](/wiki/List_of_Disney_Channel_Original_Movies \"List of Disney Channel\nOriginal Movies\") for the Disney Channel.

After another three months and the discovery\nof the \"Adams Cottage\" on the southern tip of Tybee Island, Tybee and\nneighboring locations became the sites of filming in late March,[54] with the\nintention of masquerading the area as Wilmington and Wrightsville Beach, North\nCarolina.,[55] The locale proved too unique to disguise. “We had a hard time\ntrying to hide the fact that this was Tybee and Savannah was Savannah,\" said\nBass Hampton, the film's location director.[55] Filmmakers convinced the\nscreenwriters to change the setting of the film and to Tybee Island, thus\nallowing them to incorporate landmarks such as the [Tybee Island Light\nStation](/wiki/Tybee_Island_Light_Station \"Tybee Island Light Station\") and\nthe [Savannah Historic\nDistrict](/wiki/Savannah_Historic_District_\\(Savannah,_Georgia\\) \"Savannah\nHistoric District \\(Savannah, Georgia\\)\").[55][56] The setting of Sparks'\nnovel remained in North Carolina.[5] Though other movies have been filmed in\nTybee Island, _The Last Song_ is the first to be both filmed and set in Tybee\nIsland.[54] With the city’s name plastered on everything from police cars to\nbusinesses, Georgia officials predict a lasting effect on the economy.[55] In\naddition, _The Last Song_ is estimated to have brought up to 500 summer\njobs[52] to Georgia, $8 million to local businesses,[57] and $17.5 million to\nstate businesses.[52]\n\n###\nSets[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Last_Song_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Sets\")]\n\n[![ Two men, dressed in white shirts and loose pants, are seen beneath a\nwooden pavilion.
