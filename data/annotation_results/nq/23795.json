However, its\ngraphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature\ncontent prompted concerns from mental health professionals.

Inside he discovers seven [cassette](/wiki/Compact_Cassette \"Compact\nCassette\") tapes recorded by [Hannah Baker](/wiki/Hannah_Baker \"Hannah\nBaker\"), his deceased classmate and [unrequited love](/wiki/Unrequited_love\n\"Unrequited love\"), who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes,\nHannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided\nto end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style\ntapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the\nfirst to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should\npass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to\ndistribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should\nthe plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in\nHannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to\nboth friends and enemies.\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people\nmentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members,\nbecome embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty\nHigh School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother\npursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial\nand her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's\nfather. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by\nthose who present in court at trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an\ninvestigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on\nthe civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavours\nto expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favour of wealthy,\n[sports savvy male students](/wiki/Jock_\\(stereotype\\) \"Jock \\(stereotype\\)\")\nover the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young\ngirls such as Hannah.\n\nThroughout season two, Clay appears to be communicating with the ghost of\nHannah as a plot narrative device.\n\n## Cast and characters\n\n### Main\n\n  * [Dylan Minnette](/wiki/Dylan_Minnette \"Dylan Minnette\") as [Clay Jensen](/wiki/Clay_Jensen \"Clay Jensen\"), a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her.[3]\n  * [Katherine Langford](/wiki/Katherine_Langford \"Katherine Langford\") as [Hannah Baker](/wiki/Hannah_Baker \"Hannah Baker\"), a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series.[3] (seasons 1–2)\n  * [Christian Navarro](/wiki/Christian_Navarro \"Christian Navarro\") as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death.[3]\n  * [Alisha Boe](/wiki/Alisha_Boe \"Alisha Boe\") as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah.[3]\n  * [Brandon Flynn](/wiki/Brandon_Flynn \"Brandon Flynn\") as Justin Foley, a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.[3]\n  * [Justin Prentice](/wiki/Justin_Prentice \"Justin Prentice\") as Bryce Walker, a student from a rich family and the captain of the football team at Liberty High.[3]\n  * [Miles Heizer](/wiki/Miles_Heizer \"Miles Heizer\") as Alex Standall, a student at Liberty High, the ex-boyfriend of Jessica and a former friend of Hannah.[3]\n  * [Ross Butler](/wiki/Ross_Butler_\\(actor\\) \"Ross Butler \\(actor\\)\") as Zach Dempsey, a cowardly but kindhearted friend of Justin and Bryce at Liberty High.[3]\n  * [Devin Druid](/wiki/Devin_Druid \"Devin Druid\") as Tyler Down, a bullied student at Liberty High and an avid photographer.[3]\n  * [Amy Hargreaves](/wiki/Amy_Hargreaves \"Amy Hargreaves\") as Lainie Jensen, Clay's attorney mother.[4]\n  * [Derek Luke](/wiki/Derek_Luke_\\(actor\\) \"Derek Luke \\(actor\\)\") as Kevin Porter, a guidance counselor at Liberty High.[5]\n  * [Kate Walsh](/wiki/Kate_Walsh_\\(actress\\) \"Kate Walsh \\(actress\\)\") as Olivia Baker, Hannah's mother, who is determined to uncover the truth about the events leading to her daughter's suicide.[5]\n  * [Brian d'Arcy James](/wiki/Brian_d%27Arcy_James \"Brian d'Arcy James\") as Andy Baker, Hannah's father and Olivia's husband.[6] (season 2; recurring season 1)\n\n### Recurring\n\n#### Introduced in season one\n\n  * [Josh Hamilton](/wiki/Josh_Hamilton_\\(actor\\) \"Josh Hamilton \\(actor\\)\") as Matt Jensen, Clay's father, a psychologist.\n  * Michele Selene Ang as Courtney Crimsen, a closeted student at Liberty High who is responsible for spreading rumors about Hannah to protect the secret of her own sexual orientation.

The series\nalso showed an 18% increase in week-over-week viewership from week one to week\ntwo. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more\nthan 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of\nthe company’s U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix\nviewers who watched at least one episode of the season.[25]\n\n### Critical response\n\n#### Season 1\n\nThe first season has received positive reviews from critics, with much of the\npraise for the show being aimed at its acting, directing, story, visuals,\nimprovements upon its source material, and mature approach to dark and adult\nsubject matter. The [review aggregator](/wiki/Review_aggregator \"Review\naggregator\") website [Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten\nTomatoes\") reported an 80% approval rating with an average rating of 7.2/10,\nbased on 51 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"_13 Reasons Why_\ncomplements its bestselling source material with a gripping look at adolescent\ngrief whose narrative maturity belies its YA milieu.\"[26]\n[Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\"), which uses a weighted average,\nassigned a score of 76 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating generally\nfavorable reviews.[27]\n\nJesse Schedeen of [IGN](/wiki/IGN \"IGN\") praised _13 Reasons Why_ , giving it\na 9.2 out of 10, \"Amazing\", stating that the show is \"a very powerful and\nhard-hitting series\" and \"ranks among the best high school dramas of the 21st\ncentury\".[28] Matthew Gilbert of _[The Boston Globe](/wiki/The_Boston_Globe\n\"The Boston Globe\")_ gave a glowing review for the show, saying, \"The drama is\nsensitive, consistently engaging, and, most importantly, unblinking.\"[29]\nMaureen Ryan of _[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_\nasserts that the show \"is undoubtedly sincere, but it's also, in many\nimportant ways, creatively successful\" and called it \"simply essential\nviewing\".[30] Leah Greenblatt of _[Entertainment\nWeekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment Weekly\")_ gave the entire\nseason a score of B+, calling the show \"a frank, authentically affecting\nportrait of what it feels like to be young, lost and too fragile for the\nworld\".[31] Daniel Feinberg of _[The Hollywood\nReporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood Reporter\")_ also praised\nthe show, calling it \"an honorably mature piece of young-adult adaptation\",\nand citing its performances, direction, relevance and maturity as some of the\nshow's strongest points.[32]\n\nThe acting, particularly Katherine Langford as Hannah and Dylan Minnette as\nClay, was frequently mentioned and widely lauded in several reviews. Schedeen\nof [IGN](/wiki/IGN \"IGN\") praised the cast, particularly Minnette and\nLangford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role... [and] embodies that\noptimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is,\nby design, a much more stoic and reserved character... and does a fine job in\nwhat's often a difficult role.\"[28] Gilbert of _The Boston Globe_ praised the\nchemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young\nactors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying\nthat they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of\nwarm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit\nto their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of _The Hollywood Reporter_ also\npraises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a\nfate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic\nrange, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in\ndifferentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to\nred-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"[32]\n\nRyan of _Variety_ also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the\nsupporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's\nmother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".[30] Positive mentions from\nvarious critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the\nsupporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and\nChristian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony). Liz\nShannon Miller of _[Indiewire](/wiki/Indiewire \"Indiewire\")_ , who enjoyed the\nshow and gave it a positive score of B+, gave praise to the racial, gender and\ncomplex diversity of its supporting cast of teens.[30][28][32][33]\n\nAnother aspect frequently mentioned within reviews was the show's mature and\nemotional approach to its dark and adult subject matter. This was favorably\nreviewed by critics, such as Miller of _Indiewire_ , particularly her\nstatement that \"the adult edges to this story ring with honesty and\ntruth.\"[33] Miller, and Feinberg of _The Hollywood Reporter_ , also stated\nthat the show can be difficult to watch at times,[32] while Schedeen of IGN\nstates that it is \"an often depressing and even uncomfortable show to watch...\na pretty emotionally draining experience, particularly towards the end as the\npieces really start to fall into place.\"[28]\n\nNumerous critics also praised several other aspects of the show. Feinberg\nhighlighted the show's directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of\ndirectors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the\nperformances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\",[33] while\nGilbert of _The Boston Globe_ praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling\ntechniques are powerful... [as it] builds on the world established in the\nprevious hour, as we continually encounter new facets of Hannah's life and new\ncharacters. The background on the show keeps getting deeper, richer.\"[29]\n\nConversely, the series has also received criticism over its portrayal of teen\nangst. Mike Hale of _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New\nYork Times\")_ wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make\n[Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a\nvery long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device\nthat has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting\nlike the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense\nas anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's\nantagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"[34]\n\nWriting for _[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_ , Rebecca\nNicholson praised some aspects of the show, including the performances from\nMinnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a\nstoryline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out\nadded to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that\nthe show would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school\nsuch as _[Freaks and Geeks](/wiki/Freaks_and_Geeks \"Freaks and Geeks\")_ and\n_[My So-Called Life](/wiki/My_So-Called_Life \"My So-Called Life\")_ : \"It lacks\nthe crossover wit of its forebears... It's too tied up in conveying the\nmessage that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any\nsubtleties or shades of feeling. It's largely one-note – and that note is\nhorrifying. 'It has to get better,' implores one student towards the end, but\ngiven its fairly open ending, an apparent season two setup, it does not seem\nas if there's much chance of that happening.\"[35]\n\n_[Washington Post](/wiki/Washington_Post \"Washington Post\")_ television critic\n[Hank Stuever](/wiki/Hank_Stuever \"Hank Stuever\") wrote a negative review,\nfinding _13 Reasons Why_ \"contrived\" and implausible: \"There are 13 episodes\nlasting 13 super-sullen hours – a passive-aggressive, implausibly meandering,\npoorly written and awkwardly acted effort that is mainly about\nmiscommunication, delivering no more wisdom or insight about depression,\nbullying and suicide than one of those old _[ABC Afterschool\nSpecials](/wiki/After_school_special \"After school special\")_ people now mock\nfor being so corny.\" He also wrote that he found Hannah's suicide tapes \"a\nprotracted example of the teenager who fantasizes how everyone will react when\nshe's gone. The story ... strikes me as remarkably, even dangerously, naive in\nits understanding of suicide, up to and including a gruesome, penultimate\nscene of Hannah opening her wrists in a bathtub.\"[36]\n\n[David Wiegand](/wiki/David_Wiegand \"David Wiegand\") of the _[San Francisco\nChronicle](/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle \"San Francisco Chronicle\")_ gave the\nseries a tepid review, saying that it was plagued by character\ninconsistencies, particularly Hannah. He praised Langford's \"stunning\nperformance\" but noted, \"There are times when we simply don't believe the\ncharacters, when what they do or say isn't consistent with who we've been led\nto believe they are... At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at\nbest to the behavior of the popular kids.

The site's critical consensus\nstates, \"By deviating from its source material, _13 Reasons Why_ can better\nexplore its tenderly crafted characters; unfortunately, in the process, it\nloses track of what made the show so gripping in the first place.\"[40] On\nMetacritic the season has an average score of 49 out of 100, based on 16\ncritics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[41]\n\nA scene in which the character Tyler gets viciously attacked and sexually\nassaulted during the finale also caused controversy from fans and critics of\nthe series, with some describing it as \"unnecessary\" and \"traumatizing\".[42]\nThe series' showrunner has defended the scene, saying that it was included in\nan attempt to \"[tell] truthful stories about things that young people go\nthrough in as unflinching a way as we can\".[43]\n\n### Social impact\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/1300_Reasons_WHY_NOT.jpg/220px-1300_Reasons_WHY_NOT.jpg)](/wiki/File:1300_Reasons_WHY_NOT.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1300_Reasons_WHY_NOT.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Rowan University](/wiki/Rowan_University \"Rowan University\")'s Counseling and\nPsychological Services office mocked the show with a campaign challenging\nstudents to come up with 1300 reasons not to commit suicide. The expressions\nof hope were hung in windows alongside mental health contact information.[44]\n\nThe series has generated controversy over its portrayal of suicide and self-\nharm, prompting Netflix to add strong advisory warnings prior to the first,\ntwelfth, and thirteenth episodes. School psychologists and educators expressed\nconcern about the series.\n\nThe superintendent of [Palm Beach County,\nFlorida](/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida \"Palm Beach County, Florida\")\nschools reportedly told parents that their schools had seen an increase in\nsuicidal and self-harming behavior from students, and that some of those\nstudents \"have articulated associations of their at-risk behavior to the _13\nReasons Why_ Netflix series\".[45]\n\nThe Australian youth mental health service for 12–25 year-olds,\n[Headspace](/wiki/Headspace_\\(organisation\\) \"Headspace \\(organisation\\)\"),\nissued a warning in late April 2017 over the graphic content featured in the\nseries, due to the increased number of calls to the service following the\nshow's release in the country. [Netflix](/wiki/Netflix \"Netflix\") however,\ndemonstrably complied with the Australian viewer ratings system, by branding\nthe series as \"MA15+\" when streamed via its own interface. They accompanied\nits presentation with additional warnings and viewer advice, and ensured that\ncounselling referrals were included and not easily skipped at the conclusion\nof each episode, even including an Australian accent in the voice over for\nthose referrals every fifth episode. The \"MA15+\" rating in Australia requires\na guardian to accompany a minor to an Australian cinema to allow admission of\nthose under 18 years of age. \"MA15+\" also prohibits the admission of anyone\nunder the age of 15, requiring proof-of-age identification.[46][47][48]\n\nIn response to the graphic nature of the show and New Zealand's high youth\nsuicide rate, which was the highest among the 34[a] [OECD](/wiki/OECD \"OECD\")\ncountries during 2009 to 2012,[50][51] the [Office of Film & Literature\nClassification](/wiki/Office_of_Film_and_Literature_Classification_\\(New_Zealand\\)\n\"Office of Film and Literature Classification \\(New Zealand\\)\") in the country\ncreated a new rating, \"RP18\", allowing individuals aged 18 and over to watch\nthe series alone and those below having to watch it with supervision from a\nparent or guardian.[52][53]\n\nWe stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] [Jay\nAsher](/wiki/Jay_Asher \"Jay Asher\") created was a beautifully tragic,\ncomplicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do ...\nWe wanted to do it justice and, yeah, [the backlash is] gonna come no matter\nwhat. It's not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how\nit's doing.\n\n—Executive producer [Selena Gomez](/wiki/Selena_Gomez \"Selena Gomez\"), in\ndefense of the controversy surrounding the series[54]\n\nIn April 2017, the [National Association of School\nPsychologists](/wiki/National_Association_of_School_Psychologists \"National\nAssociation of School Psychologists\") (NASP) in the United States released a\nstatement regarding the series, saying: \"Research shows that exposure to\nanother person's suicide, or to graphic or sensationalized accounts of death,\ncan be one of the many risk factors that youth struggling with mental health\nconditions cite as a reason they contemplate or attempt suicide.\"[55] NASP\nsent a letter to school mental health professionals across the country about\nthe series, reportedly a first for NASP in response to a television show.[56]\nThe following month, the United States [Society of Clinical Child and\nAdolescent\nPsychology](/wiki/Society_of_Clinical_Child_and_Adolescent_Psychology \"Society\nof Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology\") (SCCAP) released a statement\nalso noting how strongly the show may serve as a trigger for self-injury among\nvulnerable youth. They lamented the depiction of mental health professionals\nas ineffective for youth who have experienced trauma and may have been\nconsidering suicide.[57] The statement implored Netflix to add a tag following\neach episode with mental health resources, and a reminder that depression and\nsuicide can be effectively treated by a qualified mental health professional,\nsuch as a clinical child psychologist, using [evidence-based\npractice](/wiki/Evidence-based_practice \"Evidence-based practice\").\n\nSimilarly, [clinical psychologists](/wiki/Clinical_psychologists \"Clinical\npsychologists\") such as Daniel J. Reidenberg and Erika Martinez, as well as\nmental health advocate MollyKate Cline of _Teen Vogue_ magazine, have\nexpressed concerns regarding the risk of [suicide\ncontagion](/wiki/Suicide_contagion \"Suicide contagion\").[58][59][60] However,\nEric Beeson, a counselor at The Family Institute at [Northwestern\nUniversity](/wiki/Northwestern_University \"Northwestern University\") noted\nthat \"it's unlikely that one show alone could trigger someone to attempt\nsuicide.\"[55] Mental health professionals have also criticized the series'\ndepiction of suicide itself, much of which violates widely promulgated\nrecommendations for reporting on actual suicides or not depicting them in\nfiction, in order to not encourage copycat suicides.[61] The season finale,\nwhich depicts Hannah's suicide in graphic detail, has been particularly\ncriticized in this regard.[62] Nic Sheff, a writer for the show, has defended\nit as intended to dispel the myth that suicides \"quietly drift off\", and\nrecalled how he himself was deterred from a suicide attempt by recalling a\nsurvivor's account of how painful and horrifying it was.[63]\n\nThe NASP statement also criticized the show's suggestion that bullying alone\nled Hannah to take her life, noting that while it may be a contributing\nfactor, suicidal ideations far more often result from the bullied person\nhaving a treatable mental illness without adequate [coping\nmechanisms](/wiki/Coping_mechanism \"Coping mechanism\"). Alex Moen, a [school\ncounselor](/wiki/School_counselor \"School counselor\") in Minneapolis, took\nissue with the show's entire plotline as \"...essentially a fantasy of what\nsomeone who is considering suicide might have—that once you commit suicide,\nyou can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly\nrealize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain ...\nThat the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for\nyou, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be\nable to live.\"[62] Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's\nattempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only\ndoes he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot\nreport her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant.\nSchool counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular\nculture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to\nbeing unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not\npolice. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever\ninformation we do have to the police\", she told\n_[Slate](/wiki/Slate_\\(website\\) \"Slate \\(website\\)\")_.[62]\n\nIn May 2017, the [Canadian Mental Health\nAssociation](/wiki/Canadian_Mental_Health_Association \"Canadian Mental Health\nAssociation\") (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP)\nreleased a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA\nbelieved that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead\nto distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the\nportrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out\nby the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [American\nAssociation of Suicidology](/wiki/American_Association_of_Suicidology\n\"American Association of Suicidology\"). CMHA and CASP did praise the show for\nraising awareness about \"...[this preventable health concern](/wiki/Suicide\n\"Suicide\"),\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and\nresponsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international\nresearch has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful\nmedia portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may\ncause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may\nsimplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause;\nthey may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of\na Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option;\nthey may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to\nviewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that\nsuicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"[64][65]\n\nOne study found the release of _13 Reasons Why_ corresponded with between\n900,000 and 1,500,000 more suicide-related searches in the United States,\nincluding a 26% increase in searches for \"how to commit suicide,\" an 18%\nincrease for \"commit suicide,\" and a 9% increase for \"how to kill\nyourself.\"[66] A review, however, found that it is unclear if searching for\ninformation about suicide on the Internet relates to the risk of suicide.[67]\n\n### Accolades\n\nYear  | Award  | Category  | Nominee(s)  | Result  | Ref.  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n2017  | [Gold Derby Awards](/wiki/Gold_Derby_Awards \"Gold Derby Awards\") | Breakthrough Performer of the Year  | [Katherine Langford](/wiki/Katherine_Langford \"Katherine Langford\") | Nominated  | [68]  \n2018  | [Golden Globe Awards](/wiki/75th_Golden_Globe_Awards \"75th Golden Globe Awards\") | [Best Actress – Television Series Drama](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_%E2%80%93_Television_Series_Drama \"Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama\") | [Katherine Langford](/wiki/Katherine_Langford \"Katherine Langford\") | Nominated  | [69]  \n[Guild of Music Supervisors Awards](/wiki/Guild_of_Music_Supervisors_Awards \"Guild of Music Supervisors Awards\") | Best Music Supervision in a Television Drama  | Season Kent  | Won  | [70]  \n[Imagen Awards](/wiki/Imagen_Awards \"Imagen Awards\") | Best Actor – Television  | [Christian Navarro](/wiki/Christian_Navarro \"Christian Navarro\") | Pending  | [71]  \n[MTV Movie & TV Awards](/wiki/2018_MTV_Movie_%26_TV_Awards \"2018 MTV Movie & TV Awards\") | [Best Show](/wiki/MTV_Movie_%26_TV_Award_for_Best_Show \"MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Show\") | _13 Reasons Why_ | Nominated  | [72]  \n[Best Performance in a Show](/wiki/MTV_Movie_%26_TV_Award_for_Best_Performance_in_a_Show \"MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Performance in a Show\") | [Katherine Langford](/wiki/Katherine_Langford \"Katherine Langford\") | Nominated   \n[NAACP Image Awards](/wiki/49th_NAACP_Image_Awards \"49th NAACP Image Awards\") | [Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series](/wiki/NAACP_Image_Award_for_Outstanding_Directing_in_a_Drama_Series \"NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series\") | [Carl Franklin](/wiki/Carl_Franklin \"Carl Franklin\") for \"Tape 5, Side B\" | Won  | [73]  \n[Satellite Awards](/wiki/22nd_Satellite_Awards \"22nd Satellite Awards\") | [Best Actress in a Drama / Genre Series](/wiki/Satellite_Award_for_Best_Actress_%E2%80%93_Television_Series_Drama \"Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama\") | [Katherine Langford](/wiki/Katherine_Langford \"Katherine Langford\") | Nominated  | [74]  \n[Best Drama Series](/wiki/Satellite_Award_for_Best_Television_Series_%E2%80%93_Drama \"Satellite Award for Best Television Series – Drama\") | _13 Reasons Why_ | Nominated   \n[Television Academy Honors](/wiki/Television_Academy_Honors \"Television Academy Honors\") | Television with a Conscience  | _13 Reasons Why_ | Won  | [75]  \n  \n## _Beyond the Reasons_\n\nWith the release of the first season of the series, Netflix also released _13\nReasons Why: Beyond the Reasons_ , an [aftershow](/wiki/Aftershow \"Aftershow\")\n[documentary television film](/wiki/Television_documentary \"Television\ndocumentary\").
