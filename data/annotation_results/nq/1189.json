This spin serves to\n[gyroscopically](/wiki/Gyroscope \"Gyroscope\") stabilize the projectile by\n[conservation of angular momentum](/wiki/Conservation_of_angular_momentum\n\"Conservation of angular momentum\"), improving its\n[aerodynamic](/wiki/Aerodynamics \"Aerodynamics\") stability and accuracy over\n[smoothbore](/wiki/Smoothbore \"Smoothbore\") designs.\n\nRifling is often described by its **twist rate** , which indicates the\ndistance the rifling takes to complete one full revolution, such as \"1 turn in\n10 inches\" (1:10 inches), or \"1 turn in 254 mm\" (1:254 mm). A shorter distance\nindicates a \"faster\" twist, meaning that for a given velocity the projectile\nwill be rotating at a higher spin rate.\n\nThe combination of length, weight and shape of a projectile determines the\ntwist rate needed to stabilize it – barrels intended for short, large-diameter\nprojectiles like spherical lead balls require a very low twist rate, such as 1\nturn in 48 inches (122 cm).[1] Barrels intended for long, small-diameter\nbullets, such as the ultra-low-drag, 80-[grain](/wiki/Grain_\\(mass\\) \"Grain\n\\(mass\\)\") 0.223 inch bullets (5.2 g, 5.56 mm), use twist rates of 1 turn in 8\ninches (20 cm) or faster.[2]\n\nIn some cases, rifling will have twist rates that increase down the length of\nthe barrel, called a _gain twist_ or _progressive twist_ ; a twist rate that\ndecreases from [breech](/wiki/Breech-loading_weapon \"Breech-loading weapon\")\nto [muzzle](/wiki/Muzzle_\\(firearms\\) \"Muzzle \\(firearms\\)\") is undesirable,\nsince it cannot reliably stabilize the bullet as it travels down the\nbore.[3][4] Extremely long projectiles such as [flechettes](/wiki/Flechette\n\"Flechette\") may require high twist rates; these projectiles must be\ninherently stable, and are often fired from a [smoothbore](/wiki/Smoothbore\n\"Smoothbore\") barrel.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Recent developments\n      * 1.1.1 Polygonal rifling\n      * 1.1.2 Extended range, full bore\n      * 1.1.3 Gain-twist rifling\n  * 2 Manufacture\n  * 3 Construction and operation\n  * 4 Fitting the projectile to the bore\n  * 5 Twist rate\n    * 5.1 Expressing twist rate\n    * 5.2 Twist rate and bullet stability\n    * 5.3 Bullet spin\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n    * 8.1 Calculators for stability and twist\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Zuege.jpg/220px-\nZuege.jpg)](/wiki/File:Zuege.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Zuege.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTraditional rifling of a 9 mm handgun barrel.\n\nMain article: [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle \"Rifle\")\n\nMuskets were [smoothbore](/wiki/Smoothbore \"Smoothbore\"), large caliber\nweapons using ball-shaped ammunition fired at relatively low velocity. Due to\nthe high cost and great difficulty of precision manufacturing, and the need to\nload readily and speedily from the muzzle, musket balls were generally a loose\nfit in the barrels. Consequently, on firing the balls would often bounce off\nthe sides of the barrel when fired and the final destination after leaving the\nmuzzle was less predictable. This was countered when accuracy was more\nimportant, for example when hunting, by using a tighter combination of a\ncloser to bore sized ball and a patch. The accuracy was improved, but still\nnot reliable for precision shooting over long distances.\n\nBarrel rifling was invented in [Augsburg](/wiki/Augsburg \"Augsburg\"),\n[Germany](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\") in 1498.[5] In 1520 August Kotter, an\narmourer of [Nuremberg](/wiki/Nuremberg \"Nuremberg\"), Germany improved upon\nthis work. Though true rifling dates from the mid-16th century, it did not\nbecome commonplace until the nineteenth century.\n\nThe concept of stabilizing the flight of a projectile by spinning it was known\nin the days of bows and arrows, but early firearms using black powder had\ndifficulty with rifling because of the fouling left behind by the combustion\nof the powder. The most successful weapons using rifling with black powder\nwere [breech loaders](/wiki/Breech-loading_weapon \"Breech-loading weapon\")\nsuch as the [Queen Anne pistol](/wiki/Queen_Anne_pistol \"Queen Anne pistol\").\n\n### Recent\ndevelopments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Recent developments\")]\n\n#### Polygonal rifling[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Polygonal rifling\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Polygonal_vs_normal_rifling.svg/220px-\nPolygonal_vs_normal_rifling.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Polygonal_vs_normal_rifling.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Polygonal_vs_normal_rifling.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nConventional rifling (left) and [polygonal rifling](/wiki/Polygonal_rifling\n\"Polygonal rifling\") (right). Both types of rifling use a spiraling pattern.\n\nMain article: [Polygonal rifling](/wiki/Polygonal_rifling \"Polygonal rifling\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Hammer_forged_6-right_polygonal_rifling_pattern.png/220px-\nHammer_forged_6-right_polygonal_rifling_pattern.png)](/wiki/File:Hammer_forged_6-right_polygonal_rifling_pattern.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hammer_forged_6-right_polygonal_rifling_pattern.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe spiraling pattern (here with polygonal rifling) is shown.\n\nThe grooves most commonly used in modern rifling have fairly sharp edges. More\nrecently, [polygonal rifling](/wiki/Polygonal_rifling \"Polygonal rifling\"), a\nthrowback to the earliest types of rifling, has become popular, especially in\n[handguns](/wiki/Handgun \"Handgun\"). Polygonal barrels tend to have longer\nservice lives because the reduction of the sharp edges of the land (the\ngrooves are the spaces that are cut out, and the resulting ridges are called\nlands) reduces erosion of the barrel. Supporters of polygonal rifling also\nclaim higher velocities and greater accuracy. Polygonal rifling is currently\nseen on pistols from [CZ](/wiki/%C4%8Cesk%C3%A1_zbrojovka_Uhersk%C3%BD_Brod\n\"Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod\"), [Heckler & Koch](/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch\n\"Heckler & Koch\"), [Glock](/wiki/Glock \"Glock\"), [Tanfoglio](/wiki/Tanfoglio\n\"Tanfoglio\"), and [Kahr Arms](/wiki/Kahr_Arms \"Kahr Arms\"), as well as the\n[Desert Eagle](/wiki/Desert_Eagle \"Desert Eagle\").\n\n#### Extended range, full\nbore[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section:\nExtended range, full bore\")]\n\nFor tanks and artillery pieces, the **extended range, full bore** concept\ndeveloped by [Gerald Bull](/wiki/Gerald_Bull \"Gerald Bull\") for the [GC-45\nhowitzer](/wiki/GC-45_howitzer \"GC-45 howitzer\") reverses the normal rifling\nidea by using a projectile with small fins that ride in the grooves, as\nopposed to using a projectile with a slightly oversized [driving\nband](/wiki/Driving_band \"Driving band\") which is forced into the grooves.\nSuch guns have achieved significant increases in muzzle velocity and range.\nExamples include the [South African](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\")\n[G5](/wiki/G5_howitzer \"G5 howitzer\") and the [German](/wiki/Germany\n\"Germany\") [PzH 2000](/wiki/PzH_2000 \"PzH 2000\").\n\n#### Gain-twist\nrifling[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section:\nGain-twist rifling\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-\nnew.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg)|\nThis section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

This enables the bullet to remain essentially\nundisturbed and trued to the case mouth. After engaging the rifling the bullet\nis progressively subjected to [accelerated](/wiki/Accelerate \"Accelerate\")\n[angular momentum](/wiki/Angular_momentum \"Angular momentum\") as burning\npowder propels it down the barrel. By only gradually increasing the spin rate,\ntorque is spread along a much longer section of barrel, rather than only at\nthe throat where rifling is eroded through repeated rifling engagement.\n\nGain-twist rifling was used as early as the [American Civil\nWar](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") (1861–65). Colt\n[Army](/wiki/Colt_Army_Model_1860 \"Colt Army Model 1860\") and\n[Navy](/wiki/Colt_M1861_Navy \"Colt M1861 Navy\") revolvers both employed gain-\ntwist rifling. Gain-twist rifling, however, is more difficult to produce than\nuniform rifling, and therefore is more expensive. The military has used gain-\ntwist rifling in a variety of weapons such as the 6998200000000000000♠20 mm\n[M61 Vulcan](/wiki/M61_Vulcan \"M61 Vulcan\") Gatling gun used in some current\nfighter jets and the larger 6998300000000000000♠30 mm [GAU-8\nAvenger](/wiki/GAU-8_Avenger \"GAU-8 Avenger\") Gatling gun used in the A10\nThunderbolt II close air support jet. In these applications it allows lighter\nconstruction of the barrels by decreasing chamber pressures through the use of\nlow initial twist rates but ensuring the projectiles have sufficient stability\nonce they leave the barrel. It is seldom used in commercially available\nproducts, though notably on the [Smith & Wesson Model\n460](/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson_Model_460 \"Smith & Wesson Model 460\") (X-treme\nVelocity Revolver).[6]\n\n## Manufacture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Manufacture\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Canon1.JPG/200px-\nCanon1.JPG)](/wiki/File:Canon1.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Canon1.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nRifling in a French 19th century cannon.\n\nFurther information: [internal ballistics](/wiki/Internal_ballistics \"Internal\nballistics\")\n\nAn early method of introducing rifling to a pre-drilled barrel was to use a\ncutter mounted on a square-section rod, accurately twisted into a spiral of\nthe desired pitch, mounted in two fixed square-section holes. As the cutter\nwas advanced through the barrel it twisted at a uniform rate governed by the\npitch. The first cut was shallow but as repeated cuts were made the cutter\npoints were gradually expanded—the blades were in slots in a wooden\n[dowel](/wiki/Dowel \"Dowel\") which were gradually packed out with slips of\npaper—until the required depth was obtained. The process was finished off by\ncasting a [slug](/wiki/Slug_\\(projectile\\) \"Slug \\(projectile\\)\") of molten\nlead into the barrel, withdrawing it and using it with a paste of\n[emery](/wiki/Emery_\\(rock\\) \"Emery \\(rock\\)\") and oil to smooth the bore.[7]\n\nMost rifling is created by either:\n\n  * cutting one groove at a time with a [machine tool](/wiki/Machine_tool \"Machine tool\") (**cut rifling** or **single point cut rifling**);\n  * cutting all grooves in one pass with a special progressive [broaching](/wiki/Broach_\\(metalwork\\) \"Broach \\(metalwork\\)\") bit (**broached rifling**);\n  * [pressing](/wiki/Machine_press \"Machine press\") all grooves at once with a tool called a \"button\" that is pushed or pulled down the barrel (**button rifling**);\n  * [forging](/wiki/Forge \"Forge\") the [barrel](/wiki/Gun_barrel \"Gun barrel\") over a [mandrel](/wiki/Mandrel \"Mandrel\") containing a reverse image of the rifling, and often the chamber as well (**hammer forging**);\n  * [flow forming](/wiki/Shear_forming#Flow_forming \"Shear forming\") the [barrel](/wiki/Gun_barrel \"Gun barrel\") preform over a [mandrel](/wiki/Mandrel \"Mandrel\") containing a reverse image of the rifling (**rifling by flow forming**)\n\nThe _grooves_ are the spaces that are cut out, and the resulting ridges are\ncalled _lands_. These lands and grooves can vary in number, depth, shape,\ndirection of twist (right or left), and twist rate. The spin imparted by\nrifling significantly improves the stability of the projectile, improving both\nrange and accuracy. Typically rifling is a constant rate down the barrel,\nusually measured by the length of travel required to produce a single turn.\nOccasionally firearms are encountered with a _gain twist_ , where the rate of\nspin increases from chamber to muzzle. While intentional gain twists are rare,\ndue to manufacturing variance, a slight gain twist is in fact fairly common.\nSince a reduction in twist rate is very detrimental to accuracy,\n[gunsmiths](/wiki/Gunsmith \"Gunsmith\") who are [machining](/wiki/Machining\n\"Machining\") a new barrel from a rifled blank will often measure the twist\ncarefully so they may put the faster rate, no matter how minute the difference\nis, at the muzzle end.\n\n## Construction and\noperation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Construction and operation\")]\n\nA barrel of circular [bore](/wiki/Gauge_\\(bore_diameter\\) \"Gauge \\(bore\ndiameter\\)\") cross-section is not capable of imparting a spin to a projectile,\nso a rifled barrel has a non-circular cross-section. Typically the rifled\nbarrel contains one or more grooves that run down its length, giving it a\ncross-section resembling an [internal gear](/wiki/Internal_gear \"Internal\ngear\"), though it can also take the shape of a\n[polygon](/wiki/Polygonal_rifling \"Polygonal rifling\"), usually with rounded\ncorners. Since the barrel is not circular in cross-section, it cannot be\naccurately described with a single diameter. Rifled bores may be described by\nthe **bore diameter** (the diameter across the _lands_ or high points in the\nrifling), or by **groove diameter** (the diameter across the _grooves_ or low\npoints in the rifling). Differences in naming conventions for\n[cartridges](/wiki/Cartridge_\\(firearms\\) \"Cartridge \\(firearms\\)\") can cause\nconfusion; for example, the projectiles of the [.303\nBritish](/wiki/.303_British \".303 British\") are actually slightly larger in\ndiameter than the projectiles of the [.308 Winchester](/wiki/.308_Winchester\n\".308 Winchester\"), because the \".303\" refers to the bore diameter in inches\n(bullet is .312), while the \".308\" refers to the bullet diameter in inches\n(7.92 mm and 7.82 mm, respectively).\n\nDespite differences in form, the common goal of rifling is to deliver the\nprojectile accurately to the target. In addition to imparting the spin to the\nbullet, the barrel must hold the projectile securely and concentrically as it\ntravels down the barrel. This requires that the rifling meet a number of\ntasks:[4]\n\n  * It must be sized so that the projectile will [swage](/wiki/Swage \"Swage\") or [obturate](/wiki/Obturate \"Obturate\") upon firing to fill the bore.\n  * The diameter should be consistent, and must not increase towards the muzzle.\n  * The rifling should be consistent down the length of the bore, without changes in cross-section, such as variations in groove width or spacing.\n  * It should be smooth, with no scratches lying perpendicular to the bore, so it does not abrade material from the projectile.\n  * The chamber and crown must smoothly transition the projectile into and out of the rifling.\n\nRifling may not begin immediately forward of the chamber. There may be an\nunrifled throat ahead of the chamber so a cartridge may be chambered without\npushing the bullet into the rifling. This reduces the force required to load a\ncartridge into the chamber, and prevents leaving a bullet stuck in the rifling\nwhen an unfired cartridge is removed from the chamber. The specified diameter\nof the throat may be somewhat greater than groove diameter, and may be\nenlarged by use if hot powder gas melts the interior barrel surface when the\nrifle is fired.[8] [Freebore](/wiki/Freebore \"Freebore\") is a groove-diameter\nlength of [smoothbore](/wiki/Smoothbore \"Smoothbore\") barrel without lands\nforward of the throat. Freebore allows the bullet to transition from [static\nfriction](/wiki/Static_friction \"Static friction\") to sliding friction and\ngain linear [momentum](/wiki/Momentum \"Momentum\") prior to encountering the\nresistance of increasing rotational momentum. Freebore may allow more\neffective use of propellants by reducing the initial pressure peak during the\nminimum volume phase of [internal ballistics](/wiki/Internal_ballistics\n\"Internal ballistics\") before the bullet starts moving down the barrel.\nBarrels with freebore length exceeding the rifled length have been known by a\nvariety of trade names including [paradox](/wiki/Ball_and_shot_gun \"Ball and\nshot gun\").[9]\n\nWhen the projectile is swaged into the rifling, it takes on a mirror image of\nthe rifling, as the lands push into the projectile in a process called\n_engraving_. Engraving takes on not only the major features of the bore, such\nas the lands and grooves, but also minor features, like scratches and tool\nmarks. The relationship between the bore characteristics and the engraving on\nthe projectile are often used in [forensic\nballistics](/wiki/Forensic_ballistics \"Forensic ballistics\").\n\n## Fitting the projectile to the\nbore[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section:\nFitting the projectile to the bore\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/7%2C62x39_bullets_-\n_unfired_and_fired.JPG/220px-7%2C62x39_bullets_-\n_unfired_and_fired.JPG)](/wiki/File:7,62x39_bullets_-_unfired_and_fired.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:7,62x39_bullets_-_unfired_and_fired.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n57-N-231 standard [7.62×39mm](/wiki/7.62%C3%9739mm \"7.62×39mm\") military\nbullets with steel core - the one on the left is unfired, the one on the right\nis fired, with the rifling grooves visible.

Whether\nusing a rifled or smooth bore, a good fit was needed to seal the bore and\nprovide the best possible accuracy from the gun. To ease the force required to\nload the projectile, these early guns used an undersized ball, and a patch\nmade of cloth, paper, or leather to fill the _windage_ (the gap between the\nball and the walls of the bore). The patch provided some degree of sealing,\nkept the ball seated on the charge of [black powder](/wiki/Black_powder \"Black\npowder\"), and kept the ball concentric to the bore. In rifled barrels, the\npatch also provided a means to transfer the spin from the rifling to the\nbullet, as the patch is engraved rather than the ball. Until the advent of the\nhollow-base [Minié ball](/wiki/Mini%C3%A9_ball \"Minié ball\"), which obturates\nupon firing to seal the bore and engage the rifling, the patch provided the\nbest means of getting the projectile to engage the rifling.[10]\n\nIn [breech-loading firearms](/wiki/Breech-loading_weapon \"Breech-loading\nweapon\"), the task of seating the projectile into the rifling is handled by\nthe _throat_ of the [chamber](/wiki/Chamber_\\(firearms\\) \"Chamber\n\\(firearms\\)\"). Next is the _freebore_ , which is the portion of the throat\ndown which the projectile travels before the rifling starts. The last section\nof the throat is the _throat angle_ , where the throat transitions into the\nrifled barrel.\n\nThe throat is usually sized slightly larger than the projectile, so the loaded\ncartridge can be inserted and removed easily, but the throat should be as\nclose as practical to the groove diameter of the barrel. Upon firing, the\nprojectile expands under the pressure from the chamber, and obturates to fit\nthe throat. The bullet then travels down the throat and engages the rifling,\nwhere it is engraved, and begins to spin. Engraving the projectile requires a\nsignificant amount of force, and in some firearms there is a significant\namount of freebore, which helps keep chamber pressures low by allowing the\npropellant gases to expand before being required to engrave the projectile.\nMinimizing freebore improves accuracy by decreasing the chance that a\nprojectile will distort before entering the rifling.[11][12]\n\n## Twist rate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Twist rate\")]\n\nFor best performance, the barrel should have a twist rate sufficient to spin\nstabilize any [bullet](/wiki/Bullet \"Bullet\") that it would reasonably be\nexpected to fire, but not significantly more. Large diameter bullets provide\nmore stability, as the larger radius provides more [gyroscopic\ninertia](/wiki/Angular_momentum \"Angular momentum\"), while long bullets are\nharder to stabilize, as they tend to be very backheavy and the aerodynamic\npressures have a longer arm (\"lever\") to act on. The slowest twist rates are\nfound in [muzzleloading](/wiki/Muzzleloading \"Muzzleloading\") firearms meant\nto fire a round ball; these will have twist rates as low as 1 in 72 inches\n(180 cm), or slightly longer, although for a typical multi-purpose\nmuzzleloader rifle, a twist rate of 1 in 48 inches (120 cm) is very common.\nThe [M16A2](/wiki/M16_rifle \"M16 rifle\") rifle, which is designed to fire the\n[5.56×45mm NATO SS109 ball and L110 tracer](/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO\n\"5.56×45mm NATO\") bullets, has a 1 in 7-inch (18 cm) or 32 calibers twist.\nCivilian [AR-15](/wiki/AR-15 \"AR-15\") rifles are commonly found with 1 in 12\ninches (30 cm) or 54.8 calibers for older rifles and 1 in 9 inches (23 cm) or\n41.1 calibers for most newer rifles, although some are made with 1 in 7 inches\n(18 cm) or 32 calibers twist rates, the same as used for the M16 rifle.\nRifles, which generally fire longer, smaller diameter bullets, will in general\nhave higher twist rates than handguns, which fire shorter, larger diameter\nbullets.\n\n### Expressing twist\nrate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section:\nExpressing twist rate\")]\n\nThere are three methods in use to describe the twist rate:\n\nThe, traditionally speaking, most common method expresses the twist rate in\nterms of the 'travel' (length) required to complete one full projectile\nrevolution in the rifled barrel. This method does not give an easy or\nstraightforward understanding of whether a twist rate is _relatively_ slow or\nfast when bores of different diameters are compared.\n\nThe second method describes the 'rifled travel' required to complete one full\nprojectile revolution in calibers or bore diameters.\n\nT w i s t = L D b o r e {\\displaystyle {Twist}={\\frac {L}{D_{bore}}}}\n![{Twist}={\\\\frac\n{L}{D_{bore}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/540af16dec3415fdd76db9e3457e2d793589b24d)\n\nwhere:\n\n  * Twist = twist rate expressed in bore diameters\n  * L = the twist length required to complete one full projectile revolution (in mm or in)\n  * Dbore = bore diameter (diameter of the lands, in mm or in)\n\nNote that the twist travel L and the bore diameter D must be expressed in a\nconsistent unit of measure, i.e. metric (mm) _or_ imperial (in).\n\nThe third method simply reports the angle of the grooves relative to the bore\naxis, measured in degrees.\n\nNote that the latter two methods have the inherent advantage of expressing\ntwist rate as a ratio and give an easy understanding if a twist rate is\n_relatively_ slow or fast even when comparing bores of differing diameters.\n\n### Twist rate and bullet\nstability[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Twist rate and bullet stability\")]\n\nIn 1879, [George Greenhill](/wiki/George_Greenhill \"George Greenhill\"), a\nprofessor of mathematics at the [Royal Military Academy (RMA) at\nWoolwich](/wiki/Royal_Military_Academy,_Woolwich \"Royal Military Academy,\nWoolwich\"), London, UK[13] developed a [rule of thumb](/wiki/Rule_of_thumb\n\"Rule of thumb\") for calculating the optimal twist rate for lead-core bullets.\nThis shortcut uses the bullet's length, needing no allowances for weight or\nnose shape.[14] The eponymous _Greenhill Formula_ , still used today, is:\n\nT w i s t = C D 2 L × S G 10.9 {\\displaystyle Twist={\\frac {CD^{2}}{L}}\\times\n{\\sqrt {\\frac {SG}{10.9}}}} ![Twist={\\\\frac {CD^{2}}{L}}\\\\times {\\\\sqrt\n{\\\\frac\n{SG}{10.9}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/128bb338b8f07d05dcb71ed2e719e9d6498b96ee)\n\nwhere:\n\n  * C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)\n  * D = bullet's diameter in inches\n  * L = bullet's length in inches\n  * SG = bullet's [specific gravity](/wiki/Specific_gravity \"Specific gravity\") (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)\n\nThe original value of C was 150, which yields a twist rate in inches per turn,\nwhen given the diameter D and the length L of the bullet in inches. This works\nto velocities of about 840 m/s (2800 ft/s); above those velocities, a C of 180\nshould be used. For instance, with a velocity of 600 m/s (2000 ft/s), a\ndiameter of 0.5 inches (13 mm) and a length of 1.5 inches (38 mm), the\nGreenhill formula would give a value of 25, which means 1 turn in 25 inches\n(640 mm).\n\nImproved formulas for determining stability and twist rates include the\n[Miller Twist Rule](/wiki/Miller_Twist_Rule \"Miller Twist Rule\")[15] and the\n[McGyro](/w/index.php?title=McGyro&action=edit&redlink=1 \"McGyro \\(page does\nnot exist\\)\") program[16] developed by Bill Davis and Robert McCoy.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Parrottgun.jpg/220px-\nParrottgun.jpg)](/wiki/File:Parrottgun.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Parrottgun.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [Parrott rifle](/wiki/Parrott_rifle \"Parrott rifle\"), used by both\n[Confederate](/wiki/Confederate_States_Army \"Confederate States Army\") and\n[Union](/wiki/Union_Army \"Union Army\") forces in the [American Civil\nWar](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\").\n\nIf an insufficient twist rate is used, the bullet will begin to\n[yaw](/wiki/Yaw_angle \"Yaw angle\") and then tumble; this is usually seen as\n\"keyholing\", where bullets leave elongated holes in the target as they strike\nat an angle. Once the bullet starts to yaw, any hope of accuracy is lost, as\nthe bullet will begin to veer off in random directions as it\n[precesses](/wiki/Precession \"Precession\").\n\nConversely, too-high a rate of twist can also cause problems. The excessive\ntwist can cause accelerated barrel wear, and coupled with high velocities also\ninduce a very high spin rate which can cause projectile\n[jacket](/wiki/Bullet#Materials \"Bullet\") ruptures causing high velocity spin\nstabilized projectiles to disintegrate in flight. Projectiles made out of mono\nmetals cannot practically achieve flight and spin velocities such that they\ndisintegrate in flight due to their spin rate.[17] [Smokeless\npowder](/wiki/Smokeless_powder \"Smokeless powder\") can produce muzzle\nvelocities of approximately 1,600 m/s (5,200 ft/s) for spin stabilized\nprojectiles and more advanced propellants used in\n[smoothbore](/wiki/Smoothbore \"Smoothbore\") tank guns can produce muzzle\nvelocities of approximately 1,800 m/s (5,900 ft/s).[18] A higher twist than\nneeded can also cause more subtle problems with accuracy: Any inconsistency\nwithin the bullet, such as a void that causes an unequal distribution of mass,\nmay be magnified by the spin. Undersized bullets also have problems, as they\nmay not enter the rifling exactly [concentric](/wiki/Concentric \"Concentric\")\nand [coaxial](/wiki/Coaxial \"Coaxial\") to the bore, and excess twist will\nexacerbate the accuracy problems this causes.\n\n### Bullet spin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Bullet spin\")]\n\nA bullet fired from a rifled barrel can spin at over 300,000\n[rpm](/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute \"Revolutions per minute\") (5\n[kHz](/wiki/KHz \"KHz\")), depending on the bullet's [muzzle\nvelocity](/wiki/Muzzle_velocity \"Muzzle velocity\") and the barrel's [twist\nrate](/wiki/Twist_rate \"Twist rate\").\n\nThe general definition of the spin  S {\\displaystyle S}\n![S](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2)\nof an object rotating around a single axis can be written as\n\n     S = υ C {\\displaystyle S={\\frac {\\upsilon }{C}}} ![S={\\\\frac {\\\\upsilon }{C}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a350df1c08ef00b6618e58b1afc67d4caae4d5f0)\n\nwhere  υ {\\displaystyle \\upsilon } ![\\\\upsilon\n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3d9773c30e2bda2ecb0af8fa63f9e0e537f0fc4)\nis the linear [velocity](/wiki/Velocity \"Velocity\") of a point in the rotating\nobject (in units of distance/time) and  C {\\displaystyle C}\n![C](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029)\nrefers to the circumference of the circle that this measuring point performs\naround the axis of rotation.\n\nA bullet that matches the rifling of the firing barrel will exit that barrel\nwith a spin\n\n     S = υ 0 L {\\displaystyle S={\\frac {\\upsilon _{0}}{L}}} ![S={\\\\frac {\\\\upsilon _{0}}{L}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8c261b7ec111ef587195f05dbe9a9ee7e46fd45)\n\nwhere  υ 0 {\\displaystyle \\upsilon _{0}} ![\\\\upsilon\n_{0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f6b307d204d11920706effce2334268af4383fa5)\nis the muzzle velocity and  L {\\displaystyle L}\n![L](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8)\nis the twist rate.[19]\n\nFor example, an M4 Carbine with a twist rate of 1 in 7 inches (177.8 mm) and a\nmuzzle velocity of 3,050 feet per second (930 m/s) will give the bullet a spin\nof 930 m/s / 0.1778 m = 5.2 kHz (314,000 rpm).\n\nExcessive rotational speed can exceed the bullet's designed limits and the\nresulting centrifugal force can cause the bullet to disintegrate radially\nduring flight.[20]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle \"Rifle\")\n  * [Smoothbore](/wiki/Smoothbore \"Smoothbore\")\n  * [Paradox gun](/wiki/Paradox_gun \"Paradox gun\")\n  * [Comparison microscope](/wiki/Comparison_microscope \"Comparison microscope\")\n\n|\n\n  * [Gun barrel sequence (James Bond)](/wiki/Gun_barrel_sequence_\\(James_Bond\\) \"Gun barrel sequence \\(James Bond\\)\")\n  * [Greenhill formula](/wiki/Greenhill_formula \"Greenhill formula\")\n  * [Glossary of firearms terminology](/wiki/Glossary_of_firearms_terminology \"Glossary of firearms terminology\")\n  * [Miller twist rate](/wiki/Miller_twist_rate \"Miller twist rate\")\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rifling&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Randy D.
