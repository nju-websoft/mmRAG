The tower is situated behind the [Pisa\nCathedral](/wiki/Pisa_Cathedral \"Pisa Cathedral\") and is the third oldest\nstructure in the city's Cathedral Square (_[Piazza del\nDuomo](/wiki/Piazza_del_Duomo,_Pisa \"Piazza del Duomo, Pisa\")_), after the\ncathedral and the [Pisa Baptistry](/wiki/Pisa_Baptistry \"Pisa Baptistry\").\n\nThe tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an\ninadequate [foundation](/wiki/Foundation_\\(engineering\\) \"Foundation\n\\(engineering\\)\") on ground too soft on one side to properly support the\nstructure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was\ncompleted in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was\nstabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and\nearly 21st centuries.\n\nThe height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the\nlow side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the\nwalls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500\n[metric tons](/wiki/Tonne \"Tonne\") (16,000 [short tons](/wiki/Short_ton \"Short\nton\")).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer\nsteps on the north-facing staircase. Prior to restoration work performed\nbetween 1990 and 2001, the tower leaned at an angle of 5.5 degrees,[2][3][4]\nbut the tower now leans at about 3.99 degrees.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Architect\n  * 2 Construction\n    * 2.1 Timeline\n    * 2.2 Builders\n  * 3 History following construction\n  * 4 Guinness World Records\n  * 5 Technical information\n  * 6 Gallery\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Architect\n\nThere has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the\nLeaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo\nand [Bonanno Pisano](/wiki/Bonanno_Pisano \"Bonanno Pisano\"),[6] a well-known\n12th-century resident artist of Pisa, famous for his [bronze](/wiki/Bronze\n\"Bronze\") casting, particularly in the [Pisa Duomo](/wiki/Piazza_dei_Miracoli\n\"Piazza dei Miracoli\"). Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for [Monreale](/wiki/Monreale\n\"Monreale\"), Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of\ncast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but\nthis may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was\ndestroyed in 1595. A 2001 study[7] seems to indicate\n[Diotisalvi](/wiki/Diotisalvi \"Diotisalvi\") was the original architect, due to\nthe time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the\nbell tower of [San Nicola](/wiki/San_Nicola,_Pisa \"San Nicola, Pisa\") and the\n[Baptistery](/wiki/Baptistery \"Baptistery\"), both in Pisa.\n\n## Construction\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Pisa_Cathedral_%26_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa.jpg/220px-\nPisa_Cathedral_%26_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pisa_Cathedral_%26_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pisa_Cathedral_%26_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Pisa Baptistery](/wiki/Pisa_Baptistery \"Pisa Baptistery\") (in the\nforeground), the [Pisa Cathedral](/wiki/Pisa_Cathedral \"Pisa Cathedral\") (in\nthe middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Leaning_tower_of_pisa_2.jpg/170px-\nLeaning_tower_of_pisa_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Leaning_tower_of_pisa_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Leaning_tower_of_pisa_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLeaning Tower of Pisa in 2004\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa%2C_Italy.jpg/170px-\nLeaning_Tower_of_Pisa%2C_Italy.jpg)](/wiki/File:Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa,_Italy.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa,_Italy.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLeaning Tower of Pisa\n\nConstruction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. Work on the\nground floor of the white marble campanile began on August 14, 1173 during a\nperiod of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a [blind\narcade](/wiki/Blind_arcade \"Blind arcade\") articulated by engaged columns with\nclassical Corinthian [capitals](/wiki/Capital_\\(architecture\\) \"Capital\n\\(architecture\\)\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor\nin 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable\n[subsoil](/wiki/Subsoil \"Subsoil\"), a design that was flawed from the\nbeginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, because\nthe [Republic of Pisa](/wiki/Republic_of_Pisa \"Republic of Pisa\") was almost\ncontinually engaged in battles with [Genoa](/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa \"Republic\nof Genoa\"), [Lucca](/wiki/Republic_of_Lucca \"Republic of Lucca\"), and\n[Florence](/wiki/Florence \"Florence\"). This allowed time for the underlying\nsoil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have\ntoppled.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In 1198, clocks were temporarily installed on\nthe third floor of the unfinished construction.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn 1272, construction resumed under [Giovanni di\nSimone](/w/index.php?title=Giovanni_di_Simone&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Giovanni\ndi Simone \\(page does not exist\\)\"), architect of the\n[Camposanto](/wiki/Piazza_dei_Miracoli#Camposanto \"Piazza dei Miracoli\"). In\nan effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with\none side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[8]\nConstruction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the\nGenoans in the [Battle of Meloria](/wiki/Battle_of_Meloria_\\(1284\\) \"Battle of\nMeloria \\(1284\\)\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe seventh floor was completed in 1319. The bell-chamber was finally added in\n1372. It was built by [Tommaso di Andrea\nPisano](/w/index.php?title=Tommaso_di_Andrea_Pisano&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Tommaso di Andrea Pisano \\(page does not exist\\)\"), who succeeded in\nharmonizing the [Gothic](/wiki/Gothic_architecture \"Gothic architecture\")\nelements of the bell-chamber with the\n[Romanesque](/wiki/Romanesque_architecture \"Romanesque architecture\") style of\nthe tower.[9] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major\nscale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAfter a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[10] the tower is\ncurrently undergoing gradual surface restoration, in order to repair visible\ndamage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due\nto the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[11]\n\n### Timeline\n\n  * On January 5, 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty [soldi](/wiki/Solidus_\\(coin\\) \"Solidus \\(coin\\)\") to the _Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie_. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[12]\n  * On August 9, 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.\n  * Nearly four centuries later [Giorgio Vasari](/wiki/Giorgio_Vasari \"Giorgio Vasari\") wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in [this] year 1174 with Bonanno as sculptor, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa.\"\n  * On December 27, 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the construction of the bell tower.[13]\n  * On February 23, 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni, a worker on the cathedral Santa Maria Maggiore, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[14]\n  * On April 12, 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[15]\n  * Giorgio Vasari indicated that Tommaso di Andrea Pisano was the designer of the belfry[16] between 1360 and 1370.\n\n### Builders\n\n  * One possible known builder of Pisa Tower was [Gerardo di Gerardo](/w/index.php?title=Gerardo_di_Gerardo&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Gerardo di Gerardo \\(page does not exist\\)\"). His name appears as a witness to the above legacy of Berta di Bernardo as \"Master Gerardo\", and as a worker whose name was Gerardo.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n  * A more probable builder was Diotisalvi, because of the construction period and the structure's affinities with other buildings in Pisa, but he usually signed his works, and there is no signature by him in the bell tower.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n  * Giovanni di Simone was known to be heavily involved in the completion of the tower, under the direction of [Giovanni Pisano](/wiki/Giovanni_Pisano \"Giovanni Pisano\"), who at the time was master builder of the [Opera di Santa Maria Maggiore](/w/index.php?title=Opera_di_Santa_Maria_Maggiore&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Opera di Santa Maria Maggiore \\(page does not exist\\)\"). Di Simone could be the same Giovanni Pisano who completed the belfry tower.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## History following construction\n\n[Galileo Galilei](/wiki/Galileo_Galilei \"Galileo Galilei\") is said to have\n[dropped two cannonballs](/wiki/Galileo%27s_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_experiment\n\"Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment\") of different [masses](/wiki/Mass\n\"Mass\") from the tower to demonstrate that their [speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\")\nof descent was independent of their mass. However, the only primary source for\nthis is the biography _Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei\n(Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei)_ , written by Galileo's\nsecretary [Vincenzo Viviani](/wiki/Vincenzo_Viviani \"Vincenzo Viviani\") and\npublished in 1717, long after Viviani's death.[17][18]\n\nDuring [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), the\n[Allies](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II \"Allies of World War II\") suspected that\nthe Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A [U.S.\nArmy](/wiki/U.S._Army \"U.S. Army\") [sergeant](/wiki/Sergeant \"Sergeant\") sent\nto confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the\nbeauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an\n[artillery](/wiki/Artillery \"Artillery\") strike, sparing it from\ndestruction.[19][20]\n\nNumerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation\nor at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some\nworsened the tilt. On February 27, 1964, the government of Italy requested aid\nin preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important\nto retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in\npromoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[21]\n\nA multinational [task force](/wiki/Task_force \"Task force\") of engineers,\nmathematicians, and historians gathered on the [Azores](/wiki/Azores \"Azores\")\nislands to discuss stabilisation methods. It was found that the tilt was\nincreasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many\nmethods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800\ntonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[22]\n\nThe tower and the neighbouring [cathedral](/wiki/Cathedral \"Cathedral\"),\n[baptistery](/wiki/Baptistery \"Baptistery\"), and cemetery are included in the\n[Piazza del Duomo](/wiki/Piazza_del_Duomo,_Pisa \"Piazza del Duomo, Pisa\")\n[UNESCO World Heritage Site](/wiki/World_Heritage_Site \"World Heritage Site\"),\nwhich was declared in 1987.[23]\n\nThe tower was closed to the public on January 7, 1990, after more than two\ndecades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the\n[Civic Tower of Pavia](/wiki/Civic_Tower_\\(Pavia\\) \"Civic Tower \\(Pavia\\)\") in\n1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight, and cables were cinched\naround the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments\nand houses in the path of the tower were vacated for safety. The solution\nchosen to prevent the collapse of the tower was to slightly straighten it to a\nsafer angle by removing 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) of soil from\nunderneath the raised end. The tower was straightened by 45 centimetres (17.7\ninches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective\nreconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public\non December 15, 2001 and was declared stable for at least another 300\nyears.[22] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of earth were removed.[24]\n\nIn May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that\nit had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it\nwould be stable for at least 200 years.[24]\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Plaque_galileo.jpg/400px-Plaque_galileo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Plaque_galileo.jpg)\n\nPlaque in memory of [Galileo Galilei](/wiki/Galileo_Galilei \"Galileo\nGalilei\")'s experiments\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Pisa_schiefer_turm_gewichte_1998_01.jpg/400px-Pisa_schiefer_turm_gewichte_1998_01.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pisa_schiefer_turm_gewichte_1998_01.jpg)\n\nLead counterweights, 1998\n\n## Guinness World Records\n\nTwo German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most\nlop-sided building: the 15th-century square [Leaning Tower of\nSuurhusen](/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Suurhusen \"Leaning Tower of Suurhusen\") and\nthe 14th-century bell tower in the town of [Bad\nFrankenhausen](/wiki/Bad_Frankenhausen#Sights \"Bad Frankenhausen\").[25]\n_[Guinness World Records](/wiki/Guinness_World_Records \"Guinness World\nRecords\")_ measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt\nto be 3.97 degrees.[26] In June 2010, _Guinness World Records_ certified the\n[Capital Gate](/wiki/Capital_Gate \"Capital Gate\") building in [Abu\nDhabi](/wiki/Abu_Dhabi \"Abu Dhabi\"), [UAE](/wiki/UAE \"UAE\") as the \"World's\nFurthest Leaning Man-made Tower\".[27] The Capital Gate tower has an 18-degree\nslope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower; however the Capital Gate\ntower has been deliberately engineered to slant.

The siting of the campanile within the\nPiazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and\nbaptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.\n\n## Gallery\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Lightmatter_pisa.jpg/200px-Lightmatter_pisa.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lightmatter_pisa.jpg)\n\nView looking up\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Leaning_tower_door.JPG/225px-Leaning_tower_door.JPG)](/wiki/File:Leaning_tower_door.JPG)\n\nEntrance door to the bell tower\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Leaning_tower_loggiati.jpg/225px-Leaning_tower_loggiati.jpg)](/wiki/File:Leaning_tower_loggiati.jpg)\n\nExternal [loggia](/wiki/Loggia \"Loggia\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Leaning_tower_staircase_6th_floor.jpg/225px-Leaning_tower_staircase_6th_floor.jpg)](/wiki/File:Leaning_tower_staircase_6th_floor.jpg)\n\nInner staircase from sixth to seventh floor\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Leaning_tower_staircase_7th_floor.JPG/400px-Leaning_tower_staircase_7th_floor.JPG)](/wiki/File:Leaning_tower_staircase_7th_floor.JPG)\n\nInner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Leaning_tower_staircase_8th_floor.JPG/400px-Leaning_tower_staircase_8th_floor.JPG)](/wiki/File:Leaning_tower_staircase_8th_floor.JPG)\n\nView from the top\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Leaning_tower_bell_assunta.JPG/225px-Leaning_tower_bell_assunta.JPG)](/wiki/File:Leaning_tower_bell_assunta.JPG)\n\n_Assunta_ bell\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Leaning_tower_bell_Pasquareccia.JPG/225px-Leaning_tower_bell_Pasquareccia.JPG)](/wiki/File:Leaning_tower_bell_Pasquareccia.JPG)\n\n_Pasquareccia_ bell\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/View%2C_looking_down_from_top_of_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa.jpg/140px-View%2C_looking_down_from_top_of_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa.jpg)](/wiki/File:View,_looking_down_from_top_of_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa.jpg)\n\nView, looking down from the top\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Tower_of_Pisa_-_push.jpg/225px-Tower_of_Pisa_-_push.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tower_of_Pisa_-_push.jpg)\n\nTourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Leaning Temple of Huma](/wiki/Leaning_Temple_of_Huma \"Leaning Temple of Huma\")—Only leaning temple in the world\n  * [List of leaning towers](/wiki/List_of_leaning_towers \"List of leaning towers\")\n    * [Leaning Tower of Niles](/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Niles \"Leaning Tower of Niles\"), a replica of the Tower of Pisa\n    * [Leaning Tower of Zaragoza](/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Zaragoza \"Leaning Tower of Zaragoza\"), was a famous European leaning tower\n    * [Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul)](/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_al-Nuri_\\(Mosul\\) \"Great Mosque of al-Nuri \\(Mosul\\)\"), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017\n  * [Machang, Kelantan](/wiki/Machang,_Kelantan \"Machang, Kelantan\")—home to another leaning tower\n  * [Round tower (disambiguation)](/wiki/Round_tower_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Round tower \\(disambiguation\\)\"), for other types of round towers\n  * [The Greyfriars Tower](/wiki/List_of_buildings_in_King%27s_Lynn#Greyfriars_Tower \"List of buildings in King's Lynn\")—the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\"\n  * [Torre delle Milizie](/wiki/Torre_delle_Milizie \"Torre delle Milizie\"), a tilting medieval tower in Rome\n  * [Tour de Pise](/wiki/Tour_de_Pise \"Tour de Pise\"), a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\"](http://www.towerofpisa.info/Tower-of-Pisa-facts.html).
