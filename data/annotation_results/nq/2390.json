These groups often\ndisagree on the interpretation of laws and court cases related to firearms as\nwell as about the effects of firearms regulation on crime and public\nsafety.[1]:7 It has been estimated that [U.S. civilians own 270 million to 310\nmillion firearms](/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country\n\"Estimated number of guns per capita by country\"), and that 35% to 42% of the\nhouseholds in the country have at least one gun.[2][3]\n\nSince the mid-1990s, debates regarding firearm availability and gun violence\nin the United States have been characterized by concerns about the right to\nbear arms, such as found in the [Second Amendment to the U.S.\nConstitution](/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_U.S._Constitution \"Second\nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution\"), and the responsibility of the [United\nStates government](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal\ngovernment of the United States\") to serve the needs of its citizens and to\nprevent [crime and deaths](/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States \"Gun\nviolence in the United States\"). Firearms regulation supporters say that\nindiscriminate or unrestricted gun rights inhibit the government from\nfulfilling that responsibility, and causes a safety concern, as [assault\nweapons](/wiki/Assault_weapons \"Assault weapons\") are legal.[4][5][6]:1–3[7]\nGun rights supporters promote firearms for [self-defense](/wiki/Self-\ndefense#Armed \"Self-defense\"), [hunting](/wiki/Hunting#Shooting \"Hunting\"),\n[sporting activities](/wiki/Shooting_sport \"Shooting sport\"), and security\nagainst tyranny.[8]:96[9] Firearms regulation advocates state that restricting\nand tracking gun access would result in safer communities, while gun rights\nadvocates state that increased firearm ownership by law-abiding citizens\nreduces crime and assert that criminals have always had easy access to\nfirearms.[10][11]\n\nGun legislation, or non-legislation, in the United States is augmented by\njudicial interpretations of the Constitution. In 1791, the United States\nadopted the Second Amendment, and in 1868 adopted the [Fourteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"). The effect of those\ntwo amendments on gun politics was the subject of landmark [U.S. Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United\nStates\") decisions in 2008 and 2010, that upheld the right of individuals to\npossess guns for self-defense.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Colonial era through the Civil War\n    * 1.2 Post Civil War\n    * 1.3 20th century\n      * 1.3.1 First half of 20th century\n        * 1.3.1.1 National Firearms Act\n        * 1.3.1.2 _United States v.

A connection between shooting skills and survival among rural\nAmerican men was in many cases a necessity and a '[rite of\npassage](/wiki/Rite_of_passage \"Rite of passage\")' for those entering\nmanhood.[1]:9 Today, hunting survives as a central sentimental component of a\ngun culture as a way to control animal populations across the country,\nregardless of modern trends away from subsistence hunting and rural living.[7]\n\nPrior to the [American Revolution](/wiki/American_Revolution \"American\nRevolution\") there was neither budget nor manpower nor government desire to\nmaintain a full-time army. Therefore, the armed citizen-soldier carried the\nresponsibility. Service in militia, including providing one's own ammunition\nand weapons, was mandatory for all men. Yet, as early as the 1790s, the\nmandatory universal militia duty evolved gradually to voluntary militia units\nand a reliance on a [regular army](/wiki/Regular_army \"Regular army\").\nThroughout the 19th century the institution of the organized civilian militia\nbegan to decline.[1]:10 The unorganized civilian militia, however, still\nremains even in current U.S. law, consisting of essentially everyone from age\n17 to 45, while also including former military officers up to age 64, as\ncodified in [10 U.S.C.](/wiki/Title_10_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 10 of\nthe United States Code\") [§\n246](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246).\n\nClosely related to the militia tradition is the frontier tradition, with the\nneed for self-protection pursuant to westward expansion and the extension of\nthe [American frontier](/wiki/American_frontier \"American frontier\").[1]:10–11\nThough it has not been a necessary part of daily survival for over a century,\n\"generations of Americans continued to embrace and glorify it as a living\ninheritance—as a permanent ingredient of this nation's style and\nculture\".[12]:21\n\n### Colonial era through the Civil\nWar[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_politics_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Colonial era through the Civil War\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Minute_Man_Statue_Lexington_Massachusetts_cropped.jpg/170px-\nMinute_Man_Statue_Lexington_Massachusetts_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:Minute_Man_Statue_Lexington_Massachusetts_cropped.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Minute_Man_Statue_Lexington_Massachusetts_cropped.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGun politics date to Colonial America.

Two direct attempts to\ndisarm the colonial militias fanned what had been a smoldering resentment of\nBritish interference into the fires of war.[15]\n\nThese two incidents were the attempt to confiscate the cannon of the Concord\nand Lexington militias, leading to the [Battles of Lexington and\nConcord](/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord \"Battles of Lexington and\nConcord\") of April 19, 1775, and the attempt, on April 20, to confiscate\nmilitia powder stores in the armory of Williamsburg, Virginia, which led to\nthe [Gunpowder Incident](/wiki/Gunpowder_Incident \"Gunpowder Incident\") and a\nface off between [Patrick Henry](/wiki/Patrick_Henry \"Patrick Henry\") and\nhundreds of militia members on one side and the Royal Governor of Virginia,\nLord Dunmore, and British seamen on the other. The Gunpowder Incident was\neventually settled by paying the colonists for the powder.[15]\n\nAccording to historian [Saul Cornell](/wiki/Saul_Cornell \"Saul Cornell\"),\nstates passed some of the first gun control laws, beginning with Kentucky's\nlaw to \"curb the practice of carrying concealed weapons in 1813.\" There was\nopposition and, as a result, the [individual\nright](/wiki/Individual_and_group_rights \"Individual and group rights\")\ninterpretation of the Second Amendment began and grew in direct response to\nthese early gun control laws, in keeping with this new \"pervasive spirit of\nindividualism.\" As noted by Cornell, \"Ironically, the first gun control\nmovement helped give birth to the first self-conscious gun rights ideology\nbuilt around a constitutional right of individual self-defense.\"[16]:140–141\n\nThe individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment first arose in\n_[Bliss v. Commonwealth](/wiki/Firearm_case_law_in_the_United_States#Bliss\n\"Firearm case law in the United States\")_ (1822),[17] which evaluated the\nright to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state pursuant to Section\n28 of the Second Constitution of [Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky \"Kentucky\") (1799).\nThe right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state was interpreted\nas an individual right, for the case of a concealed sword cane. This case has\nbeen described as about \"a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed\nweapons [that] was violative of the Second Amendment\".[18]\n\nThe first state court decision relevant to the \"right to bear arms\" issue was\n_Bliss v. Commonwealth_. The Kentucky court held that \"the right of citizens\nto bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved\nentire,...\"[19]:161[20]\n\nAlso during the Jacksonian Era, the first [collective\nright](/wiki/Individual_and_group_rights \"Individual and group rights\") (or\ngroup right) interpretation of the Second Amendment arose. In _[State v.\nBuzzard](/wiki/Firearm_case_law_in_the_United_States#Buzzard \"Firearm case law\nin the United States\")_ (1842), the Arkansas high court adopted a militia-\nbased, political right, reading of the right to bear arms under state law, and\nupheld the 21st section of the second article of the Arkansas Constitution\nthat declared, \"that the free white men of this State shall have a right to\nkeep and bear arms for their common defense\",[21] while rejecting a challenge\nto a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons.\n\nThe Arkansas high court declared \"That the words 'a well regulated militia\nbeing necessary for the security of a free State', and the words 'common\ndefense' clearly show the true intent and meaning of these Constitutions\n[i.e., Arkansas and U.S.] and prove that it is a political and not an\nindividual right, and, of course, that the State, in her legislative capacity,\nhas the right to regulate and control it: This being the case, then the\npeople, neither individually nor collectively, have the right to keep and bear\narms.\" [Joel Prentiss Bishop](/wiki/Joel_Prentiss_Bishop \"Joel Prentiss\nBishop\")'s influential _Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes_ (1873)\ntook Buzzard's militia-based interpretation, a view that Bishop characterized\nas the \"Arkansas doctrine,\" as the orthodox view of the right to bear arms in\nAmerican law.[21][22]\n\nThe two early state court cases, _Bliss_ and _Buzzard_ , set the fundamental\ndichotomy in interpreting the Second Amendment, i.e., whether it secured an\nindividual right versus a collective right.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nSee also: [Reconstruction era](/wiki/Reconstruction_era \"Reconstruction era\")\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-\nclear.svg.png)| This section may **require[cleanup](/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup\n\"Wikipedia:Cleanup\")** to meet Wikipedia's [quality\nstandards](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style\").

Bingham](/wiki/John_Bingham \"John Bingham\") of\n[Ohio](/wiki/Ohio \"Ohio\") used the Court's own phrase \"privileges and\nimmunities of citizens\" to include the first Eight Amendments of the Bill of\nRights under its protection and guard these rights against state\nlegislation.[23]\n\nThe debate in the Congress on the Fourteenth Amendment after the Civil War\nalso concentrated on what the Southern States were doing to harm the newly\nfreed slaves.

Points were deducted from states with laws that expanded\naccess to guns, allowed concealed carry in public areas particularly schools\nand bars without a permit or passed \"Stand Your Ground Laws\" — which remove\nthe duty to retreat and allow people to shoot potential assailants.\nEventually, states were graded indicating the overall strengths or weakness of\ngun laws.

Heller_ (2008). The Court stated: \"By the time of the founding,\nthe right to have arms had become fundamental for English subjects.\"[124] The\nCourt observed that the [English Bill of Rights of\n1689](/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689 \"Bill of Rights 1689\") had listed a right to\narms as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen. However, it should be\nnoted that human rights law neither recognizes a right to firearms nor a human\nright to self-defense, but requires states instead to reasonably regulate and\nrestrict the possession and use of firearms to protect the right to life.[125]\n\nWhen the Court interpreted the [Fourteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") in _[McDonald v.\nCity of Chicago](/wiki/McDonald_v._City_of_Chicago \"McDonald v. City of\nChicago\")_ (2010), it looked to the year 1868, when the amendment was\nratified, and said that most states had provisions in their constitutions\nexplicitly protecting this right. The Court concluded: \"It is clear that the\nFramers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep\nand bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of\nordered liberty.\"[126][127]\n\n#### Second Amendment\nrights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_politics_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Second Amendment rights\")]\n\nThe Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted on December\n15, 1791, states:\n\n> A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,\n> the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.[128]\n\nPrior to _District of Columbia v. Heller_ , in the absence of a clear court\nruling, there was debate about whether or not the Second Amendment included an\n[individual right](/wiki/Individual_and_group_rights \"Individual and group\nrights\").[129] In _Heller_ , the Court concluded that there is indeed such a\nright, but not an unlimited one.[129] Although the decision was not unanimous,\nall justices endorsed an individual right viewpoint, but differed on the scope\nof that right.[66][67]\n\nBefore _Heller_ gun rights advocates argued that the Second Amendment protects\nan individual right to own guns. They stated that the phrase \"the people\" in\nthat amendment applies to individuals rather than an organized collective, and\nthat the phrase \"the people\" means the same thing in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th,\nand 10th Amendments.[130]:55–87[131][132] They also said the Second's\nplacement in the [Bill of Rights](/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights \"United\nStates Bill of Rights\") defines it as an individual right.[133][134] As part\nof the _Heller_ decision, the majority endorsed the view that the Second\nAmendment protects an individual, not unlimited, right to own guns. [Political\nscientist](/wiki/Political_scientist \"Political scientist\") [Robert\nSpitzer](/wiki/Robert_Spitzer_\\(political_scientist\\) \"Robert Spitzer\n\\(political scientist\\)\") and Supreme Court law clerk [Gregory P.\nMagarian](/wiki/Gregory_P._Magarian \"Gregory P.

In 2010 in the case\nof _[McDonald v. City Chicago](/wiki/McDonald_v._City_of_Chicago \"McDonald v.\nCity of Chicago\")_ , the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment's\nprovisions do apply to the states as a result of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n#### Defense of self and\nstate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_politics_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Defense of self and state\")]\n\nThe eighteenth-century English jurist [William\nBlackstone](/wiki/William_Blackstone \"William Blackstone\") (b. 1723), whose\nwritings influenced the drafters of the U.S. Constitution,[138] called [self-\ndefense](/wiki/Self-defense \"Self-defense\") \"the primary law of nature\" which\n(he said) man-made law cannot take away.[139] Following Blackstone, the\nAmerican jurist [St. George Tucker](/wiki/St._George_Tucker \"St. George\nTucker\") (b. 1752) wrote that \"the right of self-defense is the first law of\nnature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this\nright within the narrowest limits possible.\"[140]\n\nIn both _Heller_ (2008) and _McDonald_ (2010) the Supreme Court deemed that\nthe right of self-defense is at least partly protected by the United States\nConstitution. The court left details of that protection to be worked out in\nfuture court cases.[141]\n\nThe two primary interest groups regarding this issue are the Brady Campaign\nand the National Rifle Association.[142] They have clashed, for example,\nregarding [stand-your-ground laws](/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law \"Stand-your-\nground law\") which give individuals a legal right to use guns for defending\nthemselves without any [duty to retreat](/wiki/Duty_to_retreat \"Duty to\nretreat\") from a dangerous situation.[143] After the Supreme Court's 2008\ndecision in _Heller_ , the Brady Campaign indicated that it would seek\nreasonable gun laws \"without infringing on the right of law-abiding persons to\npossess guns for self-defense.\"[144]\n\n#### Security against\ntyranny[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_politics_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Security against tyranny\")]\n\nAnother fundamental political argument associated with the right to keep and\nbear arms is that banning or even regulating gun ownership makes government\n[tyranny](/wiki/Tyranny \"Tyranny\") more likely.[145] A January 2013 [Rasmussen\nReports](/wiki/Rasmussen_Reports \"Rasmussen Reports\") poll indicated that 65\npercent of Americans believe the purpose of the Second Amendment is to \"ensure\nthat people are able to protect themselves from tyranny.\"[146] A [Gallup\npoll](/wiki/Gallup_\\(company\\) \"Gallup \\(company\\)\") in October 2013 showed\nthat 60 percent of American gun owners mention \"personal safety/protection\" as\na reason for owning them, and 5 percent mention a \"Second Amendment right,\"\namong other reasons.[147] The anti-tyranny argument extends back to the days\nof colonial America and earlier in Great Britain.[148]\n\nVarious gun rights advocates and organizations, such as former governor [Mike\nHuckabee](/wiki/Mike_Huckabee \"Mike Huckabee\"),[149] former Congressman [Ron\nPaul](/wiki/Ron_Paul \"Ron Paul\"),[150] and Gun Owners of America,[9] say that\nan armed citizenry is the population's last line of defense against tyranny by\ntheir own government. This belief was also familiar at the time the\nConstitution was written.[151][152]\n\nA [right of revolution](/wiki/Right_of_revolution \"Right of revolution\") was\nomitted from the Constitution, and instead the Constitution was designed to\nensure a government deriving its power from the [consent of the\ngoverned](/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed \"Consent of the governed\").[153]\n\nGun rights advocates such as [Stephen Halbrook](/wiki/Stephen_Halbrook\n\"Stephen Halbrook\") and [Wayne LaPierre](/wiki/Wayne_LaPierre \"Wayne\nLaPierre\") support the \"[Nazi gun control](/wiki/Nazi_gun_control \"Nazi gun\ncontrol\")\" theory. The theory states that gun regulations enforced by the\n[Third Reich](/wiki/Third_Reich \"Third Reich\") rendered victims of [the\nHolocaust](/wiki/The_Holocaust \"The Holocaust\") weak, and that more effective\nresistance to oppression would have been possible if they had been better\narmed.[154]:484[155]:87–8,167–8 Other [authoritarian\nregimes](/wiki/Authoritarianism \"Authoritarianism\") gun laws have also been\nbrought up. This [counterfactual history](/wiki/Counterfactual_history\n\"Counterfactual history\") theory is not supported by mainstream\nscholarship,[156]:412,414[157]:671,677[158]:728 though it is an element of a\n\"security against tyranny\" argument in U.S. politics.[159]__\n\nThe [Declaration of\nIndependence](/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence \"United States\nDeclaration of Independence\") mentions \"the Right of the People to alter or to\nabolish\" the government, and [Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham\nLincoln\")'s first [inaugural address](/wiki/Inauguration \"Inauguration\")\nreiterated the \"revolutionary right\" of the people.[160] In 1957, the legal\nscholar [Roscoe Pound](/wiki/Roscoe_Pound \"Roscoe Pound\") expressed a\ndifferent view:[161][162] He stated, \"A legal right of the citizen to wage war\non the government is something that cannot be admitted. ... In the urban\nindustrial society of today a general right to bear efficient arms so as to be\nenabled to resist oppression by the government would mean that gangs could\nexercise an extra-legal rule which would defeat the whole Bill of Rights.\"\n\nHistorian [Don Higginbotham](/wiki/Don_Higginbotham \"Don Higginbotham\") wrote\nthat the well-regulated militia protected by the Second Amendment was more\nlikely to put down rebellions than participate in them.[163] American gun\nrights activist [Larry Pratt](/wiki/Larry_Pratt \"Larry Pratt\") says that the\nanti-tyranny argument for gun rights is supported by successful efforts in\nGuatemala and the Philippines to arm ordinary citizens against communist\ninsurgency in the 1980s.[164][165] Gun-rights advocacy groups argue that the\nonly way to enforce democracy is through having the means of\nresistance.[130]:55–87[131][132] Militia-movement groups cite the [Battle of\nAthens](/wiki/Battle_of_Athens_\\(1946\\) \"Battle of Athens \\(1946\\)\")\n(Tennessee, 1946) as an example of citizens who \"[used] armed force to support\nthe Rule of Law\" in what they said was a [rigged county\nelection](/wiki/Electoral_fraud \"Electoral fraud\").[166] Then-senator [John F.\nKennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John F.

After the tragedy of Sandy Hook, the majority of people, including\ngun owners and non-gun owners, wanted the government to spend more money in\norder to improve mental health screening and treatment, to deter gun violence\nin America.In the United States in 2009 there were 3.0 recorded intentional\nhomicides committed with a firearm per 100,000 inhabitants. The U.S. ranks 28\nin the world for gun homicides per capita.[169] A U.S. male aged 15–24 is 70\ntimes more likely to be killed with a gun than their counterpart in the eight\n(G-8) largest industrialized nations in the world (United Kingdom, France,\nGermany, Japan, Canada, Italy, Russia).[170] In 2015, there were 33,636 deaths\ndue to firearms, and some claim as many as 372 [mass\nshootings](/wiki/Mass_shootings \"Mass shootings\"), in the U.S, while guns were\nused to kill about 50 people in the U.K.[170] However, using the FBI\ndefinition of a \"mass shooting\" there were only 4 in the U.S. in 2015.[171]\nMore people are typically killed with guns in the U.S. in a day (about 85)\nthan in the U.K. in a year.[170]\n\nWithin the gun politics debate, gun control and gun rights advocates disagree\nover the role that guns play in [crime](/wiki/Crime \"Crime\"). Gun control\nadvocates concerned about high levels of [gun violence](/wiki/Gun_violence\n\"Gun violence\") in the United States look to restrictions on gun ownership as\na way to stem the violence and say that increased gun ownership leads to\nhigher levels of crime, [suicide](/wiki/Suicide \"Suicide\") and other negative\noutcomes.[172][173] Gun rights groups say that a well-armed civilian populace\nprevents crime and that making civilian ownership of firearms illegal would\nincrease the [crime rate](/wiki/Crime_rate \"Crime rate\") by making civilians\nvulnerable to criminal activity.[174][175] They say that more civilians defend\nthemselves with a gun every year than the law enforcement arrest for violent\ncrimes and burglary[176] and that civilians legally shoot almost as many\ncriminals as law enforcement officers do.[177]\n\nStudies using FBI data and Police Reports of the incidents, have found that\nthere are approximately 1,500 verified instances of firearms used in self-\ndefense annually in the United States.[178] Survey-based research derived from\ndata gathered by the National Crime Victimization Survey has generated\nestimates that, out of roughly 5.5 million violent crime victims in the U.S.\nannually approximately 1.1 percent, or 55,000 used a firearm in self-defense\n(175,000 for the 3-year period.) [179] When including property crimes, of the\n15.5 million victims of property crimes annually found in the survey (46.5\nmillion for 2013-2015), the NCV survey data yielded estimates that around 0.2\npercent of property crime victims, or 36,000 annually (109,000 for the 3-year\nperiod) used a firearm in self-defense from the loss of property.[179]\nResearchers working from the most recent NCVS data sets have found\napproximately 95,000 uses of a firearm in self-defense in the U.S. each year\n(284,000 for the years 2013-2015).[179] In addition, the United States has a\nhigher rate of firearm ownership than any other nation.

The numbers of lives saved or lost by gun ownership is debated by\ncriminologists. Research difficulties include the difficulty of accounting\naccurately for confrontations in which no shots are fired and jurisdictional\ndifferences in the definition of \"crime.\" Furthermore,\n\nSuch research is also subject to a more fundamental difficulty affecting all\nresearch in this field: the effectiveness of the [Criminal\nLaw](/wiki/Criminal_Law \"Criminal Law\") in preventing crime in general or in\nspecific cases is inherently and notoriously difficult to prove and measure,\nand thus issues in establishing a causal link between gun control or\nparticular gun control policies and violent crime must be understood to be an\naspect of a more general empirical difficulty, which pervades the fields of\n[Criminology](/wiki/Criminology \"Criminology\") and [Law](/wiki/Law \"Law\") at\nlarge. It is not simple, for example, to prove a causal connection between the\nlaws against murder and the prevailing murder rates, either. Consequently,\nthis general background must be appreciated when discussing the causal and\nempirical issues here.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Alexis_Navy_Yard_012_1dsLQLVk7nY.jpg/220px-\nAlexis_Navy_Yard_012_1dsLQLVk7nY.jpg)](/wiki/File:Alexis_Navy_Yard_012_1dsLQLVk7nY.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Alexis_Navy_Yard_012_1dsLQLVk7nY.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPhoto from a security camera from the [Washington Navy Yard\nshooting](/wiki/Washington_Navy_Yard_shooting \"Washington Navy Yard\nshooting\").\n\nA study published in _The American Journal of Economics and Sociology_ in 1997\nconcluded that the amount of gun related crime and deaths is affected more by\nthe state of the area in terms of unemployment, alcohol problems and drug\nproblems instead of the laws and regulations.[180] This study analysed\nstatistics gathered on the amount of gun crime in states with strict and\nlenient gun policies and determined that the amount of gun crime is related to\nhow run down economically an area is.\n\nA 2003 CDC study determined \"The Task Force found insufficient evidence to\ndetermine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of\nlaws reviewed on violent outcomes.\"[53] They go on to state \"a finding of\ninsufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as\nevidence of ineffectiveness but rather as an indicator that additional\nresearch is needed before an intervention can be evaluated for its\neffectiveness.\"\n\nIn 2009, the [Public Health Law\nResearch](/w/index.php?title=Public_Health_Law_Research&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Public Health Law Research \\(page does not exist\\)\") program,[181] an\nindependent organization, published several evidence briefs summarizing the\nresearch assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health,\nthat concern the effectiveness of various laws related to gun safety.

In addition, up to 48% of households within\nAmerica have guns.[188] According to the [UNODC](/wiki/UNODC \"UNODC\"), 60% of\nU.S. homicides in 2009 were perpetrated using a firearm.[189] U.S. homicide\nrates vary widely from state to state. In 2014, the lowest homicide rates were\nin New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Vermont (each 0.0 per 100,000 people), and\nthe highest were in Louisiana (11.7) and Mississippi (11.4).[190]\n\n[Gary Kleck](/wiki/Gary_Kleck \"Gary Kleck\"), a criminologist at [Florida State\nUniversity](/wiki/Florida_State_University \"Florida State University\"), and\nhis colleague [Marc Gertz](/wiki/Marc_Gertz \"Marc Gertz\"), published a study\nin 1995 estimating that approximately 2.5 million American adults used their\ngun in self-defense annually. The incidents that Kleck extrapolated based on\nhis questionnaire results generally did not involve the firing of the gun, and\nhe estimates that as many as 1.9 million of those instances involved a\nhandgun.[191]:164 These studies have been subject to criticism on a number of\nmethodological and logical grounds.[192]\n\nAnother study from the same period, the National Crime Victimization Survey\n(NCVS), estimated 65,000 DGUs ([Defensive gun use](/wiki/Defensive_gun_use\n\"Defensive gun use\")) annually. The NCVS survey differed from Kleck's study in\nthat it only interviewed those who reported a threatened, attempted, or\ncompleted victimization for one of six crimes: rape, robbery, assault,\nburglary, non-business larceny, and motor vehicle theft. A National Research\nCouncil report said that Kleck's estimates appeared to be exaggerated and that\nit was almost certain that \"some of what respondents designate[d] as their own\nself-defense would be construed as aggression by others\".[193]\n\nResearch based on the NCVS data set largely confirms Hemenway's earlier\nresults, showing approximately 55,000 uses of a firearm in self-defense from a\nviolent crime in the United States for the 3-year period of 2013-2015.[179]\n\nIn a review of his own research, Kleck determined that, of 41 studies half of\nthem found a connection between gun ownership and homicide but these were\nusually least rigorous studies. Only six studies controlled at least six\nstatistically significant confound variables, and none of them showed a\nsignificant positive effect. Eleven macro-level studies showed that crime\nrates increase gun levels (not vice versa). The reason that there is no\nopposite effect may be that most owners are noncriminals and that they may use\nguns to prevent violence.[194]\n\nCommenting on the external validity of Kleck's report, [David\nHemenway](/wiki/David_Hemenway \"David Hemenway\"), director of the [Harvard\nInjury Control Research\nCenter](/wiki/Harvard_T.H._Chan_School_of_Public_Health \"Harvard T.H. Chan\nSchool of Public Health\"), said: \"Given the number of victims allegedly being\nsaved with guns, it would seem natural to conclude that owning a gun\nsubstantially reduces your chances of being murdered. Yet a careful case-\ncontrol study of homicide in the home found that a gun in the home was\nassociated with an increased rather than a reduced risk of homicide. Virtually\nall of this risk involved homicide by a family member or intimate\nacquaintance.\"[195]:1443 Kleck however pointed out that most of the firearms\nused in the Kellermann study were not the same ones kept in the household by\nthe victim.[196] Similarly in 2007 when the Permit-To-Purchase law was\nrepealed in Missouri,2008 saw a 34% increase in the rate of firearm homicides\nin that year alone, and the figure continues to be higher than the figure\npre-2007.[197]\n\nOne study found that homicide rates as a whole, especially those as a result\nof firearms use, are not always significantly lower in many other developed\ncountries. Kleck wrote, \"...cross-national comparisons do not provide a sound\nbasis for assessing the impact of gun ownership levels on crime rates.\"[198]\nOne study published in the [International Journal of\nEpidemiology](/wiki/International_Journal_of_Epidemiology \"International\nJournal of Epidemiology\"), which found that for the year of 1998: \"During the\none-year study period (1998), 88,649 firearm deaths were reported. Overall\nfirearm mortality rates are five to six times higher in high-income (HI) and\nupper middle-income (UMI) countries in the Americas (12.72) than in Europe\n(2.17) or Oceania (2.57) and 95 times higher than in Asia (0.13). The rate of\nfirearm deaths in the United States (14.24 per 100,000) exceeds that of its\neconomic counterparts (1.76) eightfold and that of UMI countries (9.69) by a\nfactor of 1.5. Suicide and homicide contribute equally to total firearm deaths\nin the U.S., but most firearm deaths are suicides (71%) in HI countries and\nhomicides (72%) in UMI countries.\"[199]\n\n####\nSuicide[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_politics_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Suicide\")]\n\nFirearms accounted for 51.5% of U.S. suicides in 2013, and suicides account\nfor 63% of all firearm-related deaths.[200] According to Kleck, most research\nhas found no relationship between gun availability and suicide rates.[201] In\ncontrast, a 2012 review by researchers at the [Harvard School of Public\nHealth](/wiki/Harvard_School_of_Public_Health \"Harvard School of Public\nHealth\") found that in the United States, the percent of suicide attempts that\nprove fatal is \"strongly related to the availability of household\nfirearms.\"[202]\n\n## Federal and state\nlaws[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_politics_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: Federal and state laws\")]\n\nThe number of federal and state gun laws is unknown.

Each of the fifty states has its\nown laws regarding guns.\n\nForty four of the fifty US states have the right to keep and bear arms written\ninto their state constitutions.[207] The text of these constitutional\nprovisions vary. For example, Hawaii's constitution simply copies the text of\nthe Second Amendment verbatim,[208] while North Carolina and South Carolina\nbegin with the same but continue with an injunction against maintaining\nstanding armies.[209][210] Alaska also begins with the full text of the Second\nAmendment, but adds that the right \"shall not be denied or infringed by the\nState or a political subdivision of the State\".[211] Rhode Island subtracts\nthe first half of the Second Amendment, leaving only, \"[t]he right of the\npeople to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\".[212]\n\nThe majority of the remaining states' constitutions differ from the text of\nthe U.S. Constitution primarily in their clarification of exactly to whom the\nright belongs or by the inclusion of additional, specific protections or\nrestrictions. Seventeen states refer to the right to keep and bear arms as\nbeing an individual right, with Utah and Alaska referring to it explicitly as\n\"[t]he individual right to keep and bear arms\",[211][213] while the other\nfifteen refer to the right as belonging to \"every citizen\",[214] \"all\nindividuals\",[215] \"all persons\",[216] or another, very similar phrase.[nb 1]\nIn contrast are four states which make no mention whatever of an individual\nright or of defense of one's self as a valid basis for the right to arms.\nArkansas, Massachusetts, and Tennessee all state that the right is \"for the\ncommon defense\",[229][230][231] while Virginia's constitution explicitly\nindicates that the right is derived from the need for a militia to defend the\nstate.[232]\n\nMost state constitutions enumerate one or more reasons for the keeping of\narms. Twenty-four states include self-defense as a valid, protected use of\narms;[nb 2] twenty-eight cite defense of the state as a proper purpose.[nb 3]\nTen states extend the right to defense of home and/or property,[nb 4] five\ninclude the defense of family,[nb 5] and six add hunting and recreation.[nb 6]\nIdaho is uniquely specific in its provision that \"[n]o law shall impose\nlicensure, registration, or special taxation on the ownership or possession of\nfirearms or ammunition. Nor shall any law permit the confiscation of firearms,\nexcept those actually used in the commission of a felony\".[233] Fifteen state\nconstitutions include specific restrictions on the right to keep and bear\narms. Florida's constitution calls for a three-day waiting period for all\nmodern cartridge handgun purchases, with exceptions for handgun purchases by\nthose holding a [CCW](/wiki/Carrying_concealed_weapon \"Carrying concealed\nweapon\") license, or for anyone who purchases a black-powder handgun.[234]\nIllinois prefaces the right by indicating that it is \"[s]ubject...to the\npolice power\".[224] Florida and the remaining thirteen states with specific\nrestrictions all carry a provision to the effect that the state legislature\nmay enact laws regulating the carrying, concealing, and/or wearing of arms.[nb\n7] Forty states [preempt](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preemption\n\"wikt:preemption\") some or all local gun laws, due in part to campaigning by\nthe NRA for such
