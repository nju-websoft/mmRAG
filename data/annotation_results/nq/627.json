The men's 400 m has been present on the [Olympic athletics\nprogramme](/wiki/Athletics_at_the_Summer_Olympics \"Athletics at the Summer\nOlympics\") since [1896](/wiki/1896_Summer_Olympics \"1896 Summer Olympics\") but\nnearly seventy years passed before the introduction of the women's 400 m,\nwhich has been held continuously since the [1964\nGames](/wiki/1964_Summer_Olympics \"1964 Summer Olympics\"). It is the most\nprestigious 400 m race at elite level. The competition format typically has\ntwo qualifying rounds leading to a final race between eight athletes.\n\nThe [Olympic record](/wiki/List_of_Olympic_records_in_athletics \"List of\nOlympic records in athletics\") for the men's race was set in 2016, and the\nrecord for the women's race was set in 1996. [Wayde van\nNiekerk](/wiki/Wayde_van_Niekerk \"Wayde van Niekerk\") holds the men's record\nof 43.03 seconds, breaking world and Olympic records that had been held by\n[Michael Johnson](/wiki/Michael_Johnson_\\(sprinter\\) \"Michael Johnson\n\\(sprinter\\)\") since 1999 and 1996 respectively. [Marie-José\nPérec](/wiki/Marie-Jos%C3%A9_P%C3%A9rec \"Marie-José Pérec\") is the women's\nrecord holder at 48.25 seconds. The [men's world\nrecord](/wiki/Men%27s_400_metres_world_record_progression \"Men's 400 metres\nworld record progression\") has been broken several times at the Olympics: in\n1912, 1932, 1960, 1968, and 2016. [Irena Szewińska](/wiki/Irena_Szewi%C5%84ska\n\"Irena Szewińska\") is the only person to break the [women's world\nrecord](/wiki/Women%27s_400_metres_world_record_progression \"Women's 400\nmetres world record progression\") at the competition, doing so in 1976.\n\nOnly two athletes have won the event twice: [Marie-José Pérec](/wiki/Marie-\nJos%C3%A9_P%C3%A9rec \"Marie-José Pérec\") became the first to defend the title\nin 1996, then Michael Johnson followed with victories in 1996 and 2000. No\nathlete has won more than three medals. Several medalists in the event have\nalso had success in the [200 metres at the\nOlympics](/wiki/200_metres_at_the_Olympics \"200 metres at the Olympics\"):\nJohnson, Perec, Szewińska and [Valerie Brisco-Hooks](/wiki/Valerie_Brisco-\nHooks \"Valerie Brisco-Hooks\") have all won titles at both distances. Athletes\nchosen for the event almost always form part of their nation's team for the\n[4×400 metres relay at the\nOlympics](/wiki/4%C3%97400_metres_relay_at_the_Olympics \"4×400 metres relay at\nthe Olympics\").\n\nThe [United States](/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics \"United States at the\nOlympics\") is by far the most successful nation in the event, with 21 gold\nmedals and 44 medals in total. The next most successful nation is [Great\nBritain](/wiki/Great_Britain_at_the_Olympics \"Great Britain at the Olympics\")\nwith three gold among its 13 medals. The [1908 men's 400\nmetres](/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1908_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_400_metres\n\"Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men's 400 metres\") saw the
