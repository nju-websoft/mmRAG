He founded New France by planting a cross on the shore of\nthe [Gaspé Peninsula](/wiki/Gasp%C3%A9_Peninsula \"Gaspé Peninsula\"). The\nFrench subsequently tried to establish several colonies throughout North\nAmerica that failed, due to weather, disease, or conflict with other European\npowers. Cartier attempted to create the first permanent European settlement in\nNorth America at [Cap-Rouge](/wiki/Cap-Rouge,_Quebec_City \"Cap-Rouge, Quebec\nCity\") (Quebec City) in 1541 with 400 settlers but the settlement was\nabandoned the next year after bad weather and attacks from [Native\nAmericans](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas \"Indigenous peoples of the\nAmericas\") in the area. A small group of French troops were left on [Parris\nIsland, South Carolina](/wiki/Parris_Island,_South_Carolina \"Parris Island,\nSouth Carolina\") in 1562 to build [Charlesfort](/wiki/Charlesfort\n\"Charlesfort\"), but left after a year when they were not resupplied by France.\n[Fort Caroline](/wiki/Fort_Caroline \"Fort Caroline\") established in present-\nday [Jacksonville, Florida](/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida \"Jacksonville,\nFlorida\"), in 1564, lasted only a year before being destroyed by the Spanish\nfrom [St. Augustine](/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida \"St. Augustine, Florida\").\nAn attempt to settle convicts on [Sable Island](/wiki/Sable_Island \"Sable\nIsland\") off Nova Scotia in 1598 failed after a short time. In 1599, a\nsixteen-person trading post was established in\n[Tadoussac](/wiki/Tadoussac,_Quebec \"Tadoussac, Quebec\") (in present-day\n[Quebec](/wiki/Quebec \"Quebec\")), of which only five men survived the first\nwinter.

The following year the settlement was\nmoved to [Port Royal](/wiki/Habitation_at_Port-Royal \"Habitation at Port-\nRoyal\"), located in present-day [Nova Scotia](/wiki/Nova_Scotia \"Nova\nScotia\").\n\n[Samuel de Champlain](/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain \"Samuel de Champlain\") founded\n[Quebec](/wiki/Quebec_City \"Quebec City\") (1608) and explored the [Great\nLakes](/wiki/Great_Lakes \"Great Lakes\"). In 1634, [Jean\nNicolet](/wiki/Jean_Nicolet \"Jean Nicolet\") founded _La Baye des Puants_\n(present-day [Green Bay](/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin \"Green Bay, Wisconsin\")),\nwhich is one of the oldest permanent European settlements in America. In 1634,\n[Sieur de Laviolette](/wiki/Sieur_de_Laviolette \"Sieur de Laviolette\") founded\nTrois-Rivières. In 1642, [Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de\nMaisonneuve](/wiki/Paul_de_Chomedey,_Sieur_de_Maisonneuve \"Paul de Chomedey,\nSieur de Maisonneuve\"), founded [Fort Ville-Marie](/wiki/Fort_Ville-Marie\n\"Fort Ville-Marie\") which is now known as [Montreal](/wiki/Montreal\n\"Montreal\").

Due to the lack of women, intermarriages between French and\nIndians were frequent, giving rise to the [Métis\npeople](/wiki/M%C3%A9tis_people_\\(Canada\\) \"Métis people \\(Canada\\)\").\nRelations between the French and Indians were usually peaceful. As the 19th-\ncentury historian [Francis Parkman](/wiki/Francis_Parkman \"Francis Parkman\")\nstated:\n\n> \"Spanish civilization crushed the Indian; English civilization scorned and\n> neglected him; French civilization embraced and cherished him\"\n>\n> — Francis Parkman.[4]\n\nTo boost the French population, [Cardinal Richelieu](/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu\n\"Cardinal Richelieu\") issued an act declaring that Indians converted to\nCatholicism were considered as \"natural Frenchmen\" by the\n[Ordonnance](/wiki/Ordonnance \"Ordonnance\") of 1627:\n\n> \"The descendants of the French who are accustomed to this country [New\n> France], together with all the Indians who will be brought to the knowledge\n> of the faith and will profess it, shall be deemed and renowned natural\n> Frenchmen, and as such may come to live in France when they want, and\n> acquire, donate, and succeed and accept donations and legacies, just as true\n> French subjects, without being required to take no letters of declaration of\n> naturalization.\"[5]\n\n[Louis XIV](/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France \"Louis XIV of France\") also tried to\nincrease the population by sending approximately 800 young women nicknamed the\n\"[King's Daughters](/wiki/King%27s_Daughters \"King's Daughters\")\". However,\nthe low density of population in New France remained a very persistent\nproblem. At the beginning of the [French and Indian\nWar](/wiki/French_and_Indian_War \"French and Indian War\") (1754–1763), the\nBritish population in North America outnumbered the French 20 to 1. France\nfought a total of six colonial wars in North America (see the four [French and\nIndian Wars](/wiki/French_and_Indian_Wars \"French and Indian Wars\") as well as\n[Father Rale's War](/wiki/Father_Rale%27s_War \"Father Rale's War\") and [Father\nLe Loutre's War](/wiki/Father_Le_Loutre%27s_War \"Father Le Loutre's War\")).[6]\n\nSee also: [Franco-Indian alliance](/wiki/Franco-Indian_alliance \"Franco-Indian\nalliance\")\n\n### French\nFlorida[[edit](/w/index.php?title=French_colonization_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: French Florida\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Nouvelle-\nFrance_floridienne.png/220px-Nouvelle-\nFrance_floridienne.png)](/wiki/File:Nouvelle-France_floridienne.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nouvelle-France_floridienne.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nMap of French Florida\n\nIn 1562, [Charles IX](/wiki/Charles_IX_of_France \"Charles IX of France\"),\nunder the leadership of Admiral [Gaspard de\nColigny](/wiki/Gaspard_II_de_Coligny \"Gaspard II de Coligny\") sent [Jean\nRibault](/wiki/Jean_Ribault \"Jean Ribault\") and a group of\n[Huguenot](/wiki/Huguenot \"Huguenot\") settlers in an attempt to colonize the\nAtlantic coast and found a colony on a territory which will take the name of\nthe [French Florida](/wiki/French_Florida \"French Florida\").

The group, led by [René\nGoulaine de Laudonnière](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Goulaine_de_Laudonni%C3%A8re \"René\nGoulaine de Laudonnière\"), moved to the south where they founded the [Fort\nCaroline](/wiki/Fort_Caroline \"Fort Caroline\") on the Saint John's river in\n[Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\") on June 22, 1564.[7]\n\nThis irritated the Spanish who claimed Florida and opposed the\n[Protestant](/wiki/Protestant \"Protestant\") settlers for religious reasons. In\n1565, [Pedro Menéndez de Avilés](/wiki/Pedro_Men%C3%A9ndez_de_Avil%C3%A9s\n\"Pedro Menéndez de Avilés\") led a group of Spaniards and founded [Saint\nAugustine](/wiki/Saint_Augustine,_Florida \"Saint Augustine, Florida\"), 60\nkilometers south of Fort Caroline. Fearing a Spanish attack, Ribault planned\nto move the colony but a [storm](/wiki/Storm \"Storm\") suddenly destroyed his\nfleet.

However, at the\nbeginning of the 17th century, France was more interested in fur from North\nAmerica. The fur trading post of [Tadoussac](/wiki/Tadoussac \"Tadoussac\") was\nfounded in 1600. Four years later, [Champlain](/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain\n\"Samuel de Champlain\") made his first trip to Canada in a trade mission for\nfur. Although he had no formal mandate on this trip, he sketched a map of the\nSt. Lawrence River and in writing, on his return to France, a report entitled\n_Savages_[9] (Relation of his stay in a tribe of\n[Montagnais](/wiki/Innu_people \"Innu people\") near Tadoussac).\n\nChamplain needed to report his findings to [Henry IV](/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France\n\"Henry IV of France\"). He participated in another expedition to New France in\nthe spring of 1604, conducted by [Pierre Du Gua de\nMonts](/wiki/Pierre_Du_Gua_de_Monts \"Pierre Du Gua de Monts\"). It helped the\nfoundation of a settlement on [Saint Croix\nIsland](/wiki/Saint_Croix_Island,_Maine \"Saint Croix Island, Maine\"), the\nfirst French settlement in the New World, which would be given up the\nfollowing winter. The expedition then founded the colony of [Port-\nRoyal](/wiki/Habitation_at_Port-Royal \"Habitation at Port-Royal\").\n\nIn 1608, Champlain founded a fur post that would become the city of\n[Quebec](/wiki/Quebec_\\(city\\) \"Quebec \\(city\\)\"), which would become the\ncapital of New France. In Quebec, Champlain forged alliances between France\nand the [Huron](/wiki/Huron-Wendat_Nation \"Huron-Wendat Nation\") and\n[Ottawa](/wiki/Odawa \"Odawa\") against their traditional enemies, the\n[Iroquois](/wiki/Iroquois \"Iroquois\"). Champlain and other French travelers\nthen continued to explore North America, with [canoes](/wiki/Canoe \"Canoe\")\nmade from [Birch](/wiki/Birch \"Birch\") [bark](/wiki/Bark_\\(botany\\) \"Bark\n\\(botany\\)\"), to move quickly through the [Great\nLakes](/wiki/Great_Lakes_\\(North_America\\) \"Great Lakes \\(North America\\)\")\nand their tributaries. In 1634, the Normand explorer [Jean\nNicolet](/wiki/Jean_Nicolet \"Jean Nicolet\") pushed his exploration to the West\nup to Wisconsin.[10]\n\nFollowing the capitulation of Quebec by the [Kirke](/wiki/David_Kirke \"David\nKirke\") brothers, the British occupied the city of Quebec and Canada from 1629\nto 1632. Samuel de Champlain was taken prisoner and there followed the\nbankruptcy of the [Company of One Hundred\nAssociates](/wiki/Company_of_One_Hundred_Associates \"Company of One Hundred\nAssociates\"). Following the [Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-\nLaye](/wiki/Treaty_of_Saint-Germain-en-Laye_\\(1632\\) \"Treaty of Saint-Germain-\nen-Laye \\(1632\\)\"), France took possession of the colony in 1632. The city of\n[Trois-Rivières](/wiki/Trois-Rivi%C3%A8res \"Trois-Rivières\") was founded in\n1634. In 1642, the Angevin [Jérôme le Royer de la\nDauversière](/wiki/J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me_le_Royer_de_la_Dauversi%C3%A8re \"Jérôme le\nRoyer de la Dauversière\") founded [Ville-Marie](/wiki/Fort_Ville-Marie \"Fort\nVille-Marie\") (later [Montreal](/wiki/Montreal \"Montreal\")) which was at that\ntime, a fort as protection against Iroquois attacks (the first great Iroquois\nwar lasted from 1642 to 1667).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/A_new_map_of_the_north_parts_of_America_claimed_by_France_under_ye_names_of_Louisiana..._%282674873145%29.jpg/350px-\nA_new_map_of_the_north_parts_of_America_claimed_by_France_under_ye_names_of_Louisiana..._%282674873145%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:A_new_map_of_the_north_parts_of_America_claimed_by_France_under_ye_names_of_Louisiana..._\\(2674873145\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:A_new_map_of_the_north_parts_of_America_claimed_by_France_under_ye_names_of_Louisiana..._\\(2674873145\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nA new map of the north parts of America claimed by France in 1720, according\nto the London cartographer [Herman Moll](/wiki/Herman_Moll \"Herman Moll\").\n\nDespite this rapid expansion, the colony developed very slowly. The Iroquois\nwars and diseases were the leading causes of death in the French colony. In\n1663 when [Louis XIV](/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France \"Louis XIV of France\")\nprovided the _Royal Government_ , the population of New France was only 2500\nEuropean inhabitants. That year, to increase the population, Louis XIV sent\nbetween 800 and 900 '[King's Daughters](/wiki/King%27s_Daughters \"King's\nDaughters\")' to become the wives of French settlers. The population of New\nFrance reached subsequently 7000 in 1674 and 15000 in 1689.[11][12]\n\nFrom 1689 to 1713, the French settlers were faced with almost incessant war\nduring the [French and Indian Wars](/wiki/French_and_Indian_Wars \"French and\nIndian Wars\"). From 1689 to 1697, they fought the British in the [Nine Years'\nWar](/wiki/Nine_Years%27_War \"Nine Years' War\"). The war against the Iroquois\ncontinued even after the [Treaty of Rijswijk](/wiki/Treaty_of_Rijswijk \"Treaty\nof Rijswijk\") until 1701, when the two parties agreed on peace. Then, the war\nagainst the English took over in the [War of the Spanish\nSuccession](/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession \"War of the Spanish\nSuccession\"). In 1690 and 1711, Quebec City had successfully resisted the\nattacks of the English navy and then British army. Nevertheless, the British\ntook advantage of the second war. With the signing of the [Treaty of\nUtrecht](/wiki/Treaty_of_Utrecht \"Treaty of Utrecht\") in 1713, France ceded to\nBritain Acadia (with a population of 1700 people),\n[Newfoundland](/wiki/Newfoundland \"Newfoundland\") and [Hudson\nBay](/wiki/Hudson_Bay \"Hudson Bay\"). Under the Sovereign Council, the\npopulation of the colony grew faster. However, the population growth was far\ninferior to that of the British [Thirteen Colonies](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies\n\"Thirteen Colonies\") to the south. In the middle of the 18th century, New\nFrance accounted for 60,000 people while the British colonies had more than\none million people. This placed the colony at a great military disadvantage\nagainst the British. The war between the colonies resumed in 1744, lasting\nuntil 1748. A final and decisive war began in 1754. The\n[Canadiens](/wiki/Canadiens \"Canadiens\") and the French were helped by\nnumerous alliances with Native Americans, but they were usually outnumbered on\nthe battlefield.[13]\n\n###\nLouisiana[[edit](/w/index.php?title=French_colonization_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Louisiana\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/La_Nouvelle-\nFrance.jpg/300px-La_Nouvelle-France.jpg)](/wiki/File:La_Nouvelle-France.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:La_Nouvelle-France.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLouisiana before 1736\n\nOn May 17, 1673, explorers [Louis Jolliet](/wiki/Louis_Jolliet \"Louis\nJolliet\") and [Jacques Marquette](/wiki/Jacques_Marquette \"Jacques Marquette\")\nbegan exploring the Mississippi River, known to the Sioux as _does Tongo,_ or\nto the [Miami-Illinois](/wiki/Miami-Illinois_language \"Miami-Illinois\nlanguage\") as _missisipioui_ (_the great river_).

The newly\nmarried couples were chained together and taken to the port of embarkation. In\nMay 1720, after complaints from the Mississippi Company and the concessioners\nabout this class of French immigrants, the French government prohibited such\ndeportations. However, there was a third shipment of prisoners in 1721.[16]\n\n###\nDissolution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=French_colonization_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Dissolution\")]\n\nThe last [French and Indian War](/wiki/French_and_Indian_War \"French and\nIndian War\") resulted in the dissolution of [New France](/wiki/New_France \"New\nFrance\"), with [Canada](/wiki/Canada_\\(New_France\\) \"Canada \\(New France\\)\")\ngoing to [Great Britain](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great\nBritain\") and [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana_\\(New_France\\) \"Louisiana \\(New\nFrance\\)\") going to [Spain](/wiki/Spain \"Spain\").

Nicknamed the \"Pearl of the Antilles\", Saint-Domingue\nbecame the richest colony in the Caribbean due to slave plantation production\nof sugar cane. It had the highest slave mortality rate in the western\nhemisphere.[18] A 1791 slave revolt, the only ever successful slave revolt,\nbegan the [Haitian Revolution](/wiki/Haitian_Revolution \"Haitian Revolution\"),\nled to freedom for the colony's slaves in 1794 and, a decade later, complete\nindependence for the country, which renamed itself [Haiti](/wiki/Haiti\n\"Haiti\"). France briefly also ruled the eastern portion of the island, which\nis now the [Dominican Republic](/wiki/Dominican_Republic \"Dominican\nRepublic\").\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, France ruled much of the [Lesser\nAntilles](/wiki/Lesser_Antilles \"Lesser Antilles\") at various times. Islands\nthat came under French rule during part or all of this time include\n[Dominica](/wiki/Dominica \"Dominica\"), [Grenada](/wiki/Grenada \"Grenada\"),\n[Guadeloupe](/wiki/Guadeloupe \"Guadeloupe\"), [Marie-Galante](/wiki/Marie-\nGalante \"Marie-Galante\"), [Martinique](/wiki/Martinique \"Martinique\"), [St.\nBarthélemy](/wiki/Saint-Barth%C3%A9lemy \"Saint-Barthélemy\"), [St.\nCroix](/wiki/St._Croix \"St. Croix\"), [St. Kitts](/wiki/St._Kitts \"St. Kitts\"),\n[St. Lucia](/wiki/St._Lucia \"St. Lucia\"), [St. Martin](/wiki/Saint_Martin\n\"Saint Martin\"), [St. Vincent](/wiki/St._Vincent_\\(island\\) \"St. Vincent\n\\(island\\)\") and [Tobago](/wiki/Tobago \"Tobago\"). Control of many of these\nislands was contested between the French, the British and the Dutch; in the\ncase of St. Martin, the island was divided in two, a situation that persists\nto this day. [Great Britain](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great\nBritain\") captured some of France's islands during the [Seven Years'\nWar](/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War \"Seven Years' War\")[19] and the [Napoleonic\nWars](/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars \"Napoleonic Wars\").

The colony\nquickly became a haven for the [Huguenots](/wiki/Huguenots \"Huguenots\"), and\nwas ultimately destroyed by the Portuguese in 1567. On November 1, 1555,\nFrench vice-admiral [Nicolas Durand de\nVillegaignon](/wiki/Nicolas_Durand_de_Villegaignon \"Nicolas Durand de\nVillegaignon\") (1510–1575), a Catholic knight of the [Order of\nMalta](/wiki/Order_of_Malta \"Order of Malta\"), who later would help the\nHuguenots to find a refuge against persecution, led a small fleet of two ships\nand 600 soldiers and colonists, and took possession of the small island of\n[Serigipe](/wiki/Villegagnon_Island \"Villegagnon Island\") in the [Guanabara\nBay](/wiki/Guanabara_Bay \"Guanabara Bay\"), in front of present-day Rio de\nJaneiro, where they built a fort named Fort Coligny. The fort was named in\nhonor of [Gaspard de Coligny](/wiki/Gaspard_II_de_Coligny \"Gaspard II de\nColigny\") (then a Catholic statesman, who about a year later would become a\nHuguenot), an admiral who supported the expedition and would use the colony in\norder to protect his co-religionists. To the still largely undeveloped\nmainland village, Villegaignon gave the name of Henriville, in honour of\n[Henry II](/wiki/Henry_II_of_France \"Henry II of France\"), the [King of\nFrance](/wiki/King_of_France \"King of France\"), who also knew of and approved\nthe expedition, and had provided the fleet for the trip. Villegaignon secured\nhis position by making an alliance with the [Tamoio](/wiki/Tamoio \"Tamoio\")\nand [Tupinambá](/wiki/Tupinamb%C3%A1_people \"Tupinambá people\") Indians of the\nregion, who were fighting the Portuguese.\n\n#### 1557 Calvinist\narrival[[edit](/w/index.php?title=French_colonization_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: 1557 Calvinist arrival\")]\n\nUnchallenged by the Portuguese, who initially took little notice of his\nlanding, Villegaignon endeavoured to expand the colony by calling for more\ncolonists in 1556. He sent one of his ships, the Grande Roberge, to Honfleur,\nentrusted with letters to King Henry II, Gaspard de Coligny and according to\nsome accounts, the Protestant leader John Calvin. After one ship was sent to\nFrance to ask for additional support, three ships were financed and prepared\nby the king of France and put under the command of Sieur De Bois le Comte, a\nnephew of Villegagnon. They were joined by 14 Calvinists from Geneva, led by\nPhilippe de Corguilleray, including theologians Pierre Richier and Guillaume\nChartrier. The new colonists, numbering around 300, included 5 young women to\nbe wed, 10 boys to be trained as translators, as well as 14 Calvinists sent by\nCalvin, and also Jean de Léry, who would later write an account of the colony.\nThey arrived in March 1557. The relief fleet was composed of: The Petite\nRoberge, with 80 soldiers and sailors was led by Vice Admiral Sieur De Bois le\nComte. The Grande Roberge, with about 120 on board, captained by Sieur de\nSainte-Marie dit l'Espine. The Rosée, with about 90 people, led by Captain\nRosée. Doctrinal disputes arose between Villegagnon and the Calvinists,\nespecially in relation to the Eucharist, and in October 1557 the Calvinists\nwere banished from Coligny island as a result. They settled among the\nTupinamba until January 1558, when some of them managed to return to France by\nship together with Jean de Léry, and five others chose to return to Coligny\nisland where three of them were drowned by Villegagnon for refusing to recant.\n\n#### Portuguese\nintervention[[edit](/w/index.php?title=French_colonization_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Portuguese intervention\")]\n\nIn 1560 Mem de Sá, the new Governor-General of Brazil, received from the\nPortuguese government the command to expel the French. With a fleet of 26\nwarships and 2,000 soldiers, on 15 March 1560, he attacked and destroyed Fort\nColigny within three days, but was unable to drive off their inhabitants and\ndefenders, because they escaped to the mainland with the help of the Native\nBrazilians, where they continued to live and to work. Admiral Villegaignon had\nreturned to France in 1558, disgusted with the religious tension that existed\nbetween French Protestants and Catholics, who had come also with the second\ngroup (see French Wars of Religion). Urged by two influential Jesuit priests\nwho had come to Brazil with Mem de Sá, named José de Anchieta and Manuel da\nNóbrega, and who had played a big role in pacifying the Tamoios, Mem de Sá\nordered his nephew, Estácio de Sá to assemble a new attack force. Estácio de\nSá founded the city of Rio de Janeiro on March 1, 1565, and fought the\nFrenchmen for two more years. Helped by a military reinforcement sent by his\nuncle, on January 20, 1567, he imposed final defeat on the French forces and\ndecisively expelled them from Brazil, but died a month later from wounds\ninflicted in the battle. Coligny's and Villegaignon's dream had lasted a mere\n12 years.\n\n### Equinoctial\nFrance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=French_colonization_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Equinoctial France\")]\n\nEquinoctial France was the contemporary name given to the colonization efforts\nof France in the 17th century in South America, around the line of Equator,\nbefore \"tropical\" had fully gained its modern meaning: Equinoctial means in\nLatin \"of equal nights\", i.e., on the Equator, where the duration of days and\nnights is nearly the same year round. The French colonial empire in the New\nWorld also included New France (Nouvelle France) in North America,\nparticularly in what is today the province of Quebec, Canada, and for a very\nshort period (12 years) also Antarctic France (France Antarctique, in French),\nin present-day Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All of these settlements were in\nviolation of the papal bull of 1493, which divided the New World between Spain\nand Portugal. This division was later defined more exactly by the Treaty of\nTordesillas.\n\n### History of France\nÉquinoxiale[[edit](/w/index.php?title=French_colonization_of_the_Americas&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: History of France Équinoxiale\")]\n\nFrance Équinoxiale started in 1612, when a French expedition departed from\nCancale, Brittany, France, under the command of Daniel de la Touche, Seigneur\nde la Ravardière, and François de Razilly, admiral. Carrying 500 colonists, it\narrived in the Northern coast of what is today the Brazilian state of\nMaranhão. De la Ravardière had discovered the region in 1604 but the death of\nthe king postponed his plans to start its colonization. The colonists soon\nfounded a village, which was named \"Saint-Louis\", in honor of the French king\nLouis IX. This later became São Luís in Portuguese,[1] the only Brazilian\nstate capital founded by France. On 8 September, Capuchin friars prayed the\nfirst mass, and the soldiers started building a fortress. An important\ndifference in relation to France Antarctique is that this new colony was not\nmotivated by escape from religious persecutions to Protestants (see French\nWars of Religion). The colony did not last long. A Portuguese army assembled\nin the Captaincy of Pernambuco, under the command of Alexandre de Moura, was\nable to mount a military expedition, which defeated and expelled the French\ncolonists in 1615, less than four years after their arrival in the land. Thus,\nit repeated the disaster spelt for the colonists of France Antarctique, in\n1567. A few years later, in 1620, Portuguese and Brazilian colonists arrived\nin number and São Luís started to develop, with an economy based mostly in\nsugar cane and slavery.\n\nFrench traders and colonists tried again to settle a France Équinoxiale\nfurther North, in what is today French Guiana, in 1626, 1635 (when the\ncapital, Cayenne, was founded) and 1643. Twice a Compagnie de la France\nÉquinoxiale was founded, in 1643 and 1645, but both foundered as a result of\nmisfortune and mismanagement. It was only after 1674, when the colony came\nunder the direct control of the French crown and a competent Governor took\noffice, that France Équinoxiale became a reality. To this day, French Guiana\nis a department of France.[20]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/French_Guiana_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/150px-\nFrench_Guiana_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png)](/wiki/File:French_Guiana_\\(orthographic_projection\\).svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:French_Guiana_\\(orthographic_projection\\).svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[French Guiana](/wiki/French_Guiana \"French Guiana\") located in the South\nAmerican continent.\n\n[French Guiana](/wiki/French_Guiana \"French Guiana\") was first settled by the\nFrench in 1604, although its earliest settlements were abandoned in the face\nof hostilities from the [indigenous\npopulation](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas \"Indigenous peoples of\nthe Americas\") and tropical diseases. The settlement of\n[Cayenne](/wiki/Cayenne \"Cayenne\") was established in 1643, but was abandoned.\nIt was re-established in the 1660s. Except for brief occupations by the\nEnglish and Dutch in the 17th century, and by the Portuguese in the 19th\ncentury, Guiana has remained under French rule ever since. From 1851 to 1951\nit was the site of a notorious [penal colony](/wiki/Penal_colony \"Penal\ncolony\"), [Devil's Island](/wiki/Devil%27s_Island \"Devil's Island\") (_Île du\nDiable_).
