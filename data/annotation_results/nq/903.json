However, it is most likely that the real\ntemperature on the site was lower than that recorded at Vostok.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Historical progression\n  * 2 Laboratory cooling\n    * 2.1 Early\n    * 2.2 Modern\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Historical\nprogression[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Historical progression\")]\n\nOn January 21, 1838 a recording was made by the Russian merchant Neverov in\n[Yakutsk](/wiki/Yakutsk \"Yakutsk\"), of −60 °C (−76 °F; 213 K).[5] On January\n15, 1885 H. Wild reported that a temperature of −68 °C (−90 °F; 205 K) was\nnoted in [Verkhoyansk](/wiki/Verkhoyansk \"Verkhoyansk\").[5] A later\nmeasurement at the same place in February 1892 was reported as −69.8 °C (−93.6\n°F; 203.3 K). Soviet researchers later announced a recording of −67.7 °C\n(−89.9 °F; 205.5 K) in February 1933 at [Oymyakon](/wiki/Oymyakon \"Oymyakon\"),\nabout 650 km (400 mi) to the south-east of Verkhoyansk; this measurement was\nreported by Soviet texts through the 1940s as a record low, with the previous\nmeasurement from Verkhoyansk retroactively adjusted to −67.6 °C (−89.7 °F;\n205.6 K).[6]\n\nThe next reliable measurement was made during the 1957 season at the\n[Amundsen–Scott South Pole\nStation](/wiki/Amundsen%E2%80%93Scott_South_Pole_Station \"Amundsen–Scott South\nPole Station\") in [Antarctica](/wiki/Antarctica \"Antarctica\"), yielding −73.6\n°C (−100.5 °F; 199.6 K) on May 11 and −74.5 °C (−102.1 °F; 198.7 K) on\nSeptember 17.[5] A subsequent measurement of −88.3 °C (−126.9 °F; 184.8 K), on\nAugust 24, 1960, held the record until a temperature of −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F;\n184.0 K) was measured at the Soviet [Vostok Station](/wiki/Vostok_Station\n\"Vostok Station\"), on the [Antarctic Plateau](/wiki/Antarctic_Plateau\n\"Antarctic Plateau\"), on July 21, 1983.[7] This remains the record for a\ndirectly recorded temperature.\n\n## Laboratory\ncooling[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Laboratory cooling\")]\n\nFor more details on this topic, see [Absolute zero §\nHistory](/wiki/Absolute_zero#History \"Absolute zero\").\n\n###\nEarly[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Early\")]\n\nIn 1904 Dutch scientist [Heike Kamerlingh Onnes](/wiki/Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes\n\"Heike Kamerlingh Onnes\") created a special lab in [Leiden](/wiki/Leiden\n\"Leiden\") with the aim of producing [liquid helium](/wiki/Liquid_helium\n\"Liquid helium\"). In 1908 he managed to lower the temperature to less than\n−269 °C (-452.2 F, 4 K), which is less than four degrees above [absolute\nzero](/wiki/Absolute_zero \"Absolute zero\"). Only in this exceptionally cold\nstate will helium liquefy, the boiling point of helium being at −268.94 °C\n(-452.092 F). Kamerlingh Onnes received a [Nobel Prize](/wiki/Nobel_Prize\n\"Nobel Prize\") for his achievement.[8]\n\nOnnes' method relied upon depressurising the subject gases, causing them to\ncool by [adiabatic cooling](/wiki/Adiabatic_cooling \"Adiabatic\ncooling\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] This follows from the first law of\nthermodynamics;\n\nΔ U = Δ Q − Δ W {\\displaystyle \\Delta U=\\Delta Q-\\Delta W} ![\\\\Delta U=\\\\Delta\nQ-\\\\Delta\nW](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eb42dc99e2fb6fd5c896a5ccd8e3e5af6f548683)\n\nwhere _U_ = [internal energy](/wiki/Internal_energy \"Internal energy\"), _Q_ =\n[heat](/wiki/Heat \"Heat\") added to the system, _W_ =\n[work](/wiki/Work_\\(thermodynamics\\) \"Work \\(thermodynamics\\)\") done by the\nsystem.\n\nConsider a gas in a box of set volume.

However, this was the\ntemperature of one particular type of motion—a quantum property called nuclear\nspin—not the overall average thermodynamic temperature for all possible\ndegrees of freedom.[9] At such low temperatures, the concept of\n\"[temperature](/wiki/Temperature \"Temperature\")\" becomes multifaceted since\nmolecular motion cannot be assumed to average out across degrees of\nfreedom.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The corresponding peak emission will be in\nradio waves, rather than in the familiar infrared, so it is very inefficiently\nabsorbed by neighboring atoms, making it difficult to reach thermal\nequilibrium.\n\nLow Temperature Laboratory recorded a record low temperature of 100\n[pK](/wiki/1_E-12_K \"1 E-12 K\"), or 1.0 × 10−10 K in 1999.[10]\n\nThe current apparatus for achieving low temperatures has two stages. The first\nutilizes a [helium dilution refrigerator](/wiki/Dilution_refrigerator\n\"Dilution refrigerator\") to get to temperatures of millikelvins, then the next\nstage uses [adiabatic nuclear demagnetisation](/wiki/Adiabatic_demagnetization\n\"Adiabatic demagnetization\") to reach picokelvins.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nExtremely low temperatures are useful for observation of [quantum\nmechanical](/wiki/Quantum_mechanic \"Quantum mechanic\") phases of matter such\nas [superfluids](/wiki/Superfluid \"Superfluid\") and [Bose-Einstein\ncondensates](/wiki/Bose-Einstein_condensate \"Bose-Einstein condensate\"), which\nwould be disrupted by thermal motion.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Absolute zero](/wiki/Absolute_zero \"Absolute zero\")\n  * [Dilution refrigerator](/wiki/Dilution_refrigerator \"Dilution refrigerator\")\n  * [Highest temperature recorded on Earth](/wiki/Highest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth \"Highest temperature recorded on Earth\")\n  * [List of weather records](/wiki/List_of_weather_records \"List of weather records\")\n  * [Magnetic refrigeration](/wiki/Magnetic_refrigeration \"Magnetic refrigeration\")\n  * [Orders of magnitude (temperature)](/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_\\(temperature\\) \"Orders of magnitude \\(temperature\\)\")\n  * [Timeline of low-temperature technology](/wiki/Timeline_of_low-temperature_technology \"Timeline of low-temperature technology\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Turner, J.; Anderson, P.; Lachlan-Cope, T.; Colwell, S.; Phillips, T.; Kirchgaessner, A.
