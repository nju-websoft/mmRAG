All three also\nserve as head writers. The show premiered on [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") on\nSeptember 24, 2007.[3] The series' tenth season premiered on September 19,\n2016.[4] In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons,\nbringing its total to twelve, and running through the 2018–19 television\nseason. The eleventh season premiered on September 25, 2017.[5]\n\nThe show is primarily centered on five characters living in [Pasadena,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Pasadena,_California \"Pasadena, California\"): [Leonard\nHofstadter](/wiki/Leonard_Hofstadter \"Leonard Hofstadter\") and [Sheldon\nCooper](/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper \"Sheldon Cooper\"), both\n[physicists](/wiki/Physicist \"Physicist\") at [Caltech](/wiki/Caltech\n\"Caltech\"), who share an apartment;\n[Penny](/wiki/Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\) \"Penny \\(The Big Bang Theory\\)\"),\na waitress and aspiring actress who later becomes a pharmaceutical\nrepresentative and who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's\nsimilarly [geeky](/wiki/Geeky \"Geeky\") and socially awkward friends and co-\nworkers, [aerospace engineer](/wiki/Aerospace_engineer \"Aerospace engineer\")\n[Howard Wolowitz](/wiki/Howard_Wolowitz \"Howard Wolowitz\") and\n[astrophysicist](/wiki/Astrophysicist \"Astrophysicist\") [Raj\nKoothrappali](/wiki/Raj_Koothrappali \"Raj Koothrappali\"). The geekiness and\nintellect of the four men are contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social\nskills and common sense.[6][7]\n\nOver time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: [Leslie\nWinkle](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Leslie_Winkle \"List of\nThe Big Bang Theory characters\"), a physicist who dated Leonard and Howard;\n[neuroscientist](/wiki/Neuroscientist \"Neuroscientist\") [Amy Farrah\nFowler](/wiki/Amy_Farrah_Fowler \"Amy Farrah Fowler\"), who joins the group\nafter being matched to Sheldon on a dating website (and later becomes\nSheldon's girlfriend); [Bernadette Rostenkowski](/wiki/Bernadette_Rostenkowski\n\"Bernadette Rostenkowski\"), Howard's wife (previously his girlfriend), a\n[microbiologist](/wiki/Microbiologist \"Microbiologist\") and former part-time\nwaitress alongside Penny; [Stuart Bloom](/wiki/Stuart_Bloom \"Stuart Bloom\"),\nthe cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit;\nand [Emily Sweeney](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Emily \"List\nof The Big Bang Theory characters\"), a [dermatologist](/wiki/Dermatologist\n\"Dermatologist\") who dated Raj.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Production\n    * 1.1 Theme song\n    * 1.2 Actors' salaries\n  * 2 Cast and characters\n    * 2.1 Scientist cameos\n  * 3 Episodes\n  * 4 Recurring themes and elements\n    * 4.1 Science\n    * 4.2 Science fiction media\n    * 4.3 Leonard and Penny's relationship\n    * 4.4 Sheldon and Amy's relationship\n    * 4.5 Howard's mother\n    * 4.6 Vanity cards\n    * 4.7 _The Theorists_\n  * 5 Reception\n    * 5.1 Critical reception\n    * 5.2 U.S. standard ratings\n    * 5.3 UK distribution and ratings\n    * 5.4 Canadian ratings\n  * 6 Broadcast\n    * 6.1 Syndication\n    * 6.2 Online media\n  * 7 Home media\n  * 8 Awards and nominations\n  * 9 Merchandise\n  * 10 Spin-off series\n  * 11 Notes\n  * 12 References\n  * 13 External links\n\n## Production\n\nThe structure of the original, unaired pilot, developed for the 2006–07\ntelevision season, was substantially different from the series' current form.\nThe only characters retained in both pilots were Leonard ([Johnny\nGalecki](/wiki/Johnny_Galecki \"Johnny Galecki\")) and Sheldon ([Jim\nParsons](/wiki/Jim_Parsons \"Jim Parsons\")), who are named after [Sheldon\nLeonard](/wiki/Sheldon_Leonard \"Sheldon Leonard\"), a longtime figure in\nepisodic television as producer, director and actor. Althea ([Vernee\nWatson](/wiki/Vernee_Watson \"Vernee Watson\")) was a character featured in both\npilots and the first series episode.[8] Two female leads were Canadian actress\n[Amanda Walsh](/wiki/Amanda_Walsh \"Amanda Walsh\") as Katie, \"a street-\nhardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior,\"[9][10] and [Iris\nBahr](/wiki/Iris_Bahr \"Iris Bahr\") as Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend\nof the male characters. Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up\nwith a boyfriend and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is\nthreatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie,\nbut they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used [Thomas\nDolby](/wiki/Thomas_Dolby \"Thomas Dolby\")'s hit \"[She Blinded Me with\nScience](/wiki/She_Blinded_Me_with_Science \"She Blinded Me with Science\")\" as\nits theme song.\n\nAlthough the show was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to\nretool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and\nretooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny ([Kaley\nCuoco](/wiki/Kaley_Cuoco \"Kaley Cuoco\")). The original unaired pilot never has\nofficially been released, but it has circulated on the Internet.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] On the\nevolution of the show, [Chuck Lorre](/wiki/Chuck_Lorre \"Chuck Lorre\") said,\n\"We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ...\nbut there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was\nJohnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely and then we were blessed with\nKaley and Simon and Kunal.\" As to whether the world will ever see the original\npilot on a future DVD release, Lorre said, \"Wow, that would be something. We\nwill see. Show your failures...\"[11]\n\nThe first and second pilots of _The Big Bang Theory_ were directed by [James\nBurrows](/wiki/James_Burrows \"James Burrows\"), who did not continue with the\nshow. The reworked second pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14,\n2007.[12] Prior to its airing on [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\"), the pilot episode was\ndistributed on [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes_Store \"ITunes Store\") free of charge. The\nshow premiered on September 24, 2007, and was picked up for a full 22-episode\nseason on October 19, 2007.[13] The show is filmed in front of a live\naudience,[14] and is produced by [Warner Bros.\nTelevision](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television \"Warner Bros. Television\") and\n[Chuck Lorre Productions](/wiki/Chuck_Lorre_Productions \"Chuck Lorre\nProductions\").[15] Production was halted on November 6, 2007, due to the\n[Writers Guild of America\nstrike](/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike \"2007–08 Writers\nGuild of America strike\"). Nearly three months later, on February 4, 2008, the\nseries was temporarily replaced by a short-lived sitcom, _[Welcome to the\nCaptain](/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Captain \"Welcome to the Captain\")_. The series\nreturned on March 17, 2008, in an earlier time slot[16] and ultimately only 17\nepisodes were produced for the first season.[17][18]\n\nAfter the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season, airing in\nthe [2008–2009\nseason](/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_United_States_network_television_schedule\n\"2008–09 United States network television schedule\"), premiering in the same\ntime slot on September 22, 2008.[19] With increasing ratings, the show\nreceived a two-year renewal through the 2010–11 season in 2009.[20][21] In\n2011, the show was picked up for three more seasons.[22] In March 2014, the\nshow was renewed again for three more years through the 2016–17 season. This\nmarks the second time the series has gained a three-year renewal.[23] In March\n2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to\n12, and running through the 2018–19 television season.[24]\n\n[David Saltzberg](/wiki/David_Saltzberg \"David Saltzberg\"), a professor of\n[physics](/wiki/Physics \"Physics\") and [astronomy](/wiki/Astronomy\n\"Astronomy\") at the [University of California, Los\nAngeles](/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles \"University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles\"), checks scripts and provides dialogue, mathematics\nequations, and diagrams used as props.[6] According to executive producer/co-\ncreator [Bill Prady](/wiki/Bill_Prady \"Bill Prady\"), \"We're working on giving\nSheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the\n[first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... . We worked hard\nto get all the science right.\"[7]\n\nSeveral of the actors in _The Big Bang Theory_ previously worked together on\nthe sitcom _[Roseanne](/wiki/Roseanne \"Roseanne\")_ , including Johnny Galecki,\n[Sara Gilbert](/wiki/Sara_Gilbert \"Sara Gilbert\"), [Laurie\nMetcalf](/wiki/Laurie_Metcalf \"Laurie Metcalf\") (who plays Sheldon's mother,\n[Mary Cooper](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Mary_Cooper \"List\nof The Big Bang Theory characters\")), and [Meagen Fay](/wiki/Meagen_Fay\n\"Meagen Fay\") (who plays\n[Bernadette's](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Bernadette \"List\nof The Big Bang Theory characters\") mother). Additionally, Lorre was a writer\non the series for several seasons.\n\n### Theme song\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8d/Barenaked_Ladies_-\n_Big_Bang_Theory_Theme_%28Official_Single_Cover%29.png/200px-\nBarenaked_Ladies_-\n_Big_Bang_Theory_Theme_%28Official_Single_Cover%29.png)](/wiki/File:Barenaked_Ladies_-\n_Big_Bang_Theory_Theme_\\(Official_Single_Cover\\).png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Barenaked_Ladies_-\n_Big_Bang_Theory_Theme_\\(Official_Single_Cover\\).png \"Enlarge\")\n\nSingle cover for \"Big Bang Theory Theme\" by [Barenaked\nLadies](/wiki/Barenaked_Ladies \"Barenaked Ladies\") (2007)\n\nThe Canadian [alternative rock](/wiki/Alternative_rock \"Alternative rock\")\nband [Barenaked Ladies](/wiki/Barenaked_Ladies \"Barenaked Ladies\") wrote and\nrecorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of\nthe universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer [Ed Robertson](/wiki/Ed_Robertson\n\"Ed Robertson\") was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the\nshow after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles.\nBy coincidence, Robertson had recently read [Simon Singh](/wiki/Simon_Singh\n\"Simon Singh\")'s book _[Big Bang](/wiki/Big_Bang_\\(book\\) \"Big Bang\n\\(book\\)\")_ ,[25][26] and at the concert improvised a freestyle rap about the\norigins of the universe.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter\nand asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for\nother films and shows, but ending up being rejected because of producer's\nfavor of other artist's song, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after\nlearning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nOn October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the\nsong was released commercially.[27] Although some sources identify the song\ntitle as \"History of Everything,\"[28] the cover art for the single identifies\nthe title as \"Big Bang Theory Theme.\" A music video also was released via\nspecial features on _The Complete Fourth Season_ DVD and Blu-ray set.[29][30]\nThe theme was included on the band's greatest hits album, _[Hits from\nYesterday& the Day Before](/wiki/Hits_from_Yesterday_%26_the_Day_Before \"Hits\nfrom Yesterday & the Day Before\")_, released on September 27, 2011.[31] In\nSeptember 2015, [TMZ](/wiki/TMZ \"TMZ\") uncovered court documents showing that\n[Steven Page](/wiki/Steven_Page \"Steven Page\") sued former bandmate Robertson\nover the song, alleging that he was promised 20% of the proceeds, but that\nRobertson has kept that money entirely for himself.[32]\n\n### Actors' salaries\n\nFor the first three seasons, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco, the three main stars\nof the show, received at most $60,000 per episode. The salary for the three\nwent up to $200,000 per episode for the fourth season. Their per-episode pay\nwent up an additional $50,000 in each of the following three seasons,\nculminating in $350,000 per episode in the seventh season.[33][34] In\nSeptember 2013, Bialik and Rauch renegotiated the contracts they held since\nthey were introduced to the series in 2010. On their old contracts, each was\nmaking $20,000–$30,000 per episode, while the new contracts doubled that,\nbeginning at $60,000 per episode, increasing steadily to $100,000 per episode\nby the end of the contract, as well as adding another year for both.[35]\n\nBy season seven, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco were also receiving 0.25% of the\nseries' back-end money. Before production began on the eighth season, the\nthree plus Helberg and Nayyar, looked to renegotiate new contracts, with\nGalecki, Parsons, and Cuoco seeking around $1 million per episode, as well as\nmore back-end money.[36] Contracts were signed in the beginning of August\n2014, giving the three principal actors an estimated $1 million per episode\nfor three years, with the possibility to extend for a fourth year. The deals\nalso include larger pieces of the show, signing bonuses, production deals, and\nadvances towards the back-end.[37] Helberg and Nayyar were also able to\nrenegotiate their contracts, giving them a per-episode pay in the \"mid-six-\nfigure range\", up from around $100,000 per episode they each received in years\nprior. The duo, who were looking to have salary parity with Parsons, Galecki,\nand Cuoco, signed their contracts after the studio and producers threatened to\nwrite the characters out of the series if a deal could not be reached before\nthe start of production on season eight.[38] By season 10, Helberg and Nayyar\nreached the $1 million per episode parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco,\ndue to a clause in their deals signed in 2014.[39]\n\nIn March 2017, the main cast members (Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg, and\nNayyar) took a 10% pay cut to allow Bialik and Rauch an increase in their\nearnings.[40] This put Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg and Nayyar at $900,000\nper episode, with Parsons, Galecki, and Helberg also receiving overall deals\nwith Warner Bros. Television.[24] By the end of April, Bialik and Rauch had\nsigned deals to earn $500,000 per episode, each, with the deals also including\na separate development component for both actors. The deal was an increase\nfrom the $175,000 – $200,000 the duo had been making per episode.[41]\n\n## Cast and characters\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png) |  This section **describes a work or element of fiction in a primarily[in-universe](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Writing_about_fiction \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Writing about fiction\") style**.

Leonard is a nerd who loves video games, comic books, and _[Dungeons& Dragons](/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons \"Dungeons & Dragons\")_. Leonard is the [straight man](/wiki/Straight_man_\\(stock_character\\) \"Straight man \\(stock character\\)\") of the series, in which he shares an apartment in Pasadena, CA, with Sheldon. Leonard is smitten with his new neighbor Penny when they first meet, and they eventually marry.\n  * [Jim Parsons](/wiki/Jim_Parsons \"Jim Parsons\") as [Sheldon Cooper](/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper \"Sheldon Cooper\"):[43] Originally from [Galveston, Texas](/wiki/Galveston,_Texas \"Galveston, Texas\"), Sheldon was a child prodigy with an [eidetic memory](/wiki/Eidetic_memory \"Eidetic memory\") who began college at the age of eleven, and earned a PhD at age sixteen. He is a [theoretical physicist](/wiki/Theoretical_physics \"Theoretical physics\") researching [quantum mechanics](/wiki/Quantum_mechanics \"Quantum mechanics\") and [string theory](/wiki/String_theory \"String theory\"), and despite his IQ of 187, he finds many routine aspects of social situations difficult to grasp. He is determined to have his own way, continually boasts of his intelligence, and he has an extremely ritualized way of living. Despite these quirks, he begins a relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler.\n  * [Kaley Cuoco](/wiki/Kaley_Cuoco \"Kaley Cuoco\") as [Penny](/wiki/Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\) \"Penny \\(The Big Bang Theory\\)\"):[44] An aspiring actress from [Omaha, Nebraska](/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska \"Omaha, Nebraska\").

He goes into space, training as an astronaut and serving as a payload specialist. Howard initially fancies himself a womanizer, but he later starts dating Bernadette, and they get engaged and married. Howard also has a tendency to waste money on toys and argues with Bernadette because of his oddly low income as an engineer and her high income as a pharmaceutical biochemist.\n  * [Kunal Nayyar](/wiki/Kunal_Nayyar \"Kunal Nayyar\") as [Rajesh Koothrappali](/wiki/Raj_Koothrappali \"Raj Koothrappali\"):[46] A particle [astrophysicist](/wiki/Astrophysics \"Astrophysics\") originally from New Delhi, India.

The four main\nmale characters are employed at\n[Caltech](/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology \"California Institute of\nTechnology\") and have science-related occupations, as do Bernadette and Amy.\nThe characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news (notably\naround the [start of the show](/wiki/Cold_open \"Cold open\")), and make\nscience-related jokes.\n\nScience has also interfered with the characters' romantic lives. Leslie breaks\nup with Leonard when he sides with Sheldon in his support for [string\ntheory](/wiki/String_theory \"String theory\") rather than [loop quantum\ngravity](/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity \"Loop quantum gravity\").[69] When Leonard\njoins Sheldon, Raj, and Howard on a three-month Arctic research trip, it\nseparates Leonard and Penny at a time their relationship is budding. When\nBernadette takes an interest in Leonard's work, it makes both Penny and Howard\nenvious and results in Howard confronting Leonard, and Penny asking Sheldon to\nteach her physics.[70] Sheldon and Amy also briefly end their relationship\nafter an argument over which of their fields is superior.[71]\n\n[David Saltzberg](/wiki/David_Saltzberg \"David Saltzberg\"), who has a PhD in\nphysics, has served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and\nattends every taping.[72] While Saltzberg knows physics, he sometimes needs\nassistance from Mayim Bialik, who has a PhD in neuroscience.[73] Saltzberg\nsees early versions of scripts which need scientific information added to\nthem, and he also points out where the writers, despite their knowledge of\nscience, have made a mistake. He is usually not needed during a taping unless\na lot of science, and especially the whiteboard, is involved.[73]\n\n### Science fiction media\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/6.29.13WilWheatonByLuigiNovi1.jpg/170px-6.29.13WilWheatonByLuigiNovi1.jpg)](/wiki/File:6.29.13WilWheatonByLuigiNovi1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:6.29.13WilWheatonByLuigiNovi1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[Star Trek: The Next Generation](/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation \"Star\nTrek: The Next Generation\")_ actor [Wil Wheaton](/wiki/Wil_Wheaton \"Wil\nWheaton\") has a recurring role as a fictional version of himself on the show.\n\nThe four main male characters are all avid [science\nfiction](/wiki/Science_fiction \"Science fiction\"), [fantasy](/wiki/Fantasy\n\"Fantasy\"), and comic book fans and memorabilia collectors.\n\n_[Star Trek](/wiki/Star_Trek \"Star Trek\")_ in particular is frequently\nreferenced and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of\n[Spock](/wiki/Spock \"Spock\"), so much so that when he is given a used napkin\nsigned by [Leonard Nimoy](/wiki/Leonard_Nimoy \"Leonard Nimoy\") as a Christmas\ngift from Penny he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude (\"I possess\nthe DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!\").[74] _[Star Trek: The Original\nSeries](/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series \"Star Trek: The Original\nSeries\")_ cast member [George Takei](/wiki/George_Takei \"George Takei\") has\nmade a cameo, and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage\nMr. Spock action figure (both cameos were in dream sequences). _[Star Trek:\nThe Next Generation](/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation \"Star Trek: The Next\nGeneration\")_ cast members [Brent Spiner](/wiki/Brent_Spiner \"Brent Spiner\")\nand [LeVar Burton](/wiki/LeVar_Burton \"LeVar Burton\") have had cameos as\nthemselves,[75][76] while [Wil Wheaton](/wiki/Wil_Wheaton \"Wil Wheaton\") has a\nrecurring role as a [fictionalized version of\nhimself](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Wil_Wheaton \"List of The\nBig Bang Theory characters\").\n\nThey are also fans of _[Star Wars](/wiki/Star_Wars \"Star Wars\")_ ,\n_[Battlestar Galactica](/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica \"Battlestar Galactica\")_ ,\nand _[Doctor Who](/wiki/Doctor_Who \"Doctor Who\")_. In the episode \"The\nOrnithophobia Diffusion\", when there is a delay in watching _Star Wars_ on\nBlu-ray, Howard complains, \"If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to\nchange it again\" (referring to Lucas' controversial alterations to the films)\nand in \"The Hot Troll Deviation\", [Katee Sackhoff](/wiki/Katee_Sackhoff \"Katee\nSackhoff\") of _Battlestar Galactica_ appeared as Howard's fantasy dream girl.\nThe characters have different tastes in franchises with Sheldon praising\n_[Firefly](/wiki/Firefly_\\(TV_series\\) \"Firefly \\(TV series\\)\")_ but\ndisapproving of Leonard's enjoyment of _[Babylon 5](/wiki/Babylon_5 \"Babylon\n5\")_.[77][n 1] With regard to fantasy, the four make frequent references to\n_[The Lord of the Rings](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings \"The Lord of the Rings\")_\nand _[Harry Potter](/wiki/Harry_Potter \"Harry Potter\")_ novels and movies.\nAdditionally, Howard can speak [Sindarin](/wiki/Sindarin \"Sindarin\"), one of\nthe two [Elvish](/wiki/Elvish_languages \"Elvish languages\") languages from\n_The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nWednesday night is the group's designated \"comic book night\"[78] because that\nis the day of the week when new comic books are released. The comic book store\nis run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart. On a number of\noccasions, the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters,\nincluding [The Flash](/wiki/Flash_\\(comics\\) \"Flash \\(comics\\)\"),\n[Aquaman](/wiki/Aquaman \"Aquaman\"), [Frodo Baggins](/wiki/Frodo_Baggins \"Frodo\nBaggins\"), [Superman](/wiki/Superman \"Superman\"), [Batman](/wiki/Batman\n\"Batman\"), [Spock](/wiki/Spock \"Spock\"), [The Doctor](/wiki/Fourth_Doctor\n\"Fourth Doctor\"), [Green Lantern](/wiki/Green_Lantern \"Green Lantern\"), and\n[Thor](/wiki/Thor_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Thor \\(Marvel Comics\\)\").[79] As a\nconsequence of losing a bet to Stuart and Wil Wheaton, the group members are\nforced to visit the comic book store dressed as [Catwoman](/wiki/Catwoman\n\"Catwoman\"), [Wonder Woman](/wiki/Wonder_Woman \"Wonder Woman\"),\n[Batgirl](/wiki/Batgirl \"Batgirl\"), and [Supergirl](/wiki/Supergirl\n\"Supergirl\").[80] [DC Comics](/wiki/DC_Comics \"DC Comics\") announced that, to\npromote its comics, the company will sponsor Sheldon wearing Green Lantern\nT-shirts.[81]\n\nVarious games have been featured, as well as referenced, on the series (e.g.\n_[World of Warcraft](/wiki/World_of_Warcraft \"World of Warcraft\")_ ,\n_[Halo](/wiki/Halo_\\(series\\) \"Halo \\(series\\)\")_ ,\n_[Mario](/wiki/Mario_\\(franchise\\) \"Mario \\(franchise\\)\")_ , etc.), including\nfictional games like _Mystic Warlords of Ka 'a_ (which became a reality in\n2011)[82] and [Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock](/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-\nlizard-Spock \"Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock\").\n\n### Leonard and Penny's relationship\n\nOne of the recurring plot lines is the relationship between Leonard and Penny.\nLeonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do\nfavors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Meanwhile,\nPenny dates a series of muscular, attractive, unintelligent, and insensitive\njocks. Their first long term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a\nthree-month expedition to the [North Pole](/wiki/North_Pole \"North Pole\") in\nthe season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her,\nshe realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date\nother people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of\nseason 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely\nbelieve that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps\nwith a former boyfriend in \"[The Good Guy\nFluctuation](/wiki/The_Good_Guy_Fluctuation \"The Good Guy Fluctuation\")\".\n\nPenny, who admits to missing Leonard in \"The Roommate Transmogrification\",\naccepts his request to renew their relationship in \"The Beta Test Initiation\".\nAfter Penny suggests having sex in \"The Launch Acceleration\", Leonard breaks\nthe mood by proposing to her. Penny says \"no\" but does not break up with him.\nShe stops a proposal a second time in \"The Tangible Affection Proof\". In the\nsixth-season episode, \"The 43 Peculiarity\", Penny finally tells Leonard that\nshe loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives\nsignificant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their\nrelationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without\nworrying in \"The Bon Voyage Reaction\". After Leonard returns, their\nrelationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode \"The\nGorilla Dissolution\", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard\nrealizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving\nfor years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8\nfinale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another\nwoman, Mandy Chow ([Melissa Tang](/wiki/Melissa_Tang \"Melissa Tang\")) while on\nan expedition on the North Sea. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope\nin the season 9 premiere.\n\n### Sheldon and Amy's relationship\n\nIn the third-season finale, Raj and Howard search for a woman compatible with\nSheldon and discover [neurobiologist](/wiki/Neuroscientist \"Neuroscientist\")\nAmy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and\nparticipates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother.\nThis spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while\ninsisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In\n\"The Agreement Dissection\", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a\nnight of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed,\nSheldon says \"fascinating\" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \"The\nFlaming Spittoon Acquisition\". The same night he draws up \"The Relationship\nAgreement\" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa\n(similar to his \"Roommate Agreement\" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later\nregrets not having had a lawyer read through it.\n\nIn the episode \"The Launch Acceleration\", Amy tries to use her \"neurobiology\nbag of tricks\" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. In the\nfinal fifth-season episode \"The Countdown Reflection\", Sheldon takes Amy's\nhand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode \"The\nDate Night Variable\", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this\nexpectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over\nunless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic\nspeech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie.\nIn \"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\" Sheldon states that he has been working on\nhis discomfort about physical contact and admits that \"it's a possibility\"\nthat he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar\nfeelings in \"The Love Spell Potential\". Sheldon explains that he never thought\nabout intimacy with anyone before Amy.[83]\n\n\"The Locomotive Manipulation\" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates\na kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers\nthat he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up\nover the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy.\nHowever, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several\nchanges and Amy becomes distraught. However, in \"The Prom Equivalency\", he\nhides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the\nresulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he\nsurprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a\npanic attack.\n\nIn the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment\non their 5-year anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about\nthe future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to\nher. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she\nbreaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for\nthe next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the\nfirst time on Amy's birthday.\n\n### Howard's mother\n\nIn scenes set at Howard's home, he interacts with his rarely-seen mother\n(voiced by [Carol Ann Susi](/wiki/Carol_Ann_Susi \"Carol Ann Susi\") until her\ndeath) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts\nwith other characters in this manner.[84] She reflects the [Jewish mother\nstereotype](/wiki/Jewish_mother_stereotype \"Jewish mother stereotype\") in some\nways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes\ntrying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on\nHoward, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the\nmorning. Howard in turn is attached to his mother to the point where she still\ncuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and\n\"grounds\" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.[85] Until\nHoward's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale, Howard's former\nliving situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may\nsuffer from some type of pathology,[86] and Sheldon to refer to their\nrelationship as [Oedipal](/wiki/Oedipus_complex \"Oedipus complex\").[87] In\nseason 8, Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida, which devastates\nHoward and Stuart, who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz.\n\n### Vanity cards\n\nLike most shows created by Chuck Lorre, _The Big Bang Theory_ ends by showing\na [vanity card](/wiki/Production_logo \"Production logo\") written by Lorre\nafter the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These\ncards are archived on Lorre's website.[88]\n\n### _The Theorists_\n\nThrough the use of his [vanity cards](/wiki/Production_logo \"Production logo\")\nat the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been plagiarized by\na show produced and aired in [Belarus](/wiki/Belarus \"Belarus\"). Officially\ntitled _Теоретики_ (_The Theorists_), the show features \"clones\" of the main\ncharacters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close\nRussian translation of the scripts.[89] Lorre expressed annoyance and\ndescribed his inquiry with the Warner Bros. legal department about options.\nThe television production company and station's close relationship with the\nBelarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright\ninfringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is\noperated by the government.[90]\n\nHowever, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as\nsoon as it became known that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the\nproducers cancelled it.[91] Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's\ncounterpart, \"Seva\") said in an interview, \"I'm upset. At first, the actors\nwere told all legal issues were resolved. We didn't know it wasn't the case,\nso when the creators of _The Big Bang Theory_ started talking about the show,\nI was embarrassed. I can't understand why our people first do, and then think.\nI consider this to be the rock bottom of my career. And I don't want to take\npart in a stolen show\".[92]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical reception\n\nInitial reception for the series was mixed. The [review\naggregation](/wiki/Review_aggregator \"Review aggregator\") website [Rotten\nTomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\") reported a 55% approval\nrating for the first season based on reviews from 22 critics, with an average\nrating of 5.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"_The Big Bang\nTheory_ brings a new class of character to mainstream television, but much of\nthe comedy feels formulaic and stiff.\"[93] On [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic\n\"Metacritic\"), the season holds a score of 57 out of 100, based on reviews\nfrom 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[94] Later seasons\nreceived more acclaim and in 2013, _[TV Guide](/wiki/TV_Guide \"TV Guide\")_\nranked the series #52 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.[95]\n\n### U.S. standard ratings\n\n_The Big Bang Theory_ started off slowly in the ratings, failing to make the\ntop 50 in its first season (ranking 68th), and ranking 40th in its second\nseason. When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, however, _The\nBig Bang Theory_ ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the\nadults 18–49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83 million\nviewers.[96] After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday\nnights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the [2010–2011\nschedule](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_United_States_network_television_schedule\n\"2010–11 United States network television schedule\"), to be in direct\ncompetition with [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\")'s [Comedy Block](/wiki/Must_See_TV\n\"Must See TV\") and [Fox](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting\nCompany\")'s _[American Idol](/wiki/American_Idol \"American Idol\")_ (then the\nlongest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to\n2011).[97] During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated\ncomedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ _[Two and a Half\nMen](/wiki/Two_and_a_Half_Men \"Two and a Half Men\")_. However, in the age\n18–49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest\nrated comedy, behind [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American\nBroadcasting Company\")'s _[Modern Family](/wiki/Modern_Family \"Modern\nFamily\")_. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14\nmillion.[98]\n\nThe sixth season boasts some of the highest-rated episodes for the show so\nfar, with a then-new series high set with \"[The Bakersfield\nExpedition](/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_\\(season_6\\)#ep124 \"The Big Bang Theory\n\\(season 6\\)\")\", with 20 million viewers,[99] a first for the series, which\nalong with _[NCIS](/wiki/NCIS_\\(TV_series\\) \"NCIS \\(TV series\\)\")_ , made CBS\nthe first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in\nthe same week since 2007. In the sixth season, the show became the highest\nrated and viewed scripted show in the 18–49 demographic, trailing only the\nlive regular _[NBC Sunday Night Football](/wiki/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football \"NBC\nSunday Night Football\")_ coverage,[100][101] and was third in total viewers,\ntrailing _NCIS_ and _Sunday Night Football_.[102] Season seven of the series\nopened strong, continuing the success gained in season six, with the second\nepisode of the premiere, \"[The Deception\nVerification](/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_\\(season_7\\)#ep137 \"The Big Bang\nTheory \\(season 7\\)\")\", setting the new series high in viewers with 20.44\nmillion.[103][104]\n\nShowrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season,\ncredits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in [off-network\nsyndication](/wiki/Broadcast_syndication#Off-netowork_syndication \"Broadcast\nsyndication\"), particularly on [TBS](/wiki/TBS_\\(U.S._TV_channel\\) \"TBS \\(U.S.\nTV channel\\)\"), while Michael Schneider of _[TV Guide](/wiki/TV_Guide \"TV\nGuide\")_ attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre\nand CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the\ninfluence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly\nestablished regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as\nthe on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.[105]\nThroughout much of the 2012–13 season, _The Big Bang Theory_ placed first in\nall of syndication ratings, receiving formidable competition from only _[Judge\nJudy](/wiki/Judge_Judy \"Judge Judy\")_ and _[Wheel of\nFortune](/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_\\(U.S._game_show\\) \"Wheel of Fortune \\(U.S.\ngame show\\)\")_ ([first-run syndication](/wiki/First-run_syndication \"First-run\nsyndication\") programs).
