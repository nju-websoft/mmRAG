[Steve Perlman](/wiki/Steve_Perlman \"Steve\nPerlman\"), a close friend of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash in an\nenvelope, and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding.\nPerlman refused a stake in the company, and has stated \"I did it because I\nbelieved in the thing, and I wanted to help Andy.\"[18][19]\n\nIn July 2005,[15] [Google](/wiki/Google \"Google\") acquired Android Inc. for at\nleast $50 million.[20] Its key employees, including Rubin, Miner and White,\njoined Google as part of the acquisition.[15] Not much was known about the\nsecretive Android at the time, with the company having provided few details\nother than that it was making software for mobile phones.[15] At Google, the\nteam led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the [Linux\nkernel](/wiki/Linux_kernel \"Linux kernel\"). Google marketed the platform to\n[handset makers](/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer \"Original equipment\nmanufacturer\") and [carriers](/wiki/Mobile_network_operator \"Mobile network\noperator\") on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system.[21]\nGoogle had \"lined up a series of hardware components and software partners and\nsignaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of\ncooperation\".[_[attribution needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Attribution_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Attribution needed\")_][22]\n\nSpeculation about Google's intention to enter the mobile communications market\ncontinued to build through December 2006.[23] An early\n[prototype](/wiki/Prototype \"Prototype\") had a close resemblance to a\n[BlackBerry](/wiki/BlackBerry \"BlackBerry\") phone, with no touchscreen and a\nphysical [QWERTY](/wiki/QWERTY \"QWERTY\") [keyboard](/wiki/Computer_keyboard\n\"Computer keyboard\"), but the arrival of 2007's [Apple](/wiki/Apple_Inc.\n\"Apple Inc.\") [iPhone](/wiki/IPhone \"IPhone\") meant that Android \"had to go\nback to the drawing board\".[24][25] Google later changed its Android\nspecification documents to state that \"Touchscreens will be supported\",\nalthough \"the Product was designed with the presence of discrete physical\nbuttons as an assumption, therefore a touchscreen cannot completely replace\nphysical buttons\".[26] By 2008, both [Nokia](/wiki/Nokia \"Nokia\") and\nBlackBerry announced touch-based smartphones to rival the [iPhone\n3G](/wiki/IPhone_3G \"IPhone 3G\"), and Android's focus eventually switched to\njust touchscreens. The first commercially available smartphone running Android\nwas the [HTC Dream](/wiki/HTC_Dream \"HTC Dream\"), also known as T-Mobile G1,\nannounced on September 23, 2008.[27][28]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/HTC_Android_T-\nMobile_G1.jpg/200px-HTC_Android_T-Mobile_G1.jpg)](/wiki/File:HTC_Android_T-\nMobile_G1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HTC_Android_T-Mobile_G1.jpg \"St√¶kka\")\n\n[HTC Dream](/wiki/HTC_Dream \"HTC Dream\") or T-Mobile G1, the first\ncommercially released device running Android (2008).\n\nOn November 5, 2007, the [Open Handset Alliance](/wiki/Open_Handset_Alliance\n\"Open Handset Alliance\"), a [consortium](/wiki/Consortium \"Consortium\") of\ntechnology companies including Google, device manufacturers such as\n[HTC](/wiki/HTC \"HTC\"), [Motorola](/wiki/Motorola_Mobility \"Motorola\nMobility\") and [Samsung](/wiki/Samsung \"Samsung\"), wireless carriers such as\n[Sprint](/wiki/Sprint_Corporation \"Sprint Corporation\") and\n[T-Mobile](/wiki/T-Mobile_US \"T-Mobile US\"), and chipset makers such as\n[Qualcomm](/wiki/Qualcomm \"Qualcomm\") and [Texas\nInstruments](/wiki/Texas_Instruments \"Texas Instruments\"), unveiled itself,\nwith a goal to develop \"the first truly open and comprehensive platform for\nmobile devices\".[29][30][31] Within a year, the Open Handset Alliance faced\ntwo other [open source](/wiki/Open_source \"Open source\") competitors, the\n[Symbian Foundation](/wiki/Symbian_Foundation \"Symbian Foundation\") and the\n[LiMo Foundation](/wiki/LiMo_Foundation \"LiMo Foundation\"), the latter also\ndeveloping a [Linux](/wiki/Linux \"Linux\")-based mobile operating system like\nGoogle. In September 2007, _[InformationWeek](/wiki/InformationWeek\n\"InformationWeek\")_ covered an Evalueserve study reporting that Google had\nfiled several [patent](/wiki/Patent \"Patent\") applications in the area of\nmobile telephony.[32][33]\n\nSince 2008, Android has seen [numerous updates](/wiki/Android_version_history\n\"Android version history\") which have incrementally improved the operating\nsystem, adding new features and fixing [bugs](/wiki/Software_bug \"Software\nbug\") in previous releases. Each major release is named in alphabetical order\nafter a dessert or sugary treat, with the first few Android versions being\ncalled \"[Cupcake](/wiki/Cupcake \"Cupcake\")\", \"[Donut](/wiki/Donut \"Donut\")\",\n\"[Eclair](/wiki/Eclair \"Eclair\")\", and \"[Froyo](/wiki/Frozen_yogurt \"Frozen\nyogurt\")\", in that order. During its announcement of [Android\nKitKat](/wiki/Android_KitKat \"Android KitKat\") in 2013, Google explained that\n\"Since these devices make our lives so sweet, each Android version is named\nafter a dessert\", although a Google spokesperson told [CNN](/wiki/CNN \"CNN\")\nin an interview that \"It‚Äôs kind of like an internal team thing, and we prefer\nto be a little bit ‚Äî how should I say ‚Äî a bit inscrutable in the matter, I‚Äôll\nsay\".[34]\n\nIn 2010, Google launched its [Nexus](/wiki/Google_Nexus \"Google Nexus\") series\nof devices, a lineup in which Google partnered with different device\nmanufacturers to produce new devices and introduce new Android versions. The\nseries was described as having \"played a pivotal role in Android's history by\nintroducing new software iterations and hardware standards across the board\",\nand became known for its \"[bloat-free](/wiki/Software_bloat \"Software bloat\")\"\nsoftware with \"timely ... updates\".[35] At its [developer\nconference](/wiki/Google_I/O \"Google I/O\") in May 2013, Google announced a\nspecial version of the [Samsung Galaxy S4](/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S4 \"Samsung\nGalaxy S4\"), where, instead of using Samsung's own Android customization, the\nphone ran \"stock Android\" and was promised to receive new system updates\nfast.[36] The device would become the start of the [Google Play\nedition](/wiki/List_of_Google_Play_edition_devices \"List of Google Play\nedition devices\") program, and was followed by other devices, including the\n[HTC One](/wiki/HTC_One_\\(M7\\) \"HTC One \\(M7\\)\") Google Play edition,[37] and\n[Moto G](/wiki/Moto_G_\\(1st_generation\\) \"Moto G \\(1st generation\\)\") Google\nPlay edition.[38] In 2015, _[Ars Technica](/wiki/Ars_Technica \"Ars Technica\")_\nwrote that \"Earlier this week, the last of the Google Play edition Android\nphones in Google's online storefront were listed as \"no longer available for\nsale\" and that \"Now they're all gone, and it looks a whole lot like the\nprogram has wrapped up\".[39][40]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/A_Press_Conference_for_the_Launch_of_Nexus_7_on_September_27%2C_2012_in_Seoul_from_acrofan_3.JPG/220px-\nA_Press_Conference_for_the_Launch_of_Nexus_7_on_September_27%2C_2012_in_Seoul_from_acrofan_3.JPG)](/wiki/File:A_Press_Conference_for_the_Launch_of_Nexus_7_on_September_27,_2012_in_Seoul_from_acrofan_3.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:A_Press_Conference_for_the_Launch_of_Nexus_7_on_September_27,_2012_in_Seoul_from_acrofan_3.JPG\n\"St√¶kka\")\n\n[Eric Schmidt](/wiki/Eric_Schmidt \"Eric Schmidt\"), [Andy\nRubin](/wiki/Andy_Rubin \"Andy Rubin\") and [Hugo Barra](/wiki/Hugo_Barra \"Hugo\nBarra\") at a 2012 press conference announcing Google's Nexus 7 tablet\n\nFrom 2008 to 2013, [Hugo Barra](/wiki/Hugo_Barra \"Hugo Barra\") served as\nproduct spokesperson, representing Android at press conferences and [Google\nI/O](/wiki/Google_I/O \"Google I/O\"), Google‚Äôs annual developer-focused\nconference. He left Google in August 2013 to join Chinese phone maker\n[Xiaomi](/wiki/Xiaomi \"Xiaomi\").[41][42] Less than six months earlier,\nGoogle's then-[CEO](/wiki/CEO \"CEO\") [Larry Page](/wiki/Larry_Page \"Larry\nPage\") announced in a blog post that Andy Rubin had moved from the Android\ndivision to take on new projects at Google, and that [Sundar\nPichai](/wiki/Sundar_Pichai \"Sundar Pichai\") would become the new Android\nlead.[43][44] Pichai himself would eventually switch positions, becoming the\nnew CEO of Google in August 2015 following the company's restructure into the\n[Alphabet](/wiki/Alphabet_Inc. \"Alphabet Inc.\") conglomerate,[45][46] making\n[Hiroshi Lockheimer](/wiki/Hiroshi_Lockheimer \"Hiroshi Lockheimer\") the new\nhead of Android.[47][48]\n\nIn June 2014, Google announced [Android One](/wiki/Android_One \"Android One\"),\na set of \"hardware reference models\" that would \"allow [device makers] to\neasily create high-quality phones at low costs\", designed for consumers in\ndeveloping countries.[49][50][51] In September, Google announced the first set\nof Android One phones for release in India.[52][53] However,\n_[Recode](/wiki/Recode \"Recode\")_ reported in June 2015 that the project was\n\"a disappointment\", citing \"reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners\"\nand \"misfires from the search company that has never quite cracked\nhardware\".[54] Plans to relaunch Android One surfaced in August 2015,[55] with\nAfrica announced as the next location for the program a week later.[56][57] A\nreport from _The Information_ in January 2017 stated that Google is expanding\nits low-cost Android One program into the United States, although _The Verge_\nnotes that the company will presumably not produce the actual devices\nitself.[58][59]\n\nGoogle introduced the [Pixel and Pixel XL\nsmartphones](/wiki/Pixel_\\(smartphone\\) \"Pixel \\(smartphone\\)\") in October\n2016, marketed as being the first phones made by Google,[60][61] and\nexclusively featured certain software features, such as the [Google\nAssistant](/wiki/Google_Assistant \"Google Assistant\"), before wider\nrollout.[62][63] The Pixel phones replaced the Nexus series,[64] with a new\ngeneration of Pixel phones launched in October 2017.[65]\n\n## Features\n\nSee also: [List of features in Android](/wiki/List_of_features_in_Android\n\"List of features in Android\")\n\n### Interface\n\nAndroid's default user interface is mainly based on [direct\nmanipulation](/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface \"Direct manipulation\ninterface\"), using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions,\nlike swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen\nobjects, along with a [virtual keyboard](/wiki/Virtual_keyboard \"Virtual\nkeyboard\").[66] [Game controllers](/wiki/Game_controller \"Game controller\")\nand full-size physical [keyboards](/wiki/Computer_keyboard \"Computer\nkeyboard\") are supported via [Bluetooth](/wiki/Bluetooth \"Bluetooth\") or\n[USB](/wiki/USB \"USB\").[67][68] The response to user input is designed to be\nimmediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration\ncapabilities of the device to provide [haptic\nfeedback](/wiki/Haptic_technology \"Haptic technology\") to the user. Internal\nhardware, such as [accelerometers](/wiki/Accelerometer \"Accelerometer\"),\n[gyroscopes](/wiki/Gyroscope \"Gyroscope\") and [proximity\nsensors](/wiki/Proximity_sensor \"Proximity sensor\") are used by some\napplications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the\nscreen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented,[69]\nor allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a [racing game](/wiki/Racing_game\n\"Racing game\") by rotating the device, simulating control of a [steering\nwheel](/wiki/Steering_wheel \"Steering wheel\").[70]\n\nAndroid devices boot to the homescreen, the primary navigation and information\n\"hub\" on Android devices, analogous to the [desktop](/wiki/Desktop_metaphor\n\"Desktop metaphor\") found on personal computers. Android homescreens are\ntypically made up of app icons and [widgets](/wiki/Software_widget \"Software\nwidget\"); app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live,\nauto-updating content, such as a [weather forecast](/wiki/Weather_forecast\n\"Weather forecast\"), the user's email inbox, or a [news\nticker](/wiki/News_ticker \"News ticker\") directly on the homescreen.[71] A\nhomescreen may be made up of several pages, between which the user can swipe\nback and forth.[72] Third-party apps available on [Google\nPlay](/wiki/Google_Play \"Google Play\") and other app stores can extensively\nre-[theme](/wiki/Theme_\\(computing\\) \"Theme \\(computing\\)\") the\nhomescreen,[73] and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as\n[Windows Phone](/wiki/Windows_Phone \"Windows Phone\").[74] Most manufacturers\ncustomize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate\nthemselves from their competitors.[75]\n\nAlong the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the\ndevice and its connectivity. This status bar can be \"pulled\" down to reveal a\nnotification screen where apps display important information or updates.[72]\nNotifications are \"short, timely, and relevant information about your app when\nit‚Äôs not in use\", and when tapped, users are directed to a screen inside the\napp relating to the notification.[76] Beginning with [Android 4.1 \"Jelly\nBean\"](/wiki/Android_Jelly_Bean \"Android Jelly Bean\"), \"expandable\nnotifications\" allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for\nit to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from\nthe notification.[77]\n\nAn All Apps screen lists all installed applications, with the ability for\nusers to drag an app from the list onto the home screen. A Recents screen lets\nusers switch between recently used apps.[72]\n\n### Applications\n\nSee also: [Android software development](/wiki/Android_software_development\n\"Android software development\") and [Google Play](/wiki/Google_Play \"Google\nPlay\")\n\nApplications (\"[apps](/wiki/Mobile_app \"Mobile app\")\"), which extend the\nfunctionality of devices, are written using the [Android software\ndevelopment](/wiki/Android_software_development \"Android software\ndevelopment\") kit (SDK)[78] and, often, the\n[Java](/wiki/Java_\\(programming_language\\) \"Java \\(programming language\\)\")\nprogramming language.[79] Java may be combined with\n[C](/wiki/C_\\(programming_language\\) \"C \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\")/[C++](/wiki/C%2B%2B \"C++\"),[80] together with a choice of non-\ndefault [runtimes](/wiki/Runtime_library \"Runtime library\") that allow better\nC++ support.[81] The [Go](/wiki/Go_\\(programming_language\\) \"Go \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\") programming language is also supported, although with a limited\nset of [application programming\ninterfaces](/wiki/Application_programming_interface \"Application programming\ninterface\") (API).[82] In May 2017, Google announced support for Android app\ndevelopment in the [Kotlin programming\nlanguage](/wiki/Kotlin_\\(programming_language\\) \"Kotlin \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\").[83][84]\n\nThe SDK includes a comprehensive set of development tools,[85] including a\n[debugger](/wiki/Debugger \"Debugger\"), [software\nlibraries](/wiki/Software_library \"Software library\"), a handset\n[emulator](/wiki/Emulator \"Emulator\") based on [QEMU](/wiki/QEMU \"QEMU\"),\ndocumentation, sample code, and tutorials.

[Google Play Store](/wiki/Google_Play_Store\n\"Google Play Store\") is the primary application store installed on Android\ndevices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements and license the\nGoogle Mobile Services software.[87][88] Google Play Store allows users to\nbrowse, download and update applications published by Google and third-party\ndevelopers; as of July\n2013[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Android_\\(operating_system\\)&action=edit),\nthere are more than one million applications available for Android in Play\nStore.[89] As of July\n2013[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Android_\\(operating_system\\)&action=edit),\n50 billion applications have been installed.[90][91] Some carriers offer\ndirect carrier billing for Google Play application purchases, where the cost\nof the application is added to the user's monthly bill.[92] As of May 2017,\nthere are over one billion active users a month for Gmail, Android, Chrome,\nGoogle Play and Maps.\n\nDue to the open nature of Android, a number of third-party application\nmarketplaces also exist for Android, either to provide a substitute for\ndevices that are not allowed to ship with Google Play Store, provide\napplications that cannot be offered on Google Play Store due to policy\nviolations, or for other reasons. Examples of these third-party stores have\nincluded the [Amazon Appstore](/wiki/Amazon_Appstore \"Amazon Appstore\"),\n[GetJar](/wiki/GetJar \"GetJar\"), and SlideMe. [F-Droid](/wiki/F-Droid\n\"F-Droid\"), another alternative marketplace, seeks to only provide\napplications that are distributed under [free and open\nsource](/wiki/Free_and_open_source \"Free and open source\")\n[licenses](/wiki/Free_software_license \"Free software\nlicense\").[87][93][94][95]\n\n### Memory management\n\nSince Android devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to\nmanage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum. When an application\nis not in use the system [suspends its operation](/wiki/Process_state \"Process\nstate\") so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does\nnot use battery power or CPU resources.[96][97] Android manages the\napplications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system\nwill begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting\nwith those that have been inactive for the longest amount of time.[98][99]\nLifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task killer applications were\ndoing more harm than good.[100]\n\n## Hardware\n\nSee also: [Android hardware requirements](/wiki/Android_hardware_requirements\n\"Android hardware requirements\")\n\nThe main hardware platform for Android is [ARM](/wiki/ARM_architecture \"ARM\narchitecture\") (the [ARMv7](/wiki/ARMv7 \"ARMv7\") and [ARMv8-A](/wiki/ARMv8-A\n\"ARMv8-A\") architectures), with [x86](/wiki/X86 \"X86\"), [MIPS and\nMIPS64](/wiki/MIPS_architecture \"MIPS architecture\"), and\n[x86-64](/wiki/X86-64 \"X86-64\") architectures also officially supported in\nlater versions of Android.[101][102][103] The unofficial\n[Android-x86](/wiki/Android-x86 \"Android-x86\") project provided support for\nx86 architectures ahead of the official support.[104][105] The MIPS\narchitecture was also supported ahead of Google's support. Since 2012, Android\ndevices with [Intel](/wiki/Intel \"Intel\") processors began to appear,\nincluding phones[106] and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms,\nAndroid was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on [ARM64](/wiki/ARM64\n\"ARM64\"). Since Android 5.0 \"Lollipop\", [64-bit](/wiki/64-bit_computing\n\"64-bit computing\") variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the\n[32-bit](/wiki/32-bit \"32-bit\") variants.[101]\n\nRequirements for the minimum amount of [RAM](/wiki/Random-access_memory\n\"Random-access memory\") for devices running Android 7.1 range from in practice\n2 GB for best hardware, down to 1 GB for the most common screen, to absolute\nminimum 512 MB for the lowest spec 32-bit smartphone. The recommendation for\nAndroid 4.4 is to have at least 512 MB of RAM,[107] while for \"low RAM\"\ndevices 340 MB is the required minimum amount that does not include memory\ndedicated to various hardware components such as the [baseband\nprocessor](/wiki/Baseband_processor \"Baseband processor\").[108] Android 4.4\nrequires a [32-bit](/wiki/32-bit \"32-bit\") [ARMv7](/wiki/ARMv7 \"ARMv7\"),\n[MIPS](/wiki/MIPS_architecture \"MIPS architecture\") or [x86](/wiki/X86 \"X86\")\narchitecture processor (latter two through unofficial ports),[104][109]\ntogether with an [OpenGL ES](/wiki/OpenGL_ES \"OpenGL ES\") 2.0 compatible\n[graphics processing unit](/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit \"Graphics processing\nunit\") (GPU).[110] Android supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 and as of\nlatest major version, 3.2 and since Android 7.0 [Vulkan](/wiki/Vulkan_\\(API\\)\n\"Vulkan \\(API\\)\") (and version 1.1 available for some devices[111]). Some\napplications may explicitly require a certain version of the OpenGL ES, and\nsuitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications.[110]\n\nAndroid devices incorporate many optional hardware components, including still\nor video cameras, [GPS](/wiki/GPS \"GPS\"), [orientation\nsensors](/wiki/Orientation_sensing \"Orientation sensing\"), dedicated gaming\ncontrols, [accelerometers](/wiki/Accelerometer \"Accelerometer\"),\n[gyroscopes](/wiki/Gyroscope \"Gyroscope\"), barometers,\n[magnetometers](/wiki/Magnetometer \"Magnetometer\"), [proximity\nsensors](/wiki/Proximity_sensor \"Proximity sensor\"), [pressure\nsensors](/wiki/Pressure_sensor \"Pressure sensor\"), thermometers, and\n[touchscreens](/wiki/Touchscreen \"Touchscreen\"). Some hardware components are\nnot required, but became standard in certain classes of devices, such as\nsmartphones, and additional requirements apply if they are present. Some other\nhardware was initially required, but those requirements have been relaxed or\neliminated altogether. For example, as Android was developed initially as a\nphone OS, hardware such as microphones were required, while over time the\nphone function became optional.[91] Android used to require an\n[autofocus](/wiki/Autofocus \"Autofocus\") camera, which was relaxed to a\n[fixed-focus](/wiki/Fixed-focus_lens \"Fixed-focus lens\") camera[91] if present\nat all, since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when Android\nstarted to be used on [set-top boxes](/wiki/Set-top_box \"Set-top box\").\n\nIn addition to running on smartphones and tablets, several vendors run Android\nnatively on regular PC hardware with a keyboard and mouse.[112][113][114][115]\nIn addition to their availability on commercially available hardware, similar\nPC hardware-friendly versions of Android are freely available from the\nAndroid-x86 project, including customized Android 4.4.[116] Using the Android\n[emulator](/wiki/Emulator \"Emulator\") that is part of the [Android\nSDK](/wiki/Android_SDK \"Android SDK\"), or third-party emulators, Android can\nalso run non-natively on x86 architectures.[117][118] Chinese companies are\nbuilding a PC and mobile operating system, based on Android, to \"compete\ndirectly with Microsoft Windows and Google Android\".[119] The Chinese Academy\nof Engineering noted that \"more than a dozen\" companies were customising\nAndroid following a Chinese ban on the use of Windows 8 on government\nPCs.[120][121][122]\n\n## Development\n\nMain article: [Android software\ndevelopment](/wiki/Android_software_development \"Android software\ndevelopment\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Android_open_source_project.png/150px-\nAndroid_open_source_project.png)](/wiki/File:Android_open_source_project.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Android_open_source_project.png \"St√¶kka\")\n\nThe stack of Android Open Source Project\n\nAndroid is developed by [Google](/wiki/Google \"Google\") until the latest\nchanges and updates are ready to be released, at which point the [source\ncode](/wiki/Source_code \"Source code\") is made available to the Android Open\nSource Project (AOSP),[123] an [open source](/wiki/Open_source \"Open source\")\ninitiative led by Google.[124] The AOSP code can be found without modification\non select devices, mainly the [Nexus](/wiki/Google_Nexus \"Google Nexus\") and\n[Pixel](/wiki/Google_Pixel \"Google Pixel\") series of devices.[125] The source\ncode is, in turn, customized and adapted by [original equipment\nmanufacturers](/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer \"Original equipment\nmanufacturer\") (OEMs) to run on their hardware.[126][127] Also, Android's\nsource code does not contain the often proprietary [device\ndrivers](/wiki/Device_driver \"Device driver\") that are needed for certain\nhardware components.[128] As a result, most Android devices, including\nGoogle's own, ultimately ship with a combination of [free and open\nsource](/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software \"Free and open source software\")\nand [proprietary](/wiki/Proprietary_software \"Proprietary software\") software,\nwith the software required for accessing Google services falling into the\nlatter category.\n\n### Update schedule\n\nSee also: [Android version history](/wiki/Android_version_history \"Android\nversion history\")\n\nGoogle announces major incremental upgrades to Android on a yearly basis.[129]\nThe updates can be installed on devices [over-the-air](/wiki/Over-the-\nair_programming \"Over-the-air programming\").[130] The latest major release is\n[8.0 \"Oreo\"](/wiki/Android_Oreo \"Android Oreo\"), announced in March 2017,[131]\nand released the following August.[132][133]\n\nCompared to its primary rival mobile operating system,\n[Apple](/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\")'s [iOS](/wiki/IOS \"IOS\"), Android\nupdates typically reach various devices with significant delays. Except for\ndevices within the Google Nexus and Pixel brands, updates often arrive months\nafter the release of the new version, or not at all.[134] This was partly due\nto the extensive variation in [hardware](/wiki/Computer_hardware \"Computer\nhardware\") in Android devices,[135] to which each upgrade must be specifically\ntailored, a time- and resource-consuming process.[136] Manufacturers often\nprioritize their newest devices and leave old ones behind.[137] Additional\ndelays can be introduced by wireless carriers that, after receiving updates\nfrom manufacturers, further customize and brand Android to their needs and\nconduct extensive testing on their networks before sending the upgrade out to\nusers.[137][138] There are also situations in which upgrades are not possible\ndue to one manufacturing partner not providing necessary updates to\n[drivers](/wiki/Device_driver \"Device driver\").[139]\n\nThe extensive variation of hardware in Android devices causes significant\ndelays for software upgrades, with new versions of the operating system and\n[security patches](/wiki/Patch_\\(computing\\) \"Patch \\(computing\\)\") typically\ntaking months before reaching consumers, or sometimes not at all. The lack of\nafter-sale support from manufacturers and carriers has been widely criticized\nby consumer groups and the technology media.[140][141][142] Some commentators\nhave noted that the industry has a financial incentive not to upgrade their\ndevices, as the lack of updates for existing devices fuels the purchase of\nnewer ones,[143] an attitude described as \"insulting\".[142] _[The\nGuardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_ complained that the method of\ndistribution for updates is complicated only because manufacturers and\ncarriers have designed it that way.[142] In 2011, Google partnered with a\nnumber of industry players to announce an \"Android Update Alliance\", pledging\nto deliver timely updates for every device for 18 months after its release;\nhowever, there has not been another official word about that alliance since\nits announcement.[137][144]\n\nIn 2012, Google began decoupling certain aspects of the operating system\n(particularly its core applications) so they could be updated through the\n[Google Play](/wiki/Google_Play \"Google Play\") store independently of the OS.\nOne of those components, [Google Play Services](/wiki/Google_Play_Services\n\"Google Play Services\"), is a [closed-source](/wiki/Closed-source \"Closed-\nsource\") system-level process providing [APIs](/wiki/API \"API\") for Google\nservices, installed automatically on nearly all devices running [Android 2.2\n\"Froyo\"](/wiki/Android_Froyo \"Android Froyo\") and higher. With these changes,\nGoogle can add new system functionality through Play Services and update apps\nwithout having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself.[145]\nAs a result, [Android 4.2 and 4.3 \"Jelly Bean\"](/wiki/Android_Jelly_Bean\n\"Android Jelly Bean\") contained relatively fewer user-facing changes, focusing\nmore on minor changes and platform improvements.[146]\n\nIn May 2016, _[Bloomberg](/wiki/Bloomberg_Businessweek \"Bloomberg\nBusinessweek\")_ reported that Google was making efforts to keep Android more\nup-to-date, including accelerated rates of security updates, rolling out\ntechnological workarounds, reducing requirements for phone testing, and\nranking phone makers in an attempt to \"shame\" them into better behavior. As\nstated by _Bloomberg_ : \"As smartphones get more capable, complex and\nhackable, having the latest software work closely with the hardware is\nincreasingly important\". Hiroshi Lockheimer, the Android lead, admitted that\n\"It‚Äôs not an ideal situation\", further commenting that the lack of updates is\n\"the weakest link on security on Android\". Wireless carriers were described in\nthe report as the \"most challenging discussions\", due to carriers' slow\napproval time due to testing on their networks, despite some carriers,\nincluding [Verizon](/wiki/Verizon_Wireless \"Verizon Wireless\") and\n[Sprint](/wiki/Sprint_Corporation \"Sprint Corporation\"), having already\nshortened their respective approval times. [HTC](/wiki/HTC \"HTC\")'s then-\nexecutive Jason Mackenzie called monthly security updates \"unrealistic\" in\n2015, and Google was trying to persuade carriers to exclude security patches\nfrom the full testing procedures. In a further effort for persuasion, Google\nshared a list of top phone makers measured by updated devices with its Android\npartners, and is considering making the list public. Mike Chan, co-founder of\nphone maker Nextbit and former Android developer, said that \"The best way to\nsolve this problem is a massive re-architecture of the operating system\", \"or\nGoogle could invest in training manufacturers and carriers \"to be good Android\ncitizens\"\".[147][148][149]\n\nIn May 2017, with the announcement of [Android 8.0](/wiki/Android_Oreo\n\"Android Oreo\"), Google introduced Project Treble, a major re-architect of the\nAndroid OS framework designed to make it easier, faster, and less costly for\nmanufacturers to update devices to newer versions of Android. Project Treble\nseparates the vendor implementation (device-specific, lower-level software\nwritten by silicon manufacturers) from the Android OS framework via a new\n\"vendor interface\". In Android 7.0 and earlier, no formal vendor interface\nexists, so device makers must update large portions of the Android code to\nmove a device to a newer version of the operating system. With Treble, the new\nstable vendor interface provides access to the hardware-specific parts of\nAndroid, enabling device makers to deliver new Android releases simply by\nupdating the Android OS framework, \"without any additional work required from\nthe silicon manufacturers.\"[150]\n\nIn September 2017, Google's Project Treble team revealed that, as part of\ntheir efforts to improve the security lifecycle of Android devices, Google had\nmanaged to get the Linux Foundation to agree to extend the support lifecycle\nof the Linux Long-Term Support (LTS) kernel branch from the 2 years that it\nhas historically lasted to 6 years for future versions of the LTS kernel,\nstarting with Linux kernel 4.4.[151]\n\n### Linux kernel\n\nAndroid's [kernel](/wiki/Kernel_\\(computing\\) \"Kernel \\(computing\\)\") is based\non one of the [Linux kernel](/wiki/Linux_kernel \"Linux kernel\")'s [long-term\nsupport](/wiki/Long-term_support \"Long-term support\") (LTS) branches. As of\n2017, Android devices mainly use versions 3.18 or 4.4 of the Linux\nkernel.[152] The actual kernel depends on the individual device.[153]\n\nAndroid's variant of the Linux kernel has further architectural changes that\nare implemented by Google outside the typical Linux kernel development cycle,\nsuch as the inclusion of components like device trees, ashmem, ION, and\ndifferent [out of memory](/wiki/Out_of_memory \"Out of memory\") (OOM)\nhandling.[154][155] Certain features that Google contributed back to the Linux\nkernel, notably a power management feature called \"wakelocks\",[156] were\ninitially rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because they felt that\nGoogle did not show any intent to maintain its own code.[157][158] Google\nannounced in April 2010 that they would hire two employees to work with the\nLinux kernel community,[159] but [Greg Kroah-Hartman](/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman\n\"Greg Kroah-Hartman\"), the current Linux kernel maintainer for the stable\nbranch, said in December 2010 that he was concerned that Google was no longer\ntrying to get their code changes included in mainstream Linux.[158] Google\nengineer Patrick Brady once stated in the company's [developer\nconference](/wiki/Google_I/O \"Google I/O\") that \"Android is not Linux\",[160]\nwith _[Computerworld](/wiki/Computerworld \"Computerworld\")_ adding that \"Let\nme make it simple for you, without Linux, there is no Android\".[161] _[Ars\nTechnica](/wiki/Ars_Technica \"Ars Technica\")_ wrote that \"Although Android is\nbuilt on top of the Linux kernel, the platform has very little in common with\nthe conventional desktop Linux stack\".[160]\n\nIn August 2011, [Linus Torvalds](/wiki/Linus_Torvalds \"Linus Torvalds\") said\nthat \"eventually Android and Linux would come back to a common kernel, but it\nwill probably not be for four to five years\".[162] In December 2011, Greg\nKroah-Hartman announced the start of Android Mainlining Project, which aims to\nput some Android [drivers](/wiki/Device_driver \"Device driver\"), patches and\nfeatures back into the Linux kernel, starting in Linux 3.3.[163] Linux\nincluded the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 3.5 kernel, after\nmany previous attempts at merger. The interfaces are the same but the upstream\nLinux implementation allows for two different suspend modes: to memory (the\ntraditional suspend that Android uses), and to disk (hibernate, as it is known\non the desktop).[164] Google maintains a public code repository that contains\ntheir experimental work to [re-base](/wiki/Rebasing \"Rebasing\") Android off\nthe latest stable Linux versions.[165][166]\n\nThe [flash storage](/wiki/Flash_storage \"Flash storage\") on Android devices is\nsplit into several partitions, such as `/system` for the operating system\nitself, and `/data` for user data and application installations.[167] In\ncontrast to desktop Linux distributions, Android device owners are not given\n[root](/wiki/Superuser \"Superuser\") access to the operating system and\nsensitive partitions such as /system are [read-only](/wiki/Read-only_memory\n\"Read-only memory\"). However, [root\naccess](/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard \"Filesystem Hierarchy Standard\")\ncan be obtained by exploiting [security\nflaws](/wiki/Vulnerability_\\(computing\\) \"Vulnerability \\(computing\\)\") in\nAndroid, which is used frequently by the open-source community to enhance the\ncapabilities of their devices,[168] but also by malicious parties to install\n[viruses](/wiki/Computer_virus \"Computer virus\") and [malware](/wiki/Malware\n\"Malware\").[169]\n\nAndroid is a [Linux distribution](/wiki/Linux_distribution \"Linux\ndistribution\") according to the [Linux Foundation](/wiki/Linux_Foundation\n\"Linux Foundation\"),[170] Google's open-source chief [Chris\nDiBona](/wiki/Chris_DiBona \"Chris DiBona\"),[171] and several\njournalists.[172][173] Others, such as Google engineer Patrick Brady, say that\nAndroid is not Linux in the traditional [Unix-like](/wiki/Unix-like \"Unix-\nlike\") Linux distribution sense; Android does not include the [GNU C\nLibrary](/wiki/GNU_C_Library \"GNU C Library\") (it uses\n[Bionic](/wiki/Bionic_\\(software\\) \"Bionic \\(software\\)\") as an alternative C\nlibrary) and some of other components typically found in Linux\ndistributions.[174]\n\nWith the release of [Android Oreo](/wiki/Android_Oreo \"Android Oreo\") in 2017,\nGoogle began to require that devices shipped with new\n[SoCs](/wiki/System_on_a_chip \"System on a chip\") had Linux kernel version 4.4\nor newer, for security reasons. Existing devices upgraded to Oreo, and new\nproducts launched with older SoCs, were exempt from this rule.[175][176]\n\n### Software stack\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Android-System-\nArchitecture.svg/250px-Android-System-\nArchitecture.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Android-System-Architecture.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Android-System-Architecture.svg \"St√¶kka\")\n\nAndroid's architecture diagram\n\nOn top of the Linux kernel, there are the [middleware](/wiki/Middleware\n\"Middleware\"), [libraries](/wiki/Software_library \"Software library\") and\n[APIs](/wiki/Application_programming_interface \"Application programming\ninterface\") written in [C](/wiki/C_\\(programming_language\\) \"C \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\"), and [application software](/wiki/Application_software\n\"Application software\") running on an [application\nframework](/wiki/Application_framework \"Application framework\") which includes\n[Java](/wiki/Oracle_Java \"Oracle Java\")-compatible libraries. Development of\nthe Linux kernel continues independently of Android's other source code\nprojects.\n\nUntil version 5.0, Android used [Dalvik](/wiki/Dalvik_\\(software\\) \"Dalvik\n\\(software\\)\") as a [process virtual machine](/wiki/Process_virtual_machine\n\"Process virtual machine\") with [trace-based just-in-time (JIT)\ncompilation](/wiki/Tracing_just-in-time_compilation \"Tracing just-in-time\ncompilation\") to run Dalvik \"dex-code\" (Dalvik Executable), which is usually\ntranslated from the [Java bytecode](/wiki/Java_bytecode \"Java bytecode\").\nFollowing the trace-based JIT principle, in addition to\n[interpreting](/wiki/Interpreter_\\(computing\\) \"Interpreter \\(computing\\)\")\nthe majority of application code, Dalvik performs the compilation and [native\nexecution](/wiki/Machine_code \"Machine code\") of select frequently executed\ncode segments (\"traces\") each time an application is launched.[177][178][179]\nAndroid 4.4 introduced [Android Runtime](/wiki/Android_Runtime \"Android\nRuntime\") (ART) as a new runtime environment, which uses [ahead-of-time (AOT)\ncompilation](/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation \"Ahead-of-time compilation\") to\nentirely compile the application bytecode into [machine\ncode](/wiki/Machine_code \"Machine code\") upon the installation of an\napplication. In Android 4.4, ART was an experimental feature and not enabled\nby default; it became the only runtime option in the next major version of\nAndroid, 5.0.[180]\n\nFor its Java library, the Android platform uses a subset of the now\ndiscontinued [Apache Harmony](/wiki/Apache_Harmony \"Apache Harmony\")\nproject.[181] In December 2015, Google announced that the next version of\nAndroid would switch to a Java implementation based on the\n[OpenJDK](/wiki/OpenJDK \"OpenJDK\") project.[182]\n\nAndroid's [standard C library](/wiki/C_standard_library \"C standard library\"),\n[Bionic](/wiki/Bionic_\\(software\\) \"Bionic \\(software\\)\"), was developed by\nGoogle specifically for Android, as a derivation of the [BSD](/wiki/BSD\n\"BSD\")'s standard C library code. Bionic itself has been designed with several\nmajor features specific to the Linux kernel. The main benefits of using Bionic\ninstead of the [GNU C Library](/wiki/GNU_C_Library \"GNU C Library\") (glibc) or\n[uClibc](/wiki/UClibc \"UClibc\") are its smaller runtime footprint, and\noptimization for low-frequency CPUs. At the same time, Bionic is licensed\nunder the terms of the [BSD licence](/wiki/BSD_licence \"BSD licence\"), which\nGoogle finds more suitable for the Android's overall licensing model.[179]\n\nAiming for a different licensing model, toward the end of 2012, Google\nswitched the Bluetooth stack in Android from the GPL-licensed\n[BlueZ](/wiki/BlueZ \"BlueZ\") to the Apache-licensed BlueDroid.[183]\n\nAndroid does not have a native [X Window System](/wiki/X_Window_System \"X\nWindow System\") by default, nor does it support the full set of standard\n[GNU](/wiki/GNU \"GNU\") libraries. This made it difficult to port existing\nLinux applications or libraries to Android,[174] until version r5 of the\n[Android Native Development\nKit](/wiki/Android_software_development#Android_NDK \"Android software\ndevelopment\") brought support for applications written completely in\n[C](/wiki/C_\\(programming_language\\) \"C \\(programming language\\)\") or\n[C++](/wiki/C%2B%2B \"C++\").[184] Libraries written in C may also be used in\napplications by injection of a small [shim](/wiki/Shim_\\(computing\\) \"Shim\n\\(computing\\)\") and usage of the [JNI](/wiki/Java_Native_Interface \"Java\nNative Interface\").[185]\n\nSince Marshmallow, \"[Toybox](/wiki/Toybox \"Toybox\")\", a collection of command\nline utilities (mostly for use by apps, as Android doesn't provide a [command\nline interface](/wiki/Command_line_interface \"Command line interface\") by\ndefault), replaced similar \"Toolbox\" collection.[186]\n\nAndroid has another operating system, Trusty OS, within it, as a part of\n\"Trusty\" \"software components supporting a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)\non mobile devices.\" \"Trusty and the Trusty API are subject to change. [..]\nApplications for the Trusty OS can be written in C/C++ (C++ support is\nlimited), and they have access to a small C library. [..] All Trusty\napplications are single-threaded; multithreading in Trusty userspace currently\nis unsupported.

Community releases often come pre-[rooted](/wiki/Android_rooting\n\"Android rooting\") and contain modifications not provided by the original\nvendor, such as the ability to [overclock](/wiki/Overclock \"Overclock\") or\n[over/undervolt](/wiki/Dynamic_voltage_scaling \"Dynamic voltage scaling\") the\ndevice's processor.[190] [CyanogenMod](/wiki/CyanogenMod \"CyanogenMod\") was\nthe most widely used community firmware,[191] now discontinued and succeeded\nby [LineageOS](/wiki/LineageOS \"LineageOS\").[192]\n\nHistorically, device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been\nunsupportive of third-party [firmware](/wiki/Firmware \"Firmware\") development.\nManufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running\nunofficial software and the support costs resulting from this.[193] Moreover,\nmodified firmware such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features, such as\n[tethering](/wiki/Tethering \"Tethering\"), for which carriers would otherwise\ncharge a premium. As a result, technical obstacles including locked\n[bootloaders](/wiki/Bootloader \"Bootloader\") and restricted access to root\npermissions are common in many devices. However, as community-developed\nsoftware has grown more popular, and following a statement by the Librarian of\nCongress in the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") that\npermits the \"[jailbreaking](/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking \"IOS jailbreaking\")\" of\nmobile devices,[194] manufacturers and carriers have softened their position\nregarding third party development, with some, including [HTC](/wiki/HTC\n\"HTC\"),[193] [Motorola](/wiki/Motorola \"Motorola\"),[195]\n[Samsung](/wiki/Samsung \"Samsung\")[196][197] and\n[Sony](/wiki/Sony_Mobile_Communications \"Sony Mobile Communications\"),[198]\nproviding support and encouraging development. As a result of this, over time\nthe need to circumvent [hardware restrictions](/wiki/Hardware_restrictions\n\"Hardware restrictions\") to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an\nincreasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable\n[bootloaders](/wiki/Bootloader \"Bootloader\"), similar to\n[Nexus](/wiki/Google_Nexus \"Google Nexus\") series of phones, although usually\nrequiring that users waive their devices' warranties to do so.[193] However,\ndespite manufacturer acceptance, some carriers in the US still require that\nphones are locked down, frustrating developers and customers.[199]\n\n## Security and privacy\n\nSee also: [Mobile security](/wiki/Mobile_security \"Mobile security\") and\n[WARRIOR PRIDE](/wiki/WARRIOR_PRIDE \"WARRIOR PRIDE\")\n\n### Scope of surveillance by public institutions\n\nAs part of the broader [2013 mass surveillance\ndisclosures](/wiki/2013_mass_surveillance_disclosures \"2013 mass surveillance\ndisclosures\") it was revealed in September 2013 that the American and British\nintelligence agencies, the [National Security\nAgency](/wiki/National_Security_Agency \"National Security Agency\") (NSA) and\n[Government Communications\nHeadquarters](/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters \"Government\nCommunications Headquarters\") (GCHQ), respectively, have access to the user\ndata on iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android devices. They are reportedly able to\nread almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and\nnotes.[200] In January 2014, further reports revealed the intelligence\nagencies' capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted\nacross the Internet by social networks and other popular applications such as\n_[Angry Birds](/wiki/Angry_Birds \"Angry Birds\")_ , which collect personal\ninformation of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons. GCHQ\nhas, according to _[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_ , a\n[wiki](/wiki/Wiki \"Wiki\")-style guide of different apps and advertising\nnetworks, and the different data that can be siphoned from each.[201] Later\nthat week, the Finnish Angry Birds developer [Rovio](/wiki/Rovio_Entertainment\n\"Rovio Entertainment\") announced that it was reconsidering its relationships\nwith its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations, and called\nupon the wider industry to do the same.[202]\n\nThe documents revealed a further effort by the intelligence agencies to\nintercept Google Maps searches and queries submitted from Android and other\nsmartphones to collect location information in bulk.[201] The NSA and GCHQ\ninsist their activities are in compliance with all relevant domestic and\ninternational laws, although the Guardian stated \"the latest disclosures could\nalso add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects\nand uses information, especially for those outside the US, who enjoy fewer\nprivacy protections than Americans.\"[201]\n\nLeaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed [Vault 7](/wiki/Vault_7\n\"Vault 7\") and dated from 2013‚Äì2016, detail the capabilities of the [Central\nIntelligence Agency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency \"Central Intelligence\nAgency\") (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and [cyber\nwarfare](/wiki/Cyber_warfare \"Cyber warfare\"), including the ability to\ncompromise the operating systems of most smartphones (including\nAndroid).[203][204]\n\n### Common security threats\n\nResearch from security company [Trend Micro](/wiki/Trend_Micro \"Trend Micro\")\nlists premium service abuse as the most common type of Android malware, where\ntext messages are sent from infected phones to [premium-rate telephone\nnumbers](/wiki/Premium-rate_telephone_number \"Premium-rate telephone number\")\nwithout the consent or even knowledge of the user. Other malware displays\nunwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device, or sends personal\ninformation to unauthorised third parties.[205] Security threats on Android\nare reportedly growing exponentially; however, Google engineers have argued\nthat the malware and virus threat on Android is being\n[exaggerated](/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt \"Fear, uncertainty and doubt\")\nby security companies for commercial reasons,[206][207] and have accused the\nsecurity industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to\nusers.[206] Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely\nrare,[207] and a survey conducted by [F-Secure](/wiki/F-Secure \"F-Secure\")\nshowed that only 0.5% of Android malware reported had come from the Google\nPlay store.[208]\n\nIn August 2015, Google announced that devices in the [Google\nNexus](/wiki/Google_Nexus \"Google Nexus\") series would begin to receive\nmonthly security [patches](/wiki/Patch_\\(computing\\) \"Patch \\(computing\\)\").\nGoogle also wrote that \"Nexus devices will continue to receive major updates\nfor at least two years and security patches for the longer of three years from\ninitial availability or 18 months from last sale of the device via the [Google\nStore](/wiki/Google_Store \"Google Store\").\"[209][210][211] The following\nOctober, researchers at the [University of\nCambridge](/wiki/University_of_Cambridge \"University of Cambridge\") concluded\nthat 87.7% of Android phones in use had known but unpatched [security\nvulnerabilities](/wiki/Security_vulnerabilities \"Security vulnerabilities\")\ndue to lack of updates and support.[212][213][214] Ron Amadeo of _[Ars\nTechnica](/wiki/Ars_Technica \"Ars Technica\")_ wrote also in August 2015 that\n\"Android was originally designed, above all else, to be widely adopted. Google\nwas starting from scratch with zero percent market share, so it was happy to\ngive up control and give everyone a seat at the table in exchange for\nadoption. [...] Now, though, Android has around 75‚Äì80 percent of the worldwide\nsmartphone market‚Äîmaking it not just the world's most popular mobile operating\nsystem but arguably the most popular operating system, period. As such,\nsecurity has become a big issue. Android still uses a software update chain-\nof-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to\nupdate, and it just doesn't work\".[215] Following news of Google's monthly\nschedule, some manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, promised to issue\nmonthly security updates,[216] but, as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in _Android\nCentral_ in February 2016, \"instead we got a few updates on specific versions\nof a small handful of models. And a bunch of broken promises\".[217]\n\nIn a March 2017 post on Google's Security Blog, Android security leads Adrian\nLudwig and Mel Miller wrote that \"More than 735 million devices from 200+\nmanufacturers received a platform security update in 2016\" and that \"Our\ncarrier and hardware partners helped expand deployment of these updates,\nreleasing updates for over half of the top 50 devices worldwide in the last\nquarter of 2016\". They also wrote that \"About half of devices in use at the\nend of 2016 had not received a platform security update in the previous year\",\nstating that their work would continue to focus on streamlining the security\nupdates program for easier deployment by manufacturers.[218] Furthermore, in a\ncomment to _[TechCrunch](/wiki/TechCrunch \"TechCrunch\")_ , Ludwig stated that\nthe wait time for security updates had been reduced from \"six to nine weeks\ndown to just a few days\", with 78% of flagship devices in North America being\nup-to-date on security at the end of 2016.[219]\n\nPatches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of\nolder and lower-priced devices.[220][221] However, the open-source nature of\nAndroid allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them\nfor highly secure uses. For example, Samsung has worked with General Dynamics\nthrough their [Open Kernel Labs](/wiki/Open_Kernel_Labs \"Open Kernel Labs\")\nacquisition to rebuild _Jelly Bean_ on top of their hardened microvisor for\nthe \"Knox\" project.[222][223]\n\nAndroid smartphones have the ability to report the location of [Wi-\nFi](/wiki/Wi-Fi \"Wi-Fi\") access points, encountered as phone users move\naround, to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of\nmillions of such access points. These databases form electronic maps to locate\nsmartphones, allowing them to run apps like [Foursquare](/wiki/Foursquare\n\"Foursquare\"), [Google Latitude](/wiki/Google_Latitude \"Google Latitude\"),\n[Facebook Places](/wiki/Facebook_Places \"Facebook Places\"), and to deliver\nlocation-based ads.[224] Third party monitoring software such as\nTaintDroid,[225] an academic research-funded project, can, in some cases,\ndetect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote\nservers.[226]\n\n### Technical security features\n\nAndroid applications run in a [sandbox](/wiki/Sandbox_\\(computer_security\\)\n\"Sandbox \\(computer security\\)\"), an isolated area of the system that does not\nhave access to the rest of the system's resources, unless access permissions\nare explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed, however\nthis may not be possible for pre-installed apps. It is not possible, for\nexample, to turn off the microphone access of the pre-installed camera app\nwithout disabling the camera completely. This is valid also in Android\nversions 7 and 8.[227]\n\nSince February 2012, Google has used its [Google Bouncer](/wiki/Google_Bouncer\n\"Google Bouncer\") [malware](/wiki/Malware \"Malware\") scanner to watch over and\nscan apps available in the Google Play store.[228][229] A \"Verify Apps\"\nfeature was introduced in November 2012, as part of the [Android 4.2 \"Jelly\nBean\"](/wiki/Android_Jelly_Bean \"Android Jelly Bean\") operating system\nversion, to scan all apps, both from Google Play and from third-party sources,\nfor malicious behavior.[230] Originally only doing so during installation,\nVerify Apps received an update in 2014 to \"constantly\" scan apps, and in 2017\nthe feature was made visible to users through a menu in Settings.[231][232]\n\nBefore installing an application, the [Google Play](/wiki/Google_Play \"Google\nPlay\") store displays a list of the requirements an app needs to function.\nAfter reviewing these permissions, the user can choose to accept or refuse\nthem, installing the application only if they accept.[233] In [Android 6.0\n\"Marshmallow\"](/wiki/Android_Marshmallow \"Android Marshmallow\"), the\npermissions system was changed; apps are no longer automatically granted all\nof their specified permissions at installation time. An opt-in system is used\ninstead, in which users are prompted to grant or deny individual permissions\nto an app when they are needed for the first time. Applications remember the\ngrants, which can be revoked by the user at any time. Pre-installed apps,\nhowever, are not always part of this approach. In some cases it may not be\npossible to deny certain permissions to pre-installed apps, nor be possible to\ndisable them. The Google Play Services app cannot be uninstalled, nor\ndisabled. Any force stop attempt, result in the app restarting\nitself.[234][235] The new permissions model is used only by applications\ndeveloped for Marshmallow using its [software development\nkit](/wiki/Software_development_kit \"Software development kit\") (SDK), and\nolder apps will continue to use the previous all-or-nothing approach.\nPermissions can still be revoked for those apps, though this might prevent\nthem from working properly, and a warning is displayed to that\neffect.[236][237]\n\nIn September 2014, Jason Nova of _Android Authority_ reported on a study by\nthe German security company Fraunhofer AISEC in [antivirus\nsoftware](/wiki/Antivirus_software \"Antivirus software\") and malware threats\non Android. Nova wrote that \"The Android operating system deals with software\npackages by sandboxing them; this does not allow applications to list the\ndirectory contents of other apps to keep the system safe. By not allowing the\nantivirus to list the directories of other apps after installation,\napplications that show no inherent suspicious behavior when downloaded are\ncleared as safe. If then later on parts of the app are activated that turn out\nto be malicious, the antivirus will have no way to know since it is inside the\napp and out of the antivirus‚Äô jurisdiction\". The study by Fraunhofer AISEC,\nexamining antivirus software from [Avast](/wiki/Avast_Software \"Avast\nSoftware\"), [AVG](/wiki/AVG_AntiVirus \"AVG AntiVirus\"),\n[Bitdefender](/wiki/Bitdefender \"Bitdefender\"), [ESET](/wiki/ESET \"ESET\"),\n[F-Secure](/wiki/F-Secure \"F-Secure\"), [Kaspersky](/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab\n\"Kaspersky Lab\"),\n[Lookout](/w/index.php?title=Lookout_\\(company\\)&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Lookout \\(company\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\"), [McAfee (formerly Intel\nSecurity)](/wiki/McAfee \"McAfee\"), [Norton](/wiki/Norton_\\(Symantec\\) \"Norton\n\\(Symantec\\)\"), [Sophos](/wiki/Sophos \"Sophos\"), and [Trend\nMicro](/wiki/Trend_Micro \"Trend Micro\"), revealed that \"the tested antivirus\napps do not provide protection against customized malware or targeted\nattacks\", and that \"the tested antivirus apps were also not able to detect\nmalware which is completely unknown to date but does not make any efforts to\nhide its malignity\".[238]\n\nIn August 2013, Google announced Android Device Manager (renamed Find My\nDevice in May 2017),[239][240] a service that allows users to remotely track,\nlocate, and wipe their Android device,[241][242] with an Android app for the\nservice released in December.[243][244] In December 2016, Google introduced a\nTrusted Contacts app, letting users request location-tracking of loved ones\nduring emergencies.[245][246]\n\n  \n\n## Licensing\n\nThe [source code](/wiki/Source_code \"Source code\") for Android is [open-\nsource](/wiki/Open-source \"Open-source\"): it is developed in private by\nGoogle, with the source code released publicly when a new version of Android\nis released. Google publishes most of the code (including network and\ntelephony [stacks](/wiki/Solution_stack \"Solution stack\")) under the [non-\ncopyleft](/wiki/Non-copyleft \"Non-copyleft\") [Apache\nLicense](/wiki/Apache_License \"Apache License\") version 2.0. which allows\nmodification and redistribution.[247][248] The license does not grant rights\nto the \"Android\" trademark, so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have\nto license it from Google under individual contracts. Associated Linux kernel\nchanges are released under the [copyleft](/wiki/Copyleft \"Copyleft\") [GNU\nGeneral Public License](/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License \"GNU General Public\nLicense\") version 2, developed by the [Open Handset\nAlliance](/wiki/Open_Handset_Alliance \"Open Handset Alliance\"), with the\nsource code publicly available at all times. Typically, Google collaborates\nwith a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device (part of the Nexus\nseries) featuring the new version of Android, then makes the source code\navailable after that device has been released.[249] The only Android release\nwhich was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet-only\n3.0 _Honeycomb_ release. The reason, according to [Andy\nRubin](/wiki/Andy_Rubin \"Andy Rubin\") in an official Android blog post, was\nbecause _Honeycomb_ was rushed for production of the [Motorola\nXoom](/wiki/Motorola_Xoom \"Motorola Xoom\"),[250] and they did not want third\nparties creating a \"really bad user experience\" by attempting to put onto\nsmartphones a version of Android intended for tablets.[251]\n\nOnly the base Android operating system (including some applications) is open-\nsource software, whereas most Android devices ship with a substantial amount\nof proprietary software, such as [Google Mobile\nServices](/wiki/Google_Mobile_Services \"Google Mobile Services\"), which\nincludes applications such as [Google Play Store](/wiki/Google_Play_Store\n\"Google Play Store\"), Google Search, and [Google Play\nServices](/wiki/Google_Play_Services \"Google Play Services\") ‚Äì a software\nlayer that provides [APIs](/wiki/Application_programming_interface\n\"Application programming interface\") for the integration with Google-provided\nservices, among others. These applications must be licensed from Google by\ndevice makers, and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility\nguidelines and other requirements.[88] Custom, certified distributions of\nAndroid produced by manufacturers (such as [TouchWiz](/wiki/TouchWiz\n\"TouchWiz\") and [HTC Sense](/wiki/HTC_Sense \"HTC Sense\")) may also replace\ncertain stock Android apps with their own proprietary variants and add\nadditional software not included in the stock Android operating system.[87]\nThere may also be \"[binary blob](/wiki/Binary_blob \"Binary blob\")\"\n[drivers](/wiki/Driver_\\(software\\) \"Driver \\(software\\)\") required for\ncertain hardware components in the device.[87][128]\n\n[Richard Stallman](/wiki/Richard_Stallman \"Richard Stallman\") and the [Free\nSoftware Foundation](/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation \"Free Software\nFoundation\") have been critical of Android and have recommended the usage of\nalternatives such as [Replicant](/wiki/Replicant_\\(operating_system\\)\n\"Replicant \\(operating system\\)\"), because drivers and firmware vital for the\nproper functioning of Android devices are usually proprietary, and because the\nGoogle Play Store application can forcibly install or deinstall applications\nand, as a result, invite non-free software; although the Free Software\nFoundation has not found Google to use it for malicious reasons.[252][253]\n\n### Leverage over manufacturers\n\nGoogle licenses their Google Mobile Services software, along with Android\ntrademarks, only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet Google's\ncompatibility standards specified in the Android Compatibility Program\ndocument.[254] Thus, forks of Android that make major changes to the operating\nsystem itself do not include any of Google's non-free components, stay\nincompatible with applications that require them, and must ship with an\nalternative software marketplace in lieu of Google Play Store.[87] Examples of\nsuch Android forks are [Amazon](/wiki/Amazon.com \"Amazon.com\")'s [Fire\nOS](/wiki/Fire_OS \"Fire OS\") (which is used on the [Kindle\nFire](/wiki/Kindle_Fire \"Kindle Fire\") line of tablets, and oriented toward\nAmazon services), the [Nokia X Software\nPlatform](/wiki/Nokia_X_Software_Platform \"Nokia X Software Platform\") (a fork\nused by the [Nokia X family](/wiki/Nokia_X_family \"Nokia X family\"), oriented\nprimarily toward [Nokia](/wiki/Nokia \"Nokia\") and [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft\n\"Microsoft\") services), and other forks that exclude Google apps due to the\ngeneral unavailability of Google services in certain regions (such as\n[China](/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China\n\"Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China\")).[255][256] In 2014,\nGoogle also began to require that all Android devices which license the Google\nMobile Services software display a prominent \"Powered by Android\" logo on\ntheir boot screens.[88] Google has also enforced preferential bundling and\nplacement of Google Mobile Services on devices, including mandated bundling of\nthe entire main suite of Google applications, and that shortcuts to Google\nSearch and the Play Store app must be present on or near the main home screen\npage in its default configuration.[257]\n\nSome stock applications and components in AOSP code that were formerly used by\nearlier versions of Android, such as Search, Music, Calendar, and the location\nAPI, were [abandoned](/wiki/Deprecation \"Deprecation\") by Google in favor of\n[non-free](/wiki/Proprietary_software \"Proprietary software\") replacements\ndistributed through Play Store (Google Search, Google Play Music, and Google\nCalendar) and [Google Play Services](/wiki/Google_Play_Services \"Google Play\nServices\"), which are no longer open-source. Moreover, open-source variants of\nsome applications also exclude functions that are present in their non-free\nversions, such as Photosphere panoramas in Camera, and a [Google\nNow](/wiki/Google_Now \"Google Now\") page on the default home screen (exclusive\nto the proprietary version \"Google Now Launcher\", whose code is embedded\nwithin that of the main Google application).[87][258][259][260] These measures\nare likely intended to discourage forks, as more of the operating system's\ncore functionality (and in turn, third-party software), are dependent on\nproprietary components licensed exclusively by Google, and it would take\nsignificant development resources to develop an alternative suite of software\nand APIs to replicate or replace them. Apps that do not utilize Google\ncomponents would also be at a functional disadvantage, as they can only\nutilize APIs contained within the OS itself.[261]\n\nIn March 2018, it was reported that Google had begun to block \"uncertified\"\nAndroid devices from utilizing Google Mobile Services software, and display a\nwarning indicating that \"the device manufacturer has preloaded Google apps and\nservices without certification from Google\". Users of custom ROMs are able to\nregister their device ID to their Google account to remove this block.[262]\n\nMembers of the Open Handset Alliance, which include the majority of Android\nOEMs, are also contractually forbidden from producing Android devices based on\nforks of the OS;[87][263] in 2012, [Acer Inc.](/wiki/Acer_Inc. \"Acer Inc.\")\nwas forced by Google to halt production on a device powered by [Alibaba\nGroup](/wiki/Alibaba_Group \"Alibaba Group\")'s [Aliyun OS](/wiki/Aliyun_OS\n\"Aliyun OS\") with threats of removal from the OHA, as Google deemed the\nplatform to be an incompatible version of Android. Alibaba Group defended the\nallegations, arguing that the OS was a distinct platform from Android\n(primarily using [HTML5](/wiki/HTML5 \"HTML5\") apps), but incorporated portions\nof Android's platform to allow backwards compatibility with third-party\nAndroid software. Indeed, the devices did ship with an application store which\noffered Android apps; however, the majority of them were\n[pirated](/wiki/Software_piracy \"Software piracy\").[264][265][266]\n\n## Reception\n\nAndroid received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007. Although\nanalysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had\npartnered with Google to form the Open Handset Alliance, it was unclear\nwhether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing\noperating systems with Android.[267] The idea of an open-source, Linux-based\n[development platform](/wiki/Computing_platform \"Computing platform\") sparked\ninterest,[268] but there were additional worries about Android facing strong\ncompetition from established players in the smartphone market, such as Nokia\nand Microsoft, and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in\ndevelopment.[269] These established players were skeptical:\n[Nokia](/wiki/Nokia \"Nokia\") was quoted as saying \"we don't see this as a\nthreat,\" and a member of Microsoft's Windows Mobile team stated \"I don't\nunderstand the impact that they are going to have.\"[270]\n\nSince then Android has grown to become the most widely used smartphone\noperating system[271][272] and \"one of the fastest mobile experiences\navailable\".[273] Reviewers have highlighted the open-source nature of the\noperating system as one of its defining strengths, allowing companies such as\n[Nokia](/wiki/Nokia \"Nokia\") ([Nokia X family](/wiki/Nokia_X_family \"Nokia X\nfamily\")),[274] [Amazon](/wiki/Amazon.com \"Amazon.com\") ([Kindle\nFire](/wiki/Kindle_Fire \"Kindle Fire\")), [Barnes &\nNoble](/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble \"Barnes & Noble\")\n([Nook](/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble_Nook \"Barnes & Noble Nook\")), [Ouya](/wiki/Ouya\n\"Ouya\"), [Baidu](/wiki/Baidu \"Baidu\") and others to\n[fork](/wiki/Fork_\\(software_development\\) \"Fork \\(software development\\)\")\nthe software and release hardware running their own customised version of\nAndroid. As a result, it has been described by technology website _[Ars\nTechnica](/wiki/Ars_Technica \"Ars Technica\")_ as \"practically the default\noperating system for launching new hardware\" for companies without their own\nmobile platforms.[271] This openness and flexibility is also present at the\nlevel of the end user: Android allows extensive customisation of devices by\ntheir owners and apps are freely available from non-Google app stores and\nthird party websites. These have been cited as among the main advantages of\nAndroid phones over others.[271][275]\n\nDespite Android's popularity, including an activation rate three times that of\niOS, there have been reports that Google has not been able to leverage their\nother products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money\nmaker that analysts had expected.[276] _[The Verge](/wiki/The_Verge \"The\nVerge\")_ suggested that Google is losing control of Android due to the\nextensive customization and proliferation of non-Google apps and services ‚Äì\nAmazon's Kindle Fire line uses [Fire OS](/wiki/Fire_OS \"Fire OS\"), a heavily\nmodified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google's\nproprietary components, and requires that users obtain software from its\ncompeting [Amazon Appstore](/wiki/Amazon_Appstore \"Amazon Appstore\") instead\nof Play Store.[87] In 2014, in an effort to improve prominence of the Android\nbrand, Google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary\ncomponents display an Android logo on the boot screen.[88]\n\nAndroid has suffered from \"fragmentation\",[277] a situation where the variety\nof Android devices, in terms of both hardware variations and differences in\nthe software running on them, makes the task of developing applications that\nwork consistently across the ecosystem harder than rival platforms such as iOS\nwhere hardware and software varies less. For example, according to data from\n[OpenSignal](/wiki/OpenSignal \"OpenSignal\") in July 2013, there were 11,868\nmodels of Android device, numerous different screen sizes and eight Android OS\nversions simultaneously in use, while the large majority of iOS users have\nupgraded to the latest iteration of that OS.[278] Critics such as [Apple\nInsider](/wiki/Apple_Insider \"Apple Insider\") have asserted that fragmentation\nvia hardware and software pushed Android's growth through large volumes of low\nend, budget-priced devices running older versions of Android. They maintain\nthis forces Android developers to write for the \"lowest common denominator\" to\nreach as many users as possible, who have too little incentive to make use of\nthe latest hardware or software features only available on a smaller\npercentage of devices.[279] However, OpenSignal, who develops both Android and\niOS apps, concluded that although fragmentation can make development trickier,\nAndroid's wider global reach also increases the potential reward.[278]\n\n### Market share\n\nMain article: [Usage share of operating\nsystems](/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems \"Usage share of operating\nsystems\")\n\nResearch company Canalys estimated in the second quarter of 2009, that Android\nhad a 2.8% share of worldwide [smartphone](/wiki/Smartphone \"Smartphone\")\nshipments.[280] By May 2010, Android had a 10% worldwide smartphone market\nshare, overtaking [Windows Mobile](/wiki/Windows_Mobile \"Windows\nMobile\"),[281] whilst in the US Android held a 28% share, overtaking [iPhone\nOS](/wiki/IPhone_OS \"IPhone OS\").[282] By the fourth quarter of 2010, its\nworldwide share had grown to 33% of the market becoming the top-selling\nsmartphone platform,[283] overtaking [Symbian](/wiki/Symbian \"Symbian\").[284]\nIn the US it became the top-selling platform in April 2011, overtaking\n[BlackBerry OS](/wiki/BlackBerry_OS \"BlackBerry OS\") with a 31.2% smartphone\nshare, according to _comScore_.[285]\n\nBy the third quarter of 2011, [Gartner](/wiki/Gartner \"Gartner\") estimated\nthat more than half (52.5%) of the smartphone sales belonged to Android.[286]\nBy the third quarter of 2012 Android had a 75% share of the global smartphone\nmarket according to the research firm IDC.[287]\n\nIn July 2011, Google said that 550,000 Android devices were being activated\nevery day,[288] up from 400,000 per day in May,[289] and more than 100 million\ndevices had been activated[290] with 4.4% growth per week.[288] In September\n2012, 500 million devices had been activated with 1.3 million activations per\nday.[291][292] In May 2013, at [Google I/O](/wiki/Google_I/O \"Google I/O\"),\nSundar Pichai announced that 900 million Android devices had been\nactivated.[293]\n\nAndroid market share varies by location. In July 2012, \"mobile subscribers\naged 13+\" in the United States using Android were up to 52%,[294] and rose to\n90% in China.[295] During the third quarter of 2012, Android's worldwide\nsmartphone shipment market share was 75%,[287] with 750 million devices\nactivated in total. In April 2013 Android had 1.5 million activations per\nday.[292] As of May\n2013[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Android_\\(operating_system\\)&action=edit),\n48 billion applications (\"apps\") have been installed from the Google Play\nstore,[296] and by September 2013, one billion Android devices have been\nactivated.[297]\n\nAs of February\n2017[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Android_\\(operating_system\\)&action=edit),\nthe [Google Play](/wiki/Google_Play \"Google Play\") store has over 2.7 million\nAndroid applications published,[298] and As of May\n2016[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Android_\\(operating_system\\)&action=edit),\napps have been downloaded more than 65 billion times.[299] The operating\nsystem's success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so-\ncalled \"[smartphone wars](/wiki/Smartphone_patent_wars \"Smartphone patent\nwars\")\" between technology companies.[300][301]\n\nAndroid devices account for more than half of smartphone sales in most\nmarkets, including the US, while \"only in Japan was Apple on top\"\n(September‚ÄìNovember 2013 numbers).[302] At the end of 2013, over 1.5 billion\nAndroid smartphones have been sold in the four years since 2010,[303][304]\nmaking Android the most sold phone and tablet OS. Three billion Android\nsmartphones are estimated to be sold by the end of 2014 (including previous\nyears). According to Gartner research company, Android-based devices outsold\nall contenders, every year since 2012.[305] In 2013, it outsold Windows 2.8:1\nor by 573 million.[306][307][308] As of\n2015[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Android_\\(operating_system\\)&action=edit),\nAndroid has the largest [installed base](/wiki/Installed_base \"Installed\nbase\") of all operating systems;[20] Since 2013, devices running it also sell\nmore than Windows, iOS and Mac OS X devices combined.[309]\n\nAccording to [StatCounter](/wiki/StatCounter \"StatCounter\"), which tracks only\nthe use for browsing the web, Android is the most popular mobile operating\nsystem since August 2013.[310] Android is the most popular operating system\nfor web browsing in India and several other countries (e.g. virtually all of\nAsia, with Japan and North Korea exceptions). According to StatCounter,\nAndroid is most used on mobile in all African countries, and it stated \"mobile\nusage has already overtaken desktop in several countries including India,\nSouth Africa and Saudi Arabia\",[311] with virtually all countries in Africa\nhaving done so already (except for seven countries, including Egypt), such as\nEthiopia and Kenya in which mobile (including tablets) usage is at 90.46%\n(Android only, accounts for 75.81% of all use there).[312][313]\n\nWhile Android phones in the [Western world](/wiki/Western_world \"Western\nworld\") commonly include Google's proprietary add-ons (such as Google Play) to\nthe otherwise open-source operating system, this is increasingly not the case\nin emerging markets; \"ABI Research claims that 65 million devices shipped\nglobally with open-source Android in the second quarter of [2014], up from 54\nmillion in the first quarter\"; depending on country, percent of phones\nestimated to be based only on AOSP source code, forgoing the Android\ntrademark: Thailand (44%), Philippines (38%), Indonesia (31%), India (21%),\nMalaysia (24%), Mexico (18%), Brazil (9%).[314]\n\nAccording to a January 2015 [Gartner](/wiki/Gartner \"Gartner\") report,\n\"Android surpassed a billion shipments of devices in 2014, and will continue\nto grow at a double-digit pace in 2015, with a 26 percent increase year over\nyear.\" This made it the first time that any general-purpose operating system\nhas reached more than one billion end users within a year: by reaching close\nto 1.16 billion end users in 2014, Android shipped over four times more than\n[iOS](/wiki/IOS \"IOS\") and [OS X](/wiki/OS_X \"OS X\") combined, and over three\ntimes more than [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft\nWindows\"). Gartner expected the whole mobile phone market to \"reach two\nbillion units in 2016\", including Android.[315] Describing the statistics,\nFarhad Manjoo wrote in _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New\nYork Times\")_ that \"About one of every two computers sold today is running\nAndroid. [It] has become Earth's dominant computing platform.\"[20]\n\nAccording to a [Statistica](/wiki/Statistica \"Statistica\")'s estimate, Android\nsmartphones had an installed base of 1.8 billion units in 2015, which was 76%\nof the estimated total number of smartphones worldwide.[316][317][a] Android\nhas the largest installed base of any [mobile operating\nsystem](/wiki/Mobile_operating_system \"Mobile operating system\") and, since\n2013, the highest-selling operating system overall[306][309][319][320][321]\nwith sales in 2012, 2013 and 2014[322] close to the installed base of all\nPCs.[323]\n\nIn the second quarter of 2014, Android's share of the global smartphone\nshipment market was 84.7%, a new record.[324][325] This had grown to 87.5%\nworldwide market share by the third quarter of 2016,[326] leaving main\ncompetitor [iOS](/wiki/IOS \"IOS\") with 12.1% market share.[327]\n\nAccording to an April 2017 [StatCounter](/wiki/StatCounter \"StatCounter\")\nreport, Android overtook Microsoft Windows to become the most popular\noperating system for total Internet usage.[328][329] It has maintained the\nplurality since then.[330]\n\nIn September 2015, Google announced that Android had 1.4 billion monthly\nactive users.[331][332] This changed to 2 billion monthly active users in May\n2017.[333][334]\n\n### Adoption on tablets\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Front_view_of_Nexus_7_%28cropped%29.png/150px-\nFront_view_of_Nexus_7_%28cropped%29.png)](/wiki/File:Front_view_of_Nexus_7_\\(cropped\\).png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Front_view_of_Nexus_7_\\(cropped\\).png \"St√¶kka\")\n\nThe [first-generation Nexus 7](/wiki/Nexus_7_\\(2012_version\\) \"Nexus 7 \\(2012\nversion\\)\") tablet, running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean\n\nDespite its success on smartphones, initially Android tablet adoption was\nslow.[335] One of the main causes was the [chicken or the\negg](/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg \"Chicken or the egg\") situation where consumers\nwere hesitant to buy an Android tablet due to a lack of high quality tablet\napplications, but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources\ndeveloping tablet applications until there was a significant market for\nthem.[336][337] The content and app \"ecosystem\" proved more important than\nhardware [specs](/wiki/Specification_\\(technical_standard\\) \"Specification\n\\(technical standard\\)\") as the selling point for tablets. Due to the lack of\nAndroid tablet-specific applications in 2011, early Android tablets had to\nmake do with existing smartphone applications that were ill-suited to larger\nscreen sizes, whereas the dominance of Apple's [iPad](/wiki/IPad \"IPad\") was\nreinforced by the large number of tablet-specific [iOS](/wiki/IOS \"IOS\")\napplications.[337][338]\n\nDespite app support in its infancy, a considerable number of Android tablets,\nlike the [Barnes & Noble Nook](/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble_Nook \"Barnes & Noble\nNook\") (alongside those using other operating systems, such as the [HP\nTouchPad](/wiki/HP_TouchPad \"HP TouchPad\") and [BlackBerry\nPlayBook](/wiki/BlackBerry_PlayBook \"BlackBerry PlayBook\")) were rushed out to\nmarket in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the iPad.[337]\n_InfoWorld_ has suggested that some Android manufacturers initially treated\ntheir first tablets as a \"Frankenphone business\", a short-term low-investment\nopportunity by placing a smartphone-optimized Android OS (before Android 3.0\n_Honeycomb_ for tablets was available) on a device while neglecting user\ninterface. This approach, such as with the [Dell Streak](/wiki/Dell_Streak\n\"Dell Streak\"), failed to gain market traction with consumers as well as\ndamaging the early reputation of Android tablets.[339][340] Furthermore,\nseveral Android tablets such as the [Motorola Xoom](/wiki/Motorola_Xoom\n\"Motorola Xoom\") were priced the same or higher than the [iPad](/wiki/IPad\n\"IPad\"), which hurt sales. An exception was the [Amazon](/wiki/Amazon.com\n\"Amazon.com\") [Kindle Fire](/wiki/Kindle_Fire \"Kindle Fire\"), which relied\nupon lower pricing as well as access to Amazon's ecosystem of applications and\ncontent.[337][341]\n\nThis began to change in 2012, with the release of the affordable [Nexus\n7](/wiki/Nexus_7_\\(2012_version\\) \"Nexus 7 \\(2012 version\\)\") and a push by\nGoogle for developers to write better tablet applications.[342] According to\nInternational Data Corporation, shipments of Android-powered tablets surpassed\niPads in Q3 2012.[343]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Nook_Color_Showing_Wikipedia_Index_On_Dolphin_Browser_HD.jpg/150px-\nNook_Color_Showing_Wikipedia_Index_On_Dolphin_Browser_HD.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nook_Color_Showing_Wikipedia_Index_On_Dolphin_Browser_HD.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nook_Color_Showing_Wikipedia_Index_On_Dolphin_Browser_HD.jpg\n\"St√¶kka\")\n\nBarnes & Noble [Nook](/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble_Nook \"Barnes & Noble Nook\")\nrunning Android\n\nAs of the end of 2013, over 191.6 million Android tablets had sold in three\nyears since 2011.[344][345] This made Android tablets the most-sold type of\ntablet in 2013, surpassing iPads in the second quarter of 2013.[346]\n\nAccording to StatCounter's web use statistics, as of August 15, 2017, Android\ntablets represent the majority of tablet devices used in [South\nAmerica](/wiki/South_America \"South America\") (57.46%)[347] and\n[Africa](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\") (69.08%),[348] while being a distant second to\niOS in North America (25.29%) and Europe (32.64%), despite having sizeable\nmajorities in many [Central American](/wiki/Central_America \"Central\nAmerica\"), [Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean \"Caribbean\"), and [Eastern\nEuropean](/wiki/Eastern_Europe \"Eastern Europe\") states.[349]) and\nrepresenting the majority in Asia (51.25%)[350] notably in India (65.98%)[351]\nand [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia \"Indonesia\") (82.18%).[352] Android is an\nextremely distant second at 11.93% in [Oceania](/wiki/Oceania \"Oceania\") as\nwell, mostly due to [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") (10.71%) and [New\nZealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\") (16.9%), while in some countries\nsuch as [Nauru](/wiki/Nauru \"Nauru\") over 80% of tablets are believed to use\nAndroid.[353] As well, Android is more often than not used by the minority of\nweb users in [Antarctica](/wiki/Antarctica \"Antarctica\"), which has no\npermanent population.[354]\n\nIn March 2016, Galen Gruman of _[InfoWorld](/wiki/InfoWorld \"InfoWorld\")_\nstated that Android devices could be a \"real part of your business [..]\nthere's no longer a reason to keep Android at arm's length.

Application piracy\n\nIn general, paid Android applications can easily be\n[pirated](/wiki/Copyright_infringement_of_software \"Copyright infringement of\nsoftware\").[359] In a May 2012 interview with [Eurogamer](/wiki/Eurogamer\n\"Eurogamer\"), the developers of _[Football Manager](/wiki/Football_Manager\n\"Football Manager\")_ stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate\nplayers was 9:1 for their game _Football Manager Handheld_.[360] However, not\nevery developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue; for example, in July\n2012 the developers of the game _[Wind-up Knight](/wiki/Wind-up_Knight \"Wind-\nup Knight\")_ said that piracy levels of their game were only 12%, and most of\nthe piracy came from China, where people cannot purchase apps from Google\nPlay.[361]\n\nIn 2010, Google released a tool for validating authorized purchases for use\nwithin apps, but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial\nto [crack](/wiki/Software_cracking \"Software cracking\"). Google responded that\nthe tool, especially its initial release, was intended as a sample framework\nfor developers to modify and build upon depending on their needs, not as a\nfinished piracy solution.[362] Android \"Jelly Bean\" introduced the ability for\npaid applications to be encrypted, so that they may work only on the device\nfor which they were purchased.[363][364]\n\n## Legal issues\n\nFurther information: [Oracle v. Google](/wiki/Oracle_v._Google \"Oracle v.\nGoogle\"), [Smartphone wars](/wiki/Smartphone_wars \"Smartphone wars\"), and\n[Patent troll](/wiki/Patent_troll \"Patent troll\")\n\nThe success of Android has made it a target for patent and copyright\nlitigation between technology companies, both Android and Android phone\nmanufacturers having been involved in numerous patent lawsuits. On August 12,\n2010, [Oracle](/wiki/Oracle_Corporation \"Oracle Corporation\") sued Google over\nclaimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the\n[Java](/wiki/Java_\\(programming_language\\) \"Java \\(programming language\\)\")\nprogramming language.[365] Oracle originally sought damages up to $6.1\nbillion,[366] but this valuation was rejected by a United States federal judge\nwho asked Oracle to revise the estimate.[367] In response, Google submitted\nmultiple lines of defense, counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on\nOracle's patents or copyright, that Oracle's patents were invalid, and several\nother defenses. They said that Android's Java runtime environment is based on\n[Apache Harmony](/wiki/Apache_Harmony \"Apache Harmony\"), a [clean\nroom](/wiki/Clean_room_design \"Clean room design\") implementation of the Java\nclass libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine called\n[Dalvik](/wiki/Dalvik_\\(software\\) \"Dalvik \\(software\\)\").[368] In May 2012,\nthe jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents,\nand the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google\nwas not copyrightable.[369][370] The parties agreed to zero dollars in\n[statutory damages](/wiki/Statutory_damages \"Statutory damages\") for a small\namount of copied code.[371] On May 9, 2014, the [Federal\nCircuit](/wiki/Federal_Circuit \"Federal Circuit\") partially reversed the\ndistrict court ruling, ruling in Oracle's favor on the copyrightability issue,\nand [remanding](/wiki/Remand_\\(court_procedure\\) \"Remand \\(court procedure\\)\")\nthe issue of [fair use](/wiki/Fair_use \"Fair use\") to the district\ncourt.[372][373]\n\nIn December 2015, Google announced that the next major release of Android\n([Android Nougat](/wiki/Android_Nougat \"Android Nougat\")) would switch to\n[OpenJDK](/wiki/OpenJDK \"OpenJDK\"), which is the official open-source\nimplementation of the Java platform, instead of using the now-discontinued\nApache Harmony project as its runtime. Code reflecting this change was also\nposted to the AOSP source repository.[181] In its announcement, Google claimed\nthis was part of an effort to create a \"common code base\" between Java on\nAndroid and other platforms.[182] Google later admitted in a court filing that\nthis was part of an effort to address the disputes with Oracle, as its use of\nOpenJDK code is governed under the [GNU General Public\nLicense](/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License \"GNU General Public License\") (GPL)\nwith a [linking exception](/wiki/GPL_linking_exception \"GPL linking\nexception\"), and that \"any damages claim associated with the new versions\nexpressly licensed by Oracle under OpenJDK would require a separate analysis\nof damages from earlier releases\".[181] In June 2016, a United States federal\ncourt ruled in favor of Google, stating that its use of the APIs was fair\nuse.[374]\n\nIn addition to lawsuits against Google directly, various [proxy\nwars](/wiki/Proxy_war \"Proxy war\") have been waged against Android indirectly\nby targeting manufacturers of Android devices, with the effect of discouraging\nmanufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing\nan Android device to market.[375] Both [Apple](/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\")\nand Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement, with\nApple's ongoing [legal action against\nSamsung](/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.,_Ltd. \"Apple Inc. v.\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\") being a particularly high-profile case. In\nJanuary 2012, Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with\neleven Android device manufacturers, whose products account for \"70 percent of\nall Android smartphones\" sold in the US[376] and 55% of the worldwide revenue\nfor Android devices.[377] These include [Samsung](/wiki/Samsung \"Samsung\") and\n[HTC](/wiki/HTC \"HTC\").[378] Samsung's patent settlement with Microsoft\nincluded an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing\nphones running Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system.[375] Microsoft has\nalso [tied](/wiki/Tying_\\(commerce\\) \"Tying \\(commerce\\)\") its own Android\nsoftware to patent licenses, requiring the bundling of [Microsoft Office\nMobile](/wiki/Microsoft_Office_Mobile \"Microsoft Office Mobile\") and\n[Skype](/wiki/Skype \"Skype\") applications on Android devices to subsidize the\nlicensing fees, while at the same time helping to promote its software\nlines.[379][380]\n\nGoogle has publicly expressed its frustration for the current patent landscape\nin the United States, accusing Apple, Oracle and Microsoft of trying to take\ndown Android through patent litigation, rather than innovating and competing\nwith better products and services.[381] In August 2011, Google purchased\n[Motorola Mobility](/wiki/Motorola_Mobility \"Motorola Mobility\") for US$12.5\nbillion, which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect Android,\nsince Motorola Mobility held more than 17,000 patents.[382][383] In December\n2011, Google bought over a thousand patents from [IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\").[384]\n\nIn 2013, [FairSearch](/wiki/FairSearch \"FairSearch\"), a lobbying organization\nsupported by Microsoft, Oracle and others, filed a complaint regarding Android\nwith the [European Commission](/wiki/European_Commission \"European\nCommission\"), alleging that its free-of-charge distribution model constituted\nanti-competitive [predatory pricing](/wiki/Predatory_pricing \"Predatory\npricing\"). The [Free Software Foundation\nEurope](/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation_Europe \"Free Software Foundation\nEurope\"), whose donors include Google, disputed the Fairsearch\nallegations.[385] On April 20, 2016, the EU filed a formal antitrust complaint\nagainst Google based upon the FairSearch allegations, arguing that its\nleverage over Android vendors, including the mandatory bundling of the entire\nsuite of proprietary Google software, hindering the ability for competing\nsearch providers to be integrated into Android, and barring vendors from\nproducing devices running forks of Android, constituted anti-competitive\npractices.[386] In August 2016, Google was fined US$6.75 million by the\nRussian [Federal Antimonopoly Service](/wiki/Federal_Antimonopoly_Service\n\"Federal Antimonopoly Service\") (FAS) under similar allegations by\n[Yandex](/wiki/Yandex \"Yandex\").[387]\n\n## Other

In December 2014, one reviewer commented\nthat Android's notification system is \"vastly more complete and robust than in\nmost environments\" and that Android is \"absolutely usable\" as one's primary\ndesktop operating system.[431]\n\nIn October 2015, _[The Wall Street Journal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal \"The\nWall Street Journal\")_ reported that Android will serve as Google's future\nmain laptop operating system, with the plan to fold Chrome OS into it by\n2017.[432][433] Google's Sundar Pichai, who led the development of Android,\nexplained that \"mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend\nwith what we think of as desktop today.\"[432] Also, back in 2009, Google co-\nfounder Sergey Brin himself said that Chrome OS and Android would \"likely\nconverge over time.\"[434] Lockheimer, who replaced Pichai as head of Android\nand Chrome OS, responded to this claim with an official Google blog post\nstating that \"While we've been working on ways to bring together the best of\nboth operating systems, there's no plan to phase out Chrome OS [which has]\nguaranteed auto-updates for five years\".[435] That is unlike Android where\nsupport is shorter with \"[EOL](/wiki/End-of-life_\\(product\\) \"End-of-life\n\\(product\\)\") dates [being..] at least 3 years [into the future] for Android\ntablets for education\".[436]\n\nAt [Google I/O](/wiki/Google_I/O \"Google I/O\") in May 2016, Google announced\nDaydream, a [virtual reality](/wiki/Virtual_reality \"Virtual reality\")\nplatform that relies on a smartphone and provides VR capabilities through a\n[virtual reality headset](/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset \"Virtual reality\nheadset\") and controller designed by Google itself.[396] The platform is built\ninto Android starting with [Android Nougat](/wiki/Android_Nougat \"Android\nNougat\"), differentiating from standalone support for VR capabilities.

Although it has no\nofficial name, the Android team at Google reportedly call it \"Bugdroid\".[437]\nDue to Android's high popularity in the 2010s, it has become one of the most\nrecognizable icons in the technology world.\n\nIt was designed by then-Google graphic designer [Irina Blok](/wiki/Irina_Blok\n\"Irina Blok\") on November 5, 2007 when Android was announced. Contrary to\nreports that she was tasked with a project to create an icon,[438] Blok\nconfirmed in an interview that she independently developed it and made it\n[open source](/wiki/Open_source \"Open source\"). The robot design was initially\nnot presented to Google, but it quickly became commonplace in the Android\ndevelopment team, with various different variations of it created by the\ndevelopers there who liked the figure, as it was free under a [Creative\nCommons](/wiki/Creative_Commons \"Creative Commons\") license.[439][440] Its\npopularity amongst the development team eventually led to Google adopting it\nas an official icon as part of the Android logo when it launched to consumers\nin 2008.\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Comparison of mobile operating systems](/wiki/Comparison_of_mobile_operating_systems \"Comparison of mobile operating systems\")\n  * [Index of Android OS articles](/wiki/Index_of_Android_OS_articles \"Index of Android OS articles\")\n\n  * [![Abc.xyz Favicon.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Abc.xyz_Favicon.png/21px-Abc.xyz_Favicon.png)](/wiki/File:Abc.xyz_Favicon.png)[Alphabet portal](/wiki/Portal:Alphabet \"Portal:Alphabet\")\n  * [![Free and open-source software logo \\(2009\\).svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Free_and_open-source_software_logo_%282009%29.svg/21px-Free_and_open-source_software_logo_%282009%29.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Free_and_open-source_software_logo_\\(2009\\).svg)[Free software portal](/wiki/Portal:Free_software \"Portal:Free software\")\n  * [![Google 2015 logo.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Google_2015_logo.svg/24px-Google_2015_logo.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Google_2015_logo.svg)[Google portal](/wiki/Portal:Google \"Portal:Google\")\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** To put the Statistica's numbers in context: by Strategy Analytics estimates, [Windows](/wiki/Windows \"Windows\") the most popular \"desktop\" operating system, has an estimated installed base of about 1.3 billion at best;[318] they also estimate the overall tablet installed base to be already of comparable size to the PC market and predict tablets will have surpassed them by 2018.\n  2. **Jump up ^** Versions accounting for less than 0.1% are not included.\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Android Language Breakdown\"](https://www.openhub.net/p/android/analyses/latest/languages_summary).
