Under [common\nlaw](/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\"), the Crown is inherited by a sovereign's\nchildren or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral line. The [Bill of\nRights 1689](/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689 \"Bill of Rights 1689\") and the [Act of\nSettlement 1701](/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701 \"Act of Settlement 1701\"),\nrestrict succession to the [throne](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\") to the legitimate\nProtestant descendants of [Sophia of Hanover](/wiki/Sophia_of_Hanover \"Sophia\nof Hanover\") that are in \"[communion](/wiki/Communion_\\(Christian\\) \"Communion\n\\(Christian\\)\") with the [Church of England](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church\nof England\")\".[1] Spouses of [Roman Catholics](/wiki/Roman_Catholics \"Roman\nCatholics\") were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015.\nProtestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are\neligible.[2]\n\nQueen [Elizabeth II](/wiki/Elizabeth_II \"Elizabeth II\") is the sovereign, and\nher [heir apparent](/wiki/Heir_apparent \"Heir apparent\") is her eldest son,\n[Charles, Prince of Wales](/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales \"Charles, Prince of\nWales\"). Next in line after him is [Prince William, Duke of\nCambridge](/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge \"Prince William, Duke of\nCambridge\"), the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is [Prince\nGeorge](/wiki/Prince_George_of_Cambridge \"Prince George of Cambridge\"), the\nson of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, [Princess\nCharlotte](/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Cambridge \"Princess Charlotte of\nCambridge\"). Fifth in line is [Prince Henry of\nWales](/wiki/Prince_Henry_of_Wales \"Prince Henry of Wales\"), the younger son\nof the Prince of Wales. Sixth in line is [Prince Andrew, Duke of\nYork](/wiki/Prince_Andrew,_Duke_of_York \"Prince Andrew, Duke of York\"), the\nQueen's second-eldest son. Any of the first six in line marrying without the\nsovereign's consent would be disqualified from succession.\n\nThe first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the\nsovereign's consort, may be appointed [Counsellors of\nState](/wiki/Counsellor_of_State \"Counsellor of State\"). Counsellors of State\nperform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while he or she\nis out of the country or temporarily incapacitated.

Originally in both countries, there were no\nfixed rules governing succession to the throne. The individual could have\nrelied on inheritance, statute, election (by\n[Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain \"Parliament of Great Britain\")\nor by another body), nomination (by a reigning sovereign in his or her\n[will](/wiki/Will_\\(law\\) \"Will \\(law\\)\")), conquest or prescription (_de\nfacto_ possession of the Crown). It was often unclear which of these bases\nshould take precedence; often, the outcome depended not on the legal strength\nof the claims, but on the political or military power of the claimants.\n\nHowever, over time, the default rule became male primogeniture: later monarchs\ncoming to the throne by exception to this rule went to great lengths to\nexplain and justify going against these rules, and to prove their rivals\nillegitimate. Eventually, Parliament asserted control of succession.\n\n### England\n\nIn 1485, Henry Tudor, a female-line descendant of a legitimated branch of the\n[royal house](/wiki/Royal_house \"Royal house\") of\n[Lancaster](/wiki/House_of_Lancaster \"House of Lancaster\"), the [House of\nBeaufort](/wiki/House_of_Beaufort \"House of Beaufort\"), assumed the English\ncrown as [Henry VII](/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England \"Henry VII of England\"), after\ndefeating [Richard III](/wiki/Richard_III_of_England \"Richard III of\nEngland\"), who was killed at the [battle of\nBosworth](/wiki/Battle_of_Bosworth_Field \"Battle of Bosworth Field\") when\nleading a charge against Henry's standard. Richard was the last king of the\n[House of York](/wiki/House_of_York \"House of York\"), and the last of the\n[Plantagenet dynasty](/wiki/House_of_Plantagenet \"House of Plantagenet\").\nHenry declared himself king retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before\nhis victory over Richard at Bosworth Field,[6] and caused Richard's _[Titulus\nRegius](/wiki/Titulus_Regius \"Titulus Regius\")_ to be repealed and expunged\nfrom the [Rolls of Parliament](/wiki/Rolls_of_Parliament \"Rolls of\nParliament\").[7] After Henry's coronation in London in October that year, his\nfirst parliament, summoned to meet at Westminster in November, enacted that\n\"the inheritance of the crown should be, rest, remain and abide in the most\nroyal person of the then sovereign lord, King Henry VII, and the heirs of his\nbody lawfully coming.\"[8]\n\nHenry VII was followed by his son, [Henry VIII](/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England\n\"Henry VIII of England\"). Though his father descended from the Lancastrians,\nHenry VIII could also claim the throne through the Yorkist line, as his mother\n[Elizabeth](/wiki/Elizabeth_of_York \"Elizabeth of York\") was the sister and\nheiress of [Edward V](/wiki/Edward_V_of_England \"Edward V of England\"). In\n1542 Henry also assumed the title [King of Ireland](/wiki/King_of_Ireland\n\"King of Ireland\"); this would pass down with the monarchs of England, and\nlater Great Britain, until the [Acts of Union 1800](/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1800\n\"Acts of Union 1800\") merged the separate crowns into that of the United\nKingdom.\n\nHenry VIII's numerous marriages led to several complications over succession.\nHenry VIII was first married to [Catherine of\nAragon](/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon \"Catherine of Aragon\"), by whom he had a\ndaughter named [Mary](/wiki/Mary_I_of_England \"Mary I of England\"). His second\nmarriage, to [Anne Boleyn](/wiki/Anne_Boleyn \"Anne Boleyn\"), resulted in a\ndaughter named [Elizabeth](/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England \"Elizabeth I of\nEngland\"). Henry VIII had a son, [Edward](/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England \"Edward\nVI of England\"), by his third wife, [Jane Seymour](/wiki/Jane_Seymour \"Jane\nSeymour\"). An Act of Parliament passed in 1533 declared Mary illegitimate;\nanother passed in 1536 did the same for Elizabeth. Though the two remained\nillegitimate, an Act of Parliament passed in 1544 allowed reinserting them,\nproviding further \"that the King should and might give, will, limit, assign,\nappoint or dispose the said imperial Crown and the other premises … by\n[letters patent](/wiki/Letters_patent \"Letters patent\") or last will in\nwriting.\" Mary and Elizabeth, under [Henry VIII's\nwill](/wiki/Will_of_Henry_VIII_of_England \"Will of Henry VIII of England\"),\nwere to be followed by descendants of the King's deceased sister [Mary Tudor,\nDuchess of Suffolk](/wiki/Mary_Tudor,_Queen_of_France \"Mary Tudor, Queen of\nFrance\") (he however excluded his niece [Frances Brandon, Duchess of\nSuffolk](/wiki/Frances_Grey,_Duchess_of_Suffolk \"Frances Grey, Duchess of\nSuffolk\")). This will also excluded from the succession the descendants of\nHenry's eldest sister [Margaret Tudor](/wiki/Margaret_Tudor \"Margaret Tudor\"),\nwho were the rulers of [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Elizabeth_I_in_Parliament.jpg/170px-\nElizabeth_I_in_Parliament.jpg)](/wiki/File:Elizabeth_I_in_Parliament.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Elizabeth_I_in_Parliament.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nQueen Elizabeth I enthroned in Parliament\n\nWhen Henry VIII died in 1547, the young Edward succeeded him, becoming Edward\nVI. Edward VI was the first Protestant Sovereign to succeed to the rule of\nEngland. He attempted to divert the course of succession in his will to\nprevent his Catholic half-sister, Mary, from inheriting the throne. He\nexcluded Mary and Elizabeth, settling on the Duchess of Suffolk's daughter,\n[Lady Jane Grey](/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey \"Lady Jane Grey\"). Jane was also\noriginally excluded on the premise that no woman could reign over England.\nNonetheless, the will, which originally referred to Jane's heirs-male, was\namended to refer to Jane _and_ her heirs-male. Upon Edward VI's death in 1553,\nJane was proclaimed Queen of England and Ireland. She was not universally\nrecognised and after nine days she was overthrown by the popular Mary. As\nHenry VIII's will had been approved by an Act of Parliament in 1544, Edward's\ncontravening will was unlawful and ignored.\n\nMary was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth, who broke with the\nprecedents of many of her predecessors, and refused to name an heir. Whilst\nprevious monarchs (including Henry VIII) had specifically been granted\nauthority to settle uncertain successions in their wills, the [Treasons Act\n1571](/wiki/Treasons_Act_1571 \"Treasons Act 1571\") asserted that Parliament\nhad the right to settle disputes, and made it treason to deny Parliamentary\nauthority. Wary of threats from other possible heirs, Parliament further\npassed the Act of Association 1584, which provided that any individual\ninvolved in attempts to murder the Sovereign would be disqualified from\nsucceeding. (The Act was repealed in 1863.)\n\n### Scotland\n\nThe [House of Stewart](/wiki/House_of_Stuart \"House of Stuart\") (later Stuart)\nhad ruled in Scotland since 1371. It had followed strict rules of\nprimogeniture until the deposition and exile of [Mary\nI](/wiki/Mary,_Queen_of_Scots \"Mary, Queen of Scots\") in 1567; even then she\nwas succeeded by her son, [James VI](/wiki/James_VI_and_I \"James VI and I\").\n\n### After the union of the crowns\n\n#### Stuarts\n\nElizabeth I of England and Ireland was succeeded by King [James VI of\nScotland](/wiki/James_VI_and_I \"James VI and I\"), her first cousin twice\nremoved, even though his succession violated Henry VIII's will, under which\n[Lady Anne Stanley](/wiki/Anne_Stanley,_Countess_of_Castlehaven \"Anne Stanley,\nCountess of Castlehaven\"), heiress of Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk, was\nsupposed to succeed. James asserted that hereditary right was superior to\nstatutory provision, and as King of Scotland was powerful enough to deter any\nrival. He reigned as James I of England and Ireland, thus effecting the [Union\nof the Crowns](/wiki/Union_of_the_Crowns \"Union of the Crowns\"), although\nEngland and Scotland remained separate sovereign states until 1707. His\nsuccession was rapidly ratified by Parliament.[9]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6e/House_of_Stuart.png/850px-\nHouse_of_Stuart.png)](/wiki/File:House_of_Stuart.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:House_of_Stuart.png \"File:House of Stuart.png\")\n\ncenter\n\nJames's eldest surviving son and successor, [Charles\nI](/wiki/Charles_I_of_England \"Charles I of England\"), was overthrown and\nbeheaded in 1649. The monarchy itself was abolished. A few years later, it was\nreplaced by the Protectorate under [Oliver Cromwell](/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell\n\"Oliver Cromwell\"), effectively a monarch with the title of [Lord\nProtector](/wiki/Lord_Protector \"Lord Protector\") rather than King. Cromwell\nhad the right to name his own successor, which he exercised on his deathbed by\nchoosing his son, [Richard Cromwell](/wiki/Richard_Cromwell \"Richard\nCromwell\"). Richard was ineffective, and was quickly forced from office.\nShortly afterwards, the monarchy was restored, with Charles I's son [Charles\nII](/wiki/Charles_II_of_England \"Charles II of England\") as King.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Anniex.jpg/170px-\nAnniex.jpg)](/wiki/File:Anniex.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Anniex.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAfter the death of her last child in 1700, [Princess\nAnne](/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain \"Anne, Queen of Great Britain\")\nbecame the last individual left in the line of succession determined by the\nBill of Rights.\n\n[James II and VII](/wiki/James_II_of_England \"James II of England\"), a Roman\nCatholic, followed his brother Charles II, despite efforts in the late 1670s\nto [exclude](/wiki/Exclusion_Crisis \"Exclusion Crisis\") him in favour of\nCharles's illegitimate Protestant son, the [Duke of\nMonmouth](/wiki/James_Scott,_1st_Duke_of_Monmouth \"James Scott, 1st Duke of\nMonmouth\"). James was deposed when his Protestant opponents forced him to flee\nfrom England in 1688. Parliament then deemed that James had, by fleeing the\nrealms, abdicated the thrones and offered the Crowns not to the King's infant\nson [James](/wiki/James_Francis_Edward_Stuart \"James Francis Edward Stuart\")\nbut to his Protestant daughter [Mary](/wiki/Mary_II_of_England \"Mary II of\nEngland\") and to her husband [William](/wiki/William_III_of_England \"William\nIII of England\"), who as James's nephew was the first person in the succession\nnot descended from him. The two became joint Sovereigns (a unique circumstance\nin British history) as William III of England and Ireland (and II of Scotland)\nand Mary II of England, Scotland and Ireland. William had insisted on this\nunique provision as a condition of his military leadership against James.\n\nThe English [Bill of Rights](/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689 \"Bill of Rights 1689\")\npassed in 1689 determined succession to the English, Scottish and Irish\nThrones. First in the line were the descendants of Mary II. Next came Mary's\nsister [Princess Anne](/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain \"Anne, Queen of\nGreat Britain\") and her descendants. Finally, the descendants of William by\nany future marriage were added to the line of succession. Only Protestants\nwere allowed to succeed to the Thrones, and those who married Roman Catholics\nwere excluded.\n\nAfter Mary II died in 1694, her husband continued to reign alone until his own\ndeath in 1702. The line of succession provided for by the Bill of Rights was\nalmost at an end; William and Mary never had any children, and Princess Anne's\nchildren had all died. Therefore, Parliament passed the [Act of\nSettlement](/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701 \"Act of Settlement 1701\"). The Act\nmaintained the provision of the Bill of Rights whereby William would be\nsucceeded by Princess Anne and her descendants, and thereafter by his own\ndescendants from future marriages. The Act, however, declared that they would\nbe followed by James I & VI's granddaughter [Sophia](/wiki/Sophia_of_Hanover\n\"Sophia of Hanover\"), Electress Dowager of Hanover (the daughter of James's\ndaughter [Elizabeth Stuart](/wiki/Elizabeth_Stuart,_Queen_of_Bohemia\n\"Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia\")), and her heirs.

The Act provided that, upon the death of Anne, the Estates would\nmeet to select an heir to the throne of Scotland, who could not be the same\nperson as the English Sovereign unless numerous political and economic\nconditions were met. Anne originally withheld the [Royal\nAssent](/wiki/Royal_Assent \"Royal Assent\"), but was forced to grant it when\nthe Estates refused to raise taxes and sought to withdraw troops from the\nQueen's army. England's Parliament responded by passing the [Alien Act\n1705](/wiki/Alien_Act_1705 \"Alien Act 1705\"), which threatened to cripple\nScotland's economy by cutting off trade with them. Thus, Scotland had little\nchoice but to unite with England to form the [Kingdom of Great\nBritain](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great Britain\") in 1707;\nthe Crown of the new nation (along with the Crown of Ireland) was subject to\nthe rules laid down by the English Act of Settlement.\n\n#### Hanoverians and Windsors\n\n[![Title page, which is crowded with fonts of varying sizes and shapes, reads\n\"The Protestant Tutor, Instructing YOUTH, and Others, In the Compleat Method\nof Spelling, Reading, and Writing True English; Also, Discovering to them the\nNotorious ERRORS, Damnable DOCTRINES, and Cruel MASSACRES, of the Bloddy\nPapists; Which England may Expect from a Popish Successor.

Edward VIII had desired to marry [Wallis\nSimpson](/wiki/Wallis_Simpson \"Wallis Simpson\"), a divorcee, but the [Church\nof England](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of England\"), of which the British\nSovereign is Supreme Governor, would not authorize the marriage of divorcees.\nConsequently, Parliament passed [His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act\n1936](/wiki/His_Majesty%27s_Declaration_of_Abdication_Act_1936 \"His Majesty's\nDeclaration of Abdication Act 1936\"), by which Edward VIII ceased to be\nSovereign \"immediately upon\" his royal assent as King being signified in\nParliament on 11 December. The Act provided that he and his descendants, if\nany, were not to have any \"right, title or interest in or to the succession to\nthe Throne\".

In February 1952, on her accession, Elizabeth II [was\nproclaimed](/wiki/Proclamation_of_accession_of_Elizabeth_II \"Proclamation of\naccession of Elizabeth II\") as sovereign separately throughout her realms. In\nOctober 2011, the heads of government of all 16 realms agreed unanimously at a\n[meeting](/wiki/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_Meeting_2011 \"Commonwealth\nHeads of Government Meeting 2011\") held in Perth, Australia, to proposed\nchanges to the royal succession laws that would see the order of succession\nfor people born after 28 October 2011 governed by absolute\nprimogeniture—wherein succession passes to an individual's children according\nto birth order, regardless of gender—instead of male-preference primogeniture.\nThey also agreed to lift a ban on those who marry Roman Catholics. The ban on\nCatholics themselves was retained to ensure that the monarch would be in\ncommunion with the [Church of England](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of\nEngland\").[11] The changes came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on\n26 March 2015, after legislation was made according to each realm's\nconstitution.[12][13]\n\nFollowing the changes coming into effect, the positions of the first 27 in\nline remained unchanged, including Princess Anne and her children and\ngrandchildren, until the birth of Princess Charlotte of Cambridge on 2 May\n2015. The first to be affected by the changes, on the day they came into\neffect in March, were the children of Lady Davina Lewis—her son Tāne (born\n2012) and her daughter Senna (born 2010)—who were reversed in the order of\nsuccession, becoming 29th and 28th in line respectively.[14]\n\n## Current rules\n\nThe Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement (restated by the Acts of Union)\nstill govern succession to the throne. They were amended in the United Kingdom\nby the [Succession to the Crown Act\n2013](/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_2013 \"Succession to the Crown Act\n2013\"), which was passed mainly \"to make succession to the Crown not depend on\ngender\" and \"to make provision about Royal Marriages\" (according to its [long\ntitle](/wiki/Long_title \"Long title\")), thereby implementing the [Perth\nAgreement](/wiki/Perth_Agreement \"Perth Agreement\") in the UK and in those\nrealms that, by their laws, have as their monarch automatically whoever is\nmonarch of the UK. Other realms passed their own legislation.\n\nAnyone ineligible to succeed is treated as if they were \"dead\". That\nindividual's descendants are not also disqualified, unless they are personally\nineligible.\n\n### Marriages\n\nThe [Act of Settlement 1701](/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701 \"Act of Settlement\n1701\") provides that Protestant \"[heirs of the body](/wiki/Heirs_of_the_body\n\"Heirs of the body\")\" (that is, legitimate descendants) of [Sophia, Electress\nof Hanover](/wiki/Sophia,_Electress_of_Hanover \"Sophia, Electress of\nHanover\"), are eligible to succeed to the throne, unless otherwise\ndisqualified. The meaning of _heir of the body_ is determined by the common\nlaw rules of male preference [primogeniture](/wiki/Primogeniture\n\"Primogeniture\") (the \"male-preference\" criterion is no longer applicable, in\nrespect of succession to the throne, to persons born after 28 October 2011),\nwhereby older children and their descendants inherit before younger children,\nand a male child takes precedence over a female sibling.[15] Children born out\nof wedlock and adopted children are not eligible to succeed. Illegitimate\nchildren whose parents subsequently marry are legitimated, but remain\nineligible to inherit the Crown.[n 4]\n\nThe [Royal Marriages Act 1772](/wiki/Royal_Marriages_Act_1772 \"Royal Marriages\nAct 1772\") (repealed by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013) further required\ndescendants of [George II](/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain \"George II of\nGreat Britain\") to obtain the consent of the reigning monarch to marry. (The\nrequirement did not apply to descendants of princesses who married into\nforeign families, as well as, from 1936, any descendants of Edward VIII,[n 5]\nof which there are none.) The Act provided, however, that if a\n[dynast](/wiki/Dynasty#Dynasts \"Dynasty\") older than twenty-five years\nnotified the Privy Council of his or her intention to marry without the\nconsent of the Sovereign, then he or she may have lawfully done so after one\nyear, unless both houses of Parliament expressly disapproved of the marriage.\nA marriage that contravened the Royal Marriages Act was void, and the\nresulting offspring illegitimate and thus ineligible to succeed, though the\nsuccession of the dynast who failed to obtain consent was not itself affected.\nThis also had the consequence that marriage to a Roman Catholic without\npermission was void, so that the dynast was not disqualified from succeeding\non account of being married to a Roman Catholic. Thus when the future [George\nIV](/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom \"George IV of the United Kingdom\")\nattempted to marry the Roman Catholic [Maria\nFitzherbert](/wiki/Maria_Anne_Fitzherbert \"Maria Anne Fitzherbert\") in 1785\nwithout obtaining permission from [George\nIII](/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom \"George III of the United\nKingdom\") he did not disqualify himself from inheriting the throne in due\ncourse.[2] A marriage voided by the 1772 act prior to its repeal remains void\n\"for all purposes relating to the succession to the Crown\" under the 2013\nact.[16]\n\nThe constitutional crisis arising from Edward VIII's decision to marry a\ndivorcee in 1936 led to [His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act\n1936](/wiki/His_Majesty%27s_Declaration_of_Abdication_Act_1936 \"His Majesty's\nDeclaration of Abdication Act 1936\"), which provided that Edward VIII and his\ndescendants would have no claim to the throne.[17] The Act is no longer\napplicable, because Edward died in 1972 without issue.\n\nUnder the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act, the first six persons in line to\nthe throne must obtain the sovereign's approval before marrying.[16] Marriage\nwithout the Sovereign's consent disqualifies the person and the person's\ndescendants from the marriage from succeeding to the Crown,[16] but the\nmarriage is still legally valid.\n\n### Religion\n\nRules relating to eligibility established by the Bill of Rights are retained\nunder the Act of Settlement. The preamble to the Act of Settlement notes that\nthe Bill of Rights provides \"that all and every person and persons that then\n[at the time of the Bill of Right's passage] were, or afterwards should be\nreconciled to, or shall hold communion with the [See or Church of\nRome](/wiki/Holy_See \"Holy See\"), or should profess the popish religion, or\nmarry a papist, should be excluded.\"[18] The Act of Settlement continues,\nproviding \"that all and every Person and Persons who shall … is, are or shall\nbe reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the See or Church of Rome or\nshall profess the Popish religion or shall marry a papist shall be subject to\nsuch Incapacities\"[19] as the Bill of Rights established.\n\nThe precise meaning of the aforementioned clauses is subject to contention.\nUnder one interpretation, the religion of an individual at the precise moment\nof succession is relevant. Under another interpretation, anyone who has been a\nRoman Catholic at any time since 1689 (\"then … or afterwards\") is forever\nineligible to succeed. The former interpretation allows a Roman Catholic to\nconvert to Protestantism and succeed to the Throne just before a vacancy on\nthe throne occurs devolving the crown on the first dynast in the line of\nsuccession; the latter does not. In either case, however, other denominations\nof faith are not affected; it is clear that any non-Catholic may convert to\nProtestantism and succeed to the Throne. It is a requirement that the monarch\nmust be a Protestant.[1]\n\nThe Act of Settlement further provided that anyone who married a Roman\nCatholic was ineligible to succeed. The Act did not require that the spouse be\nProtestant; it only barred those who marry Roman Catholics. Since the passage\nof the Act it has been determined (in the case of [Prince Edward, Duke of\nKent](/wiki/Prince_Edward,_Duke_of_Kent \"Prince Edward, Duke of Kent\")) that\nan individual is not barred because his or her spouse later converts to Roman\nCatholicism after their marriage. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 removed\nthe bar on individuals married to Roman Catholics, though not on Roman\nCatholics themselves.\n\n### Treason\n\nUnder the [Treason Act 1702](/wiki/Treason_Act_1702 \"Treason Act 1702\") and\nthe Treason (Ireland) Act 1703, it is\n[treason](/wiki/High_treason_in_the_United_Kingdom \"High treason in the United\nKingdom\") to \"endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next\nin succession to the crown ... from succeeding ... to the imperial crown of\nthis realm\".

The\nanniversary is observed throughout the sovereign's reign as [Accession\nDay](/wiki/Accession_Day \"Accession Day\"), including royal [gun\nsalutes](/wiki/Gun_salutes \"Gun salutes\") in the United Kingdom.[22]\n\nFormerly, a new sovereign proclaimed his or her own accession. But on the\ndeath of Elizabeth I an Accession Council met to proclaim the accession of\nJames I to the throne of England. James was then in Scotland and reigning as\nKing James VI of Scotland. This precedent has been followed since. Now, the\nAccession Council normally meets in [St James's\nPalace](/wiki/St_James%27s_Palace \"St James's Palace\"). Proclamations since\nJames I's have usually been made in the name of the [Lords\nSpiritual](/wiki/Lords_Spiritual \"Lords Spiritual\") and\n[Temporal](/wiki/Lords_Temporal \"Lords Temporal\"), the [Privy\nCouncil](/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Privy Council of the\nUnited Kingdom\"), the [Lord Mayor](/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_the_City_of_London\n\"Lord Mayor of the City of London\"), [Aldermen](/wiki/Alderman \"Alderman\") and\ncitizens of the [City of London](/wiki/City_of_London \"City of London\") and\n\"other principal [Gentlemen](/wiki/Gentleman \"Gentleman\") of quality\", though\nthere have been variations in some proclamations. The proclamation of\naccession of Elizabeth II was the first to make mention of representatives of\nmembers of the [Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations \"Commonwealth of\nNations\").\n\nUpon his or her accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and\nsubscribe several oaths. The Bill of Rights of 1689 first required the\nsovereign to make a public declaration of non-belief in Roman Catholicism.[n\n7] This declaration, known as the [Accession\nDeclaration](/wiki/Accession_Declaration \"Accession Declaration\"), is required\nto be taken at either the first meeting of parliament of his or her reign\n(i.e. during the [State Opening of\nParliament](/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament \"State Opening of Parliament\"))\nor at his or her coronation, whichever occurs first. The current wording of\nthis declaration was adopted in 1910 as the previous wording was deemed to be\ncontroversial and overtly anti-Catholic. Rather than denouncing Roman\nCatholicism, the sovereign now declares him or herself to be a Protestant and\nthat he or she will \"uphold and maintain\" the Protestant succession.[23] In\naddition to the Accession Declaration, the new sovereign is required by the\nActs of Union 1707 to make an oath to \"maintain and preserve\" the Church of\nScotland.[24] This oath is normally made at the sovereign's first meeting of\nthe Privy Council following his or her accession. According to the [Regency\nAct 1937](/wiki/Regency_Act_1937 \"Regency Act 1937\"), should the sovereign be\nunder the age of 18, such oaths and declarations required to be taken by the\nsovereign shall be made upon his attainment of that age.[25]\n\nAfter a period of mourning,[26] the new sovereign is usually [consecrated and\ncrowned](/wiki/Coronation_of_the_British_monarch \"Coronation of the British\nmonarch\") in [Westminster Abbey](/wiki/Westminster_Abbey \"Westminster Abbey\").\nNormally, the [Archbishop of Canterbury](/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury\n\"Archbishop of Canterbury\") officiates, though the sovereign may designate any\nother bishop of the [Church of England](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of\nEngland\"). A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for\nexample, [Edward VIII](/wiki/Edward_VIII \"Edward VIII\") was never crowned, yet\nduring his short reign was the undoubted king.\n\n## See also\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png)[Biography portal](/wiki/Portal:Biography \"Portal:Biography\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Crown_of_Saint_Edward.svg/32px-Crown_of_Saint_Edward.svg.png)[Royalty portal](/wiki/Portal:Royalty \"Portal:Royalty\")\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png)[United Kingdom portal](/wiki/Portal:United_Kingdom \"Portal:United Kingdom\")\n\n  * [Accession Declaration Act 1910](/wiki/Accession_Declaration_Act_1910 \"Accession Declaration Act 1910\")\n  * [Alternative successions of the English crown](/wiki/Alternative_successions_of_the_English_crown \"Alternative successions of the English crown\")\n  * [British prince](/wiki/British_prince \"British prince\")\n  * [British princess](/wiki/British_princess \"British princess\")\n  * [Family tree of the British royal family](/wiki/Family_tree_of_the_British_royal_family \"Family tree of the British royal family\")\n  * [Jacobite succession](/wiki/Jacobite_succession \"Jacobite succession\")\n  * [List of descendants of George V](/wiki/List_of_descendants_of_George_V \"List of descendants of George V\")\n  * [List of heirs to the British throne](/wiki/List_of_heirs_to_the_British_throne \"List of heirs to the British throne\")\n  * [List of heirs to the English throne](/wiki/List_of_heirs_to_the_English_throne \"List of heirs to the English throne\")\n  * [List of heirs of Scotland](/wiki/List_of_heirs_of_Scotland \"List of heirs of Scotland\")\n  * [List of monarchs in the British Isles](/wiki/List_of_monarchs_in_the_British_Isles \"List of monarchs in the British Isles\")\n  * [Patrilineal descent of Elizabeth II](/wiki/Patrilineal_descent_of_Elizabeth_II \"Patrilineal descent of Elizabeth II\")\n  * [Posthumous birth](/wiki/Posthumous_birth \"Posthumous birth\")\n  * [Royal Succession Act 2013](/wiki/Royal_Succession_Act_2013 \"Royal Succession Act 2013\") (New Zealand)\n  * [Royal Succession Bills and Acts](/wiki/Royal_Succession_Bills_and_Acts \"Royal Succession Bills and Acts\")\n  * [Succession to the Crown Act 2013](/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_2013 \"Succession to the Crown Act 2013\") (United Kingdom)\n  * [Succession to the Crown Act 2015](/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_2015 \"Succession to the Crown Act 2015\") (Australia)\n  * [Succession to the Throne Act, 2013](/wiki/Succession_to_the_Throne_Act,_2013 \"Succession to the Throne Act, 2013\") (Canada)\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Open_book_nae_02.svg/16px-Open_book_nae_02.svg.png) _[Perth Agreement 2011 and other articles, linked directly or indirectly](/wiki/Book:Perth_Agreement_2011_and_other_articles,_linked_directly_or_indirectly \"Book:Perth Agreement 2011 and other articles, linked directly or indirectly\")_ – [Wikipedia book](/wiki/Wikipedia:Books \"Wikipedia:Books\")\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Succession to the Crown Act 2013, s. 3: \"A person who (when the person marries) is one of the 6 persons next in the line of succession to the Crown must obtain the consent of Her Majesty before marrying.\"\n  2. **Jump up ^** Most sources, including _Whitaker 's Almanack_, exclude her as a [confirmed](/wiki/Confirmation \"Confirmation\") Catholic, but Debrett's includes her in line.\n  3. **Jump up ^** Albert and Leopold Windsor were listed on [The Official Website of the British Monarchy](https://www.royal.uk/succession) until 2015 and in the 2013 edition of _Whitaker 's Almanack_ as following Estella Taylor (b 2004) and eligible to succeed; [MSN News](http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/photos/britains-royal-line-of-succession/ss-BBj3lVx#image=37), Debrett's and _Whitaker 's Almanack_ 2015 lists them after Lady Amelia Windsor and before Lady Helen Taylor.
