Convinced of her worth by the quality of her cooking and her\ninsistence on finishing her chores before she would leave with him, he\nproposes and she accepts despite knowing each other for only a few hours.\n\nOn the journey home Milly talks about how she is excited to be cooking and\ntaking care of only one man, visibly upsetting Adam. When they arrive at his\ncabin in the mountains, Milly is surprised to learn that Adam is one of seven\nbrothers living under the same roof. The brothers have been named\nalphabetically from the [Old Testament](/wiki/Old_Testament \"Old Testament\")\nin order of birth: Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank (short for\nfrankincense, the Old Testament having no names beginning with F), and Gideon.\nAll of the brothers have red hair and all but Gideon are well over six feet\ntall. Understandably sad about having to tend to the needs of not one, but\nseven men, and with an idea to solve the situation, a smart and reasonable\nMilly decides to marry Adam's brothers off to some girls from the town.\n\nDuring an attempt to accomplish this, Milly teaches Adam's rowdy, ill-behaved\nyounger brothers some manners and social mores. She also shows them how to\ndance. At first, the brothers have a hard time changing from their \"mountain\nman\" ways, but eventually each comes to see that the only way he will get a\nwoman of his own is to do things Milly's way. They try out their new manners\nand make an attempt to begin courting the girls. This takes place at a social\ngathering in the town (dance + barn-raising), where they meet six women they\nlike – Dorcas, Ruth, Martha, Liza, Sarah, and Alice. The girls take a fancy to\nthe brothers as well. However, they already have suitors among the young men\nof the town, who jealously taunt the brothers into fighting during the barn-\nraising. At first the six brothers remember Milly's teaching and try to resist\nbeing drawn into a fight by accepting physical indignities. Adam refuses to\nlet himself be pushed around by the rival suitors and calls his younger\nbrothers cowards for letting them get away with their behavior. The girls'\nsuitors from the town finally go too far when they attack Adam, provoking\nGideon into fighting back. A free-for-all ensues in which the brothers\ndominate their physically weaker townie rivals. Although the Pontipees did not\nstart the fight, they are banished from the town after demolishing the barn\nthey were raising in the course of the brawl.\n\nWinter finds the six younger brothers pining for the girls for whom they had\nfallen fast and hard. Milly asks Adam to talk to the brothers as she fears\nthey will want to leave because of missing the girls. Adam reads his brothers\nthe story of \"The Sobbin' Women\" (taken from [Plutarch](/wiki/Plutarch\n\"Plutarch\")'s story of [the Sabine Women](/wiki/The_Rape_of_the_Sabine_Women\n\"The Rape of the Sabine Women\")), one of the books Milly brought to the\nhomestead. He tells them that they should stop moping around and take whatever\naction is necessary to get their women. Aided by Adam, the brothers kidnap the\nsix girls, then cause an avalanche in Echo Pass so that they cannot be\nfollowed by the townspeople. The only problem: they forgot to bring the parson\nto perform the marriages.\n\nMilly is furious with Adam, as are the six kidnapped women. Milly consigns the\nbrothers to the barn \"with the rest of the livestock\" while the women live in\nthe house. Adam, feeling betrayed by Milly's reaction, leaves for the trapping\ncabin farther up the mountain to live out the winter by himself, unknowingly\nhurting Milly's feelings. Soon after, Milly realizes that she is pregnant by\nAdam.\n\nThe winter months slowly pass. The women vent their frustration and resentment\nby playing pranks on the brothers, such as hitting them with rock-filled\nsnowballs and dumping basins of wash water on them. By spring, the women have\nforgiven their kidnappers and fallen in love with the brothers, who are now\nallowed to court them. Milly gives birth to a daughter, Hannah. Gideon rides\nto the cabin to inform Adam of his daughter's arrival and asks him to come\nhome. Adam refuses, saying that he had said he would return home only when the\nsnow had melted enough that the pass was open to traffic.\n\nHaving time to think about his baby daughter, Adam returns home in the spring\njust as Echo Pass is opening and reconciles with Milly. As a newly responsible\nfather, he has become aware of how worried the townspeople would be about what\nhas happened to the six abducted girls. Adam realizes he was wrong to tell his\nbrothers to kidnap them. He tells his brothers they need to take the women\nback to their homes in town, but his brothers are unwilling. The six women\nalso do not want to return to their homes; they all want to stay at the farm\nwith their new suitors and hide so they will not be taken back home. When\nMilly discovers that the women are not in the house, Adam tells his brothers\nto go after them and bring them back.\n\nThe townspeople arrive with the intention of lynching the Pontipee brothers\nfor the kidnappings. Upon finding the brothers trying to force the women to\nreturn, the fathers believe their daughters are being assaulted and charge to\ntheir rescue. Alice's father ([Ian Wolfe](/wiki/Ian_Wolfe \"Ian Wolfe\")), a\npreacher, hears baby Hannah cry in the distance, and worries that the baby\nmight belong to one of the kidnapped girls. The fathers and other townsmen\nround up the Pontipees and announce they intend to hang them.\n\nAlice's father, the Reverend Alcott, asks the women whose baby he had heard.\nThey all decide, simultaneously, to claim the baby as their own. This\nmisinformation gives the women and the brothers their wish: the townspeople,\nincluding the girls' fathers, insist that all six couples marry at once in a\n[shotgun wedding](/wiki/Shotgun_wedding \"Shotgun wedding\"), performed by the\nparson while Adam and Milly watch and the fathers stand behind their\ndaughters' grooms, shotguns over their arms.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Seven_Brides_for_Seven_Brothers&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\nThe Brothers and their Brides:\n\n  * [Howard Keel](/wiki/Howard_Keel \"Howard Keel\") as Adam and [Jane Powell](/wiki/Jane_Powell \"Jane Powell\") as Milly\n  * [Jeff Richards](/wiki/Jeff_Richards_\\(baseball_player/actor\\) \"Jeff Richards \\(baseball player/actor\\)\") as Benjamin and [Julie Newmar (Newmeyer)](/wiki/Julie_Newmar \"Julie Newmar\") as Dorcas\n  * [Matt Mattox](/wiki/Matt_Mattox \"Matt Mattox\") as Caleb and [Ruta Lee (Kilmonis)](/wiki/Ruta_Lee \"Ruta Lee\") as Ruth\n  * [Marc Platt](/wiki/Marc_Platt_\\(dancer\\) \"Marc Platt \\(dancer\\)\") as Daniel and Norma Doggett as Martha\n  * [Jacques d'Amboise](/wiki/Jacques_d%27Amboise_\\(dancer\\) \"Jacques d'Amboise \\(dancer\\)\") as Ephraim and [Virginia Gibson](/wiki/Virginia_Gibson \"Virginia Gibson\") as Liza\n  * [Tommy Rall](/wiki/Tommy_Rall \"Tommy Rall\") as Frank and Betty Carr as Sarah\n  * [Russ Tamblyn](/wiki/Russ_Tamblyn \"Russ Tamblyn\") as Gideon and Nancy Kilgas as Alice\n\n###\nBrothers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Seven_Brides_for_Seven_Brothers&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Brothers\")]\n\nTo perform the dance numbers and action sequences, choreographer [Michael\nKidd](/wiki/Michael_Kidd \"Michael Kidd\") wanted dancers to portray all six of\nAdam Pontipee's brothers. Kidd said that he \"had to find a way to have these\nbackwoods men dance without looking ridiculous. I had to base it all around\nactivities you would accept from such people – it couldn't look like ballet.\nAnd it could only have been done by superbly trained dancers.\" However, he was\nable to integrate into the cast two non-dancer MGM contract players who were\nassigned to the film, Jeff Richards, who performed just the simpler dance\nnumbers, and [Russ Tamblyn](/wiki/Russ_Tamblyn \"Russ Tamblyn\"), utilizing him\nin the dance numbers by exploiting his talents as a gymnast and tumbler.[4][5]\n\nThe other four brothers were portrayed by professional dancers – Matt Mattox,\nMarc Platt, Tommy Rall, and Jacques d'Amboise.

We'd be laughed out of the house.\"[11]\n\nLyricist Johnny Mercer said that the musical numbers were written at Kidd's\nbehest, as an example \"of how a songwriter sometimes has to take his cue from\nhis collaborators.\"[12] For example, Kidd explained to Mercer and dePaul his\nconception of the \"Lonesome Polecat\" number, the lament of the brothers for\nthe women, and the two worked out the music and lyrics.[12]\n\nIn his introduction to a showing on Turner Classic Movies on January 17, 2009,\nhost [Robert Osborne](/wiki/Robert_Osborne \"Robert Osborne\"), as well as [Jane\nPowell](/wiki/Jane_Powell \"Jane Powell\") in her autobiography, _The Girl Next\nDoor,_ both say MGM was much less interested in _Seven Brides_ than it was in\n_[Brigadoon](/wiki/Brigadoon_\\(film\\) \"Brigadoon \\(film\\)\")_ which was also\nfilming at the time, even cutting its budget and transferring the money to the\n[Lerner and Loewe](/wiki/Lerner_and_Loewe \"Lerner and Loewe\") vehicle.[10]\n\nMost of the movie was shot on the MGM sound stages. One exterior sequence not\nfilmed at the studio was shot on location at Corral Creek Canyon in Sun\nValley, Idaho. It was here that the escape following the brothers' kidnapping\ntheir future brides and the avalanche that closed the pass was filmed.[13]\n\nOn the 2004 DVD commentary, Stanley Donen states that the film was originally\nshot in two versions, one in [CinemaScope](/wiki/CinemaScope \"CinemaScope\")\nand another in normal ratio, because MGM was concerned that not all theaters\nhad the capability to screen it. Despite the fact that it cost more than the\nwidescreen version to make, he says, the other version was never used. However\nboth versions are available on the 2004 DVD release.\n\nThe dresses worn by the female cast were made from old quilts that costume\ndesigner [Walter Plunkett](/wiki/Walter_Plunkett \"Walter Plunkett\") found at\n[the Salvation Army](/wiki/The_Salvation_Army \"The Salvation Army\").[10]\n\n## Songs and\nmusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Seven_Brides_for_Seven_Brothers&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Songs and music\")]\n\nThe \"Main Title\" is a medley of the songs \"Sobbin' Women\", \"Bless Your\nBeautiful Hide\" and \"Wonderful, Wonderful Day\".\n\nIn the film, Matt Mattox's voice is dubbed in by Bill Lee on \"Lonesome\nPolecat\".
