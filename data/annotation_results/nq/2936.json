The signatory for Nepal was\n[Raj Guru Gajraj\nMishra](/w/index.php?title=Raj_Guru_Gajraj_Mishra&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Raj\nGuru Gajraj Mishra \\(page does not exist\\)\") aided by [Chandra Sekher\nUpadhayaya](/w/index.php?title=Chandra_Sekher_Upadhayaya&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Chandra Sekher Upadhayaya \\(page does not exist\\)\"), the signatory for the\nCompany was Lieutenant Colonel [Paris\nBradshaw](/w/index.php?title=Paris_Bradshaw&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Paris\nBradshaw \\(page does not exist\\)\"). The treaty called for territorial\nconcessions in which some of the territories controlled by Nepal would be\ngiven to British India, the establishment of a British representative in\n[Kathmandu](/wiki/Kathmandu \"Kathmandu\"), and allowed Britain to recruit\n[Gurkhas](/wiki/Gurkha \"Gurkha\") for military service. Nepal also lost the\nright to deploy any American or European employee in its service (earlier\nseveral French commanders had been deployed to train the Nepali army).\n\nUnder the treaty, some of the Nepalese controlled territory was lost including\nall the territories that the King of Nepal had won in wars in the last 25\nyears or so such as [Sikkim](/wiki/Sikkim \"Sikkim\") in the east, [Kumaon\nKingdom](/wiki/Kumaon_Kingdom \"Kumaon Kingdom\") and [Garhwal\nKingdom](/wiki/Garhwal_Kingdom \"Garhwal Kingdom\") (also known as Gadhwal) in\nthe west. Some of the [Terai](/wiki/Terai \"Terai\") lands were restored to\nNepal in 1816 and more were restored in 1860 to thank for helping the British\nto suppress the [Indian rebellion of 1857](/wiki/Indian_rebellion_of_1857\n\"Indian rebellion of 1857\").\n\nThe British representative in Kathmandu was the first Westerner allowed to\nlive in the post-Malla Era Nepal. (It is to be noted that few [Christian\nmissionaries](/wiki/Christian_mission \"Christian mission\") operating were\ndeported by the Gorkhas after conquering Nepal during the mid 18th century).\nThe first representative was Edward Gardner, who was installed at a compound\nnorth of Kathmandu. That site is now called Lazimpat and is home to the Indian\nand British [embassies](/wiki/Embassy \"Embassy\").\n\nThe Sugauli Treaty was superseded in December 1923 by a \"treaty of perpetual\npeace and friendship,\" which upgraded the British\n[resident](/wiki/Resident_\\(title\\) \"Resident \\(title\\)\") to an envoy. A\nseparate treaty was signed with [India](/wiki/India \"India\") (independent by\nnow) in 1950 which established relations between the two countries.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Terms\n  * 3 Validity of the treaty\n  * 4 Indo-Nepal boundary conflict\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Treaty_of_Sugauli&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nThe territories under Nepalese control included [Darjeeling](/wiki/Darjeeling\n\"Darjeeling\") to the South-east, whole of [Sikkim](/wiki/Sikkim \"Sikkim\") to\nthe east, [Nainital](/wiki/Nainital \"Nainital\") to the south-west and the\n[Kumaon Kingdom](/wiki/Kumaon_Kingdom \"Kumaon Kingdom\") and [Garhwal\nKingdom](/wiki/Garhwal_Kingdom \"Garhwal Kingdom\") to the west.\n\n## Terms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Treaty_of_Sugauli&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Terms\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png) |  This article may **require[cleanup](/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup \"Wikipedia:Cleanup\")** to meet Wikipedia's [quality standards](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style\").

It was agreed upon on 2 December 1815 by Raj Guru Gajaraj\nMishra aided by Chandra Sekher Upadhyaya on behalf of the government of Nepal\nand Lt. Col. Paris Bradshaw on behalf of the Company. The signed copies of the\ntreaty were exchanged on 4 March 1816 at [Makawanpur](/wiki/Makwanpur_District\n\"Makwanpur District\") by Chandra Sekhar Upadhayay and General [David\nOchterlony](/wiki/David_Ochterlony \"David Ochterlony\"). The terms of the\ntreaty were as follows:-\n\n  1. There shall be perpetual peace and friendship between the East India company and Nepal.\n  2. The king of Nepal will renounce all claim to the lands which were the subject of discussion between the two States before the war; and will acknowledge the right of the company to the sovereignty of those lands.\n  3. The king of Nepal will cede to the East India company in perpetuity all the under mentioned territories: i) The whole of low lands between the rivers Kali and Rapti. ii) The whole of low lands between Rapti and Gandaki, except Butwal. iii) The whole of low lands between Gandaki and Koshi in which the authority of the East India company has been established. iv) The whole of low lands between the rivers Mechi and Burma. v) The whole of territories within the hills eastward of the [Mechi river](/wiki/Mechi_River \"Mechi River\"). The aforesaid territory shall be evacuated by the Gorkha troops within forty days from this date.\n  4. With a view to indemnify the chiefs and Bhardars of Nepal, whose interest will suffer by the alienation of the lands ceded by the foregoing Article (No. 3 above), the East India company agrees to settle pensions to the aggregate amount of two lakhs of rupees per annum on such chiefs as may be decided by the king of Nepal.\n  5. The king of Nepal renounces for himself, his heirs, and successors, all claim to the territories lying to the West of the River Kali, and engaged never to have any concern with the appointed rulers of those territories or the inhabitants thereof.\n  6. The king of Nepal engages never to molest or disturb the king of Sikkim in the possession of his territories. If any difference shall arise between Nepal and Sikkim, it shall be referred to the arbitration of the East India company.\n  7. The king of Nepal hereby engages never to take or retain in his service any British subject, nor the subject of any European or American State, without the consent of the British Government.\n  8. In order to secure and improve the relations of amity and peace hereby established between Nepal and Britain (East India company), it is agreed that [accredited Ministers](/wiki/List_of_British_Resident_Ministers_in_Nepal \"List of British Resident Ministers in Nepal\") from each shall reside at the court of the other.\n  9. This treaty shall be ratified by the King of Nepal within 15 days from this date, and the ratification shall be delivered to Lt. Col. Bradshaw, who engages to obtain and deliver to the king the ratification of the Governor-General within 20 days, or sooner, if practicable.\n\nDONE at Sugauli, on the 2nd day of December 1815. PARIS BRADSHAW, LT.-COL.,\nP.A.\n\nReceived this treaty from Chandra Shekhar Upadhyaya, Agent on the part of the\nRaja of Nepal, in the valley of Makwanpoor, at half-past two o'clock p.m. on 4\nMarch 1816, and delivered to them the Counterpart Treaty on behalf of the\nBritish Government.\n\n[DD. OCHTERLONY](/wiki/David_Ochterlony \"David Ochterlony\"), Agent, Governor-\nGeneral Memorandum for the approval and acceptance of the Raja of Nepal,\npresented on 8 December 1816 ADVERTING to the amity and confidence subsisting\nwith the Raja of Nepal, the British Government proposes to suppress as much as\npossible, the execution of certain Articles in the Treaty of Sugauli, which\nbear hard upon the Rajah as follows:\n\nWith a view to gratify the Rajah in a point which he has much at heart, the\nBritish Government is willing to return the territories of Terai ceded to it\nby the Rajah in the Treaty, to wit, the whole Terai lands lying between the\nRivers Kushwaha and Gandak, such as appertained to the Rajah before the late\ndisagreement; excepting the disputed lands in the Jillas of Tirhoot and Sarun,\nand excepting such portions of territory as may occur on both sides for the\npurpose of settling a frontier, upon investigation by the respective\nCommissioners; and excepting such lands as may have been given in possession\nto any one by the British Government upon ascertainment of his rights\nsubsequent to the cession of Terai to the Government. In case the Rajah is\ndesirous of retaining the lands of such ascertained proprietors, they may be\nexchanged for others, and let it be clearly understood that, notwithstanding\nthe considerable extent of the lands in the Jilla of Tirhoot, which have for a\nlong time been a subject of dispute, the settlement made in the year 1812 of\nChrist, corresponding with year 1869 of Bikram Sambat, shall be taken, and\neverything else relinquished, that is to say, that the settlement and\nnegotiations, such as occurred at that period, shall in the present case hold\ngood and be established.\n\nThe British Government is willing likewise to return the territories of Terai\nlying between the Rivers Gandak and Rapti, that is to say, from the River\nGandak to the western limits of the Jilla of Gorakhpur, together with Butwal\nand Sheeraj, such as appertained to Nepal previous to the disagreements,\ncomplete, with the exception of the disputed places in the Terai, and such\nquantity of ground as may be considered mutually to be requisite for the new\nboundary.\n\nAs it is impossible to establish desirable limits between the two States\nwithout survey, it will be expedient that Commissioners be appointed on both\nsides for the purpose of arranging in concert a well defined boundary on the\nbasis of the preceding terms, and of establishing a straight line of frontier,\nwith a view to the distinct separation of the respective territories of the\nBritish Government to the south and of Nepal to the north; and in case any\nindentations occur to destroy the even tenor of the line, the Commissioners\nshould effect an exchange of lands so interfering on principles of clear\nreciprocity.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAnd should it occur that the proprietors of lands situated on the mutual\nfrontier, as it may be rectified, whether holding of the British Government of\nthe Raja of Nepal, should be placed in the condition of subjects to both\nGovernments, with a view to prevent continual dispute and discussion between\nthe two Governments, the respective Commissioners should effect in mutual\nconcurrence and co-operation the exchange of such lands, so as to render them\nsubject to one dominion alone.\n\nIn the event of the Rajah's approving the foregoing terms, the proposed\narrangement for the survey and establishment of boundary marks shall be\ncarried into execution, and after the determination in concert, of the\nboundary line, Sunnuds conformable to the foregoing stipulations, drawn out\nand sealed by the two States, shall be delivered and accepted on both sides.\n\nEDWARD GARDNER Resident Substance of a Letter under the Seal of the Raja of\nNepal, received on 11 December 1816\n\nAfter compliments : I have comprehended the document under date 8 December\n1816, or 4th of Push, 1873 Sambat, which you transmitted relative to the\nrestoration, with a view to my friendship and satisfaction, of the Terai\nbetween the Rivers Kushwaha and Rapti to the southern boundary complete, such\nas appertained to my estate previous to the war. It mentioned that in the\nevent of my accepting the terms contained in that document, the southern\nboundary of the Terai should be established as it was held by this Government.\n\nI have accordingly agreed to the terms laid down by you, and herewith enclose\nan instrument of agreement, which may be satisfactory to you. Moreover, it was\nwritten in the document transmitted by you, that it should be restored, with\nthe exception of the disputed lands and such portion of land as should, in the\nopinion of the Commissioners on both sides, occur for the purpose of settling\na boundary; and excepting the lands which, after the cessions of the Terai to\nthe Honourable Company, may have been transferred by it to the ascertained\nproprietors. My friend, all these matters rest with you, and since it was also\nwritten that a view was had to my friendship and satisfactions with respect to\ncertain Articles of the Treaty of Sugauli, which bore hard upon me, and which\ncould be remitted, I am well assured that you have at heart the removal of\nwhatever may tend to my distress, and that you will act in a manner\ncorresponding to the advantage of this State and the increase of the friendly\nrelations subsisting between the two Governments.\n\nMoreover I have to acknowledge the receipt of the orders under the red seal of\nthis State, addressed to the officers of Terai between the Rivers Gandak and\nRapti, for the surrender of that Terai, and their retiring from thence, which\nwas given to you at Thankote, according to your request, and which you have\nnow returned for my satisfaction.\n\nSubstance of a Document under the Red Seal, received from the Durbar, on 11\nDecember 1816 With regard to friendship and amity, the Government of Nepal\nagrees to the tenor of the document under date 8 December 1816 or 4th Poos\n1873 Sambat which was received by the Durbar from the Honourable Edward\nGardner on the part of the Honorable Company, respecting the revertance of the\nTerai between the Rivers Kushwaha and Rapti to the former southern boundary,\nsuch as appertained to Nepal previous to the war, with exception of the\ndisputed lands.\n\nDated the 7th of Push 1873 Sambat\n\nA subsequent agreement was made in December 1816 according to which Nepal got\nall the low lands (Terai) from Mechi, in the east, to Mahakali, in the west.\nTherefore, the indemnity of two lakhs of rupees ceased to continue. A land\nsurvey was also proposed to fix the boundary between the two States.\n\n## Validity of the\ntreaty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Treaty_of_Sugauli&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Validity of the treaty\")]\n\n1\\. Article 9 of the treaty says that the treaty shall be approved by the King\nof Nepal, but records of the treaty being approved by [King Girvan Yuddha\nBikram Shah](/wiki/Girvan_Yuddha_Bikram_Shah_Deva \"Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah\nDeva\") have not been conclusively traced.\n\n2\\. The British had feared that Nepal might not implement the treaty signed on\n4 March 1816 by Chandra Shekhar Upadhyaya. Therefore, General [David\nOchterlony](/wiki/David_Ochterlony \"David Ochterlony\"), on behalf of the\nBritish Government, ratified the treaty the same day and the counterpart\ntreaty was handed over to Upadhyaya.\n\n3\\. Some Nepalese [nationalists](/wiki/Nationalist \"Nationalist\") have argued\nthat the treaty was signed between the [Nepalese\nKingdom](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Nepal \"Kingdom of Nepal\") and the\n[British](/wiki/East_India_Company \"East India Company\") and thus \"lacks the\nforce to be implemented\" between [Republic of Nepal](/wiki/Republic_of_Nepal\n\"Republic of Nepal\") and [Republic of India](/wiki/Republic_of_India \"Republic\nof India\"). However, the [Republic of Nepal](/wiki/Republic_of_Nepal \"Republic\nof Nepal\") has assumed the duties and responsibilities of essentially all\nother treaties signed by the predecessor [Kingdom of\nNepal](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Nepal \"Kingdom of Nepal\"), including membership in the\n[United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\") and other comparable\nrelationships. But there exists no treaty or any other legal and formal\nconclusion that this Sugauli Treaty will be followed by these two independent\nnations [Nepal](/wiki/Nepal \"Nepal\") and [India](/wiki/India\n\"India\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Indo-Nepal
