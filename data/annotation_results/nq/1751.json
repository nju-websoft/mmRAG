[revolutions](/wiki/Revolution\n\"Revolution\") in [Russia](/wiki/Russian_Empire \"Russian Empire\") in 1917 which\ndismantled the [Tsarist autocracy](/wiki/Tsarist_autocracy \"Tsarist\nautocracy\") and led to the rise of the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union\n\"Soviet Union\"). The [Russian Empire](/wiki/Russian_Empire \"Russian Empire\")\ncollapsed with the abdication of [Emperor](/wiki/List_of_Russian_rulers \"List\nof Russian rulers\") [Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia \"Nicholas II of\nRussia\") and the old regime was replaced by a [provisional\ngovernment](/wiki/Provisional_government \"Provisional government\") during the\nfirst revolution of February 1917 (March in the [Gregorian\ncalendar](/wiki/Gregorian_calendar \"Gregorian calendar\"); the older [Julian\ncalendar](/wiki/Julian_calendar \"Julian calendar\") was in use in Russia at the\ntime). Alongside it arose grassroots community assemblies (called\n'[soviets](/wiki/Soviet_\\(council\\) \"Soviet \\(council\\)\")') which contended\nfor authority. In the second revolution that October, the Provisional\nGovernment was toppled and all power was given to the soviets.\n\nThe [February Revolution](/wiki/February_Revolution \"February Revolution\")\n(March 1917) was a revolution focused around Petrograd (now [Saint\nPetersburg](/wiki/Saint_Petersburg \"Saint Petersburg\")), the capital of Russia\nat that time. In the chaos, members of the Imperial parliament (the\n[Duma](/wiki/State_Duma_of_the_Russian_Empire \"State Duma of the Russian\nEmpire\")) assumed control of the country, forming the [Russian Provisional\nGovernment](/wiki/Russian_Provisional_Government \"Russian Provisional\nGovernment\") which was heavily dominated by the interests of large capitalists\nand the noble aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the\nmeans to suppress the revolution, resulting in Nicholas's abdication. The\nsoviets, which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working\nclass, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on\na prerogative to influence the government and control various\n[militias](/wiki/Militias \"Militias\"). The February Revolution took place in\nthe context of heavy military setbacks during the [First World\nWar](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\") (1914–18), which left much of the\nRussian Army in a state of mutiny.\n\nA period of [dual power](/wiki/Dual_power \"Dual power\") ensued, during which\nthe Provisional Government held state power while the national network of\nsoviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and,\nincreasingly, the [left](/wiki/Left-wing_politics \"Left-wing\npolitics\")-leaning urban middle class. During this chaotic period there were\nfrequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. Many socialist political\norganizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the\nDuma and the soviets, central among which were the\n[Bolsheviks](/wiki/Bolsheviks \"Bolsheviks\") (\"Ones of the Majority\") led by\n[Vladimir Lenin](/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin \"Vladimir Lenin\") who campaigned for an\nimmediate end to the war, land to the peasants, and bread to the workers. When\nthe Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany,\nthe Bolsheviks and other socialist factions were able to exploit virtually\nuniversal disdain towards the war effort as justification to advance the\nrevolution further. The Bolsheviks turned workers' militias under their\ncontrol into the [Red Guards](/wiki/Red_Guards_\\(Russia\\) \"Red Guards\n\\(Russia\\)\") (later the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army \"Red Army\")) over which they\nexerted substantial control.[1]\n\nIn the [October Revolution](/wiki/October_Revolution \"October Revolution\")\n(November in the Gregorian calendar), the Bolsheviks led an armed insurrection\nby workers and soldiers in Petrograd that successfully overthrew the\nProvisional Government, transferring all its authority to the soviets with the\ncapital being relocated to [Moscow](/wiki/Moscow \"Moscow\") shortly thereafter.\nThe Bolsheviks had secured a strong base of support within the soviets and, as\nthe now supreme governing party, established a [federal\ngovernment](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic \"Russian Soviet\nFederative Socialist Republic\") dedicated to reorganizing the former empire\ninto the world's first socialist republic, practicing [soviet\ndemocracy](/wiki/Soviet_democracy \"Soviet democracy\") on a national and\ninternational scale. The promise to end Russia’s participation in the First\nWorld War was honored promptly with the Bolshevik leaders signing the [Treaty\nof Brest-Litovsk](/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-\nLitovsk_\\(Russia%E2%80%93Central_Powers\\) \"Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\n\\(Russia–Central Powers\\)\") with Germany in March 1918. To further secure the\nnew state, the [Cheka](/wiki/Cheka \"Cheka\") was established which functioned\nas a revolutionary security service that sought to weed out and punish those\nconsidered to be \"enemies of the people\" in campaigns consciously modeled on\nsimilar events during the [French Revolution](/wiki/French_Revolution \"French\nRevolution\").\n\nSoon after, [civil war](/wiki/Russian_Civil_War \"Russian Civil War\") erupted\namong the \"Reds\" (Bolsheviks), the \"[Whites](/wiki/White_movement \"White\nmovement\")\" ([counter-revolutionaries](/wiki/Counter-revolutionary \"Counter-\nrevolutionary\")), the [independence movements](/wiki/Pro-\nindependence_movements_in_Russian_Civil_War \"Pro-independence movements in\nRussian Civil War\") and the [non-Bolshevik socialists](/wiki/Left-\nwing_uprisings_against_the_Bolsheviks \"Left-wing uprisings against the\nBolsheviks\"). It continued for several years, during which the Bolsheviks\ndefeated both the Whites and all rival socialists and thereafter reconstituted\nthemselves as the [Communist Party](/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union\n\"Communist Party of the Soviet Union\"). In this way, the Revolution paved the\nway for [the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n(USSR)](/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Creation_of_the_USSR \"Treaty on the Creation of\nthe USSR\") in 1922. While many notable historical events occurred in Moscow\nand Petrograd, there was also a visible movement in cities throughout the\nstate, among national minorities throughout the empire and in the rural areas,\nwhere [peasants](/wiki/Peasant \"Peasant\") took over and redistributed land.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n    * 1.1 Economic and social changes\n    * 1.2 Political issues\n    * 1.3 World War I\n  * 2 February Revolution\n  * 3 Between February and throughout October: \"Dual Power\" (_dvoevlastie_)\n  * 4 October Revolution\n  * 5 Russian Civil War\n  * 6 Execution of the imperial family\n  * 7 The revolution and the world\n  * 8 Historiography\n  * 9 Chronology\n    * 9.1 Chronology of events leading to the revolution\n    * 9.2 Chronology of the 1917 revolutions\n  * 10 Cultural portrayal\n    * 10.1 Film\n  * 11 See also\n  * 12 Footnotes\n  * 13 Notes\n  * 14 Further reading\n    * 14.1 Historiography\n    * 14.2 Participants' accounts\n    * 14.3 Primary documents\n  * 15 External links\n\n## Background\n\nMain article: [Russian history,\n1892–1917](/wiki/Russian_history,_1892%E2%80%931917 \"Russian history,\n1892–1917\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/U_Narvskikh_vorot.jpg/275px-\nU_Narvskikh_vorot.jpg)](/wiki/File:U_Narvskikh_vorot.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:U_Narvskikh_vorot.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSoldiers blocking [Narva Gate](/wiki/Narva_Triumphal_Arch \"Narva Triumphal\nArch\") on [Bloody Sunday](/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_\\(1905\\) \"Bloody Sunday\n\\(1905\\)\")\n\nThe [Russian Revolution of 1905](/wiki/Revolution_of_1905 \"Revolution of\n1905\") was said to be a major factor contributing to the cause of the\nRevolutions of 1917. The events of [Bloody\nSunday](/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_\\(1905\\) \"Bloody Sunday \\(1905\\)\") triggered\nnationwide protests and soldier mutinies. A council of workers called the [St.\nPetersburg Soviet](/wiki/St._Petersburg_Soviet \"St. Petersburg Soviet\") was\ncreated in this chaos.[2] While the 1905 Revolution was ultimately crushed,\nand the leaders of the St. Petersburg Soviet were arrested, this laid the\ngroundwork for the later Petrograd Soviet and other revolutionary movements\nduring the leadup to 1917. The 1905 Revolution also led to the creation of a\nDuma (parliament), that would later form the Provisional Government following\nFebruary 1917.[3]\n\nThe outbreak of [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\") prompted\ngeneral outcry directed at [Tsar Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia\n\"Nicholas II of Russia\") and the Romanov family. While the nation was\ninitially caught up in a wave of nationalism, increasing numbers of defeats\nand poor conditions soon made the opposite true. The Tsar attempted to remedy\nthe situation by taking personal control of the army in 1915. This proved\ndisastrous, as the Tsar was now held personally responsible for Russia's\ncontinuing defeats and losses. In addition, the [Tsarina\nAlexandra](/wiki/Alexandra_Feodorovna_\\(Alix_of_Hesse\\) \"Alexandra Feodorovna\n\\(Alix of Hesse\\)\"), left to rule in while the Tsar was commanding at the\nfront, was German born, leading to suspicion of collusion, only exacerbated by\nrumors relating to her relationship with the controversial mystic\n[Rasputin](/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin \"Grigori Rasputin\"). Rasputin's influence\nled to disastrous ministerial appointments and corruption, resulting in a\nworsening of conditions within Russia. This led to general dissatisfaction\nwith the Romanov family, and was a major factor contributing to the\nretaliation of the Russian Communists against the royal family.[3]\n\nAfter the entry of the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman Empire\")\non the side of the Central Powers in October 1914, Russia was deprived of a\nmajor trade route through the Dardanelles, which further contributed to the\neconomic crisis, in which Russia became incapable of providing\n[munitions](/wiki/Munitions \"Munitions\") to their army in the years leading to\n1917. However, the problems were primarily administrative, and not industrial,\nas Germany was producing great amounts of munitions whilst constantly fighting\non two major battlefronts.[4]\n\nThe conditions during the war resulted in devastating loss of morale within\nthe Russian army, as well as the general population. This was particularly\napparent in the cities, owing to a lack of food in response to the disruption\nof agriculture. Food scarcity had become a considerable problem in Russia, but\nthe cause of this did not lie in any failure of the [harvests](/wiki/Harvests\n\"Harvests\"), which had not been significantly altered during wartime. The\nindirect reason was that the government, in order to finance the war, had been\nprinting millions of ruble notes, and by 1917 inflation had made prices\nincrease up to four times what they had been in 1914. Farmers were\nconsequently faced with a higher cost of living, but little increase in\nincome. As a result, they tended to hoard their grain and to revert to\n[subsistence farming](/wiki/Subsistence_agriculture \"Subsistence\nagriculture\"). Thus the cities were constantly short of food. At the same\ntime, rising prices led to demands for higher wages in the factories, and in\nJanuary and February 1916 revolutionary [propaganda](/wiki/Propaganda\n\"Propaganda\"), in part aided by German funds, led to widespread strikes. This\nresulted in a growing criticism of the government, including an increased\nparticipation of workers in revolutionary parties.\n\nLiberal parties too had an increased platform to voice their complaints, as\nthe initial fervor of the war had resulted in the Tsarist government creating\na variety of political organizations. In July 1915, a Central War Industries\nCommittee was established under the chairmanship of a prominent\n[Octobrist](/wiki/October_Revolution \"October Revolution\"), [Alexander\nGuchkov](/wiki/Alexander_Guchkov \"Alexander Guchkov\") (1862-1936), including\nten workers' representatives. The Petrograd [Mensheviks](/wiki/Menshevik\n\"Menshevik\") agreed to join despite the objections of their leaders abroad.\nAll this activity gave renewed encouragement to political ambitions, and, in\nSeptember 1915, a combination of Octobrists and\n[Kadets](/wiki/Constitutional_Democratic_Party \"Constitutional Democratic\nParty\") in the [Duma](/wiki/Duma \"Duma\") demanded the forming of a responsible\ngovernment. The [Tsar](/wiki/Tsar_Nicholas_II \"Tsar Nicholas II\") rejected\nthese proposals.[5]\n\nAll these factors had given rise to a sharp loss of confidence in the regime,\neven within the ruling class, growing throughout the war. Early in 1916,\n[Guchkov](/wiki/Guchkov \"Guchkov\") discussed with senior army officers and\nmembers of the Central War Industries Committee about a possible coup to force\nthe abdication of the Tsar. In December, a small group of nobles assassinated\n[Rasputin](/wiki/Rasputin \"Rasputin\"), and in January 1917 the Tsar's uncle,\n[Grand Duke Nicholas](/wiki/Grand_Duke_Nicholas \"Grand Duke Nicholas\"), was\nasked indirectly by [Prince Lvov](/wiki/Georgy_Lvov \"Georgy Lvov\") whether he\nwould be prepared to take over the throne from his nephew, Tsar Nicholas II.\nNone of these incidents were in themselves the immediate cause of the February\nRevolution, but they do help to explain why the monarchy survived only a few\ndays after it had broken out.[5]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Soldiers_demonstration.February_1917.jpg/275px-\nSoldiers_demonstration.February_1917.jpg)](/wiki/File:Soldiers_demonstration.February_1917.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Soldiers_demonstration.February_1917.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRussian soldiers marching in Petrograd in February 1917\n\nMeanwhile, Socialist Revolutionary leaders in exile, many of them living in\n[Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland \"Switzerland\"), had been the glum spectators\nof the collapse of international socialist solidarity. French and German\nSocial Democrats had voted in favour of their respective governments' war\nefforts. [Georgi Plekhanov](/wiki/Georgi_Plekhanov \"Georgi Plekhanov\") in\n[Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\") had adopted a violently anti-German stand, while\n[Parvus](/wiki/Parvus \"Parvus\") supported the German war effort as the best\nmeans of ensuring a revolution in Russia. The Mensheviks largely maintained\nthat Russia had the right to defend herself against Germany, although\n[Martov](/wiki/Martov \"Martov\") (a prominent Menshevik), now on the left of\nhis group, demanded an end to the war and a settlement on the basis of\nnational self-determination, with no [annexations](/wiki/Annexation\n\"Annexation\") or [indemnities](/wiki/Indemnity \"Indemnity\").[5]\n\nIt was these views of Martov that predominated in a manifesto drawn up by\n[Leon Trotsky](/wiki/Leon_Trotsky \"Leon Trotsky\") (at the time a Menshevik) at\na conference in [Zimmerwald](/wiki/Zimmerwald \"Zimmerwald\"), attended by 35\nSocialist leaders in September 1915. Inevitably [Vladimir\nLenin](/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin \"Vladimir Lenin\"), supported by\n[Zinoviev](/wiki/Grigory_Zinoviev \"Grigory Zinoviev\") and [Radek](/wiki/Radek\n\"Radek\"), strongly contested them. Their attitudes became known as the\nZimmerwald Left. Lenin rejected both the defence of Russia and the cry for\npeace. Since the autumn of 1914, he had insisted that \"from the standpoint of\nthe working class and of the labouring masses from the lesser evil would be\nthe defeat of the Tsarist Monarchy\"; the war must be turned into a civil war\nof the proletarian soldiers against their own governments, and if a\nproletarian victory should emerge from this in Russia, then their duty would\nbe to wage a revolutionary war for the liberation of the masses throughout\nEurope.[6]\n\n### Economic and social changes\n\nAn elementary theory of property, believed by many peasants, was that land\nshould belong to those who work on it. At the same time, peasant life and\nculture was changing constantly. Change was facilitated by the physical\nmovement of growing numbers of peasant villagers who migrated to and from\nindustrial and urban environments, but also by the introduction of city\nculture into the village through material goods, the press, and word of\nmouth.[nb 1]\n\nWorkers also had good reasons for discontent: overcrowded housing with often\ndeplorable sanitary conditions, long hours at work (on the eve of the war a\n10-hour workday six days a week was the average and many were working 11–12\nhours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from poor safety and\nsanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen's\nfists), and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep wartime increases\nin the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of\nbenefits, though these could be just as dangerous, from the point of view of\nsocial and political stability, as the hardships. There were many\nencouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many\nworkers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and\ndesires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as they had\nnever seen in villages. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to\nnew ideas about the social and political order.[nb 2]\n\nThe social causes of the Russian Revolution mainly came from centuries of\noppression of the lower classes by the Tsarist regime, and Nicholas's failures\nin World War I. While rural agrarian peasants had been\n[emancipated](/wiki/Emancipation_of_the_serfs \"Emancipation of the serfs\")\nfrom [serfdom](/wiki/Serfdom \"Serfdom\") in 1861, they still resented paying\nredemption payments to the state, and demanded communal tender of the land\nthey worked. The problem was further compounded by the failure of [Sergei\nWitte](/wiki/Sergei_Witte \"Sergei Witte\")'s land reforms of the early 20th\ncentury. Increasing peasant disturbances and sometimes actual revolts\noccurred, with the goal of securing ownership of the land they worked. Russia\nconsisted mainly of poor farming peasants, with 1.5% of the population owning\n25% of the land.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe rapid industrialization of Russia also resulted in urban overcrowding and\npoor conditions for urban industrial workers (as mentioned above). Between\n1890 and 1910, the population of the capital, Saint Petersburg, swelled from\n1,033,600 to 1,905,600, with Moscow experiencing similar growth. This created\na new 'proletariat' which, due to being crowded together in the cities, was\nmuch more likely to protest and go on strike than the peasantry had been in\nprevious times. In one 1904 survey, it was found that an average of sixteen\npeople shared each apartment in Saint Petersburg, with six people per room.\nThere was also no running water, and piles of human waste were a threat to the\nhealth of the workers. The poor conditions only aggravated the situation, with\nthe number of strikes and incidents of public disorder rapidly increasing in\nthe years shortly before World War I. Because of late industrialization,\nRussia's workers were highly concentrated. By 1914, 40% of Russian workers\nwere employed in factories of 1,000+ workers (32% in 1901). 42% worked in\n100–1,000 worker enterprises, 18% in 1–100 worker businesses (in the US, 1914,\nthe figures were 18, 47 and 35 respectively).[7]\n\nYears | Average annual strikes[8]  \n---|---  \n1862–69 | 6  \n1870–84 | 20  \n1885–94 | 33  \n1895–1905 | 176  \n  \nWorld War I added to the chaos. Conscription swept up the unwilling across\nRussia. The vast demand for factory production of war supplies and workers\ncaused many more labor riots and strikes. Conscription stripped skilled\nworkers from the cities, who had to be replaced with unskilled peasants, and\nthen, when famine began to hit due to the poor railway system, workers\nabandoned the cities in droves seeking food. Finally, the soldiers themselves,\nwho suffered from a lack of equipment and protection from the elements, began\nto turn against the Tsar. This was mainly because, as the war progressed, many\nof the officers who were loyal to the Tsar were killed, and were replaced by\ndiscontented conscripts from the major cities, who had little loyalty to the\nTsar.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/1917petrogradsoviet_assembly.jpg/330px-1917petrogradsoviet_assembly.jpg)](/wiki/File:1917petrogradsoviet_assembly.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1917petrogradsoviet_assembly.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Petrograd Soviet Assembly](/wiki/Petrograd_Soviet_Assembly \"Petrograd\nSoviet Assembly\") meeting in 1917\n\n### Political issues\n\nMany sections of the country had reason to be dissatisfied with the existing\nautocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict\nauthoritarian system. Individuals and society in general were expected to show\nself-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy and a\nsense of duty to the country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets\ntogether as a source of comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult\nconditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy.\nPerhaps more than any other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and\nthe future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and\ninfallible father to his people.[nb 3]\n\nThis idealized vision of the Romanov monarchy blinded him to the actual state\nof his country. With a firm belief that his power to rule was granted by\n[Divine Right](/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings \"Divine right of kings\"), Nicholas\nassumed that the Russian people were devoted to him with unquestioning\nloyalty. This ironclad belief rendered Nicholas unwilling to allow the\nprogressive reforms that might have alleviated the suffering of the Russian\npeople. Even after the 1905 revolution spurred the Tsar to decree limited\ncivil rights and democratic representation, he worked to limit even these\nliberties in order to preserve the ultimate authority of the crown.[nb 3]\n\nDespite constant oppression, the desire of the people for democratic\nparticipation in government decisions was strong. Since the [Age of\nEnlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment \"Age of Enlightenment\"), Russian\nintellectuals had promoted Enlightenment ideals such as the dignity of the\nindividual and the rectitude of democratic representation. These ideals were\nchampioned most vociferously by Russia’s liberals, although populists,\nMarxists, and anarchists also claimed to support democratic reforms. A growing\nopposition movement had begun to challenge the Romanov monarchy openly well\nbefore the turmoil of World War I.\n\nDissatisfaction with Russian autocracy culminated in the huge national\nupheaval that followed the [Bloody Sunday](/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_\\(1905\\)\n\"Bloody Sunday \\(1905\\)\") massacre of January 1905, in which hundreds of\nunarmed protesters were shot by the Tsar's troops. Workers responded to the\nmassacre with a crippling general strike, forcing Nicholas to put forth the\n[October Manifesto](/wiki/October_Manifesto \"October Manifesto\"), which\nestablished a democratically elected parliament (the [State\nDuma](/wiki/Duma#State_Duma_in_Imperial_Russia \"Duma\")). The Tsar undermined\nthis promise of reform but a year later with Article 87 of the 1906\n[Fundamental State Laws](/wiki/Russian_Constitution_of_1906 \"Russian\nConstitution of 1906\"), and subsequently dismissed the first two Dumas when\nthey proved uncooperative. Unfulfilled hopes of democracy fueled revolutionary\nideas and violent outbursts targeted at the monarchy.\n\nOne of the Tsar’s principal rationales for risking war in 1914 was his desire\nto restore the prestige that Russia had lost amid the debacles of the [Russo-\nJapanese war](/wiki/Russo-Japanese_war \"Russo-Japanese war\"). Nicholas also\nsought to foster a greater sense of national unity with a war against a common\nand ancient enemy. The Russian Empire was an agglomeration of diverse\nethnicities that had shown significant signs of disunity in the years before\nthe First World War. Nicholas believed in part that the shared peril and\ntribulation of a foreign war would mitigate the social unrest over the\npersistent issues of poverty, inequality, and inhuman working conditions.\nInstead of restoring Russia's political and military standing, [World War\nI](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\") led to the horrifying slaughter of Russian\ntroops and military defeats that undermined both the monarchy and society in\ngeneral to the point of collapse.\n\n### World War I\n\nThe outbreak of war in August 1914 initially served to quiet the prevalent\nsocial and political protests, focusing hostilities against a common external\nenemy, but this patriotic unity did not last long. As the war dragged on\ninconclusively, war-weariness gradually took its toll. More important, though,\nwas a deeper fragility: although many ordinary Russians joined anti-German\ndemonstrations in the first few weeks of the war, the most widespread reaction\nappears to have been skepticism and fatalism. Hostility toward the Kaiser and\nthe desire to defend their land and their lives did not necessarily translate\ninto enthusiasm for the Tsar or the government.[9][10][11]\n\nRussia's first major battle of the war was a disaster: in the 1914 [Battle of\nTannenberg](/wiki/Battle_of_Tannenberg_\\(1914\\) \"Battle of Tannenberg\n\\(1914\\)\"), over 30,000 Russian troops were killed or wounded and 90,000\ncaptured, while Germany suffered just 12,000 casualties. However, [Austro-\nHungarian](/wiki/Austria-Hungary \"Austria-Hungary\") forces allied to Germany\nwere driven back deep into the [Galicia](/wiki/Battle_of_Galicia \"Battle of\nGalicia\") region by the end of the year. In the autumn of 1915, Nicholas had\ntaken direct command of the army, personally overseeing Russia's main theatre\nof war and leaving his ambitious but incapable wife Alexandra in charge of the\ngovernment. Reports of corruption and incompetence in the Imperial government\nbegan to emerge, and the growing influence of [Grigori\nRasputin](/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin \"Grigori Rasputin\") in the Imperial family\nwas widely resented. In the eyes of Michael Lynch, a revisionist historian\n(member of the School of Historical Studies at the University of Leicester)\nwho focuses on the role of the people, Rasputin was a \"fatal disease\" to the\nTsarist regime.\n\nIn 1915, things took a critical turn for the worse when Germany shifted its\nfocus of attack to the Eastern front. The superior German army – better led,\nbetter trained and better supplied – was terrifyingly effective against the\nill-equipped Russian forces, driving the Russians out of Galicia, as well as\nRussian Poland, during the [Gorlice–Tarnów\nOffensive](/wiki/Gorlice%E2%80%93Tarn%C3%B3w_Offensive \"Gorlice–Tarnów\nOffensive\") campaign. By the end of October 1916, Russia had lost between\n1,600,000 and 1,800,000 soldiers, with an additional 2,000,000 prisoners of\nwar and 1,000,000 missing, all making up a total of nearly 5,000,000 men.\n\nThese staggering losses played a definite role in the mutinies and revolts\nthat began to occur. In 1916, reports of fraternizing with the enemy started\nto circulate. Soldiers went hungry, and lacked shoes, munitions, and even\nweapons. Rampant discontent lowered morale, which was further undermined by a\nseries of military defeats.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Russian_Troops_NGM-v31-p379.jpg/205px-\nRussian_Troops_NGM-v31-p379.jpg)](/wiki/File:Russian_Troops_NGM-v31-p379.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Russian_Troops_NGM-v31-p379.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRussian troops awaiting German attack in trenches\n\nCasualty rates were the most vivid sign of this disaster. Already, by the end\nof 1914, only five months into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost\ntheir lives and nearly 1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected,\nbarely trained recruits had to be called up for active duty, a process\nrepeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount. The\nofficer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower\nechelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks.\nThese men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a\nlarge role in the politicization of the troops in 1917.\n\nThe huge losses on the battlefields were not limited to men. The army quickly\nran short of rifles and ammunition (as well as uniforms and food), and, by\nmid-1915, men were being sent to the front bearing no arms. It was hoped that\nthey could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen\nsoldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. The soldiers did not feel that\nthey were being treated as valuable soldiers, or even as human beings, but\nrather as raw materials to be squandered for the purposes of the rich and\npowerful.\n\nBy the spring of 1915, the army was in steady retreat, which was not always\norderly; desertion, plunder and chaotic flight were not uncommon. By 1916,\nhowever, the situation had improved in many respects. Russian troops stopped\nretreating, and there were even some modest successes in the offensives that\nwere staged that year, albeit at great loss of life. Also, the problem of\nshortages was largely solved by a major effort to increase domestic\nproduction. Nevertheless, by the end of 1916, morale among soldiers was even\nworse than it had been during the [great retreat of\n1915](/wiki/Great_Retreat_\\(Russia\\) \"Great Retreat \\(Russia\\)\"). The fortunes\nof war may have improved, but the fact of the war, still draining away\nstrength and lives from the country and its many individuals and families,\nremained an oppressive inevitability. The crisis in morale (as was argued by\nAllan Wildman, a leading historian of the Russian army in war and revolution)\n\"was rooted fundamentally in the feeling of utter despair that the slaughter\nwould ever end and that anything resembling victory could be achieved.\"[12]\n\nThe war devastated not only soldiers. By the end of 1915, there were manifold\nsigns that the economy was breaking down under the heightened strain of\nwartime demand. The main problems were food shortages and rising prices.\nInflation dragged incomes down at an alarmingly rapid rate, and shortages made\nit difficult to buy even what one could afford. These shortages were a problem\nespecially in the capital, [St. Petersburg](/wiki/St._Petersburg \"St.\nPetersburg\"), where distance from supplies and poor transportation networks\nmade matters particularly bad. Shops closed early or entirely for lack of\nbread, sugar, meat and other provisions, and lines lengthened massively for\nwhat remained. It became increasingly difficult both to afford and actually\nbuy food.\n\nNot surprisingly, strikes increased steadily from the middle of 1915, and so\ndid crime; but, for the most part, people suffered and endured, scouring the\ncity for food. Working class women in St. Petersburg reportedly spent about\nforty hours a week in food lines, begging, turning to prostitution or crime,\ntearing down wooden fences to keep stoves heated for warmth, grumbling about\nthe rich, and wondering when and how this would all come to an end.\n\nGovernment officials responsible for public order worried about how long\npeople's patience would last. A report by the St. Petersburg branch of the\nsecurity police, the [Okhrana](/wiki/Okhrana \"Okhrana\"), in October 1916,\nwarned bluntly of \"the possibility in the near future of riots by the lower\nclasses of the empire enraged by the burdens of daily existence.\"[13]\n\nNicholas was blamed for all of these crises, and what little support he had\nleft began to crumble. As discontent grew, the [State Duma](/wiki/State_Duma\n\"State Duma\") issued a warning to Nicholas in November 1916. It stated that,\ninevitably, a terrible disaster would grip the country unless a constitutional\nform of government was put in place. Nicholas ignored these warnings and\nRussia's Tsarist regime collapsed a few months later during the February\nRevolution of 1917. One year later, the Tsar and his entire family were\nexecuted.\n\n## February Revolution\n\nMain article: [February Revolution](/wiki/February_Revolution \"February\nRevolution\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Feb_1917.jpg/250px-\nFeb_1917.jpg)](/wiki/File:Feb_1917.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Feb_1917.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRevolutionaries protesting in February 1917\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/RJB23_%E2%80%93_Friede_1917_1.jpg/250px-\nRJB23_%E2%80%93_Friede_1917_1.jpg)](/wiki/File:RJB23_%E2%80%93_Friede_1917_1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:RJB23_%E2%80%93_Friede_1917_1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMeeting Germans in No Man's Land\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/RJB23_%E2%80%93_Friede_1917_2.jpg/250px-\nRJB23_%E2%80%93_Friede_1917_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:RJB23_%E2%80%93_Friede_1917_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:RJB23_%E2%80%93_Friede_1917_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMeeting before the Russian wire entanglements\n\nAt the beginning of February, [Petrograd](/wiki/Petrograd \"Petrograd\") workers\nbegan several [strikes](/wiki/Strike_action \"Strike action\") and\n[demonstrations](/wiki/Demonstration_\\(people\\) \"Demonstration\n\\(people\\)\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] On 7 March\n[[O.S.](/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates \"Old Style and New Style dates\")\n22 February], workers at [Putilov](/wiki/Putilov_plant \"Putilov plant\"),\nPetrograd's largest industrial plant, announced a strike.[14]\n\nThe next day, a series of meetings and rallies were held for [International\nWomen's Day](/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day \"International Women's Day\"),\nwhich gradually turned into economic and political gatherings. Demonstrations\nwere organised to demand [bread](/wiki/Bread \"Bread\"), and these were\nsupported by the industrial working force who considered them a reason for\ncontinuing the strikes. The women workers marched to nearby factories bringing\nout over 50,000 workers on strike.[15] By 10 March\n[[O.S.](/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates \"Old Style and New Style dates\")\n25 February], virtually every industrial enterprise in Petrograd had been shut\ndown, together with many commercial and service enterprises. Students, white-\ncollar workers and teachers joined the workers in the streets and at public\nmeetings.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nTo quell the riots, the Tsar looked to the army. At least 180,000 troops were\navailable in the capital, but most were either untrained or injured. Historian\n[Ian Beckett](/w/index.php?title=Ian_Beckett&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Ian\nBeckett \\(page does not exist\\)\") suggests around 12,000 could be regarded as\nreliable, but even these proved reluctant to move in on the crowd, since it\nincluded so many women. It was for this reason that when, on 11 March\n[[O.S.](/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates \"Old Style and New Style dates\")\n26 February], the Tsar ordered the army to suppress the rioting by force,\ntroops began to mutiny.[16] Although few actively joined the rioting, many\nofficers were either shot or went into hiding; the ability of the garrison to\nhold back the protests was all but nullified, symbols of the Tsarist regime\nwere rapidly torn down around the city, and governmental authority in the\ncapital collapsed – not helped by the fact that Nicholas had prorogued the\nDuma that morning, leaving it with no legal authority to act. The response of\nthe Duma, urged on by the liberal bloc, was to establish a Temporary Committee\nto restore law and order; meanwhile, the socialist parties establish the\nPetrograd Soviet to represent workers and soldiers. The remaining loyal units\nswitched allegiance the next day.[17]\n\nThe Tsar directed the royal train back towards Petrograd, which was stopped 14\nMarch [[O.S.](/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates \"Old Style and New Style\ndates\") 1 March],[16] by a group of revolutionaries at [Malaya\nVishera](/wiki/Malaya_Vishera \"Malaya Vishera\"). When the Tsar finally arrived\nat in [Pskov](/wiki/Pskov \"Pskov\"), the Army Chief [Nikolai\nRuzsky](/wiki/Nikolai_Ruzsky \"Nikolai Ruzsky\"), and the Duma deputees\n[Guchkov](/wiki/Guchkov \"Guchkov\") and [Vasily Shulgin](/wiki/Vasily_Shulgin\n\"Vasily Shulgin\") suggested in unison that he abdicate the throne. He did so\non 15 March [[O.S.](/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates \"Old Style and New\nStyle dates\") 2 March], on behalf of himself, and then, having taken advice,\non behalf of his son, the\n[Tsarevich](/wiki/Alexei_Nikolaevich,_Tsarevich_of_Russia \"Alexei Nikolaevich,\nTsarevich of Russia\").[16] Nicholas nominated his brother, the [Grand Duke\nMichael Alexandrovich](/wiki/Grand_Duke_Michael_Alexandrovich_of_Russia \"Grand\nDuke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia\"), to succeed him. But the Grand Duke\nrealised that he would have little support as ruler, so he declined the crown\non 16 March [[O.S.](/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates \"Old Style and New\nStyle dates\") 3 March],[16] stating that he would take it only if that was the\nconsensus of democratic action.[18] Six days later, Nicholas, no longer Tsar\nand addressed with contempt by the sentries as \"Nicholas Romanov\", was\nreunited with his family at the [Alexander Palace](/wiki/Alexander_Palace\n\"Alexander Palace\") at [Tsarskoye Selo](/wiki/Tsarskoye_Selo \"Tsarskoye\nSelo\").[19] He was placed under [house arrest](/wiki/House_arrest \"House\narrest\") with his family by the Provisional Government.\n\nThe immediate effect of the February Revolution was a widespread atmosphere of\nelation and excitement in Petrograd.[20] On 16 March\n[[O.S.](/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates \"Old Style and New Style dates\") 3\nMarch], a [provisional government](/wiki/Russian_Provisional_Government\n\"Russian Provisional Government\") was announced. The center-left was well\nrepresented, and the government was initially chaired by a liberal aristocrat,\n[Prince Georgy Yevgenievich Lvov](/wiki/Georgy_Lvov \"Georgy Lvov\"), a member\nof the [Constitutional Democratic party](/wiki/Constitutional_Democratic_party\n\"Constitutional Democratic party\") (KD).[21] The socialists had formed their\nrival body, the [Petrograd Soviet](/wiki/Petrograd_Soviet \"Petrograd Soviet\")\n(or workers' council) four days earlier. The Petrograd Soviet and the\nProvisional Government competed for power over Russia.\n\n## Between February and throughout October: \"Dual Power\" (_dvoevlastie_)\n\nThe effective power of the Provisional Government was challenged by the\nauthority of an institution that claimed to represent the will of workers and\nsoldiers and could, in fact, mobilize and control these groups during the\nearly months of the revolution – the Petrograd Soviet [Council] of Workers'\nDeputies. The model for the soviet were workers' councils that had been\nestablished in scores of Russian cities during the 1905 Revolution. In\nFebruary 1917, striking workers elected deputies to represent them and\nsocialist activists began organizing a citywide council to unite these\ndeputies with representatives of the socialist parties. On 27 February,\nsocialist Duma deputies, mainly [Mensheviks](/wiki/Menshevik \"Menshevik\") and\nSocialist Revolutionaries, took the lead in organizing a citywide council. The\nPetrograd Soviet met in the [Tauride Palace](/wiki/Tauride_Palace \"Tauride\nPalace\"), the same building where the new government was taking shape.\n\nThe leaders of the Petrograd Soviet believed that they represented particular\nclasses of the population, not the whole nation. They also believed Russia was\nnot ready for socialism. So they saw their role as limited to pressuring\nhesitant \"bourgeoisie\" to rule and to introduce extensive democratic reforms\nin Russia (the replacement of the monarchy by a republic, guaranteed civil\nrights, a democratic police and army, abolition of religious and ethnic\ndiscrimination, preparation of elections to a constituent assembly, and so\non).[22] They met in the same building as the emerging Provisional Government\nnot to compete with the Duma Committee for state power but to best exert\npressure on the new government, to act, in other words, as a popular\ndemocratic lobby.\n\nThe relationship between these two major powers was complex from the beginning\nand would shape the politics of 1917. The representatives of the Provisional\nGovernment agreed to \"take into account the opinions of the Soviet of Workers'\nDeputies\", though they were also determined to prevent \"interference in the\nactions of the government\", which would create \"an unacceptable situation of\ndual power.\"[23] In fact, this was precisely what was being created, though\nthis \"dual power\" (dvoevlastie) was the result less of the actions or\nattitudes of the leaders of these two institutions than of actions outside\ntheir control, especially the ongoing social movement taking place on the\nstreets of Russia’s cities, in factories and shops, in barracks and in the\ntrenches, and in the villages.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Batall%C3%B3nDeLaMuerteDesfilandoAnteElPalacioDeInvierno\n--historywartimes14londuoft.jpg/300px-\nBatall%C3%B3nDeLaMuerteDesfilandoAnteElPalacioDeInvierno--\nhistorywartimes14londuoft.jpg)](/wiki/File:Batall%C3%B3nDeLaMuerteDesfilandoAnteElPalacioDeInvierno\n--historywartimes14londuoft.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Batall%C3%B3nDeLaMuerteDesfilandoAnteElPalacioDeInvierno--\nhistorywartimes14londuoft.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe 2nd Moscow Women Death Battalion protecting the Winter Palace as the last\nguards of the stronghold.\n\nA series of political crises – see the chronology below – in the relationship\nbetween population and government and between the Provisional Government and\nthe soviets (which developed into a nationwide movement with a national\nleadership, The All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets (VTsIK))\nundermined the authority of the Provisional Government but also of the\nmoderate socialist leaders of the Soviet. Although the Soviet leadership\ninitially refused to participate in the \"bourgeois\" Provisional Government,\n[Alexander Kerensky](/wiki/Alexander_Kerensky \"Alexander Kerensky\"), a young\nand popular lawyer and a member of the [Socialist Revolutionary\nParty](/wiki/Socialist-Revolutionaries \"Socialist-Revolutionaries\") (SRP),\nagreed to join the new cabinet, and became an increasingly central figure in\nthe government, eventually taking leadership of the Provisional Government. As\nminister of war and later Prime Minister, Kerensky promoted freedom of speech,\nreleased thousands of political prisoners, did his very best to continue the\nwar effort and even organised another offensive (which, however, was no more\nsuccessful than its predecessors). Nevertheless, Kerensky still faced several\ngreat challenges, highlighted by the soldiers, urban workers and peasants, who\nclaimed that they had gained nothing by the revolution:\n\n  * Other political groups were trying to undermine him.\n  * Heavy military losses were being suffered on the front.\n  * The soldiers were dissatisfied and demoralised and had started to defect. (On arrival back in Russia, these soldiers were either imprisoned or sent straight back into the front.)\n  * There was enormous discontent with Russia's involvement in the war, and many were calling for an end to it.\n  * There were great shortages of food and supplies, which was difficult to remedy because of the wartime economic conditions.\n\nThe political group that proved most troublesome for Kerensky, and would\neventually overthrow him, was the Bolshevik Party, led by [Vladimir\nLenin](/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin \"Vladimir Lenin\"). Lenin had been living in exile\nin neutral Switzerland and, due to democratization of politics after the\nFebruary Revolution, which legalized formerly banned political parties, he\nperceived the opportunity for his Marxist revolution. Although return to\nRussia had become a possibility, the war made it logistically difficult.\nEventually, German officials arranged for Lenin to pass through their\nterritory, hoping that his activities would weaken Russia or even – if the\nBolsheviks came to power – led to Russia's withdrawal from the war. Lenin and\nhis associates, however, had to agree to travel to Russia in a sealed train:\nGermany would not take the chance that he would foment revolution in Germany.\nAfter passing through the front, he arrived in Petrograd in April 1917.\n\nOn the way to Russia, Lenin prepared the [April Theses](/wiki/April_Theses\n\"April Theses\"), which outlined central Bolshevik policies. These included\nthat the soviets take power (as seen in the slogan \"all power to the soviets\")\nand denouncing the liberals and social revolutionaries in the Provisional\nGovernment, forbidding co-operation with it. Many Bolsheviks, however, had\nsupported the Provisional Government, including [Lev\nKamenev](/wiki/Lev_Kamenev \"Lev Kamenev\").

Over the course of the spring, public\ndissatisfaction with the Provisional Government and the war, in particular\namong workers, soldiers and peasants, pushed these groups to radical parties.\nDespite growing support for the Bolsheviks, buoyed by maxims that called most\nfamously for \"all power to the Soviets,\" the party held very little real power\nin the moderate-dominated Petrograd Soviet. In fact, historians such as Sheila\nFitzpatrick have asserted that Lenin's exhortations for the Soviet Council to\ntake power were intended to arouse indignation both with the Provisional\nGovernment, whose policies were viewed as conservative, and the Soviet itself,\nwhich was viewed as subservient to the conservative government. By some\nhistorians' accounts, Lenin and his followers were unprepared for how their\ngroundswell of support, especially among influential worker and soldier\ngroups, would translate into real power in the summer of 1917.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Revoluci%C3%B3n-marzo-\nrusia--russianbolshevik00rossuoft.png/300px-Revoluci%C3%B3n-marzo-rusia--\nrussianbolshevik00rossuoft.png)](/wiki/File:Revoluci%C3%B3n-marzo-rusia--\nrussianbolshevik00rossuoft.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Revoluci%C3%B3n-marzo-rusia--russianbolshevik00rossuoft.png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nSoviets attacking the tsarist police in the early days of the March\nRevolution.\n\nOn 18 June, the Provisional Government launched an attack against Germany that\nfailed miserably. Soon after, the government ordered soldiers to go to the\nfront, reneging on a promise. The soldiers refused to follow the new orders.\nThe arrival of radical [Kronstadt](/wiki/Kronstadt \"Kronstadt\") sailors – who\nhad tried and executed many officers, including one admiral – further fueled\nthe growing revolutionary atmosphere. The sailors and soldiers, along with\nPetrograd workers, took to the streets in violent protest, calling for \"all\npower to the Soviets.\" The revolt, however, was disowned by Lenin[25] and the\nBolshevik leaders and dissipated within a few days. In the aftermath, Lenin\nfled to [Finland](/wiki/Finland \"Finland\") under threat of arrest while\n[Trotsky](/wiki/Trotsky \"Trotsky\"), among other prominent Bolsheviks, was\narrested. The [July Days](/wiki/July_Days \"July Days\") confirmed the\npopularity of the anti-war, radical Bolsheviks, but their unpreparedness at\nthe moment of revolt was an embarrassing gaffe that lost them support among\ntheir main constituent groups: soldiers and workers.\n\nThe Bolshevik failure in the July Days proved temporary. The Bolsheviks had\nundergone a spectacular growth in membership. Whereas, in February 1917, the\nBolsheviks were limited to only 24,000 members, by September 1917 there were\n200,000 members of the Bolshevik faction.[26] Previously, the Bolsheviks had\nbeen in the minority in the two leading cities of Russia—St. Petersburg and\nMoscow behind the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, by September\nthe Bolsheviks were in the majority in both cities.[27] Furthermore, the\nBolshevik-controlled Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party also controlled the\nParty organizations of the thirteen (13) provinces around Moscow. These\nthirteen provinces held 37% of Russia's population and 20% of the membership\nof the Bolshevik faction.[27]\n\nIn August, poor or misleading communication led General [Lavr\nKornilov](/wiki/Lavr_Kornilov \"Lavr Kornilov\"), the recently appointed Supreme\nCommander of Russian military forces, to believe that the Petrograd government\nhad already been captured by radicals, or was in serious danger\nthereof.[_[dubious](/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement\n\"Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute\") –\n[discuss](/wiki/Talk:Russian_Revolution#Kornilov_Affair \"Talk:Russian\nRevolution\")_] In response, he ordered troops to Petrograd to pacify the city.\nTo secure his position, Kerensky had to ask for Bolshevik assistance. He also\nsought help from the Petrograd Soviet, which called upon armed Red Guards to\n\"defend the revolution\". The [Kornilov Affair](/wiki/Kornilov_Affair \"Kornilov\nAffair\") failed largely due to the efforts of the Bolsheviks, whose influence\nover railroad and telegraph workers proved vital in stopping the movement of\ntroops. With his coup failing, Kornilov surrendered and was relieved of his\nposition. The Bolsheviks' role in stopping the attempted coup further\nstrengthened their position.\n\nIn early September, the Petrograd Soviet freed all jailed Bolsheviks and\nTrotsky became chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. Growing numbers of socialists\nand lower-class Russians viewed the government less and less as a force in\nsupport of their needs and interests. The Bolsheviks benefited as the only\nmajor organized opposition party that had refused to compromise with the\nProvisional Government, and they benefited from growing frustration and even\ndisgust with other parties, such as the Mensheviks and Socialist\nRevolutionaries, who stubbornly refused to break with the idea of national\nunity across all classes.\n\nIn Finland, Lenin had worked on his book _[State and\nRevolution](/wiki/State_and_Revolution \"State and Revolution\")_[28] and\ncontinued to lead his party, writing newspaper articles and policy decrees. By\nOctober, he returned to Petrograd (St. Petersburg), aware that the\nincreasingly radical city presented him no legal danger and a second\nopportunity for revolution. Recognising the strength of the Bolsheviks, Lenin\nbegan pressing for the immediate overthrow of the Kerensky government by the\nBolsheviks. Lenin was of the opinion that taking power should occur in both\nSt. Petersburg and Moscow simultaneously, parenthetically stating that it made\nno difference which city rose up first, but expressing his opinion that Moscow\nmay well rise up first.[29] The Bolshevik Central Committee drafted a\nresolution, calling for the dissolution of the Provisional Government in favor\nof the Petrograd Soviet. The resolution was passed 10–2 ([Lev\nKamenev](/wiki/Lev_Kamenev \"Lev Kamenev\") and [Grigory\nZinoviev](/wiki/Grigory_Zinoviev \"Grigory Zinoviev\") prominently dissenting)\nand the [October Revolution](/wiki/October_Revolution \"October Revolution\")\nbegan.\n\n## October Revolution\n\nMain article: [October Revolution](/wiki/October_Revolution \"October\nRevolution\")\n\nThe October Revolution was led by [Vladimir Lenin](/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin\n\"Vladimir Lenin\") and was based upon Lenin's writing on the ideas of [Karl\nMarx](/wiki/Karl_Marx \"Karl Marx\"), a political ideology often known as\n[Marxism–Leninism](/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism \"Marxism–Leninism\"). It\nmarked the beginning of the spread of [communism](/wiki/Communism \"Communism\")\nin the 20th century. It was far less sporadic than the revolution of February\nand came about as the result of deliberate planning and coordinated activity\nto that end.\n\nThough Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik Party, it has been argued that\nsince Lenin was not present during the actual takeover of the Winter Palace,\nit was really [Trotsky's](/wiki/Leon_Trotsky \"Leon Trotsky\") organization and\ndirection that led the revolution, merely spurred by the motivation Lenin\ninstigated within his party.[30] Critics on the Right have long argued that\nthe financial and logistical assistance of German intelligence via their key\nagent, [Alexander Parvus](/wiki/Alexander_Parvus \"Alexander Parvus\") was a key\ncomponent as well, though historians are divided, since there is little\nevidence supporting that claim.\n\nOn 7 November 1917, [Bolshevik](/wiki/Bolshevik \"Bolshevik\") leader [Vladimir\nLenin](/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin \"Vladimir Lenin\") led his leftist revolutionaries\nin a revolt against the ineffective Provisional Government (Russia was still\nusing the [Julian calendar](/wiki/Julian_calendar \"Julian calendar\") at the\ntime, so period references show a 25 October date). The October revolution\nended the phase of the revolution instigated in February, replacing Russia's\nshort-lived provisional parliamentary government with government by\n[soviets](/wiki/Soviet_\\(council\\) \"Soviet \\(council\\)\"), local councils\nelected by bodies of workers and peasants. Liberal and monarchist forces,\nloosely organized into the [White Army](/wiki/White_Army \"White Army\"),\nimmediately went to war against the Bolsheviks' [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army \"Red\nArmy\"), in a series of battles that would become known as the Russian Civil\nWar.\n\nSoviet membership was initially freely elected, but many members of the\n[Socialist Revolutionary Party](/wiki/Socialist_Revolutionary_Party \"Socialist\nRevolutionary Party\"), anarchists, and other leftists created opposition to\nthe Bolsheviks through the soviets themselves. When it became clear that the\nBolsheviks had little support outside of the industrialized areas of Saint\nPetersburg and Moscow, they simply barred non-Bolsheviks from membership in\nthe soviets.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Not surprisingly, this caused mass domestic\ntension with many individuals who called for another series of political\nreform, revolting, and calling for \"a third Russian revolution,\" a movement\nthat received a significant amount of support. The most notable instances of\nthis anti-Bolshevik mentality were expressed in the [Tambov\nrebellion](/wiki/Tambov_rebellion \"Tambov rebellion\"), 1919–1921, and the\n[Kronstadt rebellion](/wiki/Kronstadt_rebellion \"Kronstadt rebellion\") in\nMarch 1921. These movements, which made a wide range of demands and lacked\neffective coordination, were eventually defeated along with the White Army\nduring the [Civil War](/wiki/Russian_Civil_War \"Russian Civil War\").\n\n## Russian Civil War\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Intervenci%C3%B3nInternacionalEnVladivostok\n--throughrussianre00willuoft.jpg/350px-\nIntervenci%C3%B3nInternacionalEnVladivostok--\nthroughrussianre00willuoft.jpg)](/wiki/File:Intervenci%C3%B3nInternacionalEnVladivostok\n--throughrussianre00willuoft.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Intervenci%C3%B3nInternacionalEnVladivostok--\nthroughrussianre00willuoft.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAmerican, British, and Japanese Troops parade through Vladivostok in armed\nsupport to the White Army\n\nMain articles: [Russian Civil War](/wiki/Russian_Civil_War \"Russian Civil\nWar\") and [Allied intervention in the Russian Civil\nWar](/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War \"Allied intervention\nin the Russian Civil War\")\n\nThe Russian Civil War, which broke out in 1918 shortly after the October\nRevolution, brought death and suffering to millions of people regardless of\ntheir political orientation. The war was fought mainly between the [Red\nArmy](/wiki/Red_Army \"Red Army\") (\"Reds\"), consisting of the uprising majority\nled by the Bolshevik minority, and the [\"Whites\"](/wiki/White_Movement \"White\nMovement\") – army officers and cossacks, the \"bourgeoisie\", and political\ngroups ranging from the far Right to the Socialist Revolutionaries who opposed\nthe drastic restructuring championed by the Bolsheviks following the collapse\nof the Provisional Government to the soviets (under clear Bolshevik\ndominance).[31][32] The Whites had backing from nations such as Great Britain,\nFrance, USA and Japan, while the Reds possessed internal support which proved\nto be much more effective. Though the Allied nations, using external\ninterference, provided substantial military aid to the loosely knit anti-\nBolshevik forces, they were ultimately defeated.[31]\n\nThe Bolsheviks firstly assumed power in Petrograd, expanding their rule\noutwards. They eventually reached the Easterly Siberian Russian coast in\n[Vladivostok](/wiki/Vladivostok \"Vladivostok\"), 4 years after the war began,\nan occupation that is believed to have ended all significant military\ncampaigns in the nation. Less than one year later the last area controlled by\nthe White Army, the [Ayano-Maysky District](/wiki/Ayano-Maysky_District\n\"Ayano-Maysky District\"), directly to the north of the [Krai](/wiki/Krai\n\"Krai\") containing Vladivostok, was given up when General [Anatoly\nPepelyayev](/wiki/Anatoly_Pepelyayev \"Anatoly Pepelyayev\") capitulated in\n1923.\n\nSeveral revolts were initiated against the Bolsheviks and their army near the\nend of the war, notably the Kronstadt Rebellion. This was a naval mutiny\nengineered by Soviet Baltic sailors, former Red Army soldiers, and the people\nof Kronstadt. This armed uprising was fought against the antagonizing\nBolshevik economic policies that farmers were subjected to, including seizures\nof grain crops by the Communists.[33] This all amounted to large-scale\ndiscontent. When delegates representing the Kronstadt sailors arrived at\nPetrograd for negotiations, they raised 15 demands primarily pertaining to the\nRussian right to freedom.[34] The Government firmly denounced the rebellions\nand labelled the requests as a reminder of the Social Revolutionaries, a\npolitical party that was popular among Soviets before Lenin, but refused to\ncooperate with the Bolshevik Army. The Government then responded with an armed\nsuppression of these revolts and suffered 10 thousand casualties before\nentering the city of Kronstadt.[35] This ended the rebellions fairly quickly,\ncausing many of the rebels to flee to political exile.[36]\n\nDuring the Civil War, [Nestor Makhno](/wiki/Nestor_Makhno \"Nestor Makhno\") led\na Ukrainian [anarchist](/wiki/Anarchist \"Anarchist\") movement, the [Black\nArmy](/wiki/Revolutionary_Insurrectionary_Army_of_Ukraine \"Revolutionary\nInsurrectionary Army of Ukraine\") allied to the Bolsheviks thrice, one of the\npowers ending the alliance each time. However, a Bolshevik force under\n[Mikhail Frunze](/wiki/Mikhail_Frunze \"Mikhail Frunze\") destroyed the\n[Makhnovist](/wiki/Makhnovist \"Makhnovist\") movement, when the Makhnovists\nrefused to merge into the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army \"Red Army\"). In addition,\nthe so-called \"[Green Army](/wiki/Green_armies \"Green armies\")\" (peasants\ndefending their property against the opposing forces) played a secondary role\nin the war, mainly in the Ukraine.\n\n## Execution of the imperial family\n\nMain article: [Shooting of the Romanov\nfamily](/wiki/Shooting_of_the_Romanov_family \"Shooting of the Romanov family\")\n\nThe Bolsheviks executed the tsar and his family on 16 July 1918.[37] In early\nMarch, the Provisional Government placed Nicholas and his family under house\narrest in the [Alexander Palace](/wiki/Alexander_Palace \"Alexander Palace\") at\n[Tsarskoye Selo](/wiki/Tsarskoye_Selo \"Tsarskoye Selo\"), 24 kilometres (15 mi)\nsouth of Petrograd. In August 1917 the [Kerensky](/wiki/Alexander_Kerensky\n\"Alexander Kerensky\") government evacuated the Romanovs to\n[Tobolsk](/wiki/Tobolsk \"Tobolsk\") in the [Urals](/wiki/Urals \"Urals\"), to\nprotect them from the rising tide of revolution. After the Bolsheviks came to\npower in October 1917, the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter and\ntalk of putting Nicholas on trial increased. As the counter revolutionary\nWhite movement gathered force, leading to full-scale civil war by the summer,\nthe Romanovs were moved during April and May 1918 to\n[Yekaterinburg](/wiki/Yekaterinburg \"Yekaterinburg\"), a militant Bolshevik\nstronghold.\n\nDuring the early morning of 16 July, Nicholas, Alexandra, their children,\ntheir physician, and several servants were taken into the basement and shot.\nAccording to Edvard Radzinsky and Dmitrii Volkogonov, the order came directly\nfrom Lenin and Sverdlov in Moscow. That the order came from the top has long\nbeen believed, although there is a lack of hard evidence. The execution may\nhave been carried out on the initiative of local Bolshevik officials, or it\nmay have been an option pre-approved in Moscow should White troops approach\nYekaterinburg. Radzinsky noted that Lenin's bodyguard personally delivered the\ntelegram ordering the execution and that he was ordered to destroy the\nevidence.[38][39]\n\n## The revolution and the world\n\nMain article: [Revolutions of\n1917–1923](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1917%E2%80%931923 \"Revolutions of 1917–1923\")\n\n[Leon Trotsky](/wiki/Leon_Trotsky \"Leon Trotsky\") said that the goal of\n[socialism](/wiki/Socialism \"Socialism\") in Russia would not be realized\nwithout the success of the [world revolution](/wiki/World_revolution \"World\nrevolution\"). Indeed, a [revolutionary wave](/wiki/Revolutionary_wave\n\"Revolutionary wave\") caused by the Russian Revolution lasted until 1923.\nDespite initial hopes for success in the [German Revolution of\n1918–19](/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%9319 \"German Revolution of\n1918–19\"), in the short-lived [Hungarian Soviet\nRepublic](/wiki/Hungarian_Soviet_Republic \"Hungarian Soviet Republic\") and\nothers like it, no other [Marxist](/wiki/Marxism \"Marxism\") movement at the\ntime succeeded in keeping power in its hands.\n\nThis issue is subject to conflicting views on the communist history by various\nMarxist groups and parties. [Joseph Stalin](/wiki/Joseph_Stalin \"Joseph\nStalin\") later rejected this idea, stating that [socialism was possible in one\ncountry](/wiki/Socialism_in_one_country \"Socialism in one country\").\n\nThe confusion regarding Stalin's position on the issue stems from the fact\nthat he, after Lenin's death in 1924, successfully used Lenin's argument – the\nargument that socialism's success needs the workers of other countries in\norder to happen – to defeat his competitors within the party by accusing them\nof betraying Lenin and, therefore, the ideals of the October Revolution.\n\n## Historiography\n\nMain article: [October Revolution §\nHistoriography](/wiki/October_Revolution#Historiography \"October Revolution\")\n\nFew events in historical research have been as conditioned by political\ninfluences as the October Revolution. The\n[historiography](/wiki/Historiography \"Historiography\") of the Revolution\ngenerally divides into three camps: the Soviet-Marxist view, the Western-\nTotalitarian view, and the Revisionist view.[40] Since the fall of Communism\nin Russia in 1991, the Western-Totalitarian view has again become dominant and\nthe Soviet-Marxist view has practically vanished.[41]\n\nLenin's biographer [Robert Service](/wiki/Robert_Service_\\(historian\\) \"Robert\nService \\(historian\\)\"), says he, \"laid the foundations of dictatorship and\nlawlessness. Lenin had consolidated the principle of state penetration of the\nwhole society, its economy and its culture. Lenin had practised terror and\nadvocated revolutionary amoralism.\"[42]\n\n## Chronology\n\n### Chronology of events leading to the revolution\n\n_Dates are correct for the[Julian calendar](/wiki/Julian_calendar \"Julian\ncalendar\"), which was used in Russia until 1918.
