In the types of [sexual reproduction](/wiki/Sexual_reproduction\n\"Sexual reproduction\") known as [anisogamy](/wiki/Anisogamy \"Anisogamy\") and\nits subtype [oogamy](/wiki/Oogamy \"Oogamy\"), there is a marked difference in\nthe size of the [gametes](/wiki/Gamete \"Gamete\") with the smaller one being\ntermed the \"male\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is\n[motile](/wiki/Motility \"Motility\") is referred to as a\n**[spermatozoon](/wiki/Spermatozoon \"Spermatozoon\")** , whereas a non-motile\nsperm cell is referred to as a **spermatium**. Sperm cells cannot divide and\nhave a limited life span, but after fusion with [egg cells](/wiki/Ovum \"Ovum\")\nduring fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a\n[totipotent](/wiki/Totipotency \"Totipotency\") [zygote](/wiki/Zygote \"Zygote\").\nThe [human](/wiki/Human \"Human\") sperm cell is [haploid](/wiki/Haploid\n\"Haploid\"), so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the\nfemale egg to form a [diploid](/wiki/Diploid \"Diploid\") cell. [In\nmammals](/wiki/Mammalian_reproduction \"Mammalian reproduction\"), sperm\ndevelops in the [testicles](/wiki/Testicles \"Testicles\"), stored in the\n[epididymis](/wiki/Epididymis \"Epididymis\"), and is released from the\n[penis](/wiki/Penis \"Penis\").\n\n![File:HumanSpermVideoAffordableHomeMicroscope.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/HumanSpermVideoAffordableHomeMicroscope.ogv/220px\n--HumanSpermVideoAffordableHomeMicroscope.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/HumanSpermVideoAffordableHomeMicroscope.ogv\n\"Play media\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:HumanSpermVideoAffordableHomeMicroscope.ogv \"Enlarge\")\n\nVideo of human sperm cells recorded by an affordable home microscope.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Sperm in animals\n    * 1.1 Function\n    * 1.2 Anatomy\n    * 1.3 Origin\n    * 1.4 Sperm quality\n    * 1.5 Sperm size\n    * 1.6 Market for human sperm\n    * 1.7 History\n    * 1.8 Forensic analysis\n  * 2 Sperm in plants\n  * 3 Motile sperm cells\n  * 4 Non-motile sperm cells\n  * 5 Sperm nuclei\n  * 6 Sperm centrioles\n  * 7 Sperm tail formation\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Sperm in animals\n\nFurther information: [Spermatozoon](/wiki/Spermatozoon \"Spermatozoon\")\n\n### Function\n\nThe main sperm function is to reach the [ovum](/wiki/Ovum \"Ovum\") and fuse\nwith it to deliver two sub-cellular structures: (i) the male\n[pronucleus](/wiki/Pronucleus \"Pronucleus\") that contains the genetic material\nand (ii) the [centrioles](/wiki/Centrioles \"Centrioles\") that are structures\nthat help organize the [microtubule](/wiki/Microtubule \"Microtubule\")\n[cytoskeleton](/wiki/Cytoskeleton \"Cytoskeleton\").\n\n### Anatomy\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Sperm-egg.jpg/200px-\nSperm-egg.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sperm-egg.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sperm-egg.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSperm and egg fusing\n\nThe mammalian sperm cell consists of a head, neck, a midpiece and a tail. The\nhead contains the [nucleus](/wiki/Cell_nucleus \"Cell nucleus\") with densely\ncoiled chromatin fibres, surrounded anteriorly by an [acrosome](/wiki/Acrosome\n\"Acrosome\"), which contains enzymes used for penetrating the female egg. The\nneck contains the sperm [centriole](/wiki/Centriole \"Centriole\"). The midpiece\nhas a central filamentous core with many mitochondria spiralled around it,\nused for [ATP](/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate \"Adenosine triphosphate\")\nproduction for the journey through the female [cervix](/wiki/Cervix \"Cervix\"),\n[uterus](/wiki/Uterus \"Uterus\") and [uterine tubes](/wiki/Uterine_tubes\n\"Uterine tubes\"). The tail or \"[flagellum](/wiki/Flagellum \"Flagellum\")\"\nexecutes the lashing movements that propel the spermatocyte.[1]\n\nDuring [fertilization](/wiki/Fertilization \"Fertilization\"), the sperm\nprovides three essential parts to the [oocyte](/wiki/Oocyte \"Oocyte\"): (1) a\nsignalling or activating factor, which causes the\n[metabolically](/wiki/Metabolically \"Metabolically\") dormant oocyte to\nactivate; (2) the haploid paternal [genome](/wiki/Genome \"Genome\"); (3) the\n[centriole](/wiki/Centriole \"Centriole\"), which is responsible for forming the\n[centrosome](/wiki/Centrosome \"Centrosome\") and\n[microtubule](/wiki/Microtubule \"Microtubule\") system.[2]\n\n### Origin\n\nThe spermatozoa of [animals](/wiki/Animal \"Animal\") are produced through\n[spermatogenesis](/wiki/Spermatogenesis \"Spermatogenesis\") inside the male\n[gonads](/wiki/Gonad \"Gonad\") ([testicles](/wiki/Testicle \"Testicle\")) via\n[meiotic](/wiki/Meiosis \"Meiosis\") division. The initial\n[spermatozoon](/wiki/Spermatozoon \"Spermatozoon\") process takes around 70 days\nto complete. The [spermatid](/wiki/Spermatid \"Spermatid\") stage is where the\nsperm develops the familiar tail. The next stage where it becomes fully mature\ntakes around 60 days when it is called a [spermatozoan](/wiki/Spermatozoan\n\"Spermatozoan\").[3] Sperm cells are carried out of the male body in a fluid\nknown as [semen](/wiki/Semen \"Semen\"). Human sperm cells can survive within\nthe female reproductive tract for more than 5 days post coitus.[4] Semen is\nproduced in the [seminal vesicles](/wiki/Seminal_vesicles \"Seminal vesicles\"),\n[prostate gland](/wiki/Prostate_gland \"Prostate gland\") and [urethral\nglands](/wiki/Urethral_gland \"Urethral gland\").\n\nIn 2016 scientists at [Nanjing Medical\nUniversity](/wiki/Nanjing_Medical_University \"Nanjing Medical University\")\nclaimed they had produced cells resembling mouse spermatids artificially from\n[stem cells](/wiki/Stem_cells \"Stem cells\"). They injected these spermatids\ninto mouse eggs and produced pups.[5]\n\n### Sperm quality\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Sperm_stained.JPG/200px-\nSperm_stained.JPG)](/wiki/File:Sperm_stained.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sperm_stained.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nHuman sperm stained for semen quality testing.\n\nMain article: [Semen quality](/wiki/Semen_quality \"Semen quality\")\n\nSperm [quantity](/wiki/Quantity \"Quantity\") and quality are the main\nparameters in [semen quality](/wiki/Semen_quality \"Semen quality\"), which is a\nmeasure of the ability of [semen](/wiki/Semen \"Semen\") to accomplish\n[fertilization](/wiki/Fertilization \"Fertilization\"). Thus, in humans, it is a\nmeasure of [fertility](/wiki/Fertility \"Fertility\") in a [man](/wiki/Man\n\"Man\"). The genetic quality of sperm, as well as its volume and motility, all\ntypically decrease with age.[6] (See [paternal age\neffect](/wiki/Paternal_age_effect \"Paternal age effect\").)\n\nDNA damages present in sperm cells in the period after [meiosis](/wiki/Meiosis\n\"Meiosis\") but before fertilization may be repaired in the fertilized egg, but\nif not repaired, can have serious deleterious effects on fertility and the\ndeveloping embryo. Human sperm cells are particularly vulnerable to free\nradical attack and the generation of oxidative DNA damage.[7] (see e.g.\n[8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine](/wiki/8-Oxo-2%27-deoxyguanosine\n\"8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine\"))\n\nThe postmeiotic phase of mouse spermatogenesis is very sensitive to\nenvironmental genotoxic agents, because as male germ cells form mature sperm\nthey progressively lose the ability to repair DNA damage.[8] Irradiation of\nmale mice during late spermatogenesis can induce damage that persists for at\nleast 7 days in the fertilizing sperm cells, and disruption of maternal DNA\ndouble-strand break repair pathways increases sperm cell-derived chromosomal\naberrations.[9] Treatment of male mice with [melphalan](/wiki/Melphalan\n\"Melphalan\"), a bifunctional alkylating agent frequently employed in\nchemotherapy, induces DNA lesions during meiosis that may persist in an\nunrepaired state as germ cells progress though DNA repair-competent phases of\nspermatogenic development.[10] Such unrepaired DNA damages in sperm cells,\nafter fertilization, can lead to offspring with various abnormalities.\n\n### Sperm size\n\nRelated to sperm quality is sperm size, at least in some animals. For\ninstance, the sperm of some species of fruit fly\n(_[Drosophila](/wiki/Drosophila \"Drosophila\")_) are up to 5.8 cm long — about\n20 times as long as the fly itself. Longer sperm cells are better than their\nshorter counterparts at displacing competitors from the female’s seminal\nreceptacle. The benefit to females is that only healthy males carry ‘good’\ngenes that can produce long sperm in sufficient quantities to outcompete their\ncompetitors.[11][12]\n\n### Market for human sperm\n\nFurther information: [Sperm donation](/wiki/Sperm_donation \"Sperm donation\")\n\nSome [sperm banks](/wiki/Sperm_bank \"Sperm bank\") hold up to 170 litres (37\nimp gal; 45 US gal) of sperm.[13]\n\nIn addition to [ejaculation](/wiki/Ejaculation \"Ejaculation\"), it is possible\nto extract sperm through [TESE](/wiki/Testicular_sperm_extraction \"Testicular\nsperm extraction\").\n\nOn the global market, [Denmark](/wiki/Denmark \"Denmark\") has a well-developed\nsystem of human sperm export. This success mainly comes from the reputation of\nDanish sperm donors for being of high [quality](/wiki/Sperm_quality \"Sperm\nquality\")[14] and, in contrast with the law in the other Nordic countries,\ngives donors the choice of being either anonymous or non-anonymous to the\nreceiving couple.[14] Furthermore, Nordic sperm donors tend to be tall and\nhighly educated[15] and have altruistic motives for their donations,[15]\npartly due to the relatively low monetary compensation in Nordic countries.\nMore than 50 countries worldwide are importers of Danish sperm, including\n[Paraguay](/wiki/Paraguay \"Paraguay\"), [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\"),\n[Kenya](/wiki/Kenya \"Kenya\"), and [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong\nKong\").[14] However, the [Food and Drug\nAdministration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration \"Food and Drug\nAdministration\") (FDA) of the US has banned import of any sperm, motivated by\na risk of transmission of [Creutzfeldt–Jakob\ndisease](/wiki/Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob_disease \"Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease\"),\nalthough such a risk is insignificant, since artificial insemination is very\ndifferent from [the route of transmission of Creutzfeldt–Jakob\ndisease](/wiki/Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob_disease#Transmission\n\"Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease\").[16] The prevalence of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease\nfor donors is at most one in a million, and if the donor was a carrier, the\ninfectious proteins would still have to cross the [blood-testis\nbarrier](/wiki/Blood-testis_barrier \"Blood-testis barrier\") to make\ntransmission possible.[16]\n\n### History\n\nSee also: [Homunculus § Homunculus of\nspermists](/wiki/Homunculus#Homunculus_of_spermists \"Homunculus\")\n\nSperm were first observed in 1677 by [Antonie van\nLeeuwenhoek](/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek \"Antonie van Leeuwenhoek\")[17]\nusing a [microscope](/wiki/Microscope \"Microscope\"), he described them as\nbeing [animalcules](/wiki/Animalcule \"Animalcule\") (little animals), probably\ndue to his belief in [preformationism](/wiki/Preformationism\n\"Preformationism\"), which thought that each sperm contained a fully formed but\nsmall human.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Forensic analysis\n\nEjaculated fluids are detected by [ultraviolet light](/wiki/Uv_light \"Uv\nlight\"), irrespective of the structure or colour of the surface.[18] Sperm\nheads, e.g. from vaginal swabs, are still detected by\n[microscopy](/wiki/Microscopy \"Microscopy\") using the \"Christmas Tree Stain\"\nmethod, i.e., Kernechtrot-Picroindigocarmine (KPIC) staining.[19][20]\n\n## Sperm in plants\n\nSperm cells in algal and many plant [gametophytes](/wiki/Gametophyte\n\"Gametophyte\") are produced in male [gametangia](/wiki/Gametangium\n\"Gametangium\") ([antheridia](/wiki/Antheridium \"Antheridium\")) via\n[mitotic](/wiki/Mitosis \"Mitosis\") division. In [flowering\nplants](/wiki/Flowering_plant \"Flowering plant\"), sperm nuclei are produced\ninside [pollen](/wiki/Pollen \"Pollen\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Motile sperm cells\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Plant_sperm.png/220px-\nPlant_sperm.png)](/wiki/File:Plant_sperm.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Plant_sperm.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nMotile sperm cells of algae and seedless plants.[21]\n\nMotile sperm cells typically move via [flagella](/wiki/Flagellum \"Flagellum\")\nand require a water medium in order to swim toward the egg for fertilization.\nIn animals most of the energy for sperm motility is derived from the\nmetabolism of [fructose](/wiki/Fructose \"Fructose\") carried in the [seminal\nfluid](/wiki/Semen \"Semen\"). This takes place in the\n[mitochondria](/wiki/Mitochondria \"Mitochondria\") located in the sperm's\nmidpiece (at the base of the sperm head). These cells cannot swim backwards\ndue to the nature of their propulsion. The uniflagellated sperm cells (with\none flagellum) of [animals](/wiki/Animal \"Animal\") are referred to as\n**[spermatozoa](/wiki/Spermatozoon \"Spermatozoon\")** , and are known to vary\nin size.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nMotile sperm are also produced by many [protists](/wiki/Protist \"Protist\") and\nthe [gametophytes](/wiki/Gametophyte \"Gametophyte\") of\n[bryophytes](/wiki/Bryophyte \"Bryophyte\"), [ferns](/wiki/Fern \"Fern\") and some\n[gymnosperms](/wiki/Gymnosperm \"Gymnosperm\") such as [cycads](/wiki/Cycad\n\"Cycad\") and [ginkgo](/wiki/Ginkgo \"Ginkgo\"). The sperm cells are the only\nflagellated cells in the life cycle of these plants. In many ferns and\n[lycophytes](/wiki/Lycophyte \"Lycophyte\"), they are multi-flagellated\n(carrying more than one flagellum).[21]\n\nIn [nematodes](/wiki/Nematode \"Nematode\"), the sperm cells are\n[amoeboid](/wiki/Amoeboid_movement \"Amoeboid movement\") and crawl, rather than\nswim, towards the egg cell.[22]\n\n## Non-motile sperm cells\n\nNon-motile sperm cells called **spermatia** lack flagella and therefore cannot\nswim. Spermatia are produced in a [spermatangium](/wiki/Gametangium\n\"Gametangium\").[21]\n\nBecause spermatia cannot swim, they depend on their environment to carry them\nto the egg cell. Some [red algae](/wiki/Red_alga \"Red alga\"), such as\n_[Polysiphonia](/wiki/Polysiphonia \"Polysiphonia\")_ , produce non-motile\nspermatia that are spread by water currents after their release.[21] The\nspermatia of [rust fungi](/wiki/Rust_\\(fungus\\) \"Rust \\(fungus\\)\") are covered\nwith a sticky substance. They are produced in flask-shaped structures\ncontaining [nectar](/wiki/Nectar \"Nectar\"), which attract [flies](/wiki/Fly\n\"Fly\") that transfer the spermatia to nearby [hyphae](/wiki/Hyphae \"Hyphae\")\nfor fertilization in a mechanism similar to [insect\npollination](/wiki/Insect_pollination \"Insect pollination\") in [flowering\nplants](/wiki/Flowering_plant \"Flowering plant\").[23]\n\nFungal spermatia (also called pycniospores, especially in the Uredinales) may\nbe confused with [conidia](/wiki/Conidium \"Conidium\"). Conidia are\n[spores](/wiki/Spore \"Spore\") that germinate independently of fertilization,\nwhereas spermatia are [gametes](/wiki/Gamete \"Gamete\") that are required for\nfertilization. In some fungi, such as _[Neurospora\ncrassa](/wiki/Neurospora_crassa \"Neurospora crassa\")_ , spermatia are\nidentical to microconidia as they can perform both functions of fertilization\nas well as giving rise to new organisms without fertilization.[24]\n\n## Sperm nuclei\n\nIn almost all [embryophytes](/wiki/Embryophyte \"Embryophyte\"), including most\ngymnosperms and all [angiosperms](/wiki/Angiosperm \"Angiosperm\"), the male\n[gametophytes](/wiki/Gametophyte \"Gametophyte\") ([pollen grains](/wiki/Pollen\n\"Pollen\")) are the primary mode of [dispersal](/wiki/Biological_dispersal\n\"Biological dispersal\"), for example via wind or insect\n[pollination](/wiki/Pollination \"Pollination\"), eliminating the need for water\nto bridge the gap between male and female. Each pollen grain contains a\nspermatogenous (generative) cell. Once the pollen lands on the\n[stigma](/wiki/Stigma_\\(flower\\) \"Stigma \\(flower\\)\") of a receptive flower,\nit germinates and starts growing a [pollen tube](/wiki/Pollen_tube \"Pollen\ntube\") through the [carpel](/wiki/Carpel \"Carpel\"). Before the tube reaches\nthe [ovule](/wiki/Ovule \"Ovule\"), the nucleus of the generative cell in the\npollen grain divides and gives rise to two sperm nuclei, which are then\ndischarged through the tube into the [ovule](/wiki/Ovule \"Ovule\") for\nfertilization.[21]\n\nIn some [protists](/wiki/Protist \"Protist\"), fertilization also involves sperm\n[nuclei](/wiki/Cell_nucleus \"Cell nucleus\"), rather than cells, migrating\ntoward the egg cell through a fertilization tube. [Oomycetes](/wiki/Oomycete\n\"Oomycete\") form sperm nuclei in a [syncytical](/wiki/Syncytium \"Syncytium\")\n[antheridium](/wiki/Antheridium \"Antheridium\") surrounding the egg cells. The\nsperm nuclei reach the eggs through fertilization tubes, similar to the pollen\ntube mechanism in plants.[21]\n\n## Sperm centrioles\n\nMost sperm cells have [centrioles](/wiki/Centrioles \"Centrioles\") in the sperm\nneck.[25] Sperm of many animals has 2 centrioles known as the proximal\ncentriole and distal centriole. Some animals like human have a single\ncentriole known as the proximal centriole. Mice and rat have no sperm\ncentrioles. The fruit fly [Drosophila\nmelanogaster](/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster \"Drosophila melanogaster\") has a\nsingle centriole and an atypical centriole named the [Proximal Centriole-\nLike](/wiki/Proximal_Centriole-Like \"Proximal Centriole-Like\") (PCL).[26]\n\n## Sperm tail formation\n\nThe sperm tail is a specialized type of [cilium](/wiki/Cilium \"Cilium\") (aka\nflagella). In many animals the sperm tail is formed in a unique way, which is\nnamed [Cytosolic ciliogenesis](/wiki/Cytosolic_ciliogenesis \"Cytosolic\nciliogenesis\"), since all or part of [axoneme](/wiki/Axoneme \"Axoneme\") of the\nsperm tail is formed in the [cytoplasm](/wiki/Cytoplasm \"Cytoplasm\") or get\nexposed to the cytoplasm.[27]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Mendelian inheritance](/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance \"Mendelian inheritance\")\n  * [Ejaculation](/wiki/Ejaculation \"Ejaculation\")\n  * [Female sperm](/wiki/Female_sperm \"Female sperm\")\n  * [Female sperm storage](/wiki/Female_sperm_storage \"Female sperm storage\")\n  * [Polyspermy](/wiki/Polyspermy \"Polyspermy\")\n  * [Sperm competition](/wiki/Sperm_competition \"Sperm competition\")\n  * [Sperm donation](/wiki/Sperm_donation \"Sperm donation\")\n  * [Sperm granuloma](/wiki/Sperm_granuloma \"Sperm granuloma\")\n  * [Spermatogenesis](/wiki/Spermatogenesis \"Spermatogenesis\")\n  * [Spermatozoon](/wiki/Spermatozoon \"Spermatozoon\")\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Ishijima, Sumio; Oshio, Shigeru; Mohri, Hideo (1986). \"_Flagellar movement of human spermatozoa_ \". _Gamete Research_. **13** (3): 185–197.
