The activists, armed with placards and banners, went to sea on seventy\nboats and ships. The posters read: “Do not build a base” and “Stop throwing\ngravel”. Protesters urged the Japanese authorities to stop the expansion of\nthe US military presence on the island. Some of the boats went to the guarded\nconstruction site, where they came across the Coast Guard patrol vessels.

The\ndeployment would be the first of Ospreys in Japan other than in Okinawa, where\nthe US Marines have already deployed their version of the aircraft, known as\nthe MV-22s.[52]\n\nOn 25 April, 2018 two US Air Force Osprey MV-22, deployed at US Marine Corps\nAir Station Futenma on the Okinawa island, made an emergency landing at the\nAmami Airport on the nearby island in Kagoshima Prefecture. US Ospreys have\nexperienced numerous mishaps in recent years, prompting Japanese officials to\ncall for revision of certain provisions of the US-Japan Status of Forces\nAgreement (SOFA), which outlines the rights and privileges of foreign military\npersonnel present in the country.\n[[5]](https://sputniknews.com/asia/201804251063897210-osprey-japan-emergency-\nlanding-japan/)\n\n##\nFacilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Forces_Japan&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit
