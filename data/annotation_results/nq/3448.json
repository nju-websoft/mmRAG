The SIG Sauer P320 can be chambered in\n[9×19mm Parabellum](/wiki/9%C3%9719mm_Parabellum \"9×19mm Parabellum\")\n(referred to here as simply 9mm), [.357 SIG](/wiki/.357_SIG \".357 SIG\"), [.40\nS&W](/wiki/.40_S%26W \".40 S&W\"), and [.45 ACP](/wiki/.45_ACP \".45 ACP\"). The\nhandguns made in 9mm, .357 SIG, and .40 S&W calibers can be easily converted\namong each to be the other. A change from .357 Sig to .40 S&W requires only a\nbarrel change. The change between 9mm to .357 Sig or .40 S&W and vice versa\nare accomplished using a caliber exchange kits.\n\nThe P320 chambered in [9×19mm Parabellumwas](/wiki/9%C3%9719mm_Parabellum\n\"9×19mm Parabellum\") introduced in the North American market on January 15,\n2014 followed by the [.45 ACP](/wiki/.45_ACP \".45 ACP\") compact model at the\n[SHOT Show](/wiki/SHOT_Show \"SHOT Show\") in January 2015.[1] The P320 is a\nfurther development of the [SIG Sauer P250](/wiki/SIG_Sauer_P250 \"SIG Sauer\nP250\") utilizing a [striker-fired](/wiki/Striker-fired \"Striker-fired\")\nmechanism in lieu of a [double action only](/wiki/Double_action_only \"Double\naction only\") [hammer](/wiki/Hammer-fired \"Hammer-fired\") system. On January\n19, 2017, it was announced that a customized version of the SIG Sauer P320 had\nwon the United States Military [XM17 Modular Handgun System\ncompetition](/wiki/XM17_Modular_Handgun_System_competition \"XM17 Modular\nHandgun System competition\"). The full sized model will be known as the M17\nand the carry sized model will be known as the M18.[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Design details\n    * 1.1 Features\n      * 1.1.1 Modular options\n    * 1.2 Recoil mechanism\n    * 1.3 Slide\n    * 1.4 Safety Mechanisms\n    * 1.5 Trigger system\n    * 1.6 Barrel\n    * 1.7 Ammunition feeding\n    * 1.8 Sights\n    * 1.9 Field Stripping\n    * 1.10 Removing the Fire Control Unit\n    * 1.11 Accessories\n  * 2 Variants\n    * 2.1 Modular Handgun System Procurement XM17\n      * 2.1.1 The 101st Airborne are the first to receive the M17\n  * 3 Drop Firing Problem\n  * 4 Voluntary Upgrade Program\n  * 5 Patent Infringement Lawsuit\n  * 6 Users\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Design\ndetails[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Design details\")]\n\n### Features[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Features\")]\n\nA key feature of the pistol is its [modular design](/wiki/Modular_design\n\"Modular design\"). The main module of the P320 is an internal [stainless\nsteel](/wiki/Stainless_steel \"Stainless steel\") frame fire control unit, which\nconsists of the integrated fire control group\n([trigger](/wiki/Trigger_\\(firearms\\) \"Trigger \\(firearms\\)\"), and all\nnecessary linkage and springs), ambidextrous [slide\nrelease](/wiki/Slide_release \"Slide release\") (one on each side of the\npistol), [ejector](/wiki/Ejector_\\(firearms\\) \"Ejector \\(firearms\\)\") and four\nslide rails. This steel receiver unit is used in every P320 grip module, top\nend, and chambering combination and is inserted into the grip frame module and\nheld in place by the axis pin of the disassembly lever. The firearm's serial\nnumber is on the fire control unit instead of the grip module. The fire\ncontrol unit allows the operator to interchange differently-sized slide\nassembly or top end modules and [polymer](/wiki/Polymer \"Polymer\") grip frame\nmodules and trigger shoes and (limited) chambering conversions to adapt the\ngun to the individual user and address different needs.\n\nEach of these three calibers comes in four sizes, which again can all be\nchanged back and forth using caliber exchange kits. A 9mm full size can be\nchanged to a 9mm carry, compact, or subcompact in this manner (as can any of\nthe 3 calibers). Or a 9mm full size can be changed to .357 Sig carry (for\nexample). In addition to the basic P320 models are the RX series which feature\noptical sights built in. Another P320 variation is the X Series. The RX\nfeatures are also available to standard models through caliber exchange kits,\nand vice versa. These parts are not firearms and are not serialized and can be\nsold and shipped with no restriction.\n\nThe Sig Sauer P320 handguns use polymer grip frames which can be changed from\nbetween of four sizes of frames and three sizes of grips. In this manner the\nsize of the grip is matched to the length of the handgun action as well as\nbeing available in three grip sizes. The four chassis sizes are full, carry,\ncompact, and sub compact. The three grip sizes are large, medium, and small.\nThe .45 ACP caliber is not interchangeable with the other calibers but does\nhave varying grip sizes too. Most of the grip sizes have a standard [Picatinny\naccessory rail](/wiki/Picatinny_rail \"Picatinny rail\") , except for subcompact\ngrips.\n\nThe firearms serial number, which is used for registration and tracking by the\ngovernment, is part of the one part that is not changeable with regard to\nregistration and is in effect the firearm regardless of which of the frame or\ngrip sizes is attached to it. The Fire Control Unit (FCU) contains the\ntrigger, striker, disconnector, and safety mechanisms. This is, in effect, the\nfirearm while all the interchangeable barrels, slides, recoil springs, grips,\nand magazines involved are merely accessory pieces and are not subject to\nregistration of restrictions. (USA regulations). The ability to change\ncaliber, frame size, and grip size is the essence of the modular system.\n\nThe P320 was designed to be ambidextrous in handling, sporting an ambidextrous\nslide catch lever and user reversible magazine catch. All other operating\ncontrols are designed so they can be operated from either side. The firearm\ncan be field stripped with no tools. Additionally, the firearm can also be\nfield stripped without depressing the trigger, an additional safety feature to\nprevent [negligent\ndischarge](/wiki/Unintentional_discharge_\\(firearms\\)#Negligent_discharge\n\"Unintentional discharge \\(firearms\\)\") of the weapon.[3]\n\nThe full-size, carry and compact grip modules feature an integral [Picatinny\nrail](/wiki/Picatinny_rail \"Picatinny rail\") mounting-bracket at the lower\nforward edge of the module to allow the mounting of [laser\nsights](/wiki/Laser_applications#Laser_sight \"Laser applications\"), [tactical\nlights](/wiki/Tactical_light \"Tactical light\"), and other accessories.\n\n#### Modular\noptions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Modular options\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/SIG_Sauer_P320_9mm_Pistol.jpg/300px-\nSIG_Sauer_P320_9mm_Pistol.jpg)](/wiki/File:SIG_Sauer_P320_9mm_Pistol.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:SIG_Sauer_P320_9mm_Pistol.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSig Sauer P320 Full Size\n\nThe P320 pistol is offered in three [Glass-filled polymer](/wiki/Glass-\nfilled_polymer \"Glass-filled polymer\") grip module sizes—small, medium, and\nlarge—in each of the full-sized, carry, compact, and subcompact P320 variants.\nThe pistol top ends also come in full-sized, compact, and subcompact variants\nthat will fit the correspondingly sized grip modules. Every chambering can be\nconverted by the user with a caliber exchange kit. The 9×19mm Parabellum, .40\nS&W, and .357 SIG chamberings share their polymer grip frame modules and this\noffers the possibility to interchange these three chamberings by swapping the\ntop end—consisting of the [slide](/wiki/Slide_\\(firearms\\) \"Slide\n\\(firearms\\)\"), recoil spring assembly, [barrel](/wiki/Barrel_\\(firearms\\)\n\"Barrel \\(firearms\\)\") and the [box magazine](/wiki/Box_magazine \"Box\nmagazine\"). Due to the significantly larger external dimensions of the .45 ACP\ncartridge compared to the other P320 chambering options, the .45 ACP\nchambering uses slightly wider .45 ACP–specific polymer grip modules with an\nenlarged magazine well. The firearm's \"fire control group\", which contains the\nonly serialized part of the firearm, is also slightly different to accommodate\nthe enlarged magazine well.\n\nThe manufacturer offers caliber exchange kits or Caliber X-Change® kits\nconsisting of a slide, recoil assembly, barrel, box magazine and grip module\nin the varying frame sizes, grip module sizes and chambering variants in which\nthe P320 pistol is offered. These kits enable a user to switch between the\nvarious P320 configurations without the use of tools.\n\n### Recoil\nmechanism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Recoil mechanism\")]\n\nLike other SIG Sauer pistols, the P320 pistol is a [short\nrecoil](/wiki/Short_recoil \"Short recoil\") operated, locked breech pistol. It\nuses the [Sig Sauer System](/wiki/Sig_Sauer_System \"Sig Sauer System\") cam-\noperated barrel, which locks into the ejection port on the slide.\n\n### Slide[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Slide\")]\n\nThe slide is made of stainless steel and is often finished in a durable black\nfinish called Nitron®. The slide contains the breechblock, striker,\ndisconnector, ejector, and safety systems. State compliant versions may also\nmount an ambidextrous external safety lever. Some slides are machined for the\nRomeo1 type of optical sight.\n\n### Safety\nMechanisms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Safety Mechanisms\")]\n\nThe standard P320 has no [manual safeties](/wiki/Manual_safeties \"Manual\nsafeties\"), promoting instant readiness. The use of an automatic [firing pin\nsafety](/wiki/Firing_pin_safety \"Firing pin safety\") combined with a\ndisconnector ensures safe carrying of the weapon, while preventing accidental\ndischarges if the gun is dropped or roughly handled. As mandated in some USA\nstates, some models come with an external safety. The Modular Handgun System\n(MHS) (now known as the M17) version of the P320 has an ambidextrous thumb\nsafety. Law Enforcement and Military versions can also be equipped with a\ntabbed safety trigger on request.\n\n### Trigger\nsystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Trigger system\")]\n\nThe [trigger](/wiki/Trigger_\\(firearms\\) \"Trigger \\(firearms\\)\") releases a\npretensioned [Double Action](/wiki/Double_Action \"Double Action\") striker. The\ntrigger system has a pull weight of about 5.5 [lbs.](/wiki/Pound-force \"Pound-\nforce\"), 28.95 [N](/wiki/Newton_\\(unit\\) \"Newton \\(unit\\)\") [4]\n\nThe P320 trigger is available in standard (solid) and tabbed (with trigger\nsafety).[5]\n\n### Barrel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Barrel\")]\n\nThe P320 is available with a 120 mm (4.7 in), 98 mm (3.9 in), or 91 mm (3.6\nin) barrel depending on the size (full-sized, carry/compact or sub-compact\nrespectively). The Tacops model barrel is threaded for [suppressor (also\ncalled a silencer)](/wiki/Suppressor \"Suppressor\") use.\n\nModel Size | Barrel Length | Threaded  \n---|---|---  \nX-Five | 5 |   \nFull | 4.7 |   \nCarry | 3.9 | 4.6  \nCompact | 3.9 |   \nSubcompact | 3.6 |   \n  \n### Ammunition\nfeeding[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Ammunition feeding\")]\n\nThe pistol feeds from metal detachable box magazines with a 6 to 21 round\nmagazine capacity, depending on chambering and pistol size. See the chart\nunder the Variants section.\n\n### Sights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Sights\")]\n\nThe P320 comes with three-dot combat-type [iron\nsights](/wiki/Iron_sights#Contrast_enhancements \"Iron sights\") of which the\nfront sight element can be drifted to the left or right in its dovetail to\nadjust for windage. There are three rear sight heights and six front sight\nheights available to adjust for elevation. Self-luminous\n[tritium](/wiki/Tritium \"Tritium\")-powered SIGLITE [Night\nSights](/wiki/Iron_sights#Contrast_enhancements \"Iron sights\") in differing\nheights are optional. SIGLITE night sights are optional, but come standard in\nexchange kits.\n\nThe SIG Sauer Romeo1 sight is supplied on the RX Full and RX Compact versions\nof the P320. [6]\n\nThe X-Five comes with Dawson Precision Fiber Optic front sight and a fully\nadjustable rear sight. [7]\n\n### Field\nStripping[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Field Stripping\")]\n\nField stripping is accomplished by first locking the action open with the hold\nopen lever either by racking the slide to the rear with an empty magazine\nwhich will engage the slide hold open lever when the slide is released, or by\nholding the slide to the rear and then pushing up the slide hold open lever.\nThe magazine is then removed. Then the takedown lever on the left side of the\nframe is revolved downward. The slide hold open lever is then pushed down\nwhile holding onto the slide assembly which can then be removed from it's\nengagement with the fire control units stainless steel rails. Once removed the\nbarrel can be removed from the slide by pushing the recoil spring, located\nunder the barrel away from the breech block which allows the spring to be\nremoved. Then the barrel can be pivoted downward away from the slide breech\nend first and then removed from the front of the slid bushing. Cleaning can be\neasily accomplished from this point on.\n\nReassembly requires that the slide be locked open with the slide hold open\nlever (and then released or left open) or the magazine cannot be reinserted.\n\n### Removing the Fire Control\nUnit[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Removing the Fire Control Unit\")]\n\nChanging grip modules is very easy and simple. It begins with the removal of\nthe slide as noted above. Once the slide assembly is removed the takedown\nlever can be removed from the frame by pulling it out from the left side. Then\nthe Fire Control Unit (FCU) can be pivoted out of the grip. The FCU can then\nbe easily inserted into a different grip size and if desired a different slide\nassembly can be used with that different frame. This is the essence of the\nconfigurability of the modular system.\n\n###\nAccessories[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Accessories\")]\n\nThe factory accessories consist of magazines, caliber exchange kits, barrels,\n[handgun holsters](/wiki/Handgun_holster \"Handgun holster\"), Optical Sights,\nand Tactical Light/Laser units.\n\n## Variants[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Variants\")]\n\nIn the chart below the presence of **MS** in the model indicates a model with\n**manual external ambidextrous safety**.

(This is the slide from the RX Series) [9]\n  * Ambidextrous thumb safety\n  * [Loaded chamber indicator](/wiki/Loaded_chamber_indicator \"Loaded chamber indicator\")\n  * Improved slide sub-assembly to capture small components when disassembled\n  * Improved trigger \"mud flap\" to prevent foreign debris from entering the pistol action\n  * 4.7\" 120 mm barrel length in full size M17\n  * 3.9\" 98 mm barrel length in compact M18\n  * chambered in [9×19mm Parabellum](/wiki/9%C3%9719mm_Parabellum \"9×19mm Parabellum\")(can be adapted to fire larger calibers like [.357 SIG](/wiki/.357_SIG \".357 SIG\") and [.40 S&W](/wiki/.40_S%26W \".40 S&W\"))\n  * Pistols chambered in 9mm can feature a 17-round magazine in standard with optional 21-round extended magazines available.[10][11]\n\n#### The 101st Airborne are the first to receive the\nM17[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit\nsection: The 101st Airborne are the first to receive the M17\")]\n\nOn January 19, 2017, it was announced that the SIG Sauer P320 MHS variant had\nwon the United States Military's Modular Handgun System trials. The P320 will\nbe known as the **M17** (full size) and **M18** (compact) in U.S. Military\nservice. Though the pistol will remain chambered in [9 x 19mm\nParabellum](/wiki/9_x_19mm_Parabellum \"9 x 19mm Parabellum\") rather than a\nlarger caliber, the contract allows the Army and other services to procure Sig\nSauer’s proposed XM1152 Full Metal Jacket and XM1153 Special Purpose\nammunition.[12][13] The ammunition chosen to go with the pistol is a\n\"Winchester jacketed hollow point\" round.\n\nIn May 2017, the Army announced that the first unit that will receive the M17\nwould be the [101st Airborne Division](/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division \"101st\nAirborne Division\") by the end of the year. At the same time, the rest of the\nU.S. Armed Forces revealed they also intend to acquire the handgun, making it\nthe standard sidearm for the entire U.S. military. The services plan to\nprocure up to 421,000 weapons in total; 195,000 for the Army, 130,000 for the\n[Air Force](/wiki/USAF \"USAF\"), 61,000 for the [Navy](/wiki/U.S._Navy \"U.S.\nNavy\") (XM18 compact version only), and 35,000 for the\n[Marines](/wiki/U.S._Marine_Corps \"U.S. Marine Corps\").[14][15]\n\nOn 17 November 2017, soldiers of the 101st Airborne received the first XM17\nand XM18 pistols, with over 2,000 handguns delivered. The XM17 has better\naccuracy and ergonomics and tighter dispersion than the M9. It will also be\nfielded more widely, being issued down to [squad](/wiki/Squad \"Squad\") and\n[fireteam](/wiki/Fireteam \"Fireteam\") leaders; while special forces would\ndual-arm all of its members with a pistol and rifle, previously junior leaders\nin regular infantry units were excluded from carrying sidearms but policy was\nchanged to give them more choices and options in close quarters battle\nsituations. All Army units are planned to have the M9 replaced with the M17\nwithin a decade.[16][17]\n\n## Drop Firing\nProblem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: Drop Firing Problem\")]\n\nIn late July 2017, the Dallas Police Department instructed all personnel to\nstop carrying the P320 pending an investigation.[18] There are concerns that\nthe firearm may discharge when it is dropped and the back of the slide hits\nthe ground at about a 30-degree angle. The problem may be related to the\ntrigger weight; some triggers are heavy enough that they essentially continue\nto move due to inertia after the gun hits the ground. Internet publications,\nsuch as TheTruthAboutGuns.com, conducted independent tests that appear to\nconfirm potential drop firings (at a 40% rate).[19] Another test has shown\nthat the P320 may discharge when the magazine hits the ground first after the\ngun is dropped.[20]\n\nOn 8 August 2017, Sig Sauer issued a notice that they would upgrade all P320s\nto address the issue.[21] The P320 upgrade program is detailed on the Sig\nSauer Website at: [P320 Voluntary Upgrade\nProgram](https://www.sigsauer.com/support/p320-voluntary-upgrade/).\n\n## Voluntary Upgrade\nProgram[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit\nsection: Voluntary Upgrade Program\")]\n\nAlthough the P320 handgun had successfully passed the MH17 drop protocol tests\nit became apparent later than the gun could fire if dropped in a specific\nfashion onto a hard surface. In one instance a gun writer installed a lighter\ntrigger which almost totally eliminated the possibility of accidentally\nfiring. Sig Sauer instituted a program for those who wanted to upgrade their\nP320 handguns whereby a number of changes are made which ensure that no drop\ndischarges are likely to occur. The details of the changes are found here:\n[Explanation of Changes Made To The P320\nPistol](https://www.sigsauer.com/support/p320-voluntary-upgrade/#FAQ)\n\nThe upgrade program entails no cost to the owner. Sig Sauer sends a \"call tag\"\nto the owner who ships the firearm at no cost by 2 day freight to Sig's\nfactory for the upgrade. After the upgrade is performed the handgun is shipped\nback to the owner, again by 2 day freight. To participate in the upgrade\nprogram a user goes to the Sig Sauer website as shown above and registers for\nthe upgrade. Sig Sauer will send to the user a prepaid shipping label and\ninstruction on how to pack the firearm for legal shipment. Details will\ngenerally be sent by email, or post if the owner does not have email. Once the\nfirearm arrives at Sig Sauer the announced wait time is from four to six\nweeks. Actual turnaround time has been as short as 7 days. Once shipped the\nowner will be notified of the shipment and given a tracking number. [SIG SAUER\nAnnounces Details of Free P320 ‘Voluntary Upgrade’\nProgram](http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2017/08/daniel-zimmerman/sig-sauer-\nannounces-details-p320-voluntary-upgrade-program/)\n\nOwners who have received their P320s back after the upgrade report that they\nare also being given a Sig P320 Patch and a 25% discount coupon for a future\npurchase from the Sig Sauer store.\n\n## Patent Infringement\nLawsuit[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: Patent Infringement Lawsuit\")]\n\nIn May 2017, [Steyr Mannlicher](/wiki/Steyr_Mannlicher \"Steyr Mannlicher\")\nfiled a patent infringement lawsuit against Sig Sauer[22]. Steyr references\ntheir patent US6260301 (filed in 1999 and approved in 2001), which is for a\nhandgun with a removable chassis. Steyr Arms is demanding a preliminary and\npermanent injunction against Sig Sauer selling any of these firearms.\n\n## Users[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit\nsection: Users\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Flag_of_Thailand.svg/23px-Flag_of_Thailand.svg.png) [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand \"Thailand\"): [Royal Thai Police](/wiki/Royal_Thai_Police \"Royal Thai Police\"); Purchase of 152,468 SIG Sauer P320 pistols is approved.[23][24] The pistols were delivered in December 2017.[25]\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png) [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"): \n    * [United States Army](/wiki/United_States_Army \"United States Army\"): On January 19th, 2017, the P320 was chosen to replace the [Beretta M9](/wiki/Beretta_M9 \"Beretta M9\") as its main service pistol in response to the request for a Modular Handgun System (MHS) also known as XM17.[26][27]\n    * [Hawaii Department of Public Safety](/wiki/Hawaii_Department_of_Public_Safety \"Hawaii Department of Public Safety\")[28]\n    * [Oklahoma Highway Patrol](/wiki/Oklahoma_Highway_Patrol \"Oklahoma Highway Patrol\")[29]\n    * [Pasco County Sheriff's Office](/wiki/Pasco_County_Sheriff%27s_Office \"Pasco County Sheriff's Office\") (Florida)[30]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SIG_Sauer_P320&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"SHOT Show 2015: SIG SAUER adds subcompact and .45-Caliber options to P320 family\"](http://www.miltechmag.com/2015/01/shot-show-2015-sig-sauer-adds.html). _miltechmag.com_.
