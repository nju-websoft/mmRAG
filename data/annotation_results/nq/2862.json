When they realize their ideas collide, they use the money\nto try to reunite the entire family for Christmas by paying for airline\ntickets for their children, grandchildren and their in-laws. Mike and Carol\nare also thinking of selling the house to buy a smaller [condo](/wiki/Condo\n\"Condo\") as they are now empty nesters who no longer need such a large home.\n\nHowever, all of the Brady kids are facing personal obstacles that might keep\nthem from enjoying the festivities: Greg's wife Nora is spending Christmas\nwith her family; Peter is romantically involved with his boss Valerie and his\ninferior position and salary is affecting his self-confidence; Bobby has\ndropped out of college to become a race car driver but has not revealed this\nto his parents; Marcia's husband Wally was fired from his job at a toy\ncompany; Jan is separating from her husband Philip and Cindy is fighting for\nher independence since she is the youngest and still gets treated like the\nbaby of the family. Cindy is currently a college undergraduate and in an issue\nsimilar to Bobby's, Cindy lies to her parents about overwhelming college\nstudent issues, when in actuality she plans to go skiing in\n[Aspen](/wiki/Aspen \"Aspen\") with her roommates.\n\nEven their former housekeeper Alice is dealing with a serious issue: her\nhusband Sam has recently left her for another woman. Through each child\ndeciding to spend the holiday and eventually opening up about their issues,\nMike and Carol are able to help them out. Nora arrives to surprise Greg.\nHowever, the family's Christmas dinner is disrupted when Mike learns that a\nruthless businessman he designed a building for has cut corners, resulting in\nthe building collapsing and trapping two security guards inside. Mike manages\nto free the trapped employees, but an [aftershock](/wiki/Aftershock\n\"Aftershock\") results in Mike getting trapped in rubble himself.\n\nIn the end, Mike gets out of the debris after Carol and the entire family\nsings \"[O Come All Ye Faithful](/wiki/O_Come_All_Ye_Faithful \"O Come All Ye\nFaithful\")\" (a nod to Carol singing it in the original series' episode \"The\nVoice of Christmas\"). After returning home, the family's dinner is again\ninterrupted, this time by a man at the door dressed as [Santa\nClaus](/wiki/Santa_Claus \"Santa Claus\"). The kids ask where his bag of\npresents is, but he tells them that he only has one present, for Alice; it\nturns out to be Sam, in disguise, who has seen the error of his ways and\npleads for Alice's forgiveness. After she takes Sam back, the family invites\nhim to stay for dinner, and the film ends with everyone singing a chorus of\n\"[We Wish You a Merry Christmas](/wiki/We_Wish_You_a_Merry_Christmas \"We Wish\nYou a Merry Christmas\")\".\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Very_Brady_Christmas&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Robert Reed](/wiki/Robert_Reed \"Robert Reed\") as [Mike Brady](/wiki/List_of_The_Brady_Bunch_characters#Mike_Brady \"List of The Brady Bunch characters\")\n  * [Florence Henderson](/wiki/Florence_Henderson \"Florence Henderson\") as [Carol Brady](/wiki/List_of_The_Brady_Bunch_characters#Carol_Brady \"List of The Brady Bunch characters\")\n  * [Ann B.

A second sequel, _[The Brady Bunch in the White\nHouse](/wiki/The_Brady_Bunch_in_the_White_House \"The Brady Bunch in the White\nHouse\")_ , aired as a [made-for-television film](/wiki/Television_film\n\"Television film\") on [Fox](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting\nCompany\") in 2002.[7]\n\n## Video\nrelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Very_Brady_Christmas&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Video release\")]\n\n_A Very Brady Christmas_ was released on [VHS](/wiki/VHS \"VHS\") by [Paramount\nHome Video](/wiki/Paramount_Home_Media_Distribution \"Paramount Home Media\nDistribution\") in 1993 and has long been out of print.
