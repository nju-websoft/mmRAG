\nThe **Epistle of Paul to the Philippians** , often referred to simply as\n**Philippians** , is the eleventh book in the [New\nTestament](/wiki/New_Testament \"New Testament\"). [Paul](/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle\n\"Paul the Apostle\") and [Timothy](/wiki/Saint_Timothy \"Saint Timothy\") first\nvisited [Philippi](/wiki/Philippi \"Philippi\") in\n[Greece](/wiki/Early_centers_of_Christianity#Greece \"Early centers of\nChristianity\") during Paul's second [missionary\njourney](/wiki/Missionary_journeys_of_Paul \"Missionary journeys of Paul\"),\nwhich occurred between approximately 49 and 51 AD. Philippi was the location\nof the first [Christian community](/wiki/Early_Christian_churches \"Early\nChristian churches\") established in Europe.\n\nBiblical scholars are in general agreement that the letter was indeed written\nby Paul of Tarsus. The estimated date of the letter is 62 AD, about 10 years\nafter Paul's first visit to Philippi.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Historical background\n  * 2 Authorship\n  * 3 Outline\n  * 4 Composition\n  * 5 Christology\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 Notes\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 Further reading\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Historical\nbackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Epistle_to_the_Philippians&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Historical background\")]\n\nThe historical background of Philippians is traditionally gathered from two\nmain primary New Testament sources: informative internal data from the letter\nitself, and related information garnered from the rest of the [New Testament\nCanon](/wiki/New_Testament_Canon \"New Testament Canon\"), especially from the\n[Acts of the Apostles](/wiki/Acts_of_the_Apostles \"Acts of the Apostles\") and\nthe other [Pauline Epistles](/wiki/Pauline_Epistles \"Pauline Epistles\").[2]\nOther primary information is also derived from external historical sources\nrelated to the chronological connections between Paul's association with\nPhilippi, its political and economical setting, and its social and religio-\nphilosophical context.[3]\n\nAccording to the document itself, the Philippians had sent\n[Epaphroditus](/wiki/Epaphroditus \"Epaphroditus\"), their envoy (\"messenger\n[_apostolon_] and minister [_leitourgon_]\" Phil 2:25), with contributions as\nan expression of their \"partnership\" and \"concern\" to meet the needs of Paul\n([Phil\n1:3–5](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#1:3\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\"), [Phil\n2:30](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#2:30\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\"), and [Phil\n4:10–19](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#4:10\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\")).\n\nDuring the execution of his responsibilities of travel to deliver their \"gift\"\n([Phil\n4:17](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#4:17\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\")), Epaphroditus contracted some life-\nthreatening debilitating illness (_esthenese_ , cf. [Phil\n2:26–27](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#2:26\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\")). At some point he recovers. It is at\nthis time, whether premeditated or due to an extended stay with the apostle,\nvarious internal matters are revealed to Paul on the part of Epaphroditus\n([Phil\n1:27–30](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#1:27\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\"), [Phil\n2:19–24](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#2:19\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\"), [Phil\n3:2–3](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#3:2\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\"), [Phil\n3:17–20](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#3:17\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\"), [Phil\n4:2–3](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#4:2\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\"), and [Phil\n4:9](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Philippians#4:9\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Philippians\")).\n\nUpon Epaphroditus' return to health, Paul sends word to the Philippians\nthrough Epaphroditus of his upcoming sentence in Rome and of his optimism in\nthe face of death (1:18b–26), along with exhortations to imitate his capacity\nto rejoice in the Lord despite one's circumstances (2:14–18). Moreover, Paul\nsends counsel regarding spiritual adversaries among the Philippians (3:1–21),\nand conflicts within their fellowship (4:2–3). Lastly, he provides receipt of\nboth Epaphroditus' heroism (2:25–30) and the arrival of \"the gift\" (4:10),\nalong with his promise of a divine accounting (4:17–20).\n\nWithin the letter is also found an optimism where Paul's belief of his release\nis the basis upon which he promises to send Timothy to them for ministry\n(3:19–23), and an anticipation to also pay them a personal visit (2:24). With\nthis communication Epaphroditus sets out on his homeward journey (2:28–29).\n\nThere has been ongoing debate regarding where Paul was when he wrote this\nletter (and therefore the date of the letter's composition). Internal evidence\nin the letter itself points clearly to it being composed while Paul was in\ncustody (Philippians 1:7,13), but which period of imprisonment is highly\ndebated. Some suggest the Roman imprisonment at the end of the Book of Acts\n(chapter 28:30,31). Others suggest the earlier\n[Caesarean](/wiki/Caesarea_Maritima \"Caesarea Maritima\") imprisonment (Acts\n23–26). Still others suggest an earlier imprisonment again, and postulate an\n[Ephesian](/wiki/Ephesus \"Ephesus\") imprisonment during Paul's lengthy stay in\nthat city (Acts 19). Until recently no one seems to have advocated the second\nperiod of Roman imprisonment (after the end of the book of Acts, but attested\nto in the writings of [early church fathers](/wiki/Early_Church_Fathers \"Early\nChurch Fathers\")).[4] Jim Reiher considered and speculated on this theory in a\n2012 article.[5] The main reasons suggested for a later date, include:\n\n  1. The letter's highly developed [Ecclesiology](/wiki/Ecclesiology \"Ecclesiology\")\n  2. An impending sense of death permeating the letter\n  3. The absence of any mention of [Luke](/wiki/Luke_the_Evangelist \"Luke the Evangelist\") in a letter to Luke’s home church (when the narrative in Acts clearly suggests that Luke was with Paul in his first Roman imprisonment)\n  4. A harsher imprisonment than the [open house arrest](/wiki/House_arrest \"House arrest\") of his first Roman imprisonment\n  5. A similar unique expression that is shared only with [2 Timothy](/wiki/2_Timothy \"2 Timothy\")[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n  6. A similar disappointment with co-workers shared only with 2 Timothy.\n\nThis second Roman imprisonment theory is still to be rigorously debated in the\nwider theological community.\n\n##\nAuthorship[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Epistle_to_the_Philippians&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Authorship\")]\n\nThe letter begins in standard form for an ancient Hellenistic letter\nstructure, with author – or senders – first, then recipients with a greeting\n(Phil. 1.1–2).[6]\n\nThe address and the greeting is clear:\n\n    \"Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.

Being found in appearance as a man,\n> He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on\n> a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him\n> the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee\n> will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and\n> that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of\n> God the Father.\n\nThe letter was written to the church at [Philippi](/wiki/Philippi \"Philippi\"),\none of the earliest churches to be founded in [Europe](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\").\nThey were very attached to Paul, just as he was very fond of them. Of all the\nchurches, their contributions (which Paul gratefully acknowledges) are among\nthe only ones he accepts. ([Acts 20:33–35](/wiki/Acts_of_the_Apostles \"Acts of\nthe Apostles\"); [2 Cor. 11:7–12](/wiki/2_Corinthians \"2 Corinthians\"); [2\nThess. 3:8](/wiki/2_Thessalonians \"2 Thessalonians\")). The generosity of the\nPhilippians comes out very conspicuously (Phil. 4:15). \"This was a\ncharacteristic of the [Macedonian](/wiki/Macedonia_\\(region\\) \"Macedonia\n\\(region\\)\") missions, as 2 Cor. 8 and 9 amply and beautifully prove. It is\nremarkable that the Macedonian converts were, as a class, very poor (2 Cor.\n8:2), though the very first converts were of all classes (Acts 16); and the\nparallel facts, their poverty and their open-handed support of the great\nmissionary and his work, are deeply harmonious.\" (Moule).\n\nAs with all epistles, the original was composed in Greek.[9]\n\n##\nChristology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Epistle_to_the_Philippians&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Christology\")]\n\nPhilippians has been the subject of much research and [Ralph P.\nMartin](/wiki/Ralph_P._Martin \"Ralph P. Martin\") argues that Philippians 2 may\nbe considered the beginning of the field of [Christology](/wiki/Christology\n\"Christology\"), specifically referring to the rich analysis that Apostle Paul\nbegan in [Philippians 2:5–6](http://www.biblica.com/en-us/bible/online-\nbible/?osis=niv:Philippians.2:5–6:5).[10] Veronica Koperski views [Philippians\n3:10](http://www.biblica.com/en-us/bible/online-\nbible/?osis=niv:Philippians.3:10–3:10) as the beginning of the analysis of the\n[knowledge of Christ](/wiki/Knowledge_of_Christ \"Knowledge of Christ\").[11]\n\nWhile Paul's opening prayer is for love (1:9), based on [knowledge of\nChrist](/wiki/Knowledge_of_Christ \"Knowledge of Christ\"), his final prayer is\nfor the peace of God (4:7), which surpasses all understanding. Thus the\nconcepts of love, knowledge and peace are jointly developed in the\nEpistle.[12]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Epistle_to_the_Philippians&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Textual variants in the Epistle to the Philippians](/wiki/Textual_variants_in_the_New_Testament#Epistle_to_the_Philippians \"Textual variants in the New Testament\")\n  * _[Cupio dissolvi](/wiki/Cupio_dissolvi \"Cupio dissolvi\")_\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Epistle_to_the_Philippians&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Harris, Stephen L.](/wiki/Stephen_L_Harris \"Stephen L Harris\"), Understanding the Bible.
