Two years later, the [AFL](/wiki/American_Football_League \"American\nFootball League\") held another exhibition, this time with the [New York\nJets](/wiki/New_York_Jets \"New York Jets\") taking on the [San Diego\nChargers](/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers \"San Diego Chargers\").\n\nIn 1965, after the [Atlanta–Fulton County\nStadium](/wiki/Atlanta%E2%80%93Fulton_County_Stadium \"Atlanta–Fulton County\nStadium\") (then known simply as Atlanta Stadium) was built, the city of\nAtlanta felt the time was right to start pursuing professional football. One\nindependent group which had been active in NFL exhibition promotions in\nAtlanta applied for franchises in both the [American Football\nLeague](/wiki/American_Football_League \"American Football League\") and the\n[National Football League](/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football\nLeague\"), acting entirely on its own with no guarantee of stadium rights.\nAnother group reported it had deposited earnest money for a team in the\nAFL.[5]\n\nWith everyone running in different directions, some local businessmen worked\nout a deal and were awarded an AFL franchise on June 7, 1965, contingent upon\nacquiring exclusive stadium rights from city officials. NFL Commissioner Pete\nRozelle, who had been moving slowly in Atlanta matters, was spurred by the AFL\ninterest and headed on the next plane down to Atlanta to block the rival\nleague's claim on the city of Atlanta.[2] He forced the city to make a choice\nbetween the two leagues. By June 30, the city picked Rankin Smith and the NFL.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons franchise began on June 30, 1965, when [NFL\nCommissioner](/wiki/NFL_Commissioner \"NFL Commissioner\") [Pete\nRozelle](/wiki/Pete_Rozelle \"Pete Rozelle\") granted ownership to 41-year-old\n[Rankin Smith Sr.](/wiki/Rankin_Smith_Sr. \"Rankin Smith Sr.\") Smith, an\nExecutive Vice President of Life Insurance Company of Georgia at the time,\npaid $8.5 million the highest price in NFL history at the time for a\nfranchise.[2] Former commissioner Pete Rozelle and Smith made the deal in\nabout five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most\npopular sport to the city of Atlanta. The Atlanta expansion franchise became\nthe 15th NFL franchise, and they were awarded the first pick in the [1966 NFL\ndraft](/wiki/1966_NFL_draft \"1966 NFL draft\") as well as the final pick in\neach of the first five rounds.[6] The Falcons drafted [All-\nAmerican](/wiki/All-American \"All-American\") [linebacker](/wiki/Linebacker\n\"Linebacker\") [Tommy Nobis](/wiki/Tommy_Nobis \"Tommy Nobis\") from the\n[University of Texas](/wiki/Texas_Longhorns_football \"Texas Longhorns\nfootball\") with the first pick of the [draft](/wiki/1966_NFL_draft \"1966 NFL\ndraft\"), making him the first-ever Falcon. The\n[league](/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\") also held\nthe [1966 NFL Expansion Draft](/wiki/1966_NFL_Expansion_Draft \"1966 NFL\nExpansion Draft\") six weeks later in which the Falcons selected unprotected\nplayers from existing franchises. Although the Falcons selected many good\nplayers in those drafts, they still were not able to win right away.[2]\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons Football Club received its nickname on August 29, 1965.\nMiss Julia Elliott, a school teacher from [Griffin,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Griffin,_Georgia \"Griffin, Georgia\"), was singled out from many\npeople who suggested \"Falcons\" as the nickname for the new franchise. Elliott\nwrote: \"the Falcon is proud and dignified, with great courage and fight. It\nnever drops its prey. It is deadly and has a great sporting tradition.\"[7][8]\n\n### 1966–1977: Early\nstruggles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Falcons&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 1966–1977: Early struggles\")]\n\nThe Falcons had their first season in [1966](/wiki/1966_NFL_season \"1966 NFL\nseason\"), and their first preseason game on August 1, 1966, losing to the\n[Philadelphia Eagles](/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles \"Philadelphia Eagles\").
