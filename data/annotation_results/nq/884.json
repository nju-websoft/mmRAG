government\n\nInstitutions of governance – the Parliament, the President, the Judiciary, the\nExecutive, etc. get their power from the Constitution and are bound by it.[40]\nWith the aid of the Constitution, India is governed by a [parliamentary\nsystem](/wiki/Parliamentary_system \"Parliamentary system\") of government with\nthe [executive](/wiki/Executive_\\(government\\) \"Executive \\(government\\)\")\ndirectly accountable to the [legislature](/wiki/Legislature \"Legislature\"). It\nstates that there shall be a [President of India](/wiki/President_of_India\n\"President of India\") who shall be the head of the executive, under Articles\n52 and 53. The President's duty is to preserve, protect and defend the\nconstitution and the law under [Article\n60](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V\n\"s:Constitution of India/Part V\") of the Indian constitution. [Article\n74](/wiki/Article_74_\\(Constitution_of_India\\) \"Article 74 \\(Constitution of\nIndia\\)\") provides that there shall be a [Prime\nMinister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India \"Prime Minister of India\") as the head\nof [union cabinet](/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_of_India \"Council of Ministers\nof India\") which would aid and advise the President in performing his\nconstitutional duty. Union cabinet is collectively responsible to the [House\nof the People](/wiki/Lok_Sabha \"Lok Sabha\") per Article 75(3).\n\nThe Constitution of India is [federal](/wiki/Federalism \"Federalism\") in\nnature but [unitary](/wiki/Unitary_state \"Unitary state\") in spirit. The\ncommon features of a federation such as written\n[Constitution](/wiki/Constitution \"Constitution\"), supremacy of Constitution,\nrigidity of Constitution, two government, [division of\npowers](/wiki/Separation_of_powers \"Separation of powers\"),\n[bicameralism](/wiki/Bicameralism \"Bicameralism\") and independent\n[judiciary](/wiki/Judiciary_of_India \"Judiciary of India\") as well as unitary\nfeatures like single Constitution, single\n[citizenship](/wiki/Indian_nationality_law \"Indian nationality law\"),\nintegrated judiciary, flexible Constitution, a strong\n[Centre](/wiki/Government_of_India \"Government of India\"), appointment of\n[state governor](/wiki/Governors_of_states_of_India \"Governors of states of\nIndia\") by the Centre, [All-India Services](/wiki/All_India_Services \"All\nIndia Services\"), [Emergency\nProvisions](/wiki/Emergency_provisions_of_the_Constitution_of_India \"Emergency\nprovisions of the Constitution of India\") etc. can be seen in Indian\nConstitution. This unique combination makes it quasi-federal in form.[41]\n\nEach state and each [Union territory](/wiki/Union_territory \"Union territory\")\nof India has its own government. Analogous to President and Prime Minister,\neach has a [Governor](/wiki/Governors_of_states_of_India \"Governors of states\nof India\") (in case of states) or [Lieutenant\nGovernor](/wiki/Lieutenant_governor \"Lieutenant governor\") (in the case of\nUnion territories) and a [Chief Minister](/wiki/Chief_Minister_\\(India\\)\n\"Chief Minister \\(India\\)\"). [Article\n356](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_XVIII\n\"s:Constitution of India/Part XVIII\") permits the President to dismiss a state\ngovernment and assume direct authority when a situation has arisen in which\nthe Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Constitution. This power, known as [President's\nrule](/wiki/President%27s_rule \"President's rule\"), was abused earlier as\nstate governments came to be dismissed on the flimsiest of grounds, and more\ndue to the political discomfiture of the party in power at the centre. Post –\n[_Bommai_ judgment](/wiki/S._R._Bommai_v._Union_of_India \"S. R. Bommai v.\nUnion of India\"),[42][43] such a course of action has been rendered rather\ndifficult, as the courts have asserted their right to review it.[44]\nConsequently, very few state governments have been disbanded since.\n\nThe 73rd and 74th Amendment Act also introduced the system of [Panchayati\nRaj](/wiki/Panchayati_raj \"Panchayati raj\") in rural areas and\n[Municipality](/wiki/Nagar_Palika \"Nagar Palika\") in urban areas. Also,\n[Article 370](/wiki/Article_370 \"Article 370\") of the Constitution gives\nspecial status to the State of [Jammu and Kashmir](/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir\n\"Jammu and Kashmir\").\n\n## The constitution and the legislature\n\nMain article: [Amendment of the Constitution of\nIndia](/wiki/Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India \"Amendment of the\nConstitution of India\")\n\nSee also: [List of amendments of the Constitution of\nIndia](/wiki/List_of_amendments_of_the_Constitution_of_India \"List of\namendments of the Constitution of India\")\n\n### Amendment\n\nThe process of addition, variation or repeal of any part of the constitution\nby the parliament under its constituent powers, is called amendment of the\nconstitution.[45] The procedure is laid out in [Article\n368](/wiki/Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India \"Amendment of the\nConstitution of India\"). An amendment bill must be passed by each House of the\nParliament by a majority of the total membership of that House when at least\ntwo-thirds members are present and voted. In addition to this, certain\namendments which pertain to the federal nature of the Constitution must be\nratified by a majority of state legislatures. Unlike the ordinary bills under\nlegislative powers of Parliament as per [Article\n245](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_XI\n\"s:Constitution of India/Part XI\") (with exception to money bills), there is\nno provision for joint sitting of the two houses ([Lok Sabha](/wiki/Lok_Sabha\n\"Lok Sabha\") and [Rajya Sabha](/wiki/Rajya_Sabha \"Rajya Sabha\")) of the\nparliament to pass a constitutional amendment bill. During recess of\nParliament, President can not promulgate ordinances under his legislative\npowers per [Article 123, Chapter\nIII](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V\n\"s:Constitution of India/Part V\") which needs constitutional amendment.\n[Deemed amendments to the\nconstitution](/wiki/Part_I_of_the_Constitution_of_India#Article_4 \"Part I of\nthe Constitution of India\") which can be passed under legislative powers of\nParliament, are no more valid after the addition of [Article 368\n(1)](/wiki/Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India \"Amendment of the\nConstitution of India\") by [Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of\nIndia](/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India \"Twenty-\nfourth Amendment of the Constitution of India\").[45]\n\nAs of September\n2015[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_India&action=edit),\nthere have been 120 amendment bills presented in the parliament, out of which\n100 have been passed to become Amendment Acts.[46] Despite the supermajority\nrequirement for amendments to pass, the Constitution of India is the most\nfrequently amended national governing document in the world.[47] The\nConstitution is so specific in spelling out government powers that many of\nthese amendments address issues dealt with by ordinary statute in other\ndemocracies. As a result, the document is amended roughly twice a year, and\nthree times every two years.\n\nIn 2000, the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution\n(NCRWC) was set up to look into updating the constitution.[48] Government of\nIndia, establishes term based [law commissions](/wiki/Law_Commission_of_India\n\"Law Commission of India\") to recommend law reforms for maximising justice in\nsociety and for promoting good governance under the rule of law.\n\n### Limitations\n\nMain article: [Basic structure doctrine](/wiki/Basic_structure_doctrine \"Basic\nstructure doctrine\")\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled in [Kesavananda Bharati v. State of\nKerala](/wiki/Kesavananda_Bharati_v._State_of_Kerala \"Kesavananda Bharati v.\nState of Kerala\") case that an amendment cannot destroy what it seeks to\nmodify, which means, while amending anything in the Constitution, it cannot\ntinker with the \"[basic structure](/wiki/Basic_structure \"Basic structure\")\"\nor its framework, which is immutable. Such an amendment will be declared\ninvalid even though no part of the constitution is explicitly prevented from\nbeing amended, nor does the _basic structure_ doctrine protect any single\nprovision of the Constitution. Yet, this \"doctrine of basic features\" lays\ndown that, the Constitution when \"read as a whole\", that what comes to be\nunderstood as its basic features cannot be abridged, deleted or abrogated.\nWhat these \"basic features\" are, have not been defined exhaustively\nanywhere,[40] and whether a particular provision of the Constitution of India\nis a \"basic feature\" is decided as and when an issue is raised before a court\nin an instant case.[49]\n\nThe judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case laid down the\nfollowing as the basic structure of the constitution of India:[50]\n\n  1. The Supremacy of the Constitution\n  2. Republican and Democratic form of the Government\n  3. Secular Character of the Constitution\n  4. Maintenance of Separation of powers\n  5. The Federal Character of the Constitution[50]\n\nThis implies that the Parliament, while amending the Constitution, can only\namend it to the extent so as to not destroy any of the aforesaid characters.\nThe Supreme Court/High Court(s) may declare the amendment null and void if\nthis is violated, by performing [Judicial review](/wiki/Judicial_review\n\"Judicial review\"). This is typical of Parliamentary governments, where the\nJudiciary has to exercise an effective check on the exercise of the powers of\nthe Parliament, which in many respects is supreme.\n\nIn the [Golak Nath v. State of Punjab](/wiki/Golak_Nath_v._State_of_Punjab\n\"Golak Nath v. State of Punjab\") case of 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that\nthe State of Punjab could not restrict any of the Fundamental rights protected\nby the basic structure doctrine.[51] Extent of land ownership and practice of\nprofession, in this case, were held to be a fundamental right.[52] The ruling\nof the Golak Nath v. State of Punjab case was eventually overturned with the\nratification of the 24th Amendment in 1971.[52]\n\n## The constitution and the judiciary\n\nThe Judiciary interprets the Constitution as its final arbiter.[53] It is its\nduty as mandated by the Constitution, to be its watchdog, by calling for\nscrutiny any act of the legislature or the executive, who otherwise, are free\nto enact or implement these, from overstepping bounds set for them by the\nConstitution.[54] It acts like a guardian in protecting the fundamental rights\nof the people, as enshrined in the Constitution, from infringement by any\norgan of the state. It also balances the conflicting exercise of power between\nthe centre and a state or among states, as assigned to them by the\nConstitution.\n\nWhile pronouncing decisions under its constitutional mandate, it is expected\nto remain unaffected by pulls and pressures exerted by other branches of the\nstate, citizens or interest groups. And crucially, independence of the\njudiciary has been held to be a basic feature of the Constitution,[55][56] and\nwhich being inalienable, has come to mean – that which cannot be taken away\nfrom it by any act or amendment by the legislature or the executive.[57]\n\n### Judicial review\n\n[Judicial review](/wiki/Judicial_review \"Judicial review\") is adopted in the\nConstitution of India from [judicial review in the United\nStates](/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_States \"Judicial review in the\nUnited States\").[58] In the Indian constitution, Judicial review is dealt with\nunder [Article\n13](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_III\n\"s:Constitution of India/Part III\"). Judicial Review refers that the\nConstitution is the supreme power of the nation and all laws are under its\nsupremacy. Article 13 states that:\n\n  1. All pre-constitutional laws, if in part or completely in conflict with the Constitution, shall have all conflicting provisions deemed ineffective until an amendment to the Constitution ends the conflict. In such situation the provision of that law will again come into force, if it is compatible with the constitution as amended. This is called the _Doctrine of Eclipse_.[59]\n  2. In a similar manner, laws made after adoption of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly must be compatible with the constitution, otherwise the laws and amendments will be deemed to be void _[ab initio](/wiki/Ab_initio \"Ab initio\")_.\n  3. In such situations, the Supreme Court or High Court interprets the laws to decide if they are in conformity with the Constitution. If such an interpretation is not possible because of inconsistency, and where a separation is possible, the provision that is inconsistent with constitution is considered to be void. In addition to article 13, articles 32, 226 and 227 provide a constitutional basis to judicial review in India.[60]\n\nDue to the adoption of the thirty-eighth amendment, the Indian Supreme Court\nwas not allowed to preside over any laws adopted during a state of emergency\nthat infringes upon [fundamental rights](/wiki/Fundamental_rights \"Fundamental\nrights\") under article 32 i.e. Right to Constitutional Remedies.[61] Later\nwith the [Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India](/wiki/Forty-\nsecond_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India \"Forty-second Amendment of the\nConstitution of India\"), article 31 C was widened and article 368(4) and\n368(5) were added, which stated that any law passed by the parliament can't be\nchallenged in the court on any ground. The Supreme court in the [Minerva Mills\nv. Union of India](/wiki/Minerva_Mills_v._Union_of_India \"Minerva Mills v.\nUnion of India\") case said that Judicial Review is one of the basic character\nof the constitution and therefore can't be taken away quashing Article\n368(4)&(5) as well as 31 C.\n\n## The constitution – a living document\n\n\"The Indian Constitution is first and foremost a social document, and is aided\nby its Parts III & IV (Fundamental Rights & Directive Principles of State\nPolicy, respectively) acting together, as its chief instruments and its\nconscience, in realising the goals set by it for all the people.\"[Note 7][62]\n\nThe Constitution's provisions have consciously been worded in generalities,\nthough not in vague terms, instead of making them rigid and static with a\nfixed meaning or content as in an ordinary statute, so that they may be\ninterpreted by coming generations of citizens with the onward march of time,\nto apply to new and ever-changing and demanding situations, making the\nConstitution a living and an organic document.[63] Justice Marshall asserts:\n“It is the nature of (a) Constitution that only its great outlines be marked”.\nIt is a document intended “to endure for ages” and therefore, it has to be\ninterpreted not merely on the basis of the intention and understanding of the\nits framers but on the experience of its working effectively, in the existing\nsocial and political context.\n\nFor instance, \"right to life\" as guaranteed under Article 21,[nb 1] has by\ninterpretation been expanded to progressively mean a whole lot of human\nrights[nb 2]\n\nIn the conclusion of his _Making of India 's Constitution_, Justice Khanna\nwrites:\n\n> \"If the Indian constitution is our heritage bequeathed to us by our founding\n> fathers, no less are we, the people of India, the trustees and custodians of\n> the values which pulsate within its provisions! A constitution is not a\n> parchment of paper, it is a way of life and has to be lived up to. Eternal\n> vigilance is the price of liberty and in the final analysis, its only\n> keepers are the people.\"[67]\n\n## See also\n\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg/32px-Flag_of_India.svg.png)[India portal](/wiki/Portal:India \"Portal:India\")\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg/28px-A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png)](/wiki/File:A_coloured_voting_box.svg)[Politics portal](/wiki/Portal:Politics \"Portal:Politics\")\n\n  * [Constitution Day (India)](/wiki/Constitution_Day_\\(India\\) \"Constitution Day \\(India\\)\")\n  * [Constitutional economics](/wiki/Constitutional_economics \"Constitutional economics\")\n  * [Constitutionalism](/wiki/Constitutionalism \"Constitutionalism\")\n  * [History of democracy](/wiki/History_of_democracy \"History of democracy\")\n  * [List of national constitutions](/wiki/List_of_national_constitutions \"List of national constitutions\")\n  * [Magna Carta](/wiki/Magna_Carta \"Magna Carta\")\n  * [Rule according to higher law](/wiki/Rule_according_to_higher_law \"Rule according to higher law\")\n  * [Uniform civil code of India](/wiki/Uniform_civil_code_of_India \"Uniform civil code of India\")\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ The Constitution of Yugoslavia briefly held this position from 1974 till the nation split up in 1990.\n  2. **Jump up ^** The Constitution was in 22 Parts originally.
