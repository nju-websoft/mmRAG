with its [fertile\nbanks](/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_agriculture \"Ancient Egyptian agriculture\") and\n[delta](/wiki/Nile_Delta \"Nile Delta\"). Its rich history also comes from its\nnative inhabitants and outside influence. Much of [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt\n\"Egypt\")'s ancient history was a mystery until the secrets of ancient\n[Egyptian hieroglyphs](/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs \"Egyptian hieroglyphs\") were\ndeciphered with the discovery and help of the [Rosetta\nStone](/wiki/Rosetta_Stone \"Rosetta Stone\").

The [Lighthouse of\nAlexandria](/wiki/Lighthouse_of_Alexandria \"Lighthouse of Alexandria\"), one of\nthe other Seven Wonders, is gone. The [Library of\nAlexandria](/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria \"Library of Alexandria\") was the only\none of its kind for centuries.\n\nHuman settlement in Egypt dates back to at least 40,000 BC with\n[Aterian](/wiki/Aterian \"Aterian\") tool manufacturing.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n[Ancient Egyptian](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt \"Ancient Egypt\") civilization coalesced\naround 3150 BC with the political unification of [Upper and Lower\nEgypt](/wiki/Upper_and_Lower_Egypt \"Upper and Lower Egypt\") under the first\npharaoh of the [First Dynasty](/wiki/First_Dynasty_of_Egypt \"First Dynasty of\nEgypt\"), [Narmer](/wiki/Narmer \"Narmer\"). Predominately native Egyptian rule\nlasted until the conquest by the [Achaemenid Empire](/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire\n\"Achaemenid Empire\") in the sixth century BC.\n\nIn 332 BC, [Macedonian](/wiki/Macedonia_\\(ancient_kingdom\\) \"Macedonia\n\\(ancient kingdom\\)\") ruler [Alexander the Great](/wiki/Alexander_the_Great\n\"Alexander the Great\") conquered Egypt as he toppled the Achaemenids and\nestablished the [Hellenistic](/wiki/Hellenistic_period \"Hellenistic period\")\n[Ptolemaic Kingdom](/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom \"Ptolemaic Kingdom\"), whose first\nruler was one of Alexander's former generals, [Ptolemy I\nSoter](/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter \"Ptolemy I Soter\"). The Ptolemies had to fight\nnative rebellions and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the\ndecline of the kingdom and its final annexation by [Rome](/wiki/Ancient_Rome\n\"Ancient Rome\"). The death of [Cleopatra](/wiki/Cleopatra \"Cleopatra\") ended\nthe nominal independence of Egypt resulting in Egypt becoming one of the\nprovinces of the Roman Empire.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[Roman rule in Egypt](/wiki/Egypt_\\(Roman_province\\) \"Egypt \\(Roman\nprovince\\)\") (including [Byzantine](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire \"Byzantine\nEmpire\")) lasted from 30 BC to 641 AD, with a brief interlude of control by\nthe [Sasanian Empire](/wiki/Sasanian_Empire \"Sasanian Empire\") between\n619-629, known as [Sasanian Egypt](/wiki/Sasanian_Egypt \"Sasanian\nEgypt\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] After the [Muslim conquest of\nEgypt](/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Egypt \"Muslim conquest of Egypt\"), parts of\nEgypt became provinces of successive [Caliphates](/wiki/Caliphate \"Caliphate\")\nand other Muslim dynasties: [Rashidun Caliphate](/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate\n\"Rashidun Caliphate\") (632-661), [Umayyad Caliphate](/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate\n\"Umayyad Caliphate\") (661–750), [Abbasid Caliphate](/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate\n\"Abbasid Caliphate\") (750-909), [Fatimid Caliphate](/wiki/Fatimid_Caliphate\n\"Fatimid Caliphate\") (909-1171), [Ayyubid Sultanate](/wiki/Ayyubid_dynasty\n\"Ayyubid dynasty\") (1171–1260), and the [Mamluk\nSultanate](/wiki/Mamluk_Sultanate_\\(Cairo\\) \"Mamluk Sultanate \\(Cairo\\)\")\n(1250-1517). In 1517, [Ottoman](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman Empire\") sultan\n[Selim I](/wiki/Selim_I \"Selim I\") captured Cairo, absorbing Egypt into the\nOttoman Empire.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[Egypt remained entirely Ottoman](/wiki/Egypt_Eyalet \"Egypt Eyalet\") until\n1867, except during [French\noccupation](/wiki/French_campaign_in_Egypt_and_Syria \"French campaign in Egypt\nand Syria\") from 1798 to 1801.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\nStarting in 1867, Egypt became a nominally autonomous [tributary\nstate](/wiki/Vassal_and_tributary_states_of_the_Ottoman_Empire \"Vassal and\ntributary states of the Ottoman Empire\") called the [Khedivate of\nEgypt](/wiki/Khedivate_of_Egypt \"Khedivate of Egypt\"). However, Khedivate\nEgypt fell under British control in 1882 following the [Anglo-Egyptian\nWar](/wiki/Anglo-Egyptian_War \"Anglo-Egyptian War\"). After the end of [World\nWar I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\") and following the [Egyptian revolution\nof 1919](/wiki/Egyptian_revolution_of_1919 \"Egyptian revolution of 1919\"), the\n[Kingdom of Egypt](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Egypt \"Kingdom of Egypt\") was established.\nWhile a _de jure_ independent state, the United Kingdom retained control over\nforeign affairs, defense, and other matters. British occupation lasted until\n1954, with the [Anglo-Egyptian agreement of\n1954](/wiki/Suez_Crisis#Post_Egyptian_revolution_period \"Suez Crisis\").\n\nThe modern Republic of [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt \"Egypt\") was founded in 1953, and\nwith the complete withdrawal of British forces from the [Suez\nCanal](/wiki/Suez_Canal \"Suez Canal\") in 1956, it marked the first time in\n2300 years that Egypt was both fully independent and ruled by native\nEgyptians.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] President [Gamal Abdel\nNasser](/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser \"Gamal Abdel Nasser\") (president from 1956 to\n1970) introduced many reforms and created the short-lived [United Arab\nRepublic](/wiki/United_Arab_Republic \"United Arab Republic\") (with\n[Syria](/wiki/Syria \"Syria\")). His terms also saw the [Six-Day War](/wiki/Six-\nDay_War \"Six-Day War\") and the creation of the international [Non-Aligned\nMovement](/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement \"Non-Aligned Movement\"). His successor,\n[Anwar Sadat](/wiki/Anwar_Sadat \"Anwar Sadat\") (president from 1970 to 1981)\nchanged Egypt's trajectory, departing from many of the political, and economic\ntenets of Nasserism, re-instituting a multi-party system, and launching the\n[Infitah](/wiki/Infitah \"Infitah\") economic policy. He led Egypt in the [Yom\nKippur War](/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War \"Yom Kippur War\") of 1973 to regain Egypt's\nSinai Peninsula, which Israel had occupied since the Six-Day War of 1967. This\nlater led to the [Egypt–Israel Peace\nTreaty](/wiki/Egypt%E2%80%93Israel_Peace_Treaty \"Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty\").\n\nRecent Egyptian history has been dominated by events following nearly thirty\nyears of rule by former president [Hosni Mubarak](/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak \"Hosni\nMubarak\"). The [Egyptian revolution of 2011](/wiki/Egyptian_revolution_of_2011\n\"Egyptian revolution of 2011\") deposed Mubarak and resulted in the first\ndemocratically elected president in Egyptian history, [Mohamed\nMorsi](/wiki/Mohamed_Morsi \"Mohamed Morsi\"). Unrest after the 2011 revolution\nand related disputes led to the [2013 Egyptian coup\nd'état](/wiki/2013_Egyptian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat \"2013 Egyptian coup d'état\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Prehistory (pre–3100 BC)\n  * 2 Ancient Egypt (3100–332 BC)\n    * 2.1 Achaemenid rule\n    * 2.2 Second Achaemenid conquest\n  * 3 Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt (332 BC–641 AD)\n    * 3.1 Sassanid Egypt\n  * 4 Arab and Ottoman Egypt (641–1882)\n  * 5 British Protectorate (1882–1953)\n  * 6 Republican Egypt (since 1953)\n    * 6.1 Reign of Nasser\n    * 6.2 Reign of Sadat\n    * 6.3 Reign of Mubarak\n    * 6.4 Terrorist insurgency\n    * 6.5 Civil unrest since 2011\n      * 6.5.1 Revolution\n      * 6.5.2 Morsi's presidency\n      * 6.5.3 After Morsi\n      * 6.5.4 El-Sisi Presidency\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n\n## Prehistory (pre–3100\nBC)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Egypt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Prehistory \\(pre–3100 BC\\)\")]\n\nMain articles: [Prehistoric Egypt](/wiki/Prehistoric_Egypt \"Prehistoric\nEgypt\") and [Population history of Egypt](/wiki/Population_history_of_Egypt\n\"Population history of Egypt\")\n\nThere is evidence of [petroglyphs](/wiki/Petroglyphs \"Petroglyphs\") along the\n[Nile](/wiki/Nile \"Nile\") terraces and in desert oases. In the 10th millennium\nBC, a culture of [hunter-gatherers](/wiki/Hunter-gatherer \"Hunter-gatherer\")\nand [fishermen](/wiki/Fishing \"Fishing\") was replaced by a\n[grain](/wiki/Cereal \"Cereal\")-grinding culture. Climate changes and/or\novergrazing around 6000 BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt,\nforming the [Sahara](/wiki/Sahara \"Sahara\"). Early tribal peoples migrated to\nthe Nile River, where they developed a settled agricultural\n[economy](/wiki/Economic_system \"Economic system\") and more centralized\nsociety.[1]\n\nBy about 6000 BC, a [Neolithic](/wiki/Neolithic \"Neolithic\") culture rooted in\nthe Nile Valley.[2] During the Neolithic era, several predynastic cultures\ndeveloped independently in [Upper and Lower Egypt](/wiki/Upper_and_Lower_Egypt\n\"Upper and Lower Egypt\"). The [Badari culture](/wiki/Badari_culture \"Badari\nculture\") and the successor [Naqada](/wiki/Naqada_culture \"Naqada culture\")\nseries are generally regarded as precursors to [dynastic\nEgypt](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt \"Ancient Egypt\"). The earliest known Lower Egyptian\nsite, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years.\nContemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern\ncounterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct,\nbut maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of\n[Egyptian hieroglyphic](/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs \"Egyptian hieroglyphs\")\ninscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery\nvessels, dated to about 3200 BC.[3]\n\n## Ancient Egypt (3100–332\nBC)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Egypt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Ancient Egypt \\(3100–332 BC\\)\")]\n\nMain articles: [Ancient Egypt](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt \"Ancient Egypt\") and\n[History of ancient Egypt](/wiki/History_of_ancient_Egypt \"History of ancient\nEgypt\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.02.jpg/220px-\nEgypt.Giza.Sphinx.02.jpg)](/wiki/File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.02.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.02.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Great Sphinx](/wiki/Great_Sphinx_of_Giza \"Great Sphinx of Giza\") and the\n[Pyramids of Giza](/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex \"Giza pyramid complex\"), built\nduring the [Old Kingdom](/wiki/Old_Kingdom \"Old Kingdom\").\n\nA unified kingdom was founded 3150 BC by King [Menes](/wiki/Menes \"Menes\"),\nleading to a [series of dynasties](/wiki/List_of_Egyptian_dynasties \"List of\nEgyptian dynasties\") that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. [Egyptian\nculture](/wiki/Culture_of_Egypt \"Culture of Egypt\") flourished during this\nlong period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its\n[religion](/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_religion \"Ancient Egyptian religion\"),\n[arts](/wiki/Art_of_Ancient_Egypt \"Art of Ancient Egypt\"),\n[language](/wiki/Egyptian_language \"Egyptian language\") and customs. The\n[first two ruling dynasties](/wiki/Protodynastic_Period_of_Egypt\n\"Protodynastic Period of Egypt\") of a unified Egypt set the stage for the [Old\nKingdom](/wiki/Old_Kingdom \"Old Kingdom\") period, _c_. 2700–2200 BC., which\nconstructed many [pyramids](/wiki/Egyptian_pyramids \"Egyptian pyramids\"), most\nnotably the [Third Dynasty](/wiki/Third_dynasty_of_Egypt \"Third dynasty of\nEgypt\") [pyramid of Djoser](/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser \"Pyramid of Djoser\") and\nthe [Fourth Dynasty](/wiki/Fourth_dynasty_of_Egypt \"Fourth dynasty of Egypt\")\n[Giza Pyramids](/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex \"Giza pyramid complex\").\n\nThe [First Intermediate Period](/wiki/First_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt\n\"First Intermediate Period of Egypt\") ushered in a time of political upheaval\nfor about 150 years.[4] Stronger Nile floods and stabilization of government,\nhowever, brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the [Middle\nKingdom](/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt \"Middle Kingdom of Egypt\") _c_. 2040\nBC, reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh [Amenemhat\nIII](/wiki/Amenemhat_III \"Amenemhat III\"). A [second period of\ndisunity](/wiki/Second_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt \"Second Intermediate\nPeriod of Egypt\") heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in\nEgypt, that of the [Semitic-speaking](/wiki/Ancient_Semitic-speaking_peoples\n\"Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples\") [Hyksos](/wiki/Hyksos \"Hyksos\"). The\nHyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new\ncapital at [Avaris](/wiki/Avaris \"Avaris\"). They were driven out by an Upper\nEgyptian force led by [Ahmose I](/wiki/Ahmose_I \"Ahmose I\"), who founded the\n[Eighteenth Dynasty](/wiki/Eighteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt \"Eighteenth Dynasty of\nEgypt\") and relocated the capital from [Memphis](/wiki/Memphis,_Egypt\n\"Memphis, Egypt\") to [Thebes](/wiki/Thebes,_Egypt \"Thebes, Egypt\").\n\nThe [New Kingdom](/wiki/New_Kingdom \"New Kingdom\"), _c_. 1550–1070 BC, began\nwith the Eighteenth Dynasty, marking the rise of Egypt as an [international\npower](/wiki/Power_in_international_relations \"Power in international\nrelations\") that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far\nsouth as [Tombos](/wiki/Tombos_\\(Nubia\\) \"Tombos \\(Nubia\\)\") in\n[Nubia](/wiki/Nubia \"Nubia\"), and included parts of the [Levant](/wiki/Levant\n\"Levant\") in the east. This period is noted for some of the most well known\n[Pharaohs](/wiki/Pharaoh \"Pharaoh\"), including [Hatshepsut](/wiki/Hatshepsut\n\"Hatshepsut\"), [Thutmose III](/wiki/Thutmose_III \"Thutmose III\"),\n[Akhenaten](/wiki/Akhenaten \"Akhenaten\") and his wife\n[Nefertiti](/wiki/Nefertiti \"Nefertiti\"), [Tutankhamun](/wiki/Tutankhamun\n\"Tutankhamun\") and [Ramesses II](/wiki/Ramesses_II \"Ramesses II\"). The first\nhistorically attested expression of [monotheism](/wiki/Monotheism\n\"Monotheism\") came during this period as [Atenism](/wiki/Atenism \"Atenism\").\nFrequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom.

To gain recognition by the native Egyptian\npopulace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs.

The native Egyptian/Coptic culture continued to\nexist as well (the Coptic language itself was Egypt's most widely spoken\nlanguage until at least the 10th century).\n\nEgypt quickly became the Empire's [breadbasket](/wiki/Breadbasket\n\"Breadbasket\") supplying the greater portion of the Empire's grain in addition\nto flax, papyrus, glass, and many other finished goods. The city of Alexandria\nbecame a key trading outpost for the Roman Empire (by some accounts, the most\nimportant for a time).

The final\nloss of Egypt was of incalculable significance to the Byzantine Empire, which\nhad relied on Egypt for many agricultural and manufactured goods.\n\nWhen they defeated the Byzantine Armies in Egypt, the Arabs brought [Sunni\nIslam](/wiki/Sunni_Islam \"Sunni Islam\") to the country. Early in this period,\nEgyptians began to blend their new faith with their Christian traditions as\nwell as other indigenous beliefs and practices, leading to various\n[Sufi](/wiki/Sufism \"Sufism\") orders that have flourished to this day.[11]\nThese earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity.[14]\n\nMuslim rulers nominated by the [Islamic Caliphate](/wiki/Caliphate\n\"Caliphate\") remained in [control of Egypt](/wiki/History_of_Arab_Egypt\n\"History of Arab Egypt\") for the next six centuries, with [Cairo](/wiki/Cairo\n\"Cairo\") as the seat of the Caliphate under the\n[Fatimids](/wiki/Fatimid_Caliphate \"Fatimid Caliphate\").

By the late 13th century, Egypt linked the Red Sea,\nIndia, Malaya, and East Indies.[15] The Greek and Coptic languages and\ncultures went into a steep decline in favor of Arabic culture (though Coptic\nmanaged to last as a spoken language until the 17th century and remains a\nliturgical language today). The Mamluks continued to govern the country until\nthe [conquest of Egypt](/wiki/History_of_Ottoman_Egypt \"History of Ottoman\nEgypt\") by the [Ottoman Turks](/wiki/Ottoman_Turks \"Ottoman Turks\") in 1517,\nafter which it became a province of the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire\n\"Ottoman Empire\"). The mid-14th-century [Black Death](/wiki/Black_Death \"Black\nDeath\") killed about 40% of the country's population.[16]\n\nAfter the 15th century, the Ottoman invasion pushed the Egyptian system into\ndecline. The defensive militarization damaged its civil society and economic\ninstitutions.[15] The weakening of the economic system combined with the\neffects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion. Portuguese\ntraders took over their trade.[15] Egypt suffered six famines between 1687 and\n1731.[17] The 1784 [famine](/wiki/Famine \"Famine\") cost it roughly one-sixth\nof its population.[18]\n\nThe brief [French invasion of Egypt](/wiki/French_invasion_of_Egypt_\\(1798\\)\n\"French invasion of Egypt \\(1798\\)\") led by [Napoleon\nBonaparte](/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France \"Napoleon I of France\") began in 1798.\nThe expulsion of the French in 1801 by [Ottoman](/wiki/Ottoman_Turks \"Ottoman\nTurks\"), [Mamluk](/wiki/Mamluk \"Mamluk\"), and British forces was followed by\nfour years of anarchy in which Ottomans, Mamluks, and\n[Albanians](/wiki/Albanians \"Albanians\") — who were nominally in the service\nof the Ottomans – wrestled for power.

In later years, the dynasty became a\nBritish puppet.[19]\n\nHis primary focus was military: he annexed [Northern\nSudan](/wiki/Northern_Sudan \"Northern Sudan\") (1820–1824), [Syria](/wiki/Syria\n\"Syria\") (1833), and parts of [Arabia](/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula \"Arabian\nPeninsula\") and [Anatolia](/wiki/Anatolia \"Anatolia\"); but in 1841 the\nEuropean powers, fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself, forced him\nto return most of his conquests to the Ottomans, but he kept the Sudan and his\ntitle to Egypt was made hereditary. A more lasting result of his military\nambition is that it required him to modernize the country. Eager to adopt the\nmilitary (and therefore industrial) techniques of the great powers, he sent\nstudents to the West and invited training missions to Egypt. He built\nindustries, a system of canals for irrigation and transport, and reformed the\ncivil service.[19]\n\nThe introduction in 1820 of long-staple cotton, the Egyptian variety of which\nbecame notable, transformed its agriculture into a cash-crop\n[monoculture](/wiki/Monoculture \"Monoculture\") before the end of the century.\nThe social effects of this were enormous: land ownership became concentrated\nand many foreigners arrived, shifting production towards international\nmarkets.[19]\n\n## British Protectorate\n(1882–1953)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Egypt&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: British Protectorate \\(1882–1953\\)\")]\n\nMain articles: [History of Egypt under the\nBritish](/wiki/History_of_Egypt_under_the_British \"History of Egypt under the\nBritish\") and [History of modern Egypt](/wiki/History_of_modern_Egypt \"History\nof modern Egypt\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Cairo-\nDemonstrations1919.jpg/170px-Cairo-Demonstrations1919.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cairo-\nDemonstrations1919.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cairo-Demonstrations1919.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNationalists demonstrating in [Cairo](/wiki/Cairo \"Cairo\"), 1919\n\nBritish indirect rule lasted from 1882, when the British succeeded in\ndefeating the Egyptian Army at [Tel el-Kebir](/wiki/Battle_of_Tel_el-Kebir\n\"Battle of Tel el-Kebir\") in September and took control of the country, to the\n[1952 Egyptian revolution](/wiki/1952_Egyptian_revolution \"1952 Egyptian\nrevolution\") which made Egypt a republic and when British advisers were\nexpelled.\n\nMuhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son\n[Ibrahim](/wiki/Ibrahim_Pasha_of_Egypt \"Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt\") (in September\n1848), then by a grandson [Abbas I](/wiki/Abbas_I_of_Egypt \"Abbas I of Egypt\")\n(in November 1848), then by [Said](/wiki/Sa%27id_of_Egypt \"Sa'id of Egypt\")\n(in 1854), and [Isma'il](/wiki/Isma%27il_Pasha \"Isma'il Pasha\") (in 1863).\nAbbas I was cautious. Said and Ismail were ambitious developers, but they\nspent beyond their means. The [Suez Canal](/wiki/Suez_Canal \"Suez Canal\"),\nbuilt in partnership with the French, was completed in 1869. The cost of this\nand other projects had two effects: it led to enormous debt to European banks,\nand caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required. In\n1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt's share in the canal to the British\nGovernment. Within three years this led to the imposition of British and\nFrench\n[controllers](/wiki/History_of_Egypt_under_the_Muhammad_Ali_dynasty#Dual_control\n\"History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty\") who sat in the Egyptian\ncabinet, and, \"with the financial power of the bondholders behind them, were\nthe real power in the Government.\"[20]\n\nLocal dissatisfaction with Ismail and with European intrusion led to the\nformation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879, with [Ahmad\nUrabi](/wiki/Ahmad_Urabi \"Ahmad Urabi\") a prominent figure.

Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypt's\neconomy—tourism[31]—and in turn to the government, but it also devastated the\nlivelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support.[32]\n\nVictims of the campaign against the Egyptian state from 1992-1997 exceeded\n1,200[33] and included the head of the counter-terrorism police (Major General\nRaouf Khayrat), a speaker of parliament ([Rifaat el-Mahgoub](/wiki/Rifaat_el-\nMahgoub \"Rifaat el-Mahgoub\")), dozens of European tourists and Egyptian\nbystanders, and over 100 Egyptian police.[34]\n\nAt times, travel by foreigners in parts of [Upper Egypt](/wiki/Upper_Egypt\n\"Upper Egypt\") was severely restricted and dangerous.[35]\n\nOn 17 November 1997, [62 people, mostly tourists, were\nkilled](/wiki/Luxor_massacre \"Luxor massacre\") near [Luxor](/wiki/Luxor\n\"Luxor\").

These took\nthe form of an intensive campaign of [civil resistance](/wiki/Civil_resistance\n\"Civil resistance\") supported by a very large number of people and mainly\nconsisting of continuous mass demonstrations. By 29 January, it was becoming\nclear that Mubarak's government had lost control when a curfew order was\nignored, and the army took a semi-neutral stance on enforcing the curfew\ndecree. Some protesters, a very small minority in Cairo, expressed views\nagainst what they deemed was foreign interference, highlighted by the then-\nheld view that the U.S. administration had failed to take\nsides[_[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please\nclarify\")_], as well as linking the administration with Israel.[37]\n\nOn 11 February 2011, Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo.

A second round was\nheld on 16 and 17 June. On 24 June 2012, the election commission announced\nthat Mohamed Morsi had won the election, making him the first democratically\nelected president of Egypt. According to official results, Morsi took 51.7\npercent of the vote while Shafik received 48.3 percent.\n\nOn 8 July 2012, Egypt's new president [Mohamed Morsi](/wiki/Mohamed_Morsi\n\"Mohamed Morsi\") announced he was overriding the military [edict](/wiki/Edict\n\"Edict\") that dissolved the country's elected parliament and he called\nlawmakers back into session.[45]\n\nOn 10 July 2012, the [Supreme Constitutional Court of\nEgypt](/wiki/Supreme_Constitutional_Court_of_Egypt \"Supreme Constitutional\nCourt of Egypt\") negated the decision by Morsi to call the nation's parliament\nback into session.[46] On 2 August 2012, Egypt's Prime Minister Hisham Qandil\nannounced his 35-member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers including four from\nthe influential [Muslim Brotherhood](/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood \"Muslim\nBrotherhood\"), six others and the former military ruler [Mohamed Hussein\nTantawi](/wiki/Mohamed_Hussein_Tantawi \"Mohamed Hussein Tantawi\") as the\nDefence Minister from the previous Government.[47]\n\nOn 22 November 2012, Morsi issued a declaration immunizing his decrees from\nchallenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly drafting\nthe new constitution.[48] The declaration also requires a retrial of those\naccused in the Mubarak-era killings of protesters, who had been acquitted, and\nextends the mandate of the constituent assembly by two months. Additionally,\nthe declaration authorizes Morsi to take any measures necessary to protect the\nrevolution. Liberal and secular groups previously walked out of the\nconstitutional constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose\nstrict Islamic practices, while [Muslim Brotherhood](/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood\n\"Muslim Brotherhood\") backers threw their support behind Morsi.[49]\n\nThe move was criticized by [Mohamed ElBaradei](/wiki/Mohamed_ElBaradei\n\"Mohamed ElBaradei\"), the leader of Egypt's Constitution Party, who stated\n\"Morsi today usurped all state powers & appointed himself Egypt's new pharaoh\"\non his Twitter feed.[50][51] The move led to massive protests and violent\naction throughout Egypt.[52] On 5 December 2012, Tens of thousands of\nsupporters and opponents of Egypt's president clashed, hurling rocks and\nMolotov cocktails and brawling in Cairo's streets, in what was described as\nthe largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the\ncountry's revolution.[53] Six senior advisors and three other officials\nresigned from the government and the country's leading Islamic institution\ncalled on Morsi to stem his powers. Protesters also clamored from coastal\ncities to desert towns.[54]\n\nMorsi offered a \"national dialogue\" with opposition leaders but refused to\ncancel a 15 December vote on a draft constitution written by an Islamist-\ndominated assembly that has ignited two weeks of political unrest.[54]\n\n[A constitutional referendum](/wiki/Egyptian_constitutional_referendum,_2012\n\"Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2012\") was held in two rounds on 15 and\n22 December 2012, with 64% support, and 33% against. It was signed into law by\na presidential decree issued by Morsi on 26 December 2012. On 3 July 2013, the\nconstitution was suspended by order of the Egyptian army.\n\nOn 30 June 2013, on the first anniversary of the election of Morsi, millions\nof protesters across Egypt took to the streets and demanded the immediate\nresignation of the president. On 1 July, the Egyptian Armed Forces issued a\n48-hour ultimatum that gave the country's political parties until 3 July to\nmeet the demands of the Egyptian people. The presidency rejected the Egyptian\nArmy's 48-hour ultimatum, vowing that the president would pursue his own plans\nfor national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. On 3 July,\nGeneral [Abdel Fattah el-Sisi](/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi \"Abdel Fattah el-\nSisi\"), head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, announced that he had removed Morsi\nfrom power, suspended the constitution and would be calling new presidential\nand Shura Council elections and named [Supreme Constitutional\nCourt](/wiki/Supreme_Constitutional_Court_of_Egypt \"Supreme Constitutional\nCourt of Egypt\")'s leader, [Adly Mansour](/wiki/Adly_Mansour \"Adly Mansour\")\nas acting president.
