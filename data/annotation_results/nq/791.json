The mine is located in Alaska's Northwest\nArctic Borough, in the DeLong Mountains of the western Brooks Range, 90 miles\nnorth of Kotzebue and 55 miles from the Chukchi Sea.\n\nAt the end of 2007, the site's proven and probable reserves plus indicated\nresources amounted to 77.5 million tons, containing 17.5 percent zinc and 4.8\npercent lead, as well as 2.8 ounces per ton of silver. In addition, Red Dog\nalso contains 36.6 million tons of inferred resources. The entire deposit lies\ninside a relatively small area (one mile by one-half mile). The deposit is\nessentially flat-lying at the surface, making open pit mining the extraction\nmethod of\nchoice.[[1]](http://www.nana.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=22&Itemid=275)\n\n##\nGeography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Dog_Mine,_Alaska&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Geography\")]\n\nRed Dog Mine is located at [68°04′19″N 162°52′34″W﻿ / ﻿68.071989°N\n162.876044°W﻿ / 68.071989;\n-162.876044](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Red_Dog_Mine,_Alaska&params=68.071989_N_-162.876044_E_type:city_region:US).[5]\nIt is in the DeLong Mountains in the remote western [Brooks\nRange](/wiki/Brooks_Range \"Brooks Range\") about 90 miles (140 km) north of\n[Kotzebue](/wiki/Kotzebue,_Alaska \"Kotzebue, Alaska\") and 55 miles (89 km)\nfrom the [Chukchi Sea](/wiki/Chukchi_Sea \"Chukchi Sea\").\n\nRed Dog Mine is very isolated. It is located within the Northwest Arctic\nBorough, an area approximately the size of Indiana with only 11 communities,\nnone connected by roads, with a total population of only 7,208 people at the\n[2000 census](/wiki/United_States_Census,_2000 \"United States Census, 2000\").\nThe nearest of those communities are Noatak, population 428, roughly 50 miles\n(80 km) south and Kivalina, population 377, roughly 60 miles (100 km) west at\nthe 2000 census.[6]\n\nAlthough native populations have historically used the nearby area for\nseasonal food-gathering, there are no permanent residents at the mine or the\nport site. The mine's workforce consists of about 460 employees and\ncontractors, of which somewhat more than half will be on-site at any given\ntime. At the mine, everyone stays in the single large housing unit, tucked in\namong the process buildings near the edge of the open pit, while a small\nportion of the work force stays at the port site.[7]\n\nAccording to the [United States Census\nBureau](/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau \"United States Census Bureau\"), the\nCDP has a total area of 66.9 square miles (173 km2), all land.\n\n##\nDemographics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Dog_Mine,_Alaska&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Demographics\")]\n\nAs of the [census](/wiki/Census \"Census\") of 2000,[6] there were 32 people, 0\nhouseholds, and 0 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 0.5\npeople per square mile (0.2/km²). There were 0 housing units. The racial\nmakeup of the CDP was 31.25% [White](/wiki/Race_\\(United_States_Census\\) \"Race\n\\(United States Census\\)\"), 65.62% [Native\nAmerican](/wiki/Race_\\(United_States_Census\\) \"Race \\(United States\nCensus\\)\"), and 3.12% from two or more races.\n\nIn the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 18.8% from 18 to 24,\n62.5% from 25 to 44, and 18.8% from 45 to 64. The median age was 34 years. For\nevery 100 females there were 700.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and\nover, there were 700.0 males.\n\nThe median income for both males and females in the CDP was $0. The [per\ncapita income](/wiki/Per_capita_income \"Per capita income\") for the CDP was\n$34,438. 37.9% of the population were living below the [poverty\nline](/wiki/Poverty_line \"Poverty line\").\n\n##\nTransportation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Dog_Mine,_Alaska&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Transportation\")]\n\nA 52-mile (84 km) long haul road connects the mine to the mine's port site on\nthe Chukchi Sea. The region is accessible only by air, served by the [Red Dog\nAirport](/wiki/Red_Dog_Airport \"Red Dog Airport\"), except during the 100-day\nshipping season. Mine workers from remote villages in the region are ferried\nto the mine on small aircraft. [Alaska Airlines](/wiki/Alaska_Airlines \"Alaska\nAirlines\") is contracted by the mine to fly other mine workers out of\nAnchorage.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Dog_Mine,_Alaska&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"2010 City Population and Housing Occupancy Status\"](http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&prodType=table).
