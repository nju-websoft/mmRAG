In a [Rolling\nStone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\") interview, [Seth\nRogen](/wiki/Seth_Rogen \"Seth Rogen\") said he auditioned for the role. The\ncharacter is based on [Gareth Keenan](/wiki/Gareth_Keenan \"Gareth Keenan\") of\nthe [original British version of the show](/wiki/The_Office_\\(UK_TV_series\\)\n\"The Office \\(UK TV series\\)\"), who was played by actor [Mackenzie\nCrook](/wiki/Mackenzie_Crook \"Mackenzie Crook\").\n\nAll original series characters were adapted for the U.S. version. Unlike\n[Steve Carell](/wiki/Steve_Carell \"Steve Carell\"), Wilson watched every\nepisode of the original British series, and was a fan before he auditioned for\nthe U.S. version.[2] Wilson had originally auditioned for [Michael\nScott](/wiki/Michael_Scott_\\(The_Office\\) \"Michael Scott \\(The Office\\)\"), a\nperformance he described as a \"terrible [Gervais](/wiki/Ricky_Gervais \"Ricky\nGervais\") impersonation\";[2] however, the casting directors liked his audition\nas Dwight much more, and hired him for the role. Wilson based Dwight's\nhairstyle on the style he himself had when at the age of sixteen.[2] In an\ninterview, he said that he went to a [barber](/wiki/Barber \"Barber\") to get\n\"the worst haircut possible\".[3]\n\n## Character\ninformation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Character information\")]\n\nWhen the series begins, Dwight Schrute is a competent salesman, despite\nlacking general knowledge, at the [Scranton](/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania\n\"Scranton, Pennsylvania\") branch of the [paper](/wiki/Paper \"Paper\")\ndistribution company, [Dunder Mifflin](/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin \"Dunder Mifflin\").\nDwight formally held the title of \"Assistant to the Regional Manager\",[4] but\nconstantly refers to himself as \"Assistant Regional Manager\", attempting to\nelevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott.\n(Michael privately makes him Assistant Manager in \"[The\nFight](/wiki/The_Fight_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Fight \\(The Office\\)\")\", tells him\nthat no record/mention will be kept of the \"title change only\", then never\nacknowledges it again.) Dwight craves authority over his co-workers, and\nrelishes any minor task that Michael or anyone else will give him.[2] Although\nDwight acts superior to many individuals and is often resourceful in crises,\nhe is shown to actually be quite gullible, ignorant, and naïve.[2] For this\nreason, he is easily tricked and pranked by his desk-mate and fellow salesman,\nJim Halpert.[5]\n\nDwight often speaks in a halting, intense manner, even in casual\nconversations.[2] At the office, his most recurring formal wear is a\n[mustard](/wiki/Mustard_\\(color\\) \"Mustard \\(color\\)\")-colored, short-sleeved\ncollared [shirt](/wiki/Shirt \"Shirt\"), with a dark [necktie](/wiki/Necktie\n\"Necktie\") and, usually, a brown suit jacket. He often uses [one-\nupmanship](/wiki/One-upmanship \"One-upmanship\") to better himself over his\npeers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight\nwill sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to please Michael, but\noften fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the\njokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it\nis shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the\ntoys on Michael's desk in a manner that made Michael happy, unbeknownst to\nMichael.\n\nDwight is a former [volunteer sheriff deputy](/wiki/Auxiliary_police\n\"Auxiliary police\"),[6] but has to step down after breaking his pledge by\nhelping his boss pass his drug test in the episode 'Drug Testing'. He is also\na [notary public](/wiki/Notary_public \"Notary public\"); this creates\ndifficulties when Angela desires to send him a notarized letter regarding\ntheir break-up. He resides on his family's [beet](/wiki/Beet \"Beet\")\n[farm](/wiki/Farm \"Farm\"), alongside his [cousin](/wiki/Cousin \"Cousin\"),\n[Mose](/wiki/List_of_characters_from_The_Office_\\(US_T.V._series\\)#Mose_Schrute\n\"List of characters from The Office \\(US T.V. series\\)\") (played by\nproducer/writer [Michael Schur](/wiki/Michael_Schur \"Michael Schur\")). Dwight\nhas affinities for [paintball](/wiki/Paintball \"Paintball\"), _[Battlestar\nGalactica](/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica \"Battlestar Galactica\")_ , [ping\npong](/wiki/Ping_pong \"Ping pong\"), [survivalism](/wiki/Survivalism\n\"Survivalism\"), [Goju Ryu](/wiki/G%C5%8Dj%C5%AB-ry%C5%AB \"Gōjū-ryū\") karate[7]\nand [weapons](/wiki/Weapon \"Weapon\"). He also has a preference to ride in the\nback seat of [cars](/wiki/Cars \"Cars\") behind the driver, because it is the\nsafest location in a car.\n\nIn \"[Whistleblower](/wiki/Whistleblower_\\(The_Office\\) \"Whistleblower \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", encouraged to invest in [real estate](/wiki/Real_estate \"Real\nestate\") by former [CEO](/wiki/CEO \"CEO\") and owner of Dunder Mifflin, [Jo\nBennett](/wiki/Jo_Bennett \"Jo Bennett\"), Dwight decides to purchase the\nindustrial park building. He has shown entrepreneurial traits, like converting\nthe building lobby into a coffee shop in\n\"[Nepotism](/wiki/Nepotism_\\(The_Office\\) \"Nepotism \\(The Office\\)\")\",\nconverting an empty room in the office building into a state-of-the-art\n[gym](/wiki/Gym \"Gym\") in \"[Mrs. California](/wiki/Mrs._California \"Mrs.\nCalifornia\")\", and organizing a barn maze before [Halloween](/wiki/Halloween\n\"Halloween\"), where kids can pay admission to play, in\n\"[WUPHF.com](/wiki/WUPHF.com \"WUPHF.com\")\".\n\nIn an episode commentary on the [season\none](/wiki/The_Office_\\(U.S._season_1\\) \"The Office \\(U.S. season 1\\)\")\n[DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\"), Wilson refers to Dwight as a \"[fascist](/wiki/Fascist\n\"Fascist\") [nerd](/wiki/Nerd \"Nerd\")\". In a feature on the [season\nthree](/wiki/The_Office_\\(U.S._season_3\\) \"The Office \\(U.S. season 3\\)\") DVD,\nWilson describes Dwight as \"someone who does not hate the system, but has a\ndeep and abiding love for it\".[8]\n\nAll throughout the series Dwight drives a maroon 1987 Pontiac Trans Am, until\nthe finale where he owns an orange 2012 Dodge Challenger.\n\n### Family and\nchildhood[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Family and childhood\")]\n\nIn \"[Lecture Circuit](/wiki/Lecture_Circuit \"Lecture Circuit\")\", Dwight claims\nto remember his own [birth](/wiki/Birth \"Birth\"), including his father, Dwight\nSchrute II, delivering him from the [womb](/wiki/Womb \"Womb\"), and his mother\nbiting off the [umbilical cord](/wiki/Umbilical_cord \"Umbilical cord\").[9] In\n\"[Grief Counseling](/wiki/Grief_Counseling_\\(The_Office\\) \"Grief Counseling\n\\(The Office\\)\")\", Dwight states that he was a twin, but he \"resorbed\" his\ntwin while still in his mother's womb (this occurrence is called [twin\nembolisation syndrome](/wiki/Absorbed_twin \"Absorbed twin\")), causing him to\nbelieve that he now has \"the strength of a grown man and a little\n[baby](/wiki/Baby \"Baby\")\". He also claims to have been born weighing 13 lb 5\noz (6.0 kg), rendering his mother incapable of walking for three months and\ntwo days,[10] and in \"[Baby Shower](/wiki/Baby_Shower \"Baby Shower\")\", he\nclaims to have performed his own [circumcision](/wiki/Circumcision\n\"Circumcision\"). In \"[Viewing Party](/wiki/Viewing_Party \"Viewing Party\")\", he\ninforms [Jim](/wiki/Jim_Halpert \"Jim Halpert\") and [Pam\nHalpert](/wiki/Pam_Beesly \"Pam Beesly\") that, in the Schrute family, the\nyoungest child raises the other children.\n\nLittle is known about Dwight's parents, except that his father used to take\nhim [hunting](/wiki/Hunting \"Hunting\"), cheated in [games](/wiki/Game \"Game\"),\nmade him and his siblings biscuits for breakfast every morning, and that he\nbattled [obesity](/wiki/Obesity \"Obesity\"), high [blood\npressure](/wiki/Blood_pressure \"Blood pressure\"), and high\n[cholesterol](/wiki/Cholesterol \"Cholesterol\").\n\nDwight's maternal grandfather, whose surname is Manheim (according to Dwight's\nweb log on [NBC.com](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\"))[11] fought in the [Second World\nWar](/wiki/Second_World_War \"Second World War\"). He killed twenty men before\nbeing imprisoned in an [Allied](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II \"Allies of World\nWar II\") [prison camp](/wiki/Prisoner-of-war_camp \"Prisoner-of-war camp\")\n(revealed in \"[The Fight](/wiki/The_Fight_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Fight \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\"), implying that he was a [soldier](/wiki/Soldier \"Soldier\") in the\n[German army](/wiki/Wehrmacht \"Wehrmacht\"). In \"[Dunder Mifflin\nInfinity](/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin_Infinity \"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\")\", Dwight\ntells the documentary film crew that his grandfather is (at the time of the\nepisode) 103 years old, and is still \"puttering around down in\n[Argentina](/wiki/Argentina \"Argentina\")\", implying that his grandfather was\none of the members of the [SS](/wiki/Schutzstaffel \"Schutzstaffel\") [who fled\ninto South America](/wiki/Ratlines_\\(World_War_II\\) \"Ratlines \\(World War\nII\\)\"). Dwight attempted to visit him once, but his travel visa was protested\nby the [Shoah Foundation](/wiki/Shoah_Foundation \"Shoah Foundation\").[12] In\n\"[Take Your Daughter to Work\nDay](/wiki/Take_Your_Daughter_to_Work_Day_\\(The_Office\\) \"Take Your Daughter\nto Work Day \\(The Office\\)\")\", Michael refers to Dwight's grandmother as a\n\"[Nazi](/wiki/Nazi \"Nazi\") war criminal\".[13] Dwight's father and grandfather\nare also named Dwight Schrute; however, his [Amish](/wiki/Amish \"Amish\")\ngreat-grandfather was named Dwide Schrude. In \"[Casino\nNight](/wiki/Casino_Night \"Casino Night\")\", Dwight reveals that the\n[tuxedo](/wiki/Tuxedo \"Tuxedo\") he is wearing is the one that his grandfather\nwas buried in. In a deleted scene from \"[The\nSurplus](/wiki/The_Surplus_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Surplus \\(The Office\\)\")\",\nDwight tells Angela that his family came to the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States_of_America \"United States of America\") on a\n[U-boat](/wiki/U-boat \"U-boat\"). It is revealed in\n\"[Money](/wiki/Money_\\(The_Office\\) \"Money \\(The Office\\)\")\" that it is a\ntradition in the Schrute family that when a male has\n[intercourse](/wiki/Sexual_intercourse \"Sexual intercourse\") with a woman, he\nis rewarded with a bag of wild [oats](/wiki/Oats \"Oats\") that are left on his\ndoorstep by his parents. Dwight also speaks German, but his knowledge of it is\n\"pre-industrial and mostly [religious](/wiki/Religious \"Religious\")\", as might\nbe expected if the language was learned exclusively in a Mennonite or Amish\nchurch or context.\n\nDwight was [shunned](/wiki/Amish#Shunning \"Amish\") by his family from the age\nof four until his sixth birthday, for forgetting to save the excess oil from a\ncan of [tuna](/wiki/Tuna \"Tuna\").[14] He lost a grade school [spelling\nbee](/wiki/Spelling_bee \"Spelling bee\") to Raj Patel by misspelling the word\n\"failure\", in front of the entire school.[15] In seventh grade, Dwight played\nthe invented role of \"Mutey the Mailman\" in a production of\n_[Oklahoma!](/wiki/Oklahoma! \"Oklahoma!\")_ He explains that there were not\nenough roles for all of the children, so they made up roles.[16]\n\nDwight lives in a nine-[bedroom](/wiki/Bedroom \"Bedroom\"),\none-[bathroom](/wiki/Bathroom \"Bathroom\") farmhouse (with the single bathroom\nlocated under the porch, as revealed in \"[Office\nOlympics](/wiki/Office_Olympics \"Office Olympics\")\") on his family's 60-acre\n(240,000 m2) [beet](/wiki/Beet \"Beet\") farm, with his cousin Mose. The cousins\nsell beets to local stores, restaurants, and roadside beet stands.[17] Dwight\nuses part of his farm to grow [hemp](/wiki/Hemp \"Hemp\").[18] Dwight and Mose\nhave also turned Schrute Farms into a ramshackle [bed and\nbreakfast](/wiki/Bed_and_breakfast \"Bed and breakfast\"), that was visited by\nJim and Pam, during \"[Money](/wiki/Money_\\(The_Office\\) \"Money \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\".[19] The bed and breakfast had three theme rooms: America,\nIrrigation, and Nighttime. Schrute Farms was also to be the site of Andy and\nAngela's wedding before the two broke off their engagement. In \"[Garden\nParty](/wiki/Garden_Party_\\(The_Office\\) \"Garden Party \\(The Office\\)\")\", Andy\nthrows a [garden party](/wiki/Garden_party \"Garden party\") at Schrute Farms in\norder to impress new CEO [Robert California](/wiki/Robert_California \"Robert\nCalifornia\"), and at the end of the episode, Robert also discusses the\npossibility of holding his birthday party at the farm.\n\nAccording to one of Dwight's web logs on NBC.com's \"Schrute-Space\", he had an\nuncle, named Gunther, a [goat](/wiki/Goat \"Goat\") farmer, who fled the Allied\ninvasion of Germany and married a [Finnish](/wiki/Finnish_people \"Finnish\npeople\") woman, with whom he had 17 children.[20] He also had an Uncle Girt,\nwho revealed that the Schrute family has an ongoing hatred of [Harry S.\nTruman](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S. Truman\"), because they were staunch\nsupporters of [Thomas Dewey](/wiki/Thomas_Dewey \"Thomas Dewey\"). In another\n[blog](/wiki/Blog \"Blog\"), he mentions a cousin named Heindl, who received\nnumerous injuries and infections from an attack by a small [dog](/wiki/Dog\n\"Dog\").[21]\n\n## Interests[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Interests\")]\n\nDwight is trained in the art of [surveillance](/wiki/Surveillance\n\"Surveillance\"), and is a former [Lackawanna\nCounty](/wiki/Lackawanna_County,_Pennsylvania \"Lackawanna County,\nPennsylvania\") volunteer [sheriff](/wiki/Sheriff \"Sheriff\")'s deputy.[6] He\nhas a purple belt in [Goju-Ryu](/wiki/Goju-Ryu \"Goju-Ryu\") karate, and is the\n[senpai](/wiki/Senpai_and_k%C5%8Dhai \"Senpai and kōhai\") at his dojo.[7]\nDwight is a [pop culture](/wiki/Pop_culture \"Pop culture\") and [sci-\nfi](/wiki/Science_fiction \"Science fiction\") enthusiast, who has expressed\nfanship of many sci-fi movies and popular [television](/wiki/Television\n\"Television\") series. In the episode \"[The Fire](/wiki/The_Fire_\\(The_Office\\)\n\"The Fire \\(The Office\\)\")\", he mentioned the movie _[The\nCrow](/wiki/The_Crow_\\(1994_film\\) \"The Crow \\(1994 film\\)\")_ as being his\nfavorite film. He hints at belief in fictional creatures such as\n[androids](/wiki/Android_\\(robot\\) \"Android \\(robot\\)\"),\n[zombies](/wiki/Zombies \"Zombies\") and [vampires](/wiki/Vampires \"Vampires\")\n(though curiously, despite having claimed in \"[Business\nSchool](/wiki/Business_School_\\(The_Office\\) \"Business School \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", to have shot a [werewolf](/wiki/Werewolf \"Werewolf\") (that was\nactually his neighbor's dog), he says in one of his blog entries that he does\nnot believe in them; however, he may have simply been denying claims of\nwerewolves at Schrute Farms in order to prevent potential visitors from being\nfrightened away).[21] He enjoys, and is shown to be skilled at, playing [table\ntennis](/wiki/Table_tennis \"Table tennis\"), and states that many of his heroes\nare table tennis players.[22] His musical tastes vary, but [heavy\nmetal](/wiki/Heavy_metal_music \"Heavy metal music\") and [classic\nrock](/wiki/Classic_rock \"Classic rock\") seem to be a recurring theme.[1] His\npersonal musical talents are not lacking, as he plays [guitar](/wiki/Guitar\n\"Guitar\") and [recorder](/wiki/Recorder_\\(musical_instrument\\) \"Recorder\n\\(musical instrument\\)\"), and sings, as well.[13] He has a fascination with\ncars; he usually checks a car's suspension, especially [muscle\ncars](/wiki/Muscle_cars \"Muscle cars\"). He drives a 1987 [Pontiac Trans\nAm](/wiki/Pontiac_Trans_Am \"Pontiac Trans Am\") though in the [Finale (The\nOffice)](/wiki/Finale_\\(The_Office\\) \"Finale \\(The Office\\)\") he's driving a\n2013 [Dodge Challenger](/wiki/Dodge_Challenger \"Dodge Challenger\"). His\ntechnological talents are limited, but he shows a passion for the online role\nplaying game _[Second Life](/wiki/Second_Life \"Second Life\")_ , in which the\nonly differences between himself and his [avatar](/wiki/Avatar_\\(computing\\)\n\"Avatar \\(computing\\)\") is that his avatar has the last name 'Shelford' and\nthe ability to [fly](/wiki/Flight \"Flight\").[18] He also shows an interest in\n[trains](/wiki/Trains \"Trains\"), as he is restoring a turn-of-the-century\n[steam engine](/wiki/Steam_engine \"Steam engine\") in his\n[slaughterhouse](/wiki/Slaughterhouse \"Slaughterhouse\"), during \"[The\nMeeting](/wiki/The_Meeting_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Meeting \\(The Office\\)\")\",\nwhich has him bonding with [Toby Flenderson](/wiki/Toby_Flenderson \"Toby\nFlenderson\"), as they share the same interest. In \"[Todd\nPacker](/wiki/Todd_Packer_\\(The_Office\\) \"Todd Packer \\(The Office\\)\")\", it is\nrevealed that Dwight does not know who [Justin Bieber](/wiki/Justin_Bieber\n\"Justin Bieber\") is, asking Jim \"Who is Justice Beaver?\", leaving Jim to\nanswer \"A crime-fighting [beaver](/wiki/Beaver \"Beaver\").\"\n\nDwight owns an impressive array of weaponry. In addition to [Laser\nTag](/wiki/Laser_Tag \"Laser Tag\") and [paintball](/wiki/Paintball \"Paintball\")\nequipment, he has a [crossbow](/wiki/Crossbow \"Crossbow\") range at his farm\n(\"[Office Olympics](/wiki/Office_Olympics \"Office Olympics\")\") and, when he\nwas named official Security Supervisor of the Scranton branch,[6] hinted that\nhe might bring a [bo staff](/wiki/Bo_\\(weapon\\) \"Bo \\(weapon\\)\") to work. He\nmaintained a hidden arsenal of weapons around the office, including [pepper\nspray](/wiki/Pepper_spray \"Pepper spray\"), [nunchucks](/wiki/Nunchaku\n\"Nunchaku\"), [throwing stars](/wiki/Shuriken \"Shuriken\"), a [stun\ngun](/wiki/Electroshock_weapon \"Electroshock weapon\"), a\n[boomerang](/wiki/Boomerang \"Boomerang\"), [handcuffs](/wiki/Handcuffs\n\"Handcuffs\"), a [nightstick](/wiki/Club_\\(weapon\\) \"Club \\(weapon\\)\"), a pair\nof [brass knuckles](/wiki/Brass_knuckles \"Brass knuckles\") and a [Chinese\nsword](/wiki/Jian \"Jian\"), all of which were confiscated by Toby.[23] Dwight\nalso claimed to have sat at his desk for an entire day with a [spud\ngun](/wiki/Spud_gun \"Spud gun\"), without any difficulty from Security.[6]\nDwight also uses a real [gun](/wiki/Gun \"Gun\"), a [Colt\nAnaconda](/wiki/Colt_Anaconda \"Colt Anaconda\"), fired within city limits, to\nstart off the race in \"[Fun Run](/wiki/Fun_Run \"Fun Run\")\".[24] In \"[Branch\nWars](/wiki/Branch_Wars \"Branch Wars\")\", he produces a disturbing number of\n[Molotov cocktails](/wiki/Molotov_cocktail \"Molotov cocktail\") for a\n[panty](/wiki/Underwear \"Underwear\") raid on [Utica](/wiki/Utica,_New_York\n\"Utica, New York\").

Also, in\nthis episode, it is shown that Dwight has extensive knowledge of how to\nsurvive in the [wilderness](/wiki/Wilderness \"Wilderness\"), being able to\nprovide himself with food, and, by observing Michael, from a distance, through\nthe scope of his center-fire rifle, he stops Michael from poisoning himself,\nalthough it is not clear whether the [mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms \"Mushrooms\")\nMichael started to ingest were actually poisonous.[25]\n\nDwight is vocal about his views on justice, which is reflected in his\ntelevision viewing habits, as he enjoys watching and has great admiration for\n[Judge Judy](/wiki/Judith_Sheindlin \"Judith Sheindlin\"), as well as [Vic\nMackey](/wiki/Vic_Mackey \"Vic Mackey\") on _[The Shield](/wiki/The_Shield \"The\nShield\")_. In \"[The Negotiation](/wiki/The_Negotiation \"The Negotiation\")\",\n[Roy Anderson](/wiki/Roy_Anderson_\\(The_Office\\) \"Roy Anderson \\(The\nOffice\\)\") attacks Jim, because he kissed Roy's [fiancee](/wiki/Fiancee\n\"Fiancee\"), Pam, but Dwight intercepts the attack with [pepper\nspray](/wiki/Pepper_spray \"Pepper spray\").[23] Throughout the episode, Jim\nattempts to show his appreciation, but Dwight refuses to accept his gifts,\nsimply stating \"[Citizens](/wiki/Citizens \"Citizens\") do not accept prizes for\nbeing citizens\".[23] In [\"Drug\nTesting\"](/wiki/Drug_Testing_\\(The_Office_episode\\) \"Drug Testing \\(The Office\nepisode\\)\"), Dwight finds half of a [joint](/wiki/Cannabis_\\(drug\\) \"Cannabis\n\\(drug\\)\") in the parking lot, which incites him to carry out a severe, and\nthorough, investigation.[6] When he discovers that Michael might have been\nexposed to illegal drugs at a concert, he substitutes his own\n[urine](/wiki/Urine \"Urine\") during the mandatory drug test.[6] Dwight then\nresigns from his volunteer position at the Sheriff's Department, because he\nfeels that he is no longer worthy of working there. In \"[Frame\nToby](/wiki/Frame_Toby \"Frame Toby\")\", Dwight states that he is skilled at\nframing people, as well as [animals](/wiki/Animals \"Animals\"), revealing that\nhe once framed a [raccoon](/wiki/Raccoon \"Raccoon\") for opening a\n[Christmas](/wiki/Christmas \"Christmas\") gift, and a [bear](/wiki/Bear \"Bear\")\nfor eating out of the [garbage](/wiki/Garbage \"Garbage\"), although, he had\nmade it obvious to the [police](/wiki/Police \"Police\") that he wanted Toby to\nbe imprisoned.[6] In the episode \"[Women's\nAppreciation](/wiki/Women%27s_Appreciation \"Women's Appreciation\")\", he is\nquoted as saying \"Better a thousand innocent men are locked up, than one\nguilty man roam free.\"\n\nIn \"[Conflict Resolution](/wiki/Conflict_Resolution_\\(The_Office\\) \"Conflict\nResolution \\(The Office\\)\")\", Dwight states that he does not like to smile, as\nshowing one's teeth is a submission signal in [primates](/wiki/Primates\n\"Primates\"), and that whenever someone smiles at him, \"all [he] sees is a\n[chimpanzee](/wiki/Chimpanzee \"Chimpanzee\"), begging for its life\". Dwight\nowns many exotic pets including [piranhas](/wiki/Piranhas \"Piranhas\"),\n[frogs](/wiki/Frogs \"Frogs\"), an [arctic wolf](/wiki/Arctic_wolf \"Arctic\nwolf\"), a [raccoon](/wiki/Raccoon \"Raccoon\"), a porcupine named Henrietta, and\nan [opossum](/wiki/Opossum \"Opossum\"), although the wolf escaped due to poor\nrestraints and he flushed his piranhas down the toilet. He also has an\ninterest in [bears](/wiki/Bear \"Bear\"), and is ready to debate the habits and\ncharacteristics of different species of bears. He also has expressed a\nsurprisingly large affection towards baby otters.\n\nIn \"[Costume Contest](/wiki/Costume_Contest \"Costume Contest\")\", Dwight claims\nto be able to sit on a fence, and that he is even able to sleep on one,\nstating that \"The trick is to do it face down, with the post in your mouth\".\n\nIt is revealed in the \"Suit Warehouse\" episode that as a child Dwight\ncollected cat feces.\n\n##\nRelationships[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Relationships\")]\n\nIn \"[Drug Testing](/wiki/Drug_Testing_\\(The_Office\\) \"Drug Testing \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", Dwight states that he likes his co-workers, \"with four\nexceptions\", leaving it up to the audience to make educated guesses about whom\nthese four exceptions are. The four are most likely [Jim\nHalpert](/wiki/Jim_Halpert \"Jim Halpert\"), [Ryan\nHoward](/wiki/Ryan_Howard_\\(The_Office\\) \"Ryan Howard \\(The Office\\)\"),\n[Meredith Palmer](/wiki/Meredith_Palmer \"Meredith Palmer\") and [Toby\nFlenderson](/wiki/Toby_Flenderson \"Toby Flenderson\"), due to Michael's hatred\nof him. However, it is also probable that [Phyllis Lapin-\nVance](/wiki/Phyllis_Lapin-Vance \"Phyllis Lapin-Vance\") could be one of the\nexceptions, as, on many occasions, she and Dwight are shown to have a strained\nrelationship. [Kelly Kapoor](/wiki/Kelly_Kapoor \"Kelly Kapoor\") is likewise a\nviable choice as her ditsy nature contrasts Dwight's overly serious character,\nas we see later in the same episode during Dwight's interrogation of Kelly.\nThis theory is also reinforced by Angela's hatred of Kelly and the influence\nAngela may hold as Dwight's girlfriend at the time. Pam Halpert is also a\npossible exception as she is often an accomplice to Jim's pranks against\nDwight.\n\n### Angela\nMartin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Angela Martin\")]\n\nTowards the middle of season 2, Dwight develops a secret relationship with\nAngela Martin. Pam begins to suspect a relationship between the two, in\n\"[E-mail Surveillance](/wiki/E-mail_Surveillance \"E-mail Surveillance\")\", by\nobserving their interactions, suspicions which are strengthened in \"[The\nInjury](/wiki/The_Injury \"The Injury\")\" and \"[Conflict\nResolution](/wiki/Conflict_Resolution_\\(The_Office\\) \"Conflict Resolution\n\\(The Office\\)\")\", and confirmed by \"[Traveling\nSalesmen](/wiki/Traveling_Salesmen_\\(The_Office\\) \"Traveling Salesmen \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", where Angela confides in Pam about her relationship, using code\nnames.[1] In \"[Michael's Birthday](/wiki/Michael%27s_Birthday \"Michael's\nBirthday\")\", Ryan discovers the relationship between the two when he overhears\na coded conversation between them in the kitchen, while in \"The Negotiation\"\nJim discovers the relationship while coming out of the office bathroom after\nquitting time, to find Dwight and Angela kissing (he then tells the\ndocumentary crew that, with his silence, the debt he feels to Dwight is\nrepaid).[23]\n\nIn the episode \"[Fun Run](/wiki/Fun_Run \"Fun Run\")\", Angela asks Dwight to\ncare for her sick cat, Sprinkles. Instead of caring for the feline, Dwight\nfeels he should [kill it as a waste of resources](/wiki/Animal_euthanasia\n\"Animal euthanasia\"), and then tells Angela Sprinkles was dead when he\narrived.[24] When he lets the truth slip out shortly after, Angela terminates\ntheir relationship. Jim, on a visit to Dwight's beet farm, finds Dwight\nsitting alone at night, contemplating Angela's [cherub](/wiki/Cherub \"Cherub\")\n[figurine](/wiki/Figurine \"Figurine\") and moaning in anguish.[19]\n\nIn the [fourth season](/wiki/The_Office_\\(U.S._season_4\\) \"The Office \\(U.S.\nseason 4\\)\") finale \"[Goodbye, Toby](/wiki/Goodbye,_Toby \"Goodbye, Toby\")\",\nDwight is obviously hurt when Angela's boyfriend, Andy, proposes to her.\nHowever, in the final scene of the episode, Phyllis catches Dwight [having\nsex](/wiki/Having_sex \"Having sex\") with Angela in the office.[26]\n\nIn the [fifth season](/wiki/The_Office_\\(U.S._season_5\\) \"The Office \\(U.S.\nseason 5\\)\") premiere, \"[Weight Loss](/wiki/Weight_Loss_\\(The_Office\\) \"Weight\nLoss \\(The Office\\)\")\", Dwight and Angela have resumed a covert relationship,\nusing a storage room in the warehouse to have sex. In \"[Crime\nAid](/wiki/Crime_Aid \"Crime Aid\")\", Andy and Angela set a date for their\nwedding. After some advice from Phyllis, Dwight gives Angela an ultimatum:\ncall off the engagement, or he will no longer be with her. She chooses to\nmarry Andy. When Andy learns about Angela's affair with Dwight, [a\nduel](/wiki/The_Duel_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Duel \\(The Office\\)\") between Dwight\nand Andy takes place, but both realize that Angela has been lying to them, and\nbreak up with her. For quite some time afterwards, Dwight and Angela avoid\neach other.\n\nIn the [season 6](/wiki/The_Office_\\(U.S._season_6\\) \"The Office \\(U.S. season\n6\\)\") episode \"[The Delivery](/wiki/The_Delivery_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Delivery\n\\(The Office\\)\")\", Dwight, witnessing Jim and Pam talk to customers about\ntheir unborn child, decides that he wants a child, and asks Angela to be the\nmother. They sign an elaborate contract, including eating guidelines for\nAngela to follow when she is [pregnant](/wiki/Pregnant \"Pregnant\"), and how\nthe baby will be raised. While Angela is excited by the reconciliation, Dwight\ndoesn't share her romantic feelings. When Dwight develops an interest in Pam's\nfriend Isabel, he tells Angela to forget about the contract; this infuriates\nAngela and she sues him in small-claims court. When an arbitrator tells them\nthat the contract is valid and would involve a $30,000 settlement (because it\nwould be illegal to force Dwight and Angela to procreate), Dwight cuts a deal\nwith Angela for five sessions of sex. He then proceeds to abuse his genitals\nin an effort to sterilize himself, and fends off Angela's efforts to be\nromantic.\n\nIn [Season 7](/wiki/The_Office_\\(U.S._season_7\\) \"The Office \\(U.S. season\n7\\)\"), after Angela meets a [state senator](/wiki/State_senator \"State\nsenator\") who she finds much more personable than Dwight, she voids the pact\nin [WUPHF.com](/wiki/WUPHF.com \"WUPHF.com\").\n\nIn \"[Jury Duty](/wiki/Jury_Duty_\\(The_Office\\) \"Jury Duty \\(The Office\\)\")\",\nit is revealed that, a month before her wedding to the state senator, [Robert\nLipton](/wiki/List_of_characters_from_The_Office_\\(U.S._TV_series\\)#Robert_Lipton\n\"List of characters from The Office \\(U.S. TV series\\)\"), Dwight and Angela\nhad sex, as Robert was not fulfilling Angela's sexual needs, so Dwight\nbelieves that he is the baby's biological father.[27] In \"[New\nGuys](/wiki/New_Guys \"New Guys\")\", it is revealed that he is not the father.\n\nIn season 9, they become close again first when Dwight finds out that Robert\nis cheating on Angela with Oscar, and later in \"[Moving\nOn](/wiki/Moving_On_\\(The_Office\\) \"Moving On \\(The Office\\)\")\" when Angela\nhelps him take care of his elderly aunt. They share a kiss, but afterwards\nboth say that she should remain faithful to her husband. After inheriting his\naunt's beet farm, Dwight starts a relationship with neighboring brusselsprout\nfarmer Esther Bruegger ([Nora Kirkpatrick](/wiki/Nora_Kirkpatrick \"Nora\nKirkpatrick\")). When Dwight seems to be getting serious with Esther and the\nSenator has publicly dumped Angela, Angela breaks down and admits to [Oscar\nMartinez](/wiki/Oscar_Martinez_\\(The_Office\\) \"Oscar Martinez \\(The Office\\)\")\nthat she still loves Dwight. On the day that he intends to ask Esther to marry\nhim, Dwight instead proposes to Angela. She says yes, finally admitting that\nhe is the father of her son Phillip. (\"[A.A.R.M.](/wiki/A.A.R.M. \"A.A.R.M.\")\")\n\n### Michael\nScott[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Michael Scott\")]\n\nDwight holds a high level of respect for Michael, viewing him as a model for\nsuccess, and often participating with Michael's ill-conceived schemes.[2]\nHowever, he betrays Michael numerous times, such as when he goes over\nMichael's head to vie for the manager's job in \"[The\nCoup](/wiki/The_Coup_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Coup \\(The Office\\)\")\". Despite this,\nMichael frequently dismisses Dwight and often appears embarrassed by his\nantics; for much of the series, he also refuses to promote Dwight from\n\"Assistant to the Regional Manager\" to \"Assistant Regional Manager\". In later\nseasons, Dwight was shown to return the favor, such as Dwight telling Michael\nthat he would have a better career if he'd taken a job at Home Depot. Several\ntimes throughout the series, however, it is revealed that Michael does care\nabout Dwight's feelings, and the two sometimes share bonding moments. In\n\"[Training Day](/wiki/Training_Day_\\(The_Office\\) \"Training Day \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", Dwight is unhappy when the open branch manager position goes to\n[Deangelo Vickers](/wiki/Deangelo_Vickers \"Deangelo Vickers\"), and when he\nlearns that Michael did not recommend him for the job, as he led him to\nbelieve, he snubs Michael and goes to a meeting Vickers has called, leaving\nMichael standing outside, by himself. In \"[Goodbye,\nMichael](/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael \"Goodbye, Michael\")\", Dwight is still\nfrustrated with Michael, but his hostility turns into heartfelt appreciation\nas Michael hands him the recommendation letter. At first, the letter does not\nseem to impress him, but, as he reads through, he realizes that Michael really\ndoes respect him. They are later seen engaging in a friendly paintball fight,\nand Dwight's loyalty to Michael is once again restored. Also, after Michael\nleft, Dwight did not have the same respect for Deangelo and Andy that Dwight\npreviously had for Michael, implying that Dwight truly respects and values\nMichael. In a deleted scene from \"Finale\", Dwight stated that Michael sent him\nhis \"World's Best Boss\" mug when he became Regional Manager.\n\nIn the episode \"Finale\", as Jim explains that the \"Bestest Mench\" (best man)\nin Dwight's wedding must be older than him, Dwight is disappointed. However,\nthe camera reveals that Michael returned, and the two continue to engage in a\nfriendly conversation. During the wedding, Michael is present behind Angela\nand Dwight getting married, eventually attending the reception. He watches as\nhis \"family\" is sitting together, and is last seen dancing with Dwight.\n\n### Jim Halpert[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Jim Halpert\")]\n\nDwight is frequently the victim of practical jokes by co-workers Jim Halpert\nand Pam Beesly, including putting his desk supplies in the snack machine,\nputting his stapler into jello, and moving his desk into the men's restroom,\nalthough it appears that he remains oblivious to Pam's involvement; these\npranks tend to exploit his stubborn and gullible nature. Dwight's frustration\nwith Jim's pranks reaches a crisis point in \"[Conflict\nResolution](/wiki/Conflict_Resolution_\\(The_Office\\) \"Conflict Resolution\n\\(The Office\\)\")\", when Dwight threatens to quit unless Jim is\ntransferred.[28] Dwight occasionally pulls successful pranks on Jim in turn,\nmost prominently in \"[Classy Christmas](/wiki/Classy_Christmas \"Classy\nChristmas\")\" where he subjects Jim to a barrage of pranks revolving around\nsnowballs. Professionally, Dwight wins the 2005 Salesman of the Year Award,\nalthough, this is likely due to, at least in part, his theft of Jim's largest\nclient.[15]\n\nDuring \"[Initiation](/wiki/Initiation_\\(The_Office\\) \"Initiation \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", Dwight tells Ryan he regrets that he and Jim never got along. In\n\"[Traveling Salesmen](/wiki/Traveling_Salesmen_\\(The_Office\\) \"Traveling\nSalesmen \\(The Office\\)\")\", Dwight quits and hugs Jim as a farewell which\nsurprises Jim as he does not know that Dwight quit. Later, Jim is irritated\nwhen Andy replaces Dwight and even says that he misses Dwight. Earlier in the\nsame episode, Jim and Dwight make an incredibly efficient sales team,\nfunctioning well as a duo and thinking similarly in their tactics. The two\nwere paired together when they began as traveling salesmen at the company.\nDwight plans to demote Jim from the Assistant Regional Manager spot, and make\nhim miserable, during \"[The Job](/wiki/The_Job_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Job \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\".[29]\n\nDwight's relationship with Jim mellows somewhat in later seasons, and they, at\ntimes, cooperate effectively on sales calls or running the office in Michael's\nabsence, sometimes even socializing together. Jim often supports Dwight when\nhe is genuinely hurt or in danger (such as in\n\"[Money](/wiki/Money_\\(The_Office\\) \"Money \\(The Office\\)\")\" and \"[Last Day in\nFlorida](/wiki/Last_Day_in_Florida \"Last Day in Florida\")\") and occasionally\ncompliments his successes (such as in \"[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting)\nManager](/wiki/Dwight_K._Schrute,_\\(Acting\\)_Manager \"Dwight K. Schrute,\n\\(Acting\\) Manager\")\"). However, when Jim is promoted to co-manager, Dwight's\nenmity returns to full force, and he conducts an ongoing campaign to depose\nJim, who eventually resumes his old job as sales representative in \"[Manager\nand Salesman](/wiki/Manager_and_Salesman \"Manager and Salesman\")\".\n\nJim and Dwight team up in \"[Todd Packer](/wiki/Todd_Packer_\\(The_Office\\)\n\"Todd Packer \\(The Office\\)\")\" to remove [Todd Packer](/wiki/Todd_Packer \"Todd\nPacker\") after he returns to the Dunder Mifflin offices and takes Dwight's\ndesk. The two at first cannot agree on a plan, but eventually trick Packer\ninto thinking he has got a job offer in Tallahassee.[30]\n\nDuring \"[After Hours](/wiki/After_Hours_\\(The_Office\\) \"After Hours \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", Jim enlists Dwight into trying to get Kathy, an unwanted female\nsuitor, out of his room by tricking Dwight into thinking that he has bedbugs.\nThis prompts Dwight to overreact, first by stripping down to ward off bugs and\nthen spraying Jim's bed with cleaning chemicals. However, the ploy works when\nKathy exits the room. Jim and Dwight are then shown sharing ice cream and a\nfriendly smile in Dwight's room, while watching TV on his bed, where it is\nimplied Jim will have to stay the night due to the chemicals in his own room,\nas earlier Dwight suggested Jim stay with Kathy. In \"[Last Day in\nFlorida](/wiki/Last_Day_in_Florida \"Last Day in Florida\")\", Robert California\nconfides to Jim that he's going to terminate Dwight's plans to launch the\nSabre store, effectively terminating Dwight's job altogether. Jim tries to let\nDwight know, who dismisses his warnings as nothing more than just another\nprank and insults Jim throughout the day, including in front of the other\nSabre staff. At Pam's insistence, Jim tries to tell Dwight one more time\nbefore he's dismissed, just as Dwight is about to accept what he thinks is his\npromotion in the board room. However, Jim physically attacks Dwight just\nbefore he goes in, and the two had a wrestling match to which Jim finally\nconcedes. When Dwight steps in, he sees that Packer, who has stolen Dwight's\npromotion in the meantime, takes the fall and is promptly fired by Robert in\nthe meeting. Defeated, Dwight walks out of the boardroom and lends Jim a hand\nup and returns to Scranton. When Kelly sees Dwight, she mentions that she\nthought Dwight was staying in Florida, prompting Jim to distract her with a\ncompliment.\n\nDuring season 9's \"[Dwight Christmas](/wiki/Dwight_Christmas \"Dwight\nChristmas\")\", Dwight is convinced by Jim to hold a traditional Christmas party\nin the style of his family. Jim must leave before the party is over and Dwight\nis noticeably emotionally upset when Jim must leave. Later, when Jim returns,\nDwight embraces him in a hug. Soon after, in \"[Suit\nWarehouse](/wiki/Suit_Warehouse \"Suit Warehouse\")\", Dwight absent-mindedly\nsays \"love you\" at the end of a phone conversation with Jim, much to his\nembarrassment and the bemusement of his coworkers.\n\nIn \"[Livin' the Dream](/wiki/Livin%27_the_Dream \"Livin' the Dream\")\", the 3rd-\nto-last episode of the series, Jim suggests to [David\nWallace](/wiki/David_Wallace_\\(The_Office\\) \"David Wallace \\(The Office\\)\")\nthat Dwight deserves to replace [Andy Bernard](/wiki/Andy_Bernard \"Andy\nBernard\") as Regional Manager because Dwight loves paper more than anyone\nelse. David agrees and Dwight is promoted to Regional Manager at the end of\nthe episode as a result; Dwight subsequently appoints Jim to fill his old\nposition, Assistant to the Regional Manager.\n\nIn the final episode of the series \"[Finale](/wiki/Finale_\\(The_Office\\)\n\"Finale \\(The Office\\)\")\", Dwight asks Jim to be the best man at his wedding.\nJim throws Dwight a commendable bachelor party rife with surprises (which Jim\nrefers to as \"pranks\"). Before the wedding Jim informs Dwight that, under\nSchrute tradition, he is not allowed to be best man as he is younger than him.\nJim surprises him with the arrival of [Michael\nScott](/wiki/Michael_Scott_\\(The_Office\\) \"Michael Scott \\(The Office\\)\"). The\nwedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man.\nLater in the episode Jim and Pam tell Dwight they are quitting so Jim can\npursue a sports marketing career in Austin, but Dwight fires them instead so\nhe can give them [severance packages](/wiki/Severance_package \"Severance\npackage\").\n\n### Pam Halpert[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Pam Halpert\")]\n\nAlthough she is often involved in Jim's pranks on Dwight, Dwight has, at\ncertain times, displayed a curious sense of protectiveness towards her. In\n\"[Back from Vacation](/wiki/Back_from_Vacation \"Back from Vacation\")\" and\n\"[Diwali](/wiki/Diwali_\\(The_Office\\) \"Diwali \\(The Office\\)\")\", he comforts a\ntearful Pam, and in \"[China](/wiki/China_\\(The_Office\\) \"China \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", he secretly allows Pam to [save\nface](/wiki/Face_\\(sociological_concept\\) \"Face \\(sociological concept\\)\")\nwhen she feels vulnerable about her job abilities. In \"[The\nJob](/wiki/The_Job_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Job \\(The Office\\)\")\", Dwight offers\nPam the position of \"Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager\", and following\nJim's advice concerning any offers from Dwight to be involved in something\nsecret, she accepts. Though Jim presumably meant this as the opening move of a\nprank, Pam instead uses it as a bonding opportunity between her and Dwight.\n\nThe two briefly become best friends while he suffers a\n[concussion](/wiki/Concussion \"Concussion\") in \"[The Injury](/wiki/The_Injury\n\"The Injury\")\". In the season 6 episode \"[The\nDelivery](/wiki/The_Delivery_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Delivery \\(The Office\\)\")\",\nDwight shows more signs of his begrudging friendship with Jim and Pam during\nPam's pregnancy. In the episode, he is sent to the Halperts' house to retrieve\nPam's [iPod](/wiki/IPod \"IPod\"), while they are at the hospital. Instead of\nfinding the iPod and bringing it back to her, Dwight completely rebuilds and\nrepaints their kitchen, after discovering [mold](/wiki/Mold \"Mold\"). He also\nadvises Pam on how to keep her daughter, Cece, from crying, during \"[Viewing\nParty](/wiki/Viewing_Party \"Viewing Party\")\", by relating his child rearing\nexperiences. Dwight's odd friendship with Pam is explored again in\n\"[Doomsday](/wiki/Doomsday_\\(The_Office\\) \"Doomsday \\(The Office\\)\")\". At this\npoint, Pam is the only one in the office who is able to understand Dwight's\ninner feelings, as she successfully convinces him to deactivate his doomsday\nmachine. It is implied at the end of the episode that Dwight, despite his\noutward contempt for his coworkers, feels a sense of responsibility (and\npossibly even affection) towards them.\n\nIn a talking-head interview, in the episode\n\"[Tallahassee](/wiki/Tallahassee_\\(The_Office\\) \"Tallahassee \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", Dwight talks about how first impressions last forever. He recalls\nthat, when he first met Pam, she said something to him that \"slightly rubbed\n[him] the wrong way\", and while he has since loved working with her, even\nstating that she is wonderful, due to that first impression, he hates her. In\nthe episode \"The Whale\", Dwight openly tells Pam that he considers her his\nfriend. In the final episode of the series, Dwight refers to Pam as his \"best\nfriend\", and he ensures that she and Jim get a large severance as they leave\nDunder Mifflin.\n\n### Andy\nBernard[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Andy Bernard\")]\n\nAs a result of the Scranton-Stamford merger, Dwight loses his number two\nposition to Jim and engages in an ongoing battle with new salesman [Andy\nBernard](/wiki/Andy_Bernard \"Andy Bernard\"), to gain Michael's favor for\n\"third-in-command\". The struggle comes to a climax in \"[Traveling\nSalesmen](/wiki/Traveling_Salesmen_\\(The_Office\\) \"Traveling Salesmen \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\".[1] In Season 4, Andy and Dwight are shown to work well together\nas a sales team, but Andy's successful pursuit of Angela, after she broke up\nwith Dwight, was irritating to him. When Andy gets engaged to Angela, Dwight\nis greatly upset by this, and embarks on an affair with her. This affair\nculminates in a short-lived fight between Andy and Dwight, when they discover\nAngela has lied to both of them, about not having had sex with the other. In\n\"[Michael Scott Paper Company](/wiki/Michael_Scott_Paper_Company \"Michael\nScott Paper Company\"),\" they once again find themselves courting the same\nwoman – [Erin Hannon](/wiki/Erin_Hannon \"Erin Hannon\"). However, by the end of\nthe fifth season, Andy and Dwight become friends, and discover they both share\na mutual interest in music and hunting.[31]\n\n### Ryan\nHoward[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Ryan Howard\")]\n\nIn the beginning of the series, Dwight feels threatened by [Ryan\nHoward](/wiki/Ryan_Howard_\\(The_Office\\) \"Ryan Howard \\(The Office\\)\"), to\nwhom Michael often assigns personal tasks. He continues to resent Ryan,\nthroughout the second season, often addressing him as \"Temp\",[4] even after\nRyan took over Jim's position.[12] In the beginning of season 2, Dwight's\nfriendship with Michael was slightly torn during \"[The\nFire](/wiki/The_Fire_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Fire \\(The Office\\)\")\", when Michael\nseems to be viewing Ryan more favorably than Dwight, and in \"[Performance\nReview](/wiki/Performance_Review \"Performance Review\")\", in which Michael must\nevaluate Ryan.[32] In \"[Initiation](/wiki/Initiation_\\(The_Office\\)\n\"Initiation \\(The Office\\)\")\", Dwight decides to assist Ryan, during his first\nsales call, although the two get off to a rough start when Dwight\n[hazes](/wiki/Hazing \"Hazing\") him in a series of bizarre initiation rituals.\nSoon afterwards, Dwight takes Ryan on his first meeting, which ends in\ndisaster. Ryan then eggs the potential customer's building out of spite, and\nDwight develops some respect for him.[33]\n\nDuring season 4, Dwight, along with Michael, comes to Ryan's rescue when they\nvisit him in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), when he\ngets into a scuffle.\n\nRyan and Dwight later team up again in season 6, when Dwight plans to sabotage\nJim's occupation, as branch co-manager.[34]\n\n### Romantic\nrelationships[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Romantic relationships\")]\n\nA subtle running joke throughout the series is Dwight's surprising success\nwith attractive women, with Michael often failing to \"hook up\" at the same\ntime. Despite Dwight's unusual appearance and mannerisms, he manages to\nattract women, who usually develop stronger feelings for him than vice versa.\nMichael has even pointed out how socially weird Dwight is acting, only for the\nwoman to brush it off. In \"[Night Out](/wiki/Night_Out_\\(The_Office\\) \"Night\nOut \\(The Office\\)\")\", Dwight hooks up with a women's\n[basketball](/wiki/Basketball \"Basketball\") player, while Michael fails in his\nattempts with other women. As Michael and Dwight leave the club, the woman\ncalls out for Dwight to call her, which he says to Michael that he will not\ndo. In \"[Niagara](/wiki/Niagara_\\(The_Office\\) \"Niagara \\(The Office\\)\")\",\nMichael and Dwight compete for the attention of Pam's best friend, Isabel.\nWhen Dwight starts talking about his farm, Michael tries to explain that no\none can connect with his experiences as farmer, only for Isabel to become\ninterested in Dwight's [horses](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\"). Dwight ultimately\nmanages to have sex with her, and she begins to develop deeper feelings for\nhim which he does not return, although it is finally hinted in \"[The\nDelivery](/wiki/The_Delivery_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Delivery \\(The Office\\)\")\"\nthat Dwight might have more intimate feelings for her than he originally let\non. They meet again at the bar in \"[Happy\nHour](/wiki/Happy_Hour_\\(The_Office\\) \"Happy Hour \\(The Office\\)\")\", and bond\nfurther, kissing at the end of the episode. In a chat at OfficeTally.com,\n[Mindy Kaling](/wiki/Mindy_Kaling \"Mindy Kaling\") noted that Dwight is not a\ntypical \"nerd\" character, that he is a \"farmer and kind of strapping and\ntall\", and it generally makes sense that he does well with the opposite sex.\nIn season 9, he begins to date an attractive neighboring farmer named Esther\n([Nora Kirkpatrick](/wiki/Nora_Kirkpatrick \"Nora Kirkpatrick\")). He ultimately\nends his relationship with her in \"[A.A.R.M.](/wiki/A.A.R.M. \"A.A.R.M.\")\". In\nthe final episode, Dwight marries [Angela Martin](/wiki/Angela_Martin \"Angela\nMartin\").\n\n## Character\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Character reception\")]\n\nThe Dwight Schrute character has had a very positive reception, and is often\ncited as one of the most popular characters on the show. According to\n_[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment Weekly\")_ he\nis one of the \"greatest sidekicks.\"[35] In [TV Guide](/wiki/TV_Guide \"TV\nGuide\")'s list of the top 100 characters in television history, Dwight was\nranked 85th. In an [ABC News](/wiki/ABC_News \"ABC News\") interview with Rainn\nWilson, the interviewer commented that \"Words barely describe Dwight Schrute,\nthe suck-up salesman and assistant to the regional manager of the Scranton\nbranch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company...\"[36] and \"Dwight, as played by\nthe 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in\ntelevision comedy. Dwight is a survivalist geek, a student of karate who likes\nto shoot a crossbow and watch \"Battlestar Galactica\" on television. And he\ntakes himself very, very seriously...\"[36] [E! News](/wiki/E!_News \"E! News\")\ncommented that Rainn Wilson should be nominated for an [Emmy\nAward](/wiki/Emmy_Award \"Emmy Award\") for his performance of Dwight,\ncommenting: \"...Who's laughing now? Who's laughing now, Dwight Schrute? Oh,\nonly the ten million-plus people who watched as you pepper sprayed the living\ndaylights out of Roy for trying to pop Jim in the face last night. My God,\nhave I missed you, man. Mr. Schrute, you are the reason I love my job, my\nfriend. It is the selflessly heroic actions of a man such as you that make\ntelevision a nice place to be on a Thursday night. You may just be an everyday\ncitizen who does not accept prizes for being a citizen, but you'd best be\naccepting a supporting actor Emmy nod this year, because, hot damn if you\ndon't deserve it.\"[37]\n\nAnother positive review of the character was given by PopMatters, an online\nentertainment news site. The review stated: \"One of the show’s ironies is that\nMichael and Dwight, hapless though they might be within the office or in most\nsocial settings, are actually top salesmen...Undeterred, or unaware of any of\nthis, Dwight carries on with his dreams of grandeur, even instituting a reward\nsystem called \"Schrute Bucks\" for employees who please him during a brief but\ntyrannical reign as branch manager...Dwight approaches sales with the same\nmilitaristic fervor as everything else in his life, and it pays off for him\n(maybe that’s one of the reasons why, when Jim gives Dwight one of Benito\nMussolini’s speeches to deliver when he accepts a sales award in Season Two,\nDwight delivers it so enthusiastically that he gets a standing\novation)...\"[38] [Metalcore](/wiki/Metalcore \"Metalcore\") band [The Devil\nWears Prada](/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_\\(band\\) \"The Devil Wears Prada\n\\(band\\)\") named a song \"Assistant to the Regional Manager,\" alluding to\nDwight's position. In addition, the band created a T-shirt design that\nindirectly associates itself with Dwight by strongly resembling him. It is\nnamed \"Guy Wearing Tie.\"[39]\n\n## Outside of _The\nOffice_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Outside of The Office\")]\n\n### Bobblehead\ndoll[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Bobblehead doll\")]\n\nIn the episode \"[Valentine's\nDay](/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_\\(The_Office_episode\\) \"Valentine's Day \\(The\nOffice episode\\)\")\", Dwight is given a [bobblehead doll](/wiki/Bobblehead_doll\n\"Bobblehead doll\") as a Valentine's gift, from Angela. Following the episode,\nfans of the show petitioned NBC to make the bobblehead doll available for\npurchase on their online store.[40] NBC responded by creating an initial run\nof 4,000 bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately.[40] The creator\nof the show, [Greg Daniels](/wiki/Greg_Daniels \"Greg Daniels\"), joked about\nthe bobbleheads, saying \"Yes, they are fun, but they also serve a business\npurpose. People who want to manage by consensus can buy six and keep them\nnodding all the time to whatever they say.\"[40] In 2010 Hallmark released a\nsmaller talking version of the doll as part of their 2010 Christmas Keepsake\nOrnament selection.\n\n### Résumé[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Résumé\")]\n\nIn \"[Halloween](/wiki/Halloween_\\(The_Office\\) \"Halloween \\(The Office\\)\")\",\nJim and Pam uploaded Dwight's resume to \"[Monster.com](/wiki/Monster.com\n\"Monster.com\"), [Craigslist](/wiki/Craigslist \"Craigslist\"), and\n[Google](/wiki/Google \"Google\").\"[41] A producer actually did create a Monster\naccount for Dwight and uploaded his résumé a month before the episode aired.\nIt can be found by employers with resume database access who search for\nsalesmen in [Scranton, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania \"Scranton,\nPennsylvania\").[42] The résumé stated that he was willing to relocate to\nanother state,[42] wanted a salary close to $30,000 ([USD](/wiki/USD\n\"USD\")),[42] desired the job title of Regional Manager,[42] was currently\n\"Assistant to the Regional Manager\",[42] and had a [Bachelor's\nDegree](/wiki/Bachelor%27s_Degree \"Bachelor's Degree\").[42] The posted résumé\nalso stated: \"My time spent at Dunder Mifflin was very enjoying. I had the\nopportunity to learn from an experienced and talented boss. My branch\nconsistently was one of the top sellers of the company...\"[42]\n\n### Schrute\nFarms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: Schrute Farms\")]\n\nIn \"[Money](/wiki/Money_\\(The_Office_episode\\) \"Money \\(The Office\nepisode\\)\")\", Pam refers to a [TripAdvisor](/wiki/TripAdvisor \"TripAdvisor\")\npage for Dwight's [bed and breakfast](/wiki/Bed_and_breakfast \"Bed and\nbreakfast\"). This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms.[43] Jim and Pam\ndiscover that Dwight is running the Schrute Farm as an\n\"[agritourism](/wiki/Agritourism \"Agritourism\")\" bed and breakfast. They spend\nthe night there, taking part in table-making demonstrations, beet wine-making,\nand distributing [manure](/wiki/Manure \"Manure\"). That night, however, Jim\nhears an unnerving moaning sound throughout the night, later shown to be\nDwight in his room crying over his breakup with Angela. The TripAdvisor page\nsaid:\n\n\"Schrute Farms is the number one beet-related [agritourism](/wiki/Agritourism\n\"Agritourism\") destination in Northeastern Pennsylvania. We offer the finest\naccommodations for the casual traveler and/or radish enthusiast. Come join us\nand experience majestic Schrute Farms.\"[43]\n\nJim and Pam (\"JandP2\") also posted a review, which can be seen on the reviews\npage. It read: \"The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and\nthe natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of\nsimpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture\nwill satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your\nheart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your\nfriends. Plenty of parking! The staff's attention to detail and devotion to\ncleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave\ngood-bye, Schrute Farms delivers.\"[43]\n\nAn angry Angela also put a review up, and mentioned the death of her cat as a\nmain cause for the review. It said: \"I have to warn people about the\nproprietor of Schrute Farms—he may portray himself as a gentleman farmer, but\nhe is not what he seems! He killed my cat, Sprinkles! Who knows what he might\ndo to you or your loved ones...\"[43]\n\nAccording to Dwight, during the [Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American\nCivil War\"), while the [Battle of Gettysburg](/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg\n\"Battle of Gettysburg\") was known for having the most deaths, the battle of\nSchrute Farms was known for having the highest DPA (deaths per acre). He also\nclaimed it was the northernmost battle during the Civil War. However, in\nreality, it was actually a safe haven for men who wanted relief from the war\nto focus on artistic lifestyles. It is insinuated that this was a camp for\nhomosexual soldiers. Melvin Fifer Garris is the only known soldier to write\nhome from Schrute Farms during the Civil War.\n\n### Vice presidential bid\njoke[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit\nsection: Vice presidential bid joke\")]\n\nExternal video\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/16px-\nNuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png) [Rainn Wilson on The Tonight Show discussing the\n\"nomination\"](http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/#mea=251910)  \n---  \n  \nOn the May 7, 2008, episode of _[The Daily Show with Jon\nStewart](/wiki/The_Daily_Show_with_Jon_Stewart \"The Daily Show with Jon\nStewart\")_ , [US Senator](/wiki/US_Senator \"US Senator\") and [Republican\nParty](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party \\(United\nStates\\)\") presidential nominee [John McCain](/wiki/John_McCain \"John McCain\")\njoked that Dwight Schrute would be his vice presidential candidate\nchoice.[44][45] [Rainn Wilson](/wiki/Rainn_Wilson \"Rainn Wilson\") appeared on\n_[The Tonight Show](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show \"The Tonight Show\")_ on May 14,\n2008, and read to [Jay Leno](/wiki/Jay_Leno \"Jay Leno\") a list of demands from\nDwight in exchange for being vice president.[46] Included in this list was\nbeing able to pilot [Air Force One](/wiki/Air_Force_One \"Air Force One\") at\nany time, and only to be addressed as \"Iceman\" while piloting.[46] He also\ndemanded that [Jack Bauer](/wiki/Jack_Bauer \"Jack Bauer\") be immediately\npromoted to [United States Secretary of\nDefense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense \"United States Secretary of\nDefense\"), his [bunker](/wiki/Bunker \"Bunker\") to include a\n[foosball](/wiki/Foosball \"Foosball\") table and be [zombie](/wiki/Zombie\n\"Zombie\")-proof, and that the [Secret\nService](/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service \"United States Secret Service\")\nmembers be armed with [nunchakus](/wiki/Nunchaku \"Nunchaku\"), [throwing\nstars](/wiki/Throwing_star \"Throwing star\"), and\n[flamethrowers](/wiki/Flamethrower \"Flamethrower\").[46] Finally, he demanded a\nflamethrower, an [Iron Man](/wiki/Iron_Man \"Iron Man\") suit, and that fellow\ncharacter Michael Scott be an \"ambassador to [Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii\n\"Hawaii\").\"[46]\n\n### Dwight in academic\nresearch[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Schrute&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: Dwight in academic research\")]\n\nResearchers at [Brigham Young University](/wiki/Brigham_Young_University\n\"Brigham Young University\"), [Stanford](/wiki/Stanford \"Stanford\") and\n[Northwestern University](/wiki/Northwestern_University \"Northwestern\nUniversity\") demonstrated that social outsiders, similar to Dwight's\ncharacter, lead to better group decision making.
