New music and lyrics\nwere matched to Black's video to make it appear as though she were singing\nabout [gang](/wiki/Gang \"Gang\") warfare. The \"Gang Fight\" YouTube video,\nreleased in March 2011, earned BLR a million hits and thousands of\nsubscribers.[1]\n\nMore spoof videos followed, including interpretations of [The Black Eyed\nPeas](/wiki/The_Black_Eyed_Peas \"The Black Eyed Peas\")' \"[Boom Boom\nPow](/wiki/Boom_Boom_Pow \"Boom Boom Pow\")\" (a [viral video](/wiki/Viral_video\n\"Viral video\")[4] called [\"Everybody\nPoops\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQTW7Pd1vqc)); [Taylor\nSwift](/wiki/Taylor_Swift \"Taylor Swift\")'s \"[Our\nSong](/wiki/Our_Song_\\(Taylor_Swift_song\\) \"Our Song \\(Taylor Swift song\\)\")\";\nand [Michael Bublé](/wiki/Michael_Bubl%C3%A9 \"Michael Bublé\")'s \"[Haven't Met\nYou Yet](/wiki/Haven%27t_Met_You_Yet \"Haven't Met You Yet\")\". The latter was\ntransformed into the \"[electronica](/wiki/Electronica \"Electronica\")-inspired\"\n[\"Russian Unicorn\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjaZNYSt7o0),[1] which\nBublé himself praised as his \"new favorite song\"[5] and \"one of the coolest\nthings I've ever seen\".[6]\n\nIn September 2011, BLR branched out from pop singers to politicians with a\n\"bad lip-reading\" of Texas governor and US Presidential hopeful [Rick\nPerry](/wiki/Rick_Perry \"Rick Perry\"). BLR replaced clips of Perry with\ninvented dialogue matched to his lip movements. After airing on _[The Ellen\nDeGeneres Show](/wiki/The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\")_ ,\nthe video was featured by news and media outlets across the United States,\nleading to a sudden surge in Bad Lip Reading's popularity. Following the Perry\nspoof, BLR released bad lip-readings of [President Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama\n\"Barack Obama\"),[7] Republican presidential candidates [Michele\nBachmann](/wiki/Michele_Bachmann \"Michele Bachmann\"),[8] [Mitt\nRomney](/wiki/Mitt_Romney \"Mitt Romney\"), [Herman Cain](/wiki/Herman_Cain\n\"Herman Cain\"), [Ron Paul](/wiki/Ron_Paul \"Ron Paul\"), [Newt\nGingrich](/wiki/Newt_Gingrich \"Newt Gingrich\"), and [Rick\nSantorum](/wiki/Rick_Santorum \"Rick Santorum\").\n\nThe channel found even more success in November 2012 when it began overdubbing\npopular movie and television shows. BLR's version of\n_[Twilight](/wiki/Twilight_\\(2008_film\\) \"Twilight \\(2008 film\\)\")_ quickly\nwent viral, followed by parodies of _[The Hunger\nGames](/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_\\(film\\) \"The Hunger Games \\(film\\)\")_ ; _[The\nWalking Dead](/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Walking Dead \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ ; and _[Game of Thrones](/wiki/Game_of_Thrones \"Game of\nThrones\")_. The videos have been well-received not only by the public, but\nalso by the cast and creators of the properties being spoofed. In her [online\nblog](http://elizabethbanks.com/post/59512067649/a-bad-lip-reading-of-the-\nhunger-games), [Elizabeth Banks](/wiki/Elizabeth_Banks \"Elizabeth Banks\"),\n[Jennifer Lawrence](/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence \"Jennifer Lawrence\")'s co-star in\n_The Hunger Games_ , said, \"Bad Lip Reading is awesome. I was introduced to it\nby none other than Jennifer Lawrence. Yup — she saw this, people. And she\nlaughed. And so did I. A lot.\" Lawrence's co-star [Josh\nHutcherson](/wiki/Josh_Hutcherson \"Josh Hutcherson\") also praised the video,\ntweeting it to his fans. The cast and creators of _The Walking Dead_ have\npublicly praised the Bad Lip Reading \"Walking Dead\" videos on several\noccasions.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nExpanding his scope yet again, in January 2013 BLR released [a bad lip-\nreading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce-QT7MGSE) of [National Football\nLeague](/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\") players,\ncoaches, and referees, which would go on to become the channel's most popular\nvideo. A [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRqKYXcL-2U) NFL video\nfollowed in 2014,[9][10] and a\n[third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTRmyXX6ipU) was released in 2015.[11]\nThe NFL Bad Lip Reading video would go on to become an annual event for the\nchannel, with each video being released shortly before the Super Bowl each\nyear.\n\nIn December of 2015, Bad Lip Reading simultaneously released three new videos,\none for each of the three films in the original Star Wars trilogy. These\nvideos found BLR using guest voices for the first time, featuring [Jack\nBlack](/wiki/Jack_Black \"Jack Black\") as Darth Vader, [Maya\nRudolph](/wiki/Maya_Rudolph \"Maya Rudolph\") as Princess Leia, and [Bill\nHader](/wiki/Bill_Hader \"Bill Hader\") in multiple roles.[12] The _Empire\nStrikes Back_ BLR video featured a scene of Yoda singing to Luke about an\nunfortunate encounter with a seagull on the beach. BLR would later expand this\nscene into a full-length standalone song known as \"Seagulls! (Stop It Now)\",\nwhich was released in November 2016 (eventually hitting #1 on the Billboard\nComedy Digital Tracks chart[13].) As of late 2017, the \"Seagulls!\" video is\nBad Lip Reading's second most viewed YouTube upload, and most popular musical\nproduction. In the song, [Yoda](/wiki/Yoda \"Yoda\") sings to [Luke\nSkywalker](/wiki/Luke_Skywalker \"Luke Skywalker\") about the dangers posed by\nvicious seagulls if one dares to go to the beach. [Mark\nHamill](/wiki/Mark_Hamill \"Mark Hamill\"), who played Luke Skywalker in the\nStar Wars films, publicly praised \"Seagulls!\" (and Bad Lip Reading in general)\nwhile speaking at [Star Wars Celebration](/wiki/Star_Wars_Celebration \"Star\nWars Celebration\") in 2017: \"I love them, and I showed Carrie [Fisher] the\nYoda one… we were dying. I showed it to her in her trailer. She loved it. I\nretweeted it… and [BLR] contacted me and said ‘Do you want to do Bad Lip\nReading?’ And I said, ‘I’d love to…’”. Hamill and Bad Lip Reading would go on\nto collaborate on Bad Lip Reading's version of _The Force Awakens,_ with\nHamill providing the voice of Han Solo.[14]\n\nThe Star Wars Trilogy Bad Lip Reading videos also spawned a second musical\nnumber titled \"Bushes of Love\", which featured Ben Kenobi singing to Luke\nSkywalker about the perils of love. The song would hit #2 on the Billboard\nComedy Digital Tracks chart.[15] [Hamilton](/wiki/Hamilton_\\(musical\\)\n\"Hamilton \\(musical\\)\") creator and star [Lin-Manuel Miranda](/wiki/Lin-\nManuel_Miranda \"Lin-Manuel Miranda\") described the song as \"THE summer jam of\n2017\".[16]\n\nIn January 2017, BLR released a Bad Lip Reading of Donald Trump's\ninauguration, which quickly went viral, amassing over 36 million views in 2017\nalone. YouTube would rank the video at #7 on its list of the Top Ten Trending\nVideos of 2017.[17]\n\nIn a _Rolling Stone_ interview, the producer behind the Bad Lip Reading videos\nsaid that he first encountered the technique of [lip\nreading](/wiki/Lip_reading \"Lip reading\") when his mother, then in her 40s,\nlost her hearing due to unknown causes. While she excelled at lip reading, he\nwas unable to pick up the skill despite trying: \"I was terrible at it.\"[1]\n\nIn 2013, Bad Lip Reading won the [Webby Awards](/wiki/Webby_Awards \"Webby\nAwards\")' People's Voice Award for \"Comedy: Long Form or Series\". In April\n2014, BLR won the [American Comedy Award](/wiki/American_Comedy_Awards\n\"American Comedy Awards\") for Best Viral Video for its \"NFL: A Bad Lip\nReading\" video. [Patrick Stewart](/wiki/Patrick_Stewart \"Patrick Stewart\")\naccepted the award on BLR's behalf during the televised ceremony on NBC.\n\nOn June 8, 2014 the BLR Facebook page announced the release of the full\nversion of \"Modify\" by Kniles, a song that has been used in multiple BLR\nproductions. The fact that this song was used without previous attribution, as\nwell as stylistic similarities to other BLR-produced songs, have prompted\nspeculation that Kniles is another pseudonym for the individual behind Bad Lip\nReading.[18]\n\nA Bad Lip Reading of the [Disney Channel original\nmovie](/wiki/List_of_Disney_Channel_original_movies \"List of Disney Channel\noriginal movies\") _[High School Musical](/wiki/High_School_Musical \"High\nSchool Musical\")_ premiered as a half-hour special on July 11, 2016 on [Disney\nXD](/wiki/Disney_XD \"Disney XD\").\n\n## Copyright\ndispute[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bad_Lip_Reading&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Copyright dispute\")]\n\nOne of Bad Lip Reading's works, \"Dirty Spaceman\", a redubbing of \"[Check It\nOut](/wiki/Check_It_Out_\\(will.i.am_and_Nicki_Minaj_song\\) \"Check It Out\n\\(will.i.am and Nicki Minaj song\\)\")\" by [Will.i.am](/wiki/Will.i.am\n\"Will.i.am\") featuring [Nicki Minaj](/wiki/Nicki_Minaj \"Nicki Minaj\"), was\ntaken down due to a claim of copyright infringement.

Unlike \"Dirty Spaceman\", the claim was soon released, and the video was\nreturned. Likewise, \"Gang Fight\" was taken down in 2011, but returned. UMG has\nalso taken down \"Rockin' All Nite Long\", the [Taylor Swift](/wiki/Taylor_Swift\n\"Taylor Swift\") spoof that also features [Wiz Khalifa](/wiki/Wiz_Khalifa \"Wiz\nKhalifa\").\n\n## Videos[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bad_Lip_Reading&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Videos\")]\n\n### Based on\nsongs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bad_Lip_Reading&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Based on songs\")]\n\nArtist | Featuring | Original song(s) | Release date(s) | BLR song | Upload date  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n[Rebecca Black](/wiki/Rebecca_Black \"Rebecca Black\") |  | \"[Friday](/wiki/Friday_\\(Rebecca_Black_song\\) \"Friday \\(Rebecca Black song\\)\")\" | Mar 14, 2011 | \"Gang Fight\" | Mar 21, 2011  \n[Justin Bieber](/wiki/Justin_Bieber \"Justin Bieber\") | [Rascal Flatts](/wiki/Rascal_Flatts \"Rascal Flatts\") | \"[That Should Be Me](/wiki/That_Should_Be_Me \"That Should Be Me\")\" | Mar 19, 2010 | \"Asian Baby\" | Mar 24, 2011  \n[Black Eyed Peas](/wiki/Black_Eyed_Peas \"Black Eyed Peas\") |  | \"[Boom Boom Pow](/wiki/Boom_Boom_Pow \"Boom Boom Pow\")\" | Mar 30, 2009 | \"Everybody Poops\" | Mar 29, 2011  \n[Miley Cyrus](/wiki/Miley_Cyrus \"Miley Cyrus\") | [Snoop Dogg](/wiki/Snoop_Dogg \"Snoop Dogg\") | \"[Party in the U.S.A.](/wiki/Party_in_the_U.S.A. \"Party in the U.S.A.\")\", \"[Boom](/wiki/Boom_\\(Snoop_Dogg_song\\) \"Boom \\(Snoop Dogg song\\)\")\" | Aug 11, 2009;
