The\nPatriots defeated the Panthers by the score of 32-29. The game was played at\n[Reliant Stadium](/wiki/NRG_Stadium \"NRG Stadium\") in [Houston,\nTexas](/wiki/Houston \"Houston\"), on Sunday, February 1, 2004. At the time,\nthis was the most watched Super Bowl ever with 144.4 million viewers.[5]\n\nThe Panthers were making their first ever Super Bowl appearance after posting\nan 11–5 regular season record. They also made it the second straight year that\na team from the [NFC South](/wiki/NFC_South \"NFC South\") division made the\n[Super Bowl](/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\"), with the [Tampa Bay\nBuccaneers](/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\") winning [Super\nBowl XXXVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVII \"Super Bowl XXXVII\"). The Patriots were\nseeking their second Super Bowl title in three years after posting a 14–2\nrecord.\n\nNFL fans and sports writers widely consider this game one of the most well-\nplayed and thrilling Super Bowls; _[Sports\nIllustrated](/wiki/Sports_Illustrated \"Sports Illustrated\")_ writer [Peter\nKing](/wiki/Peter_King_\\(sportswriter\\) \"Peter King \\(sportswriter\\)\") hailed\nit as the \"Greatest Super Bowl of all time.\"[6] Although neither team could\nscore in the first and third quarters, they ended up with a combined total of\n868 yards and 61 points. The game was scoreless for a Super Bowl record 26:55\nbefore the two teams combined for 24 points prior to halftime. The clubs then\ncombined for a Super Bowl record 37 points in the fourth quarter. The contest\nwas finally decided when the Patriots kicker [Adam\nVinatieri](/wiki/Adam_Vinatieri \"Adam Vinatieri\")'s 41-yard field goal was\nmade with four seconds left. Patriots quarterback [Tom Brady](/wiki/Tom_Brady\n\"Tom Brady\") was named [Super Bowl MVP](/wiki/Super_Bowl_MVP \"Super Bowl MVP\")\nfor the second time in his career.\n\nThe game is also known for [its controversial halftime\nshow](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime-show_controversy \"Super Bowl XXXVIII\nhalftime-show controversy\") in which [Janet Jackson](/wiki/Janet_Jackson\n\"Janet Jackson\")'s breast, adorned with a [nipple\nshield](/wiki/Nipple_shield_\\(jewelry\\) \"Nipple shield \\(jewelry\\)\"), was\nexposed by [Justin Timberlake](/wiki/Justin_Timberlake \"Justin Timberlake\")\nfor about half a second, in what was later referred to as a \"[wardrobe\nmalfunction](/wiki/Wardrobe_malfunction \"Wardrobe malfunction\")\".[7] Along\nwith the rest of the halftime show, it led to an immediate crackdown by the\n[Federal Communications Commission](/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission\n\"Federal Communications Commission\") (FCC), and widespread debate on perceived\nindecency in broadcasting.[7]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n    * 1.1 The Panthers go from 1–15 to the Super Bowl\n    * 1.2 The Patriots go for two out of three\n    * 1.3 Common opponents of both teams\n    * 1.4 Playoffs\n  * 2 Broadcasting and entertainment\n    * 2.1 Pregame ceremonies\n    * 2.2 Halftime show\n  * 3 Game summary\n    * 3.1 First Quarter\n    * 3.2 Second Quarter\n    * 3.3 Third Quarter\n    * 3.4 Fourth Quarter\n    * 3.5 Box score\n    * 3.6 Statistical overview\n  * 4 Final statistics\n    * 4.1 Statistical comparison\n    * 4.2 Individual statistics\n  * 5 Starting lineups\n  * 6 Gambling\n  * 7 Officials\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XXXVIII&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nNFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XXXVIII to Houston during their November\n1, 2000 meeting held in Atlanta. This was the first Super Bowl to be played in\na stadium with a retractable roof (but it was eventually closed during the\ngame). It also marked the first time in 4 tries that the Patriots played a\nSuper Bowl that was not in New Orleans. This game marked a six-month stretch\nfor Texas hosting the Super Bowl, [NCAA men's Division I basketball Final\nFour](/wiki/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship \"NCAA Men's\nDivision I Basketball Championship\") and [Major League\nBaseball](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball \"Major League Baseball\") (MLB) [All-Star\nGame](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game \"Major League Baseball All-\nStar Game\"). The [Final\nFour](/wiki/2004_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament#Final_four_2\n\"2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament\") was played at the\n[Alamodome](/wiki/Alamodome \"Alamodome\") in San Antonio and the [MLB All-Star\nGame](/wiki/2004_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game \"2004 Major League\nBaseball All-Star Game\") was also played in Houston at nearby [Minute Maid\nPark](/wiki/Minute_Maid_Park \"Minute Maid Park\").\n\nBeginning with this game, all Super Bowl games have been played on the first\nSunday in February every year. This is based on the 22 weeks necessary from\nopening week through Super Bowl Sunday, which includes scheduling no games\nuntil after Labor Day, granting a bye week to each team during the sixteen-\ngame season, and granting a bye week to the teams qualifying for the Super\nBowl after each wins their respective conference championship game.\nConsequently, the Super Bowl is currently scheduled no earlier than February 1\nand no later than February 7.\n\nThis game set the record for most [Roman numerals](/wiki/Roman_numerals \"Roman\nnumerals\") in a Super Bowl title (seven). This will not be matched until Super\nBowl LXXVIII after the 2043 NFL season and Super Bowl LXXXVII after the 2052\nseason, and not surpassed until Super Bowl LXXXVIII after the 2053 season.\n\n### The Panthers go from 1–15 to the Super\nBowl[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XXXVIII&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: The Panthers go from 1–15 to the Super Bowl\")]\n\nMain article: [2003 Carolina Panthers\nseason](/wiki/2003_Carolina_Panthers_season \"2003 Carolina Panthers season\")\n\nThe Panthers made their first trip to the Super Bowl after posting a [one-win\nregular season just two years earlier](/wiki/2001_Carolina_Panthers_season\n\"2001 Carolina Panthers season\"). The franchise was only in their ninth year\nof existence, joining the league as an [expansion team](/wiki/Expansion_team\n\"Expansion team\") in [1995](/wiki/1995_NFL_season \"1995 NFL season\"). In just\ntheir second season, they posted a 12–4 regular season record and advanced to\nthe NFC Championship Game, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion [Green\nBay Packers](/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers \"Green Bay Packers\") 30–13 (the Packers\ncoincidentally went on to defeat the Patriots in [Super Bowl\nXXXI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXI \"Super Bowl XXXI\") 35–21). But from\n[1997](/wiki/1997_NFL_season \"1997 NFL season\") onward, they had just one non-\nlosing season (an 8–8 finish in [1999](/wiki/1999_NFL_season \"1999 NFL\nseason\")) until they finally suffered through a franchise worst 1–15 record in\n[2001](/wiki/2001_NFL_season \"2001 NFL season\"), winning only the first game\nof the regular season against the Minnesota Vikings. After that year, head\ncoach [George Seifert](/wiki/George_Seifert \"George Seifert\") was relieved of\nhis duties and replaced by [John Fox](/wiki/John_Fox_\\(NFL\\) \"John Fox\n\\(NFL\\)\"), former defensive coordinator for the [New York\nGiants](/wiki/New_York_Giants \"New York Giants\") who helped lead the Giants to\n[Super Bowl XXXV](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXV \"Super Bowl XXXV\") in\n[2000](/wiki/2000_NFL_season \"2000 NFL season\").\n\nWith John Fox at the helm and the team taking advantage of the [free\nagent](/wiki/Free_agent \"Free agent\") market and the [salary\ncap](/wiki/Salary_cap \"Salary cap\") rules, the Panthers improved in\n[2002](/wiki/2002_NFL_season \"2002 NFL season\"), finishing with a 7–9 record.\nThen in 2003, they recorded an 11–5 record and won the [NFC\nSouth](/wiki/NFC_South \"NFC South\").\n\nOne of the free agents that Carolina signed before the 2003 season was\nquarterback [Jake Delhomme](/wiki/Jake_Delhomme \"Jake Delhomme\"). Delhomme was\nnot picked by any team in the [NFL Draft](/wiki/NFL_Draft \"NFL Draft\"), but\nlater joined the [New Orleans Saints](/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints \"New Orleans\nSaints\") as an undrafted free agent in [1998](/wiki/1998_NFL_season \"1998 NFL\nseason\"). Delhomme also then played for the [NFL Europe](/wiki/NFL_Europe \"NFL\nEurope\")'s [Frankfurt Galaxy](/wiki/Frankfurt_Galaxy \"Frankfurt Galaxy\") in\n1999, and along with Pat Barnes, he was part of the \"double-headed quarterback\nmonster\" that led the Galaxy to a [World Bowl](/wiki/World_Bowl \"World Bowl\")\nvictory over the [Barcelona Dragons](/wiki/Barcelona_Dragons \"Barcelona\nDragons\").\n\nAlthough he only played 6 games in his 5 seasons with New Orleans, the\nPanthers signed Delhomme in 2003 to be the backup to starting quarterback\n[Rodney Peete](/wiki/Rodney_Peete \"Rodney Peete\"). However, after the Panthers\nfell to a 17–0 third quarter deficit in their first game of the season against\nthe [Jacksonville Jaguars](/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars \"Jacksonville Jaguars\"),\ngaining only one first down and 36 offensive yards, Fox immediately replaced\nPeete with Delhomme. Delhomme ended up leading Carolina to a 24–23 comeback\nvictory over the Jaguars.\n\nDelhomme became the team's starting quarterback for the rest of the season,\nthrowing for 3,219 yards and 19 touchdowns, with 16 interceptions. The team's\nmain receiving threat was multi-talented third-year wide receiver [Steve\nSmith](/wiki/Steve_Smith_Sr. \"Steve Smith Sr.\"), who also specialized as a\nkickoff and punt returner. Smith caught 88 passes for 1,110 yards and 7\ntouchdowns, rushed for 42 yards, gained 439 yards and another touchdown\nreturning punts, and recorded 309 kickoff return yards. Wide receiver [Muhsin\nMuhammad](/wiki/Muhsin_Muhammad \"Muhsin Muhammad\") was also a constant\nbreakaway threat, recording 54 receptions for 837 yards and 3 touchdowns.\n\nHowever, the Panthers' strength on offense was their running game, led by\nrunning backs [Stephen Davis](/wiki/Stephen_Davis_\\(American_football\\)\n\"Stephen Davis \\(American football\\)\") and [DeShaun\nFoster](/wiki/DeShaun_Foster \"DeShaun Foster\"). Davis was the team's leading\nrusher with a franchise record 1,444 yards and 8 touchdowns, while Foster\nrushed for 429 yards and caught 26 passes for 207 yards. Carolina also had\nrunning back [Rod Smart](/wiki/Rod_Smart \"Rod Smart\") on their roster, who\nbecame widely known for his [XFL](/wiki/XFL \"XFL\") debut jersey name \"He Hate\nMe\" during that league's only season in 2001. During 2003, Smart was primarily\nused as the Panthers' other kickoff returner, recording 947 yards and one\ntouchdown.\n\nOn defense, Carolina's main strength was their defensive line, anchored by\ndefensive ends [Julius Peppers](/wiki/Julius_Peppers \"Julius Peppers\") (7\nsacks and 3 forced fumbles) and [Mike Rucker](/wiki/Mike_Rucker \"Mike Rucker\")\n(12 sacks and 1 interception), and [Pro Bowl](/wiki/Pro_Bowl \"Pro Bowl\")\ndefensive tackle [Kris Jenkins](/wiki/Kris_Jenkins \"Kris Jenkins\") (5 sacks\nand 1 fumble recovery). The secondary was led by defensive backs [Reggie\nHoward](/wiki/Reggie_Howard \"Reggie Howard\") (2 interceptions), [Mike\nMinter](/wiki/Mike_Minter \"Mike Minter\") (3 interceptions for 100 return yards\nand 2 touchdowns), [Deon Grant](/wiki/Deon_Grant \"Deon Grant\") (3\ninterceptions), and [Ricky Manning Jr.](/wiki/Ricky_Manning_Jr. \"Ricky Manning\nJr.\") (3 interceptions for 33 return yards and 1 touchdown).\n\n### The Patriots go for two out of\nthree[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XXXVIII&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: The Patriots go for two out of three\")]\n\nMain article: [2003 New England Patriots\nseason](/wiki/2003_New_England_Patriots_season \"2003 New England Patriots\nseason\")\n\nDespite their victory in [Super Bowl XXXVI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVI \"Super Bowl\nXXXVI\") after the [2001 season](/wiki/2001_NFL_season \"2001 NFL season\"), the\nPatriots stumbled early in the [2002 season](/wiki/2002_NFL_season \"2002 NFL\nseason\"), recorded a 9–7 regular season record, and failed to make the\nplayoffs.\n\nThen, New England seemed to implode before the 2003 season ever started. Five\ndays before their opening game against the [Buffalo\nBills](/wiki/2003_Buffalo_Bills_season \"2003 Buffalo Bills season\"), Pro Bowl\nsafety [Lawyer Milloy](/wiki/Lawyer_Milloy \"Lawyer Milloy\"), one of the\nPatriots' defensive leaders, was unexpectedly cut by the team after refusing\nto restructure his contract. The move devastated many of the New England\nplayers, while Milloy immediately signed with the Bills two days later. With\nthe Patriots seemingly in emotional disarray, Buffalo defeated New England,\n31–0, with Milloy forcing an interception and recording one sack and five\ntackles.\n\nHowever, after a 2–2 start, the Patriots ended up winning their last 12 games\n(including a mirror 31–0 shutout of the Bills in the final week) to earn a\nleague-best 14–2 record.\n\n[Tom Brady](/wiki/Tom_Brady \"Tom Brady\"), the Super Bowl XXXVI\n[MVP](/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award \"Super Bowl Most Valuable\nPlayer Award\"), had become the team's permanent starter in 2002 after\nquarterback [Drew Bledsoe](/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe \"Drew Bledsoe\") left the team to\nlead the Bills. Brady had a solid season in 2003, completing 317 out of 527\n(60.2 percent) of his passes for 3,620 yards and 23 touchdowns, with only 12\ninterceptions. His primary weapon was second year wide receiver [Deion\nBranch](/wiki/Deion_Branch \"Deion Branch\"), who caught 57 passes for 803\nyards. Another key contributor was wide receiver [David\nGivens](/wiki/David_Givens \"David Givens\"), who filled in for the injured\nstarter [David Patten](/wiki/David_Patten \"David Patten\"). Givens recorded 34\nreceptions for 510 yards and 6 touchdowns. Other weapons in the passing game\nincluded veteran wide receiver [Troy Brown](/wiki/Troy_Brown \"Troy Brown\"),\nwho had 40 receptions, 472 yards, 4 touchdowns, and 293 yards returning punts,\nand tight end [Daniel Graham](/wiki/Daniel_Graham \"Daniel Graham\") who\nrecorded 28 catches, 409 yards, and 4 touchdowns.\n\nIn the backfield, the team's rushing game was led by running backs [Antowain\nSmith](/wiki/Antowain_Smith \"Antowain Smith\") and [Kevin\nFaulk](/wiki/Kevin_Faulk \"Kevin Faulk\"), who carried the ball equally. Smith\nwas the team's leading rusher with 642 yards and 3 touchdowns, while Faulk\nrushed for 638 yards and caught 48 passes for 440 yards.\n\nNew England's defense was retooled before the 2003 season when the team signed\nveteran safety [Rodney Harrison](/wiki/Rodney_Harrison \"Rodney Harrison\") as a\nfree agent and traded for defensive lineman [Ted\nWashington](/wiki/Ted_Washington \"Ted Washington\"). With these additions, the\nPatriots led the league in fewest passing yards allowed per attempt (5.64),\nfewest passing touchdowns allowed (11), and most interceptions (29). They also\nranked 4th in fewest rushing yards allowed (1,434) and 7th in fewest total\nyards (4,919).\n\nWashington helped anchor New England's defensive line, recording 32 tackles\nand 2 sacks. Pro Bowl defensive tackle [Richard Seymour](/wiki/Richard_Seymour\n\"Richard Seymour\") also contributed with 8 sacks. Behind them, the Patriots\nhad 3 outstanding linebackers: Pro Bowl linebacker [Willie\nMcGinest](/wiki/Willie_McGinest \"Willie McGinest\") (5.5 sacks, 2 fumble\nrecoveries and 1 interception), [Mike Vrabel](/wiki/Mike_Vrabel \"Mike Vrabel\")\n(9.5 sacks, 1 fumble recovery, four forced fumbles, and 2 interceptions), and\n[Tedy Bruschi](/wiki/Tedy_Bruschi \"Tedy Bruschi\") (131 tackles, 2 sacks, 1\nfumble recovery, 3 interceptions, and 2 touchdowns).\n\nHarrison became the veteran leader in the secondary, recording 92 tackles, 3\ninterceptions, and 3 sacks. Meanwhile, Pro Bowl cornerback [Ty\nLaw](/wiki/Ty_Law \"Ty Law\") recorded 6 interceptions, cornerback (and ex-\nPanthers player) [Tyrone Poole](/wiki/Tyrone_Poole \"Tyrone Poole\") had 6\ninterceptions for 112 return yards and 1 touchdown, and rookie safety [Eugene\nWilson](/wiki/Eugene_Wilson_\\(football\\) \"Eugene Wilson \\(football\\)\")\nrecorded 4 interceptions. Overall, the secondary combined for 19\ninterceptions.\n\n### Common opponents of both\nteams[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XXXVIII&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Common opponents of both teams\")]\n\nThe Patriots and Panthers both played against the [AFC South](/wiki/AFC_South\n\"AFC South\") and [NFC East](/wiki/NFC_East \"NFC East\") in the regular season.\nThe Patriots lost to the [Washington\nRedskins](/wiki/2003_Washington_Redskins_season \"2003 Washington Redskins\nseason\") 20–17 in Week Four but swept the rest of the NFC East and the entire\nAFC South; the Patriots shut out [Dallas](/wiki/2003_Dallas_Cowboys_season\n\"2003 Dallas Cowboys season\") in bitter cold and edged [the\nGiants](/wiki/2003_New_York_Giants_season \"2003 New York Giants season\") in\nthe rain while hammering [Philly](/wiki/2003_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2003\nPhiladelphia Eagles season\") following the infamously erroneous \"They hate\ntheir coach\" quote from [Tom Jackson](/wiki/Tom_Jackson_\\(American_football\\)\n\"Tom Jackson \\(American football\\)\"); the Patriots also edged [the\nTitans](/wiki/2003_Tennessee_Titans_season \"2003 Tennessee Titans season\"),\n[Houston](/wiki/2003_Houston_Texans_season \"2003 Houston Texans season\") in\novertime, and [former division rival\nIndianapolis](/wiki/2003_Indianapolis_Colts_season \"2003 Indianapolis Colts\nseason\") in shootouts while routing\n[Jacksonville](/wiki/2003_Jacksonville_Jaguars_season \"2003 Jacksonville\nJaguars season\") (which, like Carolina, had entered the NFL in\n[1995](/wiki/1995_Jacksonville_Jaguars_season \"1995 Jacksonville Jaguars\nseason\")) in the regular season, and then edged the Titans and hammered the\nColts in the playoffs. The Panthers had less success, going 6–4 against the\ntwo divisions, losing to the Titans and Houston while defeating Jacksonville\nand the Colts, and defeating Washington and the Giants while losing to\nPhiladelphia and Dallas in the regular season, then routing the Cowboys and\nedging the Eagles in the playoffs.\n\n  * **Scores of games against common opponents -**\n\nVS.

The [St.\nLouis Rams](/wiki/2003_St._Louis_Rams_season \"2003 St. Louis Rams season\") and\nthe [Philadelphia Eagles](/wiki/2003_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2003\nPhiladelphia Eagles season\") had better regular season records at 12–4, and\nthus under the playoff format, each would have to win two playoff games to\nreach the league championship game.

Both teams spent the\nrest of the second and the third quarter exchanging field goals before Brad\nHoover's 7-yard rushing touchdown gave the Panthers a 23–12 fourth quarter\nlead. However, the Rams rallied back with a touchdown, a successful [two-point\nconversion](/wiki/Two-point_conversion \"Two-point conversion\"), and a field\ngoal to send the game into overtime. Both teams missed field goals in the\nfirst overtime period, but Delhomme threw a 69-yard touchdown pass to Smith on\nthe first play of the second overtime period to win the game.\n\nThe Panthers then went on the road again to eliminate the Eagles in the [NFC\nChampionship Game](/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game \"NFC Championship Game\"), 14–3.\nPhiladelphia was coming off of a 20–17 overtime win over the [Green Bay\nPackers](/wiki/2003_Green_Bay_Packers_season \"2003 Green Bay Packers season\"),\nthat included quarterback [Donovan McNabb](/wiki/Donovan_McNabb \"Donovan\nMcNabb\")'s 28-yard pass to [Freddie Mitchell](/wiki/Freddie_Mitchell \"Freddie\nMitchell\") on a famous play known as \"[4th and 26](/wiki/4th_and_26 \"4th and\n26\")\". This was the third consecutive NFC Championship Game appearance for\nPhiladelphia, and thus they were heavily favored to win. But Carolina's\ndefense only allowed a field goal and held McNabb to just 10 of 22 completions\nfor 100 yards. Ricky Manning also intercepted McNabb 3 times. Although\nCarolina's offense only scored 14 points, it was more than enough for the team\nto earn their first trip to the Super Bowl with a 14–3 win.\n\nThe Panthers became the first No. 3 seed to advance to the Super Bowl since\nthe league expanded to a 12-team playoff format in 1990. In doing so, they\nwere also the first division winner to advance to the league championship\nafter playing _three_ playoff games. All other instances up to this point\nwhere teams advanced to the Super Bowl after playing all three rounds of the\nplayoffs were [wild card](/wiki/Wild_card_\\(sports\\)#National_Football_League\n\"Wild card \\(sports\\)\") teams in Super Bowls [XV](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XV \"Super\nBowl XV\"), [XX](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XX \"Super Bowl XX\"),\n[XXVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXVII \"Super Bowl XXVII\"),\n[XXXII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXII \"Super Bowl XXXII\"),\n[XXXIV](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIV \"Super Bowl XXXIV\"), and\n[XXXV](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXV \"Super Bowl XXXV\").

The Colts, Cardinals, and the Giants in 2011, like\nthe Panthers, were division winners in those years (Although in the Colts\ncase, they played the No. 4 seeded [New England\nPatriots](/wiki/2006_New_England_Patriots_season \"2006 New England Patriots\nseason\") in the AFC Championship that year, ensuring at least the second\ndivision winner to play three rounds to make it to the Super Bowl.), and all\nbut the Cardinals went on to win it all. The Super Bowl would mark the third\ngame (out of four) of the playoffs in which Carolina scored 29 points.\n\nMeanwhile, the Patriots first defeated the [Tennessee\nTitans](/wiki/2003_Tennessee_Titans_season \"2003 Tennessee Titans season\"),\n17–14, in one of the coldest games in NFL history, with temperatures reaching\n4 °F (−15 °C). New England jumped to 14–7 lead in the first half with a\ntouchdown pass by Brady and a touchdown run from Smith. However, quarterback\n[Steve McNair](/wiki/Steve_McNair \"Steve McNair\")'s 11-yard touchdown pass to\nreceiver [Derrick Mason](/wiki/Derrick_Mason \"Derrick Mason\") tied the game in\nthe third period. With 4:06 remaining in the game, Patriots kicker [Adam\nVinatieri](/wiki/Adam_Vinatieri \"Adam Vinatieri\") made a 46-yard field goal to\ntake the lead. New England's defense later clinched a victory as they stopped\nthe Titans from scoring on fourth down on their last drive of the game.\n\nNew England then eliminated the [Indianapolis\nColts](/wiki/2003_Indianapolis_Colts_season \"2003 Indianapolis Colts season\"),\n24–14, in the [AFC Championship Game](/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game \"AFC\nChampionship Game\").

However, New England's defense dominated the\nColts, only allowing 14 points, intercepting 4 passes from Manning (3 of them\nby [Ty Law](/wiki/Ty_Law \"Ty Law\")), and forcing a safety. Although New\nEngland's offense only scored one touchdown, Vinatieri scored 5 field goals to\nmake up the difference.\n\n## Broadcasting and\nentertainment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XXXVIII&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Broadcasting and entertainment\")]\n\nThe game was broadcast on television in the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") by [CBS](/wiki/NFL_on_CBS \"NFL on\nCBS\"), with [Greg Gumbel](/wiki/Greg_Gumbel \"Greg Gumbel\") handling the [play-\nby-play](/wiki/Sports_commentary \"Sports commentary\") duties and [color\ncommentator](/wiki/Color_commentator \"Color commentator\") [Phil\nSimms](/wiki/Phil_Simms \"Phil Simms\") in the broadcast booth.

The show was produced by [Viacom](/wiki/Viacom \"Viacom\")'s\n[MTV](/wiki/MTV \"MTV\") and [CBS Sports](/wiki/CBS_Sports \"CBS Sports\"), and\nwas sponsored by [America Online](/wiki/America_Online \"America Online\")'s\nTopSpeed software for dial-up Internet service. The show was themed supposedly\naround MTV's [Choose or Lose](/wiki/MTV#Choose_or_Lose \"MTV\") vote\ncampaign,[11] however beyond some flag imagery, [Jessica\nSimpson](/wiki/Jessica_Simpson \"Jessica Simpson\")'s declaration that Houston\nshould \"Choose to Party!\" and a vague call to action for younger persons to\nvote in a celebrity montage the first minute of the program and an audio outro\nabout choices, the theme was not called out for the remainder of the show.[12]\n\nAfter a brief appearance by Simpson, the show began with a joint performance\nby marching bands the [Spirit of Houston](/wiki/Spirit_of_Houston \"Spirit of\nHouston\"), from the [University of Houston](/wiki/University_of_Houston\n\"University of Houston\"), and the \"[Ocean of Soul](/wiki/Ocean_of_Soul \"Ocean\nof Soul\")\" of [Texas Southern University](/wiki/Texas_Southern_University\n\"Texas Southern University\"). Next, [Janet Jackson](/wiki/Janet_Jackson \"Janet\nJackson\") made her first appearance, singing \"[All for\nYou](/wiki/All_for_You_\\(Janet_Jackson_song\\) \"All for You \\(Janet Jackson\nsong\\)\")\".

The performance\nfeatured many suggestive dance moves by both Timberlake and Jackson. As the\nsong reached the final line, \"I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this\nsong,\" Timberlake pulled off a part of Jackson's costume, revealing her outer\nright [breast](/wiki/Breast \"Breast\") (adorned with a large, sun-shaped\n[nipple shield](/wiki/Nipple_shield_\\(jewelry\\) \"Nipple shield \\(jewelry\\)\"),\na piece of [jewelery](/wiki/Jewelery \"Jewelery\") worn to accentuate the\nappearance of a [nipple piercing](/wiki/Nipple_piercing \"Nipple piercing\")).\nCBS quickly cut to an aerial view of the stadium, however the action was too\nlate to be effective.

Nearly\nninety percent of the first half and all of the third quarter were scoreless.\nTwenty-four points were scored in the last three minutes of the first half,\nand a record 37 points were scored in the fourth quarter.\n\n### First\nQuarter[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XXXVIII&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: First Quarter\")]\n\nMost of the first half was a defensive struggle, with neither team able to\nscore until late in the second quarter, despite several early scoring\nopportunities for New England. After Carolina was forced to punt on their\nopening drive, Patriots receiver [Troy Brown](/wiki/Troy_Brown \"Troy Brown\")\ngave his team great field position with a 28-yard return to the Panthers\n47-yard line. The Patriots subsequently marched to the 9-yard line, but\nCarolina kept them out of the end zone and [Adam\nVinatieri](/wiki/Adam_Vinatieri \"Adam Vinatieri\") missed a 31-yard field goal\nattempt. The Patriots forced Carolina to punt after 3 plays and again got the\nball with great field position, receiving [Todd\nSauerbrun](/wiki/Todd_Sauerbrun \"Todd Sauerbrun\")'s 40-yard punt at the\nPanthers 49-yard line. New England then drove to the 31-yard line, but on\nthird down, linebacker [Will Witherspoon](/wiki/Will_Witherspoon \"Will\nWitherspoon\") tackled Brown for a 10-yard loss on an end-around play, pushing\nthe Patriots out of field goal range.\n\n### Second\nQuarter[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XXXVIII&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Second Quarter\")]\n\nLater on, New England drove 57 yards to the Panthers 18-yard line with 6\nminutes left in the second quarter, but once again they failed to score as\nCarolina kept them out of the end zone and Vinatieri's 36-yard field goal\nattempt was blocked by Panthers defender [Shane Burton](/wiki/Shane_Burton\n\"Shane Burton\").\n\nMeanwhile, the Carolina offense was stymied by the New England defense, with\nquarterback [Jake Delhomme](/wiki/Jake_Delhomme \"Jake Delhomme\") completing\njust one out of his first nine passes, sacked three times, and fumbling once.\nThat fumble occurred 3 plays after Vinatieri's second missed field goal;\nDelhomme lost the ball while being sacked by linebacker [Mike\nVrabel](/wiki/Mike_Vrabel \"Mike Vrabel\"), and Patriots defensive tackle\n[Richard Seymour](/wiki/Richard_Seymour \"Richard Seymour\") recovered the ball\nat the Panthers 20-yard line; by this point of the game the Panthers had\nsuffered a net loss of nine yards on twenty offensive snaps.\n\nTwo plays later, New England faced a third down and 7, but quarterback [Tom\nBrady](/wiki/Tom_Brady \"Tom Brady\") scrambled 12 yards to the 5-yard line for\na first down. Then wide receiver [Deion Branch](/wiki/Deion_Branch \"Deion\nBranch\") caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Brady on the next play. The play\nwas a play-action fake to [Antowain Smith](/wiki/Antowain_Smith \"Antowain\nSmith\"). Carolina's [Dan Morgan](/wiki/Dan_Morgan \"Dan Morgan\") bit on the\nroute, causing the touchdown.\n\nBranch's touchdown came after 26:55 had elapsed in the game, setting the\nrecord for the longest amount of time a Super Bowl remained scoreless. The\nplay also suddenly set off a scoring explosion from both teams for the\nremainder of the first half.\n\nThe Panthers stormed down the field on their ensuing possession, driving 95\nyards in 8 plays, and tying the game on a 39-yard touchdown pass from Delhomme\nto wide receiver [Steve Smith](/wiki/Steve_Smith_Sr. \"Steve Smith Sr.\") with\njust 1:07 left in the half.\n\nThe Patriots immediately countered with a 6-play, 78-yard scoring drive of\ntheir own. Starting from their own 22-yard line, Brady completed a 12-yard\npass to wide receiver [David Givens](/wiki/David_Givens \"David Givens\"). Then\nafter throwing an incompletion, Brady completed a long pass to Branch, who\ncaught it at the Panthers 24-yard line in stride before being tackled at the\n14-yard line for a 52-yard gain. Three plays later, Givens caught a 5-yard\ntouchdown from Brady to give New England a 14–7 lead with only 18 seconds left\nin the half. The Patriots decided to [squib kick](/wiki/Squib_kick \"Squib\nkick\") the ensuing kickoff to prevent a long return, but their plan backfired\nas Carolina tight end [Kris Mangum](/wiki/Kris_Mangum \"Kris Mangum\") picked up\nthe ball at his own 35-yard line and returned it 12 yards to the 47. The\nPatriots expected a pass play from the Panthers, but instead running back\n[Stephen Davis](/wiki/Stephen_Davis_\\(American_football\\) \"Stephen Davis\n\\(American football\\)\") ran for 21 yards on the next play to set up kicker\n[John Kasay](/wiki/John_Kasay \"John Kasay\")'s 50-yard field goal as time\nexpired in the half, cutting Carolina's deficit to 14–10.\n\n### Third\nQuarter[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XXXVIII&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Third Quarter\")]\n\nThe third quarter was scoreless as each team exchanged punts twice. However,\nwith 3:57 left in the period, the Patriots put together a 71-yard, 8-play\nscoring drive, featuring tight end [Daniel Graham](/wiki/Daniel_Graham \"Daniel\nGraham\")'s 33-yard reception to advance to the Carolina 9-yard line.\n\n### Fourth\nQuarter[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XXXVIII&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Fourth Quarter\")]\n\nRunning back [Antowain Smith](/wiki/Antowain_Smith \"Antowain Smith\") then\ncapped off the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run on the second play on the\nfourth quarter to increase their lead, 21–10. This was the start of another\nscoring explosion, one that became one of the biggest explosions in Super Bowl\nhistory, with both teams scoring a combined 37 points in the last 15 minutes,\nthe most ever in a single quarter of a Super Bowl.\n\nDelhomme started out Carolina's ensuing drive with a 13-yard completion to\nwide receiver [Muhsin Muhammad](/wiki/Muhsin_Muhammad \"Muhsin Muhammad\").\nAfter committing a false start penalty on the next play, Delhomme completed a\npair of passes to Smith for gains of 18 and 22 yards. Running back [DeShaun\nFoster](/wiki/DeShaun_Foster \"DeShaun Foster\") then scored on a 33-yard\ntouchdown run, cutting the Panthers' deficit to 21–16 after Delhomme's 2-point\nconversion pass fell incomplete. The Patriots responded on their ensuing\npossession by driving all the way to Carolina's 9-yard line, but the drive\nended when Panthers defensive back [Reggie Howard](/wiki/Reggie_Howard \"Reggie\nHoward\") intercepted a third down pass from Brady in the end zone. Then on 3rd\ndown from his own 15-yard line, Delhomme threw for the longest play from\nscrimmage in Super Bowl history, an 85-yard touchdown completion to Muhammad.\nCarolina's 2-point conversion attempt failed again, but they took their first\nlead of the game, 22–21, with 6:53 remaining. It was the first time in Super\nBowl history a team down 10+ points during the 4th quarter had come back to\ntake the lead. Three other times teams have come back to tie the game; the\n[Tennessee Titans](/wiki/Tennessee_Titans \"Tennessee Titans\") against the Rams\nin [Super Bowl XXXIV](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIV \"Super Bowl XXXIV\"), the Rams\nagainst the Patriots in [Super Bowl XXXVI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVI \"Super Bowl\nXXXVI\"), and the Patriots against the Falcons in [Super Bowl\nLI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_LI \"Super Bowl LI\").\n\nHowever, New England retook the lead on their next drive, advancing 68 yards\nwith the aid of a pair of completions from Brady to Givens for gains of 18 and\n25 yards. Once again the Patriots were faced with third down and goal, but\nthis time they scored with Brady's 1-yard pass to Vrabel, who had lined up in\nan eligible tight end position. Then on a two-point conversion attempt,\nrunning back [Kevin Faulk](/wiki/Kevin_Faulk \"Kevin Faulk\") took a direct snap\nand ran into the end zone to make the score 29–22. Despite amassing over 1,000\ncombined yards, Faulk's two-point conversion constituted the only points he\nscored all season.\n\nThe Panthers countered on their next possession. Foster started the drive with\na 9-yard run and a 7-yard reception. After that, Delhomme completed a 19-yard\npass to Muhammad, followed by a 31-yard completion to receiver [Ricky\nProehl](/wiki/Ricky_Proehl \"Ricky Proehl\").

Kasay's\nensuing extra point tied the game, 29–29, with 1:08 to play in regulation and\nit appeared that the game would be the first Super Bowl ever to go into\novertime.\n\nHowever, Kasay kicked the ensuing kickoff out of bounds, giving New England\nthe ball on their own 40-yard line. Brady led the Patriots offense down the\nfield with a 13-yard pass to Brown on second down. An offensive pass\ninterference penalty on Brown pushed New England back to their own 43-yard\nline, but another 13-yard reception to Brown and a 4-yard pass to Graham\nbrought up a critical 3rd down and 3 from the Carolina 40-yard line. The\nPanthers defense could not prevent the Patriots from gaining the first down,\nas Brady completed a 17-yard pass to Branch. On the next play, Vinatieri\nkicked a 41-yard field goal to give New England the lead, 32–29, with four\nseconds left in the game. Carolina failed on their last chance, as [Rod\nSmart](/wiki/Rod_Smart \"Rod Smart\") went nowhere on the ensuing kickoff, and\nthe Patriots had won their second Super Bowl in three years.

The two teams\ncombined for 868 yards of total offense, the second-highest total in Super\nBowl history. Both starting quarterbacks threw for at least 300 yards for only\nthe second time in Super Bowl history, with [Dan Marino](/wiki/Dan_Marino \"Dan\nMarino\") and [Joe Montana](/wiki/Joe_Montana \"Joe Montana\") each passing for\nat least 300 yards in [Super Bowl XIX](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XIX \"Super Bowl XIX\").\nThis was also only the second Super Bowl to feature one 100-yard receiving\nperformance on each team, with Deion Branch and Muhsin Muhammad each reaching\n100 yards. [Andre Reed](/wiki/Andre_Reed \"Andre Reed\") and [Michael\nIrvin](/wiki/Michael_Irvin \"Michael Irvin\") first accomplished the feat in\n[Super Bowl XXVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXVII \"Super Bowl XXVII\").\n\nThe 37 total points scored in the 4th quarter were the most combined points in\na 4th quarter in a Super Bowl and the most in any quarter by two teams.\nWashington's 35 points in [Super Bowl XXII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXII \"Super Bowl\nXXII\") was the previous high for most combined points in a single quarter in a\nSuper Bowl. The fourth quarter was the second in Super Bowl history to have\nfive touchdowns scored in a single quarter, the first being when the Redskins\nhad five in Super Bowl XXII in the second quarter. It was also the first time\nin Super Bowl history that both teams would score at least two touchdowns in\nthe same quarter.\n\nDelhomme finished the game with 16 completions out of 33 attempts for 323\nyards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a passer rating of 113.6. He\nwas seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he\nlater commented: \"I wanted to catch up to the moment of what it feels like to\nbe on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side.

I want to get back there, but I want to get on the\nother side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just\nwant to get on the other side of that rope.

When I have a tough day, I’ll just think about\nthat feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper.\"[15]\n\nMuhsin Muhammad caught four passes for 140 yards, an average of 35 yards per\ncatch, and a touchdown. Steve Smith caught four passes for 80 yards and a\ntouchdown. He also returned a punt for two yards, and returned a kickoff for\n30 yards, giving him 112 total yards. Proehl caught four passes for 71 yards\nand a touchdown. Proehl joined [Jerry Rice](/wiki/Jerry_Rice \"Jerry Rice\") as\nonly two players to score touchdowns with two different teams in Super Bowls.\n\nTom Brady's 32 completions were the most in Super Bowl history. His 48\nattempts were the most for a winning quarterback. His 354 yards passing is now\nthe fifth best total in Super Bowl history. Brady's passer rating for this\ngame was 100.5.
