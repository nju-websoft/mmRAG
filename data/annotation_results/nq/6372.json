The screenplay was\nby [Stirling Silliphant](/wiki/Stirling_Silliphant \"Stirling Silliphant\").\n\nThe film won five [Academy Awards](/wiki/Academy_Awards \"Academy Awards\"),\nincluding the [1967](/wiki/40th_Academy_Awards \"40th Academy Awards\") awards\nfor [Best Picture](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture \"Academy Award for\nBest Picture\") and Rod Steiger for [Best\nActor](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor \"Academy Award for Best Actor\").\n\nThe film was followed by two [sequels](/wiki/Sequel \"Sequel\"), _[They Call Me\nMister Tibbs!](/wiki/They_Call_Me_Mister_Tibbs! \"They Call Me Mister Tibbs!\")_\nin 1970, and _[The Organization](/wiki/The_Organization_\\(film\\) \"The\nOrganization \\(film\\)\")_ in 1971. In 1988, it also became the basis of a\n[television series](/wiki/In_the_Heat_of_the_Night_\\(TV_series\\) \"In the Heat\nof the Night \\(TV series\\)\") adaptation of the same name.\n\nAlthough the film was set in the fictional Mississippi town of Sparta (with\nsupposedly no connection to the real [Sparta,\nMississippi](/wiki/Sparta,_Mississippi \"Sparta, Mississippi\")), most of the\nmovie was filmed in [Sparta, Illinois](/wiki/Sparta,_Illinois \"Sparta,\nIllinois\"), where many of the film's landmarks can still be seen.

One night, police officer Sam Wood discovers that Colbert has been\nmurdered.\n\nChief Gillespie leads the investigation. A doctor estimates that Colbert had\nbeen dead for a few hours. Wood finds a black man named [Virgil\nTibbs](/wiki/Virgil_Tibbs \"Virgil Tibbs\") at the train station and arrests\nhim. Gillespie quickly assumes that Tibbs is the culprit and tries to get\nTibbs to make a confession. However, he is embarrassed to learn that Tibbs is\na top homicide detective from [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia\n\"Philadelphia\"). Gillespie phones Tibbs' chief, who confirms this and\nrecommends that Tibbs should assist them. This idea does not appeal to\nGillespie or Tibbs, but they reluctantly agree.\n\nGillespie arrests another suspect, but Tibbs clears him. The victim's widow is\nfrustrated by the ineptitude of the local police and impressed by Tibbs. She\nthreatens to stop the construction of the factory unless Tibbs leads the\ninvestigation. Despite the rocky start, the two policemen begin to respect\neach other as they are forced to work together.\n\nTibbs initially suspects plantation owner Endicott, a racist who publicly\nopposes the new factory. When Tibbs attempts to interrogate Endicott, Endicott\nslaps him in the face and Tibbs slaps him back. Endicott sends a gang of\nhooligans after Tibbs. Gillespie rescues him from the fight and tells him to\nleave town for his safety, but Tibbs is convinced he can solve the case. He\nexamines Colbert's body and suggests the murder happened earlier than\ninitially thought. He examines Colbert's car and deduces that Colbert was\nmurdered elsewhere and the culprit moved the body. Tibbs asks Wood to retrace\nhis car patrol route on the night of the murder, and Gillespie joins them.\nWhen Tibbs notices that Wood has changed his route, Gillespie starts\nsuspecting Wood, though Tibbs hints there is another reason.\n\nGillespie discovers that Wood made a sizable deposit into his bank account the\nday after the murder while Purdy, a local, files charges against Wood for\ngetting his 16-year-old sister Delores pregnant. Gillespie arrests Wood,\ndespite Tibbs' protests, and Delores is interrogated. Purdy is offended that a\nblack man was present at the interrogation, and he gathers a mob to get\nrevenge. Tibbs reveals that the murder was committed at the site of the\nplanned factory and clears Wood. He also admits that he knew why Wood had\nchanged his route: Delores is an [exhibitionist](/wiki/Exhibitionism\n\"Exhibitionism\") and Wood has been spying on her.\n\nTibbs visits a [backstreet abortionist](/wiki/Backstreet_abortion \"Backstreet\nabortion\"), who reveals that someone paid for Delores to have an abortion.\nWhen Delores arrives, Tibbs follows her outside and is confronted by the\nmurderer, Ralph. Purdy's mob tracks down Tibbs and holds him at gunpoint; he\nresponds by proving that Ralph got Delores pregnant. Ralph shoots Purdy dead\nbefore Tibbs disarms him. Ralph is arrested (presumptively for both murders)\nand confesses to Colbert’s: he robbed Colbert to fund Delores's abortion but\naccidentally killed him.\n\nThe final scene shows Tibbs boarding a train bound for Philadelphia, as\nGillespie respectfully bids him farewell.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=In_the_Heat_of_the_Night_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Sidney Poitier](/wiki/Sidney_Poitier \"Sidney Poitier\") as [Virgil Tibbs](/wiki/Virgil_Tibbs \"Virgil Tibbs\")\n  * [Rod Steiger](/wiki/Rod_Steiger \"Rod Steiger\") as Gillespie\n  * [Warren Oates](/wiki/Warren_Oates \"Warren Oates\") as Sam Wood\n  * [Lee Grant](/wiki/Lee_Grant \"Lee Grant\") as Mrs. Colbert\n  * [Larry Gates](/wiki/Larry_Gates \"Larry Gates\") as Endicott\n  * [James Patterson](/wiki/James_Patterson_\\(actor\\) \"James Patterson \\(actor\\)\") as Mr. Purdy\n  * [William Schallert](/wiki/William_Schallert \"William Schallert\") as Mayor Schubert\n  * [Beah Richards](/wiki/Beah_Richards \"Beah Richards\") as Mama Caleba\n  * [Peter Whitney](/wiki/Peter_Whitney \"Peter Whitney\") as Courtney\n\n|\n\n  * [Kermit Murdock](/wiki/Kermit_Murdock \"Kermit Murdock\") as Henderson\n  * [Larry D.

However,\ndespite their reservations, Jewison decided to film part of the film in\n[Dyersburg](/wiki/Dyersburg,_Tennessee \"Dyersburg, Tennessee\") (Endicott's\nhouse) and [Union City](/wiki/Union_City,_Tennessee \"Union City, Tennessee\"),\nTennessee, anyway while the rest was filmed in Sparta,\n[Chester](/wiki/Chester,_Illinois \"Chester, Illinois\") (Harvey Oberst chase\nscene), and [Freeburg](/wiki/Freeburg,_Illinois \"Freeburg, Illinois\")\n(Compton's diner), Illinois.\n\nThe famous scene of Tibbs slapping Endicott is not present in the novel.\nAccording to Poitier, the scene was almost not in the movie. In the textbook\n\"Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to History),\"\nPoitier states: \"I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll make this movie for you if\nyou give me your absolute guarantee when he slaps me I slap him right back and\nyou guarantee that it will play in every version of this movie.' I try not to\ndo things that are against nature.\" [4] However, Poitier's version of the\nstory is contradicted by [Mark Harris](/wiki/Mark_Harris_\\(journalist\\) \"Mark\nHarris \\(journalist\\)\") in his book, _Pictures at a Revolution_. Harris states\nthat copies of the original draft of the screenplay that he obtained clearly\ncontain the scene as filmed, which is backed up by Jewison and Silliphant.\n\nThe film is also important for being the first major Hollywood film in color\nthat was lit with proper consideration for a black person. [Haskell\nWexler](/wiki/Haskell_Wexler \"Haskell Wexler\") recognized that standard strong\nlighting used in filming tended to produce too much glare on dark complexions\nand rendered the features indistinct. Accordingly, Wexler toned it down to\nfeature Poitier with better photographic results.[5]\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=In_the_Heat_of_the_Night_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nIn contrast to films like _[The Chase](/wiki/The_Chase_\\(1966_film\\) \"The\nChase \\(1966 film\\)\")_ and _[Hurry Sundown](/wiki/Hurry_Sundown_\\(film\\)\n\"Hurry Sundown \\(film\\)\")_ , which offered confused visions of the South, _In\nthe Heat of the Night_ offered a tough, edgy vision of a Southern town that\nseemed to hate outsiders more than itself, a theme reflecting the uncertain\nmood of the time as the [Civil Rights Movement](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement\n\"Civil Rights Movement\") attempted to take hold. Canadian director Jewison\nwanted to tell an anti-racist story of a white man and a black man working\ntogether in spite of difficulties. Jewison said that this film proved a\nconviction he had held for a long time: \"It's you against the world. It's like\ngoing to war. Everybody is trying to tell you something different and they are\nalways putting obstacles in your way.\"\n\nIn one famous scene, Gillespie mocks the name 'Virgil' by saying \"That's a\nfunny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia! What do they call\nyou up there?\" An irritated Tibbs replies: \"They call me Mr. Tibbs!\" The line\nwas later listed as number 16 on the [American Film\nInstitute](/wiki/American_Film_Institute \"American Film Institute\")'s _[100\nYears...100 Movie Quotes](/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movie_Quotes \"AFI's\n100 Years...100 Movie Quotes\")_ , a list of top film quotes, and was also the\ntitle of [the sequel](/wiki/They_Call_Me_Mister_Tibbs! \"They Call Me Mister\nTibbs!\"). An iconic scene that surprised and perhaps shocked audiences at the\ntime occurs when Tibbs is slapped by Endicott. Tibbs responds by slapping him\nback.\n\nIn a [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\") pre-screening,\nJewison was concerned when the young audience was laughing at the film as if\nit were a comedy. The audience's stunned reaction to the slapping scene\nconvinced Jewison that the film was effective as drama.[6] That scene helped\nmake the film so popular for audiences, finally seeing the top black film\nactor physically strike back against bigotry, that the film earned the\nnickname, _[Super-spade](/wiki/Superspade \"Superspade\") Versus the\nRednecks_.[7] During the film's initial run, Steiger and Poitier occasionally\nwent to the [Capitol Theatre](/wiki/Capitol_Theatre_\\(New_York_City\\) \"Capitol\nTheatre \\(New York City\\)\") in [New York](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\")\nto amuse themselves seeing how many black and white audience members there\nwere, which could be immediately ascertained by listening to the former\ncheering Tibbs's retaliatory slap and the latter whispering \"Oh!\" in\nastonishment.[8]\n\n### Critical\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=In_the_Heat_of_the_Night_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Critical response\")]\n\nThen-freshman critic [Roger Ebert](/wiki/Roger_Ebert \"Roger Ebert\") in 1967\ngave _In the Heat of the Night_ a positive review and placed it at number ten\non his top ten list of 1967 films.[9][10] AD Murphy of _[Variety\nmagazine](/wiki/Variety_magazine \"Variety magazine\")_ felt it was a good but\nuneven film.[11]\n\nWith the release of the film in the United States in August, Poitier was\nstarring in two movies simultaneously at the box office, as _[To Sir, with\nLove](/wiki/To_Sir,_with_Love \"To Sir, with Love\")_ had been released the\nprevious June.\n\nThe film, as of July 2017, holds a 96% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the [review\naggregate](/wiki/Review_aggregator \"Review aggregator\") website [Rotten\nTomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\"), out of 44 reviews\ncollected with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10.

Five Oscars include Best\nPicture...\"\n\n_Mick Martin 's & Marsha Porter's DVD & Video Guide_ (2007 edition) also puts\nits rating high, at 4 stars (out of 5), finding it \"[A] rousing murder mystery\nelevated by the excellent acting of Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier.\"\n\nBritish references likewise show high regard for the film, with [David\nShipman](/wiki/David_Shipman_\\(writer\\) \"David Shipman \\(writer\\)\") in his\n1984 _The Good Film and Video Guide_ giving 3 (out of 4) stars, noting that\n\"[A]s mystery or detective story this film is only fair but it has enormous\ntension. Within its given framework, it is good on the colour question. There\nis tension in the eyes of the black (Sidney Poitier), who happens to be a\nhomicide officer, and malevolence in those of the local police chief (Rod\nSteiger). These are two remarkable performances, well supported by Warren\nOates, Lee Grant and Larry Gates.\"\n\nAnother British film critic with a highly personal _Film Guide_ , [Leslie\nHalliwell](/wiki/Leslie_Halliwell \"Leslie Halliwell\"), gave 2 stars (out of 4)\ndescribing it in the 5th edition (1985) as an \"[O]verrated policier in which\nthe personality clash is amusing (and was timely) but the murder puzzle is a\ncomplete throwaway.\" The _Guide_ continued to be published after Halliwell's\ndeath in 1989 and, in the 21st edition, _Halliwell 's Film Video & DVD Guide\n2007_, John Walker, who took over as the _Guide 's_ author, raised the rating\nto the highest level of 4 stars and rewrote the evaluation to state that it is\n\"[A] tense and exciting thriller that also explores racism through the\nexplosive clash of two contrasting personalities.\"\n\n## Home\nmedia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=In_the_Heat_of_the_Night_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Home media\")]\n\n_In the Heat of the Night_ was first released on [DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") in\n2001.
