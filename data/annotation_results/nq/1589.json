In\n2004, the agency also began representing actors over seven feet (2.13 m) tall\nwho had suffered from being confined to \"niche\" roles. Over forty members of\nWillow Management were cast as goblins in _[Harry Potter and the Deathly\nHallows – Part 2](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_2\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\")_.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn April 2010, Davis published his [autobiography](/wiki/Autobiography\n\"Autobiography\"), _Size Matters Not: The Extraordinary Life and Career of\nWarwick Davis_ , with a foreword by [George Lucas](/wiki/George_Lucas \"George\nLucas\").[20]\n\nIn January 2013, he appeared in a [Comic Relief](/wiki/Comic_Relief \"Comic\nRelief\") episode of _[The Great British Bake\nOff](/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off \"The Great British Bake Off\")_ , winning\nthat episode's title of \"Comic Relief Star Baker\".[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nDavis is a founder of the Reduced Height Theatre Company, which stages\ntheatrical productions cast exclusively with short actors and using reduced\nheight sets.

He has said the only real\ndrawback to being small was the associated health problems. Of his own\ndwarfism, Davis has said, \"As you get older, you can suffer from painful hips,\nand our joints wear a lot quicker than for people of average\nheight.\"[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nDavis' wife, Samantha, has achondroplasia, and their two children also have\nSED.[26] Their daughter, [Annabelle Davis](/wiki/Annabelle_Davis \"Annabelle\nDavis\"), stars in the [CBBC](/wiki/CBBC \"CBBC\") show, _[The Dumping\nGround](/wiki/The_Dumping_Ground \"The Dumping Ground\")_ as Sasha Bellman. As a\nresult of having different causes of dwarfism, the couple's first two\nchildren, sons Lloyd and George, died shortly after birth, having had a fatal\ncombination of the conditions. Samantha is the daughter of Davis' business\npartner [Peter Burroughs](/wiki/Peter_Burroughs \"Peter Burroughs\") and the\nsister of actress Hayley Burroughs.
