The College Area is dominated by [San Diego State\nUniversity](/wiki/San_Diego_State_University \"San Diego State University\")\n(SDSU; once known as San Diego State College), after which the area is named.\nSeveral neighborhoods in the College Area were developed in the 1930s, with\nothers becoming established in the post-war period.[1] The College Area is\nbordered on the west by Kensington and Talmadge and on the east by the city of\nLa Mesa. El Cajon Boulevard is a busy shopping district; additional retail is\nin development near SDSU.\n\nThe College Area includes the neighborhoods of the Catoctin Area, Dennstedt\nPoint, East Falls View Drive, Saranac-Mohawk, and an [Orthodox\nJewish](/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism \"Orthodox Judaism\") neighborhood in the area\nnear Congregation Beth Jacob Orthodox Synagogue on College Avenue. The region\nincludes [Alvarado Hospital](/wiki/Alvarado_Hospital \"Alvarado Hospital\"), a\n306-bed acute care facility, and the College-Rolando branch of the [San Diego\nPublic Library](/wiki/San_Diego_Public_Library \"San Diego Public Library\").\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Geography\n  * 2 Transportation\n  * 3 Traffic\n  * 4 Education\n    * 4.1 Elementary schools\n    * 4.2 K through 8\n    * 4.3 K through 12\n    * 4.4 Colleges and universities\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n##\nGeography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Area,_San_Diego&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Geography\")]\n\nThe college area lies on a plateau which overlooks [Interstate\n8](/wiki/Interstate_8 \"Interstate 8\"). The neighborhood's borders are defined\nby Montezuma Road/Collwood Boulevard to the southwest, Interstate 8 to the\nnorth, 73rd Street to the east, and El Cajon Boulevard to the south.\n\n##\nTransportation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Area,_San_Diego&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Transportation\")]\n\nMTS (Metropolitan Transit System) operates the [San Diego\nTrolley](/wiki/San_Diego_Trolley \"San Diego Trolley\")[2] to [SDSU Transit\nCenter](/wiki/SDSU_Transit_Center_\\(MTS_Transit_Center\\) \"SDSU Transit Center\n\\(MTS Transit Center\\)\") and the [Alvarado Medical Center trolley\nstation](/wiki/Alvarado_Medical_Center_\\(San_Diego_Trolley_station\\) \"Alvarado\nMedical Center \\(San Diego Trolley station\\)\"), both of which are in the\nCollege Area. The trolley station at SDSU, as well as a bus plaza, make up the\nSDSU Transit Center. Bus routes 11, 11A, 14, 936, and Rapid Bus 215 go to the\nTransit Center, to name a few. Transfers are made from the SDSU trolley subway\nstation located at the Transit Center, underneath the bus plaza. Riders can go\nup to the bus plaza via elevator or stairs.\n\nAs of October 12, 2014, the SDSU Transit Station serves as the starting point\nfor MTS Rapid Bus Route 215. A high-frequency, limited-stop service runs\nbetween San Diego State University and Downtown San Diego via El Cajon\nBoulevard and Park Boulevard. This route provides a convenient transit option\nfor visitors and nearby neighbors from downtown San Diego, North Park and\nHillcrest to shop and dine in the busy commercial corridor.\n\nAll mass transit routes noted enable visitors from the San DIego region to\nexplore San Diego State University's beautiful campus and enjoy the leisure,\narts and culture provided by this institution of higher learning.\n\n##\nTraffic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Area,_San_Diego&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Traffic\")]\n\nThe College Area is accessible from Interstate 8, State Route 94. Surface\nstreets entering into the College Area include 70th Street (accessible from\nI-8), College Avenue (accessible from I-8 and SR94) and 54th Street and\nMontezuma Road (accessible from I-8). Built in July 2005 there is also a mass\ntransit connection by MTS San Diego Trolley accessing the SDSU on-campus\nunderground station. Traffic can be high during the day however, local\nresidents and City officials working together to increase pedestrian and\nbicycle routes and modifying the street infrastructure to eleviate any\ncongestion in the area as the population grows in the neighborhoods.\n\n##\nEducation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Area,_San_Diego&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Education\")]\n\nThe college area is home to one traditional elementary school, one private K-8\nschool, two alternative K-8 schools, and SDSU.\n\n###
