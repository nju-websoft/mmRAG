It was released on May 23, 2000. It was written by [Jon Bon\nJovi](/wiki/Jon_Bon_Jovi \"Jon Bon Jovi\"), [Richie\nSambora](/wiki/Richie_Sambora \"Richie Sambora\"), and [Max\nMartin](/wiki/Max_Martin \"Max Martin\").\n\nThe song charted in the top 10 across several countries (although it only\nreached number 33 in the US).[2] Though the band had moved away from the glam-\noriented sound with 1992's _[Keep the Faith](/wiki/Keep_the_Faith \"Keep the\nFaith\")_ , it has the distinction of making Bon Jovi one of the only bands\nonce classified as 1980s [glam metal](/wiki/Glam_metal \"Glam metal\") to reach\nthe top 40 in the 2000s, a testament to how the song managed to introduce the\nband to a new, younger fanbase. The song is arguably their most well known\npost-1980s hit single and it has been performed live at almost all shows since\nits release. This song appeared on [Mitsubishi Motors](/wiki/Mitsubishi_Motors\n\"Mitsubishi Motors\") promotional video in 2001-2004\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Response from fans\n  * 3 Music video\n  * 4 Track listings and versions\n  * 5 Official versions and remixes\n    * 5.1 Acoustic version\n  * 6 Awards\n  * 7 Charts and certifications\n    * 7.1 Weekly charts\n    * 7.2 Annual charts\n    * 7.3 Decade-end charts\n    * 7.4 All-time charts\n    * 7.5 Certifications\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_My_Life_\\(Bon_Jovi_song\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nThe song has many classic Bon Jovi features, such as Sambora's use of the\n[talk box](/wiki/Talk_box \"Talk box\"), and a line in the second\n[verse](/wiki/Verse_\\(popular_music\\) \"Verse \\(popular music\\)\") \"For Tommy\nand Gina, who never backed down\" refers to Tommy and Gina, a fictional\n[working class](/wiki/Working_class \"Working class\") couple that Bon Jovi and\nSambora first wrote about in their 1986 hit \"[Livin' on a\nPrayer](/wiki/Livin%27_on_a_Prayer \"Livin' on a Prayer\")\".\n\n\"It's My Life\" is also notable for its line referencing fellow New Jerseyan\n[Frank Sinatra](/wiki/Frank_Sinatra \"Frank Sinatra\"): \"My heart is like an\nopen highway / Like Frankie said / I did it '[My Way](/wiki/My_Way_\\(song\\)\n\"My Way \\(song\\)\")'.\" [Jon Bon Jovi](/wiki/Jon_Bon_Jovi \"Jon Bon Jovi\") and\n[Richie Sambora](/wiki/Richie_Sambora \"Richie Sambora\") apparently had a\ndisagreement over those lines, with Bon Jovi recalling:[3]\n\n> I had just come home from making _[U-571](/wiki/U-571_\\(film\\) \"U-571\n> \\(film\\)\")_ and I said \"Sinatra made 16 movies and toured 'til he was 80.\n> This is my role model\". He [Sambora] said, \"You can't write that damn lyric.\n> Nobody cares about Frank Sinatra but you.\" And I wrote it anyway.\n\n## Response from\nfans[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_My_Life_\\(Bon_Jovi_song\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Response from fans\")]\n\n\"Nobody had anticipated the song 'It's My Life',\" noted Jon Bon Jovi in 2007.\n\"Except us. We knew we had a hit.\"[4] The song became an anthem that appealed\nto many fans. As Bon Jovi later stated:[5]: \"I thought I was writing very\nself-indulgently about my own life and where I was in it. I didn't realize\nthat the phrase 'It's My Life' would be taken as being about everyone – by\nteenagers, by older guys, mechanics, whatever. 'It's my life, and I'm taking\ncontrol.' Everyone kind of feels that way from time to time.\"\n\n## Music\nvideo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_My_Life_\\(Bon_Jovi_song\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Music video\")]\n\nThe music video was directed by [Wayne Isham](/wiki/Wayne_Isham \"Wayne\nIsham\"). [Will Estes](/wiki/Will_Estes \"Will Estes\") (as Tommy) and [Shiri\nAppleby](/wiki/Shiri_Appleby \"Shiri Appleby\") (as Gina) are the two main\ncharacters. At the beginning, Tommy is watching a video of a Bon Jovi concert\non his computer when he is ordered by his mother to take out the trash.\nSuddenly, Gina calls, and Tommy starts running down to his apartment and\nobediently takes out the trash. He then runs through the streets of [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\") up to the concert, getting chased by\n[dogs](/wiki/Dog \"Dog\"), running a [marathon](/wiki/Marathon \"Marathon\"),\nposing for pictures, and jackknifing a truck. The video was inspired by the\nfilm, _[Run Lola Run](/wiki/Run_Lola_Run \"Run Lola Run\")_.[6] Jon Bon Jovi met\nWill Estes on the set of _U-571_ and chose him to be in the video. The music\nvideo features the [2nd Street Tunnel](/wiki/2nd_Street_Tunnel \"2nd Street\nTunnel\") as one of the main settings.\n\nIt is the most viewed video for Bon Jovi, with over 530 million views as of\nJanuary 2018.\n\n## Track listings and\nversions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_My_Life_\\(Bon_Jovi_song\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Track listings and versions\")]\n\nMajor formats released for \"It's My Life\":\n\nGerman CD Single Pt. 1 (562754)\n\n(Released: May 23, 2000)\n\n  1. \"It's My Life\" (Main version) — 3:46\n  2. \"Hush\" (Demo version) — 3:48\n  3. \"You Can't Lose at Love\" (Demo version) — 4:44\n  4. \"Someday I'll Be Saturday Night\" (Enhanced Video Clip)\n\n    \n\n    Recorded live at the Sanctuary II, New Jersey Web Concert on February 10, 1999.
