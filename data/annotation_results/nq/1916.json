Rice is India's pre-eminent crop, and is the staple food of\nthe people of the [eastern](/wiki/East_India \"East India\") and\n[southern](/wiki/Southern_India \"Southern India\") parts of the country.[1]\nProduction increased from 53.6 million tons in FY 1980 to 74.6 million tons in\nyear 1990, a 39 percent increase over the decade. By year 1992, rice\nproduction had reached 181.9 kg, second in the world only to\n[China](/wiki/China \"China\") with its 182 kg.[1] Since 1950 the increase has\nbeen more than 350 percent. Most of this increase was the result of an\nincrease in yields; the number of hectares increased only 0 percent during\nthis period. Yields increased from 1,336 kilograms per hectare in FY 1980 to\n1,751 kilograms per hectare in FY 1990. The per-hectare yield increased more\nthan 262 percent between 1950 and 1992.[1]\n\nThe country's rice production had declined to 89.14 million tonnes in 2009-10\ncrop year (July–June) from record 99.18 million tonnes in the previous year\ndue to severe drought that affected almost half of the country. India could\nachieve a record rice production of 100 million tonnes in 2010-11 crop year on\nthe back of better monsoon this year. The India's rice production reached to a\nrecord high of 104.32 million tonnes in 2011-2012 crop year (July–June). no\nrice no life so play freerice\n\n[Rice](/wiki/Rice \"Rice\") is one of the chief grains of India. Moreover, this\ncountry has the largest area under rice cultivation, as it is one of the\nprincipal food crops. It is in fact the dominant crop of the country.\n[India](/wiki/India \"India\") is one of the leading producers of this crop.\nRice is the basic food crop and being a tropical plant, it flourishes\ncomfortably in hot and humid climate. Rice is mainly grown in rain fed areas\nthat receive heavy annual rainfall. That is why it is fundamentally a kharif\ncrop in India. It demands temperature of around 25 degree Celsius and above\nand rainfall of more than 100 cm. Rice is also grown through irrigation in\nthose areas that receives comparatively less rainfall. Rice is the staple food\nof eastern and southern parts of India. In 2009-10, total rice production in\nIndia amounted to 89.13 million tonnes, which was much less than production of\nprevious year, 99.18 million tonnes.\n\n[Rice](/wiki/Rice \"Rice\") can be cultivated by different methods based on the\ntype of region. But in [India](/wiki/India \"India\"), the traditional methods\nare still in use for harvesting rice. The fields are initially ploughed and\nthen fertiliser is applied which typically consists of cow dung and then the\nfield is smoothed. The seeds are transplanted by hand and then through proper\n[irrigation](/wiki/Irrigation \"Irrigation\"), the seeds are cultivated. Rice\ngrows on a variety of soils like silts, loams and gravels. It can also\ntolerate [alkaline](/wiki/Alkaline \"Alkaline\") as well as [acid\nsoils](/wiki/Acid_soil \"Acid soil\"). However, clayey loam is well suited to\nthe raising of this crop. Actually the clayey soil can be easily converted\ninto mud in which rice seedlings can be transplanted easily. Proper care has\nto be taken as this crop thrives if the soil remains wet and is under water\nduring its growing years. Rice fields should be level and should have low mud\nwalls for retaining [water](/wiki/Water \"Water\"). In the plain areas, excess\n[rainwater](/wiki/Rainwater \"Rainwater\") is allowed to inundate the rice\nfields and flow slowly. Rice raised in the well watered lowland areas is known\nas lowland or wet rice. In the hilly areas, slopes are cut into terraces for\nthe cultivation of rice. Thus, the rice grown in the hilly areas is known as\ndry or upland rice. The yield of upland rice per hectare is comparatively less\nthan that of the wet rice.\n\nThe regions cultivating this crop in India is distinguished as the western\ncoastal strip, the eastern coastal strip, covering all the primary deltas,\n[Assam](/wiki/Assam \"Assam\") plains and surrounding low hills, foothills and\n[Terai region](/wiki/Terai_region \"Terai region\")\\- along the\n[Himalayas](/wiki/Himalaya \"Himalaya\") and states like [West\nBengal](/wiki/West_Bengal \"West Bengal\"), [Bihar](/wiki/Bihar \"Bihar\"),\neastern [Uttar Pradesh](/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh \"Uttar Pradesh\"), eastern [Madhya\nPradesh](/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh \"Madhya Pradesh\"), northern [Andhra\nPradesh](/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh \"Andhra Pradesh\") and\n[Odisha](/wiki/Odisha,_India \"Odisha, India\"). India, being a land of eternal\ngrowing season, and the deltas of [Kaveri River](/wiki/Kaveri_River \"Kaveri\nRiver\"), [Krishna River](/wiki/Krishna_River \"Krishna River\"), [Godavari\nRiver](/wiki/Godavari_River \"Godavari River\"), [Indravati\nRiver](/wiki/Indravati_River \"Indravati River\") and [Mahanadi\nRiver](/wiki/Mahanadi_River \"Mahanadi River\") with a thick set-up of canal\nirrigation like [Hirakud Dam](/wiki/Hirakud_Dam \"Hirakud Dam\") and [Indravati\nDam](/wiki/Indravati_Dam \"Indravati Dam\"), permits farmers to raise two, and\nin some pockets, even three crops a year. Irrigation has made even three crops\na year possible. [Irrigation](/wiki/Irrigation \"Irrigation\") has made it\nfeasible even for [Punjab](/wiki/Punjab,_India \"Punjab, India\") and\n[Haryana](/wiki/Haryana \"Haryana\"), known for their baked climate, to grow\n[rice](/wiki/Rice \"Rice\"). They even export their excess to other states.\nPunjab and Haryana grow prized rice for export purposes. The hilly terraced\nfields from [Kashmir](/wiki/Kashmir \"Kashmir\") to Assam are idyllically suited\nfor rice farming, with age-old hill irrigational conveniences. High yielding\nkinds, enhanced planting methods, promised irrigation water supply and\nmounting use of fertilizers have together led to beneficial and quick results.\nIt is the rain fed area that cuts down average yields per hectare.\n\nIn some of the states like [West Bengal](/wiki/West_Bengal \"West Bengal\"),\n[Assam](/wiki/Assam \"Assam\") and [Orissa](/wiki/Orissa,_India \"Orissa, India\")\ntwo crops of rice are raised in a year. Winter season in the north western\nIndia are extremely cold for rice. [Rice](/wiki/Rice \"Rice\") is considered as\nthe master crop of coastal India and in some regions of the eastern India\nwhere during the summer monsoon rainy season both high temperature and heavy\nrainfall provide ideal conditions for the cultivation of rice. Almost all\nparts of India are suitable for raising rice during the summer season provided\nthat the water is available. Thus, rice is also raised even in those parts of\nwestern [Uttar Pradesh](/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh \"Uttar Pradesh\"),\n[Punjab](/wiki/Punjab,_India \"Punjab, India\") and [Haryana](/wiki/Haryana\n\"Haryana\") where low level areas are waterlogged during the summer monsoon\nrainy season.\n\nWinter rice crop is a long duration crop and summer rice crop is a short\nduration crop. At some places in the eastern and southern parts of India, rice\ncrop of short duration is followed by the rice crop of long duration. Winter\nrice crop is raised preferably in low-lying areas that remain flooded mainly\nduring the rainy season. Autumn rice is raised in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra,\nRajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Summer, autumn and\nwinter rice crops are raised in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Assam and Orissa.\nSummer rice crop is raised on a small scale and on a small area. However,\nwinter rice crop is actually the leading rice crop accounting for a major\nportion of the total Hectare under rice in all seasons in the country.\nMoreover, in the last few years, several steps in order to augment yield per\nhectare were taken up very seriously at all levels. India ranks fourth in the\nproduction of wheat in the world. Favorable Geographical Condition for Wheat\nCultivation: In India, wheat is a winter crop. Wheat requires a moderate cool\nclimate with moderate rain. In India, it is grown in winter. It needs\ntemperature 10 degree C to 15 degree C for its cultivation. It thrives well in\nan average temperature of 16-degree C. Warm and sunny weather is essential at\nthe time of ripening. Wheat requires a rainfall of 50 cm to 100 cm during the\ngrowing season. Too much rain is injurious to the plant. On irrigated lands, a\nrainfall of 40 cm to 50 cm is sufficient. Light rainfall and cloudiness before\nthe grain ripens increase the productivity. Alluvial level plains are ideal\nfor wheat cultivation. Slightly rolling plains are also suitable. Plains\nshould be well drained so that water cannot stand there. Wheat requires\nfertile alluvial soil. Clay loamy soils or even black cotton soils are\nsuitable. Soil should retain moisture. A certain amount of lime in the soil is\nbeneficial. Labor factors are not as important in the wheat cultivation as in\nthe case of rice. However, labor is essential for the cultivation. The other\nrequirements of wheat cultivation include (i) irrigation, (ii) high yielding\nvarieties of seeds and (iii) the same way.\n\n## Rice Production by\nYear[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rice_production_in_India&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Rice Production by Year\")]\n\nSource: <http://drdpat.bih.nic.in/HS-B-Table-01.htm>.\n\nSL | Year | Area (Million Hectares) | Production (Million Tonnes) | Yield (Kg/Hectare)   \n---|---|---|---|---  \n1. | 1950-51 | 30.81 | 20.58 | 668   \n2. | 1951-52 | 29.83 | 21.30 | 714   \n3. | 1952-53 | 29.97 | 22.90 | 764   \n4. | 1953-54 | 31.29 | 28.21 | 902   \n5. | 1954-55 | 30.77 | 25.22 | 820   \n6. | 1955-56 | 31.52 | 27.56 | 874   \n7. | 1956-57 | 32.28 | 29.04 | 900   \n8. | 1957-58 | 32.30 | 25.53 | 790   \n9. | 1958-59 | 33.17 | 30.85 | 930   \n10. | 1959-60 | 33.82 | 31.68 | 937   \n11. | 1960-61 | 34.13 | 34.58 | 1,013   \n12. | 1961-62 | 34.69 | 35.66 | 1,028   \n13. | 1962-63 | 35.69 | 33.21 | 931   \n14. | 1963-64 | 35.81 | 37.00 | 1,033   \n15. | 1964-65 | 36.46 | 39.31 | 1,078   \n16. | 1965-66 | 35.47 | 30.59 | 862   \n17. | 1966-67 | 35.25 | 30.44 | 863   \n18. | 1967-68 | 36.44 | 37.61 | 1,032   \n19. | 1968-69 | 36.97 | 39.76 | 1,076   \n20. | 1969-70 | 37.68 | 40.43 | 1,073   \n21. | 1970-71 | 37.59 | 42.22 | 1,123   \n22. | 1971-72 | 37.76 | 43.07 | 1,141   \n23. | 1972-73 | 36.69 | 39.24 | 1,070   \n24. | 1973-74 | 38.29 | 44.05 | 1,151   \n25. | 1974-75 | 37.89 | 39.58 | 1,045   \n26. | 1975-76 | 39.48 | 48.74 | 1,235   \n27. | 1976-77 | 38.51 | 41.92 | 1,088   \n28. | 1977-78 | 40.28 | 52.67 | 1,308   \n29. | 1978-79 | 40.48 | 53.77 | 1,328   \n30. | 1979-80 | 39.42 | 42.33 | 1,074   \n31. | 1980-81 | 40.15 | 53.63 | 1,336   \n32. | 1981-82 | 40.71 | 53.25 | 1,308   \n33. | 1982-83 | 38.26 | 47.12 | 1,231   \n34. | 1983-84 | 41.24 | 60.10 | 1,457   \n35. | 1984-85 | 41.16 | 58.34 | 1,417   \n36. | 1985-86 | 41.14 | 63.83 | 1,552   \n37. | 1986-87 | 41.17 | 60.56 | 1,471   \n38. | 1987-88 | 38.81 | 56.86 | 1,465   \n39. | 1988-89 | 41.73 | 70.49 | 1,689   \n40. | 1989-90 | 42.17 | 73.57 | 1,745   \n41. | 1990-91 | 42.69 | 74.29 | 1,740   \n42. | 1991-92 | 42.65 | 74.68 | 1,751   \n43. | 1992-93 | 41.78 | 72.86 | 1,744   \n44. | 1993-94 | 42.54 | 80.30 | 1,888   \n45. | 1994-95 | 42.81 | 81.81 | 1,911   \n46. | 1995-96 | 42.84 | 76.98 | 1,797   \n47. | 1996-97 | 43.43 | 81.74 | 1,882   \n48. | 1997-98 | 43.45 | 82.53 | 1,900   \n49. | 1998-99 | 44.80 | 86.03 | 1,920   \n50. | 1999-00 | 44.97 | 89.48 | 1,990   \n  \n## Rice Production by\nState[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rice_production_in_India&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Rice Production by State\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Rice_Production_by_States_India.png/220px-\nRice_Production_by_States_India.png)](/wiki/File:Rice_Production_by_States_India.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rice_Production_by_States_India.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nRice Production by States India\n\nRice Production by States (Million Tonnes)[2] States | Rank  \n(2014-15) | Actual Production  \n(2014-15) | _% of Country Total  \n(2014-15)_ | _Cumulative % of Country Total  \n(2014-15)_ | Average Production  \n(2010-11 to 2014-15) | Estimate   \n(2015-16)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**India** | -
