The chip, about the\nsize of a large grain of rice, uses passive [RFID](/wiki/RFID \"RFID\") (Radio\nFrequency Identification) technology, and is also known as a PIT (Passive\nIntegrated Transponder) tag.\n\nExternally attached microchips such as RFID [ear tags](/wiki/Ear_tag \"Ear\ntag\") are commonly used to identify farm and ranch animals, with the exception\nof horses. Some external microchips can be read with the same scanner used\nwith implanted chips.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Uses and benefits\n  * 2 Usage\n  * 3 Components of a microchip\n  * 4 Implant location\n  * 5 Animal species\n  * 6 Worldwide use\n  * 7 Cross-compatibility and standards issues\n  * 8 Reported adverse reactions\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 Notes\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n## Uses and\nbenefits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Uses and benefits\")]\n\n[Animal shelters](/wiki/Animal_shelter \"Animal shelter\"), animal control\nofficers and veterinarians routinely look for microchips to return lost pets\nquickly to their owners, avoiding expenses for housing, food, medical care,\noutplacing and euthanasia. Many shelters place chips in all outplaced animals.\n\nMicrochips are also used by [kennels](/wiki/Kennel \"Kennel\"), breeders,\nbrokers, trainers, registries, [rescue groups](/wiki/Rescue_group \"Rescue\ngroup\"), [humane societies](/wiki/Humane_society \"Humane society\"),\n[clinics](/wiki/Clinic \"Clinic\"), [farms](/wiki/Farm \"Farm\"),\n[stables](/wiki/Stable \"Stable\"), animal clubs and associations, researchers,\nand [pet stores](/wiki/Pet_store \"Pet store\").\n\nSome [pet doors](/wiki/Pet_door \"Pet door\") can be programmed to be activated\nby the microchips of specific animals, allowing only certain animals to use\nthe door.[1]\n\nSome countries require microchips in imported animals to match\n[vaccination](/wiki/Vaccination \"Vaccination\") records. Microchip tagging may\nalso be required for [CITES](/wiki/CITES \"CITES\")-regulated international\ntrade in certain endangered animals: for example, [Asian\nArowana](/wiki/Asian_Arowana \"Asian Arowana\") are tagged to limit import to\ncaptive-bred fish. Also, birds not banded who cross international borders as\npets or for trade must be microchipped so that each bird is uniquely\nidentifiable.\n\n##\nUsage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Usage\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Cat_with_microchip_implant.JPG/220px-\nCat_with_microchip_implant.JPG)](/wiki/File:Cat_with_microchip_implant.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cat_with_microchip_implant.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nInformation about the implant is often imprinted on a collar tag worn by a pet\n\nMicrochips can be implanted by a veterinarian or at a shelter. After checking\nthat the animal does not already have a chip, the vet or technician injects\nthe chip with a syringe and records the chip's unique ID. No anesthetic is\nrequired it is a simple procedure and causes little discomfort: the pain is\nminimal and short-lived[2]. A test scan ensures correct operation.\n\nAn enrollment form is completed with chip ID, owner contact information, pet\nname and description, shelter and/or veterinarian contact information, and an\nalternate emergency contact designated by the pet owner. Some shelters and\nvets designate themselves as the primary contact to remain informed about\npossible problems with the animals they place. The form is sent to a registry,\nwho may be the chip manufacturer, distributor or an independent entity such as\na [pet recovery service](/wiki/Pet_recovery_service \"Pet recovery service\").\nSome countries have a single official national database. For a fee, the\nregistry typically provides 24-hour, toll-free telephone service for the life\nof the pet. Some veterinarians leave registration to the owner, usually done\nonline, but a chip without current contact information is essentially useless.\n\nThe owner receives a registration certificate with the chip ID and recovery\nservice contact information. The information can also be imprinted on a collar\ntag worn by the animal. Like an automobile [title](/wiki/Title_\\(property\\)\n\"Title \\(property\\)\"), the certificate serves as proof of ownership and is\ntransferred with the animal when it is sold or traded; an animal without a\ncertificate could be stolen.\n\nAuthorities and shelters examine strays for chips, providing the recovery\nservice with the ID number, description and location so they may notify the\nowner or contact. If the pet is wearing the collar tag, the finder does not\nneed a chip reader to contact the registry. An owner can also report a missing\npet to the recovery service, as vets look for chips in new animals and check\nwith the recovery service to see if it has been reported lost or stolen.\n\nMany veterinarians scan an animal's chip on every visit to verify correct\noperation. Some use the chip ID as their database index and print it on\nreceipts, test results, vaccination certifications and other records.\n\nSome veterinary tests and procedures require positive identification of the\nanimal, and a microchip may be acceptable for this purpose as an alternative\nto a tattoo.\n\n## Components of a\nmicrochip[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Components of a microchip\")]\n\nA microchip implant is a passive [RFID](/wiki/RFID \"RFID\") device. Lacking an\ninternal power source, it remains inert until it is powered by the scanner or\nother power source.\n\nMost implants contain three elements: a 'chip' or [integrated\ncircuit](/wiki/Integrated_circuit \"Integrated circuit\"); a coil\n[inductor](/wiki/Inductor \"Inductor\"), possibly with a\n[ferrite](/wiki/Ferrite_\\(magnet\\) \"Ferrite \\(magnet\\)\") core; and a\n[capacitor](/wiki/Capacitor \"Capacitor\"). The chip contains unique\nidentification data and electronic circuits to encode that information. The\ncoil acts as the secondary winding of a [transformer](/wiki/Transformer\n\"Transformer\"), receiving power inductively coupled to it from the scanner.\nThe coil and capacitor together form a resonant [LC circuit](/wiki/LC_circuit\n\"LC circuit\") tuned to the frequency of the scanner's oscillating magnetic\nfield to produce power for the chip. The chip then transmits its data back\nthrough the coil to the scanner.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Rfid-\nscanner.jpg/220px-Rfid-scanner.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rfid-scanner.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rfid-scanner.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nExample of an RFID scanner used with animal microchip implants.\n\nThese components are encased in [biocompatible](/wiki/Biocompatibility\n\"Biocompatibility\") soda lime or borosilicate glass and hermetically sealed.\nDatamars has also started selling polymer microchips that are being implanted\nin pets.[3].\n\n## Implant\nlocation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Implant location\")]\n\nIn [dogs](/wiki/Dog \"Dog\") and [cats](/wiki/Cat \"Cat\"), chips are usually\ninserted below the skin at the back of the neck between the shoulder blades on\nthe dorsal midline. According to one reference, continental European pets get\nthe implant in the left side of the neck.[4] The chip can often be felt under\nthe skin. Thin layers of [connective tissue](/wiki/Connective_tissue\n\"Connective tissue\") form around the implant and hold it in place.\n\n[Horses](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\") are microchipped on the left side of the neck,\nhalfway between the poll and withers and approximately one inch below the\nmidline of the mane, into the [nuchal ligament](/wiki/Nuchal_ligament \"Nuchal\nligament\").\n\n[Birds](/wiki/Bird \"Bird\") are implanted in their breast muscles. Proper\nrestraint is necessary so the operation requires either two people (an avian\n[veterinarian](/wiki/Veterinarian \"Veterinarian\") and a veterinary\n[technician](/wiki/Technician \"Technician\")) or general\n[anesthesia](/wiki/Anesthesia \"Anesthesia\").\n\nImplanted microchips can distort [magnetic resonance\nimaging](/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging \"Magnetic resonance imaging\")\n(MRIs), including those of the spinal cord.[5]\n\n## Animal\nspecies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Animal species\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Horse_microchiping_3.jpg/250px-\nHorse_microchiping_3.jpg)](/wiki/File:Horse_microchiping_3.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Horse_microchiping_3.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nHorse microchipping\n\nMany animal species have been microchipped, including\n[cockatiels](/wiki/Cockatiel \"Cockatiel\") and other parrots, horses,\n[llamas](/wiki/Llama \"Llama\"), [alpacas](/wiki/Alpaca \"Alpaca\"),\n[goats](/wiki/Goat \"Goat\"), [sheep](/wiki/Sheep \"Sheep\"), miniature\n[pigs](/wiki/Pig \"Pig\"), [rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit \"Rabbit\"), [deer](/wiki/Deer\n\"Deer\"), [ferrets](/wiki/Ferret \"Ferret\"), [penguins](/wiki/Penguins\n\"Penguins\"), sharks, [snakes](/wiki/Snake \"Snake\"), [lizards](/wiki/Lizard\n\"Lizard\"), [alligators](/wiki/Alligator \"Alligator\"), [turtles](/wiki/Turtle\n\"Turtle\"), [toads](/wiki/Toad \"Toad\"), [frogs](/wiki/Frog \"Frog\"), rare\n[fish](/wiki/Fish \"Fish\"), [chimpanzees](/wiki/Chimpanzees \"Chimpanzees\"),\n[mice](/wiki/Mouse \"Mouse\"), and [prairie dogs](/wiki/Prairie_dog \"Prairie\ndog\")—even [whales](/wiki/Whale \"Whale\") and [elephants](/wiki/Elephant\n\"Elephant\"). The [U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nService](/wiki/U.S._Fish_and_Wildlife_Service \"U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nService\") uses microchipping in its research of wild [bison](/wiki/Bison\n\"Bison\"), black-footed ferrets, [grizzly bears](/wiki/Grizzly_bear \"Grizzly\nbear\"), [elk](/wiki/Red_Deer \"Red Deer\"), [white-tailed deer](/wiki/White-\ntailed_deer \"White-tailed deer\"), giant land [tortoises](/wiki/Tortoise\n\"Tortoise\") and [armadillos](/wiki/Armadillo \"Armadillo\").\n\n## Worldwide\nuse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Worldwide use\")]\n\nMicrochips are not yet universal, but they are legally required in some\njurisdictions such as the state of [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales\n\"New South Wales\"), [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\")[6] and the United\nKingdom (for dogs, since 6 April 2016[7]).\n\nSome countries, such as [Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\"), require ISO-compliant\nmicrochips or a compatible reader on imported dogs and cats.[8]\n\nIn [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\"), all dogs first registered\nafter 1 July 2006 must be microchipped. Farmers protested that [farm\ndogs](/wiki/Herding_dog \"Herding dog\") should be exempt, drawing a parallel to\nthe [Dog Tax War](/wiki/Dog_Tax_War \"Dog Tax War\") of 1898.[9] Farm dogs were\nexempted from microchipping in an amendment to the legislation passed in June\n2006.[10] A [National Animal Identification and\nTracing](/wiki/National_Animal_Identification_and_Tracing \"National Animal\nIdentification and Tracing\") scheme in New Zealand is currently being\ndeveloped for tracking livestock.\n\nIn April 2012 [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\")\nbecame the first part of the United Kingdom to require microchipping of\nindividually licensed dogs.[11] Dog microchipping became mandatory in England\non 6 April 2016.[12]\n\nIn Israel, microchips in dogs are mandatory.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAustralia has a [National Livestock Identification\nSystem](/wiki/National_Livestock_Identification_System \"National Livestock\nIdentification System\").\n\nThe United States uses the [National Animal Identification\nSystem](/wiki/National_Animal_Identification_System \"National Animal\nIdentification System\") for farm and ranch animals other than dogs and cats.\nIn most species except horses, an external eartag is typically used in lieu of\nan implant microchip. Eartags with microchips or simply stamped with a visible\nnumber can be used. Both use ISO 15 digit microchip numbers with the U.S.\ncountry code of 840.\n\n## Cross-compatibility and standards\nissues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Cross-compatibility and standards issues\")]\n\nIn most countries, pet ID chips adhere to an international standard to promote\ncompatibility between chips and scanners. In the United States, however, three\nproprietary types of chips compete along with the international standard.\nScanners distributed to United States shelters and veterinarians well into\n2006 could each read at most three of the four types. Scanners with quad-read\ncapability are now available and are increasingly considered required\nequipment. Older scanner models will be in use for some time, so United States\npet owners must still choose between a chip with good coverage by existing\nscanners and one compatible with the international standard. The four types\ninclude:\n\n  * The **ISO Conformant Full[Duplex](/wiki/Duplex_\\(telecommunications\\) \"Duplex \\(telecommunications\\)\")** type has the greatest international acceptance. It is common in many countries including Europe (since the late 1990s) and Canada. It is one of two chip protocol types (along with the \"Half Duplex\" type sometimes used in farm and ranch animals) that conform to [International Organization for Standardization](/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization \"International Organization for Standardization\") standards [ISO 11784 & 11785](/wiki/ISO_11784_%26_11785 \"ISO 11784 & 11785\"). To support international/multivendor application, the 3-digit country code can contain an assigned [ISO country code](/wiki/ISO_3166-1_numeric \"ISO 3166-1 numeric\") or a manufacturer code from 900 to 998 plus its identifying serial number.[Note 1] In the United States, distribution of this type has been controversial. When 24PetWatch.com began distributing them in 2003 (and more famously [Banfield Pet Hospitals](/wiki/Banfield_\\(pet_hospitals\\) \"Banfield \\(pet hospitals\\)\") in 2004) many shelter scanners couldn't read them. (Some still can't; asking local shelters about this is still a good idea.) At least one Banfield-chipped pet was inadvertently euthanized.[13]\n  * The **Trovan Unique** type is another pet chip protocol type in use since 1990 in pets in the United States.[14] Patent problems forced the withdrawal of Trovan's implanter device from United States distribution and they became uncommon in pets in the United States, although Trovan's original registry database \"infopet.biz\" remained in operation. In early 2007, the [American Kennel Club](/wiki/American_Kennel_Club \"American Kennel Club\")'s chip registration service, AKC Companion Animal Recovery Corp, which had been the authorized registry for HomeAgain brand chips made by Destron/Digital Angel, began distributing Trovan chips with a different implanter. These chips are read by the Trovan, HomeAgain (Destron Fearing), and Bayer (Black Label) readers. Despite multiple offers from Trovan to AVID [15] to license the technology to read the Trovan chips, AVID continues to distribute readers that do not read Trovan or the ISO compliant chips.\n  * A third type sometimes known as **FECAVA** or **Destron**[Note 2] is available under various brand names. These include, in the United States, \"Avid Eurochip\", the common current 24PetWatch chips, and the original (and still popular) style of HomeAgain chips. ([HomeAgain](http://public.homeagain.com) and [24Petwatch](http://www.24petwatch.com) can now supply the true ISO chip instead on request.) Chips of this type have 10 digit [hexadecimal] chip numbers. This \"FECAVA\" type is readable on a wide variety of scanners in the United States and has been less controversial, although its level of adherence to the ISO standards is sometimes exaggerated in some descriptions.[16][17][18] The ISO standard has an annex (appendix) recommending that three older chip types be supported by scanners, including a 35-bit \"FECAVA\"/\"Destron\" type.[19] The common Eurochip/HomeAgain chips don't agree perfectly with the annex description, although the differences are sometimes considered minor.[Note 3] But the ISO standard also makes it clear[Note 4] that only its 64-bit \"full-duplex\" and \"half-duplex\" types are \"conformant\"; even chips (e.g., the Trovan Unique) that match one of the Annex descriptions are not. More visibly, FECAVA cannot support the ISO standard's required country/manufacturer codes. They may be accepted by authorities in many countries where ISO-standard chips are the norm, but not by those requiring literal ISO conformance.\n  * Finally, there's the **AVID brand Friendchip** type, which is peculiar due to its encryption characteristics. Cryptographic features are not necessarily unwelcome; few pet rescuers or humane societies would object to a design that outputs an ID number \"in the clear\" for anyone to read, along with authentication features for detection of counterfeit chips, but the authentication in \"Friendchips\" has been found lacking and rather easy to spoof to the AVID scanner. Although no authentication encryption is involved, obfuscation requires proprietary information to convert transmitted chip data to its original label ID code. Well into 2006, scanners containing the proprietary decryption were provided to the United States market only by AVID and Destron/Digital Angel; Destron/Digital Angel put the decryption feature in some, but not all, of its scanners, possibly as early as 1996. (For years, its scanners distributed to shelters through HomeAgain usually had full decryption, while many sold to veterinarians would only state that an AVID chip had been found.) Well into 2006, both were resisting calls from consumers and welfare group officials to bring scanners to the United States shelter community combining AVID decryption capability with the ability to read ISO-compliant chips. Some complained[20] that AVID itself had long marketed combination pet scanners compatible with all common pet chips except possibly Trovan outside the United States. By keeping them out of the United States, it could be considered partly culpable in the missed-ISO chips problem others blamed on Banfield.[Note 5] In 2006, the European manufacturer Datamars, a supplier of ISO chips used by Banfield and others, gained access to the decryption secrets and began supplying scanners with them to United States customers. This \"Black Label\" scanner was the first four-standard full-multi pet scanner in the United States market. Later in 2006, Digital Angel announced[21] that it would supply a full-multi scanner in the United States.[Note 6] In 2008 AVID announced a \"breakthrough\" scanner,[22] although as of October 2010[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit) AVID's is still so uncommon that it's unclear whether it supports the Trovan chip. Trovan also acquired the decryption technology in 2006 or earlier, and now provides it in scanners distributed in the United States by AKC-CAR. (Some are quad-read, but others lack full ISO support.)\n\nNumerous references in print state that the incompatibilities between\ndifferent chip types are a matter of \"frequency\". One may find claims that\nearly ISO adopters in the United States endangered their customers' pets by\ngiving them ISO chips that work at a \"different frequency\" from the local\nshelter's scanner, or that the United States government considered forcing an\nincompatible frequency change. These claims were little challenged by\nmanufacturers and distributors of ISO chips, although later evidence suggests\nthe claims were disinformation. In fact, all chips operate at the scanner's\nfrequency. Although ISO chips are optimized for 134.2 [kHz](/wiki/KHz \"KHz\"),\nin practice they are readable at 125 kHz and the \"125 kHz\" chips are readable\nat 134.2 kHz. Confirmation comes from government filings that indicate the\nsupposed \"multi-frequency\" scanners now commonly available are really single-\nfrequency scanners operating at 125, 134.2 or 128 kHz. In particular, the\nUnited States HomeAgain scanner didn't change excitation frequency when ISO-\nread capability was added; it's still a single frequency, 125 kHz scanner.[23]\n\n| Expected results for chip type  \n(OK=Good read  \nNR=No read  \nDO=Detect Only with no number given)  \n---|---  \nScanner to test  | ISO Conformant Full Duplex chip  | AVID Encrypted \"FriendChip\" | Original U.S. HomeAgain, AVID Eurochip,[Note 7] or FECAVA  | \"Trovan Unique\" and current AKC CAR chips   \nMinimal ISO Conformant Scanner (also must read HALF Duplex chips common in livestock ear tags)  | OK | NR | NR | NR   \nAVID Basic U.S. Scanner[24] | NR | OK | NR | NR   \nAVID Deluxe U.S. Scanner  | NR | OK | OK | NR   \nAVID Universal Scanner sold outside U.S.[25] | OK | OK | OK | NR Assumed   \nAVID MiniTracker Pro Scanner announced August 2008[26] | OK | OK | OK | NR according to some (Few have seen one.)   \nVarious vintages of U.S. HomeAgain \"Universal\" Shelter Scanners by Destron/Digital Angel Corp.  | NR,DO, or OK | OK | OK | Possibly all OK   \nTypical Destron/Digital Angel Corp.

A recent\nstudy found no safety concerns for microchipped animals with RFID chips\nundergoing [MRI](/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging \"Magnetic resonance\nimaging\") at one [Tesla](/wiki/Tesla_\\(unit\\) \"Tesla \\(unit\\)\") magnetic field\nstrength.[40] In 2011 a microchip-associated [fibrosarcoma](/wiki/Fibrosarcoma\n\"Fibrosarcoma\") was reported found in the neck of a 9-year old, neutered-male\ncat. Histological examination was consistent with postinjection\n[sarcoma](/wiki/Sarcoma \"Sarcoma\"), but all prior vaccinations occurred in the\nhindlegs.[41]\n\nThe microchip is implanted in the subcutaneous tissues causing an inflammatory\nresponse until scar tissue develops around the microchip. Studies on horses\n[42] are used as the basis for short inflammatory response claims, while\nprocedures on done on small kittens and puppies. Humans are reporting swelling\nand bruising at the time of implant with itching and pinching sensations for\nup to two years.[43] The broader impacts on inflammatory disorders and cancer\nhave not been determined and most of the health risks that were defined in the\nFDA Guidance developed for human implants [44] should be considered. Adverse\nevent reporting in the US can be made by the pet owner or a veterinarian to\nthe FDA.\n<https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ReportaProblem/ucm055305.htm>\n\nAdverse event reporting for animal microchips has been inconsistent. The UK’s\nVeterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) assumed the task of adverse event\nreporting for animal microchips there in April 2014. Mandatory microchipping\nof dogs and mandatory adverse event reporting went into effect in the UK in\nFebruary of 2015. The first report was issued for the period of April 2014\nthrough December 2015 [45]. There were 1,500 adverse events reported for an\nunknown number of pets. The estimate for the total cat and dog population of\nthe UK is 16 million with 8.5 million dogs subject to mandatory microchipping.\n4.5% of the adverse events are from adverse reactions and most of the rest\nfrom scanner failures and migration. Microchip Adverse Event Reports for 2016\nand 2017 do not appear to have been released.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Microchip implant (human)](/wiki/Microchip_implant_\\(human\\) \"Microchip implant \\(human\\)\")\n  * [PositiveID](/wiki/PositiveID \"PositiveID\")\n  * [Proximity card](/wiki/Proximity_card \"Proximity card\")\n  * [Pet recovery service](/wiki/Pet_recovery_service \"Pet recovery service\")\n  * [Remote-controlled animal](/wiki/Remote-controlled_animal \"Remote-controlled animal\")\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** For display, typically the three country/manufacturer code digits are followed by twelve digits of serial number to make a 15-digit numeric string.\n  2. **Jump up ^** Curiously, an actual matching descriptive specification from the Federation of European Companion Animal Veterinary Associations, or one from Destron Corporation, remains illusive.\n  3. **Jump up ^** The differences are obvious and easily surmounted by someone trying to make a scanner for a FECAVA chip specimen, so the Annex is still quite useful. (The actual FECAVA [frequency-modulated](/wiki/Frequency-modulated \"Frequency-modulated\") signals are inverted (backwards) from the Annex specification.)\n  4. **Jump up ^** This is found in clauses 2 and 6 of ISO 11785; the two actual conformant 64-bit types are described in clauses 6.1 and 6.2.\n  5. **Jump up ^** Few of the petitioners bothered to ask AVID to add Trovan-chip compatibility at that time, as these chips would remain uncommon and obscure until 2007 in the U.S.\n  6. **Jump up ^** In addition to its current scanners with full support for ISO full duplex chips, and maybe ten years production of earlier scanners with no ISO support, Destron/Digital Angel Corp. is also reported to have made in-between models circa 2006, one that gives a detection indication, but no number for ISO chips, and one model that gives either simple detection or full number readout, depending perhaps on the chip's manufacturer or some other factor. These models may be hard to discern without many specimen chips; upgrades may be available, especially to current customer partners of HomeAgain.\n  7. **Jump up ^** A mention of a chip type called \"AVID Travelchip\" has been removed from this heading. It appears that \"Travelchip\" was actually a trademark not of AVID itself but of a chip distributor, which used it as a blanket term for several different chip types sold in value-added kits- firstly AVID Eurochips, later HomeAgain types both regular and ISO.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Microchip_implant_\\(animal\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Lomas, Natasha (28 June 2017).
