It was recorded by Redding twice in 1967, including once just days\nbefore his death in a plane crash. The song was released on [Stax\nRecords](/wiki/Stax_Records \"Stax Records\")' Volt label in 1968,[2] becoming\nthe first posthumous single to top the charts in the US.[3] It reached number\n3 on the [UK Singles Chart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\").\n\nRedding started writing the lyrics to the song in August 1967, while sitting\non a rented houseboat in [Sausalito, California](/wiki/Sausalito,_California\n\"Sausalito, California\"). He completed the song with the help of Cropper, who\nwas a Stax producer and the guitarist for [Booker T. & the\nM.G.'s](/wiki/Booker_T._%26_the_M.G.%27s \"Booker T. & the M.G.'s\").

While touring in support of the\nalbums _[King& Queen](/wiki/King_%26_Queen \"King & Queen\")_ (a collaboration\nwith female vocalist [Carla Thomas](/wiki/Carla_Thomas \"Carla Thomas\")) and\n_[Live in Europe](/wiki/Live_in_Europe_\\(Otis_Redding_album\\) \"Live in Europe\n\\(Otis Redding album\\)\")_ , he continued to scribble lines of the song on\nnapkins and hotel paper. In November of that year, he joined producer and\nguitarist [Steve Cropper](/wiki/Steve_Cropper \"Steve Cropper\") at the Stax\nrecording studio in [Memphis, Tennessee](/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee \"Memphis,\nTennessee\"), to record the song.[4]\n\nIn a September 1990 interview on [NPR](/wiki/NPR \"NPR\")'s _[Fresh\nAir](/wiki/Fresh_Air \"Fresh Air\")_ , Cropper explained the origins of the\nsong:\n\n> Otis was one of those the kind of guy who had 100 ideas. [...] He had been\n> in San Francisco doing [The Fillmore](/wiki/The_Fillmore \"The Fillmore\").\n> And the story that I got he was renting boathouse or stayed at a boathouse\n> or something and that's where he got the idea of the ships coming in the bay\n> there. And that's about all he had: \"I watch the ships come in and I watch\n> them roll away again.\" I just took that... and I finished the lyrics. If you\n> listen to the songs I collaborated with Otis, most of the lyrics are about\n> him. [...] Otis didn't really write about himself but I did. Songs like\n> \"[Mr. Pitiful](/wiki/Mr._Pitiful \"Mr. Pitiful\"),\" \"Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad\n> Song)\"; they were about Otis and Otis' life. \"Dock of the Bay\" was exactly\n> that: \"I left my home in Georgia, headed for the Frisco Bay\" was all about\n> him going out to San Francisco to perform.[5]\n\nTogether, they completed the music and melancholy lyrics of \"(Sittin' On) The\nDock of the Bay.\" From those sessions emerged Redding's final recorded work,\nincluding \"Dock of the Bay,\" which was recorded on November 22, with\nadditional [overdubs](/wiki/Overdub \"Overdub\") on December 7.[1] Redding's\nrestrained yet emotive delivery is backed by Cropper's memorably succinct\nguitar playing.[6] The song is somewhat different in style from most of\nRedding's other recordings.[1] While discussing the song with his wife,\nRedding stated that he had wanted to \"be a little different\" with \"The Dock of\nthe Bay\" and \"change his style\".[1] There were concerns that \"The Dock of the\nBay\" had too much of a pop feel for an Otis Redding record, and contracting\nthe Stax [gospel](/wiki/Gospel_music \"Gospel music\") act the [Staple\nSingers](/wiki/The_Staple_Singers \"The Staple Singers\") to record backing\nvocals was discussed but never carried out.[1] Redding had considered the song\nto be unfinished and planned to record what he considered a final version, but\nnever got the chance.[7] The song features a whistled tune heard before the\nsong's fade. It was originally performed by Redding, who (according to\nCropper) had \"this little fadeout rap he was gonna do, an ad-lib. He forgot\nwhat it was so he started whistling.\"[8] Redding continued to tour after the\nrecording sessions. On December 10, his charter plane crashed into [Lake\nMonona](/wiki/Lake_Monona \"Lake Monona\"), outside [Madison,\nWisconsin](/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin \"Madison, Wisconsin\"). Redding and six\nothers were killed.[9]\n\nAfter Redding's death, Cropper mixed \"Dock of the Bay\" at Stax Studios. He\nadded the sound of [seagulls](/wiki/Seagulls \"Seagulls\") and waves crashing to\nthe background, as Redding had requested, recalling the sounds he heard when\nhe was staying on the houseboat.[10] The fade-out whistling was originally\nrecorded by Redding and was re-recorded by his bandleader, [Sam \"Bluzman\"\nTaylor](/wiki/Sam_Taylor_\\(blues_musician\\) \"Sam Taylor \\(blues\nmusician\\)\").[11][12]\n\n###\nCharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=\\(Sittin%27_On\\)_The_Dock_of_the_Bay&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Charts\")]\n\n#### Weekly\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=\\(Sittin%27_On\\)_The_Dock_of_the_Bay&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Weekly charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1968) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nCanada [RPM Top Singles](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\") | 7  \nNew Zealand (_[Listener](/wiki/New_Zealand_Listener \"New Zealand Listener\")_)[13] | 3  \n[UK Singles Chart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\")[14] | 3  \nU.S. [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[15] | 1  \nU.S. [Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles](/wiki/Hot_R%26B/Hip-Hop_Songs \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs\")[15] | 1  \n  \n#### Year-end\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=\\(Sittin%27_On\\)_The_Dock_of_the_Bay&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Year-end charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1968) | Rank  \n---|---  \nCanada[16] | 44  \nUK[17] | 38  \nU.S. _Billboard_ Hot 100[18] | 4  \n  \n## Later\nversions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=\\(Sittin%27_On\\)_The_Dock_of_the_Bay&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Later versions\")]\n\n\"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay\"  \n---  \n[![Sammy Hagar - \\(Sittin' on\\) The Dock of the Bay single front\ncover.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9b/Sammy_Hagar_-_%28Sittin%27_on%29_The_Dock_of_the_Bay_single_front_cover.jpg/220px-\nSammy_Hagar_-_%28Sittin%27_on%29_The_Dock_of_the_Bay_single_front_cover.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sammy_Hagar_-_\\(Sittin%27_on\\)_The_Dock_of_the_Bay_single_front_cover.jpg)\n7\" single cover  \n[Single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\") by [Sammy\nHagar](/wiki/Sammy_Hagar \"Sammy Hagar\")  \n[B-side](/wiki/A-side_and_B-side \"A-side and B-side\") | \"[I've Done Everything for You](/wiki/I%27ve_Done_Everything_for_You \"I've Done Everything for You\")\"  \nReleased | 1979  \nFormat | [7\" single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\")  \nRecorded | May 1979  \n[Genre](/wiki/Music_genre \"Music genre\") | [Rock](/wiki/Rock_music \"Rock music\")  \nLength | 3:03  \n[Label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\") | [Capitol](/wiki/Capitol_Records \"Capitol Records\")  \n[Songwriter(s)](/wiki/Songwriter \"Songwriter\") | \n\n  * Steve Cropper\n  * Otis Redding\n\n  \n[Producer(s)](/wiki/Record_producer \"Record producer\") | [Carter](/wiki/Carter_\\(music\\) \"Carter \\(music\\)\")  \n\"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay\"  \n---  \n[![Michael Bolton - \\(Sittin' On\\) The Dock of the\nBay.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/52/Michael_Bolton_-_%28Sittin%27_On%29_The_Dock_of_the_Bay.jpg/220px-\nMichael_Bolton_-_%28Sittin%27_On%29_The_Dock_of_the_Bay.jpg)](/wiki/File:Michael_Bolton_-_\\(Sittin%27_On\\)_The_Dock_of_the_Bay.jpg)\n7\" single cover  \n[Single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\") by [Michael\nBolton](/wiki/Michael_Bolton \"Michael Bolton\")  \n[B-side](/wiki/A-side_and_B-side \"A-side and B-side\") | \"Call My Name\"  \nReleased | 1987  \nFormat | [7\" single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\")  \n[Genre](/wiki/Music_genre \"Music genre\") | \n\n  * [Pop rock](/wiki/Pop_rock \"Pop rock\")\n  * [adult contemporary](/wiki/Adult_contemporary_music \"Adult contemporary music\")\n\n  \nLength | 3:50  \n[Label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\") | [Columbia](/wiki/Columbia_Records \"Columbia Records\")  \n[Songwriter(s)](/wiki/Songwriter \"Songwriter\") | \n\n  * Steve Cropper\n  * Otis Redding\n\n  \n[Producer(s)](/wiki/Record_producer \"Record producer\") | \n\n  * Jonathan Cain\n  * Keith Diamond\n  * Susan Hamilton\n\n  \n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) | This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.
