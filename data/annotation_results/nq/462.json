In some\nepisodes, his tough exterior crumbles when he encounters other people's needs\nand he eventually makes decisions that show an ethical regard for doing what\nis right.\n\nHis relationship with his children is complex. Although he dotes on his lying,\nmanipulative, promiscuous daughter, Laurie (with whom, tellingly, Kitty has a\nstrained and contentious relationship), he points out Eric's perceived flaws\nand faults mercilessly. The two clash in most episodes with Eric teasing his\nfather, or \"poking the bear\". Red frequently threatens to \"stick my foot up\nyour ass\" to Eric but is never seen physically disciplining his son, usually\npunishing him with chores, fines, and, once, by imposing a strict curfew,\nwhich leads to windows being nailed shut, bed checks, etc. until Kitty calls\nan end to it. Eric usually views these paternal idiosyncracies in a humorous\nlight, even lampooning them, but sometimes seems to be holding in his own\nanger and doing a slow burn.\n\nOn other occasions, father and son unite to collude in a scheme or plot, share\na joke, or even face the displeasure of Kitty together. Many episodes show the\nrespect between the two characters, with Red even admitting on one occasion\nthat his love for Eric does not need to be articulated, it is \"just a given\".\nDespite Red's firm stance with his son, he protects Eric when the situation\ncalls for it; for example, in one episode when Bob accuses Eric of being a\npoor influence on his daughter, Red gives him a cold send-off.\n\nRed finds his neighbors, Bob and Midge Pinciotti, perplexing and vexatious.\nBob is genial but insensitive, and Midge is rather dim-witted. Their daughter,\nDonna, is Eric's girlfriend. Red dislikes spending time in their company,\nalthough frequently compelled to do so by his wife, Kitty. In particular, his\nviews of Bob range from annoyance to contempt. Despite this antagonistic\nattitude, several episodes portray Red as a good neighbor who will come to the\nassistance of Bob when absolutely needed.\n\nRed shows very strict discipline to those with lesser authority than himself\n(especially the teenagers), from which he seems to take joy. In his youth, Red\nserved in the U.S. Navy (in the season 3 episode, [\"Jackie Bags\nHyde\"](/wiki/That_%2770s_Show_\\(season_3\\)#ep59 \"That '70s Show \\(season\n3\\)\"), he is shown wearing the dress-blue uniform of a [Chief Petty\nOfficer](/wiki/Chief_Petty_Officer \"Chief Petty Officer\") for [Veterans\nDay](/wiki/Veterans_Day_\\(United_States\\) \"Veterans Day \\(United States\\)\"))\nand often brings up memories of his service in [Korea](/wiki/Korean_War\n\"Korean War\").\n\nRed was a Boatswain Mate in the Navy during World War II and Korea. Since he\nserved on a destroyer but saw land combat in Guadalcanal (August 1942 –\nFebruary 1943) and Korea (1950–1953) it would appear that he served as a\n[Seabee](/wiki/Seabee \"Seabee\"), an assault boat pilot, or in [EOD (Explosive\nOrdnance Disposal)](/wiki/Bomb_disposal \"Bomb disposal\"). He might have also\nserved on board a submarine, as evidenced in Season 8, Episode 6 \"Long Away\".\nHe is wearing Submarine Warfare (Dolphins) on his garrison cap during the\nVeterans reunion. On one occasion, when Red and Kitty are making out in their\ncar, a policeman knocks on the window, not realizing it is a married couple\ninside. Red sharply dispatches him and Kitty says, \"How sweet, you let him off\nwith a warning\".\n\nIn one episode, he and Eric have both completely forgotten about Kitty's\nbirthday, which deeply upsets her. After purchasing her some very low quality\n\"gifts\" from the only open nearby establishment, a garage, items Kitty\nimmediately recognizes as junk, Red cheers her up by taking her square-\ndancing, an activity she enjoys.\n\nRed loves to drink beer and consume food which is bad for his health, having\nsuffered from a [heart attack](/wiki/Heart_attack \"Heart attack\") on one\noccasion. Red is also shown as a die-hard fan of the [Green Bay\nPackers](/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers \"Green Bay Packers\"), even, in one episode,\nthreatening to kick out visiting new neighbors, Josh and Jeff who are a gay\nmale couple, solely because they were [Minnesota\nVikings](/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings \"Minnesota Vikings\") fans. He is also a fan\nof the [Milwaukee Bucks](/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks \"Milwaukee Bucks\") and the\n[Milwaukee Brewers](/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers \"Milwaukee Brewers\").\n\n## Health problems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Forman&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Health problems\")]\n\nRed's health has been the subject of humor on occasion. In the third and sixth\nseasons, he is briefly put on a diet that requires him to cut out red\n[meat](/wiki/Meat \"Meat\") among other foods that he generally likes and, in\nstereotypical sitcom fashion, he is forced to eat \"healthy\" food that is good\nfor him but that he finds unappealing. On both occasions, he defies the diet\nby eating \"real food\" behind Kitty's back. When faced with mush, he comments\n\"This isn't food, this is what food eats!\" When faced with his diet in the\nsixth season, after his heart attack upon learning Laurie has married Fez (he\nhas a problem with foreigners, he throws the list of what he cannot have away,\nexplaining to Kitty that if he had known what he would be asked to give up, \"I\nwould have walked straight into that bright light and never looked back!\"\n\nAt one point, shortly after finding out that Eric and Donna were moving to\nMadison, Red went fishing to calm down, and comes back with the surprising\nnews that he is proud of Eric for his initiative in moving away and becoming\nengaged, and even more so for his standing up to Red by insisting on marrying\nDonna despite Red's disapproval. A surprised Kitty and an overjoyed Eric\nlisten while Red agrees to pay for both the wedding and Eric's college fund.\nHe also shakes Eric's hand, proudly telling his son that he is now a man and\nhe has his blessing. After his heart attack, which prompts Eric to stay home,\nRed's attitude towards Eric does a complete reversal, and Red goes back to\ncalling his son \"dumbass\", presumably due to his disappointment in Eric's\nfailure to live up to his expectations yet again, although he told Eric that\nhe was proud of him for deciding to stay and help the family instead of\nleaving for college. This reversal could be due to Eric leaving Donna at the\naltar and subsequently spending a year doing nothing, or the producers' use of\na [\"Reset Button\"](/wiki/Reset_button_technique \"Reset button technique\") to\nget the [status quo](/wiki/Status_quo \"Status quo\") back.\n\n## Political\nleanings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Forman&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Political leanings\")]\n\nFor the first few seasons of the series' run, Red is established as a [blue\ncollar](/wiki/Blue_collar \"Blue collar\")\n[conservative](/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States \"Conservatism in the\nUnited States\"). He made a joke at [Nixon's](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard\nNixon\") expense in the first season after Eric streaked through the crowd\nwhile wearing a Nixon mask and, in a pivotal moment, expressed disdain for\n[Gerald Ford](/wiki/Gerald_Ford \"Gerald Ford\") (when allowed to ask President\nFord a question he said \"Hey 'Gerry', here's my question: 'How the hell could\nyou [pardon Nixon](/wiki/Nixon_pardon#Pardon_of_Nixon \"Nixon pardon\")?'\") in\nfront of the entire town. However, without precedent, later seasons portrayed\nhim to be a staunch [Republican](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Republican Party \\(United States\\)\"), who became angry when Eric made an\nanti-Nixon joke in the fifth season, which Eric tries to cover by replying,\n\"Nixon was framed and Kennedy was a commie.\" It is likely that, like many\nRepublican voters in the 1970s, Red is disappointed in Nixon and Ford, but\nafterwards leans back to supporting the Republican Party. In addition, many\nNixon supporters felt that pardoning Nixon was akin to admitting he was\nguilty.\n\nRed feels strongly about the founding principles of the American government,\nowing to his service in the Navy as a [Boatswain's\nMate](/wiki/Boatswain%27s_Mate_\\(United_States_Navy\\) \"Boatswain's Mate\n\\(United States Navy\\)\"). He also tries to live up to what are generally\nconsidered American \"[family values](/wiki/Family_values \"Family values\")\":\nhard work, devotion to his family and being faithful to his wife. He is\ndisgusted by [swinger](/wiki/Swinging_\\(sexual_practice\\) \"Swinging \\(sexual\npractice\\)\") sex clubs (which he considers immoral) and political corruption\n(on hearing that Jackie's wealthy father may be able to bribe his way out of\njail, an appalled Red mutters, \"I'm so glad I took a piece of\n[shrapnel](/wiki/Shrapnel_shell \"Shrapnel shell\") to make that possible\").\n\nRed also dislikes foreigners, which is the main reason he doesn't see eye-to-\neye with Fez. One episode, \"Hunting\" saw him taking offense at Fez's remark\nof, \"Not everything in the Constitution makes sense.\" He dislikes anyone and\nanything not from America – despite driving a Toyota. In fact out of everyone\nin his family he was the most comfortable and casual when Hyde's biological\nfather William Barnett (an African-American) came to his house. He once\ndescribed [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") and [France](/wiki/France \"France\")\nas \"lesser countries\", and was upset to find that his daughter Laurie's room\nhad posters of foreign cars on her bedroom walls after Hyde moved into it, and\ngenerally refers to the rest of the world as \"not America\". Along with Canada\nand France, Red also dislikes [Germany](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\"),\n[Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\") and [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great\nBritain\"), though not explicitly stated, [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\") (for\ntheir role in World War II) and, especially, North Korea as he fought there.\nHe also seems bitter about America not winning the [Vietnam\nWar](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\"), claiming, \"We didn't lose the war, it\nwas a tie\". In one episode, while [Hyde](/wiki/Steven_Hyde \"Steven Hyde\") was\nstating a conspiracy theory about the government putting tracking devices in\ntheir brains, Red patriotically replied, \"Without our government, you’d be\nstuck in [Siberia](/wiki/Siberia \"Siberia\") now, sucking the juice from a\nrotten commie potato. Let me tell you something. If the U.S. government\ndecides to stick a tracking device up your ass, you say, 'Thank You! and God\nBless America! '\" Insulting communists is a favorite pastime with Red such as\nwhen he calls Eric \"the laziest non-communist I ever met\". However, when he\nsells his muffler shop so he can retire he says he does not care if the store\nis converted to a \"communist recreation center\".\n\n## Relationship with the\nteenagers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Forman&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Relationship with the teenagers\")]\n\nThough deep down, Red genuinely does care about Eric's friends, he doesn't\nlike them frequently hanging out in his home. One of his favorite phrases to\ndescribe Eric and his friends is \"dumbass\". He also threatens the teens that\nhe will put his \"foot in your ass\". In the finale, he claims that he once put\nhis foot in someone's ass in [Iwo Jima](/wiki/Iwo_Jima \"Iwo Jima\"), but his\nrefusal to further elaborate on the experience implies that it was not\nsomething he's proud of. His antagonism towards the teenagers is mainly\nbecause Red prefers peace and quiet, believing that since he has worked hard\nand raised his children, he deserves time to himself and with Kitty. With\nregards to his neighbors Bob and Midge Pinciotti, it is indicated that Red\nused to enjoy their friendship before they started to get involved \"into every\nfad there is\". Even though he feels that Bob is a \"good neighbor and a good\nfriend\", he gets easily annoyed in Bob's presence.\n\nHe is a tough, no-nonsense father and tends to favor his daughter Laurie (Lisa\nRobin Kelly & Christina Moore) and foster son Hyde (Danny Masterson) over his\nson Eric (Topher Grace), whom he considers soft, skinny, twitchy and wimpy. He\nalways sees Laurie as \"a giant apple\" instead of the mean-spirited,\npromiscuous person she truly is, but becomes wiser to her in the second season\nafter finding out she lied to him about moving in with a friend when she was\nreally living with a young man. In one episode, Kitty asks Red why he is so\ntough on Eric, only to have Red respond, \"The same reason my old man was so\ntough on me\", indicating that he went through a similar childhood to Eric's.\nThough Red often puts his own son down because he wants him to \"be a man like\nhimself\", it cannot be denied that Eric is merely a younger version of his\nfather in the sense that both have a very dry sense of humor and tend to be\nthe sanest persons in their respective circles of friends. On a few occasions\nin season one, Red shows Eric affection. When the two return from a wrestling\nmatch, they wrestle for a bit before Red gave Eric a hug. Later on, when Red's\nmother dies, Red calls Eric over for a hug with him and Kitty in a family\nmoment. In the final episode of season seven, as Eric is leaving for Africa,\nRed has a real heart-to-heart talk with Eric, in which he admitted he loved\nhim and that he would miss him, culminating in a hug between father and son.\nIn the season 8 premiere, Kitty tries to get Red to say something nice for\nEric on the tape recorder. Red consistently refuses and appears to revel in\nEric being gone. However, when Kitty questions his feelings on the matter, Red\nadmitted that he honestly missed Eric. (Unbeknownst to Red, though, Kitty\nsecretly recorded him saying this). Red also seems to respect his son's\nresistance as shown when he told Eric he respected him for staying with Donna\ndespite Red's efforts.\n\nMost of the time, Red treats Eric's friend [Hyde](/wiki/Steven_Hyde \"Steven\nHyde\") ([Danny Masterson](/wiki/Danny_Masterson \"Danny Masterson\")), who moved\nin with the Formans' at the end of the first season, better than he treats his\nown son; perhaps this is because Red thinks Hyde needs a father figure as his\nown left him. Red also shows appreciation to Hyde for his mechanical skills,\nevident from when he opened his own muffler store. Hyde quickly assembles\nmuffler displays, while Eric is putting up decorations. Also, Red often more\nreadily has heart-to-hearts with Hyde than with Eric. When Hyde is arrested\nfor possession of marijuana (which had actually belonged to Jackie), he wanted\nto throw Hyde out, but soon had a change of heart and let him stay after\nlearning the truth. However, this doesn't stop Red from giving Hyde an\nextremely long scolding. Hyde assumed the Forman's would want him to move out\non his eighteenth birthday because all of Hyde's relatives had to move out of\ntheir places when they were eighteen. Red told Hyde that he needed to stay at\nthe Forman's house so he would not end up like his relatives (who were either\ndead, in jail, or \"pumping gas\"). Much of this comes from Hyde's troubled\nbackground and Red's view that Hyde just needs some direction in life.\n\nOn the other hand, a few instances have shown that Red still cares about Eric,\nand it is clear that Red's being hard on him is Red's way of trying to toughen\nEric up to prepare him for the real world (he once stated that, as Eric's\nfather, it was his job to make Eric a man, \"which he's not\"). Red once told\nEric, \"I love you\", but he was drugged after a visit to the dentist. After\nEric later said it back and some awkwardness ensued, Red said that you should\nonly say that when you're drunk, dying or in trouble—\"Otherwise, it's just a\ngiven\".\n\nLike Kitty, Red is often forced to act as a parental figure for Eric's friends\n[Kelso](/wiki/Michael_Kelso \"Michael Kelso\") ([Ashton\nKutcher](/wiki/Ashton_Kutcher \"Ashton Kutcher\")),\n[Fez](/wiki/Fez_\\(That_%2770s_Show\\) \"Fez \\(That '70s Show\\)\") ([Wilmer\nValderrama](/wiki/Wilmer_Valderrama \"Wilmer Valderrama\")),\n[Jackie](/wiki/Jackie_Burkhart \"Jackie Burkhart\") ([Mila\nKunis](/wiki/Mila_Kunis \"Mila Kunis\")), [Hyde](/wiki/Steven_Hyde \"Steven\nHyde\") ([Danny Masterson](/wiki/Danny_Masterson \"Danny Masterson\")) and\n[Donna](/wiki/Donna_Pinciotti \"Donna Pinciotti\") ([Laura\nPrepon](/wiki/Laura_Prepon \"Laura Prepon\"))—albeit reluctantly. He usually\nonly helps out at Kitty's insistence or simply to get the teens out of his\nhouse. Red actually likes Donna, mostly because he thinks that if Eric has a\nson with her he will be good at sports and both freely and cheerily admits she\nis too good for his own son, and also that if Eric and Donna get married Eric\nwill leave the house. Red has a low opinion of Kelso and Fez, calling Kelso a\n\"Kettlehead\" and referring to Fez as the \"foreign kid\", and sometimes by the\ngeneric names of \"Haji\", \"Sabu\", \"Ali Baba\", \"Tutankhamun\" or \"Anwar\".\nHowever, he has bonded with them both a few times throughout the series, such\nas when he cooperated with Kelso to change the [Pong](/wiki/Pong \"Pong\")\nelectronic game so they can make the paddles smaller, thus making the game\nmore fun. Red also bonded with Fez when he gave Fez advice that it is not a\ngood idea to mix women and alcohol together. Early on, Red stated that Jackie\nis his favorite out of all of Eric's friends. He says unlike the others, she\nis \"not useless\" because she perfectly held a flashlight for him while he\nworked on his car, while Eric was incapable of this simple task. Jackie has\nhugged Red on a few occasions, at least half of which he returned.\n\nIn the final season, Red takes a liking to Hyde's new friend and co-worker,\nRandy Pearson ([Josh Meyers](/wiki/Josh_Meyers_\\(actor\\) \"Josh Meyers\n\\(actor\\)\")). Red respects Randy simply because he's the polar opposite of\nEric: masculine, crafty and not at all obsessed with _[Star\nWars](/wiki/Star_Wars \"Star Wars\")_ (though in one episode, it is shown that\nRandy is indeed a fan). Unlike Kitty, Red had no problem with him starting a\nrelationship with Donna.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Forman&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1.
