She\nalso played the character for two months in that show's short-lived [spin\noff](/wiki/Spin-off_\\(media\\) \"Spin-off \\(media\\)\") _[The\nCity](/wiki/The_City_\\(1995_TV_series\\) \"The City \\(1995 TV series\\)\")_ from\nNovember 1995 until January 1996. In 1994 she was nominated for a [Soap Opera\nDigest Award](/wiki/Soap_Opera_Digest_Awards \"Soap Opera Digest Awards\") for\n\"Outstanding Female Newcomer\".\n\nThrough the 1990s she appeared in many [made for TV\nmovies](/wiki/Television_movie \"Television movie\"), as well as a role in the\n1999 [Steven Soderbergh](/wiki/Steven_Soderbergh \"Steven Soderbergh\") film,\n_[The Limey](/wiki/The_Limey \"The Limey\")_ , as [Peter\nFonda](/wiki/Peter_Fonda \"Peter Fonda\")'s girlfriend. She appeared in the\nmusic video for \"I Will Buy You a New Life\" by\n[Everclear](/wiki/Everclear_\\(band\\) \"Everclear \\(band\\)\").\n\nIn 2001 she returned to the world of daytime television, this time in the role\nof [Mia Saunders](/wiki/Mia_Saunders \"Mia Saunders\") on _[All My\nChildren](/wiki/All_My_Children \"All My Children\")_ , the heretofore unknown\nhalf-sister of [Liza Colby](/wiki/Liza_Colby \"Liza Colby\") ([Marcy\nWalker](/wiki/Marcy_Walker \"Marcy Walker\")). Although she started as a front-\nburner character, her romantic pairing with [Jake\nMartin](/wiki/Jake_Martin_\\(All_My_Children\\) \"Jake Martin \\(All My\nChildren\\)\") ([J. Eddie Peck](/wiki/J._Eddie_Peck \"J. Eddie Peck\")) didn't\nwork out because of the actor's exit from the show, and so Mia was limited to\nbeing a background character. In 2004, Heinle opted not to renew her contract\nwith _All My Children_ and left the show.\n\nOn March 21, 2005, Heinle joined the cast of the [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") [soap\nopera](/wiki/Soap_opera \"Soap opera\") _[The Young and the\nRestless](/wiki/The_Young_and_the_Restless \"The Young and the Restless\")_ , as\n[Victoria Newman](/wiki/Victoria_Newman \"Victoria Newman\"), replacing the\npopular [Heather Tom](/wiki/Heather_Tom \"Heather Tom\") in the role. She won a\n[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama\nSeries](/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Supporting_Actress_in_a_Drama_Series\n\"Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series\") in\n2014 and again in 2015[4] for the role.\n\nIn April 2009 Heinle appeared in season 4, episode 20, of _[Ghost\nWhisperer](/wiki/Ghost_Whisperer \"Ghost Whisperer\")_ , entitled \"Stage\nFright\", with husband [Thad Luckinbill](/wiki/Thad_Luckinbill \"Thad\nLuckinbill\") and fellow daytime drama actress [Lesli Kay](/wiki/Lesli_Kay\n\"Lesli Kay\").\n\n## Personal\nlife[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amelia_Heinle&action=edit&section=3&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Personal life\")]\n\nIn February 1995, she married her _[Loving](/wiki/Loving_\\(TV_series\\) \"Loving\n\\(TV series\\)\")_ co-star and on-screen love interest, [Michael\nWeatherly](/wiki/Michael_Weatherly \"Michael Weatherly\"), who played the role\nof \"Cooper Alden\". On January 10, 1996, Heinle gave birth to her first child,\na son. She and Weatherly divorced in 1997.\n\nIn March 2007 she married her _Young and the Restless_ co-star, Thad\nLuckinbill, notable for portraying her onscreen ex-husband, [J.T.\nHellstrom](/wiki/J.T._Hellstrom \"J.T.
