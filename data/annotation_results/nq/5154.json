Stan decides to\nscare Hayley straight by dressing up as a spider when she comes home, but\nHayley defends herself against Stan and says that she is going to see [My\nMorning Jacket](/wiki/My_Morning_Jacket \"My Morning Jacket\") when they play\nthe next evening. Stan swallows Hayley's ticket, but\n[Francine](/wiki/Francine_Smith \"Francine Smith\") later retrieves it from\nStan's body using tongs, then reminisces with Hayley about her own concert-\ngoing days, remarking on how hard she had to work to get backstage. While\nHayley is at the concert Francine has [Roger](/wiki/Roger_\\(American_Dad!\\)\n\"Roger \\(American Dad!\\)\") dress up as Hayley. Stan does not notice at first,\nbut the ruse fails when Francine calls Roger by name. Stan races to the\nconcert, only to find himself entranced by the music.\n\nStan becomes obsessed with My Morning Jacket and decides to meet [Jim\nJames](/wiki/Jim_James \"Jim James\"), believing they are soul mates and that\nJames is writing the music specifically for him. Disguised as a reporter for\n_[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ (an allusion to the\nfilm _[Almost Famous](/wiki/Almost_Famous \"Almost Famous\")_), Stan follows My\nMorning Jacket on tour, accompanied by Roger. Roger manages to get Stan\nbackstage at a show and onto the tour bus, but when Stan tells a bogus story\nabout freebasing cocaine with 'Tina Jivestrong' & 'the black guy from [The\nBeatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The Beatles\")', they get thrown off the bus. Roger\nsteals a car to get them to the next concert in [Albany, New\nYork](/wiki/Albany,_New_York \"Albany, New York\"). However, Stan does not get\nthrough the backstage entrance after Roger abandons him.\n\nDeciding to help Stan and end his quest, Francine turns up, dressed as a\ngroupie. She effortlessly flirts and flashes her way through numerous security\ncheckpoints, progressing from a simple hair-flip through lifting her shirt to\nlifting her skirt and finally making out with the last guard, a woman. Stan\nmeets [Jim James](/wiki/Jim_James \"Jim James\"), who, after being freaked out\nby Stan, points out the flaws in his logic and tells him that he could not\npossibly be writing his songs just for him, seeing as how they never knew each\nother, and that Francine is the one who truly understands him. The episode\nends with Francine and Stan rekindling their passion for each other (still in\nJim James's dressing room) with the female security guard coming in the room\nto join them, closing the door behind her.\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=My_Morning_Straitjacket&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nIn a November 2009, interview the episode's writer [Mike\nBarker](/wiki/Mike_Barker_\\(producer\\) \"Mike Barker \\(producer\\)\") spoke about\nhow an experience at the [2008 Bonnaroo Music\nFestival](/wiki/2008_Bonnaroo_Music_Festival \"2008 Bonnaroo Music Festival\")\ninspired the episode, saying: \"At Bonnaroo, I’m watching these guys create\nthis lush, intense sound as the rain is washing over them… and as the sheet of\nrain attacks the stage, the raindrops are being illuminated by the multi-\ncolored stage lights, and it was just… biblical. And it was one of those\nmoments — and by moment I don’t mean during a certain chorus or something, I\nmean the entire time the guys are playing — it was one of those moments where\neveryone in attendance realized they were witnessing something really special.\nNo one’s worried about getting wet, or getting their shoes muddy, or needing\nto sit down after standing shoulder to shoulder with wet strangers for four\nstraight hours. And I actually remember having the thought, “If lightning\nstrikes these guys dead, there’s not a thing tragic about that.” Seriously,\ncan you tell me a better way for a musician to go? Because I can’t think of\nit. But during the show, I start to become aware of how intensely I loved this\nmusic, and by extension, these guys for playing it. And I thought to myself,\n“What if I try to share this experience through the characters in _American\nDad_? Is it possible to translate how much I love this music to a large\nportion of _American Dad_ ’s audience that presently has no idea that this\nband even exists?” That would be my way of giving back, I suppose. My Morning\nJacket is one of the greatest bands of all time, so why wouldn’t I try to\nshare that fact?\"[2]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Mike_Barker_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg/220px-\nMike_Barker_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mike_Barker_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mike_Barker_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[American Dad!](/wiki/American_Dad! \"American Dad!\")_ co-creator [Mike\nBarker](/wiki/Mike_Barker_\\(producer\\) \"Mike Barker \\(producer\\)\") wrote the\nepisode.\n\nHe also spoke about producing the episode, saying: \"I was definitely conscious\nof the fact that the band could end up hating this episode and resenting me\nfor not delivering like I had assured them I would. I mean, it’s tricky.\nNormally when we (the writers) make our episodes, our primary rule is that we\nhave to make ourselves laugh. We have to find the episode interesting and\nfunny. Because if we’re laughing, then there’s a good chance our audience is\nlaughing, too. But with this episode… well, suddenly there’s this entirely new\nsegment of people that will be watching the show, many of them for the first\ntime, and that’s the My Morning Jacket fans. And the fans have certain\nthoughts and feelings about both the music, as well as the guys making it. The\nlast thing I want is for my episode — which is really a pretty personal\ncreative experiment — is for it to somehow reflect negatively back on the\nband. Jim and the guys were really great at respecting my autonomy throughout\nthe process. This is a story I wanted to tell, and basically they took a big\nleap of faith by entrusting me, this absolute stranger, with their music,\ntheir voices, and ultimately, their image. So perhaps the most important thing\nfor me in regards to the band was to do everything in my power to make sure\nthat the episode didn’t suck. Because if it’s bad, or embarrassing, then that\nleads to questions from the fans like “Why would MMJ do this?” and suddenly\nthis incredibly thoughtful and principled band is on the firing line for\nselling out or something.\"[2]\n\nHe also spoke about if the band had any input on their character designs,\nsaying: \"We gave the band customary consultation and they signed off on all of\nthe artwork we ran by them. It’s always tricky animating real people. Because\nyou’re not just animating them to resemble who they are in real life, you also\nhave to make sure they resemble characters that live in the _American Dad_\nuniverse, and that carries with it a whole host of challenging parameters for\nour animators. But I think our character designers did a great job at\ncapturing Jim and the guys.\"[2]\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=My_Morning_Straitjacket&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nTodd VanDerWerff of _[The A.V. Club](/wiki/The_A.V._Club \"The A.V. Club\")_\ngave the episode a B+, saying \"Good old reliable _American Dad_ was again the\nbest of the bunch, though I suspect I would have liked this episode a lot more\nif I had any real knowledge about My Morning Jacket, a band I always mean to\nget into but never do. The show seems to do a lot of plots where Stan is\nintroduced to some new craze by one of the supporting characters and then he\ngoes nuts for it, but it's usually funny because Stan is such a straitlaced\ncharacter. So his obsession with the band, which seemed like it would stop\nbeing funny roughly a minute after it was introduced, kept getting weirder and\nweirder and funnier and funnier.\"[3] The episode was watched by a total of\n5.52 million people, this made it the fourth most watched show on [Animation\nDomination](/wiki/Animation_Domination \"Animation Domination\") that night,\nlosing to _[The Cleveland Show](/wiki/The_Cleveland_Show \"The Cleveland\nShow\")_ , _[The Simpsons](/wiki/The_Simpsons \"The Simpsons\")_ and _[Family\nGuy](/wiki/Family_Guy \"Family Guy\")_ with 7.38 million.[4]\n\n##\nMusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=My_Morning_Straitjacket&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\nThe songs featured in the episode are \"Touch Me I'm Going to Scream Part 2\",\n\"I'm Amazed\", \"Remnants\", and \"Highly Suspicious\" from the album _[Evil\nUrges](/wiki/Evil_Urges \"Evil Urges\")_ , and \"Phone Went West\" from _[At\nDawn](/wiki/At_Dawn \"At Dawn\")_. The song most prominently featured in the\nepisode is \"Wordless Chorus\" from _[Z](/wiki/Z_\\(My_Morning_Jacket_album\\) \"Z\n\\(My Morning Jacket album\\)\")_. A live performance of the song taken from the\nconcert film _[Okonokos](/wiki/Okonokos \"Okonokos\")_ plays over the ending\ncredits.
