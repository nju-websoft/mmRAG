In response to this injustice,\nthe singers remind the villain of their importance and fame: \"Listen to the\nradio! Don't you remember? We built this city on [rock and\nroll!](/wiki/Rock_music \"Rock music\")\" A spoken-word interlude explicitly\nmentions the [Golden Gate Bridge](/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge \"Golden Gate\nBridge\") and refers to \"the city by the bay\", a common moniker for Starship's\nhometown of [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\"); Starship's\npredecessors, [Jefferson Airplane](/wiki/Jefferson_Airplane \"Jefferson\nAirplane\") and [Jefferson Starship](/wiki/Jefferson_Starship \"Jefferson\nStarship\"), were prominent members of San Francisco's [psychedelic\nrock](/wiki/Psychedelic_rock \"Psychedelic rock\") scene in the late 1960s and\ninto the 1970s. However, the interlude then rapidly refers to the same city as\n\"the city that rocks\", a reference to [Cleveland, Ohio](/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio\n\"Cleveland, Ohio\") (home of the [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and\nMuseum](/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum \"Rock and Roll Hall of\nFame and Museum\")), and then \"the city that never sleeps\", one of the\nnicknames for [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\").\nCapitalizing on the ambiguity, several radio stations added descriptions of\ntheir own local areas when they broadcast the song, or even simply added their\nown [ident](/wiki/Station_identification \"Station identification\") in its\nplace.[2]\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Built_This_City&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nThe song was engineered by producer [Bill Bottrell](/wiki/Bill_Bottrell \"Bill\nBottrell\") and arranged by Bottrell and [Jasun Martz](/wiki/Jasun_Martz \"Jasun\nMartz\").\n\nThe song features [Mickey Thomas](/wiki/Mickey_Thomas_\\(singer\\) \"Mickey\nThomas \\(singer\\)\") and [Grace Slick](/wiki/Grace_Slick \"Grace Slick\") sharing\nlead vocals. [MTV](/wiki/MTV \"MTV\") executive and former DJ [Les\nGarland](/wiki/Les_Garland \"Les Garland\") provided the DJ voice-over during\nthe song's bridge.[3]\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Built_This_City&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\n\"We Built This City\" received a [Grammy Award](/wiki/Grammy_Award \"Grammy\nAward\") nomination for [Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or\nGroup](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Rock_Performance_by_a_Duo_or_Group_with_Vocal\n\"Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal\") in\n1986.[4]\n\n### _Blender_ magazine's \"50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs\nEver\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Built_This_City&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Blender magazine's \"50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever\"\")]\n\nThe defunct magazine _[Blender](/wiki/Blender_\\(magazine\\) \"Blender\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ 's ranking of the song as the worst song ever was in\nconjunction with a [VH1](/wiki/VH1 \"VH1\") Special of _The 50 Most Awesomely\nBad Songs...Ever_.[5] In order to qualify for the distinction, the songs on\nthe list had to be a popular hit at some point, thus disqualifying many songs\nthat would by consensus be considered much worse. _Blender_ editor Craig Marks\nsaid of the song, \"It purports to be anti-commercial but reeks of '80s\n[corporate-rock](/wiki/Arena_rock \"Arena rock\") commercialism. It's a real\nreflection of what practically killed rock music in the '80s.\"[6]\n\nHowever, an article in the _[Sydney Morning\nHerald](/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald \"Sydney Morning Herald\")_ pointed out that\n\"_Blender '_s list—compiled via an arbitrary and anecdotal data collection\nprocess and ranked by Marks—included several whimsical criteria. One was to go\neasy on [novelty songs](/wiki/Novelty_song \"Novelty song\"). In a discussion\nwith the band's manager, Bill Thompson, he was surprised at the ranking, but\nalso \"thrilled\" because of the other high-profile groups on the list, saying,\n\"I wish Blender had called us for a group shot. I'd love to have my picture\ntaken with [Stevie Wonder](/wiki/Stevie_Wonder \"Stevie Wonder\") and [Paul\nMcCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\").\"[7] [Mickey\nThomas](/wiki/Mickey_Thomas_\\(singer\\) \"Mickey Thomas \\(singer\\)\"), one of the\nsingers of Starship, said in 2010 regarding the review from the by-then folded\n_Blender_ magazine,\n\n> From what I heard, they got so much flak about it that they sort of\n> retracted their statements in a way about the song. And not only that, but\n> _Blender '_s folded, and we're still here.[8]\n\nWhen asked about why the song was listed as #1 on the review, the editor of\n_Blender_ magazine, Craig Marks, referenced the line of the song \"Marconi\nplays the mamba\" by asking,\n\n> Who is [Marconi](/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi \"Guglielmo Marconi\")? And what is\n> the [mamba](/wiki/Mamba \"Mamba\")? The mamba is the deadliest snake in the\n> world, so he must have meant the [mambo](/wiki/Mambo_\\(music\\) \"Mambo\n> \\(music\\)\"), but it sounds so much like 'mamba' that every lyric web site\n> writes it that way. It makes sense neither way.\"[7]\n\nThe _[Richmond Times-Dispatch](/wiki/Richmond_Times-Dispatch \"Richmond Times-\nDispatch\")_ listed other songs by Starship that would have made more sense for\nbeing on the top of the list than \"We Built This City,\" concluding,\n\n> No, no. They chose the song that references Marconi, the father of the\n> radio. The song that inserted a cool snippet of DJ chatter from the band's\n> beloved San Francisco. The song that found Grace Slick enunciating the\n> phrase \"corporation games\" with nutty abandon.[9]\n\n### _Rolling Stone_ Top Ten Worst Songs of the\n1980s[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Built_This_City&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Rolling Stone Top Ten Worst Songs of the 1980s\")]\n\nIn 2011 a _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ magazine\nonline readers poll named \"We Built This City\" as the worst song of the 1980s.\nThe song's winning margin was so large that the magazine reported it \"could be\nthe biggest blow-out victory in the history of the _Rolling Stone_ Readers\nPoll\".[10]\n\n### _GQ_ Worst Song of All\nTime[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Built_This_City&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: GQ Worst Song of All Time\")]\n\nIn August 2016, Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine declared this song as the worst\nof all time, referring to it as \"the most detested song in human history\".[11]\nThe article covered [Bernie Taupin](/wiki/Bernie_Taupin \"Bernie Taupin\")'s\nrole in writing an early version of the song, the backlash against a video\nthat no one liked, and Grace Slick's inconsistent statements about whether she\nliked it or not.\n\n## Charts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Built_This_City&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Charts\")]\n\nChart (1985–1986) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nAustralia ([ARIA](/wiki/ARIA \"ARIA\")) | 1  \nAustria ([Ö3 Austria Top 40](/wiki/%C3%963_Austria_Top_40 \"Ö3 Austria Top 40\"))[12] | 21  \nBelgium ([VRT Top 30](/wiki/VRT_Top_30 \"VRT Top 30\") Flanders)[13] | 17  \nCanada ([RPM](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\"))[14] | 1  \nGermany ([Official German Charts](/wiki/GfK_Entertainment_Charts \"GfK Entertainment Charts\"))[15] | 10  \nIreland ([IRMA](/wiki/Irish_Recorded_Music_Association \"Irish Recorded Music Association\"))[16] | 9  \nNetherlands ([Dutch Top 40](/wiki/Dutch_Top_40 \"Dutch Top 40\"))[17] | 21  \nNew Zealand ([Recorded Music NZ](/wiki/Recorded_Music_NZ \"Recorded Music NZ\"))[18] | 11  \nSweden ([Sverigetopplistan](/wiki/Sverigetopplistan \"Sverigetopplistan\"))[19] | 4  \nSwitzerland ([Schweizer Hitparade](/wiki/Swiss_Hitparade \"Swiss Hitparade\"))[20] | 8  \nUnited Kingdom ([The Official Charts Company](/wiki/The_Official_Charts_Company \"The Official Charts Company\"))[21] | 12  \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[22] | 1  \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks](/wiki/Hot_Adult_Contemporary_Tracks \"Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks\") | 37  \nChart (2014) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nUnited Kingdom ([The Official Charts Company](/wiki/The_Official_Charts_Company \"The Official Charts Company\"))[23] | 25  \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Built_This_City&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – May 28, 2015\"](http://www.riaa.org/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database).
