She dated both\n[Flash Thompson](/wiki/Flash_Thompson \"Flash Thompson\") and [Harry\nOsborn](/wiki/Harry_Osborn \"Harry Osborn\") to make Peter jealous. Gradually,\nhowever, a romance developed; Gwen, a science major, appreciated Peter's\nintellect. Their relationship began almost immediately after Peter stopped\ngoing out with [Mary Jane Watson](/wiki/Mary_Jane_Watson \"Mary Jane Watson\"),\nwhom he began to see as shallow and self-absorbed.[_[volume & issue\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]\n\nLater issues introduced Gwen's father, NYPD Captain [George\nStacy](/wiki/George_Stacy \"George Stacy\"). Though her father was both fond of\nPeter and supportive of his alter-ego Spider-Man, he ultimately strained\nPeter's relationship with Gwen after being killed by falling debris during a\nbattle involving Spider-Man and [Doctor Octopus](/wiki/Doctor_Octopus \"Doctor\nOctopus\").[5][6] Gwen blamed Spider-Man for his death, and left for Europe to\ncope with her loss. She wanted Peter to ask her to marry him and convince her\nto stay, but his guilt stopped him from proposing.[_[volume & issue\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] Gwen's\nfeelings for Peter eventually prompted her to return to New York, and their\nrelationship was rekindled.[7]\n\nAccording to Lee, who scripted all of the stories featuring Gwen Stacy up to\nthis point, the original intent was for Gwen Stacy to be Spider-Man's central\nlove interest, \"but no matter how we [i.e. Lee and his artist/co-plotter\ncollaborators] wrote it, Mary Jane always seemed more interesting!\"[8][9]\n\n### Death[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gwen_Stacy&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Death\")]\n\nMain article: [The Night Gwen Stacy Died](/wiki/The_Night_Gwen_Stacy_Died \"The\nNight Gwen Stacy Died\")\n\n[Gerry Conway](/wiki/Gerry_Conway \"Gerry Conway\") and [Roy\nThomas](/wiki/Roy_Thomas \"Roy Thomas\") succeeded Stan Lee as writer and\neditor, respectively, of _The Amazing Spider-Man_. Together with inker [John\nRomita, Sr.](/wiki/John_Romita,_Sr. \"John Romita, Sr.\"), they came to the\ndecision to have Gwen Stacy killed off.[10] It was Romita who first suggested\nthe idea, during a plotting session with Conway when Romita was still\npenciller on _The Amazing Spider-Man_.[11] Conway later said his contribution\nto the decision was motivated by a desire to bring Mary Jane Watson to the\nforefront,[11][12] as he shared Lee's feeling that she was a more interesting\ncharacter than Gwen Stacy: \"[Mary Jane] hadn't lost the edge that made her an\ninteresting character. Gwen didn't have an edge. She was just a nice\nperson.\"[13]\n\nThe [Green Goblin](/wiki/Green_Goblin \"Green Goblin\") kidnaps Gwen Stacy and\nthrows her off the [George Washington Bridge](/wiki/George_Washington_Bridge\n\"George Washington Bridge\") in [_The Amazing Spider-Man_\n#121](/wiki/The_Night_Gwen_Stacy_Died \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\") (June\n1973). Both the decision to kill Gwen and the method in which Marvel\nimplemented it remain controversial among fans because some believe that Peter\nhimself was the one who caused her death. The death became a pivotal point in\nboth Spider-Man’s history and in [American comic\nbooks](/wiki/American_comic_book \"American comic book\") in general. Many point\nto Gwen's death as the end of the [Silver Age of\nComics](/wiki/Silver_Age_of_Comics \"Silver Age of Comics\").[14] Before her\ndeath, except possibly as part of an origin story, superheroes did not fail so\ncatastrophically, nor did the hero's loved ones die so suddenly and without\nwarning.[15][16][17]\n\nIn his book _[The Physics of Superheroes](/wiki/The_Physics_of_Superheroes\n\"The Physics of Superheroes\")_ , physicist [James\nKakalios](/wiki/James_Kakalios \"James Kakalios\") writes that, consistent with\n[Newton's laws of motion](/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion \"Newton's laws of\nmotion\"), the sudden stop would have killed Gwen Stacy.[18] The comic book\n_Civil War: Casualties of War: Captain America/Iron Man_ (2007) concurred that\nthe proximate cause of death was the sudden stop during a high-speed fall. An\nissue of _Peter Parker/Spider-Man_ revisits the issue, and further confirms\nGwen died of a broken neck due to the use of the webbing.[_[volume & issue\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] On the\nother hand, in the 1987 edition of the _[Official Handbook of the Marvel\nUniverse](/wiki/Official_Handbook_of_the_Marvel_Universe \"Official Handbook of\nthe Marvel Universe\")_ , Gwen’s death is attributed to the fall, not to\nSpider-Man’s webbing.\n\nWithin the [Marvel Comics](/wiki/Marvel_Comics \"Marvel Comics\"), Gwen Stacy's\ndeath has enormous repercussions. [Mary Jane Watson](/wiki/Mary_Jane_Watson\n\"Mary Jane Watson\") feels the loss of Gwen deeply and becomes a more mature,\ncompassionate person. Gwen's death also draws Peter and Mary Jane into a\ncloser friendship, and eventually to romance.[_[volume & issue\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] Miles\nWarren, one of Gwen's professors, was secretly in love with her. Following her\ndeath, Warren goes insane and adopts the persona of the\n[Jackal](/wiki/Jackal_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Jackal \\(Marvel Comics\\)\").[19] In\nthe fourth and final issue of the miniseries _[Marvels](/wiki/Marvels\n\"Marvels\")_ (April 1994), photographer Phil Sheldon befriends Gwen Stacy, who\nhas absolved Spider-Man of any blame for her father's death. Gwen's simple\nfaith in heroes convinces Sheldon of the purpose of the \"Marvels\" (i.e.,\nsuperheroes)—to protect innocents such as Gwen. He resolves to write a book to\npraise the heroes and what they should mean to humanity. When the Green Goblin\nkidnaps Gwen and holds her hostage to bait Spider-Man, Sheldon frantically\nfollows the resulting chase in a taxi and witnesses her death. While it is\nreported that she died from the shock of the fall, Sheldon thinks it looks\nlike something else. Sheldon's faith in the Marvels is shattered.[20]\n\n### Clones[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gwen_Stacy&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Clones\")]\n\nFollowing the publication of _The Amazing Spider-Man_ #121, Stan Lee (who had\nsince become Marvel's publisher) was frequently criticized by fans during his\npublic appearances for killing off Gwen Stacy.[12] Lee, who had also found the\ncharacter's death objectionable,[10] insisted that Conway write a story\nbringing her back.[12] Conway strongly objected since he felt any sort of\nresurrection would break the plausibility of the stories, but ultimately gave\nin under the condition that after reviving Gwen, he could write her out of the\nbook as soon as he wanted.[13] He decided that cloning would be the best means\nto bring the character back.\n\nIn the resulting story, set approximately two years after Gwen Stacy's\ndeath,[21] \"Gwen\" reappears, perfectly healthy but with no memory of the time\nsince her death. This story, published in _Amazing Spider-Man_ #144 (May\n1975), initiated the [original Clone\nSaga](/wiki/Clone_Saga#The_original_Clone_Saga \"Clone Saga\"). At the end of\nthat story, Gwen's clone, a creation of Spider-Man villain the\n[Jackal](/wiki/Jackal_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Jackal \\(Marvel Comics\\)\"), leaves to\nfind a new life for herself, coming to accept that she is not really the same\nperson who had a relationship with Peter Parker.[22]\n\nIn the 1988 crossover \"[The Evolutionary War](/wiki/The_Evolutionary_War \"The\nEvolutionary War\")\", the [High Evolutionary](/wiki/High_Evolutionary \"High\nEvolutionary\"), who had once been Miles Warren's teacher, captures Gwen's\nclone. He is dismayed to learn that Miles Warren has perfected the art of\ncloning and thus lies to the New Men that it was nothing more than a genetic\nconstruct created by a virus that he injected into his apprentice, Joyce\nDelaney.[_[volume & issue needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]\n\nDuring the second \"[Clone Saga](/wiki/Clone_Saga \"Clone Saga\")\", Gwen Stacy's\nclone, now married to a clone of Professor Warren named Warren Miles, sees a\ncopy of Peter Parker's book of Spider-Man photos, _Webs_ , and remembers (to\nan extent) her real history. She returns to New York City. During this\nstoryline, she again disappears from Spider-Man's life. It was revealed the\nGwen Stacy clone introduced in _Amazing Spider-Man_ #144 was in fact the\nsecond Gwen clone Miles Warren created and has been living in London under the\nname Joyce Delaney. This clone is murdered by the Gwen Stacy clone known as\nAbby-L.[23]\n\nAnother Gwen clone appears in _The Amazing Spider-Man_ #399 (March 1995). This\nclone believes she is the real Gwen.[_[volume & issue\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] She dies\nfrom clone degeneration in _Spider-Man_ #56 (March 1995), the next issue of\nthe story arc.[_[volume & issue needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]\n\nA further Gwen clone appears in the \"Sibling Rivalry\" crossover storyline\nbetween _[Superior Spider-Man Team-Up](/wiki/Superior_Spider-Man_Team-Up\n\"Superior Spider-Man Team-Up\")_ and _[Scarlet Spider](/wiki/Scarlet_Spider\n\"Scarlet Spider\")_. She joins the Jackal (alongside\n[Carrion](/wiki/Carrion_\\(comics\\) \"Carrion \\(comics\\)\") and a regular Miles\nWarren clone) in capturing [Superior Spider-Man](/wiki/Superior_Spider-Man\n\"Superior Spider-Man\") and [Kaine](/wiki/Kaine_Parker \"Kaine Parker\").[24] She\nis sympathetic towards \"Peter\" and Kaine, but at the same time utterly loyal\nto the Jackal. When the Spiders break free, Superior Spider-Man disarms and\nattempts to kill her, but is stopped by Kaine. When the Jackal's lab is\nengulfed in flames, Kaine offers to save her, but she refuses, and is\nseemingly consumed by the fire.[25]\n\n### \"Sins Past\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gwen_Stacy&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: \"Sins Past\"\")]\n\nThe story arc \"Sins Past\" by [J. Michael\nStraczynski](/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski \"J. Michael Straczynski\") in _The\nAmazing Spider-Man_ #509–514 (August 2004–January 2005) reveals [Norman\nOsborn](/wiki/Norman_Osborn \"Norman Osborn\"), the Green Goblin's alter ego,\nfathered twins, a boy and a girl, with Gwen Stacy, to whom she gave birth\nwhile in [France](/wiki/France \"France\") shortly before her death. She vowed\nshe would raise them with Peter (despite the fact that he was not aware of\nGwen's infidelity) and refused to allow Norman access to them. Seeing her as a\nthreat to his potential heirs, the Green Goblin killed Gwen. Norman Osborn\nthen raised Gwen's two children, a boy and a girl named [Gabriel and\nSarah](/wiki/Gabriel_Stacy_and_Sarah_Stacy \"Gabriel Stacy and Sarah\nStacy\").[_[volume & issue needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]\n\nStraczynski later stated he originally wanted to make Peter Parker the father\nof Gwen's kids but the editors vetoed the idea. They felt it would age Peter\nParker too much if he had two adult children. The whole creative and editorial\nteam then decided Norman Osborn would be the father.[26] In an e-mail to the\ncomic book website [Newsarama](/wiki/Newsarama \"Newsarama\"), Straczynski\nclaimed he regretted the version of \"Sins Past\" that went to press, and he had\nhoped to \"[retcon](/wiki/Retcon \"Retcon\")\" it out of continuity during the\nevents of the then-recent \"[One More Day](/wiki/Spider-Man:_One_More_Day\n\"Spider-Man: One More Day\")\" storyline: \"I wanted to retcon the Gwen twins out\nof continuity, which was something I always assumed I could do at the end of\nmy run. I wasn't allowed to do this, and yes, it pissed me off.\"[27] In the\noriginal plans for \"One More Day\", the story would have ended with Gwen Stacy\nbeing resurrected by Mephisto's reality-warping spell along with Harry Osborn,\nbut it was eventually decided to let her remain dead. Her son, Gabriel, has\nreappeared in subsequent stories.\n\n### Dead No More: The Clone\nConspiracy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gwen_Stacy&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy\")]\n\nIn the _[Clone Conspiracy](/wiki/Dead_No_More:_The_Clone_Conspiracy \"Dead No\nMore: The Clone Conspiracy\")_ storyline, a flashback revealed that Gwen Stacy\nwas conscious during Spider-Man and Green Goblin's battle on the bridge, and\nas she was falling to her death. She overheard their conversation and\ndiscovered Peter is Spider-Man. She was angry at Peter for keeping this secret\nand for his involvement in her father's death.[28]\n\nIn the present, Gwen is supposedly revived by the [Jackal](/wiki/Ben_Reilly\n\"Ben Reilly\") with his clones. The Jackal claims that this one is not a clone\nbut the real Gwen who was harvested from her remains and still has all her\nmemories, including those of her death. The Jackal offers Gwen the opportunity\nto be his business partner as he tries to change the world with his new\ntechnology. Gwen is hesitant about this new life at first but accepts it when\nthe Jackal shows that he has reanimated the clone of her father, who is much\nbetter than he was before he died.[28] When Spider-Man arrives at the\nincorporation and discovers the Jackal's experiments, he is surprised by\nGwen's presence and notes that unlike the other people the Jackal revived, who\nwere all clones, Gwen does not trigger his spider-sense, making him wonder if\nshe was the real one. He is attacked by the \"reborn\" [Doctor\nOctopus](/wiki/Doctor_Octopus \"Doctor Octopus\") before he can question the\nissue further.[28]\n\nAfter the Jackal breaks up the fight and shows Spider-Man around the New U,\nGeorge Stacy clone recognizes something off about Gwen's face and points his\ngun at her. It was revealed that the Gwen clone was actually her Earth-65\ncounterpart [Spider-Woman](/wiki/Spider-Woman_\\(Gwen_Stacy\\) \"Spider-Woman\n\\(Gwen Stacy\\)\") who assists Spider-Man in escaping. The real Gwen is\nkidnapped by [Kaine](/wiki/Kaine_Parker \"Kaine Parker\") and taken to [Parker\nIndustries](/wiki/Parker_Industries \"Parker Industries\") to be studied. Kaine\nreveals that he and Spider-Woman came to this Earth to assist Spider-Man\nbecause they saw that Spider-Man allying with the Jackal's offer on other\nworlds results in a global disaster.[29] Rhino and Electro are sent to\nretrieve Gwen after attacking the staff, but Gwen tells them to take Kaine\nwith him too because the condition could help with Jackal's experiments. Anna\nMaria Marconi also volunteers to come with because she has studied both Kaine\nand the drug.[30]\n\nWhen Spider-Man is taken to Haven, he catches up with Gwen in the household in\nthe facility, where she tries to convince him to support New U Technologies.\nPeter still has a hard time believing she is the real Gwen given his other\nexperiences with clones. Gwen tries justifying her existence by telling Peter\nher memories, including how she overheard the Green Goblin talking to Spider-\nMan before her death. Peter thinks she died hating him, but Gwen said that she\ndid not hate him, but rather died feeling betrayed. Peter again still has\ndoubts towards Gwen not being a clone. She tries kissing him, to no avail\nwhich only pushes him to put the mask back on. Gwen witnesses Jackal order the\nvillains clone to kill Spider-Man and wants to help.[31]\n\nDoctor Octopus pulls a switch that activates the Carrion Virus in all of the\nrevived, including Gwen and George, and causes them to start rapidly\ndecaying.[32] After Gwen's father deteriorates in her arms, she assists\nSpider-Man by helping him get to the lab. When the villains clone get to the\nlab doors, Gwen locks Spider-Man inside the lab and sacrifices herself towards\nthe villains to give him more time. Following the Carrion Virus being\nthwarted, Spider-Man and Anna check the building and see that Gwen has been\nreduced to dust.[33]\n\n## Other versions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gwen_Stacy&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Other versions\")]\n\n### \"Age of\nApocalypse\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gwen_Stacy&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: \"Age of Apocalypse\"\")]\n\nIn the two-issue mini-series _X-Universe_ , which details what happened to the\nrest of the Marvel Universe during the \"[Age of\nApocalypse](/wiki/Age_of_Apocalypse \"Age of Apocalypse\")\" storyline, the Green\nGoblin never killed Gwen Stacy. Instead she became the bodyguard of Donald\nBlake, who, in this reality, had never become [the Mighty\nThor](/wiki/Thor_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Thor \\(Marvel Comics\\)\"). Sometime later\nin the mainstream universe in X-Man #37, the Age of Apocalypse version of Gwen\nis pulled from her reality to the mainstream Earth's George Washington Bridge,\nmuch to Spider-Man's shock.[_[volume & issue\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]\n\n### Gwenpool[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gwen_Stacy&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Gwenpool\")]\n\nMain article: [Gwenpool](/wiki/Gwenpool \"Gwenpool\")\n\nDue to the popularity of [Spider-Gwen](/wiki/Spider-Gwen \"Spider-Gwen\"), in\nJune 2015 Marvel published variant covers for 20 of their current series,\nwhich saw Gwen Stacy re-imagined as other Marvel characters, such as [Doctor\nStrange](/wiki/Doctor_Strange \"Doctor Strange\"), [Groot](/wiki/Groot \"Groot\")\nand [Wolverine](/wiki/Wolverine_\\(character\\) \"Wolverine \\(character\\)\").[34]\nOne of those variants, for \"Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars #2\", featured an\namalgam of Gwen Stacy and [Deadpool](/wiki/Deadpool \"Deadpool\") dubbed\n\"Gwenpool\", which turned out to be especially popular with the fans.[35] As\nthe result, Marvel produced two stories featuring Gwenpool as a character, a\nbackup story in the series \"[Howard the Duck](/wiki/Howard_the_Duck \"Howard\nthe Duck\")\", and a one-shot \"Gwenpool Holiday Special #1\".[36] A retcon in the\nHoward the Duck #1 backup it was revealed her name is actually \"Gwen Poole\",\nnot Gwen Stacy, or even an alternate version of Gwen Stacy. Following the\npublication of the one-shot, an ongoing series titled _The Unbelievable\nGwenpool_ by the same creative team was announced, starting in April 2016.[37]\n\n### \"House of M\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gwen_Stacy&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: \"House of M\"\")]\n\nIn the reality seen in the \"[House of M](/wiki/House_of_M \"House of M\")\"\nstoryline, in which the [Scarlet Witch](/wiki/Scarlet_Witch \"Scarlet Witch\")\nalters reality to make mutants the ruling class over humans, Gwen was never\nkilled. Instead, she married Peter Parker, and the couple had a young son. She\nhad become a scientist, a savvy businesswoman, and a peace activist – and had\na decidedly hostile relationship with [chemical weapon](/wiki/Chemical_warfare\n\"Chemical warfare\") developer [Norman Osborn](/wiki/Green_Goblin \"Green\nGoblin\"). Mary Jane Watson, a popular actress in this reality, played Gwen\nStacy in the film adaptation of Spider-Man's life story. Gwen and her father\nread textual accounts of their deaths in the main universe, though they\nbelieve this simply to be the morbid imaginings of Peter Parker, who is\nsuffering from mental health issues.[38]\n\n### _Marvel\nAdventures_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gwen_Stacy&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Marvel Adventures\")]\n\nGwen Stacy first appeared in _[Marvel Adventures Spider-\nMan](/wiki/Marvel_Adventures_Spider-Man \"Marvel Adventures Spider-Man\")_ #53\nas a new student of Midtown High. She had transferred from her previous school\nafter the Torino Gang, a powerful New York mob, began harassing her in an\nattempt to keep her father, police captain George Stacy, from arresting\nmembers of their gang. However, the Torinos continued to harass Gwen at\nMidtown, prompting Spider-Man to help the police take down the gang.[39] Like\nher father, Gwen believes Spider-Man is a hero. She subsequently began\nparticipating in a \"Spider-Man Appreciation Society\" designed to foster better\npublic opinion of Spider-Man.[40] Gwen is also attracted to Spider-Man's alter\nego Peter Parker; although she openly flirted with him, Peter began dating a\ndifferent girl, [Sophia \"Chat\" Sanduval](/wiki/Sophia_%22Chat%22_Sanduval\n\"Sophia \"Chat\" Sanduval\"), which made Gwen very unhappy.[41] Later, Gwen was\nbrainwashed by [Emma Frost](/wiki/Emma_Frost \"Emma Frost\") into believing\n_she_ was dating Peter. Gwen's brainwashing wore off (or was undone by Emma),\nbut Gwen now believes her relationship with Peter ended when he chose Chat\nover her,[42] causing her to treat Chat very coldly. She has since warmed to\nChat, however.[43] Recently, Gwen began a close friendship with Carter Torino\nwho is the grandson of the head of the Torino Gang.[40] Their relationship is\ncomplicated by the fact Gwen's father is still trying to take down Carter's\ncriminal family.[44]\n\n### _Marvel Zombies\nReturn_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gwen_Stacy&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Marvel Zombies Return\")]\n\nIn the limited series, _[Marvel Zombies Return](/wiki/Marvel_Zombies_Return\n\"Marvel Zombies Return\")_ , Gwen of 'Earth Z' is still a college student out\nwith her friends Mary Jane and Harry Osborn.

Unfortunately, her father is killed by the Lizard before Peter can defeat the villain. George begs Peter to keep Gwen out of his dangerous life. Peter honors that vow without telling Gwen immediately; this affronts Gwen until she realizes what her father did, and subsequently forgives Peter. However, when Peter later wonders if he should keep that promise, she just smiles.\n  * Emma Stone reprises her role as Gwen Stacy in _[The Amazing Spider-Man 2](/wiki/The_Amazing_Spider-Man_2 \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\")_. Gwen continues to work at Oscorp, which is owned by [Harry Osborn](/wiki/Harry_Osborn \"Harry Osborn\"), Peter's best friend. By now, Peter and Gwen have decided to keep their relationship platonic, but Peter's romantic feelings for her are rekindled when she tells him that she is going to [England](/wiki/England \"England\") to study medicine at [Somerville College](/wiki/Somerville_College,_Oxford \"Somerville College, Oxford\"), [Oxford University](/wiki/Oxford_University \"Oxford University\"). When Oscorp employee Max Dillon suffers an industrial accident and becomes the villain [Electro](/wiki/Electro_\\(comics\\) \"Electro \\(comics\\)\"), Gwen starts asking questions; Donald Menken, a high ranking and mutinous Oscorp board member, decides that she is a threat, fires her and targets her for elimination. When Electro attacks the city's electricity supply, Gwen and Spider-Man work together to stop him. Just then, the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen and holds her hostage atop of the power plant's clock tower, intent on drawing Spider-Man out. The Green Goblin throws Gwen through the tower's glass rooftop, but Spider-Man saves her by shooting a web for her to grab onto. The web eventually breaks, however, and Gwen falls to the ground far below. Spider-Man catches her with another web an instant too late, as her head hits the concrete floor, killing her instantly. Gwen's death sends Peter into a deep depression, and he decides to give up being Spider-Man. Five months later, he watches a video of Gwen's graduation speech, in which she tells her class that hope is what makes life worth living, even in the darkest of times. Inspired, Peter decides to once again become Spider-Man.
