She completed her surgical residency at\n[George Washington University Medical\nSchool](/wiki/George_Washington_University_Medical_School \"George Washington\nUniversity Medical School\") and her fellowship at the Mayo Clinic in Florida.\nAs an attending physician, Teddy worked at Columbia, but after her best friend\nwas killed during the [collapse of the second\ntower](/wiki/September_11_attacks \"September 11 attacks\") on September 11,\n2001, she left and joined the army, meeting [trauma\nsurgeon](/wiki/Trauma_surgeon \"Trauma surgeon\") [Owen Hunt](/wiki/Owen_Hunt\n\"Owen Hunt\") ([Kevin McKidd](/wiki/Kevin_McKidd \"Kevin McKidd\")) during her\ntour in Baghdad.\n\nOwen brings Teddy to Seattle Grace Mercy West hospital to mentor his\ngirlfriend, [Cristina Yang](/wiki/Cristina_Yang \"Cristina Yang\") ([Sandra\nOh](/wiki/Sandra_Oh \"Sandra Oh\")). Teddy admits that she is in love with Owen,\nbut he tells her that he loves Cristina. When Teddy assigns Cristina a\ndifficult surgery for her first solo cardiothoracic case and refuses to\nassist, Owen questions Teddy's motives. Teddy decides to leave Seattle Grace;\nCristina pleads with her to stay, even offering to break up with Owen if Teddy\nwill continue to teach her. Although Teddy agrees to stay, Owen convinces\nCristina to stay with him, and Teddy briefly removes her from her service.\n\nTeddy develops a friendship with [pediatric surgeon](/wiki/Pediatric_surgeon\n\"Pediatric surgeon\") [Arizona Robbins](/wiki/Arizona_Robbins \"Arizona\nRobbins\") ([Jessica Capshaw](/wiki/Jessica_Capshaw \"Jessica Capshaw\")), who\nsets her up with [plastic surgeon](/wiki/Plastic_surgeon \"Plastic surgeon\")\n[Mark Sloan](/wiki/Mark_Sloan_\\(Grey%27s_Anatomy\\) \"Mark Sloan \\(Grey's\nAnatomy\\)\") ([Eric Dane](/wiki/Eric_Dane \"Eric Dane\")). They have a brief\nrelationship, which they both enjoy despite knowing that neither wants the\nother—Teddy still wants Owen, and Mark is in love with [Lexie\nGrey](/wiki/Lexie_Grey \"Lexie Grey\") ([Chyler Leigh](/wiki/Chyler_Leigh\n\"Chyler Leigh\")). The two separate amicably when Teddy walks in on Mark\nsleeping with resident Reed Adamson ([Nora Zehetner](/wiki/Nora_Zehetner \"Nora\nZehetner\")).\n\nTowards the end of [season six](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy_\\(season_6\\) \"Grey's\nAnatomy \\(season 6\\)\"), Teddy has to fight for her job as Chief of\nCardiothoracic Surgery. Cristina asks Owen to put in a good word for Teddy; he\ndoes the opposite by telling Chief of Surgery [Derek\nShepherd](/wiki/Derek_Shepherd \"Derek Shepherd\") ([Patrick\nDempsey](/wiki/Patrick_Dempsey \"Patrick Dempsey\")) that she would land on her\nfeet. Ultimately another candidate refuses to take the post and Teddy receives\na full-time contract. Teddy later learns of, and is hurt by Owen's betrayal.\n\nTeddy has a brief relationship with Dr. Andrew Perkins, whose service at the\nhospital is temporary. Before his departure, he suggests that Teddy has a\ntendency to fall for people who are either otherwise engaged or only in town\nfor a month. She later meets [Henry\nBurton](/wiki/List_of_Grey%27s_Anatomy_characters#Family_members \"List of\nGrey's Anatomy characters\"), a patient with the rare genetic condition [Von\nHippel-Lindau disease](/wiki/Von_Hippel-Lindau_disease \"Von Hippel-Lindau\ndisease\"), who can no longer afford to pay for his medical care. Teddy marries\nhim so that he can use her health insurance, and only comes to appreciate the\ngravity of this decision when Henry suffers a near fatal complication of his\nillness. Teddy discovers that he has listed her as his emergency contact and\nis forced to make a life-or-death decision regarding his care, not as his\ndoctor but as his wife. Though the newly-weds both maintain that theirs is a\nsimple [marriage of convenience](/wiki/Marriage_of_convenience \"Marriage of\nconvenience\"), and Teddy continues to date other men, Henry later confesses\nthat he has feelings for Teddy. She tells him she does not feel the same way.\n\nTeddy again removes Cristina from her service when she performs a surgery\ndespite Teddy's opposition. She tells Owen that Cristina's over-abundance of\nconfidence makes her dangerous, and that she will keep Cristina off her\nservice until she feels she is ready to return. When Andrew returns and asks\nTeddy to move to Germany with him, she accepts, and agrees to divorce Henry.\nHowever, in the [seventh season](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy_\\(season_7\\) \"Grey's\nAnatomy \\(season 7\\)\") finale, Teddy changes her mind and tells Henry that she\nis falling in love with him. The two begin their married life properly, but in\n[season eight](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy_\\(season_8\\) \"Grey's Anatomy \\(season\n8\\)\"), Henry dies, leaving Teddy distraught. She blames Owen because she\nwasn't told that Henry had died until after her surgery on another patient.\nFeeling that he put the hospital before her, she breaks off her friendship\nwith him, causing problems with them being able to work together that are\nlater made worse by Cristina's own relationship troubles with Owen (During\nthis time, Cristina tells Owen that he has to grant Teddy her anger, to which\nan enraged Owen lashes out the hypocrisy in the situation, given that when\nCristina discovered she was pregnant with Owen's child, she told him that\nkeeping the pregnancy was non negotiable and wanted to pursue an abortion,\ndespite Owen's desire to have a child, and his pleas to keep the pregnancy,\npoints out that Cristina never \"granted him any anger\" over what he thought\nwas her selfish decision). After a particularly bad case, Dr. Bailey sternly\ntells Teddy that what happened with Henry was not Owen's fault and that Teddy\nknows this and needs to get over it, which pushes Teddy to behave more civilly\ntowards Owen, but she finally lets go of her anger after she desperately begs\nOwen to convince Cristina (who by this point has broken up with him) to not\ntransfer away from Seattle and is left shocked and silent when Owen furiously\ntells her he will not do that because he and Teddy are only co-workers and, as\nshe made very clear, not friends and therefore she has no right to ask him for\nany help or favors. She and Owen eventually make up in the season finale. Owen\nfinds out she was offered a job at the [United States Army Medical\nCommand](/wiki/United_States_Army_Medical_Command \"United States Army Medical\nCommand\"), but turned it down because she wanted to be there for Owen, if he\nand Cristina were to separate. He ultimately fires her and she does take the\nmilitary job, and tells her that he'll be okay as they part having restored\ntheir friendship.Teddy and Owen make up and hug each other goodbye as he wants\nher to take the job offer, which would be good for her.\n\nTeddy was later mentioned in season thirteen episode \"True Colors.\" Army\nofficers knocked at Owen's door stating that his sister Megan is believed to\nhave been found alive ten years after her disappearance. At first, Owen is not\nsure what to believe, but his wife [Amelia Shepherd](/wiki/Amelia_Shepherd\n\"Amelia Shepherd\") mentioned to Owen that Teddy saw Megan and recognized her.\nThis seemed to be the first time Teddy was mentioned after her departure.\n\n## Development[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Teddy_Altman&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Kim_Raver.jpg/220px-\nKim_Raver.jpg)](/wiki/File:Kim_Raver.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kim_Raver.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRaver initially signed for a recurring role, but was promoted to a series\nregular.\n\n### Casting and\ncreation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Teddy_Altman&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Casting and creation\")]\n\nIn October 2009, it was reported that actress [Kim Raver](/wiki/Kim_Raver \"Kim\nRaver\") would play the character and have a recurring role on the show's sixth\nseason.[1] In January 2010, Raver was promoted to a series regular.[2]\n\nOn May 18, 2012, the day after the season eight finale, _Grey 's Anatomy_\ncreator, [Shonda Rhimes](/wiki/Shonda_Rhimes \"Shonda Rhimes\"), announced that\nit was Raver's decision to leave the show, \"I know this season’s finale had\nsome surprises for viewers and the exit of Kim Raver was one of the big ones.\nBut Kim’s series option was up and she was ready to give Teddy Altman a much-\nneeded vacation.
