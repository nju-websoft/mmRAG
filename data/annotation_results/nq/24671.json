Red-tailed hawks can acclimate to all the [biomes](/wiki/Biome\n\"Biome\") within their range. The 14 recognized subspecies vary in appearance\nand range. It is one of the largest members of the genus _[Buteo](/wiki/Buteo\n\"Buteo\")_ in North America, typically weighing from 690 to 1,600 g (1.5 to 3.5\nlb) and measuring 45–65 cm (18–26 in) in length, with a wingspan from 110–145\ncm (43–57 in). The red-tailed hawk displays [sexual\ndimorphism](/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism \"Sexual dimorphism\") in size, with females\naveraging about 25% heavier than males.[3] The bird is sometimes referred to\nas the **red-tail** for short, when the meaning is clear in context.\n\nThe subspecies **Harlan 's hawk** (_B. j. harlani_) is sometimes considered a\nseparate species (_B. harlani_).[4]\n\nThe red-tailed hawk occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes including\ndeserts, grasslands, [coniferous](/wiki/Coniferous \"Coniferous\") and\n[deciduous](/wiki/Deciduous \"Deciduous\") forests, agricultural fields and\nurban areas. It lives throughout the North American continent, except in areas\nof unbroken forest or the [high arctic](/wiki/Arctic \"Arctic\"). It is legally\nprotected in Canada, Mexico and the United States by the [Migratory Bird\nTreaty Act](/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act \"Migratory Bird Treaty Act\").\n\nBecause they are so common and easily trained as capable hunters, the majority\nof hawks captured for [falconry](/wiki/Falconry \"Falconry\") in the United\nStates are red-tails. Falconers are permitted to take only passage hawks\n(which have left the nest, are on their own, but are less than a year old) so\nas to not affect the breeding population. Adults, which may be breeding or\nrearing chicks, may not be taken for falconry purposes and it is illegal to do\nso. Passage red-tailed hawks are also preferred by falconers because these\nyounger birds have not yet developed the adult behaviors which would make them\nmore difficult to train.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Description\n  * 2 Taxonomy\n  * 3 Distribution and habitat\n  * 4 Behavior\n    * 4.1 Flight\n    * 4.2 Vocalization\n    * 4.3 Diet\n    * 4.4 Reproduction\n  * 5 Relationship with humans\n    * 5.1 Use in falconry\n    * 5.2 Feathers and Native American use\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n    * 7.1 Historical works\n    * 7.2 Live nest cameras\n\n## Description[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-tailed_hawk&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Description\")]\n\nAs is the case with many raptors, the red-tailed hawk displays [sexual\ndimorphism](/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism \"Sexual dimorphism\") in size, as females\nare up to 25% larger than males.[5] As is typical in large raptors, frequently\nreported mean body mass for Red-tailed Hawks are somewhat higher than\nexpansive research reveals.[6] Part of this weight is highly seasonally\nvariable and due to clinal variation, male red-tailed hawks may weigh from 690\nto 1,300 g (1.52 to 2.87 lb) and in females between 900 and 2,000 g (2.0 and\n4.4 lb). However, research from nine studies occurring at migration sites in\nthe [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") and two breeding\nstudies, one from the smallest race in [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico \"Puerto\nRico\"), the other from larger races in [Wisconsin](/wiki/Wisconsin\n\"Wisconsin\") show that males weigh a mean of 837 g (1.845 lb) and females\nweigh a mean of 1,040.7 g (2.294 lb), about 15% lighter than prior species-\nwide published weights.[6][7][8] The heaviest surveyed weights came from\nmigrants in [Cape May, New Jersey](/wiki/Cape_May,_New_Jersey \"Cape May, New\nJersey\"), where females weighed a mean of 1,278 g (2.818 lb), males a mean of\n990.8 g (2.184 lb).[7] The lightest were from the breeding population in\nforest openings of [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico \"Puerto Rico\"), where the\nfemales and males weighed an average of 1,023 g (2.255 lb) and 795 g (1.753\nlb), respectively, also the highest size sexual dimorphism in the species.\nSize variation in body mass reveals that the red-tailed hawks typically varies\nonly a modest amount, racial variation in average weights of [great horned\nowls](/wiki/Great_horned_owl \"Great horned owl\") show that mean body mass is\nnearly twice (the heaviest race is about 36% heavier than the lightest known\nrace on average) as variable as that of the hawk (where the heaviest race is\nonly just over 18% heavier on average than the lightest).[7][8][9] Males can\nreportedly measure 45 to 60 cm (18 to 24 in) in total length, females\nmeasuring 48 to 65 cm (19 to 26 in) long. The wingspan can range from 105 to\n141 cm (41 to 56 in) and, in the standard scientific method of measuring wing\nsize, the [wing chord](/wiki/Wing_chord_\\(biology\\) \"Wing chord \\(biology\\)\")\nis 325.1–444.5 mm (12.80–17.50 in) long. The tail measures 188 to 258.7 mm\n(7.40 to 10.19 in) in length.[10][11] The [exposed\nculmen](/wiki/Culmen_\\(bird\\) \"Culmen \\(bird\\)\") was reported to range from\n21.7 to 30.2 mm (0.85 to 1.19 in) and the [tarsus](/wiki/Tarsus_\\(skeleton\\)\n\"Tarsus \\(skeleton\\)\") averaged 74.7–95.8 mm (2.94–3.77 in).[6][7][12] The\nmiddle toe (excluding talon) can range from 38.3 to 53.8 mm (1.51 to 2.12 in),\nwith the hallux-claw (the talon of the rear toe, which has evolved to be the\nlargest in accipitrids) measuring from 24.1 to 33.6 mm (0.95 to 1.32 in) in\nlength.[6][7]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/RedTailDisplay.jpg/170px-\nRedTailDisplay.jpg)](/wiki/File:RedTailDisplay.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:RedTailDisplay.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCharacteristic red tail\n\nRed-tailed hawk [plumage](/wiki/Plumage \"Plumage\") can be variable, depending\non the [subspecies](/wiki/Subspecies \"Subspecies\") and the region. These color\nvariations are [morphs](/wiki/Polymorphism_\\(biology\\) \"Polymorphism\n\\(biology\\)\"), and are not related to [molting](/wiki/Molt \"Molt\"). The\nwestern North American population, _B. j. calurus_ , is the most variable\nsubspecies and has three color morphs: light, dark, and intermediate or rufus.\nThe dark and intermediate morphs constitute 10–20% of the population.[13]\n\nThough the markings and hue vary across the subspecies, the basic appearance\nof the red-tailed hawk is consistent. Overall, this species is blocky and\nbroad in shape, often appearing (and being) heavier than other\n_[Buteos](/wiki/Buteo \"Buteo\")_ of similar length.[10] A whitish underbelly\nwith a dark brown band across the belly, formed by horizontal streaks in\n[feather](/wiki/Feather \"Feather\") patterning, is present in most color\nvariations. Especially in younger birds, the underside may be otherwise\ncovered with dark brown spotting. The red tail, which gives this species its\nname, is uniformly brick-red above and light buff-orange below.[10][14] The\n[bill](/wiki/Beak \"Beak\") is short and dark, in the hooked shape\ncharacteristic of [raptors](/wiki/Bird_of_prey \"Bird of prey\"), and the head\ncan sometimes appear small in size against the thick body frame.[10] They have\na relatively short, broad tails and thick, chunky wings.[14] The\n[cere](/wiki/Cere \"Cere\"), the legs, and the feet of the red-tailed hawk are\nall yellow.[5]\n\nImmature birds can be readily identified at close range by their yellowish\n[irises](/wiki/Iris_\\(anatomy\\) \"Iris \\(anatomy\\)\"). As the bird attains full\nmaturity over the course of 3–4 years, the iris slowly darkens into a reddish-\nbrown hue. In both the light and dark morphs, the tail of the immature red-\ntailed hawk is patterned with numerous darker bars.[14]\n\n## Taxonomy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-tailed_hawk&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Taxonomy\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Red-\ntailed_hawk_in_flight.jpg/170px-Red-\ntailed_hawk_in_flight.jpg)](/wiki/File:Red-tailed_hawk_in_flight.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Red-tailed_hawk_in_flight.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIn flight showing the red tail\n\n![File:Hawk\nhovers.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Hawk_hovers.ogv/220px\n--Hawk_hovers.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Hawk_hovers.ogv \"Play\nmedia\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hawk_hovers.ogv \"Enlarge\")\n\nRed-tailed hawk hovers in the wind\n\nThe red-tailed hawk is a member of the [genus](/wiki/Genus \"Genus\")\n_[Buteo](/wiki/Buteo \"Buteo\")_ , a group of medium-sized raptors with robust\nbodies and broad wings. Members of this genus are known as _buzzards_ in\nEurope, but _hawks_ in North America.[15]\n\nThere are at least 14 recognized subspecies of _Buteo jamaicensis_ , which\nvary in range and in coloration:\n\n  * _B. j. jamaicensis_ , the nominate subspecies, occurs in the northern [West Indies](/wiki/West_Indies \"West Indies\"), including [Jamaica](/wiki/Jamaica \"Jamaica\"), [Hispaniola](/wiki/Hispaniola \"Hispaniola\"), [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico \"Puerto Rico\") and the [Lesser Antilles](/wiki/Lesser_Antilles \"Lesser Antilles\") but not the [Bahamas](/wiki/Bahamas \"Bahamas\") or [Cuba](/wiki/Cuba \"Cuba\"). [El Yunque National Forest](/wiki/El_Yunque_National_Forest \"El Yunque National Forest\"), [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico \"Puerto Rico\") holds the highest known density of red-tailed hawks anywhere.[16] The bird is referred to as \"Guaraguao\" in the island.[17][18]\n  * _B. j. alascensis_ breeds (probably resident) from southeastern coastal [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska \"Alaska\") to the [Queen Charlotte Islands](/wiki/Queen_Charlotte_Islands \"Queen Charlotte Islands\") and [Vancouver Island](/wiki/Vancouver_Island \"Vancouver Island\") in British Columbia.[19]\n  * _B. j. borealis_ group[20] (eastern red-tailed hawk)[20] breeds from southeast Canada and [Maine](/wiki/Maine \"Maine\") south through eastern Texas and east to northern Florida. It winters from southern Ontario east to southern Maine and south to the Gulf coast and Florida.[19]\n  * _B. j. calurus_ (western red-tailed hawk)[20] breeds from central interior [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska \"Alaska\"), through western Canada south to Baja California. It winters from southwestern [British Columbia](/wiki/British_Columbia \"British Columbia\") southwest to [Guatemala](/wiki/Guatemala \"Guatemala\") and northern [Nicaragua](/wiki/Nicaragua \"Nicaragua\").[19] Paler individuals of northern Mexico may lack the dark wing marking.[21]\n  * _B. j. costaricensis_ is resident from [Nicaragua](/wiki/Nicaragua \"Nicaragua\") to [Panama](/wiki/Panama \"Panama\"). This subspecies is dark brown above with cinnamon flanks, wing linings and sides, and some birds have rufous underparts. The chest is much less heavily streaked than in northern migrants (_B. j. calurus_) to Central America.\n  * _B. j. fuertesi_ (southwestern red-tailed hawk)[20] breeds from northern [Chihuahua](/wiki/Chihuahua_\\(state\\) \"Chihuahua \\(state\\)\") to southern Texas. It winters in [Arizona](/wiki/Arizona \"Arizona\"), [New Mexico](/wiki/New_Mexico \"New Mexico\"), and southern [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\").[19] The belly is unstreaked or only lightly streaked, and the tail is pale.\n  * _B. j. fumosus_ , [Islas Marías](/wiki/Islas_Mar%C3%ADas \"Islas Marías\"), Mexico\n  * _B. j. hadropus_ , Mexican Highlands\n  * _B. j. harlani_ (Harlan's red-tailed hawk,[20] sometimes classified as its own species, _B. harlani_ , Harlan's hawk[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]) is markedly different from all other red-tails. In both color morphs, the plumage is blackish and white, lacking warm tones (save the tail). The tail may be reddish, dusky, whitish, or gray and can be longitudinally streaked, mottled, or barred. Shorter primaries result in wingtips that don't reach the tail in perched birds. It breeds in Alaska and northwestern Canada and winters from [Nebraska](/wiki/Nebraska \"Nebraska\") and [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\") to Texas and northern [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\").[19] This population may well be a separate species.\n  * _B. j. kemsiesi_ is a dark subspecies resident from [Chiapas](/wiki/Chiapas \"Chiapas\") to [Nicaragua](/wiki/Nicaragua \"Nicaragua\"). The dark wing marking may not be distinct in paler birds.[21]\n  * _B. j. kriderii_ (Krider's red-tailed hawk)[20] is paler than other red-tails, especially on the head; the tail may be pinkish or white. In the breeding season, it occurs from southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, southern Manitoba, and extreme western Ontario south to south-central Montana, Wyoming, western Nebraska, and western Minnesota. In winter, it occurs from South Dakota and southern Minnesota south to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana.[19]\n  * _B. j. socorroensis_ , [Socorro Island](/wiki/Socorro_Island \"Socorro Island\"), Mexico\n  * _B. j. solitudinus_ , Bahamas and Cuba\n  * _B. j. umbrinus_ occurs year-round in peninsular Florida north to [Tampa Bay](/wiki/Tampa_Bay \"Tampa Bay\") and the Kissimmee Prairie.[19] It is similar in appearance to _calurus_\n\nThe four island forms, _jamaicensis_ , _solitudinus_ , _socorroensis_ , and\n_fumosus_ , do not overlap in range with any other subspecies.\n\n## Distribution and habitat[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-\ntailed_hawk&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Distribution and habitat\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Buteo_jamaicensis_-\nPillar_Point_Harbor%2C_California%2C_USA-8.jpg/220px-Buteo_jamaicensis_-\nPillar_Point_Harbor%2C_California%2C_USA-8.jpg)](/wiki/File:Buteo_jamaicensis_-\nPillar_Point_Harbor,_California,_USA-8.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Buteo_jamaicensis_-Pillar_Point_Harbor,_California,_USA-8.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nImmature in California\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Red_Tailed_Hawk_Stare.jpg/220px-\nRed_Tailed_Hawk_Stare.jpg)](/wiki/File:Red_Tailed_Hawk_Stare.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Red_Tailed_Hawk_Stare.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA juvenile red-tailed hawk\n\nThe red-tailed hawk is one of the most widely scattered hawks in the Americas.\nIt breeds from central [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska \"Alaska\"), the\n[Yukon](/wiki/Yukon \"Yukon\"), and the [Northwest\nTerritories](/wiki/Northwest_Territories \"Northwest Territories\") east to\nsouthern [Quebec](/wiki/Quebec \"Quebec\") and the [Maritime\nProvinces](/wiki/Maritime_Provinces \"Maritime Provinces\") of Canada, and south\nto Florida, the [West Indies](/wiki/West_Indies \"West Indies\"), and Central\nAmerica. The winter range stretches from southern Canada south throughout the\nremainder of the breeding range.[19]\n\nIts preferred habitat is mixed forest and field, with high bluffs or trees\nthat may be used as perch sites. It occupies a wide range of\n[habitats](/wiki/Habitat_\\(ecology\\) \"Habitat \\(ecology\\)\") and altitudes,\nincluding deserts, grasslands, coastal regions, mountains, foothills,\n[coniferous](/wiki/Coniferous \"Coniferous\") and [deciduous](/wiki/Deciduous\n\"Deciduous\") woodlands, [tropical rainforests](/wiki/Tropical_rainforest\n\"Tropical rainforest\"), [agricultural fields](/wiki/Field_\\(agriculture\\)\n\"Field \\(agriculture\\)\") and urban areas.[1] It is second only to the\n[peregrine falcon](/wiki/Peregrine_falcon \"Peregrine falcon\") in the use of\ndiverse habitats in North America.[22] It lives throughout the North American\ncontinent, except in areas of unbroken forest or the high Arctic.[13]\n\nAdult hawks have few natural predators, although their eggs and chicks are\npreyed on by a variety of organisms. The red-tailed hawk is widespread in\nNorth America,[22] partially due to historic settlement patterns, which have\nbenefited it. The clearing of forests in the Northeast created hunting areas,\nwhile the preservation of [woodlots](/wiki/Woodlot \"Woodlot\") left the species\nwith viable nest sites. The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains\nduring the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated\nthe western range expansion of the red-tailed hawk[23] as well as range\nexpansions of many other species of birds.[24][25][26] The construction of\nhighways with [utility poles](/wiki/Utility_pole \"Utility pole\") alongside\ntreeless medians provided perfect habitat for perch-hunting. Unlike some other\nraptors, the red-tailed hawk are seemingly unfazed by considerable human\nactivity and can nest and live in close proximity to large numbers of\nhumans.[10] Thus, the species can also be found in cities, where common prey\nsuch as [rock pigeons](/wiki/Rock_pigeon \"Rock pigeon\") and [brown\nrats](/wiki/Brown_rat \"Brown rat\") may support their populations.[27] One\nfamous urban red-tailed hawk, known as \"[Pale Male](/wiki/Pale_Male \"Pale\nMale\")\", became the subject of a non-fiction book, _Red-Tails in Love: A\nWildlife Drama in Central Park_ , and is the first known red-tail in decades\nto successfully nest and raise young in the crowded [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") borough of\n[Manhattan](/wiki/Manhattan \"Manhattan\").[28][29][30]\n\nHawks in urban areas are threatened by the use of rat traps and poisoned bait\nto kill rodents. This generally consists of [warfarin](/wiki/Warfarin\n\"Warfarin\") cookies which induce internal bleeding in rats and mice, and a\nhawk that ingests rodents who have consumed rat poison can itself be\naffected.[31]\n\n## Behavior[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-tailed_hawk&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Behavior\")]\n\n### Flight[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-tailed_hawk&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Flight\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Red-\ntailed_Hawk_%28Audubon%29.jpg/170px-Red-\ntailed_Hawk_%28Audubon%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Red-tailed_Hawk_\\(Audubon\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Red-tailed_Hawk_\\(Audubon\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRed-tailed hawks engaging in an inflight battle over prey. Painted by [John\nJames Audubon](/wiki/John_James_Audubon \"John James Audubon\").\n\nIn flight, this hawk soars with wings often in a slight\n[dihedral](/wiki/Dihedral_angle \"Dihedral angle\"), flapping as little as\npossible to conserve energy. Active flight is slow and deliberate, with deep\nwing beats. In wind, it occasionally hovers on beating wings and remains\nstationary above the ground.[13] When soaring or flapping its wings, it\ntypically travels from 32 to 64 km/h (40 mph), but when diving may exceed 190\nkm/h (120 mph).[32]\n\n### Vocalization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-\ntailed_hawk&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Vocalization\")]\n\nThe cry of the red-tailed hawk is a two to three second hoarse, rasping\nscream, described as _kree-eee-ar_ ,[27] that begins at a high pitch and slurs\ndownward.[32] This cry is often described as sounding similar to a steam\nwhistle.[5] The red-tailed hawk frequently vocalizes while hunting or soaring,\nbut vocalizes loudest in annoyance or anger, in response to a predator or a\nrival hawk's intrusion into its territory.[27] At close range, it makes a\ncroaking \"guh-runk\".[33] Young hawks may utter a wailing _klee-uk_ food cry\nwhen parents leave the nest.[34] The fierce, screaming cry of the red-tailed\nhawk is frequently used as a generic raptor sound effect in television shows\nand other media, even if the bird featured is not a red-tailed hawk.[35][36]\n\n### Diet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-tailed_hawk&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Diet\")]\n\nThe red-tailed hawk is [carnivorous](/wiki/Carnivorous \"Carnivorous\"), and an\nopportunistic feeder. Their most common prey are small mammals such as rodents\nand lagomorphs, but they will also consume birds, fish, reptiles, and\namphibians. Prey varies with regional and seasonal availability, but usually\ncenters on [rodents](/wiki/Rodent \"Rodent\"), comprising up to 85% of a hawk's\ndiet.[5] Most commonly reported prey types include [mice](/wiki/Mouse\n\"Mouse\"), including both native _[Peromyscus](/wiki/Peromyscus \"Peromyscus\")_\nspecies and [house mice](/wiki/House_mouse \"House mouse\");\n[gophers](/wiki/Pocket_gopher \"Pocket gopher\"), [voles](/wiki/Vole \"Vole\"),\n[chipmunks](/wiki/Chipmunk \"Chipmunk\"), [ground\nsquirrels](/wiki/Ground_squirrel \"Ground squirrel\") and [tree\nsquirrels](/wiki/Tree_squirrel \"Tree squirrel\").[37][38] Additional prey\n(listed by descending likelihood of predation) include\n[lagomorphs](/wiki/Lagomorph \"Lagomorph\"), [shrews](/wiki/Shrew \"Shrew\"),\n[bats](/wiki/Bat \"Bat\"),[39] [pigeons](/wiki/Pigeon \"Pigeon\"),\n[quail](/wiki/Quail \"Quail\"), [corvids](/wiki/Corvid \"Corvid\"),\n[waterfowl](/wiki/Waterfowl \"Waterfowl\"), other [raptors](/wiki/Birds_of_prey\n\"Birds of prey\"), [reptiles](/wiki/Reptile \"Reptile\"), [fish](/wiki/Fish\n\"Fish\"), [crustaceans](/wiki/Crustacean \"Crustacean\"), [insects](/wiki/Insect\n\"Insect\") and [earthworms](/wiki/Earthworm \"Earthworm\").[10] Where found in\n[Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean \"Caribbean\") islands, red-tailed hawks prey mostly\non [reptiles](/wiki/Reptile \"Reptile\") such as [snakes](/wiki/Snake \"Snake\")\nand [lizards](/wiki/Lizard \"Lizard\"), since these are perhaps the most\npredominant native land animals of that region.[10] Prey specimens can range\nto as small a size as [beetles](/wiki/Beetle \"Beetle\") and worms. However,\nthey can also prey on [marmots](/wiki/Marmot \"Marmot\"), [white-tailed\njackrabbits](/wiki/White-tailed_jackrabbit \"White-tailed jackrabbit\"), or\nfemale [wild turkey](/wiki/Wild_turkey \"Wild turkey\"), all of which are at\nleast easily double the weight of most red-tails.[10] Hawks will eat\n[carrion](/wiki/Carrion \"Carrion\") if need be, although it is not a preferred\nfood source. During winter in captivity, an average red-tail will eat about\n135 g (4.8 oz) daily.[34]\n\n![File:Red-tailed Hawk Eating a Rodent 1080p\n60fps.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Red-\ntailed_Hawk_Eating_a_Rodent_1080p_60fps.ogv/220px-seek%3D12-Red-\ntailed_Hawk_Eating_a_Rodent_1080p_60fps.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Red-\ntailed_Hawk_Eating_a_Rodent_1080p_60fps.ogv \"Play media\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:Red-tailed_Hawk_Eating_a_Rodent_1080p_60fps.ogv \"Enlarge\")\n\nRed-tailed hawk eating a rodent\n\nThe red-tailed hawk commonly employs one of two hunting techniques. Often,\nthey scan for prey activity from an elevated perch site, swooping down from\nthe perch to seize the prey. They also watch for prey while flying, either\ncapturing a bird in flight or pursuing prey on the ground until they can pin\nthem down in their talons.[10] Red-tailed hawks, like some other raptors, have\nbeen observed to hunt in pairs. This may consist of stalking opposites sides\nof a tree, in order to surround a tree squirrel and almost inevitably drive\nthe rodent to be captured by one after being flushed by the other hawk.[40]\nThey are opportunistically attracted to conspicuous meals, such as displaying\nmale [red-winged blackbirds](/wiki/Red-winged_blackbird \"Red-winged\nblackbird\").[5]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Redtailedhawkeatingsquirrel07.jpg/220px-\nRedtailedhawkeatingsquirrel07.jpg)](/wiki/File:Redtailedhawkeatingsquirrel07.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Redtailedhawkeatingsquirrel07.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJuvenile eating a squirrel\n\nThe [great horned owl](/wiki/Great_horned_owl \"Great horned owl\") occupies a\nsimilar [ecological niche](/wiki/Ecological_niche \"Ecological niche\")\nnocturnally to the red-tail, taking similar prey. Competition may occur\nbetween the hawk and [owl](/wiki/Owl \"Owl\") species during twilight, although\nthe differing nesting season and activity times usually results in a lack of\ndirect competition. Although the red-tail's prey is on average larger (due in\npart to the scarcity of diurnal [squirrels](/wiki/Squirrel \"Squirrel\") in the\nowl's diet),[38] the owl is an occasional predator of red-tailed hawks\nthemselves, of any age, while the hawks are not known to predate adult great\nhorned owls.[37] Other competitors include other large _[Buteo](/wiki/Buteo\n\"Buteo\")_ species such as [Swainson's hawks](/wiki/Swainson%27s_hawk\n\"Swainson's hawk\") and [rough-legged hawks](/wiki/Rough-legged_hawk \"Rough-\nlegged hawk\"), as well as the [northern goshawk](/wiki/Northern_goshawk\n\"Northern goshawk\"), since prey and foraging methods of these species\noccasionally overlap.[41][42] Hawks have been observed following [American\nbadgers](/wiki/American_badger \"American badger\") to capture prey they flush\nand the two are considered potential competitors.[43] Competition over\ncarcasses may occur with [American crows](/wiki/American_crow \"American\ncrow\"), and several crows working together can displace a hawk.[44] Larger\nraptors, such as [eagles](/wiki/Eagle \"Eagle\") and [ferruginous\nhawks](/wiki/Ferruginous_hawk \"Ferruginous hawk\"), may steal hawk kills.[5]\n\n### Reproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-\ntailed_hawk&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Reproduction\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Courting_redtails.JPG/170px-\nCourting_redtails.JPG)](/wiki/File:Courting_redtails.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Courting_redtails.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nTerritorial adult chasing away an immature red-tailed hawk\n\nThe red-tailed hawk reaches [sexual maturity](/wiki/Sexual_maturity \"Sexual\nmaturity\") at two years of age. It is [monogamous](/wiki/Monogamous\n\"Monogamous\"), mating with the same individual for many years. In general, the\nred-tailed hawk will only take a new mate when its original mate dies.[45] The\nsame nesting territory may be defended by the pair for years. During\ncourtship, the male and female fly in wide circles while uttering shrill\ncries. The male performs aerial displays, diving steeply, and then climbing\nagain. After repeating this display several times, he sometimes grasps her\n[talons](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/talon\n\"wikt:Special:Search/talon\") briefly with his own. Courtship flights can last\n10 minutes or more. Copulation often follows courtship flight sequences,\nalthough copulation frequently occurs in the absence of courtship flights.\n\nIn copulation, the female, when perched, tilts forward, allowing the male to\nland with his feet lodged on her horizontal back. The female twists and moves\nher tail feathers to one side, while the mounted male twists his cloacal\nopening around the female's cloaca. Copulation lasts 5 to 10 seconds and\nduring pre-nesting courtship in late winter or early spring can occur numerous\ntimes each day.[46]\n\nIn the same period, the pair constructs a stick [nest](/wiki/Bird_nest \"Bird\nnest\") in a large tree 4 to 21 m (13 to 69 ft) off the ground or on a cliff\nledge 35 m (115 ft) or higher above the ground, or may nest on man-made\nstructures. The nest is generally 71 to 97 cm (28 to 38 in) in diameter and\ncan be up to 90 cm (3.0 ft) tall. The nest is constructed of twigs, and lined\nwith [bark](/wiki/Bark \"Bark\"), pine needles, [corn cobs](/wiki/Corn_cob \"Corn\ncob\"), husks, stalks, [aspen](/wiki/Aspen \"Aspen\") catkins, or other plant\nlining matter.\n\nGreat horned owls compete with the red-tailed hawk for nest sites. Each\nspecies has been known to kill the young and destroy the eggs of the other,\nbut in general, both species nest in adjacent or confluent territories without\nconflict. Great horned owls are incapable of constructing nests and typically\nexpropriate existing red-tail nests. Great horned owls begin nesting behaviors\nmuch earlier than red-tails, often as early as December. Red-tails are\ntherefore adapted to constructing new nests when a previous year's nest has\nbeen overtaken by owls or otherwise lost. New nests are typically within a\nkilometer or less of the previous nest. Often, a new nest is only a few\nhundred meters or less from a previous one. Being a large predator, most\npredation of these hawks occurs with eggs and nestlings, which are taken by\n[owls](/wiki/Owl \"Owl\"), [corvids](/wiki/Corvid \"Corvid\") and\n[raccoons](/wiki/Raccoon \"Raccoon\").[47]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/RT_hawks.jpg/220px-\nRT_hawks.jpg)](/wiki/File:RT_hawks.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:RT_hawks.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nParent in nest with chicks\n\nA clutch of one to three [eggs](/wiki/Egg \"Egg\") is laid in March or April,\ndepending upon latitude. Clutch size depends almost exclusively on the\navailability of prey for the adults. Eggs are laid approximately every other\nday. The eggs are usually about 60 mm × 47 mm (2.4 in × 1.9 in). They are\n[incubated](/wiki/Avian_incubation \"Avian incubation\") primarily by female,\nwith the male substituting when the female leaves to hunt or merely stretch\nher wings. The male brings most food to the female while she incubates. After\n28 to 35 days, the eggs hatch over 2 to 4 days; the nestlings are\n[altricial](/wiki/Altricial \"Altricial\") at hatching. The female broods them\nwhile the male provides most of the food to the female and the young, which\nare known as eyasses (pronounced \"EYE-ess-ez\"). The female feeds the eyasses\nafter tearing the food into small pieces. After 42 to 46 days, the eyasses\nbegin to leave the nest. The [fledging](/wiki/Fledge \"Fledge\") period follows,\nwith short flights engaged in, after another 3 weeks. About 6 to 7 weeks after\nfledging, the young begin to capture their own prey. Shortly thereafter, when\nthe young are around 4 months of age, they become independent of their\nparents. However, the hawks do not generally reach breeding maturity until\nthey are around 3 years of age. In the wild, red-tailed hawks have lived for\nat least 25 years, for example, [Pale Male](/wiki/Pale_Male \"Pale Male\") was\nborn in 1990, and in Spring 2014 is still raising eyasses. The oldest captive\nhawk of this species was at least 29 and a half years of age.[5]\n\n## Relationship with humans[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-\ntailed_hawk&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Relationship with humans\")]\n\nSee also § Distribution and habitat, for habitat relationships to human\nsettlement patterns.\n\n### Use in falconry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-\ntailed_hawk&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Use in falconry\")]\n\nThe red-tailed hawk is a popular bird in [falconry](/wiki/Falconry\n\"Falconry\"), particularly in the United States where the sport of falconry is\ntightly regulated and where red-tailed hawks are both widely available and\nallowed to novice falconers. Red-tailed hawks are highly tameable and\ntrainable, with a more social disposition than all other falcons or hawks\nother than the [Harris's hawk](/wiki/Harris%27s_hawk \"Harris's hawk\").[48]\nThey are also long lived and highly disease resistant, allowing a falconer to\nmaintain a red-tailed hawk as a hunting companion for many years. There are\nfewer than 5,000 falconers in the United States, so despite their popularity\nany effect on the red-tailed hawk population, estimated to be about one\nmillion in the United States, is negligible.[49]\n\nNot being as swift as [falcons](/wiki/Falcon \"Falcon\") or\n[accipiters](/wiki/Accipiter \"Accipiter\"), red-tailed hawks are not the most\neffective of bird hawks and are usually used against ground game such as\nrabbits and squirrels. However, some individuals may learn to ambush birds on\nthe ground with a swift surprise approach and capture them before they can\naccelerate to full speed and escape. Some have even learned to use a falcon-\nlike diving stoop to capture challenging game such as pheasants. In the course\nof a typical hunt, a falconer using a red-tailed hawk most commonly releases\nthe hawk and allows it to perch in a tree or other high vantage point. The\nfalconer, who may be aided by a dog, then attempts to\n[flush](/wiki/Hunting#Methods \"Hunting\") prey by stirring up ground cover. A\nwell-trained red-tailed hawk will follow the falconer and dog, realizing that\ntheir activities produce opportunities to catch game. Once a raptor catches\ngame, it does not bring it back to the falconer. Instead, the falconer must\nlocate the bird and its captured prey, \"make in\" (carefully approach) and\ntrade the bird its kill in exchange for a piece of offered meat.[50]\n\n### Feathers and Native American use[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-\ntailed_hawk&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Feathers and Native American\nuse\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Red-\nTailed_Hawk_%2829478965112%29.jpg/220px-Red-\nTailed_Hawk_%2829478965112%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Red-\nTailed_Hawk_\\(29478965112\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Red-Tailed_Hawk_\\(29478965112\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRed-tailed hawk in [Oregon](/wiki/Oregon \"Oregon\")\n\nThe [feathers](/wiki/Feather \"Feather\") and other parts of the red-tailed hawk\nare considered [sacred](/wiki/Sacred \"Sacred\") to many American [indigenous\npeople](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples \"Indigenous peoples\") and, like the feathers\nof the [bald eagle](/wiki/Bald_eagle \"Bald eagle\") and [golden\neagle](/wiki/Golden_eagle \"Golden eagle\"), are sometimes used in religious\nceremonies and found adorning the [regalia](/wiki/Regalia \"Regalia\") of many\n[Native Americans in the United\nStates](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native Americans in the\nUnited States\"); these parts, most especially their distinctive tail feathers,\nare a popular item in the Native American community.[51] As with the other two\nspecies, the feathers and parts of the red-tailed hawk are regulated by the\n[eagle feather law](/wiki/Eagle_feather_law \"Eagle feather law\"),[52] which\ngoverns the possession of feathers and parts of migratory birds.[53]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red-tailed_hawk&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [BirdLife International](/wiki/BirdLife_International \"BirdLife International\") (2012).
