The song was rewritten many times\nbefore being finalized, months later. \"We wrote, most every week, in Mike’s\nbasement,\" Shamblin told Peter Cooper in an interview with the [Nashville\nTennessean](/wiki/Nashville_Tennessean \"Nashville Tennessean\"). \"And we’d\nworked on this song for more than six months. One day, he said, ‘Come up to\nthe living room,’ where his piano was. He sat down and started playing this\nmelody, and it was one of the most moving pieces of music I’d heard. I mean,\nit hit me in a hard way... Instantly, I knew it was the best thing I’d ever\nbeen a part of.\"[4] Reid and Shamblin were both [country\nmusic](/wiki/Country_music \"Country music\") songwriters, who according to some\naccounts originally wrote the song as a fast,\n[bluegrass](/wiki/Bluegrass_music \"Bluegrass music\") number. Upon slowing down\nthe tempo considerably, they realized the song gained considerable power and\nthought about giving the song to one of three artists: [Bonnie\nRaitt](/wiki/Bonnie_Raitt \"Bonnie Raitt\"), [Bette Midler](/wiki/Bette_Midler\n\"Bette Midler\") or [Linda Ronstadt](/wiki/Linda_Ronstadt \"Linda Ronstadt\").\nEventually, the song made its way to [Bonnie Raitt](/wiki/Bonnie_Raitt \"Bonnie\nRaitt\"), who recorded the track for her eleventh studio album, \"[Luck of the\nDraw](/wiki/Luck_of_the_Draw_\\(album\\) \"Luck of the Draw \\(album\\)\")\" (1991).\nRaitt co-produced the song with [Don Was](/wiki/Don_Was \"Don Was\"), while\n[Bruce Hornsby](/wiki/Bruce_Hornsby \"Bruce Hornsby\") provided a piano\naccompaniment.[5]\n\n## Composition and\ninspiration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Make_You_Love_Me&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Composition and inspiration\")]\n\n\"I Can't Make You Love Me\" was composed in the [key](/wiki/Key_\\(music\\) \"Key\n\\(music\\)\") of [Bb major](/wiki/Bb_major \"Bb major\"), with a moderate slow\ntempo of 72 [beats per minute](/wiki/Beats_per_minute \"Beats per minute\").\nRaitt's vocal range on the song spans from the low-note of F3 to the high-note\nof Bb4.[6] The idea for the song came to Reid while reading an article about a\nman arrested for getting drunk and shooting at his girlfriend's car. The judge\nasked him if he had learned anything, to which he replied, \"I learned, Your\nHonor, that you can't make a woman love you if she don't.\"[7] Raitt recorded\nthe vocal in just one take in the studio, later saying that it was so sad a\nsong that she could not recapture the emotion: \"We'd try to do it again and I\njust said, 'You know, this ain't going to happen.'\"[8]\n\nA pensive [ballad](/wiki/Ballad \"Ballad\"), \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" was\nrecorded against a quiet [electric piano](/wiki/Electric_piano \"Electric\npiano\")-based arrangement, with prominent [piano](/wiki/Piano \"Piano\") fills\nand interpolations supplied by [Bruce Hornsby](/wiki/Bruce_Hornsby \"Bruce\nHornsby\"). The singer depicts a now one-sided romantic relationship about to\nend in soft but brutally honest terms: \"Turn down the lights, turn down the\nbed/Turn down these voices inside my head/Lay down with me, tell me no\nlies/Just hold me close, don't patronize... don't patronize me/'Cause I can't\nmake you love me if you don't/You can't make your heart feel something that it\nwon't,\" she sings.[9]\n\n## Critical reception and\naccolades[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Make_You_Love_Me&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Critical reception and accolades\")]\n\n\"I Can't Make You Love Me\" received acclaim from [music\ncritics](/wiki/Music_critics \"Music critics\"). [Stephen Thomas\nErlewine](/wiki/Stephen_Thomas_Erlewine \"Stephen Thomas Erlewine\") of\n[AllMusic](/wiki/AllMusic \"AllMusic\") praised the track, calling it a \"strong\nsong\" and picking it as one of the album's best tracks.[10] Steve Hochman of\n_[Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles Times\")_ hailed the\nsong as one of Raitt's most elegant tracks.[11] Elysa Gardner wrote for\n_[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ that \"Raitt's\ngorgeously understated rendering of 'I Can't Make You Love Me,' in which\nsentiments such as 'I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power/But you\nwon't' are delivered with a quiet resignation that's worth a hundred glissandi\nin emotional weight.\"[12]\n\n\"I Can't Make You Love Me\" entered many lists of the greatest songs of all\ntime. In 2000, [Mojo magazine](/wiki/Mojo_magazine \"Mojo magazine\") placed it\nat number 8 on its \"100 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list.[5] The song is also\nranked #339 on the [Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")\nmagazine's list of [The 500 Greatest Songs of All\nTime](/wiki/The_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All\nTime\").[2] The website \"Ultimate Classic Rock\" placed the song at number 24 on\ntheir \"25 Saddest Songs Ever\", praising Bonnie Raitt vocals, writing that \"she\nsings in one of her most impassioned vocals ever. There's real ache in every\nword that drips from her pained lips.\"[13]\n\nThe song's popularity helped solidify her remarkable late-in-career commercial\nsuccess that had begun two years before. In the time since, \"I Can't Make You\nLove Me\" has gone on to become a pop standard and a mainstay of adult\ncontemporary radio formats. For Raitt, the song was notoriously difficult to\nsing, due to its required vocal range, difficult phrasing and breathing, and\nthe emotional content involved. At the televised [Grammy Awards of\n1992](/wiki/Grammy_Awards_of_1992 \"Grammy Awards of 1992\") Raitt performed it\nin an even more austere setting than on record, with just her and Hornsby\nhighlighted. As she negotiated the final vocal line, she let out a big audible\nand visible sigh of relief that she had successfully gotten through it. Her\nlive performance of the song was released on the 1994 album _Grammy 's\nGreatest Moments Volume III_.[14] Raitt has continued to sing the song in all\nher concert tours:\n\n“ | I mean, 'I Can't Make You Love Me' is no picnic. I love that song, so does the audience. So it's almost a sacred moment when you share that, that depth of pain with your audience. Because they get really quiet, and I have to summon ... some other place in order to honor that space. | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \n## Chart\nperformance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Make_You_Love_Me&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Chart performance\")]\n\nThe song was a big hit for Raitt, reaching number 18 on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") and number 6 on the\n[Billboard Adult Contemporary](/wiki/Adult_Contemporary_\\(chart\\) \"Adult\nContemporary \\(chart\\)\") chart.[15] The song placed at number 100 on the\n[_Billboard_ Year-End](/wiki/Billboard_Year-End \"Billboard Year-End\") chart of\n1992.[16] In [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\"), the song was\nRaitt's highest charting-single, reaching number 22,[17] while in\n[Netherlands](/wiki/Netherlands \"Netherlands\"), the song charted moderately at\nnumber 43.[18]\n\n##\nCharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Make_You_Love_Me&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Charts\")]\n\n### Weekly\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Make_You_Love_Me&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Weekly charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1991-92) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nNew Zealand ([Recorded Music NZ](/wiki/Recorded_Music_NZ \"Recorded Music NZ\"))[17] | 22  \nNetherlands ([Single Top 100](/wiki/Single_Top_100 \"Single Top 100\"))[18] | 43  \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[19] | 18  \nUS [Adult Contemporary](/wiki/Adult_Contemporary_\\(chart\\) \"Adult Contemporary \\(chart\\)\") (_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_)[20] | 6  \n  \n### Year-end\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Make_You_Love_Me&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Year-end charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1992) | Rank  \n---|---  \nUS [Billboard Year-End Chart](/wiki/Billboard_Year-End \"Billboard Year-End\")[21] | 100  \n  \n## Bruce Hornsby performance\nuse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Make_You_Love_Me&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Bruce Hornsby performance use\")]\n\nAlthough Bruce Hornsby had no hand in writing the song, his piano part on it\nbecame associated with him.
