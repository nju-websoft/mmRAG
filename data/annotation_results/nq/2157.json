The show was created as a night-\ntime parody of daytime [soap operas](/wiki/Soap_opera \"Soap opera\"), presented\nas a weekly half-hour [prime time](/wiki/Prime_time \"Prime time\") comedy.\nSimilar to a soap opera, the show's story was presented in a\n[serial](/wiki/Serial_\\(radio_and_television\\) \"Serial \\(radio and\ntelevision\\)\") format and included melodramatic plot elements such as [alien\nabduction](/wiki/Alien_abduction \"Alien abduction\"), demonic possession,\nmurder, and kidnapping. In 2007 it was listed as one of\n_[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine's \"100 Best TV\nShows of All-_TIME_ \",[2] and in 2010, the Tates and the Campbells ranked at\nnumber 17 in _[TV Guide](/wiki/TV_Guide \"TV Guide\")_ 's list of \"TV's Top\nFamilies\".\n\nThe show was created, written, and executively produced by [Susan\nHarris](/wiki/Susan_Harris_\\(producer\\) \"Susan Harris \\(producer\\)\"), and also\nexecutively produced by [Paul Junger Witt](/wiki/Paul_Junger_Witt \"Paul Junger\nWitt\") (Harris' future husband) and [Tony\nThomas](/wiki/Tony_Thomas_\\(producer\\) \"Tony Thomas \\(producer\\)\"). Each\nreturning season was preceded by a 90-minute retrospective of the previous\nseason. Two of these retrospectives were made available on [VHS](/wiki/VHS\n\"VHS\") in 1994, but were not included on any DVD collections.[3]\n\nThe show aired 85 episodes over the course of four seasons. Eight of these\n(including the final four) aired as one-hour episodes during the original run\non [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting Company\").\nThese hour-long episodes were later split in two, yielding 93 half-hour\nepisodes for syndication. Like most sitcoms of the era, _Soap_ was\n[videotaped](/wiki/Videotape \"Videotape\") rather than [filmed](/wiki/Film\n\"Film\"), but this coincidentally helped further its emulation of the daytime\nsoap opera format, as most such productions were also videotaped.\n\nAll episodes are currently available on region 1 [DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") in\nfour separate [box sets](/wiki/Box_set \"Box set\"). There is a box set of\nseason 1 on region 2 DVD. The series has rerun in syndication on local\nchannels as well as on cable.\n\nThe show starred [Katherine Helmond](/wiki/Katherine_Helmond \"Katherine\nHelmond\") and [Cathryn Damon](/wiki/Cathryn_Damon \"Cathryn Damon\") as\nsisters/matriarchs of their own families. The cast also included three former\nsoap opera actors. [Robert Mandan](/wiki/Robert_Mandan \"Robert Mandan\")\n(Chester Tate) had previously appeared on _[Search for\nTomorrow](/wiki/Search_for_Tomorrow \"Search for Tomorrow\")_ as a leading man\nfor Mary Stuart, and [Donnelly Rhodes](/wiki/Donnelly_Rhodes \"Donnelly\nRhodes\") (Dutch Leitner) had played the first husband of Katherine Chancellor\non _[The Young and the Restless](/wiki/The_Young_and_the_Restless \"The Young\nand the Restless\")_.

The Tates live in a\nwealthy neighborhood (the announcer calls it the neighborhood known as\n\"Rich\"). Jessica Tate ([Katherine Helmond](/wiki/Katherine_Helmond \"Katherine\nHelmond\")) and her husband, Chester ([Robert Mandan](/wiki/Robert_Mandan\n\"Robert Mandan\")), are hardly models of fidelity, as their various love\naffairs result in several family mishaps, including the murder of her sister\nMary's ([Cathryn Damon](/wiki/Cathryn_Damon \"Cathryn Damon\")) stepson, Peter\nCampbell ([Robert Urich](/wiki/Robert_Urich \"Robert Urich\")). Even though\neveryone tells Jessica about Chester's continual affairs, she does not believe\nthem until she sees his philandering with her own eyes: while out to lunch\nwith Mary, Jessica spots Chester [necking](/wiki/Making_out \"Making out\") with\nhis secretary Claire ([Kathryn Reynolds](/wiki/Kathryn_Reynolds \"Kathryn\nReynolds\")). Heartbroken, she sobs in her sister's arms. On later occasions,\nit becomes clear Jess has always known on some level about Chester's affairs\nbut never allowed herself to process the information.\n\nThe wealthy Tate family employs a sarcastic butler/cook named Benson ([Robert\nGuillaume](/wiki/Robert_Guillaume \"Robert Guillaume\")). Benson clearly\ndespises Chester, but has a soft spot for their son, Billy ([Jimmy\nBaio](/wiki/Jimmy_Baio \"Jimmy Baio\")). He also gets along with the Tates'\ndaughter, Corinne ([Diana Canova](/wiki/Diana_Canova \"Diana Canova\")) as well\nas their mother, Jessica; but doesn't speak to the other daughter, Eunice\n([Jennifer Salt](/wiki/Jennifer_Salt \"Jennifer Salt\")), although that later\nchanged. Benson became a popular character and in 1979 left the Tates' employ\nto work for Jessica's cousin, Governor Gene Gatling, on the spin-off series,\n_[Benson](/wiki/Benson_\\(TV_series\\) \"Benson \\(TV series\\)\")_ , wherein his\nlast name, DuBois, was revealed. The Tates had to hire a new butler/cook named\nSaunders ([Roscoe Lee Browne](/wiki/Roscoe_Lee_Browne \"Roscoe Lee Browne\")),\nwhose attitude is similar to that of Benson, but has a more formal\npersonality.\n\nMary's family, the Campbells, are working-class, and as the series begins, her\nson Danny Dallas ([Ted Wass](/wiki/Ted_Wass_\\(actor\\) \"Ted Wass \\(actor\\)\")),\na product of her first marriage to Johnny Dallas, is a junior gangster-in-\ntraining. Danny is told to kill his stepfather, Burt Campbell ([Richard\nMulligan](/wiki/Richard_Mulligan \"Richard Mulligan\")), Mary's current husband,\nwho, Danny is told, murdered his father Johnny, who was also a mobster. It is\nlater revealed that Danny's father was killed by Burt in self-defense. Danny\nrefuses to kill Burt and goes on the run from the Mob in a variety of\ndisguises. This eventually ends when Elaine Lefkowitz (played by [Dinah\nManoff](/wiki/Dinah_Manoff \"Dinah Manoff\") in one of her earliest roles), the\nspoiled daughter of the Mob Boss (played by [Sorrell\nBooke](/wiki/Sorrell_Booke \"Sorrell Booke\")), falls in love with Danny and\nstops her father, who then tells Danny he will have to marry Elaine or he will\nkill him. In the fourth season, it is revealed that Chester is Danny's true\nfather, the product of a secret affair between him and Mary before his\nmarriage to Jessica. Mary's other son, Jodie ([Billy\nCrystal](/wiki/Billy_Crystal \"Billy Crystal\"), in an early role), is gay,\nhaving a secret affair with a famous professional football quarterback, and\ncontemplating a sex-change operation.\n\nThe first season ends with Jessica convicted of the murder of Peter Campbell.\nThe announcer concludes the season by announcing that Jessica is innocent, and\nthat one of five characters—Burt, Chester, Jodie, Benson, or Corinne—killed\nPeter Campbell. Chester later confesses to Peter's murder and is sent to\nprison. He is soon released after a successful temporary insanity defense.\n\nOther plot lines include Jessica's adopted daughter Corinne courting Father\nTim Flotsky ([Sal Viscuso](/wiki/Sal_Viscuso \"Sal Viscuso\")), who ended up\nleaving the priesthood, and the two eventually marrying and having a child who\nis possessed by the Devil; Chester being imprisoned for Peter's murder,\nescaping with his prison roommate Dutch, and being afflicted with amnesia\nafter a failed operation; Jessica's other daughter, Eunice, sleeps with a\nmarried congressman, and then falls in love with Dutch; Mary's stepson Chuck\n([Jay Johnson](/wiki/Jay_Johnson_\\(ventriloquist\\) \"Jay Johnson\n\\(ventriloquist\\)\")), a [ventriloquist](/wiki/Ventriloquist \"Ventriloquist\")\nwhose hostilities are expressed through his alter ego, a quick-witted dummy\nnamed Bob; Jessica's love affairs with several men, including Donahue, a\nprivate investigator hired to find the missing presumed-dead Chester, her\npsychiatrist, and a [Latin American](/wiki/Latin_American \"Latin American\")\n[revolutionary](/wiki/Revolutionary \"Revolutionary\") known as \"El Puerco\"\n(\"The Pig\"; his friends just call him \"El\"); Billy Tate's confinement by a\ncult called the \"Sunnies\" (a parody of [Sun Myung Moon](/wiki/Sun_Myung_Moon\n\"Sun Myung Moon\")'s [Unification Church](/wiki/Unification_Church \"Unification\nChurch\"), called the \"[Moonies](/wiki/Moonies \"Moonies\")\" by its critics), and\nthen his affair with his school teacher who becomes unhinged; Danny and his\nromantic trials with the daughter of a mobster (Elaine, who is murdered in a\nbotched kidnapping), black woman, a prostitute, and Chester's second wife,\nAnnie; and Burt's confinement to a mental institution, his abduction by aliens\nwhile being replaced with an oversexed alien lookalike on Earth, and getting\nblackmailed by the Mob after becoming sheriff of their small town.\n\nAt the beginning of each episode, off-camera announcer [Rod\nRoddy](/wiki/Rod_Roddy \"Rod Roddy\") gives a brief description of the\nconvoluted storyline and remarks, \"Confused? You won't be, after _this_ week's\nepisode of..._Soap_.\" At the end of each episode, he asks a series of life-or-\ndeath questions in a deliberately deadpan style—\"Will Jessica discover\nChester's affair? Will Benson discover Chester's affair? Will Benson care?\"\nand concludes each episode with the trademark line, \"These questions—and many\nothers—will be answered in the next episode of..._Soap_.\"\n\n##\nCharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Soap_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Characters\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Robert_Mandan_Robert_Guillaume_SOAP_1977.JPG/180px-\nRobert_Mandan_Robert_Guillaume_SOAP_1977.JPG)](/wiki/File:Robert_Mandan_Robert_Guillaume_SOAP_1977.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Robert_Mandan_Robert_Guillaume_SOAP_1977.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nChester and Benson.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Tates_Campbells_and_Benson_Soap_1977.JPG/180px-\nTates_Campbells_and_Benson_Soap_1977.JPG)](/wiki/File:Tates_Campbells_and_Benson_Soap_1977.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tates_Campbells_and_Benson_Soap_1977.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Tates and Campbells with Benson.\n\nMain characters\n\n  * **Jessica Tate (née Gatling)** ([Katherine Helmond](/wiki/Katherine_Helmond \"Katherine Helmond\"))—The sister of Mary Campbell and one of the two main characters of the show. She is married to wealthy Chester Tate but separates from and later divorces him in the latter seasons of the series. Sweet-natured, extremely naïve and sheltered, she is often in a world of her own. Her flirtatious nature and hourglass figure make her a frequent target of male attention, but she is honest and loyal to her marriage. She is in denial of her husband's blatant [infidelities](/wiki/Adultery \"Adultery\") throughout Season 1, although everyone repeatedly tells her about him and must listen to her increasingly absurd excuses. In Season 2 when she is accused of murder, she has no concept of the seriousness of her trial, flirting and making jokes with the judge. Later seasons show Jessica as still very sweet, but also stronger and less naïve in that she finally throws Chester out of her life. Helmond is one of the two actors to appear in every episode of the series.\n  * **Chester Tate** ([Robert Mandan](/wiki/Robert_Mandan \"Robert Mandan\"))—A wealthy stock broker and Jessica's constantly philandering husband. According to Benson (and nearly everyone else) he will \"jump on anything that breathes!\" He had affairs with his secretary, Claire ([Kathryn Reynolds](/wiki/Kathryn_Reynolds \"Kathryn Reynolds\")), and, later, with another woman known as \"Pigeon\". It was later revealed that he had an affair with his wife's sister, Mary, and was the biological father of Danny Dallas. Chester and Jessica separate in Season 3 and divorce in Season 4. Although Chester later falls in love with Eunice's friend Annie, and marries her, he still loves Jessica enough to duel for her honor.\n  * **Billy Tate** ([Jimmy Baio](/wiki/Jimmy_Baio \"Jimmy Baio\"))—The youngest child and only son of Jessica and Chester (according to Benson, \"the only one in this family worth a damn\"). He gets caught up in a cult, the Sunnies, (from which Benson has to rescue him), and later has an affair with his high school teacher, Leslie Walker. After he breaks off the affair, she makes multiple failed (and laughable) attempts to kill him and/or his family. He later becomes a general in El Puerco's revolutionary army after rescuing him and Jessica from being lost in the ocean, learning Spanish and becoming very devoted to the revolutionaries' anti-Communist cause, though his family members do not take this seriously.\n  * **Corinne Tate Flotsky** ([Diana Canova](/wiki/Diana_Canova \"Diana Canova\"))—Jessica and Chester's daughter, who acknowledges she slept with most of the male population of Dunn's River. It is later revealed that she is adopted and is really the daughter of Jessica and Mary's long-lost brother Randolph Gatling and family maid Ingrid Svenson. After a disastrous affair with Peter Campbell, Corinne marries ex-priest Tim Flotsky and gives birth to a baby named Timmy who turns out to be demon-possessed (due to Tim's outraged mother, Flo, cursing the marriage). She later has an affair with Dutch Leitner and then leaves Dunn's River for California to raise Timmy, after Dutch leaves her to get back together with Eunice.\n  * **Father Timothy Flotsky** ([Sal Viscuso](/wiki/Sal_Viscuso \"Sal Viscuso\"))—A former Catholic priest who leaves the priesthood to marry Corinne Tate, then later leaves her. Father of Timmy, who was possessed by a demon due to Timothy's possessive unhinged mother ([Doris Roberts](/wiki/Doris_Roberts \"Doris Roberts\"))'s cursing of her son's marriage.\n  * **Eunice Tate-Leitner** ([Jennifer Salt](/wiki/Jennifer_Salt \"Jennifer Salt\"))—Jessica and Chester's daughter. A spoiled social climber, Eunice dates a married congressman in Season 1 and then falls in love with convicted murderer Dutch Leitner and ultimately marries him. (She also enjoys wearing garter belts.) She is looked down upon by Benson, who only speaks to her to zing or insult her, for much of Season 1, although he does begin to talk to her before he leaves the Tate's employ.\n  * **Dutch Leitner** ([Donnelly Rhodes](/wiki/Donnelly_Rhodes \"Donnelly Rhodes\"))—An escaped convict who hides out with the Tates after helping Chester break out of prison. He falls in love with, and eventually marries, Chester's daughter Eunice. Though coarse in his manners, Dutch is grateful for the Tates' acceptance and is genuinely devoted to the family, even while struggling to choose between Eunice and Corinne.\n  * **The Major** ([Arthur Peterson Jr.](/wiki/Arthur_Peterson_Jr. \"Arthur Peterson Jr.\"))—The father of Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell. The Major suffers from dementia and believes he is in the midst of fighting [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"). He often refers to Chester as \"Colonel\". The Major is always in uniform and often irritates Benson and Saunders with his obliviously racist remarks.\n  * **Mary Campbell (née Gatling, previously Dallas)** ([Cathryn Damon](/wiki/Cathryn_Damon \"Cathryn Damon\"))—The sister of Jessica Tate and one of the two main characters of the show. Down-to-earth, sensual and much brighter than her sister, she provides a comic foil to her sister's spaced-out antics. At the start of the series she is married to her second husband, building contractor Burt Campbell. Her first husband, Johnny Dallas, was a mobster who (unknown to Mary) was killed by Burt in self-defense. Eventually, she has a baby with \"alien\" Burt, and by the series' end has slowly become an alcoholic, as no one else (besides Chuck and Bob) sees the baby manifesting alien-esque qualities, such as being able to fly.\n  * **Burt Campbell** ([Richard Mulligan](/wiki/Richard_Mulligan \"Richard Mulligan\"))—Burt is the second husband of Mary Campbell. In contrast to Chester, Burt is a loving family man who has a strong marriage with Mary. Burt is a high-strung building contractor who later becomes sheriff and is under consideration for a run as lieutenant governor. In Season 1, Burt suffers from mental illness due to his guilt over accidentally killing Mary's first husband, and the murder of his son Peter. For a time, he believes he can make himself invisible by snapping his fingers. He is also at one point abducted by aliens and replaced with X-23, an alien Burt lookalike (also played by Mulligan). Only Mary and Jodie know that Burt's abduction was real. At the end of Season 3, Burt becomes sheriff and gets increasingly involved in politics, leading him to ignore his family, putting his marriage at risk. Mulligan is also one of the two actors to appear in every episode of the series.\n  * **Chuck and Bob Campbell** ([Jay Johnson](/wiki/Jay_Johnson_\\(ventriloquist\\) \"Jay Johnson \\(ventriloquist\\)\"))—Chuck is Burt Campbell's son by his first marriage. A ventriloquist, he is always accompanied by Bob, his dummy and alter ego. The pair dress alike and are always referred to as \"Chuck and Bob\". While Chuck is mild-mannered, introverted, and polite, Bob is aggressive, rude and abrasive. All of the main characters with the exception of Benson and Saunders find themselves conversing with or referring to Bob as a real person, even in the face of fierce determination not to. Also, the dummy was often threatened with or has been the target of physical violence by nearly everyone, due to its obnoxiousness.\n  * **Danny Dallas** ([Ted Wass](/wiki/Ted_Wass_\\(actor\\) \"Ted Wass \\(actor\\)\"))—Mary Campbell's eldest son. Sweet-natured, good-looking but not particularly bright, he is a low-level gangster due to his late father's membership, not due to any aptitude or desire of his own. He is given the task of killing his stepfather Burt, but can't bring himself to do so, and as a result spends most of Season 1 on the run, popping up in ludicrous disguises. It is widely assumed that he is the son of Mary's first husband Johnny Dallas but in later episodes it is revealed that his real father is Chester Tate (born from an illicit affair Chester had with his mother, Mary). He is very protective of his younger half-brother Jodie, but is initially in denial about Jodie's homosexuality. Danny is forced to marry Elaine, the mob boss's daughter. He eventually falls in love with her; she was later kidnapped and killed. Danny later gets involved in a series of failed relationships, including a girlfriend of one of Elaine's kidnappers, an African-American woman, a prostitute, and Chester's new wife, Annie. When Chester finds them [_[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_] in bed together, he plans to shoot them both (this was a series cliffhanger).[_[why?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_] Danny also becomes Burt's enthusiastic but inept deputy sheriff.\n  * **[Jodie Dallas](/wiki/Jodie_Dallas \"Jodie Dallas\")** ([Billy Crystal](/wiki/Billy_Crystal \"Billy Crystal\"))—The son of Mary Campbell and her first husband Johnny Dallas. An openly gay man, he shares his mother's common sense and pleasant temperament. He at first is dating a closeted football player but later fathers a daughter (Wendy) with Carol, an attorney who seduces him after meeting at his aunt Jessica's murder trial. After Carol runs off to join the rodeo, Wendy is left with Jodie, triggering a custody battle and a kidnapping. The series ends with Jodie believing himself to be an old Jewish man, Julius Kassendorf, due to a failed [hypnotherapy](/wiki/Hypnotherapy \"Hypnotherapy\") session.\n  * **Peter Campbell** ([Robert Urich](/wiki/Robert_Urich \"Robert Urich\"))—Burt Campbell's sleazy tennis pro son by his first marriage, he is carrying on affairs with both Jessica and Corinne, as well as numerous other women around town. His murder in Season 1 leads to the first-season cliffhanger: the question of who killed Peter Campbell.\n  * **Benson** ([Robert Guillaume](/wiki/Robert_Guillaume \"Robert Guillaume\"))—The Tates' wisecracking African-American cook/butler in the early seasons, who shows utter contempt for Chester. He is frequently the target of the Major's racist quips, but Benson has a soft spot for Jessica, Corinne, and most notably Billy. He completely ignores Eunice while she is secretly dating the Congressman, but this changes after Season 1. In 1979, Benson leaves to be the head of household affairs for Jessica's cousin, Governor Eugene Gatling, in the spin-off, _[Benson](/wiki/Benson_\\(TV_series\\) \"Benson \\(TV series\\)\")_ , wherein he is later revealed to have the last name of DuBois. Benson makes a brief re-appearance when Jessica is diagnosed with a fatal disease.\n  * **Saunders** ([Roscoe Lee Browne](/wiki/Roscoe_Lee_Browne \"Roscoe Lee Browne\"))—Benson's African-American replacement as the Tates' cook/butler, with a disdainful attitude similar to Benson's, although with a more cultured and polished personality.\n\nAnnouncer\n\n  * [Rod Roddy](/wiki/Rod_Roddy \"Rod Roddy\") (Originally slated to be [Casey Kasem](/wiki/Casey_Kasem \"Casey Kasem\"), who left after the pilot episode due to the show's content)\n\nRecurring characters\n\n  * **Barney Gerber** ([Harold Gould](/wiki/Harold_Gould \"Harold Gould\"))—elderly hospital patient who shares a room with Jodie in Season 1, and whose story gives Jodie the inspiration to continue living after a suicide attempt.\n  * **Detective Donahue** ([John Byner](/wiki/John_Byner \"John Byner\"))—hired by Jessica to find the missing amnesiac Chester in Season 2, he falls for Jessica, forcing her to choose between the two when Chester returns home.\n  * **Dennis Phillips** ([Bob Seagren](/wiki/Bob_Seagren \"Bob Seagren\"))—A quarterback who is dating Jodie secretly in Season 1 and more openly in early Season 2 after the failure of his sham marriage.\n  * **Ingrid Svenson** ([Inga Swenson](/wiki/Inga_Swenson \"Inga Swenson\"))—Corinne's biological mother, who was the former maid of Jessica and Mary's parents, and who was in love with Jessica and Mary's brother, Randolph Gatling. She attempts to carry out revenge upon the Tate/Campbell family for opposing her romance with Randolph. She tries to influence Jessica's murder trial by sleeping with the judge and blackmailing Sally into trying to break up Burt and Mary's marriage.\n  * **E. Ronald Mallu, Esq.** ([Eugene Roche](/wiki/Eugene_Roche \"Eugene Roche\"))—High priced attorney who defends Jessica in her murder trial. Mallu returns in Season 3 to represent Jodie in his custody case, and attempts to date the newly separated Jessica as well. Mallu is a thinly veiled [caricature](/wiki/Caricature \"Caricature\") of the defense attorney [F. Lee Bailey](/wiki/F._Lee_Bailey \"F. Lee Bailey\").\n  * **The Godfather** ([Richard Libertini](/wiki/Richard_Libertini \"Richard Libertini\")), mob over-boss who orders Danny to kill Burt (the killer of Danny's father) in Season 1.

Two of the affiliates, neither\nin a major market, privately told ABC that the show was \"raunchy\" and its\nsubject matter not fit for television.[5]\n\nIn June 1977, a _Newsweek_ preview of the fall season written by Harry F.\nWaters panned the show while mischaracterizing some of its basic plot elements\nand offering exaggerated reports of its sexual content. Despite having not\nseen the pilot, Waters called the show a \"sex farce\" and claimed (erroneously)\nthat the show included a scene of a Catholic priest being seduced in a\nconfessional.[6] Waters also stated:\n\n> _Soap_ promises to be the most controversial network series of the coming\n> season, a show so saturated with sex that it could replace violence as the\n> [PTA](/wiki/Parent-Teacher_Association \"Parent-Teacher Association\")'s Video\n> Enemy No. 1.\n>\n> — Harry F. Waters[7]\n\nWhether Waters' errors and misrepresentations were intentional or accidental\nis unknown.\n\nWithin days of the _Newsweek_ report, a number of local and national religious\norganizations began to quickly mobilize against _Soap_ , despite the fact that\nthey also had not seen the pilot. Among these were the [National Council of\nChurches](/wiki/National_Council_of_Churches \"National Council of Churches\"),\nthe [United Church of Christ](/wiki/United_Church_of_Christ \"United Church of\nChrist\"), the [United Methodist Church](/wiki/United_Methodist_Church \"United\nMethodist Church\"), the [National Council of Catholic\nBishops](/wiki/United_States_Catholic_Conference \"United States Catholic\nConference\") and the Christian Life Commission of the [Southern Baptist\nConvention](/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention \"Southern Baptist\nConvention\"),[8] the latter of which went so far as to divest itself of 2,500\nshares of ABC stock \"because the board does not approve of programming related\nto the abuse of human sexuality, violence and perversion\".[9]\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, led by its Los Angeles Archdiocese, also condemned\nthe show and asked all American families to boycott it saying \"ABC should be\ntold that American Catholics and all Americans are not going to sit by and\nwatch the networks have open season on Catholicism and morality. [_Soap_] is\nprobably one of the most effective arguments for government censorship of TV\nthat has yet come along.\"[10] In August, the Board of Rabbis of Southern\nCalifornia representing three branches of Judaism, joined the Catholic protest\nsaying that the as-yet unaired show \"reached a new low\".\n\nDr. Everett Parker of the United Church of Christ called _Soap_ \"a low-life,\nsalacious program\" and complained that the show would be airing when children\nwould be able to watch it. (ABC had scheduled it on Tuesdays after _[Happy\nDays](/wiki/Happy_Days \"Happy Days\")_ and _[Laverne&\nShirley](/wiki/Laverne_%26_Shirley \"Laverne & Shirley\")_, two of the most\npopular family television shows being broadcast at the time.)[11]\n\nThese religious groups organized a letter-writing campaign designed to\npressure the show's sponsors not to advertise on the network.[12] Although\nsome of the religious groups asked their members to watch the show first, and\nthen inform ABC of their feelings about it,[8] others began working hard to\nget ABC to cancel the show before it premiered. One ABC vice president was\nshocked to learn that his 11-year-old child was required by a parochial school\nteacher to write a letter of protest to ABC to take the show off the air.[13]\nIn the end, 32,000 people wrote letters to ABC,[8] all but nine of them\nagainst it.[14]\n\nIn addition to the religious protest, _Soap_ also faced substantial pre-\nbroadcast criticism from the International Union of Gay Athletes[15] and the\n[National Gay Task Force](/wiki/National_Gay_and_Lesbian_Task_Force \"National\nGay and Lesbian Task Force\"),[16] both of which were concerned about the way\nthe gay character Jodie Dallas and how his professional football player lover\nwould be portrayed.\n\nTo allay the concern of advertisers, some of whom had begun to cancel\nsponsorship of the program, ABC reluctantly dropped the price for commercial\ntime from $75,000 per spot to $40,000 per spot. When _Soap_ premiered on\nSeptember 13, 1977, 18 out of 195 ABC affiliates had refused to air the\nprogram with others choosing to broadcast it after 11pm. By its second week on\nthe air, two more affiliates dropped out, bringing the boycott to 20\nstations.[13]\n\n## \"The _Soap_\nMemo\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Soap_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: \"The Soap Memo\"\")]\n\nAside from the external protests, _Soap_ was also subject to heavy internal\nrevisions from ABC's Broadcast Standards & Practices department, which\nmonitors the content of programs. Writer/creator Susan Harris had developed a\n[story arc](/wiki/Story_arc \"Story arc\") for _Soap_ in the form of a \"show\nbible\" which traced all the major characters, stories and events for five\nseasons. The Standards & Practices executives (commonly referred to as\n\"censors\") reviewed this extensive bible as well as the script for the two-\npart pilot and issued a long memo to Harris voicing their concerns about\nvarious story lines and characters. In addition to the sexual material that\nwas widely reported in the press, the censors also took issue with the show's\nreligious, political, and ethnic content.[17]\n\n\"The _Soap_ Memo\" was leaked to the press before the show premiered and was\nprinted in its entirety in the _[Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times\n\"Los Angeles Times\")_ on June 27, 1977. Among their notes were:\n\n    \n\n  * \"Please delete [the lines] '...the slut', 'that Polish slut,' 'get your clothes off,' 'it doesn't grow back,' 'transsexual,' 'Oh my God,' 'did it hurt?'\"\n  * \"Substitute [the words] 'fruit,' 'slut,' 'tinker bell.'\"\n  * \"The CIA or any other government organization is not to be involved in General Nu's smuggling operation.\" (This character and storyline, which dealt with a Vietnamese opium smuggler who becomes involved in the Tate family through Jessica's long-lost son, was eventually removed from the show bible.)\n  * \"In order to treat Jodie as a gay character, his portrayal must at all times be handled without 'limp-wristed' actions\"\n  * \"The colloquy between Peter and Jessica...which relates to [cunnilingus](/wiki/Cunnilingus \"Cunnilingus\")/[fellatio](/wiki/Fellatio \"Fellatio\") is obviously unacceptable\"\n  * \"The relationship between Jodie and the football player should be handled in such a manner that explicit or intimate aspects of homosexuality are avoided entirely.\"\n  * \"Father Flotsky's stand on liberalizing the Mass will have to be treated in a balanced, inoffensive manner. By way of example, the substitution of [Oreos](/wiki/Oreo \"Oreo\") for the traditional wafer is unacceptable.\"\n\n\"The _Soap_ Memo\" also contained notes that were subsequently disregarded by\nthe producers including:\n\n    \n\n  * \"Please change Burt Campbell's last name to avoid association with the Campbell Soup Co.\"\n  * \"Corinne's affair with a Jesuit priest, her subsequent pregnancy as a result, and later exorcism, are all unacceptable.\"\n  * \"Please direct Claire to dump the hot coffee in some part of Chester's anatomy other than his crotch.\" (Susan Harris later responded to this note: \"so we didn't—we poured it in his _lap._ \")\n\n\"The _Soap_ Memo\" was a rare public look into the behind-the-scenes process at\na major network and copies of the document were often found posted on the\nbulletin boards of television production companies and on studio sets as a\nrallying point against censorship. In addition, the specific details in the\nmemo further fueled the growing debate regarding the controversial content of\n_Soap._\n\n## Premiere and critical\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Soap_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Premiere and critical reception\")]\n\n_Soap_ premiered on Tuesday, September 13, 1977 at 9:30pm. The show was\npreceded by a disclaimer that the show \"was part of a continuing character\ncomedy\" that included adult themes and that \"viewer discretion\" was advised.\nThe disclaimer was both displayed on the screen and read by _Soap_ announcer\n[Rod Roddy](/wiki/Rod_Roddy \"Rod Roddy\"). It would remain throughout the first\nseason before being dropped.\n\nMuch of _Soap 's_ controversy, among liberals and conservatives alike,\nironically actually helped to sell the series to the general public. Fueled by\nsix months of pre-show protests (as well as a solid lead-in from the hit shows\n_[Happy Days](/wiki/Happy_Days \"Happy Days\")_ , _[Laverne&\nShirley](/wiki/Laverne_%26_Shirley \"Laverne & Shirley\")_ and _[Three's\nCompany](/wiki/Three%27s_Company \"Three's Company\")_), the first episode swept\nits time slot with a 25.6 rating and 39% share (39% of the national audience).\nAlthough ABC received hundreds of phone calls after the premiere, executives\nat the network described initial public reaction as \"mild\" with more calls in\nfavor of the show than in protest. A [University of\nRichmond](/wiki/University_of_Richmond \"University of Richmond\") poll found\nthat 74% of viewers found _Soap_ inoffensive, 26% found it offensive, and half\nof those who were offended said they planned to watch it the next week.[6]\n\nInitial reviews—somewhat clouded by the controversy—were mixed, with negative\nreviews predictably focusing on the show's racy content. The _Los Angeles\nTimes_ called the show \"a prolonged dirty joke\" that \"is without cleverness or\nstyle or subtlety. Its sex jokes are delivered by the shovelful, like manure.\"\n_[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_ called the show\n\"forced and derivative\", \"bland\" and \"predictable and silly\" while conceding\nthat the sex is \"no more outrageous than daytime soapers, no more outspoken\nthan _Three 's Company._\"[18]\n\n_[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine praised the\n\"talented cast\" and singled out Jimmy Baio and Billy Crystal as \"sharp young\ncomedians\", but felt the show suffered from \"nastiness\" and \"lacked\ncompassion\".[12]\n\nOn the more positive side, _[TV Guide](/wiki/TV_Guide \"TV Guide\")_ gave the\nshow a good review saying that there was \"a heap of talent\" in the cast and\nasking \"It is funny? Yes it is...and I guess that constitutes redeeming social\nvalue\".[19]\n\nHarry F. Waters' 1977 _[Newsweek](/wiki/Newsweek \"Newsweek\")_ review proved\nprescient of conservative reaction when the following year, the National\n[PTA](/wiki/Parent-teacher_association \"Parent-teacher association\") declared\n_Soap_ one of \"ten worst\" shows in television. In spite of this designation,\n_Soap_ ranked #13 for the 1977–78 season[6] and went on to gain positive\ncritical reviews and high ratings over the rest of its four-year run.\n\n## Later seasons and\ncancellation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Soap_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Later seasons and cancellation\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png) |  This article **possibly contains[original research](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research \"Wikipedia:No original research\")**.

Social conservatives opposed the character on religious\ngrounds, while some gay rights activists were also upset with the character of\nJodie, arguing that certain story developments reinforced negative\nstereotypes, e.g. his desire to have a sex change operation, or represented a\ndesire to change or downplay his sexual orientation.\n\nBefore the start of the second season, ABC ran a 90-minute retrospective [clip\nshow](/wiki/Clip_show \"Clip show\") called \"Who Killed Peter?\" in which Burt\nCampbell visits Jessica Tate in prison as she awaits the verdict of her murder\ntrial. The two discuss each of the show's individual characters and their\npossible motives for killing Burt's son Peter using flashbacks to illustrate\nspecific story lines. The show was designed to remind viewers of what happened\nin Season 1 to prepare them for the upcoming season.\n\nAt the start of season three, another 90-minute retrospective aired in which\nJessica says goodbye to Benson, using the flashback clips to try to explain\nwhy he should stay. This show also served to help launch the spinoff\n_[Benson](/wiki/Benson_\\(TV_series\\) \"Benson \\(TV series\\)\")_ , which was\npremiering at the start of the 1979–80 season.\n\nA third 90-minute retrospective titled \"Jessica's Wonderful Life\" aired at the\nstart of Season 4. Jessica, who had just died in hospital, found herself in\nheaven speaking to an angel (played by [Bea Arthur](/wiki/Bea_Arthur \"Bea\nArthur\")). Jessica explained via the flashback clips why she was not ready to\ndie and had to return to earth to help her family.\n\nAlthough Susan Harris had planned for five seasons of _Soap_ , the program was\nabruptly canceled by ABC after its fourth season. Therefore, the final one-\nhour episode, which originally aired on April 20, 1981, did not serve as a\n[series finale](/wiki/Series_finale \"Series finale\") and instead ended with\nseveral unresolved [cliffhangers](/wiki/Cliffhanger \"Cliffhanger\"). These\ninvolve a [suicidal](/wiki/Suicidal \"Suicidal\") Chester preparing to kill\nDanny and Annie (his son and wife) after catching them in bed together, an\nirreversibly hypnotized Jodie believing himself to be a 90-year-old Jewish\nman, Burt preparing to walk into an [ambush](/wiki/Ambush \"Ambush\")\norchestrated by his political enemies, and Jessica about to be executed by a\n[Communist](/wiki/Communism \"Communism\") [firing squad](/wiki/Firing_squad\n\"Firing squad\"). [Vlasic Foods](/wiki/Vlasic_Pickles \"Vlasic Pickles\") pulled\ntheir sponsorship of the program shortly after this episode aired and ABC\nannounced that the program was not picked up for its planned fifth season. The\nofficial reason given by the network was its declining ratings. However,\naccording to the Museum of Broadcast Communications, _Soap_ \"ended under\nsuspicion that resistance from ad agencies may have caused ABC to cancel [it]\nat that point\" because its still controversial content was negatively\naffecting its relationship with sponsors.[6]\n\nA 1983 episode of _[Benson](/wiki/Benson_\\(TV_series\\) \"Benson \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ mentions Jessica's disappearance, noting the Tate family is\nseeking to have her declared legally dead.
