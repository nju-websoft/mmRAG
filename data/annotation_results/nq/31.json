Jackson\") starring as Axel\nFoley's son, Aaron.[6] The hour long crime drama was produced by the\ncritically acclaimed writer [Shawn Ryan](/wiki/Shawn_Ryan \"Shawn Ryan\") who\ncreated _[The Shield](/wiki/The_Shield \"The Shield\")_ and _[The Chicago\nCode](/wiki/The_Chicago_Code \"The Chicago Code\")_.[7]\n\nIn January 2013, Ryan stated, \"It's going to be a CBS procedural. We're going\nto solve a case every week, but we're going to do it with a lot of humor and a\nlot of fun. And I would say the stealth thing I would like to get in is, in a\nday and age when income inequality and class inequities dominate a lot of the\ncountry, this is going to be an opportunity to put a young working-class kid\nin Detroit in the middle of Beverly Hills, you can do a lot of stealth social\ncommentary. My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The\npilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and\nreally dangerous, that would be something that you might have seen on _Chicago\nCode_ or _The Shield_. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be\nsome opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first\nshow.\"[8]\n\nIn February 2013, [Kevin Pollak](/wiki/Kevin_Pollak \"Kevin Pollak\") was cast\nas Rodney Daloof, an irritating and incredibly risk-averse in-house attorney\nfor the Beverly Hills Police Department.[9] [David Denman](/wiki/David_Denman\n\"David Denman\") was cast as Brad, an honest and likable but socially awkward\ndetective, formerly a baseball player and a musician.[10] Director [Barry\nSonnenfeld](/wiki/Barry_Sonnenfeld \"Barry Sonnenfeld\") agreed to both direct\nthe _Beverly Hills Cop_ pilot and serve as an executive producer.[11] In May\n2013, CBS decided to pass on the _Beverly Hills Cop_ TV series.[12] In August\n2013, Brandon T. Jackson give his reason about the pass:\n\n> I think we were very edgy for CBS. I think we were the edgiest as you\n> could've went for CBS. It would have been like a '[Fresh\n> Prince](/wiki/The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\")'\n> thing on CBS, like the edgiest you can go on network TV. But it doesn't\n> agree to our franchise man.\"[13]\n\nIn February 2015, Eddie Murphy stated that his cameo appearance in the pilot\nironically doomed the show's chances: \"I was gonna be in the pilot, and they\nthought I should be recurring. I’m not gonna do Beverly Hills Cop on TV. I\nremember when they tested it — they had this little knob that you turn if you\nlike it or you don’t like it. So when Axel shows up in the pilot, some people\nturned the knob so much, they broke it. So the network decided 'if he isn’t\nrecurring, then this isn’t gonna happen.' So it didn’t happen.\"[14]\n\nIn a January 2016 interview, Shawn Ryan blamed personality clashes with the\nnetwork: \"The official answer is they decided they liked other pilots better.\nIf you look at what pilots they picked up that year, I think that's kind of\nincredible. I would say there were a lot of 400 lb. gorillas involved in the\nshow and sometimes the gorillas don’t always get along.\". He also said that he\nwas very proud of the pilot and loved working with Murphy.[15]\n\nDuring late Summer 2013, after CBS decided to pass on the TV series, Paramount\ndecided to move forward with the fourth film.\n\n### Cast and\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Beverly_Hills_Cop_\\(film_series\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Cast and characters\")]\n\nCharacter | Films  \n---|---  \n_[Beverly Hills Cop](/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop \"Beverly Hills Cop\")_ | _[Beverly Hills Cop II](/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop_II \"Beverly Hills Cop II\")_ | _[Beverly Hills Cop III](/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop_III \"Beverly Hills Cop III\")_  \n[Axel Foley](/wiki/Axel_Foley \"Axel Foley\") | [Eddie Murphy](/wiki/Eddie_Murphy \"Eddie Murphy\")  \nBilly Rosewood | [Judge Reinhold](/wiki/Judge_Reinhold \"Judge Reinhold\")  \nJenny Summers | [Lisa Eilbacher](/wiki/Lisa_Eilbacher \"Lisa Eilbacher\") |   \nJohn Taggart | [John Ashton](/wiki/John_Ashton_\\(actor\\) \"John Ashton \\(actor\\)\") |   \nAndrew Bogomil | [Ronny Cox](/wiki/Ronny_Cox \"Ronny Cox\") |   \nG.

In an interview\nwith _[Empire](/wiki/Empire_\\(film_magazine\\) \"Empire \\(film magazine\\)\")_\nmagazine, Ratner stated \"I'm working very hard on the fourth. It's very\ndifficult, especially since there were three before. We're trying to figure\nout some important things, like where do we start? Is Axel retired? Is he in\nBeverly Hills? Is he on vacation? Does Judge Reinhold return as the loveable\nBilly Rosewood? Many questions to figure out, but I'm hoping to have a script\nbefore film disappears from our existence.\"[19] Although Murphy himself\ncommitted to the project, it was unconfirmed whether the series' other\nprincipal actors, [Judge Reinhold](/wiki/Judge_Reinhold \"Judge Reinhold\"),\n[John Ashton](/wiki/John_Ashton_\\(actor\\) \"John Ashton \\(actor\\)\"), [Ronny\nCox](/wiki/Ronny_Cox \"Ronny Cox\") or [Bronson Pinchot](/wiki/Bronson_Pinchot\n\"Bronson Pinchot\") would also return,[29] though Ratner stated in late 2009\nthat he was trying to convince Reinhold and Ashton to reprise their roles.[30]\n[Harold Faltermeyer](/wiki/Harold_Faltermeyer \"Harold Faltermeyer\")'s \"[Axel\nF](/wiki/Axel_F \"Axel F\")\", however, would definitely be returning for the\nproposed fourth installment, with Ratner quoted as saying \"It'll be back but\nit'll be a whole new interpretation.\"[31] On November 15, 2010, Ratner stated\nin an interview with MTV that there was still a possibility that they will\nmake a fourth film, but that it wouldn't be \"anytime soon.\"[32]\n\nIn October 2011, Murphy discussed a possible fourth film, stating, \"They're\nnot doing it. What I'm trying to do now is produce a TV show starring Axel\nFoley's son, and Axel is the chief of police now in Detroit. I'd do the pilot,\nshow up here and there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to\nforce the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn't be doing it.\nIt was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong.\"[33]\n\nDuring late Summer 2013, after CBS decided to pass on the TV series, Paramount\ndecided to move forward with the fourth film. On September 13, 2013, Jerry\nBruckheimer, stated he was in talks to produce. On December 6, 2013, it was\nannounced that Eddie Murphy will again reprise the role of Axel Foley and\nBrett Ratner will direct.[34] On May 2, 2014, Deadline announced that\nscreenwriters [Josh Appelbaum](/wiki/Josh_Appelbaum \"Josh Appelbaum\") and\n[Andre Nemec](/wiki/Andre_Nemec \"Andre Nemec\") would be penning the\nscreenplay.[5]\n\nOn June 27, 2014, in an interview with _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone\n\"Rolling Stone\")_ , Murphy discussed returning to the edgier type character of\nAxel Foley after years of making family friendly films. \"I haven't done a\nstreet guy, working class, blue-collar character in ages so maybe it's like,\n'Oh, wow, I didn't remember he was able to do that,'\" Murphy said. According\nto studio reports on the film's plot, Foley will return to Detroit after\nleaving his job in Beverly Hills and he will be faced with the coldest winter\non record to navigate the new rules and old enemies of one of America's most\ntenacious cities. The state of Michigan approved $13.5 million in film\nincentives, based on an estimated $56.6 million of filmmaker spending in the\nstate. The film will be shot in and around Detroit and is estimated to provide\njobs for 352 workers. The film was originally scheduled for a March 25, 2016\nrelease,[35] but on May 6, 2015, Paramount Pictures pulled _Beverly Hills Cop\nIV_ from its release schedule, due to script concerns.[36][37] On June 14,\n2016, [Deadline.com](/wiki/Deadline.com \"Deadline.com\") reported that Adil El\nArbi and Bilall Fallah, directors of the Belgian drama\n_[Black](/wiki/Black_\\(2015_Belgian_film\\) \"Black \\(2015 Belgian film\\)\")_ ,\nwould direct the film.[38]\n\nIn January 2017, it was revealed that a new entry in the franchise will\ncommence filming in June 2017 with Eddie Murphy reprising his role as Axel\nFoley, and Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah as directors.[39][40]\n\n##\nCrew[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Beverly_Hills_Cop_\\(film_series\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Crew\")]\n\nFilm | Director | Producer | Writer(s) | Composer | Editor | Cinematographer  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_[Beverly Hills Cop](/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop \"Beverly Hills Cop\")_ | [Martin Brest](/wiki/Martin_Brest \"Martin Brest\") | [Don Simpson](/wiki/Don_Simpson \"Don Simpson\")  \n[Jerry Bruckheimer](/wiki/Jerry_Bruckheimer \"Jerry Bruckheimer\") | screenplay: [Daniel Petrie, Jr.](/wiki/Daniel_Petrie,_Jr. \"Daniel Petrie, Jr.\")  \nstory: [Danilo Bach](/wiki/Danilo_Bach \"Danilo Bach\")  \n[Daniel Petrie, Jr.](/wiki/Daniel_Petrie,_Jr. \"Daniel Petrie, Jr.\") | [Harold Faltermeyer](/wiki/Harold_Faltermeyer \"Harold Faltermeyer\") | Arthur Coburn  \n[Billy Weber](/wiki/Billy_Weber \"Billy Weber\") | [Bruce Surtees](/wiki/Bruce_Surtees \"Bruce Surtees\")  \n_[Beverly Hills Cop II](/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop_II \"Beverly Hills Cop II\")_ | [Tony Scott](/wiki/Tony_Scott \"Tony Scott\") | screenplay: [Larry Ferguson](/wiki/Larry_Ferguson_\\(screenwriter\\) \"Larry Ferguson \\(screenwriter\\)\")  \nstory: [Eddie Murphy](/wiki/Eddie_Murphy \"Eddie Murphy\")  \nRobert D.
