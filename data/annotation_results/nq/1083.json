He composed the scores for 11 of the _[James\nBond](/wiki/James_Bond_in_film \"James Bond in film\")_ films between 1963 and\n1987, and also arranged and performed the \"[James Bond\nTheme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme \"James Bond Theme\")\" to the first film in the\nseries, 1962's _[Dr. No](/wiki/Dr._No_\\(film\\) \"Dr. No \\(film\\)\")_. He wrote\nthe Grammy- and Academy Award-winning scores to the films _[Dances with\nWolves](/wiki/Dances_with_Wolves \"Dances with Wolves\")_ and _[Out of\nAfrica](/wiki/Out_of_Africa_\\(film\\) \"Out of Africa \\(film\\)\")_ , as well as\nthe theme for the British television cult series _[The\nPersuaders!](/wiki/The_Persuaders! \"The Persuaders!\")_ , in a career spanning\nover 50 years. In 1999, he was appointed OBE at [Buckingham\nPalace](/wiki/Buckingham_Palace \"Buckingham Palace\") for services to music.\n\nBorn in [York](/wiki/York \"York\"), Barry spent his early years working in\ncinemas owned by his father. During his [national\nservice](/wiki/National_service \"National service\") with the British Army in\nCyprus, Barry began performing as a musician after learning to play the\ntrumpet. Upon completing his national service, he formed his own band in 1957,\n[The John Barry Seven](/wiki/The_John_Barry_Seven \"The John Barry Seven\"). He\nlater developed an interest in composing and arranging music, making his début\nfor television in 1958. He came to the notice of the makers of the first James\nBond film _[Dr. No](/wiki/Dr._No_\\(film\\) \"Dr. No \\(film\\)\")_ , who were\ndissatisfied with a theme for [James Bond](/wiki/James_Bond \"James Bond\")\ngiven to them by [Monty Norman](/wiki/Monty_Norman \"Monty Norman\"). This\nstarted a successful association between Barry and [Eon\nProductions](/wiki/Eon_Productions \"Eon Productions\") that lasted for 25\nyears.\n\nHe received many awards for his work, including five [Academy\nAwards](/wiki/Academy_Awards \"Academy Awards\"); two for _[Born\nFree](/wiki/Born_Free \"Born Free\")_ , and one each for _[The Lion in\nWinter](/wiki/The_Lion_in_Winter_\\(1968_film\\) \"The Lion in Winter \\(1968\nfilm\\)\")_ (for which he also won the first [BAFTA Award for Best Film\nMusic](/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Film_Music \"BAFTA Award for Best Film\nMusic\")), _Dances with Wolves_ and _Out of Africa_ (both of which also won him\n[Grammy Awards](/wiki/Grammy_Award \"Grammy Award\")). He also received ten\n[Golden Globe Award](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award \"Golden Globe Award\")\nnominations, winning once for [Best Original\nScore](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Original_Score \"Golden Globe Award\nfor Best Original Score\") for _Out of Africa_ in 1986. Barry completed his\nlast film score, [_Enigma_](/wiki/Enigma_\\(2001_film\\) \"Enigma \\(2001\nfilm\\)\"), in 2001 and recorded the successful album _[Eternal\nEchoes](/wiki/Eternal_Echoes \"Eternal Echoes\")_ the same year. He then\nconcentrated chiefly on live performances and co-wrote the music to the\nmusical _Brighton Rock_ in 2004 alongside [Don\nBlack](/wiki/Don_Black_\\(lyricist\\) \"Don Black \\(lyricist\\)\"). In 2001, Barry\nbecame a Fellow of the [British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and\nAuthors](/wiki/British_Academy_of_Songwriters,_Composers_and_Authors \"British\nAcademy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors\"), and, in 2005, he was made a\nFellow of the [British Academy of Film and Television\nArts](/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts \"British Academy of\nFilm and Television Arts\"). Barry was married four times and had four\nchildren. He moved to the United States in 1975 and lived there for the\nremainder of his life until his death in 2011.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Biography\n    * 1.1 Early life and education\n    * 1.2 Career\n    * 1.3 _James Bond_ series\n    * 1.4 Personal life and death\n  * 2 Awards and nominations\n    * 2.1 Accolades\n  * 3 Discography\n    * 3.1 Bond films\n    * 3.2 Other film scores\n    * 3.3 Television themes\n    * 3.4 Musicals\n    * 3.5 Other works\n    * 3.6 Singles\n    * 3.7 Sampled by other artists\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 Further reading\n  * 6 External links\n\n##\nBiography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Barry_\\(composer\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Biography\")]\n\n### Early life and\neducation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Barry_\\(composer\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Early life and education\")]\n\nBarry was born John Barry Prendergast, in [York](/wiki/York \"York\"), England,\nand was the son of an English mother and an Irish father. His mother was a\nclassical pianist. His father, John Xavier \"Jack\" Prendergast, from\n[Cork](/wiki/Cork_\\(city\\) \"Cork \\(city\\)\"), was a\n[projectionist](/wiki/Projectionist \"Projectionist\") during the silent film\nera, who later owned a chain of cinemas across [northern\nEngland](/wiki/Northern_England \"Northern England\").[3][4][5] As a result of\nhis father's work, Barry was raised in and around cinemas in northern\nEngland[3] and he later stated that this childhood background influenced his\nmusical tastes and interests.[4] Barry was educated at [St Peter's School,\nYork](/wiki/St_Peter%27s_School,_York \"St Peter's School, York\"), and also\nreceived composition lessons from [Francis\nJackson](/wiki/Francis_Jackson_\\(composer\\) \"Francis Jackson \\(composer\\)\"),\nOrganist of [York Minster](/wiki/York_Minster \"York Minster\").[4]\n\n###\nCareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Barry_\\(composer\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Career\")]\n\nServing in the [British Army](/wiki/British_Army \"British Army\"), Barry spent\nhis national service playing the trumpet.[6] During his army service, he took\na correspondence course (with [jazz](/wiki/Jazz \"Jazz\") composer [Bill\nRusso](/wiki/William_Russo_\\(musician\\) \"William Russo \\(musician\\)\")); he\nalso worked as an [arranger](/wiki/Arrangement \"Arrangement\") for the [Jack\nParnell](/wiki/Jack_Parnell \"Jack Parnell\") and [Ted Heath's\nOrchestra](/wiki/Ted_Heath_\\(musician\\) \"Ted Heath \\(musician\\)\"),[7] and\nformed his own band in 1957, [the John Barry Seven](/wiki/The_John_Barry_Seven\n\"The John Barry Seven\"),[8] with whom he had some hit records on [EMI's\nColumbia](/wiki/Columbia_Graphophone_Company \"Columbia Graphophone Company\")\nlabel. These included \"Hit and Miss\", the theme tune he composed for the BBC's\n_[Juke Box Jury](/wiki/Juke_Box_Jury \"Juke Box Jury\")_ programme, a cover of\nthe [Johnny Smith](/wiki/Johnny_Smith \"Johnny Smith\") song \"[Walk Don't\nRun](/wiki/Walk_Don%27t_Run_\\(song\\) \"Walk Don't Run \\(song\\)\")\", and a cover\nof the theme for the United Artists western _[The Magnificent\nSeven](/wiki/The_Magnificent_Seven \"The Magnificent Seven\")_.\n\nBy 1959 Barry was gaining commissions to arrange music for other acts,\nstarting with a young trio on Decca, coincidentally called the Three Barry\nSisters, though unrelated both to Barry and the more famous Barry Sisters duo\nin America.[9] The career breakthrough for Barry was the BBC television series\n_[Drumbeat](/wiki/Drumbeat_\\(TV_series\\) \"Drumbeat \\(TV series\\)\")_ , when he\nappeared with the John Barry Seven. He was employed by [EMI](/wiki/EMI \"EMI\")\nfrom 1959 until 1962 arranging orchestral accompaniment for the company's\nsingers, including [Adam Faith](/wiki/Adam_Faith \"Adam Faith\");[10] he also\ncomposed songs (along with [Les Vandyke](/wiki/Les_Vandyke \"Les Vandyke\")) and\nscores for films in which Faith was featured. When Faith made his first film,\n_[Beat Girl](/wiki/Beat_Girl \"Beat Girl\")_ (1960), Barry composed, arranged\nand conducted the score, his first. His music was later released as the UK's\nfirst soundtrack album.[11]\n\nBarry also composed the music for another Faith film, _[Never Let\nGo](/wiki/Never_Let_Go \"Never Let Go\")_ (also 1960), orchestrated the score\nfor _[Mix Me a Person](/wiki/Mix_Me_a_Person \"Mix Me a Person\")_ (1962), and\ncomposed, arranged and conducted the score for _[The Amorous\nPrawn](/wiki/The_Amorous_Prawn \"The Amorous Prawn\")_ (also 1962). In 1962,\nBarry transferred to [Ember Records](/wiki/Ember_Records_\\(UK_label\\) \"Ember\nRecords \\(UK label\\)\"), where he produced albums as well as arranging\nthem.[12]\n\nThese achievements caught the attention of the [producers](/wiki/Film_producer\n\"Film producer\") of a new film called _[Dr. No](/wiki/Dr._No_\\(film\\) \"Dr. No\n\\(film\\)\")_ (1962) who were dissatisfied with a theme for [James\nBond](/wiki/James_Bond \"James Bond\") given to them by [Monty\nNorman](/wiki/Monty_Norman \"Monty Norman\"). Barry was hired and the result was\none of the most famous signature tunes in film history, the \"[James Bond\nTheme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme \"James Bond Theme\")\". (Credit goes to Monty\nNorman, [see here](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme#Authorship_of_the_\"James_Bond_Theme\"\n\"James Bond Theme\").) When the producers of the Bond series engaged [Lionel\nBart](/wiki/Lionel_Bart \"Lionel Bart\") to score the next James Bond film\n_[From Russia with Love](/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_\\(film\\) \"From Russia\nwith Love \\(film\\)\")_ (1963), they discovered that Bart could neither read nor\nwrite music. Though Bart wrote a title song for the film, the producers\nremembered Barry's arrangement of the James Bond Theme and his composing and\narranging for several films with Adam Faith. Lionel Bart also recommended\nBarry to producer [Stanley Baker](/wiki/Stanley_Baker \"Stanley Baker\") for his\nfilm _[Zulu](/wiki/Zulu_\\(1964_film\\) \"Zulu \\(1964 film\\)\")_ (1964).[13] Bart\nand Barry worked together in the film _[Man in the\nMiddle](/wiki/Man_in_the_Middle_\\(film\\) \"Man in the Middle \\(film\\)\")_.\n\nThis was the turning point for Barry, and he subsequently won five [Academy\nAwards](/wiki/Academy_Awards \"Academy Awards\") and four [Grammy\nAwards](/wiki/Grammy_Award \"Grammy Award\"), with scores for, among others,\n_[Born Free](/wiki/Born_Free \"Born Free\")_ (1966), _[The Lion in\nWinter](/wiki/The_Lion_in_Winter_\\(1968_film\\) \"The Lion in Winter \\(1968\nfilm\\)\")_ (1968), _[Midnight Cowboy](/wiki/Midnight_Cowboy \"Midnight Cowboy\")_\n(1969) for which he did not receive an on-screen credit.[14] and _[Somewhere\nin Time](/wiki/Somewhere_in_Time_\\(film\\) \"Somewhere in Time \\(film\\)\")_\n(1980).[2]\n\nBarry was often cited as having had a distinct style which concentrated on\nlush strings and extensive use of brass. However he was also an innovator,\nbeing one of the first to employ synthesizers in a film score (_[On Her\nMajesty's Secret Service](/wiki/On_Her_Majesty%27s_Secret_Service_\\(film\\) \"On\nHer Majesty's Secret Service \\(film\\)\")_, also 1969),[15] and to make wide use\nof pop artists and songs in _Midnight Cowboy_.[16] Because Barry provided not\njust the main title theme but the complete soundtrack\n[score](/wiki/Sheet_music \"Sheet music\"), his music often enhanced the\ncritical reception of a film, notably in _Midnight Cowboy_ , the first remake\nof _[King Kong](/wiki/King_Kong_\\(1976_film\\) \"King Kong \\(1976 film\\)\")_\n(1976), _[Out of Africa](/wiki/Out_of_Africa_\\(film\\) \"Out of Africa\n\\(film\\)\")_ (1985), and _[Dances with Wolves](/wiki/Dances_with_Wolves \"Dances\nwith Wolves\")_ (1990). Barry would often watch films and would note down with\npen and paper what worked or what did not.[5]\n\nBarry composed the theme for the TV series _[The\nPersuaders!](/wiki/The_Persuaders! \"The Persuaders!\")_ (1971), also known as\n_The Unlucky Heroes_ , in which [Tony Curtis](/wiki/Tony_Curtis \"Tony Curtis\")\nand [Roger Moore](/wiki/Roger_Moore \"Roger Moore\") were paired as rich\nplayboys solving crimes.[17] The instrumental recording features the\n[Cimbalom](/wiki/Cimbalom \"Cimbalom\") (which Barry also used for _[The Ipcress\nFile](/wiki/The_Ipcress_File_\\(film\\) \"The Ipcress File \\(film\\)\")_ (1965) and\nother themes) and [Moog synthesizers](/wiki/Moog_synthesizer \"Moog\nsynthesizer\"). The theme was a hit single in many European countries\n(including France, Germany, and the Benelux states), contributing to the cult\nstatus of the series in Europe, and the record featured Barry's _The Girl with\nthe Sun in Her Hair_ on the B side, an instrumental piece featured in a long\nrunning TV advert for [Sunsilk](/wiki/Sunsilk \"Sunsilk\") shampoo. Barry also\nwrote the scores to a number of musicals, including the 1965 _[Passion Flower\nHotel](/wiki/Passion_Flower_Hotel \"Passion Flower Hotel\")_ (lyrics by [Trevor\nPeacock](/wiki/Trevor_Peacock \"Trevor Peacock\")), the successful 1974 West End\nshow _[Billy](/wiki/Billy_\\(musical\\) \"Billy \\(musical\\)\")_ (lyrics by [Don\nBlack](/wiki/Don_Black_\\(lyricist\\) \"Don Black \\(lyricist\\)\")),[18] and two\nmajor [Broadway](/wiki/Broadway_musical \"Broadway musical\") flops, _[Lolita,\nMy Love](/wiki/Lolita,_My_Love \"Lolita, My Love\")_ (1971), with [Alan Jay\nLerner](/wiki/Alan_Jay_Lerner \"Alan Jay Lerner\") as lyricist, and _[The Little\nPrince and the Aviator](/wiki/The_Little_Prince_and_the_Aviator \"The Little\nPrince and the Aviator\")_ (1981), again with lyricist Don Black.\n\nIn 2001, the [University of York](/wiki/University_of_York \"University of\nYork\") conferred an honorary degree on Barry, and in 2002 he was named an\nHonorary [Freeman](/wiki/Freedom_of_the_City \"Freedom of the City\") of the\nCity of York.[19][20]\n\nDuring 2006, Barry was the executive producer on an album entitled _Here 's to\nthe Heroes_ by the Australian ensemble [The Ten Tenors](/wiki/The_Ten_Tenors\n\"The Ten Tenors\"). The album features a number of songs Barry wrote in\ncollaboration with his lyricist friend, Don Black. Barry and Black also\ncomposed one of the songs on [Shirley Bassey](/wiki/Shirley_Bassey \"Shirley\nBassey\")'s 2009 album, _The Performance_. The song, entitled \"Our Time Is\nNow\", is the first written by the duo for Bassey since \"[Diamonds Are\nForever](/wiki/Diamonds_Are_Forever_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Diamonds Are Forever\n\\(soundtrack\\)\")\".[21]\n\n### _James Bond_\nseries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Barry_\\(composer\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: James Bond series\")]\n\nAfter the success of _Dr. No_ , Barry was hired to compose and perform eleven\nof the next fourteen _[James Bond](/wiki/James_Bond_in_film \"James Bond in\nfilm\")_ films ([Monty Norman](/wiki/Monty_Norman \"Monty Norman\") is legally\nrecognised as the composer of the \"[James Bond Theme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme\n\"James Bond Theme\")\").[22]\n\nIn his tenure with the film series, Barry's music, variously brassy and moody,\nachieved very wide appeal. For _From Russia with Love_ he composed \"007\", an\nalternative James Bond signature theme, which is featured in four other Bond\nfilms (_Thunderball_ , _You Only Live Twice_ , _Diamonds Are Forever_ and\n_Moonraker_). The theme \"Stalking\", for the teaser sequence of _From Russia\nwith Love_ , was covered by colleague [Marvin Hamlisch](/wiki/Marvin_Hamlisch\n\"Marvin Hamlisch\") for _[The Spy Who Loved\nMe](/wiki/The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_\\(film\\) \"The Spy Who Loved Me \\(film\\)\")_\n(1977). (The music and lyrics for _From Russia with Love '_s title song were\nwritten by [Lionel Bart](/wiki/Lionel_Bart \"Lionel Bart\"), whose musical\ntheatre credits included _Oliver!_) Barry also contributed indirectly to the\nsoundtrack of the spoof version of _[Casino\nRoyale](/wiki/Casino_Royale_\\(1967_film\\) \"Casino Royale \\(1967 film\\)\")_\n(1967): his _[Born Free](/wiki/Born_Free \"Born Free\")_ theme appears briefly\nin the opening sequence.\n\nIn _[Goldfinger](/wiki/Goldfinger_\\(film\\) \"Goldfinger \\(film\\)\")_ (1964), he\nperfected the \"Bond sound\", a heady mixture of brass, jazz elements and\nsensuous melodies. There is even an element of Barry's jazz roots in the big-\nband track \"Into Miami\", which follows the title credits and accompanies the\nfilm's iconic image of the camera lens zooming toward the Fontainebleau Hotel\nin [Miami Beach](/wiki/Miami_Beach \"Miami Beach\"). A side note is that [Jimmy\nPage](/wiki/Jimmy_Page \"Jimmy Page\"), worked as a session guitarist at the\ntime, and was a part of the recording sessions for the \"Goldfinger\"\nsoundtrack.[23] For Bond films, session musicians such as Page were relegated\nto the instrumental/score version of songs, while the main musicians (on\nGoldfinger: [Vic Flick](/wiki/Vic_Flick \"Vic Flick\")) were given the main film\ntheme song to record (featured at the beginning of the movie).[24] Leaving\nPage as a background acoustic contributor to Flick on the instrumental version\nof the song.\n\nBarry's love for the Russian romantic composers is often reflected in his\nmusic; in his Bond scores he unites this with brass-heavy jazz writing. His\nuse of strings, lyricism, half-diminished chords, and complex key shifting\nprovides melancholy contrast-often heard in variations of the title songs as\nintegrally infused with the plot development.[25]\n\nAs Barry matured, the Bond scores became more lushly melodic (along with other\nscores of his such as _[Out of Africa](/wiki/Out_of_Africa_\\(film\\) \"Out of\nAfrica \\(film\\)\")_), as in _[Moonraker](/wiki/Moonraker_\\(film\\) \"Moonraker\n\\(film\\)\")_ (1979) and _[Octopussy](/wiki/Octopussy \"Octopussy\")_ (1983).\nBarry's score for _A View to a Kill_ was traditional, but his collaboration\nwith [Duran Duran](/wiki/Duran_Duran \"Duran Duran\") for the [title\nsong](/wiki/A_View_to_a_Kill_\\(song\\) \"A View to a Kill \\(song\\)\") was\ncontemporary and reached number one in the United States and number two in the\n[UK Singles Chart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\"). Both _A View to\na Kill_ and _[The Living Daylights](/wiki/The_Living_Daylights_\\(soundtrack\\)\n\"The Living Daylights \\(soundtrack\\)\")_ theme by [a-ha](/wiki/A-ha \"A-ha\")\nblended the pop music style of the bands with Barry's orchestration. In 2006,\na-ha's [Pal Waaktaar](/wiki/Pal_Waaktaar \"Pal Waaktaar\") complimented Barry's\ncontributions: \"I loved the stuff he added to the track, I mean it gave it\nthis really cool string arrangement. That's when for me it started to sound\nlike a Bond thing.\"[26]\n\nBarry's last score for the Bond series was _[The Living\nDaylights](/wiki/The_Living_Daylights \"The Living Daylights\")_ (1987),\n[Timothy Dalton](/wiki/Timothy_Dalton \"Timothy Dalton\")'s first film in the\nseries with Barry making a cameo appearance as a conductor in the film.[27]\nBarry was intended to score _[Licence to Kill](/wiki/Licence_to_Kill \"Licence\nto Kill\")_ (1989) but was recovering from throat surgery at the time and it\nwas considered unsafe to fly him to London to complete the score. The score\nwas completed by [Michael Kamen](/wiki/Michael_Kamen \"Michael Kamen\").[28]\n\n[David Arnold](/wiki/David_Arnold \"David Arnold\"), a British composer, saw the\nresult of two years' work in 1997 with the release of _Shaken and Stirred: The\nDavid Arnold James Bond Project_ , an album of new versions of the themes from\nvarious James Bond films. Arnold thanks Barry in the sleeve notes, referring\nto him as \"the Guvnor\". Almost all of the tracks were John Barry compositions,\nand the revision of his work met with his approval – he contacted [Barbara\nBroccoli](/wiki/Barbara_Broccoli \"Barbara Broccoli\"), producer of the then\nupcoming _[Tomorrow Never Dies](/wiki/Tomorrow_Never_Dies \"Tomorrow Never\nDies\")_ , to recommend Arnold as the film's composer.[29] Arnold also went on\nto score four subsequent Bond films: _[The World Is Not\nEnough](/wiki/The_World_Is_Not_Enough \"The World Is Not Enough\")_ , _[Die\nAnother Day](/wiki/Die_Another_Day \"Die Another Day\")_ , _[Casino\nRoyale](/wiki/Casino_Royale_\\(2006_film\\) \"Casino Royale \\(2006 film\\)\")_ and\n_[Quantum of Solace](/wiki/Quantum_of_Solace \"Quantum of Solace\")_.\n\nSole compositional credit for the \"James Bond Theme\" is attributed to [Monty\nNorman](/wiki/Monty_Norman \"Monty Norman\"), who was contracted as composer for\n_Dr. No_. Some 30 years later, in 2001, the disputed authorship of the theme\nwas examined legally in the High Court in London after Norman sued _[The\nSunday Times](/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_\\(UK\\) \"The Sunday Times \\(UK\\)\")_ for\npublishing an article in 1997 in which Barry was named as the true composer;\nBarry testified for the defence.[30][31]\n\nIn court, Barry testified that he had been handed a musical manuscript of a\nwork by Norman (meant to become the theme) and that he was to arrange it\nmusically, and that he composed additional music and arranged the \"James Bond\nTheme\". The court was also told that Norman received sole credit because of\nhis prior contract with the producers. Barry said that a deal was struck\nwhereby he would receive a flat fee of £250 and Norman would receive the\nsongwriting credit.[32] Barry said that he had accepted the deal with United\nArtists Head of Music Noel Rogers because it would help his career. Despite\nthese claims the jury ruled unanimously in favour of Norman.[32]\n\nOn 7 September 2006, John Barry publicly defended his authorship of the theme\non the [Steve Wright](/wiki/Steve_Wright_\\(DJ\\) \"Steve Wright \\(DJ\\)\") show on\n[BBC Radio 2](/wiki/BBC_Radio_2 \"BBC Radio 2\").[33]\n\n### Personal life and\ndeath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Barry_\\(composer\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Personal life and death\")]\n\nBarry was married four times. His first three marriages, to Barbara Pickard\n(1959–63), [Jane Birkin](/wiki/Jane_Birkin \"Jane Birkin\") (1965–68), and Jane\nSidey (1969–78) all ended in divorce.[7] He was married to his fourth wife,\nLaurie, from January 1978[7] until his death. The couple had a son,\nJonpatrick. Barry had three daughters, Suzanne (Susie) with his first wife,\nBarbara, [Kate](/wiki/Kate_Barry_\\(photographer\\) \"Kate Barry\n\\(photographer\\)\") with his second wife, Jane, and Sian from a relationship\nwith Ulla Larson between the first two marriages.[4] Suzy Barry, who is\nmarried to BBC business journalist [Simon Jack](/wiki/Simon_Jack \"Simon\nJack\"), is the mother of his two granddaughters, Phoebe and Florence Ingleby.\n\nIn 1975 Barry moved to California. A British judge later accused him of\nemigrating to avoid paying [£](/wiki/Pound_sterling \"Pound sterling\")134,000\ndue the [Inland Revenue](/wiki/Inland_Revenue \"Inland Revenue\").[7] The matter\nwas resolved in the late 1980s and Barry was able to return to the UK.[7] He\nsubsequently lived for many years in the United States, mainly in [Oyster\nBay](/wiki/Oyster_Bay_\\(hamlet\\),_New_York \"Oyster Bay \\(hamlet\\), New York\"),\nNew York, in [Centre Island](/wiki/Centre_Island,_New_York \"Centre Island, New\nYork\") on [Long Island](/wiki/Long_Island \"Long Island\"), from 1980.[4][34]\n\nBarry suffered a [rupture of the oesophagus](/wiki/Boerhaave_syndrome\n\"Boerhaave syndrome\") in 1988, following a toxic reaction to a health tonic he\nhad consumed. The incident rendered him unable to work for two years and left\nhim vulnerable to [pneumonia](/wiki/Pneumonia \"Pneumonia\").[35]\n\nBarry died of a heart attack on 30 January 2011 at his Oyster Bay home, aged\n77.[36][37]\n\nA memorial concert took place on 20 June 2011 at the [Royal Albert\nHall](/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall \"Royal Albert Hall\") in London where the [Royal\nPhilharmonic
