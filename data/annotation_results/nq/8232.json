Whitfield first produced the\nsong – an obvious [anti-Vietnam War](/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Vietnam_War\n\"Opposition to the Vietnam War\") protest – with [The\nTemptations](/wiki/The_Temptations \"The Temptations\") as the original\nvocalists. After Motown began receiving repeated requests to release \"War\" as\na single, Whitfield re-recorded the song with [Edwin Starr](/wiki/Edwin_Starr\n\"Edwin Starr\") as the vocalist, with the label deciding to withhold the\nTemptations' version from single release so as not to alienate their more\nconservative fans. Starr's version of \"War\" was a number-one hit on the\n[_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") chart in\n1970, and is not only the most successful and well-known record of his career,\nbut it is also one of the most popular [protest songs](/wiki/Protest_song\n\"Protest song\") ever recorded. It was one of 161 songs on the [Clear Channel\nno-play list](/wiki/2001_Clear_Channel_memorandum \"2001 Clear Channel\nmemorandum\") after September 11, 2001.[1]\n\nThe song's power was reasserted when [Bruce\nSpringsteen](/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen \"Bruce Springsteen\") and the E Street\nBand took their rendition into the U.S. Top 10 in 1986. It was also covered by\n[Frankie Goes to Hollywood](/wiki/Frankie_Goes_to_Hollywood \"Frankie Goes to\nHollywood\") in 1984 and more recently by the [Rock](/wiki/Rock_music \"Rock\nmusic\") band [Black Stone Cherry](/wiki/Black_Stone_Cherry \"Black Stone\nCherry\") on its 2016 album\n_[Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky_\\(Black_Stone_Cherry_album\\) \"Kentucky \\(Black\nStone Cherry album\\)\")_.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Temptations' version and release debate\n  * 2 Edwin Starr version\n    * 2.1 Chart position\n  * 3 Frankie Goes to Hollywood version\n  * 4 Bruce Springsteen version\n    * 4.1 Charts\n  * 5 Personnel\n    * 5.1 Edwin Starr version\n    * 5.2 Temptations version\n    * 5.3 Frankie Goes to Hollywood version\n    * 5.4 Bruce Springsteen version\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Temptations' version and release\ndebate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_\\(The_Temptations_song\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Temptations' version and release debate\")]\n\nThe Temptations' version of \"War\", featuring [Paul\nWilliams](/wiki/Paul_Williams_\\(The_Temptations\\) \"Paul Williams \\(The\nTemptations\\)\") and [Dennis Edwards](/wiki/Dennis_Edwards \"Dennis Edwards\") on\nlead vocals, was much less intense than the Edwin Starr version. Williams and\nEdwards deliver the song's anti-war, pro-peace message over a stripped-down\ninstrumental track, with [bass singer](/wiki/Bass_\\(voice_type\\) \"Bass \\(voice\ntype\\)\") [Melvin Franklin](/wiki/Melvin_Franklin \"Melvin Franklin\") chanting a\nrepeated [recruit training](/wiki/Recruit_training \"Recruit training\")-like\n\"hup, two, three, four\" in the background during the verses.\n\nThe song was included as a track on the March 1970 _[Psychedelic\nShack](/wiki/Psychedelic_Shack_\\(album\\) \"Psychedelic Shack \\(album\\)\")_\nalbum, which featured the [title track](/wiki/Psychedelic_Shack_\\(song\\)\n\"Psychedelic Shack \\(song\\)\") as its only single. The track's direct message,\nsummarized by its chorus (\"War, what is it good for? Absolutely nothin'!\"),\nstruck a chord with the American public and resonated with growing public\nopposition to the war in Vietnam. Fans from across the nation, many of them\ncollege students and other young people, sent letters to Motown requesting the\nrelease of \"War\" as a single. The label did not want to risk the image of its\nmost popular male group, and the Temptations themselves were also apprehensive\nabout releasing such a potentially controversial song as a single. The label\ndecided to withhold \"War\"'s release as a single, a decision that Whitfield\nfought until the label came up with a compromise: \"War\" would be released, but\nit would have to be re-recorded with a different act.\n\n## Edwin Starr\nversion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_\\(The_Temptations_song\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Edwin Starr version\")]\n\n\"War\"  \n---  \n[![Edwin-starr-war-\nsingle-1970.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/19/Edwin-starr-\nwar-single-1970.jpg/220px-Edwin-starr-war-single-1970.jpg)](/wiki/File:Edwin-\nstarr-war-single-1970.jpg)  \n[Single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\") by [Edwin\nStarr](/wiki/Edwin_Starr \"Edwin Starr\")  \nfrom the album _[War& Peace](/wiki/War_%26_Peace_\\(Edwin_Starr_album\\) \"War &\nPeace \\(Edwin Starr album\\)\")_  \n[B-side](/wiki/A-side_and_B-side \"A-side and B-side\")|  \"He Who Picks a Rose\"  \nReleased|  June 10, 1970 (1970-06-10)  \nFormat|  [7-inch single](/wiki/7-inch_single \"7-inch single\")  \nRecorded|  May 15, 1970  \n[Studio](/wiki/Recording_studio \"Recording studio\")|  [Hitsville\nUSA](/wiki/Hitsville_USA \"Hitsville USA\") (Studio A), Detroit, Michigan  \n[Genre](/wiki/Music_genre \"Music genre\")|  [Psychedelic\nsoul](/wiki/Psychedelic_soul \"Psychedelic soul\"), [funk](/wiki/Funk \"Funk\")  \nLength|  3:48  \n[Label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\")|  [Gordy](/wiki/Motown \"Motown\")\n(Gordy 7101)  \n[Songwriter(s)](/wiki/Songwriter \"Songwriter\")|  [Norman\nWhitfield](/wiki/Norman_Whitfield \"Norman Whitfield\"), [Barrett\nStrong](/wiki/Barrett_Strong \"Barrett Strong\")  \n[Producer(s)](/wiki/Record_producer \"Record producer\")|  Norman Whitfield  \n[Edwin Starr](/wiki/Edwin_Starr \"Edwin Starr\") singles chronology  \n| \"Time\"  \n(1970)  | \"**War** \"   \n(1970)  | \"Stop the War Now\"   \n(1970)  \n---|---|---  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png) |  [Edwin Starr sings _War_](/wiki/File:Edwin_Starr_-_War.ogg \"File:Edwin Starr - War.ogg\") ![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkqAcAAIUAgUW0RjgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)[](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/Edwin_Starr_-_War.ogg) Sample of the song  \n---|---  \n  \n* * *\n\n_Problems playing this file?

Considered among Motown's \"second-string\" acts, Starr had only\none major hit, 1968's number-six hit \"Twenty-Five Miles\", to his name by this\ntime. He heard about the conflict surrounding the debate of whether or not to\nrelease \"War\", and volunteered to re-record it. Whitfield re-created the song\nto match Starr's [James Brown](/wiki/James_Brown_\\(musician\\) \"James Brown\n\\(musician\\)\")-influenced soul shout: the single version of \"War\" was dramatic\nand intense, depicting the general anger and distaste the [antiwar\nmovement](/wiki/Antiwar_movement \"Antiwar movement\") felt towards the war in\nVietnam. Unlike the Temptations' original, Starr's \"War\" was a full-scale\nWhitfield production, with prominent [electric guitar](/wiki/Electric_guitar\n\"Electric guitar\") lines, [clavinets](/wiki/Clavinet \"Clavinet\"), a heavily\nsyncopated rhythm accented by a [horn section](/wiki/Horn_section \"Horn\nsection\"), and with [The Originals](/wiki/The_Originals_\\(band\\) \"The\nOriginals \\(band\\)\") and Whitfield's new act [The Undisputed\nTruth](/wiki/The_Undisputed_Truth \"The Undisputed Truth\") on backing vocals.\n\nUpon its release in June 1970, Starr's \"War\" became a runaway hit, and held\nthe #1 position on the _[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_magazine \"Billboard\nmagazine\")_ Pop Singles chart for three weeks, in August and September 1970.\nIt replaced \"Make It With You\" by [Bread](/wiki/Bread_\\(band\\) \"Bread\n\\(band\\)\"), and was replaced by another Motown single, \"[Ain't No Mountain\nHigh Enough](/wiki/Ain%27t_No_Mountain_High_Enough \"Ain't No Mountain High\nEnough\")\" by [Diana Ross](/wiki/Diana_Ross \"Diana Ross\"). _Billboard_ ranked\nit as the [No. 5 song of 1970](/wiki/Billboard_Year-\nEnd_Hot_100_singles_of_1970 \"Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1970\").\n\nNotable as the most successful protest song to become a pop hit, earning\ncompliments from contemporary protester John Lennon, \"War\" became Edwin\nStarr's signature song. Rather than hindering his career (as it might have\ndone for the Temptations), \"War\" buoyed Starr's career, and he adopted the\nimage of an outspoken [liberal](/wiki/Liberalism \"Liberalism\") orator for many\nof his other early-1970s releases, including the similarly themed \"Stop the\nWar Now\" from 1971. It and another 1971 single, \"[Funky Music Sho' 'Nuff Turns\nMe On](/wiki/Funky_Music_Sho%27_%27Nuff_Turns_Me_On \"Funky Music Sho' 'Nuff\nTurns Me On\")\", continued Starr's string of Whitfield-produced psychedelic\nsoul hits. After 1971, Starr's career began to falter, and, citing Motown's\nreliance on formulas, he departed the label in the mid-1970s.\n\nLater in his career, after moving to the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom\n\"United Kingdom\"), Starr re-recorded several of his hits with British band\n[Utah Saints](/wiki/Utah_Saints \"Utah Saints\"). Starr's new version of \"War\"\nin 2003 was his final piece. He died on April 2 of the same year of a [heart\nattack](/wiki/Myocardial_infarction \"Myocardial infarction\").\n\nStarr earned a [Grammy](/wiki/Grammy \"Grammy\") nomination in 1971 for \"War\"\nfor best R&B Male Vocal.[2] In 1999, Starr's recording of the song was\ninducted into the [Grammy Hall of Fame](/wiki/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame \"Grammy Hall\nof Fame\").\n\n\"War\" was featured in the films _[Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination\nLondon](/wiki/Agent_Cody_Banks_2:_Destination_London \"Agent Cody Banks 2:\nDestination London\")_ , _[Gulliver's\nTravels](/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels_\\(2010_film\\) \"Gulliver's Travels \\(2010\nfilm\\)\")_, _[Small Soldiers](/wiki/Small_Soldiers \"Small Soldiers\")_ as well\nas its [soundtrack](/wiki/Small_Soldiers_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Small Soldiers\n\\(soundtrack\\)\"), _[Rush Hour](/wiki/Rush_Hour_\\(1998_film\\) \"Rush Hour \\(1998\nfilm\\)\")_ , _[Rush Hour 3](/wiki/Rush_Hour_3 \"Rush Hour 3\")_ , and _[Teenage\nMutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the\nShadows](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Out_of_the_Shadows \"Teenage\nMutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows\")_ , and in the TV spot to _[Tropic\nThunder](/wiki/Tropic_Thunder \"Tropic Thunder\")_.\n\nThe song is featured in _[The Simpsons](/wiki/The_Simpsons \"The Simpsons\")_\nepisode \"[Treehouse of Horror VIII](/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VIII \"Treehouse\nof Horror VIII\"),\" in the segment \"The Homega Man\". After Springfield is\nattacked by a French nuclear weapon, [Homer](/wiki/Homer_Simpson \"Homer\nSimpson\"), seemingly the only person in the city not killed or mutated by the\nexplosion, is seen dancing completely naked to the song in a church.\n\nThe song was sung by Stewie Griffin in _[Family Guy](/wiki/Family_Guy \"Family\nGuy\")_ episode \"[Bigfat](/wiki/Bigfat \"Bigfat\")\" when he was helping Peter\nsing while grunting at the rhythm.\n\nStarr's version of \"War\" is featured in a [2015](/wiki/2015_in_television\n\"2015 in television\") [TV commercial](/wiki/TV_commercial \"TV commercial\") for\nthe [Nissan Rogue](/wiki/Nissan_Rogue \"Nissan Rogue\").\n\nA truncated version of Starr's original recording was used as the opening\ntheme to the TV drama _[Family Law](/wiki/Family_Law_\\(TV_series\\) \"Family Law\n\\(TV series\\)\")_ (1999 – 2002).\n\nThe song was referenced in the _[Seinfeld](/wiki/Seinfeld \"Seinfeld\")_ episode\n\"[The Marine Biologist](/wiki/The_Marine_Biologist \"The Marine Biologist\")\"\nwhere Jerry convinces Elaine that Tolstoy's original title for \"[War and\nPeace](/wiki/War_and_Peace \"War and Peace\")\" was \"War, What Is It Good For?\"\n\n### Chart\nposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_\\(The_Temptations_song\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Chart position\")]\n\nChart  | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nBelgium ([Ultratop 50](/wiki/Ultratop \"Ultratop\") Flanders)[3] | 16   \nCanada ([_RPM_ 100 Singles](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\"))[4] | 1   \nGermany ([Official German Charts](/wiki/GfK_Entertainment_Charts \"GfK Entertainment Charts\"))[5] | 9  \nIreland ([IRMA](/wiki/Irish_Recorded_Music_Association \"Irish Recorded Music Association\"))[6] | 5   \nNetherlands ([Single Top 100](/wiki/Single_Top_100 \"Single Top 100\"))[7] | 14   \nNorway ([VG-lista](/wiki/VG-lista \"VG-lista\"))[8] | 9   \n[UK Singles](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\") (Official Charts Company)[9] | 3  \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[10] | 1   \n  \n## Frankie Goes to Hollywood\nversion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_\\(The_Temptations_song\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Frankie Goes to Hollywood version\")]\n\n\"War\"  \n---  \n[![Frankie Goes to Hollywood War 12\" Single Cover\n1984.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/Frankie_Goes_to_Hollywood_War_12%22_Single_Cover_1984.jpg/220px-\nFrankie_Goes_to_Hollywood_War_12%22_Single_Cover_1984.jpg)](/wiki/File:Frankie_Goes_to_Hollywood_War_12%22_Single_Cover_1984.jpg)  \n[Single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\") by [Frankie Goes to\nHollywood](/wiki/Frankie_Goes_to_Hollywood \"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\")  \nfrom the album _[Welcome to the\nPleasuredome](/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Pleasuredome \"Welcome to the\nPleasuredome\")_  \n[B-side](/wiki/A-side_and_B-side \"A-side and B-side\")|\n\n  * \"Two Tribes (Carnage)\"\n  * “One February Friday”\n\n  \nReleased|  July 9, 1984  \nFormat|  [12-inch single](/wiki/12-inch_single \"12-inch single\")  \n[Genre](/wiki/Music_genre \"Music genre\")|\n\n  * [Hi-NRG](/wiki/Hi-NRG \"Hi-NRG\")\n  * [dance](/wiki/Dance_music \"Dance music\")\n  * [synthpop](/wiki/Synthpop \"Synthpop\")\n  * [new wave](/wiki/New_wave \"New wave\")\n\n  \nLength|  8:33  \n[Label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\")|  [ZTT](/wiki/ZTT_Records \"ZTT\nRecords\") (WARTZ 3)  \n[Songwriter(s)](/wiki/Songwriter \"Songwriter\")|\n\n  * [Norman Whitfield](/wiki/Norman_Whitfield \"Norman Whitfield\")\n  * [Barrett Strong](/wiki/Barrett_Strong \"Barrett Strong\")\n\n  \n[Producer(s)](/wiki/Record_producer \"Record producer\")|  [Trevor\nHorn](/wiki/Trevor_Horn \"Trevor Horn\")  \n[Frankie Goes to Hollywood](/wiki/Frankie_Goes_to_Hollywood \"Frankie Goes to\nHollywood\") singles chronology  \n| \"[Relax](/wiki/Relax_\\(song\\) \"Relax \\(song\\)\")\"  \n(1983)  | \"**War** \"   \n(1984)  | \"[The Power of Love](/wiki/The_Power_of_Love_\\(Frankie_Goes_to_Hollywood_song\\) \"The Power of Love \\(Frankie Goes to Hollywood song\\)\")\"   \n(1984)  \n---|---|---  \n  \n[Frankie Goes to Hollywood](/wiki/Frankie_Goes_to_Hollywood \"Frankie Goes to\nHollywood\") followed their debut 1983 UK number one single\n[Relax](/wiki/Relax_\\(song\\) \"Relax \\(song\\)\") with [Two\nTribes](/wiki/Two_Tribes \"Two Tribes\"). The principal B-side for 12-inch\nsingle was a cover version of \"War\". To build on the chart success of “Two\nTribes”, “War” became the subject of an accomplished extended remix in its own\nright (subtitled \"Hidden\") for the third version of single's UK 12-inch. For\nthe release “War” was promoted as a double-A-side with the \"Carnage” mix of\n“Two Tribes” on the reverse. The 12-inch double-A-side single was released in\nstandard and picture disc versions, both with the ZTT Records catalog number\nWARTZ 3.\n\nVersions of both “Two Tribes” and “War” would later appear on the group’s 1984\ndebut album _[Welcome to the Pleasuredome](/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Pleasuredome\n\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\")_ as well as numerous Frankie Goes to Hollywoood\nand ZTT Records compilation albums.\n\nThe release of “War” / \"Two Tribes\" also coincided with an extensive and\niconic t-shirt marketing campaign for the band during the summer of 1984,\nfeaturing such slogans as \"Frankie Say WAR! Hide Yourself\", as pictured on the\n12\" single cover.\n\nSeveral lines of spoken dialogue were added to the Temptations/Edwin Starr\nversion of the song.

A year earlier, he had suggested the same, as a loose protest against\n[Reagan Administration](/wiki/Reagan_Administration \"Reagan Administration\")\nforeign policy in Central America and elsewhere, but the band had been unable\nto come up with an effective arrangement. This time, however, they did.\nSpringsteen taped the words of the song to his arm, prefaced the song with a\nspoken admonition not to blindly trust the government, leaders or anything\nelse, and then he and the band performed a rock rendition.\n\nSpringsteen released the September 30, 1985 performance as a part of his 1986\nbox set, _[Live/1975–85](/wiki/Live/1975%E2%80%9385 \"Live/1975–85\")_. \"War\"\nwas chosen as the first single from the set, and it was again a big hit,\nreaching #8 on the [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard\nHot 100\") chart.
