        "# Connecticut Compromise\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThis article is about the agreement sometimes referred to as the Great\nCompromise. For the song by [John Prine](/wiki/John_Prine \"John Prine\"), see\n[The Great Compromise (song)](/wiki/The_Great_Compromise_\\(song\\) \"The Great\nCompromise \\(song\\)\").\n\nThe **Connecticut Compromise** (also known as the **Great Compromise of 1787**\nor **Sherman Compromise**) was an agreement that both large and small states\nreached during the [Constitutional\nConvention](/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_\\(United_States\\) \"Constitutional\nConvention \\(United States\\)\") of 1787 that in part defined the legislative\nstructure and representation that each state would have under the [United\nStates Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States\nConstitution\"). It retained the [bicameral\nlegislature](/wiki/Bicameral_legislature \"Bicameral legislature\") as proposed\nby [Roger Sherman](/wiki/Roger_Sherman \"Roger Sherman\"), along with\nproportional representation of the states in the lower house, but required the\nupper house to be weighted equally between the states. Each state would have\ntwo representatives in the [upper house](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United\nStates Senate\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Context\n  * 2 The Compromise\n  * 3 Aftermath\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n##\nContext[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Connecticut_Compromise&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Context\")]\n\nOn May 29, 1787, [Edmund Randolph](/wiki/Edmund_Randolph \"Edmund Randolph\") of\nthe [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\") delegation proposed the creation of\na [bicameral legislature](/wiki/Bicameral_legislature \"Bicameral\nlegislature\"). Under his proposal, membership in both houses would be\nallocated to each state proportional to its population; however, candidates\nfor the lower house would be nominated and elected by the people of each\nstate. This proposal allowed fairness and equality to the people. Candidates\nfor the upper house would be nominated by the state legislatures of each state\nand then elected by the members of the lower house. This proposal was known as\nthe [Virginia Plan](/wiki/Virginia_Plan \"Virginia Plan\").\n\nLess populous states like [Delaware](/wiki/Delaware \"Delaware\") were afraid\nthat such an arrangement would result in their voices and interests being\ndrowned out by the larger states. Many delegates also felt that the Convention\ndid not have the authority to completely scrap the [Articles of\nConfederation](/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation \"Articles of\nConfederation\"),[1] as the Virginia Plan would have.[2] In response, on June\n15, 1787, [William Paterson](/wiki/William_Paterson_\\(judge\\) \"William\nPaterson \\(judge\\)\") of the [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey \"New Jersey\")\ndelegation proposed a legislature consisting of a single house. Each state was\nto have equal representation in this body, regardless of population. The [New\nJersey Plan](/wiki/New_Jersey_Plan \"New Jersey Plan\"), as it was called, would\nhave left the Articles of Confederation in place, but would have amended them\nto somewhat increase [Congress](/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation \"Congress\nof the Confederation\")'s powers.[3]\n\nAt the time of the convention, the South was growing more quickly than the\nNorth, and Southern states had the most extensive [Western\nclaims](/wiki/State_cessions \"State cessions\"). [South\nCarolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\"), [North\nCarolina](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North Carolina\"), and\n[Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_\\(U.S._state\\) \"Georgia \\(U.S. state\\)\") were small in\nthe 1780s, but they expected growth, and thus favored proportional\nrepresentation. New York was one of the largest states at the time, but two of\nits three representatives ([Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton\n\"Alexander Hamilton\") being the exception) supported an equal representation\nper state, as part of their desire to see maximum autonomy for the states.\n(The two representatives other than Hamilton had left the convention before\nthe representation issue was resolved, leaving Hamilton, and New York state,\nwithout a vote.)\n\n[James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\") and Hamilton were two of\nthe leaders of the proportional representation group. Madison argued that a\nconspiracy of large states against the small states was unrealistic as the\nlarge states were so different from each other. Hamilton argued that the\nstates were artificial entities made up of individuals, and accused small\nstate representatives of wanting power, not liberty (see [History of the\nUnited States Senate](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Senate \"History of\nthe United States Senate\")).\n\nFor their part, the small state representatives argued that the states were,\nin fact, of a legally equal status, and that proportional representation would\nbe unfair to their states. [Gunning Bedford, Jr.](/wiki/Gunning_Bedford,_Jr.\n\"Gunning Bedford, Jr.\") of [Delaware](/wiki/Delaware \"Delaware\") notoriously\nthreatened on behalf of the small states, \"the small ones w[ould] find some\nforeign ally of more honor and good faith, who will take them by the hand and\ndo them justice.\"\n\n[Elbridge Gerry](/wiki/Elbridge_Gerry \"Elbridge Gerry\") ridiculed the small\nstates’ claim of sovereignty, saying “that we never were independent States,\nwere not such now, & never could be even on the principles of the\nConfederation. The States & the advocates for them were intoxicated with the\nidea of their sovereignty.”[4]\n\n## The\nCompromise[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Connecticut_Compromise&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: The Compromise\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png) |  This section may **require[cleanup](/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup \"Wikipedia:Cleanup\")** to meet Wikipedia's [quality standards](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style\").

The request was granted, and, on the next day, Paterson submitted nine\nresolutions embodying necessary amendments to the Articles of Confederation,\nwhich was followed by a vigorous debate. On June 19, the delegates rejected\nthe [New Jersey Plan](/wiki/New_Jersey_Plan \"New Jersey Plan\") and voted to\nproceed with a discussion of the Virginia Plan. The small States became\nincreasingly discontented, and some threatened to withdraw. On July 2, the\nConvention was deadlocked over giving each State an equal vote in the upper\nhouse, with five States in the affirmative, five in the negative, and one\ndivided.\n\nThe problem was referred to a committee consisting of one delegate from each\nState to reach a compromise. On July 5, the committee submitted its report,\nwhich became the basis for the “Great Compromise\" of the Convention. The\nreport recommended that in the upper house each State should have an equal\nvote and in the lower house, each State should have one representative for\nevery 40,000 inhabitants,[5] counting slaves as three-fifths of an\ninhabitant,[5] and that money bills should originate in the lower house (not\nsubject to amendment by the upper chamber).\n\nAfter six weeks of turmoil, [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North\nCarolina\") switched its vote to equal representation per state and\n[Massachusetts](/wiki/Massachusetts \"Massachusetts\") abstained, and a\ncompromise was reached, being called the \"Great Compromise.\" In the \"Great\nCompromise,\" every state was given equal representation, previously known as\nthe [New Jersey Plan](/wiki/New_Jersey_Plan \"New Jersey Plan\"), in one house\nof Congress, and proportional representation, known before as the [Virginia\nPlan](/wiki/Virginia_Plan \"Virginia Plan\"), in the other. Because it was\nconsidered more responsive to majority sentiment, the House of Representatives\nwas given the power to originate all legislation dealing with the federal\nbudget and revenues/taxation, per the [Origination\nClause](/wiki/Origination_Clause \"Origination Clause\").\n\n[Roger Sherman](/wiki/Roger_Sherman \"Roger Sherman\") and [Oliver\nEllsworth](/wiki/Oliver_Ellsworth \"Oliver Ellsworth\"), both of the\n[Connecticut](/wiki/Connecticut \"Connecticut\") delegation, created a\ncompromise that, in a sense, blended the Virginia (large-state) and New Jersey\n(small-state) proposals regarding congressional apportionment. Ultimately,\nhowever, its main contribution was in determining the apportionment of the\nSenate. Sherman sided with the two-house national legislature of the Virginia\nPlan but proposed \"That the proportion of suffrage in the 1st. Branch [house]\nshould be according to the respective numbers of free inhabitants; and that in\nthe second branch or Senate, each State should have one vote and no more.\"[6]\nAlthough Sherman was well liked and respected among the delegates, his plan\nfailed at first. It was not until July 23 that representation was finally\nsettled.[6]\n\nWhat was ultimately included in the constitution was a modified form of this\nplan, partly because the larger states disliked it. In committee, [Benjamin\nFranklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin Franklin\") modified Sherman's\nproposal to make it more acceptable to the larger states. He added the\nrequirement that revenue bills originate in the house.\n\nThe final July 16 vote on the Connecticut Compromise left the Senate looking\nto the Confederation Congress. In the preceding weeks of debate, Madison,\nKing, and Gouverneur Morris each vigorously opposed the compromise for this\nreason.[7] For the nationalists, the Convention’s vote for the compromise was\na stunning defeat. However, on July 23, they found a way to salvage their\nvision of an elite, independent Senate. Just before most of the convention’s\nwork was referred to the Committee of Detail, Morris and King moved that state\nrepresentatives in the Senate be given individual votes, rather than voting en\nbloc, as they had in the Confederation Congress. Then Oliver Ellsworth, a\nleading proponent of the Connecticut Compromise, supported their motion, and\nthe Convention adopted it.[8] As the Convention had early acquiesced in the\nVirginia Plan’s proposal that senators have long terms, restoring that Plan’s\nvision of individually powerful senators stopped the Senate from becoming a\nstrong safeguard of federalism. State governments lost their direct say in\nCongress’s decisions to make national laws. As the personally influential\nsenators received terms much longer than the state legislators who appointed\nthem, they became substantially independent. The compromise nonetheless\ncontinued to serve the self-interest of small-state political leaders, who\nwere assured of access to more seats in the Senate than they might otherwise\nhave obtained.[9]\n\n##\nAftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Connecticut_Compromise&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\nSenate representation was explicitly protected in [Article Five of the United\nStates Constitution](/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Article Five of the United States Constitution\"):\n\n> ...no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in\n> the Senate.[10]\n\nThis agreement allowed deliberations to continue and thus led to the [Three-\nFifths Compromise](/wiki/Three-fifths_compromise \"Three-fifths compromise\"),\nwhich further complicated the issue of popular representation in the House.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Connecticut_Compromise&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [History of the United States Senate](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Senate \"History of the United States Senate\")\n  * [Constitutional Convention](/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_\\(United_States\\) \"Constitutional Convention \\(United States\\)\")\n  * [Virginia Plan](/wiki/Virginia_Plan \"Virginia Plan\")\n  * [New Jersey Plan](/wiki/New_Jersey_Plan \"New Jersey Plan\")\n  * [Three-Fifths Compromise](/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise \"Three-Fifths Compromise\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Connecticut_Compromise&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Madison's notes, June 16 1787\"](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_616.asp).
