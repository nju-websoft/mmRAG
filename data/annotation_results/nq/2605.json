The [orbit](/wiki/Orbit \"Orbit\") of a planet is an [ellipse](/wiki/Ellipse \"Ellipse\") with the Sun at one of the two [foci](/wiki/Focus_\\(geometry\\) \"Focus \\(geometry\\)\").\n  2. A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.[1]\n  3. The square of the [orbital period](/wiki/Orbital_period \"Orbital period\") of a planet is proportional to the cube of the [semi-major axis](/wiki/Semi-major_axis \"Semi-major axis\") of its orbit.\n\nMost planetary orbits are nearly circular, and careful observation and\ncalculation are required in order to establish that they are not perfectly\ncircular. Calculations of the orbit of [Mars](/wiki/Mars \"Mars\"), whose\npublished values are somewhat suspect,[2] indicated an elliptical orbit. From\nthis, [Johannes Kepler](/wiki/Johannes_Kepler \"Johannes Kepler\") inferred that\nother bodies in the [Solar System](/wiki/Solar_System \"Solar System\"),\nincluding those farther away from the Sun, also have elliptical orbits.\n\nKepler's work (published between 1609 and 1619) improved the [heliocentric\ntheory](/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism \"Copernican heliocentrism\") of\n[Nicolaus Copernicus](/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus \"Nicolaus Copernicus\"),\nexplaining how the planets' speeds varied, and using elliptical orbits rather\nthan circular orbits with [epicycles](/wiki/Epicycle \"Epicycle\").[3]\n\n[Isaac Newton](/wiki/Isaac_Newton \"Isaac Newton\") showed in 1687 that\nrelationships like Kepler's would apply in the Solar System to a good\napproximation, as a consequence of his own [laws of\nmotion](/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion \"Newton's laws of motion\") and [law of\nuniversal gravitation](/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation \"Newton's\nlaw of universal gravitation\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Comparison to Copernicus\n  * 2 Nomenclature\n  * 3 History\n  * 4 Formulary\n    * 4.1 First law\n    * 4.2 Second law\n    * 4.3 Third law Of Kepler's\n  * 5 Planetary acceleration\n    * 5.1 Acceleration vector\n    * 5.2 The inverse square law\n    * 5.3 Newton's law of gravitation\n  * 6 Position as a function of time\n    * 6.1 Mean anomaly, _M_\n    * 6.2 Eccentric anomaly, _E_\n    * 6.3 True anomaly, _θ_\n    * 6.4 Distance, _r_\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 Bibliography\n  * 11 External links\n\n## Comparison to\nCopernicus[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Comparison to Copernicus\")]\n\nKepler's laws improve the model of Copernicus. If the\n[eccentricities](/wiki/Eccentricity_\\(mathematics\\) \"Eccentricity\n\\(mathematics\\)\") of the planetary [orbits](/wiki/Orbit \"Orbit\") are taken as\nzero, then Kepler basically agrees with Copernicus:\n\n  1. The planetary orbit is a circle\n  2. The Sun is at the center of the orbit\n  3. The speed of the planet in the orbit is constant\n\nThe eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to Copernicus and\nKepler are small, so the foregoing rules give good approximations of planetary\nmotion; but Kepler's laws fit the observations better than Copernicus'.\n\nKepler's corrections are not at all obvious:\n\n  1. The planetary orbit is _not_ a circle, but an _ellipse_.\n  2. The Sun is _not_ at the center but at a _focal point_ of the elliptical orbit.\n  3. Neither the linear speed nor the angular speed of the planet in the orbit is constant, but the _area speed_ is constant.\n\nThe eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the [March\nequinox](/wiki/March_equinox \"March equinox\") to the [September\nequinox](/wiki/September_equinox \"September equinox\"), around 186 days,\nunequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around\n179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane\nthrough the Sun parallel to the [equator](/wiki/Equator \"Equator\") of the\nEarth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the\neccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately\n\n     ε ≈ π 4 186 − 179 186 + 179 ≈ 0.015 , {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon \\approx {\\frac {\\pi }{4}}{\\frac {186-179}{186+179}}\\approx 0.015,} ![\\\\varepsilon\\\\approx\\\\frac \\\\pi 4 \\\\frac {186-179}{186+179}\\\\approx 0.015,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a3f5cfe712b7cb596487a366e11c39d2da914f5)\n\nwhich is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see [Earth's\norbit](/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit \"Earth's orbit\")). The calculation is correct\nwhen [perihelion](/wiki/Perihelion \"Perihelion\"), the date the Earth is\nclosest to the Sun, falls on a [solstice](/wiki/Solstice \"Solstice\"). The\ncurrent perihelion, near January 4, is fairly close to the solstice of\nDecember 21 or 22.\n\n##\nNomenclature[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Nomenclature\")]\n\nIt took nearly two centuries for the current formulation of Kepler's work to\ntake on its settled form. [Voltaire](/wiki/Voltaire \"Voltaire\")'s _Eléments de\nla philosophie de Newton_ (Elements of Newton's Philosophy) of 1738 was the\nfirst publication to use the terminology of \"laws\".[4][5] The _[Biographical\nEncyclopedia of Astronomers](/wiki/Biographical_Encyclopedia_of_Astronomers\n\"Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers\")_ in its article on Kepler (p. 620)\nstates that the terminology of scientific laws for these discoveries was\ncurrent at least from the time of [Joseph de Lalande](/wiki/Joseph_de_Lalande\n\"Joseph de Lalande\").[6] It was the exposition of [Robert\nSmall](/wiki/Robert_Small_\\(minister\\) \"Robert Small \\(minister\\)\"), in _An\naccount of the astronomical discoveries of Kepler_ (1804) that made up the set\nof three laws, by adding in the third.[7] Small also claimed, against the\nhistory, that these were [empirical laws](/wiki/Empirical_law \"Empirical\nlaw\"), based on [inductive reasoning](/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive\nreasoning\").[5][8]\n\nFurther, the current usage of \"Kepler's Second Law\" is something of a\nmisnomer. Kepler had two versions, related in a qualitative sense: the\n\"distance law\" and the \"area law.\" The \"area law\" is what became the Second\nLaw in the set of three; but Kepler did himself not privilege it in that\nway.[9]\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[Johannes Kepler](/wiki/Johannes_Kepler \"Johannes Kepler\") published his first\ntwo laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the\nastronomical observations of [Tycho Brahe](/wiki/Tycho_Brahe \"Tycho\nBrahe\").[10][3][11] Kepler's third law was published in 1619.[12][3] Notably,\nKepler had believed in the [Copernican model](/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism\n\"Copernican heliocentrism\") of the solar system, which called for circular\norbits, but could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a\ncircular fit to Mars' orbit (Mars coincidentally having the highest\neccentricity of all planets except Mercury[13]). His first law reflected this\ndiscovery.\n\nKepler in 1621 and [Godefroy Wendelin](/wiki/Godefroy_Wendelin \"Godefroy\nWendelin\") in 1643 noted that Kepler's third law applies to the four brightest\nmoons of [Jupiter](/wiki/Jupiter \"Jupiter\").[Nb 1] The second law, in the\n\"area law\" form, was contested by [Nicolaus Mercator](/wiki/Nicolaus_Mercator\n\"Nicolaus Mercator\") in a book from 1664, but by 1670 his _[Philosophical\nTransactions](/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions \"Philosophical Transactions\")_\nwere in its favour. As the century proceeded it became more widely\naccepted.[14] The reception in Germany changed noticeably between 1688, the\nyear in which Newton's\n_[Principia](/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica\n\"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\")_ was published and was taken to\nbe basically Copernican, and 1690, by which time work of [Gottfried\nLeibniz](/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz \"Gottfried Leibniz\") on Kepler had been\npublished.[15]\n\nNewton is credited with understanding that the second law is not special to\nthe inverse square law of gravitation, being a consequence just of the radial\nnature of that law; while the other laws do depend on the inverse square form\nof the attraction. [Carl Runge](/wiki/Carl_Runge \"Carl Runge\") and [Wilhelm\nLenz](/wiki/Wilhelm_Lenz \"Wilhelm Lenz\") much later identified a symmetry\nprinciple in the [phase space](/wiki/Phase_space \"Phase space\") of planetary\nmotion (the [orthogonal group](/wiki/Orthogonal_group \"Orthogonal group\") O(4)\nacting) which accounts for the first and third laws in the case of Newtonian\ngravitation, as [conservation of angular\nmomentum](/wiki/Conservation_of_angular_momentum \"Conservation of angular\nmomentum\") does via rotational symmetry for the second law.[16]\n\n##\nFormulary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Formulary\")]\n\nThe mathematical model of the kinematics of a planet subject to the laws\nallows a large range of further calculations.\n\n### First\nlaw[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: First law\")]\n\n> The [orbit](/wiki/Orbit \"Orbit\") of every [planet](/wiki/Planet \"Planet\") is\n> an [ellipse](/wiki/Ellipse \"Ellipse\") with the Sun at one of the two\n> [foci](/wiki/Focus_\\(geometry\\) \"Focus \\(geometry\\)\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Kepler-first-\nlaw.svg/220px-Kepler-first-law.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Kepler-first-law.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kepler-first-law.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFigure 2: Kepler's first law placing the Sun at the focus of an elliptical\norbit\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Ellipse_latus_rectum.svg/220px-\nEllipse_latus_rectum.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Ellipse_latus_rectum.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ellipse_latus_rectum.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFigure 4: Heliocentric coordinate system (_r_ , _θ_) for ellipse.

Here _P_ is the time taken for a planet to\ncomplete an orbit round the sun, and _a_ is the mean value between the maximum\nand minimum distances between the planet and sun.\n\nThe corresponding formula in Newtonian mechanics is\n\n     P 2 a 3 = 4 π 2 G ( M + m ) ≈ 4 π 2 G M = c o n s t a n t {\\displaystyle {\\frac {P^{2}}{a^{3}}}={\\frac {4\\pi ^{2}}{G(M+m)}}\\approx {\\frac {4\\pi ^{2}}{GM}}=\\mathrm {constant} } ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {P^{2}}{a^{3}}}={\\\\frac {4\\\\pi ^{2}}{G\\(M+m\\)}}\\\\approx {\\\\frac {4\\\\pi ^{2}}{GM}}=\\\\mathrm {constant} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/55e5d2ffe23a3f1c37e116fa99e54e1c4d906d3c)\n\nwhere _M_ is the mass of the sun, _m_ is the mass of the planet, and _G_ is\nthe [gravitational constant](/wiki/Gravitational_constant \"Gravitational\nconstant\").\n\nAs the Sun is much more massive than any planet, Kepler's third law is\napproximately correct in Newtonian mechanics.\n\n## Planetary\nacceleration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Planetary acceleration\")]\n\n[Isaac Newton](/wiki/Isaac_Newton \"Isaac Newton\") computed in his\n_[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia\nMathematica](/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica\n\"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\")_ the\n[acceleration](/wiki/Acceleration \"Acceleration\") of a planet moving according\nto Kepler's first and second law.\n\n  1. The _direction_ of the acceleration is towards the Sun.\n  2. The _magnitude_ of the acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's distance from the Sun (the _inverse square law_).\n\nThis implies that the Sun may be the physical cause of the acceleration of\nplanets. However, Newton states in his Principia that he considers forces from\na mathematical point of view, not a physical, thereby taking an\ninstrumentalist view.[19] Moreover, he does not assign a cause to gravity.[20]\n\nNewton defined the [force](/wiki/Force \"Force\") acting on a planet to be the\nproduct of its [mass](/wiki/Mass \"Mass\") and the acceleration (see [Newton's\nlaws of motion](/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion \"Newton's laws of motion\")).\nSo:\n\n  1. Every planet is attracted towards the Sun.\n  2. The force acting on a planet is in direct proportion to the mass of the planet and in inverse proportion to the square of its distance from the Sun.\n\nThe Sun plays an unsymmetrical part, which is unjustified. So he assumed, in\n[Newton's law of universal\ngravitation](/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation \"Newton's law of\nuniversal gravitation\"):\n\n  1. All bodies in the solar system attract one another.\n  2. The force between two bodies is in direct proportion to the product of their masses and in inverse proportion to the square of the distance between them.\n\nAs the planets have small masses compared to that of the Sun, the orbits\nconform approximately to Kepler's laws. Newton's model improves upon Kepler's\nmodel, and fits actual observations more accurately (see [two-body\nproblem](/wiki/Two-body_problem \"Two-body problem\")).\n\nBelow comes the detailed calculation of the acceleration of a planet moving\naccording to Kepler's first and second laws.\n\n### Acceleration\nvector[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Acceleration vector\")]\n\nSee also: [Polar coordinate § Vector\ncalculus](/wiki/Polar_coordinate#Vector_calculus \"Polar coordinate\"), and\n[Mechanics of planar particle\nmotion](/wiki/Mechanics_of_planar_particle_motion \"Mechanics of planar\nparticle motion\")\n\nFrom the [heliocentric](/wiki/Heliocentric \"Heliocentric\") point of view\nconsider the vector to the planet  r = r r ^ {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {r}\n=r{\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}} ![\\\\mathbf{r} = r \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}\n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/176a26a6b258c7b8eba91c67303e748f6705ec4d)\nwhere  r {\\displaystyle r} ![\nr](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538)\nis the distance to the planet and  r ^ {\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}}\n![ \\\\hat {\\\\mathbf{r}}\n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9740464b71653e12932278ee944540be8caa5b96)\nis a [unit vector](/wiki/Unit_vector \"Unit vector\") pointing towards the\nplanet.\n\n     d r ^ d t = r ^ ˙ = θ ˙ θ ^ , d θ ^ d t = θ ^ ˙ = − θ ˙ r ^ {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d{\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}}{dt}}={\\dot {\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}}={\\dot {\\theta }}{\\hat {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}},\\qquad {\\frac {d{\\hat {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}}}{dt}}={\\dot {\\hat {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}}}=-{\\dot {\\theta }}{\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}} ![ \\\\frac{d\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}}{dt}=\\\\dot{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}} = \\\\dot\\\\theta  \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta},\\\\qquad  \\\\frac{d\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta}}{dt}=\\\\dot{\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta}} = -\\\\dot\\\\theta \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/67868cd7b29b9b314709e3f7c5cd08aeec2a95ad)\n\nwhere  θ ^ {\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}}}\n![\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca32f6d693b0a183a7728b875f7e2042bb1dbca2)\nis the unit vector whose direction is 90 degrees counterclockwise of  r ^\n{\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}} ![{\\\\hat {\\\\mathbf {r}\n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9740464b71653e12932278ee944540be8caa5b96),\nand  θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } ![\\\\theta\n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af)\nis the polar angle, and where a\n[dot](/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation#Newton.27s_notation \"Notation for\ndifferentiation\") on top of the variable signifies differentiation with\nrespect to time.\n\nDifferentiate the position vector twice to obtain the velocity vector and the\nacceleration vector:\n\n     r ˙ = r ˙ r ^ + r r ^ ˙ = r ˙ r ^ + r θ ˙ θ ^ , {\\displaystyle {\\dot {\\mathbf {r} }}={\\dot {r}}{\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}+r{\\dot {\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}}={\\dot {r}}{\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}+r{\\dot {\\theta }}{\\hat {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}},} ![\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{r}} =\\\\dot{r} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}} + r \\\\dot{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}}\n=\\\\dot{r} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}} + r \\\\dot{\\\\theta}\n\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}},](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f0552fa9f1e302b97d73115aab352e9e03d53dd0)\n\n     r ¨ = ( r ¨ r ^ + r ˙ r ^ ˙ ) + ( r ˙ θ ˙ θ ^ + r θ ¨ θ ^ + r θ ˙ θ ^ ˙ ) = ( r ¨ − r θ ˙ 2 ) r ^ + ( r θ ¨ + 2 r ˙ θ ˙ ) θ ^ . {\\displaystyle {\\ddot {\\mathbf {r} }}=({\\ddot {r}}{\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}+{\\dot {r}}{\\dot {\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}})+({\\dot {r}}{\\dot {\\theta }}{\\hat {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}}+r{\\ddot {\\theta }}{\\hat {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}}+r{\\dot {\\theta }}{\\dot {\\hat {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}}})=({\\ddot {r}}-r{\\dot {\\theta }}^{2}){\\hat {\\mathbf {r} }}+(r{\\ddot {\\theta }}+2{\\dot {r}}{\\dot {\\theta }}){\\hat {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}}.} ![\\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{r}} \n= \\(\\\\ddot{r} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}} +\\\\dot{r} \\\\dot{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}} \\)\n\n+ \\(\\\\dot{r}\\\\dot{\\\\theta} \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}} + r\\\\ddot{\\\\theta} \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}}\n+ r\\\\dot{\\\\theta} \\\\dot{\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}}}\\)\n= \\(\\\\ddot{r} -

From the top of page 285: _\" Ergo ellipsis est\nPlanetæ iter; … \"_ (Thus, an ellipse is the planet's [i.e., Mars'] path; … )\nLater on the same page: _\" … ut sequenti capite patescet: ubi simul etiam\ndemonstrabitur, nullam Planetæ relinqui figuram Orbitæ, præterquam perfecte\nellipticam; … \"_ ( … as will be revealed in the next chapter: where it will\nalso then be proved that any figure of the planet's orbit must be\nrelinquished, except a perfect ellipse; … ) And then: _\" Caput LIX.\nDemonstratio, quod orbita Martis, … , fiat perfecta ellipsis: … \"_ (Chapter\n59. Proof that Mars' orbit, … , is a perfect ellipse: … ) The geometric proof\nthat Mars' orbit is an ellipse appears as Protheorema XI on pages 289–290.  \nKepler stated that every planet travels in elliptical orbits having the Sun at\none focus in: Johannes Kepler, _Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae_ [Summary of\nCopernican Astronomy] (Linz (\"Lentiis ad Danubium\"), (Austria): Johann Planck,\n1622), book 5, part 1, III. De Figura Orbitæ (III.

From p. 659: _\" … Sole (Foco altero huius ellipsis) … \"_ (\n… the Sun (the other focus of this ellipse) … ).\n\n  11. **Jump up ^** In his _Astronomia nova_ ... (1609), Kepler did not present his second law in its modern form. He did that only in his _Epitome_ of 1621. Furthermore, in 1609, he presented his second law in two different forms, which scholars call the \"distance law\" and the \"area law\".\n     * His \"distance law\" is presented in: _\" Caput XXXII. Virtutem quam Planetam movet in circulum attenuari cum discessu a fonte.\"_ (Chapter 32. The force that moves a planet circularly weakens with distance from the source.) See: Johannes Kepler, _Astronomia nova_ … (1609), [pp. 165–167.](https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/164/mode/2up) [On page 167](https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/166/mode/2up), Kepler states: _\" … , quanto longior est αδ quam αε, tanto diutius moratur Planeta in certo aliquo arcui excentrici apud δ, quam in æquali arcu excentrici apud ε.\"_ ( … , as αδ is longer than αε, so much longer will a planet remain on a certain arc of the eccentric near δ than on an equal arc of the eccentric near ε.) That is, the farther a planet is from the Sun (at the point α), the slower it moves along its orbit, so a radius from the Sun to a planet passes through equal areas in equal times. However, as Kepler presented it, his argument is accurate only for circles, not ellipses.\n     * His \"area law\" is presented in: _\" Caput LIX. Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, … , fiat perfecta ellipsis: … \"_ (Chapter 59. Proof that Mars' orbit, … , is a perfect ellipse: … ), Protheorema XIV and XV, [pp. 291–295.](https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/284/mode/2up) On the top p. 294, it reads: _\" Arcum ellipseos, cujus moras metitur area AKN, debere terminari in LK, ut sit AM.\"_ (The arc of the ellipse, of which the duration is delimited [i.e., measured] by the area AKM, should be terminated in LK, so that it [i.e., the arc] is AM.) In other words, the time that Mars requires to move along an arc AM of its elliptical orbit is measured by the area of the segment AMN of the ellipse (where N is the position of the Sun), which in turn is proportional to the section AKN of the circle that encircles the ellipse and that is tangent to it. Therefore, the area that is swept out by a radius from the Sun to Mars as Mars moves along an arc of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the time that Mars requires to move along that arc. Thus, a radius from the Sun to Mars sweeps out equal areas in equal times.\nIn 1621, Kepler restated his second law for any planet: Johannes Kepler,\n_Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae_ [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz\n(\"Lentiis ad Danubium\"), (Austria): Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, [page\n668](https://books.google.com/books?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg=PA668#v=onepage&q&f=true).\nFrom page 668: _\" Dictum quidem est in superioribus, divisa orbita in\nparticulas minutissimas æquales: accrescete iis moras planetæ per eas, in\nproportione intervallorum inter eas & Solem.\"_ (It has been said above that,\nif the orbit of the planet is divided into the smallest equal parts, the times\nof the planet in them increase in the ratio of the distances between them and\nthe sun.) That is, a planet's speed along its orbit is inversely proportional\nto its distance from the Sun. (The remainder of the paragraph makes clear that\nKepler was referring to what is now called angular velocity.)\n\n  12. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Johannes Kepler, _Harmonices Mundi_ [The Harmony of the World] (Linz, (Austria): Johann Planck, 1619), book 5, chapter 3, [p. 189.](https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLlCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false) From the bottom of p. 189: _\" Sed res est certissima exactissimaque quod_ proportio qua est inter binorum quorumcunque Planetarum tempora periodica, sit præcise sesquialtera proportionis _mediarum distantiarum, … \"_ (But it is absolutely certain and exact that the _proportion between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely the sesquialternate proportion_ [i.e., the ratio of 3:2] of their mean distances, … \")  \nAn English translation of Kepler's _Harmonices Mundi_ is available as:\nJohannes Kepler with E.J.
