It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from\nancient [Byzantium](/wiki/Byzantium \"Byzantium\") as the new capital of the\nRoman Empire by Emperor [Constantine the Great](/wiki/Constantine_the_Great\n\"Constantine the Great\"), after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330\nAD.[5]\n\nFrom the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the\nlargest and wealthiest city in Europe[6] and it was instrumental in the\nadvancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times as the home of\nthe [Ecumenical Patriarch of\nConstantinople](/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_of_Constantinople \"Ecumenical\nPatriarch of Constantinople\") and as the guardian of Christendom's holiest\nrelics such as the [Crown of Thorns](/wiki/Crown_of_thorns \"Crown of thorns\")\nand the [True Cross](/wiki/True_Cross \"True Cross\"). After the final loss of\nits provinces in the early 15th century, the Byzantine Empire was reduced to\njust Constantinople and its environs, along with [Morea](/wiki/Morea \"Morea\")\nin Greece, and the city [eventually fell](/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople \"Fall\nof Constantinople\") to the Ottomans after a month-long siege in 1453.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Bizansist_touchup.jpg/300px-\nBizansist_touchup.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bizansist_touchup.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bizansist_touchup.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAerial view of Byzantine Constantinople and the Propontis (Sea of Marmara)\n\nConstantinople was famed for its massive and complex defences. Although\nbesieged on numerous occasions by various peoples, the defences of\nConstantinople proved invulnerable for nearly nine hundred years before the\ncity was taken in 1204 by the Crusader armies of the [Fourth\nCrusade](/wiki/Fourth_Crusade \"Fourth Crusade\"), and after it was liberated in\n1261 by the Byzantine Emperor [Michael VIII\nPalaiologos](/wiki/Michael_VIII_Palaiologos \"Michael VIII Palaiologos\"), a\nsecond and final time in 1453 when it was conquered by the Ottoman\n[Sultan](/wiki/Sultan \"Sultan\") [Mehmed II](/wiki/Mehmed_II \"Mehmed II\"). The\nfirst wall of the city was erected by [Constantine I](/wiki/Constantine_I\n\"Constantine I\"), and surrounded the city on both land and sea fronts. Later,\nin the 5th century, the [Praetorian Prefect](/wiki/Praetorian_prefect\n\"Praetorian prefect\") [Anthemius](/wiki/Anthemius_\\(praetorian_prefect\\)\n\"Anthemius \\(praetorian prefect\\)\") under the child emperor [Theodosius\nII](/wiki/Theodosius_II \"Theodosius II\") undertook the construction of the\n[Theodosian Walls](/wiki/Theodosian_Walls \"Theodosian Walls\"), which consisted\nof a double wall lying about 2 km (1.2 miles) to the west of the first wall\nand a moat with palisades in front.[7] This formidable complex of defences was\none of the most sophisticated of\n[Antiquity](/w/index.php?title=Classical_antiquity.&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Classical antiquity. \\(page does not exist\\)\"). The city was built\nintentionally to rival Rome, and it was claimed that several elevations within\nits walls matched the 'seven hills' of Rome. Because it was located between\nthe [Golden Horn](/wiki/Golden_Horn \"Golden Horn\") and the [Sea of\nMarmara](/wiki/Sea_of_Marmara \"Sea of Marmara\") the land area that needed\ndefensive walls was reduced, and this helped it to present an impregnable\nfortress enclosing magnificent palaces, domes, and towers, the result of the\nprosperity that was engendered by its being the gateway between two\n[continents](/wiki/Continent \"Continent\") (Europe and Asia) and two seas (the\nMediterranean and the Black Sea).\n\nThe city was also famed for its architectural masterpieces, such as the [Greek\nOrthodox](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church \"Eastern Orthodox Church\") cathedral\nof [Hagia Sophia](/wiki/Hagia_Sophia \"Hagia Sophia\"), which served as the seat\nof the [Ecumenical\nPatriarchate](/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarchate_of_Constantinople \"Ecumenical\nPatriarchate of Constantinople\"), the sacred [Imperial\nPalace](/wiki/Great_Palace_of_Constantinople \"Great Palace of Constantinople\")\nwhere the Emperors lived, the [Galata Tower](/wiki/Galata_Tower \"Galata\nTower\"), the [Hippodrome](/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople \"Hippodrome of\nConstantinople\"), the [Golden Gate](/wiki/Golden_Gate_\\(Constantinople\\)\n\"Golden Gate \\(Constantinople\\)\") of the Land Walls, and the opulent\naristocratic palaces lining the arcaded avenues and squares. The [University\nof Constantinople](/wiki/University_of_Constantinople \"University of\nConstantinople\") was founded in the fifth century and contained numerous\nartistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453,[8]\nincluding its vast [Imperial Library](/wiki/Imperial_Library_of_Constantinople\n\"Imperial Library of Constantinople\") which contained the remnants of the\n[Library of Alexandria](/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria \"Library of Alexandria\")\nand had over 100,000 volumes of ancient texts.[9]\n\nConstantinople never truly recovered from the devastation of the Fourth\nCrusade and the decades of misrule by the Latins. Although the city partially\nrecovered in the early years after the restoration under the\n[Palaiologos](/wiki/Palaiologos \"Palaiologos\") dynasty, the advent of the\nOttomans and the subsequent loss of the Imperial territories until it became\nan enclave inside the fledgling Ottoman Empire rendered the city severely\ndepopulated when it fell to the Ottoman Turks,[10] whereafter it replaced\n[Edirne](/wiki/Edirne \"Edirne\") (Adrianople) as the new capital of the Ottoman\nEmpire.[11]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Names\n    * 1.1 Before Constantinople\n    * 1.2 Names of Constantinople\n    * 1.3 Modern names of the city\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 c. 657 BC–324 AD: Byzantium and earlier settlements\n    * 2.2 324–337: Foundation of Constantinople\n    * 2.3 337–529: Constantinople during the Migration Period\n    * 2.4 527–565: Constantinople in the Age of Justinian\n    * 2.5 Survival, 565–717: Constantinople during the Byzantine Dark Ages\n    * 2.6 717–1025: Constantinople during the Macedonian Renaissance\n      * 2.6.1 Iconoclast controversy in Constantinople\n    * 2.7 1025–1081: Constantinople after Basil II\n    * 2.8 1081–1185: Constantinople under the Comneni\n    * 2.9 1185–1261: Constantinople during the Imperial Exile\n    * 2.10 1261–1453: Palaiologan Era and the Fall of Constantinople\n    * 2.11 1453–1922: Ottoman Kostantiniyye\n  * 3 Importance\n    * 3.1 Culture\n    * 3.2 International status\n    * 3.3 Architecture\n    * 3.4 Religion\n    * 3.5 Popular culture\n  * 4 See also\n    * 4.1 People from Constantinople\n    * 4.2 Secular buildings and monuments\n    * 4.3 Churches, monasteries and mosques\n    * 4.4 Miscellaneous\n  * 5 Notes\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 Further reading\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Names[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Names\")]\n\n### Before\nConstantinople[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Before Constantinople\")]\n\nAccording to [Pliny the Elder](/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder \"Pliny the Elder\") in his\n_[Natural History](/wiki/Natural_History_\\(Pliny\\) \"Natural History\n\\(Pliny\\)\")_ , the first known name of a settlement on the site of\nConstantinople was _Lygos,_[12] a settlement of likely Thracian origin founded\nbetween the 13th and 11th century BC.[13] The site, according to the founding\nmyth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state\nof [Megara](/wiki/Megara \"Megara\") founded _[Byzantium](/wiki/Byzantium\n\"Byzantium\")_ ([Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\"): Βυζάντιον,\n_Byzántion_) in around 657 BC,[14] across from the town of\n[Chalcedon](/wiki/Chalcedon \"Chalcedon\") on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\n\nThe origins of the name of _[Byzantion](/wiki/Byzantium \"Byzantium\")_ , more\ncommonly known by the later Latin _Byzantium,_ are not entirely clear, though\nsome suggest it is of Thraco-[Illyrian](/wiki/Illyria \"Illyria\")\norigin.[15][16] The founding myth of the city has it told that the settlement\nwas named after the leader of the Megarian colonists, Byzas. The later\nByzantines of Constantinople themselves would maintain that the city was named\nin honour of two men, Byzas and Antes, though this was more likely just a play\non the word [Byzantion](/wiki/Byzantium \"Byzantium\").[17]\n\nThe city was briefly renamed _Augusta Antonina_ in the early 3rd century by\nthe Emperor [Septimius Severus](/wiki/Septimius_Severus \"Septimius Severus\")\n(193–211), having razed the city to the ground in 196 AD for supporting a\n[rival contender](/wiki/Pescennius_Niger \"Pescennius Niger\") in the [civil\nwar](/wiki/Year_of_the_Five_Emperors \"Year of the Five Emperors\") and rebuilt,\nin honour of his son Antoninus, the later Emperor [Caracalla](/wiki/Caracalla\n\"Caracalla\").[18][19] The name appears to have been quickly forgotten and\nabandoned, and the city reverted to Byzantium/Byzantion after either the\nassassination of Caracalla in 217 or, at the latest, the fall of the [Severan\ndynasty](/wiki/Severan_dynasty \"Severan dynasty\") in 235.\n\n### Names of\nConstantinople[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Names of Constantinople\")]\n\nMain article: [Names of Constantinople](/wiki/Names_of_Constantinople \"Names\nof Constantinople\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Keystone_Constantine_Forum_Istanbul.JPG/220px-\nKeystone_Constantine_Forum_Istanbul.JPG)](/wiki/File:Keystone_Constantine_Forum_Istanbul.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Keystone_Constantine_Forum_Istanbul.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThis huge [keystone](/wiki/Keystone_\\(architecture\\) \"Keystone\n\\(architecture\\)\") found in [Çemberlitaş,\nFatih](/wiki/%C3%87emberlita%C5%9F,_Fatih \"Çemberlitaş, Fatih\") may have\nbelonged to a [triumphal arch](/wiki/Triumphal_arch \"Triumphal arch\") at the\n[Forum of Constantine](/wiki/Forum_of_Constantine \"Forum of Constantine\"); the\nforum was built by [Constantine I](/wiki/Constantine_I \"Constantine I\") in the\nquarter of modern-day Çemberlitaş.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Column_of_Constantine%2C_July_2010.jpg/220px-\nColumn_of_Constantine%2C_July_2010.jpg)](/wiki/File:Column_of_Constantine,_July_2010.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Column_of_Constantine,_July_2010.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Column of Constantine](/wiki/Column_of_Constantine \"Column of\nConstantine\"), built by [Constantine I](/wiki/Constantine_I \"Constantine I\")\nin 330 AD to commemorate the establishment of Constantinople as the [new\ncapital](/wiki/New_Rome \"New Rome\") of the [Roman Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire\n\"Roman Empire\")\n\nByzantium took on the name of _Konstantinoupolis_ (\"city of Constantine\",\n_Constantinople_) after its re-foundation under Roman emperor [Constantine\nI](/wiki/Constantine_I \"Constantine I\"), who transferred the capital of the\n[Roman Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman Empire\") from [Rome](/wiki/Rome\n\"Rome\") to Byzantium in 330 AD and designated his new capital officially as\n_[Nova Roma](/wiki/New_Rome \"New Rome\")_ (Νέα Ῥώμη) 'New Rome'. During this\ntime, the city was also called 'Second Rome', 'Eastern Rome', and _Roma\nConstantinopolitana._[20] As the city became the sole remaining capital of the\nRoman Empire after the fall of the West, and its wealth, population, and\ninfluence grew, the city also came to have a multitude of nicknames.\n\nAs the largest and wealthiest city in Europe during the 4th–13th centuries and\na centre of culture and education of the Mediterranean basin, Constantinople\ncame to be known by prestigious titles such as _Basileuousa_ (Queen of Cities)\nand _Megalopolis_ (the Great City) and was, in colloquial speech, commonly\nreferred to as just _Polis_ (η πόλη) 'the City' by Constantinopolitans and\nprovincial Byzantines alike.[21]\n\nIn the language of other peoples, Constantinople was referred to just as\nreverently. The medieval Vikings, who had contacts with the empire through\ntheir expansion in eastern Europe ([Varangians](/wiki/Varangians\n\"Varangians\")) used the Old Norse name _Miklagarðr_ (from _mikill_ 'big' and\n_garðr_ 'city'), and later _Miklagard_ and _Miklagarth_. In Arabic, the city\nwas sometimes called _Rūmiyyat al-kubra_ (Great City of the Romans) and in\nPersian as _Takht-e Rum_ (Throne of the Romans).\n\nIn East and South Slavic languages, including in [medieval\nRussia](/wiki/Kievan_Rus%27 \"Kievan Rus'\"), Constantinople was referred to as\n_[Tsargrad](/wiki/Tsargrad \"Tsargrad\")_ (_Царьград_) or _Carigrad,_ 'City of\nthe Caesar (Emperor)', from the Slavonic words _tsar_ ('Caesar' or 'King') and\n_grad_ ('city'). This was presumably a [calque](/wiki/Calque \"Calque\") on a\nGreek phrase such as Βασιλέως Πόλις _(Vasileos Polis),_ 'the city of the\nemperor [king]'.\n\n### Modern names of the\ncity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Modern names of the city\")]\n\nThe modern Turkish name for the city, _[İstanbul](/wiki/%C4%B0stanbul\n\"İstanbul\")_ , derives from the [Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\")\nphrase _eis tin polin_ (εἰς τὴν πόλιν), meaning \"into the city\" or \"to the\ncity\".[22] This name was used in [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_language \"Turkish\nlanguage\") alongside _Kostantiniyye_ , the more formal adaptation of the\noriginal _Constantinople_ , during the period of\n[Ottoman](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman Empire\") rule, while western languages\nmostly continued to refer to the city as Constantinople until the early 20th\ncentury. In 1928, [the Turkish alphabet was\nchanged](/wiki/Turkish_Language_Commission \"Turkish Language Commission\") from\nArabic script to Latin script. After that, as part of the 1920s\n[Turkification](/wiki/Turkification \"Turkification\") movement, Turkey started\nto urge other countries to use [Turkish names for Turkish\ncities](/wiki/Geographical_name_changes_in_Turkey \"Geographical name changes\nin Turkey\"), instead of other transliterations to Latin script that had been\nused in the Ottoman times.[23][24][25][26] In time the city came to be known\nas Istanbul and its variations in most world languages.\n\nThe name \"Constantinople\" is still used by members of the [Eastern Orthodox\nChurch](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church \"Eastern Orthodox Church\") in the title\nof one of their most important leaders, the Orthodox\n[patriarch](/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_of_Constantinople \"Ecumenical Patriarch\nof Constantinople\") based in the city, referred to as \"His Most Divine All-\nHoliness the Archbishop of Constantinople New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch.\"\nIn Greece today, the city is still called Konstantinoúpolis/Konstantinoúpoli\n(Κωνσταντινούπολη/Κωνσταντινούπολις) or simply just \"the City\" (Η Πόλη / Η\nΠόλις).\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### c. 657 BC–324 AD: Byzantium and earlier\nsettlements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: c. 657 BC–324 AD: Byzantium and earlier settlements\")]\n\nMain article: [Byzantium](/wiki/Byzantium \"Byzantium\")\n\nConstantinople was founded by the [Roman Emperor](/wiki/Roman_Emperor \"Roman\nEmperor\") [Constantine I](/wiki/Constantine_I \"Constantine I\") (272–337 AD) in\n324[5] on the site of an already-existing city, [Byzantium](/wiki/Byzantium\n\"Byzantium\"), which was settled in the early days of [Greek colonial\nexpansion](/wiki/Greek_colonies \"Greek colonies\"), in around 657 BC, by\ncolonists of the city-state of [Megara](/wiki/Megara \"Megara\"). This is the\nfirst major settlement that would develop on the site of later Constantinople,\nbut the first known settlements was that of _Lygos_ , referred to in Pliny's\nNatural Histories,[27] Apart from this, little is known about this initial\nsettlement, except that it was abandoned by the time the Megarian colonists\nsettled the site anew. The site, according to the founding myth of the city,\nwas abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded\nByzantium (Greek: Βυζάντιον, Byzántion) in around 657 BC,[14] across from the\ntown of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\n\nThe city maintained independence as a city-state until it was annexed by\n[Darius I](/wiki/Darius_I \"Darius I\") in 512 BC into the [Persian\nEmpire](/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire \"Achaemenid Empire\"), who saw the site as the\noptimal location to construct a [pontoon bridge](/wiki/Pontoon_bridge \"Pontoon\nbridge\") crossing into Europe as Byzantium was situated at the narrowest point\nin the Bosphorus strait. Persian rule lasted until 478 BC when as part of the\nGreek counterattack to the [Second Persian Invasion of\nGreece](/wiki/Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece \"Second Persian invasion of\nGreece\"), a Greek army led by the Spartan general\n[Pausanias](/wiki/Pausanias_\\(general\\) \"Pausanias \\(general\\)\") captured the\ncity which remained an independent, yet subordinate, city under the Athenians,\nand later to the Spartans after 411 BC.[28] A farsighted treaty with the\nemergent power of Rome in c.150 BC which stipulated tribute in exchange for\nindependent status allowed it to enter Roman rule unscathed.[29] This treaty\nwould pay dividends retrospectively as Byzantium would maintain this\nindependent status, and prosper under peace and stability in the [Pax\nRomana](/wiki/Pax_Romana \"Pax Romana\"), for nearly three centuries until the\nlate 2nd century AD.[30]\n\nByzantium was never a major influential city-state like that of Athens,\nCorinth, and Sparta, but the city enjoyed relative peace and steady growth as\na prosperous trading city lent by its remarkable position.

Having restored the unity of\nthe Empire, and, being in the course of major governmental reforms as well as\nof [sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian\nchurch](/wiki/Constantine_I_and_Christianity \"Constantine I and\nChristianity\"), he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital.\nRome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the\nimperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected\npoliticians. Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand\nyears, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be\nmoved to a different location. Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site\nof Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily\ndefended, with easy access to the [Danube](/wiki/Danube \"Danube\") or the\n[Euphrates](/wiki/Euphrates \"Euphrates\") frontiers, his court supplied from\nthe rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries\nfilled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.\n\nConstantinople was built over 6 years, and consecrated on 11 May 330.[5][33]\nConstantine divided the expanded city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and\nornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis.[34] Yet, at\nfirst, Constantine's new Rome did not have all the dignities of old Rome. It\npossessed a [proconsul](/wiki/Proconsul \"Proconsul\"), rather than an [urban\nprefect](/wiki/Urban_prefect \"Urban prefect\"). It had no\n[praetors](/wiki/Praetors \"Praetors\"), [tribunes](/wiki/Tribunes \"Tribunes\"),\nor [quaestors](/wiki/Quaestors \"Quaestors\"). Although it did have senators,\nthey held the title _clarus_ , not _[clarissimus](/wiki/Clarissimus\n\"Clarissimus\")_ , like those of Rome. It also lacked the panoply of other\nadministrative offices regulating the food supply, police, statues, temples,\nsewers, aqueducts, or other public works. The new programme of building was\ncarried out in great haste: columns, marbles, doors, and tiles were taken\nwholesale from the temples of the empire and moved to the new city. In similar\nfashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be\nseen in its squares and streets. The emperor stimulated private building by\npromising householders gifts of land from the imperial estates in\n[Asiana](/wiki/Diocese_of_Asia \"Diocese of Asia\") and\n[Pontica](/wiki/Diocese_of_Pontus \"Diocese of Pontus\") and on 18 May 332 he\nannounced that, as in Rome, free distributions of food would be made to the\ncitizens. At the time, the amount is said to have been 80,000 rations a day,\ndoled out from 117 distribution points around the city.[35]\n\nConstantine laid out a new square at the centre of old Byzantium, naming it\nthe [Augustaeum](/wiki/Augustaion \"Augustaion\"). The new senate-house (or\nCuria) was housed in a basilica on the east side. On the south side of the\ngreat square was erected the [Great\nPalace](/wiki/Great_Palace_of_Constantinople \"Great Palace of Constantinople\")\nof the Emperor with its imposing entrance, the [Chalke](/wiki/Chalke\n\"Chalke\"), and its ceremonial suite known as the [Palace of\nDaphne](/wiki/Daphne_Palace \"Daphne Palace\"). Nearby was the vast\n[Hippodrome](/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople \"Hippodrome of\nConstantinople\") for chariot-races, seating over 80,000 spectators, and the\nfamed [Baths of Zeuxippus](/wiki/Baths_of_Zeuxippus \"Baths of Zeuxippus\"). At\nthe western entrance to the Augustaeum was the [Milion](/wiki/Milion\n\"Milion\"), a vaulted monument from which distances were measured across the\nEastern Roman Empire.\n\nFrom the Augustaeum led a great street, the\n[Mese](/wiki/Mese_\\(Constantinople\\) \"Mese \\(Constantinople\\)\") (Greek: Μέση\n[Οδός] lit. \"Middle [Street]\"), lined with colonnades. As it descended the\nFirst Hill of the city and climbed the Second Hill, it passed on the left the\n[Praetorium](/wiki/Praetorium \"Praetorium\") or law-court. Then it passed\nthrough the oval [Forum of Constantine](/wiki/Forum_of_Constantine \"Forum of\nConstantine\") where there was a second Senate-house and a [high\ncolumn](/wiki/Column_of_Constantine \"Column of Constantine\") with a statue of\nConstantine himself in the guise of [Helios](/wiki/Helios \"Helios\"), crowned\nwith a halo of seven rays and looking toward the rising sun.

From the death\nof Constantine in 337 to the accession of Theodosius I, emperors had been\nresident only in the years 337-8, 347–51, 358–61, 368–69. Its status as a\ncapital was recognized by the appointment of the first known Urban Prefect of\nthe City Honoratus, who held office from 11 December 359 until 361. The urban\nprefects had concurrent jurisdiction over three provinces each in the adjacent\ndioceses of Thrace (in which the city was located), Pontus and Asia comparable\nto the 100-mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of Rome. The emperor\n[Valens](/wiki/Valens \"Valens\"), who hated the city and spent only one year\nthere, nevertheless built the Palace of [Hebdomon](/wiki/Hebdomon \"Hebdomon\")\non the shore of the [Propontis](/wiki/Sea_of_Marmara \"Sea of Marmara\") near\nthe [Golden Gate](/wiki/Golden_Gate_\\(Constantinople\\) \"Golden Gate\n\\(Constantinople\\)\"), probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors\nup to [Zeno](/wiki/Zeno_\\(emperor\\) \"Zeno \\(emperor\\)\") and\n[Basiliscus](/wiki/Basiliscus \"Basiliscus\") were crowned and acclaimed at the\nHebdomon.

Subsequent to this, new walls were built to\ndefend the city and the fleet on the Danube improved.\n\nAfter the [barbarians](/wiki/Barbarian \"Barbarian\") overran the Western Roman\nEmpire, Constantinople became the indisputable capital city of the Roman\nEmpire. Emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and\npalaces. They remained in their palace in the Great City and sent generals to\ncommand their armies.

It\nwas from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former\nDiocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533. Before their departure,\nthe ship of the commander [Belisarius](/wiki/Belisarius \"Belisarius\") was\nanchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers\nfor the success of the enterprise.

In Constantinople,\nthe hippodrome became over time increasingly a place of political\nsignificance. It was where (as a shadow of the popular elections of old Rome)\nthe people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor, and also\nwhere they openly criticized the government, or clamoured for the removal of\nunpopular ministers. In the time of Justinian, public order in Constantinople\nbecame a critical political issue.\n\nThroughout the late Roman and early Byzantine periods, Christianity was\nresolving fundamental questions of identity, and the dispute between the\n[orthodox](/wiki/Christian_orthodoxy \"Christian orthodoxy\") and the\n[monophysites](/wiki/Monophysites \"Monophysites\") became the cause of serious\ndisorder, expressed through allegiance to the horse-racing parties of the\nBlues and the Greens. The partisans of the Blues and the Greens were said[39]\nto affect untrimmed facial hair, head hair shaved at the front and grown long\nat the back, and wide-sleeved tunics tight at the wrist; and to form gangs to\nengage in night-time muggings and street violence. At last these disorders\ntook the form of a major rebellion of 532, known as the [\"Nika\"\nriots](/wiki/Nika_riots \"Nika riots\") (from the battle-cry of \"Victory!\" of\nthose involved).\n\nFires started by the Nika rioters consumed Constantine's basilica of Hagia\nSophia (Holy Wisdom), the city's principal church, which lay to the north of\nthe Augustaeum. Justinian commissioned [Anthemius of\nTralles](/wiki/Anthemius_of_Tralles \"Anthemius of Tralles\") and [Isidore of\nMiletus](/wiki/Isidore_of_Miletus \"Isidore of Miletus\") to replace it with a\nnew and incomparable [Hagia Sophia](/wiki/Hagia_Sophia \"Hagia Sophia\"). This\nwas the great cathedral of the Orthodox Church, whose dome was said to be held\naloft by God alone, and which was directly connected to the palace so that the\nimperial family could attend services without passing through the streets.[40]\nThe dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the presence of the emperor,\nwho exclaimed, \"O [Solomon](/wiki/Solomon%27s_Temple \"Solomon's Temple\"), I\nhave outdone thee!\"[41] Hagia Sophia was served by 600 people including 80\npriests, and cost 20,000 pounds of gold to build.[42]\n\nJustinian also had Anthemius and Isidore demolish and replace the original\nChurch of the Holy Apostles built by Constantine with a [new\nchurch](/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Apostles \"Church of the Holy Apostles\") under\nthe same dedication. This was designed in the form of an equal-armed cross\nwith five domes, and ornamented with beautiful mosaics. This church was to\nremain the burial place of the Emperors from Constantine himself until the\n11th century. When the city fell to the Turks in 1453, the church was\ndemolished to make room for the tomb of [Mehmet II](/wiki/Mehmet_II \"Mehmet\nII\") the Conqueror. Justinian was also concerned with other aspects of the\ncity's built environment, legislating against the abuse of laws prohibiting\nbuilding within 100 feet (30 m) of the sea front, in order to protect the\nview.[43]\n\nDuring Justinian I's reign, the city's population reached about 500,000\npeople.[44] However, the social fabric of Constantinople was also damaged by\nthe onset of the [Plague of Justinian](/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian \"Plague of\nJustinian\") between 541–542 AD.

The emperor [Leo III](/wiki/Leo_III_the_Isaurian \"Leo III the\nIsaurian\") issued a decree in 726 against images, and ordered the destruction\nof a statue of Christ over one of the doors of the Chalke, an act that was\nfiercely resisted by the citizens.[56] [Constantine V](/wiki/Constantine_V\n\"Constantine V\") convoked a [church council in 754](/wiki/Council_of_Hieria\n\"Council of Hieria\"), which condemned the worship of images, after which many\ntreasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds\nor animals: One source refers to the [church of the Holy\nVirgin](/wiki/Church_of_St._Mary_of_Blachernae_\\(Istanbul\\) \"Church of St.\nMary of Blachernae \\(Istanbul\\)\") at [Blachernae](/wiki/Blachernae\n\"Blachernae\") as having been transformed into a \"fruit store and aviary\".[57]\nFollowing the death of her son [Leo IV](/wiki/Leo_IV_the_Khazar \"Leo IV the\nKhazar\") in 780, the empress [Irene](/wiki/Irene_\\(empress\\) \"Irene\n\\(empress\\)\") restored the veneration of images through the agency of the\n[Second Council of Nicaea](/wiki/Second_Council_of_Nicaea \"Second Council of\nNicaea\") in 787.\n\nThe iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century, only to be\nresolved once more in 843 during the regency of Empress\n[Theodora](/wiki/Theodora_\\(9th_century\\) \"Theodora \\(9th century\\)\"), who\nrestored the icons. These controversies contributed to the deterioration of\nrelations between the [Western](/wiki/Catholicism \"Catholicism\") and the\n[Eastern](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church \"Eastern Orthodox Church\") Churches.\n\n### 1025–1081: Constantinople after Basil\nII[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: 1025–1081: Constantinople after Basil II\")]\n\nIn the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous\ndefeat of the imperial armies at the [Battle of\nManzikert](/wiki/Battle_of_Manzikert \"Battle of Manzikert\") in Armenia in\n1071. The Emperor [Romanus](/wiki/Romanos_IV \"Romanos IV\") Diogenes was\ncaptured. The peace terms demanded by [Alp Arslan](/wiki/Alp_Arslan \"Alp\nArslan\"), sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted\nthem. On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own\ncandidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered\ndeath by torture, and the new ruler, [Michael VII](/wiki/Michael_VII \"Michael\nVII\") Ducas, refused to honour the treaty. In response, the Turks began to\nmove into Anatolia in 1073. The collapse of the old defensive system meant\nthat they met no opposition, and the empire's resources were distracted and\nsquandered in a series of civil wars. Thousands of\n[Turkoman](/wiki/Turkmen_people \"Turkmen people\") tribesmen crossed the\nunguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, a huge area had been lost\nto the Empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople.\n\n### 1081–1185: Constantinople under the\nComneni[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: 1081–1185: Constantinople under the Comneni\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ed/Byzantium%401180.jpg/220px-\nByzantium%401180.jpg)](/wiki/File:Byzantium@1180.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Byzantium@1180.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Byzantine Empire](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire \"Byzantine Empire\") under\n[Manuel I](/wiki/Manuel_I_Komnenos \"Manuel I Komnenos\"), c. 1180\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Istanbul_2009_Comnenus_Mosaics.JPG/220px-\nIstanbul_2009_Comnenus_Mosaics.JPG)](/wiki/File:Istanbul_2009_Comnenus_Mosaics.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Istanbul_2009_Comnenus_Mosaics.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n12th century [mosaic](/wiki/Mosaic \"Mosaic\") from the upper gallery of the\n[Hagia Sophia](/wiki/Hagia_Sophia \"Hagia Sophia\"), Constantinople.

In 1090–91, the nomadic [Pechenegs](/wiki/Pechenegs \"Pechenegs\")\nreached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of\nthe [Kipchaks](/wiki/Kipchaks \"Kipchaks\") annihilated their army.[58] In\nresponse to a call for aid from [Alexius](/wiki/Alexios_I_Komnenos \"Alexios I\nKomnenos\"), the [First Crusade](/wiki/First_Crusade \"First Crusade\") assembled\nat Constantinople in 1096, but declining to put itself under Byzantine command\nset out for [Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\") on its own account.[59]\n[John II](/wiki/John_II_Komnenos \"John II Komnenos\") built the monastery of\nthe Pantocrator (Almighty) with a hospital for the poor of 50 beds.[60]\n\nWith the restoration of firm central government, the empire became fabulously\nwealthy. The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th\ncentury vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the\nrealm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically\nincreased. This was reflected in Constantinople by the construction of the\nBlachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general\nprosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of\nthe Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is\ncertain that the [Venetians](/wiki/Venice \"Venice\") and others were active\ntraders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the\nCrusader Kingdoms of [Outremer](/wiki/Outremer \"Outremer\") and the West, while\nalso trading extensively with Byzantium and [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt \"Egypt\"). The\nVenetians had factories on the north side of the Golden Horn, and large\nnumbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century.\nToward the end of [Manuel I Komnenos](/wiki/Manuel_I_Komnenos \"Manuel I\nKomnenos\")'s reign, the number of foreigners in the city reached about\n60,000–80,000 people out of a total population of about 400,000 people.[61] In\n1171, Constantinople also contained a small community of 2,500 Jews.[62] In\n1182, all Latin (Western European) inhabitants of Constantinople [were\nmassacred](/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Latins \"Massacre of the Latins\").[63]\n\nIn artistic terms, the 12th century was a very productive period. There was a\nrevival in the [mosaic](/wiki/Mosaic \"Mosaic\") art, for example: Mosaics\nbecame more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting\nthree-dimensional forms. There was an increased demand for art, with more\npeople having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such\nwork. According to N.H. Baynes (_Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman\nCivilization_):\n\n    \"With its love of luxury and passion for colour, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the whole of the Christian world. Beautiful silks from the workshops of Constantinople also portrayed in dazzling colour animals – lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins – confronting each other, or represented Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase.\"\n\n    \"From the tenth to the twelfth century Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark's at Venice and of the cathedral at [Torcello](/wiki/Torcello \"Torcello\") clearly reveal their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the [Palatine Chapel](/wiki/Cappella_Palatina \"Cappella Palatina\"), the [Martorana](/wiki/Martorana \"Martorana\") at [Palermo](/wiki/Palermo \"Palermo\"), and the [cathedral of Cefalù](/wiki/Cathedral_of_Cefal%C3%B9 \"Cathedral of Cefalù\"), together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, demonstrate the influence of Byzantium on the [Norman](/wiki/Italo-Normans \"Italo-Normans\") Court of [Sicily](/wiki/Sicily \"Sicily\") in the twelfth century. Hispano-[Moorish](/wiki/Moorish \"Moorish\") art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. [Romanesque art](/wiki/Romanesque_art \"Romanesque art\") owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of [Kiev](/wiki/Kiev \"Kiev\"), [Venetian doges](/wiki/Doge_of_Venice \"Doge of Venice\"), abbots of [Monte Cassino](/wiki/Monte_Cassino \"Monte Cassino\"), merchants of [Amalfi](/wiki/Amalfi \"Amalfi\"), and the kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the twelfth century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centres dedicated to its production.\"\n\n### 1185–1261: Constantinople during the Imperial\nExile[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: 1185–1261: Constantinople during the Imperial Exile\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

The\nborders are very uncertain\n\nOn 25 July 1197, Constantinople was struck by a [severe\nfire](/wiki/Constantine_stilbes#Works \"Constantine stilbes\") which burned the\nLatin Quarter and the area around the Gate of the Droungarios\n([Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_language \"Turkish language\"): _Odun Kapısı_) on the\nGolden Horn.[64][65] Nevertheless, the destruction wrought by the 1197 fire\npaled in comparison with that brought by the Crusaders. In the course of a\nplot between [Philip of Swabia](/wiki/Philip_of_Swabia \"Philip of Swabia\"),\n[Boniface of Montferrat](/wiki/Boniface_of_Montferrat \"Boniface of\nMontferrat\") and the [Doge of Venice](/wiki/Enrico_Dandolo \"Enrico Dandolo\"),\nthe [Fourth Crusade](/wiki/Fourth_Crusade \"Fourth Crusade\") was, despite papal\nexcommunication, diverted in 1203 against Constantinople, ostensibly promoting\nthe claims of Alexius, son of the deposed emperor Isaac. The reigning emperor\nAlexius III had made no preparation. The Crusaders occupied\n[Galata](/wiki/Galata \"Galata\"), broke the [defensive\nchain](/wiki/Boom_\\(navigational_barrier\\) \"Boom \\(navigational barrier\\)\")\nprotecting the [Golden Horn](/wiki/Golden_Horn \"Golden Horn\") and entered the\nharbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexius III fled. But\nthe new [Alexius IV](/wiki/Alexius_IV \"Alexius IV\") found the Treasury\ninadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his\nwestern allies. Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased.\nIn January 1204, the _[protovestiarius](/wiki/Protovestiarius\n\"Protovestiarius\")_ Alexius Murzuphlus provoked a riot, it is presumed, to\nintimidate Alexius IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great\nstatue of Athena, the work of [Phidias](/wiki/Phidias \"Phidias\"), which stood\nin the principal forum facing west.\n\nIn February, the people rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed,\nand Murzuphlus took the purple as [Alexius V](/wiki/Alexius_V \"Alexius V\"). He\nmade some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry, but there\nhad been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards\nwere demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April\nfailed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the\ninvaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in Hagia Sophia and offered\nthe crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but\nit was too late. He came out with the Patriarch to the [Golden\nMilestone](/wiki/Milion \"Milion\") before the Great Palace and addressed the\nVarangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility\nand embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were\ninstalled in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for\nthree days.\n\n[Sir Steven Runciman](/wiki/Sir_Steven_Runciman \"Sir Steven Runciman\"),\nhistorian of the Crusades, wrote that the sack of Constantinople is\n“unparalleled in history”.\n\n> “For nine centuries,” he goes on, “the great city had been the capital of\n> Christian civilisation. It was filled with works of art that had survived\n> from ancient Greece and with the masterpieces of its own exquisite\n> craftsmen.

Under the rulers of the Latin\nEmpire, the city declined, both in population and the condition of its\nbuildings. Alice-Mary Talbot cites an estimated population for Constantinople\nof 400,000 inhabitants; after the destruction wrought by the Crusaders on the\ncity, about one third were homeless, and numerous courtiers, nobility, and\nhigher clergy, followed various leading personages into exile. \"As a result\nConstantinople became seriously depopulated,\" Talbot concludes.[67]\n\nThe Latins took over at least 20 churches and 13 monasteries, most prominently\nthe Hagia Sophia, which became the cathedral of the Latin Patriarch of\nConstantinople. It is to these that E.H. Swift attributed the construction of\na series of flying buttresses to shore up the walls of the church, which had\nbeen weakened over the centuries by earthquake tremors.[68] However, this act\nof maintenance is an exception: for the most part, the Latin occupiers were\ntoo few to maintain all of the buildings, either secular and sacred, and many\nbecame targets for vandalism or dismantling. Bronze and lead were removed from\nthe roofs of abandoned buildings and melted down and sold to provide money to\nthe chronically under-funded Empire for defense and to support the court; Deno\nJohn Geanokoplos writes that \"it may well be that a division is suggested\nhere: Latin laymen stripped secular buildings, ecclesiastics, the\nchurches.\"[69] Buildings were not the only targets of officials looking to\nraise funds for the impoverished Latin Empire: the monumental sculptures which\nadorned the Hippodrome and fora of the city were pulled down and melted for\ncoinage. \"Among the masterpieces destroyed, writes Talbot, \"were a Herakles\nattributed to the fourth-century B.C. sculptor [Lysippos](/wiki/Lysippos\n\"Lysippos\"), and monumental figures of Hera, Paris, and Helen.\"[70]\n\nThe Nicaean emperor [John III Vatatzes](/wiki/John_III_Vatatzes \"John III\nVatatzes\") reportedly saved several churches from being dismantled for their\nvaluable building materials; by sending money to the Latins \"to buy them off\"\n(_exonesamenos_), he prevented the destruction of several churches.[71]\nAccording to Talbot, these included the churches of Blachernae, Rouphinianai,\nand St. Michael at Anaplous. He also granted funds for the restoration of the\n[Church of the Holy Apostles](/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Apostles \"Church of the\nHoly Apostles\"), which had been seriously damaged in an earthquake.[70]\n\nThe Byzantine nobility scattered, many going to\n[Nicaea](/wiki/Empire_of_Nicaea \"Empire of Nicaea\"), where Theodore Lascaris\nset up an imperial court, or to [Epirus](/wiki/Despotate_of_Epirus \"Despotate\nof Epirus\"), where Theodore Angelus did the same; others fled to\n[Trebizond](/wiki/Empire_of_Trebizond \"Empire of Trebizond\"), where one of the\nComneni had already with Georgian support established an independent seat of\nempire.[72] Nicaea and Epirus both vied for the imperial title, and tried to\nrecover Constantinople. In 1261, Constantinople was\n[captured](/wiki/Reconquest_of_Constantinople \"Reconquest of Constantinople\")\nfrom its last Latin ruler, [Baldwin II](/wiki/Baldwin_II_of_Constantinople\n\"Baldwin II of Constantinople\"), by the forces of the [Nicaean\nemperor](/wiki/Nicaean_Empire \"Nicaean Empire\") [Michael VIII\nPalaiologos](/wiki/Michael_VIII_Palaiologos \"Michael VIII Palaiologos\").\n\n### 1261–1453: Palaiologan Era and the Fall of\nConstantinople[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: 1261–1453: Palaiologan Era and the Fall of Constantinople\")]\n\nSee also: [Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos\ndynasty](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire_under_the_Palaiologos_dynasty \"Byzantine\nEmpire under the Palaiologos dynasty\") and [Fall of\nConstantinople](/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople \"Fall of Constantinople\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Zonaro_GatesofConst.jpg/220px-\nZonaro_GatesofConst.jpg)](/wiki/File:Zonaro_GatesofConst.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Zonaro_GatesofConst.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMehmed the Conqueror enters Constantinople, painting by [Fausto\nZonaro](/wiki/Fausto_Zonaro \"Fausto Zonaro\")\n\nAlthough Constantinople was retaken by [Michael VIII\nPalaiologos](/wiki/Michael_VIII_Palaiologos \"Michael VIII Palaiologos\"), the\nEmpire had lost many of its key economic resources, and struggled to survive.\nThe [palace of Blachernae](/wiki/Palace_of_Blachernae \"Palace of Blachernae\")\nin the north-west of the city became the main Imperial residence, with the old\nGreat Palace on the shores of the [Bosporus](/wiki/Bosporus \"Bosporus\") going\ninto decline. When Michael VIII captured the city, its population was 35,000\npeople, but, by the end of his reign, he had succeeded in increasing the\npopulation to about 70,000 people.[73] The Emperor achieved this by summoning\nformer residents who had fled the city when the crusaders captured it, and by\nrelocating Greeks from the recently reconquered\n[Peloponnese](/wiki/Peloponnese \"Peloponnese\") to the capital.[74] In 1347,\nthe [Black Death](/wiki/Black_Death \"Black Death\") spread to\nConstantinople.[75] In 1453, when the Ottoman Turks [captured the\ncity](/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople \"Fall of Constantinople\"), it contained\napproximately 50,000 people.[76]\n\nConstantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453.

Building projects were commenced immediately after\nthe conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the\ncitadel, and building a new palace.[79] Mehmed issued orders across his empire\nthat Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that\nfive thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by\nSeptember.[79] From all over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported\npeople were sent to the city: these people were called \"Sürgün\" in Turkish\n([Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\"): σουργούνιδες).[10] Two\ncenturies later, Ottoman traveler [Evliya Çelebi](/wiki/Evliya_%C3%87elebi\n\"Evliya Çelebi\") gave a list of groups introduced into the city with their\nrespective origins.

At its peak, roughly corresponding to the\nMiddle Ages, it was the richest and largest European city, exerting a powerful\ncultural pull and dominating economic life in the Mediterranean.

From the 5th\ncentury, the city was also protected by the [Anastasian\nWall](/wiki/Anastasian_Wall \"Anastasian Wall\"), a 60-kilometer chain of walls\nacross the [Thracian](/wiki/Thrace \"Thrace\") [peninsula](/wiki/Peninsula\n\"Peninsula\"). Many\nscholars[_[who?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] argue that these sophisticated\nfortifications allowed the east to develop relatively unmolested while\n[Ancient Rome](/wiki/Ancient_Rome \"Ancient Rome\") and [the\nwest](/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire \"Western Roman Empire\") collapsed.\n\nConstantinople's fame was such that [it was described](/wiki/Sino-\nRoman_relations \"Sino-Roman relations\") even in contemporary [Chinese\nhistories](/wiki/Twenty-Four_Histories \"Twenty-Four Histories\"), the\n_[Old](/wiki/Old_Book_of_Tang \"Old Book of Tang\")_ and _[New Book of\nTang](/wiki/New_Book_of_Tang \"New Book of Tang\")_ , which mentioned its\nmassive walls and gates as well as a purported [clepsydra](/wiki/Water_clock\n\"Water clock\") mounted with a golden statue of a man.[81][82][83] The Chinese\nhistories even related how the city [had been\nbesieged](/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_\\(674-678\\) \"Siege of Constantinople\n\\(674-678\\)\") in the 7th century by [Muawiyah I](/wiki/Muawiyah_I \"Muawiyah\nI\") and how he exacted [tribute](/wiki/Tribute \"Tribute\") in a peace\nsettlement.[82][84]\n\n###\nArchitecture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Architecture\")]\n\nMain article: [Byzantine architecture](/wiki/Byzantine_architecture \"Byzantine\narchitecture\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Ayasofya-\nInnenansicht.jpg/220px-Ayasofya-Innenansicht.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ayasofya-\nInnenansicht.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ayasofya-Innenansicht.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nInterior view of the [Hagia Sophia](/wiki/Hagia_Sophia \"Hagia Sophia\"),\ncurrently a museum.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to\ncreate its own unique type of architecture. The influence of Byzantine\narchitecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout\nEurope. Particular examples include [St Mark's\nBasilica](/wiki/St_Mark%27s_Basilica \"St Mark's Basilica\") in Venice, the\nbasilicas of [Ravenna](/wiki/Ravenna \"Ravenna\"), and many churches throughout\nthe Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th-century Italian\n[florin](/wiki/Italian_coin_florin \"Italian coin florin\"), the Empire\ncontinued to produce sound gold coinage, the [solidus](/wiki/Solidus_\\(coin\\)\n\"Solidus \\(coin\\)\") of [Diocletian](/wiki/Diocletian \"Diocletian\") becoming\nthe [bezant](/wiki/Bezant \"Bezant\") prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its\n[city walls](/wiki/Theodosian_Walls \"Theodosian Walls\") were much imitated\n(for example, see [Caernarfon Castle](/wiki/Caernarfon_Castle \"Caernarfon\nCastle\")) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the\nMiddle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman\nEmpire. In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used.\n\n### Religion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constantinople&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Religion\")]\n\nConstantine's foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who\neventually came to be known as the [Ecumenical\nPatriarch](/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_of_Constantinople \"Ecumenical Patriarch\nof Constantinople\"), and made it a prime center of Christianity alongside\nRome. This contributed to cultural and theological differences between Eastern\nand Western Christianity eventually leading to the [Great Schism](/wiki/East-\nWest_Schism \"East-West Schism\") that divided [Western\nCatholicism](/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church \"Roman Catholic Church\") from\n[Eastern Orthodoxy](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodoxy \"Eastern Orthodoxy\") from 1054\nonwards.
