Their final trick\nappears to transport one of the audience members to the vault of his bank, the\nCrédit Républicain in Paris, where stacks of new euro bills are stored. At the\nmagicians' command, the fans in the vault activate, drawing the bills into the\nvents and then showering the Las Vegas crowd with them. The euros are shown to\nbe real, and the vault in Paris is found to be empty of its recent shipment of\neuros. [FBI](/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation \"Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation\") agent Dylan Rhodes ([Mark Ruffalo](/wiki/Mark_Ruffalo \"Mark\nRuffalo\")), and [Interpol](/wiki/Interpol \"Interpol\") agent Alma Dray\n([Mélanie Laurent](/wiki/M%C3%A9lanie_Laurent \"Mélanie Laurent\")), are then\npartnered to investigate the Horsemen. The two question the magicians but have\nno evidence to hold them. Dylan and Alma turn to Thaddeus Bradley ([Morgan\nFreeman](/wiki/Morgan_Freeman \"Morgan Freeman\")), a former magician who now\nmakes money by explaining the tricks behind magic acts. Thaddeus demonstrates\nhow the Horsemen used a mock vault under the Las Vegas stage and says that the\ngroup must have stolen the money in Paris before it arrived at the bank,\nreplacing it with [flash paper](/wiki/Nitrocellulose \"Nitrocellulose\") that\nleft no evidence.\n\nDylan, Alma, and Thaddeus follow the Horsemen to their next show in New\nOrleans, where their final trick appears to transfer millions of dollars from\nTressler's private accounts to those in the audience, made up of people that\nwere denied insurance claims by Tressler's company in the wake of [Hurricane\nKatrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina \"Hurricane Katrina\"). Dylan and Alma attempt\nto apprehend the four, but the magicians elude arrest. Tressler hires Thaddeus\nto expose the Horsemen in revenge for the loss of his money. Alma investigates\nthe Horsemen and determines they are connected to a group called the Eye, a\nsmall group of magicians that claim to have access to real magic. She finds\nout one of the Eye's members, Lionel Shrike, had previously been exposed by\nThaddeus but died in a locked-safe escape trick he was performing in an\nattempt to regain his standing. Alma suspects a fifth person is aiding the\nHorsemen.\n\nAlma's research leads the FBI to the New York City apartment. When they raid\nit, three of the Horsemen escape while Jack recovers numerous documents and\nthen leads the authorities on a high-speed car chase. Jack loses control of\nhis car, causing it to flip and catch fire. Dylan is unable to save Jack, but\nmanages to recover the papers, pointing to the Horsemen's next planned crime,\nstealing millions of dollars in cash out of a large safe of the Elkhorn\ncompany. Dylan, Alma, and Thaddeus find the safe has already been stolen, and\nwhen they track it down, its contents have been replaced with balloon animals.\nThe Horsemen broadcast they will perform their final show that night at [5\nPointz](/wiki/5_Pointz \"5 Pointz\"), inviting the public to attend. The FBI and\npolice converge on the scene and amid the chaos search for the Horsemen. The\nremaining Horsemen appear to the crowd, giving their fans a farewell and a\nmessage about an ulterior purpose, and then run to jump off a roof; Dylan\nattempts to shoot them but Alma holds him back. The three jump, turning into a\nshower of money over the crowd. The money is counterfeit, but the audience's\nrace to collect it prevents the authorities from tracking the real Horsemen.\n\nAfter the show, Thaddeus walks to his car, only to find it full of the money\nstolen from the Elkhorn safe. Assumed to be the fifth Horseman, he is\narrested. Dylan speaks to Thaddeus in jail, where Thaddeus slowly comes to\nrealize that Alma's theory was correct, and Dylan was the fifth Horseman.\nDylan quietly walks away, leaving Thaddeus shouting \"Why?\". Elsewhere, the\nHorsemen (including Jack, who had faked his death using a duplicate car and an\nalready-dead body) meet at the carousel in Central Park, and use their tarot\ncards to turn it on. Dylan arrives and welcomes the four to the Eye.\n\nLater, at the [Pont des Arts](/wiki/Pont_des_Arts \"Pont des Arts\"), Dylan\nmeets with Alma and reveals he is Shrike's son. He brought the Horsemen\ntogether to get retribution for his father's death: the Elkhorn Safe Company\nfor providing a faulty safe that led to the accident; Thaddeus for humiliating\nand impoverishing his father and forcing him to try the new trick to regain\nhis standing; and the Crédit Républicain and Tressler's insurance companies\nfor failing to pay out life insurance on Shrike afterwards. Alma, who has come\ninto a romantic relationship with Dylan, decides not to turn him in. She takes\na lock and a key that Dylan produces, attaching the lock among the other [love\nlocks](/wiki/Love_lock \"Love lock\") on the railing and throwing the key into\nthe [Seine](/wiki/Seine \"Seine\").\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Now_You_See_Me_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Jesse Eisenberg](/wiki/Jesse_Eisenberg \"Jesse Eisenberg\") as J.
