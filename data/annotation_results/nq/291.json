The trade winds blow predominantly\nfrom the northeast in the [Northern Hemisphere](/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere\n\"Northern Hemisphere\") and from the southeast in the [Southern\nHemisphere](/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere \"Southern Hemisphere\"), strengthening\nduring the winter and when the [Arctic oscillation](/wiki/Arctic_oscillation\n\"Arctic oscillation\") is in its warm phase. Trade winds have been used by\ncaptains of [sailing ships](/wiki/Sailing_ship \"Sailing ship\") to cross the\nworld's oceans for centuries, and enabled colonial expansion into the Americas\nand trade routes to become established across the\n[Atlantic](/wiki/Atlantic_ocean \"Atlantic ocean\") and [Pacific\noceans](/wiki/Pacific_ocean \"Pacific ocean\").\n\nIn [meteorology](/wiki/Meteorology \"Meteorology\"), the trade winds act as the\n[steering flow](/wiki/Prevailing_winds \"Prevailing winds\") for [tropical\nstorms](/wiki/Tropical_storms \"Tropical storms\") that form over the Atlantic,\nPacific, and southern [Indian Oceans](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian Ocean\") and\nmake landfall in North America, Southeast Asia, and Madagascar and eastern\nAfrica, respectively. Trade winds also transport African dust westward across\nthe [Atlantic Ocean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean \"Atlantic Ocean\") into the\n[Caribbean Sea](/wiki/Caribbean_Sea \"Caribbean Sea\"), as well as portions of\nsoutheastern [North America](/wiki/North_America \"North America\"). Shallow\n[cumulus clouds](/wiki/Cumulus_cloud \"Cumulus cloud\") are seen within trade\nwind regimes, and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion,\nwhich is caused by descending air aloft from within the [subtropical\nridge](/wiki/Subtropical_ridge \"Subtropical ridge\"). The weaker the trade\nwinds become, the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Cause\n  * 3 Weather effects\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trade_winds&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Spanish_Galleon.jpg/200px-\nSpanish_Galleon.jpg)](/wiki/File:Spanish_Galleon.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Spanish_Galleon.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA Spanish galleon\n\nSee also: [Age of Discovery](/wiki/Age_of_Discovery \"Age of Discovery\"),\n[Volta do Mar](/wiki/Volta_do_Mar \"Volta do Mar\"), and [Age of\nsail](/wiki/Age_of_sail \"Age of sail\")\n\nThe term _trade winds_ originally derives from the early fourteenth century\nlate [Middle English](/wiki/Middle_English \"Middle English\") word 'trade,'\nmeaning \"path\" or \"track.\"[1] The Portuguese recognized the importance of the\ntrade winds (then the _[Volta do mar](/wiki/Volta_do_mar \"Volta do mar\")_ ,\nmeaning in Portuguese \"turn of the sea\" but also \"return from the sea\") in\nnavigation in both the north and south Atlantic ocean as early as the 15th\ncentury.[2] From West Africa, the Portuguese had to sail away from continental\nAfrica, that is, to west and northwest. They could then turn northeast, to the\narea around the [Azores](/wiki/Azores \"Azores\") islands, and finally east to\nmainland Europe. They also learned that to reach South Africa, they needed to\ngo far out in the ocean, head for Brazil, and around 30°S go east again.\nFollowing the African coast southbound means upwind in the Southern\nhemisphere. In the Pacific ocean, the full wind circulation, which included\nboth the trade wind easterlies and higher-latitude\n[Westerlies](/wiki/Westerlies \"Westerlies\"), was unknown to Europeans until\n[Andres de Urdaneta](/wiki/Andres_de_Urdaneta \"Andres de Urdaneta\")'s voyage\nin 1565.[3]\n\nThe captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be\nexpected to blow in the direction of travel.[4] During the [Age of\nSail](/wiki/Age_of_Sail \"Age of Sail\"), the pattern of [prevailing\nwinds](/wiki/Prevailing_winds \"Prevailing winds\") made various points of the\nglobe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on\nEuropean empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example,\n[Manila galleons](/wiki/Manila_galleon \"Manila galleon\") could not sail into\nthe wind at all.[3]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Edmond_Halley%27s_map_of_the_trade_winds%2C_1686.jpg/275px-\nEdmond_Halley%27s_map_of_the_trade_winds%2C_1686.jpg)](/wiki/File:Edmond_Halley%27s_map_of_the_trade_winds,_1686.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Edmond_Halley%27s_map_of_the_trade_winds,_1686.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Edmond Halley](/wiki/Edmond_Halley \"Edmond Halley\")'s map of the trade winds,\n1686\n\nBy the 18th century the importance of the trade winds to England's merchant\nfleet for crossing the Atlantic Ocean had led both the general public and\netymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of 'trade', \"(foreign)\ncommerce\".[5] Between 1847 and 1849, [Matthew Fontaine\nMaury](/wiki/Matthew_Fontaine_Maury \"Matthew Fontaine Maury\") collected enough\ninformation to create wind and current charts for the world's oceans.[6]\n\n## Cause[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trade_winds&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Cause\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Earth_Global_Circulation_-\n_en.svg/400px-Earth_Global_Circulation_-\n_en.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Earth_Global_Circulation_-_en.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Earth_Global_Circulation_-_en.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n3D map showing [Hadley cells](/wiki/Hadley_cell \"Hadley cell\") in relationship\nto trade winds on the surface.\n\nSee also: [Air mass](/wiki/Air_mass \"Air mass\"), [Hadley\ncell](/wiki/Hadley_cell \"Hadley cell\"), [Humidity](/wiki/Humidity \"Humidity\"),\n[Intertropical Convergence Zone](/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone\n\"Intertropical Convergence Zone\"), [Monsoon](/wiki/Monsoon \"Monsoon\"),\n[Monsoon trough](/wiki/Monsoon_trough \"Monsoon trough\"), [Near-equatorial\ntrough](/wiki/Near-equatorial_trough \"Near-equatorial trough\"), and\n[Prevailing winds](/wiki/Prevailing_winds \"Prevailing winds\")\n\nAs part of the [Hadley cell](/wiki/Hadley_cell \"Hadley cell\"), surface air\nflows toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the\n[poles](/wiki/Geographic_pole \"Geographic pole\"). A [low-pressure\narea](/wiki/Low-pressure_area \"Low-pressure area\") of calm, light variable\nwinds near the equator is known as the [doldrums](/wiki/Doldrums\n\"Doldrums\"),[7] near-equatorial trough,[8] intertropical front, or the\n[Intertropical Convergence Zone](/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone\n\"Intertropical Convergence Zone\").[9] When located within a\n[monsoon](/wiki/Monsoon \"Monsoon\") region, this zone of low pressure and wind\nconvergence is also known as the [monsoon trough](/wiki/Monsoon_trough\n\"Monsoon trough\").[10] Around 30° in both hemispheres, air begins to descend\ntoward the surface in subtropical high-pressure belts known as [subtropical\nridges](/wiki/Subtropical_ridge \"Subtropical ridge\"). The subsident (sinking)\nair is relatively dry because as it descends, the temperature increases, but\nthe absolute humidity remains constant, which lowers the relative humidity of\nthe air mass. This warm, dry air is known as a superior air mass and normally\nresides above a maritime tropical (warm and moist) air mass. An increase of\ntemperature with height is known as a temperature inversion. When it occurs\nwithin a trade wind regime, it is known as a trade wind inversion.[11]\n\nThe surface air that flows from these subtropical high-pressure belts toward\nthe Equator is deflected toward the west in both hemispheres by the [Coriolis\neffect](/wiki/Coriolis_effect \"Coriolis effect\").[12] These winds blow\npredominantly from the northeast in the [Northern\nHemisphere](/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere \"Northern Hemisphere\") and from the\nsoutheast in the [Southern Hemisphere](/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere \"Southern\nHemisphere\").[13] Because winds are named for the direction from which the\nwind is blowing,[14] these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in\nthe Northern Hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the Southern\nHemisphere. The trade winds of both hemispheres meet at the\n[doldrums](/wiki/Doldrums \"Doldrums\").[7]\n\nAs they blow across tropical regions, air masses heat up over lower latitudes\ndue to more direct sunlight. Those that develop over land (continental) are\ndrier and hotter than those that develop over oceans (maritime), and travel\nnorthward on the western periphery of the subtropical ridge.[15] Maritime\ntropical air masses are sometimes referred to as trade air masses.[16] The one\nregion of the [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\") which has an absence of trade winds\nis the north [Indian ocean](/wiki/Indian_ocean \"Indian ocean\").[17]\n\n## Weather effects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trade_winds&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Weather effects\")]\n\nClouds which form above regions within trade wind regimes are typically\ncomposed of cumulus which extend no more than 4 kilometres (13,000 ft) in\nheight, and are capped from being taller by the trade wind inversion.[18]\nTrade winds originate more from the direction of the poles (northeast in the\nNorthern Hemisphere, southeast in the Southern Hemisphere) during the cold\nseason, and are stronger in the winter than the summer.[19] As an example, the\nwindy season in the [Guianas](/wiki/Guyana \"Guyana\"), which lie at low\nlatitudes in [South America](/wiki/South_America \"South America\"), occurs\nbetween January and April.[20] When the phase of the [Arctic\noscillation](/wiki/Arctic_oscillation \"Arctic oscillation\") (AO) is warm,\ntrade winds are stronger within the tropics. The cold phase of the AO leads to\nweaker trade winds.[21] When the trade winds are weaker, more extensive areas\nof rain fall upon landmasses within the tropics, such as [Central\nAmerica](/wiki/Central_America \"Central America\").[22]\n\nDuring mid-summer in the Northern Hemisphere (July), the westward-moving trade\nwinds south of the northward-moving [subtropical\nridge](/wiki/Subtropical_ridge \"Subtropical ridge\") expand northwestward from\nthe [Caribbean sea](/wiki/Caribbean_sea \"Caribbean sea\") into southeastern\nNorth America (Florida and Gulf Coast). When dust from the\n[Sahara](/wiki/Sahara \"Sahara\") moving around the southern periphery of the\nridge travels over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a\nblue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its\npresence negatively impacts [air quality](/wiki/Air_quality \"Air quality\") by\nadding to the count of airborne particulates.[23] Although the Southeast USA\nhas some of the cleanest air in North America, much of the African dust that\nreaches the United States affects Florida.[24] Since 1970, dust outbreaks have\nworsened due to periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in\nthe dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year.[25] Dust\nevents have been linked to a decline in the health of [coral\nreefs](/wiki/Coral_reef \"Coral reef\") across the Caribbean and Florida,\nprimarily since the 1970s.[26]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trade_winds&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Intertropical Convergence Zone](/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone \"Intertropical Convergence Zone\")\n  * [Volta do mar](/wiki/Volta_do_mar \"Volta do mar\")\n  * [Westerly wind burst](/wiki/Westerly_wind_burst \"Westerly wind burst\")\n  * [Winds in the Age of Sail](/wiki/Winds_in_the_Age_of_Sail \"Winds in the Age of Sail\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trade_winds&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Carol G.
