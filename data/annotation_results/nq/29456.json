In an attempt to flag down the [Georgia State\nPatrol](/wiki/Georgia_State_Patrol \"Georgia State Patrol\"), the man fires a\nwarning shot into the air, only to realize too late that the combination of\ncircumstances (the dead body, holding a gun and an audible gunshot) made him\nlook like the killer.\n\nThe sheriff arrests the man, a swift [show trial](/wiki/Show_trial \"Show\ntrial\") is held and the man is convicted and hanged in short order. In the\nsong's epilogue, the man's younger sister (singing in the [first\nperson](/wiki/First_person_narrative \"First person narrative\")) confesses that\nshe killed Andy as well as the man's wife, whose body was disposed where it\nwould never be found. The little sister blames the Georgia criminal justice\nsystem for her brother's death, warning in each chorus \"the judge in the\ntown's got blood stains on his hands.\"[1]\n\n## History and original\nrecording[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Night_the_Lights_Went_Out_in_Georgia&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History and original recording\")]\n\nAlthough Bobby Russell wrote both the lyrics and music for the song, he was\nreluctant to record even a demonstration because he \"didn't like it.\"\nAccording to Lawrence, who was married to Russell at the time, she believed it\nwas destined to be successful and recorded the demo herself. The publishers\nand the record label did not quite know how to pitch the song, as it was not\nreally a country or a pop song. The first thought was to offer the song to\nactress/singer [Liza Minnelli](/wiki/Liza_Minnelli \"Liza Minnelli\"), but\neventually it was offered to singer [Cher](/wiki/Cher \"Cher\"), but her then-\nhusband and manager [Sonny Bono](/wiki/Sonny_Bono \"Sonny Bono\") reportedly\nrefused it, as he was said to be concerned that the song might offend Cher's\nsouthern fans.[2] Without a singer to record the song, Lawrence went into a\nstudio and recorded it professionally herself, with the instrumental backing\nof L.A. session musicians from the [Wrecking\nCrew](/wiki/The_Wrecking_Crew_\\(music\\) \"The Wrecking Crew \\(music\\)\"),[3]\nthen pressed the label to release it as a single.\n\n## Release and\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Night_the_Lights_Went_Out_in_Georgia&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Release and reception\")]\n\nReleased as a single in June 1972, the song would ultimately become a number-\none success for Lawrence, topping the Hot 100 chart in early 1973. Lawrence\nwas, at the time, a regular performer on the ensemble variety comedy\ntelevision show _[The Carol Burnett Show](/wiki/The_Carol_Burnett_Show \"The\nCarol Burnett Show\")_. It scored number six on the [Easy\nListening](/wiki/Hot_Adult_Contemporary \"Hot Adult Contemporary\") chart,[4]\nand it peaked at number 36 on _Billboard '_s Hot Country Singles chart.[5] It\nwas number one for two weeks on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\"), and was finally topped by\n[Tony Orlando and Dawn](/wiki/Tony_Orlando_and_Dawn \"Tony Orlando and Dawn\")'s\n\"[Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak\nTree](/wiki/Tie_a_Yellow_Ribbon_Round_the_Ole_Oak_Tree \"Tie a Yellow Ribbon\nRound the Ole Oak Tree\")\". _Billboard_ ranked it as the [No. 11 song for\n1973](/wiki/Billboard_Year-End_Hot_100_singles_of_1973 \"Billboard Year-End Hot\n100 singles of 1973\").\n\nIn Canada, the single version scored number one, as well, topping the [_RPM_\n100](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\") national singles chart on May\n5 of the same year.[6] On the RPM Country Singles chart, it reached #25.[7]\n\n## Musical\nstructure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Night_the_Lights_Went_Out_in_Georgia&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Musical structure\")]\n\nThe lyrics use an AABCCB rhyming pattern on the verses, and ABCB on the\nchorus. The song's verses are in C [Dorian](/wiki/Dorian_mode \"Dorian mode\").\nVerse one consists of four lines, each using the chord pattern\nCm-B♭/C-Cm-F/C-Cm-Gm7-Cm. At the chorus, the song\n[modulates](/wiki/Modulation_\\(music\\) \"Modulation \\(music\\)\") to the key of\n[G major](/wiki/G_major \"G major\"), with a chord pattern of Am-D7-G-Em used\nthree times before ending on Am-D7-Gm.[8]\n\nVerse two uses the same structure as verse one, with an additional two lines.\nThe first additional lines also modulate to G major with a chord pattern of\nAm-D7-G-Em-Am-D-Gm, before returning to C Dorian for another repetition of the\noriginal chord pattern. After the second chorus, the third verse consists of\nonly two lines before the chorus is sung a third time. The song then ends with\na four-measure riff played in the key of [G minor](/wiki/G_minor \"G minor\").\nThe overall vocal range is G3-D5.[8]\n\n## Cover\nversions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Night_the_Lights_Went_Out_in_Georgia&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Cover versions\")]\n\n\"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\"  \n---  \n[Single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\") by [Reba\nMcEntire](/wiki/Reba_McEntire \"Reba McEntire\")  \nfrom the album _[For My Broken Heart](/wiki/For_My_Broken_Heart \"For My Broken\nHeart\")_  \n[B-side](/wiki/A-side_and_B-side \"A-side and B-side\") | \"All Dressed Up\"  \nReleased | April 1992  \nFormat | [7\" single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\")  \nRecorded | 1991  \n[Genre](/wiki/Music_genre \"Music genre\") | [Country](/wiki/Country_music \"Country music\")  \nLength | 4:17  \n[Label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\") | [MCA](/wiki/MCA_Records \"MCA Records\")  \n[Songwriter(s)](/wiki/Songwriter \"Songwriter\") | [Bobby Russell](/wiki/Bobby_Russell \"Bobby Russell\")  \n[Producer(s)](/wiki/Record_producer \"Record producer\") | [Tony Brown](/wiki/Tony_Brown_\\(record_producer\\) \"Tony Brown \\(record producer\\)\"), Reba McEntire  \n[Reba McEntire](/wiki/Reba_McEntire \"Reba McEntire\") singles chronology  \n| \"[Is There Life Out There](/wiki/Is_There_Life_Out_There \"Is There Life Out\nThere\")\"  \n(1992) | \"**The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia** \"  \n(1992) | \"[The Greatest Man I Never Knew](/wiki/The_Greatest_Man_I_Never_Knew \"The Greatest Man I Never Knew\")\"  \n(1992)  \n---|---|---  \n| \"[Is There Life Out There](/wiki/Is_There_Life_Out_There \"Is There Life Out\nThere\")\"  \n(1992) | \"**The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia** \"  \n(1992) | \"[The Greatest Man I Never Knew](/wiki/The_Greatest_Man_I_Never_Knew \"The Greatest Man I Never Knew\")\"  \n(1992)  \n---|---|---  \n  \n### Tanya Tucker\ncover[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Night_the_Lights_Went_Out_in_Georgia&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Tanya Tucker cover\")]\n\nIn 1981, country singer [Tanya Tucker](/wiki/Tanya_Tucker \"Tanya Tucker\")\nrecorded a version (on an album of the same name) with differing lyrics and an\naltered timeline. These altered lyrics were based on the plot line of the 1981\nmovie _[The Night the Lights Went Out in\nGeorgia](/wiki/The_Night_the_Lights_Went_Out_in_Georgia_\\(film\\) \"The Night\nthe Lights Went Out in Georgia \\(film\\)\")_.\n\n### Reba McEntire\ncover[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Night_the_Lights_Went_Out_in_Georgia&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Reba McEntire cover\")]\n\nDuring 1991, the song was sung as a cover version by [Reba\nMcEntire](/wiki/Reba_McEntire \"Reba McEntire\") on her album _For My Broken\nHeart_. It reached number 12 on _Billboard '_s Hot Country Songs chart. While\nstill a commercially successful release, this broke a string of 24 consecutive\ntop 10 country singles by McEntire.\n\nThe song also had a successful music video, wherein the older brother of the\nstory is given the name \"Raymond Brody\"; the video for McEntire's version also\ncontained spoken dialogue that expanded on several of the song's plot points,\nby suggesting that the judge knew that the narrator's brother did not commit\nthe crime, but was nonetheless anxious to convict him, since he, himself (the\njudge) had also been having sex with the wife (played by\n[Playboy](/wiki/Playboy \"Playboy\") centerfold/pin up model [Barbara\nMoore](/wiki/Barbara_Moore_\\(model\\) \"Barbara Moore \\(model\\)\")) and was\nworried that a long, involved trial would cause this fact to become known. It\nalso establishes that the little sister (played by McEntire, and portrayed\nboth as a young woman in flashbacks and as a 60-year-old woman using heavy\nmakeup) caught Andy in the act with her brother's wife and that the unfaithful\nwoman also had an affair with the sister's own fiancé.\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Night_the_Lights_Went_Out_in_Georgia&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: In popular culture\")]\n\n  * For a 1986 _[Designing Women](/wiki/Designing_Women \"Designing Women\")_ episode, main character [Julia Sugarbaker](/wiki/Julia_Sugarbaker \"Julia Sugarbaker\") ([Dixie Carter](/wiki/Dixie_Carter_\\(actress\\) \"Dixie Carter \\(actress\\)\")) has one of her famous tirades, defending her beauty queen sister Suzanne against catty remarks made by a young woman, concluding with \"And _that_ , just so you will know, and your children will someday know, was the night the lights went out in Georgia!\"\n  * It is a prime example of a [twist ending](/wiki/Twist_ending \"Twist ending\") in a song, and in the 1992 film _[Reservoir Dogs](/wiki/Reservoir_Dogs \"Reservoir Dogs\")_ , one of the mobsters in the film named [Nice Guy Eddie](/wiki/Nice_Guy_Eddie \"Nice Guy Eddie\") says \"...this is the first time I ever realized that the girl singin' the song is the one who shot Andy.\"\n  * The opening motif is sampled in [\"The Time Is Now\"](/wiki/The_Time_Is_Now_\\(John_Cena_song\\) \"The Time Is Now \\(John Cena song\\)\"), which is currently used as American professional wrestler [John Cena](/wiki/John_Cena \"John Cena\")'s entrance music; specifically, the song samples Pete Schofield and The Canadians' rendition.\n  * In 2011, a book was released titled \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia,\" written by Jeremy G.T.
