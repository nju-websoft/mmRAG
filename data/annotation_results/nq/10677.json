Cantrell** (aged 86) on February 2, 1934, when she was\n19. Cantrell had enlisted in the [Confederate States\nArmy](/wiki/Confederate_States_Army \"Confederate States Army\") at age 16 in\n[Pikeville, Kentucky](/wiki/Pikeville,_Kentucky \"Pikeville, Kentucky\"), and\nserved in General [Samuel G. French's](/wiki/Samuel_G._French \"Samuel G.\nFrench\") Battalion of Virginia Infantry. He was captured in 1863, and was part\nof a [prisoner exchange](/wiki/Prisoner_exchange \"Prisoner exchange\"). He had\na previous wife, who had died in 1929. Cantrell supported her with a\n[pension](/wiki/Pension \"Pension\") of US$25 every two or three months, and she\ninherited his home in 1937. She received no further pension benefits after his\ndeath. She remarried later in 1937, and twice thereafter, and had three\nchildren.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIt was not especially uncommon for young women in Arkansas to marry\nConfederate pensioners; in 1937 the state passed a law stating that women who\nmarried Civil War veterans would not be eligible for a [widow's\npension](/wiki/Widow%27s_pension \"Widow's pension\"). The law was later changed\nin 1939 to state that widows born after 1870 were not eligible for pensions.\nHopkins generally kept her first marriage a secret, fearing that the resulting\ngossip (of marrying a much older man) would damage her reputation.[1]\n\nAfter researching records from Arkansas and [United States Census\nBureau](/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau \"United States Census Bureau\") data,\nHopkins was certified by various historical organizations, most notably the\n[United Daughters of the\nConfederacy](/wiki/United_Daughters_of_the_Confederacy \"United Daughters of\nthe Confederacy\"). A spokeswoman for the UDC, Martha Boltz, has said that\nthere may be two other widows, one in [Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee \"Tennessee\")\nand another in [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North Carolina\"), but if\nthey are still alive, they choose to remain in anonymity.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nMaudie Hopkins died on August 17, 2008, in a nursing home in [Lexa,\nArkansas](/wiki/Lexa,_Arkansas \"Lexa, Arkansas\"), aged 93.[2]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maudie_Hopkins&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Alberta Martin](/wiki/Alberta_Martin \"Alberta Martin\"), one of the last known Confederate war widows and the last widow whose marriage to a Confederate soldier produced offspring.
