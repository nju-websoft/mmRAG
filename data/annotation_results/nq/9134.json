The _Bronze Fonz_ depicts [Henry\nWinkler](/wiki/Henry_Winkler \"Henry Winkler\") as the _[Happy\nDays](/wiki/Happy_Days \"Happy Days\")_ TV show character Arthur Fonzarelli,\nalso known as [the Fonz](/wiki/Fonzie \"Fonzie\").[1] Fonzie stands in his\ntypical costume, which consists of a leather jacket and jeans. He is giving a\ntwo-handed [thumbs up](/wiki/Thumbs_signal \"Thumbs signal\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Description\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 Opposition\n    * 2.2 Acquisition\n  * 3 In popular culture\n  * 4 References\n\n## Description[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bronze_Fonz&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Description\")]\n\nThe _Bronze Fonz_ is made of [bronze](/wiki/Bronze \"Bronze\"). The sculpture\ndepicts Henry Winkler, the actor who played Fonz in the show _Happy Days_.\n_Happy Days_ , which aired in the 1970s, was a sitcom about a family in\n1950s/1960s Milwaukee. Arthur Fonzarelli (also known as \"Fonzie\" or \"The\nFonz\"), wears a leather jacket and jeans. He is giving a two handed thumbs up,\na gesture he often made in _Happy Days_. The inscription lists all of the\ndonors that made the _Bronze Fonz_ possible.\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bronze_Fonz&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nThe artwork was created with the purpose of bringing tourism and new\nbusinesses to Milwaukee. Other places in the United States have erected\nstatues portraying 1950s and 1960s television characters. Examples include:\nMary Tyler Moore as Mary Richards from _[The Mary Tyler Moore\nShow](/wiki/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\")_ in\nMinneapolis and Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden from _[The\nHoneymooners](/wiki/The_Honeymooners \"The Honeymooners\")_ outside the [Port\nAuthority Bus Terminal](/wiki/Port_Authority_Bus_Terminal \"Port Authority Bus\nTerminal\") in Manhattan. The tourism group Visit Milwaukee raised over\nUS$85,000 to commission the _Bronze Fonz_. The popular sculpture was unveiled\non August 18, 2008. Most of the _Happy Days_ cast, including [Henry\nWinkler](/wiki/Henry_Winkler \"Henry Winkler\") (Fonzie) [Marion\nRoss](/wiki/Marion_Ross \"Marion Ross\") (Mrs. Cunningham), [Tom\nBosley](/wiki/Tom_Bosley \"Tom Bosley\") (Mr. Cunningham), [Erin\nMoran](/wiki/Erin_Moran \"Erin Moran\") (Joanie), [Don Most](/wiki/Don_Most \"Don\nMost\") (Ralph Malph), and [Anson Williams](/wiki/Anson_Williams \"Anson\nWilliams\") (Potsie), attended the dedication ceremony. Henry Winkler stated\nthat the statue was \"unbelievable\".[2]\n\n### Opposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bronze_Fonz&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Opposition\")]\n\nMike Brenner, then a local gallery owner and executive director of Milwaukee\nArtist Resource Network (MARN), objected to the statue, which was originally\nplanned to be located at the intersection of Wisconsin and Water Streets, a\nprominent downtown site. He threatened to close his gallery, Hotcakes, and\nresign as executive director of MARN if \"that stupid Fonzie sculpture\" was\nerected there.[3] Brenner received death threats for voicing against the\nBronze Fonz and posted several on his web site.[4] The CEO of the [Milwaukee\nArt Museum](/wiki/Milwaukee_Art_Museum \"Milwaukee Art Museum\"), David Gordon,\nalong with Mary-Louise Schumacher, arts critic for the _[Milwaukee Journal\nSentinel](/wiki/Milwaukee_Journal_Sentinel \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\")_ ,\nand other Milwaukee arts dignitaries also opposed the statue. It was\neventually relocated to the Riverwalk site. Brenner indeed closed Hotcakes\nGallery in May 2008, and has since become a [microbrewer](/wiki/Microbrewery\n\"Microbrewery\"), remaining in Milwaukee.[5][6]\n\n### Acquisition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bronze_Fonz&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Acquisition\")]\n\nThe piece was commissioned by Visit Milwaukee, a non-profit group that works\ntoward making Milwaukee a place for tourism and interest. Visit Milwaukee\nraised $85,000 to commission the statue.[1]\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bronze_Fonz&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: In popular culture\")]\n\nThe statue is referenced in the lyrics of the 2014 song \"Milwaukee\" by [The\nBoth](/wiki/The_Both \"The Both\").[7] The song, which recounted the local\norigin of the collaboration between the duo of [Aimee Mann](/wiki/Aimee_Mann\n\"Aimee Mann\") and [Ted Leo](/wiki/Ted_Leo \"Ted Leo\"), was the first single\nfrom their [self-titled debut album](/wiki/The_Both \"The Both\").[8]\n\nMentioned in the cozy mystery novel - In the Drink by Allyson K. Abbott.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bronze_Fonz&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [\"The Fonz in bronze?
