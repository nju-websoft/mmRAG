He received a bass guitar from his\nfather on his 12th birthday and performed in a local band.[2] After receiving\nan acoustic guitar as a gift from his uncle, Rowe began playing solo.[1]\n\nHe wrote his first song at the age of seven on a [Fisher-Price](/wiki/Fisher-\nPrice \"Fisher-Price\") typewriter after listening to\n[Survivor](/wiki/Survivor_\\(band\\) \"Survivor \\(band\\)\")'s \"[Eye of the\nTiger](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Tiger \"Eye of the Tiger\").\"[3] Rowe started seriously\nwriting songs when he was 18.[3][4] The first complete song that he wrote was\ncalled \"Turtle,\" which was inspired by his friend and singer-songwriter Jeanne\nFrench.[3]\n\nAt the age of 17, Rowe discovered [Otis Redding](/wiki/Otis_Redding \"Otis\nRedding\") and his song \"Open The Door\", which inspired him to begin\nsinging.[3][5]\n\n##\nNature[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sean_Rowe&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Nature\")]\n\nAn avid naturalist, Rowe often speaks of his fascination with the woods and\nhis connection to the land.[1][6][7][8]\n\nAfter reading _The Tracker_ by [Tom Brown](/wiki/Tom_Brown_\\(naturalist\\) \"Tom\nBrown \\(naturalist\\)\") at the age of 18, Rowe started a blog about his\nexperiences in the wilderness.[4][6][9] He later took courses at [Tom\nBrown](/wiki/Tom_Brown_\\(naturalist\\) \"Tom Brown \\(naturalist\\)\")'s Wilderness\nSurvival School in Asbury, NJ.\n\nIn 2006, Rowe studied for a year at Hawk Circle Wilderness Education in Cherry\nValley, NY, and completed a 24-day solo survival quest after his\ntraining.[1][6]\n\nRowe also studied under wild food author and expert, Samuel Thayer, and has\npartnered with Kawing Crow Awareness Center as a guest instructor for\nwilderness survival workshops and wild edible plant foraging.[6]\n\nSince 2009, Rowe has contributed as a blogger to the Albany Times Union on\ntopics concerning nature, wildlife and his music career.[6]\n\n##\nCareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sean_Rowe&action=edit&section=3&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Career\")]\n\nSince 2003, Rowe played locally in his hometown at open mics, bars and\ncafes.[10] He began playing with percussionist Marco Haber, who played on a\nfew tracks on his first album \"27\". Shortly thereafter they began playing\nunder the name Mudfunk and recorded a live album, _Live at the Grind_ , as\nwell as a single of \"Wrong Side of the Bed.\" The latter would be re-recorded\nfor Sean's solo album, _Magic_ , without Haber and with different\ninstrumentation. He recorded his album, _Magic,_ at Collar City Sound and\nreleased it through Collar City Records on April 21, 2009.[1][6] In 2009, Rowe\nwas asked to open for [Noah and the Whale](/wiki/Noah_and_the_Whale \"Noah and\nthe Whale\") in the United Kingdom.[1] Soon after, Sean signed with\n[ANTI-](/wiki/ANTI- \"ANTI-\") Records, which re-released _Magic_ on February\n22, 2011,[11] and released _The Salesman and the Shark_ on August 28, 2012. On\nMarch 4, Sean played his new release, \"Downwind\", on Jimmy Kimmel Live.
