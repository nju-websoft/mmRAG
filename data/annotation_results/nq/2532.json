This misconception was based on the misbelief\nthat the Cape was the dividing point between the\n[Atlantic](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean \"Atlantic Ocean\") and [Indian\nOceans](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian Ocean\"). Contemporary geographic knowledge\ninstead states the southernmost point of Africa is [Cape\nAgulhas](/wiki/Cape_Agulhas \"Cape Agulhas\") about 150 kilometres (90 mi) to\nthe [east-southeast](/wiki/East-southeast \"East-southeast\").[2] The currents\nof the two oceans meet at the point where the warm-water [Agulhas\ncurrent](/wiki/Agulhas_current \"Agulhas current\") meets the cold-water\n[Benguela current](/wiki/Benguela_current \"Benguela current\") and turns back\non itself. That oceanic meeting point fluctuates between Cape Agulhas and\n[Cape Point](/wiki/Cape_Point \"Cape Point\") (about 1.2 kilometres (0.75 mi)\neast of the Cape of Good Hope).\n\n[Wikimedia](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Maps_Terms_of_Use) | © [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)\n\nThe Cape of Good Hope is at the southern tip of the [Cape\nPeninsula](/wiki/Cape_Peninsula \"Cape Peninsula\") approximately 50 km (31 mi)\nsouth of [Cape Town](/wiki/Cape_Town \"Cape Town\"), [South\nAfrica](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\").\n\nWhen following the western side of the African coastline from the equator,\nhowever, the Cape of Good Hope marks the point where a ship begins to travel\nmore eastward than southward. Thus, the first modern rounding of the cape in\n1488 by [Portuguese](/wiki/Portuguese_discoveries \"Portuguese discoveries\")\nexplorer [Bartolomeu Dias](/wiki/Bartolomeu_Dias \"Bartolomeu Dias\") was a\nmilestone in the attempts by the Portuguese to establish direct trade\nrelations with the [Far East](/wiki/Far_East \"Far East\") (although\n[Herodotus](/wiki/Herodotus \"Herodotus\") mentioned a claim that the\n[Phoenicians](/wiki/Phoenicia \"Phoenicia\") had done so [far\nearlier](/wiki/Necho_II#Phoenician_expedition \"Necho II\")).[3] Dias called the\ncape _Cabo das Tormentas_ (\"Cape of Storms\"; [Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_language\n\"Dutch language\"): _Stormkaap_), which was the original name of the \"Cape of\nGood Hope\".[4]\n\nAs one of the [great capes](/wiki/Great_capes \"Great capes\") of the South\nAtlantic Ocean, the Cape of Good Hope has long been of special significance to\nsailors, many of whom refer to it simply as \"**the Cape** \".[5] It is a\n[waypoint](/wiki/Waypoint \"Waypoint\") on the [Cape Route](/wiki/Cape_Route\n\"Cape Route\") and the [clipper route](/wiki/Clipper_route \"Clipper route\")\nfollowed by [clipper ships](/wiki/Clipper_ship \"Clipper ship\") to the [Far\nEast](/wiki/Far_East \"Far East\") and [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"),\nand still followed by several offshore [yacht races](/wiki/Yacht_racing \"Yacht\nracing\").\n\nThe term _Cape of Good Hope_ is also used in three other ways:\n\n  * It is a section of the [Table Mountain National Park](/wiki/Table_Mountain_National_Park \"Table Mountain National Park\"), within which the cape of the same name, as well as [Cape Point](/wiki/Cape_Point \"Cape Point\"), falls. Prior to its incorporation into the national park, this section constituted the Cape Point Nature Reserve.[6]\n  * It was the name of the early [Cape Colony](/wiki/Cape_Colony \"Cape Colony\") established by the Dutch in 1652, on the [Cape Peninsula](/wiki/Cape_Peninsula \"Cape Peninsula\").\n  * Just before the [Union of South Africa](/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa \"Union of South Africa\") was formed, the term referred to the entire region that in 1910 was to become the [Cape of Good Hope Province](/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope_Province \"Cape of Good Hope Province\") (usually shortened to _the Cape Province_).\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Geography\n  * 3 Fauna\n    * 3.1 Chacma baboons\n  * 4 Flora\n  * 5 Legends\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_of_Good_Hope&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[Eudoxus of Cyzicus](/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cyzicus \"Eudoxus of Cyzicus\")\n([/ˈjuːdəksəs/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\");\n[Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\"): Εὔδοξος, _Eúdoxos_ ; fl. c.\n130 BC) was a [Greek](/wiki/Ethnic_Greek \"Ethnic Greek\")\n[navigator](/wiki/Navigator \"Navigator\") for [Ptolemy\nVIII](/wiki/Ptolemy_VIII_Physcon \"Ptolemy VIII Physcon\"), king of the\n[Hellenistic](/wiki/Hellenistic_civilization \"Hellenistic civilization\")\n[Ptolemaic dynasty](/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty \"Ptolemaic dynasty\") in\n[Egypt](/wiki/Egypt \"Egypt\"), who found the wreck of a ship in the [Indian\nOcean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian Ocean\") that appeared to have come from\n[Gades](/wiki/C%C3%A1diz \"Cádiz\") (today's [Cádiz](/wiki/C%C3%A1diz \"Cádiz\")\nin Spain), rounding the Cape.\n\nWhen Eudoxus was returning from his second voyage to India the wind forced him\nsouth of the [Gulf of Aden](/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden \"Gulf of Aden\") and down the\ncoast of Africa for some distance. Somewhere along the coast of East Africa,\nhe found the remains of the ship. Due to its appearance and the story told by\nthe natives, Eudoxus concluded that the ship was from Gades and had sailed\nanti-clockwise around Africa, passing the Cape and entering the Indian Ocean.\nThis inspired him to repeat the voyage and attempt a\n[circumnavigation](/wiki/Circumnavigation \"Circumnavigation\") of the\ncontinent. Organising the expedition on his own account he set sail from Gades\nand began to work down the African coast. The difficulties were too great,\nhowever, and he was obliged to return to Europe.[7]\n\nAfter this failure he again set out to circumnavigate Africa. His eventual\nfate is unknown. Although some, such as [Pliny](/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder \"Pliny\nthe Elder\"), claimed that Eudoxus did achieve his goal, the most probable\nconclusion is that he perished on the journey.[8]\n\nIn the 1450 [Fra Mauro map](/wiki/Fra_Mauro_map \"Fra Mauro map\"), the Indian\nOcean is depicted as connected to the Atlantic. Fra Mauro puts the following\ninscription by the southern tip of Africa, which he names the \"Cape of Diab\",\ndescribing the exploration by a ship from the East around 1420:[9][10]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/FraMauroChineseShip.jpg/220px-\nFraMauroChineseShip.jpg)](/wiki/File:FraMauroChineseShip.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:FraMauroChineseShip.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDetail of the Fra Mauro Map describing the construction of the junks that\nnavigate in the Indian Ocean.\n\n> \"Around 1420 a ship, or junk, from India crossed the Sea of India towards\n> the Island of Men and the Island of Women, off Cape Diab, between the Green\n> Islands and the shadows. It sailed for 40 days in a south-westerly direction\n> without ever finding anything other than wind and water. According to these\n> people themselves, the ship went some 2,000 miles ahead until - once\n> favourable conditions came to an end - it turned round and sailed back to\n> Cape Diab in 70 days\".\n\n> \"The ships called junks (lit. \"Zonchi\") that navigate these seas carry four\n> masts or more, some of which can be raised or lowered, and have 40 to 60\n> cabins for the merchants and only one tiller. They can navigate without a\n> [compass](/wiki/Compass \"Compass\"), because they have an\n> [astrologer](/wiki/Astrologer \"Astrologer\"), who stands on the side and,\n> with an [astrolabe](/wiki/Astrolabe \"Astrolabe\") in hand, gives orders to\n> the navigator\". (Text from the Fra Mauro map, 09-P25.)\n\nFra Mauro explained that he obtained the information from \"a trustworthy\nsource\", who traveled with the expedition, possibly the Venetian explorer\n[Niccolò da Conti](/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_da_Conti \"Niccolò da Conti\") who\nhappened to be in [Calicut](/wiki/Kozhikode \"Kozhikode\"), [India](/wiki/India\n\"India\") at the time the expedition left:\n\n> \"What is more, I have spoken with a person worthy of trust, who says that he\n> sailed in an Indian ship caught in the fury of a tempest for 40 days out in\n> the Sea of India, beyond the [Cape of Soffala](/wiki/Sofala \"Sofala\") and\n> the Green Islands towards west-southwest; and according to the astrologers\n> who act as their guides, they had advanced almost 2,000 miles. Thus one can\n> believe and confirm what is said by both these and those, and that they had\n> therefore sailed 4,000 miles\".\n\nFra Mauro also comments that the account of the expedition, together with the\nrelation by [Strabo](/wiki/Strabo \"Strabo\") of the travels of [Eudoxus of\nCyzicus](/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cyzicus \"Eudoxus of Cyzicus\") from\n[Arabia](/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula \"Arabian Peninsula\") to\n[Gibraltar](/wiki/Gibraltar \"Gibraltar\") through the southern Ocean in\n[Antiquity](/wiki/Classical_antiquity \"Classical antiquity\"), led him to\nbelieve that the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian Ocean\") was not a\nclosed sea and that [Africa](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\") could be circumnavigated\nby her southern end (Text from Fra Mauro map, 11, G2). This knowledge,\ntogether with the map depiction of the African continent, probably encouraged\nthe Portuguese to intensify their effort to round the tip of Africa.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Cape_Peninsula.jpg/300px-\nCape_Peninsula.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cape_Peninsula.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cape_Peninsula.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMap showing the [Cape Peninsula](/wiki/Cape_Peninsula \"Cape Peninsula\"),\nillustrating the position of the Cape of Good Hope.

It was later renamed by [John II\nof Portugal](/wiki/John_II_of_Portugal \"John II of Portugal\") as \"Cape of Good\nHope\" (_Cabo da Boa Esperança_) because of the great optimism engendered by\nthe opening of a sea route to [India](/wiki/India \"India\") and the East.\n\nThe [Khoikhoi](/wiki/Khoikhoi \"Khoikhoi\") people lived in the cape area when\nthe Dutch first settled there in 1652. The Khoikhoi had arrived in this area\nabout fifteen hundred years before.[11] The Dutch called them\n[Hottentots](/wiki/Khoikhoi \"Khoikhoi\"), a term that has now come to be\nregarded as pejorative.\n\n[Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_people \"Dutch people\") colonial administrator [Jan van\nRiebeeck](/wiki/Jan_van_Riebeeck \"Jan van Riebeeck\") established a resupply\ncamp for the [Dutch East India Company](/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company \"Dutch\nEast India Company\") some 50 km north of the cape in [Table\nBay](/wiki/Table_Bay \"Table Bay\") on 6 April 1652 and this eventually\ndeveloped into [Cape Town](/wiki/Cape_Town \"Cape Town\"). Supplies of fresh\nfood were vital on the long journey around Africa and Cape Town became known\nas \"The Tavern of the Seas\".\n\nOn 31 December 1687 a community of [Huguenots](/wiki/Huguenots \"Huguenots\")\n(French Protestants) arrived at the Cape of Good Hope from the Netherlands.\nThey had escaped from France and fled to the Netherlands to flee religious\npersecution in France. One example was Pierre Joubert who came from [La\nMotte-d'Aigues](/wiki/La_Motte-d%27Aigues \"La Motte-d'Aigues\"). The Dutch East\nIndia Company needed skilled farmers at the Cape of Good Hope and the Dutch\nGovernment saw opportunities to settle Huguenots at the Cape and sent them\nthere. The Cape colony gradually grew over the next 150 years or so until it\nstretched for hundreds of kilometres to the north and north-east.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the Dutch Republic was occupied by the French in\n1795. Thus the Cape Colony became a French vassal and enemy of the British.\nTherefore, the United Kingdom invaded and occupied the Cape Colony that same\nyear. The British relinquished control of the territory in 1803 but returned\nand reoccupied the Colony on 19 January 1806 following the [Battle of\nBlaauwberg](/wiki/Battle_of_Blaauwberg \"Battle of Blaauwberg\"). The Dutch\nceded the territory to the British in the [Anglo-Dutch Treaty of\n1814](/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_of_1814 \"Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814\") The Cape\nwas then administered as the [Cape Colony](/wiki/Cape_Colony \"Cape Colony\")\nand it remained a British colony until it was incorporated into the\nindependent [Union of South Africa](/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa \"Union of\nSouth Africa\") in 1910 (now known as the Republic of South Africa).\n\nThe Portuguese government erected two navigational beacons, **Dias Cross** and\n**Gama Cross** , to commemorate [Vasco da Gama](/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama \"Vasco da\nGama\") and [Bartolomeu Dias](/wiki/Bartolomeu_Dias \"Bartolomeu Dias\") as\nexplorers who as mentioned were the first explorers to reach the cape.

[Cape Town](/wiki/Cape_Town \"Cape Town\") is about 50\nkilometres to the north of the Cape, in [Table Bay](/wiki/Table_Bay \"Table\nBay\") at the north end of the peninsula. The peninsula forms the western\nboundary of [False Bay](/wiki/False_Bay \"False Bay\"). Geologically, the rocks\nfound at the two capes, and indeed over much of the peninsula, are part of the\n[Cape Supergroup](/wiki/Cape_Peninsula#Geology \"Cape Peninsula\"), and are\nformed of the same type of sandstones as [Table\nMountain](/wiki/Table_Mountain_\\(South_Africa\\) \"Table Mountain \\(South\nAfrica\\)\") itself.

There is a difference\nbetween the sea life west of Cape Point and that to the east due to the\nmarkedly differing sea temperatures.\n\nThe South African Marine Living Resources Act is strictly enforced throughout\nthe [Table Mountain National Park](/wiki/Table_Mountain_National_Park \"Table\nMountain National Park\"), and especially in marine protected areas.\nDisturbance or removal of any marine organisms is strictly prohibited between\nSchusters Bay and Hoek van Bobbejaan, but is allowed in other areas during\nseason and with relevant permits.\n\n### Chacma\nbaboons[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_of_Good_Hope&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Chacma baboons\")]\n\nChacma baboons (_[Papio ursinus](/wiki/Papio_ursinus \"Papio ursinus\")_) are\nthe mammals most intimately associated with the Cape of Good Hope. Baboons\ninside the Cape of Good Hope section of the park are a major tourist\nattraction. There are 11 troops consisting of about 375 individuals throughout\nthe entire Cape Peninsula. Six of these 11 troops either live entirely within\nthe Cape of Good Hope section of the park, or use the section as part of their\nrange. The Cape Point, Kanonkop, Klein Olifantsbos, and Buffels Bay troops\nlive entirely inside the Cape of Good Hope section of the Park. The Groot\nOlifantsbos and Plateau Road troops range into the park.\n\nChacma baboons are widely distributed across southern Africa and are\nclassified as ″least concern\" in the [_IUCN Red List of Threatened\nSpecies_](http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/full/16022/0).\nHowever, the South African Parks Department states in its publication\n_Mountains in the Sea_ that the baboon population on the Cape is \"critically\nendangered.\" This is due to habitat loss, genetic isolation, and conflicts\nwith humans. Cape baboons have been eliminated from the majority of their\nrange across the Cape Peninsula, and the Cape of Good Hope section of Table\nMountain National Park provides a sanctuary for the troops that live within\nits boundaries. It provides relative safety from nearby towns, where people\nhave killed many baboons after the baboons raid their houses looking for food.\nBaboons are also frequently injured or killed outside of the park by cars and\nby electrocution on power lines. Inside the park, some management policies\nsuch as allowing barbecues and picnics in the baboon home ranges cause\ndetriment to the troops, as they become embroiled in conflicts with guests to\nthe park.\n\n## Flora[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_of_Good_Hope&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Flora\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Flora_at_Cape_Peninsula.JPG/220px-\nFlora_at_Cape_Peninsula.JPG)](/wiki/File:Flora_at_Cape_Peninsula.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Flora_at_Cape_Peninsula.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Fynbos](/wiki/Fynbos \"Fynbos\") at Cape Peninsula\n\nThe Cape of Good Hope is an integral part of the [Cape Floristic\nKingdom](/wiki/Cape_Floristic_Kingdom \"Cape Floristic Kingdom\"), the smallest\nbut richest of the world's six floral kingdoms.
