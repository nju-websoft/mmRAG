Its nucleus was called the **Army of\nNortheastern Virginia** , under [Brig.\nGen.](/wiki/Brigadier_general_\\(United_States\\) \"Brigadier general \\(United\nStates\\)\") [Irvin McDowell](/wiki/Irvin_McDowell \"Irvin McDowell\"), and it was\nthe army that fought (and lost) the war's first major battle, the [First\nBattle of Bull Run](/wiki/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run \"First Battle of Bull\nRun\"). The arrival in [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington,\nD.C.\"), of [Maj. Gen.](/wiki/Major_general_\\(United_States\\) \"Major general\n\\(United States\\)\") [George B. McClellan](/wiki/George_B._McClellan \"George B.\nMcClellan\") dramatically changed the makeup of that army. McClellan's original\nassignment was to command the [Division of the\nPotomac](/w/index.php?title=Division_of_the_Potomac&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Division of the Potomac \\(page does not exist\\)\"), which included the\n[Department of Northeast\nVirginia](/w/index.php?title=Department_of_Northeast_Virginia&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Department of Northeast Virginia \\(page does not exist\\)\") under McDowell and\nthe [Department of Washington](/wiki/Department_of_Washington \"Department of\nWashington\") under Brig. Gen. [Joseph K. Mansfield](/wiki/Joseph_K._Mansfield\n\"Joseph K. Mansfield\"). On July 26, 1861, the [Department of the\nShenandoah](/wiki/Department_of_the_Shenandoah \"Department of the\nShenandoah\"), commanded by Maj. Gen. [Nathaniel P.\nBanks](/wiki/Nathaniel_P._Banks \"Nathaniel P. Banks\"), was merged with\nMcClellan's departments and on that day, McClellan formed the Army of the\nPotomac, which was composed of all military forces in the former Departments\nof Northeastern Virginia, Washington,\n[Pennsylvania](/wiki/Department_of_Pennsylvania \"Department of Pennsylvania\"),\nand the Shenandoah. The men under Banks's command became an infantry division\nin the Army of the Potomac.[1] The army started with four corps, but these\nwere divided during the [Peninsula Campaign](/wiki/Peninsula_Campaign\n\"Peninsula Campaign\") to produce two more. After the [Second Battle of Bull\nRun](/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Bull_Run \"Second Battle of Bull Run\"), the Army of\nthe Potomac absorbed the units that had served under Maj. Gen. [John\nPope](/wiki/John_Pope_\\(military_officer\\) \"John Pope \\(military officer\\)\").\n\nIt is a popular, but mistaken, belief that John Pope commanded the Army of the\nPotomac in the summer of 1862 after McClellan's unsuccessful Peninsula\nCampaign. On the contrary, Pope's army consisted of different units, and was\nnamed the [Army of Virginia](/wiki/Army_of_Virginia \"Army of Virginia\").\nDuring the time that the Army of Virginia existed, the Army of the Potomac was\nheadquartered on the [Virginia Peninsula](/wiki/Virginia_Peninsula \"Virginia\nPeninsula\"), and then outside Washington, D.C., with McClellan still in\ncommand, although three corps of the Army of the Potomac were sent to northern\nVirginia and were under Pope's operational control during the [Northern\nVirginia Campaign](/wiki/Northern_Virginia_Campaign \"Northern Virginia\nCampaign\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/The_Army_of_the_Potomac_\n--_Our_Outlying_Picket_in_the_Woods.jpg/220px-The_Army_of_the_Potomac_--\n_Our_Outlying_Picket_in_the_Woods.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Army_of_the_Potomac_--\n_Our_Outlying_Picket_in_the_Woods.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Army_of_the_Potomac_--_Our_Outlying_Picket_in_the_Woods.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n_The Army of the Potomac – Our Outlying Picket in the Woods_ , 1862\n\nThe Army of the Potomac underwent many structural changes during its\nexistence. The army was divided by [Ambrose Burnside](/wiki/Ambrose_Burnside\n\"Ambrose Burnside\") into three grand divisions of two corps each with a\nReserve composed of two more. Hooker abolished the grand divisions. Thereafter\nthe individual corps, seven of which remained in Virginia, reported directly\nto army headquarters. Hooker also created a Cavalry Corps by combining units\nthat previously had served as smaller formations. In late 1863, two corps were\nsent West, and— in 1864— the remaining five corps were recombined into three.\nBurnside's [IX Corps](/wiki/IX_Corps_\\(ACW\\) \"IX Corps \\(ACW\\)\"), which\naccompanied the army at the start of [Ulysses S. Grant](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant\n\"Ulysses S. Grant\")'s [Overland Campaign](/wiki/Overland_Campaign \"Overland\nCampaign\"), rejoined the army later. For more detail, see the section\n**Corps** below.\n\nThe Army of the Potomac fought in most of the Eastern Theater campaigns,\nprimarily in (Eastern) Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. After the end of\nthe war, it was disbanded on June 28, 1865, shortly following its\nparticipation in the [Grand Review of the\nArmies](/wiki/Grand_Review_of_the_Armies \"Grand Review of the Armies\").\n\nThe **Army of the Potomac** was also the name given to General [P. G. T.\nBeauregard](/wiki/P._G._T._Beauregard \"P. G. T. Beauregard\")'s\n[Confederate](/wiki/Confederate_States_Army \"Confederate States Army\") army\nduring the early stages of the war (namely, First Bull Run; thus, the losing\nUnion Army ended up adopting the name of the winning Confederate army).\nHowever, the name was eventually changed to the [Army of Northern\nVirginia](/wiki/Army_of_Northern_Virginia \"Army of Northern Virginia\"), which\nbecame famous under General [Robert E. Lee](/wiki/Robert_E._Lee \"Robert E.\nLee\").\n\nIn 1869 the [Society of the Army of the\nPotomac](/wiki/Society_of_the_Army_of_the_Potomac \"Society of the Army of the\nPotomac\") was formed as a veterans association. It had its last reunion in\n1929.\n\n## Famous\nunits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Army_of_the_Potomac&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Famous units\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Civil_War_steeplechase2.jpg/220px-\nCivil_War_steeplechase2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Civil_War_steeplechase2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Civil_War_steeplechase2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Saint Patrick's Day](/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Day \"Saint Patrick's Day\")\ncelebration in the Army of the Potomac, depicting a\n[steeplechase](/wiki/Steeplechase_\\(horse_racing\\) \"Steeplechase \\(horse\nracing\\)\") race among the [Irish Brigade](/wiki/Irish_Brigade_\\(U.S.\\) \"Irish\nBrigade \\(U.S.\\)\"), March 17, 1863, by [Edwin Forbes](/wiki/Edwin_Forbes\n\"Edwin Forbes\")\n\nBecause of its proximity to the large cities of the North, such as\n[Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\"),\n[Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania \"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\"),\nand [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), the Army of the\nPotomac received more contemporary media coverage than the other Union field\narmies. Such coverage produced fame for a number of this army's units.\nIndividual brigades, such as the [Irish Brigade](/wiki/Irish_Brigade_\\(U.S.\\)\n\"Irish Brigade \\(U.S.\\)\"), the [Philadelphia\nBrigade](/wiki/Philadelphia_Brigade \"Philadelphia Brigade\"), the [First New\nJersey Brigade](/wiki/First_New_Jersey_Brigade \"First New Jersey Brigade\"),\nthe [Vermont Brigade](/wiki/Vermont_Brigade \"Vermont Brigade\"), and the [Iron\nBrigade](/wiki/Iron_Brigade \"Iron Brigade\"), all became well known to the\ngeneral public, both during the Civil War and afterward.\n\n### Corps[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Army_of_the_Potomac&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Corps\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Scouts_and_guides_Army_of_the_Potomac.jpg/220px-\nScouts_and_guides_Army_of_the_Potomac.jpg)](/wiki/File:Scouts_and_guides_Army_of_the_Potomac.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Scouts_and_guides_Army_of_the_Potomac.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nScouts and guides, Army of the Potomac, [Mathew Brady](/wiki/Mathew_Brady\n\"Mathew Brady\")\n\nThe army originally consisted of fourteen divisions commanded by [Edwin\nSumner](/wiki/Edwin_Sumner \"Edwin Sumner\"), [William B.\nFranklin](/wiki/William_B._Franklin \"William B. Franklin\"), [Louis\nBlenker](/wiki/Louis_Blenker \"Louis Blenker\"), [Nathaniel\nBanks](/wiki/Nathaniel_Banks \"Nathaniel Banks\"), [Frederick W.\nLander](/wiki/Frederick_W._Lander \"Frederick W. Lander\"), [Silas\nCasey](/wiki/Silas_Casey \"Silas Casey\"), [Irvin McDowell](/wiki/Irvin_McDowell\n\"Irvin McDowell\"), [Fitz-John Porter](/wiki/Fitz-John_Porter \"Fitz-John\nPorter\"), [Samuel Heintzelman](/wiki/Samuel_Heintzelman \"Samuel Heintzelman\"),\n[Erasmus Keyes](/wiki/Erasmus_Keyes \"Erasmus Keyes\"), [William F.\nSmith](/wiki/William_Farrar_Smith \"William Farrar Smith\"), [Charles P.\nStone](/wiki/Charles_Pomeroy_Stone \"Charles Pomeroy Stone\") (replaced by John\nSedgwick in February 1862), and [George McCall](/wiki/George_McCall \"George\nMcCall\"). Because this arrangement would be too hard to control in battle,\nPresident Lincoln issued an order on March 13, 1862, dividing the army into\nsix corps headed by Sumner, Banks (despite being in the Shenandoah Valley and\nnot part of the main army), McDowell, Heintzelman, and Keyes, the highest-\nranking officers. McClellan was not happy with this, as he had intended to\nwait until the army had been tested in battle before judging which generals\nwere suitable for corps command.\n\nAfter the [Battle of Williamsburg](/wiki/Battle_of_Williamsburg \"Battle of\nWilliamsburg\") on May 5, McClellan requested and obtained permission to create\ntwo additions corps; these became the V Corps, headed by Brig. Gen Fitz-John\nPorter, and the VI Corps, headed by Brig. Gen William B. Franklin, both\npersonal favorites of his. After the Battle of Kernstown in the Valley on\nMarch 23, the administration became paranoid about [\"Stonewall\"\nJackson](/wiki/Stonewall_Jackson \"Stonewall Jackson\")'s activities there and\nthe potential danger they posed to Washington D.C., and to McClellan's\ndispleasure, detached Blenker's division from the II Corps and sent it to West\nVirginia to serve under [John C. Fremont](/wiki/John_C._Fremont \"John C.\nFremont\")'s command. McDowell's corps was detached as well and stationed in\nthe Rappahannock area.\n\nIn June 1862, George McCall's division from McDowell's corps (the\n[Pennsylvania Reserves](/wiki/Pennsylvania_Reserves \"Pennsylvania Reserves\")\nDivision) was sent down to the Peninsula and temporarily attached to the V\nCorps. In the Seven Days Battles, the V Corps was heavily engaged. The\nPennsylvania Reserves, in particular, suffered heavy losses including its\ndivision commander, who was captured by the Confederates, and two of its three\nbrigadiers ([John F. Reynolds](/wiki/John_F._Reynolds \"John F. Reynolds\"),\nalso captured, and [George Meade](/wiki/George_Meade \"George Meade\"), who was\nwounded). The III Corps fought at Glendale, however, the rest of the army was\nnot heavily engaged in the week-long fight aside from Slocum's division of the\nVI Corps, which was sent to reinforce the V Corps at Gaines Mill.\n\nThe Army of the Potomac remained on the Virginia Peninsula until August, when\nit was recalled back to Washington D.C. Keyes and one of the two IV Corps\ndivisions were left behind permanently as part of the newly-created Department\nof the James, while the other division, commanded by Brig. Gen Darius Couch\nwas attached to the VI Corps.\n\nDuring the Second Battle of Bull Run, the III and V Corps were temporarily\nattached to Pope's army; the former suffered major losses and was sent back to\nWashington to rest and refit afterward, so it did not participate in the\nMaryland Campaign. The V Corps attracted controversy during the battle when\nFitz-John Porter failed to execute Pope's orders properly and attack Stonewall\nJackson's flank despite his protests that James Longstreet's troops were\nblocking the way. Pope blamed the loss at Second Bull Run on Porter, who was\ncourt-martialed and spent much of his life attempting to get himself\nexonerated. Sigel's command, now redesignated the XI Corps, also spent the\nMaryland Campaign in Washington resting and refitting.\n\nIn the Maryland Campaign, the Army of the Potomac had six corps. These were\nthe I Corps, commanded by Joe Hooker after Irvin McDowell was removed from\ncommand, the II Corps, commanded by Edwin Sumner, the V Corps, headed by Fitz-\nJohn Porter, the VI Corps, headed by William Franklin, the IX Corps, headed by\nAmbrose Burnside and formerly the Department of North Carolina, and the XII\nCorps, headed by Nathaniel Banks until September 12, and given to Joseph K.\nMansfield just two days prior to Antietam, where he was killed in action.\n\nAt Antietam, the I and XII Corps were the first Union outfits to fight and\nboth corps suffered enormous casualties (plus the loss of their commanders) so\nthat they were down to near-division strength and their brigades at regimental\nstrength after the battle was over. The II and IX Corps were also heavily\nengaged but the V and VI Corps largely stayed out of the battle.\n\nWhen Burnside took over command of the army from McClellan in the fall, he\nformed the army into four Grand Divisions. The Right Grand Division was\ncommanded by Edwin Sumner and comprised the II and V Corps, the Center Grand\nDivision, commanded by Joe Hooker, comprised the IX and III Corps, and the\nLeft Grand Division, commanded by William Franklin, comprised the VI and I\nCorps. In addition, the Reserve Grand Division, commanded by Franz Sigel,\ncomprised the XI and XII Corps.\n\nAt Fredericksburg, the I Corps was commanded by John F. Reynolds, the II Corps\nby Darius Couch, the III Corps by George Stoneman, the V Corps by Daniel\nButterfield, the VI Corps by William F. Smith, and the IX Corps by Orlando\nWillcox. The XI Corps was commanded by Franz Sigel and the XII Corps by Henry\nSlocum, however, neither corps was present at Fredericksburg, the former not\narriving until after the battle was over, and the latter was stationed at\nHarper's Ferry.\n\nFollowing Fredericksburg, Burnside was removed from command of the army and\nreplaced by Joe Hooker. Hooker immediately abolished the Grand Divisions and\nalso for the first time organized the cavalry into a proper corps led by\nGeorge Stoneman instead of having them ineffectually scattered among infantry\ndivisions. Burnside and his old IX Corps departed out to a command in the\nWestern Theater. The I, II, and XII Corps retained the same commanders they\nhad had during the Fredericksburg campaign, but the other corps got new\ncommanders once again. Daniel Butterfield was chosen by Hooker as his new\nchief of staff and command of the V Corps went to George Meade. Daniel Sickles\nreceived command of the III Corps and Oliver Howard the XI Corps after Franz\nSigel had resigned, refusing to serve under Hooker, his junior in rank.\nWilliam Franklin also left the army for the same reason. Edwin Sumner, who was\nin his 60s and exhausted from campaigning, departed as well and died a few\nmonths later. William F. Smith resigned from command of the VI Corps, which\nwas taken over by John Sedgwick. The I and V Corps were not significantly\nengaged during the Chancellorsville campaign.\n\nDuring the Gettysburg Campaign, the army's existing organization was largely\nretained, but a number of brigades composed of short-term nine-month regiments\ndeparted as their enlistment terms expired. Darius Couch resigned from command\nof the II Corps after Chancellorsville, the corps going to Winfield Hancock.\nThe Pennsylvania Reserves Division, having spent several months in Washington\nD.C. resting and refitting from the 1862 campaigns, returned to the army, but\nwas added to the V Corps rather than rejoining the I Corps. George Stoneman\nhad been removed from command of the cavalry corps by Hooker after a poor\nperformance during the Chancellorsville campaign and replaced by Alfred\nPleasanton.\n\nGeorge Meade was suddenly appointed the commander of the army on June 28, a\nmere three days before the battle of Gettysburg. At the battle, the I, II, and\nIII Corps suffered such severe losses that they were almost nonfunctional as\nfighting units at the end. One corps commander (Reynolds) was killed, another\n(Sickles) lost a leg and was permanently out of the war, and a third (Hancock)\nwas badly wounded and never completely recovered from his injuries. The VI\nCorps had not been significantly engaged and was mostly used to plug up holes\nin the line during the battle.\n\nFor the remainder of the war, corps were added and subtracted from the army.\nIV Corps was broken up after the Peninsula Campaign, with its headquarters and\n2nd Division left behind in Yorktown, while its 1st Division moved north,\nattached to the VI Corps, in the Maryland Campaign. Those parts of the IV\nCorps that remained on the Peninsula were reassigned to the Department of\nVirginia and disbanded on October 1, 1863.[2] Those added to the Army of the\nPotomac were [IX Corps](/wiki/IX_Corps_\\(Union_Army\\) \"IX Corps \\(Union\nArmy\\)\"), [XI Corps](/wiki/XI_Corps_\\(Union_Army\\) \"XI Corps \\(Union Army\\)\")\n([Sigel's](/wiki/Franz_Sigel \"Franz Sigel\") I Corps in the former [Army of\nVirginia](/wiki/Army_of_Virginia \"Army of Virginia\")), [XII\nCorps](/wiki/XII_Corps_\\(Union_Army\\) \"XII Corps \\(Union Army\\)\")\n([Banks's](/wiki/Nathaniel_P._Banks \"Nathaniel P. Banks\") II Corps from the\n[Army of Virginia](/wiki/Army_of_Virginia \"Army of Virginia\") ), added in\n1862; and the [Cavalry\nCorps](/wiki/Cavalry_Corps_\\(Union_Army\\)#Cavalry_Corps,_Army_of_the_Potomac\n\"Cavalry Corps \\(Union Army\\)\"), created in 1863. Eight of these corps (seven\ninfantry, one cavalry) served in the army during 1863, but due to attrition\nand transfers, the army was reorganized in March 1864 with only four corps:\nII, V, VI, and Cavalry. Of the original eight, I and III Corps were disbanded\ndue to heavy casualties and their units combined into other corps. The XI and\nXII Corps were ordered to the West in late 1863 to support the [Chattanooga\nCampaign](/wiki/Chattanooga_Campaign \"Chattanooga Campaign\"), and while there\nwere combined into the XX Corps, never returning to the East.\n\nThe IX Corps returned to the army in 1864, after being assigned to the\n[West](/wiki/Western_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Western Theater of the\nAmerican Civil War\") in 1863 and then served alongside, but not as part of,\nthe Army of the Potomac from March to May 24, 1864. On that latter date, IX\nCorps was formally added to the Army of the Potomac.[3] Two divisions of the\nCavalry Corps have transferred in August 1864 to Maj. Gen. [Philip\nSheridan](/wiki/Philip_Sheridan \"Philip Sheridan\")'s [Army of the\nShenandoah](/wiki/Union_Army_of_the_Shenandoah \"Union Army of the\nShenandoah\"), and the 2nd Division alone remained under Meade's command.
