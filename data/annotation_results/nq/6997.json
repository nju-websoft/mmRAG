Introduced\nin 1954 for [West Berlin](/wiki/West_Berlin \"West Berlin\"), it shows a black\n[bear](/wiki/Bear_in_heraldry \"Bear in heraldry\") on a white shield. On top of\nthe shield is a special crown, created by the amalgamation of the [mural\ncrown](/wiki/Mural_crown \"Mural crown\") of a city with the so-called [people's\ncrown](/wiki/People%27s_crown \"People's crown\") (_Volkskrone_), used in\nGermany to denote a republic. Berlin's various boroughs use their own emblems.\n\nThe bear has been used as a charge in the Berlin coat of arms since 1709,\nformerly alongside the [eagles](/wiki/Eagle_\\(heraldry\\) \"Eagle \\(heraldry\\)\")\nof [Brandenburg](/wiki/Brandenburg \"Brandenburg\") and [Prussia](/wiki/Prussia\n\"Prussia\").[1] A bear occurs on seals, coins and signet rings from as early as\nthe late 12th century (but not as heraldic charge before 1709), presumably due\nto a [canting](/wiki/Canting_arms \"Canting arms\") association with the city's\nname.[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 State logo\n  * 3 Legal status\n  * 4 Symbol of Berlin\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe oldest preserved and known seal of Berlin is from 1253. It depicts the\n[Brandenburg Eagle](/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Brandenburg \"Coat of arms of\nBrandenburg\") spreading its wings in a [clover](/wiki/Clover \"Clover\")-shaped\n[archway](/wiki/Arch \"Arch\"). The text on the seal is `SIGILLVM DE BERLIN\nBVRGENSIVM` (seal of Berlin's citizens). It supposedly was the seal of\nBerlin's first [mayor](/wiki/Mayor \"Mayor\") Marsilius.\n\nA later seal dated to 1280 shows bears as [supporters](/wiki/Supporters\n\"Supporters\") of the Brandenburg coat of arms. The bear appears to have risen\nin popularity during the 17th century, with an early depiction on a coat of\narms in a signet ring dated 1603, and it was adopted as a heraldic charge in\n1709. The shield was now divided in three parts, showing the bear below the\neagles of Brandenburg and Prussia. Heraldist Adolf Matthias Hildebrandt in\n1883 designed a number of proposals for a new coat of arms. One of these was\nthe simplified _azure a bear rampant sable_ with a [mural\ncrown](/wiki/Mural_crown \"Mural crown\") in the crest. This was in use as minor\ncoat of arms from 1920, and was adopted as the only coat of arms of [West\nBerlin](/wiki/West_Berlin \"West Berlin\") in 1954, while [East\nBerlin](/wiki/East_Berlin \"East Berlin\") continued to use the design of 1935.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Klippe_Medal_Town_Seal_Berlin_1253%2C_obverse.jpg/118px-Klippe_Medal_Town_Seal_Berlin_1253%2C_obverse.jpg)](/wiki/File:Klippe_Medal_Town_Seal_Berlin_1253,_obverse.jpg)\n\nThe oldest known Berlin [town seal](/wiki/Seal_\\(emblem\\) \"Seal \\(emblem\\)\")\nof 1253 copied to the obverse of a [Klippe medal](/wiki/Klippe_\\(coin\\)\n\"Klippe \\(coin\\)\") by [Deutscher Kulturbund, the cultural association of the\nGDR](/wiki/Cultural_Association_of_the_GDR \"Cultural Association of the GDR\").\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Seal_Berlin_1280.png/116px-Seal_Berlin_1280.png)](/wiki/File:Seal_Berlin_1280.png)\n\nGuild Seal of Berlin, 1280\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Seal_Berlin_1338.png/120px-Seal_Berlin_1338.png)](/wiki/File:Seal_Berlin_1338.png)\n\nSeal of 1338\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Signet_ring_of_Berlin_1603.png/119px-Signet_ring_of_Berlin_1603.png)](/wiki/File:Signet_ring_of_Berlin_1603.png)\n\nSignet ring of Berlin, 1603\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Coat_of_arms_Berlin_1709.png/114px-Coat_of_arms_Berlin_1709.png)](/wiki/File:Coat_of_arms_Berlin_1709.png)\n\nThe arms of Berlin, 1709\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Coat_of_arms_Berlin_small_1883.png/86px-Coat_of_arms_Berlin_small_1883.png)](/wiki/File:Coat_of_arms_Berlin_small_1883.png)\n\nLesser coat of arms (1883)\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Wappen_Preu%C3%9Fische_Provinzen_-_Stadt_Berlin.jpg/87px-Wappen_Preu%C3%9Fische_Provinzen_-_Stadt_Berlin.jpg)](/wiki/File:Wappen_Preu%C3%9Fische_Provinzen_-_Stadt_Berlin.jpg)\n\nCoat of arms of the city of Berlin as rendered by Hugo Gerhard Ströhl,\n_Deutsche Wappenrolle_ , 1897\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Wappen_Gro%C3%9F-Berlin.png/107px-Wappen_Gro%C3%9F-Berlin.png)](/wiki/File:Wappen_Gro%C3%9F-Berlin.png)\n\nCoat of arms of [Greater Berlin](/wiki/Greater_Berlin_Act \"Greater Berlin\nAct\") 1920–1934\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Seal_of_Berlin_1920.png/120px-Seal_of_Berlin_1920.png)](/wiki/File:Seal_of_Berlin_1920.png)\n\nSeal of Berlin as the capital of the [Weimar Republic](/wiki/Weimar_Republic\n\"Weimar Republic\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin_%281935%29.svg/62px-Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin_%281935%29.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin_\\(1935\\).svg)\n\nCoat of arms 1935–1954 and of [East Berlin](/wiki/East_Berlin \"East Berlin\"),\n1954-1990.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin.svg/73px-Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin.svg)\n\nCoat of arms of [West Berlin](/wiki/West_Berlin \"West Berlin\"), 1954-1990.\n\n## State\nlogo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: State logo\")]\n\nTo enable civilians and non-governmental institutions to express their\naffinity with Berlin, the Senate of the Interior and Sports provided a logo\nwhich features the arms' shield without the crown in black and white or\ncoloured versions.\n\n## Legal\nstatus[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Legal status\")]\n\nThe coat of arms was laid down in a law of 1954:\n\n> § 1 (1) The coat of arms shows on a silver (white) shield, a black bear\n> rampant with tongue and claws in red.

A member of the Historical Society went on\nto collect a total of 273 different representations of bears in Berlin.\nHildebrandt in 1915 again complained about the excesses of variation in the\nbear, especially deviation from the Prussian tincture of black on white.[4]\n\nThe bear has remained the city's mascot,[5] and in 2001 has been developed\ninto the so-called _[Berlin Buddy Bears](/wiki/United_Buddy_Bears \"United\nBuddy Bears\")_ , fiberglass sculptures of bears first introduced in 2001, have\nbeen used to promote the qualities of \"tolerance\" and _Weltoffenheit_\n(cosmopolitanism) associated with the city.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Berlin%2C_Germany_%288000955399%29.jpg/270px-Berlin%2C_Germany_%288000955399%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Berlin,_Germany_\\(8000955399\\).jpg)\n\nGiant Romeo Britto Friendship Bear\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Buddybear_Athen.jpg/120px-Buddybear_Athen.jpg)](/wiki/File:Buddybear_Athen.jpg)\n\n[The Berlin Buddy Bear](/wiki/United_Buddy_Bears \"United Buddy Bears\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Two_Berlin-themed_T-shirts%2C_one_showing_occupation_map%2C_1984.jpg/240px-Two_Berlin-themed_T-shirts%2C_one_showing_occupation_map%2C_1984.jpg)](/wiki/File:Two_Berlin-themed_T-shirts,_one_showing_occupation_map,_1984.jpg)\n\nBear themed [T-shirts](/wiki/T-shirt \"T-shirt\"), from 1984.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Bearlin_Graffiti.jpg/270px-Bearlin_Graffiti.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bearlin_Graffiti.jpg)\n\nGraffiti in Berlin\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Azure%2C_a_bend_Or.svg/25px-Azure%2C_a_bend_Or.svg.png)[Heraldry portal](/wiki/Portal:Heraldry \"Portal:Heraldry\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin.svg/17px-Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin.svg.png)[Berlin portal](/wiki/Portal:Berlin \"Portal:Berlin\")\n\n  * [Flag of Berlin](/wiki/Flag_of_Berlin \"Flag of Berlin\")\n  * [Berolina](/wiki/Berolina \"Berolina\"), personification of Berlin\n  * [Origin of the coats of arms of German federal states](/wiki/Origin_of_the_coats_of_arms_of_German_federal_states \"Origin of the coats of arms of German federal states\")\n  * [Coat of arms of Bern](/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Bern \"Coat of arms of Bern\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_Berlin&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Senatsverwaltung für Inneres und Sport.
