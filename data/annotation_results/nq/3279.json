Members of the\n[Western Writers of America](/wiki/Western_Writers_of_America \"Western Writers\nof America\") chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.[2]\n\nIt tells the story of an [Arizona Ranger](/wiki/Arizona_Rangers \"Arizona\nRangers\")'s duel with an outlaw named Texas Red in the \"town of Agua Fria\".[3]\nThe townspeople predict the death of the Ranger, Texas Red having already\nkilled \"one and nineteen men\", but the Ranger kills Texas Red with the\nswiftness of the \"big iron on his hip.\" This term refers to the gun the Ranger\ncarries. Texas Red hadn't even \"cleared leather\" \\- the Ranger's draw was that\nswift.\n\nRobbins's version of the song reached #5 on the Billboard Country chart and\n#26 on the [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")\nchart in April 1960.[4]\n\nThe song is also featured in the video game _[Fallout: New\nVegas](/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas \"Fallout: New Vegas\")_ on the in-game radio,\nRadio New Vegas.\n\nThe Ranger's \"Big Iron\" actually existed. It was a one-off custom handgun\nchambered in [.45 Colt](/wiki/.45_Colt \".45 Colt\") and featured a [Great\nWestern](/wiki/Great_Western_Arms_Company \"Great Western Arms Company\") copy\nof the [Colt Single Action Army](/wiki/Colt_Single_Action_Army \"Colt Single\nAction Army\") frame, [Colt 1860 Army](/wiki/Colt_Army_Model_1860 \"Colt Army\nModel 1860\") backstrap, grip frame and grips and a cut down 9 1/2\"\n[Marlin](/wiki/Marlin_Firearms \"Marlin Firearms\") rifle barrel. Marty Robbins\nsaw it in Andy Anderson's famed North Hollywood gun shop in the late 1950s and\nwrote the song around it. Its current whereabouts are unknown.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 In albums\n  * 2 Cover versions\n  * 3 Charts\n  * 4 References\n\n## In albums[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Iron&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: In albums\")]\n\n  * _Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs_ (September 1959), a compilation, CL 1349 - mono, CS 8158 - stereo, PC 8158\n  * _More Greatest Hits_ (April 1961), CL 1635 - mono, CS 8435 - stereo, PC 8435\n  * _Bend in the River_ (1968), D 445 - mono (Columbia Musical Treasuries), DS 445 - stereo\n  * _The Heart of Marty Robbins_ (1969), STS 2016 (Columbia Star Series)\n  * _All Time Greatest Hits_ (August 1972), CG 31361, KG 31361, C 31361\n  * _Marty!_ (1972 - 5 record set), P5S 5812 (Columbia Musical Treasury)\n  * _Streets of Laredo_ , KH 32286 (Harmony, August 1973), LE 10576 (Columbia, December 1973)\n  * _Marty Robbins ' Own Favorites_ (1974), P 12416 (Columbia Special Products)\n  * _Marty Robbins Gold_ (1975), NU 9060 (K-Tel)\n  * _All Around Cowboy_ (1980) P 15594\n  * _No. 1 Cowboy_ (1980), P 15594 (re-release of \"All Around Cowboy\")\n  * _Marty Robbins_ (1981), GS 4003 (History of Country Music, Sunrise Media)\n  * _A Lifetime of Song 1951 - 1982_ (August 1983), C2 38870\n  * _Memories in Song_ (1983 - 2 record set), P2 19162 (Columbia Special Product)\n  * _The Best Of Marty Robbins_ (1984), RB4-214-1\n  * _The Essential MARTY ROBBINS:1951-1982_ (1991), Sony Music Entertainment Inc C2T 48537 CT48538 CT 48539\n  * _MARTY ROBBINS Lost and found_ (1994), Sony Music Entertainment Inc CT 57695\n  * _MARTY ROBBINS Memories in Song_ (1994), Sony Music Special Products Compact Disc A 19163\n  * _MARTY ROBBINS LIVE Concert Versions Of His Greatest Hits_ (1995),Pickwick Group Ltd London England 300382\n  * _Under Western Skies_ (Oct 1995), Bear Family Records, West Germany 4-CD Box Set BCD 15646\n  * _MARTY ROBBINS Legendary Country Singers_ (1995), Sony Music Special Products R989-06 PT-25142\n  * _Story of My Life: Best of MARTY ROBBINS_ (Mar 1996), Sony Music Entertainment Inc Sony CK 64763\n\n## Cover versions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Iron&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cover versions\")]\n\n[Michael Martin Murphey](/wiki/Michael_Martin_Murphey \"Michael Martin\nMurphey\") covered the song on his 1993 album _[Cowboy Songs\nIII](/wiki/Cowboy_Songs_III \"Cowboy Songs III\")_.
