The theory was popularized in the 1840s by\nScottish writer [Thomas Carlyle](/wiki/Thomas_Carlyle \"Thomas Carlyle\"), but\nin 1860 [Herbert Spencer](/wiki/Herbert_Spencer \"Herbert Spencer\") formulated\na counter-argument that has remained influential throughout the 20th century\nto the present: Spencer said that such great men are the products of their\nsocieties, and that their actions would be impossible without the social\nconditions built before their lifetimes.[1][2][3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Overview\n  * 2 Criticism\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Overview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Great_man_theory&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Overview\")]\n\nCarlyle stated that \"The history of the world is but the biography of great\nmen\", reflecting his belief that heroes shape history through both their\npersonal attributes and divine inspiration.[4][5] In his book [_On Heroes,\nHero-Worship and the Heroic in\nHistory_](/wiki/On_Heroes,_Hero_Worship_and_the_Heroic_in_History \"On Heroes,\nHero Worship and the Heroic in History\"), Carlyle saw history as having turned\non the decisions of \"heroes\", giving detailed analysis of the influence of\nseveral such men (including [Muhammad](/wiki/Muhammad \"Muhammad\"),\n[Shakespeare](/wiki/Shakespeare \"Shakespeare\"), [Luther](/wiki/Martin_Luther\n\"Martin Luther\"), [Rousseau](/wiki/Rousseau \"Rousseau\"),\n[Pericles](/wiki/Pericles \"Pericles\"), [Napoleon](/wiki/Napoleon \"Napoleon\"),\nand [Wagner](/wiki/Richard_Wagner \"Richard Wagner\")). Carlyle also felt that\nthe study of great men was \"profitable\" to one's own heroic side; that by\nexamining the lives led by such heroes, one could not help but uncover\nsomething about one's true nature.[6]\n\nAmerican scholar [Frederick Adams\nWoods](/w/index.php?title=Frederick_Adams_Woods&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Frederick Adams Woods \\(page does not exist\\)\") supported the great man\ntheory in his work _The Influence of Monarchs: Steps in a New Science of\nHistory_.[7] Woods investigated 386 rulers in Western Europe from the 12th\ncentury until the French revolution in the late 18th century and their\ninfluence on the course of historical events.\n\nThis theory is usually contrasted with \"[history from\nbelow](/wiki/History_from_below \"History from below\")\", which emphasises the\nlife of the legion over the leader. An overwhelming wave of smaller events\ncauses certain developments to occur. The Great Man approach to history was\nmost fashionable with professional historians in the 19th century; a popular\nwork of this school is the _[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh\nEdition](/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition \"Encyclopædia\nBritannica Eleventh Edition\")_ (1911) which contains lengthy and detailed\nbiographies about the great men of history, but very few general or social\nhistories. For example, all information on the post-Roman \"[Migrations\nPeriod](/wiki/Migrations_Period \"Migrations Period\")\" of European History is\ncompiled under the biography of [Attila the Hun](/wiki/Attila_the_Hun \"Attila\nthe Hun\"). This heroic view of history was also strongly endorsed by some\nphilosophers, such as [Leon Bloy](/wiki/Leon_Bloy \"Leon Bloy\"),\n[Hegel](/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel \"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\"),\n[Kierkegaard](/wiki/Kierkegaard \"Kierkegaard\"), [Nietzsche](/wiki/Nietzsche\n\"Nietzsche\"), [Spengler](/wiki/Oswald_Spengler \"Oswald Spengler\") and [Max\nWeber](/wiki/Max_Weber \"Max Weber\"),[8][9][10] but it fell out of favor after\n[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn _[Untimely Meditations](/wiki/Untimely_Meditations \"Untimely Meditations\")_\n, Nietzsche writes that: \"... the goal of humanity lies in its highest\nspecimens\".[11]\n\nIn _[Fear and Trembling](/wiki/Fear_and_Trembling \"Fear and Trembling\")_ ,\nKierkegaard writes that: \"...to be able to fall down in such a way that the\nsame second it looks as if one were standing and walking, to transform the\nleap of life into a walk, absolutely to express the sublime and the\npedestrian—that only these knights of faith can do—this is the one and only\nprodigy.\"[12]\n\nHegel, proceeding from providentialist theory, argued that \"what is real is\nreasonable\" and World-Historical individuals are World-Spirit's agents. Hegel\nwrote: \"Such are great historical men—whose own particular aims involve those\nlarge issues which are the will of the World-Spirit.\"[13] Thus, according to\nHegel, a great man does not create historical reality himself but only\nuncovers the inevitable future.\n\n## Criticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Great_man_theory&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Criticism\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Herbert_Spencer.jpg/170px-\nHerbert_Spencer.jpg)](/wiki/File:Herbert_Spencer.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Herbert_Spencer.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Herbert Spencer](/wiki/Herbert_Spencer \"Herbert Spencer\") was a contemporary\ncritic of Carlyle's great man theory.\n\nOne of the most forceful critics of Carlyle's formulation of the great man\ntheory was [Herbert Spencer](/wiki/Herbert_Spencer \"Herbert Spencer\"), who\nbelieved that attributing historical events to the decisions of individuals\nwas a hopelessly primitive, childish, and unscientific position.[14] He\nbelieved that the men Carlyle called \"great men\" were merely products of their\nsocial environment:\n\n> You must admit that the genesis of a great man depends on the long series of\n> complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the\n> social state into which that race has slowly grown.... Before he can remake\n> his society, his society must make him.\n>\n> — Herbert Spencer, _The Study of Sociology_[15]\n\n[Tolstoy](/wiki/Tolstoy \"Tolstoy\")'s _[War and Peace](/wiki/War_and_Peace \"War\nand Peace\")_ features criticism of Great Man Theories as a recurring theme in\nthe philosophical digressions. According to Tolstoy, the significance of great\nindividuals is imaginary; as a matter of fact they are only _history 's\nslaves_ realizing the decree of Providence.[16]\n\n[William James](/wiki/William_James \"William James\") in his lecture \"Great Men\nand Their Environment\"[17] underlined the importance of the Great Man's\ncongruence with the surroundings (in the broad sense), though his ultimate\npoint was that environments and individuals shape each other reciprocally,\njust as environments and individual members of animal species do according to\n[Darwinian](/wiki/Darwinism \"Darwinism\") theory.\n\nAmong modern critics of the theory of great man, one, [Sidney\nHook](/wiki/Sidney_Hook \"Sidney Hook\"), is supportive of the idea; he gives\ncredit to those who shape events through their actions, and his book _The Hero\nin History_ is devoted to the role of the [hero](/wiki/Hero \"Hero\") and in\nhistory and influence of the outstanding [persons](/wiki/Person \"Person\").[18]\n\n[Leonid Grinin](/wiki/Leonid_Grinin \"Leonid Grinin\") defines a historical\nfigure (a great man) thus:\n\n> Owing to his personal features, or to a chance, or to his social standing,\n> or to the peculiarity of the epoch, an individual by the very fact of his\n> existence, by his ideas or actions (or inaction) directly or indirectly,\n> during his lifetime or after his death may have such an influence upon his\n> own or another society which can be recognized significant as he left a\n> noticeable mark (positive, negative or unambiguous) in history and in the\n> further development of society.[19]\n\nSo, he concludes that the role of great man depends on a number of factors,\nnot none at all.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Great_man_theory&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/P_history.svg/31px-P_history.svg.png)[History portal](/wiki/Portal:History \"Portal:History\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png)[Philosophy portal](/wiki/Portal:Philosophy \"Portal:Philosophy\")\n\n  * [Annales School](/wiki/Annales_School \"Annales School\") and [New History](/wiki/Nouvelle_histoire \"Nouvelle histoire\")\n  * [Greatness](/wiki/Greatness \"Greatness\")\n  * [Max Weber](/wiki/Max_Weber \"Max Weber\")'s [charismatic authority](/wiki/Charismatic_authority \"Charismatic authority\")\n  * [Heroic theory of invention and scientific development](/wiki/Heroic_theory_of_invention_and_scientific_development \"Heroic theory of invention and scientific development\")\n  * _[The Hero with a Thousand Faces](/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\")_\n  * [Knight of faith](/wiki/Knight_of_faith \"Knight of faith\")\n  * [List of people considered father or mother of a field](/wiki/List_of_people_considered_father_or_mother_of_a_field \"List of people considered father or mother of a field\")\n  * [People's history](/wiki/People%27s_history \"People's history\")\n  * [Prosopography](/wiki/Prosopography \"Prosopography\")\n  * [Übermensch](/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch \"Übermensch\")\n  * [Whig history](/wiki/Whig_history \"Whig history\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Great_man_theory&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Robert L.
