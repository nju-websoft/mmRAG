Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the\nways of the wolves, but the boy faces certain challenges and falls behind his\nwolf siblings while Akela disapproves of him using human tricks like building\ntools instead of learning the ways of the pack.\n\nOne day, during the [dry season](/wiki/Dry_season \"Dry season\"), the\n[jungle](/wiki/Jungle \"Jungle\") animals gather to drink the water that remains\nas part of a truce during a [drought](/wiki/Drought \"Drought\") that enables\nthe jungle's wildlife to drink without fear of being eaten by their predators.\nThe truce is disrupted when a scarred [tiger](/wiki/Tiger \"Tiger\") named\n[Shere Khan](/wiki/Shere_Khan \"Shere Khan\") arrives detecting Mowgli's scent\nin the large crowd. Resentful against man for scarring him, he issues a\nwarning that he will kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the drought\nends, the wolves debate whether they should keep Mowgli or not. Mowgli decides\nto leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera agrees with the\ndecision and volunteers to guide him to the nearby man village.\n\nEn route, Shere Khan ambushes them and injures Bagheera, but Mowgli manages to\nescape. Later, Mowgli meets an enormous python named [Kaa](/wiki/Kaa \"Kaa\")\nwho hypnotizes him. While under her influence, Mowgli sees a vision of his\nfather being mauled while protecting him from Shere Khan. The vision also\nwarns of the destructive power of the \"red flower\" (fire). Kaa attempts to\ndevour Mowgli, but she is attacked by a large brown [sloth\nbear](/wiki/Sloth_bear \"Sloth bear\") named [Baloo](/wiki/Baloo \"Baloo\"),\nrescuing an unconscious Mowgli. Baloo and Mowgli bond while retrieving some\ndifficult-to-access honey for Baloo and Mowgli agrees to stay with Baloo until\nthe winter season arrives. Upon learning that Mowgli has left the jungle,\nShere Khan kills Akela and threatens the pack to lure Mowgli out.\n\nBagheera eventually finds Mowgli and Baloo and is angered that Mowgli has not\njoined the humans as agreed, but Baloo calms him down and persuades both of\nthem to sleep on it. During the night, Mowgli finds a herd of [Indian\nelephants](/wiki/Indian_elephant \"Indian elephant\") gathered around a ditch\nand uses his vines to save a baby elephant from the ditch. Although Baloo and\nBagheera are both impressed, Baloo realizes that he cannot guarantee Mowgli's\nsafety after learning that he is being hunted by Shere Khan. Baloo agrees to\npush Mowgli away to get him to continue onward to the man village.\n\nMowgli is kidnapped by the \"[Bandar-log](/wiki/Bandar-log \"Bandar-log\")\"\n(monkeys) who present him to their leader, a [giant ape](/wiki/Gigantopithecus\n\"Gigantopithecus\") named [King Louie](/wiki/King_Louie \"King Louie\"). Assuming\nthat all humans can make fire, King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere\nKhan in exchange for it. Baloo distracts King Louie while Bagheera tries to\nsneak him out, but their plan is discovered. As King Louie chases Mowgli\nthrough his temple, he informs Mowgli of Akela's death. King Louie's rampage\neventually causes his temple to collapse on top of him. Furious that Baloo and\nBagheera never told him about Akela's death, Mowgli goes to confront Shere\nKhan alone.\n\nMowgli steals a lit torch at the village to use as a weapon and heads back to\nthe jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. He confronts\nShere Khan, who argues that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by\ncausing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere\nKhan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold\nShere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan\nup a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight and\nShere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants\nto divert the river and put out the fire.\n\nIn the aftermath, Raksha becomes the new leader of the wolf pack. Mowgli\ndecides to utilize his equipment and tricks for his own use, having found his\ntrue home and calling with his wolf family, Baloo, and Bagheera.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Jungle_Book_\\(2016_film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\nMain article: [List of The Jungle Book\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_The_Jungle_Book_characters \"List of The Jungle Book\ncharacters\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Neel_Sethi_Press_conference_of_%27The_Jungle_Book%27.jpg/170px-\nNeel_Sethi_Press_conference_of_%27The_Jungle_Book%27.jpg)](/wiki/File:Neel_Sethi_Press_conference_of_%27The_Jungle_Book%27.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Neel_Sethi_Press_conference_of_%27The_Jungle_Book%27.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nNeel Sethi, the actor who portrayed Mowgli\n\n  * Neel Sethi as [Mowgli](/wiki/Mowgli \"Mowgli\"), a young boy who was raised by wolves. \n    * Kendrick Reyes as toddler Mowgli\n  * [Ritesh Rajan](/wiki/Ritesh_Rajan \"Ritesh Rajan\") as Mowgli's father\n\n### Voice\ncast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Jungle_Book_\\(2016_film\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Voice cast\")]\n\n  * [Bill Murray](/wiki/Bill_Murray \"Bill Murray\") as [Baloo](/wiki/Baloo \"Baloo\"), a [Sloth bear](/wiki/Sloth_bear \"Sloth bear\") who befriends Mowgli.\n  * [Ben Kingsley](/wiki/Ben_Kingsley \"Ben Kingsley\") as [Bagheera](/wiki/Bagheera \"Bagheera\"), a [Black panther](/wiki/Black_panther \"Black panther\") who is Mowgli's mentor and protector.\n  * [Idris Elba](/wiki/Idris_Elba \"Idris Elba\") as [Shere Khan](/wiki/Shere_Khan \"Shere Khan\"), a fearsome, scar-faced tiger with a grudge against Mowgli.\n  * [Lupita Nyong'o](/wiki/Lupita_Nyong%27o \"Lupita Nyong'o\") as [Raksha](/wiki/Raksha_\\(The_Jungle_Book\\) \"Raksha \\(The Jungle Book\\)\"), a female wolf who is Mowgli's adoptive mother.\n  * [Scarlett Johansson](/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson \"Scarlett Johansson\") as [Kaa](/wiki/Kaa \"Kaa\"), an enormous python.\n  * [Giancarlo Esposito](/wiki/Giancarlo_Esposito \"Giancarlo Esposito\") as [Akela](/wiki/Akela_\\(The_Jungle_Book\\) \"Akela \\(The Jungle Book\\)\"), a male wolf who leads the pack.\n  * [Christopher Walken](/wiki/Christopher_Walken \"Christopher Walken\") as [King Louie](/wiki/King_Louie \"King Louie\"), a giant ape who rules the [Bandar-log](/wiki/Bandar-log \"Bandar-log\").\n  * [Garry Shandling](/wiki/Garry_Shandling \"Garry Shandling\") as [Ikki](/wiki/List_of_The_Jungle_Book_characters#In_the_Mowgli_stories \"List of The Jungle Book characters\"), a porcupine that observes the Water Truce.[1]\n  * Brighton Rose as [Grey Brother](/wiki/Grey_Brother \"Grey Brother\"), a wolf cub that is Mowgli's adoptive brother.[1]\n  * [Jon Favreau](/wiki/Jon_Favreau \"Jon Favreau\") as Fred, a [Pygmy Hog](/wiki/Pygmy_hog \"Pygmy hog\").[1]\n  * [Sam Raimi](/wiki/Sam_Raimi \"Sam Raimi\") as a giant squirrel.[1]\n  * [Russell Peters](/wiki/Russell_Peters \"Russell Peters\") as Rocky, a rhinoceros.[1]\n  * Madeleine Favreau as Raquel, a rhinoceros.[1]\n  * Sara Arrington as an antelope [1]\n\n[Emjay Anthony](/wiki/Emjay_Anthony \"Emjay Anthony\"), Max Favreau, Chloe\nHechter, Asher Blinkoff, Knox Gagnon, Sasha Schrieber, and Kai Schrieber voice\nthe Young Wolves.[1]\n\n[Dee Bradley Baker](/wiki/Dee_Bradley_Baker \"Dee Bradley Baker\"), Artie\nEsposito, Sean Johnson, and [Allan Trautman](/wiki/Allan_Trautman \"Allan\nTrautman\") provide additional animal voices.[1]\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Jungle_Book_\\(2016_film\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n### Development and\ncasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Jungle_Book_\\(2016_film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Development and casting\")]\n\n\"The idea of going out to the jungle and shooting this, it just felt like it\nwouldn't have the magic that the 1967 film had had. There was a dreamlike\nquality to it. There was a surreal quality to it. It was a high-water mark for\ncharacter animation and to me, that's what I remember about it. And so I\nwanted to make sure we preserved that...But what [[Alan]\nHorn](/wiki/Alan_F._Horn \"Alan F. Horn\") said was: Look at the technology.\nLook at _[Life of Pi](/wiki/Life_of_Pi_\\(film\\) \"Life of Pi \\(film\\)\")_ ,\n_[Avatar](/wiki/Avatar_\\(2009_film\\) \"Avatar \\(2009 film\\)\")_. Why not use the\ntechnology to create a whole world that transports you? Let's really embrace\nthis new technology and see what we can do if we push its limit.\"\n\n— Jon Favreau on approaching the film's technical intent.[9]\n\n[Walt Disney Pictures](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures \"Walt Disney Pictures\")\nannounced that a [live-action remake](/wiki/Disney_Live_Action_Remakes \"Disney\nLive Action Remakes\") of _[The Jungle\nBook](/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_\\(1967_film\\) \"The Jungle Book \\(1967 film\\)\")_\nwas in development on July 9, 2013, with Justin Marks set to write the\nscript.[10] The film would be Disney's second live-action adaptation of\n[Rudyard Kipling](/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling \"Rudyard Kipling\")'s works, following\n[the 1994 film](/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_\\(1994_film\\) \"The Jungle Book \\(1994\nfilm\\)\"), and the studio's third overall after the [1967 animated\nmusical](/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_\\(1967_film\\) \"The Jungle Book \\(1967 film\\)\").\n[Jon Favreau](/wiki/Jon_Favreau \"Jon Favreau\") was later confirmed as director\non November 5, 2013.[11] Favreau as a child used to watch Disney's 1967\nanimated musical version.[12] He felt the need to strike a balance between the\ntwo films by retaining the buoyant spirit of the 1967 film, including some of\nits memorable songs, while crafting a movie with more realism and peril. He\nalso stressed the importance of nature and realized how things have shifted\nduring Kipling's time and now, \"In Kipling's time, nature was something to be\novercome. Now nature is something to be protected.\"[12] He was encouraged by\n[Walt Disney Studios](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_\\(division\\) \"Walt Disney\nStudios \\(division\\)\") chairman [Alan Horn](/wiki/Alan_F._Horn \"Alan F. Horn\")\nto take advantage of the film's setting and story as an opportunity to use the\nlatest advancements in [photorealistic](/wiki/Photorealism \"Photorealism\")\n[rendering](/wiki/Rendering_\\(computer_graphics\\) \"Rendering \\(computer\ngraphics\\)\"), [computer-generated imagery](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery\n\"Computer-generated imagery\"), and [motion capture](/wiki/Motion_capture\n\"Motion capture\") technologies.[13] The story of the film is not independently\ntaken from Kipling's works, but also borrows cinematic inspirations from other\nfilms, including the child-mentor relationship in\n_[Shane](/wiki/Shane_\\(film\\) \"Shane \\(film\\)\")_ (1953), the establishment of\nrules in a dangerous world from _[Goodfellas](/wiki/Goodfellas \"Goodfellas\")_\n(1990) and the use of a shadowy jungle figure in _[Apocalypse\nNow](/wiki/Apocalypse_Now \"Apocalypse Now\")_ (1979).[12]\n\nThe cast was announced between March and August 2014, with [Idris\nElba](/wiki/Idris_Elba \"Idris Elba\") being announced to voice [Shere\nKhan](/wiki/Shere_Khan \"Shere Khan\") during early stages and [Bill\nMurray](/wiki/Bill_Murray \"Bill Murray\") eventually confirmed as the voice of\nBaloo in August 2014. Between then, [Scarlett\nJohansson](/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson \"Scarlett Johansson\"), [Ben\nKingsley](/wiki/Ben_Kingsley \"Ben Kingsley\"), and [Christopher\nWalken](/wiki/Christopher_Walken \"Christopher Walken\") were confirmed to play\n[Kaa](/wiki/Kaa \"Kaa\"), [Bagheera](/wiki/Bagheera \"Bagheera\"), and [King\nLouie](/wiki/King_Louie \"King Louie\").[14][15][16][17] Favreau decided to cast\nJohansson to play Kaa, originally a male character, as he felt the original\nfilm was \"a little too male-oriented.\"[18] Favreau and Marks noticed the lack\nof female characters in the 1967 film version and wanted to address that by\nfeaturing Raksha's character more prominently, as in Kipling's tales.[12]\n[Lupita Nyong'o](/wiki/Lupita_Nyong%27o \"Lupita Nyong'o\") was cast as\n[Raksha](/wiki/Raksha_\\(The_Jungle_Book\\) \"Raksha \\(The Jungle Book\\)\") as\nFavreau believed her voice imbued the emotion required for the role, \"Lupita\nhas tremendous depth of emotion in her performance. There's an emotional\nunderpinning she brings, and a strength, and we wanted that for this surrogate\nmother. Much of that comes from her voice.\"[19] Favreau also decided to change\nKing Louie from an [orangutan](/wiki/Orangutan \"Orangutan\") to a\n_[Gigantopithecus](/wiki/Gigantopithecus \"Gigantopithecus\")_ due to the fact\nthat orangutans are not native to [India](/wiki/India \"India\"), where the\nstory takes place.[7] His character was given a slight alteration from the\n1967 film and was partly inspired by [Marlon Brando](/wiki/Marlon_Brando\n\"Marlon Brando\")'s character [Colonel Kurtz](/wiki/Colonel_Kurtz \"Colonel\nKurtz\") in _Apocalypse Now_ ,[12] as well as incorporating Walken's own\nphysical mannerisms.[20] In regards to Louie's changes, Favreau stated, \"We\ncreated this looming figure that was trying to extract the secret of fire from\nMowgli. And also this gave Mowgli the idea that if he had fire, he could have\npower over Shere Khan, whether it was good or bad. So there was a  _[Lord of\nthe Rings](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings \"The Lord of the Rings\")_ aspect to\nthat; the fire was almost like the ring in that was going to give someone\nultimate power, but corrupt them as well as create destruction.\"[21] The film\nis dedicated to [Garry Shandling](/wiki/Garry_Shandling \"Garry Shandling\"),\nwho voiced a porcupine in the film and died of a heart attack before the\nfilm's release.\n\nThe search for casting [Mowgli](/wiki/Mowgli \"Mowgli\") was extensive, with\nthousands of children auditioning from the United States, the United Kingdom,\nNew Zealand, and Canada. Eventually, newcomer Neel Sethi was confirmed for the\nrole, with casting director Rebecca Williams describing him as embodying \"the\nheart, humor, and daring of the character. He's warm and accessible, yet also\nhas an intelligence well beyond his years and impressed us all with his\nability to hold his own in any situation.\"[22] Sethi underwent\n[parkour](/wiki/Parkour \"Parkour\") training in preparation for the role.[8]\n[Pixar Animation Studios](/wiki/Pixar \"Pixar\") assisted in the development of\nthe story, as well as providing suggestions for the film's end credits\nsequence.[23]\n\n### Filming and visual\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Jungle_Book_\\(2016_film\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Filming and visual effects\")]\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\ntook place entirely on sound stages at [L.A. Center\nStudios](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Center_Studios \"Los Angeles Center Studios\")[21] in\ndowntown [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\").[19][24] The animal\ncharacters were created entirely in [key frame](/wiki/Key_frame \"Key frame\")\n[computer animation](/wiki/Computer_animation \"Computer animation\"), with the\nassistance of footage of real animal movement, the actors recording their\nlines, and performance capture for reference.[7] The production team underwent\na thorough process to realistically convey the animals' speaking, while still\nmaking them perceptually believable to the audience. Favreau researched\nearlier films featuring anthropomorphic animals—including [Walt\nDisney](/wiki/Walt_Disney \"Walt Disney\")'s animated features, such as [_Snow\nWhite and the Seven\nDwarfs_](/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_\\(1937_film\\) \"Snow White and\nthe Seven Dwarfs \\(1937 film\\)\") and _[Bambi](/wiki/Bambi \"Bambi\")_ , as well\nas modern films such as [_Babe_](/wiki/Babe_\\(film\\) \"Babe \\(film\\)\")—and\nadopted certain techniques from those films into _The Jungle Book_.[21] Nearly\n70 separate species of animals native to India are featured in the film, with\nseveral species being portrayed as \"150% larger\" than their actual\ncounterparts.[21]\n\n[Jim Henson's Creature Shop](/wiki/Jim_Henson%27s_Creature_Shop \"Jim Henson's\nCreature Shop\") was brought in to provide animal puppet figures for Sethi to\nact against, although none appear in the finished film.[25] The animal puppets\nwere performed by Artie Esposito, Sean Johnson, [Allan\nTrautman](/wiki/Allan_Trautman \"Allan Trautman\"), and April Warren.[1] Favreau\nutilized [motion capture](/wiki/Motion_capture \"Motion capture\") with certain\nactors, expressing a desire to avoid overusing the technology in order to\nprevent evoking an [uncanny valley](/wiki/Uncanny_valley \"Uncanny valley\")\neffect.[7][18]\n\n[Moving Picture Company](/wiki/Moving_Picture_Company \"Moving Picture\nCompany\") (MPC) and [Weta Digital](/wiki/Weta_Digital \"Weta Digital\") created\nthe film's visual effects.[13] MPC developed new software for animating\nmuscular structure in the animals.[21] Around 1,000 remote jungle locations in\nIndia were photographed and used as reference in post-production.[26] Weta was\nresponsible for animating the King Louie sequence, with visual effects\nsupervisor Keith Miller adding that, \"It was important for Jon to see\nChristopher Walken in the creature.
