However, this power can be legislatively delegated by the\nstate to municipalities, government subdivisions, or even to private persons\nor corporations, when they are authorized by the legislature to exercise the\nfunctions of public character.[1]\n\nIn the Anglo-American historical context, property taken could be used only by\nthe government taking the property in question. The most common uses of\nproperty taken by eminent domain have been for roads, government buildings and\n[public utilities](/wiki/Public_utility \"Public utility\"). However, in the\nmid-20th century, a new application of eminent domain was pioneered, in which\nthe government could take the property and transfer it to a private third\nparty. This was initially done only to \"blighted\" property, on the principle\nthat such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners,\nbut was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the\nnew 3rd party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in\nincreased tax revenues to the government.\n\nSome jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the\nsubject property, before resorting to the use of eminent domain. However, once\nthe property is taken and the judgment is final, the condemnor owns it in [fee\nsimple](/wiki/Fee_simple \"Fee simple\"), and may put it to uses other than\nthose specified in the eminent domain action.\n\nTakings may be of the subject property in its entirety (total take) or in part\n(part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in fee\nsimple or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full fee\nsimple title).\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Meaning\n  * 2 North America\n    * 2.1 United States\n    * 2.2 Canada\n  * 3 Europe\n    * 3.1 France\n    * 3.2 England and Wales\n    * 3.3 Germany\n    * 3.4 Italy\n    * 3.5 Spain\n    * 3.6 Sweden\n  * 4 Australia\n  * 5 South America\n    * 5.1 Brazil\n    * 5.2 Chile\n  * 6 Asia\n    * 6.1 India\n    * 6.2 Pakistan\n  * 7 Other countries\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Meaning[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Meaning\")]\n\nThe term \"eminent domain\" was taken from the legal treatise _[De jure belli ac\npacis](/wiki/De_jure_belli_ac_pacis \"De jure belli ac pacis\")_ (On the Law of\nWar and Peace), written by the [Dutch](/wiki/Netherlands \"Netherlands\")\n[jurist](/wiki/Jurist \"Jurist\") [Hugo Grotius](/wiki/Hugo_Grotius \"Hugo\nGrotius\") in 1625,[2] which used the term _dominium eminens_\n([Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") for _supreme lordship_) and described the power\nas follows:\n\n> ... The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state, so\n> that the state or those who act for it may use and even alienate and destroy\n> such property, not only in the case of extreme necessity, in which even\n> private persons have a right over the property of others, but for ends of\n> public utility, to which ends those who founded civil society must be\n> supposed to have intended that private ends should give way. But, when this\n> is done, the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their\n> property.\n\nThe exercise of eminent domain is not limited to real property. Condemnors may\nalso take personal property, even intangible property such as\n[contract](/wiki/Contract \"Contract\") rights, [patents](/wiki/Patent\n\"Patent\"), [trade secrets](/wiki/Trade_secret \"Trade secret\"), and\n[copyrights](/wiki/Copyright \"Copyright\"). Even the taking of a\n[professional](/wiki/Professional_sports \"Professional sports\") [sports\nteam](/wiki/Sports_team \"Sports team\")'s franchise has been held by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court to be within the purview of the \"public use\"\nconstitutional limitation, although eventually, that taking (of the [Oakland\nRaiders](/wiki/Oakland_Raiders \"Oakland Raiders\")' [NFL](/wiki/NFL \"NFL\")\nfranchise) was not permitted because it was deemed to violate the interstate\ncommerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.[3]\n\nA taking of property must be accompanied by payment of \"just compensation\" to\nthe [former] owner. In theory, this is supposed to put the owner in the same\nposition \"pecuniarily\" that he would have been in had his property not been\ntaken. But in practice courts have limited compensation to the property's fair\nmarket value, considering its highest and best use. But though rarely granted,\nthis is not the exclusive measure of compensation; see [Kimball Laundry Co. v.\nUnited States](/wiki/Kimball_Laundry_Co._v._United_States \"Kimball Laundry Co.\nv. United States\") (business losses in temporary takings) and United States v.\nPewee Coal Co. (operating losses caused by government operations of a mine\nseized during World War II). In most takings owners are not compensated for a\nvariety of incidental losses caused by the taking of their property that,\nthough incurred and readily demonstrable in other cases, are deemed by the\ncourts to be noncompensable in eminent domain. The same is true of attorneys'\nand appraisers fees. But as a matter of legislative grace rather than\nconstitutional requirement some of these losses (e.g., business goodwill) have\nbeen made compensable by state legislative enactments, and may be partially\ncovered by provisions of the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance Act.\n\n## North\nAmerica[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: North America\")]\n\n### United\nStates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: United States\")]\n\nMain article: [Eminent domain in the United\nStates](/wiki/Eminent_domain_in_the_United_States \"Eminent domain in the\nUnited States\")\n\nMost states use the term _eminent domain_ , but some U.S. states use the term\n_[appropriation](/wiki/Appropriation_\\(economics\\) \"Appropriation\n\\(economics\\)\")_ (New York) or _expropriation_ (Louisiana) as synonyms for the\nexercise of eminent domain powers.[4][5] The term _condemnation_ is used to\ndescribe the formal act of exercising this power to transfer title or some\nlesser interest in the subject property.\n\nThe constitutionally required \"just compensation\" in partial takings is\nusually measured by fair market value of the part taken, plus severance\ndamages (the diminution in value of the property retained by the owner\n[remainder] when only a part of the subject property is taken). Where a\npartial taking provides economic benefits specific to the remainder, those\nmust be deducted, typically from severance damages.[6] The former owners of\nthe property rarely receive full market value because some elements of value\nare deemed noncompensable in eminent domain law.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe practice of condemnation came to the American colonies with the [common\nlaw](/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\"). When it came time to draft the [United\nStates Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States\nConstitution\"), differing views on eminent domain were voiced. The [Fifth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Fifth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") to the Constitution requires\nthat the taking be for a \"public use\" and mandates payment of \"just\ncompensation\" to the owner.[7]\n\nIn federal law, Congress may take private property directly (without recourse\nto the courts) by passing an Act transferring title of the subject property\ndirectly to the government. In such cases, the property owner seeking\ncompensation must sue the United States for compensation in the U.S. Court of\nFederal Claims. The legislature may also delegate the power to private\nentities like public utilities or railroads, and even to individuals.[8] The\n[U.S. Supreme Court](/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court \"U.S. Supreme Court\") has\nconsistently deferred to the right of states to make their own determinations\nof \"public use\".\n\n### Canada[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Canada\")]\n\nIn Canada, expropriation is governed by federal or provincial statutes. Under\nthese statutory regimes, public authorities have the right to acquire private\nproperty for public purposes, so long as the acquisition is approved by the\nappropriate government body. Once a property is taken, an owner is entitled to\n\"be made whole\" by compensation for: the market value of the expropriated\nproperty, injurious affection to the remainder of the property (if any),\ndisturbance damages, business loss, and special difficulty relocating. Owners\ncan advance claims for compensation above that initially provided by the\nexpropriating authority by bringing a claim before the court or an\nadministrative body appointed by the governing legislation.\n\n## Europe[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Europe\")]\n\nIn many European nations, the [European Convention on Human\nRights](/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights \"European Convention on\nHuman Rights\") provides protection from an appropriation of private property\nby the state. Article 8 of the Convention provides that \"Everyone has the\nright to respect for his private and family life, his home, and his\ncorrespondence\" and prohibits interference with this right by the state,\nunless the interference is in accordance with law and necessary in the\ninterests of [national security](/wiki/National_security \"National security\"),\npublic safety, economic well-being of the country, prevention of disorder or\ncrime, protection of health or morals, or protection of the rights and\nfreedoms of others. This right is expanded by Article 1 of the [First\nProtocol](/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights#toc \"European Convention\non Human Rights\") to the Convention, which states that \"Every natural person\nor legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.\"\nAgain, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private\npossessions is in the general or [public interest](/wiki/Public_interest\n\"Public interest\"), is in accordance with law, and, in particular, to secure\npayment of [taxes](/wiki/Tax \"Tax\"). Settled case-law of ECHR provides that\njust compensation has to be paid in cases of expropriation.[9]\n\n### France[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: France\")]\n\nIn [France](/wiki/France \"France\"), the [Declaration of the Rights of Man and\nof the Citizen](/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen\n\"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\") similarly mandates just\nand preliminary compensation before expropriation; and a [Déclaration\nd'utilité publique](/wiki/D%C3%A9claration_d%27utilit%C3%A9_publique\n\"Déclaration d'utilité publique\") is commonly required, to demonstrate a\npublic benefit.\n\nNotably, in 1945, by decree of General [Charles de\nGaulle](/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle \"Charles de Gaulle\") based on untried[10]\naccusations of collaboration, the [Renault](/wiki/Renault \"Renault\") company\nwas expropriated from Louis Renault posthumously and nationalised as _Régie\nNationale des Usines Renault_[10]—without compensation.[11]\n\n### England and\nWales[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: England and Wales\")]\n\nMain article: [Compulsory purchase in England and\nWales](/wiki/Compulsory_purchase_in_England_and_Wales \"Compulsory purchase in\nEngland and Wales\")\n\nAfter his victory in 1066, [William the Conqueror](/wiki/William_the_Conqueror\n\"William the Conqueror\") seized virtually all land in England. Although he\nmaintained absolute power over the land, he granted fiefs to landholders who\nserved as stewards, paying fees and providing military services. During the\n[Hundred Years War](/wiki/Hundred_Years_War \"Hundred Years War\") in the 14th\ncentury, [Edward III](/wiki/Edward_III_of_England \"Edward III of England\")\nused the Crown's right of [purveyance](/wiki/Purveyance \"Purveyance\") for\nmassive expropriations. Chapter 28 of [Magna Carta](/wiki/Magna_Carta \"Magna\nCarta\") required that immediate cash payment be made for expropriations. As\nthe king's power was broken down in the ensuing centuries, tenants were\nregarded as holding ownership rights rather than merely possessory rights over\ntheir land. In 1427, a statute was passed granting commissioners of sewers in\n[Lincolnshire](/wiki/Lincolnshire \"Lincolnshire\") the power to take land\nwithout compensation. After the early 16th century, however, Parliamentary\ntakings of land for roads, bridges, etc. generally did require compensation.\nThe common practice was to pay 10% more than the assessed value. However, as\nthe voting franchise was expanded to include more non-landowners, the bonus\nwas eliminated. In spite of contrary statements found in some American law, in\nthe United Kingdom, compulsory purchase valuation cases were tried to juries\nwell into the 20th century, such as [Attorney-General v De Keyser’s Royal\nHotel Ltd](/w/index.php?title=Attorney-\nGeneral_v_De_Keyser%E2%80%99s_Royal_Hotel_Ltd&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Attorney-\nGeneral v De Keyser’s Royal Hotel Ltd \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1919).\n\nIn [England and Wales](/wiki/England_and_Wales \"England and Wales\"), and other\njurisdictions that follow the principles of [English law](/wiki/English_law\n\"English law\"), the related term **compulsory purchase** is used. The\nlandowner is compensated with a price agreed or stipulated by an appropriate\nperson. Where agreement on price cannot be achieved, the value of the taken\nland is determined by the [Upper Tribunal](/wiki/Upper_Tribunal \"Upper\nTribunal\"). The operative law is a patchwork of statutes and case law. The\nprincipal Acts are the [Lands Clauses Consolidation Act\n1845](/w/index.php?title=Lands_Clauses_Consolidation_Act_1845&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 \\(page does not exist\\)\"), the [Land\nCompensation Act 1961](/wiki/Land_Compensation_Act_1961 \"Land Compensation Act\n1961\"), the [Compulsory Purchase Act 1965](/wiki/Compulsory_Purchase_Act_1965\n\"Compulsory Purchase Act 1965\"), the [Land Compensation Act\n1973](/w/index.php?title=Land_Compensation_Act_1973&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Land Compensation Act 1973 \\(page does not exist\\)\"), the Acquisition of Land\nAct 1981, part IX of the [Town and Country Planning Act\n1990](/wiki/Town_and_Country_Planning_Act_1990 \"Town and Country Planning Act\n1990\"), the [Planning and Compensation Act\n1991](/wiki/Planning_and_Compensation_Act_1991 \"Planning and Compensation Act\n1991\"), and the [Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act\n2004](/wiki/Planning_and_Compulsory_Purchase_Act_2004 \"Planning and Compulsory\nPurchase Act 2004\").\n\n### Germany[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Germany\")]\n\nThe [Basic Law for the Federal Republic of\nGermany](/wiki/Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany \"Basic Law for\nthe Federal Republic of Germany\") states in its Article 14 (3) that \"an\nexpropriation is only allowed for the public good\"[12] and just compensation\nmust be made.

Also other national and regional laws may apply, not\nalways giving a full compensation to the owner.[15] Expropriation can be total\n(the whole property is expropriated) or partial; permanent or temporary.\n\nThe article 42 of the [Italian Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy\n\"Constitution of Italy\") and the article 834 of the [Italian Civil\nCode](/wiki/Law_of_Italy \"Law of Italy\") state that a private good can be\nexpropriated for public utility. Furthermore, the article 2 of the\nConstitution binds Italian citizens to respect their _mandatory duties of\npolitical, economical and social solidarity_.\n\nThe implementation of the eminent domain follows two principles[16]:\n\n  * legality: a public institution can exporpriate private goods only in the cases law allowes it and respecting its procedures (following the article 23 of the [Italian Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy \"Constitution of Italy\"));\n  * compensation: (art. 42/III) the State must provide a certain amount of money as compensation, which is determined by the law. According to the [Italian Constitutional Court](/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Italy \"Constitutional Court of Italy\"), this compensation is not required to be equal to the market value of the expropriated good, although this sum must not be merely symbolic.\n\n_Nazionalizzazione_ (\"nationalization\"), instead, is provided for by article\n43 of the Constitution; it transfers to governmental authority and property a\nwhole industrial sector, if it is deemed to be a natural or de facto\n[monopoly](/wiki/Monopoly \"Monopoly\"), and an essential service of public\nutility. The most famous nationalization in Italy was the [1962\nnationalization of the electrical power sector](/wiki/Enel \"Enel\").\n\n### Spain[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Spain\")]\n\nArticle 33.3 of the [Spanish Constitution of\n1978](/wiki/Spanish_Constitution_of_1978 \"Spanish Constitution of 1978\")\nallows forced expropriation (\"expropiación forzosa\") only where justified on\nthe grounds of public utility or social interest and subject to the payment of\nappropriate compensation as provided for in law.[17]\n\n### Sweden[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Sweden\")]\n\nExpropriation. The right of state or municipality to buy property when it is\ndetermined to be of \"particular public interest\", is regulated in\nExpropriationslagen (1972:719).[18] The government purchases the property at\nan estimated market value plus a 25% compensation. The law also states that\nthe property owner shall not suffer economic harm because of the\nexpropriation.\n\n## Australia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Australia\")]\n\nMain article: [Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian\nConstitution](/wiki/Section_51\\(xxxi\\)_of_the_Australian_Constitution \"Section\n51\\(xxxi\\) of the Australian Constitution\")\n\nIn Australia, section 51(xxxi) of the [Australian\nConstitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Australia \"Constitution of Australia\")\npermits the [Commonwealth Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia\n\"Parliament of Australia\") to make laws with respect to \"the acquisition of\nproperty on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of\nwhich the Parliament has power to make laws.\"[19] This has been construed as\nmeaning that just compensation may not always include monetary or proprietary\nrecompense, rather it is for the court to determine what is just. It may be\nnecessary to imply a need for compensation in the interests of justice, lest\nthe law be invalidated.[20]\n\nProperty subject to resumption is not restricted to real estate as authority\nfrom the [Federal Court](/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia \"Federal Court of\nAustralia\") has extended the states' power to resume property to any form of\nphysical property.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] For the purposes of section 51(xxxi), money is\nnot property that may be compulsorily acquired.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] (The\nfollowing is cited by a dead link) A statutory right to sue has been\nconsidered \"property\" under this section.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe Commonwealth must also derive some benefit from the property acquired,\nthat is, the Commonwealth can \"only legislate for the acquisition of Property\nfor particular purposes\".[21] Accordingly, the power does not extend to allow\nlegislation designed merely to seek to extinguish the previous owner's\ntitle.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] The states and territories' powers of resumption on the other hand\nare not so limited. The section 43(1) of the Lands Acquisition Act 1998 (NT)\ngrants the Minister the power to acquire land 'for any purpose whatever'.[22]\nThe High Court of Australia interpreted this provision literally, relieving\nthe Territory government of any public purpose limitation on the power.[23]\nThis finding permitted the Territory government to acquire land subject to\nNative Title, effectively extinguishing the Native Title interest in the land.\nKirby J in dissent, along with a number of commentators, viewed this as a\nmissed opportunity to comment on the exceptional nature of powers of\nresumption exercised in the absence of a public purpose limitation.[24]\n\nThe term _resumption_ is a reflection of the fact that, as a matter of\nAustralian law, all land was originally owned by [the Crown](/wiki/The_Crown\n\"The Crown\") before it was sold, leased or granted[25] and that, through the\nact of compulsory acquisition, the Crown is \"resuming\" possession.\n\n## South\nAmerica[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: South America\")]\n\n### Brazil[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Brazil\")]\n\nBrazil's expropriation laws are governed by the Presidential Decree No. 3365\nof July 21, 1941.[26]\n\n### Chile[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Chile\")]\n\nArt. 19, No. 24, of the [Chilean Constitution](/wiki/Chilean_Constitution\n\"Chilean Constitution\") says in part, \"In no case may anyone be deprived of\nhis property, of the assets affected or any of the essential faculties or\npowers of ownership, except by virtue of a general or a special law which\nauthorizes expropriation for the public benefit or the national interest, duly\nqualified by the legislator.

Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to 'acquire, hold and\ndispose of property'. Article 31 provided that \"No person shall be deprived of\nhis property save by authority of law.\" It also provided that compensation\nwould be paid to a person whose property had been 'taken possession of or\nacquired' for public purposes. In addition, both the state government as well\nas the union (federal) government were empowered to enact laws for the\n\"acquisition or requisition of property\" (Schedule VII, Entry 42, List III).\nIt is this provision that has been interpreted as being the source of the\nstate's 'eminent domain' powers.[28]\n\nThe provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of\ntimes. The 44th [amendment](/wiki/Constitution_of_India#Amendment\n\"Constitution of India\") act of 1978 deleted the right to property from the\nlist of Fundamental Rights.[29] A new article, Article 300-A, was added to the\nconstitution to provide, \"No person shall be deprived of his property save by\nauthority of law.\" Thus, if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of\nhis property, it will not be unconstitutional. The aggrieved person shall have\nno right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no\nlonger a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the\ngovernment appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a\ncourt of law by citizens.[30]\n\nLand acquisition in India is currently governed by [The Right to Fair\nCompensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and\nResettlement Act,\n2013](/wiki/The_Right_to_Fair_Compensation_and_Transparency_in_Land_Acquisition,_Rehabilitation_and_Resettlement_Act,_2013\n\"The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,\nRehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013\"), which came into force from 1\nJanuary 2014.[31] Until 2013, land acquisition in India was governed by [Land\nAcquisition Act of 1894](/wiki/Land_Acquisition_Act,_1894 \"Land Acquisition\nAct, 1894\").[32] However the new LARR (amendment) ordinance 31 December 2014\ndiluted many clauses of the original act.[33] The liberalisation of the\neconomy and the Government's initiative to set up special economic zones have\nled to many protests by farmers and have opened up a debate on the\nreinstatement of the fundamental right to private property.[34]\n\n### Pakistan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Pakistan\")]\n\nUnder the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the government has the power to\ncompulsorily acquire private land at the prevailing market rate for public\npurposes such as roads, highways, railways, dams, airports, etc.\n\n## Other\ncountries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Other countries\")]\n\nMany countries recognize eminent domain to a much lesser extent than the\nEnglish-speaking world or do not recognize it at all. [Japan](/wiki/Japan\n\"Japan\"), for instance, has very weak eminent domain powers, as evidenced by\nthe high-profile opposition to the expansion of [Narita International\nAirport](/wiki/Narita_International_Airport \"Narita International Airport\"),\nand the disproportionately large amounts of financial inducement given to\nresidents on sites slated for redevelopment in return for their agreement to\nleave, one well-known recent case being that of [Roppongi\nHills](/wiki/Roppongi_Hills \"Roppongi Hills\").\n\nThere are other countries such as the [People's Republic of\nChina](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China \"People's Republic of China\") that\npractice eminent domain whenever it is convenient to make space for new\ncommunities and government structures. [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore\n\"Singapore\") practices eminent domain under the Land Acquisitions Act, which\nallows it to carry out its [Selective En bloc Redevelopment\nScheme](/wiki/Selective_En_bloc_Redevelopment_Scheme \"Selective En bloc\nRedevelopment Scheme\") for urban renewal. The [Amendments to the Land Titles\nAct](/w/index.php?title=Amendments_to_the_Land_Titles_Act&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Amendments to the Land Titles Act \\(page does not exist\\)\") allowed property\nto be purchased for purposes of urban renewal against an owner sharing a\ncollective title if the majority of the other owners wish to sell and the\nminority did not. Thus, eminent domain often invokes concerns of\n[majoritarianism](/wiki/Majoritarianism \"Majoritarianism\").\n\nIn the Bahamas, the Acquisition of Land Act operates to permit the acquisition\nof land where it is deemed likely to be required for a public purpose. The\nland can be acquired by private agreement or compulsory purchase (s7 of the\nAct). Under section 24 of the Acquisition of Land Act, the purchaser may\npurchase the interest of the mortgagee of any land acquired under the Act. To\ndo so, the purchaser must pay the principal sum and interest, together with\ncosts and charges plus 6 months’ additional interest.\n\nSince the 1990s, the [Zimbabwean](/wiki/Zimbabwe \"Zimbabwe\") government under\n[Robert Mugabe](/wiki/Robert_Mugabe \"Robert Mugabe\") has seized a great deal\nof land and homes of mainly white farmers in the course of the [land reform\nmovement in Zimbabwe](/wiki/Land_reform_in_Zimbabwe \"Land reform in\nZimbabwe\"). The government argued that such land reform was necessary to\nredistribute the land to Zimbabweans dispossessed of their lands during\n[colonialism](/wiki/Colonialism \"Colonialism\") – these farmers were never\ncompensated for this seizure.[35]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Angary](/wiki/Angary \"Angary\")\n  * [Confiscation](/wiki/Confiscation \"Confiscation\")\n  * [Individual reclamation](/wiki/Individual_reclamation \"Individual reclamation\")\n  * [Land bonds](/wiki/Land_bonds \"Land bonds\")\n  * [Legal plunder](/wiki/Legal_plunder \"Legal plunder\")\n  * [Navigable servitude](/wiki/Navigable_servitude \"Navigable servitude\")\n  * [Public use](/wiki/Public_use \"Public use\")\n  * [Water law](/wiki/Water_law \"Water law\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Eminent_domain&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Eminent Domain\"](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/eminent+domain). _The Free Dictionary_.
