Mozart was a close friend of one of the\nsinger-composers of the troupe, tenor [Benedikt Schack](/wiki/Benedikt_Schack\n\"Benedikt Schack\") (the first Tamino), and had contributed to the compositions\nof the troupe, which were often collaboratively written. Mozart's\nparticipation increased with his contributions to the 1790 collaborative opera\n_[Der Stein der Weisen](/wiki/Der_Stein_der_Weisen \"Der Stein der Weisen\")_\n(_The Philosopher 's Stone_), including the duet (\"Nun liebes Weibchen\", K.\n625/592a) among other passages. Like _The Magic Flute_ , _Der Stein der\nWeisen_ was a fairy-tale opera and can be considered a kind of precursor; it\nemployed much the same cast in similar roles.[2]\n\nThe [libretto for _The Magic Flute_](/wiki/Libretto_of_The_Magic_Flute\n\"Libretto of The Magic Flute\"), written by Schikaneder, is thought by scholars\nto be based on many sources. Some works of literature current in Vienna in\nSchikaneder's day that may have served as sources include the medieval romance\n_[Yvain](/wiki/Yvain \"Yvain\")_ by [Chrétien de\nTroyes](/wiki/Chr%C3%A9tien_de_Troyes \"Chrétien de Troyes\"), the novel\n_[Sethos](/wiki/Sethos \"Sethos\")_ by [Jean Terrasson](/wiki/Jean_Terrasson\n\"Jean Terrasson\"), and the essay \"On the mysteries of the Egyptians\" by [Ignaz\nvon Born](/wiki/Ignaz_von_Born \"Ignaz von Born\"). The libretto is also a\nnatural continuation of a series of fairy tale operas produced at the time by\nSchikaneder's troupe, including an adaptation of [Sophie\nSeyler](/wiki/Sophie_Seyler \"Sophie Seyler\")'s Singspiel\n_[Oberon](/wiki/Oberon_\\(Seyler\\) \"Oberon \\(Seyler\\)\")_ as well as _Der Stein\nder Weisen_.[3] Especially for the role of Papageno, the libretto draws on the\n[Hanswurst](/wiki/Hanswurst \"Hanswurst\") tradition of the Viennese popular\ntheatre. Many scholars also acknowledge an influence of\n[Freemasonry](/wiki/Freemasonry \"Freemasonry\"). For detailed discussion of\nsources see Branscombe (1991), as well as _[Libretto of The Magic\nFlute](/wiki/Libretto_of_The_Magic_Flute \"Libretto of The Magic Flute\")_.\n\nIn composing the opera, Mozart evidently kept in mind the skills of the\nsingers intended for the premiere, which included both virtuosi and ordinary\ncomic actors asked to sing for the occasion. Thus, the vocal lines for\nPapageno—sung by Schikaneder himself—and Monostatos ([Johann Joseph\nNouseul](/wiki/Johann_Joseph_Nouseul \"Johann Joseph Nouseul\")) are often\nstated first in the strings so the singer can find his pitch, and are\nfrequently doubled by instruments. In contrast, Mozart's sister-in-law\n[Josepha Hofer](/wiki/Josepha_Hofer \"Josepha Hofer\"), who premiered the role\nof the Queen of the Night, evidently needed little such help: this role is\nfamous for its difficulty. In ensembles, Mozart skillfully combined voices of\ndifferent ability levels.\n\nThe [vocal ranges](/wiki/Vocal_range \"Vocal range\") of two of the original\nsingers for whom Mozart tailored his music have posed challenges for many\nsingers who have since recreated their roles. Both arias of the Queen of the\nNight, \"[O zittre nicht, mein lieber\nSohn](/wiki/O_zittre_nicht,_mein_lieber_Sohn \"O zittre nicht, mein lieber\nSohn\")\" and \"[Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem\nHerzen](/wiki/Der_H%C3%B6lle_Rache_kocht_in_meinem_Herzen \"Der Hölle Rache\nkocht in meinem Herzen\")\" require [high](/wiki/In_alt \"In alt\")\n[F6](/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation \"Scientific pitch notation\"), rare in\nopera. At the low end, the part of Sarastro, premiered by [Franz Xaver\nGerl](/wiki/Franz_Xaver_Gerl \"Franz Xaver Gerl\"), includes a conspicuous F2 in\na few locations.\n\n## Premiere and\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Magic_Flute&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Premiere and reception\")]\n\nThe opera was premiered in Vienna on 30 September 1791 at the suburban\n[Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden](/wiki/Theater_auf_der_Wieden \"Theater auf\nder Wieden\").[4] Mozart conducted the orchestra,[b] Schikaneder himself played\nPapageno, while the role of the Queen of the Night was sung by Mozart's\nsister-in-law [Josepha Hofer](/wiki/Josepha_Weber \"Josepha Weber\").\n\nOn the reception of the opera, Mozart scholar [Maynard\nSolomon](/wiki/Maynard_Solomon \"Maynard Solomon\") writes:\n\n> Although there were no reviews of the first performances,[6] it was\n> immediately evident that Mozart and Schikaneder had achieved a great\n> success, the opera drawing immense crowds and reaching hundreds of\n> performances during the 1790s.[7]\n\nAs Mozart's letters show, he was very pleased to have achieved such a success.\nSolomon continues:\n\n> Mozart's delight is reflected in his last three letters, written to\n> [Constanze](/wiki/Constanze_Mozart \"Constanze Mozart\"), who with her sister\n> Sophie was spending the second week of October in\n> [Baden](/wiki/Baden_bei_Wien \"Baden bei Wien\"). \"I have this moment returned\n> from the opera, which was as full as ever\", he wrote on 7 October, listing\n> the numbers that had to be encored. \"But what always gives me the most\n> pleasure is the _silent approval_! You can see how this opera is becoming\n> more and more esteemed.\" … He went to hear his opera almost every night,\n> taking along [friends and] relatives.[7]\n\nThe opera celebrated its 100th performance in November 1792, though Mozart did\nnot have the pleasure of witnessing this milestone, as he had died 5 December\n1791. The opera was first performed outside Vienna (21 September 1792) in\n[Lemberg](/wiki/Lviv \"Lviv\"),[8] then in\n[Prague](/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart_and_Prague \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and\nPrague\"). It then made (Branscombe) \"triumphal progress through Germany's\nopera houses great and small\",[9] and with the early 19th century spread to\nessentially all the countries of Europe—and eventually, everywhere in the\nworld—where opera is cultivated.[10]\n\nAs Branscombe documents, the earlier performances were often of highly\naltered, sometimes even mutilated, versions of the opera (see _[Ludwig Wenzel\nLachnith](/wiki/Ludwig_Wenzel_Lachnith \"Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith\")_).\nProductions of the past century have tended to be more faithful to Mozart's\nmusic, though faithful rendering of Mozart and Schikaneder's original (quite\nexplicit) stage directions and dramatic vision continues to be rare; with\nisolated exceptions, modern productions strongly reflect the creative\npreferences of the stage director.[11]\n\n_The Magic Flute_ is presently among the most frequently performed of all\noperas; statistics collected for the 2015-2016 season indicate over 500\nproductions worldwide, totaling more than 3000 performances.[12]\n\n## First\npublication[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Magic_Flute&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: First publication\")]\n\nOn 28 December 1791, three and a half weeks after Mozart's death, his widow\nConstanze offered to send a manuscript score of _The Magic Flute_ to the\nelectoral court in [Bonn](/wiki/Bonn \"Bonn\"). [Nikolaus\nSimrock](/wiki/Nikolaus_Simrock \"Nikolaus Simrock\") published this text in the\nfirst full-score edition (Bonn, 1814), claiming that it was \"in accordance\nwith Mozart's own wishes\" (_[Allgemeine musikalische\nZeitung](/wiki/Allgemeine_musikalische_Zeitung \"Allgemeine musikalische\nZeitung\")_ , 13 September 1815).[13][14]\n\n## Themes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Magic_Flute&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Themes\")]\n\nMain article: [Libretto of The Magic Flute](/wiki/Libretto_of_The_Magic_Flute\n\"Libretto of The Magic Flute\")\n\nSee also: [Mozart and Freemasonry](/wiki/Mozart_and_Freemasonry \"Mozart and\nFreemasonry\")\n\n_The Magic Flute_ is noted for its prominent [Masonic](/wiki/Freemasonry\n\"Freemasonry\") elements,[15] although some scholars hold that the Masonic\ninfluence is exaggerated.[16][17][18] Schikaneder and Mozart were Freemasons,\nas was [Ignaz Alberti](/wiki/Ignaz_Alberti \"Ignaz Alberti\"), engraver and\nprinter of the first libretto.[19] The opera is also influenced by\n[Enlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment \"Age of Enlightenment\") philosophy,\nand can be regarded as an allegory advocating [enlightened\nabsolutism](/wiki/Enlightened_absolutism \"Enlightened absolutism\"). The Queen\nof the Night represents a dangerous form of [obscurantism](/wiki/Obscurantism\n\"Obscurantism\") or, according to some, the anti-Masonic Roman Catholic\n[Empress Maria Theresa](/wiki/Maria_Theresa \"Maria Theresa\"),[20] or,\naccording to others, the contemporary Roman Catholic Church itself, which was\nalso [strongly anti-Masonic](/wiki/Papal_ban_of_Freemasonry \"Papal ban of\nFreemasonry\").[21] Her antagonist Sarastro symbolises the enlightened\nsovereign who rules according to principles based on reason, wisdom, and\nnature. The story itself portrays the education of mankind, progressing from\nchaos (the serpent) through religious superstition (the Queen and Ladies) to\nrationalistic enlightenment (Sarastro and Priests), by means of trial (Tamino)\nand error (Papageno), ultimately to make \"the Earth a heavenly kingdom, and\nmortals like the gods\" (\"Dann ist die Erd' ein Himmelreich, und Sterbliche den\nGöttern gleich\"); this couplet is sung in the finales to both acts.\n\nModern audiences often find the prominent strains of [misogyny](/wiki/Misogyny\n\"Misogyny\") and the casual [racism](/wiki/Racism \"Racism\") in _The Magic\nFlute_ problematic.[22] Sarastro describes the Queen of the Night as usurping\nthe rightful power of men (\"[She is] a proud woman! A man must guide your\nhearts, for without him all women tend to step outside their own sphere of\nactivity\"), and her supposed 'feminine' vindictive hysteria serves as a foil\nfor Sarastro's 'masculine' dignified reason. The perfidious villain\nMonostatos, meanwhile, is written as a [Moor](/wiki/Moors \"Moors\") (African).\n\n## Roles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Magic_Flute&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Roles\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Zauberfl%C3%B6te-\nTheaterzettel1791.jpg/220px-Zauberfl%C3%B6te-\nTheaterzettel1791.jpg)](/wiki/File:Zauberfl%C3%B6te-Theaterzettel1791.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Zauberfl%C3%B6te-Theaterzettel1791.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPlaybill for the premiere, 30 September 1791.[c]\n\nRole | [Voice type](/wiki/Voice_type \"Voice type\") | Premiere cast, 30 September 1791  \n([conductor](/wiki/Conducting \"Conducting\"): Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)  \n---|---|---  \nTamino | [tenor](/wiki/Tenor \"Tenor\") | [Benedikt Schack](/wiki/Benedikt_Schack \"Benedikt Schack\")  \nPapageno | [baritone](/wiki/Baritone \"Baritone\") | [Emanuel Schikaneder](/wiki/Emanuel_Schikaneder \"Emanuel Schikaneder\")  \nPamina | [soprano](/wiki/Soprano \"Soprano\") | [Anna Gottlieb](/wiki/Anna_Gottlieb \"Anna Gottlieb\")  \nThe Queen of the Night[d] | soprano | [Josepha Hofer](/wiki/Josepha_Weber \"Josepha Weber\")  \nSarastro | [bass](/wiki/Bass_\\(voice_type\\) \"Bass \\(voice type\\)\") | [Franz Xaver Gerl](/wiki/Franz_Xaver_Gerl \"Franz Xaver Gerl\")  \nThree ladies | 3 sopranos | Mlle Klöpfer, Mlle Hofmann, Elisabeth[23] Schack  \nMonostatos | tenor | [Johann Joseph Nouseul](/wiki/Johann_Joseph_Nouseul \"Johann Joseph Nouseul\")  \nThree child-spirits | [treble](/wiki/Boy_soprano \"Boy soprano\"), [alto](/wiki/Alto \"Alto\"), [mezzo-soprano](/wiki/Mezzo-soprano \"Mezzo-soprano\")[e] | [Anna Schikaneder](/wiki/Emanuel_Schikaneder#Early_life_and_family \"Emanuel Schikaneder\"); Anselm Handelgruber; Franz Anton Maurer  \nSpeaker of the temple | [bass-baritone](/wiki/Bass-baritone \"Bass-baritone\") | Herr Winter  \nThree priests | bass, tenor, speaking role | Johann Michael Kistler, [Urban Schikaneder](/wiki/Emanuel_Schikaneder#Early_life_and_family \"Emanuel Schikaneder\")  \nPapagena | soprano | [Barbara Gerl](/wiki/Franz_Xaver_Gerl#Family \"Franz Xaver Gerl\")  \nTwo armoured men | tenor, bass | Johann Michael Kistler, Herr Moll  \nThree slaves | 2 tenors, bass | [Karl Ludwig Giesecke](/wiki/Karl_Ludwig_Giesecke \"Karl Ludwig Giesecke\"), Herr Frasel, Herr Starke  \n_Priests, women, people, slaves, chorus_  \n  \nThe names of the performers at the premiere are taken from [a preserved\nplaybill for this performance](/wiki/File:Zauberfl%C3%B6te-\nTheaterzettel1791.jpg \"File:Zauberflöte-Theaterzettel1791.jpg\") (at right),\nwhich does not give full names; \"Hr.\" = Herr, Mr.; \"Mme.\" = Madame, Mrs.;\n\"Mlle.\" = Mademoiselle, Miss.[24][25]\n\nWhile the female roles in the opera are assigned to different [voice\ntypes](/wiki/Voice_type \"Voice type\"), the playbill for the premiere\nperformance referred to all of the female singers as \"sopranos\".

It also requires a four-part\n[chorus](/wiki/Choir \"Choir\") for several numbers (notably the finales of each\nact). Mozart also called for a _stromento d 'acciaio_ (instrument of steel) to\nperform Papageno's magic bells; an instrument which has since been lost to\nhistory, though modern day scholars believe it to be a [keyed\nglockenspiel](/wiki/Keyboard_glockenspiel \"Keyboard glockenspiel\"), which is\nusually substituted with a [celesta](/wiki/Celesta \"Celesta\") in modern-day\nperformances.[27]\n\n[Charles Rosen](/wiki/Charles_Rosen \"Charles Rosen\") has remarked on the\ncharacter of Mozart's orchestration:\n\n> _Die Zauberflöte_ has the greatest variety of orchestral color that the\n> eighteenth century was to know; the very lavishness, however, is\n> paradoxically also an economy as each effect is a concentrated one, each\n> one—Papageno's whistle, the Queen of the Night's coloratura, the bells,\n> Sarastro's trombones, even the farewell in Scene I for clarinets and\n> pizzicato strings—a single dramatic stroke.\"[28]\n\n## Synopsis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Magic_Flute&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Synopsis\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-audio-openclipart.svg.png) |  [Overture](/wiki/File:Mozart_-_Magic_Flute_Overture.ogg \"File:Mozart - Magic Flute Overture.ogg\") ![](data:image/png,%89PNG%0D%0A%1A%0A%00%00%00%0DIHDR%00%00%00%01%00%00%00%01%08%02%00%00%00%90wS%DE%00%00%00%01sRGB%00%AE%CE%1C%E9%00%00%00%09pHYs%00%00%0B%13%00%00%0B%13%01%00%9A%9C%18%00%00%00%07tIME%07%DB%0B%0A%17%041%80%9B%E7%F2%00%00%00%19tEXtComment%00Created%20with%20GIMPW%81%0E%17%00%00%00%0CIDAT%08%D7c%60%60%60%00%00%00%04%00%01'4'%0A%00%00%00%00IEND%AEB%60%82)[](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Mozart_-_Magic_Flute_Overture.ogg) Performed by [Musopen Symphony Orchestra](/wiki/Musopen \"Musopen\") (6:39)  \n---|---  \n  \n* * *\n\n_Problems playing this file?

He describes his life as a bird-catcher, complaining he has\nno wife or girlfriend (aria: \"Der Vogelfänger bin ich ja\"). Tamino introduces\nhimself to Papageno, thinking Papageno killed the serpent. Papageno happily\ntakes the credit – claiming he strangled it with his bare hands. The three\nladies suddenly reappear and instead of giving him wine, cake and figs, they\ngive him water, a stone and place a padlock over his mouth as a warning not to\nlie. They give Tamino a portrait of the Queen of the Night's daughter Pamina,\nwith whom Tamino falls instantly in love (aria: \"[Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd\nschön](/wiki/Dies_Bildnis_ist_bezaubernd_sch%C3%B6n \"Dies Bildnis ist\nbezaubernd schön\")\" / This image is enchantingly beautiful).\n\nThe ladies return and tell Tamino that Pamina has been captured by Sarastro, a\nsupposedly evil sorcerer.

Tamino approaches the left-hand\nentrance and is denied access by voices from within. The same happens when he\ngoes to the entrance on the right. But from the entrance in the middle, an old\npriest appears and lets Tamino in. (The old priest is referred to as \"The\nSpeaker\" in the libretto, but his role is a singing role.) He tells Tamino\nthat Sarastro is benevolent, not evil, and that he should not trust the Queen\nof the Night. He promises that Tamino's confusion will be lifted when Tamino\napproaches the temple as a friend. Tamino plays his magic flute. Animals\nappear and dance, enraptured, to his music.

(chorus: \"Es lebe Sarastro!\")\n\nPamina falls at Sarastro's feet and confesses that she tried to escape because\nMonostatos had forced his attentions on her. Sarastro receives her kindly and\nassures her that he wishes only for her happiness. But he refuses to return\nher to her mother, whom he describes as a proud, headstrong woman, and a bad\ninfluence on those around her. Pamina, he says, must be guided by a man.\n\nMonostatos brings in Tamino. The two lovers see one another for the first time\nand embrace, causing indignation among Sarastro's followers. Monostatos tells\nSarastro that he caught Papageno and Pamina trying to escape, and demands a\nreward. Sarastro, however, punishes Monostatos for his lustful behaviour\ntoward Pamina, and sends him away. He announces that Tamino must undergo\ntrials of wisdom in order to become worthy as Pamina's husband. The priests\ndeclare that virtue and righteousness will sanctify life and make mortals like\ngods (\"Wenn Tugend und Gerechtigkeit\").\n\n### Act 2[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Magic_Flute&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Act 2\")]\n\n_Scene 1: A grove of palms_\n\nThe council of priests of [Isis](/wiki/Isis \"Isis\") and [Osiris](/wiki/Osiris\n\"Osiris\"), headed by Sarastro, enters to the sound of a solemn march. Sarastro\ntells the priests that Tamino is ready to undergo the ordeals that will lead\nto enlightenment. He invokes the gods Isis and Osiris, asking them to protect\nTamino and Pamina (Aria and chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\").\n\n_Scene 2: The courtyard of the Temple of Ordeal_\n\nTamino and Papageno are led in by two priests for the first trial. The two\npriests advise Tamino and Papageno of the dangers ahead of them, warn them of\nwomen's wiles and swear them to silence (Duet: \"Bewahret euch von\nWeibertücken\"). The three ladies appear and try to frighten Tamino and\nPapageno into speaking. (Quintet: \"Wie, wie, wie\") Papageno cannot resist\nanswering the ladies, but Tamino remains aloof, angrily instructing Papageno\nnot to listen to the ladies' threats and to keep quiet. Seeing that Tamino\nwill not speak to them, the ladies withdraw in confusion.\n\n_Scene 3: A garden_\n\nPamina is asleep. Monostatos approaches and gazes upon her with rapture.\n(Aria: \"Alles fühlt der Liebe Freuden\") He is about to kiss the sleeping\nPamina, when the Queen of the Night appears. Monostatos hides. In response to\nthe Queen's questioning, Pamina explains that he is joining Sarastro's\nbrotherhood and she is thinking of accompanying him too. The Queen is not\npleased. She explains that her husband was the previous owner of the temple\nand on his deathbed, he gives the ownership to Sarastro instead of her,\nrendering the Queen powerless (This is in the original libretto, but in modern\nproductions, it is usually omitted, making the scene with Pamina and her\nmother shorter). She gives Pamina a dagger, ordering her to kill Sarastro with\nit and threatening to disown her if she does not. (Aria: \"[Der Hölle Rache\nkocht in meinem Herzen](/wiki/Der_H%C3%B6lle_Rache_kocht_in_meinem_Herzen \"Der\nHölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\")\"). She leaves. Monostatos returns and\ntries to force Pamina's love by threatening to reveal the Queen's plot, but\nSarastro enters and drives him off. Pamina begs Sarastro to forgive her mother\nand he reassures her that revenge and cruelty have no place in his domain\n(Aria: \"In diesen heil'gen Hallen\").\n\n_Scene 4: A hall in the Temple of Ordeal_\n\nTamino and Papageno are led in by priests, who remind them that they must\nremain silent. Papageno complains of thirst. An old woman enters and offers\nPapageno a cup of water. He drinks and teasingly asks whether she has a\nboyfriend. She replies that she does and that his name is Papageno. She\ndisappears as Papageno asks for her name, and the three child-spirits bring in\nfood, the magic flute, and the bells, sent from Sarastro (Trio: \"Seid uns zum\nzweiten Mal willkommen\"). Tamino begins to play the flute, which summons\nPamina. She tries to speak with him, but Tamino, bound by his vow of silence,\ncannot answer her, and Pamina begins to believe that he no longer loves her.\n(Aria: \"Ach, ich fühl's, es ist verschwunden\") She leaves in despair.\n\n_Scene 5: The pyramids_\n\nThe priests celebrate Tamino's successes so far, and pray that he will succeed\nand become worthy of their order (Chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\"). Pamina is\nbrought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell\nbefore the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their\n\"final farewell.\" (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino – \"Soll ich dich, Teurer,\nnicht mehr sehn?\" Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's\nsuicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2,\npreceding or immediately following Sarastro's aria \"O Isis und\nOsiris\".[f][30]) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request\nfor a glass of wine and he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: \"Ein\nMädchen oder Weibchen\"). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless\nhe immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When\nPapageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this\nuntil something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and\npretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him\nback, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.\n\n_Finale. Scene 6: A garden_\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Max_Slevogt_Zauberfl%C3%B6te_Szene.jpg/220px-\nMax_Slevogt_Zauberfl%C3%B6te_Szene.jpg)](/wiki/File:Max_Slevogt_Zauberfl%C3%B6te_Szene.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Max_Slevogt_Zauberfl%C3%B6te_Szene.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTamino and Pamina undergo their final trial; watercolor by [Max\nSlevogt](/wiki/Max_Slevogt \"Max Slevogt\") (1868–1932)\n\nThe three child-spirits hail the dawn. They observe Pamina, who is\ncontemplating suicide because she believes Tamino has abandoned her. The\nchild-spirits restrain her and reassure her of Tamino's love. (Quartet: \"Bald\nprangt, den Morgen zu verkünden\").\n\n_Scene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 7: Outside the Temple\nof Ordeal_\n\nTwo men in armor lead in Tamino. They recite one of the formal creeds of Isis\nand Osiris, promising enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the\nfear of death (\"Der, welcher wandert diese Strasse voll Beschwerden\"). This\nrecitation takes the musical form of a [Baroque](/wiki/Baroque_music \"Baroque\nmusic\") [chorale prelude](/wiki/Chorale_prelude \"Chorale prelude\"), to the\ntune of [Martin Luther](/wiki/Martin_Luther \"Martin Luther\")'s\n[hymn](/wiki/Hymn \"Hymn\") \"[Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh\ndarein](/wiki/Ach_Gott,_vom_Himmel_sieh_darein \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh\ndarein\")\" (Oh God, look down from heaven).[g] Tamino declares that he is ready\nto be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him\nthat the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina\nenters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him.\nShe hands him the magic flute to help them through the trials (\"Tamino mein, o\nwelch ein Glück!\"). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass\nunscathed through chambers of fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their\ntriumph and invite the couple to enter the temple.\n\n_Scene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 8: A garden with a\ntree_\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/15031-Magic_Flute_Production-0413_%2815830972013%29.jpg/220px-15031-Magic_Flute_Production-0413_%2815830972013%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:15031-Magic_Flute_Production-0413_\\(15830972013\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:15031-Magic_Flute_Production-0413_\\(15830972013\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPapageno and Papagena.

She appears and, united, the happy couple\nstutter in astonishment and make bird-like courting sounds at each other. They\nplan their future and dream of the many children they will have together\n(Duet: \"Pa … pa … pa ...\").[h]\n\n_Scene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 9: A rocky landscape\noutside the temple; night_\n\nThe traitorous Monostatos appears with the Queen of the Night and her three\nladies.

The programme at the premiere performance announced it as \"_Eine grosse oper_ \" (A grand opera). Mozart entered the work in his personal catalog as a \"German opera\", and the first printed libretto called it a _Singspiel_.[1]\n  2. **Jump up ^** This is known from testimony by Ignaz von Seyfried (1776–1841), a composer who later (1798) became the musical director at the same theatre. According to Seyfried's memories (which he published in the _[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik](/wiki/Neue_Zeitschrift_f%C3%BCr_Musik \"Neue Zeitschrift für Musik\")_ , vol. 12, 5 June 1840, p. 184), \"[Mozart] personally directed the premiere there on 30 September 1791, at which [Süßmayr](/wiki/Franz_Xaver_S%C3%BCssmayr \"Franz Xaver Süssmayr\"), the faithful [Pylades](/wiki/Pylades \"Pylades\"), sat to his right, diligently turning the pages of the score.\" The description implies that Mozart was seated at a keyboard instrument, playing along with the orchestra, rather than standing on a podium with a baton; this was fairly standard practice for conductors in Mozart's time.[5] Mozart conducted only the first two performances, whereupon direction was taken over by the regular leader of the orchestra, Johann Baptist Henneberg (Abert 2007:1246).\n  3. **Jump up ^** I[mperial] & R[oyal] priv[ileged] Wieden Theatre / Today, Friday 30 September 1791. / The actors of the Imperial and Royal privileged Theatre on the Wieden will have the honour to perform / _For the first time_ : / Die Zauberflöte. / A grand opera in 2 acts, by Emanuel Schikaneder. / _Characters._ / Sarastro. … Hr.
