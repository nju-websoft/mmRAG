The [producer surplus](/wiki/Producer_surplus \"Producer\nsurplus\") always decreases, but the [consumer surplus](/wiki/Consumer_surplus\n\"Consumer surplus\") may or may not increase; however, the decrease in producer\nsurplus must be greater than the increase, if any, in consumer surplus.\n\nA **deadweight loss** , also known as **excess burden** or **allocative\ninefficiency** , is a loss of [economic efficiency](/wiki/Economic_efficiency\n\"Economic efficiency\") that can occur when equilibrium for a\n[good](/wiki/Good_\\(economics\\) \"Good \\(economics\\)\") or a service is not\nachieved. That can be caused by [monopoly](/wiki/Monopoly \"Monopoly\") pricing\nin the case of [artificial scarcity](/wiki/Artificial_scarcity \"Artificial\nscarcity\"), an [externality](/wiki/Externality \"Externality\"), a [tax or\nsubsidy](/wiki/Effect_of_taxes_and_subsidies_on_price \"Effect of taxes and\nsubsidies on price\"), or a binding [price ceiling](/wiki/Price_ceiling \"Price\nceiling\") or [price floor](/wiki/Price_floor \"Price floor\") such as a [minimum\nwage](/wiki/Minimum_wage \"Minimum wage\").\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Examples\n  * 2 Harberger's triangle\n  * 3 Hicks vs. Marshall\n  * 4 Deadweight loss of Taxation\n    * 4.1 The Determinants of Deadweight losses\n    * 4.2 How Deadweight loss changes as taxes vary\n    * 4.3 Deadweight loss of a monopoly\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 Further reading\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Examples[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Deadweight_loss&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Examples\")]\n\nAn example is a market for nails where the cost of each nail is $0.10 and the\ndemand decreases linearly, from a high demand for free nails to zero demand\nfor nails at $1.10. If the market has [perfect\ncompetition](/wiki/Perfect_competition \"Perfect competition\"), producers would\nhave to charge a price of $0.10, and every customer whose marginal benefit\nexceeds $0.10 would have a nail. However, if there is one producer with a\nmonopoly on the product, it will charge whatever price will yield the greatest\nprofit. The producer would then charge $0.60 and thus exclude every customer\nwho had less than $0.60 of marginal benefit. The deadweight loss would then be\nthe economic benefit foregone by such customers because of monopoly pricing.\n\nConversely, deadweight loss can come from consumers if they buy a product even\nif it costs more than it benefits them. To describe this, if the same nail\nmarket had the government giving a $0.03 subsidy to every nail produced, the\nsubsidy would push the market price of each nail down to $0.07. Some consumers\nwould then buy nails even though the benefit to them is less than the real\ncost of $0.10. That unneeded expense would then create a deadweight loss, with\nresources not being used efficiently.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/TaxWithTax.svg/250px-\nTaxWithTax.svg.png)](/wiki/File:TaxWithTax.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:TaxWithTax.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe deadweight loss is the area of the triangle formed by the grey tax income\nbox (to the right of it), the original supply curve, and the demand curve. It\nis sometimes called Harberger's triangle.\n\nIf the price of a glass of wine is $3.00 and the price of a glass of beer is\n$3.00, a consumer might prefer to drink wine. If the government decides to\nlevy a wine tax of $3.00 per glass, the consumer might prefer to drink beer.\nThe [excess burden of taxation](/wiki/Excess_burden_of_taxation \"Excess burden\nof taxation\") is the loss of utility to the consumer for drinking beer instead\nof wine since everything else remains unchanged.\n\n## Harberger's\ntriangle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Deadweight_loss&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Harberger's triangle\")]\n\nHarberger's triangle, generally attributed to [Arnold\nHarberger](/wiki/Arnold_Harberger \"Arnold Harberger\"), refers to the\ndeadweight loss (as measured on a supply and demand graph) associated with\ngovernment intervention in a perfect market. That can happen through [price\nfloors](/wiki/Price_floor \"Price floor\"), [caps](/wiki/Price_ceiling \"Price\nceiling\"), taxes, tariffs, or quotas. It also refers to the deadweight loss\ncreated by a government's failure to intervene in a market with\n[externalities](/wiki/Externality \"Externality\").[1] In the case of a\ngovernment tax, the amount of the tax drives a [wedge](/wiki/Tax_wedge \"Tax\nwedge\") between what consumers pay and what producers receive, and the filled-\nin wedge shape is equivalent to the deadweight loss from the tax.[2]\n\nThe area represented by the triangle comes from the fact that the intersection\nof the supply and the demand curves are cut short so the consumer surplus and\nthe producer surplus are also cut short. The loss of such surplus that is not\nrecouped, is the deadweight loss.\n\nSome economists like [James Tobin](/wiki/James_Tobin \"James Tobin\") have\nargued that the triangles do not have a huge impact on the economy, but others\nlike [Martin Feldstein](/wiki/Martin_Feldstein \"Martin Feldstein\") maintain\nthat they can seriously affect long-term economic trends by pivoting the trend\ndownwards and cause a magnification of losses in the long run.\n\n## Hicks vs.\nMarshall[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Deadweight_loss&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Hicks vs. Marshall\")]\n\nAn important distinction should be made between\n[Hicksian](/wiki/Hicksian_demand_function \"Hicksian demand function\") (per\n[John Hicks](/wiki/John_Hicks \"John Hicks\")) and\n[Marshallian](/wiki/Marshallian_demand_function \"Marshallian demand function\")\n(per [Alfred Marshall](/wiki/Alfred_Marshall \"Alfred Marshall\")) deadweight\nloss. After the [consumer surplus](/wiki/Consumer_surplus \"Consumer surplus\")\nis considered, it can be shown that the Marshallian deadweight loss is zero if\ndemand is perfectly [elastic](/wiki/Elasticity_\\(economics\\) \"Elasticity\n\\(economics\\)\") or supply is perfectly inelastic. However, Hicks analyzed the\nsituation through [indifference curves](/wiki/Indifference_curves\n\"Indifference curves\") and noted that when the Marshallian demand curve is\nperfectly inelastic, the policy or economic situation that caused a distortion\nin [relative prices](/wiki/Relative_price \"Relative price\") has a substitution\neffect, i.e. is a deadweight loss.\n\nIn modern economic literature, the most common measure of a taxpayer’s loss\nfrom a distortionary tax, such as a tax on bicycles, is the equivalent\nvariation, the maximum amount that a taxpayer would be willing to forgo in a\nlump sum to avoid the distortionary tax. The deadweight loss can then be\ninterpreted as the difference between the equivalent variation and the revenue\nraised by the tax. The difference is attributable to the behavioural changes\ninduced by a distortionary tax that are measured by a substitution effect.\nHowever, that is not the only interpretation, and Lind and Granqvist (2010)\npoint out that Pigou did not use a lump sum tax as the point of reference to\ndiscuss deadweight loss (excess burden).\n\n## Deadweight loss of\nTaxation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Deadweight_loss&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Deadweight loss of Taxation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Tax_deadweight.gif/324px-\nTax_deadweight.gif)](/wiki/File:Tax_deadweight.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tax_deadweight.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Deadweight loss of taxation;the tax increases the price paid by buyers to\n_Pc_ and decreases price received by sellers to _Pp and_ the quantity sold\nreduces from Qe to Qt.\n\nWhen a tax is levied on buyers, the demand curve shifts downward by the size\nof the tax. Similarly, when tax is levied on sellers, the supply curve shifts\nupward by the size of tax. When the tax is imposed, the price paid by buyers\nincreases, and the price received by seller decreases. Therefore, buyers and\nsellers share the burden of the tax, regardless of how it is imposed. Since\ntax situates a wedge between the price buyers pay and the price sellers get,\nthe quantity sold goes down below the level that it would be without tax. To\nput it another way, a tax on good leads the size of market for the good to\ndecrease. The reason is why tax creates deadweight losses can be explained\nwith one example. Suppose that Will is a cleaner who is working in the\ncleaning service company and Amie hired Will to clean her room every week for\n$100. The opportunity cost of Will’s time is $80, while the value of a clean\nhouse to Amie is $120. Hence, each of them get same amount of benefit from\ntheir deal.Amie and Will get 20$ making the total surplus $40 from trade.\nHowever, when the government decides to imposed $50 a tax upon the providers\nof cleaning services. There would be no beneficial trade between them. Because\nAmie would not willing to pay any price above $120, while Will would not\ndesire get his opportunity cost below the level that they have made a deal.\nBecause of these reasons, not only Amie and Will give up the deal, but also\nAmie has to live dirtier house, and Will does not get his income. Thereby,\nthey have lost amount of surplus that they have gotten from their deal, and at\nthe same time, this made each of them worse off up to $40. When it comes to\ngovernment revenue from this tax, since Amie and Will have given up the deal,\nthe government also can not get any revenue from them. So this $40 is referred\ndeadweight loss; it causes losses both for buyers and sellers in a market and\ngovernment revenues. _Taxes cause deadweight losses because they prevent\nbuyers and sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade._[3]\n\nIn the graph, the deadweight loss can be seen at the area between the supply\nand demand curves. While the demand curve shows the value of goods to the\nconsumers, the cost of the producers is reflected by supply curve. As the\nexample above explains it, when the government imposes a tax upon taxpayers,\nthe tax increases the price paid by buyers to _Pc_ and decreases price\nreceived by sellers to _Pp_ , buyers and sellers (Amie and Will) give up the\ndeal between them and they leave the market. Thus, the quantity sold reduces\nfrom Qe to Qt. Mainly, the deadweight loss occurs because the tax deters these\nkinds of beneficial trades in the market.[3]\n\n### The Determinants of Deadweight\nlosses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Deadweight_loss&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: The Determinants of Deadweight losses\")]\n\nPrice elasticities of supply and demand determines whether the deadweight loss\nfrom tax is a large or small. This basically measures how much quantity\nsupplied and quantity demanded respond to changes in the price. For instance,\nwhen the supply curve is relatively inelastic, quantity supplied responds\nslightly to changes in the price. However, when the supply curve is more\nelastic, quantity supplied responds significantly to changes in the price. In\nother words, when the supply curve is more elastic, the area between the\nsupply and demand curves is larger. Similarly, when the demand curve is\nrelatively inelastic, deadweight loss from the tax is smaller, comparing to\nmore elastic demand curve.\n\nThe reason is that tax has a deadweight loss, because it causes buyers and\nsellers to change their behaviour. Buyers tend to consume less, when the tax\nraises the price paid by buyers. Also, when the tax lowers the price received\nby sellers, they produce less. Due to these reasons, the size of market\ndecreases below the optimum. The elasticities of supply and demand designate\nto what extent the tax distorts the market outcome. Thereby, as the\nelasticities of supply and demand increase, it causes more the deadweight loss\nof a tax.[3]\n\n### How Deadweight loss changes as taxes\nvary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Deadweight_loss&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: How Deadweight loss changes as taxes vary\")]\n\nTaxes have a potential to be changed over time by the government or\npolicymakers at the different level of the state. For instance, when the small\ntax is levied, the deadweight loss is substantially small if we compare to\nmedium or large tax. The deadweight loss of a tax increases more quickly than\nthe size of the tax. Because an area of the triangle of deadweight loss based\non the square of its dimension. When the size of tax is doubled, the bottom\nand height of the triangle double. Thus, deadweight loss increases by the\nnumber of 4. While deadweight loss occur as taxes vary, at the same time, this\naffects the government’s tax revenue. Tax revenue is shown as the area of the\nrectangle between supply and demand curve. When small tax is levied, tax\nrevenue is relatively small. As the size of tax increases, tax revenue\nexpands. But when the much larger tax is levied, tax revenue decreases because\nthe larger tax lowers the size of the market. The main reason is that people\nwould most likely stop buying and selling good in the market.[3]\n\n### Deadweight loss of a\nmonopoly[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Deadweight_loss&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Deadweight loss of a monopoly\")]\n\nThe deadweight loss occurs in monopolies in the same way that the tax causes\ndeadweight loss.When a monopoly, as a tax collector, charges a price in order\nto consolidate its power above marginal cost.it situates a wedge.As imposing a\ntax distorts market outcome, the wedge leads to quantity sold to go down below\nthe social optimum. However, there is only a difference between two cases;\nwhile private company receives the monopoly profit, the government obtains the\nrevenue from a tax.[3]\n\nSee also\n\n  * [Excess burden of taxation](/wiki/Excess_burden_of_taxation \"Excess burden of taxation\")\n  * [Optimal tax](/wiki/Optimal_tax \"Optimal tax\")\n  * [Pareto efficiency](/wiki/Pareto_efficiency \"Pareto efficiency\")\n  * [Tax choice](/wiki/Tax_choice \"Tax choice\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Deadweight_loss&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Negative Externality\"](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).
