Otherwise known as \"Pete, the Dog With the Ring\nAround His Eye\", or simply \"Petey\", he was well known for having a circled eye\nthat was added on by [Hollywood](/wiki/Hollywood \"Hollywood\") make-up artist\n[Max Factor](/wiki/Max_Factor,_Sr. \"Max Factor, Sr.\")[1] and credited as an\noddity in _[Ripley's Believe It or Not](/wiki/Ripley%27s_Believe_It_or_Not\n\"Ripley's Believe It or Not\")_. The original Pete (sired by \"Tudor's Black\nJack\") was an [APBT](/wiki/American_Pit_Bull_Terrier \"American Pit Bull\nTerrier\") named \"Pal, the Wonder Dog\", and had a natural ring almost\ncompletely around his right eye; dye was used to finish it off.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Death\n  * 3 External links\n  * 4 References\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pete_the_Pup&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Our_Gang_with_Director_Robert_McGowan.jpg/260px-\nOur_Gang_with_Director_Robert_McGowan.jpg)](/wiki/File:Our_Gang_with_Director_Robert_McGowan.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Our_Gang_with_Director_Robert_McGowan.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPal the Wonder Dog as Pete, along with _Our Gang_ cast with Director Robert\nMcGowan.\n\nWhen he was about six months old, Pal the Wonder Dog made a cameo appearance\nin the [Harold Lloyd](/wiki/Harold_Lloyd \"Harold Lloyd\") film _[The\nFreshman](/wiki/The_Freshman_\\(1925_film\\) \"The Freshman \\(1925 film\\)\")_ , in\n1925.[2]\n\nPal first started out as \"Tige\" in the _[Buster Brown](/wiki/Buster_Brown\n\"Buster Brown\")_ series in the 1920s. It was during this time that he acquired\nthe circled eye, and when he was recruited to appear in the _Our Gang_\ncomedies later that year, [Hal Roach](/wiki/Hal_Roach \"Hal Roach\") simply left\nit on, creating one of the most recognized dogs in film history.\n\nTrainer and owner Lt. Harry Lucenay used one of Pal's offspring as Pete in the\nseries after Pal was poisoned and died in 1930.[3] The dog, named Lucenay's\nPeter, was bred by A. A. Keller. The second Pete looked very similar to the\nfirst Pete but was a mirror image. The circle was on the right eye on the\nfirst Pete while it was on the left eye on the second Pete. The second Pete\nappeared as a puppy on _[Pups Is Pups](/wiki/Pups_Is_Pups \"Pups Is Pups\")_ and\nwas nearly full-grown on his second appearance, _[School's\nOut](/wiki/School%27s_Out_\\(1930_film\\) \"School's Out \\(1930 film\\)\")_. The\nsecond Pete's last _Our Gang_ appearance was _[The Pooch](/wiki/The_Pooch \"The\nPooch\")_ in 1932 when, in the plot, a [dog catcher](/wiki/Dog_catcher \"Dog\ncatcher\") attempts to kill Pete in a gas chamber but is unsuccessful. So\nLucenay's Peter was the best known. After Lucenay was fired from the _Our\nGang_ series in 1932, he retired Peter to [Atlantic City](/wiki/Atlantic_City\n\"Atlantic City\"), where he was photographed with children at the [Steel\nPier](/wiki/Steel_Pier \"Steel Pier\"). Beginning with _[Hook and\nLadder](/wiki/Hook_and_Ladder_\\(1932_film\\) \"Hook and Ladder \\(1932 film\\)\")_\nlater in 1932, an unrelated dog played Pete and until 1938 a few unrelated\ndogs would play the role, though in less prominent roles than in the early\n1930s.\n\nIn the [1982 cartoon series](/wiki/The_Little_Rascals_\\(animated_TV_series\\)\n\"The Little Rascals \\(animated TV series\\)\") produced by [Hanna-\nBarbera](/wiki/Hanna-Barbera_Productions \"Hanna-Barbera Productions\"), he was\nvoiced by [Peter Cullen](/wiki/Peter_Cullen \"Peter Cullen\"). In the 1994\nfeature film remake of _[The Little Rascals](/wiki/The_Little_Rascals_\\(film\\)\n\"The Little Rascals \\(film\\)\")_ , Pete is an American Bulldog, and in the 2014\nmovie _[The Little Rascals Save the Day](/wiki/The_Little_Rascals_Save_the_Day\n\"The Little Rascals Save the Day\")_ , Pete is a mongrel dog.\n\nA parody of Pete appeared breifly in the Bob Hope short [Watch the\nBirdie](/w/index.php?title=Watch_the_Birdie_\\(1935_film\\)&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Watch the Birdie \\(1935 film\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\"), produced by\ncompetitor, [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\")\n\n## Death[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pete_the_Pup&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Death\")]\n\nRoach used a number of unrelated dogs to portray Pete in _Our Gang_ until\n1938.[3] Lucenay's Peter continued on and died of old age on January 28, 1946,\nin [Los Angeles, California](/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California \"Los Angeles,\nCalifornia\"), at age 16 years/4 months, two years after the _Our Gang_ series\nended. Pete is buried at [Los Angeles Pet Memorial\nPark](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Pet_Memorial_Park \"Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park\") at\n[Calabasas](/wiki/Calabasas \"Calabasas\"), [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los\nAngeles\") County, California, United States.\n\n## External links[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pete_the_Pup&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: External links\")]\n\n  * [Pal the Dog](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1261962/) on [IMDb](/wiki/IMDb \"IMDb\")\n  * [Pete the Pup](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1295974/) on [IMDb](/wiki/IMDb \"IMDb\")\n  * [Pal the Dog](https://www.allmovie.com/artist/p54744) at [AllMovie](/wiki/AllMovie \"AllMovie\")\n  * [Pete the Pup](https://www.allmovie.com/artist/p56250) at [AllMovie](/wiki/AllMovie \"AllMovie\")\n  * [Pal The Wonder Dog And Pete](http://americacomesalive.com/2011/08/01/pal-the-wonder-dog-and-his-offspring-pete/)\n  * [Pal the wonder dog - online pedigree](http://www.fiapbtpedigree.com/imprimir_ficha.php?criterio=326891)\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pete_the_Pup&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Martin, Rick (2007). _Circus Tricks for Your Dog: 25 Crowd-Pleasers That Will Make Your Dog a Star_.
