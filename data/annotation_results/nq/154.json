[Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft\n\"Microsoft\"). As the successor to the [original Xbox](/wiki/Xbox_\\(console\\)\n\"Xbox \\(console\\)\"), it is the second console in the [Xbox](/wiki/Xbox \"Xbox\")\nseries. It competed with [Sony](/wiki/Sony \"Sony\")'s [PlayStation\n3](/wiki/PlayStation_3 \"PlayStation 3\") and [Nintendo](/wiki/Nintendo\n\"Nintendo\")'s [Wii](/wiki/Wii \"Wii\") as part of the [seventh generation of\nvideo game consoles](/wiki/Seventh_generation_of_video_game_consoles \"Seventh\ngeneration of video game consoles\"). It was officially unveiled on\n[MTV](/wiki/MTV \"MTV\") on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game\ninformation announced later that month at the 2005\n[E3](/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo \"Electronic Entertainment Expo\")\nexpo.\n\nThe Xbox 360 features an online service, [Xbox Live](/wiki/Xbox_Live \"Xbox\nLive\"), which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox\nand received regular updates during the console's lifetime. Available in free\nand subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: [play games\nonline](/wiki/Online_game \"Online game\"); download games (through [Xbox Live\nArcade](/wiki/Xbox_Live_Arcade \"Xbox Live Arcade\")) and game demos; purchase\nand [stream](/wiki/Streaming_media \"Streaming media\") music, television\nprograms, and films through the [Xbox Music](/wiki/Xbox_Music \"Xbox Music\")\nand [Xbox Video](/wiki/Xbox_Video \"Xbox Video\") portals; and access third-\nparty content services through media streaming applications. In addition to\nonline multimedia features, it allows users to stream media from local PCs.\nSeveral peripherals have been released, including wireless\n[controllers](/wiki/Xbox_360_controller \"Xbox 360 controller\"), expanded [hard\ndrive](/wiki/Hard_disk_drive \"Hard disk drive\") storage, and the\n[Kinect](/wiki/Kinect \"Kinect\") [motion sensing](/wiki/Motion_sensing \"Motion\nsensing\") camera. The release of these additional services and peripherals\nhelped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia,\nturning it into a hub for living-room computing\nentertainment.[16][17][18][19][20]\n\n[Launched](/wiki/Xbox_360_launch \"Xbox 360 launch\") worldwide across\n2005–2006, the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions,\nincluding North America and Europe. The earliest versions of the console\nsuffered from a high [failure rate](/wiki/Failure_rate \"Failure rate\"),\nindicated by the so-called \"[Red Ring of\nDeath](/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems \"Xbox 360 technical problems\")\",\nnecessitating an extension of the device's warranty period. Microsoft released\ntwo redesigned models of the console: the _Xbox 360 S_ in 2010,[21] and the\n_Xbox 360 E_ in 2013.[22] As of June 2014, 84 million Xbox 360 consoles have\nbeen sold worldwide, making it the [sixth-highest-selling video game console\nin history](/wiki/List_of_million-selling_game_consoles \"List of million-\nselling game consoles\"), and the highest-selling console made by an American\ncompany. Although not the best-selling console of its generation, the Xbox 360\nwas deemed by [TechRadar](/wiki/TechRadar \"TechRadar\") to be the most\ninfluential through its emphasis on digital media distribution and multiplayer\ngaming on Xbox Live.[20][23]\n\nThe Xbox 360's successor, the [Xbox One](/wiki/Xbox_One \"Xbox One\"), was\nreleased on November 22, 2013.[24] On April 20, 2016, Microsoft announced that\nit would end the production of new Xbox 360 hardware, although the company\nwill continue to support the platform.[6]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Development\n    * 1.2 Launch\n    * 1.3 Critical reception\n    * 1.4 Sales\n    * 1.5 Legacy\n  * 2 Hardware\n    * 2.1 Technical specifications\n    * 2.2 Accessories\n      * 2.2.1 Kinect\n    * 2.3 AV output\n    * 2.4 Retail configurations\n      * 2.4.1 Timeline\n      * 2.4.2 United States\n    * 2.5 Technical problems\n  * 3 Software\n    * 3.1 Games\n    * 3.2 Interface\n      * 3.2.1 New Xbox Experience\n    * 3.3 Multimedia\n    * 3.4 XNA community\n  * 4 Services\n    * 4.1 Xbox Live\n    * 4.2 Xbox Live Marketplace\n    * 4.3 Xbox Live Arcade\n    * 4.4 Movies & TV\n    * 4.5 Groove Music\n    * 4.6 Xbox SmartGlass\n  * 5 Game development\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## History\n\n### Development\n\nKnown during development as Xbox Next, Xenon, Xbox 2, Xbox FS or NextBox,[25]\nthe Xbox 360 was conceived in early 2003.[26] In February 2003, planning for\nthe Xenon [software platform](/wiki/Computing_platform \"Computing platform\")\nbegan, and was headed by Microsoft's Vice President [J Allard](/wiki/J_Allard\n\"J Allard\").[26] That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in\n[Bellevue, Washington](/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington \"Bellevue, Washington\") to\nrecruit support for the system.[26] Also that month, [Peter\nMoore](/wiki/Peter_Moore_\\(business\\) \"Peter Moore \\(business\\)\"), former\npresident of [Sega](/wiki/Sega \"Sega\") of America, joined Microsoft. On August\n12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new\nconsole, a deal which was publicly announced two days later.[27] Before the\nlaunch of the Xbox 360, several [Alpha](/wiki/Alpha_test \"Alpha test\")\ndevelopment kits were spotted using [Apple's](/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\")\n[Power Mac G5](/wiki/Power_Mac_G5 \"Power Mac G5\") hardware. This was because\nthe system's [PowerPC 970](/wiki/PowerPC_970 \"PowerPC 970\") processor running\nthe same [PowerPC](/wiki/PowerPC \"PowerPC\") architecture that the Xbox 360\nwould eventually run under [IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\")'s\n[Xenon](/wiki/Xenon_\\(processor\\) \"Xenon \\(processor\\)\") processor. The cores\nof the Xenon [processor](/wiki/Central_processing_unit \"Central processing\nunit\") were developed using a slightly modified version of the [PlayStation\n3](/wiki/PlayStation_3 \"PlayStation 3\")'s [Cell\nProcessor](/wiki/Cell_\\(microprocessor\\) \"Cell \\(microprocessor\\)\") PPE\narchitecture. According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps, the [IBM](/wiki/IBM\n\"IBM\") employees were \"hiding\" their work from Sony and Toshiba, IBM's\npartners in developing the [Cell Processor](/wiki/Cell_\\(microprocessor\\)\n\"Cell \\(microprocessor\\)\").[28] [Jeff Minter](/wiki/Jeff_Minter \"Jeff Minter\")\ncreated the [music visualization](/wiki/Music_visualization \"Music\nvisualization\") program [Neon](/wiki/Neon_\\(light_synthesizer\\) \"Neon \\(light\nsynthesizer\\)\") which is included with the Xbox 360.[29]\n\n### Launch\n\nMain article: [Xbox 360 launch](/wiki/Xbox_360_launch \"Xbox 360 launch\")\n\nThe Xbox 360 was released on November 22, 2005, in the United States and\nCanada;[5] December 2, 2005, in Europe and December 10, 2005, in Japan. It was\nlater launched in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong, Singapore, South\nKorea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and Russia. In its\nfirst year on the market, the system launched in 36 countries, more countries\nthan any other console has launched in a single year.[30]\n\n### Critical reception\n\nIn 2009, [IGN](/wiki/IGN \"IGN\") named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video\ngame console of all time, out of a field of 25.[31] Although not the best-\nselling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by\n[TechRadar](/wiki/TechRadar \"TechRadar\") to be the most influential, by\nemphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live,\nand by popularizing [game achievement\nawards](/wiki/Achievement_\\(video_gaming\\) \"Achievement \\(video\ngaming\\)\").[20] _PC Magazine_ considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online\ngaming as it \"proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the\nconsole space\".[16] Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-\nreceived [Kinect](/wiki/Kinect \"Kinect\") motion capture camera was released,\nwhich set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device\nin history, and extended the life of the console.[32]\n_[Edge](/wiki/Edge_\\(magazine\\) \"Edge \\(magazine\\)\")_ ranked Xbox 360 the\nsecond-best console of the 1993–2013 period, stating \"It had its own social\nnetwork, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of\njust about every multiformat game..._[Killzone](/wiki/Killzone_\\(series\\)\n\"Killzone \\(series\\)\")_ is no _[Halo](/wiki/Halo_\\(series\\) \"Halo\n\\(series\\)\")_ and nowadays _[Gran Turismo](/wiki/Gran_Turismo_\\(series\\) \"Gran\nTurismo \\(series\\)\")_ is no _[Forza](/wiki/Forza_Motorsport_\\(series\\) \"Forza\nMotorsport \\(series\\)\")_ , but it's not about the exclusives—there's nothing\nto trump [Naughty Dog](/wiki/Naughty_Dog \"Naughty Dog\")'s PS3 output, after\nall. Rather, it's about the choices Microsoft made back in the original Xbox's\nlifetime. The PC-like architecture meant the early EA Sports games ran at\n60fps compared to only 30 on PS3, Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had\nan existing friends list, and _Halo_ meant Microsoft had the killer next-\ngeneration exclusive. And when developers demo games on PC now they do it with\na 360 pad—another industry benchmark, and a critical one.\"[33]\n\n### Sales\n\nRegion | [Units

in\nJapan.[46]\n\nIn May 2008 Microsoft announced that 10 million Xbox 360s had been sold and\nthat it was the \"first current generation gaming console\" to surpass the 10\nmillion figure in the US.[47] In the US, the Xbox 360 was the leader in\ncurrent-generation home console sales until June 2008, when it was surpassed\nby the Wii.[48][49][50] The Xbox 360 has sold a total of 870,000 units in\nCanada as of August 1, 2008.[51] Between January 2011 and October 2013, the\nXbox 360 was the best-selling console in the United States for these 32\nconsecutive months.[52]\n\nIn Europe, the Xbox 360 has sold seven million units as of November 20, 2008,\naccording to Microsoft.[53] In the United Kingdom, the Xbox 360 has sold 3.9\nmillion units as of June 27, 2009, according to [GfK](/wiki/GfK \"GfK\") [Chart-\nTrack](/wiki/Chart-Track \"Chart-Track\").[35]\n\nWhile the original [Xbox](/wiki/Xbox_\\(console\\) \"Xbox \\(console\\)\") sold\npoorly in Japan, selling just 450,000 by November 2011[54], the Xbox 360 sold\nalmost as poorly, selling only 1.5 million units from 2005 to 2011.[36]\n_[Edge](/wiki/Edge_\\(magazine\\) \"Edge \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine reported in\nAugust 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan,\nwhere Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of\ndomestic rivals Sony and Nintendo, had led to retailers scaling down and in\nsome cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely.[55] The\nsignificance of Japan's poor sales might be overstated in the media in\ncomparison to overall international sales.[56]\n\n### Legacy\n\nThe Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-\nselling console of the seventh generation, it is regarded as a success since\nit strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the\nexpense of well-established rivals.[23] The inexpensive [Nintendo\nWii](/wiki/Nintendo_Wii \"Nintendo Wii\") did sell the most console units but\neventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years,\nand it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding [Wii\nU](/wiki/Wii_U \"Wii U\") had a poor debut in 2012.[20][57][58][59][60][61] The\n[PlayStation 3](/wiki/PlayStation_3 \"PlayStation 3\") struggled for a time due\nto being too expensive and initially lacking quality games,[62] making it far\nless dominant than its predecessor, the [PlayStation 2](/wiki/PlayStation_2\n\"PlayStation 2\"), and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for\nits sales and games to reach parity with the Xbox 360. _TechRadar_ proclaimed\nthat \"Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill – a position that puts\nall the more pressure on its successor, Xbox One\".[20]\n\nThe Xbox 360's advantage over its competitors was due to the release of high-\nprofile games from both first party and third party developers. The 2007 [Game\nCritics Awards](/wiki/Game_Critics_Awards \"Game Critics Awards\") honored the\nplatform with 38 nominations and 12 wins – more than any other\nplatform.[63][64] By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software [attach\nrate](/wiki/Attach_rate \"Attach rate\") of 7.5 games per console in the US; the\nrate was 7.0 in Europe, while its competitors were 3.8 (PS3) and 3.5 (Wii),\naccording to Microsoft.[65] At the 2008 [Game Developers\nConference](/wiki/Game_Developers_Conference \"Game Developers Conference\"),\nMicrosoft announced that it expected over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360\nby the end of the year.[66] As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions\nto the Halo franchise and _[Gears of War](/wiki/Gears_of_War \"Gears of War\")_\n, the Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of games that were\ninitially planned to be PS3 exclusives, including _[Devil May Cry\n4](/wiki/Devil_May_Cry_4 \"Devil May Cry 4\")_ ,[67] _[Ace Combat\n6](/wiki/Ace_Combat_6 \"Ace Combat 6\")_ ,[68] _[Virtua Fighter\n5](/wiki/Virtua_Fighter_5 \"Virtua Fighter 5\")_ ,[69] _[Grand Theft Auto\nIV](/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV \"Grand Theft Auto IV\")_ ,[70] _[Final Fantasy\nXIII](/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIII \"Final Fantasy XIII\")_ ,[71] _[Tekken\n6](/wiki/Tekken_6 \"Tekken 6\")_ ,[72] _[Metal Gear Solid :\nRising](/wiki/Metal_Gear_Rising:_Revengeance \"Metal Gear Rising:\nRevengeance\")_ ,[73] and _[L.A. Noire](/wiki/L.A._Noire \"L.A. Noire\")_.[74] In\naddition, Xbox 360 versions of cross-platform games were generally considered\nsuperior to their PS3 counterparts in 2006 and 2007, due in part to the\ndifficulties of programming for the PS3.[75]\n\n[TechRadar](/wiki/TechRadar \"TechRadar\") deemed the Xbox 360 as the most\ninfluential game system through its emphasis of digital media distribution,\nXbox Live online gaming service, and [game\nachievement](/wiki/Achievement_\\(video_gaming\\) \"Achievement \\(video\ngaming\\)\") feature.[20] During the console's lifetime, the Xbox brand has\ngrown from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub\nfor \"living-room computing environment\".[17][18][19] Five years after the Xbox\n360's original debut, the well-received [Kinect](/wiki/Kinect \"Kinect\") motion\ncapture camera was released, which became the fastest selling consumer\nelectronic device in history, and extended the life of the console.[32]\n\nMicrosoft announced the [Xbox One](/wiki/Xbox_One \"Xbox One\"), successor to\nthe Xbox 360, at [E3](/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo \"Electronic\nEntertainment Expo\") on June 10, 2013. Although succeeded as Microsoft's main\nconsole by the Xbox One, support from publishers for the Xbox 360 is expected\nto continue until at least 2016.[76] On April 20, 2016, Microsoft announced\nthe end of production of new Xbox 360 hardware; the company will continue to\nprovide hardware and software support for the platform, as selected Xbox 360\ngames can be played on Xbox One.[77]\n\n## Hardware\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Microsoft-\nXbox-360-E-wController.jpg/220px-Microsoft-\nXbox-360-E-wController.jpg)](/wiki/File:Microsoft-Xbox-360-E-wController.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Microsoft-Xbox-360-E-wController.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Xbox 360 E model, announced at 2013's\n[E3](/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo \"Electronic Entertainment Expo\"),\nshares many aesthetics with the [Xbox One](/wiki/Xbox_One \"Xbox One\").\n\nThe main unit of the Xbox 360 itself has slight double concavity in matte\nwhite or black.

The original shipment of the Xbox 360 version\nincluded a cut-down version of the Media Remote as a promotion. The Elite\npackage was launched later at US$479. The \"Xbox 360 Core\" was replaced by the\n\"Xbox 360 Arcade\" in October 2007[92] and a 60 GB version of the Xbox 360 Pro\nwas released on August 1, 2008.

The S model carries a smaller,\nstreamlined appearance with an angular case, and utilizes a redesigned\nmotherboard designed to alleviate the hardware and overheating issues\nexperienced by prior models. It also includes a proprietary port for use with\nthe Kinect sensor.[21][94][95] The Xbox 360 E, a further streamlined variation\nof the 360 S with a two-tone rectangular case inspired by [Xbox\nOne](/wiki/Xbox_One \"Xbox One\"), was released in 2013. In addition to its\nrevised aesthetics, the Xbox 360 E also has one fewer USB port, no AV\nconnector (and thus is HDMI-only), and no longer supports\n[S/PDIF](/wiki/S/PDIF \"S/PDIF\").[96]\n\n#### Timeline\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/dcf6447a398e1dc4ce0d9a8538cd3a83.png)\n\n#### United States\n\n**November 22, 2005**\n\n  * Launch of Xbox 360 Premium (20 GB) – $399.99\n  * Launch of Xbox 360 Core – $299.99\n\n**April 29, 2007**\n\n  * Launch Xbox 360 Elite (120 GB) – $479.99[97]\n\n**August 6, 2007**[98]\n\n  * Price cut on Xbox 360 Premium (20 GB) – $349.99\n  * Price cut on Xbox 360 Core – $279.99\n  * Price cut on Xbox 360 Elite – $449.99\n\n**October 27, 2007**\n\n  * Launch of Xbox 360 Arcade – $279.99[99]\n  * Discontinuation of Xbox 360 Core\n\n|  **July 13, 2008**\n\n  * Discontinuation of Xbox 360 (20 GB) (price cut to $299.99 for remaining stock)[100]\n\n**August 1, 2008**[100]\n\n  * Launch of Xbox 360 Premium (60 GB) – $349.99\n\n**September 5, 2008**[101]\n\n  * Price cut on Xbox 360 Elite – $399.99\n  * Price cut on Xbox 360 (60 GB) – $299.99\n  * Price cut on Xbox 360 Arcade – $199.99\n\n**August 28, 2009**\n\n  * Discontinuation of Xbox 360 (60 GB) (price cut to $249.99 for remaining stock)\n  * Price cut on Xbox 360 Elite – $299.99\n\n|  **June 19, 2010**[21]\n\n  * Launch of Xbox 360 S 250 GB – $299.99\n  * Discontinuation of Xbox 360 Elite (price cut to $249.99 for remaining stock)\n  * Discontinuation of Xbox 360 Arcade (price cut to $149.99 for remaining stock)\n\n**August 3, 2010**\n\n  * Launch of Xbox 360 S 4 GB – $199.99\n\n**June 10, 2013**\n\n  * Launch of Xbox 360 E 4 GB – $199.99[101]\n  * Launch of Xbox 360 E 250 GB – $299.99\n\n**April 20, 2016**\n\n  * Discontinuation of all Xbox 360 models.[6]\n\n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n### Technical problems\n\nMain article: [Xbox 360 technical problems](/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems\n\"Xbox 360 technical problems\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Xbox360-ringofdeath.jpg/220px-\nXbox360-ringofdeath.jpg)](/wiki/File:Xbox360-ringofdeath.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Xbox360-ringofdeath.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThree red lights on the Xbox 360's ring indicator representing a \"General\nError requiring service of the Console or Power Adapter,\" commonly nicknamed\nthe \"Red Ring of Death.\"\n\nThe Xbox 360 (not Slim and E models) has been subject to a number of technical\nproblems. Since the console's release in 2005, users have reported concerns\nover its reliability and [failure rate](/wiki/Failure_rate \"Failure\nrate\").[102][103][104]\n\nTo aid customers with defective consoles, Microsoft extended the Xbox 360's\nmanufacturer's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that\ngenerate a \"General Hardware Failure\" error report. A \"General Hardware\nFailure\" is recognized on all models released before the Xbox 360 S by three\nquadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red. This error is\noften known as the \"[Red Ring of Death](/wiki/Red_Ring_of_Death \"Red Ring of\nDeath\")\".[105] In April 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures\nrelated to the E74 [error code](/wiki/Error_code \"Error code\").[106] The\nwarranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not\ngenerate these specific error codes.\n\nSince these problems surfaced, Microsoft has attempted to modify the console\nto improve its reliability. Modifications include a reduction in the number,\nsize, and placement of components, the addition of dabs of epoxy on the\ncorners and edges of the CPU and GPU as glue to prevent movement relative to\nthe board during heat expansion,[107] and a second GPU heatsink to dissipate\nmore heat.[108] With the release of the redesigned Xbox 360 S, the warranty\nfor the newer models does not include the three-year extended coverage for\n\"General Hardware Failures\".[109] The newer Xbox 360 S and E models indicate\nsystem overheating when the console's power button begins to flash red, unlike\nprevious models where the first and third quadrant of the ring would light up\nred around the power button if overheating occurred. The system will then warn\nthe user of imminent system shutdown until the system has cooled,[110] whereas\na flashing power button that alternates between green and red is an indication\nof a \"General Hardware Failure\" unlike older models where three of the\nquadrants would light up red.[111]\n\n## Software\n\n### Games\n\nMain article: [List of Xbox 360 games](/wiki/List_of_Xbox_360_games \"List of\nXbox 360 games\")\n\nSee also: [List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox\n360](/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360 \"List of Xbox games\ncompatible with Xbox 360\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Rock_of_Ages_-\n_Renaissance.jpg/260px-Rock_of_Ages_-\n_Renaissance.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rock_of_Ages_-_Renaissance.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rock_of_Ages_-_Renaissance.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[Rock of Ages](/wiki/Rock_of_Ages_\\(video_game\\) \"Rock of Ages \\(video\ngame\\)\")_ , one of many [Unreal Engine 3](/wiki/Unreal_Engine_3 \"Unreal Engine\n3\") powered games available on Xbox 360.\n\nThe Xbox 360 launched with 14 [games](/wiki/Xbox_360_launch_title \"Xbox 360\nlaunch title\") in North America and 13 in Europe.

Its new Xbox Guide\nretains all Dashboard functionality (including the Marketplace browser and\ndisk ejection) and the original \"Blade\" interface (although the color scheme\nhas been changed to match that of the NXE Dashboard).[130]\n\nThe NXE also provides many new features. Users can now install games from disc\nto the hard drive to play them with reduced load time and less disc drive\nnoise, but each game's disc must remain in the system in order to run. A new,\nbuilt-in Community system allows the creation of digitized\n[Avatars](/wiki/Avatar_\\(Xbox_360\\) \"Avatar \\(Xbox 360\\)\") that can be used\nfor multiple activities, such as sharing photos or playing\n[Arcade](/wiki/Xbox_Live_Arcade \"Xbox Live Arcade\") games like _[1 vs.\n100](/wiki/1_vs_100_\\(Xbox_360\\) \"1 vs 100 \\(Xbox 360\\)\")_. The update was\nreleased on November 19, 2008.[131]\n\nWhile previous system updates have been stored on internal memory, the NXE\nupdate was the first to require a storage device—at least a 128 MB memory card\nor a [hard drive](/wiki/Hard_disk_drive \"Hard disk drive\").[132]\n\nMicrosoft released a further update to the Xbox 360 Dashboard starting on\nDecember 6, 2011.[133] It included a completely new user interface which\nutilizes Microsoft's [Metro design language](/wiki/Metro_\\(design_language\\)\n\"Metro \\(design language\\)\"), and added new features such as cloud storage for\ngame saves and profiles, live television, [Bing](/wiki/Microsoft_Bing\n\"Microsoft Bing\") voice search,[134] access to YouTube videos and better\nsupport for Kinect voice commands.[135]\n\n### Multimedia\n\nThe Xbox 360 supports videos in [Windows Media\nVideo](/wiki/Windows_Media_Video \"Windows Media Video\") (WMV) format\n(including [high-definition](/wiki/High-definition_television \"High-definition\ntelevision\") and [PlaysForSure](/wiki/Microsoft_PlaysForSure \"Microsoft\nPlaysForSure\") videos), as well as [H.264](/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC\n\"H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\") and [MPEG-4](/wiki/MPEG-4 \"MPEG-4\") media. The December\n2007 dashboard update added support for the playback of [MPEG-4\nASP](/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_2 \"MPEG-4 Part 2\") format videos.[136] The console can\nalso [display pictures](/wiki/Avatar_\\(computing\\) \"Avatar \\(computing\\)\") and\nperform slideshows of photo collections with various transition effects, and\nsupports audio playback, with [music player](/wiki/Digital_audio_player\n\"Digital audio player\") controls accessible through the Xbox 360 Guide button.\nUsers may play back their own music while playing games or using the\ndashboard, and can play music with an interactive visual synthesizer.\n\nMusic, photos and videos can be played from standard USB [mass storage\ndevices](/wiki/Data_storage_device \"Data storage device\"), Xbox 360\nproprietary [storage devices](/wiki/Data_storage_device \"Data storage device\")\n(such as memory cards or Xbox 360 hard drives), and servers or computers with\n[Windows Media Center](/wiki/Windows_Media_Center \"Windows Media Center\") or\n[Windows XP](/wiki/Windows_XP \"Windows XP\") with [Service\npack](/wiki/Service_pack \"Service pack\") 2 or higher within the local-area\nnetwork in streaming mode.[137][138] As the Xbox 360 uses a modified version\nof the [UPnP](/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play \"Universal Plug and Play\") AV\nprotocol,[139] some alternative UPnP servers such as uShare (part of the\n[GeeXboX](/wiki/GeeXboX \"GeeXboX\") project) and [MythTV](/wiki/MythTV\n\"MythTV\") can also stream media to the Xbox 360, allowing for similar\nfunctionality from non-Windows servers. This is possible with video files up\nto HD-resolution and with several [codecs](/wiki/Codec \"Codec\") (MPEG-2,\nMPEG-4, WMV) and [container formats](/wiki/Container_format_\\(digital\\)\n\"Container format \\(digital\\)\") (WMV, MOV, TS).[140]\n\nAs of October 27, 2009,[141] UK and Ireland users are also able to access live\nand on-demand streams of [Sky television](/wiki/Sky_Digital_\\(UK_%26_Ireland\\)\n\"Sky Digital \\(UK & Ireland\\)\") programming.[142]\n\nAt the 2007, 2008, and 2009 [Consumer Electronics\nShows](/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show \"Consumer Electronics Show\"), Microsoft\nhad announced that [IPTV](/wiki/IPTV \"IPTV\") services would soon be made\navailable to use through the Xbox 360. In 2007, Microsoft chairman [Bill\nGates](/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\") stated that IPTV on Xbox 360 was\nexpected to be available to consumers by the holiday season, using the\n[Microsoft TV IPTV Edition](/wiki/Microsoft_TV_IPTV_Edition \"Microsoft TV IPTV\nEdition\") platform.[143] In 2008, Gates and president of Entertainment &\nDevices [Robbie Bach](/wiki/Robert_J._Bach \"Robert J. Bach\") announced a\npartnership with [BT](/wiki/BT_Retail \"BT Retail\") in the United Kingdom, in\nwhich the [BT Vision](/wiki/BT_Vision \"BT Vision\") advanced TV service, using\nthe newer [Microsoft Mediaroom](/wiki/Microsoft_Mediaroom \"Microsoft\nMediaroom\") IPTV platform, would be accessible via Xbox 360, planned for the\nmiddle of the year.[144] BT Vision's DVR-based features would not be available\non Xbox 360 due to limited hard drive capacity.[145] In 2010, while announcing\nversion 2.0 of Microsoft Mediaroom, Microsoft CEO [Steve\nBallmer](/wiki/Steve_Ballmer \"Steve Ballmer\") mentioned that AT&T's\n[U-verse](/wiki/U-verse \"U-verse\") IPTV service would enable Xbox 360s to be\nused as set-top boxes later in the year.[146] As of January 2010, IPTV on Xbox\n360 has yet to be deployed beyond limited trials.\n\nIn 2012, Microsoft released the Live Event Player, allowing for events such as\nvideo game shows, beauty pageants, award shows, concerts, news and sporting\nevents to be streamed on the console via Xbox Live. The first live events\nstreamed on Live were the 2012 [Revolver](/wiki/Revolver_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Revolver \\(magazine\\)\") Golden Gods, Microsoft's E3 2012 media briefing and\nthe [Miss Teen USA 2012](/wiki/Miss_Teen_USA_2012 \"Miss Teen USA 2012\") beauty\npageant.\n\n### XNA community\n\nMain article: [Microsoft XNA](/wiki/Microsoft_XNA \"Microsoft XNA\")\n\nXNA Community is a feature whereby Xbox 360 owners can receive community-\ncreated games, made with Microsoft XNA Game Studio, from the XNA Creators\nClub. The games are written, published, and distributed through a community\nmanaged portal. XNA Community provides a channel for digital videogame\ndelivery over Xbox Live that can be free of royalties, publishers and\nlicenses.[147][148] XNA game sales, however, did not meet original\nexpectations.[149] though [Xbox Live Indie Games](/wiki/Xbox_Live_Indie_Games\n\"Xbox Live Indie Games\") (XBLIG) has had some \"hits.\"\n\n## Services\n\n### Xbox Live\n\nMain article: [Xbox Live](/wiki/Xbox_Live \"Xbox Live\")\n\nWhen the Xbox 360 was released, Microsoft's online gaming service Xbox Live\nwas shut down for 24 hours and underwent a major upgrade, adding a basic non-\nsubscription service called Xbox Live Silver (later renamed Xbox Live Free) to\nits already established premium subscription-based service (which was renamed\nGold). Xbox Live Free is included with all [SKUs](/wiki/Stock-keeping_unit\n\"Stock-keeping unit\") of the console. It allows users to create a user\nprofile, join on [message boards](/wiki/Internet_forum \"Internet forum\"), and\naccess Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade and Marketplace and talk to other\nmembers.[150][151] A Live Free account does not generally support multiplayer\ngaming; however, some games that have rather limited online functions already,\n(such as _[Viva Piñata](/wiki/Viva_Pi%C3%B1ata \"Viva Piñata\")_) or games that\nfeature their own subscription service (e.g. [EA Sports](/wiki/EA_Sports \"EA\nSports\") games) can be played with a Free account. Xbox Live also supports\nvoice the latter a feature possible with the Xbox Live Vision.[152]\n\nXbox Live Gold includes the same features as Free and includes integrated\n[online game](/wiki/Online_game \"Online game\") playing capabilities outside of\nthird-party subscriptions. Microsoft has allowed previous Xbox Live\nsubscribers to maintain their profile information, [friends\nlist](/wiki/Contact_list \"Contact list\"), and games history when they make the\ntransition to Xbox Live Gold. To transfer an Xbox Live account to the new\nsystem, users need to link a [Windows Live ID](/wiki/Windows_Live_ID \"Windows\nLive ID\") to their gamertag on Xbox.com.[153] When users add an Xbox Live\nenabled profile to their console, they are required to provide the console\nwith their passport account information and the last four digits of their\n[credit card number](/wiki/Payment_card_number \"Payment card number\"), which\nis used for verification purposes and billing. An Xbox Live Gold account has\nan annual cost of US$59.99, [C$](/wiki/Canadian_dollar \"Canadian\ndollar\")59.99, [NZ$](/wiki/New_Zealand_dollar \"New Zealand dollar\")90.00,\n[GB£](/wiki/Pound_sterling \"Pound sterling\")39.99, or €59.99. On January 5,\n2011, Xbox Live had reached over 30 million subscribers.[154]\n\n### Xbox Live Marketplace\n\nMain article: [Xbox Live Marketplace](/wiki/Xbox_Live_Marketplace \"Xbox Live\nMarketplace\")\n\nThe Xbox Live Marketplace is a virtual market designed for the console that\nallows Xbox Live users to download purchased or promotional content. The\nservice offers movie and game trailers, [game demos](/wiki/Game_demo \"Game\ndemo\"), Xbox Live Arcade games and Xbox 360 Dashboard themes as well as add-on\ngame content (items, costumes, levels etc.). These features are available to\nboth Free and Gold members on Xbox Live. A hard drive or memory unit is\nrequired to store products purchased from Xbox Live Marketplace.[155] In order\nto download priced content, users are required to purchase [Microsoft\nPoints](/wiki/Microsoft_Points \"Microsoft Points\") for use as\n[scrip](/wiki/Scrip \"Scrip\");[156] though some products (such as trailers and\ndemos) are free to download. Microsoft Points can be obtained through prepaid\ncards in 1,600 and 4,000-point denominations. Microsoft Points can also be\npurchased through Xbox Live with a credit card in 500, 1,000, 2,000 and\n5,000-point denominations. Users are able to view items available to download\non the service through a PC via the [Xbox Live\nMarketplace](/wiki/Xbox_Live_Marketplace \"Xbox Live Marketplace\")\nwebsite.[157] An estimated seventy percent of Xbox Live users have downloaded\nitems from the Marketplace.[158]\n\n### Xbox Live Arcade\n\nMain article: [Xbox Live Arcade](/wiki/Xbox_Live_Arcade \"Xbox Live Arcade\")\n\nXbox Live Arcade is an online service operated by Microsoft that is used to\ndistribute downloadable video games to Xbox and Xbox 360 owners. In addition\nto classic [arcade games](/wiki/Arcade_game \"Arcade game\") such as _[Ms. Pac-\nMan](/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man \"Ms. Pac-Man\")_ , the service offers some new original\ngames like _[Assault Heroes](/wiki/Assault_Heroes \"Assault Heroes\")_. The Xbox\nLive Arcade also features games from other consoles, such as the\n[PlayStation](/wiki/PlayStation \"PlayStation\") game _[Castlevania: Symphony of\nthe Night](/wiki/Castlevania:_Symphony_of_the_Night \"Castlevania: Symphony of\nthe Night\")_ and [PC games](/wiki/Personal_computer_game \"Personal computer\ngame\") such as _[Zuma](/wiki/Zuma_\\(video_game\\) \"Zuma \\(video game\\)\")_. The\nservice was first launched on November 3, 2004,[159] using a DVD to load, and\noffered games for about US$5 to $15. Items are purchased using Microsoft\nPoints, a proprietary currency used to reduce credit card transaction charges.\nOn November 22, 2005, Xbox Live Arcade was re-launched with the release of the\nXbox 360, in which it was now integrated with the Xbox 360's dashboard. The\ngames are generally aimed toward more casual gamers; examples of the more\npopular games are _[Geometry Wars](/wiki/Geometry_Wars \"Geometry Wars\")_ ,\n_[Street Fighter II' Hyper Fighting](/wiki/Street_Fighter_II \"Street Fighter\nII\")_, and _[Uno](/wiki/Uno_\\(video_game\\) \"Uno \\(video game\\)\")_.[160] On\nMarch 24, 2010, Microsoft introduced the [Game Room](/wiki/Game_Room \"Game\nRoom\") to Xbox Live. Game Room is a gaming service for Xbox 360 and Microsoft\nWindows that lets players compete in classic arcade and console games in a\nvirtual arcade.[161]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/DVD-\nROM_for_Xbox_360.jpg/220px-DVD-ROM_for_Xbox_360.jpg)](/wiki/File:DVD-\nROM_for_Xbox_360.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:DVD-ROM_for_Xbox_360.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDVD-ROM for Xbox 360\n\n### Movies & TV\n\nMain article: [Microsoft Movies & TV](/wiki/Microsoft_Movies_%26_TV \"Microsoft\nMovies & TV\")\n\nOn November 6, 2006, Microsoft announced the Xbox Video Marketplace, an\nexclusive video store accessible through the console. Launched in the United\nStates on November 22, 2006, the first anniversary of the Xbox 360's launch,\nthe service allows users in the United States to download high-definition and\nstandard-definition television shows and movies onto an Xbox 360 console for\nviewing. With the exception of short clips, content is not currently available\nfor streaming, and must be downloaded. Movies are also available for rental.\nThey expire in 14 days after download or at the end of the first 24 hours\nafter the movie has begun playing, whichever comes first. Television episodes\ncan be purchased to own, and are transferable to an unlimited number of\nconsoles. Downloaded files use 5.1 [surround audio](/wiki/Surround_sound\n\"Surround sound\") and are encoded using [VC-1](/wiki/VC-1 \"VC-1\") for video at\n720p, with a [bitrate](/wiki/Bit_rate \"Bit rate\") of 6.8 Mbit/s.[162]\nTelevision content is offered from MTV, [VH1](/wiki/VH1 \"VH1\"), [Comedy\nCentral](/wiki/Comedy_Central \"Comedy Central\"), [Turner\nBroadcasting](/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System \"Turner Broadcasting System\"),\nand [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\"); and movie content is [Warner\nBros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\"),\n[Paramount](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount Pictures\"), and\n[Disney](/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company \"The Walt Disney Company\"), along with\nother publishers.[163]\n\nAfter the Spring 2007 update, the following [video codecs](/wiki/Video_codec\n\"Video codec\") are supported:\n\n  * H.264 video support: Up to 15 Mbit/s, Baseline, Main, and High (up to level 4.1) Profiles with [2 channel](/wiki/2channel \"2channel\") AAC LC and Main Profiles.\n  * MPEG-4 Part 2 video support: Up to 8 Mbit/s, Simple Profile with 2 channel AAC LC and Main Profiles.\n\nAs a late addition to the December Xbox 360 update, 25 movies were added to\nthe European Xbox 360 video market place on the December 11, 2007 and cost 250\nMicrosoft points for the SD version on the movie and 380 points for the HD\nversion of the movie.[164] Xbox Live members in Canada featured the ability to\ngo on the Xbox Live Marketplace also as of December 11, 2007 with around 30\nmovies to be downloaded for the same amount of Microsoft Points.[165]\n\nOn May 26, 2009, Microsoft announced it would release the [Zune\nHD](/wiki/Zune_HD \"Zune HD\") (in the fall of 2009), which was then the next\naddition to the [Zune](/wiki/Zune \"Zune\") product range. This was of an impact\non the Xbox Live Video Store as it was also announced that the Zune Video\nMarketplace and the Xbox Live Video Store will be merged to form the [Zune\nMarketplace](/wiki/Zune_Marketplace \"Zune Marketplace\"), which will be\narriving on Xbox Live in 7 countries initially, the United Kingdom, the United\nStates, France, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Spain.[166] Further details were\nreleased at the Microsoft press conference at [E3 2009](/wiki/E3_2009 \"E3\n2009\").[167]\n\nOn October 16, 2012, Xbox Video and Xbox Music were released, replacing the\nZune Marketplace.

They can also use\ntheir mobile device as a remote to control the Xbox 360 console.[172]\n\n## Game development\n\nPartnerNet, the developers-only alternative [Xbox Live](/wiki/Xbox_Live \"Xbox\nLive\") network used by developers to beta test game content downloads and\ngames developed for [Xbox Live Arcade](/wiki/Xbox_Live_Arcade \"Xbox Live\nArcade\"),[173] runs on Xbox 360 [debug](/wiki/Debugging \"Debugging\") kits,\nwhich are used both by developers and by the gaming press. In a podcast\nreleased on February 12, 2007, a developer breached the PartnerNet [non-\ndisclosure agreement](/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement \"Non-disclosure\nagreement\") (NDA) by commenting that he had found a playable version of\n_[Alien Hominid](/wiki/Alien_Hominid \"Alien Hominid\")_ and an unplayable\nversion of _[Ikaruga](/wiki/Ikaruga \"Ikaruga\")_ on PartnerNet. A few video\ngame journalists, misconstruing the breach of the NDA as an invalidation of\nthe NDA, immediately began reporting on other games being tested via\nPartnerNet, including a remake of _[Jetpac](/wiki/Jetpac \"Jetpac\")_.[174]\n(_Alien Hominid_ for the Xbox 360 was released on February 28 of that year,\nand _Ikaruga_ was released over a year later on April 9, 2008. _Jetpac_ was\nreleased for the Xbox 360 on March 28, 2007 as _[Jetpac\nRefuelled](/wiki/Jetpac_Refuelled \"Jetpac Refuelled\")_.) There have also been\nnumerous video and screenshot leaks of game footage on PartnerNet, as well as\na complete version of _[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode\nI](/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_4:_Episode_I \"Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I\")_ ,\nwhich caused for the whole PartnerNet service to be shut down overnight on\nApril 3, 2010.[175] In the following days, [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft\n\"Microsoft\") reminded developers and journalists that they were in breach of\nNDA by sharing information about PartnerNet content and asked websites to\nremove lists of games in development that were discovered on the\nservice.[176]. Sega used feedback from fans about the leaked version of Sonic\nthe Hedgehog 4: Episode I to refine it before they eventually released\nit.[177] Additionally, a pair of hackers played their modded Halo 3 games on\nPartnerNet in addition to using PartnerNet to scoop up unreleased and untested\nsoftware. The duo passed their hacked Halo pics to their friends before they\nwere eventually caught by Bungie engineers who left a message for the hackers\non PartnerNet which read \"Winners Don't Break Into PartnerNet.\".[178] Other\ngames that were leaked in the PartnerNet fiasco include\n[Shenmue](/wiki/Shenmue \"Shenmue\") and Shenmue 2.[179]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [List of Xbox 360 games](/wiki/List_of_Xbox_360_games \"List of Xbox 360 games\")\n  * [List of original programs distributed by Xbox Entertainment Studios](/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Xbox_Entertainment_Studios \"List of original programs distributed by Xbox Entertainment Studios\")\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Radd, David (August 16, 2005).
