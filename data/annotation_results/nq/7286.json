Both Watson and Gould dropped out of school and\nformed the band The Funnest Game.[n 2] Their brand of electric/[old-\ntime](/wiki/Old_time_music \"Old time music\") was heavily influenced by the\n[old-time music](/wiki/Old_time_music \"Old time music\") scene prominent in\n[Tompkins](/wiki/Tompkins_County \"Tompkins County\") and [Schuyler County, New\nYork](/wiki/Schuyler_County,_New_York \"Schuyler County, New York\"), including\n[The Horse Flies](/wiki/The_Horse_Flies \"The Horse Flies\") and The Highwoods\nStringband.\n\n### \"Wagon\nWheel\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Old_Crow_Medicine_Show&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: \"Wagon Wheel\"\")]\n\nMain article: [Wagon Wheel (song)](/wiki/Wagon_Wheel_\\(song\\) \"Wagon Wheel\n\\(song\\)\")\n\nFuqua, school friend and future bandmate, first brought home a [Bob\nDylan](/wiki/Bob_Dylan \"Bob Dylan\") [bootleg](/wiki/Bootleg_recording \"Bootleg\nrecording\") from a family trip to [London](/wiki/London \"London\") containing a\nrough outtake called \"Rock Me, Mama\" (from the \"[Pat Garrett and Billy The\nKid](/wiki/Pat_Garrett_and_Billy_The_Kid \"Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid\")\"\nsoundtrack sessions) and passed it to Secor.[i 3] Not \"so much a song as a\nsketch, crudely recorded featuring most prominently a stomping boot, the\ncandy-coated chorus and a mumbled verse that was hard to make out\",[20] the\ntune kept going through Secor's mind. A few months later, while attending\n[Phillips Exeter Academy](/wiki/Phillips_Exeter_Academy \"Phillips Exeter\nAcademy\") in New Hampshire, and \"feeling homesick for the South,\" he added\nverses about \"hitchhiking his way home full of romantic notions put in his\nhead by the [Beat poets](/wiki/Beat_poets \"Beat poets\") and, most of all,\nDylan.\" Dylan was a major influence on the young musician, as he puts it:\n\n> I listened to Bob Dylan and nothing else.

I\n> was a teenager who was really turned on to Bob.[20]\n\nThe Dylan outtake, generally titled \"Rock Me Mama\", came out of recording\nsessions for the _[Pat Garrett and Billy the\nKid](/wiki/Pat_Garrett_%26_Billy_the_Kid_\\(album\\) \"Pat Garrett & Billy the\nKid \\(album\\)\")_ movie soundtrack (1973) in [Burbank,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Burbank,_California \"Burbank, California\").[21][22] Secor\nsays it \". . was an outtake of something he had mumbled out on one of those\ntapes. I sang it all around the country from about 17 to 26, before I ever\neven thought, 'oh I better look into this.'\"[12]\n\nWhen Secor sought copyright on the song in 2003 to release it on\n_[O.C.M.S.](/wiki/Old_Crow_Medicine_Show_\\(album\\) \"Old Crow Medicine Show\n\\(album\\)\")_ in (2004), he discovered Dylan credited the phrase \"Rock me,\nmama\" to [bluesman](/wiki/Blues \"Blues\") [Arthur \"Big Boy\"\nCrudup](/wiki/Arthur_Crudup \"Arthur Crudup\"), who likely got it from a [Big\nBill Broonzy](/wiki/Big_Bill_Broonzy \"Big Bill Broonzy\") recording. As Secor\nsays: \"In a way, it's taken something like 85 years to get completed.\"[23]\nSecor and Dylan signed a co-writing agreement, and share copyright[w 5] on the\nsong; agreeing to a \"50-50 split in authorship.\"[7]\n\nSecor later met Dylan's son, Jakob, who said \"it made sense that I was a\nteenager when I did that, because no one in their 30s would have the guts to\ntry to write a Bob Dylan song.\"[23] The song would be an early entry in the\ngroup's catalog when it formed a few years later. Officially released twice,\non an early EP and their second album (\"O.C.M.S.\" in 2004), the song would\nbecome the group's signature song—going gold in 2011 and platinum in 2013.[13]\n\n### Upstate New York/Canada/North\nCarolina[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Old_Crow_Medicine_Show&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Upstate New York/Canada/North Carolina\")]\n\nAfter the breakup of the Route 11 Boys, Secor attended [Ithaca\nCollege](/wiki/Ithaca_College \"Ithaca College\").[1][19]:5 He brought Fuqua up\nto New York State, where they met Willie Watson. Watson dissolved The Funnest\nGame and they assembled players all around [Ithaca, New\nYork](/wiki/Ithaca,_New_York \"Ithaca, New York\") \"where there is a very lively\nold-time music scene\",[n 3] including Kevin Hayes[19]:5 They recorded an album\nthat they could sell on the road—a cassette of ten songs called\n_Trans:mission_. Fuqua says of the influence of that region . .\n\n> Ithaca and that surrounding area was a big influence on us. We wouldn't be\n> here without a lot of the people we met there, like Richie Stearns, the Red\n> Hots and Mac Benford. All those old-time banjo players brought the music\n> from the South back up to New York, and it was kind of a hotbed.[25]\n\nThe group left Ithaca for their _Trans:mission_ tour in October 1998. They\nbusked their way west across [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") and circled back\neast again in the Spring of 1999 when they moved into a farmhouse on [Beech\nMountain](/wiki/Beech_Mountain_\\(North_Carolina\\) \"Beech Mountain \\(North\nCarolina\\)\"), near [Boone, North Carolina](/wiki/Boone,_North_Carolina \"Boone,\nNorth Carolina\").
