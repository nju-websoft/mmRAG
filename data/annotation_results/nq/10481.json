The celebrities compete\nfor $100,000 to be donated to their chosen charity. The series is set in\n[Kruger National Park](/wiki/Kruger_National_Park \"Kruger National Park\"),\n[South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\"),[2][3] and is hosted by\n[Julia Morris](/wiki/Julia_Morris \"Julia Morris\") and [Chris\nBrown](/wiki/Chris_Brown_\\(veterinarian\\) \"Chris Brown \\(veterinarian\\)\").[4]\n\nOn 16 July 2015 the series was renewed for a second season,[5] which premiered\non 31 January 2016.[6] The second season was accompanied by the companion\nseries [''I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\nNow!''](/w/index.php?title=%27%27I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_Now!%27%27&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"''I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

On 1\nAugust 2016 the series was renewed for a third season with Morris and Brown\nreturning as hosts,[8] which premiered on 29 January 2017.

During their\ntime in the jungle they are isolated from the outside world and are not\ncommonly aware of outside events. The contestants compete for $100,000 to be\ndonated to a charity of their choosing, in addition to being personally\nreimbursed for their participation.[9] While in the jungle, some of the\ncontestants (generally voted by the viewing public) compete in challenges for\nfood and luxuries for the camp. These challenges often involve local wildlife\nand are meant to take the contestants out of their comfort zone. Each week one\nor more of the contestants are evicted from the jungle, based on viewer votes.\nIn addition, if the contestants become overwhelmed by their situation they can\nleave the series by speaking the phrase _\" I'm a celebrity get me out of\nhere!\"_. However, it is reported that if contestants do quit they will have\ntheir income for participating in the series markedly reduced.[10] Throughout\nthe show, additional contestants (called \"intruders\") enter the competition;\nand beginning with season two, some contestants are only included temporarily\n(i.e. having a guest appearance).[11] In the end, a final viewer vote occurs\nto determine the winner of the series, who is given the title of \"King and/or\nQueen of the Jungle\".\n\n### Tucker\ntrials[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Tucker trials\")]\n\nThe contestants take part in daily trials to earn food. These trials aim to\ntest both physical and mental abilities. The winner is usually determined by\nthe number of stars collected during the trial, with each star representing a\nmeal earned by the winning contestant for their camp mates.\n\n### Celebrity chest\nchallenges[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Celebrity chest challenges\")]\n\nTwo or more celebrities are chosen to take part in the _celebrity chest_\nchallenge to win luxuries for camp. Each challenge involves completing a task\nto win a chest to take back to camp. However, to win the luxury item in the\nchest, the campmates must correctly answer a question. If they fail to answer\ncorrectly, the luxury item is forfeited and a joke prize is won. The luxury\nitem is \"donated\" by a celebrity from the outside.\n\n### Secret\nmission[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Secret mission\")]\n\nThis is a challenge where some celebrities have to take part without alerting\nthe other celebrities - if they are successful in their 'missions', they are\nrewarded.\n\n### Mystery\nbox[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Mystery box\")]\n\nA _mystery box_ sees a box delivered to the campsite, each time containing a\ndifferent gift for the contestants.\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nBroadcast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Broadcast\")]\n\nThe show is broadcast Sunday to Thursday at 7.30 pm, with a weekly eviction\nshow on Sunday (except for the first week, where the celebrities arrive in the\n'jungle'). All shows are presented by Julia Morris & Chris Brown from a nearby\nstudio. The program is live to AEDT States (New South Wales, Victoria,\nTasmania and the Australian Capital Territory), in other states the program is\ndelayed to accommodate local time zones.\n\n### The fallout\nzone[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: The fallout zone\")]\n\nIn addition to the television broadcast, for the first season a live feed from\nthe camp site aired for an hour after the AEDT airing of the show on Ten's\nwebsite and mobile app, titled _The Fallout Zone_ but more commonly referred\nto as _FOZ_. The content of feed was available on the website after the fact\nso viewers in other states could watch the show after their airing of the main\nshow. The feed was hosted by comedian [Sam Mac](/wiki/Sam_Mac \"Sam Mac\") and\nproducer Ciaran \"The Butcher\" Flannery, also known as \"The C-Word\". On 8 and\n12 March 2015, producer Dominic \"The Domin8or\" Sullivan filled in during\nFlannery's absence. The duo interact with viewers through Twitter, using the\nhashtag #FOZ. Mac and Flannery have no control over the shots used in the\nstream which has resulted in one episode featuring a 20-minute shot of a\nwaterfall and, on 16 February 2015, a 15-minute conversation featuring a sound\ntechnician looking for Bob being picked up. On 5 March 2015 the show famously\nfeatured audio problems during which Mac and Flannery's voices fluctuated\nbetween chipmunk and Darth Vader filters for the first thirty minutes. The\nshow's theme song is Highway to the Fallout Zone sung by Sam Mac. The show did\nnot return for the second season.\n\n### Public\nvoting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Public voting\")]\n\nThroughout the show the public votes on who competes in the following tucker\ntrial and who to evict from the campsite. Viewers can either vote via\n[SMS](/wiki/SMS \"SMS\") (by texting the name of the celebrity to 1995 1010) or\nvote via [Social Media](/wiki/Social_Media \"Social Media\") (namely\n[Facebook](/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\") or [Twitter](/wiki/Twitter \"Twitter\"))\nby using the celebrity's hashtag (#celeb[name]). Voting via social media is\nlimited to 20 votes per account. For tucker trial voting, viewers vote for\ncelebrity they wish to compete. For eviction voting, viewers vote for a\ncelebrity to stay. Voting closes at approximately 7:30pm AEDT for Sunday's\neviction vote and at approximately 8pm AEDT for voting on other days.\n\nPrior to the premiere of the second season, it was announced that the voting\nprocess would change slightly compared to the inaugural season. SMS voting wil\nbe used for both trial and eviction voting while Twitter voting will be used\nexclusively for trial voting. This change was implemented to even the playing\nfield between celebrities with a larger international fan base (who are more\nlikely to receive Twitter votes from said fan base) and celebrities with a\nsmaller fan base who are only known in Australia.[12] However, this decision\nwas later reversed, allowing Twitter and Facebook votes for the finals.[13]\n\n## Series\noverview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Series overview\")]\n\nWinners crowned King or Queen of their respective year.\n\nKey:\n\n     King of the Jungle\n     Queen of the Jungle\nSeason | Presenters | Start date | End date | Days in camp | Campmates | Honour places  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nWinner | Second place | Third place  \n[1](/wiki/I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australia_season_1\\) \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! \\(Australia season 1\\)\") | [Chris Brown](/wiki/Chris_Brown_\\(veterinarian\\) \"Chris Brown \\(veterinarian\\)\") and [Julia Morris](/wiki/Julia_Morris \"Julia Morris\") | 1 February 2015 (2015-02-01) | 15 March 2015 (2015-03-15) | 45 | 14 | [Freddie Flintoff](/wiki/Freddie_Flintoff \"Freddie Flintoff\") | [Barry Hall](/wiki/Barry_Hall \"Barry Hall\") | [Chrissie Swan](/wiki/Chrissie_Swan \"Chrissie Swan\")  \n[2](/wiki/I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australia_season_2\\) \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! \\(Australia season 2\\)\") | 31 January 2016 (2016-01-31) | 13 March 2016 (2016-03-13) | 45 | 12 | [Brendan Fevola](/wiki/Brendan_Fevola \"Brendan Fevola\") | [Paul Harragon](/wiki/Paul_Harragon \"Paul Harragon\") | [Laurina Fleure](/wiki/Laurina_Fleure \"Laurina Fleure\")  \n[3](/wiki/I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australia_season_3\\) \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! \\(Australia season 3\\)\") | 29 January 2017 (2017-01-29) | 13 March 2017 (2017-03-13) | 46 | 14 | [Casey Donovan](/wiki/Casey_Donovan_\\(singer\\) \"Casey Donovan \\(singer\\)\") | [Dane Swan](/wiki/Dane_Swan \"Dane Swan\") | [Natalie Bassingthwaighte](/wiki/Natalie_Bassingthwaighte \"Natalie Bassingthwaighte\")  \n[4](/wiki/I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australia_season_4\\) \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! \\(Australia season 4\\)\") | 28 January 2018 (2018-01-28) | 12 March 2018 (2018-03-12) | 45 | 15 | [Fiona O'Loughlin](/wiki/Fiona_O%27Loughlin_\\(comedian\\) \"Fiona O'Loughlin \\(comedian\\)\") | [Shannon Noll](/wiki/Shannon_Noll \"Shannon Noll\") | [Danny Green](/wiki/Danny_Green_\\(boxer\\) \"Danny Green \\(boxer\\)\")  \n  \n## Series\nresults[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Series results\")]\n\nKey\n\n     Winner â€“ King or Queen of the Jungle\n     Runner-up\n     Third place\n     Late arrival\n     Evicted\n     Withdrew\n\n### Season 1\n(2015)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_a_Celebrity...Get_Me_Out_of_Here!_\\(Australian_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Season 1 \\(2015\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!
