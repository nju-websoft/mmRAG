The restaurant serves breakfast\nbefore transitioning to its lunch and dinner menu. Chick-fil-A also offers\ncustomers catered selections from its menu for special events.[5] Many of the\ncompany's values are influenced by its [founder's](/wiki/S._Truett_Cathy \"S.\nTruett Cathy\") Southern Baptist beliefs;[6] all Chick-fil-A restaurants are\nclosed for business on Sundays as well as on [Thanksgiving](/wiki/Thanksgiving\n\"Thanksgiving\") and [Christmas](/wiki/Christmas \"Christmas\").[6]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Business model\n  * 3 Advertising\n  * 4 Sponsored events\n  * 5 Related restaurants\n    * 5.1 The Hapeville Dwarf House\n    * 5.2 Dwarf House\n    * 5.3 Truett's Grill\n  * 6 Corporate culture\n    * 6.1 Same-sex marriage controversy\n      * 6.1.1 Response\n      * 6.1.2 Report of policy change\n  * 7 Recipe changes\n  * 8 Plan to raise its chickens without antibiotics\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 References\n  * 11 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nThe chain's origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill (now the Dwarf House), a\nrestaurant opened by [S. Truett Cathy](/wiki/S._Truett_Cathy \"S. Truett\nCathy\"), the chain's former chairman and CEO, in 1946. The restaurant is\nlocated in [Hapeville, Georgia](/wiki/Hapeville,_Georgia \"Hapeville,\nGeorgia\"), a suburb of Atlanta,[3] and is near the location of the now-\ndemolished Ford Motor Company [Atlanta Assembly](/wiki/Atlanta_Assembly\n\"Atlanta Assembly\") Plant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's\npatrons.\n\nIn 1961, after 15 years in the fast food business, Cathy found a pressure-\nfryer that could cook the chicken sandwich in the same amount of time it took\nto cook a fast-food hamburger.[7] Following this discovery, he registered the\nname Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, _\" We Didn't Invent\nthe Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,\"_[8] refers to their flagship menu\nitem, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich.\n\nThe first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the [Greenbriar\nMall](/wiki/Greenbriar_Mall \"Greenbriar Mall\"), in a suburb of Atlanta.[3]\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by opening new franchises\nin suburban malls' food courts.[9] The first freestanding franchise was opened\nApril 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia,[10] and the\ncompany began to focus more on this type of franchise than on the food court\ntype. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most\nnew restaurants are located in Southern suburban areas.[3] In October 2015,\nthe company opened a three-story 5,000-square-foot restaurant in\n[Manhattan](/wiki/Manhattan \"Manhattan\") that became the largest free-standing\nChick-fil-A in the country at that time.[11][12] As of 2016, the chain has\napproximately 1,950 locations.[3] It also has 31 [drive-through](/wiki/Drive-\nthrough \"Drive-through\")-only locations.[3] Chick-fil-A also can be found at\nuniversities, hospitals, and airports through licensing agreements.[3]\n\nSince 1997, the Atlanta-based company has been the title sponsor of the [Peach\nBowl](/wiki/Peach_Bowl \"Peach Bowl\"), an annual [college\nfootball](/wiki/College_football \"College football\") bowl game played in\nAtlanta on [New Year's Eve](/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve \"New Year's Eve\"). Chick-\nfil-A also is a key sponsor of the [SEC](/wiki/Southeastern_Conference\n\"Southeastern Conference\") and the [ACC](/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference\n\"Atlantic Coast Conference\") of college athletics.[13][14]\n\nThe company expanded for the first time outside of the United States by\nopening an outlet at the [Calgary International\nAirport](/wiki/Calgary_International_Airport \"Calgary International Airport\")\nin [Calgary](/wiki/Calgary \"Calgary\"), Alberta, Canada in May 2014.[15][16]\nThis restaurant is located near the departure area for flights bound for the\nUnited States.[15] However, per tradition, it is closed Sundays and Christmas\nDay.\n\n## Business model[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Business model\")]\n\nChick-fil-A retains ownership of each restaurant. Chick-fil-A selects the\nrestaurant location and builds it.[17] Chick-fil-A franchisees need only a\n$10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[18] Each operator is\nhandpicked and goes through a rigorous training program; the interviews plus\ntraining can take months and is not an easy process. Chick-fil-A states on\ntheir site:  \n  \n\"This is not the right opportunity for you if you:  \n\\- Are seeking a passive investment in a business.  \n\\- Want to sell property to Chick-fil-A, Inc.  \n\\- Are requesting that Chick-fil-A, Inc. build at a specified location.  \n\\- Are seeking multi-unit franchise opportunities.\"  \n  \nThis goes to show how vastly different it is to be a Chick-fil-A store\noperator rather than being part of a regular franchise opportunity.[19] Since\n2010, Chick-fil-A has led the fast food industry in average sales per\nrestaurant, despite being open only six days a week,[20] earning an average\n$4.8 million per restaurant in 2016 ([Whataburger](/wiki/Whataburger\n\"Whataburger\") was second with $2.7 million per restaurant).[21]\n\n## Advertising[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Advertising\")]\n\n\"Eat Mor Chikin\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by\n[The Richards Group](/wiki/The_Richards_Group \"The Richards Group\") in 1995.\nThe slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring\n[Holstein](/wiki/Holstein_Friesian_cattle \"Holstein Friesian cattle\") dairy\ncows[22] that are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read:\n\"Eat Mor Chikin\" in all capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily\nhalted during a [mad cow disease](/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy\n\"Bovine spongiform encephalopathy\") scare on January 1, 2004, so as not to\nmake the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare\nto increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows\nreplaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an\n[anthropomorphized](/wiki/Anthropomorphic \"Anthropomorphic\") chicken who still\nappears as the C on the logo.[23]\n\nChick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending [cease and\ndesist](/wiki/Cease_and_desist \"Cease and desist\") letters to those they think\nhave infringed on their trademarks.[24] The corporation has successfully\nprotested at least 30 instances of the use of an \"eat more\" phrase, saying\nthat the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness\nof their intellectual property, and diminish its value.[25]\n\nA 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who [screen\nprints](/wiki/Screen_printing \"Screen printing\") T-shirts reading: \"Eat More\nKale\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his\nwebsite.[26] The incident drew criticism from Vermont governor [Peter\nShumlin](/wiki/Peter_Shumlin \"Peter Shumlin\"), and created backlash against\nwhat he termed Chick-fil-A's \"corporate bullying.\"[27] On December 11, 2014,\nBo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application\nto trademark his \"Eat More Kale\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory\ntook place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the\nStatehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the\nsupport of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of\nNew Hampshire legal clinic.[28]\n\nAfter 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to [McCann New\nYork](/wiki/McCann_Erickson \"McCann Erickson\") in 2016. Along with the cows,\nads included famous people in history in a campaign called \"Chicken for\nBreakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\"[29]\n\n## Sponsored events[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-\nfil-A&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Sponsored events\")]\n\nChick-fil-A Classic\n\n    The Chick-fil-A Classic is a high school basketball tournament held in [Columbia, South Carolina](/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina \"Columbia, South Carolina\").[30] The tournament is in its eighth year of operation and features nationally ranked players, and teams.[31] The tournament is co-sponsored by the Greater Columbia Educational Advancement Foundation (GCEAF), which provides scholarships to high school seniors in the greater Columbia area.\n\n[Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl](/wiki/Peach_Bowl \"Peach Bowl\")\n\n    The Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl is a college football [bowl game](/wiki/Bowl_game \"Bowl game\") played each year in [Atlanta, Georgia](/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia \"Atlanta, Georgia\").\n\n[Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game](/wiki/Chick-fil-A_Kickoff_Game \"Chick-fil-A Kickoff\nGame\")\n\n    The Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game is an annual early-season college football game played at the [Mercedes-Benz Stadium](/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Stadium \"Mercedes-Benz Stadium\") in Atlanta, Georgia; before 2017, it was played at the [Georgia Dome](/wiki/Georgia_Dome \"Georgia Dome\"). It features two highly ranked teams, one of which has always been from the Southeastern Conference. In the 2012 season and again in the 2014 season, the event was expanded to two games. It will also be two games in 2017.\n\n[Chick-fil-A Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America](/wiki/Chick-fil-\nA_Kyle_Petty_Charity_Ride_Across_America \"Chick-fil-A Kyle Petty Charity Ride\nAcross America\")\n\n    The Chick-fil-A Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America is an annual charity motorcycle tour to raise money for, among other charities, Victory Junction, a camp for terminally ill children.\n\n## Related restaurants[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-\nfil-A&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Related restaurants\")]\n\n### The Hapeville Dwarf House[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-\nfil-A&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: The Hapeville Dwarf House\")]\n\nTruett Cathy opened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill – later renamed the\nDwarf House – in [Hapeville, Georgia](/wiki/Hapeville,_Georgia \"Hapeville,\nGeorgia\"), in 1946, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich\nthere.[3] At the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-\nsize entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.[32] The\noriginal Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a\nweek, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at\n10:00 p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas\nand reopens at 6 a.m. on Monday mornings and day after Thanksgiving and\nChristmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations\nas well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant.[32]\nIt was across the street from the former [Ford Motor\nCompany](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company \"Ford Motor Company\") factory called\n[Atlanta Assembly](/wiki/Atlanta_Assembly \"Atlanta Assembly\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Chick-fil-\na_Dwarf_House_entrance%2C_Griffin.JPG/220px-Chick-fil-\na_Dwarf_House_entrance%2C_Griffin.JPG)](/wiki/File:Chick-fil-\na_Dwarf_House_entrance,_Griffin.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chick-fil-a_Dwarf_House_entrance,_Griffin.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nDwarf House in [Griffin, Georgia](/wiki/Griffin,_Georgia \"Griffin, Georgia\")\n\n### Dwarf House[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Dwarf House\")]\n\nTruett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and\nprovide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a\ndrive-thru window. As of\n2012[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit),\n13 Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants were operating in the metro Atlanta\narea.[3]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Truett%27s_Grill%2C_Griffin.JPG/220px-\nTruett%27s_Grill%2C_Griffin.JPG)](/wiki/File:Truett%27s_Grill,_Griffin.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Truett%27s_Grill,_Griffin.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nTruett's Grill in [Griffin, Georgia](/wiki/Griffin,_Georgia \"Griffin,\nGeorgia\")\n\n### Truett's Grill[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Truett's Grill\")]\n\nIn 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in [Morrow,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Morrow,_Georgia \"Morrow, Georgia\"). The second location opened\nin 2003 in [McDonough, Georgia](/wiki/McDonough,_Georgia \"McDonough,\nGeorgia\"), and a third location opened in 2006 in [Griffin,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Griffin,_Georgia \"Griffin, Georgia\").[33] Similar to the Chick-\nfil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional,\nsit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed\ndinner.[34][35][36] In 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House\nlocations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.[37][38]\n\n## Corporate culture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-\nfil-A&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Corporate culture\")]\n\nS. Truett Cathy was a devout [Southern Baptist](/wiki/Southern_Baptist\n\"Southern Baptist\"); his religious beliefs had a major impact on the\ncompany.[39] The company's official statement of corporate purpose says that\nthe business exists \"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is\nentrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with\nChick-fil-A.\"[40]\n\nCathy's beliefs are also responsible for one of the chain's distinctive\nfeatures: all Chick-fil-A locations (corporate owned and franchised) are\n[closed on Sundays](/wiki/Sunday_shopping \"Sunday shopping\"),[41] as well as\non [Thanksgiving](/wiki/Thanksgiving_\\(United_States\\) \"Thanksgiving \\(United\nStates\\)\") and [Christmas](/wiki/Christmas \"Christmas\").[42] Cathy states as\nthe final step in his Five-Step recipe for Business Success \"I was not so\ncommitted to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and\npriorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close\non Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of\ndirecting our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\"[43]\n\nIn an interview with ABC News's _[Nightline](/wiki/Nightline \"Nightline\")_ ,\nTruett's son [Dan T. Cathy](/wiki/Dan_T._Cathy \"Dan T. Cathy\") told reporter\n[Vicki Mabrey](/wiki/Vicki_Mabrey \"Vicki Mabrey\") that the company is also\nclosed on Sundays because \"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And\nSunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that\nfirst Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like\nworking on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\" The younger Cathy also\nquoted his father as saying, \"I don't want to ask people to do that what I am\nnot willing to do myself.\"[44]\n\nTheir website states, \"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our\nRestaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect\n–regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\"[45]\n\nChick-fil-A's reputation on being closed on Sundays extends to non-traditional\nlocations. In addition to countless shopping malls and airports, a Chick-fil-A\nlocation at [Mercedes-Benz Stadium](/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Stadium \"Mercedes-Benz\nStadium\") in Atlanta will be closed on Sundays despite its main tenant, the\n[Atlanta Falcons](/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons \"Atlanta Falcons\"), playing most of\ntheir home games on Sundays. The location will be open when the Falcons have a\n[Monday night](/wiki/Monday_Night_Football \"Monday Night Football\") or\n[Thursday night](/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football \"Thursday Night Football\") home\ngame, as well as non-Sunday home games of [Atlanta United\nFC](/wiki/Atlanta_United_FC \"Atlanta United FC\") and other events at the\nstadium.

Of this, more than $3 million was donated primarily to\nChristian organizations whose agendas included positions that oppose same-sex\nmarriage,[54] with the money donated between 2003 and\n2009.[55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62] A total of $1.9 million was donated in\n2010 to groups such as the Marriage & Family Foundation, [Exodus\nInternational](/wiki/Exodus_International \"Exodus International\"), and the\n[Family Research Council](/wiki/Family_Research_Council \"Family Research\nCouncil\") (FRC).[63] That year, the FRC, which received\n$1,000[55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62] was listed as an anti-gay[64] [hate\ngroup](/wiki/Hate_group \"Hate group\") by the [Southern Poverty Law\nCenter](/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center \"Southern Poverty Law\nCenter\").[65][66][67] WinShape has also contributed to Christian groups\nincluding the [Fellowship of Christian\nAthletes](/wiki/Fellowship_of_Christian_Athletes \"Fellowship of Christian\nAthletes\") and [Exodus International](/wiki/Exodus_International \"Exodus\nInternational\"), the latter is noted for supporting ex-gay [conversion\ntherapy](/wiki/Conversion_therapy \"Conversion therapy\").[63] In response,\nstudents at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the\ncompany's restaurants from their campuses.

Cathy\nmade several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who\n\"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\" were \"inviting God's\njudgment on our nation\".[71][72][73][74][75] Several prominent politicians\nexpressed disapproval.[76] [Boston Mayor](/wiki/Boston_Mayor \"Boston Mayor\")\n[Thomas Menino](/wiki/Thomas_Menino \"Thomas Menino\") and [Chicago\nAlderman](/wiki/Chicago_Alderman \"Chicago Alderman\") [Proco \"Joe\"\nMoreno](/wiki/Proco_Joe_Moreno \"Proco Joe Moreno\") said they hoped to block\nfranchise expansion into their areas.[77][78][79] The proposed bans drew\ncriticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the [American Civil\nLiberties Union](/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union \"American Civil\nLiberties Union\").[80][81][82] The [Jim Henson\nCompany](/wiki/Jim_Henson_Company \"Jim Henson Company\"), which had a\n_[Pajanimals](/wiki/Pajanimals \"Pajanimals\")_ kids' meal toy licensing\narrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship,\nand donate the payment to the [Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against\nDefamation](/wiki/Gay_%26_Lesbian_Alliance_Against_Defamation \"Gay & Lesbian\nAlliance Against Defamation\").[83][84][85] Chick-fil-A stopped distributing\nthe toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the\ncontroversy.[86] Chick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying,\n\"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our\nintent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government\nand political arena.\"[87]\n\n#### Response[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Response\")]\n\nIn response to the controversy, former [Arkansas](/wiki/Arkansas \"Arkansas\")\nGovernor [Mike Huckabee](/wiki/Mike_Huckabee \"Mike Huckabee\") initiated a\nChick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a [boycott](/wiki/Boycott\n\"Boycott\") of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[88][89][90]\nMore than 600,000 people RSVPed on [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\") for\nHuckabee's appreciation event.[89] On August 1, Chick-fil-A restaurants\nexperienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company\nreporting record-breaking sales.[88][89][90] A consulting firm estimated that\nthe average Chick-fil-A restaurant had 29.9 percent more sales and 367 more\ncustomers than it did on a typical Wednesday.[18]\n\n#### Report of policy change[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-\nfil-A&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Report of policy change\")]\n\nIn September 2012, [The Civil Rights Agenda](/wiki/The_Civil_Rights_Agenda\n\"The Civil Rights Agenda\") (TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \"ceased\ndonating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against\nLGBT civil rights.\" Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document\nthat they \"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual\norientation.\"[91] In a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real\nEstate, the company states, \"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much\ncloser look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process\nwill remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with\npolitical agendas.\"[92][93]\n\nAccording to Chicago [Alderman](/wiki/Alderman \"Alderman\") [Proco \"Joe\"\nMoreno](/wiki/Proco_Joe_Moreno \"Proco Joe Moreno\"), Chick-fil-A has a\nstatement of respect for all people regardless of [sexual\norientation](/wiki/Sexual_orientation \"Sexual orientation\") in an internal\ndocument called _Chick-fil-A: Who We Are_. A document released by Chick-fil-A\non September 20, 2012, does not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex\nmarriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will\ncontinue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats\nto strengthen marriages.[94]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Chick-fil-A_-\n_Hillsboro%2C_Oregon.jpg/220px-Chick-fil-A_-\n_Hillsboro%2C_Oregon.jpg)](/wiki/File:Chick-fil-A_-_Hillsboro,_Oregon.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chick-fil-A_-_Hillsboro,_Oregon.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nChick-fil-A in [Hillsboro, Oregon](/wiki/Hillsboro,_Oregon \"Hillsboro,\nOregon\")\n\nAccording to [Focus on the Family](/wiki/Focus_on_the_Family \"Focus on the\nFamily\")'s website, _CitizenLink.com_ , \"Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving\narm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups\nthat support the Biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed\nto open a franchise in Chicago.\"[95] Mike Huckabee stated that he \"talked\nearlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick Fil-A about the new\nreports that Chick Fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same\nsex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair\ntreatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me\nthis statement.\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on\nHuckabee's website.[96][97]\n\n## Recipe changes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Recipe changes\")]\n\nThough Chick-fil-A has always used [trans-fat](/wiki/Trans-fat \"Trans-fat\")\nfree processes in its chicken sandwiches, anticipating the dietary concerns of\nconsumers, in 2008, it became the first fast-food restaurant to become\ncompletely trans-fat free.[98]\n\nIn 2011, food blogger and activist [Vani Hari](/wiki/Vani_Hari \"Vani Hari\")\nwrote a post titled \"Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?\" on her website,\nFoodBabe.com. She noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100\ningredients, including [peanut oil](/wiki/Peanut_oil \"Peanut oil\") with\n[TBHQ](/wiki/TBHQ \"TBHQ\").[99] In October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to\nmeet with company executives at its [Atlanta, GA](/wiki/Atlanta,_GA \"Atlanta,\nGA\") headquarters.[100] In December 2013, Chick-fil-A notified Hari that it\nhad eliminated the [dye Yellow No. 5](/wiki/Tartrazine \"Tartrazine\") and had\nreduced the [sodium](/wiki/Salt \"Salt\") content in its chicken soup. The\ncompany also said that it is testing a peanut oil that does not contain TBHQ\nand that it would start testing sauces and dressings made without [high-\nfructose corn syrup](/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup \"High fructose corn\nsyrup\") in 2014.[100]\n\n## Plan to raise its chickens without\nantibiotics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Plan to raise its chickens without antibiotics\")]\n\nAccording to the [Food and Drug\nAdministration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration \"Food and Drug\nAdministration\"), antibiotics used in livestock, many of which are also used\nto treat humans, have contributed to the rise of dangerous bacteria. In\nDecember 2012, the FDA announced plans to phase out certain antibiotics in the\nfood production industry.[101]\n\nIn February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without\nantibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years. Chick-fil-A is\nthe first quick service restaurant to set forth a plan and commit to serving\nonly poultry raised without antibiotics.[102]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of fast-food chicken restaurants](/wiki/List_of_fast-food_chicken_restaurants \"List of fast-food chicken restaurants\")\n\n  * [![Atlflag.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Atlflag.svg/24px-Atlflag.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Atlflag.svg)[Atlanta portal](/wiki/Portal:Atlanta \"Portal:Atlanta\")\n  * [![Emblem-money.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/21px-Emblem-money.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Emblem-money.svg)[Business and economics portal](/wiki/Portal:Business_and_economics \"Portal:Business and economics\")\n  * [![Industry5.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Industry5.svg/21px-Industry5.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Industry5.svg)[Companies portal](/wiki/Portal:Companies \"Portal:Companies\")\n  * [![Foodlogo2.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg/24px-Foodlogo2.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Foodlogo2.svg)[Food portal](/wiki/Portal:Food \"Portal:Food\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chick-fil-A&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Company Fact Sheet\"](http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Company/Highlights-Fact-Sheets). _Chick-fil-A_.\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Press Room\"](https://thechickenwire.chick-fil-a.com/Press-Room). _Chick-fil-A_.
