Chelsea beat Arsenal by three goals to one, a result which\nmoved them 12 points clear in first position.[23] The win was significant\ngiven Chelsea lost the reverse fixture 3–0 in September 2016, a \"watershed\nmoment\" in their season according to BBC journalist [Phil\nMcNulty](/wiki/Phil_McNulty \"Phil McNulty\").[24] While Arsenal struggled to\nbuild momentum throughout autumn and winter, Chelsea manager [Antonio\nConte](/wiki/Antonio_Conte \"Antonio Conte\")'s tactical switch from\n[4–3–3](/wiki/Formation_\\(association_football\\)#4.E2.80.933.E2.80.933\n\"Formation \\(association football\\)\") to\n[3–4–3](/wiki/Formation_\\(association_football\\)#3.E2.80.934.E2.80.933\n\"Formation \\(association football\\)\") thereafter resulted in a 13-match\nwinning run.[25][26] They won the Premier League with two matches to\nspare,[26] and later set a new divisional record for the most wins (30).[27]\nArsenal ended the season in fifth place, their lowest placing under manager\n[Arsène Wenger](/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Wenger \"Arsène Wenger\"), and missed out on\n[UEFA Champions League](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League \"UEFA Champions League\")\nfootball for the first time in 20 years.[28] Wenger's future had been cast\ninto doubt following a bad run of form in February and March, which saw the\nteam lose 10–2 on aggregate against [Bayern Munich](/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich \"FC\nBayern Munich\") in the Champions League, and four of their five league\nmatches.[29] To arrest the decline, Wenger adopted a similar tactical change\nto Conte, playing three defenders at the back.[30] Arsenal went on to win\neight of their last nine fixtures, but Wenger admitted his team were\n[outsiders](/wiki/Underdog_\\(term\\) \"Underdog \\(term\\)\") for the final: \"This\ntime we are not favourites, it’s quite even or maybe Chelsea are ahead, so\nit’s a bit similar to what happened in the semi-final against Manchester City.\nThat’s part of what makes it all exciting as well.\"[31] Of his future he said,\n\"It will not be my last match anyway, because I will stay, no matter what\nhappens, in football.\"[32]\n\n\"Mertesacker is going to be crucial for Arsenal if he plays; he will have to\nplay very well if Arsenal are to have any chance. If he doesn't play well then\nChelsea are going to cut through Arsenal like a knife through butter.\"\n\n[Paul Merson](/wiki/Paul_Merson \"Paul Merson\")'s pre-match assessment[33]\n\nConte described Wenger as one of the greats in football, and felt he would\nremain as Arsenal manager come the season's end.[34] \"He has done a fantastic\njob. Sometimes in England I think you undervalue the achievement of qualifying\nfor the Champions League. Only this season they haven't qualified for the\nChampions League,\" he continued.[34] Conte reiterated the importance of his\nplayers keeping their focus and wanted Chelsea to \"pay great attention and\nfocus\" to their opponents.[35] Hazard, who was playing in his first FA Cup\nfinal, was eager to win the competition: \"For Chelsea, for such a big club\nlike this, you need to win one, two, three trophies every season if you can.\nNow we have the possibility to win another trophy so all the players are ready\nfor that. It's such a great competition for the fans.\"[34]\n\nChelsea and Arsenal were expected to line up in a 3–4–3 formation.[36] Whereas\nthe former club had no injury or suspension worries, Arsenal had doubts over\nthe fitness of [Petr Čech](/wiki/Petr_%C4%8Cech \"Petr Čech\") and [Shkodran\nMustafi](/wiki/Shkodran_Mustafi \"Shkodran Mustafi\"), and were already without\ndefenders [Laurent Koscielny](/wiki/Laurent_Koscielny \"Laurent Koscielny\")\n(suspension) and Gabriel (ankle injury).[36] [Per\nMertesacker](/wiki/Per_Mertesacker \"Per Mertesacker\") was expected to start;\nthe [Germany international](/wiki/Germany_national_football_team \"Germany\nnational football team\") only featured once for Arsenal's first team during\nthe season.[37] The day before the final _[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian\n\"The Guardian\")_ reported that Wenger chose [David Ospina](/wiki/David_Ospina\n\"David Ospina\") to start in goal ahead of Čech.[38]\n\nBoth clubs received an allocation of approximately 28,000 tickets.[39] For\nadults, these were priced £45, £65, £85 and £115, with concessions in\nplace.[39] Chelsea supporters were situated in the west side of the ground,\nwhile Arsenal's were allocated in the east.[40] The remaining 14,000 tickets\nwere distributed to volunteers involved in the FA's work.[39] Finalists stood\nto receive £900,000 minimum, the winners earned £1.8 million.[41] Security at\nWembley Stadium was tightened in the wake of the [Manchester Arena\nbombing](/wiki/Manchester_Arena_bombing \"Manchester Arena bombing\"); as a\nsecurity measure Arsenal cancelled a screening of the game at their\nground.[42] Both clubs cancelled plans for [open top bus](/wiki/Open_top_bus\n\"Open top bus\") victory parades.[43]\n\n[Sol Campbell](/wiki/Sol_Campbell \"Sol Campbell\") and [Eddie\nNewton](/wiki/Eddie_Newton \"Eddie Newton\") came onto the pitch to greet the\nsupporters and place the trophy on a plinth.[44] As they departed, the\ntraditional Cup Final hymn, \"[Abide with Me](/wiki/Abide_with_Me \"Abide with\nMe\")\" was sung by representatives of eight clubs, including [Lincoln\nCity](/wiki/Lincoln_City_F.C. \"Lincoln City F.C.\"),\n[Guernsey](/wiki/Guernsey_F.C. \"Guernsey F.C.\"),\n[Millwall](/wiki/Millwall_F.C. \"Millwall F.C.\") and Sutton United.[45] The\nteams emerged moments later led by their managers, and players were greeted by\n[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge](/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge\n\"Prince William, Duke of Cambridge\").
