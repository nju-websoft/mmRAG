Twenty-four pitchers have reached this milestone. The New York\nGothams/Giants/San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to see three\nplayers reach the milestone while on their roster: those players are [Mickey\nWelch](/wiki/Mickey_Welch \"Mickey Welch\"), [Christy\nMathewson](/wiki/Christy_Mathewson \"Christy Mathewson\"), and [Randy\nJohnson](/wiki/Randy_Johnson \"Randy Johnson\"). Early in the history of\nprofessional baseball, many of the rules favored the pitcher over the batter;\nthe distance pitchers threw to home plate was shorter than today, and pitchers\nwere able to use foreign substances to alter the direction of the ball.[1] The\nfirst player to win 300 games was [Pud Galvin](/wiki/Pud_Galvin \"Pud Galvin\")\nin 1888. Seven pitchers recorded all or the majority of their career wins in\nthe 19th century: Galvin, [Cy Young](/wiki/Cy_Young \"Cy Young\"), [Kid\nNichols](/wiki/Kid_Nichols \"Kid Nichols\"), [Tim Keefe](/wiki/Tim_Keefe \"Tim\nKeefe\"), [John Clarkson](/wiki/John_Clarkson \"John Clarkson\"), [Charley\nRadbourn](/wiki/Charley_Radbourn \"Charley Radbourn\"), and [Mickey\nWelch](/wiki/Mickey_Welch \"Mickey Welch\").[2] Four more pitchers joined the\nclub in the first quarter of the 20th century: [Christy\nMathewson](/wiki/Christy_Mathewson \"Christy Mathewson\"), [Walter\nJohnson](/wiki/Walter_Johnson \"Walter Johnson\"), [Eddie\nPlank](/wiki/Eddie_Plank \"Eddie Plank\"), and [Grover Cleveland\nAlexander](/wiki/Grover_Cleveland_Alexander \"Grover Cleveland Alexander\").[1]\nYoung is the all-time leader in wins with 511, a mark that is considered\n[unbreakable](/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_records_considered_unbreakable\n\"List of Major League Baseball records considered unbreakable\").[3] If a\nmodern-day pitcher won 20 games per season for 25 seasons, he would still be\n11 games short of Young's mark.\n\nOnly three pitchers, [Lefty Grove](/wiki/Lefty_Grove \"Lefty Grove\"), [Warren\nSpahn](/wiki/Warren_Spahn \"Warren Spahn\"), and [Early Wynn](/wiki/Early_Wynn\n\"Early Wynn\"), joined the 300 win club between 1924 and 1982, which may be\nexplained by a number of factors: the abolition of the\n[spitball](/wiki/Spitball \"Spitball\"),[1][a] [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II\n\"World War II\") military service, such as [Bob Feller](/wiki/Bob_Feller \"Bob\nFeller\")'s,[5] and the growing importance of the [home run](/wiki/Home_run\n\"Home run\") in the game.[1] As the home run became commonplace, the physical\nand mental demands on pitchers dramatically increased, which led to the use of\na four-man starting rotation.[1][2] Between 1982 and 1990, the 300 win club\ngained six members: [Gaylord Perry](/wiki/Gaylord_Perry \"Gaylord Perry\"),\n[Phil Niekro](/wiki/Phil_Niekro \"Phil Niekro\"), [Steve\nCarlton](/wiki/Steve_Carlton \"Steve Carlton\"), [Nolan Ryan](/wiki/Nolan_Ryan\n\"Nolan Ryan\"), [Don Sutton](/wiki/Don_Sutton \"Don Sutton\") and [Tom\nSeaver](/wiki/Tom_Seaver \"Tom Seaver\").[2] These pitchers benefited from the\nincreased use of specialized [relief pitchers](/wiki/Relief_pitchers \"Relief\npitchers\"), an expanded [strike zone](/wiki/Strike_zone \"Strike zone\"), and\nnew stadiums, including [Shea Stadium](/wiki/Shea_Stadium \"Shea Stadium\"),\n[Dodger Stadium](/wiki/Dodger_Stadium \"Dodger Stadium\") and the\n[Astrodome](/wiki/Astrodome \"Astrodome\"), that were [pitcher's\nparks](/wiki/Pitcher%27s_park \"Pitcher's park\"), which suppressed offensive\nproduction.[2] Also, the increasing sophistication of training methods and\nsports medicine, such as [Tommy John surgery](/wiki/Tommy_John_surgery \"Tommy\nJohn surgery\"), allowed players to maintain a high competitive level for a\nlonger time.[6] [Randy Johnson](/wiki/Randy_Johnson \"Randy Johnson\"), for\nexample, won more games in his 40s than he did in his 20s.[7]\n\nSince 1990, only four pitchers have joined the 300 win club: [Roger\nClemens](/wiki/Roger_Clemens \"Roger Clemens\"), [Greg Maddux](/wiki/Greg_Maddux\n\"Greg Maddux\"), [Tom Glavine](/wiki/Tom_Glavine \"Tom Glavine\"), and Johnson.\nChanges in the game in the last decade of the 20th century have made attaining\n300 career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20th\ncentury.[8] The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man\nrotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins.[2] No\npitcher reached 20 wins in a non strike-shortened year for the first time in\n2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.[9]\n\nRecording 300 career wins has been seen as a guaranteed admission to the\n[Baseball Hall of Fame](/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum\n\"National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\").[10][11][12] All pitchers with\n300 wins have been elected to the Hall of Fame[13] except for Clemens, who\nreceived only half of the vote total needed for induction in his first\nappearance on the Hall of Fame ballot in\n[2013](/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_balloting,_2013 \"Baseball Hall of Fame\nballoting, 2013\")[14] and lost votes from that total in\n[2014](/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_balloting,_2014 \"Baseball Hall of Fame\nballoting, 2014\").[15] Clemens' future election is seen as uncertain because\nof his alleged links to [use of performance-enhancing\ndrugs](/wiki/Doping_in_baseball \"Doping in baseball\").[16] To be eligible for\nthe Hall of Fame, a player must have \"been retired five seasons\" or deceased\nfor at least six months,[17] Many observers expect the club to gain few, if\nany, members in the foreseeable future.[13][18][19] Ten members of the 300 win\nclub are also members of the [3,000 strikeout club](/wiki/3,000_strikeout_club\n\"3,000 strikeout club\").[20]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Members\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 Notes\n  * 4 References\n\n##
