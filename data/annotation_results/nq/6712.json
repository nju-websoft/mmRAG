[e](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Constitutional_history_of_Canada&action=edit)\n\n  \n  \nThe **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**\n([French](/wiki/French_language \"French language\"): _La Charte canadienne des\ndroits et libertés_), in Canada often simply the **Charter** , is a [bill of\nrights](/wiki/Bill_of_rights \"Bill of rights\") entrenched in the [Constitution\nof Canada](/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada \"Constitution of Canada\"). It forms\nthe first part of the [Constitution Act, 1982](/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1982\n\"Constitution Act, 1982\"). The Charter guarantees certain\n[political](/wiki/Politics_of_Canada \"Politics of Canada\") rights to Canadian\ncitizens and [civil rights](/wiki/Civil_rights \"Civil rights\") of everyone in\n[Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") from the policies and actions of all areas and\nlevels of the [government](/wiki/Government_of_Canada \"Government of Canada\").\nIt is designed to unify [Canadians](/wiki/Canadians \"Canadians\") around a set\nof principles that embody those rights. The Charter was signed into law by\n[Queen Elizabeth II of Canada](/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada \"Monarchy of Canada\")\non April 17, 1982, along with the rest of the Act.\n\nThe Charter was preceded by the [Canadian Bill of\nRights](/wiki/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights \"Canadian Bill of Rights\"), which was\nenacted in 1960. However, the Bill of Rights is only a federal\n[statute](/wiki/Statute \"Statute\"), rather than a constitutional document. As\na federal statute, it can be amended through the ordinary legislative process\nand has no application to provincial laws. The Supreme Court of Canada also\nnarrowly interpreted the Bill of Rights and the Court was reluctant to declare\nlaws inoperative.[1] The relative ineffectiveness of the Canadian Bill of\nRights motivated many to improve rights protections in Canada. The movement\nfor [human rights](/wiki/Human_right \"Human right\") and freedoms that emerged\nafter [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") also wanted to\nentrench the principles enunciated in the [Universal Declaration of Human\nRights](/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights \"Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights\").[2] The British Parliament formally enacted the Charter as a\npart of the [Canada Act 1982](/wiki/Canada_Act_1982 \"Canada Act 1982\") at the\nrequest of the [Parliament of Canada](/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada \"Parliament\nof Canada\") in 1982, the result of the efforts of the government of [Prime\nMinister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada \"Prime Minister of Canada\") [Pierre\nTrudeau](/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau \"Pierre Trudeau\").\n\nOne of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly\nexpand the scope of [judicial review](/wiki/Judicial_review \"Judicial\nreview\"), because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee\nof rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Bill of\nRights. The [courts](/wiki/Court_system_of_Canada \"Court system of Canada\"),\nwhen confronted with violations of Charter rights, have struck down\nunconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of\nstatutes and regulations, as they did when [Canadian case\nlaw](/wiki/Law_of_Canada \"Law of Canada\") was primarily concerned with\nresolving issues of [federalism](/wiki/Canadian_federalism \"Canadian\nfederalism\"). The Charter, however, granted new powers to the courts to\nenforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in\ntrials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the [common\nlaw](/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\") and under a system of government that,\ninfluenced by Canada's parent country the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"), was based upon [Parliamentary\nsupremacy](/wiki/Parliamentary_supremacy \"Parliamentary supremacy\"). As a\nresult, the Charter has attracted both broad support from a majority of the\nCanadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased [judicial\npower](/wiki/Judicial_power \"Judicial power\"). The Charter only applies to\ngovernment laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal,\nprovincial, and municipal governments and public school boards), and sometimes\nto the common law, not to private activity.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Features\n    * 1.1 Exceptions\n    * 1.2 Fundamental freedoms\n    * 1.3 Democratic rights\n    * 1.4 Mobility rights\n    * 1.5 Legal

[e](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Canadian_Charter&action=edit)\n\n  \n  \nUnder the Charter, people physically present in Canada have numerous civil and\npolitical rights. Most of the rights can be exercised by any legal person (the\nCharter does not define the corporation as a \"legal person\"),[3] but a few of\nthe rights belong exclusively to natural persons, or (as in sections 3 and 6)\nonly to [citizens of Canada](/wiki/Canadian_nationality_law \"Canadian\nnationality law\"). The rights are enforceable by the courts through [section\n24](/wiki/Section_Twenty-four_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms\n\"Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\") of the\nCharter, which allows courts discretion to award remedies to those whose\nrights have been denied. This section also allows courts to exclude evidence\nin trials if the evidence was acquired in a way that conflicts with the\nCharter and might damage the reputation of the justice system. [Section\n32](/wiki/Section_Thirty-two_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms\n\"Section Thirty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\") confirms\nthat the Charter is binding on the federal government, the territories under\nits authority, and the provincial governments. The rights and freedoms\nenshrined in 34 sections of the Charter include:\n\n###\nExceptions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Exceptions\")]\n\nPrecluding all the freedoms and forming the basis of the Charter, the [very\nfirst\nsection](/wiki/Section_One_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms\n\"Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\"), known as\n_limitations clause_ , allows governments to justify certain infringements of\nCharter rights. Every case in which a court discovers a violation of the\nCharter would therefore require a section 1 analysis to determine if the law\ncan still be upheld. Infringements are upheld if the purpose for the\ngovernment action is to achieve what would be recognized as an urgent or\nimportant objective in a free society, and if the infringement can be\n\"demonstrably justified.\" Section 1 has thus been used to uphold laws against\nobjectionable conduct such as [hate speech](/wiki/Hate_speech \"Hate speech\")\n(e.g., in _[R. v. Keegstra](/wiki/R._v._Keegstra \"R. v. Keegstra\")_) and\n[obscenity](/wiki/Obscenity \"Obscenity\") (e.g., in _[R. v.\nButler](/wiki/R._v._Butler \"R. v. Butler\")_). Section 1 also confirms that the\nrights listed in the Charter are guaranteed.\n\nIn addition, some of these rights are also subjected to the _notwithstanding\nclause_ ([section 33](/wiki/Section_Thirty-\nthree_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms \"Section Thirty-three of\nthe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\")). The notwithstanding clause\nauthorizes governments to temporarily override the rights and freedoms in\nsections 2 and 7–15 for up to five years, subject to renewal. The Canadian\nfederal government has never invoked it, and some have speculated that its use\nwould be politically costly.[4] In the past, the notwithstanding clause was\ninvoked routinely by the province of [Quebec](/wiki/Quebec \"Quebec\") (which\ndid not support the enactment of the Charter but is subject to it\nnonetheless). The provinces of [Saskatchewan](/wiki/Saskatchewan\n\"Saskatchewan\") and [Alberta](/wiki/Alberta \"Alberta\") have also invoked the\nnotwithstanding clause, to end a [strike](/wiki/Strike_action \"Strike action\")\nand to protect an exclusively [heterosexual definition](/wiki/Same-\nsex_marriage_in_Canada \"Same-sex marriage in Canada\") of marriage,[5]\nrespectively. (Note that Alberta's use of the notwithstanding clause is of no\nforce or effect, since the definition of marriage is federal not provincial\njurisdiction.)[6] The territory of Yukon also passed legislation once that\ninvoked the notwithstanding clause, but the legislation was never proclaimed\nin force.[7]\n\n### Fundamental\nfreedoms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Fundamental freedoms\")]\n\n    \n\n    [Section 2:](/wiki/Section_Two_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms \"Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\") which lists what the Charter calls \"fundamental freedoms\" namely [freedom of conscience](/wiki/Freedom_of_conscience \"Freedom of conscience\"), [freedom of religion](/wiki/Freedom_of_religion \"Freedom of religion\"), [freedom of thought](/wiki/Freedom_of_thought \"Freedom of thought\"), [freedom of belief](/wiki/Freedom_of_belief \"Freedom of belief\"), [freedom of expression](/wiki/Freedom_of_expression \"Freedom of expression\"), [freedom of the press](/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press \"Freedom of the press\") and of other media of communication, [freedom of peaceful assembly](/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly \"Freedom of assembly\"), and [freedom of association](/wiki/Freedom_of_association \"Freedom of association\").\n\n### Democratic\nrights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Democratic rights\")]\n\nGenerally, the right to participate in political activities and the right to a\n[democratic](/wiki/Democracy \"Democracy\") form of government are protected:\n\n    \n\n    [Section 3:](/wiki/Section_Three_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms \"Section Three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\") the right to [vote](/wiki/Voting \"Voting\") and to be eligible to serve as member of a [legislature](/wiki/Legislative_Assemblies_of_Canada%27s_provinces_and_territories \"Legislative Assemblies of Canada's provinces and territories\").\n    [Section 4:](/wiki/Section_Four_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms \"Section Four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\") the maximum duration of legislatures is set at five years.\n    [Section 5:](/wiki/Section_Five_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms \"Section Five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\") an annual sitting of legislatures is required as a minimum.\n\n### Mobility\nrights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Mobility rights\")]\n\n    \n\n    [Section 6](/wiki/Section_Six_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms \"Section Six of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\"): protects the mobility rights of Canadian citizens which include the right to enter, remain in, and leave Canada.

Many of these\nrights were also included in the [Canadian Bill of\nRights](/wiki/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights \"Canadian Bill of Rights\"), which the\n[Canadian Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada \"Parliament of Canada\")\nenacted in 1960. However, the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of\nshortcomings. Unlike the Charter, it was an ordinary Act of Parliament, which\ncould be amended by a simple majority of Parliament, and it was applicable\nonly to the federal government. The courts also chose to interpret the Bill of\nRights conservatively, only on rare occasions applying it to find a contrary\nlaw inoperative. The Bill of Rights did not contain all of the rights that are\nnow included in the Charter, omitting, for instance, the [right to\nvote](/wiki/Suffrage \"Suffrage\")[10] and [freedom of\nmovement](/wiki/Freedom_of_movement \"Freedom of movement\") within Canada.[11]\n\nThe centennial of [Canadian Confederation](/wiki/Canadian_Confederation\n\"Canadian Confederation\") in 1967 aroused greater interest within the\ngovernment in constitutional reform. Said reforms would include improving\nsafeguards of rights, as well as [patriation](/wiki/Patriation \"Patriation\")\nof the Constitution, meaning the [British\nParliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Parliament of the United\nKingdom\") would no longer have to approve [constitutional\namendments](/wiki/Constitutional_amendment \"Constitutional amendment\").\nSubsequently, [Attorney General](/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Canada \"Attorney\nGeneral of Canada\") [Pierre Trudeau](/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau \"Pierre Trudeau\")\nappointed law professor [Barry Strayer](/wiki/Barry_Strayer \"Barry Strayer\")\nto research a potential bill of rights. While writing his report, Strayer\nconsulted with a number of notable legal scholars, including [Walter\nTarnopolsky](/wiki/Walter_Tarnopolsky \"Walter Tarnopolsky\"). Strayer's report\nadvocated a number of ideas that were later incorporated into the Charter,\nincluding protection for language rights. Strayer also advocated excluding\neconomic rights. Finally, he recommended allowing for limits on rights. Such\nlimits are included in the Charter's limitation and notwithstanding\nclauses.[12] In 1968, Strayer was made the Director of the Constitutional Law\nDivision of the Privy Council Office and in 1974 he became Assistant Deputy\nMinister of Justice. During those years, Strayer played a role in writing the\nbill that was ultimately adopted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trudeau, who had become [Liberal](/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada\n\"Liberal Party of Canada\") leader and prime minister in 1968, still very much\nwanted a constitutional bill of rights. The federal government and the\n[provinces](/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada \"Provinces and\nterritories of Canada\") discussed creating one during negotiations for\npatriation, which resulted in the [Victoria Charter](/wiki/Victoria_Charter\n\"Victoria Charter\") in 1971. This never came to be implemented. However,\nTrudeau continued with his efforts to patriate the Constitution, and promised\nconstitutional change during the [1980 Quebec\nreferendum](/wiki/1980_Quebec_referendum \"1980 Quebec referendum\"). He would\nsucceed in 1982 with the passage of the [Canada Act\n1982](/wiki/Canada_Act_1982 \"Canada Act 1982\"). This enacted the Constitution\nAct, 1982.\n\nThe inclusion of a charter of rights in the Constitution Act was a much-\ndebated issue. Trudeau spoke on television in October 1980,[13] and announced\nhis intention to constitutionalize a bill of rights that would include\nfundamental freedoms, democratic guarantees, freedom of movement, legal\nrights, [equality](/wiki/Social_equality \"Social equality\") and language\nrights.[14] He did not want a notwithstanding clause. While his proposal\ngained popular support,[15] provincial leaders opposed the potential limits on\ntheir powers. The federal [Progressive\nConservative](/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada \"Progressive\nConservative Party of Canada\") opposition feared liberal bias among judges,\nshould courts be called upon to enforce rights.[16] Additionally, the British\nParliament cited their right to uphold Canada's old form of government.[17] At\na suggestion of the Conservatives, Trudeau's government thus agreed to a\ncommittee of [Senators](/wiki/Canadian_Senate \"Canadian Senate\") and MPs to\nfurther examine the bill of rights as well as the patriation plan. During this\ntime, 90 hours were spent on the bill of rights alone, all filmed for\ntelevision,[15] while civil rights experts and [advocacy\ngroups](/wiki/Advocacy_group \"Advocacy group\") put forward their perceptions\non the Charter's flaws and omissions and how to remedy them.[15] As Canada had\na parliamentary system of government, and as judges were perceived not to have\nenforced rights well in the past, it was questioned whether the courts should\nbe named as the enforcers of the Charter, as Trudeau wanted. Conservatives\nargued that elected politicians should be trusted instead. It was eventually\ndecided that the responsibility should go to the courts. At the urging of\n[civil libertarians](/wiki/Civil_libertarian \"Civil libertarian\"), judges\ncould even now exclude evidence in trials if acquired in breach of Charter\nrights in certain circumstances, something the Charter was not originally\ngoing to provide for. As the process continued, more features were added to\nthe Charter, including equality rights for people with disabilities, more sex\nequality guarantees and recognition of Canada's\n[multiculturalism](/wiki/Multiculturalism \"Multiculturalism\"). The limitations\nclause was also reworded to focus less on the importance of parliamentary\ngovernment and more on justifiability of limits in free societies; the latter\nlogic was more in line with rights developments around the world after World\nWar II.[18]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Pierre_Elliot_Trudeau-2.jpg/220px-\nPierre_Elliot_Trudeau-2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pierre_Elliot_Trudeau-2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pierre_Elliot_Trudeau-2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada \"Prime Minister of Canada\")\n[Pierre Trudeau](/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau \"Pierre Trudeau\") was a major advocate\nof the Charter.\n\nIn its decision in the _[Patriation Reference](/wiki/Patriation_Reference\n\"Patriation Reference\")_ (1981), the [Supreme Court of\nCanada](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada \"Supreme Court of Canada\") had ruled\nthere was a tradition that some provincial approval should be sought for\nconstitutional reform. As the provinces still had doubts about the Charter's\nmerits, Trudeau was forced to accept the notwithstanding clause to allow\ngovernments to opt out of certain obligations. The notwithstanding clause was\naccepted as part of a deal called the Kitchen Accord, negotiated by the\nfederal Attorney General [Jean Chrétien](/wiki/Jean_Chr%C3%A9tien \"Jean\nChrétien\"), Ontario's justice minister [Roy McMurtry](/wiki/Roy_McMurtry \"Roy\nMcMurtry\") and Saskatchewan's justice minister [Roy Romanow](/wiki/Roy_Romanow\n\"Roy Romanow\"). Pressure from provincial governments (which in Canada have\njurisdiction over property) and from the country's [left wing](/wiki/Left-\nwing_politics \"Left-wing politics\"), especially the [New Democratic\nParty](/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_\\(Canada\\) \"New Democratic Party\n\\(Canada\\)\"), also prevented Trudeau from including any rights protecting\nprivate property.[19]\n\nNevertheless, Quebec did not support the Charter (or the Canada Act 1982),\nwith \"conflicting interpretations\" as to why. The opposition could have owed\nto the _[Parti Québécois](/wiki/Parti_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois \"Parti Québécois\")_\nleadership being allegedly uncooperative, because it was more committed to\ngaining sovereignty for Quebec. It could have owed to Quebec leaders being\nexcluded from the negotiation of the [Kitchen Accord](/wiki/Kitchen_Accord\n\"Kitchen Accord\"), which they saw as being too centralist. It could have owed\nto provincial leaders' objections to the Accord's provisions relating to the\nprocess of future constitutional amendment.[20] They also opposed the\ninclusion of mobility rights and minority language education rights.[21] The\nCharter is still applicable in Quebec because all provinces are bound by the\nConstitution. However, Quebec's opposition to the 1982 patriation package has\nled to two failed attempts to amend the Constitution (the [Meech Lake\nAccord](/wiki/Meech_Lake_Accord \"Meech Lake Accord\") and [Charlottetown\nAccord](/wiki/Charlottetown_Accord \"Charlottetown Accord\")) which were\ndesigned primarily to obtain Quebec's political approval of the Canadian\nconstitutional order.\n\nWhile the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was adopted in 1982, it was\nnot until 1985 that the main provisions regarding equality rights (section 15)\ncame into effect. The delay was meant to give the federal and provincial\ngovernments an opportunity to review pre-existing statutes and strike\npotentially unconstitutional inequalities.\n\nThe typography of the physical document pictured here, and still distributed\ntoday, was typeset by Ottawa's [David\nBerman](/wiki/David_Berman_\\(graphic_designer\\) \"David Berman \\(graphic\ndesigner\\)\") intentionally in Carl Dair's [Cartier](/wiki/Cartier_\\(typeface\\)\n\"Cartier \\(typeface\\)\") typeface: at the time the most prominent Canadian\ntypeface, having been commissioned by the Governor-General as a celebration of\nCanada's centenary in 1967.\n\nThe Charter has been amended since its enactment. Section 25 was amended in\n1983 to explicitly recognize more rights regarding [Aboriginal land\nclaims](/wiki/Aboriginal_land_claims \"Aboriginal land claims\"), and section\n16.1 was added in 1993. There have also been a number of [unsuccessful\nattempts to amend the\nCharter](/wiki/Unsuccessful_attempts_to_amend_the_Canadian_Constitution\n\"Unsuccessful attempts to amend the Canadian Constitution\"), including the\nfailed [Charlottetown Accord](/wiki/Charlottetown_Accord \"Charlottetown\nAccord\") of 1992. The Charlottetown Accord would have specifically required\nthe Charter to be interpreted in a manner respectful of Quebec's [distinct\nsociety](/wiki/Distinct_society \"Distinct society\"), and would have added\nfurther statements to the [Constitution Act,\n1867](/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1867 \"Constitution Act, 1867\") regarding racial\nand sexual equality and collective rights, and about [minority\nlanguage](/wiki/Minority_language \"Minority language\") communities. Though the\nAccord was negotiated among many interest groups, the resulting provisions\nwere so vague that Trudeau, then out of office, feared they would actually\nconflict with and undermine the Charter's individual rights. He felt judicial\nreview of the rights might be undermined if courts had to favour the policies\nof provincial governments, as governments would be given responsibility over\nlinguistic minorities. Trudeau thus played a prominent role in leading the\npopular opposition to the Accord.[22]\n\n## Interpretation and\nenforcement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Interpretation and enforcement\")]\n\nThe task of interpreting and enforcing the Charter falls to the courts, with\nthe Supreme Court of Canada being the ultimate authority on the matter.\n\nWith the Charter's supremacy confirmed by section 52 of the Constitution Act,\n1982, the courts continued their practice of striking down unconstitutional\nstatutes or parts of statutes as they had with earlier case law regarding\nfederalism. However, under section 24 of the Charter, courts also gained new\npowers to enforce creative remedies and exclude more evidence in trials.\nCourts have since made many important decisions, including _[R. v.\nMorgentaler](/wiki/R._v._Morgentaler \"R. v. Morgentaler\")_ (1988), which\nstruck down [Canada's abortion law](/wiki/Abortion_in_Canada \"Abortion in\nCanada\"), and _[Vriend v. Alberta](/wiki/Vriend_v._Alberta \"Vriend v.\nAlberta\")_ (1998), in which the Supreme Court found the province's exclusion\nof [homosexuals](/wiki/Homosexuality \"Homosexuality\") from protection against\ndiscrimination violated section 15. In the latter case, the Court then read\nthe protection into the law.\n\nCourts may receive Charter questions in a number of ways. Rights claimants\ncould be prosecuted under a [criminal law](/wiki/Criminal_law_in_Canada\n\"Criminal law in Canada\") that they argue is unconstitutional. Others may feel\ngovernment services and policies are not being dispensed in accordance with\nthe Charter, and apply to lower-level courts for injunctions against the\ngovernment (as was the case in _[Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of\nEducation)](/wiki/Doucet-Boudreau_v._Nova_Scotia_\\(Minister_of_Education\\)\n\"Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia \\(Minister of Education\\)\")_). A government\nmay also raise questions of rights by submitting [reference\nquestions](/wiki/Reference_question \"Reference question\") to higher-level\ncourts; for example, Prime Minister [Paul Martin](/wiki/Paul_Martin \"Paul\nMartin\")'s government approached the Supreme Court with Charter questions as\nwell as federalism concerns in the case _[Re Same-Sex Marriage](/wiki/Re_Same-\nSex_Marriage \"Re Same-Sex Marriage\")_ (2004). Provinces may also do this with\ntheir superior courts. The government of [Prince Edward\nIsland](/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island \"Prince Edward Island\") initiated the\n_[Provincial Judges Reference](/wiki/Provincial_Judges_Reference \"Provincial\nJudges Reference\")_ by asking its [provincial Supreme Court](/wiki/PESCAD\n\"PESCAD\") a question on [judicial independence](/wiki/Judicial_independence\n\"Judicial independence\") under section 11.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Ottawa_-_ON_-\n_Oberster_Gerichtshof_von_Kanada.jpg/250px-Ottawa_-_ON_-\n_Oberster_Gerichtshof_von_Kanada.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ottawa_-_ON_-\n_Oberster_Gerichtshof_von_Kanada.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ottawa_-_ON_-_Oberster_Gerichtshof_von_Kanada.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe building of the [Supreme Court of Canada](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada\n\"Supreme Court of Canada\"), the chief authority on the interpretation of the\nCharter\n\nIn several important cases, judges developed various tests and precedents for\ninterpreting specific provisions of the Charter. These include the _Oakes\ntest_ for section 1, set out in the case _[R. v. Oakes](/wiki/R._v._Oakes \"R.\nv. Oakes\")_ (1986), and the (now defunct[23]) _Law test_ for section 15,\ndeveloped in _[Law v. Canada](/wiki/Law_v._Canada \"Law v. Canada\")_ (1999).\nSince _[Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act](/wiki/Re_B.C._Motor_Vehicle_Act \"Re B.C.\nMotor Vehicle Act\")_ (1985), various approaches to defining and expanding the\nscope of [fundamental justice](/wiki/Fundamental_justice \"Fundamental\njustice\") (the Canadian name for [natural justice](/wiki/Natural_justice\n\"Natural justice\") or [due process](/wiki/Due_process \"Due process\")) under\nsection 7 have been adopted. (_For more information, see the[articles on each\nCharter section](/wiki/Category:Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms\n\"Category:Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\")_).\n\nIn general, courts have embraced a _[purposive\ninterpretation](/wiki/Purposive_interpretation \"Purposive interpretation\")_ of\nCharter rights.[24] This means that since early cases like _[Hunter v.\nSoutham](/wiki/Hunter_v._Southam \"Hunter v. Southam\")_ (1984) and _[R. v. Big\nM Drug Mart](/wiki/R._v._Big_M_Drug_Mart \"R. v. Big M Drug Mart\")_ (1985),\nthey have concentrated not on the traditional, limited understanding of what\neach right meant when the Charter was adopted in 1982, but rather on changing\nthe scope of rights as appropriate to fit their broader purpose.[24] This is\ntied to the _generous interpretation_ of rights, as the purpose of the Charter\nprovisions is assumed to be to increase rights and freedoms of people in a\nvariety of circumstances, at the expense of the government powers.[24]\nConstitutional scholar [Peter Hogg](/wiki/Peter_Hogg \"Peter Hogg\") has\napproved of the generous approach in some cases, although for others he argues\nthe purpose of the provisions was not to achieve a set of rights as broad as\ncourts have imagined.[24] Indeed, this approach has not been without its\ncritics. Alberta politician [Ted Morton](/wiki/Ted_Morton \"Ted Morton\") and\npolitical scientist [Rainer Knopff](/wiki/Rainer_Knopff \"Rainer Knopff\") have\nbeen very critical of this phenomenon. Although they feel the basis for the\napproach, the [living tree doctrine](/wiki/Living_tree_doctrine \"Living tree\ndoctrine\") (the classical name for generous interpretations of the Canadian\nConstitution), is sound, they argue Charter case law has been more radical.\nWhen the living tree doctrine is applied right, the authors claim, \"The elm\nremained an elm; it grew new branches but did not transform itself into an oak\nor a willow.\" The doctrine can be used, for example, so a right is upheld even\nwhen a government threatens to violate it with new technology, as long as the\nessential right remains the same; but the authors claim that the courts have\nused the doctrine to \"create new rights.\" As an example, the authors note that\nthe Charter right against [self-incrimination](/wiki/Self-incrimination \"Self-\nincrimination\") has been extended to cover scenarios in the justice system\nthat had previously been unregulated by self-incrimination rights in other\nCanadian laws.[25]\n\nAnother general approach to interpreting Charter rights is to consider\ninternational legal precedents with countries that have specific rights\nprotections, such as the [United States Bill of\nRights](/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights \"United States Bill of Rights\") (an\ninfluence on aspects of the Charter) and the [Constitution of South\nAfrica](/wiki/Constitution_of_South_Africa \"Constitution of South Africa\").\nHowever, international precedent is only of guiding value, and is not binding.\nFor example, the Supreme Court has referred to the Charter and the American\nBill of Rights as being \"born to different countries in different ages and in\ndifferent circumstances.\"[26]\n\nPublic interest groups frequently [intervene](/wiki/Intervention_\\(law\\)\n\"Intervention \\(law\\)\") in cases to make arguments on how to interpret the\nCharter. Some examples are the [British Columbia Civil Liberties\nAssociation](/wiki/British_Columbia_Civil_Liberties_Association \"British\nColumbia Civil Liberties Association\"), [Canadian Civil Liberties\nAssociation](/wiki/Canadian_Civil_Liberties_Association \"Canadian Civil\nLiberties Association\"), the [Canadian Mental Health\nAssociation](/wiki/Canadian_Mental_Health_Association \"Canadian Mental Health\nAssociation\"), the [Canadian Labour Congress](/wiki/Canadian_Labour_Congress\n\"Canadian Labour Congress\"), the [Women's Legal Education and Action\nFund](/wiki/Women%27s_Legal_Education_and_Action_Fund \"Women's Legal Education\nand Action Fund\") (LEAF), and [REAL Women of\nCanada](/wiki/REAL_Women_of_Canada \"REAL Women of Canada\"). The purpose of\nsuch interventions is to assist the court and to attempt to influence the\ncourt to render a decision favourable to the legal interests of the group.\n\nA further approach to the Charter, taken by the courts, is the [dialogue\nprinciple](/wiki/Dialogue_principle \"Dialogue principle\"), which involves\ngreater participation by elected governments. This approach involves\ngovernments drafting legislation in response to court rulings and courts\nacknowledging the effort if the new legislation is challenged.\n\n## Comparisons with other human rights\ndocuments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Comparisons with other human rights documents\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Bill_of_Rights_Pg1of1_AC.jpg/220px-\nBill_of_Rights_Pg1of1_AC.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bill_of_Rights_Pg1of1_AC.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bill_of_Rights_Pg1of1_AC.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [United States Bill of Rights](/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights \"United\nStates Bill of Rights\") influenced the text of the Charter, but its rights\nprovisions are interpreted more conservatively. Canadian civil-rights and\nconstitutional cases as compared to American cases occasionally have\ndissimilar outcomes because the broader Charter rights are limited by the\n\"savings clause\" of [section 1 of the\nCharter](/wiki/Section_One_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms\n\"Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\") as interpreted\nin _[R. v. Oakes](/wiki/R._v._Oakes \"R. v. Oakes\")_\n\nSome Canadian [Members of Parliament](/wiki/Member_of_Parliament \"Member of\nParliament\") saw the movement to entrench a charter as contrary to the British\nmodel of [Parliamentary supremacy](/wiki/Parliamentary_supremacy\n\"Parliamentary supremacy\"). Others would say that the [European Convention on\nHuman Rights](/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights \"European Convention\non Human Rights\") (ECHR) has now limited British parliamentary power to a\ngreater degree than the Canadian Charter limited the power of the Canadian\nParliament and provincial legislatures. Hogg has speculated that the British\nadopted the [Human Rights Act 1998](/wiki/Human_Rights_Act_1998 \"Human Rights\nAct 1998\"), which allows the [ECHR](/wiki/ECHR \"ECHR\") to be enforced directly\nin domestic courts, partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian\nCharter.[27]\n\nThe Canadian Charter bears a number of similarities to the European\nConvention, specifically in relation to the limitations clauses contained in\nthe European document.[28] Because of this similarity with European human\nrights law, the Supreme Court of Canada turns not only to the [Constitution of\nthe United States](/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States \"Constitution of\nthe United States\") case law in interpreting the Charter, but also to\n[European Court of Human Rights](/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights\n\"European Court of Human Rights\") cases.\n\nThe core distinction between the United States Bill of Rights and Canadian\nCharter is the existence of the limitations and notwithstanding clauses.\nCanadian courts have consequently interpreted each right more expansively.[29]\nHowever, due to the limitations clause, where a violation of a right exists,\nthe law will not necessarily grant protection of that right.[29] In contrast,\nrights under the US Bill of Rights are absolute and so a violation will not be\nfound until there has been sufficient encroachment on those rights. The sum\neffect is that both constitutions provide comparable protection of many\nrights.[29] Fundamental justice (in section 7 of the Canadian Charter) is\ntherefore interpreted to include more legal protections than due process,\nwhich is its US equivalent. Freedom of expression in section 2 also has a more\nwide-ranging scope than the [First Amendment to the United States\nConstitution](/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\")'s freedom of speech.[29] In\n_[RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.](/wiki/RWDSU_v._Dolphin_Delivery_Ltd. \"RWDSU\nv. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.\")_ (1986), the Canadian Supreme Court considered\n[picketing](/wiki/Picketing_\\(protest\\) \"Picketing \\(protest\\)\") of the kind\nthe US First Amendment did not permit, as it was disruptive conduct (though\nthere was some speech involved that the First Amendment might otherwise\nprotect). The Supreme Court, however, ruled the picketing, including the\ndisruptive conduct, were fully protected under section 2 of the Charter. The\nCourt then relied on section 1 to find the injunction against the picketing\nwas just.[30] The limitations clause has also allowed governments to enact\nlaws that would be considered unconstitutional in the US. The Supreme Court of\nCanada has upheld some of Quebec's limits on the use of\n[English](/wiki/English_language \"English language\") on signs and has upheld\n[publication bans](/wiki/Publication_ban \"Publication ban\") that prohibit\nmedia from mentioning the names of juvenile criminals.\n\nSection 28 of the Charter performs a function similar to that of the\nunratified [Equal Rights Amendment](/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment \"Equal Rights\nAmendment\") in the US. While that proposed amendment had many critics, there\nwas no comparable opposition to the Charter's section 28.[31] Still, Canadian\nfeminists had to stage large protests to demonstrate support for the inclusion\nof the section which had not been part of the original draft of the\ncharter.[32][33]\n\nThe [International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights](/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights\n\"International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\") has several parallels\nwith the Canadian Charter, but in some cases the Covenant goes further with\nregard to rights in its text. For example, a right to [legal\naid](/wiki/Legal_aid \"Legal aid\") has been read into section 10 of the Charter\n(the right to counsel), but the Covenant explicitly guarantees the accused\nneed not pay \"if he does not have sufficient means.\"[34]\n\nThe Canadian Charter has little to say, explicitly at least, about economic\nand social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the\n[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and\nFreedoms](/wiki/Quebec_Charter_of_Human_Rights_and_Freedoms \"Quebec Charter of\nHuman Rights and Freedoms\") and with the [International Covenant on Economic,\nSocial and Cultural\nRights](/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights\n\"International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\"). There are\nsome who feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to\n[security of the person](/wiki/Security_of_the_person \"Security of the\nperson\") and section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the\nCovenant.[32] The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent\n[standard of living](/wiki/Standard_of_living \"Standard of living\") and can\nhelp the civil rights flourish in a livable environment.[32] Canadian courts,\nhowever, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are\n[political questions](/wiki/Political_question \"Political question\") and\nadding that as [positive rights](/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights \"Negative\nand positive rights\"), economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.[32]\n\nThe Charter itself influenced the [Bill of\nRights](/wiki/Constitution_of_South_Africa_Chapter_2:_Bill_of_Rights\n\"Constitution of South Africa Chapter 2: Bill of Rights\") in the Constitution\nof South Africa.[32] The limitations clause under section 36 of the South\nAfrican law has been compared to section 1 of that _Charter_.[28]\n\n[Jamaica](/wiki/Jamaica \"Jamaica\")'s Charter of Fundamental Rights and\nFreedoms was also influenced, in part, by the Canadian charter.[35][36]\n\n## The Charter and national\nvalues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: The Charter and national values\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/March_of_Hearts_crowd_on_Parliament_Hill_2004.jpg/250px-\nMarch_of_Hearts_crowd_on_Parliament_Hill_2004.jpg)](/wiki/File:March_of_Hearts_crowd_on_Parliament_Hill_2004.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:March_of_Hearts_crowd_on_Parliament_Hill_2004.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe \"March of Hearts\" rally for [same-sex marriage](/wiki/Same-\nsex_marriage_in_Canada \"Same-sex marriage in Canada\") equality under the\nCharter in 2004.\n\nThe Charter was intended to be a source for [Canadian\nvalues](/wiki/Canadian_values \"Canadian values\") and national unity. As\nProfessor [Alan Cairns](/wiki/Alan_Cairns \"Alan Cairns\") noted, \"The initial\nfederal government premise was on developing a pan-Canadian identity.\"[27]\nTrudeau himself later wrote in his _Memoirs_ that \"Canada itself\" could now be\ndefined as a \"society where all people are equal and where they share some\nfundamental values based upon freedom\", and that all Canadians could identify\nwith the values of liberty and equality.[37]\n\nThe Charter's unifying purpose was particularly important to the mobility and\nlanguage rights. According to author [Rand Dyck](/wiki/Rand_Dyck \"Rand Dyck\"),\nsome scholars believe section 23, with its minority language education rights,\n\"was the only part of the Charter with which Pierre Trudeau was truly\nconcerned\".[38] Through the mobility and language rights, [French\nCanadians](/wiki/French_Canadian \"French Canadian\"), who have been at the\ncentre of unity debates, are able to travel throughout all Canada and receive\ngovernment and educational services in their own language. Hence, they are not\nconfined to Quebec (the only province where they form the majority and where\nmost of their population is based), which would polarize the country along\nregional lines. The Charter was also supposed to standardize previously\ndiverse laws throughout the country and gear them towards a single principle\nof liberty.[39]\n\nFormer [premier of Ontario](/wiki/Premier_of_Ontario \"Premier of Ontario\")\n[Bob Rae](/wiki/Bob_Rae \"Bob Rae\") has stated that the Charter \"functions as a\nsymbol for all Canadians\" in practice because it represents the core value of\nfreedom.[27] Academic [Peter Russell](/wiki/Peter_H._Russell \"Peter H.\nRussell\") has been more skeptical of the Charter's value in this field.\nCairns, who feels the Charter is the most important constitutional document to\nmany Canadians, and that the Charter was meant to shape the Canadian identity,\nhas also expressed concern that groups within society see certain provisions\nas belonging to them alone rather than to all Canadians.[27] It has also been\nnoted that issues like [abortion](/wiki/Abortion \"Abortion\") and\n[pornography](/wiki/Pornography \"Pornography\"), raised by the Charter, tend to\nbe controversial.[39] Still, [opinion polls](/wiki/Opinion_polls \"Opinion\npolls\") in 2002 showed Canadians felt the Charter significantly represented\nCanada, although many were unaware of the document's actual contents.[40]\n\nThe only values mentioned by the [Charter's\npreamble](/wiki/Preamble_to_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms\n\"Preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\") are recognition for\nthe supremacy of [God](/wiki/Constitutional_references_to_God \"Constitutional\nreferences to God\") and the [rule of law](/wiki/Rule_of_law \"Rule of law\"),\nbut these have been controversial and of minor legal consequence. In 1999, MP\n[Svend Robinson](/wiki/Svend_Robinson \"Svend Robinson\") brought forward a\nfailed proposal before the [Canadian House of\nCommons](/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons \"Canadian House of Commons\") that\nwould have amended the Charter by removing the mention of God, as he felt it\ndid not reflect Canada's diversity.\n\nSection 27 also recognizes a value of multiculturalism. In 2002, polls found\n86% of Canadians approved of this section.[41]\n\n##\nCriticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Criticism\")]\n\nWhile the Charter has enjoyed a great deal of popularity, with 82% of\nCanadians describing it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999,[27]\nthe document has also been subject to published criticisms from both sides of\nthe political spectrum. One left-wing critic is Professor [Michael\nMandel](/wiki/Michael_Mandel_\\(law_professor\\) \"Michael Mandel \\(law\nprofessor\\)\"), who wrote that in comparison to politicians, judges do not have\nto be as sensitive to the will of the electorate, nor do they have to make\nsure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian\ncitizen. This, in Mandel's view, limits democracy.[42] Mandel has also\nasserted that the Charter makes Canada more like the United States, especially\nby serving corporate rights and [individual rights](/wiki/Individual_rights\n\"Individual rights\") rather than group rights and social rights.[42] He has\nargued that there are several things that should be included in the Charter,\nsuch as a right to health care and a basic right to free education. Hence, the\nperceived [Americanization](/wiki/Americanization \"Americanization\") of\nCanadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important\nfor Canadians.[42] The union movement has been disappointed in the reluctance\nof the courts to use the Charter to support various forms of union activity,\nsuch as the \"right to strike\".\n\nRight-wing critics Morton and Knopff have raised several concerns about the\nCharter, notably by alleging that the federal government has used it to limit\nprovincial powers by allying with various rights claimants and interest\ngroups. In their book _The Charter Revolution & the Court Party_, Morton and\nKnopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail, accusing the\nTrudeau and Chrétien governments of funding litigious groups. For example,\nthese governments used the [Court Challenges\nProgram](/wiki/Court_Challenges_Program_of_Canada \"Court Challenges Program of\nCanada\") to support minority language educational rights claims. Morton and\nKnopff also assert that [crown counsel](/wiki/Crown_attorney \"Crown attorney\")\nhas intentionally lost cases in which the government was taken to court for\nallegedly violating rights, particularly [gay rights](/wiki/Gay_rights \"Gay\nrights\") and [women's rights](/wiki/Women%27s_rights \"Women's rights\").[43]\n\nPolitical scientist Rand Dyck, in observing these criticisms, notes that while\njudges have had their scope of review widened, they have still upheld most\nlaws challenged on Charter grounds. With regard to litigious interest groups,\nDyck points out that \"the record is not as clear as Morton and Knopff imply.\nAll such groups have experienced wins and losses.\"[44]\n\nThe political philosopher [Charles\nBlattberg](/w/index.php?title=Charles_Blattberg&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Charles\nBlattberg \\(page does not exist\\)\") has criticized the Charter for\ncontributing to the fragmentation of the country, at both the individual and\ngroup levels. In encouraging discourse based upon rights, the Charter is said\nto inject an adversarial spirit into Canadian politics, making it difficult to\nrealize the common good. Blattberg also claims that the Charter undercuts the\nCanadian political community since it is ultimately a cosmopolitan document.\nFinally, he argues that people would be more motivated to uphold individual\nliberties if they were expressed with terms that are much \"thicker\" (less\nabstract) than rights.[45]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/32px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png)[Canada portal](/wiki/Portal:Canada \"Portal:Canada\")\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Can-vote-stub.svg/26px-Can-vote-stub.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Can-vote-stub.svg)[Canadian politics portal](/wiki/Portal:Canadian_politics \"Portal:Canadian politics\")\n\n![Book icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png) | \n\n  * [Book: Canada](/wiki/Book:Canada \"Book:Canada\")\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \n  * [Canadian Bill of Rights](/wiki/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights \"Canadian Bill of Rights\")\n  * [Canadian Human Rights Act](/wiki/Canadian_Human_Rights_Act \"Canadian Human Rights Act\")\n  * [History of Canada](/wiki/History_of_Canada \"History of Canada\")\n  * [Human rights in Canada](/wiki/Human_rights_in_Canada \"Human rights in Canada\")\n  * [Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms](/wiki/Quebec_Charter_of_Human_Rights_and_Freedoms \"Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms\")\n  * [Supreme Court of Canada](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada \"Supreme Court of Canada\")\n  * [Veterans' Bill of Rights](/wiki/Veterans%27_Bill_of_Rights \"Veterans' Bill of Rights\")\n    * [List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Dickson Court)](/wiki/List_of_Supreme_Court_of_Canada_cases_\\(Dickson_Court\\) \"List of Supreme Court of Canada cases \\(Dickson Court\\)\")\n    * [List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Lamer Court)](/wiki/List_of_Supreme_Court_of_Canada_cases_\\(Lamer_Court\\) \"List of Supreme Court of Canada cases \\(Lamer Court\\)\")\n    * [List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (McLachlin Court)](/wiki/List_of_Supreme_Court_of_Canada_cases_\\(McLachlin_Court\\) \"List of Supreme Court of Canada cases \\(McLachlin Court\\)\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Only one federal law was declared inoperative by the Supreme Court of Canada: _[R. v.
