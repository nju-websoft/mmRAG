The PNS consists of the [nerves](/wiki/Nerve \"Nerve\") and\n[ganglia](/wiki/Ganglia \"Ganglia\") outside the [brain](/wiki/Brain \"Brain\")\nand [spinal cord](/wiki/Spinal_cord \"Spinal cord\").[1] The main function of\nthe PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as\na relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body.[2] Unlike\nthe CNS, the PNS is not protected by the [vertebral\ncolumn](/wiki/Vertebral_column \"Vertebral column\") and [skull](/wiki/Skull\n\"Skull\"), or by the [blood–brain barrier](/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier\n\"Blood–brain barrier\"), which leaves it exposed to [toxins](/wiki/Toxin\n\"Toxin\") and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided\ninto the [somatic nervous system](/wiki/Somatic_nervous_system \"Somatic\nnervous system\") and the [autonomic nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system \"Autonomic nervous system\"). In the\nsomatic nervous system, the [cranial nerves](/wiki/Cranial_nerve \"Cranial\nnerve\") are part of the PNS with the exception of the [optic\nnerve](/wiki/Optic_nerve \"Optic nerve\") (cranial nerve II), along with the\n[retina](/wiki/Retina \"Retina\"). The second cranial nerve is not a true\nperipheral nerve but a tract of the [diencephalon](/wiki/Diencephalon\n\"Diencephalon\").[3] Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS. However, the\nremaining ten cranial nerve [axons](/wiki/Axon \"Axon\") extend beyond the brain\nand are therefore considered part of the PNS.[4] The autonomic nervous system\nis an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands. The connection between\nCNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states:\n[sympathetic](/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system \"Sympathetic nervous system\")\nand [parasympathetic](/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system \"Parasympathetic\nnervous system\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Structure\n    * 1.1 Somatic nervous system\n      * 1.1.1 Cervical spinal nerves (C1–C4)\n      * 1.1.2 Brachial plexus (C5–T1)\n      * 1.1.3 Lumbosacral plexus (L1–Co1)\n    * 1.2 Autonomic nervous system\n      * 1.2.1 Sympathetic nervous system\n      * 1.2.2 Parasympathetic nervous system\n  * 2 Disease\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n##\nStructure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Structure\")]\n\nThe peripheral nervous system is divided into the [somatic nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Somatic_nervous_system \"Somatic nervous system\"), and the\n[autonomic nervous system](/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system \"Autonomic nervous\nsystem\"). The somatic nervous system is under voluntary control, and transmits\nsignals from the brain to end organs such as [muscle](/wiki/Muscle \"Muscle\")s.\nThe [sensory nervous system](/wiki/Sensory_nervous_system \"Sensory nervous\nsystem\") is part of the somatic nervous system and transmits signals from\nsenses such as [taste](/wiki/Taste \"Taste\") and touch (including fine touch\nand gross touch) to the spinal cord and brain. The autonomic nervous system is\na 'self-regulating' system which influences the function of organs outside\nvoluntary control, such as the [heart rate](/wiki/Heart_rate \"Heart rate\"), or\nthe functions of the [digestive system](/wiki/Human_digestive_system \"Human\ndigestive system\").\n\n### Somatic nervous\nsystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Somatic nervous system\")]\n\nSee also: [List of nerves of the human\nbody](/wiki/List_of_nerves_of_the_human_body \"List of nerves of the human\nbody\")\n\nThe somatic system includes the [sensory nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Sensory_nervous_system \"Sensory nervous system\") and the\n[somatosensory system](/wiki/Somatosensory_system \"Somatosensory system\") and\nconsists of sensory nerves and somatic nerves, and many nerves which hold both\nfunctions.\n\nIn the [head](/wiki/Head \"Head\") and [neck](/wiki/Neck \"Neck\"), [cranial\nnerve](/wiki/Cranial_nerve \"Cranial nerve\")s carry somatosensory data. There\nare twelve cranial nerves, ten of which originate from the\n[brainstem](/wiki/Brainstem \"Brainstem\"), and mainly control the functions of\nthe anatomic structures of the head with some exceptions. The nuclei of the\n[olfactory nerve](/wiki/Olfactory_nerve \"Olfactory nerve\") and the [optic\nnerve](/wiki/Optic_nerve \"Optic nerve\")s lie in the forebrain and thalamus,\nrespectively, and are thus not considered to be true cranial nerves. One\nunique cranial nerve is the [vagus nerve](/wiki/Vagus_nerve \"Vagus nerve\"),\nwhich receives sensory information from organs in the thorax and abdomen. The\n[accessory nerve](/wiki/Accessory_nerve \"Accessory nerve\") is responsible for\ninnervating the [sternocleidomastoid](/wiki/Sternocleidomastoid_muscle\n\"Sternocleidomastoid muscle\") and [trapezius muscles](/wiki/Trapezius_muscle\n\"Trapezius muscle\"), neither of which being exclusively in the head.\n\nFor the rest of the body, [spinal nerves](/wiki/Spinal_nerve \"Spinal nerve\")\nare responsible for somatosensory information. These arise from the [spinal\ncord](/wiki/Spinal_cord \"Spinal cord\"). Usually these arise as a web\n(\"plexus\") of interconnected nerves roots that arrange to form single nerves.\nThese nerves control the functions of the rest of the body. In humans, there\nare 31 pairs of spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and\n1 coccygeal. These nerve roots are named according to the spinal vertebrata\nwhich they are adjacent to. In the cervical region, the spinal nerve roots\ncome out _above_ the corresponding vertebrae (i.e., nerve root between the\nskull and 1st cervical vertebrae is called spinal nerve C1). From the thoracic\nregion to the coccygeal region, the spinal nerve roots come out _below_ the\ncorresponding vertebrae. It is important to note that this method creates a\nproblem when naming the spinal nerve root between C7 and T1 (so it is called\nspinal nerve root C8). In the lumbar and sacral region, the spinal nerve roots\ntravel within the dural sac and they travel below the level of L2 as the cauda\nequina.\n\n#### Cervical spinal nerves\n(C1–C4)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Cervical spinal nerves \\(C1–C4\\)\")]\n\nFurther information: [Cervical plexus](/wiki/Cervical_plexus \"Cervical\nplexus\")\n\nThe first 4 cervical spinal nerves, C1 through C4, split and recombine to\nproduce a variety of nerves that serve the neck and back of head.\n\nSpinal nerve C1 is called the [suboccipital nerve](/wiki/Suboccipital_nerve\n\"Suboccipital nerve\"), which provides motor innervation to muscles at the base\nof the [skull](/wiki/Skull \"Skull\"). C2 and C3 form many of the nerves of the\nneck, providing both sensory and motor control. These include the [greater\noccipital nerve](/wiki/Greater_occipital_nerve \"Greater occipital nerve\"),\nwhich provides sensation to the back of the head, the [lesser occipital\nnerve](/wiki/Lesser_occipital_nerve \"Lesser occipital nerve\"), which provides\nsensation to the area behind the [ears](/wiki/Ear \"Ear\"), the [greater\nauricular nerve](/wiki/Greater_auricular_nerve \"Greater auricular nerve\") and\nthe [lesser auricular nerve](/wiki/Lesser_auricular_nerve \"Lesser auricular\nnerve\").\n\nThe [phrenic nerve](/wiki/Phrenic_nerve \"Phrenic nerve\") is a nerve essential\nfor our survival which arises from nerve roots C3, C4 and C5. It supplies the\n[thoracic diaphragm](/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm \"Thoracic diaphragm\"), enabling\n[breathing](/wiki/Breathing \"Breathing\"). If the spinal cord is transected\nabove C3, then spontaneous breathing is not possible.\n\n#### Brachial plexus\n(C5–T1)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Brachial plexus \\(C5–T1\\)\")]\n\nFurther information: [Brachial plexus](/wiki/Brachial_plexus \"Brachial\nplexus\")\n\nThe last four cervical spinal nerves, C5 through C8, and the first thoracic\nspinal nerve, T1, combine to form the [brachial plexus](/wiki/Brachial_plexus\n\"Brachial plexus\"), or plexus brachialis, a tangled array of nerves,\nsplitting, combining and recombining, to form the nerves that subserve the\nupper-limb and upper back. Although the brachial plexus may appear tangled, it\nis highly organized and predictable, with little variation between people. See\n[brachial plexus injuries](/wiki/Brachial_plexus_injuries \"Brachial plexus\ninjuries\").\n\n#### Lumbosacral plexus\n(L1–Co1)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Lumbosacral plexus \\(L1–Co1\\)\")]\n\nThe [anterior](/wiki/Anterior \"Anterior\") divisions of the [lumbar\nnerves](/wiki/Lumbar_nerves \"Lumbar nerves\"), [sacral\nnerves](/wiki/Sacral_nerves \"Sacral nerves\"), and [coccygeal\nnerve](/wiki/Coccygeal_nerve \"Coccygeal nerve\") form the [lumbosacral\nplexus](/wiki/Lumbosacral_plexus \"Lumbosacral plexus\"), the first lumbar nerve\nbeing frequently joined by a branch from the [twelfth\nthoracic](/wiki/Twelfth_thoracic \"Twelfth thoracic\"). For descriptive purposes\nthis plexus is usually divided into three parts:\n\n  * [lumbar plexus](/wiki/Lumbar_plexus \"Lumbar plexus\")\n  * [sacral plexus](/wiki/Sacral_plexus \"Sacral plexus\")\n  * [pudendal plexus](/wiki/Pudendal_plexus_\\(nerves\\) \"Pudendal plexus \\(nerves\\)\")\n\n### Autonomic nervous\nsystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Autonomic nervous system\")]\n\nThe [autonomic nervous system](/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system \"Autonomic\nnervous system\") controls involuntary responses to regulate physiological\nfunctions.[5] The brain and spinal cord from the [central nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Central_nervous_system \"Central nervous system\") are connected\nwith organs that have smooth muscle, such as the heart, bladder, and other\ncardiac, exocrine, and endocrine related organs, by ganglionic neurons.[5] The\nmost notable physiological effects from autonomic activity are pupil\nconstriction and dilation, and salivation of saliva.[5] The autonomic nervous\nsystem is always activated, but is either in the sympathetic or\nparasympathetic state.[5] Depending on the situation, one state can overshadow\nthe other, resulting in a release of different kinds of\n[neurotransmitters](/wiki/Neurotransmitters \"Neurotransmitters\").[5] There is\na lesser known division of the autonomic nervous system known as the [enteric\nnervous system](/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system \"Enteric nervous system\").[6]\nLocated only around the digestive tract, this system allows for local control\nwithout input from the sympathetic or the parasympathetic branches, though it\ncan still receive and respond to signals from the rest of the body.[6] The\nenteric system is responsible for various functions related to\ngastrointestinal system.[6]\n\n#### Sympathetic nervous\nsystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Sympathetic nervous system\")]\n\nThe [sympathetic system](/wiki/Sympathetic_system \"Sympathetic system\") is\nactivated during a “fight or flight” situation in which great mental stress or\nphysical danger is encountered.[5] Neurotransmitters such as\n[norepinephrine](/wiki/Norepinephrine \"Norepinephrine\"), and\n[epinephrine](/wiki/Epinephrine \"Epinephrine\") are released,[5] which\nincreases heart rate and blood flow in certain areas like muscle, while\nsimultaneously decreasing activities of non-critical functions for survival,\nlike digestion.[6] The systems are independent to each other, which allows\nactivation of certain parts of the body, while others remain rested.[6]\n\n#### Parasympathetic nervous\nsystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Parasympathetic nervous system\")]\n\nPrimarily using the neurotransmitter [acetylcholine](/wiki/Acetylcholine\n\"Acetylcholine\") (ACh) as a mediator, the [parasympathetic\nsystem](/wiki/Parasympathetic_system \"Parasympathetic system\") allows the body\nto function in a “rest and digest” state.[6] Consequently, when the\nparasympathetic system dominates the body, there are increases in salivation\nand activities in digestion, while heart rate and other sympathetic response\ndecrease.[6] Unlike the sympathetic system, humans have some voluntary\ncontrols in the parasympathetic system. The most prominent examples of this\ncontrol are urination and defecation.[6]\n\n##\nDisease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Disease\")]\n\nMain article: [Peripheral neuropathy](/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy \"Peripheral\nneuropathy\")\n\nDiseases of the peripheral nervous system can be specific to one or more\nnerves, or affect the system as a whole.\n\nAny peripheral nerve or nerve root can be damaged, called a\n[mononeuropathy](/wiki/Mononeuropathy \"Mononeuropathy\"). Such injuries can be\nbecause of injury or trauma, or [compression](/wiki/Compression_neuropathy\n\"Compression neuropathy\"). Compression of nerves can occur because of a tumour\nmass or injury. Alternatively, if a nerve is in an area with a fixed size it\nmay be trapped if the other components increase in size, such as [carpal\ntunnel syndrome](/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome \"Carpal tunnel syndrome\") and\n[tarsal tunnel syndrome](/wiki/Tarsal_tunnel_syndrome \"Tarsal tunnel\nsyndrome\"). Common symptoms of [carpal tunnel\nsyndrome](/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome \"Carpal tunnel syndrome\") include pain\nand numbness in the thumb, index and middle finger. In peripheral neuropathy,\nthe function one or more nerves are damaged through a variety of means. Toxic\ndamage may occur because of diabetes ([diabetic\nneuropathy](/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy \"Diabetic neuropathy\")), alcohol, heavy\nmetals or other toxins; some infections; autoimmune and inflammatory\nconditions such as [amyloidosis](/wiki/Amyloidosis \"Amyloidosis\") and\n[sarcoidosis](/wiki/Sarcoidosis \"Sarcoidosis\").[5] Peripheral neuropathy is\nassociated with a sensory loss in a \"glove and stocking\" distribution that\nbegins at the peripheral and slowly progresses upwards, and may also be\nassociated with acute and chronic pain. Peripheral neuropathy is not just\nlimited to the somatosensory nerves, but the autonomic nervous system too\n([autonomic neuropathy](/wiki/Autonomic_neuropathy \"Autonomic\nneuropathy\")).[5]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | Wikimedia Commons has media related to _**[Peripheral nervous system](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Peripheral_nervous_system \"commons:Category:Peripheral nervous system\")**_.  \n---|---  \n  \n  * [Connective tissue in the peripheral nervous system](/wiki/Connective_tissue_in_the_peripheral_nervous_system \"Connective tissue in the peripheral nervous system\")\n  * [Preferential motor reinnervation](/wiki/Preferential_motor_reinnervation \"Preferential motor reinnervation\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Peripheral_nervous_system&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** \"[peripheral nervous system](https://archive.org/web/20090616022448/http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/nine/20114043.htm)\" at _[Dorland's Medical Dictionary](/wiki/Dorland%27s_medical_reference_works \"Dorland's medical reference works\")_\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Slide show: How your brain works - Mayo Clinic\"](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain/BN00033&slide=6). _mayoclinic.com_.
