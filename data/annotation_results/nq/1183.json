This design also makes it ideal for flood and ice rescue\noperations.[1][2]\n\nThe airboat is pushed forward by the propeller, which produces a rearward\ncolumn of air behind it. The resulting [prop wash](/wiki/Prop_wash \"Prop\nwash\") averages 150 miles per hour (241 km/h). Steering is accomplished by\ndiverting that column of air left or right as it passes across the rudders,\nwhich the pilot controls via a \"stick\" located on the operator's left side.\nOverall steering and control is a function of water current, wind, water\ndepth, and propeller thrust. Airboats are very fast compared to comparably-\nsized [motorboats](/wiki/Motorboat \"Motorboat\"): commercial airboats generally\nsail at speeds of around 35 miles per hour (30 kn) and modified airboats can\ngo as fast as 135 miles per hour (117 kn).[3]\n\nStopping and reversing direction are dependent upon high operator skill, since\nairboats do not have brakes.[3] They are incapable of traveling in reverse,\nunless equipped with a [reversible propeller](/wiki/Reversible_propeller\n\"Reversible propeller\"). Some designs use a clam shell reversing device\nintended for braking or backing up very short distances but these systems are\nnot commonly used.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe operator and passengers, are typically seated in elevated seats that allow\nvisibility over swamp vegetation. High visibility lets the operator and\npassengers see floating objects, stumps and other submerged obstacles, and\nanimals in the boat's path.[1][4]\n\nIn the United States, a typical good-quality airboat costs between\n$33,000[5][note 2] and $70,000.[6] In a developing country like Iraq, however,\nan airboat can be purchased for as little as 2.5 million [Iraqi\ndinars](/wiki/Iraqi_dinar \"Iraqi dinar\"), or $2,147.[7] In spite of their high\ncost, airboats are very widely used by civilians and tour operators: there are\n12,164 airboats, 1,025 of them commercial, in Florida alone as of December\n2017.[3] Airboats are widely used in other [Gulf Coast](/wiki/Gulf_Coast \"Gulf\nCoast\") states, especially [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\"), but they\ncan be found in rivers, marshes, and icy areas around the world, from\n[Nebraska](/wiki/Nebraska \"Nebraska\")[8] to [Siberia](/wiki/Siberia\n\"Siberia\").\n\n### Soviet airboats and\naerosleds[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Soviet airboats and aerosleds\")]\n\nMain article: [Aerosled](/wiki/Aerosled \"Aerosled\")\n\nAirboats and airboat-like craft have been used in the [Soviet\nUnion](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") and its successor states since the\n[Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War \"Second World War\") and possibly\nearlier. Some true airboats—vessels that operated entirely in the water—were\nused by the Soviet military in [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War\nII\"). These true airboats include the\n[NKL-5](/w/index.php?title=NKL-5&action=edit&redlink=1 \"NKL-5 \\(page does not\nexist\\)\"), a 1,200 kilograms (2,600 lb) WWII armed boat reportedly capable of\nspeeds up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 mph; 32 kn).[9] However, most Soviet\nairboats are [aerosleds](/wiki/Aerosled \"Aerosled\") (referred to as\n\"aerosanis\" in Russian). An aerosled is an aircraft propeller driven\namphibious vehicle best described as a hybrid of a sled, airboat, and [ground\neffect vehicle](/wiki/Ground_effect_vehicle \"Ground effect vehicle\").\nThousands of aerosleds were used as cargo and passenger vehicles in\n[Siberia](/wiki/Siberia \"Siberia\"), where they excelled because they could\ncope equally well with the icy Siberian winter and the muddy, marshy\nconditions of [Rasputitsa](/wiki/Rasputitsa \"Rasputitsa\") season (similar to\nthe American [mud season](/wiki/Mud_season \"Mud season\")), when raw or thawing\nsnow makes travel by road impossible. Aerosleds are still in use today.[10]\nThe [Tupolev A-3 Aerosledge](/wiki/Tupolev_A-3_Aerosledge \"Tupolev A-3\nAerosledge\") is a quintessential example of this type of vehicle; it can reach\nspeeds of up to 120 kilometers per hour (74.6 mph) on snow and 65 km/h (40.4\nmph) on water.[11]\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nThe earliest airboats date to 1915, when they were used by the [British\nArmy](/wiki/British_Army \"British Army\") in the World War I [Mesopotamian\nCampaign](/wiki/Mesopotamian_Campaign \"Mesopotamian Campaign\").[12] However,\nairboats were not widely used by civilians until the 1940s and 1950s,\nfollowing the invention of a more practical airboat design in 1946 in\n[Utah](/wiki/Utah \"Utah\").[13]\n\n### Antecedents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Antecedents\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Ugly_Duckling.jpg/220px-\nUgly_Duckling.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ugly_Duckling.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ugly_Duckling.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDr. Alexander Graham Bell with his aircraft engine test boat and airboat\nancestor, the _Ugly Duckling_\n\nThe earliest ancestors of the airboat were waterborne vehicles for testing\naircraft engines. The oldest ancestor of the airboat was the _Ugly Duckling_ ,\nan aircraft propeller testing vehicle built in 1905 in [Nova\nScotia](/wiki/Nova_Scotia \"Nova Scotia\"), Canada by a team led by Dr.\n[Alexander Graham Bell](/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell \"Alexander Graham Bell\").\n_Ugly Duckling_ was a [catamaran](/wiki/Catamaran \"Catamaran\")-type boat\npropelled by an \"aerial propeller\" hooked up to a water-cooled aircraft engine\nweighing 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg). The makeshift raft-like vessel was unable to\nobtain a speed faster than 4 miles per hour (3.5 [knots](/wiki/Knot_\\(unit\\)\n\"Knot \\(unit\\)\")), though the \"rapid rotation of the propeller\" led Dr. Bell\nto believe that the vessel could have had a theoretical top speed of \"thirty\nor forty miles an hour,\" comparable to some modern airboats, if drag was\ncompletely eliminated.[14] Brazilian aviation pioneer [Santos\nDumont](/wiki/Santos_Dumont \"Santos Dumont\") built a similar catamaran vessel\nfor testing an aircraft engine in 1907, which he termed a\n[hydrofoil](/wiki/Hydrofoil \"Hydrofoil\").[15]\n\nThe [Tellier\nbrothers](/w/index.php?title=Tellier_brothers&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Tellier\nbrothers \\(page does not exist\\)\"), French aviation pioneers, made major steps\ntowards modern airboats with their 1907 speedboat _La Rapière II_ (_Rapier\nII_). _La Rapière II_ was an 8 metres (26 ft) long mahogany speedboat powered\nby an above water aircraft propeller hooked up to a 20 hp 4 cylinder [Panhard-\nLevassor](/wiki/Panhard-Levassor \"Panhard-Levassor\") engine. The boat was\nsteered by a conventional rudder in the water, which was hooked up to a ship's\nwheel.[16] _La Rapière II_ could achieve speeds of up to 26 kilometres per\nhour (16 mph; 14 kn) with two people on board and 25 kilometres per hour (16\nmph; 13 kn) with 3-4 people on board.[15]\n\n### Early airboats[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Early airboats\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Glisseur_automobile_de_l%27arm%C3%A9e_anglaise_en_M%C3%A9sopotamie.jpg/220px-\nGlisseur_automobile_de_l%27arm%C3%A9e_anglaise_en_M%C3%A9sopotamie.jpg)](/wiki/File:Glisseur_automobile_de_l%27arm%C3%A9e_anglaise_en_M%C3%A9sopotamie.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Glisseur_automobile_de_l%27arm%C3%A9e_anglaise_en_M%C3%A9sopotamie.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nEarly [British Army](/wiki/British_Army \"British Army\") airboats in\n[Mesopotamia](/wiki/Mesopotamia \"Mesopotamia\") in 1918\n\nThe earliest true airboats date to 1915. The [British Army](/wiki/British_Army\n\"British Army\") used airboats, which they referred to as Lambert \"Hydro-\nGlisseurs\",[note 3] in the [Mesopotamian Campaign](/wiki/Mesopotamian_Campaign\n\"Mesopotamian Campaign\") of the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War \"First\nWorld War\"). These \"Hydro-Glisseurs\" were small, flat-bottomed\n[hydroplanes](/wiki/Hydroplane_\\(boat\\) \"Hydroplane \\(boat\\)\") with [metal-\nplated](/wiki/Ironclad \"Ironclad\") wooden hulls propelled by a large aircraft\nfan that allowed them to reach speeds of up to 55 miles per hour (48 kn).[17]\nThey were primarily used for reconnaissance on the [Tigris\nRiver](/wiki/Tigris_River \"Tigris River\").[12] The first of these airboats, HG\n1 _Ariel_ , was constructed using the engine and propeller of a wrecked [Royal\nAustralian Air Force](/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force \"Royal Australian Air\nForce\") [Farman MF.7](/wiki/Farman_MF.7 \"Farman MF.7\") biplane and was\nprovided to the forces in Mesopotamia by the [British Raj](/wiki/British_Raj\n\"British Raj\").[18] Following _Ariel_ 's successful deployment in the campaign\nupriver to [Kut](/wiki/Kut \"Kut\") in 1915-1916, Britain ordered seven purpose-\nbuilt airboats from [Charles de Lambert](/wiki/Charles_de_Lambert_\\(aviator\\)\n\"Charles de Lambert \\(aviator\\)\")'s eponymous company _De Lambert_. Eight of\nthese vessels were in operation in 1917, increasing to nine by the 1918\n[Armistice](/wiki/Armistice_of_11_November_1918 \"Armistice of 11 November\n1918\").[19] A dedicated repair slipway for these boats was built at the Motor\nRepair Dockyard in [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\"), indicating both their\nimportance to the British war effort and the difficulty of maintaining\nthem.[19]:67-8\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/ScientificAmerican1917-11-03.jpg/220px-\nScientificAmerican1917-11-03.jpg)](/wiki/File:ScientificAmerican1917-11-03.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ScientificAmerican1917-11-03.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA 1917 _[Scientific American](/wiki/Scientific_American \"Scientific\nAmerican\")_ cover depicting a British Army airboat on the [Tigris\nRiver](/wiki/Tigris_River \"Tigris River\") in Iraq\n\nFollowing the war, Lambert airboats were used as ferries on the shallow waters\nof the [upper Yangtze River](/wiki/Upper_Yangtze_River \"Upper Yangtze River\"),\non the [Huangpu River](/wiki/Huangpu_River \"Huangpu River\"), and elsewhere.\nLike their military counterparts, these airboats were manufactured in France,\nthough they were assembled in [Shanghai](/wiki/Shanghai \"Shanghai\").

Compared to the airboats of today, early European airboats\ntended to be somewhat larger, had higher [freeboards](/wiki/Freeboard\n\"Freeboard\"), and lacked a protective cage surrounding the propeller.[20] They\nalso had a different steering mechanism: early airboats were steered with a\n[rudder](/wiki/Rudder \"Rudder\") in the water controlled by a [steering\nwheel](/wiki/Steering_wheel \"Steering wheel\") with throttle control provided\nby a [gas pedal](/wiki/Gas_pedal \"Gas pedal\"), like an\n[automobile](/wiki/Automobile \"Automobile\").[19] More modern airboats use an\n[air rudder](/wiki/Rudder#Aircraft_rudders \"Rudder\") controlled with a\n[joystick](/wiki/Joystick \"Joystick\") for steering.\n\n[Glenn Curtiss](/wiki/Glenn_Curtiss \"Glenn Curtiss\") is credited with building\na type of airboat in 1920 to help facilitate his hobby of bow and arrow\nhunting in the Florida backwoods. The millionaire, who later went on to\ndevelop the cities of [Hialeah](/wiki/Hialeah \"Hialeah\") and\n[Miami](/wiki/Miami \"Miami\"), combined his talents in the fields of aviation\nand design to facilitate his hobby, and the end result was _Scooter_ , a\n6-passenger, closed-cabin, propeller-driven boat powered by an aircraft engine\nthat allowed it to slip through wetlands at 50 miles per hour (43 kn).[21][22]\n\n### First American\nairboats[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: First American airboats\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Early_airboat.jpg/220px-\nEarly_airboat.jpg)](/wiki/File:Early_airboat.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Early_airboat.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCecil Williams operating _Alligator I_ , one of the first airboats, at [Bear\nRiver Migratory Bird Refuge](/wiki/Bear_River_Migratory_Bird_Refuge \"Bear\nRiver Migratory Bird Refuge\") in 1946\n\nAirboats first became popular in the United States following the invention of\nan airboat more suitable for wetland use in 1943 by Cecil Williams, Leo Young,\nand G. Hortin Jensen.[23] Their boat, developed and used near [Brigham City,\nUtah](/wiki/Brigham_City,_Utah \"Brigham City, Utah\"), is often erroneously\nconsidered the first airboat. At the [Bear River Migratory Bird\nRefuge](/wiki/Bear_River_Migratory_Bird_Refuge \"Bear River Migratory Bird\nRefuge\") in northern Utah, Cecil S. Williams and G. Hortin Jensen sought a\nsolution to the problem of conducting avian [botulism](/wiki/Botulism\n\"Botulism\") studies in the shallow, marshy hinterlands. By installing a\n40-horsepower [Continental](/wiki/Continental_Motors,_Inc. \"Continental\nMotors, Inc.\") aircraft engine, purchased for $99.50, on a flat-bottomed\n12-foot long aluminum boat, they built one of the world's first modern\nairboats. Their airboat, pictured at left, had no seat, so the skipper was\nforced to kneel in the boat. They dubbed it the _Alligator I_ as a response to\na joking comment from [US Fish and Wildlife\nService](/wiki/US_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service \"US Fish and Wildlife Service\")\nheadquarters that they should \"get an [alligator](/wiki/Alligator \"Alligator\")\nfrom Louisiana, saddle up and ride the critter during their botulism\nstudies.\"[24] Their airboat was the first to use an air rudder (a rudder\ndirecting the propeller exhaust rather than the water), a major improvement in\nmodern airboat design.[13]\n\nThe purpose of Williams, Young, and Jensen's airboat was to help preserve and\nprotect bird populations and animal life at the world's largest migratory game\nbird refuge.[25] The Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge near [Brigham City,\nUtah](/wiki/Brigham_City,_Utah \"Brigham City, Utah\") is a wetlands oasis amid\nthe [Great Basin Desert](/wiki/Great_Basin_Desert \"Great Basin Desert\") and an\nessential stopping point for birds migrating across North America. The need\nfor a practical way to navigate a challenging environment of wetlands, shallow\nwater, and thick mud helped inspire Williams, Young, and Jensen to create the\nflat-bottom airboat, which they initially called an \"air thrust boat.\"[13]\nDesigns and subsequent improvements and practical use of the air thrust boats\nappears to have been a collaborative effort. LeeRue Allen, who worked at the\nRefuge since 1936 appears to have also been involved and helped to document a\nhistory of the events.[26]\n\nMany of the early airboats built at the refuge in Utah were shipped to\nFlorida. Early records show it cost roughly $1,600 to build a boat, including\nthe engine.[13]\n\nOther people—all Floridians—who are sometimes claimed to have invented the\nairboat include frog hunter Johnny Lamb, who allegedly built a 75 horsepower\nairboat in 1933 he called the \"whooshmobile\" and\n[Chokoloskee](/wiki/Chokoloskee \"Chokoloskee\") Gladesmen Ernest and Willard\nYates, who claim to have built an airboat in 1935 they steered via\n[reins](/wiki/Reins \"Reins\") attached to a crude wooden rudder.[27]\n\nOver the years a variety of designs were tried and through trial-and-error,\nthe standard design used today arose: an open, flat bottom boat with an engine\nmounted on the back, the driver sitting in an elevated position, and a cage to\nprotect the propeller from objects flying into them.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Hydrilla_verticillata_collection_LakeSeminoleFL.jpg/170px-\nHydrilla_verticillata_collection_LakeSeminoleFL.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hydrilla_verticillata_collection_LakeSeminoleFL.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hydrilla_verticillata_collection_LakeSeminoleFL.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [US Army Corps of Engineers](/wiki/US_Army_Corps_of_Engineers \"US Army\nCorps of Engineers\") uses an airboat to collect herbicide-resistant\n[hydrilla](/wiki/Hydrilla \"Hydrilla\") from [Lake Seminole](/wiki/Lake_Seminole\n\"Lake Seminole\") in northern Florida\n\n## Manufacture and\ndesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section:\nManufacture and design\")]\n\nAirboat manufacturers tend to be small, family run businesses that assemble\nbuilt-to-order boats. Most airboats are manufactured in the United States,\nalthough they are also built in [Russia](/wiki/Russia \"Russia\"),[28],\n[Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\"),[29] [Finland](/wiki/Finland \"Finland\"),[2][30]\n[Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\"),[31] [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"),[4]\nand elsewhere. Prior to 1950, most airboats were manufactured in France by\ncompanies and individuals such as [Farman](/wiki/Farman \"Farman\"), [De\nLambert](/wiki/Charles_de_Lambert_\\(aviator\\) \"Charles de Lambert\n\\(aviator\\)\"), and [René Couzinet](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Couzinet \"René\nCouzinet\").[15]\n\nModern, commercially manufactured airboat hulls are made of aluminum or\nfiberglass. The choice of material is determined by the type of terrain in\nwhich the vessel will be operated; airboats intended for use in icy conditions\nwill have sturdier polymer coated aluminum hulls while airboats intended for\nuse in marshes will have lighter fiberglass hulls, for instance.[5] Standard\nhunt/trail boats are 10 feet (3.0 m) long with a two- to three-passenger\ncapacity. Tour boats can be much larger, accommodating 18 passengers or\nmore.[3]\n\nEngines are either an air-cooled, 4- or 6-cylinder aircraft or water-cooled,\nlarge-displacement, V8 automotive engine, ranging from 50 to over 600\n[hp](/wiki/Hp \"Hp\"). Automotive engines tend to be less expensive due to\nreadily-available replacement parts and less expensive [high\noctane](/wiki/Octane_number \"Octane number\") automotive gas. Since an opposed,\n4- or 6-cylinder (O4 or O6) aircraft powerplant contains fewer moving parts\nthan a standard automotive engine, it is easier to repair and weighs\nless.[3][1] However, automotive engines can be repaired by more-common car\nmechanics and do not require specialized repair personnel like aircraft\nengines do.[5]\n\nMost of the sound produced by an airboat comes from the propeller, although\nthe engine itself also contributes some noise. Modern airboat designs are\nsignificantly quieter thanks to mufflers and multi-blade carbon-fiber\npropellers.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Safety[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Safety\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Air_boat_-\n_aft_view.JPG/170px-Air_boat_-_aft_view.JPG)](/wiki/File:Air_boat_-\n_aft_view.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Air_boat_-_aft_view.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nAft view of a safety cage during operation\n\nAs with any vehicle, the safety of an airboat is dependent on the training and\nskill of its operator and the use of safety features like seat belts and\n[flotation devices](/wiki/Flotation_device \"Flotation device\")/life jackets.\nAirboats should only be piloted by trained and qualified operators,[5] and\nknowledge of operational safety is essential when operating an airboat.[3]\n\nOver 75 airboat accidents happened in Florida between 2014 and 2017, resulting\nin seven deaths and 102 severe injuries. Most (five of seven) deaths were\ndrownings, and 90 percent of accident victims were not wearing [life\njackets](/wiki/Life_jacket \"Life jacket\"), even though only 30 percent knew\nhow to swim. Not wearing a [seat belt](/wiki/Seat_belt \"Seat belt\") is another\nmajor predictor of injury in an accident: 40 percent of injured victims and\nthe only two non-drowning fatalities were flung from their seats in the\ncrashes. The most common injuries suffered in airboat accidents are severe\ncuts, bruises, and broken limbs. Other severe injuries are not uncommon: 10\npercent of injured people suffered neck and back injuries requiring surgery\nand long-term pain medication and another 10 percent suffered traumatic head\nand brain injuries.[3]\n\nMost airboat accidents—64%—are the fault of the operator, according to a 2017\nanalysis by the _[Miami New Times](/wiki/Miami_New_Times \"Miami New Times\")_ ,\nalmost always due to one of three factors:[3]\n\n  1. a lack of boating education or training;\n  2. a lack of safety equipment, such as seat belts or flotation devices, or a failure to properly use safety equipment;\n  3. or reckless behavior, including [drug or alcohol consumption](/wiki/Operating_while_impaired \"Operating while impaired\") and improper lookout.\n\nThe engine and propeller of an airboat are enclosed in a protective metal cage\nthat prevents objects, such as tree limbs, branches, clothing, beverage\ncontainers, passengers, or wildlife, from coming into contact with the\nwhirling propeller, which can cause traumatic injury to the operator and\npassengers or devastating damage to the vessel.[5] Safety cages do not always\nwork perfectly, however: people have had their fingers sliced off by airboat\npropellers, and tree branches entering safety cages have wrecked airboat\npropellers and sprayed the operators and passengers with\n[woodchips](/wiki/Woodchips \"Woodchips\") and other shrapnel.[3]\n\nAirboats are prone to capsizing and sinking because they are top-heavy,\nunstable, and extremely shallow draft. This makes them especially dangerous on\nthe [open sea](/wiki/Open_sea \"Open sea\") or in [rough](/wiki/Sea_state \"Sea\nstate\") or [stormy conditions](/wiki/Violent_storm \"Violent storm\").[32]\nAirboats with a \"long-belt gear reduction drive unit\" and an automobile engine\navoid these risks because the long belt allows for the engine to be mounted\ninside the hull, which lowers the [center of gravity](/wiki/Center_of_gravity\n\"Center of gravity\") and lowers the capsizing risk.[5] Some companies and\norganizations, including Airboat West and the [Los Alamos National\nLaboratory](/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory \"Los Alamos National\nLaboratory\"), have built airboats with low centers of gravity for use in windy\nor rough conditions or in rescues with obstacles like low-hanging power\nlines.[33] Airboats can also be equipped with auotinflation devices, similar\nto car airbags or autoinflating personal life vests, that can reduce the risk\nof capsizing.[5]\n\nIn 1999 the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's [National Conservation Training\nCenter](/wiki/National_Conservation_Training_Center \"National Conservation\nTraining Center\"), located in [Shepherdstown, West\nVirginia](/wiki/Shepherdstown,_West_Virginia \"Shepherdstown, West Virginia\"),\nproduced a 70-minute training video entitled _Airboat Safety – Design-\nOperation-Maintenance_ in cooperation with the [U.S. Army Corps of\nEngineers](/wiki/U.S._Army_Corps_of_Engineers \"U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\")\nin [Jacksonville, Florida](/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida \"Jacksonville,\nFlorida\"). The video includes an early history of airboats and interviews with\ntwo airboat manufacturers in Florida. It was considered to be the only airboat\nvideo of its kind when it was made and may still be the only one with the\nrange of airboat subject matter ever produced in the US. Since it was produced\nby the federal government of the United States, it is in the [public\ndomain](/wiki/Public_domain \"Public domain\"). Five hundred copies of the video\nwere produced.[34]\n\n### Regulation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Regulation\")]\n\nOn March 30, 2018 [Gov. Rick Scott](/wiki/Rick_Scott \"Rick Scott\") of Florida\nsigned “Ellie’s Law,” which requires operators to complete [CPR](/wiki/CPR\n\"CPR\") instruction and a course on airboats run by the state’s wildlife\ncommission. The law is named after Elizabeth “Ellie” Goldenberg, who died from\nan airboat accident in [Miami-Dade County](/wiki/Miami-Dade_County \"Miami-Dade\nCounty\") the day after her graduation from college.[35] Beginning July 1,\n2019, airboat operators will need to be able to show proof they completed the\ntraining courses. Violations are a misdemeanor offense punishable by up to a\n$500 fine.\n\nFlorida state law also stipulates that airboats must have an \"automotive-style\nfactory [muffler](/wiki/Muffler \"Muffler\"), underwater exhaust, or other\nmanufactured device capable of adequately muffling the sound of the engine\nexhaust\" and an [international orange](/wiki/International_orange\n\"International orange\") flag that is at least 10\" by 12\" flying from a mast or\nflagpole that is at least 10 feet taller than the lowest point on the boat, in\norder to increase visibility and reduce the odds of a collision.[36]\n\nAirboat operators, pilots, or drivers in Florida must be 14 or older.[37]\n\n## Rescue[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Rescue\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/FEMA_-_14511_-_Photograph_by_Jocelyn_Augustino_taken_on_08-30-2005_in_Louisiana.jpg/220px-\nFEMA_-_14511_-_Photograph_by_Jocelyn_Augustino_taken_on_08-30-2005_in_Louisiana.jpg)](/wiki/File:FEMA_-_14511_-_Photograph_by_Jocelyn_Augustino_taken_on_08-30-2005_in_Louisiana.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:FEMA_-_14511_-_Photograph_by_Jocelyn_Augustino_taken_on_08-30-2005_in_Louisiana.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nA resident is transported by airboat after Hurricane Katrina\n\nIn recent years, airboats have proven indispensable for flood, shallow water,\nand ice rescue operations. As a result, they have grown in popularity for\npublic safety uses.\n\nDuring the flooding of [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\")\nfollowing [Hurricane Katrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina \"Hurricane Katrina\"),\nAugust 29, 2005, airboats from across the United States rescued thousands of\nflood victims.[38] Thirty airboats crewed by civilian volunteers evacuated\nover 1,100 patients and 4,000 medical personnel and family members from four\ndowntown New Orleans hospitals in less than 36 hours.[39]\n\nNumerous articles have been published in fire-rescue trade journals such as\n_[Fire Engineering](/wiki/Fire_Engineering_\\(magazine\\) \"Fire Engineering\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ and _[National Fire and Rescue\nMagazine](/w/index.php?title=National_Fire_and_Rescue_Magazine&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"National Fire and Rescue Magazine \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ describing the\nadvantages, capabilities, and benefits of using airboats for water rescue\noperations, and providing in-depth description of actual water rescue\nincidents, including the flooding of New Orleans.[39][40][1][5][41][42]\n\nAirboats are particularly effective at water rescues in shallow, marshy, or\nicy winter environments. Airboats are partially\n[amphibious](/wiki/Amphibious_vehicle \"Amphibious vehicle\") and can therefore\nnavigate effectively over obstacles, such as partially submerged buildings and\nwreckage or [sea ice](/wiki/Sea_ice \"Sea ice\"), that would stop a normal boat.\nIn ice rescues, use of airboats cuts the average rescue time from 45 to 60\nminutes to seven to 12 minutes, according to data from Minnesota fire\ndepartments departments. They are also faster, larger, safer, and more durable\nthan other small boats used in ice rescues.[5]\n\nThough airboats are highly effective at water and ice rescues, airboats and\n[helicopters](/wiki/Helicopter \"Helicopter\") do not work well together. Rotor\nwash from low-flying helicopters can push and even capsize airboats. During\npost-Katrina rescue operations, a helicopter's rotor wash was reported to have\ncapsized one airboat, and many airboats were blown into the sides of\nbuildings, standing utility poles, and bridge pilings by low-flying\nhelicopters.[39]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection%2C_Riverine_Unit_Patrols_Rio_Grande_River_Border_in_Air-\nBoat.jpg/220px-U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection%2C_Riverine_Unit_Patrols_Rio_Grande_River_Border_in_Air-\nBoat.jpg)](/wiki/File:U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection,_Riverine_Unit_Patrols_Rio_Grande_River_Border_in_Air-\nBoat.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection,_Riverine_Unit_Patrols_Rio_Grande_River_Border_in_Air-\nBoat.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[U.S. Customs and Border Protection](/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection\n\"U.S. Customs and Border Protection\") patrols the [Rio Grande\nRiver](/wiki/Rio_Grande_River \"Rio Grande River\") border in an airboat\n\n## Military use[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Military use\")]\n\nAirboats are used by various militaries and border patrols around the world as\nwell as by the [U.S. Coast Guard](/wiki/U.S._Coast_Guard \"U.S. Coast\nGuard\").[43] In addition to the aforementioned uses of airboats by the British\nArmy in the Mesopotamian Campaign of WWI and by the Soviet Union in the\n[Eastern Front](/wiki/Eastern_Front_\\(World_War_II\\) \"Eastern Front \\(World\nWar II\\)\") of WWII, airboats have been used by the [US Army](/wiki/US_Army \"US\nArmy\") and [Iraqi security forces](/wiki/Iraqi_security_forces \"Iraqi security\nforces\") in the Vietnam and Iraq wars, respectively.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/MIKE_Force_Aircat.jpg/220px-\nMIKE_Force_Aircat.jpg)](/wiki/File:MIKE_Force_Aircat.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MIKE_Force_Aircat.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nUS Special Forces Aircat airboat in Vietnam\n\nDuring the [Vietnam War](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\") the [Hurricane\nAircat](/wiki/Hurricane_Aircat \"Hurricane Aircat\") airboat was used by [U.S.\nSpecial Forces](/wiki/U.S._Special_Forces \"U.S. Special Forces\") and [South\nVietnamese troops](/wiki/ARVN \"ARVN\") to patrol riverine and marshy areas\nwhere larger boats could not go.[44] Two of these airboats were also used by\nthe [Khmer National Navy](/wiki/Khmer_National_Navy \"Khmer National Navy\")\nafter they were captured from the U.S. Special Forces by the [People's Army of\nVietnam](/wiki/People%27s_Army_of_Vietnam \"People's Army of Vietnam\") (PAVN)\nin September 1967.[45][46]\n\nAirboats are also used in Texas and Iraq for border patrol.[47] The airboats\nused in Iraq were supplied by American companies and assembled in Iraq by\nAmerican civilian contractors, and they are used by both American and Iraqi\nforces to patrol the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the\n[marshes](/wiki/Mesopotamian_Marshes \"Mesopotamian Marshes\") of southeastern\nIraq, and the [Shatt al-Arab](/wiki/Shatt_al-Arab \"Shatt al-Arab\") waterway,\nthe latter two of which include parts of the Iran-Iraq border.[48] Modern\nIraqi military airboats are 18 feet (5.5 m) long, powered by 454 hp engines\nhooked up to 78-inch (2.0 m) Whirlwind propellers, and armed with\n[M240](/wiki/M240 \"M240\") crew-served machine guns.[48] The Nov/Dec 2007 issue\nof _[Airboating\nMagazine](/w/index.php?title=Airboating_Magazine&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Airboating Magazine \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ had an article on airboats\nused in Vietnam and in Iraq and has had numerous articles on airboats used by\nU.S Coast Guard and other state and county\n[EMS](/wiki/Emergency_medical_services \"Emergency medical services\") units for\nrescue of [ice fisherman](/wiki/Ice_fishing \"Ice fishing\") and rescue in\nfloods or after hurricanes.\n\nIn 2013 the [Iraqi Ministry of Oil](/wiki/Ministry_of_Oil_\\(Iraq\\) \"Ministry\nof Oil \\(Iraq\\)\") purchased 20 airboats for use as personnel transport,\npatrol, and cable laying and light cargo boats in the rivers and marshes of\nIraq.[7]\n\n  \n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Hovercraft](/wiki/Hovercraft \"Hovercraft\")\n  * [Hydrocopter](/wiki/Hydrocopter \"Hydrocopter\")\n  * [Rotor ship](/wiki/Rotor_ship \"Rotor ship\"), a similar type of vessel using a vertical \"pipe\" to propel the air\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airboat&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** In early [aviation](/wiki/Aviation \"Aviation\") history the term _airboat_ was applied to [seaplanes](/wiki/Seaplane \"Seaplane\") or [flying boats](/wiki/Flying_boat \"Flying boat\"), i.e.[amphibian aircraft](/wiki/Amphibian_aircraft \"Amphibian aircraft\") capable of taking off and landing on water surfaces.
