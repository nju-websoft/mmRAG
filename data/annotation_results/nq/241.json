Wives are expected to run their\nhouseholds and wear blue, Marthas are housekeepers and cooks, Aunts train and\noversee the Handmaids, Eyes watch over the general populace for signs of\nrebellion, Hunters track down people attempting to flee the country, and\nJezebels are prostitutes.\n\nJune Osborne, renamed Offred ([Elisabeth Moss](/wiki/Elisabeth_Moss \"Elisabeth\nMoss\")), is the Handmaid assigned to the home of Gileadan Commander Fred\nWaterford ([Joseph Fiennes](/wiki/Joseph_Fiennes \"Joseph Fiennes\")) and his\nwife Serena Joy ([Yvonne Strahovski](/wiki/Yvonne_Strahovski \"Yvonne\nStrahovski\")). She is subject to the strictest rules and constant scrutiny; an\nimproper word or deed on her part can lead to brutal punishment. Offred, who\nis named after her male master like all Handmaids, can remember the \"time\nbefore\", when she was married with a daughter and had her own name and\nidentity, but all she can safely do now is follow the rules of Gilead in the\nhope that she can someday live free and be reunited with her daughter.

She is desperate to become a mother.\n  * [Alexis Bledel](/wiki/Alexis_Bledel \"Alexis Bledel\") as Emily/Ofglen, June's shopping partner. Although June is initially wary of her, it is revealed she is not as pious as she seems and the two become friends. She had a wife and son, and was a university lecturer in cellular biology. Being homosexual is punishable by death under Gilead and most university professors are sent to labor camps, but she was spared due to her fertility. She is later captured and punished for her relationship with a Martha, and is sent to another household where she becomes \"Ofsteven\". She is involved with a resistance movement called \"Mayday\".\n  * [Madeline Brewer](/wiki/Madeline_Brewer \"Madeline Brewer\") as Janine/Ofwarren, a handmaid who entered the Red Center for training at the same time as June, and considers June a friend due to her kind treatment.

She appears to have a soft spot for Janine, even going so far as to address her by her given name on occasion.\n  * [O. T. Fagbenle](/wiki/O._T._Fagbenle \"O. T. Fagbenle\") as Luke Bankole, June's husband from before Gilead. As June is his second wife, their union is considered invalid in the new society and Hannah is considered illegitimate.

She follows the rules and does not wish to upset the status quo, but this is because she believes her life as a handmaid to be better than the difficult, impoverished life she led prior to Gilead, rather than out of religious piety.\n  * Nina Kiri as Alma, another handmaid who trained at the Red Center with June, Moira and Janine. She is frank and chatty, often trading gossip and news with June. She is also involved with Mayday and becomes June's first contact with the resistance group.\n  * Jenessa Grant as Ofsamuel, a local handmaid with a friendly and talkative nature.\n  * Jordana Blake as Hannah Osborne, June's daughter.\n\n##\nEpisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Episodes\")]\n\nNo. | Title | Directed by | Teleplay by | Original release date  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | \"Offred\" | [Reed Morano](/wiki/Reed_Morano \"Reed Morano\") | [Bruce Miller](/wiki/Bruce_Miller_\\(producer\\) \"Bruce Miller \\(producer\\)\") | April 26, 2017 (2017-04-26)  \nA woman flees from a group of men with guns, but she is captured and separated\nfrom her young daughter; her husband has vanished. She is known as Offred, a\n[handmaid](/wiki/Handmaid \"Handmaid\") to Commander Fred Waterford. Offred goes\ngrocery shopping with her companion, Ofglen. On the way home, they pass by a\nwall of men who have been hanged for crimes such as being gay, working in an\nabortion clinic, being Jewish, and being Catholic.[7] In a flashback, various\nwomen are indoctrinated into the handmaid roles by Aunt Lydia, who tells them\nabout declining birth rates and that they are \"special\", serving a Biblical\npurpose. Offred enters the room and notices Moira, a woman she knew at\ncollege. One woman in the class, Janine, answers Lydia back and is shocked\nwith a cattle prod before having her right eye removed as punishment. In the\npresent, Commander Waterford tries to impregnate Offred as she lies in the lap\nof his wife, Serena Joy. The next day, the handmaids gather in an open field\nwhere Lydia announces a man has raped a pregnant handmaid. As punishment, the\nhandmaids are allowed to beat him to death. Janine tells Offred that Moira is\ndead. On the way home, Ofglen tells Offred that she had a wife and son and\nwarns her there is an Eye (a secret spy) in her house. Through voiceover,\nOffred reveals her true name, June, and that she intends to survive to find\nher daughter.  \n2 | \"Birth Day\" | Reed Morano | Bruce Miller | April 26, 2017 (2017-04-26)  \nOffred and Ofglen go shopping and they reveal more personal information about\nthemselves to each other. While they are walking, Offred and Ofglen see [St.\nPaul Catholic Church](/wiki/St._Paul_Church_\\(Cambridge,_Massachusetts\\) \"St.\nPaul Church \\(Cambridge, Massachusetts\\)\"), the [local\nchurch](/wiki/Local_church \"Local church\") they belonged to, being destroyed\nby the new régime.[8][7] Ofglen tells Offred that the régime also bulldozed\n[St. Patrick's Cathedral](/wiki/St._Patrick%27s_Cathedral_\\(Manhattan\\) \"St.\nPatrick's Cathedral \\(Manhattan\\)\") in Manhattan to try to \"erase\" the fact\nthat it ever existed; Offred asks how Ofglen knows this information and she\nreveals that she is part of a resistance against the government.[9] Ofglen\nasks her to join, but Offred declines. Nick, Commander Waterford's driver,\ntells Offred that the Commander wants to see her alone later that night, which\nis forbidden. Nick also warns her “Don't get too close to [Ofglen]. It's\ndangerous.” Offred and other handmaids go to a home to witness the birth of\nOfwarren's (formerly Janine's) child, named \"Angela\" by the Puttnams, but\n\"Charlotte\" by Ofwarren. In flashbacks, June remembers the birth of her own\ndaughter, Hannah. At that time healthy births were already rare, and a woman\ntried to kidnap Hannah but was arrested. Offred goes to the Commander's\noffice, unsure of what will happen, but he just wants to play\n_[Scrabble](/wiki/Scrabble \"Scrabble\")_. She laughs with relief when she\nreturns to her room. The next day, Offred prepares to tell Ofglen what\nhappened that night, but when she goes outside, it's a different woman who\nintroduces herself as Ofglen.  \n3 | \"Late\" | Reed Morano | Bruce Miller | April 26, 2017 (2017-04-26)  \nIn flashbacks, the rise of Gilead is detailed. June and all the other women at\nher office are fired because \"it's the law now\". June and Moira also learn\nthat the government has frozen all women's bank accounts and that they can no\nlonger own property. In the present, Serena takes Offred to see Ofwarren and\nthe baby. Offred fears Ofwarren is delusional and comments on her behaviour to\nSerena. Nick drives Offred home and there is a black van waiting. Offred is\ninterrogated by an Eye and Aunt Lydia about her knowledge of Ofglen. Offred\neventually reveals she knew Ofglen was gay and quotes one of the\n[Beatitudes](/wiki/Beatitudes \"Beatitudes\") from the [Bible](/wiki/Bible\n\"Bible\"); for this, Lydia shocks Offred with a cattle prod. Before she can\nleave the room, Offred responds by quoting the Bible back: “Blessed are those\nwho suffer for the cause of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of\nHeaven.” That would have earned her a much more serious beating but Serena\nintervenes, yelling at them to stop as she believes that Offred is pregnant.\nNick visits Offred in her room to check on her and they share an intimate\nmoment. Offred later tells Serena that she's not pregnant so Serena angrily\ndrags her to her room and loudly orders her not to come out. In a flashback,\nJune and Moira attend a protest against the new laws that is suppressed by\nautomatic gunfire and explosives. In the present, Ofglen and the Martha she's\nin a relationship with are charged with \"gender treachery\", with Ofglen\nreceiving a lesser sentence because she can still bear children. The Martha is\nexecuted by hanging as Ofglen watches, sobbing and horrified. Later, Ofglen\n(now referred to by her \"old\" name, Emily) wakes up in a clinic, having\nundergone [female genital mutilation](/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation \"Female\ngenital mutilation\") surgery as explained by Aunt Lydia. She then screams out\nof grief and anger.  \n4 | \"Nolite Te Bastardes Carborundorum\" | [Mike Barker](/wiki/Mike_Barker_\\(film_director\\) \"Mike Barker \\(film director\\)\") | [Leila Gerstein](/wiki/Leila_Gerstein \"Leila Gerstein\") | May 3, 2017 (2017-05-03)  \nOffred, who is banished to her room, goes into the closet where she finds the\nLatin phrase _Nolite Te Bastardes Carborundorum_ scratched into the wall.\nRita, the Commander's housekeeper, finds Offred lying in the closet but Offred\ntells her that she fainted. Believing she is ill, Serena has Offred sent to\nthe hospital for a check-up. While examining Offred, the physician remarks\nthat the Commander is sterile, because \"most of those guys are\". He offers to\nimpregnate her but she declines. In flashbacks, Aunt Lydia teaches the\nhandmaids (including June and Moira) about the \"Ceremony\": when the Commander\nrapes a handmaid. Later, June lures Aunt Elizabeth into the bathroom saying a\ntoilet has overflowed, and Moira threatens the Aunt with a shiv. June and\nMoira take her to the basement where Moira takes the Aunt's outfit and they\ntie her up. June and Moira begin their escape, hoping to leave via train to\nBoston, which has safehouses. When Moira is asking one of the guards for\ndirections, June is approached by another guard who is suspicious of her being\nalone. Moira gets on the train, leaving June behind, but June smiles at her to\nlet her know it's okay. June is later punished by having her [feet\nwhipped](/wiki/Foot_whipping \"Foot whipping\"). In the present, Commander\nWaterford has an unsuccessful Ceremony night with Offred. Later that night,\nthe Commander and Offred have another game of _Scrabble_ where she asks him\nabout the Latin phrase; he tells her it means \"Don't let the bastards grind\nyou down\". She also inquires about the previous Offred, in which he tells her\nthat she committed suicide because life was unbearable. He makes it known that\nhe doesn't want that to happen again and releases Offred from her solitary\nconfinement.  \n5 | \"Faithful\" | Mike Barker | Dorothy Fortenberry | May 10, 2017 (2017-05-10)  \nSerena suggests to Offred that she have sex with Nick in case Commander\nWaterford is sterile. Later that day, Serena leads Offred up to Nick's room\nwhere she waits by the door while they have detached, Ceremony-like sex.\nFlashbacks detail Luke and June's first meeting and courtship. At the grocery\nstore, Offred talks to the original Ofglen, now called Ofsteven, but she is\nnot as responsive as she used to be. During a Ceremony night, The Commander\ntouches Offred's thigh, which she later tells him never to do again. In their\nensuing conversation, the Commander admits that while they thought they were\nbuilding a better world, they knew that \"better never means better for\neveryone.\" Nick reveals to Offred that he is indeed an Eye. At an open-air\nmarket, Offred questions Ofsteven about the resistance group called \"Mayday\"\n(from the French, m'aidez meaning 'help me'). Ofsteven steals one of the\nguards' cars and proceeds to drive away; in the process, she kills a guard by\nrunning him over but she is caught and put into a van. Offred returns to\nNick's place alone later that night and they share an intimate night.  \n6 | \"A Woman's Place\" | [Floria Sigismondi](/wiki/Floria_Sigismondi \"Floria Sigismondi\") | Wendy Straker Hauser | May 17, 2017 (2017-05-17)  \nMexican delegates visit the Commander's home in an effort to create\npartnerships in trade and see the effects of the Gilead cultural movement. The\nhead of the Mexican delegation is a woman who questions Offred about her\nexperience in Gilead. With great self-control, Offred tells them, \"I have\nfound happiness\". After the meeting, Offred visits the Commander's office for\ntheir usual discussions where some tensions flare up between them. He asks her\nto kiss him \"like you mean it\". She kisses the Commander and leaves,\nferociously brushing her teeth afterwards. The handmaids are then taken to a\nparty to honour Gilead and show the foreign delegates their success, including\npresenting the children of Gilead. Offred's friend remarks that the delegates\nare interested in fertile women as a commodity to be traded between the two\nnations. The next day, as the delegates are leaving, Offred tells them the\nbrutal truth about Gilead. She pleads for their help, but the Mexican\nambassador claims that she cannot help Offred and explains her own country's\ndire situation. When Offred is left alone with the ambassador's assistant, he\nclaims her husband is alive and that he can send a message to him. Flashbacks\ndetail Serena and Fred's life before and during the beginnings of the Gilead\nmovement. Serena is revealed to have been a conservative cultural activist\nduring the \"life before\", with a passion and intelligence equal to that of her\nhusband's (as well as a special fondness for movie popcorn). She even wrote a\nbook about her beliefs, titled _A Woman 's Place_, which contained the famous\nline \"do not mistake a woman's meekness for weakness\". However, after the\ntakeover, she is shown to be completely shut out of the new government\nplanning (to Fred's dismay). Rather symbolically, as she prepares to accept\nher new limited role in the society she helped create, a copy of her book is\nseen being thrown out in the trash.  \n7 | \"The Other Side\" | Floria Sigismondi | Lynn Renee Maxcy | May 24, 2017 (2017-05-24)  \nThe episode chronicles the story of Luke after he is separated from his wife\nand daughter. Luke is shot by Gileadan guards and taken in an ambulance to be\ninterrogated. He escapes when the ambulance gets into an accident and he takes\nsome supplies with him. Evidence of the country's violent takeover is\neverywhere. After passing out from his wounds, he is awoken by a resistance\ngroup (viewed as \"undesirables\" by Gilead) who are traveling to Canada; these\nsurvivors included a Roman Catholic [nun](/wiki/Nun#Christianity \"Nun\"), an\nescaped handmaid, a homosexual man and a daughter of a US army soldier.[10]\nInitially reluctant, Luke joins them after one of the survivors, Zoe, shows\nhim that Gileadan authorities hanged local townspeople from the rafters of\ntheir [church](/wiki/Church_\\(building\\) \"Church \\(building\\)\") for\nresisting.[11][12] As they are boarding a boat, they are shot at by Gileadan\nguards, who kill several members of the group. Luke and one of the members, a\nmute blonde woman who was being trained as a handmaid, survive and flee.\nFlashbacks prior to Luke, June and their daughter Hannah being separated are\ndetailed. June and Luke get help from Mr. Whitford, a man who knew June's\nmother. He drives them safely out of town and drops them off at a secluded\ncabin in the woods. Luke and June wait as Mr. Whitford gets documentation for\nthem to escape to Canada. They are confronted by a hunter, who tells them\nWhitford has been caught and hanged. But the man says he can help them get\nover the border. Three years later, Luke and the mute blonde woman are living\nsafely in \"Little America\", based in [Toronto, Ontario](/wiki/Toronto,_Ontario\n\"Toronto, Ontario\"). Missing person flyers are posted everywhere in the main\nadministrative office. Luke receives the letter from June, which reads \"I love\nyou so much. Save Hannah.\"  \n8 | \"Jezebels\" | Kate Dennis | Kira Snyder | May 31, 2017 (2017-05-31)  \nCommander Waterford gifts Offred with makeup and a dress as he is taking her\nout for the night. Nick drives them to Boston to an underground\n[brothel](/wiki/Brothel \"Brothel\") where prostitutes known as \"Jezebels\" work.\nOffred spots Moira working in the club and they briefly reunite. Nick trades\ndrugs and pregnancy tests for alcohol with one of the brothel's Marthas.\nOffred goes to see Moira again, where she explains to Offred about how\n[Quakers](/wiki/Quakers \"Quakers\") tried to help her escape, but were\ncaught.[13][14] Moira had the choice of either being sent to the colonies or\none of the brothels.[14] Moira tells Offred, \"Forget about escaping. This is\nGilead. No one gets out.\" Offred reveals to Moira that she knows Luke is\nalive. Flashbacks detail how Nick got involved with the Gilead movement and\nhow he became an Eye after reporting a Commander for breaking protocol with\nhis handmaids. There are other flashbacks to the suicide of the previous\nOffred, with Serena pointedly saying to her husband, \"What did you _think_ was\ngoing to happen?\" In the present, after Nick drives Waterford and Offred home,\nhe ends his relationship with Offred, which upsets and angers her. Offred\nreceives a gift from Serena, a music box. The episode closes with Offred\netching \"You are not alone\" into the closet wall.  \n9 | \"The Bridge\" | Kate Dennis | Eric Tuchman | June 7, 2017 (2017-06-07)  \nOfwarren's daughter is presented to Commander Putnam and his wife. Offred is\nworried about Ofwarren's mental state but Aunt Lydia informs her that \"she's\ntougher than you think\". Ofwarren, now known as Ofdaniel, is taken to her new\nhome. During her first Ceremony night with her new Commander, Ofdaniel\nforcefully stops it and sobs. At the market, Alma pulls Offred aside and lets\nher know that she knows about the resistance group \"Mayday\". Alma tells her to\nretrieve a package from Jezebel's. Offred convinces Waterford to take her to\nJezebel's again that very night. After Offred and Waterford have sex in their\nroom, he presents Moira as he believes a sexual attraction between the two was\nthe reason Offred wanted to come back. Offred talks to Moira about having her\nretrieve the package from the bar, but she refuses, which angers Offred. Moira\nseems to have completely given up. Back at the house, Offred is awoken by\nSerena, who takes her to a bridge where Ofdaniel is standing on the edge with\nCharlotte. Various Gileadan guards, the Putnams, Waterfords, and Aunt Lydia\nare also present. Ofdaniel loudly accuses Commander Putnam of lying to her and\naccuses him of having promised to leave his wife for her. Offred is able to\nconvince Ofdaniel to give her the child but Ofdaniel jumps, attempting\nsuicide. She is pulled out by the guards and lies comatose in hospital with\nAunt Lydia by her side, who calls her \"stupid\". Commander Putnam is later seen\nbeing led into a black van by guards due to the accusations made by Ofdaniel.\nSerena Joy tries to offer comfort to Mrs. Putnam and offers help with the\nbaby, which she curtly refuses. Mrs. Putnam then reminds Serena of the first\nOffred, saying that \"men don't change\". Serena is seen going into Fred's\noffice. At the market, Offred is given a package by the butcher, sent by Moira\nfrom Jezebels. At the brothel, Moira kills a client and takes his clothes,\njubilantly driving off in his car.  \n10 | \"Night\" | [Kari Skogland](/wiki/Kari_Skogland \"Kari Skogland\") | Bruce Miller | June 14, 2017 (2017-06-14)  \nThis episode begins with a flashback to when June was first captured and sent\nto the red center, receiving her first indoctrination lesson from Aunt Lydia.\nSerena discovers the trips to Jezebel's and strikes Offred in anger before\nforcing her to take a pregnancy test, which is positive. Serena then directs\nher anger at her husband, telling him about the pregnancy and that the child\nis not his. She also says he is weak and that God would never allow him to\npass on that weakness. On learning the news, Nick shares a brief, tender\nmoment with Offred. Serena and Offred visit the house that Offred's daughter,\nHannah, now lives; Offred can see her daughter through a gate. While Serena\ndoes not allow Offred to reveal herself to Hannah, she assures her that she is\ndoing fine. Serena also warns Offred that as long as nothing bad happens to\nher child, nothing bad will happen to Hannah. Offred furiously curses Serena\nin a breathless rant, only to be told to be quiet; yelling is not good for the\nbaby. Fred participates in Commander Putnam’s trial: he himself is all for\nleniency but is told there have been too many occurrences of this kind of sin\nrecently and an example has to be made. Mrs. Putnam herself has asked that her\nhusband receive the harshest punishment possible, as she fears for his\nimmortal soul. Ultimately, Putnam's left hand is amputated. In the evening,\nOffred pleads with Fred to protect her daughter. He asks if he is the father\nof her child and she says \"of course\", to which he replies \"you do that so\nwell.\" Later, Fred is seen being quite gentle and conciliatory towards Serena.\nThe package from Jezebel's is revealed to contain letters from women who have\nlost family members and been enslaved in the Gilead takeover. Later, a\nsomewhat emotional Aunt Lydia gathers the handmaids for an execution: they are\nto stone someone who has endangered a child. The convict turns out to be\nJanine/Ofdaniel. The handmaids hesitate and Ofglen #2 is brutally beaten when\nshe breaks rank and voices her angry refusal. The other women, beginning with\nOffred, drop their stones, each saying \"I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia\" (a phrase they\nwere taught early in their indoctrination). The guards are ready to kill them\nall, but Aunt Lydia frantically tells them that the handmaids are her\nresponsibility. She tells the women to go home, assuring them that there will\nbe consequences. Not long after, a black van comes for Offred, much to Fred\nand Serena's surprise and indignation. Nick quietly urges her to trust him and\ngo with them. As she is being led out, Offred whispers to Rita where to find\nthe hidden letters. In a side story, Moira makes it to Canada and is reunited\nwith Luke.  \n  \n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nA straight-to-series order by Hulu of _The Handmaid 's Tale_ was announced in\nApril 2016, with [Elisabeth Moss](/wiki/Elisabeth_Moss \"Elisabeth Moss\") set\nto star.[15] Based on the 1985 novel of the same name by Margaret Atwood, the\nseries was created by Bruce Miller, who is also an executive producer with\nDaniel Wilson, Fran Sears, and [Warren Littlefield](/wiki/Warren_Littlefield\n\"Warren Littlefield\").[15] Atwood serves as [consulting\nproducer](/wiki/Television_producer#Types_of_television_producers \"Television\nproducer\"), giving feedback on some of the areas where the series expands or\nmodernizes the book.[15][16] She also co-wrote every episode[17] and also had\na small cameo role in the first episode.[18] Moss is also a producer.[19] In\nJune 2016, [Reed Morano](/wiki/Reed_Morano \"Reed Morano\") was announced as\ndirector of the series.[20] [Samira Wiley](/wiki/Samira_Wiley \"Samira Wiley\"),\n[Max Minghella](/wiki/Max_Minghella \"Max Minghella\"), and [Ann\nDowd](/wiki/Ann_Dowd \"Ann Dowd\") joined the cast in July 2016.[21][22][23]\n[Joseph Fiennes](/wiki/Joseph_Fiennes \"Joseph Fiennes\"), [Madeline\nBrewer](/wiki/Madeline_Brewer \"Madeline Brewer\") and [Yvonne\nStrahovski](/wiki/Yvonne_Strahovski \"Yvonne Strahovski\") were cast in August\n2016,[24][25][26] followed by [O.
