In _[The Vampire Diaries](/wiki/The_Vampire_Diaries \"The\nVampire Diaries\")_ , set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, she is\nportrayed by [Nina Dobrev](/wiki/Nina_Dobrev \"Nina Dobrev\"). In the books,\nElena was blonde, popular, selfish and a \"[mean girl](/wiki/Meanness\n\"Meanness\")\". However the show's producers, Julie Plec and [Kevin\nWilliamson](/wiki/Kevin_Williamson_\\(screenwriter\\) \"Kevin Williamson\n\\(screenwriter\\)\"), felt that it wasn't the direction they wanted to go with\ntheir heroine in _The Vampire Diaries_ television series. Instead, she became\na nicer, relatable and more of \"the girl next door\" type, until her life gets\nflipped upside down when she meets the Salvatores. In April 2015, Nina Dobrev\nannounced that she would be departing the series after the sixth season\nfinale.\n\nMuch of Elena's story revolves around her relationships with vampires [Stefan\nSalvatore](/wiki/Stefan_Salvatore \"Stefan Salvatore\") and his older brother,\n[Damon](/wiki/Damon_Salvatore \"Damon Salvatore\"). It is revealed that Elena is\na Petrova [Doppelgänger](/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger \"Doppelgänger\"), which is\nthus responsible for her being identical to her ancestor, [Katherine\nPierce](/wiki/Katherine_Pierce \"Katherine Pierce\") (née Katerina Petrova).\nThis also has the implication of making her a supernatural creature. Dobrev\nportrayed the \"conniving\" Katherine as well, who is opposite of Elena. The\nactress stated that it has been a challenge distinguishing the two, and enjoys\nplaying them both. In the television series's fourth season, Elena becomes a\nvampire and deals with the struggles that come with her change. She took the\ncure and became human again towards the end of the sixth season. In the finale\nof the sixth season, Kai linked Elena to Bonnie's life by magic. Elena will\nonly wake up when Bonnie dies in around 60 years. She was locked inside the\nSalvatore tomb, which was changed in the seventh season, and was relocated in\nBrooklyn, New York. In late 2016, when it was announced that the eighth season\nwould be the final season, Dobrev was in talks about returning to the\ntelevision series to reprise her role in the final episode. After much\nspeculation. Dobrev's return was confirmed on January 26, 2017, via an\n[Instagram](/wiki/Instagram \"Instagram\") post. Dobrev appeared in the final\nepisode of the show as both Elena and her evil doppelgänger Katherine Pierce.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Casting and portrayal\n  * 2 Development\n    * 2.1 Characterization\n    * 2.2 Romances\n    * 2.3 Transition\n  * 3 Television series\n    * 3.1 Backstory\n    * 3.2 Storyline\n      * 3.2.1 Season 1\n      * 3.2.2 Season 2\n      * 3.2.3 Season 3\n      * 3.2.4 Season 4\n      * 3.2.5 Season 5\n      * 3.2.6 Season 6\n      * 3.2.7 Season 7\n      * 3.2.8 Season 8\n  * 4 Reception\n  * 5 Merchandising\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Casting and\nportrayal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Casting and portrayal\")]\n\nWhen I look in the mirror, I just feel different when I'm Katherine or when\nI'm Elena. My voice changes a little bit, I think, and even just mentally, I\nfeel like I can get away with a lot more.[1]\n\n“\n\n”\n\n—Dobrev\n\nOn March 9, 2009, it was announced that [Bulgarian](/wiki/Bulgaria\n\"Bulgaria\")-born [Canadian](/wiki/Canadians \"Canadians\") actress Nina Dobrev,\nknown for her portrayal of [Mia\nJones](/wiki/Mia_Jones_\\(Degrassi:_The_Next_Generation\\) \"Mia Jones\n\\(Degrassi: The Next Generation\\)\") on _[Degrassi: The Next\nGeneration](/wiki/Degrassi:_The_Next_Generation \"Degrassi: The Next\nGeneration\")_ , had joined the cast of _The Vampire Diaries_ as Elena.[2] She\nwas the second cast member to be announced following [Steven R.\nMcQueen](/wiki/Steven_R._McQueen \"Steven R. McQueen\"), who plays Elena's\nbrother [Jeremy Gilbert](/wiki/Jeremy_Gilbert \"Jeremy Gilbert\").[3] Steve West\nCinema Blend said the vampire brothers' battle over Elena will wreak havoc on\nthe entire town.\".[2] Executive producer [Kevin\nWilliamson](/wiki/Kevin_Williamson_\\(screenwriter\\) \"Kevin Williamson\n\\(screenwriter\\)\") recalled Dobrev auditioning while having the flu, which he\ndescribed as the \"worst audition ever\", and they \"didn't even look at her a\nsecond time\". Dobrev went back home to Canada, yet, still wanting the part,\nshe submitted a videotape audition, which saw her cast as Elena Gilbert.[4]\n\nDobrev said that after reading the script, she was drawn to Elena because she\nwas \"this average girl who was damaged in many ways\".[5] Initially, she\nbelieved that she would be playing the \"bad girl\" Elena from the books, but\nthe show wanted to go in a different direction for the character.[4] After\nresearching, Dobrev discovered she would also play Elena's 534-year-old\nvampire [doppelgänger](/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger \"Doppelgänger\") [Katherine\nPierce](/wiki/Katherine_Pierce \"Katherine Pierce\") whose characteristics are\nthe \"complete opposite\".[5] Dobrev described this as \"one of the rarest,\ncoolest opportunities in television, to play two people on the same medium\".\nShe had confessed that she enjoys playing Katherine more than Elena.[5] Dobrev\nstated that she changes her appearance to distinguish Elena from her\ndoppelgänger, Katherine; \"Changing my hair helps me transform,\" she told\n_[Glamour](/wiki/Glamour_\\(magazine\\) \"Glamour \\(magazine\\)\")_.[6]\nAdditionally, she said \"I think I have one of the coolest characters on the\nshow — I get to play two completely different people on opposite sides of the\nspectrum and I just have so much fun doing it\".[4] Dobrev felt that her\nbiggest challenge on _The Vampire Diaries_ was distinguishing Katherine and\nElena, and found it \"interesting\" to create a whole new character.[1] In the\nnovels, Katherine originated from Germany. However, in the television series,\nshe is Bulgarian, as is Dobrev, who can speak the language fluently . Dobrev\nsaid, \"The writers heard me speaking Bulgarian to my mom on the phone while I\nwas on set one day. One thing led to the other and voila\".[7]\n\n## Development[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n###\nCharacterization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Characterization\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Nina_Dobrev_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg/170px-\nNina_Dobrev_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nina_Dobrev_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nina_Dobrev_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNina Dobrev, who plays Elena Gilbert, at PaleyFest 2014\n\nIn the books, Elena is considered \"one of the popular girls\" at her high\nschool and always gets \"anything she wants\".[8] [Executive\nproducer](/wiki/Executive_producer \"Executive producer\") of the television\nshow, Julie Plec, said the Elena from the books was \"really kind of selfish\".\nIn _The Vampire Diaries_ , Elena's \"selfishness\" in the books as a human was\nnever explored, because it \"didn't ever feel like a characteristic\" the show\nwanted for their heroine.[9] Plec said \"We kind of abandoned that queen-bee\npopular complex that in a lot of ways defined early Elena in the books\", while\nfeeling that Elena's actual flaw is her \"deep, deep connection to other\npeople\".[9] In the books, Elena had blonde hair, but has brown hair in the\ntelevision show.[10] Describing Elena from the books, Dobrev said she is \"one\nof those mean girls that gets what she wants, popular . . . and she's blonde\nand blue eyed\". Williamson told her that \"the angle we wanted to go for was\nthe relatable, nice, girl next door, who the audience roots for\".[4]\nKatherine, on the other hand, is penned as a \"conniving, narcissistic,\nbitch\".[4] Describing Elena years later, Dobrev said she evolved from a\n\"younger, naive, sad, young girl\" to a \"strong woman\".[1]\n\n### Romances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Romances\")]\n\nBefore _The Vampire Diaries_ , Elena dated [Matt\nDonovan](/wiki/List_of_The_Vampire_Diaries_characters#Matt_Donovan \"List of\nThe Vampire Diaries characters\") ([Zach Roerig](/wiki/Zach_Roerig \"Zach\nRoerig\")), who was unable to move past his feelings for her initially after\ntheir break-up.[11] Elena began dating [Stefan\nSalvatore](/wiki/Stefan_Salvatore \"Stefan Salvatore\") ([Paul\nWesley](/wiki/Paul_Wesley \"Paul Wesley\")), and later discovered he was a\nvampire.[12] As the episodes progressed, she developed a connection with\nStefan's adventurous brother [Damon Salvatore](/wiki/Damon_Salvatore \"Damon\nSalvatore\") ([Ian Somerhalder](/wiki/Ian_Somerhalder \"Ian Somerhalder\")), who\nconsumes human blood, unlike Stefan, who has an animal blood diet.[13]\nSpeaking about the different qualities Stefan and Damon bring to Elena, Dobrev\nsaid they have \"different qualities that are very appealing\", which combined\nmake \"the perfect man\". She said \"Stefan is committed and sweet and protective\nand loving, and Damon is spontaneous and crazy and fun and exciting\".[5]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/The_Vampire_Diaries_Cast_Comic-\nCon_2012.jpg/270px-The_Vampire_Diaries_Cast_Comic-\nCon_2012.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Vampire_Diaries_Cast_Comic-Con_2012.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Vampire_Diaries_Cast_Comic-Con_2012.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDobrev with her _Vampire Diaries_ co-stars [Paul Wesley](/wiki/Paul_Wesley\n\"Paul Wesley\") (Stefan) and [Ian Somerhalder](/wiki/Ian_Somerhalder \"Ian\nSomerhalder\") (Damon) at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International.\n\nAfter Elena became a vampire, she became sired to Damon and they slept\ntogether. According to Plec during an interview with [TVLine](/wiki/TVLine\n\"TVLine\"), Elena \"really believes what she feels is 100 percent genuine and\nreal\", and the couple \"wants to be together and realizes that they shouldn’t,\nyet really wants to. So what do they do?\"[14] Stefan became heartbroken,\nfeeling angry and betrayed, and lashed out at Damon and Elena.[15] In the\nseason 4 finale, an unsired Elena confirms that she is in love with Damon, and\nthe two kiss passionately. At the end of season 6, the two plan to become\nhuman, get married, and have children together, but their dream is abruptly\ncompromised by Kai, who puts Elena into a magical coma. Damon remains entirely\ndevoted to Elena throughout the remaining two seasons as Elena sleeps\npeacefully. In the season 8 finale, she is revealed to be happily married to\nDamon. Elena considers Damon to be the love of her life and her soulmate.\n\n### Transition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Transition\")]\n\nExecutive producers Julie Plec and [Kevin\nWilliamson](/wiki/Kevin_Williamson_\\(screenwriter\\) \"Kevin Williamson\n\\(screenwriter\\)\") agreed that in the book series, Elena was turned into a\nvampire too early, which was around page 200 of _The Awakening_.[16] Elena's\ntransition into a vampire was planned for two years. Plec said: \"That felt\nobviously too soon, and rushed, and we didn’t want to make a show about a\nteenage girl who instantly becomes a vampire. But we always knew that her\njourney would take her there eventually\".[16] At [the second\nseason](/wiki/The_Vampire_Diaries_\\(season_2\\) \"The Vampire Diaries \\(season\n2\\)\")'s conclusion, Elena was nearly turned into a vampire.[1] Dobrev was\nhappy that she wasn't, because she felt \"it would have been too soon\", and\nalso didn't think it was something Elena or she wanted.[1]\n\nIn [the show's third season](/wiki/The_Vampire_Diaries_\\(season_3\\) \"The\nVampire Diaries \\(season 3\\)\"), Elena has a [brain\nhemorrhage](/wiki/Brain_hemorrhage \"Brain hemorrhage\") which was initially\nthought to be a concussion, and begins to die.[17] In what was described by\nthe _[International Business Times](/wiki/International_Business_Times\n\"International Business Times\")_ as \"the moment Vampire Diaries fans have been\nwaiting for\", Elena had to choose whether to be driven to Damon or Stefan to\nsay goodbye to. At the time, Klaus was killed, meaning all vampires sprouting\nfrom his bloodline also die, which includes Damon and Stefan. She picks to say\ngoodbye to Stefan.[17] However, all these vampires end up surviving when Klaus\nnever really dies. To save her, Doctor Merideth Fell ([Torrey\nDeVitto](/wiki/Torrey_DeVitto \"Torrey DeVitto\")) fed Elena Damon's blood.\nRebekah Mikaelson kills Elena on Wickery Bridge, unaware of the vampire blood\nin her system. She woke up as a vampire at the end of the season.[17] _[The\nHollywood Reporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood Reporter\")_\ninterviewed Plec, and described her transition as \"monumental changes\" which\nwould have Elena in for a \"wild ride\". Plec said Elena becoming a vampire is\n\"an awakening of a person who is about to go through a lot of changes\", and\n\"she is going to evolve as a person and her relationships are going to evolve\naccordingly\".[18] While Stefan was afraid she would hurt someone, Damon\nthought it was inevitable and wanted to \"rip the band-aid off\".[18] Plec felt\nthat \"She’s, unfortunately, not getting the same advice from the two people\nshe values most in the world. It’s going to make it more difficult for\nher\",[18] while describing the situation as \"a whole new Elena and it’s a\nwhole new day. It’s a different dynamic between the three of them\nespecially\".[18]\n\n## Television\nseries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Television series\")]\n\n### Backstory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Backstory\")]\n\nElena Gilbert is born on June 22, 1992 in Mystic Falls,\n[Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\") to [John\nGilbert](/wiki/List_of_The_Vampire_Diaries_characters#John_Gilbert \"List of\nThe Vampire Diaries characters\") ([David Anders](/wiki/David_Anders \"David\nAnders\")) and [Isobel Flemming](/wiki/List_of_The_Vampire_Diaries_characters\n\"List of The Vampire Diaries characters\") ([Mia Kirshner](/wiki/Mia_Kirshner\n\"Mia Kirshner\")) while they were still in highschool. With the help of John's\nbrother Grayson, Isobel and John flee town days later, leaving Grayson and his\nwife Miranda to adopt Elena as their own. A doctor, Grayson fakes a birth\ncertificate so that it appeared Elena was his daughter with Miranda. The next\nyear, Miranda and Grayson had a child of their own, Jeremy Gilbert. Elena\ndates her childhood friend Matt Donovan, who was her first love. On 23 May\n2009, Elena is picked up by her mother and father after getting in a fight\nwith Matt while attending the party. The three of them later end up in a car\naccident, with their car driving off a bridge. Stefan Salvatore finds them,\nand saves Elena, but it was too late to save Grayson and Miranda, who died. It\nremained unknown for months who saved Elena, and it was considered a miracle\nthat she lived. Her relationship with Matt ended when they broke up.\n\n### Storyline[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Storyline\")]\n\n#### Season 1[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Season 1\")]\n\nElena, still empty after losing her parents, begins to fit back into school.\nShe meets a mysterious new student named Stefan Salvatore. They connect\ninstantly, and begin dating. She meets his older and malevolent brother,\nDamon. After researching, Elena realizes Stefan was alive in 1953. It is later\nrevealed that he is a 162-year-old vampire. Damon also begins falling for\nElena. After she and Stefan slept together, Elena finds a picture of a woman\nnamed Katherine Pierce who looks exactly like her. Stefan reveals that it is\nthe woman who made him and Damon feud 145 years ago, and the person who turned\nthem into vampires. He also told her that he is the person that saved her the\nnight of her parents death. At the end of season one, Elena discovers that\nGrayson and Miranda weren't her biological parents, and that a woman named\nIsobel and her uncle John, who she grew up hating, were.\n\n#### Season 2[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Season 2\")]\n\nIn season two, she learns that she is a Petrova doppelgänger, having an\nappearance just like Katherine Pierce, which means that she has to be\nsacrificed to release Klaus' werewolf side. The sacrifice later happens, but\nElena is saved, because John sacrificed himself for her after being put under\na spell by Bonnie. However, her aunt Jenna is turned into a vampire and, as\npart of the sacrifice, is killed by Klaus, leaving Elena without a guardian.\nIn the season two finale, while Damon is dying due to a werewolf bite, she\nforgives him for forcing her to drink his blood and kisses him with the\nthought that it might be Damon's last day, however Damon gets cured by\ndrinking Klaus' blood.\n\n#### Season 3[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Season 3\")]\n\nIn season three, Elena does everything in her power to make Stefan get his\nhumanity back, which was turned off by Klaus as payment for saving Damon from\na werewolf bite in the latter part of season two. Meanwhile, she grows closer\nto Damon while working together on saving Stefan and trying to defeat Klaus,\neventually even sharing a kiss. She later admits to Stefan that she has\nfeelings for Damon as well but that she never stopped loving Stefan. While in\nDenver together, Elena kisses Damon, later telling him that she doesn't know\nhow she feels about him. It is eventually revealed that Elena met Damon the\nnight of her parent's death, though he compelled her to forget. She eventually\nchooses Stefan in the season finale but before she can tell him, Elena drowns\nwhile having vampire blood in her system. During the last moments of season\nthree, she awakens as a vampire in transition.\n\n#### Season 4[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Season 4\")]\n\nIn season four, Elena is faced with the tough decision of whether to die or to\nfeed on human blood so she can fully transition into a vampire. Elena, after\nrealizing Stefan's desperation to keep her alive, decides to complete her\ntransition. Her relationship with Stefan ends, allowing her to begin a proper\nromance with Damon. Although, it is later revealed there is a sire bond\nbetween them. Sometime later whilst searching for the cure for vampirism,\nJeremy is fed to the immortal Silas by Katherine. As a result, Damon used the\nsire bond to convince her to turn off her humanity, due to her incredible\ngrief over losing her brother and the last remaining member of her family.\nElena became ruthless without her emotions, going on killing sprees and being\nvery hateful towards her friends. Towards the end of season four, Damon kills\nMatt in front of Elena to trigger her grief. After revealing that Matt had the\nGilbert Ring on, Elena's humanity was switched on and her emotions were\nfocused on hate towards Katherine for killing Jeremy. Season four ended with\nBonnie as a ghost after bringing Jeremy back to life and Elena fed Katherine\nthe cure for vampirism in a moment of desperation as she was about to be\nkilled. Elena had chosen Damon as the Salvatore that she loved.\n\n#### Season 5[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Season 5\")]\n\nIn season five, Elena starts at Whitmore College and is happy after spending\nthe summer with Damon. There she realises that Silas has taken Stefan's place\nand that Stefan is in that safe in a river constantly drowning. She and Damon\nthen find the safe, only to find a dead body there meaning that someone opened\nthe safe and Stefan is a Ripper again. However, Qyetsiyah had fried Stefan's\nbrain causing him to suffer amnesia. While trying to bring him back, they\nalmost kiss meaning that she still feels something for him. Qyetsiyah soon\nbrings back Stefan's memories and says that Elena and Stefan were always meant\nto be as the Universe had to unite the doppelgängers of Silas and Amara. This\nleaves Damon and Elena questioning their relationship. Later on she is\nkidnapped and experimented on by Wes Maxfield, and she learns that her father\nalso used to experiment on vampires. Later, when Katherine is about to die as\na result of all of her years catching up with her as a result of having the\ncure in her system, Katherine uses a spell and possesses Elena, a fact that\nher friends were initially unable to deduce. But once they did, they trapped\nKatherine and left her with no escape. Stefan stabbed her with the traveller\ndagger, but ghost Katherine reveals to Bonnie, shortly before trying to cross\ninto the Other Side, that she had injected Dr. Maxfield's enhanced\nripper/werewolf virus into Elena's body, infecting Elena. The gang is\neventually able to find an antidote. She unfortunately loses trust in Damon,\npartly because he killed her friend Aaron, so they break up, but realise they\ncannot survive being apart and get back together. Once Markos and his\ntraveller army begin to take over Mystic Falls, setting an anti-magic barrier\naround the town, the gang comes up with a plan to take out the travellers by\nkilling them all at the same time, overpowering the anchor to the Other Side\nAKA Bonnie and creating a possible way out of the now-collapsing Other Side.\nElena and Damon drive into the gas-filled Mystic Grill with most of the\ntravellers in it, blowing it up and killing most of the people in it,\nincluding Elena and Damon. She wakes up as a ghost and finds her body, sending\nher to Bonnie, where she passes to the Other Side, and she and many others are\nable to pass back to the land of the living afterwards. But the spell that\nallows this is broken before Damon passes back through, and as Bonnie is the\nanchor, she is a part of the Other Side and shall therefore disappear along\nwith it. This leaves the gang mourning the loss of Damon and Bonnie in the\nseason finale.\n\n#### Season 6[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Season 6\")]\n\nIn season six, Elena starts back at Whitmore, and is unable to set foot in her\nhometown. She is also unable to recover from Damon's death and starts lurking\nthe borders of Mystic Falls in order to grab civilians, drink their blood,\nthen compel them to forget, but as spirit magic no longer works in Mystic\nFalls, any of her victims who cross into the town remember the ordeal, putting\nher identity as a vampire at risk when one of her victims, Sarah, comes to\ntown. Elena begs Alaric to compel her to forget that she ever loved Damon,\nwhich Alaric is able to do, due to him being an Enhanced Original, with the\nability to compel other vampires. She eventually wears him down and asks her\nfriends to never remind her once the compulsion had been done. After a number\nof failed attempts, Alaric successfully compels her to forget her love for\nDamon. She however leaves Alaric with some of her reminders of Damon, should\nshe ever need them again. She is told of her former feelings for Damon soon\nafterwards, but decides to stay the way she is, as she doesn't want to go back\nto being unhappy again. She starts to date her classmate, Liam. Once Damon\ncomes back to life, Alaric tries to convince Elena to allow him to undo the\ncompulsion, a decision she is reluctant to make. She eventually decides to\nhave him undo it, but Alaric goes back to being human again after crossing\ninto Mystic Falls, causing him to lose his vampire status (he only stayed\nalive because his once fatal human injuries were healed), meaning he will not\nbe able to do so. She is then left to finally come face-to-face with Damon and\nsee if she'll still feel the same way about him. They eventually rekindle\ntheir relationship,Elena takes the cure that Bonnie gave Damon. At Alaric's\nwedding Kai ruins their wedding and casts a sleeping spell on Elena, linking\nher life to Bonnie's. She makes a sacrifice to let Bonnie live out her life\nuntil it is her turn. She bids goodbye to her friends and loved ones before\nparting ways but knows that she will see Damon, Stefan and Caroline again one\nday.\n\n#### Season 7[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Season 7\")]\n\nElena doesn't make an appearance but is heard calling Damon's name when he\nvisits the Armory vault.

When a weakened Bonnie dies\nfrom the sounding bell, she meets Elena in a dream-like forest. Elena hugs her\nand wonders if she really has died. Enzo appears and says it isn't her time\nand takes Bonnie back to the world of the living. When Bonnie wakes up, it was\nStefan who resuscitated her. Elena, asleep, is then taken to the Mystic Falls\nHigh School by Katherine and places her in the boiler room. Stefan tries to\nrescue Elena, but Katherine had Kai spell the boiler room, so that Elena can't\nbe taken out of the room. After Bonnie had deflected the hellfire back into\nthe bell, Bonnie passes out. Elena wakes up and wanders the school. Stefan\nmeets up with her. It looks like Bonnie has died, but in fact Elena is still\nsleeping and Stefan's ghost came to visit her in her dream. He had taken the\nplace of killing Katherine instead of Damon, since Damon is human after Stefan\ngave him the cure. He came to say goodbye. After a tearful hug and saying\ngoodbye, Stefan goes into afterlife. Elena finally wakes up because Bonnie has\nbroken the spell over her. Elena reunites with Damon and the rest of the gang.\nElena gives Caroline the message Stefan whispered into her ear, saying he did\nhear her voice message and will love her forever. In the epilogue, Elena\ncontinued to studying medical school. After finishing her education, she went\nback to Mystic Falls and lived together with Damon, happily married for a long\ntime. After living out her life, she crosses over to the afterlife where she\nfinally reunites with her parents, Aunt Jenna and Uncle John.\n\n## Reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nElena has received mainly positive reviews. Steve West of the Cinema Blend\ncompared the story of _The Vampire Diaries_ and the character of Elena to the\npopular vampire franchise, _[Twilight](/wiki/Twilight_\\(2008_film\\) \"Twilight\n\\(2008 film\\)\")_ , and its protagonist [Bella Swan](/wiki/Bella_Swan \"Bella\nSwan\"). West said \"Clearly Elena is way hotter than Bella, she has two\nimmortal vampires fighting over her\".[2] After she transitioned into a\nvampire, Carina Adly MacKenzie of [Zap2it](/wiki/Zap2it \"Zap2it\") hoped that\nthe \"fierce\" and \"ripper\" side of Elena would emerge when \"someone messes with\nthe people she loves\".[19] McKenzie noted that when a person becomes a\nvampire, \"their strongest personality traits are heightened\", and hoped that\nwouldn't see Elena's \"compassion and selflessness\" double into \"helping old\nladies with their groceries and nursing injured animals back to health\".[19]\nRobyn Ross of _[TV Guide](/wiki/TV_Guide \"TV Guide\")_ also hoped that after\nElena \"has had a taste for blood\", she would lose control. Prior to her\nbecoming a vampire, Ross thought she was less fun and \"slightly boring\", and\nwanted Elena to follow her instinct and \"stop protecting everyone's\nfeelings\".[20]\n\nElena's romances with Stefan and Damon have become a popular craze with\nviewers, who have nicknamed them \"Stelena\" and \"Delena\".[21] Andy Swift of the\nwebsite [HollywoodLife](/wiki/HollywoodLife \"HollywoodLife\") praised Elena's\nrelationship with Damon, which was a combination of real love and a sired\nbond, hoping they would live \"happily ever after\".[21] Vlada Gelman of\n[TVLine](/wiki/TVLine \"TVLine\"), however, felt that their romance was \"over in\na rather mature way for a young love triangle\" and questioned whether Elena\nwas \"ready to jump into a relationship with Damon right away\" while Stefan was\nstill in the picture.[22]\n\n##\nMerchandising[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Merchandising\")]\n\n[Tonner Doll Company, Inc.](/wiki/Tonner_Doll_Company,_Inc. \"Tonner Doll\nCompany, Inc.\") created dolls for Elena and Katherine along with Stefan and\nDamon, from 1864.[23][24]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elena_Gilbert&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ Vestal, Shannon (25 July 2011).
