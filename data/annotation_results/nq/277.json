Ford claims that nearly 94\npercent energy recovery is achieved by first delivering full regenerative\nbraking followed by friction brakes during city driving.[20] Under ideal\nconditions, Ford claims the Fusion Hybrid can cruise 2 miles (3.2 km) at up to\n47 miles per hour (76 km/h) on battery power alone.[26]\n\nOnce perceived as a laggard in hybrid technology, Ford now claims nearly 500\nhybrid patents that allow the Fusion Hybrid to achieve 41 MPG on the highway.\nAccording to Hybridcars.com, Ford has pointed to its talented inventors,\nmaking \"special mention of Ming Kuang who has helped Ford since 2000 to expand\nits portfolio of hybrid patents from just 10 patents when he began to 461\ntoday.\" Quoted in Autotrader.com, the veteran engineer says \"it's about\nhelping make the world my children live in-and the world my children's\nchildren will live in-a better place.\"\n\n### Safety[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ford_Fusion_Hybrid&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Safety\")]\n\nThe [Ford Fusion](/wiki/Ford_Fusion_\\(Americas\\) \"Ford Fusion \\(Americas\\)\")\nline-up was included in the [Insurance Institute for Highway\nSafety](/wiki/Insurance_Institute_for_Highway_Safety \"Insurance Institute for\nHighway Safety\") 2010 \"Top Safety Pick's\" rating for the [mid-size](/wiki/Mid-\nsize_car \"Mid-size car\") category.[27][28] As of June 2010, Ford Fusion and\nMercury Milan hybrids are the only two mid-size hybrid vehicles in the\nlist.[29] Due to the fact that [Ford](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company \"Ford Motor\nCompany\") recently modified and strengthened the roof structure of the Flex,\nFusion, and MKT vehicles, these 2010 ratings apply only to [Lincoln\nMKZs](/wiki/Lincoln_MKZ \"Lincoln MKZ\"), [Mercury Milan](/wiki/Mercury_Milan\n\"Mercury Milan\") and Fusions built after April 2010.[27]\n\n### Fuel economy and environmental\nperformance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ford_Fusion_Hybrid&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Fuel economy and environmental performance\")]\n\nThe [U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency](/wiki/U.S._Environmental_Protection_Agency \"U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency\") (EPA) has rated the [fuel\neconomy](/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles \"Fuel economy in automobiles\") for\nthe 2010 Fusion Hybrid at 41 miles per US gallon (5.7 L/100 km; 49 mpg‑imp)\ncity, 36 miles per US gallon (6.5 L/100 km; 43 mpg‑imp) highway.[30] The\nfollowing table compares [fuel economy](/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles\n\"Fuel economy in automobiles\"), [carbon footprint](/wiki/Carbon_footprint\n\"Carbon footprint\"), and petroleum consumption between the hybrid version and\nother [drivetrains](/wiki/Powertrain \"Powertrain\") of the Fusion family as\nestimated by the EPA and the [U.S. Department of\nEnergy](/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Energy \"U.S. Department of Energy\"):\n\nEconomic and environmental performance comparison among  \nthe several Fusion powertrains available in the U.S. market  \n---  \nType of  \n[Powertrain](/wiki/Powertrain \"Powertrain\") | Type of  \nfuel | Year  \nmodel | [EPA](/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency \"United States Environmental Protection Agency\")  \nCity  \n[mileage](/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles \"Fuel economy in automobiles\")  \n([mpg](/wiki/Miles_per_gallon \"Miles per gallon\")) | EPA  \nHighway  \n[mileage](/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles \"Fuel economy in automobiles\")  \n([mpg](/wiki/Miles_per_gallon \"Miles per gallon\")) | Annual  \nfuel  \ncost (1) (2)  \n(USD) | [Carbon  \nfootprint](/wiki/Carbon_footprint \"Carbon footprint\")  \n(Ton/yr  \nof [CO2) (3)](/wiki/Carbon_Dioxide \"Carbon Dioxide\") | Annual  \nPetroleum  \nUse  \n([barrel](/wiki/Barrel_\\(unit\\)#Oil_barrel \"Barrel \\(unit\\)\"))  \n[Hybrid electric](/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle \"Hybrid electric vehicle\")\n[FWD](/wiki/Front-wheel_drive \"Front-wheel drive\")  \nAutomatic (variable gear ratios), 4 cyl, 2.5L[31] | Gasoline | 2011 | 41 | 36 | $1,083 | 4.8 | 8.8  \n[FWD](/wiki/Front-wheel_drive \"Front-wheel drive\") Automatic 6-spd, 4 cyl, 2.5L[32] | Gasoline | 2011 | 23 | 33 | $1,629 | 7.2 | 13.2  \n[FWD](/wiki/Front-wheel_drive \"Front-wheel drive\") Automatic (S6), 6 cyl, 3.0L[33] | Gasoline | 2011 | 20 | 28 | $1,840 | 8.1 | 14.9  \n[E85](/wiki/E85 \"E85\") [flex-fuel](/wiki/Flex-fuel \"Flex-fuel\") | 2011 | 14 | 21 | $2,269 | 6.6 | 5.0  \n[FWD](/wiki/Front-wheel_drive \"Front-wheel drive\") Automatic (S6), 6 cyl, 3.5L[34] | Gasoline | 2011 | 18 | 27 | $2,013 | 8.9 | 16.3  \n[AWD](/wiki/Four-wheel_drive \"Four-wheel drive\") Automatic (S6), 6 cyl, 3.0L[35] | Gasoline | 2011 | 18 | 26 | $2,115 | 9.3 | 17.1  \n[E85](/wiki/E85 \"E85\") [flex-fuel](/wiki/Flex-fuel \"Flex-fuel\") | 2011 | 13 | 19 | $2,421 | 7.1 | 5.3  \nNotes: (1) Estimates assumes 45% highway driving, 55% city driving, and 15,000\nannual miles.

The largest discrepancy the magazine\nhas previously found was 7 and 6 mpg for the [Toyota Prius\nc](/wiki/Toyota_Prius_c \"Toyota Prius c\") and the [Prius\nhatchback](/wiki/Toyota_Prius_\\(XW30\\) \"Toyota Prius \\(XW30\\)\"),\nrespectively.[74][76]\n\nA few days later the Environmental Protection Agency said it will review\nclaims that two new Ford hybrid vehicles are not delivering the advertised 47\nmpg. Linc Wehrly, Director of Light-duty Vehicle Center Compliance Division at\nEPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in [Ann Arbor,\nMichigan](/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan \"Ann Arbor, Michigan\") commented that\nhybrids have far more variability in miles per gallon than a conventional\nvehicle. Most vehicles' real-world gasoline mileage is less than the EPA\nsticker number, and can often be 20% less than the sticker number depending on\nspeed, temperature and other factors. The EPA explained that with hybrids the\ngap is much wider, as high as a 30% drop.[77] Ford responded in a statement,\nsaying that, \"_Early C-MAX Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid customers praise the\nvehicles and report a range of fuel economy figures, including some reports\nabove 47 mpg. This reinforces the fact that driving styles, driving\nconditions, and other factors can cause mileage to vary_.\"[76][77] A Ford\nspokesman also said they followed EPA's test guidelines and the company is\nstanding by the ratings as determined by the current testing protocols.\nNevertheless, they are working closely with the agency to determine if any\nchanges are needed for the industry relative to hybrid vehicle\ntesting.[78][79]\n\nIn July 2013, Ford issued a voluntary software update for the 2013 model year\nFusion, C-Max and MKZ Hybrid, that attempts to improve on the lower-than-\nexpected MPG claims.[80] Some of the changes include:\n\n  * Increasing the maximum pure electric speed from 62 to 85 mph (100 to 137 km/h), allowing increased use of electric-only mode on the highway\n  * Optimizing the use of Active Grille Shutters to reduce aerodynamic drag under more driving and temperature conditions including cold weather, during air conditioner use and when the engine coolant temperature is higher\n  * Reducing the electric fan speed as a function of coolant temperature to minimize the fan’s energy consumption\n  * Shortening engine warm-up time by up to 50 percent to enable electric-only driving and engine shutdown at stops sooner after cold starts\n  * Optimizing the climate control system to minimize use of the air conditioning compressor and reduce the energy used in cold weather operation.\n\nIn August 2013, and due to the criticism and after several lawsuits about the\nworse-than-expected fuel economy, Ford voluntarily lowered all three EPA\nratings of the C-Max Hybrid and will pay about a rebate to some 32,000 C-Max\nowners. The revised fuel economy ratings for combined was lowered from to 47\nto 45 mpg‑US (5.0 to 5.2 L/100 km; 56 to 54 mpg‑imp). Ford has no plans to\nchange the fuel economy ratings on the 2013 Fusion hybrid, because the company\nused the Fusion hybrid test to generate the fuel economy label for the C-Max\nHybrid following EPA's rules.[81]\n\n## Ford Fusion\nEnergi[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ford_Fusion_Hybrid&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Ford Fusion Energi\")]\n\nFord Fusion Energi  \n---  \n[![Ford Fusion Energi SEL with badge WAS 2012\n0583.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Ford_Fusion_Energi_SEL_with_badge_WAS_2012_0583.jpg/280px-\nFord_Fusion_Energi_SEL_with_badge_WAS_2012_0583.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ford_Fusion_Energi_SEL_with_badge_WAS_2012_0583.jpg)  \nOverview  \nManufacturer | [Ford Motor Company](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company \"Ford Motor Company\")  \nProduction | January 2013—present  \n[Model years](/wiki/Model_year \"Model year\") | 2013—present  \nBody and chassis  \n[Class](/wiki/Car_classification \"Car classification\") | [Mid-size car](/wiki/Mid-size_car \"Mid-size car\")  \n[Body style](/wiki/Car_classification \"Car classification\") | 4-door [sedan](/wiki/Sedan_\\(automobile\\) \"Sedan \\(automobile\\)\")  \n[Platform](/wiki/Automobile_platform \"Automobile platform\") | [Ford CD4 platform](/wiki/Ford_CD4_platform \"Ford CD4 platform\")  \nRelated | [Ford C-Max Energi](/wiki/Ford_C-Max_Energi \"Ford C-Max Energi\")  \nPowertrain  \n[Engine](/wiki/Engine \"Engine\") | 105 kW (141 hp) 2.0L [I4](/wiki/Inline-four_engine \"Inline-four engine\") gasoline[82]  \n[Electric motor](/wiki/Electric_motor \"Electric motor\") | 88 kW (118 hp)[82]  \n[Battery](/wiki/Electric_vehicle_battery \"Electric vehicle battery\") | 7.6 [kWh](/wiki/KWh \"KWh\") [lithium-ion](/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery \"Lithium-ion battery\")[82]  \n[Electric range](/wiki/All-electric_range \"All-electric range\") | **[MY](/wiki/Model_year \"Model year\") 2017**  \n22 mi (35 km) (EPA)[83][84]  \n**MY 2013/2016**  \n20 mi (32 km) (EPA)[6]  \n  \nThe Fusion Energi is a [plug-in hybrid](/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid \"Plug-in hybrid\")\nunveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show,[61] and retail\nsales in the U.S. began in February 2013.[2] Initially it was priced at\nUS$39,495, and in January 2014 the starting price was reduced to\nUS$35,525.[85][86] Due to the capacity of its battery pack, the Energi\nqualifies for a [federal tax credit](/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-\nin_electric_vehicles#Federal_government \"Government incentives for plug-in\nelectric vehicles\") up to US$3,750 and [any applicable state and local\nincentives](/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-\nin_electric_vehicles#Other_states \"Government incentives for plug-in electric\nvehicles\").[85] Energi models purchased in or after 2010 are eligible for a\n$4,007 tax credit, which is based on the capacity of the battery used to fuel\nthe vehicle.[87] The 2013 Fusion Energi is eligible for access to California’s\n[high-occupancy vehicle lanes](/wiki/High-occupancy_vehicle_lanes \"High-\noccupancy vehicle lanes\") (HOV) with a solo driver, and also for a US$1,500\nCalifornia state tax rebate.[88]\n\nA refreshed 2017 Fusion Energi is scheduled to be released by mid-2016.
