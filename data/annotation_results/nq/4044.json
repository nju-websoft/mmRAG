A galvanometer works as\nan [actuator](/wiki/Actuator \"Actuator\"), by producing a rotary deflection (of\na \"pointer\"), in response to electric current flowing through a\n[coil](/wiki/Electromagnetic_coil \"Electromagnetic coil\") in a constant\n[magnetic field](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic field\"). Early galvanometers\nwere not calibrated, but their later developments were used as measuring\ninstruments, called [ammeters](/wiki/Ammeter \"Ammeter\"), to measure the\ncurrent flowing through an electric circuit.\n\nGalvanometers developed from the observation that the needle of a [magnetic\ncompass](/wiki/Magnetic_compass \"Magnetic compass\") is deflected near a wire\nthat has electric current flowing through it, first described by [Hans\nOersted](/wiki/Hans_Oersted \"Hans Oersted\") in 1820. They were the first\ninstruments used to detect and measure small amounts of electric currents.\n[André-Marie Ampère](/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re \"André-Marie Ampère\"),\nwho gave mathematical expression to Ørsted's discovery and named the\ninstrument after[1] the Italian electricity researcher [Luigi\nGalvani](/wiki/Luigi_Galvani \"Luigi Galvani\"), who in 1791 discovered the\nprinciple of the [frog galvanoscope](/wiki/Frog_galvanoscope \"Frog\ngalvanoscope\") – that electric current would make the legs of a dead frog\njerk.\n\nSensitive galvanometers have been essential for the development of science and\ntechnology in many fields. For example, they enabled long range communication\nthrough submarine cables, such as the earliest [Transatlantic telegraph\ncables](/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable \"Transatlantic telegraph cable\"),\nand were essential to discovering the electrical activity of the\n[heart](/wiki/Electrical_conduction_system_of_the_heart \"Electrical conduction\nsystem of the heart\") and [brain](/wiki/Brain#Electrical_activity \"Brain\"), by\ntheir fine measurements of current.\n\nGalvanometers also had widespread use as the visualising part in other kinds\nof analog meters, for example in [light meters](/wiki/Light_meter \"Light\nmeter\"), [VU meters](/wiki/VU_meter \"VU meter\"), etc., where they were used to\nmeasure and display the output of other [sensors](/wiki/Sensor \"Sensor\").\nToday the main type of galvanometer mechanism, still in use, is the moving\ncoil, [D'Arsonval/Weston](/wiki/D%27Arsonval_galvanometer \"D'Arsonval\ngalvanometer\") type.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Operation\n  * 2 Uses\n    * 2.1 Modern uses\n    * 2.2 Past uses\n  * 3 History\n    * 3.1 Hans Oersted\n    * 3.2 Schweigger and Ampère\n    * 3.3 Poggendorff and Thomson\n    * 3.4 Georg Ohm\n    * 3.5 D'Arsonval and Deprez\n    * 3.6 Edward Weston\n  * 4 Types\n    * 4.1 Tangent galvanometer\n      * 4.1.1 Theory\n      * 4.1.2 Geomagnetic field measurement\n    * 4.2 Astatic galvanometer\n    * 4.3 Mirror galvanometer\n    * 4.4 Ballistic galvanometer\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Operation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Operation\")]\n\n[![Diagram of D'Arsonval/Weston type\ngalvanometer.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Galvanometer_scheme.svg/320px-\nGalvanometer_scheme.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Galvanometer_scheme.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Galvanometer_scheme.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDiagram of D'Arsonval/Weston type galvanometer. As the current flows from\n**+** through the coil (the orange part) to **−** , a magnetic field is\ngenerated in the coil. This field is counteracted by the permanent magnet and\nforces the coil to twist, moving the pointer, in relation to the field's\nstrength caused by the flow of current.\n\nModern galvanometers, of the D'Arsonval/Weston type, are constructed with a\nsmall pivoting coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet. The coil is\nattached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale. A tiny torsion\nspring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position.\n\nWhen a [direct current](/wiki/Direct_current \"Direct current\") (DC) flows\nthrough the coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. This field acts against\nthe permanent magnet. The coil twists, pushing against the spring, and moves\nthe pointer. The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current.\nCareful design of the pole pieces ensures that the magnetic field is uniform,\nso that the angular deflection of the pointer is proportional to the current.\nA useful meter generally contains provision for damping the mechanical\nresonance of the moving coil and pointer, so that the pointer settles quickly\nto its position without [oscillation](/wiki/Oscillation \"Oscillation\").\n\nThe basic sensitivity of a meter might be, for instance, 100\n[microamperes](/wiki/Ampere \"Ampere\") full scale (with a voltage drop of, say,\n50 millivolts at full current). Such meters are often calibrated to read some\nother quantity that can be converted to a current of that magnitude. The use\nof current dividers, often called [shunts](/wiki/Shunt_\\(electrical\\) \"Shunt\n\\(electrical\\)\"), allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents.\nA meter can be calibrated as a DC voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is\nknown by calculating the voltage required to generate a full scale current. A\nmeter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage\ndivider circuit. This is generally done by placing a [resistor](/wiki/Resistor\n\"Resistor\") in series with the meter coil. A meter can be used to read\n[resistance](/wiki/Electrical_resistance \"Electrical resistance\") by placing\nit in series with a known voltage (a battery) and an adjustable resistor. In a\npreparatory step, the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to\nproduce full scale deflection. When an unknown resistor is placed in series in\nthe circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately\ncalibrated scale can display the value of the previously unknown resistor.\n\nThese capabilities to translate different kinds of electric quantities, in to\npointer movements, make the galvanometer ideal for turning output of other\nsensors that outputs electricity (in some form or another), into something\nthat can be read by a human.\n\nBecause the pointer of the meter is usually a small distance above the scale\nof the meter, [parallax](/wiki/Parallax \"Parallax\") error can occur when the\noperator attempts to read the scale line that \"lines up\" with the pointer. To\ncounter this, some meters include a mirror along the markings of the principal\nscale. The accuracy of the reading from a mirrored scale is improved by\npositioning one's head while reading the scale so that the pointer and the\nreflection of the pointer are aligned; at this point, the operator's eye must\nbe directly above the pointer and any [parallax](/wiki/Parallax \"Parallax\")\nerror has been minimized.\n\n## Uses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Uses\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/DynAXIS_L.jpg/220px-\nDynAXIS_L.jpg)](/wiki/File:DynAXIS_L.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:DynAXIS_L.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nModern closed-loop galvanometer-driven laser scanning mirror from Scanlab.\n\nProbably the largest use of galvanometers was of the D'Arsonval/Weston type\nused in analog meters in electronic equipment. Since the 1980s, galvanometer-\ntype analog meter movements have been displaced by [analog to digital\nconverters](/wiki/Analog_to_digital_converter \"Analog to digital converter\")\n(ADCs) for many uses. A digital panel meter (DPM) contains an analog to\ndigital converter and numeric display. The advantages of a digital instrument\nare higher precision and accuracy, but factors such as power consumption or\ncost may still favour application of analog meter movements.\n\n### Modern uses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Modern uses\")]\n\nMost modern uses for the galvanometer mechanism are in positioning and control\nsystems. Galvanometer mechanisms are divided into moving magnet and moving\ncoil galvanometers; in addition, they are divided into _closed-loop_ and\n_open-loop_ \\- or _resonant_ \\- types.\n\n_Mirror_ galvanometer systems are used as beam positioning or beam steering\nelements in [laser scanning systems](/wiki/Laser_scanning \"Laser scanning\").\nFor example, for material processing with high-power lasers, closed loop\nmirror galvanometer mechanisms are used with [servo](/wiki/Servomechanism\n\"Servomechanism\") control systems. These are typically high power\ngalvanometers and the newest galvanometers designed for beam steering\napplications can have frequency responses over 10 kHz with appropriate servo\ntechnology. Closed-loop mirror galvanometers are also used in similar ways in\n[stereolithography](/wiki/Stereolithography \"Stereolithography\"), [laser\nsintering](/wiki/Direct_metal_laser_sintering \"Direct metal laser sintering\"),\n[laser engraving](/wiki/Laser_engraving \"Laser engraving\"), [laser beam\nwelding](/wiki/Laser_beam_welding \"Laser beam welding\"), [laser\nTVs](/wiki/Laser_TV \"Laser TV\"), [laser displays](/wiki/Laser_display \"Laser\ndisplay\") and in imaging applications such as retinal scanning with [Optical\nCoherence Tomography](/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography \"Optical coherence\ntomography\") (OCT). Almost all of these galvanometers are of the moving magnet\ntype. The closed loop is obtained measuring the position of the rotating axis\nwith an infrared emitter and 2 photodiodes. This feedback is an analog signal.\n\nOpen loop, or resonant mirror galvanometers, are mainly used in some types of\nlaser-based bar-code scanners, printing machines, imaging applications,\nmilitary applications and space systems. Their non-lubricated bearings are\nespecially of interest in applications that require functioning in a high\n[vacuum](/wiki/Vacuum \"Vacuum\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Autoexpmeter.JPG/320px-\nAutoexpmeter.JPG)](/wiki/File:Autoexpmeter.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Autoexpmeter.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA galvanometer mechanism (center part), used in an automatic exposure unit of\nan [8 mm film](/wiki/8_mm_film \"8 mm film\") [camera](/wiki/Movie_camera \"Movie\ncamera\"), together with a [photoresistor](/wiki/Photoresistor \"Photoresistor\")\n(seen in the hole on top of the leftpart).\n\nMoving coil type galvanometer mechanisms (called 'voice coils' by hard disk\nmanufacturers) are used for controlling the _head positioning_ servos in [hard\ndisk drives](/wiki/Hard_disk_drive \"Hard disk drive\") and CD/DVD players, in\norder to keep mass (and thus access times), as low as possible.\n\n### Past uses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Past uses\")]\n\nA major early use for galvanometers was for finding faults in\ntelecommunications cables. They were superseded in this application late in\nthe 20th century by [time-domain reflectometers](/wiki/Time-\ndomain_reflectometer \"Time-domain reflectometer\").\n\nGalvanometer mechanisms were also used to get readings from\n[photoresistors](/w/index.php?title=Photoresistors&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Photoresistors \\(page does not exist\\)\") in the metering mechanisms of film\ncameras (as seen in the adjacent image).\n\nIn analog strip [chart recorders](/wiki/Chart_recorder \"Chart recorder\") such\nas used in [electrocardiographs](/wiki/Electrocardiograph\n\"Electrocardiograph\"), [electroencephalographs](/wiki/Electroencephalography\n\"Electroencephalography\") and [polygraphs](/wiki/Polygraph \"Polygraph\"),\ngalvanometer mechanisms were used to position the _pen_. Strip chart recorders\nwith galvanometer driven pens may have a full scale frequency response of 100\nHz and several centimeters of deflection.\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n### Hans Oersted[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Hans Oersted\")]\n\nThe deflection of a [magnetic compass](/wiki/Magnetic_compass \"Magnetic\ncompass\") needle by current in a wire was first described by [Hans\nOersted](/wiki/Hans_Oersted \"Hans Oersted\") in 1820. The phenomenon was\nstudied both for its own sake and as a means of measuring electric current.\n\n### Schweigger and\nAmpère[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Schweigger and Ampère\")]\n\nThe earliest galvanometer was reported by [Johann\nSchweigger](/wiki/Johann_Salomo_Christoph_Schweigger \"Johann Salomo Christoph\nSchweigger\") at the [University of Halle](/wiki/University_of_Halle\n\"University of Halle\") on 16 September 1820. [André-Marie\nAmpère](/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re \"André-Marie Ampère\") also\ncontributed to its development. Early designs increased the effect of the\nmagnetic field generated by the current by using multiple turns of wire. The\ninstruments were at first called \"multipliers\" due to this common design\nfeature.[2] The term \"galvanometer,\" in common use by 1836, was derived from\nthe surname of Italian electricity researcher [Luigi\nGalvani](/wiki/Luigi_Galvani \"Luigi Galvani\"), who in 1791 discovered that\nelectric current would make a [dead frog's leg jerk](/wiki/Frog_galvanoscope\n\"Frog galvanoscope\").\n\n### Poggendorff and\nThomson[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Poggendorff and Thomson\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Thomsons_mirror_galvanometer%2C_1858._%289663806048%29.jpg/320px-\nThomsons_mirror_galvanometer%2C_1858._%289663806048%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Thomsons_mirror_galvanometer,_1858._\\(9663806048\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Thomsons_mirror_galvanometer,_1858._\\(9663806048\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThomson mirror galvanometer, patented in 1858.\n\nOriginally, the instruments relied on the Earth's magnetic field to provide\nthe restoring force for the compass needle. These were called \"tangent\"\ngalvanometers and had to be oriented before use. Later instruments of the\n\"astatic\" type used opposing magnets to become independent of the Earth's\nfield and would operate in any orientation. The most sensitive form, the\nThomson or [mirror galvanometer](/wiki/Mirror_galvanometer \"Mirror\ngalvanometer\"), was patented in 1858 by [William\nThomson](/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin \"William Thomson, 1st Baron\nKelvin\") (Lord Kelvin) as an improvement of an earlier design invented in 1826\nby [Johann Christian Poggendorff](/wiki/Johann_Christian_Poggendorff \"Johann\nChristian Poggendorff\"). Thomson's design, was able to detect very rapid\ncurrent changes, by using small magnets attached to a lightweight mirror,\nsuspended by a thread, instead of a compass needle. The deflection of a light\nbeam on the mirror greatly magnified the deflection induced by small currents.\nAlternatively, the deflection of the suspended magnets could be observed\ndirectly through a microscope.\n\n### Georg Ohm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Georg Ohm\")]\n\nThe ability to measure quantitatively voltage and current allowed [Georg\nOhm](/wiki/Georg_Ohm \"Georg Ohm\") to formulate that – the voltage across a\nconductor is directly proportional to the current through it – [Ohm's\nLaw](/wiki/Ohm%27s_Law \"Ohm's Law\").\n\n### D'Arsonval and\nDeprez[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: D'Arsonval and Deprez\")]\n\nThe early moving-magnet form of galvanometer had the disadvantage that it was\naffected by any magnets or iron masses near it, and its deflection was not\nlinearly proportional to the current. In 1882 [Jacques-Arsène\nd'Arsonval](/wiki/Jacques-Ars%C3%A8ne_d%27Arsonval \"Jacques-Arsène\nd'Arsonval\") and [Marcel Deprez](/wiki/Marcel_Deprez \"Marcel Deprez\")\ndeveloped [a form](/wiki/D%27Arsonval_galvanometer \"D'Arsonval galvanometer\")\nwith a stationary permanent magnet and a moving coil of wire, suspended by\nfine wires which provided both an electrical connection to the coil and the\nrestoring torque to return to the zero position. An iron tube between the\nmagnet's pole pieces defined a circular gap through which the coil rotated.\nThis gap produced a consistent, radial magnetic field across the coil, giving\na linear response throughout the instrument's range. A mirror attached to the\ncoil deflected a beam of light to indicate the coil position. The concentrated\nmagnetic field and delicate suspension made these instruments sensitive;\nd'Arsonval's initial instrument could detect ten [microamperes](/wiki/Ampere\n\"Ampere\").[3]\n\n### Edward\nWeston[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Edward Weston\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/D%27Arsonval_ammeter_movement.jpg/320px-D%27Arsonval_ammeter_movement.jpg)](/wiki/File:D%27Arsonval_ammeter_movement.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:D%27Arsonval_ammeter_movement.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nD'Arsonval/Weston galvanometer (ca. 1900). Part of the magnet's left [pole\npiece](/wiki/Pole_piece \"Pole piece\") is broken out to show the coil.\n\n[Edward Weston](/wiki/Edward_Weston_\\(chemist\\) \"Edward Weston \\(chemist\\)\")\nextensively improved the design. He replaced the fine wire suspension with a\npivot, and provided restoring torque and electrical connections through spiral\nsprings rather like those of a wristwatch [balance wheel](/wiki/Balance_wheel\n\"Balance wheel\") hairspring. He developed a method of stabilizing the magnetic\nfield of the permanent magnet, so the instrument would have consistent\naccuracy over time. He replaced the light beam and mirror with a knife-edge\npointer that could be read directly. A mirror under the pointer, in the same\nplane as the scale, eliminated [parallax](/wiki/Parallax \"Parallax\")\nobservation error. To maintain the field strength, Weston's design used a very\nnarrow circumferential slot through which the coil moved, with a minimal air-\ngap. This improved linearity of pointer deflection with respect to coil\ncurrent. Finally, the coil was wound on a light-weight form made of conductive\nmetal, which acted as a damper. By 1888, Edward Weston had patented and\nbrought out a commercial form of this instrument, which became a standard\nelectrical equipment component. It was known as a \"portable\" instrument\nbecause it was affected very little by mounting position or by transporting it\nfrom place to place. This design is almost universally used in moving-coil\nmeters today.\n\nInitially laboratory instruments relying on the Earth's own magnetic field to\nprovide restoring force for the pointer, galvanometers were developed into\ncompact, rugged, sensitive portable instruments essential to the development\nof electro-technology.\n\n## Types[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Types\")]\n\nSome galvanometers use a solid pointer on a scale to show measurements; other\nvery sensitive types use a miniature mirror and a beam of light to provide\nmechanical amplification of low-level signals.\n\n### Tangent\ngalvanometer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Tangent galvanometer\")]\n\n[![Drawing.

H. Bunnell Co. around 1890.\n\nA tangent galvanometer is an early [measuring\ninstrument](/wiki/Measuring_instrument \"Measuring instrument\") used for the\nmeasurement of [electric current](/wiki/Electric_current \"Electric current\").\nIt works by using a [compass](/wiki/Compass \"Compass\") needle to compare a\n[magnetic field](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic field\") generated by the\nunknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth. It gets its name from its\noperating principle, the tangent law of magnetism, which states that the\n[tangent](/wiki/Tangent \"Tangent\") of the angle a compass needle makes is\nproportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic\nfields. It was first described by [Claude Pouillet](/wiki/Claude_Pouillet\n\"Claude Pouillet\") in 1837.\n\nA tangent galvanometer consists of a coil of insulated copper wire wound on a\ncircular non-magnetic frame. The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal\nbase provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical\naxis passing through its centre. A compass box is mounted horizontally at the\ncentre of a circular scale. It consists of a tiny, powerful magnetic needle\npivoted at the centre of the coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in\nthe horizontal plane. The circular scale is divided into four quadrants. Each\nquadrant is graduated from 0° to 90°. A long thin aluminium pointer is\nattached to the needle at its centre and at right angle to it. To avoid errors\ndue to parallax, a plane mirror is mounted below the compass needle.\n\nIn operation, the instrument is first rotated until the magnetic field of the\nEarth, indicated by the compass needle, is parallel with the plane of the\ncoil. Then the unknown current is applied to the coil. This creates a second\nmagnetic field on the axis of the coil, perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic\nfield. The compass needle responds to the [vector sum](/wiki/Vector_sum\n\"Vector sum\") of the two fields, and deflects to an angle equal to the tangent\nof the ratio of the two fields. From the angle read from the compass's scale,\nthe current could be found from a table.[4] The current supply wires have to\nbe wound in a small helix, like a pig's tail, otherwise the field due to the\nwire will affect the compass needle and an incorrect reading will be obtained.\n\n#### Theory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Theory\")]\n\n[![Photograph.

The indicator needle of\nthe compass is perpendicular to the shorter, black magnetic needle.\n\nThe galvanometer is oriented so that the plane of the coil is vertical and\naligned along parallel to the horizontal component _B H_ of the Earth's\nmagnetic field (i.e. parallel to the local \"magnetic meridian\"). When an\nelectric current flows through the galvanometer coil, a second magnetic field\n_B_ is created. At the center of the coil, where the compass needle is\nlocated, the coil's field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil. The\nmagnitude of the coil's field is:\n\n     B = μ 0 n I 2 r {\\displaystyle B={\\mu _{0}nI \\over 2r}\\,} ![B={\\\\mu_0 nI\\\\over 2r}\\\\,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9df4977b8ef7853ec5de3ae76364e51c153b24cf)\n\nwhere _I_ is the current in [amperes](/wiki/Ampere_\\(unit\\) \"Ampere\n\\(unit\\)\"), _n_ is the number of turns of the coil and _r_ is the radius of\nthe coil. These two perpendicular magnetic fields add\n[vectorially](/wiki/Parallelogram_of_force \"Parallelogram of force\"), and the\ncompass needle points along the direction of their resultant _B H+B_.

The maximum resolution is obtained when\nthe value of _θ_ is 45°. When the value of _θ_ is close to 0° or 90°, a large\npercentage change in the current will only move the needle a few degrees. [5]\n\n#### Geomagnetic field\nmeasurement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Geomagnetic field measurement\")]\n\nA tangent galvanometer can also be used to measure the magnitude of the\nhorizontal component of the [geomagnetic field](/wiki/Geomagnetic_field\n\"Geomagnetic field\"). When used in this way, a low-voltage power source, such\nas a battery, is connected in series with a [rheostat](/wiki/Rheostat\n\"Rheostat\"), the galvanometer, and an [ammeter](/wiki/Ammeter \"Ammeter\"). The\ngalvanometer is first aligned so that the coil is parallel to the geomagnetic\nfield, whose direction is indicated by the compass when there is no current\nthrough the coils. The battery is then connected and the rheostat is adjusted\nuntil the compass needle deflects 45 degrees from the geomagnetic field,\nindicating that the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil\nis the same as that of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field. This\nfield strength can be calculated from the current as measured by the ammeter,\nthe number of turns of the coil, and the radius of the coils.\n\n### Astatic\ngalvanometer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Astatic galvanometer\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Astatic_Galvanometer_brass_and_ivory.jpg/220px-\nAstatic_Galvanometer_brass_and_ivory.jpg)](/wiki/File:Astatic_Galvanometer_brass_and_ivory.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Astatic_Galvanometer_brass_and_ivory.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAstatic galvanometer.\n\nUnlike the tangent galvanometer, the astatic galvanometer does not use the\nEarth's magnetic field for measurement, so it does not need to be oriented\nwith respect to the Earth's field, making it easier to use. It has two\nmagnetized needles parallel to each other, but with the magnetic poles\nreversed. suspended by a silk thread. The lower needle is inside a vertical\ncurrent sensing coil of wire and is deflected by the magnetic field created by\nthe passing current, as in the tangent galvanometer above. The purpose of the\nsecond needle is to cancel the dipole moment of the first needle, so the\nsuspended armature has no net [magnetic dipole\nmoment](/wiki/Magnetic_dipole_moment \"Magnetic dipole moment\"), and thus is\nnot affected by the earth's magnetic field. The needle's rotation is opposed\nby the torsional elasticity of the suspension thread, which is proportional to\nthe angle.\n\nThe _astatic galvanometer_ was developed by [Leopoldo\nNobili](/wiki/Leopoldo_Nobili \"Leopoldo Nobili\") in 1825.[6]\n\n### Mirror\ngalvanometer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Mirror galvanometer\")]\n\nMain article: [mirror galvanometer](/wiki/Mirror_galvanometer \"Mirror\ngalvanometer\")\n\nTo achieve higher sensitivity to detect extremely small currents, the [mirror\ngalvanometer](/wiki/Mirror_galvanometer \"Mirror galvanometer\") substituted a\nlightweight mirror for the pointer. It consisted of horizontal magnets\nsuspended from a fine fiber, inside a vertical coil of wire, with a mirror\nattached to the magnets. A beam of light reflected from the mirror fell on a\ngraduated scale across the room, acting as a long mass-less pointer. The\nmirror galvanometer was used as the receiver in the first trans-Atlantic\n[submarine telegraph cables](/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable \"Submarine\ncommunications cable\") in the 1850s, to detect the extremely faint pulses of\ncurrent after their thousand mile journey under the Atlantic. In a device\ncalled an [oscillograph](/wiki/Oscillograph \"Oscillograph\"), the moving beam\nof light was used, to produce graphs of current versus time, by recording\nmeasurements on photographic film. The [string\ngalvanometer](/wiki/String_galvanometer \"String galvanometer\") was a type of\nmirror galvanometer so sensitive that it was used to make the first\n[electrocardiogram](/wiki/Electrocardiogram \"Electrocardiogram\") of the\nelectrical activity of the human heart.\n\n### Ballistic\ngalvanometer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Ballistic galvanometer\")]\n\nMain article: [Ballistic galvanometer](/wiki/Ballistic_galvanometer \"Ballistic\ngalvanometer\")\n\nA ballistic galvanometer is a type of sensitive galvanometer for measuring the\nquantity of [charge](/wiki/Electric_charge \"Electric charge\") discharged\nthrough it. In reality it is an [integrator](/wiki/Integrator \"Integrator\"),\nunlike a current-measuring galvanometer, the moving part has a large [moment\nof inertia](/wiki/Moment_of_inertia \"Moment of inertia\") that gives it a long\n[oscillation](/wiki/Oscillation \"Oscillation\") period. It can be either of the\nmoving coil or moving magnet type, commonly it is a [mirror\ngalvanometer](/wiki/Mirror_galvanometer \"Mirror galvanometer\").\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Vibration galvanometer](/wiki/Vibration_galvanometer \"Vibration galvanometer\")\n  * [Thermo galvanometer](/wiki/Thermo_galvanometer \"Thermo galvanometer\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galvanometer&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Schiffer, Michael Brian.
