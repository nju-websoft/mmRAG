ATP is required to cause separation of the\n[actin-myosin](/wiki/Myofibril \"Myofibril\") [cross-\nbridges](/wiki/Sliding_filament_theory \"Sliding filament theory\") during\nrelaxation of muscle.[2] When oxygen is no longer present, the body may\ncontinue to produce ATP via anaerobic [glycolysis](/wiki/Glycolysis\n\"Glycolysis\"). When the body's [glycogen](/wiki/Glycogen \"Glycogen\") is\ndepleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis\nbecause it is unable to break those bridges.[3]\n\nAdditionally, calcium enters the [cytosol](/wiki/Cytosol \"Cytosol\") after\ndeath. Calcium is released into the cytosol due to the deterioration of the\n[sarcoplasmic reticulum](/wiki/Sarcoplasmic_reticulum \"Sarcoplasmic\nreticulum\"). Also, the breakdown of the sarcolemma causes additional calcium\nto enter the cytosol. The calcium activates the formation of actin-myosin\ncross-bridging. Once calcium is introduced into the cytosol, it binds to the\ntroponin of thin filaments, which causes the troponin-tropomyosin complex to\nchange shape and allow the myosin heads to bind to the active sites of actin\nproteins.[1] In rigor mortis [myosin](/wiki/Myosin \"Myosin\") heads continue\nbinding with the active sites of actin proteins via [adenosine\ndiphosphate](/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate \"Adenosine diphosphate\") (ADP), and\nthe muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the\ncomplex.[2]\n\nNormal relaxation would occur by replacing ADP with ATP, which would\ndestabilize the myosin-actin bond and break the cross-bridge.[1] However, as\nATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle\n[tissue](/wiki/Tissue_\\(biology\\) \"Tissue \\(biology\\)\") by\n[enzymes](/wiki/Enzyme \"Enzyme\") (endogenous or bacterial) during\n[decomposition](/wiki/Decomposition \"Decomposition\"). As part of the process\nof decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the\nmuscle contraction to release and the body to relax.[4][5] Decomposition of\nthe myofilaments occurs 48 to 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which\noccurs approximately 13 hours after death.[1]\n\n## Physical\nchanges[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rigor_mortis&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Physical changes\")]\n\nAt the time of death, a condition called \"primary flaccidity\" occurs.\nFollowing this, the muscles stiffen in rigor mortis. All muscles in the body\nare affected. Starting between two and six hours following death, rigor mortis\nbegins with the eyelids, neck, and jaw. The sequence may be due to different\n[lactic acid](/wiki/Lactic_acid \"Lactic acid\") levels among different muscles,\nwhich is directly related to the difference in [glycogen](/wiki/Glycogen\n\"Glycogen\") levels and different types of muscle fibers.\n\nRigor mortis then spreads to the other muscles, including the internal organs,\nwithin the next four to six hours. The onset of rigor mortis is affected by\nthe individual's age, sex, physical condition, and muscular build. Rigor\nmortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their\nsmaller muscle mass.[6]\n\n## Applications in meat\nindustry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rigor_mortis&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Applications in meat industry\")]\n\nRigor mortis is very important in meat technology. The onset of rigor mortis\nand its resolution partially determine the tenderness of [meat](/wiki/Meat\n\"Meat\"). If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 °C (59 °F), a\nphenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres\nshrink to a third of their original length.\n\nCold shortening is caused by the release of stored [calcium](/wiki/Calcium\n\"Calcium\") ions from the [sarcoplasmic reticulum](/wiki/Sarcoplasmic_reticulum\n\"Sarcoplasmic reticulum\") of muscle fibers, in response to the cold stimulus.\nThe calcium ions trigger powerful muscle contraction aided by ATP molecules.\nTo prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is\ncarried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after\n[slaughter](/wiki/Animal_slaughter \"Animal slaughter\") and\n[skinning](/wiki/Skinning \"Skinning\"). In this process, the\n[carcass](/wiki/Cadaver \"Cadaver\") is stimulated with [alternating\ncurrent](/wiki/Alternating_current \"Alternating current\"), causing it to\ncontract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and\nprevents cold shortening.[7]\n\n## Application in forensic\npathology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rigor_mortis&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Application in forensic pathology\")]\n\nThe degree of rigor mortis may be used in [forensic\npathology](/wiki/Forensic_pathology \"Forensic pathology\"), to determine the\napproximate time of death. A dead body holds its position as rigor mortis sets\nin. If the body is moved after death, but before rigor mortis begins, forensic\ntechniques such as [livor mortis](/wiki/Livor_mortis \"Livor mortis\") can be\napplied. If the position in which a body is found does not match the location\nwhere it is found (for example, if it is flat on its back with one arm\nsticking straight up), that could mean someone moved it.\n\nSeveral factors also affect the progression of rigor mortis, and investigators\ntake these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is\nthe ambient temperature. In warm environments, the onset and pace of rigor\nmortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic\nprocesses that cause decay. Low temperatures, however, slow them down.\nTherefore, for a person who dies outside in frozen conditions rigor mortis may\nlast several days more than normal, so investigators may have to abandon it as\na tool for determining time of death.[8][9]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rigor_mortis&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Cadaveric spasm](/wiki/Cadaveric_spasm \"Cadaveric spasm\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rigor_mortis&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ Saladin, K.S. 2010.
