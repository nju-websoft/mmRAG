The treaty included the governments of the [Democratic\nRepublic of Vietnam](/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Vietnam \"Democratic Republic\nof Vietnam\") (North Vietnam), the [Republic of\nVietnam](/wiki/Republic_of_Vietnam \"Republic of Vietnam\") (South Vietnam), and\nthe [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"), as well as the\n[Provisional Revolutionary\nGovernment](/wiki/Provisional_Revolutionary_Government_of_the_Republic_of_South_Vietnam\n\"Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam\") (PRG)\nthat represented indigenous South Vietnamese revolutionaries. It ended direct\nU.S. military combat, and temporarily stopped the fighting between North and\nSouth Vietnam. However, the agreement was not ratified by the [United States\nSenate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\").[1][2]\n\nThe negotiations that led to the accord began in 1968, after various lengthy\ndelays. As a result of the accord, the [International Control\nCommission](/wiki/International_Control_Commission \"International Control\nCommission\") (ICC) was replaced by the [International Commission of Control\nand Supervision](/wiki/International_Commission_of_Control_and_Supervision\n\"International Commission of Control and Supervision\") (ICCS) to fulfill the\nagreement.

The\nSouth Vietnamese government controlled about 80 percent of the territory and\n90 percent of the population, although many areas were contested.\n\nThe document began with the statement that \"the United States and all other\ncountries respect the independence, [sovereignty](/wiki/Sovereignty\n\"Sovereignty\"), unity, and [territorial integrity](/wiki/Territorial_integrity\n\"Territorial integrity\") of Vietnam as recognized by the [1954 Geneva\nAgreements on Vietnam](/wiki/Geneva_Conference_\\(1954\\) \"Geneva Conference\n\\(1954\\)\")\". The inclusion of this provision was a victory for the communist\nside —Saigon and the [Vietcong](/wiki/Viet_Cong \"Viet Cong\")—towards a\npolitical settlement that would allow the South Vietnamese people to \"decide\nthemselves the political future of South Viet-Nam through genuinely free and\ndemocratic general elections under international supervision.\"\n\n  * Reunification of Vietnam was to be \"carried out step by step through peaceful means\".\n  * If South Vietnam required any military hardware to defend itself against any North Vietnam aggression, the United States agreed to provide replacement aid to the South Vietnam on a piece-by-piece, one-to-one replacement basis.[3]\n\n## Paris peace\nnegotiations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Paris_Peace_Accords&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Paris peace negotiations\")]\n\n### Early\nDeadlocks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Paris_Peace_Accords&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Early Deadlocks\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Johnson](/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson \"Lyndon B.\nJohnson\") halted bombing operations over the northern portion of the North\nVietnam ([Operation Rolling Thunder](/wiki/Operation_Rolling_Thunder\n\"Operation Rolling Thunder\")), in order to encourage [Hanoi](/wiki/Hanoi\n\"Hanoi\") (the perceived [locus](/wiki/Locus_of_control \"Locus of control\") of\nthe insurgency) to begin negotiations. Shortly thereafter, Hanoi agreed to\ndiscuss a complete halt of the bombing, and a date was set for representatives\nof both parties to meet in Paris, France. The sides first met on May 10, with\nthe delegations headed by [Xuân Thuỷ](/wiki/Xu%C3%A2n_Thu%E1%BB%B7 \"Xuân\nThuỷ\"), who would remain the official leader of the North Vietnamese\ndelegation throughout the process, and U.S. [ambassador-at-\nlarge](/wiki/Ambassador-at-Large \"Ambassador-at-Large\") [W. Averell\nHarriman](/wiki/W._Averell_Harriman \"W. Averell Harriman\").\n\nFor five months, the negotiations stalled as North Vietnam demanded that all\nbombing of North Vietnam be stopped, while the U.S. side demanded that North\nVietnam agree to a reciprocal de-escalation in South Vietnam; it was not until\nOctober 31 that Johnson agreed to end the air strikes and serious negotiations\ncould begin.\n\nOne of the largest hurdles to effective negotiation was the fact that North\nVietnam and its ally in South Vietnam, the [National Front for the Liberation\nof South Vietnam](/wiki/National_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_South_Vietnam\n\"National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam\") (NLF, or [Viet\nCong](/wiki/Viet_Cong \"Viet Cong\")), refused to recognize the government of\nSouth Vietnam; with equal persistence, the government in [Saigon](/wiki/Saigon\n\"Saigon\") refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the NLF. Harriman resolved\nthis dispute by developing a system by which North Vietnam and U.S. would be\nthe named parties; NLF officials could join the North Vietnam team without\nbeing recognized by South Vietnam, while Saigon's representatives joined their\nU.S. allies.\n\nA similar debate concerned the shape of the table to be used at the\nconference. The North favored a circular table, in which all parties,\nincluding NLF representatives, would appear to be \"equal\"' in importance. The\nSouth Vietnamese argued that only a rectangular table was acceptable, for only\na rectangle could show two distinct sides to the conflict. Eventually a\ncompromise was reached, in which representatives of the northern and southern\ngovernments would sit at a circular table, with members representing all other\nparties sitting at individual square tables around them.\n\n### Claimed sabotage of negotiations by Nixon\ncampaign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Paris_Peace_Accords&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Claimed sabotage of negotiations by Nixon campaign\")]\n\n[Bryce Harlow](/wiki/Bryce_Harlow \"Bryce Harlow\"), a former White House staff\nmember in the [Eisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\")\nadministration, claimed to have \"a double agent working in the White\nHouse....I kept Nixon informed.\" Harlow and [Henry\nKissinger](/wiki/Henry_Kissinger \"Henry Kissinger\") (who was friendly with\nboth campaigns and guaranteed a job in either a\n[Humphrey](/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey \"Hubert Humphrey\") or Nixon administration in\nthe upcoming election) separately predicted Johnson's \"bombing halt\".\nDemocratic senator [George Smathers](/wiki/George_Smathers \"George Smathers\")\ninformed President Johnson that \"the word is out that we are making an effort\nto throw the election to Humphrey. Nixon has been told of it\".[4]\n\nAccording to presidential historian [Robert Dallek](/wiki/Robert_Dallek\n\"Robert Dallek\"), Kissinger's advice \"rested not on special knowledge of\ndecision making at the White House but on an astute analyst's insight into\nwhat was happening.\" [CIA](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency \"Central\nIntelligence Agency\") intelligence analyst [William Bundy](/wiki/William_Bundy\n\"William Bundy\") stated that Kissinger obtained \"no useful inside information\"\nfrom his trip to Paris, and \"almost any experienced Hanoi watcher might have\ncome to the same conclusion\". While Kissinger may have \"hinted that his advice\nwas based on contacts with the Paris delegation,\" this sort of \"self-\npromotion...is at worst a minor and not uncommon practice, quite different\nfrom getting and reporting real secrets.\"[4]\n\nNixon asked the prominent Asian-American politician [Anna\nChennault](/wiki/Anna_Chennault \"Anna Chennault\") to be his \"channel to Mr.\n[Thieu](/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_V%C4%83n_Thi%E1%BB%87u \"Nguyễn Văn Thiệu\")\";\nChennault agreed and periodically reported to [John\nMitchell](/wiki/John_N._Mitchell \"John N. Mitchell\") that Thieu had no\nintention of attending a peace conference. On November 2, Chennault informed\nthe South Vietnamese ambassador: \"I have just heard from my boss in\nAlbuquerque who says his boss [Nixon] is going to win. And you tell your boss\n[Thieu] to hold on a while longer.\"[5] In response, President Johnson ordered\nthe wire-tapping of members of the Nixon campaign.[6][7] Dallek wrote that\nNixon's efforts \"probably made no difference\" because Thieu was unwilling to\nattend the talks and there was little chance of an agreement being reached\nbefore the election; however, his use of information provided by Harlow and\nKissinger was morally questionable, and vice president [Hubert\nHumphrey](/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey \"Hubert Humphrey\")'s decision not to make\nNixon's actions public was \"an uncommon act of political decency.\"[8]\n\n### Nixon\ngovernment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Paris_Peace_Accords&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Nixon government\")]\n\nAfter winning the [1968 presidential\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1968 \"United States\npresidential election, 1968\"), Richard Nixon became president of the U.S. in\nJanuary 1969. He then replaced U.S. ambassador Harriman with [Henry Cabot\nLodge Jr.](/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr. \"Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.\"), who was later\nreplaced by [David Bruce](/wiki/David_K._E._Bruce \"David K. E. Bruce\"). Also\nthat year, the NLF set up a [Provisional Revolutionary\nGovernment](/wiki/Provisional_Revolutionary_Government_of_the_Republic_of_South_Vietnam\n\"Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam\") (PRG)\nto gain government status at the talks. However, the primary negotiations that\nled to the agreement did not occur at the Peace Conference at all, but were\ncarried out during secret negotiations between Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ, which\nbegan on August 4, 1969.\n\nNorth Vietnam insisted for three years that the agreement could not be\nconcluded unless the United States agreed to remove South Vietnamese President\n[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu](/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_V%C4%83n_Thi%E1%BB%87u \"Nguyễn Văn\nThiệu\") from power and replace him with someone more acceptable to Hanoi.\nNixon and Kissinger were unwilling to sign an agreement to overthrow a\ngovernment the NLF had failed to overthrow by force of arms, though the extent\nof North Vietnamese demands is contested. Historian [Marilyn B.\nYoung](/wiki/Marilyn_B._Young \"Marilyn B. Young\"), whose expertise is in\nAmerican foreign relations, contends that the contents of Hanoi's proposal\nwere systematically distorted from their original plea to _permit_ Thiệu's\nreplacement, to what Kissinger propagated as a demand for his overthrow.[9]\n\n### Breakthrough and\nagreement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Paris_Peace_Accords&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Breakthrough and agreement\")]\n\nOn May 8, 1972, President Nixon made a major concession to North Vietnam by\nannouncing that the U.S. would accept a [cease-fire](/wiki/Ceasefire\n\"Ceasefire\") in place as a precondition for its military withdrawal. In other\nwords, the U.S. would withdraw its forces from South Vietnam without North\nVietnam doing the same. The concession broke a deadlock and resulted in\nprogress in the talks over the next few months.[10]\n\nThe final major breakthrough came on October 8, 1972. Prior to this, North\nVietnam had been disappointed by the results of its _Nguyen Hue Offensive_\n(known in the West as the [Easter Offensive](/wiki/Easter_Offensive \"Easter\nOffensive\")), which had resulted in the United States countering with\n\"Operation Linebacker,\" a significant air bombing campaign that blunted the\nNorth's drive in the South as well as inflicting damage in the North. Also,\nthey feared increased isolation if Nixon's efforts at\n[détente](/wiki/D%C3%A9tente \"Détente\") significantly improved U.S. relations\nwith the chief [communist](/wiki/Communism \"Communism\") powers, the [Soviet\nUnion](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") and the [People's Republic of\nChina](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China \"People's Republic of China\"), who\nwere backing the North Vietnamese military effort. In a meeting with\nKissinger, Thọ significantly modified his bargaining line, allowing that the\nSaigon government could remain in power and that negotiations between the two\nSouth Vietnamese parties could develop a final settlement. Within 10 days the\nsecret talks drew up a final draft. Kissinger held a press conference in\nWashington during which he announced that \"peace is at hand.\"\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Vietnam_peace_agreement_signing.jpg/220px-\nVietnam_peace_agreement_signing.jpg)](/wiki/File:Vietnam_peace_agreement_signing.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Vietnam_peace_agreement_signing.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSigning the peace accords\n\nWhen Thiệu, who had not even been informed of the secret negotiations, was\npresented with the draft of the new agreement, he was furious with Kissinger\nand Nixon (who were perfectly aware of South Vietnam's negotiating position)\nand refused to accept it without significant changes. He then made several\npublic radio addresses, claiming that the proposed agreement was worse than it\nactually was. Hanoi was flabbergasted, believing that it had been duped into a\n[propaganda](/wiki/Propaganda \"Propaganda\") ploy by Kissinger. On October 26,\nRadio Hanoi broadcast key details of the draft agreement.\n\nHowever, as U.S. casualties had mounted throughout the conflict since 1965,\nAmerican domestic support for the war had deteriorated, and by the fall of\n1972 there was major pressure on the Nixon administration to withdraw from the\nwar. Consequently, the U.S. brought great diplomatic pressure upon their South\nVietnamese ally to sign the [peace treaty](/wiki/Peace_treaty \"Peace treaty\")\neven if the concessions Thiệu wanted could not be achieved. Nixon pledged to\nprovide continued substantial aid to South Vietnam, and given his recent\nlandslide victory in the presidential election, it seemed possible that he\nwould be able to follow through on that pledge. To demonstrate his seriousness\nto Thiệu, Nixon ordered the heavy [Operation Linebacker\nII](/wiki/Operation_Linebacker_II \"Operation Linebacker II\") bombings of North\nVietnam in December 1972. Nixon also attempted to bolster South Vietnam's\nmilitary forces by ordering that large quantities of U.S. military material\nand equipment be given to South Vietnam from May to December 1972 under\n[Operations Enhance and Enhance\nPlus](/wiki/Operations_Enhance_and_Enhance_Plus \"Operations Enhance and\nEnhance Plus\").[11] These operations were also designed to keep North Vietnam\nat the negotiating table and to prevent them from abandoning negotiations and\nseeking total victory. When the North Vietnamese government agreed to resume\n\"technical\" discussions with the United States, Nixon ordered a halt to\nbombings north of the 20th parallel on December 30. With the U.S. committed to\ndisengagement (and after threats from Nixon that South Vietnam would be\nabandoned if he did not agree), Thiệu had little choice but to accede.\n\nOn January 15, 1973, President Nixon announced a suspension of offensive\nactions against North Vietnam. Kissinger and Thọ met again on January 23 and\nsigned off on a treaty that was basically identical to the draft of three\nmonths earlier. The agreement was signed by the leaders of the official\ndelegations on January 27, 1973, at the [Hotel\nMajestic](/wiki/Hotel_Majestic_\\(Paris\\) \"Hotel Majestic \\(Paris\\)\") in Paris,\nFrance.\n\n##\nAftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Paris_Peace_Accords&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\n**Balance of Military Forces (January 1973)**[12] _South Vietnamese armed\nforces_  \n---  \nGround combat regulars | 210,000  \nRegional and Popular Force militias | 510,000  \nService troops | 200,000  \nTotal: South Vietnamese armed forces |  | 920,000  \n_Communist armed forces_  \nNorth Vietnamese ground troops in South Vietnam | 123,000  \nViet Cong ground troops | 25,000  \nService troops | 71,000  \nTotal: Communist armed forces |  | 219,000  \n  \nThe Paris Peace Accords effectively removed the U.S. from the conflict in\nVietnam. However, the agreement's provisions were routinely flouted by both\nthe North Vietnamese and the Saigon government, eliciting no response from the\nUnited States, and ultimately resulting in the communists enlarging the area\nunder their control by the end of 1973. North Vietnamese military forces\ngradually built up their military infrastructure in the areas they controlled\nand two years later were in a position to launch the successful offensive that\nended South Vietnam's status as an independent country.\n\nNixon had secretly promised Thiệu that he would use [airpower](/wiki/Airpower\n\"Airpower\") to support the Saigon government should it be necessary. During\nhis confirmation hearings in June 1973, [Secretary of\nDefense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense \"United States Secretary of\nDefense\") [James Schlesinger](/wiki/James_Schlesinger \"James Schlesinger\") was\nsharply criticized by some senators after he stated that he would recommend\nresumption of U.S. bombing in North Vietnam if North Vietnam launched a major\noffensive against South Vietnam, but by August 15, 1973, 95% of American\ntroops and their allies had left Vietnam (both North and South) as well as\n[Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia \"Cambodia\") and [Laos](/wiki/Laos \"Laos\") under the\n[Case-Church Amendment](/wiki/Case%E2%80%93Church_Amendment \"Case–Church\nAmendment\"). The amendment, which was approved by the U.S. Congress in June\n1973, prohibited further U.S. military activity in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia\nunless the president secured Congressional approval in advance. However,\nduring this time, Nixon was being driven from office due to the [Watergate\nscandal](/wiki/Watergate_scandal \"Watergate scandal\"), which led to his\nresignation in 1974. When the North Vietnamese began [their final\noffensive](/wiki/1975_Spring_Offensive \"1975 Spring Offensive\") early in 1975,\nU.S. Congress refused to appropriate additional military assistance for South\nVietnam, citing strong opposition to the war by Americans and the loss of\nAmerican equipment to the North by retreating Southern forces. Thiệu\nsubsequently resigned, accusing the U.S. of betrayal in a TV and radio\naddress:\n\n> At the time of the peace agreement the United States agreed to replace\n> equipment on a one-by-one basis. But the United States did not keep its\n> word. Is an American's word reliable these days? The United States did not\n> keep its promise to help us fight for freedom and it was in the same fight\n> that the United States lost 50,000 of its young men.[13]\n\n[Saigon fell](/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon \"Fall of Saigon\") to the North Vietnamese\narmy supported by Viet Cong units on April 30, 1975. Schlesinger had announced\nearly in the morning of April 29 the beginning of [Operation Frequent\nWind](/wiki/Operation_Frequent_Wind \"Operation Frequent Wind\"), which entailed\nthe evacuation of the last U.S. diplomatic, military and civilian personnel\nfrom Saigon via helicopter, which was completed in the early morning hours of\nApril 30. Not only did North Vietnam conquer South Vietnam, but the communists\nwere also victorious in Cambodia when the [Khmer Rouge](/wiki/Khmer_Rouge\n\"Khmer Rouge\") captured [Phnom Penh](/wiki/Phnom_Penh \"Phnom Penh\") on April\n17, as were the [Pathet Lao](/wiki/Pathet_Lao \"Pathet Lao\") in Laos successful\nin capturing [Vientiane](/wiki/Vientiane \"Vientiane\") on December 2. Like\nSaigon, U.S. civilian and military personnel were evacuated from Phnom Penh,\nU.S. diplomatic presence in Vientiane was significantly downgraded, and the\nnumber of remaining U.S. personnel was severely reduced.\n\n##\nSignatories[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Paris_Peace_Accords&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Signatories\")]\n\n  * [![United States](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png)](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") [Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.](/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge,_Jr. \"Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.\"), former [United States Ambassador to South Vietnam](/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_South_Vietnam \"United States Ambassador to South Vietnam\"), led the U.S. delegation\n  * [![United States](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png)](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") [William P.
