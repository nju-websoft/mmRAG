Initially she\nrefused but writer [Constance Cary Harrison](/wiki/Constance_Cary_Harrison\n\"Constance Cary Harrison\") convinced her that the statue would be of great\nsignificance to immigrants sailing into the harbor.[5]\n\n\"The New Colossus\" was the first entry read at the exhibit's opening on\nNovember 2, 1883, and remained associated with the exhibit through a published\ncatalog until the exhibit closed after the pedestal was fully funded in August\n1885,[6][7] but was forgotten and played no role at the opening of the statue\nin 1886. It was, however, published in [Joseph Pulitzer](/wiki/Joseph_Pulitzer\n\"Joseph Pulitzer\")'s _[New York World](/wiki/New_York_World \"New York World\")_\nas well as _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York\nTimes\")_ during this time period.[8] In 1901, Lazarus's friend Georgina\nSchuyler began an effort to memorialize Lazarus and her poem, which succeeded\nin 1903 when a plaque bearing the text of the poem was put on the inner wall\nof the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.[4]\n\nThe line \"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\" is missing a comma, and\nreads \"Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!\" on the plaque hanging inside\nthe Statue of Liberty[9] since its unveiling in 1903.\n\nThe original manuscript is held by the [American Jewish Historical\nSociety](/wiki/American_Jewish_Historical_Society \"American Jewish Historical\nSociety\").[10]\n\n## Contents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_New_Colossus&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Contents\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Colosse_de_Rhodes_%28Barclay%29.jpg/220px-\nColosse_de_Rhodes_%28Barclay%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Colosse_de_Rhodes_\\(Barclay\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Colosse_de_Rhodes_\\(Barclay\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[The Colossus of Rhodes](/wiki/The_Colossus_of_Rhodes \"The Colossus of\nRhodes\")_ , as depicted in an artist's impression of 1880\n\n> Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,  \n>  With conquering limbs astride from land to land;  \n>  Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand  \n>  A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame  \n>  Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name  \n>  MOTHER OF EXILES.

Cunningham](/wiki/John_T._Cunningham \"John T. Cunningham\") wrote that\n\"The Statue of Liberty was not conceived and sculpted as a symbol of\nimmigration, but it quickly became so as immigrant ships passed under the\ntorch and the shining face, heading toward Ellis Island. However, it was\n[Lazarus's poem] that permanently stamped on Miss Liberty the role of\nunofficial greeter of incoming immigrants.\"[12]\n\nThe poem has entered the political realm. It was quoted in [John F.\nKennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John F. Kennedy\")'s book _[A Nation of\nImmigrants](/wiki/A_Nation_of_Immigrants \"A Nation of Immigrants\")_ (1958)[13]\nas well as a 2010 political speech by [President Obama](/wiki/President_Obama\n\"President Obama\") advocating immigration policy reform.[14] On August 2nd,\n2017, the poem and its importance to the Statue of Liberty's symbolism and\nthus the effect on American immigration policy, was debated in a White House\nbriefing.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nClassical composer [David Ludwig](/wiki/David_Ludwig_\\(composer\\) \"David\nLudwig \\(composer\\)\") set the poem to music, which was performed at the\nworship service of President Obama's 2013 inauguration ceremony.[15]\n\nAuthor and scholar Julia Gordon-Bramer theorizes that Sylvia Plath's poem,\n\"Lady Lazarus,\" is about the Statue of Liberty and Lazarus in her book, _Fixed\nStars Govern a Life: Decoding Sylvia Plath_ , volume one (2014, Stephen F.\nAustin State University Press).\n\nParts of the poem also appear in popular culture. The Broadway musical _[Miss\nLiberty](/wiki/Miss_Liberty \"Miss Liberty\")_ , with music and lyrics by\n[Irving Berlin](/wiki/Irving_Berlin \"Irving Berlin\"), an immigrant himself,\nused the final stanza beginning \"Give me your tired, your poor\" as the basis\nfor a song.[16][13] It was also read in the 1941 film _[Hold Back the\nDawn](/wiki/Hold_Back_the_Dawn \"Hold Back the Dawn\")_ as well as being recited\nby the heroine in [Alfred Hitchcock](/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock \"Alfred\nHitchcock\")'s wartime film _[Saboteur](/wiki/Saboteur_\\(film\\) \"Saboteur\n\\(film\\)\")_.[13] Harpist and singer [Joanna Newsom](/wiki/Joanna_Newsom\n\"Joanna Newsom\") indirectly references the poem in her 2015 song\n\"Sapokanikan,\" in contrast to the forbidding colossus of [Percy Bysshe\nShelley](/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley \"Percy Bysshe Shelley\")'s\n_[Ozymandias](/wiki/Ozymandias \"Ozymandias\")_.[17] The poem is read aloud in\nthe eponymous episode,\"New Colossus\", in the 2016 Netflix web series _[The\nOA](/wiki/The_OA \"The OA\")_.[18]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_New_Colossus&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Statue of Liberty National Monument\"](http://www.nps.gov/stli/).
