Brolin said\nhe missed Streisand when they were asleep, and Warren wrote down the words \"I\ndon't want to miss a thing\", before there was even a song.[4]\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Don%27t_Want_to_Miss_a_Thing&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\n\"When I first heard it,\" recalled drummer [Joey Kramer](/wiki/Joey_Kramer\n\"Joey Kramer\"), \"it was just a demo with piano and singing. It was difficult\nto imagine what kind of touch Aerosmith could put on it and make it our own…\nAs soon as we began playing it as a band, then it instantly became an\nAerosmith song.\"[5]\n\nThis song was Aerosmith's biggest hit, debuting at number 1 on the U.S.\n[Billboard Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\"), where it\nstayed for four weeks in September, and reaching number 1 around the world,\nincluding Australia, the Philippines, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Norway,\nItaly, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.\n\nThe chorus is reminiscent of an earlier song [Diane Warren](/wiki/Diane_Warren\n\"Diane Warren\") that cowrote: \"[Just Like Jesse\nJames](/wiki/Just_Like_Jesse_James \"Just Like Jesse James\")\", on\n[Cher](/wiki/Cher \"Cher\")'s 1989 album _[Heart of\nStone](/wiki/Heart_of_Stone_\\(Cher_album\\) \"Heart of Stone \\(Cher album\\)\")_.\n\nThe song helped introduce Aerosmith to a new generation[6] and remains a slow\ndance staple.[7]\n\nIt was one of many songs written by Warren in that period. The original\nversion was a collaboration between Chicago musician Phil Kosch of [Treaty of\nParis](/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\\(band\\) \"Treaty of Paris \\(band\\)\") and [Super\nHappy Fun Club](/wiki/The_Super_Happy_Fun_Club \"The Super Happy Fun Club\"),\nand nephew of chart topping writer [Lou Bega](/wiki/Lou_Bega \"Lou Bega\"). Bega\nintroduced the two and they penned the initial track, but ultimately Kosch was\nuncredited.\n\nThe song was nominated for both an [Academy Award for Best Original\nSong](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Song \"Academy Award for Best\nOriginal Song\") and a [Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original\nSong](/wiki/Golden_Raspberry_Award_for_Worst_Original_Song \"Golden Raspberry\nAward for Worst Original Song\").\n\n## Track\nlisting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Don%27t_Want_to_Miss_a_Thing&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Track listing\")]\n\nCD single\n\n  1. \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" – 4:57\n  2. \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" (Rock Mix) – 4:30\n  3. \"[Taste of India](/wiki/Taste_of_India \"Taste of India\")\" (Rock Remix) – 5:52\n  4. \"Animal Crackers\" – 2:35\n\nThe song appeared on the Argentine version and a European re-released version\nof the album _[Nine Lives](/wiki/Nine_Lives_\\(Aerosmith_album\\) \"Nine Lives\n\\(Aerosmith album\\)\")_.

It\nfeatures an appearance by [Steven Tyler](/wiki/Steven_Tyler \"Steven Tyler\")'s\ndaughter [Liv](/wiki/Liv_Tyler \"Liv Tyler\"), who plays Grace Stamper in the\nfilm. Steven Tyler injured his knee the day before the shoot, so they used a\nlot of close-ups because his movement was limited.\n\nThe video begins with shots of the moon in orbit and several asteroids passing\nby safely and then a view of [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\") before zooming in to\nshow Steven Tyler singing. The shots interchange between the band and [Mission\nControl](/wiki/Mission_Control \"Mission Control\") viewing the band singing via\ntheir monitors. As the video progresses it reveals that the band is playing in\nfront of what appears to be the fictional [Space Shuttle](/wiki/Space_Shuttle\n\"Space Shuttle\") _Freedom_. Along with Aerosmith, a full hand orchestra plays\nin sync with the melody. Then smoke surrounds the orchestra and the members of\nAerosmith as _Freedom_ takes off from the launch pad. Finally, the screen goes\nout as a tearful Grace touches one of the monitors to reach out to her father\n(real life father Steven Tyler in the video; on-screen father Harry Stamper,\nplayed by [Bruce Willis](/wiki/Bruce_Willis \"Bruce Willis\"), in the film).\n\nThe video was highly successful and greatly contributed to the song's success,\nreceiving heavy airplay on MTV and went on to become the second most popular\nvideo of 1998, only behind Brandy and Monica's \"[The Boy is\nMine](/wiki/The_Boy_Is_Mine_\\(song\\) \"The Boy Is Mine \\(song\\)\")\". It also won\nawards for [MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a\nFilm](/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Best_Video_from_a_Film \"MTV Video Music\nAward for Best Video from a Film\"), and Best Video at [Boston Music\nAwards](/wiki/Boston_Music_Awards \"Boston Music Awards\").\n\n##\nCharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Don%27t_Want_to_Miss_a_Thing&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section:
