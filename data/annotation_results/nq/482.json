[Celtic Christianity](/wiki/Celtic_Christianity \"Celtic\nChristianity\"), with some traditions different from those of Rome, was present\nin [Roman Britain](/wiki/Roman_Britain \"Roman Britain\") from the first century\nAD, but after the departure of the Roman legions was in retreat to\n[Paganism](/wiki/Paganism \"Paganism\"). In 597 AD, the first authoritative\npapal mission, establishing a direct link from the [Kingdom of\nKent](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kent \"Kingdom of Kent\") to the [See of\nRome](/wiki/See_of_Rome \"See of Rome\") and to the\n[Benedictine](/wiki/Benedictine \"Benedictine\") form of\n[monasticism](/wiki/Monasticism \"Monasticism\"), was carried into effect by\n[Augustine of Canterbury](/wiki/Augustine_of_Canterbury \"Augustine of\nCanterbury\").\n\nThe English Church continuously adhered to the See of Rome for almost a\nthousand years from the time of Augustine of Canterbury, but in 1534, during\nthe reign of [King Henry VIII](/wiki/King_Henry_VIII \"King Henry VIII\"), the\nchurch, through a series of legislative acts between 1533 and 1536[1] became\nindependent from the Pope for a period as the [Church of\nEngland](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of England\"), a national church with\nHenry declaring himself Supreme Head.[2][3][4] Under Henry's son, [King Edward\nVI](/wiki/King_Edward_VI \"King Edward VI\"), the Church of England became more\ninfluenced by the European [Protestant](/wiki/Protestant \"Protestant\")\nmovement.\n\nThe English Church was brought back under full papal authority in 1553, at the\nbeginning of the reign of [Queen Mary I](/wiki/Mary_I_of_England \"Mary I of\nEngland\"),[5] and Catholicism was enforced by the [Marian\npersecutions](/wiki/Marian_persecutions \"Marian persecutions\"); however, when\n[Queen Elizabeth I](/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_I \"Queen Elizabeth I\") came to the\nthrone in 1558, the Church of England's independence from Rome was reasserted\nthrough the [settlement of 1559](/wiki/Elizabethan_Religious_Settlement\n\"Elizabethan Religious Settlement\"), which shifted the Church of England's\nteaching and practice, and in the [Act of\nUniformity](/wiki/Act_of_Uniformity_1558 \"Act of Uniformity 1558\"), which\ncaused a rift between Catholics and Queen.[6] In 1570 [Pope Pius\nV](/wiki/Pope_Pius_V \"Pope Pius V\") responded, in his bull _[Regnans in\nExcelsis](/wiki/Regnans_in_Excelsis \"Regnans in Excelsis\")_ , calling on all\nCatholics to rebel against Elizabeth and excommunicating anyone who obeyed\nher. The [Parliament of England](/wiki/Parliament_of_England \"Parliament of\nEngland\") made the fact of being a Jesuit or seminarian treasonable in 1571.\nPriests found celebrating Mass were often [hanged, drawn and\nquartered](/wiki/Hanged,_drawn_and_quartered \"Hanged, drawn and quartered\"),\nrather than being burned at the stake.[7] The Catholic Church (along with\nother non-established churches) continued in England, although it was at times\nsubject to various forms of persecution. Most [recusant](/wiki/Recusant\n\"Recusant\") members (except those in diaspora on [the\nContinent](/wiki/Continental_Europe \"Continental Europe\"), in heavily Catholic\nareas in the north, or part of the aristocracy) practised their faith in\nprivate for all practical purposes. In 1766, the Pope recognised the English\nMonarchy as lawful, and this led eventually to the [Roman Catholic Relief Act\n1829](/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Relief_Act_1829 \"Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829\").\n[Dioceses](/wiki/Diocese \"Diocese\") (replacing districts) were re-established\nby [Pope Pius IX](/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX \"Pope Pius IX\") in 1850. Along with the\n22 [Latin Rite](/wiki/Latin_Rite \"Latin Rite\") dioceses, there are the\n[Eastern Catholic](/wiki/Eastern_Catholic \"Eastern Catholic\") diocese of the\n[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Holy Family of\nLondon](/wiki/Ukrainian_Catholic_Eparchy_of_Holy_Family_of_London \"Ukrainian\nCatholic Eparchy of Holy Family of London\") and the [Syro-Malabar Catholic\nEparchy of Great Britain](/wiki/Syro-Malabar_Catholic_Eparchy_of_Great_Britain\n\"Syro-Malabar Catholic Eparchy of Great Britain\").\n\nAt the 2001 United Kingdom census, there were 4.2 million Catholics in England\nand Wales, some eight per cent of the population. One hundred years earlier,\nin 1901, they represented only 4.8 per cent of the population. In 1981, 8.7\nper cent of the population of England and Wales were Catholic.[8] In 2009, an\nIpsos Mori poll found that 9.6 per cent, or 5.2 million persons of all\nethnicities were Catholic in England and Wales.[9] Sizeable populations\ninclude [North West England](/wiki/North_West_England \"North West England\")\nwhere one in five is Catholic,[10] a result of large-scale [Irish\nimmigration](/wiki/Irish_immigration_to_Britain \"Irish immigration to\nBritain\") in the nineteenth century[11][12] as well as the high number of\nEnglish [recusants](/wiki/Recusant \"Recusant\") in\n[Lancashire](/wiki/Lancashire \"Lancashire\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Roman Britons and early Christianity\n    * 1.2 Conversion of the Anglo-Saxons\n    * 1.3 Norman Church in England and Wales\n    * 1.4 Protestantism and Catholic Resistance\n    * 1.5 Recusants and moves towards Emancipation\n    * 1.6 Coming of the Irish and English converts\n    * 1.7 Contemporary English Catholicism\n  * 2 Organisation\n    * 2.1 Hierarchy\n    * 2.2 Chaplaincies\n    * 2.3 Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham\n    * 2.4 Eastern Catholic rites\n  * 3 Demography\n    * 3.1 General statistics\n    * 3.2 Polish Catholic immigration\n  * 4 Adoption controversy\n  * 5 Catholic saints of the United Kingdom\n  * 6 Miracles\n    * 6.1 Marian apparitions\n    * 6.2 Incorruptibility\n    * 6.3 Stigmata\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Sources\n    * 8.1 Footnotes\n    * 8.2 References\n  * 9 Further reading\n    * 9.1 Primary sources\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nMain article: [History of Christianity in\nBritain](/wiki/History_of_Christianity_in_Britain \"History of Christianity in\nBritain\")\n\n### Roman Britons and early\nChristianity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Roman Britons and early Christianity\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Saint_Alban_%28cropped%29.jpg/200px-\nSaint_Alban_%28cropped%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Saint_Alban_\\(cropped\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Saint_Alban_\\(cropped\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[St. Alban](/wiki/St._Alban \"St. Alban\") is regarded as the\n[protomartyr](/wiki/Protomartyr \"Protomartyr\") of the Roman Britons.\n\nMuch of [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\") was incorporated\ninto the [Roman Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman Empire\") in 43 AD, after\n[Claudius](/wiki/Claudius \"Claudius\") led the [Roman conquest of\nBritain](/wiki/Roman_conquest_of_Britain \"Roman conquest of Britain\"),\nconquering lands inhabited by [Celtic Britons](/wiki/Celtic_Britons \"Celtic\nBritons\"). The indigenous religious traditions of the Britons, under their\npriests the [Druids](/wiki/Druids \"Druids\") were suppressed; most notably\n[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus](/wiki/Gaius_Suetonius_Paulinus \"Gaius Suetonius\nPaulinus\") launched [an attack](/wiki/Roman_conquest_of_Anglesey \"Roman\nconquest of Anglesey\") on [Ynys Môn](/wiki/Anglesey \"Anglesey\") in 60 AD and\ndestroyed the shrine and [sacred groves](/wiki/Sacred_groves \"Sacred groves\")\nthere. In the years following this, Roman influence saw the importation of\nseveral religious [cults](/wiki/Cult_\\(religious_practice\\) \"Cult \\(religious\npractice\\)\") into Britain, including [Roman mythology](/wiki/Roman_mythology\n\"Roman mythology\"), [Mithraism](/wiki/Mithraism \"Mithraism\") and the [imperial\ncult](/wiki/Imperial_cult \"Imperial cult\"). One of these sects, then\ndisapproved by the Roman authorities, was the [Levantine](/wiki/Levant\n\"Levant\")-originated religion of [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity\n\"Christianity\"). While it is unclear exactly how it arrived, the earliest\nBritish figures considered [saints](/wiki/Saint \"Saint\") by the Christians are\n[St. Alban](/wiki/St._Alban \"St. Alban\"), followed by Ss. [Julius and\nAaron](/wiki/Julius_and_Aaron \"Julius and Aaron\"), living in the 3rd\ncentury.[13]\n\nEventually, the position of the Roman authorities on Christianity moved from\nhostility, to toleration with the [Edict of Milan](/wiki/Edict_of_Milan \"Edict\nof Milan\") in 313 AD and then enforcement as [state\nreligion](/wiki/State_religion \"State religion\") following the [Edict of\nThessalonica](/wiki/Edict_of_Thessalonica \"Edict of Thessalonica\") in 380 AD,\nbecoming a key component of [Romano-British culture](/wiki/Romano-\nBritish_culture \"Romano-British culture\") and society. Records note that\n[Romano-British](/wiki/Romano-British \"Romano-British\") bishops, such as\n[Restitutus](/wiki/Restitutus \"Restitutus\"), attended the [Council of\nArles](/wiki/Council_of_Arles \"Council of Arles\") in 314, which confirmed the\ntheological findings of an earlier convocation held in Rome (the [Council of\nRome](/wiki/Council_of_Rome \"Council of Rome\")) in 313. The [Roman departure\nfrom Britain](/wiki/Roman_departure_from_Britain \"Roman departure from\nBritain\") in the following century and the subsequent [Germanic\ninvasions](/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_invasion_of_Britain \"Anglo-Saxon invasion of\nBritain\") sharply decreased contact between Britain and Continental Europe.\nChristianity, however, continued to flourish in the\n[Brittonic](/wiki/Britons_\\(historical\\) \"Britons \\(historical\\)\") areas of\nGreat Britain. During this period certain practices and traditions took hold\nin Britain and in Ireland that are collectively known as [Celtic\nChristianity](/wiki/Celtic_Christianity \"Celtic Christianity\"). Distinct\nfeatures of Celtic Christianity include a unique monastic\n[tonsure](/wiki/Tonsure \"Tonsure\") and calculations for the date of\n[Easter](/wiki/Easter \"Easter\").[14] Regardless of these differences,\nhistorians do not consider this Celtic or British Christianity a distinct\nchurch separate from general Western European Christianity.[15][16]\n\n### Conversion of the Anglo-\nSaxons[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Conversion of the Anglo-Saxons\")]\n\nIn 597, [Pope Gregory I](/wiki/Pope_Gregory_I \"Pope Gregory I\") sent\n[Augustine of Canterbury](/wiki/Augustine_of_Canterbury \"Augustine of\nCanterbury\") and 40 missionaries from Rome to evangelise the [Anglo-\nSaxons](/wiki/Anglo-Saxons \"Anglo-Saxons\"), a process completed by the 7th\ncentury. The [Gregorian mission](/wiki/Gregorian_mission \"Gregorian mission\"),\nas it is known, is of particular interest in the Catholic Church as it was the\nfirst official Papal mission to found a church. With the help of Christians\nalready residing in [Kent](/wiki/Kent \"Kent\"), Augustine established an\narchbishopric in [Canterbury](/wiki/Canterbury \"Canterbury\"), the old capital\nof Kent, and, having received the [pallium](/wiki/Pallium \"Pallium\") earlier\n(linking his new diocese to Rome), became the first in the series of Catholic\n[archbishops of Canterbury](/wiki/Archbishops_of_Canterbury \"Archbishops of\nCanterbury\"), four of whom ([Laurence](/wiki/Laurence_of_Canterbury \"Laurence\nof Canterbury\"), [Mellitus](/wiki/Mellitus \"Mellitus\"), [Justus](/wiki/Justus\n\"Justus\") and [Honorius](/wiki/Honorius_of_Canterbury \"Honorius of\nCanterbury\")) were part of the original band of\n[Benedictine](/wiki/Benedictine \"Benedictine\") missionaries. (The last\nCatholic archbishop of Canterbury was [Reginald Pole](/wiki/Reginald_Pole\n\"Reginald Pole\"), who died in 1558.) During this time of mission, Rome pursued\ngreater unity with the local church in Britain, particularly on the question\nof dating Easter. [Columbanus](/wiki/Columbanus \"Columbanus\"), Columba's\nfellow countryman and churchman, had asked for a papal judgement on the Easter\nquestion as did abbots and bishops of Ireland.[17] Later, in his _Historia\necclesiastica gentis Anglorum_ , Bede explained the reasons for the\ndiscrepancy: \"He [Columba] left successors distinguished for great charity,\nDivine love, and strict attention to the rules of discipline following indeed\nuncertain cycles in the computation of the great festival of Easter, because\nfar away as they were out of the world, no one had supplied them with the\nsynodal decrees relating to the Paschal observance.\"[18] A series of\n[synods](/wiki/Synod \"Synod\") were held to resolve the matter, culminating\nwith the [Synod of Whitby](/wiki/Synod_of_Whitby \"Synod of Whitby\") in 644.\nThe missionaries also introduced the [Rule of Benedict](/wiki/Rule_of_Benedict\n\"Rule of Benedict\"), the continental rule, to Anglo-Saxon monasteries in\nEngland.[19] [Wilfrid](/wiki/Wilfrid \"Wilfrid\"), a Benedictine consecrated\narchbishop of York (in 664), was particularly skilled in promoting the\nBenedictine Rule.[20] Over time, the Benedictine, continental rule engrafted\nupon the monasteries and parishes of England, drawing them closer to The\nContinent and Rome. As a result, the pope was often called upon to intervene\nin quarrels, affirm monarchs, and decide jurisdictions. In 787, for example,\n[Pope Adrian I](/wiki/Pope_Adrian_I \"Pope Adrian I\") elevated\n[Lichfield](/wiki/Lichfield \"Lichfield\") to an archdiocese and appointed\n[Hygeberht](/wiki/Hygeberht \"Hygeberht\") its first archbishop.[21] Later, in\n808, [Pope Leo III](/wiki/Pope_Leo_III \"Pope Leo III\") helped restore King\n[Eardwulf](/wiki/Eardwulf \"Eardwulf\") of [Northumbria](/wiki/Northumbria\n\"Northumbria\") to his throne; and in 859, [Pope Leo IV](/wiki/Pope_Leo_IV\n\"Pope Leo IV\") confirmed and anointed [Alfred the\nGreat](/wiki/Alfred_the_Great \"Alfred the Great\") king, according to _[Anglo-\nSaxon Chronicle](/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\")_.\nIndividual Benedictines seemed to play an important role throughout this\nperiod. For example, before Benedictine monk [St. Dunstan](/wiki/St._Dunstan\n\"St. Dunstan\") was consecrated archbishop of Canterbury in 960, [Pope John\nXII](/wiki/Pope_John_XII \"Pope John XII\") had him appointed legate,\ncommissioning him (along with [Ethelwold](/wiki/Ethelwold \"Ethelwold\") and\nOswald) to restore discipline in the existing monasteries of England, many of\nwhich were destroyed by Danish invaders.[22]\n\n### Norman Church in England and\nWales[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Norman Church in England and Wales\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Our_Lady_of_Walsingham_detail_I.JPG/220px-\nOur_Lady_of_Walsingham_detail_I.JPG)](/wiki/File:Our_Lady_of_Walsingham_detail_I.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Our_Lady_of_Walsingham_detail_I.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Our Lady of Walsingham](/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Walsingham \"Our Lady of\nWalsingham\")\n\nControl of the English Church passed from the Anglo-Saxons to the\n[Normans](/wiki/Normans \"Normans\") following the [Norman conquest of\nEngland](/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England \"Norman conquest of England\"). The\ntwo clerics most prominent associated with this process were the continental-\nborn [Lanfranc](/wiki/Lanfranc \"Lanfranc\") and\n[Anselm](/wiki/Anselm_of_Canterbury \"Anselm of Canterbury\"); both men were\nBenedictines. Anselm later became a [Doctor of the\nChurch](/wiki/Doctor_of_the_Church \"Doctor of the Church\"). A century later,\n[Pope Innocent III](/wiki/Pope_Innocent_III \"Pope Innocent III\") had to\nconfirm the primacy of Canterbury over four [Welsh](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\")\nchurches for many reasons, but primarily to sustain the importance of the\nGregorian foundation of Augustine's mission.[23][24]\n\nDuring mediaeval times, England and Wales were part of western Christendom.\nDuring this period, monasteries and convents, such as those at\n[Shaftesbury](/wiki/Shaftesbury_Abbey \"Shaftesbury Abbey\") and\n[Shrewsbury](/wiki/Shrewsbury_Abbey \"Shrewsbury Abbey\"), were prominent\nfeatures of society providing lodging, hospitals and education.[25] Likewise,\nschools like [Oxford University](/wiki/Oxford_University \"Oxford University\")\nand [Cambridge University](/wiki/Cambridge_University \"Cambridge University\")\nwere important. Members of [religious orders](/wiki/Religious_orders\n\"Religious orders\"), notably the [Dominicans](/wiki/Dominican_Order \"Dominican\nOrder\") and [Franciscans](/wiki/Franciscans \"Franciscans\"), settled in both\nschools and maintained houses for students. Clerics like Archbishop [Walter de\nMerton](/wiki/Walter_de_Merton \"Walter de Merton\") founded [Merton\nCollege](/wiki/Merton_College \"Merton College\") at Oxford and three different\npopes – [Gregory IX](/wiki/Gregory_IX \"Gregory IX\"), [Nicholas\nIV](/wiki/Pope_Nicholas_IV \"Pope Nicholas IV\"), and [John\nXXII](/wiki/John_XXII \"John XXII\") – gave Cambridge the legal protection and\nstatus to compete with other European [medieval\nuniversities](/wiki/Medieval_universities \"Medieval universities\").\n\nPilgrimage was a prominent feature of mediaeval Catholicism, and England and\nWales were amply provided with many popular sites of pilgrimage. The village\nof [Walsingham](/wiki/Walsingham \"Walsingham\"), Norfolk became an important\nshrine after a noblewoman called [Richeldis de\nFaverches](/wiki/Richeldis_de_Faverches \"Richeldis de Faverches\") experienced\na vision of the Virgin Mary in 1061, asking her to build a replica of the\n[Holy House](/w/index.php?title=Holy_House&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Holy House\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") at [Nazareth](/wiki/Nazareth \"Nazareth\"). In 1170,\n[Thomas Becket](/wiki/Thomas_Becket \"Thomas Becket\"), Archbishop of Canterbury\nwas murdered in Canterbury Cathedral, by followers of [King Henry\nII](/wiki/Henry_II_of_England \"Henry II of England\") and was quickly canonised\nas a martyr for the faith. This resulted in Canterbury becoming a major place\nof pilgrimage and inspired the [Canterbury Tales](/wiki/Canterbury_Tales\n\"Canterbury Tales\") by [Geoffrey Chaucer](/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer \"Geoffrey\nChaucer\"). There were also shrines at [Holywell](/wiki/Holywell \"Holywell\") in\nWales which commemorated St [Winefride](/wiki/Winefride \"Winefride\") and at\nWestminster Abbey to [Edward the Confessor](/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor \"Edward\nthe Confessor\") to name but a few.\n\nAn Englishman, Nicholas Breakspear, became [Pope Adrian\nIV](/wiki/Pope_Adrian_IV \"Pope Adrian IV\"), ruling from 1154 to 1159. Fifty-\nsix years later, [Cardinal](/wiki/Cardinal_\\(Catholicism\\) \"Cardinal\n\\(Catholicism\\)\") [Stephen Langton](/wiki/Stephen_Langton \"Stephen Langton\"),\nthe first of [English cardinals](/wiki/English_cardinals \"English cardinals\")\nand later Archbishop of Canterbury (1208–28), became a pivotal figure in the\ndispute between [King John](/wiki/John_of_England \"John of England\") and [Pope\nInnocent III](/wiki/Pope_Innocent_III \"Pope Innocent III\"). This critical\nsituation led to the signing and later promulgation of the [Magna\nCharta](/wiki/Magna_Charta \"Magna Charta\") in 1215.\n\n### Protestantism and Catholic\nResistance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Protestantism and Catholic Resistance\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Banner_of_the_Holy_Wounds_%28Pilgrimage_of_Grace%29.svg/200px-\nBanner_of_the_Holy_Wounds_%28Pilgrimage_of_Grace%29.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Banner_of_the_Holy_Wounds_\\(Pilgrimage_of_Grace\\).svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Banner_of_the_Holy_Wounds_\\(Pilgrimage_of_Grace\\).svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA banner showing the [Holy Wounds](/wiki/Holy_Wounds \"Holy Wounds\") of [Jesus\nChrist](/wiki/Jesus_Christ \"Jesus Christ\") which was carried by partisans\nduring the [Pilgrimage of Grace](/wiki/Pilgrimage_of_Grace \"Pilgrimage of\nGrace\").\n\nEngland remained a Catholic country until 1534, when it first officially\nseparated from Rome during the reign of [King Henry\nVIII](/wiki/King_Henry_VIII \"King Henry VIII\"). In response to the Pope's\nrefusal to annul Henry's marriage to [Catherine of\nAragon](/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon \"Catherine of Aragon\"), Parliament denied\nthe Pope's authority over the English Church, made the king Head of the Church\nin England, and dissolved the monasteries and religious orders in England.\nHenry did not himself accept [Protestant](/wiki/Protestant \"Protestant\")\ninnovations in doctrine or liturgy – but he extended toleration, and even\npromotion, to clergy with Protestant sympathies in return for support for his\nbreak with Rome. On the other hand, failure to accept this break, particularly\nby prominent persons in church and state, was regarded by Henry as treason,\nresulting in the execution of [Thomas More](/wiki/Thomas_More \"Thomas More\"),\nformer Lord Chancellor, and [John Fisher](/wiki/John_Fisher \"John Fisher\"),\n[Bishop of Rochester](/wiki/Bishop_of_Rochester \"Bishop of Rochester\"), among\nothers. The [See of Rome Act 1536](/wiki/See_of_Rome_Act_1536 \"See of Rome Act\n1536\") enforced the separation from Rome, while the '[Pilgrimage of\nGrace](/wiki/Pilgrimage_of_Grace \"Pilgrimage of Grace\")' of 1536 and '[Bigod's\nRebellion](/wiki/Bigod%27s_Rebellion \"Bigod's Rebellion\")' of 1537, risings in\nthe North against the religious changes, were bloodily repressed.\n\nIn 1536-41 Henry VIII engaged in a large-scale [Dissolution of the\nMonasteries](/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries \"Dissolution of the\nMonasteries\"), which controlled most of the wealth of the church, and much of\nthe richest land. He disbanded [monasteries](/wiki/Monasteries \"Monasteries\"),\n[priories](/wiki/Priory \"Priory\"), [convents](/wiki/Convent \"Convent\") and\n[friaries](/wiki/Friaries \"Friaries\") in England, Wales and Ireland,\nappropriated their income, disposed of their assets, and provided pensions for\nthe former residents. He did not turn these properties over to a Protestant\nchurch of England (which indeed did not yet exist): they were sold, mostly to\npay for the wars. The historian G. W. Bernard argues:\n\n    The dissolution of the monasteries in the late 1530s was one of the most revolutionary events in English history. There were nearly 900 religious houses in England, around 260 for monks, 300 for regular canons, 142 nunneries and 183 friaries; some 12,000 people in total, 4,000 monks, 3,000 canons, 3,000 friars and 2,000 nuns....one adult man in fifty was in religious orders.[26]\n\nNevertheless, Henry maintained a strong preference for traditional Catholic\npractices and, during his reign, Protestant reformers were unable to make many\nchanges to the practices of the Church of England. Indeed, this part of\nHenry's reign saw the trial for heresy of Protestants as well as Catholics.\n\nThe 1547 to 1553 reign of the boy [King Edward VI](/wiki/King_Edward_VI \"King\nEdward VI\") saw the Church of England become more influenced by Protestantism\nin its faith and worship, with the (Latin) [Mass](/wiki/Mass \"Mass\") replaced\nby the (English) [Book of Common Prayer](/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer \"Book of\nCommon Prayer\"), representational art and statues in church buildings\ndestroyed, and Catholic practices which had survived during Henry's reign, for\ninstance the public saying of prayers to the Virgin Mary such as the [Salve\nRegina](/wiki/Salve_Regina \"Salve Regina\"), ended. The Western Rising took\nplace in 1549.\n\nThe institutional Church in England returned to Catholic practice during the\nreign of the Catholic [Queen Mary I](/wiki/Mary_I_of_England \"Mary I of\nEngland\") from 1553 to 1558. Mary was determined to bring back the whole of\nEngland to the Catholic faith. This aim was not necessarily at odds with the\nfeeling of a large section of the populace; Edward's Protestant reformation\nhad not been well received everywhere, and there was ambiguity in the\nresponses of the parishes.[27] Mary also had some powerful families behind\nher. The Jerningham family together with other East Anglian Catholic families\nsuch as the Bedingfelds, Waldegraves, Rochesters together with the Huddlestons\nof Sawston Hall were \"the key to Queen Mary's successful accession to the\nthrone. Without them she would never have made it.\"[28] However, Mary's\nexecutions of 300 Protestants by burning at the stake proved\ncounterproductive, as they were extremely unpopular among the populace. For\nexample, instead of executing Archbishop Cranmer for treason for supporting\n[Queen Jane](/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey \"Lady Jane Grey\"), she had him tried for\nheresy and burned at a stake.[29][30] With the assistance of _[Foxe's Book of\nMartyrs](/wiki/Foxe%27s_Book_of_Martyrs \"Foxe's Book of Martyrs\")_, which\nglorified the Protestants killed at the time and vilified Catholics,[31] this\npractice ensured her a place in popular memory as _Bloody Mary_ – for\ncenturies after the idea of another reconciliation with Rome was linked in\nmany English people's minds with a renewal of Mary's fiery stakes.\n\nWhen Mary died and [Elizabeth I](/wiki/Elizabeth_I \"Elizabeth I\") became queen\nin 1558, the religious situation in England was confused. Throughout the see-\nsawing religious landscape of the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, and Mary I,\na significant proportion of the population (especially in the rural and\noutlying areas of the country), are likely to have continued to hold Catholic\nviews, at least in private. By the end of Elizabeth I's reign, however,\nEngland was clearly a Protestant country, and Catholics were a minority.\n\nElizabeth's first act was to reverse her sister's re-establishment of\nCatholicism by [Acts of Supremacy and\nUniformity](/wiki/Elizabethan_Religious_Settlement \"Elizabethan Religious\nSettlement\"). [The Act of Supremacy of 1558](/wiki/Act_of_Supremacy_1558 \"Act\nof Supremacy 1558\") made it a crime to assert the authority of any foreign\nprince, [prelate](/wiki/Prelate \"Prelate\"), or other authority, and was aimed\nat abolishing the authority of the [Pope](/wiki/Pope \"Pope\") in England. A\nthird offence was [high treason](/wiki/High_treason \"High treason\"),\npunishable by death. The [Oath of Supremacy](/wiki/Oath_of_Supremacy \"Oath of\nSupremacy\"), imposed by the Act of Supremacy 1558, provided for any person\ntaking public or church office in [England](/wiki/England \"England\") to swear\nallegiance to the monarch as [Supreme Governor](/wiki/Supreme_Governor\n\"Supreme Governor\") of the [Church of England](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church\nof England\"). Failure to so swear was a crime, although it did not become\ntreason until 1562, when the **Supremacy of the Crown Act 1562**[32] made a\nsecond offence of refusing to take the oath treason.\n\nHowever, during the first years of her reign there was relative leniency\ntowards Catholics who were willing to keep their religion private, especially\nif they were prepared to continue to attend their parish churches. The wording\nof the official prayer book had been carefully designed to make this possible\nby omitting aggressively \"heretical\" matter, and at first many English\nCatholics did in fact worship with their Protestant neighbours, at least until\nthis was formally forbidden by [Pope Pius V](/wiki/Pope_Pius_V \"Pope Pius\nV\")'s 1570 bull, _[Regnans in Excelsis](/wiki/Regnans_in_Excelsis \"Regnans in\nExcelsis\")_ , which also declared that Elizabeth was not a rightful queen and\nshould be deposed, formally excommunicated her and any who obeyed her and\nobliged all Catholics to attempt to overthrow her.[33]\n\nIn response, the \"Act to retain the Queen's Majesty's subjects in their\nobedience\", passed in 1581, made it high treason to reconcile anyone or to be\nreconciled to \"the Romish religion\", or to procure or publish any papal Bull\nor writing whatsoever. The celebration of mass was prohibited under penalty of\na fine of two hundred marks and imprisonment for one year for the celebrant,\nand a fine of one hundred marks and the same imprisonment for those who heard\nthe Mass. This act also increased the penalty for not attending the Anglican\nservice to the sum of twenty pounds a month, or imprisonment till the fine be\npaid, or till the offender went to the Protestant Church. A further penalty of\nten pounds a month was inflicted on anyone keeping a schoolmaster who did not\nattend the Protestant service. The schoolmaster himself was to be imprisoned\nfor one year.[34]\n\nIn the setting of England's wars with Catholic powers such as France and\nSpain, culminating in the attempted invasion by the [Spanish\nArmada](/wiki/Spanish_Armada \"Spanish Armada\") in 1588, the Papal bull\nunleashed a nationalistic feeling which equated Protestantism with loyalty to\na highly popular monarch, rendering every Catholic a potential traitor, even\nin the eyes of those who were not themselves extreme Protestants. The [Rising\nof the North](/wiki/Rising_of_the_North \"Rising of the North\"), the\n[Throckmorton plot](/wiki/Throckmorton_plot \"Throckmorton plot\") and the\n[Babington plot](/wiki/Babington_plot \"Babington plot\"), together with other\nsubversive activities of supporters of [Mary, Queen of\nScots](/wiki/Mary,_Queen_of_Scots \"Mary, Queen of Scots\"), all reinforced the\nassociation of Catholicism and treachery in the popular mind.\n\nThe climax of Elizabeth's persecution of Catholics was reached in 1585 by the\n\"[Act against Jesuits, Seminary priests and other such like disobedient\npersons](/wiki/Act_against_Jesuits,_Seminary_priests_and_other_such_like_disobedient_persons\n\"Act against Jesuits, Seminary priests and other such like disobedient\npersons\")\". This statute, under which most of the [English Catholic\nmartyrs](/wiki/List_of_Catholic_martyrs_of_the_English_Reformation \"List of\nCatholic martyrs of the English Reformation\") were executed, made it high\ntreason for any Jesuit or any seminary priest to be in England at all, and\nfelony for any one to harbour or relieve them.\n\nThe last of Elizabeth's anti-Catholic laws was the \"Act for the better\ndiscovery of wicked and seditious persons terming themselves Catholics, but\nbeing rebellious and traitorous subjects\". Its effect was to prohibit all\n[recusants](/wiki/Recusants \"Recusants\") from removing more than five miles\nfrom their place of abode, and to order all persons suspected of being Jesuits\nor seminary priests, and not answering satisfactorily, to be imprisoned till\nthey did so.[35]\n\nHowever, Elizabeth did not believe that her anti-Catholic policies constituted\nreligious persecution, finding it hard, in the context of the uncompromising\nwording of the Papal Bull against her, to distinguish between those Catholics\nengaged in conflict with her from those Catholics with no such designs.[36]\nThe number of English Catholics executed under Elizabeth was significant,\nincluding [Edmund Campion](/wiki/Edmund_Campion \"Edmund Campion\"), [Robert\nSouthwell](/wiki/Robert_Southwell_\\(jesuit\\) \"Robert Southwell \\(jesuit\\)\"),\nand [Margaret Clitherow](/wiki/Margaret_Clitherow \"Margaret Clitherow\").\nElizabeth herself signed the death warrant that led to\n[regicide](/wiki/Regicide \"Regicide\"), the beheading of her cousin, Mary,\nQueen of Scots.\n\nBecause of the persecution in England, Catholic priests in England were\ntrained abroad at the [English College in Rome](/wiki/English_College \"English\nCollege\"), the [English College in Douai](/wiki/English_College,_Douai\n\"English College, Douai\"), the [English College at Valladolid in\nSpain](/wiki/English_College,_Valladolid \"English College, Valladolid\"), and\nat the English College in Seville. Given that Douai was located in the\n[Spanish Netherlands](/wiki/Spanish_Netherlands \"Spanish Netherlands\"), part\nof the dominions of Elizabethan England's greatest enemy, and Valladolid and\nSeville in Spain itself, they became associated in the public eye with\npolitical as well as religious subversion. It was this combination of\nnationalistic public opinion, sustained persecution, and the rise of a new\ngeneration which could not remember pre-Reformation times and had no pre-\nestablished loyalty to Catholicism, that reduced the number of Catholics in\nEngland during this period – although the overshadowing memory of Queen Mary\nI's reign was another factor that should not be underestimated. Nevertheless,\nby the end of the reign probably 20% of the population were still Catholic,\nwith another 10% dissident \"Puritan\" Protestants, and the remainder more or\nless reconciled to the \"official\" church.\n\nThe reign of [James I](/wiki/James_I_of_England \"James I of England\")\n(1603–1625) was marked by a measure of tolerance, though less so after the\ndiscovery of the [Gunpowder Plot](/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot \"Gunpowder Plot\")\nconspiracy of a small group of Catholic conspirators who aimed to kill both\nKing and Parliament and establish a Catholic monarchy. A mix of persecution\nand tolerance followed: [Ben Jonson](/wiki/Ben_Jonson \"Ben Jonson\") and his\nwife, for example, in 1606 were summoned before the authorities for failure to\ntake communion in the Church of England,[37] yet the King tolerated some\nCatholics at court; for example George Calvert, to whom he gave the title\n[Baron Baltimore](/wiki/Baron_Baltimore \"Baron Baltimore\"), and the [Duke of\nNorfolk](/wiki/Duke_of_Norfolk \"Duke of Norfolk\"), head of the [Howard\nfamily](/wiki/Howard_family \"Howard family\").\n\nThe reign of [Charles I](/wiki/Charles_I_of_England \"Charles I of England\")\n(1625–49) saw a small revival of Catholicism in England, especially among the\nupper classes. As part of the royal marriage settlement Charles's Catholic\nwife, [Henrietta Maria](/wiki/Henrietta_Maria \"Henrietta Maria\"), was\npermitted her own royal chapel and chaplain. Henrietta Maria was in fact very\nstrict in her religious observances, and helped create a court with\ncontinental influences, where Catholicism was tolerated, even somewhat\nfashionable. Some anti-Catholic legislation became effectively a dead letter.\nThe [Counter-Reformation](/wiki/Counter-Reformation \"Counter-Reformation\") on\nthe Continent of Europe had created a more vigorous and magnificent form of\nCatholicism (i.e., [Baroque](/wiki/Baroque \"Baroque\"), notably found in the\narchitecture and music of Austria, Italy and Germany) that attracted some\nconverts, like the poet [Richard Crashaw](/wiki/Richard_Crashaw \"Richard\nCrashaw\"). Ironically, the explicitly Catholic artistic movement (i.e.,\nBaroque) ended up \"providing the blueprint, after the fire of London, for the\nfirst new Protestant churches to be built in England.\"[38]\n\nWhile Charles remained firmly Protestant, he was personally drawn towards a\nconsciously 'High Church' Anglicanism. This affected his appointments to\nAnglican bishoprics, in particular the appointment of [William\nLaud](/wiki/William_Laud \"William Laud\") as [Archbishop of\nCanterbury](/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury \"Archbishop of Canterbury\"). How\nmany Catholics and Puritans there were is still open to debate.[39][40]\n\nReligious conflict between Charles and other \"High\" Anglicans and\n[Calvinists](/wiki/Calvinists \"Calvinists\") \\- at this stage mostly still\nwithin the Church of England (the [Puritans](/wiki/Puritans \"Puritans\")) -\nformed a strand of the anti-monarchical leanings of the troubled politics of\nthe period. The religious tensions between a court with 'Papist' elements and\na Parliament where the Puritans were strong was one of the major factors\nbehind the [English Civil War](/wiki/English_Civil_War \"English Civil War\"),\nin which almost all Catholics supported the King. The victory of the\nParliamentarians meant a strongly Protestant, anti-Catholic (and,\nincidentally, anti-Anglican) regime under [Oliver\nCromwell](/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell \"Oliver Cromwell\").\n\nThe restoration of the monarchy under [Charles II](/wiki/Charles_II_of_England\n\"Charles II of England\") (1660–85) also saw the restoration of a Catholic-\ninfluenced court like his father's. However, although Charles himself had\nCatholic leanings, he was first and foremost a pragmatist and realised the\nvast majority of public opinion in England was strongly anti-Catholic, so he\nagreed to laws such as the Test Act requiring any appointee to any public\noffice or member of Parliament to deny Catholic beliefs such as\n[transubstantiation](/wiki/Transubstantiation \"Transubstantiation\"). As far as\npossible, however, he maintained tacit tolerance. Like his father, he married\na Catholic, [Catherine of Braganza](/wiki/Catherine_of_Braganza \"Catherine of\nBraganza\"). (He would become Catholic himself on his deathbed).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/James_II_%28Ann_Killigrew%29.jpg/190px-\nJames_II_%28Ann_Killigrew%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:James_II_\\(Ann_Killigrew\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:James_II_\\(Ann_Killigrew\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[James II](/wiki/James_II_of_England \"James II of England\") was the last\nCatholic to have reigned as monarch of England.\n\nCharles' brother and heir James, Duke of York (later [James\nII](/wiki/James_II_of_England \"James II of England\")) converted to Catholicism\nin 1668–1669. When [Titus Oates](/wiki/Titus_Oates \"Titus Oates\") in 1678\nalleged a (totally imaginary) '[Popish Plot](/wiki/Popish_Plot \"Popish Plot\")'\nto assassinate Charles and put James in his place, he unleashed a wave of\nParliamentary and public hysteria which led to anti-Catholic purges, and\nanother wave of sectarian persecution, which Charles was either unable or\nunwilling to prevent. Throughout the early 1680s the\n[Whig](/wiki/British_Whig_Party \"British Whig Party\") element in Parliament\nattempted to remove James as successor to the throne. Their failure saw James\nbecome, in 1685, Britain's first openly Catholic monarch since [Mary\nI](/wiki/Mary_I_of_England \"Mary I of England\") (and last to date). He\npromised religious toleration for Catholic and Protestants on an equal\nfooting, but it is in doubt whether he did this to gain support from\n[Dissenters](/wiki/Dissenters \"Dissenters\") or whether he was truly committed\nto tolerance (Contemporary Catholic regimes in Spain and Italy, for example,\nwere hardly tolerant of Protestantism, while those in France and Poland had\npractised forms of toleration).[41][42]\n\nJames' clear intent to work towards the restoration of the Church of England\nto the Catholic fold encouraged converts like the poet [John\nDryden](/wiki/John_Dryden \"John Dryden\"), who wrote \"[The Hind and the\nPanther](/wiki/The_Hind_and_the_Panther \"The Hind and the Panther\")\",\ncelebrating his conversion.[43][44] Protestant fears mounted as James placed\nCatholics in the major commands of the existing standing army, dismissed the\nProtestant Bishop of London and dismissed the Protestant Fellows of Magdalen\nCollege and replaced them with a wholly Catholic board. The last straw was the\nbirth of a Catholic heir in 1688, portending a return to a Pre-Reformation\nCatholic dynasty.\n\nIn what came to be known as the [Glorious\nRevolution](/wiki/Glorious_Revolution \"Glorious Revolution\"), Parliament\ndeemed James to have abdicated (effectively deposing him, though Parliament\nrefused to call it that) in favor of his Protestant daughter and son-in-law\nand nephew, [Mary II](/wiki/Mary_II_of_England \"Mary II of England\") and\n[William III](/wiki/William_III_of_England \"William III of England\"). Although\nthis affair is celebrated as solidifying both English liberties and the\nProtestant nature of the kingdom, some argue that it was \"fundamentally a coup\nspearheaded by a foreign army and navy.\"[45][46][47]\n\nJames fled into exile, and with him many Catholic nobility and gentry. The\n[Act of Settlement 1701](/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701 \"Act of Settlement\n1701\"), which remains in operation today, established the royal line through\nSophia, Electress of Hanover, and specifically excludes any Catholic or anyone\nwho marries a Catholic from the throne. This Act was partially changed when\nthe ban on the monarch's marrying a Catholic was eliminated (along with the\nrule of male succession).[48]\n\n[Henry Benedict Stuart](/wiki/Henry_Benedict_Stuart \"Henry Benedict Stuart\")\n(Cardinal-Duke of York), the last [Jacobite](/wiki/Jacobitism \"Jacobitism\")\nheir to publicly assert a claim to the thrones of England, Scotland, and\nIreland, died in Rome in 1807.

Deprived of their dioceses, four [Apostolic\nVicariates](/wiki/Apostolic_Vicariate \"Apostolic Vicariate\") were set up\nthroughout England until the re-establishment of the diocesan episcopacy in\n1850. Although the persecution was not violent as in the past, Catholic\nnumbers, influence and visibility in English society reached their lowest ebb.\nTheir civil rights were severely curtailed: their right to own property or\ninherit land was greatly limited, they were burdened with special taxes, they\ncould not send their children abroad for Catholic education, they could not\nvote, and priests were liable to imprisonment.\n\nThere was no longer, as once in Stuart times, any notable Catholic presence at\ncourt, in public life, in the military or professions. Many of the Catholic\nnobles and gentry who had preserved on their lands among their tenants small\npockets of Catholicism had followed James into exile, and others, at least\noutwardly, conformed to Anglicanism, meaning fewer such Catholic communities\nsurvived intact. A bishop at this time (roughly from 1688 to 1850) was called\na [Vicar apostolic](/wiki/Vicar_apostolic \"Vicar apostolic\"). A Vicar\nApostolic was a [titular bishop](/wiki/Titular_bishop \"Titular bishop\") (as\nopposed to a diocesan bishop) through whom the pope exercised jurisdiction\nover a [particular church](/wiki/Particular_church \"Particular church\")\nterritory in England. Interestingly, English-speaking\n[colonial](/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States \"Colonial history of\nthe United States\") America came under the jurisdiction of the [Vicar\nApostolic of the London](/wiki/Apostolic_Vicariate_of_the_London_District\n\"Apostolic Vicariate of the London District\"). As [titular\nbishop](/wiki/Titular_bishop \"Titular bishop\") over Catholics in British\nAmerica, he was important to the government not only in regard to its English-\nspeaking North American colonies, but also after the [Seven Years'\nWar](/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War \"Seven Years' War\") when the [British\nEmpire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\"), in 1763, acquired the French-\nspeaking (and predominantly Catholic) territory of Canada. Only after the\n[Treaty of Paris](/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\\(1783\\) \"Treaty of Paris \\(1783\\)\")\nin 1783 and in 1789 with the consecration of [John\nCarroll](/wiki/John_Carroll_\\(bishop\\) \"John Carroll \\(bishop\\)\"), a friend of\n[Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin Franklin\"), did the U.S.\nhave its own diocesan bishop, free of the Vicar Apostolic of London, James\nRobert Talbot.[51][52][53][54][55]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Distribution_of_English_Recusant_Catholics%2C_1715-1720.png/200px-\nDistribution_of_English_Recusant_Catholics%2C_1715-1720.png)](/wiki/File:Distribution_of_English_Recusant_Catholics,_1715-1720.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Distribution_of_English_Recusant_Catholics,_1715-1720.png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nGeographical distribution of English Catholic Recusancy, 1715—1720.\n\nMost Catholics retreated to complete isolation from a popular Protestant\nmainstream, and Catholicism in England in this period is politically, if not\nsocially, invisible to history, [Alexander Pope](/wiki/Alexander_Pope\n\"Alexander Pope\") being one memorable English Catholic of the 18th century and\nthe other being a member of the Catholic gentry, the [Duke of\nNorfolk](/wiki/Duke_of_Norfolk \"Duke of Norfolk\"), the Premier\n[Duke](/wiki/Duke \"Duke\") in the [peerage](/wiki/Peerage \"Peerage\") of England\nand as [Earl of Arundel](/wiki/Earl_of_Arundel \"Earl of Arundel\"), the Premier\n[Earl](/wiki/Earl \"Earl\"). In virtue of his status and as head of the [Howard\nfamily](/wiki/Howard_family \"Howard family\") (which included the [Earl of\nCarlisle](/wiki/Earl_of_Carlisle \"Earl of Carlisle\"), the [Earl of\nSuffolk](/wiki/Earl_of_Suffolk \"Earl of Suffolk\"), the [Earl of\nBerkshire](/wiki/Earl_of_Berkshire \"Earl of Berkshire\"), and the [Earl of\nEffingham](/wiki/Earl_of_Effingham \"Earl of Effingham\")), the Duke was always\nat court. Pope, however, seemed to benefit from the isolation. In 1713, when\nhe was 25, he took subscriptions for a project that filled his life for the\nnext seven years, the result being a new version of Homer's\n[Iliad](/wiki/Iliad \"Iliad\"). [Samuel Johnson](/wiki/Samuel_Johnson \"Samuel\nJohnson\") pronounced it the greatest translation ever achieved in the English\nlanguage.[56] Over time, Pope became the greatest poet of the age, the\n[Augustan Age](/wiki/Augustan_poetry \"Augustan poetry\"), especially for his\nmock-heroic poems, [Rape of the Lock](/wiki/Rape_of_the_Lock \"Rape of the\nLock\") and [The Dunciad](/wiki/The_Dunciad \"The Dunciad\"). Around this time,\nin 1720, [Clement XI](/wiki/Clement_XI \"Clement XI\") proclaimed Anselm of\nCanterbury a [Doctor of the Church](/wiki/Doctor_of_the_Church \"Doctor of the\nChurch\"). In 1752, mid-century, Great Britain adopted the [Gregorian\ncalendar](/wiki/Gregorian_calendar \"Gregorian calendar\") decreed by Pope\n[Gregory XIII](/wiki/Gregory_XIII \"Gregory XIII\") in 1582. Later in the\ncentury there was some liberalisation of the anti-Catholic laws on the basis\nof Enlightenment ideals.\n\nIn 1778 a [Catholic Relief Act](/wiki/Papists_Act_1778 \"Papists Act 1778\")\nallowed Catholics to own property, inherit land and join the army. Hardline\nProtestant mobs reacted in the [Gordon Riots](/wiki/Gordon_Riots \"Gordon\nRiots\") in 1780, attacking any building in London which was associated with\nCatholicism or owned by Catholics. Other reforms allowed the clergy to operate\nmore openly and thus allowed permanent missions to be set up in the larger\ntowns. [Stonyhurst College](/wiki/Stonyhurst_College \"Stonyhurst College\"),\nfor example, was re-established in 1791 for wealthier Catholics. In 1837,\nJames Arundel, the tenth Baron Arundel of Wardour, bequeathed to Stonyhurst\nthe Arundel Library, which contained the vast Arundel family collection,\nincluding some of the school's most important books and manuscripts such as a\nShakespeare [First Folio](/wiki/First_Folio \"First Folio\") and a manuscript\ncopy of Froissart's _Chronicles_ , looted from the body of a dead Frenchman\nafter the [Battle of Agincourt](/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt \"Battle of\nAgincourt\"). Yet Catholic [recusants](/wiki/Recusants \"Recusants\") as a whole\nremained a small group, except where they stayed the majority religion in\nvarious pockets, notably in rural [Lancashire](/wiki/Lancashire \"Lancashire\")\nand [Cumbria](/wiki/Cumbria \"Cumbria\"), or were part of the Catholic\naristocracy and squirearchy.[57] One of the most interesting contemporary\ndescendents of recusants is [Timothy Radcliffe](/wiki/Timothy_Radcliffe\n\"Timothy Radcliffe\"), former Master of the Order of Preachers\n([Dominicans](/wiki/Dominican_Order \"Dominican Order\")) and writer. Radcliffe\nis related to three former cardinals—Weld, Vaughan and Hume (the last because\nhis cousin Lord Hunt is married to Hume's sister), and his family is connected\nto many of the great recusant English Catholic families, the Arundels,\nTichbournes, Tablots, Stonors, and Weld-Blundells.[58] Finally, history cannot\nforget the famous recusant, [Maria Fitzherbert](/wiki/Maria_Fitzherbert \"Maria\nFitzherbert\"), who during this period secretly married the [Prince of\nWales](/wiki/Prince_of_Wales \"Prince of Wales\"), [Prince\nRegent](/wiki/Prince_Regent \"Prince Regent\"), and future [George\nIV](/wiki/George_IV \"George IV\") in 1785. The [British\nConstitution](/wiki/British_Constitution \"British Constitution\"), however, did\nnot accept it and George IV later moved on. Cast aside by the establishment,\nshe was adopted by the town of Brighton, whose citizens, both Catholic and\nProtestant, called her \"Mrs. Prince\". According to journalist, Richard Abbott,\n\"Before the town had a [Catholic] church of its own, she had a priest say Mass\nat her own house, and invited local Catholics\", suggesting the recusants of\nBrighton were not very undiscovered.[59][60]\n\nIn a new study of the English Catholic community, 1688–1745, Gabriel Glickman\nnotes that Catholics, especially those whose social position gave them access\nto the courtly centres of power and patronage, had a significant part to play\nin 18th-century England. They were not as marginal as one might think today.\nFor example, Alexander Pope was not the only Catholic whose contributions\n(especially, _Essays on Man_) help define the temper of an early English\nEnlightenment. In addition to Pope, Glickman notes, a Catholic architect,\n[James Gibbs](/wiki/James_Gibbs \"James Gibbs\"), returned baroque forms to the\nLondon skyline and a Catholic composer, [Thomas Arne](/wiki/Thomas_Arne\n\"Thomas Arne\"), composed \"Rule Britannia.\" According to reviewer Aidan\nBellenger, Glickman also suggests that \"rather than being the victims of the\nStuart failure, 'the unpromising setting of exile and defeat' had 'sown the\nseed of a frail but resilient English Catholic Enlightenment.'\"[61] Yale\nUniversity historian Steve Pincus likewise argues in his book, _1688: The\nFirst Modern Revolution_ , that Catholics under William and Mary and their\nsuccessors experienced considerable freedom.[62]\n\n### Coming of the Irish and English\nconverts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Coming of the Irish and English converts\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Statue_Cardinal_Newman%2C_Brompton_Oratory.jpg/200px-\nStatue_Cardinal_Newman%2C_Brompton_Oratory.jpg)](/wiki/File:Statue_Cardinal_Newman,_Brompton_Oratory.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Statue_Cardinal_Newman,_Brompton_Oratory.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nStatue of [Cardinal Newman](/wiki/Cardinal_Newman \"Cardinal Newman\") outside\nthe Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, London\n\nAfter this moribund period, the first signs of a revival occurred as thousands\nof French Catholics fled France during the [French\nRevolution](/wiki/French_Revolution \"French Revolution\"). The leaders of the\nRevolution were virulently anti-Catholic, even singling out priests and nuns\nfor summary execution or massacre, and England was seen as a safe haven from\n[Jacobin](/wiki/Jacobin_\\(politics\\) \"Jacobin \\(politics\\)\") violence. Also\naround this time (1801), a new political entity was formed, the [United\nKingdom of Great Britain and\nIreland](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland \"United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Ireland\"), which merged the Kingdom of Great Britain with\nthe [Kingdom of Ireland](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland \"Kingdom of Ireland\"), thus\nincreasing the number of Catholics in the new state. Pressure for abolition of\nanti-Catholic laws grew, particularly with the need for Catholic recruits to\nfight in the [Napoleonic Wars](/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars \"Napoleonic Wars\").\nDespite the strong opposition of King [George III](/wiki/George_III \"George\nIII\"), which delayed reform, 1829 brought the culmination of the\nliberalisation of the anti-Catholic laws.[63] Parliament passed the [Roman\nCatholic Relief Act 1829](/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Relief_Act_1829 \"Roman Catholic\nRelief Act 1829\"), giving Catholics almost equal civil rights, including the\nright to vote and to hold most public offices. If Catholics were rich,\nhowever, exceptions were always made, even before the changes. For example,\nAmerican ministers to the [Court of St. James's](/wiki/Court_of_St._James%27s\n\"Court of St. James's\") were often struck by the prominence of wealthy\nAmerican-born Catholics, titled ladies among the nobility, like Louisa\n(Caton), granddaughter of [Charles Carroll of\nCarrollton](/wiki/Charles_Carroll_of_Carrollton \"Charles Carroll of\nCarrollton\"), and her two sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth. After Louisa's\nfirst husband (Sir Felton Bathurst-Hervey) died, Louisa later married the\n[son](/wiki/Francis_D%27Arcy-Osborne,_7th_Duke_of_Leeds \"Francis D'Arcy-\nOsborne, 7th Duke of Leeds\") of the Duke of Leeds, and had the [Duke of\nWellington](/wiki/Duke_of_Wellington \"Duke of Wellington\") as her European\nprotector. Her sister, Mary Ann, married the Marquess of Wellesley, the\nbrother of the Duke of Wellington; and her other sister, Elizabeth (Lady\nStafford), married another British nobleman.[64][65][66][67] Though British\nlaw required an Anglican marriage service, each of the sisters and their\nProtestant spouses had a Catholic ceremony afterwards. At Louisa's first\nmarriage, the Duke of Wellington escorted the bride.[68]\n\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, especially during the [Great Irish\nFamine](/wiki/Great_Irish_Famine \"Great Irish Famine\"), while much of the\nlarge outflow of emigration from Ireland was headed to the United States to\nseek work, hundreds of thousands of Irish people also migrated across the\nchannel to England and Scotland, and established communities in cities there,\nincluding London, [Liverpool](/wiki/Liverpool \"Liverpool\"),\n[Manchester](/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\") and [Glasgow](/wiki/Glasgow\n\"Glasgow\"), but also in towns and villages up and down the country, thus\ngiving English Catholicism a numerical boost. Also significant was the rise in\nthe 1830s and 1840s of the [Oxford Movement](/wiki/Oxford_Movement \"Oxford\nMovement\"), which claimed Catholic validity for Anglican orders and sought to\nrevive some elements of Catholic theology and ritual within the Church of\nEngland (creating [Anglo-Catholicism](/wiki/Anglo-Catholicism \"Anglo-\nCatholicism\")).\n\nA proportion of the Anglicans who were involved in the Oxford Movement or\n\"Tractarianism\" were ultimately led beyond these positions and converted to\nthe Catholic Church, including, in 1845, the movement's principal intellectual\nleader, [John Henry Newman](/wiki/John_Henry_Newman \"John Henry Newman\"). More\nnew Catholics would come from the Anglican Church, often via high Anglicanism,\nfor at least the next hundred years, and something of this continues.\n\nProminent intellectual and artistic figures who turned to Catholicism in the\n19th and 20th centuries included the leading architect of the [Gothic\nRevival](/wiki/Gothic_Revival \"Gothic Revival\"), [Augustus\nPugin](/wiki/Augustus_Pugin \"Augustus Pugin\"), the artist [Graham\nSutherland](/wiki/Graham_Sutherland \"Graham Sutherland\") and literary figures\nsuch as Newman, [Gerard Manley Hopkins](/wiki/Gerard_Manley_Hopkins \"Gerard\nManley Hopkins\"), [G. K. Chesterton](/wiki/G._K._Chesterton \"G. K.\nChesterton\"), [Ronald Knox](/wiki/Ronald_Knox \"Ronald Knox\"), [Siegfried\nSassoon](/wiki/Siegfried_Sassoon \"Siegfried Sassoon\"), [Evelyn\nWaugh](/wiki/Evelyn_Waugh \"Evelyn Waugh\"), [Edith Sitwell](/wiki/Edith_Sitwell\n\"Edith Sitwell\"), [Graham Greene](/wiki/Graham_Greene \"Graham Greene\") and\n[Muriel Spark](/wiki/Muriel_Spark \"Muriel Spark\").[69] Prominent cradle\nCatholics included the film director, [Alfred\nHitchcock](/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock \"Alfred Hitchcock\"), writers such as\n[Hilaire Belloc](/wiki/Hilaire_Belloc \"Hilaire Belloc\"), [Lord\nActon](/wiki/Lord_Acton \"Lord Acton\"), and [J. R. R.\nTolkien](/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien \"J. R. R. Tolkien\") and the composer [Edward\nElgar](/wiki/Edward_Elgar \"Edward Elgar\"), whose oratorio _[The Dream of\nGerontius](/wiki/The_Dream_of_Gerontius \"The Dream of Gerontius\")_ was based\non a 19th-century poem by Newman.\n\nAt various points after the 16th century hopes have been entertained by many\nEnglish Catholics that the \"reconversion of England\" was near at hand.\nAdditionally, with the arrival of immigrant masses of Irish Catholics, some\nconsidered that a \"second spring\" of Catholicism across Britain was\ndeveloping. Rome responded by [re-establishing the Catholic hierarchy in\n1850](/wiki/Universalis_Ecclesiae \"Universalis Ecclesiae\"), creating 12\nCatholic dioceses in England from existing [apostolic\nvicariates](/wiki/Apostolic_vicariates \"Apostolic vicariates\") and appointing\ndiocesan bishops (to replace earlier [titular bishops](/wiki/Titular_bishop\n\"Titular bishop\")) with fixed sees on a more traditional Catholic pattern. The\nCatholic Church in England and Wales had 22 dioceses immediately before the\nReformation, but none of the current 22 bear close resemblance\n(geographically) to those 22 earlier pre-Reformation dioceses.\n\nThe re-established diocesan episcopacy specifically avoided using places that\nwere seats of Church of England dioceses as seats, in effect temporarily\nabandoning the titles of Catholic dioceses before Elizabeth I because of the\n[Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851](/wiki/Ecclesiastical_Titles_Act_of_1851\n\"Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851\"), which in England favoured a state church\n(i.e., Church of England) and denied arms and legal existence to territorial\nCatholic sees on the basis that the state could not grant such \"privileges\" to\n\"entities\" that allegedly did not exist. Some of the Catholic dioceses,\nhowever, took the titles of bishoprics which had previously existed in England\nbut were no longer used by the Anglican Church (e.g. Beverley - later divided\ninto Leeds and Middlesbrough, Hexham - later changed to Hexham and Newcastle).\nIn the few cases where a Catholic diocese bears the same title as an Anglican\none in the same town or city (e.g. Birmingham, Liverpool, Portsmouth, and\nSouthwark) — this is the result of the [Church of\nEngland](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of England\") ignoring the prior\nexistence there of a Catholic see and of the technical repeal of the\nEcclesiastical Titles Act in 1871. Of course, the Act was only carried out in\nEngland. For example, the official recognition afforded by the grant of arms\nto the archdiocese of St. Andrews and Edinburgh, brought into being by Lord\nLyon in 1989, was made on the grounds that the Ecclesiastical Titles Act of\n1851 never applied to Scotland.[70] In recent times, former Conservative\nCabinent Minister, [John Gummer](/wiki/John_Gummer \"John Gummer\"), who is a\nprominent convert to Catholicism and columnist for the [Catholic\nHerald](/wiki/Catholic_Herald \"Catholic Herald\") in 2007, objected to the fact\nthat no Catholic diocese can have the same name as an Anglican diocese (such\nas London, Canterbury, Durham, etc.) \"even though those dioceses had, shall we\nsay, been borrowed.\"[71]\n\n### Contemporary English\nCatholicism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Contemporary English Catholicism\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral_at_dusk_%28reduced_grain%29%2C_corrected_perspective.jpg/200px-\nLiverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral_at_dusk_%28reduced_grain%29%2C_corrected_perspective.jpg)](/wiki/File:Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral_at_dusk_\\(reduced_grain\\),_corrected_perspective.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral_at_dusk_\\(reduced_grain\\),_corrected_perspective.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral](/wiki/Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral\n\"Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral\"), Liverpool\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Vatican_flag_half-\nmast_Oxford_20050403.jpg/220px-Vatican_flag_half-\nmast_Oxford_20050403.jpg)](/wiki/File:Vatican_flag_half-\nmast_Oxford_20050403.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Vatican_flag_half-mast_Oxford_20050403.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Oratory Church of St Aloysius\nGonzaga](/wiki/Oratory_Church_of_St_Aloysius_Gonzaga \"Oratory Church of St\nAloysius Gonzaga\"), Oxford, with the flag of the Vatican City flying at half\nstaff the day after the death of [Pope John Paul II](/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II\n\"Pope John Paul II\").\n\nEnglish Catholicism continued to grow throughout the first two thirds of the\n20th century, when it was associated primarily with elements in the English\nintellectual class and the ethnic Irish population. Numbers attending Mass\nremained very high in stark contrast with the Anglican church (although not to\nother Protestant churches),[72] Clergy numbers, which began the 20th century\nat under 3,000, reached a high of 7,500 in 1971.[73]\n\nBy the latter years of the twentieth century low numbers of vocations also\naffected the church[74] with ordinations to the priesthood dropping from the\nhundreds in the late 20th century into the teens in 2006-2011 (16 in 2009 for\nexample) and a recovery into the 20's thereafter, with a prediction for 2018\nof 24.[75][76][77]\n\nAs in other English-speaking countries such as the United States and\nAustralia, the movement of Irish Catholics out of the working-class into the\nmiddle-class suburban mainstream often meant their assimilation with broader,\nsecular English society and loss of a separate Catholic identity. The [Second\nVatican Council](/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council \"Second Vatican Council\") has\nbeen followed, as in other Western countries, by divisions between traditional\nCatholicism and a more liberal form of Catholicism claiming inspiration from\nthe Council. This caused difficulties for not a few pre-conciliar converts,\nthough others have still joined the Church in recent decades (for instance,\n[Malcolm Muggeridge](/wiki/Malcolm_Muggeridge \"Malcolm Muggeridge\") and\n[Joseph Pearce](/wiki/Joseph_Pearce \"Joseph Pearce\")), and public figures\n(often descendants of the recusant families) such as [Paul\nJohnson](/wiki/Paul_Johnson_\\(writer\\) \"Paul Johnson \\(writer\\)\"); [Peter\nAckroyd](/wiki/Peter_Ackroyd \"Peter Ackroyd\"); [Antonia\nFraser](/wiki/Antonia_Fraser \"Antonia Fraser\"); [Mark\nThompson](/wiki/Mark_Thompson_\\(television_executive\\) \"Mark Thompson\n\\(television executive\\)\"), [Director General of the\nBBC](/wiki/Director_General_of_the_BBC \"Director General of the BBC\");\n[Michael Martin](/wiki/Michael_Martin_\\(politician\\) \"Michael Martin\n\\(politician\\)\"), first Catholic to hold the office of\n[Speaker](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_\\(UK\\) \"Speaker of the House\nof Commons \\(UK\\)\") of the [House of\nCommons](/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom \"House of Commons of the\nUnited Kingdom\") since the Reformation; [Chris Patten](/wiki/Chris_Patten\n\"Chris Patten\"), first Catholic to hold the post of\n[Chancellor](/wiki/Chancellor \"Chancellor\") of Oxford since the Reformation;\n[Piers Paul Read](/wiki/Piers_Paul_Read \"Piers Paul Read\"); Helen Liddel,\nBritain's High Commissioner to Australia; and former Prime Minister's wife,\n[Cherie Blair](/wiki/Cherie_Blair \"Cherie Blair\"), have no difficulty making\ntheir Catholicism known in public life.

But the descendants of the\n[recusant](/wiki/Recusant \"Recusant\") families are still a force in the\nland.\"[79][80][81]\n\nSince the Council the Church in England has tended to focus on ecumenical\ndialogue with the Anglican Church rather than winning converts from it as in\nthe past.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] However, the 1990s have seen a number of\nconversions from Anglicanism to the Catholic Church, largely prompted by the\nChurch of England's decision to ordain women as priests (among other moves\naway from traditional doctrines and structures).[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nresultant converts included members of the Royal Family ([Katharine, Duchess\nof Kent](/wiki/Katharine,_Duchess_of_Kent \"Katharine, Duchess of Kent\"), her\nson [Lord Nicholas Windsor](/wiki/Lord_Nicholas_Windsor \"Lord Nicholas\nWindsor\") and her grandson [Baron Downpatrick](/wiki/Baron_Downpatrick \"Baron\nDownpatrick\")), a number of Anglican priests. Converts to Catholicism in\nBritain, for this reason, tend to be more conservative and even\n[traditionalist](/wiki/Traditionalist_Catholic \"Traditionalist Catholic\") than\nCatholics on the European mainland, often opposing trends within the Catholic\nChurch similar to those which induced them to abandon Anglicanism in the first\nplace.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nThe spirit of ecumenism fostered by Vatican II resulted in 1990 with the\nCatholic Church in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, joining [Churches\nTogether in Britain and\nIreland](/wiki/Churches_Together_in_Britain_and_Ireland \"Churches Together in\nBritain and Ireland\") as an expression of the churches' commitment to work\necumenically. Recently, for example, a memorial was put up to St [John\nHoughton](/wiki/John_Houghton_\\(martyr\\) \"John Houghton \\(martyr\\)\") and\nfellow [Carthusian](/wiki/Carthusian \"Carthusian\") monks martyred at the\n[London Charterhouse](/wiki/London_Charterhouse \"London Charterhouse\"), 1535.\nAnglican priest, Geoffrey Curtis, campaigned for it with the current\nArchbishop of Canterbury's blessing.[82] Also, in another ecumenical gesture,\na plaque in Holywell Street, Oxford, now commemorates the Catholic martyrs of\nEngland.

A large number\nof young Dominican [friars](/wiki/Friars \"Friars\") attended. Fr Radcliffe\nsaid, \"I don't think there have been so many Dominicans in one place since the\ntime of Robert Kilwardby, the Dominican Archbishop of Canterbury in the 13th\ncentury.\"[84]\n\nThe Church's principles of social justice influenced initiatives to tackle the\nchallenges of poverty and social inclusion. In Southampton, Fr Pat Murphy\nO'Connor founded the St Dismas Society as an agency to meet the needs of ex-\nprisoners discharged from Winchester prison. Some of St Dismas Society's early\nmembers went on to help found the Simon Community in Sussex then in London.\nTheir example gave new inspiration to other clergy, such as the Revd Kenneth\nLeech (CofE) of [St Anne's Church, Soho](/wiki/St_Anne%27s_Church,_Soho \"St\nAnne's Church, Soho\") who helped found the homeless charity\n[Centrepoint](/wiki/Centrepoint_\\(charity\\) \"Centrepoint \\(charity\\)\"), and\nthe Revd Bruce Kenrick (Church of Scotland) who helped found the homeless\ncharity [Shelter](/wiki/Shelter_\\(charity\\) \"Shelter \\(charity\\)\"). In 1986\nCardinal [Basil Hume](/wiki/Basil_Hume \"Basil Hume\") established the Cardinal\nHume Centre[85] to work with homeless young people, badly housed families and\nlocal communities to access accommodation, support and advice, education,\ntraining and employment opportunities.\n\nIn 2006 Cardinal [Cormac Murphy-O'Connor](/wiki/Cormac_Murphy-O%27Connor\n\"Cormac Murphy-O'Connor\") instituted an annual Mass in Support of Migrant\nWorkers[86] at Westminster Cathedral in partnership with the ethnic chaplains\nof Brentwood, Southwark and Westminster.\n\n##\nOrganisation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Organisation\")]\n\nThe Catholic Church in England and Wales has five\n[provinces](/wiki/Ecclesiastical_province \"Ecclesiastical province\"):\nBirmingham, Cardiff, Liverpool, Southwark and Westminster. There are 22\n[dioceses](/wiki/Diocese \"Diocese\") which are divided into\n[parishes](/wiki/Parish \"Parish\") (for comparison, the Church of England and\nChurch in Wales currently have a total of 50 dioceses). In addition to these,\nthere are four dioceses covering England and Wales for specific groups which\nare the [Bishopric of the Forces](/wiki/Bishopric_of_the_Forces \"Bishopric of\nthe Forces\"), the [Eparchy for\nUkrainians](/wiki/Ukrainian_Catholic_Eparchy_of_Holy_Family_of_London\n\"Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Holy Family of London\"), the [Syro-Malabar\nCatholic Eparchy of Great Britain](/wiki/Syro-\nMalabar_Catholic_Eparchy_of_Great_Britain \"Syro-Malabar Catholic Eparchy of\nGreat Britain\") and the [Personal Ordinariate for former\nAnglicans](/wiki/Personal_Ordinariate_of_Our_Lady_of_Walsingham \"Personal\nOrdinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham\").\n\nThe Catholic bishops in England and Wales come together in a collaborative\nstructure known as the Bishops' Conference. Currently the [Archbishop of\nWestminster](/wiki/Archbishop_of_Westminster \"Archbishop of Westminster\"),\n[Vincent Gerard Nichols](/wiki/Vincent_Gerard_Nichols \"Vincent Gerard\nNichols\"), is the [President](/wiki/President \"President\") of the Bishops'\nConference. For this reason in the global Catholic Church (outside England),\nhe is _de facto_ Primate of England though not in the eyes of English law and\nthe established Church of England. Historically, the avoidance of the title of\n\"Primate\" was to eschew whipping up anti-Catholic tension, in the same way the\nbishops of the restored hierarchy avoided using current titles of Anglican\nsees (Archbishop of Westminster rather than \"Canterbury\" or \"London\").\nHowever, the Archbishop of Westminster had certain privileges: he was the only\nmetropolitan in the country until 1911 (when the archdioceses of Birmingham\nand Liverpool were created) and he has always acted as leader at meetings of\nthe English bishops.\n\nAlthough the bishops of the restored hierarchy took new titles, such as that\nof Westminster, they saw themselves very much in continuity with the pre-\nReformation Church. Westminster in particular saw itself as the continuation\nof Canterbury, hence the similarity of the [coat of arms](/wiki/Coat_of_arms\n\"Coat of arms\") of the two sees (with Westminster believing it has more right\nto it since it features the [pallium](/wiki/Pallium \"Pallium\"), no longer\ngiven to Anglican archbishops). At the back of Westminster Cathedral is a\n[list of Popes](/wiki/List_of_Popes \"List of Popes\") and, alongside this, a\nlist of Catholic Archbishops of Canterbury beginning with [Augustine of\nCanterbury](/wiki/Augustine_of_Canterbury \"Augustine of Canterbury\") and the\nyear they received the pallium. After Cardinal Pole, the last Catholic\nincumbent of Canterbury, the names of the Catholic vicars apostolic or titular\nbishops (from 1685) are recorded and then the Archbishops of Westminster, in\none unimpaired line, from 597 to the present, according to the Archdiocese of\nWestminster.[87][88] To highlight this continuity or unimpaired line today,\nthe installation rites of pre-Reformation Catholic Archbishops of Canterbury\nand earlier Archbishops of Westminster were used at the installation of the\ncurrent Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Gerard\nNichols.[89][90][91] He became the forty-third of [English\ncardinals](/wiki/List_of_English_cardinals \"List of English cardinals\") since\nthe 12th

Lady of\nWalsingham](/wiki/Ordinariate_of_Our_Lady_of_Walsingham \"Ordinariate of Our\nLady of Walsingham\")\n\nIn October 2009, following closed-circuit talks between some Anglicans and the\n[Holy See](/wiki/Holy_See \"Holy See\"), Pope Benedict made a relatively\nunconditional offer to accommodate disaffected Anglicans in the Church of\nEngland, enabling them, for the first time, to retain parts of their liturgy\nand heritage under _[Anglicanorum coetibus](/wiki/Anglicanorum_coetibus\n\"Anglicanorum coetibus\")_ , while being in full communion with Rome. By April\n2012 the ordinariate numbered about 1200, including five bishops and 60\npriests.[92][93] The ordinariate has recruited a group of aristocrats as\nhonorary vice-presidents to help out. These include the Duke of Norfolk, the\nCountess of Oxford and Asquith and the Duchess of Somerset. Other vice-\npresidents include Lord Nicholas Windsor, Sir Josslyn Gore-Booth and the\nSquire de Lisle, whose ancestor [Ambrose de Lisle](/wiki/Ambrose_de_Lisle\n\"Ambrose de Lisle\") was a 19th-century Catholic convert who advocated the\ncorporate reunion of the Anglican Church with Rome. According to the group\nleader, Mgr Keith Newton, the ordinariate will \"work on something with an\nAnglican flavour, but they are not bringing over any set of Anglican\nliturgy.\"[94] The director of music at Westminster Abbey (Anglican), lay\nCatholic James O'Donnell, likens the ordinariate to a Uniate church or one of\nthe many non-Latin Catholic rites, saying: \"This is a good opportunity for us\nto remember that there isn't a one size fits all, and that this could be a\ngood moment to adopt the famous civil service philosophy - 'celebrating\ndiversity'.\"[95] In May 2013, a former Anglican priest, Alan Hopes, was\nappointed the new Bishop of East Anglia, whose diocese includes the Shrine of\nOur Lady of Walsingham.[96]\n\n### Eastern Catholic\nrites[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Eastern Catholic rites\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Wolverhampton_Ukrainian_Catholic_Church.jpg/220px-\nWolverhampton_Ukrainian_Catholic_Church.jpg)](/wiki/File:Wolverhampton_Ukrainian_Catholic_Church.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Wolverhampton_Ukrainian_Catholic_Church.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [Ukrainian Greek Catholic](/wiki/Ukrainian_Greek_Catholic_Church \"Ukrainian\nGreek Catholic Church\") parish church in [Wolverhampton](/wiki/Wolverhampton\n\"Wolverhampton\"), England\n\nThere exists the [Apostolic Exarchate for\nUkrainians](/wiki/Apostolic_Exarchate_for_Ukrainians \"Apostolic Exarchate for\nUkrainians\") which serves the 15,000 Ukrainian Greek Catholics in Great\nBritain, with a cathedral and various churches across the country.\n\nThe Lebanese Maronite Order (LMO) runs in England and Wales.

\nPolish-speaking Catholics first arrived in England in some numbers after the\n[partitions of Poland](/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland \"Partitions of Poland\")\nduring the 19th century. One of the most notable Poles at this time, who\neventually settled in England, was [Joseph Conrad](/wiki/Joseph_Conrad \"Joseph\nConrad\"). At the end of the Second World War, many Polish servicemen were\nunable to return to their homeland following the imposition of a communist\nregime hostile to their return, and the [Polish Resettlement\nCorps](/wiki/Polish_Resettlement_Corps \"Polish Resettlement Corps\") was formed\nby the British government to ease their transition into British life. They\nwere joined by several thousand Displaced Persons (DPs), many were their\nfamily members. This influx of Poles gave rise to the 1947 Polish Resettlement\nAct which allowed approximately 250,000 Polish Servicemen and their\ndependents, to settle in Britain. [Many assimilated](/wiki/Polish_British\n\"Polish British\") into existing Catholic congregations. According to the\nPolish Catholic Mission in England and Wales[97] in 1948 the Catholic\nhierarchy in England Wales agreed the appointment of a vicar delegate,\nnominated by the Polish Episcopate, with ordinary power over the Polish clergy\nand laity throughout England and Wales with certain exceptions relating to\nmarriage. Subsequently, whenever a Polish Catholic community emerges within\nEngland and Wales, the vicar delegate appoints a Polish priest to organise a\nlocal branch of the Polish Catholic Mission. A priest thus appointed is the\npriest in charge, not a parish priest. There are no Polish parishes or\nquasiparishes in England and Wales (in accordance with Canons 515 §1 and 516\n§1) with the exception of the church at Devonia Road in London. A Polish\nCommunity is sometimes referred to as a \"parish\" but is not a parish in the\ncanonical sense. Hence the Community is not a juridical person. The canonical\njuridical personality which represents the interests of all Polish Communities\nis vested in the Polish Catholic Mission.[98]\n\nSince the 2004 [accession of Poland to the European\nUnion](/wiki/Accession_of_Poland_to_the_European_Union \"Accession of Poland to\nthe European Union\") there has been further large-scale Polish [immigration to\nthe\nUK](/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom_\\(1922-present_day\\)#European_Union\n\"Immigration to the United Kingdom \\(1922-present day\\)\"). Currently the\nPolish Catholic Mission includes around 219 parishes and pastoral centres with\n114 priests.[99] The current rector of the Polish Catholic Mission is Rev.\nStefan Wylężek. In Poland, the Polish Bishops Conference has a delegate with\nspecial responsibility for émigré Poles. The current postholder is Bishop\nRyszard Karpiński. [The Tablet](/wiki/The_Tablet \"The Tablet\") reported in\nDecember 2007 that the Polish Catholic Mission says these parishes follow a\npastoral programme set by the Polish conference of bishops and are viewed as\n\"an integral part of the Polish church\".[100]\n\nIn December 2007 Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor said \"I'm quite concerned\nthat Poles are creating a separate Church in Britain – I would want them to be\npart of the Catholic life of this country. I would hope those responsible for\nthe Polish Church here, and the Poles themselves, will be aware that they\nshould become a part of local parishes as soon as possible when they learn\nenough of the language.\" Mgr Kukla stressed that the Polish Catholic Mission\ncontinues to have a \"good relationship\" with the hierarchy in England and\nWales and said \"Integration is a long process.\"[101]\n\nSignificantly, the Polish Mission co-operated fully with the English\nhierarchy's recent research enquiry into the needs of migrants in London's\ncatholic community. \"The Ground of Justice\"[102] report by Francis Davis[103]\nand Jolanta Stanke _et al._ Von Hügel Institute[104] at [St Edmund's College,\nCambridge](/wiki/St_Edmund%27s_College,_Cambridge \"St Edmund's College,\nCambridge\") was commissioned by [Archbishop Kevin\nMcDonald](/wiki/Archbishop_Kevin_McDonald \"Archbishop Kevin McDonald\") of\nSouthwark, and [Bishop Thomas McMahon](/wiki/Thomas_McMahon_\\(bishop\\) \"Thomas\nMcMahon \\(bishop\\)\") of Brentwood. 1000 people attending Mass in three London\ndioceses were surveyed using anonymous questionnaires available in Polish,\nLithuanian, Chinese, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English. The\ncongregations were from mainstream Diocesan parishes, ethnic chaplaincies, and\nchurches of the Polish Vicariate. The report findings described how 86% of\neastern Europeans said the availability of Mass in their mother tongue was a\nreason for their choosing to worship in a particular church. The report's\nrecommendations emphasised cooperation with key overseas bishops conferences,\ndioceses, and [religious institutes](/wiki/Religious_institute \"Religious\ninstitute\") on the recruitment and appointment of ethnic chaplains; the\nrecognition of language skills as a legitimate training activity and cost for\nseminarians, clergy, parish volunteer and lay employees; and the consolidation\nof dispersed charitable funds for pastoral development and the poor in\nLondon.[105]\n\n## Adoption\ncontroversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Adoption controversy\")]\n\nOn November 3, 2016, John Bingham reported in The Daily Telegraph that\nCardinal [Vincent Nichols](/wiki/Vincent_Nichols \"Vincent Nichols\") officially\nacknowledged that the Catholic Church in England and Wales had pressured\nyoung, unmarried

The name 'Ecclesia Anglicana,' or English Church, was of course employed, but always in the Catholic and Papal use of the term as signifying that part of the one Catholic Church under the jurisdiction of the Pope which was situated in England, and precisely in the same way as the Church in Scotland was called the 'Ecclesia Scotticana,' the Church in France, the 'Ecclesia Gallicana,' and the Church in Spain the 'Ecclesia Hispanica.' That such national or regional appellations were a part of the style of the Roman Curia itself, and that they in no sense could have implied any indication of independence from Rome, is sufficiently well known to all who are familiar with pre-Reformation records.\"\n  3. **Jump up ^** [Martin Marty](/wiki/Martin_Marty \"Martin Marty\"), \"Protestantism\", _The Encyclopedia of Religion_ (New York: Macmillan Publishing, 1987) Vol. 12, 26.

In short, the Waldensians, the Czech groups, and the Anglicans alike were, and were seen to be, part of the Protestant revolt from both the viewpoints of Catholic leadership and historical scholarship ever since.\n  4. **Jump up ^** T.

Phillips says this: \"Religious historians beg off from stating firm numbers for either camp. If Puritans probably represented 10–20 percent of the national population, most of them still worshiping within the Church of England, Catholics were much harder to count. Open 'recusants' – Catholics who paid fines to avoid attending the Church of England – numbered sixty thousand in 1640. Many more, however, reluctantly attended services on Sunday with scowls or for as short a time as possible. The more identifiable of these were called 'Church Papists'; the less important, ordinary grumblers who merely talked of preferring the older ceremonies were uncountable. In the north and west, at least half the population outside the towns were Catholic to some degree. By this broad definition, Catholics would have numbered 10–15 percent of the total English population. Practicing Catholics, however, could not have been more than 2–3 percent. Catholicism survived most strongly among the nobility, of whom 15–20 percent clung to the old faith, including many leading magnates in an arc from Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire south to Derby, Worchestershire, and Hereforshire. However, even solidly Protestant East Anglian counties like Suffolk and Essex each had three, four, or a half-dozen aristocratic families holding to the religion of their forebears. This is perhaps one reason why the populace took Catholic 'plots' so seriously: What they called popery was especially visible among the powerful and influential.\"\n  40. **Jump up ^** Also see: John Morrill's _The Nature of the English Revolution_ (1993); Conrad Russell's _The Causes of the English Civil War_ (1990); and Barry Coward's _The Stuart Age_ 1994).\n  41. **Jump up ^** Mieczysław Biskupski, [_The History of Poland_](https://books.google.com/books?id=QDgaX6q9tycC&pg=PA14&dq=poland+religious+toleration&hl=en&ei=zvnRTMn9O5KW4Abz7tmTDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=poland%20religious%20toleration&f=false), Greenwood 2000, p 14.\n  42. **Jump up ^** Ole Peter Grell, [Tolerance and Intolerance in the European Reformation](https://books.google.com/books?id=J6gFzp6coTYC&pg=PA65&dq=france+religious+toleration&hl=en&ei=VfzRTMmdIeqT4gaSjrHCDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=france%20religious%20toleration&f=false), Cambridge University Press 2002, p 65.\n  43. **Jump up ^** Ackroyd, 185.\n  44. **Jump up ^** Works of John Dryden at [Project Gutenberg](/wiki/Project_Gutenberg \"Project Gutenberg\")\n  45. **Jump up ^** Alan Taylor, _American Colonies_ (New York: Viking, 2001), 278.\n  46. **Jump up ^** The historian Diarmaid MacCulloch says this: \"His [James II] replacement on the throne in 1688 by his Dutch son-in-law Willem of Orange was virtually bloodless because the whole English establishment [including the Church of England's [Seven Bishops](/wiki/Seven_Bishops \"Seven Bishops\") ] stood by and let it happen, earning the event the name of the Glorious Revolution.
