Outside of online fiction, the Slender Man has\nbecome an internet icon and has influenced popular culture, having been\nreferenced in the video game _[Minecraft](/wiki/Minecraft \"Minecraft\")_ with\nthe [Enderman](/wiki/Enderman \"Enderman\") character and generated video games\nof his own, such as _[Slender: The Eight Pages](/wiki/Slender:_The_Eight_Pages\n\"Slender: The Eight Pages\")_ and _[Slender: The\nArrival](/wiki/Slender:_The_Arrival \"Slender: The Arrival\")_.

P. Lovecraft](/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft \"H. P. Lovecraft\")\ninfluenced the creation of the Slender Man.\n\nThe Slender Man was created on June 10, 2009, on a thread in the [Something\nAwful](/wiki/Something_Awful \"Something Awful\") [Internet\nforum](/wiki/Internet_forum \"Internet forum\").[5][6] The thread was a\n[Photoshop contest](/wiki/Photoshop_contest \"Photoshop contest\") in which\nusers were challenged to \"create paranormal images.\"[7][8] Forum poster Eric\nKnudsen, under the pseudonym \"Victor Surge\",[9] contributed two [black-and-\nwhite](/wiki/Black_and_white_photography \"Black and white photography\") images\nof groups of children to which he added a tall, thin, spectral figure wearing\na black suit.[10][11] Although previous entries had consisted solely of\nphotographs, Surge supplemented his submission with snatches of\ntext—supposedly from witnesses—describing the abductions of the groups of\nchildren and giving the character the name \"The Slender Man\":\n\nThe quote under the first photograph read:\n\n> We didn't want to go, we didn't want to kill them, but its persistent\n> silence and outstretched arms horrified and comforted us at the same time…\n>\n> — 1983, photographer unknown, presumed dead.[11]\n\nThe quote under the second photograph read:\n\n> One of two recovered photographs from the [Stirling\n> City](/wiki/Stirling_City,_California \"Stirling City, California\") Library\n> blaze.

Actual\n> photograph confiscated as evidence.\n>\n> — 1986, photographer: Mary Thomas, missing since June 13th, 1986.[11]\n\nThese additions effectively transformed the photographs into a work of\nfiction. Subsequent posters expanded upon the character, adding their own\nvisual or textual contributions.[10][11]\n\nKnudsen was inspired to create the Slender Man primarily by [Zack\nParsons](/wiki/Something_Awful \"Something Awful\")' \"That Insidious Beast\",\n[Stephen King](/wiki/Stephen_King \"Stephen King\")'s _[The Mist](/wiki/The_Mist\n\"The Mist\")_ , reports of [shadow people](/wiki/Shadow_person \"Shadow\nperson\"), [Mothman](/wiki/Mothman \"Mothman\") and the [Mad Gasser of\nMattoon](/wiki/Mad_Gasser_of_Mattoon \"Mad Gasser of Mattoon\").[12] Other\ninspirations for the character were [the Tall Man](/wiki/Tall_Man_\\(Phantasm\\)\n\"Tall Man \\(Phantasm\\)\") from the 1979 film\n_[Phantasm](/wiki/Phantasm_\\(film\\) \"Phantasm \\(film\\)\")_ ,[13] [H. P.\nLovecraft](/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft \"H. P. Lovecraft\"), the surrealist work of\n[William S. Burroughs](/wiki/William_S._Burroughs \"William S.

Like\nfairies, Slender Man is otherworldly, with motives that are often difficult to\ngrasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what\nthe viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, the Slender Man calls the\nwoods and wild places his home and [kidnaps children](/wiki/Changeling\n\"Changeling\").[13][_[page needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]\n\n### Development\n\nThe Slender Man soon went [viral](/wiki/Viral_phenomenon \"Viral\nphenomenon\"),[16] spawning numerous works of [fanart](/wiki/Fanart \"Fanart\"),\n[cosplay](/wiki/Cosplay \"Cosplay\"), and online fiction known as\n\"[creepypasta](/wiki/Creepypasta \"Creepypasta\")\"—scary stories told in short\nsnatches of easily copyable text that spread from site to site. Divorced from\nits original creator, the Slender Man became the subject of myriad stories by\nmultiple authors within an overarching mythos.[3]\n\nMany aspects of the Slender Man mythos first appeared on the original\nSomething Awful thread. One of the earliest additions was added by a forum\nuser named \"Thoreau-Up\", who created a folklore story set in 16th-century\nGermany involving a character called Der Groẞman, which was implied to be an\nearly reference to the Slender Man.[13]:36 The first video series involving\nthe Slender Man evolved from a post on the Something Awful thread by user \"ce\ngars\". It tells of a fictional [film school](/wiki/Film_school \"Film school\")\nfriend named Alex Kralie, who had stumbled upon something troubling while\nshooting his first feature-length project, _[Marble\nHornets](/wiki/Marble_Hornets \"Marble Hornets\")_. The video series, published\nin [found footage](/wiki/Found_footage_\\(pseudo-documentary\\) \"Found footage\n\\(pseudo-documentary\\)\") style on [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\"), forms an\n[alternate reality game](/wiki/Alternate_reality_game \"Alternate reality\ngame\") describing the filmers' fictional experiences with the Slender Man. The\nARG also incorporates a [Twitter](/wiki/Twitter \"Twitter\") feed and an\nalternate YouTube channel created by a user named \"totheark\".[2][17] As of\n2013, _Marble Hornets_ had over 250,000 subscribers around the world and had\nreceived 55 million views.[18] Other Slender Man-themed YouTube serials\nfollowed, including _EverymanHYBRID_ and _TribeTwelve_.[2]\n\nIn 2012, the Slender Man was adapted into a video game titled _[Slender: The\nEight Pages](/wiki/Slender:_The_Eight_Pages \"Slender: The Eight Pages\")_ ;\nwithin its first month of release, the game was downloaded over 2 million\ntimes.[19] Several popular variants of the game followed, including\n_Slenderman 's Shadow_[20] and _Slender Man_ for [iOS](/wiki/IOS \"IOS\"), which\nbecame the second most-popular app download.[21] The sequel to _Slender: The\nEight Pages_ , _[Slender: The Arrival](/wiki/Slender:_The_Arrival \"Slender:\nThe Arrival\")_ , was released in 2013.[22] Several [independent\nfilms](/wiki/Independent_film \"Independent film\") about the Slender Man have\nbeen released or are in development, including _Entity_[23] and _The Slender\nMan_ , released free online after a $10,000 [Kickstarter](/wiki/Kickstarter\n\"Kickstarter\") campaign.[24] In 2013, it was announced that _Marble Hornets_\nwould become a feature film.[18] In 2015, the film adaptation, _[Always\nWatching: A Marble Hornets\nStory](/wiki/Always_Watching:_A_Marble_Hornets_Story \"Always Watching: A\nMarble Hornets Story\")_ , was released on [VOD](/wiki/Video_on_demand \"Video\non demand\"), where the character was portrayed by [Doug\nJones](/wiki/Doug_Jones_\\(actor\\) \"Doug Jones \\(actor\\)\").[25] In 2016, [Sony\nPictures](/wiki/Sony_Pictures \"Sony Pictures\") subsidiary [Screen\nGems](/wiki/Screen_Gems \"Screen Gems\") partnered with Mythology Entertainment\nto bring a [Slender Man film](/wiki/Slender_Man_\\(film\\) \"Slender Man\n\\(film\\)\") into theatres, with the title character portrayed by [Javier\nBotet](/wiki/Javier_Botet \"Javier Botet\").[26]\n\n## Description\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Symbol_Proxy.png/220px-\nSymbol_Proxy.png)](/wiki/File:Symbol_Proxy.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Symbol_Proxy.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe \"Slender Man symbol\" introduced by _Marble Hornets_\n\nBecause the Slender Man's fictional \"mythology\" has evolved without an\nofficial \"canon\" for reference, his appearance, motives, habits, and abilities\nare not fixed but change depending on the storyteller.[27] He is most commonly\ndescribed as very tall and thin with unnaturally long,\n[tentacle](/wiki/Tentacle \"Tentacle\")-like arms (or merely tentacles),[3]\nwhich he can extend to intimidate or capture prey. In most stories his face is\nwhite and featureless, but occasionally his face appears differently to anyone\nwho sees it.[27] He appears to be wearing a dark suit and tie. The Slender Man\nis often associated with the forest and/or abandoned locations and has the\nability to [teleport](/wiki/Teleportation \"Teleportation\").[28][29] Proximity\nto the Slender Man is often said to trigger a \"Slender sickness\"; a rapid\nonset of [paranoia](/wiki/Paranoia \"Paranoia\"), nightmares and delusions\naccompanied by [nosebleeds](/wiki/Nosebleed \"Nosebleed\").[30]\n\nEarly stories featured him targeting children or young adults. Some featured\nyoung adults driven insane or to act on his behalf, while others did not, and\nothers claim that investigating the Slender Man will draw his\nattention.[13][_[page needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\")_] The web series _Marble Hornets_ established the idea of proxies\n(humans who fall under the Slender Man's influence) though initially they were\nsimply violently insane, rather than puppets of the Slender Man. _Marble\nHornets_ also introduced the idea that the Slender Man could interfere with\nvideo and audio recordings, as well as the \"Slender Man symbol\", which became\na common trope of Slender fiction.[13][_[page\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] [Graphic\nviolence](/wiki/Graphic_violence \"Graphic violence\") and [body\nhorror](/wiki/List_of_body_horror_media \"List of body horror media\") are\nuncommon in the Slender Man mythos, with many narratives choosing to leave the\nfate of his victims obscure.[13][_[page needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] Shira Chess notes that \"It is important to note\nthat few of the retellings identify exactly what kind of monster the Slender\nMan might be, and what his specific intentions are- these points all remain\nmysteriously and usefully vague.\"[27]\n\n### As folklore\n\nSeveral scholars have argued that, despite being a fictional work with an\nidentifiable origin point, the Slender Man represents a form of digital\nfolklore. Shira Chess argues that the Slender Man exemplifies the similarities\nbetween traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and\nthat, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves,\nthe fact that the Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a\npowerful insight into how myth and folklore form.[10] Chess identifies three\naspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity\n(meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual),\nvariability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and\nperformance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the\nresponses of his/her audience).[13][_[page\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]\n\nAndrew Peck also considers the Slender Man to be an authentic form of folklore\nand notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck\nsuggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-\nface performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously,\nencouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect\nreplication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication,\nand generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity\ndespite the lack of a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender\nMan represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions\nand emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative\npotential of networked communication.[31]\n\nJeff Tolbert also accepts the Slender Man as folkloric and suggests it\nrepresents a process he calls “reverse ostension.” [Ostension](/wiki/Ostension\n\"Ostension\") in folkloristics is the process of acting out a folk narrative.\nAccording to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of\nfolklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure\nproduced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an\nexisting and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents\ntwo processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new\ndisconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these\nelements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore\n(but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).[32]\n\nProfessor Thomas Pettitt of the [University of Southern\nDenmark](/wiki/University_of_Southern_Denmark \"University of Southern\nDenmark\") has described the Slender Man as being an exemplar of the modern\nage's closing of the \"[Gutenberg Parenthesis](/wiki/Secondary_orality\n\"Secondary orality\")\"; the time period from the invention of the printing\npress to the spread of the web in which stories and information were codified\nin discrete media, to a return to the older, more primal forms of\nstorytelling, exemplified by [oral tradition](/wiki/Oral_tradition \"Oral\ntradition\") and [campfire](/wiki/Campfire \"Campfire\") tales, in which the same\nstory can be retold, reinterpreted and recast by different tellers, expanding\nand evolving with time.[28]\n\n## Reasons for success\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Slendermdl70.jpg/220px-\nSlendermdl70.jpg)](/wiki/File:Slendermdl70.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Slendermdl70.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAnonymous graffito of the Slender Man drawn on pavement in [Raleigh, North\nCarolina](/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina \"Raleigh, North Carolina\")\n\nMedia scholar and folklorist Andrew Peck attributes the success of the Slender\nMan to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives\nare shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes\nand imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the\nideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the\ncollaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of\nprivileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative\nculture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In\nthese respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban\nlegends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social\ninteraction and personal acts of creative expression.[31]\n\nAlthough nearly all users understand that the Slender Man is not real, they\nsuspend that disbelief in order to become more engrossed when telling or\nlistening to stories.[32] This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man\nlegend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality, keeping\nthe creature as an object of legend [dialectic](/wiki/Dialectic\n\"Dialectic\").[33] This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the\ncharacter's origin and purpose. Only five months after his creation, [George\nNoory](/wiki/George_Noory \"George Noory\")'s _[Coast to Coast\nAM](/wiki/Coast_to_Coast_AM \"Coast to Coast AM\")_ , a radio [call-in\nshow](/wiki/Call-in_show \"Call-in show\") devoted to the paranormal and\nconspiracy theories, began receiving callers asking about the Slender Man.[34]\nTwo years later, an article in the _[Minneapolis Star\nTribune](/wiki/Minneapolis_Star_Tribune \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\")_ described\nhis origins as \"difficult to pinpoint.\"[27] Eric Knudsen has commented that\nmany people, despite understanding that the Slender Man was created on the\nSomething Awful forums, still entertain the possibility that he might be\nreal.[28]\n\nShira Chess describes the Slender Man as a metaphor for \"helplessness, power\ndifferentials, and anonymous forces.\"[27] Peck sees parallels between the\nSlender Man and common anxieties about the digital age, such as feelings of\nconstant connectedness and unknown third-party observation.[31] Similarly, Tye\nVan Horn, a writer for _The Elm_ , has suggested that the Slender Man\nrepresents modern [fear](/wiki/Fear \"Fear\") of the unknown; in an age [flooded\nwith information](/wiki/Information_overload \"Information overload\"), people\nhave become so unaccustomed to [ignorance](/wiki/Ignorance \"Ignorance\") that\nthey now fear what they cannot understand.[35] Troy Wagner, the creator of\n_Marble Hornets_ , ascribes the terror of the Slender Man to its malleability;\npeople can shape it into whatever frightens them most.[28] Tina Marie Boyer\nnoted that \"The Slender man is a prohibitive monster, but the cultural\nboundaries he guards are not clear. Victims do not know when they have\nviolated or crossed them.\"[13][_[page needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]\n\n## Copyright\n\nDespite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man is not in the [public\ndomain](/wiki/Public_domain \"Public domain\"). Several for-profit ventures\ninvolving the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the\ncreator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from\ndistribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints\nfrom Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal\nblessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated\nby the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the\noptions to any adaptations into other media, including film and television.\nThe identity of this option holder has not been made public.[9] Knudsen\nhimself has argued that his enforcement of [copyright](/wiki/Copyright\n\"Copyright\") has less to do with money than with artistic integrity: \"I just\nwant something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing\nand kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda\nconventional.\"[34] As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been\nsold to production company [Mythology\nEntertainment](/w/index.php?title=Mythology_Entertainment&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Mythology Entertainment \\(page does not exist\\)\").[26]\n\n## Related incidents\n\n### Waukesha stabbing\n\nMain article: [Slender Man stabbing](/wiki/Slender_Man_stabbing \"Slender Man\nstabbing\")\n\nOn May 31, 2014, two 12-year-old girls in\n[Waukesha](/wiki/Waukesha_County,_Wisconsin \"Waukesha County, Wisconsin\"),\n[Wisconsin](/wiki/Wisconsin \"Wisconsin\") allegedly held down and stabbed a\n12-year-old classmate 19 times. When questioned later by authorities, they\nreportedly claimed that they wished to commit a murder as a first step to\nbecoming proxies for the Slender Man, having read about it online.[36] They\nalso state that they were afraid that Slender Man would kill their families if\nthey did not commit the murder.[37] The victim was able to crawl from the\nwoods, where she had been left, to reach a roadside. A passing cyclist\nintervened, and the victim survived the attack. Both attackers have been\ndiagnosed with mental illnesses[38] but have also been charged as adults and\nare each facing up to 65 years in prison.[39] One of the girls reportedly said\nSlender Man watches her, can read minds, and could teleport.[36]\n\nExperts testified in court she also said she conversed with [Lord\nVoldemort](/wiki/Lord_Voldemort \"Lord Voldemort\") and one of the [Teenage\nMutant Ninja Turtles](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles \"Teenage Mutant Ninja\nTurtles\"). On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her\nprosecution was suspended until her condition improved.[40] On November 12,\n2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand\ntrial,[41] and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were\ncompetent to stand trial.[42] In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that\nthe girls would be tried as adults.[43] They were tried separately.[44] On\nAugust 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to\nattempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her\nactions on grounds of insanity.[45] Although prosecutors alleged that she knew\nwhat she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill\nduring the attack.
