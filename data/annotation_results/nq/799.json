Originally called _Semaine Internationale des Sports d 'Hiver_\n(\"International Winter Sports Week\") and held in association with the [1924\nSummer Olympics](/wiki/1924_Summer_Olympics \"1924 Summer Olympics\"), the\nsports competitions were held at the foot of [Mont Blanc](/wiki/Mont_Blanc\n\"Mont Blanc\") in [Chamonix](/wiki/Chamonix \"Chamonix\"), and [Haute-\nSavoie](/wiki/Haute-Savoie \"Haute-Savoie\"), France between January 25 and\nFebruary 5, 1924.[1] The Games were organized by the French Olympic Committee,\nand were in retrospect designated by the [International Olympic\nCommittee](/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee \"International Olympic\nCommittee\") (IOC) as the I Olympic Winter Games.\n\nThe tradition of holding the Winter Olympics in the same year as the Summer\nOlympics would continue until [1992](/wiki/1992_Winter_Olympics \"1992 Winter\nOlympics\"), after which the current practice of holding a Winter Olympics in\nthe second year after each Summer Olympics began.\n\nAlthough Figure Skating had been an Olympic event in both\n[London](/wiki/1908_Summer_Olympics \"1908 Summer Olympics\") and\n[Antwerp](/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics \"1920 Summer Olympics\"), and Ice Hockey\nhad been an event in Antwerp, the winter sports had always been limited by the\nseason. In 1921, at the convention of the IOC in [Lausanne](/wiki/Lausanne\n\"Lausanne\"), there was a call for equality for winter sports, and after much\ndiscussion it was decided to organize an \"international week of winter sport\"\nin 1924 in Chamonix.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Highlights\n    * 1.1 Day 2\n    * 1.2 Day 4\n    * 1.3 Day 6\n    * 1.4 Day 8\n    * 1.5 Day 10\n    * 1.6 Epilogue\n  * 2 Events\n  * 3 Venues\n  * 4 Participating nations\n    * 4.1 Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees\n  * 5 Medal count\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 Notes\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n##\nHighlights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=1924_Winter_Olympics&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Highlights\")]\n\n### Day 2[[edit](/w/index.php?title=1924_Winter_Olympics&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Day 2\")]\n\nThe first gold medal awarded in the Olympic Winter games was won by [Charles\nJewtraw](/wiki/Charles_Jewtraw \"Charles Jewtraw\") of the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") in the 500-meter speed skate.\n\n### Day 4[[edit](/w/index.php?title=1924_Winter_Olympics&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Day 4\")]\n\n[Sonja Henie](/wiki/Sonja_Henie \"Sonja Henie\"), at just eleven years old,\nskates in the ladies' figure skating competition.

Canada would dominate ice hockey in early Olympic\ncompetition, winning six of the first seven gold medals awarded.\n\n###\nEpilogue[[edit](/w/index.php?title=1924_Winter_Olympics&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Epilogue\")]\n\nAt the closing of the games a prize was awarded for a sport that did not lend\nitself very well for tournaments: [Pierre de\nCoubertin](/wiki/Pierre_de_Coubertin \"Pierre de Coubertin\") presented a prize\nfor 'alpinisme' ([mountaineering](/wiki/Mountaineering \"Mountaineering\")) to\n[Charles Granville Bruce](/wiki/Charles_Granville_Bruce \"Charles Granville\nBruce\"), the leader of the expedition that tried to climb [Mount\nEverest](/wiki/Mount_Everest \"Mount Everest\") in 1922.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the modern Olympics, the host country, in\nthis case, France, failed to win any [gold medals](/wiki/Gold_medals \"Gold\nmedals\"), finishing with three bronze medals. This feat would later occur at\nthe [next Winter Olympics](/wiki/1928_Winter_Olympics \"1928 Winter Olympics\")\nin [St. Moritz](/wiki/St._Moritz \"St. Moritz\") where Switzerland won only a\nsingle bronze medal, the lowest ever output by a host nation at an Olympics.\nLater host nations to finish without gold medals included Canada at the [1976\nSummer Olympics](/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics \"1976 Summer Olympics\") in\n[Montreal](/wiki/Montreal \"Montreal\") and [1988 Winter\nOlympics](/wiki/1988_Winter_Olympics \"1988 Winter Olympics\") in\n[Calgary](/wiki/Calgary \"Calgary\") and [Yugoslavia](/wiki/Yugoslavia\n\"Yugoslavia\") at the [1984 Winter Olympics](/wiki/1984_Winter_Olympics \"1984\nWinter Olympics\") in [Sarajevo](/wiki/Sarajevo \"Sarajevo\").\n\nIn 1925, the IOC decided to organize Olympic Winter Games every four years,\nindependent of the Olympic Games proper, and recognized the International\nWinter Sports Week as the first Olympic Winter games in retrospect.\n\nIn 1974 the final individual medal of Chamonix 1924 was presented. [Anders\nHaugen](/wiki/Anders_Haugen \"Anders Haugen\"), who until then had been recorded\nas finishing fourth in the [ski jumping\nevent](/wiki/Ski_jumping_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Ski jumping at the 1924\nWinter Olympics\"), received a bronze medal. After fifty years an error had\nbeen discovered in the score of [Thorleif Haug](/wiki/Thorleif_Haug \"Thorleif\nHaug\").\n\nIn 2006, the IOC confirmed that the awarded medals to 1924\n[curling](/wiki/Curling \"Curling\") teams were official. The IOC verified that\ncurling was officially part of the program, after the _[Glasgow\nHerald](/wiki/Glasgow_Herald \"Glasgow Herald\")_ newspaper filed a claim on\nbehalf of the families of the team.[2]\n\n## Events[[edit](/w/index.php?title=1924_Winter_Olympics&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Events\")]\n\nMedals were awarded in 16 events contested in 5 sports (9 disciplines). Many\nsources do not list curling and the military patrol, or list them as\ndemonstration events. However, no such designation was made in 1924. In\nFebruary 2006 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ruled that curling was\na full part of the Olympic program, and have included the medals awarded in\nthe official count.\n\n  *
