The movement later turned\ninto a political movement seeking to drive out the British from\n[Manipur](/wiki/Manipur \"Manipur\") and the surrounding\n[Naga](/wiki/Naga_people \"Naga people\") areas. Within the Heraka faith, she\ncame to be considered an incarnation of the Goddess Cherachamdinliu.[2]\nGaidinliu was arrested in 1932 at the age of 16, and was sentenced to life\nimprisonment by the British rulers. [Jawaharlal Nehru](/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru\n\"Jawaharlal Nehru\") met her at Shillong Jail in 1937, and promised to pursue\nher release. Nehru gave her the title of \"Rani\" (\"Queen\"), and she gained\nlocal popularity as **Rani Gaidinliu**.\n\nShe was released in 1947 after [India's independence](/wiki/Partition_of_India\n\"Partition of India\"), and continued to work for the upliftment of her people.\nAn advocate of the ancestral Naga religious practices, she staunchly resisted\nthe conversion of Nagas to Christianity. She was honoured as a freedom fighter\nand was awarded a [Padma Bhushan](/wiki/Padma_Bhushan \"Padma Bhushan\") by the\nGovernment of India.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Early life\n  * 2 As Haipou Jadonang's disciple\n  * 3 Rebellion and incarceration\n  * 4 Life in independent India\n  * 5 Death\n  * 6 Legacy\n  * 7 References\n\n## Early life[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rani_Gaidinliu&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Early life\")]\n\nGaidinliu was born on 26 January 1915 at Nungkao (or Longkao) village in the\npresent-day Tousem sub-division of [Tamenglong\nDistrict](/wiki/Tamenglong_District \"Tamenglong District\"), Manipur. She was\nfrom the [Rongmei](/wiki/Rongmei \"Rongmei\") tribe (also known as Kabui). She\nwas the fifth of eight children, including six sisters and a younger brother,\nborn to Lothonang Pamei and Kachaklenliu.[3] The family belonged to the ruling\nclan of the village.[4] She did not have a formal education due to the lack of\nschools in the area.[5]\n\n## As Haipou Jadonang's\ndisciple[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rani_Gaidinliu&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: As Haipou Jadonang's disciple\")]\n\nIn 1927, when she was just 13, Gaidinliu joined the _[Heraka](/wiki/Heraka\n\"Heraka\")_ movement of her cousin [Haipou Jadonang](/wiki/Haipou_Jadonang\n\"Haipou Jadonang\"), who had emerged as a prominent local leader. Jadonang's\nmovement was a revival of the Naga tribal religion. It also aimed to end the\nBritish rule and establish the self-rule of the Nagas (_Naga Raj_). It\nattracted a number of followers from the Zeliangrong tribes (the\n[Zeme](/wiki/Zeme_Naga \"Zeme Naga\"), [Liangmai](/wiki/Liangmei_Naga \"Liangmei\nNaga\") and [Rongmei](/wiki/Rongmei_Naga \"Rongmei Naga\")). With the arrival of\nguns from [Cachar](/wiki/Cachar \"Cachar\"), it turned into an armed rebellion\nagainst the British policies of forced labour and ruthless oppression.\n\nPersuaded by Jadonang's ideology and principles, Gaidinliu became his disciple\nand a part of his movement against the British. In three years, by the age of\n16, she became a leader of [guerrilla](/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare \"Guerrilla\nwarfare\") forces fighting against the British rulers.\n\n## Rebellion and\nincarceration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rani_Gaidinliu&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Rebellion and incarceration\")]\n\nAfter Jadonang was arrested and hanged by the British in 1931, Gaidinliu\nemerged as his spiritual and political heir.[6]\n\nShe openly rebelled against the British rule, exhorting the Zeliangrong people\nnot to pay taxes. She received donations from the local Nagas, many of whom\nalso joined her as volunteers. The British authorities launched a manhunt for\nher. She evaded arrest by the police, moving across villages in what are now\nAssam, Nagaland and Manipur. The Governor of [Assam](/wiki/Colonial_Assam\n\"Colonial Assam\") dispatched the 3rd and 4th battalions of the [Assam\nRifles](/wiki/Assam_Rifles \"Assam Rifles\") against her, under the supervision\nof the [Naga Hills](/wiki/Naga_Hills_District,_British_India \"Naga Hills\nDistrict, British India\") Deputy Commissioner JP Mills. Monetary rewards were\ndeclared for information leading to her arrest: this included a declaration\nthat any village providing information on her whereabouts will get a 10-year\ntax break. Her forces engaged the Assam Rifles in armed conflicts in the North\nCachar Hills (16 February 1932) and the Hangrum village (18 March 1932).\n\nIn October 1932, Gaidinliu moved to the Pulomi village, where her followers\nstarted building a wooden fortress. While the fortress was under construction,\nan Assam Rifles contingent headed by Captain MacDonald launched a surprise\nattack on the village on 17 October 1932. Gaidinliu, along with her followers,\nwas arrested without any resistance near the Kenoma village. Gaidinliu denied\nthat she had any role in the attack on the Hangrum post of the Assam Rifles or\nthe construction of the fort.[2] In December 1932, her followers from the Leng\nand the Bopungwemi villages murdered the [Kuki](/wiki/Kuki_people \"Kuki\npeople\") [chowkidar](/wiki/Chowkidar \"Chowkidar\") (watchman) of the Lakema\nInspection Bungalow in the Naga Hills, suspecting him to be the informer who\nled to her arrest. Gaidinliu was taken to [Imphal](/wiki/Imphal \"Imphal\"),\nwhere she was convicted on the charges of murder and abetment of murder after\na 10-month trial. She was sentenced to [life\nimprisonment](/wiki/Life_imprisonment \"Life imprisonment\") by the Political\nAgent's Court for abetment of murder.[7] Most of her associates were either\nexecuted or jailed.[5]\n\nFrom 1933 to 1947 she served time at the [Guwahati](/wiki/Guwahati\n\"Guwahati\"), [Shillong](/wiki/Shillong \"Shillong\"), [Aizawl](/wiki/Aizawl\n\"Aizawl\") and [Tura](/wiki/Tura,_Meghalaya \"Tura, Meghalaya\") jails. Many\nrebels proclaimed her and Jadonang to be their inspiration in refusing to pay\ntaxes to the British. However, her movement declined after the last of her\nfollowers, Dikeo and Ramjo, were arrested in 1933. [Jawaharlal\nNehru](/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru \"Jawaharlal Nehru\") met her at the Shillong Jail\nin 1937 and he promised to pursue her release. His statement, published in the\n[Hindustan Times](/wiki/Hindustan_Times \"Hindustan Times\"), described\nGaidinliu as a daughter of the hills and he gave her the title 'Rani' or Queen\nof her people. Nehru wrote to the British [MP](/wiki/Member_of_Parliament\n\"Member of Parliament\") [Lady Astor](/wiki/Nancy_Astor,_Viscountess_Astor\n\"Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor\") to do something for the release of Rani\nGaidinliu but the [Secretary of State for\nIndia](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_India \"Secretary of State for India\")\nrejected her request stating that trouble may rise again if Rani was released.\n\n## Life in independent\nIndia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rani_Gaidinliu&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Life in independent India\")]\n\nAfter the [Interim Government of India](/wiki/Interim_Government_of_India\n\"Interim Government of India\") was set up in 1946, Rani Gaidinliu was released\non [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India \"Prime Minister of India\")\nNehru's orders from Tura jail, having spent 14 years in various prisons. She\ncontinued to work for the upliftment of her people after her release. She\nstayed at Vimrap village of [Tuensang](/wiki/Tuensang \"Tuensang\") with her\nyounger brother Marang till 1952. In 1952, she was finally allowed to move\nback to her native village of Longkao. In 1953, Prime Minister Nehru visited\nImphal where Rani Gaidinliu met and conveyed to him the gratitude and goodwill\nof her people. Later she met Nehru in [Delhi](/wiki/Delhi \"Delhi\") to discuss\nthe development and welfare of Zeliangrong people.\n\nGaidinliu was opposed to the [Naga National\nCouncil](/wiki/Naga_National_Council \"Naga National Council\") (NNC)\ninsurgents, who advocated secessionism from India. Instead, she campaigned for\na separate Zeliangrong territory within the Union of India.[2]:147 The rebel\nNaga leaders criticized Gaidinliu’s movement for the integration of\nZeliangrong tribes under one administrative unit. They were also opposed to\nher working for the revival of the traditional Naga religion of animism or\n_[Heraka](/wiki/Heraka \"Heraka\")_. The NNC leaders considered her actions an\nobstacle to their own movement. The\n[Baptist](/wiki/Nagaland_Baptist_Church_Council \"Nagaland Baptist Church\nCouncil\") leaders deemed the _Heraka_ revival movement anti-Christian and she\nwas warned of serious consequences if she were not to change her stand. In\norder to defend the _Heraka_ culture and to strengthen her position, she went\nunderground in 1960.[8] She organized a private army of about a thousand men\nequipped rifles to defend and press for her demand for a single [Zeliangrong\ndistrict](/wiki/Zeliangrong \"Zeliangrong\"). In response to\n[Phizo](/wiki/Angami_Zapu_Phizo \"Angami Zapu Phizo\")'s declaration of the\n\"Naga Federal Government\", she set up her own quasi-administration named the\n\"Zeliangrong Government of Rani Party\". In 1964, the overground Zeliangrong\nleaders in consultation with underground leaders led by Rani Gaidinliu,\ndemanded \"a separate Zeliangrong Administrative Unit or Political Unit\" within\nthe [Union of India](/wiki/Union_of_India \"Union of India\"). On 29 January\n1965, her followers kidnapped and killed nine Naga rebels from the Ngulong\nvillage of the Kohima district, causing great uproar.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn 1966, after six years of hard underground life in old age, under an\nagreement with the [Government of India](/wiki/Government_of_India \"Government\nof India\"), Rani Gaidinliu came out from her jungle hideout to work for the\nbetterment of her people through peaceful, democratic and non-violent means.\nShe went to Kohima on 20 January 1966, and met the Prime Minister Lal Bahadur\nShastri in Delhi on 21 February 1966, demanding the creation of a separate\nZeliangrong administrative unit. On 24 September 320 of her followers\nsurrendered at Henima. Some of them were absorbed into the [Nagaland Armed\nPolice](/wiki/Nagaland_Police \"Nagaland Police\").\n\nDuring her stay at [Kohima](/wiki/Kohima \"Kohima\"), she was conferred\n\"Tamrapatra Freedom Fighter Award\" in 1972, the [Padma\nBhushan](/wiki/Padma_Bhushan \"Padma Bhushan\") (1982)[9] and the [Vivekananda\nSeva Award](/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda \"Swami Vivekananda\") (1983).\n\n## Death[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rani_Gaidinliu&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Death\")]\n\nIn 1991, Gaidinliu returned to her birthplace Longkao, where she died on 17\nFebruary 1993 at the age of 78.[10][11]\n\nThe [Governor of Manipur](/wiki/Governor_of_Manipur \"Governor of Manipur\"),\n[Chintamani Panigrahi](/wiki/Chintamani_Panigrahi \"Chintamani Panigrahi\"), the\nHome Secretary of Nagaland, officials from Manipur and many people from all\nparts of the [North Eastern region](/wiki/North-East_India \"North-East India\")\nattended her funeral at her native village. In Imphal, the [Chief Minister of\nManipur](/wiki/Chief_Minister_of_Manipur \"Chief Minister of Manipur\") R.K.\nDorendro Singh, Deputy Chief Minister, [Rishang\nKeishing](/wiki/Rishang_Keishing \"Rishang Keishing\") and others paid floral\ntributes and a general holiday was declared by the [State\nGovernment](/wiki/Government_of_Manipur \"Government of Manipur\").\n\nRani Gaidinliu was also conferred the _[Birsa Munda](/wiki/Birsa_Munda \"Birsa\nMunda\") Award_ posthumously. The [Government of\nIndia](/wiki/Government_of_India \"Government of India\") issued a postal stamp\nin her honour in 1996.[5][12]The Government of India issued a commemorative\ncoin in her honour in 2015.[13]\n\n## Legacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rani_Gaidinliu&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Legacy\")]\n\nBecause of the Heraka movement's hostility towards Christianity, Gaidinliu's\nheroics were not acknowledged highly among the Nagas, most of whom had\nconverted to Christianity by the 1960s. The [Naga\nnationalist](/wiki/Naga_nationalism \"Naga nationalism\") groups don't recognize\nher either, because she was considered close to the Government of India. When\nthe Hindu nationalist [Sangh Parivar](/wiki/Sangh_Parivar \"Sangh Parivar\")\naligned with the Heraka movement in the 1970s, the perception that she was a\npromoter of Hinduism grew stronger among the Christian Nagas.[14]\n\nIn 2015, when the Central government and [T. R. Zeliang](/wiki/T._R._Zeliang\n\"T. R. Zeliang\")'s state government decided to construct a Gaidinliu memorial\nhall, several civil society organizations in the [Nagaland](/wiki/Nagaland\n\"Nagaland\") state opposed the move.[15]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rani_Gaidinliu&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Kusumlata Nayyar (2002).
