It was held on Tuesday, November 7, 2000.\n[Republican](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party\n\\(United States\\)\") candidate [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W.\nBush\"), then-incumbent [governor of Texas](/wiki/Governor_of_Texas \"Governor\nof Texas\") and the eldest son of the 41st President [George H.

Bush was seen as the early favorite for the Republican\nnomination and, despite a contentious primary battle with Senator [John\nMcCain](/wiki/John_McCain \"John McCain\") and other candidates, secured the\nnomination by [Super Tuesday](/wiki/Super_Tuesday \"Super Tuesday\"). Bush chose\nformer [Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense \"United\nStates Secretary of Defense\") [Dick Cheney](/wiki/Dick_Cheney \"Dick Cheney\")\nas his running mate, while Gore chose Senator [Joe\nLieberman](/wiki/Joe_Lieberman \"Joe Lieberman\") as his. Both major party\ncandidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax\nrelief, and reforms for federal [social insurance](/wiki/Social_insurance\n\"Social insurance\") programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Clinton\nand Gore often did not campaign together, a deliberate decision resulting from\nthe [Lewinsky sex scandal](/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal \"Lewinsky scandal\") two\nyears prior.\n\nThis was the closest presidential election in the nation's history, with a\n.009% margin, 537 votes, separating the two candidates in the decisive state,\n[Florida](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Florida,_2000 \"United\nStates presidential election in Florida, 2000\"). The narrow margin there\ntriggered a mandatory machine recount the next day, after which Gore requested\nhand recounts in four counties, including three in populous South Florida, as\npermitted by law. Litigation ensued in numerous counties in both state and\nfederal courts, ultimately reaching the [Florida Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/Florida_Supreme_Court \"Florida Supreme Court\") and the [United\nStates Supreme Court](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court\nof the United States\"). The high court's contentious 5–4 decision in _[Bush v.\nGore](/wiki/Bush_v._Gore \"Bush v. Gore\"),_ announced on December 12, 2000,\nended a statewide recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court on December 8,\neffectively awarding Florida's votes to Bush and granting him the victory.\nNationwide, this was the fourth presidential election in which the winner\n[received fewer votes than his\nopponent](/wiki/United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote\n\"United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular\nvote\").\n\nAfter the election, recounts conducted by various news media organizations\ncontinued a primary focus on ballots that machines read as not showing a vote.\nBased on the review of these ballots, their results indicated that Bush would\nhave won if certain recounting methods had been used (including the one\nfavored by Gore at the time of the Supreme Court decision), but that Gore\nmight have won under other standards and scenarios.[3] In contrast, according\nto Lance deHaven-Smith of Florida State University, based on \"the definitive\nstudy of the uncounted ballots\" (the [Florida Ballot\nProject](/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida#Florida_Ballot_Project_recounts\n\"2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida\") by [NORC at the\nUniversity of Chicago](/wiki/NORC_at_the_University_of_Chicago \"NORC at the\nUniversity of Chicago\")), if all the legally valid votes in Florida had been\ncounted statewide, Gore would have been the winner, a conclusion deHaven-Smith\ncalls \"unambiguous and unavoidable.\"[4]\n\nThe [Green Party](/wiki/Green_Party_of_the_United_States \"Green Party of the\nUnited States\") gained widespread public attention during the 2000\npresidential election when the ticket composed of [Ralph\nNader](/wiki/Ralph_Nader \"Ralph Nader\") and [Winona\nLaDuke](/wiki/Winona_LaDuke \"Winona LaDuke\") won 2.7% of the popular vote.\nNader was vilified by some Democrats, who accused him of\n[spoiling](/wiki/Spoiler_effect \"Spoiler effect\") the election for Gore.\nNader's impact on the 2000 election has remained controversial.\n\nThis was the last time a Republican candidate won an electoral vote in the\nregion of [New England](/wiki/New_England \"New England\") until 2016, with\n[Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\") winning the [2nd\nCongressional District of Maine](/wiki/Maine%27s_2nd_congressional_district\n\"Maine's 2nd congressional district\"). As of 2017, this was the last election\nwhere a Republican candidate won [New Hampshire](/wiki/New_Hampshire \"New\nHampshire\"), and the last time the state of [Iowa](/wiki/Iowa \"Iowa\") backed\nthe losing candidate. Likewise, this was also the first presidential election\nthat Delaware and Pennsylvania, would fail to vote for the winning candidate\nsince 1948, and 1968, with California, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, and New\nJersey all failing to do the same since 1976 respectively as well. This was\nalso the first presidential election since Jimmy Carter's narrow victory in\n1976, that a presidential candidate from either party would win a presidential\nelection with fewer than 300 electoral votes, and the first time a Republican\nwould win without breaking that amount since William McKinley's victory in\n1900.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Democratic Party nomination\n    * 2.1 Candidates gallery\n  * 3 Republican Party nomination\n    * 3.1 Candidates gallery\n  * 4 Other nominations\n    * 4.1 Reform Party nomination\n    * 4.2 Association of State Green Parties nomination\n    * 4.3 Libertarian Party nomination\n    * 4.4 Constitution Party nomination\n    * 4.5 Natural Law Party nomination\n  * 5 General election campaign\n    * 5.1 Presidential debates\n    * 5.2 Notable expressions and phrases\n  * 6 Results\n    * 6.1 Florida recount\n    * 6.2 National results\n    * 6.3 State results\n    * 6.4 Results by state\n      * 6.4.1 Arizona results\n      * 6.4.2 Maine and Nebraska district results\n    * 6.5 Ballot access\n  * 7 Aftermath\n    * 7.1 Post recount\n    * 7.2 Voting machines\n    * 7.3 Exit polling and declaration of vote winners\n    * 7.4 Ralph Nader spoiler effect\n    * 7.5 Press influence on race\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 Footnotes\n  * 10 References\n  * 11 Further reading\n    * 11.1 Books\n    * 11.2 Journal articles\n    * 11.3 Papers\n  * 12 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election,_2000&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nFurther information: [United States presidential election §\nProcedure](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election#Procedure \"United States\npresidential election\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/44_Bill_Clinton_3x4.jpg/170px-44_Bill_Clinton_3x4.jpg)](/wiki/File:44_Bill_Clinton_3x4.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:44_Bill_Clinton_3x4.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\"), the incumbent president in\n2000, whose term expired on January 20, 2001\n\n[Article\nTwo](/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_5:_Qualifications_for_office\n\"Article Two of the United States Constitution\") of the [United States\nConstitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\")\nprovides that the President and Vice President of the United States must be\n[natural-born citizens](/wiki/Natural-born-citizen_clause \"Natural-born-\ncitizen clause\") of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident\nof the United States for a period of at least 14 years. Candidates for the\npresidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties of\nthe United States, in which case each party devises a method (such as a\n[primary election](/wiki/Primary_election \"Primary election\")) to choose the\ncandidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Traditionally,\nthe primary elections are [indirect elections](/wiki/Indirect_election\n\"Indirect election\") where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates\npledged to a particular candidate.

The focus of his campaign was a plan to spend the record-\nbreaking budget surplus on a variety of social welfare programs to help the\npoor and the middle-class, along with campaign finance reform and [gun\ncontrol](/wiki/Gun_control \"Gun control\").\n\nGore easily defeated Bradley in the primaries, largely because of support from\nthe Democratic Party establishment and Bradley's poor showing in the Iowa\ncaucus, where Gore successfully painted Bradley as aloof and indifferent to\nthe plight of farmers. The closest Bradley came to a victory was his 50–46\nloss to Gore in the New Hampshire primary.

Bush became the early front-runner, acquiring unprecedented funding\nand a broad base of leadership support based on his governorship of Texas and\nthe name recognition and connections of the Bush family. Former cabinet member\n[George Shultz](/wiki/George_Shultz \"George Shultz\") played an important early\nrole in securing establishment Republican support for Bush. In April 1998, he\ninvited Bush to discuss policy issues with experts including [Michael\nBoskin](/wiki/Michael_Boskin \"Michael Boskin\"), [John\nTaylor](/wiki/John_B._Taylor \"John B. Taylor\"), and [Condoleezza\nRice](/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice \"Condoleezza Rice\"). The group, which was\n\"looking for a candidate for 2000 with good political instincts, someone they\ncould work with\", was impressed, and Shultz encouraged him to enter the\nrace.[10] Several aspirants withdrew before the [Iowa\nCaucus](/wiki/Iowa_Republican_caucuses,_2000 \"Iowa Republican caucuses, 2000\")\nbecause they were unable to secure funding and endorsements sufficient to\nremain competitive with Bush. These included [Elizabeth\nDole](/wiki/Elizabeth_Dole \"Elizabeth Dole\"), [Dan Quayle](/wiki/Dan_Quayle\n\"Dan Quayle\"), [Lamar Alexander](/wiki/Lamar_Alexander \"Lamar Alexander\"), and\n[Bob Smith](/wiki/Bob_Smith_\\(American_politician\\) \"Bob Smith \\(American\npolitician\\)\"). [Pat Buchanan](/wiki/Pat_Buchanan \"Pat Buchanan\") dropped out\nto run for the Reform Party nomination. That left Bush, [John\nMcCain](/wiki/John_McCain \"John McCain\"), [Alan Keyes](/wiki/Alan_Keyes \"Alan\nKeyes\"), [Steve Forbes](/wiki/Steve_Forbes \"Steve Forbes\"), [Gary\nBauer](/wiki/Gary_Bauer \"Gary Bauer\"), and [Orrin Hatch](/wiki/Orrin_Hatch\n\"Orrin Hatch\") as the only candidates still in the race.\n\nOn January 24, Bush won the Iowa caucus with 41% of the vote. Forbes came in\nsecond with 30% of the vote. Keyes received 14%, Bauer 9%, McCain 5%, and\nHatch 1%. Hatch dropped out. On the national stage, Bush was portrayed in the\nmedia as the establishment candidate. McCain, with the support of many\nmoderate Republicans and Independents, portrayed himself as a crusading\ninsurgent who focused on [campaign reform](/wiki/Electoral_reform \"Electoral\nreform\").\n\nOn February 1, McCain won a 49–30% victory over Bush in the [New Hampshire\nprimary](/wiki/New_Hampshire_Presidential_primary \"New Hampshire Presidential\nprimary\"). Gary Bauer dropped out. After coming in third in Delaware Forbes\ndropped out, leaving three candidates. In the [South Carolina\nprimary](/wiki/South_Carolina_Republican_primary,_2000 \"South Carolina\nRepublican primary, 2000\"), Bush soundly defeated McCain. Some McCain\nsupporters blamed it on the Bush campaign, accusing them of mudslinging and\ndirty tricks, such as [push polling](/wiki/Push_poll \"Push poll\") that implied\nthat McCain's adopted Bangladeshi-born daughter was an African-American child\nhe fathered out of wedlock.[11] While McCain's loss in South Carolina damaged\nhis campaign, he won both Michigan and his home state of Arizona on February\n22. The primary election that year also affected the [South Carolina State\nHouse](/wiki/South_Carolina_State_House \"South Carolina State House\"), when a\ncontroversy about the Confederate flag flying over the capitol dome prompted\nthe state legislature to move the flag to a less prominent position at a\n[Civil War memorial on the capitol\ngrounds](/wiki/Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America#Display_at_South_Carolina's_state_capitol\n\"Flag of the Confederate States of America\"). Most GOP candidates said the\nissue should be left to South Carolina voters, though McCain later recanted\nand said the flag should be removed.[12]\n\nOn February 24, McCain criticized Bush for accepting the endorsement of [Bob\nJones University](/wiki/Bob_Jones_University \"Bob Jones University\") despite\nits policy banning interracial dating. On February 28, McCain also referred to\nRev. [Jerry Falwell](/wiki/Jerry_Falwell \"Jerry Falwell\") and televangelist\n[Pat Robertson](/wiki/Pat_Robertson \"Pat Robertson\") as \"agents of\nintolerance\", a term he would later distance himself from during his [2008\nbid](/wiki/John_McCain_presidential_campaign,_2008 \"John McCain presidential\ncampaign, 2008\"). He lost the state of Virginia to Bush on February 29. On\n[Super Tuesday](/wiki/Super_Tuesday \"Super Tuesday\"), March 7, Bush won New\nYork, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri, California, Maryland, and Maine. McCain won\nRhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, but dropped out of the\nrace. McCain would eventually become the Republican presidential nominee [8\nyears later](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008 \"United States\npresidential election, 2008\"), which he then lost to [Barack\nObama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\"). On March 10, Alan Keyes got 21% of\nthe vote in Utah. Bush took the majority of the remaining contests and won the\nRepublican nomination on March 14, winning his home state of Texas and his\nbrother [Jeb's](/wiki/Jeb_Bush \"Jeb Bush\") home state of Florida among others.\nAt the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia George W. Bush accepted\nthe nomination of the Republican party.\n\nBush asked former [Secretary of\nDefense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense \"United States Secretary of\nDefense\") [Dick Cheney](/wiki/Dick_Cheney \"Dick Cheney\") to head up a team to\nhelp select a running mate for him, but ultimately, Bush decided that Cheney\nhimself should be the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution\ndoes not specifically disallow a president and a vice president from the same\nstate, it does prohibit electors from casting both of his or her votes for\npersons from his or her own state. Accordingly, Cheney—who had been a resident\nof [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\") for nearly 10 years—changed his voting\nregistration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or Bush\nwould have forfeited their electoral votes from the Texas electors.\n\nDelegate totals\n\n  * Governor George W.

Bush criticized [Clinton\nadministration](/wiki/Clinton_administration \"Clinton administration\")\npolicies in [Somalia](/wiki/Somalia \"Somalia\"), where 18 Americans died in\n1993 trying to sort out warring factions, and in the Balkans, where United\nStates peacekeeping troops perform a variety of functions. \"I don't think our\ntroops ought to be used for what's called [nation-building](/wiki/Nation-\nbuilding \"Nation-building\"),\" Bush said in the second [presidential\ndebate](/wiki/American_presidential_debate \"American presidential\ndebate\").[21] Bush also pledged to bridge partisan gaps in the nation's\ncapital, claiming the atmosphere in Washington stood in the way of progress on\nnecessary reforms.[22] Gore, meanwhile, questioned Bush's fitness for the job,\npointing to gaffes made by Bush in interviews and speeches and suggesting the\nTexas governor lacked the necessary experience to be president.\n\n[Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\")'s\n[impeachment](/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton \"Impeachment of Bill Clinton\")\nand the [sex scandal](/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal \"Lewinsky scandal\") that led up\nto it cast a shadow on the campaign, particularly on his vice president's run\nto replace him. Republicans strongly denounced the Clinton scandals,\nparticularly Bush, who made his repeated promise to restore \"honor and\ndignity\" to the White House a centerpiece of his campaign. Gore studiously\navoided the Clinton scandals, as did Lieberman, even though Lieberman had been\nthe first Democratic senator to denounce Clinton's misbehavior. In fact, some\nmedia observers theorized that Gore actually chose Lieberman in an attempt to\nseparate himself from Clinton's past misdeeds, and help blunt the GOP's\nattempts to link him to his boss.[23] Others pointed to the passionate kiss\nGore gave his wife during the [Democratic\nConvention](/wiki/2000_Democratic_National_Convention \"2000 Democratic\nNational Convention\"), as a signal that despite the allegations against\nClinton, Gore himself was a faithful husband.[24] Gore avoided appearing with\nClinton, who was shunted to low visibility appearances in areas where he was\npopular. Experts have argued that this could have cost Gore votes from some of\nClinton's core supporters.[25][26]\n\n[Ralph Nader](/wiki/Ralph_Nader \"Ralph Nader\") was the most successful of\nthird-party candidates.

Gore balanced\nBush by sweeping the [Northeastern United\nStates](/wiki/Northeastern_United_States \"Northeastern United States\") (with\nthe sole exception of [New Hampshire](/wiki/New_Hampshire \"New Hampshire\"),\nwhich Bush won narrowly), most of the [Upper Midwest](/wiki/Upper_Midwest\n\"Upper Midwest\"), and all of the Pacific Coast states as well as\n[Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii \"Hawaii\") and [New Mexico](/wiki/New_Mexico \"New\nMexico\").\n\nAs the night wore on, the returns in a handful of small-to-medium-sized\nstates, including [Wisconsin](/wiki/Wisconsin \"Wisconsin\") and\n[Iowa](/wiki/Iowa \"Iowa\"), were extremely close; however, it was the state of\nFlorida that would decide the winner of the election. As the final national\nresults were tallied the following morning, Bush had clearly won a total of\n246 electoral votes, while Gore had won 249 votes. Two hundred and seventy\nvotes were needed to win. Two smaller states — [Wisconsin](/wiki/Wisconsin\n\"Wisconsin\") (10 electoral votes) and Oregon (7 electoral votes) — were still\ntoo close to call. It was Florida (25 electoral votes), however, on which the\n[news media](/wiki/News_media \"News media\") focused its attention.\nMathematically, Florida's 25 electoral votes became the key to an election win\nfor either candidate. Although both Wisconsin and Oregon were declared in\nfavor of Gore over the next few days, Florida's statewide vote took center\nstage because that state's winner would ultimately win the election. The\noutcome of the election was not known for more than a month after the\nballoting ended because of the time required to count and recount Florida's\npresidential ballots.\n\n### Florida\nrecount[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election,_2000&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Florida recount\")]\n\nMain article: [2000 United States presidential election recount in\nFlorida](/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida\n\"2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/TallahaseePalmBeachBallotBox1.jpg/170px-\nTallahaseePalmBeachBallotBox1.jpg)](/wiki/File:TallahaseePalmBeachBallotBox1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:TallahaseePalmBeachBallotBox1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n2000 Palm Beach County voting stand and ballot box\n\nBetween 7:50 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. EST on election day, just before the polls\nclosed in the largely Republican Florida panhandle, which is in the Central\ntime zone, all major television news networks (CNN, NBC, FOX, CBS and ABC)\ndeclared that Gore had carried Florida's 25 electoral votes. They based this\nprediction substantially on [exit polls](/wiki/Exit_poll \"Exit poll\").\nHowever, in the actual vote tally Bush began to take a wide lead early in\nFlorida, and by 10 p.m. EST the networks had retracted that prediction and\nplaced Florida back into the \"undecided\" column. At approximately 2:30 a.m.,\nwith some 85% of the votes counted in Florida and Bush leading Gore by more\nthan 100,000 votes, the networks declared that Bush had carried Florida and\ntherefore had been elected president. However, most of the remaining votes to\nbe counted in Florida were located in three heavily Democratic\ncounties—[Broward](/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida \"Broward County, Florida\"),\n[Miami-Dade](/wiki/Miami-Dade_County \"Miami-Dade County\"), and [Palm\nBeach](/wiki/Palm_Beach_County \"Palm Beach County\")—and as their votes were\nreported Gore began to gain on Bush. By 4:30 a.m., after all votes were\ncounted, Gore had narrowed Bush's margin to under 2,000 votes, and the\nnetworks retracted their predictions that Bush had won Florida and the\npresidency. Gore, who had privately conceded the election to Bush, withdrew\nhis concession. The final result in Florida was slim enough to require a\nmandatory recount (by machine) under state law; Bush's lead dwindled to just\nover 900 votes when it was completed the day after the election. On November\n8, Florida Division of Elections staff prepared a press release for Secretary\nof State Harris that said overseas ballots must be \"postmarked or signed and\ndated\" by Election Day. It was never released.[4]:16 A count of the overseas\nballots later boosted Bush's margin to 930 votes. (According to a report by\n_The New York Times_ , 680 of the accepted overseas ballots were received\nafter the legal deadline, lacked required postmarks, were unsigned or undated,\ncast after election day, from unregistered voters or voters not requesting\nballots, lacked a witness signature or address, or were double-counted.[41])\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/1116c6_%285124003635%29.jpg/220px-1116c6_%285124003635%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:1116c6_\\(5124003635\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1116c6_\\(5124003635\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFlorida Supreme Court during the recount\n\nMost of the post-electoral controversy revolved around Gore's request for hand\nrecounts in four counties (Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and\n[Volusia](/wiki/Volusia_County,_Florida \"Volusia County, Florida\")), as\nprovided under Florida state law. [Florida Secretary of\nState](/wiki/Florida_Secretary_of_State \"Florida Secretary of State\")\n[Katherine Harris](/wiki/Katherine_Harris \"Katherine Harris\") (also the co-\nchair of George W. Bush's election efforts in Florida) announced she would\nreject any revised totals from those counties if they were not turned in by\n5:00 p.m. on November 14, the statutory deadline for amended returns. The\n[Florida Supreme Court](/wiki/Florida_Supreme_Court \"Florida Supreme Court\")\nextended the deadline to November 26, a decision later [vacated](/wiki/Vacated\n\"Vacated\") by the [U.S. Supreme Court](/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court \"U.S. Supreme\nCourt\"). Miami-Dade eventually halted its recount and resubmitted its original\ntotal to the state canvassing board, while Palm Beach County failed to meet\nthe extended deadline, turning in its completed recount results at 7:00 p.m.,\nwhich Harris indeed rejected. On November 26, the state canvassing board\ncertified Bush the winner of Florida's electors by 537 votes. Gore formally\ncontested the certified results. A state court decision overruling Gore was\nreversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of over 70,000\nballots previously rejected as undervotes by machine counters. The U.S.\nSupreme Court halted that order the next day, with Justice Scalia issuing a\nconcurring opinion that \"the counting of votes that are of questionable\nlegality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner\" (Bush).[42]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/20.ElectionProtest.USSC.WDC.11December2000_%2821746677994%29.jpg/220px-20.ElectionProtest.USSC.WDC.11December2000_%2821746677994%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:20.ElectionProtest.USSC.WDC.11December2000_\\(21746677994\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:20.ElectionProtest.USSC.WDC.11December2000_\\(21746677994\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nSupporters for the Gore-Lieberman ticket outside the [U.S. Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court \"U.S. Supreme Court\")\n\nOn December 12, the Supreme Court [ruled](/wiki/Bush_v._Gore \"Bush v.

With only two hours remaining until\nthe December 12 deadline, the Supreme Court's order effectively ended the\nrecount, and the previously certified total held.\n\nEven if the Supreme Court had decided differently in Bush v. Gore, the Florida\nLegislature had been meeting in Special Session since December 8 with the sole\nstated purpose being the selection of a slate of electors on December 12,\nshould the dispute still be ongoing.[43][44] Had the recount gone forward, it\nwould have awarded those electors to Bush, based on the state-certified vote,\nand the likely last recourse for Gore would have been to contest the electors\nin the United States Congress. The electors would then only have been rejected\nif both GOP-controlled houses had agreed to reject them.[45]\n\n### National\nresults[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election,_2000&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: National results\")]\n\nThough Gore came in second in the electoral vote, he received 547,398 more\npopular votes than Bush,[46] making him the first person since [Grover\nCleveland](/wiki/Grover_Cleveland \"Grover Cleveland\") in\n[1888](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1888 \"United States\npresidential election, 1888\") to win the popular vote but lose in the\nElectoral College.[47] Gore failed to win the popular vote in his home state,\n[Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee \"Tennessee\"), which both he and his father had\nrepresented in the Senate, making him the first major-party presidential\ncandidate to have lost his home state since [George\nMcGovern](/wiki/George_McGovern \"George McGovern\") lost [South\nDakota](/wiki/South_Dakota \"South Dakota\") in\n[1972](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1972 \"United States\npresidential election, 1972\"). Furthermore, Gore lost [West\nVirginia](/wiki/West_Virginia \"West Virginia\"), a state that had voted\nRepublican only once in the previous six presidential elections,[48] and Bill\nClinton's home state of [Arkansas](/wiki/Arkansas \"Arkansas\"), which had voted\ntwice before to elect Gore vice president.

Bush also lost in Connecticut, the state of his birth.

Those were Charles County, Maryland; and Orange\nCounty Florida, both rapidly diversifying counties.

Twenty members of the [House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\"), most of them Democratic members of the\n[Congressional Black Caucus](/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus \"Congressional\nBlack Caucus\"), rose one-by-one to file objections to the electoral votes of\nFlorida. However, pursuant to the [Electoral Count Act of\n1887](/wiki/Electoral_Commission_\\(United_States\\)#Aftermath \"Electoral\nCommission \\(United States\\)\"), any such objection had to be sponsored by both\na representative and a [senator](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States\nSenate\"). No senator would co-sponsor these objections, deferring to the\nSupreme Court's ruling. Therefore, Gore, who presided in his capacity as\n[President of the Senate](/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States \"Vice\nPresident of the United States\"), ruled each of these objections out of\norder.[56]\n\nSubsequently, the joint session of Congress certified the electoral votes from\nall 50 states and the District of Columbia. Bush took the oath of office on\nJanuary 20, 2001. He would serve for the next eight years. Gore has not, as of\n2017, considered another presidential run, remaining neutral in the Democratic\nprimaries of 2004, 2008, and 2016.\n\nThe first independent recount of undervotes was conducted by the _Miami\nHerald_ and _USA Today_. The commission found that under most scenarios for\ncompletion of the initiated recounts, Bush would have won the election;\nhowever, Gore would have won using the most generous standards for\nundervotes.[57]\n\nUltimately, a media consortium—comprising _The New York Times_ , _The\nWashington Post_ , _The Wall Street Journal_ , Tribune Co. (parent of the _Los\nAngeles Times_), Associated Press, CNN, _The Palm Beach Post_ and the _St.\nPetersburg Times_[58]—hired [NORC](/wiki/National_Opinion_Research_Center\n\"National Opinion Research Center\") at the [University of\nChicago](/wiki/University_of_Chicago \"University of Chicago\")[59] to examine\n175,010 ballots that were collected from the entire state, not just the\ndisputed counties that were recounted; these ballots contained undervotes\n(ballots with no machine-detected choice made for president) and overvotes\n(ballots with more than one choice marked). Their goal was to determine the\nreliability and accuracy of the systems used for the voting process. Based on\nthe NORC review, the media group concluded that if the disputes over all the\nballots in question had been resolved by applying statewide any of five\nstandards that would have met Florida's legal standard for recounts, the\nelectoral result would have been reversed and Gore would have won by 60 to 171\nvotes. (Any analysis of NORC data requires, for each punch ballot, at least\ntwo of the three ballot reviewers' codes to agree or instead, for all three to\nagree.) For all undervotes and overvotes statewide, these five standards\nare:[4][60][61]\n\n  * Prevailing standard – accepts at least one detached corner of a chad and all affirmative marks on optical scan ballots.\n  * County-by-county standard – applies each county's own standards independently.\n  * Two-corner standard – accepts at least two detached corners of a chad and all affirmative marks on optical scan ballots.\n  * Most restrictive standard – accepts only so-called perfect ballots that machines somehow missed and did not count, or ballots with unambiguous expressions of voter intent.\n  * Most inclusive standard – applies uniform criteria of \"dimple or better\" on punch marks and all affirmative marks on optical scan ballots.\n\nSuch a statewide review including all uncounted votes was a tangible\npossibility, as Leon County Circuit Court Judge [Terry\nLewis](/wiki/Terry_Lewis_\\(Florida_judge\\) \"Terry Lewis \\(Florida judge\\)\"),\nwhom the Florida Supreme Court had assigned to oversee the statewide recount,\nhad scheduled a hearing for December 13 (mooted by the U.S. Supreme Court's\nfinal ruling on the 12th) to consider the question of including overvotes as\nwell as undervotes. Subsequent statements by Judge Lewis and internal court\ndocuments support the likelihood of including overvotes in the recount.[62]\n[Florida State University](/wiki/Florida_State_University \"Florida State\nUniversity\") professor of public policy Lance deHaven-Smith observed that,\neven considering only undervotes, \"under any of the five most reasonable\ninterpretations of the Florida Supreme Court ruling, Gore does, in fact, more\nthan make up the deficit\".[4] [Fairness and Accuracy in\nReporting](/wiki/Fairness_and_Accuracy_in_Reporting \"Fairness and Accuracy in\nReporting\")'s analysis of the NORC study and media coverage of it supports\nthese interpretations and criticizes the coverage of the study by media\noutlets such as _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York\nTimes\")_ and the other media consortium members.[58]\n\nFurther, according to sociologists [Christopher Uggen](/wiki/Christopher_Uggen\n\"Christopher Uggen\") and Jeff Manza, the 2000 election might have gone to Al\nGore if the disenfranchised population of Florida had voted. Florida law\ndisenfranchises convicted felons, requiring individual applications to regain\nsuffrage. In their 2002 _American Sociological Review_ article, Uggen and\nManza found that the released felon vote could have altered the outcome of\nseven senatorial races between 1978 and 2000, and the 2000 presidential\nelection.[63] Matt Ford noted their study concluded \"if the state's 827,000\ndisenfranchised felons had voted at the same rate as other Floridians,\nDemocratic candidate Al Gore would have won Florida—and the presidency—by more\nthan 80,000 votes.\"[64] The effect of Florida's law is such that in 2014\n\"[m]ore than one in ten Floridians – and nearly one in four African-American\nFloridians – are shut out of the polls because of felony convictions.\"[65]\n\n### Voting\nmachines[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election,_2000&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Voting machines\")]\n\nBecause the 2000 presidential election was so close in Florida, the United\nStates government and state governments pushed for [election\nreform](/wiki/Election_reform \"Election reform\") to be prepared by the [2004\npresidential election](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2004 \"United\nStates presidential election, 2004\"). Many of Florida's year 2000 election\nnight problems stemmed from [usability](/wiki/Usability \"Usability\") and\nballot design factors with voting systems, including the potentially confusing\n\"[butterfly ballot](/wiki/Butterfly_ballot \"Butterfly ballot\")\". Many voters\nhad difficulties with the paper-based [punch\ncard](/wiki/Voting_machine#Punch_card \"Voting machine\") voting machines and\nwere either unable to understand the required process for voting or unable to\nperform the process. This resulted in an unusual amount of\n[overvote](/wiki/Overvote \"Overvote\") (voting for more candidates than is\nallowed) and [undervotes](/wiki/Undervote \"Undervote\") (voting for fewer than\nthe minimum candidates, including none at all). Many undervotes were caused by\nvoter error, unmaintained punch card voting booths, or errors having to do\nmerely with the characteristics of punch card ballots (resulting in hanging,\ndimpled, or pregnant [chads](/wiki/Chad_\\(paper\\) \"Chad \\(paper\\)\")).\n\nA proposed solution to these problems was the installation of modern\n[electronic voting](/wiki/Electronic_voting \"Electronic voting\") machines. The\nUnited States presidential election of 2000 spurred the debate about election\nand voting reform, but it did not end it.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, the [Help America Vote\nAct](/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act \"Help America Vote Act\") (HAVA) was passed to\nhelp states upgrade their election technology in the hopes of preventing\nsimilar problems in future elections. Unfortunately, the electronic voting\nsystems that many states purchased to comply with HAVA actually caused\nproblems in the presidential election of 2004.[66]\n\n### Exit polling and declaration of vote\nwinners[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election,_2000&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Exit polling and declaration of vote winners\")]\n\nThe [Voter News Service](/wiki/Voter_News_Service \"Voter News Service\")'s\nreputation was damaged by its treatment of Florida's presidential vote in\n2000. Breaking its own guidelines,[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] VNS\ncalled the state as a win for Gore 12 minutes before polls closed in the\n[Florida panhandle](/wiki/Florida_Panhandle \"Florida Panhandle\"). Although\nmost of the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, counties in the Florida\npanhandle, located in the Central Time Zone, had not yet closed their polls.\nDiscrepancies between the results of exit polls and the actual vote count\ncaused the VNS to change its call twice, first from Gore to Bush and then to\n\"too close to call\". Due in part to this (and other polling\ninaccuracies)[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] the VNS was disbanded in 2003.\n\nAccording to Bush adviser [Karl Rove](/wiki/Karl_Rove \"Karl Rove\"), exit polls\nearly in the afternoon on election day showed Gore winning by three percentage\npoints, but when the networks called the state for Gore, Bush led by about\n75,000 votes in raw tallies from the [Florida Secretary of\nState](/wiki/Florida_Secretary_of_State \"Florida Secretary of State\").\n\nAlso, charges of media bias were leveled against the networks by Republicans.\nThey claimed that the networks called states more quickly for Al Gore than for\nGeorge W. Bush. Congress held hearings on this matter,[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] and the\nnetworks claimed to have no intentional bias in their election night\nreporting. However, a study of the calls made on election night 2000 indicated\nthat states carried by Gore were called more quickly than states won by\nBush[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]; however, notable Bush states, like New Hampshire and Florida, were\nvery close, and close Gore states like Iowa, Oregon, New Mexico and Wisconsin\nwere called late as well.[67]\n\nThe early call of Florida for Gore has been alleged to have cost Bush several\nclose states, including Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wisconsin.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In each\nof these states, Gore won by less than 10,000 votes, and the polls closed\nafter the networks called Florida for Gore. Because the Florida call was\nwidely seen as an indicator that Gore had won the election, it is possible\nthat it depressed Republican turnout in these states during the final hours of\nvoting, giving Gore the slim margin by which he carried each of\nthem.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] Had Bush carried all four of these states, he would have been able\nto win the electoral vote, even with a loss in Florida. Likewise, the call may\nhave affected the outcome of the [Senate election in Washington\nstate](/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Washington,_2000 \"United States\nSenate election in Washington, 2000\"), where incumbent Republican [Slade\nGorton](/wiki/Slade_Gorton \"Slade Gorton\") was defeated by approximately 2,000\nvotes statewide.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Ralph Nader spoiler\neffect[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election,_2000&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Ralph Nader spoiler effect\")]\n\nFurther information: [Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000 § The \"spoiler\"\ncontroversy](/wiki/Ralph_Nader_presidential_campaign,_2000#The_\"spoiler\"_controversy\n\"Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000\")\n\nMany Gore supporters claimed that third-party candidate Nader acted as a\n[spoiler](/wiki/Spoiler_effect \"Spoiler effect\") in the election since Nader\nvotes could have been cast for Gore, and for instance, Nader allegedly threw\nthe election outcome to Bush.[68] Nader received 2.74 percent of the popular\nvote nationwide, getting 97,000 votes in Florida (by comparison, there were\n111,251 [overvotes](/wiki/Overvotes \"Overvotes\"))[69][70] and 22,000 votes in\nNew Hampshire, where Bush beat Gore by 7,000 votes. Winning either state would\nhave won the general election for Gore. Defenders of Nader, including [Dan\nPerkins](/wiki/Tom_Tomorrow \"Tom Tomorrow\"), argued that the margin in Florida\nwas small enough that Democrats could blame any number of third-party\ncandidates for the defeat, including [Workers World\nParty](/wiki/Workers_World_Party \"Workers World Party\") candidate [Monica\nMoorehead](/wiki/Monica_Moorehead \"Monica Moorehead\"), who received 1,500\nvotes.[71] But the controversy with Nader also drained energy from the\nDemocratic party as divisive debate went on in the months leading up to the\nelection.\n\nNader's reputation was hurt by this perception, which may have hindered his\ngoals as an activist. For example, _[Mother\nJones](/wiki/Mother_Jones_\\(magazine\\) \"Mother Jones \\(magazine\\)\")_ wrote\nabout the so-called \"rank-and-file liberals\" who saw Nader negatively after\nthe election and pointed that [Public Citizen](/wiki/Public_Citizen \"Public\nCitizen\"), the organization Nader founded in 1971, had a new fundraising\nproblem in its own founder, citing a drop in contributions. Mother Jones also\ncited a Public Citizen's letter sent out to people interested in Nader's\nrelation with the organization at that time, with the disclaimer: \"Although\nRalph Nader was our founder, he has not held an official position in the\norganization since 1980 and does not serve on the board. Public Citizen—and\nthe other groups that Mr. Nader founded—act independently.\"[72]\n\nDemocratic party strategist and [Democratic Leadership\nCouncil](/wiki/Democratic_Leadership_Council \"Democratic Leadership Council\")\n(DLC) chair [Al From](/wiki/Al_From \"Al From\") expressed a different view. In\nthe January 24, 2001, issue[73] of the DLC's _Blueprint_ magazine,[74] he\nwrote, \"I think they're wrong on all counts. The assertion that Nader's\nmarginal vote hurt Gore is not borne out by polling data. When exit pollers\nasked voters how they would have voted in a two-way race, Bush actually won by\na point. That was better than he did with Nader in the race.\"\n\nIn an online article published by _[Salon.com](/wiki/Salon.com \"Salon.com\")_\non Tuesday, November 28, 2000, progressive activist [Jim\nHightower](/wiki/Jim_Hightower \"Jim Hightower\") mentioned that in Florida, a\nstate Gore lost by only 537 votes, 24,000 Democrats voted for Nader, while\nanother 308,000 Democrats voted for Bush. According to Hightower, 191,000\nself-described Liberals in Florida voted for Bush, while fewer than 34,000\nvoted for Nader. Wrote Hightower:\n\n> Even when Gore went skittering across the country in August on a widely\n> ballyhooed \"Working Families Tour,\" he had the Clinton administration's\n> favorite Wall Streeter, [Robert Rubin](/wiki/Robert_Rubin \"Robert Rubin\"),\n> by his side, sending a stage wink to the corporate powers, assuring them\n> that all his [Gore's] quasi-populist posturing was only rhetoric – not to\n> worry, Rubin still has a grip on policy.[75]\n\n### Press influence on\nrace[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election,_2000&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Press influence on race\")]\n\nIn their 2007 book _The Nightly News Nightmare: Network Television 's Coverage\nof US Presidential Elections, 1988–2004_, professors Stephen J. Farnsworth and\nS. Robert Lichter alleged most media outlets influenced the outcome of the\nelection through the use of [horse race\njournalism](/wiki/Horse_race_journalism \"Horse race journalism\").[76] Some\nliberal supporters of Al Gore argued that the media had a bias against Gore\nand in favor of Bush. Peter Hart and Jim Naureckas, two commentators for\n[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting](/wiki/Fairness_and_Accuracy_in_Reporting\n\"Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting\") (FAIR), called the media \"serial\nexaggerators\" and alleged that several media outlets were constantly\nexaggerating criticism of Gore:[77] they alleged that the media falsely\nclaimed Gore lied when he claimed he spoke in an overcrowded science class in\nSarasota, Florida,[77] and also alleged the media gave Bush a pass on certain\nissues, such as Bush allegedly exaggerating how much money he signed into the\nannual Texas state budget to help the uninsured during his second debate with\nGore in October 2000.[77] In the April 2000 issue of _[Washington\nMonthly](/wiki/Washington_Monthly \"Washington Monthly\")_ , columnist [Robert\nParry](/wiki/Robert_Parry_\\(journalist\\) \"Robert Parry \\(journalist\\)\") also\nalleged that media outlets exaggerated Gore's supposed claim that he\n\"discovered\" the [Love Canal](/wiki/Love_Canal \"Love Canal\") neighborhood in\n[Niagara Falls, New York](/wiki/Niagara_Falls,_New_York \"Niagara Falls, New\nYork\") during a campaign speech in Concord, New Hampshire on November 30,\n1999,[78] when he had only claimed he \"found\" it after it was already\nevacuated in 1978 because of chemical contamination.[78] _[Rolling\nStone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ columnist [Eric\nBoehlert](/wiki/Eric_Boehlert \"Eric Boehlert\") also alleged media outlets\nexaggerated criticism of Gore as early as July 22, 1999,[79] when Gore, known\nfor being an environmentalist, had a friend release 500 million gallons of\nwater into a drought stricken river to help keep his boat afloat for a photo\nshoot;[79] Boehlert claimed that media outlets exaggerated the actual number\nof gallons that were released, as they claimed it was 4 billion.[79]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election,_2000&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png)[United States portal](/wiki/Portal:United_States \"Portal:United States\")\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg/28px-A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png)](/wiki/File:A_coloured_voting_box.svg)[Politics portal](/wiki/Portal:Politics \"Portal:Politics\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Blue_iPod_Nano.jpg/12px-Blue_iPod_Nano.jpg)[2000s portal](/wiki/Portal:2000s \"Portal:2000s\")\n\n  * _[Bush v.
