The concept often affects other individuals' notions\nabout the individual that is exhibiting mirroring behaviors, which can lead to\nthe individual building [rapport](/wiki/Rapport \"Rapport\") with others.\n\nMirroring is the subconscious replication of another person's nonverbal\nsignals.[1] This concept takes place in everyday interactions, and often goes\nunnoticed by both the person enacting the mirroring behaviors as well as the\nindividual who is being mirrored. The activation of [mirror\nneurons](/wiki/Mirror_neurons \"Mirror neurons\") takes place within the\nindividual who begins to mirror another's movements, and allows them a greater\nconnection and understanding with the individual who they are mirroring, as\nwell as allowing the individual who is being mirrored to feel a stronger\nconnection with the other individual. Mirroring is distinct from conscious\n[imitation](/wiki/Imitation \"Imitation\") under the premise that while the\nlatter is a conscious, typically overt effort to copy another person,\nmirroring is subconsciously done during the act and often goes unnoticed.\n\nThe display of mirroring often begins as early as infancy, as babies begin to\nmimic individuals around them and establish connections with particular body\nmovements.[2] The ability to mimic another person's actions allows the infant\nto establish a sense of empathy and thus begin to understand another person's\nemotions. The infant continues to establish connections with other\nindividual's emotions and subsequently mirror their movements.\n\nMirroring can establish rapport with the individual who is being mirrored, as\nthe similarities in nonverbal gestures allow the individual to feel more\nconnected with the person exhibiting the mirrored behavior.[3] As the two\nindividuals in the situation display similar nonverbal gestures, they may\nbelieve that they share similar attitudes and ideas as well. Mirror neurons\nreact to and cause these movements, allowing the individuals to feel a greater\nsense of engagement and belonging within the situation.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Occurrence\n    * 1.1 Interviews\n    * 1.2 Effects of lacking\n  * 2 Development\n    * 2.1 Self-concept\n    * 2.2 Empathy\n  * 3 Rapport\n    * 3.1 Power dynamics\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n##\nOccurrence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_\\(psychology\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Occurrence\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/President_Reagan_holds_a_oval_office_staff_meeting_1981.jpg/220px-\nPresident_Reagan_holds_a_oval_office_staff_meeting_1981.jpg)](/wiki/File:President_Reagan_holds_a_oval_office_staff_meeting_1981.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:President_Reagan_holds_a_oval_office_staff_meeting_1981.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nMirroring taking place during a meeting with President Reagan.\n\nMirroring generally takes place subconsciously as individuals react with the\nsituation.[1] Mirroring is common in [conversation](/wiki/Conversation\n\"Conversation\"), as the listeners will typically [smile](/wiki/Smile \"Smile\")\nor [frown](/wiki/Frown \"Frown\") along with the speaker, as well as imitate\nbody posture or attitude about the topic. Individuals may be more willing to\nempathize with and accept people whom they believe hold similar interests and\nbeliefs, and thus mirroring the person with whom one is speaking may establish\nconnections between the individuals involved.\n\n###\nInterviews[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_\\(psychology\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Interviews\")]\n\nAdditionally, mirroring may play a role in how well an individual fares in a\njob interview.[4] Within a study conducted by Word, Zanna and Cooper,\ninterviewers were instructed to follow specific types of body language in\ndifferent experimental conditions. In one condition, interviewers were\ninstructed to demonstrate distant and uninterested body language (such as\nleaning away or avoiding eye contact), and in another condition they were\nasked to demonstrate more welcoming body language (such as smiling and making\neye contact). As a result, the individuals being interviewed began to mirror\nthe actions of the interviewer, and thus the individuals in the condition with\nless friendly body language fared worse within the interview than did\nindividuals in the friendly condition. The study demonstrates that the initial\nattitudes that an interviewer may have of the individual being interviewed may\naffect the performance of the interviewee due to mirroring.\n\n### Effects of\nlacking[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_\\(psychology\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Effects of lacking\")]\n\nIndividuals with [autism](/wiki/Autism \"Autism\") or other social difficulties\nmay be less likely to exhibit mirroring, as they may be less subconsciously\nand consciously aware of the actions of others.[5] This factor may cause\nadditional difficulties for the individuals, as without mirroring,\nestablishing connections with other people may be more difficult.\nAdditionally, other individuals may be less likely to build rapport with the\nperson, as without mirroring the person may seem more dissimilar and less\nfriendly. Individuals who are not subconsciously aware of gesture may have\ndifficulties in social situations, as they may be less able to understand\nanother person's perspective without it being explicitly stated, and thus may\nnot understand covert cues that are often used in the social world. It is\npossible, though very rare, for some of these individuals to deliberately\nlearn and become aware of these cues. This, however, is the exception to the\nrule, not the norm.\n\n##\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_\\(psychology\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Matera%2C_Italy._Still_unaware_of_despair%2C_a_small_boy_of_Matera%2C_Italy%2C_unconsciously_repeats_the_gesture_of_his..._-_NARA_-_541739.tif/lossy-\npage1-220px-\nMatera%2C_Italy._Still_unaware_of_despair%2C_a_small_boy_of_Matera%2C_Italy%2C_unconsciously_repeats_the_gesture_of_his..._-_NARA_-_541739.tif.jpg)](/wiki/File:Matera,_Italy._Still_unaware_of_despair,_a_small_boy_of_Matera,_Italy,_unconsciously_repeats_the_gesture_of_his..._-_NARA_-_541739.tif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Matera,_Italy._Still_unaware_of_despair,_a_small_boy_of_Matera,_Italy,_unconsciously_repeats_the_gesture_of_his..._-_NARA_-_541739.tif\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nA young boy mirrors the gesture of his grandmother.\n\nIn infant-parent interactions, mirroring consists of the parent imitating the\ninfant's expressions while vocalizing the emotion implied by the\nexpression.[6] This imitation helps the infant to associate the emotion with\ntheir expression, as well as feel validated in their own emotions as the\nparent shows approval through imitation. Studies have demonstrated that\nmirroring is an important part of child and infant development. According to\n[Kohut's](/wiki/Heinz_Kohut \"Heinz Kohut\") theories of [self-\npsychology](/wiki/Self-psychology \"Self-psychology\"), individuals need a sense\nof validation and belonging in order to establish their concepts of self.[7]\nWhen parents mirror their infants, the action may help the child develop a\ngreater sense of self-awareness and self-control, as they can see their\nemotions within their parent's faces. Additionally, infants may learn and\nexperience new emotions, facial expressions, and gestures by mirroring\nexpressions that their parents utilize. The process of mirroring may help\ninfants establish connections of expressions to emotions and thus promote\nsocial communication later in life. Infants also learn to feel secure and\nvalid in their own emotions through mirroring, as the parent's imitation of\ntheir emotions may help the child recognize their own thoughts and feelings\nmore readily.\n\n### Self-\nconcept[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_\\(psychology\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Self-concept\")]\n\nMain article: [Self-concept](/wiki/Self-concept \"Self-concept\")\n\nMirroring has been shown to play a critical role in the development of an\ninfant's notion of self.[5] The importance of mirroring suggests that infants\nprimarily gather their social skills from their parents, and thus a household\nthat lacks mirroring may inhibit the child's social development. Without\nmirroring, it may be difficult for the child to relate their emotions to\nsocially learned expressions and thus have a difficult experience in\nexpressing their own emotions.\n\n###\nEmpathy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_\\(psychology\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Empathy\")]\n\nMain article: [Empathy](/wiki/Empathy \"Empathy\")\n\nThe inability to properly mirror other individuals may strain the child's\nsocial relationships later in life.[8] This strain may exist because others\nmay feel more distant from the child due to a lack of rapport, or because the\nchild may have a difficult time feeling empathy for others without mirroring.\nMirroring helps to facilitate empathy, as individuals more readily experience\nother people's emotions through mimicking posture and gestures. This empathy\nmay help individuals create lasting relationships and thus excel in social\nsituations. The action of mirroring allows individuals to believe they are\nmore similar to another person, and perceived similarity can be the basis for\ncreating a relationship.\n\n##\nRapport[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_\\(psychology\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Rapport\")]\n\nMain article: [Rapport](/wiki/Rapport \"Rapport\")\n\nRapport may be an important part of social life, as establishing rapport with\nan individual is generally the initial route to becoming friends or\nacquaintances with another person.[3] Mirroring can help establish rapport, as\nexhibiting similar actions, attitudes, and speech patterns as another person\nmay lead them to believe that one is more similar to them and thus more likely\nto be a friend. Individuals may believe that because one replicates the\nindividual's gestures, that one may hold similar beliefs and attitudes as the\nindividual. Mirroring may be more pervasive in close friendships or romantic\nrelationships, as the individuals regard each other highly and thus wish to\nemulate or appease them. Additionally, individuals who are friends may have\nmore similarities than two strangers, and thus may be more likely to exhibit\nsimilar body language regardless of mirroring.\n\n### Power\ndynamics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_\\(psychology\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Power dynamics\")]\n\nMain article: [Power (social and\npolitical)](/wiki/Power_\\(social_and_political\\) \"Power \\(social and\npolitical\\)\")\n\nAdditionally, individuals are likely to mirror the person of higher status or\npower within the situation.[9][10] Mirroring individuals of higher power may\ncreate an illusion of higher status, or create rapport with the individual in\npower, thus allowing the person to gain favor with the individual in power.\nThis mechanism may be helpful for individuals in situations where they are in\na position of [bargaining](/wiki/Bargaining \"Bargaining\") with an individual\nwho possesses more power, as the rapport that mirroring creates may help to\npersuade the higher status individual to help the person of lower status.\nThese situations include [job interviews](/wiki/Job_interviews \"Job\ninterviews\"), other work situations such as requesting promotions, parent-\nchild interactions, and asking professors for favors. Each of these situations\ninvolve one party who is in a more powerless position for bargaining, and\nanother party who has the ability to fulfill the person of lower status's\nneeds, but may not necessarily wish to. Thus, mirroring can be a useful tool\nfor individuals of lower status in order to [persuade](/wiki/Persuade\n\"Persuade\") the other party to relinquish goods or privileges for the lower\nstatus party.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_\\(psychology\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Eye contact](/wiki/Eye_contact \"Eye contact\")\n  * [Facial expression](/wiki/Facial_expression \"Facial expression\")\n  * [Gesture](/wiki/Gesture \"Gesture\")\n  * [Kinesthetic learning](/wiki/Kinesthetic_learning \"Kinesthetic learning\")\n  * [Nonverbal communication](/wiki/Nonverbal_communication \"Nonverbal communication\")\n  * [Mirror stage](/wiki/Mirror_stage \"Mirror stage\")\n  * [Mirror neuron](/wiki/Mirror_neuron \"Mirror neuron\")\n  * [Posture](/wiki/Posture_\\(psychology\\) \"Posture \\(psychology\\)\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_\\(psychology\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Chartrand, T.; Bargh, J.
