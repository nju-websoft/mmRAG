        "# Pygmy goat\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n[![Pygmy goats\nresting](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Pygmy_Goat_on_a_Log.jpg/220px-\nPygmy_Goat_on_a_Log.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pygmy_Goat_on_a_Log.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pygmy_Goat_on_a_Log.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCaramel with black markings\n\nThe **Pygmy goat** is a breed of miniature domestic [goat](/wiki/Goat \"Goat\").\nThe pygmy goat can be used for many different things and that is why a pygmy\ngoat is strictly classified as a multi purpose animal as stated on NPGA or\nnational pygmy goat association. The pygmy goat is quite hardy, an asset in a\nwide variety of settings, and can adapt to virtually all\n[climates](/wiki/Climate \"Climate\").[1] Castrated males are called wethers and\ncan be shown in pet classes. There are also pedigree classes at shows for\nentire goats. There are separate [pedigree](/wiki/Pedigree_\\(animal\\)\n\"Pedigree \\(animal\\)\") lineages in Europe, Africa, (where they are sometimes\ncalled the **African Pygmy**) and the United States. And this is because there\nwere only a few hundred pygmy goats imported from Africa around 60 years ago.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Appearance\n  * 2 Reproduction\n  * 3 Origin\n  * 4 Housing and care\n  * 5 General information\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Appearance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pygmy_goat&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Appearance\")]\n\nFemales, called does or nannys, weigh 24 to 34 [kg](/wiki/Kilogram \"Kilogram\")\n(53 to 75 [lb](/wiki/Pound_\\(mass\\) \"Pound \\(mass\\)\")) and males, called bucks\nor billys, weigh 27 to 39 kg (60 to 86 lb). [Wither](/wiki/Withers \"Withers\")\nheight ranges from 41 to 58 cm (16 to 23 in). Castrated billys are called\nwethers. In the U.S. Pygmies only come in 7 breed standard approved colors,\nand can be categorized into caramel patterned,\n[agouti](/wiki/Agouti_\\(coloration\\) \"Agouti \\(coloration\\)\") patterned, and\nblack patterned. Within these categories, there are caramel with black\nmarkings, caramel with brown markings, brown agouti, grey agouti, black\nagouti, black with white markings, and solid black. The faulting matrix allows\nfor faulting random white markings from moderate to very serious and these\nanimals will be judged accordingly. White belly bands are not considered\nrandom markings. The U.S. African Pygmy will also only have brown colored\neyes.[2][3]\n\n## Reproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pygmy_goat&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Reproduction\")]\n\nPygmy goats are [precocial](/wiki/Precocial \"Precocial\") and\n[polyestrous](/wiki/Polyestrous \"Polyestrous\") breeders; bearing one to four\nyoung every nine to 12 months after a five-month gestation period. Does are\nusually bred for the first time at about 18 to 24 months, although they may\nconceive as early as two months if care is not taken to separate them early\nfrom male kids. Breeding under age does often results in c-sections. Newborn\nkids will nurse almost immediately, begin eating grain and roughage within a\nweek, and are weaned by ten weeks of age.\n\nPolyestrous sexual behavior means that they experience heat and can be\nfreshened (made to come into milk production) year-round. If milking is a\npriority, a continuous supply of milk can be obtained by breeding two or more\npygmy does alternately. Some full-size dairy breeds are also noted for\npolyestrous sexual behavior.\n\n## Origin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pygmy_goat&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Origin\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Hand_Rearing_-\n_Pygmy_Goat.JPG/220px-Hand_Rearing_-\n_Pygmy_Goat.JPG)](/wiki/File:Hand_Rearing_-_Pygmy_Goat.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hand_Rearing_-_Pygmy_Goat.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nAgouti Pygmy Kid being bottle fed\n\nThe Pygmy goat was developed from the [west african dwarf\ngoat](/wiki/West_African_Dwarf_goat \"West African Dwarf goat\"), a\n[landrace](/wiki/Landrace \"Landrace\") of [Central](/wiki/Central_Africa\n\"Central Africa\") and [West Africa](/wiki/West_Africa \"West Africa\"), found\nmost commonly in the [Cameroon](/wiki/Cameroon \"Cameroon\") Valley. They were\ntaken to Europe primarily by the British during the [colonial\nera](/wiki/British_West_Africa \"British West Africa\"). They were later\nimported into the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") from\nEuropean [zoos](/wiki/Zoo \"Zoo\") in the 1950s for use in zoos as well as\nresearch animals. They were eventually acquired by private breeders and\nquickly gained popularity as pets and exhibition animals due to their good-\nnatured personalities, friendliness and hardy constitution. Today, they are\ncommon as back-yard pets and in [petting zoos](/wiki/Petting_zoo \"Petting\nzoo\").[4]\n\n## Housing and care[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pygmy_goat&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Housing and care\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/African_Pygmy_Goat_003.jpg/220px-\nAfrican_Pygmy_Goat_003.jpg)](/wiki/File:African_Pygmy_Goat_003.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:African_Pygmy_Goat_003.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGrey Agouti Pygmy Buck\n\nPygmy goats are adaptable to most climates. Their primary diet consists of\n[greens](/wiki/Grass \"Grass\") and [grains](/wiki/Grain \"Grain\"). They enjoy\nhaving items to jump on and may be able to leap onto small\n[vehicles](/wiki/Vehicle \"Vehicle\"). They are also in need of a shed and open\narea accessible at all times. They also need a companion, which doesn't\nnecessarily have to be its own [species](/wiki/Species \"Species\"). They are\n[prey](/wiki/Prey \"Prey\") animals and should therefore be sheltered in a\npredator-proof area -especially at night. Goats require fresh water at all\ntimes or they won't drink it. Pygmy goats are often affectionate if they are\ntreated with respect. They can also be trained, though it requires quite a bit\nof work. It is important to make sure pygmy goats are comfortable and warm\nduring the winter months.[5] Simple measures such as feeding pygmy goats\n[lukewarm](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lukewarm \"wikt:lukewarm\") water and\nlukewarm food, as well as ensuring their living quarters are free from drafts,\ncan make pygmy goats a lot happier during the winter.[6]\n\n## General\ninformation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pygmy_goat&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: General information\")]\n\n  * Scientific name: Capra aegagrus hircus[7]\n  * Average lifespan: 8–18 years\n  * Normal body temperature: 101.5-104 °F (39.1 - 40 °C)\n  * Normal pulse rate: 60-90 beats per minute (faster for kids)\n  * Normal respiration rate: 15-30 per minute\n  * [Rumen](/wiki/Rumen \"Rumen\") movement: 1-1.5 per minute\n  * Gestation period: 145–155 days (average 150 days)\n  * Heat ([oestrus](/wiki/Oestrus \"Oestrus\")) cycle: 18–24 days (average 21 days)\n  * Length of heat: 12–48 hours (average 1 day)\n  * Weaning age (recommended): 8–10 weeks\n  * Males sexually mature: 9–12 weeks\n  * Females onset of heat: 3–12 months*\n  * Dehorning (by veterinary surgeon): By 7 days\n  * [Castration](/wiki/Castration \"Castration\"): \n    * Using [elastrator](/wiki/Elastration \"Elastration\") ring: 8 weeks and older (recommended to limit risk of Urinary Calculi)[[1]](http://www.ansc.purdue.edu/SP/MG/Documents/SLIDES/Urinary%20calculi.pdf)\n    * Surgical method (by vet): No age limit\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pygmy_goat&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Colby, Brian, et al. _Dairy goats-breeding/feeding/management_.
