Its music was composed by\n[Ahmad G. Chagla](/wiki/Ahmed_Ghulamali_Chagla \"Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla\") in\n1949, preceding the lyrics, which were written by [Hafeez\nJullundhri](/wiki/Hafeez_Jullundhri \"Hafeez Jullundhri\") in 1952. It was\nofficially adopted as Pakistan's national anthem in August 1954[1] and was\nrecorded in the same year by eleven major singers of Pakistan including [Ahmad\nRushdi](/wiki/Ahmad_Rushdi \"Ahmad Rushdi\"), Kaukab Jahan, Rasheeda Begum,\nNajam Ara, Naseema Shaheen, Zawar Hussain, Akhtar Abbas, Ghulam Dastagir,\nAnwar Zaheer and Akhtar Wasi Ali.[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Music\n  * 3 Lyrics\n  * 4 Milestones\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Qaumi_Taranah&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nIn early 1948, _A. R. Ghani_ , a Muslim from\n[Transvaal](/wiki/Transvaal_Province \"Transvaal Province\"), [South\nAfrica](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\"), offered two prizes of five\nthousand [rupees](/wiki/Pakistani_rupee \"Pakistani rupee\") each for the poet\nand composer of a new national anthem for the newly independent state of\nPakistan. The prizes were announced through a government press advertisement\npublished in June 1948. In December 1948, the [Government of\nPakistan](/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan \"Government of Pakistan\") established\nthe National Anthem Committee (NAC) with the task of coming up with the\ncomposition and lyrics for the official national anthem of Pakistan. The NAC\nwas initially chaired by the Information Secretary, [Sheikh Muhammad\nIkram](/wiki/S._M._Ikram \"S. M. Ikram\"), and its members included several\npoliticians, poets and musicians, including [Abdur Rab\nNishtar](/wiki/Abdur_Rab_Nishtar \"Abdur Rab Nishtar\"), [Ahmad G.\nChagla](/wiki/Ahmed_Ghulamali_Chagla \"Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla\") and [Hafeez\nJullundhri](/wiki/Hafeez_Jullundhri \"Hafeez Jullundhri\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The NAC\nencountered early difficulties in finding suitable music and lyrics.\n\nWhen President [Sukarno](/wiki/Sukarno \"Sukarno\") of\n[Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia \"Indonesia\") became the first foreign head of\nstate to visit Pakistan on 30 January 1950, there was no Pakistani national\nanthem to be played. In 1950, the impending state visit of the [Shah of\nIran](/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi \"Mohammad Reza Pahlavi\") added urgency to\nthe matter and resulted in the Government of Pakistan asking the NAC to submit\nan anthem without further delay. The NAC Chairman, then Federal Minister for\nEducation, Fazlur Rahman, asked several poets and composers to write lyrics\nbut none of the submitted works were deemed suitable. The NAC also examined\nseveral different tunes and eventually selected the one presented by Ahmed G.\nChagla and submitted it for formal approval.[3] On 21 August 1949, the\n[Government of Pakistan](/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan \"Government of\nPakistan\") adopted Chagla’s tune for the national anthem.[4]\n\nThe anthem, without lyrics, was performed for the first time for a foreign\nhead of state on the state visit of the Shah of Iran to Pakistan in\n[Karachi](/wiki/Karachi \"Karachi\") on 1 March 1950 by a [Pakistan\nNavy](/wiki/Pakistan_Navy \"Pakistan Navy\") band.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIt was later played for [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan\n\"Prime Minister of Pakistan\") [Liaquat Ali Khan](/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan\n\"Liaquat Ali Khan\") during his official visit to the United States on 3 May\n1950. It was played before the NAC on 10 August 1950.[5] Official recognition\nto the national anthem, however, was not given until August 1954.[5] The NAC\ndistributed records of the composed tune amongst prominent poets, who\nresponded by writing and submitting several hundred songs for evaluation by\nthe NAC. Eventually, the lyrics written by Hafeez Jullundhri were approved and\nthe new national anthem was broadcast publicly for the first time on Radio\nPakistan on 13 August 1954, sung by Hafeez Jullundhri himself. Official\napproval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on 16\nAugust 1954. The composer, Ahmed G. Chagla, died in 1953, before the new\nnational anthem was officially adopted. In 1955, there was a performance of\nthe national anthem involving 11 major singers of Pakistan, including [Ahmad\nRushdi](/wiki/Ahmad_Rushdi \"Ahmad Rushdi\"), Kaukab Jahan, Rasheeda Begum,\nNajam Ara, Naseema Shaheen, Zawar Hussain, Akhtar Abbas, Ghulam Dastagir,\nAnwar Zaheer and Akhtar Wasi Ali.[6]\n\n## Music[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Qaumi_Taranah&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Music\")]\n\nThe Qaumi Taranah is a melodious and harmonious rendering of a three-stanza\ncomposition with a tune based on eastern music but arranged in such a manner\nthat it can be easily played by foreign bands.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe music, composed by the Pakistani musician and composer, Ahmad G. Chagla in\n1949, reflects his background in both eastern and western music. Twenty-one\nmusical instruments[4] and thirty-eight different tones[4] are used to play\nthe Qaumi Taranah,[7] the duration of which is 80 seconds.[1][4][8]\n\n## Lyrics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Qaumi_Taranah&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Lyrics\")]\n\nThe [Urdu](/wiki/Urdu \"Urdu\") lyrics, written by the Pakistani Urdu-language\npoet, Hafeez Jullundhri in 1952, have commonality with\n[Persian](/wiki/Persian_language \"Persian language\"), making them\nunderstandable in both languages.
