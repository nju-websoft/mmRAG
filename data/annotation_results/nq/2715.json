        "# WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe **WrestleMania Women 's Battle Royal**[1] is a [professional\nwrestling](/wiki/Professional_wrestling \"Professional wrestling\") [battle\nroyal](/wiki/Professional_wrestling_battle_royal \"Professional wrestling\nbattle royal\") held at [WrestleMania](/wiki/WrestleMania \"WrestleMania\") by\n[American](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") [professional wrestling\npromotion](/wiki/Professional_wrestling_promotion \"Professional wrestling\npromotion\") [WWE](/wiki/WWE \"WWE\"). The inaugural battle royal was held during\nthe [WrestleMania 34](/wiki/WrestleMania_34 \"WrestleMania 34\") pre-show. The\nwinner of the match receives the WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal Trophy.\n\nThe match was originally named **The Fabulous Moolah Memorial Battle Royal**\nin honor of [The Fabulous Moolah](/wiki/The_Fabulous_Moolah \"The Fabulous\nMoolah\") – a [WWE Hall of Famer](/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame \"WWE Hall of Fame\")\nbilled as a pioneer of women's wrestling. However, her name was removed from\nthe match after backlash from fans due to the controversy surrounding Moolah's\npast.\n\nThis is the female counterpart to the [André the Giant Memorial Battle\nRoyal](/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_the_Giant_Memorial_Battle_Royal \"André the Giant\nMemorial Battle Royal\"), which was introduced at [WrestleMania\nXXX](/wiki/WrestleMania_XXX \"WrestleMania XXX\").[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Winners\n  * 3 Name controversy\n  * 4 References\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=WrestleMania_Women%27s_Battle_Royal&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nOn the March 12, 2018, episode of _[Raw](/wiki/WWE_Raw \"WWE Raw\")_ , WWE\nestablished The Fabulous Moolah Memorial Battle Royal in honor of Moolah, and\nthat the first match would take place at [WrestleMania\n34](/wiki/WrestleMania_34 \"WrestleMania 34\") on April 8, with the winner\nreceiving The Fabulous Moolah Memorial Trophy (made in the likeness of\nMoolah).[3][4] After a controversy over their decision to honor Moolah, WWE\nchanged the name to the \"WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal\".[1] The trophy was\nsubsequently renamed, and redesigned as a simple golden cup with tassels atop\nthe trophy's base.[5] The inaugural match was won by\n[Naomi](/wiki/Naomi_\\(wrestler\\) \"Naomi \\(wrestler\\)\"), after she last\neliminated [Bayley](/wiki/Bayley_\\(wrestler\\) \"Bayley \\(wrestler\\)\").\n\n##\nWinners[[edit](/w/index.php?title=WrestleMania_Women%27s_Battle_Royal&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Winners\")]\n\nWinner | Date | Location | WrestleMania | Last eliminated  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n[Naomi](/wiki/Naomi_\\(wrestler\\) \"Naomi \\(wrestler\\)\") | 000000002018-04-08-0000April 8, 2018 | [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\"), [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\") | [34](/wiki/WrestleMania_34 \"WrestleMania 34\") | [Bayley](/wiki/Bayley_\\(wrestler\\) \"Bayley \\(wrestler\\)\")  \n  \n## Name\ncontroversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=WrestleMania_Women%27s_Battle_Royal&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Name controversy\")]\n\nMain article: [The Fabulous Moolah § Allegations of\nexploitation](/wiki/The_Fabulous_Moolah#Allegations_of_exploitation \"The\nFabulous Moolah\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/The_Fabulous_Moolah_circa_date_photograph.jpg/170px-\nThe_Fabulous_Moolah_circa_date_photograph.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Fabulous_Moolah_circa_date_photograph.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Fabulous_Moolah_circa_date_photograph.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[The Fabulous Moolah](/wiki/The_Fabulous_Moolah \"The Fabulous Moolah\"), c.\n2003\n\nThe decision to hold a battle royal in honor of The Fabulous Moolah drew fan\nrage.[6][7] Tufayel Ahmed of _[Newsweek](/wiki/Newsweek \"Newsweek\")_ wrote\nthat Moolah \"isn't quite the bastion of female empowerment she is proclaimed\nto be\", with \"years of allegations\" that she had \"monopolized women’s\nwrestling in North America\", taken a large percentage of other wrestlers' pay,\nand \"sexually exploited women under her mentorship\".[8] Jason Powell, from\n_Pro Wrestling Dot Net_ , criticized the tribute as it does not \"exactly mesh\nwith what WWE wants their women's division push to represent\".[9] David\nBixenspan of _[Deadspin](/wiki/Deadspin \"Deadspin\")_ pointed out that given\nMoolah's alleged abuses, fans were particularly turned off by WWE personnel\ndescribing Moolah as a \"trailblazer for women’s equality\". WWE also promoted\nMoolah as having \"challenged the gender norms of a once male-dominated sport\",\nbut Bixenspan described that Moolah, by wrestling and teaching her students an\n\"in-ring style low on athleticism and heavy on hair-pulling\", relegated\nwomen's wrestling to \"much more of a sideshow\" instead of a \"legitimate\nheadline attraction\" in the previous era.[10] [Mad Maxine](/wiki/Mad_Maxine\n\"Mad Maxine\"), a wrestler trained by Moolah, commented that Moolah was the\nmost \"monstrous\" person she had ever met, and that wrestling is \"about\ngenerating heat. And you can't draw more heat than naming a match for The\nFabulous Moolah.\"[11]\n\nOn March 12, a [Change.org](/wiki/Change.org \"Change.org\") petition appeared\nonline demanding WWE change the name of its upcoming Fabulous Moolah Memorial\nBattle Royal, nearing its 10,000 signature goal.[7][12] Initially, WWE reacted\nby disabling the comments section of their YouTube video that announced the\nMoolah battle royal.[13][14] Later, [Snickers](/wiki/Snickers \"Snickers\"), the\nprimary sponsor of WrestleMania 34, called the decision to honor Moolah\n\"unacceptable\" and said they were \"engaging with the WWE to express our\ndisappointment.\"[15] On March 14, WWE renamed the match \"WrestleMania Women's\nBattle Royal\", removing Moolah's name from the event.[7][1]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=WrestleMania_Women%27s_Battle_Royal&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Currier, Joseph (March 15, 2018).
