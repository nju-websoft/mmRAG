He won ten\n[NCAA](/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association \"National Collegiate\nAthletic Association\") national championships in a 12-year period, including a\nrun of seven in a row that shattered the previous record of only two\nconsecutive titles.[9][10] Within this period, his teams won a men's\nbasketball-record 88 consecutive games.\n\nPrior to Wooden's arrival, UCLA had only won two conference championships in\nthe previous 18 years. In his first season, Wooden guided a UCLA team that had\nfinished with a 12–13 record the previous year to a 22–7 record—then the most\nwins in a season in program history—and the [Pacific Coast\nConference](/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Conference \"Pacific Coast Conference\") (PCC)\nSouthern Division championship.[10][11] In his second season, Wooden led the\nBruins to a 24–7 record and the PCC championship. The Bruins would win the\ndivision title in each of the next two seasons and the conference title in the\nlatter season. Up to that time, UCLA had won only two division titles since\nthe PCC began divisional play, and it had not won a conference title of any\nkind since winning the [Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic\nConference](/wiki/Southern_California_Intercollegiate_Athletic_Conference\n\"Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference\") in 1927.\n\nIn 1955–56, Wooden guided the Bruins to their first undefeated PCC conference\ntitle and a 17-game winning streak that only came to an end in the 1956 NCAA\nTournament at the hands of a [University of San\nFrancisco](/wiki/University_of_San_Francisco \"University of San Francisco\")\nteam that featured [Bill Russell](/wiki/Bill_Russell \"Bill Russell\"). However,\nUCLA was unable to maintain this level of performance over the immediate\nensuing seasons, finding itself unable to return to the NCAA Tournament as the\n[Pete Newell](/wiki/Pete_Newell \"Pete Newell\")-coached\n[California](/wiki/California_Golden_Bears_men%27s_basketball \"California\nGolden Bears men's basketball\") teams took control of the conference at the\nend of the decade. Also hampering the fortunes of Wooden's team during that\ntime period was a probation imposed on all UCLA sports in the aftermath of a\n[scandal](/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Conference#The_crisis \"Pacific Coast\nConference\") involving illegal payments made to players on the school's\nfootball team, along with USC, Cal and Stanford, resulting in the dismantling\nof the PCC conference.[12]\n\nBy 1962 the probation was no longer in place and Wooden had returned the\nBruins to the top of their conference (now the [Pac-12\nConference](/wiki/Pac-12_Conference \"Pac-12 Conference\")). This time, however,\nthey would take the next step, and go on to unleash a run of dominance\nunparalleled in the history of college sports. A narrow loss due largely to a\ncontroversial foul call in the semifinal of the 1962 NCAA Tournament convinced\nWooden that his Bruins were ready to contend for national championships.[12]\nTwo seasons later, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place when\nassistant coach [Jerry Norman](/wiki/Jerry_Norman_\\(basketball\\) \"Jerry Norman\n\\(basketball\\)\") persuaded Wooden that the team's small-sized players and\nfast-paced offense would be complemented by the adoption of a zone press\ndefense.[12] The result was a dramatic increase in scoring, giving UCLA a\npowerhouse team led by [Walt Hazzard](/wiki/Walt_Hazzard \"Walt Hazzard\") and\n[Gail Goodrich](/wiki/Gail_Goodrich \"Gail Goodrich\") that went undefeated on\nits way to the school's first basketball national championship.\n\nWooden's team repeated as national champions the following season before the\nsquad fell briefly in 1966 when it finished second in the conference to\n[Oregon State](/wiki/Oregon_State \"Oregon State\"). UCLA was ineligible to play\nin the NCAA tournament that year because in those days only conference\nchampions went to the tournament. However, the Bruins' incarnation returned\nwith a vengeance in 1967 with the arrival of sophomore All-America and MVP\n[Lew Alcindor](/wiki/Lew_Alcindor \"Lew Alcindor\"). The team reclaimed not only\nthe conference title but the national crown with an undefeated season.\n\nIn January 1968, UCLA took its 47-game winning streak to the\n[Astrodome](/wiki/Astrodome \"Astrodome\") in [Houston](/wiki/Houston\n\"Houston\"), where Alcindor squared off against [Elvin Hayes](/wiki/Elvin_Hayes\n\"Elvin Hayes\") in the [Game of the\nCentury](/wiki/Game_of_the_Century_\\(college_basketball\\) \"Game of the Century\n\\(college basketball\\)\"), which was the nation's first nationally televised\nregular season college basketball game. Houston upset UCLA 71-69 behind Hayes'\n39 points. In a post-game interview, Wooden stated, \"We have to start over.\"\nThey did, and went undefeated the rest of the year, avenging Houston 101-69 in\nthe semi-final rematch of the NCAA tournament en route to the national\nchampionship. Hayes, who had been averaging 37.7 points per game, was held to\nonly 10 points. Wooden credited Norman for devising the diamond-and-one\ndefense that contained the Houston center.[13][14]\n\nThe emergence of the Bruins under Wooden vastly increased the program's\npopularity. Since 1932, the Bruins had played at the [Men's\nGym](/wiki/Men%27s_Gym \"Men's Gym\"). It normally seated 2,400, but had been\nlimited to 1,500 since 1955 by order of the city fire marshal. This forced\ngames to be moved to [Pan Pacific Auditorium](/wiki/Pan_Pacific_Auditorium\n\"Pan Pacific Auditorium\"), the [Los Angeles Memorial Sports\nArena](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Sports_Arena \"Los Angeles Memorial Sports\nArena\") and other venues around Los Angeles when larger crowds were\nexpected—an increasing inconvenience since the Bruins' first national title.\nAt Wooden's urging, a much larger on-campus facility was built in time for the\n1965–66 season, the nearly 13,000 seat [Pauley Pavilion](/wiki/Pauley_Pavilion\n\"Pauley Pavilion\"), .\n\nWooden coached his final game in Pauley Pavilion on March 1, 1975, when UCLA\ntrounced [Stanford](/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal_men%27s_basketball \"Stanford\nCardinal men's basketball\") 93–59. Four weeks later, following a 75–74\novertime victory over\n[Louisville](/wiki/Louisville_Cardinals_men%27s_basketball \"Louisville\nCardinals men's basketball\") in the 1975 NCAA Tournament semifinal game,\nWooden announced that he would retire at age 64 immediately after the\nchampionship game.[15] His legendary coaching career concluded triumphantly,\nas his team responded with a win over\n[Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men%27s_basketball \"Kentucky Wildcats men's\nbasketball\") to claim Wooden's first career coaching victory over the Wildcats\nand his unprecedented 10th national championship in a twelve-year span.\n\nDuring his tenure with the Bruins, Wooden became known as the \"Wizard of\n[Westwood](/wiki/Westwood,_Los_Angeles \"Westwood, Los Angeles\")\", although he\npersonally disdained the nickname. He gained lasting fame at UCLA by winning\n620 games in 27 seasons and 10 NCAA titles during his last 12 seasons, which\nincluded seven in a row from 1967 to 1973.[9] His UCLA teams also had a then-\nrecord winning streak of 88 games[16][17] and four perfect 30–0 seasons.[9]\nThey also won 38 straight games in NCAA Tournaments[9] and 98 straight home\ngame wins at [Pauley Pavilion](/wiki/Pauley_Pavilion \"Pauley Pavilion\").\nWooden was named NCAA College Basketball's \"Coach of the Year\" in 1964, 1967,\n1969, 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973. In 1967, he was named the [Henry Iba\nAward](/wiki/Henry_Iba_Award \"Henry Iba Award\") USBWA College Basketball Coach\nof the Year. In 1972, he shared _[Sports Illustrated](/wiki/Sports_Illustrated\n\"Sports Illustrated\")_ magazine's \"[Sportsman of the\nYear](/wiki/Sportsman_of_the_Year \"Sportsman of the Year\")\" award with [Billie\nJean King](/wiki/Billie_Jean_King \"Billie Jean King\").

However, that runner-up finish was later\nvacated by the NCAA after two players were found to be ineligible.

He had recruited [Earvin \"Magic\"\nJohnson](/wiki/Magic_Johnson \"Magic Johnson\") to come play at UCLA, but then\ntold Johnson to hold off on a visit as he was more interested in [Albert\nKing](/wiki/Albert_King_\\(basketball\\) \"Albert King \\(basketball\\)\").[20]\nNeither played for UCLA.\n\nIn 1984, [Walt Hazzard](/wiki/Walt_Hazzard \"Walt Hazzard\") was named the UCLA\nbasketball coach twenty years after winning the national championship as a\nplayer. He coached for four seasons, winning 77 out of 125 games.

The 1986–1987 UCLA Bruin basketball team won both the\n[Pac-10](/wiki/Pacific-10_Conference_men%27s_basketball \"Pacific-10 Conference\nmen's basketball\") regular season championship as well as the inaugural\n[Pacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball\nTournament](/wiki/Pacific-10_Conference_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament\n\"Pacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament\").\n\n### The Jim Harrick\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: The Jim Harrick era\")]\n\nIn 1988, [Jim Harrick](/wiki/Jim_Harrick \"Jim Harrick\") returned to UCLA (he\nhad spent two years as an assistant coach from 1978 to 1979) to assume head\ncoaching duties after the firing of [Walt Hazzard](/wiki/Walt_Hazzard \"Walt\nHazzard\"). During the recruiting period before his first season, he recruited\n[Don MacLean](/wiki/Don_MacLean_\\(basketball\\) \"Don MacLean \\(basketball\\)\"),\nthe most significant recruit to commit to UCLA in several years. McLean's\narrival helped start a revival of the basketball program. Within four years,\nthe Bruins were in the Elite Eight--\"officially\" their deepest advance in the\ntournament in 13 years, and only the second time they had gone that far since\nWooden's departure.\n\nDuring the [1994–1995\nseason](/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball_team \"1994–95\nUCLA Bruins men's basketball team\"), he led UCLA to a 31-2 record (a loss to\nCalifornia was subsequently forfeited to the Bruins) and the school's\n[eleventh national\nchampionship](/wiki/1995_NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament \"1995\nNCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament\"), its first since the [1974–75\nseason](/wiki/1974%E2%80%9375_UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball_team \"1974–75\nUCLA Bruins men's basketball team\"). The 31 wins would stand as a school\nrecord until the 2005–06 season. In 1996, Harrick's Bruins were upset in the\nfirst round by [Princeton](/wiki/Princeton_Tigers \"Princeton Tigers\"). Shortly\nbefore the 1996 season, UCLA fired Harrick for lying about who attended a\nrecruiting dinner. At the time, he was the second-winningest coach in school\nhistory.\n\n### The Steve Lavin\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: The Steve Lavin era\")]\n\nOn the departure of assistants [Mark Gottfried](/wiki/Mark_Gottfried \"Mark\nGottfried\") and [Lorenzo Romar](/wiki/Lorenzo_Romar \"Lorenzo Romar\") for head\ncoaching jobs shortly after the 1995 NCAA Championship season, Lavin, as the\nassistant with the longest tenure at UCLA, was selected as interim head coach.\n\nLater that season on February 11, 1997, with the Bruins tied for first place\nin the Pac-10 with an 8–3 record, UCLA removed the \"interim\" tag from Lavin's\ntitle and formally named him as its 11th head coach. The Bruins then won their\nnext 11 games en route to the Pac-10 title, before being eliminated by the\n[Minnesota Gophers](/wiki/Minnesota_Golden_Gophers_men%27s_basketball\n\"Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball\") in the NCAA Midwest Regional\nFinal. In seven seasons as head coach Lavin's record was 12–4 in games\ninvolving overtime. Additionally Lavin's Bruins had a 10–4 record against the\nrival [USC Trojans](/wiki/USC_Trojans_men%27s_basketball \"USC Trojans men's\nbasketball\"). During the period 1997–2002, Lavin's Bruins compiled nine\nconsecutive overtime victories. These included victories over\n[Arizona](/wiki/Arizona \"Arizona\"), [Cincinnati](/wiki/Cincinnati\n\"Cincinnati\") (2002 NCAA second round double overtime victory over No. 1 West\nRegion seed), [Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky \"Kentucky\"), and\n[Stanford](/wiki/Stanford \"Stanford\") (then ranked No 1). The Stanford win was\nsealed by a last second jumper by star sophomore guard [JaRon\nRush](/wiki/JaRon_Rush \"JaRon Rush\").\n\nAt UCLA from 1996 to 2003, Lavin compiled a record of 145–78. As both an\nassistant and head coach, Lavin participated in 13 consecutive NCAA tournament\nappearances (1990–2002), while working at Purdue and UCLA. During Lavin's\ntenure as a head coach, he was one of only two coaches in the country to lead\nhis team to five NCAA \"Sweet 16s\" in six years (1997, 1998, 2000–2002), the\nother coach being [Duke's](/wiki/Duke_University \"Duke University\") [Mike\nKrzyzewski](/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski \"Mike Krzyzewski\"). Lavin guided UCLA to six\nconsecutive seasons of 20 or more wins, as well as six consecutive NCAA\ntournament appearances.[21]\n\nLavin signed seven McDonald's High School All-Americans. Seven of Lavin's\nformer Bruin recruits became roster members of NBA teams: [Trevor\nAriza](/wiki/Trevor_Ariza \"Trevor Ariza\"), [Matt Barnes](/wiki/Matt_Barnes\n\"Matt Barnes\"), [Baron Davis](/wiki/Baron_Davis \"Baron Davis\"), [Dan\nGadzuric](/wiki/Dan_Gadzuric \"Dan Gadzuric\"), [Ryan\nHollins](/wiki/Ryan_Hollins \"Ryan Hollins\"), [Jason Kapono](/wiki/Jason_Kapono\n\"Jason Kapono\"), and [Earl Watson](/wiki/Earl_Watson \"Earl Watson\").\n\nDuring Lavin's tenure as head coach, the Bruins qualified for six consecutive\nNCAA Tournaments (1997–2002). Lavin's record in the first and second rounds of\nthe NCAA tournament is 10–1. His winning percentage (90.9%) in the first two\nrounds is second only to Dean Smith in NCAA Tournament history. However, Lavin\nalso coached the Bruins to their only loss in an NCAA tournament game played\nin the State of California (a 2002 loss to Missouri in San Jose).\n\nIn seven seasons as head coach Lavin's record was 12–4 in games involving\novertime. The Bruins defeated the No. 1 team in the country in four\nconsecutive collegiate seasons: Stanford in 2000 and 2001, Kansas in 2002 and\nArizona in 2003.\n\nIn March 2003, following UCLA's first losing season (10–19) in 55 years, Lavin\nwas fired.\n\nDespite some success under the watch of Steve Lavin, the program wanted to\nregain its position in the college basketball upper echelon. Even the success\nin the NCAA tournament belied the fact that UCLA had earned no better than a\nnumber 4 seed with the exception of the 1997 season. The\n[2002–03](/wiki/2002%E2%80%9303_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_season\n\"2002–03 NCAA Division I men's basketball season\") season turned out to be the\nback-breaker for Lavin as the Bruins stumbled to a 10–19 record and a 6–12\nrecord in the conference. It was the first losing season for UCLA in over five\ndecades. Lavin was dismissed following the season.\n\n### Ben Howland era\n(2003–2013)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Ben Howland era \\(2003–2013\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Russell_Westbrook_guarding_OJ_Mayo_cropped.jpg/220px-\nRussell_Westbrook_guarding_OJ_Mayo_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:Russell_Westbrook_guarding_OJ_Mayo_cropped.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Russell_Westbrook_guarding_OJ_Mayo_cropped.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Russell Westbrook](/wiki/Russell_Westbrook \"Russell Westbrook\") (left) and\n[Kevin Love](/wiki/Kevin_Love \"Kevin Love\") defend against\n[USC](/wiki/USC_Trojans_men%27s_basketball \"USC Trojans men's basketball\")\n\nUCLA looked to find a coach that could move the Bruins back to the elite ranks\nof the Pac-10 and the country. Howland's success at the University of\nPittsburgh and his southern California roots made him an attractive candidate.\nIn 2003, he left Pitt and accepted the head coaching duties at UCLA.[22]\n\nHowland remedied this disappointment in his recruiting efforts. Howland\nproduced a top tier recruiting class from athletes in southern California that\nfit his Big East style. Behind Lavin hold-over Dijon Thompson and Howland\nrecruits [Jordan Farmar](/wiki/Jordan_Farmar \"Jordan Farmar\") and [Arron\nAfflalo](/wiki/Arron_Afflalo \"Arron Afflalo\"), UCLA produced a winning season\nfor the first time in three years and returned to the tournament, where they\nlost in the first round.\n\nStarting the [2005–06\nseason](/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_season\n\"2005–06 NCAA Division I men's basketball season\") with the majority of the\nroster made over in Howland's image and with the Lavin hold-overs (e.g., [Ryan\nHollins](/wiki/Ryan_Hollins \"Ryan Hollins\") and [Cedric\nBozeman](/wiki/Cedric_Bozeman \"Cedric Bozeman\")), the Bruins produced an\nexcellent campaign. They finished the regular season 24–6, winning the Pac-10\nConference title. They then roared through the [Pac-10\ntournament](/wiki/2006_Pacific-10_Conference_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament\n\"2006 Pacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament\"), winning each game\nby double digits en route to only the second Pac-10 tournament championship in\nschool history. The momentum continued into the NCAA tournament as the second-\nseeded Bruins defeated [Gonzaga](/wiki/Gonzaga_Bulldogs_men%27s_basketball\n\"Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball\") in the Sweet Sixteen. They then upset\ntop-seeded Memphis to reach the school's first Final Four in 11 years. The run\nended in the championship game against\n[Florida](/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_Florida_Gators_men%27s_basketball_team\n\"2005–06 Florida Gators men's basketball team\"), whose imposing front-line\nproved to be a matchup problem for the Bruins.\n\nHowland continued his success at UCLA the following year. The\n[Bruins](/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball_team \"2006–07\nUCLA Bruins men's basketball team\") finished undefeated at home for the first\ntime in 22 years, winning the Pac-10 conference title. However they lost in\ntheir first [Pac-10 tournament\ngame](/wiki/2007_Pacific-10_Conference_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament \"2007\nPacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament\") and were seeded second in\nthe NCAA Tournament West Region. After a close second-round win over\n[Indiana](/wiki/Indiana_Hoosiers_men%27s_basketball \"Indiana Hoosiers men's\nbasketball\"), Howland led the Bruins to a win over his former team,\n[Pitt](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers_men%27s_basketball \"Pittsburgh Panthers men's\nbasketball\") in the Sweet Sixteen. The Bruins then again upset the top seed in\nthe West Region,\n[Kansas](/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_Kansas_Jayhawks_men%27s_basketball_team\n\"2006–07 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team\"), and reached the second of\nUCLA's first consecutive Final Fours since the [John Wooden](/wiki/John_Wooden\n\"John Wooden\") era, only to lose again to\n[Florida](/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_Florida_Gators_men%27s_basketball_team\n\"2006–07 Florida Gators men's basketball team\") in the national semifinal.\n\nAt the start of the [2007–08\nseason](/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_season\n\"2007–08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season\"), expectations for\n[UCLA](/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball_team \"2007–08 UCLA\nBruins men's basketball team\") were the highest ever with the arrival of\n[Kevin Love](/wiki/Kevin_Love \"Kevin Love\"), one of the best low-post\nprospects in the high school class of 2007.[23] Combined with the emergence of\n[Russell Westbrook](/wiki/Russell_Westbrook \"Russell Westbrook\") and [Darren\nCollison](/wiki/Darren_Collison \"Darren Collison\") in the back-court, the\nBruins won their 3rd consecutive Pac-10 conference title, and their second\n[Pac-10 tournament\ntitle](/wiki/2008_Pacific-10_Conference_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament \"2008\nPacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament\") in three years. They\nreceived their first #1 seed in the NCAA tournament since 1995, and once again\nreached the Final Four, where they faced another top seed, the [Memphis\nTigers](/wiki/Memphis_Tigers_men%27s_basketball \"Memphis Tigers men's\nbasketball\"). Memphis got the better of the Bruins, who returned to Westwood\nwithout a championship once again.\n\nHowever, the Bruins program under Howland began to struggle in subsequent\nseasons. After 2008, UCLA did not advance past the first weekend of the NCAA\ntourney, and did not qualify for the tournament in\n[2010](/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball_team \"2009–10 UCLA\nBruins men's basketball team\") and\n[2012](/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball_team \"2011–12 UCLA\nBruins men's basketball team\").[24] With a 77-73 victory over\n[Penn](/wiki/Penn_Quakers_men%27s_basketball \"Penn Quakers men's basketball\")\non December 10, 2011; Howland passed [Jim Harrick](/wiki/Jim_Harrick \"Jim\nHarrick\") for second on UCLA's all-time wins list behind [John\nWooden](/wiki/John_Wooden \"John Wooden\"). Nonetheless, questions about how\nHowland was running the program began to come into focus. In February 2012, a\n_[Sports Illustrated](/wiki/Sports_Illustrated \"Sports Illustrated\")_ article\nportrayed UCLA player [Reeves Nelson](/wiki/Reeves_Nelson \"Reeves Nelson\") as\na bully on and off the court, who at times intentionally tried to injure his\nteammates. According to the article, Howland looked the other way and did not\ndiscipline Nelson for over two years.[25][26] From 2008—the Bruins last Final\nFour appearance—through 2012, at least 11 players left the UCLA program.[27]\n\nAlthough the 2012–2013 Bruins won the Pac-12 regular season championship, they\nquickly bowed out in the first round of the NCAA tournament. On March 25,\n2013, three days after being eliminated by 11th seed Minnesota, UCLA fired\nHowland.[28][29]\n\n### Steve Alford era\n(2013–present)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Steve Alford era \\(2013–present\\)\")]\n\nOn March 30, 2013, Alford signed a seven-year, $18.2-million contract to\nbecome the head coach of UCLA, replacing the fired [Ben\nHowland](/wiki/Ben_Howland \"Ben Howland\").[30] In his first year as head coach\nAlford led UCLA to a Pac-12 tournament championship, a feat not accomplished\nsince 2008. The team later went on to the \"Sweet Sixteen\" of the [NCAA\nDivision I Men's Basketball\nTournament](/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament \"NCAA Division\nI Men's Basketball Tournament\") as a 4 seed in the South regional before\nlosing to the 1 seed Florida.\n\nIn his second year, the team was controversially chosen to participate in the\n[2015 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball\nTournament](/wiki/2015_NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament \"2015\nNCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament\") as an 11 seed in the South\nRegion, where they upset the 6 seed\n[SMU](/wiki/Southern_Methodist_Mustangs_men%27s_basketball \"Southern Methodist\nMustangs men's basketball\") on a game-winning goaltending call. The Bruins\nwent on to defeat the [University of Alabama at Birmingham\nBlazers](/wiki/UAB_Blazers_men%27s_basketball \"UAB Blazers men's basketball\")\nbefore losing to rival [Gonzaga](/wiki/Gonzaga_Bulldogs_men%27s_basketball\n\"Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball\") in the \"Sweet Sixteen.\"\n\nAfter a disappointing third season in which UCLA suffered their fourth losing\nrecord since 1948, the team rebounded in the following season, going 31-5\nbefore falling to [Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men%27s_basketball\n\"Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball\"), once again in the \"Sweet Sixteen.\"\nFreshman point guard [Lonzo Ball](/wiki/Lonzo_Ball \"Lonzo Ball\"), as well as\nthe program in general, garnered national media attention for the outspoken\nbehavior of his father [LaVar Ball](/wiki/LaVar_Ball \"LaVar\nBall\").[31][32][33]\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2017-18 season, the team travelled to China to\nparticipate in the annual Pac-12 China Game. On November 6 in\n[Hangzhou](/wiki/Hangzhou \"Hangzhou\"), during a block of free time allotted to\nthe players, freshmen [LiAngelo Ball](/wiki/LiAngelo_Ball \"LiAngelo Ball\"),\nCody Riley and Jalen Hill shoplifted sunglasses from a [Louis\nVuitton](/wiki/Louis_Vuitton \"Louis Vuitton\") department store. They were\nplaced under house arrest by local police the next day and required to hand\nover their passports.[34] The controversy garnered immense attention due to\nthe reputation of LiAngelo as a member of the [Ball\nfamily](/wiki/Ball_in_the_Family \"Ball in the Family\") and received\nsignificant media coverage. President [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump\n\"Donald Trump\"), who was concurrently visiting China, reportedly asked General\nSecretary [Xi Jinping](/wiki/Xi_Jinping \"Xi Jinping\") to pardon the three men,\nand they were released back to the United States shortly after, although\nBall's family questioned if the President's request was a direct reason for\nthe release.[35] The players were placed on suspension from basketball\nactivities, and were eventually suspended for the entirety of the season on\nDecember 22nd.[36] Believing the suspension to have been unearned, LaVar Ball\npreemptively withdrew LiAngelo from UCLA and had him sign with an agent,\nmaking him ineligible for further NCAA competition.[37]\n\nUCLA finished the regular season in a three-way tie for third (tied with Utah\nand Stanford) in the Pac-12 (21-10, 11-7), and junior guard [Aaron\nHoliday](/wiki/Aaron_Holiday \"Aaron Holiday\") was named to the First-team\n[All-Pac-12](/wiki/List_of_All-Pac-12_Conference_men%27s_basketball_teams\n\"List of All-Pac-12 Conference men's basketball teams\") and the Pac-12 All\nDefensive Team, the first player to do so in the Alford era.[38]\n\n## Season-by-season\nresults[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Season-by-season results\")]\n\nMain article: [List of UCLA Bruins men's basketball\nseasons](/wiki/List_of_UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball_seasons \"List of UCLA\nBruins men's basketball seasons\")\n\n##\nFacilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Facilities\")]\n\nThe men's basketball team played in the 2,400 seat [Men's\nGym](/wiki/Men%27s_Gym \"Men's Gym\") from 1932 to 1965.
