        "# Magic in _Harry Potter_\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\nIn [J. K. Rowling](/wiki/J._K._Rowling \"J. K. Rowling\")'s _[Harry\nPotter](/wiki/Harry_Potter \"Harry Potter\")_ series,\n[magic](/wiki/Magic_in_fiction \"Magic in fiction\") is depicted as a\nsupernatural force that can be used to override the usual [laws of\nnature](/wiki/Physical_law \"Physical law\"). Many fictional [magical\ncreatures](/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter \"Magical creatures in Harry\nPotter\") exist in the series, while ordinary creatures sometimes exhibit new\nmagical properties in the novel's world.\n[Objects](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter \"Magical objects in Harry\nPotter\"), too, can be enhanced or imbued with magical property. The small\npercentage of humans who are able to perform magic are referred to as witches\nand wizards, in contrast to the non-magical [muggles](/wiki/Muggle \"Muggle\")\n(British English) or No-Majs (American English).\n\nIn humans, magic or the lack thereof is an inborn attribute. It is inherited,\ncarried on \"dominant resilient genes\".[1] Magic is the norm for the children\nof magical couples and less common in those of muggles. Exceptions exist:\nthose unable to do magic who are born to magical parents are known as\n[squibs](/wiki/Blood_purity_\\(Harry_Potter\\)#Squibs \"Blood purity \\(Harry\nPotter\\)\"), whereas a witch or wizard born to muggle parents is known as a\n[muggle-born](/wiki/Blood_purity_\\(Harry_Potter\\)#Muggle-born \"Blood purity\n\\(Harry Potter\\)\"), or by the [derogatory term](/wiki/Derogatory_term\n\"Derogatory term\") \"mudblood\". While muggle-borns are quite common, squibs are\nextremely rare.\n\nRowling based many magical elements of the _Harry Potter_ universe on real-\nworld mythology and magic. She has described this as \"a way of giving texture\nto the world\".[2] The books present the idea that the Muggle interpretation of\nthese stories is a distorted version of what goes on in the wizarding world.\n\nThe magic of _Harry Potter_ became the subject of a 2017 [British\nLibrary](/wiki/British_Library \"British Library\") exhibition and accompanying\ndocumentary. The exhibition, entitled _Harry Potter: A History of Magic_ , is\nthe first at the British Library to feature a living author as its subject.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Using magic\n    * 1.1 Spellcasting\n  * 2 The limits of magic\n    * 2.1 Death\n    * 2.2 Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration\n    * 2.3 Emotion\n  * 3 Magical abilities\n    * 3.1 Animagi\n    * 3.2 Metamorphmagi\n    * 3.3 Parseltongue\n    * 3.4 Seers\n    * 3.5 Legilimency and Occlumency\n    * 3.6 Apparition and Disapparition\n    * 3.7 Other teleportation\n    * 3.8 Veela charm\n    * 3.9 Magical resistance\n  * 4 Subjects at Hogwarts\n    * 4.1 Transfiguration\n    * 4.2 Defence Against the Dark Arts\n    * 4.3 Charms\n    * 4.4 Potions\n    * 4.5 Astronomy\n    * 4.6 History of Magic\n    * 4.7 Herbology\n    * 4.8 Arithmancy\n    * 4.9 Study of Ancient Runes\n    * 4.10 Divination\n    * 4.11 Care of Magical Creatures\n    * 4.12 Muggle Studies\n    * 4.13 Alchemy\n    * 4.14 Flying\n    * 4.15 Apparition\n  * 5 Spell-like effects\n    * 5.1 Unbreakable Vow\n    * 5.2 Priori Incantatem\n  * 6 Dark Arts\n    * 6.1 Unforgivable Curses\n    * 6.2 Dark Mark\n    * 6.3 Inferius\n    * 6.4 Horcrux\n  * 7 Portraits\n    * 7.1 Portraits in the Headmaster's office\n    * 7.2 The Fat Lady\n    * 7.3 Photographs\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 Further reading\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Using\nmagic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Using magic\")]\n\nWitches and wizards need training to learn how to control their magic. With\nyoung and untrained children, magic will manifest itself subconsciously in\nmoments of strong apprehension, fear, anger and sadness.[4] For example,\n[Harry Potter](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(character\\) \"Harry Potter \\(character\\)\")\nonce made his hair grow back after a bad haircut, set a boa constrictor on his\ncousin [Dudley](/wiki/Dursley_family#Dudley_Dursley \"Dursley family\") at the\nLondon Zoo, and made [Aunt Marge](/wiki/Dursley_family#Marjorie_Dursley\n\"Dursley family\") inflate to an enormous size. While this reaction is usually\nuncontrollable, as an untrained child, [Lord Voldemort](/wiki/Lord_Voldemort\n\"Lord Voldemort\") was able to make things move without touching them, make\nanimals do what he wanted without training them, make \"bad things happen to\npeople\" who annoyed him, or make them hurt if he wanted to.[5] In addition,\n[Lily Potter](/wiki/Lily_Potter \"Lily Potter\") was able to guide and control\nthe blooming of a flower by wanting to.\n\nAlmost all magic is done with the use of a\n[wand](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Wand \"Magical objects in Harry\nPotter\"). On the subject of wandless magic, Rowling says:[6]\n\n“  | You can do unfocused and uncontrolled magic without a wand (for instance when Harry blows up Aunt Marge) but to do really good spells, yes, you need a wand.  | ”   \n---|---|---  \n  \nA wizard or witch is only at their best when using their own wand. When using\nanother's wand, one's spells are not as strong as they normally would\nbe.[[HP1]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone \"Harry Potter and\nthe Philosopher's Stone\")\n\nWithin the books, technical details of magic are obscure. Of Harry's lessons,\nonly those involving [magical creatures](/wiki/Magical_beasts_\\(Harry_Potter\\)\n\"Magical beasts \\(Harry Potter\\)\"), [potions](/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter\n\"Potions in Harry Potter\") or divination are given in any detail.\n\n[Severus Snape](/wiki/Severus_Snape \"Severus Snape\") once told [Harry\nPotter](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(character\\) \"Harry Potter \\(character\\)\") that\n\"Time and space matter in magic\" during Harry's first Occlumency lesson in\n_Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_ and [Albus\nDumbledore](/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore \"Albus Dumbledore\") told Harry after\nfinding the magically concealed boat to reach the locket\n[Horcrux](/wiki/Horcrux \"Horcrux\") that \"Magic always leaves traces, sometimes\nvery distinctive traces.\"[[HP6]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince\n\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\")\n\n###\nSpellcasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Spellcasting\")]\n\n[Spells](/wiki/Spell_\\(paranormal\\) \"Spell \\(paranormal\\)\") are the every-\npurpose tools of a wizard or witch; short bursts of magic used to accomplish\nsingle specialised tasks such as opening locks or creating fire. Typically\ncasting requires an [incantation](/wiki/Incantation \"Incantation\"), most often\nin a modified form of [Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") (see [Dog\nLatin](/wiki/Dog_Latin \"Dog Latin\")), and gesturing with a\n[wand](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Wand \"Magical objects in Harry\nPotter\"). However, Rowling has revealed that particularly talented wizards can\ncast spells without the aid of wand, although magic produced with one is\ngenerally more precise and powerful.[7] Spells can also be cast non-verbally,\nbut with a magical wand. This special technique is taught in the sixth year of\nstudy at Hogwarts and requires the caster to concentrate on the incantation.\nSome spells (e.g. _Levicorpus_) are apparently designed to be used non-\nverbally. While most magic shown in the books requires the caster to use their\nvoice, some do not (and this may depend on the witch or wizard). Dumbledore\nhas been known to do impressive feats of magic without speaking, such as\n[conjuring](/wiki/Conjuring \"Conjuring\") enough squashy purple sleeping bags\nto accommodate the entire student\npopulation[[HP3]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban \"Harry Potter\nand the Prisoner of Azkaban\") or during his duel with Voldemort towards the\nend of _Order of the Phoenix_.\n\nIt is possible to use a wand without holding it. In _Order of the Phoenix_ ,\nHarry himself performs _Lumos_ to light his wand when it is lying on the\nground somewhere near\nhim.[[HP5]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix \"Harry Potter and\nthe Order of the Phoenix\") Additionally, [Animagi](/wiki/Animagus \"Animagus\")\nand [Metamorphmagi](/wiki/Metamorphmagus \"Metamorphmagus\") do not need wands\nto undergo their transformations.\n\nSpells are divided into rough categories, such as\n\"[charms](/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Charms \"Magic in Harry Potter\")\",\n\"[curses](/wiki/Curse \"Curse\")\", \"hexes\", or \"[jinxes](/wiki/Jinx \"Jinx\")\".\nAlthough offensive and potentially dangerous curses exist in number, three are\nconsidered usable only for great evil, which earns them the special\nclassification of \"Unforgivable Curses\".\n\n## The limits of\nmagic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: The limits of magic\")]\n\nBefore publishing the first _Harry Potter_ novel, Rowling spent five years\nestablishing the limitations of magic—determining what it could and could not\ndo. \"The most important thing to decide when you're creating a fantasy world,\"\nshe said in 2000, \"is what the characters _can 't_ do.\" For instance, while it\nis possible to conjure things out of thin air, it is far more tricky to create\nsomething that fits an exact specification rather than a general one;\nmoreover, any objects so conjured tend not to last.[8]\n\n###\nDeath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Death\")]\n\nRowling has described death as the most important theme in the books.[9]\nConsequently, as Dumbledore states in _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_ ,\nthere is no spell that can truly bring the dead back to life. While corpses\ncan be transformed into obedient Inferi on a living wizard's command, they are\nlittle more than [zombies](/wiki/Zombies \"Zombies\") with no soul or will of\ntheir own. However, there are some methods of communicating with the dead,\nthough with limited results. For example, all Hogwarts headmasters appear in a\n[portrait](/wiki/Magical_portrait_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Magical portrait \\(Harry\nPotter\\)\") when they die, allowing consultation by future generations. It is\nalso possible through the rare Priori Incantatem effect to converse with\nghost-like \"shadows\" of magically murdered people. The [Resurrection\nStone](/wiki/Deathly_Hallows_\\(objects\\)#Resurrection_Stone \"Deathly Hallows\n\\(objects\\)\") also allows one to talk to the dead, but those brought back by\nthe Stone are not corporeal, nor do they wish to be disturbed from their\npeaceful rest. Throughout the series, this limit is continually mentioned, and\nwizards try to transcend it at their own peril.\n\nLikewise, it is not possible to make oneself immortal unless one makes use of\nan object of great power to sustain life, such as the [Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Philosopher's_Stone \"Magical\nobjects in Harry Potter\") or [horcruxes](/wiki/Horcrux \"Horcrux\"). If one were\nto possess the three [Deathly Hallows](/wiki/Deathly_Hallows_\\(objects\\)\n\"Deathly Hallows \\(objects\\)\"), it is fabled that they would possess the tools\nto become the \"master of death\". However, it is hinted that to be a true\n\"master of death\" is to be willing to accept that death is inevitable. Other\nmethods of extending life include drinking unicorn blood, which will keep a\nperson alive even if death is imminent, but at the terrible price of being\ncursed forever. Being magical can contribute to one's\n[longevity](/wiki/Longevity \"Longevity\"), as there are several characters in\nthe series who are unusually long-lived (such as [Griselda\nMarchbanks](/wiki/Griselda_Marchbanks \"Griselda Marchbanks\"), who was an\ninvigilator during Albus Dumbledore's O.W.L examinations). It is revealed by\n[Nearly Headless Nick](/wiki/Nearly_Headless_Nick \"Nearly Headless Nick\") in\nthe fifth book that all witches and wizards have the choice of becoming\n[ghosts](/wiki/Ghosts_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Ghosts \\(Harry Potter\\)\") upon dying;\nhowever, it is described as \"a pale imitation of life\". Snape states that a\nghost is merely \"the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth\".\n\nDeath is studied at the [Department of\nMysteries](/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries \"Department of Mysteries\") in a\nchamber containing an enigmatic veil, which Rowling has described as \"the\ndivide between life and death\". With regard to what is on the other side, she\nelaborated: \"Do I believe you go on? Yes, I do believe you go on. I do believe\nin an afterlife, although I'm absolutely doubt-ridden and always have been but\nthere you are.\"[10] Sirius falls through this veil in _Order of the Phoenix_\nafter he is hit with a curse from Bellatrix.\n\n### Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental\nTransfiguration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental\nTransfiguration\")]\n\nThe **Principal Exceptions to Gamp 's Law of Elemental Transfiguration** is a\nmagical theory mentioned by Hermione and later repeated by Ron in the final\nbook. She explains that food is one of these: witches or wizards can cook and\nprepare food using magic, and even multiply it, but not create it out of\nnothing. There are numerous examples in the series of food _appearing_ to have\nbeen conjured from nothing, such as the sudden materialisation of ingredients\nin the pots of Molly Weasley's kitchen and when Professor McGonagall creates a\nself-refilling plate of sandwiches for Harry and Ron in _[Chamber of\nSecrets](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_The_Chamber_of_Secrets \"Harry Potter and The\nChamber of Secrets\")_. In all cases, these events can be reasonably explained\nas food either being multiplied or transported from elsewhere. One example of\nthe latter is banqueting at Hogwarts—the food is prepared by elves in the\nkitchens and laid onto four replica tables, directly below the actual house\ntables in the Great Hall. The food is then magically transported to the\ntables.\n\nThis is the only exception mentioned explicitly in the series. However,\nRowling herself has stated once in an interview that _money_ is something\nwizards cannot simply materialise out of thin air,[8] or the economic system\nof the wizarding world would then be gravely flawed and disrupted. While the\n[Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Philosopher's_Stone \"Magical\nobjects in Harry Potter\") does permit [alchemy](/wiki/Alchemy \"Alchemy\"), this\nis portrayed as an extremely rare, even unique, object, whose owner does not\nexploit its powers.\n\n###\nEmotion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Emotion\")]\n\nAs explained earlier, young untrained wizards can trigger uncontrolled magic\nwhen they are in the state of heightened emotions. But emotions also affect\ntrained witches and wizards and their magical abilities. For instance, in\n_Half-Blood Prince_ , a heartbroken [Nymphadora Tonks](/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks\n\"Nymphadora Tonks\") temporarily loses her power as a\n[Metamorphmagus](/wiki/Metamorphmagus \"Metamorphmagus\") when [Remus\nLupin](/wiki/Remus_Lupin \"Remus Lupin\") starts distancing himself from her.\nThe form of her [Patronus](/wiki/Patronus_Charm \"Patronus Charm\") changes to\nreflect her depression. Another example is [Merope\nGaunt](/wiki/The_House_of_Gaunt \"The House of Gaunt\"), who only demonstrated\nany magical ability when removed from her father's oppression, but then lost\nit again when her husband abandoned her.\n\nSeveral magical spells require the use of certain emotions when casting them.\nThe Patronus charm, for example, requires the caster to concentrate on a happy\nmemory. (Force of will, under extenuating circumstances, helps a lot. An\nexample of this is when Harry is able to conjure a corporeal Patronus when\nSirius is in danger of being administered the Dementor's\nKiss.)[[HP3]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban \"Harry Potter and\nthe Prisoner of Azkaban\") Another example is the Cruciatus Curse, which causes\nimmense pain; as Harry discovers during a duel with [Bellatrix\nLestrange](/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange \"Bellatrix Lestrange\"), effective use of\nthis forbidden dark magic requires sadistic\ndesires.[[HP5]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix \"Harry Potter\nand the Order of the Phoenix\")\n\nLove (in its broadest meaning) is depicted as a particularly powerful form of\nmagic. According to Dumbledore, love is a \"force that is at once more\nwonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than forces\nof nature.\"[[HP5]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix \"Harry\nPotter and the Order of the Phoenix\") Lily's voluntary sacrifice on Harry's\nbehalf saves him from Voldemort as a baby, and Harry makes a similar sacrifice\nto save his friends at the end of _Deathly\nHallows_.[[HP7]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Harry Potter and\nthe Deathly Hallows\") A certain key prophecy in the series describes Harry as\nhaving \"power the Dark Lord knows not\", referencing his capacity for\nlove.[[HP5]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix \"Harry Potter and\nthe Order of the Phoenix\")\n\nTrue love is impossible to create magically;\n[Amortentia](/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter#Amortentia \"Potions in Harry\nPotter\"), a love potion, can only create a powerful sense of infatuation and\nobsession.\n\n## Magical\nabilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Magical abilities\")]\n\nThe following is a list of special abilities that a wizard or witch in the\nHarry Potter universe may have.\n\n###\nAnimagi[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Animagi\")]\n\nAn Animagus ([portmanteau](/wiki/Portmanteau \"Portmanteau\") of animal and\n[magus](/wiki/Magus \"Magus\")) is a witch or wizard who can turn into a\nparticular animal or magical creature at will. This ability is not innate: it\nmust be acquired by magical means. All Animagi must register at a central\nauthority by law, though a number of characters are revealed over the course\nof the series to have remained unregistered illegally: [James\nPotter](/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_\\(fictional_organisation\\)#James_Potter\n\"Order of the Phoenix \\(fictional organisation\\)\"), [Sirius\nBlack](/wiki/Sirius_Black \"Sirius Black\"), [Peter\nPettigrew](/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew \"Peter Pettigrew\") and [Rita\nSkeeter](/wiki/Rita_Skeeter \"Rita Skeeter\").\n\nAnimagi transformation can be performed wandlessly. Sirius and Peter are left\nwandless for over 10 years, but both retain the ability with no apparent ill\neffects. When Animagi transform, they take on the appearance of a normal\nanimal. However, in _[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of\nAzkaban](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban \"Harry Potter and the\nPrisoner of Azkaban\")_ , it is noted that Ron's pet rat Scabbers (later\nrevealed as Peter Pettigrew's Animagus form) has lived over twelve years when\nonly expected to live three. Also, an Animagus in animal form retains the\nability to think like a human, which is the principal difference between being\nan animagus and being transfigured into an animal. Otherwise, they would\nforget that they were a wizard and be trapped, unknowingly, in this form\nunless transformed back by another wizard. Characteristics of an Animagus'\nhuman form can manifest themselves in the animal transformation; for example,\nthe markings around McGonagall's eyes as a cat resemble her glasses. When an\nAnimagus registers, they must record all the defining physical traits of their\nanimal form so that the Ministry can identify them.\n\nEach Animagus has a specific animal form, and cannot transform into any other\nanimal. The animal cannot be chosen: it is uniquely suited to that\nindividual's personality, and in most cases the Animagus will change into the\nsame animal used in the person's [Patronus Charm](/wiki/Patronus_Charm\n\"Patronus Charm\").[11]\n\nExplicit emphasis is placed in the books on the differences between Animagi\nand [werewolves](/wiki/Werewolf_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Werewolf \\(Harry Potter\\)\").\nAnimagi have full control over their transformations and retain their minds,\nwhereas werewolves' transformations are involuntary and include severe changes\nin personality. After the person has transformed into a werewolf, he no longer\nremembers who he is; he would kill his best friend if he got anywhere near\nhim. A werewolf only responds to the call of his own kind. The only way that a\nwerewolf can retain his sanity, intelligence and memory while transformed is\nusing the Wolfsbane Potion.\n\n###\nMetamorphmagi[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Metamorphmagi\")]\n\nA **Metamorphmagus** (a [portmanteau](/wiki/Portmanteau \"Portmanteau\") of\n_[metamorph](/wiki/Metamorph \"Metamorph\")_ and _[magus](/wiki/Magus \"Magus\")_)\nis a witch or wizard born with the innate ability to change some or all of\ntheir appearance at will. The talent cannot be acquired; a witch or wizard who\nhas it must be born with it.\n\n[Nymphadora Tonks](/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks \"Nymphadora Tonks\") and her son,\n[Teddy Lupin](/wiki/Teddy_Lupin \"Teddy Lupin\") are currently the only known\nMetamorphmagi in the series; it is a very rare ability, possibly hereditary.\nTonks is known to change her hair colour and style according to her mood. She\neven appears as an old woman on occasion. She can also change her nose\nappearance, as she does when eating with the Weasley family to entertain Ginny\nand Hermione. Her son, Teddy Lupin, also inherited this trait, as his hair is\nmentioned repeatedly changing colour.\n\nThe extent of these appearance-altering abilities and the limits thereof are\nnot entirely clear. According to Rowling, a Metamorphmagus can alter his or\nher appearance completely, for instance, from black to white, young to old,\nhandsome to plain and so on.[12] In one example, Tonks changes her facial\nappearance by reshaping her nose into \"a beaklike protuberance like Snape's\",\nto \"something resembling a button mushroom\", and \"one like a pig snout\" which\nreminded Harry of his cousin Dudley.[13] The emotional state of a\nMetamorphmagus can affect their abilities.\n\n###\nParseltongue[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Parseltongue\")]\n\n**Parseltongue** is the language of snakes. It is often associated with Dark\nMagic, although Dumbledore stated that it is not necessarily an evil quality.\nThose possessing the ability to speak it (\"**Parselmouths** \") occur very\nrarely. People apparently acquire the skill through learning or via a method\nof [xenoglossia](/wiki/Xenoglossia \"Xenoglossia\"), such as through genetic\ninheritance (or by use of Dark or dangerous Magic). Harry was a Parselmouth\nuntil the age of 17. _[Harry Potter and the Chamber of\nSecrets](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets \"Harry Potter and the\nChamber of Secrets\")_ explains this was because of Voldemort's passing on some\nof his abilities to Harry the night he tried to kill him. _Deathly Hallows_\nreveals that a part of Voldemort's soul within Harry grants him this ability,\nwhich is later destroyed leaving Harry stripped of the ability.[14]\n\nOther known Parselmouths include [Salazar Slytherin](/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin\n\"Salazar Slytherin\") and his descendants, including the\n[Gaunts](/wiki/The_House_of_Gaunt \"The House of Gaunt\") and Voldemort.\nDumbledore can also understand Parseltongue; however, he learned it and did\nnot naturally possess the ability.[15] In _Half-Blood Prince_ he repeats\nMorfin Gaunt's words \"the big house over the way\", which were spoken in\nParseltongue.\n\nRon uses Parseltongue in the final book to reopen the [Chamber of\nSecrets](/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets \"Chamber of Secrets\"), but he is only\nimitating the sound of a phrase Harry used earlier in the book.\n\nRowling borrowed the term from \"an old word for someone who has a problem with\nthe mouth, like a [hare lip](/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate \"Cleft lip and\npalate\")\".[16]\n\nProfessor [Francis Nolan](/wiki/Francis_Nolan \"Francis Nolan\"), Professor of\nPhonetics at University of Cambridge, designed the version of Parseltongue\nused in the films as an [ergative-absolutive](/wiki/Ergative-absolutive\n\"Ergative-absolutive\") language featuring [geminate](/wiki/Geminate\n\"Geminate\") consonants and [VSO word order](/wiki/VSO_word_order \"VSO word\norder\"). It has a high frequency of [fricative](/wiki/Fricative \"Fricative\")\nand [pharyngeal consonants](/wiki/Pharyngeal_consonants \"Pharyngeal\nconsonants\") to acoustically approximate the physiology of a snake.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n###\nSeers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Seers\")]\n\nA **Seer** is a witch or wizard with the [clairvoyant](/wiki/Clairvoyant\n\"Clairvoyant\") ability to predict future events. The predictions given through\nthis ability can sometimes be [self-fulfilling prophecies](/wiki/Self-\nfulfilling_prophecies \"Self-fulfilling prophecies\"), and Dumbledore states in\n_Order of the Phoenix_ that not all of them come true, depending on the\nchoices made by those mentioned. This would seem to indicate that a Seer\npredicts possible or likely events, at least in some cases.\n\nIn the [Hall of Prophecy](/wiki/Hall_of_Prophecy \"Hall of Prophecy\") at the\n[Department of Mysteries](/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries \"Department of\nMysteries\"), thousands upon thousands of glass spheres are imbued with records\nof prophecies made by Seers. Only a person mentioned in a prophecy can safely\nretrieve it; anyone else who tries to do so will be driven insane.\n\nAccording to McGonagall, true Seers are extremely rare. [Sybill\nTrelawney](/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney \"Sybill Trelawney\") is the only Seer\nportrayed in the books, although it is mentioned that Sybill's great-great-\ngrandmother, Cassandra Trelawney, was a renowned Seer in her day. Trelawney is\nconsidered an \"old fraud\" by her students, and is sacked by [Dolores\nUmbridge](/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge \"Dolores Umbridge\") in the fifth book for it.\nHowever, she has twice made true prophecies. Sybill Trelawney is noted to\nnever remember that she has made a prophecy when it is a true one. She speaks\nin a hoarse voice, and only if a wizard is present will anyone know about it.\n\n### Legilimency and\nOcclumency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Legilimency and Occlumency\")]\n\n**Legilimency** is the magical skill of extracting feelings and memories from\nanother person's mind—a form of magical \"[telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy\n\"Telepathy\")\" (although Snape, an able practitioner of the art, dismisses the\ncolloquial term \"mind-reading\", as a drastic oversimplification). It also\nallows one to convey visions or memories to another person, whether real or\nimaginary. A witch or wizard possessing this skill is called a **Legilimens,**\nand can, for example, detect lies and deceit in another person, witness\nmemories in another person's past, or \"plant\" false visions in another's mind.\n\nThe counter-skill to Legilimency is **Occlumency** (and its user, known as an\n**Occlumens**), by which one can compartmentalize one's emotions, or prevent a\nLegilimens from discovering thoughts or memories which contradict one's spoken\nwords or actions. An advanced form of Occlumency is planting false temporary\nmemories inside an Occlumens' own head while blocking all other true memories,\nso if a Legilimens, even a highly skilled one, were to attempt to read the\nmind, he or she would find false memories only and believe everything was\nright.\n\nThe skills are first elaborated in _Order of the Phoenix_. Legilimency and\nOcclumency are not part of the normal curriculum at Hogwarts, and most\nstudents would graduate without learning them.\n\nVoldemort, [Snape](/wiki/Severus_Snape \"Severus Snape\"), and Dumbledore are\nall known to be skilled in Legilimency and Occlumency. Voldemort is said to be\nthe master of Legilimency by Snape, as he, in almost all cases, immediately\nknows if someone lied to him. In addition, in _Deathly Hallows_ , Voldemort\nrepeatedly uses Legilimency to interrogate his victims. Voldemort practices\nOcclumency throughout the period of _Half-Blood Prince_ to deny Harry access\nto his thoughts and emotions. However, in _Deathly Hallows_ , Voldemort\nrepeatedly loses grip, resulting in occasional but very powerful burst of\nthoughts, visions and emotions to be sent to Harry.\n\nThroughout the books, Snape is repeatedly said to be highly skilled in\nOcclumency.[17] This is how Snape was able to lie to Voldemort for years. Even\nbefore _Order of the Phoenix_ , Harry repeatedly gets the impression that\nSnape can read minds.\n\nBellatrix Lestrange and Draco also have skill in Occlumency, since Bellatrix\nwas clearly said to have taught Draco to shield his thoughts from\nSnape.[[HP6]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince \"Harry Potter and\nthe Half-Blood Prince\")\n\nDuring the _Order of Phoenix_ Snape is instructed by Dumbledore to give Harry\nlessons in Occlumency. Whether as a result of Snape's poor instruction, or\npoor aptitude on Harry's part, Harry did not make any progress. (Only once did\nHarry manage to overcome Snape with the use of Occlumency.)[18] In _Deathly\nHallows_ , Harry finally masters Occlumency—shutting his mind to\nVoldemort—when Dobby dies. He realises that his grief—or as Dumbledore calls\nit, love—is what can block out the Dark Lord.\n\nQueenie Goldstein, in _[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find\nThem](/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_\\(film\\) \"Fantastic Beasts\nand Where to Find Them \\(film\\)\")_ , is shown to be a proficient Legilimens,\nas she is able to read the minds of Jacob Kowalski and others in the film, as\nwell as sense and hear them through their thoughts.\n\n### Apparition and\nDisapparition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Apparition and Disapparition\")]\n\n**Apparition** is a magical form of [teleportation](/wiki/Teleportation\n\"Teleportation\"), through which a witch or wizard can disappear\n(\"**Disapparate** \") from one location and reappear (\"**Apparate** \") in\nanother. It is sometimes accompanied by a distinctive cracking or popping\nsound, though the most skilled wizards can Apparate \"so suddenly and silently\"\nthat they seem to have \"popped out of the ground\" (Dumbledore). The act is\nalso accompanied by a very unpleasant squeezing sensation, as though being\nsent through a tight rubber tube, according to\nHarry.[[HP6]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince \"Harry Potter and\nthe Half-Blood Prince\")\n\nThe Ministry of Magic licenses Apparition. A witch or wizard must be 17 years\nold or older and have a licence to Apparate as a means of transportation in\nmuch the same way real-world governments require individuals to have a\n[licence to drive a motor vehicle](/wiki/Driver%27s_license \"Driver's\nlicense\"). Students at Hogwarts may attend Ministry-administered Apparition\nlessons during their sixth year, and take their examination once they turn\nseventeen. It is shown that although it is possible to Apparate without a\nlicence, it is not usually done (unless in lessons) and is illegal. In\n_Deathly Hallows_ , Harry does not possess a licence, but since his Trace has\nbeen lifted, the Ministry is likely unaware that he does it.\n\nLearning to Apparate is difficult, and students run the risk of _splinching_\n—being physically split between the origin and destination—which requires the\nassistance of the Ministry's [Accidental Magic Reversal\nSquad](/wiki/Accidental_Magic_Reversal_Squad \"Accidental Magic Reversal\nSquad\") to undo properly, although essence of [\ndittany](/wiki/Origanum_dictamnus \"Origanum dictamnus\") can also mend certain\nwounds. Splinching is quite common during lessons, and can be uncomfortable\n(and at times rather gruesome) depending on the body parts splinched, but is\nultimately harmless if properly reversed. It is implied that though Ron can\nApparate, he isn't terribly skilled at it, seeing as he splinches himself at\nleast three times (once losing half an eyebrow, two fingernails and part of\nhis arm.); Harry and Hermione both pick up the skill quickly in comparison. As\nexplained in the _Half-Blood Prince_ , there is no word spell to Apparate or\nDisapparate, but the caster has to concentrate on the location on which he has\nto apparate, needs to be fully focused on the spell, and also has to \"feel\" it\nthrough the whole body.\n\nIt has been indicated that it is considered rude to Apparate directly into a\nprivate area, such as a home. Dumbledore states in _Half-Blood Prince_ that it\nwould be \"quite as rude as kicking down the front door\". For this reason, and\nfor reasons of security, many homes have Anti-Apparition spells protecting\nthem from uninvited intrusions. The accepted way to travel to a home is to\nApparate to a nearby location and continue to the final destination on foot.\nApparition is considered unreliable over long distances, and even experienced\nusers of the technique sometimes prefer other means of transport, such as\n[broomsticks](/wiki/Broomsticks_in_Harry_Potter \"Broomsticks in Harry\nPotter\"). Rowling has stated that Apparating over long distances depends on\nthe skill of the wizard, and \"Cross-continental Apparition would almost\ncertainly result in severe injury or death.\"[19] Indeed, even the prodigiously\nskilled [Lord Voldemort](/wiki/Lord_Voldemort \"Lord Voldemort\") elects to fly\nback to England after visiting the far-flung [Nurmengard](/wiki/Nurmengard\n\"Nurmengard\").\n\nFor reasons of security, the grounds and buildings of Hogwarts are protected\nby ancient Anti-Apparition and Anti-Disapparition spells, which prevent humans\nfrom Apparating on the school grounds. There is also a spell that prevents\nindividuals from Disapparating, which Dumbledore places on the Death Eaters\ncaptured at the Ministry in _Order of the Phoenix_ ; a sister spell, which\nallows one to Apparate into a location but prevents them from Disapparating\nout of it, is cast by the Death Eaters in Hogsmeade in concordance with the\nCaterwauling Charm. Dumbledore is the only person who can both Apparate and\nDisapparate from the school grounds, since he is the headmaster.\n\nA witch or wizard can use _Side-Along Apparition_ to take others with them\nduring Apparition. Dumbledore successfully transports Harry this way several\ntimes in _Half-Blood Prince_ , and notably, Harry's first non-lesson attempt\nat the skill is the Side-Along Apparition with the weakened Dumbledore when\nthey return from the seaside cave.\n\nIn the _Order of the Phoenix_ film, Death Eaters and Order members Apparate\nand Disapparate in clouds of smoke. Death Eaters appear and disappear in black\nsmoke, Order members in white. In the film, both sides also appear to be able\nto \"half-apparate\" in which their bodies were made out of smoke, giving them\nthe ability to fly. Both times Fred and George apparated and disapparated,\nthey did it with a _pop_ as in the books.\n\nIn the books, the words \"Apparate\" and \"Disapparate\", like many other\n[neologisms](/wiki/Neologism \"Neologism\") used by Rowling, are\n[capitalised](/wiki/Capitalization \"Capitalization\"), whereas established\nEnglish words such as \"jinx\" and \"hex\" are not. The words themselves are most\nlikely derived from the French _apparaître_ and _disparaître_ , meaning 'to\nappear' and 'to disappear'. Another possible derivation is from the English\nword \"apparition\", meaning \"a supernatural appearance of a person or thing;\nanything that appears, especially something remarkable or startling; an act of\nappearing\", which comes from the Latin _\" apparitio\"_, meaning attendance.\n\"Disapparate\" probably comes from the same word but with the prefix: \"dis-\"\nexpressing negation or reversal.\n\n### Other\nteleportation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Other teleportation\")]\n\nSome magical creatures have their own forms of instantaneous travel, such as a\nhouse elf's ability to teleport or a phoenix's ability to appear and disappear\nin a burst of flame. Unlike wizards, these creatures are not restricted by\nanti-Apparition magic. [Dobby](/wiki/Dobby_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Dobby \\(Harry\nPotter\\)\"), [Kreacher](/wiki/Kreacher \"Kreacher\") and the rest of the house-\nelf population can Apparate within the Hogwarts grounds, as they demonstrate\non multiple occasions, most notably when Dobby visits Harry in the hospital\nwing, and when Harry summons Dobby and Kreacher and assigns them to tail Draco\nMalfoy. [Fawkes](/wiki/Fawkes \"Fawkes\") disapparates from the headmaster's\noffice at Hogwarts along with Dumbledore when the latter evades arrest at the\nhands of Ministry officials in _Order of the Phoenix_.\n\nSome magical devices like the [Floo\nNetwork](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Floo_Powder \"Magical objects in\nHarry Potter\"), [Portkeys](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Portkeys\n\"Magical objects in Harry Potter\") and [Vanishing\nCabinets](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Vanishing_Cabinet \"Magical\nobjects in Harry Potter\") also provide forms of magical teleportation.\n\n### Veela\ncharm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Veela charm\")]\n\nAn ability attributed to [Veela](/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#veela\n\"Magical creatures in Harry Potter\") and those of Veela heritage, such as\n[Fleur Delacour](/wiki/Fleur_Delacour \"Fleur Delacour\"). It is used to charm\nmales, much like the [Sirens](/wiki/Siren_\\(mythology\\) \"Siren \\(mythology\\)\")\nin _[The Odyssey](/wiki/The_Odyssey \"The Odyssey\")_. Men who are exposed to it\nover time become more resistant to it, although the Veela charm takes full\neffect if the Veela surprises the man, as noted by Ron in _Half-Blood Prince_.\n\nAs shown in _Goblet of Fire_ , Veela hair can be used as cores to create\nmagical wands. According to famed wandmaker Mr. Ollivander, these wands are a\nlittle \"temperamental\".\n\n### Magical\nresistance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Magical resistance\")]\n\nThis refers to a certain degree of immunity against hexes and spells found in\npowerful creatures such as [trolls](/wiki/Trolls \"Trolls\"),\n[dragons](/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#Dragons \"Magical creatures\nin Harry Potter\"), and [giants](/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#Giants\n\"Magical creatures in Harry Potter\"). Hagrid is resistant to certain spells,\nlike the Stunning Spell, due to his giant blood. This type of resistance is\nnot insurmountable; if enough Stunning Spells, for example, are fired at a\ncreature with magical resistance at once, the creature may still be rendered\nunconscious. Also, wizards and witches can resist certain spells with the\npower of their own sheer will, such as Harry did in _Goblet of Fire_ , when\n[Barty Crouch Jr.](/wiki/Barty_Crouch_Jr. \"Barty Crouch Jr.\") disguised as\nAlastor Moody tried to control Harry with the Imperius curse and Harry\nresisted.\n\n## Subjects at\nHogwarts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Subjects at Hogwarts\")]\n\nAt Hogwarts, students must study a core group of subjects for the first two\nyears, after which they must choose between several electives. During their\nfinal two years, students are permitted to take more specialized subjects such\nas Alchemy.\n\nTransfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions, Astronomy,\nHistory of Magic, and Herbology are compulsory subjects for the first five\nyears, as well as flying lessons. At the end of their second year, students\nare required to add at least two optional subjects to their syllabus for the\nstart of the third year. The five choices are Arithmancy, Muggle Studies,\nDivination, Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures. Very\nspecialised subjects such as [Alchemy](/wiki/Alchemy \"Alchemy\") are sometimes\noffered in the final two years, if there is sufficient demand. There is a\ntotal of twelve named [Professors](/wiki/Hogwarts_staff \"Hogwarts staff\") at\nHogwarts, each specializing in one of these subjects.\n\n###\nTransfiguration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Transfiguration\")]\n\n**Transfiguration** is essentially the art of changing the properties of an\nobject.[20] Transfiguration is a theory-based subject, including topics such\nas \"Switching Spells\" (altering only a part of some object, such as when\nHagrid gave Dudley a pig tail); Vanishing Spells (causing an object to\ncompletely disappear);[[OotP\nCh.13]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix \"Harry Potter and the\nOrder of the Phoenix\") and Conjuring Spells (creating objects out of thin\nair).[[OotP Ch.13]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix \"Harry\nPotter and the Order of the Phoenix\") It is possible to change inanimate\nobjects into animate ones and vice versa—Minerva McGonagall, the class's\nteacher, transfigures her desk into a [pig](/wiki/Domestic_pig \"Domestic pig\")\nand back in _Philosopher 's Stone_.[[PS\nCh.8]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone \"Harry Potter and the\nPhilosopher's Stone\")\n\n### Defence Against the Dark\nArts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Defence Against the Dark Arts\")]\n\n**Defence Against the Dark Arts** , commonly shortened to **D.A.D.A.** ,[21]\nis the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the\n[Dark Arts](/wiki/Dark_Arts_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Dark Arts \\(Harry Potter\\)\"),\nand to be protected from Dark creatures. In _[Harry Potter and the Deathly\nHallows](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows\")_ , with Death-Eaters in charge of the school, the subject is\nrenamed the **Dark Arts** , and involves pupils practicing the Cruciatus Curse\non those who have earned detentions.[[DH\nCh.29]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows\") The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff\nmembers—throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has\nretained the post for more than one school year. Harry is exceptionally\nskilled in this subject. During the period the story takes place, the class is\ntaught by [Quirinus Quirrell](/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell \"Quirinus Quirrell\")\n([book one](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone \"Harry Potter and\nthe Philosopher's Stone\")), [Gilderoy Lockhart](/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart\n\"Gilderoy Lockhart\") ([book two](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets\n\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\")), [Remus Lupin](/wiki/Remus_Lupin\n\"Remus Lupin\") ([book three](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban\n\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\")), [Bartemius Crouch\nJr](/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Jr \"Bartemius Crouch Jr\") impersonating [Alastor\n\"Mad-eye\" Moody](/wiki/Alastor_Moody \"Alastor Moody\") ([book\nfour](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire \"Harry Potter and the Goblet\nof Fire\")), [Dolores Umbridge](/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge \"Dolores Umbridge\")\n([book five](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix \"Harry Potter and\nthe Order of the Phoenix\")), [Severus Snape](/wiki/Severus_Snape \"Severus\nSnape\") ([book six](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-blood_Prince \"Harry Potter\nand the Half-blood Prince\")), and [Amycus Carrow](/wiki/Amycus_Carrow \"Amycus\nCarrow\") ([book seven](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Harry\nPotter and the Deathly Hallows\")). Hagrid suggests in _[Harry Potter and the\nChamber of Secrets](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets \"Harry\nPotter and the Chamber of Secrets\")_ that _\" They're startin' ter think the\njob's jinxed. No one's lasted long for a while now.\"_ In _Half-Blood Prince_ ,\nDumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application\nfor it was rejected.[[HBP Ch.20]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince\n\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\") The existence of the jinx was\neventually confirmed by Rowling. The position had also been coveted by Snape,\nbut he was denied the position as well. Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A.\nprofessor in _Half-Blood Prince_. Rowling announced in an interview that once\nVoldemort had died, the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a\npermanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of _Deathly\nHallows_ and the [epilogue](/wiki/Epilogue \"Epilogue\"), set nineteen years\nafterwards. Furthermore, she imagines that Harry Potter occasionally comes to\nthe class to give lectures on the subject.[22]\n\n###\nCharms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Charms\")]\n\n**Charms** is the class that teaches how to develop incantations for the uses\nof bewitchment. Rowling has described Charms as a type of magic spell\nconcerned with giving an object _new_ and unexpected properties.[20] Charms\nclasses are described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons are\nlargely practical.[[OotP\nCh.18]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix \"Harry Potter and the\nOrder of the Phoenix\") Many of the\n[exposition](/wiki/Exposition_\\(literary_technique\\) \"Exposition \\(literary\ntechnique\\)\") sequences in the books are set in Charms classes, which are on\nthe second floor of Hogwarts. The class is taught by [Filius\nFlitwick](/wiki/Filius_Flitwick \"Filius Flitwick\").\n\n###\nPotions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Potions\")]\n\nFurther information: [Potions in Harry Potter](/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter\n\"Potions in Harry Potter\")\n\n**Potions** is described as the art of creating mixtures with magical effects.\nIt requires the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at the right times\nand temperatures. As to the question of whether a muggle could brew a potion,\ngiven the correct magical ingredients, Rowling has said, \"Potions seems, on\nthe face of it, to be the most muggle-friendly subject. But there does come a\npoint in which you need to do more than stir.\"[23] Rowling later confirmed on\n[Pottermore](/wiki/Pottermore \"Pottermore\") that \"There is always some element\nof wandwork necessary to make a potion.\"[24] Snape's lessons are depicted as\nunhappy, oppressing times set in a gloomy dungeon in the basement of the\ncastle, whilst Slughorn's, who replaces Snape as Potions Master, are shown as\nmore cheerful and even fun at times.\n\n###\nAstronomy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Astronomy\")]\n\n**Astronomy** classes take place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in\nHogwarts, and are taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involve\nobservations of the night skies with [telescopes](/wiki/Telescope\n\"Telescope\"). No astronomy lessons are shown in the books, but they are\nfrequently referenced. Rowling describes one of Harry's Astronomy exams in\n_Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_. Also, bits of the Astronomy Tower\nare seen throughout the [film series](/wiki/Film_series \"Film series\"), such\nas HP2 and HP3, and featured in _[Half-Blood Prince](/wiki/Half-Blood_Prince\n\"Half-Blood Prince\")_ , as the place where Dumbledore died, and seen in\n_[Deathly Hallows](/wiki/Deathly_Hallows \"Deathly Hallows\")_. Known student\nhomework activities include learning the names of stars, constellations and\nplanets, and their location, movements, and environments.\n\n### History of\nMagic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: History of Magic\")]\n\n**History of Magic** is the study of magical history. [Cuthbert\nBinns](/wiki/Cuthbert_Binns \"Cuthbert Binns\")' lessons are depicted as some of\nthe most boring at Hogwarts. They are only lectures, given without pause,\nabout significant events in wizarding history. Topics have included goblin\nrebellions, giant wars, and the origins of wizarding secrecy. This is the only\nclass at Hogwarts that is taught by a ghost, as the professor never noticed he\nhad died and simply continued teaching as if nothing had changed.\n\n###\nHerbology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Herbology\")]\n\n**Herbology** is the study of magical plants and how to take care of, utilise\nand combat them. There are at least three greenhouses described in the books,\nholding a variety of magical plants. Herbology is also the only subject\nNeville excels in. The epilogue to _Deathly Hallows_ explains that he later\nreplaces Professor Sprout as the Herbology teacher.\n\n###\nArithmancy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Arithmancy\")]\n\n**Arithmancy** is a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of\nnumbers. As Harry Potter does not take this subject, the class is never\ndescribed in the books. It is, however, a favourite subject of Hermione.\nArithmancy is reportedly difficult, as it requires memorising or working with\nmany charts. In _Order of the Phoenix_ , it is mentioned that the study of\nArithmancy is required to become a Curse-Breaker for\n[Gringotts](/wiki/Gringotts \"Gringotts\"). The subject is taught by Professor\nSeptima Vector.\n\n### Study of Ancient\nRunes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Study of Ancient Runes\")]\n\n**Study of Ancient Runes** , more commonly known as **Ancient Runes** , is a\ngenerally theoretical subject that studies the ancient runic scripts. Because\nonly [Hermione](/wiki/Hermione_Granger \"Hermione Granger\") studies it, little\nelse is known about this subject, taught by Professor Bathsheba Babbling.[25]\nIn _Deathly Hallows_ Dumbledore bequeaths his copy of _[The Tales of Beedle\nthe Bard](/wiki/The_Tales_of_Beedle_the_Bard \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\")_\n, which is written in ancient runes, to [Hermione](/wiki/Hermione_Granger\n\"Hermione Granger\").\n\n###\nDivination[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Divination\")]\n\n**[Divination](/wiki/Divination \"Divination\")** is the art of predicting the\nfuture. Various methods are described, including [tea\nleaves](/wiki/Tasseography \"Tasseography\"), [fire omens](/wiki/Divination\n\"Divination\"), [crystal balls](/wiki/Crystal_ball \"Crystal ball\"),\n[palmistry](/wiki/Palmistry \"Palmistry\"), [cartomancy](/wiki/Cartomancy\n\"Cartomancy\") (including the reading of conventional [playing\ncards](/wiki/Playing_cards \"Playing cards\") and the [tarot](/wiki/Tarot\n\"Tarot\")), [astrology](/wiki/Astrology \"Astrology\"), and [dream\ninterpretations](/wiki/Dream_interpretation \"Dream interpretation\").\nDivination is described by Professor McGonagall as \"one of the most imprecise\nbranches of magic\".[[PA Ch.6]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban\n\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\") Supporters of the subject claim\nthat it is an inexact science that requires innate gifts such as the \"Inner\nEye\". Those opposed claim that the subject is irrelevant and fraudulent. Harry\nis first taught Divination by Professor Trelawney, and then later by Firenze\nafter Trelawney is sacked by [Dolores Umbridge](/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge\n\"Dolores Umbridge\") in Harry's fifth year. In the sixth (and presumably\nseventh) year, Firenze and Professor Trelawney share Divination classes,\ndivided by year.\n\n### Care of Magical\nCreatures[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Care of Magical Creatures\")]\n\n**Care of Magical Creatures** is the class which instructs students on how to\ncare for [magical beasts](/wiki/Magical_creatures_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Magical\ncreatures \\(Harry Potter\\)\"). Classes are held outside the castle. In Harry's\nfirst two years, the class is taken by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn who then\nretires \"in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs\". Dumbledore\nthen recruits the gamekeeper [Rubeus Hagrid](/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid \"Rubeus\nHagrid\") to accept a teaching position along with his gamekeeping duties.\nAlthough Hagrid is obviously very experienced and knowledgeable, he doesn't\n\"have a normal person's view of what's dangerous\", an example being that the\nCare of Magical Creatures students were required to get a literally ferocious\ntextbook called the \"Monster Book of Monsters\", and so consistently misjudges\nthe risk that the animals he uses in his lessons pose to his students[[PA\nCh.6]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban \"Harry Potter and the\nPrisoner of Azkaban\")[[GF Ch.13]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire\n\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\"), which sometimes results in chaos. When\nHagrid is absent, his lessons are taken over by Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank, a\nwitch and an acquaintance of Dumbledore's.\n\n### Muggle\nStudies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Muggle Studies\")]\n\n**Muggle Studies** is a class which involves the study of the\n[muggle](/wiki/Muggle \"Muggle\") (non-magical) culture \"from a wizarding point\nof view.\" The only need for witches and wizards to learn about muggle\n[ways](/wiki/Culture \"Culture\") and [means](/wiki/Technology \"Technology\") is\nto ensure they can blend in with muggles while needing to do so (for example,\nat the 1994 Quidditch World Cup). As the class is only mentioned as being\ntaken by [Hermione](/wiki/Hermione_Granger \"Hermione Granger\"), and for just\none year, little is known about its curriculum. In the opening chapter of the\nfinal book, Voldemort murders Professor [Charity\nBurbage](/wiki/Charity_Burbage \"Charity Burbage\") because she portrays muggles\nin a positive light and is opposed to limiting wizardry to only people of\npure-blood origins. For the rest of the academic year covered by _Deathly\nHallows_ , the Death Eater [Alecto Carrow](/wiki/Alecto_Carrow \"Alecto\nCarrow\") teaches Muggle Studies. However, her lessons (which are made\ncompulsory) mainly describe muggles and muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of\npersecution.\n\n###\nAlchemy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Alchemy\")]\n\n**Alchemy** classes are not mentioned in the _Harry Potter_ series; however,\nRowling has used Alchemy as an example of a 'specialized' subject offered when\nthere is sufficient demand. Alchemy is a philosophical tradition searching for\nthe [philosopher's stone](/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone \"Philosopher's stone\"),\nwhich is said to have the power to turn base metals into gold and to contain\nthe [elixir of life](/wiki/Elixir_of_life \"Elixir of life\"), which makes or\nkeeps the drinker young and immortal. As mentioned in _Harry Potter and the\nPhilosopher 's Stone_, Nicholas Flamel created a Philosopher's Stone, but it\nwas destroyed at the end of Harry's first year.\n\n###\nFlying[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Flying\")]\n\n**Flying** is the class that teaches the use of\n[broomsticks](/wiki/Broomsticks_in_Harry_Potter \"Broomsticks in Harry Potter\")\nmade for the use of flying and is taught only to Hogwarts first years by\n[Rolanda Hooch](/wiki/Rolanda_Hooch \"Rolanda Hooch\"). The subject is the only\none that requires physicality. The only flying lesson depicted in the Harry\nPotter series is in _[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_\\(film\\) \"Harry Potter\nand the Philosopher's Stone \\(film\\)\")_.\n\n###\nApparition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Apparition\")]\n\n**Apparition** is an optional class for those in the sixth and seventh years\nat Hogwarts, in preparation for obtaining their licence. In Harry's sixth\nyear, [Wilkie Twycross](/wiki/Wilkie_Twycross \"Wilkie Twycross\"), a Ministry\nof Magic Apparition instructor, teaches the lessons. Magical enchantments on\nHogwarts castle and grounds prevent Apparition and Disapparition inside the\ncastle; however _Half-Blood Prince_ explains that these protections are\ntemporarily relaxed within the Great Hall for short periods to permit students\nto practice. Students are warned, though, that they will not be able to\nApparate outside of the Great Hall and that it would be unwise to try.\n\n## Spell-like\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Spell-like effects\")]\n\n### Unbreakable\nVow[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Unbreakable Vow\")]\n\nThe **Unbreakable Vow** is a voluntary agreement made between two witches or\nwizards. It must be performed with a witness (\"Bonder\") on hand, holding their\nwand on the agreeing persons' linked hands to bind them with magic as a tongue\nof flame. The Vow is not literally \"unbreakable\" as the person taking it is\nstill able to go back on his or her word, but doing so will cause instant\ndeath. The Unbreakable Vow was first introduced in _Half-Blood Prince_ , in\nwhich Snape made a promise to Narcissa Malfoy to protect Draco, with Bellatrix\nas the \"Bonder\", as her son attempted to fulfil the Dark Lord's task, and for\nSnape to fulfil the task if something should prevent Draco from doing it.\nAnother example in _Half-Blood Prince_ occurs when Ron tells Harry how Fred\nand George tried to make him undertake an Unbreakable Vow, but because of\ntheir father's intervention, they did not succeed.\n\n### Priori\nIncantatem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: Priori Incantatem\")]\n\n**Priori Incantatem** (from Latin: _priorem incantatum_ \\- **a previous\nspell**), or the **Reverse Spell Effect** , is used to detect the spells cast\nby a wand. The spells cast by the wand will emerge in smoky or ghost-like\nreplicas in reverse order, with the latest spell emerging first. It is first\nencountered in _Goblet of Fire_ when the house elf Winky is found holding\nHarry's wand. This spell is used to reveal that it was indeed Harry's wand\nthat cast the Dark Mark. In _[Harry Potter and the Half Blood\nPrince](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half_Blood_Prince \"Harry Potter and the\nHalf Blood Prince\")_ , it is revealed that the teenage Voldemort murdered his\nfather and grandparents using his uncle Morfin's wand, knowing that, when\nexamined, the wand would incriminate Morfin as the murderer. In _Deathly\nHallows_ , Harry fears that a _Priori Incantatem_ spell will be used on\nHermione's wand after the [Death Eaters](/wiki/Death_Eaters \"Death Eaters\")\nget hold of it. This would reveal that she had accidentally broken his holly-\nand-phoenix-feather wand when a curse misfired and they both narrowly escaped\nVoldemort earlier. As a result, the protection of the shared cores was lost\nand, worse still, this would now be made known to Voldemort. During the final\nduel between Harry and Voldemort, the latter mentions that he knows that the\nholly and phoenix wand is destroyed, implying that the Priori Incantatem has\nindeed been performed on Hermione's wand, as they had feared.\n\nForcing two wands that share the source of their cores to do battle can also\ncause a more potent form of Priori Incantatem. The tips of the two wands will\nconnect, forming a thick golden \"thread\" of energy, and the two wands' masters\nfight a battle of wills. The loser's\n[wand](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter \"Magical objects in Harry\nPotter\") will regurgitate shadows of spells that it has cast in reverse order.\nThis phenomenon occurs during the duel between Harry and Voldemort at the end\nof _Goblet of Fire_. Their simultaneous spells (Harry and Voldemort cast\n\"Expelliarmus\" and \"Avada Kedavra\" respectively) trigger the threads, and as\nVoldemort loses the battle of wills, his wand regurgitates, in reverse order,\nechoes of the people his wand had last murdered: [Cedric\nDiggory](/wiki/Cedric_Diggory \"Cedric Diggory\"); [Frank\nBryce](/wiki/Frank_Bryce \"Frank Bryce\"); [Bertha Jorkins](/wiki/Bertha_Jorkins\n\"Bertha Jorkins\"); as well as Harry's parents. Harry was previously informed\nby [Mr. Ollivander](/wiki/Mr._Ollivander \"Mr. Ollivander\") that the holly wand\nthat \"chose\" Harry was the \"brother\" of the yew wand that gave him the\nlightning-shaped scar on his forehead, although the significance of this was\nnot discussed then. Dumbledore later reveals to Harry that his and Voldemort's\nwands both contain a tail feather given by Dumbledore's pet\n[phoenix](/wiki/Phoenix_\\(mythology\\) \"Phoenix \\(mythology\\)\"),\n[Fawkes](/wiki/Magical_creatures_\\(Harry_Potter\\)#Fawkes \"Magical creatures\n\\(Harry Potter\\)\").\n\n## Dark\nArts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=36\n\"Edit section: Dark Arts\")]\n\nThe **Dark Arts** are magical spells and practices that are usually used for\nmalicious purposes. Practitioners of Dark Arts are referred to as Dark witches\nor wizards. The most prominent of these is Voldemort, known to them as the\nDark Lord. His followers, known as [Death Eaters](/wiki/Death_Eater \"Death\nEater\"), practice the Dark Arts while doing his bidding.\n\nThe type of spells characteristic of Dark Arts are known as curses,[26] which\nusually cause harm to the target. All, to a certain degree, are in some\ncircumstances justifiable. The motivation of the caster affects a curse's\nresult. This is most notable in the case of _Cruciatus_ : when cast by Harry,\nangered by the death of his godfather at Bellatrix's hands and desiring to\npunish her, it causes a short moment of pain. As Bellatrix herself comments,\nrighteous anger does not allow the spell to work for long. When cast by\nfigures such as Voldemort, who desire to inflict pain for its own sake, it\ncauses intense agony that can last as long as the Dark witch or wizard\ndesires. Use of Dark Magic can corrupt the soul and body; Voldemort has used\nsuch magic in his quest to prolong his life and obtain great power. The Dark\nArts also cause Voldemort to look deformed and inhuman, a side effect of\nsplitting his soul into Horcruxes.\n\nAccording to Snape, the Dark Arts \"are many, varied, ever-changing and\neternal... unfixed, mutating, indestructible\".[27] In magical dueling, there\nare any number of spells that may be used to attack, immobilise, or disarm an\nopponent without causing pain or lasting harm; however, spells such as the\nCruciatus Curse or Sectumsempra, judged to be Dark by reliable authorities,\nwound or seriously distress a victim in some way. Dark spells can be\nclassified into three groups: jinxes, hexes & curses.\n\nIn the wizarding world, use of the Dark Arts is strongly stigmatised and even\nillegal; however, these spells are prevalent enough that even before the rise\nof Voldemort, many schools, (including Hogwarts), taught [Defence Against the\nDark Arts](/wiki/Subjects_at_Hogwarts#Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts \"Subjects\nat Hogwarts\") as a standard subject. Techniques include anti-curses and simple\nspells to disable or disarm attackers or fight off certain creatures. Some\nschools, such as [Durmstrang](/wiki/Durmstrang \"Durmstrang\"), teach Dark\nMagic. A Dark Arts class is also taught at Hogwarts while it is under Death\nEater control.\n\n### Unforgivable\nCurses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=37\n\"Edit section: Unforgivable Curses\")]\n\nThe **Unforgivable Curses** are some of the most powerful known Dark Arts\nspells. They were first classified as unforgivable in 1717. Used by the books'\nvillains, such as Voldemort and the [Death Eaters](/wiki/Death_Eater \"Death\nEater\") and in some cases the Ministry of Magic, their use inspires horror and\ngreat fear amongst others. The curses are so named because their use is\nforbidden and unforgivable in the wizarding world and is punishable by a life\nsentence in [Azkaban](/wiki/Azkaban \"Azkaban\"). The only exception is if a\nperson is proved to have done them under the influence of mind control. These\ncurses are thus very rarely used openly.\n\nThe Unforgivable Curses include:\n\n  * _Avada Kedavra_ , the Killing Curse. The curse is used for murder. This is one of the most powerful curses. Normally, it cannot be stopped or deflected, but it can be dodged or obstructed with a physical object. The spell causes immediate, painless death, and cannot be reversed. Casting it requires immense magical power, so much so that the combined power of an entire class of 4th year students is not sufficient for it. The curse, when summoned, is shown as a bright green light (a bolt or beam of green light in the films). [Harry Potter](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(character\\) \"Harry Potter \\(character\\)\") is the only person known to have survived (twice), nullified (once) and deflected (once) this curse.\n  * _Crucio_ , the Cruciatus Curse. The curse is used for [torturing](/wiki/Torture \"Torture\") a person by causing them physical pain and agony. The strength of the curse is determined by the person who cast it. The curse is so powerful that it can even torture a person to the point that they are exhausted to death, or in a more sadistic case, it causes permanent amnesia and insanity (the case of Neville's parents, who were tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange). Effective casting requires the caster to have sadistic desires. Harry finds out in _Order of the Phoenix_ while attempting to use the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix that the caster must truly want their victim to suffer for the spell to work, and that his righteous anger is not enough. The curse, when summoned, is shown in a bright-faded blue light (though it is usually invisible or even a red bolt of light in the films). When [Hogwarts](/wiki/Hogwarts \"Hogwarts\") was under [Death Eater](/wiki/Death_Eater \"Death Eater\") control, the Dark Arts teacher forced the students in his class to use the Cruciatus Curse on students who had been assigned detention.\n  * _Imperio_ , the Imperius Curse. The curse is used for [mind control](/wiki/Mind_control \"Mind control\") or [hypnosis](/wiki/Hypnosis \"Hypnosis\") and can force the victim to do things he/she would be unwilling to do or even incapable of under normal circumstances. The strength (and also the duration) of the curse is determined by the determination of the person who cast it, as well as by the level of resistance of the victim. The curse, when summoned, is shown in a bright haze (while it was either invisible or green, mist-like haze in the films). Harry Potter resisted an Imperius Curse cast by Voldemort.\n\n  \nThe use of the Unforgivable Curses was authorised against Voldemort and his\nfollowers by [Bartemius Crouch Sr](/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic#Barty_Crouch,_Sr\n\"Ministry of Magic\"), during the First Wizarding War. (Shortly after his\nresurrection, Voldemort names two Death Eaters \"killed by\n[Aurors](/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic#Auror_Office \"Ministry of Magic\")\".) In\naddition, in _Deathly Hallows_ , the Unforgivable Curses are used liberally by\ngood characters, ranging from [Professor\nMcGonagall](/wiki/Professor_McGonagall \"Professor McGonagall\") with the\nImperius Curse, to Harry effectively using the Cruciatus Curse. He also uses\nthe Imperius Curse on a goblin and a suspicious Death Eater during their\ndisguised attack upon Gringotts Bank.\n\n### Dark\nMark[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=38\n\"Edit section: Dark Mark\")]\n\nThe **Dark Mark** is the symbol of Voldemort and the Death Eaters and takes\nthe form of a skull with a snake coming out of the mouth in place of a tongue.\nThe mark is cast into the sky by [Death Eaters](/wiki/Death_Eater \"Death\nEater\") whenever they have murdered someone. The spell used by Death Eaters to\nconjure the Mark is Morsmordre. It first appears in _Goblet of Fire_ and is\ndescribed as a \"colossal skull, composed of what looked like emerald stars,\nwith a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue\". Once in the sky it\nwas \"blazing in a haze of greenish smoke\". Dark Marks are also branded on the\nleft forearm of the closest followers of Voldemort. The mark serves as a\nconnection between Voldemort and each who bears it; he can summon them by\ntouching his mark, causing it and those of his followers to burn and change\ncolour. Death Eaters can summon Voldemort in the same fashion. Following\nVoldemort's ultimate defeat, the Dark Marks on his Death Eaters fade into a\nscar \"similar\" to Harry's.[14] In the books, the Dark Mark is described as\ngreen; however, in the films, it was only green at the Quidditch World Cup. In\nall other film appearances it has been grey.\n\n###\nInferius[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=39\n\"Edit section: Inferius\")]\n\n    _Distinguish from[Infernus](/wiki/Infernus_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Infernus \\(disambiguation\\)\")._\n\nAn **Inferius** (plural: **Inferi**) is a [corpse](/wiki/Dead_body \"Dead\nbody\") controlled through a Dark wizard's spells. An Inferius is not alive,\nbut a dead body that has been bewitched into acting like a puppet for the\n[witch](/wiki/Witch \"Witch\") or wizard; this manifests itself as a white mist\nin the controlled corpse's eyes. They cannot think for themselves: they are\ncreated to perform a specific duty assigned by the Dark wizard who commands\nthem, and as seen in the Inferi guarding Voldemort's Horcrux in a seaside\ncave, remain idle until their task can be performed. This task is then\nthoughtlessly carried out, whether or not it will produce any result. Inferi\nare difficult to harm by magic; however, they can be repelled by fire or any\nother forms of heat or light, as the Inferi in Voldemort's cave had never been\nexposed to either of these elements. When defeated, they return to their idle\nstate.\n\nInferi are considered dangerous and frightening enough by the magical world\nthat impersonating an Inferius (as [Mundungus\nFletcher](/wiki/Mundungus_Fletcher \"Mundungus Fletcher\") does in _Half-Blood\nPrince_) is an offence worthy of imprisonment in [Azkaban](/wiki/Azkaban\n\"Azkaban\").\n\nThe Ministry of Magic fears that Voldemort is killing enough people to make an\narmy of Inferi: as they are dead, they are very difficult to stop. When\nVoldemort was hiding one of his [Horcruxes](/wiki/Horcruxes \"Horcruxes\") in\nthe past, he filled a lake in a cave with many Inferi, which were to attack\nand drown anyone but Voldemort who came into the cavern and took the locket.\nWhen Harry and Dumbledore took the locket, the Inferi attacked Harry;\nDumbledore repelled them with a rope of fire. It is also revealed that the\nInferi almost killed Kreacher after he drank from the basin to help Voldemort\nhide his Horcruxes, but having been ordered to return to his master after his\ntask with Voldemort was complete, he was able to apparate out of the cave.\nThese Inferi later killed Regulus Black when he stole the Horcrux and ordered\nKreacher to destroy it.\n\nIn Latin, the word _inferus_ (plural: _inferi_) means \"below\", often referring\nin the plural to \"the gods below\" (see _[di inferi](/wiki/Di_inferi \"Di\ninferi\"))_ or the spirits of the dead.[28] _Inferius_ is a neuter singular\nform of _inferior_ , a [comparative adjective](/wiki/Comparative_adjective\n\"Comparative adjective\") meaning \"lower\".[28][29]\n\n###\nHorcrux[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=40\n\"Edit section: Horcrux\")]\n\nSee also: [Magical objects in Harry Potter §\nHorcruxes](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Horcruxes \"Magical objects in\nHarry Potter\")\n\nA **horcrux** is an object created using dark magic to attain effective\nimmortality. The concept is first introduced in the sixth novel, _[Harry\nPotter and the Half-Blood Prince](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince\n\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\")_ , although horcruxes are present in\nearlier novels without being described or expanded upon.\n\nTo create a horcrux, a witch or wizard must first prepare the chosen\nobject[30] in a ritual which is referred to only as “too horrible to go into\ndetail about”. Following the preparation of the object, the witch or wizard\nmust then take a life, an act which splits the soul. Following that, further\ndark rituals are required in order to remove the soul shard from the maker and\nplace it into the prepared object. Once this is done, the Horcrux becomes\nimpervious to almost all forms of destruction, requiring extremely powerful\nmagic or substances to do so.\n\nOrdinarily, when one's body is killed, the soul departs for the next world.\nIf, however, the body of a horcrux owner is killed, that portion of his soul\nwhich had remained in his body will not pass on to the next world, but will\nrather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another\nwizard. If all of someone's horcruxes are destroyed, then his soul's only\nanchor in the material world would be his body, the destruction of which would\nthen cause his final death.\n\n##\nPortraits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=41\n\"Edit section: Portraits\")]\n\nIn the _Harry Potter_ series the subjects of **magical portraits** (even those\nof characters that are dead) can move, interact with living observers, speak\nand demonstrate apparent emotion and personality. Some can even move to other\nportraits to visit each other, or relay messages, or (if more than one\npainting of the subject exists) move between separate locations by way of\ntheir portraits. An example of this is Phineas Nigellus Black, who has a\npainting in the Headmaster's office and at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Many\nsuch portraits are found on the walls of Hogwarts.\n\nSome portraits are used to conceal the entrance of a room or passageway. For\nexample, the Fat Lady's portrait covers the entrance to the\n[Gryffindor](/wiki/Hogwarts#Gryffindor \"Hogwarts\") common room, and she can\nswing the portrait open when given the correct password or close to prevent\nentry. In _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ , there is a portrait of\nAriana Dumbledore in the [Room of Requirement](/wiki/Room_of_Requirement \"Room\nof Requirement\") that conceals a secret passageway to the Hog's Head. There is\nalso a painting of a large fruit bowl in front of the Hogwarts kitchen, which\nwill swing open if the pear is tickled to reveal a hidden door.\n\nPortraits are enchanted to move by the artist, but the degree to which they\ncan interact with others depends on the power of the subject.[31] Rowling has\ncommented that a portrait is merely a faint imprint of the deceased subject,\nimitating their basic personality and thought patterns. They are therefore\n\"not as fully realised as ghosts\".[32] In _[Harry Potter and the Cursed\nChild](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Cursed_Child \"Harry Potter and the Cursed\nChild\")_ the portrait of Albus Dumbledore describes himself as only \"paint and\nmemory\" and Professor McGonagall (his successor as headteacher of Hogwarts)\ncomments that, although she speaks to Dumbledore to help her in making\ndecisions, she is careful to remember that \"portraits don't represent even\nhalf of their subjects\".\n\n### Portraits in the Headmaster's\noffice[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=42\n\"Edit section: Portraits in the Headmaster's office\")]\n\nThe portraits in the Headmaster's office depict all the former Heads of\nHogwarts, with the exception of Dolores Umbridge. They advise the Headmaster\nand are \"honour-bound to give service to the present headmaster\" (according to\nArmando Dippet). Rowling has explained that portraits of past headteachers\ntend to be more realistic than most, as the subject in question usually\nimparts knowledge and teaches them how to behave before their death. The\nportrait of Snape was installed in the Headmaster's Office at Harry's\nrequest.[31]\n\n### The Fat\nLady[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=43\n\"Edit section: The Fat Lady\")]\n\nThe portrait of **the Fat Lady** covers the door to\n[Gryffindor](/wiki/Gryffindor \"Gryffindor\") Tower. She will open it (sometimes\ngrudgingly) when the correct password is uttered. She is often upset after\nbeing awoken, and is sometimes seen drunk with her best friend, Violet. The\nFat Lady has no other known name -- even the unfailingly polite Albus\nDumbledore refers to her only as \"the Fat Lady\" \\-- and it may be that she\ndoes not represent a real person but is instead an invention of her portrait's\nartist. In _Philosopher 's Stone_, she leaves her portrait in the middle of\nthe night, locking Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville out of Gryffindor Tower,\nforcing them to run across the school. Luckily for them, when they return, she\nhas returned to her portrait, allowing them to escape into Gryffindor Tower.\nIn _Prisoner of Azkaban_ , Sirius Black slashes the Fat Lady's portrait when\nshe won't let him in without a password and it is some time before she dares\nto guard Gryffindor Tower again. After her portrait is restored, she requests\nprotection in case someone tries to attack her portrait again. Thus, two\nsecurity trolls are hired. In _Half Blood Prince_ , she gets so annoyed with\nHarry's late return that she pretends the password has changed and tries to\ncall him back when he heads off to talk to Dumbledore. When Harry later\nconfirms Dumbledore's death, she lets out a sob and, for the only time in the\nseries, she opens without the password for Harry in her grief.\n\nIn the [first film](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_\\(film\\)\n\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone \\(film\\)\") the Fat Lady is played by\n[Elizabeth Spriggs](/wiki/Elizabeth_Spriggs \"Elizabeth Spriggs\"), and by [Dawn\nFrench](/wiki/Dawn_French \"Dawn French\") in the [third\nfilm](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_\\(film\\) \"Harry Potter\nand the Prisoner of Azkaban \\(film\\)\").\n\n###\nPhotographs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=44\n\"Edit section: Photographs\")]\n\nWizarding photographs of people have similar properties to magical painted\nportraits: the figures within move about or even sometimes leave the frame.\nThey appear in wizard newspapers and other print media, as well as on\n[Chocolate Frog](/wiki/Harry_Potter_universe#Magical_sweets \"Harry Potter\nuniverse\") cards.[[HP1]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone\n\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\") [Colin\nCreevey](/wiki/Colin_Creevey \"Colin Creevey\") mentions in _Chamber of Secrets_\nthat a boy in his dormitory said that if he develops the film from his Muggle\ncamera 'in the right potion', the pictures will move.[33] However, unlike\nportraits, figures in wizarding pictures cannot speak and display little\nsentience. It appears that they do have some knowledge of current events, as\nin _Order of the Phoenix_ , the family photograph on Arthur's desk shows\neveryone except Percy \"who appeared to have walked out of it\",[34] mirroring\nthe deterioration of Percy's relationship with his family. It is also\nmentioned that in a photo taken by [Colin Creevey](/wiki/Colin_Creevey \"Colin\nCreevey\") of [Gilderoy Lockhart](/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart \"Gilderoy Lockhart\")\nand Harry, Harry's picture had walked out and was resisting all of Lockhart's\nefforts to pull him back in.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Magic_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&section=45\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"FAQ jkrowling.com\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20110721042840/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19).
