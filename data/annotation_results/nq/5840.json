(c) he is removed from office by a resolution of the Assembly, of which not less than seven days' notice has been given and which is passed by the votes of the majority of the total membership of the Assembly.\n\n  * (8) When the National Assembly is dissolved the Speaker shall continue in his office till the person elected to fill the office by the next Assembly enters upon his office.\n\nThe [Speaker of the House](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_National_Assembly_of_Pakistan\n\"Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan\") is the [presiding\nofficer](/wiki/Chairman \"Chairman\") of the National Assembly. The Speaker is\nassisted by the [Deputy\nSpeaker](/wiki/Deputy_Speaker_of_the_National_Assembly_of_Pakistan \"Deputy\nSpeaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan\"). Both officers are elected from\nwithin the ranks of the National Assembly and, by current convention, are\nusually members of the majority party. The election of the two officers is the\nfirst matter an incoming National Assembly deals with, as mandated by the\nconstitution. Apart from presiding over National Assembly debates, the Speaker\nmay also assume the duties of [Acting President](/wiki/President_of_Pakistan\n\"President of Pakistan\"), if the position is vacant (in case the President as\nwell as Chairman Senate are not available).\n\nThe current Speaker of the House is [Sardar Ayaz\nSadiq](/wiki/Sardar_Ayaz_Sadiq \"Sardar Ayaz Sadiq\") and the Deputy Speaker is\n[Murtaza Javed Abbasi](/wiki/Murtaza_Javed_Abbasi \"Murtaza Javed Abbasi\"),\nboth are from the [PML-N](/wiki/PML-N \"PML-N\").\n\n##\nSessions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Assembly_of_Pakistan&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Sessions\")]\n\nThe life of National Assembly is divided into sessions. It had to meet for 130\ndays before the First Amendment passed on 8 May 1974 in the constitution of\n1973. According to this Amendment, maximum duration between successive\nsessions was reduced to 90 days from 130 days, and there must be at least\nthree sessions in a year. A session of the National Assembly is summoned by\nthe President of Pakistan under Article 54(1) of the Constitution. In the\nsummoning order the President gives the date, time and place (which is usually\nthe Parliament House), for the National Assembly to meet. The date and time\nfor the summoning of the National Assembly is immediately announced over Radio\nand Television. Generally, a copy of the summon is also sent to the Members at\ntheir home address. The National Assembly can also be summoned by the Speaker\nof National Assembly on a request made by at one-fourth of the total\nmembership of the National Assembly. If the National Assembly is so\nrequisitioned, it must be summoned within 14 days.\n\n##\nProcedure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Assembly_of_Pakistan&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Procedure\")]\n\n### Constitutional\nrole[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Assembly_of_Pakistan&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Constitutional role\")]\n\nArticle 50 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament of Pakistan shall\nconsist of President and the two Houses known as the National Assembly and the\nSenate. The National Assembly has an edge over the Senate by legislating\nexclusively on money matters. With exception to money Bills, however, both the\nHouses work together to carryout the basic work of the Parliament, i.e. law\nmaking.\n\n### Legislative\nprocedures[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Assembly_of_Pakistan&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Legislative procedures\")]\n\nThe Bill relating to the Federal Legislative List can be originated in either\nHouse. If the House passed the Bill through majority vote, it shall be\ntransmitted to the other House. If the other House passes it without\namendment, it shall be presented to the President for assent.\n\nIf the Bill, transmitted to the other House, is not passed within ninety days\nor rejected, it shall be considered in a joint sitting to be summoned by the\nPresident on the request of the House in which the Bill was originated. If the\nBill is passed in the joint sitting, with or without amendments, by the votes\nof majority of the members of the two Houses, it shall be presented to the\nPresident for assent.\n\nIf the Bill is presented to the President for assent, he shall assent to the\nBill in not later than ten days.If it is not a Money Bill, the President may\nreturn the Bill to the Majlis-e-Shoora with a message requesting that the Bill\nbe reconsidered and that an amendment specified in the message be considered.\nThe Majlis-e-Shoora shall reconsider the Bill in a joint sitting.If the Bill\nis passed again, with or without amendment, by vote of the majority of the\nmembers present and voting, it shall be presented to the President and the\nPresident shall give his assent within ten days; failing which such assent\nshall be deemed to have been given.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the Parliament may also legislate for two or more\nProvinces by consent and request made by those Provinces. If the Federal\nGovernment proclaims State of Emergency in any province, the power to\nlegislate about that province is vested in the Parliament. But the Bills\npassed by the Parliament during the State of Emergency, shall cease to be in\nforce after the expiration of six months from the date Emergency is lifted.\nNevertheless, the steps already taken under these Acts shall remain valid.\n\n##\nLeaders[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Assembly_of_Pakistan&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Leaders\")]\n\n### Leader of the\nHouse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Assembly_of_Pakistan&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Leader of the House\")]\n\nThe [Leader of the House](/wiki/Leader_of_the_House_\\(Pakistan\\) \"Leader of\nthe House \\(Pakistan\\)\") is the highest ranking representative of the majority\nparty in National Assembly usually the [Prime\nMinister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan \"Prime Minister of Pakistan\").\n\n**[List of All The Prime Ministers](/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Pakistan\n\"List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan\")**\n\n### Leader of the\nOpposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Assembly_of_Pakistan&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Leader of the Opposition\")]\n\nThe [Leader of the Opposition](/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition \"Leader of the\nOpposition\") is the highest ranking representative of the main opposition\nparty.\n\n**[List of Leaders of the\nOpposition](/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_\\(Pakistan\\) \"Leader of the\nOpposition \\(Pakistan\\)\")**\n\n##\nCommittees[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Assembly_of_Pakistan&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Committees\")]\n\nWhile recognizing the Committee System, the committees have been empowered to\ngo into all matters of the ministry. A matter can be remitted to a standing\ncommittee by the Speaker or the Assembly suo moto and without moving any\nmotion.\n\nThe committees have also been empowered to invite or summon before it any\nmember or any other person having a special interest in relation to any matter\nunder its consideration and may hear expert evidence and hold public hearing.\n\n## Composition and\nelections[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Assembly_of_Pakistan&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Composition and elections\")]\n\nThe composition of the National Assembly is specified in Article 51 of the\nConstitution of Pakistan. There are a total of 342 seats in the National\nAssembly. Of these, 272 are filled by direct elections. In addition, the\nPakistani Constitution reserves 10 seats for religious minorities and 60 seats\nfor women, to be filled by proportional representation among parties with more\nthan 5% of the vote.
