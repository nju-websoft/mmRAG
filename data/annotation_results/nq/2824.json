The screenplay was written by [Travis\nBeacham](/wiki/Travis_Beacham \"Travis Beacham\") and del Toro from a story by\nBeacham. The film is set in the future, when Earth is at war with the\n[Kaiju](/wiki/Kaiju \"Kaiju\"),[a] colossal sea monsters which have emerged from\nan interdimensional [portal](/wiki/Portal_\\(doorway\\) \"Portal \\(doorway\\)\") on\nthe bottom of the [Pacific Ocean](/wiki/Pacific_Ocean \"Pacific Ocean\"). To\ncombat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers,[b] gigantic\nhumanoid [mechas](/wiki/Mecha \"Mecha\"), each controlled by at least two\npilots, whose minds are joined by a [mental link](/wiki/Telepathy\n\"Telepathy\"). Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh\nBecket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with\nrookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju.\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\nbegan on November 14, 2011, in [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\") and lasted\nthrough April 2012. The film was produced by [Legendary\nPictures](/wiki/Legendary_Pictures \"Legendary Pictures\") and distributed by\n[Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") It was released on July 12,\n2013, in [3D](/wiki/3D_film \"3D film\") and [IMAX 3D](/wiki/IMAX_3D \"IMAX 3D\"),\nreceiving generally positive reviews; the visual effects, action sequences,\nand nostalgic style were highly praised. While it underperformed at the box\noffice in the United States, it was highly successful in other markets.[8] It\nearned a worldwide total of more than $411 million—$114 million in China\nalone, its largest market—becoming Del Toro's most commercially successful\nfilm to date.\n\nA sequel titled _[Pacific Rim Uprising](/wiki/Pacific_Rim_Uprising \"Pacific\nRim Uprising\")_ , directed by [Steven S.

Over the course of three years,\nthe Kaiju wreak havoc upon coastal cities along the [Ring of\nFire](/wiki/Ring_of_Fire \"Ring of Fire\"), such as [San\nFrancisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\"), [Cabo San\nLucas](/wiki/Cabo_San_Lucas \"Cabo San Lucas\"), [Sydney](/wiki/Sydney\n\"Sydney\"), [Manila](/wiki/Manila \"Manila\"), and [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong\n\"Hong Kong\"). Humanity responds by constructing massive robotic machines\ncalled Jaegers to combat the Kaiju threat. Each Jaeger is piloted by two or\nmore people, who are connected by a neural bridge in a process called\n\"drifting\" to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.\n\nIn 2020, the Jaeger _Gipsy Danger_ , piloted by brothers Raleigh and Yancy\nBeckett, defends [Anchorage](/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska \"Anchorage, Alaska\") from\nthe Kaiju named Knifehead. They both engage in combat, with _Gipsy_ gaining\nthe upper hand and defeating the Kaiju by blasting it with its plasma cannon.\nUnknown to them, the Kaiju is still alive. Knifehead then re-emerges, ambushes\nthem, critically damages _Gipsy Danger_ by severing its left arm, and throws\nYancy out of the cockpit, killing him. Raleigh manages to pilot _Gipsy_ alone,\nactivating the remaining plasma cannon and finally killing Knifehead.\nTraumatized by Yancy's death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program.\n\nIn 2025, the world governments decide to end funding for the continuous\nconstruction of Jaegers, in favor of building massive coastal walls, as the\nKaiju are growing more powerful, their attacks more frequent, and Jaegers are\nbeing destroyed faster than they are being built. The remaining four Jaegers\nare relocated to [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong Kong\") under the command of\nMarshal Stacker Pentecost, who plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying the\nBreach using a [nuclear weapon](/wiki/Nuclear_weapon \"Nuclear weapon\").\n\nPentecost tracks down Raleigh at a wall-construction site in Alaska and\npersuades him to rejoin the program. Traveling to the Hong Kong base, the\nShatterdome, Raleigh is introduced to Mako Mori, director of the Jaeger\nrestoration program and Pentecost's adoptive daughter. Four Jaegers remain in\noperation – the refurbished _Gipsy Danger_ , the [Russian](/wiki/Russia\n\"Russia\") _Cherno Alpha_ , the [Chinese](/wiki/China \"China\") _Crimson\nTyphoon_ , and the [Australian](/wiki/Australian \"Australian\") _Striker\nEureka_ that will carry the bomb, and piloted by father and son Herc and Chuck\nHansen.\n\nTo find a new co-pilot, Raleigh participates in tryouts, assuming Mako is\n\"drift-compatible\", despite Pentecost's protests. During their first drifting\ntest, Raleigh is distracted by the memory of Yancy's death. Mako, in turn, is\nlost in the memory of the Kaiju attack on [Tokyo](/wiki/Tokyo \"Tokyo\") that\norphaned her, and nearly fires _Gipsy_ 's plasma cannon. Mako is promptly\nrelieved of piloting duties, and Raleigh confronts Pentecost, the former\nJaeger pilot who fought and killed the Kaiju that attacked Tokyo and adopted\nMako after the battle, telling him that he is being overprotective of her.\n\nPentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb. Hermann\nclaims that the Breach will stabilize and the Kaiju will increase in number,\nbut it will allow the assault to succeed, while Newton suggests drifting with\na Kaiju's brain to learn more about them. Newton goes ahead with his plan\ndespite Hermann's protests and discovers that the Kaiju are actually\n[bioweapons](/wiki/Bioweapons \"Bioweapons\") grown by alien colonists, that\nlive in the dimension on the other side of the breach called the Anteverse,\nwho plan on wiping out humanity. With Pentecost's permission, Newton searches\nfor [black market](/wiki/Black_market \"Black market\") dealer Hannibal Chau,\nwho sells body parts of dead Kaiju, to obtain a fresh Kaiju brain to drift\nwith. However, he soon figures out that since drifting is a two-way link, the\nKaiju [hive mind](/wiki/Swarm_intelligence \"Swarm intelligence\") gained access\nto his knowledge just as he did theirs. Soon after, two new Kaijus,\nLeatherback and Otachi, emerge simultaneously to find Newton.\n\nAll Jaegers except _Gipsy Danger_ are dispatched to intervene. Otachi destroys\n_Crimson Typhoon_ , while Leatherback destroys _Cherno Alpha_ and paralyzes\n_Striker Eureka_ with an [EMP blast](/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse\n\"Electromagnetic pulse\"). Out of options, Pentecost reluctantly allows Mako\nand Raleigh to pilot _Gipsy Danger_. _Gipsy_ successfully kills Leatherback\nand Otachi, while almost destroying Hong Kong in the process. Examining\nOtachi's body, Newton and Hannibal find out that it is pregnant. The infant\nKaiju bursts out and devours Hannibal but soon dies from being strangled by\nits own umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant's brain,\ndiscovering that the Breach can only open in the presence of a Kaiju's DNA.\n\nAs Herc was injured during the previous fight, Pentecost, who is dying from\nradiation sickness resulting from piloting a Jaeger built with a nuclear core\nbefore the implementation of radiation shielding, pilots _Striker Eureka_ with\nChuck. Along with _Gipsy Danger_ , they approach the Breach. Three Kaijus\nemerge from the Breach to defend it, one being the largest ever encountered.\nThe Jaegers kill one Kaiju and injure the others, but _Striker_ is immobilized\nby the largest Kaiju. Pentecost and Chuck decide to detonate the bomb, as they\nare easily overwhelmed, depending on _Gipsy_ 's nuclear reactor to seal the\nBreach. After the explosion leaves the largest Kaiju alive, _Gipsy_ kills it\nand, considering Newton and Hermann's discovery, rides its corpse into the\nBreach. As the Jaeger reaches the other side, Raleigh successfully overloads\nthe reactor and ejects Mako and himself using escape pods. The reactor\nexplodes, killing a few nearby alien creatures and destroying the Breach,\nwhile Raleigh and Mako's escape pods surface in the Pacific Ocean. Herc, now\nthe Marshal, orders the war clock to stop, indicating mankind's victory, and\nRaleigh and Mako embrace as rescue helicopters arrive.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Hannibal [cuts his way out of the Kaiju\ninfant](/wiki/Disembowelment \"Disembowelment\"), and looks for his lost shoe.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Charlie_Hunnam_by_Gage_Skidmore_4.jpg/150px-\nCharlie_Hunnam_by_Gage_Skidmore_4.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charlie_Hunnam_by_Gage_Skidmore_4.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Idris_Elba_2014.jpg/150px-\nIdris_Elba_2014.jpg)](/wiki/File:Idris_Elba_2014.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Rinko_Kikuchi_cropped.jpg/150px-\nRinko_Kikuchi_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rinko_Kikuchi_cropped.jpg)\n\nTop to bottom: [Charlie Hunnam](/wiki/Charlie_Hunnam \"Charlie Hunnam\"), [Idris\nElba](/wiki/Idris_Elba \"Idris Elba\"), and [Rinko Kikuchi](/wiki/Rinko_Kikuchi\n\"Rinko Kikuchi\") star in the film as Raleigh Becket, Stacker Pentecost and\nMako Mori respectively.\n\n  * [Charlie Hunnam](/wiki/Charlie_Hunnam \"Charlie Hunnam\") as Raleigh Becket:\n\n    A washed-up former pilot called out of retirement by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps.[11] On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: \"I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And he was the kind of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality.\"[12] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: \"When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me out of retirement to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is.\"[13] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, _[Hellboy II: The Golden Army](/wiki/Hellboy_II:_The_Golden_Army \"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\")_.[14] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.\n\n  * [Idris Elba](/wiki/Idris_Elba \"Idris Elba\") as Marshal Stacker Pentecost:\n\n    Raleigh's commanding officer and former Jaeger pilot. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: \"This is a movie where I have had to deal with more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?\"[12] In another interview, the director said: \"I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [everything]. I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel the weight of the world on his shoulders. When I watched _[Luther](/wiki/Luther_\\(TV_series\\) \"Luther \\(TV series\\)\")_ , that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a [Rodin](/wiki/Auguste_Rodin \"Auguste Rodin\") sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that.\"[15] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians [David Cameron](/wiki/David_Cameron \"David Cameron\") and [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\"), as well as [Russell Crowe](/wiki/Russell_Crowe \"Russell Crowe\") in _[Gladiator](/wiki/Gladiator_\\(2000_film\\) \"Gladiator \\(2000 film\\)\")_ and [Mel Gibson](/wiki/Mel_Gibson \"Mel Gibson\") in _[Braveheart](/wiki/Braveheart \"Braveheart\")_.[16] Del Toro initially offered the role to [Tom Cruise](/wiki/Tom_Cruise \"Tom Cruise\"), who declined because of scheduling conflicts.[17]\n\n  * [Rinko Kikuchi](/wiki/Rinko_Kikuchi \"Rinko Kikuchi\") as Mako Mori:\n\n    Raleigh's co-pilot who lost her family in a Kaiju attack and was adopted by Pentecost. Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood.[18] Del Toro stated: \"I was very careful how I built the movie. One of the other things I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's not going to be a sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character.\"[19] Noting that the other actors were exhausted and \"destroyed physically\" by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: \"The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained… I asked Rinko her secret and she said 'I think of gummi bears and flowers.' I try to do that in my life now.\"[20] [Mana Ashida](/wiki/Mana_Ashida \"Mana Ashida\") plays Mako as a child.[21]\n\n  * [Charlie Day](/wiki/Charlie_Day \"Charlie Day\") as Dr. Newt Geiszler:\n\n    A scientist studying the Kaiju. Day stated: \"Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide a little bit of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant.\"[22] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a [celebrity chef](/wiki/Celebrity_chef \"Celebrity chef\"), with tattoos and a \"big personality\".[23] According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of _[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia](/wiki/It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\")_: \"He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both.\" Trek Buccino portrays Newt as a child.[24]\n\n  * [Burn Gorman](/wiki/Burn_Gorman \"Burn Gorman\") as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb:\n\n    A scientist studying the Kaiju alongside Geiszler. According to del Toro, Gottlieb is a \"tweed-wearing, English, [phlegmatic](/wiki/Phlegmatic \"Phlegmatic\") introvert that never leaves the lab\". The modest Gottlieb resents Geiszler's arrogance and radical behavior; the duo echo the film's theme of incompatible people functioning together when the time comes.[23] Drew Adkins portrays Gottlieb as a child.\n\n  * [Ron Perlman](/wiki/Ron_Perlman \"Ron Perlman\") as Hannibal Chau:\n\n    A [black marketeer](/wiki/Black_market \"Black market\") who makes a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, \"I actually think this character was designed to be played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [del Toro] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down.\"[25] _Pacific Rim_ marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: \"I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, you can make your own story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience.\"[15] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster.[26] In the film, Chau states he took the name from his [favorite historical figure](/wiki/Hannibal \"Hannibal\") and his second-favorite [Szechuan restaurant](/wiki/Szechuan_cuisine \"Szechuan cuisine\") in Brooklyn.[20] Del Toro drew inspiration from [Burt Lancaster](/wiki/Burt_Lancaster \"Burt Lancaster\")'s performance in _[Elmer Gantry](/wiki/Elmer_Gantry_\\(film\\) \"Elmer Gantry \\(film\\)\")_ when writing the character.[27]\n\n  * [Max Martini](/wiki/Max_Martini \"Max Martini\") as Hercules \"Herc\" Hansen:\n\n    Chuck's father and co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated the fact that he was cast as Chuck's father, being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they developed a bond while filming, \"Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend.\" Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, \"The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog.\"[28] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh \"might start to feel like _[Sons of Anarchy](/wiki/Sons_of_Anarchy \"Sons of Anarchy\") 2.0_\".[29]\n\n  * [Robert Kazinsky](/wiki/Robert_Kazinsky \"Robert Kazinsky\") as Chuck Hansen:\n\n    An Australian Jaeger pilot considered the finest soldier left in the Resistance. He and his father Herc pilot _Striker Eureka_ , \"the strongest and the fastest\" Jaeger with eleven Kaiju kills, and make up the Resistance's \"go-to team\".[30] Kazinsky, a fan of science-fiction, was initially drawn by the film's concept, \"My immediate reaction was 'Holy crap, that's cool.' In the hands of somebody else, you might sit there and go, 'Well, this might be terrible,' but with del Toro doing it, you kind of go, 'This is going to be amazing.'\".[28] Reflecting on his experience in the film, Kazinsky said in an interview, \"The most fun I have ever had in my entire life was Pacific Rim, playing Chuck was incredibly fun.\"[31]\n\n  * [Clifton Collins, Jr.](/wiki/Clifton_Collins,_Jr. \"Clifton Collins, Jr.\") as Ops Tendo Choi:\n\n    A Chinese-American Jaeger technician. Collins described his character as the \"brains\" behind the Jaegers.[32]\n\n  * [Diego Klattenhoff](/wiki/Diego_Klattenhoff \"Diego Klattenhoff\") as Yancy Beckett:\n\n    Raleigh's older brother and co-pilot. Klattenhoff joined the project to work with del Toro. Describing his character, Klattentoff stated: \"This is a guy who is looking out for his very eager, younger brother and they were enabled with this gift that gave them the opportunity to kind of save the world. Or help, at least.\"[33] Tyler Stevenson plays Yancy as a child.\n\n  * [Ellen McLain](/wiki/Ellen_McLain \"Ellen McLain\") as the voice of Gipsy AI:\n\n    The Gipsy Danger's artificial intelligence system.[34] Del Toro secured permission from [Valve Corporation](/wiki/Valve_Corporation \"Valve Corporation\") to cast McLain in homage to [GLaDOS](/wiki/GLaDOS \"GLaDOS\"), her homicidal AI character in the [_Portal_ video games](/wiki/Portal_\\(video_game_series\\) \"Portal \\(video game series\\)\").[35] The director stated: \"It was clear to me that we needed something beautiful in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on _[Portal 2](/wiki/Portal_2 \"Portal 2\")_ for a long time and I did _[Portal 1](/wiki/Portal_\\(video_game\\) \"Portal \\(video game\\)\")_ when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on.\"[36]\n\nAdditional Jaeger pilots include Charles Luu, Lance Luu and Mark Luu as the\nWei Tang triplets (China), and [Robert Maillet](/wiki/Robert_Maillet \"Robert\nMaillet\") and [Heather Doerksen](/wiki/Heather_Doerksen \"Heather Doerksen\") as\nSasha and Aleksis Kaidanovsky (Russia). [Joe Pingue](/wiki/Joe_Pingue \"Joe\nPingue\") portrays Captain Merrit, the captain of a fishing boat caught in a\nbattle between Jaeger and Kaiju. [Santiago Segura](/wiki/Santiago_Segura\n\"Santiago Segura\") plays an aide to Hannibal Chau.[37] [Brad William\nHenke](/wiki/Brad_William_Henke \"Brad William Henke\") and [Larry Joe\nCampbell](/wiki/Larry_Joe_Campbell \"Larry Joe Campbell\") portray members of an\nAlaskan construction team that Raleigh joins after retiring from the Pan\nPacific Defense Corps. [Robin Thomas](/wiki/Robin_Thomas \"Robin Thomas\"),\nJulian Barnes, and [David Richmond-Peck](/wiki/David_Richmond-Peck \"David\nRichmond-Peck\") portray [U.N.](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\")\nrepresentatives from the United States, Great Britain, and Canada,\nrespectively. [Sebastian Pigott](/wiki/Sebastian_Pigott \"Sebastian Pigott\")\nappears as a Jaeger engineer and Joshua Peace appears as an officer, Jonathan\nFoxon appears as a frantic civilian. [David Fox](/wiki/David_Fox_\\(actor\\)\n\"David Fox \\(actor\\)\") plays an old man on a beach, while Jane Watson portrays\nRaleigh and Yancy's mother in a flashback sequence.[38][39][40] Producer\nThomas Tull makes a cameo appearance.[41]\n\n## Themes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Themes\")]\n\nIn the film, a Jaeger's neural load is too much for a single pilot to handle\nalone, meaning they must first be psychically linked to another pilot—a\nconcept called \"drifting\". When pilots drift, they quickly gain intimate\nknowledge of each other's memories and feelings, and have no choice but to\naccept them; del Toro found this concept's dramatic potential compelling. The\ndirector expressed his intention that the empathy metaphors extend to real\nlife:\n\n> The pilots' smaller stories actually make a bigger point, which is that\n> we're all together in the same robot [in life]… Either we get along or we\n> die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The\n> idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers\n> of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.\n\nDel Toro acknowledged this message's simplicity, but said he would have liked\nto have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child.[27] The\nfilm's ten primary characters all have \"little arcs\" conducive to this idea;\ndel Toro stated: \"I think that's a great message to give kids… 'That guy you\nwere beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That's the guy you have to work\nwith five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work\ntogether.\" The director noted that _[Hellboy](/wiki/Hellboy_\\(2004_film\\)\n\"Hellboy \\(2004 film\\)\")_ and _[The Devil's\nBackbone](/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Backbone \"The Devil's Backbone\")_ told the same\nmessage, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.[42]\n\nThe film centers on the relationship between Becket and Mori, but is not a\nlove story in a conventional sense. Both are deeply damaged human beings who\nhave decided to suppress their respective traumas. While learning to pilot\ntheir Jaeger, they undergo a process of \"opening up\", gaining access to each\nother's thoughts, memories and secrets. Their relationship is necessarily one\nof respect and \"perfect trust\". Hunnam commented that the film is \"a love\nstory without a love story. It's about all of the necessary elements of love\nwithout arriving at love itself\".[18][43] Both Becket and Mori have suffered\nprofound personal tragedies; one of the script's central ideas is that two\ndamaged people can metaphorically \"become one\", with their figurative missing\npieces connecting almost like a puzzle.[44] Del Toro emphasized the\ncharacters' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene the way\nhe would a sex scene.[45]\n\nDel Toro, a self-described [pacifist](/wiki/Pacifist \"Pacifist\"), avoided what\nhe termed \"car commercial aesthetics\" or \"army recruitment video aesthetics\",\nand gave the characters [Western](/wiki/Western_\\(genre\\) \"Western \\(genre\\)\")\nranks including \"marshal\" and \"ranger\" rather than military ranks such as\n\"captain\", \"major\" or \"general\". The director stated: \"I avoided making any\nkind of message that says war is good. We have enough firepower in the\nworld.\"[19] Del Toro wanted to break from the mass death and destruction\nfeatured in contemporary blockbuster films, and made a point of showing the\nstreets and buildings being evacuated before Kaiju attacks, ensuring that the\ndestruction depicted is \"completely remorseless\". The director stated:\n\n> I don't want people being crushed. I want the joy that I used to get seeing\n> [Godzilla](/wiki/Godzilla \"Godzilla\") toss a tank without having to think\n> there are guys in the tank… What I think is you could do nothing but echo\n> the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile the status\n> quo is and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in\n> another realm. There is no correlation to the real world. There is no fear\n> of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, \"I'm\n> going to destroy Seattle.\" In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that\n> started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for\n> Japan to heal the wounds of that war.

While walking on the beach near [Santa\nMonica Pier](/wiki/Santa_Monica_Pier \"Santa Monica Pier\"), the screenwriter\nimagined a giant robot and a giant monster fighting to the death. \"They just\nsort of materialized out of the fog, these vast, godlike things.\" He later\nconceived the idea that each robot had two pilots, asking \"what happens when\none of those people dies?\" Deciding this would be \"a story about loss, moving\non after loss, and dealing with [survivor's guilt](/wiki/Survivor_guilt\n\"Survivor guilt\")\", Beacham commenced writing the film.[49] On May 28, 2010,\nit was reported that [Legendary Pictures](/wiki/Legendary_Pictures \"Legendary\nPictures\") had purchased Beacham's detailed 25-page [film\ntreatment](/wiki/Film_treatment \"Film treatment\"), now titled _Pacific\nRim_.[50]\n\nOn July 28, 2010, it was reported that del Toro would next direct an\nadaptation of [H.

I don't want to sound like a puny soul, but\nI really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie.\"[55] The project\ncollapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct _Pacific Rim_ the\nfollowing Monday.[12]\n\nDel Toro spent a year working with Beacham on the screenplay, and is credited\nas co-writer. He introduced ideas he had always wished to see in the genre,\nsuch as a Kaiju birth and a Kaiju attack seen from a child's perspective.[45]\nThe script also received an uncredited rewrite from [Neil\nCross](/wiki/Neil_Cross \"Neil Cross\"), who previously created the Idris Elba-\nstarring drama series _[Luther](/wiki/Luther_\\(TV_series\\) \"Luther \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ and wrote the del Toro-produced [horror film](/wiki/Horror_film\n\"Horror film\") _[Mama](/wiki/Mama_\\(2013_film\\) \"Mama \\(2013 film\\)\")_.[56]\n[Patrick Melton](/wiki/Patrick_Melton \"Patrick Melton\") and [Marcus\nDunstan](/wiki/Marcus_Dunstan \"Marcus Dunstan\") were enlisted to perform\nuncredited rewrites when their [spec script](/wiki/Spec_script \"Spec script\")\n_Monstropolis_ caught the filmmaker's attention.[57] [Drew\nPearce](/wiki/Drew_Pearce \"Drew Pearce\") also carried out uncredited work on\nthe script.[58]\n\n### Principal\nphotography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Principal photography\")]\n\n[Filming](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\") began on\nNovember 14, 2011,[59] and continued in [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\")\ninto April 2012.[60] Del Toro gave an update after the second week on filming\nfinished.[61] The film was referred to as _Silent Seas_ and _Still Seas_\nduring production.[62]\n\nDel Toro had never shot a film in less than 115 days, but had only 103 to\nshoot _Pacific Rim_. In order to achieve this, del Toro scheduled a splinter\nunit that he could direct early in the day, before main unit, and on his off-\ndays. The director worked 17 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, for much of\nthe schedule. Del Toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing\n\"looser\" movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control\nover the production: \"Everything, 100% goes through me sooner or later. I do\nnot delegate anything. Some people like it, some people don't, but it has to\nbe done that way.\"[63]\n\nThe film was shot using [Red Epic](/wiki/Red_Epic \"Red Epic\") cameras.[64] At\nfirst Guillermo del Toro decided not to shoot or convert the film to\n[3D](/wiki/3D_film \"3D film\"), as the effect would not work due to the sheer\nsize of the film's robots and monsters, explaining\n\n> I didn't want to make the movie 3D because when you have things that big…\n> the thing that happens naturally, you're looking at two buildings lets say\n> at 300 feet [away], if you move there is no [parallax](/wiki/Parallax\n> \"Parallax\"). They're so big that, in 3D, you barely notice anything no\n> matter how fast you move… To force the 3D effects for robots and monsters\n> that are supposed to be big you are making their [perspective] miniaturized,\n> making them human scale.[65]\n\nIt was later announced that the film would be converted to 3D, with the\nconversion taking 40 weeks longer than most. Del Toro said: \"What can I tell\nyou? I changed my mind. I'm not running for office. I can do a\n[Romney](/wiki/Mitt_Romney \"Mitt Romney\").\"[66]\n\nDel Toro cut approximately an hour of material from the film. The unused\nfootage explored the characters and their arcs in greater detail, but the\ndirector felt it was necessary to strike a balance, stating: \"We cannot\npretend this is [Ibsen](/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen \"Henrik Ibsen\") with monsters and\ngiant robots. I cannot pretend I'm doing a profound reflection on mankind.\"\nEach character's arc was edited down to its minimal requirements.[42] The\ndirector wanted to keep the film around two hours, particularly for younger\nviewers. [Alejandro González\nIñárritu](/wiki/Alejandro_Gonz%C3%A1lez_I%C3%B1%C3%A1rritu \"Alejandro González\nIñárritu\") and [Alfonso Cuarón](/wiki/Alfonso_Cuar%C3%B3n \"Alfonso Cuarón\")\nhelped with the editing; Iñárritu removed ten minutes of footage, while Cuarón\nremoved \"a few minutes\" and rearranged several scenes.[67] Iñárritu and Cuarón\nreceive a \"special thanks\" in the film's end credits, as do [James\nCameron](/wiki/James_Cameron \"James Cameron\") and [David\nCronenberg](/wiki/David_Cronenberg \"David Cronenberg\").[68]\n\n###\nDesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Design\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/El_coloso.jpg/220px-\nEl_coloso.jpg)](/wiki/File:El_coloso.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:El_coloso.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDel Toro drew inspiration from [Francisco Goya](/wiki/Francisco_Goya\n\"Francisco Goya\")'s _[The Colossus](/wiki/The_Colossus_\\(painting\\) \"The\nColossus \\(painting\\)\")_ , and hoped to evoke the same \"sense of awe\" with the\nfilm's battles.[52]\n\nDel Toro envisioned _Pacific Rim_ as an earnest, colorful adventure story,\nwith an \"incredibly airy and light feel\", in contrast to the \"super-brooding,\nsuper-dark, cynical summer movie\". The director focused on \"big, beautiful,\nsophisticated visuals\" and action that would satisfy an adult audience, but\nhas stated his \"real hope\" is to introduce the Kaiju and mecha genres to a\ngeneration of children.[55] While the film draws heavily on these genres, it\navoids direct references to previous works. Del Toro intended to create\nsomething original but \"madly in love\" with its influences, instilled with\n\"epic beauty\" and \"operatic grandeur\".[69] The end credits dedicate the film\nto [Ray Harryhausen](/wiki/Ray_Harryhausen \"Ray Harryhausen\") and [Ishirō\nHonda](/wiki/Ishir%C5%8D_Honda \"Ishirō Honda\"), who helped to establish the\ngiant monster genre with films such as _[The Beast from 20,000\nFathoms](/wiki/The_Beast_from_20,000_Fathoms \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\")_\nand _[Godzilla](/wiki/Godzilla_\\(1954_film\\) \"Godzilla \\(1954 film\\)\")_ ,\nrespectively.[70]\n\nThe film was to honor the Kaiju and mecha genres while creating an original\nstand-alone film, something \"conscious of the heritage, but not a pastiche or\nan homage or a greatest hits of everything\". The director made a point of\nstarting from scratch, without emulating or referencing any previous examples\nof those genres. He cautioned his designers not to turn to films like\n_[Gamera](/wiki/Gamera_\\(film\\) \"Gamera \\(film\\)\")_ ,\n_[Godzilla](/wiki/Godzilla_\\(1954_film\\) \"Godzilla \\(1954 film\\)\")_ , or _[The\nWar of the Gargantuas](/wiki/The_War_of_the_Gargantuas \"The War of the\nGargantuas\")_ for inspiration, stating: \"I didn't want to be\n[postmodern](/wiki/Postmodernist_film \"Postmodernist film\"), or referential,\nor just belong to a genre. I really wanted to create something new, something\nmadly in love with those things. I tried to bring epic beauty to it, and drama\nand operatic grandeur.\"[69][71] Rather than popular culture, he drew\ninspiration from works of art such as _[The\nColossus](/wiki/The_Colossus_\\(painting\\) \"The Colossus \\(painting\\)\")_ and\n[George Bellows](/wiki/George_Bellows \"George Bellows\")'s boxing\npaintings.[52][72] The film's designers include [Wayne\nBarlowe](/wiki/Wayne_Barlowe \"Wayne Barlowe\"), [Oscar\nChichoni](/wiki/Oscar_Chichoni \"Oscar Chichoni\"), monster sculptors David Meng\nand Simon Lee, and _[Hellboy II](/wiki/Hellboy_II:_The_Golden_Army \"Hellboy\nII: The Golden Army\")_ and _[The Hobbit](/wiki/The_Hobbit_\\(film_series\\) \"The\nHobbit \\(film series\\)\")_ designer Francisco Ruiz Velasco.[52] Del Toro has\nacknowledged that some designs created for his cancelled _[At the Mountains of\nMadness](/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness \"At the Mountains of Madness\")_\nadaptation may have been used in _Pacific Rim_.[45]\n\nApproximately one hundred Kaiju and one hundred Jaegers were designed, but\nonly a fraction of these appear in the film; every week the filmmakers would\n\"do an _[American Idol](/wiki/American_Idol \"American Idol\")_ \" and vote for\nthe best.[4] In designing Kaiju, the film's artists frequently drew\ninspiration from nature rather than other works. The director commented:\n\"Kaijus are essentially outlandish in a way, but on the other hand they come\nsort of in families: you've got the reptilian Kaiju, the insect Kaiju, the\nsort of crustacean Kaiju… So to take an outlandish design and then render it\nwith an attention to real animal anatomy and detail is interesting.\"[5] Del\nToro avoided making the Kaiju too similar to any Earth creatures, instead\nopting to make them otherworldly and alien.[73] Del Toro called the film's\nKaiju \"weapons\", stating that they are \"the cleaning crew, the cats sent into\nthe warehouse to clean out the mice.\" Certain design elements are shared by\nall the Kaiju; this is intended to suggest that they are connected and were\ndesigned for a similar purpose.[36] Each Kaiju was given a vaguely humanoid\nsilhouette to echo the man-in-suit aesthetic of early Japanese Kaiju films.[6]\nWhile del Toro's other films feature ancient or damaged monsters, the Kaiju\nlack scars or any evidence of prior culture, indicating that they are\nengineered creations rather than the result of an evolutionary system.[73]\n\nKnifehead, the first Kaiju to appear in the film, is a tribute to the plodding\nkaiju of 1960s Japanese films, and is intended to look almost like a man in a\nrubber suit; its head was inspired by that of a [goblin\nshark](/wiki/Goblin_shark \"Goblin shark\").[42] Leatherback, the bouncer-like\nKaiju which spews electro-magnetic charges, is a favorite of del Toro, who\nconceived it as a \"brawler with this sort of beer belly\"; the lumbering\nmovements of gorillas were used as a reference.[74] The Kaiju Otachi homages\nthe dragons of Chinese mythology. The director called it a \"Swiss army knife\nof a Kaiju\"; with almost 20 minutes of screen time, it was given numerous\nfeatures so the audience would not tire of it. The creature moves like a\nKomodo dragon in water, sports multiple jaws and an acid-filled neck sack, and\nunfurls wings when necessary.[4] It is also more intelligent than the other\nKaiju, employing eagle-inspired strategies against the Jaegers.[74] Onibaba,\nthe Kaiju that orphans Mako Mori, resembles a fusion of a Japanese temple and\na crustacean.[74] Slattern, the largest Kaiju, is distinguished by its\nextremely long neck and \"half-horn, half-crown\" head, which del Toro\nconsidered both demonic and majestic.[74]\n\n_Gipsy Danger_ , the American Jaeger, was based on the shape of New York\nCity's [Art Deco](/wiki/Art_Deco \"Art Deco\") buildings, such as the [Chrysler\nBuilding](/wiki/Chrysler_Building \"Chrysler Building\") and the [Empire State\nBuilding](/wiki/Empire_State_Building \"Empire State Building\"), but infused\nwith [John Wayne](/wiki/John_Wayne \"John Wayne\")'s gunslinger gait and hip\nmovements. _Cherno Alpha_ , the Russian Jaeger, was based on the shape and\npaint patterns of a T-series Russian tank, combined with a giant containment\nsilo to give the appearance of a walking nuclear power plant with a [cooling\ntower](/wiki/Cooling_tower \"Cooling tower\") on its head.[4] _Crimson Typhoon_\n, the three-armed Chinese Jaeger, is piloted by triplets and resembles a\n\"medieval little warrior\"; its texture evokes Chinese lacquered wood with\ngolden edges.[74] _Striker Eureka_ , the Australian Jaeger, is likened by del\nToro to a [Land Rover](/wiki/Land_Rover \"Land Rover\"); the most elegant and\nmasculine Jaeger, it has a jutting chest, a camouflage paint scheme recalling\nthe Australian outback, and the bravado of its pilots.[74]\n\nThe film's costumes were designed by [Shane Mahan](/wiki/Shane_Mahan \"Shane\nMahan\") and Kate Hawley, who spent several months on the costumes of the\nJaeger pilots. The Russian pilot suits are old-fashioned and echo cosmonaut\nspace suits.[52]\n\n### Visual\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Visual effects\")]\n\n[Industrial Light & Magic](/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic \"Industrial Light\n& Magic\") was chosen to create the visual effects for _Pacific Rim_.

We would time\nthe water very precisely. I'd say 'Get out of the wave [on this frame].'\"[78]\n\nThe film also features extensive [miniature effect](/wiki/Miniature_effect\n\"Miniature effect\") shots provided by 32TEN Studios, under the supervision of\nILM VFX Producer Susan Greenhow and ILM VFX Supervisors John Knoll and Lindy\nDeQuattro. Shot using RED Epic cameras on 3D rigs, the scenes produced by\n32TEN involved the creation of a quarter-scale office building interior which\nwas destroyed by the fist of a Jaeger robot which was on a separate\npneumatically controlled rig, as well as a sequence which depicted several\nrows of seats in a soccer stadium being blown apart as a Jaeger lands in the\nstadium, which was created by using quarter-scale seats blown apart by air\ncannons.

It then faced competition from _[Grown Ups\n2](/wiki/Grown_Ups_2 \"Grown Ups 2\")_ and ultimately fell behind it on opening\nday, earning $14.6 million.[103] The film reached the #3 spot during the\nopening weekend with $37.2 million, behind _[Despicable Me\n2](/wiki/Despicable_Me_2 \"Despicable Me 2\")_ and _Grown Ups 2_.

The website's consensus reads, \"It may sport more style\nthan substance, but _Pacific Rim_ is a solid modern creature feature bolstered\nby fantastical imagery and an irresistible sense of fun.\"[115]\n\n_[The Daily Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph \"The Daily Telegraph\")_ 's\n[Robbie Collin](/wiki/Robbie_Collin \"Robbie Collin\") awarded the film five\nstars out of five, likening the experience of watching it to rediscovering a\nfavorite childhood cartoon. He praised del Toro for investing his own\naffection for the genre and sense of artistry into the project in such a way\nthat the viewer found themselves immersed in the film rather than watching\nfrom afar, noting the director had catered to younger and older audiences\nalike and expressed surprise that the film could rise above the sum of its\nparts.[116] [Todd McCarthy](/wiki/Todd_McCarthy \"Todd McCarthy\") of _[The\nHollywood Reporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood Reporter\")_\ngave a positive review, describing the film as the sum of the potential every\nmonster film had ever tried to fulfill.[117] [Lou Lumenick](/wiki/Lou_Lumenick\n\"Lou Lumenick\") of _[The New York Post](/wiki/The_New_York_Post \"The New York\nPost\")_ gave the film four stars out of four, and said it had \"no shortage of\nbrains, brawn, eye candy, wit and even some poetry\", praising the \"clean and\ncoherent\" action sequences and the \"terrific chemistry\" between Hunnam and\nKikuchi.[118] [Drew McWeeny](/wiki/Drew_McWeeny \"Drew McWeeny\") of\n[HitFix](/wiki/HitFix \"HitFix\") highlighted other aspects of the film, paying\nparticular attention to the production and art design.

He said the Kaijus' civilian victims make a\n\"palpably personal impression\", deeming one scene with Mako Mori \"as\nmythically moving as anything in the mecha anime, like _[Neon Genesis\nEvangelion](/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\")_ , that\nthe director emulates with expert aplomb.\"[121] _[The Village\nVoice](/wiki/The_Village_Voice \"The Village Voice\")_ 's Stephanie Zacharek\ncalled it \"summer entertainment with a pulse\", praising its \"dumbly brilliant\"\naction and freedom from elitism, but noted the story is predictable and\nsuggested del Toro's time would be better spent on more visionary films.[122]\nAngela Watercutter of _[Wired](/wiki/Wired_\\(magazine\\) \"Wired \\(magazine\\)\")_\ncalled it the \"most awesome movie of the summer\", a \"fist-pumping, awe-\ninspiring ride\", and opined that its focus on spectacle rather than\ncharacterization \"simply does not matter\" in the summer blockbuster\ncontext.[41] [Richard Roeper](/wiki/Richard_Roeper \"Richard Roeper\") gave the\nfilm a B, commenting that either the Jaegers or Kaiju \"can take down any of\nthe [Transformers](/wiki/Transformers_\\(film_series\\) \"Transformers \\(film\nseries\\)\").\"[123] [Leonard Maltin](/wiki/Leonard_Maltin \"Leonard Maltin\") gave\nthe film two-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it \"three-quarters of a\nreally good movie that doesn't know when to quit.\"[124]\n\n_[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_ 's Andrew Pulver was less\nenthusiastic, calling the film a mix of \"wafer-thin psychodrama\" and \"plot-\ngenerator dialogue\".[125] _[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ 's [Richard Corliss](/wiki/Richard_Corliss \"Richard Corliss\")\nsaid the action was let down by \"inert\" drama, describing the film as \"45\nminutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome.\"[126] Justin Chang of\n_[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_ criticized it\nas loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films.[127]\n_[The New Yorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker \"The New Yorker\")_ 's Anthony Lane's\nverdict read as \"It is possible to applaud _Pacific Rim_ for the efficacy of\nits business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long,\nloud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an\nelephant.\"[128] The _[San Francisco Chronicle](/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle\n\"San Francisco Chronicle\")_ 's Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by\nstating \"If this is the best we can do in terms of movies—if something like\nthis can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the\ncameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up\nwith… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us _[Pan's\nLabyrinth](/wiki/Pan%27s_Labyrinth \"Pan's Labyrinth\")_ not too many years ago,\nused to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his\naffection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness.

Japanese lacks a plural form for its words, but it is often common for Japanese loanwords into English to receive English style pluralization.[4][5][6] Travis Beacham has said that he believes both \"Kaiju\" and \"Kaijus\" to be correct within the film's universe, although he prefers the former.[7]\n  2. **Jump up ^** The name of the [mechas](/wiki/Mecha \"Mecha\") comes from the [German](/wiki/German_language \"German language\") word _Jäger_ (\"hunter\"). In German, the plural form for this word occurs in the definite article rather than as a suffix to the word itself (\"der Jäger\" is \"the hunter\"; \"die Jäger\" is \"the hunters\"). As this is an English-language movie, the film specifically uses the plural \"Jaegers\".[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"_PACIFIC RIM_ (12A)\"](http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/pacific-rim-2013-5). _[British Board of Film Classification](/wiki/British_Board_of_Film_Classification \"British Board of Film Classification\")_.
