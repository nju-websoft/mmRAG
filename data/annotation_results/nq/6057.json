It\ndeveloped into a village during the 18th century and attained municipal status\nin 1950. The town takes its name from the nearby river, in which there are\nmany pools, or _kuile_.[2]\n\nKuils River is a level two administrative region, and is close to [Cape\nTown](/wiki/Cape_Town \"Cape Town\")'s wine routes.[3] It is located near the\nintersection of the\n[M12](/w/index.php?title=M12_\\(South_Africa\\)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"M12\n\\(South Africa\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\") and the\n[R102](/wiki/R102_road_\\(South_Africa\\) \"R102 road \\(South Africa\\)\").[4]\n\nKuils River is home to the Alta du Toit School for mentally handicapped\nchildren.[5] and is the birthplace of [Herman Charles\nBosman](/wiki/Herman_Charles_Bosman \"Herman Charles Bosman\") (3 February\n1905); journalist, poet and author. He is regarded as one of South Africa's\ngreatest writers (in English).[6]\n\n## Coat of arms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kuils_River&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Coat of arms\")]\n\nKuils River was a municipality from 1950 to 1996. The town council assumed a\ncoat of arms, designed by [Ivan Mitford-Barberton](/wiki/Ivan_Mitford-\nBarberton \"Ivan Mitford-Barberton\"), in 1955 and registered it with the Cape\nProvincial Administration in January 1956.[7]\n\nThe shield was divided into three horizontal sections: (1) a running buck on a\nsilver background, (2) a golden yoke on a red background, and (3) four silver\nand blue stripes with wavy edges. The crest was a bull's head, and the motto\n_Via trita via tuta_.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kuils_River&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ [\"Main Place Kuilsrivier\"](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/199020). _Census 2011_.\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Dictionary of Southern African Place Names (Public Domain)\"](https://archive.org/details/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames).
