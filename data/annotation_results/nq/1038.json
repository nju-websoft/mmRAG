It traveled 450 km.[38]  \n2017 | North Korea fired several missiles into the [Sea of Japan](/wiki/Sea_of_Japan \"Sea of Japan\") (June 8, 2017). They are believed to be [anti-ship missiles](/wiki/Anti-ship_missile \"Anti-ship missile\").[39] The South Korean military said the launches show the reclusive regime's \"precise targeting capability.\"  \n2017 | North Korea tested a new [rocket engine](/wiki/Rocket_engine \"Rocket engine\") that could possibly be fitted to an intercontinental ballistic missile (June 23, 2017).[40]  \n2017 | North Korea tested its first [intercontinental ballistic missile](/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile \"Intercontinental ballistic missile\") (ICBM) named [Hwasong-14](/wiki/Hwasong-14 \"Hwasong-14\") on July 4.[41][42] It launched from the Panghyon Aircraft Factory 8 km southeast of [Panghyon Airport](/wiki/Panghyon_Airport \"Panghyon Airport\").[43] It was aimed straight up at a lofted trajectory and reached more than 2,500 km into space.[44] It landed 37 minutes later,[45] more than 930 km from its launch site,[46] into Japan's exclusive economic zone.[47] Aiming long, the missile would have traveled 7,000-8,000 km or more, reaching Alaska, Hawaii, and maybe Seattle.[45][48][49][50][51] Its operational range would be farther, bringing a 500 kg payload to targets in most of the contiguous United States 9,700 km away.[52][53][54]  \n2017 | The 14th missile test carried out by North Korea in 2017 was another ICBM launched at 23:41 North Korea time (15:41 GMT) from [Chagang Province](/wiki/Chagang_Province \"Chagang Province\") in the north of the country on July 28, 2017. Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Boston, and New York appear to be within range.[55] The missile's reentry vehicle (RV) was seen by people in Japan as it entered the atmosphere and landed near the northernmost Japanese island, Hokkaido.[56][57] Analysis later revealed that the RV broke up on re-entry; further testing would be required.[58] The CIA made an assessment expecting adequate performance of the RV under the different stresses of a shallower trajectory towards the continental US.[59]  \n2017 | North Korea test fires three short range ballistic missiles from the Kangwon province on August 26. Two travel approximately 250 kilometers in a northeastern direction and one explodes immediately after launch.[60]  \n2017 | On August 29, 2017, at 6 AM local time, North Korea [launched a ballistic missile over Northern Japan](/wiki/North_Korean_August_2017_missile_launch_over_Japan \"North Korean August 2017 missile launch over Japan\").[61] The missile's short and low trajectory and its breakup into three pieces is consistent with the failure of a heavy [post-boost vehicle](/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle \"Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle\").[62]  \n2017 | North Korea launched a ballistic missile on September 15 from Sunan airfield. It reached a height of 770 km and flew a distance of 3,700 km for 17 minutes over Hokkaido before landing in the Pacific.[63]  \nNorth Korean rockets flown over the Japanese archipelago No. | Date | Model | Area flown over | Advance notice | North Korean claim | Satellite name  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | August 31, 1998 | [Taepodong-1](/wiki/Taepodong-1 \"Taepodong-1\") | [Akita](/wiki/Akita_Prefecture \"Akita Prefecture\") | No | Satellite launch | [Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1](/wiki/Kwangmy%C5%8Fngs%C5%8Fng-1 \"Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1\")  \n2 | April 5, 2009 | [Unha-2](/wiki/Unha \"Unha\") | [Akita](/wiki/Akita_Prefecture \"Akita Prefecture\"), [Iwate](/wiki/Iwate_Prefecture \"Iwate Prefecture\") | Yes | Satellite launch | [Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2](/wiki/Kwangmy%C5%8Fngs%C5%8Fng-2 \"Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2\")  \n3 | December 12, 2012 | [Unha-3](/wiki/Unha \"Unha\") | [Okinawa](/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture \"Okinawa Prefecture\") | Yes | Satellite launch | [Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3](/wiki/Kwangmy%C5%8Fngs%C5%8Fng-3 \"Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3\")  \n4 | February 7, 2016 | [Kwangmyŏngsŏng (Unha-3)](/wiki/Unha \"Unha\") | [Okinawa](/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture \"Okinawa Prefecture\") | Yes | Satellite launch | [Kwangmyŏngsŏng-4](/wiki/Kwangmy%C5%8Fngs%C5%8Fng-4 \"Kwangmyŏngsŏng-4\")  \n5 | [August 29, 2017](/wiki/August_2017_North_Korean_missile_launch_over_Japan \"August 2017 North Korean missile launch over Japan\") | [Hwasong-12](/wiki/Hwasong-12 \"Hwasong-12\") | [Hokkaido](/wiki/Hokkaido_Prefecture \"Hokkaido Prefecture\") | No | Missile launch | N/A  \n6 | [September 15, 2017](/wiki/September_2017_North_Korean_missile_launch_over_Japan \"September 2017 North Korean missile launch over Japan\") | [Hwasong-12](/wiki/Hwasong-12 \"Hwasong-12\") | [Hokkaido](/wiki/Hokkaido_Prefecture \"Hokkaido Prefecture\") | No | Missile launch | N/A  \n  \n## Events related to Missile\nTests[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_North_Korean_missile_tests&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Events related to Missile Tests\")]\n\n###\n2016[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_North_Korean_missile_tests&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 2016\")]\n\nOn February 7, 2016, roughly a month after an [alleged hydrogen bomb\ntest](/wiki/January_2016_North_Korean_nuclear_test \"January 2016 North Korean\nnuclear test\"), North Korea claimed to have put a [satellite](/wiki/Satellite\n\"Satellite\") into [low Earth orbit](/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit \"Low Earth orbit\").\n[Japanese Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan \"Prime Minister of\nJapan\") [Shinzō Abe](/wiki/Shinz%C5%8D_Abe \"Shinzō Abe\") had warned the North\nto not launch the rocket, and if it did and the rocket violated\n[Japanese](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\") territory, it would be shot down.\nNevertheless, North Korea launched the rocket anyway, claiming the satellite\nwas purely intended for peaceful, scientific purposes. Several nations,\nincluding the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"), Japan, and\n[South Korea](/wiki/South_Korea \"South Korea\"), have criticized the launch,\nand despite North Korean claims that the rocket was for peaceful purposes, it\nhas been heavily criticized as an attempt to perform an\n[ICBM](/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile \"Intercontinental ballistic\nmissile\") test under the guise of a peaceful satellite launch.\n[China](/wiki/China \"China\") also criticized the launch, however urged \"the\nrelevant parties\" to \"refrain from taking actions that may further escalate\ntensions on the Korean peninsula\".[64]\n\nWhile some North Korean pronouncements have been treated with skepticism and\nridicule, analysts treated the unusual pace of North Korean rocket and nuclear\ntesting in early 2016 quite seriously. Admiral Bill Gortney, head of the\n[North American Aerospace Defense\nCommand](/wiki/North_American_Aerospace_Defense_Command \"North American\nAerospace Defense Command\"), told Congress in March 2016, \"It's the prudent\ndecision on my part to assume that [Kim Jong Un] has the capability to\nminiaturize a nuclear weapon and put it on an ICBM,\" suggesting a major shift\nfrom a few years earlier.[65]\n\nNorth Korea appeared to launch a missile test from a submarine on April 23,\n2016; while the missile only traveled 30 km, one U.S. analyst noted that\n\"North Korea's sub launch capability has gone from a joke to something very\nserious\".[66] North Korea conducted multiple missile tests in 2016.[67]\n\n###\n2017[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_North_Korean_missile_tests&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 2017\")]\n\nOn August 29, 2017 United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has\ncondemned the latest North Korea Ballistic Missile Launch and termed it as\nviolation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions, as According to press\nreports, early Tuesday morning, the North Korea Ballistic Missile travelled\nsome 2,700 kilometers, flying over Japan before crashing into the Pacific\nOcean.[68]\n\nOn September 3, 2017, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a\nthermonuclear bomb, also known as a hydrogen bomb. Corresponding seismic\nactivity similar to an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 was reported by the\n[USGS](/wiki/USGS \"USGS\") making the blast around 10 times more powerful than\nprevious detonations by the country.[69] Later the bomb yield was estimated to\nbe 250 kilotons, based on further study of the seismic data.[70] The test was\nreported to be \"a perfect success\".[71]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_North_Korean_missile_tests&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Flag_of_North_Korea.svg/32px-Flag_of_North_Korea.svg.png)[North Korea portal](/wiki/Portal:North_Korea \"Portal:North Korea\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Operation_Castle_-_Romeo_001.jpg/24px-Operation_Castle_-_Romeo_001.jpg)[Weapons of mass destruction portal](/wiki/Portal:Weapons_of_mass_destruction \"Portal:Weapons of mass destruction\")\n\n  * [North Korea and weapons of mass destruction](/wiki/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction \"North Korea and weapons of mass destruction\")\n  * [Korean War](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\")\n  * [Korean People's Army](/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Army \"Korean People's Army\")\n  * [Foreign relations of North Korea](/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_North_Korea \"Foreign relations of North Korea\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_North_Korean_missile_tests&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"North Korea launches short-range missiles\"](http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/18/world/asia/north-korea-missiles/index.html).
