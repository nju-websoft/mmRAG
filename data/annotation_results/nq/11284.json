GAP insurance is the\ndifference between the actual cash value of a vehicle and the balance still\nowed on the financing (car loan, lease, etc.).[1] GAP coverage is mainly used\non new and used small vehicles (cars and trucks) and heavy trucks. Some\nfinancing companies and lease contracts require it.[2]\n\nGAP insurance covers the amount on a loan that is the difference between the\namount owed and the amount covered by another [insurance\npolicy](/wiki/Insurance_policy \"Insurance policy\").[1] Some GAP policies also\ncover the deductible.[3] This coverage is marketed for low [down\npayment](/wiki/Down_payment \"Down payment\") loans, high interest rate loans\nand loans with 60 month or longer terms. GAP insurance is typically offered by\na finance company at time of purchase. Most [auto\ninsurance](/wiki/Auto_insurance \"Auto insurance\") companies offer this\ncoverage to consumers. GAP insurance is usually paid upfront and, for that\nreason, one is eligible for a refund if he/she sells or refinances their\nvehicle.[4]\n\nThere are two ways of getting GAP coverage. The first type is an insurance\npolicy sold by a broker. The second type is a [waiver](/wiki/Waiver \"Waiver\")\nagreement sold by a Finance & Insurance Manager. The first is regulated by the\ninsurance industry, the second is unregulated.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\neither case coverage is usually the same and sold as a soft product through\nthe [car dealership](/wiki/Car_dealer \"Car dealer\"). Coverage is usually\nfinanced along with the lease/loan. Claims are subject to a total loss. The\ntotal loss is usually determined by the primary insurance company’s third-\nparty [appraiser](/wiki/Appraiser \"Appraiser\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nExclusions to GAP insurance vary by country or state. Some exclusions include\na maximum loss limit of $50,000 while others require a loan term of less than\n84 months.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] GAP is an optional purchase; however, many\nstates in the US require that a car dealership offer GAP at the point of\npurchase. Other states require insurers to offer GAP if a client requests\nit.[5] States such as Louisiana require that the purchaser sign a disclosure\ndocument as proof.[6] Although GAP is optional, some finance companies require\nGAP as a condition to obtaining a loan.[2] The [Truth in Lending\nAct](/wiki/Truth_in_Lending_Act \"Truth in Lending Act\") excludes GAP premiums\nfrom financial charges if GAP was not required by the creditor, the premiums\nwere disclosed in writing, and the consumer provides a written request for the\ninsurance.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n**UK Gap Insurance Update**\n\nIn September 2015, the FCA changed the way that Gap Insurance premiums are\nsold by car dealers in the UK.\n\nClaims ratios for GAP insurance (the amount paid out in comparison to premiums\npaid) were just 10% between 2008 and 2012, meaning that just £10.00 was paid\nout for every £100.00 paid in premiums. The poor value for money being given\nto consumers prompted the FCA to require the following:\n\n  1. Ensure dealers make consumers aware that other suppliers exist.\n  2. Delay the transaction by 4 business days.[7]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GAP_insurance&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Insurance law](/wiki/Insurance_law \"Insurance law\")\n  * [Insurance in the United States](/wiki/Insurance_in_the_United_States \"Insurance in the United States\")\n  * [GAP waiver](/wiki/GAP_waiver \"GAP waiver\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GAP_insurance&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [\"Gap Insurance\"](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gapinsurance.asp).
