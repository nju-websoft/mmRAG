(US NPS)\n\nVolcanism at Yellowstone is relatively recent, with calderas that were created\nduring large eruptions that took place 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and 630,000\nyears ago. The calderas lie over a [hotspot](/wiki/Hotspot_\\(geology\\)\n\"Hotspot \\(geology\\)\") where light and hot [magma](/wiki/Magma \"Magma\")\n(molten rock) from the [mantle](/wiki/Mantle_\\(geology\\) \"Mantle \\(geology\\)\")\nrises toward the surface. While the [Yellowstone\nhotspot](/wiki/Yellowstone_hotspot \"Yellowstone hotspot\") is now under the\n[Yellowstone Plateau](/wiki/Yellowstone_Plateau \"Yellowstone Plateau\"), it did\nhelp to create the eastern [Snake River Plain](/wiki/Snake_River_Plain \"Snake\nRiver Plain\") (to the west of Yellowstone) through a series of huge [volcanic\neruptions](/wiki/Volcanic_eruption \"Volcanic eruption\"). The hotspot appears\nto move across terrain in the east-northeast direction, but in fact the\nhotspot is much deeper than terrain and remains stationary while the [North\nAmerican Plate](/wiki/North_American_Plate \"North American Plate\") moves west-\nsouthwest over it.[6]\n\nOver the past 18 million years or so, this hotspot has generated a succession\nof violent eruptions and less violent [floods of basaltic\nlava](/wiki/Flood_basalt \"Flood basalt\"). Together these eruptions have helped\ncreate the eastern part of the [Snake River Plain](/wiki/Snake_River_Plain\n\"Snake River Plain\") from a once-mountainous region. At least a dozen of these\neruptions were so massive that they are classified as\n[supereruptions](/wiki/Supervolcano \"Supervolcano\"). Volcanic eruptions\nsometimes empty their stores of magma so swiftly that the overlying land\ncollapses into the emptied [magma chamber](/wiki/Magma_chamber \"Magma\nchamber\"), forming a geographic depression called a caldera.\n\nThe oldest identified caldera remnant straddles the border near [McDermitt,\nNevada–Oregon](/wiki/McDermitt,_Nevada%E2%80%93Oregon \"McDermitt,\nNevada–Oregon\"), although there are [volcaniclastic](/wiki/Pyroclastic_rock\n\"Pyroclastic rock\") piles and [arcuate\nfaults](/wiki/Fault_\\(geology\\)#Ring_fault \"Fault \\(geology\\)\") that define\ncaldera complexes more than 60 km (37 mi) in diameter in the [Carmacks\nGroup](/wiki/Carmacks_Group \"Carmacks Group\") of southwest-central\n[Yukon](/wiki/Yukon \"Yukon\"), Canada, which are interpreted to have been\nformed 70 million years ago by the Yellowstone hotspot.[7][8] Progressively\nyounger caldera remnants, most grouped in several overlapping [volcanic\nfields](/wiki/Volcanic_field \"Volcanic field\"), extend from the\n[Nevada](/wiki/Nevada \"Nevada\")–[Oregon](/wiki/Oregon \"Oregon\") border through\nthe eastern Snake River Plain and terminate in the Yellowstone Plateau. One\nsuch caldera, the [Bruneau-Jarbidge caldera](/wiki/Bruneau-Jarbidge_caldera\n\"Bruneau-Jarbidge caldera\") in southern [Idaho](/wiki/Idaho \"Idaho\"), was\nformed between 10 and 12 million years ago, and the event dropped ash to a\ndepth of one foot (30 cm) 1,000 miles (1,600 km) away in northeastern\n[Nebraska](/wiki/Nebraska \"Nebraska\") and killed large herds of\n[rhinoceros](/wiki/Rhinoceros \"Rhinoceros\"), camel, and other animals at\n[Ashfall Fossil Beds](/wiki/Ashfall_Fossil_Beds \"Ashfall Fossil Beds\") State\nHistorical Park. The [United States Geological\nSurvey](/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey \"United States Geological\nSurvey\") (\"USGS\") estimates there are one or two major caldera-forming\neruptions and 100 or so lava extruding eruptions per million years, and\n\"several to many\" steam eruptions per century.[9]\n\nThe loosely defined term \"[supervolcano](/wiki/Supervolcano \"Supervolcano\")\"\nhas been used to describe volcanic fields that produce exceptionally large\nvolcanic eruptions. Thus defined, the Yellowstone Supervolcano is the volcanic\nfield which produced the latest three supereruptions from the Yellowstone\nhotspot; it also produced one additional smaller eruption, thereby creating\nthe West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake[10] 174,000 years ago. The three\nsupereruptions occurred 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and approximately 630,000\nyears ago, forming the [Island Park Caldera](/wiki/Island_Park_Caldera \"Island\nPark Caldera\"), the [Henry's Fork Caldera](/wiki/Henry%27s_Fork_Caldera\n\"Henry's Fork Caldera\"), and Yellowstone calderas, respectively.[11] The\nIsland Park Caldera supereruption (2.1 million years ago), which produced the\nHuckleberry Ridge Tuff, was the largest, and produced 2,500 times as much ash\nas the [1980 Mount St. Helens eruption](/wiki/1980_Mount_St._Helens_eruption\n\"1980 Mount St. Helens eruption\"). The next biggest supereruption formed the\nYellowstone Caldera (~ 630,000 years ago) and produced the Lava Creek Tuff.\nThe Henry's Fork Caldera (1.2 million years ago) produced the smaller Mesa\nFalls Tuff, but is the only caldera from the Snake River Plain-Yellowstone\nhotspot that is plainly visible today.[12]\n\nNon-explosive eruptions of [lava](/wiki/Lava \"Lava\") and less-violent\nexplosive eruptions have occurred in and near the Yellowstone caldera since\nthe last supereruption.[13][14] The most recent lava flow occurred about\n70,000 years ago, while a violent eruption excavated the West Thumb of Lake\nYellowstone around 150,000 years ago. Smaller steam explosions occur as well:\nan explosion 13,800 years ago left a 5 km (3.1 mi) diameter\n[crater](/wiki/Volcanic_crater \"Volcanic crater\") at Mary Bay on the edge of\n[Yellowstone Lake](/wiki/Yellowstone_Lake \"Yellowstone Lake\") (located in the\ncenter of the caldera).[15][3] Currently, volcanic activity is exhibited via\nnumerous [geothermal vents](/wiki/Geothermal_areas_of_Yellowstone \"Geothermal\nareas of Yellowstone\") scattered throughout the region, including the famous\n[Old Faithful Geyser](/wiki/Old_Faithful_Geyser \"Old Faithful Geyser\"), plus\nrecorded ground-swelling indicating ongoing inflation of the underlying magma\nchamber.\n\nThe volcanic eruptions, as well as the continuing geothermal activity, are a\nresult of a great cove of magma located below the caldera's surface. The magma\nin this cove contains gases that are kept dissolved by the immense pressure\nunder which the magma is contained. If the pressure is released to a\nsufficient degree by some geological shift, then some of the gases bubble out\nand cause the magma to expand. This can cause a [chain\nreaction](/wiki/Chain_reaction \"Chain reaction\"). If the expansion results in\nfurther relief of pressure, for example, by blowing crust material off the top\nof the chamber, the result is a very large gas explosion.\n\nAccording to analysis of earthquake data in 2013, the magma chamber is 80 km\n(50 mi) long and 20 km (12 mi) wide. It also has 4,000 km3 (960 cu mi)\nunderground volume, of which 6–8% is filled with molten rock. This is about\n2.5 times bigger than scientists had previously imagined it to be; however,\nscientists believe that the proportion of molten rock in the chamber is much\ntoo low to allow another supereruption.[16][17]\n\n## Yellowstone hotspot origin\n\nMain article: [Yellowstone hotspot](/wiki/Yellowstone_hotspot \"Yellowstone\nhotspot\")\n\nThe source of the Yellowstone hotspot is controversial. Some geoscientists\nhypothesize that the Yellowstone hotspot is the effect of an interaction\nbetween local conditions in the [lithosphere](/wiki/Lithosphere \"Lithosphere\")\nand upper [mantle convection](/wiki/Mantle_convection \"Mantle\nconvection\").[18][19] Others suggest an origin in the deep mantle ([mantle\nplume](/wiki/Mantle_plume \"Mantle plume\")).[20] Part of the controversy is the\nrelatively sudden appearance of the hotspot in the geologic record.\nAdditionally, the [Columbia Basalt flows](/wiki/Columbia_River_Basalt_Group\n\"Columbia River Basalt Group\") appeared at the same approximate time in the\nsame place, causing speculation about their common origin. As the Yellowstone\nhotspot traveled to the east and north, the Columbia disturbance moved\nnorthward and eventually subsided.[21]\n\nAn alternate theory to the [mantle plume model](/wiki/Mantle_plume \"Mantle\nplume\") was proposed in 2018. It is suggested that the volcanism may be caused\nby upwellings from the [lower mantle](/wiki/Mantle_\\(geology\\)#Structure\n\"Mantle \\(geology\\)\") resulting from water-rich fragments of the Farallon\nplate descending from the Cascadia subduction region, sheared off at a\nsubducted spreading rift.[22]\n\n## Hazards\n\n### Earthquakes\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Yellowstone_earthquakes_history.svg/220px-\nYellowstone_earthquakes_history.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Yellowstone_earthquakes_history.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Yellowstone_earthquakes_history.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNumber of earthquakes in [Yellowstone National\nPark](/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park \"Yellowstone National Park\") region\n(1973–2014) [23]\n\nVolcanic and tectonic actions in the region cause between 1,000 and 2,000\nmeasurable [earthquakes](/wiki/Earthquake \"Earthquake\") annually. Most are\nrelatively minor, measuring a magnitude of 3 or weaker. Occasionally, numerous\nearthquakes are detected in a relatively short period of time, an event known\nas an [earthquake swarm](/wiki/Earthquake_swarm \"Earthquake swarm\"). In 1985,\nmore than 3,000 earthquakes were measured over a period of several months.\nMore than 70 smaller swarms were detected between 1983 and 2008. The USGS\nstates these swarms are likely caused by slips on pre-existing faults rather\nthan by movements of magma or [hydrothermal](/wiki/Hydrothermal\n\"Hydrothermal\") fluids.[24][25]\n\nIn December 2008, continuing into January 2009, more than 500 quakes were\ndetected under the northwest end of [Yellowstone Lake](/wiki/Yellowstone_Lake\n\"Yellowstone Lake\") over a seven-day span, with the largest registering a\nmagnitude of 3.9.[26][27] Another swarm started in January 2010, after the\n[Haiti earthquake](/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake \"2010 Haiti earthquake\") and\nbefore the [Chile earthquake](/wiki/2010_Chile_earthquake \"2010 Chile\nearthquake\"). With 1,620 small earthquakes between January 17, 2010, and\nFebruary 1, 2010, this swarm was the second-largest ever recorded in the\nYellowstone Caldera. The largest of these shocks was a magnitude 3.8 that\noccurred on January 21, 2010.[25][28] This swarm reached the background levels\nby February 21. On March 30, 2014, at 6:34 AM MST, a magnitude 4.8 earthquake\nstruck Yellowstone, the largest recorded there since February 1980.[29] In\nFebruary 2018, more than 300 earthquakes occurred, with the largest being a\nmagnitude 2.9.[30]\n\n### Volcanoes\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Yellowstone_Caldera.svg/220px-\nYellowstone_Caldera.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Yellowstone_Caldera.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Yellowstone_Caldera.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDiagram of the Yellowstone Caldera\n\nThe last full-scale eruption of the Yellowstone Supervolcano, the Lava Creek\neruption which happened approximately 640,000 years ago,[31] ejected\napproximately 240 cubic miles (1,000 km3) of rock, dust and [volcanic\nash](/wiki/Volcanic_ash \"Volcanic ash\") into the sky.[3]\n\nGeologists are closely monitoring the rise and fall of the [Yellowstone\nPlateau](/wiki/Yellowstone_Plateau \"Yellowstone Plateau\"), which has been\nrising as fast as 0.6 inches (1.5 cm) per year, as an indication of changes in\nmagma chamber pressure.[32][33]\n\nThe upward movement of the Yellowstone caldera floor between 2004 and\n2008—almost 3 inches (7.6 cm) each year—was more than three times greater than\never observed since such measurements began in 1923.[34] From 2004 to 2008,\nthe land surface within the caldera moved upward as much as 8 inches (20 cm)\nat the White Lake GPS station.[35][36] By the end of 2009, the uplift had\nslowed significantly and appeared to have stopped.[37] In January 2010, the\nUSGS stated that \"uplift of the Yellowstone Caldera has slowed\nsignificantly\"[38] and that uplift continues but at a slower pace.[39] The\nU.S. Geological Survey, University of Utah and National Park Service\nscientists with the [Yellowstone Volcano\nObservatory](/wiki/Yellowstone_Volcano_Observatory \"Yellowstone Volcano\nObservatory\") maintain that they \"see no evidence that another such\ncataclysmic eruption will occur at Yellowstone in the foreseeable future.\nRecurrence intervals of these events are neither regular nor predictable.\"[3]\nThis conclusion was reiterated in December 2013 in the aftermath of the\npublication of a study by University of Utah scientists finding that the \"size\nof the magma body beneath Yellowstone is significantly larger than had been\nthought\". The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory issued a statement on its\nwebsite stating,\n\n> Although fascinating, the new findings do not imply increased geologic\n> hazards at Yellowstone, and certainly do not increase the chances of a\n> 'supereruption' in the near future. Contrary to some media reports,\n> Yellowstone is not 'overdue' for a supereruption.[40]\n\nOther media reports were more hyperbolic in their coverage.[41]\n\nA study published in _GSA Today_ , the monthly news and science magazine of\nthe [Geological Society of America](/wiki/Geological_Society_of_America\n\"Geological Society of America\"), identified three fault zones on which future\neruptions are most likely to be centered.[42] Two of those areas are\nassociated with lava flows aged 174,000–70,000 years, and the third is a focus\nof present-day seismicity.[42]\n\nIn 2017, [NASA](/wiki/NASA \"NASA\") conducted a study to determine the\nfeasibility of preventing the volcano from erupting. The results suggested\nthat cooling the magma chamber by 35 percent would be enough to forestall such\nan incident. NASA proposed introducing water at high pressure 10 kilometers\nunderground. The circulating water would release heat at the surface, possibly\nin a way that could be used as a [power source](/wiki/Geothermal_power\n\"Geothermal power\"). If enacted, the plan would cost about $3.46 billion.\nNevertheless, according to Brian Wilson of the [Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory](/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory \"Jet Propulsion Laboratory\"), a\ncompleted project might trigger, instead of prevent, an eruption.[43][44]\n\n### Hydrothermal explosions\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/HotspotsSRP_update2013.JPG/220px-\nHotspotsSRP_update2013.JPG)](/wiki/File:HotspotsSRP_update2013.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HotspotsSRP_update2013.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nPath of the Yellowstone hot spot over the past 16 million years\n\nFurther information: [Hydrothermal explosion](/wiki/Hydrothermal_explosion\n\"Hydrothermal explosion\")\n\nStudies and analysis may indicate that the greater hazard comes from\nhydrothermal activity which occurs independently of volcanic activity. Over 20\nlarge craters have been produced in the past 14,000 years, resulting in such\nfeatures as Mary Bay, [Turbid Lake](/wiki/Turbid_Lake \"Turbid Lake\"), and\nIndian Pond which was created in an eruption about 1300 BC.\n\nIn a 2003 report, USGS researchers proposed that an earthquake may have\ndisplaced more than 77 million cubic feet (2,200,000 m3) (576,000,000 US\ngallons) of water in Yellowstone Lake, creating colossal waves that unsealed a\ncapped geothermal system and led to the hydrothermal explosion that formed\nMary Bay.[45][46]\n\nFurther research shows that very distant earthquakes reach and have effects\nupon the activities at Yellowstone, such as the 1992 7.3 magnitude [Landers\nearthquake](/wiki/1992_Landers_earthquake \"1992 Landers earthquake\") in\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\")’s [Mojave\nDesert](/wiki/Mojave_Desert \"Mojave Desert\") that triggered a swarm of quakes\nfrom more than 800 miles (1,300 km) away, and the 2002 7.9 magnitude [Denali\nfault earthquake](/wiki/2002_Denali_earthquake \"2002 Denali earthquake\") 2,000\nmiles (3,200 km) away in [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska \"Alaska\") that altered the\nactivity of many geysers and hot springs for several months afterward.[47]\n\nIn 2016, the United States Geological Survey announced plans to map the\nsubterranean systems responsible for feeding the area's hydrothermal activity.\nAccording to the researchers, these maps could help predict when another\nsupereruption occurs.[48]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Iceland hotspot](/wiki/Iceland_hotspot \"Iceland hotspot\") and [Iceland plume](/wiki/Iceland_plume \"Iceland plume\") describes aspects of volcanic processes\n  * [Long Valley Caldera](/wiki/Long_Valley_Caldera \"Long Valley Caldera\"), [Valles Caldera](/wiki/Valles_Caldera \"Valles Caldera\"), [La Garita Caldera](/wiki/La_Garita_Caldera \"La Garita Caldera\"): examples of other calderas close to but not related to Yellowstone.\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** USGS.
