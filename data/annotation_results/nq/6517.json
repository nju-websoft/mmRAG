[e](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:History_of_the_United_States&action=edit)\n\n  \n  \nThe **labor history of the United States** describes the history of [organized\nlabor](/wiki/Organized_labor \"Organized labor\"), [US labor\nlaw](/wiki/US_labor_law \"US labor law\"), and more general history of working\npeople, in the United States. Beginning in the\n[1930s](/wiki/Fifth_Party_System \"Fifth Party System\"), unions became\nimportant components of the [Democratic\nParty](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Democratic_Party \"History of the\nUnited States Democratic Party\"). However, some historians have not understood\nwhy no Labor Party emerged in the United States, in contrast to Western\nEurope.[1]\n\nThe nature and power of organized labor is the outcome of historical tensions\namong counter-acting forces involving workplace rights, wages, working hours,\npolitical expression, [labor laws](/wiki/United_States_labor_law \"United\nStates labor law\"), and other working conditions. Organized unions and their\numbrella labor federations such as the [AFL–CIO](/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93CIO\n\"AFL–CIO\") and citywide federations have [competed, evolved, merged, and\nsplit](/wiki/Labor_federation_competition_in_the_United_States \"Labor\nfederation competition in the United States\") against a backdrop of changing\nvalues and priorities, and periodic federal government intervention.\n\nAs commentator [E. J. Dionne](/wiki/E._J._Dionne \"E. J. Dionne\") has noted,\nthe union movement has traditionally espoused a set of values—solidarity being\nthe most important, the sense that each should look out for the interests of\nall. From this followed commitments to mutual assistance, to a rough-and-ready\nsense of equality, to a disdain for elitism, and to a belief that democracy\nand individual rights did not stop at the plant gate or the office reception\nroom. Dionne notes that these values are \"increasingly foreign to American\nculture\".[2] In most industrial nations the labor movement sponsored its own\npolitical parties, with the U.S. as a conspicuous exception. Both major\nAmerican parties vied for union votes, with the\n[Democrats](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Democratic_Party \"History of\nthe United States Democratic Party\") usually much more successful. Labor\nunions became a central element of the [New Deal\nCoalition](/wiki/New_Deal_Coalition \"New Deal Coalition\") that dominated\nnational politics from the 1930s into the mid-1960s during the [Fifth Party\nSystem](/wiki/Fifth_Party_System \"Fifth Party System\").[3] Liberal Republicans\nwho supported unions in the Northeast lost power after 1964.[4][5]\n\nThe [history of organized labor](/wiki/Labor_history_\\(discipline\\) \"Labor\nhistory \\(discipline\\)\") has been a specialty of scholars since the 1890s, and\nhas produced a large amount of scholarly literature focused on the structure\nof organized unions. In the 1960s, as [social history](/wiki/Social_history\n\"Social history\") gained popularity, a new emphasis emerged on the history of\nworkers, including unorganized workers, and with special regard to gender and\nrace. This is called \"the [new labor history](/wiki/New_labor_history \"New\nlabor history\")\". Much scholarship has attempted to bring the social history\nperspectives into the study of organized labor.[6]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Organized labor to 1900\n    * 1.1 Legality and _Hunt_ (1842)\n    * 1.2 Early federations\n    * 1.3 Railroad brotherhoods\n    * 1.4 Knights of Labor\n    * 1.5 American Federation of Labor\n    * 1.6 Western Federation of Miners\n    * 1.7 Pullman Strike\n  * 2 Organized labor 1900–1920\n    * 2.1 Coal strikes, 1900–1902\n    * 2.2 Women's Trade Union League\n    * 2.3 Industrial Workers of the World\n    * 2.4 Government and labor\n    * 2.5 World War I\n    * 2.6 Strikes of 1919\n      * 2.6.1 Coal Strike of 1919\n      * 2.6.2 Women telephone operators win strike in 1919\n  * 3 Weakness of organized labor 1920–1929\n    * 3.1 Great Railroad Strike of 1922\n  * 4 Organized labor 1929–1955\n    * 4.1 The Great Depression and organized labor\n    * 4.2 The Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act of 1932\n    * 4.3 FDR and the National Industrial Recovery Act\n    * 4.4 The American Federation of Labor: craft unionism vs. industrial unionism\n    * 4.5 John L.

In 1636, for instance, there was a fishermen's strike on\nan island off the coast of [Maine](/wiki/Maine \"Maine\") and in 1677 twelve\ncarmen were fined for going on strike in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City\n\"New York City\").[7] However, most instances of labor unrest during the\ncolonial period were temporary and isolated, and rarely resulted in the\nformation of permanent groups of laborers for negotiation purposes. Little\nlegal recourse was available to those injured by the unrest, because strikes\nwere not typically considered illegal. The only known case of criminal\nprosecution of workers in the colonial era occurred as a result of a\ncarpenters' strike in [Savannah](/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia \"Savannah, Georgia\"),\nGeorgia, in 1746.[7]\n\n### Legality and _Hunt_\n(1842)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Legality and Hunt \\(1842\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Commonwealth v. Hunt](/wiki/Commonwealth_v._Hunt \"Commonwealth\nv. Hunt\")\n\nBy the beginning of the 19th century, after the revolution, little had\nchanged. The career path for most [artisans](/wiki/Artisans \"Artisans\") still\ninvolved [apprenticeship](/wiki/Apprenticeship \"Apprenticeship\") under a\nmaster, followed by moving into independent production.[8] However, over the\ncourse of the [Industrial Revolution](/wiki/Industrial_Revolution \"Industrial\nRevolution\"), this model rapidly changed, particularly in the major\nmetropolitan areas. For instance, in [Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\") in 1790,\nthe vast majority of the 1,300 artisans in the city described themselves as\n\"master workman\". By 1815, journeymen workers without independent means of\nproduction had displaced these \"masters\" as the majority. By that time\njourneymen also outnumbered masters in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City\n\"New York City\") and [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\").[9]\nThis shift occurred as a result of large-scale transatlantic and rural-urban\nmigration. Migration into the coastal cities created a larger population of\npotential laborers, which in turn allowed controllers of capital to invest in\nlabor-intensive enterprises on a larger scale. Craft workers found that these\nchanges launched them into competition with each other to a degree that they\nhad not experienced previously, which limited their opportunities and created\nsubstantial risks of downward mobility that had not existed prior to that\ntime.[8]\n\nThese conditions led to the first [labor](/wiki/Wage_labour \"Wage labour\")\ncombination cases in [America](/wiki/United_States_Of_Amerca \"United States Of\nAmerca\"). Over the first half of the 19th century, there are twenty-three\nknown cases of [indictment](/wiki/Indictment \"Indictment\") and\n[prosecution](/wiki/Prosecution \"Prosecution\") for criminal conspiracy, taking\nplace in six states: [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"),\n[Maryland](/wiki/Maryland \"Maryland\"), [New York](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\)\n\"New York \\(state\\)\"), [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\"),\n[Massachusetts](/wiki/Massachusetts \"Massachusetts\"), and\n[Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\").[10] The central question in these cases\nwas invariably whether workmen in combination would be permitted to use their\n[collective bargaining](/wiki/Collective_bargaining \"Collective bargaining\")\npower to obtain benefits—increased [wages](/wiki/Wages \"Wages\"), decreased\nhours, or improved conditions—which were beyond their ability to obtain as\nindividuals. The cases overwhelmingly resulted in convictions. However, in\nmost instances the plaintiffs' desire was to establish favorable\n[precedent](/wiki/Precedent \"Precedent\"), not to impose harsh penalties, and\nthe fines were typically modest.[11]\n\nOne of the central themes of the cases prior to the landmark decision in\n_[Commonwealth v. Hunt](/wiki/Commonwealth_v._Hunt \"Commonwealth v. Hunt\")_ ,\nwhich settled the legality of [unions](/wiki/Trade_union \"Trade union\"), was\nthe applicability of the English [common law](/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\")\nin post-revolutionary America. Whether the English common law applied—and in\nparticular whether the common law notion that a conspiracy to raise wages was\nillegal applied—was frequently the subject of debate between the defense and\nthe prosecution.[12] For instance, in _[Commonwealth v.\nPullis](/wiki/Commonwealth_v._Pullis \"Commonwealth v. Pullis\")_ , a case in\n1806 against a combination of journeymen cordwainers in Philadelphia for\nconspiracy to raise their wages, the defense [attorneys](/wiki/Attorney_at_law\n\"Attorney at law\") referred to the common law as arbitrary and unknowable and\ninstead praised the [legislature](/wiki/Legislature \"Legislature\") as the\nembodiment of the democratic promise of the revolution.[13] In ruling that a\ncombination to raise wages was _per se_ illegal, Recorder Moses Levy strongly\ndisagreed, writing that \"[t]he acts of the legislature form but a small part\nof that code from which the citizen is to learn his duties . . . [i]t is in\nthe volumes of the common law we are to seek for information in the far\ngreater number, as well as the most important causes that come before our\ntribunals.\"[13]\n\nAs a result of the spate of convictions against combinations of laborers, the\ntypical [narrative](/wiki/Narrative \"Narrative\") of early American labor law\nstates that, prior to _Hunt_ in Massachusetts in 1842, peaceable combinations\nof workingmen to raise wages, shorten hours or ensure employment, were illegal\nin the United States, as they had been under English common law.[12] In\n[England](/wiki/England \"England\"), criminal conspiracy laws were first held\nto include combinations in restraint of trade in the Court of [Star\nChamber](/wiki/Star_Chamber \"Star Chamber\") early in the 17th century.[14] The\nprecedent was solidified in 1721 by _[R v Journeymen Tailors of\nCambridge](/wiki/R_v_Journeymen_Tailors_of_Cambridge \"R v Journeymen Tailors\nof Cambridge\")_ , which found [tailors](/wiki/Tailors \"Tailors\") guilty of a\nconspiracy to raise wages.[15] [Leonard Levy](/wiki/Leonard_Levy \"Leonard\nLevy\") went so far as to refer to _Hunt_ as the \"[Magna\nCarta](/wiki/Magna_Carta \"Magna Carta\") of American trade-unionism\",[16]\nillustrating its perceived standing as the major point of divergence in the\nAmerican and English legal treatment of unions which, \"removed the stigma of\ncriminality from labor organizations\".[16]\n\nHowever, case law in America prior to _Hunt_ was mixed. _Pullis_ was actually\nunusual in strictly following the English [common law](/wiki/Common_law\n\"Common law\") and holding that a combination to raise [wages](/wiki/Wages\n\"Wages\") was by itself illegal. More often combination cases prior to _Hunt_\ndid not hold that [unions](/wiki/Trade_union \"Trade union\") were\n[illegal](/wiki/Crime \"Crime\") _per se_ , but rather found some other\n[justification](/wiki/Justification_\\(jurisprudence\\) \"Justification\n\\(jurisprudence\\)\") for a [conviction](/wiki/Conviction \"Conviction\").[17]\nAfter _Pullis_ in 1806, eighteen other prosecutions of\n[laborers](/wiki/Laborers \"Laborers\") for conspiracies followed within the\nnext three decades. However, only one such case, _People v. Fisher_ , also\nheld that a combination for the purpose of raising [wages](/wiki/Wages\n\"Wages\") was [illegal](/wiki/Crime \"Crime\"). Several other cases held that the\nmethods used by the [unions](/wiki/Trade_union \"Trade union\"), rather than the\n[unions](/wiki/Trade_union \"Trade union\") themselves, were\n[illegal](/wiki/Crime \"Crime\").[17] For instance, in _People v. Melvin_ ,\ncordwainers were again convicted of a [conspiracy](/wiki/Conspiracy_\\(civil\\)\n\"Conspiracy \\(civil\\)\") to raise [wages](/wiki/Wages \"Wages\"). Unlike in\n_Pullis_ , however, the court held that the combination's existence itself was\nnot unlawful, but nevertheless reached a conviction because the\n[cordwainers](/wiki/Cordwainer \"Cordwainer\") had refused to work for any\nmaster who paid lower wages, or with any laborer who accepted lower wages,\nthan what the combination had stipulated. The court held that methods used to\nobtain higher wages would be unlawful if they were judged to be deleterious to\nthe general welfare of the community.[18] _Commonwealth v. Morrow_ continued\nto refine this standard, stating that, \"an agreement of two or more to the\n[prejudice](/wiki/Prejudice \"Prejudice\") of the rights of others or of\nsociety\" would be illegal.[19] Another line of cases, led by Justice John\nGibson of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's decision in _Commonwealth v.\nCarlisle_ , held that [motive](/wiki/Motive_\\(law\\) \"Motive \\(law\\)\") of the\ncombination, rather than simply its existence, was the key to illegality.\nGibson wrote, \"Where the act is lawful for an individual, it can be the\nsubject of a conspiracy, when done in concert, only where there is a direct\nintention that injury shall result from it\".[18] Still other courts rejected\n_Pullis_ ' rule of _per se_ illegality in favor of a [rule](/wiki/Rule_of_law\n\"Rule of law\") that asked whether the combination was a but-for cause of\n[injury](/wiki/Injury \"Injury\"). Thus, as [economist](/wiki/Economist\n\"Economist\") [Edwin Witte](/wiki/Edwin_Witte \"Edwin Witte\") stated, \"The\ndoctrine that a combination to raise wages is illegal was allowed to die by\ncommon consent. No leading case was required for its overthrow\".[20]\nNevertheless, while _Hunt_ was not the first case to hold that labor\ncombinations were legal, it was the first to do so explicitly and in clear\nterms.\n\n### Early\nfederations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Early federations\")]\n\nMain articles: [National Labor Union](/wiki/National_Labor_Union \"National\nLabor Union\") and [Order of the Knights of St.\nCrispin](/wiki/Order_of_the_Knights_of_St._Crispin \"Order of the Knights of\nSt. Crispin\")\n\nThe National Labor Union (NLU), founded in 1866, was the first national labor\nfederation in the United States. It was dissolved in 1872.\n\nThe regional Order of the Knights of St. Crispin was founded in the northeast\nin 1867 and claimed 50,000 members by 1870, by far the largest union in the\ncountry. A closely associated union of women, the [Daughters of St.\nCrispin](/wiki/Daughters_of_St._Crispin \"Daughters of St. Crispin\"), formed in\n1870. In 1879 the Knights formally admitted women, who by 1886 comprised 10%\nof the union's membership,[21] but it was poorly organized and soon declined.\nThey fought encroachments of machinery and unskilled labor on autonomy of\nskilled shoe workers. One provision in the Crispin constitution explicitly\nsought to limit the entry of \"green hands\" into the trade, but this failed\nbecause the new machines could be operated by semi-skilled workers and produce\nmore shoes than hand sewing.[22]\n\n### Railroad\nbrotherhoods[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Railroad brotherhoods\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Great_Railway_Strike_1886_-_E_St_Louis.jpg/250px-\nGreat_Railway_Strike_1886_-_E_St_Louis.jpg)](/wiki/File:Great_Railway_Strike_1886_-_E_St_Louis.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Great_Railway_Strike_1886_-_E_St_Louis.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Great Southwest Railroad Strike of\n1886](/wiki/Great_Southwest_Railroad_Strike_of_1886 \"Great Southwest Railroad\nStrike of 1886\") was a trade union strike involving more than 200,000\nworkers.[23]\n\nWith the rapid growth and consolidation of large railroad systems after 1870,\nunion organizations sprang up, covering the entire nation. By 1901, 17 major\nrailway brotherhoods were in operation; they generally worked amicably with\nmanagement, which recognized their usefulness.[24] Key unions included the\n[Brotherhood of Locomotive\nEngineers](/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Locomotive_Engineers \"Brotherhood of\nLocomotive Engineers\") (BLE), Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Division\n(BMWED), the [Order of Railway Conductors](/wiki/Order_of_Railway_Conductors\n\"Order of Railway Conductors\"), the [Brotherhood of Locomotive\nFiremen](/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Locomotive_Firemen \"Brotherhood of Locomotive\nFiremen\"), and the [Brotherhood of Railroad\nTrainmen](/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Railroad_Trainmen \"Brotherhood of Railroad\nTrainmen\").[25] Their main goal was building insurance and medical packages\nfor their members, and negotiating bureaucratic work rules that favored their\nmembership, such as seniority and grievance procedures.[26]\n\nThey were not members of the AFL, and fought off more radical rivals such as\nthe [Knights of Labor](/wiki/Knights_of_Labor \"Knights of Labor\") in the 1880s\nand the [American Railroad Union](/wiki/American_Railroad_Union \"American\nRailroad Union\") in the 1890s. They consolidated their power in 1916, after\nthreatening a national strike, by securing the [Adamson Act](/wiki/Adamson_Act\n\"Adamson Act\"), a federal law that provided 10 hours pay for an eight-hour\nday. At the end of World War I they promoted nationalization of the railroads,\nand conducted a national strike in 1919. Both programs failed, and the\nbrotherhoods were largely stagnant in the 1920s. They generally were\nindependent politically, but supported the third party campaign of [Robert M.\nLa Follette Sr.](/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette_Sr. \"Robert M. La Follette Sr.\")\nin 1924.[27]\n\n### Knights of\nLabor[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Knights of Labor\")]\n\nMain article: [Knights of Labor](/wiki/Knights_of_Labor \"Knights of Labor\")\n\nThe first effective labor organization that was more than regional in\nmembership and influence was the Knights of Labor, organized in 1869. The\nKnights believed in the unity of the interests of all producing groups and\nsought to enlist in their ranks not only all laborers but everyone who could\nbe truly classified as a producer. The acceptance of all producers led to\nexplosive growth after 1880. Under the leadership of [Terence V.\nPowderly](/wiki/Terence_V._Powderly \"Terence V. Powderly\") they championed a\nvariety of causes, sometimes through political or\n[cooperative](/wiki/Cooperative \"Cooperative\") ventures.[28]\n\nPowderly hoped to gain their ends through politics and education rather than\nthrough economic coercion. The Knights were especially successful in\ndeveloping a [working class culture](/wiki/Working_class_culture \"Working\nclass culture\"), involving women, families, sports, and leisure activities and\neducational projects for the membership. The Knights strongly promoted their\nversion of [republicanism](/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States\n\"Republicanism in the United States\") that stressed the centrality of free\nlabor, preaching harmony and cooperation among producers, as opposed to\nparasites and speculators.[28]\n\nOne of the earliest railroad strikes was also one of the most successful. In\n1885, the Knights of Labor led railroad workers to victory against [Jay\nGould](/wiki/Jay_Gould \"Jay Gould\") and his entire Southwestern Railway\nsystem. In early 1886, the Knights were trying to coordinate 1,400 strikes\ninvolving over 600,000 workers spread over much of the country. The tempo had\ndoubled over 1885, and involved peaceful as well as violent confrontations in\nmany sectors, such as railroads, street railroads, coal mining, and the\nMcCormick Reaper Factory in Chicago, with demands usually focused on the eight\nhour day. Suddenly, it all collapsed, largely because the Knights were unable\nto handle so much on their plate at once, and because they took a smashing\nblow in the aftermath of the [Haymarket Riot](/wiki/Haymarket_Riot \"Haymarket\nRiot\") in May 1886 in Chicago.[29]\n\nAs strikers rallied against the McCormick plant, a team of political\nanarchists, who were not Knights, tried to piggyback support among striking\nKnights workers. A bomb exploded as police were dispersing a peaceful rally,\nkilling seven policemen and wounding many others. The anarchists were blamed,\nand their spectacular trial gained national attention. The Knights of Labor\nwere seriously injured by the false accusation that the Knights promoted\nanarchistic violence. Many Knights locals transferred to the less radical and\nmore respectable AFL unions or railroad brotherhoods.[30]\n\n### American Federation of\nLabor[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: American Federation of Labor\")]\n\nMain article: [American Federation of\nLabor](/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor \"American Federation of Labor\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/AFL-label.jpg/250px-\nAFL-label.jpg)](/wiki/File:AFL-label.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AFL-label.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe American Federation of Labor union label, c. 1900.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Gompers-\nSamuel-1894.jpg/250px-Gompers-Samuel-1894.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gompers-\nSamuel-1894.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gompers-Samuel-1894.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Samuel Gompers](/wiki/Samuel_Gompers \"Samuel Gompers\") in 1894; he was the\nAFL leader 1886-1924.\n\nThe [Federation of Organized Trades and Labor\nUnions](/wiki/Federation_of_Organized_Trades_and_Labor_Unions \"Federation of\nOrganized Trades and Labor Unions\") began in 1881 under the leadership of\n[Samuel Gompers](/wiki/Samuel_Gompers \"Samuel Gompers\"). Like the [National\nLabor Union](/wiki/National_Labor_Union \"National Labor Union\"), it was a\nfederation of different unions and did not directly enroll workers. Its\noriginal goals were to encourage the formation of trade unions and to obtain\nlegislation, such as prohibition of child labor, a national eight hour day,\nand exclusion of Chinese and other foreign contract workers.\n\nStrikes organized by labor unions became routine events by the 1880s. There\nwere 37,000 strikes, 1881 to 1905. By far the largest number were in the\nbuilding trades, followed far behind by coal miners. The main goal was control\nof working conditions, setting uniform wage scales, protesting the firing of a\nmember, and settling which rival union was in control. Most strikes were of\nvery short duration. In times of depression strikes were more violent but less\nsuccessful, because the company was losing money anyway. They were successful\nin times of prosperity when the company was losing profits and wanted to\nsettle quickly.[31]\n\nThe Federation made some efforts to obtain favorable legislation, but had\nlittle success in organizing or chartering new unions. It came out in support\nof the proposal, traditionally attributed to Peter J. McGuire of the\nCarpenters Union, for a national Labor Day holiday on the first Monday in\nSeptember, and threw itself behind the eight hour movement, which sought to\nlimit the workday by either legislation or union organizing.\n\nIn 1886, as the relations between the trade union movement and the Knights of\nLabor worsened, McGuire and other union leaders called for a convention to be\nheld at Columbus, Ohio on December 8. The Federation of Organized Trades and\nLabor Unions merged with the new organization, known as the American\nFederation of Labor or AFL, formed at that convention.[32]\n\nThe AFL was formed in large part because of the dissatisfaction of many trade\nunion leaders with the Knights of Labor, an organization that contained many\ntrade unions and that had played a leading role in some of the largest strikes\nof the era. The new AFL distinguished itself from the Knights by emphasizing\nthe autonomy of each trade union affiliated with it and limiting membership to\nworkers and organizations made up of workers, unlike the Knights which,\nbecause of its producerist focus, welcomed some who were not wage workers.\n\nThe AFL grew steadily in the late 19th century while the Knights all but\ndisappeared. Although Gompers at first advocated something like [industrial\nunionism](/wiki/Industrial_unionism \"Industrial unionism\"), he retreated from\nthat in the face of opposition from the [craft unions](/wiki/Craft_unionism\n\"Craft unionism\") that made up most of the AFL.\n\nThe unions of the AFL were composed primarily of skilled men; unskilled\nworkers, African-Americans, and women were generally excluded. The AFL saw\nwomen as threatening the jobs of men, since they often worked for lower wages.\nThe AFL provided little to no support for women's attempts to unionize.[33]\n\n### Western Federation of\nMiners[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Western Federation of Miners\")]\n\nMain article: [Western Federation of\nMiners](/wiki/Western_Federation_of_Miners \"Western Federation of Miners\")\n\nThe Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was created in 1893. Frequently [in\ncompetition with](/wiki/Labor_federation_competition_in_the_United_States\n\"Labor federation competition in the United States\") the American Federation\nof Labor, the WFM spawned new federations, including the [Western Labor\nUnion](/wiki/Western_Labor_Union \"Western Labor Union\") (later renamed to the\n[American Labor Union](/wiki/American_Labor_Union \"American Labor Union\")).\nThe WFM took a conservative turn in the aftermath of the [Colorado Labor\nWars](/wiki/Colorado_Labor_Wars \"Colorado Labor Wars\") and the trials of its\npresident, [Charles Moyer](/wiki/Charles_Moyer \"Charles Moyer\"), and its\nsecretary treasurer, [Big Bill Haywood](/wiki/Big_Bill_Haywood \"Big Bill\nHaywood\"), for the conspiratorial assassination of Idaho's former governor.\nAlthough both were found innocent, the WFM, headed by Moyer, separated itself\nfrom the [Industrial Workers of the\nWorld](/wiki/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World \"Industrial Workers of the\nWorld\") (IWW) (launched by Haywood and other labor radicals, socialists, and\nanarchists in 1905) just a few years after that organization's [founding\nconvention](/wiki/First_Convention_of_the_Industrial_Workers_of_the_World\n\"First Convention of the Industrial Workers of the World\").

Discontented workers joined the\n[American Railway Union](/wiki/American_Railway_Union \"American Railway\nUnion\") (ARU), led by [Eugene V. Debs](/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs \"Eugene V. Debs\"),\nwhich supported their strike by launching a boycott of all Pullman cars on all\nrailroads. ARU members across the nation refused to switch Pullman cars onto\ntrains. When these switchmen were disciplined, the entire ARU struck the\nrailroads on June 26, 1894. Within four days, 125,000 workers on twenty-nine\nrailroads had people quit work rather than handle Pullman cars.[35] Strikers\nand their supporters also engaged in riots and [sabotage](/wiki/Sabotage\n\"Sabotage\").[36][37]\n\nThe railroads were able to get Edwin Walker, general counsel for the Chicago,\nMilwaukee, and St. Paul Railway, appointed as a special federal attorney with\nresponsibility for dealing with the strike. Walker went to federal court and\nobtained an injunction barring union leaders from supporting the boycott in\nany way. The court injunction was based on the [Sherman Anti-Trust\nAct](/wiki/Sherman_Anti-Trust_Act \"Sherman Anti-Trust Act\") which prohibited\n\"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy,\nin restraint of trade or commerce among the several States\". Debs and other\nleaders of the ARU ignored the injunction, and federal troops were called into\naction.[38]\n\nThe strike was broken up by [United States\nMarshals](/wiki/United_States_Marshal \"United States Marshal\") and some 2,000\n[United States Army](/wiki/United_States_Army \"United States Army\") troops,\ncommanded by [Nelson Miles](/wiki/Nelson_Miles \"Nelson Miles\"), sent in by\nPresident [Grover Cleveland](/wiki/Grover_Cleveland \"Grover Cleveland\") on the\npremise that the strike interfered with the delivery of [U.S.\nMail](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service \"United

prison for six months for violating the federal court order, and\nthe ARU disintegrated.\n\n## Organized

was higher than in Europe. He compares wages and the\nstandard of living in Pittsburgh with Birmingham, England. He finds that,\nafter taking into account the cost of living (which was 65% higher in the\nU.S.), the standard of living of unskilled workers was about the same in the\ntwo cities, while skilled workers had about twice as high a standard of\nliving. The American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and there was\na heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America.[39]\nShergold revealed that skilled Americans did earn higher wages than the\nBritish, yet unskilled workers did not, while Americans worked longer hours,\nwith a greater chance of injury, and had fewer social services.[39]\n\nNationwide from 1890 to 1914 the unionized wages in manufacturing rose from\n$17.63 a week to $21.37, and the average work week fell from 54.4 to 48.8\nhours a week.

In 1912 the IWW\norganized [a strike of more than twenty thousand textile\nworkers](/wiki/Lawrence_textile_strike \"Lawrence textile strike\"), and by 1917\nthe [Agricultural Workers\nOrganization](/wiki/Agricultural_Workers_Organization \"Agricultural Workers\nOrganization\") (AWO) of the IWW claimed a hundred thousand itinerant farm\nworkers in the heartland of North America.[46] Eventually the concept of One\nBig Union spread from dock workers to maritime workers, and thus was\ncommunicated to many different parts of the world. Dedicated to\n[workplace](/wiki/Workplace_democracy \"Workplace democracy\") and [economic\ndemocracy](/wiki/Economic_democracy \"Economic democracy\"), the IWW allowed men\nand women as members, and organized workers of all races and nationalities,\nwithout regard to current employment status. At its peak it had 150,000\nmembers (with 200,000 membership cards issued between 1905 and 1916[47]), but\nit was fiercely repressed during, and especially after, World War I with\nmany[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] of its members killed, about 10,000[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\norganizers imprisoned, and thousands more deported as foreign agitators. The\nIWW proved that unskilled workers could be organized. The IWW exists today,\nbut its most significant impact was during its first two decades of existence.\n\n### Government and\nlabor[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Government and labor\")]\n\nSee also: [National Civic Federation](/wiki/National_Civic_Federation\n\"National Civic Federation\"), [Injunction](/wiki/Injunction \"Injunction\"), and\n[Norris-LaGuardia Act](/wiki/Norris-LaGuardia_Act \"Norris-LaGuardia Act\")\n\nIn 1908 the U.S. Supreme Court decided _[Loewe v.\nLawlor](/wiki/Loewe_v._Lawlor \"Loewe v. Lawlor\")_ (the Danbury Hatters' Case).\nIn 1902 the Hatters' Union instituted a nationwide boycott of the hats made by\na nonunion company in Connecticut. Owner Dietrich Loewe brought suit against\nthe union for unlawful combinations to restrain trade in violation of the\n[Sherman Antitrust Act](/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act \"Sherman Antitrust Act\").\nThe Court ruled that the union was subject to an injunction and liable for the\npayment of triple damages.\n\nIn 1915 Justice [Oliver Wendell Holmes](/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Jr.\n\"Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\"), speaking for the Court, again decided in favor\nof Loewe, upholding a lower federal court ruling ordering the union to pay\ndamages of $252,130. (The cost of lawyers had already exceeded $100,000, paid\nby the AFL). This was not a typical case in which a few union leaders were\npunished with short terms in jail; specifically, the life savings of several\nhundreds of the members were attached. The lower court ruling established a\nmajor precedent, and became a serious issue for the unions.\n\nThe [Clayton Act of 1914](/wiki/Clayton_Antitrust_Act \"Clayton Antitrust Act\")\npresumably exempted unions from the antitrust prohibition and established for\nthe first time the Congressional principle that \"the labor of a human being is\nnot a commodity or article of commerce\". However, judicial interpretation so\nweakened it that prosecutions of labor under the antitrust acts continued\nuntil the enactment of the [Norris-La Guardia Act](/wiki/Norris-La_Guardia_Act\n\"Norris-La Guardia Act\") in 1932.\n\n  * _[Loewe v.

To keep\nfactories running smoothly, Wilson established the National War Labor Board in\n1918, which forced management to negotiate with existing unions.[49] The AFL\nunions and the railway brotherhoods strongly encouraged their young men to\nenlist in the military. They fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and\nslow war production by the anti-war IWW and left-wing Socialists. President\nWilson appointed Gompers to the powerful [Council of National\nDefense](/wiki/Council_of_National_Defense \"Council of National Defense\"),\nwhere he set up the War Committee on Labor. The AFL membership soared to 2.4\nmillion in 1917. Anti-war socialists controlled the\n[IWW](/wiki/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World \"Industrial Workers of the\nWorld\"), which fought against the war effort and was in turn shut down by\nlegal action by the federal government.[50]\n\n### Strikes of\n1919[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Strikes of 1919\")]\n\nIn 1919, the AFL tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of\nmajor strikes in meat, steel,[51] and many other industries. Management\ncounterattacked, claiming that key strikes were run by Communists intent on\ndestroying capitalism.[52] Nearly all the strikes ultimately failed, forcing\nunions back to positions similar to those around 1910.[53]\n\n#### Coal Strike of\n1919[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Coal Strike of 1919\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Keeping_warm.jpg)](/wiki/File:Keeping_warm.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Keeping_warm.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Keeping Warm\", the _[Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles\nTimes\")_ , a conservative newspaper, demands federal action to stop the coal\nstrike, November 22, 1919\n\nThe [United Mine Workers](/wiki/United_Mine_Workers \"United Mine Workers\")\nunder [John L. Lewis](/wiki/John_L._Lewis \"John L.

U.S. Attorney General [A. Mitchell\nPalmer](/wiki/A._Mitchell_Palmer \"A. Mitchell Palmer\") invoked the [Lever\nAct](/wiki/Food_and_Fuel_Control_Act \"Food and Fuel Control Act\"), a wartime\nmeasure that made it a crime to interfere with the production or\ntransportation of necessities. Ignoring the court order 400,000 coal workers\nwalked out. The coal operators played the radical card, saying Lenin and\nTrotsky had ordered the strike and were financing it, and some of the press\nechoed that language.[55]\n\nLewis, facing criminal charges and sensitive to the propaganda campaign,\nwithdrew his strike call. Lewis did not fully control the faction-ridden UAW\nand many locals ignored his call.[56] As the strike dragged on into its third\nweek, supplies of the nation's main fuel were running low and the public\ncalled for ever stronger government action. Final agreement came after five\nweeks with the miners getting a 14% raise, far less than they wanted.[57][58]\n\n#### Women telephone operators win strike in\n1919[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Women telephone operators win strike in 1919\")]\n\nOne important strike was won by labor. Moved to action by the rising cost of\nliving, the president of the Boston Telephone Operator's Union, Julia\nO'Connor, asked for higher wages from the [New England\nTelephone](/wiki/Verizon_New_England \"Verizon New England\") Company. Wages of\noperators averaged a third less than women in manufacturing.[59] In April,\n9,000 women operators in New England went on strike, shutting down most\ntelephone service. The company hired college students as strikebreakers, but\nthey came under violent attack by men supporting the strikers. In a few days a\nsettlement was reached giving higher wages. After the success O'Connor began a\nnational campaign to organize women operators.[59]\n\n## Weakness of organized labor\n1920–1929[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Weakness of organized labor 1920–1929\")]\n\nThe 1920s marked a period of sharp decline for the labor movement. Union\nmembership and activities fell sharply in the face of economic prosperity, a\nlack of leadership within the movement, and anti-union sentiments from both\nemployers and the government. The unions were much less able to organize\nstrikes. In 1919, more than 4 million workers (or 21 percent of the labor\nforce) participated in about 3,600 strikes. In contrast, 1929 witnessed about\n289,000 workers (or 1.2 percent of the labor force) stage only 900\nstrikes.[60]\n\nAfter a short recession in 1920, the 1920s was a generally prosperous decade\noutside of farming and coal mining. The GNP growth 1921-29 was a very strong\n6.0%, double the long-term average of about 3%.[61] Real annual earnings (in\n1914 dollars) for all employees (deducting for unemployment) was $566 in 1921\nand $793 in 1929, a real gain of 40%.[62] The economic prosperity of the\ndecade led to stable prices, eliminating one major incentive to join\nunions.[63] Unemployment fell from 11.7% in 1921 to 2.4% in 1923 and remained\nin the range of 2%-5% until 1930.[64]\n\nThe 1920s also saw a lack of strong leadership within the labor movement.\n[Samuel Gompers](/wiki/Samuel_Gompers \"Samuel Gompers\") of the [American\nFederation of Labor](/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor \"American Federation\nof Labor\") died in 1924 after serving as the organization's president for 37\nyears. Observers said successor William Green, who was the secretary-treasurer\nof the [United Mine Workers](/wiki/United_Mine_Workers \"United Mine Workers\"),\n\"lacked the aggressiveness and the imagination of the AFL's first\npresident\".[65] The AFL was down to less than 3 million members in 1925 after\nhitting a peak of 4 million members in 1920.[66]\n\nEmployers across the nation led a successful campaign against unions known as\nthe \"American Plan\", which sought to depict unions as \"alien\" to the nation's\nindividualistic spirit.[67] In addition, some employers, like the [National\nAssociation of Manufacturers](/wiki/National_Association_of_Manufacturers\n\"National Association of Manufacturers\"), used [Red Scare](/wiki/Red_Scare\n\"Red Scare\") tactics to discredit unionism by linking them to subversive\nactivities.[68]\n\nU.S. courts were less hospitable to union activities during the 1920s than in\nthe past. In this decade, corporations used twice as many court injunctions\nagainst strikes than any comparable period. In addition, the practice of\nforcing employees (by threat of termination) to sign [yellow-dog\ncontracts](/wiki/Yellow-dog_contract \"Yellow-dog contract\") that said they\nwould not join a union was not outlawed until 1932.[68]\n\nAlthough the labor movement fell in prominence during the 1920s, the [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\") would ultimately bring\nit back to life.\n\n### Great Railroad Strike of\n1922[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Great Railroad Strike of 1922\")]\n\nThe [Great Railroad Strike of 1922](/wiki/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1922 \"Great\nRailroad Strike of 1922\"), a nationwide railroad shop workers strike, began on\nJuly 1. The immediate cause of the strike was the Railroad Labor Board's\nannouncement that hourly wages for railway repair and maintenance workers\nwould be cut by seven cents on July 1. This cut, which represented an average\n12% wage decrease for the affected workers, prompted a shop workers vote on\nwhether or not to strike. The operators' union did not join in the strike, and\nthe railroads employed strikebreakers to fill three-fourths of the roughly\n400,000 vacated positions, increasing hostilities between the railroads and\nthe striking workers.[69]\n\nOn September 1, a federal judge issued the sweeping \"Daugherty Injunction\"\nagainst striking, assembling, and picketing. Unions bitterly resented the\ninjunction; a few sympathy strikes shut down some railroads completely. The\nstrike eventually died out as many shopmen made deals with the railroads on\nthe local level. The often unpalatable concessions—coupled with memories of\nthe violence and tension during the strike—soured relations between the\nrailroads and the shopmen for years.[69]\n\n## Organized labor\n1929–1955[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Organized labor 1929–1955\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Battle_strike_1934.jpg/250px-\nBattle_strike_1934.jpg)](/wiki/File:Battle_strike_1934.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Battle_strike_1934.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOpen battle between striking teamsters armed with pipes and the police in the\nstreets of [Minneapolis](/wiki/Minneapolis \"Minneapolis\") in June 1934.\n\n### The Great Depression and organized\nlabor[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: The Great Depression and organized labor\")]\n\nThe stock market crashed in October 1929, and ushered in the [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\"). By the winter of\n1932–33, the economy was so perilous that the unemployment rate hit the 25\npercent mark.[70] Unions lost members during this time because laborers could\nnot afford to pay their dues and furthermore, numerous strikes against wage\ncuts left the unions impoverished: \"one might have expected a reincarnation of\norganizations seeking to overthrow the capitalistic system that was now\nperforming so poorly. Some workers did indeed turn to such radical movements\nas the Communist Party, but, in general, the nation seemed to have been\nshocked into inaction\".[71]\n\nThough unions were not acting yet, cities across the nation witnessed local\nand spontaneous marches by frustrated relief applicants. In March 1930,\nhundreds of thousands of unemployed workers marched through New York City,\nDetroit, Washington, San Francisco and other cities in a mass protest\norganized by the Communist Party's [Unemployed\nCouncils](/wiki/Unemployed_Councils \"Unemployed Councils\"). In 1931, more than\n400 relief protests erupted in Chicago and that number grew to 550 in\n1932.[70]\n\nThe leadership behind these organizations often came from radical groups like\nCommunist and Socialist parties, who wanted to organize \"unfocused\nneighborhood militancy into organized popular defense organizations\".[70]\n\n### The Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act of\n1932[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: The Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act of 1932\")]\n\nOrganized labor became more active in 1932, with the passage of the Norris-La\nGuardia Act. On March 23, 1932, Republican President [Herbert\nHoover](/wiki/Herbert_Hoover \"Herbert Hoover\") signed the [Norris-La Guardia\nAct](/wiki/Norris-La_Guardia_Act \"Norris-La Guardia Act\"), marking the first\nof many pro-union bills that Washington would pass in the 1930s.[66] Also\nknown as the Anti-Injunction Bill, it offered procedural and substantive\nprotections against the easy issuance of court injunctions during labor\ndisputes, which had limited union behavior in the 1920s.[72] Although the act\nonly applied to [federal courts](/wiki/United_States_federal_courts \"United\nStates federal courts\"), numerous states would pass similar acts in the\nfuture. Additionally, the act outlawed [yellow-dog contracts](/wiki/Yellow-\ndog_contract \"Yellow-dog contract\"), which were documents some employers\nforced their employees to sign to ensure they would not join a union;\nemployees who refused to sign were terminated from their jobs.[73]\n\nThe passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act signified a victory for the [American\nFederation of Labor](/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor \"American Federation\nof Labor\"), which had been lobbying Congress to pass it for slightly more than\nfive years.[66] It also marked a large change in public policy. Up until the\npassage of this act, the collective bargaining rights of workers were severely\nhampered by judicial control.[74]\n\n### FDR and the National Industrial Recovery\nAct[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: FDR and the National Industrial Recovery Act\")]\n\nPresident [Franklin D. Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D.\nRoosevelt\") took office on March 4, 1933, and immediately began implementing\nprograms to alleviate the economic crisis. In June, he passed the [National\nIndustrial Recovery Act](/wiki/National_Industrial_Recovery_Act \"National\nIndustrial Recovery Act\"), which gave workers the right to organize into\nunions.[66] Though it contained other provisions, like minimum wage and\nmaximum hours, its most significant passage was, \"Employees shall have the\nright to organize and bargain collectively through representative of their own\nchoosing, and shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of\nemployers.\"[75]\n\nThis portion, which was known as Section 7(a), was symbolic to workers in the\nUnited States because it stripped employers of their rights to either coerce\nthem or refuse to bargain with them.[72] While no power of enforcement was\nwritten into the law, it \"recognized the rights of the industrial working\nclass in the United States\".[76]\n\nAlthough the National Industrial Recovery Act was ultimately deemed\nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935 and replaced by the [Wagner\nAct](/wiki/Wagner_Act \"Wagner Act\") two months after that, it fueled workers\nto join unions and strengthened those organizations.[66]\n\nIn response to both the [Norris-La Guardia Act](/wiki/Norris-La_Guardia_Act\n\"Norris-La Guardia Act\") and the NIRA, workers who were previously unorganized\nin a number of industries—such as rubber workers, oil and gas workers and\nservice workers—began to look for organizations that would allow them to band\ntogether.[76] The NIRA strengthened workers' resolve to unionize and instead\nof participating in unemployment or hunger marches, they started to\nparticipate in strikes for union recognition in various industries\".[77] In\n1933, the number of work stoppages jumped to 1,695, double its figure from\n1932. In 1934, 1,865 strikes occurred, involving more than 1.4 million\nworkers.[75]\n\nThe elections of 1934 might have reflected the \"radical upheaval sweeping the\ncountry\", as Roosevelt won the greatest majority either party ever held in the\nSenate and 322 Democrats won seats in the [United States House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\") versus 103 Republicans. It is possible that \"the\ngreat [social movement](/wiki/Social_movement \"Social movement\") from below\nthus strengthened the independence of the executive branch of government\".[76]\n\nDespite the impact of such changes on the United States' political structure\nand on workers' empowerment, some scholars have criticized the impacts of\nthese policies from a classical economic perspective. Cole and Ohanian (2004)\nfind that the New Deal's pro-labor policies are an important factor in\nexplaining the weak recovery from the Great Depression and the rise in real\nwages in some industrial sectors during this time.[78]\n\n### The American Federation of Labor: craft unionism vs. industrial\nunionism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: The American Federation of Labor: craft unionism vs. industrial\nunionism\")]\n\nThe AFL was growing rapidly, from 2.1 million members in 1933 to 3.4 million\nin 1936. But it was experiencing severe internal stresses regarding how to\norganize new members.[79] Traditionally, the AFL organized unions by craft\nrather than industry, where electricians or stationary engineers would form\ntheir own skill-oriented unions, rather than join a large automobile-making\nunion. Most AFL leaders, including president [William\nGreen](/wiki/William_Green_\\(labor_leader\\) \"William Green \\(labor leader\\)\"),\nwere reluctant to shift from the organization's longstanding [craft\nunionism](/wiki/Craft_unionism \"Craft unionism\") and started to clash with\nother leaders within the organization, such as [John L.\nLewis](/wiki/John_L._Lewis \"John L. Lewis\").[72]\n\nThe issue came up at the annual AFL convention in San Francisco in 1934 and\n1935, but the majority voted against a shift to [industrial\nunionism](/wiki/Industrial_unionism \"Industrial unionism\") both years. After\nthe defeat at the 1935 convention, nine leaders from the industrial faction\nled by Lewis met and organized the Committee for Industrial Organization\nwithin the AFL to \"encourage and promote organization of workers in the mass\nproduction industries\" for \"educational and advisory\" functions.[72]\n\nThe CIO, which later changed its name to the [Congress of Industrial\nOrganizations](/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations \"Congress of\nIndustrial Organizations\") (CIO), formed unions with the hope of bringing them\ninto the AFL, but the AFL refused to extend full membership privileges to CIO\nunions. In 1938, the AFL expelled the CIO and its million members, and they\nformed a rival federation.[80] The two federations fought it out for\nmembership; while both supported Roosevelt and the New Deal, the CIO was\nfurther to the left, while the AFL had close ties to the big city machines.\n\n### John L. Lewis and the\nCIO[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: John L. Lewis and the CIO\")]\n\n[John L. Lewis](/wiki/John_Llewellyn_Lewis \"John Llewellyn Lewis\") (1880–1969)\nwas the president of the [United Mine Workers of\nAmerica](/wiki/United_Mine_Workers_of_America \"United Mine Workers of\nAmerica\") (UMW) from 1920 to 1960, and the driving force behind the founding\nof the [Congress of Industrial\nOrganizations](/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations \"Congress of\nIndustrial Organizations\") (CIO). Using UMW organizers the new CIO established\nthe [United Steel Workers of America](/wiki/United_Steel_Workers_of_America\n\"United Steel Workers of America\") (USWA) and organized millions of other\nindustrial workers in the 1930s.[81]\n\nLewis threw his support behind [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\") (FDR) at the\noutset of the [New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\"). After the passage of the\n[Wagner Act](/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act \"National Labor Relations\nAct\") in 1935, Lewis traded on the tremendous appeal that Roosevelt had with\nworkers in those days, sending organizers into the coal fields to tell workers\n\"The President wants you to join the Union.\" His UMW was one of FDR's main\nfinancial supporters in 1936, contributing over $500,000.[82]\n\nLewis expanded his base by organizing the so-called \"captive mines\", those\nheld by the steel producers such as [U.S. Steel](/wiki/U.S._Steel \"U.S.\nSteel\"). That required in turn organizing the steel industry, which had\ndefeated union organizing drives in 1892 and 1919 and which had resisted all\norganizing efforts since then fiercely. The task of organizing steelworkers,\non the other hand, put Lewis at odds with the AFL, which looked down on both\nindustrial workers and the industrial unions that represented all workers in a\nparticular industry, rather than just those in a particular skilled trade or\ncraft.\n\nLewis was the first president of the Committee of Industrial Organizations.\nLewis, in fact, was the CIO: his UMWA provided the great bulk of the financial\nresources that the CIO poured into organizing drives by the [United Automobile\nWorkers](/wiki/United_Automobile_Workers \"United Automobile Workers\") (UAW),\nthe USWA, the Textile Workers Union and other newly formed or struggling\nunions. Lewis hired back many of the people he had exiled from the UMWA in the\n1920s to lead the CIO and placed his protégé [Philip\nMurray](/wiki/Philip_Murray \"Philip Murray\") at the head of the [Steel Workers\nOrganizing Committee](/wiki/Steel_Workers_Organizing_Committee \"Steel Workers\nOrganizing Committee\").\n\nThe most dramatic success was [the 1936-7 sit-down strike](/wiki/Flint_Sit-\nDown_Strike \"Flint Sit-Down Strike\") that paralyzed General Motors. It enabled\nCIO unionization of GM and the main automobile firms (except Ford, which held\nout for a few years).[83] However it had negative ramifications, as the Gallup\nPoll reported, \"More than anything else the use of the sit-down strike\nalienated the sympathies of the middle classes\".[84]\n\nThe CIO's actual membership (as opposed to publicity figures) was 2,850,000\nfor February 1942. This included 537,000 members of the auto workers (UAW),\nnearly 500,000 Steel Workers, almost 300,000 members of the Amalgamated\nClothing Workers, about 180,000 Electrical Workers, and about 100,000 Rubber\nWorkers. The CIO also included 550,000 members of the United Mine Workers,\nwhich did not formally withdraw from the CIO until later in the year. The\nremaining membership of 700,000 was scattered among thirty-odd smaller\nunions.[85]\n\nHistorians of the union movement in the 1930s have tried to explain its\nremarkable success in terms of the rank and file—what motivated them to\nsuddenly rally around leaders (such as John L. Lewis) who had been around for\ndecades with little success. Why was the militancy of the mid-1930s so short\nlived?[86][87][88]\n\n### Upsurge in World War\nII[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Upsurge in World War II\")]\n\nThe war mobilization dramatically expanded union membership, from 8.7 million\nin 1940 to over 14.3 million in 1945, about 36% of the work force. For the\nfirst time large numbers of women factory workers were enrolled. Both the AFL\nand CIO supported Roosevelt in 1940 and 1944, with 75% or more of their votes,\nmillions of dollars, and tens of thousands of precinct workers.[89][90]\n\nHowever, Lewis opposed Roosevelt on foreign policy grounds in 1940. He took\nthe Mine Workers out of the CIO and rejoined the AFL. All labor unions\nstrongly supported the war effort after June 1941 (when Germany invaded the\nSoviet Union). Left-wing activists crushed wildcat strikes. Nonetheless, Lewis\nrealized that he had enormous leverage. In 1943, the middle of the war, when\nthe rest of labor was observing a policy against strikes, Lewis led the miners\nout on a twelve-day strike for higher wages. The bipartisan [Conservative\ncoalition](/wiki/Conservative_coalition \"Conservative coalition\") in Congress\npassed anti-union legislation over liberal opposition, most notably the [Taft-\nHartley Act](/wiki/Taft-Hartley_Act \"Taft-Hartley Act\") of 1947.[91]\n\nA statistical analysis of the AFL and CIO national and local leaders in 1945\nshows that opportunity for advancement in the labor movement was wide open. In\ncontrast with other elites, the labor leaders did not come from established\n[WASP](/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant \"White Anglo-Saxon Protestant\")\nfamilies with rich, well-educated backgrounds. Indeed, they closely resembled\nthe overall national population of adult men, with fewer from the South and\nfrom farm backgrounds. The union leaders were heavily Democratic. The newer\nCIO had a younger leadership, and one more involved with third parties, and\nless involved with local civic activities. Otherwise the AFL and CIO leaders\nwere quite similar in background.[92]\n\n### Walter Reuther and\nUAW[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Walter Reuther and UAW\")]\n\nThe [Flint Sit-Down Strike](/wiki/Flint_Sit-Down_Strike \"Flint Sit-Down\nStrike\") of 1936–37 was the decisive event in the formation of the [United\nAuto Workers Union](/wiki/United_Auto_Workers_Union \"United Auto Workers\nUnion\") (UAW). During the war [Walter Reuther](/wiki/Walter_Reuther \"Walter\nReuther\") took control of the UAW, and soon led major strikes in 1946. He\nousted the Communists from the positions of power, especially at the Ford\nlocal.\n\nHe was one of the most articulate and energetic leaders of the CIO, and of the\nmerged [AFL-CIO](/wiki/AFL-CIO \"AFL-CIO\"). Using brilliant negotiating tactics\nhe leveraged high profits for the Big Three automakers into higher wages and\nsuperior benefits for UAW members.\n\n### PAC and politics of\n1940s[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: PAC and politics of 1940s\")]\n\nNew enemies appeared for the labor unions after 1935. Newspaper columnist\n[Westbrook Pegler](/wiki/Westbrook_Pegler \"Westbrook Pegler\") was especially\noutraged by the New Deal's support for powerful labor unions that he\nconsidered morally and politically corrupt. Pegler saw himself a populist and\nmuckraker whose mission was to warn the nation that dangerous leaders were in\npower. In 1941 Pegler became the first columnist ever to win a [Pulitzer\nPrize](/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize \"Pulitzer Prize\") for reporting, for his work in\nexposing [racketeering](/wiki/Racketeering \"Racketeering\") in Hollywood labor\nunions, focusing on the criminal career of [William Morris\nBioff](/wiki/William_Morris_Bioff \"William Morris Bioff\"). Pegler's popularity\nreflected a loss of support for unions and liberalism generally, especially as\nshown by the dramatic Republican gains in the 1946 elections, often using an\nanti-union theme.[93]\n\n#### Strike wave of\n1945[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Strike wave of 1945\")]\n\nWith the end of the war in August 1945 came a [wave of major\nstrikes](/wiki/Strike_wave_of_1946 \"Strike wave of 1946\"), mostly led by the\nCIO. In November, the UAW sent their 180,000 GM workers to the picket lines;\nthey were joined in January 1946 by a half-million steelworkers, as well as\nover 200,000 electrical workers and 150,000 packinghouse workers. Combined\nwith many smaller strikes a new record of strike activity was set.[94][95]\n\nThe results were mixed, with the unions making some gains, but the economy was\ndisordered by the rapid termination of war contracts, the complex reconversion\nto peacetime production, the return to the labor force of 12 million\nservicemen, and the return home of millions of women workers. The conservative\ncontrol of Congress blocked liberal legislation, and \"[Operation\nDixie](/wiki/Operation_Dixie \"Operation Dixie\")\", the CIO's efforts to expand\nmassively into the South, failed.[94]\n\nThe Republicans exploited public anger at the unions in 1946, winning a\nsmashing landslide. Labor responded afterwards by taking strong actions. The\nCIO systematically purged communists and far-left sympathizers from leadership\nroles in its unions.[96] The CIO expelled some unions that resisted the purge,\nnotably its third-largest affiliate the [United Electrical, Radio and Machine\nWorkers of\nAmerica](/wiki/United_Electrical,_Radio_and_Machine_Workers_of_America \"United\nElectrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America\") (UE), and set up a new\nrival union to take away the UE membership.[97]\n\nMeanwhile, the AFL in 1947 set up its first explicitly political unit, Labor's\nLeague for Political Education. The AFL increasingly abandoned its historic\ntradition of nonpartisanship, since neutrality between the major parties was\nimpossible. By 1952, the AFL had given up on decentralization, local autonomy,\nand non-partisanship, and had developed instead a new political approach\nmarked by the same style of centralization, national coordination, and\npartisan alliances that characterized the CIO.[98] After these moves, the CIO\nand AFL were in a good position to fight off Henry Wallace in 1948 and work\nenthusiastically for Truman's reelection. The CIO and AFL no longer had major\npoints of conflict, so they merged in amicably 1955 as the\n[AFL–CIO](/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93CIO \"AFL–CIO\").[99]\n\n### Taft-Hartley\nAct[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Taft-Hartley Act\")]\n\nFurther information: [Labor Management Relations Act of\n1947](/wiki/Labor_Management_Relations_Act_of_1947 \"Labor Management Relations\nAct of 1947\")\n\nThe [Labor Management Relations Act of\n1947](/wiki/Labor_Management_Relations_Act_of_1947 \"Labor Management Relations\nAct of 1947\"), also known as the _Taft–Hartley Act_ , in 1947 revised the\n[Wagner Act](/wiki/Wagner_Act \"Wagner Act\") to include restrictions on unions\nas well as management. It was a response to public demands for action after\nthe wartime coal strikes and the postwar strikes in steel, autos and other\nindustries that were perceived to have damaged the economy, as well as a\nthreatened 1946 railroad strike that was called off at the last minute before\nit shut down the national economy. The Act was bitterly fought by unions,\nvetoed by President [Harry S. Truman](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S.\nTruman\"), and passed over his veto. Repeated union efforts to repeal or modify\nit always failed, and it remains in effect today.\n\nThe Act was sponsored by Senator [Robert A. Taft](/wiki/Robert_A._Taft \"Robert\nA. Taft\") and Representative [Fred Hartley](/wiki/Fred_A._Hartley,_Jr. \"Fred\nA. Hartley, Jr.\"), both Republicans. Congress overrode the veto on June 23,\n1947, establishing the act as a law. Truman described the act as a \"slave-\nlabor bill\" in his veto, but after it was enacted over his veto, he used its\nemergency provisions a number of times to halt strikes and lockouts. The new\nlaw required all union officials to sign an affidavit that they were not\nCommunists or else the union would lose its federal bargaining powers\nguaranteed by the [National Labor Relations\nBoard](/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board \"National Labor Relations\nBoard\").[100]\n\nThe Taft-Hartley Act amended the Wagner Act, officially known as the [National\nLabor Relations Act](/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act \"National Labor\nRelations Act\"), of 1935. The amendments added to the NLRA a list of\nprohibited actions, or \"unfair labor practices\", on the part of unions. The\nNLRA had previously prohibited only unfair labor practices committed by\nemployers. It prohibited [jurisdictional strikes](/wiki/Jurisdictional_strikes\n\"Jurisdictional strikes\"), in which a union strikes in order to pressure an\nemployer to assign particular work to the employees that union represents, and\n[secondary boycotts](/wiki/Secondary_boycott \"Secondary boycott\") and \"common\nsitus\" [picketing](/wiki/Picketing_\\(protest\\) \"Picketing \\(protest\\)\"), in\nwhich unions picket, strike, or refuse to handle the goods of a business with\nwhich they have no primary dispute but which is associated with a targeted\nbusiness. A later statute, the [Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure\nAct](/wiki/Labor_Management_Reporting_and_Disclosure_Act \"Labor Management\nReporting and Disclosure Act\"), passed in 1959, tightened these restrictions\non secondary boycotts still further.\n\nThe Act outlawed [closed shops](/wiki/Closed_shop \"Closed shop\"), which were\ncontractual agreements that required an employer to hire only union members.\n[Union shops](/wiki/Union_shop \"Union shop\"), in which new recruits must join\nthe union within a certain amount of time, are permitted, but only as part of\na [collective bargaining agreement](/wiki/Collective_bargaining_agreement\n\"Collective bargaining agreement\") and only if the contract allows the worker\nat least thirty days after the date of hire or the effective date of the\ncontract to join the union. The [National Labor Relations\nBoard](/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board \"National Labor Relations Board\")\nand the courts have added other restrictions on the power of unions to enforce\n[union security](/wiki/Union_security \"Union security\") clauses and have\nrequired them to make extensive financial disclosures to all members as part\nof their [duty of fair representation](/wiki/Duty_of_fair_representation \"Duty\nof fair representation\"). On the other hand, a few years after the passage of\nthe Act Congress repealed the provisions requiring a vote by workers to\nauthorize a union shop, when it became apparent that workers were approving\nthem in virtually every case.\n\nThe amendments also authorized individual states to outlaw union security\nclauses entirely in their jurisdictions by passing [\"right-to-work\"\nlaws](/wiki/Right-to-work_law \"Right-to-work law\"). Currently all of the\nstates in the [Deep South](/wiki/Deep_South \"Deep South\") and a number of\ntraditionally Republican states in the\n[Midwest](/wiki/Midwestern_United_States \"Midwestern United States\"),\n[Plains](/wiki/Great_Plains \"Great Plains\") and [Rocky\nMountains](/wiki/Rocky_Mountains \"Rocky Mountains\") regions have right-to-work\nlaws.\n\nThe amendments required unions and employers to give sixty days' notice before\nthey may undertake strikes or other forms of economic action in pursuit of a\nnew collective bargaining agreement; it did not, on the other hand, impose any\n\"cooling-off period\" after a contract expired. Although the Act also\nauthorized the President to intervene in strikes or potential strikes that\ncreate a national emergency, the President has used that power less and less\nfrequently in each succeeding decade.\n\nHistorian [James T. Patterson](/wiki/James_T._Patterson_\\(historian\\) \"James\nT. Patterson \\(historian\\)\") concludes that:\n\n    \n\n    By the 1950s most observers agreed that Taft-Hartley was no more disastrous for workers than the Wagner Act had been for employers. What ordinarily mattered most in labor relations was not government laws such as Taft-Hartley, but the relative power of unions and management in the economic marketplace. Where unions were strong they usually managed all right; when they were weak, new laws did them little additional harm.[101]\n\n### Anti-\ncommunism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Anti-communism\")]\n\nThe AFL had always opposed Communists inside the labor movement. After 1945\nthey took their crusade worldwide. The CIO had major Communist elements who\nplayed a key role in organizational work in the late 1930s and war years. By\n1949 they were purged. The AFL and CIO strongly supported the Cold War\npolicies of the Truman administration, including the [Truman\nDoctrine](/wiki/Truman_Doctrine \"Truman Doctrine\"), the [Marshall\nPlan](/wiki/Marshall_Plan \"Marshall Plan\") and [NATO](/wiki/NATO \"NATO\").\nLeft-wing elements in the CIO protested and were forced out of the main\nunions. Thus [Walter Reuther](/wiki/Walter_Reuther \"Walter Reuther\") of the\n[United Automobile Workers](/wiki/United_Automobile_Workers \"United Automobile\nWorkers\") purged the UAW of all Communist elements. He was active in the CIO\numbrella as well, taking the lead in expelling eleven Communist-dominated\nunions from the CIO in 1949.[102]\n\nAs a leader of the anti-Communist center-left, Reuther was a founder of the\nliberal umbrella group [Americans for Democratic\nAction](/wiki/Americans_for_Democratic_Action \"Americans for Democratic\nAction\") in 1947. In 1949 he led the CIO delegation to the London conference\nthat set up the [International Confederation of Free Trade\nUnions](/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Free_Trade_Unions \"International\nConfederation of Free Trade Unions\") in opposition to the communist-dominated\n[World Federation of Trade Unions](/wiki/World_Federation_of_Trade_Unions\n\"World Federation of Trade Unions\"). He had left the Socialist Party in 1939,\nand throughout the 1950s and 1960s was a leading spokesman for liberal\ninterests in the CIO and in the Democratic Party.[103] [James B.\nCarey](/wiki/James_B._Carey \"James B. Carey\") also helped influence the CIO's\npullout from the WFTU and the formation of the ICFTU dedicated to promoting\nfree trade and democratic unionism worldwide. Carey in 1949 had formed the\nIUE, a new CIO union for electrical workers, because the old one, the UE, was\ntightly controlled by the left.[104][_[self-published\nsource](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\nMarxian economist [Richard D. Wolff](/wiki/Richard_D._Wolff \"Richard D.\nWolff\") argues that anti-communism was part of a strategy by big business,\nRepublicans and conservatives to single out and destroy the members of the\ncoalition that forced through the [New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\"),\nnamely organized labor, socialist and communist parties.[105]\n\n## Union decline\n1955–2016[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Union decline 1955–2016\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/U.S._Compensation_as_Percent_of_GDP_-\n_v1.png/400px-U.S._Compensation_as_Percent_of_GDP_-\n_v1.png)](/wiki/File:U.S._Compensation_as_Percent_of_GDP_-_v1.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:U.S._Compensation_as_Percent_of_GDP_-_v1.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nLabor's share of GDP has declined 1970 to 2016, measured based on total\ncompensation as well as salaries & wages. All employment is included, not just\nunion members.\n\nSince its peak in the mid-20th century, the American labor movement has been\nin steady decline, with losses in the private sector larger than gains in the\npublic sector. In the early 1950s, as the AFL and CIO merged, around a third\nof the American labor force was unionized; by 2012, the proportion was 11%,\nconstituting roughly 5% in the private sector and 40% in the public sector.\nOrganized labor's influence steadily waned and workers' collective voice in\nthe political process has weakened. Partly as a result, wages have stagnated\nand income inequality has increased.[106] \"Although the [National Labor\nRelations Act](/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act \"National Labor Relations\nAct\") was initially a boon for unions, it also sowed the seeds of the labor\nmovement's decline. The act enshrined the right to unionize, but the system of\nworkplace elections it created meant that unions had to organize each new\nfactory or firm individually rather than organize by industry. In many\nEuropean countries, collective-bargaining agreements extended automatically to\nother firms in the same industry, but in the United States, they usually\nreached no further than a plant's gates. As a result, in the first decades of\nthe postwar period, the organizing effort could not keep pace with the\nfrenetic rate of job growth in the economy as a whole\".[106] On the political\nfront, the shrinking unions lost influence in the Democratic Party, and pro-\nunion liberal Republicans faded away.[5] Intellectuals lost interest in\nunions, focusing their attention more on Vietnam, minorities, women and\nenvironmental issues.[107]\n\nBy the 1970s, a rapidly increasing flow of imports (such as automobiles, steel\nand electronics from Germany and Japan, and clothing and shoes from Asia)\nundercut American producers.[108] By the 1980s there was a large-scale shift\nin employment with fewer workers in high-wage sectors and more in the low-wage\nsectors.[109] Many companies closed or moved factories to Southern states\n(where unions were weak).[110] The effectiveness of strikes declined sharply,\nas companies after the 1970s threatened to close down factories or move them\nto low-wage states or to foreign countries.[111] The number of major work\nstoppages fell by 97% from 381 in 1970 to 187 in 1980 to only 11 in\n2010.[112][113] The accumulating weaknesses were exposed when President Ronald\nReagan—a former union president—broke the [Professional Air Traffic\nControllers Organization\n(PATCO)](/wiki/Professional_Air_Traffic_Controllers_Organization_\\(1968\\)\n\"Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization \\(1968\\)\") strike in 1981,\ndealing a major blow to unions.[114]\n\nUnion membership among workers in private industry shrank dramatically, though\nafter 1970 there was growth in employees unions of federal, state and local\ngovernments.[115][116] The intellectual mood in the 1970s and 1980s favored\nderegulation and free competition.[117] Numerous industries were deregulated,\nincluding airlines, trucking, railroads and telephones, over the objections of\nthe unions involved.[118]\n\nRepublicans, using conservative [think tanks](/wiki/Think_tank \"Think tank\")\nas idea farms, began to push through legislative blueprints to curb the power\nof public employee unions as well as eliminate business regulations.[111][119]\n\nUnion weakness in the [Southern United States](/wiki/Southern_United_States\n\"Southern United States\") undermined unionization and social reform throughout\nthe nation, and such weakness is largely responsible for the anaemic U.S.\n[welfare state](/wiki/Welfare_state \"Welfare state\").[120]\n\n### AFL and CIO merger\n1955[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: AFL and CIO merger 1955\")]\n\nThe friendly merger of the AFL and CIO marked an end not only to the acrimony\nand jurisdictional conflicts between the coalitions, it also signaled the end\nof the era of experimentation and expansion that began in the mid 1930s.\nMerger became politically possible because of the deaths of Green of the AFL\nand Murray of the CIO in late 1952, replaced by [George\nMeany](/wiki/George_Meany \"George Meany\") and Reuther. The CIO was no longer\nthe radical dynamo, and was no longer a threat in terms of membership for the\nAFL had twice as many members.[121]\n\nFurthermore, the AFL was doing a better job of expanding into the fast-growing\nwhite collar sector, with its organizations of clerks, public employees,\nteachers, and service workers. Although the AFL building trades maintained\nall-white policies, the AFL had more black members in all as the CIO. The\nproblem of union corruption was growing in public awareness, and CIO's\nindustrial unions were less vulnerable to penetration by criminal elements\nthan were the AFL's trucking, longshoring, building, and entertainment unions.\nBut Meany had a strong record in fighting corruption in New York unions, and\nwas highly critical of the notoriously corrupt Teamsters.[121]\n\nUnification would help the central organization fight corruption, yet would\nnot contaminate the CIO unions. The defeat of the New Deal in the 1952\nelection further emphasized the need for unity to maximize political\neffectiveness. From the CIO side the merger was promoted by [David\nMcDonald](/wiki/David_J._McDonald \"David J. McDonald\") of the Steelworkers and\nhis top aide [Arthur J. Goldberg](/wiki/Arthur_J._Goldberg \"Arthur J.\nGoldberg\"). To achieve the successful merger, they jettisoned the more liberal\npolicies of the CIO regarding civil rights and membership rights for blacks,\njurisdictional disputes, and industrial unionism. Reuther went along with the\ncompromises and did not contest the selection of Meany to head the AFL-\nCIO.[121]\n\nFearing the fallout of a drawn-out negotiation process, the AFL and CIO\nleadership decided on a \"short route\" to reconciliation. This meant all AFL\nand CIO unions would be accepted into the new organization \"as is,\" with all\nconflicts and overlaps to be sorted out after the merger.[122] Negotiations\nwere conducted by a small, select group of advisors. The draft constitution\nwas primarily written by AFL Vice President [Matthew Woll](/wiki/Matthew_Woll\n\"Matthew Woll\") and CIO General Counsel [Arthur\nGoldberg](/wiki/Arthur_Goldberg \"Arthur Goldberg\"), while the joint policy\nstatements were written by Woll, CIO Secretary-Treasurer James Carey, CIO vice\npresidents [David McDonald](/wiki/David_J._McDonald \"David J.

Both the business community and local Republicans\nwanted to weaken unions, which played a major role in funding and campaigning\nfor Democratic candidates.[124] The strategy of the Eisenhower administration\nwas to consolidate the anti-union potential inherent in Taft-Hartley.[125]\nPressure from the Justice Department, the Labor Department, and especially\nfrom congressional investigations focused on criminal activity and\nracketeering in high-profile labor unions, especially the [Teamsters\nUnion](/wiki/International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters \"International Brotherhood\nof Teamsters\"). Republicans wanted to delegitimize unions by focusing on their\nshady activities. The [McClellan Committee](/wiki/McClellan_Committee\n\"McClellan Committee\") hearings targeted Teamsters president [James R.\nHoffa](/wiki/James_R._Hoffa \"James R. Hoffa\") as a public enemy. Young Robert\nKennedy played a major role working for the committee.[126] Public opinion\npolls showed growing distrust toward unions, and especially union leaders—or\n\"labor bosses,\" as Republicans called them. The bipartisan [Conservative\nCoalition](/wiki/Conservative_Coalition \"Conservative Coalition\"), With the\naid of liberals such as the Kennedy brothers, won new Congressional\nrestrictions on organized labor in the form of the [Landrum-Griffin\nAct](/wiki/Landrum-Griffin_Act \"Landrum-Griffin Act\") (1959). The main impact\nwas to force more democracy on the previously authoritarian union\nhierarchies.[127][128] However, in [the 1958\nelections](/wiki/United_States_elections,_1958 \"United States elections,\n1958\"), taking place during a sharp economic recession, the unions fought back\nespecially against state [Right to Work laws](/wiki/Right-to-work_law \"Right-\nto-work law\") and defeated many conservative Republicans.[129][130]\n\nThe Teamsters union was expelled from the AFL for its notorious corruption\nunder president [Dave Beck](/wiki/Dave_Beck \"Dave Beck\").

They\ndemanded a reduction in the workweek to 32 from 40 hours, a $10,000 bonus, pay\nraises up to 40%, and early retirement.[138]\n\nFederal law forbade such a strike, and the Transportation department\nimplemented a backup plan (of supervisors and military air controllers) to\nkeep the system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work,\nelse they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal\ncapacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The\nstrike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a\nmajor reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board\nin the private sector.[138]\n\nSchulman and Zelizer argue that the breaking of PATCO, \"sent shock waves\nthrough the entire U.S. labor relations regime.... strike rates plummeted, and\nunion power sharply declined.\"[139] Unions suffered a continual decline of\npower during the Reagan administration, with a concomitant effect on wages.\nThe average first-year raise (for 1000-plus–worker contracts) fell from 9.8%\nto 1.2%; in manufacturing, raises fell from 7.2% to negative 1.2%.

However it\nremains responsible for pensions and medical benefits for 40,000 retired\nminers, and for 50,000 spouses and dependents.[143]\n\n##\n2016–present[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=39\n\"Edit section: 2016–present\")]\n\nThe number of union members nationwide increased from 2016 to 2017, and some\nstates saw union growth for the first time in several years or decades.[144]\nUnion growth in 2017 was primarily [millennial](/wiki/Millennials\n\"Millennials\") workers. For instance, about 76 percent of new UAW union\nmembers during their increase came from workers under the age of 35.[145]\nAlthough the total number of union members increased 1.7 percent in 2017, the\nEconomic Policy Institute noted that year-to-year union membership often\nfluctuates due to hiring or layoffs in particular sectors, and cautioned\nagainst interpreting one-year changes as trends.[146] The percentage of the\nworkforce belonging to unions was 10.7 percent in 2017, unchanged over the\nprevious year, but down from 11.1 percent in 2015, and 12.1 percent in\n2007.[147]\n\n### Teacher\nstrikes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=40\n\"Edit section: Teacher strikes\")]\n\nMain article: [2018 teachers' strikes in the United\nStates](/wiki/2018_teachers%27_strikes_in_the_United_States \"2018 teachers'\nstrikes in the United States\")\n\nIn 2018, a series of [statewide teacher strikes and\nprotests](/wiki/2018_teachers%27_strikes_in_the_United_States \"2018 teachers'\nstrikes in the United States\") happened garnering nationwide attention due to\ntheir success,[148] as well as the fact that several of them were in states\nwhere public-employee strikes are illegal. Many of the major strikes were in\n[Republican](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party\n\\(United States\\)\") majority state legislatures, leading to the name \"Red\nState Revolt\".[149] Protests were held in\n[Arizona](/wiki/2018_Arizona_teachers%27_strike \"2018 Arizona teachers'\nstrike\"), [Colorado](/wiki/2018_Colorado_teachers%27_strike \"2018 Colorado\nteachers' strike\"),[150] [North\nCarolina](/wiki/2018_North_Carolina_teachers%27_strike \"2018 North Carolina\nteachers' strike\"), [Oklahoma](/wiki/2018_Oklahoma_teachers%27_strike \"2018\nOklahoma teachers' strike\"),[151][152] and [West\nVirginia](/wiki/2018_West_Virginia_teachers%27_strike \"2018 West Virginia\nteachers' strike\").[153] Additional smaller protests were held in Kentucky and\nNorth Carolina. The protests spread to a [bus driver\nstrike](/wiki/2018_DeKalb_County_School_District_bus_drivers%27_strike \"2018\nDeKalb County School District bus drivers' strike\") in the suburbs of\n[Atlanta, Georgia](/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia \"Atlanta, Georgia\"), where nearly\n250 bus drivers participated.[154][155] The strikes included an [adjunct\nfaculty strike](/wiki/VCUarts_adjunct_workers%27_protests \"VCUarts adjunct\nworkers' protests\") at [Virginia Commonwealth\nUniversity](/wiki/Virginia_Commonwealth_University \"Virginia Commonwealth\nUniversity\")[156] in [Richmond, Virginia](/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia \"Richmond,\nVirginia\") leading to an increase in adjunct wages.[157]\n\n## Public-sector\nunions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=41\n\"Edit section: Public-sector unions\")]\n\nMain article: [Public-sector trade unions in the United States](/wiki/Public-\nsector_trade_unions_in_the_United_States \"Public-sector trade unions in the\nUnited States\")\n\nLabor unions generally ignored government employees because they were\ncontrolled mostly by the patronage system used by the political parties before\nthe arrival of civil service. Post Office workers did form unions. The\n[National Association of Letter\nCarriers](/wiki/National_Association_of_Letter_Carriers \"National Association\nof Letter Carriers\") started in 1889 and grew quickly. By the mid-1960s it had\n175,000 members in 6,400 local branches.[158]\n\nSeveral competing organizations of postal clerks emerged starting in the\n1890s. Merger discussions dragged on for years, until finally the NFPOC,\nUNMAPOC and others merged in 1961 as the United Federation of Postal Clerks.\nAnother round of mergers in 1971 produced the [American Postal Workers\nUnion](/wiki/American_Postal_Workers_Union \"American Postal Workers Union\")\n(APWU). In 2012 the APWU had 330,000 members.[159] The various postal unions\ndid not engage in strikes.\n\nMain article: [Boston Police Strike](/wiki/Boston_Police_Strike \"Boston Police\nStrike\")\n\nHistorian Joseph Slater, says, \"Unfortunately for public sector unions, the\nmost searing and enduring image of their history in the first half of the\ntwentieth century was the Boston police strike. The strike was routinely cited\nby courts and officials through the end of the 1940s.\"[160] Governor [Calvin\nCoolidge](/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge \"Calvin Coolidge\") broke the strike and the\nlegislature took control of the police away from city officials.[161]\n\nThe police strike chilled union interest in the public sector in the 1920s.\nThe major exception was the emergence of unions of public school teachers in\nthe largest cities; they formed the [American Federation of\nTeachers](/wiki/American_Federation_of_Teachers \"American Federation of\nTeachers\") (AFT), affiliated with the AFL. In suburbs and small cities, the\n[National Education Association](/wiki/National_Education_Association\n\"National Education Association\") (NEA) became active, but it insisted it was\nnot a labor union but a professional organization.[162]\n\n### New Deal\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=42\n\"Edit section: New Deal era\")]\n\nIn the mid 1930s efforts were made to unionize WPA workers, but were opposed\nby President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[163] Moe points out that Roosevelt, \"an\nardent supporter of collective bargaining in the private sector, was opposed\nto it in the public sector.\"[164] Roosevelt in 1937 told the nation what the\nposition of his government was: \"All Government employees should realize that\nthe process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be\ntransplanted into the public service.... The very nature and purposes of\ngovernment make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully\nor to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee\norganizations.[165]\n\n### \"Little New Deal\"\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=43\n\"Edit section: \"Little New Deal\" era\")]\n\nChange came in the 1950s. In 1958 New York mayor [Robert Wagner,\nJr.](/wiki/Robert_Wagner,_Jr. \"Robert Wagner, Jr.\") issued an executive order,\ncalled \"the little Wagner Act,\" giving city employees certain bargaining\nrights, and gave their unions with exclusive representation (that is, the\nunions alone were legally authorized to speak for all city workers, regardless\nof whether or not some workers were members.) Management complained but the\nunions had power in city politics.[166]\n\nBy the 1960s and 1970s public-sector unions expanded rapidly to cover\nteachers, clerks, firemen, police, prison guards and others. In 1962,\nPresident [John Kennedy](/wiki/John_Kennedy \"John Kennedy\") issued [Executive\nOrder 10988](/wiki/Executive_Order_10988 \"Executive Order 10988\"), upgrading\nthe status of unions of federal workers.[167]\n\n### Recent\nyears[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=44\n\"Edit section: Recent years\")]\n\nAfter 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high\npensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined,\nstate- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in\n1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.[168]\n\nIn 2009 the U.S. membership of public sector unions surpassed membership of\nprivate sector unions for the first time, at 7.9 million and 7.4 million\nrespectively.[169]\n\nIn 2011 states faced a growing fiscal crisis and the Republicans had made\nmajor gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy\nattack [especially in Wisconsin](/wiki/2011_Wisconsin_budget_protests \"2011\nWisconsin budget protests\"), as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from\nconservative Republican legislatures.[170][171][172] Conservative state\nlegislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to\ncollectively bargain. Conservatives argued that public unions were too\npowerful since they helped elect their bosses, and that overly generous\npension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.[173][174]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=45\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Syndicalism.svg/28px-Syndicalism.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Syndicalism.svg)[Organized labour portal](/wiki/Portal:Organized_labour \"Portal:Organized labour\")\n\n  * [United States labor law](/wiki/United_States_labor_law \"United States labor law\")\n  * [American Federation of Labor](/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor \"American Federation of Labor\") (AFL)\n  * [Gilded Age](/wiki/Gilded_Age \"Gilded Age\")\n  * [History of labor law in the United States](/wiki/History_of_labor_law_in_the_United_States \"History of labor law in the United States\")\n  * [International comparisons of labor unions](/wiki/International_comparisons_of_labor_unions \"International comparisons of labor unions\")\n  * [Labor federation competition in the United States](/wiki/Labor_federation_competition_in_the_United_States \"Labor federation competition in the United States\")\n  * [Labor unions in the United States](/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States \"Labor unions in the United States\")\n  * [List of strikes](/wiki/List_of_strikes \"List of strikes\") (many in the United States)\n  * [List of worker deaths in United States labor disputes](/wiki/List_of_worker_deaths_in_United_States_labor_disputes \"List of worker deaths in United States labor disputes\")\n  * [Minimum wage in the United States](/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States \"Minimum wage in the United States\")\n  * [New Deal coalition](/wiki/New_Deal_coalition \"New Deal coalition\")\n  * [History of unfree labor in the United States](/wiki/History_of_unfree_labor_in_the_United_States \"History of unfree labor in the United States\")\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Labor_history_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=46\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Robin Archer, _Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?_ (Princeton University Press, 2007)\n  2. **Jump up ^** [E.
