Grant narrowly lost his party's nomination, and chance for a third\nterm in 1880.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Wilson_at_Harding_Funeral.jpg/177px-\nWilson_at_Harding_Funeral.jpg)](/wiki/File:Wilson_at_Harding_Funeral.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Wilson_at_Harding_Funeral.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWoodrow Wilson, pictured in 1923, deadlocked the Democratic convention in\n1920, but was not nominated. He wished to run again in 1924, but lacked\nsupport and died before the convention.\n\nAlthough the Twenty-second Amendment was clearly a reaction to [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\")'s service as\nPresident for an unprecedented four terms, the notion of presidential term\nlimits has long-standing roots in American politics. The [Constitutional\nConvention of 1787](/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Constitutional Convention \\(United States\\)\") considered the issue\nextensively, although it ultimately declined to restrict the amount of time a\nperson could serve as president. But following [George\nWashington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\")'s decision to retire\nafter his second elected term, numerous public figures subsequently argued he\nhad established a \"two-term tradition\" that served as a vital check against\nany one person, or the presidency as a whole, accumulating too much power.[1]\n\nIn his [Farewell Address](/wiki/George_Washington%27s_Farewell_Address \"George\nWashington's Farewell Address\"), written near the end of his second term,\nWashington both reveals he considered not standing for reelection in\n1792,[Note 1] and that his decision not to seek a third term in 1796 was due\nto age, not intention to set precedent. Eleven years later, [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") further contributed to\nthe convention of a voluntary two-[term limit](/wiki/Term_limit \"Term limit\")\nwhen he wrote in 1807, \"if some termination to the services of the chief\nMagistrate be not fixed by the Constitution, or supplied by practice, his\noffice, nominally four years, will in fact become for life.\"[2] Three of the\nnext four presidents after Jefferson—[James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison\n\"James Madison\"), [James Monroe](/wiki/James_Monroe \"James Monroe\"), and\n[Andrew Jackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew Jackson\")—served two terms, and\neach one adhered to the two-term principle.\n\nIn spite of the strong two-term tradition, a few presidents prior to Franklin\nRoosevelt did attempt to secure a third term. [Ulysses S.\nGrant](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S. Grant\"), after having served as\n[president from 1869 to 1877](/wiki/Presidency_of_Ulysses_S._Grant \"Presidency\nof Ulysses S. Grant\"), sought nomination for another term at the [1880\nRepublican National Convention](/wiki/1880_Republican_National_Convention\n\"1880 Republican National Convention\"), but narrowly lost to [James\nGarfield](/wiki/James_Garfield \"James Garfield\"), who would go on to win the\n[1880 election](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1880 \"United States\npresidential election, 1880\"). Given the Republican Party's dominance during\nthat period, had Grant been nominated, he might well have won a third term.\n\n[Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore Roosevelt\") succeeded\nto the presidency on September 14, 1901, following [William McKinley's\nassassination](/wiki/Assassination_of_William_McKinley \"Assassination of\nWilliam McKinley\") (194 days into his second term), and was subsequently\nelected to a full term in\n[1904](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1904 \"United States\npresidential election, 1904\"). While he declined to seek a third (second full)\nterm in 1908, Roosevelt did seek one four years later, in the [election of\n1912](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1912 \"United States\npresidential election, 1912\"), where he lost to [Woodrow\nWilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson \"Woodrow Wilson\"). Wilson himself sought\nnomination to a third term in 1920, at the [Democratic National\nConvention](/wiki/1920_Democratic_National_Convention \"1920 Democratic\nNational Convention\");[3] he deliberately blocked the nomination of the former\n[Secretary of the Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury\n\"United States Secretary of the Treasury\"), his son-in-law [William Gibbs\nMcAdoo](/wiki/William_Gibbs_McAdoo \"William Gibbs McAdoo\"), the front-runner.\nAlthough seriously ill at the time, Wilson anticipated that the party would\nside with their sitting president were the convention deadlocked. Wilson was\ntoo unpopular even within his own party at the time, and [James M.\nCox](/wiki/James_M._Cox \"James M. Cox\") was nominated. He would again\ncontemplate running for a nonconsecutive third term in 1924, devising a\nstrategy for his comeback, but again lacked any support and died at the\nbeginning of the year.[4]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/1944_portrait_of_FDR_%281%29.jpg/260px-1944_portrait_of_FDR_%281%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:1944_portrait_of_FDR_\\(1\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1944_portrait_of_FDR_\\(1\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Franklin D. Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\"),\npictured in August 1944, was elected to both a third and fourth term, the only\npresident to serve more than eight years.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt spent the months leading up to the [1940 Democratic\nNational Convention](/wiki/1940_Democratic_National_Convention \"1940\nDemocratic National Convention\") refusing to state whether he would seek a\nthird term. His Vice President, [John Nance Garner](/wiki/John_Nance_Garner\n\"John Nance Garner\"), along with [Postmaster\nGeneral](/wiki/United_States_Postmaster_General \"United States Postmaster\nGeneral\") [James Farley](/wiki/James_Farley \"James Farley\"), announced their\ncandidacies for the Democratic nomination. When the convention came, Roosevelt\nsent a message to the convention, saying he would run only if\n[drafted](/wiki/Draft_\\(politics\\) \"Draft \\(politics\\)\"), saying delegates\nwere free to vote for whomever they pleased. The delegates issued 946 votes\nfor Roosevelt, 72 for Farley, and 61 for Garner; they replaced Garner with\n[Henry A. Wallace](/wiki/Henry_A._Wallace \"Henry A. Wallace\") as the vice\npresidential nominee, and Farley resigned as postmaster general. In the [1940\ngeneral election](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1940 \"United\nStates presidential election, 1940\"), while Republican [Wendell\nWillkie](/wiki/Wendell_Willkie \"Wendell Willkie\") received six million more\nvotes than the previous Republican candidate ([Alfred\nLandon](/wiki/Alfred_Landon \"Alfred Landon\")) had in 1936, Roosevelt still won\ndecisively, taking 38 of 48 states. His supporters cited impending war as a\nreason for breaking with precedent, while Willkie had run against the\nprinciple of a third term. Roosevelt was the first president elected to a\nthird term, and remains the only one to exceed eight years in office.\n\nFour years later, in the [election of\n1944](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1944 \"United States\npresidential election, 1944\"), Roosevelt defeated New York governor [Thomas E.\nDewey](/wiki/Thomas_E._Dewey \"Thomas E. Dewey\") to win an unprecedented fourth\nterm. While he effectively quelled rumors of his poor health during the\ncampaign, Roosevelt's health was in reality deteriorating. On April 12, 1945,\nonly 82 days after his [fourth\ninauguration](/wiki/Fourth_inauguration_of_Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Fourth\ninauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt\"), he suffered a [cerebral\nhemorrhage](/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage \"Cerebral hemorrhage\") and died.\n\nNear the end of the 1944 campaign, Thomas Dewey announced support of an\namendment that would limit future presidents to two terms. According to Dewey,\n\"four terms, or sixteen years (which is what Roosevelt would have served had\nhe lived until 1949), is the most dangerous threat to our freedom ever\nproposed.\"[5] The Republican-controlled [80th\nCongress](/wiki/80th_United_States_Congress \"80th United States Congress\")\napproved a [Joint resolution](/wiki/Joint_resolution \"Joint resolution\")\n\"proposing an amendment to the Constitution relating to the terms of office of\nthe president\". in March 1947;[6] it was signed by Speaker of the House\n[Joseph W. Martin](/wiki/Joseph_William_Martin,_Jr. \"Joseph William Martin,\nJr.\") and acting President pro tempore of the Senate [William F.\nKnowland](/wiki/William_F._Knowland \"William F. Knowland\").[7] The\nratification process for the 22nd Amendment was completed on February 27,\n1951, 7003143900000000000♠3 years, 343 days after it was sent to the states.\nThe new amendment's [2-term limit](/wiki/Term_limit \"Term limit\") did not\napply (due to the [grandfather clause](/wiki/Grandfather_clause \"Grandfather\nclause\") in Section 1) to the [incumbent](/wiki/Incumbent \"Incumbent\")\npresident, [Harry S. Truman](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S. Truman\"). He\nremained eligible for election to more than two terms.[6]\n\nOn November 22, 1963, President [John F. Kennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John\nF. Kennedy\") was assassinated while riding through [Dealey\nPlaza](/wiki/Dealey_Plaza \"Dealey Plaza\") in downtown [Dallas](/wiki/Dallas\n\"Dallas\"), [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\"). Vice President [Lyndon B.\nJohnson](/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson \"Lyndon B. Johnson\"), who was also in the\nmotorcade, three cars back, was unhurt. Upon Kennedy's death, Johnson\n[became](/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Lyndon_B._Johnson \"First inauguration of\nLyndon B. Johnson\") the nation's 36th president, and served out the remaining\n7002425000000000000♠1 year, 59 days of Kennedy's term. Under the terms of the\n22nd Amendment, Johnson, who ran for and won a full four–year term in\n[1964](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1964 \"United States\npresidential election, 1964\") was eligible to run for another full term in\n[1968](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1968 \"United States\npresidential election, 1968\") (as he had served less than two years of\nKennedy's term). He chose not to do so, announcing his intentions in a March\n31, 1968, speech to the nation, saying, \"I shall not seek, and I will not\naccept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"[8] Had\nhe done so and won, and served the full term (through January 20, 1973), the\ntotal length of his presidency would have been 7003334700000000000♠9 years, 59\ndays.\n\n## Proposal and ratification[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Twenty-\nsecond_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Proposal and ratification\")]\n\nCongress proposed the Twenty-second Amendment on March 21, 1947.[9] The\nproposed amendment was adopted on February 27, 1951.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/22nd_Amendment_Pg1of1_AC.jpg/220px-22nd_Amendment_Pg1of1_AC.jpg)](/wiki/File:22nd_Amendment_Pg1of1_AC.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:22nd_Amendment_Pg1of1_AC.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAmendment XXII in the [National\nArchives](/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration \"National\nArchives and Records Administration\")\n\nThe following states ratified the amendment:\n\n  1.

[Guy Vander\nJagt](/wiki/Guy_Vander_Jagt \"Guy Vander Jagt\"),[14] Rep. [David\nDreier](/wiki/David_Dreier \"David Dreier\")[15] and Sen. [Mitch\nMcConnell](/wiki/Mitch_McConnell \"Mitch McConnell\")[16] have introduced\nlegislation to repeal the Twenty-second Amendment, but each resolution died\nbefore making it out of its respective committee. Other alterations have been\nproposed, including replacing the absolute two term limit with a limit of no\nmore than two consecutive terms and giving Congress the power to grant an\nexemption to a current or former president by way of a\n[supermajority](/wiki/Supermajority \"Supermajority\") vote in both\nhouses.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nOn January 4, 2013, Rep. José E. Serrano again introduced a resolution\nproposing an Amendment to repeal the Twenty-second Amendment, as he had done\nevery two years since 1997; he did not do so during the [114th\nCongress](/wiki/114th_United_States_Congress \"114th United States\nCongress\").[17][18]\n\n## Interaction with the Twelfth Amendment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Twenty-\nsecond_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Interaction with the Twelfth Amendment\")]\n\nThere is a point of contention regarding the interpretation of the Twenty-\nsecond Amendment as it relates to the [Twelfth\nAmendment](/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twelfth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\"), ratified in 1804, which\nprovides that \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of\nPresident shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States\".\n\nWhile it is clear that under the Twelfth Amendment the original constitutional\nqualifications of age, citizenship, and residency apply to both the President\nand Vice President, it is unclear whether a two-term president could later\nserve as Vice President. Some argue that the Twenty-second Amendment and\nTwelfth Amendment bar any two-term president from later serving as Vice\nPresident as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the\n[United States presidential line of\nsuccession](/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession \"United States\npresidential line of succession\").[19] Others contend that the Twelfth\nAmendment concerns qualification for _service_ , while the Twenty-second\nAmendment concerns qualifications for _election_ , and thus a former two-term\npresident is still eligible to _serve_ as vice president.[20][21] The\npractical applicability of this distinction has not been tested, as no former\npresident has ever sought the vice presidency, although in 1980, former\npresident [Gerald Ford](/wiki/Gerald_Ford \"Gerald Ford\") was mentioned as a\npossible running mate for Republican presidential nominee [Ronald\nReagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan \"Ronald Reagan\") and there were some negotiations\nbetween the two camps. Nothing ever became of the idea,[22] and had Ford been\nselected, he would have still been eligible for election as President, as he\nhad only served less than one full term in finishing out [Richard\nNixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\")'s second term. During [Hillary\nClinton's 2016 candidacy](/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign,_2016\n\"Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016\"), she jokingly said that she had\nconsidered naming Bill Clinton as her Vice President, but had been advised it\nwould be unconstitutional.[23] Others contend that a \"termed out\" President\nwould be eligible to ascend to the Presidency via Presidential succession\nrules given the text's explicit reference to election.[24]\n\nThe Constitution does not restrict the number of terms a person can serve as\nVice President.[25]\n\n## Affected individuals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Twenty-\nsecond_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Affected individuals\")]\n\nThe amendment explicitly did not apply to the sitting president ([Harry S.\nTruman](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S. Truman\")) at the time it was proposed\nby Congress. Truman, who had served nearly all of Franklin D. Roosevelt's\nunexpired fourth term and who had been elected to a full term in\n[1948](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1948 \"United States\npresidential election, 1948\"), was thus eligible to seek re-election in 1952.\nHowever, after poor performance in the [1952 New Hampshire\nprimary](/wiki/New_Hampshire_primary#Winners_and_runners-up \"New Hampshire\nprimary\"), Truman chose not to seek his party's nomination. He theoretically\nalso would have been eligible in later elections.\n\nSince the amendment's ratification, [Dwight D.\nEisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\"), [Richard M.\nNixon](/wiki/Richard_M._Nixon \"Richard M. Nixon\"), [Ronald\nReagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan \"Ronald Reagan\"), [Bill\nClinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\"), [George W.\nBush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W. Bush\"), and [Barack\nObama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\") have been elected president twice.\nThe same party has won the presidency in three consecutive elections only once\nsince World War II, when Republican [George H. W.\nBush](/wiki/George_H._W._Bush \"George H. W. Bush\") won in\n[1988](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1988 \"United States\npresidential election, 1988\") after two terms as Vice President with\nRepublican [Ronald Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan \"Ronald Reagan\"). In all other\ncases, the opposing party's candidate has won after two terms with a single\nparty: [Dwight D. Eisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D.\nEisenhower\") (R) in 1952, [John F. Kennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John F.\nKennedy\") (D) in 1960, [Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\")\n(R) in 1968, [Jimmy Carter](/wiki/Jimmy_Carter \"Jimmy Carter\") (D) in 1976,\n[Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\") (D) in 1992, [George W.\nBush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W. Bush\") (R) in 2000, [Barack\nObama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\") (D) in 2008, and [Donald\nTrump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\") (R) in 2016. The only president who\ntook office after the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment and who\ncould have served more than eight years was [Lyndon B.\nJohnson](/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson \"Lyndon B. Johnson\").[26][27] He became\nPresident in 1963 when [John F. Kennedy was\nassassinated](/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy \"Assassination of John F.\nKennedy\"), served the final 14 months (less than two years) of Kennedy's term,\nwas elected president in\n[1964](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1964 \"United States\npresidential election, 1964\"), and ran briefly for re-election in 1968 but\nchose to withdraw from the race. [Gerald Ford](/wiki/Gerald_Ford \"Gerald\nFord\") became president on August 9, 1974, and served the final 29 months\n(more than two years) of [Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard\nNixon\")'s unexpired term. Ford, who lost to Jimmy Carter in\n[1976](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1976 \"United States\npresidential election, 1976\"), would have been eligible to be elected in his\nown right only once.\n\nSince Ford's death in 2006, the only former presidents who remain technically\neligible to seek another term are [Jimmy Carter](/wiki/Jimmy_Carter \"Jimmy\nCarter\") (elected in [1976](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1976\n\"United States presidential election, 1976\"), defeated in\n[1980](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1980 \"United States\npresidential election, 1980\")) and [George H. W. Bush](/wiki/George_H._W._Bush\n\"George H. W. Bush\") (elected in\n[1988](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1988 \"United States\npresidential election, 1988\"), defeated in\n[1992](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1992 \"United States\npresidential election, 1992\")); both are now nonagenarians and neither has\nannounced any plans to ever run again.\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Twenty-\nsecond_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** See [_George Washington 's Farewell Address_](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Washington%27s_Farewell_Address \"wikisource:Washington's Farewell Address\") _,_ **¶** 3\\.
