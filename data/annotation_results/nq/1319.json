There were an [estimated 2,224\npassengers and crew](/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic#Casualties_and_survivors\n\"Sinking of the RMS Titanic\") aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died,\nmaking it one of the deadliest commercial [peacetime maritime\ndisasters](/wiki/List_of_maritime_disasters#Peacetime_disasters \"List of\nmaritime disasters\") in modern history.

[Thomas\nAndrews](/wiki/Thomas_Andrews_\\(shipbuilder\\) \"Thomas Andrews\n\\(shipbuilder\\)\"), her architect, died in the disaster.[2]\n\n_Titanic_ was under the command of [Edward\nSmith](/wiki/Edward_Smith_\\(sea_captain\\) \"Edward Smith \\(sea captain\\)\"), who\nalso [went down with the ship](/wiki/The_captain_goes_down_with_the_ship \"The\ncaptain goes down with the ship\"). The ocean liner carried some of the\nwealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from [Great\nBritain and Ireland](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland \"United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\"), [Scandinavia](/wiki/Scandinavia\n\"Scandinavia\") and elsewhere throughout Europe who were seeking a new life in\nthe United States. The first-class accommodation was designed to be the\npinnacle of comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool,\nlibraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. A high-powered\n[radiotelegraph transmitter](/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy \"Wireless telegraphy\")\nwas available for sending passenger \"marconigrams\" and for the ship's\noperational use. Although _Titanic_ had advanced safety features such as\nwatertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, there were\nnot enough [lifeboats](/wiki/Lifeboat_\\(shipboard\\) \"Lifeboat \\(shipboard\\)\")\nto accommodate all of those aboard, due to outdated maritime safety\nregulations. _Titanic_ only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly\nmore than half of the number on board, and one third of her total capacity.\n\nAfter leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, _Titanic_ called at\n[Cherbourg](/wiki/Cherbourg \"Cherbourg\") in France and Queenstown (now\n[Cobh](/wiki/Cobh \"Cobh\")) in Ireland before heading west to New York.[3] On\n14 April, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of\n[Newfoundland](/wiki/Newfoundland_\\(island\\) \"Newfoundland \\(island\\)\"), she\nhit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time. The collision caused the ship's\n[hull](/wiki/Hull_\\(watercraft\\) \"Hull \\(watercraft\\)\") plates to buckle\ninwards along her [starboard](/wiki/Port_and_starboard \"Port and starboard\")\n(right) side and opened five of her sixteen watertight\n[compartments](/wiki/Compartment_\\(ship\\) \"Compartment \\(ship\\)\") to the sea;\nshe could only survive four flooding. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew\nmembers were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only\npartially loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of\na \"[women and children first](/wiki/Women_and_children_first \"Women and\nchildren first\")\" protocol for loading lifeboats.[4] At 2:20 a.m., she broke\napart and foundered—with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just\nunder two hours after the _Titanic_ sank, the Cunard liner [RMS\n_Carpathia_](/wiki/RMS_Carpathia \"RMS Carpathia\") arrived at the scene, where\nshe brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.\n\nThe disaster was met with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life\nand the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public\ninquiries in Britain and the United States led to [major improvements in\nmaritime\nsafety](/wiki/Changes_in_safety_practices_after_the_sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic\n\"Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the RMS Titanic\"). One of\ntheir most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the\n[International Convention for the Safety of Life at\nSea](/wiki/International_Convention_for_the_Safety_of_Life_at_Sea\n\"International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea\") (SOLAS), which still\ngoverns maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations\nwere passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in\nwireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.[5]\n\nThe [wreck of _Titanic_](/wiki/Wreck_of_the_RMS_Titanic \"Wreck of the RMS\nTitanic\") was first discovered in 1985 (more than 70 years after the\ndisaster), and the vessel remains on the seabed. The ship was split in two and\nis gradually disintegrating at a depth of 12,415 feet (3,784 m). Since her\ndiscovery in 1985, thousands of artefacts have been recovered and put on\ndisplay at museums around the world. _Titanic_ has become one of the most\nfamous ships in history; her memory is kept alive by numerous [works of\npopular culture, including books, folk songs, films, exhibits, and\nmemorials](/wiki/RMS_Titanic_in_popular_culture \"RMS Titanic in popular\nculture\"). Titanic is the second largest ocean liner wreck in the world, only\nbeaten by her sister [HMHS  _Britannic_](/wiki/HMHS_Britannic \"HMHS\nBritannic\"), the largest ever sunk.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Dimensions and layout\n  * 3 Features\n    * 3.1 Power\n    * 3.2 Technology\n      * 3.2.1 Watertight compartments and funnels\n      * 3.2.2 Rudder and steering engines\n      * 3.2.3 Water, ventilation and heating\n      * 3.2.4 Radio communications\n    * 3.3 Passenger facilities\n    * 3.4 Mail and cargo\n    * 3.5 Lifeboats\n  * 4 Building and preparing the ship\n    * 4.1 Construction, launch and fitting-out\n    * 4.2 Sea trials\n  * 5 Maiden voyage\n    * 5.1 Crew\n    * 5.2 Passengers\n    * 5.3 Collecting passengers\n    * 5.4 Atlantic crossing\n    * 5.5 Sinking\n  * 6 Aftermath of sinking\n    * 6.1 Arrival of _Carpathia_ in New York\n    * 6.2 Insurance and aid for survivors\n    * 6.3 Investigations into the disaster\n      * 6.3.1 Role of the SS _Californian_\n    * 6.4 Survivors and victims\n    * 6.5 Retrieval and burial of the dead\n  * 7 Wreck\n  * 8 Legacy\n    * 8.1 Safety\n    * 8.2 Cultural\n  * 9 Appendix\n  * 10 Titanic replicas\n  * 11 See also\n  * 12 Notes\n  * 13 References\n  * 14 Bibliography\n  * 15 External links\n\n## Background\n\nThe name _Titanic_ was derived [from Greek\nmythology](/wiki/Titan_\\(mythology\\) \"Titan \\(mythology\\)\") and meant\ngigantic. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in the [United Kingdom of Great Britain\nand Ireland](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland \"United Kingdom\nof Great Britain and Ireland\") (as it was then known), the\n[RMS](/wiki/Royal_Mail_Ship \"Royal Mail Ship\") _Titanic_ was the second of the\nthree [_Olympic_ -class ocean liners](/wiki/Olympic-class_ocean_liner\n\"Olympic-class ocean liner\")—the first was the [RMS\n_Olympic_](/wiki/RMS_Olympic \"RMS Olympic\") and the third was the [HMHS\n_Britannic_](/wiki/HMHS_Britannic \"HMHS Britannic\").[6] They were by far the\nlargest vessels of the British shipping company [White Star\nLine](/wiki/White_Star_Line \"White Star Line\")'s fleet, which comprised 29\nsteamers and tenders in 1912.[7] The three ships had their genesis in a\ndiscussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, [J. Bruce\nIsmay](/wiki/J._Bruce_Ismay \"J. Bruce Ismay\"), and the American financier [J.\nP. Morgan](/wiki/J._P._Morgan \"J. P. Morgan\"), who controlled the White Star\nLine's parent corporation, the [International Mercantile Marine\nCo.](/wiki/International_Mercantile_Marine_Co. \"International Mercantile\nMarine Co.\") (IMM).\n\nThe White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals\n[Cunard](/wiki/Cunard_Line \"Cunard Line\"), which had recently launched the\n[_Lusitania_](/wiki/RMS_Lusitania \"RMS Lusitania\") and the\n[_Mauretania_](/wiki/RMS_Mauretania_\\(1906\\) \"RMS Mauretania \\(1906\\)\")—the\nfastest passenger ships then in service—and the German lines [Hamburg\nAmerica](/wiki/Hamburg_America_Line \"Hamburg America Line\") and [Norddeutscher\nLloyd](/wiki/Norddeutscher_Lloyd \"Norddeutscher Lloyd\"). Ismay preferred to\ncompete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of\nliners that would be larger than anything that had gone before as well as\nbeing the last word in comfort and luxury.[8] The company sought an upgrade in\ntheir fleet primarily in response to the Cunard giants but also to replace\ntheir oldest pair of passenger ships still in service, being the [SS\n_Teutonic_](/wiki/SS_Teutonic \"SS Teutonic\") of 1889 and [SS\n_Majestic_](/wiki/SS_Majestic_\\(1890\\) \"SS Majestic \\(1890\\)\") of 1890.\n_Teutonic_ was replaced by _Olympic_ while _Majestic_ was replaced by\n_Titanic_. _Majestic_ would be brought back into her old spot on White Star's\nNew York service after _Titanic '_s loss.[9]\n\nThe ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilders [Harland and\nWolff](/wiki/Harland_and_Wolff \"Harland and Wolff\"), who had a long-\nestablished relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.[10]\nHarland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for\nthe White Star Line; the usual approach was for the latter to sketch out a\ngeneral concept which the former would take away and turn into a ship design.\nCost considerations were relatively low on the agenda and Harland and Wolff\nwas authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five percent\nprofit margin.[10] In the case of the _Olympic_ -class ships, a cost of £3\nmillion (£250 million in 2015 money) for the first two ships was agreed plus\n\"extras to contract\" and the usual five percent fee.[11]\n\nHarland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing the _Olympic_\n-class vessels. The design was overseen by [Lord\nPirrie](/wiki/William_Pirrie,_1st_Viscount_Pirrie \"William Pirrie, 1st\nViscount Pirrie\"), a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star\nLine; [naval architect](/wiki/Naval_architecture \"Naval architecture\") [Thomas\nAndrews](/wiki/Thomas_Andrews_\\(shipbuilder\\) \"Thomas Andrews\n\\(shipbuilder\\)\"), the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design\ndepartment; Edward Wilding, Andrews' deputy and responsible for calculating\nthe ship's design, stability and trim; and [Alexander\nCarlisle](/wiki/Alexander_Carlisle \"Alexander Carlisle\"), the shipyard's chief\ndraughtsman and general manager.[12] Carlisle's responsibilities included the\ndecorations, equipment and all general arrangements, including the\nimplementation of an efficient [lifeboat](/wiki/Lifeboat_\\(shipboard\\)\n\"Lifeboat \\(shipboard\\)\") [davit](/wiki/Davit \"Davit\") design.[a]\n\nOn 29 July 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay\nand other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed\nthree \"letters of agreement\" two days later, authorising the start of\nconstruction.[15] At this point the first ship—which was later to become\n_Olympic_ —had no name, but was referred to simply as \"Number 400\", as it was\nHarland and Wolff's four hundredth hull. _Titanic_ was based on a revised\nversion of the same design and was given the number 401.[16]\n\n## Dimensions and layout\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Cd51-1000g.gif/400px-\nCd51-1000g.gif)](/wiki/File:Cd51-1000g.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cd51-1000g.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Titanic_ in 1912\n\n_Titanic_ was 882 feet 9 inches (269.06 m) long with a maximum breadth of 92\nfeet 6 inches (28.19 m). Her total height, measured from the base of the keel\nto the top of the bridge, was 104 feet (32 m).[17] She measured 46,328 [gross\nregister tons](/wiki/Gross_register_tonnage \"Gross register tonnage\") and with\na draught of 34 feet 7 inches (10.54 m), she displaced 52,310 tons.[18]\n\nAll three of the _Olympic_ -class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of\nthe officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to\nbottom, the decks were:\n\n  * **The Boat Deck** , on which the lifeboats were housed. It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912 that _Titanic_ 's lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood 8 feet (2.4 m) above the deck, extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood directly behind and above the bridge. The entrance to the First Class [Grand Staircase](/wiki/Grand_Staircase_of_the_RMS_Titanic \"Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic\") and gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled.[19][20]\n  * **A Deck** , also called the **Promenade Deck** , extended along the entire 546 feet (166 m) length of the superstructure. It was reserved exclusively for First Class passengers and contained First Class cabins, the First Class lounge, smoke room, reading and writing rooms and Palm Court.[19]\n  * **B Deck** , the **Bridge Deck** , was the top weight-bearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull. More First Class passenger accommodations were located here with six palatial staterooms (cabins) featuring their own private promenades. On _Titanic_ , the _À La Carte_ Restaurant and the Café Parisien provided luxury dining facilities to First Class passengers. Both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff; all were lost in the disaster. The Second Class smoking room and entrance hall were both located on this deck. The raised forecastle of the ship was forward of the Bridge Deck, accommodating Number 1 hatch (the main hatch through to the cargo holds), numerous pieces of machinery and the anchor housings.[b] Aft of the Bridge Deck was the raised Poop Deck, 106 feet (32 m) long, used as a promenade by Third Class passengers. It was where many of _Titanic_ 's passengers and crew made their last stand as the ship sank. The forecastle and Poop Deck were separated from the Bridge Deck by [well decks](/wiki/Well_deck \"Well deck\").[21][22]\n  * **C Deck** , the **Shelter Deck** , was the highest deck to run uninterrupted from stem to stern. It included both well decks; the aft one served as part of the Third Class promenade. Crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and Third Class public rooms were housed below the Poop Deck. In between were the majority of First Class cabins and the Second Class library.[21][23]\n  * **D Deck** , the **Saloon Deck** , was dominated by three large public rooms—the First Class Reception Room, the First Class Dining Saloon and the Second Class Dining Saloon. An open space was provided for Third Class passengers. First, Second and Third Class passengers had cabins on this deck, with berths for firemen located in the bow. It was the highest level reached by the ship's watertight bulkheads (though only by eight of the fifteen bulkheads).[21][24]\n  * **E Deck** , the **Upper Deck** , was predominantly used for passenger accommodation for all three classes plus berths for cooks, seamen, stewards and [trimmers](/wiki/Coal_trimmer \"Coal trimmer\"). Along its length ran a long passageway nicknamed [Scotland Road](/wiki/Scotland_Road \"Scotland Road\"), in reference to a famous street in Liverpool. Scotland Road was used by Third Class passengers and crew members.[21][25]\n  * **F Deck** , the **Middle Deck** , was the last complete deck and mainly accommodated Second and Third Class passengers and several departments of the crew. The Third Class dining saloon was located here, as were the swimming pool and Turkish bath.[21][25]\n  * **G Deck** , the **Lower Deck** , was the lowest complete deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. The squash court was located here along with the traveling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by [orlop](/wiki/Orlop \"Orlop\") (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.[21][26]\n  * The **Orlop Decks** and the **Tank Top** below that were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the Tank Top—the inner bottom of the ship's hull—provided the platform on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing. They were connected with higher levels of the ship by flights of stairs; twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to D Deck.[21][26]\n\n## Features\n\n### Power\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Titanic_stern_and_rudder.jpg/180px-\nTitanic_stern_and_rudder.jpg)](/wiki/File:Titanic_stern_and_rudder.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Titanic_stern_and_rudder.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRudder with central and port wing propellers[c] for scale note the man at\nbottom of the photo\n\n_Titanic_ was equipped with three main engines—two\n[reciprocating](/wiki/Reciprocating_engine \"Reciprocating engine\")\nfour-[cylinder](/wiki/Cylinder_\\(engine\\) \"Cylinder \\(engine\\)\"), [triple-\nexpansion](/wiki/Triple-expansion \"Triple-expansion\") [steam\nengines](/wiki/Steam_engine \"Steam engine\") and one centrally placed low-\npressure [Parsons turbine](/wiki/Steam_turbine \"Steam turbine\")—each driving a\n[propeller](/wiki/Propeller_\\(marine\\) \"Propeller \\(marine\\)\"). The two\nreciprocating engines had a combined output of 30,000 hp and a further 16,000\nhp was contributed by the turbine.[17] The White Star Line had used the same\ncombination of engines on an earlier liner, the [SS\n_Laurentic_](/wiki/SS_Laurentic_\\(1908\\) \"SS Laurentic \\(1908\\)\"), where it\nhad been a great success.[28] It provided a good combination of performance\nand speed; reciprocating engines by themselves were not powerful enough to\npropel an _Olympic_ -class liner at the desired speeds, while turbines were\nsufficiently powerful but caused uncomfortable vibrations, a problem that\naffected the all-turbine Cunard liners [_Lusitania_](/wiki/RMS_Lusitania \"RMS\nLusitania\") and [_Mauretania_](/wiki/RMS_Mauretania_\\(1906\\) \"RMS Mauretania\n\\(1906\\)\").[29] By combining reciprocating engines with a turbine, fuel usage\ncould be reduced and motive power increased, while using the same amount of\nsteam.[30]\n\nThe two reciprocating engines were each 63 feet (19 m) long and weighed 720\ntons, with their bedplates contributing a further 195 tons.[29] They were\npowered by steam produced in 29 boilers, 24 of which were double-ended and\nfive single-ended, which contained a total of 159 furnaces.[31] The boilers\nwere 15 feet 9 inches (4.80 m) in diameter and 20 feet (6.1 m) long, each\nweighing 91.5 tons and capable of holding 48.5 tons of water.[32]\n\nThey were heated by burning coal, 6,611 tons of which could be carried in\n_Titanic_ 's bunkers, with a further 1,092 tons in Hold 3. The furnaces\nrequired over 600 tons of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand,\nrequiring the services of 176 [firemen](/wiki/Fireman_\\(steam_engine\\)\n\"Fireman \\(steam engine\\)\") working around the clock.[33] 100 tons of ash a\nday had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea.[34] The work was\nrelentless, dirty and dangerous, and although firemen were paid relatively\ngenerously[33] there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that\ncapacity.[35]\n\nExhaust steam leaving the reciprocating engines was fed into the turbine,\nwhich was situated aft. From there it passed into a [surface\ncondenser](/wiki/Surface_condenser \"Surface condenser\"), to increase the\nefficiency of the turbine and so that the steam could be condensed back into\nwater and reused.[36] The engines were attached directly to long shafts which\ndrove the propellers. There were three, one for each engine; the outer (or\nwing) propellers were the largest, each carrying three blades of manganese-\nbronze alloy with a total diameter of 23.5 feet (7.2 m).[32] The middle\npropeller was slightly smaller at 17 feet (5.2 m) in diameter,[37] and could\nbe stopped but not reversed.\n\n_Titanic_ 's electrical plant was capable of producing more power than an\naverage city power station of the time.[38] Immediately aft of the turbine\nengine were four 400 kW steam-driven electric generators, used to provide\nelectrical power to the ship, plus two 30 kW auxiliary generators for\nemergency use.[39] Their location in the stern of the ship meant they remained\noperational until the last few minutes before the ship sank.[40]\n\n### Technology\n\n#### Watertight compartments and funnels\n\nThe interiors of the _Olympic_ -class ships were subdivided into 16 primary\n[compartments](/wiki/Compartment_\\(ship\\) \"Compartment \\(ship\\)\") divided by\n15 bulkheads which extended well above the waterline. Eleven vertically\nclosing watertight doors could seal off the compartments in the event of an\nemergency.[41] The ship's exposed decking was made of pine and teak, while\ninterior ceilings were covered in painted granulated\n[cork](/wiki/Cork_\\(material\\) \"Cork \\(material\\)\") to combat\ncondensation.[42] Standing above the decks were four funnels, each painted\nbuff with black tops, (though only three were functional—the last one was a\ndummy, installed for aesthetic purposes and also for kitchen ventilation)—and\ntwo masts, each 155 feet (47 m) high, which supported derricks for working\ncargo.\n\n#### Rudder and steering engines\n\n_Titanic_ 's rudder was so large—at 78 feet 8 inches (23.98 m) high and 15\nfeet 3 inches (4.65 m) long, weighing over 100 tons—that it required [steering\nengines](/wiki/Steering_engine \"Steering engine\") to move it. Two steam-\npowered steering engines were installed though only one was used at any one\ntime, with the other one kept in reserve. They were connected to the short\n[tiller](/wiki/Tiller \"Tiller\") through stiff springs, to isolate the steering\nengines from any shocks in heavy seas or during fast changes of direction.[43]\nAs a last resort, the tiller could be moved by ropes connected to two steam\n[capstans](/wiki/Capstan_\\(nautical\\) \"Capstan \\(nautical\\)\").[44] The\ncapstans were also used to raise and lower the ship's five anchors (one port,\none starboard, one in the centreline and two [kedging\nanchors](/wiki/Anchor#Kedging \"Anchor\")).[44]\n\n#### Water, ventilation and heating\n\nThe ship was equipped with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping\nwater to all parts of the vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves.\nThe main water supply was taken aboard while _Titanic_ was in port, but in an\nemergency the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this\nwas not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became\nclogged by salt deposits. A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air,\ndriven by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class cabins were fitted\nwith additional electric heaters.[38]\n\n#### Radio communications\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/1913_Marconi_operator_room_for_5_kilowatt_ocean_liner_station.JPG/250px-1913_Marconi_operator_room_for_5_kilowatt_ocean_liner_station.JPG)](/wiki/File:1913_Marconi_operator_room_for_5_kilowatt_ocean_liner_station.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1913_Marconi_operator_room_for_5_kilowatt_ocean_liner_station.JPG\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nMarconi company receiving equipment for a 5 kilowatt ocean liner station.\n\n_Titanic '_s radiotelegraph equipment (then known as [wireless\ntelegraphy](/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy \"Wireless telegraphy\")) was leased to\nthe White Star Line by the [Marconi International Marine Communication\nCompany](/wiki/Marconi_Company \"Marconi Company\"), which also supplied two of\nits employees, [Jack Phillips](/wiki/Jack_Phillips_\\(wireless_officer\\) \"Jack\nPhillips \\(wireless officer\\)\") and [Harold Bride](/wiki/Harold_Bride \"Harold\nBride\"), as operators. The service maintained a 24-hour schedule, primarily\nsending and receiving passenger telegrams, but also handling navigation\nmessages including weather reports and ice warnings.[45][46]\n\nThe radio room was located on the Boat Deck, in the officers' quarters. A\nsoundproofed \"Silent Room\", next to the operating room, housed loud equipment,\nincluding the transmitter and a motor-generator used for producing alternating\ncurrents. The operators' living quarters were adjacent to the working office.\nThe ship was equipped with a 'state of the art' 5 kilowatt rotary [spark-gap\ntransmitter](/wiki/Spark-gap_transmitter \"Spark-gap transmitter\"), operating\nunder the radio callsign MGY, and communication was conducted in [Morse\ncode](/wiki/Morse_code \"Morse code\"). This transmitter was one of the first\nMarconi installations to use a rotary spark gap, which gave _Titanic_ a\ndistinctive musical tone that could be readily distinguished from other\nsignals. The transmitter was one of the most powerful in the world, and\nguaranteed to broadcast over a radius of 350 miles (563 km). An elevated\n[T-antenna](/wiki/T-antenna \"T-antenna\") that spanned the length of the ship\nwas used for transmitting and receiving. The normal operating frequency was\n500 kHz (600 m wavelength), however the equipment could also operate on the\n\"short\" wavelength of 1000 kHz (300 m wavelength) that was employed by smaller\nvessels with shorter antennas.[47]\n\n### Passenger facilities\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

According to _Titanic '_s general arrangement plans, the ship could\naccommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second Class and 1,006 in Third\nClass, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for\ncrew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration\nhave stated that her full carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was\napproximately 3,547. Her interior design was a departure from that of other\npassenger liners, which had typically been decorated in the rather heavy style\nof a [manor house](/wiki/Manor_house \"Manor house\") or an [English country\nhouse](/wiki/English_country_house \"English country house\").[48]\n\n_Titanic_ was laid out in a much lighter style similar to that of contemporary\nhigh-class hotels—the [Ritz Hotel](/wiki/The_Ritz_London_Hotel \"The Ritz\nLondon Hotel\") was a reference point—with First Class cabins finished in the\n[Empire style](/wiki/Empire_style \"Empire style\").[48] A variety of other\ndecorative styles, ranging from the [Renaissance](/wiki/Renaissance\n\"Renaissance\") to [Louis XV](/wiki/Louis_XV_Style \"Louis XV Style\"), were used\nto decorate cabins and public rooms in First and Second Class areas of the\nship. The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a\nfloating hotel rather than a ship; as one passenger recalled, on entering the\nship's interior a passenger would \"at once lose the feeling that we are on\nboard ship, and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on\nshore\".[49]\n\nAmong the more novel features available to first-class passengers was a 7 ft.\ndeep saltwater swimming pool, a gymnasium, a [squash](/wiki/Squash_\\(sport\\)\n\"Squash \\(sport\\)\") court, and a [Turkish bath](/wiki/Turkish_bath \"Turkish\nbath\") which comprised [electric bath](/wiki/Electric_bath \"Electric bath\"),\nsteam room, cool room, massage room, and hot room.[49] First-class common\nrooms were impressive in scope and lavishly decorated. They included a Lounge\nin the style of the [Palace of Versailles](/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles \"Palace\nof Versailles\"), an enormous Reception Room, a men's Smoking Room, and a\nReading and Writing Room. There was an À la Carte Restaurant in the style of\nthe [Ritz Hotel](/wiki/The_Ritz_Hotel,_London \"The Ritz Hotel, London\") which\nwas run as a concession by the famous Italian restaurateur Gaspare Gatti.[50]\nA _Café Parisien_ decorated in the style of a French sidewalk café, complete\nwith ivy covered trellises and wicker furniture, was run as an annex to the\nrestaurant. For an extra cost, first-class passengers could enjoy the finest\nFrench _haute cuisine_ in the most luxurious of surroundings.[51] There was\nalso a _Verandah Café_ where tea and light refreshments were served, that\noffered grand views of the ocean. At 114 ft. long X 92 ft. wide, the Dining\nSaloon on D-Deck was the largest room afloat and could seat almost 600\npassengers at a time.[52] Third Class (commonly referred to as Steerage)\naccommodations aboard _Titanic_ were not as luxurious as First or Second\nClass, but even so were better than on many other ships of the time. They\nreflected the improved standards which the White Star Line had adopted for\ntrans-Atlantic immigrant and lower-class travel. On most other North Atlantic\npassenger ships at the time, Third Class accommodations consisted of little\nmore than open dormitories in the forward end of the vessels, in which\nhundreds of people were confined, often without adequate food or toilet\nfacilities.\n\nThe White Star Line had long since broken that mould. As seen aboard _Titanic_\n, all White Star Line passenger ships divided their Third Class accommodations\ninto two sections, always at opposite ends of the vessel from one another. The\nestablished arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward\nareas, while single women, married couples and families were quartered aft. In\naddition, while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements,\nWhite Star Line vessels provided their Third Class passengers with private,\nsmall but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two, four, six, eight\nand 10 passengers.[53]\n\nThird Class accommodations also included their own dining rooms, as well as\npublic gathering areas including adequate open deck space, which aboard\n_Titanic_ comprised the Poop Deck at the stern, the forward and aft well\ndecks, and a large open space on D Deck which could be used as a social hall.\nThis was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a General\nRoom on C Deck which women could use for reading and writing. Although they\nwere not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper class accommodations,\nthey were still far above average for the period.\n\nLeisure facilities were provided for all three classes to pass the time. As\nwell as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms,\nand gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open\ndeck, promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A\npassenger list was published before the sailing to inform the public which\nmembers of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for\nambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they\ncould introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.[54]\n\nOne of _Titanic_ 's most distinctive features was her First Class staircase,\nknown as the [Grand Staircase](/wiki/Grand_Staircase_of_the_RMS_Titanic \"Grand\nStaircase of the RMS Titanic\") or Grand Stairway. Built of solid [English\noak](/wiki/English_oak \"English oak\") with a sweeping curve, the staircase\ndescended through seven decks of the ship, between the Boat Deck to E deck,\nbefore terminating in a simplified single flight on F Deck.[55] It was capped\nwith a dome of wrought iron and glass that admitted natural light to the\nstairwell. Each landing off the staircase gave access to ornate entrance halls\npaneled in the [William & Mary](/wiki/William_and_Mary_style \"William and Mary\nstyle\") style and lit by [ormolu](/wiki/Ormolu \"Ormolu\") and crystal light\nfixtures.[56]\n\nAt the uppermost landing was a large carved wooden panel containing a clock,\nwith figures of \"Honour and Glory Crowning Time\" flanking the clock face.[55]\nThe Grand Staircase was destroyed during the sinking and is now just a void in\nthe ship which modern explorers have used to access the lower decks.[57]\nDuring the filming of James Cameron's _[Titanic](/wiki/Titanic_\\(1997_film\\)\n\"Titanic \\(1997 film\\)\")_ in 1997, his replica of the Grand Staircase was\nripped from its foundations by the force of the inrushing water on the set. It\nhas been suggested that during the real event, the entire Grand Staircase was\nejected upwards through the dome.[58]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Titanic_gymnasium.jpg/274px-\nTitanic_gymnasium.jpg)](/wiki/File:Titanic_gymnasium.jpg)\n\nThe gymnasium on the Boat Deck, which was equipped with the latest exercise\nmachines\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Drawing_of_the_Grand_Staircase_onboard_the_RMS_Titanic_from_the_1912_promotional_booklet.jpg/282px-\nDrawing_of_the_Grand_Staircase_onboard_the_RMS_Titanic_from_the_1912_promotional_booklet.jpg)](/wiki/File:Drawing_of_the_Grand_Staircase_onboard_the_RMS_Titanic_from_the_1912_promotional_booklet.jpg)\n\nThe famous Grand Staircase, which connected Boat Deck and E Deck\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Swimming_pool_of_the_Titanic.jpg/270px-\nSwimming_pool_of_the_Titanic.jpg)](/wiki/File:Swimming_pool_of_the_Titanic.jpg)\n\nSwimming Pool on the Titanic\n\n### Mail and cargo\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/La_Circassienne_au_Bain%2C_After_Blondel.JPG/170px-\nLa_Circassienne_au_Bain%2C_After_Blondel.JPG)](/wiki/File:La_Circassienne_au_Bain,_After_Blondel.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:La_Circassienne_au_Bain,_After_Blondel.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[La Circassienne au Bain](/wiki/La_Circassienne_au_Bain \"La Circassienne au\nBain\")_ ; the most highly valued item of cargo lost on the Titanic.[d]\n\nAlthough _Titanic_ was primarily a passenger liner, she also carried a\nsubstantial amount of cargo. Her designation as a [Royal Mail\nShip](/wiki/Royal_Mail_Ship \"Royal Mail Ship\") (RMS) indicated that she\ncarried mail under contract with the [Royal Mail](/wiki/Royal_Mail \"Royal\nMail\") (and also for the [United States Post Office\nDepartment](/wiki/United_States_Post_Office_Department \"United States Post\nOffice Department\")). For the storage of letters, parcels and specie (bullion,\ncoins and other valuables), 26,800 cubic feet (760 m3) of space in her holds\nwas allocated. The Sea Post Office on G Deck was manned by five postal clerks;\nthree Americans and two Britons, who worked 13 hours a day, seven days a week\nsorting up to 60,000 items daily.[60]\n\nThe ship's passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage; another\n19,455 cubic feet (550.9 m3) was taken up by first- and second-class baggage.\nIn addition, there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo, ranging from\nfurniture to foodstuffs and even motor cars.[60] Despite later myths, the\ncargo on _Titanic_ 's maiden voyage was fairly mundane; there was no gold,\n[exotic minerals](/wiki/Raise_the_Titanic! \"Raise the Titanic!\") or diamonds,\nand one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck, a jewelled copy of the\n_[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam](/wiki/Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam \"Rubaiyat of Omar\nKhayyam\")_ , was valued at only £405 (£36,200 today).[61] According to the\nclaims for compensation filed with Commissioner Gilchrist, following the\nconclusion of the Senate Inquiry, the single most highly valued item of\nluggage or cargo was a large neoclassical oil painting entitled _[La\nCircassienne au Bain](/wiki/La_Circassienne_au_Bain \"La Circassienne au\nBain\")_ by French artist [Merry-Joseph Blondel](/wiki/Merry-Joseph_Blondel\n\"Merry-Joseph Blondel\"). The painting's owner, first class passenger [Mauritz\nHåkan Björnström-\nSteffansson](/wiki/Mauritz_H%C3%A5kan_Bj%C3%B6rnstr%C3%B6m-Steffansson\n\"Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson\"), filed a claim for $100,000 ($2.4\nmillion equivalent in 2014) in compensation for the loss of the artwork.[59]\n\n_Titanic_ was equipped with eight electric cranes, four electric winches and\nthree steam winches to lift cargo and baggage in and out of the hold. It is\nestimated that the ship used some 415 tons of coal whilst in Southampton,\nsimply generating steam to operate the cargo winches and provide heat and\nlight.[62]\n\n### Lifeboats\n\nMain article: [Lifeboats of the RMS\nTitanic](/wiki/Lifeboats_of_the_RMS_Titanic \"Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Titanic_lifeboat.jpg/250px-\nTitanic_lifeboat.jpg)](/wiki/File:Titanic_lifeboat.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Titanic_lifeboat.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA collapsible lifeboat with canvas sides\n\n_Titanic_ carried a total of 20 lifeboats: 14 standard wooden Harland and\nWolff lifeboats with a capacity of 65 people each and four Englehardt\n\"collapsible\" (wooden bottom, collapsible canvas sides) lifeboats (identified\nas A to D) with a capacity of 47 people each. In addition, she had two\nemergency [cutters](/wiki/Cutter_\\(boat\\)#Rowing \"Cutter \\(boat\\)\") with a\ncapacity of 40 people each.[63][e] _Olympic_ herself did not even carry the\nfour collapsibles A–D during the 1911–12 season. All of the lifeboats were\nstowed securely on the boat deck and, except for collapsible lifeboats A and\nB, connected to [davits](/wiki/Davit \"Davit\") by ropes. Those on the starboard\nside were odd-numbered 1–15 from bow to stern, while those on the port side\nwere even-numbered 2–16 from bow to stern.[64]\n\nBoth cutters were kept swung out, hanging from the davits, ready for immediate\nuse, while collapsible lifeboats C and D were stowed on the boat deck\n(connected to davits) immediately inboard of boats 1 and 2 respectively. A and\nB were stored on the roof of the officers' quarters, on either side of number\n1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them\ndifficult to launch by hand.[64] Each boat carried (among other things) food,\nwater, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides\nenabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.\n\n_Titanic_ had 16 sets of davits, each able to handle four lifeboats. This gave\n_Titanic_ the ability to carry up to 64 wooden lifeboats[65] which would have\nbeen enough for 4,000 people—considerably more than her actual capacity.\nHowever, the White Star Line decided that only 16 wooden lifeboats and four\ncollapsibles would be carried, which could accommodate 1,178 people, only one-\nthird of _Titanic_ 's total capacity. At the time, the Board of Trade's\nregulations required British vessels over 10,000 tons to only carry 16\nlifeboats with a capacity of 990 occupants.[63]\n\nTherefore, the White Star Line actually provided more lifeboat accommodation\nthan was legally required.[66][f] At the time, lifeboats were intended to\nferry survivors from a sinking ship to a rescuing ship—not keep afloat the\nwhole population or power them to shore. Had the [SS\n_Californian_](/wiki/SS_Californian \"SS Californian\") responded to _Titanic\n'_s [distress calls](/wiki/Distress_signal \"Distress signal\"), the lifeboats\nmay have been adequate to ferry the passengers to safety as planned.[68]\n\n## Building and preparing the ship\n\n### Construction, launch and fitting-out\n\n![File:Titanic Disaster - Genuine Footage\n\\(1911-1912\\).webm](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Titanic_Disaster_-\n_Genuine_Footage_%281911-1912%29.webm/220px--Titanic_Disaster_-\n_Genuine_Footage_%281911-1912%29.webm.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Titanic_Disaster_-\n_Genuine_Footage_%281911-1912%29.webm \"Play media\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:Titanic_Disaster_-_Genuine_Footage_\\(1911-1912\\).webm \"Enlarge\")\n\nTitanic Disaster – Genuine Footage (1911–1912)\n\nThe sheer size of _Titanic_ and her sister ships posed a major engineering\nchallenge for Harland and Wolff; no shipbuilder had ever before attempted to\nconstruct vessels this size[69]. The ships were constructed on Queen's Island,\nnow known as the [Titanic Quarter](/wiki/Titanic_Quarter,_Belfast \"Titanic\nQuarter, Belfast\"), in [Belfast Harbour](/wiki/Port_of_Belfast \"Port of\nBelfast\"). Harland and Wolff had to demolish three existing\n[slipways](/wiki/Slipway \"Slipway\") and build two new ones, the largest ever\nconstructed up to that time, to accommodate both ships.[11] Their construction\nwas facilitated by an enormous gantry built by [Sir William Arrol &\nCo.](/wiki/Sir_William_Arrol_%26_Co. \"Sir William Arrol & Co.\"), a Scottish\nfirm responsible for the building of the [Forth Bridge](/wiki/Forth_Bridge\n\"Forth Bridge\") and London's [Tower Bridge](/wiki/Tower_Bridge \"Tower\nBridge\"). The Arrol Gantry stood 228 feet (69 m) high, was 270 feet (82 m)\nwide and 840 feet (260 m) long, and weighed more than 6,000 tons. It\naccommodated a number of mobile cranes. A separate floating crane, capable of\nlifting 200 tons, was brought in from Germany.[70]\n\nThe construction of _Olympic_ and _Titanic_ took place virtually in parallel,\nwith _Olympic_ 's keel laid down first on 16 December 1908 and _Titanic_ 's on\n31 March 1909.[16] Both ships took about 26 months to build and followed much\nthe same construction process. They were designed essentially as an enormous\nfloating [box girder](/wiki/Box_girder \"Box girder\"), with the\n[keel](/wiki/Keel \"Keel\") acting as a backbone and the frames of the hull\nforming the ribs. At the base of the ships, a double bottom 5 feet 3 inches\n(1.60 m) deep supported 300 frames, each between 24 inches (61 cm) and 36\ninches (91 cm) apart and measuring up to about 66 feet (20 m) long. They\nterminated at the bridge deck (B Deck) and were covered with steel plates\nwhich formed the outer skin of the ships.[71]\n\nThe 2,000 hull plates were single pieces of\n[rolled](/wiki/Rolling_\\(metalworking\\) \"Rolling \\(metalworking\\)\") steel\n[plate](/wiki/Structural_steel \"Structural steel\"), mostly up to 6 feet (1.8\nm) wide and 30 feet (9.1 m) long and weighing between 2.5 and 3 tons.[72]\nTheir thickness varied from 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).[41] The\nplates were laid in a [clinkered](/wiki/Clinker_\\(boat_building\\) \"Clinker\n\\(boat building\\)\") (overlapping) fashion from the keel to the bilge. Above\nthat point they were laid in the \"in and out\" fashion, where\n[strake](/wiki/Strake \"Strake\") plating was applied in bands (the \"in\nstrakes\") with the gaps covered by the \"out strakes\", overlapping on the\nedges. Commercial oxy-fuel and electric arc [welding](/wiki/Welding \"Welding\")\nmethods, ubiquitous in [fabrication](/wiki/Metal_fabrication \"Metal\nfabrication\") today, were still in their infancy; like most other iron and\nsteel structures of the era, the hull was held together with over three\nmillion iron and steel [rivets](/wiki/Rivet \"Rivet\"), which by themselves\nweighed over 1,200 tons. They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were\nhammered in by hand.[73] In the 1990s some material scientists concluded[74]\nthat the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle\nwhen cold, and that this brittleness exacerbated the impact damage and\nhastened the sinking. It is believed that, by the standards of the time, the\nsteel plate's [quality](/wiki/Quality_\\(business\\) \"Quality \\(business\\)\") was\ngood, not faulty, but that it was inferior to what would be used for\nshipbuilding purposes in later decades, owing to advances in the\n[metallurgy](/wiki/Metallurgy \"Metallurgy\") of [steelmaking](/wiki/Steelmaking\n\"Steelmaking\").[74] As for the rivets, considerable emphasis has also been\nplaced on their quality and strength.[75][76][77][78][79]\n\nOne of the last items to be fitted on _Titanic_ before the ship's launch was\nher two side anchors and one centre anchor. The anchors themselves were a\nchallenge to make with the centre anchor being the largest ever forged by hand\nand weighing nearly 16 tons. Twenty Clydesdale draught horses were needed to\nhaul the centre anchor by wagon from the [Noah Hingley & Sons\nLtd](/wiki/N._Hingley_%26_Sons_Ltd \"N. Hingley & Sons Ltd\") forge shop in\nNetherton, near Dudley, United Kingdom to the Dudley railway station two miles\naway. From there it was shipped by rail to Fleetwood in Lancashire before\nbeing loaded aboard a ship and sent to Belfast.[80]\n\nThe work of constructing the ships was difficult and dangerous. For the 15,000\nmen who worked at Harland and Wolff at the time,[81] safety precautions were\nrudimentary at best; a lot of the work was dangerous and was carried out\nwithout any safety equipment like hard hats or hand guards on machinery. As a\nresult, deaths and injuries were to be expected. During _Titanic_ 's\nconstruction, 246 injuries were recorded, 28 of them \"severe\", such as arms\nsevered by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel. Six people\ndied on the ship herself while she was being constructed and fitted out, and\nanother two died in the shipyard workshops and sheds.[82] Just before the\nlaunch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him.[83]\n\n_Titanic_ was launched at 12:15 p.m. on 31 May 1911 in the presence of Lord\nPirrie, J. Pierpoint Morgan, J. Bruce Ismay and 100,000 onlookers.[84] 22 tons\nof soap and tallow were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ship's passage\ninto the [River Lagan](/wiki/River_Lagan \"River Lagan\").[83] In keeping with\nthe White Star Line's traditional policy, the ship was not formally named or\nchristened with champagne.[84] The ship was towed to a fitting-out berth\nwhere, over the course of the next year, her engines, funnels and\nsuperstructure were installed and her interior was fitted out.[85]\n\nAlthough _Titanic_ was virtually identical to the class's lead ship _Olympic_\n, a few changes were made to distinguish both ships. The most noticeable of\nthese was that _Titanic_ (and the third vessel in class,\n[_Britannic_](/wiki/HMHS_Britannic \"HMHS Britannic\")) had a steel screen with\nsliding windows installed along the forward half of the A Deck promenade. This\nwas installed as a last minute change at the personal request of Bruce Ismay,\nand was intended to provide additional shelter to first class passengers.[86]\nThese changes made _Titanic_ slightly heavier than her sister, and thus she\ncould claim to be the largest ship afloat. The work took longer than expected\ndue to design changes requested by Ismay and a temporary pause in work\noccasioned by the need to repair _Olympic_ , which had been in a collision in\nSeptember 1911. Had _Titanic_ been finished earlier, she might well have\nmissed her collision with an iceberg.[83]\n\n|  [![Construction in gantry, bow is\nseen](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/RMS_Titanic_ready_for_launch%2C_1911.jpg/212px-\nRMS_Titanic_ready_for_launch%2C_1911.jpg)](/wiki/File:RMS_Titanic_ready_for_launch,_1911.jpg\n\"Construction in gantry, 1909–11\")  \n---  \nConstruction in gantry, 1909–11  \n[![Launch, 1911; ship with unfinished\nsuperstructure](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Titanic_launched_at_Belfast.jpg/232px-\nTitanic_launched_at_Belfast.jpg)](/wiki/File:Titanic_launched_at_Belfast.jpg\n\"Launch, 1911 \\(unfinished superstructure\\)\")  \n---  \nLaunch, 1911 (unfinished superstructure)  \n[![Fitting-out, 1911–12: Ship is seen in\ndock](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Titanic_under_construction.jpg/250px-\nTitanic_under_construction.jpg)](/wiki/File:Titanic_under_construction.jpg\n\"Fitting-out, 1911–12\")  \n---  \nFitting-out, 1911–12  \n  \n### Sea trials\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/RMS_Titanic_2.jpg/250px-\nRMS_Titanic_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:RMS_Titanic_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:RMS_Titanic_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRMS _Titanic_ leaving [Belfast](/wiki/Belfast,_Northern_Ireland \"Belfast,\nNorthern Ireland\") for her sea trials on 2 April 1912\n\n_Titanic_ 's sea trials began at 6 a.m. on Tuesday, 2 April 1912, just two\ndays after her fitting out was finished and eight days before she was due to\nleave Southampton on her maiden voyage.[87] The trials were delayed for a day\ndue to bad weather, but by Monday morning it was clear and fair.[88] Aboard\nwere 78 stokers, greasers and firemen, and 41 members of crew. No domestic\nstaff appear to have been aboard. Representatives of various companies\ntravelled on _Titanic_ 's sea trials, Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding of\nHarland and Wolff and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie\nwere too ill to attend. [Jack\nPhillips](/wiki/Jack_Phillips_\\(wireless_officer\\) \"Jack Phillips \\(wireless\nofficer\\)\") and [Harold Bride](/wiki/Harold_Bride \"Harold Bride\") served as\nradio operators, and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi equipment. Francis\nCarruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that\neverything worked, and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.[89]\n\nThe sea trials consisted of a number of tests of her handling characteristics,\ncarried out first in [Belfast Lough](/wiki/Belfast_Lough \"Belfast Lough\") and\nthen in the open waters of the [Irish Sea](/wiki/Irish_Sea \"Irish Sea\"). Over\nthe course of about 12 hours, _Titanic_ was driven at different speeds, the\nturning ability was tested and a \"crash stop\" was performed in which the\nengines were reversed full ahead to full astern, bringing her to a stop in 850\nyd (777 m) or 3 minutes and 15 seconds.[90] The ship covered a distance of\nabout 80 nautical miles (92 mi; 150 km), averaging 18 knots (21 mph; 33 km/h)\nand reaching a maximum speed of just under 21 knots (24 mph; 39 km/h).[91]\n\nOn returning to Belfast at about 7 p.m., the surveyor signed an \"Agreement and\nAccount of Voyages and Crew\", valid for 12 months, which declared the ship\nseaworthy. An hour later, _Titanic_ departed Belfast to head to Southampton, a\nvoyage of about 570 nautical miles (660 mi; 1,060 km). After a journey lasting\nabout 28 hours and arrived about midnight on 4 April and was towed to the\nport's Berth 44, ready for the arrival of her passengers and the remainder of\nher crew.[92]\n\n## Maiden voyage\n\nBoth _Olympic_ and _Titanic_ registered [Liverpool](/wiki/Liverpool\n\"Liverpool\") as their home port. The offices of the White Star Line as well as\nCunard were in Liverpool, and up until the introduction of the _Olympic_ ,\nmost British ocean liners for both Cunard and White Star, such as _Lusitania_\nand _Mauretania_ , sailed out of Liverpool followed by a port of call in\n[Queenstown, Ireland](/wiki/Queenstown,_Ireland \"Queenstown, Ireland\"). Since\nthe company's founding in 1871, a vast majority of their operations had taken\nplace out of Liverpool. However, in 1907 White Star established another\nservice out of the port of Southampton on England's south coast, which became\nknown as White Star's \"Express Service\". Southampton had many advantages over\nLiverpool, the first being its proximity to London.[93]\n\nIn addition, Southampton, being on the south coast, allowed ships to easily\ncross the [English Channel](/wiki/English_Channel \"English Channel\") and make\na port of call on the northern coast of France, usually at\n[Cherbourg](/wiki/Cherbourg \"Cherbourg\"). This allowed British ships to pick\nup clientele from continental Europe before recrossing the channel and picking\nup passengers at Queenstown. The _Southampton-Cherbourg-New York run_ would\nbecome so popular that most British ocean liners began using the port after\n[World War I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\"). Out of respect for Liverpool,\nships continued to be registered there until the early 1960s. _[Queen\nElizabeth 2](/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_2 \"Queen Elizabeth 2\")_ was one of the\nfirst ships registered in Southampton when introduced into service by Cunard\nin 1969.[93]\n\n_Titanic '_s maiden voyage was intended to be the first of many trans-Atlantic\ncrossings between Southampton and New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown on\nwestbound runs, returning via [Plymouth](/wiki/Plymouth \"Plymouth\") in England\nwhile eastbound. Indeed, her entire schedule of voyages through to December\n1912 still exists.[94] When the route was established, four ships were\nassigned to the service. In addition to _Teutonic_ and _Majestic_ , the [RMS\n_Oceanic_](/wiki/RMS_Oceanic_\\(1899\\) \"RMS Oceanic \\(1899\\)\") and the brand\nnew [RMS  _Adriatic_](/wiki/RMS_Adriatic_\\(1907\\) \"RMS Adriatic \\(1907\\)\")\nsailed the route. When the _Olympic_ entered service in June 1911, she\nreplaced _Teutonic_ , which after completing her last run on the service in\nlate April was transferred to the Dominion Line's Canadian service. The\nfollowing August, _Adriatic_ was transferred to White Star's main Liverpool-\nNew York service, and in November, _Majestic_ was withdrawn from service\nimpending the arrival of _Titanic_ in the coming months, and was mothballed as\na reserve ship.[95][96]\n\nWhite Star's initial plans for _Olympic_ and _Titanic_ on the Southampton run\nfollowed the same routine as their predecessors had done before them. Each\nwould sail once every three weeks from Southampton and New York, usually\nleaving at noon each Wednesday from Southampton and each Saturday from New\nYork, thus enabling the White Star Line to offer weekly sailings in each\ndirection. Special trains were scheduled from London and Paris to convey\npassengers to Southampton and Cherbourg respectively.[96] The deep-water dock\nat Southampton, then known as the \"_White Star Dock_ \", had been specially\nconstructed to accommodate the new _Olympic_ -class liners, and had opened in\n1911.[97]\n\n|  [![Photograph of a bearded man wearing a white captain's uniform, standing\non a ship with his arms\ncrossed](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/EJ_Smith.jpg/171px-\nEJ_Smith.jpg)](/wiki/File:EJ_Smith.jpg \"Edward Smith, captain of Titanic, in\n1911\")  \n---  \n[Edward Smith](/wiki/Edward_Smith_\\(sea_captain\\) \"Edward Smith \\(sea\ncaptain\\)\"), captain of _Titanic_ , in 1911  \n[![Titanic at Southampton docks, prior to departure seen from the\nbow](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Titanic.jpg/216px-\nTitanic.jpg)](/wiki/File:Titanic.jpg \"Titanic at Southampton docks, prior to\ndeparture\")  \n---  \n_Titanic_ at Southampton docks, prior to departure  \n[![Display ad for Titanic's first but never made sailing from New York on 20\nApril 20,\n1912](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/RMS_Titanic_Ad_April_10%2C_1912.jpg/238px-\nRMS_Titanic_Ad_April_10%2C_1912.jpg)](/wiki/File:RMS_Titanic_Ad_April_10,_1912.jpg\n\"Display ad for Titanic's first but never made sailing from New York on 20\nApril 1912\")  \n---  \nDisplay ad for _Titanic_ 's first but never made sailing from New York on 20\nApril 1912  \n  \n### Crew\n\nMain article: [Crew of the RMS Titanic](/wiki/Crew_of_the_RMS_Titanic \"Crew of\nthe RMS Titanic\")\n\n_Titanic_ had around 885 crew members on board for her maiden voyage.[98] Like\nother vessels of her time, she did not have a permanent crew, and the vast\nmajority of crew members were casual workers who only came aboard the ship a\nfew hours before she sailed from Southampton.[99] The process of signing up\nrecruits had begun on 23 March and some had been sent to Belfast, where they\nserved as a skeleton crew during _Titanic_ 's sea trials and passage to\nEngland at the start of April.[100]\n\nCaptain [Edward John Smith](/wiki/Edward_Smith_\\(sea_captain\\) \"Edward Smith\n\\(sea captain\\)\"), the most senior of the White Star Line's captains, was\ntransferred from _Olympic_ to take command of _Titanic_.[101] [Henry Tingle\nWilde](/wiki/Henry_Tingle_Wilde \"Henry Tingle Wilde\") also came across from\n_Olympic_ to take the post of [Chief Mate](/wiki/Chief_Mate \"Chief Mate\").\n_Titanic_ 's previously designated Chief Mate and First Officer, [William\nMcMaster Murdoch](/wiki/William_McMaster_Murdoch \"William McMaster Murdoch\")\nand [Charles Lightoller](/wiki/Charles_Lightoller \"Charles Lightoller\"), were\nbumped down to the ranks of First and Second Officer respectively. The\noriginal Second Officer, [David Blair](/wiki/David_Blair_\\(mariner\\) \"David\nBlair \\(mariner\\)\"), was dropped altogether.[102][g] The [Third\nOfficer](/wiki/Third_mate \"Third mate\") was [Herbert\nPitman](/wiki/Herbert_Pitman \"Herbert Pitman\") [MBE](/wiki/MBE \"MBE\"), the\nonly deck officer who was not a member of the [Royal Naval\nReserve](/wiki/Royal_Naval_Reserve \"Royal Naval Reserve\"). Pitman was the\nsecond to last surviving officer.\n\n_Titanic_ 's crew were divided into three principal departments: Deck, with 66\ncrew; Engine, with 325; and Victualling (pronounced _vi-tal-ling_), with\n494.[103] The vast majority of the crew were thus not seamen, but were either\nengineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines, or\nstewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers.[104] Of these, over\n97% were male; just 23 of the crew were female, mainly stewardesses.[105] The\nrest represented a great variety of professions—bakers, chefs, butchers,\nfishmongers, dishwashers, stewards, gymnasium instructors, laundrymen,\nwaiters, bed-makers, cleaners, and even a printer,[105] who produced a daily\nnewspaper for passengers called the _Atlantic Daily Bulletin_ with the latest\nnews received by the ship's wireless operators.[45][h]\n\nMost of the crew signed on in Southampton on 6 April;[16] in all, 699 of the\ncrew came from there, and 40% were natives of the town.[105] A few specialist\nstaff were self-employed or were subcontractors. These included the five\npostal clerks, who worked for the Royal Mail and the United States Post Office\nDepartment, the staff of the First Class _A La Carte_ Restaurant and the Café\nParisien, the radio operators (who were employed by Marconi) and the eight\nmusicians, who were employed by an agency and travelled as second-class\npassengers.[107] Crew pay varied greatly, from Captain Smith's £105 a month\n(equivalent to £9,400 today) to the £3 10 _[s](/wiki/Shilling_\\(British_coin\\)\n\"Shilling \\(British coin\\)\")_ (£310 today) that stewardesses earned. The\nlower-paid victualling staff could, however, supplement their wages\nsubstantially through tips from passengers.[106]\n\n### Passengers\n\nMain article: [Passengers of the RMS\nTitanic](/wiki/Passengers_of_the_RMS_Titanic \"Passengers of the RMS Titanic\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/John_Jacob_Astor_1909.jpg/170px-\nJohn_Jacob_Astor_1909.jpg)](/wiki/File:John_Jacob_Astor_1909.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:John_Jacob_Astor_1909.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[John Jacob Astor IV](/wiki/John_Jacob_Astor_IV \"John Jacob Astor IV\") in\n1909. He was the wealthiest person aboard _Titanic_.\n\n_Titanic_ 's passengers numbered approximately 1,317 people: 324 in First\nClass, 284 in Second Class, and 709 in Third Class. Of these, 869 (66%) were\nmale and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard, the largest number\nof which were in Third Class.[108] The ship was considerably under capacity on\nher maiden voyage, as she could accommodate 2,453 passengers—833 First Class,\n614 Second Class, and 1,006 Third Class.[109]\n\nUsually, a high prestige vessel like _Titanic_ could expect to be fully booked\non its maiden voyage. However, a [national coal\nstrike](/wiki/National_coal_strike_of_1912 \"National coal strike of 1912\") in\nthe UK had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules in the spring\nof 1912, causing many crossings to be cancelled. Many would-be passengers\nchose to postpone their travel plans until the strike was over. The strike had\nfinished a few days before _Titanic_ sailed; however, that was too late to\nhave much of an effect. _Titanic_ was able to sail on the scheduled date only\nbecause coal was transferred from other vessels which were tied up at\nSouthampton, such as [SS  _City of New York_](/wiki/SS_City_of_New_York \"SS\nCity of New York\") and [RMS  _Oceanic_](/wiki/RMS_Oceanic_\\(1899\\) \"RMS\nOceanic \\(1899\\)\"), as well as coal _Olympic_ had brought back from a previous\nvoyage to New York, which had been stored at the White Star Dock.[86]\n\nSome of the most prominent people of the day booked a passage aboard _Titanic_\n, travelling in First Class.

Bruce Ismay](/wiki/J._Bruce_Ismay \"J. Bruce Ismay\") and _Titanic_ 's\ndesigner [Thomas Andrews](/wiki/Thomas_Andrews_\\(shipbuilder\\) \"Thomas Andrews\n\\(shipbuilder\\)\"), who was on board to observe any problems and assess the\ngeneral performance of the new ship.[112]\n\nThe exact number of people aboard is not known, as not all of those who had\nbooked tickets made it to the ship; about 50 people cancelled for various\nreasons,[113] and not all of those who boarded stayed aboard for the entire\njourney.[114] Fares varied depending on class and season. Third Class fares\nfrom London, Southampton, or Queenstown cost £7 5 _s_ (equivalent to £600\ntoday) while the cheapest First Class fares cost £23 (£2,100 today).[96] The\nmost expensive First Class suites were to have cost up to £870 in high season\n(£78,000 today).[109]\n\n### Collecting passengers\n\nOn Wednesday 10 April 1912 _Titanic_ 's maiden voyage began. Following the\nembarkation of the crew the passengers began arriving from 9:30 a.m., when the\n[London and South Western Railway](/wiki/London_and_South_Western_Railway\n\"London and South Western Railway\")'s boat train from [London Waterloo\nstation](/wiki/London_Waterloo_station \"London Waterloo station\") reached\n[Southampton Terminus railway\nstation](/wiki/Southampton_Terminus_railway_station \"Southampton Terminus\nrailway station\") on the quayside, alongside _Titanic_ 's berth.[115] In all,\n923 passengers boarded _Titanic_ at Southampton, 179 First Class, 247 Second\nClass and 494 Third Class. The large number of Third Class passengers meant\nthey were the first to board, with First and Second Class passengers following\nup to an hour before departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins, and\nFirst Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith on\nboarding.[116] Third Class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical\nimpairments that might lead to their being refused entry to the United States\n– a prospect the White Star Line wished to avoid, as it would have to carry\nanyone who failed the examination back across the Atlantic.[113] 922\npassengers were recorded as having embarked _Titanic_ at Southampton.\nAdditional passengers were to be picked up at [Cherbourg](/wiki/Cherbourg\n\"Cherbourg\") and [Queenstown](/wiki/Cobh \"Cobh\").[86]\n\nThe maiden voyage began on time, at noon. An accident was narrowly averted\nonly a few minutes later as _Titanic_ passed the moored liners [SS  _City of\nNew York_](/wiki/SS_City_of_New_York \"SS City of New York\") of the [American\nLine](/wiki/American_Line \"American Line\") and what would have been her\nrunning mate on the service from Southampton, White Star's _Oceanic_. Her huge\ndisplacement caused both of the smaller ships to be lifted by a bulge of water\nand then drop into a trough. _New York_ 's mooring cables could not take the\nsudden strain and snapped, swinging her around stern-first towards _Titanic_.\nA nearby tugboat, _Vulcan_ , came to the rescue by taking _New York_ under\ntow, and Captain Smith ordered _Titanic_ 's engines to be put \"full\nastern\".[117] The two ships avoided a collision by a matter of about 4 feet\n(1.2 m). The incident delayed _Titanic_ 's departure for about an hour, while\nthe drifting _New York_ was brought under control.[118]\n\nAfter making it safely through the complex tides and channels of [Southampton\nWater](/wiki/Southampton_Water \"Southampton Water\") and the\n[Solent](/wiki/Solent \"Solent\"), _Titanic_ headed out into the [English\nChannel](/wiki/English_Channel \"English Channel\"). She headed for the French\nport of Cherbourg, a journey of 77 nautical miles (89 mi; 143 km).[119] The\nweather was windy, very fine but cold and overcast.[120] Because Cherbourg\nlacked docking facilities for a ship the size of _Titanic_ ,\n[tenders](/wiki/Ship%27s_tender \"Ship's tender\") had to be used to transfer\npassengers from shore to ship. The White Star Line operated two at Cherbourg,\nthe [SS  _Traffic_](/wiki/SS_Traffic_\\(1911\\) \"SS Traffic \\(1911\\)\") and the\n[SS  _Nomadic_](/wiki/SS_Nomadic_\\(1911\\) \"SS Nomadic \\(1911\\)\"). Both had\nbeen designed specifically as tenders for the _Olympic_ -class liners and were\nlaunched shortly after _Titanic_.[121] (_Nomadic_ is today the only White Star\nLine ship still afloat.) Four hours after _Titanic_ left Southampton, she\narrived at Cherbourg and was met by the tenders. 274 additional passengers\nwere taken aboard, 142 First Class, 30 Second Class, and 102 Third Class.\nTwenty-four passengers who had booked passage only cross-channel from\nSouthampton left aboard the tenders to be conveyed to shore. The process was\ncompleted within only 90 minutes and at 8 p.m. _Titanic_ [weighed\nanchor](/wiki/Weigh_anchor \"Weigh anchor\") and left for Queenstown[122] with\nthe weather continuing cold and windy.[120]\n\nAt 11:30 a.m. on Thursday 11 April, _Titanic_ arrived at [Cork\nHarbour](/wiki/Cork_Harbour \"Cork Harbour\") on the south coast of Ireland. It\nwas a partly cloudy but relatively warm day, with a brisk wind.[120] Again,\nthe dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of _Titanic '_s size, and\ntenders were used to bring passengers aboard. In all, 123 passengers boarded\n_Titanic_ at Queenstown, 3 First Class, 7 Second Class and 113 Third Class.

From there she travelled 1,620 nautical\nmiles (1,860 mi; 3,000 km) along a [Great Circle](/wiki/Great_Circle \"Great\nCircle\") route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as\n\"the corner\" south-east of Newfoundland, where westbound steamers carried out\na change of course. _Titanic_ sailed only a few hours past the corner on a\n[rhumb line](/wiki/Rhumb_line \"Rhumb line\") leg of 1,023 nautical miles (1,177\nmi; 1,895 km) to [Nantucket Shoals](/wiki/Nantucket_Shoals \"Nantucket Shoals\")\nLight when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg.[127] The final leg of\nthe journey would have been 193 nautical miles (222 mi; 357 km) to [Ambrose\nLight](/wiki/Ambrose_Light \"Ambrose Light\") and finally to [New York\nHarbor](/wiki/New_York_Harbor \"New York Harbor\").[128]\n\nFrom 11 April to [local apparent noon](/wiki/Local_apparent_time \"Local\napparent time\") the next day, _Titanic_ covered 484 nautical miles (557 mi;\n896 km); the following day, 519 nautical miles (597 mi; 961 km); and by noon\non the final day of her voyage, 546 nautical miles (628 mi; 1,011 km). From\nthen until the time of her sinking she travelled another 258 nautical miles\n(297 mi; 478 km), averaging about 21 knots (24 mph; 39 km/h).[129]\n\nThe weather cleared as she left Ireland under cloudy skies with a headwind.\nTemperatures remained fairly mild on Saturday 13 April, but the following day\n_Titanic_ crossed a cold [weather front](/wiki/Weather_front \"Weather front\")\nwith strong winds and waves of up to 8 feet (2.4 m). These died down as the\nday progressed until, by the evening of Sunday 14 April, it became clear, calm\nand very cold.[130]\n\nThe first three days of the voyage from Queenstown had passed without apparent\nincident. A fire had begun in one of _Titanic '_s [coal\nbunkers](/wiki/Coal_bunker \"Coal bunker\") approximately 10 days prior to the\nship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into its voyage,[131]\nbut passengers were unaware of this situation. Fires occurred frequently on\nboard steamships of that day due to [spontaneous\ncombustion](/wiki/Spontaneous_combustion \"Spontaneous combustion\") of the\ncoal.[132] The fires had to be extinguished with fire hoses, by moving the\ncoal on top to another bunker and by removing the burning coal and feeding it\ninto the furnace.[133] Fortunately, the fire was over on 14 April.[134][135]\n\n_Titanic_ received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in\nthe area of the [Grand Banks of\nNewfoundland](/wiki/Grand_Banks_of_Newfoundland \"Grand Banks of\nNewfoundland\").[136] One of the ships to warn _Titanic_ was the Atlantic\nLine's [_Mesaba_](/w/index.php?title=SS_Mesaba_\\(1897\\)&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"SS Mesaba \\(1897\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\").[137] Nevertheless, the ship\ncontinued to steam at full speed, which was standard practice at the\ntime.[138] Although the ship was not trying to set a speed record,[139]\ntimekeeping was a priority, and under prevailing maritime practices, ships\nwere often operated at close to full speed, with ice warnings seen as\nadvisories and reliance placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge.[138]\nIt was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels. Close\ncalls with ice were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been\ndisastrous. In 1907 [SS  _Kronprinz Wilhelm_](/wiki/SS_Kronprinz_Wilhelm \"SS\nKronprinz Wilhelm\"), a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but still had been\nable to complete her voyage, and Captain Smith himself had declared in 1907\nthat he \"could not imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder.\nModern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.\"[140][j]\n\n### Sinking\n\nMain article: [Sinking of the RMS _Titanic_](/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic\n\"Sinking of the RMS Titanic\")\n\nAt 11:40 p.m. ([ship's time](/wiki/Ship%27s_time \"Ship's time\")) on 14 April,\nlookout [Frederick Fleet](/wiki/Frederick_Fleet \"Frederick Fleet\") spotted an\niceberg immediately ahead of _Titanic_ and alerted the bridge.[143] [First\nOfficer](/wiki/Chief_mate \"Chief mate\") [William\nMurdoch](/wiki/William_McMaster_Murdoch \"William McMaster Murdoch\") ordered\nthe ship to be steered around the obstacle and the engines to be stopped,[144]\nbut it was too late; the starboard side of _Titanic_ struck the iceberg,\ncreating a series of holes below the waterline.[k] The hull was not punctured\nby the iceberg, but rather dented such that the hull's seams buckled and\nseparated, allowing water to seep in. Five of the ship's watertight\ncompartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as\nshe could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. _Titanic_\nbegan sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment\nas her angle in the water became steeper.[146]\n\nThose aboard _Titanic_ were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance\nwith accepted practices of the time, where ships were seen as largely\nunsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue\nvessels,[147][l] _Titanic_ only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of\nthose on board; if the ship had carried her full complement of about 3,339\npassengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the\nlifeboats.[149] The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an\nevacuation. The officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard\nthe lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full.[150] Third-class\npassengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to\nbecome trapped below decks as the ship filled with water.[151] The \"[women and\nchildren first](/wiki/Women_and_children_first \"Women and children first\")\"\nprotocol was generally followed when loading the lifeboats,[151] and most of\nthe male passengers and crew were left aboard.\n\nAt 2:20 a.m., two hours and 40 minutes after _Titanic_ struck the iceberg, her\nrate of sinking suddenly increased as her forward deck dipped underwater, and\nthe sea poured in through open hatches and grates.[152] As her unsupported\nstern rose out of the water, exposing the propellers, the ship began to break\nin two between the third and fourth funnels, due to the immense forces on the\nkeel.[153] With the bow underwater, and air trapped in the stern, the stern\nremained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer, rising to a nearly\nvertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it,[154] before\nsinking. For many years it was generally believed the ship sank in one piece;\nhowever, when [the wreck was located](/wiki/Wreck_of_the_RMS_Titanic \"Wreck of\nthe RMS Titanic\") many years later, it was discovered that the ship had fully\nbroken in two. All remaining passengers and crew were immersed into lethally\ncold water with a temperature of 28 °F (−2 °C).[m] Almost all of those in the\nwater died of cardiac arrest or other bodily reactions to freezing water,\nwithin 15–30 minutes.[157] Only 13 of them were helped into the lifeboats,\nthough these had room for almost 500 more people.[158]\n\nDistress signals were sent by wireless, rockets, and lamp, but none of the\nships that responded was near enough to reach _Titanic_ before she sank.[159]\nA radio operator on board the [_Birma_](/wiki/Russian_American_Line \"Russian\nAmerican Line\"), for instance, estimated that it would be 6 a.m. before the\nliner could arrive at the scene. Meanwhile, the [SS\n_Californian_](/wiki/SS_Californian \"SS Californian\"), which was the last to\nhave been in contact before the collision, saw _Titanic_ 's flares but failed\nto assist.[160] Around 4 a.m., [RMS  _Carpathia_](/wiki/RMS_Carpathia \"RMS\nCarpathia\") arrived on the scene in response to _Titanic_ 's earlier distress\ncalls.[161]\n\nAbout 710 people survived the disaster and were conveyed by _Carpathia_ to New\nYork, _Titanic_ 's original destination, while at least 1,500 people lost\ntheir lives.[98] _Carpathia_ 's captain described the place as an ice field\nthat had included 20 large bergs measuring up to 200 feet (61 m) high and\nnumerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from _Titanic_ ;\npassengers described being in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded\nwith icebergs.[162] This area is now known as [Iceberg\nAlley](/wiki/Iceberg_Alley \"Iceberg Alley\").[163]\n\n|  [![Drawing of sinking in four steps from eye witness\ndescription](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Thayer-\nSketch-of-Titanic.png/240px-Thayer-Sketch-of-Titanic.png)](/wiki/File:Thayer-\nSketch-of-Titanic.png \"The sinking, according to J.

Her journey was slowed\nby pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas.[164] She was, however, able to\npass news to the outside world by wireless about what had happened. The\ninitial reports were confused, leading the American press to report\nerroneously on 15 April that _Titanic_ was being towed to port by the [SS\n_Virginian_](/wiki/SS_Virginian \"SS Virginian\").[165]\n\nLater that day, confirmation came through that _Titanic_ had been lost and\nthat most of her passengers and crew had died.[166] The news attracted crowds\nof people to the White Star Line's offices in London, New York, Montreal,[167]\nSouthampton,[168] Liverpool and Belfast.[169] It hit hardest in Southampton,\nwhose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking.[170] Four out of\nevery five crew members came from this town.[171][n]\n\n_Carpathia_ docked at 9:30 p.m. on 18 April at New York's [Pier\n54](/wiki/Pier_54 \"Pier 54\") and was greeted by some 40,000 people waiting at\nthe quayside in heavy rain.[174] Immediate relief in the form of clothing and\ntransportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the\n[Travelers Aid Society of New York](/wiki/Travelers_Aid_Society_of_New_York\n\"Travelers Aid Society of New York\"), and the [Council of Jewish\nWomen](/wiki/National_Council_of_Jewish_Women \"National Council of Jewish\nWomen\"), among other organisations.[175] Many of _Titanic_ 's surviving\npassengers did not linger in New York but headed onwards immediately to\nrelatives' homes. Some of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to\ntake them home, and the [Pennsylvania Railroad](/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad\n\"Pennsylvania Railroad\") laid on a special train free of charge to take\nsurvivors to [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\"). _Titanic_ 's\n214 surviving crew members were taken to the [Red Star\nLine](/wiki/Red_Star_Line \"Red Star Line\")'s steamer [SS\n_Lapland_](/wiki/SS_Lapland \"SS Lapland\"), where they were accommodated in\npassenger cabins.[176]\n\n_Carpathia_ was hurriedly restocked with food and provisions before resuming\nher journey to [Fiume](/wiki/Rijeka \"Rijeka\"), [Austria-\nHungary](/wiki/Austria-Hungary \"Austria-Hungary\"). Her crew were given a bonus\nof a month's wages by Cunard as a reward for their actions, and some of\n_Titanic_ 's passengers joined together to give them an additional bonus of\nnearly £900 (£80,000 today), divided among the crew members.[177]\n\nThe ship's arrival in New York led to a frenzy of press interest, with\nnewspapers competing to be the first to report the survivors' stories. Some\nreporters bribed their way aboard the [pilot boat](/wiki/Pilot_boat \"Pilot\nboat\") _New York_ , which guided _Carpathia_ into harbour, and one even\nmanaged to get onto _Carpathia_ before she docked.[178] Crowds gathered\noutside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the\nwindows or on billboards.[179] It took another four days for a complete list\nof casualties to be compiled and released, adding to the agony of relatives\nwaiting for news of those who had been aboard _Titanic_.[o]\n\n|  [![A man wearing a bowler hat and a woman in a shawl embrace among a crowd\nof people standing in a wooden\nbuilding](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Arrival_of_the_ship_of_sorrow.jpg/144px-\nArrival_of_the_ship_of_sorrow.jpg)](/wiki/File:Arrival_of_the_ship_of_sorrow.jpg\n\"Arrival of Titanic's survivors at New York \\(artist concept\\)\")  \n---  \nArrival of _Titanic_ 's survivors at New York (artist concept)[p]  \n[![1912 cartoon.

The total coverage was £1,000,000 (£89,000,000 today) per ship. The\npolicy was to be \"free from all average\" under £150,000, meaning that the\ninsurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum. The premium,\nnegotiated by brokers Willis Faber & Company (now [Willis\nGroup](/wiki/Willis_Group \"Willis Group\")), was 15 _s_ (75 _p_) per £100, or\n£7,500 (£670,000 today) for the term of one year. Lloyd's paid the White Star\nLine the full sum owed to them within 30 days.[181]\n\nMany charities were set up to help the victims and their families, many of\nwhom lost their sole breadwinner, or, in the case of many Third Class\nsurvivors, everything they owned. On 29 April opera stars [Enrico\nCaruso](/wiki/Enrico_Caruso \"Enrico Caruso\") and [Mary\nGarden](/wiki/Mary_Garden \"Mary Garden\") and members of the [Metropolitan\nOpera](/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera \"Metropolitan Opera\") raised $12,000 ($300,000\nin 2014)[182] in benefits for victims of the disaster by giving special\nconcerts in which versions of \"Autumn\" and \"Nearer My God To Thee\" were part\nof the programme.[183] In Britain, relief funds were organised for the\nfamilies of _Titanic_ 's lost crew members, raising nearly £450,000\n(£40,000,000 today). One such fund was still in operation as late as the\n1960s.[184]\n\n### Investigations into the disaster\n\nMain articles: [United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS\nTitanic](/wiki/United_States_Senate_inquiry_into_the_sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic\n\"United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic\") and\n[British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS\nTitanic](/wiki/British_Wreck_Commissioner%27s_inquiry_into_the_sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic\n\"British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic\")\n\nEven before the survivors arrived in New York, investigations were being\nplanned to discover what had happened, and what could be done to prevent a\nrecurrence. Inquiries were held in both the United States and United Kingdom,\nthe former more robustly critical of traditions and practices, and scathing of\nthe failures involved, and the latter broadly more technical and expert-\noriented.[185]\n\nThe [U.S. Senate's inquiry into the\ndisaster](/wiki/United_States_Senate_inquiry_into_the_sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic\n\"United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic\") was\ninitiated on 19 April, a day after _Carpathia_ arrived in New York.[186] The\nchairman, Senator [William Alden Smith](/wiki/William_Alden_Smith \"William\nAlden Smith\"), wanted to gather accounts from passengers and crew while the\nevents were still fresh in their minds. Smith also needed to subpoena all\nsurviving British passengers and crew while they were still on American soil,\nwhich prevented them from returning to the UK before the American inquiry was\ncompleted on 25 May.[187] The British press condemned Smith as an opportunist,\ninsensitively forcing an inquiry as a means of gaining political prestige and\nseizing \"his moment to stand on the world stage\". Smith, however, already had\na reputation as a campaigner for safety on U.S. railroads, and wanted to\ninvestigate any possible malpractices by railroad tycoon J. P. Morgan,\n_Titanic_ 's ultimate owner.[188]\n\nThe [British Board of Trade's inquiry into the\ndisaster](/wiki/British_Wreck_Commissioner%27s_inquiry_into_the_sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic\n\"British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic\")\nwas headed by [Lord Mersey](/wiki/John_Bigham,_1st_Viscount_Mersey \"John\nBigham, 1st Viscount Mersey\"), and took place between 2 May and 3 July. Being\nrun by the Board of Trade, who had previously approved the ship, it was seen\nby some as having little interest in its own or White Star's conduct being\nfound negligent.[189]\n\nEach inquiry took testimony from both passengers and crew of _Titanic_ , crew\nmembers of Leyland Line's _Californian_ , Captain [Arthur\nRostron](/wiki/Arthur_Rostron \"Arthur Rostron\") of _Carpathia_ and other\nexperts.[190] The British inquiry also took far greater expert testimony,\nmaking it the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up\nto that time.[191] The two inquiries reached broadly similar conclusions: the\nregulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of\ndate and inadequate,[192] Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice\nwarnings,[193] the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed, and the\ncollision was the direct result of steaming into a dangerous area at too high\na speed.[192]\n\nNeither inquiry's findings listed negligence by IMM or the White Star Line as\na factor. The American inquiry concluded that since those involved had\nfollowed standard practice the disaster was an [act of God](/wiki/Act_of_God\n\"Act of God\").[194] The British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed\nlong-standing practice that had not previously been shown to be unsafe,[195]\nnoting that British ships alone had carried 3.5 million passengers over the\nprevious decade with the loss of just 10 lives,[196] and concluded that Smith\nhad done \"only that which other skilled men would have done in the same\nposition\". Lord Mersey did however find fault with the \"extremely high speed\n(twenty-two knots) which was maintained\" following numerous ice warnings,[197]\nnoting that without hindsight, \"what was a mistake in the case of the\n_Titanic_ would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the\nfuture\".[195]\n\nThe recommendations included strong suggestions for major changes in maritime\nregulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more\nlifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and\nthat wireless equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock.[198]\nAn [International Ice Patrol](/wiki/International_Ice_Patrol \"International\nIce Patrol\") was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North\nAtlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally\nthrough the [International Convention for the Safety of Life at\nSea](/wiki/International_Convention_for_the_Safety_of_Life_at_Sea\n\"International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea\"); both measures are\nstill in force today.[199]\n\nOn 18 June 1912, [Guglielmo Marconi](/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi \"Guglielmo\nMarconi\") gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry regarding the telegraphy. Its\nfinal report recommended that all liners carry the system and that sufficient\noperators maintain a constant service.[200]\n\n#### Role of the SS _Californian_\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Californian.jpg/250px-\nCalifornian.jpg)](/wiki/File:Californian.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Californian.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [SS  _Californian_](/wiki/SS_Californian \"SS Californian\"), which had\ntried to warn _Titanic_ of the danger from pack-ice\n\nOne of the most controversial issues examined by the inquiries was the role\nplayed by [SS  _Californian_](/wiki/SS_Californian \"SS Californian\"), which\nhad been only a few miles from _Titanic_ but had not picked up her distress\ncalls or responded to her signal rockets. _Californian_ had warned _Titanic_\nby radio of the pack ice that was the reason _Californian_ had stopped for the\nnight, but was rebuked by _Titanic_ 's senior wireless operator, [Jack\nPhillips](/wiki/Jack_Phillips_\\(wireless_officer\\) \"Jack Phillips \\(wireless\nofficer\\)\").[201]\n\nTestimony before the British inquiry revealed that at 10:10 p.m.,\n_Californian_ observed the lights of a ship to the south; it was later agreed\nbetween Captain [Stanley Lord](/wiki/Stanley_Lord \"Stanley Lord\") and Third\nOfficer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10 p.m.) that this\nwas a passenger liner.[201] At 11:50 p.m., the officer had watched that ship's\nlights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port\nlight was now visible.[201] Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's\norder, were made between 11:30 p.m. and 1:00 a.m., but were not\nacknowledged.[202] If _Titanic_ were as far from the _Californian_ as Lord\nclaimed, then he knew, or should have known, that Morse signals would not be\nvisible. A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken\nthe wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact _Titanic_ by\nthat method. Had Lord done so, it is possible he could have reached _Titanic_\nin time to save additional lives.[68]\n\nCaptain Lord had gone to the chartroom at 11:00 p.m. to spend the night;[203]\nhowever, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10 a.m.\nthat the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company\nsignals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said that he\ndid not know and that the rockets were all white. Captain Lord instructed the\ncrew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back\nto sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50 a.m. and Stone noted that\nthe ship looked strange in the water, as if she were\n[listing](/wiki/Angle_of_list \"Angle of list\"). At 2:15 a.m., Lord was\nnotified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights\nhad had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all\nwhite.[204]\n\n_Californian_ eventually responded. At around 5:30 a.m., Chief Officer George\nStewart awakened wireless operator [Cyril Furmstone\nEvans](/wiki/Cyril_Furmstone_Evans \"Cyril Furmstone Evans\"), informed him that\nrockets had been seen during the night, and asked that he try to communicate\nwith any ship. He got news of _Titanic_ 's loss, Captain Lord was notified,\nand the ship set out to render assistance. She arrived well after _Carpathia_\nhad already picked up all the survivors.[205]\n\nThe inquiries found that the ship seen by _Californian_ was in fact _Titanic_\nand that it would have been possible for _Californian_ to come to her rescue;\ntherefore, Captain Lord had acted improperly in failing to do so.[206][q]\n\n### Survivors and victims\n\nMain article: [List of Titanic passengers](/wiki/List_of_Titanic_passengers\n\"List of Titanic passengers\")\n\nThe number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, due to a number of\nfactors. These include confusion over the passenger list, which included some\nnames of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that\nseveral passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were\ntherefore double-counted on the casualty lists.[208] The death toll has been\nput at between 1,490 and 1,635 people.[209] The tables below use figures from\nthe British [Board of Trade](/wiki/Board_of_Trade \"Board of Trade\") report on\nthe disaster.[98]\n\nFewer than a third of those aboard _Titanic_ survived the disaster. Some\nsurvivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused\nthe deaths of several of those brought aboard _Carpathia_.[210] The figures\nshow stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard\n_Titanic_. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in\nthird class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class\nchildren survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. The differences\nby gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first and second\nclass passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at a higher rate\nthan women from the Third Class.[211] In total, 50% of the children survived,\n20% of the men and 75% of the women.\n\nThe last living survivor, [Millvina Dean](/wiki/Millvina_Dean \"Millvina Dean\")\nfrom England, who at only nine weeks old was the youngest passenger on board,\ndied aged 97 on 31 May 2009.[212] A special survivor was crew member [Violet\nJessop](/wiki/Violet_Jessop \"Violet Jessop\") who survived the sinkings of both\n_Titanic_ and _Britannic_ and was aboard _Olympic_ when she was rammed in\n1911.[213]\n\nAge/gender | Class/crew | Number aboard | Number saved | Number lost | Percentage saved | Percentage lost  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nChildren | First Class | 6 | 5 | 1 | 83% | 17%  \nSecond Class | 24 | 24 | 0 | 100% | 0%  \nThird Class | 79 | 27 | 52 | 34% | 66%  \nWomen | First Class | 144 | 140 | 4 | 97% | 3%  \nSecond Class | 93 | 80 | 13 | 86% | 14%  \nThird Class | 165 | 76 | 89 | 46% | 54%  \nCrew | 23 | 20 | 3 | 87% | 13%  \nMen | First Class | 175 | 57 | 118 | 33% | 67%  \nSecond Class | 168 | 14 | 154 | 8% | 92%  \nThird Class | 462 | 75 | 387 | 16% | 84%  \nCrew | 885 | 192 | 693 | 22% | 78%  \nTotal | 2224 | 710 | 1514 | 32% | 68%  \n  \n### Retrieval and burial of the dead\n\n[![Photograph](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/RMS_Titanic_Graves_in_Fairview_Cemetery.jpg/250px-\nRMS_Titanic_Graves_in_Fairview_Cemetery.jpg)](/wiki/File:RMS_Titanic_Graves_in_Fairview_Cemetery.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:RMS_Titanic_Graves_in_Fairview_Cemetery.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMarkers of _Titanic_ victims, [Fairview\nCemetery](/wiki/Fairview_Cemetery,_Halifax,_Nova_Scotia \"Fairview Cemetery,\nHalifax, Nova Scotia\"), Halifax, Nova Scotia\n\nOnce the massive loss of life became known, White Star Line chartered the\ncable ship [CS _Mackay-Bennett_](/wiki/CS_Mackay-Bennett \"CS Mackay-Bennett\")\nfrom [Halifax, Nova Scotia](/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia \"Halifax, Nova\nScotia\"), [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\"), to retrieve bodies.[214] Three\nother Canadian ships followed in the search: the cable ship _Minia_ ,[215]\nlighthouse supply ship _Montmagny_ and [sealing vessel](/wiki/Seal_hunting\n\"Seal hunting\") _Algerine_.[216] Each ship left with embalming supplies,\nundertakers, and clergy. Of the 333 victims that were eventually recovered,\n328 were retrieved by the Canadian ships and five more by passing North\nAtlantic steamships.[217][r]\n\nThe first ship to reach the site of the sinking, the CS  _Mackay-Bennett_ ,\nfound so many bodies that the embalming supplies aboard were quickly\nexhausted. Health regulations required that only embalmed bodies could be\nreturned to port.[219] Captain Larnder of the _Mackay-Bennett_ and undertakers\naboard decided to preserve only the bodies of first class passengers,\njustifying their decision by the need to visually identify wealthy men to\nresolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, many third class\npassengers and crew were buried at sea. Larnder identified many of those\nburied at sea as crew members by their clothing, and stated that as a mariner,\nhe himself would be contented to be buried at sea.[220]\n\nBodies recovered were preserved for transport to Halifax, the closest city to\nthe sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. The Halifax coroner,\n[John Henry\nBarnstead](/w/index.php?title=John_Henry_Barnstead&action=edit&redlink=1 \"John\nHenry Barnstead \\(page does not exist\\)\"), developed a detailed system to\nidentify bodies and safeguard personal possessions. Relatives from across\nNorth America came to identify and claim bodies. A large temporary morgue was\nset up in the [curling](/wiki/Curling \"Curling\") rink of the [Mayflower\nCurling Club](/wiki/Mayflower_Curling_Club \"Mayflower Curling Club\") and\nundertakers were called in from all across eastern Canada to assist.[220] Some\nbodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and\nEurope. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Unidentified victims\nwere buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were\ndiscovered. The majority of recovered victims, 150 bodies, were buried in\nthree Halifax cemeteries, the largest being [Fairview Lawn\nCemetery](/wiki/Fairview_Cemetery,_Halifax,_Nova_Scotia \"Fairview Cemetery,\nHalifax, Nova Scotia\") followed by the nearby [Mount\nOlivet](/wiki/Mount_Olivet_Cemetery_\\(Halifax\\) \"Mount Olivet Cemetery\n\\(Halifax\\)\") and [Baron de Hirsch](/wiki/Baron_de_Hirsch_Cemetery,_Halifax\n\"Baron de Hirsch Cemetery, Halifax\") cemeteries.[221]\n\nIn mid-May 1912, [RMS  _Oceanic_](/wiki/RMS_Oceanic_\\(1899\\) \"RMS Oceanic\n\\(1899\\)\") recovered three bodies over 200 miles (320 km) from the site of the\nsinking who were among the original occupants of Collapsible A. When Fifth\nOfficer [Harold Lowe](/wiki/Harold_Lowe \"Harold Lowe\") and six crewmen\nreturned to the wreck site sometime after the sinking in a lifeboat to pick up\nsurvivors, they rescued a dozen males and one female from Collapsible A, but\nleft the dead bodies of three of its occupants.[s] After their retrieval from\nCollapsible A by _Oceanic_ , the bodies were buried at sea.[222]\n\nThe last _Titanic_ body recovered was steward James McGrady, Body No. 330,\nfound by the chartered Newfoundland sealing vessel _Algerine_ on 22 May and\nburied at [Fairview Lawn\nCemetery](/wiki/Fairview_Cemetery,_Halifax,_Nova_Scotia \"Fairview Cemetery,\nHalifax, Nova Scotia\") in Halifax on 12 June.[223]\n\nOnly 333 bodies of _Titanic_ victims were recovered, one in five of the over\n1500 victims. Some bodies sank with the ship while currents quickly dispersed\nbodies and wreckage across hundreds of miles making them difficult to recover.\nBy June one of the last search ships reported that life jackets supporting\nbodies were coming apart and releasing bodies to sink.[224]\n\n## Wreck\n\nMain article: [Wreck of the RMS Titanic](/wiki/Wreck_of_the_RMS_Titanic \"Wreck\nof the RMS Titanic\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Titanic_wreck_bow.jpg/250px-\nTitanic_wreck_bow.jpg)](/wiki/File:Titanic_wreck_bow.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Titanic_wreck_bow.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe bow of the wrecked RMS _Titanic_ , photographed in June 2004\n\n_Titanic_ was long thought to have sunk in one piece and, over the years, many\nschemes were put forward for raising the wreck. None came to fruition.[225]\nThe fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding and reaching a\nwreck that lies over 12,000 feet (3,700 m) below the surface, in a location\nwhere the water pressure is over 6,500 pounds per square inch (450 bar).[226]\nA number of expeditions were mounted to find _Titanic_ but it was not until 1\nSeptember 1985 that a Franco-American expedition led by [Robert\nBallard](/wiki/Robert_Ballard \"Robert Ballard\") succeeded.[227][228]\n\nThe team discovered that _Titanic_ had in fact split apart, probably near or\nat the surface, before sinking to the seabed. The separated bow and stern\nsections lie about a third of a mile (0.6 km) apart in [Titanic\nCanyon](/wiki/Titanic_Canyon \"Titanic Canyon\") off the coast of Newfoundland.\nThey are located 13.2 miles (21.2 km) from the inaccurate coordinates given by\n_Titanic_ 's radio operators on the night of her sinking,[229] and\napproximately 715 miles (1,151 km) from Halifax and 1,250 miles (2,012 km)\nfrom New York.\n\nBoth sections struck the sea bed at considerable speed, causing the bow to\ncrumple and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow is by far the more intact\nsection and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast,\nthe stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down on top of each\nother and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the\nsea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to\nstructural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of\nthe stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.[230]\n\nThe two sections are surrounded by a debris field measuring approximately 5 by\n3 miles (8.0 km × 4.8 km).[231] It contains hundreds of thousands of items,\nsuch as pieces of the ship, furniture, dinnerware and personal items, which\nfell from the ship as she sank or were ejected when the bow and stern impacted\non the sea floor.[232] The debris field was also the last resting place of a\nnumber of _Titanic_ 's victims. Most of the bodies and clothes were consumed\nby sea creatures and bacteria, leaving pairs of shoes and boots—which have\nproved to be inedible—as the only sign that bodies once lay there.[233]\n\nSince its initial discovery, the wreck of _Titanic_ has been revisited on\nnumerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and\nsalvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for\nconservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated\nsignificantly over the years, particularly from accidental damage by\nsubmersibles but mostly because of an accelerating rate of growth of iron-\neating bacteria on the hull.[234] It has been estimated that within the next\n50 years the hull and structure of _Titanic_ will eventually collapse\nentirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship\nintermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor.[235]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Titanic_bell.JPG/200px-\nTitanic_bell.JPG)](/wiki/File:Titanic_bell.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Titanic_bell.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nBell from the _[Titanic](/wiki/Titanic \"Titanic\")_\n\nMany artefacts from _Titanic_ have been recovered from the sea bed by RMS\nTitanic Inc., which exhibits them in touring exhibitions around the world and\nin a permanent exhibition at the [Luxor Las Vegas](/wiki/Luxor_Las_Vegas\n\"Luxor Las Vegas\") hotel and casino in [Las Vegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley \"Las\nVegas Valley\"), [Nevada](/wiki/Nevada \"Nevada\").[236] A number of other\nmuseums exhibit artefacts either donated by survivors or retrieved from the\nfloating bodies of victims of the disaster.[237]\n\nOn 16 April 2012, the day after the 100th anniversary of the sinking, photos\nwere released showing possible human remains resting on the ocean floor. The\nphotos, taken by [Robert Ballard](/wiki/Robert_Ballard \"Robert Ballard\")\nduring an expedition led by\n[NOAA](/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration \"National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Administration\") in 2004, show a boot and a coat close to\n_Titanic '_s stern which experts called \"compelling evidence\" that it is the\nspot where somebody came to rest, and that human remains could be buried in\nthe sediment beneath them.[238] The wreck of the _Titanic_ falls under the\nscope of the 2001 [UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater\nCultural\nHeritage](/wiki/UNESCO_Convention_on_the_Protection_of_the_Underwater_Cultural_Heritage\n\"UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage\").\nThis means that all states party to the convention will prohibit the\npillaging, commercial exploitation, sale and dispersion of the wreck and its\nartefacts. Because of the location of the wreck in [international\nwaters](/wiki/International_waters \"International waters\") and the lack of any\nexclusive jurisdiction over the wreckage area, the convention provides a state\nco-operation system, by which states inform each other of any potential\nactivity concerning ancient shipwreck sites, like the _Titanic_ , and co-\noperate to prevent unscientific or unethical interventions.[239][240][241]\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Safety\n\nMain article: [Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the RMS\nTitanic](/wiki/Changes_in_safety_practices_after_the_sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic\n\"Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the RMS Titanic\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/USCG_International_Ice_Patrol_C-130.jpg/250px-\nUSCG_International_Ice_Patrol_C-130.jpg)](/wiki/File:USCG_International_Ice_Patrol_C-130.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:USCG_International_Ice_Patrol_C-130.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn ice patrol aircraft inspecting an iceberg\n\nAfter the disaster, recommendations were made by both the British and American\nBoards of Inquiry stating that ships should carry enough lifeboats for all\naboard, mandated lifeboat drills would be implemented, lifeboat inspections\nwould be conducted, etc. Many of these recommendations were incorporated into\nthe [International Convention for the Safety of Life at\nSea](/wiki/International_Convention_for_the_Safety_of_Life_at_Sea\n\"International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea\") passed in 1914.[242]\nThe convention has been updated by periodic amendments, with a completely new\nversion adopted in 1974.[243] Signatories to the convention followed up with\nnational legislation to implement the new standards. For example in Britain,\nnew \"Rules for Life Saving Appliances\" were passed by the [Board of\nTrade](/wiki/Board_of_Trade \"Board of Trade\") on 8 May 1914 and then applied\nat a meeting of British steamship companies in Liverpool in June 1914.[244]\n\nFurther, the United States government passed the [Radio Act of\n1912](/wiki/Radio_Act_of_1912 \"Radio Act of 1912\"). This act, along with the\nInternational Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio\ncommunications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours a day, along with\na secondary power supply, so as not to miss distress calls. Also, the Radio\nAct of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity\nas well as coastal onshore radio stations.[245] In addition, it was agreed in\nthe International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of\nred rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of need for help. Once\nthe Radio Act of 1912 was passed it was agreed that rockets at sea would be\ninterpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible\nmisinterpretation from other ships.[245]\n\nFinally, the disaster led to the formation and international funding of the\n[International Ice Patrol](/wiki/International_Ice_Patrol \"International Ice\nPatrol\"), an agency of the United States Coast Guard that to the present day\nmonitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that\ncould pose a threat to transatlantic sea traffic. Coast Guard aircraft conduct\nthe primary reconnaissance. In addition, information is collected from ships\noperating in or passing through the ice area. Except for the years of the two\nWorld Wars, the International Ice Patrol has worked each season since 1913.\nDuring the period there has not been a single reported loss of life or\nproperty due to collision with an iceberg in the patrol area.[246] In 1912,\nthe [Board of Trade](/wiki/Board_of_Trade \"Board of Trade\")\n[chartered](/wiki/Bareboat_charter \"Bareboat charter\") the\n[barque](/wiki/Barque \"Barque\") [_Scotia_](/wiki/Scotia_\\(barque\\) \"Scotia\n\\(barque\\)\") to act as a [weather ship](/wiki/Weather_ship \"Weather ship\") in\nthe [Grand Banks of Newfoundland](/wiki/Grand_Banks_of_Newfoundland \"Grand\nBanks of Newfoundland\"), keeping a look-out for icebergs.

Just after the sinking memorial postcards\nsold in huge numbers[249] together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy\nboxes to plates, whiskey jiggers,[250] and even black mourning teddy\nbears.[251] Several survivors wrote books about their experiences[252] but it\nwas not until 1955 the first historically accurate book _[A Night to\nRemember](/wiki/A_Night_to_Remember_\\(book\\) \"A Night to Remember \\(book\\)\")_\nwas published.[253]\n\nThe first film about the disaster, _[Saved from the\nTitanic](/wiki/Saved_from_the_Titanic \"Saved from the Titanic\")_ , was\nreleased only 29 days after the ship sank and had an actual survivor as its\nstar—the silent film actress [Dorothy Gibson](/wiki/Dorothy_Gibson \"Dorothy\nGibson\").[254] The British film [_A Night to Remember_\n(1958)](/wiki/A_Night_to_Remember_\\(1958_film\\) \"A Night to Remember \\(1958\nfilm\\)\") is still widely regarded as the most historically accurate movie\nportrayal of the sinking.[255] The most financially successful by far has been\n[James Cameron](/wiki/James_Cameron \"James Cameron\")'s\n_[Titanic](/wiki/Titanic_\\(1997_film\\) \"Titanic \\(1997 film\\)\")_ (1997), which\nbecame the highest-grossing film in history up to that time,[256] as well as\nthe winner of 11 [Oscars](/wiki/Academy_Awards \"Academy Awards\") at the [70th\nAcademy Awards](/wiki/70th_Academy_Awards \"70th Academy Awards\"), including\n[Best Picture](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture \"Academy Award for Best\nPicture\") and [Best Director](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director \"Academy\nAward for Best Director\") for Cameron.[257]\n\nThe _Titanic_ disaster was commemorated through a variety of memorials and\nmonuments to the victims, erected in several English-speaking countries and in\nparticular in cities that had suffered notable losses. These included\nSouthampton, Liverpool and Belfast in the United Kingdom; New York and\nWashington, D.C. in the United States; and Cobh (formerly Queenstown) in\nIreland.[258] A number of museums around the world have displays on _Titanic_.\nIn [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\"), the ship is\ncommemorated by the [Titanic Belfast](/wiki/Titanic_Belfast \"Titanic Belfast\")\nvisitor attraction, opened on 31 March 2012, that stands on the site of the\nshipyard where _Titanic_ was built.[259]\n\nRMS Titanic Inc., which is authorised to salvage the wreck site, has a\npermanent _Titanic_ exhibition at the [Luxor Las Vegas](/wiki/Luxor_Las_Vegas\n\"Luxor Las Vegas\") hotel and casino in [Nevada](/wiki/Nevada \"Nevada\") which\nfeatures a 22-ton slab of the ship's hull.

Sir Alfred Chalmers, nautical adviser to the Board of Trade from 1896 to 1911, had considered the matter of adjusting the scale \"from time to time\", but because he not only assumed that experienced sailors would need to be carried \"uselessly\" aboard ship only to lower and man the extra lifeboats, but also anticipated the difficulty in getting away a greater number than 16 boats in any emergency, he \"did not consider it necessary to increase [the scale]\".[67]\n  7. **Jump up ^** He expressed deep disappointment about the decision before the voyage, but was presumably greatly relieved afterwards.[102]\n  8. **Jump up ^** _Titanic_ also had a ship's cat, Jenny, who gave birth to a litter of kittens shortly before the ship's maiden voyage; all perished in the sinking.[106]\n  9. **Jump up ^** Known afterward as the \"Unsinkable Molly Brown\" due to her efforts in helping other passengers while the ship sank\n  10. **Jump up ^** Captain Edward Smith had been in command of _Titanic_ 's sister _Olympic_ when she in 1911 collided with a warship. Even though that ship was designed to sink others by ramming them, it suffered greater damage than _Olympic_ , thereby strengthening the image of the class being unsinkable.[141][142]\n  11. **Jump up ^** The official enquiry found that damage extended about 300 feet, but both Edward Wilding's testimony and modern [ultrasound](/wiki/Ultrasound \"Ultrasound\") surveys of the [wreck](/wiki/Wreck_of_the_RMS_Titanic \"Wreck of the RMS Titanic\") suggest the total area was perhaps a few narrow openings totalling perhaps no more than 12 to 13 square feet (1.1 to 1.2 m2).[145][75]\n  12. **Jump up ^** An incident confirmed this philosophy while _Titanic_ was under construction: the White Star liner _Republic_ was involved in a collision and sank. Even though she did not have enough lifeboats for all passengers, they were all saved because the ship was able to stay afloat long enough for them to be ferried to ships coming to assist.[148]\n  13. **Jump up ^** Life expectancy in such temperatures is often under 15 minutes even for people who are young and fit. The victims would have died from [bodily reactions](/wiki/Involuntary_action \"Involuntary action\") to freezing water rather than [hypothermia](/wiki/Hypothermia \"Hypothermia\") (loss of core temperature). Immersed into freezing seas, around 20% of victims die within two minutes from [cold shock](/wiki/Cold_shock_response \"Cold shock response\") (uncontrolled [rapid breathing](/wiki/Hyperventilation \"Hyperventilation\") and gasping causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure, cardiac strain leading to cardiac arrest, and [panic](/wiki/Panic \"Panic\")), another 50% die within 15–30 minutes from [cold incapacitation](/wiki/Cold_incapacitation \"Cold incapacitation\") (inability to use or control limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body 'protectively' shuts down peripheral muscles to protect its core),[155] and exhaustion and unconsciousness cause [drowning](/wiki/Drowning \"Drowning\"), claiming the rest within a similar time.[156]\n  14. **Jump up ^** The Salvation Army newspaper, _The War Cry_ , reported that \"none but a heart of stone would be unmoved in the presence of such anguish. Night and day that crowd of pale, anxious faces had been waiting patiently for the news that did not come. Nearly every one in the crowd had lost a relative.\"[172] It was not until 17 April that the first incomplete lists of survivors came through, delayed by poor communications.[173]\n  15. **Jump up ^** On 23 April, the _Daily Mail_ reported: \"Late in the afternoon hope died out. The waiting crowds thinned, and silent men and women sought their homes. In the humbler homes of Southampton there is scarcely a family who has not lost a relative or friend. Children returning from school appreciated something of tragedy, and woeful little faces were turned to the darkened, fatherless homes.\"[180]\n  16. **Jump up ^** According to an eyewitness report, there \"were many pathetic scenes\" when _Titanic_ 's survivors disembarked at New York[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n  17. **Jump up ^** Lord protested his innocence to the end of his life, and many researchers have asserted that the known positions of _Titanic_ and _Californian_ make it impossible that the former was the infamous \"mystery ship\", a topic which has \"generated ... millions of words and ... hours of heated debates\" and continues to do so.[207]\n  18. **Jump up ^** Most of the bodies were numbered, however, the five passengers [buried at sea](/wiki/Burial_at_sea \"Burial at sea\") by _Carpathia_ went unnumbered.[218]\n  19. **Jump up ^** Thomas Beattie, a first class passenger, and two crew members, a fireman and a seaman.\n  20. **Jump up ^** An example is Daniel Butler's book about RMS _Titanic_ , titled _Unsinkable_\n  21. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ Ship's time; at the time of the collision, _Titanic_ 's clocks were set to 2 hours 2 minutes ahead of [Eastern Time Zone](/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone \"Eastern Time Zone\") and 2 hours 58 minutes behind [Greenwich Mean Time](/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time \"Greenwich Mean Time\").[273]\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Beveridge & Hall 2004, p. 1.\n  2. **Jump up ^** [_Official investigation report - the sinking of RMS Titanic_](http://www.sshsa.org/media/splash/TheFinalBoardofInquiry.pdf) (PDF) (1 ed.).
