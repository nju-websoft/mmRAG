The\n[labyrinth fish](/wiki/Anabantoidei \"Anabantoidei\") have developed a special\norgan that allows them to take advantage of the oxygen of the air, but is not\na true lung. Fish use the process known as countercurrent flow, in which water\nand blood flow in opposite directions across the gills, maximizing the\ndiffusion of oxygen.\n\n###\nMolluscs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aquatic_respiration&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Molluscs\")]\n\nSee also: [Respiratory system of\ngastropods](/wiki/Respiratory_system_of_gastropods \"Respiratory system of\ngastropods\")\n\n[Molluscs](/wiki/Molluscs \"Molluscs\") generally possess gills that allow\nexchange of oxygen from an aqueous environment into the circulatory system.\nThese animals also possess a heart that pumps blood which contains\nhemocyaninine as its oxygen-capturing molecule. Therefore, this respiratory\nsystem is similar to that of vertebrate fish. The [respiratory system of\ngastropods](/wiki/Respiratory_system_of_gastropods \"Respiratory system of\ngastropods\") can include either gills or a lung.\n\n###\nArthropods[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aquatic_respiration&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Arthropods\")]\n\nSee also: [Gill ยง Invertebrate gills](/wiki/Gill#Invertebrate_gills \"Gill\")\n\nAquatic [arthropods](/wiki/Arthropod \"Arthropod\") generally possess some form\nof gills in which gas exchange takes place by diffusing through the\n[exoskeleton](/wiki/Exoskeleton \"Exoskeleton\"). Others may breathe atmospheric\nair while remaining submerged, via breathing tubes or trapped air bubbles,\nthough some [aquatic insects](/wiki/Aquatic_insect \"Aquatic insect\") may\nremain submerged indefinitely and respire using a\n[plastron](/wiki/Plastron_\\(arthropod\\) \"Plastron \\(arthropod\\)\"). A very few\n[Arachnids](/wiki/Arachnid \"Arachnid\") have adopted an aquatic life style\nincluding the [Diving bell spider](/wiki/Diving_bell_spider \"Diving bell\nspider\"). In all cases, oxygen is provided from air trapped by hairs around\nthe animals body.\n\n### Aquatic\nreptiles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aquatic_respiration&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Aquatic reptiles\")]\n\nAll aquatic reptiles breathe air into lungs. The [anatomical\nstructure](/wiki/Anatomy \"Anatomy\") of the [lungs](/wiki/Lungs \"Lungs\") is\nless complex in [reptiles](/wiki/Reptiles \"Reptiles\") than in\n[mammals](/wiki/Mammals \"Mammals\"), with reptiles lacking the very extensive\nairway tree structure found in mammalian lungs. [Gas\nexchange](/wiki/Gas_exchange \"Gas exchange\") in reptiles still occurs in\n[alveoli](/wiki/Alveoli \"Alveoli\") however, reptiles do not possess a\n[diaphragm](/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm \"Thoracic diaphragm\"). Thus, breathing\noccurs via a change in the volume of the body cavity which is controlled by\ncontraction of [intercostal muscles](/wiki/Intercostal_muscle \"Intercostal\nmuscle\") in all reptiles except [turtles](/wiki/Turtle \"Turtle\"). In turtles,\ncontraction of specific pairs of flank muscles governs\n[inspiration](/wiki/Inhalation \"Inhalation\") or [expiration](/wiki/Exhalation\n\"Exhalation\").[1]\n\nSee also [reptiles](/wiki/Reptiles#Respiration \"Reptiles\") for more detailed\ndescriptions of the respiratory system in these animals.\n\n###\nAmphibians[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aquatic_respiration&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Amphibians\")]\n\nSee also: [Amphibian ยง Respiratory system](/wiki/Amphibian#Respiratory_system\n\"Amphibian\")\n\nBoth the lungs and the [skin](/wiki/Frog#Morphology_and_physiology \"Frog\")\nserve as respiratory organs in [amphibians](/wiki/Amphibians \"Amphibians\").\nThe skin of these animals is highly vascularized and moist, with moisture\nmaintained via secretion of [mucus](/wiki/Mucus \"Mucus\") from specialized\ncells. While the lungs are of primary importance to breathing control, the\nskin's unique properties aid rapid gas exchange when amphibians are submerged\nin oxygen-rich water.[2]\n\n### Aquatic\nbirds[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aquatic_respiration&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Aquatic birds\")]\n\nThe respiratory system of birds differs significantly from that found in\nmammals, containing unique anatomical features such as [air\nsacs](/wiki/Air_sacs \"Air sacs\"). The lungs of birds also do not have the\ncapacity to inflate as birds lack a [diaphragm](/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm\n\"Thoracic diaphragm\") and a [pleural cavity](/wiki/Pleural_cavity \"Pleural\ncavity\"). Gas exchange in birds occurs between air capillaries and [blood\ncapillaries](/wiki/Capillary \"Capillary\"), rather than in\n[alveoli](/wiki/Alveoli \"Alveoli\"). See [Avian respiratory\nsystem](/wiki/Bird_anatomy#Respiratory_system \"Bird anatomy\") for a detailed\ndescription of these and other features.\n\n## Gills[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aquatic_respiration&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Gills\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Tuna_Gills_in_Situ_01.jpg/220px-\nTuna_Gills_in_Situ_01.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tuna_Gills_in_Situ_01.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tuna_Gills_in_Situ_01.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPosterior view of the gills of a [tuna](/wiki/Tuna \"Tuna\")\n\nLarge aquatic animals have developed [gills](/wiki/Gill \"Gill\") for\n[respiration](/wiki/Respiration_\\(physiology\\) \"Respiration \\(physiology\\)\")\nwhich are specifically adapted to their function, for example, they have:\n\n  * A large [surface area](/wiki/Surface_area \"Surface area\") to allow as much [oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\") to enter the gills as possible because more of the gas comes into contact with the [membrane](/wiki/Biological_membrane \"Biological membrane\")\n  * Good [blood supply](/wiki/Blood_circulation \"Blood circulation\") to maintain the concentration gradient needed\n  * Thin membrane to allow for a short diffusion pathway\n  * each gill arch has two rows (hemibranchs) of [gill filaments](/wiki/Gill_filament \"Gill filament\")\n  * each gill filament has many [lamellae](/wiki/Lamella_\\(zoology\\) \"Lamella \\(zoology\\)\")\n\nIn [osteichthyes](/wiki/Osteichthyes \"Osteichthyes\"), the gills contain 4\n[gill arches](/wiki/Gill_arch \"Gill arch\") on each side of the head, two on\neach side for [chondrichthyes](/wiki/Chondrichthyes \"Chondrichthyes\") or 7\ngill baskets on each side of the fish's head in [Lampreys](/wiki/Lampreys\n\"Lampreys\"). In fish, the long bony cover for the gill (the\n[operculum](/wiki/Operculum_\\(fish\\) \"Operculum \\(fish\\)\")) can be used for\npushing water. Some fish pump water using the operculum. Without an operculum,\nother methods, such as ram [ventilation](/wiki/Ventilation_\\(physiology\\)\n\"Ventilation \\(physiology\\)\"), are required. Some species of\n[sharks](/wiki/Shark \"Shark\") use this system. When they swim, water flows\ninto the mouth and across the gills. Because these sharks rely on this\ntechnique, they must keep swimming in order to respire.\n\nBony fish use [countercurrent flow](/wiki/Countercurrent_exchange\n\"Countercurrent exchange\") to maximize the intake of oxygen that can\n[diffuse](/wiki/Diffusion \"Diffusion\") through the gill. Countercurrent flow\noccurs when deoxygenated blood moves through the gill in one direction while\noxygenated water moves through the gill in the opposite direction. This\nmechanism maintains the [concentration gradient](/wiki/Concentration_gradient\n\"Concentration gradient\") thus increasing the efficiency of the respiration\nprocess as well and prevents the oxygen levels from reaching an\n[equilibrium](/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium \"Chemical equilibrium\").\nCartilaginous fish do not have a countercurrent flow system as they lack bones\nwhich are needed to have the opened out gill that bony fish have.\n\n## Control of\nrespiration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aquatic_respiration&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Control of respiration\")]\n\nScientists have investigated what part of the body is responsible for\nmaintaining the respiratory rhythm. They found that [neurons](/wiki/Neuron\n\"Neuron\") located in the [brainstem](/wiki/Brainstem \"Brainstem\") of fish are\nresponsible for the genesis of the respiratory rhythm.[3] The position of\nthese neurons is slightly different from the centers of respiratory genesis in\nmammals but they are located in the same brain compartment, which has caused\ndebates about the [homology](/wiki/Homology_\\(biology\\) \"Homology\n\\(biology\\)\") of respiratory centers between aquatic and terrestrial species.\nIn both aquatic and terrestrial respiration, the exact mechanisms by which\nneurons can generate this involuntary rhythm are still not completely\nunderstood (see [Involuntary control of\nrespiration](/wiki/Involuntary_control_of_respiration \"Involuntary control of\nrespiration\")).\n\nAnother important feature of the respiratory rhythm is that it is modulated to\nadapt to the oxygen consumption of the body. As observed in mammals, fish\nโbreatheโ faster and heavier when they do [physical exercise](/wiki/Exercise\n\"Exercise\"). The mechanisms by which these changes occur have been strongly\ndebated over more than 100 years between scientists.[4] The authors can be\nclassified in 2 schools:\n\n1\\. Those who think that the major part of the respiratory changes are pre-\nprogrammed in the brain, which would imply that neurons from\n[locomotion](/wiki/Animal_locomotion \"Animal locomotion\") centers of the brain\nconnect to [respiratory centers](/wiki/Respiratory_center \"Respiratory\ncenter\") in anticipation of movements.\n\n2\\. Those who think that the major part of the respiratory changes result from\nthe detection of muscle contraction, and that respiration is adapted as a\nconsequence of muscular contraction and oxygen consumption. This would imply\nthat the brain possesses some kind of detection mechanisms that would trigger\na respiratory response when muscular contraction occurs.\n\nMany now agree that both mechanisms are probably present and complementary, or\nworking alongside a mechanism that can detect changes in oxygen and/or carbon\ndioxide blood saturation.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aquatic_respiration&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Anaerobic respiration](/wiki/Anaerobic_respiration \"Anaerobic respiration\")\n  * [Cellular respiration](/wiki/Cellular_respiration \"Cellular respiration\")\n  * [Control of respiration](/wiki/Control_of_respiration \"Control of respiration\")\n  * [Ecosystem respiration](/wiki/Ecosystem_respiration \"Ecosystem respiration\")\n  * [Maintenance respiration](/wiki/Maintenance_respiration \"Maintenance respiration\")\n  * [Respiration (physiology)](/wiki/Respiration_\\(physiology\\) \"Respiration \\(physiology\\)\")\n  * [Respiratory system](/wiki/Respiratory_system \"Respiratory system\")\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aquatic_respiration&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"reptile - animal\"](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498684/reptile/38473/Respiratory-system).
