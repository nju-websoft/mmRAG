It is\nfound in Jewish, Christian, and in Sunni Muslim worship as a concluding word\nor response to [prayers](/wiki/Prayer \"Prayer\").[2] Common English\ntranslations of the word _amen_ include \"verily\" and \"truly\". It can also be\nused colloquially to express strong agreement,[2] as in, for instance, _amen\nto that_.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Pronunciation\n  * 2 Etymology\n    * 2.1 Hebrew Bible\n    * 2.2 New Testament\n  * 3 Religious use\n    * 3.1 Judaism\n    * 3.2 Christianity\n    * 3.3 Islam\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 Notes\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 Further reading\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Pronunciation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Pronunciation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

The _ay-men_ pronunciation, a product of the\n[Great Vowel Shift](/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift \"Great Vowel Shift\") dating to the\n15th century, is associated with Irish Protestantism and conservative\n[Evangelical](/wiki/Evangelical_Christianity \"Evangelical Christianity\")\ndenominations generally, and is the pronunciation typically used in [gospel\nmusic](/wiki/Gospel_music \"Gospel music\").\n\nIn [Arabic](/wiki/Arabic \"Arabic\") the pronunciation _ah-meen_ (ʾĀmīn) is used\nupon completing a [supplication to God](/wiki/Dua \"Dua\") or when concluding\nrecitation of the first surah [Al Fatiha](/wiki/Al_Fatiha \"Al Fatiha\") in\n[prayer](/wiki/Salat \"Salat\").\n\n## Etymology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Etymology\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Amen_in_East_Syriac_Aramaic_language.svg/150px-\nAmen_in_East_Syriac_Aramaic_language.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Amen_in_East_Syriac_Aramaic_language.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Amen_in_East_Syriac_Aramaic_language.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Amen\" in contemporary (_Madnhāyā_) [Syriac script](/wiki/Syriac_script\n\"Syriac script\").\n\nThe usage of _Amen_ , meaning \"so be it\", as found in the early scriptures of\nthe [Bible](/wiki/Bible \"Bible\") is said to be of\n[Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\") origin;[5] however, the\nbasic [triconsonantal root](/wiki/Triconsonantal_root \"Triconsonantal root\")\nfrom which the word was derived is common to a number of languages, such as\n[Aramaic](/wiki/Aramaic_language \"Aramaic language\"), in the [Semitic\nbranch](/wiki/Semitic_languages \"Semitic languages\") of the [Afrasian\nlanguages](/wiki/Afrasian_languages \"Afrasian languages\"). The word was\nimported into the Greek of the early Church from Judaism.[1][6] From Greek,\n_amen_ entered the other Western languages. According to a standard dictionary\netymology, _amen_ passed from Greek into [Late Latin](/wiki/Late_Latin \"Late\nLatin\"), and thence into English.[7] Rabbinic scholars from medieval France\nbelieved the standard Hebrew word for faith _emuna_ comes from the root\n_amen._ Although in English transliteration they look different, they are both\nfrom the root [aleph](/wiki/Aleph \"Aleph\")-mem-nun. That is, the Hebrew word\n_amen_ derives from the same ancient [triliteral](/wiki/Triliteral\n\"Triliteral\") Hebrew root as does the verb _ʾāmán_.[8]\n\nGrammarians frequently list _ʾāmán_ under its three consonants\n(**[aleph](/wiki/Aleph \"Aleph\")-[mem](/wiki/Mem\n\"Mem\")-[nun](/wiki/Nun_\\(letter\\) \"Nun \\(letter\\)\")**), which are identical to\nthose of _ʾāmēn_ (note that the Hebrew letter א _aleph_ represents a [glottal\nstop](/wiki/Glottal_stop \"Glottal stop\") sound, which functions as a consonant\nin the morphology of Hebrew).[7] This [triliteral](/wiki/Triliteral\n\"Triliteral\") root means _to be firm, confirmed, reliable, faithful, have\nfaith, believe._\n\nIn [Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language \"Arabic language\"), the word is derived from\nits [triliteral](/wiki/Triliteral \"Triliteral\") common root word ʾĀmana\n([Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language \"Arabic language\"): آمن‎), which has the same\nmeanings as the Hebrew root word.\n\nPopular among some [theosophists](/wiki/Theosophy \"Theosophy\"),[9] proponents\nof [Afrocentric](/wiki/Afrocentric \"Afrocentric\") theories of history,[10] and\nadherents of [esoteric Christianity](/wiki/Esoteric_Christianity \"Esoteric\nChristianity\")[11][12] is the [conjecture](/wiki/Conjecture \"Conjecture\") that\n_amen_ is a derivative of the name of the [Egyptian god](/wiki/Egyptian_god\n\"Egyptian god\") [Amun](/wiki/Amun \"Amun\") (which is sometimes also spelled\n**Amen**). Some adherents of Eastern religions believe that _amen_ shares\nroots with the Hindu [Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit \"Sanskrit\") word,\n_[Aum](/wiki/Om \"Om\")_.[13][14][15][16] Such external etymologies are not\nincluded in standard etymological reference works. The Hebrew word, as noted\nabove, starts with aleph, while the Egyptian name begins with a\n[yodh](/wiki/Yodh \"Yodh\").[17]\n\nThe [Armenian](/wiki/Armenian_language \"Armenian language\") word\n[ամեն](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D5%A1%D5%B4%D5%A5%D5%B6#Armenian\n\"wikt:ամեն\") (_amen_) means \"every\"; however it is also used in the same form\nat the conclusion of prayers, much as in English.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\nFrench, the Hebrew word _amen_ is sometimes translated as _Ainsi soit-il_ ,\nwhich means \"So be it.\"[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Hebrew Bible[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Hebrew Bible\")]\n\nThe word first occurs in the [Hebrew Bible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible \"Hebrew Bible\")\nin Numbers 5:22 when the Priest addresses a suspected adulteress and she\nresponds “Amen, Amen”. Overall, the word appears in the Hebrew Bible 30 times.\n\nThree distinct Biblical usages of _amen_ may be noted:[1]\n\n  1. Initial _amen_ , referring back to words of another speaker and introducing an affirmative sentence, e.g. 1 [Kings](/wiki/Books_of_Kings \"Books of Kings\") 1:36.[1]\n  2. Detached _amen_ , again referring to the words of another speaker but without a complementary affirmative sentence, e.g. Nehemiah 5:13.[1]\n  3. Final _amen_ , with no change of speaker, as in the subscription to the first three divisions of [Psalms](/wiki/Psalms \"Psalms\").[1]\n\n### New Testament[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: New Testament\")]\n\nThere are 52 amens in the [Synoptic Gospels](/wiki/Synoptic_Gospels \"Synoptic\nGospels\") and 25 in [John](/wiki/Gospel_of_John \"Gospel of John\"). The five\nfinal amens (Matthew 6:13, 28:20, Mark 16:20, Luke 24:53 and John 21:25),\nwhich are wanting in certain [manuscripts](/wiki/Biblical_manuscripts\n\"Biblical manuscripts\"), simulate the effect of final amen in the Hebrew\n[Psalms](/wiki/Psalms \"Psalms\"). All initial amens occur in the sayings of\nJesus. These initial amens are unparalleled in Hebrew literature, according to\n[Friedrich Delitzsch](/wiki/Friedrich_Delitzsch \"Friedrich Delitzsch\"),\nbecause they do not refer to the words of a previous speaker but instead\nintroduce a new thought.[18]\n\nThe uses of _amen_ (\"verily\" or \"I tell you the truth\", depending on the\ntranslation) in the [Gospels](/wiki/Gospels \"Gospels\") form a peculiar class;\nthey are initial, but often lack any backward reference.[19]\n[Jesus](/wiki/Jesus \"Jesus\") used the word to affirm his own utterances, not\nthose of another person[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_], and this usage was adopted by the church. The\nuse of the initial amen, single or double in form, to introduce solemn\nstatements of Jesus in the Gospels had no parallel in Jewish practice.[20]\n\nIn the [King James Bible](/wiki/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible \"King James\nVersion of the Bible\"), the word _amen_ is preserved in a number of contexts.\nNotable ones include:\n\n  * The [catechism](/wiki/Catechism \"Catechism\") of curses of the [Law](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") found in [Deuteronomy](/wiki/Deuteronomy \"Deuteronomy\") 27.[1]\n  * A double _amen_ (\"amen and amen\") occurs in [Psalm](/wiki/Psalm \"Psalm\") 89 (Psalm 41:13; 72:19; 89:52), to confirm the words and invoke the fulfillment of them.[21]\n  * _Amen_ occurs in several [doxology](/wiki/Doxology \"Doxology\") formulas in [Romans](/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Romans \"Epistle to the Romans\") 1:25, 9:5, 11:36, 15:33, and several times in Chapter 16.[1] It also appears in doxologies in the Psalms (41:14; 72:19; 89:53; 106:48). This liturgical form from [Judaism](/wiki/Judaism \"Judaism\").[22]\n  * It concludes all of [Paul's](/wiki/Paul_of_Tarsus \"Paul of Tarsus\") general [epistles](/wiki/Epistle \"Epistle\").\n  * In [Revelation](/wiki/Book_of_Revelation \"Book of Revelation\") 3:14, Jesus is referred to as, \"the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation.\" The whole passage reads as \"And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;\".\n  * _Amen_ concludes the [New Testament](/wiki/New_Testament \"New Testament\") at Rev. 22:21.\n\n## Religious use[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Religious use\")]\n\n### Judaism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Judaism\")]\n\nSee also: [Reciting amen](/wiki/Berakhah#Reciting_amen \"Berakhah\")\n\nAlthough amen, in Judaism, is commonly stated as a response to a blessing, it\nis also often used as an affirmation of any declaration.\n\nJewish rabbinical [law](/wiki/Halakha \"Halakha\") requires an individual to say\n_amen_ in a variety of contexts.[23]\n\nWith the rise of the synagogue during the [Second Temple](/wiki/Second_Temple\n\"Second Temple\") period, _amen_ became a common response, especially to\nbenedictions. It is recited communally to affirm a [blessing](/wiki/Brachah\n\"Brachah\") made by the [prayer reader](/wiki/Hazzan \"Hazzan\"). It is also\nmandated as a response during the [kaddish](/wiki/Kaddish \"Kaddish\") doxology.\nThe congregation is sometimes prompted to answer 'amen' by the terms _ve-\n'imru_ ([Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\"): ואמרו‎) = \"and\n[now] say (pl.),\" or, _ve-nomar_ (ונאמר) = \"and let us say.\" Contemporary\nusage reflects ancient practice: As early as the 4th century BCE, Jews\nassembled in the [Temple](/wiki/Second_temple \"Second temple\") responded\n'amen' at the close of a doxology or other prayer uttered by a\n[priest](/wiki/Kohen \"Kohen\"). This Jewish [liturgical](/wiki/Liturgical\n\"Liturgical\") use of amen was adopted by the Christians.[20] But [Jewish\nlaw](/wiki/Halakha \"Halakha\") also requires individuals to answer _amen_\nwhenever they hear a [blessing](/wiki/Brachah \"Brachah\") recited, even in a\nnon-liturgical setting.\n\nThe [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\") teaches [homiletically](/wiki/Homiletics\n\"Homiletics\") that the word _amen_ is an [acronym](/wiki/Acronym \"Acronym\")\nfor **א** ל **מ** לך **נ** אמן (_ʾEl melekh neʾeman_ , \"God, trustworthy\nKing\"),[24] the phrase recited silently by an individual before reciting the\n[Shma](/wiki/Shma \"Shma\").\n\nJews usually approximate the Hebrew pronunciation of the word:\n[/ɑːˈmɛn/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\") [_ah-\nMEN_](/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key \"Help:Pronunciation respelling\nkey\") (Israeli-[Ashkenazi](/wiki/Ashkenazi_Hebrew \"Ashkenazi Hebrew\") and\n[Sephardi](/wiki/Sephardi_Hebrew_language \"Sephardi Hebrew language\")) or\n[/ɔːˈmeɪn/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\") [_aw-\nMAYN_](/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key \"Help:Pronunciation respelling\nkey\") (non-Israeli Ashkenazi).[25]\n\n### Christianity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Christianity\")]\n\nThe use of \"amen\" has been generally adopted in Christian worship as a\nconcluding word for prayers and hymns and an expression of strong\nagreement.[20] The liturgical use of the word in apostolic times is attested\nby the passage from 1 Corinthians cited above, and [Justin\nMartyr](/wiki/Justin_Martyr \"Justin Martyr\") (c. 150) describes the\ncongregation as responding \"amen\" to the benediction after the celebration of\nthe Eucharist.[1] Its introduction into the baptismal formula (in the Eastern\nOrthodox Church it is pronounced after the name of each person of the Trinity)\nwas probably later.[26]\n\nIn [Isaiah](/wiki/Isaiah \"Isaiah\") 65:16, the authorized version has \"the God\nof truth\" (\"the God of amen\" in [Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew \"Hebrew\")). Jesus often\nused amen to put emphasis to his own words (translated: \"verily\"). In John's\nGospel, it is repeated, \"Verily, verily\". Amen is also used in oaths (Numbers\n5:22; Deuteronomy 27:15–26; Nehemiah 5:13; 8:6; 1 Chronicles 16:36) and is\nfurther found at the end of the prayer of primitive churches (1 Corinthians\n14:16).[21]\n\nIn some Christian [churches](/wiki/Church_\\(building\\) \"Church \\(building\\)\"),\nthe \"amen corner\" or \"amen section\" is any subset of the congregation likely\nto call out \"Amen!\" in response to points in a preacher's\n[sermon](/wiki/Sermon \"Sermon\").[27] Metaphorically, the term can refer to any\ngroup of heartfelt traditionalists or supporters of an authority figure.\n\n_Amen_ is also used in standard, international French, but in [Cajun\nFrench](/wiki/Cajun_French \"Cajun French\") _Ainsi soit-il_ (\"so be it\") is\nused instead.\n\nAmen is used at the end of the [Lord's Prayer](/wiki/Lord%27s_Prayer \"Lord's\nPrayer\"),[28] which is also called the Our Father or the _Pater Noster_.\n\n### Islam[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section:\nIslam\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Ameen.gif)](/wiki/File:Ameen.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ameen.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nʾĀmīn in [Arabic](/wiki/Arabic \"Arabic\").\n\n_ʾĀmīn_ ([Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language \"Arabic language\"): آمين‎) is the\nArabic form of _Amen_. In Islam, it is used with the same meaning as in\nJudaism and Christianity; when concluding a prayer, especially after a\n[supplication](/wiki/Supplication \"Supplication\") ([du'a](/wiki/Du%27a\n\"Du'a\")) or reciting the first surah [Al Fatiha](/wiki/Al_Fatiha \"Al Fatiha\")\nof the [Qur'an](/wiki/Qur%27an \"Qur'an\") ([salat](/wiki/Salat \"Salat\")), and\nas an assent to the prayers of others.[29][30]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Selah](/wiki/Selah \"Selah\")\n  * [So mote it be](/wiki/So_mote_it_be \"So mote it be\")\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section:\nNotes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\"): אָמֵן‬, [Modern](/wiki/Modern_Hebrew \"Modern Hebrew\")  _amen_ , [Tiberian](/wiki/Tiberian_vocalization \"Tiberian vocalization\")  _ʾāmēn_ ; [Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\"): ἀμήν; [Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language \"Arabic language\"): آمِينَ‎, _ʾāmīna_ ; \"So be it; truly\"\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amen&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ _**h**_ _**i**_ \"Amen\".
