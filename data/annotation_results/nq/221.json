It consists of the [Pan-African\ncolours](/wiki/Pan-African_colours \"Pan-African colours\") of red, yellow, and\ngreen, in horizontal stripes, with [a black five-pointed\nstar](/wiki/Black_star_of_Africa \"Black star of Africa\") in the centre of the\ngold stripe. The Ghanaian flag was the second [African](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\")\nflag after the [flag of the Ethiopian Empire](/wiki/Flag_of_Ethiopia#Colours\n\"Flag of Ethiopia\") to feature these colours. The flag's design influenced\nthat of the [flag of Guinea-Bissau](/wiki/Flag_of_Guinea-Bissau \"Flag of\nGuinea-Bissau\") (1973). It was designed by [Theodosia\nOkoh](/wiki/Theodosia_Okoh \"Theodosia Okoh\").\n\nThe red represents the blood of those who died in the country's struggle for\nindependence from the Great Britain, the gold represents the mineral wealth of\nthe country, the green symbolises the country's rich forests and natural\nwealth, and the black star is the symbol of African emancipation.[1] The black\nstar was adopted from the flag of the [Black Star Line](/wiki/Black_Star_Line\n\"Black Star Line\"), a shipping line incorporated by [Marcus\nGarvey](/wiki/Marcus_Garvey \"Marcus Garvey\") that operated from 1919 to\n1922.[2] It is where the [Ghana national football\nteam](/wiki/Ghana_national_football_team \"Ghana national football team\") draw\ntheir nickname, the _Black Stars_ , from.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 National ensign\n  * 2 Air force ensign and civil air ensign\n  * 3 History\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## National\nensign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Ghana&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: National ensign\")]\n\nUnder terms of section 183 of Ghana's Merchant Shipping Act of 1963, the\n[civil ensign](/wiki/Civil_ensign \"Civil ensign\") is a [red\nflag](/wiki/Red_Ensign \"Red Ensign\") with the national flag in a\nblack-[fimbriated](/wiki/Fimbriation \"Fimbriation\")\n[canton](/wiki/Flag_terminology \"Flag terminology\").
