ice. The first Winter Olympics, the [1924 Winter\nOlympics](/wiki/1924_Winter_Olympics \"1924 Winter Olympics\"), were held in\n[Chamonix](/wiki/Chamonix \"Chamonix\"), France. The modern Olympic games were\ninspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece,\nfrom the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. [Baron Pierre de\nCoubertin](/wiki/Pierre_de_Coubertin \"Pierre de Coubertin\") founded the\n[International Olympic Committee](/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee\n\"International Olympic Committee\") (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern\nSummer Games in Athens, Greece in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the\nOlympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and\nauthority.\n\nThe original five Winter Olympics sports (broken into nine disciplines) were\n[bobsleigh](/wiki/Bobsleigh_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Bobsleigh at the 1924\nWinter Olympics\"), [curling](/wiki/Curling_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics\n\"Curling at the 1924 Winter Olympics\"), [ice\nhockey](/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Ice hockey at the 1924\nWinter Olympics\"), [Nordic\nskiing](/wiki/Nordic_skiing_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Nordic skiing at the\n1924 Winter Olympics\") (consisting of the disciplines [military\npatrol](/wiki/Military_patrol_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Military patrol at\nthe 1924 Winter Olympics\"),[nb 2] [cross-country skiing](/wiki/Cross-\ncountry_skiing_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Cross-country skiing at the 1924\nWinter Olympics\"), [Nordic\ncombined](/wiki/Nordic_combined_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Nordic combined\nat the 1924 Winter Olympics\"), and [ski\njumping](/wiki/Ski_jumping_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Ski jumping at the\n1924 Winter Olympics\")), and [skating](/wiki/Ice_Skating \"Ice Skating\")\n(consisting of the disciplines [figure\nskating](/wiki/Figure_skating_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Figure skating at\nthe 1924 Winter Olympics\") and [speed\nskating](/wiki/Speed_skating_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Speed skating at the\n1924 Winter Olympics\")).[nb 3] The Games were held every four years from 1924\nto 1936, interrupted in 1940 and 1944 by [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II\n\"World War II\"), and resumed in [1948](/wiki/1948_Winter_Olympics \"1948 Winter\nOlympics\"). Until [1992](/wiki/1992_Winter_Olympics \"1992 Winter Olympics\")\nthe Winter and [Summer Olympic Games](/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games \"Summer\nOlympic Games\") were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986\ndecision by the [IOC](/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee \"International\nOlympic Committee\") to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year\ncycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992\nwas in [1994](/wiki/1994_Winter_Olympics \"1994 Winter Olympics\").\n\nThe Winter Games have evolved since their inception. Sports and disciplines\nhave been added and some of them, such as [Alpine\nskiing](/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Alpine skiing at the\nWinter Olympics\"), [luge](/wiki/Luge_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Luge at the\nWinter Olympics\"), [short track speed\nskating](/wiki/Short_track_speed_skating_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Short track\nspeed skating at the Winter Olympics\"), [freestyle\nskiing](/wiki/Freestyle_skiing_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Freestyle skiing at the\nWinter Olympics\"), [skeleton](/wiki/Skeleton_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Skeleton\nat the Winter Olympics\"), and\n[snowboarding](/wiki/Snowboarding_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Snowboarding at the\nWinter Olympics\"), have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic programme. Some\nothers, including [curling](/wiki/Curling_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Curling at\nthe Winter Olympics\") and [bobsleigh](/wiki/Bobsleigh_at_the_Winter_Olympics\n\"Bobsleigh at the Winter Olympics\"), have been discontinued and later\nreintroduced; others have been permanently discontinued, such as [military\npatrol](/wiki/Military_patrol_\\(sport\\) \"Military patrol \\(sport\\)\"), though\nthe modern Winter Olympic sport of\n[biathlon](/wiki/Biathlon_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Biathlon at the Winter\nOlympics\") is descended from it.[nb 2] Still others, such as [speed\nskiing](/wiki/Speed_skiing \"Speed skiing\"), [bandy](/wiki/Bandy \"Bandy\") and\n[skijoring](/wiki/Skijoring \"Skijoring\"), were [demonstration\nsports](/wiki/Demonstration_sports \"Demonstration sports\") but never\nincorporated as Olympic sports. The rise of television as a global medium for\ncommunication enhanced the profile of the Games. It generated income via the\nsale of broadcast rights and advertising, which has become lucrative for the\nIOC. This allowed outside interests, such as television companies and\ncorporate sponsors, to exert influence. The IOC has had to address numerous\ncriticisms over the decades like internal scandals, the use of [performance-\nenhancing drugs](/wiki/Doping_at_the_Olympic_Games \"Doping at the Olympic\nGames\") by Winter Olympians, as well as a political [boycott](/wiki/Boycott\n\"Boycott\") of the Winter Olympics. Nations have used the Winter (as well as\nSummer) Games to proclaim the superiority of their political systems.\n\nThe Winter Olympics has been hosted on three continents by twelve different\ncountries. The Games have been held four times in the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics \"United States at the Olympics\")\n(in [1932](/wiki/1932_Winter_Olympics \"1932 Winter Olympics\"),\n[1960](/wiki/1960_Winter_Olympics \"1960 Winter Olympics\"),\n[1980](/wiki/1980_Winter_Olympics \"1980 Winter Olympics\") and\n[2002](/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympics \"2002 Winter Olympics\")); three times in\n[France](/wiki/France_at_the_Olympics \"France at the Olympics\") (in\n[1924](/wiki/1924_Winter_Olympics \"1924 Winter Olympics\"),\n[1968](/wiki/1968_Winter_Olympics \"1968 Winter Olympics\") and\n[1992](/wiki/1992_Winter_Olympics \"1992 Winter Olympics\")); and twice each in\n[Austria](/wiki/Austria_at_the_Olympics \"Austria at the Olympics\")\n([1964](/wiki/1964_Winter_Olympics \"1964 Winter Olympics\"),\n[1976](/wiki/1976_Winter_Olympics \"1976 Winter Olympics\")),\n[Canada](/wiki/Canada_at_the_Olympics \"Canada at the Olympics\")\n([1988](/wiki/1988_Winter_Olympics \"1988 Winter Olympics\"),\n[2010](/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics \"2010 Winter Olympics\")),\n[Japan](/wiki/Japan_at_the_Olympics \"Japan at the Olympics\")\n([1972](/wiki/1972_Winter_Olympics \"1972 Winter Olympics\"),\n[1998](/wiki/1998_Winter_Olympics \"1998 Winter Olympics\")),\n[Italy](/wiki/Italy_at_the_Olympics \"Italy at the Olympics\")\n([1956](/wiki/1956_Winter_Olympics \"1956 Winter Olympics\"),\n[2006](/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics \"2006 Winter Olympics\")),\n[Norway](/wiki/Norway_at_the_Olympics \"Norway at the Olympics\")\n([1952](/wiki/1952_Winter_Olympics \"1952 Winter Olympics\"),\n[1994](/wiki/1994_Winter_Olympics \"1994 Winter Olympics\")), and\n[Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland_at_the_Olympics \"Switzerland at the Olympics\")\n([1928](/wiki/1928_Winter_Olympics \"1928 Winter Olympics\"),\n[1948](/wiki/1948_Winter_Olympics \"1948 Winter Olympics\")). Also, the Games\nhave been held just once each in [Germany](/wiki/Germany_at_the_Olympics\n\"Germany at the Olympics\") [(1936)](/wiki/1936_Winter_Olympics \"1936 Winter\nOlympics\"), [Yugoslavia](/wiki/Yugoslavia_at_the_Olympics \"Yugoslavia at the\nOlympics\") ([1984](/wiki/1984_Winter_Olympics \"1984 Winter Olympics\")),\n[Russia](/wiki/Russia_at_the_Olympics \"Russia at the Olympics\")\n([2014](/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics \"2014 Winter Olympics\")) and [South\nKorea](/wiki/South_Korea_at_the_Olympics \"South Korea at the Olympics\")\n([2018](/wiki/2018_Winter_Olympics \"2018 Winter Olympics\")). The IOC has\nselected [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing \"Beijing\"), [China](/wiki/China \"China\"), to\nhost the [2022 Winter Olympics](/wiki/2022_Winter_Olympics \"2022 Winter\nOlympics\") and the host of the [2026 Winter\nOlympics](/wiki/2026_Winter_Olympics \"2026 Winter Olympics\") will be selected\nin September 2019. As of\n2018[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Winter_Olympic_Games&action=edit),\nno city in the [southern hemisphere](/wiki/Southern_hemisphere \"Southern\nhemisphere\") has applied to host the cold-weather-dependent Winter Olympics,\nwhich are held in February at the height of the southern hemisphere summer.\n\nTo date, twelve countries have participated in every Winter Olympic Games –\nAustria, Canada, [Finland](/wiki/Finland_at_the_Olympics \"Finland at the\nOlympics\"), France, [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain_at_the_Olympics \"Great\nBritain at the Olympics\"), [Hungary](/wiki/Hungary_at_the_Olympics \"Hungary at\nthe Olympics\"), Italy, Norway, [Poland](/wiki/Poland_at_the_Olympics \"Poland\nat the Olympics\"), [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden_at_the_Olympics \"Sweden at the\nOlympics\"), Switzerland and the United States. Six of those countries have\nearned medals at every Winter Olympic Games – Austria, Canada, Finland,\nNorway, Sweden and the United States. The only country to have earned a gold\nmedal at every Winter Olympics is the United States. Norway leads the [all-\ntime medal table](/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table#Winter_Olympics\n\"All-time Olympic Games medal table\") for the Winter Olympics both on number\nof gold and overall medals, followed by the United States and Germany.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 20th century\n      * 1.1.1 1900 to 1912\n      * 1.1.2 World War I\n      * 1.1.3 1920 to 1936\n      * 1.1.4 World War II\n      * 1.1.5 1948 to 1960\n      * 1.1.6 1964 to 1980\n      * 1.1.7 1984 to 1998\n    * 1.2 21st century\n      * 1.2.1 2002 to 2010\n      * 1.2.2 2014 to 2018\n      * 1.2.3 Future\n  * 2 Controversy\n    * 2.1 Host city legacy\n    * 2.2 Doping\n  * 3 Politics\n    * 3.1 Cold War\n    * 3.2 Boycott\n  * 4 Sports\n    * 4.1 Current sports\n    * 4.2 Demonstration events\n  * 5 Ten most successful nations\n  * 6 List of Winter Olympic Games\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## History\n\n### 20th century\n\n#### 1900 to 1912\n\n[![a man standing on ice in figure\nskates](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/1908_Olympic_Games_Ulrich_Salchow.jpg/170px-1908_Olympic_Games_Ulrich_Salchow.jpg)](/wiki/File:1908_Olympic_Games_Ulrich_Salchow.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1908_Olympic_Games_Ulrich_Salchow.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Ulrich Salchow](/wiki/Ulrich_Salchow \"Ulrich Salchow\")  \nat the 1908 Olympics.\n\nA predecessor, the [Nordic Games](/wiki/Nordic_Games \"Nordic Games\"), were\norganised by General [Viktor Gustaf Balck](/wiki/Viktor_Gustaf_Balck \"Viktor\nGustaf Balck\") in [Stockholm](/wiki/Stockholm \"Stockholm\"), Sweden in 1901 and\nwere held again in 1903 and 1905 and then every fourth year thereafter until\n1926.[5] Balck was a charter member of the\n[IOC](/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee \"International Olympic Committee\")\nand a close friend of [Olympic Games](/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\")\nfounder [Pierre de Coubertin](/wiki/Pierre_de_Coubertin \"Pierre de\nCoubertin\"). He attempted to have winter sports, specifically [figure\nskating](/wiki/Figure_skating \"Figure skating\"), added to the Olympic\nprogramme but was unsuccessful until the [1908 Summer\nOlympics](/wiki/1908_Summer_Olympics \"1908 Summer Olympics\") in\n[London](/wiki/London \"London\"), United Kingdom.[5] Four figure skating events\nwere contested, at which [Ulrich Salchow](/wiki/Ulrich_Salchow \"Ulrich\nSalchow\") (10-time world champion) and [Madge Syers](/wiki/Madge_Syers \"Madge\nSyers\") won the individual titles.[6][7]\n\nThree years later, Italian count [Eugenio Brunetta\nd'Usseaux](/wiki/Eugenio_Brunetta_d%27Usseaux \"Eugenio Brunetta d'Usseaux\")\nproposed that the IOC stage a week of winter sports included as part of the\n[1912 Summer Olympics](/wiki/1912_Summer_Olympics \"1912 Summer Olympics\") in\n[Stockholm](/wiki/Stockholm \"Stockholm\"), Sweden. The organisers opposed this\nidea because they desired to protect the integrity of the Nordic Games and\nwere concerned about a lack of facilities for winter sports.[8][9][10]\n\n#### World War I\n\nThe idea was resurrected for the [1916 Games](/wiki/1916_Summer_Olympics \"1916\nSummer Olympics\"), which were to be held in [Berlin](/wiki/Berlin \"Berlin\"),\nGermany. A winter sports week with [speed skating](/wiki/Speed_skating \"Speed\nskating\"), figure skating, [ice hockey](/wiki/Ice_hockey \"Ice hockey\") and\n[Nordic skiing](/wiki/Nordic_skiing \"Nordic skiing\") was planned, but the 1916\nOlympics was cancelled after the outbreak of [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I\n\"World War I\").[9]\n\n#### 1920 to 1936\n\nThe first Olympics after the war, the [1920 Summer\nOlympics](/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics \"1920 Summer Olympics\"), were held in\n[Antwerp, Belgium](/wiki/Antwerp,_Belgium \"Antwerp, Belgium\"), and featured\nfigure skating and an ice hockey tournament.[9] Germany, Austria, Hungary,\nBulgaria and Turkey were banned from competing in the Games. At the [IOC\nCongress](/wiki/List_of_IOC_meetings \"List of IOC meetings\") held the\nfollowing year it was decided that the host nation of the [1924 Summer\nOlympics](/wiki/1924_Summer_Olympics \"1924 Summer Olympics\"), France, would\nhost a separate \"International Winter Sports Week\" under the patronage of the\nIOC. [Chamonix](/wiki/Chamonix \"Chamonix\") was chosen to host this \"week\"\n(actually 11 days) of events. [The Games](/wiki/1924_Winter_Olympics \"1924\nWinter Olympics\") proved to be a success when more than 250 athletes from 16\nnations competed in 16 events.[11] Athletes [from\nFinland](/wiki/Finland_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Finland at the 1924 Winter\nOlympics\") [and Norway](/wiki/Norway_at_the_1924_Winter_Olympics \"Norway at\nthe 1924 Winter Olympics\") won 28 medals, more than the rest of the\nparticipating nations combined.[12] Germany remained banned until 1925, and\ninstead hosted a series of games called [Deutsche\nKampfspiele](/wiki/Deutsche_Kampfspiele \"Deutsche Kampfspiele\"), starting with\nthe winter edition of 1922 (which predated the first Winter Olympics). In 1925\nthe IOC decided to create a separate winter event and the 1924 Games in\nChamonix was retroactively designated as the first Winter Olympics.[9][11]\n\n[St. Moritz](/wiki/St._Moritz \"St. Moritz\"), Switzerland, was appointed by the\nIOC to host the [second Winter Games](/wiki/1928_Winter_Olympics \"1928 Winter\nOlympics\") in 1928.[13] Fluctuating weather conditions challenged the hosts.\nThe [opening ceremony](/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony \"Olympic Games ceremony\")\nwas held in a blizzard while warm weather conditions plagued sporting events\nthroughout the rest of the Games.[14] Because of the weather the 10,000 metre\nspeed-skating event had to be abandoned and officially cancelled.[15] The\nweather was not the only noteworthy aspect of the 1928 Games: [Sonja\nHenie](/wiki/Sonja_Henie \"Sonja Henie\") of\n[Norway](/wiki/Norway_at_the_1928_Winter_Olympics \"Norway at the 1928 Winter\nOlympics\") made history when she won the [figure\nskating](/wiki/Figure_skating_at_the_1928_Winter_Olympics \"Figure skating at\nthe 1928 Winter Olympics\") competition at the age of 15. She became the\nyoungest Olympic champion in history, a distinction she held for 70 years.[16]\n\nThe [next Winter Olympics](/wiki/1932_Winter_Olympics \"1932 Winter Olympics\")\nheld in Lake Placid, New York, was the first to be hosted outside of Europe.\nSeventeen nations and 252 athletes participated.[17] This was less than in\n1928, as the journey to [Lake Placid](/wiki/Lake_Placid,_New_York \"Lake\nPlacid, New York\"), United States, was long and expensive for most\ncompetitors, who had little money in the midst of the [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\"). The athletes competed\nin fourteen events in four sports.[17] Virtually no snow fell for two months\nbefore the Games, and there was not enough snow to hold all the events until\nmid-January.[18] Sonja Henie defended her Olympic title, and [Eddie\nEagan](/wiki/Eddie_Eagan \"Eddie Eagan\") of the United States, who had been an\nOlympic champion in boxing in 1920, won the gold medal in the [men's bobsleigh\nevent](/wiki/Bobsleigh_at_the_1932_Winter_Olympics \"Bobsleigh at the 1932\nWinter Olympics\") to become the first, and so far only, Olympian to have won\ngold medals in both the [Summer](/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games \"Summer Olympic\nGames\") and Winter Olympics.[17]\n\nThe German towns of [Garmisch and Partenkirchen](/wiki/Garmisch-Partenkirchen\n\"Garmisch-Partenkirchen\") joined to organise the [1936\nedition](/wiki/1936_Winter_Olympics \"1936 Winter Olympics\") of the Winter\nGames, held on 6–16 February.[19] This was the last time the\n[Summer](/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics \"1936 Summer Olympics\") and Winter\nOlympics were held in the same country in the same year. [Alpine\nskiing](/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_1936_Winter_Olympics \"Alpine skiing at the\n1936 Winter Olympics\") made its Olympic debut, but skiing teachers were barred\nfrom entering because they were considered to be professionals.[20] Because of\nthis decision [the Swiss](/wiki/Switzerland_at_the_1936_Winter_Olympics\n\"Switzerland at the 1936 Winter Olympics\") [and\nAustrian](/wiki/Austria_at_the_1936_Winter_Olympics \"Austria at the 1936\nWinter Olympics\") skiers refused to compete at the Games.[20]\n\n#### World War II\n\n[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") interrupted the holding of\nthe Winter Olympics. The [1940 Games](/wiki/1940_Winter_Olympics \"1940 Winter\nOlympics\") had been awarded to [Sapporo](/wiki/Sapporo \"Sapporo\"), Japan, but\nthe decision was rescinded in 1938 because of the Japanese\n[invasion](/wiki/Sino-Japanese_War_\\(1937-1945\\) \"Sino-Japanese War\n\\(1937-1945\\)\") of China. The Games were then to be held at Garmisch-\nPartenkirchen, Germany, but the 1940 Games were cancelled following the German\n[invasion of Poland](/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland \"Invasion of Poland\") in\n1939.[21] Due to the ongoing war, the [1944 Games](/wiki/1944_Winter_Olympics\n\"1944 Winter Olympics\"), originally scheduled for [Cortina\nD'Ampezzo](/wiki/Cortina_D%27Ampezzo \"Cortina D'Ampezzo\"), Italy, were\ncancelled.[22]\n\n#### 1948 to 1960\n\n[![An open air arena with crowds in the stands and people on the playing field\nsurrounding a\nrostrum](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/1956_Winter_Olympics_opening_ceremonies.jpg/170px-1956_Winter_Olympics_opening_ceremonies.jpg)](/wiki/File:1956_Winter_Olympics_opening_ceremonies.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1956_Winter_Olympics_opening_ceremonies.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe opening ceremonies of the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo\n\nSt. Moritz was selected to host the [first post-war Games in\n1948](/wiki/1948_Winter_Olympics \"1948 Winter Olympics\"). Switzerland's\nneutrality had protected the town during World War II, and most of the venues\nwere in place from the 1928 Games, which made St. Moritz a logical choice. It\nbecame the first city to host a Winter Olympics twice.[23] Twenty-eight\ncountries competed in Switzerland, but athletes from Germany and Japan were\nnot invited.[24] Controversy erupted when two hockey teams from the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States_at_the_1948_Winter_Olympics \"United States at the\n1948 Winter Olympics\") arrived, both claiming to be the legitimate U.S.\nOlympic hockey representative. The [Olympic flag](/wiki/Olympic_flag#Flag\n\"Olympic flag\") presented at the [1920 Summer\nOlympics](/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics \"1920 Summer Olympics\") in Antwerp was\nstolen, as was its replacement. There was unprecedented parity at these Games,\nduring which 10 countries won gold medals—more than any Games to that\npoint.[25]\n\nThe [Olympic Flame](/wiki/Olympic_Flame \"Olympic Flame\") for the [1952\nGames](/wiki/1952_Winter_Olympics \"1952 Winter Olympics\") in [Oslo](/wiki/Oslo\n\"Oslo\"), was lit in the fireplace by skiing pioneer [Sondre\nNordheim](/wiki/Sondre_Nordheim \"Sondre Nordheim\"), and the torch relay was\nconducted by 94 participants entirely on skis.[26][27] [Bandy](/wiki/Bandy\n\"Bandy\"), a popular sport in the Nordic countries, was featured as a\ndemonstration sport, though [only\nNorway](/wiki/Norway_at_the_1952_Winter_Olympics \"Norway at the 1952 Winter\nOlympics\"), [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden_at_the_1952_Winter_Olympics \"Sweden at the\n1952 Winter Olympics\"), [and\nFinland](/wiki/Finland_at_the_1952_Winter_Olympics \"Finland at the 1952 Winter\nOlympics\") fielded teams. Norwegian athletes won 17 medals, which outpaced all\nthe other nations.[28] They were led by [Hjalmar\nAndersen](/wiki/Hjalmar_Andersen \"Hjalmar Andersen\") who won three gold medals\nin four events in the [speed\nskating](/wiki/Speed_skating_at_the_1952_Winter_Olympics \"Speed skating at the\n1952 Winter Olympics\") competition.[29]\n\nAfter not being able to host the Games in 1944, Cortina d'Ampezzo was selected\nto organise the [1956 Winter Olympics](/wiki/1956_Winter_Olympics \"1956 Winter\nOlympics\"). At the opening ceremonies the final torch bearer, Guido Caroli,\nentered the [Olympic Stadium](/wiki/Stadio_Olympica \"Stadio Olympica\") on ice\nskates. As he skated around the stadium his skate caught on a cable and he\nfell, nearly extinguishing the flame. He was able to recover and light the\ncauldron.[30] These were the first Winter Games to be televised, and the first\nOlympics ever broadcast to an international audience, though no television\nrights were sold until the [1960 Summer Olympics](/wiki/1960_Summer_Olympics\n\"1960 Summer Olympics\") in [Rome](/wiki/Rome \"Rome\").[31] The Cortina Games\nwere used to test the feasibility of televising large sporting events.[31] The\n[Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union_at_the_1956_Winter_Olympics \"Soviet Union at\nthe 1956 Winter Olympics\") made its Olympic debut and had an immediate impact,\nwinning more medals than any other nation.[32] Soviet immediate success might\nbe explained by the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\".\nThe [USSR](/wiki/Soviet_Union_at_the_Olympics \"Soviet Union at the Olympics\")\nentered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or\nworking in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to\ntrain full-time.[33][34] [Chiharu Igaya](/wiki/Chiharu_Igaya \"Chiharu Igaya\")\nwon the first Winter Olympics medal [for\nJapan](/wiki/Japan_at_the_1956_Winter_Olympics \"Japan at the 1956 Winter\nOlympics\") and the continent of Asia when he placed second in the slalom.[35]\n\nThe IOC awarded the [1960 Olympics](/wiki/1960_Winter_Olympics \"1960 Winter\nOlympics\") to [Squaw Valley](/wiki/Squaw_Valley_Ski_Resort \"Squaw Valley Ski\nResort\"), United States. It was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so from 1956 to\n1960 the infrastructure and all of the venues were built at a cost of\nUS$80,000,000.[36][37] The opening and closing ceremonies were produced by\n[Walt Disney](/wiki/Walt_Disney \"Walt Disney\").[38] The Squaw Valley Olympics\nwas the first Winter Games to have a dedicated athletes' village,[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] the\nfirst to use a computer (courtesy of [IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\")) to tabulate\nresults, and the first to feature female speed skating events. The bobsleigh\nevents were absent for the only time due to the cost of building a bobsleigh\nrun.[38]\n\n#### 1964 to 1980\n\n[![An empty arena with the sheet of ice and the score\nboard](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Miracle_on_Ice.jpg/200px-\nMiracle_on_Ice.jpg)](/wiki/File:Miracle_on_Ice.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Miracle_on_Ice.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Herb Brooks Arena](/wiki/Herb_Brooks_Arena \"Herb Brooks Arena\")  \nin [Lake Placid](/wiki/Lake_Placid,_New_York \"Lake Placid, New York\") (c.\n2007), site of  \nthe \"[Miracle on Ice](/wiki/Miracle_on_Ice \"Miracle on Ice\")\" in\n[1980](/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1980_Winter_Olympics \"Ice hockey at the 1980\nWinter Olympics\")\n\nThe Austrian city of [Innsbruck](/wiki/Innsbruck \"Innsbruck\") was the host in\n[1964](/wiki/1964_Winter_Olympics \"1964 Winter Olympics\"). Although Innsbruck\nwas a traditional winter sports resort, warm weather caused a lack of snow\nduring the Games and the Austrian army was enlisted to transport snow and ice\nto the sports venues.[38]\n[Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union_at_the_1964_Winter_Olympics \"Soviet Union at the\n1964 Winter Olympics\") speed-skater [Lidia Skoblikova](/wiki/Lidia_Skoblikova\n\"Lidia Skoblikova\") made history by winning all four speed skating events. Her\ncareer total of six gold medals set a record for Winter Olympics athletes.[38]\n[Luge](/wiki/Luge \"Luge\") was first contested in 1964, but the sport received\nbad publicity when a competitor was killed in a pre-Olympic training\nrun.[39][40]\n\nHeld in the French town of [Grenoble](/wiki/Grenoble \"Grenoble\"), the [1968\nWinter Olympics](/wiki/1968_Winter_Olympics \"1968 Winter Olympics\") were the\nfirst Olympic Games to be broadcast in colour. There were 1,158 athletes from\n37 nations competing in 35 events.[41]\n[French](/wiki/France_at_the_1968_Winter_Olympics \"France at the 1968 Winter\nOlympics\") alpine ski racer [Jean-Claude Killy](/wiki/Jean-Claude_Killy \"Jean-\nClaude Killy\") became only the second person to win all the men's alpine\nskiing events. The organising committee sold television rights for US$2\nmillion, which was more than twice the cost of the broadcast rights for the\nInnsbruck Games.[42] Venues were spread over long distances requiring three\nathletes' villages. The organisers claimed that this was necessary to\naccommodate technological advances, however critics disputed this, alleging\nthat the layout would incorporate the best possible venues for television\nbroadcasts at the athletes' expense.[42]\n\nThe [1972 Winter Games](/wiki/1972_Winter_Olympics \"1972 Winter Olympics\"),\nheld in [Sapporo](/wiki/Sapporo \"Sapporo\"), Japan, were the first to be hosted\non a continent other than North America or Europe. The issue of\nprofessionalism was disputed during these Games when a number of alpine skiers\nwere found to have participated in a ski camp at [Mammoth\nMountain](/wiki/Mammoth_Mountain \"Mammoth Mountain\") in the United States;\nthree days before the opening ceremony, IOC president [Avery\nBrundage](/wiki/Avery_Brundage \"Avery Brundage\") threatened to bar the skiers\nfrom competing in the Games as he insisted that they were no longer amateurs\nhaving benefited financially from their status as athletes.[43] Eventually\nonly [Austrian](/wiki/Austria_at_the_1972_Winter_Olympics \"Austria at the 1972\nWinter Olympics\") [Karl Schranz](/wiki/Karl_Schranz \"Karl Schranz\"), who\nearned more than the other skiers, was excluded from the competition.[44]\nCanada did not send teams to the\n[1972](/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1972_Winter_Olympics \"Ice hockey at the 1972\nWinter Olympics\") or [1976 ice hockey\ntournaments](/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1976_Winter_Olympics \"Ice hockey at the\n1976 Winter Olympics\") in protest at not being able to use players from\nprofessional leagues.[45] [Francisco Fernández\nOchoa](/wiki/Francisco_Fern%C3%A1ndez_Ochoa \"Francisco Fernández Ochoa\")\nbecame the first (and, as of 2018, only)\n[Spaniard](/wiki/Spain_at_the_1972_Winter_Olympics \"Spain at the 1972 Winter\nOlympics\") to win a Winter Olympic gold medal when he triumphed in the\n[slalom](/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_1972_Winter_Olympics \"Alpine skiing at the\n1972 Winter Olympics\").[46]\n\nThe [1976 Winter Olympics](/wiki/1976_Winter_Olympics \"1976 Winter Olympics\")\nhad initially been awarded in 1970 to [Denver](/wiki/Denver \"Denver\"),\n[Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\") in the United States. These Games would\nhave coincided with the year of Colorado's [centennial](/wiki/Centennial\n\"Centennial\") and the [United States\nBicentennial](/wiki/United_States_Bicentennial \"United States Bicentennial\").\nHowever, in November 1972 the people of Colorado voted against public funding\nof the Games by a 3:2 margin.[47][48] The IOC responded by offering the Games\nto [Vancouver](/wiki/Vancouver \"Vancouver\")-[Garibaldi](/wiki/Garibaldi_Ranges\n\"Garibaldi Ranges\"), British Columbia, which had previously been an official\ncandidate for the 1976 Games. However, a change in the provincial government\nresulted in an administration that did not support the Olympic bid, so the\nIOC's offer was rejected. [Salt Lake City](/wiki/Salt_Lake_City \"Salt Lake\nCity\"), previously a candidate for the 1972 Winter Olympics, then put itself\nforward, but the IOC opted instead to invite Innsbruck to host the 1976 Games,\nas most of the infrastructure from the 1964 Games had been maintained. Despite\nonly having half the usual time to prepare for the Games, Innsbruck accepted\nthe invitation to replace Denver in February 1973.[49] Two Olympic flames were\nlit because it was the second time that the Austrian town had hosted the\nWinter Games.[49] The 1976 Games featured the first [combination bobsleigh and\nluge track](/wiki/Igls_bobsleigh,_luge,_and_skeleton_track \"Igls bobsleigh,\nluge, and skeleton track\"), in neighbouring Igls.[46] The [Soviet\nUnion](/wiki/Soviet_Union_at_the_1976_Winter_Olympics \"Soviet Union at the\n1976 Winter Olympics\") won its fourth consecutive ice hockey gold medal.[49]\n\n[In 1980](/wiki/1980_Winter_Olympics \"1980 Winter Olympics\") the Winter\nOlympics returned to Lake Placid, which had hosted the 1932 Games.

The 2022 Winter\nOlympics will take place between 4 and 20 February 2022.\n\n## Controversy\n\nMain article: [Olympic Games scandals and controversies § Winter\nOlympics](/wiki/Olympic_Games_scandals_and_controversies#Winter_Olympics\n\"Olympic Games scandals and controversies\")\n\n[![a head shot of Juan Antonio Samaranch with dark glasses\non](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Juan_Antonio_Samaranch_DF-\nST-01-00128.jpg/170px-Juan_Antonio_Samaranch_DF-\nST-01-00128.jpg)](/wiki/File:Juan_Antonio_Samaranch_DF-ST-01-00128.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Juan_Antonio_Samaranch_DF-ST-01-00128.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJuan Antonio Samaranch, former IOC president, was implicated in a bidding\nscandal for the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe process for awarding host city honours came under intense scrutiny after\n[Salt Lake City](/wiki/Salt_Lake_City \"Salt Lake City\") had been awarded the\nright to host the 2002 Games.[99] Soon after the host city had been announced\nit was discovered that the organisers had engaged in an elaborate bribery\n[scheme](/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal \"2002 Winter Olympic bid\nscandal\") to curry favour with IOC officials.[99] Gifts and other financial\nconsiderations were given to those who would evaluate and vote on Salt Lake\nCity's bid. These gifts included medical treatment for relatives, a college\nscholarship for one member's son and a land deal in Utah. Even IOC president\n[Juan Antonio Samaranch](/wiki/Juan_Antonio_Samaranch \"Juan Antonio\nSamaranch\") received two rifles valued at $2,000. Samaranch defended the gift\nas inconsequential since, as president, he was a non-voting member.[100] The\nsubsequent investigation uncovered inconsistencies in the bids for every\nOlympics (both Summer and Winter) since 1988.[101] For example, the gifts\nreceived by IOC members from the Japanese Organising Committee for Nagano's\nbid for the [1998 Winter Olympics](/wiki/1998_Winter_Olympics \"1998 Winter\nOlympics\") were described by the investigation committee as\n\"astronomical\".[102] Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, the IOC\nfeared that corporate sponsors would lose faith in the integrity of the\nprocess and that the Olympic brand would be tarnished to such an extent that\nadvertisers would begin to pull their support.[103] The investigation resulted\nin the expulsion of 10 IOC members and the sanctioning of another 10. New\nterms and age limits were established for IOC membership, and 15 former\nOlympic athletes were added to the committee. Stricter rules for future bids\nwere imposed, with ceilings imposed on the value of gifts IOC members could\naccept from bid cities.[104][105][106]\n\n### Host city legacy\n\nAccording to the IOC, the host city for the Winter Olympics is responsible for\n\"...establishing functions and services for all aspects of the Games, such as\nsports planning, venues, finance, technology, accommodation, catering, media\nservices, etc., as well as operations during the Games.\"[107] Due to the cost\nof hosting the Games, most host cities never realise a profit on their\ninvestment.[108] For example, the [2006 Winter\nOlympics](/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics \"2006 Winter Olympics\") in\n[Turin](/wiki/Turin \"Turin\"), Italy, cost $3.6 billion to host. By comparison,\nthe [1998 Winter Olympics](/wiki/1998_Winter_Olympics \"1998 Winter Olympics\")\nin [Nagano](/wiki/Nagano \"Nagano\"), Japan, cost $12.5 billion.[109] The\norganisers of the Nagano Games claimed that the cost of extending the [bullet\ntrain](/wiki/Shinkansen \"Shinkansen\") service from [Tokyo](/wiki/Tokyo\n\"Tokyo\") to [Nagano](/wiki/Nagano \"Nagano\") was responsible for the large\nprice tag.[109] The organising committee had hoped that the exposure gained\nfrom hosting the Winter Olympics, and the improved access to Nagano from\nTokyo, would benefit the local economy for years afterwards. In actual fact,\nNagano's economy did experience a post-Olympic boom for a year or two, but the\nlong-term effects have not materialised as anticipated.[109] The likelihood of\nheavy debt is a deterrent to prospective host cities, as well as the prospect\nof unused sports venues and infrastructure saddling the local community with\nupkeep costs into the future with no appreciable post-Olympic value.[110]\n\nThe Winter Olympics has the added problem of the alpine events requiring a\nmountain location; the men's downhill needs an 800 meter altitude difference\nalong a suitable course. As this is a focal event that is central to the\nGames, the IOC will not agree to it taking place a great distance from the\nmain host city.[111] The requirement for a mountain location also means that\nvenues such as hockey arenas often have to be built in sparsely populated\nareas with little future need for a large arena. Due to cost issues, the only\ncandidate cities for the [2022 Winter Olympics](/wiki/2022_Winter_Olympics\n\"2022 Winter Olympics\") were in dictatorship countries, and a number of\nEuropean countries declined due to political doubt over costs. Both the\n[2006](/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics \"2006 Winter Olympics\") and\n[2010](/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics \"2010 Winter Olympics\") Games, which were\nhosted in countries where large cities are located close to suitable mountain\nregions, had lower costs since more venues and transport infrastructure\nalready existed.\n\nThe IOC has enacted several initiatives to mitigate these concerns. Firstly,\nthe commission has agreed to fund part of the host city's budget for staging\nthe Games.[112] Secondly, the qualifying host countries are limited to those\nthat have the resources and infrastructure to successfully host an Olympic\nGames without negatively impacting the region or nation; this consequently\nrules out a large portion of the developing world.[113] Finally, any\nprospective host city planning to bid for the Games is required to add a\n\"legacy plan\" to their proposal, with a view to the long-term economic and\nenvironmental impact that hosting the Olympics will have on the region.[114]\n\n### Doping\n\nIn 1967 the IOC began enacting drug testing protocols. They started by\nrandomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics.[115] The first Winter\nGames athlete to test positive for a banned substance was [Alois\nSchloder](/wiki/Alois_Schloder \"Alois Schloder\"), a [West\nGerman](/wiki/West_Germany_at_the_1972_Winter_Olympics \"West Germany at the\n1972 Winter Olympics\") hockey player,[116] but his team was still allowed to\ncompete.[117] During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated\nbecause it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing\ndrugs.[118] The problem with testing during this time was a lack of\nstandardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the credibility of\nthe tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting\nfederations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing\nprotocols.[119] The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it\nestablished the independent [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-\nDoping_Agency \"World Anti-Doping Agency\") (WADA) in November 1999.[120][121]\n\nThe 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin became notable for a scandal involving the\nemerging trend of [blood doping](/wiki/Blood_doping \"Blood doping\"), the use\nof blood transfusions or synthetic hormones such as\n[Erythropoietin](/wiki/Erythropoietin \"Erythropoietin\") (EPO) to improve\noxygen flow and thus reduce fatigue.[122] The Italian police conducted a raid\non the [Austrian](/wiki/Austria_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics \"Austria at the\n2006 Winter Olympics\") cross-country ski team's residence during the Games\nwhere they seized blood-doping specimens and equipment.[123] This event\nfollowed the pre-Olympics suspension of 12 cross-country skiers who tested\npositive for unusually high levels of [haemoglobin](/wiki/Hemoglobin\n\"Hemoglobin\"), which is evidence of blood doping.[122]\n\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi's Russian Doping Scandal has resulted in the\nInternational Olympic Committee to begin disciplinary proceedings against 28\n(later increased to 46) Russian athletes who competed at the 2014 Winter Games\nin Sochi, Russia, acting on evidence that their urine samples were tampered\nwith.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\n## Politics\n\n### Cold War\n\n[![A postage stamp with a blue background and two figure skaters skating, the\ndate 1968 is centered on the top of the stamp along with the Olympic rings.\nThe word \"Winterspiele\" is written down the right side, the words \"X\nOlympische\" are written down the left side.

It did not take\nlong for the Cold War combatants to discover what a powerful propaganda tool\nthe Olympic Games could be. The advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time\namateur athlete\" of the [Eastern Bloc](/wiki/Eastern_Bloc \"Eastern Bloc\")\ncountries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-\nfinanced amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [Soviet\nUnion](/wiki/Soviet_Union_at_the_Olympics \"Soviet Union at the Olympics\")\nentered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or\nworking in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to\ntrain on a full-time basis.[33] Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional\nrules regarding amateurism until the '90s.[129]\n\nThe Cold War created tensions amongst countries allied to the two superpowers.\nThe strained relationship between East and West Germany created a difficult\npolitical situation for the IOC. Because of its role in World War II, Germany\nwas not allowed to compete at the 1948 Winter Olympics.[24] In 1950 the IOC\nrecognised the West German Olympic Committee, and invited East and West\nGermany to compete as a unified team at the 1952 Winter Games.[130] East\nGermany declined the invitation and instead sought international legitimacy\nseparate from West Germany.[131] In 1955 the Soviet Union recognised East\nGermany as a sovereign state, thereby giving more credibility to East\nGermany's campaign to become an independent participant at the Olympics. The\nIOC agreed to provisionally accept the East German National Olympic Committee\nwith the condition that East and West Germans compete on one team.[132] The\nsituation became tenuous when the [Berlin Wall](/wiki/Berlin_Wall \"Berlin\nWall\") was constructed in 1962 and western nations began refusing visas to\nEast German athletes.[133] The uneasy compromise of a unified team held until\nthe 1968 Grenoble Games when the IOC officially split the teams and threatened\nto reject the host-city bids of any country that refused entry visas to East\nGerman athletes.[134]\n\n### Boycott\n\nThe Winter Games have had only one national team [boycott](/wiki/Boycott\n\"Boycott\") when [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\") decided not to participate in\nthe 1980 Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid. Prior to the Games the IOC\nagreed to allow China to compete in the Olympics for the first time since\n1952. China was given permission to compete as the \"People's Republic of\nChina\" (PRC) and to use the PRC flag and anthem. Until 1980 the island of\nTaiwan had been competing under the name \"Republic of China\" (ROC) and had\nbeen using the ROC flag and anthem.[50] The IOC attempted to have the\ncountries compete together but when this proved to be unacceptable the IOC\ndemanded that Taiwan cease to call itself the \"Republic of China\".[135][136]\nThe IOC renamed the island \"[Chinese Taipei](/wiki/Chinese_Taipei \"Chinese\nTaipei\")\" and demanded that it adopt a different flag and national anthem,\nstipulations that Taiwan would not agree to. Despite numerous appeals and\ncourt hearings the IOC's decision stood. When the Taiwanese athletes arrived\nat the Olympic village with their Republic of China identification cards they\nwere not admitted. They subsequently left the Olympics in protest, just before\nthe opening ceremonies.[50] Taiwan returned to Olympic competition at the 1984\nWinter Games in Sarajevo as Chinese Taipei. The country agreed to compete\nunder a flag bearing the emblem of their National Olympic Committee and to\nplay the anthem of their National Olympic Committee should one of their\nathletes win a gold medal. The agreement remains in place to this day.[137]\n\n## Sports\n\nThe [Olympic Charter](/wiki/Olympic_Charter \"Olympic Charter\") limits [winter\nsports](/wiki/Winter_sports \"Winter sports\") to \"those ... which are practised\non snow or ice.\"[138] Since 1992 a number of new sports have been added to the\nOlympic programme; which include short track speed skating, snowboarding,\nfreestyle and moguls skiing. The addition of these events has broadened the\nappeal of the Winter Olympics beyond Europe and North America. While European\npowers such as Norway and Germany still dominate the traditional Winter\nOlympic sports, countries such as South Korea, Australia and Canada are\nfinding success in the new sports. The results are: more parity in the\nnational medal tables; more interest in the Winter Olympics; and higher global\ntelevision ratings.[139]\n\n### Current sports\n\nSport | Years | Events | Medal events contested in 2014  \n---|---|---|---  \n[Alpine skiing](/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1936 | 11 | Men's and women's [downhill](/wiki/Downhill_\\(ski_competition\\) \"Downhill \\(ski competition\\)\"), [super G](/wiki/Super_giant_slalom_skiing \"Super giant slalom skiing\"), [giant slalom](/wiki/Giant_slalom_skiing \"Giant slalom skiing\"), [slalom](/wiki/Slalom_skiing \"Slalom skiing\"), and [combined](/wiki/Alpine_skiing_combined \"Alpine skiing combined\"), and [parallel slalom](/w/index.php?title=Mix-paralell_slalom&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Mix-paralell slalom \\(page does not exist\\)\").[140]  \n[Biathlon](/wiki/Biathlon_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Biathlon at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1960Note 3 | 11 | Sprint (men: 10 km; women: 7.5 km), the individual (men: 20 km; women: 15 km), pursuit (men: 12.5 km; women: 10 km), relay (men: 4x7.5 km; women: 4x6 km; mixed: 2x7.5 km+2x6 km), and the mass start (men: 15 km; women: 12.5 km).[141]  \n[Bobsleigh](/wiki/Bobsleigh_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Bobsleigh at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1924 (except 1960) | 3 | Four-man race, two-man race and two-woman race.[142]  \n[Cross-country skiing](/wiki/Cross-country_skiing_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Cross-country skiing at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1924 | 12 | Men's sprint, team sprint, 30 km pursuit, 15 km, 50 km and 4x10 km relay; women's sprint, team sprint, 15 km pursuit, 10 km, 30 km and 4x5 km relay.[143]  \n[Curling](/wiki/Curling_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Curling at the Winter Olympics\") | 1924, since 1998 | 3 | Men's, women's and mixed doubles. tournaments.[144]  \n[Figure skating](/wiki/Figure_skating_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Figure skating at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1924Note 1 | 5 | Men's and women's singles; pairs; ice dancing and team event.[145]  \n[Freestyle skiing](/wiki/Freestyle_skiing_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Freestyle skiing at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1992 | 10 | Men's and women's [moguls](/wiki/Mogul_skiing \"Mogul skiing\"), [aerials](/wiki/Aerial_skiing \"Aerial skiing\"), [ski cross](/wiki/Ski_cross \"Ski cross\"), [superpipe](/wiki/Superpipe \"Superpipe\"), and [slopestyle](/wiki/Slopestyle \"Slopestyle\").[146]  \n[Ice hockey](/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Ice hockey at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1924Note 2 | 2 | Men's and women's tournaments.[147]  \n[Luge](/wiki/Luge_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Luge at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1964 | 4 | Men's and women's singles, men's doubles, team relay.[148]  \n[Nordic combined](/wiki/Nordic_combined_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1924 | 3 | Men's 10 km individual normal hill, 10 km individual large hill and team.[149]  \n[Short track speed skating](/wiki/Short_track_speed_skating_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Short track speed skating at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1992 | 8 | Men's and women's 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m; women's 3000 m relay; and men's 5000 m relay.[150]  \n[Skeleton](/wiki/Skeleton_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Skeleton at the Winter Olympics\") | 1928, 1948, Since 2002 | 2 | Men's and women's events.[151]  \n[Ski jumping](/wiki/Ski_jumping_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Ski jumping at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1924 | 4 | Men's individual large hill, team large hill;[152] men's and women's individual normal hill.  \n[Snowboarding](/wiki/Snowboarding_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Snowboarding at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1998 | 8 | Men's and women's parallel, half-pipe, snowboard cross, and slopestyle.[153]  \n[Speed skating](/wiki/Speed_skating_at_the_Winter_Olympics \"Speed skating at the Winter Olympics\") | Since 1924 | 14 | Men's and women's 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, 5000 m, mass start, team pursuit; women's 3000 m; men's 10,000 m.[154]  \n  \n**^** Note 1.
