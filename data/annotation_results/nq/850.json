Gilbert Ave., apartment 17C, in a [housing\nproject](/wiki/Public_housing \"Public housing\") in a poor, black neighborhood\nin inner-city Chicago. The project is unnamed on the show, but is implicitly\nthe infamous [Cabrini–Green](/wiki/Cabrini%E2%80%93Green \"Cabrini–Green\")\nprojects, shown in the opening and closing credits.[1][2] Florida and James\nhave three children: [James Jr.](/wiki/J._J._Evans \"J. J. Evans\"), also known\nas \"J.J.\"; [Thelma](/wiki/Thelma_Evans \"Thelma Evans\"); and\n[Michael](/wiki/Michael_Evans_\\(Good_Times\\) \"Michael Evans \\(Good Times\\)\"),\ncalled \"the militant midget\" by his father due to his passionate\n[activism](/wiki/Activism \"Activism\"). When the series begins, J.J. is\nseventeen years old, Thelma is sixteen, and Michael is eleven. Their exuberant\nneighbor, and Florida's best friend, is Willona Woods, a recent divorcée who\nworks at a boutique. Their [building\nsuperintendent](/wiki/Building_superintendent \"Building superintendent\") is\nNathan Bookman (seasons 2–6), who James, Willona and later J.J. refer to as\n\"Buffalo Butt\", or, even more derisively, \"Booger\".\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Good_times_1974.JPG/150px-\nGood_times_1974.JPG)](/wiki/File:Good_times_1974.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Good_times_1974.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nFlorida and son J.J., 1974\n\nThe characters originated on the sitcom _[Maude](/wiki/Maude_\\(TV_series\\)\n\"Maude \\(TV series\\)\")_ as Florida and Henry Evans, with Florida employed as\n[Maude Findlay](/wiki/Maude_Findlay_\\(character\\) \"Maude Findlay\n\\(character\\)\")'s housekeeper in [Tuckahoe, New\nYork](/wiki/Tuckahoe,_Westchester_County,_New_York \"Tuckahoe, Westchester\nCounty, New York\"), and Henry employed as a firefighter. When producers\ndecided to feature the Florida character in her own show, they\n[changed](/wiki/Retroactive_continuity \"Retroactive continuity\") the\ncharacters' history: Henry's name became James, there was no mention of Maude,\nand the couple lived in [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\").[3]\n\nEpisodes of _Good Times_ deal with the characters' attempts to overcome\npoverty living in a high rise project building in Chicago. James Evans often\nworks at least two jobs, mostly manual labor such as dishwasher, construction\nlaborer, etc. Often he is unemployed, but he is a proud man who will not\naccept charity. When he has to, he hustles money playing pool, although\nFlorida disapproves of this.\n\n### Cast conflicts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Good_Times&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast conflicts\")]\n\n_Good Times_ was intended to be a good show for Esther Rolle and John Amos.\nBoth expected the show to deal with serious topics in a comedic way while\nproviding positive characters for viewers to identify with.\n\nHowever, Jimmie Walker's character of J.J. was an immediate hit with audiences\nand became the [breakout character](/wiki/Breakout_character \"Breakout\ncharacter\") of the series. J.J.'s frequent use of the expression \"Dy-no-mite!\"\n(often in the phrase \"Kid Dy-no-mite!\"), credited to director [John\nRich](/wiki/John_Rich_\\(director\\) \"John Rich \\(director\\)\"), became a popular\n[catchphrase](/wiki/Catchphrase \"Catchphrase\") (later included in [TV\nLand](/wiki/TV_Land \"TV Land\")'s _The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch\nPhrases_ special).[4] Rich insisted Walker say it in every episode. Walker and\nexecutive producer [Norman Lear](/wiki/Norman_Lear \"Norman Lear\") were\nskeptical of the idea, but the phrase and the J.J. Evans character caught on\nwith the audience.[5] As a result of the character's popularity, the writers\nfocused more on J.J.'s comedic antics instead of serious issues.\n\nThrough seasons two and three, Rolle and Amos grew increasingly disillusioned\nwith the direction of the show and especially with J.J.'s antics and\nstereotypically buffoonish behavior.[6] Rolle was vocal about her dislike of\nhis character. In a 1975 interview with _[Ebony](/wiki/Ebony_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Ebony \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine she stated:\n\n> He's 18 and he doesn't work. He can't read or write. He doesn't think. The\n> show didn't start out to be that...Little by little—with the help of the\n> artist, I suppose, because they couldn't do that to me—they have made J.J.\n> more stupid and enlarged the role. Negative images have been slipped in on\n> us through the character of the oldest child.[7]\n\nAlthough doing so less publicly, Amos also was outspoken about his\ndissatisfaction with the J.J. character. Amos stated:\n\n> The writers would prefer to put a chicken hat on J.J. and have him prance\n> around saying \"DY-NO-MITE\", and that way they could waste a few minutes and\n> not have to write meaningful dialogue.[8]\n\nWhile Amos was less public with his dissatisfaction, he was ultimately fired\nafter season three due to disagreements with Norman Lear. Amos' departure was\ninitially attributed to his desire to focus on a film career, but he admitted\nin a 1976 interview that Lear called him and told him that his contract option\nwith the show was not being renewed. Amos stated, \"That's the same thing as\nbeing fired.\"[9] The producers decided not to recast the character of James\nEvans, instead opting to [kill off](/wiki/Kill_off \"Kill off\") the character\nin the two-part season four episode, \"The Big Move\".[10][11]\n\n### Final seasons[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Good_Times&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Final seasons\")]\n\nBy the end of season four, Esther Rolle had also become dissatisfied with the\nshow's direction and decided to leave the series. In the final two episodes of\nthe season, \"Love Has a Spot On His Lung\", Rolle's character gets engaged to\nCarl Dixon ([Moses Gunn](/wiki/Moses_Gunn \"Moses Gunn\")), a man she began\ndating toward the end of season four. In the season five premiere episode, it\nis revealed that Florida and Carl married off screen and moved to\n[Arizona](/wiki/Arizona \"Arizona\") for the sake of Carl's health.[12]\n\nWith Amos and Rolle gone, Ja'net Dubois took over as the lead character, as\nWillona checked in on the Evans children since they were now living\nalone.[2][13] In season five [Janet Jackson](/wiki/Janet_Jackson \"Janet\nJackson\") joined the cast, playing Penny Gordon Woods, an\n[abused](/wiki/Child_abuse \"Child abuse\") girl who is abandoned by her mother\nand eventually [adopted](/wiki/Adopted \"Adopted\") by Willona.[12]\n\nBefore taping of season six began, CBS and the show's producers decided that\nthey had to do \"something drastic\" to increase viewership. According to then-\nvice president of CBS programming Steve Mills, \"We had lost the essence of the\nshow. Without parental guidance the show slipped. Everything told us that: our\nmail, our phone calls, our research. We felt we had to go back to basics.\"[12]\n\nProducers approached Esther Rolle with an offer to appear in a guest role on\nthe series. Rolle was initially hesitant but when producers agreed to a number\nof her demands (including an increased salary and higher quality scripts), she\nagreed to return to the series on a full-time basis. Rolle also wanted\nproducers to make the character of J.J. more responsible, as she felt the\ncharacter was a poor role model for black American youths. She also requested\nthat producers write out the character of Carl Dixon; Rolle reportedly\ndisliked the storyline surrounding the Carl Dixon character, as she believed\nFlorida would not have moved on so quickly after James' death or leave her\nchildren. Rolle also thought the writers had disregarded Florida's devout\n[Christian](/wiki/Christianity \"Christianity\") beliefs by having her fall for\nand marry Carl, who was an [atheist](/wiki/Atheism \"Atheism\").[12][14]\n\nIn the season six premiere episode \"Florida's Homecoming: Part 1\", Florida\nreturns from Arizona without Carl to attend Thelma's upcoming wedding to\nprofessional football player Keith Anderson ([Ben Powers](/wiki/Ben_Powers\n\"Ben Powers\"), who joined the cast for the final season). In a rare uncut\nversion of \"Florida's Homecoming: Part 2\", after Florida arrives home from\nArizona, Willona briefly pulls her aside and mentions Carl, to which Florida\nsadly smiles and shakes her head implying that Carl had died from cancer.\nFlorida later mentions Carl one last time when she tells Michael about a book\nthey'd both bought him.[3] Despite changes in the series at Esther Rolle's\nrequest and her return, ratings did not improve and CBS canceled the series\nduring the 1978–79 season.[15][16]\n\nIn the [series finale](/wiki/Series_finale \"Series finale\"), \"The End of the\nRainbow\", each character finally gets a \"happy ending.\" J.J. gets his big\nbreak as an artist for a [comic book](/wiki/Comic_book \"Comic book\") company\nwith his newly created character, DynoWoman, which is based on Thelma (much to\nher surprise and delight), and is moving into an apartment with some lady\nfriends. Michael attends college and moves into an on-campus dorm. Keith's bad\nknee heals due to his exercise and own physical therapy, leading to the\n[Chicago Bears](/wiki/Chicago_Bears \"Chicago Bears\") offering him a contract\nto play [football](/wiki/American_football \"American football\"). Keith\nannounces that he and Thelma are moving into a luxury apartment in the city's\nupscale [Gold Coast](/wiki/Gold_Coast_Historic_District_\\(Chicago\\) \"Gold\nCoast Historic District \\(Chicago\\)\") district. Thelma also announces that she\nis pregnant with the couple's first child. Keith offers Florida the chance to\nmove in with them so she can help Thelma with the new baby. Willona becomes\nthe head buyer of the boutique she works in and announces that she and Penny\nare also moving out of the projects. Willona then reveals that her new\napartment is in the same apartment building that Keith, Thelma and Florida are\nmoving to; once again, she and Penny become the Evans' downstairs\nneighbors.[16]\n\n## Cast and\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Good_Times&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Cast and characters\")]\n\n### Main[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Good_Times&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Main\")]\n\nActor | Character | Seasons  \n---|---|---  \n1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  \n[Esther Rolle](/wiki/Esther_Rolle \"Esther Rolle\") | Florida Evans | [Main](/wiki/Ensemble_cast \"Ensemble cast\") |  | Main  \n[John Amos](/wiki/John_Amos \"John Amos\") | James Evans | Main |   \n[Ja'net Dubois](/wiki/Ja%27net_Dubois \"Ja'net Dubois\") | Willona Woods | Main  \n[Jimmie Walker](/wiki/Jimmie_Walker \"Jimmie Walker\") | James \"J.J.\" Evans, Jr. | Main  \n[Ralph Carter](/wiki/Ralph_Carter \"Ralph Carter\") | Michael Evans | Main  \n[Bern Nadette Stanis](/wiki/Bern_Nadette_Stanis \"Bern Nadette Stanis\")* | Thelma Evans Anderson | Main  \n[Johnny Brown](/wiki/Johnny_Brown_\\(actor\\) \"Johnny Brown \\(actor\\)\") | Nathan Bookman |  | [Recurring](/wiki/Recurring_character \"Recurring character\") | Main  \n[Janet Jackson](/wiki/Janet_Jackson \"Janet Jackson\") | Millicent \"Penny\" Gordon Woods |  | Main  \n[Ben Powers](/wiki/Ben_Powers \"Ben Powers\") | Keith Anderson |  | Main  \n*Bern Nadette Stanis was credited as \"Bern Nadette\" during early episodes of season one, and later as \"Bernnadette Stanis.\"  \n  \n### Minor\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Good_Times&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Minor characters\")]\n\n  * Ned the Wino ([Raymond Allen](/wiki/Raymond_Allen_\\(television_actor\\) \"Raymond Allen \\(television actor\\)\")) is the local [drunk](/wiki/Low-end_fortified_wine \"Low-end fortified wine\") who frequents the neighborhood and the apartment building where the Evans family reside. In the season one episode \"Black Jesus\", J.J. uses Ned the Wino as the model for a portrait of [Jesus](/wiki/Jesus \"Jesus\"). Another episode is centered on Michael's plan to \"clean up\" Ned and get him off the booze by letting him stay at the Evans' house.\n  * Carl Dixon ([Moses Gunn](/wiki/Moses_Gunn \"Moses Gunn\")) is an [atheist](/wiki/Atheist \"Atheist\") shop owner who Michael briefly works for. Despite their religious differences, Carl and Florida begin dating and become engaged in the final episode of season four. Carl breaks off the engagement after he is diagnosed with lung cancer. After a talk from Bookman, Carl again asks Florida for her hand in marriage. The two marry off-screen and move to Arizona. Florida returns at the beginning of season six, without Carl, for Thelma's wedding. Carl is referenced briefly in episode two of season six, but he is never mentioned again (Florida continues to use the surname Evans instead of Dixon). (Esther Rolle decided to come back to the show if the character was written out.) Florida then revealed he died from his battle of lung cancer.\n  * Marion \"Sweet Daddy\" Williams ([Theodore Wilson](/wiki/Theodore_Wilson \"Theodore Wilson\")) is a menacing neighborhood [numbers](/wiki/Numbers_game \"Numbers game\") runner and [pimp](/wiki/Pimp \"Pimp\"), who has a reputation for wearing flashy clothing and jewelry. He is usually accompanied by bodyguards (one portrayed by [Bubba Smith](/wiki/Bubba_Smith \"Bubba Smith\"), the other by series painter [Ernie Barnes](/wiki/Ernie_Barnes \"Ernie Barnes\")) and comes across as cool and threatening, but has shown a soft heart on occasion, particularly when he decided not to take an antique locket (to settle a debt) that Florida had given to Thelma because it had reminded him of his late mother. (Wilson also plays a club owner named Stanley in the season four episode, \"The Comedian and the Loan Sharks\").\n  * [Alderman](/wiki/Alderman \"Alderman\") Fred C. Davis ([Albert Reed, Jr.](/wiki/Albert_Reed,_Jr. \"Albert Reed, Jr.\")) is a local politician with a slightly shady disposition whom the Evans generally despise. Spoofing President [Richard M. Nixon](/wiki/Richard_M._Nixon \"Richard M. Nixon\"), he would state in a speech \"I am not a crook.\" He frequently relies on the support of the Evans family (his \"favorite project family\") for reelection or support and resorts to threats of eviction to secure their support. In a running joke, Alderman Davis frequently forgets Willona's name and calls her another similar-sounding name that began with a \"W\" (such as Wilhemina, Winnifrieda, Winsomnium, Wyomia and even Waldorf-Astoria), thus earning him her everlasting ire as well as the nickname \"Baldy\".\n  * Lenny ([Dap 'Sugar' Willie](/wiki/Dap_%27Sugar%27_Willie \"Dap 'Sugar' Willie\")) is a neighborhood hustler and peddler who tries to sell presumably stolen items that are usually attached to the lining of his fur coat. He usually approaches people with a laid-back rap and a rhyme (\"my name is Len-nay, if I ain't got it, there ain't an-nay\"). He is typically rebuffed by the people he approaches and responds by saying \"that's cold\" or uses a small brush to \"brush off\" the negativity.\n  * \"Grandpa\" Henry Evans ([Richard Ward](/wiki/Richard_Ward_\\(American_actor\\) \"Richard Ward \\(American actor\\)\")) is James' long lost father. He abandoned the family years before because he was ashamed that he could not do more to provide for them. This hurt James deeply, who disregarded his father's existence, telling everyone he was dead. Thelma learns about her grandfather while doing some family research. She meets him and invites him to the Evans' home to surprise James for his birthday, not knowing that James was well aware of his whereabouts but chose to stay out of his life. After Henry arrives at the Evans home and meets the rest of the family, he realizes that James would not welcome him in the home and decides to leave. Florida convinces him to stay and talk to James and explains that there may never be another chance to do so. Henry and James have a heart-to-heart talk, with Henry being remorseful and apologetic. James ultimately forgives his father. After James' death, the Evans family embraces Henry into the family, alongside his [common law](/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\") (and eventually legal) wife Lena in later episodes.\n  * Wanda ([Helen Martin](/wiki/Helen_Martin \"Helen Martin\")) is another resident in the apartment building where the Evans reside. Earlier episodes show her at a women's support group, and the tenants rallying around her by giving her a [rent party](/wiki/Rent_party \"Rent party\"). Later episodes show her appearing and crying at several funerals, whether she knew the person or not, thus earning her the nickname \"Weeping Wanda\" from J.J. and Willona.\n  * Mrs. Lynnetta Gordon ([Chip Fields](/wiki/Chip_Fields \"Chip Fields\")) is Penny's [abusive](/wiki/Child_abuse \"Child abuse\") biological mother. Her first appearance is in the four part Fifth season opening episode, \"The Evans Get Involved\". Penny's father abandoned Mrs. Gordon when she became pregnant. As a result, she takes her anger and frustrations out on Penny, including burning her with a hot iron. After the abuse is finally brought to light, (during which Mrs. Gordon gets into a shouting match with Willona and Thelma) she abandons Penny, despite Willona and Thelma's pleas to her to seek help. Just before she disappears, Mrs. Gordon expresses regret for hurting her child, telling Willona that Penny deserves better than her. This clears the way for Willona to adopt Penny. She reappears more than a year later, in the sixth-season episode, \"A Matter of Mothers\", having remarried, and reveals that her new husband is from a very wealthy family. Mrs. Gordon uses her husband's wealth to send Penny anonymous gifts and, in an effort to regain custody of Penny, she also attempts to [frame](/wiki/Frameup \"Frameup\") Willona as an unfit adoptive parent who throws wild parties with less than wholesome attendees. However, her scheme is exposed by being recorded on tape admitting that the scheme was a set up to get Penny back. After trying to get the tape from Penny and threatening her again with physical abuse (which is stopped by Willona), Penny outright rejects Mrs. Gordon, telling her birth mother that no matter what anyone says, she would always consider Willona to be her real mother. Mrs. Gordon is devastated by this, agrees to drop the charges against Willona and leaves Penny with her, never to be seen again.\n  * Cleatus ([Jack Baker](/wiki/Jack_Baker_\\(actor\\) \"Jack Baker \\(actor\\)\")) is a cousin of J.J. Evans, Thelma Evans Anderson, and Michael Evans and nephew of Florida Evans and James Evans. He made one appearance in the episode \"Cousin Cleatus\".\n  * Violet Bookman ([Marilyn Coleman](/w/index.php?title=Marilyn_Coleman&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Marilyn Coleman \\(page does not exist\\)\")) is the wife of Bookman (episodes: \"Bye, Bye Bookman\" and \"Willona, the Other Woman\" in season 5).\n\n### Notable guest\nstars[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Good_Times&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Notable guest stars\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Good_Times_Lou_Gossett_1976.JPG/220px-\nGood_Times_Lou_Gossett_1976.JPG)](/wiki/File:Good_Times_Lou_Gossett_1976.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Good_Times_Lou_Gossett_1976.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Louis Gossett, Jr.](/wiki/Louis_Gossett,_Jr. \"Louis Gossett, Jr.\") as\nFlorida's brother, Wilbert\n\n  * [Debbie Allen](/wiki/Debbie_Allen \"Debbie Allen\") as J.J.'s drug-addicted fiancee, Diana in \"J.J.'s Fiancee (Parts 1 & 2)\" (season 3)\n  * [Matthew \"Stymie\" Beard](/wiki/Matthew_%22Stymie%22_Beard \"Matthew \"Stymie\" Beard\") (former _[Our Gang](/wiki/Our_Gang \"Our Gang\")_ child actor) in five episodes, including four appearances as James' friend Monty\n  * [Sorrell Booke](/wiki/Sorrell_Booke \"Sorrell Booke\") as Mr. Galbraith, J.J.'s boss at the ad agency (season 5, episode 17)\n  * [Roscoe Lee Browne](/wiki/Roscoe_Lee_Browne \"Roscoe Lee Browne\") as a shady televangelist Reverend Sam \"the Happiness Man\", who befriended James in the military (season 1, episode 4)\n  * [T.
