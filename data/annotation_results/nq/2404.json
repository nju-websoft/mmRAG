The\nnobleman then has the play performed for Sly's diversion.\n\nThe main plot depicts the [courtship](/wiki/Courtship \"Courtship\") of\n[Petruchio](/wiki/Petruchio \"Petruchio\") and Katherina, the headstrong,\nobdurate [shrew](/wiki/Shrew_\\(stock_character\\) \"Shrew \\(stock character\\)\").\nInitially, Katherina is an unwilling participant in the relationship; however,\nPetruchio \"tames\" her with various psychological torments, such as keeping her\nfrom eating and drinking, until she becomes a desirable, compliant, and\nobedient bride. The [subplot](/wiki/Subplot \"Subplot\") features a competition\nbetween the suitors of Katherina's younger sister,\n[Bianca](/wiki/Bianca_Minola \"Bianca Minola\"), who is seen as the \"ideal\"\nwoman. The question of whether the play is [misogynistic](/wiki/Misogyny\n\"Misogyny\") or not has become the subject of considerable controversy,\nparticularly among modern scholars, audiences, and readers.\n\n_The Taming of the Shrew_ has been adapted numerous times for stage, screen,\nopera, ballet, and musical theatre; perhaps the most famous adaptations being\n[Cole Porter](/wiki/Cole_Porter \"Cole Porter\")'s _[Kiss Me,\nKate](/wiki/Kiss_Me,_Kate \"Kiss Me, Kate\")_ and [the 1967\nfilm](/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_\\(1967_film\\) \"The Taming of the Shrew\n\\(1967 film\\)\") of the play, starring [Elizabeth\nTaylor](/wiki/Elizabeth_Taylor \"Elizabeth Taylor\") and [Richard\nBurton](/wiki/Richard_Burton \"Richard Burton\"). The 1999 high school comedy\nfilm _[10 Things I Hate About You](/wiki/10_Things_I_Hate_About_You \"10 Things\nI Hate About You\")_ is also loosely based on the play.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Characters\n  * 2 Synopsis\n  * 3 Sources\n  * 4 Date and text\n    * 4.1 Date\n    * 4.2 Text\n  * 5 Analysis and criticism\n    * 5.1 Critical history\n      * 5.1.1 The relationship with _A Shrew_\n      * 5.1.2 Hortensio problem\n      * 5.1.3 Controversy\n      * 5.1.4 Induction\n    * 5.2 Language\n    * 5.3 Themes\n      * 5.3.1 Female submissiveness\n      * 5.3.2 Gender politics\n      * 5.3.3 Cruelty\n      * 5.3.4 Money\n  * 6 Performance\n  * 7 Adaptations\n    * 7.1 Plays\n    * 7.2 Opera\n    * 7.3 Musical/Ballet\n    * 7.4 Film\n    * 7.5 Television\n    * 7.6 Radio\n  * 8 References\n    * 8.1 Notes\n    * 8.2 Citations\n    * 8.3 Editions of _The Taming of the Shrew_\n    * 8.4 Secondary sources\n  * 9 External links\n\n##\nCharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Characters\")]\n\n  * Katherina (Kate) Minola – the \"[shrew](/wiki/Shrew_\\(stock_character\\) \"Shrew \\(stock character\\)\")\" of the title\n  * [Bianca Minola](/wiki/Bianca_Minola \"Bianca Minola\") – sister of Katherina; the _[ingénue](/wiki/Ing%C3%A9nue \"Ingénue\")_\n  * Baptista Minola – father of Katherina and Bianca\n  * [Petruchio](/wiki/Petruchio \"Petruchio\") – suitor of Katherina\n  * Gremio – elderly suitor of Bianca\n  * Lucentio – suitor of Bianca\n  * Hortensio – suitor of Bianca and friend to Petruchio\n  * Grumio – Petruchio's manservant\n  * Tranio – Lucentio's manservant\n  * Biondello – servant of Lucentio\n  * Vincentio – father of Lucentio\n  * Widow – wooed by Hortensio\n  * [Pedant](/wiki/Pedant \"Pedant\") – pretends to be Vincentio\n  * [Haberdasher](/wiki/Haberdasher \"Haberdasher\")\n  * [Tailor](/wiki/Tailor \"Tailor\")\n  * Curtis – servant of Petruchio\n  * Nathaniel – servant of Petruchio\n  * Joseph – servant of Petruchio\n  * Peter – servant of Petruchio\n  * Nicholas – servant of Petruchio\n  * Philip – servant of Petruchio\n  * Officer\n\n_Characters appearing in the Induction:_\n\n  * [Christopher Sly](/wiki/Christopher_Sly \"Christopher Sly\") – a drunken tinker\n  * Hostess of an alehouse\n  * Lord – plays a prank on Sly\n  * Bartholomew – Lord's [page boy](/wiki/Page_\\(servant\\) \"Page \\(servant\\)\")\n  * Lord's Huntsman\n  * Players\n  * Servingmen\n  * Messenger\n\n##\nSynopsis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Synopsis\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/The_Shrew_Katherina_%28Hughes%29.jpg/150px-\nThe_Shrew_Katherina_%28Hughes%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Shrew_Katherina_\\(Hughes\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Shrew_Katherina_\\(Hughes\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_The Shrew Katherina_ by [Edward Robert Hughes](/wiki/Edward_Robert_Hughes\n\"Edward Robert Hughes\") (1898).\n\nPrior to the first act, an [induction](/wiki/Induction_\\(play\\) \"Induction\n\\(play\\)\") frames the play as a \"kind of history\" played in front of a\nbefuddled drunkard named [Christopher Sly](/wiki/Christopher_Sly \"Christopher\nSly\") who is tricked into believing that he is a lord. The play is performed\nin order to distract Sly from his \"wife,\" who is actually Bartholomew, a\nservant, dressed as a woman.\n\nIn the play performed for Sly, the \"shrew\" is Katherina, the eldest daughter\nof Baptista Minola, a lord in [Padua](/wiki/Padua \"Padua\"). Numerous men,\nincluding Gremio and Tranio, deem Katherina an unworthy option for marriage\nbecause of her notorious assertiveness and willfulness. On the other hand, men\nsuch as Hortensio and Gremio are eager to marry her younger sister\n[Bianca](/wiki/Bianca_Minola \"Bianca Minola\"). However, Baptista has sworn\nBianca is not allowed to marry until Katherina is wed; this motivates Bianca's\nsuitors to work together to find Katherina a husband so that they may compete\nfor Bianca. The plot thickens when Lucentio, who has recently come to Padua to\nattend university, falls in love with Bianca. Overhearing Baptista say that he\nis on the lookout for tutors for his daughters, Lucentio devises a plan in\nwhich he disguises himself as a Latin tutor named Cambio in order to woo\nBianca behind Baptista's back and meanwhile has his servant Tranio pretend to\nbe him.\n\nIn the meantime, [Petruchio](/wiki/Petruchio \"Petruchio\"), accompanied by his\nservant Grumio, arrives in Padua from [Verona](/wiki/Verona \"Verona\"). He\nexplains to Hortensio, an old friend of his, that since his father's death he\nhas set out to enjoy life and wed. Hearing this, Hortensio recruits Petruchio\nas a suitor for Katherina. He also has Petruchio present Baptista a music\ntutor named Litio (Hortensio in disguise). Thus, Lucentio and Hortensio,\nattempt to woo Bianca while pretending to be the tutors Cambio and Litio.\n\nTo counter Katherina's shrewish nature, Petruchio pretends that any harsh\nthings she says or does are actually kind and gentle. Katherina agrees to\nmarry Petruchio after seeing that he is the only man willing to counter her\nquick remarks; however, at the ceremony Petruchio makes an embarrassing scene\nwhen he strikes the priest and drinks the [communion\nwine](/wiki/Sacramental_wine \"Sacramental wine\"). After the wedding, Petruchio\ntakes Katherina to his home against her will. Once they are gone, Gremio and\nTranio (disguised as Lucentio) formally bid for Bianca, with Tranio easily\noutbidding Gremio. However, in his zeal to win, he promises much more than\nLucentio actually possesses. When Baptista determines that once Lucentio's\nfather confirms the [dowry](/wiki/Dowry \"Dowry\"), Bianca and Tranio (i.e.\nLucentio) can marry, Tranio decides that they will need someone to pretend to\nbe Vincentio, Lucentio's father. Meanwhile, Tranio persuades Hortensio that\nBianca is not worthy of his attentions, thus removing Lucentio's remaining\nrival.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Taming_of_the_Shrew.jpg/220px-\nTaming_of_the_Shrew.jpg)](/wiki/File:Taming_of_the_Shrew.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Taming_of_the_Shrew.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[C.R. Leslie](/wiki/Charles_Robert_Leslie \"Charles Robert Leslie\")\nillustration of Act 4, Scene 3 (Petruchio upbraiding the tailor for making an\nill-fitting dress). From the _[Illustrated London\nNews](/wiki/The_Illustrated_London_News \"The Illustrated London News\")_ , 3\nNovember 1886; engraved by [William Luson Thomas](/wiki/William_Luson_Thomas\n\"William Luson Thomas\").\n\nIn Verona, Petruchio begins the \"taming\" of his new wife. She is refused food\nand clothing because nothing – according to Petruchio – is good enough for\nher; he claims that perfectly cooked meat is overcooked, a beautiful dress\ndoesn't fit right, and a stylish hat is not fashionable. He also disagrees\nwith everything that she says, forcing her to agree with everything that he\nsays, no matter how absurd; on their way back to Padua to attend Bianca's\nwedding, she agrees with Petruchio that the sun is the moon, and proclaims \"if\nyou please to call it a rush-candle,/Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me\"\n(4.5.14–15). Along the way, they meet Vincentio, who is also on his way to\nPadua, and Katherina agrees with Petruchio when he declares that Vincentio is\na woman and then apologises to Vincentio when Petruchio tells her that he is a\nman.\n\nBack in Padua, Lucentio and Tranio convince a passing pedant to pretend to be\nVincentio and confirm the dowry for Bianca. The man does so, and Baptista is\nhappy for Bianca to wed Lucentio (still Tranio in disguise). Bianca, aware of\nthe deception, then secretly elopes with the real Lucentio to get married.\nHowever, when Vincentio reaches Padua, he encounters the pedant, who claims to\nbe Lucentio's father. Tranio (still disguised as Lucentio) appears, and the\npedant acknowledges him to be his son Lucentio. In all the confusion, the real\nVincentio is set to be arrested, when the real Lucentio appears with his newly\nbetrothed Bianca, revealing all to a bewildered Baptista and Vincentio.\nLucentio explains everything, and all is forgiven by the two fathers.\n\nMeanwhile, Hortensio has married a rich widow. In the final scene of the play\nthere are three newly married couples; Bianca and Lucentio, the widow and\nHortensio, and Katherina and Petruchio. Because of the general opinion that\nPetruchio is married to a shrew, a good-natured quarrel breaks out amongst the\nthree men about whose wife is the most obedient. Petruchio proposes a wager\nwhereby each will send a servant to call for their wives, and whichever comes\nmost obediently will have won the wager for her husband. Katherina is the only\none of the three who comes, winning the wager for Petruchio. She then hauls\nthe other two wives into the room, giving a speech on why wives should always\nobey their husbands. The play ends with Baptista, Hortensio and Lucentio\nmarvelling at how successfully Petruchio has tamed the shrew.\n\n##\nSources[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Sources\")]\n\nAlthough there is no direct literary source for the induction, the tale of a\ntinker being duped into believing he is a lord is one found in many literary\ntraditions.[1] Such a story is recorded in _[Arabian\nNights](/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights \"One Thousand and One Nights\")_\nwhere [Harun al-Rashid](/wiki/Harun_al-Rashid \"Harun al-Rashid\") plays the\nsame trick on a man he finds sleeping in an alley. Another is found in _De\nRebus Burgundicis_ by the Dutch historian Pontus de Huyter, where [Philip,\nDuke of Burgundy](/wiki/Philip_the_Good \"Philip the Good\"), after attending\nhis sister's wedding in Portugal, finds a drunken \"artisan\" whom he entertains\nwith a \"pleasant Comedie.\" _Arabian Nights_ was not translated into English\nuntil the mid 18th century, although Shakespeare may have known it by word of\nmouth. He could also have known the Duke of Burgundy story as, although _De\nRebus_ wasn't translated into French until 1600, and into English until 1607,\nthere is evidence the story existed in English in a [jest\nbook](/wiki/Jest_book \"Jest book\") (now lost) by [Richard\nEdwardes](/wiki/Richard_Edwardes \"Richard Edwardes\"), written in 1570.[2][3]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Katherine_and_Petruchio.jpg/220px-\nKatherine_and_Petruchio.jpg)](/wiki/File:Katherine_and_Petruchio.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Katherine_and_Petruchio.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Taming of the Shrew. Katherine and Petruchio_ by [James Dromgole\nLinton](/wiki/James_Dromgole_Linton \"James Dromgole Linton\") (_c._ 1890).\n\nRegarding the Petruchio/Katherina story, there are a variety of possible\ninfluences, but no one specific source. The basic elements of the narrative\nare present in tale 44 of the fourteenth-century Spanish book _[Libro de los\nejemplos del conde Lucanor y de Patronio](/wiki/Tales_of_Count_Lucanor \"Tales\nof Count Lucanor\")_ by [Don Juan Manuel](/wiki/Juan_Manuel,_Prince_of_Villena\n\"Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena\"), which tells of a young man who marries a\n\"very strong and fiery woman.\" The text had been translated into English by\nthe sixteenth century, but there is no evidence that Shakespeare drew on\nit.[4][5] The story of a headstrong woman tamed by a man was well known, and\nfound in numerous traditions. For example, according to _[The Canterbury\nTales](/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales \"The Canterbury Tales\")_ by [Geoffrey\nChaucer](/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer \"Geoffrey Chaucer\"), [Noah](/wiki/Noah\n\"Noah\")'s wife was such a woman ('\"Hastow nought herd,\" quod Nicholas,\n\"also/The sorwe of Noë with his felaschippe/That he had or he gat his wyf to\nschipe\"'; _[The Miller's Tale](/wiki/The_Miller%27s_Tale \"The Miller's\nTale\")_, l. 352–354), and it was common for her to be depicted in this manner\nin [mystery plays](/wiki/Mystery_play \"Mystery play\").[6][7] Historically,\nanother such woman was [Xanthippe](/wiki/Xanthippe \"Xanthippe\"),\n[Socrates](/wiki/Socrates \"Socrates\")' wife,[8] who is mentioned by Petruchio\nhimself (1.2.70). Such characters also occur throughout [medieval\nliterature](/wiki/Medieval_literature \"Medieval literature\"), in popular\n[farces](/wiki/Farce \"Farce\") both before and during Shakespeare's lifetime,\nand in [folklore](/wiki/Folklore \"Folklore\").[6][9]\n\nIn 1890, Alfred Tolman conjectured a possible literary source for the wager\nscene may have been [William Caxton](/wiki/William_Caxton \"William Caxton\")'s\n1484 translation of [Geoffroy IV de la Tour\nLandry](/wiki/Geoffroy_IV_de_la_Tour_Landry \"Geoffroy IV de la Tour Landry\")'s\n_[Livre pour l'enseignement de ses filles du Chevalier de La Tour\nLandry](/wiki/The_Book_of_the_Knight_of_the_Tower \"The Book of the Knight of\nthe Tower\")_ (1372). Written for his daughters as a guide on how to behave\nappropriately, de la Tour Landry includes \"a treatise on the domestic\neducation of women\" which features an anecdote in which three merchants make a\nwager as to which of their wives will prove the most obedient when called upon\nto jump into a basin of water. The episode sees the first two wives refuse to\nobey (as in the play), it ends at a banquet (as does the play) and it features\na speech regarding the 'correct' way for a husband to discipline his\nwife.[b][10] In 1959, John W. Shroeder conjectured that _Chevalier de La Tour\nLandry_ 's depiction of the [Queen Vastis](/wiki/Vashti \"Vashti\") story may\nalso have been an influence on Shakespeare.[11]\n\nIn 1964, Richard Hosley suggested the main source for the play may have been\nthe anonymous ballad \"A merry jeste of a shrewde and curst Wyfe, lapped in\nMorrelles Skin, for her good behauyour\".[12] The ballad tells the story of a\nmarriage in which the husband must tame his headstrong wife. Like _Shrew_ ,\nthe story features a family with two sisters, the younger of whom is seen as\nmild and desirable. However, in \"Merry Jest\", the older sister is obdurate not\nbecause it is simply her nature, but because she has been raised by her\nshrewish mother to seek mastery over men. Ultimately, the couple return to the\nfamily house, where the now tamed woman lectures her sister on the merits of\nbeing an obedient wife. The taming in this version is much more physical than\nin Shakespeare; the shrew is beaten with [birch rods](/wiki/Birching\n\"Birching\") until she bleeds, and is also wrapped in the flesh of a [plough\nhorse](/wiki/Draft_horse \"Draft horse\") (the Morrelle of the title).[c][13]\n\"Merry Jest\" was not unknown to earlier editors of the play, and had been\ndismissed as a source by A.R. Frey, [W.C. Hazlitt](/wiki/William_Carew_Hazlitt\n\"William Carew Hazlitt\"), R. Warwick Bond and [Frederick S.\nBoas](/wiki/Frederick_S._Boas \"Frederick S. Boas\").[14] Modern editors also\nexpress doubt as to Hosley's argument.[14][15]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Petruchio_ruins_dinner.jpg/220px-\nPetruchio_ruins_dinner.jpg)](/wiki/File:Petruchio_ruins_dinner.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Petruchio_ruins_dinner.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFr. Schwoerer illustration of Act 4, Scene 1 (Petruchio rejects the bridal\ndinner). Engraved by Georg Goldberg (_c._ 1850).\n\nIn 1966, [Jan Harold Brunvand](/wiki/Jan_Harold_Brunvand \"Jan Harold\nBrunvand\") argued that the main source for the play was not literary, but the\noral folktale tradition. He argued the Petruchio/Katherina story represents an\nexample of Type 901 ('Shrew-taming Complex') in the [Aarne–Thompson\nclassification system](/wiki/Aarne%E2%80%93Thompson_classification_system\n\"Aarne–Thompson classification system\"). Brunvand discovered 383 oral examples\nof Type 901 spread over thirty European countries, but he could find only 35\nliterary examples, leading him to conclude \"Shakespeare's taming plot, which\nhas not been traced successfully in its entirety to any known printed version,\nmust have come ultimately from oral tradition.\"[16][17] Most contemporary\ncritics accept Brunvand's findings.[18][19][20][21]\n\nA source for Shakespeare's sub-plot was first identified by Alfred Tolman in\n1890 as [Ludovico Ariosto](/wiki/Ludovico_Ariosto \"Ludovico Ariosto\")'s _I\nSuppositi_ , which was published in 1551. [George\nGascoigne](/wiki/George_Gascoigne \"George Gascoigne\")'s English\n[prose](/wiki/Prose \"Prose\") translation _Supposes_ was performed in 1566 and\nprinted in 1573.[22] In _I Suppositi_ , Erostrato (the equivalent of Lucentio)\nfalls in love with Polynesta (Bianca), daughter of Damon (Baptista). Erostrato\ndisguises himself as Dulipo (Tranio), a servant, whilst the real Dulipo\npretends to be Erostrato. Having done this, Erostrato is hired as a tutor for\nPolynesta. Meanwhile, Dulipo pretends to formally woo Polynesta so as to\nfrustrate the wooing of the aged Cleander (Gremio). Dulipo outbids Cleander,\nbut he promises far more than he can deliver, so he and Erostrato dupe a\ntravelling gentleman from [Siena](/wiki/Siena \"Siena\") into pretending to be\nErostrato's father, Philogano (Vincentio). However, when Polynesta is found to\nbe pregnant, Damon has Dulipo imprisoned (the real father is Erostrato). Soon\nthereafter, the real Philogano arrives, and all comes to a head. Erostrato\nreveals himself, and begs clemency for Dulipo. Damon realises that Polynesta\nis truly in love with Erostrato, and so forgives the subterfuge. Having been\nreleased from jail, Dulipo then discovers he is Cleander's son.[23] An\nadditional minor source is _[Mostellaria](/wiki/Mostellaria \"Mostellaria\")_ by\n[Plautus](/wiki/Plautus \"Plautus\"), from which Shakespeare probably took the\nnames of Tranio and Grumio.[24]\n\n## Date and\ntext[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Date and text\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/First_Quarto_title_page_of_The_Taming_of_the_Shrew.jpg/220px-\nFirst_Quarto_title_page_of_The_Taming_of_the_Shrew.jpg)](/wiki/File:First_Quarto_title_page_of_The_Taming_of_the_Shrew.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:First_Quarto_title_page_of_The_Taming_of_the_Shrew.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nTitle page from the first quarto, printed in 1631 as _A Wittie and Pleasant\nComedie Called The Taming of the Shrew_.\n\n###\nDate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Date\")]\n\nEfforts to establish the play's date of composition are complicated by its\nuncertain relationship with another\n[Elizabethan](/wiki/English_Renaissance_theatre \"English Renaissance theatre\")\nplay with an almost identical plot but different wording and character names,\n_A Pleasant Conceited Historie, called the taming of a Shrew_.[d][25] _The\nShrew_ 's exact relationship with _A Shrew_ is unknown. Different theories\nsuggest _A Shrew_ could be a [reported text](/wiki/Memorial_reconstruction\n\"Memorial reconstruction\") of a performance of _The Shrew_ , a source for _The\nShrew_ , an early draft (possibly reported) of _The Shrew_ , or an adaptation\nof _The Shrew_.[26] _A Shrew_ was entered in the [Stationers'\nRegister](/wiki/Stationers%27_Register \"Stationers' Register\") on 2 May\n1594,[27] suggesting that whatever the relationship between the two plays,\n_The Shrew_ was most likely written somewhere between 1590 (roughly when\nShakespeare arrived in London) and 1594 (registration of _A Shrew_).[28]\n\nHowever, it is possible to narrow the date further. A _[terminus ante\nquem](/wiki/Terminus_post_quem \"Terminus post quem\")_ for _A Shrew_ seems to\nbe August 1592, as a stage direction at 3.21 mentions \"Simon,\" which probably\nrefers to the actor Simon Jewell, who was buried on 21 August 1592.[29]\nFurthermore, _The Shrew_ must have been written earlier than 1593, as [Anthony\nChute](/wiki/Anthony_Chute \"Anthony Chute\")'s _Beauty Dishonoured, written\nunder the title of Shore 's wife_ (published in June 1593) contains the line\n\"He calls his Kate, and she must come and kiss him.\" This must refer to _The\nShrew_ , as there is no corresponding \"kissing scene\" in _A Shrew_.[30] There\nare also verbal similarities between both _Shrew_ plays and the anonymous play\n_[A Knack to Know a Knave](/wiki/A_Knack_To_Know_A_Knave \"A Knack To Know A\nKnave\")_ (first performed at [The Rose](/wiki/The_Rose_\\(theatre\\) \"The Rose\n\\(theatre\\)\") on 10 June 1592). _Knack_ features several passages common to\nboth _A Shrew_ and _The Shrew_ , but it also borrows several passages unique\nto _The Shrew_. This suggests _The Shrew_ was on stage prior to June 1592.[29]\n\nIn his 1982 edition of the play for [The Oxford\nShakespeare](/wiki/The_Oxford_Shakespeare \"The Oxford Shakespeare\"), H.J.\nOliver suggests the play was composed no later than 1592. He bases this on the\ntitle page of _A Shrew_ , which mentions the play had been performed \"sundry\ntimes\" by [Pembroke's Men](/wiki/Pembroke%27s_Men \"Pembroke's Men\"). When the\nLondon theatres were closed on 23 June 1592 due to an outbreak of\n[plague](/wiki/Plague_\\(disease\\) \"Plague \\(disease\\)\"), Pembroke's Men went\non a regional tour to [Bath](/wiki/Bath,_Somerset \"Bath, Somerset\") and\n[Ludlow](/wiki/Ludlow \"Ludlow\"). The tour was a financial failure, and the\ncompany returned to London on 28 September, financially ruined. Over the\ncourse of the next three years, four plays with their name on the title page\nwere published; [Christopher Marlowe](/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe \"Christopher\nMarlowe\")'s _[Edward II](/wiki/Edward_II_\\(play\\) \"Edward II \\(play\\)\")_\n(published in [quarto](/wiki/Quarto \"Quarto\") in July 1593), and Shakespeare's\n_[Titus Andronicus](/wiki/Titus_Andronicus \"Titus Andronicus\")_ (published in\nquarto in 1594), _[The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of\nYork](/wiki/Henry_VI,_Part_3 \"Henry VI, Part 3\")_ (published in\n[octavo](/wiki/Octavo \"Octavo\") in 1595) and _The Taming of a Shrew_\n(published in quarto in May 1594). Oliver says it is a \"natural assumption\"\nthat these publications were sold by members of Pembroke's Men who were broke\nafter the failed tour. Oliver assumes that _A Shrew_ is a reported version of\n_The Shrew_ , which means _The Shrew_ must have been in their possession when\nthey began their tour in June, as they didn't perform it upon returning to\nLondon in September, nor would they have taken possession of any new material\nat that time.[31]\n\nAnn Thompson considers _A Shrew_ to be a reported text in her 1984 and 2003\neditions of the play for the [New Cambridge\nShakespeare](/wiki/New_Cambridge_Shakespeare \"New Cambridge Shakespeare\"). She\nfocuses on the closure of the theatres on 23 June 1592, arguing that the play\nmust have been written prior to June 1592 for it to have given rise to _A\nShrew_. She cites the reference to \"Simon\" in _A Shrew_ , Anthony Chute's\nallusion to _The Shrew_ in _Beauty Dishonoured_ and the verbal similarities\nbetween _The Shrew_ and _A Knack to Know a Knave_ as supporting a date of\ncomposition prior to June 1592.[32] Stephen Roy Miller, in his 1998 edition of\n_A Shrew_ for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, agrees with the date of late\n1591/early 1592, as he believes _The Shrew_ preceded _A Shrew_ (although he\nrejects the reported text theory in favour of an adaptation/rewrite\ntheory).[33]\n\nKeir Elam, however, has argued for a _terminus post quem_ of 1591 for _The\nShrew_ , based on Shakespeare's probable use of two sources published that\nyear; [Abraham Ortelius](/wiki/Abraham_Ortelius \"Abraham Ortelius\")' map of\nItaly in the fourth edition of _[Theatrum Orbis\nTerrarum](/wiki/Theatrum_Orbis_Terrarum \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\")_ , and\n[John Florio](/wiki/John_Florio \"John Florio\")'s _Second Fruits_.[34] Firstly,\nShakespeare errs in putting Padua in [Lombardy](/wiki/Lombardy \"Lombardy\")\ninstead of [Veneto](/wiki/Veneto \"Veneto\"), probably because he used Ortelius'\nmap of Italy as a source, which has \"Lombardy\" written across the entirety of\nnorthern Italy. Secondly, Elam suggests that Shakespeare derived his Italian\nidioms and some of the dialogue from Florio's _Second Fruits_ , a bilingual\nintroduction to Italian language and culture. Elam argues that Lucentio's\nopening dialogue,\n\n> Tranio, since for the great desire I had  \n>  To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,  \n>  I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,  \n>  The pleasant garden of great Italy.  \n>  (1.1.1–4)\n\nis an example of Shakespeare's borrowing from Florio's dialogue between Peter\nand Stephan, who have just arrived in the north:\n\n> _PETER_  \n>  I purpose to stay a while, to view the fair Cities of Lombardy.  \n>  \n>  _STEPHAN_  \n>  Lombardy is the garden of the world.\n\nElam's arguments suggest _The Shrew_ must have been written by 1591, which\nplaces the date of composition around 1590–1591.[35]\n\n###\nText[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Text\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/First-page-first-\nfolio-taming-shrew.jpg/220px-First-page-first-folio-taming-\nshrew.jpg)](/wiki/File:First-page-first-folio-taming-shrew.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:First-page-first-folio-taming-shrew.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFirst page of _The Taming of the Shrew_ from the _[First\nFolio](/wiki/First_Folio \"First Folio\")_ (1623)\n\nThe 1594 quarto of _A Shrew_ was printed by [Peter\nShort](/wiki/Peter_Short_\\(printer\\) \"Peter Short \\(printer\\)\") for [Cuthbert\nBurbie](/wiki/Cuthbert_Burby \"Cuthbert Burby\").[36] It was republished in 1596\n(again by Short for Burbie),[36] and 1607 by [Valentine\nSimmes](/wiki/Valentine_Simmes \"Valentine Simmes\") for [Nicholas\nLing](/wiki/Nicholas_Ling \"Nicholas Ling\").[37] _The Shrew_ was not published\nuntil the _[First Folio](/wiki/First_Folio \"First Folio\")_ in 1623.[38] The\nonly quarto version of _The Shrew_ was printed by [William\nStansby](/wiki/William_Stansby \"William Stansby\") for [John\nSmethwick](/wiki/John_Smethwick \"John Smethwick\") in 1631 as _A Wittie and\nPleasant comedie called The Taming of the Shrew_ , based on the 1623 folio\ntext.[39] [W.W.

There are five main theories as to the nature of\nthis relationship:\n\n  1. The two plays are unrelated other than the fact that they are both based on another play which is now lost. This is the _Ur-Shrew_ theory (in reference to _[Ur-Hamlet](/wiki/Ur-Hamlet \"Ur-Hamlet\")_).[42]\n  2. _A Shrew_ is a reconstructed version of _The Shrew_ ; i.e. a [bad quarto](/wiki/Bad_quarto \"Bad quarto\"), an attempt by actors to reconstruct the original play from memory.[43]\n  3. Shakespeare used the previously existing _A Shrew_ , which he did not write, as a source for _The Shrew_.[44]\n  4. Both versions were legitimately written by Shakespeare himself; i.e. _A Shrew_ is an early draft of _The Shrew_.[45]\n  5. _A Shrew_ is an adaptation of _The Shrew_ by someone other than Shakespeare.[46]\n\nThe exact relationship between _The Shrew_ and _A Shrew_ is uncertain, but\nmany scholars consider _The Shrew_ the original, with _A Shrew_ derived from\nit;[47][48][49][50] as H.J. Oliver suggests, there are \"passages in [_A\nShrew_] [...] that make sense only if one knows the [Follio] version from\nwhich they must have been derived.\"[51]\n\nThe debate regarding the relationship between the two plays began in 1725,\nwhen [Alexander Pope](/wiki/Alexander_Pope \"Alexander Pope\") incorporated\nextracts from _A Shrew_ into _The Shrew_ in his [edition of Shakespeare's\nworks](/wiki/Alexander_Pope#Edition_of_Shakespeare's_works \"Alexander Pope\").\nIn _The Shrew_ , the Christopher Sly framework is only featured twice; at the\nopening of the play, and at the end of Act 1, Scene 1. However, in _A Shrew_ ,\nthe Sly framework reappears a further five times, including a scene which\ncomes after the final scene of the Petruchio/Katherina story. Pope added most\nof the Sly framework to _The Shrew_ , even though he acknowledged in his\npreface that he did not believe Shakespeare had written _A Shrew_.[52]\nSubsequent editors followed suit, adding some or all of the Sly framework to\ntheir versions of _The Shrew_ ; [Lewis Theobald](/wiki/Lewis_Theobald \"Lewis\nTheobald\") (1733), [Thomas Hanmer](/wiki/Sir_Thomas_Hanmer,_4th_Baronet \"Sir\nThomas Hanmer, 4th Baronet\") (1744), [William\nWarburton](/wiki/William_Warburton \"William Warburton\") (1747), [Samuel\nJohnson](/wiki/Samuel_Johnson \"Samuel Johnson\") and [George\nSteevens](/wiki/George_Steevens \"George Steevens\")\n([1765](/wiki/The_Plays_of_William_Shakespeare \"The Plays of William\nShakespeare\")) and [Edward Capell](/wiki/Edward_Capell \"Edward Capell\")\n(1768).[53] In his 1790 edition of _The Plays and Poems of William\nShakespeare_ , however, [Edmond Malone](/wiki/Edmond_Malone \"Edmond Malone\")\nremoved all _A Shrew_ extracts and returned the text to the 1623 _First Folio_\nversion.[54] By the end of the eighteenth century, the predominant theory had\ncome to be that _A Shrew_ was a non-Shakespearean source for _The Shrew_ , and\nhence to include extracts from it was to graft non-authorial material onto the\nplay.[55]\n\nThis theory prevailed until 1850, when Samuel Hickson compared the texts of\n_The Shrew_ and _A Shrew_ , concluding _The Shrew_ was the original, and _A\nShrew_ was derived from it. By comparing seven passages which are similar in\nboth plays, he concluded \"the original conception is invariably to be found\"\nin _The Shrew_. His explanation was that _A Shrew_ was written by [Christopher\nMarlowe](/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe \"Christopher Marlowe\"), with _The Shrew_ as\nhis template. He reached this conclusion primarily because _A Shrew_ features\nnumerous lines almost identical to lines in Marlowe's\n_[Tamburlaine](/wiki/Tamburlaine \"Tamburlaine\")_ and _[Dr.\nFaustus](/wiki/Doctor_Faustus_\\(play\\) \"Doctor Faustus \\(play\\)\")_.[56]\n\nIn 1926, building on Hickson's research, [Peter\nAlexander](/wiki/Peter_Alexander_\\(Shakespearean_scholar\\) \"Peter Alexander\n\\(Shakespearean scholar\\)\") first suggested the bad quarto theory. Alexander\nagreed with Hickson that _A Shrew_ was derived from _The Shrew_ , but he did\nnot agree that Marlowe wrote _A Shrew_. Instead he labelled _A Shrew_ a bad\nquarto. His main argument was that, primarily in the subplot of _A Shrew_ ,\ncharacters act without motivation, whereas such motivation is present in _The\nShrew_. Alexander believed this represents an example of a \"reporter\"\nforgetting details and becoming confused, which also explains why lines from\nother plays are used from time to time; to cover gaps which the reporter knows\nhave been left. He also argued the subplot in _The Shrew_ was closer to the\nplot of _I Suppositi_ /_Supposes_ than the subplot in _A Shrew_ , which he\nfelt indicated the subplot in _The Shrew_ must have been based directly on the\nsource, whereas the subplot in _A Shrew_ was a step removed.[57] In their 1928\nedition of the play for the New Shakespeare, [Arthur Quiller-\nCouch](/wiki/Arthur_Quiller-Couch \"Arthur Quiller-Couch\") and [John Dover\nWilson](/wiki/J._Dover_Wilson \"J. Dover Wilson\") supported Alexander's\nargument.[58] However, there has always been critical resistance to the\ntheory.[59][60][61][62][63][64][65]\n\nAn early scholar to find fault with Alexander's reasoning was [E.K.\nChambers](/wiki/E._K._Chambers \"E. K. Chambers\"), who reasserted the source\ntheory. Chambers, who supported Alexander's bad quarto theory regarding _[The\nFirst part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses of Yorke and\nLancaster](/wiki/Henry_VI,_Part_2 \"Henry VI, Part 2\")_ and _The True Tragedy\nof Richard Duke of Yorke_ , argued _A Shrew_ did not fit the pattern of a bad\nquarto; \"I am quite unable to believe that _A Shrew_ had any such origin. Its\ntextual relation to _The Shrew_ does not bear any analogy to that of other\n'bad Quartos' to the legitimate texts from which they were memorised. The\n[nomenclature](/wiki/Nomenclature \"Nomenclature\"), which at least a memoriser\ncan recall, is entirely different. The verbal parallels are limited to stray\nphrases, most frequent in the main plot, for which I believe Shakespeare\npicked them up from _A Shrew_.\"[66] He explained the relationship between _I\nSuppositi_ /_Supposes_ and the subplots by arguing the subplot in _The Shrew_\nwas based upon both the subplot in _A Shrew_ and the original version of the\nstory in Ariosto/Gascoigne.[67]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Carl_Gehrts_Petruccios_Hochzeit_1885.jpg/220px-\nCarl_Gehrts_Petruccios_Hochzeit_1885.jpg)](/wiki/File:Carl_Gehrts_Petruccios_Hochzeit_1885.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Carl_Gehrts_Petruccios_Hochzeit_1885.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Petruccio 's hochzeit_ by Carl Gehrts (1885).\n\nIn 1938, Leo Kirschbaum made a similar argument. In an article listing over\ntwenty examples of bad quartos, Kirschbaum did not include _A Shrew_ , which\nhe felt was too different from _The Shrew_ to come under the bad quarto\nbanner; \"despite protestations to the contrary, _The Taming of a Shrew_ does\nnot stand in relation to _The Shrew_ as _The True Tragedie_ , for example,\nstands in relation to _3 Henry VI_.\"[68] Writing in 1998, Stephen Roy Miller\noffers much the same opinion; \"the relation of the early quarto to the _Folio_\ntext is unlike other early quartos because the texts vary much more in\nplotting and dialogue [...] the differences between the texts are substantial\nand coherent enough to establish that there was deliberate revision in\nproducing one text out of the other; hence _A Shrew_ is not merely a poor\nreport (or 'bad quarto') of _The Shrew_.\"[69] Character names are changed,\nbasic plot points are altered (Kate has two sisters for example, not one), the\nplay is set in [Athens](/wiki/Athens \"Athens\") instead of Padua, the Sly\nframework forms a complete narrative, and entire speeches are completely\ndifferent, all of which suggests to Miller that the author of _A Shrew_\nthought they were working on something different from Shakespeare's play, not\nattempting to transcribe it for resale; \"underpinning the notion of a\n'Shakespearean bad quarto' is the assumption that the motive of whoever\ncompiled that text was to produce, differentially, a verbal replica of what\nappeared on stage.\"[70] Miller believes that Chambers and Kirschbaum\nsuccessfully illustrate _A Shrew_ does not fulfil this rubric.\n\nAlexander's theory continued to be challenged as the years went on. In 1942,\nR.A. Houk developed what came to be dubbed the _Ur-Shrew_ theory; both _A\nShrew_ and _The Shrew_ were based upon a third play, now lost.[71] In 1943,\nG.I. Duthie refined Houk's suggestion by arguing _A Shrew_ was a memorial\nreconstruction of _Ur-Shrew_ , a now lost early draft of _The Shrew_ ; \"_A\nShrew_ is substantially a memorially constructed text and is dependent upon an\nearly _Shrew_ play, now lost. _The Shrew_ is a reworking of this lost\nplay.\"[72] Hickson, who believed Marlowe to have written _A Shrew_ , had\nhinted at this theory in 1850; \"though I do not believe Shakspeare's play to\ncontain a line of any other writer, I think it extremely probable that we have\nit only in a revised form, and that, consequently, the play which Marlowe\nimitated might not necessarily have been that fund of life and humour that we\nfind it now.\"[73] Hickson is here arguing that Marlowe's _A Shrew_ is not\nbased upon the version of _The Shrew_ found in the _First Folio_ , but on\nanother version of the play. Duthie argues this other version was a\nShakespearean early draft of _The Shrew_ ; _A Shrew_ constitutes a reported\ntext of a now lost early draft.[74]\n\nAlexander returned to the debate in 1969, re-presenting his bad quarto theory.\nIn particular, he concentrated on the various complications and\ninconsistencies in the subplot of _A Shrew_ , which had been used by Houk and\nDuthie as evidence for an _Ur-Shrew_ , to argue that the reporter of _A Shrew_\nattempted to recreate the complex subplot from _The Shrew_ but got confused;\n\"the compiler of _A Shrew_ while trying to follow the subplot of _The Shrew_\ngave it up as too complicated to reproduce, and fell back on love scenes in\nwhich he substituted for the maneuvers of the disguised Lucentio and Hortensio\nextracts from _Tamburlaine_ and _Faustus_ , with which the lovers woo their\nladies.\"[75]\n\nAfter little further discussion of the issue in the 1970s, the 1980s saw the\npublication of three scholarly editions of _The Shrew_ , all of which re-\naddressed the question of the relationship between the two plays; [Brian\nMorris](/wiki/Brian_Morris,_Baron_Morris_of_Castle_Morris \"Brian Morris, Baron\nMorris of Castle Morris\")' 1981 edition for the second series of the [Arden\nShakespeare](/wiki/Arden_Shakespeare \"Arden Shakespeare\"), H.J. Oliver's 1982\nedition for the Oxford Shakespeare and Ann Thompson's 1984 edition for the New\nCambridge Shakespeare. Morris summarised the scholarly position in 1981 as one\nin which no clear-cut answers could be found; \"unless new, external evidence\ncomes to light, the relationship between _The Shrew_ and _A Shrew_ can never\nbe decided beyond a peradventure. It will always be a balance of\nprobabilities, shifting as new arguments and opinions are added to the scales.\nNevertheless, in the present century, the movement has unquestionably been\ntowards an acceptance of the Bad Quarto theory, and this can now be accepted\nas at least the current orthodoxy.\"[76] Morris himself,[47] and Thompson,[50]\nsupported the bad quarto theory, with Oliver tentatively arguing for Duthie's\nbad quarto/early draft/_Ur-Shrew_ theory.[48]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Washington_Allston%2C_American_-\n_Scene_from_Shakespeare%27s_%22The_Taming_of_the_Shrew%22_%28Katharina_and_Petruchio%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-\nWashington_Allston%2C_American_-\n_Scene_from_Shakespeare%27s_%22The_Taming_of_the_Shrew%22_%28Katharina_and_Petruchio%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)](/wiki/File:Washington_Allston,_American_-\n_Scene_from_Shakespeare%27s_%22The_Taming_of_the_Shrew%22_\\(Katharina_and_Petruchio\\)_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Washington_Allston,_American_-\n_Scene_from_Shakespeare%27s_%22The_Taming_of_the_Shrew%22_\\(Katharina_and_Petruchio\\)_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n_Scene from Shakespeare 's The Taming of the Shrew_ by [Washington\nAllston](/wiki/Washington_Allston \"Washington Allston\") (1809).\n\nPerhaps the most extensive examination of the question came in 1998 in Stephen\nRoy Miller's edition of _A Shrew_ for the New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early\nQuartos series. Miller agrees with most modern scholars that _A Shrew_ is\nderived from _The Shrew_ , but he does not believes it to be a bad quarto.\nInstead, he argues it is an adaptation by someone other than Shakespeare.[46]\nMiller believes Alexander's suggestion in 1969 that the reporter became\nconfused is unlikely, and instead suggests an adapter at work; \"the most\neconomic explanation of indebtedness is that whoever compiled _A Shrew_\nborrowed the lines from Shakespeare's _The Shrew_ , or a version of it, and\nadapted them.\"[77] Part of Miller's evidence relates to Gremio, who has no\ncounterpart in _A Shrew_. In _The Shrew_ , after the wedding, Gremio expresses\ndoubts as to whether or not Petruchio will be able to tame Katherina. In _A\nShrew_ , these lines are extended and split between Polidor (the equivalent of\nHortensio) and Phylema (Bianca). As Gremio _does_ have a counterpart in _I\nSuppositi_ , Miller concludes that \"to argue the priority of _A Shrew_ in this\ncase would mean arguing that Shakespeare took the negative hints from the\nspeeches of Polidor and Phylema and gave them to a character he resurrected\nfrom _Supposes_. This is a less economical argument than to suggest that the\ncompiler of _A Shrew_ , dismissing Gremio, simply shared his doubts among the\ncharacters available.\"[78] He argues there is even evidence in the play that\nthe compiler knew he was working within a specific literary tradition; \"as\nwith his partial change of character names, the compiler seems to wish to\nproduce dialogue much like his models, but not the same. For him, adaptation\nincludes exact quotation, imitation and incorporation of his own additions.\nThis seems to define his personal style, and his aim seems to be to produce\nhis own version, presumably intended that it should be tuned more towards the\npopular era than _The Shrew_.\"[79]\n\nAs had Alexander, Houk and Duthie, Miller believes the key to the debate is to\nbe found in the subplot, as it is here where the two plays differ most. He\npoints out that the subplot in _The Shrew_ is based on \"the classical style of\n[Latin](/wiki/Latin_literature \"Latin literature\") comedy with an intricate\nplot involving deception, often kept in motion by a comic servant.\" The\nsubplot in _A Shrew_ , however, which features an extra sister and addresses\nthe issue of marrying above and below one's class, \"has many elements more\nassociated with the romantic style of comedy popular in London in the\n1590s.\"[80] Miller cites plays such as [Robert\nGreene](/wiki/Robert_Greene_\\(dramatist\\) \"Robert Greene \\(dramatist\\)\")'s\n_[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay](/wiki/Friar_Bacon_and_Friar_Bungay \"Friar\nBacon and Friar Bungay\")_ and _[Fair Em](/wiki/Fair_Em \"Fair Em\")_ as evidence\nof the popularity of such plays. He points to the fact that in _The Shrew_ ,\nthere is only eleven lines of romance between Lucentio and Bianca, but in _A\nShrew_ , there is an entire scene between Kate's two sisters and their lovers.\nThis, he argues, is evidence of an adaptation rather than a faulty report;\n\n> while it is difficult to know the motivation of the adapter, we can reckon\n> that from his point of view an early staging of _The Shrew_ might have\n> revealed an overly wrought play from a writer trying to establish himself\n> but challenging too far the current ideas of popular comedy. _The Shrew_ is\n> long and complicated. It has three plots, the subplots being in the swift\n> Latin or Italianate style with several disguises. Its language is at first\n> stuffed with difficult Italian quotations, but its dialogue must often sound\n> plain when compared to Marlowe's thunder or Greene's romance, the mouth-\n> filling lines and images that on other afternoons were drawing crowds. An\n> adapter might well have seen his role as that of a 'play doctor' improving\n> _The Shrew_ – while cutting it – by stuffing it with the sort of material\n> currently in demand in popular romantic comedies.[81]\n\nMiller believes the compiler \"appears to have wished to make the play shorter,\nmore of a romantic comedy full of wooing and glamorous\n[rhetoric](/wiki/Rhetoric \"Rhetoric\"), and to add more obvious, broad\ncomedy.\"[82]\n\n#### Hortensio\nproblem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Hortensio problem\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Sly_Induction.jpg/150px-\nSly_Induction.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sly_Induction.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sly_Induction.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[H.C. Selous](/wiki/Henry_Courtney_Selous \"Henry Courtney Selous\")'\nillustration of Sly and the Hostess; from _The Plays of William Shakespeare:\nThe Comedies_ , edited by [Charles Cowden Clarke](/wiki/Charles_Cowden_Clarke\n\"Charles Cowden Clarke\") and [Mary Cowden Clarke](/wiki/Mary_Cowden_Clarke\n\"Mary Cowden Clarke\") (1830).\n\nH.J. Oliver argues the version of the play in the 1623 _First Folio_ was\nlikely copied not from a [prompt book](/wiki/Prompt_book \"Prompt book\") or\ntranscript, but from the author's own [foul papers](/wiki/Foul_papers \"Foul\npapers\"), which he believes showed signs of revision by\nShakespeare.[83][40][74] These revisions, Oliver says, relate primarily to the\ncharacter of Hortensio, and suggest that in an original version of the play,\nnow lost, Hortensio was not a suitor to Bianca, but simply an old friend of\nPetruchio. When Shakespeare rewrote the play so that Hortensio became a suitor\nin disguise (Litio), many of his lines were either omitted or given to Tranio\n(disguised as Lucentio).[84]\n\nOliver cites several scenes in the play where Hortensio (or his absence)\ncauses problems. For example, in Act 2, Scene 1, Tranio (as Lucentio) and\nGremio bid for Bianca, but Hortensio, who everyone is aware is also a suitor,\nis never mentioned. In Act 3, Scene 1, Lucentio (as Cambio) tells Bianca \"we\nmight beguile the old [Pantalowne](/wiki/Pantalone \"Pantalone\")\" (l.36), yet\nsays nothing of Hortensio's attempts to woo her, instead implying his only\nrival is Gremio. In Act 3, Scene 2, Tranio suddenly becomes an old friend of\nPetruchio, knowing his mannerisms and explaining his tardiness prior to the\nwedding. However, up to this point, Petruchio's only acquaintance in Padua has\nbeen Hortensio. In Act 4, Scene 3, Hortensio tells Vincentio that Lucentio has\nmarried Bianca. However, as far as Hortensio should be concerned, Lucentio has\ndenounced Bianca, because in Act 4, Scene 2, Tranio (disguised as Lucentio)\nagreed with Hortensio that neither of them would pursue Bianca, and as such,\nhis knowledge of the marriage of who he supposes to be Lucentio and Bianca\nmakes no sense. From this, Oliver concludes that an original version of the\nplay existed in which Hortensio was simply a friend of Petruchio's, and had no\ninvolvement in the Bianca subplot, but wishing to complicate things,\nShakespeare rewrote the play, introducing the Litio disguise, and giving some\nof Hortensio's discarded lines to Tranio, but not fully correcting everything\nto fit the presence of a new suitor.[84]\n\nThis is important in Duthie's theory of an _Ur-Shrew_ insofar as he argues it\nis the original version of _The Shrew_ upon which _A Shrew_ is based, not the\nversion which appears in the 1623 _First Folio_.[85] As Oliver argues, \"_A\nShrew_ is a report of an earlier, Shakespearian, form of _The Shrew_ in which\nHortensio was not disguised as Litio.\"[86] Oliver suggests that when\nPembroke's Men left London in June 1592, they had in their possession a now\nlost early draft of the play. Upon returning to London, they published _A\nShrew_ in 1594, some time after which Shakespeare rewrote his original play\ninto the form seen in the _First Folio_.[87]\n\nDuthie's arguments were never fully accepted at the time, as critics tended to\nlook on the relationship between the two plays as an either-or situation; _A\nShrew_ is _either_ a reported text _or_ an early draft.[88] In more recent\nscholarship, however, the possibility that a text could be both has been shown\nto be critically viable. For example, in his 2003 Oxford Shakespeare edition\nof _2 Henry VI_ , Roger Warren makes the same argument for _The First Part of\nthe Contention_.[89] Randall Martin reaches the same conclusion regarding _The\nTrue Tragedy of Richard Duke of Yorke_ in his 2001 Oxford Shakespeare edition\nof _3 Henry VI_.[90] This lends support to the theory that _A Shrew_ could be\nboth a reported text and an early draft.\n\n####\nControversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Controversy\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/ShrewPetruchio.jpg/220px-\nShrewPetruchio.jpg)](/wiki/File:ShrewPetruchio.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ShrewPetruchio.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nKevin Black in his \"wedding outfit\" in the 2003 Carmel Shakespeare Festival\nproduction.\n\n_The Taming of the Shrew_ has been the subject of critical controversy. Dana\nAspinall writes \"Since its first appearance, some time between 1588 and 1594,\n_Shrew_ has elicited a panoply of heartily supportive, ethically uneasy, or\naltogether disgusted responses to its rough-and-tumble treatment of the\n'taming' of the 'curst shrew' Katherina, and obviously, of all potentially\nunruly wives.\"[91] Phyllis Rackin argues that \"seen in the context of current\nanxieties, desires and beliefs, Shakespeare's play seems to prefigure the most\noppressive modern assumptions about women and to validate those assumptions as\ntimeless truths.\"[92] [Stevie Davies](/wiki/Stevie_Davies \"Stevie Davies\")\nsays that responses to _Shrew_ have been \"dominated by feelings of unease and\nembarrassment, accompanied by the desire to prove that Shakespeare cannot have\nmeant what he seems to be saying; and that therefore he cannot really be\nsaying it.\"[93] Philippa Kelly asks:\n\n> Do we simply add our voices to those of critical disapproval, seeing _Shrew_\n> as at best an 'early Shakespeare', the socially provocative effort of a\n> dramatist who was learning to flex his muscles? Or as an item of social\n> archaeology that we have long ago abandoned? Or do we 'rescue' it from\n> offensive male smugness? Or make an appeal to the slippery category of\n> '[irony](/wiki/Irony \"Irony\")'?[94]\n\nSome scholars argue that even in Shakespeare's day the play must have been\ncontroversial, due to the changing nature of gender politics. [Marjorie\nGarber](/wiki/Marjorie_Garber \"Marjorie Garber\"), for example, suggests\nShakespeare created the Induction so the audience wouldn't react badly to the\nmisogyny in the Petruchio/Katherina story; he was, in effect, defending\nhimself against charges of [sexism](/wiki/Sexism \"Sexism\").[95] G.R. Hibbard\nargues that during the period in which the play was written, [arranged\nmarriages](/wiki/Arranged_marriage \"Arranged marriage\") were beginning to give\nway to newer, more romantically informed unions, and thus people's views on\nwomen's position in society, and their relationships with men, were in a state\nof flux. As such, audiences may not have been as predisposed to tolerate the\nharsh treatment of Katherina as is often thought.[96]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Petruchio_rejects_the_gowns.jpg/220px-\nPetruchio_rejects_the_gowns.jpg)](/wiki/File:Petruchio_rejects_the_gowns.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Petruchio_rejects_the_gowns.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMid-19th century print of Act 4, Scene 3 (Petruchio rejects the tailor's gowns\nfor Katherina)\n\nEvidence of at least some initial societal discomfort with _The Shrew_ is,\nperhaps, to be found in the fact that [John\nFletcher](/wiki/John_Fletcher_\\(playwright\\) \"John Fletcher \\(playwright\\)\"),\nShakespeare's successor as house playwright for the [King's\nMen](/wiki/King%27s_Men_\\(playing_company\\) \"King's Men \\(playing company\\)\"),\nwrote _[The Woman's Prize](/wiki/The_Woman%27s_Prize \"The Woman's Prize\"), or\nThe Tamer Tamed_ as a sequel to Shakespeare's play. Written _c._ 1611,[97] the\nplay tells the story of Petruchio's remarriage after Katherina's death. In a\nmirror of the original, his new wife attempts (successfully) to tame him –\nthus the tamer becomes the tamed. Although Fletcher's sequel is often\ndownplayed as merely a farce, some critics acknowledge the more serious\nimplications of such a reaction. Lynda Boose, for example, writes, \"Fletcher's\nresponse may in itself reflect the kind of discomfort that _Shrew_ has\ncharacteristically provoked in men and why its many revisions since 1594 have\nrepeatedly contrived ways of softening the edges.\"[98]\n\nWith the rise of the [feminist movement](/wiki/Feminist_movement \"Feminist\nmovement\") in the twentieth century, reactions to the play have tended to\nbecome more divergent. For some critics, \"Kate's taming was no longer as funny\nas it had been [...] her domination became, in [George Bernard\nShaw](/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw \"George Bernard Shaw\")'s words 'altogether\ndisgusting to modern sensibility'.\"[99] Addressing the relationship between _A\nShrew_ and _The Shrew_ from a political perspective, for example, Leah S.\nMarcus very much believes the play to be what it seems. She argues _A Shrew_\nis an earlier version of _The Shrew_ , but acknowledges that most scholars\nreject the idea that _A Shrew_ was written by Shakespeare. She believes one of\nthe reasons for this is because _A Shrew_ \"hedges the play's\n[patriarchal](/wiki/Patriarchy \"Patriarchy\") message with numerous qualifiers\nthat do not exist in\" _The Shrew_.[100] She calls _A Shrew_ a more\n\"progressive\" text than _The Shrew_ , and argues that scholars tend to dismiss\nthe idea that _A Shrew_ is Shakespearean because \"the women are not as\nsatisfactorily tamed as they are in _The Shrew_.\"[101] She also points out\nthat if _A Shrew_ is an early draft, it suggests Shakespeare \"may have\nincreased rather than decreased the patriarchal violence of his materials\",\nsomething which, she believes, scholars find difficult to accept.[102]\n\nHowever, others see the play as an example of a pre-[feminist](/wiki/Feminism\n\"Feminism\") condemnation of patriarchal domination and an argument for modern-\nday \"women's lib\". For example, director [Conall\nMorrison](/w/index.php?title=Conall_Morrison&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Conall\nMorrison \\(page does not exist\\)\"), wrote in 2008:\n\n> I find it gobsmacking that some people see the play as\n> [misogynistic](/wiki/Misogyny \"Misogyny\").

According\nto H.J. Oliver, \"it has become orthodoxy to claim to find in the Induction the\nsame 'theme' as is to be found in both the Bianca and the Katherine-Petruchio\nplots of the main play, and to take it for granted that identity of theme is a\nmerit and 'justifies' the introduction of Sly.\"[107] For example, Geoffrey\nBullough argues the three plots \"are all linked in idea because all contain\ndiscussion of the relations of the sexes in marriage.\"[108] Richard Hosley\nsuggests the three plots form a unified whole insofar as they all deal with\n\"assumptions about identity and assumptions about personality.\"[109] Oliver,\nhowever, argues that \"the Sly Induction does not so much announce the theme of\nthe enclosed stories as establish their _tone_.\"[110]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Christopher_Sly_%28Orchardson%29.jpg/220px-\nChristopher_Sly_%28Orchardson%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Christopher_Sly_\\(Orchardson\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Christopher_Sly_\\(Orchardson\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[William Quiller Orchardson](/wiki/William_Quiller_Orchardson \"William Quiller\nOrchardson\")'s illustration of Sly and the Lord, engraved by Charles William\nSharpe; from the _Imperial Edition of The Works of Shakespere_ , edited by\n[Charles Knight](/wiki/Charles_Knight_\\(publisher\\) \"Charles Knight\n\\(publisher\\)\") (1876).\n\nThis is important in terms of determining the seriousness of Katherina's final\nspeech. Marjorie Garber writes of the Induction, \"the frame performs the\nimportant task of distancing the later action, and of insuring a lightness of\ntone – significant in light of the real abuse to which Kate is subjected by\nPetruchio.\"[95] Oliver argues the Induction is used to remove the audience\nfrom the world of the enclosed plot – to place the Sly story on the same level\nof reality as the audience, and the Katherina/Petruchio story on a different\nlevel of reality. This, he argues, is done to ensure the audience does not\ntake the play literally, that it sees the Katherina/Petruchio story as a\nfarce:\n\n> the phenomenon of theatrical illusion is itself being laughed at; and the\n> play within the play makes Sly drowsy and probably soon sends him to sleep.\n> Are we to let _that_ play preach morality to us or look in it for social or\n> intellectual substance? The drunken tinker may be believed in as one\n> believes in any realistically presented character; but we cannot 'believe'\n> in something that is not even mildly interesting to him. The play within the\n> play has been presented only after all the preliminaries have encouraged us\n> to take it as a farce.[111]\n\nOliver argues that \"the main purpose of the Induction was to set the tone for\nthe play within the play – in particular, to present the story of Kate and her\nsister as none-too-serious comedy put on to divert a drunken tinker\".[112] He\nsuggests that if the Induction is removed from a production of the play (as it\nvery often is), a fundamental part of the structure has been lost.[113]\nSpeaking of Jonathan Miller's _BBC Television Shakespeare_ adaptation of 1980,\nwhich omitted the Induction, [Stanley Wells](/wiki/Stanley_Wells \"Stanley\nWells\") wrote \"to omit the Christopher Sly episodes is to suppress one of\nShakespeare's most volatile lesser characters, to jettison most of the play's\nbest poetry, and to strip it of an entire dramatic dimension.\"[114]\n\nRegarding the importance of the Induction, [Jonathan Bate](/wiki/Jonathan_Bate\n\"Jonathan Bate\") and Eric Rasmussen argue \"the Sly framework establishes a\n[self-referential](/wiki/Self-reference \"Self-reference\") theatricality in\nwhich the status of the shrew-play _as_ a play is enforced.\"[115] [Graham\nHolderness](/wiki/Graham_Holderness \"Graham Holderness\") argues \"the play in\nits received entirety does not propose any simple or unitary view of sexual\npolitics: it contains a crudely reactionary [dogma](/wiki/Dogma \"Dogma\") of\nmasculine supremacy, but it also works on that [ideology](/wiki/Ideology\n\"Ideology\") to force its expression into self-contradiction. The means by\nwhich this self-interrogation is accomplished is that complex theatrical\ndevice of the Sly-framework [...] without the [metadramatic](/wiki/Metatheatre\n\"Metatheatre\") potentialities of the Sly-framework, any production of _Shrew_\nis thrown much more passively at the mercy of the director's artistic and\npolitical ideology.\"[116] Coppélia Kahn suggests \"the transformation of\nChristopher Sly from drunken lout to noble lord, a transformation only\ntemporary and skin-deep, suggests that Kate's switch from independence may\nalso be deceptive and prepares us for the irony of the\n_[dénouement](/wiki/Dramatic_structure#Dénouement,_resolution,_revelation_or_catastrophe\n\"Dramatic structure\")_.\"[117] The Induction serves to undercut charges of\nmisogyny – the play within the play is a farce, it is not supposed to be taken\nseriously by the audience, as it is not taken seriously by Sly. As such,\nquestions of the seriousness of what happens within it are rendered\nirrelevant.[113]\n\n###\nLanguage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Language\")]\n\nLanguage itself is a major theme in the play, especially in the taming\nprocess, where mastery of language becomes paramount. Katherina is initially\ndescribed as a shrew because of her harsh language to those around her; \"from\nthe outset of the play, Katherine's threat to male authority is posed through\nlanguage: it is perceived by others as such and is linked to a claim larger\nthan shrewishness – [witchcraft](/wiki/Witchcraft \"Witchcraft\") – through the\nconstant allusions to Katherine's kinship with the [devil](/wiki/Devil\n\"Devil\").\"[118] For example, after Katherina rebukes Hortensio and Gremio in\nAct 1, Scene 1, Hortensio replies with \"From all such devils, good Lord\ndeliver us!\" (l.66). Even Katherina's own father refers to her as \"thou\nhilding of a devilish spirit\" (2.1.26). Petruchio, however, attempts to tame\nher – and thus her language – with rhetoric that specifically undermines her\ntempestuous nature;\n\n> Say that she rail, why then I'll tell her plain  \n>  She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.  \n>  Say that she frown, I'll say that she looks as clear  \n>  As morning roses newly washed with dew.  \n>  Say she be mute and will not speak a word,  \n>  Then I'll commend her [volubility](/wiki/Fluency \"Fluency\")  \n>  And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.  \n>  If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,  \n>  As though she bid me stay by her a week.  \n>  If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day  \n>  When I shall ask the [banns](/wiki/Banns_of_marriage \"Banns of marriage\"),\n> and when be marrièd.  \n>  (2.1.169–179)\n\nHere Petruchio is specifically attacking the very function of Katherina's\nlanguage, vowing that no matter what she says, he will purposely misinterpret\nit, thus undermining the basis of the [linguistic\nsign](/wiki/Sign_\\(semiotics\\) \"Sign \\(semiotics\\)\"), and disrupting the\nrelationship between signifier and signified. In this sense, Margaret Jane\nKidnie argues this scene demonstrates the \"slipperiness of language.\"[119]\n\nApart from undermining her language, Petruchio also uses language to\n[objectify](/wiki/Ownership \"Ownership\") her. For example, in Act 3, Scene 2,\nPetruchio explains to all present that Katherina is now literally his\nproperty:\n\n> She is my goods, my [chattels](/wiki/Personal_property \"Personal property\"),\n> she is my house,  \n>  My household stuff, my field, my barn,  \n>  My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing.  \n>  (ll.232–234)\n\nIn discussing Petruchio's objectification of Katherina, Tita French Baumlin\nfocuses on his puns on her name. By referring to her as a \"cake\" and a \"cat\"\n(2.1.185–195), he objectifies her in a more subtle manner than saying she\nbelongs to him.[120] A further aspect of Petruchio's taming rhetoric is the\nrepeated comparison of Katherina to animals. In particular, he is prone to\ncomparing her to a [hawk](/wiki/Hawk \"Hawk\") (2.1.8 and 4.1.177–183), often\nemploying an overarching hunting metaphor; \"My falcon now is sharp and passing\nempty,/And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged\" (4.1.177–178).\nKatherina, however, appropriates this method herself, leading to a trading of\ninsults rife with animal imagery in Act 2, Scene 1 (ll.207–232), where she\ncompares Petruchio to a turtle and a crab.\n\nLanguage itself has thus become a battleground. However, it is Petruchio who\nseemingly emerges as the victor. In his house, after Petruchio has dismissed\nthe haberdasher, Katherina exclaims\n\n> Why sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,  \n>  And speak I will. I am no child, no babe;  \n>  Your betters have endured me say my mind,  \n>  And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.  \n>  My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,  \n>  Or else my heart concealing it will break,  \n>  And rather than it shall, I will be free  \n>  Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.  \n>  (4.3.74–80)\n\nKatherina is here declaring her independence of language; no matter what\nPetruchio may do, she will always be free to speak her mind. However, only\none-hundred lines later, the following exchange occurs;\n\n> _PETRUCHIO_  \n>  Let's see, I think 'tis now some seven o'clock.  \n>  And well we may come there by dinner-time.  \n>  \n>  _KATHERINA_  \n>  I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,  \n>  And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.  \n>  \n>  _PETRUCHIO_  \n>  It shall be seven ere I go to horse.  \n>  Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,  \n>  You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone,  \n>  I will not go today; and ere I do,  \n>  It shall be what o'clock I say it is.  \n>  (4.3.184–192)\n\nKidnie says of this scene, \"the language game has suddenly changed and the\nstakes have been raised. Whereas before he seemed to mishear or misunderstand\nher words, Petruchio now overtly tests his wife's subjection by demanding that\nshe concede to his views even when they are demonstrably unreasonable. The\nlesson is that Petruchio has the absolute authority to rename their\nworld.\"[121] Katherina is free to say whatever she wishes, as long she agrees\nwith Petruchio. His apparent victory in the 'language game' is seen in Act 4,\nScene 5, when Katherina is made to switch the words \"moon\" and \"sun\", and she\nconcedes that she will agree with whatever Petruchio says, no matter how\nabsurd:\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Act_IV%2C_scene_5_%28Ibbetson%29.jpg/150px-\nAct_IV%2C_scene_5_%28Ibbetson%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Act_IV,_scene_5_\\(Ibbetson\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Act_IV,_scene_5_\\(Ibbetson\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Julius Caesar Ibbetson](/wiki/Julius_Caesar_Ibbetson \"Julius Caesar\nIbbetson\") illustration of Act 4, Scene 5 (the \"sun and moon\" conversation)\nfrom _[The Boydell Shakespeare Prints](/wiki/Boydell_Shakespeare_Gallery\n\"Boydell Shakespeare Gallery\")_ ; engraved by [Isaac\nTaylor](/wiki/Isaac_Taylor_\\(1759%E2%80%931829\\) \"Isaac Taylor \\(1759–1829\\)\")\n(1803).\n\n> And be it the moon, or sun, or what you please;  \n>  And if you please to call it a [rush-candle](/wiki/Rushlight \"Rushlight\"),  \n>  Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me  \n>  ...  \n>  But sun it is not, when you say it is not,  \n>  And the moon changes even as your mind:  \n>  What you will have it named, even that it is,  \n>  And so it shall be so for Katherine.  \n>  (ll.12–15; ll.19–22)\n\nOf this scene, Kidnie argues \"what he 'says' must take priority over what\nKatherina 'knows'.\"[122] From this point, Katherina's language changes from\nher earlier [vernacular](/wiki/Vernacular \"Vernacular\"); instead of defying\nPetruchio and his words, she has apparently succumbed to his rhetoric and\naccepted that she will use _his_ language instead of her own – both Katherina\nand her language have, seemingly, been tamed.\n\nThe important role of language, however, is not confined to the taming plot.\nFor example, in a [psychoanalytic](/wiki/Psychoanalysis \"Psychoanalysis\")\nreading of the play, Joel Fineman suggests there is a distinction made between\nmale and female language, further subcategorising the latter into good and\nbad, epitomised by Bianca and Katherina respectively.[123] Language is also\nimportant in relation to the Induction. Here, Sly speaks in\n[prose](/wiki/Prose \"Prose\") until he begins to accept his new role as lord,\nat which point he switches to [blank verse](/wiki/Blank_verse \"Blank verse\")\nand adopts the [royal we](/wiki/Royal_we \"Royal we\").[124] Language is also\nimportant in relation to Tranio and Lucentio, who appear on stage speaking a\nhighly artificial style of blank verse full of [classical](/wiki/Classics\n\"Classics\") and [mythological](/wiki/Classical_antiquity \"Classical\nantiquity\") allusions and elaborate [metaphors](/wiki/Metaphor \"Metaphor\") and\n[similes](/wiki/Simile \"Simile\"), thus immediately setting them aside from the\nmore straightforward language of the Induction, and alerting the audience to\nthe fact that they are now in an entirely different\n_[milieu](/wiki/Social_environment \"Social environment\")_.[125]\n\n###\nThemes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Themes\")]\n\n#### Female\nsubmissiveness[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Female submissiveness\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/TamingShrew01.JPG/150px-\nTamingShrew01.JPG)](/wiki/File:TamingShrew01.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:TamingShrew01.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Arthur Rackham](/wiki/Arthur_Rackham \"Arthur Rackham\") illustration of Act 5,\nScene 2 (Katherina is the only wife to respond to her husband); from _[Tales\nfrom Shakespeare](/wiki/Tales_from_Shakespeare \"Tales from Shakespeare\")_ ,\nedited by [Charles Lamb](/wiki/Charles_Lamb \"Charles Lamb\") and [Mary\nLamb](/wiki/Mary_Lamb \"Mary Lamb\") (1890).\n\nIn productions of the play, it is often the interpretation of Katherina's\nfinal speech (the longest speech in the play) that defines the tone of the\nentire production, such is the importance of this speech and what it says, or\nseems to say, about female submission:\n\n>  \n>\n>\n> Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,  \n>  And dart not scornful glances from those eyes  \n>  To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.  \n>  It blots thy beauty, as frosts do bite the meads,  \n>  Confounds thy fame, as whirlwinds shake fair buds,  \n>  And in no sense is meet or amiable.  \n>  A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,  \n>  Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,  \n>  And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty  \n>  Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.  \n>  Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,  \n>  Thy head, thy sovereign: one that cares for thee,  \n>  And for thy maintenance; commits his body  \n>  To painful labour both by sea and land,  \n>  To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,  \n>  Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,  \n>  And craves no other tribute at thy hands  \n>  But love, fair looks, and true obedience –  \n>  Too little payment for so great a debt.  \n>  Such duty as the subject owes the prince,  \n>  Even such a woman oweth to her husband;  \n>  And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,  \n>  And not obedient to his honest will,  \n>  What is she but a foul contending rebel  \n>  And graceless traitor to her loving lord?  \n>  I am ashamed that women are so simple  \n>  To offer war where they should kneel for peace;  \n>  Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,  \n>  When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.  \n>  Why are our bodies soft, and weak, and smooth,  \n>  Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,  \n>  But that our soft conditions, and our hearts,  \n>  Should well agree with our external parts?  \n>  Come, come, you froward and unable worms!  \n>  My mind hath been as big as one of yours,  \n>  My heart as great, my reason haply more,  \n>  To bandy word for word and frown for frown;  \n>  But now I see our lances are but straws,  \n>  Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,  \n>  That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.  \n>  Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,  \n>  And place your hands below your husband's foot;  \n>  In token of which duty, if he please,  \n>  My hand is ready, may it do him ease.  \n>  (5.2.136–179)  \n>\n\nTraditionally, many critics have taken the speech literally. Writing in 1943,\nfor example, G.I. Duthie argued \"what Shakespeare emphasises here is the\nfoolishness of trying to destroy order.\"[126] However, in a modern [western\nsociety](/wiki/Western_world \"Western world\"), holding relatively\n[egalitarian](/wiki/Egalitarianism \"Egalitarianism\") views on gender,[99] such\nan interpretation presents a dilemma, as according to said interpretation the\nplay seemingly celebrates female subjugation.[91][92][93][94]\n\nCritically, four main theories have emerged in response to Katherina's speech;\n\n  1. It is sincere; Petruchio has successfully tamed her.[126][127]\n  2. It is sincere, but not because Petruchio has tamed her. Instead, she has fallen in love with him and accepted her role as his wife.[128][129]\n  3. It is ironic; she is being sarcastic, pretending to have been tamed when in reality she has completely duped Petruchio into thinking he has tamed her.[130][131]\n  4. It should not be read seriously or ironically; it is part of the farcical nature of the play-within-the-play.[132][133]\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw wrote in 1897 that \"no man with any decency of feeling can\nsit it out in the company of a woman without being extremely ashamed of the\nlord-of-creation moral implied in the wager and the speech put into the\nwoman's own mouth.\"[134] Katherina is seen as having been successfully tamed,\nand having come to accept her newly submissive role to such an extent that she\nadvocates that role for others, the final speech rationalises, according to\nDuthie, in both a political and [sociological](/wiki/Sociology \"Sociology\")\nsense, the submission of wives to husbands.[126]\n\nActress [Meryl Streep](/wiki/Meryl_Streep \"Meryl Streep\"), who played\nKatherina in 1978 at the [Shakespeare in the Park\nfestival](/wiki/Shakespeare_in_the_Park_festivals \"Shakespeare in the Park\nfestivals\"), says of the play, \"really what matters is that they have an\nincredible passion and love; it's not something that Katherina admits to right\naway, but it does provide the source of her change.\"[135] Similarly, John C.\nBean sees the speech as the final stage in the process of Katherina's change\nof heart towards Petruchio; \"if we can appreciate the\n[liberal](/wiki/Liberalism \"Liberalism\") element in Kate's last speech – the\nspeech that strikes modern sensibilities as advocating male tyranny – we can\nperhaps see that Kate is tamed not in the automatic manner of [behavioural\npsychology](/wiki/Behaviorism \"Behaviorism\") but in the spontaneous manner of\nthe later romantic comedies where characters lose themselves and emerge, as if\nfrom a dream, liberated into the bonds of love.\"[128]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Taming_of_the_shrew.jpg/220px-\nTaming_of_the_shrew.jpg)](/wiki/File:Taming_of_the_shrew.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Taming_of_the_shrew.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Taming of the Shrew_ by [Augustus Egg](/wiki/Augustus_Egg \"Augustus Egg\")\n(1860).\n\nPerhaps the most common interpretation in the modern era is that the speech is\nironic; Katherina has not been tamed at all, she has merely duped Petruchio\ninto thinking she has. Two especially well known examples of this\ninterpretation are seen in the two major feature film adaptations of the play;\n[Sam Taylor](/wiki/Sam_Taylor_\\(director\\) \"Sam Taylor \\(director\\)\")'s [1929\nversion](/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_\\(1929_film\\) \"The Taming of the Shrew\n\\(1929 film\\)\") and [Franco Zeffirelli](/wiki/Franco_Zeffirelli \"Franco\nZeffirelli\")'s [1967 version](/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_\\(1967_film\\) \"The\nTaming of the Shrew \\(1967 film\\)\"). In Taylor's film, Katherina, played by\n[Mary Pickford](/wiki/Mary_Pickford \"Mary Pickford\"), winks at Bianca during\nthe speech, indicating she does not mean a word of what she is saying.[136] In\nZeffirelli's film, Katherina, played by [Elizabeth\nTaylor](/wiki/Elizabeth_Taylor \"Elizabeth Taylor\"), delivers the speech as\nthough it were her own idea, and the submission aspect is reversed by her\nending the speech and leaving the room, causing Petruchio to have to run after\nher.[137] Phyllis Rackin is an example of a scholar who reads the speech\nironically, especially in how it deals with gender. She points out that\nseveral lines in the speech focus on the woman's body, but in the [Elizabethan\ntheatre](/wiki/English_Renaissance_theatre \"English Renaissance theatre\"), the\nrole would have been played by a young boy, thus rendering any evocation of\nthe female form as ironic. Reading the play as a satire of gender roles, she\nsees the speech as the culmination of this process.[130] Along similar lines,\nPhilippa Kelly says \"the body of the boy actor in Shakespeare's time would\nhave created a sexual indeterminacy that would have undermined the patriarchal\nnarrative, so that the taming is only _apparently_ so. And in declaring\nwomen's passivity so extensively and performing it centre-stage, Kate might be\nseen to take on a kind of agency that rebukes the feminine codes of silence\nand obedience which she so expressly advocates.\"[131] Similarly, Coppélia Kahn\nargues the speech is really about how little Katherina has been tamed; \"she\nsteals the scene from her husband, who has held the stage throughout the play,\nand reveals that he has failed to tame her in the sense he set out to. He has\ngained her outward compliance in the form of a public display, while her\nspirit remains mischievously free.\"[138]\n\nIn relation to this interpretation, [William Empson](/wiki/William_Empson\n\"William Empson\") suggests that Katherina was originally performed by an adult\nmale actor rather than a young boy. He argues that the play indicates on\nseveral occasions that Katherina is physically strong, and even capable of\nover-powering Petruchio. For example, this is demonstrated off-stage when the\nhorse falls on her as she is riding to Petruchio's home, and she is able to\nlift it off herself, and later when she throws Petruchio off a servant he is\nbeating. Empson argues that the point is not that Katherina is, as a woman,\nweak, but that she is not well cast in the role in life which she finds\nherself having to play. The end of the play then offers blatant irony when a\nstrong male actor, dressed as a woman, lectures women on how to play their\nparts.[139]\n\nThe fourth school of thought is that the play is a farce, and hence the speech\nshould not be read seriously or ironically. For example, Robert B. Heilman\nargues that \"the whole wager scene falls essentially within the realm of\nfarce: the responses are largely mechanical, as is their symmetry. Kate's\nfinal long speech on the obligations and fitting style of wives we can think\nof as a more or less automatic statement – that is, the kind appropriate to\nfarce – of a generally held doctrine.\"[140] He further makes his case by\npositing:\n\n> there are two arguments against [an ironic interpretation]. One is that a\n> careful reading of the lines will show that most of them have to be taken\n> literally; only the last seven or eight lines can be read with ironic\n> overtones [...] The second is that some forty lines of straight irony would\n> be too much to be borne; it would be inconsistent with the\n> straightforwardness of most of the play, and it would really turn Kate back\n> into a hidden shrew whose new technique was sarcastic indirection,\n> sidemouthing at the audience, while her not very intelligent husband,\n> bamboozled, cheered her on.[141]\n\nAnother way in which to read the speech (and the play) as farcical is to focus\non the Induction. H.J. Oliver, for example, emphasising the importance of the\nInduction, writes \"the play within the play has been presented only after all\nthe preliminaries have encouraged us to take it as a farce. We have been\nwarned.\"[111] Of Katherina's speech, he argues:\n\n> this lecture by Kate on the wife's duty to submit is the only fitting climax\n> _to the farce_ – and for that very reason it cannot logically be taken\n> seriously, orthodox though the views expressed may be [...] attempting to\n> take the last scene as a continuation of the realistic portrayal of\n> character leads some modern producers to have it played as a kind of private\n> joke between Petruchio and Kate – or even have Petruchio imply that by now\n> he is thoroughly ashamed of himself. It does not, cannot, work. The play has\n> changed key: it has modulated back from something like realistic social\n> comedy to the other, 'broader' kind of entertainment that was foretold by\n> the Induction.[133]\n\n#### Gender\npolitics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Gender politics\")]\n\nThe issue of gender politics is an important theme in _The Taming of the\nShrew_. In a letter to the _[Pall Mall Gazette](/wiki/Pall_Mall_Gazette \"Pall\nMall Gazette\")_ , George Bernard Shaw famously called the play \"one vile\ninsult to womanhood and manhood from the first word to the last.\"[142] A\ncontemporary critic, Emily Detmer, points out that in the late 16th and early\n17th century, laws curtailing husbands' use of violence in disciplining their\nwives were becoming more commonplace; \"the same culture that still \"felt good\"\nabout dunking [scolds](/wiki/Common_scold \"Common scold\"), whipping whores, or\nburning witches was becoming increasingly sensitive about husbands beating\ntheir wives.\"[143] Detmer argues:\n\n> the vigor of public discourse on wife-beating exemplifies a culture at work\n> reformulating permissible and impermissible means for husbands to maintain\n> control over the politics of the family, without, however, questioning that\n> goal. This new boundary was built on notions of class and civil behaviour.\n> Shakespeare's _The Taming of the Shrew_ acts as a comedic roadmap for\n> reconfiguring these emergent modes of \"skillful\" and civilised dominance for\n> _gentle_ men, that is, for subordinating a wife without resorting to the\n> \"common\" man's brute strength.[144]\n\nPetruchio's answer is to psychologically tame Katherina, a method not frowned\nupon by society; \"the play signals a shift towards a \"modern\" way of managing\nthe subordination of wives by legitimatising domination as long as it is not\nphysical.\"[145] Detmer argues \"Shakespeare's \"shrew\" is tamed in a manner that\nwould have made the wife-beating reformers proud; Petruchio's taming \"policy\"\ndramatises how abstention from physical violence works better. The play\nencourages its audience not only to pay close attention to Petruchio's method\nbut also to judge and enjoy the method's permissibility because of the absence\nof blows and the harmonious outcome.\"[146]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Tameing_a_Shrew%3B_or%2C_Petruchio%27s_Patent_Family_Bedstead%2C_Gags_%26_Thumscrews.png/150px-\nTameing_a_Shrew%3B_or%2C_Petruchio%27s_Patent_Family_Bedstead%2C_Gags_%26_Thumscrews.png)](/wiki/File:Tameing_a_Shrew;_or,_Petruchio%27s_Patent_Family_Bedstead,_Gags_%26_Thumscrews.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tameing_a_Shrew;_or,_Petruchio%27s_Patent_Family_Bedstead,_Gags_%26_Thumscrews.png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n'Williams' cartoon from _Caricature_ magazine; \"Tameing a Shrew; or,\nPetruchio's Patent Family Bedstead, Gags & Thumscrews\" (1815).\n\nHowever, Detmer is critical of scholars who defend Shakespeare for depicting\nmale dominance in a less brutal fashion than many of his contemporaries. For\nexample, although not specifically mentioned by Detmer, Michael West writes\n\"the play's attitude was characteristically Elizabethan and was expressed more\nhumanly by Shakespeare than by some of his sources.\"[147] Detmer goes on to\nread the play in light of modern psychological theories regarding women's\nresponses to [domestic violence](/wiki/Domestic_violence \"Domestic violence\"),\nand argues that Katherina develops [Stockholm\nsyndrome](/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome \"Stockholm syndrome\"):\n\n> a model of domestic violence that includes tactics other than physical\n> violence gives readers a way in which to understand Kate's romanticised\n> surrender at the end of the play as something other than consensual, as, in\n> fact, a typical response to abuse [...] Like a victim of the Stockholm\n> syndrome, she denies her own feelings in order to bond with her abuser. Her\n> surrender and obedience signify her emotional bondage as a survival\n> strategy; she aims to please because her life depends upon it. Knowing how\n> the Stockholm syndrome works can help us to see that whatever\n> \"[subjectivity](/wiki/Subjectivity \"Subjectivity\")\" might be achieved is\n> created out of domination and a coercive bonding.[148]\n\nIn a [Marxist](/wiki/Marxist_literary_criticism \"Marxist literary criticism\")\nreading of the play, Natasha Korda argues that, although Petruchio is not\ncharacterised as a violent man, he still embodies sixteenth century notions\nregarding the subjugation and objectification of women. Shrew taming stories\nexisted prior to Shakespeare's play, and in such stories, \"the object of the\ntale was simply to put the shrew to work, to restore her (frequently through\nsome gruesome form of punishment) to her proper productive place within the\nhousehold economy.\"[149] Petruchio does not do this, but Korda argues he still\nworks to curtail the activities of the woman; \"Kate [is] not a reluctant\nproducer, but rather an avid and sophisticated consumer of market goods [...]\nPetruchio's taming strategy is accordingly aimed not at his wife's productive\ncapacity – not once does he ask Kate to brew, bake, wash, card, or spin – but\nat her consumption. He seeks to educate her in her role as a consumer.\"[150]\nShe believes that even though Petruchio does not use force to tame Katherina,\nhis actions are still an endorsement of patriarchy; he makes her his property\nand tames her into accepting a patriarchal economic worldview. Vital in this\nreading is Katherina's final speech, which Korda argues \"inaugurates a new\ngendered division of labour, according to which husbands \"labour both by sea\nand land\" while their wives luxuriate at home [...] In erasing the status of\n[housework](/wiki/Homemaking \"Homemaking\") as work, separate-sphere ideology\nrenders the [housewife](/wiki/Housewife \"Housewife\") perpetually indebted to\nher husband [...] _The Taming of the Shrew_ marks the emergence of the\nideological separation of feminine and masculine spheres of labour.\"[151]\n\nIn a different reading of how gender politics are handled in the play, David\nBeauregard reads the relationship between Katherina and Petruchio in\ntraditional [Aristotelian](/wiki/Aristotelianism \"Aristotelianism\") terms.\nPetruchio, as the architect of [virtue](/wiki/Virtue \"Virtue\")\n(_[Politics](/wiki/Politics_\\(Aristotle\\) \"Politics \\(Aristotle\\)\")_ , 1.13),\nbrings Kate into harmony with her nature by developing her \"new-built virtue\nand obedience\", (5.2.118), and she, in turn, brings to Petruchio in her person\nall the Aristotelian components of happiness – wealth and good fortune,\nvirtue, friendship and love, the promise of domestic peace and quiet\n(_[Nicomachean Ethics](/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics \"Nicomachean Ethics\")_ ,\n1.7–8). The virtue of obedience at the center of Kate's final speech is not\nwhat Aristotle describes as the despotic rule of master over slave, but rather\nthe statesman's rule over a free and equal person (_Politics_ , 1.3, 12–13).\nRecognising the evil of despotic domination, the play holds up in inverse form\nKate's shrewishness, the feminine form of the will to dominance, as an evil\nthat obstructs natural fulfillment and destroys marital happiness.[152]\n\n####\nCruelty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Cruelty\")]\n\nAnother theme in the play is cruelty. Alexander Leggatt states:\n\n> the taming of Katherina is not just a lesson, but a game – a test of skill\n> and a source of pleasure. The roughness is, at bottom, part of the fun: such\n> is the peculiar psychology of sport that one is willing to endure aching\n> muscles and risk the occasional broken limb for the sake of the challenge.\n> The sports most often recalled throughout the play are [blood\n> sports](/wiki/Blood_sport \"Blood sport\"), hunting and\n> [hawking](/wiki/Falconry \"Falconry\"), thus invoking in the audience the\n> state of mind in which cruelty and violence are acceptable, even exciting,\n> because their scope is limited by tacit agreement and they are made the\n> occasion for a display of skill.[153]\n\nAnn Thompson argues that \"the fact that in the folktale versions the shrew-\ntaming story always comes to its climax when the husbands wager on their\nwives' obedience must have been partly responsible for the large number of\nreferences to sporting, gaming and gambling throughout the play. These\nmetaphors can help to make Petruchio's cruelty acceptable by making it seem\nlimited and conventionalised.\"[154] Marvin Bennet Krims argues that \"the play\nleans heavily on representations of cruelty for its comedic effect.\"[155] He\nbelieves cruelty permeates the entire play, including the Induction, arguing\nthe Sly frame, with the Lord's spiteful practical joke, prepares the audience\nfor a play willing to treat cruelty as a comedic matter.[156] He suggests that\ncruelty is a more important theme than gender, arguing that \"the aggression\nrepresented in _Taming_ can be read as having less to do with gender and more\nto do with hate, with the text thereby becoming a comic representation of the\ngeneral problem of human cruelty and victimisation.\"[157]\n\nDirector [Michael Bogdanov](/wiki/Michael_Bogdanov \"Michael Bogdanov\"), who\ndirected the play in 1978, considers that \"Shakespeare was a feminist\":\n\n> Shakespeare shows women totally abused – like animals – bartered to the\n> highest bidder. He shows women used as commodities, not allowed to choose\n> for themselves. In _The Taming of the Shrew_ you get that extraordinary\n> scene between Baptista, Grumio, and Tranio, where they are vying with each\n> other to see who can offer most for Bianca, who is described as 'the prize'.\n> It is a toss of the coin to see which way she will go: to the old man with a\n> certain amount of money, or to the young man, who is boasting that he's got\n> so many ships. She could end up with the old impotent fool, or the young\n> 'eligible' man: what sort of life is that to look forward to? There is no\n> question of it, [Shakespeare's] sympathy is with the women, and his purpose,\n> to expose the cruelty of a society that allows these things to happen.[158]\n\n####\nMoney[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Taming_of_the_Shrew&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Money\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/John_Drew_as_Petruchio.jpg/150px-\nJohn_Drew_as_Petruchio.jpg)](/wiki/File:John_Drew_as_Petruchio.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:John_Drew_as_Petruchio.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[John Drew](/wiki/John_Drew,_Jr. \"John Drew, Jr.\") as Petruchio in [Augustin\nDaly](/wiki/Augustin_Daly \"Augustin Daly\")'s 1887 production at Daly's\nTheatre, New York.\n\nThe motivation of money is another theme. When speaking of whether or not\nsomeone may ever want to marry Katherina, Hortensio says \"Though it pass your\npatience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why man, there be good fellows\nin the world, and a man could light on them, would take her with all faults\nand money enough\" (1.1.125–128). In the scene that follows Petruchio says:\n\n> If thou know  \n>  One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife-  \n>  As wealth is burden of my wooing dance-  \n>  Be she as foul as was [Florentius](/wiki/Confessio_Amantis#The_tales\n> \"Confessio Amantis\")' love,  \n>  As old as\n> [Sibyl](/wiki/Cumaean_Sibyl#Stories_recounted_in_Ovid's_Metamorphoses\n> \"Cumaean Sibyl\"), and as curst and shrewd  \n>  As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,  \n>  She moves me not.  \n>  (1.2.65–71)\n\nA few lines later Grumio says, \"Why give him gold enough and marry him to a\npuppet or an [aglet](/wiki/Aglet \"Aglet\")-baby, or an old trot with ne're a\ntooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses.\nWhy, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal\" (1.2.77–80).

The first wife insisted on knowing the reason for the command; she received several blows from her husband's fist. The second wife flatly refused to obey; she was thoroughly beaten with a staff. The wife of the third merchant received the same warning as the rest, but the intended trial was postponed until after dinner. During the meal this wife was asked to put salt upon the table. Because of a similarity between the two expressions in French, she understood her husband to command her to leap upon the table.
