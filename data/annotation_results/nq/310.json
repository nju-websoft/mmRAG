He has a close and loving family: parents Emily and\nJack, and sister Nora, as well as three best friends: Nick and Leah, who he\nhas known most of his life, and newcomer Abby. One day, Leah informs Simon\nabout an online confession of a closeted gay student at their high school,\nknown only by the pseudonym \"Blue\". Simon then proceeds to reach out to him\nunder his own alias, \"Jacques\". They confide very personal details, and soon\nhe and Blue form a genuine connection. However, their emails are discovered by\nanother student, Martin, who is infatuated with Simon’s friend Abby. After\nlearning his secret, Martin blackmails Simon and forces him to help him win\nover Abby.\n\nSimon begins to suspect that one of his classmates, Bram, is Blue. At a\nhalloween party, he attempts to connect with Bram, however Simon walks in on\nhim and a female student making out. Simon gets drunk at the party, and Leah\nwalks him home and sleeps over. She speaks vaguely about feeling she is fated\nto love one person very intensely, and Simon believes she is referring to\ntheir friend, Nick.\n\nLater, Simon meets with Abby and Martin at a local diner after Simon convinces\nthem to run lines together for an upcoming musical. While there, Simon bonds\nwith their server, a classmate named Lyle, and believes that Lyle is Blue.\nMartin and Abby start to grow closer. Later that night, Simon comes out to\nAbby, and is encouraged when she reacts positively. At a school football game,\nhe runs into Lyle and tries to ask him out. Before he has the chance to, Simon\nfinds out Lyle has a romantic interest in Abby.\n\nAn upset Simon tells a pestering Martin to either \"Go big or go home\" with\nAbby. During the national anthem at the football game, Martin, dressed as the\nschool mascot, seizes the microphone and declares his feelings for Abby in\nfront of the entire stadium, but she admits she does not feel the same way. A\nhumiliated Martin becomes the subject of intense ridicule.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Martin impulsively posts the screenshots of Blue and Simon's\nemails on the school gossip site, outing Simon by name. His younger sister\nNora reports the abuse and the emails are taken down, but not before they are\nseen by most of the students. Nora tries to comfort her brother, but Simon\nshuts her out, and does not return his friends’ frantic texts. On Christmas\nmorning, Simon comes out to his parents, much to their surprise but\nacceptance. Later, Blue tells Simon that the two should stop speaking, and he\ncloses his email account.\n\nAfter Christmas, Nick and Abby discover that Simon was manipulating Abby to\ntry and get her to date Martin, and angrily confront him about the lies he has\nbeen telling. Leah confesses she was in love with Simon, not Nick, and is\nupset he came out to Abby first.\n\nAt school, Simon tries to determine Blue's identity to no avail. In the\ncafeteria, Simon and another openly gay student, Ethan, are publicly\nhumiliated. Ethan and Simon bond about the difficulties they have faced coming\nout. After school, Martin tries to apologize to Simon, who angrily rejects the\nattempt.\n\nAfter his parents reach out and comfort him, Simon apologizes to Leah,\nadmitting he is in love with Blue. Leah helps him make amends with Nick and\nAbby, who are now a couple. Simon then posts a confession seeking out Blue and\nasking him to come forward. Waiting for Blue at the school carnival, Simon\nrides the Ferris wheel, drawing a large crowd of peers, until he runs out of\ntickets. Martin then comes forward and, to make amends, buys him one last\nride. It is revealed then that Bram is Blue; the kiss Simon saw with the\nfemale student was a drunk misunderstanding. Simon and Bram ride the Ferris\nwheel together and kiss.\n\nSimon’s life gradually returns to normal as Simon reconnects with his family\nand friends, and begins a relationship with Bram.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love,_Simon&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Nick Robinson](/wiki/Nick_Robinson_\\(American_actor\\) \"Nick Robinson \\(American actor\\)\") as Simon Spier \n    * Bryson Pitts as 10-year-old Simon Spier\n    * Nye Reynolds as 5-year-old Simon Spier\n  * [Josh Duhamel](/wiki/Josh_Duhamel \"Josh Duhamel\") as Jack Spier, Simon's father\n  * [Jennifer Garner](/wiki/Jennifer_Garner \"Jennifer Garner\") as Emily Spier, Simon's mother\n  * [Katherine Langford](/wiki/Katherine_Langford \"Katherine Langford\") as Leah Burke, one of Simon's best friends\n  * [Alexandra Shipp](/wiki/Alexandra_Shipp \"Alexandra Shipp\") as Abby Suso, one of Simon's best friends\n  * [Jorge Lendeborg Jr.](/wiki/Jorge_Lendeborg_Jr. \"Jorge Lendeborg Jr.\") as Nick Eisner, one of Simon's best friends\n  * [Keiynan Lonsdale](/wiki/Keiynan_Lonsdale \"Keiynan Lonsdale\") as Abraham \"Bram\" Greenfeld, one of Simon's classmates\n  * [Miles Heizer](/wiki/Miles_Heizer \"Miles Heizer\") as Cal Price, one of Simon's friends and classmates\n  * [Logan Miller](/wiki/Logan_Miller \"Logan Miller\") as Martin Addison, one of Simon's classmates who blackmails him\n  * [Talitha Bateman](/wiki/Talitha_Bateman \"Talitha Bateman\") as Nora Spier, Simon's sister \n    * Skye Mowbray as 6-year-old Nora Spier\n  * [Tony Hale](/wiki/Tony_Hale \"Tony Hale\") as Mr. Worth, the vice principal of the school Simon attends\n  * Natasha Rothwell as Ms. Albright, Simon's drama teacher\n  * Drew Starkey as Garrett Laughlin, one of Simon's classmates\n  * Clark Moore as Ethan, one of Simon's classmates who is openly gay\n  * [Joey Pollari](/wiki/Joey_Pollari \"Joey Pollari\") as Lyle, a flirty server at a local diner\n  * [Mackenzie Lintz](/wiki/Mackenzie_Lintz \"Mackenzie Lintz\") as Taylor, one of Simon's classmates\n\n## Production[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love,_Simon&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\nbegan on March 6, 2017 in [Atlanta, Georgia](/wiki/Atlanta \"Atlanta\").[14]\nFilming officially ended on April 23, 2017.[15]\n\n## Soundtrack[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love,_Simon&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Soundtrack\")]\n\nLove, Simon (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)  \n---  \n[Soundtrack album](/wiki/Soundtrack_album \"Soundtrack album\") by [Various\nArtists](/wiki/Various_Artists \"Various Artists\")  \nReleased | March 16, 2018  \n[Genre](/wiki/Music_genre \"Music genre\") | [Soundtrack](/wiki/Soundtrack \"Soundtrack\")  \nLength | TBA  \n[Label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\") | [Sony Music Entertainment](/wiki/RCA_Records \"RCA Records\")  \n[Singles](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\") from _Love, Simon\n(Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)_  \n  \n  1. \"[Love Lies](/wiki/Love_Lies_\\(Khalid_and_Normani_song\\) \"Love Lies \\(Khalid and Normani song\\)\")\"  \nReleased: 14 February 2018\n\n  \n  \nThe soundtrack of the film includes music by\n[Bleachers](/wiki/Bleachers_\\(band\\) \"Bleachers \\(band\\)\"), [Troye\nSivan](/wiki/Troye_Sivan \"Troye Sivan\"), [Amy Shark](/wiki/Amy_Shark \"Amy\nShark\"), [Brenton Wood](/wiki/Brenton_Wood \"Brenton Wood\"), [The\n1975](/wiki/The_1975 \"The 1975\"), [Normani](/wiki/Normani \"Normani\") and\n[Khalid](/wiki/Khalid_\\(singer\\) \"Khalid \\(singer\\)\"), among others.
