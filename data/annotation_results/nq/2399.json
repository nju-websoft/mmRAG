Each base edge and apex\nform a triangle, called a _lateral face_. It is a [conic solid](/wiki/Cone\n\"Cone\") with polygonal base. A pyramid with an _n_ -sided base has _n_ \\+ 1\nvertices, _n_ \\+ 1 faces, and 2 _n_ edges. All pyramids are [self-\ndual](/wiki/Self-dual_polyhedron \"Self-dual polyhedron\").\n\nA **right pyramid** has its apex directly above the [centroid](/wiki/Centroid\n\"Centroid\") of its base. Nonright pyramids are called **oblique pyramids**. A\n**regular pyramid** has a [regular polygon](/wiki/Regular_polygon \"Regular\npolygon\") base and is usually implied to be a _right pyramid_.[1][2]\n\nWhen unspecified, a pyramid is usually assumed to be a _regular_ [square\npyramid](/wiki/Square_pyramid \"Square pyramid\"), like the physical\n[pyramid](/wiki/Pyramid \"Pyramid\") structures. A [triangle](/wiki/Triangle\n\"Triangle\")-based pyramid is more often called a\n[tetrahedron](/wiki/Tetrahedron \"Tetrahedron\").\n\nAmong oblique pyramids, like [acute and obtuse\ntriangles](/wiki/Acute_and_obtuse_triangles \"Acute and obtuse triangles\"), a\npyramid can be called _acute_ if its apex is above the interior of the base\nand _obtuse_ if its apex is above the exterior of the base. A **right-angled\npyramid** has its apex above an edge or vertex of the base. In a tetrahedron\nthese qualifiers change based on which face is considered the base.\n\nPyramids are a subclass of the [prismatoids](/wiki/Prismatoid \"Prismatoid\").\nPyramids can be doubled into [bipyramids](/wiki/Bipyramid \"Bipyramid\") by\nadding a second offset point on the other side of the base plane.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Right pyramids with a regular base\n    * 1.1 Right Star pyramids\n  * 2 Right pyramids with an irregular base\n  * 3 Volume\n  * 4 Surface area\n  * 5 n-dimensional pyramids\n    * 5.1 Polyhedral pyramid\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Right pyramids with a regular\nbase[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pyramid_\\(geometry\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Right pyramids with a regular base\")]\n\nA right pyramid with a regular base has isosceles triangle sides, with\nsymmetry is C _n_ v or [1,_n_], with order 2 _n_.

A join operation\ncreates a new edge between all pairs of vertices of the two joined figures.\n\nThe **trigonal** or **triangular pyramid** with all [equilateral\ntriangles](/wiki/Equilateral_triangle \"Equilateral triangle\") faces becomes\nthe [regular](/wiki/Regular_polyhedron \"Regular polyhedron\")\n[tetrahedron](/wiki/Tetrahedron \"Tetrahedron\"), one of the [Platonic\nsolids](/wiki/Platonic_solid \"Platonic solid\"). A lower symmetry case of the\n**triangular pyramid** is C3v, which has an equilateral triangle base, and 3\nidentical isosceles triangle sides. The square and pentagonal pyramids can\nalso be composed of regular convex polygons, in which case they are [Johnson\nsolids](/wiki/Johnson_solid \"Johnson solid\").\n\nIf all edges of a square pyramid (or any convex polyhedron) are\n[tangent](/wiki/Tangent \"Tangent\") to a [sphere](/wiki/Sphere \"Sphere\") so\nthat the average position of the tangential points are at the center of the\nsphere, then the pyramid is said to be\n[canonical](/wiki/Dual_polyhedron#Canonical_duals \"Dual polyhedron\"), and it\nforms half of a regular [octahedron](/wiki/Octahedron \"Octahedron\").\n\nPyramids with a hexagonal or higher base must be composed of isosceles\ntriangles; a hexagonal pyramid with equilateral triangles would be a\ncompletely flat figure, and a heptagonal or higher would have the triangles\nnot meet at all.\n\n[show][Regular pyramids](/wiki/Regular_pyramid \"Regular pyramid\")  \n---  \n[Triangular](/wiki/Tetrahedron \"Tetrahedron\") | [Square](/wiki/Square_pyramid \"Square pyramid\") | [Pentagonal](/wiki/Pentagonal_pyramid \"Pentagonal pyramid\") | [Hexagonal](/wiki/Hexagonal_pyramid \"Hexagonal pyramid\") | Heptagonal | Octagonal...  \nRegular | Equilateral | Isosceles  \n[![Tetrahedron.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Tetrahedron.svg/50px-Tetrahedron.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Tetrahedron.svg) | [![Square pyramid.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Square_pyramid.png/70px-Square_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:Square_pyramid.png) | [![Pentagonal pyramid.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Pentagonal_pyramid.png/70px-Pentagonal_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:Pentagonal_pyramid.png) | [![Hexagonal pyramid.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Hexagonal_pyramid.png/50px-Hexagonal_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:Hexagonal_pyramid.png) | [![Heptagonal pyramid1.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Heptagonal_pyramid1.png/70px-Heptagonal_pyramid1.png)](/wiki/File:Heptagonal_pyramid1.png) | [![Octagonal pyramid1.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Octagonal_pyramid1.png/70px-Octagonal_pyramid1.png)](/wiki/File:Octagonal_pyramid1.png)  \n[![Spherical trigonal pyramid.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Spherical_trigonal_pyramid.png/50px-Spherical_trigonal_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:Spherical_trigonal_pyramid.png) | [![Spherical square pyramid.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Spherical_square_pyramid.png/50px-Spherical_square_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:Spherical_square_pyramid.png) | [![Spherical pentagonal pyramid.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Spherical_pentagonal_pyramid.png/50px-Spherical_pentagonal_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:Spherical_pentagonal_pyramid.png) | [![Spherical hexagonal pyramid.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Spherical_hexagonal_pyramid.png/50px-Spherical_hexagonal_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:Spherical_hexagonal_pyramid.png) | [![Spherical heptagonal pyramid.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Spherical_heptagonal_pyramid.png/50px-Spherical_heptagonal_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:Spherical_heptagonal_pyramid.png) | [![Spherical octagonal pyramid.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Spherical_octagonal_pyramid.png/50px-Spherical_octagonal_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:Spherical_octagonal_pyramid.png)  \n  \n### Right Star\npyramids[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pyramid_\\(geometry\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Right Star pyramids\")]\n\nRight pyramids with [regular star polygon](/wiki/Regular_star_polygon \"Regular\nstar polygon\") bases are called **star pyramids**.[3] For example, the\npentagrammic pyramid has a [pentagram](/wiki/Pentagram \"Pentagram\") base and 5\nintersecting triangle sides.\n\n    [![Pentagram pyramid.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Pentagram_pyramid.png/120px-Pentagram_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:Pentagram_pyramid.png)\n\n## Right pyramids with an irregular\nbase[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pyramid_\\(geometry\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Right pyramids with an irregular base\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/General_right_pyramid.png/220px-\nGeneral_right_pyramid.png)](/wiki/File:General_right_pyramid.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:General_right_pyramid.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nExample general right pyramid with apex above the centroid of a base polygon\n\nA **right pyramid** can be named as ( )∨P, where ( ) is the apex point, ∨ is a\njoin operator, and P is a base polygon.\n\nAn **isosceles triangle right tetrahedron** can be written as ( )∨[( )∨{ }] as\nthe join of a point to an [isosceles triangle](/wiki/Isosceles_triangle\n\"Isosceles triangle\") base, as [( )∨( )]∨{ } or { }∨{ } as the join\n(orthogonal offsets) of two orthogonal segments, a [digonal\ndisphenoid](/wiki/Digonal_disphenoid \"Digonal disphenoid\"), containing 4\nisosceles triangle faces.

This works for any polygon, regular or non-regular, and\nany location of the apex, provided that _h_ is measured as the\n[perpendicular](/wiki/Perpendicular \"Perpendicular\") distance from the\n[plane](/wiki/Plane_\\(geometry\\) \"Plane \\(geometry\\)\") containing the base. In\n499 AD [Aryabhata](/wiki/Aryabhata \"Aryabhata\"), a\n[mathematician](/wiki/Mathematician\n\"Mathematician\")-[astronomer](/wiki/Astronomer \"Astronomer\") from the\nclassical age of [Indian mathematics](/wiki/Indian_mathematics \"Indian\nmathematics\") and [Indian astronomy](/wiki/Indian_astronomy \"Indian\nastronomy\"), used this method in the _[Aryabhatiya](/wiki/Aryabhatiya\n\"Aryabhatiya\")_ (section 2.6).\n\nThe formula can be formally proved using calculus. By similarity, the _linear_\ndimensions of a cross-section parallel to the base increase linearly from the\napex to the base. The scaling factor (proportionality factor) is  1 − y h\n{\\displaystyle 1-{\\tfrac {y}{h}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle 1-{\\\\tfrac\n{y}{h}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02d2cda3d4f10f8426d643bab895505202d5d7e3),\nor  h − y h {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {h-y}{h}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\tfrac\n{h-y}{h}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dcff0c7947a7123356641601ba308e26b33dd30b),\nwhere _h_ is the height and _y_ is the perpendicular distance from the plane\nof the base to the cross-section. Since the [area](/wiki/Area \"Area\") of any\ncross-section is proportional to the square of the shape's\n[scaling](/wiki/Scaling_\\(geometry\\) \"Scaling \\(geometry\\)\") factor, the area\nof a cross-section at height _y_ is  b ( h − y ) 2 h 2 {\\displaystyle b{\\tfrac\n{(h-y)^{2}}{h^{2}}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle b{\\\\tfrac\n{\\(h-y\\)^{2}}{h^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8975953d9eb0bf9ad15e930e2356469672ee64f),\nor since both _b_ and _h_ are constants,  b h 2 ( h − y ) 2 {\\displaystyle\n{\\tfrac {b}{h^{2}}}(h-y)^{2}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\tfrac\n{b}{h^{2}}}\\(h-y\\)^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f62ce428b158894db1fc9e84a53521bb9e6a4f3).\nThe volume is given by the integral\n\n     b h 2 ∫ 0 h ( h − y ) 2 d y = − b 3 h 2 ( h − y ) 3 | 0 h = 1 3 b h . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {b}{h^{2}}}\\int _{0}^{h}(h-y)^{2}\\,dy={\\frac {-b}{3h^{2}}}(h-y)^{3}{\\bigg |}_{0}^{h}={\\tfrac {1}{3}}bh.} ![{\\\\frac  {b}{h^{2}}}\\\\int _{0}^{h}\\(h-y\\)^{2}\\\\,dy={\\\\frac  {-b}{3h^{2}}}\\(h-y\\)^{3}{\\\\bigg |}_{0}^{h}={\\\\tfrac  {1}{3}}bh.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/edc9cc4d15f6189b6a3ea35d91de3d07231d083e)\n\nThe same equation,  V = 1 3 b h {\\displaystyle V={\\tfrac {1}{3}}bh}\n![{\\\\displaystyle V={\\\\tfrac\n{1}{3}}bh}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1a5847f5f00b07da3b82f4baef764a362c6140d),\nalso holds for cones with any base. This can be proven by an argument similar\nto the one above; see [volume of a cone](/wiki/Cone_\\(geometry\\)#Volume \"Cone\n\\(geometry\\)\").\n\nFor example, the volume of a pyramid whose base is an _n_ -sided [regular\npolygon](/wiki/Regular_polygon \"Regular polygon\") with side length _s_ and\nwhose height is _h_ is\n\n     V = n 12 h s 2 cot ⁡ π n . {\\displaystyle V={\\frac {n}{12}}hs^{2}\\cot {\\frac {\\pi }{n}}.} ![V={\\\\frac  {n}{12}}hs^{2}\\\\cot {\\\\frac  {\\\\pi }{n}}.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef6a55fde5a4105d418a8d1dae1fad22c59cc4cb)\n\nThe formula can also be derived exactly without calculus for pyramids with\nrectangular bases. Consider a unit cube. Draw lines from the center of the\ncube to each of the 8 vertices. This partitions the cube into 6 equal square\npyramids of base area 1 and height 1/2. Each pyramid clearly has volume of\n1/6. From this we deduce that pyramid volume = height × base area / 3.\n\nNext, expand the cube uniformly in three directions by unequal amounts so that\nthe resulting rectangular solid edges are _a_ , _b_ and _c_ , with solid\nvolume _abc_. Each of the 6 pyramids within are likewise expanded. And each\npyramid has the same volume _abc_ /6. Since pairs of pyramids have heights _a_\n/2, _b_ /2 and _c_ /2, we see that pyramid volume = height × base area / 3\nagain.\n\nWhen the side triangles are equilateral, the formula for the volume is\n\n     V = 1 12 n s 3 cot ⁡ ( π n ) 1 − 1 4 sin 2 ⁡ π n . {\\displaystyle V={\\frac {1}{12}}ns^{3}\\cot \\left({\\frac {\\pi }{n}}\\right){\\sqrt {1-{\\frac {1}{4\\sin ^{2}{\\tfrac {\\pi }{n}}}}}}.} ![{\\\\displaystyle V={\\\\frac {1}{12}}ns^{3}\\\\cot \\\\left\\({\\\\frac {\\\\pi }{n}}\\\\right\\){\\\\sqrt {1-{\\\\frac {1}{4\\\\sin ^{2}{\\\\tfrac {\\\\pi }{n}}}}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d9c2de89ada28df32fd4648acccfec1a06f08e2)\n\nThis formula only applies for _n_ = 2, 3, 4 and 5; and it also covers the case\n_n_ = 6, for which the volume equals zero (i.e., the pyramid height is\nzero).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\n## Surface\narea[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pyramid_\\(geometry\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Surface area\")]\n\nThe [surface area](/wiki/Surface_area \"Surface area\") of a pyramid is  A = B +\nP L 2 {\\displaystyle A=B+{\\tfrac {PL}{2}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle A=B+{\\\\tfrac\n{PL}{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fcc278734ac4d609bb979e061d6def1dc641b329),\nwhere _B_ is the base area, _P_ is the base [perimeter](/wiki/Perimeter\n\"Perimeter\"), and the [slant height](/wiki/Slant_height \"Slant height\") L = h\n2 + r 2 {\\displaystyle L={\\sqrt {h^{2}+r^{2}}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle L={\\\\sqrt\n{h^{2}+r^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c88df03580c3f0115bc7ca36af82dd92d9291a1),\nwhere _h_ is the pyramid altitude and _r_ is the [inradius](/wiki/Inradius\n\"Inradius\") of the base.\n\n## n-dimensional\npyramids[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pyramid_\\(geometry\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: n-dimensional pyramids\")]\n\nA 2-dimensional pyramid is a triangle, formed by a base edge connected to a\nnoncolinear point called an [apex](/wiki/Apex_\\(geometry\\) \"Apex\n\\(geometry\\)\").\n\nA 4-dimensional pyramid is called a [polyhedral\npyramid](/wiki/Polyhedral_pyramid \"Polyhedral pyramid\"), constructed by a\n[polyhedron](/wiki/Polyhedron \"Polyhedron\") in a 3-space hyperplane of 4-space\nwith another point off that hyperplane.\n\nHigher-dimensional pyramids are constructed similarly.\n\nThe family of [simplices](/wiki/Simplex \"Simplex\") represent pyramids in any\ndimension, increasing from [triangle](/wiki/Triangle \"Triangle\"),\n[tetrahedron](/wiki/Tetrahedron \"Tetrahedron\"), [5-cell](/wiki/5-cell\n\"5-cell\"), [5-simplex](/wiki/5-simplex \"5-simplex\"), etc. A n-dimensional\nsimplex has the minimum _n+1_ [vertices](/wiki/Vertex_\\(geometry\\) \"Vertex\n\\(geometry\\)\"), with all pairs of vertices connected by\n[edges](/wiki/Edge_\\(geometry\\) \"Edge \\(geometry\\)\"), all triples of vertices\ndefining faces, all quadruples of points defining tetrahedral\n[cells](/wiki/Cell_\\(geometry\\) \"Cell \\(geometry\\)\"), etc.\n\n### Polyhedral\npyramid[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pyramid_\\(geometry\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Polyhedral pyramid\")]\n\nIn 4-dimensional [geometry](/wiki/Geometry \"Geometry\"), a **polyhedral\npyramid** is a [4-polytope](/wiki/4-polytope \"4-polytope\") constructed by a\nbase [polyhedron](/wiki/Polyhedron \"Polyhedron\") cell and an\n[apex](/wiki/Apex_\\(geometry\\) \"Apex \\(geometry\\)\") point.
