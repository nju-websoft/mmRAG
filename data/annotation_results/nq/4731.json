Just then, a young wizard-in-training, Jack, enters the shop\nwith his mentor, the powerful wizard Kalstaff, to choose a familiar. Aldwyn\nwas chosen, even though he could not be a true familiar as he was not magical\n(Jack did not know that of course). They travelled back to Stone Runlet,\nKalstaff's dwelling, together, and Aldwyn met the other two wizards-in-\ntraining, Dalton and Marianne, as well as their respective familiars, Skylar\nand Gilbert.\n\nJust when Aldwyn had settled down and was finally content, with an omen of\nthree shooting stars, portending that three young wizards from Stone Runlet\nwould save the world, things took a dark turn. That night, Queen Loranella, an\nold ally of Kalstaff as well as sovereign of the kingdom appeared. She turned\non her old friend Kalstaff, killing him, then kidnapped Jack, Marianne and\nDalton, leaving the three familiars behind.\n\nAldwyn, Skylar and Gilbert, determined to save their loyals (the human\ncompanion of a familiar), go on a quest to free them. They experience many\ntrials on their quest, vanquishes a witch, defeats a mountain troll, pay a\nvisit to Gilbert's homeland, and encounters the great Mountain Alchemist, who\nalong with Queen Loranella and Kalstaff, were the first 'prophesized three' 60\nyears ago. Finally, just before the third sunset when the protection spells\naround their three loyals fade, which will allow Queen Loranella to finally\nkill them, the three familiars arrive. Upon arrival, they realize that their\nreal enemy is the Queen Loranella's familiar, a hare named Paksahara, who had\nimprisoned the real queen, and shifted into her likeliness. They also become\naware that murdering Kalstaff and kidnapping their loyals was also really done\nby Paksahara under the guise of Queen Loranella. As the three familiars make\ndesperate endeavors to rescue their loyals, Aldwyn discovers that he is in\nfact magical and possesses the power of [telekinesis](/wiki/Telekinesis\n\"Telekinesis\").

All of a sudden, when human\nmagic mysteriously disappears from the land, Queen Loranella is rendered\npowerless, and is thus unable to stop the impending army of the Dead led by\nPaksahara which is about to invade the land. Hence, it is once more up to the\nfamiliars to save the land.\n\nIn order to do so, they must find the Shifting Fortress from which Paksahara\nis casting her magic from. However, the Shifting Fortress never appears in the\nsame place twice, and the only way to access it is to find the Snow Leopard's\nCrown. Following the clues hidden in a nursery rhyme, the familiars find their\nway to the sacred Tree Temple where they discovered that the Spheris, the\nglobe which would lead them towards the Crown, had been taken three years ago\nby none other than Aldwyn's father, Baxley. Desiring to find out all they can\nabout Baxley, and bearing the knowledge that the future of the Queendom of\nVastia depended on it, the three travel to Maidenmere, Aldwyn's birthplace.\nThey discover that the pride leader of the Maidenmere Bicoloured Cats, masters\nof telekinesis, Malvern, is Aldwyn's own uncle. Malvern introduces Aldwyn to a\nkind of magic which permits him to see the last footsteps of his father -\nwhich would end either when he found his father, or when he arrived at the\nlast place Baxley had been before dying.\n\nGuided by the footsteps of his father and the clues, the familiars face many\ndangers before arriving at their destination - the place where the Snow\nLeopard's crown lies. They found out that the crown is really a circle formed\nby seven ancient stones, each of which speaks the name of an animal upon\ncontact. In order to summon the shifting fortress, the familiars have to bring\nthe seven animals together. Then they find out Malvern is a traitor working\nfor Paksahara. Malvern had drowned Aldwyn's mother and tricked his father,\nBaxley, into dying. Malvern was killed by a blast from Paksahara when she\ntried to shoot Aldwyn but missed instead. The book ends with the familiars,\nwith the hired help of the bounty hunter Grimslade, prepare to seek out the\nseven animals, as Paksahara's Dead Army begins their invasion on Vastia.\n\n### _The Familiars: Circle of Heroes_\n(2012)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Familiars_\\(novel\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: The Familiars: Circle of Heroes \\(2012\\)\")]\n\nThe Familiars: Circle of Heroes  \n---  \nPublication date | September 4, 2012  \nPages | 336  \n[ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") | [978-0-06-196114-4](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-06-196114-4 \"Special:BookSources/978-0-06-196114-4\")  \nPreceded by | _The Familiars: Secrets of the Crown_  \nFollowed by | _The Familiars: Palace of Dreams_  \n  \nHuman magic in Vastia is still gone, and as the familiars begin their journey\nto find the seven animals needed to summon the Shifting Fortress, an army of\nthe Dead besieges the city of Bridgetower, destroying the first of three glyph\nstones, the only places where the Shifting Fortress can be called from. They\nescape, but are forced to leave the bounty hunter, Grimslade, behind. The\nfamiliars retain the map he made to find the animals, however, and use it to\nstart their journey, leaving their loyals, Jack, Marianne, and Dalton, in the\ncellar of Stone Runlet to keep them safe.\n\nTraveling to different places, the familiars collect all animals needed to\nsummon the fortress. During this time, two of the three glyph stones fall,\nAldwyn learns the current whereabouts of his twin sister, Yeardly, and has\nanother encounter with his traitorous uncle, Malvern, who has been brought\nback to life due to Paksahara's summoning of the Dead.\n\nHeading to the final glyph stone outside of Bronzhaven, the familiars and the\nseven animals needed to summon the Shifting Fortress encounter a brutal battle\nbetween Paksahara's zombie forces and Queen Loranella's troops. They manage to\nmake it to the third glyph stone, and summon the Shifting Fortress. The\nfamiliars and a few of their animal friends journey inside to stop Paksahara.\nAfter being accosted in the fortress by Dead warriors, the familiars' friends\nstay behind to fend them off, leaving Aldwyn, Skylar, and Gilbert to continue\non.\n\nOnce more, Aldwyn encounters his uncle, but puts an end to him this time. They\ncontinue to the room where Paksahara waits, resulting in a deadly battle. In\nthe midst, Gilbert attempts to summon fire and successfully completes a spell,\nshowing the improvement of his magic. Paksahara takes advantage of this\ndistraction to disguise herself as Gilbert.\n\nAldwyn discovers he has inherited his mother's telepathic powers as he and\nSkylar struggle to find the real Gilbert, and he uses this power to determine\nwhich frog is Gilbert, giving Skylar the opportunity to kill Paksahara. The\nfamiliars release human magic back into Vastia, which helps turn the tide of\nthe battle raging outside Bronzhaven, resulting in the success of Loranella's\narmy. However, Paksahara is brought back to life by the spell she used to\nsummon the Dead. The familiars vanquish her once more by throwing her to the\nvultures that swarm above the battleground, who destroy her carcass.\n\nLater on, the familiars are reunited with their loyals. Aldwyn, Skylar, and\nGilbert are thanked by the queen and her new council, which now consists of a\nmixture of humans and animals. They are immortalized in a picture in a stained\nglass window. As they study it, Gilbert tells Aldwyn about his latest puddle\nvision: that their adventures aren't over yet.\n\n### _The Familiars: Palace of Dreams_\n(2013)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Familiars_\\(novel\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: The Familiars: Palace of Dreams \\(2013\\)\")]\n\nThe Familiars: Palace of Dreams  \n---  \nPublication date | December 23, 2013  \nPages | 323  \n[ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") | [978-0-06-212029-8](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-06-212029-8 \"Special:BookSources/978-0-06-212029-8\")  \nPreceded by | _The Familiars: Circle of Heroes_  \n  \nThe Three are invited to Queen Loranella's birthday party, whence they bestow\na gift for her.
