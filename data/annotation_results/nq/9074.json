Greece\") [city-state](/wiki/City-state\n\"City-state\") (known as a [polis](/wiki/Polis \"Polis\")) of\n[Athens](/wiki/Classical_Athens \"Classical Athens\"), comprising the city of\nAthens and the surrounding territory of [Attica](/wiki/Attica \"Attica\"), and\nis the first known [democracy](/wiki/Democracy \"Democracy\") in the world.\nOther Greek cities set up democracies, most following the Athenian model, but\nnone are as well documented as Athens'.\n\nIt was a system of [direct democracy](/wiki/Direct_democracy \"Direct\ndemocracy\"), in which participating [citizens](/wiki/Citizenship\n\"Citizenship\") voted directly on [legislation](/wiki/Legislation\n\"Legislation\") and executive bills. Participation was not open to all\nresidents: to vote one had to be an adult, male citizen i.e. neither a\n[foreign resident](/wiki/Metic \"Metic\") nor a\n[slave](/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Greece \"Slavery in ancient Greece\"), and the\nnumber of these \"varied between 30,000 and 50,000 out of a total population of\naround 250,000 to 300,000\" or \"no more than 30 percent of the total adult\npopulation.\"[1]\n\nThe longest-lasting democratic leader was [Pericles](/wiki/Pericles\n\"Pericles\"). After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted\nby [oligarchic](/wiki/Oligarchic \"Oligarchic\") revolutions towards the end of\nthe [Peloponnesian War](/wiki/Peloponnesian_War \"Peloponnesian War\"). It was\nmodified somewhat after it was restored under [Eucleides](/wiki/Eucleides\n\"Eucleides\"); the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-\ncentury modification rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was\nsuppressed by the [Macedonians](/wiki/Macedonia_\\(ancient_kingdom\\) \"Macedonia\n\\(ancient kingdom\\)\") in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived,\nbut how close they were to a real democracy is debatable. [Solon](/wiki/Solon\n\"Solon\") (594 BC), [Cleisthenes](/wiki/Cleisthenes \"Cleisthenes\") (508/7 BC),\nand [Ephialtes](/wiki/Ephialtes \"Ephialtes\") (462 BC) contributed to the\ndevelopment of Athenian democracy. Cleisthenes broke up the power of the\nnobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived\nrather than on their wealth.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Etymology\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 Development\n    * 2.2 Aftermath\n  * 3 Participation and exclusion\n    * 3.1 Size and make-up of the Athenian population\n    * 3.2 Citizenship in Athens\n  * 4 Main bodies of governance\n    * 4.1 Assembly/Ecclesia\n    * 4.2 The Council/The Boule\n    * 4.3 Courts\n    * 4.4 Shifting balance between assembly and courts\n    * 4.5 Citizen-initiator\n    * 4.6 Archons and the Areopagus\n    * 4.7 Officeholders\n      * 4.7.1 Selection by lot (sortition / allotment)\n      * 4.7.2 Election\n  * 5 Individualism in Athenian democracy\n  * 6 Criticism of the democracy\n  * 7 Legacy\n  * 8 References and sources\n  * 9 External links\n\n##\nEtymology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Etymology\")]\n\nThe word \"democracy\" (Greek: δημοκρατία) combines the elements _dêmos_ (δῆμος,\nwhich means \"people\", \"neighbourhood\", \"district\") and _krátos_ (κράτος, which\nmeans \"force\" or \"power\"), and thus means literally \"people power\". In the\nwords \"monarchy\" and \"oligarchy\", the second element comes from _archē_\n(ἀρχή), meaning \"beginning (that which comes first)\", and hence also \"first\nplace or power\", \"sovereignty\". One might expect the term \"demarchy\" to have\nbeen adopted, by analogy, for the new form of government introduced by\nAthenian democrats. However, the word \"demarchy\" (δημαρχία) had already been\ntaken and meant \"[mayoralty](/wiki/Mayoralty \"Mayoralty\")\", the office or rank\nof a high [municipal](/wiki/Municipal \"Municipal\")\n[magistrate](/wiki/Magistrate \"Magistrate\"). (In present-day use, the term\n\"[demarchy](/wiki/Demarchy \"Demarchy\")\" has acquired a new meaning.)\n\nWe are not certain that the word \"democracy\" was in existence when systems\nthat came to be called democratic were first instituted. The word is attested\nin [Herodotus](/wiki/Herodotus \"Herodotus\")\n(_[Histories](/wiki/Histories_\\(Herodotus\\) \"Histories \\(Herodotus\\)\")_ 6.43),\nwho wrote some of the earliest surviving Greek prose, but this might not have\nbeen before 440 or 430 BC. Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name\nof 'Democrates',[2] a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty;\nthe name can also be found in [Aeolian](/wiki/Aeolis \"Aeolis\")\n[Temnus](/wiki/Temnus \"Temnus\").[3]\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nAthens was not the only [polis](/wiki/Polis \"Polis\") in Ancient Greece that\ninstituted a democratic regime. Aristotle cites many other cities as well.\n\"Yet, it is only with reference to Athens that we can attempt to trace some of\nspecific sixth century events that led to the institution of democracy at the\nend of the century.\"[4]\n\nBefore the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by a\nseries of [archons](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\") or chief magistrates, and the\n[Areopagus](/wiki/Areopagus \"Areopagus\"), made up of ex-archons. The members\nof these institutions were generally aristocrats, who ruled the polis for\ntheir own advantage. In 621 BC [Draco](/wiki/Draco_\\(lawgiver\\) \"Draco\n\\(lawgiver\\)\") codified a set of \"notoriously harsh\" laws that were \"a clear\nexpression of the power of the aristocracy over everybody else.\" This did not\nstop the aristocratic families feuding amongst themselves to obtain as much\npower as possible.[5]\n\nTherefore, by the 6th century BC, the majority of Athenians \"had been\n'enslaved' to the rich\", and they called upon Plato's ancestor\n[Solon](/wiki/Solon \"Solon\"), premier archon at the time, to liberate them and\nhalt the feuding of the aristocracy. However, the \"enfranchisement of the\nlocal laboring classes was succeeded by the development of chattel slavery,\nthe enslavement of, in large part, foreigners.\"[6]\n\nSolon, the mediator, reshaped the city \"by absorbing the traditional\naristocracy in a definition of citizenship which allotted a political function\nto every free resident of Attica. Athenians were not slaves but citizens, with\nthe right, at the very least, to participate in the meetings of the assembly.\"\nUnder these reforms, the position of archon \"was opened to all with certain\nproperty qualifications, and a [Boule](/wiki/Boule_\\(ancient_Greece\\) \"Boule\n\\(ancient Greece\\)\"), a rival council of 400, was set up. The Areopagus,\nnevertheless, retained 'guardianship of the laws'\".[7] A major contribution to\ndemocracy was Solon's setting up of an\n_[Ecclesia](/wiki/Ecclesia_\\(ancient_Athens\\) \"Ecclesia \\(ancient Athens\\)\")_\nor Assembly, which was open to all male citizens. However, \"one must bear in\nmind that its agenda was apparently set entirely by the Council of 400\",\n\"consisting of 100 members from each of the four tribes\", that had taken \"over\nmany of the powers which the Areopagos had previously exercised.\"[5]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Cleisthenes.jpg/200px-\nCleisthenes.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cleisthenes.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cleisthenes.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Cleisthenes](/wiki/Cleisthenes \"Cleisthenes\")\n\nNot long afterwards, the nascent democracy was overthrown by the tyrant\n[Peisistratos](/wiki/Peisistratos \"Peisistratos\"), but was reinstated after\nthe expulsion of his son, [Hippias](/wiki/Hippias_\\(tyrant\\) \"Hippias\n\\(tyrant\\)\"), in 510. This sort of aristocratic takeover \"was ended by the\nappeal by one contender, [Cleisthenes](/wiki/Cleisthenes \"Cleisthenes\"), for\nthe support of the populace.\" The reforms of Cleisthenes in 508/7 undermined\nthe domination of the aristocratic families and connected every Athenian to\nthe city's rule. \"Cleisthenes fixed the boundaries of the polis as a political\nrather than a geographical entity – boundaries which Solon had left permeable\n– by formally identifying the free inhabitants of Attica at that time as\nAthenian citizens.\"[8] He did this by making the traditional tribes\npolitically irrelevant and instituting ten new tribes, each made up of about\nthree _trytties_ , each consisting of several _[demes](/wiki/Deme \"Deme\")_.\n\"Every male citizen on reaching the age of 18 was now to be registered in his\ndeme. It was this registration which confirmed his citizenship.\"[9]\n\nA third set of reforms was instigated by [Ephialtes](/wiki/Ephialtes\n\"Ephialtes\") in 462/1. While his opponents were away attempting to assist the\nSpartans, Ephialtes persuaded the Assembly to reduce the powers of the\nAreopagus: \"in effect stripping it of all its controlling and supervisory\npowers and leaving it only as a court for cases of homicide and certain\noffences of sacrilege.\" At the same time or soon afterwards, the membership of\nthe Areopagus was extended to the lower level of the propertied\ncitizenship.[10]\n\nIn the wake of Athens' disastrous defeat in the [Sicilian\ncampaign](/wiki/Sicilian_expedition \"Sicilian expedition\") in 413 BCE, a group\nof citizens took steps to limit the radical democracy they thought was leading\nthe city to ruin. Their efforts, initially conducted through constitutional\nchannels, culminated in the establishment of an oligarchy, the Council of 400,\nin the [Athenian coup of 411 BCE](/wiki/Athenian_coup_of_411_BC \"Athenian coup\nof 411 BC\"). The oligarchy endured for only four months before it was replaced\nby a more democratic government. Democratic regimes governed until Athens\nsurrendered to Sparta in 404 BCE, when government was placed in the hands of\nthe so-called [Thirty Tyrants](/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants \"Thirty Tyrants\"), pro-\nSpartan oligarchs.[11] After a year pro-democracy elements regained control,\nand democratic forms persisted until the Macedonian army of Phillip II\nconquered Athens in 338 BC.[12]\n\n###\nAftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\n[Alexander the Great](/wiki/Alexander_the_Great \"Alexander the Great\") had led\na coalition of the Greek states to war with Persia in 336 BC, but his Greek\nsoldiers were hostages for the behavior of their states as much as allies. His\nrelations with Athens were already strained when he returned to\n[Babylon](/wiki/Babylon \"Babylon\") in 324 BC; after his death, Athens and\nSparta led several Greek states to war with Macedon and lost.[13]\n\nThis led to the Hellenistic control of Athens, when the Macedonian king\nappointed a local agent as political governor in Athens. However, the\ngovernors, like [Demetrius of Phalerum](/wiki/Demetrius_of_Phalerum \"Demetrius\nof Phalerum\"), appointed by [Cassander](/wiki/Cassander \"Cassander\"), kept\nsome of the traditional institutions in formal existence, although the\nAthenian public would consider them to be nothing more than Macedonian puppet\ndictators. Once [Demetrius Poliorcetes](/wiki/Demetrius_Poliorcetes \"Demetrius\nPoliorcetes\") ended Cassander's rule over Athens, Demetrius of Phalerum went\ninto exile and the democracy was restored in 307 BC. However, by now Athens\nhad become \"politically impotent\".[14] An example of this was that, in 307, in\norder to curry favour with Macedonia and Egypt, three new tribes were created,\ntwo in honour of the Macedonian king and his son, and the other in honour of\nthe Egyptian king.\n\nHowever, when [Rome](/wiki/Ancient_Rome \"Ancient Rome\") fought Macedonia in\n200, the Athenians abolished the first two new tribes and created a twelfth\ntribe in honour of the [Pergamene](/wiki/Pergamene \"Pergamene\") king. The\nAthenians declared for Rome, and in 146 BC Athens became an autonomous\n_civitas foederata_. \"Her independence was however little more than municipal,\nand, though the forms of the democracy survived, Rome ... strengthened the\naristocratic elements in the constitution.\"[15]\n\nUnder Roman rule, the [archons](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\") ranked as the highest\nofficials. They were elected, and even foreigners such as\n[Domitian](/wiki/Domitian \"Domitian\") and [Hadrian](/wiki/Hadrian \"Hadrian\")\nheld the office as a mark of honour. Four presided over the judicial\nadministration. The Council (whose numbers varied at different times from\nthree hundred to seven hundred and fifty) was appointed by lot. It was\nsuperseded in importance by the [Areopagus](/wiki/Areopagus \"Areopagus\"),\nwhich, recruited from the elected archons, had an aristocratic character and\nwas entrusted with wide powers. From the time of Hadrian an imperial curator\nsuperintended the finances. The shadow of the old constitution lingered on and\nArchons and Areopagus survived the fall of the Roman Empire.[15]\n\nIn 88 BC, there was a revolution under the philosopher Athenion, who, as\ntyrant, forced the Assembly to agree to elect whomever he might ask to office.\nAthenion allied with [Mithridates of Pontus](/wiki/Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus\n\"Mithridates VI of Pontus\"), and went to war with Rome; he was killed during\nthe war, and was replaced by [Aristion](/wiki/Aristion \"Aristion\"). The\nvictorious Roman general, [Publius Cornelius\nSulla](/wiki/Publius_Cornelius_Sulla \"Publius Cornelius Sulla\"), left the\nAthenians their lives and did not sell them into slavery; he also restored the\nprevious government, in 86 BC.[16]\n\nAfter Rome became an Empire under [Augustus](/wiki/Augustus \"Augustus\"), the\nnominal independence of Athens dissolved and its government converged to the\nnormal type for a Roman municipality, with a Senate of\n_[decuriones](/wiki/Decurion_\\(administrative\\) \"Decurion\n\\(administrative\\)\")_.[17]\n\n## Participation and\nexclusion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Participation and exclusion\")]\n\n### Size and make-up of the Athenian\npopulation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Size and make-up of the Athenian population\")]\n\nEstimates of the population of ancient Athens vary. During the 4th century BC,\nthere might well have been some 250,000–300,000 people in Attica. Citizen\nfamilies could have amounted to 100,000 people and out of these some 30,000\nwould have been the adult male citizens entitled to vote in the assembly. In\nthe mid-5th century the number of adult male citizens was perhaps as high as\n60,000, but this number fell precipitously during the Peloponnesian War.[18]\nThis slump was permanent, due to the introduction of a stricter definition of\ncitizen described below. From a modern perspective these figures may seem\nsmall, but among Greek city-states Athens was huge: most of the thousand or so\nGreek cities could only muster 1000–1500 adult male citizens each; and\nCorinth, a major power, had at most 15,000.[19]\n\nThe non-citizen component of the population was made up of resident foreigners\n([metics](/wiki/Metic \"Metic\")) and slaves, with the latter perhaps somewhat\nmore numerous. Around 338 BC the orator [Hyperides](/wiki/Hyperides\n\"Hyperides\") (fragment 13) claimed that there were 150,000 slaves in Attica,\nbut this figure is probably no more than an impression: slaves outnumbered\nthose of citizen stock but did not swamp them.[20]\n\n### Citizenship in\nAthens[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Citizenship in Athens\")]\n\nOnly adult male Athenian citizens who had completed their military training as\n[ephebes](/wiki/Ephebos \"Ephebos\") had the right to vote in Athens. The\npercentage of the population that actually participated in the government was\n10% to 20% of the total number of inhabitants, but this varied from the fifth\nto the fourth century BC.[18] This excluded a majority of the population:\n[slaves](/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Greece \"Slavery in ancient Greece\"), freed\nslaves, children, women and [metics](/wiki/Metic \"Metic\") (foreigners resident\nin Athens).[21] The women had limited rights and privileges, had restricted\nmovement in public, and were very segregated from the men.[22]\n\nAlso excluded from voting were citizens whose rights were under suspension\n(typically for failure to pay a debt to the city: see\n[atimia](/wiki/Atimia_\\(loss_of_citizen_rights\\) \"Atimia \\(loss of citizen\nrights\\)\")); for some Athenians this amounted to permanent (and in fact\ninheritable) disqualification. Given the exclusive and ancestral concept of\ncitizenship held by Greek [city-states](/wiki/City-states \"City-states\"), a\nrelatively large portion of the population took part in the government of\nAthens and of other radical democracies like it, compared to oligarchies and\naristocracies.[18]\n\nAt Athens some citizens were far more active than others, but the vast numbers\nrequired for the system to work testify to a breadth of direct participation\namong those eligible that greatly surpassed any present-day democracy.[18]\nAthenian citizens had to be descended from citizens—after the reforms of\nPericles and Cimon in 450 BC, they \"would be confined to those whose parents\nwere both Athenian\".[23] Although the legislation was not retrospective, five\nyears later, when a free gift of grain had arrived from the Egyptian king, to\nbe distributed among all citizens, \"many 'illegitimates' were discovered\" and\nremoved from the registers.[24]\n\nCitizenship, \"commonly applied not only to the individuals themselves but to\ntheir descendants as well\", could be granted by the assembly, and was\nsometimes given to large groups (e.g. [Plateans](/wiki/Platea \"Platea\") in 427\nBC and [Samians](/wiki/Samians \"Samians\") in 405 BC) but, by the 4th century,\nonly to individuals and by a special vote with a quorum of 6000. This was\ngenerally done as a reward for some service to the state. In the course of a\ncentury, the number of citizenships so granted was in the hundreds rather than\nthousands.[25]\n\n## Main bodies of\ngovernance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Main bodies of governance\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Constitution-of-the-\nAthenians-in-the-4th-century-BC.png/900px-Constitution-of-the-Athenians-in-\nthe-4th-century-BC.png)](/wiki/File:Constitution-of-the-Athenians-in-the-4th-\ncentury-BC.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Constitution-of-the-Athenians-in-the-4th-century-BC.png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nConstitution of the Athenians, 4th century BC\n\nThere were three political bodies where citizens gathered in numbers running\ninto the hundreds or thousands. These are the assembly (in some cases with a\nquorum of 6000), the council of 500 (_[boule](/wiki/Boule_\\(ancient_Greece\\)\n\"Boule \\(ancient Greece\\)\")_) and the courts (a minimum of 200 people, but\nrunning at least on some occasions up to 6000). Of these three bodies it is\nthe assembly and the courts that were the true sites of power – although\ncourts, unlike the assembly, were never simply called the _demos_ (the People)\nas they were manned by a subset of the citizen body, those over thirty. But\ncrucially citizens voting in both were not subject to review and prosecution\nas were council members and all other officeholders.\n\nIn the 5th century BC we often hear of the assembly sitting as a court of\njudgment itself for trials of political importance and it is not a coincidence\nthat 6000 is the number both for the full quorum for the assembly and for the\nannual pool from which jurors were picked for particular trials. By the\nmid-4th century however the assembly's judicial functions were largely\ncurtailed, though it always kept a role in the initiation of various kinds of\npolitical trial.\n\n###\nAssembly/Ecclesia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Assembly/Ecclesia\")]\n\nMain article: [Ecclesia (ancient Athens)](/wiki/Ecclesia_\\(ancient_Athens\\)\n\"Ecclesia \\(ancient Athens\\)\")\n\nThe central events of the Athenian democracy were the meetings of the\n[assembly](/wiki/Ecclesia_\\(ancient_Athens\\) \"Ecclesia \\(ancient Athens\\)\")\n(ἐκκλησία, _ekklêsia_). Unlike a [parliament](/wiki/Parliament \"Parliament\"),\nthe assembly's members were not elected, but attended by right when they\nchose. Greek democracy created at Athens was [direct](/wiki/Direct_democracy\n\"Direct democracy\"), rather than\n[representative](/wiki/Representative_democracy \"Representative democracy\"):\nany adult male citizen over the age of 20 could take part,[26] and it was a\nduty to do so. The officials of the democracy were in part elected by the\nAssembly and in large part chosen by lottery in a process called\n[sortition](/wiki/Sortition \"Sortition\").\n\nThe assembly had four main functions: it made executive pronouncements\n(decrees, such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a\nforeigner); it elected some officials; it legislated; and it tried political\ncrimes. As the system evolved, the last function was shifted to the law\ncourts. The standard format was that of speakers making speeches for and\nagainst a position followed by a general vote (usually by show of hands) of\nyes or no.\n\nThough there might be blocs of opinion, sometimes enduring, on important\nmatters, there were no political parties and likewise no\n[government](/wiki/Forms_of_government \"Forms of government\") or\n[opposition](/wiki/Opposition_\\(parliamentary\\) \"Opposition\n\\(parliamentary\\)\") (as in the [Westminster system](/wiki/Westminster_system\n\"Westminster system\")). Voting was by simple [majority](/wiki/Majority_rule\n\"Majority rule\"). In the 5th century at least there were scarcely any limits\non the power exercised by the assembly. If the assembly broke the law, the\nonly thing that might happen is that it would punish those who had made the\nproposal that it had agreed to. If a mistake had been made, from the\nassembly's viewpoint it could only be because it had been misled.[27]\n\nAs usual in ancient democracies, one had to physically attend a gathering in\norder to vote. Military service or simple distance prevented the exercise of\ncitizenship. Voting was usually by show of hands (χειροτονία, _kheirotonia_ ,\n\"arm stretching\") with officials judging the outcome by sight. This could\ncause problems when it became too dark to see properly. However, \"any member\nof the Assembly could demand a recount\".[28] For a small category of votes a\nquorum of 6000 was required, principally grants of citizenship, and here small\ncoloured stones were used, white for yes and black for no. At the end of the\nsession, each voter tossed one of these into a large clay jar which was\nafterwards cracked open for the counting of the ballots.\n[Ostracism](/wiki/Ostracism \"Ostracism\") required the voters to scratch names\nonto pieces of broken pottery (ὄστρακα, _ostraka_), though this did not occur\nwithin the assembly as such.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Pnyx-berg2.png/250px-\nPnyx-berg2.png)](/wiki/File:Pnyx-berg2.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pnyx-berg2.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Pnyx](/wiki/Pnyx \"Pnyx\") with the speaker's platform, the meeting place\nof the people of Athens.\n\nIn the 5th century BC, there were 10 fixed assembly meetings per year, one in\neach of the ten [state months](/wiki/Attic_calendar#State_calendar \"Attic\ncalendar\"), with other meetings called as needed. In the following century the\nmeetings were set to forty a year, with four in each state month. One of these\nwas now called the main meeting, _kyria ekklesia_. Additional meetings might\nstill be called, especially as up until 355 BC there were still political\ntrials that were conducted in the assembly rather than in court. The assembly\nmeetings did not occur at fixed intervals, as they had to avoid clashing with\nthe annual festivals that followed the lunar calendar. There was also a\ntendency for the four meetings to be aggregated toward the end of each state\nmonth.[29]\n\nAttendance at the assembly was not always voluntary. In the 5th century public\nslaves forming a cordon with a red-stained rope herded citizens from the\n[agora](/wiki/Agora \"Agora\") into the assembly meeting place\n([Pnyx](/wiki/Pnyx \"Pnyx\")), with a fine being imposed on those who got the\nred on their clothes.[30] After the restoration of the democracy in 403 BC,\npay for assembly attendance was introduced. This promoted a new enthusiasm for\nassembly meetings. Only the first 6000 to arrive were admitted and paid, with\nthe red rope now used to keep latecomers at bay.[31]\n\n### The Council/The\nBoule[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: The Council/The Boule\")]\n\nMain article: [Boule (ancient Greece) § The Athenian\nBoule](/wiki/Boule_\\(ancient_Greece\\)#The_Athenian_Boule \"Boule \\(ancient\nGreece\\)\")\n\nIn 594 BC Solon is said to have created a boule of 400 to guide the work of\nthe assembly.[32] After the reforms of Cleisthenes, the Athenian Boule was\nexpanded to 500, and was elected by lot every year. Each of Cleisthenes's 10\ntribes provided 50 councillors who were at least 30 years old.\n\n> The most important task of the Athenian Boule was to draft the deliberations\n> (_probouleumata_) for discussion and approval in the Ecclesia. The Boule\n> also directed finances, controlled the maintenance of the fleet and of the\n> cavalry, judged the fitness of the magistrates-elect, received foreign\n> ambassadors, advised the _[stratēgoi](/wiki/Strategos \"Strategos\")_\n> (generals) in military matters, and could be given special powers by the\n> Ecclesia in an emergency.[33]\n\nAccording to John Thorley, its membership was very carefully vetted.\nCleisthenes restricted its membership, \"to those of [zeugitai](/wiki/Zeugitai\n\"Zeugitai\") status and above, probably arguing that these classes had a\nfinancial interest in good government\". A member had to be approved by his\ndeme, \"and one can well imagine that demes were careful to select only those\nof known good sense who also had experience of local politics, and who were\nactually available to do the time-consuming job which demanded frequent\nattendance in Athens; and they probably favoured those who were well past\n30\".[34]\n\nThe members from each of the ten tribes in the Boule took it in turns to act\nas a standing committee (the _[prytaneis](/wiki/Prytaneis \"Prytaneis\")_) of\nthe Boule for a period of thirty-six days. All fifty members of the prytaneis\non duty were housed and fed in the tholos of the\n_[Prytaneion](/wiki/Prytaneion#Tholos.2C_Athens \"Prytaneion\")_ , a building\nadjacent to the _[bouleuterion](/wiki/Bouleuterion \"Bouleuterion\")_ , where\nthe boule met. \"Each day one of their number was chosen by lot as chairman,\nand he was required to stay in the tholos for the twenty-four-hour period of\nhis office. The chairman for the day presided over any meeting of the Boule\nheld that day, and if there was a meeting of the Assembly that day ... he also\npresided over that\".[35]\n\nThe boule also served as an executive committee for the assembly, and oversaw\nthe activities of certain other magistrates. The boule coordinated the\nactivities of the various boards and magistrates that carried out the\nadministrative functions of Athens and provided from its own membership\nrandomly selected boards of ten responsible for areas ranging from naval\naffairs to religious observances.[36] Altogether, the boule was responsible\nfor a great portion of the administration of the state, but was granted\nrelatively little latitude for initiative; the boule's control over policy was\nexecuted in its probouleutic, rather than its executive function; in the\nformer, it prepared measures for deliberation by the assembly, in the latter,\nit merely executed the wishes of the assembly.[37]\n\n### Courts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Courts\")]\n\nAthens had an elaborate legal system centered on full citizen rights (see\n_[atimia](/wiki/Atimia_\\(loss_of_citizen_rights\\) \"Atimia \\(loss of citizen\nrights\\)\")_). The age limit of 30 or older, the same as that for office\nholders but ten years older than that required for participation in the\nassembly, gave the courts a certain standing in relation to the assembly.\nJurors were required to be under oath, which was not required for attendance\nat the assembly. The authority exercised by the courts had the same basis as\nthat of the assembly: both were regarded as expressing the direct will of the\npeople. Unlike office holders (magistrates), who could be impeached and\nprosecuted for misconduct, the jurors could not be censured, for they, in\neffect, were the people and no authority could be higher than that. A\ncorollary of this was that, at least acclaimed by defendants, if a court had\nmade an unjust decision, it must have been because it had been misled by a\nlitigant.[38]\n\nEssentially there were two grades of suit, a smaller kind known as _dike_\n(δίκη) or private suit, and a larger kind known as _graphe_ or public suit.\nFor private suits the minimum jury size was 200 (increased to 401 if a sum of\nover 1000 drachmas was at issue), for public suits 501. Under Cleisthenes'\nreforms, juries were selected by lot from a panel of 600 jurors, there being\n600 jurors from each of the ten tribes of Athens, making a jury pool of 6000\nin total.[39] For particularly important public suits the jury could be\nincreased by adding in extra allotments of 500. 1000 and 1500 are regularly\nencountered as jury sizes and on at least one occasion, the first time a new\nkind of case was brought to court (see _[graphē\nparanómōn](/wiki/Graph%C4%93_paran%C3%B3m%C5%8Dn \"Graphē paranómōn\")_), all\n6,000 members of the jury pool may have attended to one case.[40]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Water_Clock_in_Ancient_Agora_of_Athens.jpg/250px-\nWater_Clock_in_Ancient_Agora_of_Athens.jpg)](/wiki/File:Water_Clock_in_Ancient_Agora_of_Athens.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Water_Clock_in_Ancient_Agora_of_Athens.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWater Clock in the Ancient Agora of Athens.\n\nThe cases were put by the litigants themselves in the form of an exchange of\nsingle speeches timed by a [water clock](/wiki/Water_clock \"Water clock\") or\n_clepsydra_ , first prosecutor then defendant. In a public suit the litigants\neach had three hours to speak, much less in private suits (though here it was\nin proportion to the amount of money at stake). Decisions were made by voting\nwithout any time set aside for deliberation. Jurors did talk informally\namongst themselves during the voting procedure and juries could be rowdy,\nshouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants.\nThis may have had some role in building a consensus. The jury could only cast\na 'yes' or 'no' vote as to the guilt and sentence of the defendant. For\nprivate suits only the victims or their families could prosecute, while for\npublic suits anyone (_ho boulomenos_ , 'whoever wants to' i.e. any citizen\nwith full citizen rights) could bring a case since the issues in these major\nsuits were regarded as affecting the community as a whole.\n\nJustice was rapid: a case could last no longer than one day and \"completed by\nsunset\".[41] Some convictions triggered an automatic penalty, but where this\nwas not the case the two litigants each proposed a penalty for the convicted\ndefendant and the jury chose between them in a further vote.[42] No appeal was\npossible. There was however a mechanism for prosecuting the witnesses of a\nsuccessful prosecutor, which it appears could lead to the undoing of the\nearlier verdict.\n\nPayment for jurors was introduced around 462 BC and is ascribed to\n[Pericles](/wiki/Pericles \"Pericles\"), a feature described by Aristotle as\nfundamental to radical democracy (_Politics_ 1294a37). Pay was raised from 2\nto 3 [obols](/wiki/Obol_\\(coin\\) \"Obol \\(coin\\)\") by [Cleon](/wiki/Cleon\n\"Cleon\") early in the Peloponnesian war and there it stayed; the original\namount is not known. Notably, this was introduced more than fifty years before\npayment for attendance at assembly meetings. Running the courts was one of the\nmajor expenses of the Athenian state and there were moments of financial\ncrisis in the 4th century when the courts, at least for private suits, had to\nbe suspended.[43]\n\nThe system showed a marked anti-professionalism. No judges presided over the\ncourts nor did anyone give legal direction to the jurors; magistrates had only\nan administrative function and were laymen. Most of the annual magistracies at\nAthens could only be held once in a lifetime. There were no lawyers as such;\nlitigants acted solely in their capacity as citizens. Whatever professionalism\nthere was tended to disguise itself; it was possible to pay for the services\nof a speechwriter or [logographer](/wiki/Logographer_\\(legal\\) \"Logographer\n\\(legal\\)\") (_logographos_), but this may not have been advertised in court.\nProbably jurors would be more impressed if it seemed as though the litigant\nwere speaking for themselves.[44]\n\n### Shifting balance between assembly and\ncourts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Shifting balance between assembly and courts\")]\n\nAs the system evolved, the courts (that is, citizens under another guise)\nintruded upon the power of the assembly. From 355 BC political trials were no\nlonger held in the assembly, but only in a court. In 416 BC the _[graphē\nparanómōn](/wiki/Graph%C4%93_paran%C3%B3m%C5%8Dn \"Graphē paranómōn\")_\n(\"indictment against measures contrary to the laws\") was introduced. Under\nthis, anything passed by the assembly or even proposed but not yet voted on,\ncould be put on hold for review before a jury – which might annul it and\nperhaps punish the proposer as well.\n\nRemarkably, it seems that a measure blocked before the assembly voted on it\ndid not need to go back to the assembly if it survived the court challenge:\nthe court was enough to validate it. Once again it is important to bear in\nmind the lack of 'neutral' state intervention. To give a schematic scenario by\nway of illustration: two men have clashed in the assembly about a proposal put\nby one of them; it passed, and now the two of them go to court with the loser\nin the assembly prosecuting both the law and its proposer. The quantity of\nthese suits was enormous: in effect the courts became a kind of upper house.\n\nIn the 5th century there was in effect no procedural difference between an\nexecutive decree and a law: they were both simply passed by the assembly. But\nfrom 403 BC they were set sharply apart. Henceforth laws were made not in the\nassembly, but by special panels of citizens drawn from the annual jury pool of\n6000. They were known as the _nomothetai_ (νομοθέται), the lawmakers.[45]\n\n### Citizen-\ninitiator[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Citizen-initiator\")]\n\nThe institutions sketched above – assembly, officeholders, council, courts –\nare incomplete without the figure that drove the whole system, _Ho boulomenos_\n, he who wishes, or anyone who wishes. This expression encapsulated the right\nof citizens to take the initiative: to stand to speak in the assembly, to\ninitiate a public lawsuit (that is, one held to affect the political community\nas a whole), to propose a law before the lawmakers or to approach the council\nwith suggestions. Unlike officeholders, the citizen initiator was not voted\nbefore taking up office or automatically reviewed after stepping down — it had\nafter all no set tenure and might be an action lasting only a moment. But any\nstepping forward into the democratic limelight was risky and if someone chose\n(another citizen initiator) they could be called to account for their actions\nand punished. There were also other terms used for \"the persons who pleaded in\npublic actions and those who had initiated private suits. Although the\nexpression _ho diokon_ (literally 'the one who pursues') was applied to the\ninitiators of both public and private actions, the designations _kategoros_\n('accuser') ... were used only of prosecutors in public actions and in the\nactions for homicide heard by the Areiopagos and other homicide courts.\"[46]\n\n### Archons and the\nAreopagus[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Archons and the Areopagus\")]\n\nMain articles: [Archon](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\") and [Areopagus](/wiki/Areopagus\n\"Areopagus\")\n\nJust before the reforms of Solon in the 7th century BC, Athens was governed by\na few [archons](/wiki/Archon \"Archon\") (three rising to nine) and the council\nof the [Areopagus](/wiki/Areopagus \"Areopagus\") \"(appointed by the powerful\nnoble families from their own members)\". There also seems to have been a type\nof citizen assembly, presumably of the [hoplite](/wiki/Hoplite \"Hoplite\")\nclass. However, \"There seems little doubt that it was the arkhons, with the\nadvice of the Areopagos, who really ran the state.\" The mass of people had no\nsay in government at all.[47]\n\nSolon's reforms allowed the archons to come from some of the higher propertied\nclasses and not only from the aristocratic families. Since the Areopagus was\nmade up of ex-archons, this would eventually mean the weakening of the hold of\nthe nobles there as well. However, even with Solon's creation of the citizen's\nassembly, the Archons and Areopagus still wielded a great deal of power.[48]\n\nThe reforms of Cleisthenes meant that the archons were elected by the\nAssembly, but were still selected from the upper classes.[49] The Areopagus\nkept its power as 'Guardian of the Laws', \"which probably gave the Areopagos\nthe power to intervene and to apply a veto if the Council of 500 or the\nAssembly or any magistrate acted or proposed to act 'unconstitutionally'\",\nhowever this worked in practice.[50]\n\nEphialtes, and later [Pericles](/wiki/Pericles \"Pericles\"), reduced the power\nof the Areopagus dramatically. The Assembly \"passed a measure to limit the\npowers of the Areopagos, in effect stripping it of all its controlling and\nsupervisory powers.\" In the play _[The Eumenides](/wiki/The_Eumenides \"The\nEumenides\")_ , performed in 458, [Aeschylus](/wiki/Aeschylus \"Aeschylus\"),\nhimself a noble, portrays the Areopagus as a court established by Athena\nherself. It appears that Aeschylus \"is trying to preserve the dignity of a\nseverely battered institution.\"[10]\n\n###\nOfficeholders[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Officeholders\")]\n\nApproximately 1100 citizens (including the members of the council of 500) held\noffice each year. They were mostly chosen by [lot](/wiki/Sortition\n\"Sortition\"), with a much smaller (and more prestigious) group of about 100\n[elected](/wiki/Election \"Election\"). Neither was compulsory; individuals had\nto nominate themselves for both selection methods. In particular, those chosen\nby lot were citizens acting without particular expertise. This was almost\ninevitable since, with the notable exception of the generals\n([strategoi](/wiki/Strategoi \"Strategoi\")), each office could be held by the\nsame person only once. For example, \"The same person could not be a member of\nthe Boule in two consecutive years, and could only be a member twice in a\nlifetime.\"[51]\n\nPart of the ethos of democracy, however, was the building of general\ncompetence by ongoing involvement. In the 5th century version of the\ndemocracy, the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent, but\nfor those who had power, it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in\nthe respect accorded them in the assembly, rather than their vested powers.\n\nWhile citizens voting in the assembly _were_ the people and so were free of\nreview or punishment, those same citizens when holding an office _served_ the\npeople and could be punished very severely. All of them were subject to a\nreview beforehand that might disqualify them for office and an examination\nafter stepping down. Officeholders were the agents of the people, not their\nrepresentatives. Citizens active as office holders served in a quite different\ncapacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors.\n\nThe assembly and the courts were regarded as the instantiation of the people\nof Athens: they were the people, no power was above them and they could not be\nreviewed, impeached or punished. However, when an Athenian took up an office,\nhe was regarded as 'serving' the people. As such, he could be regarded as\nfailing in his duty and be punished for it.\n\nThere were in fact some limitations on who could hold office. Age restrictions\nwere in place with thirty years as a minimum, rendering about a third of the\nadult citizen body ineligible at any one time. An unknown proportion of\ncitizens were also subject to disenfranchisement\n([atimia](/wiki/Atimia_\\(loss_of_citizen_rights\\) \"Atimia \\(loss of citizen\nrights\\)\")), excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily\n(depending on the type). Furthermore, all citizens selected were reviewed\nbefore taking up office (_dokimasia_) at which they might be disqualified.\n\nCompetence does not seem to have been the main issue, but rather, at least in\nthe 4th century BC, whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic\ntendencies. However, magistrates, after leaving office were subject to a\nscrutiny (_euthunai_ , literally 'straightenings' or 'submission of accounts')\nto review their performance. Both of these processes were in most cases brief\nand formulaic, but they opened up in the possibility, if some citizen wanted\nto take some matter up, of a contest before a jury court.[52]\n\nIn the case of a scrutiny going to trial, there was the risk for the former\nofficeholder of suffering severe penalties. Finally, even during his period of\noffice, any officeholder could be impeached and removed from office by the\nassembly. In each of the ten \"main meetings\" (_kuriai ekklesiai_) a year, the\nquestion was explicitly raised in the assembly agenda: were the office holders\ncarrying out their duties correctly?\n\nBy and large the power exercised by these officials was routine administration\nand quite limited. The powers of officials were precisely defined and their\ncapacity for initiative limited. They administered rather than governed. When\nit came to penal sanctions, no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty\ndrachmas. Anything higher had to go before a court.\n\n#### Selection by lot (sortition /\nallotment)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Selection by lot \\(sortition / allotment\\)\")]\n\nThe use of a lottery to select officeholders was regarded as the most\ndemocratic means: elections would favour those who were rich, noble, eloquent\nand well-known, while [allotment](/wiki/Sortition \"Sortition\") spread the work\nof administration throughout the whole citizen body, engaging them in the\ncrucial democratic experience of, to use Aristotle's words, \"ruling and being\nruled in turn\" (Politics 1317b28–30). The allotment of an individual was based\non citizenship rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which\ncould be bought. Allotment therefore was seen as a means to prevent the\ncorrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens a unique form of political\nequality as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office. Samons\nwrites that \"the system of selection by lottery for members of the Council of\n500 and other officials (like the treasurers of the sacred funds) provided a\npotentially significant check on the dangers of\n[demagoguery](/wiki/Demagoguery \"Demagoguery\").\" However, this may not have\nbeen completely successful, as some \"increasingly pandered to the electorate\nand ... often told the people only what they wanted to hear.\"[53]\n\nThe random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be\ncompetent has obvious risks, but the system included features meant to obviate\npossible problems. Athenians selected for office served as teams (boards,\npanels). In a group someone will know the right way to do things and those\nthat do not may learn from those that do. During the period of holding a\nparticular office everyone on the team is observing everybody else. There were\nhowever officials such as the nine archons, who while seemingly a board\ncarried out very different functions from each other.\n\nNo office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual. The\nonly exception was the boule or council of 500. In this case, simply by\ndemographic necessity, an individual could serve twice in a lifetime. This\nprinciple extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as\nassistants to magistrates such as the archons. To the Athenians it seems what\nhad to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use office\nas a way of accumulating ongoing power.[54]\n\n####\nElection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Election\")]\n\nDuring an Athenian election, approximately one hundred officials out of a\nthousand were elected rather than chosen by lot. There were two main\ncategories in this group: those required to handle large sums of money, and\nthe 10 generals, the _[strategoi](/wiki/Strategoi \"Strategoi\")_. One reason\nthat financial officials were elected was that any money\n[embezzled](/wiki/Embezzlement \"Embezzlement\") could be recovered from their\nestates; election in general strongly favoured the rich, but in this case\nwealth was virtually a prerequisite.\n\nGenerals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge\nbut also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the\nwider Greek world where wars were fought. In the 5th century BC, principally\nas seen through the figure of [Pericles](/wiki/Pericles \"Pericles\"), the\ngenerals could be among the most powerful people in the pols. Yet in the case\nof Pericles, it is wrong to see his power as coming from his long series of\nannual generalships (each year along with nine others). His office holding was\nrather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded. That influence\nwas based on his relation with the assembly, a relation that in the first\ninstance lay simply in the right of any citizen to stand and speak before the\npeople. Under the 4th century version of democracy the roles of general and of\nkey political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different\npersons. In part this was a consequence of the increasingly specialized forms\nof warfare practiced in the later period.\n\nElected officials too were subject to review before holding office and\nscrutiny after office. And they too could be removed from office at any time\nthat the assembly met. There was also a death penalty for \"inadequate\nperformance\" while in office.[55]\n\n## Individualism in Athenian\ndemocracy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Individualism in Athenian democracy\")]\n\nA good example of the contempt the first democrats felt for those who did not\nparticipate in politics can be found in the modern word 'idiot', which finds\nits origins in the ancient Greek word ἰδιώτης, _idiōtēs_ , meaning a private\nperson, a person who is not actively interested in politics;[56] such\ncharacters were talked about with contempt, and the word eventually acquired\nits modern meaning. According to Thucydides, Pericles may have declared in a\nfuneral oration:\n\n> We do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who\n> minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all.[57]\n\n## Criticism of the\ndemocracy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Criticism of the democracy\")]\n\nMain article: [Slavery in ancient Greece](/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Greece\n\"Slavery in ancient Greece\")\n\nAthenian democracy has had many critics, both ancient and modern. Ancient\nGreek critics of the democracy include [Thucydides](/wiki/Thucydides\n\"Thucydides\") the general and historian, [Aristophanes](/wiki/Aristophanes\n\"Aristophanes\") the playwright, [Plato](/wiki/Plato \"Plato\") the pupil of\nSocrates, [Aristotle](/wiki/Aristotle \"Aristotle\") the pupil of Plato, and a\nwriter known as the [Old Oligarch](/wiki/Old_Oligarch \"Old Oligarch\"). Modern\ncritics are more likely to find fault with the narrow definition of the\ncitizen body, but in the ancient world the complaint, if anything, went in the\nopposite direction. For them, the common people were not necessarily the right\npeople to rule and made huge mistakes. According to Samons:\n\n> The modern desire to look to Athens for lessons or encouragement for modern\n> thought, government, or society must confront this strange paradox: the\n> people that gave rise to and practiced ancient democracy left us almost\n> nothing but criticism of this form of regime (on a philosophical or\n> theoretical level). And what is more, the actual history of Athens in the\n> period of its democratic government is marked by numerous failures,\n> mistakes, and misdeeds—most infamously, the execution of Socrates—that would\n> seem to discredit the ubiquitous modern idea that democracy leads to good\n> government.[58]\n\nThucydides, from his Aristocratic and historical viewpoint, reasoned that the\ncommon people were often much too credulous about even contemporary facts to\nrule justly. [Josiah Ober](/wiki/Josiah_Ober \"Josiah Ober\") notes that\n\"Thucydides cites examples of two errors regarding [Sparta](/wiki/Sparta\n\"Sparta\"): the beliefs that the two Spartan kings each had two votes in\ncouncil and that there was a Spartan battalion called the 'Pitanate _lochos_.'\nThucydides sums up: 'Such is the degree of carelessness among the many (_[hoi\npolloi](/wiki/Hoi_polloi \"Hoi polloi\")_) in the search for truth\n(_[aletheia](/wiki/Aletheia \"Aletheia\")_) and their preference for ready-made\naccounts'.\" He contrasted his own critical-historical approach to history with\nthe way the demos decided upon the truth. So \"Thucydides has established for\nhis reader the existence of a potentially fatal structural flaw in the edifice\nof democratic ways of knowing and doing. The identification of this \"flaw\" is\na key to his criticism of Athenian popular rule.\"[59]\n\nAlso, [Donald Kagan](/wiki/Donald_Kagan \"Donald Kagan\") writes that \"In the\nfourth century, Plato and Aristotle must have been repeating old complaints\nwhen they pointed out the unfairness of democracy: 'it distributes a sort of\nequality to equal and unequal alike'.\"[60] Instead of seeing it as a fair\nsystem under which 'everyone' has equal rights, the critics saw it as the\nnumerically preponderant poor tyrannizing the rich. They regarded this as\nmanifestly unjust. In Aristotle this is categorized as the difference between\n'arithmetic' and 'geometric' (i.e. proportional) equality.\n\nTo its ancient detractors rule by the _demos_ was also reckless and arbitrary.\nTwo examples demonstrate this:\n\n  * In 406 BC, after years of defeats in the wake of the annihilation of their vast invasion force in Sicily, the Athenians at last won a naval victory at [Arginusae](/wiki/Battle_of_Arginusae \"Battle of Arginusae\") over the Spartans. After the battle a storm arose and the [generals](/wiki/Strategos \"Strategos\") in command failed to collect survivors: the Athenians tried and sentenced six of the eight generals to death. Technically, it was illegal, as the generals were tried and sentenced together, rather than one by one as Athenian law required. [Socrates](/wiki/Socrates \"Socrates\") happened to be the citizen presiding over the assembly that day and refused to cooperate (though to little effect) and stood against the idea that it was outrageous for the people to be unable to do whatever they wanted. Later, \"the demos is reported to have regretted what had happened ... They decided that those who had misled the demos should be charged and put on trial, including [the] author of the motion by which the generals were tried and condemned en masse in the Assembly. This passage is often interpreted as a confession of collective regret and guilt on the part of the demos, once their anger gave way to second thoughts.\"[61]\n  * In 399 BC [Socrates](/wiki/Socrates \"Socrates\") was put on trial and executed for 'corrupting the young and believing in strange gods'. His death gave Europe one of the first intellectual martyrs still recorded, but guaranteed the democracy an eternity of bad press at the hands of his disciple and enemy to democracy [Plato](/wiki/Plato \"Plato\"). From Socrates' arguments at his trial, Loren Samons writes, \"It follows, of course, that any majority—including the majority of jurors—is unlikely to choose rightly.\" However, \"some might argue, Athens is the only state that can claim to have produced a Socrates. Surely, some might continue, we may simply write off events such as Socrates' execution as examples of the Athenians' failure to realize fully the meaning and potential of their own democracy.\"[62]\n\nWhile Plato blamed democracy for killing Socrates, his criticisms of the rule\nof the demos were much more extensive. Much of his writings were about his\nalternatives to democracy. His _[The Republic](/wiki/The_Republic_\\(Plato\\)\n\"The Republic \\(Plato\\)\")_ , _[The Statesman](/wiki/Statesman_\\(dialogue\\)\n\"Statesman \\(dialogue\\)\")_ and _[Laws](/wiki/Laws_\\(dialogue\\) \"Laws\n\\(dialogue\\)\")_ contained many arguments against democratic rule and in favour\nof a much narrower form of government: \"The organization of the city must be\nconfided to those who possess knowledge, who alone can enable their fellow-\ncitizens to attain virtue, and therefore excellence, by means of\neducation.\"[63]\n\nWhether the democratic failures should be seen as systemic, or as a product of\nthe extreme conditions of the Peloponnesian war, there does seem to have been\na move toward correction. A new version of democracy was established from 403\nBC, but it can be linked with both earlier and subsequent reforms ([graphē\nparanómōn](/wiki/Graph%C4%93_paran%C3%B3m%C5%8Dn \"Graphē paranómōn\") 416 BC;\nend of assembly trials 355 BC). For instance, the system of _nomothesia_ was\nintroduced. In this:\n\n> A new law might be proposed by any citizen. Any proposal to modify an\n> existing law had to be accompanied by a proposed replacement law. The\n> citizen making the proposal had to publish it [in] advance: publication\n> consisted of writing the proposal on a whitened board located next to the\n> statues of the Eponymous Heroes in the agora. The proposal would be\n> considered by the Council, and would be placed on the agenda of the Assembly\n> in the form of a motion. If the Assembly voted in favor of the proposed\n> change, the proposal would be referred for further consideration by a group\n> of citizens called nomothetai (literally \"establishers of the law\").[18]\n\nIncreasingly, responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts, with\nlaws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by\ncourts. That is to say, the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to\ngatherings of a thousand or so which were under oath, and with more time to\nfocus on just one matter (though never more than a day). One downside was that\nthe new democracy was less capable of rapid response.\n\nAnother tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy\nand a number of less than appealing features of Athenian life. Although\ndemocracy predated Athenian imperialism by over thirty years, they are\nsometimes associated with each other. For much of the 5th century at least\ndemocracy fed off an empire of subject states.\n[Thucydides](/wiki/Thucydides_\\(politician\\) \"Thucydides \\(politician\\)\") the\nson of Milesias (not the historian), an aristocrat, stood in opposition to\nthese policies, for which he was ostracised in 443 BC.\n\nAt times the imperialist democracy acted with extreme brutality, as in the\ndecision to execute the entire male population of [Melos](/wiki/Melos \"Melos\")\nand sell off its women and children simply for refusing to become subjects of\nAthens. The common people were numerically dominant in the navy, which they\nused to pursue their own interests in the form of work as rowers and in the\nhundreds of overseas administrative positions. Further they used the income\nfrom empire to fund payment for officeholding. This is the position set out by\nthe anti-democratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the\n[Old Oligarch](/wiki/Old_Oligarch \"Old Oligarch\"). This writer (also called\npseudo-Xenophon) produced several comments critical of democracy, such as:\n\n> 1\\. Democracy is not the rule of the demos qua citizenship in the interest\n> of the entire polis, but the self-interested rule of a sociological faction.\n> 2. The collectivization of political responsibility for decisions and\n> agreements in a democracy leads to dishonesty and the tendency to scapegoat\n> individual speakers or magistrates. 3. Because it is an integrated system,\n> democracy seems incapable of internal amelioration, yet because of its\n> inclusivist tendencies, especially in regard to citizenship, it coopts its\n> natural enemies and so generates few active opponents. 4. There is a strong\n> relationship between a democracy's domestic and foreign policies; a rational\n> imperial democracy will be likely to foment democracy among its subjects. 5.\n> Democracy depends on naval power; naval power in turn depends on the control\n> of capital resources; ergo a democracy will tend to be aggressively\n> acquisitive. 6. Democracy's core values of freedom and equality are not\n> exclusive to the citizen population; noncitizens are also treated more\n> equitably than is seemly. 7. Democracy tends to blur the distinction between\n> nature and political culture, thereby blinding elites to their own best\n> interests and luring them into immorality.[64]\n\nAristotle also wrote about what he considered to be a better form of\ngovernment than democracy. Rather than any citizen partaking with equal share\nin the rule, he thought that \"Virtue understood as embracing courage and\ntemperance and prudence as well as justice turns out to be the chief\ndeterminant for shares in rule. Those who are superior in virtue should\nreceive greater shares in rule.\"[65]\n\nA case can be made that discriminatory lines came to be drawn more sharply\nunder Athenian democracy than before or elsewhere, in particular in relation\nto women and slaves, as well as in the line between citizens and non-citizens.\nBy so strongly validating one role, that of the male citizen, it has been\nargued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it.\n\n  * Originally, a male would be a citizen if his father was a citizen, Under [Pericles](/wiki/Pericles \"Pericles\"), in 450 BC, restrictions were tightened so that a citizen had to be born to an Athenian father and an Athenian mother. So _Metroxenoi_ , those with foreign mothers, were now to be excluded. Also, \"at least by Demosthenes' time, mixed marriages were actually heavily penalized.\" Many Athenians prominent earlier in the century would have lost citizenship, had this law applied to them: [Cleisthenes](/wiki/Cleisthenes \"Cleisthenes\"), the founder of democracy, had a non-Athenian mother, and the mothers of [Cimon](/wiki/Cimon \"Cimon\") and [Themistocles](/wiki/Themistocles \"Themistocles\") were not Greek at all, but [Thracian](/wiki/Thrace \"Thrace\").[66]\n  * Likewise the status of women seems lower in Athens than in many Greek cities. At Sparta women competed in public exercise – so in [Aristophanes](/wiki/Aristophanes \"Aristophanes\")' _Lysistrata_ the Athenian women admire the tanned, muscular bodies of their Spartan counterparts – and women could own property in their own right, as they could not at Athens. [Misogyny](/wiki/Misogyny \"Misogyny\") was by no means an Athenian invention, but it has been claimed that in regard to the position of women, it \"was worse in Athens than in other states\".[67] Yet democracy may well have been impossible without the contribution of women's labour (Hansen 1987: 318).\n  * [Slavery](/wiki/Slavery_in_antiquity \"Slavery in antiquity\") was more widespread at Athens than in other Greek cities. Indeed, the extensive use of imported non-Greeks (\"[barbarians](/wiki/Barbarian \"Barbarian\")\") as [chattel slaves](/wiki/Chattel_slavery \"Chattel slavery\") seems to have been an Athenian development. This triggers the paradoxical question: Was democracy \"based on\" slavery? It does seem clear that possession of slaves allowed even poorer Athenians — owning a few slaves was by no means equated with wealth — to devote more of their time to political life.[68] But whether democracy depended on this extra time is impossible to say. The breadth of slave ownership also meant that the leisure of the rich (the small minority who were actually free of the need to work) rested less than it would have on the exploitation of their less well-off fellow citizens. Working for wages was clearly regarded as subjection to the will of another, but at least debt servitude had been abolished at Athens (under the reforms of Solon at the start of the 6th century BC). By allowing a new kind of equality among citizens this opened the way to democracy, which in turn called for a new means, chattel slavery, to at least partially equalise the availability of leisure between rich and poor. In the absence of reliable statistics all these connections remain speculative. However, as [Cornelius Castoriadis](/wiki/Cornelius_Castoriadis \"Cornelius Castoriadis\") pointed out, other societies also kept slaves but did not develop democracy. Even with respect to slavery the new citizen law of 450 BC might have had effect: it is speculated that originally Athenian fathers had been able to register for citizenship offspring conceived with slave women.[66]\n\nSince the 19th century, the Athenian version of democracy has been seen by one\ngroup as a goal yet to be achieved by modern societies. They want\n[representative democracy](/wiki/Representative_democracy \"Representative\ndemocracy\") to be added to or even replaced by [direct\ndemocracy](/wiki/Direct_democracy \"Direct democracy\") in the Athenian way,\nperhaps by utilizing [electronic democracy](/wiki/Electronic_democracy\n\"Electronic democracy\"). Another group, on the other hand, considers that,\nsince many Athenians were not allowed to participate in its government,\nAthenian democracy was not a democracy at all. \"[C]omparisons with Athens will\ncontinue to be made as long as societies keep striving to realize democracy\nunder modern conditions and their successes and failures are discussed.\"[69]\n\n## Legacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Athenian_democracy&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Legacy\")]\n\nSince the middle of the 20th century, most countries have claimed to be a\ndemocracy, regardless of the actual makeup of its government. Yet, after the\ndemise of Athenian democracy, few looked upon it as a good form of government.\nThis was because no legitimation of that rule was formulated to counter the\nnegative accounts of Plato and Aristotle. They saw it as the rule of the poor\nthat plundered the rich, and so democracy was viewed as a sort of \"collective\ntyranny\". \"Well into the 18th century democracy was consistently condemned.\"\nSometimes, mixed constitutions evolved with a democratic element, but \"it\ndefinitely did not mean self-rule by citizens.\"[70]\n\nIn the age of [Cicero](/wiki/Cicero \"Cicero\") and [Caesar](/wiki/Caesar\n\"Caesar\"), Rome was a republic, but not a democracy. Furthermore, it would be\nmisleading to say that the tradition of Athenian democracy was an important\npart of the 18th-century revolutionaries' intellectual background. The\nclassical example that inspired the American and French revolutionaries as\nwell as the English radicals was Rome rather than Greece. Thus, the [Founding\nFathers](/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States \"Founding Fathers of the\nUnited States\") who met in Philadelphia in 1787, did not set up a Council of\nthe Areopagos, but a [Senate](/wiki/Senate \"Senate\"), that, eventually, met on\nthe [Capitol](/wiki/United_States_Capitol \"United States Capitol\").[71]\nFollowing [Rousseau](/wiki/Rousseau \"Rousseau\") (1712–1778), \"democracy came\nto be associated with popular sovereignty instead of popular participation in\nthe exercise of power.\"\n\nSeveral German philosophers and poets took delight in the fullness of life in\nAthens, and not long afterwards \"the English liberals put forward a new\nargument in favor of the Athenians\". In opposition, thinkers such as [Samuel\nJohnson](/wiki/Samuel_Johnson \"Samuel Johnson\") were worried about the\nignorance of a democratic decision-making body. However,\n\"[Macaulay](/wiki/Thomas_Babington_Macaulay,_1st_Baron_Macaulay \"Thomas\nBabington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay\") and [John Stuart\nMill](/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill \"John Stuart Mill\") and [George\nGrote](/wiki/George_Grote \"George Grote\") saw the great strength of the\nAthenian democracy in the high level of cultivation that citizens enjoyed and\ncalled for improvements in the educational system of Britain that would make\npossible a shared civic consciousness parallel to that achieved by the ancient\nAthenians.\"[72]\n\nTherefore, it was George Grote, in his _History of Greece_ (1846–1856), who\nwould claim that \"Athenian democracy was neither the tyranny of the poor, nor\nthe rule of the mob.\" He argued that only by giving every citizen the vote\nwould people ensure that the state would be run in the general interest.\nLater, to the end of World War Il, democracy became dissociated from its\nancient frame of reference. It was not anymore only one of the many possible\nways in which political rule could be organised in a polity: it became the\nonly possible political system in an egalitarian society.
