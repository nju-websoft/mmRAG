In\nthis twelve-year span, [Kevin Garnett](/wiki/Kevin_Garnett \"Kevin Garnett\")\nreceived $28,000,000, which was the highest salary payment of any NBA player,\nduring the [2003–04 season](/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_NBA_season \"2003–04 NBA\nseason\"). Garnett has been the highest-paid [NBA](/wiki/NBA \"NBA\") player per\nyear in seven of the past twelve NBA seasons. [Michael\nJordan](/wiki/Michael_Jordan \"Michael Jordan\") was the first NBA player to\nsign a contract worth over thirty million dollars in a season. During the\n[1997–98 season](/wiki/1997%E2%80%9398_NBA_season \"1997–98 NBA season\"),\nJordan earned $33,000,000. [Kobe Bryant](/wiki/Kobe_Bryant \"Kobe Bryant\")\nbecome just the second player to reach this milestone when the [2013–14\nseason](/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_NBA_season \"2013–14 NBA season\") began.[1]\n[LeBron James](/wiki/LeBron_James \"LeBron James\") became the third in the\n[2016–17 season](/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_NBA_season \"2016–17 NBA season\").\n[Stephen Curry](/wiki/Stephen_Curry \"Stephen Curry\") became the first player\nto eclipse $40-Million per year when he signed a record 5-year contract worth\n$201-Million in 2017.\n\nBeginning in the [1984–85 NBA season](/wiki/1984%E2%80%9385_NBA_season\n\"1984–85 NBA season\"), the NBA's first salary cap was introduced. The [NBA\nsalary cap](/wiki/NBA_salary_cap \"NBA salary cap\") is the maximum dollar\namount each NBA team can spend on its players for the season. However, the NBA\nuses a \"soft\" salary cap, which means that significant \"salary exceptions\"\nallow NBA teams to exceed their allotted amount in order to sign players. The\nsalary cap is determined during the [offseason](/wiki/Offseason \"Offseason\"),\nbut as stated earlier, it is liable to change.[2]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Jordan_by_Lipofsky_16577.jpg/225px-\nJordan_by_Lipofsky_16577.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jordan_by_Lipofsky_16577.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jordan_by_Lipofsky_16577.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Michael Jordan](/wiki/Michael_Jordan \"Michael Jordan\"), who earned\n$33,000,000 in the [1997–98 NBA season](/wiki/1997%E2%80%9398_NBA_season\n\"1997–98 NBA season\"), attempts a [slam dunk](/wiki/Slam_dunk \"Slam dunk\") at\nthe old [Boston Garden](/wiki/Boston_Garden \"Boston Garden\").\n\nAn exception is necessary to sign a player for a contract that would exceed\nthe salary cap threshold of the \"soft cap\". The [Larry Bird\nexception](/wiki/Larry_Bird_exception \"Larry Bird exception\"), more commonly\nknown as Bird Rights, allows teams to re-sign a current player only if he has\nplayed for that particular team for a minimum of three years.[3] Another\nexception known as the mid-level exception allows for teams that are over the\nsalary cap to sign one or more players as long as they do not exceed the total\namount of the average NBA salary.[4] Next, the bi-annual exception can be used\nby teams every other year to sign a free agent(s) for up to two years at an\namount set by the NBA.[5] Finally, the rookie player exception allows any NBA\nteam to sign their first-round draft pick to a contract based upon a scale\npreviously set forth by the NBA. Another option for teams would be to assign\nplayers to a league-assigned minimum salary contract for a maximum of two\nyears.\n\nAccording to [2010–11 NBA season](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_NBA_season \"2010–11\nNBA season\") game performance, the league's best players were not its highest-\npaid players. Each year there are ten players selected to one of the two [All-\nNBA Teams](/wiki/All-NBA_Team \"All-NBA Team\"). Out of those ten players chosen\nthat year, [Kobe Bryant](/wiki/Kobe_Bryant \"Kobe Bryant\") was the only player\nthat was also among the game's ten highest-paid during the 2010–11 NBA\nseason.[6]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 2010s\n    * 1.1 2017–2018\n    * 1.2 2016–2017\n    * 1.3 2015–2016\n    * 1.4 2014–2015\n    * 1.5 2013–2014\n    * 1.6 2012–2013\n    * 1.7
