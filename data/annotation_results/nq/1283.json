This line of demarcation was about halfway between the\nCape Verde islands (already Portuguese) and the islands entered by\n[Christopher Columbus](/wiki/Christopher_Columbus \"Christopher Columbus\") on\nhis first voyage (claimed for Castile and León), named in the treaty as\n[Cipangu](/wiki/Names_of_Japan \"Names of Japan\") and [Antilia](/wiki/Antilia\n\"Antilia\") (Cuba and [Hispaniola](/wiki/Hispaniola \"Hispaniola\")).\n\nThe lands to the east would belong to Portugal and the lands to the west to\nCastile. The treaty was signed by Spain, 2 July 1494 and by Portugal, 5\nSeptember 1494. The other side of the world was divided a few decades later by\nthe [Treaty of Zaragoza](/wiki/Treaty_of_Zaragoza \"Treaty of Zaragoza\"),\nsigned on 22 April 1529, which specified the antimeridian to the line of\ndemarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.

Those countries generally ignored\nthe treaty, particularly those that became Protestant after the [Protestant\nReformation](/wiki/Protestant_Reformation \"Protestant Reformation\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Signing and enforcement\n  * 2 Tordesillas meridian\n  * 3 Antimeridian: Moluccas and Treaty of Zaragoza\n  * 4 Effect on other European powers\n  * 5 The Treaty of Madrid\n  * 6 Modern claims\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 References\n    * 9.1 Citations\n    * 9.2 Bibliography\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Signing and\nenforcement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Treaty_of_Tordesillas&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Signing and enforcement\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Spain_and_Portugal.png/400px-\nSpain_and_Portugal.png)](/wiki/File:Spain_and_Portugal.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Spain_and_Portugal.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nLines dividing the non-Christian world between Castile and Portugal: the 1494\nTordesillas meridian (purple) and the 1529 Zaragoza antimeridian (green)\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas was intended to solve the dispute that had been\ncreated following the return of Christopher Columbus and his crew, who had\nsailed for the Crown of Castile. On his way back to Spain he first reached\nLisbon, in Portugal. There he asked for another meeting with [King John\nII](/wiki/John_II_of_Portugal \"John II of Portugal\") to show him the newly\ndiscovered lands.\n\nAfter learning of the Castilian-sponsored voyage, the Portuguese King sent a\nthreatening letter to the [Catholic Monarchs](/wiki/Catholic_Monarchs\n\"Catholic Monarchs\") stating that by the [Treaty of\nAlcáçovas](/wiki/Treaty_of_Alc%C3%A1%C3%A7ovas \"Treaty of Alcáçovas\") signed\nin 1479 and confirmed in 1481 with the [papal bull](/wiki/Papal_bull \"Papal\nbull\") _[Æterni regis](/wiki/%C3%86terni_regis \"Æterni regis\")_ , that granted\nall lands south of the [Canary Islands](/wiki/Canary_Islands \"Canary Islands\")\nto Portugal, all of the lands discovered by Columbus belonged, in fact, to\nPortugal. Also, the Portuguese King stated that he was already making\narrangements for a fleet (an armada led by [Francisco de\nAlmeida](/wiki/Francisco_de_Almeida \"Francisco de Almeida\")) to depart shortly\nand take possession of the new lands.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] After\nreading the letter the Catholic Monarchs knew they did not have any military\npower in the Atlantic to match the Portuguese, so they pursued a diplomatic\nway out.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] On 4 May 1493 [Pope Alexander\nVI](/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI \"Pope Alexander VI\") ([Rodrigo\nBorgia](/wiki/Rodrigo_Borgia \"Rodrigo Borgia\")), an\n[Aragonese](/wiki/Crown_of_Aragon \"Crown of Aragon\") from\n[Valencia](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Valencia \"Kingdom of Valencia\") by birth, decreed\nin the bull _[Inter caetera](/wiki/Inter_caetera \"Inter caetera\")_ that all\nlands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of any\nof the islands of the [Azores](/wiki/Azores \"Azores\") or the Cape Verde\nIslands should belong to Castile, although territory under Catholic rule as of\nChristmas 1492 would remain untouched.[9] The bull did not mention Portugal or\nits lands, so Portugal could not claim newly discovered lands even if they\nwere east of the line. Another bull, _[Dudum siquidem](/wiki/Dudum_siquidem\n\"Dudum siquidem\")_ , entitled _Extension of the Apostolic Grant and Donation\nof the Indies_ and dated 25 September 1493, gave all mainlands and islands,\n\"at one time or even still belonging to India\" to Spain, even if east of the\nline.[10]\n\nThe Portuguese King John II was not pleased with that arrangement, feeling\nthat it gave him far too little land—it prevented him from possessing India,\nhis near term goal.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] By 1493 Portuguese explorers had reached the\nsouthern tip of Africa, the [Cape of Good Hope](/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope \"Cape\nof Good Hope\"). The Portuguese were unlikely to go to war over the islands\nencountered by Columbus, but the explicit mention of India was a major issue.\nAs the Pope had not made changes, the Portuguese king opened direct\nnegotiations with the Catholic Monarchs, King\n[Ferdinand](/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon \"Ferdinand II of Aragon\") and Queen\n[Isabella](/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile \"Isabella I of Castile\"), to move the\nline to the west and allow him to claim newly discovered lands east of the\nline. In the bargain, John accepted _[Inter caetera](/wiki/Inter_caetera\n\"Inter caetera\")_ as the starting point of discussion with Ferdinand and\nIsabella, but had the boundary line moved 270 leagues west, protecting the\nPortuguese route down the coast of Africa and giving the Portuguese rights to\nlands that now constitute the Eastern quarter of Brazil. As one scholar\nassessed the results, \"both sides must have known that so vague a boundary\ncould not be accurately fixed, and each thought that the other was deceived,\n[concluding that it was a] diplomatic triumph for Portugal, confirming to the\nPortuguese not only the true route to India, but most of the South\nAtlantic\".[11]\n\nThe treaty effectively countered the bulls of Alexander VI but was\nsubsequently sanctioned by [Pope Julius II](/wiki/Pope_Julius_II \"Pope Julius\nII\") by means of the bull _Ea quae pro bono pacis_ of 24 January 1506.[12]\nEven though the treaty was negotiated without consulting the Pope, a few\nsources call the resulting line the \"Papal Line of Demarcation\".[13]\n\nVery little of the newly divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as\nit was only divided via the treaty. Castile gained lands including most of the\nAmericas, which in 1494 had little proven wealth. The easternmost part of\ncurrent Brazil was granted to Portugal when in 1500 [Pedro Álvares\nCabral](/wiki/Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral \"Pedro Álvares Cabral\") landed there\nwhile he was en route to India. Some historians contend that the Portuguese\nalready knew of the South American bulge that makes up most of Brazil before\nthis time, so his landing in Brazil was not an accident.[14] One scholar\npoints to Cabral's landing on the Brazilian coast 12 degrees farther south\nthan the expected [Cape São Roque](/wiki/Cape_S%C3%A3o_Roque \"Cape São\nRoque\"), such that \"the likelihood of making such a landfall as a result of\nfreak weather or navigational error was remote; and it is highly probable that\nCabral had been instructed to investigate a coast whose existence was not\nmerely suspected, but already known\".[15]\n\nThe line was not strictly enforced—the Spanish did not resist the [Portuguese\nexpansion of Brazil](/wiki/Portuguese_colonization_of_the_Americas \"Portuguese\ncolonization of the Americas\") across the meridian. However, the Catholic\nMonarchs attempted to stop the Portuguese advance in Asia, by claiming the\nmeridian line ran around the world, dividing the whole world in half rather\nthan just the Atlantic. Portugal pushed back, seeking another papal\npronouncement that limited the line of demarcation to the Atlantic. This was\ngiven by Pope [Leo X](/wiki/Leo_X \"Leo X\"), who was friendly toward Portugal\nand its discoveries, in 1514 in the bull _Praecelsae devotionis_.[16]\n\nFor a period between 1580 and 1640, the treaty was rendered meaningless, as\nthe Spanish King was also King of Portugal. It was superseded by the [1750\nTreaty of Madrid](/wiki/Treaty_of_Madrid_\\(13_January_1750\\) \"Treaty of Madrid\n\\(13 January 1750\\)\") which granted Portugal control of the lands it occupied\nin South America. However, the latter treaty was immediately repudiated by the\nCatholic Monarch. The [First Treaty of San\nIldefonso](/wiki/First_Treaty_of_San_Ildefonso \"First Treaty of San\nIldefonso\") settled the problem, with Spain acquiring territories east of the\n[Uruguay River](/wiki/Uruguay_River \"Uruguay River\") and Portugal acquiring\nterritories in the [Amazon Basin](/wiki/Amazon_Basin \"Amazon Basin\"). Emerging\nProtestant maritime powers, particularly England and The Netherlands, and\nother third parties such as Roman Catholic France, did not recognize the\ndivision of the world between only two Roman Catholic nations brokered by the\npope.[17]\n\n## Tordesillas\nmeridian[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Treaty_of_Tordesillas&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Tordesillas meridian\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Early_Tordesillas_lines.jpg/330px-\nEarly_Tordesillas_lines.jpg)](/wiki/File:Early_Tordesillas_lines.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Early_Tordesillas_lines.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nEarly Tordesillas lines in South America (1495–1545)\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas only specified the line of demarcation in leagues\nfrom the Cape Verde Islands. It did not specify the line in degrees, nor did\nit identify the specific island or the specific length of its league. Instead,\nthe treaty stated that these matters were to be settled by a joint voyage\nwhich never occurred. The number of degrees can be determined via a ratio of\nmarine leagues to degrees applied to the Earth regardless of its assumed size,\nor via a specific marine league applied to the true size of the Earth, called\n\"our sphere\" by historian [Henry Harrisse](/wiki/Henry_Harrisse \"Henry\nHarrisse\").[18]\n\n  * The earliest Aragonese opinion was provided by Jaime Ferrer in 1495 at the request of the Aragonese king and Castilian queen to those monarchs. He stated that the demarcation line was 18° west of the most central island of the Cape Verde Islands, which is [Fogo](/wiki/Fogo,_Cape_Verde \"Fogo, Cape Verde\") according to Harrisse, having a longitude of 24°25'W of [Greenwich](/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich \"Royal Observatory, Greenwich\"), hence Ferrer placed the line at 42°25'W on his sphere, which was 21.1% larger than our sphere. Ferrer also stated that his league contained 32 Olympic [stades](/wiki/Stadion_\\(unit_of_length\\) \"Stadion \\(unit of length\\)\"), or 6.15264 km according to Harrisse, thus Ferrer's line was 2,276.5 km west of Fogo at 47°37'W on our sphere.[19]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/CantinoPlanisphere.png/330px-\nCantinoPlanisphere.png)](/wiki/File:CantinoPlanisphere.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:CantinoPlanisphere.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Cantino planisphere](/wiki/Cantino_planisphere \"Cantino planisphere\")\ndepicting the meridian, 1502\n\n  * The earliest surviving Portuguese opinion is on the [Cantino planisphere](/wiki/Cantino_planisphere \"Cantino planisphere\") of 1502. Because its demarcation line was midway between Cape Saint Roque (northeast cape of South America) and the mouth of the [Amazon River](/wiki/Amazon_River \"Amazon River\") (its estuary is marked _Todo este mar he de agua doçe—_ \"All of this sea is fresh water\"—and its river is marked _Rio grande_ , \"great river\"), Harrisse concluded that the line was at 42°30'W on our sphere. Harrisse believed the large estuary just west of the line on the Cantino map was that of the Rio Maranhão (this estuary is now the [Baía de São Marcos](/wiki/Ba%C3%ADa_de_S%C3%A3o_Marcos \"Baía de São Marcos\") and the river is now the [Mearim](/wiki/Mearim_River \"Mearim River\")), whose flow is so weak that its gulf does _not_ contain fresh water.[20]\n  * In 1518 another Castilian opinion was provided by Martin Fernandez de Enciso. Harrisse concluded that Enciso placed his line at 47°24'W on his sphere (7.7% smaller than ours), but at 45°38'W on our sphere using Enciso's numerical data. Enciso also described the coastal features near which the line passed in a very confused manner. Harrisse concluded from this description that Enciso's line could also be near the mouth of the Amazon between [49°](/wiki/49th_meridian_west \"49th meridian west\") and [50°W](/wiki/50th_meridian_west \"50th meridian west\").[21]\n  * In 1524 the Castilian pilots (ships' captains) Thomas Duran, Sebastian Cabot (son of [John Cabot](/wiki/John_Cabot \"John Cabot\")), and Juan Vespuccius (nephew of [Amerigo Vespucci](/wiki/Amerigo_Vespucci \"Amerigo Vespucci\")) gave their opinion to the Badajoz Junta, whose failure to resolve the dispute led to the Treaty of Saragossa. They specified that the line was 22° plus nearly 9 miles west of the center of [Santo Antão](/wiki/Santo_Ant%C3%A3o,_Cape_Verde \"Santo Antão, Cape Verde\") (the westernmost Cape Verde island), which Harrisse concluded was 47°17'W on their sphere (3.1% smaller than ours) and 46°36'W on our sphere.[22]\n  * In 1524 the Portuguese presented a globe to the Badajoz Junta on which the line was marked 21°30' west of Santo Antão (22°6'36\" on our sphere).[23]\n\n## Antimeridian: Moluccas and Treaty of\nZaragoza[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Treaty_of_Tordesillas&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Antimeridian: Moluccas and Treaty of Zaragoza\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Instead, Spain\nand Portugal could conquer any new lands they were the first to discover,\nSpain to the west and Portugal to the east, even if they passed each other on\nthe other side of the globe.[24] But Portugal's discovery of the highly valued\n[Moluccas](/wiki/Moluccas \"Moluccas\") in 1512 caused Spain to argue in 1518\nthat the Treaty of Tordesillas divided the Earth into two equal hemispheres.\nAfter the surviving ships of [Magellan](/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan \"Ferdinand\nMagellan\")'s fleet visited the Moluccas in 1521, Spain claimed that those\nislands were within its western hemisphere. In 1523, the [Treaty of\nVitoria](/w/index.php?title=Treaty_of_Vitoria&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Treaty of\nVitoria \\(page does not exist\\)\") called for the [Badajoz\nJunta](/w/index.php?title=Badajoz_Junta&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Badajoz Junta\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") to meet in 1524, at which the two countries tried to\nreach an agreement on the anti-meridian but failed.[25] They finally agreed in\na treaty signed at [Zaragoza](/wiki/Zaragoza \"Zaragoza\") that Spain would\nrelinquish its claims to the Moluccas upon the payment of 350,000\n[ducats](/wiki/Ducat \"Ducat\") (≈100 kg) of gold by Portugal to Spain. To\nprevent Spain from encroaching upon Portugal's Moluccas, the anti-meridian was\nto be 297.5 leagues or 17° to the east of the Moluccas, passing through the\nislands of Las Velas and Santo Thome.[26] This distance is slightly smaller\nthan the 300 leagues determined by Magellan as the westward distance from los\nLadrones to the Philippine island of [Samar](/wiki/Samar_\\(island\\) \"Samar\n\\(island\\)\"), which is just west of due north of the Moluccas.[27]\n\nThe Moluccas are a group of islands west of [New Guinea](/wiki/New_Guinea \"New\nGuinea\"). However, unlike the large modern [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesia\n\"Indonesia\") [archipelago](/wiki/Archipelago \"Archipelago\") of the [Maluku\nIslands](/wiki/Maluku_Islands \"Maluku Islands\"), to 16th-century Europeans the\nMoluccas were a small chain of islands, the only place on Earth where\n[cloves](/wiki/Clove \"Clove\") grew, just west of the large north Malukan\nisland of [Halmahera](/wiki/Halmahera \"Halmahera\") (called Gilolo at the\ntime). Cloves were so prized by Europeans for their medicinal uses that they\nwere worth their weight in gold.[28][29] 16th- and 17th-century maps and\ndescriptions indicate that the main islands were [Ternate](/wiki/Ternate\n\"Ternate\"), [Tidore](/wiki/Tidore \"Tidore\"), [Moti](/wiki/Moti_Island \"Moti\nIsland\"), [Makian](/wiki/Makian \"Makian\") and [Bacan](/wiki/Bacan \"Bacan\"),\nalthough the last was often ignored even though it was by far the largest\nisland.[30][31][32] The principal island was Ternate at the chain's northern\nend (0°47'N, only 11 kilometres (7 mi) in diameter) on whose southwest coast\nthe Portuguese built a stone fort ([Forte de São João Baptista de\nTernate](/wiki/Fort_Kastela \"Fort Kastela\")) during 1522–23,[33] which could\nonly be repaired, not modified, according to the Treaty of Saragossa. This\nnorth-south chain occupies two degrees of [latitude](/wiki/Latitude\n\"Latitude\") bisected by the equator at about 127°24'E, with Ternate, Tidore,\nMoti, and Makian north of the equator and Bacan south of it.\n\nAlthough the treaty's Santo Thome island has not been identified, its \"Islas\nde las Velas\" (Islands of the Sails) appear in a 1585 Spanish history of\nChina, on the 1594 world map of [Petrus Plancius](/wiki/Petrus_Plancius\n\"Petrus Plancius\"), on an anonymous map of the Moluccas in the 1598 London\nedition of [Linschoten](/wiki/Jan_Huyghen_van_Linschoten \"Jan Huyghen van\nLinschoten\"), and on the 1607 world map of Petro Kærio, identified as a north-\nsouth chain of islands in the northwest Pacific, which were also called the\n\"Islas de los Ladrones\" (Islands of the Thieves) during that\nperiod.[34][35][36] Their name was changed by Spain in 1667 to \"Islas de las\nMarianas\" ([Mariana Islands](/wiki/Mariana_Islands \"Mariana Islands\")), which\ninclude [Guam](/wiki/Guam \"Guam\") at their southern end. Guam's longitude of\n144°45'E is east of the Moluccas' longitude of 127°24'E by 17°21', which is\nremarkably close by 16th-century standards to the treaty's 17° east. This\nlongitude passes through the eastern end of the main north Japanese island of\n[Hokkaidō](/wiki/Hokkaid%C5%8D \"Hokkaidō\") and through the eastern end of New\nGuinea, which is where Frédéric Durand placed the demarcation line.[37]\nMoriarty and Keistman placed the demarcation line at 147°E by measuring 16.4°\neast from the western end of New Guinea (or 17° east of 130°E).[38] Despite\nthe treaty's clear statement that the demarcation line passes 17° east of the\nMoluccas, some sources place the line just east of the Moluccas.[39][40][41]\n\nThe Treaty of Saragossa did not modify or clarify the line of demarcation in\nthe Treaty of Tordesillas, nor did it validate Spain's claim to equal\nhemispheres (180° each), so the two lines divided the Earth into unequal\nhemispheres. Portugal's portion was roughly 191° whereas Spain's portion was\nroughly 169°. Both portions have a large uncertainty of ±4° because of the\nwide variation in the opinions regarding the location of the Tordesillas line.\n\nPortugal gained control of all lands and seas west of the Saragossa line,\nincluding all of Asia and its neighboring islands so far \"discovered,\" leaving\nSpain most of the [Pacific Ocean](/wiki/Pacific_Ocean \"Pacific Ocean\").\nAlthough the Philippines were not named in the treaty, Spain implicitly\nrelinquished any claim to them because they were well west of the line.\nNevertheless, by 1542, King [Charles V](/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor\n\"Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor\") decided to colonize the Philippines, judging\nthat Portugal would not protest because the archipelago had no spices.\nAlthough a number of expeditions sent from [New Spain](/wiki/New_Spain \"New\nSpain\") arrived in the Philippines, they were unable to establish a settlement\nbecause the return route across the Pacific was unknown.

However, it quickly\nbecame obsolete in North America, and later in Asia and Africa, where it\naffected colonization. It was ignored by other European nations, and with the\ndecline of Spanish and Portuguese power, the home countries were unable to\nhold many of their claims, much less expand them into poorly explored areas.\nThus, with sufficient backing, it became possible for any European state to\ncolonize open territories, or those weakly held by Lisbon or Madrid. With the\nfall of [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca \"Malacca\") to the Dutch, the VOC ([Dutch East\nIndia Company](/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company \"Dutch East India Company\"))\ntook control of Portuguese possessions in Indonesia, claiming Western New\nGuinea and Western Australia, as [New Holland](/wiki/New_Holland_\\(Australia\\)\n\"New Holland \\(Australia\\)\"). Eastern Australia remained in the Spanish half\nof the world until claimed for Britain by [James Cook](/wiki/James_Cook \"James\nCook\") in 1770.

Spain was\nacknowledged sovereignty over the Philippines, while Portugal would get the\nterritory of the Amazon River basin.
