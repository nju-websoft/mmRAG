Battle** or the **Siege of Little York**\n,[a][b] ending on October 19, 1781, at [Yorktown,\nVirginia](/wiki/Yorktown,_Virginia \"Yorktown, Virginia\"), was a decisive\nvictory by a combined force of American [Continental\nArmy](/wiki/Continental_Army \"Continental Army\") troops led by General [George\nWashington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\") and [French Army\ntroops](/wiki/France_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"France in the American\nRevolutionary War\") led by the [Comte de Rochambeau](/wiki/Jean-\nBaptiste_Donatien_de_Vimeur,_comte_de_Rochambeau \"Jean-Baptiste Donatien de\nVimeur, comte de Rochambeau\") over a [British Army](/wiki/British_Army\n\"British Army\") commanded by British peer and Lieutenant General [Charles\nCornwallis](/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis \"Charles\nCornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis\"). The culmination of the [Yorktown\ncampaign](/wiki/Yorktown_campaign \"Yorktown campaign\"), the siege proved to be\nthe last major land battle of the [American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American Revolutionary War\") in the\nNorth American theater, as the surrender by Cornwallis, and the capture of\nboth him and his army, prompted the British government to negotiate an end to\nthe conflict. The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French\nenthusiasm for the war, as well as undermining popular support for the\nconflict in Great Britain.[8]\n\nIn 1780, approximately 5,500 French soldiers landed in Rhode Island to assist\ntheir American allies in operations against British-controlled New York City.\nFollowing the arrival of dispatches from France that included the possibility\nof support from the French [West Indies](/wiki/West_Indies \"West Indies\")\nfleet of the [Comte de Grasse](/wiki/Comte_de_Grasse \"Comte de Grasse\"),\nWashington and Rochambeau decided to ask de Grasse for assistance either in\nbesieging New York, or in military operations against a British army operating\nin Virginia. On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his\nintent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay, where Cornwallis had taken command of\nthe army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer,\n[Henry Clinton](/wiki/Henry_Clinton_\\(American_War_of_Independence\\) \"Henry\nClinton \\(American War of Independence\\)\"), was eventually ordered to build a\ndefensible deep-water port, which he began to do in Yorktown, Virginia.\nCornwallis' movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force\nled by the [Marquis de Lafayette](/wiki/Marquis_de_Lafayette \"Marquis de\nLafayette\").\n\nThe French and American armies united north of New York City during the summer\nof 1781. When word of de Grasse's decision arrived, both armies began moving\nsouth toward Virginia, engaging in tactics of deception to lead the British to\nbelieve a siege of New York was planned. De Grasse sailed from the West Indies\nand arrived at the Chesapeake Bay at the end of August, bringing additional\ntroops and creating a naval blockade of Yorktown. He was transporting 500,000\nsilver pesos collected from the citizens of Havana, Cuba, to fund supplies for\nthe siege and payroll for the Continental Army.[9] While in Santo Domingo, de\nGrasse met with [Francisco Saavedra de\nSangronis](/wiki/Francisco_Saavedra_de_Sangronis \"Francisco Saavedra de\nSangronis\"), an agent of [Carlos III](/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain \"Charles III\nof Spain\") of Spain. De Grasse had planned to leave several of his warships in\nSanto Domingo. Saavedra promised the assistance of the Spanish navy to protect\nthe French merchant fleet, enabling de Grasse to sail north with all of his\nwarships.[10] In the beginning of September, he defeated a British fleet led\nby [Sir Thomas Graves](/wiki/Thomas_Graves,_1st_Baron_Graves \"Thomas Graves,\n1st Baron Graves\") that came to relieve Cornwallis at the [Battle of the\nChesapeake](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Chesapeake \"Battle of the Chesapeake\"). As a\nresult of this victory, de Grasse blocked any escape by sea for Cornwallis. By\nlate September Washington and Rochambeau arrived, and the army and naval\nforces completely surrounded Cornwallis.\n\nAfter initial preparations, the Americans and French built their first\nparallel and began the bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on\nOctober 14, 1781 Washington sent two columns to attack the last major\nremaining British outer defenses. A French column under [Wilhelm of the\nPalatinate-Zweibrücken](/wiki/Wilhelm_of_the_Palatinate-Zweibr%C3%BCcken\n\"Wilhelm of the Palatinate-Zweibrücken\") took [Redoubt](/wiki/Redoubt\n\"Redoubt\") No. 9 and an American column under [Alexander\nHamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\") took Redoubt No. 10.\nWith these defenses taken, the allies were able to finish their [second\nparallel](/wiki/Siege#Age_of_gunpowder \"Siege\"). With the American artillery\ncloser and its bombardment more intense than ever, the British position began\nto deteriorate rapidly and Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October\n17. After two days of negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October\n19; Lord Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony. With the capture of more\nthan 7,000 British soldiers, negotiations between the United States and [Great\nBritain](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great Britain\") began,\nresulting in the [Treaty of Paris](/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\\(1783\\) \"Treaty of\nParis \\(1783\\)\") of 1783.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Prelude\n    * 1.1 Franco-American cooperation\n    * 1.2 March to Virginia\n  * 2 The siege\n    * 2.1 Initial movements\n    * 2.2 Bombardment\n    * 2.3 Assault on the redoubts\n    * 2.4 British surrender\n    * 2.5 Casualties\n    * 2.6 Article 10 controversy\n    * 2.7 Effect of disease\n  * 3 Aftermath\n  * 4 Legacy\n  * 5 Yorktown Victory Monument\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 Notes\n  * 8 References\n    * 8.1 Citations\n    * 8.2 Bibliography\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Prelude[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Prelude\")]\n\nMain article: [Yorktown campaign](/wiki/Yorktown_campaign \"Yorktown campaign\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Plan_of_the_Battle_of_Yorktown_1875.png/367px-\nPlan_of_the_Battle_of_Yorktown_1875.png)](/wiki/File:Plan_of_the_Battle_of_Yorktown_1875.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Plan_of_the_Battle_of_Yorktown_1875.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA plan of the Battle of Yorktown drawn in 1875\n\n### Franco-American\ncooperation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Franco-American cooperation\")]\n\nMain articles: [Franco-American alliance](/wiki/Franco-American_alliance\n\"Franco-American alliance\") and [Southern theater of the American\nRevolutionary War](/wiki/Southern_theater_of_the_American_Revolutionary_War\n\"Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War\")\n\nOn December 20, 1780, [Benedict Arnold](/wiki/Benedict_Arnold \"Benedict\nArnold\") sailed from New York with 1,500 troops to [Portsmouth,\nVirginia](/wiki/Portsmouth,_Virginia \"Portsmouth, Virginia\").

After they proved\nineffective, he took a larger force of 8 ships in March 1781, and [fought a\ntactically inconclusive battle with the British\nfleet](/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Henry \"Battle of Cape Henry\") of [Marriot\nArbuthnot](/wiki/Marriot_Arbuthnot \"Marriot Arbuthnot\") at the mouth of the\n[Chesapeake Bay](/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay \"Chesapeake Bay\"). Destouches withdrew\ndue to the damage sustained to his fleet, leaving Arbuthnot and the British\nfleet in control of the bay's mouth.[12]\n\nOn March 26, Arnold was joined by 2,300 troops under command of Major General\n[William Phillips](/wiki/William_Phillips_\\(British_Army_officer\\) \"William\nPhillips \\(British Army officer\\)\"), who took command of the combined\nforces.[12] Phillips resumed raiding, [defeating the militia at\nBlandford](/wiki/Battle_of_Blandford \"Battle of Blandford\"), then burning the\ntobacco warehouses at [Petersburg](/wiki/Petersburg,_Virginia \"Petersburg,\nVirginia\") on April 25.

He immediately assumed command, as Phillips had recently died of\na fever.[12][13] Cornwallis had not received permission to abandon the\nCarolinas from his superior, [Henry\nClinton](/wiki/Henry_Clinton_\\(American_War_of_Independence\\) \"Henry Clinton\n\\(American War of Independence\\)\"), but he believed that Virginia would be\neasier to capture, feeling that it would approve of an invading British\narmy.[12]\n\nWith the arrival of Cornwallis and more reinforcements from New York, the\nBritish Army numbered 7,200 men.[3] Cornwallis wanted to push Lafayette, whose\nforce now numbered 3,000 men with the arrival of Virginia militia.[3] On May\n24, he set out after Lafayette, who withdrew from Richmond, and linked forces\nwith those under the command of [Baron von Steuben](/wiki/Baron_von_Steuben\n\"Baron von Steuben\") and [Anthony Wayne](/wiki/Anthony_Wayne \"Anthony\nWayne\").[3] Cornwallis did not pursue Lafayette. Instead, he sent raiders into\ncentral Virginia, where they attacked depots and supply convoys, before being\nrecalled on June 20. Cornwallis then headed for Williamsburg, and Lafayette's\nforce of now 4,500 followed him.[14] General Clinton, in a confusing series of\norders, ordered Cornwallis first to Portsmouth and then Yorktown, where he was\ninstructed to build fortifications for a deep water port.[15][16]\n\nOn July 6, the French and American armies met at [White\nPlains](/wiki/White_Plains,_New_York \"White Plains, New York\"), north of New\nYork City.[17] Although Rochambeau had almost 40 years of warfare experience,\nhe never challenged Washington's authority, telling Washington he had come to\nserve, not to command.[18]\n\nWashington and Rochambeau discussed where to launch a joint attack.[19]\nWashington believed an attack on New York was the best option, since the\nAmericans and French now outnumbered the British defenders 3 to 1. Rochambeau\ndisagreed, arguing the fleet in the [West Indies](/wiki/West_Indies \"West\nIndies\") under [Admiral de Grasse](/wiki/Admiral_de_Grasse \"Admiral de\nGrasse\") was going to sail to the American coast, where easier options than\nattacking New York could be attempted.[19]\n\nIn early July, Washington suggested an attack be made at the northern part of\n[Manhattan Island](/wiki/Manhattan_Island \"Manhattan Island\"), but his\nofficers and Rochambeau all disagreed.[20] Washington continued to probe the\nNew York area until August 14, when he received a letter from de Grasse\nstating he was headed for Virginia with 29 warships and 3,200 soldiers, but\ncould only remain there until October 14.[20] De Grasse encouraged Washington\nto move south so they could launch a joint operation. Washington abandoned his\nplan to take New York, and began to prepare his army for the march south to\nVirginia.[21]\n\n### March to\nVirginia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: March to Virginia\")]\n\nOn August 19, the march to Yorktown led by Washington and Rochambeau began,\nwhich is known now as the \"[celebrated march](/wiki/Washington-\nRochambeau_Revolutionary_Route \"Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary\nRoute\").\"[21] 4,000 French and 3,000 American soldiers began the march in\n[Newport, Rhode Island](/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island \"Newport, Rhode Island\"),\nwhile the rest remained behind to protect the [Hudson\nValley](/wiki/Hudson_Valley \"Hudson Valley\"). Washington wanted to maintain\ncomplete secrecy of their destination.[22] To ensure this, he sent out fake\ndispatches that reached Clinton revealing that the Franco-American army was\ngoing to launch an attack on New York, and that Cornwallis was not in\ndanger.[23]\n\nThe French and American armies marched through Philadelphia from September 2\nto the 4th, where the American soldiers announced they would not leave\nMaryland until they received one month's pay in coin, rather than in the\nworthless Continental paper currency. General Rochambeau generously loaned\nWashington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would be the last\ntime the men would be paid. It significantly strengthened French and American\nrelations[24] On September 5, Washington learned of the arrival of de Grasse's\nfleet off the [Virginia Capes](/wiki/Virginia_Capes \"Virginia Capes\"). De\nGrasse debarked his French troops to join Lafayette, and then sent his empty\ntransports to pick up the American troops.[21] Washington made a visit to his\nhome, [Mount Vernon](/wiki/Mount_Vernon \"Mount Vernon\"), on his way to\nYorktown.[25]\n\nIn August, Admiral [Sir Thomas Graves](/wiki/Thomas_Graves,_1st_Baron_Graves\n\"Thomas Graves, 1st Baron Graves\") led a fleet from New York to attack de\nGrasse's fleet. Graves did not realize how large the French fleet was, and\nneither did Cornwallis.[25] The British fleet was defeated by de Grasse's\nfleet in the [Battle of the Chesapeake](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Chesapeake \"Battle\nof the Chesapeake\") on September 5, and forced to fall back to New York.[25]\nOn September 14, Washington arrived in [Williamsburg,\nVirginia](/wiki/Williamsburg,_Virginia \"Williamsburg, Virginia\").[25]\n\n## The siege[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: The siege\")]\n\nSee also: [Yorktown order of battle](/wiki/Yorktown_order_of_battle \"Yorktown\norder of battle\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Bataille_de_Yorktown_by_Auguste_Couder.jpg/275px-\nBataille_de_Yorktown_by_Auguste_Couder.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bataille_de_Yorktown_by_Auguste_Couder.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bataille_de_Yorktown_by_Auguste_Couder.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Siège de Yorktown_ by [Auguste Couder](/wiki/Auguste_Couder \"Auguste\nCouder\"), c. 1836.[c] Rochambeau and Washington giving their last orders\nbefore the battle.\n\n### Initial\nmovements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Initial movements\")]\n\nOn September 26, transports with artillery, siege tools, and some French\ninfantry and shock troops from [Head of Elk](/wiki/Elkton,_Maryland \"Elkton,\nMaryland\"), the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay, arrived, giving Washington\ncommand of an army of 7,800 Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000\nContinentals.[2] Early on September 28, Washington led the army out of\nWilliamsburg to surround Yorktown.[26] The French took the positions on the\nleft while the Americans took the position of honor on the right.[2]\nCornwallis had a chain of seven [redoubts](/wiki/Redoubt \"Redoubt\") and\nbatteries linked by earthworks along with batteries that covered the narrows\nof the [York River](/wiki/York_River_\\(Virginia\\) \"York River \\(Virginia\\)\")\nat [Gloucester Point](/wiki/Gloucester_Point \"Gloucester Point\").[2] That day,\nWashington reconnoitered the British defenses and decided that they could be\nbombarded into submission.[27] The Americans and the French spent the night of\nthe 28th sleeping out in the open, while work parties built bridges over the\nmarsh. Some of the American soldiers hunted down wild hogs to eat.[28]\n\nOn September 29, Washington moved the army closer to Yorktown and British\ngunners opened fire on the infantry.[29] Throughout the day several British\ncannon fired on the Americans but there were few casualties. Fire was also\nexchanged between American riflemen and [Hessian](/wiki/Hessian_\\(soldier\\)\n\"Hessian \\(soldier\\)\") [Jägers](/wiki/J%C3%A4ger_\\(military\\) \"Jäger\n\\(military\\)\").[29]\n\nCornwallis pulled back from all of his outer defenses, except for the\n[Fusilier](/wiki/Fusilier \"Fusilier\")'s redoubt on the west side of the town\nand redoubts 9 and 10 in the east.[2] Cornwallis had his forces occupy the\nearthworks immediately surrounding the town because he had received a letter\nfrom Clinton that promised relief force of 5,000 men within a week and he\nwished to tighten his lines.[2][30] The Americans and the French occupied the\nabandoned defenses and began to establish their own batteries there.[31] With\nthe British outer defenses in their hands, allied engineers began to lay out\npositions for the artillery. The men improved their works and deepened their\ntrenches.[32] The British also worked on improving their defenses.[32]\n\nOn September 30, the French attacked the British Fusiliers redoubt.[33] The\nskirmish lasted two hours, in which the French were repulsed suffering several\ncasualties. On October 1, the allies learned from British deserters that, to\npreserve their food, the British had slaughtered hundreds of horses and thrown\nthem on the beach.[33] In the American camp, thousands of trees were cut down\nto provide wood for earthworks. Preparations for the\n[parallel](/wiki/Siege#Age_of_gunpowder \"Siege\") also began.[34]\n\nAs the allies began to put their artillery into place, the British kept up a\nsteady fire to disrupt them.[35] British fire increased on the 2nd and the\nallies suffered moderate casualties. General Washington continued to make\nvisits to the front, despite concern shown by several of his officers over the\nincreasing enemy fire.[36] On the night of October 2, the British opened a\nstorm of fire to cover up the movement of the British cavalry to Gloucester\nwhere they were to escort infantrymen on a foraging party.[36] On the 3rd, the\nforaging party, led by [Banastre Tarleton](/wiki/Banastre_Tarleton \"Banastre\nTarleton\"), went out but collided with [Lauzun's\nLegion](/wiki/Lauzun%27s_Legion \"Lauzun's Legion\"), and [John\nMercer](/wiki/John_Francis_Mercer \"John Francis Mercer\")'s Virginia militia,\nled by the [Marquis de Choisy](/wiki/Marquis_de_Choisy \"Marquis de Choisy\").\nThe British cavalry quickly retreated back behind their defensive lines,\nlosing 50 men.[37]\n\nBy October 5, Washington was almost ready to open the first parallel.[38] That\nnight the [sappers](/wiki/Sappers \"Sappers\") and miners worked, putting strips\nof pine on the wet sand to mark the path of the trenches.[38]\n\n###\nBombardment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Bombardment\")]\n\nAfter nightfall on October 6, troops moved out in stormy weather to dig the\nfirst parallel: the heavily overcast sky negated the waning full moon and\nshielded the massive digging operation from the eyes of British sentries.[d]\nWashington ceremoniously struck several blows with his pick axe to begin the\ntrench. The trench was to be 2,000 yards (1,800 m) long, running from the head\nof Yorktown to the York River.[40] Half of the trench was to be commanded by\nthe French, the other half by the Americans. On the northernmost end of the\nFrench line, a support trench was dug so that they could bombard the British\nships in the river.[40] The French were ordered to distract the British with a\nfalse attack, but the British were told of the plan by a French deserter and\nthe British artillery fire turned on the French from the Fusiliers\nredoubt.[41]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Washingtonyorktown.jpg/250px-\nWashingtonyorktown.jpg)](/wiki/File:Washingtonyorktown.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Washingtonyorktown.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWashington firing the first gun\n\nOn October 7, the British saw the new allied trench just out of musket-\nrange.[41] Over the next two days the allies completed the gun placements and\ndragged the artillery into line. The British fire began to weaken when they\nsaw the large number of guns the allies had.[42]\n\nBy October 9, all of the French and American guns were in place.[42] Among the\nAmerican guns there were three twenty-four pounders, three eighteen pounders,\ntwo eight-inch (203 mm) howitzers and six mortars, totaling fourteen guns. At\n3:00 pm, the French guns opened the barrage and drove the British frigate,\n[HMS _Guadeloupe_](/wiki/HMS_Guadeloupe_\\(1763\\) \"HMS Guadeloupe \\(1763\\)\")\nacross the York River, where she was scuttled to prevent capture. At 5:00 pm\nthe Americans opened fire.[42] Washington fired the first gun; legend has it\nthat this shot smashed into a table where British officers were eating. The\nFranco-American guns began to tear apart the British defenses.[43] Washington\nordered that the guns fire all night so that the British could not make\nrepairs.[43] All of the British guns on the left were soon silenced. The\nBritish soldiers began to pitch their tents in their trenches and soldiers\nbegan to desert in large numbers.[44] Some British ships were also damaged by\ncannonballs that flew across the town into the harbor.[44]\n\nOn October 10, the Americans spotted a large house in Yorktown.[45] Believing\nthat Cornwallis might be stationed there, they aimed at it and quickly\ndestroyed it. Cornwallis sank more than a dozen of his ships in the harbor.\nThe French began to fire at the British ships and scored a hit on the British\n[HMS _Charon_](/w/index.php?title=HMS_Charon_\\(1778\\)&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"HMS Charon \\(1778\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\"), which caught fire, and in turn\nset two or three other ships on fire.[46] Cornwallis received word from\nClinton that the British fleet was to depart on October 12, however Cornwallis\nresponded by saying that he would not be able to hold out for long.[47]\n\nOn the night of October 11, Washington ordered that the Americans dig a second\nparallel.[47] It was 400 yards (370 m) closer to the British lines, but could\nnot be extended to the river because the British number 9 and 10 redoubts were\nin the way. During the night, the British fire continued to land in the old\nline; Cornwallis did not suspect that a new parallel was being dug.[47] By\nmorning of the 12th, the allied troops were in position on the new line.[47]\n\n### Assault on the\nredoubts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Assault on the redoubts\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Bataille_Yorktown.jpg/250px-\nBataille_Yorktown.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bataille_Yorktown.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bataille_Yorktown.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nStorming of Redoubt #10\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Redbout-10.jpg/250px-\nRedbout-10.jpg)](/wiki/File:Redbout-10.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Redbout-10.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe storming of Redoubt No. 10, by [Eugene Lami](/wiki/Eugene_Lami \"Eugene\nLami\")\n\nBy October 14, the trenches were within 150 yards (140 m) of redoubts No. 9\nand No. 10.[48] Washington ordered that all guns within range begin blasting\nthe redoubts to weaken them for an assault that evening.[49] Washington\nplanned to use the cover of a moonless night to gain the element of\nsurprise.[e] To reinforce the darkness, he added silence, ordering that no\nsoldier should load his musket until reaching the fortifications- the advance\nwould be made with only \"cold steel.\" Redoubt 10 was near the river and held\nonly 70 men, while redoubt 9 was a quarter of a mile inland, and was held by\n120 British and Germans.[49] Both redoubts were heavily fortified with rows of\n[abatis](/wiki/Abatis \"Abatis\") surrounding them, along with muddy ditches\nthat surrounded the redoubts at about 25 yards (23 m).[48] Washington devised\na plan in which the French would launch a diversionary attack on the Fusiliers\nredoubt, and then a half an hour later, the French would assault redoubt 9 and\nthe Americans redoubt 10.[49][51] Redoubt 9 would be assaulted by 400 French\nregular soldiers under the command of the German Lieutenant Colonel [Wilhelm\nvon Zweibrücken](/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Zweibr%C3%BCcken \"Wilhelm von Zweibrücken\")\nand redoubt 10 would be assaulted by 400 [light\ninfantry](/wiki/List_of_Continental_Army_units#Light_infantry \"List of\nContinental Army units\") troops under the command of [Alexander\nHamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\").[51] There was\nbriefly a dispute as to who should lead the attack on Redoubt No. 10.\nLafayette named his aide, [Jean-Joseph Sourbader de Gimat](/wiki/Jean-\nJoseph_Sourbader_de_Gimat \"Jean-Joseph Sourbader de Gimat\"), who commanded a\nbattalion of Continental light infantry.

Hamilton sent\n[Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens](/wiki/John_Laurens \"John Laurens\") around to\nthe rear of the redoubt to prevent the British from escaping.[54] The\nAmericans reached the redoubt and began chopping through the British wooden\ndefenses with their axes. A British sentry called a challenge, and then fired\nat the Americans.[54] The Americans responded by charging with their bayonets\ntowards the redoubt. They hacked through the abatis, crossed a ditch and\nclimbed the [parapet](/wiki/Parapet \"Parapet\") into the redoubt.[55] The\nAmericans forced their way into the redoubt falling into giant shell holes\nfrom the bombardment of the redoubts. The British fire was heavy, but the\nAmericans overwhelmed them.[55] Someone in the front shouted, \"Rush on boys!\nThe fort's ours!\" The British threw hand grenades at the Americans with little\neffect.[55] Men in the trench stood on the shoulders of their comrades to\nclimb into the redoubt. The bayonet fight cleared the British out of the\nredoubt and almost the entire garrison was captured, including the commander\nof the redoubt, Major Campbell.[56] In the assault, the Americans lost 9 dead\nand 25 wounded.[56]\n\nThe French assault began at the same time, but they were halted by the abatis,\nwhich was undamaged by the artillery fire.[56] The French began to hack at the\nabatis and a Hessian sentry came out and asked who was there. When there was\nno response, the sentry opened fire as did other Hessians on the parapet.[57]\nThe French soldiers fired back, and then charged the redoubt. The Germans\ncharged the Frenchmen climbing over the walls but the French fired a volley,\ndriving them back.[57] The Hessians then took a defensive position behind some\nbarrels but threw down their arms and surrendered when the French prepared a\nbayonet charge.[57]\n\nWith the capture of redoubts 9 and 10, Washington was able to have his\nartillery shell the town from three directions and the allies moved some of\ntheir artillery into the redoubts.[58][59] On October 15, Cornwallis turned\nall of his guns onto the nearest allied position. He then ordered a storming\nparty of 350 British troops under the command of Colonel [Robert\nAbercromby](/wiki/Robert_Abercromby_of_Airthrey \"Robert Abercromby of\nAirthrey\") to attack the allied lines and spike the American and French cannon\n(i.e., plug the [touch hole](/wiki/Touch_hole \"Touch hole\") with an iron\nspike).[60] The allies were sleeping and unprepared. As the British charged\nAbercromby shouted \"Push on my brave boys, and skin the bastards!\"[59] The\nBritish party spiked several cannon in the parallel and then spiked the guns\non an unfinished redoubt.[61] A French party came and drove them out of the\nallied lines and back to Yorktown.

Greene mentions a\nGerman account that gives much higher figures: 309 killed and 595 wounded.[4]\n\n### Article 10\ncontroversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Article 10 controversy\")]\n\nGeorge Washington refused to accept the Tenth Article of the Yorktown Articles\nof Capitulation, which granted immunity to [American\nLoyalists](/wiki/Loyalist_\\(American_Revolution\\) \"Loyalist \\(American\nRevolution\\)\"), and Cornwallis failed to make any effort to press the matter.\n\"The outcry against the Tenth Article was vociferous and immediate, as\nAmericans on both sides of the Atlantic proclaimed their sense of\nbetrayal.\"[78]\n\n### Effect of\ndisease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Effect of disease\")]\n\n[Malaria](/wiki/Malaria \"Malaria\") was endemic in the marshlands of eastern\nVirginia during the time, and Cornwallis's army suffered greatly from the\ndisease; he estimated during the surrender that half of his army was unable to\nfight as a result. The Continental Army enjoyed an advantage, in that most of\ntheir members had grown up with malaria, and hence had acquired resistance to\nthe disease. As malaria has a month-long incubation period, most of the French\nsoldiers had not begun to exhibit symptoms before the surrender.[79][80]\n\n##\nAftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Libertas_Americana_silver_medallion_1783.jpg/220px-\nLibertas_Americana_silver_medallion_1783.jpg)](/wiki/File:Libertas_Americana_silver_medallion_1783.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Libertas_Americana_silver_medallion_1783.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe victory at Yorktown was honored in a 1783 medallion minted in Paris and\ndesigned there by US Ambassador [Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin\n\"Benjamin Franklin\").\n\nFive days after the battle ended, on October 24, 1781, the British fleet sent\nby Clinton to rescue the British army arrived. The fleet picked up several\nLoyalists who had escaped on October 18, and they informed Admiral Thomas\nGraves that they believed Cornwallis had surrendered.[81] Graves picked up\nseveral more Loyalists along the coast, and they confirmed this fact. Graves\nsighted the French Fleet, but chose to leave because he was outnumbered by\nnine ships, and thus he sent the fleet back to New York.[82]\n\nAfter the British surrender, Washington sent [Tench\nTilghman](/wiki/Tench_Tilghman \"Tench Tilghman\") to report the victory to\nCongress.[83] After a difficult journey, he arrived in Philadelphia, which\ncelebrated for several days. The British Prime Minister, [Lord\nNorth](/wiki/Frederick_North,_Lord_North \"Frederick North, Lord North\"), is\nreported to have exclaimed \"Oh God, it's all over\" when told of the\ndefeat.[84] Washington moved his army to [New Windsor, New\nYork](/wiki/New_Windsor,_New_York \"New Windsor, New York\")[85] where they\nremained stationed until the [Treaty of Paris](/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\\(1783\\)\n\"Treaty of Paris \\(1783\\)\") was signed on September 3, 1783, formally ending\nthe war.[86]\n\n## Legacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Yorktown&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Legacy\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Yorktown_1931_Issue-2c.jpg/220px-\nYorktown_1931_Issue-2c.jpg)](/wiki/File:Yorktown_1931_Issue-2c.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Yorktown_1931_Issue-2c.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nUS Postage Stamp, 1931 issue, depicting [Rochambeau](/wiki/Jean-\nBaptiste_Donatien_de_Vimeur,_comte_de_Rochambeau \"Jean-Baptiste Donatien de\nVimeur, comte de Rochambeau\"), [George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington\n\"George Washington\") and [De Grasse](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Joseph_Paul_de_Grasse\n\"François Joseph Paul de Grasse\"), commemorating 150th anniversary of the\nvictory at Yorktown, 1781\n\nOn October 19, 1881, an elaborate ceremony took place to honor the battle's\ncentennial. U.S. naval vessels floated on Chesapeake Bay, and special markers\nhighlighted where Washington and Lafayette's [siege guns](/wiki/Siege_engine\n\"Siege engine\") were placed. President [Chester Arthur](/wiki/Chester_Arthur\n\"Chester Arthur\"), sworn in only thirty days before, following [James\nGarfield](/wiki/James_A._Garfield \"James A.

To close the ceremony, Arthur gave an order to salute the [British\nflag](/wiki/Union_Flag \"Union Flag\").[87]\n\nThere is a belief that General Cornwallis's sword, surrendered by Charles\nO'Hara after the battle, is to this day on display at the [White\nHouse](/wiki/White_House \"White House\"). However, U.S. National Park Service\nhistorian Jerome Green, in his 2005 history of the siege, _The Guns of\nIndependence_ , concurs with the 1881 centennial account by Johnston, noting\nsimply that when Brigadier General O'Hara presented the sword to Major General\nLincoln, he held it for a moment and immediately returned it to O'Hara.[88]\n\nThe siege of Yorktown is also known in some German\n[historiographies](/wiki/Historiography \"Historiography\") as \"die deutsche\nSchlacht\" (\"the German battle\"), because Germans played significant roles in\nall three armies, accounting for roughly one third of all forces involved.\nAccording to one estimate more than 2,500 German soldiers served at Yorktown\nwith each of the British and French armies, and more than 3,000 German-\nAmericans were in Washington's army.[89]\n\nFour Army National Guard units ([113th\nInf](/wiki/113th_Infantry_Regiment_\\(United_States\\) \"113th Infantry Regiment\n\\(United States\\)\"),[90] 116th Inf,[91] [175th\nInf](/wiki/175th_Infantry_Regiment_\\(United_States\\) \"175th Infantry Regiment\n\\(United States\\)\")[92] and 198th Sig Bn[93]) and one active Regular Army\nField Artillery battalion (1–5th FA[94]) are derived from American units that\nparticipated in the Battle of Yorktown.
