Derek explains that Mark\nhad an affair with his wife, [Addison](/wiki/Addison_Forbes_Montgomery\n\"Addison Forbes Montgomery\") ([Kate Walsh](/wiki/Kate_Walsh_\\(actress\\) \"Kate\nWalsh \\(actress\\)\")) while they were living in [New\nYork](/wiki/New_York_City,_New_York \"New York City, New York\"). Mark travels\nto [Seattle](/wiki/Seattle \"Seattle\"), intent on convincing Addison to return\nwith him, but his offer is rejected and Derek declines to renew their\nfriendship. Mark returns during [season\nthree](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy_\\(season_3\\) \"Grey's Anatomy \\(season 3\\)\") at\nAddison's drunken behest, but she again rejects him once sober. Undeterred,\nMark sells his successful private practice (which he previously shared with\nDerek) and takes over the plastics program at Seattle Grace Hospital. During\nMeredith's morphine rampage, Mark finds out about his nickname McSteamy which\nwas given to him by her during his first trip to Seattle back when he\nattempted to get Addison back and earn Derek's friendship back. It is later\nrevealed that Mark has at some point slept with all of Derek's sisters. Mark\nhas a brief fling with Addison's friend, [orthopedic\nsurgeon](/wiki/Orthopedic_surgeon \"Orthopedic surgeon\") [Callie\nTorres](/wiki/Callie_Torres \"Callie Torres\") ([Sara\nRamirez](/wiki/Sara_Ramirez \"Sara Ramirez\")), and develops a friendship with\nDerek's girlfriend, [intern](/wiki/Internship_\\(medicine\\) \"Internship\n\\(medicine\\)\") [Meredith Grey](/wiki/Meredith_Grey \"Meredith Grey\") ([Ellen\nPompeo](/wiki/Ellen_Pompeo \"Ellen Pompeo\")). It is revealed that after Derek\nleft New York, Mark and Addison continued their relationship for two months,\nduring which she conceived and aborted his child. Just weeks after moving to\nSeattle he quickly observes that Derek's true love was Meredith and tries to\nconvince Addison that her marriage with Derek was over. Mark enters into a\nsixty-day abstinence pact with Addison, agreeing that if they can remain\ncelibate for that time, Addison will give their relationship another chance.\nAddison ultimately breaks the pact by having sex with intern [Alex\nKarev](/wiki/Alex_Karev \"Alex Karev\") ([Justin Chambers](/wiki/Justin_Chambers\n\"Justin Chambers\")), and soon thereafter departs from Seattle to work in [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\").\n\nMark supports Derek when Meredith comes close to dying after drowning, and the\ntwo are able to rekindle their friendship. It is eventually revealed that he\nand Derek grew up together and that he, having lost his mother as a child and\nemotionally neglected by his father, considered Derek's mother as his maternal\nfigure. As he was an only child and Derek was the only son, they became close\nfriends and he was Derek's best man at the latter's wedding to Addison. He\nalso forms a friendship with Callie, and develops an attraction to\n[cardiothoracic surgeon](/wiki/Cardiothoracic_surgeon \"Cardiothoracic\nsurgeon\") [Erica Hahn](/wiki/Erica_Hahn \"Erica Hahn\") ([Brooke\nSmith](/wiki/Brooke_Smith_\\(actress\\) \"Brooke Smith \\(actress\\)\")). Erica does\nnot reciprocate his feelings, and he is supportive of Callie when she and\nErica have a brief relationship. When Addison shows up at Seattle Grace for a\ncase, Mark attempts to sleep with Addison again but she refuses. The nurses\nlater start a club against him called Nurses United Against Mark Sloan. After\na string of unresolved sexual tension on his part, Mark then finds himself\nseduced by [Lexie Grey](/wiki/Lexie_Grey \"Lexie Grey\") ([Chyler\nLeigh](/wiki/Chyler_Leigh \"Chyler Leigh\")), despite Derek's request that he\nkeep their relationship platonic even before their relationship had begun.\nThey begin a sexual relationship, which Lexie halts until he is willing to\npublicly admit to being her partner. Mark eventually agrees and tells Derek,\nwho attacks him. Animosity exists between them for several episodes, before\nthey once more repair their friendship. Mark and Lexie's relationship becomes\nincreasingly serious. He meets her father, [Thatcher](/wiki/Thatcher_Grey\n\"Thatcher Grey\") ([Jeff Perry](/wiki/Jeff_Perry_\\(American_actor\\) \"Jeff Perry\n\\(American actor\\)\")); and at the end of [season\nfive](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy_\\(season_5\\) \"Grey's Anatomy \\(season 5\\)\"), asks\nher to move in with him. Though Lexie initially declines, he remains committed\nto their relationship, and she agrees early in [season\nsix](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy_\\(season_6\\) \"Grey's Anatomy \\(season 6\\)\").\n\nMark discovers that he has an 18-year-old daughter, Sloan Riley ([Leven\nRambin](/wiki/Leven_Rambin \"Leven Rambin\")), who arrives seeking his support\nafter becoming pregnant and being evicted by her mother. Mark permits her to\nmove in with him, which angers Lexie. When Lexie makes it clear that she knew\nthat Mark would choose his own daughter over her, she puts an end to their\nrelationship. Sloan experiences difficulties in her pregnancy, so Mark takes\nher to LA to be treated. He and Addison once again sleep together, but when he\ncomes back he tells Lexie because he doesn't want to lie to her and wants them\nto get back together, but when she tells him she slept with Alex it puts an\nend to their relationship. When Sloan decides to give her baby up for\nadoption, Mark and Callie offer to raise it together. Sloan declines his offer\nand leaves Seattle, leaving Mark distraught. He enters into a relationship\nwith cardiothoracic surgeon [Teddy Altman](/wiki/Teddy_Altman \"Teddy Altman\")\n([Kim Raver](/wiki/Kim_Raver \"Kim Raver\")), despite the fact she is in love\nwith their [trauma](/wiki/Trauma_surgery \"Trauma surgery\") colleague, [Owen\nHunt](/wiki/Owen_Hunt \"Owen Hunt\") ([Kevin McKidd](/wiki/Kevin_McKidd \"Kevin\nMcKidd\")). Sloan returns unexpectedly and gives birth to a son. She\nreconsiders having the baby adopted, but when Mark reassures her that he will\nsupport her no matter what, gives the baby to an adoptive couple from\nWashington.\n\nIn the sixth-season finale, a gunman commits mass murder at the hospital. Mark\nhelps Lexie save Alex, her new boyfriend. In the aftermath of the shooting,\nLexie has a nervous breakdown and Mark has her committed to the psychiatric\nunit. Their friendship is strained, however Lexie softens towards him when she\nlearns that he is still in love with her. As Lexie goes to talk to Mark about\nhim still being in love with her, she sees Mark entering his apartment with\nDerek's sister Amelia kissing her and ultimately having sex with her. When\nCallie's girlfriend, [pediatric surgeon](/wiki/Pediatric_surgeon \"Pediatric\nsurgeon\") [Arizona Robbins](/wiki/Arizona_Robbins \"Arizona Robbins\") ([Jessica\nCapshaw](/wiki/Jessica_Capshaw \"Jessica Capshaw\")), breaks up with her, she\nand Mark have a drunken one-night stand. Shortly thereafter, he reconciles\nwith Lexie, but is delighted when Callie discovers she is pregnant with his\nchild. Lexie, however, is dismayed by the news and leaves Mark.\n\nMark asks Dr. [Jackson Avery](/wiki/Jackson_Avery \"Jackson Avery\") to find out\nhow Lexie's doing, but Jackson lies to Mark that he wasn't able to find it\nout, and he (Jackson) starts dating Lexie shortly after that. In the\nmeanwhile, Callie and Mark's daughter is born. Mark later gives Jackson and\nLexie his blessing, and tells Lexie he will let her go; Lexie replies that she\nis still in love with him, but right now she needs Jackson to be happy. After\ngiving Jackson a hard time, Mark finally acknowledges his surgery skills and\ndecides to teach him, although he still evidences feelings towards Lexie,\nwhile he shows his own parenting skills with Sofia. He also starts getting\nalong better with Arizona. After a long time without dating, Mark finally\nembarks on a relationship with Julia. This makes Lexie jealous, which leads to\nher and Jackson breaking up. Lexie struggles to tell Mark how she feels but\nfinally admits it leaving him torn between her and Julia. In the [season 8\nfinale](/wiki/Flight_\\(Grey%27s_Anatomy\\) \"Flight \\(Grey's Anatomy\\)\"), Mark,\nLexie, Derek, Meredith, Cristina, and Arizona are involved in an [aviation\naccident](/wiki/Aviation_accident \"Aviation accident\") while on the way to\n[Boise, Idaho](/wiki/Boise,_Idaho \"Boise, Idaho\") to perform surgery on\nconjoined twins, crushing Lexie under debris. After trying and failing to save\nher, Mark holds a dying Lexie by the hand, telling her that he has and will\nalways love her. He and the remaining surviving crash victims are left\nstranded in the woods, mourning Lexie and fighting to stay alive.\n\nIn the ninth-season premiere, it is discovered that Mark is on life support\ndue to the extensive injuries he sustained in the plane crash and, as\ndetermined by his will, the machines would be turned off if he showed no signs\nof waking within 30 days. Flashbacks of some moments in Mark's life showcased\nhim being videotaped as he was extending his congratulations to newlyweds\nCallie and Arizona. At the end of the speech, he declares that Lexie was the\none he wanted to grow old and dance with in their granddaughter's wedding. At\n5:00 that day, with Derek and Callie keeping vigil at his bedside, the\nmachines were turned off, and Mark Sloan died shortly thereafter. The\n[following episode](/wiki/Remember_the_Time_\\(Grey%27s_Anatomy\\) \"Remember the\nTime \\(Grey's Anatomy\\)\") reveals that he had a surge of good health upon his\nreturn to Seattle Grace before ultimately succumbing to his injuries. His\n'surge' allowed him enough energy to advise his protégé Jackson, 'when you\nlove someone, tell them', which is believed to be a reflection on the major\nobstacle of his failed relationship with Lexie. During this momentary energy,\nMark also took the opportunity to make a clean break with his girlfriend,\nJulia, stating that the situation was not fair to her as he had always loved\nonly Lexie. Following his death, Shonda Rhimes muses regarding Mark and\nLexie's relationship: '...he and Lexie get to be together in a way. Their love\nremains true.”[1] Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital is later renamed Grey\nSloan Memorial Hospital in tribute to Lexie and Mark.\n\n##\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mark_Sloan_\\(Grey%27s_Anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n### Casting and\ncreation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mark_Sloan_\\(Grey%27s_Anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Casting and creation\")]\n\n[![\\[icon\\]](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg) | **This section needs expansion**.
