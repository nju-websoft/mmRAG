Each kidney consists of functional units\ncalled [nephrons](/wiki/Nephrons \"Nephrons\"). The purpose of the renal system\nis to eliminate waste from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure,\ncontrol levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH. The\nkidneys have an extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the\nkidneys via the renal vein. Following filtration of blood and further\nprocessing, wastes (in the form of [urine](/wiki/Urine \"Urine\")) exit the\nkidney via the ureters, tubes made of smooth muscle fibres that propel urine\ntowards the urinary bladder, where it is stored and subsequently expelled from\nthe body by [urination](/wiki/Urination \"Urination\") ([voiding](/wiki/Voiding\n\"Voiding\")). The female and male urinary system are very similar, differing\nonly in the length of the urethra.[1]\n\nUrine is formed in the kidneys through a filtration of [blood](/wiki/Blood\n\"Blood\"). The urine is then passed through the ureters to the bladder, where\nit is stored. During urination, the urine is passed from the bladder through\nthe urethra to the outside of the body.\n\n800–2,000 [milliliters](/wiki/Milliliters \"Milliliters\") (mL) of urine are\nnormally produced every day in a healthy human. This amount varies according\nto fluid intake and kidney function.\n\n![File:Anatomy and physiology of the renal\nsystem.webm](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Anatomy_and_physiology_of_the_renal_system.webm/220px\n--Anatomy_and_physiology_of_the_renal_system.webm.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Anatomy_and_physiology_of_the_renal_system.webm\n\"Play media\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:Anatomy_and_physiology_of_the_renal_system.webm \"Enlarge\")\n\nVideo explanation\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Structure\n    * 1.1 Development\n    * 1.2 Microanatomy\n  * 2 Function\n    * 2.1 Urine formation\n      * 2.1.1 Regulation of concentration and volume\n    * 2.2 Urination\n  * 3 Clinical significance\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Structure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Urinary_system&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Structure\")]\n\nThe urinary system refers to the structures that produce and transport urine\nto the point of excretion. In the human urinary system there are two kidneys\nthat are located between the dorsal body wall and parietal peritoneum on both\nthe left and right sides.\n\nThe formation of urine begins within the functional unit of the kidney, the\nnephrons. Urine then flows through the nephrons, through a system of\nconverging tubules called collecting ducts. These collecting ducts then join\ntogether to form the minor calyces, followed by the major calyces that\nultimately join the renal pelvis. From here, urine continues its flow from the\nrenal pelvis into the ureter, transporting urine into the urinary bladder. The\nanatomy of the human urinary system differs between males and females at the\nlevel of the urinary bladder. In males, the urethra begins at the internal\nurethral orifice in the trigone of the bladder, continues through the external\nurethral orifice, and then becomes the prostatic, membranous, bulbar, and\npenile urethra. Urine exits through the external urethral meatus. The female\nurethra is much shorter, beginning at the bladder neck and terminating in the\nvaginal vestibule.\n\n### Development[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Urinary_system&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nMain article: [Development of the urinary\nsystem](/wiki/Development_of_the_urinary_system \"Development of the urinary\nsystem\")\n\n###\nMicroanatomy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Urinary_system&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Microanatomy\")]\n\nSee also: [Urothelium](/wiki/Urothelium \"Urothelium\")\n\nUnder microscopy, the urinary system is covered in a unique lining called\n[urothelium](/wiki/Urothelium \"Urothelium\"), a type of [transitional\nepithelium](/wiki/Transitional_epithelium \"Transitional epithelium\"). Unlike\nthe [epithelial](/wiki/Epithelium \"Epithelium\") lining of most organs,\ntransitional epithelium can flatten and distend. Urothelium covers most of the\nurinary system, including the renal pelvis, ureters, and bladder.\n\n## Function[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Urinary_system&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Function\")]\n\nThe main functions of the urinary system and it's components are to\n\n  * Regulate [blood volume](/wiki/Blood_volume \"Blood volume\") and composition (e.g. [sodium](/wiki/Sodium \"Sodium\"), [potassium](/wiki/Potassium \"Potassium\") and [calcium](/wiki/Calcium \"Calcium\"))\n  * Regulate [blood pressure](/wiki/Blood_pressure \"Blood pressure\").\n  * Regulate [pH](/wiki/PH \"PH\") [homeostasis](/wiki/Homeostasis \"Homeostasis\") of the blood.\n  * Contributes to the production of red blood cells by the [kidney](/wiki/Kidney \"Kidney\").\n  * Helps synthesize [calcitrol](/wiki/Calcitrol \"Calcitrol\") the (active form of [Vitamin D](/wiki/Vitamin_D \"Vitamin D\")).\n  * Stores waste product (mainly [urea](/wiki/Urea \"Urea\") and [uric acid](/wiki/Uric_acid \"Uric acid\")) before it and other products are removed from the body.\n\n### Urine\nformation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Urinary_system&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Urine formation\")]\n\nAverage urine production in adult humans is about 1–2 [litres](/wiki/Litres\n\"Litres\") (L) per day, depending on state of hydration, activity level,\nenvironmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing too much\nor too little urine requires medical attention. [Polyuria](/wiki/Polyuria\n\"Polyuria\") is a condition of excessive urine production (> 2.5 L/day).\n[Oliguria](/wiki/Oliguria \"Oliguria\") when < 400 mL (millilitres) are\nproduced, and [anuria](/wiki/Anuria \"Anuria\") one of < 100 mL per day.\n\nThe first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood in the kidneys.\nIn a healthy human the kidney receives between 12 and 30% of [cardiac\noutput](/wiki/Cardiac_output \"Cardiac output\"), but it averages about 20% or\nabout 1.25 L/min.\n\nThe basic structural and functional unit of the kidney is the\n[nephron](/wiki/Nephron \"Nephron\"). Its chief function is to regulate the\n[concentration](/wiki/Concentration \"Concentration\") of [water](/wiki/Water\n\"Water\") and soluble substances like [sodium](/wiki/Sodium_salt \"Sodium salt\")\nby filtering the [blood](/wiki/Blood \"Blood\"), reabsorbing what is needed and\nexcreting the rest as [urine](/wiki/Urine \"Urine\").\n\nIn the first part of the nephron, [Bowman's capsule](/wiki/Bowman%27s_capsule\n\"Bowman's capsule\") filters blood from the [circulatory\nsystem](/wiki/Circulatory_system \"Circulatory system\") into the tubules.\nHydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients facilitate filtration across a\nsemipermeable membrane. The filtrate includes water, small molecules, and ions\nthat easily pass through the filtration membrane. However larger molecules\nsuch as [proteins](/wiki/Proteins \"Proteins\") and [blood\ncells](/wiki/Blood_cell \"Blood cell\") are prevented from passing through the\nfiltration membrane. The amount of filtrate produced every minute is called\nthe [glomerular filtration rate](/wiki/Glomerular_filtration_rate \"Glomerular\nfiltration rate\") or GFR and amounts to 180 litres per day. About 99% of this\nfiltrate is reabsorbed as it passes through the nephron and the remaining 1%\nbecomes urine.\n\nThe urinary system is regulated by the [endocrine\nsystem](/wiki/Endocrine_system \"Endocrine system\") by [hormones](/wiki/Hormone\n\"Hormone\") such as [antidiuretic hormone](/wiki/Antidiuretic_hormone\n\"Antidiuretic hormone\"), [aldosterone](/wiki/Aldosterone \"Aldosterone\"), and\n[parathyroid hormone](/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone \"Parathyroid hormone\").[2]\n\n#### Regulation of concentration and\nvolume[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Urinary_system&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Regulation of concentration and volume\")]\n\nThe urinary system is under influence of the [circulatory\nsystem](/wiki/Circulatory_system \"Circulatory system\"), [nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Nervous_system \"Nervous system\"), and [endocrine\nsystem](/wiki/Endocrine_system \"Endocrine system\").\n\n[Aldosterone](/wiki/Aldosterone \"Aldosterone\") plays a central role in\nregulating blood pressure through its effects on the kidney. It acts on the\ndistal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron and increases reabsorption\nof sodium from the glomerular filtrate. Reabsorption of sodium results in\nretention of water, which increases blood pressure and blood volume.\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH), is a [neurohypophysial\nhormone](/wiki/Neurohypophysial_hormone \"Neurohypophysial hormone\") found in\nmost [mammals](/wiki/Mammals \"Mammals\"). Its two primary functions are to\nretain water in the body and [vasoconstriction](/wiki/Vasoconstriction\n\"Vasoconstriction\"). Vasopressin regulates the body's [retention of\nwater](/wiki/Water_retention_\\(medicine\\) \"Water retention \\(medicine\\)\") by\nincreasing water reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney\nnephron.[3] Vasopressin increases water permeability of the kidney's\ncollecting duct and distal convoluted tubule by inducing translocation of\naquaporin-CD water channels in the kidney nephron collecting duct plasma\nmembrane.[4]\n\n### Urination[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Urinary_system&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Urination\")]\n\nMain article: [Urination](/wiki/Urination \"Urination\")\n\nUrination is the ejection of [urine](/wiki/Urine \"Urine\") from the [urinary\nbladder](/wiki/Urinary_bladder \"Urinary bladder\") through the\n[urethra](/wiki/Urethra \"Urethra\") to the outside of the body. In healthy\nhumans (and [many other animals](/wiki/Urination#Animals \"Urination\")), the\nprocess of urination is under voluntary control. In infants, some elderly\nindividuals, and those with neurological injury, urination may occur as an\ninvoluntary [reflex](/wiki/Reflex \"Reflex\"). Physiologically, micturition\ninvolves coordination between the [central](/wiki/Central_nervous_system\n\"Central nervous system\"), [autonomic](/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system\n\"Autonomic nervous system\"), and [somatic nervous\nsystems](/wiki/Somatic_nervous_system \"Somatic nervous system\"). Brain centers\nthat regulate urination include the [pontine micturition\ncenter](/wiki/Pontine_micturition_center \"Pontine micturition center\"),\n[periaqueductal gray](/wiki/Periaqueductal_gray \"Periaqueductal gray\"), and\nthe [cerebral cortex](/wiki/Cerebral_cortex \"Cerebral cortex\"). In [placental\nmammals](/wiki/Placentalia \"Placentalia\") the male ejects urine through the\n[penis](/wiki/Penis \"Penis\"), and the female through the [vulva](/wiki/Vulva\n\"Vulva\").\n\n## Clinical\nsignificance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Urinary_system&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Clinical significance\")]\n\nMain article: [Urologic disease](/wiki/Urologic_disease \"Urologic disease\")\n\n[Urologic disease](/wiki/Urologic_disease \"Urologic disease\") can involve\ncongenital or acquired dysfunction of the urinary system.\n\nDiseases of the kidney tissue are normally treated by\n[nephrologists](/wiki/Nephrologist \"Nephrologist\"), while disease of the\nurinary tract are treated by [urologists](/wiki/Urologist \"Urologist\").\n[Gynecologists](/wiki/Gynecology \"Gynecology\") may also treat female urinary\nincontinence.\n\nDiseases of other bodily systems also have a direct effect on urogenital\nfunction. For instance it has been shown that [protein](/wiki/Protein\n\"Protein\") released by the kidneys in [diabetes\nmellitus](/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus \"Diabetes mellitus\") sensitises the kidney\nto the damaging effects of [hypertension](/wiki/Hypertension\n\"Hypertension\").[5]\n\n[Diabetes](/wiki/Diabetes \"Diabetes\") also can have a direct effect in\n[urination](/wiki/Urination \"Urination\") due to [peripheral\nneuropathies](/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy \"Peripheral neuropathy\") which occur\nin some individuals with poorly controlled diabetes.[6]\n\n[Urinary incontinence](/wiki/Urinary_incontinence \"Urinary incontinence\") can\nresult from a weakening of the [pelvic floor](/wiki/Pelvic_floor \"Pelvic\nfloor\") muscles caused by factors such as [pregnancy](/wiki/Pregnancy\n\"Pregnancy\"), [childbirth](/wiki/Childbirth \"Childbirth\"),\n[aging](/wiki/Ageing \"Ageing\") and being [overweight](/wiki/Overweight\n\"Overweight\"). Pelvic floor exercises known as [Kegel\nexercises](/wiki/Kegel_exercise \"Kegel exercise\") can help in this condition\nby strengthening the pelvic floor. There can also be underlying medical\nreasons for urinary incontinence which are often treatable. In children the\ncondition is called [enuresis](/wiki/Enuresis \"Enuresis\").\n\nSome cancers also target the urinary system, including [bladder\ncancer](/wiki/Bladder_cancer \"Bladder cancer\"), [kidney\ncancer](/wiki/Kidney_cancer \"Kidney cancer\"), [uteral\ncancer](/w/index.php?title=Uteral_cancer&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Uteral cancer\n\\(page does not exist\\)\"), and [urethral cancer](/wiki/Urethral_cancer\n\"Urethral cancer\"). Due to the role and location of these organs, treatment is\noften complicated.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Urinary_system&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Major systems of the human body](/wiki/Major_systems_of_the_human_body \"Major systems of the human body\")\n\n  * [![WHO Rod.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/WHO_Rod.svg/9px-WHO_Rod.svg.png)](/wiki/File:WHO_Rod.svg)[Medicine portal](/wiki/Portal:Medicine \"Portal:Medicine\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Urinary_system&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** C.
