B. White](/wiki/E._B._White\n\"E. B. White\") and illustrated by [Garth Williams](/wiki/Garth_Williams \"Garth\nWilliams\"); it was published in October 15, 1952, by [Harper &\nBrothers](/wiki/Harper_%26_Brothers \"Harper & Brothers\"). The novel tells the\nstory of a [pig](/wiki/Pig \"Pig\") named Wilbur and his friendship with a [barn\nspider](/wiki/Barn_spider \"Barn spider\") named Charlotte. When Wilbur is in\ndanger of being slaughtered by the farmer, Charlotte writes messages praising\nWilbur (such as \"Some Pig\") in her web in order to persuade the farmer to let\nhim live.\n\nWritten in White's dry, low-key manner, _Charlotte 's Web_ is considered a\nclassic of children's literature, enjoyable to adults as well as children. The\ndescription of the experience of swinging on a rope swing at the farm is an\noften cited example of rhythm in writing, as the pace of the sentences\nreflects the motion of the swing. In 2000, _[Publishers\nWeekly](/wiki/Publishers_Weekly \"Publishers Weekly\")_ listed the book as the\nbest-selling children's paperback of all time.[1]\n\n_Charlotte 's Web_ was adapted into an [animated\nfeature](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_\\(1973_film\\) \"Charlotte's Web \\(1973\nfilm\\)\") by [Hanna-Barbera Productions](/wiki/Hanna-Barbera_Productions\n\"Hanna-Barbera Productions\") and Sagittarius Productions in 1973. Paramount\nreleased a [direct-to-video](/wiki/Direct-to-video \"Direct-to-video\")\n[sequel](/wiki/Sequel \"Sequel\"), _[Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great\nAdventure](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_2:_Wilbur%27s_Great_Adventure \"Charlotte's\nWeb 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure\")_, in the U.S. in 2003 (Universal released\nthe film internationally). A [live-action film\nversion](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_\\(2006_film\\) \"Charlotte's Web \\(2006\nfilm\\)\") of E. B. White's original story was released in 2006. A [video game\nbased on this adaption](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_\\(video_game\\) \"Charlotte's\nWeb \\(video game\\)\") was also released in 2006.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot summary\n  * 2 Characters\n  * 3 History\n  * 4 Reception\n  * 5 Adaptations\n    * 5.1 Film\n    * 5.2 Stage\n    * 5.3 Video game\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 Further reading\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Plot summary\n\nAfter her father spares the life of a piglet from slaughtering it as\n[runt](/wiki/Runt \"Runt\") of the litter, a little girl named Fern Arable\nnurtures the piglet lovingly, naming him Wilbur. On greater maturity, Wilbur\nis sold to Fern's uncle, Homer Zuckerman, in whose barnyard he is left\nyearning for companionship but is snubbed by other barn animals, until\nbefriended by a [barn spider](/wiki/Barn_spider \"Barn spider\") named\nCharlotte, living on a web overlooking Wilbur's enclosure. Upon Wilbur's\ndiscovery that he is intended for slaughter, she promises to hatch a plan\nguaranteed to spare his life. Accordingly, she secretly weaves praise of him\ninto her web, attracting publicity among Zuckerman's neighbors who attribute\nthe praise to [divine intervention](/wiki/Miracle \"Miracle\"). As time passes,\nmore inscriptions appear on Charlotte's webs, increasing his renown.\nTherefore, Wilbur is entered in the county fair, accompanied by Charlotte and\nthe rat Templeton, whom she employs in gathering inspiration for her messages.\nThere, Charlotte spins an egg sac containing her unborn offspring, and Wilbur,\ndespite winning no prizes, is later celebrated by the fair's staff and\nvisitors (thus made too prestigious alive to justify killing him). Exhausted\napparently by laying eggs, Charlotte remains at the fair and dies shortly\nafter Wilbur's departure. Having returned to Zuckerman's farm, Wilbur guards\nCharlotte's egg sac and is saddened further when the new spiders depart\nshortly after hatching. The three smallest remain, however. Pleased at finding\nnew friends, Wilbur names the spiderlings Joy, Nellie, and Aranea, and the\nbook concludes by mentioning that more generations of spiders kept him company\nin subsequent years.\n\n## Characters\n\n  * **Wilbur** is a rambunctious [pig](/wiki/Pig \"Pig\"), the [runt](/wiki/Runt \"Runt\") of his [litter](/wiki/Litter_\\(animal\\) \"Litter \\(animal\\)\"). He is often strongly emotional.\n  * **Charlotte A. Cavatica** , or simply Charlotte, is a [spider](/wiki/Spider \"Spider\") who befriends Wilbur. In some passages, she is the [heroine](/wiki/Heroine \"Heroine\") of the story.[2]\n  * **John Arable** : Wilbur's first owner.\n  * **Fern Arable** , John's daughter, who adopts Wilbur in his infancy, and later visits him. She is the only human in the story capable of understanding nonhuman conversation.\n  * **Templeton** is a [rat](/wiki/Rat \"Rat\") who helps Charlotte and Wilbur only when offered food. He serves as a somewhat caustic, self-serving [comic relief](/wiki/Comic_relief \"Comic relief\") to the plot.\n  * **Avery Arable** is the elder brother of Fern. Like Templeton, he is a source of comic relief.\n  * **Homer Zuckerman** is Fern’s uncle who keeps Wilbur in his barn. He has a wife, Edith, and an assistant named Lurvy.\n  * **Other animals** in Zuckerman’s barn, with whom Wilbur converses, are a disdainful lamb, a talkative goose, and an intelligent \"old [sheep](/wiki/Sheep \"Sheep\")\".\n  * **Henry Fussy** is a boy of Fern’s age, of whom Fern becomes fond.\n  * **Dr. Dorian** is the family physician/psychologist consulted by Fern's mother and something of a [wise old man](/wiki/Wise_old_man \"Wise old man\") character.\n  * **Uncle** is a large pig whom Charlotte disdains for coarse manners and Wilbur’s rival at the fair.\n\n## History\n\nWhite's editor Ursula Nordstrom said that one day, in 1952, E. B. White handed\nher a new manuscript, the only version of _Charlotte 's Web_ then in\nexistence, which she read soon after and enjoyed.[3] _Charlotte 's Web_ was\npublished three years after White began writing it.[4]\n\nSince White published _Death of a Pig_ in 1948,[5] an account of his own\nfailure to save a sick pig (bought for butchering), _Charlotte 's Web_ can be\nseen as White's attempt \"to save his pig in retrospect\".[6] White's overall\nmotivation for the book has not been revealed and he has written: \"I haven't\ntold why I wrote the book, but I haven't told you why I sneeze, either. A book\nis a sneeze\".[7]\n\nWhen White met the spider who originally inspired Charlotte, he called her\nCharlotte Epeira (after _Epeira sclopetaria_ , the Grey Cross spider, now\nknown as _[Larinioides sclopetarius](/wiki/Larinioides_sclopetarius\n\"Larinioides sclopetarius\")_), before discovering that the more modern name\nfor that genus was _Aranea_.[8] In the novel, Charlotte gives her full name as\n\"Charlotte A. Cavatica\", revealing her as a [barn spider](/wiki/Barn_spider\n\"Barn spider\"), an [orb-weaver](/wiki/Orb-weaver_spider \"Orb-weaver spider\")\nwith the scientific name _Araneus cavaticus_.\n\nThe arachnid anatomical terms (mentioned in the beginning of chapter nine) and\nother information that White used, came mostly from _American Spiders_ by\n[Willis J. Gertsch](/wiki/Willis_J._Gertsch \"Willis J. Gertsch\") and _The\nSpider Book_ by [John Henry Comstock](/wiki/John_Henry_Comstock \"John Henry\nComstock\"), both of which combine a sense of poetry with scientific fact.[9]\nWhite incorporated details from Comstock's accounts of baby spiders, most\nnotably the \"flight\" of the young spiders on silken parachutes.[9] White sent\nGertsch’s book to illustrator Garth Williams.[10] Williams’ initial drawings\ndepicted a spider with a woman’s face, and White suggested that he simply draw\na realistic spider instead.[11]\n\nWhite originally opened the novel with an introduction of Wilbur and the\nbarnyard (which later became the third chapter) but decided to begin the novel\nby introducing Fern and her family on the first page.[10] White’s publishers\nwere at one point concerned with the book’s ending and tried to get White to\nchange it.[12]\n\n_Charlotte 's Web_ has become White's most famous book; but White treasured\nhis privacy and that of the farmyard and barn that helped inspire the novel,\nwhich have been kept off limits to the public according to his wishes.[13]\n\n## Reception\n\n_Charlotte 's Web_ was generally well-reviewed when it was released. In _The\nNew York Times_ , [Eudora Welty](/wiki/Eudora_Welty \"Eudora Welty\") wrote, \"As\na piece of work it is just about perfect, and just about magical in the way it\nis done.\"[14] Aside from its paperback sales, _Charlotte 's Web_ is 78th on\nthe all-time bestselling hardback book list. According to publicity for the\n2006 film adaptation (see below), the book has sold more than 45 million\ncopies and been translated into 23 languages. It was a [Newbery\nHonor](/wiki/Newbery_Honor \"Newbery Honor\") book for 1953, losing to _[Secret\nof the Andes](/wiki/Secret_of_the_Andes \"Secret of the Andes\")_ by [Ann Nolan\nClark](/wiki/Ann_Nolan_Clark \"Ann Nolan Clark\") for the\n[medal](/wiki/Newbery_Medal \"Newbery Medal\"). In 1970, White won the [Laura\nIngalls Wilder Medal](/wiki/Laura_Ingalls_Wilder_Medal \"Laura Ingalls Wilder\nMedal\"), a major prize in the field of children's literature, for _Charlotte\n's Web_, along with his first children's book, _[Stuart\nLittle](/wiki/Stuart_Little \"Stuart Little\")_ , published in 1945. Seth Lerer,\nin his book _Children’s Literature_ , finds that Charlotte represents female\nauthorship and creativity, and compares her to other female characters in\nchildren’s literature such as Jo March in _[Little Women](/wiki/Little_Women\n\"Little Women\")_ and Mary Lennox in _[The Secret\nGarden](/wiki/The_Secret_Garden \"The Secret Garden\")_.[15] Nancy Larrick\nbrings to attention the \"startling note of realism\" in the opening line,\n\"Where's Papa going with that Ax?\"[16]\n\nIllustrator [Henry Cole](/wiki/Henry_Cole_\\(illustrator\\) \"Henry Cole\n\\(illustrator\\)\") expressed his deep childhood appreciation of the characters\nand story, and calls Garth Williams' illustrations full of “sensitivity,\nwarmth, humor, and intelligence.”[17] Illustrator Diana Cain Bluthenthal\nstates that Williams' illustrations inspired and influenced her.[18]\n\nThere is an unabridged audio book read by White himself which reappeared\ndecades after it had originally been recorded.[19] _Newsweek_ writes that\nWhite reads the story \"without artifice and with a mellow charm,\" and that\n\"White also has a plangency that will make you weep, so don't listen (at\nleast, not to the sad parts) while driving.\"[19] Joe Berk, president of\nPathway Sound, had recorded _Charlotte 's Web_ with White in White’s\nneighbor's house in Maine (which Berk describes as an especially memorable\nexperience) and released the book in LP.[20] Bantam released _Charlotte’s Web_\nalongside _Stuart Little_ on CD in 1991, digitally remastered, having acquired\nthe two of them for rather a large amount.[20]\n\nIn 2005, a school teacher in California conceived of a project for her class\nin which they would send out hundreds of drawings of spiders (each\nrepresenting Charlotte’s child Aranea going out into the world so that she can\nreturn and tell Wilbur of what she has seen) with accompanying letters; they\nended up visiting a large number of parks, monuments, and museums, and were\nhosted by and/or prompted responses from celebrities and politicians such as\n[John Travolta](/wiki/John_Travolta \"John Travolta\") and then-First Lady\n[Laura Bush](/wiki/Laura_Bush \"Laura Bush\").[21]\n\nIn 2003 _Charlotte 's Web_ was listed at number 170 on the BBC's [The Big\nRead](/wiki/The_Big_Read \"The Big Read\") poll of the UK's 200 \"best-loved\nnovels.\"[22] A 2004 study found that _Charlotte 's Web_ was a common read-\naloud book for third-graders in schools in [San Diego County,\nCalifornia](/wiki/San_Diego_County,_California \"San Diego County,\nCalifornia\").[23] Based on a 2007 online poll, the [National Education\nAssociation](/wiki/National_Education_Association \"National Education\nAssociation\") named the book one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for\nChildren.\"[24] It was one of the \"Top 100 Chapter Books\" of all time in a 2012\npoll by _[School Library Journal](/wiki/School_Library_Journal \"School Library\nJournal\")_.[25]\n\nIts awards and nominations include:\n\n  * [Newbery Honor Book](/wiki/Newbery_Honor_Book \"Newbery Honor Book\") (1953)[26]\n  * [Horn Book Fanfare](/wiki/The_Horn_Book_Magazine \"The Horn Book Magazine\") (1953)[27]\n  * [Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal](/wiki/Laura_Ingalls_Wilder_Medal \"Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal\") (1970) (awarded to White for his children's books: _Charlotte 's Web_ and _Stuart Little_)\n  * [Massachusetts Children's Book Award](/wiki/Massachusetts_Children%27s_Book_Award \"Massachusetts Children's Book Award\") (1984)[28]\n\n## Adaptations\n\n### Film\n\nThe book was adapted [into an animated feature of the same\nname](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_\\(1973_film\\) \"Charlotte's Web \\(1973 film\\)\")\nin 1973 by [Hanna-Barbera Productions](/wiki/Hanna-Barbera_Productions \"Hanna-\nBarbera Productions\") and Sagittarius Productions with a score by the [Sherman\nBrothers](/wiki/Sherman_Brothers \"Sherman Brothers\"). In 2003, a [direct-to-\nvideo](/wiki/Direct-to-video \"Direct-to-video\") sequel of that film,\n_[Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great\nAdventure](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_2:_Wilbur%27s_Great_Adventure \"Charlotte's\nWeb 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure\"),_ was released by [Paramount\nPictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount Pictures\"). In 2006, Paramount\nPictures, with [Walden Media](/wiki/Walden_Media \"Walden Media\"), Kerner\nEntertainment Company, and [Nickelodeon Movies](/wiki/Nickelodeon_Movies\n\"Nickelodeon Movies\"), produced [a live-action/animated\nadaptation](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_\\(2006_film\\) \"Charlotte's Web \\(2006\nfilm\\)\") starring [Dakota Fanning](/wiki/Dakota_Fanning \"Dakota Fanning\") as\nFern and the voice of [Julia Roberts](/wiki/Julia_Roberts \"Julia Roberts\") as\nCharlotte, released on December 15, 2006.\n\n### Stage\n\nMain article: [Charlotte's Web (musical)](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_\\(musical\\)\n\"Charlotte's Web \\(musical\\)\")\n\nA musical production was created with music and lyrics by [Charles\nStrouse](/wiki/Charles_Strouse \"Charles Strouse\").\n\n### Video game\n\nMain article: [Charlotte's Web (video\ngame)](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_\\(video_game\\) \"Charlotte's Web \\(video\ngame\\)\")\n\nA [video game](/wiki/Video_game \"Video game\") of the [2006\nfilm](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_\\(2006_film\\) \"Charlotte's Web \\(2006 film\\)\")\nwas developed by [Backbone Entertainment](/wiki/Backbone_Entertainment\n\"Backbone Entertainment\") and published by [THQ](/wiki/THQ \"THQ\") and\n[Sega](/wiki/Sega \"Sega\"), and released on December 12, 2006, for the [Game\nBoy Advance](/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance \"Game Boy Advance\"), [Nintendo\nDS](/wiki/Nintendo_DS \"Nintendo DS\"), [PlayStation 2](/wiki/PlayStation_2\n\"PlayStation 2\") and [PC](/wiki/Personal_computer \"Personal computer\").\n\n## See also\n\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png)[United States portal](/wiki/Portal:United_States \"Portal:United States\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Tom_Sawyer_1876_frontispiece.jpg/20px-Tom_Sawyer_1876_frontispiece.jpg)[Children's literature portal](/wiki/Portal:Children%27s_literature \"Portal:Children's literature\")\n\n  * [List of best-selling books](/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books \"List of best-selling books\")\n  * _[The Tale of Little Pig Robinson](/wiki/The_Tale_of_Little_Pig_Robinson \"The Tale of Little Pig Robinson\")_\n  * \"[Low THC cannabis (\"Charlotte's web\")](/wiki/Low_THC_cannabis_\\(%22Charlotte%27s_web%22\\) \"Low THC cannabis \\(\"Charlotte's web\"\\)\")\n  * [Death in children’s literature](/wiki/Death_in_children%E2%80%99s_literature \"Death in children’s literature\")\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Private Tutor\"](http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0203050.html).
