        "# When pigs fly\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nFor the sketch comedy group, see [The Flying Pigs](/wiki/The_Flying_Pigs \"The\nFlying Pigs\").\n\nFor other uses, see [When Pigs Fly\n(disambiguation)](/wiki/When_Pigs_Fly_\\(disambiguation\\) \"When Pigs Fly\n\\(disambiguation\\)\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Sus_scrofa_avionica.png/220px-\nSus_scrofa_avionica.png)](/wiki/File:Sus_scrofa_avionica.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sus_scrofa_avionica.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [doctored photograph](/wiki/Photo_manipulation \"Photo manipulation\") showing\na winged pig\n\nThe phrase \"**when pigs fly** \" (alternatively, \"**pigs might fly** \") is an\n[adynaton](/wiki/Adynaton \"Adynaton\")—a [figure of\nspeech](/wiki/Figure_of_speech \"Figure of speech\") so\n[hyperbolic](/wiki/Hyperbole \"Hyperbole\") that it describes an impossibility.\nThe implication of such a phrase is that the circumstances in question (the\nadynaton, and the circumstances to which the adynaton is being applied) will\nnever occur.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Meaning\n  * 2 In popular culture\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n## Meaning[[edit](/w/index.php?title=When_pigs_fly&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Meaning\")]\n\n\"When pigs fly\" is an [adynaton](/wiki/Adynaton \"Adynaton\"), a way of saying\nthat something will never happen. The phrase is often used for\n[humorous](/wiki/Humor \"Humor\") effect, to scoff at over-ambition. There are\nnumerous variations on the theme; when an individual with a reputation for\nfailure finally succeeds, onlookers may [sarcastically](/wiki/Sarcasm\n\"Sarcasm\") claim to see a flying [pig](/wiki/Pig \"Pig\"). (\"Hey look! A flying\npig!\") [1] Other variations on the phrase include \"And pigs will fly\", this\none in retort to an outlandish statement.\n\nAn example occurs in the film _[The Eagle Has\nLanded](/wiki/The_Eagle_Has_Landed_\\(film\\) \"The Eagle Has Landed \\(film\\)\")_\n: an Irish [secret agent](/wiki/Secret_agent \"Secret agent\") working for the\n[Nazis](/wiki/Nazis \"Nazis\") replies to a German general speaking of\n[Germany](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\")'s shortly winning [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), \"Pigs may fly, General, but I doubt\nit!\" Later, when the Irishman sees German soldiers parachuting before an\nattack, he says to himself, \"Mother of God! Flying pigs!\"\n\nAn identical phrase, used to express impossibilities, exists in\n[Romanian](/wiki/Romanian_language \"Romanian language\"), _Când o zbura porcul_\n, literally meaning \"When the pig shall fly\"; an equivalent also implying an\nanimal is _La Paștele cailor_ , literally: \"on horses' Easter\". Similar\nphrases in English include \"[when hell freezes\nover](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/when_Hell_freezes_over \"wiktionary:when\nHell freezes over\")\", the Latin expression \"to the Greek\n[calends](/wiki/Calends \"Calends\")\", and \"and monkeys might fly out of my\nbutt\", popularized in [Wayne's World](/wiki/Wayne%27s_World \"Wayne's World\")\nskits and movies. They are examples of [adynata](/wiki/Adynata \"Adynata\").[2]\nIn [Finnish](/wiki/Finnish_language \"Finnish language\"), the expression \"_kun\nlehmät lentävät_ \" (when cows fly) is used because of its\n[alliteration](/wiki/Alliteration \"Alliteration\"). In French, the most common\nexpression is \"_quand les poules auront des dents_ \" (when hens will have\nteeth).\n\nIn [Polish](/wiki/Polish_language \"Polish language\"), a similar expression is\n\"See a tank rolling in here?\", while simultaneously lowering a lower eyelid\nwith a finger. Sometimes, when in return to this a slightly more limited, but\nstill improbable answer is given, the speaker repeats the gesture, stating:\n\"Maybe at least a [gun barrel](/wiki/Gun_barrel \"Gun barrel\") sticks out?\":\n\n  * \"I'm sure that the cows will make a permanent colony on the Moon by the end of 2012.\"\n  * \"Yeah, sure. See a tank rolling in here?\" (lowering the eyelid)\n  * \"Well, maybe not 2012, but 2013, surely.\"\n  * \"Maybe at least a gun barrel sticks out?\" (repeating the gesture.)\n\nThe idiom is apparently derived from a centuries-old Scottish proverb, though\nsome other references to pigs flying or pigs with wings are more famous. At\nleast one appears in the works of [Lewis Carroll](/wiki/Lewis_Carroll \"Lewis\nCarroll\"):\n\n> \"Thinking again?\" the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little\n> chin.  \n>  \"I've a right to think,\" said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel\n> a little worried.  \n>  \"Just about as much right,\" said the Duchess, \"as pigs have to fly....\" —\n> [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\n> \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\"), Chapter 9.\n\n[American literature](/wiki/American_literature \"American literature\") author\n[John Steinbeck](/wiki/John_Steinbeck \"John Steinbeck\") was told by his\nprofessor that he would be an author when pigs flew. When he eventually became\na novelist, he started to print every book he wrote with the insignia \"[Ad\nastra](/wiki/Ad_astra_\\(phrase\\) \"Ad astra \\(phrase\\)\") per alas porci\" (to\nthe stars on the wings of a pig).[3] He sometimes added an image of a flying\npig, called \"[Pigasus](/wiki/Pigasus_\\(literature\\) \"Pigasus\n\\(literature\\)\")\".\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=When_pigs_fly&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: In popular culture\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Fliegende_Schweine.jpg/220px-\nFliegende_Schweine.jpg)](/wiki/File:Fliegende_Schweine.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Fliegende_Schweine.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Fliegende Schweine_ by [Michael Maschka](/wiki/Michael_Maschka \"Michael\nMaschka\")\n\n  * In [Lewis Carroll](/wiki/Lewis_Carroll \"Lewis Carroll\")'s _[Through the Looking-Glass](/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass \"Through the Looking-Glass\")_ (1872), the poem \"[The Walrus and the Carpenter](/wiki/The_Walrus_and_the_Carpenter \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\")\" poses the question of \"whether pigs have wings\".\n  * [Pigasus](/wiki/Pigasus_\\(literature\\) \"Pigasus \\(literature\\)\") was a flying pig character in the [_Oz_ books](/wiki/Oz_books \"Oz books\") written by [Ruth Plumly Thompson](/wiki/Ruth_Plumly_Thompson \"Ruth Plumly Thompson\") in the 1930s.[4]\n  * Because of the historical importance of the pig industry to the city, prominent in the local iconography of [Cincinnati](/wiki/Cincinnati \"Cincinnati\")[5] (nicknamed 'Porkopolis') are such events as the [Big Pig Gig](/wiki/Big_Pig_Gig \"Big Pig Gig\") and the [Flying Pig Marathon](/wiki/Flying_Pig_Marathon \"Flying Pig Marathon\"). Public art around town features flying pigs.\n  * In [Grand Prairie, TX](/wiki/Grand_Prairie,_TX \"Grand Prairie, TX\"), the semi-pro baseball team is the ([Grand Prairie AirHogs](/wiki/Grand_Prairie_AirHogs \"Grand Prairie AirHogs\")). In advertising, they have used the slogan \"Where Hogs fly\".\n  * In the 1968 movie _[The Lion in Winter](/wiki/The_Lion_in_Winter_\\(1968_film\\) \"The Lion in Winter \\(1968 film\\)\")_ , King Henry II tells his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine \"When pigs have wings!\". She replies \"There'll be pork in the trees come morning!\"\n  * [Pink Floyd](/wiki/Pink_Floyd \"Pink Floyd\") had a flying pig on the cover of the _[Animals](/wiki/Animals_\\(Pink_Floyd_album\\) \"Animals \\(Pink Floyd album\\)\")_ album. This clearly ties in with the album's songs \"Pigs On The Wing\". Since then the group has used a flying pig as a prop for concerts. _See[Pink Floyd pigs](/wiki/Pink_Floyd_pigs \"Pink Floyd pigs\")._\n    * This album cover is one of the many cultural references in the game [Jet Set Willy](/wiki/Jet_Set_Willy \"Jet Set Willy\"); the Emergency Power Generator is a miniature indoor version of [Battersea Power Station](/wiki/Battersea_Power_Station \"Battersea Power Station\") with a pig flying over it. That flying-pig sprite is also used in several other rooms.\n  * In _[Alice](/wiki/Alice_\\(TV_series\\) \"Alice \\(TV series\\)\")_ , a popular TV series based on the 1974 movie _[Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More](/wiki/Alice_Doesn%27t_Live_Here_Any_More \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More\")_. Alice ([Linda Lavin](/wiki/Linda_Lavin \"Linda Lavin\")) worked at Mel's Diner along with a spunky waitress named Flo ([Polly Holliday](/wiki/Polly_Holliday \"Polly Holliday\")). Flo spoke with a southern twang, and one of her favorite sayings was, \"When Pigs Fly!\"\n  * In _[The Simpsons](/wiki/The_Simpsons \"The Simpsons\")_ episode, \"[Lisa the Vegetarian](/wiki/Lisa_the_Vegetarian \"Lisa the Vegetarian\")\", Lisa pushes Homer's prize pig down a hill into a river, where it ends up getting shot through the air by a dam's spillway suction. In his office [Mr. Burns](/wiki/Mr._Burns \"Mr. Burns\") says to [Smithers](/wiki/Smithers \"Smithers\") he would like to do something charitable with his wealth, donating a million dollars to the orphanage. Smithers becomes confused at this, and Burns answers \"when pigs fly\". The pig then passes his window in flight, much to their surprise, at which point he admits he would still like to keep his money.\n  * In the [Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game](/wiki/Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World:_The_Game \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game\") subspace highway screens, players may be rewarded with money by destroying flying Piggy Banks.\n  * In [Hexen](/wiki/Hexen:_Beyond_Heretic \"Hexen: Beyond Heretic\") the player can be turned into a pig and use wings of wrath, this results in a flying pig.\n  * [Arjen Anthony Lucassen](/wiki/Arjen_Anthony_Lucassen \"Arjen Anthony Lucassen\")'s second solo album, [Lost in the New Real](/wiki/Lost_in_the_New_Real \"Lost in the New Real\") features a track titled \"Where pigs fly\".\n  * In the UK BBC One series called [ShakespeaRe-Told](/wiki/ShakespeaRe-Told \"ShakespeaRe-Told\") adaptation of [Macbeth](/wiki/Macbeth \"Macbeth\"), the character Joe Macbeth's monologue \"Is that a [police] helicopter? Is it landing on this building? Pigs will fly! Pigs will fly!\" It is the film's translation of \"[The Birnam Wood](/wiki/The_Birnam_Wood \"The Birnam Wood\")\" reference to the warning given to Macbeth in the Shakespeare play of the same name, in which he is warned that \"Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until / Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill / Shall come against him.\"\n  * After the [New Orleans Saints](/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints \"New Orleans Saints\"), long known for their lack of success, won the [2009](/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_NFL_playoffs \"2009–10 NFL playoffs\") [NFC Championship Game](/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game \"NFC Championship Game\") by making a [field goal](/wiki/Field_goal_\\(American_and_Canadian_football\\) \"Field goal \\(American and Canadian football\\)\") in [sudden death](/wiki/Sudden_death_\\(sport\\) \"Sudden death \\(sport\\)\") [overtime](/wiki/Overtime_\\(sports\\) \"Overtime \\(sports\\)\"), longtime Saints radio announcer [Jim Henderson](/wiki/Jim_Henderson_\\(sportscaster\\) \"Jim Henderson \\(sportscaster\\)\") exclaimed, \"Pigs have flown! Hell has frozen over! The Saints are on their way to the [Super Bowl](/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\")!\"[6]\n  * Flying pigs were seen in the film _[Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang](/wiki/Nanny_McPhee_and_the_Big_Bang \"Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang\")_ and were a large part of the promotion related to it, including its major promotional posters. The original _[Nanny McPhee](/wiki/Nanny_McPhee \"Nanny McPhee\")_ film had featured the phrase \"snow in August\" as a similar reference to something that was supposed to be impossible.\n  * The cover of [Stephen Colbert](/wiki/Stephen_Colbert \"Stephen Colbert\")'s adult-targeted picture book _[I Am a Pole (And So Can You!)](/wiki/I_Am_a_Pole_\\(And_So_Can_You!\\) \"I Am a Pole \\(And So Can You!\\)\")_ features an emblem stating that it is a \"[Caldecott](/wiki/Caldecott_Medal \"Caldecott Medal\") Eligible Book\" and a picture of Colbert riding a flying pig, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the book's actual likelihood of being nominated for this award.\n  * In the third season of the Canadian sketch comedy series _[The Kids in the Hall](/wiki/The_Kids_in_the_Hall \"The Kids in the Hall\")_ , a flying pig (portrayed by [Bruce McCulloch](/wiki/Bruce_McCulloch \"Bruce McCulloch\")) appeared in several sketches to entertain people who had been waiting in long lines.[7]\n  * In Eminem's 2013 song \"[Legacy](/wiki/Legacy_\\(Eminem_song\\) \"Legacy \\(Eminem song\\)\")\", a variant phrase of this is said: \"The day you beat me, pigs will fly out my ass into a flying saucer full of Italian sausage!\"\n  * In _[The 7D](/wiki/The_7D \"The 7D\")_ episode \"When Pigs Fly\", Hildy and Grim Gloom use a spell to give the pigs owned by the farmer Zoinky McZoinks wings and control them as part of their plan to eat all the food in Jollywood in order to cause its citizens to head to Hildegard Estates to become their minions. The 7D managed to thwart the plan by coating the Glooms' house in chocolate. By the end of the episode, the flying pigs were returned to Zoinky McZoinks who managed to make some money off the flying pigs.\n  * In _[Star vs. the Forces of Evil](/wiki/Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\")_ episode \"Brittney's Party\", Brittney Wong told Star that she will be invited to her birthday party \"when pigs fly\". Star took it literally and used her wand to create an actual flying pig in order to get invited.\n  * On the wall of a building along Biscayne Blvd. near 81st St. in Miami, Florida (see illustration).\n  * In a self-effacing reference to their less-than-stellar record, the [log canoe](/wiki/Log_canoe \"Log canoe\") [Edmee S.](/wiki/Edmee_S. \"Edmee S.\") has adopted a flying pig as their mascot.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=When_pigs_fly&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Pigs might fly\"](http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-pig1.htm).
