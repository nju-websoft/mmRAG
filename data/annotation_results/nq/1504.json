The jurisdiction\nof that court covered [undivided Punjab](/wiki/Punjab_region \"Punjab region\")\nand [Delhi](/wiki/Delhi \"Delhi\"). From 1920 to 1943, the Court was conferred\nwith [extraterritorial jurisdiction](/wiki/Extraterritorial_jurisdiction\n\"Extraterritorial jurisdiction\") over that part of [China](/wiki/China\n\"China\") that formed part of the British consular district of\n[Kashgar](/wiki/Kashgar \"Kashgar\"), which had previously been under the\njurisdiction of the [British Supreme Court for\nChina](/wiki/British_Supreme_Court_for_China \"British Supreme Court for\nChina\").[6] This ceased upon the ratification of the [British-Chinese Treaty\nfor the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China](/wiki/British-\nChinese_Treaty_for_the_Relinquishment_of_Extra-Territorial_Rights_in_China\n\"British-Chinese Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in\nChina\").[7]\n\nFollowing the [independence of India](/wiki/Independence_of_India\n\"Independence of India\") on 15 August 1947, a separate High Court of Punjab\nwas created, based at [Shimla](/wiki/Shimla \"Shimla\"). This had jurisdiction\nover [Indian Punjab](/wiki/Punjab,_India \"Punjab, India\"), Delhi and what are\nnow [Himachal Pradesh](/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh \"Himachal Pradesh\") and Haryana.\nFrom 17 January 1955, the Court was moved to its present location in\nChandigarh.\n\nThe creation of Himachal Pradesh on 15 August 1948 led to a separate Court of\nJudicial Commissioner (similar to a High Court) being established for that\nstate and thus the jurisdiction of the Punjab court was reduced. A separate\nHigh Court was constituted for the [Union Territory of\nDelhi](/wiki/Union_Territory_of_Delhi \"Union Territory of Delhi\") under the\n_Delhi High Court Act, 1966_.[8] Three Judges of the Punjab High Court were\ntransferred to the [Delhi High Court](/wiki/Delhi_High_Court \"Delhi High\nCourt\"), which was constituted on 31 October 1966.\n\nThe _[States Reorganisation Act, 1956](/wiki/States_Reorganisation_Act,_1956\n\"States Reorganisation Act, 1956\")_ paved the way for the formation of Haryana\nand the Union Territory of Chandigarh from 1 November 1966. Those formations\nalso saw the renaming of the High Court of Punjab as the High Court of Punjab\nand Haryana. The Judges of the High Court of Punjab became Judges of the\ncommon High Court with all the powers and jurisdiction of the High Court of\nPunjab. However, the principal seat of the High Court remained at Chandigarh.\n\nThe High Court of Punjab and Haryana has operated since 1 November 1966 in its\npresent form.\n\n## Current\nJudges[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Punjab_and_Haryana_High_Court&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Current Judges\")]\n\nDesignation | Name | Court No  \n---|---|---  \n[Chief Justice](/wiki/Chief_Justice \"Chief Justice\") | Krishna Murari | 1  \nJustice | Ajay Kumar Mittal | 2  \nJustice | Surya Kant | 3  \nJustice | T.P.S.
