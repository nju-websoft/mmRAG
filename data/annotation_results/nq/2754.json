For a few years, 1892–96, it played a major role as a left-wing\nforce in American politics. It was merged into the Democratic Party in 1896; a\nsmall independent remnant survived until 1908. It drew support from angry\nfarmers in the West and South and operated on the [left-wing](/wiki/Left-\nwing_politics \"Left-wing politics\") of American politics. It was highly\ncritical of capitalism, especially banks and railroads, and allied itself with\nthe [labor movement](/wiki/Labour_movement \"Labour movement\").[1][2][3]\n\nEstablished in 1891, as a result of the [Populist\nmovement](/wiki/Populist_movement_\\(United_States,_19th_Century\\) \"Populist\nmovement \\(United States, 19th Century\\)\"), the People's Party reached its\npeak in the [1892 presidential\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1892 \"United States\npresidential election, 1892\"), when its ticket, composed of [James B.\nWeaver](/wiki/James_B._Weaver \"James B.

Built on a coalition of poor, white cotton farmers in the\nSouth (especially [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North Carolina\"),\n[Alabama](/wiki/Alabama \"Alabama\") and [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\")) and hard-\npressed wheat farmers in the Plains states (especially [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas\n\"Kansas\") and [Nebraska](/wiki/Nebraska \"Nebraska\")), the Populists\nrepresented a radical crusading form of agrarianism and hostility to elites,\ncities, banks, railroads, and gold.\n\nThe party sometimes allied with [labor unions](/wiki/Trade_union \"Trade\nunion\") in the North and\n[Republicans](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party\n\\(United States\\)\") in the South. In the [1896 presidential\nelections](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1896 \"United States\npresidential election, 1896\") the Populists endorsed the Democratic\npresidential nominee, [William Jennings Bryan](/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan\n\"William Jennings Bryan\"), adding their own vice presidential nominee. By\njoining with the Democrats, the People's Party lost its independent identity\nand rapidly withered away.\n\nThe terms \"populism\" and \"populist\" have been used in the 20th and 21st\ncenturies to describe anti-elitist appeals against established interests or\nmainstream parties, referring to both the political\n[left](/wiki/Left_wing_populism \"Left wing populism\") and\n[right](/wiki/Right_wing_populism \"Right wing populism\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Formation\n  * 2 Presidential election of 1896\n  * 3 Populist-GOP fusion in North Carolina\n  * 4 Collapse\n  * 5 Debate by historians over populism\n  * 6 Elected officials\n    * 6.1 Governors\n    * 6.2 United States Congress\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 Further reading\n  * 10 External links\n    * 10.1 Contemporary accounts\n    * 10.2 Party publications and materials\n    * 10.3 Secondary sources\n\n##\nFormation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Formation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Peoples_Party_at_Columbus_Nebraska.jpg/400px-\nPeoples_Party_at_Columbus_Nebraska.jpg)](/wiki/File:Peoples_Party_at_Columbus_Nebraska.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Peoples_Party_at_Columbus_Nebraska.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPeople's Party candidate nominating convention held at [Columbus,\nNebraska](/wiki/Columbus,_Nebraska \"Columbus, Nebraska\"), July 15, 1890.\n\nA People's Party grew out of a large mood of agrarian unrest in response to\nlow agricultural prices in the South and the trans-gender West, as well as\nthought that the \"Eastern Elites\" were taking advantage of the farmers by\ncharging higher rates on loans and trains.[4] The [Farmers'\nAlliance](/wiki/Farmers%27_Alliance \"Farmers' Alliance\"), formed in [Lampasas,\nTexas](/wiki/Lampasas,_Texas \"Lampasas, Texas\"), in 1876, promoted collective\neconomic action by farmers and achieved widespread popularity in the\n[South](/wiki/U.S._South \"U.S. South\") and [Great Plains](/wiki/Great_Plains\n\"Great Plains\"). The Farmers' Alliance ultimately did not achieve its wider\neconomic goals of collective economic action against brokers, railroads, and\nmerchants, and many in the movement advocated for changes in national policy.\nBy the late 1880s, the Alliance had developed a political agenda that called\nfor regulation and reform in national politics, most notably an opposition to\nthe [gold standard](/wiki/Gold_standard \"Gold standard\") to counter the high\n[deflation](/wiki/Deflation \"Deflation\") in [agricultural](/wiki/Agricultural\n\"Agricultural\") prices in relation to other goods such as farm implements.\n\nIn 1886, an entirely different \"People's Party\" elected 6 assemblymen to the\n[Wisconsin State Assembly](/wiki/Wisconsin_State_Assembly \"Wisconsin State\nAssembly\") and 1 senator to the [Wisconsin State\nSenate](/wiki/Wisconsin_State_Senate \"Wisconsin State Senate\"). However this\nwas a [labor party](/wiki/Labor_Party_\\(United_States,_19th_century\\) \"Labor\nParty \\(United States, 19th century\\)\"), and by the 1888 elections it was\nusing the Union Labor Party label.\n\nIn December 1888 the National Agricultural Wheel and the Southern Farmer’s\nAlliance met at Meridian, Mississippi, where the national farmers convention\nwas held that year. In that meeting they decided to consolidate the two\nparties pending ratification. This consolidation gave the organization a new\nname, the Farmers and Laborers’ Union of America, and by 1889 the merger had\nbeen ratified, although there were conflicts between “conservative” Alliance\nmen and “political” Wheelers in Texas and Arkansas, which delayed the\nunification in these states until 1890 and 1891 respectively. The merger\neventually united white Southern Alliance and Wheel members, but it would not\ninclude African American members of agricultural organizations.[5]\n\nDuring their move towards consolidation in 1889, the leaders of both Southern\nFarmers’ Alliance and the Agricultural Wheel organizations contacted Terence\nV. Powderly, leader of the [Knights of Labor](/wiki/Knights_of_Labor \"Knights\nof Labor\"). “This contact between leaders of the farmers’ movement and\nPowderly helped pave the way for a series of reform conferences held between\nDecember 1889 and July 1892 that resulted in the formation of the national\nPeople’s (or Populist) Party.”[6]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/1892PopulistPoster.png/220px-1892PopulistPoster.png)](/wiki/File:1892PopulistPoster.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1892PopulistPoster.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n1892 People's Party campaign poster promoting James Weaver for President of\nthe United States.\n\nThe drive to create a new political party out of the movement arose from the\nbelief that the two major parties,\n[Democrats](/wiki/History_of_the_Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"History\nof the Democratic Party \\(United States\\)\") and\n[Republicans](/wiki/History_of_the_Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"History\nof the Republican Party \\(United States\\)\"), were controlled by bankers,\nlandowners and elites hostile to the needs of the small farmer. The movement\nreached its peak in 1892 when the party held a convention chaired by [Frances\nWillard](/wiki/Frances_Willard_\\(suffragist\\) \"Frances Willard\n\\(suffragist\\)\") (leader of the\n[WCTU](/wiki/Woman%27s_Christian_Temperance_Union \"Woman's Christian\nTemperance Union\") and a friend of Powderly's)[7] in [Omaha,\nNebraska](/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska \"Omaha, Nebraska\") and nominated candidates\nfor the national election.\n\nThe party's [platform](/wiki/Political_platform \"Political platform\"),\ncommonly known as the [Omaha Platform](/wiki/Omaha_Platform \"Omaha Platform\"),\ncalled for the abolition of national banks, a graduated [income\ntax](/wiki/Income_tax \"Income tax\"), [direct election of\nSenators](/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), civil service\nreform, a working day of eight hours and Government control of all\n[railroads](/wiki/Rail_transport \"Rail transport\"),\n[telegraphs](/wiki/Telegraph \"Telegraph\"), and [telephones](/wiki/Telephone\n\"Telephone\"). In the [1892 Presidential\nelection](/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1892 \"U.S. presidential election,\n1892\"), [James B. Weaver](/wiki/James_B._Weaver \"James B. Weaver\") received\n1,027,329 votes. Weaver carried four states ([Colorado](/wiki/Colorado\n\"Colorado\"), [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\"), [Idaho](/wiki/Idaho \"Idaho\"),\nand [Nevada](/wiki/Nevada \"Nevada\")) and received electoral votes from\n[Oregon](/wiki/Oregon \"Oregon\") and [North Dakota](/wiki/North_Dakota \"North\nDakota\") as well.\n\nThe party flourished most among farmers in the Southwest and [Great\nPlains](/wiki/Great_Plains \"Great Plains\"), as well as making significant\ngains in the [South](/wiki/U.S._South \"U.S. South\"), where they faced an\nuphill battle given the firmly entrenched [monopoly](/wiki/Monopoly\n\"Monopoly\") of the [Democratic Party](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Democratic Party \\(United States\\)\"). Success was often obtained through\n[electoral fusion](/wiki/Electoral_fusion \"Electoral fusion\"), with the\nDemocrats outside the South, but with alliances with the Republicans in\nSouthern states like Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.[8] For\nexample, in the elections of 1894, a coalition of Populists and Republicans\nled by Populist [Marion Butler](/wiki/Marion_Butler \"Marion Butler\") swept\nstate and local offices in North Carolina, and the coalition would go on to\nelect Republican [Daniel Lindsay Russell](/wiki/Daniel_Lindsay_Russell \"Daniel\nLindsay Russell\") as Governor in 1896.[9]\n\nQuite separate from the Populists were the Silverites in the western mining\nstates, who demanded [Free silver](/wiki/Free_Silver \"Free Silver\") to solve\nthe [Panic of 1893](/wiki/Panic_of_1893 \"Panic of 1893\"). By allowing the\ncoining of silver coins, they hoped to make the value of the money more than\nwhat it represented, which would lead to inflation of the currency, and thus,\nreduce the debt of the farmers to the Eastern Elites. This idea led former\nGreenback Party members to join the Populist Party.\n\nThe Populists followed the [Prohibition Party](/wiki/Prohibition_Party\n\"Prohibition Party\") in actively including women in their affairs. Some\nsouthern Populists, including [Thomas E. Watson](/wiki/Thomas_E._Watson\n\"Thomas E. Watson\") of Georgia, openly talked of the need for poor blacks and\npoor whites to set aside their racial differences in the name of shared\neconomic self-interest. Regardless of these rhetoric appeals, however, racism\ndid not evade the People's Party. Prominent Populist Party leaders such as\n[Marion Butler](/wiki/Marion_Butler \"Marion Butler\"), a United States Senator\nfrom [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North Carolina\"), at least\npartially demonstrated a dedication to the cause of [white\nsupremacy](/wiki/White_supremacy \"White supremacy\"), and there appears to have\nbeen some support for this viewpoint among the rank-and-file of the party's\nmembership.[10] After 1900 Watson himself became an outspoken white\nsupremacist and became the party's presidential nominee in 1904 and 1908,\nwinning 117,000 and 29,000 votes.\n\n## Presidential election of\n1896[[edit](/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Presidential election of 1896\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/William-Jennings-\nBryan-speaking-c1896.jpeg/200px-William-Jennings-Bryan-\nspeaking-c1896.jpeg)](/wiki/File:William-Jennings-Bryan-speaking-c1896.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:William-Jennings-Bryan-speaking-c1896.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIn 1896, the 36-year-old William Jennings Bryan was the chosen candidate\nresulting from the fusion of the Democrats and the People's Party.\n\nBy 1896, the Democratic Party took up many of the People's Party's causes at\nthe national level, and the party began to fade from national prominence. In\n[that year's presidential election](/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1896\n\"U.S. presidential election, 1896\"), the Democrats nominated [William Jennings\nBryan](/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan \"William Jennings Bryan\"), who focused on\nthe free silver issue as a solution to the economic depression and the\nmaldistribution of power. One of the great orators of the day, Bryan generated\nenormous excitement among Democrats with his \"[Cross of\nGold](/wiki/Cross_of_Gold_speech \"Cross of Gold speech\")\" speech, and appeared\nin the middle of 1896 to have a good chance of winning the election, if the\nPopulists voted for him.\n\nThe Populists had the choice of endorsing Bryan or running their own\ncandidate. After great infighting at their St. Louis convention they decided\nto endorse Bryan but with their own vice presidential nominee, [Thomas E.\nWatson](/wiki/Thomas_E._Watson \"Thomas E. Watson\") of Georgia. Watson was\ncautiously open to cooperation, but after the election would recant any hope\nhe had in the possibility of cooperation as a viable tool.[11] Bryan's\nstrength was based on the traditional Democratic vote (minus the middle class\nand German Catholics); he swept the old Populist strongholds in the west and\nSouth, and added the silverite states in the west, but did poorly in the\nindustrial heartland. He lost to Republican [William\nMcKinley](/wiki/William_McKinley \"William McKinley\") by a margin of 600,000\nvotes and lost again in a rematch in 1900 by a larger margin. Historians\nbelieve this was because of the tactics Bryan used, which had not been used\nbefore; he had aggressively \"run\" for president, while traditional candidates\nwould use \"front porch campaigns.\" [12]\n\n## Populist-GOP fusion in North\nCarolina[[edit](/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Populist-GOP fusion in North Carolina\")]\n\nIn 1894-96 the Populist wave of agrarian unrest swept through the cotton and\ntobacco regions of the South. The most dramatic impact came in North Carolina,\nwhere the poor white farmers who comprised the Populist party formed a working\ncoalition with the Republican Party, then largely controlled by blacks in the\nlow country, and poor whites in the mountain districts. They took control of\nthe state legislature in both 1894 and 1896, and the governorship in 1896.\nRestrictive rules on voting were repealed. In 1895 the Legislature rewarded\nits black allies with patronage, naming 300 black magistrates in eastern\ndistricts, as well as deputy sheriffs and city policemen. They also received\nsome federal patronage from the coalition congressman, and state patronage\nfrom the governor.[13]\n\n##\nCollapse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Collapse\")]\n\nThe Populist movement never recovered from the failure of 1896, and national\n[fusion](/wiki/Electoral_fusion \"Electoral fusion\") with the Democrats proved\ndisastrous to the party in the South. National alliance with the Democrats\nsapped the ability of the Populists to fight the Democrats locally in the\nSouth. Early on, this was less of an issue in the Western states where\nRepublicans were strong, as the Democratic-Populist alliance was a more\nnatural fit there, but eventually ended the party.\n\nIn North Carolina, the state Democratic-party orchestrated propaganda campaign\nin newspapers across the state, and created a brutal and violent white\nsupremacy election campaign to defeat the North Carolina Populists and GOP,\nthe Fusionist revolt in North Carolina collapsed in 1898, and white Democrats\nreturned to power. The gravity of the crisis was underscored by a [major race\nriot in Wilmington, in 1898](/wiki/Wilmington_Insurrection_of_1898 \"Wilmington\nInsurrection of 1898\"), two days after the election. Knowing they had just\nretaken control of the state legislature, the Democrats were confident they\ncould not be overcome. They attacked and overcame the Fusionists; mobs roamed\nthe black neighborhoods, shooting, killing, burning buildings, and making a\nspecial target of the black newspaper.[14] There were no further insurgencies\nin any Southern states involving a successful black coalition at the state\nlevel. </ref> By 1900, the gains of the populist-Republican coalition were\nreversed, and the Democrats ushered in disfranchisement[15]: practically all\nblacks lost their vote. The Populist/Republican alliance which had governed\n[North Carolina](/wiki/History_of_North_Carolina#Fusion_Politics \"History of\nNorth Carolina\"), the only state in which it had any success, fell apart.\n\nTennessee’s Populist Party was demoralized by a diminishing membership, and\npuzzled and split by the dilemma of whether to fight the state-level enemy\n(the Democrats) or the national foe (the Republicans and [Wall\nStreet](/wiki/Wall_Street \"Wall Street\")). By 1900 the People’s Party of\nTennessee was a shadow of what it once was.[16] A similar pattern was repeated\nelsewhere throughout the South, where the Populist Party had previously sought\nalliances with the Republican Party against the dominant state Democrats,\nincluding in Watson's Georgia.\n\nIn [1900](/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1900 \"U.S. presidential election,\n1900\"), while many Populist voters supported Bryan again, the weakened party\nnominated a separate ticket of [Wharton Barker](/wiki/Wharton_Barker \"Wharton\nBarker\") and [Ignatius L. Donnelly](/wiki/Ignatius_L._Donnelly \"Ignatius L.\nDonnelly\"), and disbanded afterwards. Populist activists either retired from\npolitics, joined a major party, or followed [Eugene Debs](/wiki/Eugene_Debs\n\"Eugene Debs\") into his new Socialist Party. In 1904, the party was re-\norganized, and [Thomas E. Watson](/wiki/Thomas_E._Watson \"Thomas E. Watson\")\nwas their nominee for president in\n[1904](/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1904 \"U.S. presidential election,\n1904\") and in [1908](/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1908 \"U.S. presidential\nelection, 1908\"), after which the party disbanded again.\n\nIn A Preface to Politics, published in 1913, Walter Lippmann wrote, \"As I\nwrite, a convention of the Populist Party has just taken place. Eight\ndelegates attended the meeting, which was held in a parlor.\"[17] This may\nrecord the last gasp of the party organization.\n\n## Debate by historians over\npopulism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Debate by historians over populism\")]\n\nSince the 1890s historians have vigorously debated the nature of Populism;\nmost scholars have been liberals who admired the Populists for their attacks\non banks and railroads. Some historians see a close link between the Populists\nof the 1890s and the progressives of 1900-1912, but most of the leading\nprogressives (except Bryan himself) fiercely opposed Populism. For example,\n[Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore Roosevelt\"), [George\nW. Norris](/wiki/George_W._Norris \"George W. Norris\"), [Robert La Follette\nSr.](/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette,_Sr. \"Robert M. La Follette, Sr.\"), [William\nAllen White](/wiki/William_Allen_White \"William Allen White\") and [Woodrow\nWilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson \"Woodrow Wilson\") all strongly opposed Populism.\nIt is debated whether any Populist ideas made their way into the Democratic\nparty during the New Deal era. The New Deal farm programs were designed by\nexperts (like [Henry Wallace](/wiki/Henry_A._Wallace \"Henry A. Wallace\")) who\nhad nothing to do with Populism.[18]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Populist_Party_campaign_poster_1904.jpg/250px-\nPopulist_Party_campaign_poster_1904.jpg)](/wiki/File:Populist_Party_campaign_poster_1904.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Populist_Party_campaign_poster_1904.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPeople's Party campaign poster from 1904 touting the candidacy of [Thomas E.\nWatson](/wiki/Thomas_E._Watson \"Thomas E. Watson\")\n\nSome historians see the populists as forward-looking liberal reformers. Others\nview them as reactionaries trying to recapture an idyllic and utopian past.\nFor some they were radicals out to restructure American life, and for others\nthey were economically hard-pressed agrarians seeking government relief. Much\nrecent scholarship emphasizes Populism's debt to early American\n[republicanism](/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States \"Republicanism in the\nUnited States\").[19] Clanton (1991) stresses that Populism was \"the last\nsignificant expression of an old radical tradition that derived from\nEnlightenment sources that had been filtered through a political tradition\nthat bore the distinct imprint of Jeffersonian, Jacksonian, and Lincolnian\ndemocracy.\" This tradition emphasized human rights over the cash nexus of the\nGilded Age's dominant ideology.[20]\n\n[Frederick Jackson Turner](/wiki/Frederick_Jackson_Turner \"Frederick Jackson\nTurner\") and a succession of western historians depicted the Populist as\nresponding to the closure of the frontier. Turner explained:\n\n    The Farmers' Alliance and the Populist demand for government ownership of the railroad is a phase of the same effort of the pioneer farmer, on his latest frontier. The proposals have taken increasing proportions in each region of Western Advance. Taken as a whole, Populism is a manifestation of the old pioneer ideals of the native American, with the added element of increasing readiness to utilize the national government to effect its ends.[21]\n\nThe most influential Turner student of Populism was John D. Hicks, who\nemphasized economic pragmatism over ideals, presenting Populism as interest\ngroup politics, with have-nots demanding their fair share of America's wealth\nwhich was being leeched off by nonproductive speculators. Hicks emphasized the\ndrought that ruined so many Kansas farmers, but also pointed to financial\nmanipulations, deflation in prices caused by the gold standard, high interest\nrates, mortgage foreclosures, and high railroad rates. Corruption accounted\nfor such outrages and Populists presented popular control of government as the\nsolution, a point that later students of republicanism emphasized.[22]\n\nIn the 1930s [C. Vann Woodward](/wiki/C._Vann_Woodward \"C. Vann Woodward\")\nstressed the southern base, seeing the possibility of a black-and-white\ncoalition of poor against the overbearing rich. Georgia politician Tom Watson\nserved as Woodward's hero.[23] In the 1950s, however, scholars such as\n[Richard Hofstadter](/wiki/Richard_Hofstadter \"Richard Hofstadter\") portrayed\nthe Populist movement as an irrational response of backward-looking farmers to\nthe challenges of modernity. He discounted third party links to Progressivism\nand argued that Populists were provincial, conspiracy-minded, and had a\ntendency toward scapegoatism that manifested itself as nativism, anti-\nSemitism, [anti-intellectualism](/wiki/Anti-intellectualism \"Anti-\nintellectualism\"), and Anglophobia. The antithesis of anti-modern Populism was\nmodernizing Progressivism according to Hofstadter's model, with such leading\nprogressives as [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore\nRoosevelt\"), Robert La Follette Sr., George Norris and [Woodrow\nWilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson \"Woodrow Wilson\") pointed as having been vehement\nenemies of Populism, though [William Jennings\nBryan](/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan \"William Jennings Bryan\") did cooperate\nwith them and accepted the Populist nomination in 1896.[24]\n\n[Michael Kazin](/wiki/Michael_Kazin \"Michael Kazin\")'s _The Populist\nPersuasion_ (1995) argued that Populism reflected a rhetorical style that\nmanifested itself in spokesmen like [Father Charles\nCoughlin](/wiki/Charles_Coughlin \"Charles Coughlin\") in the 1930s and Governor\n[George Wallace](/wiki/George_Wallace \"George Wallace\") in the 1960s.\n\nGoodwyn (1976)[25] and Postel (2007) reject the notion that the Populists were\ntraditionalistic and anti-modern. Quite the reverse, they argue, the Populists\naggressively sought self-consciously progressive goals. Goodwyn criticizes\nHofstadter’s reliance on secondary sources to characterize the Populists,\nworking instead with the material generated by the Populists themselves.\nGoodwyn determined that the farmers’ cooperatives gave rise to a Populist\nculture, and their efforts to free farmers from lien merchants revealed to\nthem the political structure of the economy, which propelled them into\npolitics. The Populists sought diffusion of scientific and technical\nknowledge, formed highly centralized organizations, launched large-scale\nincorporated businesses, and pressed for an array of state-centered reforms.\nHundreds of thousands of women committed to Populism seeking a more modern\nlife, education, and employment in schools and offices. A large section of the\nlabor movement looked to Populism for answers, forging a political coalition\nwith farmers that gave impetus to the regulatory state. Progress, however, was\nalso menacing and inhumane, Postel notes. White Populists embraced social-\nDarwinist notions of racial improvement, Chinese exclusion and separate-but-\nequal.[26]\n\nPopulists saw the [Panic of 1893](/wiki/Panic_of_1893 \"Panic of 1893\") as\nconfirmation that evil global conspiracies and big city villains were to\nblame. Historian [Hasia Diner](/wiki/Hasia_Diner \"Hasia Diner\") says:\n\n    Some Populists believed that Jews made up a class of international financiers whose policies had ruined small family farms, they asserted, owned the banks and promoted the gold standard, the chief sources of their impoverishment. Agrarian radicalism posited the city as antithetical to American values, asserting that Jews were the essence of urban corruption.[27]\n\n## Elected\nofficials[[edit](/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Elected officials\")]\n\n###\nGovernors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Governors\")]\n\n  * [Colorado](/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Colorado \"List of Governors of Colorado\"): [Davis Hanson Waite](/wiki/Davis_Hanson_Waite \"Davis Hanson Waite\"), 1893–1895\n  * [Idaho](/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Idaho \"List of Governors of Idaho\"): [Frank Steunenberg](/wiki/Frank_Steunenberg \"Frank Steunenberg\"), 1897–1901 ([Fusion](/wiki/Electoral_fusion \"Electoral fusion\") of Democrats and Populists)\n  * [Kansas](/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Kansas \"List of Governors of Kansas\"): [Lorenzo D.
