Later periods were defined by\ntrends in exterior styling, size, and utility preferences.\n\nIn 1808 [François Isaac de Rivaz](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Isaac_de_Rivaz \"François\nIsaac de Rivaz\") designed the first car powered by an [internal combustion\nengine](/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine \"Internal combustion engine\") fueled\nby [hydrogen](/wiki/Hydrogen \"Hydrogen\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn 1870 [Siegfried Marcus](/wiki/Siegfried_Marcus \"Siegfried Marcus\") built\nthe first gasoline powered combustion engine, which he placed on a pushcart,\nbuilding four progressively sophisticated combustion-engine cars over a\n10-to-15-year span that influenced later cars. Marcus created the two-cycle\ncombustion engine[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]. The car's second incarnation in 1880\nintroduced a four-cycle, gasoline-powered engine, an ingenious carburetor\ndesign and magneto ignition. He created an additional two models further\nrefining his design with steering, a clutch and brakes.\n\nThe [four-stroke](/wiki/Four-stroke_engine \"Four-stroke engine\")\n[petrol](/wiki/Petrol_engine \"Petrol engine\") (gasoline) [internal combustion\nengine](/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine \"Internal combustion engine\") that\nstill constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion was\npatented by [Nikolaus Otto](/wiki/Nikolaus_Otto \"Nikolaus Otto\"). The similar\nfour-stroke [diesel engine](/wiki/Diesel_engine \"Diesel engine\") was invented\nby [Rudolf Diesel](/wiki/Rudolf_Diesel \"Rudolf Diesel\"). The hydrogen [fuel\ncell](/wiki/Fuel_cell \"Fuel cell\"), one of the technologies hailed as a\nreplacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in\nprinciple by [Christian Friedrich\nSchönbein](/wiki/Christian_Friedrich_Sch%C3%B6nbein \"Christian Friedrich\nSchönbein\") in 1838. The battery [electric car](/wiki/Electric_car \"Electric\ncar\") owes its beginnings to [Ányos Jedlik](/wiki/%C3%81nyos_Jedlik \"Ányos\nJedlik\"), one of the inventors of the [electric motor](/wiki/Electric_motor\n\"Electric motor\"), and [Gaston Planté](/wiki/Gaston_Plant%C3%A9 \"Gaston\nPlanté\"), who invented the [lead-acid battery](/wiki/Lead-acid_battery \"Lead-\nacid battery\") in 1859.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn 1885, [Karl Benz](/wiki/Karl_Benz \"Karl Benz\") developed a petrol or\ngasoline powered automobile.[1] This is also considered to be the first\n\"production\" vehicle as Benz made several other identical copies. The\nautomobile was powered by a single[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\ncylinder two stroke engine.\n\nAfter producing and selling the [Model A](/wiki/Ford_Model_A_\\(1903\\) \"Ford\nModel A \\(1903\\)\") in 1903, [Ford Motor Company](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company\n\"Ford Motor Company\")'s [Model T](/wiki/Ford_Model_T \"Ford Model T\") became\nthe first mass-produced automobile in 1908, focusing on affordability for the\naverage consumer.

As\nCugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in\nhis native France. The center of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784,\n[William Murdoch](/wiki/William_Murdoch \"William Murdoch\") had built a working\nmodel of a steam carriage in [Redruth](/wiki/Redruth \"Redruth\") [4] and in\n1801 [Richard Trevithick](/wiki/Richard_Trevithick \"Richard Trevithick\") was\nrunning a full-sized vehicle on the roads in [Camborne](/wiki/Camborne\n\"Camborne\"). The first automobile patent in the United States was granted to\n[Oliver Evans](/wiki/Oliver_Evans \"Oliver Evans\") in 1789.\n\n#### 19th\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_automobile&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 19th century\")]\n\nDuring the 19th century attempts were made to introduce practical steam\npowered vehicles. Innovations such as hand [brakes](/wiki/Brake \"Brake\"),\nmulti-speed [transmissions](/wiki/Transmission_\\(mechanics\\) \"Transmission\n\\(mechanics\\)\") and better [steering](/wiki/Steering \"Steering\") developed.\nSome commercially successful vehicles provided [mass\ntransit](/wiki/Public_transport \"Public transport\") until a backlash against\nthese large vehicles resulted in the passage of legislation such as the United\nKingdom [Locomotive Act](/wiki/Locomotive_Act \"Locomotive Act\") (1865), which\nrequired many self-propelled vehicles on [public roads](/wiki/Highway\n\"Highway\") to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a\n[horn](/wiki/Horn_\\(acoustic\\) \"Horn \\(acoustic\\)\"). This effectively halted\nroad auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century;\ninventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway\n[locomotives](/wiki/Locomotive \"Locomotive\"). The law was not repealed until\n1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.\n\nIn 1816, a professor at [Prague\nPolytechnic](/wiki/Czech_Technical_University_in_Prague \"Czech Technical\nUniversity in Prague\"), [Josef Bozek](/wiki/Josef_Bozek \"Josef Bozek\"), built\nan oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 [Walter Hancock](/wiki/Walter_Hancock \"Walter\nHancock\"), builder and operator of London [steam buses](/wiki/Steam_bus \"Steam\nbus\"), in 1838 built a four-seat steam [phaeton](/wiki/Phaeton_\\(carriage\\)\n\"Phaeton \\(carriage\\)\").[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam\nbuggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec and again the following\nyear.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-\nwheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted\non the floor.[7]\n\nOne of the first \"real\" automobiles was produced by Frenchman [Amédée\nBollée](/wiki/Am%C3%A9d%C3%A9e_Boll%C3%A9e \"Amédée Bollée\") in 1873, who built\na self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads\nin the United States was a steam-powered vehicle invented in 1871 by Dr. J.W.\nCarhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine,\nWisconsin.[8] It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875 to offer a $10,000\naward to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and\nother animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an\naverage speed of more than 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) over a 200-mile (320\nkm) course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the\nUnited States, starting on 16 July 1878 in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in\nMadison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort Atkinson, and\nJanesville. While seven vehicles were registered, only two started to compete:\nthe entries from Green Bay and Oshkosh. The vehicle from Green Bay was faster,\nbut broke down before completing the race. The Oshkosh finished the 201-mile\n(323 km) course in 33 hours and 27 minutes, and posted an average speed of six\nmiles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[9][10][11]\n\n#### 20th\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_automobile&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 20th century\")]\n\nPre WWII\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/1924_Doble_Model_E_at_Henry_Ford_Museum.jpg/250px-1924_Doble_Model_E_at_Henry_Ford_Museum.jpg)](/wiki/File:1924_Doble_Model_E_at_Henry_Ford_Museum.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1924_Doble_Model_E_at_Henry_Ford_Museum.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n1924 Doble Model E\n\nSteam-powered road vehicles, both cars and wagons, reached the peak of their\ndevelopment in the early 1930s with fast-steaming lightweight boilers and\nefficient engine designs. Internal combustion engines also developed greatly\nduring WWI, becoming simpler to operate and more reliable. The development of\nthe high-speed diesel engine from 1930 began to replace them for wagons,\naccelerated in the UK by [tax\nchanges](/wiki/Steam_wagon#Why_road_steam_disappeared_in_the_UK \"Steam wagon\")\nmaking steam wagons uneconomic overnight. Although a few designers continued\nto advocate steam power, no significant developments in production steam cars\ntook place after [Doble](/wiki/Doble_steam_car \"Doble steam car\") in 1931.\n\nPost-WWII\n\nWhether steam cars will ever be reborn in later technological eras remains to\nbe seen.

Advances in [internal\ncombustion](/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine \"Internal combustion engine\")\ntechnology, especially the electric starter, soon rendered this advantage\nmoot; the greater range of gasoline cars, quicker refueling times, and growing\npetroleum infrastructure, along with the mass production of gasoline vehicles\nby companies such as the [Ford Motor Company](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company \"Ford\nMotor Company\"), which reduced prices of gasoline cars to less than half that\nof equivalent electric cars, led to a decline in the use of electric\npropulsion, effectively removing it from important markets such as the United\nStates by the 1930s. However, in recent years, increased concerns over the\n[environmental impact of gasoline cars](/wiki/Automobile#Environmental_impact\n\"Automobile\"), higher gasoline prices, improvements in battery technology, and\nthe prospect of [peak oil](/wiki/Peak_oil \"Peak oil\"), have brought about\nrenewed interest in electric cars, which are perceived to be more\nenvironmentally friendly and cheaper to maintain and run, despite high initial\ncosts, after a failed reappearance in the late-1990s.\n\n### Internal combustion\nengines[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_automobile&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Internal combustion engines\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Benz-1.jpg/220px-\nBenz-1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Benz-1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Benz-1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n1885-built [Benz Patent-Motorwagen](/wiki/Benz_Patent-Motorwagen \"Benz Patent-\nMotorwagen\"), the first car to go into production with an internal combustion\nengine\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/MW2_05_02_24_klein.jpg/220px-\nMW2_05_02_24_klein.jpg)](/wiki/File:MW2_05_02_24_klein.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MW2_05_02_24_klein.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe second Marcus car of 1888 at the Technical Museum in Vienna\n\nEarly attempts at making and using [internal combustion\nengines](/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine \"Internal combustion engine\") were\nhampered by the lack of suitable [fuels](/wiki/Fuel \"Fuel\"), particularly\nliquids, therefore the earliest engines used gas mixtures.\n\nEarly experimenters used gases. In 1806, Swiss engineer [François Isaac de\nRivaz](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Isaac_de_Rivaz \"François Isaac de Rivaz\") built [an\nengine](/wiki/De_Rivaz_engine \"De Rivaz engine\") powered by internal\ncombustion of a [hydrogen](/wiki/Hydrogen \"Hydrogen\") and\n[oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\") mixture.

A [Delamare-Deboutteville](/wiki/Delamare-\nDeboutteville \"Delamare-Deboutteville\") vehicle was patented and trialled in\n1884.\n\nAbout 1870, in [Vienna](/wiki/Vienna \"Vienna\"), Austria (then the [Austro-\nHungarian Empire](/wiki/Austria-Hungary \"Austria-Hungary\")), inventor\n[Siegfried Marcus](/wiki/Siegfried_Marcus \"Siegfried Marcus\") put a liquid-\nfuelled internal combustion engine on a simple handcart which made him the\nfirst man to propel a vehicle by means of gasoline. Today, this car is known\nas \"the first Marcus car\". In 1883, Marcus secured a German patent for a low-\nvoltage [ignition system](/wiki/Ignition_system \"Ignition system\") of the\n[magneto](/wiki/Ignition_magneto \"Ignition magneto\") type; this was his only\nautomotive patent. This design was used for all further engines, and the\nfour-[seat](/wiki/Car_seat \"Car seat\") \"second Marcus car\" of 1888/89. This\nignition, in conjunction with the \"rotating-brush\n[carburetor](/wiki/Carburetor \"Carburetor\")\", made the second car's design\nvery innovative. His second car is on display at the Technical Museum in\nVienna. During his lifetime he was honored as the originator of the motorcar\nbut his place in history was all but erased by the Nazis during World War II.\nBecause Marcus was of Jewish descent, the Nazi propaganda office ordered his\nwork to be destroyed, his name expunged from future textbooks, and his public\nmemorials removed, giving credit instead to Karl Benz.[17]\n\nIt is generally acknowledged[_[according to\nwhom?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] that the first really practical\nautomobiles with [petrol/gasoline-powered](/wiki/Petrol_engine \"Petrol\nengine\") internal combustion engines were completed almost simultaneously by\nseveral German inventors working independently: Karl Benz built his first\nautomobile in 1885 in [Mannheim](/wiki/Mannheim \"Mannheim\"). Benz was granted\na patent for his automobile on 29 January 1886,[18] and began the first\nproduction of automobiles in 1888, after [Bertha Benz](/wiki/Bertha_Benz\n\"Bertha Benz\"), his wife, had proved – with the first long-distance trip in\nAugust 1888, from Mannheim to Pforzheim and back – that the horseless coach\nwas absolutely suitable for daily use.

Dual- and even quad-engine cars\nwere designed, and [engine displacement](/wiki/Engine_displacement \"Engine\ndisplacement\") ranged to more than a dozen litres. Many modern advances,\nincluding [gas/electric hybrids](/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle \"Hybrid\nelectric vehicle\"), [multi-valve](/wiki/Multi-valve \"Multi-valve\") engines,\n[overhead camshafts](/wiki/Overhead_camshaft \"Overhead camshaft\"), and [four-\nwheel drive](/wiki/Four-wheel_drive \"Four-wheel drive\"), were attempted, and\ndiscarded at this time.\n\nIn 1898, [Louis Renault](/wiki/Louis_Renault_\\(industrialist\\) \"Louis Renault\n\\(industrialist\\)\") had a [De Dion-Bouton](/wiki/De_Dion-Bouton \"De Dion-\nBouton\") modified, with fixed [drive shaft](/wiki/Drive_shaft \"Drive shaft\")\nand [differential](/wiki/Differential_\\(mechanical_device\\) \"Differential\n\\(mechanical device\\)\"), making \"perhaps the first [hot rod](/wiki/Hot_rod\n\"Hot rod\") in history\" and bringing Renault and his brothers into the car\nindustry.[25] Innovation was rapid and rampant, with no clear\n[standards](/wiki/Technical_standard \"Technical standard\") for basic vehicle\narchitectures, [body styles](/wiki/Car_body_style \"Car body style\"),\nconstruction materials, or controls, for example many [veteran\ncars](/wiki/Veteran_car \"Veteran car\") use a [tiller](/wiki/Tiller \"Tiller\"),\nrather than a wheel for [steering](/wiki/Steering \"Steering\"). During 1903,\nRambler standardized on the steering wheel[26] and moved the driver's position\nto the left-hand side of the vehicle.[27] [Chain drive](/wiki/Chain_drive\n\"Chain drive\") was dominant over the drive shaft, and closed bodies were\nextremely rare. [Drum brakes](/wiki/Drum_brake \"Drum brake\") were introduced\nby Renault in 1902.[28] The next year, Dutch designer [Jacobus\nSpijker](/wiki/Spyker \"Spyker\") built the first [four-wheel drive](/wiki/Four-\nwheel_drive \"Four-wheel drive\") racing car;[29] it never competed and it would\nbe 1965 and the [Jensen FF](/wiki/Jensen_FF \"Jensen FF\") before four-wheel\ndrive was used on a production car.[30]\n\nInnovation was not limited to the vehicles themselves, either. Increasing\nnumbers of cars propelled the growth of the [petroleum\nindustry](/wiki/Petroleum_industry \"Petroleum industry\"),[31] as well as the\ndevelopment of technology to produce gasoline (replacing\n[kerosene](/wiki/Kerosene \"Kerosene\") and [coal oil](/wiki/Coal_oil \"Coal\noil\")) and of improvements in heat-tolerant [mineral oil](/wiki/Mineral_oil\n\"Mineral oil\") [lubricants](/wiki/Lubricant \"Lubricant\") (replacing\n[vegetable](/wiki/Vegetable_fats_and_oils \"Vegetable fats and oils\") and\n[animal](/wiki/Whale_oil \"Whale oil\") oils).[32]\n\nThere were social effects, also.

For example, [front-wheel drive](/wiki/Front-wheel_drive\n\"Front-wheel drive\") was re-introduced by André [Citroën](/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn\n\"Citroën\") with the launch of the [_Traction\nAvant_](/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn_Traction_Avant \"Citroën Traction Avant\") in 1934,\nthough it had appeared several years earlier in road cars made by\n[Alvis](/wiki/Alvis_Car_and_Engineering_Company_Ltd \"Alvis Car and Engineering\nCompany Ltd\") and [Cord](/wiki/Cord_Automobile \"Cord Automobile\"), and in\nracing cars by Miller (and may have appeared as early as 1897). In the same\nvein, independent suspension was originally conceived by [Amédée\nBollée](/wiki/Am%C3%A9d%C3%A9e_Boll%C3%A9e \"Amédée Bollée\") in 1873, but not\nput in production until appearing on the

were eliminated and fenders were incorporated into the body.\nAmong the first representatives of the style were the Soviet [GAZ-M20\nPobeda](/wiki/GAZ-M20_Pobeda \"GAZ-M20 Pobeda\") (1946), British [Standard\nVanguard](/wiki/Standard_Vanguard \"Standard Vanguard\") (1947), United States\n[Studebaker Champion](/wiki/Studebaker_Champion \"Studebaker Champion\")

Italian [Cisitalia 220](/wiki/Cisitalia\n\"Cisitalia\") sports car (1947).\n\nAutomobile design and production finally emerged from the military orientation\nand other shadow of war in 1949, the year that in the United States saw the\nintroduction of high-[compression](/wiki/Compression_ratio \"Compression\nratio\") [V8 engines](/wiki/V8_engine \"V8 engine\") and modern bodies from\n[General

placed the passenger compartment down inside the\nperimeter of the frame, that was one of the first new-design postwar cars made\nand featured trend-setting slab-side styling.[43] The

In Italy, [Enzo\nFerrari](/wiki/Enzo_Ferrari \"Enzo Ferrari\") was beginning his [250\nseries](/wiki/Ferrari_250 \"Ferrari 250\"), just as [Lancia](/wiki/Lancia\n\"Lancia\") introduced the revolutionary [V6](/wiki/V6_engine \"V6\nengine\")-powered [Aurelia](/wiki/Lancia_Aurelia \"Lancia Aurelia\").\n\nThroughout the 1950s, [engine](/wiki/Motive_power \"Motive power\")\n[power](/wiki/Power_\\(physics\\) \"Power \\(physics\\)\") and vehicle speeds rose,\ndesigns became more integrated and artful, and automobiles were marketed\ninternationally. [Alec Issigonis](/wiki/Alec_Issigonis \"Alec Issigonis\")'\n[Mini](/wiki/Mini \"Mini\") and [Fiat](/wiki/Fiat \"Fiat\")'s [500](/wiki/Fiat_500\n\"Fiat 500\") diminutive cars were introduced in Europe, while the similar [kei\ncar](/wiki/Kei_car \"Kei car\") class became popular in Japan. The [Volkswagen\nBeetle](/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle \"Volkswagen Beetle\") continued production\nafter [Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler \"Adolf Hitler\") and began exports to other\nnations, including the United States. At the same time, Nash introduced the\n[Nash Rambler](/wiki/Nash_Rambler \"Nash Rambler\"), the first successful modern\ncompact car made in the United States,[44] while the standard models produced\nby the \"Big Three\" domestic automakers grew ever larger in size, featuring\nincreasing amounts of chrome trim, and luxury was exemplified by the [Cadillac\nEldorado Brougham](/wiki/Cadillac_Eldorado \"Cadillac Eldorado\"). The markets\nin Europe expanded with new small-sized automobiles, as well as expensive\n[grand tourers](/wiki/Grand_tourer \"Grand tourer\") (GT), like the [Ferrari\nAmerica](/wiki/Ferrari_America \"Ferrari America\").\n\nThe market changed in the 1960s, as the United States \"Big Three\" automakers\nbegan facing competition from imported cars, the European makers adopted\nadvanced technologies and Japan emerged as a car-producing nation. Japanese\ncompanies began to export some of their more popular selling cars in Japan\ninternationally, such as the [Toyota Corolla](/wiki/Toyota_Corolla \"Toyota\nCorolla\"), [Toyota Corona](/wiki/Toyota_Corona \"Toyota Corona\"), [Nissan\nSunny](/wiki/Nissan_Sunny \"Nissan Sunny\"), and [Nissan\nBluebird](/wiki/Nissan_Bluebird \"Nissan Bluebird\") in the mid-1960s. The\nsuccess of [American Motors](/wiki/American_Motors \"American Motors\")'\ncompact-sized [Rambler](/wiki/Rambler_\\(automobile\\) \"Rambler \\(automobile\\)\")\nmodels spurred GM and Ford to introduce their own downsized cars in 1960.\nPerformance engines became a focus of marketing by United States automakers,\nexemplified by the era's [muscle cars](/wiki/Muscle_car \"Muscle car\"). In\n1964, the [Ford Mustang](/wiki/Ford_Mustang \"Ford Mustang\") developed a new\nmarket segment, the [pony car](/wiki/Pony_car \"Pony car\"). New models to\ncompete with the Mustang included the [Chevrolet\nCamaro](/wiki/Chevrolet_Camaro \"Chevrolet Camaro\"), [AMC\nJavelin](/wiki/AMC_Javelin \"AMC Javelin\"), and [Plymouth\nBarracuda](/wiki/Plymouth_Barracuda \"Plymouth Barracuda\"). [Captive\nimports](/wiki/Captive_import \"Captive import\") and [badge\nengineering](/wiki/Badge_engineering \"Badge engineering\") increased in the\nUnited States and the UK as [amalgamated](/wiki/Consolidation_\\(business\\)\n\"Consolidation \\(business\\)\") groups such as the [British Motor\nCorporation](/wiki/British_Motor_Corporation \"British Motor Corporation\")\nconsolidated the market. BMC's space-saving Mini, which first appeared in\n1959, was marketed under the [Austin](/wiki/Austin_Motor_Company \"Austin Motor\nCompany\") and [Morris](/wiki/Morris_Motors \"Morris Motors\") names, until Mini\nbecame a [marque](/wiki/Marque \"Marque\") in its own right in 1969.[45]\nCompetition increased, with [Studebaker](/wiki/Studebaker \"Studebaker\"), a\npioneering automaker, shutting down, and the trend for consolidation reached\nItaly where niche makers like [Maserati](/wiki/Maserati \"Maserati\"),\n[Ferrari](/wiki/Ferrari \"Ferrari\"), and [Lancia](/wiki/Lancia \"Lancia\") were\nacquired by larger companies. By the end of the decade, the number of\nautomobile marques had been greatly reduced.\n\nTechnology developments included the widespread use of [independent\nsuspensions](/wiki/Independent_suspension \"Independent suspension\"), wider\napplication of [fuel injection](/wiki/Fuel_injection \"Fuel injection\"), and an\nincreasing focus on [safety](/wiki/Automobile_safety \"Automobile safety\") in\n[automotive design](/wiki/Automotive_design \"Automotive design\"). Innovations\nduring the 1960s included [NSU](/wiki/NSU_Motorenwerke_AG \"NSU Motorenwerke\nAG\")'s [Wankel engine](/wiki/Wankel_engine \"Wankel engine\"), the [gas\nturbine](/wiki/Gas_turbine \"Gas turbine\"), and the\n[turbocharger](/wiki/Turbocharger \"Turbocharger\"). Of these, only the last\nendured, pioneered by [General Motors](/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation\n\"General Motors Corporation\"), and adopted by [BMW](/wiki/BMW \"BMW\") and\n[Saab](/wiki/Saab_Automobile \"Saab Automobile\"), later seeing mass-market use\nduring the 1980s by [Chrysler](/wiki/Chrysler \"Chrysler\"). [Mazda](/wiki/Mazda\n\"Mazda\") continued developing its [Wankel](/wiki/Mazda_Wankel_engine \"Mazda\nWankel engine\") engine, in spite of problems in longevity, emissions, and fuel\neconomy. Other Wankel licensees, including [Mercedes-Benz](/wiki/Mercedes-Benz\n\"Mercedes-Benz\") and GM, never put their designs into production because of\nengineering and manufacturing problems, as well as the lessons from the 1973\noil crisis.\n\nThe 1970s were turbulent years for automakers and buyers with major events\nreshaping the industry such as the [1973 oil crisis](/wiki/1973_oil_crisis\n\"1973 oil crisis\"), stricter [automobile emissions\ncontrol](/wiki/Automobile_emissions_control \"Automobile emissions control\")\nand safety requirements, increasing exports by the Japanese and European\nautomakers, as well as growth in inflation and the stagnant economic\nconditions in many nations.
