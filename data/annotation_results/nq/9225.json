The first Test hat-trick was recorded on 2 January 1879, in\nonly the third Test match to take place, by the\n[Australian](/wiki/Australian_cricket_team \"Australian cricket team\") pace\nbowler [Fred Spofforth](/wiki/Fred_Spofforth \"Fred Spofforth\"), nicknamed \"The\nDemon Bowler\", who dismissed three [English](/wiki/English_cricket_team\n\"English cricket team\") [batsmen](/wiki/Batsman \"Batsman\") with consecutive\ndeliveries at the [Melbourne Cricket Ground](/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground\n\"Melbourne Cricket Ground\"). The most recent bowler to achieve the feat was\n[English](/wiki/England_cricket_team \"England cricket team\") spin bowler\n[Moeen Ali](/wiki/Moeen_Ali \"Moeen Ali\") against South Africa on 31 July 2017.\nAt least one bowler from each of the ten nations that have played Test cricket\nhave taken a Test hat-trick.[3]\n\nA player has taken two hat-tricks in the same Test match only once. Playing\nfor Australia against [South Africa](/wiki/South_African_cricket_team \"South\nAfrican cricket team\") in the first match of the [1912 Triangular\nTournament](/wiki/1912_Triangular_Tournament \"1912 Triangular Tournament\") at\n[Old Trafford](/wiki/Old_Trafford_Cricket_Ground \"Old Trafford Cricket\nGround\"), [Manchester](/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\"), England, [leg\nspinner](/wiki/Leg_spin \"Leg spin\") [Jimmy Matthews](/wiki/Jimmy_Matthews\n\"Jimmy Matthews\") took a hat-trick in South Africa's first and second innings,\nboth taken on 28 May 1912. He completed both hat-tricks by dismissing South\nAfrica's [Tommy Ward](/wiki/Tommy_Ward_\\(cricketer\\) \"Tommy Ward\n\\(cricketer\\)\").[4] Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test\nhat-trick: Australian [off spinner](/wiki/Off_spin \"Off spin\") [Hugh\nTrumble](/wiki/Hugh_Trumble \"Hugh Trumble\") (two years apart, between the same\nteams at the same ground), [Pakistani](/wiki/Pakistani_cricket_team \"Pakistani\ncricket team\") fast bowler [Wasim Akram](/wiki/Wasim_Akram \"Wasim Akram\")\n(just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and\n[English](/wiki/English_cricket_team \"English cricket team\") fast bowler\n[Stuart Broad](/wiki/Stuart_Broad \"Stuart Broad\"). Three players have taken a\nhat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace bowler [Maurice\nAllom](/wiki/Maurice_Allom \"Maurice Allom\") in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner\n[Peter Petherick](/wiki/Peter_Petherick \"Peter Petherick\") in 1976, and\nAustralian pace bowler [Damien Fleming](/wiki/Damien_Fleming \"Damien Fleming\")\nin 1994.[3] [Geoff Griffin](/wiki/Geoff_Griffin \"Geoff Griffin\") took the\nfewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only\neight wickets in his entire Test career.[3] During the match in which he took\nhis hat-trick, Griffin was repeatedly [called for\nthrowing](/wiki/Throwing_\\(cricket\\) \"Throwing \\(cricket\\)\") by the umpires\nand never bowled again in a Test match.[5] Australian [Peter\nSiddle](/wiki/Peter_Siddle \"Peter Siddle\") is the only bowler to take a hat-\ntrick on his birthday,[6] and\n[Bangladeshi](/wiki/Bangladesh_national_cricket_team \"Bangladesh national\ncricket team\") off spinner [Sohag Gazi](/wiki/Sohag_Gazi \"Sohag Gazi\") is the\nonly player to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match.[7]\n\nAustralian [Merv Hughes](/wiki/Merv_Hughes \"Merv Hughes\") is the only bowler\nto take a hat-trick where the wickets fell over three overs. He took a wicket\nwith the final ball of an over. With the first ball of the next over he took\nthe final wicket of the West Indies innings. He then removed the opener\n[Gordon Greenidge](/wiki/Gordon_Greenidge \"Gordon Greenidge\") with the first\nball of the West Indies second innings.[8]\n\nIn the five-match series between a [Rest of the World\nXI](/wiki/Rest_of_the_World_cricket_team_in_England_in_1970 \"Rest of the World\ncricket team in England in 1970\") and England in 1970, a hat-trick was taken\nby South African [Eddie Barlow](/wiki/Eddie_Barlow \"Eddie Barlow\") in the\nfourth match, at [Headingley](/wiki/Headingley_Carnegie_Cricket_Ground\n\"Headingley Carnegie Cricket Ground\") (the last three of four wickets in five\nballs).[9] These matches were considered to be Tests at the time, but that\nstatus was later removed.[10]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Test hat-tricks\n  * 2 By team\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n    * 4.1 General\n    * 4.2 Specific\n\n## Test hat-tricks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Test_cricket_hat-\ntricks&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Test hat-tricks\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Fred_Spofforth.jpg/130px-\nFred_Spofforth.jpg)](/wiki/File:Fred_Spofforth.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Fred_Spofforth.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Australian](/wiki/Australian_cricket_team \"Australian cricket team\") bowler\n[Fred Spofforth](/wiki/Fred_Spofforth \"Fred Spofforth\") took the first [hat-\ntrick](/wiki/Hat-trick \"Hat-trick\") in [Test cricket](/wiki/Test_cricket \"Test\ncricket\") on 2 January 1879, in only the third Test match.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/18/WilliamBates1900.jpg/130px-\nWilliamBates1900.jpg)](/wiki/File:WilliamBates1900.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:WilliamBates1900.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Billy Bates](/wiki/Billy_Bates \"Billy Bates\") was the first player to take a\nhat-trick for England, four years after Spofforth achieved the feat.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Trum.jpg/130px-\nTrum.jpg)](/wiki/File:Trum.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Trum.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Hugh Trumble](/wiki/Hugh_Trumble \"Hugh Trumble\") is one of only four players\nto take more than one Test hat-trick, achieving the feat in 1902 and 1904.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Courtney_walsh.jpg/130px-\nCourtney_walsh.jpg)](/wiki/File:Courtney_walsh.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Courtney_walsh.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Courtney Walsh](/wiki/Courtney_Walsh \"Courtney Walsh\")'s hat-trick in 1988\nwas spread across two innings.
