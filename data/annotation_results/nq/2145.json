When the evil wizard [Lord Voldemort](/wiki/Lord_Voldemort\n\"Lord Voldemort\") kills Harry's parents before being reduced to a lesser form,\nDumbledore decides to place the now-orphaned Harry in the home of [Vernon and\nPetunia Dursley](/wiki/Dursley_family \"Dursley family\"). He knows that Harry\nwill be protected by the special magic caused by his mother's sacrifice, after\nhe evokes the magic of the bond of blood and Harry's aunt, his mother's sister\n- Petunia Evans Dursley, sealed it by accepting her nephew into her home. This\nold magic of binding love renders Voldemort incapable of touching Harry.\nDumbledore leaves Harry upon the doorstep of the Dursley home with a letter\nexplaining the situation. He departs with the final phrase, \"Good luck,\nHarry.\"\n\nWhen Harry arrives at Hogwarts, Dumbledore tells him about the secrets of the\n[Mirror of Erised](/wiki/Mirror_of_Erised \"Mirror of Erised\"), claiming that\nwhen he looks into it, he sees himself \"holding a pair of thick, woollen\nsocks.\" Harry later recalls in the final book that this was probably the only\ndishonest answer Dumbledore ever gave him. He is also responsible for somehow\nenchanting the Mirror so that it hides the [Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Sorcerer%27s_Stone \"Sorcerer's Stone\") and only someone who\nlooked into the Mirror and whose desire was \"to find the Stone ... but not use\nit\" would receive it, as anybody else would only see themselves using the\nStone due to the Mirror's special magic. He is called out to the [Ministry of\nMagic](/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic \"Ministry of Magic\") by a false message on the\nnight when Professor [Quirinus Quirrell](/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell \"Quirinus\nQuirrell\"), Harry Potter, [Ron Weasley](/wiki/Ron_Weasley \"Ron Weasley\"), and\n[Hermione Granger](/wiki/Hermione_Granger \"Hermione Granger\") enter the\ndungeons to retrieve the Stone, but realises during the trip that he is needed\nat Hogwarts and returns in time to rescue Harry from Quirrell and Voldemort.\nHe also has a final conversation with Harry after the events down in the\ndungeons and tells him that he is too young to comprehend the information\nabout why Voldemort attempts to kill him.\n\n### _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_\n\nIn the second novel, Dumbledore suspects that Tom Riddle is somehow involved\nin the attacks on the muggle born students, as he says, when asked who is the\nculprit, \"not who, but how?\" A younger Dumbledore appears in Riddle's diary,\nwhen Harry sees his memory, and asks Riddle if he knows anything about the\nattacks on the students. During the last half of the novel, [Lucius\nMalfoy](/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy \"Lucius Malfoy\") forces the school's other eleven\ngovernors to suspend Dumbledore as Headmaster in the wake of attacks by a\n[basilisk](/wiki/Basilisk_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Basilisk \\(Harry Potter\\)\") in the\nschool when the [Chamber of\nSecrets](/wiki/Locations_in_Hogwarts#Chamber_of_Secrets \"Locations in\nHogwarts\") is opened. Dumbledore is reinstated when the governors discover\nthat [Ginny Weasley](/wiki/Ginny_Weasley \"Ginny Weasley\") was taken into the\nChamber of Secrets and Lucius is found to have coerced the other governors\ninto suspending him.\n\n### _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_\n\nAt the beginning of the third novel, Dumbledore is forced to accept\n[Dementors](/wiki/Magical_creatures_\\(Harry_Potter\\)#Dementors \"Magical\ncreatures \\(Harry Potter\\)\") onto his school's grounds for the protection of\nhis students from [Sirius Black](/wiki/Sirius_Black \"Sirius Black\"), the\nsupposed murderer and accessory to murder, who had escaped from\n[Azkaban](/wiki/Azkaban \"Azkaban\"). After Black's breach into Hogwarts,\nDumbledore issues orders to close every entrance to the school and grounds.\nAfter Harry falls off his broomstick during a [Quidditch](/wiki/Quidditch\n\"Quidditch\") match because of the Dementors, Dumbledore becomes\nuncharacteristically angry with them and uses his wand to cause Harry to\nlevitate safely to the ground. Later in that book, Dumbledore suggests\nHermione Granger use her Ministry-approved [Time-Turner](/wiki/Time-Turner\n\"Time-Turner\") to go back three hours to save [Buckbeak](/wiki/Buckbeak\n\"Buckbeak\") the [hippogriff](/wiki/Hippogriff \"Hippogriff\") and Sirius from\ntheir unjust executions.\n\n### _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_\n\nIn the fourth novel, Dumbledore introduces the [Triwizard\nTournament](/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament \"Triwizard Tournament\"). He also serves\nas a judge during the entire event. When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet\nof Fire, Dumbledore is not enraged, but remains calm; simply asking Harry\nwhether he had himself, or had asked an older student to submit his name\n(although in the [film\nversion](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_\\(film\\) \"Harry Potter and\nthe Goblet of Fire \\(film\\)\") he does get angry to the point of manhandling\nHarry). When Harry answers no, he believes him. By the end of the book,\nDumbledore's fears are realised when Harry returns from his encounter with\nVoldemort clutching the dead body of [Cedric Diggory](/wiki/Cedric_Diggory\n\"Cedric Diggory\") and when [Mad-Eye Moody](/wiki/Mad-Eye_Moody \"Mad-Eye\nMoody\") (being impersonated by [Barty Crouch Jr](/wiki/Barty_Crouch_Jr \"Barty\nCrouch Jr\"), through Polyjuice Potion) takes Harry away from Dumbledore and to\nhis office inside the castle. Dumbledore immediately becomes suspicious and\nheads straight towards Moody's office with [Minerva\nMcGonagall](/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall \"Minerva McGonagall\") and [Severus\nSnape](/wiki/Severus_Snape \"Severus Snape\") to save Harry and to interrogate\nCrouch. Afterwards, Dumbledore listens to Harry's eyewitness account about\nVoldemort's return. Harry though, only wakes up later to find Minister for\nMagic [Cornelius Fudge](/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge \"Cornelius Fudge\") in the\nhospital wing arguing with McGonagall and Dumbledore. In the end, Fudge and\nDumbledore \"part ways\" after an argument about the situation of Voldemort's\nreturn and the consequences that would follow should Fudge remain in denial of\nthis fact.\n\n### _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_\n\nIn the fifth book, Dumbledore is demoted from Chief Warlock of the\n[Wizengamot](/wiki/Wizengamot \"Wizengamot\"), voted out of the Chairmanship of\nthe International Confederation of Wizards, and is almost stripped of his\nOrder of Merlin First Class due to his speeches regarding the return of\nVoldemort, although it is reported that he is unconcerned as long as he is not\ntaken off the Chocolate Frog cards. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic does\neverything they can to discredit him and Harry – mainly through the _[Daily\nProphet](/wiki/Daily_Prophet \"Daily Prophet\")_. At the beginning of the book,\nDumbledore enrages Fudge when he stops by at Harry's\n[hearing](/wiki/Hearing_\\(law\\) \"Hearing \\(law\\)\") with a witness ([Arabella\nFigg](/wiki/Arabella_Figg \"Arabella Figg\")) to ensure that he is not expelled.\nWhile Harry feels better when Dumbledore assists him, he becomes annoyed to\nthe point of being angry that the headmaster refuses to speak to or even look\nat him.\n\nDuring the following year at Hogwarts, the Ministry passes Educational Decree\nTwenty-two, allowing Fudge to place [Dolores Umbridge](/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge\n\"Dolores Umbridge\") to the post of [Defence Against the Dark\nArts](/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts \"Defence Against the Dark Arts\")\nteacher (after Dumbledore failed to find a suitable candidate). Through her,\nFudge gradually gains power over Hogwarts and Dumbledore, who he fears is\nbuilding an under-age wizard army to overthrow the Ministry. Umbridge forbids\npractical defence practice in her classes, forcing Harry, Ron, and Hermione to\nform [Dumbledore's Army](/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army \"Dumbledore's Army\") (a\ndefence group led by Harry) with fellow friends. It is when the Ministry\ndiscovers the D.A. that Dumbledore, choosing to accept the responsibility,\nfalsely claims that the organisation was his own subversive creation, and\nallows himself to be removed as headmaster (for the second time) rather than\nallow Harry to be expelled.\n\nDumbledore is not heard of again in the book until he arrives in the\n[Department of Mysteries](/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries \"Department of\nMysteries\") to aid the Order in the battle against the Death Eaters. He\nsubdues all the Death Eaters, except for [Bellatrix\nLestrange](/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange \"Bellatrix Lestrange\"), and binds them\nwith an Anti-Disapparition Jinx to prevent them from magically escaping. He\nthen saves Harry from the _[Avada Kedavra](/wiki/Avada_Kedavra \"Avada\nKedavra\")_ curse conjured by Voldemort and engages in a ferocious duel with\nthe Dark Lord. This culminates in Voldemort's attempting to possess Harry in\nan attempt to make Dumbledore kill the boy. Voldemort is forced to leave\nHarry's body and flee with Bellatrix after this ruse fails. Many ministry\nofficials having witnessed the end of the battle, Dumbledore is reinstated as\nheadmaster and retrieves all his distinctions. Towards the end of the book,\nDumbledore explains to Harry that Voldemort chose him as his equal and that\none must kill the other in the end, and confesses that his great affection for\nHarry has clouded his judgement.\n\n### _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_\n\nIn the sixth book, Dumbledore fetches Harry from Privet Drive and takes him to\npersuade [Horace Slughorn](/wiki/Horace_Slughorn \"Horace Slughorn\") to rejoin\nthe Hogwarts staff. Harry notices that Dumbledore's right hand is shrivelled\nand black. During the school year, Dumbledore teaches Harry of events in\nVoldemort's past that he feels are of immense importance. Using the Pensieve,\nthey visit the memories of others, which contain important information about\nVoldemort's life and his [genocidal](/wiki/Genocide \"Genocide\") rise to power.\nWhile using the [pensieve](/wiki/Pensieve \"Pensieve\"), Harry sees a vision of\nDumbledore's first encounter with Voldemort, then a disturbed young orphan\nnamed Tom Riddle; Dumbledore had known from the beginning that the boy was\ndangerous, but believed that Hogwarts would change him.\n\nIt is learned that Voldemort created six [Horcruxes](/wiki/Horcrux \"Horcrux\")\nto gain [immortality](/wiki/Immortality \"Immortality\") and that they must all\nbe destroyed before Harry goes after the final piece of Voldemort's soul in\nthe Dark Lord's body. Harry also repeatedly warns Dumbledore in most of their\nlessons that [Draco Malfoy](/wiki/Draco_Malfoy \"Draco Malfoy\") is working for\nVoldemort. Dumbledore refuses to take any action against Draco, and instead\ntells Harry that he already knows more about what is happening than Harry\ndoes.\n\nBy the end of the book, Dumbledore and Harry set out to the cave where\nDumbledore believes a Horcrux resides. In the cave, Dumbledore drinks a potion\ninside the Horcrux's container; while drinking it, he begins to scream,\nseemingly enduring mental torture and being weakened. Dumbledore begins to\ncall out for water after he finishes the potion, and Harry, realising he has\nno other choice, dips the goblet into the lake to give him a drink. When he\ndoes this though, all the [Inferi](/wiki/Inferius \"Inferius\") that reside in\nthe lake grab at Harry and attempt to drag him down and drown him in the lake.\nDumbledore suddenly recovers, thanks to the water, and conjures a [fire\nlasso](/w/index.php?title=Spells_in_Harry_Potter&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Spells\nin Harry Potter \\(page does not exist\\)\") around them. Dumbledore takes the\nhorcrux (a locket) and both make their way back out of the cave and back to\nHogsmeade. When they return, [Madam Rosmerta](/wiki/Madam_Rosmerta \"Madam\nRosmerta\") informs them that the [Dark Mark](/wiki/Dark_Mark \"Dark Mark\") was\nconjured over the [Astronomy Tower](/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Astronomy\n\"Magic in Harry Potter\"). In the tower, Dumbledore enjoins Harry not to\ninterfere in the events that are about to take place there, and places him in\na body-binding curse under his invisibility cloak. Hidden, Harry is unable to\nintervene as Dumbledore (now extremely weak) is disarmed by Draco. Dumbledore\nis conversing with Draco about the plot to kill him, when several other Death\nEaters enter the tower and try to persuade Draco to kill Dumbledore. When\nDraco hesitates, Snape appears and performs the Killing Curse on Dumbledore,\nonly after Dumbledore pleads with Snape saying, \"Severus, please ...\". To what\nDumbledore was referring is not revealed until the seventh book. Dumbledore\ndies in Hogwarts' grounds.\n\nShortly after his death, Dumbledore's portrait magically appears in the\nHeadmaster's office. His funeral is attended by students, Hogwarts staff,\nmembers of the Ministry of Magic, [ghosts](/wiki/Ghosts_\\(Harry_Potter\\)\n\"Ghosts \\(Harry Potter\\)\"),\n[centaurs](/wiki/Magical_creatures_\\(Harry_Potter\\)#Centaurs \"Magical\ncreatures \\(Harry Potter\\)\"), [merpeople](/wiki/Mermaid \"Mermaid\") and others\nwho wish to pay their respects. Shrouded in purple velvet, he is entombed in a\nwhite marble sarcophagus beside the lake at Hogwarts, and it is said that he\nis the only headmaster to be buried on the school grounds.\n\n### _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_\n\nRowling used several chapters in _[Harry Potter and the Deathly\nHallows](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows\")_ to reveal two main matters concerning Dumbledore: his early\nlife and his death. The book introduces his parents, Percival and Kendra\nDumbledore, as well as his little sister, Ariana; his brother, [Aberforth\nDumbledore](/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore \"Aberforth Dumbledore\"), was mentioned\nin previous books. At six years old, Ariana was attacked by three Muggle boys\nwho had witnessed her doing magic. Because of this attack, Ariana was\nseriously traumatised and never able to control her magic again, having\nrecurring outbursts of magic. Enraged, Percival mercilessly attacked the\nMuggle boys (killing them in the [film\nversion](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_1 \"Harry\nPotter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\")), and was sentenced to life in\nAzkaban. After this, Kendra moved her family to the village of [Godric's\nHollow](/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow \"Godric's Hollow\"). In one of her outbursts,\nAriana accidentally kills Kendra around the time Albus has completed his\neducation. Albus becomes the head of the family and is forced to remain in his\nhouse with his sister Ariana while Aberforth completes his education.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/The_Elder_WandII.jpg/330px-\nThe_Elder_WandII.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Elder_WandII.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Elder_WandII.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Elder Wand](/wiki/Elder_Wand \"Elder Wand\"), as reproduced in _Harry\nPotter_ [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") films\n\nSoon afterward, a young [Gellert Grindelwald](/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald\n\"Gellert Grindelwald\") arrived in Godric's Hollow to live with his great-aunt,\n[Bathilda Bagshot](/wiki/Bathilda_Bagshot \"Bathilda Bagshot\"), author of _A\nHistory of Magic_. The two young men took to each other immediately, and\ntogether they dreamed of a world ruled by wizards over Muggles by uniting the\nlegendary [Deathly Hallows](/wiki/Deathly_Hallows_\\(objects\\) \"Deathly Hallows\n\\(objects\\)\"). They believed that if they were forced to destroy a few along\nthe way, it would still be \"for the greater good\", and the sufferings and\nlosses would be rewarded a hundredfold in the end. This scenario would never\nhappen, though. A discussion between Albus, Aberforth, and Grindelwald led to\na duel that resulted in Ariana's death. For the rest of his life, Albus felt\nguilty, never certain whether it was his own curse or another's that had\nkilled his sister. Grindelwald stormed back to Bagshot's home and departed to\nbegin his own rule, leaving the country hours later. As a result of his\nmistakes, Albus felt that he was not to be trusted with power and, because of\nthis, never took the position of Minister for Magic, despite being offered it\nseveral times. Dumbledore returned to Hogwarts as professor of\nTransfiguration, and he served in recruiting students for the school.\n\nDecades later, in 1945,[18] Dumbledore finally defeated the\nnow-[Dark](/wiki/Dark_Arts_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Dark Arts \\(Harry Potter\\)\")\nwizard Grindelwald, who had come to possess the [Elder\nWand](/wiki/Deathly_Hallows_\\(objects\\)#Elder_Wand \"Deathly Hallows\n\\(objects\\)\"). Grindelwald's defeat made Dumbledore the master of the Elder\nWand, which remained his until just before his death, when Draco used the\nDisarming Charm on him.\n\nDumbledore had another Hallow in his keeping since the death of James Potter:\nthe [Invisibility\nCloak](/wiki/Deathly_Hallows_\\(object\\)#Cloak_of_Invisibility \"Deathly Hallows\n\\(object\\)\"), which he had borrowed to examine. When James died, Dumbledore\nkept the cloak and decided to pass it on to Harry, James's son.\n\nThe truth about Dumbledore's death is revealed through Snape's last memories\nin the [Pensieve](/wiki/Pensieve \"Pensieve\"). Harry learns that Dumbledore\nmade a terrible error by placing a cursed ring on his right hand, sometime\nbetween the fifth and sixth book, forgetting the curses that must be on the\nring. The ring held the [Resurrection\nStone](/wiki/Deathly_Hallows_\\(objects\\)#Resurrection_Stone \"Deathly Hallows\n\\(objects\\)\"), which Dumbledore hoped to use to allow him to apologise to his\nsister and parents. Dumbledore called Snape to help him; however, when Snape\narrived and assessed the curse, all he could do was contain it. Snape told\nDumbledore that he had little more than a year to live. After hearing this\nnews, Dumbledore revealed to Snape that he knew about Voldemort's plan to have\nDraco kill him. He asked Snape to use the Killing Curse on him when the time\ncame because he did not want Draco to have to kill him, saying that the boy's\nsoul was still intact; Draco's soul would have been damaged in killing\nDumbledore out of malice, whereas Snape was fully aware that he would be\nmerely sparing Dumbledore pain and humiliation. He also intended for Snape to\nbe the one to kill him and for the Elder Wand to be buried with him, in order\nto prevent the wand from being passed on again.\n\nDumbledore's spirit appears to Harry towards the end of the book in a limbo-\nlike [King's Cross](/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station \"London King's\nCross railway station\"), after Harry is struck with the Killing Curse which\nwas conjured by Voldemort. During the last book, Harry finds out that he must\ndie because he is a Horcrux. When Voldemort conjures the Killing Curse, Harry\ndoes not fight back, which stops him from dying. When they meet again, the boy\ncomforts Dumbledore as he confesses all of his many regrets. Dumbledore then\ninforms Harry of the choice he still has: of moving on to the next life or\nreturning to his body to face Voldemort one last time. After returning from\nthe mystical King's Cross and defeating Voldemort for good, Harry has a short\nconversation with Dumbledore's portrait in the Headmaster's office about the\nfate of each of the three Deathly Hallows. He keeps the Cloak, leaves the\nStone in the Forbidden Forest where he dropped it, and returns the Elder Wand\nto Dumbledore's tomb (from which Voldemort had stolen it).

Harris mentioned that he was\noriginally not going to take the role, since he knew his own health was in\ndecline. He accepted because his then-11-year-old granddaughter threatened\nnever to speak to him again if he did not take it.[19] Harris was determined\nto portray Dumbledore again in _[Prisoner of\nAzkaban](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_\\(film\\) \"Harry Potter\nand the Prisoner of Azkaban \\(film\\)\")_ (2004), despite having been diagnosed\nwith [Hodgkin's lymphoma](/wiki/Hodgkin%27s_lymphoma \"Hodgkin's lymphoma\"),\nand asked [David Heyman](/wiki/David_Heyman \"David Heyman\") not to recast the\nrole.[20] However, his death on 25 October 2002 necessitated recasting.[21]\n\n[Ian McKellen](/wiki/Ian_McKellen \"Ian McKellen\") was offered the role, but he\nturned it down, having played the similar character [Gandalf](/wiki/Gandalf\n\"Gandalf\") in [_The Lord of the Rings_\ntrilogy](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_\\(film_series\\) \"The Lord of the Rings\n\\(film series\\)\"), as well as feeling it would have been inappropriate to take\nHarris's role, as Harris had called McKellen a \"dreadful\" actor.[22] Harris's\nfamily had expressed an interest in seeing [Peter\nO'Toole](/wiki/Peter_O%27Toole \"Peter O'Toole\") being chosen as his\nreplacement.[23]\n\n[Michael Gambon](/wiki/Michael_Gambon \"Michael Gambon\") was cast as Harris's\nreplacement four months after Harris's death.[24] Gambon was not concerned\nabout bettering Harris, and he portrayed the character in his own way, putting\non a slight Irish accent for the role,[25] as well as completing his scenes in\nthree weeks.[26] Gambon reprised his role in all the remaining films.\n\n[Toby Regbo](/wiki/Toby_Regbo \"Toby Regbo\") was chosen to portray Dumbledore\nin his youth in _[Deathly Hallows Part\n1](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_-_Part_1 \"Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows - Part 1\")_ and _[Part\n2](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_-_Part_2 \"Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows - Part 2\")_ , for flashbacks scenes which provide essential\ninformation on the character's backstory.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[Jude Law](/wiki/Jude_Law \"Jude Law\") will be playing the role of a younger\nDumbledore in the second prequel film, _[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of\nGrindelwald](/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts:_The_Crimes_of_Grindelwald \"Fantastic\nBeasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\")_.[27][28]\n\n## Characterisation\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. _(March 2018)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this template message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal \"Help:Maintenance template removal\"))_  \n---|---  \n  \n### Appearance\n\nAlbus Dumbledore was tall and thin, with silver hair and beard (auburn in his\nyouth) so long that they could be tucked into his belt. He had a very long and\ncrooked nose that looked as if it had been broken at least twice. (It is\nspeculated that his brother's punch during their sister's funeral may have\nplayed a role in shaping his nose.) He was also said to have had long and\nskillful fingers. His eyes were described to be a brilliant, soul-piercing\nshade of blue, and usually twinkled with kindness and mischief.\n\nDumbledore wore half-moon spectacles and a colourful array of robes, ranging\nfrom purple to bright orange. He once claimed to have a scar above his left\nknee in the precise shape of a map of the London Underground, but whether or\nnot he actually does is unknown. His demeanour is often – if not always –\nserene and ethereal, and he usually spoke in a calm, pleasant voice even when\nHarry thought that he was actually furious.\n\nDuring the last year of his life, Dumbledore's right hand was scarred when he\ndonned Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, which was cursed. Had Snape not intervened with a\ncounter-curse, Dumbledore would have died much more quickly. Regardless, the\ncurse left his hand blackened and dead-looking, and no amount of healing could\nrepair the appearance. According to Snape, the curse would eventually spread\nitself from the contained hand, and Dumbledore was doomed to die in no more\nthan one year's time. Whether this means the blackening dead-look appearance\nwould spread throughout the entire body is unknown.\n\n### Personality\n\nConsidered the most powerful wizard in the world, Dumbledore is benevolent and\nwise, a good wizard in the style of Merlin.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] He\nalmost constantly gives off an aura of serenity and composure, rarely\ndisplaying intense emotions of anger or fear. Yet despite his benign nature,\nit is said that Dumbledore was the only wizard Lord Voldemort ever truly\nfeared. Dumbledore is very [eccentric](/wiki/Eccentricity_\\(behavior\\)\n\"Eccentricity \\(behavior\\)\") and even slightly effeminate; he is very fond of\nknitting patterns and frequently wears flamboyant clothing (at one point, he\nis seen wearing a flowered bonnet). He is also known for his odd displays of\nwhimsicality; he often uses humour to make people feel comfortable in his\npresence. As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore displays numerous\nexamples of extraordinary powers. His abilities as a wizard are combined with\na kind of cunning and subtlety of mind that allowed him to comprehend human\nnature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, love, and friendship)\nto Voldemort's disadvantage in particular.\n\nMore than anything else, Dumbledore has a deep capacity for love, frequently\nreminding Harry that love was the greatest magic of all. Dumbledore believes\nin the good in everyone and insists on giving second chances. The greatest\nexample of this is Dumbledore's relationship with Snape, in whom Dumbledore is\nwilling to place a considerable amount of faith because he showed remorse.\nDumbledore is highly perceptive and emotionally intelligent; his knowledge of\na person's true personality goes beyond simply being a good judge of\ncharacter. This is never more apparent than in his complex insights into\nVoldemort's psyche, which he pieces together with Harry to deduce where\nVoldemort's horcruxes are hidden.\n\nHowever, in spite of Dumbledore's many extraordinary qualities, he was no\nsaint. According to Rowling, \"Although Dumbledore seems to be so benign for\nsix books, he's quite a [Machiavellian](/wiki/Machiavellian \"Machiavellian\")\nfigure, really. He's been pulling a lot of strings.\"[29] In a 2005 interview,\nRowling commented: \"Immense brainpower does not protect you from emotional\nmistakes, and I think Dumbledore really exemplifies that.\"[30] Dumbledore's\ngreatest personality flaw, which he explained to Harry, was his desire for\npower. He eventually found that those best suited for power are those who do\nnot seek it. When he and Grindelwald met each other, they made plans to\nenslave Muggles and re-establish wizards as the natural rulers of the world.\nHowever, Dumbledore was disillusioned of this fantasy after his sister Ariana\nwas killed during a duel between himself, his brother Aberforth, and\nGrindelwald.\n\nDumbledore was haunted by his sad family history. In particular, he was\nriddled with guilt over the circumstances surrounding the death of his sister.\nHe felt enormous remorse for his selfishness and was tortured for the rest of\nhis life by the possibility that he might have been the one who cast the spell\nthat killed his sister. When he looked into the Mirror of Erised, he saw\nhimself redeemed in the eyes of his brother and his entire family alive and\ntogether.\n\n### Magical abilities and skills\n\nSince a young age, Dumbledore has always shown great magical abilities. During\nhis education at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was known as the most brilliant student\nto have ever stepped into the school, winning \"every prize of note that the\nschool offered\", and in his N.E.W.T.s, \"... did things with a wand [the\nexaminer had] never seen before\". Rowling has said that Dumbledore is\nprimarily self-taught, although he \"had access to superb teachers at\nHogwarts,\" and, as far as his education is concerned, \"Dumbledore's family\nwould be a profitable line of inquiry.\"[31] While he is not vain, Dumbledore\nalso exhibits no false modesty, readily acknowledging that he is unusually\nintelligent and an exceptionally powerful wizard. He admits a number of times\nto Harry in their occasional meetings in _Half-Blood Prince_ that he makes\nmistakes, and since he is smarter than most men, his mistakes \"tend to be\ncorrespondingly huger.\"\n\nDumbledore is an expert at nonverbal spells and is famous as an\n[alchemist](/wiki/Alchemy \"Alchemy\") who has worked with [Nicolas\nFlamel](/wiki/Nicolas_Flamel#In_popular_culture \"Nicolas Flamel\"), the only\nknown maker of [the Philosopher's Stone](/wiki/Sorcerer%27s_Stone \"Sorcerer's\nStone\"), and is credited with discovering the twelve uses of\n[dragon](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\")'s blood. His [Patronus](/wiki/Patronus_Charm\n\"Patronus Charm\") takes the form of a [phoenix](/wiki/Phoenix_\\(mythology\\)\n\"Phoenix \\(mythology\\)\"),[32] a recurring symbol in the books.\n\nHis knowledge of the most powerful kind of magic, love, is extensive. He\ntaught Harry about its very essence, and the innate power of his ability to\nlove his parents, which eventually helped Harry realise his destiny to kill\nLord Voldemort.\n\nHe is known to be able to conjure [Gubraithian fire](/wiki/Gubraithian_fire\n\"Gubraithian fire\") (magical everlasting fire). He has claimed to be able to\nbecome invisible without using an [invisibility\ncloak](/wiki/Invisibility_cloak_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Invisibility cloak \\(Harry\nPotter\\)\"), which is a powerful Disillusionment Charm. Dumbledore is also\nskilled in [Occlumency](/wiki/Legilimency \"Legilimency\") and\n[Legilimency](/wiki/Legilimency \"Legilimency\"). Dumbledore is an expert at\nTransfiguration too, having taught the subject before becoming headmaster. He\nfrequently creates complex objects like sofa chairs out of thin air (or from\nless comfortable chairs). Dumbledore is also proficient at Charms and Potions;\naccording to the obituary written by [Elphias Doge](/wiki/Elphias_Doge\n\"Elphias Doge\"), his papers were published in journals such as _Achievements\nin Charming_ and _The Practical Potioneer_. Dumbledore is famous for defeating\nGrindelwald, who is second on a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All\nTime only to Voldemort himself, in a \"spectacular duel of legend\", succeeding\nin doing so despite the fact that Grindelwald possessed the Elder Wand, which\nsupposedly guarantees invincibility in duels due to its power. His skill at\nduelling is further shown when he calmly engages Voldemort in _Harry Potter\nand the Order of the Phoenix_ , overpowering him and eventually forcing him to\npossess Harry to be spared from total defeat. (It is known in retrospect that\nDumbledore possessed the Elder Wand when duelling Voldemort, having taken it\nfrom Grindelwald.) Unlike most wizards who make a distinct popping sound when\nthey apparate, Dumbledore notably is able to apparate silently; the only other\nwizard shown to possess this skill is Voldemort. Dumbledore is known to be\nable to understand Mermish and\n[Gobbledegook](/wiki/Gobbledygook#Cultural_influence \"Gobbledygook\") (Goblin\nlanguage) and Parseltongue.[33]\n\n### Possessions\n\nDumbledore's office houses \"a number of curious [...] instruments.\" Among them\nis a [Pensieve](/wiki/Pensieve \"Pensieve\"), a stone receptacle used to store\nand review memories, which witches and wizards are able to extract from their\nheads as a type of fluid. Harry first discovers this device in _[Goblet of\nFire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire \"Harry Potter and the Goblet\nof Fire\")_ , and it is frequently used for\n[flashback](/wiki/Flashback_\\(narrative\\) \"Flashback \\(narrative\\)\") scenes\nthroughout the remainder of the series. In the first chapter of _Philosopher\n's Stone_, Dumbledore is seen using the [Deluminator](/wiki/Deluminator\n\"Deluminator\"), a device for removing and later returning light, and for use\nas a homing device. It is confirmed in _Deathly Hallows_ when the object is\ninherited by Ron that the Deluminator is of Dumbledore's own design.\nDumbledore is the possessor and master of the [Elder Wand](/wiki/Elder_Wand\n\"Elder Wand\"), an extremely powerful object known also as the \"Wand of\nDestiny\" or the \"Deathstick\", and one of the [Deathly\nHallows](/wiki/Deathly_Hallows_\\(object\\) \"Deathly Hallows \\(object\\)\").\nUnlike many of the wand's previous owners, Dumbledore keeps its identity a\nclosely guarded secret. He also has a pet\n[phoenix](/wiki/Phoenix_\\(mythology\\) \"Phoenix \\(mythology\\)\") named\n[Fawkes](/wiki/Magical_creatures_\\(Harry_Potter\\)#Fawkes \"Magical creatures\n\\(Harry Potter\\)\"). It is revealed in _Philosopher 's Stone_ by [Mr.\nOllivander](/wiki/Mr._Ollivander \"Mr. Ollivander\") that Harry's\n[wand](/wiki/List_of_wands_in_Harry_Potter \"List of wands in Harry Potter\")\ncarries a phoenix feather as its magical core and that particular phoenix only\ngave one other feather, the one in Voldemort's wand that gave Harry his scar.\nIt is later revealed in _Goblet of Fire_ that Fawkes was the phoenix whose\nfeathers provide the magical core in Harry's and Voldemort's wands.\n\n### Family\n\nThrough various interviews and discussions about the character, Rowling has\nestablished that Albus Dumbledore was born in July or August[34][35] 1881[36]\nto Percival and Kendra Dumbledore.[12] The character had previously referenced\nhis brother [Aberforth](/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore \"Aberforth Dumbledore\"),\nand in _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ , it is revealed that Albus is\nthree years older than Aberforth. The same book established their sister\nAriana who, at six years old, suffered a vicious attack by three male Muggle\nyouths who had witnessed her doing magic. Frightened, they first tried to get\nher to repeat what they had seen, and upon her failure to recreate it due to\nher young age, they tried to stop her from being \"different\". It is not\nexplicitly stated in the novel what form this attack took, but Percival was\nsentenced to life in Azkaban for tracking down and hexing the boys who\nseriously traumatised his daughter. The severe [trauma](/wiki/Post-\ntraumatic_stress_disorder \"Post-traumatic stress disorder\") of the attack left\nAriana unable to function socially or to properly perform magic again. To\nprevent her being institutionalised in [St. Mungo's\nHospital](/wiki/St_Mungo%27s_Hospital_for_Magical_Maladies_and_Injuries \"St\nMungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries\"), or hurting someone\naccidentally with her uncontrolled magic, Kendra moved the family to Godric's\nHollow, and her illness was concealed. Neighbours assumed that Ariana was a\nnon-magical [squib](/wiki/Blood_purity_\\(Harry_Potter\\)#Squibs \"Blood purity\n\\(Harry Potter\\)\").\n\nWhen Dumbledore and his friend Elphias left Hogwarts, they planned to take\ntheir \"then-traditional\" tour of the world. On the eve of their trip, the\neighteen-year-old Dumbledore suffered the death of his mother Kendra, who was\naccidentally killed by Ariana during one of her uncontrolled outbursts of\nmagic. Because Dumbledore's parents were absent (his father in Azkaban and his\nmother dead), Albus became the head of the family and it became his duty to\nput food on the table, as they were not left with much gold. He was forced to\nremain in his house with his sister Ariana while Aberforth completed his\neducation. Aberforth knew of his brother's resentment and offered to care for\nAriana himself, saying that she preferred him, but Albus refused by stating\nthat it was his duty as eldest to care for the family.\n\nWhen Grindelwald arrived at Godric's Hollow, he immediately became friends\nwith Dumbledore and together dreamed of a new world order in which wizards\nruled over Muggles \"for the greater good\". Dumbledore and Grindelwald\nsuggested that they had to move to carry on their plans, but Aberforth refused\nbecause Ariana's state did not allow her to be moved. The discussion between\nAlbus, Aberforth and Grindelwald turned into a duel that resulted in Ariana's\naccidental death. According to the author, as a result of this incident,\nAlbus's [boggart](/wiki/Boggart_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Boggart \\(Harry Potter\\)\")\nbecame Ariana's corpse.[37] In _Philosopher 's Stone_, he mentions to Harry\nthat the deepest desire of his heart, revealed by the Mirror of Erised, is to\nhave a pair of woollen socks. In the seventh novel, Harry realises that he and\nDumbledore see the same thing in the Mirror: their reunited families.\n\n## Reception\n\nThe character of Albus Dumbledore has been compared to other\n[archetypal](/wiki/Jungian_archetypes \"Jungian archetypes\") \"[wise old\nman](/wiki/Wise_old_man \"Wise old man\")\" characters. Dumbledore acts much like\n[Merlin](/wiki/Merlin \"Merlin\") from _[The Sword in the\nStone](/wiki/The_Sword_in_the_Stone_\\(novel\\) \"The Sword in the Stone\n\\(novel\\)\")_ , in the manner of an \"[absent-minded professor](/wiki/Absent-\nminded_professor \"Absent-minded professor\")\";[38] both Merlin and Dumbledore\neducate a story's main character in a castle. As writer Evelyn Perry notes,\n\"Dumbledore resembles Merlin both personally and physically; he is an avid\nlover of books and wisdom who wears flowing robes and a long, white\nbeard.\"[39] Dumbledore has also been compared with Gandalf from\n[Tolkien's](/wiki/J.R.R._Tolkien \"J.R.R. Tolkien\") _[Lord of the\nRings](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings \"The Lord of the Rings\")_.[40] Dave Kopel\ndraws comparisons between Rowling's writing and [John\nBunyan](/wiki/John_Bunyan \"John Bunyan\")'s _[The Pilgrim’s\nProgress](/wiki/The_Pilgrim%E2%80%99s_Progress \"The Pilgrim’s Progress\")_ and\nstates that, among the Christian symbols that Rowling has used in her books,\nDumbledore acts like \"the bearded God the Father\" figure in which Harry puts\nhis faith to be saved from Voldemort and his servants.[41] [IGN](/wiki/IGN\n\"IGN\") also listed Dumbledore as their fifth favourite _Harry Potter_\ncharacter, saying that \"[f]or a character that was introduced into popular\nculture a mere twelve years ago, it speaks volumes that Professor Dumbledore\nhas already taken his place among the great mentor figures in literature and\nfilm\".[42] IGN's Joe Utichi called Dumbledore his third favourite _Harry\nPotter_ character, calling the revelation that he wasn't so \"infallible\" one\nof the most heartbreaking themes of the final book.[43] Actor [Michael\nGambon](/wiki/Michael_Gambon \"Michael Gambon\") received some criticism for his\nlouder, more aggressive, portrayal of the character, who is depicted as\nexhibiting a more subdued, unflappable calm in the books. This has been\nattributed to Gambon's policy of not reading the source material from which\nhis films are adapted.[44]\n\nAs a main character of the series, major facts relating to Dumbledore have\ngenerated a vast number of essays and discussions. The death of Dumbledore at\nthe end of _Half-Blood Prince_ was discussed by fans and critics alike. A\nwebsite named DumbledoreIsNotDead.com sought to understand the events of the\nsixth book in a different way and provided arguments to claim that the\ncharacter did not really die.[45] However, Rowling confirmed on 2 August 2006\nthat Dumbledore was, in fact, dead, humorously apologising to the website as\nshe did so.[46] Along with DumbledoreIsNotDead.com, a collection of essays,\n_Who Killed Albus Dumbledore?: What Really Happened in Harry Potter and the\nHalf-Blood Prince? Six Expert Harry Potter Detectives Examine the Evidence_ ,\nwas published by Zossima Press in November 2006.[47] In NextMovie.com's _Harry\nPotter_ Mega Poll, Dumbledore's death was voted as the most unforgettable\nmoment in the whole series.[48]\n\nIn the _Chamber of Secrets_ DVD interview, screenwriter [Steve\nKloves](/wiki/Steve_Kloves \"Steve Kloves\") stated that he considers Dumbledore\na fascinating character because of the wisdom he provides, but he feels that\n\"Dumbledore bears such a tremendous dark burden, and he knows secrets and I\nthink in many ways he bears the weight of the future of the wizard world\" and\nthe \"only way that he can keep that at bay, the darkness, is to be whimsical\nand humorous\".[7]\n\n### Sexuality\n\n![Globe icon.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png) |  The examples and perspective in this section **deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a[worldwide view](/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias \"Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias\") of the subject**.

[Melissa Anelli](/wiki/Melissa_Anelli \"Melissa Anelli\"), webmaster of\nthe fan site [The Leaky Cauldron](/wiki/The_Leaky_Cauldron_\\(website\\) \"The\nLeaky Cauldron \\(website\\)\"), told [The Associated\nPress](/wiki/The_Associated_Press \"The Associated Press\"), \"J.K. Rowling\ncalling any _Harry Potter_ character gay would make wonderful strides in\ntolerance toward homosexuality. ... By dubbing someone so respected, so\ntalented and so kind, as someone who just happens to be also homosexual, she's\nreinforcing the idea that a person's gayness is not something of which they\nshould be ashamed.\"[49] _[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly\n\"Entertainment Weekly\")_ 's [Mark Harris](/wiki/Mark_Harris_\\(journalist\\)\n\"Mark Harris \\(journalist\\)\") said \"her choice to make a beloved professor-\nmentor gay in a world where gay teachers are still routinely slandered as\nmalign influences was, I am certain, no accident.\"[50] The stars and director\nof the _Harry Potter_ films were supportive of Rowling's revelation as\nwell.[51]\n\nSome critics discussed the implications of this statement. _[New York\nTimes](/wiki/New_York_Times \"New York Times\")_ columnist Edward Rothstein said\nthat \"Ms. Rowling may think of Dumbledore as gay\"; however, \"there is no\nreason why anyone else should\".[52] The East Tennessee State University's\nstudent newspaper accused Rowling of lying, saying her answer was a [publicity\nstunt](/wiki/Publicity_stunt \"Publicity stunt\").[53] Michelle Smith quoted the\n[Death of the Author](/wiki/Death_of_the_Author \"Death of the Author\")\nprinciple, stating that Rowling's subsequent commentary is irrelevant to the\nunderstanding of the books.[54]\n\nDumbledore's sexuality was also condemned by several right-wing Christian\ngroups, such as [Mission America](/wiki/Mission_America_\\(Columbus,_Ohio\\)\n\"Mission America \\(Columbus, Ohio\\)\") and the [Christian Coalition of\nAmerica](/wiki/Christian_Coalition_of_America \"Christian Coalition of\nAmerica\").[55]\n\n_[Slate](/wiki/Slate_\\(magazine\\) \"Slate \\(magazine\\)\")_ quotes an attendee of\nthe book talk who said, \"It was clear that JKR didn't plan to out Dumbledore.\nShe just cares about being true to her readers.\"[56] Mike Thomas of the\n_[Orlando Sentinel](/wiki/Orlando_Sentinel \"Orlando Sentinel\")_ said that upon\nreflection, Dumbledore was gay from the beginning, and that this neatly\nexplains the behaviour of his character and his relationship with Grindelwald.\nThomas notes the skill Rowling displays in writing a gay character without\nhaving to put a gay label on him.[57]\n\nGay rights campaigner [Peter Tatchell](/wiki/Peter_Tatchell \"Peter Tatchell\")\nstated that \"It's good that children's literature includes the reality of gay\npeople, since we exist in every society. But I am disappointed that she did\nnot make Dumbledore's sexuality explicit in the Harry Potter book. Making it\nobvious would have sent a much more powerful message of understanding and\nacceptance.\" A spokesperson for [Stonewall](/wiki/Stonewall_\\(charity\\)\n\"Stonewall \\(charity\\)\") praised Rowling, saying \"It's great that JK has said\nthis. It shows that there's no limit to what gay and lesbian people can do,\neven being a wizard headmaster.\"[58]\n\nRegarding Dumbledore's sexuality in the _[Fantastic\nBeasts](/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_\\(film_series\\) \"Fantastic Beasts \\(film\nseries\\)\")_ series, Rowling said in 2016 that, \"As far as his sexuality is\nconcerned, watch the space.”[59]\n\n## In popular culture\n\nDumbledore has been parodied in several sketches and animated series:\n\n  * In _[The Simpsons](/wiki/The_Simpsons \"The Simpsons\")_ episode \"[The Haw-Hawed Couple](/wiki/The_Haw-Hawed_Couple \"The Haw-Hawed Couple\")\", [Lisa](/wiki/Lisa_Simpson \"Lisa Simpson\") asks [Homer](/wiki/Homer_Simpson \"Homer Simpson\") to read her Angelica Button book to her for bedtime. Homer, learning that the character Headmaster Greystash will die (as Dumbledore did in _Half-Blood Prince_), hides the fact from Lisa by inventing a happier ending, though Lisa does read the real ending and decides that Homer's was better.[60]\n  * Dumbledore also stars in [Neil Cicierega](/wiki/Neil_Cicierega \"Neil Cicierega\")'s _Potter Puppet Pals_ , in which he frequently strips completely naked, except for his hat, randomly in the story. Also, in half of the \"Potter Puppet Pals\" videos Dumbledore is using the exclamation \"Alas!\" in an apparently incorrect place, parodying Rowling's love for unusual words. In the episode \"Ron's Disease\", Dumbledore reveals himself to be \"a gay android\".[61]\n  * Albus Dumbledore appears in some episodes of _[Robot Chicken](/wiki/Robot_Chicken \"Robot Chicken\")_ voiced by [Seth Green](/wiki/Seth_Green \"Seth Green\"). In \"Password: Swordfish\" when the threat of the puberty creature Pubertis is known, Dumbledore gives Harry a stone that might help him fight Pubertis. During this appearance, Dumbledore is an African-American who states that he is played by a different actor in each of the movies. Upon confrontation with Pubertis, Harry rubs the stone two times, which summons ghosts to punch it. When it comes to the third time, Dumbledore appears and tells Harry that the stone can only be warmed up three times a day (four if he takes a week off) and that Pubertis cannot be destroyed since it lives in everyone just like his own demon Wandus Limpus prevents him from having meaningful relationships. In \"Tell My Mum\", Dumbledore tells the students that Professor Snape suffered a \"minor potion accident\" and has enlisted [Criss Angel](/wiki/Criss_Angel \"Criss Angel\") as their substitute teacher.\n  * In 2003, [Comic Relief](/wiki/Comic_Relief_\\(charity\\) \"Comic Relief \\(charity\\)\") performed a spoof story called _Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan_ , in which Dumbledore is portrayed by [Nigel Planer](/wiki/Nigel_Planer \"Nigel Planer\"), who wore the beard and costume of late [Richard Harris](/wiki/Richard_Harris_\\(actor\\) \"Richard Harris \\(actor\\)\").[62][63]\n  * Dumbledore also appears in one of the _Harry Bladder_ sketches in _[All That](/wiki/All_That \"All That\")_ , portrayed by [Kenan Thompson](/wiki/Kenan_Thompson \"Kenan Thompson\")'s old character Principal Williame Banes Pimpell (who appeared as Headmaster Pimpell).\n  * After the revelation of Dumbledore's sexuality, the American skit comedy _[Saturday Night Live](/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live \"Saturday Night Live\")_ featured a sketch featuring Rowling (played by [Amy Poehler](/wiki/Amy_Poehler \"Amy Poehler\")) showing deleted scenes from _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ where Dumbledore (played by [Bill Hader](/wiki/Bill_Hader \"Bill Hader\")) acts stereotypically gay.[64]\n  * In _[A Very Potter Musical](/wiki/A_Very_Potter_Musical \"A Very Potter Musical\")_ , Dumbledore is played by actor Dylan Saunders.\n  * Dumbledore appears in an episode of Icons of Teen from the [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\") channel, Shut Up Cartoons voiced by [Justin Roiland](/wiki/Justin_Roiland \"Justin Roiland\"). As a teenager, Dumbledore liked to do magic and make robotic copies of himself. One day, he went scuba diving to earn his scuba diving badge for scouts. Dumbledore gets scared and stays on the boat while his crush Charlene and the scoutmaster go diving. They run into a giant sea monster and Charlene closes her eyes and says Dumbledore, a trick he taught her. Dumbledore receives her distress signal and dives in after them. He meets a talking dolphin who agrees to help Dumbledore if he can eat him in the end. Dumbledore suggests he eat the scoutmaster and the dolphin takes him to his friends. Dumbledore makes a robotic copy and sends it into the creature's stomach, distracting the creature long enough for Dumbledore, Charlene and the scoutmaster to escape. Charlene thanks Dumbledore for saving them. Dumbledore makes a sexual comment but plays it off like she said it. Charlene asks where the scoutmaster is; Dumbledore says he's gone somewhere, when really the dolphin ate him. Dumbledore then decides to build a robot copy of the scoutmaster to prevent anyone from finding out what happened to him.\n  * Albus Dumbledore appears in _[The Lego Movie](/wiki/The_Lego_Movie \"The Lego Movie\")_ , though his voice actor is not credited. He is seen among the Master Builders who meet with Vitruvius in Cloud Cuckoo Land, including a Lego version of Gandalf from _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Hirsch, Anne-Christin (2008).
