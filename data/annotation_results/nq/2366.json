It is often\nwritten as the **1st century[AD](/wiki/Anno_Domini \"Anno Domini\")**[1] or\n**1st century[CE](/wiki/Common_Era \"Common Era\")** to distinguish it from the\n[1st century BC](/wiki/1st_century_BC \"1st century BC\") (or BCE) which\npreceded it. The 1st century is considered part of the [Classical\nera](/wiki/Classical_era \"Classical era\"), epoch, or [historical\nperiod](/wiki/History_by_period \"History by period\").\n\nDuring this period, Europe, North Africa and the Near East fell under\nincreasing domination by the [Roman Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman\nEmpire\"), which continued expanding, most notably conquering\n[Britain](/wiki/Britannia \"Britannia\") under the emperor\n[Claudius](/wiki/Claudius \"Claudius\") ([AD 43](/wiki/AD_43 \"AD 43\")). The\nreforms introduced by [Augustus](/wiki/Augustus \"Augustus\") during his long\nreign stabilized the empire after the turmoil of the previous century's civil\nwars. Later in the century the [Julio-Claudian dynasty](/wiki/Julio-\nClaudian_dynasty \"Julio-Claudian dynasty\"), which had been founded by\n[Augustus](/wiki/Augustus \"Augustus\"), came to an end with the suicide of\n[Nero](/wiki/Nero \"Nero\") in [AD 68](/wiki/AD_68 \"AD 68\"). There followed the\nfamous [Year of Four Emperors](/wiki/Year_of_Four_Emperors \"Year of Four\nEmperors\"), a brief period of civil war and instability, which was finally\nbrought to an end by [Vespasian](/wiki/Vespasian \"Vespasian\"), ninth Roman\nemperor, and founder of the [Flavian dynasty](/wiki/Flavian_dynasty \"Flavian\ndynasty\"). The Roman Empire generally experienced a period of prosperity and\ndominance in this period and the First Century is remembered as part of the\nEmpire's golden age.\n\nThe 1st century saw the [appearance of\nChristianity](/wiki/Christianity_in_the_1st_century \"Christianity in the 1st\ncentury\").\n\nChina continued to be dominated by the [Han Dynasty](/wiki/Han_Dynasty \"Han\nDynasty\"), despite a fourteen-year interruption by the [Xin\ndynasty](/wiki/Xin_dynasty \"Xin dynasty\") under [Wang Mang](/wiki/Wang_Mang\n\"Wang Mang\"). Han rule was restored in [AD 23](/wiki/AD_23 \"AD 23\"); Wang\nMang's rule represents the watershed between the Western/Former Han and the\nEastern/Later Han. [The capital was also\nmoved](/wiki/History_of_the_Han_Dynasty \"History of the Han Dynasty\") from\n[Chang'an](/wiki/Chang%27an \"Chang'an\") to [Luoyang](/wiki/Luoyang \"Luoyang\").\n\n##
