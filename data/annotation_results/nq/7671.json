It was\nreleased in March 1979 as the second single from the album _[The Two and\nOnly](/wiki/The_Two_and_Only \"The Two and Only\")_. The song became their first\nnumber 1 hit on the _[Billboard magazine](/wiki/Billboard_magazine \"Billboard\nmagazine\")_ [Hot Country Singles](/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs \"Hot Country Songs\")\nchart and their second number one overall, after their 1976 pop hit \"[Let Your\nLove Flow](/wiki/Let_Your_Love_Flow \"Let Your Love Flow\")\". The title as shown\non the original single was **\" If I Said You Have a Beautiful Body Would You\nHold It Against Me\"**,[1] but on the album and subsequent releases, the title\nis shown as \"...

Songwriter David Bellamy told\ncountry music journalist Tom Roland that he regularly watched Marx's program,\n_[You Bet Your Life](/wiki/You_Bet_Your_Life \"You Bet Your Life\")_ , where\nMarx sometimes used the quote while interviewing an attractive female\ncontestant, then shake his cigar and raise his eyebrows to elicit a\nreaction.[2] The comment stuck in Bellamy's head as a possible hook line for a\nsong.\n\nThe song earned its first success in [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland\n\"Northern Ireland\")[3] before becoming a hit in the United States. The song\nwas also a minor hit on Top 40 stations, peaking at No. 39 on the Billboard\nHot 100.\n\nIn a 2003 issue, _[Country Weekly](/wiki/Country_Weekly \"Country Weekly\")_\nmagazine named it the number 1 country pick-up line of all time.\n\n## Re-\nrecording[[edit](/w/index.php?title=If_I_Said_You_Had_a_Beautiful_Body_Would_You_Hold_It_Against_Me&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Re-recording\")]\n\nOn their 2005 album _[Angels& Outlaws, Vol.\n1](/w/index.php?title=Angels_%26_Outlaws,_Vol._1&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Angels\n& Outlaws, Vol. 1 \\(page does not exist\\)\")_, The Bellamy Brothers re-recorded\nthis song with [Dolly Parton](/wiki/Dolly_Parton \"Dolly Parton\"). This\nrendition peaked at number 60 on the country charts, giving the Bellamy\nBrothers their first chart entry since \"Not\" in 1994.\n\n## Britney Spears\ncontroversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=If_I_Said_You_Had_a_Beautiful_Body_Would_You_Hold_It_Against_Me&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Britney Spears controversy\")]\n\nIn 2011, the Brothers criticized pop singer [Britney\nSpears](/wiki/Britney_Spears \"Britney Spears\")'s song \"[Hold It Against\nMe](/wiki/Hold_It_Against_Me \"Hold It Against Me\")\" for sounding similar to\n**\" If I Said You Had A Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me\"**. In a\nstatement, David Bellamy said \"professionally, well, in all honesty, we feel\ncompletely ripped off. Where's the originality?\"[4] The Bellamy Brothers'\nattorney Christopher E. Schmidt stated that \"[it] becomes somewhat uncanny if\nyou simply double the beat of the Bellamy Brothers' song and match it up with\nBritney's version\" and pointed out that it was not the first time that\nsongwriters [Max Martin](/wiki/Max_Martin \"Max Martin\") and [Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\"\nGottwald](/wiki/Dr._Luke \"Dr. Luke\") were accused of [copyright\ninfringement](/wiki/Copyright_infringement \"Copyright infringement\").[5] On\nMarch 2, 2011, Max Martin, Dr. Luke, [Bonnie McKee](/wiki/Bonnie_McKee \"Bonnie\nMcKee\"), and Mathieu \"Billboard\" Jomphe, all of whom wrote \"Hold It Against\nMe\", filed a lawsuit against the Bellamy Brothers for defamation and libel\nbecause of the accusations,[6] but the Brothers apologized and the case was\ndismissed on August 11, 2011. The Brothers released a statement that said,\n\"The Bellamy Brothers apologise to Dr. Luke and Max Martin for the Bellamys'\npublic statements and any false impressions suggested by the statements on\ntheir website that Dr. Luke and Max Martin copy the works of others.\"[7]\n\n## Chart\nperformance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=If_I_Said_You_Had_a_Beautiful_Body_Would_You_Hold_It_Against_Me&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Chart performance\")]\n\nChart (1979) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nCanadian _RPM_ Country Tracks | 24  \nUK Singles Chart | 3  \nUS [Hot Country Songs](/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs \"Hot Country Songs\") (_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_)[8] | 1  \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[9] | 39  \nDutch Top 40 | 11  \nNew Zealand Singles Chart | 17  \nPreceded by  \n\"[Don't Take It Away](/wiki/Don%27t_Take_It_Away \"Don't Take It Away\")\"  \nby [Conway Twitty](/wiki/Conway_Twitty \"Conway Twitty\") | **_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_ [Hot Country Singles](/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs \"Hot Country Songs\")  \nnumber-one single**  \nMay 19â€“June 2, 1979 | Succeeded by  \n\"[She Believes in Me](/wiki/She_Believes_in_Me \"She Believes in Me\")\"  \nby [Kenny Rogers](/wiki/Kenny_Rogers \"Kenny Rogers\")  \n---|---|---  \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=If_I_Said_You_Had_a_Beautiful_Body_Would_You_Hold_It_Against_Me&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** \"The Billboard Book of Number One Country Hits\" (Billboard Books, Watson-Guptill Publications, New York, 1991 ([ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-82-307553-2](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-82-307553-2 \"Special:BookSources/0-82-307553-2\"))), p. 233-234.\n  2. **Jump up ^** Roland.\n  3. **Jump up ^** [Bellamy brothers are coming ... so don't hold that song against them](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2514572.ece)\n  4. **Jump up ^** Staff, The Salt Lake Tribune (January 11, 2011).
