Memory\nimpairment due to alcohol has been linked to disruption of\n[hippocampal](/wiki/Hippocampus \"Hippocampus\") function—in particular\naffecting [gamma-Aminobutyric acid](/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid \"Gamma-\nAminobutyric acid\") (GABA) and [N-methyl-D-aspartate](/wiki/N-methyl-D-\naspartate \"N-methyl-D-aspartate\") (NMDA) neurotransmission which negatively\nimpacts [long-term potentiation](/wiki/Long-term_potentiation \"Long-term\npotentiation\") (LTP).[2] The molecular basis of LTP is associated with\nlearning and memory.[3] Particularly, damage to [hippocampal CA1\ncells](/wiki/Hippocampus_anatomy \"Hippocampus anatomy\") adversely affects\nmemory formation,[4] and this disruption has been linked to dose-dependent\nlevels of alcohol consumption.[5] At higher doses, alcohol significantly\ninhibits neuronal activity in the CA1 and CA3 [pyramidal\ncell](/wiki/Pyramidal_cell \"Pyramidal cell\") layers of the\n[hippocampus](/wiki/Hippocampus \"Hippocampus\").[6][7][8] This impairs memory\nencoding[9] since the hippocampus plays an important role in the formation of\nnew memories.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Hippocampal-\npyramidal-cell.png/220px-Hippocampal-pyramidal-\ncell.png)](/wiki/File:Hippocampal-pyramidal-cell.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hippocampal-pyramidal-cell.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA Hippocampal Pyramidal Cell\n\n### Molecular effects on GABA and NMDA\nreceptors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Molecular effects on GABA and NMDA receptors\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/GABAA_receptor_schematic.png/220px-\nGABAA_receptor_schematic.png)](/wiki/File:GABAA_receptor_schematic.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:GABAA_receptor_schematic.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA GABAA Receptor\n\n[Alcohol](/wiki/Alcohol \"Alcohol\") acts as a positive\n[allosteric](/wiki/Allosteric \"Allosteric\") modulator of GABA\n[receptors](/wiki/Receptor_\\(biochemistry\\) \"Receptor \\(biochemistry\\)\"),\nspecifically type [GABAA](/wiki/GABAA \"GABAA\").[10] Upon activation, these\nGABA receptors conduct [Cl-](/wiki/Cl- \"Cl-\"), resulting in\n[neuronal](/wiki/Neuron \"Neuron\")\n[hyperpolarization](/wiki/Hyperpolarization_\\(biology\\) \"Hyperpolarization\n\\(biology\\)\"). This hyperpolarization decreases the chance of an [action\npotential](/wiki/Action_potential \"Action potential\") occurring and, thus, has\nan inhibitory effect on [neurotransmission](/wiki/Neurotransmission\n\"Neurotransmission\") in the [central nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Central_nervous_system \"Central nervous system\"). GABAA receptor\nsubtypes vary in their sensitivity to dosage of alcohol consumed. Furthermore,\nacute alcohol intake promotes GABAergic neurotransmission via\n[presynaptic](/wiki/Chemical_synapse \"Chemical synapse\") release of GABA,\ndephosphorylation of GABAA receptors (increasing GABA sensitivity), and\nelevation of [endogenous](/wiki/Endogeny \"Endogeny\") GABAergic [neuroactive\nsteroids](/wiki/Neuroactive_steroid \"Neuroactive steroid\").[11] [Protein\nkinase C](/wiki/Protein_kinase_C \"Protein kinase C\") (PKC) has been implicated\nin differentially modulating the response of the GABAA receptor to alcohol,\nwith effects depending on the PKC [isozyme](/wiki/Isozyme \"Isozyme\").[12]\nAlcohol effects have also implicated [protein kinase A](/wiki/Protein_kinase_A\n\"Protein kinase A\") in affecting GABAA receptor function, such as promoting\nsensitivity.[13] Enhancement of GABAergic transmission due to alcohol\nconsumption can also be brought about by neuroactive steroids, such as\n[allopregnanolone](/wiki/Allopregnanolone \"Allopregnanolone\"), which act as\nGABAA receptor [agonists](/wiki/Agonist \"Agonist\").[11][14] Chronic alcohol\nconsumption and alcohol dependence are correlated with altered expression,\nproperties, and functions of the GABAA receptor that may contribute to alcohol\ntolerance.[11] There is still much to be discovered about alcohol’s specific\nand varying effects on the GABAA receptor and its subtypes.\n\nAt higher doses, ethanol also affects [NMDA receptors](/wiki/NMDA_receptor\n\"NMDA receptor\") (NMDARs) by inhibiting the [ion](/wiki/Ion \"Ion\") current\ninduced by NMDA, a [glutamate receptor](/wiki/Glutamate_receptor \"Glutamate\nreceptor\") agonist.[15] This inhibition of synaptic excitation by alcohol has\nbeen shown to be dose-dependent (up to a certain point, after which it did not\ndiffer by much).[16] Alcohol appears to produce this inhibition by using a\nsite of the NMDAR that is accessible from the\n[extracellular](/wiki/Extracellular \"Extracellular\") environment.[17] Thusly,\nthis inhibition of an ion current usually produced by NMDAR activation leads\nto decreased LTP in hippocampal areas.[18] Alcohol negatively affects LTP to a\ngreater degree in immature versus mature animals.[19] In adolescents, alcohol\ndecreases the expression of the NMDAR NR2A subunit in the hippocampus and the\nNR1 subunit in the prefrontal cortex.[20] Studies have also found a decrease\nin phosphorylation of 2B subunit in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus,\nnucleus accumbens, and striatum.[21] NMDARS may be affected by PKA regulation\ndue to the actions of alcohol.[22] Alcohol’s effects on GABAA\nneurotransmission may indirectly inhibit the activity of the NMDAR and\ncontribute to its blockade of LTP induction; however, alcohol’s direct effects\non NMDAR alone are sufficient for the inhibition of LTP.[23] The varying dose-\ndependent response to alcohol relies on the combined interactions and\nresponses of the GABAA receptors, NMDARs, and metabotropic glutamate receptors\nsubtype 5 ([mGluR5](/wiki/MGluR5 \"MGluR5\")).[24][25][26] These changes prevent\nexcitatory [synaptic transmissions](/wiki/Synaptic_transmission \"Synaptic\ntransmission\") from occurring, affecting [synaptic\nplasticity](/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity \"Synaptic plasticity\") and, in turn,\n[memory](/wiki/Memory \"Memory\") and [learning](/wiki/Learning \"Learning\").\nHowever, there is still much to be elucidated concerning specific molecular\nmechanisms of how alcohol affects memory formation.\n\n### Effects on other brain\nregions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Effects on other brain regions\")]\n\nAlcohol also impairs and alters functioning in the\n[cerebellum](/wiki/Cerebellum \"Cerebellum\"), which affects motor function and\ncoordination.[27] It has a notable inhibitory effect on neurons of the\n[cerebral cortex](/wiki/Cerebral_cortex \"Cerebral cortex\"), affecting and\naltering thought processes, decreasing inhibition, and increasing the pain\nthreshold. It also decreases sexual performance by depressing nerve centers in\nthe [hypothalamus](/wiki/Hypothalamus \"Hypothalamus\").[28][29] Alcohol also\nhas an effect on urine excretion via inhibition of [anti-diuretic\nhormone](/wiki/Anti-diuretic_hormone \"Anti-diuretic hormone\")\n([ADH](/wiki/Vasopressin \"Vasopressin\")) secretion of the [pituitary\ngland](/wiki/Pituitary_gland \"Pituitary gland\"). Lastly, it depresses\nbreathing and heart rate by inhibiting neuronal functioning of the\n[medulla](/wiki/Medulla_oblongata \"Medulla oblongata\").[30]\n\n## Long-term\nmemory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Long-term memory\")]\n\n**[Long-term memory](/wiki/Long-term_memory \"Long-term memory\")** (LTM) has a\nlong duration and large capacity.[31] Memories stored in LTM can last from a\nfew days to a lifetime.[31] LTM consists of [explicit\nmemory](/wiki/Explicit_memory \"Explicit memory\") (requiring conscious\nawareness) and [implicit memory](/wiki/Implicit_memory \"Implicit memory\")\n(unconscious awareness).[31] Information selected for LTM goes through three\nprocesses. First, in the [encoding](/wiki/Encoding \"Encoding\") stage,\ninformation from the senses is incorporated into mental activity in the form\nof a memory.[31] Secondly, [storage](/wiki/Storage_\\(memory\\) \"Storage\n\\(memory\\)\") involves taking this information and holding it indefinitely in\nmemory.[31] Lastly, retrieval is the ability to recall information from the\nlong-term memory storage. Each of these processes can be affected by\nalcohol.[31]\n\n[![Hippocampus.gif](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Hippocampus.gif/220px-\nHippocampus.gif)](/wiki/File:Hippocampus.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hippocampus.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nAnimation: Hippocampus (red)\n\n### Explicit\nmemory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Explicit memory\")]\n\n**[Explicit memory](/wiki/Explicit_memory \"Explicit memory\")** requires\nconscious and intentional effort for recall.[31] It includes both [episodic\nmemory](/wiki/Episodic_memory \"Episodic memory\") (for specific events, such as\na party) and [semantic memory](/wiki/Semantic_memory \"Semantic memory\") (for\ngeneral information, such as one's name).[31]\n\nAlcohol impairs episodic encoding, specifically for cued recall, recognition\nof completed word fragments, and free recall.[32] A\n[blackout](/wiki/Blackout_\\(alcohol-related_amnesia\\) \"Blackout \\(alcohol-\nrelated amnesia\\)\") is an example of a difficulty in [encoding](/wiki/Encoding\n\"Encoding\") episodic memories due to [alcohol](/wiki/Alcohol \"Alcohol\").\nBlackouts are caused by a rapid increase in [blood alcohol\nconcentration](/wiki/Blood_alcohol_concentration \"Blood alcohol\nconcentration\") (BAC) which in turn distorts the neurons in the\n[hippocampus](/wiki/Hippocampus \"Hippocampus\").[33] This distortion impairs a\nperson's ability to form new episodic memories.[33]\n\nHigh doses of [alcohol](/wiki/Alcohol \"Alcohol\") severely disrupt the storage\nprocess of semantic memories.[34] [Alcohol](/wiki/Alcohol \"Alcohol\") was found\nto impair the storage of novel stimuli but not that of previously learned\ninformation.[34] Since alcohol affects the [central nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Central_nervous_system \"Central nervous system\"), it hinders\nsemantic storage functioning by restricting the consolidation of the\ninformation from encoding.[34]\n\nRetrieval of [explicit memory](/wiki/Explicit_memory \"Explicit memory\") is\nsignificantly impaired by [alcohol](/wiki/Alcohol \"Alcohol\"). When compared to\nsober participants, intoxicated participants performed quite poorly on a\nrecall task for everyday events (episodic memory).[35] Intoxicated\nparticipants are also slower to respond in reaction time tasks.[36] Alcohol\nalso impairs retrieval in word recognition tasks.[32] When both encoding and\nretrieval take place during intoxication, there are surprisingly more\nimpairments for cued recall than for free recall.[32] In terms of gender\ndifferences in retrieval processes, females tend to score lower than males on\nrecall tasks when intoxicated.[36]\n\n### Implicit\nmemory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Implicit memory\")]\n\n**[Implicit memory](/wiki/Implicit_memory \"Implicit memory\")** does not\nrequire conscious effort or intention for recall.[31] It occurs when previous\nexperience influences performance on a certain task.[31] This is evident in\n[priming](/wiki/Priming_\\(psychology\\) \"Priming \\(psychology\\)\") experiments.\n[Implicit memory](/wiki/Implicit_memory \"Implicit memory\") includes\n[procedural memory](/wiki/Procedural_memory \"Procedural memory\"), which\ninfluences our everyday behaviours, such as riding a bike or tying shoes.[31]\nPeople can perform these abilities without thinking about them, which means\n[procedural memory](/wiki/Procedural_memory \"Procedural memory\") functions\nautomatically. While retrieval of [explicit memory](/wiki/Explicit_memory\n\"Explicit memory\") is severely impaired by alcohol, retrieval of [implicit\nmemory](/wiki/Implicit_memory \"Implicit memory\") is not.[35] Intoxicated\nsubjects score higher on recognition tasks (involving [implicit\nmemory](/wiki/Implicit_memory \"Implicit memory\")) than on recall tasks\n(involving [explicit memory](/wiki/Explicit_memory \"Explicit memory\")).[35]\n\n## Short-term\nmemory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Short-term memory\")]\n\n[Short-term memory](/wiki/Short-term_memory \"Short-term memory\") refers to\ntemporary storage of small amounts of information over short delays.[31]\n[Digit span](/wiki/Digit_span \"Digit span\") refers to the proposed number of\npieces of information (5-9) that can be held in short-term memory. This is\nalso referred to as the magic number seven – plus or minus two. Any more\npieces of information than this, and newer items replace previous items.[37]\n[Alcohol intoxication](/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication \"Alcohol intoxication\") has\nbeen found to have dissociative effects on short-term memory and cognitive\nfunctioning.[38][39]\n\n[![Gray727_anterior_cingulate_cortex.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Gray727_anterior_cingulate_cortex.png/220px-\nGray727_anterior_cingulate_cortex.png)](/wiki/File:Gray727_anterior_cingulate_cortex.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gray727_anterior_cingulate_cortex.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nAnterior Cingulate Cortex (yellow)\n\n[![Parietal_lobe_animation_small.gif](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Parietal_lobe_animation_small.gif)](/wiki/File:Parietal_lobe_animation_small.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Parietal_lobe_animation_small.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nAnimation: Parietal Lobe (red)\n\n### Brain areas affected by\nalcohol[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Brain areas affected by alcohol\")]\n\nAlcohol affects brain functioning.

Short-term memory,\nespecially for non-verbal and spatial material, are impaired by\nintoxication.[44] Alcohol decreases [iconic memory](/wiki/Iconic_memory\n\"Iconic memory\") (a type of visual short-term memory).[45] With BACs between\n80–84 mg/dl, more intrusion errors occur in a delayed recall task compared to\na control group.[46] Intrusion errors, which represent reflective cognitive\nfunctioning, occur when irrelevant information is produced. Alcoholics have\nless control of inhibiting intrusions.[46] Acute alcohol intoxication in\nsocial drinkers caused more intrusion errors in delayed recall tasks than in\nimmediate free recall tasks.[46] Acute alcohol intoxication increases\nsusceptibility to interference, which allows for more intrusion errors when\nthere is a short delay.[46] [Free recall](/wiki/Free_recall \"Free recall\")\n(given list of words then asked to recall list) is significantly lower and\ntherefore impaired by alcohol intoxication.[47][48] [Encoding](/wiki/Encoding\n\"Encoding\") deficits were found in verbal free recall and recognition tasks\nunder the influence of alcohol.[49] A discrimination task found significant\nalcohol-related impairments in [depth perception](/wiki/Depth_perception\n\"Depth perception\") and in [visual short-term memory](/wiki/Visual_short-\nterm_memory \"Visual short-term memory\").[50] [State-dependent\nlearning](/wiki/State-dependent_learning \"State-dependent learning\") and\nrelearning studies in male heavy drinkers demonstrate that the condition of\nintoxication while learning and sobriety when tested caused a performance\ndeficit in free recall tasks.[51] These findings are supportive of alcohol-\ninduced storage deficits (not retrieval deficits).[51] The effects of acute\nalcohol consumption on visual short-term memory, stereoscopic depth\nperception, and attention were studied. A 33% alcohol condition showed\nsignificant impairments in depth perception and in visual short-term memory\n(assessed by the vernier discrimination task).[52]\n\n[![Working_memory_model.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Working_memory_model.svg/220px-\nWorking_memory_model.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Working_memory_model.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Working_memory_model.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWorking Memory Model. Alcohol intoxication can disrupt rehearsal strategies\nwhich may involve the phonological loop and/or the visuospatial sketchpad.\n\n## Effects on working\nmemory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Effects on working memory\")]\n\n[Working memory](/wiki/Working_memory \"Working memory\") allows one to keep\nthings in mind while simultaneously performing complex tasks.[31] It involves\na system for the temporary storage and manipulation of information, forming a\ncrucial link between perception and controlled action.[53] Evidence suggests\nthat working memory involves three components: the _[central\nexecutive](/wiki/Central_executive \"Central executive\")_ which controls\nattention, the _visuo-spatial sketchpad_ which holds and manipulates spatial\ninformation, and the _phonological loop_ which performs a similar function for\nauditory and speech-based information.[53]\n\n### In the short\nterm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: In the short term\")]\n\nAlcohol consumption has substantial, measurable effects on working memory,\nthough these effects vary greatly between individual responses. Little is\nknown about the neural mechanisms that underlie these individual\ndifferences.[54] It is also found that alcohol impairs working memory by\naffecting mnemonic strategies and executive processes rather than by shrinking\nthe basic holding capacity of working memory. Isolated acute-moderate levels\nof alcohol intoxication do not profoundly physically alter the structures\nwhich are critical for working memory function, such as the [frontal\ncortex](/wiki/Frontal_cortex \"Frontal cortex\"), [parietal\ncortex](/wiki/Parietal_cortex \"Parietal cortex\"), [anterior\ncingulate](/wiki/Anterior_cingulate \"Anterior cingulate\"), and parts of the\n[basal ganglia](/wiki/Basal_ganglia \"Basal ganglia\").[38] One finding\nregarding the effects of alcohol on working memory points out that alcohol\nreduces working memory only in individuals with a high baseline working memory\ncapacity,[55] which suggests that alcohol might not uniformly affect working\nmemory in different individuals. Alcohol appears to impair the capacity of\nworking memory to modulate response inhibition.[55] Alcohol disinhibits\nbehaviour, but only in individuals with a low baseline working memory\ncapacity.[55] An interesting finding is that incentive to perform well with\nworking memory measurement tasks while under the influence of alcohol '_does_\nin fact have some effect on working memory, in that it boosts scores in rate\nof mental scanning and reaction time to stimulus, but did not reduce number of\nerrors compared to subjects with no incentive to perform well.[56] Even acute\nalcohol intoxication (a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08-0.09%) produces a\nsubstantial impairment of working memory processes that require mnemonic\nrehearsal strategies.[38] Alcohol is less likely to impair a working memory\ntask that does not rely on [memory rehearsal](/wiki/Memory_rehearsal \"Memory\nrehearsal\") or associated mnemonic strategies.[38] Because of this, working\nmemory is very susceptible to falter when a person is participating in tasks\ninvolving retention concerning auditory and visual sequences.[38] A real world\nand interesting example of this is failure of guitarists or other musicians\nperforming concerts to cue in on auditory patterns and make it known that\ntheir performance is hindered by intoxication, whereas professional basketball\n(a less sequence-heavy activity for working memory) standout [Ron\nArtest](/wiki/Ron_Artest \"Ron Artest\") recently admitted in an interview with\n_[Sporting News](/wiki/Sporting_News \"Sporting News\")_ to drinking heavily\nduring half-time in the early days of his career and it having little if any\nrecognizable effect on his working memory. His former coach Fran Fraschilla\nhas gone on record saying:[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n> \"It's a surprise because every day at practice, he came out in a mood to\n> play.

Findings\nhave shown that for working memory to be substantially affected, long-term,\nheavy drinking must be sustained over a long period of time as up to one drink\nper day does not impair cognitive function and may actually decrease the risk\nof cognitive decline.[57] Furthermore, chronic [alcoholism](/wiki/Alcoholism\n\"Alcoholism\") is associated with impairment in sustained attention and visual\nworking memory. Thus, alcoholics have reduced ability, but not necessarily\n_inability_ , to perform these executive tasks, assumed to be subserved by\nregions of [prefrontal cortex](/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex \"Prefrontal\ncortex\").[58] While it may not serve as a surprise that chronic alcoholism has\nbeen linked to decreased cognitive function including working memory, one\nsurprising finding is not only that even moderate levels of alcohol\nconsumption during pregnancy were shown to have an adverse effect on the\nchild's working memory when tested at 7.5 years of age, but that working\nmemory may be the most important aspect of attention that is adversely\naffected by prenatal alcohol exposure.[59]\n\n## Prospective\nmemory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Prospective memory\")]\n\n_[Prospective memory](/wiki/Prospective_memory \"Prospective memory\")_ involves\nremembering to carry out an intended action in the future without an explicit\nreminder.[31] Alcohol has been found to impair this ability. Chronic heavy\nalcohol users report significantly more prospective forgetting compared to\nlow-dose and alcohol-free controls.[60] The Prospective Memory Questionnaire\nassesses short-term habitual prospective memory, long-term episodic\nprospective memory, and internally cued prospective memory.[60] Chronic heavy\nalcohol users reported significantly greater deficits for all three aspects of\nprospective memory.[60] Individuals that report heavy alcohol use report 24%\nmore difficulties with prospective memory than those who report that they are\nlight drinkers and 30% more difficulties than those who report that they never\ndrink.[61] The effects of alcohol on prospective memory can also be assessed\nin the laboratory by simulating prospective memory tasks that individuals face\nin everyday life. Individuals who are given 0.6 g/kg alcohol prior to\nperforming prospective memory tasks do significantly poorer than a\n[placebo](/wiki/Placebo \"Placebo\") group.[62] Alcohol can damage the\nprefrontal and frontal areas of the brain, and this may be responsible for\nprospective memory impairments since prospective memory performance is highly\ncorrelated with frontal executive functions.[60]\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: In popular culture\")]\n\nThe memory inhibiting effects of alcohol are often a prominent topic in\npopular culture. It appears in movies, books, and television shows. Several\nmovies show characters drinking alcohol to the point of memory loss and\nawakening the next morning with a host of problems due to actions they\nperformed while intoxicated.\n\nOne example is _The Hangover_ , where three groomsmen lose the groom during a\nbachelor party in Las Vegas, so they retrace their steps to find him.[63] The\ncharacters still had functioning implicit/procedural memory, which allowed\nthem to carry out the many acts they performed that night, but their episodic\nmemory was impaired and thus they had no recollection of the events occurring.\nIn addition to alcohol the characters were also under the influence of\n[flunitrazepam](/wiki/Flunitrazepam \"Flunitrazepam\").\n\nAnother movie is _What Happens in Vegas_. After an intoxicated night in \"Sin\nCity,\" two people wake-up to find they got married.[64]\n\nSongs such as _Waking Up in Vegas_ by [Katy Perry](/wiki/Katy_Perry \"Katy\nPerry\")[65] and _Last Name_ by [Carrie Underwood](/wiki/Carrie_Underwood\n\"Carrie Underwood\")[66] also depict characters waking up and not remembering\nthe night before due to alcohol consumption.\n\nBy some accounts, popular culture makes light of the memory problems that can\nresult from alcohol consumption.\n\nThe court case [R. v. Daviault](/wiki/R._v._Daviault \"R. v. Daviault\") [1994]\nconcerned the viability of a legal defense based on intoxication.\n\nLaw and Order: Special Victims Unit; in season 11 episode 4, Hammered, a\nrecovering alcoholic was coersed to drink by a business partner and later\nwakes up to a dead woman in his bed.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Confabulation](/wiki/Confabulation \"Confabulation\")\n  * [Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome](/wiki/Wernicke%E2%80%93Korsakoff_syndrome \"Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethanol)\n  2. **Jump up ^** Rose, M.
