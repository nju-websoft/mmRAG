(See [Starship\n_Enterprise_](/wiki/Starship_Enterprise \"Starship Enterprise\") for other ships\nwith the name and/or registry). The series is set about 70 years after the\nfinal mission of the original _Enterprise_ crew under the command of [James T.\nKirk](/wiki/James_T._Kirk \"James T. Kirk\").[6] The Federation has undergone\nsignificant internal changes in its quest to explore and seek out new life,\nadding new degrees of complexity and controversy to its methods, especially\nthose focused on the [Prime Directive](/wiki/Prime_Directive \"Prime\nDirective\"). The [Klingon Empire](/wiki/Klingon \"Klingon\") and the [United\nFederation of Planets](/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets \"United Federation\nof Planets\") have ceased wartime hostilities and become galactic allies, while\nmore sinister foes such as the [Romulans](/wiki/Romulan \"Romulan\") and the\n[Borg](/wiki/Borg_\\(Star_Trek\\) \"Borg \\(Star Trek\\)\") take precedence on the\nseries.\n\nThe _Enterprise_ is commanded by Captain [Jean-Luc Picard](/wiki/Jean-\nLuc_Picard \"Jean-Luc Picard\") and is staffed by first officer Commander\n[William Riker](/wiki/William_Riker \"William Riker\"), second\nofficer/operations manager [Data](/wiki/Data_\\(Star_Trek\\) \"Data \\(Star\nTrek\\)\"), security chief [Tasha Yar](/wiki/Tasha_Yar \"Tasha Yar\"), ship's\ncounselor [Deanna Troi](/wiki/Deanna_Troi \"Deanna Troi\"), [chief medical\nofficer](/wiki/Chief_medical_officer \"Chief medical officer\") Dr. [Beverly\nCrusher](/wiki/Beverly_Crusher \"Beverly Crusher\") and her son [Wesley\nCrusher](/wiki/Wesley_Crusher \"Wesley Crusher\"), conn officer Lieutenant\n[Geordi La Forge](/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge \"Geordi La Forge\"), and junior officer\nLieutenant [Worf](/wiki/Worf \"Worf\"). The death of Lieutenant Yar in the\ntwenty-third episode of the first season (1987-1988) of the series prompts an\ninternal shuffle of personnel, making Worf official chief of security. In\nseason two, La Forge is promoted to chief engineer and [Katherine\nPulaski](/wiki/Katherine_Pulaski \"Katherine Pulaski\") briefly takes over for\nBeverly Crusher.\n\nThe series begins with the crew of the _Enterprise_ -D put on trial by an\nomnipotent being known as [Q](/wiki/Q_\\(Star_Trek\\) \"Q \\(Star Trek\\)\"), who\nbecame a recurring character. The god-like entity threatens the extinction of\nmankind for being a race of savages, forcing them to solve a mystery at nearby\nFarpoint Station to prove their worthiness to be spared. After successfully\nsolving the mystery and avoiding disaster, the crew officially departs on its\nmission to explore strange new worlds.\n\nSubsequent stories focus on the discovery of new life and sociological and\npolitical relationships with alien cultures, as well as exploring the [human\ncondition](/wiki/Human_condition \"Human condition\"). Several new species are\nintroduced as recurring antagonists, including the [Ferengi](/wiki/Ferengi\n\"Ferengi\"), the [Cardassians](/wiki/Cardassian \"Cardassian\"), and the\n[Borg](/wiki/Borg_\\(Star_Trek\\) \"Borg \\(Star Trek\\)\"). Throughout their\nadventures, Picard and his crew are often forced to face and live with the\nconsequences of difficult choices.\n\nThe series ended in its seventh season with a two-part episode \"All Good\nThings...\", which brought the events of the series full circle to the original\nconfrontation with Q. An interstellar anomaly that threatens all life in the\nuniverse forces Picard to leap from his present, past, and future to combat\nthe threat. Picard was successfully able to show to Q that humanity could\nthink outside of the confines of perception and theorize on new possibilities\nwhile still being prepared to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the greater\ngood. The series ended with the crew of the _Enterprise_ portrayed as feeling\nmore like a family and paved the way for four consecutive motion pictures that\ncontinued the theme and mission of the series.\n\nEpisodes by Season (1-4) Season 1 | Season 2 | Season 3 | Season 4  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n  1. \"[Encounter at Farpoint](/wiki/Encounter_at_Farpoint \"Encounter at Farpoint\")\"

Chairman [Frank Mancuso\nSr.](/wiki/Frank_Mancuso_Sr. \"Frank Mancuso Sr.\") and others described it as\nthe studio's \"crown jewel\", a \"priceless asset\" that \"must not be squandered\".\nThe series was the most popular [syndicated](/wiki/Broadcast_syndication\n\"Broadcast syndication\") television program 17 years after cancellation,[8]\nand the [Harve Bennett](/wiki/Harve_Bennett \"Harve Bennett\")-produced [_Star\nTrek_ films](/wiki/Star_Trek_\\(film_franchise\\) \"Star Trek \\(film\nfranchise\\)\") did well at the box office.[9] [William\nShatner](/wiki/William_Shatner \"William Shatner\") and [Leonard\nNimoy](/wiki/Leonard_Nimoy \"Leonard Nimoy\")'s salary demands for _[Star Trek\nIV: The Voyage Home](/wiki/Star_Trek_IV:_The_Voyage_Home \"Star Trek IV: The\nVoyage Home\")_ (1986) caused the studio to plan for a new _Star Trek_\ntelevision series, as it had thought to do in 1977 with _[Star Trek: Phase\nII](/wiki/Star_Trek:_Phase_II \"Star Trek: Phase II\")_ before making the films.\nParamount executives worried that a new show could hurt the demand for the\nfilms, but decided that it would increase their appeal on videocassette and\ncable,[8] and that a show with unknown actors would be more profitable than\npaying the films' actors' large salaries.[10] Roddenberry initially declined\nto be involved, but came on board as creator after being unhappy with early\nconceptual work. _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ was announced on October 10,\n1986,[6] and its cast in May 1987.[11]\n\nParamount executive Rick Berman was assigned to the show at Roddenberry's\nrequest. Roddenberry hired a number of _Star Trek_ veterans, including [Bob\nJustman](/wiki/Robert_H._Justman \"Robert H. Justman\"), [D. C.\nFontana](/wiki/D._C._Fontana \"D. C. Fontana\"), Eddie Milkis, and [David\nGerrold](/wiki/David_Gerrold \"David Gerrold\").[12] Early proposals for the\nseries included one in which some of the original series cast might appear as\n\"elder statesmen\",[8] and Roddenberry speculated as late as October 1986 that\nthe new series might not even use a spaceship, as \"people might travel by some\n[other] means\" 100 years after the [USS  _Enterprise_\n(NCC-1701)](/wiki/USS_Enterprise_\\(NCC-1701\\) \"USS Enterprise\n\\(NCC-1701\\)\").[13] A more lasting change was his new belief that workplace\ninterpersonal conflict would no longer exist in the future; thus, the new\nseries did not have parallels to the frequent \"crusty banter\" between Kirk,\n[Spock](/wiki/Spock \"Spock\"), and [Leonard McCoy](/wiki/Leonard_McCoy \"Leonard\nMcCoy\").[10] According to series actor Patrick Stewart, Berman was more\nreceptive than Roddenberry to the show addressing political issues.[14]\n\nThe series' music theme combined the fanfare from the original series theme by\n[Alexander Courage](/wiki/Alexander_Courage \"Alexander Courage\") with [Jerry\nGoldsmith](/wiki/Jerry_Goldsmith \"Jerry Goldsmith\")'s theme for _[Star Trek:\nThe Motion Picture](/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Motion_Picture \"Star Trek: The Motion\nPicture\")_ (1979). Some early episodes' plots derived from outlines created\nfor _Star Trek: Phase II_.[6] Additionally, some sets used in the _Original\nSeries_ -era films were redressed for _The Next Generation_ , and in turn used\nfor subsequent _Original Series_ films.[15] Part of the transporter room set\nin _TNG_ was used in the original _Star Trek_ 's transporter set.[15] Many\nproduction details, such as [LCARS](/wiki/LCARS \"LCARS\") computer interfaces\nand starship design, were carried through in the production of subsequent\nspin-offs.\n\nA major focus of the show is the faster-than-light starship visiting\n[exoplanets](/wiki/Exoplanet \"Exoplanet\"), which, although some had speculated\nto exist, were still in the realm of science fiction when show started in the\n1987. However, by the early 1990s more claims were coming out including for\n[PSR B1257+12](/wiki/PSR_B1257%2B12 \"PSR B1257+12\"), and a year after the show\nended there was a more definitive detection of planets around [51\nPegasi](/wiki/51_Pegasi \"51 Pegasi\"). Another example is the ubiquitous use of\nhand-held tablet computers, at the time a fictional technology props for the\nactors but became a more practical and common computing device by the 2010s\n\n### Syndication and\nprofitability[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Syndication and profitability\")]\n\nDespite _Star Trek_ 's proven success, NBC and ABC only offered to consider\npilot scripts for the new series, and CBS offered to air a [miniseries that\ncould become a series](/wiki/Backdoor_pilot \"Backdoor pilot\") if it did well.\nThat the [Big Three television networks](/wiki/Big_Three_television_networks\n\"Big Three television networks\") treated Paramount's most appealing and\nvaluable property as they would any other series offended the studio.\n[Fox](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting Company\") wanted the\nshow to help launch the new network, but wanted it by March 1987, and would\nonly commit to 13 episodes instead of a full season. The unsuccessful\nnegotiations convinced the studio that it could only protect _Star Trek_ with\nfull control.[8][13]\n\nParamount increased and accelerated the show's profitability by choosing to\ninstead broadcast it in [first-run syndication](/wiki/First-run_syndication\n\"First-run syndication\")[16][10][17]:123–124 on [independent\nstations](/wiki/Independent_station_\\(North_America\\) \"Independent station\n\\(North America\\)\") (whose numbers had more than tripled since 1980) and Big\nThree [network affiliates](/wiki/Network_affiliate \"Network affiliate\").[8]\nThe studio offered the show to local stations for free as [barter\nsyndication](/wiki/Barter_syndication \"Barter syndication\"). The stations sold\nfive minutes of commercial time to local advertisers and Paramount sold the\nremaining seven minutes to national advertisers. Stations had to commit to\npurchasing reruns in the future,[16] and only those that aired the new show\ncould purchase the popular reruns of the original series.[18]:222[19]\n\nThe studio's strategy succeeded. Most of the 150 stations airing reruns of the\noriginal _Star Trek_ wanted to prevent a competitor from airing the new show;\nultimately, 210 stations covering 90% of the United States became part of\nParamount's informal nationwide network for _TNG_.[16][20] In early October\n1987, more than 50 network affiliates pre-empted their own shows for the\nseries pilot, \"[Encounter at Farpoint](/wiki/Encounter_at_Farpoint \"Encounter\nat Farpoint\")\". One station predicted that \"'Star Trek' promises to be one of\nthe most successful programs of the season, network or syndicated.\"[20] TNG\nhelped stations like [WZZM](/wiki/WZZM \"WZZM\") in [Grand Rapids,\nMichigan](/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan \"Grand Rapids, Michigan\"), who made a\ndecision show _The Next Generation_.[20]\n\nThe new show indeed performed well; the pilot's ratings were higher than those\nof many network programs,[20] and ratings remained comparable to network shows\nby the end of the first season, despite the handicap of each station airing\nthe show on a different day and time, often outside prime time. By the end of\nthe first season, Paramount reportedly received $1 million for advertising per\nepisode, more than the roughly $800,000 fee that networks typically paid for a\none-hour show;[16] by 1992, when the budget for each episode had risen to\nalmost $2 million,[21] the studio earned $90 million from advertising annually\nfrom first-run episodes, with each 30-second commercial selling for $115,000\nto $150,000.[22][23] The show had a 40% [return on\ninvestment](/wiki/Return_on_investment \"Return on investment\") for Paramount,\nwith $30 to $60 million in annual upfront net profit for first-run episodes\nand another $70 million for [stripping](/wiki/Stripping_\\(television\\)\n\"Stripping \\(television\\)\") rights for each of the about 100 episodes then\navailable, so did not need overseas sales to be successful.[22]\n\n### Season\none[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Season one\")]\n\nMain article: [Star Trek: The Next Generation (season\n1)](/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_\\(season_1\\) \"Star Trek: The Next\nGeneration \\(season 1\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Gates_with_Denise_August_2017.jpg/220px-\nGates_with_Denise_August_2017.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gates_with_Denise_August_2017.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gates_with_Denise_August_2017.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGates and Denise were in Season 1 as Doctor Crusher and Tasha Yar,\nrespectively, but were removed for Season 2.\n\n_The Next Generation_ was shot on 35mm film,[24] and the budget for each\nepisode was $1.3 million, among the largest for a one-hour television\ndrama.[16] While the staff enjoyed the creative freedom gained by independence\nfrom a broadcast network's [Standards and\nPractices](/wiki/Standards_and_Practices \"Standards and Practices\")\ndepartment,[18]:222 the first season was marked by a \"revolving door\" of\nwriters, with Gerrold, [Fontana](/wiki/D._C._Fontana \"D.

Fontana\"), and\nothers quitting after disputes with Roddenberry.[25] Roddenberry \"virtually\nrewrote\" the first 15 episodes because of his \"dogmatic\" intention to depict\nhuman interaction \"without drawing on the baser motives of greed, lust, and\npower\". Writers found the show's \"[bible](/wiki/Bible_\\(writing\\) \"Bible\n\\(writing\\)\")\" constricting and ridiculous and couldn't deal with\nRoddenberry's ego and treatment of them. It stated, for example, that \"regular\ncharacters all share a feeling of being part of a band of brothers and\nsisters. As in the original 'Star Trek,' we invite the audience to share the\nsame feeling of affection for our characters.\"[10]\n\nMark Bourne of _The DVD Journal_ wrote of season one: \"A typical episode\nrelied on trite plot points, clumsy allegories, dry and stilted dialogue, or\ncharacterization that was taking too long to feel relaxed and natural.\"[26]\nOther targets of criticism included poor [special\neffects](/wiki/Special_effect \"Special effect\") and plots being resolved by\nthe _[deus ex machina](/wiki/Deus_ex_machina \"Deus ex machina\")_ of [Wesley\nCrusher](/wiki/Wesley_Crusher \"Wesley Crusher\") saving the ship.[27][28]\nHowever, [Patrick Stewart](/wiki/Patrick_Stewart \"Patrick Stewart\")'s acting\nskills won praise, and critics noted that characters were given greater\npotential for development than those of the original series.[26][27] Both\nactors and producers were unsure whether [Trekkies](/wiki/Trekkie \"Trekkie\")\nloyal to the original show would accept the new one,[29][30] but one critic\nstated as early as October 1987 that _The Next Generation_ , not the movies or\nthe original show, \"is the real 'Star Trek' now\".[31]\n\nWhile the events of most episodes of season one were self-contained, many\ndevelopments important to the show as a whole occurred during the season. The\nrecurring nemesis [Q](/wiki/Q_\\(Star_Trek\\) \"Q \\(Star Trek\\)\") was introduced\nin the pilot, the alien Ferengi had their sentinel showing in \"[The Last\nOutpost](/wiki/The_Last_Outpost_\\(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\\) \"The Last\nOutpost \\(Star Trek: The Next Generation\\)\")\", the [holodeck](/wiki/Holodeck\n\"Holodeck\") was introduced, and the romantic backstory between [William\nRiker](/wiki/William_Riker \"William Riker\") and [Deanna\nTroi](/wiki/Deanna_Troi \"Deanna Troi\") was investigated. \"[The Naked\nNow](/wiki/The_Naked_Now \"The Naked Now\")\", one of the few episodes that\ndepicted Roddenberry's fascination (as seen in the show's bible) with sex in\nthe future, became a cast favorite.[10]\n\nLater episodes in the season set the stage for serial plots. The episode\n\"[Datalore](/wiki/Datalore \"Datalore\")\" introduced Data's [evil\ntwin](/wiki/Evil_twin \"Evil twin\") brother [Lore](/wiki/Lore_\\(Star_Trek\\)\n\"Lore \\(Star Trek\\)\"), who made several more appearances in episodes in\nsubsequent seasons. \"[Coming of\nAge](/wiki/Coming_of_Age_\\(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\\) \"Coming of Age\n\\(Star Trek: The Next Generation\\)\")\" dealt with Wesley Crusher's efforts to\nget into [Starfleet Academy](/wiki/Starfleet_Academy \"Starfleet Academy\")\nwhile also hinting at the threat to Starfleet later faced in\n\"[Conspiracy](/wiki/Conspiracy_\\(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\\) \"Conspiracy\n\\(Star Trek: The Next Generation\\)\")\". \"[Heart of Glory](/wiki/Heart_of_Glory\n\"Heart of Glory\")\" explored Worf's character, [Klingon](/wiki/Klingon\n\"Klingon\") culture, and the uneasy truce between the Federation and the\nKlingon Empire, three themes that played major roles in later episodes. Tasha\nYar left the show in \"[Skin of Evil](/wiki/Skin_of_Evil \"Skin of Evil\")\",\nbecoming the first regular Star Trek character to die permanently (although\nthe character was seen again in two later episodes) in either series or film.\nThe season finale, \"[The Neutral\nZone](/wiki/The_Neutral_Zone_\\(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\\) \"The Neutral\nZone \\(Star Trek: The Next Generation\\)\")\", established the presence of two of\n_TNG_ ' most enduring villains: the Romulans, making their first appearance\nsince the _Original Series_ , and, through foreshadowing, the Borg.\n\nThe premiere became the first television episode to be nominated for a [Hugo\nAward](/wiki/Hugo_Award \"Hugo Award\") since 1972.

Another change was in the opening theme, wherein at the end is a short\nfanfare. Owing to the [1988 Writers Guild of America\nstrike](/wiki/1988_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike \"1988 Writers Guild of\nAmerica strike\"), the number of episodes produced was cut from 26 to 22, and\nthe start of the season was delayed. Because of the strike, the opening\nepisode, \"[The Child](/wiki/The_Child_\\(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\\) \"The\nChild \\(Star Trek: The Next Generation\\)\")\", was based on a script originally\nwritten for _[Star Trek: Phase II](/wiki/Star_Trek:_Phase_II \"Star Trek: Phase\nII\")_ , while the season finale, \"[Shades of\nGray](/wiki/Shades_of_Gray_\\(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\\) \"Shades of Gray\n\\(Star Trek: The Next Generation\\)\")\", was a [clip show](/wiki/Clip_show \"Clip\nshow\").\n\nNevertheless, season two as a whole was widely regarded as significantly\nbetter than season one.[33] Benefiting from Paramount's commitment to a\nmultiyear run and free from network interference due to syndication,\nRoddenberry found writers who could work within his guidelines and create\ndrama from the cast's interaction with the rest of the universe.[10] The plots\nbecame more sophisticated and began to mix drama with comic relief. Its focus\non character development received special praise.[33] Co-executive producer\nMaurice Hurley has stated that his primary goal for the season was to plan and\nexecute season-long [story arcs](/wiki/Story_arc \"Story arc\") and [character\narcs](/wiki/Character_arc \"Character arc\").[34] Hurley wrote the acclaimed\nepisode \"[Q Who](/wiki/Q_Who \"Q Who\")\", which featured the first on-screen\nappearance of the Borg, _TNG_ 's most popular villain. Season two focused on\ndeveloping the character Data, and two highly regarded episodes from the\nseason, \"[Elementary, Dear Data](/wiki/Elementary,_Dear_Data \"Elementary, Dear\nData\")\" and \"[The Measure of a\nMan](/wiki/The_Measure_of_a_Man_\\(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\\) \"The\nMeasure of a Man \\(Star Trek: The Next Generation\\)\")\", featured him\nprominently.[35] [Miles O'Brien](/wiki/Miles_O%27Brien_\\(Star_Trek\\) \"Miles\nO'Brien \\(Star Trek\\)\") also became a more prominent character during the\nsecond season, while [Geordi La Forge](/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge \"Geordi La\nForge\") took the position of Chief Engineer. Klingon issues continued to be\nexplored in well-regarded episodes such as \"[A Matter of\nHonor](/wiki/A_Matter_of_Honor \"A Matter of Honor\")\" and \"[The\nEmissary](/wiki/The_Emissary_\\(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\\) \"The Emissary\n\\(Star Trek: The Next Generation\\)\")\", which introduced Worf's former lover\n[K'Ehleyr](/wiki/K%27Ehleyr \"K'Ehleyr\").[36] Five second-season episodes were\nnominated for six Emmy Awards, and \"Q Who\" won for Outstanding Sound Editing\nfor a Series and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series.[6]\n\n_Debuted 1988-1989_\n\n### Season\nthree[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Season three\")]\n\nMain article: [Star Trek: The Next Generation (season\n3)](/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_\\(season_3\\) \"Star Trek: The Next\nGeneration \\(season 3\\)\")\n\nBefore the production of the third season in the summer of 1989, some\npersonnel changes were made. Head writer Maurice Hurley was let go and\n[Michael Piller](/wiki/Michael_Piller \"Michael Piller\") took over for the rest\nof the series. Creator and executive producer Gene Roddenberry took less of an\nactive role due to his declining health. Roddenberry gave Piller and Berman\nthe executive producer jobs, and they remained in that position for the rest\nof the series' run, with Berman overseeing the production as a whole and\nPiller being in charge of the creative direction of the show and the writing\nroom. Doctor Crusher returned from her off-screen tenure at Starfleet Medical\nto replace Doctor Pulaski, who had remained a guest star throughout the second\nseason. An additional change was the inclusion of the fanfare that was added\nto the opening credits of the second season, to the end of the closing\ncredits. [Ronald D. Moore](/wiki/Ronald_D._Moore \"Ronald D.

The Riker character was influenced by concepts for first officer Willard Decker in the _[Star Trek: Phase II](/wiki/Star_Trek:_Phase_II \"Star Trek: Phase II\")_ television series.[6] Decker's romantic history with helmsman Ilia was mirrored in _The Next Generation_ in the relationship between Riker and Deanna Troi.[6] Riker also appears in an episode each of _[Star Trek: Voyager](/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager \"Star Trek: Voyager\")_ and _[Star Trek: Enterprise](/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise \"Star Trek: Enterprise\")_. In addition to William Riker, Frakes played William's [transporter](/wiki/Transporter_\\(Star_Trek\\) \"Transporter \\(Star Trek\\)\")-created double, Thomas, in one episode each of _The Next Generation_ and _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_.\n  * [LeVar Burton](/wiki/LeVar_Burton \"LeVar Burton\") as [Geordi La Forge](/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge \"Geordi La Forge\") was initially the ship's helmsman, but the character became chief engineer beginning in the second season. Burton also played the character in an episode of _Voyager_.\n  * [Denise Crosby](/wiki/Denise_Crosby \"Denise Crosby\") as [Tasha Yar](/wiki/Tasha_Yar \"Tasha Yar\") is the chief of security and tactical officer. Crosby left the series at the end of the first season, and the Yar character was killed. Yar returns in alternate timelines in the award-winning episode \"[Yesterday's Enterprise](/wiki/Yesterday%27s_Enterprise \"Yesterday's Enterprise\")\" and the series finale, \"[All Good Things...](/wiki/All_Good_Things..._\\(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\\) \"All Good Things... \\(Star Trek: The Next Generation\\)\")\". Crosby also played Commander Sela, Yar's half-[Romulan](/wiki/Romulan \"Romulan\") daughter.\n  * [Michael Dorn](/wiki/Michael_Dorn \"Michael Dorn\") as [Worf](/wiki/Worf \"Worf\") is a Klingon. Worf initially appears as a junior officer fulfilling several roles on the bridge. When Denise Crosby left at the end of the first season, the Worf character succeeded Lieutenant Yar as the ship's chief of security and tactical officer. Dorn reprised the role as a regular in seasons four through seven of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ and also played another Klingon, also named Worf, in _[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country](/wiki/Star_Trek_VI:_The_Undiscovered_Country \"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\")_ ; with 282 on screen appearances, Dorn has the most appearances of any actor in the _Star Trek_ franchise.[50]\n  * [Gates McFadden](/wiki/Gates_McFadden \"Gates McFadden\") as Doctor [Beverly Crusher](/wiki/Beverly_Crusher \"Beverly Crusher\") is the _Enterprise_ 's chief medical officer. As a fully certified bridge officer, Dr. Crusher had the ability to command the _Enterprise_ , if circumstances required her to do so. She also, on occasional, commanded night-watch shifts on the ship's main bridge to stay on top of starship operations. McFadden was fired after the first season, but was rehired for the third season[51] and remained for the remainder of the series.\n  * [Diana Muldaur](/wiki/Diana_Muldaur \"Diana Muldaur\") as Doctor [Katherine Pulaski](/wiki/Katherine_Pulaski \"Katherine Pulaski\") was created to replace Dr. Crusher for the show's second season. Muldaur, who previously appeared in two episodes of the original _Star Trek_ , never received billing in the opening credits; instead, she was listed as a special guest star during the first act.\n  * [Marina Sirtis](/wiki/Marina_Sirtis \"Marina Sirtis\") as Lieutenant Commander [Deanna Troi](/wiki/Deanna_Troi \"Deanna Troi\") is the half-human, half-[Betazoid](/wiki/Betazoid \"Betazoid\") ship's counselor. Starting in the season-seven7 episode \"Thine Own Self\", Counselor Troi, having taken and completed the bridge-officer's test, is later promoted to the rank of commander, which allowed her to take command of the ship, and also perform bridge duties other than those of a ship's counselor. The character's relationship with first officer Riker was a carry-over from character ideas developed for _Phase II_.[6] Troi also appeared in later episodes of _Voyager_ and in the finale of _Enterprise_.\n  * [Brent Spiner](/wiki/Brent_Spiner \"Brent Spiner\") as Lieutenant Commander [Data](/wiki/Data_\\(Star_Trek\\) \"Data \\(Star Trek\\)\") is an [android](/wiki/Android_\\(robot\\) \"Android \\(robot\\)\") who serves as second officer and operations officer.

She also voiced the computer in _The Next Generation_ and other spinoffs.\n  * [Brian Bonsall](/wiki/Brian_Bonsall \"Brian Bonsall\") as [Alexander Rozhenko](/wiki/Alexander_Rozhenko \"Alexander Rozhenko\") is Worf's son. [Jon Paul Steuer](/wiki/Jon_Paul_Steuer \"Jon Paul Steuer\") played Alexander in the character's first appearance, and [James Sloyan](/wiki/James_Sloyan \"James Sloyan\") played an older, time-traveling version of Alexander in another episode.

That same season, however, she resigns from Starfleet to become a member of a group of renegade federation colonists known as \"the Maquis\". Forbes' character was considered for use in _Deep Space Nine_ , although producers eventually developed a new character, [Kira Nerys](/wiki/Kira_Nerys \"Kira Nerys\").[52]\n  * [Colm Meaney](/wiki/Colm_Meaney \"Colm Meaney\") as [Miles O'Brien](/wiki/Miles_O%27Brien_\\(Star_Trek\\) \"Miles O'Brien \\(Star Trek\\)\") is an unnamed helmsman in the show's pilot, and appears several times in other positions during the first season. The character was eventually given a rank of Chief Petty Officer, and developed into the transporter chief. Meaney portrayed O'Brien for seven seasons as a series regular on _Deep Space Nine_.\n  * [Robert O'Reilly](/wiki/Robert_O%27Reilly \"Robert O'Reilly\") as [Gowron](/wiki/Gowron \"Gowron\") is leader of the [Klingon High Council](/wiki/Klingon_High_Council \"Klingon High Council\"). O'Reilly also appeared as Gowron in _Deep Space Nine_. O'Reilly appeared in an episode of _Enterprise_ as a different character.\n  * [Dwight Schultz](/wiki/Dwight_Schultz \"Dwight Schultz\") as Lieutenant [Reginald Barclay](/wiki/Reginald_Barclay \"Reginald Barclay\") is a technician and engineer who also plays a prominent role in the later seasons of _Voyager_.\n  * [Patti Yasutake](/wiki/Patti_Yasutake \"Patti Yasutake\") as Ensign [Alyssa Ogawa](/wiki/Alyssa_Ogawa \"Alyssa Ogawa\") is a nurse in Dr. Crusher's sickbay.\n\nThere were certain big changes for regular characters, the major one was that\nTasha Yar is only in season one, and Wesley left for Starfleet Academy in\nSeason 4. In Season 2 the doctor is Pulaski not Crusher, but Crusher does come\nback and remains the ship's doctor thereafter (In All Good Things it is\nrevealed she eventually marries Picard and has her own starship command, thus\nbecoming the new Captain Picard, as he retired to tend a vineyard). In many\ncases the characters, or at least the actors, come back to act in some role on\nthe show. There are many reoccurring characters, some of them have actually\nmore appearances in episodes than Tasha.

These could be grouped in different ways, and one way was by the aliens\nthey were interacting with, for example _TNG_ introduced the Borg and the\nCardassians. The Klingons and Romulans had been introduced in the original\nseries (1966–69); however, the Klingons were somewhat re-booted with \"turtle-\nhead\" look, although a [retcon](/wiki/Retcon \"Retcon\") was given for this in\nan _Enterprise_ episode.
