The Midday Meal\nScheme and the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme are universal in\nnature whereas the PDS will reach about two-thirds of the population (75% in\nrural areas and 50% in urban areas).\n\nUnder the provisions of the bill, beneficiaries of the [Public Distribution\nSystem](/wiki/Public_Distribution_System \"Public Distribution System\") (or,\nPDS) are entitled to 5 kilograms (11 lb) per person per month of cereals at\nthe following prices:\n\n  * [Rice](/wiki/Rice \"Rice\") at ₹3 (4.6¢ US) per kg\n  * [Wheat](/wiki/Wheat \"Wheat\") at ₹2 (3.1¢ US) per kg\n  * Coarse grains ([millet](/wiki/Millet \"Millet\")) at ₹1 (1.5¢ US) per kg.\n\nPregnant women, lactating mothers, and certain categories of children are\neligible for daily free cereals.\n\nThe bill has been highly controversial. It was introduced into India's\nparliament on 22 December 2011, promulgated as a presidential ordinance on 5\nJuly 2013, and enacted into law on 12 September 2013.[4][5]\n\nOdisha government implemented food security bill in 14 district from 17\nNovember 2015\n\nAssam government implemented Act on 24 December 2015.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Salient features\n  * 2 Intent\n  * 3 Scope\n  * 4 Commentary\n    * 4.1 Critics\n    * 4.2 Advocates\n  * 5 Chhattisgarh Food Security Act\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n    * 8.1 Official Documents\n    * 8.2 Media coverage and comments\n\n## Salient\nfeatures[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Food_Security_Act,_2013&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Salient features\")]\n\n**Coverage and entitlement under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS)\n:** Up to 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population will be\ncovered under TPDS, with uniform entitlement of 5 kg per person per month.\nHowever, since Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households constitute poorest of\nthe poor, and are presently entitled to 35 kg per household per month,\nentitlement of existing AAY households will be protected at 35 kg per\nhousehold per month. **State-wise coverage :** Corresponding to the all India\ncoverage of 75% and 50% in the rural and urban areas, State-wise coverage will\nbe determined by the Central Government. Planning Commission has determined\nthe State-wise coverage by using the NSS Household Consumption Survey data for\n2011-12......\n\n**Subsidised prices under TPDS and their revision :** Foodgrains under TPDS\nwill be made available at subsidised prices of Rs. 3/2/1 per kg for rice,\nwheat and coarse grains for a period of three years from the date of\ncommencement of the Act. Thereafter prices will be suitably linked to Minimum\nSupport Price (MSP). In case, any State’s allocation under the Act is lower\nthan their current allocation, it will be protected up to the level of average\nofftake under normal TPDS during last three years, at prices to be determined\nby the Central Government. Existing prices for APL households i.e. Rs. 6.10\nper kg for wheat and Rs 8.30 per kg for rice has been determined as issue\nprices for the additional allocation to protect the average offtake during\nlast three years.\n\n**Identification of Households :** Within the coverage under TPDS determined\nfor each State, the work of identification of eligible households is to be\ndone by States/UTs.\n\n**Nutritional Support to women and children :** Pregnant women and lactating\nmothers and children in the age group of 6 months to 14 years will be entitled\nto meals as per prescribed nutritional norms under Integrated Child\nDevelopment Services (ICDS) and Mid-Day Meal (MDM) schemes. Higher nutritional\nnorms have been prescribed for malnourished children up to 6 years of age.\n\n**Maternity Benefit :** Pregnant women and lactating mothers will also be\nentitled to receive maternity benefit of not less than Rs. 6,000.\n\n**Women Empowerment :** Eldest woman of the household of age 18 years or above\nto be the head of the household for the purpose of issuing of ration cards.\n\n**Grievance Redressal Mechanism :** Grievance redressal mechanism at the\nDistrict and State levels. States will have the flexibility to use the\nexisting machinery or set up separate mechanism.\n\n**Cost of intra-State transportation & handling of foodgrains and FPS Dealers'\nmargin :** Central Government will provide assistance to States in meeting the\nexpenditure incurred by them on transportation of foodgrains within the State,\nits handling and FPS dealers’ margin as per norms to be devised for this\npurpose.\n\n**Transparency and Accountability :** Provisions have been made for disclosure\nof records relating to PDS, social audits and setting up of Vigilance\nCommittees in order to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\n**Food Security Allowance :** Provision for food security allowance to\nentitled beneficiaries in case of non-supply of entitled foodgrains or meals.\n\n**Penalty :** Provision for penalty on public servant or authority, to be\nimposed by the State Food Commission, in case of failure to comply with the\nrelief recommended by the District Grievance Redressal Officer.[6]\n\n##\nIntent[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Food_Security_Act,_2013&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Intent\")]\n\nThe intent of the National Food Security Bill is spelled out in the [Lok\nSabha](/wiki/Lok_Sabha \"Lok Sabha\") committee report, [_The National Food\nSecurity Bill, 2011, Twenty Seventh\nReport_](http://164.100.47.134/lsscommittee/Food,%20Consumer%20Affairs%20&%20Public%20Distribution/Final%20Report%20on%20NFSB.pdf),\nwhich states, \"Food security means availability of sufficient foodgrains to\nmeet the domestic demand as well as access, at the individual level, to\nadequate quantities of food at affordable prices.\" The report adds, \"The\nproposed legislation marks a paradigm shift in addressing the problem of food\nsecurity – from the current welfare approach to a right based approach. About\ntwo thirds(approx 67%) of the population will be entitled to receive\nsubsidized foodgrains under Targeted [Public Distribution\nSystem](/wiki/Public_Distribution_System \"Public Distribution System\"). In a\ncountry where almost 40% of children are undernourished the importance of the\nscheme increases significantly.\"\n\n##\nScope[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Food_Security_Act,_2013&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Scope\")]\n\nThe Indian Ministry of Agriculture's Commission on Agricultural Costs and\nPrices (CACP) has referred to the Bill as the \"biggest ever experiment in the\nworld for distributing highly subsidized food by any government through a\n‘rights based’ approach.\"[7] The Bill extends coverage of the Targeted Public\nDistribution System, India's principal domestic food aid program, to two\nthirds of the population, or approximately 820 million people. Initially, the\nLok Sabha Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution\nestimated a \"total requirement of foodgrains, as per the Bill would be 61.55\nmillion [metric] tons in 2012-13.\"[8] The CACP calculated in May 2013, \"...the\nrequirement for average monthly [PDS](/wiki/Public_Distribution_System \"Public\nDistribution System\") offtake is calculated as 2.3 mt for wheat (27.6 mt\nannually) and 2.8 mt for rice (33.6 mt annually)...\" When volumes needed for\nthe Public Distribution System and \"Other Welfare Schemes\" were aggregated,\nthe CACP estimated rice and wheat requirements to total an \"annual requirement\nof 61.2\" million metric tons.[7] However, the final version of the Bill signed\ninto law includes on page 18 an annex, \"Schedule IV\", which estimates the\ntotal food grain allocation as 54.926 million metric tons.[9]\n\nThe Standing Committee estimated that the value of additional food subsidies\n(i.e., on top of the existing Public Distribution System) \"during 2012-13\nworks out to be...Rs.2409 [crores](/wiki/Crore \"Crore\"),\" that is, 24.09\nbillion rupees, or about $446 million at the then-current exchange rate, for a\ntotal expenditure of 1.122 trillion rupees (or between $20 and $21\nbillion).[8] However, the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP)\ncalculated, \"Currently, the economic cost of\n[FCI](/wiki/Food_Corporation_of_India \"Food Corporation of India\") for\nacquiring, storing and distributing foodgrains is about 40 percent more than\nthe procurement price.\"[10] The Commission added,\n\n    The stated expenditure of Rs 1,20,000 crore annually in NFSB is merely the tip of the iceberg. To support the system and the welfare schemes, additional expenditure is needed for the envisaged administrative set up, scaling up of operations, enhancement of production, investments for storage, movement, processing and market infrastructure etc. The existing Food Security Complex of Procurement, Stocking and Distribution- which NFSB perpetuates- would increase the operational expenditure of the Scheme given its creaking infrastructure, leakages & inefficient governance.[10]\n\nThe Commission concluded that the total bill for implementation of the Bill\n\"....may touch an expenditure of anywhere between Rs 125,000 to 150,000\ncrores,\" i.e., 1.25 to 1.5 trillion rupees.[10] As of the implementation\ndeadline of 4 October 2014, only 11 states had either implemented the Act or\ndeclared readiness to do so.[11] On 28 November 2014, the Indian government\nannounced, \"Allocation of foodgrains to 11 States/Union Territories (UTs)\nnamely, Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,\nKarnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Rajasthan has started under\nthe Act...\" and that the \"remaining 25 States/UTs have not completed the\npreparatory measures required for implementation of the Act.\" The Indian\ngovernment extended the deadline for implementation of the Act \"by another six\nmonths, i.e. till 04.04.2015.\"[12]\n\n##\nCommentary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Food_Security_Act,_2013&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Commentary\")]\n\n###\nCritics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Food_Security_Act,_2013&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Critics\")]\n\nCriticism of the National Food Security Bill includes accusations of both\npolitical motivation and fiscal irresponsibility.[13][14][15][16] One senior\nopposition politician, [Murli Manohar Joshi](/wiki/Murli_Manohar_Joshi \"Murli\nManohar Joshi\"), went so far as to describe the bill as a measure for \"vote\nsecurity\" (for the ruling government coalition) rather than food security.[13]\nAnother political figure, [Mulayam Singh\nYadav](http://www.samajwadipartyindia.com/national_president.php), declared,\n\"It is clearly being brought for elections...Why didn’t you bring this bill\nearlier when poor people were dying because of hunger?...Every election, you\nbring up a measure. There is nothing for the poor.\"[17]\n\nThe report of the 33rd meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary\nPolicy stated, \"...Food prices are still elevated and the food security bill\nwill aggravate food price inflation as it will tilt supply towards\n[cereals](/wiki/Cereal \"Cereal\") and away from other farm produce\n([proteins](/wiki/Protein \"Protein\")), which will raise food prices\nfurther...Members desired that the Reserve Bank impress on the government the\nneed to address supply side constraints which are causing inflationary\npressure, especially on the food front.\"[18][19] Dr. [Surjit S.\nBhalla](http://www.gatewayhouse.in/author/surjit-bhalla/) warned, \"The food\nsecurity bill...if implemented honestly, will cost 3 per cent of the GDP in\nits very first year.\"[20] The writer Vivek Kaul noted,\n\n    The government’s estimated cost of food security comes at 11.10%...of the total receipts. The CACP’s estimated cost of food security comes at 21.5%...of the total receipts. Bhalla’s cost of food security comes at around 28% of the total receipts...Once we express the cost of food security as a percentage of the total estimated receipts of the government, during the current financial year, we see how huge the cost of food security really is.[21]\n\nThe Indian Ministry of Agriculture's Commission on Agricultural Costs and\nPrices warned that enactment of the Bill could be expected to \"induce severe\nimbalance in the production of oilseeds and pulses,\" and \"...will create\ndemand pressures, which will inevitably spillover to market prices of food\ngrains. Furthermore, the higher food subsidy burden on the budget will raise\nthe fiscal deficit, exacerbating macro level inflationary pressures.\"[10] The\nCommission argued further that the Bill would restrict private initiative in\nagriculture, reduce competition in the marketplace due to government\ndomination of the grain market, shift money from investments in agriculture to\nsubsidies, and continue focus on cereals production when shifts in consumer\ndemand patterns indicate a need to focus more on protein, fruits and\nvegetables.[10]\n\n###\nAdvocates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Food_Security_Act,_2013&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Advocates\")]\n\nThe bill was very widely viewed as a \"pet project\" of [Indian National\nCongress](/wiki/Indian_National_Congress \"Indian National Congress\")(INC)\nPresident, [Sonia Gandhi](/wiki/Sonia_Gandhi \"Sonia Gandhi\").[22][23] Gandhi\naddressed Parliament the night of the August 2013 [Lok Sabha](/wiki/Lok_Sabha\n\"Lok Sabha\") vote on the bill, saying its passage would be a \"chance to make\nhistory\".[24]\n\nFormer [National Advisory Council](/wiki/National_Advisory_Council \"National\nAdvisory Council\") member and development economist Professor [Jean\nDrèze](/wiki/Jean_Dr%C3%A8ze \"Jean Drèze\"), reputedly one of the architects of\nthe original, 2011 version of the bill, wrote, \"...the Bill is a form of\ninvestment in human capital. It will bring some security in people’s lives and\nmake it easier for them to meet their basic needs, protect their health,\neducate their children, and take risks.\"[25] Professor Drèze dismissed\nopposition from business interests, saying, \"Corporate hostility does not tell\nus anything except that the Food Bill does not serve corporate interests.\nNobody is claiming that it does, nor is that the purpose of the Bill.\"[26]\n\nMinister of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution [K.V.\nThomas](/wiki/K.V._Thomas \"K.V. Thomas\") stated in an interview,\n\n    This is no mean task, a task being accomplished in the second most populated country in the world. All the while, it has been a satisfying journey. The responsibility is not just of the Central Government but equally of the States/[Union Territories]. I am sure together we can fulfill this dream. The day is not far off, when India will be known the world over for this important step towards eradication of hunger, malnutrition and resultant poverty...By providing food security to 75 percent of the rural and 50 percent of the urban population with focus on nutritional needs of children, pregnant and lactating women, the National Food Security Bill will revolutionize food distribution system.[4]\n\nIn a rebuttal to Dr. Surjit S. Bhalla, three economists responded, \"...the\nfood subsidy bill should roughly double and come to around 1.35% of GDP, which\nis still way less than the numbers he put out.\"[27]\n\n## Chhattisgarh Food Security\nAct[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Food_Security_Act,_2013&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Chhattisgarh Food Security Act\")]\n\nThe **[Chhattisgarh Food Security Act,\n2012](/wiki/National_Food_Security_Act,_2013#Chhattisgarh_Food_Security_Act\n\"National Food Security Act, 2013\")** law was enacted by the\n[Chhattisgarh](/wiki/Chhattisgarh \"Chhattisgarh\") government. It was passed on\n21 December 2012, by the State Assembly unopposed to ensure \"access to\nadequate quantity of food and other requirements of good nutrition to the\npeople of the State, at affordable prices, at all times to live a life of\ndignity.’’.[28]\n\nThe Act divides households into four groups — Antodaya, Priority, General and\nExcluded households.\n\nThe priority households will have monthly public distribution system (PDS)\nentitlement of 35 kg rice, wheat flour, pulses, gram and iodised salt at\nsubsidised price. \"The new act will make the acclaimed PDS more comprehensive.\nNearly 90% of the provisions incorporated in the Act were already covered\nunder the PDS\", the chief minister [Raman Singh](/wiki/Raman_Singh \"Raman\nSingh\") said.The new initiative will put a burden of Rs. 2311 crore on the\nstate exchequer. The act will not cover those who are income tax payees, own\nover 4 hectares of irrigated or 8 hectares of non-irrigated land in non-\nscheduled areas and who are liable to pay property tax in urban areas.[29]\n\nThe Act benefits 42 lakh families living here. It will also cover families\nheaded by a destitute, a widow or a differently abled person. It will also\ntake care of poor, children living in hostels/ashrams, pregnant women as well\nas those hit by disaster.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Food_Security_Act,_2013&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Right to food](/wiki/Right_to_food \"Right to food\")\n  * [Public distribution system](/wiki/Public_distribution_system \"Public distribution system\")\n  * [Food Security Bill](/wiki/Food_Security_Bill \"Food Security Bill\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Food_Security_Act,_2013&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Govt defers promulgation of ordinance on Food Security Bill\"](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Govt-defers-promulgation-of-ordinance-on-Food-Security-Bill/articleshow/20569710.cms).
