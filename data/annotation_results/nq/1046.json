        "# Control unit\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\nThis article is about the component of a computer's CPU. For other uses, see\n[Control unit (disambiguation)](/wiki/Control_unit_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Control\nunit \\(disambiguation\\)\").\n\nThe **control unit** (CU) is a component of a computer's [central processing\nunit](/wiki/Central_processing_unit \"Central processing unit\") (CPU) that\ndirects the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory,\narithmetic/logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to the\ninstructions that have been sent to the processor.[1]\n\nIt directs the operation of the other units by providing timing and control\nsignals. Most computer resources are managed by the CU. It directs the flow of\ndata between the CPU and the other devices. [John von\nNeumann](/wiki/John_von_Neumann \"John von Neumann\") included the control unit\nas part of the [von Neumann architecture](/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture \"Von\nNeumann architecture\").[2] In modern computer designs, the control unit is\ntypically an internal part of the [CPU](/wiki/Central_processing_unit \"Central\nprocessing unit\") with its overall role and operation unchanged since its\nintroduction.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Functions of the control unit\n  * 2 Hardwired control unit\n  * 3 Microprogram control unit\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n## Functions of the control\nunit[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Control_unit&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Functions of the control unit\")]\n\nThe Control Unit (CU) is digital circuitry contained within the processor that\ncoordinates the sequence of data movements into, out of, and between a\nprocessor's many sub-units. The result of these routed data movements through\nvarious digital circuits (sub-units) within the processor produces the\nmanipulated data expected by a software instruction (loaded earlier, likely\nfrom memory). It controls (conducts) data flow inside the processor and\nadditionally provides several external control signals to the rest of the\ncomputer to further direct data and instructions to/from processor external\ndestinations (i.e. memory).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nExamples of devices that require a CU are CPUs and graphics processing units\n(GPUs). The CU receives external instructions or commands which it converts\ninto a sequence of control signals that the CU applies to the data path to\nimplement a sequence of [register-transfer level](/wiki/Register-\ntransfer_level \"Register-transfer level\") operations.[3]\n\nMore precisely, the Control Unit (CU) is generally a sizable collection of\ncomplex digital circuitry interconnecting and directing the many execution\nunits (i.e. ALU, data buffers, registers) contained within a CPU. The CU is\nnormally the first CPU unit to accept from an externally stored computer\nprogram, a single instruction (based on the CPU's [instruction\nset](/wiki/Instruction_set \"Instruction set\")). The CU then decodes this\nindividual instruction into several sequential steps (fetching addresses/data\nfrom registers/ memory, managing execution [i.e. data sent to the ALU or I/O],\nand storing the resulting data back into registers/memory) that controls and\ncoordinates the CPU's inner works to properly manipulate the data. The design\nof these sequential steps are based on the needs of each instruction and can\nrange in number of steps, the order of execution, and which units are enabled.\n\nThus by only using a program of set instructions in memory, the CU will\nconfigure all the CPU's data flows as needed to manipulate the data correctly\nbetween instructions. This results in a computer that could run a complete\nprogram and require no human intervention to make hardware changes between\ninstructions (as had to be done when using only [punch\ncards](/wiki/Plugboard#Unit_record_equipment \"Plugboard\") for computations\nbefore stored programmed computers with CUs were invented). These detailed\nsteps from the CU dictate which of the CPU's interconnecting hardware control\nsignals to enable/disable or which CPU units are selected/de-selected and the\nunit's proper order of execution as required by the instruction's operation to\nproduce the desired manipulated data. Additionally, the CU's orderly hardware\ncoordination properly sequences these control signals then configures the many\nhardware units comprising the CPU, directing how data should also be moved,\nchanged, and stored outside the CPU (i.e. memory) according to the\ninstruction's objective.\n\nDepending on the type of instruction entering the CU, the order and number of\nsequential steps produced by the CU could vary the selection and configuration\nof which parts of the CPU's hardware are utilized to achieve the instruction's\nobjective (mainly moving, storing, and modifying data within the CPU). This\none feature, that efficiently uses just software instructions to\ncontrol/select/configure a computer's CPU hardware (via the CU) and eventually\nmanipulates a program's data, is a significant reason most modern computers\nare flexible and universal when running various programs. As compared to some\n1930s or 1940s computers without a proper CU, they often required rewiring\ntheir hardware when changing programs. This CU instruction decode process is\nthen repeated when the Program Counter is incremented to the next stored\nprogram address and the new instruction enters the CU from that address, and\nso on till the programs end.\n\nOther more advanced forms of Control Units manage the translation of\ninstructions (but not the data containing portion) into several micro-\ninstructions and the CU manages the scheduling of the micro-instructions\nbetween the selected execution units to which the data is then channeled and\nchanged according to the execution unit's function (i.e., ALU contains several\nfunctions). On some processors, the Control Unit may be further broken down\ninto additional units, such as an [instruction unit](/wiki/Instruction_unit\n\"Instruction unit\") or scheduling unit to handle scheduling, or a retirement\nunit to deal with results coming from the [instruction\npipeline](/wiki/Instruction_pipeline \"Instruction pipeline\"). Again, the\nControl Unit orchestrates the main functions of the CPU: carrying out stored\ninstructions in the software program then directing the flow of data\nthroughout the computer based upon these instructions (roughly likened to how\ntraffic lights will systematically control the flow of cars [containing data]\nto different locations within the traffic grid [CPU] until it parks at the\ndesired parking spot [memory address/register].[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The car\noccupants [data] then go into the building [execution unit] and comes back\nchanged in some way then get back into the car and returns to another location\nvia the controlled traffic grid).\n\n## Hardwired control\nunit[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Control_unit&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Hardwired control unit\")]\n\n**Hardwired control units** are implemented through use of [combinational\nlogic](/wiki/Combinational_logic \"Combinational logic\") units, featuring a\nfinite number of gates that can generate specific results based on the\ninstructions that were used to invoke those responses. Hardwired control units\nare generally faster than microprogrammed designs.[4]\n\nTheir design uses a fixed architecture—it requires changes in the wiring if\nthe [instruction set](/wiki/Instruction_set \"Instruction set\") is modified or\nchanged. This architecture is preferred in [reduced instruction set\ncomputers](/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing \"Reduced instruction set\ncomputing\") (RISC) as they use a simpler instruction set.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nA controller that uses this approach can operate at high speed; however, it\nhas little flexibility, and the complexity of the instruction set it can\nimplement is limited.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe hardwired approach has become less popular as computers have evolved.\nPreviously, control units for CPUs used ad-hoc logic, and they were difficult\nto design.[5]\n\n[[1]](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/prithvisharma9083/computer-\narchitecture-42377303)\n\n## Microprogram control\nunit[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Control_unit&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Microprogram control unit\")]\n\nMain article: [Microcode](/wiki/Microcode \"Microcode\")\n\nThe idea of microprogramming was introduced by [Maurice\nWilkes](/wiki/Maurice_Wilkes \"Maurice Wilkes\") in 1951 as an intermediate\nlevel to execute computer program instructions. Microprograms were organized\nas a sequence of _microinstructions_ and stored in special control memory. The\nalgorithm for the microprogram control unit,unlike the hardwired control unit,\nis usually specified by [flowchart](/wiki/Flowchart \"Flowchart\")\ndescription.[6] The main advantage of the microprogram control unit is the\nsimplicity of its structure. Outputs of the controller are organized in\nmicroinstructions and they can be easily replaced.[7]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Control_unit&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [CPU design](/wiki/CPU_design \"CPU design\")\n  * [Computer architecture](/wiki/Computer_architecture \"Computer architecture\")\n  * [Richards controller](/wiki/Richards_controller \"Richards controller\")\n  * [Controller (computing)](/wiki/Controller_\\(computing\\) \"Controller \\(computing\\)\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Control_unit&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Patterson, David; Hennessy, John (2011). _Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, 4th ed., revised_.
