After successfully collecting a bone\nfragment, the team's survivors barely escape the island following attacks by\nthe _[Mosasaurus](/wiki/Mosasaurus \"Mosasaurus\")_ and _[Tyrannosaurus\nrex](/wiki/Tyrannosaurus \"Tyrannosaurus\")_.\n\nThree years later in 2018, a [U.S. Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United\nStates Senate\") hearing in [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C.\n\"Washington, D.C.\") debates whether Isla Nublar's dinosaurs should be saved\nfrom an impending volcanic eruption. Mathematician [Dr. Ian\nMalcolm](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Ian_Malcolm \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\") testifies that the dinosaurs should be allowed to\nperish to correct [John\nHammond's](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#John_Hammond \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\") mistake of [cloning](/wiki/Cloning \"Cloning\") them.\nMeanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager Claire Dearing has\nestablished the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the\nSenate rules against rescuing the dinosaurs, Hammond's former partner,\n[Benjamin\nLockwood](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Sir_Benjamin_Lockwood \"List\nof Jurassic Park characters\"), summons Claire to his [Northern\nCalifornia](/wiki/Northern_California \"Northern California\") estate. Lockwood\nand his aide, [Eli Mills](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Eli_Mills\n\"List of Jurassic Park characters\"), reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs\nto a new island sanctuary. Claire is needed to help reactivate the park's\ndinosaur [tracking system](/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking \"GPS wildlife\ntracking\") to locate the animals, particularly Blue, the last living\n_[Velociraptor](/wiki/Velociraptor \"Velociraptor\")_. Although they are\nestranged, Claire recruits Jurassic World's former _Velociraptor_ trainer and\nBlue's alpha, Owen Grady, to help capture her.\n\nOn Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician [Franklin\nWebb](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Franklin_Webb \"List of Jurassic\nPark characters\") get the [tracking system](/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking \"GPS\nwildlife tracking\") online. Owen, paleo-veterinarian [Zia\nRodriguez](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Zia_Rodriguez \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\"), and a mercenary team led by [Ken\nWheatley](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Ken_Wheatley \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\") search for Blue. Upon finding her, the encounter\nescalates, resulting in a mercenary shooting Blue and Wheatley\n[tranquilizing](/wiki/Sedative \"Sedative\") Owen. The mercenaries take Zia so\nshe can treat Blue's injury. Their ship departs for the [U.S.\nmainland](/wiki/Contiguous_United_States \"Contiguous United States\") as the\nanimals left behind die in the eruption. Claire, Franklin, and Owen sneak\naboard in time and assist Zia in [transfusing](/wiki/Blood_transfusion \"Blood\ntransfusion\") Blue with _Tyrannosaurus_ blood. The group now realize the\ncaptured dinosaurs were never being transported to a new island and are for\nanother purpose.\n\nBack at the estate, Lockwood's orphaned pre-teen granddaughter\n[Maisie](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Maisie_Lockwood \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\") overhears Mills and auctioneer [Gunnar\nEversol](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Gunnar_Eversol \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\") secretly planning to auction the captured dinosaurs\non the [black market](/wiki/Black_market \"Black market\"). They will also\nunveil the\n_[Indoraptor](/wiki/List_of_cloned_animals_in_the_Jurassic_Park_series#Indoraptor\n\"List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park series\")_ , a new [genetically-\nengineered](/wiki/Genetic_engineering \"Genetic engineering\") dinosaur created\nby geneticist [Dr. Henry\nWu](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Henry_Wu \"List of Jurassic Park\ncharacters\") using _Indominus rex_ and _Velociraptor_ DNA. Wu wants Blue's DNA\nto create an enhanced _Indoraptor_ , unaware that Blue's blood is\ncontaminated. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he confronts\nMills, who murders him. Maisie is later revealed to have been cloned from\nLockwood's deceased daughter and is the reason John Hammond, who opposed\n[human cloning](/wiki/Human_cloning \"Human cloning\"), ended their partnership.\n\nThe dinosaurs are transported to Lockwood's estate and caged. Zia and Franklin\nevade capture, but Owen and Claire are apprehended and confined. Owen incites\na _[Stygimoloch](/wiki/Stygimoloch \"Stygimoloch\")_ into breaking open their\ncell. They find Maisie who leads them to the auction where the _Indoraptor_ is\nbeing sold despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the\nproceedings by luring the _Stygimoloch_ into the room. In the ensuing chaos,\nWheatley tranquilizes the _Indoraptor_ to extract a tooth as a trophy, but it\nfeigns sedation and escapes, killing him, Eversol, and others. The\n_Indoraptor_ hunts Owen, Claire, and Maisie throughout the mansion. Zia\nreleases Blue, who attacks the _Indoraptor_ , causing it to fall through a\nglass roof to its death.\n\nWhen a [hydrogen cyanide](/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide \"Hydrogen cyanide\") gas leak\nthreatens the caged animals, Maisie is unable to let them die and frees them\ndespite Owen's warning. Mills is killed and the _Indominus_ bone destroyed by\nthe _Tyrannosaurus_. Owen, Claire, Maisie, Zia, and Franklin safely get away,\nwhile Blue and the other dinosaurs escape.\n\nIn a new U.S. Senate hearing, Dr. Malcolm declares the beginning of a Neo-\nJurassic Age where humans and dinosaurs must learn to coexist. The closing\nscenes show the freed dinosaurs roaming wilderness and outer urban areas.\n\n## Cast\n\nMain article: [List of Jurassic Park\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters \"List of Jurassic Park\ncharacters\")\n\n  * [Chris Pratt](/wiki/Chris_Pratt \"Chris Pratt\") as Owen Grady: A [Navy](/wiki/United_States_Navy \"United States Navy\") veteran and former _Velociraptor_ handler for Jurassic World.[11]\n  * [Bryce Dallas Howard](/wiki/Bryce_Dallas_Howard \"Bryce Dallas Howard\") as Claire Dearing: Jurassic World's former [operations manager](/wiki/Operations_management \"Operations management\"), now a dinosaur-rights [activist](/wiki/Activism \"Activism\"), who has founded the Dinosaur Protection Group at [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\") to save the surviving dinosaurs from Isla Nublar.[11][12]\n  * [Rafe Spall](/wiki/Rafe_Spall \"Rafe Spall\") as Eli Mills:   \nLockwood's ambitious assistant who recruits Owen and Claire to rescue the\ndinosaurs. Speaking of his character’s actions over the course of the film,\nSpall noted that, “Ambition is such a powerful emotion, you can get wrapped up\nin it and end up doing things in order to succeed. This character believes he\nis doing right. He has been entrusted with pushing Lockwood’s fortune into the\nfuture and making it survive after he dies. Mills feels he is simply doing\nwhat he was asked to do.”[13][3]\n\n  * [Justice Smith](/wiki/Justice_Smith \"Justice Smith\") as Franklin Webb: A former [IT technician](/wiki/Information_systems_technician \"Information systems technician\") for Jurassic World who is now the Dinosaur Protection Group's [systems analyst](/wiki/Systems_analyst \"Systems analyst\") and [hacker](/wiki/Hacking_\\(computer_security\\) \"Hacking \\(computer security\\)\").[14][12]\n  * [Daniella Pineda](/wiki/Daniella_Pineda \"Daniella Pineda\") as Zia Rodriguez: A former [Marine](/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps \"United States Marine Corps\") who is now the Dinosaur Protection Group's paleoveterinarian.[14][12][3]\n  * [James Cromwell](/wiki/James_Cromwell \"James Cromwell\") as Sir Benjamin Lockwood: [John Hammond](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#John_Hammond \"List of Jurassic Park characters\")'s former partner in developing the technology to clone dinosaurs.[15][16]\n  * [Toby Jones](/wiki/Toby_Jones \"Toby Jones\") as Gunnar Eversol:   \nAn auctioneer host at Lockwood Estate who sells the Isla Nublar dinosaurs for\nprofit.[17][3] In an interview, Jones likened his character to that of “a\nrogue arms dealer; he sees profits in selling these creatures as weapons. He\nis totally morally neutral about whatever he is selling. He is only interested\nin whether or not it will make him a profit.”[3]\n\n  * [Ted Levine](/wiki/Ted_Levine \"Ted Levine\") as Ken Wheatley: A seasoned mercenary who commands the rescue operation on Isla Nublar.[3]\n  * [B. D. Wong](/wiki/B._D._Wong \"B. D. Wong\") as Henry Wu:   \nThe former head [geneticist](/wiki/Geneticist \"Geneticist\") of both Jurassic\nWorld and the original Jurassic Park. Speaking of his character’s actions,\nWong stated: “I do think he’s motivated by his love for science and his own\nego, which is well supported by his massive achievements ... I think he turns\na blind eye to the human suffering that comes as a result because he thinks\nhe’s looking at some bigger picture.”[18][19]\n\n  * Isabella Sermon as Maisie Lockwood: Lockwood's juvenile granddaughter and legal ward following her parents' deaths.[20][21][22][23]\n  * [Geraldine Chaplin](/wiki/Geraldine_Chaplin \"Geraldine Chaplin\") as Iris: The Lockwood Estate housekeeper, Maisie's nanny, and protector of the Lockwood family's secrets.[24][3]\n  * [Jeff Goldblum](/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum \"Jeff Goldblum\") as [Ian Malcolm](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Ian_Malcolm \"List of Jurassic Park characters\"):   \nAn expert in [chaos theory](/wiki/Chaos_theory \"Chaos theory\") who once\nconsulted for [InGen](/wiki/InGen \"InGen\")'s Jurassic Park.[25] In a podcast\ninterview, Goldblum revealed of his role \"It's small… who knows, they may cut\nme out entirely! But if I stay in, I'll be a sprig of parsley or a little\ngarnish, hopefully with some impact!\"[26][27] Director Bayona confirmed that\nGoldblum's role is simply a [cameo](/wiki/Cameo_appearance \"Cameo\nappearance\"), stating, \"He doesn't have a major role in the action but it's\ndefinitely a very meaningful one in terms of the story.\"[28]\n\n  * [Peter Jason](/wiki/Peter_Jason \"Peter Jason\") as Senator Sherwood: A Senator who is among those who debate about saving the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDuring early conversations on the 2015 film _[Jurassic\nWorld](/wiki/Jurassic_World \"Jurassic World\")_ , executive producer [Steven\nSpielberg](/wiki/Steven_Spielberg \"Steven Spielberg\") told director [Colin\nTrevorrow](/wiki/Colin_Trevorrow \"Colin Trevorrow\") that he was interested in\nhaving several more films made.[29] In April 2014, Trevorrow announced that\nsequels had been discussed: \"We wanted to create something that would be a\nlittle bit less arbitrary and episodic, and something that could potentially\narc into a series that would feel like a complete story.\"[30] Trevorrow said\n[Chris Pratt](/wiki/Chris_Pratt \"Chris Pratt\") and [Omar Sy](/wiki/Omar_Sy\n\"Omar Sy\") might reprise their roles for the next few films and said he would\ndirect the film if asked.[30] Trevorrow later told Spielberg that he would\nonly focus on directing one film in the series.[29] In May 2015, Trevorrow\nannounced that he would not direct another film in the series: \"I would be\ninvolved in some way, but not as director.\" Trevorrow felt that different\ndirectors could bring different qualities to future films.[31] Pratt had been\nsigned for future films in the series,[32] as was [Ty\nSimpkins](/wiki/Ty_Simpkins \"Ty Simpkins\"), who portrayed Gray in _Jurassic\nWorld_.[33]\n\nOn June 3, 2015, Trevorrow stated that _Jurassic World_ left many story\npossibilities open: \"I really like the idea that this group of geneticists\naren't the only people who can make a dinosaur […] when you think of the\ndifferences between [Apple](/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\") and\n[PC](/wiki/Personal_computer \"Personal computer\")—the minute something goes\n[open-source](/wiki/Open_source \"Open source\"), there are all kinds of\nentities and interests that may be able to utilize that technology.\"[34] On\nJune 8, 2015, _Jurassic World_ producer [Frank\nMarshall](/wiki/Frank_Marshall_\\(producer\\) \"Frank Marshall \\(producer\\)\") met\nwith Trevorrow and [Universal Pictures](/wiki/Universal_Pictures \"Universal\nPictures\") to discuss a sequel.[35] Later that month, Trevorrow did not deny\nthat the film could involve \"dinosaur soldiers\"[36] and said the series is\n\"not always gonna be about a Jurassic Park\", saying he felt that future films\ncould explore the idea of dinosaurs and humans co-existing.[29] Trevorrow also\nhinted that the next film may not involve the Jurassic World theme park[37]\nand said he would be interested in seeing a _Jurassic Park_ film made by one\nof several Spanish horror film directors, whose names he did not mention.[38]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nOn July 23, 2015, Universal announced that a fifth film had been scheduled for\na June 22, 2018, release date in the U.S. It was also announced that Trevorrow\nwould write the script with his writing partner [Derek\nConnolly](/wiki/Derek_Connolly \"Derek Connolly\"), as they did for _Jurassic\nWorld_ ; that the film would be produced by Frank Marshall; and that Spielberg\nand Trevorrow would act as executive producers. Universal also said that Chris\nPratt and [Bryce Dallas Howard](/wiki/Bryce_Dallas_Howard \"Bryce Dallas\nHoward\") would reprise their roles from the previous film.[11] At the time of\nthe film's announcement, Trevorrow said the series \"isn't always going to be\nlimited to theme parks\" and confirmed that the film would not involve \"a bunch\nof dinosaurs chasing people on an island\" stating, \"That'll get old real\nfast.\"[39] Trevorrow also spoke of the film's possible open-source storyline:\n\"It's almost like [InGen](/wiki/InGen \"InGen\") is [Mac](/wiki/Mac_OS \"Mac\nOS\"), but what if PC gets their hands on it? What if there are 15 different\nentities around the world who can make a dinosaur?\"[39]\n\nIn August 2015, Howard said that the script was being written,[40] and it was\nannounced that the film would be released in the UK two weeks early, on June\n7, 2018.[41] Later that year, [B. D. Wong](/wiki/B._D._Wong \"B. D. Wong\") said\nhe \"would be happy to return\" as [Dr. Henry\nWu](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Henry_Wu \"List of Jurassic Park\ncharacters\"),[42] while Howard announced that filming would begin in 2017.[43]\nHoward also said she would be interested in seeing characters from earlier\n_Jurassic Park_ films return for the fifth film, saying, \"I could see versions\nof the film where a lot of the characters come back.\"[44] By October 2015,\ndirector [J. A. Bayona](/wiki/J._A._Bayona \"J. A. Bayona\") was being\nconsidered to direct the film, although he chose instead to direct the [_World\nWar Z_ sequel](/wiki/World_War_Z_\\(film\\)#Sequel \"World War Z \\(film\\)\"), a\nproject to which he had already signed on.[45] In January 2016, it was\nreported that Bayona could still be a candidate to direct the film after he\ndropped out of the _World War Z_ sequel due to other commitments.[46]\n\nIn March 2016, [London](/wiki/London \"London\") was being\n[scouted](/wiki/Location_scouting \"Location scouting\") as a possible filming\nlocation and setting for the film,[47] and it was subsequently announced that\nfilming would take place at a UK studio.[48] On April 14, 2016, actor [Jeff\nGoldblum](/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum \"Jeff Goldblum\") said he had no plans to appear\nin the film as his character [Ian\nMalcolm](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Ian_Malcolm \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\"), although he said he was open to the\npossibility.[49] On April 18, 2016, Bayona was announced as the film's\ndirector, with Belén Atienza and Patrick Crowley joining Marshall as\nproducers.[50] Spielberg, Marshall, and [Kathleen\nKennedy](/wiki/Kathleen_Kennedy_\\(producer\\) \"Kathleen Kennedy \\(producer\\)\")\nhad been impressed by Bayona's 2012 film, _[The\nImpossible](/wiki/The_Impossible_\\(2012_film\\) \"The Impossible \\(2012\nfilm\\)\")_ , and initially considered having him direct _Jurassic World_ , but\nhe declined as he felt there was not enough time for production.[51][52]\nTrevorrow wanted Bayona to direct the film after seeing his 2007 horror film,\n_[The Orphanage](/wiki/The_Orphanage_\\(film\\) \"The Orphanage\n\\(film\\)\")_.[53][54] Before Bayona was hired, he met with Trevorrow and became\nenthused with the project after being shown the script's second half, which\nwould play out like a haunted house film.[55] After Bayona was hired,\nTrevorrow said about the film, \"We're moving it into new territory. J. A.\nBayona is an incredible director and I know he'll push the boundaries of what\na 'Jurassic' movie is. I think it's important that we take risks. A franchise\nmust evolve or perish.\"[56] Trevorrow and Bayona worked closely throughout the\nfilm's production.[3] In June 2016, actor [Sam Neill](/wiki/Sam_Neill \"Sam\nNeill\") was asked if he would return to the series as Dr. Alan Grant and\nresponded, \"You never say never, but I think it's moved on. It's different\ntimes.\"[57]\n\nThe film, under the [working title](/wiki/Working_title \"Working title\") of\n_Ancient Futures_ ,[58] was in full pre-production as of July 2016, with\n[storyboards](/wiki/Storyboard \"Storyboard\") being designed.[59] [Andy\nNicholson](/wiki/Andy_Nicholson_\\(production_designer\\) \"Andy Nicholson\n\\(production designer\\)\") was hired as the film's [production\ndesigner](/wiki/Production_designer \"Production designer\") and spent four\nweeks with Bayona in [Barcelona](/wiki/Barcelona \"Barcelona\"), discussing\nreference pictures and background details, as well as Bayona's ideas for the\nLockwood mansion.[3] Production was scheduled to begin in Hawaii in February\n2017.[60][61] [Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\") was also confirmed as a filming\nlocation,[62] including [Brecon Beacons](/wiki/Brecon_Beacons \"Brecon\nBeacons\") and [Penbryn](/wiki/Penbryn \"Penbryn\").[63] Trevorrow stated that\nHawaii would be used as a primary filming location, while U.K. shooting would\nbe limited to studios, without the story taking place there. Trevorrow also\nsaid that the film would feature many dinosaurs that were not seen in previous\nfilms and denied that the film's story would involve militarized dinosaurs,\nwhich would only be mentioned in the film.[64]\n\nFor the film's second half in which dinosaurs are transported by boat to the\nmainland, [Ecuador](/wiki/Ecuador \"Ecuador\") and [Peru](/wiki/Peru \"Peru\") had\nboth been scouted as possible filming locations and settings, while Marshall\nthought that [Cabo San Lucas](/wiki/Cabo_San_Lucas \"Cabo San Lucas\") would be\nideal, but such locations ultimately did not work for the film's story.\nAlthough the film was partially shot in England, Spielberg felt that the\ncountry was too far from the fictional Isla Nublar to be used as the in-film\nsetting during the second half, as he and the producers did not want the film\nto focus too much time on a boat. Crowley stated, \"Rather than making it a\nmovie about traveling on a boat, which is not very exciting, you needed to get\nto the place.\"[65]\n\nIn September 2016, Bayona confirmed that the film would be the second chapter\nin a planned _Jurassic World_ trilogy.[66] Later that year, Marshall said that\nWong was \"probably going to come back,\"[67] while _Jurassic World_ composer\n[Michael Giacchino](/wiki/Michael_Giacchino \"Michael Giacchino\") confirmed\nthat he would return to compose the fifth film.[68] [Óscar\nFaura](/wiki/%C3%93scar_Faura \"Óscar Faura\") was announced as the film's\ncinematographer at the end of the year.[69]\n\n### Writing\n\nAlthough Spielberg was heavily involved in the development of ideas for\n_Jurassic World_ , he had Trevorrow and Connolly devise their own ideas for\nthe sequel, while retaining final approval on the project.[70] In June 2015,\napproximately two weeks after the theatrical release of _Jurassic World_ ,\nTrevorrow embarked on a road trip from Los Angeles back to his home state of\nVermont. Connolly agreed to accompany Trevorrow on the trip so they could\ndiscuss a basic set of ideas that Trevorrow had for the film.[3] During their\neight-day trip,[71] the writers began work on the script and devised the basic\nstory.[72][73] Trevorrow said the film's story was inspired by a quote from\n[Dr. Alan Grant](/wiki/Dr._Alan_Grant \"Dr. Alan Grant\") in [the first\nfilm](/wiki/Jurassic_Park_\\(film\\) \"Jurassic Park \\(film\\)\"): \"Dinosaurs and\nman, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution, have suddenly\nbeen thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest\nidea of what to expect?\"[74] Trevorrow also said that the story was heavily\ninspired by the idea that, \"A mistake made a long time ago just can't be\nundone.\"[64]\n\nThe film is also based on concepts from [Michael\nCrichton](/wiki/Michael_Crichton \"Michael Crichton\")'s novel _[Jurassic\nPark](/wiki/Jurassic_Park_\\(novel\\) \"Jurassic Park \\(novel\\)\")_ (1990) and its\nsequel _[The Lost World](/wiki/The_Lost_World_\\(Crichton_novel\\) \"The Lost\nWorld \\(Crichton novel\\)\")_ (1995), and includes dialogue from the first\nnovel.[64] Isla Nublar's volcano was an idea that existed in the first novel,\nand the writers chose to incorporate the idea into the film's plot.[75]\nTrevorrow compared the destruction of Isla Nublar to \"the burning down of a\nchurch or a temple,\" stating, \"I honestly think it's like killing off a\ncharacter in a way, and if you're going to do that, as long as you approach it\nwith the proper respect and acknowledgement that you understand how indelible\nand permanent what you're doing is, then hopefully people will have an\nemotional response but they won't hate you for it.\"[76] The idea to include a\n\"silent partner\" of John Hammond was also inspired by the _Jurassic Park_\nnovel. Although the character of Benjamin Lockwood was not featured in the\nnovel, the book depicts the early years leading up to the cloning of\ndinosaurs, which made Trevorrow realize that there would have been many people\ninvolved in such a project, convincing him that someone like Lockwood would be\namong those people.[77]\n\nIn his initial [film treatment](/wiki/Film_treatment \"Film treatment\"),\nTrevorrow had included story elements that Marshall and Crowley considered\nexcessive for a single film, as the producers felt it was also important to\ninclude details about Owen and Claire's lives after the events of _Jurassic\nWorld_.[65] Although the original ending was the same as the final film,\nTrevorrow had wanted to include more details about the integration of\ndinosaurs into the world, before choosing to remove such details to keep the\nstory focused.[78] For the script's structure, Trevorrow said he had been\ninspired by Spielberg's 2015 film _[Bridge of\nSpies](/wiki/Bridge_of_Spies_\\(film\\) \"Bridge of Spies \\(film\\)\")_ , in which\ntwo seemingly unrelated stories \"collide in the middle, and move on\ntogether.\"[70] Trevorrow was also inspired by the 1975 film _[Three Days of\nthe Condor](/wiki/Three_Days_of_the_Condor \"Three Days of the Condor\")_ ,\nstating, \"It's one of those places where you think you know what the score is,\nand then everything changes, and then suddenly you don't know who to\ntrust.\"[70] Having directed _Jurassic World_ , Trevorrow became familiar with\nhow [animatronics](/wiki/Animatronics \"Animatronics\") worked and wrote scenes\ninto the sequel in a way that would allow for their use, as animatronics are\nincapable of certain actions such as running.[79]\n\nRegarding the idea of [human cloning](/wiki/Human_cloning \"Human cloning\"),\nTrevorrow stated that \"we're so much closer to cloning humans than we are to\ncloning dinosaurs. It felt like far less of a leap to me than dinosaurs do.\n[...] To have a character who has such deep love and has felt such loss and\nthe inability to go on, I think is something we all feel. So the idea that you\nmight be able to bring someone back in that way is emotionally grounded in a\nvery universal idea.\"[80] Trevorrow also stated that he was interested in \"the\nlarger impact\" of genetic power, including its emotional impact and its\npotential human impact, while further stating \"we knew that we didn't want to\ncontinue to make movies about the dangers of messing with science. We want to\ntell a story about where we are now, which is that we _have_ messed with\nscience, we _have_ fundamentally altered our world and now we're dealing with\nthe consequences.\"[77] Trevorrow was nervous about how audiences would react\nto the story's human cloning aspect, an idea that was supported by Spielberg,\nwho was excited about the questions that such an idea could raise in the\nfilm's sequel.[76] Because of criticism regarding the death of\n[Zara](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Zara_Young \"List of Jurassic\nPark characters\") in the previous film, Trevorrow stated that for _Jurassic\nWorld: Fallen Kingdom_ , \"We made sure that every death was earned. Everybody\ndeserves their death in this movie, a lesson learned. In 2018 everyone earns\nit. Horrible people.\"[76]\n\nAfter Bayona was hired, he began reading all of Crichton's novels—including\n_Jurassic Park_ and _The Lost World_ —for inspiration and \"to try to immerse\nmyself in Crichton's mind.\"[81][82] Trevorrow and Connolly began working with\nBayona in July 2016, to perfect the script to the director's liking.[64]\nTrevorrow stated that the film would be more \"suspenseful and scary\" than its\npredecessor: \"It's just the way it's designed; it's the way the story plays\nout. I knew I wanted Bayona to direct it long before anyone ever heard that it\nwas a possibility, so the whole thing was just built around his skillset.\"[64]\nTrevorrow later described the film as \"_The Impossible_ meets _The Orphanage_\nwith dinosaurs.\"[54] Bayona stated that with the first half of the film set on\nan island, \"you have what you expect from a _Jurassic_ movie,\" while the\nsecond half \"moves to a totally different environment that feels more\nsuspenseful, darker, claustrophobic, and even has this kind of gothic element,\nwhich I love.\"[83] Bayona's concept of gothic suspense for the film was\ninfluenced by [Alfred Hitchcock](/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock \"Alfred Hitchcock\")\nfilms,[84] and he compared the film to _[The Empire Strikes\nBack](/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back \"The Empire Strikes Back\")_ and _[Star\nTrek II: The Wrath of Khan](/wiki/Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan \"Star Trek\nII: The Wrath of Khan\")_ , which were both considered darker than their\npredecessors.[85]\n\nTrevorrow said the film's dinosaurs would be \"a parable of the treatment\nanimals receive today: the abuse, medical experimentation, pets, having wild\nanimals in zoos like prisons, the use the military has made of them, animals\nas weapons.\"[86] The idea of weaponized dinosaurs came from Spielberg.[71][87]\nTrevorrow said that with the film's dinosaur auction, \"The worst instincts of\nmankind are revealed. The first film was very clearly about corporate greed.\nThis is just about human greed.\"[88] The film includes ideas previously\nfeatured in a rejected 2004 draft for _Jurassic Park IV_ (later _Jurassic\nWorld_), presented in the same structure: a return to Isla Nublar followed by\na second half set in a large [Gothic](/wiki/Gothic_architecture \"Gothic\narchitecture\") building on the mainland. The idea of a dinosaur auction was\nalso present in the rejected draft, which Trevorrow had read while writing the\nfirst _Jurassic World_ film.[89][90]\n\nBayona had his own ideas incorporated into the script while essentially\nretaining the same original story devised by Trevorrow and Connolly.[59] The\nfilm's underwater opening sequence was already in Trevorrow and Connolly's\nscript, and Bayona asked Trevorrow to push for it to become a bigger scene\nwith a larger set.[55] Among Trevorrow's ideas was to include [Jeff\nGoldblum](/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum \"Jeff Goldblum\")'s character of Ian Malcolm, who\nappeared in the franchise's earlier films.[91] Trevorrow and Goldblum\ndiscussed dialogue ideas for Malcolm, and Trevorrow stated that he used a lot\nof dialogue from Crichton's _Jurassic Park_ novel for the character.[3][92]\nMarshall stated that Trevorrow wrote Malcolm as \"the 'Uh oh, danger, I told\nyou so' kind of character,\"[52] and Trevorrow said about the character, \"I saw\nhim as kind of [Al Gore](/wiki/Al_Gore \"Al Gore\"). He's got a beard now, and\nhe's like, 'I told all of you this was going to be a disaster, and sure enough\nit is.'\"[93] Bayona and Trevorrow ultimately removed certain moments from the\nscript that they felt would be better for the sequel, which was expected to\ndepict dinosaurs having spread around the world.[76]\n\n### Casting\n\nIn October 2016, casting was underway for the role of a nine-year-old\ngirl.[94] Approximately 2,500 girls were interviewed for the role, which\nultimately went to Isabella Sermon, marking her film debut.[3] By November\n2016, [Tom Holland](/wiki/Tom_Holland_\\(actor\\) \"Tom Holland \\(actor\\)\")—who\npreviously starred in _The Impossible_ —had discussed having a possible role\nin the film, but he did not believe he would be available for filming because\nof scheduling conflicts.[95] [Toby Jones](/wiki/Toby_Jones \"Toby Jones\"),\n[Rafe Spall](/wiki/Rafe_Spall \"Rafe Spall\"), and [Justice\nSmith](/wiki/Justice_Smith \"Justice Smith\") were cast at the end of the\nyear.[96][97][98]\n\n[Daniella Pineda](/wiki/Daniella_Pineda \"Daniella Pineda\"), [Ted\nLevine](/wiki/Ted_Levine \"Ted Levine\") and [James\nCromwell](/wiki/James_Cromwell \"James Cromwell\") were cast in early\n2017,[99][100][16] while Wong confirmed his return as Dr. Henry Wu.[18] To\nmaintain secrecy, the _Ancient Futures_ title was used in the casting phase.\nDuring auditions, references to dinosaurs were replaced with animals such as\nlions and grizzly bears.[101][102] To convince the studio that Pineda was\nright for the role of Zia, Bayona had her demonstrate that she could perform\ncomedy and drama scenes, as well as [improvisation](/wiki/Improvisation\n\"Improvisation\"). Pineda auditioned a total of seven times before receiving\nthe role. She auditioned for Bayona, Atienza, and Crowley, and did not meet\nthe cast until she arrived in England for filming.[103]\n\nIn March 2017, Bayona announced that [Geraldine\nChaplin](/wiki/Geraldine_Chaplin \"Geraldine Chaplin\"), who had roles in each\nof his previous films, had joined the cast.[24] The next month, it was\nannounced that [Jeff Goldblum](/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum \"Jeff Goldblum\") would be\nreprising his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm from the first two films.[25] Bayona\nconsidered Malcolm a \"great character!\"[82] while Marshall said, \"The world\nhas changed a lot since Ian Malcolm went to Jurassic Park and we need his\npoint of view now more than ever. He told us about chaos theory, he was\nright.\"[104]\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming began at Langley Business Centre in [Slough](/wiki/Slough \"Slough\"),\nEngland, on February 23, 2017.[105][106] Scenes shot at the business center\nincluded Claire's Dinosaur Protection Group office, Owen training his baby\nraptors, and Owen and Claire attempting to retrieve blood from the sedated _T.\nrex_.[3] A majority of filming in England took place at [Pinewood\nStudios](/wiki/Pinewood_Studios \"Pinewood Studios\").[107] Because of its large\n[sound stages](/wiki/Sound_stage \"Sound stage\"), Pinewood Studios was\nconsidered perfect for the film's many interior scenes.[65] After filming\nconcluded in England, production moved to [Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii\n\"Hawaii\"),[108] which was used as a primary filming location.[64] Scenes shot\nin Hawaii were set on [Isla Nublar](/wiki/Isla_Nublar \"Isla Nublar\"), the\nfictional island featured in the first and fourth films.[109] Scenes were also\nexpected to be shot at [Brecon Beacons National\nPark](/wiki/Brecon_Beacons_National_Park \"Brecon Beacons National Park\") in\nWales.[110] The film was shot in [CinemaScope](/wiki/CinemaScope\n\"CinemaScope\"), and is the first entry in the _Jurassic Park_ series that is\npresented in a 2.40:1 [aspect ratio](/wiki/Aspect_ratio_\\(image\\) \"Aspect\nratio \\(image\\)\"). The film crew used [Arri Alexa\n65](/wiki/Arri_Alexa#Alexa_65 \"Arri Alexa\") cameras throughout the duration of\nfilming.[91] Several scenes were shot to reference various films including\n_[From Here to Eternity](/wiki/From_Here_to_Eternity \"From Here to Eternity\")_\n(1953) and _[Dracula](/wiki/Dracula_\\(1979_film\\) \"Dracula \\(1979 film\\)\")_\n(1979), as well as Spielberg's films _[Raiders of the Lost\nArk](/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\")_ (1981) and\n_[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial](/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial \"E.T. the\nExtra-Terrestrial\")_ (1982).[76][111] Spielberg was shown scenes from the film\nduring production and he offered his opinions to Bayona.[53]\n\nDuring filming and in between [takes](/wiki/Take \"Take\"), Bayona used an\n[iPod](/wiki/IPod \"IPod\") to play different types of music on set to inspire\nthe actors during certain scenes, as he had done for his previous\nfilms.[112][113] Bayona also played sound effects from previous films in the\nseries,[114] including a _T. rex_ roar that he sometimes used to get a natural\nreaction from the actors.[115] In particular, Bayona played unexpected sounds\nand loud music to scare Smith for certain scenes, as his character is\nportrayed as easily frightened.[101][112] Prior to being filmed, Bayona and\nPratt discussed each scene involving the character of Owen, and many of\nPratt's ideas were added into the film. Speaking about Levine's character,\nBayona said, \"He came with this idea of creating this kind of military man. He\njust wanted to portray the most hateable character possible. […] And he was so\ncreative on set, trying to give ideas, bringing story notes to make this\ncharacter more and more hateable.\"[55] The film includes several indirect\nreferences to U.S. president [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald\nTrump\"), including an idea from Trevorrow in which a [news\nticker](/wiki/News_ticker \"News ticker\") states that the \"U.S. president\" has\nquestioned the \"existence of dinosaurs in the first place.\"[116][117][76][118]\nJones was allowed to decide his character's appearance, which included a wig\nsimilar to [Trump's hairstyle](/wiki/Donald_Trump%27s_hair \"Donald Trump's\nhair\").[76][117] An unscripted moment that was left in the film involves\nLevine's character referring to Pineda's character Zia as a \"[nasty\nwoman](/wiki/Nasty_woman \"Nasty woman\")\", a line that was previously made\nfamous by Trump.[117][119][118]\n\nIn April 2017, scenes were filmed at [East Berkshire\nCollege](/wiki/East_Berkshire_College \"East Berkshire College\") in\n[Berkshire](/wiki/Berkshire \"Berkshire\"), England,[120] and at [Loch\nLong](/wiki/Loch_Long \"Loch Long\") in [Argyll and Bute](/wiki/Argyll_and_Bute\n\"Argyll and Bute\"), Scotland.[121] Also that month, filming took place at\nHartland Park—formerly the [Pyestock jet engine test\nsite](/wiki/National_Gas_Turbine_Establishment \"National Gas Turbine\nEstablishment\")—in [Fleet, Hampshire](/wiki/Fleet,_Hampshire \"Fleet,\nHampshire\"), England,[122][123] where the film's opening sequence was shot.\nThe scene was filmed through the night and involved helicopters, rain\nmachines, and lightning simulators to depict a thunderstorm.[3] Bayona\ndescribed the opening scene as a \"massive action piece\" that resembled the\n[prologues](/wiki/Prologue \"Prologue\") used in [James Bond\nfilms](/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_films \"List of James Bond films\").[124] Scenes\nwere filmed on sets at [Hawley Common](/wiki/Hawley,_Hampshire \"Hawley,\nHampshire\"), also in Hampshire,[123] where the exterior of Lockwood's mansion\nwas built, as well as a mainland loading dock where the dinosaurs are\nbrought.[3] The exterior of the ship that transports Isla Nublar's dinosaurs\nto the mainland was created entirely through computer-generated effects by\n[Industrial Light & Magic](/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic \"Industrial Light\n& Magic\") (ILM), which worked on the previous films. The ship's interior was\nconstructed by Nicholson and his team as a large set at Pinewood Studios, and\nafter filming, the set was rebuilt to depict the large rooftop of the Lockwood\nEstate.[3] The exterior of the [Cragside](/wiki/Cragside \"Cragside\") country\nhouse in [Northumberland](/wiki/Northumberland \"Northumberland\"), England,\nalong with its [coniferous](/wiki/Conifer \"Conifer\") surrounding, was used to\ndepict the Lockwood Estate exterior. The film crew took [plate\nshots](/wiki/Motion_control_photography \"Motion control photography\") of\nCragside and used a computer to combine the shots with footage filmed on set\nto create the exterior of the Lockwood Estate. No actors were involved in the\nCragside shoot.[125][126]\n\nNicholson [previsualized](/wiki/Previsualization \"Previsualization\") each of\nthe sets that he and his team built to ensure they would be large enough for\nthe intended scenes, stating, \"Someone can tell you a Velociraptor is X-feet\nlong, but until you see it in the space, you can't appreciate what that means\nin terms of your set and the action that needs to take place within it.\"[3]\nThe interior of the multi-floor Lockwood Estate was built entirely on sound\nstages at Pinewood Studios. The estate set included Eli Mills' office, Dr.\nWu's large underground laboratory, an underground dinosaur containment\nfacility, separate bedrooms belonging to Benjamin and Maisie Lockwood, and a\nlarge library with dinosaur skeletons and artifacts. When filming was\ncompleted in the Lockwood library, the set was redecorated and converted into\nthe estate's underground garage, where the dinosaur auction takes place.[3]\nPratt stated that the film involved significantly more stunts than its\npredecessor.[3] An improvised fist fight scene, between Owen and several men\nduring the dinosaur auction, was added late in filming. It was the first such\nscene to be featured in the film series, and was filmed in a single continuous\nshot with the use of a [dolly track](/wiki/Tracking_shot \"Tracking shot\").[76]\n\nOn May 10, 2017, it was reported that scenes were being filmed at [Rock\nBarracks](/wiki/Rock_Barracks \"Rock Barracks\") military base, near\n[Woodbridge, Suffolk](/wiki/Woodbridge,_Suffolk \"Woodbridge, Suffolk\").[127]\nOn May 24, 2017, scenes were shot at Hampshire's [Blackbushe\nAirport](/wiki/Blackbushe_Airport \"Blackbushe Airport\"), which stood in as an\nAmerican airfield.[128] Filming in the United Kingdom concluded on June 10,\n2017.[108] Up to that point, Trevorrow was present as an on-set writer for\neach day of production so he could aid Bayona with any possible script\nchanges.[129][130] Goldblum shot his scenes in a single day at Pinewood\nStudios,[131] during the last day of filming in the United Kingdom.[132] Jones\nalso filmed his scenes on large sets at Pinewood Studios.[3]\n\nFilming in Hawaii was underway as of June 13, 2017,[133][134] and lasted more\nthan 25 days, with locations that included [Dillingham\nAirfield](/wiki/Dillingham_Airfield \"Dillingham Airfield\") and Pua'ena\nPoint.[135] On June 21, 2017, filming began at Heʻeia Kea Small Boat Harbor in\n[Heʻeia, Hawaii](/wiki/He%CA%BBeia,_Hawaii \"Heʻeia, Hawaii\"),[136] which\nserved as Isla Nublar's shipping dock.[3] More than half of the harbor was\nclosed for filming, which required the use of [smoke\nmachines](/wiki/Smoke_machine \"Smoke machine\"). Scenes were scheduled to be\nshot at the harbor throughout the end of the month.[136][137] Filming also\ntook place in a nearby Heʻeia jungle for scenes in which Owen searches for and\nlocates Blue.[3] As a reference to the first _Jurassic Park_ film, the scene\nbetween Owen and Blue includes an overturned [Ford\nExplorer](/wiki/Ford_Explorer \"Ford Explorer\"), previously featured in the\noriginal film as a Jurassic Park tour vehicle. Trevorrow had initially\nconsidered including the vehicle in a scene in _Jurassic World_ , before\nsettling on the original Jurassic Park visitor center instead.[138] On June\n22, 2017, the film's official title was announced as _Jurassic World: Fallen\nKingdom_.[139] At the time, filming was underway at [Kualoa\nRanch](/wiki/Kualoa_Ranch \"Kualoa Ranch\") on the Hawaiian island of\n[Oahu](/wiki/Oahu \"Oahu\").[140] Filming at Kualoa Ranch included the exterior\nset for a radio tower bunker.[3]\n\nIn Hawaii, scenes in which characters are running were filmed with the use of\nthe Edge Arm, a [stabilized camera](/wiki/Camera_stabilizer \"Camera\nstabilizer\") that was attached to a crane, which was mounted to a truck that\ndrove alongside the actors. The specialized camera allowed for scenes to be\nshot steadily despite the truck driving over rough terrain.[141] The film\nincludes a scene on Isla Nublar in which Claire and Franklin are riding in a\nball-shaped Jurassic World Gyrosphere ride to evade dinosaurs.[142] The scene\nwas shot at Kualoa Ranch[3] and in England, and Bayona described it as one of\nthe film's biggest challenges.[142] In Hawaii, the Edge Arm was used to film\nthe actors riding in the Gyrosphere as it was hauled on a trailer to simulate\nits movement.[142][141] In England, an outdoor roller coaster track with a\n40-foot drop was constructed for the Gyrosphere, which Howard and Smith rode\nin to shoot a scene in which the ride plummets off a cliff and into the water\nsurrounding Isla Nublar.[142][143] Although this portion of the scene could\nhave been shot with the use of a [green screen](/wiki/Chroma_key \"Chroma\nkey\"), Bayona wanted the actors to have genuine fear for the scene.[143] The\nfinal portion of the scene was shot at Pinewood Studios, where a large indoor\ntank was constructed and filled with water to depict the submerged ride as\nOwen tries to break it open and rescue Claire and Franklin.[142][144] Bayona\nwanted this portion of the scene to have the appearance of a single continuous\nshot; to achieve this, the scene was filmed in five different takes that were\nmerged to make it seem like a single shot.[145] Pratt was aided by a diving\ninstructor for the scene, which also involved Howard and Smith\nunderwater.[142][144] Filming in the tank lasted five days,[3] and required 85\ncrew members.[146] The scene in the tank was primarily shot by a [second\nunit](/wiki/Second_unit \"Second unit\") crew, as Bayona was busy directing\nscenes on other soundstages.[145]\n\n[David Vickery](/wiki/David_Vickery \"David Vickery\") and his team at ILM\ncreated the volcanic special effects and consulted\n[volcanologists](/wiki/Volcanologist \"Volcanologist\") for research. According\nto Vickery, the team inquired \"how a volcano of this type might erupt\" and\nalso requested information about \"the various stages of lava and [pyroclastic\nflow](/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow \"Pyroclastic flow\"). We are speeding it up a bit\nfor the sake of our film, but it is definitely all based on real science.\"[3]\nAll of the lava in the film was created through digital effects, although one\nscene used [cat litter](/wiki/Cat_litter \"Cat litter\") set on fire as a stand-\nin on set, so the actors would know where to react. The scene was set in an\nIsla Nublar bunker as lava begins dripping from the roof. The litter had been\nsoaked in flammable liquid, and was dropped from 12 different nozzles above\nthe set.[143][147]\n\nThe Main Street section of the Jurassic World theme park was rebuilt on\n[Police Beach](/wiki/Papailoa_Beach \"Papailoa Beach\") in Hawaii for a scene in\nwhich Owen and Claire return to the island.[3] The set had previously been\nbuilt in Louisiana for filming of the previous _Jurassic World_ , but was\ndismantled after filming concluded.[138] For the sequel, Nicholson had part of\nthe Main Street practically built, although the park's visitor center could\nnot be constructed in its entirety because of its large size. Unbuilt portions\nof the park were created by ILM using digital set extensions. Main Street was\nthe largest set built in Hawaii, and required more than three months to\ncomplete.[3] Many of the same prop makers returned to recreate the Main Street\nset, which then had to be aged to give the appearance of abandonment.[138]\n\nOn July 7, 2017, filming took place at Oahu's [Hālona\nBlowhole](/wiki/H%C4%81lona_Blowhole \"Hālona Blowhole\"),[148][149] where\nPratt, Howard and Smith shot scenes on a beach.[3] Filming concluded on July\n8, 2017,[150] after shooting was completed at Hālona Blowhole.[151] Bayona\nsaid that making the film was the biggest challenge of his life.[54] The\n[original cut](/wiki/Rough_cut \"Rough cut\") of the film was approximately two\nhours and 45 minutes,[152] which the filmmakers considered too long.[153] The\nfilm was trimmed to two hours and eight minutes for the final cut.[152] One\nscene that was removed from the film would reveal the character of Zia to be a\nlesbian, an idea that came from Bayona and Trevorrow, who chose to cut it out\nfor runtime reasons.[153]\n\n### Creatures on screen\n\nSee also: [List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park\nseries](/wiki/List_of_cloned_animals_in_the_Jurassic_Park_series \"List of\ncloned animals in the Jurassic Park series\")\n\nThe film's dinosaurs were created through a combination of animatronics and\n[computer-generated imagery](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-\ngenerated imagery\") (CGI).[3] Special effects artist [Neal\nScanlan](/wiki/Neal_Scanlan \"Neal Scanlan\") served as the film's creature\neffects creative supervisor,[154] while Vickery and Alex Wuttke served as\n[visual effects supervisors](/wiki/Visual_effects_supervisor \"Visual effects\nsupervisor\").[155] Scanlan worked on the animatronic dinosaurs, while Vickery\nand his ILM team created versions of the dinosaurs through CGI.[154] ILM\nanimators in Vancouver worked on dinosaur stampede scenes, while ILM's London\nstudio created the remaining creature scenes. Approximately 52 ILM animators\nworked on the film.[156] Scanlan worked closely with Bayona and Vickery to\ncreate the creatures,[154] and Vickery and ILM did extensive research to\naccurately create and depict the dinosaurs, which included consulting with\n[paleontologists](/wiki/Paleontologist \"Paleontologist\"). The ILM team also\nreferred to elephants and rhinos to determine how the dinosaurs should move\nand behave.[3] Dinosaur expert John Hankla, of the [Denver Museum of Nature\nand Science](/wiki/Denver_Museum_of_Nature_and_Science \"Denver Museum of\nNature and Science\"), served as an advisor on the film.[157] After reading fan\nthoughts on dinosaurs and speaking with children, Bayona realized that\ndinosaur textures and colors were frequently brought up, and stated, \"I\nthought that was the area where I could play with. They feel somehow a little\nbit more exotic and richer in this movie.\"[154] New research had also\nsuggested that real dinosaurs were more colorful and brighter than previously\nthought.[3]\n\nThe film features more dinosaurs than any previous film in the series,[54] as\nBayona wanted to include several new dinosaurs not previously seen in earlier\nfilms,[154] including _[Allosaurus](/wiki/Allosaurus \"Allosaurus\")_ ,\n_[Baryonyx](/wiki/Baryonyx \"Baryonyx\")_ , _[Carnotaurus](/wiki/Carnotaurus\n\"Carnotaurus\")_ , _[Sinoceratops](/wiki/Sinoceratops \"Sinoceratops\")_ ,\n_[Stygimoloch](/wiki/Stygimoloch \"Stygimoloch\")_ , and the fictional\n_Indoraptor_.[158] _Baryonyx_ and _Carnotaurus_ were among the creatures\ncreated through CGI.[156] _[Dilophosaurus](/wiki/Dilophosaurus\n\"Dilophosaurus\")_ was in the film's original cut, but was removed.[152] The\nfilm features more animatronic dinosaurs than any previous sequel,[159][160]\nand the animatronics used were more technologically advanced than in the\nprevious films.[159] Five animatronic dinosaurs were created for the film,\nwhereas the previous film only featured one.[3] More animatronics were used\nbecause the film features closer interaction between humans and dinosaurs than\nits predecessor, including a scene in which Howard rode atop the sedated _T.\nrex_.[3][161] Bayona stated that animatronics \"are very helpful on set,\nespecially for the actors so they have something to perform against. There's\nan extra excitement if they can act in front of something real.\"[154] Scanlan\nstated that animatronics were not best for every scene: \"In some ways it will\nhave an impact on your shooting schedule; you have to take time to film with\nan animatronic. In the balance, we ask ourselves if it is economically and\nartistically more valuable to do it that way, or as a post-production effect.\nOnce we have looked at each particular case, with the director and the VFX\nsupervisor we decide whether—because of the environment or the\ncircumstances—it is the right way to go practically.\"[3]\n\nScanlan spent more than eight months at Pinewood Studios to work on the\ncreatures before and during filming, with a crew of approximately 35\npeople.[162] Scanlan's team created functional animatronic models of the _T.\nrex_ , the _Indoraptor_ and Blue, while ILM worked on CGI versions of the\ncreatures.[154][156]\n\n  * The _T. rex_ was one of the first animatronic creatures needed for filming, in the form of a full-scale head and shoulders. ILM sent Scanlan a model of the _T. rex_ from its appearance in _Jurassic World_ , and Scanlan used it to create a full-scale [3D print](/wiki/3D_printing \"3D printing\") of the _T. rex_ head and shoulders.[3] The life-sized _T. rex_ animatronic was controlled through joysticks, with the ability to breathe and move its head.[159] The _T. rex_ animatronic was used for a scene in which the sedated creature is inside a cage while Owen and Claire attempt to retrieve blood from it. The beginning shots in the scene were created using only the animatronic, while the ending shots solely used CGI, with the middle portion of the scene using a combination of the two methods.[156] Within the film's story, the _T. rex_ is portrayed as the same individual featured in previous films.[163] Trevorrow said, \"We've been following this same character since the beginning; she's the same _T. rex_ that was in _Jurassic Park_ and in _Jurassic World_. She is iconic—not just because she's a _T. rex_ , but because she's _this T. rex_.\"[3]\n  * The Blue animatronic was created to lay down on an operating table, depicting the animal in an injured state while the character of Zia operates on the creature. Up to 12 [puppeteers](/wiki/Puppeteer \"Puppeteer\"), hidden under the operating table, were needed to control the animatronic during filming.[3] The scene was shot twice, with and without the Blue animatronic, and the two versions were later combined for a seamless effect.[76] In creating Blue through CGI, the animators referred to the animal's appearance in the previous film.[156] According to Vickery, Blue's movements were designed to resemble a dog: \"You look at the way Blue cocks her head and looks up at you. It's exactly like a dog. You're trying to sort of connect the dinosaur with things that you understand as a human.\"[155]\n  * The _Indoraptor_ was primarily created through CGI, while a practical head, neck, shoulders, foot and arm were created for close-up shots.[157] For some scenes, an inflatable dinosaur was operated by two puppeteers as a _Indoraptor_ stand-in on set, while a CGI version of the creature would be added in later.[143] The _Indoraptor_ was designed to have long human-like arms,[76] and the creature is depicted as a [quadruped](/wiki/Quadruped \"Quadruped\") and [biped](/wiki/Biped \"Biped\"),[156] with a height of approximately 10 feet tall while standing on two legs.[3] The _Indoraptor '_s black color was chosen as Bayona wanted the creature to have the appearance of a black shadow, stating that \"it's very terrifying when you see the Indoraptor in the dark because you can only see the eyes and the teeth.\"[76]\n\nScanlan's team also made puppeteering aids, [rod puppets](/wiki/Rod_puppet\n\"Rod puppet\"), and several prop dinosaurs, all created in coordination with\nVickery to ensure a consistent result between the practical effects and\nCGI.[154] Animal motions that could not be perfected with puppetry, such as\nblinking, were instead created with computer technology.[3] Among the\npuppeteer dinosaurs were baby velociraptors, which were used for a scene with\nPratt,[162] while the final, wider shots of the scene used two-wheeled,\nremote-controlled toys to stand-in for the baby raptors on set. The toys\nincluded a spring which gave them the ability to jump, and the feature was\nused to get a genuinely startled reaction from Pratt.[143] Although [motion\ncapture](/wiki/Motion_capture \"Motion capture\") was used in the previous film\nto depict velociraptors, ILM determined after several tests that the\ntechnology would not be adequate for depicting dinosaurs in _Jurassic World:\nFallen Kingdom_ , and the team chose instead to use [key\nframe](/wiki/Key_frame \"Key frame\") animation done for the previous films.\nHowever, some motion capture was done as a form of\n[previsualization](/wiki/Previsualization \"Previsualization\") to aid\nBayona.[156] ILM used key framing to create scenes involving a large number of\ndinosaurs, and referred to [high-speed photography](/wiki/High-\nspeed_photography \"High-speed photography\") of horses racing for aid in\ncreating such scenes.[156]\n\nThe fight scene between Blue and the _Indoraptor_ , set in Maisie's bedroom,\nwas designed in London and key framed by ILM. Jance Rubinchik, animation\nsupervisor for ILM, stated that the fight was the \"trickiest sequence\" because\nof the lack of previsualization.[156] According to Bayona, a\n_[Brachiosaurus](/wiki/Brachiosaurus \"Brachiosaurus\")_ that is shown dying in\nthe volcanic eruption is meant to be the same individual that is first seen in\nthe original _Jurassic Park_. The _Brachiosaurus_ in the new film was created\nusing the same animations from the 1993 film. The dinosaur's death was the\nlast shot on the entire film to be finished; Bayona and the post-production\nteam stayed up through the night to perfect the scene's colors and\ncomposition, shortly before the film's release.[76]\n\nFor advice on veterinary procedures and animatronic movements, the filmmakers\nsought a veterinary surgeon who had experience with [African\nwildlife](/wiki/Fauna_of_Africa \"Fauna of Africa\"). Jonathan Cranston, a\n[Gloucestershire](/wiki/Gloucestershire \"Gloucestershire\") veterinary surgeon,\nwas recommended for the position because of his experience with wildlife in\n[South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\"). Cranston advised Bayona and\nthe producers on how to choreograph several scenes to accurately depict\ncomplex veterinarian procedures that involved the dinosaurs. Cranston also\nworked closely with Pratt, Howard, Pineda and Smith to teach them how to\nperform such procedures. Additionally, Cranston advised the puppeteers on\ncreating subtle and authentic animal movements, and also worked with Bayona on\ntwo scenes. Cranston was on set for 12 days, primarily at Pinewood\nStudios.[164]\n\n## Marketing\n\nA six-second clip from the film was released on November 22, 2017.[165][166]\nThe first trailer was teased for release on November 30, 2017, but this was\nlater confirmed to be incorrect.[167] Several [teaser\ntrailers](/wiki/Teaser_trailer \"Teaser trailer\") and a behind-the-scenes\n[featurette](/wiki/Featurette \"Featurette\") of the film were released in early\nDecember 2017,[168][169][170][171] prior to the release of a full-length\ntrailer on December 7.[23][168] That month,[172] Universal launched a website\nfor the Dinosaur Protection Group that ultimately included miscellaneous\ninformation about the group and its effort to save the island's dinosaurs,[14]\nas well as a video featuring Howard, Pineda and Smith as their\ncharacters.[173] The website was created by Timothy Glover and Jack Anthony\nEwins, who previously created the [Masrani Global\nwebsite](/wiki/Jurassic_World#Marketing_and_promotion \"Jurassic World\") for\n_Jurassic World_.[174] A second trailer aired during [Super Bowl\nLII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_LII \"Super Bowl LII\") on February 4, 2018.[175][176] A\n30-second teaser trailer was released on April 13, 2018, announcing the\nrelease of a third full trailer on April 18.[177][178] Several of the trailers\nand commercials for the film included scenes from the ending that depict the\n_Tyrannosaurus rex_ and the _Mosasaurus_ now loose in the world, which\nfrustrated Trevorrow, who preferred not to show such scenes prior to the\nfilm's release.[77][179]\n\nUniversal spent $185 million on partners for a global marketing campaign, more\nthan double the cost of the previous film's partner program.[180] The campaign\nincluded nine partners which aired television commercials and sold products to\npromote the film. The partners were [Dairy Queen](/wiki/Dairy_Queen \"Dairy\nQueen\"), [Doritos](/wiki/Doritos \"Doritos\"), [Dr Pepper](/wiki/Dr_Pepper \"Dr\nPepper\"), [Ferrero SpA](/wiki/Ferrero_SpA \"Ferrero SpA\"), [Jeep](/wiki/Jeep\n\"Jeep\"), [Juicy Fruit](/wiki/Juicy_Fruit \"Juicy Fruit\"),\n[Kellogg's](/wiki/Kellogg%27s \"Kellogg's\"), [M&M's](/wiki/M%26M%27s \"M&M's\"),\nand [Skittles](/wiki/Skittles_\\(confectionery\\) \"Skittles\n\\(confectionery\\)\").[180] The global marketing campaign consisted of 1.3\nbillion items to promote the film, including 100 million boxes of Kellogg's\nproducts and 15 million packages of [Kinder Joy](/wiki/Kinder_Joy \"Kinder\nJoy\") candy by Ferrero.[180] Dairy Queen, a returning partner from the\nprevious film, sold \"Jurassic Chomp\" ice cream desserts in collectable cups,\nwhile Doritos and Dr Pepper marketed versions of their products that featured\nimages of the film's dinosaurs.[180][181] For Super Bowl LII, Trevorrow\ndirected a Jeep commercial starring Goldblum and featuring a _T. rex_. Within\n24 hours of its release, the commercial received 39.7 million online views,\nwhich was more than any film trailer that was watched online following its\nSuper Bowl LII television debut.[180] Universal also teamed up with\n[Amazon](/wiki/Amazon_\\(company\\) \"Amazon \\(company\\)\") for a marketing stunt\nin which a large dinosaur-sized box was driven around Los Angeles on a truck\nto promote the film.[182][183]\n\nLicensing partners included [Mattel](/wiki/Mattel \"Mattel\"), [Lego](/wiki/Lego\n\"Lego\"), and [Funko](/wiki/Funko \"Funko\"), all of which created toys based on\nthe film.[184][185][186][187] Mattel produced a variety of toys,[188]\nincluding dinosaurs and action figures,[189][190] as well as\n[Barbie](/wiki/Barbie \"Barbie\") dolls featuring the likeness of Pratt and\nHoward as their characters.[185] A [mobile app](/wiki/Mobile_app \"Mobile app\")\ntitled _Jurassic World Facts_ was released as a [tie-in](/wiki/Tie-in \"Tie-\nin\") to Mattel's dinosaur toys, which included symbols that could be scanned\nto collect facts about each creature.[190] Lego is expected to release 13 Lego\nsets based on the film.[186] A video game, _[Jurassic World\nEvolution](/wiki/Jurassic_World_Evolution \"Jurassic World Evolution\")_ , was\nreleased simultaneously with the film.[191] A two-part [virtual\nreality](/wiki/Virtual_reality \"Virtual reality\") miniseries titled _Jurassic\nWorld: Blue_ was released for [Oculus VR headsets](/wiki/Oculus_VR#Products\n\"Oculus VR\") as a film tie-in. It was created by Felix & Paul Studios and\nIndustrial Light and Magic, and features Blue on Isla Nublar at the time of\nthe volcanic eruption.[192][193][194][195] A website and campaign for\n\"Extinction Now!\", the antithesis to the Dinosaur Protection Group, was\ncreated by Trevorrow, Glover and Ewins, and was launched shortly before the\nfilm's release.[174] The campaign included a [found-\nfootage](/wiki/Found_footage_\\(film_technique\\) \"Found footage \\(film\ntechnique\\)\") clip of a _Tyrannosaurus_ loose in San Diego, a reference to\n_[The Lost World: Jurassic Park](/wiki/The_Lost_World:_Jurassic_Park \"The Lost\nWorld: Jurassic Park\")_.[174][196]\n\n## Release\n\n_Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ had its premiere at the [WiZink\nCenter](/wiki/WiZink_Center \"WiZink Center\") in [Madrid](/wiki/Madrid\n\"Madrid\"), Spain, on May 21, 2018.[197][198] The international theatrical\nrelease began on June 6,[199] with the film being released in Singapore and\nMalaysia on June 7,[200][201] in the United Kingdom, India, Italy, South Korea\nand Angola on June 8,[202] and in Pakistan on June 16, 2018. The film was\nreleased in the United States on June 22, 2018.[11][84]\n\n### Home media\n\n_Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ is scheduled for digital release on September\n4, 2018 and [Blu-ray](/wiki/Blu-ray \"Blu-ray\"), [DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\"), [Blu-\nray 3D](/wiki/Blu-ray_3D \"Blu-ray 3D\") and [4K Blu-ray](/wiki/4K_Blu-ray \"4K\nBlu-ray\") on September 18, 2018.[203]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nAs of August 12,\n2018[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jurassic_World:_Fallen_Kingdom&action=edit),\n_Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ has grossed $409.6 million in the United\nStates and Canada and $866.8 million in other territories for a total\nworldwide gross of $1.276 billion, against a production budget in the range of\n$170–187 million.[7]\n\nThe film crossed the $1 billion mark on July 5, 2018, becoming the 35th film\nall-time to make the milestone, and seventh for Universal. It also made\nUniversal the second studio (behind Disney) to have at least two films in\nthree different franchises make $1 billion worldwide, alongside _[The Fast and\nthe Furious](/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious \"The Fast and the Furious\")_ and\n_[Despicable Me](/wiki/Despicable_Me_\\(franchise\\) \"Despicable Me\n\\(franchise\\)\")_.[204]\n\n#### United States and Canada\n\nIn December 2017, a survey from [Fandango](/wiki/Fandango_\\(company\\)\n\"Fandango \\(company\\)\") indicated that _Fallen Kingdom_ was one of the most\nanticipated films of 2018.[205] Initial projections three weeks before its\nrelease had the film grossing between $130–150 million in its opening weekend\nin the United States and Canada, with [_BoxOffice_\nmagazine](/wiki/BoxOffice_\\(magazine\\) \"BoxOffice \\(magazine\\)\") estimating a\ntotal of $325–380 million for its final domestic gross.[206][207] By the week\nof its release, the low-end of projections had reached $135 million.[6] It was\nreleased on June 22, 2018, in 4,475 theaters (the second-widest release ever\nbehind _[Despicable Me 3](/wiki/Despicable_Me_3 \"Despicable Me 3\")_) grossing\n$58.7 million on its opening day, the second-highest of the franchise and\n28th-best on record.[208] The film grossed $15.3 million from Thursday night\npreviews at 3,600 theaters, down from the $18.5 million grossed by _Jurassic\nWorld_. It ended up debuting to $148 million, the 20th-best opening weekend of\nall-time and second highest for Universal. It also marked the first time two\nfilms opened to over $100 million in back-to-back weekends, following the\n_[Incredibles 2](/wiki/Incredibles_2 \"Incredibles 2\")_ 's $182.7 million debut\nthe week before.[208][209] In its second weekend the film made $60 million, a\ndrop of 59% and less than the $105.8 million made by _Jurassic World_ in its\nsophomore weekend, and in its third weekend made $28.3 million.[210][211]\n\n#### Outside North America\n\nOverseas, the film was released in 48 countries between June 6 and June 8,\n2018, including France, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Italy,\nRussia, and Spain, and was projected to gross $130–145 million in its opening\nweekend.[212] It made $20.2 million on its first day, including $1.4 million\nin France and $1 million in Indonesia. In South Korea, it grossed $9.7 million\n([₩](/wiki/South_Korean_won \"South Korean won\")10.3 billion) and sold over 1\nmillion tickets, setting opening day records for both (beating _[The\nMummy](/wiki/The_Mummy_\\(2017_film\\) \"The Mummy \\(2017 film\\)\")_ 's ₩7.4\nbillion and _[Avengers: Infinity War](/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War \"Avengers:\nInfinity War\")_ 's 980,000, respectively).[213] It went on to have an\ninternational debut of $151.1 million, including $8 million from IMAX\nscreenings. Its largest opening markets were South Korea ($27.2 million), the\nUK ($19.9 million), France ($10 million), Spain ($9.5 million) and Germany\n($9.1 million).[214] In China, the film was released on June 15 and made $34.4\nmillion ([¥](/wiki/Renminbi \"Renminbi\")220 million) on its opening day, nearly\ndouble the first day total of its predecessor ($17.5 million).[215] It went on\nto open to $111.9 million (¥715 million), the fourth best-ever in the country\nfor a Hollywood release (behind _[The Fate of the\nFurious](/wiki/The_Fate_of_the_Furious \"The Fate of the Furious\")_ ,\n_Avengers: Infinity War_ and _[Transformers: The Last\nKnight](/wiki/Transformers:_The_Last_Knight \"Transformers: The Last\nKnight\")_), and bringing the film's two week international total to $372.1\nmillion, more than the entire lifetime gross of _[Jurassic Park\nIII](/wiki/Jurassic_Park_III \"Jurassic Park III\")_ ($368 million).[216] In its\nthird week of international release the film made $106.7 million, bringing its\ntotal to $561.5 million. China remained one of the top markets with $32.4\nmillion (a standard 71% drop for Hollywood films in the country), while it was\nalso released in Mexico ($12.3 million), Brazil ($9.2 million) and Australia\n$7.9 million).[217] As of July 5, 2018, the film has grossed $245.5 million in\nChina, making it the 5th highest grossing Hollywood film of all-time in the\ncountry.[204]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregation website [Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten\nTomatoes\"), _Fallen Kingdom_ holds an approval rating of 51% based on 311\nreviews, and an average rating of 5.7/10.
