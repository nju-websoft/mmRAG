Maj. Gen.\n[Ulysses S. Grant](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S. Grant\") was given\ncommand of Union forces in the\n[West](/wiki/Western_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Western Theater of the\nAmerican Civil War\"), now consolidated under the [Division of the\nMississippi](/wiki/Military_Division_of_the_Mississippi \"Military Division of\nthe Mississippi\"). Significant reinforcements also began to arrive with him in\nChattanooga from Mississippi and the [Eastern\nTheater](/wiki/Eastern_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Eastern Theater of\nthe American Civil War\"). On October 19, Grant removed Rosecrans from command\nof the Army of the Cumberland and replaced him with Major General [George\nHenry Thomas](/wiki/George_Henry_Thomas \"George Henry Thomas\").\n\nAfter opening a supply line (the \"Cracker Line\") to feed his starving men and\nanimals, Grant's army fought off a Confederate counterattack at the [Battle of\nWauhatchie](/wiki/Battle_of_Wauhatchie \"Battle of Wauhatchie\") on October\n28–29, 1863. On November 23, the Army of the Cumberland advanced from the\nfortifications around Chattanooga to seize the minor high ground at Orchard\nKnob while elements of the Union [Army of the\nTennessee](/wiki/Army_of_the_Tennessee \"Army of the Tennessee\") under Maj.\nGen. [William Tecumseh Sherman](/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman \"William\nTecumseh Sherman\") maneuvered to launch a surprise attack against Bragg's\nright flank on [Missionary Ridge](/wiki/Battle_of_Missionary_Ridge \"Battle of\nMissionary Ridge\"). On November 24, Sherman's men crossed the [Tennessee\nRiver](/wiki/Tennessee_River \"Tennessee River\") in the morning and then\nadvanced to occupy high ground at the northern end of Missionary Ridge in the\nafternoon. The same day, Eastern Theater troops under Maj. Gen. [Joseph\nHooker](/wiki/Joseph_Hooker \"Joseph Hooker\") defeated the Confederates in the\n[Battle of Lookout Mountain](/wiki/Battle_of_Lookout_Mountain \"Battle of\nLookout Mountain\"). The next day they began a movement toward Bragg's left\nflank at [Rossville](/wiki/Rossville,_Georgia \"Rossville, Georgia\").\n\nOn November 25, Sherman's attack on Bragg's right flank made little progress.\nHoping to distract Bragg's attention, Grant ordered Thomas's army to advance\nin the center of his line to the base of Missionary Ridge. A combination of\nmisunderstood orders and the pressure of the tactical situation caused\nThomas's men to surge to the top of Missionary Ridge, routing the Army of\nTennessee, which retreated to [Dalton, Georgia](/wiki/Dalton,_Georgia \"Dalton,\nGeorgia\"), fighting off the Union pursuit successfully at the [Battle of\nRinggold Gap](/wiki/Battle_of_Ringgold_Gap \"Battle of Ringgold Gap\").

In September 1863, the Union [Army of the\nCumberland](/wiki/Army_of_the_Cumberland \"Army of the Cumberland\") under Maj.\nGen. [William S. Rosecrans](/wiki/William_S._Rosecrans \"William S. Rosecrans\")\nexecuted a series of maneuvers that forced Confederate Gen. [Braxton\nBragg](/wiki/Braxton_Bragg \"Braxton Bragg\") and his [Army of\nTennessee](/wiki/Army_of_Tennessee \"Army of Tennessee\") to abandon Chattanooga\nand withdraw into northern [Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_\\(U.S._State\\) \"Georgia\n\\(U.S. State\\)\"). Rosecrans pursued Bragg and the two armies collided at the\n[Battle of Chickamauga](/wiki/Battle_of_Chickamauga \"Battle of Chickamauga\")\non September 19–20. Bragg achieved a major victory when a gap was opened\nmistakenly in the Union line and a strong assaulting force commanded by [Lt.\nGen.](/wiki/Lieutenant_General_\\(CSA\\) \"Lieutenant General \\(CSA\\)\") [James\nLongstreet](/wiki/James_Longstreet \"James Longstreet\") drove through it and\nrouted a good portion of the Union army. A determined defensive stand by Maj.\nGen. [George H. Thomas](/wiki/George_H._Thomas \"George H. Thomas\") on\nSnodgrass Hill saved the army from total destruction, earning him the nickname\n\"Rock of Chickamauga\" and allowing time for most of Rosecrans's army to\nretreat to Chattanooga. Bragg did not cut off the escape routes to Chattanooga\nand did not organize a pursuit that might have seriously damaged the Union\narmy before it could regroup and prepare its defenses in the city. The Union\nforces took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive\npositions in a tight, 3-mile-long semicircle around the city.[8]\n\nBragg had three courses of action. He could outflank Rosecrans by crossing the\nTennessee either below or above the city, assault the Union force directly in\ntheir fortifications, or starve the Federals by establishing a siege line. The\nflanking option was deemed to be impracticable because Bragg's army was short\non ammunition, they had no pontoons for river crossing, and Longstreet's corps\nfrom Virginia had arrived at Chickamauga without wagons. A direct assault was\ntoo costly against a well-fortified enemy. Receiving intelligence that\nRosecrans's men had only six days of rations, Bragg chose the siege option,\nwhile attempting to accumulate sufficient logistical capability to cross the\nTennessee.[9]\n\nBragg's army besieged the city, threatening to starve the Union forces into\nsurrender. The Confederates established themselves on [Missionary\nRidge](/wiki/Missionary_Ridge \"Missionary Ridge\") and [Lookout\nMountain](/wiki/Lookout_Mountain \"Lookout Mountain\"), both of which had\nexcellent views of the city, the Tennessee River flowing north of the city,\nand the Union's supply lines. Bragg also had little inclination to take\noffensive action against the Federal army because he was occupied in\nleadership quarrels within his army. On September 29, Bragg relieved from\ncommand two of his subordinates who had disappointed him in the Chickamauga\nCampaign: Maj. Gen. [Thomas C. Hindman](/wiki/Thomas_C._Hindman \"Thomas C.\nHindman\") (who had failed to destroy part of the Union army at [McLemore's\nCove](/wiki/Battle_of_Chickamauga#Davis's_Cross_Roads \"Battle of\nChickamauga\")) and Lt. Gen. [Leonidas Polk](/wiki/Leonidas_Polk \"Leonidas\nPolk\") (who had delayed attacking on September 20 of Chickamauga). On October\n4, twelve of his most senior generals sent a petition to [Confederate\nPresident](/wiki/President_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America \"President of\nthe Confederate States of America\") [Jefferson Davis](/wiki/Jefferson_Davis\n\"Jefferson Davis\"), demanding that Bragg be relieved of command. Davis\npersonally visited Chattanooga to hear the complaints. After he decided to\nretain Bragg in command, Bragg retaliated against some of those generals by\nrelieving Lt. Gen. [D.H. Hill](/wiki/D.H._Hill \"D.H. Hill\") and Maj. Gen.\n[Simon B. Buckner](/wiki/Simon_Bolivar_Buckner,_Sr. \"Simon Bolivar Buckner,\nSr.\").[10]\n\nNever in the history of the Army of the Cumberland had the spirit of its\nofficers and men been more depressed. The battle of Chickamauga had not only\nbeen fought and lost, but we also lost what was more than losing the battle.\nWe had lost confidence in our commander.\n\nCapt. George Lewis, 124th Ohio[11]\n\nIn Chattanooga, Rosecrans was stunned by the defeat of his army and became\npsychologically unable to take decisive action to lift the siege.[12]\nPresident [Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\") remarked\nthat Rosecrans seemed \"confused and stunned like a duck hit on the head.\"[13]\nUnion soldiers began to feel the effect of extremely short rations and many of\ntheir horses and mules died. The only supply line that was not controlled by\nthe Confederates was a roundabout, tortuous course nearly 60 miles long over\nWalden's Ridge from [Bridgeport, Alabama](/wiki/Bridgeport,_Alabama\n\"Bridgeport, Alabama\"). Heavy rains began to fall in late September, washing\naway long stretches of the mountain roads. On October 1, Maj. Gen. [Joseph\nWheeler](/wiki/Joseph_Wheeler \"Joseph Wheeler\")'s Confederate cavalry\nintercepted and severely damaged a train of 800 wagons—burning hundreds of the\nwagons, and shooting or sabering hundreds of mules—at the start of his\n[October 1863 Raid](/wiki/Wheeler%27s_October_1863_Raid \"Wheeler's October\n1863 Raid\") through Tennessee to sever Rosecrans's supply line. Toward the end\nof October, typical Federal soldiers' rations were \"four cakes of hard bread\nand a quarter pound of pork\" every three days.[14]\n\nThe Union high command began immediate preparations to relieve the city. Only\nhours after the defeat at Chickamauga, [Secretary of\nWar](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War \"United States Secretary of War\")\n[Edwin M. Stanton](/wiki/Edwin_M._Stanton \"Edwin M. Stanton\") ordered Maj.\nGen. [Joseph Hooker](/wiki/Joseph_Hooker \"Joseph Hooker\") to Chattanooga with\n15,000 men in two small corps from the [Army of the\nPotomac](/wiki/Army_of_the_Potomac \"Army of the Potomac\") in Virginia. Maj.\nGen. [Ulysses S. Grant](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S. Grant\") was ordered\nto send 20,000 men under his chief subordinate Maj. Gen. [William T.\nSherman](/wiki/William_T._Sherman \"William T. Sherman\"), from [Vicksburg,\nMississippi](/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi \"Vicksburg, Mississippi\"). On\nSeptember 29, Stanton ordered Grant to go to Chattanooga himself,[15] as\ncommander of the newly created [Military Division of the\nMississippi](/wiki/Military_Division_of_the_Mississippi \"Military Division of\nthe Mississippi\"), bringing all of the territory from the [Appalachian\nMountains](/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains \"Appalachian Mountains\") to the\n[Mississippi River](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\") (and much of\nthe state of [Arkansas](/wiki/Arkansas \"Arkansas\")) under a single commander\nfor the first time. Grant was given the option of replacing the demoralized\nRosecrans with Thomas. Although Grant did not have good personal relations\nwith Thomas, he heartily disliked Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the\nArmy of the Cumberland. Hearing an inaccurate report that Rosecrans was\npreparing to abandon Chattanooga, Grant telegraphed to Thomas, \"Hold\nChattanooga at all hazards. I will be there as soon as possible.\" The Rock of\nChickamauga replied immediately, \"We will hold the town till we starve.\" Grant\ntraveled over the treacherous mountain supply line roads and arrived in\nChattanooga on October 23.[16]\n\n### Reopening the Tennessee\nRiver[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Reopening the Tennessee River\")]\n\n#### Opening the Cracker\nLine[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Opening the Cracker Line\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/Chattanooga_region_panorama_Battles_and_Leaders.jpg/660px-\nChattanooga_region_panorama_Battles_and_Leaders.jpg)](/wiki/File:Chattanooga_region_panorama_Battles_and_Leaders.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chattanooga_region_panorama_Battles_and_Leaders.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nEngraving of the view north from Point Lookout on Lookout Mountain over the\nChattanooga region, from _Battles and Leaders_ , 1885\n\nThe chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland, [Brig.\nGen.](/wiki/Brigadier_general_\\(United_States\\) \"Brigadier general \\(United\nStates\\)\") [William F. \"Baldy\" Smith](/wiki/William_Farrar_Smith \"William\nFarrar Smith\"), had devised a plan with Rosecrans to open a more reliable\nsupply line to the troops in Chattanooga. General Thomas put the plan afoot\nimmediately upon taking command. Smith briefed Grant immediately after the new\ncommander's arrival and Grant enthusiastically concurred with the plan.\nBrown's Ferry crossed the Tennessee River from Moccasin Point where the road\nfollowed a gap through the foothills, turned south through Lookout Valley to\nWauhatchie Station, and then west to Kelley's Ferry, a navigable point on the\nTennessee that could be reached by Union supply boats. If the Army of the\nCumberland could seize Brown's Ferry and link up with Hooker's force arriving\nfrom [Bridgeport, Alabama](/wiki/Bridgeport,_Alabama \"Bridgeport, Alabama\"),\nthrough the Lookout Valley, a reliable, efficient supply line—soon to become\nknown as the \"Cracker Line\"—would be open. And a force at Brown's Ferry would\nthreaten the right flank of any Confederate movement into the valley.[17]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Hazen%27s_men_landing_at_Brown%27s_Ferry.jpg/220px-\nHazen%27s_men_landing_at_Brown%27s_Ferry.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hazen%27s_men_landing_at_Brown%27s_Ferry.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hazen%27s_men_landing_at_Brown%27s_Ferry.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nHazen's men land at Brown's Ferry\n\nHooker left Maj. Gen. [Henry W. Slocum](/wiki/Henry_W._Slocum \"Henry W.\nSlocum\") with one of his divisions of the XII Corps to guard the railroad line\nfrom [Murfreesboro](/wiki/Murfreesboro,_Tennessee \"Murfreesboro, Tennessee\"),\nto Bridgeport. Slocum's remaining division, under Brig. Gen. [John W.\nGeary](/wiki/John_W._Geary \"John W. Geary\"), and the two divisions of Maj.\nGen. Oliver O. Howard's XI Corps were ordered to move quickly to Lookout\nValley. However, weather conditions delayed the movement, so Grant decided to\nmove ahead with the Brown's Ferry operation even before Hooker could arrive.\nSmith's plan for the assault on Brown's Ferry was to send most of one brigade\n(Brig. Gen. [William B. Hazen](/wiki/William_B._Hazen \"William B. Hazen\")'s)\ntraveling stealthily downriver on pontoons and a raft at night to capture the\ngap and hills on the west bank of the Tennessee while a second brigade (Brig.\nGen. [John B. Turchin](/wiki/John_B._Turchin \"John B. Turchin\")'s) marched\nacross Moccasin Point in support.[18]\n\nBraxton Bragg had no idea that this operation was being planned, but he was\naware of Hooker's pending river crossing at Bridgeport, so was concerned about\nhis left flank. He ordered Longstreet to move additional units into Lookout\nValley, but, unknown to Bragg, the order was ignored. Furthermore,\nLongstreet's lack of diligence allowed command mixups to leave only two\nregiments near Brown's Ferry.[19]\n\nEarly on the morning of October 27, Hazen's men floated unnoticed past the\nConfederate position on Lookout Mountain, aided by low fog and no moonlight.\nThey were able to seize the ground above Brown's Ferry by 4:40 a.m. A\ncounterattack by the [15th Alabama](/wiki/15th_Regiment_Alabama_Infantry \"15th\nRegiment Alabama Infantry\") Infantry, commanded by Col. [William C.\nOates](/wiki/William_C._Oates \"William C. Oates\") (of [Little Round\nTop](/wiki/Little_Round_Top \"Little Round Top\") fame) was repulsed and Oates\nwas wounded. Oates's brigade commander, Brig. Gen. [Evander M.\nLaw](/wiki/Evander_M._Law \"Evander M. Law\"), placed his brigade blocking the\nroad over Lookout Mountain and reported the Union success to Longstreet.\nLongstreet dismissed the importance of the report, considering the Union move\nto be only a feint, and did not bother passing the information on to Bragg.\nWhen Bragg learned of it, he ordered Longstreet to retake the ground\nimmediately, but Longstreet once again did nothing and Smith's men spent the\nday consolidating their bridgehead without interference.[20]\n\nHooker's column marched through Lookout Valley and linked up with Hazen and\nTurchin at Brown's Ferry at 3:45 p.m., October 28. Thomas's staff began the\npreparations to bring supplies over the Cracker Line and he telegraphed\nGeneral in Chief [Henry W. Halleck](/wiki/Henry_W._Halleck \"Henry W.

There, Hooker had neglected to arrange his force into effective\ndefensive positions, instructing them merely to find good cover for the troops\nand bivouac. He detached Brig. Gen. [John W. Geary](/wiki/John_W._Geary \"John\nW. Geary\")'s division at Wauhatchie Station, a stop on the [Nashville and\nChattanooga Railroad](/wiki/Nashville_and_Chattanooga_Railroad \"Nashville and\nChattanooga Railroad\"), to protect the line of communications to the south as\nwell as the road west to Kelley's Ferry. Longstreet was amazed to see Geary's\nbivouacking soldiers with their large wagon train parked directly in front of\nhim.[22]\n\nLongstreet ordered a night attack, a relatively rare occurrence in the Civil\nWar,[23] using only the brigade of Brig. Gen. [Evander M.\nLaw](/wiki/Evander_M._Law \"Evander M. Law\") and Brig. Gen. [Micah\nJenkins](/wiki/Micah_Jenkins \"Micah Jenkins\")'s division from Lookout\nMountain, far fewer troops than Bragg had authorized. The attack was scheduled\nfor 10:00 p.m. on October 28, but confusion delayed it until midnight.\nAlthough Geary and his officers expected an attack and had thrown out pickets,\nits suddenness took them by surprise. Enveloped from the north by Col. [John\nBratton](/wiki/John_Bratton \"John Bratton\")'s brigade, the Union defenders\nformed into a V-shaped battle line, facing north and east. Geary's son Edward,\nan artillery lieutenant, was killed in the battle, dying in his father's\narms.[24]\n\nHearing the sounds of battle, Hooker, at Brown's Ferry, sent Maj. Gen. [Oliver\nO. Howard](/wiki/Oliver_O._Howard \"Oliver O. Howard\") with two XI Corps\ndivisions as reinforcements. Orders of march were confused and delayed the\nmovement. Hooker mistakenly deployed units from both XI Corps divisions\nagainst Law's and Brig. Gen. [Henry L. Benning](/wiki/Henry_L._Benning \"Henry\nL. Benning\")'s brigades, leaving no one to go to Geary's aid. Law's 2,000 men\nwere greatly outnumbered by Hooker's men, but the hilltop position was\nnaturally strong and several vigorous Union assaults were repulsed.[25]\n\nReceiving an erroneous report that Bratton was retreating, Law decided to pull\nback. Just as his men left their entrenchments, Col. [Orland\nSmith](/wiki/Orland_Smith \"Orland Smith\")'s brigade (Brig. Gen. [Adolph von\nSteinwehr](/wiki/Adolph_von_Steinwehr \"Adolph von Steinwehr\")'s division)\nspilled over them, capturing some stragglers and scattering a regiment that\nfailed to get the order to retreat. Meanwhile, Hooker agreed to let Howard\nproceed to Wauhatchie with some cavalry. Geary's men continued to hold fast,\nalthough they began to run low on ammunition. Just as Bratton began to sense\nvictory, he received a note from Jenkins to retreat because Union\nreinforcements were arriving at his rear. He withdrew to Lookout Mountain,\nsuccessfully covered by Benning's brigade.[26]\n\nBoth sides had planned poorly for the battle. Hooker's carelessness in placing\nhis men had left them at risk. Grant was disgusted at Hooker's performance and\nconsidered relieving him. Longstreet committed too few men for an assault of\nthis importance and Bragg was also disgusted with his subordinate. Bragg's\nbiographer, Judith L. Hallock, wrote that Wauhatchie was, for Longstreet, an\n\"ill-conceived, ill-planned, and poorly coordinated attack\" that \"resulted in\na shambles.\"[27]\n\n#### Longstreet\ndeparts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Longstreet departs\")]\n\nBragg had committed the most egregious error of his checkered career. In all\ntoo typical fashion, he had allowed rancor to crowd out rational thought.\nWithout a coherent plan or even the desire for close coordination between the\ntwo segments, he had divided his army in the face of a now numerically\nsuperior foe who was about to receive even more reinforcements.\n\nThe view of Peter Cozzens, _The Shipwreck of Their Hopes_[28]\n\nThe opening of the cracker line changed the strategic situation completely.\nBragg knew the siege was effectively broken. Considering his\noptions—retreating from the area; assaulting the Union fortifications at\nChattanooga; waiting for Grant to attack; attempting to move around Grant's\nright flank; attempting to move around Grant's left flank—Bragg realized that\nmovement around Grant's left flank was the only promising option. It would\npotentially allow him to re-establish an additional badly needed rail supply\nline (to Virginia via Knoxville) and join forces with about 10,000 men\noperating in southwestern Virginia under the command of Maj. Gen. [Samuel\nJones](/wiki/Sam_Jones_\\(Confederate_Army_officer\\) \"Sam Jones \\(Confederate\nArmy officer\\)\"). An impediment to this plan was the operation of Maj. Gen.\n[Ambrose Burnside](/wiki/Ambrose_Burnside \"Ambrose Burnside\")'s Union [Army of\nthe Ohio](/wiki/Army_of_the_Ohio \"Army of the Ohio\"), currently occupying\n[Knoxville](/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee \"Knoxville, Tennessee\") and blocking\nthe railroad. On October 17, Bragg had ordered the division of Maj. Gen.\n[Carter L. Stevenson](/wiki/Carter_L._Stevenson \"Carter L. Stevenson\") and two\ncavalry brigades to extend his right flank toward Knoxville. On October 22,\nBragg added the division of Brig. Gen. [John K. Jackson](/wiki/John_K._Jackson\n\"John K. Jackson\") to the expedition, bringing the total to about 11,000 men,\nand considered sending Stevenson's corps commander, John C. Breckinridge, as\nwell. In early November, Bragg ordered additional reinforcements and changed\nthe orders from simply extending the right flank to actually pushing Burnside\naway from Knoxville and reestablish communications with Virginia.[29]\n\nBut events in Virginia caused Bragg to change his plan. Responding to a\nsuggestion from President Davis, Bragg announced in a [council of\nwar](/wiki/Council_of_war \"Council of war\") on November 3 that he was sending\nLongstreet and his two divisions into [East Tennessee](/wiki/East_Tennessee\n\"East Tennessee\") to deal with Burnside, replacing the Stevenson/Jackson\nforce. Davis had suggested Longstreet for this assignment because he intended\nLongstreet's divisions to return to the [Army of Northern\nVirginia](/wiki/Army_of_Northern_Virginia \"Army of Northern Virginia\") at the\nend of the campaign and Knoxville was on the route back to Virginia. In the\nface of a rapidly expanding enemy force, Bragg chose to divide his army and\ndecrease his net defensive force by about 4,000 men (less than 10%) in order\nto facilitate the move on Knoxville. Campaign historian Steven E. Woodworth\njudged, however, that \"even the flat loss of the number of good soldiers in\nLongstreet's divisions would have been a gain to the army in ridding it of\ntheir general's feuding and blundering.\"[30]\n\n### Preparations for\nbattle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Preparations for battle\")]\n\nGrant had two weeks following Wauhatchie before Sherman was to arrive, and he\ncharged Thomas and Smith with the responsibility for planning an assault\nagainst Bragg, starting with an attack by Sherman on the Confederate right\nflank, emphasizing that he would not approve the plan until Sherman had an\nopportunity to review it. After considerable reconnaissance the two generals\npresented their plan on November 14. Sherman's arriving troops would use newly\nimproved roads to pass through the hills north of Chattanooga, taking a route\nthat was not visible from Lookout Mountain, hoping that Bragg would not know\nfor certain whether Sherman was targeting Chattanooga or Knoxville. Smith\nwould assemble every available boat and pontoon to allow Sherman's corps to\ncross the Tennessee River near the mouth of the South [Chickamauga\nCreek](/wiki/Chickamauga_Creek \"Chickamauga Creek\") and attack Bragg's right\nflank on Missionary Ridge. If the attack were successful, the Union would\ncontrol the two key railroad lines that supplied Bragg's army, forcing him to\nwithdraw. Thomas's army would simultaneously pin down the Confederate center\non Missionary Ridge. The plan also called for Hooker to assault and seize\nLookout Mountain, Bragg's left flank, and continue on to Rossville, where he\nwould be positioned to cut off a potential Confederate retreat to the\nsouth.[31]\n\nSherman arrived ahead of his troops on the evening of November 14. He observed\nthe end of Missionary Ridge that he was designated to attack and remarked that\nhe could seize it successfully by 9 a.m. on the assigned day. Grant approved\nThomas's and Smith's plan, although he withdrew support for the attack by\nHooker on Lookout Mountain, intending the mass of his attack to be by Sherman.\nSherman's men were still a considerable distance from Chattanooga because they\nhad been under orders from Halleck to repair the railroad as they marched the\n330 miles from Vicksburg (an order countermanded by Grant on October 27) and\ntheir commander had ignored advice from Thomas that he march rapidly without\nthe impediment of his trains, as Hooker had done. Although Grant had hoped to\nbegin offensive operations on November 21, by November 20 only one of\nSherman's brigades had crossed over Brown's Ferry and the attack had to be\npostponed. Grant was coming under pressure from Washington to react to\nLongstreet's advance against Burnside at Knoxville.[32]\n\nBragg, having dispatched most of his cavalry, had little means of gathering\nintelligence. He assumed that Sherman's corps would be heading toward his\ndepartment's extreme right flank at Knoxville, not Chattanooga. Therefore, he\nbelieved that the main Union assault would occur on his left flank, Lookout\nMountain. On November 12, Bragg placed Carter Stevenson in overall command for\nthe defense of the mountain, with Stevenson's division placed on the summit.\nThe brigades of Brig. Gens. [John K. Jackson](/wiki/John_K._Jackson \"John K.\nJackson\"), [Edward C. Walthall](/wiki/Edward_C._Walthall \"Edward C.\nWalthall\"), and [John C. Moore](/wiki/John_C._Moore_\\(general\\) \"John C. Moore\n\\(general\\)\") were placed on the \"bench\" of the mountain (a narrow and\nrelatively flat shelf that wrapped around the northern end of the mountain\napproximately halfway to the summit). Jackson later wrote about the\ndissatisfaction of the commanders assigned to this area, \"Indeed, it was\nagreed on all hands that the position was one extremely difficult to defense\nagainst a strong force of the enemy advancing under cover of a heavy\nfire.\"[33] Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, wrote that\ndespite the imposing appearance of Lookout Mountain, \"the mountain's strength\nwas a myth. ... It was impossible to hold [the bench, which] was commanded by\nFederal artillery at Moccasin Bend.\" Although Stevenson placed an artillery\nbattery on the crest of the mountain, the guns could not be depressed enough\nto reach the bench, which was accessible from numerous trails on the west side\nof the mountain.[34]\n\nDissatisfaction also prevailed in the Chattanooga Valley and on Missionary\nRidge, where Breckinridge, commanding Bragg's center and right, had only\n16,000 men to defend a line 5 miles long. Brig. Gen. [Patton\nAnderson](/wiki/Patton_Anderson \"Patton Anderson\"), whose division was\nassigned to the Confederate works along the western base of the ridge, wrote\n\"This line of defense, following its sinuosities, was over two miles in\nlength—nearly twice as long as a number of bayonets in the division could\nadequately defend.\"[35] Bragg exacerbated the situation on November 22 by\nordering Maj. Gen. [Patrick R. Cleburne](/wiki/Patrick_R._Cleburne \"Patrick R.\nCleburne\") to withdraw his and [Simon B.\nBuckner's](/wiki/Simon_Bolivar_Buckner,_Sr. \"Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.\")\ndivisions from the line and march to Chickamauga Station, for railroad\ntransport to Knoxville, removing 11,000 more men from the defense of\nChattanooga. This move was apparently made because, as Grant had hoped, Bragg\nconcluded that Sherman's troops were moving on to Knoxville, in which case\nLongstreet would need the reinforcements, for which he had been constantly\nclamoring since he was first given the assignment.[36]\n\n## Opposing\nforces[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Opposing forces\")]\n\n### Union[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Union\")]\n\nUnion subordinate commanders  \n---  \n  \n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Tecumseh_sherman.jpg/93px-Tecumseh_sherman.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tecumseh_sherman.jpg) Maj.

Grant became concerned that\nBragg was massively reinforcing Longstreet and sought to disrupt the movement.\nThomas ordered his division under Brig. Gen. [Thomas J.\nWood](/wiki/Thomas_J._Wood \"Thomas J.

Wood's\nmen assembled outside of their entrenchments and observed their objective\napproximately 2,000 yards to the east, a small knoll 100 feet high known as\nOrchard Knob (also known as Indian Hill). Maj. Gen. [Philip\nSheridan](/wiki/Philip_Sheridan \"Philip Sheridan\")'s division lined up\nsimilarly to protect Wood's right flank, and Howard's XI Corps extended the\nline to the left, presenting over 20,000 soldiers arrayed in almost parade-\nground alignment.[40]\n\nI never saw troops move into action in finer style than Thomas's did today.\nThey are entitled to the highest praise for their soldierly bearing and\nsplendid bravery.\n\nGrant's chief of staff, [John Rawlins](/wiki/John_Aaron_Rawlins \"John Aaron\nRawlins\")[41]\n\nAt 1:30 p.m., 14,000 Union soldiers moved forward at the [double\nquick](/wiki/Military_step \"Military step\"), sweeping across the plain,\nstunning the 600 Confederate defenders, who were able to fire only a single\nvolley before they were overrun. Casualties were relatively small on both\nsides. Grant and Thomas decided to order the men to hold their position and\nentrench, rather than following the original orders to withdraw. Orchard Knob\nbecame Grant's and Thomas's headquarters for the remainder of the battles.[42]\n\nBragg quickly readjusted his strategy, recalling all units that were within a\nday's march. Cleburne's division returned after dark from Chickamauga Station,\ninterrupting the process of boarding the trains to Knoxville. Bragg began to\nreduce the strength on his left by withdrawing Maj. Gen. [William H. T.\nWalker](/wiki/William_H._T._Walker \"William H. T. Walker\")'s division from the\nbase of Lookout Mountain and placing them on the far right of Missionary\nRidge, just south of Tunnel Hill. He assigned Hardee to command his now\ncritical right flank, turning over the left flank to Carter Stevenson. In the\ncenter, Breckinridge ordered his men to begin fortifying the crest of\nMissionary Ridge, a task that Bragg had somehow neglected for weeks. Unable to\ndecide whether to defend the base or the crest of the Ridge, the divisions of\nBrig. Gens. [William B. Bate](/wiki/William_B._Bate \"William B.

Hooker was ordered to \"take the\npoint only if his demonstration should develop its practicability.\"[46]\nFighting Joe ignored this subtlety and ordered Geary \"to cross Lookout Creek\nand to assault Lookout Mountain, marching down the valley and sweeping every\nrebel from it.\"[47]\n\nThe advance of Cruft and Osterhaus stalled at Lookout Creek, but Geary crossed\nthe stream unopposed further south and found that the\n[defile](/wiki/Defile_\\(geography\\) \"Defile \\(geography\\)\") between the\nmountain and the river had not been secured. The Union troops were opposed by\nBrig. Gen. [Edward C. Walthall](/wiki/Edward_C._Walthall \"Edward C.\nWalthall\")'s brigade of Maj. Gen.

Gen. [John C. Brown](/wiki/John_C._Brown \"John C. Brown\")'s\nConfederate brigade on the mountain top found themselves powerless to\nintervene in the battle raging below the cliffs. Geary's success allowed the\nother two divisions to cross the creek and push aside the Confederate\nskirmishers in front of them. Brig. Gen. [John C.\nMoore](/wiki/John_C._Moore_\\(general\\) \"John C. Moore \\(general\\)\") brought\nhis brigade up around 1:00 p.m. to become embroiled in a fight with Geary and\nBrig. Gen. [Walter C.

During the fight, Hooker sent a stream of \"alternate whimpering and\nblustering\" messages to Grant, but got it exactly right when he predicted, \"In\nall probability the enemy will evacuate tonight.\"[51] Realizing the battle was\nlost, Bragg ordered the position abandoned. At midnight the fog cleared and,\nunder a [lunar eclipse](/wiki/Lunar_eclipse \"Lunar eclipse\"), the divisions of\nStevenson and Cheatham retreated behind Chattanooga Creek, burning the bridges\nbehind them.[52]\n\nThat night Bragg asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat or to stand\nand fight.

Taking no further offensive action for the\nday, Sherman ordered his men to dig in on Billy Goat Hill.[55]\n\nOn November 25, Grant changed his plan and called for a [double\nenvelopment](/wiki/Double_envelopment \"Double envelopment\") by Sherman and\nHooker.

However, Thomas\nwanted support on his flank and called Hooker to cross the valley and\ndemonstrate against Bragg's left flank directly at the Rossville Gap.[57] As\nthe morning progressed, Sherman launched multiple direct assaults against\nCleburne's line on Tunnel Hill, but despite his significantly larger force,\ncommitted only three brigades to the attacks and made no headway. At the\nsouthern end of the battlefield, Hooker's advance was slowed for hours by the\nburned bridges on Chattanooga Creek.[58]\n\nSeeing the lack of progress on the flanks, around 3:30 p.m. Grant ordered\nThomas to move forward in the center in accordance with his earlier\ninstructions. The men of the Army of the Cumberland advanced and quickly\npushed the Confederates from their rifle pits but were then subjected to a\npunishing fire from the Confederate positions up the ridge. Most of Thomas's\ntroops had been at the disastrous loss at Chickamauga and had suffered taunts\nby Sherman's and Hooker's newly arrived forces. Now they were under fire from\nabove with no apparent plan to advance or move back. At this point, the Union\nsoldiers continued the attack against the remaining lines. This second advance\nwas taken up by the commanders on the spot, but also by some of the soldiers\nwho, on their own, sought shelter from the fire further up the slope.[59]\nBragg had placed his artillery and trenches of the infantry along the actual\ncrest of the ridge, rather than the [military crest](/wiki/Military_crest\n\"Military crest\"), and they were unable to provide effective fire. The Union\nadvance was disorganized but effective; finally overwhelming and scattering\nwhat ought to have been an impregnable Confederate line.[60] As such, the Army\nof the Cumberland's ascent of Missionary Ridge was one of the war's most\ndramatic events. Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones contend\nthat the Battle of Missionary Ridge was \"the war's most notable example of a\nfrontal assault succeeding against intrenched defenders holding high\nground.\"[61] A Union officer remembered that\n\n> Little regard to formation was observed. Each battalion assumed a triangular\n> shape, the colors at the apex. ... [a] color-bearer dashes ahead of the line\n> and falls. A comrade grasps the flag. ... He, too, falls. Then another[62]\n> picks it up ... waves it defiantly, and as if bearing a charmed life, he\n> advances steadily towards the top ...[63]\n\nGrant was initially furious that his orders to advance only as far as the\nrifle pits had not been followed exactly. Thomas was taken by surprise as\nwell, knowing that he would be blamed if the assault failed. But it succeeded.\nBy 4:30 p.m. the center of Bragg's line had broken completely and fled in\npanic, requiring the abandonment of Missionary Ridge and a headlong retreat\neastward to South [Chickamauga Creek](/wiki/Chickamauga_Creek \"Chickamauga\nCreek\"). The sole exception to the panicked flight was Cleburne's command, his\ndivision augmented by two brigades from another division, which formed the\nrearguard of Bragg's army as it retreated eastward.[64]\n\n### Rossville\nGap[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Rossville Gap\")]\n\nAfter Maj. Gen. [Joseph Hooker](/wiki/Joseph_Hooker \"Joseph Hooker\")'s command\nleft Lookout Mountain at about 10 a.m. and moved east, they encountered a\nsignificant obstacle. The bridge across Chattanooga Creek, about a mile from\nRossville Gap, had been burned by the Confederates as they withdrew the night\nbefore and the creek was running high. Brig. Gen. [Peter J.\nOsterhaus](/wiki/Peter_J._Osterhaus \"Peter J. Osterhaus\") assigned a 70-man\n[pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer_\\(military\\) \"Pioneer \\(military\\)\") unit to start\nrebuilding the bridge while men of the 27th Missouri created a rickety\nfootbridge and began crossing one by one. Hooker decided to leave his guns and\nwagons behind so that all of his infantry could cross first, but his advance\nwas delayed about three hours and he did not reach Rossville Gap until 3:30\np.m.[65]\n\nBreckinridge was absent while the Union attack wrecked his corps. Worried\nabout his left flank, he rode to the end of his line in the early afternoon.\nAt 3:30 p.m., about the time Thomas launched his four-division attack on\nMissionary Ridge, Breckinridge visited Stewart's left flank brigade of Col.\n[James T. Holtzclaw](/wiki/James_T._Holtzclaw \"James T. Holtzclaw\"), whose\ncommander pointed to the southwest where Hooker's men were busily bridging\nChattanooga Creek. Concerned about Rossville Gap, which lay undefended beyond\nhis left flank, Breckinridge ordered Holtzclaw to send a couple of regiments\nto hold the position. It was too late; by the time the Southerners reached the\ngap, Osterhaus's division had already marched through. Lt. J. Cabell\nBreckinridge, the general's son and aide-de-camp, rode into a group from the\n9th Iowa and was captured.[66]\n\nHooker quickly faced his troops to the north and organized a three-pronged\nattack. He sent Osterhaus along a trail east of Missionary Ridge, Cruft onto\nthe ridge itself, and Geary along the western face of the ridge. Holtzclaw\nfaced his men south and put up a fight, but Cruft and Osterhaus soon began\nherding the outnumbered Confederates north along Missionary Ridge. Hearing a\ntremendous racket to the north, Breckinridge finally rode off to find out what\nwas wrong. As Holtzclaw retreated before Hooker's command, he eventually\nbumped into Col. [Anson G. McCook](/wiki/Anson_G._McCook \"Anson G. McCook\")'s\n2nd Ohio of Carlin's brigade, now astride the ridge. Surrounded by superior\nforces on four sides, approximately 700 of Holtzclaw's men surrendered.[67]\n\n## Retreat and\npursuit[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Retreat and pursuit\")]\n\nDuring the night, Bragg ordered his army to withdraw toward Chickamauga\nStation on the [Western and Atlantic\nRailroad](/wiki/Western_and_Atlantic_Railroad \"Western and Atlantic Railroad\")\n(currently the site of Lovell Air Field) and on November 26 began retreating\ntoward [Dalton, Georgia](/wiki/Dalton,_Georgia \"Dalton, Georgia\"), in two\ncolumns taking two routes. Only Sheridan tried to pursue beyond Missionary\nRidge, but he finally gave up late that night when it was clear that he was\nnot being supported by either Granger or Thomas.[68]\n\n### Ringgold\nGap[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Ringgold Gap\")]\n\nThe pursuit ordered by Grant was effectively thwarted at the [Battle of\nRinggold Gap](/wiki/Battle_of_Ringgold_Gap \"Battle of Ringgold Gap\"). At 3\na.m. on November 27, Cleburne readied his men and waited until the Union force\nwas almost upon them before opening fire with artillery and rifles. Maj. Gen.\nJoseph Hooker's force was taken utterly by surprise, but he tried to use his\nnumbers to regain the initiative. He attempted to outflank the Confederates\nboth on the right and on the left, but the Confederates held their positions.\nFor five hours the slaughter continued, Cleburne's 4,100 soldiers against\nHooker's 12,000, with Hooker gaining little ground. Cleburne's men stayed to\nabout noon, then retreated, successfully allowing the wagons and artillery to\npass through the gap unharmed.[69]\n\nGrant called off the remaining pursuit because his army was low on rations and\nhe decided he needed to stay close to his supply line. Furthermore, Washington\nwas still clamoring for the rescue of Burnside in Knoxville and Grant was told\nthat the Union troops there had rations that would last only until December 3.\nPresident Lincoln's message of congratulations to Grant after Missionary Ridge\nhad said \"Well done. Many thanks to all. Remember Burnside.\"[70]\n\n##\nAftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/View_of_park_of_artillery_captured_at_the_Battle_of_Chattanooga%2C_November_24%2C_24%2C_25%2C_and_26th%2C_1863._%285613662257%29.jpg/220px-\nView_of_park_of_artillery_captured_at_the_Battle_of_Chattanooga%2C_November_24%2C_24%2C_25%2C_and_26th%2C_1863._%285613662257%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:View_of_park_of_artillery_captured_at_the_Battle_of_Chattanooga,_November_24,_24,_25,_and_26th,_1863._\\(5613662257\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:View_of_park_of_artillery_captured_at_the_Battle_of_Chattanooga,_November_24,_24,_25,_and_26th,_1863._\\(5613662257\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nCaptured artillery, c. 1865\n\nCasualties for the Union Army amounted to 5,824 (753 killed, 4,722 wounded,\nand 349 missing) of about 56,000 engaged; Bragg reported Confederate\ncasualties of 6,667 (361 killed, 2,160 wounded, and 4,146 missing, mostly\nprisoners) of about 44,000.[71] Southern losses may have been higher; Grant\nclaimed 6,142 prisoners. When a chaplain asked General Thomas whether the dead\nshould be sorted and buried by state, Thomas replied \"Mix 'em up. I'm tired of\n[States' rights](/wiki/States%27_rights \"States' rights\").\"[72]\n\nOne of the Confederacy's two major armies was routed. Bragg relieved\nBreckinridge from command, accusing him of drunkenness during the period\nNovember 23–27. Bragg chose to blame Breckinridge and the cowardice of his\narmy for the defeat. He resigned from command of the Army of Tennessee on\nDecember 1 and was replaced temporarily by Hardee. (Gen. [Joseph E.\nJohnston](/wiki/Joseph_E._Johnston \"Joseph E. Johnston\") assumed command of\nthe army on December 27.)[73]\n\nIn East Tennessee, Longstreet's offensive against Burnside (the [Knoxville\nCampaign](/wiki/Knoxville_Campaign \"Knoxville Campaign\")) fell apart at the\n[Battle of Fort Sanders](/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Sanders \"Battle of Fort\nSanders\") on November 29. Although he was ordered to rejoin Bragg, Longstreet\nconsidered the order impracticable and informed Bragg that he would return\nwith his command to Virginia but would maintain the siege on Knoxville as long\nas possible in the hopes that Burnside and Grant could be prevented from\njoining forces and annihilating the Army of Tennessee. This plan turned out to\nbe effective because Grant sent Sherman with 25,000 men to relieve the siege\nat Knoxville. Longstreet abandoned his siege on December 4, went into winter\nquarters, and returned to Virginia in the spring of 1864.[74]\n\nThe Confederate enthusiasm that had risen so high after Chickamauga had been\ndashed at Chattanooga.[75] The Union now held undisputed control of the state\nof Tennessee, including Chattanooga, the \"Gateway to the Lower South.\" The\ncity became the supply and logistics base for Sherman's 1864 [Atlanta\nCampaign](/wiki/Atlanta_Campaign \"Atlanta Campaign\"), as well as for the Army\nof the Cumberland,[76] and Grant had won his final battle in the\n[West](/wiki/Western_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Western Theater of the\nAmerican Civil War\") prior to receiving command of all Union armies in March\n1864.[77]\n\n## Battlefield\npreservation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Battlefield preservation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Chattanooga_Cemetery_with_Lookout_Mountain.jpg/220px-\nChattanooga_Cemetery_with_Lookout_Mountain.jpg)](/wiki/File:Chattanooga_Cemetery_with_Lookout_Mountain.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chattanooga_Cemetery_with_Lookout_Mountain.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNational cemetery at Chattanooga with a view of Lookout Mountain in the\ndistance\n\nPortions of the Chattanooga battlefields, including 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) at\nLookout Mountain, are preserved by the [National Park\nService](/wiki/National_Park_Service \"National Park Service\") as part of the\n[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military\nPark](/wiki/Chickamauga_and_Chattanooga_National_Military_Park \"Chickamauga\nand Chattanooga National Military Park\").\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/United_states_confederate_flag_hybrid.png/29px-United_states_confederate_flag_hybrid.png)[American Civil War portal](/wiki/Portal:American_Civil_War \"Portal:American Civil War\")\n\n  * [Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1863](/wiki/Troop_engagements_of_the_American_Civil_War,_1863 \"Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1863\")\n  * [List of costliest American Civil War land battles](/wiki/List_of_costliest_American_Civil_War_land_battles \"List of costliest American Civil War land battles\")\n  * [Battle of Chickamauga](/wiki/Battle_of_Chickamauga \"Battle of Chickamauga\")\n  * [First Battle of Chattanooga](/wiki/First_Battle_of_Chattanooga \"First Battle of Chattanooga\")\n  * [Second Battle of Chattanooga](/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Chattanooga \"Second Battle of Chattanooga\")\n  * [Armies in the American Civil War](/wiki/Armies_in_the_American_Civil_War \"Armies in the American Civil War\")\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chattanooga_Campaign&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"\"The Battle of Chattanooga\"\"](http://www.civilwarhome.com/chattanoogatimeline.htm).
