CBS had not had a regular\nlate-night talk show for most of its existence prior to that point, with only\none attempt (the short-lived _[Pat Sajak Show](/wiki/The_Pat_Sajak_Show \"The\nPat Sajak Show\")_ in 1990) between 1972 and Letterman's arrival. Letterman,\nwho joined CBS from [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\") after ending his eleven-year run as\nhost of _[Late Night](/wiki/Late_Night_with_David_Letterman \"Late Night with\nDavid Letterman\")_ and losing out on being [Johnny Carson](/wiki/Johnny_Carson\n\"Johnny Carson\")'s successor on _[The Tonight Show](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show\n\"The Tonight Show\")_ to [Jay Leno](/wiki/Jay_Leno \"Jay Leno\"), was initially\ncompetitive with his show's bitter rival, _[The Tonight Show with Jay\nLeno](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\")_\n; Letterman's _Late Show_ , however, slowly experienced a decline in ratings\nover the course of the 1990s and 2000s, dating back to an [affiliation\nagreement](/wiki/1994_United_States_broadcast_TV_realignment \"1994 United\nStates broadcast TV realignment\") between [New World\nCommunications](/wiki/New_World_Pictures#New_World_Communications \"New World\nPictures\") and [Fox](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting\nCompany\") that resulted in all nine CBS-affiliated stations it owned or\nrecently acquired switching to Fox between September and December 1994,\nrelegating the network to lower-rated former Fox affiliates and [independent\nstations](/wiki/Independent_station_\\(North_America\\) \"Independent station\n\\(North America\\)\") in many major cities.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Stephen_Colbert_November_2016.jpg/170px-\nStephen_Colbert_November_2016.jpg)](/wiki/File:Stephen_Colbert_November_2016.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Stephen_Colbert_November_2016.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Stephen Colbert](/wiki/Stephen_Colbert \"Stephen Colbert\") hosted his\nsatirical news show, _[The Colbert Report](/wiki/The_Colbert_Report \"The\nColbert Report\")_ , which won seven [Primetime Emmy\nAwards](/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award \"Primetime Emmy Award\") on [Comedy\nCentral](/wiki/Comedy_Central \"Comedy Central\"), from October 2005 to December\n2014\n\nAccording to [TV by the Numbers](/wiki/TV_by_the_Numbers \"TV by the Numbers\"),\nin February 2013, the live-plus-seven-day ratings for Letterman's _Late Show_\naveraged about 3.1 million per show for the 2012–13 season to date.[1] A year\nlater, average viewership was down to 2.8 million.[2] _Late Show_ also had the\noldest audience among the various late-night talk shows, which may have led to\nCBS' decision to pick a younger replacement for Letterman to compete with\n_[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy\nFallon](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Jimmy_Fallon \"The Tonight Show\nStarring Jimmy Fallon\")_ and [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company\n\"American Broadcasting Company\")'s _[Jimmy Kimmel\nLive!](/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live! \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\")_.[2] In addition,\nColbert's previous program did well among college students and young men\n18–34, which are prime target audiences for late-night comedy programming.[2]\n\nOn April 3, 2014, Letterman announced his retirement, with his final episode\nas host of _Late Show_ scheduled for May 20, 2015. On April 10, 2014, CBS\nannounced [Stephen Colbert](/wiki/Stephen_Colbert \"Stephen Colbert\") as\nLetterman's successor, signing him to a five-year agreement.[3] In contrast\nwith Colbert's previous program _[The Colbert Report](/wiki/The_Colbert_Report\n\"The Colbert Report\")_ , in which he played a [fictionalized version of\nhimself](/wiki/Stephen_Colbert_\\(character\\) \"Stephen Colbert \\(character\\)\"),\nColbert hosts the show (which retains the _Late Show_ branding, albeit with\nthe article \"The\" formally inserted into the title) as himself.[4] On April\n23, 2014, the character version of Stephen Colbert appeared on _[The Daily\nShow with Jon Stewart](/wiki/The_Daily_Show_with_Jon_Stewart \"The Daily Show\nwith Jon Stewart\")_ to announce that he had clearly \"won television\" and would\nbe closing down _The Colbert Report_ because he had met his goal. This came\nafter the announcement the character would not be used after the end of _The\nColbert Report_.[5] The final episode of _Report_ aired on December 18, 2014.\n\nSeveral states and municipalities attempted to coax CBS into moving production\nof the program from its long-time home in New York City with tax credits and\nother incentives, including Los Angeles, [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New\nOrleans\") and [Connecticut](/wiki/Connecticut \"Connecticut\").[6] On July 23,\n2014, CBS announced that _Late Show_ would continue to be produced at the [Ed\nSullivan Theater](/wiki/Ed_Sullivan_Theater \"Ed Sullivan Theater\") in New York\nwhen Colbert takes over.[7] [Jonathan Batiste](/wiki/Jonathan_Batiste\n\"Jonathan Batiste\") was announced as the

anticipation of the program's premiere, a new online presence was launched\nfor _The Late Show_ in June 2015, including new social media accounts, a\n[podcast](/wiki/Podcast \"Podcast\"), mobile app, and a monologue-styled video\nfocusing on the beard Colbert had grown since leaving _The Colbert\nReport_.[11] Throughout the remainder of the summer, videos would continue to\nbe released through the show's official [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\")\nchannel and mobile app. On July 1, 2015, Colbert hosted a special edition of a\n[public access](/wiki/Public_access_television \"Public access

\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Ed Sullivan Theater's marquee\n\nColbert has been given near-full control of the show, with little interference\nfrom CBS management in regard to format.[14][15] Colbert brought most of his\nstaff from _The Colbert Report_ with him to _The Late Show_ ,[14] as well as\noutsiders such as [Brian Stack](/wiki/Brian_Stack \"Brian Stack\"), who is best\nknown for his work on [Conan O'Brien](/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien \"Conan O'Brien\")'s\nprograms,[16] and [Jon Stewart](/wiki/Jon_Stewart \"Jon Stewart\"), former host\nof Colbert's previous sister program _[The Daily Show](/wiki/The_Daily_Show\n\"The Daily Show\")_ , who is credited as executive producer.[17] Colbert no\nlonger uses the [character](/wiki/Stephen_Colbert_\\(character\\) \"Stephen\nColbert \\(character\\)\") he had portrayed on _The Colbert Report_ , jokingly\nremarking to [Jeb Bush](/wiki/Jeb_Bush \"Jeb Bush\") that \"I used to play a\nnarcissistic conservative pundit – now I'm just a narcissist.\"[17]\n\nThe Ed Sullivan Theater underwent a full restoration to its original 1927\nsplendor in a process that began following Letterman's final episode,\nincluding the uncovering of the theater's ceiling, stained-glass windows and a\nrestoration of a chandelier, due to advances in technology that allow less\nsound and video equipment to cover up the auditorium's architectural details.\nThe 1993 restoration project for Letterman was only done on a few months'\nnotice after the theater was repurchased in February 1993 by CBS.[18]\n\nIn April 2016, former _[CBS This Morning](/wiki/CBS_This_Morning \"CBS This\nMorning\")_ executive producer [Chris Licht](/wiki/Chris_Licht \"Chris Licht\")\nwas named [showrunner](/wiki/Showrunner \"Showrunner\") for _The Late Show_ ;\nCBS had shown concerns that, despite improved ratings in comparison to\nLetterman's tenure, Colbert had a weak online presence in comparison to _[The\nTonight Show Starring Jimmy\nFallon](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Jimmy_Fallon \"The Tonight Show\nStarring Jimmy Fallon\")_ , and Colbert's lead-out _[The Late Late Show with\nJames Corden](/wiki/The_Late_Late_Show_with_James_Corden \"The Late Late Show\nwith James Corden\")_ (whose \"Carpool Karaoke\" segments have been popular as\n[viral videos](/wiki/Viral_video \"Viral

material.[19]\n\n##\nFormat[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Late_Show_with_Stephen_Colbert&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Format\")]\n\nSee also: [List of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\nsketches](/wiki/List_of_The_Late_Show_with_Stephen_Colbert_sketches \"List of\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert sketches\")\n\nColbert originally started the show with a [cold open](/wiki/Cold_open \"Cold\nopen\") and brief monologue before the opening sequence, which uses [tilt–shift\nphotography](/wiki/Tilt%E2%80%93shift_photography \"Tilt–shift photography\") of\nday and night [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") scenes that\nmake the city appear like a miniature model. During the opening sequence, a\n[voice-over](/wiki/Voice-over \"Voice-over\") announces the night's guests.[20]\nStarting with the April 18, 2016 broadcast, the first under new showrunner\nChris Licht, the format was modified to replace the cold open monologue with\nshort sketches starring Colbert, his staff, and often featuring that night's\nguests, followed by the opening sequence and Colbert entering the stage.[21]\nStarting with the coverage of the Republican National Convention in July 2016,\na new opening has debuted which starts off with writer Jen Spyra taking on the\nrole of announcer—becoming the first female announcer in broadcast, late-night\ntelevision—and announcing \"It's The Late Show With Stephen Colbert!\" to scenes\nof New York City at night including [Yankee Stadium](/wiki/Yankee_Stadium\n\"Yankee Stadium\"), [Times Square](/wiki/Times_Square \"Times Square\") and the\n[New York City Subway](/wiki/New_York_City_Subway \"New York City Subway\"),\nwith names of the night's guests imposed on various places. This structure is\nsimilar to the openings of other late-night shows such as _[The Tonight\nShow](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Jimmy_Fallon \"The Tonight Show Starring\nJimmy Fallon\")_ or _[Late Night](/wiki/Late_Night_with_Seth_Meyers \"Late Night\nwith Seth Meyers\")_. Similar to _The Colbert Report_ , graphics that resemble\nthe American Flag have also been added.\n\nThe open is followed by an extended [fake news](/wiki/News_satire \"News\nsatire\") style desk sequence with a run-through of recent headlines, in a\nmanner reminiscent of television newscasts and that of _[The Colbert\nReport](/wiki/The_Colbert_Report \"The Colbert Report\")_.[22] Also, the show\nfollows the same basic format as other late-night talk shows including the use\nof [sketch comedy](/wiki/Sketch_comedy \"Sketch comedy\"), guest interviews and\nmusical performances. Colbert's guest list includes more political and\ngovernment figures than his contemporaries; his first two weeks' guests\nincluded visits from [Jeb Bush](/wiki/Jeb_Bush \"Jeb Bush\"), [Joe\nBiden](/wiki/Joe_Biden \"Joe Biden\"), [Ban Ki-moon](/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon \"Ban Ki-\nmoon\"), [Stephen Breyer](/wiki/Stephen_Breyer \"Stephen Breyer\"), [Bernie\nSanders](/wiki/Bernie_Sanders \"Bernie Sanders\"), [Elizabeth\nWarren](/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren \"Elizabeth Warren\"), [Donald\nTrump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\"), and [Ted Cruz](/wiki/Ted_Cruz \"Ted\nCruz\").\n\nThus far, Colbert has not had any of his staff act as a\n[sidekick](/wiki/Sidekick \"Sidekick\") or [straight\nman](/wiki/Straight_man_\\(stock_character\\) \"Straight man \\(stock\ncharacter\\)\") on the show. While Colbert dances and physically interacts with\nJon Batiste while the band plays, they only occasionally engage in on-air\nbanter, unlike David Letterman's relationship with [Paul\nShaffer](/wiki/Paul_Shaffer \"Paul Shaffer\") or the relationship of other late\nnight hosts with their announcers or bandleaders. After the first few episodes\nin which Colbert introduced himself, he now uses an off-screen announcer.\nOccasionally, Colbert has brought out producers of his show, or enlisted the\nhelp of audience members, who assume a sidekick-like role for single segments,\nengaging in light dialogue about a topic.\n\n##\nEpisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Late_Show_with_Stephen_Colbert&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Episodes\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Secretary_Kerry_Makes_an_Appearance_on_The_Late_Show_With_Stephen_Colbert_in_New_York_City_%2821873224425%29.jpg/220px-\nSecretary_Kerry_Makes_an_Appearance_on_The_Late_Show_With_Stephen_Colbert_in_New_York_City_%2821873224425%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Secretary_Kerry_Makes_an_Appearance_on_The_Late_Show_With_Stephen_Colbert_in_New_York_City_\\(21873224425\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Secretary_Kerry_Makes_an_Appearance_on_The_Late_Show_With_Stephen_Colbert_in_New_York_City_\\(21873224425\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nColbert interviewing Secretary of State [John Kerry](/wiki/John_Kerry \"John\nKerry\")\n\nMain article: [List of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\nepisodes](/wiki/List_of_The_Late_Show_with_Stephen_Colbert_episodes \"List of\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert episodes\")\n\n### Notable\nepisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Late_Show_with_Stephen_Colbert&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Notable episodes\")]\n\nIn the show's series premiere, Colbert welcomed actor [George\nClooney](/wiki/George_Clooney \"George Clooney\") and politician [Jeb\nBush](/wiki/Jeb_Bush \"Jeb Bush\"), thanked former host David Letterman, and\njoined singer [Mavis Staples](/wiki/Mavis_Staples \"Mavis Staples\") and\nnumerous other musicians for a rendition of [Sly and the Family\nStone](/wiki/Sly_and_the_Family_Stone \"Sly and the Family Stone\")'s \"[Everyday\nPeople](/wiki/Everyday_People \"Everyday People\").\"[23] The episode nearly\nmissed its broadcast due to technical difficulties.[24] An early interview\nwith Vice President [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden \"Joe Biden\") received\nparticular acclaim.[25][26][27]\n\nFollowing the [terrorist attacks in Paris](/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks\n\"November 2015 Paris attacks\") that November, Colbert devoted his program to\nthat city.[28] A special football-themed episode aired as the [lead-out\nprogram](/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_lead-out_programs \"List of Super Bowl lead-\nout programs\") for [Super Bowl 50](/wiki/Super_Bowl_50 \"Super Bowl 50\") in\n2016, featuring guests President [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack\nObama\") (in a taped segment), [Tina Fey](/wiki/Tina_Fey \"Tina Fey\"), [Margot\nRobbie](/wiki/Margot_Robbie \"Margot Robbie\"), [Will\nFerrell](/wiki/Will_Ferrell \"Will Ferrell\"), and [Megyn\nKelly](/wiki/Megyn_Kelly \"Megyn Kelly\").[29]\n\nOn June 22, 2016, CBS announced that _The Late Show_ would broadcast two weeks\nof live episodes during the 2016\n[Republican](/wiki/2016_Republican_National_Convention \"2016 Republican\nNational Convention\") and\n[Democratic](/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Convention \"2016 Democratic\nNational Convention\") conventions. The first of these episodes, on July 18,\n2016, opened with a musical number by Colbert that compared the Republican\nconvention to being \"[Christmas in July](/wiki/Christmas_in_July \"Christmas in\nJuly\")\", and featured sketches where [Jon Stewart](/wiki/Jon_Stewart \"Jon\nStewart\") (revealed to have been living off-grid in a cabin) is told that\n[Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\") had clinched the Republican\nnomination for the [presidential\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016 \"United States\npresidential election, 2016\"), Colbert's\n[persona](/wiki/Stephen_Colbert_\\(character\\) \"Stephen Colbert \\(character\\)\")\nfrom _The Colbert Report_ is revived and delivers an edition of [The\nWord](/wiki/Recurring_segments_on_The_Colbert_Report#The_Word \"Recurring\nsegments on The Colbert Report\") on \"[Trumpiness](/wiki/Trumpiness\n\"Trumpiness\")\", and a filmed sketch touring the convention's\n[venue](/wiki/Quicken_Loans_Arena \"Quicken Loans Arena\") as his _[The Hunger\nGames](/wiki/The_Hunger_Games \"The Hunger Games\")_ -inspired character Julius\nFlickerman.[30][31][32] Stewart appeared once more the following Thursday,\ndelivering a segment criticizing the [Fox News Channel](/wiki/Fox_News_Channel\n\"Fox News Channel\") in the wake of the firing of its CEO [Roger\nAiles](/wiki/Roger_Ailes \"Roger Ailes\"). Colbert's performances during these\nepisodes were critically praised for their return to an emphasis on news-\noriented comedy similar to _The Colbert Report_ and _The Daily Show_.[33][34]\n\nOn May 1, 2017, in recognition of the completion of the first 100 days of\nPresident Donald Trump's administration, Stephen Colbert's monologue was\ndevoted to the president. After showing the interview from the previous day in\nwhich President Trump participated in an interview with CBS's [John\nDickerson](/wiki/John_Dickerson_\\(journalist\\) \"John Dickerson\n\\(journalist\\)\") on _Face the Nation_ and referred to the show as \"Deface the\nNation\" and abruptly ending the interview without answering one of Dickerson's\nquestions, Colbert began his monologue,[35] where “The only thing your mouth\nis good for is being Vladimir Putin’s cock holster,\" was one of a barrage of\npointed missives toward Trump in the 12-minute-long monologue. Colbert later\naddressed the controversy on-air, expressing surprise that he was not fired\nfor the remark, admitting he had used language that was too strong, but also\nstating that he was generally unrepentant over the rant and that \"I have\njokes; he has the launch codes.
