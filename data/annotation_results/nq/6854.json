Luffy made his debut in _One Piece_\nchapter #1 as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after\ninadvertently eating the supernatural Gum-Gum fruit.\n\nHe sails from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary\ntreasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as King of the Pirates. Luffy,\ncaptain of the [Straw Hat Pirates](/wiki/Straw_Hat_Pirates \"Straw Hat\nPirates\"), recruits crew members, fights antagonists, and aids and befriends\nthe inhabitants of several islands during his journey. Usually cheerful, he\nbecomes serious when he fights. Luffy uses his elasticity to concentrate his\npower, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, Gum-Gum Pistol,\nhe slingshots punches at opponents from a distance.\n\nLuffy appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials, and\n[OVAs](/wiki/Original_video_animation \"Original video animation\") of the\nmanga's anime adaptations and several of the franchise's [video\ngames](/wiki/Video_game \"Video game\"). Due to the series' international\npopularity, Luffy has become one of the world's most recognizable anime\ncharacters. In addition to the _One Piece_ franchise, the character has\nappeared in a number of manga and anime series and collaborative video games.\nHis critical reception has been largely positive.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Creation and conception\n    * 1.1 Development\n    * 1.2 Voice actors\n  * 2 Description\n    * 2.1 Personality\n    * 2.2 Abilities\n  * 3 Appearances\n    * 3.1 _One Piece_\n    * 3.2 In other media\n  * 4 Reception\n  * 5 Notes\n  * 6 References\n\n## Creation and\nconception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Creation and conception\")]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nWhen [Eiichiro Oda](/wiki/Eiichiro_Oda \"Eiichiro Oda\") created Luffy, he\nstrove for a \"manliness\" similar to that of [Akira\nToriyama](/wiki/Akira_Toriyama \"Akira Toriyama\")'s _[Dragon\nBall](/wiki/Dragon_Ball \"Dragon Ball\")_ series.[1] Oda said that he named his\nmain character \"Luffy\" because he felt that the name suited him. When he later\nlearned about the sailing term, \"[luffing](/wiki/Luffing \"Luffing\")\", he was\ndelighted by the coincidence.[2] In his prototype one-shots, \"Romance Dawn\",\nOda refined the artistic style and story elements before publishing the final\nproduct a year later as the first chapter of _One Piece_. In the second\nversion of \"Romance Dawn\", Luffy resembled his design at the beginning of the\nseries.[3] To please his readers, Oda added rubberization to Luffy for comic\neffect[2] and tries to make the character straightforward.[4]\n\n### Voice\nactors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Voice actors\")]\n\n[![Young, dark-haired voice actress Colleen\nClinkenbeard](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/ColleenClinkenbeardHeadshot.jpg/220px-\nColleenClinkenbeardHeadshot.jpg)](/wiki/File:ColleenClinkenbeardHeadshot.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ColleenClinkenbeardHeadshot.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nColleen Clinkenbeard voiced Luffy in English.\n\nIn the original Japanese version of the _One Piece_ anime series and later\nspin-offs of the franchise, Luffy was voiced by [Mayumi\nTanaka](/wiki/Mayumi_Tanaka \"Mayumi Tanaka\").[5] Tanaka said jokingly that she\nregrets providing Luffy's voice because she is a mother in real life and Luffy\nis much younger.[6] Asked about her voicing, Tanaka said that she \"strives for\nreality\" in scenes where Luffy speaks when he is eating or touching his\nnose.[7] In the OVA _Defeat the Pirate Ganzack!_ , Luffy was voiced by [Urara\nTakano](/wiki/Urara_Takano \"Urara Takano\").[8] The character was voiced by\n[Colleen Clinkenbeard](/wiki/Colleen_Clinkenbeard \"Colleen Clinkenbeard\") in\n[Funimation](/wiki/Funimation \"Funimation\")'s English-language dub of the _One\nPiece_ franchise.[9]\n\n## Description[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Description\")]\n\nLuffy is usually recognizable by his [straw hat](/wiki/Straw_hat \"Straw hat\"),\na gift from [\"Red-Haired\" Shanks](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Shanks\n\"List of One Piece characters\"). In his early childhood, he wears a white\nshirt and blue shorts. The character has a scar under his left eye from\nstabbing himself to demonstrate his courage to Shanks and his crew.[10] He\nlater wears a red vest, [denim](/wiki/Denim \"Denim\") shorts and sandals before\nreplacing his vest with a red, unbuttoned sea captain's coat[11] (revealing\nthe X-shaped scar on his chest he received from Akainu),[12] and a yellow sash\ntied around his waist.[11]\n\n###\nPersonality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Personality\")]\n\nLuffy is portrayed as a carefree, happy-go-lucky character with great ambition\nand a huge appetite, often thinking with his stomach and comically gorging\nhimself. Caring and generally good-hearted, he is not as dimwitted as many\nbelieve him to be and often demonstrates more understanding than the other\ncharacters expect. Knowing the danger ahead, Luffy is willing to risk his life\nto become King of the Pirates and protect his crew. A capable and reliable\ncaptain, he never puts his crew or himself at risk out of incompetence. During\nthe Loguetown story arc, Smoker (a navy captain at the time) says that Luffy\n\"enjoys playing stupid\"; Luffy responds with a mysterious smile.\n\nHe enlists Chopper and Brook for his crew for their personality or appearance,\nbut also because of his instinctive ability to read people. Luffy needs key\njobs filled by his crew (cook, navigator, doctor, musician and shipwright,\nfilled by Sanji, Nami, Chopper, Brook and Franky respectively). At the\nbeginning of the series, he said that he wanted at least 10 crew members with\nabilities he felt necessary for his goal. Despite his carefree personality,\neach crew member respects him in their own way.[13][14] Luffy is rarely\nconcerned about the consequences of his actions, doing what he feels is best\neven if it leads to retaliation by a powerful force.[15] He is an extremely\nloyal captain, who has demonstrated throughout the series that he is willing\nto risk his life for the well-being of his crew.[16]\n\n### Abilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Abilities\")]\n\nLuffy's rubberiness is a result of eating the Gum-Gum fruit,[n 3][17] which\nmakes him immune to most blunt forces and electric attacks and gives him the\nability to stretch his body at will. He uses his elasticity to accelerate part\nor all of his body to deliver punches, kicks, head butts and body checks or\nfor propulsion. Like others exposed to Devil Fruit, Luffy cannot swim; when he\nis submerged in water or contacts the Sea-Prism Stone, he loses his strength\nand cannot move on his own. In addition to his Devil Fruit powers, he has\nimmense strength and endurance.\n\nLuffy's signature attack is the Gum-Gum Pistol, a punch which he learned\nduring years of training. Another technique developed later in the series is\nSecond Gear (ギア2 (セカンド), _Gia Sekando_), increasing his strength and speed for\na short time but straining his body. Observing\n[CP9's](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#CP9 \"List of One Piece characters\")\nShave (剃, _Soru_) technique, Luffy adapted the move to his rubber body and\nmatched the assassins' speed. Third Gear (ギア3 (サード), _Gia Sādo_), another\ntechnique, uses air in his bones to attack but makes him shrink\nafterwards.[18] Luffy can use both techniques simultaneously; after two years,\nhe has gained better control of the techniques and is no longer affected by\ntheir drawbacks.\n\nEventually, Luffy develops his latent ability to use Haki (覇気, ambition). This\nability has two main types: Armament Haki (武装色の覇気, _Busōshoku no Haki_), an\narmor-like force which can amplify defense and the force of attacks and negate\na Devil Fruit user's defense, allow physical contact and damage, and\nObservation Haki (見聞色の覇気, _Kenbunshoku no Haki_), a sixth sense which can read\na person's moves and detect their presence. He also has a rare third type, the\nConquering King's Haki (覇王色の覇気, _Haōshoku no Haki_), which can render people\nor animals near him unconscious.[19] Two years later, Luffy masters the three\ntypes of Haki and uses them with his improved attacks. As a result of his\nencounter with [Magellan](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Impel_Down \"List\nof One Piece characters\"), he has also developed an immunity to poison\n(although it is implied that a strong poison may affect him).\n\nLuffy develops another technique, Fourth Gear (ギア4 (フォース), _Gia Fōsu_)\n(similar to Third Gear), inflating his muscles to increase the size of his\nlimbs (except for his legs). He can make destructive moves by compressing and\nreleasing his limbs, and can fly in a similar fashion to CP9's Moon Walk (月歩,\n_Geppō_) technique.[20]\n\n## Appearances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Appearances\")]\n\n### _One\nPiece_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: One Piece\")]\n\nLuffy first appears as a young boy in Windmill Village, who befriends the\npirate [\"Red-Haired\"](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Shanks \"List of One\nPiece characters\") Shanks and intends to become one himself. Before the series\nbegins, he accidentally eats the Gum-Gum fruit and acquires rubber powers.\nLuffy is later saved by Shanks from being devoured by a Sea King, a large sea\nbeast, and Shanks loses an arm. Ten years later, Luffy leaves the village in\nsearch of the One Piece treasure and to become King of the Pirates. He meets\nswordsman [Roronoa Zoro](/wiki/Roronoa_Zoro \"Roronoa Zoro\"), ocean\n[navigator](/wiki/Navigator \"Navigator\") and thief\n[Nami](/wiki/Nami_\\(One_Piece\\) \"Nami \\(One Piece\\)\"), cowardly marksman and\nliar [Usopp](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Usopp \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\"), and chivalrous chef\n[Sanji](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Sanji \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\"), and invites them to join his crew. Luffy also encounters and\ndefeats the East Blue pirate [Buggy the\nClown](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Buggy \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\") and the fishman\n[Arlong](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Arlong \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\"), becoming known to the general populace and the pirate-hating\nMarines. He later accepts an offer to return Princess Nefertari Vivi of\nAlabasta to her homeland to stop a rebellion incited by [Seven Warlords of the\nSea](/wiki/Seven_Warlords_of_the_Sea \"Seven Warlords of the Sea\") member and\nBaroque Works crime-syndicate leader [Sir\nCrocodile](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Crocodile \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\"). After he defeats Crocodile, Luffy accepts Crocodile subordinate\n[Nico Robin](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Nico_Robin \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\") as his ally. On Drum Island he finds reindeer doctor [Tony Tony\nChopper](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Tony_Tony_Chopper \"List of One\nPiece characters\"), who also joins his crew.\n\nWhile visiting Skypiea, the crew is drawn into a war. Luffy defeats the god\n[Eneru](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Eneru \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\"), ending the war. He meets Admiral\n[Aokiji](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Aokiji \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\"), who easily defeats him. Luffy learns about Robin's background\nand faces enemies connected to her, such as\n[Franky](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Franky \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\") (a cyborg who becomes Luffy's ally) and the intelligence agency\n[Cipher Pol No. 9](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Cipher_Pol_No._9 \"List\nof One Piece characters\"). Luffy and his crew save Robin at Enies Lobby. After\ntheir fight with CP9, Franky joins the crew. Luffy enters the Florian Triangle\nand encounters [Brook](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Brook \"List of One\nPiece characters\"), a skeletal musician. To return Brook's shadow, he defeats\nwarlord [Gecko Moria](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Gecko_Moria \"List of\nOne Piece characters\"). After releasing the rest of the island's prisoners,\nBrook becomes a member of Luffy's crew. They go to the Sabaody Archipelago,\nand have [Silvers\nRayleigh](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Silvers_Rayleigh \"List of One\nPiece characters\") coat the _Thousand Sunny_ to enter the second half of the\nGrand Line. After Luffy's encounter with Admiral\n[Kizaru](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Kizaru \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\") and warlord [Bartholomew\nKuma](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Bartholomew_Kuma \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\"), he and his crew are sent to separate parts of the world.\n\nStranded on Amazon Lily, an island ruled by the warlord Boa Hancock, Luffy\nimpresses Hancock with his bravery and selflessness. Hancock falls in love\nwith Luffy and brings him to the underground Impel Down prison to save his\nbrother, Portgas D. Ace, from execution. Luffy breaks into the prison and\nmeets previous foes and new allies, such as former warlord\n[Jimbei](/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_characters#Jimbei \"List of One Piece\ncharacters\"). He frees the prisoners, they arrive at Marineford and Luffy is\ndrawn into a war between the navy and Whitebeard's pirate crews. Ace gives his\nlife to save Luffy, who is evacuated with Jimbei from Marineford by Trafalgar\nLaw. Returning to Amazon Lily, Luffy remembers first meeting Ace; after Shanks\nleft Windmill Village, Luffy's grandfather left him in the care of bandit\nCurly Dadan. He befriends Ace and Sabo, who are like brothers to him, but Sabo\nis apparently killed by a World Noble. After returning to Marineford to send a\nhidden message to his crew, Luffy trains with Rayleigh on Ruskaina Island to\nbecome stronger.\n\nTwo years later Luffy rejoins the Straw Hats, but the crew is briefly\nseparated again while sailing to Fishman Island. Luffy and the others meet\nJimbei and the island's princess, Shirahoshi, and are drawn into a battle for\nthe island against fishman Hody Jones. He, the crew and Jimbei conceive of a\nplan to defeat Hody and his henchmen. After Hody's defeat, Luffy retrieves the\nstolen treasure from the rookie pirate Caribou and begins a feud with Big Mom.\nThe crew enters the New World; Luffy, Zoro, Usopp and Robin disembark on Punk\nHazard and are soon captured by Caesar Clown, a jealous rival of the scientist\nVegapunk. Luffy and his crew ally with Trafalgar Law, and he defeats Caesar\nafter learning about his history. With Caesar hostage the alliance lands on\nDressrosa (the kingdom of Don Quixote Doflamingo), where Luffy enters a\ntournament to win Ace's Devil Fruit.\n\n### In other\nmedia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: In other media\")]\n\nLuffy has appeared in every _One Piece_ licensed electronic video game to\ndate, including _[Jump Super Stars](/wiki/Jump_Super_Stars \"Jump Super\nStars\")_ and _[Jump Ultimate Stars](/wiki/Jump_Ultimate_Stars \"Jump Ultimate\nStars\")_ , and is featured in the 2006 _[Dragon Ball Z](/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z\n\"Dragon Ball Z\")_ -_One Piece_ -_[Naruto](/wiki/Naruto \"Naruto\")_ crossover\ngame _[Battle Stadium D.O.N](/wiki/Battle_Stadium_D.O.N \"Battle Stadium\nD.O.N\")_.

His clothes were designed by Shinichi \"Miter\" Mita.[30]\n\n## Reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nLuffy led all three _Shōnen Jump_ character popularity polls.[31][32][33]\nAccording to [Funimation Entertainment](/wiki/Funimation_Entertainment\n\"Funimation Entertainment\")'s [Mike McFarland](/wiki/Mike_McFarland \"Mike\nMcFarland\") and [Christopher Sabat](/wiki/Christopher_Sabat \"Christopher\nSabat\"), Luffy was more likable than _Dragon Ball_ 's [Son\nGoku](/wiki/Son_Goku_\\(Dragon_Ball\\) \"Son Goku \\(Dragon Ball\\)\").[34] Joe\nMcCulloch preferred Luffy to [Naruto Uzumaki](/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki \"Naruto\nUzumaki\") from _[Naruto](/wiki/Naruto \"Naruto\")_ because Luffy \"work[ed] his\nass off\" to achieve his goals after accidentally acquiring his powers.[35]\nLuffy was nominated in the Best Male Character category for the 2008 Society\nfor the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards, losing to [Ichigo\nKurosaki](/wiki/Ichigo_Kurosaki \"Ichigo Kurosaki\") of\n_[Bleach](/wiki/Bleach_\\(manga\\) \"Bleach \\(manga\\)\")_.[36][37] He was ranked\n22nd on Chris Mackenzie's IGN list of top-25 anime characters of all time.[38]\n[NTT](/wiki/NTT \"NTT\") customers chose Luffy as their second-favorite black-\nhaired male anime character.[39] The Gum-Gum Gatling technique topped the male\ncategory in a Japanese survey of the most popular moves in manga and\nanime.[40] In a Japanese TV special from August 2017, Luffy was voted as the\n8th \"strongest hero\" from the [Showa Era](/wiki/Showa_Era \"Showa Era\") as well\nas the 4th one from the [Heisei Era](/wiki/Heisei_Era \"Heisei Era\").[41]\n\nLuffy has been praised in a number of publications. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews\ncalled Luffy \"likabl[y] goofy\" and an idealist with infectious optimism.[42]\nIn a review of _[One Piece The Movie: Dead End no\nBōken](/wiki/One_Piece_The_Movie:_Dead_End_no_B%C5%8Dken \"One Piece The Movie:\nDead End no Bōken\")_ , the fourth _One Piece_ film, _[The Star\nOnline](/wiki/The_Star_\\(Malaysia\\) \"The Star \\(Malaysia\\)\")_ described him as\n\"an airhead and brilliant fighter\".[43] Rika Takahashi of [EX](/wiki/TV_Asahi\n\"TV Asahi\") wrote that Luffy's stretching powers set _One Piece_ apart from\n\"the old stereotypical adventure manga\" and the many other \"combat-oriented\nmangas [_[sic](/wiki/Sic \"Sic\")_]\", making the series \"something new and\ninteresting\".[44] [Anime News Network](/wiki/Anime_News_Network \"Anime News\nNetwork\") (ANN) writer Zac Bertschy found Luffy reminiscent of _[Rurouni\nKenshin](/wiki/Rurouni_Kenshin \"Rurouni Kenshin\")_ 's character [Himura\nKenshin](/wiki/Himura_Kenshin \"Himura Kenshin\") in personality and attitude,\nbut still thought him entertaining.[45] Mania Entertainment's Bryce Coulter\ncalled Luffy a \"great shonen hero\".[46] ANN's Carl Kimlinger wrote, \"[Colleen\nClinkenbeard](/wiki/Colleen_Clinkenbeard \"Colleen Clinkenbeard\")'s Luffy\ncontinues to grow on you\".[47] In the final chapter of _Naruto_ , [Boruto\nUzumaki](/wiki/Boruto_Uzumaki \"Boruto Uzumaki\") makes a drawing of Luffy as a\nlegacy of him and the series.[48]\n\nIn a _Weekly Shonen Jump_ manga, Tsugihagi Hyouryuu Sakka (a character\nresembling Luffy) says, \"Instead of saying what you hate, say what you like!\"\nIn the _One Piece_ manga, Luffy cited but changed it to \"Instead of saying\nwhat you like, say what you hate!\" The meme was acknowledged in the crossover\n[fighting game](/wiki/Fighting_game \"Fighting game\"), _[J-Stars Victory\nVS](/wiki/J-Stars_Victory_VS \"J-Stars Victory VS\")_[49]\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Monkey_D._Luffy&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** 麦わらのルフィ, _Mugiwara no Rufi_\n  2. **Jump up ^** Pronounced with a long u, rather than a short one: [/ˈluːfiː/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\") [_**LOO** -fee_](/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key \"Help:Pronunciation respelling key\").
