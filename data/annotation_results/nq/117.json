It\ngenerally flows to the east and southeast as it traverses the U.S. states of\n[Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\"), [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\"),\n[Oklahoma](/wiki/Oklahoma \"Oklahoma\"), and [Arkansas](/wiki/Arkansas\n\"Arkansas\"). The river's source basin lies in the [western United\nStates](/wiki/Western_United_States \"Western United States\") in Colorado,\nspecifically the [Arkansas River Valley](/wiki/Arkansas_River_Valley \"Arkansas\nRiver Valley\"), where the headwaters derive from the [snowpack](/wiki/Snowpack\n\"Snowpack\") in the [Sawatch](/wiki/Sawatch_Range \"Sawatch Range\") and\n[Mosquito](/wiki/Mosquito_Range \"Mosquito Range\") mountain ranges. It then\nflows east into the [Midwest](/wiki/Midwestern_United_States \"Midwestern\nUnited States\") via Kansas, and finally into the\n[South](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\") through\nOklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nAt 1,469 miles (2,364 km), it is the sixth-longest river in the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"),[5] the second-longest tributary\nin the Mississippi–[Missouri](/wiki/Missouri_River \"Missouri River\") system,\nand the [45th longest river in the world](/wiki/List_of_rivers_by_length \"List\nof rivers by length\"). Its origin is in the [Rocky\nMountains](/wiki/Rocky_Mountains \"Rocky Mountains\") in [Lake County,\nColorado](/wiki/Lake_County,_Colorado \"Lake County, Colorado\"), near\n[Leadville](/wiki/Leadville,_Colorado \"Leadville, Colorado\"). In 1859,\n[placer](/wiki/Placer_mining \"Placer mining\") gold discovered in the Leadville\narea brought thousands seeking to strike it rich, but the easily recovered\nplacer gold was quickly exhausted.[6] The Arkansas River's mouth is at\n[Napoleon, Arkansas](/wiki/Napoleon,_Arkansas \"Napoleon, Arkansas\"), and its\ndrainage basin covers nearly 170,000 sq mi (440,300 km²).[3] In terms of\nvolume, the river is much smaller than the Missouri and\n[Ohio](/wiki/Ohio_River \"Ohio River\") Rivers, with a mean discharge of roughly\n41,000 cubic feet per second (1,200 m3/s).\n\nThe Arkansas from its headwaters to the [100th meridian\nwest](/wiki/100th_meridian_west \"100th meridian west\") formed part of the\n[U.S.-Mexico border](/wiki/U.S.-Mexico_border \"U.S.-Mexico border\") from the\n[Adams–Onís Treaty](/wiki/Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty \"Adams–Onís Treaty\")\n(in force 1821) until the [Texas Annexation](/wiki/Texas_Annexation \"Texas\nAnnexation\") or [Treaty of Guadalupe\nHidalgo](/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo \"Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Pronunciations\n  * 2 Hydrography\n  * 3 Allocation problems\n  * 4 Riverway commerce\n  * 5 The river in history\n    * 5.1 American Civil War\n    * 5.2 Post Civil War\n  * 6 Angling\n  * 7 Image gallery\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 References\n  * 11 External links\n\n##\nPronunciations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Arkansas_River&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Pronunciations\")]\n\nName pronunciation varies by region.

At its headwaters, the Arkansas runs as a steep fast-flowing\nmountain river through the Rockies in its narrow valley, dropping 4,600 feet\n(1.4 km) in 120 miles (193 km). This section supports extensive [whitewater\nrafting](/wiki/Whitewater_rafting \"Whitewater rafting\"), including The Numbers\n(near [Granite, Colorado](/wiki/Granite,_Colorado \"Granite, Colorado\")),\n[Brown's Canyon](/wiki/Browns_Canyon_National_Monument \"Browns Canyon National\nMonument\"), and the [Royal Gorge](/wiki/Royal_Gorge \"Royal Gorge\").\n\nAt [Cañon City, Colorado](/wiki/Ca%C3%B1on_City,_Colorado \"Cañon City,\nColorado\"), the Arkansas River valley widens and flattens markedly. Just west\nof [Pueblo, Colorado](/wiki/Pueblo,_Colorado \"Pueblo, Colorado\"), the river\nenters the [Great Plains](/wiki/Great_Plains \"Great Plains\"). Through the rest\nof [Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\"), [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\"), and\nmuch of [Oklahoma](/wiki/Oklahoma \"Oklahoma\"), it is a typical Great Plains\nriverway, with wide, shallow banks subject to seasonal flooding and periods of\ndwindling flow. Tributaries include the [Cimarron\nRiver](/wiki/Cimarron_River_\\(Arkansas_River\\) \"Cimarron River \\(Arkansas\nRiver\\)\") and the [Salt Fork Arkansas River](/wiki/Salt_Fork_Arkansas_River\n\"Salt Fork Arkansas River\").\n\nIn eastern Oklahoma the river begins to widen further into a more contained\nconsistent channel. To maintain more reliable flow rates, a series of large\nreservoir lakes have been built on the Arkansas and its intersecting\ntributaries including the [Canadian](/wiki/Canadian_River \"Canadian River\"),\n[Verdigris](/wiki/Verdigris_River \"Verdigris River\"), [Neosho\n(Grand)](/wiki/Grand_River_\\(Oklahoma\\) \"Grand River \\(Oklahoma\\)\"),\n[Illinois](/wiki/Illinois_River_\\(Arkansas\\) \"Illinois River \\(Arkansas\\)\"),\nand [Poteau](/wiki/Poteau_River \"Poteau River\") rivers.[9] These locks and\ndams allow the river to be navigable by barges and large river craft downriver\nof [Muskogee, Oklahoma](/wiki/Muskogee,_Oklahoma \"Muskogee, Oklahoma\"), where\nthe [McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System](/wiki/McClellan-\nKerr_Arkansas_River_Navigation_System \"McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River\nNavigation System\") joins in with the Verdigris River.\n\nInto western [Arkansas](/wiki/Arkansas \"Arkansas\"), the river path works\nbetween the encroaching [Boston](/wiki/Boston_Mountains \"Boston Mountains\")\nand [Ouachita](/wiki/Ouachita_Mountains \"Ouachita Mountains\") Mountains,\nincluding many isolated, flat-topped mesas, buttes, or\n[monadnocks](/wiki/Monadnock \"Monadnock\") such as [Mount\nNebo](/wiki/Mount_Nebo_\\(Arkansas\\) \"Mount Nebo \\(Arkansas\\)\"), [Petit Jean\nMountain](/wiki/Petit_Jean_State_Park \"Petit Jean State Park\"), and [Mount\nMagazine](/wiki/Mount_Magazine \"Mount Magazine\"), the highest point in the\nstate. The river valley then expands as it encounters much flatter land\nbeginning just west of [Little Rock, Arkansas](/wiki/Little_Rock,_Arkansas\n\"Little Rock, Arkansas\"). It continues eastward across the plains and forests\nof eastern Arkansas until it flows into the [Mississippi\nRiver](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\").\n\nWater flow in the Arkansas River (as measured in central [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas\n\"Kansas\")) has dropped from approximately 248 cubic feet per second (7 m³/s)\naverage from 1944-1963 to 53 cubic feet per second (1.5 m³/s) average from\n1984–2003, largely because of the pumping of [groundwater](/wiki/Groundwater\n\"Groundwater\") for [irrigation](/wiki/Irrigation \"Irrigation\") in eastern\n[Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\") and western [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas\n\"Kansas\").\n\nImportant cities along the Arkansas River include [Pueblo,\nColorado](/wiki/Pueblo,_Colorado \"Pueblo, Colorado\"), [Garden City,\nKansas](/wiki/Garden_City,_Kansas \"Garden City, Kansas\"), [Dodge City,\nKansas](/wiki/Dodge_City,_Kansas \"Dodge City, Kansas\"), [Wichita,\nKansas](/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas \"Wichita, Kansas\"), [Tulsa,\nOklahoma](/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma \"Tulsa, Oklahoma\"), [Fort Smith,\nArkansas](/wiki/Fort_Smith,_Arkansas \"Fort Smith, Arkansas\"), and [Little\nRock, Arkansas](/wiki/Little_Rock,_Arkansas \"Little Rock, Arkansas\").\n\nThe [I-40 bridge disaster](/wiki/I-40_bridge_disaster \"I-40 bridge disaster\")\nof May 2002 took place on [I-40](/wiki/Interstate_40 \"Interstate 40\")'s\ncrossing of [Kerr Reservoir](/wiki/Robert_S._Kerr_Reservoir \"Robert S.

The problems over\nthe possession and use of Arkansas River water by Colorado and Kansas led to\nthe creation of an [interstate compact](/wiki/Interstate_compact \"Interstate\ncompact\") or agreement between the two states.[10] While Congress approved the\nArkansas River Compact in 1949,[10] the compact did not stop further disputes\nby the two states over water rights to the river.\n\nThe Kansas-Oklahoma Arkansas River Basin Compact was created in 1965 to\npromote mutual consideration and equity over water use in the basin shared by\nthose states. It led to the Kansas-Oklahoma Arkansas River Commission, which\nwas charged with administering the compact and reducing pollution. The compact\nwas approved and implemented by both states in 1970, and has been in force\nsince then.[9]\n\n## Riverway\ncommerce[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Arkansas_River&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Riverway commerce\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Kerr-\nMcClellan_map.png/170px-Kerr-McClellan_map.png)](/wiki/File:Kerr-\nMcClellan_map.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kerr-McClellan_map.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nInland waterway system with McClellan-Kerr Navigational Channel shown in red\n\nThe [McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System](/wiki/McClellan-\nKerr_Arkansas_River_Navigation_System \"McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River\nNavigation System\") begins at the [Tulsa Port of\nCatoosa](/wiki/Tulsa_Port_of_Catoosa \"Tulsa Port of Catoosa\") on the\n[Verdigris River](/wiki/Verdigris_River \"Verdigris River\"), enters the\nArkansas River near Muskogee, and runs via an extensive lock and dam system to\nthe Mississippi River. Through Oklahoma and Arkansas, dams which artificially\ndeepen and widen the river to sustain commercial barge traffic and\nrecreational use give the river the appearance of a series of\nreservoirs.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System diverts from the Arkansas\nRiver 2.5 mi (4.0 km) upstream of the [Wilbur D. Mills\nDam](/wiki/Wilbur_D._Mills_Dam \"Wilbur D. Mills Dam\") to avoid the long\nwinding route which the lower Arkansas River follows. This circuitous portion\nof the Arkansas River between the Wilbur D. Mills Dam and the Mississippi\nRiver was historically bypassed by river vessels; early steamboats instead\nfollowing a network of rivers—known as the Arkansas Post Canal—which flowed\nnorth of the lower Arkansas River and followed a shorter and more direct route\nto the Mississippi River. When the McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation\nSystem was constructed between 1963 and 1970, the Arkansas Post Canal was\nsignificantly improved, while the lower Arkansas River continued to be\nbypassed by commercial vessels.[11]\n\n## The river in\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Arkansas_River&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: The river in history\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Devil%27s_Punch_Bowl_falls%2C_from_Robert_N._Dennis_collection_of_stereoscopic_views.jpg/220px-\nDevil%27s_Punch_Bowl_falls%2C_from_Robert_N._Dennis_collection_of_stereoscopic_views.jpg)](/wiki/File:Devil%27s_Punch_Bowl_falls,_from_Robert_N._Dennis_collection_of_stereoscopic_views.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Devil%27s_Punch_Bowl_falls,_from_Robert_N._Dennis_collection_of_stereoscopic_views.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nDevil's Punch Bowl falls, Grand Canyon of the Arkansas River in Colorado, from\nRobert N.

Also in the\n1540s, [Hernando de Soto](/wiki/Hernando_de_Soto_\\(explorer\\) \"Hernando de\nSoto \\(explorer\\)\") discovered the junction of the Arkansas with the\nMississippi. The Spanish originally called the river _Napeste_.[9] \"The name\n\"Arkansas\" was first applied by Father [Jacques\nMarquette](/wiki/Jacques_Marquette \"Jacques Marquette\"), who called the river\n_Akansa_ in his journal of 1673. The Joliet-Marquette expedition travelled the\n[Mississippi River](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\") from [Prairie\ndu Chien, Wisconsin](/wiki/Prairie_du_Chien,_Wisconsin \"Prairie du Chien,\nWisconsin\") towards the Gulf of Mexico, but turned back at the mouth of the\nArkansas River. By that time, they had encountered Native Americans carrying\nEuropean trinkets, and feared confrontation with Spanish conquistadors.\n\n[Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe](/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_B%C3%A9nard_de_la_Harpe\n\"Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe\"), a French trader, explorer and nobleman\nhad led an expedition into what is now Oklahoma in 1718-19. His original\nobjective was to establish a trading post near the present city of [Texarkana,\nArkansas](/wiki/Texarkana,_Arkansas \"Texarkana, Arkansas\"), but he then\nextended his trip overland as far north as the Arkansas River (which he\ndesignated as the _Alcansas_). The explorer wrote he and 9 other men,\nincluding three Caddo guides and 22 horses loaded with trade goods had come to\na native settlement overlooking the river, where there were about 6,000\nnatives, who gave the strangers a warm welcome. La Harpe's party were honored\nwith the [calumet](/wiki/Ceremonial_pipe \"Ceremonial pipe\") ceremony and spent\nten days at this location. In 1988, evidence of a native village was\ndiscovered along the Arkansas River 13 miles (21 km) south of present-day\nTulsa, Oklahoma. By then, the site was known as the [Lasley Vore\nSite](/wiki/Lasley_Vore_Site \"Lasley Vore Site\").[12] [a]\n\nFrench traders and trappers who had opened up trade with Indian tribes in\nCanada and the areas around the Great Lakes began exploring the Mississippi\nand some of its northern tributaries. They soon learned that the birch-bark\ncanoes, which had served them so well on the northern waterways, were too\nlight for use on the southern rivers, such as the Arkansas. They turned to\nmaking and using dugout canoes, which they called _pirogues_ , made by\nhollowing out the trunks of [cottonwood](/wiki/Populus_deltoides \"Populus\ndeltoides\") trees. [b] Cottonwoods are plentiful along the streams of the\nsouthwest and grow to large sizes. The wood is soft and easily worked with the\ncrude tools carried by both the French and Indians. The pirogues The pirogues\nwere sturdier and could be more for navigating the sandbars and snags of the\nSouthern waterways.[13]\n\nIn 1819, the [Adams-Onís Treaty](/wiki/Adams-On%C3%ADs_Treaty \"Adams-Onís\nTreaty\") set the Arkansas as part of the frontier between the United States\nand Spanish [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\"). This continued until the United\nStates annexed [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\") after the [Mexican-American\nWar](/wiki/Mexican-American_War \"Mexican-American War\"), in 1846. The treaty\nwas made shortly after \"Old Settler\" [Cherokees](/wiki/Cherokee_nation\n\"Cherokee nation\") moved to near what became known as [Webbers\nFalls](/wiki/Webbers_Falls,_Oklahoma \"Webbers Falls, Oklahoma\") on the\nArkansas River.

These included\nflatboats (_bateaus_) and [keelboats](/wiki/Keelboats \"Keelboats\"). Along with\nthe pirogues, they transported piles of deer, bear, otter, beaver and buffalo\nskins up and down the river. Agricultural products such as corn, rice, dried\npeaches, beans, peanuts, snake root, sarsaparilla, ginseng had grown in\neconomic importance.[13]\n\nOn March 31, 1820, the _Comet_ became the first steamboat to successfully\nnavigate part of the Arkansas River, reaching a place called [Arkansas\nPost](/wiki/Arkansas_Post \"Arkansas Post\"),{{efn|Arkansas Post is said to have\nbeen the first European settlement in the Mississippi Valley,[13] about 60\nmiles (97 km) above the confluence of the Arkansas and the Mississippi\nRivers.[16] In mid-April, 1822, the _Robert Thompson_ , towing a keelboat, was\nthe first steamboat to navigate the Arkansas as far as Fort Smith. For five\nyears, Fort Smith was known as the head of navigation for steamboats on the\nriver.
