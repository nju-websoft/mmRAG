Evaporites are considered [sedimentary\nrocks](/wiki/Sedimentary_rock \"Sedimentary rock\") and are formed by chemical\nsediments.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Formation of evaporite rocks\n  * 2 Evaporite depositional environments\n    * 2.1 Marine evaporites\n    * 2.2 Non-marine evaporites\n  * 3 Evaporitic formations\n  * 4 Economic importance of evaporites\n  * 5 Major groups of evaporite minerals\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n\n## Formation of evaporite\nrocks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evaporite&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section:\nFormation of evaporite rocks\")]\n\nAlthough all water bodies on the surface and in aquifers contain dissolved\nsalts, the water must evaporate into the atmosphere for the minerals to\nprecipitate. For this to happen, the water body must enter a restricted\nenvironment where water input into this environment remains below the net rate\nof evaporation. This is usually an [arid](/wiki/Arid \"Arid\") environment with\na small basin fed by a limited input of water. When evaporation occurs, the\nremaining water is enriched in salts, and they precipitate when the water\nbecomes supersaturated.\n\n## Evaporite depositional\nenvironments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evaporite&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Evaporite depositional environments\")]\n\n### Marine\nevaporites[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evaporite&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Marine evaporites\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Anhydrite_HMNH1.jpg/220px-\nAnhydrite_HMNH1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Anhydrite_HMNH1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Anhydrite_HMNH1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAnhydrite\n\nMarine evaporites tend to have thicker deposits and are usually the focus of\nmore extensive research.[2] They also have a system of evaporation. When\nscientists evaporate ocean water in a laboratory, the minerals are deposited\nin a defined order that was first demonstrated by Usiglio in 1884.[2] The\nfirst phase of the experiment begins when about 50% of the original water\ndepth remains. At this point, minor [carbonates](/wiki/Carbonate \"Carbonate\")\nbegin to form.[2] The next phase in the sequence comes when the experiment is\nleft with about 20% of its original level. At this point, the mineral\n[gypsum](/wiki/Gypsum \"Gypsum\") begins to form, which is then followed by\n[halite](/wiki/Halite \"Halite\") at 10%,[2] excluding carbonate minerals that\ntend not to be evaporites. The most common minerals that are generally\nconsidered to be the most representative of marine evaporites are\n[calcite](/wiki/Calcite \"Calcite\"), [gypsum](/wiki/Gypsum \"Gypsum\") and\n[anhydrite](/wiki/Anhydrite \"Anhydrite\"), [halite](/wiki/Halite \"Halite\"),\n[sylvite](/wiki/Sylvite \"Sylvite\"), [carnallite](/wiki/Carnallite\n\"Carnallite\"), [langbeinite](/wiki/Langbeinite \"Langbeinite\"),\n[polyhalite](/wiki/Polyhalite \"Polyhalite\"), and [kainite](/wiki/Kainite\n\"Kainite\"). [Kieserite](/wiki/Kieserite \"Kieserite\") (MgSO4) may also be\nincluded, which often will make up less than four percent of the overall\ncontent.[2] However, there are approximately 80 different minerals that have\nbeen reported found in evaporite deposits (Stewart,1963;Warren,1999), though\nonly about a dozen are common enough to be considered important rock\nformers.[2]\n\n### Non-marine\nevaporites[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evaporite&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Non-marine evaporites\")]\n\nNon-marine evaporites are usually composed of minerals that are not common in\nmarine environments because in general the water from which non-marine\nevaporite precipitates has proportions of chemical elements different from\nthose found in the marine environments.[2] Common minerals that are found in\nthese deposits include [blödite](/wiki/Bl%C3%B6dite \"Blödite\"),\n[borax](/wiki/Borax \"Borax\"), [epsomite](/wiki/Epsomite \"Epsomite\"),\n[gaylussite](/wiki/Gaylussite \"Gaylussite\"), [glauberite](/wiki/Glauberite\n\"Glauberite\"), [mirabilite](/wiki/Mirabilite \"Mirabilite\"),\n[thenardite](/wiki/Thenardite \"Thenardite\") and [trona](/wiki/Trona \"Trona\").\nNon-marine deposits may also contain halite, gypsum, and anhydrite, and may in\nsome cases even be dominated by these minerals, although they did not come\nfrom ocean deposits. This, however, does not make non-marine deposits any less\nimportant; these deposits often help to paint a picture into past Earth\nclimates. Some particular deposits even show important tectonic and climatic\nchanges. These deposits also may contain important minerals that help in\ntoday's economy.[3] Thick non-marine deposits that accumulate tend to form\nwhere evaporation rates will exceed the inflow rate, and where there is\nsufficient soluble supplies. The inflow also has to occur in a closed basin,\nor one with restricted outflow, so that the sediment has time to pool and form\nin a lake or other standing body of water.[3] Primary examples of this are\ncalled \"saline lake deposits\".[3] Saline lakes includes things such as\nperennial lakes, which are lakes that are there year-round, playa lakes, which\nare lakes that appear only during certain seasons, or any other terms that are\nused to define places that hold standing bodies of water intermittently or\nyear-round. Examples of modern non-marine depositional environments include\nthe [Great Salt Lake](/wiki/Great_Salt_Lake \"Great Salt Lake\") in Utah and the\n[Dead Sea](/wiki/Dead_Sea \"Dead Sea\"), which lies between Jordan and Israel.\n\nEvaporite [depositional\nenvironments](/wiki/Sedimentary_depositional_environment \"Sedimentary\ndepositional environment\") that meet the above conditions include:\n\n  * [Graben](/wiki/Graben \"Graben\") areas and [half-grabens](/wiki/Half-graben \"Half-graben\") within continental [rift](/wiki/Rift_\\(geology\\) \"Rift \\(geology\\)\") environments fed by limited riverine drainage, usually in subtropical or tropical environments \n    * Example environments at the present that match this is the [Denakil Depression](/wiki/Denakil_Depression \"Denakil Depression\"), Ethiopia; [Death Valley](/wiki/Death_Valley \"Death Valley\"), [California](/wiki/California \"California\")\n  * Graben environments in oceanic rift environments fed by limited oceanic input, leading to eventual isolation and evaporation \n    * Examples include the Red Sea, and the [Dead Sea](/wiki/Dead_Sea \"Dead Sea\") in Jordan and Israel\n  * Internal drainage basins in arid to semi-arid temperate to tropical environments fed by ephemeral drainage \n    * Example environments at the present include the [Simpson Desert](/wiki/Simpson_Desert \"Simpson Desert\"), [Western Australia](/wiki/Western_Australia \"Western Australia\"), the [Great Salt Lake](/wiki/Great_Salt_Lake \"Great Salt Lake\") in [Utah](/wiki/Utah \"Utah\")\n  * Non-basin areas fed exclusively by groundwater seepage from artesian waters \n    * Example environments include the seep-mounds of the Victoria Desert, fed by the [Great Artesian Basin](/wiki/Great_Artesian_Basin \"Great Artesian Basin\"), Australia\n  * Restricted coastal plains in regressive sea environments \n    * Examples include the [sabkha](/wiki/Sabkha \"Sabkha\") deposits of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the Red Sea; the [Garabogazköl](/wiki/Garabogazk%C3%B6l \"Garabogazköl\") of the [Caspian Sea](/wiki/Caspian_Sea \"Caspian Sea\")\n  * Drainage basins feeding into extremely arid environments \n    * Examples include the Chilean deserts, certain parts of the [Sahara](/wiki/Sahara \"Sahara\"), and the [Namib](/wiki/Namib \"Namib\")\n\nThe most significant known evaporite depositions happened during the\n[Messinian salinity crisis](/wiki/Messinian_salinity_crisis \"Messinian\nsalinity crisis\") in the basin of the [Mediterranean](/wiki/Mediterranean\n\"Mediterranean\").\n\n## Evaporitic\nformations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evaporite&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Evaporitic formations\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/SaltCrystalCasts.JPG/220px-\nSaltCrystalCasts.JPG)](/wiki/File:SaltCrystalCasts.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:SaltCrystalCasts.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nHopper crystal cast of [halite](/wiki/Halite \"Halite\") in a\n[Jurassic](/wiki/Jurassic \"Jurassic\") rock, Carmel Formation, southwestern\nUtah\n\nEvaporite formations need not be composed entirely of [halite](/wiki/Halite\n\"Halite\") salt. In fact, most evaporite formations do not contain more than a\nfew percent of evaporite minerals, the remainder being composed of the more\ntypical [detrital](/wiki/Detrital \"Detrital\") [clastic](/wiki/Clastic\n\"Clastic\") rocks and [carbonates](/wiki/Carbonate \"Carbonate\"). Examples of\nevaporite formations include occurrences of evaporite sulfur in Eastern Europe\nand West Asia.[4]\n\nFor a formation to be recognised as evaporitic it may simply require\nrecognition of halite [pseudomorphs](/wiki/Pseudomorph \"Pseudomorph\"),\nsequences composed of some proportion of evaporite minerals, and recognition\nof mud crack textures or other [textures](/wiki/Rock_microstructure \"Rock\nmicrostructure\").\n\n## Economic importance of\nevaporites[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evaporite&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Economic importance of evaporites\")]\n\nEvaporites are important economically because of their mineralogy, their\nphysical properties in-situ, and their behaviour within the subsurface.\n\nEvaporite minerals, especially nitrate minerals, are economically important in\nPeru and Chile. Nitrate minerals are often mined for use in the production on\n[fertilizer](/wiki/Fertilizer \"Fertilizer\") and [explosives](/wiki/Explosive\n\"Explosive\").\n\nThick halite deposits are expected to become an important location for the\ndisposal of [nuclear waste](/wiki/Nuclear_waste \"Nuclear waste\") because of\ntheir geologic stability, predictable engineering and physical behaviour, and\nimperviousness to groundwater.\n\nHalite formations are famous for their ability to form [diapirs](/wiki/Diapir\n\"Diapir\"), which produce ideal locations for trapping\n[petroleum](/wiki/Petroleum \"Petroleum\") deposits.\n\nHalite deposits are often mined for use as [salt](/wiki/Salt \"Salt\").\n\n## Major groups of evaporite\nminerals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evaporite&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Major groups of evaporite minerals\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Calcite-k270c.jpg/220px-\nCalcite-k270c.jpg)](/wiki/File:Calcite-k270c.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Calcite-k270c.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCalcite\n\nThis is a chart that shows minerals that form the marine evaporite rocks, they\nare usually the most common minerals that appear in this kind of deposit.\n\nMineral class | Mineral name | Chemical Composition  \n---|---|---  \nChlorides | Halite Sylvite Carnallite Kainite | NaCl KCl KMgCl3 * 6H2O KMg(SO4)Cl * 3H2O  \nSulfates | Anhydrite Gypsum Kieserite Langbeinite Polyhalite | CaSO4 CaSO4 * 2H2O MgSO4 * H2O K2Mg2(SO4)3 K2Ca2Mg(SO4)6 * H2O  \nCarbonates | Dolomite Calcite Magnesite | CaMg(CO3)2 CaCO3 MgCO3  \n  \n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Hanksite.JPG/220px-\nHanksite.JPG)](/wiki/File:Hanksite.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hanksite.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Hanksite](/wiki/Hanksite \"Hanksite\"), Na22K(SO4)9(CO3)2Cl, one of the few\nminerals that is both a carbonate and a sulfate\n\n  * [Halides](/wiki/Halide_mineral \"Halide mineral\"): [halite](/wiki/Halite \"Halite\"), [sylvite](/wiki/Sylvite \"Sylvite\") (KCl), and [fluorite](/wiki/Fluorite \"Fluorite\")\n  * [Sulfates](/wiki/Sulfate_mineral \"Sulfate mineral\"): such as [gypsum](/wiki/Gypsum \"Gypsum\"), [barite](/wiki/Barite \"Barite\"), and [anhydrite](/wiki/Anhydrite \"Anhydrite\")\n  * [Nitrates](/wiki/Nitrate_mineral \"Nitrate mineral\"): [nitratine](/wiki/Nitratine \"Nitratine\") (soda niter) and [niter](/wiki/Niter \"Niter\")\n  * [Borates](/wiki/Borate_mineral \"Borate mineral\"): typically found in arid-salt-lake deposits plentiful in the southwestern [US](/wiki/United_States \"United States\").

[Calcite](/wiki/Calcite \"Calcite\") (CaCO3) and [dolomite](/wiki/Dolomite \"Dolomite\") (CaMg(CO3)2)\n  2. Gypsum (CaSO4-2H2O) and anhydrite (CaSO4).\n  3. Halite (i.e. common salt, NaCl)\n  4. [Potassium](/wiki/Potassium \"Potassium\") and [magnesium](/wiki/Magnesium \"Magnesium\") salts\n\nThe abundance of rocks formed by seawater precipitation is in the same order\nas the precipitation given above. Thus, [limestone](/wiki/Limestone\n\"Limestone\") ([calcite](/wiki/Calcite \"Calcite\")) and\n[dolomite](/wiki/Dolomite \"Dolomite\") are more common than\n[gypsum](/wiki/Gypsum \"Gypsum\"), which is more common than\n[halite](/wiki/Halite \"Halite\"), which is more common than\n[potassium](/wiki/Potassium \"Potassium\") and [magnesium](/wiki/Magnesium\n\"Magnesium\") salts.\n\nEvaporites can also be easily\n[recrystallized](/wiki/Recrystallization_\\(chemistry\\) \"Recrystallization\n\\(chemistry\\)\") in laboratories in order to investigate the conditions and\ncharacteristics of their formation.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evaporite&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | Wikimedia Commons has media related to _**[Evaporite](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Evaporite \"commons:Category:Evaporite\")**_.  \n---|---  \n  \n  * [List of minerals](/wiki/List_of_minerals \"List of minerals\")\n  * [List of rock types](/wiki/List_of_rock_types \"List of rock types\")\n  * [Salt dome](/wiki/Salt_dome \"Salt dome\")\n  * [Diapir](/wiki/Diapir \"Diapir\")\n  * [Tectonic rifts](/wiki/Rift_\\(geology\\) \"Rift \\(geology\\)\")\n  * [Graben](/wiki/Graben \"Graben\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evaporite&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Jackson, Julia A., 1997, Glossary of Geology 4th edition, American Geologic Institute, Alexandria Virginia\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ Boggs, S., 2006, Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy (4th ed.), Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 662 p.\n  3. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Melvin, J.
