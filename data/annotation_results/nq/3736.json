The series began with French\nauthor [Pierre Boulle](/wiki/Pierre_Boulle \"Pierre Boulle\")'s 1963 novel _[La\nPlanète des Singes](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(novel\\) \"Planet of the Apes\n\\(novel\\)\")_ , translated into English as _Planet of the Apes_ or _Monkey\nPlanet_. The 1968 film adaptation, _[Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(1968_film\\) \"Planet of the Apes \\(1968\nfilm\\)\")_ , was a critical and commercial hit, initiating a series of sequels,\ntie-ins, and derivative works. [Arthur P. Jacobs](/wiki/Arthur_P._Jacobs\n\"Arthur P. Jacobs\") produced the series under APJAC Productions until his\ndeath in 1973; since then [20th Century Fox](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox \"20th\nCentury Fox\") has owned the franchise.\n\nFour sequels followed the original film between 1970 and 1973: _[Beneath the\nPlanet of the Apes](/wiki/Beneath_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Beneath the Planet\nof the Apes\")_ , _[Escape from the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Escape_from_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Escape from the Planet of the\nApes\")_ , _[Conquest of the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Conquest of the Planet of the\nApes\")_ , and _[Battle for the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Battle_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Battle for the Planet of the\nApes\")_. They did not approach the critical acclaim of the original, but were\ncommercially successful. The series also spawned two television series in 1974\nand 1975. Plans for a film remake stalled in \"[development\nhell](/wiki/Development_hell \"Development hell\")\" for over ten years before\n[Tim Burton](/wiki/Tim_Burton \"Tim Burton\")'s _[Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(2001_film\\) \"Planet of the Apes \\(2001\nfilm\\)\")_ was released in 2001. A new [reboot](/wiki/Reboot_\\(fiction\\)\n\"Reboot \\(fiction\\)\") film series commenced in 2011 with _[Rise of the Planet\nof the Apes](/wiki/Rise_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Rise of the Planet of the\nApes\")_ , which was followed by _[Dawn of the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\")_\nin 2014 and _[War for the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/War_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"War for the Planet of the Apes\")_\nin 2017. The films have grossed a total of over $2 billion worldwide, against\na combined budget of $567.5 million. Other media and merchandising tie-ins\ninclude books, comics, video games, and toys.\n\n_Planet of the Apes_ has received particular attention for its treatment of\n[race](/wiki/Race_\\(human_categorization\\) \"Race \\(human categorization\\)\"),\nwhich critics consider its primary theme. Critics have also written on its\n[Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\") and [animal rights](/wiki/Animal_rights\n\"Animal rights\") themes. The series has had a wide influence on subsequent\nfilms, media, and art, as well as popular culture and political discourse.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 _La Planète des Singes_\n  * 2 Original film series\n    * 2.1 _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)\n    * 2.2 _Beneath the Planet of the Apes_ (1970)\n    * 2.3 _Escape from the Planet of the Apes_ (1971)\n    * 2.4 _Conquest of the Planet of the Apes_ (1972)\n    * 2.5 _Battle for the Planet of the Apes_ (1973)\n  * 3 Television series\n    * 3.1 _Planet of the Apes_ TV series\n    * 3.2 Animated series\n      * 3.2.1 _Return to the Planet of the Apes_\n  * 4 Remake film\n    * 4.1 Planned relaunch and \"development hell\"\n    * 4.2 _Planet of the Apes_ (2001)\n  * 5 Reboot film series\n    * 5.1 _Rise of the Planet of the Apes_ (2011)\n    * 5.2 _Dawn of the Planet of the Apes_ (2014)\n    * 5.3 _War for the Planet of the Apes_ (2017)\n    * 5.4 Possible fourth film\n  * 6 Other media and merchandise\n    * 6.1 Books\n    * 6.2 Comics\n    * 6.3 Toys and merchandise\n    * 6.4 Theme park ride\n    * 6.5 Video games\n  * 7 Themes\n  * 8 Cultural impact and legacy\n  * 9 List of media\n    * 9.1 Feature films\n  * 10 Reception\n    * 10.1 Box office performance\n    * 10.2 Critical and public response\n  * 11 Characters\n    * 11.1 Humans\n    * 11.2 Apes\n  * 12 Crew and other\n  * 13 Footnotes\n  * 14 References\n  * 15 External links\n\n## _La Planète des\nSinges_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: La Planète des Singes\")]\n\nMain article: [Planet of the Apes (novel)](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(novel\\)\n\"Planet of the Apes \\(novel\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Planet_of_the_Apes_book_cover.jpg/200px-\nPlanet_of_the_Apes_book_cover.jpg)](/wiki/File:Planet_of_the_Apes_book_cover.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Planet_of_the_Apes_book_cover.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFirst American edition of Boulle's novel, titled _Planet of the Apes_\n\nThe series began with French author [Pierre Boulle](/wiki/Pierre_Boulle\n\"Pierre Boulle\")'s 1963 novel _[La Planète des\nSinges](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(novel\\) \"Planet of the Apes \\(novel\\)\")_.\nBoulle wrote the novel in six months after the \"humanlike expressions\" of\ngorillas at the zoo inspired him to contemplate the relationship between man\nand ape. _La Planète des Singes_ was heavily influenced by 18th- and 19th-\ncentury fantastical [travel narratives](/wiki/Travel_narrative \"Travel\nnarrative\"), especially [Jonathan Swift](/wiki/Jonathan_Swift \"Jonathan\nSwift\")'s satirical _[Gulliver's Travels](/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels\n\"Gulliver's Travels\")_. It is one of several of Boulle's works to use science\nfiction tropes and plot devices to comment on the failings of human nature and\nmankind's overreliance on technology. However, Boulle rejected the science\nfiction label for his work, instead terming it \"social fantasy\".[1]\n\nThe novel is a social satire following French journalist Ulysse Mérou, who\nparticipates in a voyage to a distant planet where speechless, animalistic\nhumans are hunted and enslaved by an advanced society of apes. Eventually\nMérou discovers that humans once dominated the planet until their complacency\nallowed the more industrious apes to overthrow them. The novel's central\nmessage is that human intelligence is not a fixed quality and could atrophy if\ntaken for granted.[1][2] Boulle considered the novel one of his minor works,\nthough it proved to be a hit. [Xan Fielding](/wiki/Xan_Fielding \"Xan\nFielding\") translated it into English; it was published in the United Kingdom\nas _Monkey Planet_ and in the United States as _Planet of the Apes_.[3]\n\n## Original film\nseries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Original film series\")]\n\nBoulle's literary agent Allain Bernheim brought the novel to the attention of\nAmerican film producer [Arthur P. Jacobs](/wiki/Arthur_P._Jacobs \"Arthur P.\nJacobs\"), who had come to Paris looking for new properties to adapt with his\nnew company, APJAC Productions. To explain his interests, Jacobs had mentioned\nto agents, \"I wish _[King Kong](/wiki/King_Kong_\\(1933_film\\) \"King Kong\n\\(1933 film\\)\")_ hadn't been made so I could make it.\" Bernheim initially\napproached Jacobs about a [Françoise Sagan](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_Sagan\n\"Françoise Sagan\") novel, which Jacobs turned down. Remembering Jacobs'\nearlier comment about _King Kong_ , Bernheim mentioned _La Planète des Singes_\n, not expecting Jacobs would be interested. However, the story intrigued\nJacobs, who bought the film rights immediately.[4]\n\n### _Planet of the Apes_\n(1968)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Planet of the Apes \\(1968\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Planet of the Apes (1968\nfilm)](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(1968_film\\) \"Planet of the Apes \\(1968\nfilm\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Charlton_Heston_Civil_Rights_March_1963.jpg/150px-\nCharlton_Heston_Civil_Rights_March_1963.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charlton_Heston_Civil_Rights_March_1963.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charlton_Heston_Civil_Rights_March_1963.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Charlton Heston](/wiki/Charlton_Heston \"Charlton Heston\"), star of _Planet of\nthe Apes_\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Franklin_J._Schaffner.jpg/150px-\nFranklin_J._Schaffner.jpg)](/wiki/File:Franklin_J._Schaffner.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Franklin_J._Schaffner.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Franklin J. Schaffner](/wiki/Franklin_J._Schaffner \"Franklin J. Schaffner\"),\ndirector of _Planet of the Apes_\n\nAfter optioning the novel's film rights, Arthur P. Jacobs spent over three\nyears trying to convince filmmakers to take on the project. He hired a\nsuccession of artists to create test sketches, and hired veteran television\nwriter [Rod Serling](/wiki/Rod_Serling \"Rod Serling\"), creator of _[The\nTwilight Zone](/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone \"The Twilight Zone\")_ , to pen the\nscript.[5][6] Serling's script changed elements of Boulle's novel, introducing\n[Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\") themes; notably he wrote a new twist\nending that revealed the planet to be a future Earth where humans had\ndestroyed themselves through [nuclear warfare](/wiki/Nuclear_warfare \"Nuclear\nwarfare\").[7] As production costs were estimated at over $10 million, no\nstudio in either Hollywood or Europe would assume the risk. Jacobs and\nassociate producer [Mort Abrahams](/wiki/Mort_Abrahams \"Mort Abrahams\")\npersevered, and eventually persuaded [Charlton Heston](/wiki/Charlton_Heston\n\"Charlton Heston\") to star; Heston in turn recommended director [Franklin J.\nSchaffner](/wiki/Franklin_J._Schaffner \"Franklin J. Schaffner\"). The team\nrecorded a brief [screen test](/wiki/Screen_test \"Screen test\") featuring\nHeston, which ultimately convinced [20th Century Fox](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox\n\"20th Century Fox\") the film could succeed.[5]\n\nFox insisted on changes to reduce the budget to a more manageable $5.8\nmillion.[8] The producers hired veteran writer [Michael\nWilson](/wiki/Michael_Wilson_\\(writer\\) \"Michael Wilson \\(writer\\)\"), who had\npreviously [adapted](/wiki/The_Bridge_on_the_River_Kwai \"The Bridge on the\nRiver Kwai\") Boulle's novel _[The Bridge over the River\nKwai](/wiki/The_Bridge_over_the_River_Kwai \"The Bridge over the River Kwai\")_\n, to rewrite Serling's script.[9][10] To save on special effects costs,\nWilson's script described an ape society more primitive than that which\nappeared in the novel.[10][11] The new script changed much of the plot and\ndialogue, but retained the Cold War themes and Serling's ending.[11][12] [John\nChambers](/wiki/John_Chambers_\\(make-up_artist\\) \"John Chambers \\(make-up\nartist\\)\") created the innovative makeup effects.[13]\n\nHeston played 20th-century American astronaut [George\nTaylor](/wiki/George_Taylor_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"George Taylor \\(Planet of\nthe Apes\\)\"), who travels to a strange planet where intelligent apes dominate\nmute, primitive humans. [Kim Hunter](/wiki/Kim_Hunter \"Kim Hunter\") and [Roddy\nMcDowall](/wiki/Roddy_McDowall \"Roddy McDowall\") played the sympathetic\nchimpanzees [Zira](/wiki/Zira_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Zira \\(Planet of the\nApes\\)\") and [Cornelius](/wiki/Cornelius_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Cornelius\n\\(Planet of the Apes\\)\"), and [Linda\nHarrison](/wiki/Linda_Harrison_\\(actress\\) \"Linda Harrison \\(actress\\)\")\nportrayed Taylor's love interest [Nova](/wiki/Nova_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\)\n\"Nova \\(Planet of the Apes\\)\"). [Maurice Evans](/wiki/Maurice_Evans_\\(actor\\)\n\"Maurice Evans \\(actor\\)\") played the villain, orangutan science minister [Dr.\nZaius](/wiki/Dr._Zaius \"Dr. Zaius\").[14] The finale, in which Taylor comes\nupon a ruined [Statue of Liberty](/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty \"Statue of Liberty\")\nand realizes he has been on Earth all along, became the series' defining scene\nand one of the most iconic images in 1960s film.[15] The film was released on\nFebruary 8, 1968, and was a smash success with both critics and audiences,\nbreaking contemporary box office records and earning rave reviews.[16] John\nChambers received an honorary Oscar at the [41st Academy\nAwards](/wiki/41st_Academy_Awards \"41st Academy Awards\") for his make-up\neffects, the first ever given to a make-up artist.[13] [Jerry\nGoldsmith](/wiki/Jerry_Goldsmith \"Jerry Goldsmith\")'s score and [Morton\nHaack](/wiki/Morton_Haack \"Morton Haack\")'s costume design also earned Oscar\nnominations.[17] Fox approached Jacobs and Abrahams about filming a sequel.\nThough they had not made the film with sequels in mind, its success led them\nto consider the prospect.[16]\n\n### _Beneath the Planet of the Apes_\n(1970)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Beneath the Planet of the Apes \\(1970\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Beneath the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Beneath_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Kim_Hunter_%28A_Streetcar_Named_Desire%2C_1951%29.jpg/150px-\nKim_Hunter_%28A_Streetcar_Named_Desire%2C_1951%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Kim_Hunter_\\(A_Streetcar_Named_Desire,_1951\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kim_Hunter_\\(A_Streetcar_Named_Desire,_1951\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Kim Hunter](/wiki/Kim_Hunter \"Kim Hunter\") played\n[Zira](/wiki/Zira_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Zira \\(Planet of the Apes\\)\") in the\nfirst three films\n\nPlanning for the sequel, eventually titled _[Beneath the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Beneath_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\")_\n, began two months after the original film's release. Jacobs and Abrahams\ninitially considered several treatments by Rod Serling and Pierre Boulle, but\nultimately turned them down.[18] In fall 1968 the producers hired [Paul\nDehn](/wiki/Paul_Dehn \"Paul Dehn\") to write the script; he would become the\nprimary writer for the franchise.[19][20] Charlton Heston was uninterested in\na sequel, but agreed to shoot a few scenes if his character were killed off\nand his salary donated to charity.[21] In one of many major rewrites, Dehn\naltered the script to center on a new character,\n[Brent](/wiki/Brent_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Brent \\(Planet of the Apes\\)\"),\nplayed by [James Franciscus](/wiki/James_Franciscus \"James Franciscus\").[22]\nWith director Franklin J. Shaffner unavailable, owing to his work on\n_[Patton](/wiki/Patton_\\(film\\) \"Patton \\(film\\)\")_ , the producers hired [Ted\nPost](/wiki/Ted_Post \"Ted Post\") on January 8, 1969.[23] Post struggled with\nthe material, especially after the studio cut the budget to $3.4 million.[24]\n\nThe story follows Franciscus' character Brent, an astronaut who inadvertently\nfollows Taylor into the future while searching for him. After encountering the\napes from the first film, Brent finds Taylor imprisoned by a colony of\nsubterranean human mutants who worship an ancient [nuclear\nbomb](/wiki/Nuclear_bomb \"Nuclear bomb\"). Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, and Linda\nHarrison returned as Zira, Zaius, and Nova.[25] [David\nWatson](/wiki/David_Watson_\\(actor\\) \"David Watson \\(actor\\)\") replaced Roddy\nMcDowall as Cornelius, as McDowall was unavailable due to a scheduling\nconflict.[26] [James Gregory](/wiki/James_Gregory_\\(actor\\) \"James Gregory\n\\(actor\\)\") played gorilla [General Ursus](/wiki/General_Ursus \"General\nUrsus\") and [Paul Richards](/wiki/Paul_Richards_\\(actor\\) \"Paul Richards\n\\(actor\\)\") played mutant leader\n[Méndez](/wiki/M%C3%A9ndez_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Méndez \\(Planet of the\nApes\\)\"). The film opened on May 26, 1970.[25] Unlike the first film,\n_Beneath_ was poorly reviewed; critics typically regard it as the worst of the\n_Apes_ sequels other than the fifth film, _[Battle for the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Battle_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Battle for the Planet of the\nApes\")_.[27] However, it was a major box office hit, nearing the original's\nnumbers. Despite a conclusion depicting the planet's nuclear destruction, Fox\nrequested another sequel, creating a series.[28][29]\n\n### _Escape from the Planet of the Apes_\n(1971)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Escape from the Planet of the Apes \\(1971\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Escape from the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Escape_from_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Escape from the Planet of the\nApes\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/RoddyMcDowall.jpg/150px-\nRoddyMcDowall.jpg)](/wiki/File:RoddyMcDowall.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:RoddyMcDowall.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Roddy McDowall](/wiki/Roddy_McDowall \"Roddy McDowall\") returned as\n[Cornelius](/wiki/Cornelius_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Cornelius \\(Planet of the\nApes\\)\") in _Escape from the Planet of the Apes_. He would go on to star in\ntwo additional _Apes_ films and the live-action television series\n\nFollowing the financial success of _Beneath_ , Arthur P. Jacobs recruited Paul\nDehn to write a new script with a brief telegram: \"Apes exist, Sequel\nrequired.\" Dehn immediately started work on what became _[Escape from the\nPlanet of the Apes](/wiki/Escape_from_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Escape from the\nPlanet of the Apes\")_. The producers hired a new director, [Don\nTaylor](/wiki/Don_Taylor_\\(American_actor_and_director\\) \"Don Taylor\n\\(American actor and director\\)\").[29] Fox gave the production a greatly\ndiminished budget ($2.5 million), which required a tight production\nschedule.[30]\n\nTo work around the budget, as well as _Beneath_ 's seemingly definitive\nending, the film took the series in a new direction by transporting Zira (Kim\nHunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall, returning to the role after being\nabsent from _Beneath_) back in time to the contemporary United States,\nreducing the need for expensive sets and ape make-up effects.[24] In the film,\nZira and Cornelius are initially accepted by American society, but fears that\ntheir child will bring about the domination of the human race by evolved apes\nleads to conflict. Jacob's wife [Natalie Trundy](/wiki/Natalie_Trundy \"Natalie\nTrundy\"), who appeared as a mutant in _Beneath_ and later played the ape\n[Lisa](/wiki/Lisa_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Lisa \\(Planet of the Apes\\)\") in the\nnext two sequels, was cast as Dr. Stephanie Branton.[31] [Bradford\nDillman](/wiki/Bradford_Dillman \"Bradford Dillman\") played Dr. Lewis Dixon,\n[Ricardo Montalbán](/wiki/Ricardo_Montalb%C3%A1n \"Ricardo Montalbán\") played\n[Armando](/wiki/Armando_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Armando \\(Planet of the\nApes\\)\"), and [Eric Braeden](/wiki/Eric_Braeden \"Eric Braeden\") portrayed the\nvillain, the President's Science Advisor [Otto Hasslein](/wiki/Otto_Hasslein\n\"Otto Hasslein\").[32]\n\nCompared to its predecessors, _Escape_ dwelt more heavily on themes of racial\nconflict, which became a primary focus through the rest of the series.[33] The\nfilm opened on May 21, 1971, less than a year after _Beneath_. It was well\nreceived by critics.[34] From this point critics began seeing the films less\nas independent units and more as installments in a greater work; Frederick S.\nClarke wrote that the burgeoning series had \"the promise of being the first\nepic of filmed science fiction.\"[35] It also performed well at the box office,\nthough not as strongly as its predecessors. Fox ordered a third sequel.[36]\n\n### _Conquest of the Planet of the Apes_\n(1972)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Conquest of the Planet of the Apes \\(1972\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Conquest of the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Conquest of the Planet of the\nApes\")\n\nBased on the strong positive response to _Escape_ , Fox ordered _[Conquest of\nthe Planet of the Apes](/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Conquest of\nthe Planet of the Apes\")_ , though it provided a comparatively low budget of\n$1.7 million.[36] Paul Dehn returned as the scriptwriter, and producer Jacobs\nhired [J. Lee Thompson](/wiki/J._Lee_Thompson \"J. Lee Thompson\") to direct.\nThompson had worked with Jacobs on two earlier films as well as during the\ninitial stages of _Planet_ , but scheduling conflicts had made him unavailable\nduring its long development process.[37] For _Conquest_ , Thompson and Dehn\nfocused heavily on the racial conflict theme, an ancillary concern in the\nearly films that became a major theme in _Escape_.[38] In particular, Dehn\nassociated the apes with African-Americans and modeled the plot after the 1966\n[Watts Riots](/wiki/Watts_Riots \"Watts Riots\") and other episodes from the\n[Civil Rights Movement](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement \"Civil Rights\nMovement\").[37] Roddy McDowall signed on to play\n[Caesar](/wiki/Caesar_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Caesar \\(Planet of the Apes\\)\"),\nthe son of his previous character Cornelius.[39] Ricardo Montalban returned as\nArmando, while [Don Murray](/wiki/Don_Murray_\\(actor\\) \"Don Murray \\(actor\\)\")\nplayed [Governor Breck](/wiki/Governor_Breck \"Governor Breck\"), [Severn\nDarden](/wiki/Severn_Darden \"Severn Darden\") played\n[Kolp](/wiki/Kolp_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Kolp \\(Planet of the Apes\\)\"), and\n[Hari Rhodes](/wiki/Hari_Rhodes \"Hari Rhodes\") played\n[MacDonald](/wiki/MacDonald_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"MacDonald \\(Planet of the\nApes\\)\").[40]\n\nFollowing _Escape_ , _Conquest_ is set in a near future where humans have\nturned apes into slaves; Caesar rises from bondage to lead an ape rebellion.\nThe film opened June 30, 1972.[40] Reviews were mixed. However, the ending\nleft the series open to another sequel, and _Conquest_ was successful enough\nat the box office that Fox greenlit another film.[41]\n\n### _Battle for the Planet of the Apes_\n(1973)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Battle for the Planet of the Apes \\(1973\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Battle for the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Battle_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Battle for the Planet of the\nApes\")\n\nFox approved _[Battle for the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Battle_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Battle for the Planet of the\nApes\")_ with a $1.2 million budget, the lowest of the series.[42] The\nfilmmakers went into the project knowing it would be the last of the\nseries.[43] J. Lee Thompson returned as director. Series writer Paul Dehn\nsubmitted a treatment, but illness forced him to leave the film before\ncompleting the script. The producers subsequently hired [John William\nCorrington](/wiki/John_William_Corrington \"John William Corrington\") and\n[Joyce Hooper Corrington](/wiki/Joyce_Hooper_Corrington \"Joyce Hooper\nCorrington\") to write the screenplay.[44][45] _Battle_ continued _Conquest_ 's\nfocus on racial conflict and domination. However, likely based in part on the\nstudio's wishes, the Corringtons discarded Dehn's pessimistic treatment in\nfavor of a story with a more hopeful, though ambiguous, resolution.[46]\n\n_Battle_ follows Caesar as he leads the apes and their human subjects after a\ndevastating war that destroyed much of the planet. He contends with both an\nattack by radiation-scarred human mutants and a coup attempt as he attempts to\nbuild a better society for both apes and humans. McDowall returned as Caesar,\nand Severn Darden returned as Kolp. [Paul\nWilliams](/wiki/Paul_Williams_\\(songwriter\\) \"Paul Williams \\(songwriter\\)\")\nplayed the orangutan [Virgil](/wiki/Virgil_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Virgil\n\\(Planet of the Apes\\)\"), [Austin Stoker](/wiki/Austin_Stoker \"Austin Stoker\")\nplayed [MacDonald](/wiki/MacDonald_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"MacDonald \\(Planet\nof the Apes\\)\") (the brother of Hari Rhodes' character), and [Claude\nAkins](/wiki/Claude_Akins \"Claude Akins\") played the evil gorilla general\n[Aldo](/wiki/Aldo_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Aldo \\(Planet of the Apes\\)\"). [John\nHuston](/wiki/John_Huston \"John Huston\") played the orangutan\n[Lawgiver](/wiki/Lawgiver_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Lawgiver \\(Planet of the\nApes\\)\") in a [frame narrative](/wiki/Frame_narrative \"Frame narrative\").[47]\nThe film opened May 2, 1973. It made a profit over production costs, but\nreceived poor reviews from critics, who regard it as the weakest of the five\nfilms.[48]\n\nCritics have offered various interpretations of the film's message and its\nsignificance for the series. Particular attention has been paid to the\nambiguous imagery in the ending: set 700 years after the main events, the last\nscene depicts a statue of Caesar shedding a single tear as the Lawgiver\nrecounts Caesar's story to an integrated audience of ape and human children.\nBy one interpretation, the statue cries tears of joy because the species have\nbroken the cycle of oppression, giving the series an optimistic finale. By\nanother, the statue weeps because racial strife still exists, implying the\ndystopian future of _Planet_ and _Beneath_ is unavoidable.[49]\n\n## Television\nseries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Television series\")]\n\n### _Planet of the Apes_ TV\nseries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Planet of the Apes TV series\")]\n\nMain article: [Planet of the Apes (TV\nseries)](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(TV_series\\) \"Planet of the Apes \\(TV\nseries\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Planet_of_the_Apes_cast_1974.JPG/200px-\nPlanet_of_the_Apes_cast_1974.JPG)](/wiki/File:Planet_of_the_Apes_cast_1974.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Planet_of_the_Apes_cast_1974.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe cast of the _Planet of the Apes_ television series: [James\nNaughton](/wiki/James_Naughton \"James Naughton\") as Burke, [Ron\nHarper](/wiki/Ron_Harper_\\(actor\\) \"Ron Harper \\(actor\\)\") as Virdon, and\nRoddy McDowall as Galen\n\nIn addition to their box office grosses, the films earned very high ratings\nwhen broadcast on television after their theatrical run. To capitalize on this\nsuccess, Arthur P. Jacobs conceived of an hour-long live action television\nseries to follow the films. He originally thought of the idea in 1971 during\nthe production of _Conquest_ , which he then anticipated would be the final\nfilm. However, he shelved the project once Fox ordered a fifth film. Jacobs\ndied on June 27, 1973, bringing an end to the APJAC Productions era of the\n_Planet of the Apes_ franchise. Former Fox executive [Stan\nHough](/wiki/Stan_Hough \"Stan Hough\") took over as producer for the television\nproject, titled _[Planet of the Apes](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(TV_series\\)\n\"Planet of the Apes \\(TV series\\)\")_. [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") picked up the\nseries for its 1974 fall lineup.[50]\n\n[Ron Harper](/wiki/Ron_Harper_\\(actor\\) \"Ron Harper \\(actor\\)\") and [James\nNaughton](/wiki/James_Naughton \"James Naughton\") played Alan Virdon and Peter\nBurke, two 20th-century American astronauts who pass through a time warp to a\nfuture where apes subjugate humans (unlike the original film, the humans can\nspeak). Roddy McDowall returned to the franchise as Galen, a chimpanzee who\njoins the astronauts. [Booth Coleman](/wiki/Booth_Coleman \"Booth Coleman\")\nplayed orangutan Councillor [Zaius](/wiki/Zaius \"Zaius\") and [Mark\nLenard](/wiki/Mark_Lenard \"Mark Lenard\") played gorilla General Urko. The\nepisodes portray Virdon, Burke, and Galen as they look for answers, aid\ndowntrodden humans and apes, and avoid the authorities.[51] The show premiered\non September 13, 1974, filling CBS' 8–9 p.m. time slot on Fridays. It earned\nlow ratings during its run, a fact the production team attributed to\nrepetitive storytelling and too little screen time for the apes who made the\nseries famous. Given the considerable production costs, CBS cancelled the show\nafter 14 episodes, the last airing on December 20, 1974.[52][53][54]\n\nIn 1981, Fox reedited ten of the episodes into five [television\nfilms](/wiki/Television_film \"Television film\"). Each film combined two\nepisodes and (in some markets) added new introductory and concluding segments\nstarring Roddy McDowall as an aged Galen. The films were given what scholar\nEric Greene called \"the most outlandish titles of the _Apes_ corpus\": _Back to\nthe Planet of the Apes_ ; _Forgotten City of the Planet of the Apes_ ;\n_Treachery and Greed on the Planet of the Apes_ ; _Life, Liberty and Pursuit\non the Planet of the Apes_ ; and _Farewell to the Planet of the Apes_.[55]\n\nGreene finds the show's timeline significant: set in 3085, it occurs about 900\nyears before Taylor's crash in the original film, and 400 years after the\nLawgiver's sermon in _Battle_. By depicting a future where apes dominate\nhumans, it implies the Lawgiver's message of equality between man and ape has\nfailed, giving weight to the more pessimistic interpretation of _Battle_ 's\nending.[56] Greene writes that the show emphasized the theme of racial\nconflict less than the films had, though the episodes \"The Trap\" and \"The\nLiberator\" made it the central focus.[57] However, the show is actually set in\nthe original timeline, before Caesar came to exist.\n\n### Animated\nseries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Animated series\")]\n\n#### _Return to the Planet of the\nApes_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Return to the Planet of the Apes\")]\n\nMain article: [Return to the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Return_to_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Return to the Planet of the\nApes\")\n\nIn 1975, after the failure of the live-action series, [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\")\ndecided to adapt _Planet of the Apes_ for an animated series. The network\ncontracted [DePatie-Freleng Enterprises](/wiki/DePatie-Freleng_Enterprises\n\"DePatie-Freleng Enterprises\") to produce a half-hour [Saturday morning\ncartoon](/wiki/Saturday_morning_cartoon \"Saturday morning cartoon\") titled\n_[Return to the Planet of the Apes](/wiki/Return_to_the_Planet_of_the_Apes\n\"Return to the Planet of the Apes\")_.

As such, the show\nrelied less on the themes and plot developments from _Escape_ , _Conquest_ ,\nand _Battle_ and instead returned to the [Vietnam War](/wiki/Vietnam_War\n\"Vietnam War\") and Cold War themes prominent in the first two films.[59]\n\nThe plot concerns three American astronauts, Bill Hudson (Tom Williams), Jeff\nAllen ([Austin Stoker](/wiki/Austin_Stoker \"Austin Stoker\"), who played\nMacDonald in _Battle_), and Judy Franklin ([Claudette\nNevins](/wiki/Claudette_Nevins \"Claudette Nevins\")), who inadvertently journey\nto Earth's far future. They find the world populated by three groups: mute\nhumans who inhabit desert caves, subterranean human \"Underdwellers\" fashioned\nafter the mutants of _Beneath_ , and civilized apes who subjugate the humans.\nThrough the show, the astronauts become increasingly involved in the planet's\naffairs and in defending the humans against an ape invasion. The cast featured\ncharacters based on those from the previous films and TV series, including\nNova (Claudette Nevis), General Urko (Henry Cordin), Zira (Philippa Harris),\nCornelius (Edwin Mills), and Dr. Zaius (Richard Blackburn).[60] NBC broadcast\nthirteen episodes between September 6 and November 21, 1975.[61] The show did\nnot achieve particularly strong ratings. The network considered producing a\nsecond three-episode season to complete the story, but this never\nmaterialized.[62]\n\n## Remake\nfilm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Remake film\")]\n\n### Planned relaunch and \"development\nhell\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Planned relaunch and \"development hell\"\")]\n\nFox initiated plans to relaunch the _Planet of the Apes_ series in the 1980s,\nbut the project fell into \"[development hell](/wiki/Development_hell\n\"Development hell\")\" for over ten years, experiencing one of the most\nprotracted development periods in film history. It began in 1988, when Fox\nannounced [Adam Rifkin](/wiki/Adam_Rifkin \"Adam Rifkin\"), then a 21-year-old\n[independent film](/wiki/Independent_film \"Independent film\") director, would\ndevelop a new _Apes_ film. At a Fox executive's invitation, Rifkin pitched a\nconcept for _Return to the Planet of the Apes_ , an alternative sequel to\n_Planet_ that ignored the other four films. In Rifkin's initial concept,\nTaylor's descendant Duke launches a [Spartacus](/wiki/Spartacus\n\"Spartacus\")-like uprising against Roman-inspired ape oppressors led by\nGeneral Izan. The project nearly entered [pre-production](/wiki/Pre-production\n\"Pre-production\"), but days before, Fox brought in new studio executives who\nsent the project back to development.[63] They commissioned Rifkin to rewrite\nthe script through several drafts, but found them unsatisfactory and\nultimately scrapped the project.[64]\n\nAfter several years in limbo, Fox returned to the _Apes_ concept, this time\nwith [Oliver Stone](/wiki/Oliver_Stone \"Oliver Stone\") as a producer. Stone\nbrought in [Terry Hayes](/wiki/Terry_Hayes \"Terry Hayes\") as screenwriter, and\nthey developed a script titled _Return of the Apes_.[65] In their script,\nhumanity is threatened by an ailment encoded in their DNA, so two scientists\ngo back in time thousands of years to stop it at its origin. They discover the\ndisease was engineered by advanced apes to ensure humanity's eventual\ndestruction.[66] [Arnold Schwarzenegger](/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger \"Arnold\nSchwarzenegger\") committed to star as scientist Will Robinson, while [Philip\nNoyce](/wiki/Philip_Noyce \"Philip Noyce\") agreed to direct. The draft\nimpressed Fox president [Peter Chernin](/wiki/Peter_Chernin \"Peter Chernin\"),\nbut other executives were ambivalent about the action script, believing it\nshould be lighter. Notably, executive Dylan Sellers insisted the script\ninclude a comic scene involving apes playing baseball as his \"stamp\" on the\nfilm, and fired Hayes when he left it out. This move caused Noyce to quit as\nwell, and subsequently almost everyone involved in the project left for one\nreason or another.[65]\n\nAfter the collapse of the Stone-Hayes project, Fox brought on [Chris\nColumbus](/wiki/Chris_Columbus_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Chris Columbus \\(filmmaker\\)\")\nto develop a new _Apes_ concept. Columbus hired [Sam Hamm](/wiki/Sam_Hamm \"Sam\nHamm\") to write a new draft taking elements from Boulle's novel and various\nunused scripts. In Hamm's script, an ape astronaut from a distant planet\nunleashes a devastating virus on Earth. Scientists go to the astronaut's\nplanet, where apes hunt humans; they locate a cure, but return to find Earth\noverrun by simians. Schwarzenegger remained attached, but Fox found the script\nunderwhelming. Columbus left the project in 1995 after his mother's death, and\n[James Cameron](/wiki/James_Cameron \"James Cameron\") stepped in to produce.\nCameron intended to go in a \"very different direction\" with the script, but\nfollowing the critical and financial success of his film\n_[Titanic](/wiki/Titanic_\\(1997_film\\) \"Titanic \\(1997 film\\)\")_ , he dropped\nout of the project. Fox approached a series of directors to take over, without\nsuccess. By 1999 the studio decided once again to go in a new direction.[67]\n\n### _Planet of the Apes_\n(2001)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Planet of the Apes \\(2001\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Planet of the Apes (2001\nfilm)](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(2001_film\\) \"Planet of the Apes \\(2001\nfilm\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Tim_Burton_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/150px-\nTim_Burton_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tim_Burton_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tim_Burton_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Tim Burton](/wiki/Tim_Burton \"Tim Burton\"), director of the 2001 _Planet of\nthe Apes_\n\nIn 1999, Fox hired [William Broyles, Jr.](/wiki/William_Broyles,_Jr. \"William\nBroyles, Jr.\") to write a new script. Fox insisted on a July 2001 release\ndate, but otherwise offered considerable creative control.[67] This prospect\nattracted director [Tim Burton](/wiki/Tim_Burton \"Tim Burton\"), who hoped to\ndo a \"re-imagining\" of _Planet of the Apes_. However, Burton found the\nproduction arduous, largely due to Fox's strict release schedule. The studio\nbudgeted the film at $100 million, meaning Broyles' ambitious script had to be\nrewritten to reduce costs; [Lawrence Konner](/wiki/Lawrence_Konner \"Lawrence\nKonner\") and [Mark Rosenthal](/wiki/Mark_Rosenthal \"Mark Rosenthal\") worked on\nrewrites even as the film entered production. The tight schedule meant all\nstages of production were rushed.[68]\n\nThe film stars [Mark Wahlberg](/wiki/Mark_Wahlberg \"Mark Wahlberg\") as\nastronaut [Leo Davidson](/wiki/Leo_Davidson \"Leo Davidson\"), who accidentally\ntravels through a wormhole to a distant planet where talking apes enslave\nhumans.

The film received mixed\nreviews, with critics generally believing it failed to compare to the\noriginal. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and twist ending,\nthough many reviewers praised the special effects.[69][70] The film succeeded\nin the box office, taking in a total of $362,211,740.[71] Fox had initially\nhoped for a second film, but the difficult production made Burton disinclined\nto participate, and the film failed to generate enough interest for Fox to\npursue a sequel.[68]\n\n## Reboot film\nseries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Reboot film series\")]\n\n### _Rise of the Planet of the Apes_\n(2011)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Rise of the Planet of the Apes \\(2011\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Rise of the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Rise_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Andy_Serkis_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg/150px-\nAndy_Serkis_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Andy_Serkis_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Andy_Serkis_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Andy Serkis](/wiki/Andy_Serkis \"Andy Serkis\") portrayed Caesar via\n[performance capture acting](/wiki/Performance_capture_acting \"Performance\ncapture acting\")\n\nIn 2005, screenwriters [Rick Jaffa and Amanda\nSilver](/wiki/Rick_Jaffa_and_Amanda_Silver \"Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver\")\ndeveloped a concept for a new _Planet of the Apes_ film, eventually titled\n_[Rise of the Planet of the Apes](/wiki/Rise_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Rise\nof the Planet of the Apes\")_. Inspired by news articles on apes raised as\nhumans and advances in genetics, Jaffa conceived an idea for a film about a\ngenetically enhanced chimp raised in a human household. He and Silver pitched\nthe concept to Fox as a way to [reboot](/wiki/Reboot_\\(fiction\\) \"Reboot\n\\(fiction\\)\") the _Apes_ franchise by reinventing the story of the chimpanzee\n[Caesar](/wiki/Caesar_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Caesar \\(Planet of the Apes\\)\"),\nthe lead character of _Conquest_. Fox was impressed and bought the pitch, but\ndevelopment struggled for five years as the production cycled through scripts,\nwriters, directors, and producers. In 2010, producers [Peter\nChernin](/wiki/Peter_Chernin \"Peter Chernin\") and Dylan Clark of Chernin\nEntertainment stepped in to move the film forward, retaining Jaffa and Silver\nas writers.[72][73]\n\nIn the final script, Caesar receives enhanced cognition from a viral drug\ncreated by Will Rodman, who raises him. After being imprisoned in a primate\nsanctuary, Caesar uses his ingenuity to launch an uprising.[74] The screenplay\ncontains numerous complex connections to other entries in the series, causing\nsome confusion as to its exact relation to them. Oliver Lindler writes that\nwhile the film's premise might identify it as a [remake](/wiki/Remake\n\"Remake\") of _Conquest_ , official dispatches and professional reviewers\ntypically avoided the term, instead calling the film a [prequel](/wiki/Prequel\n\"Prequel\") or \"origin story\" to the original _Planet of the Apes_ film, and/or\na [reboot](/wiki/Reboot_\\(fiction\\) \"Reboot \\(fiction\\)\") of the series,\nalthough fans and bloggers were more apt to make the \"remake\"\nconnection.[75][76][77] The completed script attracted director [Rupert\nWyatt](/wiki/Rupert_Wyatt \"Rupert Wyatt\"). To portray ape characters\nrealistically, the production avoided [practical\neffects](/wiki/Practical_effects \"Practical effects\") and animal actors in\nfavor of [performance capture acting](/wiki/Performance_capture_acting\n\"Performance capture acting\"), partnering with New Zealand visual effects\ncompany [Weta Digital](/wiki/Weta_Digital \"Weta Digital\").

The black-\nand-white series featured comics adaptations of each of the films, new _Apes_\nstories by [Doug Moench](/wiki/Doug_Moench \"Doug Moench\"), series news,\nessays, interviews and other material. It became one of Marvel's most\nsuccessful titles, attracting 300 to 400 fan letters with every issue, so many\nthat the studio had to suspend its practice of writing personal responses.\nMarvel also published the monthly title _Adventures on the Planet of the Apes_\nfrom 1975 to 1976, comprising color reprints of the _Planet_ and _Beneath_\nadaptations.[103]\n\nIn 1990, during a resurgence of interest in the series, [Malibu\nComics](/wiki/Malibu_Comics \"Malibu Comics\") launched a new monthly black-and-\nwhite _Planet of the Apes_ comic through its Adventure Comics studio. The\ndebut issue sold 40,000, a record for black-and-white comics, leading to a\nsuccessful run of 24 issues over two years.

During the 1970s, Fox licensed around 60 companies to\nproduce about 300 different _Apes_ products, including action figures and\nplaysets, [model building](/wiki/Model_building \"Model building\") kits,\ncoloring books, [book-and-record sets](/wiki/Book-and-record_set \"Book-and-\nrecord set\"), trading cards, [toy weapons](/wiki/Toy_weapon \"Toy weapon\"),\ncostumes, apparel, branded tableware, and lunch boxes. This level of\nmerchandising was unusual for the time, and the success of _Apes_ merchandise\nmay have inspired the campaigns that later became commonplace for films and\ntelevision series.[106] The action figures, sold by\n[Mego](/wiki/Mego_Corporation \"Mego Corporation\") beginning in 1973, were the\nfirst such toys sold as film tie-ins; they proved popular and inspired the\nrise of action figure series based on popular culture franchises.[107] Eric\nGreene writes that _Apes_ toys were popular enough to lead some contemporary\nchildren to engage in apes-vs.-humans role-playing [make\nbelieve](/wiki/Make_believe \"Make believe\") games that simulated the series'\nconflicts in a manner similar to \"Cowboys and Indians\".[106] With the release\nof the 21st-century films, Fox licensed several companies to manufacture new\n_Apes_ toys, including detailed action figures of new and \"classic\" characters\nsold as [collectibles](/wiki/Collectible \"Collectible\").[108]\n\n### Theme park\nride[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit\nsection: Theme park ride\")]\n\nA _Planet of the Apes_ ride is planned for the [20th Century Fox\nWorld](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox_World \"20th Century Fox World\") [theme\npark](/wiki/Theme_park \"Theme park\") under construction in\n[Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia \"Malaysia\").[109]\n\n### Video\ngames[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Video games\")]\n\nIn 1983, 20th Century Fox Videogames developed a _Planet of the Apes_ game for\nthe [Atari 2600](/wiki/Atari_2600 \"Atari 2600\"), which was to be the first\ncomputer game based on the series. However, the game was still in the\n[prototype](/wiki/Prototype \"Prototype\") phase when Fox shuttered its game\ndivision during the [video game crash of 1983](/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983\n\"Video game crash of 1983\"), and never saw release. It was assumed lost until\n2002, when collectors identified a prototype, found earlier in a case labeled\n_Alligator People_ , as the missing _Apes_ game.[110][111] Independent\ndesigners Retrodesign completed and released the game as _[Revenge of the\nApes](/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Apes \"Revenge of the Apes\")_ in 2003.[111] In the\ngame, the player controls Taylor as he fights apes across several levels\ninspired by the film to reach the Statue of Liberty.[110]\n\nA video game based on the series did not appear until 2001. [Fox\nInteractive](/wiki/Fox_Interactive \"Fox Interactive\") began developing the\n[_Planet of the Apes_ game](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(video_game\\) \"Planet of\nthe Apes \\(video game\\)\") in 1998 for [PC](/wiki/PC_game \"PC game\") and\n[PlayStation](/wiki/PlayStation_\\(console\\) \"PlayStation \\(console\\)\") as a\ntie-in to the long-gestating [remake\nfilm](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(2001_film\\) \"Planet of the Apes \\(2001\nfilm\\)\"). Fox and [developer](/wiki/Video_game_developer \"Video game\ndeveloper\") [Visiware](/wiki/Visiware \"Visiware\") proceeded with the game when\nthe film went into limbo, creating their own story based on Boulle's novel and\nthe original films.[112][113] The game is an [action-adventure](/wiki/Action-\nadventure_video_game \"Action-adventure video game\") in which players control\nastronaut Ulysses as he explores an ape-ruled future Earth. Setbacks with the\nfilm project and Fox Interactive's decision to co-publish with another company\n([Ubisoft](/wiki/Ubisoft \"Ubisoft\")) delayed the game three years. Despite its\nlong development, the game missed the debut of Tim Burton's _Planet of the\nApes_ film by two months;[114] it finally appeared on September 20, 2001, to\nmostly negative reviews.[115][116][117] Additionally, Ubisoft produced a\nsubstantially different _Planet of the Apes_ game for [Game Boy\nAdvance](/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance \"Game Boy Advance\") and [Game Boy\nColor](/wiki/Game_Boy_Color \"Game Boy Color\"), a [side-scroller](/wiki/Side-\nscroller \"Side-scroller\") following the first two films.[113][118]\n\nIn 2014, Fox partnered with [Ndemic Creations](/wiki/Ndemic_Creations \"Ndemic\nCreations\") on a substantial _[Dawn of the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\")_\n-themed update to the [mobile game](/wiki/Mobile_game \"Mobile game\") _[Plague\nInc.](/wiki/Plague_Inc. \"Plague Inc.\")_ Players create and spread a \"Simian\nFlu\" virus to eradicate humans while helping apes survive.[119]\n\n[Andy Serkis](/wiki/Andy_Serkis \"Andy Serkis\") has mentioned that _[War for\nthe Planet of the Apes](/wiki/War_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"War for the\nPlanet of the Apes\")_ would be accompanied by a video game, for which he\nperformed motion capture.[120] Titled _[Planet of the Apes: Last\nFrontier](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes:_Last_Frontier \"Planet of the Apes: Last\nFrontier\")_ , the game is set for release for the [PlayStation\n4](/wiki/PlayStation_4 \"PlayStation 4\"), [Xbox One](/wiki/Xbox_One \"Xbox One\")\nand [PC](/wiki/Personal_computer \"Personal computer\") in fall 2017.[121]\n\n## Themes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Themes\")]\n\nCritics consider [race](/wiki/Race_\\(human_categorization\\) \"Race \\(human\ncategorization\\)\") to be the _Planet of the Apes_ series' primary theme.[6]\nEric Greene, author of a book on the role of race in the original films and\nspinoff material, writes that \"when seen as one epic work, the _Apes_ saga\nemerges as a liberal allegory of racial conflict.\"[35] In Greene's\ninterpretation, the franchise's plot arc is founded in the conflict between\nhumans and apes, who alternately subjugate one another in a destructive\ncycle.[122] [Difference](/wiki/Difference_\\(philosophy\\) \"Difference\n\\(philosophy\\)\") between human and ape manifests primarily in physical\nappearance, and dominance derives from social power rather than innate\nsuperiority. Each film shifts the power balance so that the audience\nidentifies sometimes with the humans, and other times with the apes.[123]\nAccording to Greene, this arc's central message is that unresolved racial\ndiscord inevitably leads to cataclysm.[122] Other critics have followed\nGreene's interpretations.[124][125] Producers Abrahams and Jacobs did not\nconsciously intend the first film's racial undertones, and did not appreciate\nthem until [Sammy Davis Jr.](/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr. \"Sammy Davis Jr.\") pointed\nthem out in 1968.[126][127][128] Subsequently, the filmmakers incorporated the\ntheme more overtly in later installments; as a result, race moves from being a\nsecondary theme in the first two films, to becoming the major concern of the\nlast three.[129]\n\nSeveral critics have written that the reboot films downplay the original\nseries' theme of race, generally arguing that this is to their\ndetriment.[130][131][132] Others, however, write that the films incorporate\nracial themes in subtler ways.[133]\n\nThe [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\") and the threat of [nuclear\nholocaust](/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust \"Nuclear holocaust\") are major themes\nintroduced in Rod Serling's original _Planet of the Apes_ script.[7] The films\nare [apocalyptic](/wiki/Apocalyptic_fiction \"Apocalyptic fiction\") and\n[dystopian](/wiki/Dystopian \"Dystopian\"), and portray the era's tensions\nleading to world destruction.[134][135] The films critique both sides of the\nwar, with the oppressive ape society and the mutant city featuring traits of\nboth Western culture and the Soviet bloc.[134][136] According to Greene, Cold\nWar themes were central to the first two films and some spinoff media, but\nwere less significant in the later sequels, which foregrounded racial conflict\ninstead.[137]\n\nQuestions of [animal rights](/wiki/Animal_rights \"Animal rights\") also figure\nheavily in the series; Greene considers this related to the racial\nthemes.[138] The first film portrays Taylor treated cruelly by apes who\nconsider him an animal; in later films humans abuse apes for the same\nreason.[139] The primate rights theme is much more dominant in the reboot\nfilms, which directly invoke the question of [great ape\npersonhood](/wiki/Great_ape_personhood \"Great ape personhood\") in portraying\nCaesar and his friends struggling for their rights in a society that does not\nconsider them [legal persons](/wiki/Legal_persons \"Legal persons\").[140]\n\n## Cultural impact and\nlegacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Cultural impact and legacy\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/WonderCon_2011_-_Planet_of_the_Apes_costumes_%28Dr_Zaius_and_Dr_Zira%29_%285593337505%29.jpg/200px-\nWonderCon_2011_-_Planet_of_the_Apes_costumes_%28Dr_Zaius_and_Dr_Zira%29_%285593337505%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:WonderCon_2011_-_Planet_of_the_Apes_costumes_\\(Dr_Zaius_and_Dr_Zira\\)_\\(5593337505\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:WonderCon_2011_-_Planet_of_the_Apes_costumes_\\(Dr_Zaius_and_Dr_Zira\\)_\\(5593337505\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nFans in costume as Dr. Zaius and Dr. Zira at a science fiction convention\n\n_Planet of the Apes_ received popular and critical attention well after\nproduction ended on the original films and television series.[17] Fans'\ninterest in the franchise continued through publications like [Marvel\nComics](/wiki/Marvel_Comics \"Marvel Comics\")' _[Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(comics\\) \"Planet of the Apes \\(comics\\)\")_\nmagazine[103] and [science fiction\nconventions](/wiki/Science_fiction_convention \"Science fiction convention\"),\nwhere the series was sufficiently popular to inspire \"apecons\"—conventions\ndevoted entirely to films involving apes—in the 1970s.[141] The series'\ndistinctive ape costumes were employed in live appearances, including by\nmusician [Paul Williams](/wiki/Paul_Williams_\\(songwriter\\) \"Paul Williams\n\\(songwriter\\)\") ([Virgil](/wiki/Virgil_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Virgil\n\\(Planet of the Apes\\)\") from _Battle_) on _[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny\nCarson](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson \"The Tonight Show\nStarring Johnny Carson\")_ and by [Mike Douglas](/wiki/Mike_Douglas \"Mike\nDouglas\") on _[The Mike Douglas Show](/wiki/The_Mike_Douglas_Show \"The Mike\nDouglas Show\")_.[17] In the 1970s, fans Bill Blake and Paula Crist created\nCornelius and Zira costumes; their routine was convincing enough that Fox\nlicensed them to portray the characters at events.[142] The films earned\nstrong ratings when they aired on television after their releases, and various\nstations rebroadcast them together in [marathons](/wiki/Marathon_\\(media\\)\n\"Marathon \\(media\\)\") in later years.[143] The live-action television series\nwas re-formatted into five TV movies for further broadcast in 1981,[55] and\nthe [Sci-Fi Channel](/wiki/Sci-Fi_Channel \"Sci-Fi Channel\") ran both it and\nthe cartoon in the 1990s.[100]\n\n_Planet of the Apes_ had a wide impact on subsequent popular media. In terms\nof production, the series' success with sequelization, spinoffs, and\nmerchandising established a new model of [media\nfranchising](/wiki/Media_franchising \"Media franchising\") in Hollywood\nfilmmaking, in which studios develop films specifically to generate multi-\nmedia franchises.[144] In terms of content, the series influenced various\nfilms and television productions during the 1970s and '80s that used science\nfiction settings and characters to explore race relations, including _[Alien\nNation](/wiki/Alien_Nation \"Alien Nation\")_ , _[Enemy\nMine](/wiki/Enemy_Mine_\\(film\\) \"Enemy Mine \\(film\\)\")_ , and\n_[V](/wiki/V_\\(science_fiction\\) \"V \\(science fiction\\)\")_. More direct\ninfluence can be seen in [DC Comics](/wiki/DC_Comics \"DC Comics\")' 1972–1978\nseries _[Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth](/wiki/Kamandi:_The_Last_Boy_on_Earth\n\"Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth\")_ and the Japanese franchise _[Time of the\nApes](/wiki/Time_of_the_Apes \"Time of the Apes\")_ , which concern human\nprotagonists in post-apocalyptic worlds ruled by talking animals.[55] [Mel\nBrooks](/wiki/Mel_Brooks \"Mel Brooks\")' 1987 science fiction spoof\n_[Spaceballs](/wiki/Spaceballs \"Spaceballs\")_ lampooned the Statue of Liberty\nending from the original _Planet_.[145]\n\nInterest in the series resurged in the 1990s, as plans for a new film and\nother media circulated. Greene attributes this renewed interest to a\ncombination of \"pop culture nostalgia and baby boomer economics\", as well as a\n\"political ferment\" rising at the time that hearkened back to the period when\nthe films were first released.[146] Inspired particularly by the publication\nof the [Malibu Comics](/wiki/Malibu_Comics \"Malibu Comics\") series, during\nthis period fans founded new clubs, websites, and [fanzines](/wiki/Fanzine\n\"Fanzine\") active in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and other countries.[147]\nCompanies began producing new branded merchandise, including clothing, toys,\nand costumes.[148]\n\nEspecially after the 1990s, artists in diverse media referenced, incorporated,\nor were otherwise influenced by the series. _Planet of the Apes_ turned up in\nsongs by various musicians, references in films, comedy bits by [Dennis\nMiller](/wiki/Dennis_Miller \"Dennis Miller\") and [Paul\nMooney](/wiki/Paul_Mooney_\\(comedian\\) \"Paul Mooney \\(comedian\\)\"), and an\nepisode of _[Saturday Night Live](/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live \"Saturday Night\nLive\")_ hosted by Charlton Heston. _[The Simpsons](/wiki/The_Simpsons \"The\nSimpsons\")_ parodied the series several times.[145] Notably, the episode \"[A\nFish Called Selma](/wiki/A_Fish_Called_Selma \"A Fish Called Selma\")\" features\nthe washed-up actor [Troy McClure](/wiki/Troy_McClure \"Troy McClure\") starring\nin a [Broadway musical](/wiki/Broadway_musical \"Broadway musical\") adaptation\ncalled _Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!_[149] Artist [Martha\nRosler](/wiki/Martha_Rosler \"Martha Rosler\") incorporated footage of Cornelius\nand Zira's interrogation from _Escape_ in her\n[installation](/wiki/Installation_art \"Installation art\") \"Global Taste: A\nMeal in Three Courses\", while [Guillermo Gómez-\nPeña](/wiki/Guillermo_G%C3%B3mez-Pe%C3%B1a \"Guillermo Gómez-Peña\") and [Coco\nFusco](/wiki/Coco_Fusco \"Coco Fusco\") employed video from _Planet_ in a 1993\n[performance art](/wiki/Performance_art \"Performance art\") piece at the\n[Whitney Museum of American Art](/wiki/Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art \"Whitney\nMuseum of American Art\").[150]\n\nThe series' impact has also extended to the political sphere, and groups of\nvarious leanings have employed its themes and imagery in their discourse.[151]\nThe phrase \"planet of the apes\" has been used for an overturning of the\npolitical or racial _status quo_.[152] Eric Greene writes that it is\nespecially popular among [racial nationalists](/wiki/Racial_nationalism\n\"Racial nationalism\") and reactionaries of different stripes, who use it in\nreference to race conflict.[153] According to Greene, [white\nsupremacists](/wiki/White_supremacist \"White supremacist\") liken minority\nadvancement to the films' world in which supposed \"inferiors\" seize control,\nwhile [black nationalists](/wiki/Black_nationalists \"Black nationalists\")\nsubvert the reference to celebrate the \"racial apocalypse\"; in this spirit,\n[gangsta rap](/wiki/Gangsta_rap \"Gangsta rap\") group [Da Lench\nMob](/wiki/Da_Lench_Mob \"Da Lench Mob\") titled their 1994 album _[Planet of da\nApes](/wiki/Planet_of_da_Apes \"Planet of da Apes\")_. Greene writes that these\nuses invert the anti-racist message of the films.[154] _Planet_ 's final image\nof the ruined Statue of Liberty has become a common political reference; for\nexample, [Greenpeace](/wiki/Greenpeace \"Greenpeace\") used it in an advertising\ncampaign against [nuclear testing](/wiki/Nuclear_testing \"Nuclear testing\").\nThe series' themes and imagery have been invoked in political discussions on\ntopics as varied as [Sixties](/wiki/Sixties \"Sixties\") culture, urban decay,\ncontemporary wars, and gun violence.[155]\n\n## List of\nmedia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: List of media\")]\n\n### Feature\nfilms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Feature films\")]\n\nNumber | Title | Release date | Director | Continuity  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | _[Planet of the Apes](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(1968_film\\) \"Planet of the Apes \\(1968 film\\)\")_ | 000000001968-02-08-0000February 8, 1968 | [Franklin J.
