[isolated\nsystem](/wiki/Isolated_system \"Isolated system\") can never decrease over time.\nThe total entropy can remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in a\nsteady state ([equilibrium](/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium \"Thermodynamic\nequilibrium\")), or is undergoing a [reversible\nprocess](/wiki/Reversible_process_\\(thermodynamics\\) \"Reversible process\n\\(thermodynamics\\)\"). In all spontaneous processes,[1] the total entropy\nalways increases and the process is [irreversible](/wiki/Irreversible_process\n\"Irreversible process\"). The increase in entropy accounts for the\nirreversibility of natural processes, and the [asymmetry between future and\npast](/wiki/Arrow_of_time \"Arrow of time\").[2]\n\nHistorically, the second law was an [empirical\nfinding](/wiki/Empirical_evidence \"Empirical evidence\") that was accepted as\nan axiom of [thermodynamic theory](/wiki/Thermodynamics \"Thermodynamics\").\n[Statistical mechanics](/wiki/Statistical_mechanics \"Statistical mechanics\"),\nclassical or [quantum](/wiki/Quantum_thermodynamics \"Quantum thermodynamics\"),\nexplains the microscopic origin of the law.\n\nThe second law has been expressed in many ways. Its first formulation is\ncredited to the French scientist [Sadi\nCarnot](/wiki/Nicolas_L%C3%A9onard_Sadi_Carnot \"Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot\"),\nwho in 1824 showed that there is an upper limit to the efficiency of\nconversion of heat to work, in a heat engine.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Introduction\n  * 2 Various statements of the law\n    * 2.1 Carnot's principle\n    * 2.2 Clausius statement\n    * 2.3 Kelvin statement\n    * 2.4 Equivalence of the Clausius and the Kelvin statements\n    * 2.5 Planck's proposition\n    * 2.6 Relation between Kelvin's statement and Planck's proposition\n    * 2.7 Planck's statement\n    * 2.8 Principle of Carathéodory\n    * 2.9 Planck's principle\n    * 2.10 Statement for a system that has a known expression of its internal energy as a function of its extensive state variables\n  * 3 Corollaries\n    * 3.1 Perpetual motion of the second kind\n    * 3.2 Carnot theorem\n    * 3.3 Clausius Inequality\n    * 3.4 Thermodynamic temperature\n    * 3.5 Entropy\n    * 3.6 Energy, available useful work\n  * 4 History\n    * 4.1 Account given by Clausius\n  * 5 Statistical mechanics\n  * 6 Derivation from statistical mechanics\n    * 6.1 Derivation of the entropy change for reversible processes\n    * 6.2 Derivation for systems described by the canonical ensemble\n  * 7 Living organisms\n  * 8 Gravitational systems\n  * 9 Non-equilibrium states\n  * 10 Arrow of time\n  * 11 Irreversibility\n    * 11.1 Loschmidt's paradox\n    * 11.2 Poincaré recurrence theorem\n    * 11.3 Maxwell's demon\n  * 12 Quotations\n  * 13 See also\n  * 14 References\n    * 14.1 Bibliography of citations\n  * 15 Further reading\n  * 16 External links\n\n##\nIntroduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Introduction\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Heat_flow_hot_to_cold.png/220px-\nHeat_flow_hot_to_cold.png)](/wiki/File:Heat_flow_hot_to_cold.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Heat_flow_hot_to_cold.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nHeat flow from hot water to cold water.\n\nThe [first law of thermodynamics](/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics \"First law\nof thermodynamics\") provides the basic definition of [internal\nenergy](/wiki/Internal_energy \"Internal energy\"), associated with all\n[thermodynamic systems](/wiki/Thermodynamic_system \"Thermodynamic system\"),\nand states the rule of [conservation of energy](/wiki/Conservation_of_energy\n\"Conservation of energy\").[3][4] The second law is concerned with the\ndirection of natural processes.[5] It asserts that a natural process runs only\nin one sense, and is not reversible. For example, heat always flows\nspontaneously from hotter to colder bodies, and never the reverse, unless\nexternal work is performed on the system. The explanation of the phenomena was\ngiven in terms of [entropy](/wiki/Entropy \"Entropy\").[6][7] Total entropy (S)\ncan never decrease over time for an isolated system because the entropy of an\nisolated system spontaneously evolves toward thermodynamic equilibrium: the\nentropy should stay the same or increase.\n\nIn a fictive reversible process, an infinitesimal increment in the entropy (d\n_S_) of a system is defined to result from an infinitesimal transfer of heat\n(δ _Q_) to a [closed system](/wiki/Closed_system \"Closed system\") (which\nallows the entry or exit of energy - but not matter) divided by the common\ntemperature (_T_) of the system and the surroundings which supply the heat:[8]\n\n     d S = δ Q T (closed system, idealized fictive reversible process) . {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} S={\\frac {\\delta Q}{T}}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,{\\text{(closed system, idealized fictive reversible process)}}.} ![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathrm {d} S={\\\\frac {\\\\delta Q}{T}}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,{\\\\text{\\(closed system, idealized fictive reversible process\\)}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/510bc43ac85e8dc0c7bec89d0c37f7c1bad0f702)\n\nDifferent notations are used for infinitesimal amounts of heat (δ) and\ninfinitesimal amounts of entropy (d) because entropy is a [function of\nstate](/wiki/Function_of_state \"Function of state\"), while heat, like work, is\nnot. For an actually possible infinitesimal process without exchange of matter\nwith the surroundings, the second law requires that the increment in system\nentropy be greater than that:\n\n     d S > δ Q T (closed system, actually possible, irreversible process). {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} S>{\\frac {\\delta Q}{T}}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,{\\text{(closed system, actually possible, irreversible process).}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathrm {d} S>{\\\\frac {\\\\delta Q}{T}}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,{\\\\text{\\(closed system, actually possible, irreversible process\\).}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65666afe0808c2c6b45b475b3f3b078d403377e1)\n\nThis is because a general process for this case may include work being done on\nthe system by its surroundings, which must have frictional or viscous effects\ninside the system, and because heat transfer actually occurs only\nirreversibly, driven by a finite temperature difference.[9][10] Indroducing a\nset of internal variables  ξ {\\displaystyle \\xi } ![\\\\xi\n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e0b461aaf61091abd5d2c808931c48b8ff9647db)\nto describe the deviation of a thermodynamic system from the equilibrium\nstate, one can record the equality\n\n     d S = δ Q T − 1 T ∑ j Ξ j δ ξ j (closed system, actually possible, irreversible process). {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} S={\\frac {\\delta Q}{T}}-{\\frac {1}{T}}\\sum _{j}\\,\\Xi _{j}\\,\\delta \\xi _{j}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,{\\text{(closed system, actually possible, irreversible process).}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathrm {d} S={\\\\frac {\\\\delta Q}{T}}-{\\\\frac {1}{T}}\\\\sum _{j}\\\\,\\\\Xi _{j}\\\\,\\\\delta \\\\xi _{j}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,{\\\\text{\\(closed system, actually possible, irreversible process\\).}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cb7efbedf95142337f06603089505b583367f77e)\n\nThe second term represents work of internal variables that can be perturbed by\nexternal influences, but the system cannot perform any positive work via\ninternal variables. This statement introduces the impossibility of the\nreversion of evolution of the thermodynamic system in time and can be\nconsidered as a formulation of _the second principle of thermodynamics_ \\--\nthe formulation, which is, of course, equivalent to the formulation of the\nprinciple in terms of entropy[11][12].\n\n  \nThe [zeroth law of thermodynamics](/wiki/Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics \"Zeroth\nlaw of thermodynamics\") in its usual short statement allows recognition that\ntwo bodies in a relation of thermal equilibrium have the same temperature,\nespecially that a test body has the same temperature as a reference\nthermometric body.[13] For a body in thermal equilibrium with another, there\nare indefinitely many empirical temperature scales, in general respectively\ndepending on the properties of a particular reference thermometric body. The\nsecond law allows a distinguished temperature scale, which defines an\nabsolute, [thermodynamic temperature](/wiki/Thermodynamic_temperature\n\"Thermodynamic temperature\"), independent of the properties of any particular\nreference thermometric body.[14][15]\n\n## Various statements of the\nlaw[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Various statements of the law\")]\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics may be expressed in many specific ways,[16]\nthe most prominent classical statements[17] being the statement by [Rudolf\nClausius](/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius \"Rudolf Clausius\") (1854), the statement by\n[Lord Kelvin](/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin \"William Thomson, 1st\nBaron Kelvin\") (1851), and the statement in axiomatic thermodynamics by\n[Constantin Carathéodory](/wiki/Constantin_Carath%C3%A9odory \"Constantin\nCarathéodory\") (1909).

It refers to a cycle of a [Carnot heat\nengine](/wiki/Carnot_heat_engine \"Carnot heat engine\"), fictively operated in\nthe limiting mode of extreme slowness known as quasi-static, so that the heat\nand work transfers are between subsystems that are always in their own\ninternal states of thermodynamic equilibrium. The Carnot engine is an\nidealized device of special interest to engineers who are concerned with the\nefficiency of heat engines. Carnot's principle was recognized by Carnot at a\ntime when the [caloric theory](/wiki/Caloric_theory \"Caloric theory\") of heat\nwas seriously considered, before the recognition of the [first law of\nthermodynamics](/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics \"First law of\nthermodynamics\"), and before the mathematical expression of the concept of\nentropy. Interpreted in the light of the first law, it is physically\nequivalent to the second law of thermodynamics, and remains valid today. It\nstates\n\n> The efficiency of a quasi-static or reversible Carnot cycle depends only on\n> the temperatures of the two heat reservoirs, and is the same, whatever the\n> working substance. A Carnot engine operated in this way is the most\n> efficient possible heat engine using those two\n> temperatures.[19][20][21][22][23][24][25]\n\n### Clausius\nstatement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Clausius statement\")]\n\nThe German scientist [Rudolf Clausius](/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius \"Rudolf\nClausius\") laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics in 1850 by\nexamining the relation between heat transfer and work.[26] His formulation of\nthe second law, which was published in German in 1854, is known as the\n_Clausius statement_ :\n\n> Heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other\n> change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time.[27]\n\nThe statement by Clausius uses the concept of 'passage of heat'. As is usual\nin thermodynamic discussions, this means 'net transfer of energy as heat', and\ndoes not refer to contributory transfers one way and the other.\n\nHeat cannot spontaneously flow from cold regions to hot regions without\nexternal work being performed on the system, which is evident from ordinary\nexperience of refrigeration, for example. In a refrigerator, heat flows from\ncold to hot, but only when forced by an external agent, the refrigeration\nsystem.\n\n### Kelvin\nstatement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Kelvin statement\")]\n\n[Lord Kelvin](/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin \"William Thomson, 1st\nBaron Kelvin\") expressed the second law as\n\n    \n\n    It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.[28]\n\n### Equivalence of the Clausius and the Kelvin\nstatements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Equivalence of the Clausius and the Kelvin statements\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Deriving_Kelvin_Statement_from_Clausius_Statement.svg/300px-\nDeriving_Kelvin_Statement_from_Clausius_Statement.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Deriving_Kelvin_Statement_from_Clausius_Statement.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Deriving_Kelvin_Statement_from_Clausius_Statement.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDerive Kelvin Statement from Clausius Statement\n\nSuppose there is an engine violating the Kelvin statement: i.e., one that\ndrains heat and converts it completely into work in a cyclic fashion without\nany other result.

In the limit, i.e. for reversible processes, the sum of the entropies remains unchanged.[35][36][37]\n\nRather like Planck's statement is that of Uhlenbeck and Ford for _irreversible\nphenomena_.\n\n    \n\n    ... in an irreversible or spontaneous change from one equilibrium state to another (as for example the equalization of temperature of two bodies A and B, when brought in contact) the entropy always increases.[38]\n\n### Principle of\nCarathéodory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Principle of Carathéodory\")]\n\n[Constantin Carathéodory](/wiki/Constantin_Carath%C3%A9odory \"Constantin\nCarathéodory\") formulated thermodynamics on a purely mathematical axiomatic\nfoundation. His statement of the second law is known as the Principle of\nCarathéodory, which may be formulated as follows:[39]\n\n> In every neighborhood of any state S of an adiabatically enclosed system\n> there are states inaccessible from S.[40]\n\nWith this formulation, he described the concept of [adiabatic\naccessibility](/wiki/Adiabatic_accessibility \"Adiabatic accessibility\") for\nthe first time and provided the foundation for a new subfield of classical\nthermodynamics, often called [geometrical\nthermodynamics](/wiki/Ruppeiner_geometry \"Ruppeiner geometry\"). It follows\nfrom Carathéodory's principle that quantity of energy quasi-statically\ntransferred as heat is a holonomic [process function](/wiki/Process_function\n\"Process function\"), in other words,  δ Q = T d S {\\displaystyle \\delta Q=TdS}\n![\\\\delta\nQ=TdS](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e8142742fd8644554e5a89912f03dcac94097b70).[41]\n[_[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please\nclarify\")_]\n\nThough it is almost customary in textbooks to say that Carathéodory's\nprinciple expresses the second law and to treat it as equivalent to the\nClausius or to the Kelvin-Planck statements, such is not the case. To get all\nthe content of the second law, Carathéodory's principle needs to be\nsupplemented by Planck's principle, that isochoric work always increases the\ninternal energy of a closed system that was initially in its own internal\nthermodynamic equilibrium.[10][42][43][44] [_[clarification\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_]\n\n### Planck's\nprinciple[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Planck's principle\")]\n\nIn 1926, [Max Planck](/wiki/Max_Planck \"Max Planck\") wrote an important paper\non the basics of thermodynamics.[43][45] He indicated the principle\n\n    \n\n    The internal energy of a closed system is increased by an adiabatic process, throughout the duration of which, the volume of the system remains constant.[10][42]\n\nThis formulation does not mention heat and does not mention temperature, nor\neven entropy, and does not necessarily implicitly rely on those concepts, but\nit implies the content of the second law. A closely related statement is that\n\"Frictional pressure never does positive work.\"[46] Using a now-obsolete form\nof words, Planck himself wrote: \"The production of heat by friction is\nirreversible.\"[47][48]\n\nNot mentioning entropy, this principle of Planck is stated in physical terms.\nIt is very closely related to the Kelvin statement given just above.[49] It is\nrelevant that for a system at constant volume and [mole\nnumbers](/wiki/Mole_\\(unit\\) \"Mole \\(unit\\)\"), the entropy is a monotonic\nfunction of the internal energy. Nevertheless, this principle of Planck is not\nactually Planck's preferred statement of the second law, which is quoted\nabove, in a previous sub-section of the present section of this present\narticle, and relies on the concept of entropy.\n\nA statement that in a sense is complementary to Planck's principle is made by\nBorgnakke and Sonntag. They do not offer it as a full statement of the second\nlaw:\n\n    \n\n    ... there is only one way in which the entropy of a [closed] system can be decreased, and that is to transfer heat from the system.[50]\n\nDiffering from Planck's just foregoing principle, this one is explicitly in\nterms of entropy change.

Carnot, however, further postulated that some\ncaloric is lost, not being converted to mechanical work. Hence, no real heat\nengine could realise the [Carnot cycle](/wiki/Carnot_cycle \"Carnot cycle\")'s\nreversibility and was condemned to be less efficient.\n\nThough formulated in terms of caloric (see the obsolete [caloric\ntheory](/wiki/Caloric_theory \"Caloric theory\")), rather than\n[entropy](/wiki/Entropy \"Entropy\"), this was an early insight into the second\nlaw.\n\n### Clausius\nInequality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Clausius Inequality\")]\n\nThe [Clausius theorem](/wiki/Clausius_theorem \"Clausius theorem\") (1854)\nstates that in a cyclic process\n\n     ∮ ⁡ δ Q T ≤ 0. {\\displaystyle \\oint {\\frac {\\delta Q}{T}}\\leq 0.} ![\\\\oint \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} \\\\leq 0.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/92fd57e672b40d9b91789ba0c91659d96977079d)\n\nThe equality holds in the reversible case[53] and the '<' is in the\nirreversible case.

and then the Second Law\ninequality from above.\n\nIt therefore follows that any net work _δw_ done by the sub-system must obey\n\n     δ w ≤ − d U + T R d S + ∑ μ i R d N i {\\displaystyle \\delta w\\leq -dU+T_{R}dS+\\sum \\mu _{iR}dN_{i}\\,} ![ \\\\delta w \\\\le - dU + T_R dS + \\\\sum \\\\mu_{iR} dN_i \\\\,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b03468149232bee1360651feb7e9c99c136b887)\n\nIt is useful to separate the work _δw_ done by the subsystem into the _useful_\nwork _δw u_ that can be done _by_ the sub-system, over and beyond the work _p\nR dV_ done merely by the sub-system expanding against the surrounding external\npressure, giving the following relation for the useful work (exergy) that can\nbe done:\n\n     δ w u ≤ − d ( U − T R S + p R V − ∑ μ i R N i ) {\\displaystyle \\delta w_{u}\\leq -d(U-T_{R}S+p_{R}V-\\sum \\mu _{iR}N_{i})\\,} ![ \\\\delta w_u \\\\le -d \\(U - T_R S + p_R V - \\\\sum \\\\mu_{iR} N_i \\)\\\\,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba17b907afccd6db56158ec2bf0f1e7f4422c57a)\n\nIt is convenient to define the right-hand-side as the exact derivative of a\nthermodynamic potential, called the _availability_ or _[exergy](/wiki/Exergy\n\"Exergy\")_ _E_ of the subsystem,\n\n     E = U − T R S + p R V − ∑ μ i R N i {\\displaystyle E=U-T_{R}S+p_{R}V-\\sum \\mu _{iR}N_{i}} ![ E = U - T_R S + p_R V - \\\\sum \\\\mu_{iR} N_i ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d57f01079f3ca8f334a7f7d601a44572fd5cefa)\n\nThe Second Law therefore implies that for any process which can be considered\nas divided simply into a subsystem, and an unlimited temperature and pressure\nreservoir with which it is in contact,\n\n     d E + δ w u ≤ 0 {\\displaystyle dE+\\delta w_{u}\\leq 0\\,} ![ dE + \\\\delta w_u \\\\le 0 \\\\, ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3b3f49300a2d37beaee3edb615ddac4c676ebd4)\n\ni.e. the change in the subsystem's exergy plus the useful work done _by_ the\nsubsystem (or, the change in the subsystem's exergy less any work, additional\nto that done by the pressure reservoir, done _on_ the system) must be less\nthan or equal to zero.\n\nIn sum, if a proper _infinite-reservoir-like_ reference state is chosen as the\nsystem surroundings in the real world, then the Second Law predicts a decrease\nin _E_ for an irreversible process and no change for a reversible process.\n\n     d S t o t ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle dS_{tot}\\geq 0} ![dS_{tot} \\\\ge 0 ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eb3cf668753dda37014ccca27787a80a6e6f4c3c) Is equivalent to  d E + δ w u ≤ 0 {\\displaystyle dE+\\delta w_{u}\\leq 0} ![ dE + \\\\delta w_u \\\\le 0 ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/263c3052f2f3f8c38885c3c83a2d9188b932976a)\n\nThis expression together with the associated reference state permits a [design\nengineer](/wiki/Design_engineer \"Design engineer\") working at the macroscopic\nscale (above the [thermodynamic limit](/wiki/Thermodynamic_limit\n\"Thermodynamic limit\")) to utilize the Second Law without directly measuring\nor considering entropy change in a total isolated system. (_Also, see[process\nengineer](/wiki/Process_engineer \"Process engineer\")_). Those changes have\nalready been considered by the assumption that the system under consideration\ncan reach equilibrium with the reference state without altering the reference\nstate. An efficiency for a process or collection of processes that compares it\nto the reversible ideal may also be found (_See[second law\nefficiency](/wiki/Exergy_efficiency \"Exergy efficiency\")_.)\n\nThis approach to the Second Law is widely utilized in\n[engineering](/wiki/Engineering \"Engineering\") practice, [environmental\naccounting](/wiki/Environmental_accounting \"Environmental accounting\"),\n[systems ecology](/wiki/Systems_ecology \"Systems ecology\"), and other\ndisciplines.\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nSee also: [History of entropy](/wiki/History_of_entropy \"History of entropy\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Sadi_Carnot.jpeg/170px-\nSadi_Carnot.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Sadi_Carnot.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sadi_Carnot.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in the traditional uniform of a student of the\n[École Polytechnique](/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique \"École Polytechnique\").\n\nThe first theory of the conversion of heat into mechanical work is due to\n[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot](/wiki/Nicolas_L%C3%A9onard_Sadi_Carnot \"Nicolas\nLéonard Sadi Carnot\") in 1824. He was the first to realize correctly that the\nefficiency of this conversion depends on the difference of temperature between\nan engine and its environment.\n\nRecognizing the significance of [James Prescott\nJoule](/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule \"James Prescott Joule\")'s work on the\nconservation of energy, [Rudolf Clausius](/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius \"Rudolf\nClausius\") was the first to formulate the second law during 1850, in this\nform: heat does not flow _spontaneously_ from cold to hot bodies. While common\nknowledge now, this was contrary to the [caloric theory](/wiki/Caloric_theory\n\"Caloric theory\") of heat popular at the time, which considered heat as a\nfluid. From there he was able to infer the principle of Sadi Carnot and the\ndefinition of entropy (1865).\n\nEstablished during the 19th century, the [Kelvin-Planck statement of the\nSecond Law](/wiki/Kelvin-Planck_statement \"Kelvin-Planck statement\") says, \"It\nis impossible for any device that operates on a [cycle](/wiki/Cyclic_process\n\"Cyclic process\") to receive heat from a single\n[reservoir](/wiki/Heat_reservoir \"Heat reservoir\") and produce a net amount of\nwork.\" This was shown to be equivalent to the statement of Clausius.\n\nThe [ergodic hypothesis](/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis \"Ergodic hypothesis\") is\nalso important for the [Boltzmann](/wiki/Boltzmann \"Boltzmann\") approach. It\nsays that, over long periods of time, the time spent in some region of the\nphase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume\nof this region, i.e. that all accessible microstates are equally probable over\na long period of time. Equivalently, it says that time average and average\nover the statistical ensemble are the same.\n\nThere is a traditional doctrine, starting with Clausius, that entropy can be\nunderstood in terms of molecular 'disorder' within a [macroscopic\nsystem](/wiki/Macroscopic_bodies \"Macroscopic bodies\"). This doctrine is\nobsolescent.[54][55][56]\n\n### Account given by\nClausius[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Account given by Clausius\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Clausius-1.jpg/170px-\nClausius-1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Clausius-1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Clausius-1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRudolf Clausius\n\nIn 1856, the German physicist [Rudolf Clausius](/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius \"Rudolf\nClausius\") stated what he called the \"second fundamental theorem in the\n[mechanical theory of heat](/wiki/Mechanical_theory_of_heat \"Mechanical theory\nof heat\")\" in the following form:[57]\n\n     ∫ δ Q T = − N {\\displaystyle \\int {\\frac {\\delta Q}{T}}=-N} ![\\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} = -N](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/788c11865876c1029258d9f6c21a942a0909650f)\n\nwhere _Q_ is heat, _T_ is temperature and _N_ is the \"equivalence-value\" of\nall uncompensated transformations involved in a cyclical process. Later, in\n1865, Clausius would come to define \"equivalence-value\" as entropy. On the\nheels of this definition, that same year, the most famous version of the\nsecond law was read in a presentation at the Philosophical Society of Zurich\non April 24, in which, in the end of his presentation, Clausius concludes:\n\n> The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.\n\nThis statement is the best-known phrasing of the second law. Because of the\nlooseness of its language, e.g. [universe](/wiki/Universe \"Universe\"), as well\nas lack of specific conditions, e.g. open, closed, or isolated, many people\ntake this simple statement to mean that the second law of thermodynamics\napplies virtually to every subject imaginable. This is not true; this\nstatement is only a simplified version of a more extended and precise\ndescription.\n\nIn terms of time variation, the mathematical statement of the second law for\nan [isolated system](/wiki/Isolated_system \"Isolated system\") undergoing an\narbitrary transformation is:\n\n     d S d t ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dS}{dt}}\\geq 0} ![\\\\frac{dS}{dt} \\\\ge 0](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c43dbbd79e66bed761e987211afc239aa28a4c21)\n\nwhere\n\n    _S_ is the entropy of the system and\n    _t_ is [time](/wiki/Time \"Time\").\n\nThe equality sign applies after equilibration. An alternative way of\nformulating of the second law for isolated systems is:\n\n     d S d t = S ˙ i {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dS}{dt}}={\\dot {S}}_{i}} ![\\\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\\\dot S_{i}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b59a70a9a30cf83f14b0420b7e492ecc1cada0e9) with  S ˙ i ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle {\\dot {S}}_{i}\\geq 0} ![ \\\\dot S_{i} \\\\ge 0](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/719993abd1d3ae44bff01c2c5928a4f5d6114ee5)\n\nwith  S ˙ i {\\displaystyle {\\dot {S}}_{i}} ![ \\\\dot\nS_{i}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fa1d3c8a530c24cf9f0aca888ef6600baa3b530b)\nthe sum of the rate of [entropy production](/wiki/Entropy_production \"Entropy\nproduction\") by all processes inside the system. The advantage of this\nformulation is that it shows the effect of the [entropy\nproduction](/wiki/Entropy_production \"Entropy production\").

A particular set\nof positions and velocities for each particle in the system is called a\n[microstate](/wiki/Microstate_\\(statistical_mechanics\\) \"Microstate\n\\(statistical mechanics\\)\") of the system and because of the constant motion,\nthe system is constantly changing its microstate. Statistical mechanics\npostulates that, in equilibrium, each microstate that the system might be in\nis equally likely to occur, and when this assumption is made, it leads\ndirectly to the conclusion that the second law must hold in a statistical\nsense. That is, the second law will hold on average, with a statistical\nvariation on the order of 1/√ _N_ where _N_ is the number of particles in the\nsystem. For everyday (macroscopic) situations, the probability that the second\nlaw will be violated is practically zero. However, for systems with a small\nnumber of particles, thermodynamic parameters, including the entropy, may show\nsignificant statistical deviations from that predicted by the second law.\nClassical thermodynamic theory does not deal with these statistical\nvariations.\n\n## Derivation from statistical\nmechanics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Derivation from statistical mechanics\")]\n\nFurther information: [H-theorem](/wiki/H-theorem \"H-theorem\")\n\nThe first mechanical argument of the [Kinetic theory of\ngases](/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases \"Kinetic theory of gases\") that molecular\ncollisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards\nequilibrium was due to [James Clerk Maxwell](/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell \"James\nClerk Maxwell\") in 1860;[58] [Ludwig Boltzmann](/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann \"Ludwig\nBoltzmann\") with his [H-theorem](/wiki/H-theorem \"H-theorem\") of 1872 also\nargued that due to collisions gases should over time tend toward the [Maxwell-\nBoltzmann distribution](/wiki/Maxwell-Boltzmann_distribution \"Maxwell-\nBoltzmann distribution\").\n\nDue to [Loschmidt's paradox](/wiki/Loschmidt%27s_paradox \"Loschmidt's\nparadox\"), derivations of the Second Law have to make an assumption regarding\nthe past, namely that the system is\n[uncorrelated](/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence \"Correlation and dependence\")\nat some time in the past; this allows for simple probabilistic treatment. This\nassumption is usually thought as a [boundary\ncondition](/wiki/Boundary_condition \"Boundary condition\"), and thus the second\nLaw is ultimately a consequence of the initial conditions somewhere in the\npast, probably at the beginning of the universe (the [Big Bang](/wiki/Big_Bang\n\"Big Bang\")), though [other scenarios](/wiki/Boltzmann_brain \"Boltzmann\nbrain\") have also been suggested.[59][60][61]\n\nGiven these assumptions, in statistical mechanics, the Second Law is not a\npostulate, rather it is a consequence of the [fundamental\npostulate](/wiki/Statistical_mechanics#Fundamental_postulate \"Statistical\nmechanics\"), also known as the equal prior probability postulate, so long as\none is clear that simple probability arguments are applied only to the future,\nwhile for the past there are auxiliary sources of information which tell us\nthat it was low entropy.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The first part of the second law, which states\nthat the entropy of a thermally isolated system can only increase, is a\ntrivial consequence of the equal prior probability postulate, if we restrict\nthe notion of the entropy to systems in thermal equilibrium.

These two ways help to\nunderstand the processes of life. This topic is mostly beyond the scope of\nthis present article, but has been considered by several authors, such as\n[Erwin Schrödinger](/wiki/What_is_Life%3F \"What is Life?\"), [Léon\nBrillouin](/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Brillouin \"Léon Brillouin\")[62] and [Isaac\nAsimov](/wiki/Life_and_Energy \"Life and Energy\"). It is also the topic of\ncurrent research.\n\nTo a fair approximation, living organisms may be considered as examples of\n(b). Approximately, an animal's physical state cycles by the day, leaving the\nanimal nearly unchanged. Animals take in food, water, and oxygen, and, as a\nresult of [metabolism](/wiki/Metabolism \"Metabolism\"), give out breakdown\nproducts and heat. Plants [take in radiative energy](/wiki/Photosynthesis\n\"Photosynthesis\") from the sun, which may be regarded as heat, and carbon\ndioxide and water. They give out oxygen. In this way they grow. Eventually\nthey die, and their remains rot. This can be regarded as a cyclic process.\nOverall, the sunlight is from a high temperature source, the sun, and its\nenergy is passed to a lower temperature sink, the soil. This is an increase of\nentropy of the surroundings of the plant. Thus animals and plants obey the\nsecond law of thermodynamics, considered in terms of cyclic processes. Simple\nconcepts of efficiency of heat engines are hardly applicable to this problem\nbecause they assume closed systems.\n\nFrom the thermodynamic viewpoint that considers (a), passages from one\nequilibrium state to another, only a roughly approximate picture appears,\nbecause living organisms are never in states of thermodynamic equilibrium.\nLiving organisms must often be considered as open systems, because they take\nin nutrients and give out waste products. Thermodynamics of open systems is\ncurrently often considered in terms of passages from one state of\nthermodynamic equilibrium to another, or in terms of flows in the\napproximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium. The problem for living\norganisms may be further simplified by the approximation of assuming a steady\nstate with unchanging flows. General principles of entropy production for such\napproximations are subject to [unsettled current debate or\nresearch](/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics \"Non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics\"). Nevertheless, ideas derived from this viewpoint on the\nsecond law of thermodynamics are enlightening about living creatures.\n\n## Gravitational\nsystems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Gravitational systems\")]\n\nIn systems that do not require for their descriptions the general theory of\nrelativity, bodies always have positive [heat capacity](/wiki/Heat_capacity\n\"Heat capacity\"), meaning that the temperature rises with energy. Therefore,\nwhen energy flows from a high-temperature object to a low-temperature object,\nthe source temperature is decreased while the sink temperature is increased;\nhence temperature differences tend to diminish over time. This is not always\nthe case for systems in which the gravitational force is important and the\ngeneral theory of relativity is required. Such systems can spontaneously\nchange towards uneven spread of mass and energy. This applies to the universe\nin large scale, and consequently it may be difficult or impossible to apply\nthe second law to it.[63] Beyond this, the thermodynamics of systems described\nby the general theory of relativity is beyond the scope of the present\narticle.\n\n## Non-equilibrium\nstates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Non-equilibrium states\")]\n\nMain article: [Non-equilibrium thermodynamics](/wiki/Non-\nequilibrium_thermodynamics \"Non-equilibrium thermodynamics\")\n\nThe theory of classical or [equilibrium\nthermodynamics](/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium \"Thermodynamic equilibrium\")\nis idealized. A main postulate or assumption, often not even explicitly\nstated, is the existence of systems in their own internal states of\nthermodynamic equilibrium. In general, a region of space containing a physical\nsystem at a given time, that may be found in nature, is not in thermodynamic\nequilibrium, read in the most stringent terms. In looser terms, nothing in the\nentire universe is or has ever been truly in exact thermodynamic\nequilibrium.[63][64]\n\nFor purposes of physical analysis, it is often enough convenient to make an\nassumption of [thermodynamic equilibrium](/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium\n\"Thermodynamic equilibrium\"). Such an assumption may rely on trial and error\nfor its justification. If the assumption is justified, it can often be very\nvaluable and useful because it makes available the theory of thermodynamics.\nElements of the equilibrium assumption are that a system is observed to be\nunchanging over an indefinitely long time, and that there are so many\nparticles in a system, that its particulate nature can be entirely ignored.\nUnder such an equilibrium assumption, in general, there are no macroscopically\ndetectable [fluctuations](/wiki/Thermal_fluctuations \"Thermal fluctuations\").\nThere is an exception, the case of [critical\nstates](/wiki/Critical_point_\\(thermodynamics\\) \"Critical point\n\\(thermodynamics\\)\"), which exhibit to the naked eye the phenomenon of\n[critical opalescence](/wiki/Critical_opalescence \"Critical opalescence\"). For\nlaboratory studies of critical states, exceptionally long observation times\nare needed.\n\nIn all cases, the assumption of [thermodynamic\nequilibrium](/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium \"Thermodynamic equilibrium\"),\nonce made, implies as a consequence that no putative candidate \"fluctuation\"\nalters the entropy of the system.\n\nIt can easily happen that a physical system exhibits internal macroscopic\nchanges that are fast enough to invalidate the assumption of the constancy of\nthe entropy. Or that a physical system has so few particles that the\nparticulate nature is manifest in observable fluctuations. Then the assumption\nof thermodynamic equilibrium is to be abandoned. There is no unqualified\ngeneral definition of entropy for non-equilibrium states.[65]\n\nThere are intermediate cases, in which the assumption of local [thermodynamic\nequilibrium](/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium \"Thermodynamic equilibrium\") is a\nvery good approximation,[66][67][68][69] but strictly speaking it is still an\napproximation, not theoretically ideal. For non-equilibrium situations in\ngeneral, it may be useful to consider statistical mechanical definitions of\nother quantities that may be conveniently called 'entropy', but they should\nnot be confused or conflated with thermodynamic entropy properly defined for\nthe second law. These other quantities indeed belong to statistical mechanics,\nnot to thermodynamics, the primary realm of the second law.\n\nEven though the applicability of the second law of thermodynamics is limited\nfor non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing such systems are still being\ndiscussed. One of the guiding principles for systems which are far from\nequilibrium is the maximum entropy production principle.[70][71] It states\nthat a system away from equilibrium evolves in such a way as to maximize\nentropy production, given present constraints.[72]\n\nThe physics of macroscopically observable fluctuations is beyond the scope of\nthis article.\n\n## Arrow of\ntime[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Arrow of time\")]\n\nFurther information: [Entropy (arrow of time)](/wiki/Entropy_\\(arrow_of_time\\)\n\"Entropy \\(arrow of time\\)\")\n\nThermodynamic Asymmetry in Time\n\nSee also: [Arrow of time](/wiki/Arrow_of_time \"Arrow of time\")\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics is a physical law that is not symmetric to\nreversal of the time direction. This does not conflict with notions that have\nbeen observed of the fundamental laws of physics, namely [CPT\nsymmetry](/wiki/CPT_symmetry \"CPT symmetry\"), since the second law applies\nstatistically, it is hypothesized, on time-asymmetric _boundary\nconditions_.[73]\n\nThe second law has been proposed to supply a partial explanation of the\ndifference between moving forward and backwards in time, such as why the cause\nprecedes the effect ([the causal arrow of\ntime](/wiki/Arrow_of_time#The_causal_arrow_of_time \"Arrow of time\")).[74]\n\n##\nIrreversibility[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Irreversibility\")]\n\nIrreversibility in [thermodynamic processes](/wiki/Thermodynamic_process\n\"Thermodynamic process\") is a consequence of the asymmetric character of\nthermodynamic operations, and not of any internally irreversible microscopic\nproperties of the bodies. Thermodynamic operations are macroscopic external\ninterventions imposed on the participating bodies, not derived from their\ninternal properties. There are reputed \"paradoxes\" that arise from failure to\nrecognize this.\n\n### Loschmidt's\nparadox[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Loschmidt's paradox\")]\n\nMain article: [Loschmidt's paradox](/wiki/Loschmidt%27s_paradox \"Loschmidt's\nparadox\")\n\n[Loschmidt's paradox](/wiki/Loschmidt%27s_paradox \"Loschmidt's paradox\"), also\nknown as the reversibility paradox, is the objection that it should not be\npossible to deduce an irreversible process from the time-symmetric dynamics\nthat describe the microscopic evolution of a macroscopic system.\n\nIn the opinion of [Schrödinger](/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger \"Erwin\nSchrödinger\"), \"It is now quite obvious in what manner you have to reformulate\nthe law of entropy—or for that matter, all other irreversible statements—so\nthat they be capable of being derived from reversible models. You must not\nspeak of one isolated system but at least of two, which you may for the moment\nconsider isolated from the rest of the world, but not always from each\nother.\"[75] The two systems are isolated from each other by the wall, until it\nis removed by the thermodynamic operation, as envisaged by the law. The\nthermodynamic operation is externally imposed, not subject to the reversible\nmicroscopic dynamical laws that govern the constituents of the systems. It is\nthe cause of the irreversibility. The statement of the law in this present\narticle complies with Schrödinger's advice. The cause–effect relation is\nlogically prior to the second law, not derived from it.\n\n### Poincaré recurrence\ntheorem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Poincaré recurrence theorem\")]\n\nMain article: [Poincaré recurrence\ntheorem](/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_recurrence_theorem \"Poincaré recurrence theorem\")\n\nThe [Poincaré recurrence theorem](/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_recurrence_theorem\n\"Poincaré recurrence theorem\") considers a theoretical microscopic description\nof an isolated physical system. This may be considered as a model of a\nthermodynamic system after a thermodynamic operation has removed an internal\nwall. The system will, after a sufficiently long time, return to a\nmicroscopically defined state very close to the initial one. The Poincaré\nrecurrence time is the length of time elapsed until the return. It is\nexceedingly long, likely longer than the life of the universe, and depends\nsensitively on the geometry of the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic\noperation. The recurrence theorem may be perceived as apparently contradicting\nthe second law of thermodynamics. More obviously, however, it is simply a\nmicroscopic model of thermodynamic equilibrium in an isolated system formed by\nremoval of a wall between two systems. For a typical thermodynamical system,\nthe recurrence time is so large (many many times longer than the lifetime of\nthe universe) that, for all practical purposes, one cannot observe the\nrecurrence. One might wish, nevertheless, to imagine that one could wait for\nthe Poincaré recurrence, and then re-insert the wall that was removed by the\nthermodynamic operation. It is then evident that the appearance of\nirreversibility is due to the utter unpredictability of the Poincaré\nrecurrence given only that the initial state was one of thermodynamic\nequilibrium, as is the case in macroscopic thermodynamics. Even if one could\nwait for it, one has no practical possibility of picking the right instant at\nwhich to re-insert the wall. The Poincaré recurrence theorem provides a\nsolution to Loschmidt's paradox. If an isolated thermodynamic system could be\nmonitored over increasingly many multiples of the average Poincaré recurrence\ntime, the thermodynamic behavior of the system would become invariant under\ntime reversal.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/James-clerk-\nmaxwell3.jpg/170px-James-clerk-maxwell3.jpg)](/wiki/File:James-clerk-\nmaxwell3.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:James-clerk-maxwell3.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n\n### Maxwell's\ndemon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Maxwell's demon\")]\n\nMain article: [Maxwell's demon](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon \"Maxwell's demon\")\n\n[James Clerk Maxwell](/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell \"James Clerk Maxwell\")\nimagined one container divided into two parts, _A_ and _B_. Both parts are\nfilled with the same [gas](/wiki/Gas \"Gas\") at equal temperatures and placed\nnext to each other, separated by a wall. Observing the\n[molecules](/wiki/Molecule \"Molecule\") on both sides, an imaginary\n[demon](/wiki/Demon \"Demon\") guards a microscopic trapdoor in the wall. When a\nfaster-than-average molecule from _A_ flies towards the trapdoor, the demon\nopens it, and the molecule will fly from _A_ to _B_. The average\n[speed](/wiki/Speed \"Speed\") of the molecules in _B_ will have increased while\nin _A_ they will have slowed down on average. Since average molecular speed\ncorresponds to temperature, the temperature decreases in _A_ and increases in\n_B_ , contrary to the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nOne response to this question was suggested in 1929 by [Leó\nSzilárd](/wiki/Le%C3%B3_Szil%C3%A1rd \"Leó Szilárd\") and later by [Léon\nBrillouin](/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Brillouin \"Léon Brillouin\"). Szilárd pointed out\nthat a real-life Maxwell's demon would need to have some means of measuring\nmolecular speed, and that the act of acquiring information would require an\nexpenditure of energy.\n\nMaxwell's demon repeatedly alters the permeability of the wall between _A_ and\n_B_. It is therefore performing [thermodynamic\noperations](/wiki/Thermodynamic_operation \"Thermodynamic operation\") on a\nmicroscopic scale, not just observing ordinary spontaneous or natural\nmacroscopic thermodynamic processes.\n\n##\nQuotations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Quotations\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png) | Wikiquote has quotations related to: _**[Second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Special:Search/Second_law_of_thermodynamics \"q:Special:Search/Second law of thermodynamics\")**_  \n---|---  \n  \n> The law that entropy always increases holds, I think, the supreme position\n> among the [laws of Nature](/wiki/Laws_of_science \"Laws of science\").
