In Canada, the\nseries is primarily broadcast on TVOntario, which first ran previews of the\nshow in August 2013. The series first aired on [Nickelodeon](/wiki/Nickelodeon\n\"Nickelodeon\") in the United States on August 12, 2013.\n\nThe series focuses on a boy named Ryder who leads a pack of [search and rescue\ndogs](/wiki/Search_and_rescue_dog \"Search and rescue dog\") known as the PAW\nPatrol. They work together on missions to protect the shoreside community of\nAdventure Bay. Each dog has a specific set of skills based on a real-life\nprofession, such as a [firefighter](/wiki/Firefighter \"Firefighter\") and a\n[police officer](/wiki/Police_officer \"Police officer\"). They all reside in\n[doghouses](/wiki/Doghouse \"Doghouse\") that can transform into customized\nvehicles when necessary. They are also equipped with backpacks called \"pup\npacks\" that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.\n\nSpin Master has developed the show into a [media\nfranchise](/wiki/Media_franchise \"Media franchise\") and released an ongoing\nline of toys based on it. _PAW Patrol_ toy sales have generated millions of\ndollars in revenue for the corporation and increased Spin Master's presence in\nthe preschool toy market.[1] The show, and its associated products, have\nreceived a variety of awards and nominations from associations such as the\n[Academy of Canadian Cinema &\nTelevision](/wiki/Academy_of_Canadian_Cinema_%26_Television \"Academy of\nCanadian Cinema & Television\") and the [Academy of Television Arts &\nSciences](/wiki/Academy_of_Television_Arts_%26_Sciences \"Academy of Television\nArts & Sciences\").\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Format\n  * 2 Episodes\n  * 3 Characters\n    * 3.1 PAW Patrol members\n      * 3.1.1 Original members\n      * 3.1.2 Later members\n    * 3.2 Recurring\n  * 4 Production\n  * 5 Release\n    * 5.1 Broadcast\n    * 5.2 DVD releases\n    * 5.3 Video game\n  * 6 Reception\n    * 6.1 Critical reception\n    * 6.2 Ratings\n    * 6.3 Cultural impact\n    * 6.4 Accolades\n  * 7 Related media\n    * 7.1 Film\n    * 7.2 Merchandise\n    * 7.3 Live events\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Format[[edit](/w/index.php?title=PAW_Patrol&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Format\")]\n\nEach episode of _PAW Patrol_ follows a similar pattern and features recurring\nthemes. Episodes normally open with a scene depicting the dogs going about\ntheir everyday lives, often playing with [dog toys](/wiki/Dog_toy \"Dog toy\")\nor engaging in activities at the local playground. Ryder, a ten-year-old boy,\nis advised of a problem by receiving a call for help or by witnessing a\nsituation himself. His most frequent caller is an accident-prone [marine\nbiologist](/wiki/Marine_biology \"Marine biology\") named Cap'n Turbot, who\nknows much about Adventure Bay's wildlife. Ryder always alerts the dogs via\ntheir blinking [pet tags](/wiki/Pet_tag \"Pet tag\"). The team members report to\ntheir base, the Lookout, and enter its elevator. Marshall typically arrives\nlast causing a humorous mishap that makes the other dogs laugh as the elevator\nrises. When they reach the top floor, they arrange themselves in a line. Chase\nannounces that the team is ready for action as Ryder tells the pups what has\nhappened. He chooses several members of the team, normally two [first\nresponders](/wiki/First_responder \"First responder\"), to help solve whatever\nproblem has emerged. They ride a slide down to their vehicles and complete\ntheir mission. When they have finished, Ryder says his catchphrase: \"Whenever\nyou're in trouble, just yelp for help!\", and congratulates the pups.\n\n## Episodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=PAW_Patrol&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Episodes\")]\n\nMain article: [List of PAW Patrol episodes](/wiki/List_of_PAW_Patrol_episodes\n\"List of PAW Patrol episodes\")\n\nSeason| Episodes| Originally aired  \n---|---|---  \nFirst aired| Last aired  \n| [1](/wiki/List_of_PAW_Patrol_episodes#Season_1_\\(2013–2014\\) \"List of PAW\nPatrol episodes\")| 26| August 12, 2013 (2013-08-12)| August 18, 2014\n(2014-08-18)  \n| [2](/wiki/List_of_PAW_Patrol_episodes#Season_2_\\(2014–2015\\) \"List of PAW\nPatrol episodes\")| 26[2]| August 13, 2014 (2014-08-13)| December 4, 2015\n(2015-12-04)  \n| [3](/wiki/List_of_PAW_Patrol_episodes#Season_3_\\(2015–2017\\) \"List of PAW\nPatrol episodes\")| 26| November 20, 2015 (2015-11-20)| January 26, 2017\n(2017-01-26)  \n| [4](/wiki/List_of_PAW_Patrol_episodes#Season_4_\\(2017–2018\\) \"List of PAW\nPatrol episodes\")| 26| February 6, 2017 (2017-02-06)| February 3, 2018\n(2018-02-03)  \n| [5](/wiki/List_of_PAW_Patrol_episodes#Season_5_\\(2018\\) \"List of PAW Patrol\nepisodes\")| 26[3]| February 6, 2018 (2018-02-06)[4]| TBA  \n  \n## Characters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=PAW_Patrol&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Characters\")]\n\n### PAW Patrol\nmembers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=PAW_Patrol&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: PAW Patrol members\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/27/PAW_Patrol_main_characters%2C_cast_promo_art.png)](/wiki/File:PAW_Patrol_main_characters,_cast_promo_art.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PAW_Patrol_main_characters,_cast_promo_art.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe illustrated designs of the entire PAW Patrol team as of Tracker's\nintroduction.\n\n#### Original\nmembers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=PAW_Patrol&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Original members\")]\n\n  * Ryder is the human leader of the PAW Patrol.

Spin Master hired toy designers to develop the\nformat further; after the concept was in place, they began designing\nmerchandise.[6]\n\nChapman's original pitch focused on the idea that the six PAW Patrol dogs were\nrescued by Ryder before joining the team. [Scott Kraft](/wiki/Scott_Kraft\n\"Scott Kraft\"), the show's first writer, and Jamie Whitney, the show's first\ndirector, decided to abandon the rescued dog theme in 2012. The name of the\nseries' protagonist, Ryder, was changed multiple times during production; he\nwas originally called Raffi, Roddy, and Robbie before Spin Master settled on\nRyder.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7b/PAW_Patrol_original_character_designs.png/300px-\nPAW_Patrol_original_character_designs.png)](/wiki/File:PAW_Patrol_original_character_designs.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PAW_Patrol_original_character_designs.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nEarly models of the _PAW Patrol_ pups\n\nAccording to a 2017 Spin Master interview, \"everything pup-related was debated\nendlessly: names, sizes, ages, breeds.\"[7] The pups' designs underwent major\nchanges after Chapman's pitch; they were originally very realistic, with\nunique fur and textures based on their breeds, but they were later simplified\nand made more cartoonish. The visual appearance of Cap'n Turbot, mainly his\ndistinctive bead eyes and large nose, was based on the design of Chapman's Bob\nthe Builder character. Ryder's hairstyle was based on that of Ronnen\nHarary.[7]\n\nIn January 2012, Spin Master began approaching television broadcasters. The\ncompany negotiated a broadcast partnership with Nickelodeon, and the network\nfirst announced that it had picked up _PAW Patrol_ at the 2013 Licensing Expo\nin Las Vegas, Nevada.[8] The series became Spin Master's first solely-owned\n[intellectual property](/wiki/Intellectual_property \"Intellectual property\")\n(IP)[9] once it was released in August 2013.[10]\n\nSince it began production, the show's animation has been provided by [Guru\nStudio](/wiki/Guru_Studio \"Guru Studio\"). In a 2016 interview with _[Maclean's\nMagazine](/wiki/Maclean%27s \"Maclean's\")_, Guru president Frank Falcone stated\nthat his studio's animators were originally suspicious of the show's\n\"[toyetic](/wiki/Toyetic \"Toyetic\")\" concept.[11] The series' rock-\ninspired[12] [original score](/wiki/Film_score \"Film score\") was composed by\nthe Ontario-based group [Voodoo Highway Music &\nPost](/wiki/Voodoo_Highway_Music_%26_Post_Inc. \"Voodoo Highway Music & Post\nInc.\"). The opening theme song, and the ending song used in each episode\ninclude vocals performed by Scott Simons.\n\nWith each season of the show, new supporting characters and themes are\nintroduced in its episodes. In a May 2016 interview for the _[Toronto\nStar](/wiki/Toronto_Star \"Toronto Star\")_ , Spin Master president Ben Gadbois\nstated that his company would continue to introduce additional characters and\nconcepts to increase the franchise's longevity and to expand upon the success\nof tie-in merchandise.[13] In August of the same year, Ronnen Harary explained\nthat these changes were intended to keep the show's content \"fresh\" and\n\"relevant\".[14]\n\n## Release[[edit](/w/index.php?title=PAW_Patrol&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Release\")]\n\n### Broadcast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=PAW_Patrol&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Broadcast\")]\n\nThe series has been sold to TV networks in over 160 countries.[15]\n\nIn Canada, the series is primarily shown on [TVOntario](/wiki/TVOntario\n\"TVOntario\") during the [TVOKids](/wiki/TVOKids \"TVOKids\") block.[16]\n[Knowledge Network](/wiki/Knowledge_Network \"Knowledge Network\"), [Télé-\nQuébec](/wiki/T%C3%A9l%C3%A9-Qu%C3%A9bec \"Télé-Québec\") and [City\nSaskatchewan](/wiki/City_Saskatchewan \"City Saskatchewan\") also air reruns of\nthe show in different Canadian provinces.
