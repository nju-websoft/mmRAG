[presiding\nofficer](/wiki/Speaker_\\(politics\\) \"Speaker \\(politics\\)\") of the [United\nStates House of Representatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"United States House of Representatives\"). The office was established in 1789\nby [Article I](/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article\nOne of the United States Constitution\"), [Section\n2](/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_2:_House_of_Representatives\n\"Article One of the United States Constitution\") of the [United States\nConstitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\").\nThe Speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House of\nRepresentatives, and is simultaneously the House's presiding officer, _de\nfacto_ leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's\nadministrative head. Speakers also perform various other administrative and\nprocedural functions. Given these several roles and responsibilities, the\nSpeaker usually does not personally preside over debates. That duty is instead\ndelegated to members of the House from the majority party. Neither does the\nSpeaker regularly participate in floor debates or vote.\n\nThe Constitution does not require the Speaker to be an elected member of the\nHouse of Representatives, although every Speaker thus far has been.[3] The\nSpeaker is second in the [United States presidential line of\nsuccession](/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession \"United States\npresidential line of succession\"), after the [Vice\nPresident](/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States \"Vice President of the\nUnited States\") and ahead of the [President _pro tempore_ of the U.S.\nSenate](/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate \"President pro\ntempore of the United States Senate\").[4]\n\nThe current House Speaker is Congressman [Paul Ryan](/wiki/Paul_Ryan \"Paul\nRyan\") from [Wisconsin](/wiki/Wisconsin \"Wisconsin\"). He was elected to the\noffice on [October 29,\n2015](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_election,_October_2015\n\"Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, October\n2015\"), and is the [54th person to\nserve](/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives\") as Speaker.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Selection\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 Notable elections\n  * 3 Partisan role\n  * 4 Presiding officer\n  * 5 Other functions\n  * 6 List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives\n  * 7 Recent election results\n    * 7.1 January 2011\n    * 7.2 January 2013\n    * 7.3 January 2015\n    * 7.4 October 2015\n    * 7.5 January 2017\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 Bibliography\n  * 10 Notes\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n##\nSelection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Selection\")]\n\nThe House of Representatives elects the Speaker of the House on the first day\nof every new Congress and in the event of the death, resignation or removal\nfrom the Chair of an incumbent Speaker.[5] The [Clerk of the House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/Clerk_of_the_House_of_Representatives \"Clerk of the\nHouse of Representatives\") requests nominations: there are normally two, one\nfrom each major party (each party having previously met to decide on its\nnominee). The Clerk then calls the roll of the Representatives, each\nRepresentative indicating the surname of the candidate the Representative is\nsupporting. Representatives are not restricted to voting for one of the\nnominated candidates and may vote for any person, even for someone who is not\na member of the House at all. They may also abstain by voting \"present\".[6]\n\nAlthough no rule exists, based on tradition and practice from the earliest\ndays of the nation, to be elected speaker a candidate must receive an absolute\nmajority of all votes cast for individuals, i.e. excluding those who abstain.\nIf no candidate wins such a majority, then the roll call is repeated until a\nspeaker is elected. The last time repeated votes were required was in 1923,\nwhen the Speaker was elected on the ninth ballot.[6]\n\nThe new Speaker is then sworn in by the [Dean of the United States House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/Dean_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Dean of the United States House of Representatives\"), the chamber's longest-\nserving member.\n\nIn modern practice, the Speaker is chosen by the majority party from among its\nsenior leaders either when a vacancy in the office arrives or when the\nmajority party changes. Previous Speakers have been minority leaders (when the\nmajority party changes, as they are already the House party leader, and as the\nminority leader are usually their party's nominee for Speaker), or majority\nleaders (upon departure of the current Speaker in the majority party),\nassuming that the party leadership hierarchy is followed. In the past, other\ncandidates have included chairpersons of influential [standing\ncommittees](/wiki/Standing_committee_\\(United_States_Congress\\) \"Standing\ncommittee \\(United States Congress\\)\").\n\nSo far, the Democrats have always elevated their minority leader to the\nspeakership upon reclaiming majority control of the House. However,\nRepublicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern. In\n1919, Republicans bypassed [James Robert\nMann](/wiki/James_Robert_Mann_\\(Illinois\\) \"James Robert Mann \\(Illinois\\)\"),\nR-IL, who had been Minority Leader for eight years, and elected a\n[backbencher](/wiki/Backbencher \"Backbencher\") representative, [Frederick H.\nGillett](/wiki/Frederick_H._Gillett \"Frederick H. Gillett\"), R-MA, to be\nSpeaker. Mann had \"angered many Republicans by objecting to their [private\nbills](/wiki/Private_bill \"Private bill\") on the floor,\" and was also a\nprotégé of autocratic Speaker [Joseph Gurney\nCannon](/wiki/Joseph_Gurney_Cannon \"Joseph Gurney Cannon\") (R-IL18) who had\nbeen Speaker from 1903 to 1911, and was still in the House. Many members\n\"suspected that he [Mann] would try to [re-centralize](/wiki/Centralisation\n\"Centralisation\") power in his hands if elected Speaker.\"[7] More recently,\nalthough [Robert H. Michel](/wiki/Robert_H._Michel \"Robert H. Michel\") was\nMinority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans [regained control of the\nHouse](/wiki/Republican_Revolution \"Republican Revolution\") in the [1994\nmidterm elections](/wiki/United_States_elections,_1994 \"United States\nelections, 1994\"), he had already announced his retirement and had little or\nno involvement in the campaign, including the \"[Contract with\nAmerica](/wiki/Contract_with_America \"Contract with America\")\", which was\nunveiled six weeks before Election Day. Michel opted not to seek re-election\nbecause he had been isolated in the caucus by [Minority\nWhip](/wiki/Minority_Whip \"Minority Whip\") [Newt Gingrich](/wiki/Newt_Gingrich\n\"Newt Gingrich\") and other younger and more aggressive Congressmen.\n\nIt is expected that members of the House vote for their party's candidate. If\nthey do not, they usually vote for someone else in their party or vote\n\"present\". Those who vote for the other party's candidate often face serious\nconsequences, up to and including the loss of seniority. The last instance\nwhere a representative voted for the other party's candidate was in 2000, when\nDemocrat [Jim Traficant](/wiki/Jim_Traficant \"Jim Traficant\") of\n[Ohio](/wiki/Ohio \"Ohio\") voted for Republican [Dennis\nHastert](/wiki/Dennis_Hastert \"Dennis Hastert\"). In response, the Democrats\nstripped him of his seniority and he lost all of his committee posts.\n\nIf the Speaker's party loses control of the House in an election, and if the\nSpeaker and Majority Leader both remain in the leadership hierarchy, they\nwould become the Minority Leader and Minority Whip, respectively. As the\nminority party has historically had one less leadership position after losing\nthe Speaker's chair, there may be a contest for the remaining leadership\npositions; upon losing control of the House after the 2010 election, the\nDemocrats created the position of Assistant Democratic Leader in order to\nprevent such a contest. Most Speakers whose party has lost control of the\nHouse have not returned to the party leadership ([Tom Foley](/wiki/Tom_Foley\n\"Tom Foley\") lost his seat, [Dennis Hastert](/wiki/Dennis_Hastert \"Dennis\nHastert\") returned to the backbenches and resigned from the House in late\n2007). However, Speakers [Joseph William Martin,\nJr.](/wiki/Joseph_William_Martin,_Jr. \"Joseph William Martin, Jr.\") and [Sam\nRayburn](/wiki/Sam_Rayburn \"Sam Rayburn\") did seek the post of Minority Leader\nin the late 1940s and early 1950s. [Nancy Pelosi](/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi \"Nancy\nPelosi\") is the most recent example of an outgoing Speaker who was elected\nMinority Leader, after the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010\nelections.\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Muhlenberg.jpg/170px-\nMuhlenberg.jpg)](/wiki/File:Muhlenberg.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Muhlenberg.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Frederick Muhlenberg](/wiki/Frederick_Muhlenberg \"Frederick Muhlenberg\")\n(1789–1791, 1793–1795), was the first Speaker.\n\nThe first Speaker was [Frederick Muhlenberg](/wiki/Frederick_Muhlenberg\n\"Frederick Muhlenberg\"): he was elected as a Pro-Administration candidate to\nthe 1st Congress, an Anti-Administration candidate to the 2nd and 3rd\nCongresses, and a Republican candidate to the 4th Congress,[8] according to\nthe _[Biographical Directory of\nCongress](/wiki/Biographical_Directory_of_Congress \"Biographical Directory of\nCongress\")_ , though Oswald Seidensticker wrote that he was elected as a\n[Federalist](/wiki/Federalist_Party \"Federalist Party\") for the first four\nCongresses.[9]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Clay-\nstanding.jpg/220px-Clay-standing.jpg)](/wiki/File:Clay-standing.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Clay-standing.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Henry Clay](/wiki/Henry_Clay \"Henry Clay\") (1813–1814, 1815–1820, 1823–1825)\nused his influence as speaker to ensure the passage of measures he favored\n\nThe position of Speaker started to gain its partisan role and its power in\nlegislative development under [Henry Clay](/wiki/Henry_Clay \"Henry Clay\")\n(1811–1814, 1815–1820, and 1823–1825).[10] In contrast to many of his\npredecessors, Clay participated in several debates, and used his influence to\nprocure the passage of measures he supported—for instance, the declaration of\nthe [War of 1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\"), and various laws relating\nto Clay's \"[American System](/wiki/American_System_\\(economic_plan\\) \"American\nSystem \\(economic plan\\)\")\" economic plan. Furthermore, when no candidate\nreceived an [Electoral College](/wiki/Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Electoral College \\(United States\\)\") majority in the [1824 presidential\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824 \"United States\npresidential election, 1824\") causing the President to be elected by the\nHouse, Speaker Clay threw his support to [John Quincy\nAdams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John Quincy Adams\") instead of [Andrew\nJackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew Jackson\"), thereby ensuring Adams'\nvictory. Following Clay's retirement in 1825, the power of the speakership\nonce again began to decline, despite speakership elections becoming\nincreasingly bitter. As the [Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American\nCivil War\") approached, several sectional factions nominated their own\ncandidates, often making it difficult for any candidate to attain a majority.\nIn 1855 and again in 1859, for example, the contest for Speaker lasted for two\nmonths before the House achieved a result. During this time, Speakers tended\nto have very short tenures. For example, from 1839 to 1863 there were eleven\nSpeakers, only one of whom served for more than one term. To date, [James K.\nPolk](/wiki/James_K._Polk \"James K. Polk\") is the only Speaker of the House\nlater elected President of the United States.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/JGCannon.jpg/170px-\nJGCannon.jpg)](/wiki/File:JGCannon.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:JGCannon.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Joseph Gurney Cannon](/wiki/Joseph_Gurney_Cannon \"Joseph Gurney Cannon\")\n(1903–1911) was one of the most powerful speakers.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the office of Speaker began to develop\ninto a very powerful one. At the time, one of the most important sources of\nthe Speaker's power was his position as Chairman of the [Committee on\nRules](/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules \"United States House\nCommittee on Rules\"), which, after the reorganization of the committee system\nin 1880, became one of the most powerful standing committees of the House.\nFurthermore, several Speakers became leading figures in their political\nparties; examples include Democrats [Samuel J.\nRandall](/wiki/Samuel_J._Randall \"Samuel J. Randall\"), [John Griffin\nCarlisle](/wiki/John_Griffin_Carlisle \"John Griffin Carlisle\"), and [Charles\nF. Crisp](/wiki/Charles_Frederick_Crisp \"Charles Frederick Crisp\"), and\nRepublicans [James G. Blaine](/wiki/James_G._Blaine \"James G. Blaine\"),\n[Thomas Brackett Reed](/wiki/Thomas_Brackett_Reed \"Thomas Brackett Reed\"), and\n[Joseph Gurney Cannon](/wiki/Joseph_Gurney_Cannon \"Joseph Gurney Cannon\").\n\nThe power of the Speaker was greatly augmented during the tenure of the\nRepublican [Thomas Brackett Reed](/wiki/Thomas_Brackett_Reed \"Thomas Brackett\nReed\") (1889–1891, 1895–1899). \"Czar Reed\", as he was called by his\nopponents,[11] sought to end the obstruction of bills by the minority, in\nparticular by countering the tactic known as the \"[disappearing\nquorum](/wiki/Disappearing_quorum \"Disappearing quorum\")\".[12] By refusing to\nvote on a motion, the minority could ensure that a quorum would not be\nachieved, and that the result would be invalid. Reed, however, declared that\nmembers who were in the chamber but refused to vote would still count for the\npurposes of determining a quorum. Through these and other rulings, Reed\nensured that the Democrats could not block the Republican agenda.\n\nThe speakership reached its apogee during the term of Republican [Joseph\nGurney Cannon](/wiki/Joseph_Gurney_Cannon \"Joseph Gurney Cannon\") (1903–1911).\nCannon exercised extraordinary control over the legislative process. He\ndetermined the agenda of the House, appointed the members of all committees,\nchose committee chairmen, headed the Rules Committee, and determined which\ncommittee heard each bill. He vigorously used his powers to ensure that\nRepublican proposals were passed by the House. In 1910, however, Democrats and\nseveral dissatisfied Republicans joined together to strip Cannon of many of\nhis powers, including the ability to name committee members and his\nchairmanship of the Rules Committee.[13] Fifteen years later, Speaker\n[Nicholas Longworth](/wiki/Nicholas_Longworth \"Nicholas Longworth\") restored\nmuch, but not all, of the lost influence of the position.\n\nOne of the most influential Speakers in history was Democrat [Sam\nRayburn](/wiki/Sam_Rayburn \"Sam Rayburn\").[14] Rayburn was the longest-serving\nSpeaker in history, holding office from 1940 to 1947, 1949 to 1953, and 1955\nto 1961. He helped shape many bills, working quietly in the background with\nHouse committees. He also helped ensure the passage of several domestic\nmeasures and foreign assistance programs advocated by Presidents [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\") and [Harry\nTruman](/wiki/Harry_Truman \"Harry Truman\"). Rayburn's successor, Democrat\n[John William McCormack](/wiki/John_William_McCormack \"John William\nMcCormack\") (served 1962–1971), was a somewhat less influential speaker,\nparticularly because of dissent from younger members of the Democratic Party.\nDuring the mid-1970s, the power of the speakership once again grew under\nDemocrat [Carl Albert](/wiki/Carl_Albert \"Carl Albert\"). The Committee on\nRules ceased to be a semi-independent panel, as it had been since 1910.\nInstead, it once again became an arm of the party leadership. Moreover, in\n1975, the Speaker was granted the authority to appoint a majority of the\nmembers of the Rules Committee. Meanwhile, the power of committee chairmen was\ncurtailed, further increasing the relative influence of the Speaker.\n\nAlbert's successor, Democrat [Tip O'Neill](/wiki/Tip_O%27Neill \"Tip O'Neill\"),\nwas a prominent Speaker because of his public opposition to the policies of\nPresident [Ronald Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan \"Ronald Reagan\"). O'Neill is the\nlongest continually serving Speaker, from 1977 through 1987. He challenged\nReagan on domestic programs and on defense expenditures. Republicans made\nO'Neill the target of their election campaigns in 1980 and 1982 but Democrats\nmanaged to retain their majorities in both years.\n\nThe roles of the parties reversed in 1994 when, after spending forty years in\nthe minority, the Republicans regained control of the House with the\n\"[Contract with America](/wiki/Contract_with_America \"Contract with\nAmerica\")\", an idea spearheaded by [Minority Whip](/wiki/Minority_Whip\n\"Minority Whip\") [Newt Gingrich](/wiki/Newt_Gingrich \"Newt Gingrich\"). Speaker\nGingrich would regularly clash with Democratic President [Bill\nClinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\"), leading to the [United States\nfederal government shutdown of 1995 and\n1996](/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_1995_and_1996 \"United\nStates federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996\"), in which Clinton was\nlargely seen to have prevailed. Gingrich's hold on the leadership was weakened\nsignificantly by that and several other controversies, and he faced a caucus\nrevolt in 1997. After the Republicans lost House seats in 1998 (although\nretaining a majority) he did not stand for a third term as Speaker. His\nsuccessor, [Dennis Hastert](/wiki/Dennis_Hastert \"Dennis Hastert\"), had been\nchosen as a compromise candidate, since the other Republicans in the\nleadership were more controversial. Hastert played a much less prominent role\nthan other contemporary Speakers, being overshadowed by House Majority Leader\n[Tom DeLay](/wiki/Tom_DeLay \"Tom DeLay\") and President [George W.\nBush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W. Bush\"). The Republicans came out of the\n2000 elections with a further reduced majority but made small gains in 2002\nand 2004. The periods of 2001–2002 and 2003–2007 were the first times since\n1953–1955 that there was single-party Republican leadership in Washington,\ninterrupted from 2001–2003 as Senator [Jim Jeffords](/wiki/Jim_Jeffords \"Jim\nJeffords\") of [Vermont](/wiki/Vermont \"Vermont\") left the Republican Party to\nbecome independent and caucused with Senate Democrats to give them a 51-49\nmajority.\n\nIn the [2006 midterm elections](/wiki/United_States_House_elections,_2006\n\"United States House elections, 2006\"), the Democrats won a majority in the\nHouse. [Nancy Pelosi](/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi \"Nancy Pelosi\") became Speaker when\nthe [110th Congress](/wiki/110th_United_States_Congress \"110th United States\nCongress\") convened on January 4, 2007, making her the first female to hold\nthe office. With the election of Barack Obama as President and Democratic\ngains in both houses of Congress, Pelosi became the first Speaker since [Tom\nFoley](/wiki/Tom_Foley \"Tom Foley\") to hold the office during single-party\nDemocratic leadership in Washington.[15] During the [111th\nCongress](/wiki/111th_Congress \"111th Congress\"), Pelosi was the driving force\nbehind several of Obama's major initiatives that proved controversial, and the\nRepublicans campaigned against the Democrats' legislation by staging a \"Fire\nPelosi\" bus tour[16] and regained control of the House in the [2010 midterm\nelections](/wiki/United_States_House_elections,_2010 \"United States House\nelections, 2010\"). House Minority Leader [John Boehner](/wiki/John_Boehner\n\"John Boehner\") was elected as Speaker.[17]\n\n### Notable\nelections[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Notable elections\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/2007SOU_Bush_Cheney_Pelosi.jpg/220px-2007SOU_Bush_Cheney_Pelosi.jpg)](/wiki/File:2007SOU_Bush_Cheney_Pelosi.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:2007SOU_Bush_Cheney_Pelosi.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSpeaker [Nancy Pelosi](/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi \"Nancy Pelosi\") (right) with Vice\nPresident [Dick Cheney](/wiki/Dick_Cheney \"Dick Cheney\") behind President\nGeorge W.

elections to the\nspeakership, such as the contest of 1839. In that case, even though the [26th\nUnited States Congress](/wiki/26th_United_States_Congress \"26th United States\nCongress\") convened on December 2, the House could not begin the speakership\nelection until December 14 because of an election dispute in [New\nJersey](/wiki/New_Jersey \"New Jersey\") known as the \"[Broad Seal\nWar](/wiki/Broad_Seal_War \"Broad Seal War\")\". Two rival delegations, one\n[Whig](/wiki/Whig_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Whig Party \\(United States\\)\") and\nthe other Democrat, had been certified as elected by different branches of the\nNew Jersey government. The problem was compounded by the fact that the result\nof the dispute would determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the\nmajority. Neither party agreed to permit a speakership election with the\nopposite party's delegation participating. Finally, it was agreed to exclude\nboth delegations from the election and a Speaker was finally chosen on\nDecember 17.\n\nAnother, more prolonged fight occurred in 1855 in the [34th United States\nCongress](/wiki/34th_United_States_Congress \"34th United States Congress\").\nThe old [Whig Party](/wiki/Whig_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Whig Party \\(United\nStates\\)\") had collapsed but no single party had emerged to replace it.\nCandidates opposing the Democrats had run under a bewildering variety of\nlabels, including Whig, [Republican](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Republican Party \\(United States\\)\"), American ([Know\nNothing](/wiki/Know_Nothing \"Know Nothing\")), and simply\n\"[Opposition](/wiki/Opposition_Party_\\(Northern_U.S.\\) \"Opposition Party\n\\(Northern U.S.\\)\")\". By the time Congress actually met in December 1855, most\nof the northerners were concentrated together as Republicans, while most of\nthe southerners and a few northerners used the American or Know Nothing label.\nOpponents of the Democrats held a majority in House, with the party makeup of\nthe 234 Representatives being 83 Democrats, 108 Republicans, and 43 Know\nNothings (primarily southern oppositionists). The Democratic minority\nnominated [William Alexander Richardson](/wiki/William_Alexander_Richardson\n\"William Alexander Richardson\") of Illinois as Speaker, but because of\nsectional distrust, the various oppositionists were unable to agree on a\nsingle candidate for Speaker. The Republicans supported [Nathaniel Prentiss\nBanks](/wiki/Nathaniel_Prentiss_Banks \"Nathaniel Prentiss Banks\") of\nMassachusetts, who had been elected as a Know Nothing but was now largely\nidentified with the Republicans. The southern Know Nothings supported first\n[Humphrey Marshall](/wiki/Humphrey_Marshall_\\(general\\) \"Humphrey Marshall\n\\(general\\)\") of Kentucky, and then [Henry M. Fuller](/wiki/Henry_M._Fuller\n\"Henry M. Fuller\") of Pennsylvania. The voting went on for almost two months\nwith no candidate able to secure a majority, until it was finally agreed to\nelect the Speaker by plurality vote, and Banks was elected.[19] The House\nfound itself in a similar dilemma when the [36th\nCongress](/wiki/36th_United_States_Congress \"36th United States Congress\") met\nin December 1859. Although the Republicans held a plurality, the Republican\ncandidate, [John Sherman](/wiki/John_Sherman \"John Sherman\"), was unacceptable\nto southern oppositionists due to his anti-slavery views, and once again the\nHouse was unable to elect a Speaker for several months. After Democrats allied\nwith southern oppositionists to nearly elect the North Carolina oppositionist\n[William N. H. Smith](/wiki/William_N._H._Smith \"William N. H. Smith\"),\nSherman finally withdrew in favor of compromise candidate [William\nPennington](/wiki/William_Pennington \"William Pennington\") of New Jersey, a\nformer Whig of unclear partisan loyalties, who was finally elected Speaker at\nthe end of January 1860.[20]\n\nThe last speakership elections in which the House had to vote more than once\noccurred in the [65th](/wiki/65th_United_States_Congress \"65th United States\nCongress\") and [72nd United States Congress](/wiki/72nd_United_States_Congress\n\"72nd United States Congress\"). In 1917, neither the Republican nor the\nDemocratic candidate could attain a majority because three members of the\n[Progressive Party](/wiki/Progressive_Party_\\(United_States,_1912\\)\n\"Progressive Party \\(United States, 1912\\)\") and other individual members of\nother parties voted for their own party. The Republicans had a plurality in\nthe House but [James \"Champ\" Clark](/wiki/Champ_Clark \"Champ Clark\") remained\nSpeaker of the House because of the support of the Progressive Party members.\nIn 1931, both the Republicans and the Democrats had 217 members with the\n[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party](/wiki/Minnesota_Farmer-Labor_Party \"Minnesota\nFarmer-Labor Party\") having one member who served as the deciding vote. The\nFarmer-Labor Party eventually voted for the Democrats' candidate for Speaker,\n[John Nance Garner](/wiki/John_Nance_Garner \"John Nance Garner\"), who later\nbecame Vice President under [Franklin Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_Roosevelt\n\"Franklin Roosevelt\").\n\nIn 1997, several Republican congressional leaders tried to force Speaker [Newt\nGingrich](/wiki/Newt_Gingrich \"Newt Gingrich\") to resign. However, Gingrich\nrefused since that would have required a new election for Speaker, which could\nhave led to Democrats along with dissenting Republicans voting for Democrat\n[Dick Gephardt](/wiki/Dick_Gephardt \"Dick Gephardt\") (then Minority Leader) as\nSpeaker. After the 1998 midterm elections where the Republicans lost seats,\nGingrich did not stand for re-election. The next two figures in the House\nRepublican leadership hierarchy, Majority Leader [Richard\nArmey](/wiki/Richard_Armey \"Richard Armey\") and Majority Whip [Tom\nDeLay](/wiki/Tom_DeLay \"Tom DeLay\"), chose not to run for the office. The\nchairman of [the House Appropriations\nCommittee](/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Appropriations \"United\nStates House Committee on Appropriations\"), [Bob\nLivingston](/wiki/Bob_Livingston \"Bob Livingston\"), declared his bid for the\nspeakership, which was unopposed, making him Speaker-designate. It was then\nrevealed, by Livingston himself, who had been publicly critical of President\n[Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\")'s [perjury](/wiki/Perjury\n\"Perjury\") during his sexual harassment trial, that he had engaged in an\nextramarital affair. He opted to resign from the House, despite being urged to\nstay on by House Democratic leader Gephardt. Subsequently, chief deputy whip\n[Dennis Hastert](/wiki/Dennis_Hastert \"Dennis Hastert\") was selected as\nSpeaker. The Republicans retained their majorities in the 2000, 2002, and 2004\nelections.\n\nThe Democrats won a majority of seats in the 2006 midterm elections. On\nNovember 16, 2006, [Nancy Pelosi](/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi \"Nancy Pelosi\"), who was\nthen Minority Leader, was selected as Speaker-designate by House\nDemocrats.[21] When the 110th Congress convened on January 4, 2007, she was\nelected as the 52nd Speaker by a vote of 233-202, becoming the first woman\nelected Speaker of the House.[22] Pelosi remained Speaker through the 111th\nCongress. For the 112th Congress, Republican John Boehner was unanimously\ndesignated Speaker-designate by House Republicans and was elected the 53rd\nSpeaker of the House. As a show of dissent, nineteen Democratic\nrepresentatives voted for Democrats other than Pelosi, who had been chosen as\nHouse Minority Leader and the Democrats' candidate for Speaker.\n\n## Partisan\nrole[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Partisan role\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Speaker_Ryan_1.tif/lossy-\npage1-300px-Speaker_Ryan_1.tif.jpg)](/wiki/File:Speaker_Ryan_1.tif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Speaker_Ryan_1.tif \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe sitting Speaker, [Paul Ryan](/wiki/Paul_Ryan \"Paul Ryan\"), seen taking his\noath of office following his election on October 29, 2015\n\nThe Constitution does not spell out the political role of the Speaker. As the\noffice has developed historically, however, it has taken on a clearly partisan\ncast, very different from the speakership of most Westminster-style\nlegislatures, such as the [Speaker of the British House of\nCommons](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_\\(United_Kingdom\\) \"Speaker of\nthe House of Commons \\(United Kingdom\\)\"), which is meant to be scrupulously\nnon-partisan. The Speaker in the United States, by tradition, is the head of\nthe majority party in the House of Representatives, outranking the Majority\nLeader. However, despite having the right to vote, the Speaker usually does\nnot participate in debate and rarely votes.\n\nThe Speaker is responsible for ensuring that the House passes legislation\nsupported by the majority party. In pursuing this goal, the Speaker may use\ntheir power to determine when each bill reaches the floor. They also chair the\nmajority party's steering committee in the House. While the Speaker is the\nfunctioning head of the House majority party, the same is not true of the\nPresident _pro tempore_ of the Senate, whose office is primarily ceremonial\nand honorary.\n\nWhen the Speaker and the President belong to the same party, the Speaker tends\nto play the role in a more ceremonial light, as seen when [Dennis\nHastert](/wiki/Dennis_Hastert \"Dennis Hastert\") played a very low-key role\nduring the presidency of fellow Republican [George W.\nBush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W. Bush\"). Nevertheless, there are times\nwhen the Speaker plays a much larger role if the President is a fellow member\nof their party, and thus, the Speaker is tasked with pushing through the\nagenda of the majority party, often at the expense of the minority opposition.\nThis can be seen, most of all, in the speakership of [Democratic-\nRepublican](/wiki/Democratic-Republican \"Democratic-Republican\") [Henry\nClay](/wiki/Henry_Clay \"Henry Clay\"), who personally ensured the presidential\nvictory of fellow Democratic-Republican [John Quincy\nAdams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John Quincy Adams\"). Democrat [Sam\nRayburn](/wiki/Sam_Rayburn \"Sam Rayburn\") was a key player in the passing of\n[New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\") legislation under the presidency of\nfellow Democrat [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt\n\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt\"). Republican [Joseph Gurney\nCannon](/wiki/Joseph_Gurney_Cannon \"Joseph Gurney Cannon\") (under [Theodore\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore Roosevelt\")) was particularly\ninfamous for his marginalization of the minority Democrats and centralizing of\nauthority to the speakership. In more recent times, Speaker [Nancy\nPelosi](/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi \"Nancy Pelosi\") played a role in continuing the\npush for health care reform during the presidency of fellow Democrat [Barack\nObama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\").[23] The Republicans campaigned\nagainst Pelosi and the Democrats' legislation with their \"Fire Pelosi\" bus\ntour.[16]\n\nOn the other hand, when the Speaker and the President belong to opposite\nparties, the public role and influence of the Speaker tend to increase. As the\nhighest-ranking member of the opposition party (and _de facto_ Leader of the\nOpposition), the Speaker is normally the chief public opponent of the\nPresident's agenda. In this scenario, the Speaker is known for undercutting\nthe President's agenda by blocking measures by the minority party or rejecting\nbills by the Senate. One famous instance came in the form of [Thomas Brackett\nReed](/wiki/Thomas_Brackett_Reed \"Thomas Brackett Reed\") (under [Grover\nCleveland](/wiki/Grover_Cleveland \"Grover Cleveland\")), a Speaker notorious\nfor his successful attempt to force the Democrats to vote on measures where\nthe Republicans had clear majorities, which ensured that Cleveland's Democrats\nwere in no position to challenge the Republicans in the House. Joseph Cannon\nwas particularly unique in that he led the conservative \"Old Guard\" wing of\nthe Republican Party, while his President – Theodore Roosevelt – was of the\nmore progressive clique, and more than just marginalizing the Democrats,\nCannon used his power to punish the dissidents in his party and obstruct the\nprogressive wing of the Republican Party.\n\nMore modern examples include [Tip O'Neill](/wiki/Tip_O%27Neill \"Tip O'Neill\"),\nwho was a vocal opponent of President [Ronald Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan\n\"Ronald Reagan\")'s economic and defense policies; [Newt\nGingrich](/wiki/Newt_Gingrich \"Newt Gingrich\"), who fought a bitter battle\nwith President [Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\") for control\nof domestic policy; [Nancy Pelosi](/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi \"Nancy Pelosi\"), who\nargued with President [George W.

At other times, more junior\nmembers may be assigned to preside to give them experience with the rules and\nprocedures of the House. The Speaker may also designate, with approval of the\nHouse, a Speaker _pro tempore_ for special purposes, such as designating a\nRepresentative whose district is near Washington, D.C. to sign [enrolled\nbills](/wiki/Enrolled_bill \"Enrolled bill\") during long recesses.\n\nUnder the [Rules of the\nHouse](/wiki/Procedures_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Procedures of the United States House of Representatives\"), the Speaker, \"as\nsoon as practicable after the election of the Speaker and whenever appropriate\nthereafter,\" must deliver to the Clerk of the House a confidential list of\nMembers who are designated to act as Speaker in the case of a vacancy or\nphysical inability of the Speaker to perform their duties.[27]\n\nOn the floor of the House, the presiding officer is always addressed as\n\"Mister Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker,\" even if it is a Speaker _pro tempore_ ,\nand not the Speaker themselves. When the House resolves itself into a\n[Committee of the\nWhole](/wiki/Committee_of_the_Whole_\\(United_States_House_of_Representatives\\)\n\"Committee of the Whole \\(United States House of Representatives\\)\"), the\nSpeaker designates a member to preside over the Committee as the Chairman, who\nis addressed as \"Mister Chairman\" or \"Madam Chairwoman.\" To speak, members\nmust seek the presiding officer's recognition. The presiding officer also\nrules on all points of order but such rulings may be appealed to the whole\nHouse. The Speaker is responsible for maintaining decorum in the House and may\norder the [Sergeant-at-\nArms](/wiki/Sergeant_at_Arms_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives\") to enforce\nHouse rules.\n\nThe Speaker's powers and duties extend beyond presiding in the chamber. In\nparticular, the Speaker has great influence over the committee process. The\nSpeaker selects nine of the thirteen members of the powerful [Committee on\nRules](/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules \"United States House\nCommittee on Rules\"), subject to the approval of the entire majority party.\nThe leadership of the minority party chooses the remaining four members.\nFurthermore, the Speaker appoints all members of select committees and\nconference committees. Moreover, when a bill is introduced, the Speaker\ndetermines which committee will consider it. As a member of the House, the\nSpeaker is entitled to participate in debate and to vote but, by custom, only\ndoes so in exceptional circumstances. Ordinarily, the Speaker votes only when\nthe Speaker's vote would be decisive or on matters of great importance, such\nas constitutional amendments or major legislation.[28]\n\n## Other\nfunctions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Other functions\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/OFFICE_OF_THE_SPEAKER_OF_THE_HOUSE%2C_WASHINGTON_D.C..jpg/220px-\nOFFICE_OF_THE_SPEAKER_OF_THE_HOUSE%2C_WASHINGTON_D.C..jpg)](/wiki/File:OFFICE_OF_THE_SPEAKER_OF_THE_HOUSE,_WASHINGTON_D.C..jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:OFFICE_OF_THE_SPEAKER_OF_THE_HOUSE,_WASHINGTON_D.C..jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe speaker's office in the US Capitol, during the term of [Dennis\nHastert](/wiki/Dennis_Hastert \"Dennis Hastert\") (1999 to 2007)\n\nBecause joint sessions and joint meetings of Congress are held in the House\nchamber, the Speaker presides over joint sessions to hear addresses by the\nPresident, and joint meetings to hear addresses from foreign leaders or other\ninvited guests. However, the [Twelfth\nAmendment](/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twelfth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") and [3\nU.S.C.](/wiki/Title_3_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 3 of the United States\nCode\") [§ 15](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15) require that the\nPresident of the Senate preside over joint sessions of Congress assembled to\ncount [electoral votes](/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College \"United States\nElectoral College\") and to certify the results of a presidential election.\n\nThe Speaker is also responsible for overseeing the officers of the House: the\n[Clerk](/wiki/Clerk_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Clerk of\nthe United States House of Representatives\"), the [Sergeant-at-\nArms](/wiki/Sergeant-at-Arms_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Sergeant-at-Arms of the United States House of Representatives\"), the [Chief\nAdministrative\nOfficer](/wiki/Chief_Administrative_Officer_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Chief Administrative Officer of the United States House of Representatives\"),\nand the\n[Chaplain](/wiki/Chaplain_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives\").

The Speaker appoints the [House\nHistorian](/wiki/Historian_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Historian of the United States House of Representatives\") and the General\nCounsel and, jointly with the Majority and Minority Leaders, appoints the\n[House Inspector\nGeneral](/w/index.php?title=Inspector_General_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Inspector General of the United States House of Representatives \\(page does\nnot exist\\)\").\n\nThe Speaker is second in the [presidential line of\nsuccession](/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession \"United States\npresidential line of succession\"), immediately after the Vice President, under\nthe [Presidential Succession Act](/wiki/Presidential_Succession_Act\n\"Presidential Succession Act\") of 1947. The Speaker is followed in the line of\nsuccession by the President _pro tempore_ of the Senate and by the heads of\nfederal executive departments.\n\nTo date, the implementation of the Presidential Succession Act has never been\nnecessary and no Speaker has ever acted as President. Implementation of the\nlaw almost became necessary in 1973 after the resignation of Vice President\n[Spiro Agnew](/wiki/Spiro_Agnew \"Spiro Agnew\"). At the time, many believed\nthat President [Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\") would\nresign because of the [Watergate scandal](/wiki/Watergate_scandal \"Watergate\nscandal\"), allowing Speaker [Carl Albert](/wiki/Carl_Albert \"Carl Albert\") to\nsucceed to the Presidency. However, before he resigned, Nixon appointed\n[Gerald Ford](/wiki/Gerald_Ford \"Gerald Ford\") as Vice President in accordance\nwith the [Twenty-fifth Amendment](/wiki/Twenty-\nfifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-fifth Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution\"). Nevertheless, the United States government\ntakes the Speaker's place in the line of succession seriously enough that, for\nexample, following the [terrorist attacks of September 11,\n2001](/wiki/Terrorist_attacks_of_September_11,_2001 \"Terrorist attacks of\nSeptember 11, 2001\"), Speakers used military jets to fly back and forth to\ntheir districts and for other travel until Speaker Boehner discontinued the\npractice in 2011.
