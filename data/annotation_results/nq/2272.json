The term is also used figuratively to describe the state of\nawaiting execution (\"been on death row\"), even in places where no special\nfacility or separate unit for condemned inmates exists. After a person is\nfound guilty of a capital offense, the judge will give the jury the option of\nimposing a death sentence or life imprisonment without the possibility of\nparole. It is then up to a jury to decide whether to give the death sentence;\nthis usually has to be a unanimous decision. If the jury agrees on death, the\ndefendant will remain on death row during [appeal](/wiki/Appeal \"Appeal\") and\n[habeas corpus](/wiki/Habeas_corpus \"Habeas corpus\") procedures, which may\ncontinue for several years.\n\nOpponents of [capital punishment](/wiki/Capital_punishment \"Capital\npunishment\") claim that a prisoner's isolation and uncertainty over his or her\nfate constitute a form of [mental cruelty](/wiki/Mental_cruelty \"Mental\ncruelty\") and that especially long-time death row inmates are liable to become\n[mentally ill](/wiki/Mental_illness \"Mental illness\"), if they are not\nalready. This is referred to as the [death row\nphenomenon](/wiki/Death_row_phenomenon \"Death row phenomenon\"). In extreme\ncases some inmates may attempt to commit [suicide](/wiki/Suicide \"Suicide\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 United States\n    * 1.1 Death row locations in the United States\n  * 2 Other countries\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## United States[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Death_row&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: United States\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/USPTerreHaute.jpg)](/wiki/File:USPTerreHaute.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:USPTerreHaute.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[United States Penitentiary, Terre\nHaute](/wiki/United_States_Penitentiary,_Terre_Haute \"United States\nPenitentiary, Terre Haute\") houses the male death row prisoners sentenced by\nthe [U.S. federal government](/wiki/U.S._federal_government \"U.S. federal\ngovernment\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/SanQuentinSP.jpg/220px-\nSanQuentinSP.jpg)](/wiki/File:SanQuentinSP.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:SanQuentinSP.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[San Quentin State Prison](/wiki/San_Quentin_State_Prison \"San Quentin State\nPrison\") houses the male death row prisoners sentenced by the U.S. state of\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/PolunskyUnitWestLivingstonTX.jpg/220px-\nPolunskyUnitWestLivingstonTX.jpg)](/wiki/File:PolunskyUnitWestLivingstonTX.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PolunskyUnitWestLivingstonTX.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Allan B.

The time\nbetween sentencing and execution has increased relatively steadily between\n1977 and 2010, including a 22% jump between 1989 and 1990 and a similar jump\nbetween 2008 and 2009. In 2010, a death row inmate waited an average of 178\nmonths (roughly 15 years) between sentencing and execution.[1] Nearly a\nquarter of inmates on death row in the U.S. die of [natural\ncauses](/wiki/Death_by_natural_causes \"Death by natural causes\") while\nawaiting execution.[2]\n\nThere were 3,125 people on death row in the United States on January 1,\n2013.[3] Since 1977, the states of Texas (464), Virginia (108) and Oklahoma\n(94) have executed the most death row inmates.[1] As of 2010, California\n(683), Florida (390), Texas (330) and Pennsylvania (218) housed more than half\nof all inmates pending on death row. As of 2008, the longest-serving prisoner\non death row in the US who has been executed was [Jack\nAlderman](/wiki/Jack_Alderman \"Jack Alderman\") who served over 33 years. He\nwas executed in Georgia in 2008.[4] However, Alderman only holds the\ndistinction of being the longest-serving _executed_ inmate so far. A Florida\ninmate, Gary Alvord, arrived on Florida's death row in 1974. On April 9, 2013,\nAlvord had been on death row for exactly 39 years when he died on May 19, 2013\nfrom a brain tumor, having been longer on death row than any other United\nStates inmate.[5] The oldest prisoner on death row in the United States was\n[Leroy Nash](/wiki/Leroy_Nash \"Leroy Nash\"), age 94, in Arizona. He died of\n[natural causes](/wiki/Death_by_natural_causes \"Death by natural causes\") on\nFebruary 12, 2010.[6]\n\n### Death row locations in the United\nStates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Death_row&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Death row locations in the United States\")]\n\nSee also: [Capital punishment in the United\nStates](/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States \"Capital punishment in\nthe United States\")\n\n| Men's death row | Women's death row  \n---|---|---  \n**[Civilian Federal](/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_the_United_States_federal_government \"Capital punishment by the United States federal government\")** | [United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute](/wiki/United_States_Penitentiary,_Terre_Haute \"United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute\"), [Terre Haute](/wiki/Terre_Haute,_Indiana \"Terre Haute, Indiana\"), [Indiana](/wiki/Indiana \"Indiana\")[7] | [Federal Medical Center, Carswell](/wiki/Federal_Medical_Center,_Carswell \"Federal Medical Center, Carswell\"), [Fort Worth](/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas \"Fort Worth, Texas\"), [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\")[8][9][10]  \n**[Military](/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_the_United_States_military \"Capital punishment by the United States military\")** | [United States Disciplinary Barracks](/wiki/United_States_Disciplinary_Barracks \"United States Disciplinary Barracks\"), [Fort Leavenworth](/wiki/Fort_Leavenworth \"Fort Leavenworth\"), [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\") | [Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar](/wiki/Naval_Consolidated_Brig,_Miramar \"Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar\"), [San Diego](/wiki/San_Diego \"San Diego\"), [California](/wiki/California \"California\")**1**  \nState | Men's death row | Women's death row  \n---|---|---  \n**[Alabama](/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Alabama \"Capital punishment in Alabama\")** | [Holman Correctional Facility](/wiki/Holman_Correctional_Facility \"Holman Correctional Facility\"), [Atmore](/wiki/Atmore,_Alabama \"Atmore, Alabama\")[11] and [William E.
