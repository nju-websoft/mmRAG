He looks around\nas if looking for something that he expects to reveal itself in the shadows,\nthen a sudden commotion makes him pull the trigger. The gunfire awakens the\nchild and the man breaks down in tears. Later, Jessie and Mark Hobson adopt a\nnew foster child, eight-year-old Cody Morgan, after their young son Sean dies\nfrom accidentally drowning in the bathtub. They soon find out that Cody's\ndreams become reality, but his nightmares are quite deadly.\n\nOn his first night, the couple are amazed as multicolored butterflies flutter\nacross the living room, emitting a strong glow. Mark tries to capture a blue\nbutterfly to show to Cody, as the boy likes butterflies. However, Cody wakes\nup and the butterflies disappear. The following day at school, he befriends a\ngirl and antagonizes a mean kid. At home, Cody asks Mark who the child in the\npicture is, and Mark replies that he is their dead son, Sean. Cody answers\nthat his mom is dead, too. That night, the couple see their deceased child and\ntry to hug him. When Cody wakes up, Sean disappears. Upon discovering Cody's\ngift, Jessie takes advantage of it. She lets Cody watch home videos of Sean\nand, that night, the couple once again sees their beloved child. Days later,\nMark notices the addiction that his wife has found and accuses her of abusing\nCody for his gift instead of loving him. An argument ends with Mark taking\ndown the pictures of Sean.\n\nCody falls asleep at school, and a nightmarish creature that Cody calls \"the\nCanker Man\" appears before the mean kid, as the girl he's befriended watches\nin horror. Meanwhile, Jessie goes to a doctor and complains that her foster\nchild has trouble sleeping; the doctor prescribes medication. She mixes it\nwith his drink, unbeknownst to her husband. That night Sean once again appears\nbefore them but turns into a nightmare. Mark attempts to wake Cody up but can\nnot. Jessie confesses that she drugged the boy. The nightmare creature devours\nMark as Jessie is thrown across the room and falls unconscious. She wakes up\nwith Cody on the phone calling 911 for help. Suspecting domestic violence and\nthat the boy has been drugged, social services takes Cody away.\n\nJessie steals Cody's social worker's files and talks to the frightened former\nfoster parent of Cody. At the orphanage where Cody is kept, the staff have\nnoticed that Cody has not been sleeping for the past two days. That night, the\nboy is given a tranquilizer, which he protests against helplessly. Jessie\narrives to find the place dark and isolated. She witnesses nightmarish\ncreatures in every room. Finally, she finds where Cody is, but before she can\ngo near him, she is thrown across the hallway by the tall slender nightmare\ncreature. She pulls out a pillow shaped like a blue butterfly, and hugs the\ncreature. As she holds it, it takes the form of Cody and disappears. Before it\ndisappears, she whispers to him and asks him to release all the people the\ncreatures have taken. The nightmare turns into a beautiful dream, and all the\npeople taken by \"the Canker Man\" reappear, though only as dreams themselves.\nJessie takes the-still unconscious Cody home.\n\nThe following day, Jessie gives Cody the journal his birth mother Andrea had\nkept, which shows how much she had loved him and his gift. However, she had\ndied of pancreatic cancer when Cody was just three years old. Then she\nrevealed to him that there is more to his recurring nightmares than meets the\neye, and Cody begins to learn how to control his gift.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Before_I_Wake_\\(2016_film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Kate Bosworth](/wiki/Kate_Bosworth \"Kate Bosworth\") as Jessie Hobson\n  * [Thomas Jane](/wiki/Thomas_Jane \"Thomas Jane\") as Mark Hobson\n  * [Jacob Tremblay](/wiki/Jacob_Tremblay \"Jacob Tremblay\") as Cody Morgan\n  * [Annabeth Gish](/wiki/Annabeth_Gish \"Annabeth Gish\") as Natalie Friedman\n  * Topher Bousquet as The Canker Man\n  * [Dash Mihok](/wiki/Dash_Mihok \"Dash Mihok\") as Whelan Young\n  * [Jay Karnes](/wiki/Jay_Karnes \"Jay Karnes\") as Peter\n  * [Lance E.
