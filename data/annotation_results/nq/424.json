It is\nbased on the [conceptual](/wiki/Personality_type \"Personality type\") theory\nproposed by [Carl Jung](/wiki/Carl_Jung \"Carl Jung\"),[4] who had speculated\nthat humans experience the world using four principal psychological functions\n– sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking – and that one of these four\nfunctions is dominant for a person most of the time.[5]\n\nThe MBTI was constructed for normal populations and emphasizes the value of\nnaturally occurring differences.[6] \"The underlying assumption of the MBTI is\nthat we all have specific preferences in the way we construe our experiences,\nand these preferences underlie our interests, needs, values, and\nmotivation.\"[7]\n\nAlthough popular in the business sector, the MBTI exhibits significant\npsychometric deficiencies, notably including poor\n[validity](/wiki/Test_validity \"Test validity\") (i.e. not measuring what it\npurports to measure) and poor [reliability](/wiki/Reliability_\\(statistics\\)\n\"Reliability \\(statistics\\)\") (giving different results for the same person on\ndifferent occasions).[8][9][10] The four scales used in the MBTI have some\ncorrelation with four of the [Big Five personality\ntraits](/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits \"Big Five personality traits\"),\nwhich are a more commonly accepted framework.[11]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Origins of the theory\n    * 1.2 Differences from Jung\n      * 1.2.1 Structured vs. projective personality assessment\n      * 1.2.2 Judging vs. perception\n        * 1.2.2.1 Orientation of the tertiary function\n  * 2 Concepts\n    * 2.1 Type\n    * 2.2 Four dichotomies\n    * 2.3 Attitudes: extroversion/introversion\n    * 2.4 Functions: sensing/intuition and thinking/feeling\n      * 2.4.1 Dominant function\n    * 2.5 Lifestyle preferences: judging/perception\n  * 3 Format and administration\n    * 3.1 Additional formats\n    * 3.2 Translations into other languages\n  * 4 Precepts and ethics\n  * 5 Type dynamics and development\n  * 6 Cognitive learning styles\n    * 6.1 Extraversion/Introversion\n    * 6.2 Sensing/Intuition\n    * 6.3 Thinking/Feeling\n    * 6.4 Judging/Perceiving\n  * 7 Correlations with other instruments\n    * 7.1 Keirsey temperaments\n    * 7.2 Big Five\n    * 7.3 Personality disorders\n  * 8 Criticism\n    * 8.1 No evidence for dichotomies\n    * 8.2 Validity and utility\n    * 8.3 Lack of objectivity\n    * 8.4 Terminology\n    * 8.5 Factor analysis\n    * 8.6 Correlates\n    * 8.7 Reliability\n  * 9 Utility\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 Notes\n  * 12 References and further reading\n  * 13 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Art-\nmb2-300x0.jpeg/170px-Art-mb2-300x0.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Art-mb2-300x0.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Art-mb2-300x0.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Katharine Cook Briggs](/wiki/Katharine_Cook_Briggs \"Katharine Cook Briggs\")\nand [Isabel Briggs Myers](/wiki/Isabel_Briggs_Myers \"Isabel Briggs Myers\")\n[extrapolated](/wiki/Extrapolate \"Extrapolate\") their MBTI theory from [Carl\nJung](/wiki/Carl_Jung \"Carl Jung\")'s writings in his book _Psychological\nTypes_.\n\nKatharine Cook Briggs began her research into [personality](/wiki/Personality\n\"Personality\") in 1917. Upon meeting her future son-in-law, she observed\nmarked differences between his personality and that of other family members.\nBriggs embarked on a project of reading biographies, and subsequently\ndeveloped a typology wherein she proposed four temperaments: meditative (or\nthoughtful), spontaneous, executive, and social.[12][13]\n\nAfter the English translation of Jung's book _[Psychological\nTypes](/wiki/Psychological_Types \"Psychological Types\")_ was published in 1923\n(first published in German in 1921), she recognized that Jung's theory was\nsimilar to, but went far beyond, her own.[1]:22 Briggs's four types were later\nidentified as corresponding to the IXXXs, EXXPs, EXTJs and\nEXFJs.[_[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\n\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_][12][13] Her first publications were two articles\ndescribing Jung's theory, in the journal _New Republic_ in 1926 (\"Meet\nYourself Using the Personality Paint Box\") and 1928 (\"Up From Barbarism\").\nAfter extensively studying the work of Jung, they turned their interest in\nhuman behavior into efforts to turn the theory of psychological types to\npractical use.[2][12]\n\nBriggs's daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, added to her mother's typological\nresearch, which she would progressively take over entirely. Myers graduated\nfirst in her class from [Swarthmore College](/wiki/Swarthmore_College\n\"Swarthmore College\") in 1919[1]:xx and wrote a mystery novel, _Murder Yet to\nCome_ , in 1929 using typological ideas (which won the National Detective\nMurder Mystery Contest that year). However, neither Myers nor Briggs was\nformally educated in the discipline of psychology, and both were self-taught\nin the field of [psychometric testing](/wiki/Psychometric_testing\n\"Psychometric testing\").[1]:xiii Myers therefore apprenticed herself to\n[Edward N. Hay](/wiki/Edward_N._Hay \"Edward N. Hay\"), who was then personnel\nmanager for a large [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\") bank and\nwho went on to start one of the first successful personnel consulting firms in\nthe United States. From Hay, Myers learned rudimentary test construction,\nscoring, validation, and statistical methods.[1]:xiii, xx\n\nBriggs and Myers began creating the indicator during [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\")[2] in the belief that a knowledge of\npersonality preferences would help women who were entering the industrial\nworkforce for the first time to identify the sort of war-time jobs that would\nbe \"most comfortable and effective\" for them.[1]:xiii The _Briggs Myers Type\nIndicator Handbook_ was published in 1944. The indicator changed its name to\n\"Myers–Briggs Type Indicator\" in 1956.[14] Myers' work attracted the attention\nof Henry Chauncey, head of the [Educational Testing\nService](/wiki/Educational_Testing_Service \"Educational Testing Service\").\nUnder these auspices, the first MBTI _Manual_ was published in 1962. The MBTI\nreceived further support from Donald W. MacKinnon, head of the Institute of\nPersonality and Social Research at the [University of California,\nBerkeley](/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley \"University of California,\nBerkeley\"); W. Harold Grant, a professor at [Michigan State\nUniversity](/wiki/Michigan_State_University \"Michigan State University\") and\n[Auburn University](/wiki/Auburn_University \"Auburn University\"); and Mary H.\nMcCaulley of the [University of Florida](/wiki/University_of_Florida\n\"University of Florida\"). The publication of the MBTI was transferred to\nConsulting Psychologists Press in 1975, and the Center for Applications of\nPsychological Type was founded as a research laboratory.[1]:xxi\n\nAfter Myers' death in May 1980, Mary McCaulley updated the MBTI _Manual_ and\nthe second edition was published in 1985.[15] The third edition appeared in\n1998.\n\n### Origins of the\ntheory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Origins of the theory\")]\n\nJung's theory of psychological types was not based on controlled scientific\nstudies,[16] but instead on clinical observation,\n[introspection](/wiki/Introspection \"Introspection\"), and\n[anecdote](/wiki/Anecdote \"Anecdote\")—methods regarded as inconclusive in the\nmodern field of scientific psychology.[16]\n\nJung's typology theories postulated a sequence of four cognitive functions\n(thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition), each having one of two polar\norientations (extraversion or introversion), giving a total of eight dominant\nfunctions. The MBTI is based on these eight hypothetical functions, although\nwith some differences in expression from Jung's model (see [Differences from\nJung](/wiki/Jung_Type_Indicator \"Jung Type Indicator\") below). While the\nJungian model offers empirical evidence for the first three dichotomies,\nwhether the Briggs had evidence for the J-P preference is\nunclear.[_[verification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\n### Differences from\nJung[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Differences from Jung\")]\n\n#### Structured vs. projective personality\nassessment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Structured vs. projective personality assessment\")]\n\nThe MBTI takes what is called a \"structured\" approach to personality\nassessment. The responses to items are considered \"closed\" and interpreted\naccording to the theory of the test constructers in scoring. This is contrary\nto the \"projective\" approach to personality assessment advocated by\npsychodynamic theorists such as Carl Jung. Indeed, Jung was a proponent of the\n\"word association\" test as a measure of the unconscious dispositions\ninfluencing behavior. This approach uses \"open-ended\" responses that need to\nbe interpreted in the context of the \"whole\" person, and not according to the\npreconceived theory of the test constructers. Supporters of the projective\napproach to personality assessment are critical of the structured approach\nbecause defense mechanisms may distort responses to the closed items on\nstructured tests.\n\n#### Judging vs.\nperception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Judging vs. perception\")]\n\nThe most notable addition of Myers and Briggs ideas to Jung's original thought\nis their concept that a given type's fourth letter (J or P) indicates a\nperson's preferred extraverted function, which is the dominant function for\nextraverted types and the auxiliary function for introverted types.[1]:21–22\n\n##### Orientation of the tertiary\nfunction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Orientation of the tertiary function\")]\n\nJung theorized that the dominant function acts alone in its preferred world:\nexterior for extraverts and interior for introverts. The remaining three\nfunctions, he suggested, operate together in the opposite orientation. If the\ndominant cognitive function is introverted the other functions are extraverted\nand vice versa. The MBTI _Manual_ summarizes references in Jung's work to the\nbalance in psychological type as follows: \"There are several references in\nJung's writing to the three remaining functions having an opposite attitudinal\ncharacter. For example, in writing about introverts with thinking dominant ...\nJung commented that the counterbalancing functions have an extraverted\ncharacter.\"[15] However, many MBTI practitioners hold that the tertiary\nfunction is oriented in the same direction as the dominant function.[17] Using\nthe INTP type as an example, the orientation would be as follows:\n\n  * Dominant introverted thinking\n  * Auxiliary extraverted intuition\n  * Tertiary introverted sensing\n  * Inferior extraverted feeling\n\n##\nConcepts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Concepts\")]\n\nThe MBTI _Manual_ states that the indicator \"is designed to implement a\ntheory; therefore, the theory must be understood to understand the\nMBTI\".[18]:1 Fundamental to the MBTI is the [theory](/wiki/Theory \"Theory\") of\npsychological type as originally developed by Carl Jung.[1]:xiii Jung proposed\nthe existence of two dichotomous pairs of cognitive functions:\n\n  * The \"rational\" (judging) functions: thinking and feeling\n  * The \"irrational\" (perceiving) functions: sensation and intuition\n\nJung believed that for every person, each of the functions is expressed\nprimarily in either an [introverted or\nextraverted](/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion \"Extraversion and\nintroversion\") form.[1]:17 Based on Jung's original concepts, Briggs and Myers\ndeveloped their own theory of psychological type, described below, on which\nthe MBTI is based. However, although psychologist [Hans\nEysenck](/wiki/Hans_Eysenck \"Hans Eysenck\") called the MBTI a moderately\nsuccessful quantification of Jung's original principles as outlined in\n_Psychological Types_ ,[19] he also said, \"[The MBTI] creates 16 personality\ntypes which are said to be similar to Jung's theoretical concepts. I have\nalways found difficulties with this identification, which omits one half of\nJung's theory (he had 32 types, by asserting that for every conscious\ncombination of traits there was an opposite unconscious one). Obviously, the\nlatter half of his theory does not admit of questionnaire measurement, but to\nleave it out and pretend that the scales measure Jungian concepts is hardly\nfair to Jung.\"[20] In any event, both models remain hypothetical, with no\ncontrolled scientific studies supporting either Jung's original concept of\ntype or the Myers–Briggs variation.[16]\n\n###\nType[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Type\")]\n\nJung's typological model regards psychological type as similar to left or\nright [handedness](/wiki/Handedness \"Handedness\"): people are either born\nwith, or develop, certain preferred ways of perceiving and deciding. The MBTI\nsorts some of these psychological differences into four opposite pairs, or\n\"[dichotomies](/wiki/Dichotomy \"Dichotomy\")\", with a resulting 16 possible\npsychological types. None of these types is \"better\" or \"worse\"; however,\nBriggs and Myers theorized that people innately \"prefer\" one overall\ncombination of type differences.[1]:9 In the same way that writing with the\nleft hand is difficult for a right-hander, so people tend to find using their\nopposite psychological preferences more difficult, though they can become more\nproficient (and therefore behaviorally flexible) with practice and\ndevelopment.\n\nThe 16 types are typically referred to by an abbreviation of four letters—the\ninitial letters of each of their four type preferences (except in the case of\nintuition, which uses the abbreviation \"N\" to distinguish it from\nintroversion). For instance:\n\n  * **[ESTJ](/wiki/ESTJ \"ESTJ\")** : extraversion (E), sensing (S), thinking (T), judgment (J)\n  * **[INFP](/wiki/INFP \"INFP\")** : introversion (I), intuition (N), feeling (F), perception (P)\n\nThese abbreviations are applied to all 16 types.\n\n### Four\ndichotomies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Four dichotomies\")]\n\nCarl Jung | Subjective | Objective  \n---|---|---  \nPerception | Intuition/Sensing | Introversion/Extraversion 1  \nJudging | Feeling/Thinking | Introversion/Extraversion 2  \nMyers–Briggs | Subjective | Objective  \n---|---|---  \nDeductive | Intuition/Sensing | Introversion/Extraversion  \nInductive | Feeling/Thinking | Perception/Judging  \n  \nThe four pairs of preferences or \"dichotomies\" are shown in the adjacent\ntable.\n\nThe terms used for each dichotomy have specific technical meanings relating to\nthe MBTI, which differ from their everyday usage. For example, people who\nprefer judgment over perception are not necessarily more \"judgmental\" or less\n\"perceptive\", nor does the MBTI instrument measure [aptitude](/wiki/Aptitude\n\"Aptitude\"); it simply indicates for one preference over another.[18]:3\nSomeone reporting a high score for extraversion over introversion cannot be\ncorrectly described as more extraverted: they simply have a clear preference.\n\nPoint scores on each of the dichotomies can vary considerably from person to\nperson, even among those with the same type. However, Isabel Myers considered\nthe direction of the preference (for example, E vs. I) to be more important\nthan the degree of the preference (for example, very clear vs. slight).[15]\nThe expression of a person's psychological type is more than the sum of the\nfour individual preferences. The preferences interact through [type dynamics\nand type\ndevelopment](/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Type_dynamics_and_development\n\"Myers–Briggs Type Indicator\").\n\n### Attitudes:\nextroversion/introversion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Attitudes: extroversion/introversion\")]\n\nMyers–Briggs literature uses the terms extraversion and introversion as Jung\nfirst used them. Extraversion means literally outward-turning and\nintroversion, inward-turning.[21] These specific definitions differ somewhat\nfrom the popular usage of the words. Extraversion is the spelling used in MBTI\npublications.\n\nThe preferences for extraversion and introversion are often called\n\"[attitudes](/wiki/Attitude_\\(psychology\\) \"Attitude \\(psychology\\)\")\". Briggs\nand Myers recognized that each of the cognitive functions can operate in the\nexternal world of behavior, action, people, and things (\"extraverted\nattitude\") or the internal world of ideas and reflection (\"introverted\nattitude\"). The MBTI assessment sorts for an overall preference for one or the\nother.\n\nPeople who prefer extraversion draw energy from action: they tend to act, then\nreflect, then act further. If they are inactive, their motivation tends to\ndecline. To rebuild their energy, extraverts need breaks from time spent in\nreflection. Conversely, those who prefer introversion \"expend\" energy through\naction: they prefer to reflect, then act, then reflect again. To rebuild their\nenergy, introverts need quiet time alone, away from activity.[22]\n\nAn extravert's flow is directed outward toward people and objects, whereas the\nintrovert's is directed inward toward concepts and ideas. Contrasting\ncharacteristics between extraverted and introverted people include:\n\n  * Extraverted are action-oriented, while introverted are thought-oriented.\n  * Extraverted seek breadth of knowledge and influence, while introverted seek depth of knowledge and influence.\n  * Extraverted often prefer more frequent interaction, while introverted prefer more substantial interaction.\n  * Extraverted recharge and get their energy from spending time with people, while introverted recharge and get their energy from spending time alone; they consume their energy through the opposite process.[23]\n\n### Functions: sensing/intuition and\nthinking/feeling[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Functions: sensing/intuition and thinking/feeling\")]\n\nJung identified two pairs of psychological functions:\n\n  * Two perceiving functions: [sensation](/wiki/Sensation_\\(psychology\\) \"Sensation \\(psychology\\)\") (usually called sensing in MBTI writings) and [intuition](/wiki/Intuition_\\(psychology\\) \"Intuition \\(psychology\\)\")\n  * Two judging functions: thinking and feeling\n\nAccording to Jung's typology model, each person uses one of these four\nfunctions more dominantly and proficiently than the other three; however, all\nfour functions are used at different times depending on the circumstances.\n\nSensing and intuition are the information-gathering (perceiving) functions.\nThey describe how new information is understood and interpreted. People who\nprefer sensing are more likely to trust information that is in the present,\ntangible, and concrete: that is, information that can be understood by the\nfive senses. They tend to distrust hunches, which seem to come \"out of\nnowhere\".[1]:2 They prefer to look for details and facts. For them, the\nmeaning is in the data. On the other hand, those who prefer intuition tend to\ntrust information that is less dependent upon the senses, that can be\nassociated with other information (either remembered or discovered by seeking\na wider context or pattern). They may be more interested in future\npossibilities. For them, the meaning is in the underlying theory and\nprinciples which are manifested in the data.\n\nThinking and feeling are the [decision-making](/wiki/Decision-making\n\"Decision-making\") (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are\nboth used to make rational decisions, based on the data received from their\ninformation-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer\nthinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the\ndecision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a\ngiven set of rules. Those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by\nassociating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside'\nand weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony,\nconsensus and fit, considering the needs of the people involved. Thinkers\nusually have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or\nillogical, and tend to give very direct feedback to others. They are concerned\nwith the truth and view it as more important.\n\nAs noted already, people who prefer thinking do not necessarily, in the\neveryday sense, \"think better\" than their feeling counterparts, in the common\nsense; the opposite preference is considered an equally rational way of coming\nto decisions (and, in any case, the MBTI assessment is a measure of\npreference, not ability). Similarly, those who prefer feeling do not\nnecessarily have \"better\" emotional reactions than their thinking\ncounterparts. In many cases, however, people who use thinking functions as\neither dominant or auxiliary tend to have more underdeveloped feeling\nfunctions, and often have more trouble with regulating and making healthy and\nproductive decisions based on their feelings.\n\n#### Dominant\nfunction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Dominant function\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Cognitive_Functions.svg/220px-\nCognitive_Functions.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Cognitive_Functions.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cognitive_Functions.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA diagram depicting the cognitive functions of each type: A type's background\ncolor represents its dominant function and its text color represents its\nauxiliary function.\n\nAccording to Jung, people use all four cognitive functions. However, one\nfunction is generally used in a more conscious and confident way. This\ndominant function is supported by the secondary (auxiliary) function, and to a\nlesser degree the tertiary function. The fourth and least conscious function\nis always the opposite of the dominant function. Myers called this inferior\nfunction the \"shadow\".[1]:84\n\nThe four functions operate in conjunction with the attitudes (extraversion and\nintroversion). Each function is used in either an extraverted or introverted\nway. A person whose dominant function is extraverted intuition, for example,\nuses intuition very differently from someone whose dominant function is\nintroverted intuition.\n\n### Lifestyle preferences:\njudging/perception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Lifestyle preferences: judging/perception\")]\n\nMyers and Briggs added another dimension to Jung's typological model by\nidentifying that people also have a preference for using either the _judging_\nfunction (thinking or feeling) or their _perceiving_ function (sensing or\nintuition) when relating to the outside world (extraversion).\n\nMyers and Briggs held that types with a preference for judging show the world\ntheir preferred judging function (thinking or feeling). So, TJ types tend to\nappear to the world as logical and FJ types as [empathetic](/wiki/Empathetic\n\"Empathetic\"). According to Myers,[1]:75 judging types like to \"have matters\nsettled\".\n\nThose types who prefer perception show the world their preferred perceiving\nfunction (sensing or intuition). So, SP types tend to appear to the world as\nconcrete and NP types as abstract. According to Myers,[1]:75 perceptive types\nprefer to \"keep decisions open\".\n\nFor extraverts, the J or P indicates their dominant function; for introverts,\nthe J or P indicates their auxiliary function[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_].\nIntroverts tend to show their dominant function outwardly only in matters\n\"important to their inner worlds\".[1]:13 For example:\n\nBecause the ENTJ type is extraverted, the J indicates that the dominant\nfunction is the preferred judging function (extraverted thinking). The ENTJ\ntype introverts the auxiliary perceiving function (introverted intuition). The\ntertiary function is sensing and the inferior function is introverted feeling.\n\nBecause the INTJ type is introverted, however, the J instead indicates that\nthe auxiliary function is the preferred judging function (extraverted\nthinking). The INTJ type introverts the dominant perceiving function\n(introverted intuition). The tertiary function is feeling and the inferior\nfunction is extraverted sensing.\n\n## Format and\nadministration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Format and administration\")]\n\nThe current North American English version of the MBTI Step I includes 93\nforced-choice questions (88 are in the European English version). \"Forced-\nchoice\" means that a person has to choose only one of two possible answers to\neach question. The choices are a mixture of word pairs and short statements.\nChoices are not literal opposites, but chosen to reflect opposite preferences\non the same dichotomy. Participants may skip questions if they feel they are\nunable to choose.\n\nUsing psychometric techniques, such as [item response\ntheory](/wiki/Item_response_theory \"Item response theory\"), the MBTI will then\nbe scored and will attempt to identify the preference, and clarity of\npreference, in each dichotomy. After taking the MBTI, participants are usually\nasked to complete a \"Best Fit\" exercise (see below) and then given a readout\nof their Reported Type, which will usually include a bar graph and number\n(Preference Clarity Index) to show how clear they were about each preference\nwhen they completed the questionnaire.\n\nDuring the early development of the MBTI, thousands of items were used. Most\nwere eventually discarded because they did not have high \"midpoint\ndiscrimination\", meaning the results of that one item did not, on average,\nmove an individual score away from the midpoint. Using only items with high\nmidpoint discrimination allows the MBTI to have fewer items on it, but still\nprovide as much statistical information as other instruments with many more\nitems with lower midpoint discrimination.\n\n### Additional\nformats[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Additional formats\")]\n\nIsabel Myers had noted that people of any given type shared differences, as\nwell as similarities. At the time of her death, she was developing a more in-\ndepth method of measuring how people express and experience their individual\ntype pattern.\n\nIn 1987, an advanced scoring system was developed for the MBTI. From this was\ndeveloped the Type Differentiation Indicator (Saunders, 1989) which is a\nscoring system for the longer MBTI, _Form J_ ,[24] which includes the 290\nitems written by Myers that had survived her previous item analyses. It yields\n20 subscales (five under each of the four dichotomous preference scales), plus\nseven additional subscales for a new \"Comfort-Discomfort\" factor (which\npurportedly corresponds to the missing factor of neuroticism).\n\nThis factor's scales indicate a sense of overall comfort and confidence versus\ndiscomfort and anxiety. They also load onto one of the four type\ndimensions:[25] guarded-optimistic (also T/F), defiant-compliant (also T/F),\ncarefree-worried (also T/F), decisive-ambivalent (also J/P), intrepid-\ninhibited (Also E/I), leader-follower (Also E/I), and proactive-distractible\n(also J/P)\n\nAlso included is a composite of these called \"strain\". There are also scales\nfor type-scale consistency and comfort-scale consistency. Reliability of 23 of\nthe 27 TDI subscales is greater than 0.50, \"an acceptable result given the\nbrevity of the subscales\" (Saunders, 1989).\n\nIn 1989, a scoring system was developed for only the 20 subscales for the\noriginal four dichotomies. This was initially known as \"Form K\" or the\n\"Expanded Analysis Report\". This tool is now called the \"[MBTI Step\nII](/wiki/MBTI_Step_II \"MBTI Step II\")\".\n\nForm J or the TDI included the items (derived from Myers' and McCaulley's\nearlier work) necessary to score what became known as \"Step III\".[26] (The\n1998 _MBTI Manual_ reported that the two instruments were one and the\nsame[27]) It was developed in a joint project involving the following\norganizations: CPP, the publisher of the whole family of MBTI works; CAPT\n(Center for Applications of Psychological Type), which holds all of Myers' and\nMcCaulley's original work; and the MBTI Trust, headed by Katharine and Peter\nMyers. Step III was advertised as addressing type development and the use of\nperception and judgment by respondents.[28]\n\n### Translations into other\nlanguages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Translations into other languages\")]\n\nThe MBTI has been successfully translated and adapted into over 20\nlanguages,[29][30] including reviews by subject-matter experts fluent in the\nnative language, and statistical analysis to check that the questions still\nmeasure the same psychological concepts as the original US English\nquestionnaire.[31]\n\n## Precepts and\nethics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Precepts and ethics\")]\n\nThese precepts are generally used in the ethical administration of the MBTI:\n\nType not trait\n\n    The MBTI sorts for type; it does not indicate the strength of ability. It allows the clarity of a preference to be ascertained (Bill clearly prefers introversion), but not the strength of preference (Jane strongly prefers extraversion) or degree of aptitude (Harry is good at thinking). In this sense, it differs from trait-based tools such as [16PF](/wiki/16PF \"16PF\"). Type preferences are polar opposites: a precept of MBTI is that people fundamentally prefer one thing over the other, not a bit of both.\n\nOwn best judge\n\n    People are considered the best judge of their own type. While the MBTI provides a Reported Type, this is considered only an indication of their probable overall Type. A Best Fit Process is usually used to allow respondents to develop their understanding of the four dichotomies, to form their own hypothesis as to their overall Type, and to compare this against the Reported Type. In more than 20% of cases, the hypothesis and the Reported Type differ in one or more dichotomies. Using the clarity of each preference, any potential for bias in the report, and often, a comparison of two or more whole Types may then help respondents determine their own Best Fit.\n\nNo right or wrong\n\n    No preference or total type is considered better or worse than another. They are all '[Gifts Differing](/wiki/Gifts_Differing:_Understanding_Personality_Type \"Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type\")', as emphasized by the title of Isabel Briggs Myers' book on this subject.\n\nVoluntary\n\n    Compelling anyone to take the MBTI is considered unethical. It should always be taken voluntarily.[32]\n\nConfidentiality\n\n    The result of the MBTI Reported and Best Fit type are confidential between the individual and administrator, and ethically, not for disclosure without permission.\n\nNot for selection\n\n    The results of the assessment should not be used to \"**label** , evaluate, or limit the respondent in any way\" (emphasis original).[32] Since all types are valuable, and the MBTI measures preferences rather than aptitude, the MBTI is not considered a proper instrument for purposes of employment selection. Many professions contain highly competent individuals of different types with complementary preferences.\n\nImportance of proper feedback\n\n    People should always be given detailed feedback from a trained administrator and an opportunity to undertake a Best Fit exercise to check against their Reported Type. This feedback can be given in person, by telephone or electronically.\n\n## Type dynamics and\ndevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Type dynamics and development\")]\n\nThe Sixteen Types  \n---  \nUS Population Breakdown  \nThe table organizing the sixteen types was created by Isabel Myers (an INFP\nperson).  \n[ISTJ](/wiki/ISTJ \"ISTJ\")  \n11–14% | [ISFJ](/wiki/ISFJ \"ISFJ\")  \n9–14% | [INFJ](/wiki/INFJ \"INFJ\")  \n1–3% | [INTJ](/wiki/INTJ \"INTJ\")  \n2–4%  \n[ISTP](/wiki/ISTP_\\(personality_type\\) \"ISTP \\(personality type\\)\")  \n4–6% | [ISFP](/wiki/ISFP \"ISFP\")  \n5–9% | [INFP](/wiki/INFP \"INFP\")  \n4–5% | [INTP](/wiki/INTP \"INTP\")  \n3–5%  \n[ESTP](/wiki/ESTP \"ESTP\")  \n4–5% | [ESFP](/wiki/ESFP \"ESFP\")  \n4–9% | [ENFP](/wiki/ENFP \"ENFP\")  \n6–8% | [ENTP](/wiki/ENTP \"ENTP\")  \n2–5%  \n[ESTJ](/wiki/ESTJ \"ESTJ\")  \n8–12% | [ESFJ](/wiki/ESFJ \"ESFJ\")  \n9–13% | [ENFJ](/wiki/ENFJ \"ENFJ\")  \n2–5% | [ENTJ](/wiki/ENTJ \"ENTJ\")  \n2–5%  \nEstimated percentages of the 16 types in the United States population.[33]  \n  \nThe interaction of two, three, or four preferences is known as \"type\ndynamics\". Although type dynamics has received little or no empirical support\nto substantiate its viability as a [scientific theory](/wiki/Scientific_theory\n\"Scientific theory\"),[34] Myers and Briggs asserted that for each of the 16\nfour-preference types, one function is the most _dominant_ and is likely to be\nevident earliest in life. A secondary or auxiliary function typically becomes\nmore evident (differentiated) during teenaged years and provides balance to\nthe dominant. In normal development, individuals tend to become more fluent\nwith a third, tertiary function during mid-life, while the fourth, inferior\nfunction remains least consciously developed. The inferior function is often\nconsidered to be more associated with the unconscious, being most evident in\nsituations such as high stress (sometimes referred to as being \"in the grip\"\nof the inferior function).\n\nHowever, the use of type dynamics is disputed: in the conclusion of various\nstudies on the subject of type dynamics, James H. Reynierse writes, \"Type\ndynamics has persistent logical problems and is fundamentally based on a\nseries of category mistakes; it provides, at best, a limited and incomplete\naccount of type related phenomena\"; and \"type dynamics relies on anecdotal\nevidence, fails most efficacy tests, and does not fit the empirical facts\".\nHis studies gave the clear result that the descriptions and workings of type\ndynamics do not fit the real behavior of people. He suggests getting\ncompletely rid of type dynamics, because it does not help, but hinders\nunderstanding of personality. The presumed order of functions 1 to 4 did only\noccur in one out of 540 test results.[35]\n\nThe sequence of differentiation of dominant, auxiliary, and tertiary functions\nthrough life is termed _type development_. This is an idealized sequence that\nmay be disrupted by major life events.\n\nThe dynamic sequence of functions and their attitudes can be determined in the\nfollowing way:\n\n  * The overall _lifestyle preference_ (J-P) determines whether the judging (T-F) or perceiving (S-N) preference is most evident in the outside world; i.e., which function has an extraverted attitude\n  * The _attitude_ preference (E-I) determines whether the extraverted function is dominant or auxiliary\n  * For those with an overall preference for extraversion, the function with the _extraverted attitude_ will be the dominant function. For example, for an ESTJ type the dominant function is the judging function, thinking, and this is experienced with an extraverted attitude. This is notated as a dominant Te. For an ESTP, the dominant function is the perceiving function, sensing, notated as a dominant Se.\n  * The _auxiliary_ function for extraverts is the secondary preference of the judging or perceiving functions, and it is experienced with an introverted attitude: for example, the auxiliary function for ESTJ is introverted sensing (Si) and the auxiliary for ESTP is introverted thinking (Ti).\n  * For those with an overall preference for introversion, the function with the extraverted attitude is the _auxiliary_ ; the dominant is the other function in the main four letter preference. So the dominant function for ISTJ is introverted sensing (Si) with the auxiliary (supporting) function being extraverted thinking (Te).\n  * The _tertiary_ function is the opposite preference from the auxiliary. For example, if the Auxiliary is thinking then the Tertiary would be feeling. The attitude of the tertiary is the subject of some debate and therefore is not normally indicated; i.e. if the auxiliary was Te then the tertiary would be F (not Fe or Fi)\n  * The _inferior_ function is the opposite preference and attitude from the Dominant, so for an ESTJ with dominant Te the inferior would be Fi.\n\nNote that for extraverts, the dominant function is the one most evident in the\nexternal world. For introverts, however, it is the auxiliary function that is\nmost evident externally, as their dominant function relates to the interior\nworld.\n\nSome examples of whole types may clarify this further. Taking the ESTJ example\nabove:\n\n  * Extraverted function is a judging function (T-F) because of the overall J preference\n  * Extraverted function is dominant because of overall E preference\n  * Dominant function is therefore extraverted thinking (Te)\n  * Auxiliary function is the preferred perceiving function: introverted sensing (Si)\n  * Tertiary function is the opposite of the Auxiliary: intuition (N)\n  * Inferior function is the opposite of the Dominant: introverted feeling (Fi)\n\nThe dynamics of the ESTJ are found in the primary combination of extraverted\nthinking as their dominant function and introverted sensing as their auxiliary\nfunction: the dominant tendency of ESTJs to order their environment, to set\nclear boundaries, to clarify roles and timetables, and to direct the\nactivities around them is supported by their facility for using past\nexperience in an ordered and systematic way to help organize themselves and\nothers. For instance, ESTJs may enjoy planning trips for groups of people to\nachieve some goal or to perform some culturally uplifting function. Because of\ntheir ease in directing others and their facility in managing their own time,\nthey engage all the resources at their disposal to achieve their goals.\nHowever, under prolonged stress or sudden trauma, ESTJs may overuse their\nextraverted thinking function and fall into the grip of their inferior\nfunction, introverted feeling. Although the ESTJ can seem insensitive to the\nfeelings of others in their normal activities, under tremendous stress, they\ncan suddenly express feelings of being unappreciated or wounded by\ninsensitivity.\n\nLooking at the diametrically opposite four-letter type, _INFP_ :\n\n  * Extraverted function is a perceiving function (S-N) because of the P preference\n  * Introverted function is dominant because of the I preference\n  * Dominant function is therefore introverted feeling (Fi)\n  * Auxiliary function is extraverted intuition (Ne)\n  * Tertiary function is the opposite of the Auxiliary: sensing (S)\n  * Inferior function is the opposite of the Dominant: extraverted thinking (Te)\n\nThe dynamics of the INFP rest on the fundamental correspondence of introverted\nfeeling and extraverted intuition. The dominant tendency of the INFP is toward\nbuilding a rich internal framework of values and toward championing human\nrights. They often devote themselves behind the scenes to causes such as civil\nrights or saving the environment. Since they tend to avoid the limelight,\npostpone decisions, and maintain a reserved posture, they are rarely found in\nexecutive-director-type positions of the organizations that serve those\ncauses. Normally, the INFP dislikes being \"in charge\" of things. When not\nunder stress, the INFP radiates a pleasant and sympathetic demeanor, but under\nextreme stress, they can suddenly become rigid and directive, exerting their\nextraverted thinking erratically.\n\nEvery type, and its opposite, is the expression of these interactions, which\ngive each type its unique, recognizable _signature_.\n\n## Cognitive learning\nstyles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Cognitive learning styles\")]\n\nThe test is scored by evaluating each answer in terms of what it reveals about\nthe taker. Each question is relevant to one of the following cognitive\nlearning styles. Each is not a polar opposite, but a gradual continuum.\n\n###\nExtraversion/Introversion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Extraversion/Introversion\")]\n\nThe extraverted types learn best by talking and interacting with others. By\ninteracting with the physical world, extraverts can process and make sense of\nnew information. The introverted types prefer quiet reflection and privacy.\nInformation processing occurs for introverts as they explore ideas and\nconcepts internally.\n\n###\nSensing/Intuition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Sensing/Intuition\")]\n\nThe second continuum reflects what people focus their attentions on. Sensing\ntypes enjoy a learning environment in which the material is presented in a\ndetailed and sequential manner. Sensing types often attend to what is\noccurring in the present, and can move to the abstract after they have\nestablished a concrete experience. Intuitive types prefer a learning\natmosphere in which an emphasis is placed on meaning and associations. Insight\nis valued higher than careful observation, and pattern recognition occurs\nnaturally for intuitive types.\n\n###\nThinking/Feeling[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Thinking/Feeling\")]\n\nThe third continuum reflects a person's decision preferences. Thinking types\ndesire objective truth and logical principles and are natural at deductive\nreasoning. Feeling types place an emphasis on issues and causes that can be\npersonalized while they consider other people's motives.\n\n###\nJudging/Perceiving[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Judging/Perceiving\")]\n\nThe fourth continuum reflects how a person regards complexity. Judging types\nwill thrive when information is organized and structured, and they will be\nmotivated to complete assignments in order to gain closure. Perceiving types\nwill flourish in a flexible learning environment in which they are stimulated\nby new and exciting ideas. Judging types like to be on time, while perceiving\ntypes may be late and/or procrastinate.\n\n## Correlations with other\ninstruments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Correlations with other instruments\")]\n\n### Keirsey\ntemperaments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Keirsey temperaments\")]\n\n[David W.

Emotional stability (or\n[neuroticism](/wiki/Neuroticism \"Neuroticism\")) is a predictor of depression\nand anxiety disorders. These correlations refer to the second letter shown,\ni.e., the table shows that I and P have negative correlations with\nextraversion and conscientiousness, respectively, while F and N have positive\ncorrelations with agreeableness and openness, respectively.\n\nThese findings led McCrae and Costa to conclude that, \"correlational analyses\nshowed that the four MBTI indices did measure aspects of four of the five\nmajor dimensions of normal personality. The five-factor model provides an\nalternative basis for interpreting MBTI findings within a broader, more\ncommonly shared conceptual framework.\" However, \"there was no support for the\nview that the MBTI measures truly dichotomous preferences or qualitatively\ndistinct types, instead, the instrument measures four relatively independent\ndimensions.\"[37]\n\n### Personality\ndisorders[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Personality disorders\")]\n\nOne study found [personality disorders](/wiki/Personality_disorder\n\"Personality disorder\") as described by the\n[DSM](/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders \"Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\") overall to correlate modestly\nwith I, N, T, and P, although the associations varied significantly by\ndisorder.

Indeed, given the mixed quality of research and the\ninconsistent findings, no definitive conclusion regarding these relationships\ncan be drawn.\"[9][43]\n\nPsychometric specialist [Robert Hogan](/wiki/Robert_Hogan_\\(psychologist\\)\n\"Robert Hogan \\(psychologist\\)\") wrote: \"Most personality psychologists regard\nthe MBTI as little more than an elaborate Chinese fortune cookie ...\"[44]\n\n### No evidence for\ndichotomies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: No evidence for dichotomies\")]\n\nAs described in the § Four dichotomies section, Isabel Myers considered the\ndirection of the preference (for example, E vs. I) to be more important than\nthe degree of the preference. Statistically, this would mean that scores on\neach MBTI scale would show a [bimodal distribution](/wiki/Bimodal_distribution\n\"Bimodal distribution\") with most people scoring near the ends of the scales,\nthus dividing people into either, e.g., an extroverted or an introverted\npsychological type. However, most studies have found that scores on the\nindividual scales were actually distributed in a centrally peaked manner,\nsimilar to a [normal distribution](/wiki/Normal_distribution \"Normal\ndistribution\"), indicating that the majority of people were actually in the\nmiddle of the scale and were thus neither clearly introverted nor extroverted.\nMost personality traits do show a normal distribution of scores from low to\nhigh, with about 15% of people at the low end, about 15% at the high end and\nthe majority of people in the middle ranges. But in order for the MBTI to be\nscored, a cut-off line is used at the middle of each scale and all those\nscoring below the line are classified as a low type and those scoring above\nthe line are given the opposite type. Thus, psychometric assessment research\nfails to support the concept of _type_ , but rather shows that most people lie\nnear the middle of a continuous curve.[8][37][45][46][47] \"Although we do not\nconclude that the absence of bimodality necessarily proves that the MBTI\ndevelopers' theory-based assumption of categorical \"types\" of personality is\ninvalid, the absence of empirical bimodality in [IRT-\nbased](/wiki/Item_response_theory \"Item response theory\") research of MBTI\nscores does indeed remove a potentially powerful line of evidence that was\npreviously available to \"type\" advocates to cite in defense of their\nposition.\"[47]\n\n### Validity and\nutility[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Validity and utility\")]\n\nThe content of the MBTI scales is problematic. In 1991, a [National Academy of\nSciences](/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences \"United States\nNational Academy of Sciences\") committee reviewed data from MBTI research\nstudies and concluded that only the I-E scale has high correlations with\ncomparable scales of other instruments and low correlations with instruments\ndesigned to assess different concepts, showing strong validity. In contrast,\nthe S-N and T-F scales show relatively weak validity. The 1991 review\ncommittee concluded at the time there was \"not sufficient, well-designed\nresearch to justify the use of the MBTI in career counseling programs\".[48]\nThis study based its measurement of validity on \"criterion-related validity\n(i.e., does the MBTI predict specific outcomes related to interpersonal\nrelations or career success/job performance?).\"[48] There is insufficient\nevidence to make claims about utility, particularly of the four letter type\nderived from a person's responses to the MBTI items.[8]\n\n### Lack of\nobjectivity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Lack of objectivity\")]\n\nThe accuracy of the MBTI depends on honest self-reporting.[18]:52–53 Unlike\nsome personality questionnaires, such as the [16PF\nQuestionnaire](/wiki/16PF_Questionnaire \"16PF Questionnaire\"), the [Minnesota\nMultiphasic Personality\nInventory](/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory \"Minnesota\nMultiphasic Personality Inventory\"), or the [Personality Assessment\nInventory](/wiki/Personality_Assessment_Inventory \"Personality Assessment\nInventory\"), the MBTI does not use validity scales to assess exaggerated or\nsocially desirable responses.[10] As a result, individuals motivated to do so\ncan fake their responses,[49] and one study found that the MBTI\njudgment/perception dimension correlates weakly with the [Eysenck Personality\nQuestionnaire](/wiki/Eysenck_Personality_Questionnaire \"Eysenck Personality\nQuestionnaire\") lie scale.[50] If respondents \"fear they have something to\nlose, they may answer as they assume they _should_.\"[18]:53 However, the MBTI\nethical guidelines state, \"It is unethical and in many cases illegal to\nrequire job applicants to take the Indicator if the results will be used to\nscreen out applicants.\"[32] The intent of the MBTI is to provide \"a framework\nfor understanding individual differences, and ... a dynamic model of\nindividual development\".[51]\n\n###\nTerminology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Terminology\")]\n\nThe terminology of the MBTI has been criticized as being very \"vague and\ngeneral\",[52] so as to allow any kind of behavior to fit any personality type,\nwhich may result in the [Forer effect](/wiki/Forer_effect \"Forer effect\"),\nwhere people give a high rating to a positive description that supposedly\napplies specifically to them.[8][16] Others argue that while the MBTI type\ndescriptions are brief, they are also distinctive and precise.[53]:14–15 Some\ntheorists, such as David Keirsey, have expanded on the MBTI descriptions,\nproviding even greater detail. For instance, Keirsey's descriptions of his\n[four temperaments](/wiki/Keirsey_Temperament_Sorter#Four_temperaments\n\"Keirsey Temperament Sorter\"), which he correlated with the sixteen MBTI\npersonality types, show how the temperaments differ in terms of language use,\nintellectual orientation, educational and vocational interests, social\norientation, self-image, personal values, social roles, and characteristic\nhand gestures.[53]:32–207\n\n### Factor\nanalysis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Factor analysis\")]\n\nResearchers have reported that the JP and the SN scales correlate with one\nanother.[37] One factor-analytic study based on (N=1291) college-aged students\nfound six different factors instead of the four purported dimensions, thereby\nraising doubts as to the [construct validity](/wiki/Construct_validity\n\"Construct validity\") of the MBTI.[54]\n\n###\nCorrelates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Correlates\")]\n\nAccording to Hans Eysenck: \"The main dimension in the MBTI is called E-I, or\nextraversion-introversion; this is mostly a sociability scale, correlating\nquite well with the MMPI social introversion scale (negatively) and the\nEysenck Extraversion scale (positively).[55] Unfortunately, the scale also has\na loading on neuroticism, which correlates with the introverted end. Thus\nintroversion correlates roughly (i.e. averaging values for males and females)\n-.44 with dominance, -.24 with aggression, +.37 with abasement, +.46 with\ncounselling readiness, -.52 with self-confidence, -.36 with personal\nadjustment, and -.45 with empathy. The failure of the scale to disentangle\nIntroversion and Neuroticism (there is no scale for neurotic and other\npsychopathological attributes in the MBTI) is its worst feature, only equalled\nby the failure to use factor analysis in order to test the arrangement of\nitems in the scale.\"[19]\n\n###\nReliability[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: Reliability\")]\n\nThe test-retest [reliability](/wiki/Reliability_\\(statistics\\) \"Reliability\n\\(statistics\\)\") of the MBTI tends to be low. Large numbers of people (between\n39% and 76% of respondents) obtain different type classifications when\nretaking the indicator after only five weeks.[8][46][56] In _[Fortune\nMagazine](/wiki/Fortune_Magazine \"Fortune Magazine\")_ (May 15, 2013), an\narticle titled \"Have we all been duped by the Myers-Briggs Test\" stated:\n\n“ | The interesting – and somewhat alarming – fact about the MBTI is that, despite its popularity, it has been subject to sustained criticism by professional psychologists for over three decades. One problem is that it displays what statisticians call low \"test-retest reliability.\" So if you retake the test after only a five-week gap, there's around a 50% chance that you will fall into a different personality category compared to the first time you took the test.  \nA second criticism is that the MBTI mistakenly assumes that personality falls into mutually exclusive categories. ... The consequence is that the scores of two people labelled \"introverted\" and \"extroverted\" may be almost exactly the same, but they could be placed into different categories since they fall on either side of an imaginary dividing line.[57] | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \nWithin each _dichotomy_ scale, as measured on Form G, about 83% of\ncategorizations remain the same when people are retested within nine months\nand around 75% when retested after nine months. About 50% of people re-\nadministered the MBTI within nine months remain the same overall _type_ and\n36% the same type after more than nine months.[58] For Form M (the most\ncurrent form of the MBTI instrument), the MBTI _Manual_ reports that these\nscores are higher (p. 163, Table 8.6).\n\nIn one study, when people were asked to compare their preferred type to that\nassigned by the MBTI assessment, only half of people chose the same\nprofile.[59]\n\nIt has been argued that criticisms regarding the MBTI mostly come down to\nquestions regarding the validity of its origins, not questions regarding the\nvalidity of the MBTI's usefulness.[60] Others argue that the MBTI can be a\nreliable measurement of personality; it just so happens that \"like all\nmeasures, the MBTI yields scores that are dependent on sample characteristics\nand testing conditions\".[61]\n\n##\nUtility[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=36\n\"Edit section: Utility\")]\n\nIsabel Myers claimed that the proportion of different personality types varied\nby choice of career or course of study.[1]:40–51[15] However, researchers\nexamining the proportions of each type within varying professions report that\nthe proportion of MBTI types within each occupation is close to that within a\nrandom sample of the population.[8] Some researchers have expressed\nreservations about the relevance of type to job satisfaction, as well as\nconcerns about the potential misuse of the instrument in labeling\npeople.[8][62]\n\nCPP became the exclusive publisher of the MBTI in 1975. They call it \"the\nworld's most widely used personality assessment\", with as many as two million\nassessments administered annually.[63] CPP and other proponents state that the\nindicator meets or exceeds the reliability of other psychological instruments\nand cite reports of individual behavior.[64][46][65][_[excessive\ncitations](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Bundling_citations \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\")_]\n\nAlthough meta-analysis claim support for validity and reliability,[66][67]\nstudies suggest that the MBTI \"lacks convincing validity data\" and that it is\npseudoscience.[8][37][45][46][68][69]\n\nThe MBTI is not a useful predictor of job performance.[8][48][70] As noted\nabove under Precepts and ethics, the MBTI measures preferences, not ability.\nThe use of the MBTI as a predictor of job success is expressly discouraged in\nthe _Manual_.[18]:78 However, the MBTI continues to be popular because many\npeople lack psychometric sophistication, it is not difficult to understand,\nand there are many supporting books, websites and other sources which are\nreadily available to the general public.[71]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=37\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/28px-Psi2.svg.png)[Psychology portal](/wiki/Portal:Psychology \"Portal:Psychology\")\n\nCriticism\n\n  * [Labeling theory](/wiki/Labeling_theory \"Labeling theory\")\n  * [Cold reading](/wiki/Cold_reading \"Cold reading\")\n  * [Barnum effect](/wiki/Barnum_effect \"Barnum effect\")\n  * [Aura (paranormal)](/wiki/Aura_\\(paranormal\\) \"Aura \\(paranormal\\)\")\n\nOthers\n\n  * [Adjective Check List](/wiki/Adjective_Check_List \"Adjective Check List\") (ACL)\n  * [Brain types](/wiki/Brain_types \"Brain types\")\n  * [DISC assessment](/wiki/DISC_assessment \"DISC assessment\")\n  * [Enneagram of Personality](/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality \"Enneagram of Personality\")\n  * [Riso–Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator](/wiki/Riso%E2%80%93Hudson_Enneagram_Type_Indicator \"Riso–Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator\")\n  * [FIRO-B](/wiki/FIRO-B \"FIRO-B\")\n  * [Forte Communication Style Profile](/wiki/Forte_Communication_Style_Profile \"Forte Communication Style Profile\")\n  * [The Highlands Ability Battery](/w/index.php?title=The_Highlands_Ability_Battery&action=edit&redlink=1 \"The Highlands Ability Battery \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n  * [Holland Codes](/wiki/Holland_Codes \"Holland Codes\")\n  * [Humorism](/wiki/Humorism \"Humorism\")\n  * [Interaction Styles](/wiki/Interaction_Styles \"Interaction Styles\")\n  * [Interpersonal compatibility](/wiki/Interpersonal_compatibility \"Interpersonal compatibility\")\n  * [Jungian Type Index](/wiki/Jungian_Type_Index \"Jungian Type Index\")\n  * [List of tests § Personality tests](/wiki/List_of_tests#Personality_tests \"List of tests\")\n  * [Organizational culture § Kim Cameron and Robert Quinn](/wiki/Organizational_culture#Kim_Cameron_and_Robert_Quinn \"Organizational culture\")\n  * [Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator (PMAI)](/w/index.php?title=Pearson-Marr_Archetype_Indicator_\\(PMAI\\)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator \\(PMAI\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n  * [Personality Assessment System](/wiki/Personality_Assessment_System \"Personality Assessment System\")\n  * [Personality clash](/wiki/Personality_clash \"Personality clash\")\n  * [Personality psychology](/wiki/Personality_psychology \"Personality psychology\")\n  * [Revised NEO Personality Inventory](/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory \"Revised NEO Personality Inventory\")\n  * [Roger Birkman § The Birkman Method](/wiki/Roger_Birkman#The_Birkman_Method \"Roger Birkman\")\n  * [Socionics](/wiki/Socionics \"Socionics\"), a sister theory[72]\n  * [Strong Interest Inventory](/wiki/Strong_Interest_Inventory \"Strong Interest Inventory\")\n  * [Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument](/wiki/Thomas_Kilmann_Conflict_Mode_Instrument \"Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument\")\n  * [Two-factor models of personality § Factors integrated into modern instruments](/wiki/Two-factor_models_of_personality#Factors_integrated_into_modern_instruments \"Two-factor models of personality\") (CPI 260)\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator&action=edit&section=38\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ _**h**_ _**i**_ _**j**_ _**k**_ _**l**_ _**m**_ _**n**_ _**o**_ _**p**_ _**q**_ Myers, Isabel Briggs with Peter B.
