        "# Matthew 5:30\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**Matthew 5:30** is the thirtieth verse of the fifth chapter of the [Gospel of\nMatthew](/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew \"Gospel of Matthew\") in the [New\nTestament](/wiki/New_Testament \"New Testament\") and is part of the [Sermon on\nthe Mount](/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mount \"Sermon on the Mount\"). Part of the\nsection on [adultery](/wiki/Adultery \"Adultery\"), it is very similar to the\nprevious verse, but with the [hand](/wiki/Hand \"Hand\") mentioned instead of\nthe [eye](/wiki/Human_eye \"Human eye\"). For a discussion of the radicalism of\nthese verses see [Matthew 5:29](/wiki/Matthew_5:29 \"Matthew 5:29\").\n[Jesus](/wiki/Jesus \"Jesus\") had stated that looking at a [woman](/wiki/Woman\n\"Woman\") in [lust](/wiki/Lust \"Lust\") is equal to the act of adultery itself\nand in this verse he recommends cutting off one's hand to prevent\n[sinning](/wiki/Sin \"Sin\").\n\nIn the [King James Version](/wiki/King_James_Version \"King James Version\") of\nthe Bible the text reads:\n\n    And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and\n    cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee\n    that one of thy members should perish, and not\n    that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\n\nThe [World English Bible](/wiki/World_English_Bible \"World English Bible\")\ntranslates the passage as:\n\n    If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off,\n    and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable\n    for you that one of your members should perish, than\n    for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.\n\nFor a collection of other versions see [BibRef Matthew\n5:30](http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&verse=5:30&src=!)\n\nThe link between the right hand and the discussion of adultery is somewhat\nunclear. In Jewish writings of the time it was common to have a foot, hand,\neye triple structure. This full triple structure is seen in the similar\ndiscussions at [Mark 9:43](/w/index.php?title=Mark_9:43&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Mark 9:43 \\(page does not\nexist\\)\")-[47](/w/index.php?title=Mark_9:47&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Mark 9:47\n\\(page does not exist\\)\"), and a version much closer to that in Mark appears\nat [Matthew 18:8](/wiki/Matthew_18:8 \"Matthew 18:8\")-[9](/wiki/Matthew_18:9\n\"Matthew 18:9\"). Jesus here uses two thirds of the structure, the first\nreference to the eye is clearly linked to his previous statement that looking\nat a woman lustfully is sinful, but it is uncertain why he continues to the\nhand when he specifically stated that action and touching is not required for\nsin. Hill feels that this might be related to [theft](/wiki/Theft \"Theft\"). At\nthe time the law saw adultery as a form of theft, as it was taking another\nman's wife. The right hand, the more active of the two among most of the\npopulation, had long been metaphorically associated with theft. An alternate\nview, that has been adopted by some in recent years, is that the mention of a\nhand linked to lust is a reference to [masturbation](/wiki/Masturbation\n\"Masturbation\"). In the New Testament this is the verse most often cited to\ncondemn that practice. A third view is to see this verse connected less to the\nprevious verses, and more as part of the discussion of [divorce](/wiki/Divorce\n\"Divorce\") that takes up the next two verses. This argument states that the\ncutting off of the sinful hand is a metaphor for separation from a sinful\nspouse, even if it causes great pain.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Matthew_5:30&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  * France, R.T. _The Gospel According to Matthew: an Introduction and Commentary._ Leicester: Inter-Varsity, 1985.\n  * [Gundry, Robert H.](/wiki/Robert_H._Gundry \"Robert H.
