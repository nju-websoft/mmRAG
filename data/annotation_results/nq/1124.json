It was fought\nin an area between the cities of [Poitiers](/wiki/Poitiers \"Poitiers\") and\n[Tours](/wiki/Tours \"Tours\"), in the [Aquitaine](/wiki/Aquitaine \"Aquitaine\")\nof west-central France, near the village of [Moussais-la-\nBataille](/wiki/Moussais-la-Bataille \"Moussais-la-Bataille\"), about 20\nkilometres (12 mi) northeast of Poitiers. The location of the battle was close\nto the border between the [Frankish realm](/wiki/Francia \"Francia\") and the\nthen-independent [Duchy of Aquitaine](/wiki/Duchy_of_Aquitaine \"Duchy of\nAquitaine\") under [Odo the Great](/wiki/Odo_the_Great \"Odo the Great\").\n\nThe Franks were victorious. 'Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi was killed, and Charles\nsubsequently extended his authority in the south. Details of the battle,\nincluding its exact location and the number of combatants, cannot be\ndetermined from accounts that have survived. Notably, the Frankish troops won\nthe battle without cavalry.[22]\n\nNinth-century chroniclers, who interpreted the outcome of the battle as divine\njudgment in his favour, gave Charles the nickname _Martellus_ (\"The Hammer\").\nLater Christian chroniclers and pre-20th century historians praised Charles\nMartel as the champion of Christianity, characterizing the battle as the\ndecisive turning point in the struggle against Islam, a struggle which\npreserved Christianity as the religion of Europe; according to modern military\nhistorian [Victor Davis Hanson](/wiki/Victor_Davis_Hanson \"Victor Davis\nHanson\"), \"most of the 18th and 19th century historians, like Gibbon, saw\nPoitiers (Tours), as a landmark battle that marked the high tide of the Muslim\nadvance into Europe.\"[23] [Leopold von Ranke](/wiki/Leopold_von_Ranke \"Leopold\nvon Ranke\") felt that \"Poitiers was the turning point of one of the most\nimportant epochs in the history of the world.\"[24]\n\nThere is little dispute that the battle helped lay the foundations of the\n[Carolingian Empire](/wiki/Carolingian_Empire \"Carolingian Empire\") and\nFrankish domination of Europe for the next century. Most historians agree that\n\"the establishment of Frankish power in western Europe shaped that continent's\ndestiny and the Battle of Tours confirmed that power.\"[25]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n    * 1.1 Moors\n    * 1.2 Franks\n    * 1.3 Muslim conquests from Hispania\n    * 1.4 Odo's appeal to the Franks\n    * 1.5 Umayyad advance towards the Loire\n  * 2 Battle (October 732)\n    * 2.1 Preparations and maneuver\n    * 2.2 Engagement\n    * 2.3 Turning point\n    * 2.4 Following day\n    * 2.5 Contemporary accounts\n    * 2.6 Strategic analysis\n  * 3 Aftermath\n    * 3.1 Umayyad retreat and second invasion\n      * 3.1.1 Umayyad invasion (735–39)\n    * 3.2 Advance to Narbonne\n    * 3.3 Carolingian dynasty\n  * 4 Historical and macrohistorical views\n    * 4.1 In Western history\n    * 4.2 Adolf Hitler on the Battle of Tours\n    * 4.3 In Muslim history\n  * 5 Current historical debate on macrohistorical impact of Battle of Tours\n    * 5.1 Supporting the significance of Tours as a world-altering event\n    * 5.2 Objecting to the significance of Tours as a world-altering event\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 Bibliography\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Background[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/The_Saracen_Army_outside_Paris%2C_730-32_AD.png/170px-\nThe_Saracen_Army_outside_Paris%2C_730-32_AD.png)](/wiki/File:The_Saracen_Army_outside_Paris,_730-32_AD.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Saracen_Army_outside_Paris,_730-32_AD.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe exoticism of [Saracen](/wiki/Saracen \"Saracen\") invaders is stressed in\nthis detail from _The Saracen Army outside Paris_ , by [Julius Schnorr von\nCarolsfeld](/wiki/Julius_Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld \"Julius Schnorr von\nCarolsfeld\"), painted 1822–27, which actually depicts a fictional incident\nfrom [Ludovico Ariosto](/wiki/Ludovico_Ariosto \"Ludovico Ariosto\") (Cassino\nMassimo, Rome)[26]\n\nThe Battle of Tours followed two decades of [Umayyad\nconquests](/wiki/Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania \"Umayyad conquest of Hispania\")\nin Europe which had begun with the invasion of the\n[Visigothic](/wiki/Visigoths \"Visigoths\") [Christian](/wiki/Christian\n\"Christian\") Kingdoms of the [Iberian Peninsula](/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula\n\"Iberian Peninsula\") in 711. These were followed by military expeditions into\nthe [Frankish](/wiki/Franks \"Franks\") territories of [Gaul](/wiki/Gaul\n\"Gaul\"), former provinces of the [Roman Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman\nEmpire\"). Umayyad military campaigns had reached northward into Aquitaine and\n[Burgundy](/wiki/Burgundy_\\(region\\) \"Burgundy \\(region\\)\"), including a major\nengagement at [Bordeaux](/wiki/Bordeaux \"Bordeaux\") and a raid on\n[Autun](/wiki/Autun \"Autun\"). Charles's victory is widely believed to have\nstopped the northward advance of Umayyad forces from the [Iberian\nPeninsula](/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula \"Iberian Peninsula\"), and to have preserved\n[Christianity](/wiki/Christianity \"Christianity\") in Europe during a period\nwhen [Muslim](/wiki/Islam \"Islam\") rule was overrunning the remains of the old\n[Roman](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman Empire\") and [Persian\nEmpires](/wiki/Persian_Empire \"Persian Empire\").[27]\n\nMost historians assume that the two armies met where the rivers\n[Clain](/wiki/Clain \"Clain\") and [Vienne](/wiki/Vienne_\\(river\\) \"Vienne\n\\(river\\)\") join between Tours and Poitiers. The number of troops in each army\nis not known. The _[Mozarabic Chronicle of\n754](/wiki/Mozarabic_Chronicle_of_754 \"Mozarabic Chronicle of 754\")_ , a Latin\ncontemporary source which describes the battle in greater detail than any\nother Latin or Arabic source, states that \"the people of\n[Austrasia](/wiki/Austrasia \"Austrasia\") [the Frankish forces], greater in\nnumber of soldiers and formidably armed, killed the king, Abd ar-Rahman\",[28]\nwhich agrees with many Arab and Muslim historians. However, virtually all\nWestern sources disagree, and estimate the Franks at 30,000, less than half\nthe Muslim force.[29]\n\nSome modern historians, using estimates of what the land was able to support,\nand what Martel could have raised from his realm and supported during the\ncampaign, believe the total Muslim force, counting the outlying raiding\nparties, which rejoined the main body before Tours, outnumbered the Franks.\nDrawing on non-contemporary Muslim sources, Creasy describes the Umayyad\nforces as 80,000 strong or more. Writing in 1999, [Paul K.\nDavis](/wiki/Paul_K._Davis_\\(historian\\) \"Paul K. Davis \\(historian\\)\")\nestimates the Umayyad forces at 80,000 and the Franks at about 30,000,[29]\nwhile noting that modern historians have estimated the strength of the Umayyad\narmy at Tours at between 20–80,000.[30] However, Edward J. Schoenfeld,\n(rejecting the older figures of 60–400,000 Umayyad and 75,000 Franks),\ncontends that \"estimates that the Umayyads had over fifty thousand troops (and\nthe Franks even more) are logistically impossible.\"[22] Similarly, historian\n[Victor Davis Hanson](/wiki/Victor_Davis_Hanson \"Victor Davis Hanson\")\nbelieves both armies were roughly the same size, about 30,000 men.[31]\n\nContemporary historical analysis may be more accurate than the medieval\nsources as the modern figures are based on estimates of the logistical ability\nof the countryside to support these numbers of men and animals. Both Davis and\nHanson point out that both armies had to live off the countryside, neither\nhaving a commissary system sufficient to provide supplies for a campaign.\nOther sources give the following estimates: \"Gore places the Frankish army at\n15,000–20,000, although other estimates range from 30,000 to 80,000. In spite\nof wildly varying estimates of the Muslim force, he places that army as around\n20,000–25,000. Other estimates also range up to 80,000, with 50,000 not an\nuncommon estimate.\" [13]\n\nLosses during the battle are unknown but chroniclers later claimed that\nCharles Martel's force lost about 1,500 while the Umayyad force was said to\nhave suffered massive casualties of up to 375,000 men. However, these same\ncasualty figures were recorded in the _[Liber\nPontificalis](/wiki/Liber_Pontificalis \"Liber Pontificalis\")_ for Duke [Odo\nthe Great](/wiki/Odo_the_Great \"Odo the Great\")'s victory at the [Battle of\nToulouse (721)](/wiki/Battle_of_Toulouse_\\(721\\) \"Battle of Toulouse\n\\(721\\)\"). [Paul the Deacon](/wiki/Paul_the_Deacon \"Paul the Deacon\") reported\ncorrectly in his _[History of the Lombards](/wiki/History_of_the_Lombards\n\"History of the Lombards\")_ (written around the year 785) that the _Liber\nPontificalis_ mentioned these casualty figures in relation to Odo's victory at\nToulouse (though he claimed that Charles Martel fought in the battle alongside\nOdo), but later writers, probably \"influenced by the _[Continuations of\nFredegar](/wiki/Chronicle_of_Fredegar \"Chronicle of Fredegar\")_ , attributed\nthe Muslims casualties solely to Charles Martel, and the battle in which they\nfell became unequivocally that of Poitiers.\"[32] The _[Vita\nPardulfi](/wiki/Vita_Pardulfi \"Vita Pardulfi\")_ , written in the middle of the\neighth century, reports that after the battle 'Abd-al-Raḥmân's forces burned\nand looted their way through the Limousin on their way back to Al-Andalus,\nwhich implies that they were not destroyed to the extent imagined in the\n_Continuations of Fredegar_.[33]\n\n### Moors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Moors\")]\n\nMain articles: [Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi](/wiki/Abdul_Rahman_Al_Ghafiqi \"Abdul\nRahman Al Ghafiqi\") and [Umayyad](/wiki/Umayyad \"Umayyad\")\n\nThe invasion of [Hispania](/wiki/Hispania \"Hispania\"), and then\n[Gaul](/wiki/Gaul \"Gaul\"), was led by the [Umayyad\nDynasty](/wiki/Umayyad_Dynasty \"Umayyad Dynasty\")\n([Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language \"Arabic language\"): بنو أمية banū umayya /\nالأمويون al-umawiyyūn‎ also \"Umawi\"), the first dynasty of Sunni caliphs of\nthe Sunni Islamic empire after the reign (or usurpation of the first three,\nper Shia Muslim belief) of the [Rashidun](/wiki/Rashidun \"Rashidun\") Caliphs\n([Abu Bakr](/wiki/Abu_Bakr \"Abu Bakr\"), [Umar](/wiki/Umar \"Umar\"),\n[Uthman](/wiki/Uthman \"Uthman\"), and [Ali](/wiki/Ali \"Ali\")) ended. The\nUmayyad Caliphate, at the time of the Battle of Tours, was perhaps the world's\nforemost military power. Great expansion of the Caliphate occurred under the\nreign of the Umayyads. Muslim armies pushed east across [Persia](/wiki/Persia\n\"Persia\") and west across [North Africa](/wiki/North_Africa \"North Africa\")\nthrough the late 7th century.[34]\n\nIn 711–18, [Tariq ibn Ziyad](/wiki/Tariq_ibn_Ziyad \"Tariq ibn Ziyad\") led\nforces across the [Strait of Gibraltar](/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar \"Strait of\nGibraltar\") to conquer the [Visigothic Kingdom of\nHispania](/wiki/Visigothic_Kingdom \"Visigothic Kingdom\"). The Muslim empire\nunder the Umayyads was now a vast domain that ruled a diverse array of\npeoples. It had destroyed what were the two former foremost military powers,\nthe [Sasanian Empire](/wiki/Sasanian_Empire \"Sasanian Empire\"), which it\nabsorbed completely, and the greater part of the [Byzantine\nEmpire](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire \"Byzantine Empire\"), including Syria, Armenia\nand North Africa, although [Leo the Isaurian](/wiki/Leo_III_the_Isaurian \"Leo\nIII the Isaurian\") stemmed the tide when he defeated the Umayyads at the\n[Battle of Akroinon](/wiki/Battle_of_Akroinon \"Battle of Akroinon\") (739),\ntheir final campaign in [Anatolia](/wiki/Anatolia \"Anatolia\").[34]\n\n### Franks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Franks\")]\n\nMain articles: [Charles Martel](/wiki/Charles_Martel \"Charles Martel\") and\n[Francia](/wiki/Francia \"Francia\")\n\nThe Frankish realm under Charles Martel was the foremost military power of\nWestern Europe. During most of his tenure in office as commander-in-chief of\nthe Franks, it consisted of north and eastern France (Austrasia, Neustria and\nBurgundy), most of western Germany, and the Low Countries (Luxembourg, Belgium\nand the Netherlands). The Frankish realm had begun to progress towards\nbecoming the first real imperial power in western Europe since the fall of\nRome.

Al-Samh\nset up his capital from 720 at [Narbonne](/wiki/Narbonne \"Narbonne\"), which\nthe Moors called Arbūna.

Duke Odo the Great broke the siege of [Toulouse](/wiki/Toulouse\n\"Toulouse\"), taking Al-Samh ibn Malik's forces by surprise. Al-Samh ibn Malik\nwas mortally wounded. This defeat did not stop incursions into old Roman Gaul,\nas Moorish forces, soundly based in Narbonne and easily resupplied by sea,\nstruck eastwards in the 720s, penetrating as far as [Autun](/wiki/Autun\n\"Autun\") in [Burgundy](/wiki/Burgundy \"Burgundy\") in 725.[35]\n\nThreatened by both the Umayyads in the south and by the Franks in the north,\nin 730 Odo allied himself with the Berber commander [Uthman ibn\nNaissa](/wiki/Munuza \"Munuza\"), called \"Munuza\" by the Franks, the deputy\ngovernor of what would later become [Catalonia](/wiki/Catalonia \"Catalonia\").\nTo seal the alliance, Uthman was given Odo's daughter Lampagie in marriage,\nand Moorish raids across the [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees \"Pyrenees\"), Odo's\nsouthern border, ceased.[35] However, the next year, the Berber leader killed\nthe bishop of Urgell Nambaudus and detached from his Arabs masters in Cordova.\nAbdul Raḥman in turn sent an expedition to crush his revolt, and next directed\nhis attention against Uthman's ally Odo.[36]\n\nThe Aquitanian duke Odo collected his army at [Bordeaux](/wiki/Bordeaux\n\"Bordeaux\"), but was defeated, and Bordeaux plundered. During the following\n[Battle of the River Garonne](/wiki/Battle_of_the_River_Garonne \"Battle of the\nRiver Garonne\"), the _[Chronicle of 754](/wiki/Chronicle_of_754 \"Chronicle of\n754\")_[37] commented that \"God alone knows the number of the slain\".[38] The\nChronicle of 754 continues, saying they \"pierced through the mountains,\ntrampled over rough and level ground, plundered far into the country of the\nFranks, and smote all with the sword, insomuch that when Eudo came to battle\nwith them at the River Garonne, he fled.\"\n\n### Odo's appeal to the\nFranks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Odo's appeal to the Franks\")]\n\nOdo, who despite the heavy losses was reorganizing his troops, gave the\nFrankish leader notice of the impending danger knocking on the heartland of\nhis realm, and appealed to the Franks for assistance, which Charles Martel\nonly granted after Odo agreed to submit to Frankish authority.\n\nIt appears that the Umayyads were not aware of the true strength of the\nFranks. The Umayyad forces were not particularly concerned about any of the\n[Germanic](/wiki/Germanic_peoples \"Germanic peoples\") tribes, including the\nFranks, and the Arab chronicles of that age show that awareness of the Franks\nas a growing military power only came after the Battle of Tours.\n\nFurther, the Umayyads appear not to have scouted northward for potential foes,\nfor if they had, they surely would have noted Charles Martel as a force to be\nreckoned with in his own account, because of his growing domination of much of\nEurope from 717: this might have alerted the Umayyads that a real power led by\na gifted general was rising from the ashes of the [Western Roman\nEmpire](/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire \"Western Roman Empire\").\n\n### Umayyad advance towards the\nLoire[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Umayyad advance towards the Loire\")]\n\nIn 732, the Umayyad advance force was proceeding north towards the\n[Loire](/wiki/Loire \"Loire\") river having outpaced their supply train and a\nlarge part of their army. Essentially, having easily destroyed all resistance\nin that part of Gaul, the invading army had split off into several raiding\nparties, while the main body advanced more slowly.\n\nThe Umayyads delayed their attack to so late in the year probably because part\nof the army needed to live off the land as they advanced. They had to wait\nuntil the area's wheat harvest was ready and then until a reasonable amount of\nthe harvest was threshed (slowly by hand with flails) and stored.\n\nThe reason why Odo was defeated so easily at Bordeaux and Garonne, but had won\n11 years earlier at the [Battle of Toulouse](/wiki/Battle_of_Toulouse_\\(721\\)\n\"Battle of Toulouse \\(721\\)\") is simple. At Toulouse, Odo managed a surprise\nattack against an overconfident and unprepared foe. The Umayyad forces were\nmostly infantry, and what cavalry they did have never got a chance to\nmobilize. As [Herman of Carinthia](/wiki/Herman_of_Carinthia \"Herman of\nCarinthia\") wrote in one of his translations of a history of al-Andalus, Odo\nmanaged a highly successful encircling envelopment which took the attackers\ntotally by surprise – the result was a chaotic slaughter of the Muslim forces.\n\nAt Bordeaux and again at Garonne, the Umayyad forces were mostly cavalry, and\nhad the chance to mobilize, which led to the devastation of Odo's army. Odo's\nforces, like other European troops of that era, lacked stirrups, [possibly\nexplaining](/wiki/Stirrup#Great_Stirrup_Controversy \"Stirrup\") why they had no\nheavy cavalry. Most of their troops were infantry. The Umayyad heavy cavalry\nbroke the Frankish infantry in their first charge, and then slaughtered them\nas they broke and ran.\n\nThe invading force went on to devastate southern Gaul. A possible motive,\naccording to the second continuator of the _[Chronicle of\nFredegar](/wiki/Chronicle_of_Fredegar \"Chronicle of Fredegar\")_ , was the\nriches of the [Abbey of Saint Martin of\nTours](/wiki/Abbey_of_Saint_Martin_of_Tours \"Abbey of Saint Martin of Tours\"),\nthe most prestigious and holiest shrine in Western Europe at the time.[39]\nUpon hearing this [Austrasia](/wiki/Austrasia \"Austrasia\")'s [Mayor of the\nPalace](/wiki/Mayor_of_the_Palace \"Mayor of the Palace\"), [Charles\nMartel](/wiki/Charles_Martel \"Charles Martel\") prepared his army and marched\nsouth, avoiding the old Roman roads hoping to take the Muslims by surprise.\n\n## Battle (October\n732)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Battle \\(October 732\\)\")]\n\n[![Battle of Tours is located in\nFrance](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/France_location_map-\nRegions_and_departements-2016.svg/250px-France_location_map-\nRegions_and_departements-2016.svg.png)](/wiki/File:France_location_map-\nRegions_and_departements-2016.svg \"Battle of Tours is located in France\")\n\n![Battle of\nTours](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/8px-\nRed_pog.svg.png)\n\nBattle of Tours\n\n[](/wiki/File:France_location_map-Regions_and_departements-2016.svg\n\"File:France location map-Regions and departements-2016.svg\")\n\nThe location of the battle on modern-day France\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Charles achieved the total\nsurprise he had hoped for. He then chose not to attack and rather began\nfighting in a defensive, [phalanx](/wiki/Phalanx \"Phalanx\")-like\nformation.[31] According to Arab sources, the Franks drew up in a large\nsquare, with hills and trees in their front to diminish or break up Muslim\ncavalry charges.\n\nFor seven days, the two armies faced off with minor skirmishes. The Umayyads\nwaited for their full strength to arrive. 'Abd-al-Raḥmân, despite being a\nproven commander, had been outmaneuvered; he had allowed Charles to\nconcentrate his forces and pick the field of battle. Furthermore, it was\nimpossible for the Umayyads to judge the size of Martel's army, since Charles\nhad used the trees and forest to screen his true numbers.\n\nMartel's infantry were his best hope for victory. Seasoned and battle-\nhardened, most of them had fought with him for years, some as far back as 717.\nIn addition to his army, he also had levies of militia which had not seen\nsignificant military use except for gathering food and harassing the Muslim\narmy.\n\nWhile many historians through the centuries have believed that the Franks were\noutnumbered at the onset of battle by at least two to one, the most authentic\nsource called the Mozarabic Chronicle of 754, points to the contrary.[40]\n\nCharles correctly assumed that 'Abd-al-Raḥmân would feel compelled to give\nbattle, and move on and try to loot Tours. Neither side wanted to attack. Abd-\nal-Raḥmân felt he had to sack Tours, which meant he had to go through the\nFrankish army on the hill in front of him. Charles's decision to wait and stay\non the hills proved crucial, as it forced the Umayyad Cavalry to charge uphill\nand through trees, diminishing their lethality.\n\nCharles had been preparing for this confrontation since the [Battle of\nToulouse](/wiki/Battle_of_Toulouse_\\(721\\) \"Battle of Toulouse \\(721\\)\") a\ndecade earlier.[31] Gibbon believes, as do most historians, that Charles had\nmade the best of a bad situation. Though allegedly outnumbered and without any\nheavy cavalry, Charles had tough, battle-hardened infantrymen who believed in\nhim implicitly. Moreover, as Davis points out, these infantrymen were heavily\narmed, each man carrying up to perhaps 75 pounds (34 kg) of armour into\nbattle.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nFormed into a [phalanx formation](/wiki/Phalanx_formation \"Phalanx\nformation\"), they were able to withstand a cavalry charge better than might be\nexpected, especially as Charles had been able to secure the high ground – with\ntrees before him further to dilute any cavalry charges. The failure of Arab\nintelligence extended to the fact that they were totally unaware of how good\nMartel's forces were; Martel had trained them for a decade. And while he was\nwell aware of the Caliphate's strengths and weaknesses, they knew almost\nnothing about the Franks. It was a total failure of the Muslim intelligence\nservices.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe logistical failures of the Muslims included their attire. The Franks were\ndressed for the cold. The Arabs had very light clothing more suitable for the\nNorth African winters rather than the European winters.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe battle eventually became a waiting game in which the Muslims did not want\nto attack an army that could possibly be numerically superior and wanted the\nFranks to come out into the open. The Franks formed up in a thick defensive\nformation and waited for them to charge uphill. The battle finally began on\nthe seventh day, as 'Abd-al-Raḥmân did not want to wait any longer with winter\napproaching.\n\n### Engagement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Engagement\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Young_Folks%27_History_of_Rome_illus442%2C_Battle_of_Tours.png/170px-\nYoung_Folks%27_History_of_Rome_illus442%2C_Battle_of_Tours.png)](/wiki/File:Young_Folks%27_History_of_Rome_illus442,_Battle_of_Tours.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Young_Folks%27_History_of_Rome_illus442,_Battle_of_Tours.png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nWestern knight fighting against an Arabian horseman. (Illustration from the\n19th century)\n\n'Abd-al-Raḥmân trusted the tactical superiority of his cavalry and had them\ncharge repeatedly. In one of the few instances where [medieval](/wiki/Medieval\n\"Medieval\") [infantry](/wiki/Infantry \"Infantry\") stood up against cavalry\ncharges,[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] the disciplined Frankish soldiers withstood the\nassaults, though according to Arab sources, the Arab cavalry broke into the\nFrankish square several times. Despite this, the Franks did not break. The\nwell-trained Frank soldiers accomplished what was not thought possible at that\ntime: infantry withstanding a heavy cavalry charge. Paul Davis says the core\nof Charles's army was a professional infantry which was both highly\ndisciplined and well motivated, \"having campaigned with him all over Europe\".\nThe _Mozarabic Chronicle of 754_ says:\n\n> And in the shock of battle the men of the North seemed like a sea that\n> cannot be moved. Firmly they stood, one close to another, forming as it were\n> a bulwark of ice; and with great blows of their swords they hewed down the\n> Arabs. Drawn up in a band around their chief, the people of the Austrasians\n> carried all before them. Their tireless hands drove their swords down to the\n> breasts [of the foe].\n\n### Turning\npoint[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Turning point\")]\n\nUmayyad troops who had broken into the square had tried to kill Charles, but\nhis [liege](/wiki/Feudalism \"Feudalism\") men surrounded him and would not be\nbroken. The battle was still in flux when – Frankish histories claim – a\nrumour went through the Umayyad army that Frankish scouts threatened the booty\nthat they had taken from [Bordeaux](/wiki/Bordeaux \"Bordeaux\"). Some of the\nUmayyad troops at once broke off the battle and returned to camp to secure\ntheir loot. According to Muslim accounts of the battle, in the midst of the\nfighting on the second day (Frankish accounts have the battle lasting one day\nonly), scouts from the Franks sent by Charles began to raid the camp and\nsupply train (including slaves and other plunder).[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nCharles supposedly had sent scouts to cause chaos in the Umayyad base camp,\nand free as many of the slaves as possible, hoping to draw off part of his\nfoe. This succeeded, as many of the Umayyad cavalry returned to their camp. To\nthe rest of the Muslim army, this appeared to be a full-scale retreat, and\nsoon it became one.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nBoth Western and Muslim histories agree that while trying to stop the retreat,\n'Abd-al-Raḥmân became surrounded, which led to his death, and the Umayyad\ntroops then withdrew altogether to their camp. \"All the host fled before the\nenemy\", candidly wrote one Arabic source, \"and many died in the flight\". The\nFranks resumed their phalanx, and rested in place through the night, believing\nthe battle would resume at dawn the following morning.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Following\nday[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Following day\")]\n\nThe next day, when the Umayyad forces did not renew the battle, the Franks\nfeared an ambush. Charles at first believed that the Umayyad forces were\ntrying to lure him down the hill and into the open. This tactic he knew he had\nto resist at all costs; he had in fact disciplined his troops for years to\nunder no circumstances break formation and come out in the open.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nOnly after extensive reconnaissance of the Umayyad camp by Frankish soldiers –\nwhich by both historical accounts had been so hastily abandoned that even the\ntents remained, as the Umayyad forces headed back to\n[Iberia](/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula \"Iberian Peninsula\") with what loot remained\nthat they could carry – was it discovered that the Muslims had retreated\nduring the night.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Contemporary\naccounts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Contemporary accounts\")]\n\nThe [Mozarabic Chronicle of 754](/wiki/Mozarabic_Chronicle_of_754 \"Mozarabic\nChronicle of 754\") \"describes the battle in greater detail than any other\nLatin or Arabic source\".[41] It says of the encounter that,\n\n> While Abd ar-Rahman was pursuing Odo, he decided to despoil Tours by\n> destroying its palaces and burning its churches.

It goes on to say Charles \"scattered them like the\nstubble\".\n\nThe Latin word used for \"warrior\", _belligerator_ , \"is from the [Book of\nMaccabees](/wiki/Books_of_the_Maccabees \"Books of the Maccabees\"), chapters 15\nand 16, which describe huge battles.[42]\n\nIt is thought that [Bede](/wiki/Bede \"Bede\")'s _[Ecclesiastical History of the\nEnglish People](/wiki/Ecclesiastical_History_of_the_English_People\n\"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\")_ (Book V, Chapter XXIV)\nincludes a reference to the Battle of Poitiers: \"...a dreadful plague of\nSaracens ravaged France with miserable slaughter, but they not long after in\nthat country received the punishment due to their wickedness\".[43]\n\n### Strategic\nanalysis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Strategic analysis\")]\n\nGibbon makes the point[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] that 'Abd-al-Raḥmân did not move at once\nagainst Charles Martel, and was surprised by him at Tours as Charles had\nmarched over the mountains avoiding the roads to surprise the Muslim invaders.\nThus, Charles selected the time and place they would collide.\n\n'Abd-al-Raḥmân was a good general, but failed to do two things he should have\ndone before the battle:\n\n  * He either assumed that the Franks would not come to the aid of their Aquitanian rivals, or did not care, and he thus failed to assess their strength before invasion.\n  * He failed to scout the movements of the [Frankish](/wiki/Frankish_Empire \"Frankish Empire\") army.\n\nThese failures disadvantaged the Muslim army in the following ways:\n\n  * The invaders were burdened with booty that played a role in the battle.\n  * They had casualties before they fought the battle.\n  * Weaker opponents such as Odo were not bypassed, whom they could have picked off at will later, while moving at once to force battle with the real power in Europe, and at least partially picked the battlefield.\n\nWhile some military historians point out that leaving enemies in your rear is\nnot generally wise, the Mongols proved that indirect attack, and bypassing\nweaker foes to eliminate the strongest first, can be a devastatingly effective\nmode of invasion. In this case, those enemies were virtually no danger, given\nthe ease with which the Muslims destroyed them. The real danger was Charles,\nand the failure to scout Gaul adequately was disastrous.\n\nAccording to [Creasy](/wiki/Edward_Shepherd_Creasy \"Edward Shepherd\nCreasy\")[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_], both western and Muslim histories agree the\nbattle was hard fought, and that the Umayyad heavy cavalry had broken into the\nsquare, but agreed that the Franks were in formation still strongly resisting.\n\nCharles could not afford to stand idly by while Frankish territories were\nthreatened. He would have to face the Umayyad armies sooner or later, and his\nmen were enraged by the utter devastation of the Aquitanians and wanted to\nfight. But Sir Edward Creasy noted that,\n\n> when we remember that Charles had no standing army, and the independent\n> spirit of the Frank warriors who followed his standard, it seems most\n> probable that it was not in his power to adopt the cautious policy of\n> watching the invaders, and wearing out their strength by delay. So dreadful\n> and so widespread were the ravages of the Saracenic light cavalry throughout\n> Gaul, that it must have been impossible to restrain for any length of time\n> the indignant ardor of the Franks. And, even if Charles could have persuaded\n> his men to look tamely on while the Arabs stormed more towns and desolated\n> more districts, he could not have kept an army together when the usual\n> period of a military expedition had expired.[44]\n\nBoth [Hallam](/wiki/Henry_Hallam \"Henry Hallam\") and\n[Watson](/wiki/William_E._Watson \"William E. Watson\")[41] argue that had\nCharles failed, there was no remaining force to protect Western Europe. Hallam\nperhaps said it best: \"It may justly be reckoned among those few battles of\nwhich a contrary event would have essentially varied the drama of the world in\nall its subsequent scenes: with [Marathon](/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon \"Battle of\nMarathon\"), [Arbela](/wiki/Battle_of_Gaugamela \"Battle of Gaugamela\"), the\n[Metaurus](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Metaurus \"Battle of the Metaurus\"),\n[Châlons](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Catalaunian_Plains \"Battle of the Catalaunian\nPlains\") and [Leipzig](/wiki/Battle_of_Leipzig \"Battle of Leipzig\").\"[45]\n\nStrategically, and tactically, Charles probably made the best decision he\ncould in waiting until his enemies least expected him to intervene, and then\nmarching by stealth to catch them by surprise at a battlefield of his\nchoosing. Probably he and his own men did not realize the seriousness of the\nbattle they had fought, as one historian put it: \"few battles are remembered\nover 1,000 years after they are fought, but the Battle of Poitiers is an\nexception [...] Charles Martel turned back a Muslim raid that had it been\nallowed to continue, might have conquered Gaul.\"[46]\n\n## Aftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\n### Umayyad retreat and second\ninvasion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Umayyad retreat and second invasion\")]\n\nThe Umayyad army retreated south over the [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees\n\"Pyrenees\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Charles continued to drive the Umayyad forces\nfrom France in subsequent years. After the death (c. 735) of Odo, who had\nreluctantly acknowledged Charles' [suzerainty](/wiki/Suzerainty \"Suzerainty\")\nin 719, Charles wished to unite Odo's Duchy to himself, and went there to\nelicit the proper [homage](/wiki/Homage_\\(feudal\\) \"Homage \\(feudal\\)\") of the\nAquitainians. But the nobility proclaimed Hunold, Odo's son, as the Duke, and\nCharles recognized his legitimacy when the Umayyads entered\n[Provence](/wiki/Provence \"Provence\") as part of an alliance with Duke\n[Maurontus](/wiki/Maurontus \"Maurontus\") the next year.[47]\n\nHunold, who originally resisted acknowledging Charles as overlord, soon had\nlittle choice. He acknowledged Charles as his overlord, albeit not for long,\nand Charles confirmed his Duchy.\n\n#### Umayyad invasion\n(735–39)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Umayyad invasion \\(735–39\\)\")]\n\nIn 735, the new governor of al-Andalus again invaded Gaul. [Antonio\nSantosuosso](/wiki/Antonio_Santosuosso \"Antonio Santosuosso\") and other\nhistorians detail how the new governor of Al-Andalus, 'Uqba b. Al-Hajjaj,\nagain moved into France to avenge the defeat at Poitiers and to spread Islam.\nSantosuosso notes that 'Uqba b. Al-Hajjaj converted about 2,000 Christians he\ncaptured over his career. In the last major attempt at forcible invasion of\nGaul through Iberia, a sizable invasion force was assembled at\n[Saragossa](/wiki/Zaragoza \"Zaragoza\") and entered what is now French\nterritory in 735, crossed the River Rhone and captured and looted\n[Arles](/wiki/Arles \"Arles\"). From there, he struck into the heart of\nProvence, ending with the capture of [Avignon](/wiki/Avignon \"Avignon\"),\ndespite strong resistance.[48]\n\nUqba b. Al-Hajjaj's forces remained in French territory for about four\nyears,[_[specify](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]\ncarrying raids to Lyons, Burgundy, and Piedmont. Charles Martel invaded\nSeptimania in two campaigns in 736 and 739, but was forced back again to\nFrankish territory under his control. Alessandro Santosuosso strongly argues\nthat the second (Umayyad) expedition was probably more dangerous than the\nfirst. The second expedition's failure put an end to any serious Muslim\nexpedition across the [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees \"Pyrenees\"), although raids\ncontinued. Plans for further large-scale attempts were hindered by internal\nturmoil in the Umayyad lands which often made enemies out of their own\nkind.[48]\n\n### Advance to\nNarbonne[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Advance to Narbonne\")]\n\nDespite the defeat at Tours, the Umayyads remained in control of Narbonne and\n[Septimania](/wiki/Septimania \"Septimania\") for another 27 years, though they\ncould not expand further. The treaties reached earlier with the local\npopulation stood firm and were further consolidated in 734 when the governor\nof Narbonne, [Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri](/wiki/Yusuf_ibn_%27Abd_al-\nRahman_al-Fihri \"Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri\"), concluded agreements\nwith several towns on common defense arrangements against the encroachments of\nCharles Martel, who had systematically brought the south to heel as he\nextended his domains. He destroyed Umayyad armies and fortresses at the\n[Battle of Avignon](/wiki/Battle_of_Avignon \"Battle of Avignon\") and the\n[Battle of Nîmes](/wiki/Battle_of_N%C3%AEmes \"Battle of Nîmes\").\n\nThe army attempting to relieve Narbonne met Charles in open battle at the\n[Battle of the River Berre](/wiki/Battle_of_the_River_Berre \"Battle of the\nRiver Berre\") and was destroyed. However, Charles failed in his attempt to\ntake Narbonne by siege in 737, when the city was jointly defended by its\nMuslim Arab and Berber, and its Christian [Visigothic](/wiki/Visigoths\n\"Visigoths\") citizens.\n\n### Carolingian\ndynasty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit\nsection: Carolingian dynasty\")]\n\nMain articles: [Francia](/wiki/Francia \"Francia\"), [Carolingian\nEmpire](/wiki/Carolingian_Empire \"Carolingian Empire\"), [Pepin the\nShort](/wiki/Pepin_the_Short \"Pepin the Short\"), and\n[Charlemagne](/wiki/Charlemagne \"Charlemagne\")\n\nReluctant to tie down his army for a siege that could last years, and\nbelieving he could not afford the losses of an all-out frontal assault such as\nhe had used at [Arles](/wiki/Arles \"Arles\"), Charles was content to isolate\nthe few remaining invaders in [Narbonne](/wiki/Narbonne \"Narbonne\") and\n[Septimania](/wiki/Septimania \"Septimania\"). The threat of invasion was\ndiminished after the Umayyad defeat at Narbonne, and the unified\n[Caliphate](/wiki/Caliphate \"Caliphate\") would collapse into [civil\nwar](/wiki/Civil_war \"Civil war\") in 750 at the [Battle of the\nZab](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Zab \"Battle of the Zab\").\n\nIt was left to Charles' son, [Pepin the Short](/wiki/Pepin_the_Short \"Pepin\nthe Short\"), to force Narbonne's surrender in 759, thus bringing Narbonne into\nthe Frankish domains. The [Umayyad dynasty](/wiki/Umayyad_dynasty \"Umayyad\ndynasty\") was expelled, driven back to Al-Andalus where [Abd al-Rahman\nI](/wiki/Abd_al-Rahman_I \"Abd al-Rahman I\") established an emirate in Córdoba\nin opposition to the [Abbasid](/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate \"Abbasid Caliphate\")\nCaliph in [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\").\n\nCharles's grandson, [Charlemagne](/wiki/Charlemagne \"Charlemagne\"), became the\nfirst Christian ruler to begin what would be called the\n[Reconquista](/wiki/Reconquista \"Reconquista\") from Europe. In the northeast\nof Spain the Frankish emperors established the [Marca\nHispanica](/wiki/Marca_Hispanica \"Marca Hispanica\") across the\n[Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees \"Pyrenees\") in part of what today is\n[Catalonia](/wiki/Catalonia \"Catalonia\"), reconquering [Girona](/wiki/Girona\n\"Girona\") in 785 and [Barcelona](/wiki/Barcelona \"Barcelona\") in 801. This\nformed a buffer zone against Muslim lands across the [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees\n\"Pyrenees\"). Historian J.M. Roberts said in 1993 of the Carolingian Dynasty:\n\n> \"It produced Charles Martel, the soldier who turned the Arabs back at Tours,\n> and the supporter of [Saint Boniface](/wiki/Saint_Boniface \"Saint Boniface\")\n> the Evangelizer of Germany. This is a considerable double mark to have left\n> on the history of Europe.\"[49]\n\nBefore the Battle of Tours, stirrups may have been unknown in the west. [Lynn\nTownsend White Jr.](/wiki/Lynn_Townsend_White_Jr. \"Lynn Townsend White Jr.\")\nargues that the adoption of the stirrup for cavalry was the direct cause for\nthe development of feudalism in the Frankish realm by Charles Martel and his\nheirs.[50]\n\n## Historical and macrohistorical\nviews[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: Historical and macrohistorical views\")]\n\nThe historical views of this battle fall into three great phases, both in the\nEast and especially in the West. Western historians, beginning with the\nMozarabic Chronicle of 754, stressed the macrohistorical impact of the battle,\nas did the Continuations of Fredegar. This became a claim that Charles had\nsaved Christianity, as Gibbon and his generation of historians agreed that the\nBattle of Tours was unquestionably decisive in world history.\n\nModern historians have essentially fallen into two camps on the issue. The\nfirst camp essentially agrees with Gibbon, and the other argues that the\nBattle has been massively overstated – turned from a raid in force to an\ninvasion, and from a mere annoyance to the Caliph to a shattering defeat that\nhelped end the Islamic Expansion Era. It is essential however, to note that\nwithin the first group, those who agree the Battle was of macrohistorical\nimportance, there are a number of historians who take a more moderate and\nnuanced view of the significance of the battle, in contrast to the more\ndramatic and rhetorical approach of Gibbon. The best example of this school is\nWilliam E. Watson, who does believe the battle has such importance, as will be\ndiscussed below, but analyzes it militarily, culturally and politically,\nrather than seeing it as a classic \"Muslim versus Christian\"\nconfrontation.[41]\n\nIn the East, Arab histories followed a similar path. First, the battle was\nregarded as a disastrous defeat; then, it largely faded from Arab histories,\nleading to a modern dispute which regards it as either a secondary loss to the\ngreat defeat of the [Second Siege of\nConstantinople](/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_\\(717%E2%80%93718\\) \"Siege of\nConstantinople \\(717–718\\)\"), where the Bulgarian Emperor\n[Tervel](/wiki/Tervel_of_Bulgaria \"Tervel of Bulgaria\") played a crucial role,\nor a part of a series of great macrohistorical defeats which together brought\nabout the fall of the first Caliphate. With the Byzantines and Bulgarians\ntogether with the Franks both successfully blocking further expansion,\ninternal social troubles came to a head, starting with the Great [Berber\nRevolt](/wiki/Berber_Revolt \"Berber Revolt\") of 740, and ending with the\n[Battle of the Zab](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Zab \"Battle of the Zab\"), and the\ndestruction of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\n### In Western\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit\nsection: In Western history\")]\n\nThe first wave of real \"modern\" historians, especially scholars on Rome and\nthe medieval period, such as [Edward Gibbon](/wiki/Edward_Gibbon \"Edward\nGibbon\"), contended that had Charles fallen, the Umayyad Caliphate would have\neasily conquered a divided Europe. Gibbon famously observed:\n\n> A victorious line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles from\n> the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire; the repetition of an equal\n> space would have carried the Saracens to the confines of Poland and the\n> Highlands of Scotland; the Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or\n> Euphrates, and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a naval combat\n> into the mouth of the Thames. Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would\n> now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to\n> a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of\n> Mahomet.[51]\n\nNor was Gibbon alone in lavishing praise on Charles as the savior of\n[Christendom](/wiki/Christendom \"Christendom\") and [western\ncivilization](/wiki/Western_civilization \"Western civilization\"). [H. G.\nWells](/wiki/H._G._Wells \"H. G. Wells\") in his _A Short History of the World_\nsaid in Chapter XLV \"The Development of Latin Christendom\": \"The Moslim when\nthey crossed the [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees \"Pyrenees\") in 720 found this\nFrankish kingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the\nPalace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive\ndefeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands. This Charles Martel was practically\noverlord of Europe north of the Alps from the [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees\n\"Pyrenees\") to Hungary. He ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords\nspeaking French-Latin, and High and Low German languages.\"[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nGibbon was echoed a century later by the Belgian historian [Godefroid\nKurth](/wiki/Godefroid_Kurth \"Godefroid Kurth\"), who wrote that the Battle of\nPoitiers \"must ever remain one of the great events in the history of the\nworld, as upon its issue depended whether [Christian\nCivilization](/wiki/Christian_Civilization \"Christian Civilization\") should\ncontinue or Islam prevail throughout Europe.\"[52]\n\nGerman historians were especially ardent in their praise of Charles Martel;\n[Schlegel](/wiki/Karl_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Schlegel \"Karl Wilhelm Friedrich\nSchlegel\") speaks of this \"mighty victory\",[53] and tells how \"the arm of\nCharles Martel saved and delivered the Christian nations of the West from the\ndeadly grasp of all-destroying Islam.\" Creasy quotes [Leopold von\nRanke](/wiki/Leopold_von_Ranke \"Leopold von Ranke\")'s opinion that this period\nwas \"one of the most important epochs in the history of the world, the\ncommencement of the eighth century, when on the one side Mohammedanism\nthreatened to overspread Italy and Gaul, and on the other the ancient idolatry\nof [Saxony](/wiki/Saxony \"Saxony\") and [Friesland](/wiki/Friesland\n\"Friesland\") once more forced its way across the Rhine. In this peril of\nChristian institutions, a youthful prince of Germanic race, Karl Martell,\narose as their champion, maintained them with all the energy which the\nnecessity for self-defence calls forth, and finally extended them into new\nregions.\"[53]\n\nThe German military historian [Hans Delbrück](/wiki/Hans_Delbr%C3%BCck \"Hans\nDelbrück\") said of this battle \"there was no more important battle in the\nhistory of the world.\" (_The Barbarian Invasions_ , p. 441.) Had Charles\nMartel failed, [Henry Hallam](/wiki/Henry_Hallam \"Henry Hallam\") argued, there\nwould have been no [Charlemagne](/wiki/Charlemagne \"Charlemagne\"), no [Holy\nRoman Empire](/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire \"Holy Roman Empire\") or [Papal\nStates](/wiki/Papal_States \"Papal States\"); all these depended upon Charles's\ncontainment of Islam from expanding into Europe while the Caliphate was\nunified and able to mount such a conquest. Another great mid era historian,\n[Thomas Arnold](/wiki/Thomas_Arnold \"Thomas Arnold\"), ranked the victory of\nCharles Martel even higher than the victory of [Arminius](/wiki/Arminius\n\"Arminius\") in its impact on all of modern history: \"Charles Martel's victory\nat Tours was among those signal deliverances which have affected for centuries\nthe happiness of mankind.\"[54] Louis Gustave and Charles Strauss in _Moslem\nand Frank; or, Charles Martel and the rescue of Europe_ said \"The victory\ngained was decisive and final, The torrent of Arab conquest was rolled back\nand Europe was rescued from the threatened yoke of the Saracens.\" (p. 122)\n\nCharles Oman, in his _History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages_ ,\nconcludes that \"At Poitiers the Franks fought as they had done two hundred\nyears before at Casilinum, in one solid mass, without breaking rank or\nattempting to maneuver. Their victory was won by the purely defensive tactics\nof the infantry square; the fanatical Arabs, dashing against them time after\ntime, were shattered to pieces, and at last fled under shelter of night. But\nthere was no pursuit, for Charles had determined not to allow his men to stir\na step from the line to chase the broken foe. [I, 58]\"\n\n[John Bagnell Bury](/wiki/J._B._Bury \"J. B. Bury\"), writing at the beginning\nof the 20th century, said \"The Battle of Tours... has often been represented\nas an event of the first magnitude for the world's history, because after\nthis, the penetration of Islam into Europe was finally brought to a\nstandstill.\"[55]\n\nModern Western historians are clearly divided on the importance of the battle,\nand where it should rank in military history; see below.\n\n### Adolf Hitler on the Battle of\nTours[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit\nsection: Adolf Hitler on the Battle of Tours\")]\n\n[Albert Speer](/wiki/Albert_Speer \"Albert Speer\"), Hitler's Armaments\nMinister, described how Hitler expressed approval of Islam, saying that Hitler\nhad been particularly impressed by what he had heard from a delegation of\nArabs. When the Muslims had tried to penetrate Central Europe in the 8th\ncentury, they had been driven back at the Battle of Tours; if they had won\nthat battle, the world would have become Muslim. Theirs was a religion, Hitler\nsaid, that believed in spreading the faith by the sword and subjugating all\nnations to that faith. Hitler considered that Islam was perfectly suited to\nthe \"Germanic\" temperament and would have been more compatible to the Germans\nthan [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity \"Christianity\").[56]\n\n### In Muslim\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit\nsection: In Muslim history\")]\n\nEastern historians, like their Western counterparts, have not always agreed on\nthe importance of the battle. According to [Bernard Lewis](/wiki/Bernard_Lewis\n\"Bernard Lewis\"), \"The Arab historians, if they mention this engagement [the\nBattle of Tours] at all, present it as a minor skirmish,\"[57] and [Gustave von\nGrunebaum](/wiki/Gustave_E._von_Grunebaum \"Gustave E. von Grunebaum\") writes:\n\"This setback may have been important from the European point of view, but for\nMuslims at the time, who saw no master plan imperilled thereby, it had no\nfurther significance.\"[58] Contemporary Arab and Muslim historians and\nchroniclers were much more interested in the [second Umayyad siege of\nConstantinople](/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_\\(718\\) \"Siege of Constantinople\n\\(718\\)\") in 718, which ended in a disastrous defeat.\n\nHowever, Creasy has claimed: \"The enduring importance of the battle of Tours\nin the eyes of the Moslems is attested not only by the expressions of 'the\ndeadly battle' and 'the disgraceful overthrow' which their writers constantly\nemploy when referring to it, but also by the fact that no more serious\nattempts at conquest beyond the [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees \"Pyrenees\") were\nmade by the Saracens.\"\n\nThirteenth-century Moroccan author [Ibn Idhari al-Marrakushi](/wiki/Ibn_Idhari\n\"Ibn Idhari\"), mentioned the battle in his history of the Maghrib, \"_[al-Bayan\nal-Mughrib fi Akhbar al-Maghrib](/wiki/Al-Bayan_al-Mughrib \"Al-Bayan al-\nMughrib\")_.\" According to [Ibn Idhari](/wiki/Ibn_Idhari \"Ibn Idhari\"), \"Abd\nar-Rahman and many of his men found martyrdom on the balat ash-Shuhada'i (\"the\npath of the martyrs).\" Antonio Santosuosso points that \"they (the Muslims)\ncalled the battle's location, the road between Poitiers and Tours, \"the\npavement of Martyrs\".\"[48] However, as [Henry Coppée](/wiki/Henry_Copp%C3%A9e\n\"Henry Coppée\") pointed out, \"The same name was given to the battle of\nToulouse and is applied to many other fields on which the Moslemah were\ndefeated: they were always martyrs for the faith.\"[59]\n\n[Khalid Yahya Blankinship](/wiki/Khalid_Yahya_Blankinship \"Khalid Yahya\nBlankinship\") argued that the military defeat at Tours was one of the failures\nthat contributed to the decline of the Umayyad caliphate: \"Stretching from\nMorocco to China, the Umayyad caliphate based its expansion and success on the\ndoctrine of jihad – armed struggle to claim the whole earth for God's rule, a\nstruggle that had brought much material success for a century but suddenly\nground to a halt followed by the collapse of the ruling Umayyad dynasty in 750\nAD. The End of the Jihad State demonstrates for the first time that the cause\nof this collapse came not just from internal conflict, as has been claimed,\nbut from a number of external and concurrent factors that exceeded the\ncaliphate's capacity to respond. These external factors began with crushing\nmilitary defeats at Byzantium, Toulouse and Tours, which led to the [Berber\nRevolt](/wiki/Berber_Revolt \"Berber Revolt\") of 740 in Iberia and Northern\nAfrica.\"\n\n## Current historical debate on macrohistorical impact of Battle of\nTours[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit\nsection: Current historical debate on macrohistorical impact of Battle of\nTours\")]\n\nSome modern historians argue that the Battle of Tours was of no great\nhistorical significance while others continue to contend that Charles Martel's\nvictory was important in European or even world history.\n\n### Supporting the significance of Tours as a world-altering\nevent[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit\nsection: Supporting the significance of Tours as a world-altering event\")]\n\n[William E. Watson](/wiki/William_E._Watson \"William E.

It signaled\nthe end of the _ghanima_ (booty) economy.\"[64]\n\nMilitary Historian Paul Davis argued in 1999, \"had the Muslims been victorious\nat Tours, it is difficult to suppose what population in Europe could have\norganized to resist them.\"[30] Likewise, George Bruce in his update of\nHarbottle's classic military history _Dictionary of Battles_ maintains that\n\"Charles Martel defeated the Moslem army effectively ending Moslem attempts to\nconquer western Europe.\"[65]\n\nHistory professor [Antonio Santosuosso](/wiki/Antonio_Santosuosso \"Antonio\nSantosuosso\") puts forth an opinion on Charles, Tours, and the subsequent\ncampaigns against Rahman's son in 736–737, presenting that these later defeats\nof invading Muslim armies were at least as important as Tours in their defense\nof Western Christendom and the preservation of Western monasticism, the\nmonasteries of which were the centers of learning which ultimately led Europe\nout of her Middle Ages. He also makes an argument, after studying the Arab\nhistories of the period, that these were clearly armies of invasion, sent by\nthe Caliph not just to avenge Tours, but to begin the end of Christian Europe\nand bring it into the Caliphate.\n\nProfessor of religion [Huston Smith](/wiki/Huston_Smith \"Huston Smith\") says\nin _The World 's Religions: Our Great Wisdom Traditions_ \"But for their defeat\nby Charles Martel in the Battle of Tours in 733, the entire Western world\nmight today be Muslim.\" Historian [Robert Payne](/wiki/Robert_Payne_\\(author\\)\n\"Robert Payne \\(author\\)\") on page 142 in \"_The History of Islam_ \" said \"The\nmore powerful Muslims and the spread of Islam were knocking on Europe's door.\nAnd the spread of Islam was stopped along the road between the towns of Tours\nand Poitiers, France, with just its head in Europe.\"\n\n[Victor Davis Hanson](/wiki/Victor_Davis_Hanson \"Victor Davis Hanson\") has\ncommented that \"Recent scholars have suggested Poitiers, so poorly recorded in\ncontemporary sources, was a mere raid and thus a construct of western\nmythmaking or that a Muslim victory might have been preferable to continued\nFrankish dominance.
