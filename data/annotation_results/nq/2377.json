[Historically](/wiki/Historic_counties_of_England\n\"Historic counties of England\") in Yorkshire's [West\nRiding](/wiki/West_Riding_of_Yorkshire \"West Riding of Yorkshire\"), _Leeds_\ncan be traced to the 5th century name for a wooded area of the [Kingdom of\nElmet](/wiki/Elmet \"Elmet\"). The name has been applied to many administrative\nentities over the centuries. It changed from being the name of a small\nmanorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being\nthe name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th\ncenturies Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool.\n\nDuring the [Industrial Revolution](/wiki/Industrial_Revolution \"Industrial\nRevolution\"), Leeds developed into a major [mill town](/wiki/Mill_town \"Mill\ntown\"); wool was the dominant industry, but [flax](/wiki/Flax \"Flax\"),\nengineering, [iron foundries](/wiki/Iron_foundry \"Iron foundry\"), printing,\nand other industries were important.[6] From being a compact market town in\nthe valley of the [River Aire](/wiki/River_Aire \"River Aire\"), in the 16th\ncentury, Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a\npopulous urban centre by the mid-20th century. Leeds has a population of\naround 781,700 (2016), making it the [third-most populous British\ncity](/wiki/List_of_cities_in_the_United_Kingdom \"List of cities in the United\nKingdom\") after [London](/wiki/London \"London\") and\n[Birmingham](/wiki/Birmingham \"Birmingham\").[7] The city lies within the\nUnited Kingdom's [fourth-most populous urban\narea](/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom \"List of\nmetropolitan areas in the United Kingdom\"), with a population of 2.4\nmillion.[8]\n\nThe economy of Leeds is the most diverse of all of the UK's main employment\ncentres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK\ncity. It also has the highest ratio of private to public sector jobs of all\nthe UK's Core Cities, with 77% of its workforce working in the private sector.\nLeeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area, with 480,000\nin employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015.[4] Leeds is home\nto over 109,000 companies generating 5% of England's total economic output of\n£60.5 billion,[9] and is also ranked as a [gamma world\ncity](/wiki/Global_city#GaWC_study \"Global city\") by the [Globalization and\nWorld Cities Research\nNetwork](/wiki/Globalization_and_World_Cities_Research_Network \"Globalization\nand World Cities Research Network\").[10] Leeds is considered the cultural,\nfinancial and commercial heart of the [West Yorkshire Urban\nArea](/wiki/West_Yorkshire_Urban_Area \"West Yorkshire Urban\nArea\").[11][12][13] Leeds is served by four universities, and has the fourth\nlargest student population in the country and the country's [fourth largest\nurban economy](/wiki/List_of_UK_cities_by_GVA \"List of UK cities by GVA\").[14]\n\nAfter London, Leeds is the largest legal and financial centre in the\nUK,[4][15] with the financial and insurance services industry worth £13\nbillion to the Leeds economy.[4][16][17] with more than 30 national and\ninternational banks located in the city including the only subsidiary office\nof the [Bank of England](/wiki/Bank_of_England \"Bank of England\") in the UK\n.[15] Leeds is also the UK's third largest manufacturing centre with around\n1,800 firms and 39,000 employees, Leeds manufacturing firms account for 8.8%\nof total employment in the city and is worth over £7 billion to the local\neconomy.[18] The largest sub-sectors are engineering, printing and publishing,\nfood and drink, chemicals and medical technology.[19] The city is the home of\nseveral firsts, including the oldest surviving film in existence, _[Roundhay\nGarden Scene](/wiki/Roundhay_Garden_Scene \"Roundhay Garden Scene\")_ (1888) and\nthe 1767 invention of [soda water](/wiki/Soda_water \"Soda water\"), the\ndefining component of most [soft drinks](/wiki/Soft_drink \"Soft\ndrink\").[20][21]\n\nOutside London, Leeds has the third busiest railway station [22] and tenth-\nbusiest airport in terms of passenger numbers in England.[23] Public\ntransport, rail and road communications networks in the region are focused on\nLeeds. Its assigned role in the [Leeds City Region](/wiki/Leeds_City_Region\n\"Leeds City Region\") partnership recognises the city's importance to regional\neconomic development, and the second phase of [High Speed\n2](/wiki/High_Speed_2 \"High Speed 2\") plans to connect Leeds to London via\n[East Midlands Hub](/wiki/East_Midlands_Hub_railway_station \"East Midlands Hub\nrailway station\") and [Sheffield Meadowhall](/wiki/Meadowhall_Interchange\n\"Meadowhall Interchange\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Toponymy\n    * 1.2 Economic development\n    * 1.3 Local government\n    * 1.4 Suburban growth\n  * 2 Geography\n    * 2.1 Climate\n    * 2.2 Green belt\n  * 3 Demography\n    * 3.1 Urban subdivision\n    * 3.2 Metropolitan district\n  * 4 Government\n  * 5 Economy\n    * 5.1 Public sector\n    * 5.2 Shopping\n  * 6 Landmarks\n  * 7 Transport\n  * 8 Recreation\n    * 8.1 Walking\n    * 8.2 Parks and open spaces\n  * 9 Education\n    * 9.1 Schools\n    * 9.2 Further and higher education\n  * 10 Culture\n    * 10.1 Art\n    * 10.2 Carnivals and festivals\n    * 10.3 Cinema\n    * 10.4 Media\n    * 10.5 Museums\n    * 10.6 Music, theatre and dance\n    * 10.7 Nightlife\n  * 11 Sports\n    * 11.1 Leeds teams\n  * 12 Religion\n  * 13 Public services\n  * 14 See also\n  * 15 References and notes\n  * 16 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Leeds&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nMain article: [History of Leeds](/wiki/History_of_Leeds \"History of Leeds\")\n\n### Toponymy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Leeds&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Toponymy\")]\n\nThe name _Leeds_ derives from the old Brythonic word _Ladenses_ meaning\n\"people of the fast-flowing river\", in reference to the [River\nAire](/wiki/River_Aire \"River Aire\") that flows through the city.[24] This\nname originally referred to the forested area covering most of the [Brythonic\nkingdom of Elmet](/wiki/Elmet \"Elmet\"), which existed during the 5th century\ninto the early 7th century.[25]\n\n[Bede](/wiki/Bede \"Bede\") states in the fourteenth chapter of his\n_[Ecclesiastical History](/wiki/Ecclesiastical_History_of_the_English_People\n\"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\")_ , in a discussion of an altar\nsurviving from a church erected by [Edwin of\nNorthumbria](/wiki/Edwin_of_Northumbria \"Edwin of Northumbria\"), that it is\nlocated in _...regione quae vocatur Loidis_ (Latin, \"the region which is\ncalled Loidis\").

[J. M. W.\nTurner](/wiki/J._M._W._Turner \"J. M. W. Turner\") painted numerous scenes in\nand around the city,[134] and the city was home to one of Britain's largest\ncollections of Pre-Raphaelite Art, owned by Thomas Plint, during the\nnineteenth century.[135] There was also an early history of holding larg-scale\npublic exhibitions in the city, most notably the series of 'Polytechnic\nExhibitions' held regularly from 1839.[136]\n\nLeeds produced many notable artists and sculptors, including [Kenneth\nArmitage](/wiki/Kenneth_Armitage \"Kenneth Armitage\"), [John Atkinson\nGrimshaw](/wiki/John_Atkinson_Grimshaw \"John Atkinson Grimshaw\"), [Jacob\nKramer](/wiki/Jacob_Kramer \"Jacob Kramer\"), [Barbara\nHepworth](/wiki/Barbara_Hepworth \"Barbara Hepworth\"), [Henry\nMoore](/wiki/Henry_Moore \"Henry Moore\") and [Edward\nWadsworth](/wiki/Edward_Wadsworth \"Edward Wadsworth\"), and was the centre for\na particularly radical strain of British art. Before the First World War Leeds\nwas the home of an unusual modernist arts organisation, called the [Leeds Arts\nClub](/wiki/Leeds_Arts_Club \"Leeds Arts Club\"), founded by [Alfred\nOrage](/wiki/Alfred_Orage \"Alfred Orage\"), which lasted from 1903 to 1923.\nNotable members included [Jacob Kramer](/wiki/Jacob_Kramer \"Jacob Kramer\"),\n[Herbert Read](/wiki/Herbert_Read \"Herbert Read\"), [Frank\nRutter](/wiki/Frank_Rutter \"Frank Rutter\") and [Michael\nSadler](/wiki/Michael_Sadler_\\(educationist\\) \"Michael Sadler\n\\(educationist\\)\"). As well as advocating a radical political agenda,\nsupporting the [Suffragettes](/wiki/Suffragettes \"Suffragettes\"), the\n[Independent Labour Party](/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party \"Independent Labour\nParty\") and the [Fabian Society](/wiki/Fabian_Society \"Fabian Society\"), and\npromoting the philosophy of [Friedrich Nietzsche](/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche\n\"Friedrich Nietzsche\"), the Leeds Arts Club was almost unique in Britain as\nbeing an exponent of [German Expressionist](/wiki/German_Expressionist \"German\nExpressionist\") ideas about art and culture. As a result, it staged very early\nBritish exhibitions of work by European expressionist artists, such as\n[Wassily Kandinsky](/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky \"Wassily Kandinsky\"), showing\ntheir work in the city as early as 1913,[137] and produced its own English\nExpressionist artists, including Jacob Kramer and Bruce Turner.[138]\n\nIn the 1920s Leeds College of Art was the starting point for the careers of\nthe sculptors [Barbara Hepworth](/wiki/Barbara_Hepworth \"Barbara Hepworth\")\nand [Henry Moore](/wiki/Henry_Moore \"Henry Moore\"), and in the 1950s, and\n1960s it was one of the leading centres for radical art education in Britain\nunder the guidance of artists such as [Harry Thubron](/wiki/Harry_Thubron\n\"Harry Thubron\") and [Tom Hudson](/wiki/Thomas_Hudson_\\(painter\\) \"Thomas\nHudson \\(painter\\)\"), and the art historian [Norbert\nLynton](/wiki/Norbert_Lynton \"Norbert Lynton\"). Their attempts to redefine\nwhat art education should mean in the post-Second World War period led the\nartist [Patrick Heron](/wiki/Patrick_Heron \"Patrick Heron\") to claim in 1971\nin _The Guardian_ newspaper that 'Leeds is the most influential art school in\nEurope since the [Bauhaus](/wiki/Bauhaus \"Bauhaus\")'.[139] This willingness to\npush at the boundaries of acceptable public behaviour from artists was also\nevident in 1966 when Leeds College of Art staged an exhibition of paintings by\nthe Cypriot artist [Stass Paraskos](/wiki/Stass_Paraskos \"Stass Paraskos\"),\nwho taught at the College, which was raided by the police after allegations of\nobscenity.[140]\n\nThis radicalism continued into the 1970s when the higher education component\nof Leeds College of Art was split from the college to form the nucleus of the\nnew multidisciplinary [Leeds Polytechnic](/wiki/Leeds_Polytechnic \"Leeds\nPolytechnic\"), now called [Leeds Beckett\nUniversity](/wiki/Leeds_Beckett_University \"Leeds Beckett University\").\nPerformance art had been taught earlier at Leeds College of Art, notably by\nthe [Fluxus](/wiki/Fluxus \"Fluxus\") artist [Robin Page](/wiki/Robin_Page\n\"Robin Page\") during his time as a tutor there in the mid-1960s, but in 1977 a\nperformance art work hit the national news headlines when the students Pete\nParkin and Derek Wain used an air pistol to shoot a line up of live\n[budgerigars](/wiki/Budgerigars \"Budgerigars\") in front of an audience at\nLeeds Polytechnic.[141]\n\nThe [University of Leeds](/wiki/University_of_Leeds \"University of Leeds\") was\nthe _alma mater_ of [Herbert Read](/wiki/Herbert_Read \"Herbert Read\"), one of\nthe leading international theorists of modern art from the mid-twentieth\ncentury,[142] and also the teaching base for the [Marxist](/wiki/Marxist\n\"Marxist\") art historian [Arnold Hauser](/wiki/Arnold_Hauser \"Arnold Hauser\")\nfrom 1951 to 1985.[143] Partly due to Herbert Read's connection with the\nUniversity, from 1950 to 1970 the University was the host of one of the first\n[artist in residence](/wiki/Artist_in_residence \"Artist in residence\") schemes\nin Britain, using funding from the then owner of [Lund\nHumphries](/wiki/Lund_Humphries \"Lund Humphries\") books, Peter Gregory. The\nGregory Fellowships, as the residencies were known, were given to painters and\nsculptors for up to two years to allow them to develop their own work and\ninfluence the University in any way they saw fit. Amongst those holding the\nfellowships were [Kenneth Armitage](/wiki/Kenneth_Armitage \"Kenneth\nArmitage\"), [Reg Butler](/wiki/Reg_Butler \"Reg Butler\"), [Dennis\nCreffield](/wiki/Dennis_Creffield \"Dennis Creffield\") and [Terry\nFrost](/wiki/Terry_Frost \"Terry Frost\") and others. Parallel Gregory\nFellowships also existed in music and poetry at the University.[144]\n\nLeeds was also a centre for radical feminist art, with one of the first\ngalleries in Britain dedicated to showing the work of women photographers, the\nPavilion Gallery, opening in the city in 1983, and the [University of\nLeeds](/wiki/University_of_Leeds \"University of Leeds\") School of Fine Art\nbeing a well-known centre for the development of feminist art history, under\n[Griselda Pollock](/wiki/Griselda_Pollock \"Griselda Pollock\"), during the\n1980s and 1990s. Possibly as a result of the strength of feminist art in\nLeeds, in November 1984 an exhibition of ceramics by students and staff at\nLeeds Polytechnic was attacked by a group of feminist activists who destroyed\neight sculptures on display which they deemed to be degrading to women.[145]\nThe University of Leeds's School of Fine Art also specialised in [Art and\nLanguage](/wiki/Art_and_Language \"Art and Language\") conceptual art practice,\nunder [Terry Atkinson](/wiki/Terry_Atkinson \"Terry Atkinson\"), again in the\n1980s and 1990s.[146]\n\nA major sculpture research centre and gallery, the [Henry Moore\nInstitute](/wiki/Henry_Moore_Institute \"Henry Moore Institute\"), is located\nalongside [Leeds Art Gallery](/wiki/Leeds_Art_Gallery \"Leeds Art Gallery\") in\nthe city centre, and in 2013 a new contemporary art centre, called [The\nTetley](/wiki/The_Tetley_\\(Leeds\\) \"The Tetley \\(Leeds\\)\"), opened on the site\nof the former Tetley Brewery to the south of the city centre.\n\nIn March 2017, [The Times](/wiki/The_Times \"The Times\") voted Leeds as the\nnumber one cultural place to live in Britain.
