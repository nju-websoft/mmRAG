The king\nwants Jack to guide an expedition to the [Fountain of\nYouth](/wiki/Fountain_of_Youth \"Fountain of Youth\") before [King\nFerdinand](/wiki/Ferdinand_VI_of_Spain \"Ferdinand VI of Spain\") and the\n[Spanish Navy](/wiki/Spanish_Navy \"Spanish Navy\") can locate it. Jack's old\nnemesis, Captain [Hector Barbossa](/wiki/Hector_Barbossa \"Hector Barbossa\"),\nnow a [privateer](/wiki/Privateer \"Privateer\") in service to the [British\nNavy](/wiki/Royal_Navy \"Royal Navy\") after losing his leg and ship, the\n_[Black Pearl](/wiki/Black_Pearl \"Black Pearl\")_ , which he says was sunk, is\nheading the expedition.\n\nJack refuses the offer and escapes. He meets up with his father, [Captain\nTeague](/wiki/Captain_Teague \"Captain Teague\"), who warns Jack about the\nFountain's rituals. Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew\nto find the Fountain. The impostor is\n[Angelica](/wiki/Angelica_\\(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean\\) \"Angelica \\(Pirates of\nthe Caribbean\\)\"), Jack's former lover, and the daughter of the ruthless\npirate [Blackbeard](/wiki/Blackbeard_\\(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean\\) \"Blackbeard\n\\(Pirates of the Caribbean\\)\"), who practices [voodoo](/wiki/Haitian_Vodou\n\"Haitian Vodou\") magic and wields the mythical \"Sword of\n[Triton](/wiki/Triton_\\(mythology\\) \"Triton \\(mythology\\)\")\" that controls his\nship, the _[Queen Anne's Revenge](/wiki/Queen_Anne%27s_Revenge \"Queen Anne's\nRevenge\")_. While Jack is [shanghaied](/wiki/Shanghaiing \"Shanghaiing\") aboard\nBlackbeard's ship, Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack's\nmap showing the Fountain's location, forcing Barbossa to take him along.\n\nMeanwhile, after a failed [mutiny](/wiki/Mutiny \"Mutiny\") aboard the _Queen\nAnne 's Revenge_, Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain. Blackbeard\nseeks the Fountain's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with\na \"one-legged man\", who happened to be Barbossa. Jack must find two silver\nchalices aboard [Juan Ponce de León](/wiki/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n \"Juan Ponce\nde León\")'s missing flagship, the _Santiago_. The Fountain's water must\nsimultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices. Drinking from one\nchalice containing a [mermaid](/wiki/Mermaid \"Mermaid\")'s tear will extend\nlife; the second person dies, their remaining years of life transferred to the\nother drinker. Jack also discovers that the _Black Pearl_ was captured and\nshrunk before being added to Blackbeard's collection of other shrunken [ships\nin bottles](/wiki/Ship_in_a_bottle \"Ship in a bottle\").\n\nThe _Queen Anne 's Revenge_ heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid\ntears. After managing to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other\nmermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion that scares them\naway. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive\nmissionary, falls in love with her. Reaching Ponce de León's ship on an\nuncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both\nchalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa\nthere. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are\nnowhere to be found on the vessel.\n\nJack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the\nchalices. Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for\nattacking the _Black Pearl_ , and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa\nescape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, reciprocating Philip's love, is\ntricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of\ndehydration while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the\nchalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's\nconfiscated magical compass (which they took from him before sending him to\nget the chalices), and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard\nthe chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set\nfree with the compass.\n\nAt the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and\nthey battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish suddenly arrive,\nintending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against\nGod. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs\nBlackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and\npoisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching\nthe swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and\ngains control of the _Queen Anne 's Revenge_ and her crew. Despite resistance\nfrom Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing\nthe Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins.\nPhilip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack\nretrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste\nher tear. Syrena goes back to the dying Philip. She says she can save him if\nhe asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him\nunderwater.\n\nWith Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack retrieves the last\nremaining drops of water from the destroyed fountain and puts the tear in one\nof them. Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica to\ndrink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it,\nasking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second\nchalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake\nabout which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they\nboth believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as\nthe Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body.\n\nEventually, Jack and Angelica admit their love for each other, yet he\ndistrusts her intentions (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and\nstrands her on a [cay](/wiki/Cay \"Cay\"). Now wielding Blackbeard's magical\nsword, Barbossa captains the _Queen Anne 's Revenge_ and returns to piracy.\nJack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the _Revenge_. He\nreclaims the shrunken _Black Pearl_ and the other conquered ships in bottles,\ncarrying them in a [gunny sack](/wiki/Gunny_sack \"Gunny sack\"). The two leave,\nhoping to revert the _Black Pearl_ to its original size and continue living\nthe pirates life.\n\nIn a [post-credits scene](/wiki/Post-credits_scene \"Post-credits scene\"), a\nvoodoo doll of Jack crafted by Blackbeard washes ashore and is found by\nAngelica, who then smiles.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_On_Stranger_Tides&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Pirates of the Caribbean\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_characters \"List of Pirates\nof the Caribbean characters\")\n\n  * [Johnny Depp](/wiki/Johnny_Depp \"Johnny Depp\") as Captain [Jack Sparrow](/wiki/Jack_Sparrow \"Jack Sparrow\"): Former captain of the _[Black Pearl](/wiki/Black_Pearl \"Black Pearl\")_.\n  * [Penélope Cruz](/wiki/Pen%C3%A9lope_Cruz \"Penélope Cruz\") as [Angelica](/wiki/Angelica_\\(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean\\) \"Angelica \\(Pirates of the Caribbean\\)\"): Jack's former love interest, and daughter of Blackbeard.\n  * [Geoffrey Rush](/wiki/Geoffrey_Rush \"Geoffrey Rush\") as Captain [Hector Barbossa](/wiki/Hector_Barbossa \"Hector Barbossa\"): Jack's former-rival-turned-ally, and former captain of the _Black Pearl_.\n  * [Ian McShane](/wiki/Ian_McShane \"Ian McShane\") as Captain [Blackbeard](/wiki/Blackbeard_\\(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean\\) \"Blackbeard \\(Pirates of the Caribbean\\)\"): Legendary pirate, and captain of the _[Queen Anne's Revenge](/wiki/Queen_Anne%27s_Revenge \"Queen Anne's Revenge\")_.\n  * [Kevin McNally](/wiki/Kevin_McNally \"Kevin McNally\") as [Joshamee Gibbs](/wiki/Joshamee_Gibbs \"Joshamee Gibbs\"): Jack's friend, and former first mate.\n  * [Sam Claflin](/wiki/Sam_Claflin \"Sam Claflin\") as [Philip Swift](/wiki/Philip_Swift \"Philip Swift\"): A missionary, kept prisoner aboard Blackbeard's ship.\n  * [Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey](/wiki/%C3%80strid_Berg%C3%A8s-Frisbey \"Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey\") as [Syrena](/wiki/Syrena_\\(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean\\) \"Syrena \\(Pirates of the Caribbean\\)\"): A mermaid captured by Blackbeard, and love interest of Swift.\n  * [Stephen Graham](/wiki/Stephen_Graham_\\(actor\\) \"Stephen Graham \\(actor\\)\") as Scrum: A self-serving member of Blackbeard's crew.\n  * [Greg Ellis](/wiki/Greg_Ellis_\\(actor\\) \"Greg Ellis \\(actor\\)\") as Lt.

He hoped [Gore\nVerbinski](/wiki/Gore_Verbinski \"Gore Verbinski\") would return to direct the\nfourth film, as his _[BioShock](/wiki/BioShock#Canceled_film \"BioShock\")_ film\nadaptation had been put on hold.[7] As Verbinski was unavailable due to his\ncommitment with _[Rango](/wiki/Rango_\\(2011_film\\) \"Rango \\(2011 film\\)\")_ the\nsame year, Bruckheimer suggested [Rob Marshall](/wiki/Rob_Marshall \"Rob\nMarshall\"), who he considered a \"premiere filmmaker\", stating that \"Every film\n[Marshall] made I thought was unique and different.\"[8] On July 21, 2009,\nMarshall accepted the job, because of the \"whole new story line and set of\ncharacters. It felt new, and that was important to me.\"[6] Marshall said the\nfilm provided him a long-awaited opportunity to work with Depp, and that his\ndirecting was helped by his experience as a choreographer—\"the action\nsequences felt like big production numbers.\"[9] On September 11, 2009, at\nDisney's [D23](/wiki/D23_\\(Disney\\) \"D23 \\(Disney\\)\") convention during a\nDisney event, Cook and Johnny Depp, in full Captain Jack Sparrow costume,\nannounced that a fourth _Pirates_ film was in development. The title was\nannounced as _Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides_.[10] Marshall\nvisited the [Pirates of the Caribbean\nride](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_\\(attraction\\) \"Pirates of the Caribbean\n\\(attraction\\)\") in Disneyland for inspiration, eventually paying homage with\na skeleton holding a magnifying glass in Ponce de León's ship. An appearance\nof \"Old Bill\", the pirate who tries to share his rum with a cat, was also\nfilmed but cut.[11] [Pintel and Ragetti](/wiki/Pintel_and_Ragetti \"Pintel and\nRagetti\") were originally supposed to make an appearance, but director Rob\nMarshall opted out of the idea as he feared their roles would be cut.[12]\n\nCook resigned in September 2009 after working for Disney for over 38\nyears.[13] Depp's faith in _Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides_ was\nsomewhat shaken after the resignation, with Depp explaining that \"There's a\nfissure, a crack in my enthusiasm at the moment. It was all born in that\noffice\".[14] Depp also explained Cook was one of the few who accepted his\nportrayal of Jack Sparrow: \"When things went a little sideways on the [first\n_Pirates_ movie](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_The_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\") and others at the\nstudio were less than enthusiastic about my interpretation of the character,\nDick was there from the first moment. He trusted me\".[14]\n\n###\nWriting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_On_Stranger_Tides&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Writing\")]\n\nDuring production of _[Dead Man's\nChest](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_Dead_Man%27s_Chest \"Pirates of the\nCaribbean: Dead Man's Chest\")_ and _At World 's End_, writers [Ted\nElliott](/wiki/Ted_Elliott_\\(screenwriter\\) \"Ted Elliott \\(screenwriter\\)\")\nand [Terry Rossio](/wiki/Terry_Rossio \"Terry Rossio\") discovered [Tim\nPowers](/wiki/Tim_Powers \"Tim Powers\")' 1987 novel _[On Stranger\nTides](/wiki/On_Stranger_Tides \"On Stranger Tides\")_ , which they considered a\ngood foundation on which to base \"a new chapter\" in the _Pirates_ series.[8]\nDisney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007.[15] Rossio stated that he\nand Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the\nstory before reading the book, \"but whenever you say those words, Powers'\nnovel comes to mind. There was no way we could work in that field without\ngoing into territory Tim had explored.\" However, they denied that it would be\na straight version of the novel: \"Blackbeard came from the book, and in the\nbook there is a daughter character, too. But Jack Sparrow is not in the book,\nnor is Barbossa. So I wouldn't call this an adaptation.\"[6] Rossio declared\nthe script was written to be a standalone film, \"kind of a _[James\nBond](/wiki/James_Bond_in_film \"James Bond in film\")_ sort of thing\", instead\nof the \"designed to be a trilogy\" structure of the previous installments.[16]\nThey hoped to \"design a story that would support new characters,\" as\ncharacters such as [Will Turner](/wiki/Will_Turner \"Will Turner\") would not\nreturn.[17] Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to \"streamline the\nstory a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters\nto follow\", as the number of characters and subplots in _At World 's End_\ncaused the film to have an unwieldy length.[8] The duo decided to employ\nanother sea myth alluded in the previous episodes: mermaids,[16] which are\nbriefly referenced in the book. The mermaids' role expanded in the script,\nwhich included a vast attack sequence.[17]\n\nDepp was deeply involved with the story design, frequently meeting the writers\nto show what he was interested in doing, and in the words of Rossio, being\n\"involved in coming up with story lines, connecting characters, creating\nmoments that we would then fashion, shape and then go back.\"[16] Among Depp's\nsuggestions were turning Phillip into a missionary and having a Spanish\ncontingent following the protagonists. Afterwards, Rob Marshall and executive\nproducer John DeLuca met Rossio and Elliot, and did alterations of their own,\nincluding building the female lead.[17]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_On_Stranger_Tides&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\n[![Johnny Depp in a film\npremiere.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Johnny_Depp_2%2C_2011.jpg/175px-\nJohnny_Depp_2%2C_2011.jpg)](/wiki/File:Johnny_Depp_2,_2011.jpg)\n\n[![Geoffrey Rush in a\nfestival.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/GeoffreyRushTIFFSept2011.jpg/175px-\nGeoffreyRushTIFFSept2011.jpg)](/wiki/File:GeoffreyRushTIFFSept2011.jpg)\n\n[![Kevin\nMcNally.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Kevin_McNally.jpg/175px-\nKevin_McNally.jpg)](/wiki/File:Kevin_McNally.jpg)\n\nTop to bottom: [Johnny Depp](/wiki/Johnny_Depp \"Johnny Depp\"), [Geoffrey\nRush](/wiki/Geoffrey_Rush \"Geoffrey Rush\"), and [Kevin\nMcNally](/wiki/Kevin_McNally \"Kevin McNally\") who reprised their roles from\nthe previous films as Captain Jack Sparrow, Captain Hector Barbossa, and\nJoshamee Gibbs respectively.\n\nDepp signed on to return as Captain Jack Sparrow in September 2008, saying\nthat he would come back if the script was good.[18] Almost a year later,\nDisney announced that Depp would be paid $55.5 million for his role, realizing\nthat without him the franchise would be \"dead and buried.\"[19] [Geoffrey\nRush](/wiki/Geoffrey_Rush \"Geoffrey Rush\") expressed interest in returning to\nhis role as Barbossa,[20] and Bruckheimer later confirmed his presence.[21]\nRush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the\ndisability made him \"angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character\", and\nhad to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and\nusage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes.[22] While the\nproduction team considered a prop [pegleg](/wiki/Pegleg \"Pegleg\") to be put\nover Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a [blue sock\nthat was replaced digitally](/wiki/Chroma_key \"Chroma key\"), with a knob on\nthe shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk.[23] Three other actors from\nthe previous films returned, [Kevin McNally](/wiki/Kevin_McNally \"Kevin\nMcNally\") as [Joshamee Gibbs](/wiki/Joshamee_Gibbs \"Joshamee Gibbs\"), [Greg\nEllis](/wiki/Greg_Ellis_\\(actor\\) \"Greg Ellis \\(actor\\)\") as Lt.

She needed to be funny and clever and smart and crafty\nand beautiful\",[9] and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production\nof _[Nine](/wiki/Nine_\\(2009_live-action_film\\) \"Nine \\(2009 live-action\nfilm\\)\")_.[23] The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing\nfor the role.[35] During filming, Cruz discovered she was pregnant, leading\nthe costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic,[23] and\nthe producers to hire her sister [Mónica Cruz](/wiki/M%C3%B3nica_Cruz \"Mónica\nCruz\") to double for Penélope in risky scenes.[36] Depp recommended [Stephen\nGraham](/wiki/Stephen_Graham_\\(actor\\) \"Stephen Graham \\(actor\\)\"), who worked\nwith him in _[Public Enemies](/wiki/Public_Enemies_\\(2009_film\\) \"Public\nEnemies \\(2009 film\\)\")_ , to play Scrum, a Machiavellian pirate and sidekick\nto Jack Sparrow,[37][38] and [Richard Griffiths](/wiki/Richard_Griffiths\n\"Richard Griffiths\") for the role of [King George\nII](/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain \"George II of Great Britain\"), as Depp\nwas a fan of Griffiths' work on _[Withnail and I](/wiki/Withnail_and_I\n\"Withnail and I\")_.[23] [Sam Claflin](/wiki/Sam_Claflin \"Sam Claflin\"), a\nrecent drama school graduate with television experience, was chosen to play\nthe missionary Philip,[39] and British actor [Paul Bazely](/wiki/Paul_Bazely\n\"Paul Bazely\") also joined the cast.[40] Spanish news website _[El\nPais](/wiki/El_Pais \"El Pais\")_ reported that the film had four Spanish\nactors: Cruz, Bergès-Frisbey, Óscar Jaenada, and [Juan Carlos\nVellido](/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Vellido \"Juan Carlos Vellido\").[41] Jaenada was\npicked for both his work in _[The Losers](/wiki/The_Losers_\\(film\\) \"The\nLosers \\(film\\)\")_ and a recommendation by Cruz.[42]\n\nCasting for mermaids required the actresses to have natural breasts—no\n[implants](/wiki/Breast_implant \"Breast implant\"). As Bruckheimer explained to\n_[EW](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment Weekly\")_ , \"I don't think\nthey had breast augmentation in the 1700s, [...] So it's natural for casting\npeople to say, 'We want real people.'\"[43] Marshall invited Spanish-French\nactress [Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey](/wiki/%C3%80strid_Berg%C3%A8s-Frisbey \"Àstrid\nBergès-Frisbey\") to play Syrena after seeing her in a French magazine article\non up-and-coming actresses.[22] Bergès-Frisbey had to take lessons of English,\nswimming and breath control for the role.[44] The rest of the mermaid\nportrayers, such as Australian supermodel [Gemma Ward](/wiki/Gemma_Ward \"Gemma\nWard\"),[45] were chosen for having \"exotic sense, an otherworldly sensibility,\nbut also under those layers a deadly quality\", according to Marshall, and had\nto take swimming lessons to learn movements such as the\n[dolphin](/wiki/Butterfly_stroke \"Butterfly stroke\") and [eggbeater\nkicks](/wiki/Eggbeater_kick \"Eggbeater kick\").[46]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_On_Stranger_Tides&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\nbegan on June 14, 2010, in Hawaii.[17][47] Filming was moved to California in\nAugust 2010,[48] primarily at the [Long Beach](/wiki/Long_Beach,_California\n\"Long Beach, California\") shore[33] and a recreation of Whitecap Bay done in\nthe [Universal Studios](/wiki/Universal_Studios \"Universal Studios\")\nbacklot,[17] as the original Hawaiian location on [Halona\nCove](/wiki/Halona_Blowhole#Halona_Cove \"Halona Blowhole\") was plagued with\nstrong tides.[22] After a brief shoot in [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico\n\"Puerto Rico\"),[33] with locations in both [Palomino\nIsland](/wiki/Isla_Palominos_\\(Puerto_Rico\\) \"Isla Palominos \\(Puerto Rico\\)\")\nand the [Fort of San\nCristóbal](/wiki/Castillo_de_San_Crist%C3%B3bal_\\(Puerto_Rico\\) \"Castillo de\nSan Cristóbal \\(Puerto Rico\\)\") in [San Juan](/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico \"San\nJuan, Puerto Rico\"),[49] production moved to the United Kingdom in September,\nwhere principal photography wrapped on November 18 after 106 days of\nshooting.[17] Locations included [Hampton Court\nPalace](/wiki/Hampton_Court_Palace \"Hampton Court Palace\") in London,[23]\n[Knole House](/wiki/Knole_House \"Knole House\") in [Kent](/wiki/Kent\n\"Kent\"),[33] and [Old Royal Naval College](/wiki/Old_Royal_Naval_College \"Old\nRoyal Naval College\") at [Greenwich](/wiki/Greenwich \"Greenwich\").[50]\nInteriors were shot at London's [Pinewood Studios](/wiki/Pinewood_Studios\n\"Pinewood Studios\"), and a replica of an 18th-century London street was built\non the backlot alongside the soundstages.[33][51] The producers also\nconsidered using [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\") as a\nlocation.[52] In October, security was breached at the UK site when a\n[celebrity impersonator](/wiki/Celebrity_impersonator \"Celebrity\nimpersonator\") gained access to filming at the Old Royal Naval College by\ndressing up as Captain Jack.[53]\n\nAfter the joint production of _Dead Man 's Chest_ and _At World 's End_ cost\nover $300 million, Disney decided to give a lower budget to the fourth\ninstallment.[54] Many costs had to be cut, including moving primary production\nto Hawaii and London, where tax credits are more favorable, and having a\nshorter shooting schedule and fewer scenes featuring special effects compared\nto _At World 's End_.[55] The tighter schedule—according to Bruckheimer, \"We\nhad a 22-week post, and for a picture like this, with almost 1,200 visual\neffects shots, it's usually 40 weeks\"—meant that Marshall supervised editing\nof sequences during filming.[17] The British financial statements of the film\nrevealed total expenditures of £240.7 million ($410.6 million) by 2013, with\nDisney receiving a rebate of $32.1 million from the British government, making\n_Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides_ the [most expensive film ever\nmade](/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films \"List of most expensive films\") to\ndate.[2]\n\nBruckheimer said the decision to film in 3D was made due to its being\n\"immersive filmmaking; I think it makes you part of the actual filming because\nyou're part of the screen.\" Bruckheimer described it as the first major\n\"exterior movie\" to be shot in 3D, as _[Avatar](/wiki/Avatar_\\(2009_film\\)\n\"Avatar \\(2009 film\\)\")_ was mostly done in sound stages.[8] At first Marshall\nwas not much interested in 3D, but the director eventually considered it a\nfilm that could benefit from the format. \"You are on an adventure and with the\n3D experience you are inside that adventure.\"[9] While the original plan was\nto add 3D effects during post-production, the decision was made to shoot\ndigitally with 3D cameras. Only one sequence was shot conventionally and\nneeded a [3D conversion](/wiki/2D_to_3D_conversion \"2D to 3D conversion\").[8]\nThe cameras were improved versions of the ones [James\nCameron](/wiki/James_Cameron \"James Cameron\") developed for _Avatar_ , which\nwere made more compact for extra mobility. This meant the cameras could be\nbrought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle.[56]\n\nThe _Queen Anne 's Revenge_ was built atop the _Sunset_ , the same ship used\nto depict the _Black Pearl_ in previous installments. On February 2010, the\n_Sunset_ was sailed from Long Beach to a shipyard in Hawaii for the reforms,\nwhere a big concern was to make it imposing, with three stories, without\nsacrificing actual [seakeeping](/wiki/Seakeeping \"Seakeeping\"). Given\nBlackbeard was meant to be the meanest pirate to appear in the series, the\nlook for the _Queen Anne 's Revenge_ was ominous, with sails dyed blood red,\nvarious elements on fire, and a decoration based on skulls and bones (drawing\ninspiration from the [Sedlec Ossuary](/wiki/Sedlec_Ossuary \"Sedlec Ossuary\")\nin Czech Republic). Damage from cannon fire was also added to show that \"not\nonly Blackbeard was a dying man, but his ship is also a dying ship\". The\nship's [figurehead](/wiki/Figurehead \"Figurehead\") also drew inspiration from\nBlackbeard's [pirate flag](/wiki/Jolly_Roger \"Jolly Roger\").[57] The replica\nship [HMS _Surprise_](/wiki/HMS_Surprise_\\(replica_ship\\) \"HMS Surprise\n\\(replica ship\\)\") was used for Barbossa's ship, the HMS _Providence_ ,[58]\nand all the scenes aboard the _Providence_ were shot on the Long Beach shore\nas the _Surprise_ could not be sailed to Hawaii.[23] Over 50 designs were\nconsidered for the Fountain of Youth, with the final one representing a temple\nbuilt by an ancient civilization around the Fountain, which itself was located\nin a round rocky structure to represent \"the circle of life\". The locations\nleading up to the Fountain were shot in the Hawaiian islands of\n[Kauai](/wiki/Kauai \"Kauai\") and [Oahu](/wiki/Oahu \"Oahu\"), but the Fountain\nitself was built at the [007 Stage](/wiki/007_Stage \"007 Stage\") on\nPinewood.[59]\n\n###\nEffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_On_Stranger_Tides&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Effects\")]\n\n_On Stranger Tides_ employed 1,112 shots of [computer-generated\nimagery](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-generated imagery\"),[17]\nwhich were done by ten visual effects companies.[60] [Cinesite](/wiki/Cinesite\n\"Cinesite\") visual effects supervisor Simon Stanley-Clamp claimed that the\nmost difficult part was doing the effects in 3D:\n\"[Rotoscoping](/wiki/Rotoscoping \"Rotoscoping\") is tricky. Cleaning up plates\nis double the work, and [tracking](/wiki/Match_moving \"Match moving\") has to\nbe spot on.\"[50] The lead companies, with over 300 effects each, were\n[Industrial Light & Magic](/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic \"Industrial Light\n& Magic\")—responsible for, among others, the mermaids and most water\neffects[61]—and [Moving Picture Company](/wiki/Moving_Picture_Company \"Moving\nPicture Company\"), who created digital ships and environment extensions, such\nas changing weather and designing cliffs and waterfalls.[62] Filming the\nmermaids involved eight model-actresses, who portrayed them outside the water,\nas well as 22 [synchronized swimming](/wiki/Synchronized_swimming\n\"Synchronized swimming\") athletes and a group of stuntwomen, both of whom wore\n[motion capture](/wiki/Motion_capture \"Motion capture\") suits to be later\nreplaced by digital mermaids. Mermaid corpses were depicted by plaster\nmodels.[33][46] The design tried to avoid the traditional representations of\nmermaids in paintings and literature, instead going for a scaly body with a\ntranslucent membrane inspired by both jellyfish and the fabric employed in\n[ballet tutus](/wiki/Ballet_tutu \"Ballet tutu\").
