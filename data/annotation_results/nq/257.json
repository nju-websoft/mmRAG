(Translation of warning message in French:\nFLIGHT RECORDER DO NOT OPEN) The warning appears in English on the other side.\n\nA **flight recorder** , commonly known as a **black box** , although it is now\norange-coloured, is an electronic recording device placed in an\n[aircraft](/wiki/Aircraft \"Aircraft\") for the purpose of facilitating the\ninvestigation of [aviation accidents and\nincidents](/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents \"Aviation accidents and\nincidents\").\n\nThe **flight data recorder** (**FDR**) is a device that preserves the recent\nhistory of the flight through the recording of dozens of parameters collected\nseveral times per second. The **cockpit voice recorder** (**CVR**) preserves\nthe recent history of the sounds in the cockpit, including the conversation of\nthe pilots. The two recorders give an accurate testimony, narrating the\naircraft's flight history, to assist in any later investigation.\n\nThe FDR and CVR may be combined in a single unit. The two recorders are\nrequired by international regulation, overseen by the [International Civil\nAviation Organization](/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization\n\"International Civil Aviation Organization\"), to be capable of surviving the\nconditions likely to be encountered in a severe aircraft accident. For this\nreason, they are typically specified to withstand an impact of 3400\n[_g_](/wiki/G-force \"G-force\") and temperatures of over 1,000 °C (1,830 °F) as\nrequired by [EUROCAE](/wiki/EUROCAE \"EUROCAE\") ED-112. They have been required\nin commercial aircraft in the US since 1967.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Early designs\n    * 1.2 Australia\n    * 1.3 United States\n  * 2 Terminology\n  * 3 Components\n    * 3.1 Flight data recorder\n    * 3.2 Cockpit voice recorder\n    * 3.3 Combined units\n    * 3.4 Additional equipment\n  * 4 Specifications\n  * 5 Regulation\n    * 5.1 Proposed requirements\n      * 5.1.1 Deployable recorders\n      * 5.1.2 Image recorders\n    * 5.2 After Malaysia Airlines Flight 370\n    * 5.3 After Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501\n  * 6 Cultural references\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 Further reading\n  * 10 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n![File:ABC Black\nBox.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/ABC_Black_Box.ogv/220px\n--ABC_Black_Box.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/ABC_Black_Box.ogv \"Play\nmedia\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:ABC_Black_Box.ogv \"Enlarge\")\n\n1985 [ABC](/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation \"Australian Broadcasting\nCorporation\") news report interviewing [David\nWarren](/wiki/David_Warren_\\(inventor\\) \"David Warren \\(inventor\\)\") about his\ninvention\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/2002-dmuseum-\nluftfahrt-014-650.jpg/220px-2002-dmuseum-\nluftfahrt-014-650.jpg)](/wiki/File:2002-dmuseum-luftfahrt-014-650.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:2002-dmuseum-luftfahrt-014-650.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCockpit voice recorder (on display in the [Deutsches\nMuseum](/wiki/Deutsches_Museum \"Deutsches Museum\")). This is a magnetic tape\nunit built to an old standard [TSO](/wiki/Technical_Standard_Order \"Technical\nStandard Order\") C84 as shown on the nameplate. The text on the side in French\nsays \"flight recorder do not open\"\n\n### Early\ndesigns[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Early designs\")]\n\nOne of the earliest and proven attempts was made by [François\nHussenot](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Hussenot \"François Hussenot\") and Paul Beaudouin\nin 1939 at the [Marignane](/wiki/Marignane \"Marignane\") flight test center,\nFrance, with their \"type HB\" flight recorder; they were essentially\nphotograph-based flight recorders, because the record was made on a scrolling\neight meters long by 88 milimeters wide [photographic\nfilm](/wiki/Photographic_film \"Photographic film\"). The [latent\nimage](/wiki/Latent_image \"Latent image\") was made by a thin ray of light\ndeviated by a mirror tilted according to the magnitude of the data to record\n(altitude, speed, etc.).[1][2] A pre-production run of 25 \"HB\" recorders was\nordered in 1941 and HB recorders remained in use in French test centers well\ninto the seventies.[3] In 1947, Hussenot founded the Société Française des\nInstruments de Mesure with Beaudouin and another associate, so as to market\nhis invention, which was also known as the \"hussenograph\". This company went\non to become a major supplier of data recorders, used not only aboard aircraft\nbut also trains and other vehicles. SFIM is today part of the\n[Safran](/wiki/Safran \"Safran\") group and is still present on the flight\nrecorder market. The advantage of the film technology was that it could be\neasily developed afterwards and provides a durable, visual feedback of the\nflight parameters without needing any playback device. On the other hand,\nunlike magnetic bands or later flash memory-based technology, a photographic\nfilm cannot be erased and recycled, and so it must be changed periodically. As\nsuch, this technology was reserved for one-shot uses, mostly during planned\ntest flights; and it was not mounted aboard civilian aircraft during routine\ncommercial flights. Also, the cockpit conversation was not recorded.\n\nAnother form of flight data recorder was developed in the UK during World War\nII. Len Harrison and Vic Husband developed a unit that could withstand a crash\nand fire to keep the flight data intact. This unit used copper foil as the\nrecording medium with various styli indicating various instruments / aircraft\ncontrols which indented the copper foil. The copper foil was periodically\nadvanced at set periods of time therefore giving a history of the instruments\n/ control settings of the aircraft. This unit was developed at\n[Farnborough](/wiki/Farnborough,_Hampshire \"Farnborough, Hampshire\") for the\n[Ministry of Aircraft Production](/wiki/Ministry_of_Aircraft_Production\n\"Ministry of Aircraft Production\"). At the war's end the Ministry got Harrison\nand Husband to sign over their invention to them and the Ministry patented it\nunder British patent 19330/45. This unit was the forerunner of today's black\nboxes being able to withstand conditions that aircrew could not.\n\nThe first modern flight recorder, called \"Mata Hari\", was created in 1942 by\n[Finnish](/wiki/Finns \"Finns\") aviation engineer Veijo Hietala. This black\nhigh-tech mechanical box was able to record all important aviation details\nduring test flights of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\")\n[fighter aircraft](/wiki/Fighter_aircraft \"Fighter aircraft\") that the Finnish\narmy repaired or built in their main aviation factory in\n[Tampere](/wiki/Tampere \"Tampere\"), [Finland](/wiki/Finland \"Finland\"). The\n\"Mata Hari\" black box is displayed in the [Vapriikki\nMuseum](/w/index.php?title=Vapriikki_Museum&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Vapriikki\nMuseum \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n([fi](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museokeskus_Vapriikki \"fi:Museokeskus\nVapriikki\")) in Tampere, Finland.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Australia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Australia\")]\n\nIn 1953, [Australian](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") engineer [David\nWarren](/wiki/David_Warren_\\(inventor\\) \"David Warren \\(inventor\\)\") conceived\na device that would record not only the instruments reading, but also the\ncockpit voices, when working with the Australian Research Laboratories.[4] He\nbuilt the first prototype in 1958.[5]\n\nWarren, when working with the [Defence Science and Technology\nOrganisations](/wiki/Defence_Science_and_Technology_Organisation \"Defence\nScience and Technology Organisation\")' Aeronautical Research Laboratory\n(Melbourne, Australia),[6] published a 1954 report entitled \"A Device for\nAssisting Investigation into Aircraft Accidents\" and built a\n[prototype](/wiki/Prototype \"Prototype\") FDR called \"The ARL Flight Memory\nUnit\" in 1957. The first coupled FDR / CVR prototype designed with civilian\naircraft in mind, for explicit post-crash examination purposes, was produced\nin 1958.[7][8] However, [aviation](/wiki/Aviation \"Aviation\") authorities from\naround the world were largely uninterested. This changed in 1958 when Sir\nRobert Hardingham, the [Secretary](/wiki/Secretary \"Secretary\") of the British\n[Air Registration Board](/wiki/Air_Registration_Board \"Air Registration\nBoard\"), visited the ARL and was introduced to Warren.\n\nThe Aeronautical Research Laboratory allocated Warren an engineering team to\ndevelop the prototype to airborne stage. The team, consisting of electronics\nengineers Lane Sear, Wally Boswell and Ken Fraser developed a working design\nincorporating a fire and shockproof case, a reliable system for encoding and\nrecording aircraft instrument readings and voice on one wire, and a ground-\nbased decoding device. The ARL system became the \"Red Egg\", made by the\n[British](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") firm of S. Davall & Sons,\nLtd., of [Greenford](/wiki/Greenford \"Greenford\"), Middlesex. The \"Red Egg\"\ngot its name from its shape and bright red color.\n\nIn 1965 the units were redesigned and moved to the rear of airplanes to\nimprove the probability of successful data retrieval after a crash.\n\n### United\nStates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: United States\")]\n\nThe \"Flight Recorder\" was invented and patented in the United States by\nProfessor James J. \"Crash\" Ryan, a professor of mechanical engineering at the\n[University of Minnesota](/wiki/University_of_Minnesota \"University of\nMinnesota\") from 1931 to 1963. Ryan's \"Flight Recorder\" patent was filed in\nAugust 1953 and approved on November 8, 1960; see US Patent 2,959,459.[9] A\nsecond patent by Ryan for a \"Coding Apparatus For Flight Recorders and the\nLike\" is US Patent 3,075,192[10] dated January 22, 1963. An early prototype of\nthe Ryan Flight Data Recorder is described in the January 2013 _Aviation\nHistory Magazine_ article \"Father of the Black Box\" by Scott M. Fisher.[11]\nRyan, also the inventor of the retractable safety [seat belt](/wiki/Seat_belt\n\"Seat belt\") now required in automobiles, began working on the idea of a\nflight recorder in 1946, and invented the device in response to the 1948\nrequest from the [Civil Aeronautics Board](/wiki/Civil_Aeronautics_Board\n\"Civil Aeronautics Board\") for development of a flight recorder as a means of\naccumulating data that could be used to get information useful in arriving at\noperating procedures designed to reduce air mishaps. The original device was\nknown as the \"General Mills Flight Recorder\". The benefits of the flight\nrecorder and the coding apparatus for flight recorders were outlined by Ryan\nin his study entitled \"Economies in Airline Operation with Flight Recorders\"\nwhich was entered into the Congressional Record in 1956. Ryan's Flight\nRecorder maintained a continuing recording of aircraft flight data such as\nengine exhaust, temperature, fuel flow, aircraft velocity, altitude, control\nsurfaces positions, and rate of descent.\n\nA \"Cockpit Sound Recorder\" (CSR) was independently invented and patented by\nEdmund A. Boniface, Jr., an aeronautical engineer at [Lockheed Aircraft\nCorporation](/wiki/Lockheed_Aircraft_Corporation \"Lockheed Aircraft\nCorporation\").[12][13][14] He originally filed with the US Patent Office on\nFebruary 2, 1961, as an \"Aircraft Cockpit Sound Recorder\".[15] The 1961\ninvention was viewed by some as an \"invasion of privacy\". Subsequently\nBoniface filed again on February 4, 1963 for a \"Cockpit Sound Recorder\" (US\nPatent 3,327,067)[12] with the addition of a spring-loaded switch which\nallowed the pilot to erase the audio/sound tape recording at the conclusion of\na safe flight and landing. Boniface's participation in aircraft crash\ninvestigations in the 1940s[16] and in the accident investigations of the loss\nof one of the wings at cruise altitude on each of two Lockheed Electra\nturboprop powered aircraft (Flight #542 operated by [Braniff\nAirlines](/wiki/Braniff_Airlines \"Braniff Airlines\") in 1959 and Flight #710\noperated by [Northwest Orient Airlines](/wiki/Northwest_Orient_Airlines\n\"Northwest Orient Airlines\") in 1961) led to his wondering what the pilots may\nhave said just prior to the wing loss and during the descent as well as the\ntype and nature of any sounds or explosions that may have preceded or occurred\nduring the wing loss. His patent was for a device for recording audio of pilot\nremarks and engine or other sounds to be \"contained with the in-flight\nrecorder within a sealed container that is shock mounted, fireproofed and made\nwatertight\" and \"sealed in such a manner as to be capable of withstanding\nextreme temperatures during a crash fire\". The CSR was an analog device which\nprovided a progressive erasing/recording loop (lasting 30 or more minutes) of\nall sounds (explosion, voice, and the noise of any aircraft structural\ncomponents undergoing serious fracture and breakage) which could be overheard\nin the cockpit.[17]\n\n## Terminology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Terminology\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/J_M_Briscoe24_07_200713_05_14IMG2104_GEE_AIRBORNE.JPG/220px-\nJ_M_Briscoe24_07_200713_05_14IMG2104_GEE_AIRBORNE.JPG)](/wiki/File:J_M_Briscoe24_07_200713_05_14IMG2104_GEE_AIRBORNE.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:J_M_Briscoe24_07_200713_05_14IMG2104_GEE_AIRBORNE.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[GEE](/wiki/Gee_\\(navigation\\) \"Gee \\(navigation\\)\") airborne equipment, with\nthe R1355 receiver on the left and the Indicator Unit Type 62A 'black box' on\nthe right.\n\nThe origin of the term \"black box\" is uncertain. In a [systems\nengineering](/wiki/Systems_engineering \"Systems engineering\") context (since\nthe 1960s when the term was spreading), the meaning is that the aircraft is\nmodeled as a [black box](/wiki/Black_box \"Black box\"), and its behaviour can\nbe understood from its recorded inputs, such as pilot instructions, and\noutputs, such as flight level data.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe term \"black box\" is almost never used within the flight safety industry or\naviation, which prefers the term \"flight recorder\".[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nrecorders are not permitted to be black in color, and must be bright orange,\nas they are intended to be spotted and recovered after incidents.[18] The term\n\"black box\" has been popularised by the media in general.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nOne explanation for popularization of the term \"black box\" comes from the\nearly film-based design of flight data recorders, which required the inside of\nthe recorder to be perfectly dark to prevent light leaks from corrupting the\nrecord, as in a photographer's [darkroom](/wiki/Darkroom \"Darkroom\").[19][20]\n\nAnother explanation of the \"black box\" term popularization came from a meeting\nabout Warren's \"Red Egg\", when afterwards a [journalist](/wiki/Journalist\n\"Journalist\") told Warren: \"This is a wonderful black box.\"[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nunit itself was based on an [EMI](/wiki/EMI \"EMI\") Minifon [wire\nrecorder](/wiki/Wire_recorder \"Wire recorder\") (originally a 1950s espionage\ngadget from the West-German manufacturer [Protona\nMonske](/w/index.php?title=Protona_Monske&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Protona\nMonske \\(page does not exist\\)\")) fitted into a [perspex](/wiki/Acrylic_glass\n\"Acrylic glass\") box firmly screwed together.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAnother possible origin of the term is [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II\n\"World War II\") [RAF](/wiki/Royal_Air_Force \"Royal Air Force\") jargon. Prior\nto the end of the war in 1945, new electronic innovations, such as\n[Oboe](/wiki/Oboe_\\(navigation\\) \"Oboe \\(navigation\\)\"),\n[GEE](/wiki/GEE_\\(navigation\\) \"GEE \\(navigation\\)\") and [H2S](/wiki/H2S_radar\n\"H2S radar\"), were added to bombers on a regular basis. The prototypes were\nroughly covered in hand-made metal boxes, painted black to prevent\nreflections. After a time any piece of \"new\" electronics was referred to as\nthe \"box-of-tricks\" (as [illusionist box](/wiki/Platform_magic \"Platform\nmagic\")) or the \"black box\".[21]\n\nThe first recorded use of the term \"black box\" in reference to flight data\nrecorders and cockpit voice recorders was by Mr E. Newton of the\n[AAIB](/wiki/Air_Accidents_Investigation_Branch \"Air Accidents Investigation\nBranch\") at a meeting of the [Aeronautical Research\nCouncil](/wiki/Advisory_Committee_for_Aeronautics \"Advisory Committee for\nAeronautics\") in August 1958.[22]\n\n## Components[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Components\")]\n\n### Flight data\nrecorder[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Flight data recorder\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Black_box.aeroplane.JPG/220px-\nBlack_box.aeroplane.JPG)](/wiki/File:Black_box.aeroplane.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Black_box.aeroplane.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA typical flight recorder\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Grossi-7.png/220px-\nGrossi-7.png)](/wiki/File:Grossi-7.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Grossi-7.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nCockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, each with an [underwater\nlocator beacon](/wiki/Underwater_locator_beacon \"Underwater locator beacon\")\non the front\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Underwaterlocatorbeacon.JPG/220px-\nUnderwaterlocatorbeacon.JPG)](/wiki/File:Underwaterlocatorbeacon.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Underwaterlocatorbeacon.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn [underwater locator beacon](/wiki/Underwater_locator_beacon \"Underwater\nlocator beacon\"), with a ballpoint pen to provide scale\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Two-In-\nOne_Data_Recorder.JPG/220px-Two-In-One_Data_Recorder.JPG)](/wiki/File:Two-In-\nOne_Data_Recorder.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Two-In-One_Data_Recorder.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA Cockpit Voice and Data Recorder (CVDR), with its attached ULB visible on the\nleft side of the unit\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Flightrecorders.JPG/220px-\nFlightrecorders.JPG)](/wiki/File:Flightrecorders.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Flightrecorders.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder installed on their\nmounting trays in the rear fuselage of an aircraft\n\nA flight data recorder (FDR) (also [ADR, for _accident data\nrecorder_](/wiki/File:Flight_Data_Recorders_at_IWM_Duxford.jpg \"File:Flight\nData Recorders at IWM Duxford.jpg\")) is an electronic device employed to\nrecord instructions sent to any electronic systems on an aircraft. Another\nkind of flight recorder is the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which records\nconversation in the [cockpit](/wiki/Cockpit \"Cockpit\"), radio communications\nbetween the cockpit crew and others (including communication with [air traffic\ncontrol personnel](/wiki/Air_traffic_controller \"Air traffic controller\")), as\nwell as ambient sounds.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe data recorded by the FDR are used for [accident and\nincident](/wiki/Accidents_and_incidents_in_aviation \"Accidents and incidents\nin aviation\") investigation. Due to their importance in investigating\naccidents, these [ICAO](/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization\n\"International Civil Aviation Organization\")-regulated devices are carefully\nengineered and constructed to withstand the force of a high speed impact and\nthe heat of an intense fire. Contrary to the popular term \"black box\", the\nexterior of the FDR is coated with heat-resistant [bright\norange](/wiki/Safety_orange \"Safety orange\") paint for high visibility in\nwreckage, and the unit is usually mounted in the aircraft's [tail\nsection](/wiki/Empennage \"Empennage\"), where it is more likely to survive a\nsevere crash. Following an accident, the recovery of the FDR is usually a high\npriority for the investigating body, as analysis of the recorded parameters\ncan often detect and identify causes or contributing factors.[23]\n\nModern day FDRs receive inputs via specific data frames from the Flight Data\nAcquisition Units ([FDAU](/wiki/FDAU \"FDAU\")). They record significant\n[flight](/wiki/Flight \"Flight\") parameters, including the control and\n[actuator](/wiki/Actuator \"Actuator\") positions, engine information and [time\nof day](/wiki/Timestamp \"Timestamp\"). There are 88 parameters required as a\nminimum under current US federal regulations (only 29 were required until\n2002), but some systems monitor many more variables. Generally each parameter\nis recorded a few times per [second](/wiki/Second \"Second\"), though some units\nstore \"bursts\" of data at a much higher [frequency](/wiki/Frequency\n\"Frequency\") if the data begin to change quickly. Most FDRs record\napproximately 17–25 hours of data in a continuous loop.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] It is\nrequired by regulations that an FDR verification check (readout) is performed\nannually in order to verify that all mandatory parameters are\nrecorded.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nModern FDRs are typically double wrapped in strong [corrosion](/wiki/Corrosion\n\"Corrosion\")-resistant [stainless steel](/wiki/Stainless_steel \"Stainless\nsteel\") or [titanium](/wiki/Titanium \"Titanium\"), with high-temperature\n[insulation](/wiki/Thermal_insulation \"Thermal insulation\") inside.

This is typically achieved by recording the signals\nof the microphones and earphones of the pilots' headsets and of an area\nmicrophone in the roof of the cockpit. The current applicable [FAA](/wiki/FAA\n\"FAA\") [TSO](/wiki/Technical_Standard_Order \"Technical Standard Order\") is\nC123b titled Cockpit Voice Recorder Equipment.[26]\n\nWhere an aircraft is required to carry a CVR and uses digital communications\nthe CVR is required to record such communications with air traffic control\nunless this is recorded elsewhere. As of\n2008[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit)\nit is an FAA requirement that the recording duration is a minimum of two\nhours.[27]\n\nA standard CVR is capable of recording 4 channels of audio data for a period\nof 2 hours. The original requirement was for a CVR to record for 30 minutes,\nbut this has been found to be insufficient in many cases, significant parts of\nthe audio data needed for a subsequent investigation having occurred more than\n30 minutes before the end of the recording.\n\nThe earliest CVRs used analog [wire recording](/wiki/Wire_recording \"Wire\nrecording\"), later replaced by analog [magnetic tape](/wiki/Magnetic_tape\n\"Magnetic tape\"). Some of the tape units used two reels, with the tape\nautomatically reversing at each end. The original was the ARL Flight Memory\nUnit produced in 1957 by [Australian](/wiki/Australian \"Australian\") [David\nWarren](/wiki/David_Warren_\\(inventor\\) \"David Warren \\(inventor\\)\") and an\ninstrument maker named [Tych\nMirfield](/w/index.php?title=Tych_Mirfield&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Tych\nMirfield \\(page does not exist\\)\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nOther units used a single reel, with the tape spliced into a continuous loop,\nmuch as in an [8-track cartridge](/wiki/8-track_cartridge \"8-track\ncartridge\"). The tape would circulate and old audio information would be\noverwritten every 30 minutes. Recovery of sound from magnetic tape often\nproves difficult if the recorder is recovered from water and its housing has\nbeen breached. Thus, the latest designs employ [solid-state\nmemory](/wiki/Solid-state_drive \"Solid-state drive\") and use digital recording\ntechniques, making them much more resistant to shock, vibration and moisture.\nWith the reduced power requirements of solid-state recorders, it is now\npractical to incorporate a battery in the units, so that recording can\ncontinue until flight termination, even if the aircraft electrical system\nfails.\n\nLike the FDR, the CVR is typically mounted in the rear of the airplane\n[fuselage](/wiki/Fuselage \"Fuselage\") to maximize the likelihood of its\nsurvival in a crash.[28]\n\n### Combined\nunits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Combined units\")]\n\nWith the advent of digital recorders, the FDR and CVR can be manufactured in\none fireproof, shock proof, and waterproof container as a combined digital\nCockpit Voice and Data Recorder (CVDR). Currently a CVDR is manufactured by\nL-3 Communications[29] as well as other manufacturers.\n\nSolid state recorders became commercially practical in 1990, having the\nadvantage of not requiring scheduled maintenance and making the data easier to\nretrieve. This was extended to the two-hour voice recording in 1995.[30]\n\n### Additional\nequipment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Additional equipment\")]\n\nSince the 1970s, most large civil jet transports have been additionally\nequipped with a \"[quick access recorder](/wiki/Quick_access_recorder \"Quick\naccess recorder\")\" (QAR). This records data on a removable storage medium.\nAccess to the FDR and CVR is necessarily difficult because of the requirement\nthat they survive an accident. They also require specialized equipment to read\nthe recording. The QAR recording medium is readily removable and is designed\nto be read by equipment attached to a standard desktop computer. In many\nairlines, the quick access recordings are scanned for 'events', an event being\na significant deviation from normal operational parameters. This allows\noperational problems to be detected and eliminated before an accident or\nincident results.\n\nMany modern aircraft systems are [digital or digitally controlled](/wiki/Fly-\nby-wire \"Fly-by-wire\"). Very often, the digital system will include Built-In\nTest Equipment which records information about the operation of the system.\nThis information may also be accessed to assist with the investigation of an\naccident or incident.\n\n##\nSpecifications[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Specifications\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/GravadoVoz.jpg/220px-\nGravadoVoz.jpg)](/wiki/File:GravadoVoz.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:GravadoVoz.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCockpit voice recorder memory module of PR-GTD, a [Gol Transportes Aéreos\nBoeing 737-8EH SFP](/wiki/Gol_Transportes_A%C3%A9reos_Flight_1907 \"Gol\nTransportes Aéreos Flight 1907\"), found in the\n[Amazon](/wiki/Amazon_Rainforest \"Amazon Rainforest\") in [Mato\nGrosso](/wiki/Mato_Grosso \"Mato Grosso\"), [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil \"Brazil\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Caixa-\nPreta_GOL.jpg/220px-Caixa-Preta_GOL.jpg)](/wiki/File:Caixa-Preta_GOL.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Caixa-Preta_GOL.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAfter the crash of [Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight\n1907](/wiki/Gol_Transportes_A%C3%A9reos_Flight_1907 \"Gol Transportes Aéreos\nFlight 1907\"), [Brazilian Air Force](/wiki/Brazilian_Air_Force \"Brazilian Air\nForce\") personnel show the recovered flight data recorder\n\nThe design of today's FDR is governed by the internationally recognized\nstandards and recommended practices relating to flight recorders which are\ncontained in [ICAO](/wiki/ICAO \"ICAO\") Annex 6 which makes reference to\nindustry crashworthiness and fire protection specifications such as those to\nbe found in the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment[31]\ndocuments EUROCAE ED55, ED56 fiken A and ED112 (Minimum Operational\nPerformance Specification for Crash Protected Airborne Recorder Systems). In\nthe United States, the [Federal Aviation\nAdministration](/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration \"Federal Aviation\nAdministration\") (FAA) regulates all aspects of US aviation, and cites\n[design](/wiki/Design \"Design\") [requirements](/wiki/Requirement\n\"Requirement\") in their Technical Standard Order,[32] based on the EUROCAE\ndocuments (as do the aviation authorities of many other countries).\n\nCurrently, EUROCAE specifies that a recorder must be able to withstand an\nacceleration of 3400 _[g](/wiki/G-force \"G-force\")_ (33 km/s²) for 6.5\n[milliseconds](/wiki/Millisecond \"Millisecond\"). This is roughly equivalent to\nan [impact](/wiki/Impact_\\(mechanics\\) \"Impact \\(mechanics\\)\")\n[velocity](/wiki/Velocity \"Velocity\") of 270 knots (310 mph; 500 km/h) and a\n[deceleration](/wiki/Deceleration \"Deceleration\") or crushing distance of 45\n[cm](/wiki/Centimeter \"Centimeter\").[33] Additionally, there are\n[requirements](/wiki/Requirement \"Requirement\") for penetration resistance,\n[static](/wiki/Statics \"Statics\") crush, high and low temperature\n[fires](/wiki/Fire \"Fire\"), deep sea [pressure](/wiki/Pressure \"Pressure\"),\n[sea water](/wiki/Sea_water \"Sea water\") immersion, and [fluid](/wiki/Fluid\n\"Fluid\") immersion.\n\nEUROCAE ED-112 (Minimum Operational Performance Specification for Crash\nProtected Airborne Recorder Systems) defines the minimum specification to be\nmet for all aircraft requiring flight recorders for recording of flight data,\ncockpit audio, images and CNS / ATM digital messages and used for\ninvestigations of accidents or incidents.[34] When issued in March 2003 ED-112\nsuperseded previous ED-55 and ED-56A that were separate specifications for FDR\nand CVR. [FAA](/wiki/FAA \"FAA\") [TSOs](/wiki/Technical_Standard_Order\n\"Technical Standard Order\") for FDR and CVR reference ED-112 for\ncharacteristics common to both types.\n\nIn order to facilitate recovery of the recorder from an aircraft accident site\nthey are required to be coloured bright yellow or orange with reflective\nsurfaces. All are lettered \"FLIGHT RECORDER DO NOT OPEN\" on one side in\nEnglish and the same in French on the other side. To assist recovery from\nsubmerged sites they must be equipped with an underwater locator beacon which\nis automatically activated in the event of an accident.\n\n## Regulation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Regulation\")]\n\nIn the investigation of the 1960 crash of [Trans Australia Airlines Flight\n538](/wiki/Trans_Australia_Airlines_Flight_538 \"Trans Australia Airlines\nFlight 538\") at Mackay ([Queensland](/wiki/Queensland \"Queensland\")), the\ninquiry judge strongly recommended that flight recorders be installed in all\n(Australian) airliners. Australia became the first country in the world to\nmake cockpit-voice recording compulsory.[35][36]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/DFDR_from_Flight_294.png/220px-\nDFDR_from_Flight_294.png)](/wiki/File:DFDR_from_Flight_294.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:DFDR_from_Flight_294.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Digital Flight Data Recorder from [West Air Sweden Flight\n294](/wiki/West_Air_Sweden_Flight_294 \"West Air Sweden Flight 294\"). All data\nwas collected, even though the rest of the aircraft was heavily fragmented\n\nThe United States' first CVR rules were passed in 1964, requiring all turbine\nand piston aircraft with four or more engines to have CVRs by March 1,\n1967.[37] As of\n2008[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit)\nit is an FAA requirement that the CVR recording duration is a minimum of two\nhours,[27] following the NTSB recommendation that it should be increased from\nits previously-mandated 30-minute duration.[38] As of\n2014[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit),\nthe United States requires flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders\non aircraft that have 20 or more passenger seats, or those that have six or\nmore passenger seats, are turbine-powered, and require two pilots.[39]\n\nFor US air carriers and manufacturers, the [National Transportation Safety\nBoard](/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board \"National Transportation\nSafety Board\") (NTSB) is responsible for investigating accidents and safety-\nrelated incidents. The NTSB also serves in an advisory role for many\ninternational investigations not under its formal jurisdiction. The NTSB does\nnot have regulatory authority, but must depend on legislation and other\ngovernment agencies to act on its safety recommendations.[40] In addition, 49\nUSC Section 1114(c) prohibits the NTSB from making the audio recordings public\nexcept by written transcript.[41]\n\nThe [ARINC](/wiki/ARINC \"ARINC\") Standards are prepared by the Airlines\nElectronic Engineering Committee (AEEC). The 700 Series of standards describe\nthe form, fit, and function of avionics equipment installed predominately on\ntransport category aircraft. The FDR is defined by ARINC Characteristic 747.\nThe CVR is defined by ARINC Characteristic 757.[42]\n\n### Proposed\nrequirements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Proposed requirements\")]\n\n#### Deployable\nrecorders[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Deployable recorders\")]\n\nThe NTSB recommended in 1999 that operators be required to install two sets of\nCVDR systems, with the second CVDR set being \"deployable or ejectable\". The\n\"deployable\" recorder combines the cockpit voice/flight data recorders and an\nemergency locator transmitter (ELT) in a single unit. The \"deployable\" unit\nwould depart the aircraft before impact, activated by sensors. The unit is\ndesigned to \"eject\" and \"fly\" away from the crash site, to survive the\nterminal velocity of fall, to float on water indefinitely, and would be\nequipped with satellite technology for immediate location of crash impact\nsite. The \"deployable\" CVDR technology has been used by the US Navy since\n1993.[43] The recommendations would involve a massive retrofit program.\nHowever, government funding would negate cost objections from manufacturers\nand airlines. Operators would get both sets of recorders for free: they would\nnot have to pay for the one set they are currently required by law to carry.\nThe cost of the second \"deployable/ejectable CVDR\" (or \"Black Box\") was\nestimated at US$30 million for installation in 500 new aircraft (about $60,000\nper new commercial plane).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn the United States, the proposed SAFE Act calls for implementing the NTSB\n1999 recommendations. However, so far the SAFE ACT legislation has failed to\npass [Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\"), having\nbeen introduced in 2003 (H.R. 2632), in 2005 (H.R. 3336), and in 2007 (H.R.\n4336).[44] Originally the \"Safe Aviation Flight Enhancement (SAFE) Act of\n2003\"[45] was introduced on June 26, 2003 by Congressman David Price (NC) and\nCongressman John Duncan (Tennessee) in a bipartisan effort to ensure\ninvestigators have access to information immediately following commercial\naccidents.[43]\n\nOn July 19, 2005, a revised SAFE Act was introduced and referred to the\nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the US House of\nRepresentatives. The bill was referred to the House Subcommittee on Aviation\nduring the 108th, 109th, and 110th Congresses.[46][47][48]\n\n#### Image\nrecorders[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Image recorders\")]\n\nThe NTSB has asked for the installation of cockpit image recorders in large\ntransport aircraft to provide information that would supplement existing CVR\nand FDR data in accident investigations. They have recommended that image\nrecorders be placed into smaller aircraft that are not required to have a CVR\nor FDR.[49] The rationale is that what is seen on an instrument by the pilots\nof an aircraft is not necessarily the same as the data sent to the display\ndevice. This is particularly true of aircraft equipped with electronic\ndisplays ([CRT](/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube \"Cathode ray tube\") or\n[LCD](/wiki/Liquid_crystal_display \"Liquid crystal display\")). A mechanical\ninstrument is likely to preserve its last indication, but this is not the case\nwith an electronic display. Such systems, estimated to cost less than $8,000\ninstalled, typically consist of a camera and microphone located in the cockpit\nto continuously record cockpit instrumentation, the outside viewing area,\nengine sounds, radio communications, and ambient cockpit sounds. As with\nconventional CVRs and FDRs, data from such a system is stored in a crash-\nprotected unit to ensure survivability.[49] Since the recorders can sometimes\nbe crushed into unreadable pieces, or even located in deep water, some modern\nunits are self-ejecting (taking advantage of [kinetic\nenergy](/wiki/Kinetic_energy \"Kinetic energy\") at impact to separate\nthemselves from the aircraft) and also equipped with [radio](/wiki/Radio\n\"Radio\") [emergency locator transmitters](/wiki/Emergency_locator_transmitter\n\"Emergency locator transmitter\") and [sonar](/wiki/Sonar \"Sonar\") underwater\nlocator beacons to aid in their location.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### After Malaysia Airlines Flight\n370[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit\nsection: After Malaysia Airlines Flight 370\")]\n\nOn March 12, 2014, in response to the missing [Malaysia Airlines Flight\n370](/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370 \"Malaysia Airlines Flight 370\"), David\nPrice re-introduced the SAFE Act in the US House of Representatives.[50]\n\nThe disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 demonstrated the limits of\nthe contemporary flight recorder technology, namely how physical possession of\nthe flight recorder device is necessary to help investigate the cause of an\naircraft incident. Considering the advances of modern communication,\ntechnology commentators called for flight recorders to be supplemented or\nreplaced by a system that provides \"live streaming\" of data from the aircraft\nto the ground.[51][52][53] Furthermore, commentators called for the underwater\nlocator beacon's range and battery life to be extended, as well as the\noutfitting of civil aircraft with the deployable flight recorders typically\nused in military aircraft. Previous to MH370, the investigators of the 2009\n[Air France Flight 447](/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447 \"Air France Flight 447\")\nurged to extend the battery life as \"rapidly as possible\" after the crash's\nflight recorders went unrecovered for over a year.[54]\n\n### After Indonesia AirAsia Flight\n8501[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: After Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501\")]\n\nOn December 28, 2014, [Indonesia AirAsia Flight\n8501](/wiki/Indonesia_AirAsia_Flight_8501 \"Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501\"),\n_en route_ from [Surabaya](/wiki/Surabaya \"Surabaya\"), Indonesia, to\n[Singapore](/wiki/Singapore \"Singapore\"), crashed in bad weather, killing all\n155 passengers and seven crew on board.[55]\n\nOn January 12 and 13, 2015, following the recovery of the flight recorders, an\nanonymous [ICAO](/wiki/ICAO \"ICAO\") representative said: \"The time has come\nthat deployable recorders are going to get a serious look.\"[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Unlike\nmilitary recorders, which jettison away from an aircraft, signaling their\nlocation to search and rescue bodies, recorders on commercial aircraft remain\ninside the fuselage. A second ICAO official said that public attention had\n\"galvanized momentum in favour of ejectable recorders on commercial\naircraft\".[56]\n\n## Cultural\nreferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_recorder&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Cultural references\")]\n\nThe artwork for the band [Rammstein](/wiki/Rammstein \"Rammstein\")'s album\n_[Reise, Reise](/wiki/Reise,_Reise \"Reise, Reise\")_ is made to look like a\nCVR; it also includes a recording from a crash.
