The\nmovement for an independent agency to oversee these federal lands was\nspearheaded by [business magnate](/wiki/Business_magnate \"Business magnate\")\nand [conservationist](/wiki/Conservation_movement \"Conservation movement\")\n[Stephen Mather](/wiki/Stephen_Mather \"Stephen Mather\"), as well as [J. Horace\nMcFarland](/wiki/J._Horace_McFarland \"J. Horace McFarland\"). With the help of\njournalist [Robert Sterling Yard](/wiki/Robert_Sterling_Yard \"Robert Sterling\nYard\"), Mather ran a publicity campaign for the [Department of the\nInterior](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior \"United States\nDepartment of the Interior\"). They wrote numerous articles that praised the\nscenic and historic qualities of the parks and their possibilities for\neducational, inspirational, and recreational benefits.[4] This campaign\nresulted in the creation of a National Park Service. On August 25, 1916,\nPresident [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson \"Woodrow Wilson\") signed a\nbill that mandated the agency \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and\nhistoric objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the\nsame in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the\nenjoyment of future generations.\"[5] Mather became the first director of the\nnewly formed NPS.[6]\n\nOn March 3, 1933, President [Herbert Hoover](/wiki/Herbert_Hoover \"Herbert\nHoover\") signed the Reorganization Act of 1933. The act would allow the\nPresident to reorganize the executive branch of the United States government.\nIt wasn't until later that summer when the new President, [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\"), made use of\nthis power. Deputy Director [Horace M. Albright](/wiki/Horace_M._Albright\n\"Horace M. Albright\") had suggested to President Roosevelt that the historic\nsites from the American Civil War should be managed by the National Park\nService, rather than the War Department. President Roosevelt agreed and issued\ntwo [Executive orders](/wiki/Executive_order_\\(United_States\\) \"Executive\norder \\(United States\\)\") to make it happen. These two executive orders not\nonly transferred to the National Park Service all the War Department historic\nsites, but also the national monuments managed by the Department of\nAgriculture and the parks in and around the capital, which had been run by an\nindependent office.[7]\n\nIn 1951, [Conrad Wirth](/wiki/Conrad_Wirth \"Conrad Wirth\") became director of\nthe National Park Service and went to work on bringing park facilities up to\nthe standards that the public expected. The demand for parks after the end of\nthe [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") had left the parks\noverburdened with demands that could not be met. In 1952, with the support of\nPresident [Dwight D. Eisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D.\nEisenhower\"), he began [Mission 66](/wiki/Mission_66 \"Mission 66\"), a ten-year\neffort to upgrade and expand park facilities for the 50th anniversary of the\nPark Service. New parks were added to preserve unique resources and existing\npark facilities were upgraded and expanded.[7]\n\nIn 1966, as the Park Service turned 50 years old, emphasis began to turn from\njust saving great and wonderful scenery and unique natural features to making\nparks accessible to the public. Director [George\nHartzog](/wiki/George_B._Hartzog_Jr. \"George B.

In 1872, there was no [state\ngovernment](/wiki/State_government \"State government\") to manage it, so the\n[federal government](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal\ngovernment of the United States\") assumed direct control. [Yosemite National\nPark](/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park \"Yosemite National Park\") began as a [state\npark](/wiki/State_park \"State park\"); the land for the park was donated by the\nfederal government to the state of [California](/wiki/California \"California\")\nin 1864 for perpetual conservation. Yosemite was later returned to federal\nownership.\n\nAt first, each national park was managed independently, with varying degrees\nof success. In Yellowstone, the civilian staff was replaced by the [U.S.\nArmy](/wiki/Fort_Yellowstone \"Fort Yellowstone\") in 1886. Due to the\nirregularities in managing these national treasures, Stephen Mather petitioned\nthe federal government to improve the situation. In response, Secretary of the\nInterior [Franklin K. Lane](/wiki/Franklin_Knight_Lane \"Franklin Knight Lane\")\nchallenged him to [lobby](/wiki/Lobbying \"Lobbying\") for creating a new\nagency, the National Park Service, to manage all national parks and some\nnational monuments. Mather was successful with the ratification of the\n[National Park Service Organic Act](/wiki/National_Park_Service_Organic_Act\n\"National Park Service Organic Act\") in 1916.[8] Later, the agency was given\nauthority over other protected areas, many with varying designations as\nCongress created them.\n\n##\nDirectors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Directors\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/NPS_DirectorandStaff.jpg/220px-\nNPS_DirectorandStaff.jpg)](/wiki/File:NPS_DirectorandStaff.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:NPS_DirectorandStaff.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Stephen Mather](/wiki/Stephen_Mather \"Stephen Mather\") (center) and his\nstaff, 1927 or 1928\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Jon_Jarvis_Older_2009.jpg/220px-\nJon_Jarvis_Older_2009.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jon_Jarvis_Older_2009.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jon_Jarvis_Older_2009.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Jon Jarvis](/wiki/Jonathan_Jarvis \"Jonathan Jarvis\"), Former NPS Director\n\n| Name[9] | Term of office  \n---|---|---  \nStart | End  \n1 | [Stephen Mather](/wiki/Stephen_Mather \"Stephen Mather\") | May 16, 1917 | January 8, 1929  \n2 | [Horace M.

Within each of these areas, there\nare numerous specific purposes to which Congress directs the services\nactivities.[18] The budget of the National Park Service includes\n_discretionary_ spending which is broken out into two portions: the direct\noperations of the National Parks and the special initiatives.[19] Listed\nseparately are the special initiatives of the service for the year specified\nin the legislation. For Fiscal Year 2010, the service has been charged with\nfive initiatives. They include: Stewardship and Education; Professional\nExcellence; Youth Programs; Climate Impacts; and Budget Restructure and\nRealignment.[19]\n\n### Discretionary\nspending[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Discretionary spending\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/NPS_Budget_%282001-2006%29.jpg/220px-\nNPS_Budget_%282001-2006%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:NPS_Budget_\\(2001-2006\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:NPS_Budget_\\(2001-2006\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNPS _Operations of the National Parks_ budget from FY 2001-FY 2006\n\nDiscretionary spending includes the Operations of the National Parks (ONPS),\nfrom which all park operations are paid. The _United States Park Police_ funds\ncover the high-profile law enforcement operations at some of the large parks;\ni.e., [Gateway National Recreation\nArea](/wiki/Gateway_National_Recreation_Area \"Gateway National Recreation\nArea\"), [Golden Gate National Recreation\nArea](/wiki/Golden_Gate_National_Recreation_Area \"Golden Gate National\nRecreation Area\"), and the [National Mall](/wiki/National_Mall \"National\nMall\"). The _National Recreation and Preservation Program_ and the _Urban Park\nand Recreation Fund_ are outreach programs to support state and local outdoor\nrecreational activities.[18]\n\nThe ONPS section of the budget is divided into five operational areas. These\nareas include:\n\n### Resource\nstewardship[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Resource stewardship\")]\n\nThese are funds and people directed towards the restoration, preservation, and\nmaintenance of natural and cultural resources.

This area is commonly staffed by park rangers, who are trained in\nproviding walks, talks, and educational programs to the public. There is an\nincreased number of media specialists, who provide for the exhibits along\ntrails, roads and in visitor contact facilities, as well as the written\nbrochures and web-sites.[19]\n\n### Park\nprotection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Park protection\")]\n\nThis includes the staff responding to visitor emergencies (medical and\ncriminal), and the protection of the park's natural and cultural resources\nfrom damage by those persons visiting the park. The staff includes [park\nrangers](/wiki/National_Park_Service_Ranger \"National Park Service Ranger\"),\n[park police](/wiki/United_States_Park_Police \"United States Park Police\"),\ncriminal investigators, and communication center operators.[19]\n\n### Facility maintenance and\noperations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Facility maintenance and operations\")]\n\nThis is the cost of maintaining the necessary infrastructure within each park\nthat supports all the services provided. It includes the plows and heavy\nequipment for road clearing, repairs and construction. There are buildings,\ntrails, roads, docks, boats, utility pipes and wires, and a variety of hidden\nsystems that make a park accessible by the public. The staff includes\nequipment operators, custodians, trail crews, electricians, plumbers,\nengineers, architects, and other building trade specialists.[19]\n\n### Park\nsupport[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Park support\")]\n\nThis is the staff that provides for the routine logistical needs of the parks.\nThere are human resource specialists, contracting officers, property\nspecialists, budget managers, accountants and information technology\nspecialists.[19]\n\n### External administrative\ncosts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: External administrative costs\")]\n\nThese costs are bills that are paid directly to outside organizations as part\nof the logistical support needed to run the parks.

The 2010 funds are the beginning of an incremental process to fully\nfund LWCF programs at $900 million. The Department of the Interior and the\nU.S. Forest Service use these funds to purchase critical lands to protect\nexisting public lands. Grants will be made to states and local communities to\npreserve and protect Civil War battlefield sites that are not part of the\nnational park system. The NPS State Conservation Assistance program\ndistributes funding to States for land preservation.[19]\n\n###\nConstruction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Construction\")]\n\nThis segment of the budget provides for the construction of new facilities or\nthe replacement of aging and unsafe facilities. Additionally, there are funds\nin the recreation fees, park roads funding, and the [American Recovery and\nReinvestment Act](/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act \"American\nRecovery and Reinvestment Act\") that provide for other specific\nfacilities/infrastructure work.

Among the programs supported are the Rivers, Trails, and\nConservation Assistance programs that promote community links to parks,\nnatural resource conservation and outdoor recreation across America.[19]\n\n### Offsetting reductions and fixed costs in various\naccounts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Offsetting reductions and fixed costs in various accounts\")]\n\nWithin this category are a number of one-time events, which are added or\nremoved as the events require. Notably in the FY 2009 and FY 2010 is the\nremoval of the costs for the presidential inaugural. Other savings are\nidentified through reduced operational costs from energy-efficient retro-\nfitting and the demolition of structures beyond repair.[19]\n\n### American Recovery and Reinvestment\nAct[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\")]\n\nOtherwise known as \"stimulus funds,\" the [American Recovery and Reinvestment\nAct of 2009](/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009 \"American\nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\") provides funds to restore and preserve\nmajor infrastructures within the national parks.[19]\n\n### Great Lakes Restoration\nInitiative[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Great Lakes Restoration Initiative\")]\n\nThe Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, is a $475.0 million proposal included\nin the [U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency](/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency \"United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\") budget.

They\nrange from the Web Ranger[32] on-line program to many programs in each\nNational Park Unit.[33] The primary work opportunities for youth are through\nthe Youth Corp networks.\n\nThe oldest serving group is the Student Conservation Association (SCA). It was\nestablished in 1957, committed to conservation and preservation. The SCA's\ngoal is to create the next generation of conservation leaders. SCA volunteers\nwork through internships, conservation jobs, and crew experiences. Volunteers\nconduct resource management, historic preservation, cultural resources and\nconservation programs to gain experience, which can lead to career development\nand further educational opportunities. The SCA places volunteers in more than\n350 national park units and NPS offices each year.[34]\n\nThe Corps Network, formerly known as the National Association for Service and\nCorps (NASCC), represents 136 Service and Conservation Corps. These groups\nhave programs in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Corpsmembers are\nbetween the ages of 16–25. Service and Conservation Corps are direct\ndescendants of the [Civilian Conservation\nCorps](/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps \"Civilian Conservation Corps\") (CCC)\nof the 1930s that built park facilities in the national parks and other public\nparks around the country. The Corps Network was established in 1985.[35]\n\n  * Youth Conservation Corps (ages 15–18) \n    * The Youth Conservation Corps (YCC), bring young people into a park to restore, preserve and protect a natural, cultural, or historical resources. Enrollees are paid for their work.[36]\n  * Public Land Corps (ages 16–25) \n    * The Public Land Corps (PLC) is a job helping to restore, protect, and rehabilitate a local national parks. The enrollees learn about environmental issues and the park. A dozen non-profit.[37]\n  * Programs for Boy Scouts (ages 7–18) \n    * The National Park Service works with the [Boy Scouts of America](/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America \"Boy Scouts of America\"). Members can become a Scout Ranger and earn a patch. The Service formerly participated every four years at the BSA Jamboree at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. Many scouts have completed their Eagle projects in a National Park helping preserve the resources, while furthering the scouting experience.[38]\n  * Programs for Girl Scouts (ages 5–18) \n    * [Girl Scouts](/wiki/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA \"Girl Scouts of the USA\") can become a Girl Scout Ranger and earn a patch. The National Park Service works with Girl Scout Troops through their _Linking Girls to the Land_.[39]\n\n##\nAccessibility[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Accessibility\")]\n\nAccess Pass\n\nThe [Access Pass](/wiki/Access_Pass \"Access Pass\") offers free, lifetime\nadmission to federal areas of the National Park Service, Bureau of Land\nManagement, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S.\nForest Service, and Tennessee Valley Authority.[40]\n\nService Animals\n\nService animals are allowed in all facilities and on most trails, with the\nexceptions of stock trails and areas closed by the superintendent to protect\npark resources. Service animals must always be leashed. Service animals in\ntraining and pets are subject to other park regulations. When traveling with\nan animal, carry water, and allow for stops. Dispose of pet feces in a trash\nbin.[40]\n\nCamping\n\nThe National Park System offers numerous accessible camping opportunities. In\nover 120 units, campgrounds have sites specifically designed for tent camper\naccessibility. Special camp sites are located near restrooms with paved\nwalkways to and from the restroom and water sources. Sites have hardened\ntenting sites that provide for easy access, but allow for tents to be erected\non soil. Many additional units have pull-through trailer sites, providing for\nmotorized use, but may have limited access to the rest of the campground\nfacilities.[41]\n\nTrails\n\nMany National Park units have fully accessible trails. Visitors should check\nthe park's web-site to insure that the trail is designed to meet their\nindividual needs. Trails may have a compacted gravel surface, paved with\nasphalt, or a board walk. Many will have guardrails, others may have a ridge\nalong the edge, detectable by the visually impaired using a cane and capable\nof stopping a wheelchair. Many have no detectable edge when there is a stable\nsurface.[42]\n\nVistas\n\nParks that are known for their scenic vistas make them available through a\nvariety of designs. Paved overlooks with accessible parking is the most\ncommon, and not always identified in written material. Road designs are\nconfigured to provide for mountain and landscape vistas from a vehicle.[43]\n\nAdditional information at \"The Disabled Traveler's Companion\".[44]\n\n##\nConcessions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Concessions\")]\n\nIn an effort to increase visitation and allow for a larger audience to enjoy\nnational park land, the National Park Service has numerous\n[concession](/wiki/Concession_\\(contract\\) \"Concession \\(contract\\)\")\ncontracts with private businesses to bring recreation, resorts and other\n_compatible_ amenities to their parks.

Delaware North lost the\ncontract, and asserted that the historic names were worth $51 million and\nmaintained that the incoming concessioner had to be paid that amount.[49] The\nJustice Department and the NPS asserted that this was an \"improper and wildly\ninflated\" value. Rather than pay Delaware North's demanded valuation, in\nJanuary 2016 the NPS instead opted to rename the famous landmarks, effective\nin March. The [Ahwahnee Hotel](/wiki/Ahwahnee_Hotel \"Ahwahnee Hotel\") is\nslated to become The Majestic Yosemite Hotel, Curry Village will become Half\nDome Village, and the Wawona Hotel will become Big Trees Lodge.[50] Widespread\npublic outcry focused on Delaware North's decision to claim ownership of names\nwithin a national park.[51]\n\n##\nBookstores[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Bookstores\")]\n\nAt many Park Service sites a bookstore is operated by a [non-\nprofit](/wiki/Non-profit_organization \"Non-profit organization\") [cooperating\nassociation](/wiki/Cooperating_Associations \"Cooperating Associations\").

Dating from 1934, the [Historic American Buildings\nSurvey](/wiki/Historic_American_Buildings_Survey \"Historic American Buildings\nSurvey\") (HABS) was chartered to document historic architecture—primarily\nhouses and public buildings—of national or regional significance. Originally a\n[New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\") employment/preservation program, after\nWorld War II, HABS employed summer teams of advanced undergraduate and\ngraduate students to carry out the documentation, a tradition followed to this\nday. Many of the structures they documented no longer exist.\n\nHABS/HAER produces measured drawings, large-format photographs and written\nhistories of historic sites, structures and objects, that are significant to\nthe architectural, engineering and industrial heritage of the U.S. Its 25,000\nrecords are part of the Library of Congress. HABS/HAER is administered by the\nNPS Washington office and five regional offices.[84]\n\n**Historic American Buildings Survey**  \nIn 1933, the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, established\nthe Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), based on a proposal by Charles\nE. Peterson, Park Service landscape architect. It was founded as a make-work\nprogram for architects, draftsmen and photographers left jobless by the Great\nDepression. Guided by field instructions from Washington, D.C., the first\nrecorders were tasked with documenting a representative sampling of America's\narchitectural heritage. After 70 years, there is now an archive of historic\narchitecture. HABS provided a database of primary source material for the then\nfledgling historic preservation movement.\n\n**Historic American Engineering Record**  \nRecognizing a similar fragility in our national industrial and engineering\nheritage, the National Park Service, the Library of Congress and the American\nSociety of Civil Engineers (ASCE) formed the HAER program in 1969, to document\nnationally and regionally significant engineering and industrial sites. A\nshort while later, HAER was ratified by the [American Society of Mechanical\nEngineers](/wiki/American_Society_of_Mechanical_Engineers \"American Society of\nMechanical Engineers\") (ASME), the Institute of Electrical and Electronic\nEngineers (IEEE), the [American Institute of Chemical\nEngineers](/wiki/American_Institute_of_Chemical_Engineers \"American Institute\nof Chemical Engineers\") (AIChE) and the American Institute of Mining,\nMetallurgical and Petroleum Engineers (AIME).

Parks in the CFP\nprogram create and implement plans to reduce greenhouse gases through reducing\nenergy and water use. Facilities are designed and retrofitted using\nsustainable materials. Alternative transportation systems are developed to\nreduce dependency on fossil fuels.[103] Parks in the program offer public\neducation programs about how the parks are already affected. The program\nprovides climate friendly solutions to the visiting public, like using clean\nenergy, reducing waste, and making smart transportation choices.[104] The CFP\nprogram can provide technical assistance, tools and resources for the parks\nand their neighboring communities to protect the natural and cultural\nresources.[105]\n\nThe large, isolated parks typically generate their own electricity and heat\nand must do so without spoiling the values that the visitors have come to\nexperience. Pollution is emitted by the vehicles used to transport visitors\naround the often-vast expanses of the parks. Many parks have converted\nvehicles to [electric hybrids](/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicles \"Hybrid electric\nvehicles\"), and substitute [diesel/electric hybrid buses](/wiki/Diesel-\nelectric \"Diesel-electric\") for private automobiles. In 2001 it was estimated\nthat replacement with [electric vehicles](/wiki/Electric_vehicle \"Electric\nvehicle\") would eliminate 25 TPY emissions entirely.[106]\n\nIn 2010, the National Park Service estimated that reducing bottled water could\neliminate 6,000 tons of carbon emissions and 8 million kilowatt hours of\nelectricity every year. The NPS Concessions office voiced concerns about\nconcessions impacts.[107]\n\nBy 2014, 23 parks had banned disposable water bottles.[108] In 2015, the\nInternational Bottled Water Association stated the NPS was \"leaving sugary\ndrinks as a primary alternative\", even though the Park Service provides water\nstations to refill bottles, \"encouraging visitors to hydrate for free.\" The\nWater Association made the national parks one of its top lobbying targets and\nin July 2015 Rep. [Keith Rothfus](/wiki/Keith_Rothfus \"Keith Rothfus\") added a\n\"last-minute\" amendment into Congress's appropriations bill, blocking the\nNational Park Service from funding or enforcing the program.[109] The National\nPark Service discontinued its ban on disposable water bottles in August\n2017.[110]\n\n## Related\nacts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=49\n\"Edit section: Related acts\")]\n\n  * [Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act](/wiki/Alaska_National_Interest_Lands_Conservation_Act \"Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act\") of 1980\n  * [Antiquities Act](/wiki/Antiquities_Act \"Antiquities Act\") or Lacy Act of 1906\n  * [Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008](/wiki/Consolidated_Natural_Resources_Act_of_2008 \"Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008\")\n  * [Endangered Species Act](/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act \"Endangered Species Act\") of 1973\n  * [Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978](/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_Amendments_of_1978 \"Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978\")\n  * [Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act](/wiki/Fish_and_Wildlife_Coordination_Act \"Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act\") of 1934\n  * [Historic Sites Act](/wiki/Historic_Sites_Act \"Historic Sites Act\") of 1935\n  * [Lacey Act](/wiki/Lacey_Act \"Lacey Act\") of 1900 (Wildlife preservation)\n  * [Marine Mammal Protection Act](/wiki/Marine_Mammal_Protection_Act_of_1972 \"Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972\") of 1972\n  * [National Park Service General Authorities Act](/wiki/National_Park_Service_General_Authorities_Act \"National Park Service General Authorities Act\") of 1970\n  * [National Park Service Organic Act](/wiki/National_Park_Service_Organic_Act \"National Park Service Organic Act\") of 1916\n  * [National Environmental Policy Act](/wiki/National_Environmental_Policy_Act \"National Environmental Policy Act\") of 1970 (NEPA)\n  * [National Historic Preservation Act of 1966](/wiki/National_Historic_Preservation_Act_of_1966 \"National Historic Preservation Act of 1966\") (NHPA)\n  * [National Wild and Scenic River](/wiki/National_Wild_and_Scenic_River \"National Wild and Scenic River\") of 1968\n  * [Redwood Act](/wiki/Redwood_Act_\\(1978\\) \"Redwood Act \\(1978\\)\") of 1978, creating one protection standard for the System\n  * [Resource Conservation and Recovery Act](/wiki/Resource_Conservation_and_Recovery_Act \"Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\") of 1976\n  * [Wilderness Act](/wiki/Wilderness_Act \"Wilderness Act\") of 1964\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=50\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n###\nAreas[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=51\n\"Edit section: Areas\")]\n\n  * [List of National Parks of the United States](/wiki/List_of_National_Parks_of_the_United_States \"List of National Parks of the United States\")\n  * [List of areas in the United States National Park System](/wiki/List_of_areas_in_the_United_States_National_Park_System \"List of areas in the United States National Park System\")\n  * [List of the United States National Park System official units](/wiki/List_of_the_United_States_National_Park_System_official_units \"List of the United States National Park System official units\")\n  * [National Heritage Area](/wiki/National_Heritage_Area \"National Heritage Area\")\n  * [National Memorial](/wiki/National_Memorial \"National Memorial\")\n  * [National Monument (United States)](/wiki/National_Monument_\\(United_States\\) \"National Monument \\(United States\\)\")\n\n###\nPeople[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=52\n\"Edit section: People\")]\n\n####\nIndividuals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Park_Service&action=edit&section=53\n\"Edit section: Individuals\")]\n\n  * [Ansel Franklin Hall](/wiki/Ansel_Franklin_Hall \"Ansel Franklin Hall\"), first Chief Naturalist and first Chief Forester of the National Park Service\n  * [William Kent (U.S. Congressman)](/wiki/William_Kent_\\(U.S._Congressman\\) \"William Kent \\(U.S. Congressman\\)\"), donated early parklands to the government\n  * [John F.
