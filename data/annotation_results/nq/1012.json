The reflection nebula [NGC 2023](/wiki/NGC_2023 \"NGC 2023\") is in the\nbottom left corner and the nebula itself near the center, in the shape of the\nhead of a horse.  \nObservation data: J2000.0 [epoch](/wiki/Epoch_\\(astronomy\\) \"Epoch\n\\(astronomy\\)\")  \n[Right ascension](/wiki/Right_ascension \"Right ascension\")|  05h 40m 59.0s  \n[Declination](/wiki/Declination \"Declination\")|  −02° 27′ 30.0\"  \nDistance|  1,500 [ly](/wiki/Light-year \"Light-year\")  \nApparent dimensions (V)|  8 × 6 [arcmins](/wiki/Minute_of_arc \"Minute of arc\")  \n[Constellation](/wiki/Constellation \"Constellation\")|\n[Orion](/wiki/Orion_\\(constellation\\) \"Orion \\(constellation\\)\")  \nPhysical characteristics  \n[Radius](/wiki/Radius \"Radius\")|  3.5 ly  \nNotable features|  Resembles a horse's head  \nDesignations|  Barnard 33,  \nLDN 1630,  \nSee also: [Lists of nebulae](/wiki/Category:Lists_of_nebulae \"Category:Lists\nof nebulae\")  \n  \nThe **Horsehead Nebula** (also known as **Barnard 33**) is a [dark\nnebula](/wiki/Dark_nebula \"Dark nebula\") in the constellation\n[Orion](/wiki/Orion_\\(constellation\\) \"Orion \\(constellation\\)\").[1] The\nnebula is located just to the south of the star [Alnitak](/wiki/Zeta_Orionis\n\"Zeta Orionis\"), which is farthest east on Orion's Belt, and is part of the\nmuch larger [Orion Molecular Cloud\nComplex](/wiki/Orion_Molecular_Cloud_Complex \"Orion Molecular Cloud Complex\").\nThe nebula was first recorded in 1888 by [Scottish](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\")\nastronomer [Williamina Fleming](/wiki/Williamina_Fleming \"Williamina Fleming\")\non photographic plate B2312 taken at the [Harvard\nCollege](/wiki/Harvard_College \"Harvard College\") Observatory.[2] The\nHorsehead Nebula is approximately 1500 [light years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light\nyear\") from Earth. It is one of the most identifiable nebulae because of the\nshape of its swirling cloud of dark dust and gases, which bears some\nresemblance to a [horse](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\")'s head when viewed from\nEarth.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Overview\n  * 2 Gallery\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Overview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Horsehead_Nebula&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Overview\")]\n\nThe dark cloud of dust and gas is a region in the Orion Molecular Cloud\nComplex where star formation is taking place. It is located in the\nconstellation of [Orion](/wiki/Orion_\\(constellation\\) \"Orion\n\\(constellation\\)\"), which is prominent in the winter evening sky in the\nNorthern Hemisphere and the summer evening sky in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThis [stellar nursery](/wiki/Stellar_nursery \"Stellar nursery\"), as it is\nknown, can contain over 100 known kinds of organic and inorganic gases as well\nas dust; some of the latter is made up of large and complex organic\nmolecules.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe red or pinkish glow originates from [hydrogen](/wiki/Hydrogen \"Hydrogen\")\ngas predominantly behind the nebula, ionized by the nearby bright star [Sigma\nOrionis](/wiki/Sigma_Orionis \"Sigma Orionis\"). [Magnetic\nfields](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic field\") channel the gases leaving the\nnebula into streams, shown as streaks in the background glow.[4] A glowing\nstrip of hydrogen gas marks the edge of the massive cloud, and the densities\nof nearby stars are noticeably different on either side.\n\nThe heavy concentrations of dust in the Horsehead Nebula region and\nneighbouring Orion Nebula are localized, resulting in alternating sections of\nnearly complete opacity and transparency.[5] The darkness of the Horsehead is\ncaused mostly by thick dust blocking the light of stars behind it.[6] The\nlower part of the Horsehead's neck casts a shadow to the left.[7] The visible\ndark nebula emerging from the gaseous complex is an active site of the\nformation of \"low-mass\" stars. Bright spots in the Horsehead Nebula's base are\nyoung stars just in the process of forming. It has a magnitude of\n.11.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\n## Gallery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Horsehead_Nebula&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Gallery\")]\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Horsehead_Nebula_and_Alnitak_%28WH_Pickering%3B_1888%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Horsehead_Nebula_and_Alnitak_\\(WH_Pickering;_1888\\).jpg)\n\nHorsehead Nebula and [Alnitak](/wiki/Alnitak \"Alnitak\") ([WH\nPickering](/wiki/William_Henry_Pickering \"William Henry Pickering\"); 1888).\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Horsehead_Nebula_H-alpha.jpg/156px-Horsehead_Nebula_H-alpha.jpg)](/wiki/File:Horsehead_Nebula_H-alpha.jpg)\n\nHorsehead Nebula captured with a H-alpha filter.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/The_Horsehead_Nebula_IC434.jpg/295px-The_Horsehead_Nebula_IC434.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Horsehead_Nebula_IC434.jpg)\n\nView with a regular telescope and camera.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Hubble_Sees_a_Horsehead_of_a_Different_Color.jpg/179px-Hubble_Sees_a_Horsehead_of_a_Different_Color.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hubble_Sees_a_Horsehead_of_a_Different_Color.jpg)\n\nView from the [HST](/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope \"Hubble Space Telescope\")\n(infrared).\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Reproduction_of_a_composite_colour_image_of_the_Horsehead_Nebula.jpg/182px-Reproduction_of_a_composite_colour_image_of_the_Horsehead_Nebula.jpg)](/wiki/File:Reproduction_of_a_composite_colour_image_of_the_Horsehead_Nebula.jpg)\n\nView from the [ESO](/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory \"European Southern\nObservatory\") (2002).\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Horse_Head_and_Flame_Nebula_Hydrogen_alpha_384mm_scope_stephan_hamel_wiki.jpg/251px-Horse_Head_and_Flame_Nebula_Hydrogen_alpha_384mm_scope_stephan_hamel_wiki.jpg)](/wiki/File:Horse_Head_and_Flame_Nebula_Hydrogen_alpha_384mm_scope_stephan_hamel_wiki.jpg)\n\nHorse Head and Flame Nebula Hydrogen alpha 384mm scope\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/HorseheadNebula-\nSofia-AnimatedScan-20160325.gif/500px-HorseheadNebula-Sofia-\nAnimatedScan-20160325.gif)](/wiki/File:HorseheadNebula-Sofia-\nAnimatedScan-20160325.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HorseheadNebula-Sofia-AnimatedScan-20160325.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Click Here for Animated\nmap](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sofia-\nhorsehead_1.gif) – Orion's Horsehead Nebula – yellow and white areas have the\nmost intense radiation from carbon atoms (March 2016).\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Horsehead_Nebula&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Horsehead Nebula in fiction](/wiki/Nebulae_in_fiction#Horsehead_Nebula \"Nebulae in fiction\")\n  * [List of Hubble anniversary images](/wiki/List_of_Hubble_anniversary_images \"List of Hubble anniversary images\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Horsehead_Nebula&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Arnett, Bill (2000).
