Hurricanes of such intensity\noccur once every three years in this region on average.\n\nOnly six times—in the [1932](/wiki/1932_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"1932\nAtlantic hurricane season\"), [1933](/wiki/1933_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"1933\nAtlantic hurricane season\"), [1961](/wiki/1961_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"1961\nAtlantic hurricane season\"), [2005](/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"2005\nAtlantic hurricane season\"), [2007](/wiki/2007_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"2007\nAtlantic hurricane season\"), and [2017](/wiki/2017_Atlantic_hurricane_season\n\"2017 Atlantic hurricane season\") hurricane seasons—has more than one Category\n5 recorded hurricane formed.

The NHC\nconsiders sustained wind speeds to be those that occur over a one-minute\nperiod at 10 metres (32.8 ft) above ground. These wind speeds are estimated by\nusing a blend of data from a variety of sources, which include observations\nfrom nearby ships, reconnaissance aircraft, or automatic weather stations and\npictures from various satellites.\n\nBetween [1924](/wiki/1924_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"1924 Atlantic hurricane\nseason\") and [2017](/wiki/2017_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"2017 Atlantic\nhurricane season\"), 33 hurricanes were recorded at Category 5 strength. No\nCategory 5 hurricanes were observed officially before 1924. It can be presumed\nthat earlier storms reached Category 5 strength over open waters, but the\nstrongest winds were not measured. The [anemometer](/wiki/Anemometer\n\"Anemometer\"), a device used for measuring wind speed, was invented in 1846.\nHowever, during major hurricane strikes the instruments as a whole were often\nblown away, leaving the hurricane's peak intensity unrecorded. For example, as\nthe [Great Beaufort Hurricane](/wiki/Great_Beaufort_Hurricane \"Great Beaufort\nHurricane\") of 1879 struck North Carolina, the anemometer cups were blown away\nwhen indicating 138 mph (222 km/h).[2]\n\nA [reanalysis](/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane_reanalysis \"Atlantic hurricane\nreanalysis\") of weather data is ongoing by researchers who may upgrade or\ndowngrade other Atlantic hurricanes currently listed at Categories 4 and 5.[3]\nFor example, the [1825 Santa Ana hurricane](/wiki/1825_Santa_Ana_hurricane\n\"1825 Santa Ana hurricane\") is suspected to have reached Category 5\nstrength.[4] Furthermore, [paleotempestological](/wiki/Paleotempestology\n\"Paleotempestology\") research aims to identify past major hurricanes by\ncomparing sedimentary evidence of recent and past hurricane strikes. For\nexample, a \"giant hurricane\" significantly more powerful than [Hurricane\nHattie](/wiki/Hurricane_Hattie \"Hurricane Hattie\") (Category 5) has been\nidentified in [Belizean](/wiki/Belize \"Belize\") sediment, having struck the\nregion sometime [before 1500](/wiki/Pre-1600_Atlantic_hurricane_seasons\n\"Pre-1600 Atlantic hurricane seasons\").[5]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/1924_Atlantic_hurricane_10_track.png/220px-1924_Atlantic_hurricane_10_track.png)](/wiki/File:1924_Atlantic_hurricane_10_track.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1924_Atlantic_hurricane_10_track.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn [October Category 5](/wiki/1924_Cuba_hurricane \"1924 Cuba hurricane\") that\nhit Cuba in [1924](/wiki/1924_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"1924 Atlantic\nhurricane season\")\n\nOfficially, the decade with the most Category 5 hurricanes is 2000–2009, with\neight Category 5 hurricanes having occurred: Isabel (2003), Ivan (2004), Emily\n(2005), Katrina (2005), Rita (2005), Wilma (2005), Dean (2007), and Felix\n(2007). The previous decades with the most Category 5 hurricanes were the\n1930s and 1960s, with six occurring between 1930 and 1939 (before naming\nbegan).[1]\n\nNine Atlantic hurricanes—[Camille](/wiki/Hurricane_Camille \"Hurricane\nCamille\"), [Allen](/wiki/Hurricane_Allen \"Hurricane Allen\"),\n[Andrew](/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew \"Hurricane Andrew\"),\n[Isabel](/wiki/Hurricane_Isabel \"Hurricane Isabel\"),\n[Ivan](/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan \"Hurricane Ivan\"), [Dean](/wiki/Hurricane_Dean\n\"Hurricane Dean\"), [Felix](/wiki/Hurricane_Felix \"Hurricane Felix\"),\n[Irma](/wiki/Hurricane_Irma \"Hurricane Irma\") and\n[Maria](/wiki/Hurricane_Maria \"Hurricane Maria\")—reached Category 5 intensity\non more than one occasion; that is, by reaching Category 5 intensity,\nweakening to a Category 4 or lower, and then becoming a Category 5 again. Such\nhurricanes have their dates shown together. Camille, Andrew, Dean, Felix,\nIrma, and Maria each attained Category 5 status twice during their lifespans.\nAllen, Isabel, and Ivan reached Category 5 intensity on three separate\noccasions. However, no Atlantic hurricane has reached Category 5 intensity\nmore than three times during its lifespan. The November 1932 Cuba hurricane\nholds the record for most time spent as a Category 5 (although it took place\nbefore satellite or aircraft reconnaissance, so this record may be somewhat\nsuspect). Irma holds the record for longest continuous span as a Category 5\nstorm in the satellite era.[1][6]\n\nThirty-three Category 5s have been recorded in the [Atlantic\nbasin](/wiki/Atlantic_basin \"Atlantic basin\") since 1851, when records began.\nOnly one Category 5 has been recorded in July, eight in August, nineteen in\nSeptember, five in October, and one in November. There have been no officially\nrecorded June or off-season Category 5 hurricanes.[1]\n\nThe July and August Category 5s reached their high intensities in both the\n[Gulf of Mexico](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of Mexico\") and the [Caribbean\nSea](/wiki/Caribbean_Sea \"Caribbean Sea\"). These are the areas most favorable\nfor tropical cyclone development in those months.[1][7]\n\nSeptember sees the most Category 5 hurricanes. This coincides with the\nclimatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which occurs in early\nSeptember.[8] September Category 5s reached their strengths in any of the\n[Gulf of Mexico](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of Mexico\"), [Caribbean\nSea](/wiki/Caribbean_Sea \"Caribbean Sea\"), and open Atlantic. These places are\nwhere September tropical cyclones are likely to form.[7] Many of these\nhurricanes are either [Cape Verde-type storms](/wiki/Cape_Verde_hurricane\n\"Cape Verde hurricane\"), which develop their strength by having a great deal\nof open water; or so-called Bahama busters, which intensify over the warm\n[Loop Current](/wiki/Loop_Current \"Loop Current\") in the Gulf of Mexico.[9]\n\nAll six Category 5s in October and November reached their intensities in the\nwestern Caribbean, a region that Atlantic hurricanes strongly gravitate toward\nlate in the season.[7] This is due to the climatology of the area, which\nsometimes has a high-altitude [anticyclone](/wiki/Anticyclone \"Anticyclone\")\nthat promotes rapid intensification late in the season, as well as warm\nwaters.\n\n##\nSystems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Category_5_Atlantic_hurricanes&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Systems\")]\n\nName | Dates as a  \nCategory 5 | Duration  \n( hours) | Sustained  \nwind speeds | Pressure | Areas affected | Deaths | Damage  \n(USD) | Refs  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCuba ![\"Cuba\"](/wiki/1924_Cuba_hurricane \"1924 Cuba hurricane\") | 19241019 !October 19, 1924 | 7001120000000000000♠12 | 165 !165 mph (270 km/h) | 7004910000000000000♠910 hPa (26.87 inHg) | Central America, Mexico, Cuba  \nFlorida, The Bahamas | 7001900000000000000♠90 |  | [10]  \nOkeechobee ![\"San Felipe II  \nOkeechobee\"](/wiki/1928_Okeechobee_hurricane \"1928 Okeechobee hurricane\") | 19280913 !September 13–14, 1928 | 7001120000000000000♠12 | 160 !160 mph (260 km/h) | 7004929000000000000♠929 hPa (27.43 inHg) | Lesser Antilles, The Bahamas  \nUnited States East Coast, Atlantic Canada | 7003400000000000000♠4,000 | 7008100000000000000♠$100 million |   \nBahamas ![\"Bahamas\"](/wiki/1932_Bahamas_hurricane \"1932 Bahamas hurricane\") | 19320905 !September 5–6, 1932 | 7001240000000000000♠24 | 160 !160 mph (260 km/h) | 7004921000000000000♠921 hPa (27.20 inHg) | The Bahamas, Northeastern United States | 7001160000000000000♠16 |  |   \nCuba ![\"Cuba\"](/wiki/1932_Cuba_hurricane \"1932 Cuba hurricane\") | 19321105 !November 5–8, 1932 | 7001780000000000000♠78 | 175 !175 mph (280 km/h) | 7004915000000000000♠915 hPa (27.02 inHg) | Lesser Antilles, Jamaica, Cayman Islands  \nCuba, The Bahamas, Bermuda | 7003310300000000000♠3,103 | 7007400000000000000♠$40 million |   \nCuba–Brownsville ![\"Cuba–Brownsville\"](/wiki/1933_Cuba%E2%80%93Brownsville_hurricane \"1933 Cuba–Brownsville hurricane\") | 19330830 !August 30, 1933 | 7001120000000000000♠12 | 160 !160 mph (260 km/h) | 7004930000000000000♠930 hPa (27.46 inHg) | The Bahamas, Cuba, Florida  \nTexas, Tamaulipas | 7002179000000000000♠179 | 7007279000000000000♠$27.9 million |   \nTampico ![\"Tampico\"](/wiki/1933_Tampico_hurricane \"1933 Tampico hurricane\") | 19330921 !September 21, 1933 | 7001120000000000000♠12 | 160 !160 mph (260 km/h) | 7004929000000000000♠929 hPa (27.43 inHg) | Jamaica, Yucatán Peninsula | 7002184000000000000♠184 | 7006500000000000000♠$5 million |   \nLabor Day ![\"Labor Day\"](/wiki/1935_Labor_Day_hurricane \"1935 Labor Day hurricane\") | 19350903 !September 3, 1935 | 7001180000000000000♠18 | 185 !185 mph (295 km/h) | 7004892000000000000♠892 hPa (26.34 inHg) | The Bahamas, Florida, Georgia, The Carolinas, Virginia | 7002408000000000000♠408 |  |   \nNew England !

\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Hurricane Camille](/wiki/Hurricane_Camille \"Hurricane Camille\"), a\nlandfalling Category 5\n\nAll Atlantic Category 5 hurricanes have made landfall at some location at\nhurricane strength. Most Category 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic make landfall\nbecause of their proximity to land in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, where\nthe usual synoptic weather patterns carry them towards land, as opposed to the\nwestward, oceanic mean track of Eastern Pacific hurricanes.[50] Sixteen of the\nstorms made landfall while at Category 5 intensity;[1] 2007 and 2017 are the\nonly years in which two storms made landfall at this intensity.[1]\n\nMany of these systems made landfall shortly after weakening from a Category 5.\nThis weakening can be caused by dry air near land, shallower waters due to\n[shelving](/wiki/Continental_shelf \"Continental shelf\"), interaction with\nland, or cooler waters near shore.[35] In southern Florida, the return period\nfor a Category 5 hurricane is roughly once every 50 years.[51]\n\nThe following table lists these hurricanes by [landfall](/wiki/Landfall\n\"Landfall\") intensity.\n\nName | Year |  **Category 5** |  **Category 4** |  **Category 3** |
