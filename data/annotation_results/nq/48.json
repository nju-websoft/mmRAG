Appearing in all three _Toy Story_ films, he usually acts\nas the leader of the gang. His rivalry with Buzz forms the basis of the plot\nof the first film. In _Toy Story 2_ , he is stolen at a yard sale by a toy\ncollector, causing the other toys to embark on a rescue mission. In _Toy Story\n3_ he and the other toys are shipped to a daycare center.\n\n### Buzz\nLightyear[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Buzz Lightyear\")]\n\nMain article: [Buzz Lightyear](/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear \"Buzz Lightyear\")\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [Tim Allen](/wiki/Tim_Allen \"Tim Allen\") (1995–present)\n  * [Patrick Warburton](/wiki/Patrick_Warburton \"Patrick Warburton\") (2000–2001) (_[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command](/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear_of_Star_Command \"Buzz Lightyear of Star Command\")_)\n  * [Pat Fraley](/wiki/Pat_Fraley \"Pat Fraley\") (_[Toy Story Treats](/wiki/Toy_Story_Treats \"Toy Story Treats\")_ , few video games, merchandise, attractions) (1996–2005)\n  * [Mike MacRae](/wiki/Mike_MacRae \"Mike MacRae\") (video games) (2010–present)\n  * Javier Fernandez-Peña (Spanish Buzz)\n\nPreviously known as **Tinny** and **Lunar Larry** , **[Buzz\nLightyear](/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear \"Buzz Lightyear\")** is a modern-day \"space\nranger\" action figure, and wears a green and white space suit with various\nfeatures such as retractable wings and transparent air helmet, a laser\n\"weapon,\" and various sound effects. In the films, he acts as Woody's second-\nin-command. In _Toy Story_ , he begins the series believing he is a real space\nranger (the other toys are aware that they are toys) and develops a rivalry\nwith Woody, who resents him for getting more attention as the newcomer. During\nthe film, he comes to realize that he is just a toy, and eventually becomes\ngood friends with Woody. He is extremely loyal to his friends. During his time\ntrapped at Sid's house, Hannah, Sid's sister, called Buzz Mrs. Nesbit. In _Toy\nStory 2_ , Buzz goes to save Woody from Al with Potato Head, Hamm, Rex, and\nSlink (Slinky Dog) where he gets stuck in the Buzz Lightyear aisle in Al's Toy\nBarn by another Buzz and finds out for himself what he was really like. In\n_Toy Story 3_ , a relationship begins to develop between Buzz and Jessie. He\nis particularly open with his affection when accidentally switched to \"Spanish\nmode.\"\n\n###\nJessie[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Jessie\")]\n\nMain article: [Jessie (Toy Story)](/wiki/Jessie_\\(Toy_Story\\) \"Jessie \\(Toy\nStory\\)\")\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [Joan Cusack](/wiki/Joan_Cusack \"Joan Cusack\") (1999–present)\n  * [Mary Kay Bergman](/wiki/Mary_Kay_Bergman \"Mary Kay Bergman\") (yodeling voice) _Toy Story 2_\n  * [Sarah McLachlan](/wiki/Sarah_McLachlan \"Sarah McLachlan\") (singing voice) _Toy Story 2_\n  * [Kathryn Cressida](/wiki/Kathryn_Cressida \"Kathryn Cressida\") (_[Disney Infinity](/wiki/Disney_Infinity_\\(video_game\\) \"Disney Infinity \\(video game\\)\")_)\n\n**[Jessie](/wiki/Jessie_\\(Toy_Story\\) \"Jessie \\(Toy Story\\)\")** is a cowgirl\ndoll, and part of the Woody's Round Up gang. Jessie is also Buzz Lightyear's\ngirlfriend. She first appeared in _Toy Story 2_ along with Bullseye (her\nhorse) and Stinky Pete. Initially, Jessie was hesitant to join Andy's friends.\nAfter she becomes part of the family, she is very happy (despite that Andy\nfirst calls her Bazooka Jane). In _Toy Story 3_ , she was riding Bullseye when\nWoody fell off the train in Andy's opening sequence. She argued with Woody on\ntheir way to Sunnyside Daycare because of when the others think Andy threw\nthem out. Later in the film, Jessie feels close with Buzz, even when Buzz got\nswitched into Spanish. At the end, Jessie and Buzz danced to the Spanish\nversion of \"You've Got a Friend in Me.\" Jessie also makes a cameo appearance\nin _[Monsters, Inc.](/wiki/Monsters,_Inc. \"Monsters, Inc.\")_ as one of the\ntoys Boo gives Sulley. Jessie also appears in Pixar's production of _[Toy\nStory of Terror!](/wiki/Toy_Story_of_Terror! \"Toy Story of Terror!\")_ as the\nmain character that saves the other toys from the toy stealer and seller at\nthe rest stop.\n\n## Toy characters by\nowner[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Toy characters by owner\")]\n\n### Andy's\ntoys[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Andy's toys\")]\n\n#### Hamm the Piggy\nBank[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Hamm the Piggy Bank\")]\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [John Ratzenberger](/wiki/John_Ratzenberger \"John Ratzenberger\") (1995–present)\n  * [Andrew Stanton](/wiki/Andrew_Stanton \"Andrew Stanton\") (_[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins](/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear_of_Star_Command:_The_Adventure_Begins \"Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins\")_)\n\n**Hamm** is a wisecracking realist [piggy bank](/wiki/Piggy_bank \"Piggy bank\")\nwith a [cork](/wiki/Cork_\\(material\\) \"Cork \\(material\\)\") in his belly in\nplace of a stopper. He and Mr. Potato Head appear to be best friends, and are\noften seen playing games, such as [Battleship](/wiki/Battleship_\\(game\\)\n\"Battleship \\(game\\)\") (with Hamm always winning). Out of all the toys, he is\nshown to have the most knowledge of the outside, often being very familiar\nwith various gadgets that are shown, likely as an homage to Ratzenberger's\nfamous role of mail carrier and bar know-it-all [Cliff\nClavin](/wiki/Cliff_Clavin \"Cliff Clavin\") on the sitcom\n_[Cheers](/wiki/Cheers \"Cheers\")_.\n\nIn _Toy Story_ , Hamm interrupts Woody's staff meeting by alerting the crowd\ntelling them that the birthday guests are arriving at 3:00. Hamm becomes\nfascinated with Buzz's features and ridicules of Woody, along with Potato\nHead. When Woody inadvertently knocks Buzz off the window, Hamm is one of the\nmany toys who believes that Woody did it intentionally and he turns on him.\nHowever, Hamm realizes the truth that Buzz is alive. At the end, Hamm cheers\nfor Potato Head when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head for Christmas.\n\nIn _Toy Story 2_ , Hamm resents the Al's Toy Barn chicken mascot. When Woody\nis stolen, he and Mr. Potato Head organize a crime scene to present Woody's\nkidnapping to the other toys. After helping the toys find the Al's Toy Barn\ncommercial on TV, Hamm goes with Buzz, Slinky, Rex, and Mr. Potato Head on a\nmission to rescue Woody. In Al's Toy Barn, Hamm spots a \"Bonus Belt\" Buzz,\nthinking he is Andy's Buzz, though he comments on the new Buzz's odd behavior.\nWhile following Al to the airport on a pizza planet delivery truck, he and Mr.\nPotato Head operate the truck's levers and knobs and are advised to pull the\ngear lever to get the truck to move. While reading the truck's manual, he\nstates \"I seriously doubt he's getting this kinda mileage\". Eventually, Hamm\nand the other toys are able to rescue Woody and are able to return home in a\nstolen baggage carrier.\n\nIn _Toy Story 3_ , Hamm is \"Evil Dr. Porkchop\" in Andy's western play opening\nsequence, appearing in a giant pig-shaped spaceship to rescue One-Eyed Bart\nand thwart Woody and his gang. Later, when the toys are accidentally thrown\nout, Hamm is angry, believing that Andy threw them out on purpose. He escapes\nwith the rest of the toys to Sunnyside Daycare, where he is initially happy to\nbe played with, but dismayed as he realizes the toddlers are too rough. Later\nthat night, Hamm and his friends realize that Woody was telling the truth\nabout Andy. When the toys are imprisoned by Lotso and his henchmen, Hamm is\nshown to be able to play the harmonica. When Woody comes back to rescue the\ntoys from Sunnyside he quotes \"Return of the Astro-Nut\" on Buzz being turned\nback to demo. He helps the toys escape by fighting with Rex to distract Buzz,\nwho has been switched to demo mode by Lotso, so that Jessie can trap him under\na plastic container. Hamm and Rex, being the heaviest of the toys, sit on top\nof the container to prevent Buzz from escaping. When Woody returns with Buzz's\ninstruction manual to switch him back, Hamm reads the instructions while the\nothers hold Buzz down. When they were about to die in the incinerator, Hamm\ngrabbed the hands of Slinky and Rex. Later, after the toys are rescued from an\nincinerator-related death at the dump due to Lotso's selfishness, Hamm, along\nwith Slinky, wants revenge, but Woody talks them both out of it. He is donated\nalong with Andy's other toys to Bonnie, where he becomes best friends with\nButtercup.\n\nIn a 2010 advertisement for the [United States Postal\nService](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service \"United States Postal Service\")\npromoting _Toy Story 3,_ Hamm wears a postal worker's hat while promoting the\nPriority Mail service; Ratzenberger is best known for his role as mailman\n[Cliff Clavin](/wiki/Cliff_Clavin \"Cliff Clavin\") on the long-running sitcom\n_[Cheers](/wiki/Cheers \"Cheers\")_. He also makes an appearance in the _Toy\nStory 3_ video game as the mayor in Toy Box mode.\n\nHamm also appears in the theatrical short films _[Hawaiian\nVacation](/wiki/Hawaiian_Vacation \"Hawaiian Vacation\"),_ _[Small\nFry](/wiki/Small_Fry_\\(film\\) \"Small Fry \\(film\\)\")_ and _[Partysaurus\nRex](/wiki/Partysaurus_Rex \"Partysaurus Rex\")._\n\n#### Rex the Tyrannosaurus\nRex[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Rex the Tyrannosaurus Rex\")]\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [Wallace Shawn](/wiki/Wallace_Shawn \"Wallace Shawn\") (1995–present)\n  * [Earl Boen](/wiki/Earl_Boen \"Earl Boen\") (video games)\n\n**Rex** is an excitable large, green, plastic _[Tyrannosaurus\nRex](/wiki/Tyrannosaurus_Rex \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\")_. Rex suffers from anxiety,\nan [inferiority complex](/wiki/Inferiority_complex \"Inferiority complex\") and\nthe concern that he is not scary enough. Rex's worst fear (after Sid) is that\nAndy will get another, scarier dinosaur. He is among the largest of Andy's\ntoys, and is often depicted as the heaviest. He is voiced by [Earl\nBoen](/wiki/Earl_Boen \"Earl Boen\") in the video games _[Toy Story 2: Buzz\nLightyear to the Rescue](/wiki/Toy_Story_2:_Buzz_Lightyear_to_the_Rescue \"Toy\nStory 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue\")_ (1999) and _[Toy Story\nRacer](/wiki/Toy_Story_Racer \"Toy Story Racer\")_ (2001). Although Rex is a toy\ndinosaur he dislikes confrontation and is sensitive in nature.\n\nIn _Toy Story_ , he states that he was manufactured by a smaller company that\nwas purchased in a leveraged buyout by [Mattel](/wiki/Mattel \"Mattel\")\n(coincidentally, real-life Rex toys used to be made by [Hasbro](/wiki/Hasbro\n\"Hasbro\"), but as of 2009 are indeed made by Mattel). He is first introduced\nwhen he moves Woody's doodle pad, then tries to scare Woody with his roar.\nWhen Buzz arrives, Rex is fascinated by his cool features. Later, when Woody\nknocks Buzz out the window, he reluctantly sides against Woody out of pressure\nfrom the other toys. He is, however, a great deal less antagonistic than most\nof the other toys. He later feels guilty when everyone discovers Woody was\ntelling the truth all along. He gains confidence at the end, saying he could\nplay as the dominant predator if Andy gets a leaf eater.\n\nThe beginning of _Toy Story 2_ , he is shown playing the \"Buzz Lightyear:\nAttack on Zurg\" video game, which he loses, much to his frustration. He is\nresponsible for the toys seeing the commercial for Al's Toy Barn commercial\nwhen he accidentally clicks the remote control. When Woody was kidnapped by\nAl, Rex tried to send a message to the FBI for help, but he didn't know how to\nwrite FBI, and later joins Buzz' team to rescue Woody. Inside Al's Toy Barn,\nhe excitedly finds a \"Buzz Lightyear\" video game strategy guide, which he\ntakes with him. He loses the guide later, but is still able to give Buzz two\ntips from the guide on defeating Zurg. In a parody of [_Jurassic\nPark_](/wiki/Jurassic_Park_\\(film\\) \"Jurassic Park \\(film\\)\"), he chases a car\ndriven by the toys in Al's Toy Barn, in which Mr. Potato Head spots his\nreflection in the rear view mirror. It is Rex's tail sticking out of Al's bag\nthat later causes the real Buzz to go after them. When the other Toys, led by\nBuzz 2 reach Al's Apartment, the toys use an unwilling Rex as a battering ram\nto break in against the unlocked grate. When Zurg is about to finish off Buzz\n2, he turns away, not bearing to look anymore, but his tail knocks Zurg down\nthe elevator shaft, making him feel overjoyed about finally defeating Zurg for\nreal. While following Al to the airport on a pizza planet delivery truck, he\nserves as the navigator and tells Buzz which way to go since he can't see out\nthe window while controlling the steering wheel. Eventually, he and the others\nmanage to rescue Woody and return home in a stolen baggage carrier.\n\nIn _Toy Story 3_ , he is Woody's \"Dinosaur who Eats Force Field Dogs\" in\nAndy's opening western play sequence, where he frightens One-Eyed Bart and his\ngang with a terrifying roar, but is then overpowered by a flood of monkeys. He\nis seen to be especially sad about Andy's lack of attention to the toys,\nexpressing joy when Andy touches him for only a few moments. When the toys are\ninitially left for the garbage pickup, he is ultimately responsible for saving\nthem when they use his tail to rip a hole in the garbage bag. He is initially\nhappy to be at Sunnyside, and is visibly sad when Woody leaves, but becomes\ndismayed after a rough playtime with the toddlers, commenting \"Andy never\nplayed with us like that!\" He is imprisoned along with Andy's other toys by\nLotso and his gang. Later, at the garbage dump, Rex is the last to escape the\nshredder, only barely escaping when he grabs onto a broken fan. He discovers a\nsource of light thinking that it's daylight, but Woody convinces him that it's\nnot; it's the light of the flame from the [incinerator](/wiki/Incineration\n\"Incineration\"). When the toys are finally given to Bonnie, Rex becomes close\nfriends with Trixie the Triceratops.\n\nIn an outtake of _Toy Story 2_ , when used as a battering ram, Rex hurt his\nhead when banged against the locked grate. Rex makes an appearance in an\nouttake of _[Monsters, Inc.](/wiki/Monsters,_Inc. \"Monsters, Inc.\")_ where he\nwaits at the crosswalk with Mike and Sulley in a scene reminiscent of\n_[Jurassic Park](/wiki/Jurassic_Park_\\(film\\) \"Jurassic Park \\(film\\)\")_. Rex\nis a playable character in the _[Toy Story Racer](/wiki/Toy_Story_Racer \"Toy\nStory Racer\")_ video game. In the movie _[WALL-E](/wiki/WALL-E \"WALL-E\")_ ,\nRex is seen in the background inside WALL-E's truck.\n\nRex reappears in the theatrical short films _[Hawaiian\nVacation](/wiki/Hawaiian_Vacation \"Hawaiian Vacation\")_ , _[Small\nFry](/wiki/Small_Fry_\\(film\\) \"Small Fry \\(film\\)\")_ , _[Partysaurus\nRex](/wiki/Partysaurus_Rex \"Partysaurus Rex\")_ and in the TV specials _[Toy\nStory of Terror!](/wiki/Toy_Story_of_Terror! \"Toy Story of Terror!\")_ , and\n_[Toy Story That Time Forgot](/wiki/Toy_Story_That_Time_Forgot \"Toy Story That\nTime Forgot\")_.\n\n#### Slinky\nDog[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Slinky Dog\")]\n\n\"Slinky Dog\" redirects here. For the original toy, see [Slinky – Slinky Dog\n(section)](/wiki/Slinky#Slinky_Dog \"Slinky\").\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [Jim Varney](/wiki/Jim_Varney \"Jim Varney\") (1995–1999)\n  * [Blake Clark](/wiki/Blake_Clark \"Blake Clark\") (2010–present)\n  * [Darryl Kurylo](/wiki/Darryl_Kurylo \"Darryl Kurylo\") (_Toy Story Racer_)\n\n**Slinky Dog** (usually called just **Slinky** or sometimes **Slink**) is a\ntoy [dachshund](/wiki/Dachshund \"Dachshund\") with a metal\n[Slinky](/wiki/Slinky \"Slinky\") for a body, who speaks with a southern accent.\nSlinky's head, feet, and tail are plastic and he is missing his pull string.\nSlinky also has a green collar. Slinky Dog is based on [Slinky](/wiki/Slinky\n\"Slinky\"), a pull toy by James Industries, which was popular in the 1950s,\n1960s and early 1970s. With the permission of James Industries, Slinky Dog was\npartially redesigned for the film by Pixar artist [Bud\nLuckey](/wiki/Bud_Luckey \"Bud Luckey\") to make him more appealing as an\nanimated character.\n\nIn _Toy Story_ , he likes playing checkers with Woody, usually choosing the\nred side. Slinky is shown to be the most loyal to Woody and stands up for him\nwhen Potato Head complains. Slinky is fascinated by Buzz, along with the rest\nof the toys, but does not make fun of Woody when Buzz arrives like the others\ndo. When Woody knocks Buzz out of the window, Slinky is one of the few toys\nwho believes it was an accident. Later, when Andy notices Woody is missing, he\nand Bo Peep are worried about him, in contrast to the others, who are glad\nhe's gone. Later, he attempts to help when Woody throws a chain of Christmas\nlights from Sid's house to Andy's, but Potato Head stops him. Even Slinky\nappears to give up on Woody when he pretends Buzz is with him but accidentally\nreveals his broken arm. He is stretched almost to the point of breaking when\nhelping rescue Woody and Buzz on the moving truck, but is fixed by the end of\nthe film.\n\nAt the beginning of _Toy Story 2_ , Slinky is the one who finds Woody's hat,\nand joins Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head and Rex on a mission to rescue Woody\nfrom Al McWhiggin. His springy coil is used as a bungee cord when the toys\njump from the roof of Andy's house. When the toys break into Al's apartment,\nSlinky uses his spring to hold Jessie and Bullseye back by coiling them up so\nthe toys can safely rescue Woody. After Al packs up Woody and his Roundup gang\nand heads for the airport, Slinky, stretching down from the elevator ceiling\nby Buzz, Hamm and Potato Head, reaches for the case that contains Woody, and\nalmost manages to save him, but is thwarted by the Prospector. While following\nAl to the airport on a pizza planet delivery truck, he operates the truck's\ngas and brake pedals. They manage to reach the airport and use a pet carrier\nto get inside. When a girl approaches them (mistaking the toys for a puppy),\nSlinky barks to scare her off to prevent their discovery. After rescuing\nWoody, they return home with the rest of the group in a stolen baggage\ncarrier. In an outtake, he is seen petting his own hind section and talking to\nit.\n\nIn _Toy Story 3_ , Slinky has a smaller role compared to the previous two\nfilms. He is the only original character that had to be re-cast (due to Jim\nVarney's death), and was replaced by Blake Clark (with a professional Jim\nVarney voice) in this film. Slinky is One-Eyed Bart's \"Attack Dog with a\nBuilt-in Force Field\" and protects the bad guys with his shield in Andy's\nwestern play sequence. At Sunnyside Daycare, Slinky has been tangled up by the\nyoung children. Later that night, Slinky reveals that Woody was telling them\nthe truth about Andy's intention to store the toys into the attic. Slinky and\nhis friends are imprisoned by Lotso's gang. He is shown to be the happiest toy\nto see Woody return, and assists him in subduing the Monkey toy who monitors\nthe security cameras. When the toys reach the dumpster, Slinky stretches\nhimself to create a bridge for the toys to climb across to safety, although\nthey are stopped by Lotso. When the toys end up at the dump, Slinky is the\nfirst to be taken up by a magnetic ceiling due to the metallic section\n(_Slinky_) of his body. When Lotso betrays the toys and leaves them to be\nburned up in the incinerator, Slinky is the first to follow Buzz in joining\nhands in acceptance of their fate. After the toys are rescued by the Squeeze\nToy Aliens, he and Hamm are the most vocal about wanting to get revenge on\nLotso for leaving them to die before Woody convinces them Lotso isn't worth\nit. He is eventually donated to Bonnie along with the rest of the toys.\n\nHis catchphrase, said in all three movies, is \"Golly bob-howdy!\"\n\nSlinky reappears in the short film _[Hawaiian\nVacation](/wiki/Hawaiian_Vacation \"Hawaiian Vacation\")_ , in which he acts as\na hotel porter as part of Ken and Barbie's Hawaiian adventures. He also\nappears in _[Small Fry](/wiki/Small_Fry_\\(film\\) \"Small Fry \\(film\\)\")_ and\n_[Partysaurus Rex](/wiki/Partysaurus_Rex \"Partysaurus Rex\")_. He does not\nspeak in _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins_ , silently\nappearing along with Jessie in one scene.\n\n#### Mr. Potato\nHead[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Mr. Potato Head\")]\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [Don Rickles](/wiki/Don_Rickles \"Don Rickles\") (1995–2014)\n  * [TBA](/wiki/To_be_announced \"To be announced\") (2019)\n\n**Mr. Potato Head** (often referred to as simply **Potato Head**) is a\nBrooklyn-accented doll based on the real-life toy [Mr. Potato\nHead](/wiki/Mr._Potato_Head \"Mr. Potato Head\") by [Playskool](/wiki/Playskool\n\"Playskool\"). He is an outspoken and sarcastic potato-shaped toy: his patented\ndesign allows him to separate his detachable parts from his body by removing\nthem from the holes on his body. He also has a compartment on his lower back\nto store extra appendages. He is capable of retaining control over his parts\neven if they are several meters away from his main body. For example, he can\nstill see if one or both of his detachable eyes are removed, as well as being\nable to move his hands if they are detached. The same thing applies to his\n\"Mrs.\" counterpart, as she was able to see Andy in his room through her eye\nleft behind. While this attribute is mostly used for comedic effect (i.e. as a\nrunning gag, he often finds himself being split or falling apart due to\noutside forces), it does have its uses, particularly in the second and third\nfilms.\n\nIn _Toy Story_ , it is hinted that he used to be Andy's favorite toy years\nbefore the events of the film, until he received Woody at the point of\nkindergarten, and therefore seems to have a strong jealousy towards Andy`s\nlove for Woody. Then, when Andy gets the Buzz Lightyear action figure for his\nbirthday he becomes fascinated with all of Buzz's features and ridicules Woody\nfor not having a laser like Buzz as well as Woody's pull-string. After Buzz is\nknocked out of the window, Potato Head (perhaps due to his jealously towards\nWoody, and wanting to reclaim his long lost favorite toy position) blames\nWoody for kicking him out, thinking that Woody might do the same to him if\nAndy plays with him more often, and turns the other toys against Woody and\nleads a mutiny with them. When Woody reveals himself at Sid's House later, Mr.\nPotato Head convinces the others to refuse to help him, still assuming that\nWoody attacked Buzz. But when they are packed up Mr. Potato Head is still\nunhappy because he is stuck with Rex as a moving buddy and put in a moving\ntruck. Later when Woody catches up with them and tosses RC onto the street to\nrescue Buzz, Potato Head, still distrusting Woody (and perhaps still eager to\nreclaim his favorite toy position), orders the other toys to mutiny again, and\n\"toss him overboard\", however, when Bo Peep reveals that \"Woody was telling\nthe truth,\" the toys realize their mistake. He decides to reform himself as an\napology to Woody by holding Slinky's tail to help Woody and Buzz back at the\ntruck but gets hit after Slinky's attempt fails. When Woody tosses RC in the\ntruck, Potato Head gets hit. At the end of the film, he is surprised to hear\nMolly receiving Mrs. Potato Head for her Christmas present and promptly\ndecides to shave by removing his mustache.\n\nIn _Toy Story 2_ , after Al McWhiggin steals Woody, he goes with Buzz, Hamm,\nRex, and Slinky to rescue Woody. Later, when they are going to leave, Mrs.\nPotato Head packs some extra pair of shoes and angry eyes on his back\ncompartment. When the toys cross the street to Al's Toy Barn, they cause a\nsemi to jackknife, and the chains restraining a large pipe on the semi break,\nfreeing the pipe, which rolls down the street, during which Mr. Potato Head\ngets one of his feet stuck in a chewing gum and has to pull his foot off the\ngum before the pipe can crush him. After the toys break into Al's room using\nRex as a battering ram, Potato Head attempts to frighten\n[Jessie](/wiki/Jessie_\\(Toy_Story\\) \"Jessie \\(Toy Story\\)\") by reaching into\nhis back compartment for his angry eyes, but attaches his spare pair of shoes\nby mistake. When the toys leave the apartment after Al leaves with Woody,\nPotato Head throws his hat like a frisbee to jam the closing doors, letting\nthe toys pass through. Outside, he is the first to spot an idling Pizza Planet\ndelivery truck nearby. While the toys chase Al in the truck, Potato Head and\nHamm operate the truck's levers and knobs and are advised by three alien toys\nto pull the truck's gear lever to get the truck to move. He later saves the\nalien toys from flying out the window. In the airport, when he sees the\nluggage area, he gasps and his angry eyes and pair of shoes come out after his\ncompartment opens. He feels annoyed when the aliens repeatedly express their\neternal gratefulness towards him, but after the toys return home in a stolen\nbaggage carrier, he reluctantly gives in when his wife wants to adopt the\naliens, much to his dismay. In an outtake, he is seen taking a dislike with\nthe Barrel of Monkeys, saying he is \"drawing the line at monkeys\" and wants to\ncall his agent.\n\nIn _Toy Story 3_ , Potato Head is resentful of the aliens, who still worship\nhim for saving their lives. Potato Head is sad that Andy doesn't play with\nthem anymore, and complains all that to Woody. He is frustrated that Andy\n\"threw them away\", when he was actually going to put them in the attic. Again,\nPotato Head is the toy most doubtful of Woody when he and the other toys are\nalmost thrown away by accident. Potato Head is excited to get played with in\nSunnyside. After a rough playtime with the toddlers, he and Mrs. Potato Head's\nparts are scattered on the floor, and he gets his parts stuck up a kid's mouth\nand nose. Later that night, his wife Mrs. Potato Head through the other eye\nleft in Andy's bedroom, spots that Andy is looking for his toys, making Mr.\nPotato Head and the other toys shocked. When Lotso's dark attitude is\nrevealed, he tries to defend his friends from Lotso, but Big Baby throws him\ninto [\"The Box\"](/wiki/Solitary_confinement \"Solitary confinement\") on Lotso's\norders. When Jessie told Woody she was wrong to leave Andy, Potato Head agrees\nsaying that she was wrong. The toys hatch an escape plan which Potato Head\ninitiates by arguing with and distracting the captors, and he is thrown in the\nbox once again. Only his smaller parts are able to escape, through a small\nhole. He reassembles onto a floppy [tortilla](/wiki/Tortilla \"Tortilla\"),\nchecks if Lotso is sleeping and then gives the signal. Pecked at by a pigeon,\nthe tortilla falls apart, and Potato Head rejoins the other toys using a\n[cucumber](/wiki/Cucumber \"Cucumber\") for a body. Bullseye returns his\noriginal plastic body to him. The toys manage to escape Sunnyside, and he and\nthe other toys jump onto a garbage truck. Eventually, they end up in a\nlandfill, facing death in the incinerator. However, Potato Head and the toys\nare saved by his alien children, who he now accepts and declares himself to be\neternally grateful, just as the aliens had told him when they met. They\neventually return to Andy's home and get washed. Mr. Potato Head then says his\nfarewell to Woody before Andy comes into the room. Potato Head is donated to\nBonnie at the end of the film.\n\nPotato Head reappears in the theatrical short films _[Hawaiian\nVacation](/wiki/Hawaiian_Vacation \"Hawaiian Vacation\")_ , _[Small\nFry](/wiki/Small_Fry_\\(film\\) \"Small Fry \\(film\\)\")_ , and _[Partysaurus\nRex](/wiki/Partysaurus_Rex \"Partysaurus Rex\")_ , and appears in _Toy Story of\nTerror!_ and _Toy Story That Time Forgot_. Mr. Potato Head's actor, Don\nRickles, however died in 2017 so his voice actor is currently unknown for\n2019's upcoming film, Toy Story 4.[1][2]\n\nHe is seen as an [Interactive](/wiki/Interactivity \"Interactivity\") [Audio-\nAnimatronic](/wiki/Audio-Animatronics \"Audio-Animatronics\") at _[Toy Story\nMidway Mania!](/wiki/Toy_Story_Midway_Mania! \"Toy Story Midway Mania!\")_. It\nis stated on the _Toy Story_ website that Mr. Potato Head was Andy's second\ntoy.\n\n#### Mrs. Potato\nHead[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Mrs. Potato Head\")]\n\nVoiced by [Estelle Harris](/wiki/Estelle_Harris \"Estelle Harris\")\n(1999–present)\n\n**Mrs. Potato Head** is Mr. Potato Head's wife and female counterpart. Unlike\nher husband, Mrs. Potato Head is sweet and not hot-headed or impatient.\nAlthough mentioned as one of Molly's Christmas presents near the end of the\nfirst movie, she is not seen until _Toy Story 2_.\n\nIn _Toy Story 2_ , her husband has found her lost earring. Before her husband\nleaves with Buzz and his troops, she stores his \"extra pair of\n[shoes](/wiki/Shoe \"Shoe\") and angry [eyes](/wiki/Eye \"Eye\")\" into his back\ncompartment. She also warns the toys by saying \"Don't talk to any toy you\ndon't know!\" She is not seen again until the end of the film. She becomes an\nadoptive mother of the three Squeeze Toy Aliens that Andy's toys had found in\nthe Pizza Planet truck, as they will not leave because Mr. Potato Head saved\ntheir lives. She is then happily watching Wheezy sing his version of \"You've\nGot a Friend in Me\" with her husband.\n\nIn _Toy Story 3_ , she has a more central role. She is \"One-Eyed Betty\", One-\nEyed Bart's wife in the opening sequence. She uses her ninja skills and her\nnunchuk to herd Woody to the back, and eventually off the train. After One-\nEyed Bart and Betty rob tons of gold, they are transported to Dr. Porkchop's\naircraft. At the present time when Andy's toys all cram themselves in the toy\nbox, Mrs. Potato Head loses one of her eyes. She is one of the toys who\nbelieve Andy threw them out on purpose. They are later donated to Sunnyside\nDaycare. She and her husband experience a rough playtime with the toddlers at\nthe Caterpillar Room. When the toys hear something from the halls, Mrs. Potato\nHead uses her eye and looks under the door. She at first just sees the dark\nhall, but then she sees Andy looking for the toys in his room, due to the eye\nshe left behind in Andy's house. She tells the toys it truly was an accident\nthat they were thrown away. When Lotso is revealed to be evil, Mrs. Potato\nHead complains about her chewed up pocketbook and yells at him when he calls\nher \"Sweet Potato,\" along with telling him she needs more respect and having\nover 30 accessories. But Lotso takes off her mouth. Near the end of the film,\nshe is saved from death in an incinerator by her adoptive children, and much\nto her delight, her husband now accepts them. She recovers her missing eye\nbefore she and the toys are donated to Bonnie. Even though she was Molly's\n[Christmas](/wiki/Christmas \"Christmas\") gift in the first film, the second\nand third films imply that she is one of Andy's toys.\n\nMrs. Potato Head reappears in the theatrical short film _[Hawaiian\nVacation](/wiki/Hawaiian_Vacation \"Hawaiian Vacation\")_ and acts as a tour\nguide for Ken and Barbie in their Hawaiian adventures. She also reappears in\n_[Small Fry](/wiki/Small_Fry_\\(film\\) \"Small Fry \\(film\\)\")_ and _[Partysaurus\nRex](/wiki/Partysaurus_Rex \"Partysaurus Rex\")_.\n\n####\nBullseye[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Bullseye\")]\n\nVocal effects by [Frank Welker](/wiki/Frank_Welker \"Frank Welker\")\n(1999–present)\n\n**Bullseye** is a toy [horse](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\") who was introduced in _Toy\nStory 2_. He is the first toy with which Woody interacted in Al's penthouse.\nHe was very happy to finally see Woody after a long time in storage. Bullseye\nis shown to loathe fights as he hides in a can when Jessie jumps on Woody. He\nis also upset at Woody's intention to abandon the Roundup gang to return to\nAndy, as Bullseye does not want Woody to leave. When Woody ultimately decides\nto return to Andy's room, it is Bullseye's loyalty that causes Woody to try to\nget the other toys to join him. At the airport, after Bullseye escapes from\nAl's case, Woody and Buzz Lightyear mount Bullseye and gallop across the\nairfield to rescue Jessie from being sent to Japan. Although Woody gets\nseparated from Buzz, Buzz commandeers Bullseye to follow Woody, as they are\nseen galloping next to the wheels of the plane Woody and Jessie are on as it\nheads down the runway. The mission finally ends when Woody and Jessie swing\ndown from the plane and land on Bullseye right behind Buzz, seconds before the\nplane takes off. After the toys return home, both Bullseye and Jessie become\npart of Andy's toys. Bullseye has every letter of Andy's name printed on the\nsole of each of his hooves.\n\nBullseye returns in _Toy Story 3_ as one of the remaining toys in Andy's room.\nHe is still Woody's horse in the opening sequence and saves him when he falls\noff the train by One-Eyed Betty. Bullseye's fast speed helps Woody catch the\ntrain and rescue the orphans. Bullseye is really sad when Andy wouldn't play\nwith them anymore. After Andy's mother thought the bag that the toys were in\nwas trash, Bullseye and the toys manage to safely hide in a recycling bin. The\ntoys are donated to Sunnyside Daycare. At Sunnyside, he proves his loyalty to\nWoody when he makes clear he wants to stay with him. He only stays when Woody\ntells him to since Woody doesn't want him to be alone in the attic. Bullseye\nis roughly tumbled over by a screaming toddler with a rolling wheel toy. After\nthe toddler play session, Bullseye is covered with paint and has a blue\nsticker in his snout, which is removed by Jessie. When Lotso is revealed to be\nevil, he locks the toys up and shows them Woody's hat, making Bullseye miss\nWoody and sad he's gone. Bullseye is extremely happy when Woody comes back to\nSunnyside and gives him back his hat. The toys then plan an escape. Bullseye\nhelps by going through the playground, carrying the aliens on his back. He\ngoes with Woody and is almost caught by Big Baby when Bullseye jumps and\naccidentally makes an alien fall and squeak. But they hide inside a pail\nsafely. The toys then go to the garbage dump, and Bullseye is the most\ndesperate to escape from the incinerator. They are rescued by the three\naliens. At the end, Bullseye is donated to Bonnie, along with the rest of the\ntoys. In Bonnie's room Bullseye changes the channel of a radio to a Spanish\nchannel causing Buzz and Jessie to dance to the Spanish version of \"You've got\na friend in me.\"\n\nBullseye acts like a dog in many ways. Unlike most of the other toys, Bullseye\ncannot communicate in clear speech but sounds like an actual horse and uses\nbody language to speak. According to a character interview that used to be on\nthe Toy Story website, Bullseye communicated with Jessie while in storage by\ntapping his hooves to yes or no questions.\n\nBullseye reappears in the short films _[Hawaiian\nVacation](/wiki/Hawaiian_Vacation \"Hawaiian Vacation\")_ , _[Small\nFry](/wiki/Small_Fry_\\(film\\) \"Small Fry \\(film\\)\")_ , and _[Partysaurus\nRex](/wiki/Partysaurus_Rex \"Partysaurus Rex\")._\n\n#### Squeeze Toy Aliens / Little Green\nMen[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Squeeze Toy Aliens / Little Green Men\")]\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [Jeff Pidgeon](/wiki/Jeff_Pidgeon \"Jeff Pidgeon\") (1995–present)\n  * [Debi Derryberry](/wiki/Debi_Derryberry \"Debi Derryberry\") — _Toy Story_\n  * [Patrick Warburton](/wiki/Patrick_Warburton \"Patrick Warburton\") — _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ and _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins_\n\nThe **Squeeze Toy Aliens** , also known as **[Little Green\nMen](/wiki/Little_green_men \"Little green men\")** (or \"**LGMs** \") in the\n_Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ television series, are a series of green,\nthree-eyed [squeaky toy](/wiki/Squeaky_toy \"Squeaky toy\") aliens. They appear\nin all three films, and some were among Andy's toys after the events of _Toy\nStory 2_. Similar to Buzz, they think they're real aliens. Though it is not\ncertain whether they are male or female at first glance, they are identified\nin the third film by Mr. Potato Head as \"[his] boys,\" implying that all three\nare male.\n\nIn _Toy Story_ , Buzz and Woody climb inside a giant rocket-shaped [claw\ngame](/wiki/Claw_crane \"Claw crane\") at Pizza Planet. Inside the claw game are\nhundreds of squeeze toy aliens. When Buzz asks who is in charge, the Little\nGreen Men say \"the claw\", which belongs in the machine; the Little Green Men\nsay that the claw will \"decide who will go and who will stay\". Sid spots Buzz\ninside the claw game and tries to win him. Woody attempts to save Buzz and\nescape through the claw game's maintenance hatch, but the Little Green Men\nstop him and say that they must not fight the claw. Woody, Buzz, and a Little\nGreen Man get taken to Sid's house. Sid gives the Little Green Man to his dog,\nScud, who violently chews it as Woody and Buzz watch in horror. Near the end\nof the movie, the same Little Green Man is seen to be intact, and it helps\nWoody try to scare Sid by getting out of Scud's food bowl and walking like a\nzombie toward Sid.\n\nIn _Toy Story 2_ , a trio of them are hanging above the dashboard in the Pizza\nPlanet truck. Buzz groans when he sees them, remembering them from the claw\ngame in the first film. When the toys are having trouble getting the truck to\nmove, they tell Mr. Potato Head to \"use the wand of power\" (the truck's gear\nlever), which they mistook for the control lever of the giant claw game. They\nnearly fall out of the window, due to the sharp turns from Buzz trying to\ncatch Al in his car. Fortunately, Mr. Potato Head saves them. The Little Green\nMen are thankful and hand him his ear. Throughout the rest of the movie they\nfrequently say \"You have saved our lives, we are eternally grateful,\" much to\nPotato Head's dismay. The Little Green Men join the quest to save Woody and\nmistake the entrance to the baggage area for the \"Mystic Portal\". They chase\nafter the luggage with Rex, Hamm, and Potato Head, only to find cameras. Back\nhome, the trio, along with Bullseye and Jessie, end up becoming some of Andy's\ntoys. They say their gratefulness to Mr. Potato Head, and Mrs. Potato Head is\nso happy that he saved their lives, so she suggests that they adopt them, with\nthe Little Green Men calling Potato Head \"daddy\".\n\nThey reappear in _Toy Story 3_ as the \"henchmen\" under One-Eyed Bart and One-\nEyed Betty, and serve as the getaway drivers during the western opening\nsequence and drive Barbie's corvette. The car is destroyed by Buzz's laser and\nthey are transported to Dr. Porkchop's aircraft. In the present time, the same\ntrio continues to express their gratefulness to Mr. Potato Head. When Andy's\nmother mistakes the trash bag containing them as trash, she puts the toys on\nthe curb, but they manage to escape the garbage bag. They are donated to\nSunnyside along with the rest of Andy's toys. In Sunnyside, the Little Green\nMen find a toy crane, which reminds them of the claw game in Pizza Planet. The\nLittle Green Men get sat on and bounced on during a rough playtime with the\ntoddlers. The toys plan to escape Sunnyside. The Little Green Men have to go\nthrough the playground with Woody and ride on Bullseye. They almost get caught\nby Big Baby because one of the Little Green Men falls off Bullseye and\nsqueaks, but manage to hide inside a pail. Later when Andy's toys escape, one\nof the Little Green Men's feet gets stuck in the lid of the bin at the bottom\nof the chute, possibly after being pulled by Lotso, who had been thrown in the\nbin by Big Baby. Woody goes in to help, but after he helps the Little Green\nMan, Lotso grabs Woody's feet and pulls him into the bin just as the refuse\ntruck arrives. The toys are collected by the truck and subsequently sent to\nlandfill. The Little Green Men are separated from the others by a bulldozer\nwhen they wander off, having spotted a crane. Woody and Mrs. Potato Head yell\nand try to warn them, but they are presumed to be dead after being crushed by\nthe bulldozer. In the end, however, they are revealed to have avoided the\nconveyor belt and later rescue everyone from an incinerator with a giant claw\ncrane for which the Potato Heads finally acknowledges them as his children,\nreciting their repetitive line, \"You have saved our lives and we are eternally\ngrateful.\" The trio are later delivered to Bonnie along with Andy's other\ntoys.\n\nThe Aliens reappear in the theatrical short films _[Hawaiian\nVacation](/wiki/Hawaiian_Vacation \"Hawaiian Vacation\"),_ _[Small\nFry](/wiki/Small_Fry_\\(film\\) \"Small Fry \\(film\\)\")_ and _[Partysaurus\nRex](/wiki/Partysaurus_Rex \"Partysaurus Rex\")._\n\n####\nBarbie[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Barbie\")]\n\nVoiced by [Jodi Benson](/wiki/Jodi_Benson \"Jodi Benson\") — (1999–present)\n\nIn _Toy Story 2_ , when the toys discover [Barbie](/wiki/Barbie \"Barbie\")\ndolls in an aisle while searching for Woody, Tour Guide Barbie volunteers to\nhelp them. During the end credits she is a cinema usherette and is seen giving\nout instructions to the audience. After a while she asks if everyone has gone\nand promptly stops smiling and complains that it hurts her face. She then\nleaves for her break.\n\nIn _Toy Story 3_ , a Barbie appears to be one of the toys that Andy's sister,\nMolly, owns. In Sunnyside, she falls in love with Ken, but after Lotso's\nminions reset Buzz's personality, and reveal that they want to sacrifice\nAndy's old toys in order to protect themselves, she ingratiates herself with\nKen in order to obtain the Buzz Lightyear manual that lets her friends reset\nBuzz to his original form. When she stands up to Lotso by saying that being\ntreated fairly is better than living under his rule, Ken switches his\nallegiance to her and her friends. In the end credits of the film, they get\nback together and change Sunnyside, becoming its co-leaders, after Lotso is\ndefeated.\n\nBarbie appears with Ken in _[Hawaiian Vacation](/wiki/Hawaiian_Vacation\n\"Hawaiian Vacation\")_. They sneak out of the daycare and stowaway in Bonnie's\nbackpack to go to [Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii \"Hawaii\") but Ken is disappointed to\nfind out that Bonnie didn't take her backpack on her family vacation. The gang\ncreates their own Hawaiian paradise to cheer Ken and Barbie up. They share\ntheir first kiss outside and then get trapped in the snow.\n\n#### Sarge and the Bucket O'\nSoldiers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Sarge and the Bucket O' Soldiers\")]\n\nVoiced by [R. Lee Ermey](/wiki/R._Lee_Ermey \"R. Lee Ermey\") (Sarge)\n\n**Sarge** (also known as **Army Sarge** and **Sergeant**) is the gung-ho\ncommander of an army of plastic [toy soldiers](/wiki/Toy_soldier \"Toy\nsoldier\") from _[Bucket O Soldiers](/wiki/Army_men \"Army men\")_ and loosely\nbased on his voice actor's role as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in the 1987 film\n_[Full Metal Jacket](/wiki/Full_Metal_Jacket \"Full Metal Jacket\")._\n\nIn _Toy Story_ , he and the **Bucket O ' Soldiers** are set in particular\npositions. They are highly disciplined with a \"Leave no man behind\" policy and\nare masters of reconnaissance. Woody describes them as \"professionals.\" The\nsoldiers venture out of Andy's room with one of Andy's baby monitors (while\nthe other monitor resides in Andy's room with Woody operating it) and hide in\nan indoor plant to report Andy's birthday presents to the toys and one of his\ncomrades was injured after Mrs. Davis accidentally steps on one of them. They\nannounced the first few presents to the other toys in Andy's room through the\nmonitors, but didn't get to tell them that Andy got a Buzz Lightyear action\nfigure after Rex accidentally breaks the monitor. However, they were able to\nwarn them that Andy and his friends are coming upstairs upon Woody fixing the\nmonitor. Sarge and his soldiers thought Woody was a murderer when he knocked\nBuzz off the window, so they \"frag\" him and each one of them attack Woody,\nalong with the other toys. In the moving van, the soldiers attack Woody when\nhe pushed RC off the van, making Sarge and the toys think he's murdering him\nnow. However, Sarge sees that Woody knocking Buzz out the window was an\naccident, attempts to helps him on the van with the other toys, and is proud\nto work under Woody once again as shown at the end of the film when they hide\nin a Christmas tree and Christmas lights with the baby monitor to report to\nthe toys what Andy and Molly are getting for Christmas.\n\nIn _Toy Story 2,_ the role of Sarge is very minor. He first orders the\nsoldiers to keep looking for Woody's hat in the toy box. When Buster was about\nto come to the room, Sarge and his army held back the door (with help from\nRocky) to prevent Buster's entry, but Buster bursts open the door, causing the\nsoldiers to go flying everywhere. When Woody alerts the toys about the yard\nsale occurring outside the house, he signals Sarge for an \"emergency roll\ncall\" and Sarge orders the toys to line up in a single-file line. At the end,\nSarge and his soldiers watch Wheezy sing \"You've Got a Friend in Me.\"\n\nIn _Toy Story 3,_ several years after _Toy Story 2_ , only Sarge and two\nparatroopers are seen. Woody orders Sarge and his men to retrieve Andy's\ncellphone. That plan, however, fails, and knowing that Andy is going to get\nout the garbage bag, Sarge and his last two men leave Andy's room to find a\nbetter life. Buzz believes they are going [AWOL](/wiki/AWOL \"AWOL\"), but Sarge\nclaims that their mission is complete, and that when trash bags come out, the\nArmy men are always the first to be thrown away (it's likely that the rest of\nthe soldiers had either left prior to that day, or were sold in a yard sale).\nThey appear again at the end of the film where they land in Sunnyside, and\npossibly recognizing Barbie, begin a happy new life under Barbie and Ken's\nleadership.\n\n#### Bo\nPeep[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Bo Peep\")]\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [Annie Potts](/wiki/Annie_Potts \"Annie Potts\") (1995–present)\n  * Rebecca Wink (_Toy Story Racer_)\n\n**[Bo Peep](/wiki/Little_Bo_Peep \"Little Bo Peep\")** is a porcelain figurine\nattached to Molly's bedside lamp inspired by the heroine of the famed nursery\nrhyme; a beautiful, sweet-natured shepherdess accompanied by a single figure\nmerged to resemble three sheep, who serves as Woody's [romantic\ninterest](/wiki/Romantic_interest \"Romantic interest\") of the films. In spite\nof her status as one of Molly's toys, like Mrs. Potato Head she may fall under\nthe category of Andy's toy. In Andy's games of imaginative play she is used as\nthe damsel-in-distress of the stories, and she is depicted as gentle,\nladylike, and kindhearted. In the first film, after Woody's exclusion from the\ngroup when Buzz Lightyear started to attract more attention, she remained\nloyal to him rather than taunting him because of Buzz's rise in popularity.\nAfter Woody accidentally knocked Buzz out the window, she was one of the only\ntoys who did not antagonize him. She continued to show her attraction to Woody\nin _Toy Story 2_ , flirting with him while playing a minor role. However, she\ndid not return in _Toy Story 3_ , except in flashback footage, as, over the\nyears, she had apparently been sold, much to Woody's distress, like a few of\nthe other characters. The particular reason for her disappearance was never\ndisclosed officially, though Woody shows grief over her loss. In August 2015,\nhowever, it was revealed that Bo Peep will have a major role in _Toy Story\n4_.[3] The fourth film will focus on her relationship with Woody, along with\nWoody and Buzz trying to find and bring her back.[4]\n\n####\nRC[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: RC\")]\n\n**RC** is Andy's [remote controlled buggy](/wiki/1:10_radio-controlled_off-\nroad_buggy \"1:10 radio-controlled off-road buggy\"). He has a green body with\nblue splash decals on the front. RC \"speaks\" with revving sounds, although Mr.\nPotato Head and the other toys can understand him regardless. RC is a playable\ncharacter in _Toy Story Racer_.\n\nIn _Toy Story_ , RC was fascinated with Buzz's features. When Woody becomes\nreally jealous, he calls out to Buzz that there is a toy (a magic 8-ball)\ntrapped underneath the desk. Woody sneaks over to RC, starts him up, and tried\nto hit Buzz but misses. However, RC hits a board instead, causing thumbtacks\non the board to fall and a globe to roll. Buzz falls out a window when the\nglobe hits a [red lamp](/wiki/Luxo_Jr. \"Luxo Jr.\") and swings around and hits\nhim. RC says to the other toys that Woody accidentally knocked Buzz out the\nwindow. RC then turns on Woody and thinks that he murdered Buzz. When Woody\nwent to the moving van, he got RC out of the box and pushes him into the\nstreet and controlled him to rescue Buzz during the moving scene at the end of\nthe film.\n\nAfter the toys mistakenly think that Woody is trying to get rid of RC, they\ntoss Woody out of the moving truck into the street. RC finds Buzz hiding under\nthe car in the streets and is thrilled to see him alive and well. Buzz\ncontrolled RC to catch Woody. Woody switched the remote to turbo mode to catch\nup with the truck, but RC's batteries deplete, causing him to slow down and\nfinally stop. When Woody lights the rocket taped onto Buzz's back, Woody and\nBuzz hold onto RC as they rocket toward the truck, but the force of the rocket\nlifts Woody up from RC. Nevertheless, Woody manages to toss RC back into the\ntruck (knocking Mr. Potato Head apart in the process) before he and Buzz go\nskyrocketing into the air.\n\nIn _Toy Story 2_ , RC has a very minor role.

Wheezy was one of Andy's favourite\ntoys until one day his squeaker broke. Andy's mom then put him on the shelf,\nintending to fix his broken squeaker later, but she forgot about him. He is\nabout to be sold at the yard sale, and in saving him, Woody ends up falling so\nthat he is stuck at the yard sale himself and subsequently stolen by Al. At\nthe end of the film, he gets a new \"squeaker\" and sings \"You've Got a Friend\nin Me,\" the ending theme of the movie. During the outtakes, he describes\nhimself as \"not a good catcher\" as he fails to catch Mike's microphone thus\nhurting himself several times.\n\nWheezy does not directly appear in _Toy Story 3_ as he was sold in a yard sale\nafter _Toy Story 2_ , as mentioned by Woody, but he does appear in footage of\nAndy as a boy (Toy Story 3).

He was also seen in the background many times, such\nas during the staff meetings and during Andy's birthday and Christmas gift\nopening scenes. He became fascinated with Buzz during the middle of the film\nwhen he sketched a portrait of him. Angered by this, Woody erased it. He\napparently, like most of the toys, temporarily believes Woody deliberately\nknocked Buzz out of the window; he helps Mr. Potato Head threaten Woody by\nsketching a [hangman's noose](/wiki/Hangman%27s_knot \"Hangman's knot\").\n\nIn _Toy Story 2_ , Etch was seen helping Hamm, Mr. Potato Head and the gang to\nidentify Woody's kidnapper, Al. Later on, when the toys were surfing channels\nto find the location on how to find Al's Toy Barn, Etch is seen in the back as\nhe was ready to draw a map for Buzz. Near the end of the movie, sometime\nbefore Andy comes back from cowboy camp, Etch, as well as the rest of the toys\n(then including Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens), were aligned to welcome\nAndy home, with a \"Welcome Home, Andy\" sign written on Etch.\n\nEtch was sold in yard sale years after the second _Toy Story_ , was mentioned\nby Woody, and only appeared in the archive footage of Andy as a kid in _Toy\nStory 3_.\n\n#### Mr.\nSpell[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Mr. Spell\")]\n\nVoiced by [Jeff Pidgeon](/wiki/Jeff_Pidgeon \"Jeff Pidgeon\")\n\n**Mr. Spell** is based on a popular 1970s [Speak &\nSpell](/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_\\(toy\\) \"Speak & Spell \\(toy\\)\") toy by [Texas\nInstruments](/wiki/Texas_Instruments \"Texas Instruments\").

Then later, when Andy's friends were running up to his room,\nWoody told everyone to go back to their places and the toys began to scatter\nand Mr. Spell can be seen in the overhead shot running in fright and then\nagain behind Mr. Potato Head.\n\nIn _Toy Story 2,_ when Buster finds Woody, Mr. Spell displays 13.5, the amount\nof time in seconds it has elapsed for Buster to find Woody, setting a new\nrecord.

Yet, she is able to play with them. \"[Marie Antoinette](/wiki/Marie_Antoinette \"Marie Antoinette\")\" is probably a nickname (given by Buzz), based on their headlessness rather than the actual name of one of the toys.\n\n#### Mutant\ntoys[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=44\n\"Edit section: Mutant toys\")]\n\nThe **Mutant Toys** are mutilated toys who live their unhappy lives in the\ndarkest corners of Sid's room. They are assembled by Sid from mixed pieces of\nseveral toys that belong to him and Hannah (hence the baby doll's parts). They\ndo not speak, though it is revealed they know Morse Code. Woody and Buzz\ninitially think that they are [cannibals](/wiki/Cannibal \"Cannibal\") who are\ngoing to eat them, before they learn that the toys are actually friendly and\ncompassionate. They fix Buzz's broken arm, Janie and the Pterodactyl, and also\nhelp Woody implement his plan to save Buzz from Sid. They close in on Sid as\nWoody tells Sid how much they hate being mutilated, and they all rejoice in\nvictory after Woody frightens Sid away with his own voice. In _Toy Story\nTreats_ , the Mutant Toys appear in Andy's house.\n\n  * **Baby Face** – The leader of the mutant toys, he is a one-eyed baby doll head staked on top of a [spider](/wiki/Spider \"Spider\")-like body with [crab](/wiki/Crab \"Crab\")-like pincers made of [Erector set](/wiki/Erector_set \"Erector set\") pieces. Baby Face lives in the shadows under Sid's bed. One way Baby Face communicates with the other toys is by banging in [Morse code](/wiki/Morse_code \"Morse code\") on the side of Sid's metal bedpost with his big claw. This method is used when he signals the other mutant toys to gather around to listen to Woody as he formulates his plan to rescue Buzz from Sid. When the mutant toys gain on Sid, Baby Face, suspended by Legs, lands on Sid's head, scaring him. Baby Face is a playable character in the _Toy Story Racer_ video game.\n  * **Legs** – A toy [fishing rod](/wiki/Fishing_rod \"Fishing rod\") with [Barbie](/wiki/Barbie \"Barbie\") doll legs. She is shown to be very strong, being able to hold Ducky's and Baby Face's weight. When Woody formulates his plan to save Buzz from Sid, he assigns Legs to partner up with Ducky. Legs opens the vent grating so she and Ducky can go to the front porch, where Legs lowers Ducky through the hole Ducky created so Ducky can swing toward the doorbell. After Ducky catches the Frog, Legs pulls both toys up to safety. Later, when the mutant toys advance on Sid, Legs lowers Baby Face onto Sid's head, scaring him.\n  * **Hand-in-the-Box** – Hand-in-the-box is based on the character [Thing](/wiki/Thing_\\(The_Addams_Family\\) \"Thing \\(The Addams Family\\)\") from the 1960s TV horror spoof _[The Addams Family](/wiki/The_Addams_Family \"The Addams Family\")_. A green rubber arm that emerges from a black box, it appears to be based on the electro-mechanical coin-bank that was marketed as part of the show's merchandising. During Woody's plan to save Buzz from Sid, Hand-in-the-box, held by Rockmobile mounted on Babyface's head, extends its hand to the doorknob, ready to open the door when the signal comes. After the Frog is let out the room to distract Scud, Hand-in-the-box mounts Roller Bob (held by Rockmobile) and extends its hand to pull Jingle Joe (carrying Janie and the Pterodactyl) when Woody motions the other mutant toys to go down to Sid's backyard. The Hand also grabs Sid's leg when the mutant toys surround him.\n  * **Roller Bob** – A [jet pilot](/wiki/Jet_plane \"Jet plane\") action figure, whose torso has been attached to an old-school mini-[skateboard](/wiki/Skateboard \"Skateboard\"). After the Frog is let out of Sid's room to distract Scud, Roller Bob ferries Woody and the other mutant toys outside the house to Sid's yard.\n  * **The Frog** – The speediest toy of all. A tin wind-up [frog](/wiki/Frog \"Frog\") with two different wheels (left is from an erector set and right is from a [monster truck](/wiki/Monster_truck \"Monster truck\")) instead of back legs. The Frog is missing his left front foot. As part of Woody's plot to rescue Buzz from Sid, Woody orders, \"Wind the Frog!\", and the Walking Car twists the wind-up key on the Frog's back to provide energy. When Ducky rings the doorbell, the Frog is let out of Sid's room, allowing Scud to chase him down the stairs and out to the front porch, where he is caught by Ducky, and Legs reels both toys up to safety.\n  * **Jingle Joe** – The result of a triple toy combination. He is a _Combat Carl_ head staked on top of a Melody Push Chime toddler toy with an arm which is missing from a [Mickey Mouse](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse \"Mickey Mouse\") figure. He appears at the part when he turns Woody's flashlight off by pressing the button. He helps in the plan to save Buzz by supplying motion for Janie and the Pterodactyl when there is no room on Roller Bob.\n  * **Ducky** – Another triple toy combination: a [duck](/wiki/Duck \"Duck\")-headed [Pez](/wiki/Pez \"Pez\") dispenser with a baby doll torso and plunger base. Other than Rockmobile, he is the only one of Sid's toys that can communicate orally. He and Legs go to the front porch via the vent, and Ducky, suspended from the porch ceiling by Legs, swings toward the doorbell until he finally activates it, giving Woody the signal to release the Frog. Ducky catches the Frog as Legs reels both toys up to safety.\n  * **Rockmobile** – A figure with an [insect](/wiki/Insect \"Insect\")'s head who sits in a headless upper torso of _Rocky Gibraltar_ , in which is a steering wheel from a toy car. Rockmobile also walks on the Rocky doll's hands.\n  * **Walking Car** – A yellow 1957 [Austin-Healey 3000](/wiki/Austin-Healey_3000 \"Austin-Healey 3000\") car with small baby doll arms. He can run and climb very quickly. As part of Woody's plot to save Buzz from Sid, when Woody orders to wind the Frog, the Walking Car twists the screw on the Frog's back, giving the Frog enough energy to speed from Sid's room to the porch.\n  * **Janie and Pterodactyl** – Hannah's beloved [rag doll](/wiki/Rag_doll \"Rag doll\"), Janie, and Sid's creepy toy, a small plastic [Pterodactyl](/wiki/Pterodactylus \"Pterodactylus\"), are the subjects of Sid's last \"operation\", called a \"double bypass brain transplant\" (he ripped off their heads and replaced Janie's head with a pterodactyl's). The mutant toys later put their heads on the correct bodies. After the Frog is released from Sid's room for Scud to chase after, Janie and the Pterodactyl ride Jingle Joe (since Roller Bob has run out of capacity) as Woody motions the toys to go down to Sid's back yard. Janie has yellow hair and a striped dress.\n  * **Red[Pickup Truck](/wiki/Pickup_Truck \"Pickup Truck\")** – a toy [Toyota Hilux](/wiki/Toyota_Hilux \"Toyota Hilux\"). It is a broken red pickup truck with crooked parts, missing ear windows and is covered in sand because it was abused and buried in the sandbox. It helps Woody and the other mutant toys rescue Buzz Lightyear from being blown up with a rocket by emerging from the sandbox along with Burned Rag Doll and Walking Car.\n  * **Burned Rag Doll** – a one eyed rag doll that was possibly burnt in an explosion or fire. It repeatedly utters \"Mama!\", which signifies that it talks. It helps Woody and the mutant toys rescue Buzz Lightyear by coming out of the sandbox along with Walking Car and Red Pickup Truck.\n\n### Mason's\ntoys[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=45\n\"Edit section: Mason's toys\")]\n\nAppearing in _Toy Story That Time Forgot_ , these are the toys of Bonnie's\nbest friend Mason.\n\n  * **Battlesaurs** – A group of mostly humanoid dinosaur toys who initially believe themselves to be real beings rather than playthings (like Buzz in the first and third films, and Buzz 2 in the second film). This illusion is encouraged by Mason's greater interest in a new videogame system that he received for Christmas, and they become hostile to Mason's other toys and to Bonnie's when they are brought over for a playdate. However, Trixie is eventually able to convince them that being played with brings its own joy, and they happily embrace their life as toys. \n    * **Reptillus Maximus** (voiced by [Kevin McKidd](/wiki/Kevin_McKidd \"Kevin McKidd\")) – The [Carcharodontosaurus](/wiki/Carcharodontosaurus \"Carcharodontosaurus\")-like Champion of the Battlesaurs, who is fascinated by Trixie after meeting her. Initially, Reptillus is resistant to the idea of being a plaything, feeling that to submit to the will of his child would be surrender and dishonorable. However, Trixie later helps him to see that being there for Mason is honorable, and he helps her divert Mason's attention to his new toys. Near at the end of _Toy Story That Time Forgot_ it's implied that he has a crush on Trixie.\n    * **The Cleric** (voiced by [Steve Purcell](/wiki/Steve_Purcell \"Steve Purcell\")) – An anthropomorphic [Ludodactylus](/wiki/Ludodactylus \"Ludodactylus\") and the \"spiritual\" leader of the Battlesaurs. The Cleric is the first Battlesaur shown to be aware of their status as toys, but conceals it from the others so that he can rule over them and Mason's other toys. However, his plans are thwarted when Reptillus sides with Trixie; he is later shown apparently enjoying his new role as Mason's plaything.\n    * **Ray-Gon** (voiced by [Jonathan Kydd](/wiki/Jonathan_Kydd_\\(actor\\) \"Jonathan Kydd \\(actor\\)\")) – A [Scelidosaurus](/wiki/Scelidosaurus \"Scelidosaurus\") who serves as the armorer of the Battlesaurs, his main contribution is providing Trixie and Rex with battle armor, with the latter featuring remote-control arms that the Cleric uses to manipulate Rex.\n    * **Goliathon** – An [Erythrosuchus](/wiki/Erythrosuchus \"Erythrosuchus\") that is kept as a pet by the other Battlesaurs and used to imprison their enemies in its belly.\n    * **Guards** – Various guards are part of the Battlesaur collections, with raptor-like males and [Parasaurolophus](/wiki/Parasaurolophus \"Parasaurolophus\")-like females amongst others.\n\n## Toy characters by\nlocation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=46\n\"Edit section: Toy characters by location\")]\n\n### Al's Toy Barn and\napartment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=47\n\"Edit section: Al's Toy Barn and apartment\")]\n\nShown in a Buzz Lightyear commercial in _Toy Story_ , this section contains\ncharacters from _Toy Story 2_. Al's Toy Barn appears in _Toy Story 3: The\nVideo Game_.\n\n#### Stinky Pete the\nProspector[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=48\n\"Edit section: Stinky Pete the Prospector\")]\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [Kelsey Grammer](/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer \"Kelsey Grammer\") (_Toy Story 2_)\n  * [Stephen Stanton](/wiki/Stephen_Stanton \"Stephen Stanton\") (_Toy Story 3: The Video Game_)\n\n**Stinky Pete,** also known as **Prospector,** is a\n[prospector](/wiki/Prospecting \"Prospecting\") doll and the primary antagonist\nof _Toy Story 2_. He is a toy modeled after a character on the fictional\ntelevision show, _[Woody's Roundup](/wiki/Woody%27s_Roundup \"Woody's\nRoundup\")_, where the characters consists of [Sheriff\nWoody](/wiki/Sheriff_Woody \"Sheriff Woody\"),\n[Jessie](/wiki/Jessie_\\(Toy_Story\\) \"Jessie \\(Toy Story\\)\"), Stinky Pete, and\nBullseye. The Prospector doll seen in the film had never been opened and was\nstill [\"Mint in the Box\"](/wiki/Mint_condition \"Mint condition\") making him\nsought after by thousands of collectors.\n\nIn contrast to the character on the show, Stinky Pete is quite intelligent,\nmanipulative, and well-spoken and, when he first appears, he seems to be a\ngrandfather figure and mentor. However, he becomes embittered because he has\nnever been sold or played with until Al McWhiggin eventually found him. Stinky\nPete makes no secret of his hatred for space toys like Buzz Lightyear, whom he\nblames for causing the show to be canceled after the launch of\n[Sputnik](/wiki/Sputnik \"Sputnik\"), causing children all over America to lose\ntheir interest in cowboy toys, shifting their interest to space adventures\ninstead.\n\nYears after being purchased, Stinky Pete would spend years in storage while Al\nbought more toys and advertisements from _Woody 's Roundup._ After Al had\nstolen Woody, Stinky Pete and Jessie were excited because now they could go to\nthe Konishi Toy Museum in Japan, where they will be treated with respect.\nWoody reveals that he has an owner named Andy Davis, which infuriates Jessie\nand leads the Prospector to become determined to make sure Woody doesn't go\nback to Andy at any cost, despite the fact that he is now aware that Al\nactually has stolen Woody because he still belongs to Andy.\n\nWhen Al accidentally rips off Woody's arm, Stinky Pete secretly leaves his box\nand he sabotages Woody's attempt to recover his arm and return to Andy by\nturning on the TV. He then frames Jessie for this by putting the TV remote\nnear her before returning to his box and pretending that he \"doesn't know\" how\nthe TV turned on after Woody falls for his trick. He later convinces Woody to\nwait until his arm is supposed to be fixed in the morning, which is done after\nAl calls in a cleaner. After Woody's arm is fixed, Stinky Pete convinces Woody\nafter a story that Jessie tells him about her old owner, that Andy won't play\nwith him anymore by the time he goes to college, but in Japan, Woody will be\ntreasured forever. Woody agrees to stay with them instead of going back to\nAndy, much to Stinky Pete, Jessie and Bullseye's delight.\n\nHowever, Woody's friends arrive during a celebration of going to Japan and\nthey demand that Woody returns to Andy, but Woody angrily refuses, resulting\nin the toys sadly saying goodbye and leaving without him. However, before\nleaving, Buzz says an upset goodbye to Woody by saying that he'll be staying\nbehind glass forever and not being loved again if he chooses to go to Japan,\nleaving Woody to think over his choice. However, Woody has a change of heart\nand tells Buzz that he is coming with them, and invites his friends to come\nwith him to Andy's house. However, Stinky Pete is very angry with Woody for\nattempting to leave with Jessie and Bullseye back to Andy's house, and once\nagain he sabotages Woody's attempt to escape by tightening the bolt to the\nvent (as well as revealing to the others that he can actually get out of his\nbox whenever he wants) and uses his pick axe to turn off the TV, causing Woody\nto realize that it was the Prospector who foiled his escape the previous night\nby turning on the TV and framing Jessie for it. He sees unpopular toys like\nhim and the Roundup Gang doomed to either always ending up in storage or\n\"spending a lifetime on a dime store shelf watching every other toy be sold,\"\nsimilar to his fate before Al found him, and does not want Woody, Jessie, and\nBullseye to suffer the same fate. He also sees children as destroyers of toys\nwhose ultimate fate will be \"spending eternity rotting in some\n[landfill](/wiki/Landfill \"Landfill\")\". This makes him all the more determined\nto go to the Tokyo museum and become an exhibit for the rest of his life,\nunlike Woody and Jessie. When Slinky attempts to get Woody out of Al's\nsuitcase, Stinky Pete quickly stops them and yanks Woody back in.\n\nWhen an angry Stinky Pete punches Buzz off the ramp at the airport to prevent\nWoody's rescue, Woody confronts and fights Stinky Pete for harming his friend.\nStinky Pete manages to overpower him, ripping his right arm in the process. He\nthen attempts to finish Woody off after he refuses to get back in the case as\ntold, assuring him that he will be fixed again in Japan while saying that\ngoing home will eventually end up with him being in pieces. The other toys\nblind and stun Stinky Pete with flash cameras that the toys found after they\nconfused and mistook another green luggage case for Woody's. Buzz, surviving\nthe fall, captures Stinky Pete and Woody instructs Buzz and the other toys to\ndump Stinky Pete into a Barbie doll backpack that belongs to a little girl\nnamed Amy (voiced by [Debi Derryberry](/wiki/Debi_Derryberry \"Debi\nDerryberry\")), who enjoys decorating her dolls' faces with tattoos, as\npunishment and revenge for his betrayal, knowing it will make him learn the\ntrue meaning of playtime. Upon learning of Amy's occupations of decorating her\ndolls, Stinky Pete starts to weep as he is taken to his new owner's home.\nIronically, this fate is a rectification of a past injustice done to Stinky\nPete. Since much of his anger came from never being sold, opened or played\nwith; now he is finally being owned by a child after waiting 50 years.\n\nHowever, after the film's release, the film's website featured interviews with\nthe characters. In Stinky Pete's interview, he has reformed and said that he\nhas become accustomed to Amy decorating him, as well of being fond of Amy\nherself.\n\nDespite his appearance, Stinky Pete does not appear in the third film, because\nhe was no longer mentioned, though he seems to accurately predict the events\nof _Toy Story 3_ (as what he had said after his defeat started to come true in\nthe film). He asks Woody if Andy will take him to college, and later tells the\nrest of the toys that children destroy toys, which occurs in the Sunnyside\nDaycare, and that they will be forgotten and end up in a landfill permanently,\nwhere the toys are narrowly rescued from the incinerator after an escape\nattempt and return to Andy's. The last part of his prediction did not come\ntrue.\n\nAccording to his box, Stinky Pete had a total of 9 sayings. In one outtake,\nStinky Pete is seen talking to two Barbie dolls in the box, promising them a\nrole in the third film. In another outtake, Stinky Pete gives Woody a choice\nto go back to Andy's home or stay, until he suffers a bout of flatulence,\nwhich he later implies is the reason for his nickname.\n\nDespite the fact that he does not appear in the third film, Stinky Pete does\nappear in the Toy Box Mode of _Toy Story 3: The Video Game._\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary, the Pixar team had deliberated for a while\nwhat the proper comeuppance for the Prospector would be before it was decided\nfor him to be placed in a Barbie bag with a face-painted Barbie.\n\n#### Utility Belt Buzz\nLightyear[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=49\n\"Edit section: Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear\")]\n\nVoiced by [Tim Allen](/wiki/Tim_Allen \"Tim Allen\")\n\nWhen searching for Woody at Al's Toy Barn, Buzz comes across the Buzz\nLightyear aisle, causing him to stare in awe. While looking around, Buzz\nnotices that there is a display case labeled \"New Utility Belt.\" Buzz then\nclimbs up the display case to find a newer Buzz Lightyear with a Utility Belt.\nWhen Buzz tries to take the belt, the newer Buzz (who thinks he is a real\nSpace Ranger, similar to Andy's Buzz in the [original film](/wiki/Toy_Story\n\"Toy Story\")) springs to life and grabs him, believing him to be an AWOL Space\nRanger. Buzz finds himself wondering out loud if he was this deluded, which\nUtility Belt Buzz mistakes for talking back and threatens to use his laser on\nhim. Buzz tries to prove to him that he is not an actual Space Ranger by\nshowing him that his laser is actually a light bulb. This doesn't work however\nand Utility Belt Buzz jumps out of the way and tells him that he could've\nkilled him. Buzz then decides that he's had enough and tries to leave, only\nfor Utility Belt Buzz to jump out and attack him. After trapping Buzz in a box\nsimilar to the one he came in, he is mistaken for the original Buzz by the\ngang. When Rex mentions that he knows how to defeat Emperor Zurg—having\nrecently acquired a walkthrough guide for the _Buzz Lightyear_ video game that\nhe's been stuck on, Utility Belt Buzz quickly decides to tag along thinking\nthat the toys are trying to find Zurg. While the gang search Al's Toy Barn and\nthrough the vents of Al's apartment with Utility Belt Buzz, they become\nincreasingly suspicious of his cocky attitude (\"I'm Buzz Lightyear! I'm always\nsure!\") and strange actions (such as thinking that he is flying up the\nelevator shift and is unaware that he's standing on the elevator, which is\nhelping him fly) until they are finally reunited with Andy's Buzz, who defuses\nhis counterpart's confusion by claiming that the situation is a 'Code 546'\n(Precisely what this involves is unknown, but it prompted Utility Belt Buzz to\nrefer to Woody as \"Your Majesty\").\n\nHeading to the elevator on the way down, they encounter a savage Emperor Zurg\ntoy and Utility Belt Buzz engages him in battle. When Utility Belt Buzz claims\nZurg killed his father, Zurg responds he _is_ his father, causing Utility Belt\nBuzz to scream in dismay (a parody of _[The Empire Strikes\nBack](/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back \"The Empire Strikes Back\")_). Rex defeats\nZurg by accident, sending him falling off the elevator to his apparent doom by\nknocking him off-balance with his tail when he turns away as Zurg prepares to\nshoot Utility Belt Buzz, upsetting him. He is last seen playing catch with his\n\"father,\" the Zurg toy, whose attitude towards Utility Belt Buzz has changed\nafter the fall.\n\n#### Evil Emperor\nZurg[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=50\n\"Edit section: Evil Emperor Zurg\")]\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [Andrew Stanton](/wiki/Andrew_Stanton \"Andrew Stanton\") (1999–present)\n  * [Wayne Knight](/wiki/Wayne_Knight \"Wayne Knight\") (_Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ and _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins_)\n  * [Jess Harnell](/wiki/Jess_Harnell \"Jess Harnell\") (mini counterpart)\n  * [James Patrick Stuart](/wiki/James_Patrick_Stuart \"James Patrick Stuart\") (_Disney Magic Kingdoms_)[7]\n\n**Evil Emperor Zurg** is a space villain action figure and Buzz Lightyear's\n[archenemy](/wiki/Archenemy \"Archenemy\"). He has red evil eyes with neon\ngritting teeth, silver horns on his head, a purple tunic with a black cape on\nit and his weapon, a gun (which has a power control that, as a homage to\n_[This is Spinal Tap](/wiki/This_is_Spinal_Tap \"This is Spinal Tap\")_ , goes\nto 11). In some cases, he does not have a gun but a hand like the one on his\nother arm.\n\nIn the first film, Zurg is a referenced character, and does not appear at all.\nHowever, Zurg is first seen in the opening sequence of the second film when\nBuzz is trying to take his main power away from him (Zurg's main power is from\nan [AA battery](/wiki/AA_battery \"AA battery\") which is actually revealed to\nbe a hologram). In the ensuing battle, Zurg vaporizes the top half of Buzz\nLightyear's body with his gun, killing him. The sequence then cuts showing\nthat the opening sequence was actually a video game played by\n[Rex](/wiki/Rex_\\(Toy_Story\\) \"Rex \\(Toy Story\\)\").\n\nAs the story progresses, a Zurg toy in Al's Toy Barn bursts out from its box\nand follows Andy's Buzz Lightyear, who is on the way to rescue\n[Woody](/wiki/Sheriff_Woody \"Sheriff Woody\") from [Al\nMcWhiggin](/wiki/List_of_Toy_Story_characters#Al_McWhiggin \"List of Toy Story\ncharacters\"). Zurg is deluded, similar to Andy's Buzz in the first film. In\nthe second film, [another copy of Buzz\nLightyear](/wiki/List_of_Toy_Story_characters#Utility_Belt_Buzz \"List of Toy\nStory characters\"), deluded in the same way as Andy's Buzz in the first film,\nescapes from Al's Toy Barn and battles with Zurg on top of an elevator. In a\nreference to the relationship of [Luke Skywalker](/wiki/Luke_Skywalker \"Luke\nSkywalker\") and [Darth Vader](/wiki/Darth_Vader \"Darth Vader\"), the principal\nhero and villain respectively of the original _[Star Wars](/wiki/Star_Wars\n\"Star Wars\")_ trilogy, Evil Emperor Zurg claims he is in fact the father of\nBuzz, in an almost word-for-word parody of the scene in _[The Empire Strikes\nBack](/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back \"The Empire Strikes Back\")_. As Zurg\nattempts to finish off Buzz at point-blank range,\n[Rex](/wiki/List_of_Toy_Story_characters#Rex \"List of Toy Story characters\")\naccidentally hits Zurg with his large tail and sends him falling down the\nelevator shaft. The second Buzz looks down the shaft in despair, thinking he\nhas lost his father, while Rex is excited that he has finally managed to\ndefeat Zurg in real life. Near the end of the film, Zurg is seen to have\nsurvived his fall with a bent horn and is now playing catch with the second\nBuzz. He supposedly bumped his head so hard that he forgot he was Buzz\nLightyear's worst enemy. In the novelisation, however, Zurg is killed by the\nfall, and Buzz finds him and takes him back to Al's Toy Barn to bury him.\n\nZurg is mentioned in the third film by Buzz in his bad guy character after\nLotso resets him to Demo mode. Zurg appears briefly during a sequence in the\nend credits, where he is donated to Sunnyside Daycare center and greeted by\nthe resident toys.\n\nZurg also appears as in _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ and its direct-to-\nvideo movie _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins_. Zurg says\nhe is Lightyear's father during a fight in order to shock Lightyear, before\nregaining the advantage during the fight and then denying the truth of that\nprevious claim. Whether or not this is actually true, Buzz definitely does not\nknow who his father is. This version of Zurg is also severely lightened up,\ngoing from the movie's Darth Vader-esque version to a far less intimidating\none; in the TV series Zurg is a flamboyant villain who is just as much a comic\nrelief character as he is a formidable opponent, similar to\n[Skeletor](/wiki/Skeletor \"Skeletor\"). This Zurg is known for videotaping\nBuzz's speeches, maintaining a troll doll collection, and various other\ncomedic habits. He is shown to have a bit of a British accent throughout the\nseries. It is revealed in the first episode that there is a Nana Zurg, but she\nis never seen at all (although he claims that she's \"plenty evil\"). Zurg would\nappear to be a cyborg of some description, also much like [Darth\nVader](/wiki/Darth_Vader \"Darth Vader\"). However, it has also been discussed\namongst fans that his \"cybernetic\" traits could also very well be because of\nadvanced technology. There is yet to be a clear answer. In the TV series, he\nis the warlord-like ruler of an evil empire and is in command of an army of\nHornet robots, as well of a minion workforce consisting of Grubs and\nBrainpods. The seat of which is the hellish Planet Z (standing for Xrghthung).\nIn various media surrounding the film, his planet is said to be called\nXrghthung. However, because this is unpronounceable in the TV series it is\nchanged to simply \"Z.\" It is unknown whether Zurg rules over any other worlds,\nbut, if he does, they have not been revealed. Planet Z evidently possesses\nvast resources and forces enabling Zurg to be a serious threat to the Galactic\nAlliance. Despite being frequently gullible and bungling, Zurg is evidently\nhighly intelligent, able to concoct sound military tactics and\n[Machiavellian](/wiki/Machiavelli \"Machiavelli\") evil schemes. Additionally,\nhe occasionally references stereotypes of typical evil villains and\nintentionally violates them, showing how aware he is of his similarity to\nthem. For example, when designing a vast prison on Planet Z, he declines\nbuilding an execution arena, for it simply \"gives the captives more time to\nget away.\" When he was designing a schematic for a new base, he expressly\nforbade for air vents that allow \"hero-sized objects\" into the control room.\n\"And, may I remind you, no giant trash compactor! When heroes fall in, they\nalways have enough time to figure a way out. Make it—an incinerator!\"\n\nDespite his camp nature, he is just as fearsome and ruthless as his movie\ncounterpart. Zurg is frequently mentioned to be the most evil villain in the\ngalaxy and appears to possess authority over all other villains. In fact, he\nwould appear to be a physical manifestation of pure evil. He is particularly\nproud of this and frequently brags of how \"evil\" he is.

All appear in _Toy Story 3_\nonly.\n\n#### Lots-O'-Huggin'\nBear[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=53\n\"Edit section: Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear\")]\n\nVoiced by [Ned Beatty](/wiki/Ned_Beatty \"Ned Beatty\")\n\n**Lots-O '-Huggin' Bear** (**Lotso** for short) is a plush, hot pink [teddy\nbear](/wiki/Teddy_bear \"Teddy bear\") with a big plum nose, a sweet strawberry\nscent and a [southern accent](/wiki/Southern_American_English \"Southern\nAmerican English\"), who uses a wooden toy [mallet](/wiki/Mallet \"Mallet\") as\nan [assistive cane](/wiki/Assistive_cane \"Assistive cane\") (although he is\nstill able to walk even without it). He is the self-proclaimed leader of the\ntoys at the Sunnyside Daycare Center. He initially acts like a kind-hearted\nand wise caretaker, but is eventually revealed to be a ruthless [prison\nwarden](/wiki/Prison_warden \"Prison warden\"), although his\n[backstory](/wiki/Backstory \"Backstory\") makes him more of a tragic villain.\n\nIn _Toy Story 3_ , he welcomes Andy's toys to Sunnyside and assigns them to\nthe Caterpillar Room. Woody tries to escape from Sunnyside so he could go back\nto Andy, but is instead found and taken by a little girl named Bonnie. Woody\nlearns from Chuckles, one of Bonnie's toys, that Lotso was once owned and\nloved by a girl named Daisy, having become Daisy's favorite toy when she\nobtained it for [Christmas](/wiki/Christmas \"Christmas\"). Lotso became friends\nwith Chuckles and Big Baby. One day, Daisy and her family had a picnic in the\ncountryside. When she fell asleep, her parents drove her home, inadvertently\nleaving the toys behind. Not wanting to give up, Lotso led his two friends on\na long trek back to Daisy's house, only to discover that Daisy had gotten\nanother Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear. Lotso became embittered and convinced Big Baby\nthat they had been replaced, leaving Daisy's home with Chuckles. Lotso\neventually discovered Sunnyside Daycare Center and turned it into an\n[internment camp](/wiki/Internment_camp \"Internment camp\") for toys. Big Baby\ntook on the role of Lotso's enforcer, while Chuckles was broken, and was\ndiscovered by Bonnie and taken home.\n\nMeanwhile, Lotso realizes that Buzz is actually requesting a transfer of\nhimself and the rest of Andy's toys to the Butterfly Room. Thinking of Buzz to\nbe useful to him, Lotso only approves the transfer to him. When Buzz refuses\nLotso's offer to stay in the Caterpillar Room, Lotso reverses Buzz to demo\nmode and manipulates him into imprisoning Andy's other toys.\n\nWhen Woody and Andy's toys attempt to flee from the daycare center. Lotso\ncatches the group and once again offers them to stay at Sunnyside when a\ngarbage truck arrives, but the toys refuse and Lotso instructs Stretch to push\nthe toys into the dumpster. Woody argues with Lotso over his wrongdoings and\nreveals to him what he knows about Daisy and tosses Daisy's ownership tag to\nhim; Lotso destroys it and says that toys are supposed to be discarded. His\nhenchmen then turn on him and Big Baby throws him into the dumpster. As the\ntoys attempt to flee, a vengeful Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as\nthe truck collects it to get the other toys to be sent to the dump.\n\nAt the landfill, the toys end up on a conveyor belt leading to a shredder.\nFinding Lotso stuck under a large golf bag, Woody and Buzz rescue him and\nescape the shredder, only to realize that it leads to an\n[incinerator](/wiki/Incineration \"Incineration\"). As they are about to reach\nthe incinerator, Lotso sees an emergency stop button, and with Woody and\nBuzz's help, manages to reach it. However, instead of pushing the button, he\nchooses to leave them behind, as he is still evil and selfish on the inside\nand still believes that all toys are meant to be at the dump. When Woody and\nthe toys are rescued by the aliens, Hamm and Slinky want to get back at Lotso\nfor leaving them to die, but Woody talks them out of it, claiming that \"he's\nnot worth it\" and that the dump is the right place for him. Lotso (who is\nunaware the Andy's toys are still alive) is eventually found by a garbage man\nwho recalls that he once had a Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear as a child, and straps\nLotso to the grill of a garbage truck with three other toys before driving\naway.\n\nLotso was intended to be in the first film (originally for a sequel to [Tin\nToy](/wiki/Tin_Toy \"Tin Toy\")), but the technology to design the fur to the\nproper consistency had yet to exist until _[Monsters,\nInc.](/wiki/Monsters,_Inc. \"Monsters, Inc.\")_ in 2001, so he was saved for the\nthird film. However, an early version of Lotso can be seen in the first film\nwhen Woody says \"Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf, can you hear me? Great!\"\nand can be seen in the second film during the first Al's Toy Barn Commercial.\n\nTest audiences who had sympathized with Lotso for his backstory had wanted him\nto push the button in the incinerator scene to redeem himself. However,\naccording to the DVD commentary, director Lee Unkrich explained that Lotso not\npushing the button to save the toys was intended for the audience to really\ncare about the characters after three films of getting to know them when it\nlooked like it was the end for them in the incinerator. The Pixar team took\nnote of the people's concerns and made Lotso to be an outright, selfish liar.\n\nLotso also makes a cameo appearance in Pixar's 2009 movie\n_[Up](/wiki/Up_\\(2009_film\\) \"Up \\(2009 film\\)\")_ in a little girl's room in\nthe city where Mr. Fredricksen's house goes by in the bottom left corner in\nthe shadow of the bed.\n\nNed Beatty was nominated for an [MTV Movie Award for Best\nVillain](/wiki/MTV_Movie_Award_for_Best_Villain \"MTV Movie Award for Best\nVillain\") for his performance as Lotso, and Pixar and he received widespread\npraise for the character's back story and Beatty's performance.\n[IGN](/wiki/IGN \"IGN\") named Lotso the best villain of the summer of 2010.[8]\n\n####\nKen[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=54\n\"Edit section: Ken\")]\n\nVoiced by [Michael Keaton](/wiki/Michael_Keaton \"Michael Keaton\")\n\n**[Ken](/wiki/Ken_\\(doll\\) \"Ken \\(doll\\)\")** is a smooth-talking doll who\nfalls in love with Barbie. He first appears wearing light blue pleated and\ncuffed shorts, and a tucked-in leopard-print shirt with short sleeves. His\naccessories include matching ascot, sensible loafers and a fashion-forward\ngold belt. He lives in Ken's Dreamhouse, a big yellow doll house with three\nstories, a large wardrobe room, and an elevator. Barbie originally breaks up\nwith Ken when she finds him, Lotso, his other henchmen, and a reset Buzz\nLightyear locking up her friends and discovering their ulterior motive.\nPiqued, Ken orders her locked up as well.\n\nHowever, as part of a plan to escape, she pretends to forgive Ken, gaining\naccess to his dream house. Barbie then ties Ken hostage to try to get him to\nreveal how to reset Buzz back to normal. As a provocation, she entangles him\nin an ironing board and rips his clothing apart. Ken reveals the truth after\nshe begins to sabotage his prized [Nehru jacket](/wiki/Nehru_jacket \"Nehru\njacket\"). He is not seen again until Lotso has the toys cornered at the\ndumpster, where he is the first to turn on Lotso. Ken comes to Barbie's help\nby trying to stop Lotso, having realized Barbie through her understanding of\ncivics. Lotso tells Ken \"there's 100,000,000 just like her\", but Ken insists\nthat for him, there is no one else like her, and wins back her affections.\n\nIn the end credits of the film, he and Barbie are seen greeting new toys at\nSunnyside as Barbie becomes his girlfriend again, and with Lotso gone, they\nboth take charge of the Sunnyside toys as the new leaders. He resembles a real\ndoll from 1988 called Animal Lovin' Ken.[9] Due to being called a \"girl's\ntoy,\" it is often joked about his femininity: such as his large selection and\nobsession with clothes, him wearing Barbie's scarf, his rather feminine boxer-\nshorts, Bookworm not being suspicious seeing who he believed being Ken (Barbie\nin a spacesuit outfit) in [high heels](/wiki/High_heels \"High heels\"), as well\nas at the end Buzz believing Barbie wrote them the fancy note, only to\ndiscover Ken's signature at the end.\n\nKen, along with Barbie, appears in the theatrical short, _Hawaiian Vacation_ ,\nin which the two embark on a journey to Hawaii, but ends up in Bonnie's room,\nwhere Woody and the other toys reenact various Hawaiian scenes.\n\n#### Big\nBaby[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=55\n\"Edit section: Big Baby\")]\n\nVoiced by Woody Smith (2010–present)\n\n**Big Baby** is a [Bitty Baby](/wiki/Bitty_Baby \"Bitty Baby\") doll with a\n[lazy eye](/wiki/Strabismus \"Strabismus\") who carries around a bottle and is\nadorned with childlike scribbling that resembles ferocious\n[tattoos](/wiki/Tattoos \"Tattoos\"). He normally does not speak, instead\ncommunicating through baby sounds, with the exception of one spoken line after\nthe toys escape Sunnyside. Big Baby was once one of Daisy's toys before he,\nLotso, and Chuckles were lost at a rest area. After returning home, Lotso lied\nto Big Baby, claiming that Daisy replaced and no longer loved them. They\neventually took over Sunnyside Daycare, where Big Baby became Lotso's third-\nin-command. Eventually, Woody reveals to Lotso that Daisy still cared about\nthem and gives Big Baby his pendant, sparking his memory of his former owner,\nwhom he called \"Mama\". Lotso derides Big Baby for his attachment to Daisy and\nsmashes the pendant with his mallet. Big Baby turns against Lotso and throws\nhim in the dumpster (a parody of a scene from [Return of the\nJedi](/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi \"Return of the Jedi\")), [blows him a\nraspberry](/wiki/Blowing_a_raspberry \"Blowing a raspberry\"), and helps Woody\nand his friends escape Sunnyside.\n\nIn the credits, Big Baby is much happier at Sunnyside under Barbie and Ken's\ncare, and even wears gold diapers to match their outfits at a party at the\ndaycare.\n\nThe baby who provided the voice for Big Baby is named \"Woody,\" according to\n[Lee Unkrich](/wiki/Lee_Unkrich \"Lee Unkrich\")'s Twitter account,[10] and the\nfilm's credits confirm it as being Woody Smith (listed under Additional\nvoices).\n\n####\nTwitch[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=56\n\"Edit section: Twitch\")]\n\nVoiced by [John Cygan](/wiki/John_Cygan \"John Cygan\")\n\n**Twitch** is a green \"insectaloid warrior\" action figure with a bug's head,\norange eyes with ferocious chomping mandibles, wings, and two muscular arms.\nHe is one of the toy thugs working for Lotso.

During the credits, he is\nseen living in a happier Sunnyside and is shown taking a turn to endure\nplaytime with the young children in the Caterpillar Room, switching with Chunk\nso he can rest.\n\nTwitch is reminiscent of the 1980s \"[He-Man](/wiki/He-Man \"He-Man\") and the\n[Masters of the Universe](/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe \"Masters of the\nUniverse\")\" toy line, and other similar lines.\n\n####\nStretch[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=57\n\"Edit section: Stretch\")]\n\nVoiced by [Whoopi Goldberg](/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg \"Whoopi Goldberg\")\n\n**Stretch** is a toy rubber [octopus](/wiki/Octopus \"Octopus\") with sticky\nsuckers on her eight long arms and a glittery, purple body.

With her cohorts, she later catches\nWoody and his friends, and was eager to push them into the dumpster, should\nthey not admit defeat. However, Stretch was also seen to be the first toy to\ndoubt Lotso's leadership and motives, as she was seen to visibly cringe at\nLotso's true character being revealed. After Lotso destroys Big Baby's locket,\nhe angrily orders Stretch to push Woody and his friends into the dumpster,\nwhich Stretch is now reluctant to do, causing Lotso to reveal his true\nfeelings about all toys. Eventually, Lotso is thrown into the dumpster by Big\nBaby for his lies and treachery, and Stretch immediately leaves the area,\nshocked at what had happened but relieved. In the credits, she welcomes new\ntoys happily without Lotso and is later seen sneaking a message to Woody and\nthe gang in Bonnie's backpack.

He sports telescoping arms with\nworking pincers and he can also elevate his body to make himself taller. He\nstarts out as one of Lotso's henchmen, but in the dumpster scene, when Ken\nstates that Lotso put all of the toys in Sunnyside Daycare into a pyramid and\nplaced himself on the top, he and Twitch (and likely Chunk as well) start to\ndoubt Lotso's leadership as both of them look at each other. Both of them are\nalso in shock when Lotso shows his true colors and pokes Big Baby angrily in\nthe stomach. They also witness Big Baby who retaliates by throwing Lotso into\nthe dumpster, and he and the rest of his fellow henchmen let Andy's toys\nescape. In the end, he and the rest of Lotso's former henchmen reform for the\nbetter and become nicer.\n\nSparks has only one line, when he points out Chunk's low intelligence, he\nsays, \"Neither are you, Chunk\" after Chunk gives his opinion on Buzz.\n\n#### Chatter\nTelephone[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=60\n\"Edit section: Chatter Telephone\")]\n\nVoiced by [Teddy Newton](/wiki/Teddy_Newton \"Teddy Newton\")\n\n**[Chatter Telephone](/wiki/Chatter_Telephone \"Chatter Telephone\")** is a\ncharacter based on the real-life toy of the same name.

When Woody\nreturns to Sunnyside, he immediately says that coming back was a mistake\nbecause Lotso had rigged his security after he left and that the best action\nwould be to just lay low. He reluctantly gives him instructions on how to\nescape Sunnyside. For this, he is later brutally beaten and broken for helping\nWoody and his group escape, and eventually rats Woody out when convinced that\nWoody and the other toys had already escaped, but are caught just before they\ncan do so. He sadly apologizes to Woody who fortunately shows sympathy for the\nbroken toy.

Kids do not like Pizza-Bot for some reason which makes him sad.\n\n#### Sleep Well\nToys[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=65\n\"Edit section: Sleep Well Toys\")]\n\nA set of toys who were stolen from their owners during their stay at the Sleep\nWell roadside motel by Manager Ron's pet iguana, Mr. Jones, so that Ron could\nsell them online. They appear in _Toy Story of Terror!_ , where they are held\nalong with Bonnie's toys while Ron auctions them off on the Internet. They\neventually escape with help from Jessie, and depart the Sleep Well on a mail\ntruck.\n\n  * **Combat Carl** (voiced by [Carl Weathers](/wiki/Carl_Weathers \"Carl Weathers\")) – A [G.I. Joe](/wiki/G.I._Joe \"G.I. Joe\")-esque action figure. He is African-American in appearance, unlike the Caucasian [character of the same name](/wiki/List_of_Toy_Story_characters#Combat_Carl \"List of Toy Story characters\") who briefly appeared in the first film. He is encountered by Jessie after all of her friends have been captured, having eluded Mr. Jones though losing a hand in the process. Carl is extremely paranoid and refers to himself in the third person, but later helps Jessie overcome her fears to save everyone. He was owned by a boy named Billy, to whom he is determined to return.\n  * **Combat Carl Jr.** (voiced by Carl Weathers in a high-pitched voice) – A miniature version of Combat Carl who has a close relationship with his larger self.\n  * **Pocketeer** (voiced by [Ken Marino](/wiki/Ken_Marino \"Ken Marino\")) – Part of an action figure line known as the \"Fastener Four,\" the Pocketeer has an outfit covered in pockets in which he keeps various helpful items. His fellows Zipper Man, Snaps, and Speed Lacer were sold by Ron prior to the capture of Bonnie's toys.\n  * **Pez Cat** (voiced by [Kate McKinnon](/wiki/Kate_McKinnon \"Kate McKinnon\")) – a [Pez dispenser](/wiki/Pez_dispenser \"Pez dispenser\") whose head is that of a cat wearing glasses, and who serves as the lookout for the trapped toys in the Sleep Well motel.\n  * **Transitron** (voiced by [Peter Sohn](/wiki/Peter_Sohn \"Peter Sohn\")) – a [Transformers](/wiki/Transformers \"Transformers\")-esque transforming robot who splits into five vehicle components. Jessie freed Transitron from a box he was to be shipped in and then had him seal her inside so she could rescue Woody; Transitron later joined up with the other stolen toys and departed the Sleep Well.\n\n## Non-toy\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=66\n\"Edit section: Non-toy characters\")]\n\n###\nHumans[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=67\n\"Edit section: Humans\")]\n\n#### Andy\nDavis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=68\n\"Edit section: Andy Davis\")]\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * [John Morris](/wiki/John_Morris_\\(actor\\) \"John Morris \\(actor\\)\") — _Toy Story_ , _Toy Story 2_ , _Toy Story 3_\n  * Charlie Bright — _Toy Story 3_ (young)\n\n**Andrew \"Andy\" Davis Jr.**[11] is the owner of Woody, Buzz and the other toys\nin each of the three films. He lived with his mother and sister Molly, but\nleft to go to [college](/wiki/College \"College\") when he was 17. However, his\nfather is never seen or mentioned in the films. _Toy Story 2_ implies that\nWoody might be a hand-me-down toy, and when introducing the 2009 set of Toy\nStory collectibles, John Lasseter said \"We always imagined he was a hand-me-\ndown to Andy from his father.\"\n\nIn _Toy Story_ , Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his 6th\nbirthday party. Tension erupts between Buzz and Woody, who has always prided\nhimself on being Andy's favorite. Andy initially spends much more time with\nhis new toy, but still has a special place in his heart for Woody. Thus, he\nbecomes concerned when both toys go missing for a time, fearing they would be\nlost during his family's move to a new house.\n\nIn _Toy Story 2_ , Andy is only seen in the beginning and for a short while in\nthe ending. During his appearances, it is clear that he still loves his toys\nvery much. At the end of the film, Andy is pleased to have five new toys –\nJessie, Bullseye, and the three Squeeze Toy Aliens – added into his\ncollection. He marks them, as he has all his toys, with his name on the soles\nof their feet, or in Bullseye's case, one letter of his name on each hoof.\n\nIn _Toy Story 3_ , Andy is 17 and preparing to go off to college, intending to\nput most of his toys in the attic except for Woody, whom he initially plans to\ntake with him. While he apparently has not played with his toys for some years\nand has given many of them away, he is still resistant to his mother's\nsuggestion to either donate or sell his remaining toys, referring to them as\n\"junk\" (which the toys believe is what he truly thinks). When they go missing,\nhowever, he becomes upset and confused when he cannot find them. Before he\ngoes to college, Woody secretly puts the address of Bonnie (the young daughter\nof a family friend) on the box with the toys in it, causing Andy to come\naround to the idea of donating them. He passes them on to young Bonnie, who he\nrealizes will look after his childhood playthings and gives them each their\nown introduction, stating the qualities that make each of them special. When\nBonnie finds Woody in the box as well, Andy shows great reluctance to pass on\nhis favorite toy, but ultimately relents, allowing the toys to stay together\nin an environment where they will be loved and played with. He spends time\nwith Bonnie and the toys one last time before departing for college, and is\nnoticeably sad when Bonnie has Woody \"wave\" to him. He then responds with a\nquiet \"Thanks, guys\".\n\nAccording to _Toy Story_ producer Ralph Guggenheim in a December 1995\nAnimation Magazine article, John Lasseter and the story team for _Toy Story_\nreviewed the names of Pixar employees' children, looking for the right name\nfor Woody's owner. Davis was ultimately named after and based on [Andy\nLuckey](/wiki/Andy_Luckey \"Andy Luckey\"), the son of legendary animator [Bud\nLuckey](/wiki/Bud_Luckey \"Bud Luckey\"), Pixar's fifth employee and the creator\nof Woody. Luckey has declined to publicly comment on the connection.\n\nIn the DVD feature for _Toy Story 3_ on the voice cast, the Pixar crew remark\nthat they weren't sure if Morris would want to do it or would sound right, and\nwere ecstatic when they heard his voice on an answering machine, Morris was\nperfect for teenage Andy.\n\n#### Bonnie\nAnderson[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=69\n\"Edit section: Bonnie Anderson\")]\n\nVoiced by [Emily Hahn](/wiki/Emily_Hahn_\\(actress\\) \"Emily Hahn \\(actress\\)\")\n\n**Bonnie Anderson** appears in _Toy Story 3_ as one of the children who goes\nto Sunnyside Daycare. She becomes the owner of Woody, Buzz and the other toys\nat the end of the film. Although she has an active imagination and boisterous\nmanner when playing with her toys, she is shy and withdrawn when she is around\nadults, but she quickly warms up to Andy, when he donates his toys to her. She\nfinds Woody, who was trying to escape Sunnyside, takes him home, and plays\nwith him. Woody is impressed by what he sees at her house and ultimately gets\nhimself (and all of Andy's other toys) donated to her. Andy briefly plays with\nher after handing over his toys, and tells her he needs someone \"very special\"\nto take care of them for him.\n\nIn the short film _[Hawaiian Vacation](/wiki/Hawaiian_Vacation \"Hawaiian\nVacation\")_ , Bonnie goes on a vacation to Hawaii and leaves Barbie and Ken in\nher room.\n\n#### Molly\nDavis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=70\n\"Edit section: Molly Davis\")]\n\nVoiced by:\n\n  * Hannah Unkrich— _Toy Story_ , _Toy Story 2_\n  * [Bea Miller](/wiki/Bea_Miller \"Bea Miller\")— _Toy Story 3_\n\n**Molly Davis** is Andy's younger sister, seen as an infant in the first film,\na toddler in the second film, and as a preteen in the third film. Andy uses\nher crib as the town jail during playtime at the beginning of the first film,\nimplying they are sharing a room. When the family moves later in the film,\nAndy and Molly get separate rooms, though Molly has plans to move into Andy's\npresumably larger room once he leaves for college. In the first film, she\nslobbers on Mr. Potato Head and throws him from the crib, causing his parts to\nscatter and earning her the nickname \"Princess Drool\" from him. At the end of\nthe film, she receives a Mrs. Potato Head toy for Christmas. In _Toy Story 3_\n, she also owned a Barbie doll, which she donates to the daycare center as she\nwas less interested in dolls and toys by that time and is now a preteen.\n\n#### Mrs.\nDavis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=71\n\"Edit section: Mrs. Davis\")]\n\nVoiced by [Laurie Metcalf](/wiki/Laurie_Metcalf \"Laurie Metcalf\")\n(1995–present)\n\n**Mrs. Davis** is Andy and Molly's single mother. In the first film, she has\nbrown hair and ties it in a ponytail. In the other two films, her physical\nappearance is noticeably different and instead of brown, she has blonde hair\nand leaves it down. Though presented as a loving mother to Andy and Molly,\nMrs. Davis is actually a major (though indirect) threat to the toys, as she\nfrequently asks Andy to throw out the toys he no longer wants. Mrs. Davis’\nactions regarding the toys sets the plot in motion in all three films, though\nthey are not malicious. In the first film, she purchases a Buzz Lightyear toy\nfor Andy on his birthday, prompting the rivalry between Buzz and Woody which\nleads to them being lost and forced to find their way home. In the second\nfilm, she puts Wheezy up for sale at a yard sale (due to a broken squeaker),\nprompting Woody's rescue attempt where he is subsequently stolen by Al. In the\nthird film, she orders Andy to clean out his room before going to college and\nmistakenly throws away the bag of toys Andy was putting in the attic, causing\nthem to be donated to a daycare center. Despite this, in the second film, she\nis overly protective of Woody, describing him as an old family toy. At the end\nof the third film, she breaks down and weeps at the departure of her first\nson, but Andy reassures her that she will always be with him even if they are\napart. This moment between mother and son plays a major factor in Woody\ndeciding to have Andy donate his toys to Bonnie, thus giving them a new lease\non their lives.\n\nSome 2014 articles explore the possibility that Mrs. Davis is Jessie's\noriginal owner, Emily from her flashback memories. The evidence cited\nreferences the flashbacks of Jessie and Emily from _Toy Story 2_. The\nflashback sequence shows Emily as a child in the 1960s, which is when she\nwould have been a child. The sequence also shows that the cowboy hat that\nEmily had is very similar to Andy's hat but with an additional white lace\narea, and Emily's hair was brown, just like Mrs. Davis's hair in the first\nfilm.[12][13]\n\n#### Sid\nPhillips[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=72\n\"Edit section: Sid Phillips\")]\n\nVoiced by [Erik von Detten](/wiki/Erik_von_Detten \"Erik von Detten\")\n\n**Sid Phillips** is Andy's neighbor until Andy moves, but it is unknown if he\nand Andy know each other. Sid is known for torturing and destroying toys. Many\nof his toys are either destroyed, have missing pieces, or replaced with parts\nfrom other toys, even Sid \"torturing\" Woody by burning his forehead with a\nmagnifying glass. He is also shown tormenting his sister and destroying her\ntoys by certain methods such as exploding, burning, and decapitating them. He\nalso enjoys [skateboarding](/wiki/Skateboard \"Skateboard\"), and his shirt\ndepicts the logo for [Zero Skateboards](/wiki/Zero_Skateboards \"Zero\nSkateboards\"). The toys mention that he was consistently kicked out of summer\ncamp; and in the audio commentary on the tenth anniversary DVD, the directors\nmention that he is a bully but also the \"most creative character in the\nmovie\". It is also implied that he does not have the best home life. His\nparents do not make any major appearances: his mother's voice is only heard\nbriefly several times in the film, and his father is only seen briefly asleep\non a chair in front of the TV in the living room.\n\nHe also seems to be the only human depicted in the film to observe toys\nactually coming to life. At the end of the first film, Woody and Sid's mutant\ntoys decide to rescue Buzz by scaring Sid, which causes him to become very\nfrightened of toys. The last straw is Woody coming alive and telling him to\ntake good care of his toys or else. This causes Sid to panic and run back into\nhis house screaming, and then to his room when his sister scares him with her\ntoy doll.\n\nSid does not appear in the second film, although he is mentioned once by Buzz\nduring the toys' mission to rescue Woody from the greedy toy collector Al\nMcWhiggin. Sid also appears in the four-issue _[Monsters,\nInc.](/wiki/Monsters,_Inc. \"Monsters, Inc.\")_ comic mini-series produced by\n[Boom! Comics](/wiki/Boom!_Comics \"Boom! Comics\").\n\nIn the third film, Sid (now an adult) makes brief appearances in two scenes\nonce again voiced by Erik von Detten. He is shown to be a garbageman with a\nsmall beard, recognizable by his characteristic T-shirt. His only dialogue in\nthis movie involves humming guitar riffs, and he is depicted listening to\n[heavy metal music](/wiki/Heavy_metal_music \"Heavy metal music\") through a\npair of large headphones.\n\n#### Hannah\nPhillips[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=73\n\"Edit section: Hannah Phillips\")]\n\nVoiced by [Sarah Freeman](/wiki/Sarah_Freeman_\\(actress\\) \"Sarah Freeman\n\\(actress\\)\")\n\n**Hannah Phillips** is Sid's sweet-natured, younger sister who appears a few\ntimes in the first film. In _Toy Story,_ Hannah has adjusted to her toys being\n[mutilated](/wiki/Mutilate \"Mutilate\") by Sid. Most of her dolls either have\ndifferent heads or altered body parts, and at the end of the film she finds\nenjoyment in scaring her brother after he has been horrified by Woody and the\nother toys. She spends most of the time during the movie playing with her\naltered dolls.\n\n#### Al\nMcWhiggin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=74\n\"Edit section: Al McWhiggin\")]\n\nVoiced by [Wayne Knight](/wiki/Wayne_Knight \"Wayne Knight\")\n\n**Al McWhiggin** – nicknamed \"The Chicken Man\" by Andy's toys – is the owner\nof a chain of local toy stores and also an obsessive collector of all things\nrelated to the old _Woody 's Roundup_ TV series. He steals Woody from a yard\nsale held by Andy's mother in hopes of selling him to a toy museum in Tokyo,\nJapan. He is unscrupulously obsessive, overweight, very impatient, and lazy,\nas he complains of having to \"drive all the way to work on a Saturday\",\ndespite his apartment only being across the street from the store. He is\npartially inspired by his voice actor [Wayne Knight](/wiki/Wayne_Knight \"Wayne\nKnight\"); during the production of _Toy Story 2,_ Knight had a goatee like Al\nin the movie. Cartoonist and animator [Scott Shaw](/wiki/Scott_Shaw_\\(artist\\)\n\"Scott Shaw \\(artist\\)\") has also been acknowledged as another model and\ninspiration for Al.\n\nAl is the owner of a large toy store called \"Al's Toy Barn\". The store is\nmentioned in the first _Toy Story_ in an advertisement for Buzz Lightyear\ntoys, but Al did not appear. He is first seen in _Toy Story 2_ during an\nadvertisement on TV in which he is dressed up in a chicken suit of which Hamm\nremarks \"I despise that chicken\" after turning off the TV. He later is seen\ntrying to buy [Woody](/wiki/Sheriff_Woody \"Sheriff Woody\") in a yard sale held\nby Andy's mom. After Andy's mother refuses to hand over the doll and locks him\nin a box, Al steals Woody with the intent of selling him, along with the rest\nof his collection of _Woody 's Roundup_ toys and memorabilia, to a Japanese\ntoy museum for a large sum of money. Andy's toys arrived at his apartment to\nrescue Woody but Stinky Pete's interference allow Al to leave for the airport\nwith the Roundup Gang. Andy's toys follow him there on a stolen pizza planet\ntruck. (In the original script, Andy's toys steal Al's car and Al steals the\npizza planet truck and gives chase) As Al's plane is about to fly off to Japan\nwith the Roundup Gang packed in the luggage, Andy's toys are able to save\nWoody, Jessie and Bullseye, getting Jessie off of the plane at the last\nsecond, while the Prospector is placed in a little girl's backpack for his\nbetrayal. During his latest commercial soon after, Al is unable to control\nhimself from hysterically sobbing over his losses as a result, which Hamm\nresponded to by saying \"Well, I guess crime doesn't pay.\"\n\nAl was originally conceived to appear in the first _Toy Story_ film, but was\ncut in the final screenplay.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\nHowever, Al's Toy Barn makes an appearance in the first film during a\ntelevision advertisement for Buzz Lightyear toys.\n\nAl's last name was revealed on the nameplate on his office desk; also, when he\nis done taking pictures, he answers his cellphone and Mr. Konishi can be heard\nsaying his full name. According to _[Disney\nAdventures](/wiki/Disney_Adventures \"Disney Adventures\")_ magazine, Al was not\npermitted to play with his toys when he was a kid, which led to his toy-\ncollecting niche. It is implied that Al's full name is actually Carl McWhiggin\nsince Mr. Konishi is heard calling him that on the phone.\n\nHis car's license plate reads LZTYBRN, which is \"Al's Toy Barn\" (minus the\n[vowel](/wiki/Vowel \"Vowel\") letters). It is also the actual license plate of\nAsh Brannon, co-director of _Toy Story 2,_ according to the _Toy Story 2:\nSpecial Edition_ commentary.\n\n#### Mrs.\nAnderson[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=75\n\"Edit section: Mrs. Anderson\")]\n\nVoiced by [Lori Alan](/wiki/Lori_Alan \"Lori Alan\")\n\n**Mrs. Anderson** is the mother of Bonnie.

During the credits scene,\nshe carries another box of donation toys into the Butterfly Room at Sunnyside\nthat contains Emperor Zurg.\n\nIn _Toy Story of Terror_ , she and Bonnie are driving in the countryside at\nnighttime when the car tire punctures. In the morning, the curtain behind the\nmanager's desk fell down revealing all her missing toys. Mrs. Anderson calls\nthe police to arrest the manager who stole the toys.\n\n#### Geri the\nCleaner[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=76\n\"Edit section: Geri the Cleaner\")]\n\nVoiced by [Jonathan Harris](/wiki/Jonathan_Harris \"Jonathan Harris\")\n\n**Geri** , an elderly specialist in toy restoration and repair with a fully\nloaded toy repair kit, comes to Al's apartment in _Toy Story 2_ to fix Woody\nup in preparation for his trip to [Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\"). He insists\nthat Al let him take his time with the work and views it as more than a simple\njob, asserting, \"You can't rush art.\"\n\nGeri previously appeared in Pixar's 1997 short, _[Geri's\nGame](/wiki/Geri%27s_Game \"Geri's Game\")_, where he plays a chess game against\nhimself. In that short, he is voiced by [Bob\nPeterson](/wiki/Bob_Peterson_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Bob Peterson \\(filmmaker\\)\"). One\nof the drawers in his carrying case contains chess pieces, a reference to the\nshort.\n\n####\nEmily[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=77\n\"Edit section: Emily\")]\n\n**Emily** was the name of Jessie's former owner and is mentioned by her in the\nsecond film. She appears in a flashback musical sequence while \"When She Loved\nMe\" by [Sarah McLachlan](/wiki/Sarah_McLachlan \"Sarah McLachlan\") is played.\nDuring this sequence, Jessie tells Woody of her first experience with an owner\nwho was Emily and why she resented being a child's toy. As a young child she\nwas a fan of the Wild West and horses, along with the _Woody 's Roundup_ TV\nshow, apparent through her love of Jessie. As she became a teenager, her\ninterest began to shift towards makeup, pop culture of the time and gossip\nwith her friends which led to Jessie being neglected then thrown away through\na donation box. She is mentioned by Jessie for the second time in the third\nfilm, when she fears of being thrown away by Andy, saying \"I should've seen\nthis coming! It's Emily all over again!\".\n\n####\nDaisy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=78\n\"Edit section: Daisy\")]\n\n**Daisy** is a little girl who appears in\n[flashbacks](/wiki/Flashback_\\(narrative\\) \"Flashback \\(narrative\\)\") in _Toy\nStory 3_.

In order to\npacify her, Daisy's parents bought her another Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear rather\nthan finding Lotso and the rest of her toys, which made Lotso think he had\nbeen replaced and forgotten about, and changed him into a sinister, ruthless\ntoy.\n\n####\nRon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Toy_Story_characters&action=edit&section=79\n\"Edit section: Ron\")]\n\nVoiced by [Stephen Tobolowsky](/wiki/Stephen_Tobolowsky \"Stephen Tobolowsky\")\n\n**Ron** is the greedy manager of the Sleep Well Motel, appearing in _Toy Story\nof Terror_.
