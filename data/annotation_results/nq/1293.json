On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude'\nin the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming\nto see us.\"[9]\n\nI started with the idea \"Hey Jules,\" which was Julian, don't make it bad, take\na sad song and make it better. Hey, try and deal with this terrible thing. I\nknew it was not going to be easy for him. I always feel sorry for kids in\ndivorces...[8]\n\n– [Paul McCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\"), 1997\n\nThe song's original title was \"Hey Jules\", and it was intended to comfort\nJulian Lennon from the stress of his parents' separation.[4] McCartney later\nsaid, \"I knew it was not going to be easy for him\", and that he changed the\nname to \"Jude\" \"because I thought that sounded a bit better\".[8]\n\nAccording to music journalist Chris Hunt, in the weeks after writing the song,\nMcCartney \"test[ed] his latest composition on anyone too polite to refuse. And\nthat meant _everyone_.\"[10] On 30 June, after recording the [Black Dyke Mills\nBand](/wiki/Black_Dyke_Mills_Band \"Black Dyke Mills Band\")'s rendition of his\ninstrumental \"Thingumybob\", in [Yorkshire](/wiki/Yorkshire \"Yorkshire\"),\nMcCartney stopped at a village in [Bedfordshire](/wiki/Bedfordshire\n\"Bedfordshire\") and performed \"Hey Jude\" at a local pub.[11] He also regaled\nmembers of [the Bonzo Dog Band](/wiki/The_Bonzo_Dog_Band \"The Bonzo Dog Band\")\nwith the song while producing their single \"[I'm the Urban\nSpaceman](/wiki/I%27m_the_Urban_Spaceman \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\")\", in\nLondon, and interrupted a recording session by [the Barron\nKnights](/wiki/The_Barron_Knights \"The Barron Knights\") to do the same.[10]\nRon Griffith of the group the Iveys – soon to be known as\n[Badfinger](/wiki/Badfinger \"Badfinger\") and, like the Black Dyke Mills Band,\nan early signing to the Beatles' new record label [Apple\nRecords](/wiki/Apple_Records \"Apple Records\") – later recalled that on their\nfirst day in the studio, McCartney \"gave us a full concert rendition of 'Hey\nJude'\".[12][nb 1]\n\nWhen introducing the composition to Lennon, McCartney assured him that he\nwould \"fix\" the line \"the movement you need is on your shoulder\", reasoning\nthat \"it's a stupid expression; it sounds like a parrot.\" Lennon replied: \"You\nwon't, you know. That's the best line in the song.\"[13] McCartney retained the\nphrase;[4] he later said of his subsequent live performances of the song:\n\"that's the line when I think of John, and sometimes I get a little emotional\nduring that moment.\"[13]\n\nIf you think about it ... Yoko's just come into the picture. He's saying.\n\"Hey, Jude – Hey, John.\" I know I'm sounding like one of those fans who reads\nthings into it, but you can _hear_ it as a song to me ... Subconsciously, he\nwas saying, Go ahead, leave me. On a conscious level, he didn't want me to go\nahead.[14]\n\n– [John Lennon](/wiki/John_Lennon \"John Lennon\"), 1980\n\nAlthough McCartney originally wrote \"Hey Jude\" for Julian, John Lennon thought\nit had actually been written for him. In a 1980 interview, Lennon stated that\nhe \"always heard it as a song to me\" and contended that, on one level,\nMcCartney was giving his blessing to Lennon and Ono's relationship, while, on\nanother, he was disappointed to be usurped as Lennon's friend and songwriting\npartner.[14]\n\nOther people believed McCartney wrote the song about them, including Judith\nSimons, a journalist with the _[Daily Express](/wiki/Daily_Express \"Daily\nExpress\")_.[15] Still others, including Lennon, have speculated that in the\nlyrics to \"Hey Jude\", McCartney's failing long-term relationship with [Jane\nAsher](/wiki/Jane_Asher \"Jane Asher\") provided an unconscious \"message to\nhimself\".[16] McCartney and Asher had announced their engagement on 25\nDecember 1967,[17] yet he began an affair with [Linda\nEastman](/wiki/Linda_McCartney \"Linda McCartney\") in June 1968;[18] that same\nmonth, [Francie Schwartz](/wiki/Francie_Schwartz \"Francie Schwartz\"), an\nAmerican who was in London to discuss a film proposal with Apple, began living\nwith McCartney at his [St John's Wood](/wiki/St_John%27s_Wood \"St John's\nWood\") home.[19][20] When Lennon mentioned that he thought the song was about\nhim and Ono, McCartney denied it and told Lennon he had written the song about\nhimself.[21][nb 2]\n\nAuthor [Mark Hertsgaard](/wiki/Mark_Hertsgaard \"Mark Hertsgaard\") has\ncommented that \"many of the song's lyrics do seem directed more at a grown man\non the verge of a powerful new love, especially the lines 'you have found her\nnow go and get her' and 'you're waiting for someone to perform with.'\"[21]\nMusic critic and author [Tim Riley](/wiki/Tim_Riley_\\(music_critic\\) \"Tim\nRiley \\(music critic\\)\") writes: \"If the song is about self-worth and self-\nconsolation in the face of hardship, the vocal performance itself conveys much\nof the journey. He begins by singing to comfort someone else, finds himself\nweighing his own feelings in the process, and finally, in the repeated\nrefrains that nurture his own approbation, he comes to believe in\nhimself.\"[23]\n\n## Production[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hey_Jude&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Production\")]\n\n### Abbey Road\nrehearsals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hey_Jude&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Abbey Road rehearsals\")]\n\nHaving earmarked the song for release as a single, the Beatles recorded \"Hey\nJude\" during the sessions for their [self-titled double\nalbum](/wiki/The_Beatles_\\(album\\) \"The Beatles \\(album\\)\"), commonly known as\n\"the White Album\".[24][25] The sessions were marked by an element of discord\nwithin the group for the first time, partly as a result of Ono's constant\npresence at Lennon's side,[26][27] and also reflective of the four band\nmembers' divergence following their [communal trip to\nRishikesh](/wiki/The_Beatles_in_India \"The Beatles in India\") in the spring of\n1968 to study [Transcendental Meditation](/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation\n\"Transcendental Meditation\").[28] Author [Peter Doggett](/wiki/Peter_Doggett\n\"Peter Doggett\") describes the completed version of \"Hey Jude\" as a song that\n\"glowed with optimism after a summer that had burned with anxiety and rage\nwithin the group\".[29]\n\nThe Beatles first taped 25 [takes](/wiki/Take \"Take\") of the song at\n[EMI](/wiki/EMI \"EMI\")'s [Abbey Road Studios](/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios \"Abbey\nRoad Studios\") in London over two nights, 29 and 30 July 1968,[24] with\n[George Martin](/wiki/George_Martin \"George Martin\") as their producer.[30]\nThese dates served as rehearsals, however, since they planned to record the\nmaster track at [Trident Studios](/wiki/Trident_Studios \"Trident Studios\") to\nutilise their [eight-track recording machine](/wiki/Multitrack_recording\n\"Multitrack recording\") (Abbey Road was still limited to four-tracks).[24] A\ntake from 29 July, which author and critic [Kenneth\nWomack](/wiki/Kenneth_Womack \"Kenneth Womack\") describes as a \"jovial\"\nsession,[31] was issued on the _[Anthology 3](/wiki/Anthology_3 \"Anthology\n3\")_ compilation in 1996.[32]\n\nThe 30 July rehearsals were filmed for a short documentary titled _Music!_[33]\nHowever, the film shows only three of the Beatles performing \"Hey Jude\", as\n[George Harrison](/wiki/George_Harrison \"George Harrison\") remained in the\nstudio control room,[34] with Martin and EMI recording engineer [Ken\nScott](/wiki/Ken_Scott \"Ken Scott\").[35][nb 3] Author Simon Leng views this as\nindicative of how Harrison was increasingly allowed little room to develop\nideas on McCartney compositions, whereas he was free to create empathetic\nguitar parts for Lennon's songs of the period.[37]\n\nDuring the rehearsals that day,[35] Harrison and McCartney had a heated\ndisagreement over the lead guitar part for the song.[31] Harrison's idea was\nto play a guitar phrase as a response to each line of the vocal,[38] which did\nnot fit with McCartney's conception of the song's arrangement, and he vetoed\nit.[39][40] In a 1994 interview, McCartney said, \"looking back on it, I think,\nOkay. Well, it was bossy, but it was ballsy of me, because I could have bowed\nto the pressure.\"[40] [Ron Richards](/wiki/Ron_Richards_\\(producer\\) \"Ron\nRichards \\(producer\\)\"), a record producer who worked for Martin at both\n[Parlophone](/wiki/Parlophone \"Parlophone\") and [AIR\nStudios](/wiki/Associated_Independent_Recording \"Associated Independent\nRecording\"),[41] said McCartney was \"oblivious to anyone else's feelings in\nthe studio\", and that he was driven to making the best possible record, at\nalmost any cost.[42][nb 4]\n\n### Trident Studios\nrecording[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hey_Jude&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Trident Studios recording\")]\n\nThe master track for \"Hey Jude\" was recorded at Trident Studios on 31\nJuly.[33] Trident's founder, [Norman Sheffield](/wiki/Norman_Sheffield \"Norman\nSheffield\"), recalled that [Mal Evans](/wiki/Mal_Evans \"Mal Evans\"), the\nBeatles' aide and former roadie, insisted that some pot plants he had brought\nbe placed in the studio to make the place \"soft\", consistent with the band's\nwishes.[46] Sheffield served as [recording engineer](/wiki/Recording_engineer\n\"Recording engineer\") for the session. The line-up on the basic track was\nMcCartney on piano and lead vocal, Lennon on acoustic guitar, Harrison on\nelectric guitar, and [Ringo Starr](/wiki/Ringo_Starr \"Ringo Starr\") on\ndrums.[39]\n\nThe Beatles recorded four takes of \"Hey Jude\", the first of which was selected\nas the master.[39] With drums absent for the first 50 seconds of the song,\nMcCartney began this take unaware that Starr had just left for a toilet break.\nStarr soon returned – \"tiptoeing past my back rather quickly\", in McCartney's\nrecollection – and performed his cue perfectly. McCartney added: \"his timing\nwas absolutely impeccable.\"[40]\n\nOn 1 August, the group carried out [overdubs](/wiki/Overdubbing \"Overdubbing\")\non the basic track, again at Trident. These additions included McCartney's\nlead vocal and bass guitar; backing vocals from Lennon, McCartney and\nHarrison; and tambourine,[34] played by Starr.[47] They then added a 36-piece\norchestra over the long [coda](/wiki/Coda_\\(music\\) \"Coda \\(music\\)\"), scored\nby Martin.[39] The orchestra consisted of ten violins, three violas, three\ncellos, two flutes, one contra bassoon, one bassoon, two clarinets, one contra\nbass clarinet, four trumpets, four trombones, two horns, percussion and two\nstring basses.[47] With the introduction of what musicologist [Walter\nEverett](/wiki/Walter_Everett_\\(musicologist\\) \"Walter Everett\n\\(musicologist\\)\") terms the \"bottom-heavy\" orchestral instruments,\nparticularly the string basses, McCartney's bass part was cut from the start\nof the coda onwards.[48]\n\nAccording to Sheffield, there was dissension initially among the orchestral\nmusicians, some of whom \"were looking down their noses at the Beatles, I\nthink\". Sheffield recalls that McCartney ensured their cooperation by\ndemanding: \"Do you guys want to get fucking paid or not?\" During the first few\ntakes, McCartney was unhappy about the lack of energy and passion in the\norchestra's performance, so he stood up on the grand piano and started\nconducting the musicians from there.[49]\n\nThe Beatles then asked the orchestra members if they would clap their hands\nand sing along to the refrain in the coda. All but one of the musicians\ncomplied (for a double fee), with the abstainer reportedly saying, \"I'm not\ngoing to clap my hands and sing Paul McCartney's bloody song!\"[39] Apple\nRecords assistant Chris O'Dell says she joined the cast of backing singers on\nthe song;[50] one of the label's first signings, [Jackie\nLomax](/wiki/Jackie_Lomax \"Jackie Lomax\"), also recalled participating.[51]\n\nTrident was paid £25 per hour by EMI for the \"Hey Jude\" sessions. Sheffield\nsaid that the studio earned about £1000 in total at the time, but by having\nthe Beatles record there, and in turn raving about the facility, the value was\nincalculable.[52] The band carried out further work at Trident during\n1968,[53] and Apple artists such as Lomax, [Mary Hopkin](/wiki/Mary_Hopkin\n\"Mary Hopkin\"), [Billy Preston](/wiki/Billy_Preston \"Billy Preston\") and the\nIveys all recorded there over the next year.[54][nb 5]\n\n### Mixing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hey_Jude&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Mixing\")]\n\nScott, Martin and the Beatles mixed the finished recording at Abbey Road.[10]\nThe transfer of the Trident master tape to [acetate](/wiki/Acetate_disc\n\"Acetate disc\") proved problematic due to the recording sounding murky when\nplayed back on EMI's equipment.[10] The issue was resolved with the help of\n[Geoff Emerick](/wiki/Geoff_Emerick \"Geoff Emerick\"),[55][56] whom Scott had\nrecently replaced as the Beatles' principal recording engineer.[57] Emerick\nhappened to be visiting Abbey Road,[58] having recently refused to work with\nthe Beatles any longer, due to the tension and abuse that had become\ncommonplace at their recording sessions.[59][60] A stereo mix of \"Hey Jude\"\nwas then completed on 2 August and the mono version on 8 August.[61][nb 6]\n\nEverett writes that the song's \"most commented-on feature\" is its considerable\nlength, at 7:11.[63] The precedent for issuing such a long track on a single\nhad recently been set by [Richard Harris](/wiki/Richard_Harris \"Richard\nHarris\")' hit recording of \"[MacArthur Park](/wiki/MacArthur_Park_\\(song\\)\n\"MacArthur Park \\(song\\)\")\",[64] the composer of which, [Jimmy\nWebb](/wiki/Jimmy_Webb \"Jimmy Webb\"), was a visitor to the studio around this\ntime.[65] According to Webb, Martin admitted to him that \"Hey Jude\" was only\nallowed to run over seven minutes because of the success of \"MacArthur\nPark\".[66]\n\nIn the song's final bridge section, at 2:58,[67] the spoken phrase \"Fucking\nhell!\" appears. Scott admits that although he was told about it, he could not\nhear the words originally.[10] Lennon attributed the expletive to McCartney,\naccording to Emerick,[56] who reports Lennon's comment in his autobiography:\n\"'Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word,' Lennon gleefully\ncrowed, 'but I insisted we leave it in [at Trident], buried just low enough so\nthat it can barely be heard. Most people won't ever spot it ... but we'll know\nit's there.'\"[68] Womack considers that the expletive was actually uttered by\nLennon.[67] [Malcolm Toft](/wiki/Malcolm_Toft \"Malcolm Toft\"), the mix\nengineer on the Trident recording,[69] also attributes it to Lennon.[70] In\nToft's recollection, Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when, in\nreaction to the volume being too loud in his headphones, he first called out\n\"Whoa!\" then, two seconds later, swore as he pulled the headphones off.[71][nb\n7]\n\n## Composition and\nstructure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hey_Jude&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Composition and structure\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/HeyJude68sheet.jpg/145px-\nHeyJude68sheet.jpg)](/wiki/File:HeyJude68sheet.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HeyJude68sheet.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n1968 sheet music cover (Maclen Music, Inc., New York)\n\n\"Hey Jude\" begins with McCartney singing lead vocals and playing the piano.\nThe patterns he plays are based on three chords: F, C, and B♭ (I, V and\nIV).[1] The main chord progression is \"flipped on its head\", in Hertsgaard's\nwords, for the coda, since the C chord is replaced by E♭.[72] Everett comments\nthat McCartney's melody over the verses borrows in part from [John\nIreland](/wiki/John_Ireland_\\(composer\\) \"John Ireland \\(composer\\)\")'s 1907\n[liturgical](/wiki/Liturgical_music \"Liturgical music\") piece _Te Deum_ , as\nwell as (with the first change to a B♭ chord) suggesting the influence of [the\nDrifters](/wiki/The_Drifters \"The Drifters\")' 1960 hit \"[Save the Last Dance\nfor Me](/wiki/Save_the_Last_Dance_for_Me \"Save the Last Dance for Me\")\".[63]\n\nThe second verse of the song adds accompaniment from acoustic guitar and\ntambourine. Tim Riley writes that, with the \"restrained tom-tom and cymbal\nfill\" that introduces the drum part, \"the piano shifts downward to add a flat\nseventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of\narrival ('And any time you feel the _pain_ ').\"[73] At the end of each bridge,\nMcCartney sings a brief phrase (\"Na-na-na na …\"), supported by an electric\nguitar fill,[34] before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse.\nAccording to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to \"reorient the harmony for the\nverse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside\". Additional\nmusical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies\naccompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the\nfour-verse, two-bridge song.[74]\n\nThe verse-bridge structure persists for approximately three minutes, after\nwhich the band leads into a four-minute-long coda, consisting of nineteen\nrounds of the song's double [plagal cadence](/wiki/Plagal_cadence \"Plagal\ncadence\").[63] During this coda, the rest of the band, backed by an orchestra\nthat also provides backing vocals, repeats the phrase \"Na-na-na na\" followed\nby the words \"hey Jude\" until the song gradually fades out. In his analysis of\nthe composition, musicologist [Alan Pollack](/wiki/Alan_W._Pollack \"Alan W.\nPollack\") comments on the unusual structure of \"Hey Jude\", in that it uses a\n\"binary form that combines a fully developed, hymn-like song together with an\nextended, [mantra](/wiki/Mantra \"Mantra\")-like jam on a simple chord\nprogression\".[75]\n\nRiley considers that the coda's repeated chord sequence (I-♭VII-IV-I) \"answers\nall the musical questions raised at the beginnings and ends of bridges\", since\n\"The flat seventh that posed dominant turns into bridges now has an entire\nchord built on it.\" This three-chord refrain allows McCartney \"a bedding ...\nto leap about on vocally\",[76] so he ad-libs his vocal performance for the\nrest of the song. In Riley's estimation, the song \"becomes a tour of Paul's\nvocal range: from the graceful inviting tones of the opening verse, through\nthe mounting excitement of the song itself, to the surging raves of the\ncoda\".[23]\n\n## Release[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hey_Jude&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Release\")]\n\n[The Beatles] are confident and cheerful and the human condition will be\nthrilled by the coming results of their willing and enduring Beatle bondage …\nthey will give all of us new wonders to soothe our pain.[77]\n\n– [Derek Taylor](/wiki/Derek_Taylor \"Derek Taylor\"), \"Hey Jude\" press release,\nAugust 1968\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was released on 26 August 1968 in the United States and 30 August\nin the United Kingdom,[78] backed with\n\"[Revolution](/wiki/Revolution_\\(Beatles_song\\) \"Revolution \\(Beatles\nsong\\)\")\" on the [B-side](/wiki/A-side_and_B-side \"A-side and B-side\") of a 7\"\nsingle.[79] It was one of four singles issued simultaneously to launch Apple\nRecords – the others being Mary Hopkin's \"[Those Were the\nDays](/wiki/Those_Were_the_Days_\\(song\\) \"Those Were the Days \\(song\\)\")\",\nJackie Lomax's \"[Sour Milk Sea](/wiki/Sour_Milk_Sea \"Sour Milk Sea\")\", and the\nBlack Dyke Mills Band's \"Thingumybob\".[80] In advance of the release date,\nApple declared 11–18 August to be \"National Apple Week\" in the UK,[80][81] and\nsent gift-wrapped boxes of the records, marked \"Our First Four\", to [Queen\nElizabeth II](/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II \"Queen Elizabeth II\") and other members\nof the [royal family](/wiki/British_Royal_Family \"British Royal Family\"), and\nto [Harold Wilson](/wiki/Harold_Wilson \"Harold Wilson\"), the prime minister at\nthe time.[82] The release was promoted by [Derek Taylor](/wiki/Derek_Taylor\n\"Derek Taylor\"), who, in Doggett's description, \"hyped the first Apple records\nwith typical elan\".[83] \"Hey Jude\" was the first of the four singles, since it\nwas still designated as an EMI/Parlophone release in the UK and a\n[Capitol](/wiki/Capitol_Records \"Capitol Records\") release in the US, but with\nthe Apple Records logo now added.[84][nb 8] In the US, \"Hey Jude\" was the\nfirst Beatles single to be issued in a company sleeve rather than a picture\nsleeve.[86]\n\nLennon wanted \"Revolution\" to be the A-side of the single, but the other\nBeatles did not agree.[87] In his 1970 interview with _[Rolling\nStone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ , he said \"Hey Jude\" was worthy\nof an A-side, \"but we could have had both.\"[88] In 1980, he told\n_[Playboy](/wiki/Playboy \"Playboy\")_ he still disagreed with the decision.[89]\n\nThe single was a highly successful debut for Apple Records,[90] and contrasted\nwith the public embarrassment the band faced after the recent closure of their\nshort-lived retail venture, [Apple Boutique](/wiki/Apple_Boutique \"Apple\nBoutique\").[55] \"Hey Jude\" began its sixteen-week run on Britain's [official\nsingles chart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\") on 7 September 1968,\nclaiming the top spot a week later. It lasted two weeks on top before being\nreplaced by Hopkin's \"Those Were the Days\", which was produced by\nMcCartney.[91] \"Hey Jude\" was certified [gold](/wiki/RIAA_certification \"RIAA\ncertification\") by the [Recording Industry Association of\nAmerica](/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America \"Recording Industry\nAssociation of America\") (RIAA) on 13 September; that same week,\n_[NME](/wiki/NME \"NME\")_ reported that two million copies of the single had\nbeen sold.[92] The song entered the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") in the US on 14 September,\nbeginning a nineteen-week chart run there.[93] It reached number one on 28\nSeptember and held that position for nine weeks,[94] for three of which,\n\"Those Were the Days\" held the number-two spot.[93] This was the longest time\nspent by a Beatles single at number one,[95] as well as being the longest-\nplaying single to reach number one.[94] The song was the 16th number-one hit\nfor the band in America, tying [Elvis Presley](/wiki/Elvis_Presley \"Elvis\nPresley\")'s record at the time for most number-one songs there. _Billboard_\nranked it as the [number-one song for 1968](/wiki/Billboard_Year-\nEnd_Hot_100_singles_of_1968 \"Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1968\").[94]\n\nIn the UK, where \"MacArthur Park\" had failed to top the chart, \"Hey Jude\"\nremained the longest number-one hit for nearly a quarter of a century. It was\nsurpassed in 1993 by [Meat Loaf](/wiki/Meat_Loaf \"Meat Loaf\")'s \"[I'd Do\nAnything for Love (But I Won't Do\nThat)](/wiki/I%27d_Do_Anything_for_Love_\\(But_I_Won%27t_Do_That\\) \"I'd Do\nAnything for Love \\(But I Won't Do That\\)\")\", which ran to 7:52 as a\nsingle.[96]\n\nOn 30 November 1968, _NME_ reported that sales had reached nearly six million\ncopies worldwide.[97][98] \"Hey Jude\" became the biggest-selling debut release\nfor a record label ever, selling an estimated eight million copies worldwide\nand topping the charts in eleven countries.[91] In 1999, it was certified [4x\nplatinum](/wiki/RIAA_certification \"RIAA certification\") by the RIAA,\nrepresenting four million units shipped in the US.[99]\n\n## Promotion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hey_Jude&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Promotion\")]\n\nA failed early promotional attempt for the single took place after the\nBeatles' all-night recording session on 7–8 August 1968.[100] With Apple\nBoutique having closed a week before, McCartney and his girlfriend, Francie\nSchwartz, painted _Hey Jude/Revolution_ across its large,\n[whitewashed](/wiki/Whitewash \"Whitewash\") shop windows.[101] The words were\nmistaken for [anti-Semitic](/wiki/Anti-Semitism \"Anti-Semitism\") graffiti\n(since _Jude_ means \"Jew\" in German),[101] leading to complaints from the\nlocal Jewish community,[80][102] and the windows being smashed by passers-\nby.[103] Discussing the episode in _[The Beatles\nAnthology](/wiki/The_Beatles_Anthology_\\(book\\) \"The Beatles Anthology\n\\(book\\)\")_ , McCartney explained that he had been motivated by the location –\n\"Great opportunity. [Baker Street](/wiki/Baker_Street \"Baker Street\"),\nmillions of buses going around …\" – and added: \"I had no idea it meant 'Jew',\nbut if you look at footage of [Nazi Germany](/wiki/Nazi_Germany \"Nazi\nGermany\"), '_Juden Raus_ ' was written in whitewashed windows with a [Star of\nDavid](/wiki/Star_of_David \"Star of David\"). I swear it never occurred to\nme.\"[13] According to [Barry Miles](/wiki/Barry_Miles \"Barry Miles\"),\nMcCartney caused further controversy in his comments to Alan Smith of the\n_NME_ that month when he said: \"Starvation in India doesn't worry me one bit,\nnot one iota … And it doesn't worry you, if you're honest. You just\npose.\"[80][nb 9]\n\nThe Beatles hired [Michael Lindsay-Hogg](/wiki/Michael_Lindsay-Hogg \"Michael\nLindsay-Hogg\") to shoot a promotional clip for \"Hey Jude\", after he had\npreviously directed a clip for \"[Paperback Writer](/wiki/Paperback_Writer\n\"Paperback Writer\")\" in 1966. They settled on the idea of shooting with a\nlive, albeit controlled, audience. In the clip, the Beatles are first seen by\nthemselves, performing the initial chorus and verses, and then are joined by\nthe audience who appear as the last chorus concludes and coda begins; the\naudience sings and claps along with the Beatles through the song's conclusion.\nHogg shot the clip at [Twickenham Film Studios](/wiki/Twickenham_Film_Studios\n\"Twickenham Film Studios\") on 4 September 1968, with McCartney himself\ndesigning the set. Tony Bramwell, a friend of the Beatles, later described the\nset as \"the piano, there; drums, there; and orchestra in two tiers at the\nback.\"[104] The event marked Starr's return to the group, after McCartney's\ncriticism of his drumming had led to him walking out during a session for the\nWhite Album track \"[Back in the U.S.S.R.](/wiki/Back_in_the_U.S.S.R. \"Back in\nthe U.S.S.R.\")\"[105][106] During his two-week absence, Starr announced that he\nhad left the band.[104]\n\nThe final edit was a combination of several different takes[107] and included\n\"introductions\" to the song by [David Frost](/wiki/David_Frost \"David Frost\")\n(who introduced the Beatles as \"the greatest tea-room orchestra in the\nworld\"),[108] and [Cliff Richard](/wiki/Cliff_Richard \"Cliff Richard\"), for\ntheir respective, eponymous TV programmes.[107] As shooting wore on, Lennon\nrepeatedly asked Lindsay-Hogg if he had the material he needed. After 12\ntakes, McCartney said, \"I think that's enough\", and shooting concluded.[107]\nIt was first aired in the UK on _Frost on Sunday_ on 8 September 1968,[109]\nand the clip was later broadcast for the United States on _[The Smothers\nBrothers Comedy Hour](/wiki/The_Smothers_Brothers_Comedy_Hour \"The Smothers\nBrothers Comedy Hour\")_ on 6 October.[110] According to Riley, the showing on\n_Frost on Sunday_ \"kicked 'Hey Jude' into the stratosphere\" in terms of\npopularity.[111] Hertsgaard pairs it with the release of the animated film\n_[Yellow Submarine](/wiki/Yellow_Submarine_\\(film\\) \"Yellow Submarine\n\\(film\\)\")_ as two events that created \"a state of nirvana\" for Beatles fans,\nin contrast with the problems besetting the band regarding Ono's influence and\nApple.[112]\n\nThe 4 September 1968 promo clip is included in the Beatles' 2015 video\ncompilation _[1](/wiki/1_\\(Beatles_album\\) \"1 \\(Beatles album\\)\")_ , while the\nthree-disc versions of that compilation, titled _1+_ , also include an\nalternate video, with a different introduction and vocal, from the same\ndate.[113]\n\n## Critical reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hey_Jude&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Critical reception\")]\n\nUpon the single's release, Derek Johnson of the _NME_ wrote: \"The intriguing\nfeatures of 'Hey Jude' are its extreme length and the 40-piece orchestral\naccompaniment – and personally I would have preferred it without either!\"\nWhile he viewed the track overall as \"a beautiful, compelling song\", and the\nfirst three minutes as \"absolutely sensational\", Johnson rued the long coda's\n\"vocal improvisations on the basically repetitive four-bar chorus\".[114]\n_[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine described the\ncoda as \"a fadeout that engagingly spoofs the fadeout as a gimmick for ending\npop records\". The same reviewer contrasted \"Hey Jude\" with its B-side,\n\"Revolution\", saying that \"The other side of the new disk urges activism of a\ndifferent sort\", due to McCartney \"liltingly exhort[ing] a friend to overcome\nhis fears and commit himself in love\".[115] _[Rolling\nStone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ also attributed the song's\nmeaning as a message from McCartney to Lennon to end his negative\nrelationships with women: \"to break the old pattern; to really go through with\nlove\".[116] Other commentators interpreted \"Hey Jude\" as being directed at\n[Bob Dylan](/wiki/Bob_Dylan \"Bob Dylan\"), then semi-retired in\n[Woodstock](/wiki/Woodstock,_New_York \"Woodstock, New York\").[117][118]\n\nWriting in 1971, [Robert Christgau](/wiki/Robert_Christgau \"Robert Christgau\")\nof _[The Village Voice](/wiki/The_Village_Voice \"The Village Voice\")_ called\nit \"one of [McCartney's] truest and most forthright love songs\" and was\ncritical of its omission from the album _[The\nBeatles](/wiki/The_Beatles_\\(album\\) \"The Beatles \\(album\\)\")_.[119] In their\n1975 book _[The Beatles: An Illustrated\nRecord](/wiki/The_Beatles:_An_Illustrated_Record \"The Beatles: An Illustrated\nRecord\")_ , critics [Roy Carr](/wiki/Roy_Carr \"Roy Carr\") and [Tony\nTyler](/wiki/Tony_Tyler \"Tony Tyler\") wrote that \"Hey Jude\" \"promised great\nthings\" for the ill-conceived Apple enterprise and described the song as \"the\nlast great Beatles single recorded _specifically_ for the 45s market\". They\nnoted also that \"the epic proportions of the piece\" encouraged many imitators,\nyet these other artists \"[failed] to capture the gentleness and sympathy of\nthe Beatles' communal feel\".[118]\n\nAmong more recent commentators, Alan Pollack admires \"Hey Jude\" as \"such a\ngood illustration of two compositional lessons – how to fill a large canvas\nwith simple means, and how to use diverse elements such as harmony, bassline,\nand orchestration to articulate form and contrast.\"[75] Pollack considers that\nthe song's long coda provides \"an astonishingly transcendental effect\",[75]\nwhile [AllMusic](/wiki/AllMusic \"AllMusic\")'s [Richie\nUnterberger](/wiki/Richie_Unterberger \"Richie Unterberger\") similarly opines:\n\"What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic because McCartney\nvaries the vocal with some of the greatest nonsense scatting ever heard in\nrock …\"[16] In his book _[Revolution in the Head](/wiki/Revolution_in_the_Head\n\"Revolution in the Head\")_ , [Ian MacDonald](/wiki/Ian_MacDonald \"Ian\nMacDonald\") wrote that the \"pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out may be a\nblemish\" but he praised the song as \"a pop/rock hybrid drawing on the best of\nboth idioms\".[120] MacDonald concluded: \"'Hey Jude' strikes a universal note,\ntouching on an archetypal moment in male sexual psychology with a gentle\nwisdom one might properly call inspired.\"[117] Lennon said the song was \"one\nof [McCartney's] masterpieces\".[14]\n\n## Awards

notes for the song at an\nauction in 1996.\n\nJulian Lennon discovered that \"Hey Jude\" had been written for him almost 20\nyears after McCartney composed the song. He recalled of his and McCartney's\nrelationship: \"Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit – more than Dad and I\ndid. We had a great friendship going and there seems to be far more pictures\nof me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and\nmy dad.\"[12] In 1996, Julian paid £25,000 for the recording notes to \"Hey\nJude\" at an auction. He spent a further £35,000 at the auction, buying John\nLennon memorabilia. John Cousins, Julian Lennon's manager, stated at the time:\n\"He has a few photographs of his father, but not very much else. He is\ncollecting for personal reasons; these are family heirlooms if you like.\"[132]\n\nIn 2002, the original handwritten lyrics for the song were nearly auctioned\noff at [Christie's](/wiki/Christie%27s \"Christie's\") in London. The sheet of\nnotepaper with the scrawled lyrics had been expected to fetch up to £80,000 at\nthe auction, which was scheduled for 30 April 2002. McCartney went to court to\nstop the auction, claiming the paper had disappeared from his West London\nhome. Richard Morgan, representing Christie's, said McCartney had provided no\nevidence that he had ever owned the piece of paper on which the lyrics were\nwritten. The courts decided in McCartney's favour and prohibited the sale of\nthe lyrics. They had been sent to Christie's for auction by Frenchman Florrent\nTessier, who said he purchased the piece of paper at a street market stall in\nLondon for £10 in the early 1970s. In the original catalogue for the auction,\nJulian Lennon had written, \"It's very strange to think that someone has\nwritten a song about you.

the performance.[12]\n  2. **Jump up ^** In a 1971 interview with Jonathan Cott, Lennon recalled his and McCartney's conversation: \"Ah, it's me! I said, it's _me_! He says, no it's _me_. I said, check, we're going through the same bit.\"[22]\n  3. **Jump up ^** Produced by the National Music Council of Great Britain,[36] the documentary was released in October 1969.[34]\n  4. **Jump up ^** Described by [Ian MacDonald](/wiki/Ian_MacDonald \"Ian MacDonald\") as \"a tense moment\",[43] this disagreement between Harrison and McCartney was recalled by the pair in a similar argument they had while filming _[Let It Be](/wiki/Let_It_Be_\\(1970_film\\) \"Let It Be \\(1970 film\\)\")_ in January 1969,[34] regarding the lead guitar part on \"[Two of Us](/wiki/Two_of_Us_\\(song\\) \"Two of Us \\(song\\)\")\".[44] Partly as a result of McCartney's criticism, Harrison briefly quit the band on 10 January.[34][45]\n  5. **Jump up ^** In 2013 McCartney agreed to write the foreword to Sheffield's book \"Life on Two Legs\", partly because of his positive experience when recording \"Hey Jude\".\n  6. **Jump up ^** Writing in his 2006 memoir, Emerick says that \"Obviously something at Trident had been misaligned\", and the solution for \"Hey Jude\" was to add \"massive amounts of treble [equalization](/wiki/Equalization_\\(audio\\) \"Equalization \\(audio\\)\")\".[62]\n  7. **Jump up ^** Toft adds: \"because it had been bounced down [mixed] with the main vocal, it could not be removed.

Apple's other three debut singles followed a new sequencing, starting with \"Those Were the Days\", which was issued as Apple 2 and Apple 1801.[85]\n  9. **Jump up ^** Having told Smith, \"The truth about me is that I'm pleasantly insincere\", McCartney said: \"You can't pretend to me that an [Oxfam](/wiki/Oxfam \"Oxfam\") ad can reach down into the depths of your soul and actually make you feel for those [starving] people – more, for instance, than you feel about getting a new car.\"[80]\n  10. **Jump up ^** EMI archives do not record the names of the studio musicians, but it has been established that two of the cellists were [Alexander \"Bobby\" Kok](/wiki/Alexander_Kok \"Alexander Kok\") and Peter Halling, and two of the flautists were Bill Jackman and Brian Warren.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hey_Jude&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Lowry 2002, p. 44.\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Bronson, Fred (2 August 2012).
