The precise definition of the term varies\nwith the historical epoch or the geographical region under consideration. A\nsword consists of a long blade attached to a [hilt](/wiki/Hilt \"Hilt\"). The\nblade can be straight or curved. Thrusting swords have a pointed tip on the\nblade, and tend to be straighter; slashing swords have sharpened cutting edge\non one or both sides of the blade, and are more likely to be curved. Many\nswords are designed for both thrusting and slashing.\n\nHistorically, the sword developed in the [Bronze Age](/wiki/Bronze_Age \"Bronze\nAge\"), evolving from the [dagger](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\"); the [earliest\nspecimens](/wiki/Bronze_Age_sword \"Bronze Age sword\") date to about 1600 BC.\nThe later [Iron Age sword](/wiki/Iron_Age_sword \"Iron Age sword\") remained\nfairly short and without a crossguard. The [spatha](/wiki/Spatha \"Spatha\"), as\nit developed in the [Late Roman army](/wiki/Late_Roman_army \"Late Roman\narmy\"), became the predecessor of the European sword of the Middle Ages, at\nfirst adopted as the [Migration period sword](/wiki/Migration_period_sword\n\"Migration period sword\"), and only in the [High Middle\nAges](/wiki/High_Middle_Ages \"High Middle Ages\"), developed into the classical\n[arming sword](/wiki/Arming_sword \"Arming sword\") with crossguard. The word\n_[sword](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sword \"wikt:sword\")_ continues the\n[Old English](/wiki/Old_English_language \"Old English language\"),\n_[sweord](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sweord \"wikt:sweord\")_.[1]\n\nThe use of a sword is known as [swordsmanship](/wiki/Swordsmanship\n\"Swordsmanship\") or (in an early modern or modern context) as\n[fencing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fencing \"wikt:fencing\"). In the\n[Early Modern period](/wiki/Early_Modern_period \"Early Modern period\"),\nwestern sword design diverged into roughly two forms, the thrusting swords and\nthe sabers.\n\nThe thrusting swords such as the [rapier](/wiki/Rapier \"Rapier\") and\neventually the [smallsword](/wiki/Smallsword \"Smallsword\") were designed to\nimpale their targets quickly and inflict deep stab wounds. Their long and\nstraight yet light and well balanced design made them highly maneuverable and\ndeadly in a duel but fairly ineffective when used in a slashing or chopping\nmotion. A well aimed lunge and thrust could end a fight in seconds with just\nthe sword's point, leading to the development of a fighting style which\nclosely resembles modern fencing.\n\nThe saber ([sabre](/wiki/Sabre \"Sabre\")) and similar blades such as the\ncutlass were built more heavily and were more typically used in warfare. Built\nfor slashing and chopping at multiple enemies, often from horseback, the\nsaber's long curved blade and slightly forward weight balance gave it a deadly\ncharacter all its own on the battlefield. Most sabers also had sharp points\nand double edged blades, making them capable of piercing soldier after soldier\nin a cavalry charge. Sabers continued to see battlefield use until the early\n20th century. The US Navy kept tens of thousands of sturdy cutlasses in their\narmory well into [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") and many\nwere issued to marines in the Pacific as jungle machetes.\n\nNon-European weapons called \"sword\" include single-edged weapons such as the\nMiddle Eastern [scimitar](/wiki/Scimitar \"Scimitar\"), the Chinese\n[dao](/wiki/Dao_\\(sword\\) \"Dao \\(sword\\)\") and the related Japanese\n[katana](/wiki/Katana \"Katana\"). The Chinese jian is an example of a non-\nEuropean double-edged sword, like the European models derived from the double-\nedged [Iron Age sword](/wiki/Iron_Age_sword \"Iron Age sword\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Ancient history\n      * 1.1.1 Bronze Age\n      * 1.1.2 Iron Age\n      * 1.1.3 Greco-Roman antiquity\n      * 1.1.4 Persian antiquity\n      * 1.1.5 Chinese antiquity\n    * 1.2 Middle Ages\n      * 1.2.1 Europe\n      * 1.2.2 Greater Middle East\n      * 1.2.3 East Asia\n      * 1.2.4 Indian Subcontinent\n      * 1.2.5 Southeast Asia\n    * 1.3 Late Middle Ages and Renaissance\n    * 1.4 Early Modern period\n      * 1.4.1 Military sword\n      * 1.4.2 Duelling sword\n    * 1.5 Modern history\n      * 1.5.1 Military sidearm\n      * 1.5.2 Ceremonial use\n      * 1.5.3 Sword replicas\n  * 2 Morphology\n    * 2.1 Blade\n    * 2.2 Hilt\n    * 2.3 Sword scabbards and suspension\n  * 3 Typology\n    * 3.1 Single and double-edged\n      * 3.1.1 Jian\n      * 3.1.2 Kirpan\n      * 3.1.3 Churika\n      * 3.1.4 Backsword and falchion\n    * 3.2 Single vs two-handed use\n      * 3.2.1 Two-handed\n      * 3.2.2 Hand and a half sword\n  * 4 Fictional types\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n### Ancient history[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Ancient history\")]\n\nThe first weapons that can be described as \"swords\" date to around 3300 BC.\nThey have been found in [Arslantepe](/wiki/Arslantepe \"Arslantepe\"), Turkey,\nare made from [arsenical bronze](/wiki/Arsenical_bronze \"Arsenical bronze\"),\nand are about 60 cm (24 in) long.[2][3] Some of them are inlaid with\n[silver](/wiki/Silver \"Silver\").\n\n#### Bronze Age[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Bronze Age\")]\n\nMain article: [Bronze Age sword](/wiki/Bronze_Age_sword \"Bronze Age sword\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Apa_Schwerter.jpg/220px-\nApa_Schwerter.jpg)](/wiki/File:Apa_Schwerter.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Apa_Schwerter.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nApa-type swords, 17th-century BC.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Nebra_Schwerter.jpg/220px-\nNebra_Schwerter.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nebra_Schwerter.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nebra_Schwerter.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe swords found together with the [Nebra skydisk](/wiki/Nebra_skydisk \"Nebra\nskydisk\"), ca. 1600 BC.\n\nThe sword developed from the knife or dagger. A knife is unlike a\n[dagger](/wiki/Dagger \"Dagger\") in that a knife has only one cutting surface,\nwhile a dagger has two cutting surfaces. when the construction of longer\nblades became possible, from the late 3rd millennium BC in the Middle East,\nfirst in [arsenic copper](/wiki/Arsenical_copper \"Arsenical copper\"), then in\ntin-bronze.\n\nBlades longer than 60 cm (24 in) were rare and not practical until the late\nBronze Age because the [tensile strength](/wiki/Tensile_strength \"Tensile\nstrength\") of [bronze](/wiki/Bronze \"Bronze\") is relatively low, and\nconsequently longer blades would bend easily. The development of the sword out\nof the dagger was gradual; the first weapons that can be classified as swords\nwithout any ambiguity are those found in [Minoan Crete](/wiki/Minoan_Crete\n\"Minoan Crete\"), dated to about 1700 BC, reaching a total length of more than\n100 cm. These are the \"type A\" swords of the [Aegean Bronze\nAge](/wiki/Aegean_Bronze_Age \"Aegean Bronze Age\").\n\nOne of the most important, and longest-lasting, types swords of the [European\nBronze Age](/wiki/European_Bronze_Age \"European Bronze Age\") was the _Naue II_\ntype (named for [Julius Naue](/wiki/Julius_Naue \"Julius Naue\") who first\ndescribed them), also known as _Griffzungenschwert_ (lit. \"grip-tongue\nsword\"). This type first appears in c. the 13th century BC in [Northern\nItaly](/wiki/Terramare_culture \"Terramare culture\") (or a general\n[Urnfield](/wiki/Urnfield_culture \"Urnfield culture\") background), and\nsurvives well into the Iron Age, with a life-span of about seven centuries.\nDuring its lifetime, metallurgy changed from bronze [to\niron](/wiki/Iron_Age_sword \"Iron Age sword\"), but not its basic design.\n\nNaue II swords were exported from Europe to the Aegean, and as far afield as\n[Ugarit](/wiki/Ugarit \"Ugarit\"), beginning about 1200 BC, i.e. just a few\ndecades before the final collapse of the palace cultures in the [Bronze Age\ncollapse](/wiki/Bronze_Age_collapse \"Bronze Age collapse\").[4] Naue II swords\ncould be as long as 85 cm, but most specimens fall into the 60 to 70 cm range.\n[Robert Drews](/wiki/Robert_Drews \"Robert Drews\") linked the Naue Type II\nSwords, which spread from Southern Europe into the Mediterranean, with the\n[Bronze Age collapse](/wiki/Bronze_Age_collapse \"Bronze Age collapse\").[5]\nNaue II swords, along with Nordic full-hilted swords, were made with\nfunctionality and aesthetics in mind.[6] The hilts of these swords were\nbeautifully crafted and often contained false rivets in order to make the\nsword more visually appealing. Swords coming from northern Denmark and\nnorthern Germany usually contained three or more fake rivets in the hilt.[7]\n\n[Sword production in China](/wiki/Chinese_swords \"Chinese swords\") is attested\nfrom the Bronze Age [Shang Dynasty](/wiki/Shang_Dynasty \"Shang Dynasty\").[8]\nThe technology for bronze swords reached its high point during the Warring\nStates period and Qin Dynasty. Amongst the Warring States period swords, some\nunique technologies were used, such as casting high tin edges over softer,\nlower tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade\n(see [sword of Goujian](/wiki/Sword_of_Goujian \"Sword of Goujian\")). Also\nunique for Chinese bronzes is the consistent use of high tin bronze (17–21%\ntin) which is very hard and breaks if stressed too far, whereas other cultures\npreferred lower tin bronze (usually 10%), which bends if stressed too far.\nAlthough iron swords were made alongside bronze, it was not until the early\n[Han period](/wiki/Han_period \"Han period\") that iron completely replaced\nbronze.[9]\n\nIn South Asia earliest available [Bronze age swords](/wiki/Bronze_age_sword\n\"Bronze age sword\") of copper were discovered in the [Harappan](/wiki/Harappa\n\"Harappa\") sites, in present-day Pakistan, and date back to 2300 BC[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]. Swords\nhave been recovered in archaeological findings throughout the\n[Ganges](/wiki/Ganges \"Ganges\")-[Jamuna](/wiki/Jamuna_River_\\(Bangladesh\\)\n\"Jamuna River \\(Bangladesh\\)\") [Doab](/wiki/Doab \"Doab\") region of\n[India](/wiki/India \"India\"), consisting of [bronze](/wiki/Bronze \"Bronze\")\nbut more commonly [copper](/wiki/Copper \"Copper\").[10] Diverse specimens have\nbeen discovered in [Fatehgarh](/wiki/Fatehgarh \"Fatehgarh\"), where there are\nseveral varieties of hilt.[10] These swords have been variously dated to times\nbetween 1700–1400 BC, but were probably used more notably in the opening\ncenturies of the 1st millennium BC.[10]\n\n#### Iron Age[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Iron Age\")]\n\nMain article: [Iron Age sword](/wiki/Iron_Age_sword \"Iron Age sword\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Hallstatt_%27C%27_Swords_in_Wels_Museum%2C_Upper_Austria.jpg/170px-\nHallstatt_%27C%27_Swords_in_Wels_Museum%2C_Upper_Austria.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hallstatt_%27C%27_Swords_in_Wels_Museum,_Upper_Austria.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hallstatt_%27C%27_Swords_in_Wels_Museum,_Upper_Austria.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Hallstatt](/wiki/Hallstatt_culture \"Hallstatt culture\") swords\n\n[Iron](/wiki/Iron \"Iron\") became increasingly common from the 13th century\nB.C. Before that the use of swords was less frequent. The iron was not\n[quench-hardened](/wiki/Quenching \"Quenching\") although often containing\nsufficient carbon, but work-hardened like bronze by hammering. This made them\ncomparable or only slightly better in terms of strength and hardness to bronze\nswords. They could still bend during use rather than spring back into shape.\nBut the easier production, and the better availability of the raw material for\nthe first time permitted the equipment of entire armies with metal weapons,\nthough Bronze Age Egyptian armies were sometimes fully equipped with bronze\nweapons.[11]\n\nAncient swords are often found at burial sites. The sword was often placed on\nthe right side of the corpse. However, there are exceptions to this. A lot of\ntimes the sword was kept over the corpse. In many late [Iron\nAge](/wiki/Iron_Age \"Iron Age\") graves, the sword and the\n[scabbard](/wiki/Scabbard \"Scabbard\") were bent at 180 degrees. It was known\nas killing the sword. Thus they might have considered swords as the most\npotent and powerful object.[12]\n\n#### Greco-Roman\nantiquity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section:\nGreco-Roman antiquity\")]\n\nFurther information: [Migration period sword](/wiki/Migration_period_sword\n\"Migration period sword\")\n\nBy the time of [Classical Antiquity](/wiki/Classical_Antiquity \"Classical\nAntiquity\") and the [Parthian](/wiki/Parthian_Empire \"Parthian Empire\") and\n[Sassanid Empires](/wiki/Sasanian_Empire \"Sasanian Empire\") in Iran, iron\nswords were common. The Greek [xiphos](/wiki/Xiphos \"Xiphos\") and the Roman\n[gladius](/wiki/Gladius \"Gladius\") are typical examples of the type, measuring\nsome 60 to 70 cm (24 to 28 in).[13][14] The late [Roman\nEmpire](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman Empire\") introduced the longer\n[spatha](/wiki/Spatha \"Spatha\")[15] (the term for its wielder,\n[spatharius](/wiki/Spatharius \"Spatharius\"), became a court rank in\n[Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople \"Constantinople\")), and from this time,\nthe term _[longsword](/wiki/Longsword \"Longsword\")_ is applied to swords\ncomparatively long for their respective periods.[16]\n\nSwords from the Parthian and Sassanian Empires were quite long, the blades on\nsome late Sassanian swords being just under a metre long.\n\nSwords were also used to administer various [physical\npunishments](/wiki/Physical_punishment \"Physical punishment\"), such as non-\nsurgical [amputation](/wiki/Amputation \"Amputation\") or [capital\npunishment](/wiki/Capital_punishment \"Capital punishment\") by decapitation.\nThe use of a sword, an honourable weapon, was regarded in Europe since [Roman\ntimes](/wiki/Roman_Republic \"Roman Republic\") as a privilege reserved for the\n[nobility](/wiki/Nobility \"Nobility\") and the upper classes.[17]\n\nThe [Periplus of the Erythraean Sea](/wiki/Periplus_of_the_Erythraean_Sea\n\"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\") mentions swords of Indian iron and steel\nbeing exported from India to [Greece](/wiki/Greece \"Greece\").[18] [Sri\nLankan](/wiki/Sri_Lanka \"Sri Lanka\") and [Indian](/wiki/India \"India\") Blades\nmade of [Damascus steel](/wiki/Damascus_steel \"Damascus steel\") also found\ntheir way into [Persia](/wiki/Persia \"Persia\").[18]\n\n#### Persian antiquity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Persian antiquity\")]\n\nIn the first millennium BC the [Persian armies](/wiki/Military_history_of_Iran\n\"Military history of Iran\") used a sword that was originally of Scythian\ndesign called the akinaka ([acinaces](/wiki/Acinaces \"Acinaces\")). However,\nthe great conquests of the Persians made the sword more famous as a Persian\nweapon, to the extent that the true nature of the weapon has been lost\nsomewhat as the name Akinaka has been used to refer to whichever form of sword\nthe Persian army favoured at the time.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Darius-\nVase.jpg/170px-Darius-Vase.jpg)](/wiki/File:Darius-Vase.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Darius-Vase.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Darius I](/wiki/Darius_I \"Darius I\") of Persia holding an acinaces in his lap\n\nIt is widely believed that the original akinaka was a 14 to 18 inch double-\nedged sword. The design was not uniform and in fact identification is made\nmore on the nature of the [scabbard](/wiki/Scabbard \"Scabbard\") than the\nweapon itself; the scabbard usually has a large, decorative mount allowing it\nto be suspended from a belt on the wearer’s right side. Because of this, it is\nassumed that the sword was intended to be drawn with the blade pointing\ndownwards ready for surprise stabbing attacks.\n\nIn the 12th century, the [Seljuq dynasty](/wiki/Seljuq_dynasty \"Seljuq\ndynasty\") had introduced the curved [shamshir](/wiki/Shamshir \"Shamshir\") to\nPersia, and this was in extensive use by the early 16th century.\n\n#### Chinese antiquity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Chinese antiquity\")]\n\nChinese steel swords made their first appearance in the later part of the\n[Western Zhou Dynasty](/wiki/Western_Zhou_Dynasty \"Western Zhou Dynasty\"), but\nwere not widely used until the 3rd century BC [Han Dynasty](/wiki/Han_Dynasty\n\"Han Dynasty\").[9] The Chinese [Dao](/wiki/Dao_\\(sword\\) \"Dao \\(sword\\)\") (刀\n[pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin \"Pinyin\") dāo) is single-edged, sometimes translated as\n[sabre](/wiki/Sabre \"Sabre\") or [broadsword](/wiki/Broadsword \"Broadsword\"),\nand the [Jian](/wiki/Jian \"Jian\") (劍or剑 [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin \"Pinyin\") jiàn)\nis double-edged.

It was frequently used\nby men in [battle](/wiki/Battle \"Battle\"), particularly during an attack. The\n[spatha](/wiki/Spatha \"Spatha\") type remained popular throughout the\n[Migration period](/wiki/Migration_period \"Migration period\") and well into\nthe Middle Ages. [Vendel Age](/wiki/Vendel_Age \"Vendel Age\") spathas were\ndecorated with Germanic artwork (not unlike the Germanic\n[bracteates](/wiki/Bracteate \"Bracteate\") fashioned after Roman coins). The\n[Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age \"Viking Age\") saw again a more standardized\nproduction, but the basic design remained indebted to the spatha.[19]\n\nAround the 10th century, the use of properly quenched\n[hardened](/wiki/Hardened_steel \"Hardened steel\") and [tempered\nsteel](/wiki/Tempering_\\(metallurgy\\) \"Tempering \\(metallurgy\\)\") started to\nbecome much more common than in previous periods. The [Frankish](/wiki/Franks\n\"Franks\") '[Ulfberht](/wiki/Ulfberht_swords \"Ulfberht swords\")' blades (the\nname of the maker inlaid in the blade) were of particularly consistent high\nquality.[20] [Charles the Bald](/wiki/Charles_the_Bald \"Charles the Bald\")\ntried to prohibit the export of these swords, as they were used by\n[Vikings](/wiki/Vikings \"Vikings\") in raids against the [Franks](/wiki/Franks\n\"Franks\").\n\n[Wootz steel](/wiki/Wootz_steel \"Wootz steel\") which is also known as\n[Damascus steel](/wiki/Damascus_steel \"Damascus steel\") was a unique and\nhighly prized steel developed on the Indian subcontinent as early as the 5th\ncentury BC. Its properties were unique due to the special smelting and\nreworking of the steel creating networks of iron carbides described as a\nglobular [cementite](/wiki/Cementite \"Cementite\") in a matrix of\n[pearlite](/wiki/Pearlite \"Pearlite\"). The use of Damascus steel in swords\nbecame extremely popular in the 16th and 17th centuries.[nb 1][21]\n\nIt was only from the 11th century that [Norman](/wiki/Normans \"Normans\")\nswords began to develop the [crossguard](/wiki/Crossguard \"Crossguard\")\n(quillons). During the [Crusades](/wiki/Crusades \"Crusades\") of the 12th to\n13th century, this [cruciform](/wiki/Cruciform#Cruciform_sword \"Cruciform\")\ntype of [arming sword](/wiki/Arming_sword \"Arming sword\") remained essentially\nstable, with variations mainly concerning the shape of the\n[pommel](/wiki/Hilt#Pommel \"Hilt\"). These swords were designed as cutting\nweapons, although effective points were becoming common to counter\nimprovements in armour, especially the 14th-century change from\n[mail](/wiki/Mail_\\(armour\\) \"Mail \\(armour\\)\") to [plate\narmour](/wiki/Plate_armour \"Plate armour\").[22]\n\nIt was during the 14th century, with the growing use of more advanced armour,\nthat the hand and a half sword, also known as a \"[bastard\nsword](/wiki/Classification_of_swords#Longsword_and_bastard_sword\n\"Classification of swords\")\", came into being. It had an extended grip that\nmeant it could be used with either one or two hands. Though these swords did\nnot provide a full two-hand grip they allowed their wielders to hold a\n[shield](/wiki/Shield \"Shield\") or parrying dagger in their off hand, or to\nuse it as a two-handed sword for a more powerful blow.[23]\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the sword was often used as a symbol of the [word of\nGod](/wiki/Logos_\\(Christianity\\) \"Logos \\(Christianity\\)\").

The main\ntransition was the lengthening of the grip, allowing [two-\nhanded](/wiki/Classification_of_swords#Handedness \"Classification of swords\")\nuse, and a longer blade. By 1400, this type of sword, at the time called\n_[langes Schwert](/wiki/Longsword \"Longsword\")_ (longsword) or _spadone_ , was\ncommon, and a number of 15th- and 16th-century _[Fechtbücher](/wiki/Fechtbuch\n\"Fechtbuch\")_ offering instructions on their use survive.

Many of these are now readily available online.[45][46]\n\nIn the 16th century, the large [zweihänder](/wiki/Zweih%C3%A4nder\n\"Zweihänder\") was used by the elite German and Swiss mercenaries known as\n[doppelsöldners](/wiki/Doppels%C3%B6ldner \"Doppelsöldner\").[47] Zweihänder,\nliterally translated, means two-hander. The zweihänder possesses a long blade,\nas well as a huge guard for protection. It is estimated that some zweihänder\nswords were over 6 feet (1.8 m) long, with the one ascribed to\n[Frisian](/wiki/Frisia \"Frisia\") warrior [Pier Gerlofs\nDonia](/wiki/Pier_Gerlofs_Donia \"Pier Gerlofs Donia\") being 7 feet (2.13 m)\nlong.[48] The gigantic blade length was perfectly designed for manipulating\nand pushing away enemy [pole-arms](/wiki/Pole_weapon \"Pole weapon\"), which\nwere major weapons around this time, in both Germany and Eastern Europe.\nDoppelsöldners also used [katzbalgers](/wiki/Katzbalger \"Katzbalger\"), which\nmeans 'cat-gutter'. The katzbalger's S-shaped guard and 2-foot-long (0.61 m)\nblade made it perfect for bringing in when the fighting became too close to\nuse a zweihänder.[49]\n\nCivilian use of swords became increasingly common during the late Renaissance,\nwith [duels](/wiki/Duels \"Duels\") being a preferred way to honourably settle\ndisputes. The practice of civilian duelling, with specifically designed\ncivilian swords such as the Italian [Cinquedea](/wiki/Cinquedea \"Cinquedea\")\nand Swiss [Baselard](/wiki/Baselard \"Baselard\"), became so popular that\naccording to one scholar: \"In France during the reign of [Henry\nIV](/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France \"Henry IV of France\") (1589–1610), more than\n4,000 French aristocrats were killed in duels in an eighteen-year\nperiod...During the reign of [Louis XIII](/wiki/Louis_XIII_of_France \"Louis\nXIII of France\") (1610–1643)...in a twenty-year period 8,000\n[pardons](/wiki/Pardons \"Pardons\") were issued for [murders](/wiki/Murders\n\"Murders\") associated with duels.\"[50]\n\nThe [side-sword](/wiki/Side-sword \"Side-sword\") was a type of war sword used\nby infantry during the [Renaissance](/wiki/Renaissance \"Renaissance\") of\n[Europe](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\"). This sword was a direct descendant of the\n[arming sword](/wiki/Arming_sword \"Arming sword\"). Quite popular between the\n16th and 17th centuries, they were ideal for handling the mix of armoured and\nunarmoured opponents of that time. A new technique of placing one's finger on\nthe [ricasso](/wiki/Ricasso \"Ricasso\") to improve the grip (a practice that\nwould continue in the [rapier](/wiki/Rapier \"Rapier\")) led to the production\nof hilts with a guard for the finger. This sword design eventually led to the\ndevelopment of the civilian [rapier](/wiki/Rapier \"Rapier\"), but it was not\nreplaced by it, and the side-sword continued to be used during the rapier's\nlifetime. As it could be used for both cutting and thrusting, the term [cut\nand thrust sword](/wiki/Spada_da_lato \"Spada da lato\") is sometimes used\ninterchangeably with side-sword.[51] Also of note is that as rapiers became\nmore popular, attempts were made to hybridize the blade, sacrificing the\neffectiveness found in each unique weapon design. These are still considered\nside-swords and are sometimes labeled _sword rapier_ or _cutting rapier_ by\nmodern collectors.\n\nAlso of note, side-swords used in conjunction with [bucklers](/wiki/Buckler\n\"Buckler\") became so popular that it caused the term\n[swashbuckler](/wiki/Swashbuckler \"Swashbuckler\") to be coined. This word\nstems from the new fighting style of the side-sword and buckler which was\nfilled with much \"swashing and making a noise on the buckler\".[52]\n\nWithin the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman Empire\"), the use of\na curved sabre called the [Yatagan](/wiki/Yatagan \"Yatagan\") started in the\nmid-16th century. It would become the weapon of choice for many in\n[Turkey](/wiki/Turkey \"Turkey\") and the [Balkans](/wiki/Balkans\n\"Balkans\").[53]\n\nThe sword in this time period was the most personal weapon, the most\nprestigious, and the most versatile for close combat, but it came to decline\nin military use as technology, such as the [crossbow](/wiki/Crossbow\n\"Crossbow\") and [firearms](/wiki/Firearms \"Firearms\") changed warfare.\nHowever, it maintained a key role in civilian [self-defence](/wiki/Self-\ndefence \"Self-defence\").[54]\n\n### Early Modern period[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Early Modern period\")]\n\n#### Military sword[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Military sword\")]\n\nFurther information: [Basket-hilted sword](/wiki/Basket-hilted_sword \"Basket-\nhilted sword\"), [Backsword](/wiki/Backsword \"Backsword\"), and\n[Sabre](/wiki/Sabre \"Sabre\")\n\nA single-edged type of [sidearm](/wiki/Side_arm \"Side arm\") used by the\n[Hussites](/wiki/Hussites \"Hussites\") was popularized in 16th-century Germany\nunder its Czech name _[Dusack](/wiki/Dusack \"Dusack\")_ , also known as _Säbel\nauf Teutsch gefasst_ (\"sabre fitted in the German manner\").[55] A closely\nrelated weapon is the _schnepf_ or [Swiss sabre](/wiki/Swiss_sabre \"Swiss\nsabre\") used in [Early Modern Switzerland](/wiki/Early_Modern_Switzerland\n\"Early Modern Switzerland\").[56]\n\nThe [cut-and-thrust](/wiki/Cut-and-thrust \"Cut-and-thrust\") [mortuary\nsword](/wiki/Mortuary_sword \"Mortuary sword\") was used after 1625 by\n[cavalry](/wiki/Cavalry \"Cavalry\") during the [English Civil\nWar](/wiki/English_Civil_War \"English Civil War\").

The so-called [walloon\nsword](/wiki/Walloon_sword \"Walloon sword\") (_épée wallone_)[57] was common in\nthe [Thirty Years' War](/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War \"Thirty Years' War\") and\n[Baroque](/wiki/Baroque \"Baroque\") era.[58] Its hilt was ambidextrous with\nshell-guards and [knuckle-bow](/wiki/Knuckle-bow \"Knuckle-bow\") that inspired\n18th century continental [hunting hangers](/wiki/Hunting_hanger \"Hunting\nhanger\").[59] Following their campaign in the Netherlands in 1672, the French\nbegan producing this weapon as their first regulation sword.[60] Weapons of\nthis design were also issued to the [Swedish army](/wiki/Swedish_army \"Swedish\narmy\") from the time of [Gustavus Adolphus](/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus \"Gustavus\nAdolphus\") until as late as the 1850s.[61]\n\n#### Duelling sword[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Duelling sword\")]\n\nFurther information: [Rapier](/wiki/Rapier \"Rapier\") and\n[Smallsword](/wiki/Smallsword \"Smallsword\")\n\nThe [rapier](/wiki/Rapier \"Rapier\") is believed to have evolved either from\nthe Spanish _[espada ropera](/wiki/Espada_ropera \"Espada ropera\")_ or from the\nswords of the [Italian nobility](/wiki/Nobility_of_Italy \"Nobility of Italy\")\nsomewhere in the later part of the 16th century.[62][63] The rapier differed\nfrom most earlier swords in that it was not a military weapon but a primarily\ncivilian sword. Both the rapier and the Italian [schiavona](/wiki/Schiavona\n\"Schiavona\") developed the crossguard into a [basket-shaped\nguard](/wiki/Basket-hilted_sword \"Basket-hilted sword\") for hand\nprotection.[64] During the 17th and 18th centuries, the shorter\n[smallsword](/wiki/Smallsword \"Smallsword\") became an essential fashion\naccessory in European countries and the New World, though in some places such\nas the [Scottish Highlands](/wiki/Scottish_Highlands \"Scottish Highlands\")\nlarge swords as the basket-hilted broadsword were preferred, and most wealthy\nmen and military officers carried one slung from a belt. Both the smallsword\nand the rapier remained popular [dueling swords](/wiki/European_dueling_sword\n\"European dueling sword\") well into the 18th century.[65]\n\nAs the wearing of swords fell out of fashion,\n[canes](/wiki/Walking_stick_\\(device\\) \"Walking stick \\(device\\)\") took their\nplace in a gentleman's wardrobe.

The [French](/wiki/France\n\"France\") [martial art](/wiki/Martial_art \"Martial art\") _[la\ncanne](/wiki/La_canne \"La canne\")_ developed to fight with canes and\nswordsticks and has now evolved into a sport. The English martial art\n[singlestick](/wiki/Singlestick \"Singlestick\") is very similar. With the rise\nof the [pistol duel](/wiki/Duelling_pistol \"Duelling pistol\"), the duelling\nsword fell out of fashion long before the practice of duelling itself. By\nabout 1770, English duelists enthusiastically adopted the pistol, and sword\nduels dwindled.[66] However, the custom of duelling with\n[epées](/wiki/Ep%C3%A9e \"Epée\") persisted well into the 20th century in\nFrance.

On mobilization in August 1914 all serving\nBritish Army officers were required to have their swords sharpened as the only\npeacetime use of the weapon had been for saluting on parade.[71] The high\nvisibility and limited practical use of the sword however led to it being\nabandoned within weeks, although most cavalry continued to carry sabres\nthroughout the War.

The Japanese katana, wakizashi and tanto are\ncarried by some infantry and officers in Japan and other parts of Asia and the\n[kukri](/wiki/Kukri \"Kukri\") is the official melee weapon for\n[Nepal](/wiki/Nepal \"Nepal\").

This style is often referred to as a \"narrow\" or \"hidden\" tang. Modern, less traditional, replicas often feature a threaded pommel or a pommel nut which holds the hilt together and allows dismantling.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n  * In a \"full\" tang (most commonly used in knives and [machetes](/wiki/Machete \"Machete\")), the tang has about the same width as the blade, and is generally the same shape as the grip.[78] In European or Asian swords sold today, many advertised \"full\" tangs may actually involve a forged rat-tail tang.\n\n## Morphology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit\nsection: Morphology\")]\n\nFurther information: [Classification of swords](/wiki/Classification_of_swords\n\"Classification of swords\")\n\nThe sword consists of the [blade](/wiki/Blade \"Blade\") and the\n[hilt](/wiki/Hilt \"Hilt\"). The term _[scabbard](/wiki/Scabbard \"Scabbard\")_\napplies to the cover for the sword blade when not in use.\n\n### Blade[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit\nsection: Blade\")]\n\nMain articles: [Sword blade](/wiki/Sword_blade \"Sword blade\") and [Oakeshott\ntypology](/wiki/Oakeshott_typology \"Oakeshott typology\")\n\n[![Sword parts-\nen.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Sword_parts-\nen.svg/512px-Sword_parts-en.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Sword_parts-en.svg)\n\nThere is considerable variation in the detailed design of sword blades. The\ndiagram opposite shows a typical Medieval European sword.\n\nEarly iron blades have rounded points due to the limited metallurgy of the\ntime. These were still effective for thrusting against lightly armoured\nopponents. As armour advanced, blades were made narrower, stiffer and sharply\npointed to defeat the armour by thrusting.\n\nDedicated cutting blades are wide and thin, and often have grooves known as\n[fullers](/wiki/Fuller_\\(weapon\\) \"Fuller \\(weapon\\)\") which lighten the blade\nat the cost of some of the blade's stiffness. The edges of a cutting sword are\nalmost parallel. Blades oriented for the thrust have thicker blades, sometimes\nwith a distinct midrib for increased stiffness, with a strong taper and an\nacute point. The geometry of a cutting sword blade allows for acute edge\nangles. It should be noted, however, that an edge with an acuter angle is more\ninclined to degrade quickly in combat situations than an edge with a more\nobtuse angle. Also, an acute edge angle is not the primary factor of a blade's\nsharpness.[79]\n\nThe part of the blade between the [center of\npercussion](/wiki/Center_of_percussion \"Center of percussion\") (CoP) and the\npoint is called the _foible_ (weak) of the blade, and that between the [center\nof balance](/wiki/Center_of_gravity \"Center of gravity\") (CoB) and the hilt is\nthe _forte_ (strong). The section in between the CoP and the CoB is the\n_middle_.\n\nThe _[ricasso](/wiki/Ricasso \"Ricasso\")_ or _shoulder_ identifies a short\nsection of blade immediately below the guard that is left completely\nunsharpened. Many swords have no ricasso. On some large weapons, such as the\n[German](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\") _[Zweihänder](/wiki/Zweih%C3%A4nder\n\"Zweihänder\")_ , a metal cover surrounded the ricasso, and a swordsman might\ngrip it in one hand to wield the weapon more easily in close-quarter\ncombat.[49] The ricasso normally bears the [maker's mark](/wiki/Trademark\n\"Trademark\").\n\nThe [tang](/wiki/Tang_\\(tools\\) \"Tang \\(tools\\)\") is the extension of the\nblade to which the hilt is fitted.\n\nOn Japanese blades, the maker's mark appears on the tang under the grip.[80]\n\n### Hilt[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit section:\nHilt\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Rapier_mg_3370-no_shadows.jpg/170px-\nRapier_mg_3370-no_shadows.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rapier_mg_3370-no_shadows.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rapier_mg_3370-no_shadows.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nHilt of a [rapier](/wiki/Rapier \"Rapier\").

The pommel was originally designed as a stop to prevent the\nsword slipping from the hand. From around the 11th century onward it became a\ncounterbalance to the blade, allowing a more fluid style of\nfighting.[_[dubious](/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement\n\"Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute\") – [discuss](/wiki/Talk:Sword#Dubious\n\"Talk:Sword\")_][81] It can also be used as a blunt instrument at close range,\nand its weight affects the centre of percussion. In later times a _[sword\nknot](/wiki/Hilt#Sword_knot \"Hilt\")_ or _[tassel](/wiki/Hilt#Sword_knot\n\"Hilt\")_ was sometimes added. By the 17th century, with the growing use of\nfirearms and the accompanying decline in the use of [armour](/wiki/Armour\n\"Armour\"), many [rapiers](/wiki/Rapier \"Rapier\") and [dueling\nswords](/wiki/European_dueling_sword \"European dueling sword\") had developed\nelaborate basket hilts, which protect the palm of the wielder and rendered the\n[gauntlet](/wiki/Gauntlet_\\(glove\\) \"Gauntlet \\(glove\\)\") obsolete.[82]\n\nIn late medieval and Renaissance era European swords, a flap of leather called\nthe _chappe_ or _rain guard_ was attached to a sword's\n[crossguard](/wiki/Crossguard \"Crossguard\") at the base of the hilt to protect\nthe mouth of the scabbard and prevent water from entering.[83]\n\n### Sword scabbards and\nsuspension[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sword&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit\nsection: Sword scabbards and suspension\")]\n\nMain article: [Scabbard](/wiki/Scabbard \"Scabbard\")\n\nCommon accessories to the sword include the [scabbard](/wiki/Scabbard\n\"Scabbard\"), as well as the _sword belt_.\n\n  * **Scabbard** : The scabbard, also known as the **sheath** , is a protective cover often provided for the sword blade. Over the millennia, scabbards have been made of many materials, including leather, wood, and metals such as brass or steel. The metal fitting where the blade enters the leather or metal scabbard is called the **throat** , which is often part of a larger scabbard **mount** , or **locket** , that bears a carrying ring or stud to facilitate wearing the sword. The blade's point in leather scabbards is usually protected by a metal **tip** , or [chape](/wiki/Chape \"Chape\"), which on both leather and metal scabbards is often given further protection from wear by an extension called a **drag** , or **shoe**.[84]\n  * **Sword belt** : A sword belt is a [belt](/wiki/Belt_\\(clothing\\) \"Belt \\(clothing\\)\") with an attachment for the sword's scabbard, used to carry it when not in use. It is usually fixed to the scabbard of the sword, providing a fast means of drawing the sword in battle.
