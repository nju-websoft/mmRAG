Unbeknownst to them, the [Dark\nLord Sauron](/wiki/Sauron \"Sauron\") forges the [One Ring](/wiki/One_Ring \"One\nRing\") in [Mount Doom](/wiki/Mount_Doom \"Mount Doom\"), infusing into it a\ngreat part of his power to dominate, through it and at a distance, the other\nRings, so he might conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of men and elves\nbattles Sauron’s forces in [Mordor](/wiki/Mordor \"Mordor\"), where Prince\n[Isildur](/wiki/Isildur \"Isildur\") of [Gondor](/wiki/Gondor \"Gondor\") severs\nSauron's finger, and the Ring with it, thereby destroying his physical form.\nWith Sauron's first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins.\nUnfortunately, the Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, and, rather than destroy\nthe Ring, Isildur takes it for himself. Isildur is later killed by\n[Orcs](/wiki/Orc_\\(Middle-earth\\) \"Orc \\(Middle-earth\\)\"), and the Ring is\nlost for 2,500 years, until it is found by [Gollum](/wiki/Gollum \"Gollum\"),\nwho owns it for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a\n[Hobbit](/wiki/Hobbit \"Hobbit\") named [Bilbo Baggins](/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins\n\"Bilbo Baggins\").\n\nSixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the\n[Shire](/wiki/Shire_\\(Middle-earth\\) \"Shire \\(Middle-earth\\)\"), reuniting with\nhis old friend, [Gandalf the Grey](/wiki/Gandalf \"Gandalf\"). Bilbo reveals\nthat he intends to leave the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his\ninheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew, [Frodo](/wiki/Frodo_Baggins\n\"Frodo Baggins\"). Although Bilbo has begun to become corrupted by the Ring and\ntries to keep it for himself, Gandalf intervenes. Gandalf, suspicious of the\nRing, tells Frodo to keep it secret and to keep it safe. Gandalf then\ninvestigates the Ring, discovers its true identity, and returns to warn Frodo.\nGandalf also learns that Gollum was tortured by Orcs, and that Gollum uttered\ntwo words during his torture: \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf instructs Frodo\nto leave the Shire, accompanied by his gardener [Samwise\nGamgee](/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee \"Samwise Gamgee\"). Gandalf rides to\n[Isengard](/wiki/Isengard \"Isengard\") to meet with fellow wizard\n[Saruman](/wiki/Saruman \"Saruman\") the White, but learns that he has joined\nforces with Sauron, who has unleashed the [Ringwraiths](/wiki/Ringwraith\n\"Ringwraith\") to find Frodo. After a brief battle, Saruman imprisons Gandalf.\nFrodo and Sam are joined by fellow Hobbits, [Merry](/wiki/Meriadoc_Brandybuck\n\"Meriadoc Brandybuck\") and [Pippin](/wiki/Peregrin_Took \"Peregrin Took\"), and\nthey evade the Ringwraiths, arriving in [Bree](/wiki/Bree_\\(Middle-earth\\)\n\"Bree \\(Middle-earth\\)\"), where they are meant to meet Gandalf. However,\nGandalf never arrived, and they are instead aided by a ranger named\n[Strider](/wiki/Aragorn \"Aragorn\"), a friend of Gandalf's, who escorts them to\n[Rivendell](/wiki/Rivendell \"Rivendell\").\n\nThe Hobbits are ambushed by the Ringwraiths, and one stabs Frodo with a cursed\n[Morgul blade](/wiki/Morgul_blade \"Morgul blade\"). [Arwen](/wiki/Arwen\n\"Arwen\"), an elf and Strider’s lover, comes to Frodo’s aid and successfully\ntakes him to Rivendell, where he is healed. Frodo meets Gandalf, who escaped\nIsengard on the back of a giant [Eagle](/wiki/Eagle_\\(Middle-earth\\) \"Eagle\n\\(Middle-earth\\)\"). Arwen’s father, [Lord Elrond,](/wiki/Elrond \"Elrond\")\nholds a council that decides the Ring must be destroyed in Mount Doom. While\nthe members argue, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf,\nSam, Merry, Pippin, elf [Legolas](/wiki/Legolas \"Legolas\"), dwarf\n[Gimli](/wiki/Gimli_\\(Middle-earth\\) \"Gimli \\(Middle-earth\\)\"),\n[Boromir](/wiki/Boromir \"Boromir\") of Gondor, and Strider, who is revealed to\nbe Aragorn, Isildur’s heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo gives Frodo\nhis sword, Sting. The Fellowship of the Ring sets off, but Saruman’s magic\nforces them to travel through the Mines of [Moria](/wiki/Moria_\\(Middle-\nearth\\) \"Moria \\(Middle-earth\\)\"), much to Gandalf's displeasure.\n\nThe Fellowship discovers that the dwarves within Moria have been slain, and\nthey are attacked by Orcs and a cave [troll](/wiki/Troll \"Troll\"). They defeat\nthem, but are confronted by an ancient demon called a [Balrog](/wiki/Balrog\n\"Balrog\"). Gandalf casts the Balrog into a vast chasm, but it drags Gandalf\ndown into the darkness with it. The rest of the Fellowship, now commanded by\nAragorn, reaches [Lothlórien](/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien \"Lothlórien\"), home to\nelves [Galadriel](/wiki/Galadriel \"Galadriel\") and [Celeborn](/wiki/Celeborn\n\"Celeborn\"). Galadriel privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the\nquest, and that one of his friends will try to take the Ring. Meanwhile,\nSaruman creates an army of [Uruk-hai](/wiki/Uruk-hai \"Uruk-hai\") to track down\nand kill the Fellowship.\n\nThe Fellowship leaves Lothlórien by river to [Parth Galen](/wiki/Parth_Galen\n\"Parth Galen\"). Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who tries to\ntake the Ring in desperation. Afraid of the Ring corrupting his friends, Frodo\ndecides to travel to Mordor alone. The Fellowship is then ambushed by the\nUruk-hai. Merry and Pippin are taken captive, and Boromir is mortally wounded\nby the Uruk chieftain. After slaying the chieftain, Aragorn watches Boromir\ndie peacefully. Sam follows Frodo, accompanying him to keep his promise to\nGandalf to protect Frodo, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go to rescue Merry\nand Pippin.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\nFurther information: [Cast of The Lord of the Rings film\nseries](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_\\(film_series\\)#Cast \"The Lord of the\nRings \\(film series\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/Fellowship.JPG)](/wiki/File:Fellowship.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Fellowship.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe eponymous Fellowship of the Ring, from left to right: (Top row) Aragorn,\nGandalf, Legolas, Boromir, (bottom row) Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gimli.\n\nBefore filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six\nweeks in sword fighting (with [Bob Anderson](/wiki/Bob_Anderson_\\(fencer\\)\n\"Bob Anderson \\(fencer\\)\")), riding and boating. Jackson hoped such activities\nwould allow the cast to bond so chemistry would be evident on screen as well\nas getting them used to life in [Wellington](/wiki/Wellington\n\"Wellington\").[8] They were also trained to pronounce Tolkien's verses\nproperly.[9] After the shoot, the nine cast members playing the Fellowship got\na tattoo of the English word \"nine\" written in [Tengwar](/wiki/Tengwar\n\"Tengwar\"), with the exception of [John Rhys-Davies](/wiki/John_Rhys-Davies\n\"John Rhys-Davies\"), whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[10] The film\nis noted for having an [ensemble cast](/wiki/Ensemble_cast \"Ensemble\ncast\"),[11] and some of the cast and their respective characters include:\n\n  * [Elijah Wood](/wiki/Elijah_Wood \"Elijah Wood\") as [Frodo Baggins](/wiki/Frodo_Baggins \"Frodo Baggins\"): a young [hobbit](/wiki/Hobbit \"Hobbit\") who inherits the [One Ring](/wiki/One_Ring \"One Ring\") from his uncle Bilbo. Wood was the first actor to be cast on 7 July 1999.[12] Wood was a fan of the book, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[13] Wood was selected from 150 actors who auditioned,[14] including [Jake Gyllenhaal](/wiki/Jake_Gyllenhaal \"Jake Gyllenhaal\").[15]\n  * [Ian McKellen](/wiki/Ian_McKellen \"Ian McKellen\") as [Gandalf the Grey](/wiki/Gandalf \"Gandalf\"): an [Istari wizard](/wiki/Wizard_\\(Middle-earth\\) \"Wizard \\(Middle-earth\\)\") and mentor to Frodo. [Sean Connery](/wiki/Sean_Connery \"Sean Connery\") was approached for the role, but did not understand the plot,[13] while [Patrick Stewart](/wiki/Patrick_Stewart \"Patrick Stewart\") turned it down as he disliked the script.[16] Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with [20th Century Fox](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox \"20th Century Fox\") as there was a two-month overlap with _[X-Men](/wiki/X-Men_\\(film\\) \"X-Men \\(film\\)\")_.[14] He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films,[10] and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.[8]\n  * [Sean Astin](/wiki/Sean_Astin \"Sean Astin\") as [Samwise \"Sam\" Gamgee](/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee \"Samwise Gamgee\"): a hobbit gardener and Frodo's best friend. Astin, who had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored Sam's relationship with Frodo.[8]\n  * [Viggo Mortensen](/wiki/Viggo_Mortensen \"Viggo Mortensen\") as [Aragorn II Elessar](/wiki/Aragorn \"Aragorn\"): a [Dúnedain](/wiki/D%C3%BAnedain \"Dúnedain\") [ranger](/wiki/Ranger_\\(Middle-earth\\) \"Ranger \\(Middle-earth\\)\"), the descendant of Isildur, and heir to [Gondor](/wiki/Gondor \"Gondor\")'s throne. [Daniel Day-Lewis](/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis \"Daniel Day-Lewis\") was offered the part at the beginning of pre-production, but turned it down.[17] [Nicolas Cage](/wiki/Nicolas_Cage \"Nicolas Cage\") also received an offer, declining because of \"family obligations\",[18] while [Vin Diesel](/wiki/Vin_Diesel \"Vin Diesel\"), a fan of the book, auditioned for Aragorn. [Stuart Townsend](/wiki/Stuart_Townsend \"Stuart Townsend\") was cast in the role, before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young.[13] [Russell Crowe](/wiki/Russell_Crowe \"Russell Crowe\") was considered as a replacement, but he turned it down after taking what he thought to be a similar role in _[Gladiator](/wiki/Gladiator_\\(2000_film\\) \"Gladiator \\(2000 film\\)\")_.[13] Day-Lewis was offered the role for a second time, but declined again.[17] Executive Producer [Mark Ordesky](/wiki/Mark_Ordesky \"Mark Ordesky\") saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role.[8] Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop.[19] Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume[20] and carrying his \"hero\" sword around with him off-camera.[8]\n  * [Billy Boyd](/wiki/Billy_Boyd_\\(actor\\) \"Billy Boyd \\(actor\\)\") as [Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took](/wiki/Peregrin_Took \"Peregrin Took\"): a hobbit who travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.\n  * [Dominic Monaghan](/wiki/Dominic_Monaghan \"Dominic Monaghan\") as [Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck](/wiki/Meriadoc_Brandybuck \"Meriadoc Brandybuck\"): a distant cousin of Frodo.

[Billy Connolly](/wiki/Billy_Connolly \"Billy Connolly\"), who was considered for the part of Gimli, later portrayed [Dáin II Ironfoot](/wiki/D%C3%A1in_II_Ironfoot \"Dáin II Ironfoot\") in [Peter Jackson](/wiki/Peter_Jackson \"Peter Jackson\")'s [_The Hobbit_ film trilogy](/wiki/The_Hobbit_\\(film_series\\) \"The Hobbit \\(film series\\)\").[13] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually developed [eczema](/wiki/Eczema \"Eczema\") around his eyes.[8]\n  * [Orlando Bloom](/wiki/Orlando_Bloom \"Orlando Bloom\") as [Legolas Greenleaf](/wiki/Legolas \"Legolas\"): a prince of the elves' [Woodland Realm](/wiki/Mirkwood \"Mirkwood\") and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for [Faramir](/wiki/Faramir \"Faramir\"), who appears in the second film, a role which went to [David Wenham](/wiki/David_Wenham \"David Wenham\").[13]\n  * [Sean Bean](/wiki/Sean_Bean \"Sean Bean\") as [Boromir](/wiki/Boromir \"Boromir\"): a prince of the [Stewards of Gondor](/wiki/Stewards_of_Gondor \"Stewards of Gondor\") who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor. [Bruce Willis](/wiki/Bruce_Willis \"Bruce Willis\"), a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while [Liam Neeson](/wiki/Liam_Neeson \"Liam Neeson\") was sent the script, but passed.[13]\n  * [Ian Holm](/wiki/Ian_Holm \"Ian Holm\") as [Bilbo Baggins](/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins \"Bilbo Baggins\"): Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a [1981 radio adaption of _The Lord of the Rings_](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_\\(1981_radio_series\\) \"The Lord of the Rings \\(1981 radio series\\)\"), and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[13] [Sylvester McCoy](/wiki/Sylvester_McCoy \"Sylvester McCoy\"), who would later play Radagast the Brown in _[The Hobbit](/wiki/The_Hobbit_\\(film_series\\) \"The Hobbit \\(film series\\)\")_ , was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[21]\n  * [Liv Tyler](/wiki/Liv_Tyler \"Liv Tyler\") as [Arwen Undomiel](/wiki/Arwen \"Arwen\"): a beautiful [half-elf](/wiki/Elf_\\(Middle-earth\\) \"Elf \\(Middle-earth\\)\") princess of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in _[Plunkett& Macleane](/wiki/Plunkett_%26_Macleane \"Plunkett & Macleane\")_, and [New Line Cinema](/wiki/New_Line_Cinema \"New Line Cinema\") leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress [Helena Bonham Carter](/wiki/Helena_Bonham_Carter \"Helena Bonham Carter\") had expressed interest in the role.[13] Peter Jackson wanted to cast [Uma Thurman](/wiki/Uma_Thurman \"Uma Thurman\") as Arwen, but Thurman pulled out due to pregnancy, Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999.[22]\n  * [Cate Blanchett](/wiki/Cate_Blanchett \"Cate Blanchett\") as [Galadriel](/wiki/Galadriel \"Galadriel\"): the elven co-ruler of [Lothlórien](/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien \"Lothlórien\") alongside her husband Celeborn. Peter Jackson wanted to cast [Lucy Lawless](/wiki/Lucy_Lawless \"Lucy Lawless\") as Galadriel, but she declined due to pregnancy.[23]\n  * [Christopher Lee](/wiki/Christopher_Lee \"Christopher Lee\") as [Saruman the White](/wiki/Saruman \"Saruman\"): the fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will through his use of the _[palantír](/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr \"Palantír\")_. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also met [J. R. R. Tolkien](/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien \"J. R. R. Tolkien\").[19] He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.[13]\n  * [Hugo Weaving](/wiki/Hugo_Weaving \"Hugo Weaving\") as [Elrond](/wiki/Elrond \"Elrond\"): the elven Lord of Rivendell who leads the [Council of Elrond](/wiki/Council_of_Elrond \"Council of Elrond\"), which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring.

Jackson said his main desire was to make a\nfilm focused primarily on Frodo and the Ring, the \"backbone\" of the story.[24]\nThe prologue condenses Tolkien's backstory, in which The Last Alliance's\nseven-year siege of the [Barad-dûr](/wiki/Barad-d%C3%BBr \"Barad-dûr\") is a\nsingle battle, where Sauron is shown to explode, though Tolkien only said his\nspirit flees.[25]\n\nEvents from the book are condensed or omitted altogether at the beginning of\nthe film. The time between Gandalf leaving the Ring to Frodo and returning to\nreveal its inscription, which is 17 years in the book, is compressed for\ntiming reasons.[26] Frodo also spends a few months preparing to move to\nBuckland, on the eastern border of the Shire. This move is omitted, and\nassociated events, including the involvement of Merry and Pippin, are changed\nand combined with him setting out for Bree. Characters such as [Tom\nBombadil](/wiki/Tom_Bombadil \"Tom Bombadil\") and the incidents in the Old\nForest and the Barrow Downs are left out to simplify the plot and increase the\nthreat of the [Ringwraiths](/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl \"Nazgûl\"). Such sequences are\nleft out to make time to introduce Saruman, who doesn't appear in the book\nuntil Gandalf's account at the Council of Elrond. While some characters are\nleft out, some are referenced such as Tom, Bert, and William to show how _The\nHobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_ series intertwine. Saruman's role is\nenhanced: he is to blame for the blizzard on Caradhras, a role taken from\nSauron and/or Caradhras itself in the book. Gandalf's capture by Saruman is\nalso expanded with a fight sequence.\n\nThe role of [Barliman Butterbur](/wiki/Barliman_Butterbur \"Barliman\nButterbur\") at the Prancing Pony is largely removed for time and dramatic\nflow. In the film Pippin is seen to identify Frodo explicitly with the phrase\n\"why there's Baggins over there\" whereas in the book Pippin is only telling\nthe tale of Bilbo's disappearance when Strider tells Frodo to create a\ndistraction, which he does by singing a song.\n\nThe events at Weathertop were also altered. The location of the fight against\nthe Ringwraiths was changed to the ruins on top of the hill rather than a\ncampsite at its base. When Frodo was stabbed in the book, the party spent two\nweeks travelling to Rivendell, but in the film this is shortened to less than\na week, with Frodo's condition worsening at a commensurately greater rate.\n[Arwen](/wiki/Arwen \"Arwen\") was given a greater role in the film,\naccompanying Frodo all the way to Rivendell, while in the book Frodo faced the\nRingwraiths alone at the [Ford of Bruinen](/wiki/Bruinen \"Bruinen\"). The\ncharacter of [Glorfindel](/wiki/Glorfindel \"Glorfindel\") was omitted entirely\nand his scenes were also given to Arwen. She was tacitly credited with the\nriver rising against the Ringwraiths, which was the work of her father\n[Elrond](/wiki/Elrond \"Elrond\") with aid from [Gandalf](/wiki/Gandalf\n\"Gandalf\") in the book.\n\nA significant new addition is Aragorn's self-doubt, which causes him to\nhesitate to claim the kingship of Gondor. This element is not present in the\nbook, where Aragorn intends to claim the throne at an appropriate time. In the\nbook Narsil is reforged immediately when he joins the Fellowship, but this\nevent is held over until _[Return of the\nKing](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King \"The Lord of the\nRings: The Return of the King\")_ in film to symbolically coincide with his\nacceptance of his title. These elements were added because Peter Jackson\nbelieved that each character should be forced to grow or change over the\ncourse of the story.\n\n[Elrond](/wiki/Elrond \"Elrond\")'s character gained an adversarial edge; he\nexpresses doubts in the strength of Men to resist Sauron's evil after\nIsildur's failure to destroy the ring as depicted in the prologue. Jackson\nalso shortens the Council of Elrond by spreading its exposition into earlier\nparts of the film. Elrond's counsellor, [Erestor](/wiki/Erestor \"Erestor\")—who\nsuggested the Ring be given to [Tom Bombadil](/wiki/Tom_Bombadil \"Tom\nBombadil\")—was completely absent from this scene. Gimli's father,\n[Glóin](/wiki/Gl%C3%B3in \"Glóin\"), was also deemed unnecessary. In addition,\nthe movie makes it seem by chance that the Fellowship is made of nine\ncompanions, whereas in the book Elrond suggests there be nine in the\nfellowship in response to the nine [Nazgûl](/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl \"Nazgûl\").\n\nThe tone of the Moria sequence was altered. In the book, following the defeat\non the Caradhras road, Gandalf advocates the Moria road against the resistance\nof the rest of the Fellowship (save Gimli), suggesting \"there is a hope that\nMoria is still free...there is even a chance that Dwarves are there,\" though\nno one seems to think this likely. Frodo proposes they take a company vote,\nbut the discovery of [Wargs](/wiki/Warg#J._R._R._Tolkien.27s_wargs \"Warg\") on\ntheir trail forces them to accept Gandalf's proposal. They only realise the\nDwarves are all dead once they reach [Balin](/wiki/Balin_\\(Middle-earth\\)\n\"Balin \\(Middle-earth\\)\")'s tomb. The filmmakers chose instead for Gandalf to\nresist the Moria plan as a [foreshadowing](/wiki/Foreshadowing\n\"Foreshadowing\") device. Gandalf says to Gimli he would prefer not to enter\nMoria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's hesitance, revealing an\nillustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are\ninstantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria.[27] One detail that many\ncritics commented upon is the fact that, in the novel, Pippin tosses a mere\npebble into the well in Moria (\"They then hear what sounds like a hammer\ntapping in the distance\"), whereas in the film, he knocks an entire skeleton\nin (\"Next, the skeleton ... falls down the well, also dragging down a chain\nand bucket. The noise is incredible.\"[28])[29][30][31][32]\n\nIn terms of dramatic structure, the book simply ends; there is no climax,\nbecause Tolkien wrote the \"trilogy\" as a single story published in three\nvolumes. Jackson's version incorporates the first chapter of '\"The Two Towers\"\nand makes its events, told in real time instead of flashback, simultaneous\nwith the Breaking of the Fellowship. This finale is played as a climactic\nbattle, into which he introduces the Uruk-hai referred to as Lurtz in the\nscript. In the book, Boromir is unable to tell Aragorn which hobbits were\nkidnapped by the orcs before he dies. From there, Aragorn deduces Frodo's\nintentions when he notices that a boat is missing and Sam's pack is gone. In\nthe film, Aragorn and Frodo have a scene together in which Frodo's intentions\nare explicitly stated.\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n[Peter Jackson](/wiki/Peter_Jackson \"Peter Jackson\") began working with\n[Christian Rivers](/wiki/Christian_Rivers \"Christian Rivers\") to\n[storyboard](/wiki/Storyboard \"Storyboard\") the series in August 1997, as well\nas getting [Richard Taylor](/wiki/Richard_Taylor_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Richard Taylor\n\\(filmmaker\\)\") and [Weta Workshop](/wiki/Weta_Workshop \"Weta Workshop\") to\nbegin creating his interpretation of Middle-earth.[33] Jackson told them to\nmake Middle-earth as plausible and believable as possible, to think of Middle-\nearth in a historical manner.[34]\n\nIn November,[34] [Alan Lee](/wiki/Alan_Lee_\\(illustrator\\) \"Alan Lee\n\\(illustrator\\)\") and [John Howe](/wiki/John_Howe_\\(illustrator\\) \"John Howe\n\\(illustrator\\)\") became the film trilogy's primary conceptual designers,\nhaving had previous experience as illustrators for the book and various other\ntie-ins.

One noticeable illusion that appears in\nalmost every scene involves setting a proper scale so that the characters are\nall the correct height. Elijah Wood, who plays Frodo, is 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m)\ntall in real life, but the character of Frodo Baggins is barely four feet in\nheight. Many different tricks were used to depict the hobbits (and Gimli the\nDwarf) as being of diminutive stature. (In a happy coincidence, John-Rhys\nDavies – who played Gimli – is as tall compared to the Hobbit actors as his\ncharacter needed to be compared to theirs, so he did not need to be filmed\nseparately as a third variation of height, and is quite taller than Orlando\nBloom, who played Legolas.) Large- and small-scale doubles were used in\ncertain scenes, while entire duplicates of certain sets (including [Bag\nEnd](/wiki/Bag_End \"Bag End\") in Hobbiton) were built at two different scales,\nso that the characters would appear to be the appropriate size. At one point\nin the film, Frodo runs along a corridor in Bag End, followed by Gandalf.\nElijah Wood and Ian McKellen were filmed in separate versions of the same\ncorridor, built at two different scales, and a fast camera pan conceals the\nedit between the two. [Forced perspective](/wiki/Forced_perspective \"Forced\nperspective\") was also employed, so that it would look as though the short\nHobbits were interacting with taller [Men](/wiki/Man_\\(Middle-earth\\) \"Man\n\\(Middle-earth\\)\") and Elves. Even the simple use of kneeling down, to the\nfilmmakers' surprise, turned out to be an effective method in creating the\nillusion.\n\nFor the battle between the Last Alliance and Sauron's forces that begins the\nfilm, an elaborate [CGI](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-generated\nimagery\") animation system, called [MASSIVE](/wiki/MASSIVE_\\(software\\)\n\"MASSIVE \\(software\\)\"), was developed by [Stephen\nRegelous](/wiki/Stephen_Regelous \"Stephen Regelous\"); it allowed thousands of\nindividual animated \"characters\" in the program to act independently. This\nhelped give the illusion of realism to the battle sequences. The \"Making of\"\nLord of the Rings DVD reports some interesting initial problems: in the first\nexecution of a battle between groups of characters, the wrong groups attacked\neach other. In another early demo, some of the warriors at the edge of the\nfield could be seen running away. They were initially moving in the wrong\ndirection, and had been programmed to keep running until they encountered an\nenemy.\n\nThe digital creatures were important due to Jackson's requirement of\nbiological plausibility. Their surface was scanned from large\n[maquettes](/wiki/Maquette \"Maquette\") before numerous digital details of\ntheir skeletons and muscles were added. In the case of the Balrog, Gray\nHorsfield created a system that copied recorded imagery of fire.\n\n###\nScore[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Score\")]\n\nMain article: [The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n(soundtrack)](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring_\\(soundtrack\\)\n\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring \\(soundtrack\\)\")\n\nSee also: [Music of The Lord of the Rings film\nseries](/wiki/Music_of_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_series \"Music of The Lord of\nthe Rings film series\")\n\nThe [musical score](/wiki/Film_score \"Film score\") for _The Lord of the Rings_\nfilms was composed by [Howard Shore](/wiki/Howard_Shore \"Howard Shore\").

It is an awesome production in its daring and breadth, and\nthere are small touches that are just right\".[50] _[USA Today](/wiki/USA_Today\n\"USA Today\")_ also gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"this\nmovie version of a beloved book should please devotees as well as the\nuninitiated\".[51] In his review for _[The New York\nTimes](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ , [Elvis\nMitchell](/wiki/Elvis_Mitchell \"Elvis Mitchell\") wrote, \"The playful\nspookiness of Mr. Jackson's direction provides a lively, light touch, a\ngesture that doesn't normally come to mind when Tolkien's name is\nmentioned\".[52] _[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly\n\"Entertainment Weekly\")_ magazine gave the film an \"A\" rating and Lisa\nSchwarzbaum wrote, \"The cast take to their roles with becoming modesty,\ncertainly, but Jackson also makes it easy for them: His _Fellowship_ flows,\nnever lingering for the sake of admiring its own beauty ...

I may have never turned a page of Tolkien, but I know\nenchantment when I see it\".[53]\n\nIn her review for _[The Washington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The\nWashington Post\")_ , Rita Kempley praised the cast, in particular, \"Mortensen,\nas Strider, is a revelation, not to mention downright gorgeous. And McKellen,\ncarrying the burden of thousands of years' worth of the fight against evil, is\npositively Merlinesque\".[54] _[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine's Richard Corliss praised Jackson's work: \"His movie\nachieves what the best fairy tales do: the creation of an alternate world,\nplausible and persuasive, where the young — and not only the young — can lose\nthemselves. And perhaps, in identifying with the little Hobbit that could,\nfind their better selves\".[55] In his review for _[The Village\nVoice](/wiki/The_Village_Voice \"The Village Voice\")_ , [J.\nHoberman](/wiki/J._Hoberman \"J.

Jackson deserves to revel in his\nsuccess. He's made a three-hour film that leaves you wanting more\".[57]\nHowever, in his review for _[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_\n, Peter Bradshaw wrote, \"there is a strange paucity of plot complication, an\nabsence of anything unfolding, all the more disconcerting because of the\nclotted and indigestible mythic back story that we have to wade through before\nanything happens at all\".[58]\n\nIn [CinemaScore](/wiki/CinemaScore \"CinemaScore\") polls conducted during the\nopening weekend, cinema audiences gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an\nA+ to F scale.[59]\n\n###\nAccolades[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Accolades\")]\n\nMain article: [List of accolades received by The Lord of the Rings film\nseries](/wiki/List_of_accolades_received_by_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_series\n\"List of accolades received by The Lord of the Rings film series\")\n\nIn [2002](/wiki/74th_Academy_Awards \"74th Academy Awards\"), the film won four\n[Academy Awards](/wiki/Academy_Award \"Academy Award\") from thirteen\nnominations.[60] The winning categories were for [Best\nCinematography](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography \"Academy Award for\nBest Cinematography\"), [Best Visual\nEffects](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Visual_Effects \"Academy Award for Best\nVisual Effects\"), [Best\nMakeup](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Makeup_and_Hairstyling \"Academy Award for\nBest Makeup and Hairstyling\"), and [Best Original\nScore](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score \"Academy Award for Best\nOriginal Score\").
