He is voiced by [Seth\nGreen](/wiki/Seth_Green \"Seth Green\") and first appeared on television, along\nwith the rest of the family, in a 15-minute [short](/wiki/Short_film \"Short\nfilm\") on December 20, 1998. Chris was created and designed by MacFarlane\nhimself. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the [Fox Broadcasting\nCompany](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting Company\"), based on\n[_The Life of Larry_ and _Larry &\nSteve_](/wiki/The_Life_of_Larry_and_Larry_%26_Steve \"The Life of Larry and\nLarry & Steve\"), two shorts made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged man\nnamed Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the\ngreen light, the Griffin family appeared in the episode \"[Death Has a\nShadow](/wiki/Death_Has_a_Shadow \"Death Has a Shadow\")\".\n\nOriginally designed as a somewhat gregarious, yet still unintelligent\nteenager, Chris became more awkward and even more idiotic over the course of\nthe show. Running gags in the series involving Chris include the existence of\nan 'Evil Monkey' in his closet (though it is later revealed that [the monkey\nis not evil](/wiki/Hannah_Banana \"Hannah Banana\")), him\n[masturbating](/wiki/Masturbation \"Masturbation\") frequently, and his\npedophile admirer [Herbert](/wiki/Herbert_\\(Family_Guy\\) \"Herbert \\(Family\nGuy\\)\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Character origins\n  * 2 Personality\n  * 3 Evil Monkey\n  * 4 Identification with Seth Green\n  * 5 Appearance\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Character\norigins[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chris_Griffin&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Character origins\")]\n\nChris' character resembles that of Milt's, the son of the main character Larry\nCummings in _[The Life of Larry](/wiki/Larry_shorts \"Larry shorts\")_ , one of\nthe animated short films created by [Seth MacFarlane](/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane\n\"Seth MacFarlane\") at the [Rhode Island School of\nDesign](/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design \"Rhode Island School of Design\")\nin 1995 that led to the development of _Family Guy_.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Chris\nwas originally given a \"[punk](/wiki/Punk_rock \"Punk rock\")\" image, according\nto creator [Seth MacFarlane](/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane \"Seth MacFarlane\")'s DVD\ncommentary tracks. During the first three seasons, he wore gold earrings, and\nhis painful awkwardness was not as emphasized as it was supposed to be in the\nseries, as he has now slowly become more gregarious.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Personality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chris_Griffin&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Personality\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

On the Volume 1 DVD\nBoxset TV guides special _Family Guy_ edition, it stated that Chris \"wouldn't\nhurt a fly, unless it landed on his hot dog\". Due to Chris' weight, he was\nreferred to as an \"Elephant Child\" when he was born. In one episode as Chris\nruns away from his pedophile admirer, [Herbert](/wiki/Herbert_\\(Family_Guy\\)\n\"Herbert \\(Family Guy\\)\"), Herbert murmers to himself, \"Get your fat ass back\nhere!\"\n\nChris is more often than not willing to take drastic measures to get what he\nwants or needs, particularly when it comes to keeping up with his grades in\nschool. He once believed that he got a bad grade on a mathematics test when he\ntickled his brain by sticking an army man's rifle into his nose and\naccidentally puncturing a lobe. Fortunately, he is more well-endowed than\nPeter is, as he has a variety of talents, such as [drawing](/wiki/Drawing\n\"Drawing\"), [filmmaking](/wiki/Filmmaking \"Filmmaking\"), [video\nediting](/wiki/Video_editing \"Video editing\"), playing sports at school, etc.\nHe also has an encyclopedic knowledge of [pop culture](/wiki/Pop_culture \"Pop\nculture\"), as well as films, television series, actors and actresses, tropes,\nmaking a film good or bad, etc. Generally, Chris is a fast learner; in\n\"[Patriot Games](/wiki/Patriot_Games_\\(Family_Guy\\) \"Patriot Games \\(Family\nGuy\\)\")\", when the family moved to [London](/wiki/London \"London\"), Chris was\nthe only member of the family who learned how to speak [cockney\nEnglish](/wiki/Cockney_English \"Cockney English\") in a matter of seconds.\n\nDespite this, Chris can be naive, often to the point of having a tendency to\nget away with things. In \"[Lethal Weapons](/wiki/Lethal_Weapons \"Lethal\nWeapons\")\", when Peter and Lois were having a fist fight, Chris cheered for\n[Peter](/wiki/Peter_Griffin \"Peter Griffin\"), telling him to \"kick her ass!\";\nearlier in the episode, after Chris breaks a vase with his basketball and Lois\ntells Peter to punish him, Peter tells him to \"punish himself\" and\nsubsequently [spanks](/wiki/Corporal_punishment \"Corporal punishment\")\nhimself. Also, in _Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story_ , when the children watch\nLois and Peter are trying to make out, Chris mistakes it for a fight and says,\n\"I don't know what they're fighting about, Meg, but I think Dad's winning. Go\nDad!\" In the episode \"[Trading Places](/wiki/Trading_Places_\\(Family_Guy\\)\n\"Trading Places \\(Family Guy\\)\")\", after Chris accidentally damages Peter's\n[dirt bike](/wiki/Dirt_bike \"Dirt bike\"), Peter \"punishes\" him by making him\n[start smoking](/wiki/Tobacco_smoking \"Tobacco smoking\").\n\nFor most of the series, Chris is more socially active at school than Meg is,\nhaving various friends, both of which are boys and girls, whilst attending\nBuddy Cianci Junior High School (later James Woods Regional High School). Not\nsurprisingly, as the series progressed and Meg became more often seen with her\ngroup of friends, Chris' social status was boosted to the point of being\nfriends with everyone at James Woods Regional High School.[_[episode\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] In [Stew-\nRoids](/wiki/Stew-Roids \"Stew-Roids\"), the school's [queen\nbee](/wiki/Queen_bee \"Queen bee\") Connie D'Amico dates Chris, at first to be\nmore popular because of \"dating a loser\", but begins to see Chris as he really\nis after he says he likes her as well. Later in the episode however, she dumps\nhim after making out with two other boys at a house party, but everyone takes\npity on Chris and shuns Connie. Angry at Chris for usurping her place on the\nschool's \"social ladder\", she attempts to humiliate Chris by tricking [Neil\nGoldman](/wiki/Neil_Goldman \"Neil Goldman\") into showing the students a video\nof him re-enacting a scene from the [Silence of the\nLambs](/wiki/The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_\\(film\\) \"The Silence of the Lambs\n\\(film\\)\") where Buffalo Bill dances nude in front of a mirror, but Meg and\nChris's friends manage to stop her. Afterwards, Chris makes a speech over the\nPA system about what it is like to be popular, and then says \"man, it's hard\nwork being this shallow\". In [\"Once Bitten\"](/wiki/Once_Bitten_\\(Family_Guy\\)\n\"Once Bitten \\(Family Guy\\)\"), Chris becomes friends with [Neil\nGoldman](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_Family_Guy#Neil_Goldman \"List of\ncharacters in Family Guy\"), the resident nerd who is Meg's self-proclaimed\nlove interest. Although their friendship was initially a ploy for Neil to get\ncloser to Meg, Neil feels bad for using Chris and returns to him to resume\ntheir newfound friendship.\n\n## Evil Monkey[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chris_Griffin&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Evil Monkey\")]\n\nIn a [running gag](/wiki/Running_gag \"Running gag\"), starting in the episode\n\"[Dammit Janet!](/wiki/Dammit_Janet! \"Dammit Janet!\"),\" Chris is regularly\ntormented by an [evil monkey](/wiki/Evil_Monkey \"Evil Monkey\") who lives in\nhis closet, though whenever he complains about it to anyone, they (a reference\nto the iconic tale of the [Boy Who Cried Wolf](/wiki/Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf \"Boy\nWho Cried Wolf\")) often laugh along with him instead thinking it is a joke,\nafter which the monkey appears with a malevolent grimace and points at Chris\nin a threatening manner. In \"[Hannah Banana](/wiki/Hannah_Banana \"Hannah\nBanana\")\", Chris proves the monkey's part in the show to the family, and even\nends up becoming friends with him after the monkey (who appears not to be evil\nat all, but just a poor creature who was depressed after his ex-wife cheated\non him with another monkey) helps him write out a book report and pass. The\nsimian explains his frightening mannerisms as a result of various conditions\nand unintended actions. Chris introduces him to his friends, hang out with\neach other in fun places, and the monkey helps Chris in his studies in school,\nwhich Peter does not do. This, however, causes a rift between Chris and Peter\nwhen Chris realizes that the monkey cares more for him than his father.\nEventually the monkey helps the two patch things up, especially after Peter\nsaves the monkey from [Miley Cyrus](/wiki/Miley_Cyrus \"Miley Cyrus\") (who is\ndepicted as an [android](/wiki/Android_\\(robot\\) \"Android \\(robot\\)\")) who had\nkidnapped him à la _[King Kong](/wiki/King_Kong_\\(2005_film\\) \"King Kong\n\\(2005 film\\)\")_. After that, the monkey happily moves out of Chris' closet to\nlive in the closet of Tom Tucker's son Jake, where the cycle will start in a\nnew beginning, as Jake himself experiences difficulty with his father.\n\nIn a 2003 interview, Seth MacFarlane stated that the writers thought it would\nbe funny to give Chris a childhood fear that is actually real, since he has \"a\nchildlike mind\".[2] The monkey's trademark grimace and pointing was the idea\nof writer [Mike Barker](/wiki/Mike_Barker_\\(producer\\) \"Mike Barker\n\\(producer\\)\").[2]\n\n## Identification with Seth\nGreen[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chris_Griffin&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Identification with Seth Green\")]\n\nAnother [running gag](/wiki/Running_gag \"Running gag\"), starting in the _[Star\nWars](/wiki/Star_Wars \"Star Wars\")_ remake episode \"[Blue\nHarvest](/wiki/Blue_Harvest_\\(Family_Guy\\) \"Blue Harvest \\(Family Guy\\)\")\",\nhas Chris defending _[Robot Chicken](/wiki/Robot_Chicken \"Robot Chicken\")_ , a\nshow created by portrayer Seth Green which is broadcast on the [Adult\nSwim](/wiki/Adult_Swim \"Adult Swim\") block on the [Cartoon\nNetwork](/wiki/Cartoon_Network \"Cartoon Network\") cable network. When Peter\n(_Family Guy_ creator Seth MacFarlane) denigrates that show in \"Blue Harvest\",\nChris loses his temper and storms off. Carried on in \"[Something, Something,\nSomething, Dark Side](/wiki/Something,_Something,_Something,_Dark_Side\n\"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\")\", though Chris attempts to keep\na cool head, he storms off again when Peter offers to tell the story of\n_[Without a Paddle](/wiki/Without_a_Paddle \"Without a Paddle\")_ , a critically\npanned film that features Seth Green. Both these scenes happen in the [framing\ndevice](/wiki/Framing_device \"Framing device\") of the episode and not in the\ninterior _Star Wars_ narrative, in which Green portrays Chris as _Star Wars_\nhero [Luke Skywalker](/wiki/Luke_Skywalker \"Luke Skywalker\"). In the final\n_Star Wars_ parody, \"[It's a Trap!](/wiki/It%27s_a_Trap! \"It's a Trap!\")\",\nmocking Green's career provokes further anger in Chris; Chris tries to defend\nGreen by citing _[Buffy the Vampire\nSlayer](/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_\\(TV_series\\) \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\n\\(TV series\\)\")_ as an example of a success in Green's career, but Carter\nPewterschmidt suggests that the popularity of _Buffy_ had been largely over-\nstated by _[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment\nWeekly\")_. These taunts give Chris—in character as Skywalker—the conviction to\nfight back against Stewie/[Darth Vader](/wiki/Darth_Vader \"Darth Vader\") and\nCarter/[Darth Sidious](/wiki/Darth_Sidious \"Darth Sidious\") (both played by\nMacFarlane). In the closing scenes of the episode's framing device, Chris gets\nto reverse the joke by poking fun at Seth MacFarlane's career, going so far as\nto suggest that _Family Guy_ is a rip-off of _[The\nSimpsons](/wiki/The_Simpsons \"The Simpsons\")_ ; MacFarlane is, however,\ndefended by the characters whom he voices (Peter, Brian and Stewie).\n\nOutside of the _Star Wars_ -themed episodes, \"[Road to the\nMultiverse](/wiki/Road_to_the_Multiverse \"Road to the Multiverse\")\" plays on\nthe running gag, but with Stewie (MacFarlane once more) provoking the _[Robot\nChicken](/wiki/Robot_Chicken \"Robot Chicken\")_ Universe counterpart of Chris\nby asking \"How does it feel to be on a major network for thirty seconds?\"\nwhich prompts Chris to say \"Fuck you!\".\n\n## Appearance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chris_Griffin&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Appearance\")]\n\nChris is the only Griffin family member to have blond hair, which is odd\nconsidering that Peter has brown hair and Lois has orange hair. He, like Meg,\nwears a signature hat, an orange and black baseball cap, and dresses in a blue\nT-shirt, black pants, and white hi-top sneakers with red stripes. In several\nof the early episodes, he, along with Lois, has had his ears pierced and wore\ngold earrings.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chris_Griffin&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** \"[Brian the Bachelor](/wiki/Brian_the_Bachelor \"Brian the Bachelor\")\". _[Family Guy](/wiki/Family_Guy \"Family Guy\")_.
