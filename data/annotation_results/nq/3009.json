        "# NFL regular season\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe [National Football League](/wiki/National_Football_League \"National\nFootball League\") (NFL) [regular season](/wiki/Season_\\(sport\\) \"Season\n\\(sport\\)\") begins the weekend after [Labor\nDay](/wiki/Labor_Day_\\(United_States\\) \"Labor Day \\(United States\\)\") in early\nSeptember and ends in December or early January. It consists of 256 games,\nwhere each team (32 total) plays 16 games during a 17-week period. Since 2012,\nthe NFL schedule generally has games in one of five time slots during the\nweek. The first game of the week is [played on Thursday\nnight](/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football \"Thursday Night Football\"), kicking off\nat 8:25 PM ([ET](/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone \"Eastern Time Zone\")). The majority\nof games are played on Sunday, most kicking off at 1:00 PM (ET), some late\nafternoon games starting at 4:05 or 4:25 PM (ET). Additionally, [one Sunday\nnight game](/wiki/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football \"NBC Sunday Night Football\") is\nplayed every week at 8:30 PM (ET). One [Monday night\ngame](/wiki/Monday_Night_Football \"Monday Night Football\") then starts at 8:30\nPM (ET) every week with the exception of the first week of the regular season,\nin which two Monday night games are played back-to-back (the second game\nalways occurring on the West coast), as well as the last week of the season,\nin which no Monday night game is held. In addition to these regularly\nscheduled games, there are occasionally games at other times, such as a\nSaturday afternoon or evening, or the annual [Thanksgiving Day\ngames](/wiki/NFL_on_Thanksgiving_Day \"NFL on Thanksgiving Day\") in which three\ngames are played. During the final week of the regular season, all games are\nheld on Sunday.\n\nIn place since 2006, the current broadcasting contract establishes broadcast\npartners for each game. The Sunday afternoon games are broadcast either on\n[CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") or [Fox](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox\nBroadcasting Company\"). CBS has the broadcast rights for teams in the\n[American Football Conference](/wiki/American_Football_Conference \"American\nFootball Conference\") while Fox has the rights for teams in the [National\nFootball Conference](/wiki/National_Football_Conference \"National Football\nConference\"). In games where teams from both conferences play each other, the\nnetwork with the broadcast rights for the \"away\" team will broadcast the game.\nIn each [local television market](/wiki/Media_market \"Media market\"), three\nSunday afternoon games are shown. One of the two networks gets a\n[doubleheader](/wiki/Doubleheader_\\(television\\) \"Doubleheader\n\\(television\\)\"), while the other network has the right to broadcast a single\ngame; the networks alternate weeks when each has the right to the\ndoubleheader. Doubleheader games are broadcast at 1:00 (ET) and 4:25 PM (ET).\nThe network with the single game will have an official kick-off time at either\n1:00 PM (ET) or 4:05 PM (ET). In addition to the regular Sunday afternoon\ngames, there are three [prime time](/wiki/Prime_time \"Prime time\") games each\nweek. The Thursday night game is broadcast by the [NFL\nNetwork](/wiki/NFL_Network \"NFL Network\") (with, starting in 2016, five of\nthose Thursday games also being [simulcast](/wiki/Simulcast \"Simulcast\") by\nCBS and another five on [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\")).[1] The Sunday night game is\nbroadcast by [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\"), while the Monday night game is broadcast\nby [ESPN](/wiki/ESPN \"ESPN\").\n\nThe NFL uses a strict scheduling [algorithm](/wiki/Algorithm \"Algorithm\") to\ndetermine which teams play each other from year to year, based on the current\ndivision alignments and the final division standings from the previous season.\nThe current formula has been in place since [2002](/wiki/2002_NFL_season \"2002\nNFL season\"), the last year that the NFL expanded its membership. Generally,\neach team plays the other three teams in its own\n[division](/wiki/National_Football_League#Clubs \"National Football League\")\ntwice, all four teams from a single division in the AFC once, all four teams\nfrom a single division in the NFC once, and two additional intraconference\ngames based on the standings from the previous season.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Game times\n  * 2 History\n  * 3 Scheduling formula\n    * 3.1 Current formula\n    * 3.2 Past formulas\n      * 3.2.1 1995–1998 NFL scheduling formula\n      * 3.2.2 1978–1994 NFL scheduling formula\n      * 3.2.3 Regular season expansion proposals\n  * 4 Scheduled division matchups\n  * 5 Regular season games played outside the U.S.\n  * 6 Disruptions of the schedule\n    * 6.1 Conflicts with other sports leagues and organizations\n    * 6.2 Labor disputes\n    * 6.3 Natural disasters\n    * 6.4 Other major news events\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n\n## Game\ntimes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Game times\")]\n\nMain article: [NFL on television](/wiki/NFL_on_television \"NFL on television\")\n\nSince 1990, the majority of NFL regular-season games are played on Sundays at\n1 pm, or around 4:00 to 4:25pm [ET](/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone \"Eastern Time\nZone\") (see below), with the late afternoon (ET) games usually reserved either\nfor matches hosted in the [Pacific Time Zone](/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone \"Pacific\nTime Zone\") or [Mountain Time Zone](/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone \"Mountain Time\nZone\"), or for one or more marquee contests. The current NFL television\ncontract awards the American broadcast of these games to Fox or CBS, with Fox\nshowing games where the visiting team is from the NFC and CBS showing games\nwhere the visiting team is from the AFC. Each of these Sunday afternoon games\nis televised on a regional basis to a few or several areas around the country.\n\nOn each Sunday of the regular season, either CBS or Fox air two games in a\ndoubleheader package, while the other network may show only one game. Late\ngames scheduled to air on the network showing only one game are scheduled to\nstart at 4:00pm EST, while the second game of a doubleheader will kick off\nlater at 4:25pm; this is to avoid conflicts with 1:00pm games that have run\nlate.[2]\n\nThe schedule allows for 4 other regular time slots, in which these games are\nbroadcast nationally across the country:\n\n  1. One [Sunday night](/wiki/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football \"NBC Sunday Night Football\") game, which has been regularly scheduled since 1987, and has aired on NBC since 2006.\n  2. One [Monday Night Football](/wiki/Monday_Night_Football \"Monday Night Football\") game, which has been regularly scheduled since 1970, and has been appearing on ESPN since 2006. Also since 2006, two games have been on the first Monday of the season. The practice of holding a Monday night game during the last week of the season ended after the 2002 season due to, among other reasons, low ratings, and a competitive imbalance involved for potential playoff teams who would have one less day of rest before the postseason.\n  3. On Thursday nights since 2006, one game has been played and aired on the [NFL Network](/wiki/NFL_Network \"NFL Network\") on the weeks including and after [Thanksgiving Day](/wiki/Thanksgiving_Day \"Thanksgiving Day\"). In addition, during the day on Thanksgiving, the NFL has played [Thanksgiving Day games](/wiki/NFL_on_Thanksgiving_Day \"NFL on Thanksgiving Day\") since 1920; by tradition the [Dallas Cowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\") and the [Detroit Lions](/wiki/Detroit_Lions \"Detroit Lions\") always host these afternoon games, and in recent years there has been a night game as well on Thanksgiving. Beginning with the 2012 season, the NFL has played games on Thursday nights for the whole season.\n  4. Should there be a need for it, an occasional Saturday afternoon or night game, only in mid to late December, due to the [Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961](/wiki/Sports_Broadcasting_Act_of_1961 \"Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961\"). December Saturday games have been a part of the schedule every season since 1970, except for 2013.\n\nSince the 2006 season, the NFL has used a \"[flexible\nscheduling](/wiki/NFL_on_television#Flexible_scheduling \"NFL on television\")\"\nsystem for the last seven weeks of the regular season when there is a Sunday\nnight game. In 2014, that was expanded to include weeks 5 – 17.[3] Flex\nscheduling ensures quality matchups on Sunday nights and it allows for\nsurprise teams to play in primetime.\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nNumber of regular season games per team  \n---  \n[1935](/wiki/1935_NFL_season \"1935 NFL season\")–[1936](/wiki/1936_NFL_season \"1936 NFL season\") | 12 games  \n[1937](/wiki/1937_NFL_season \"1937 NFL season\")–[1942](/wiki/1942_NFL_season \"1942 NFL season\"), [1946](/wiki/1946_NFL_season \"1946 NFL season\") | 11 games (12 weeks)  \n[1943](/wiki/1943_NFL_season \"1943 NFL season\")–[1945](/wiki/1945_NFL_season \"1945 NFL season\") | 10 games (12 weeks)  \n[1947](/wiki/1947_NFL_season \"1947 NFL season\")–[1960](/wiki/1960_NFL_season \"1960 NFL season\") | 12 games (variable weeks)  \n[1961](/wiki/1961_NFL_season \"1961 NFL season\")–[1965](/wiki/1965_NFL_season \"1965 NFL season\"), [1967](/wiki/1967_NFL_season \"1967 NFL season\")-[1977](/wiki/1977_NFL_season \"1977 NFL season\") | 14 games (14 weeks)  \n[1966](/wiki/1966_NFL_season \"1966 NFL season\") | 14 games (15 weeks, odd number of teams)  \n[1978](/wiki/1978_NFL_season \"1978 NFL season\")–[1981](/wiki/1981_NFL_season \"1981 NFL season\"), [1983](/wiki/1983_NFL_season \"1983 NFL season\")–[1986](/wiki/1986_NFL_season \"1986 NFL season\"), [1988](/wiki/1988_NFL_season \"1988 NFL season\")–[1989](/wiki/1989_NFL_season \"1989 NFL season\") | 16 games (16 weeks)  \n[1982](/wiki/1982_NFL_season \"1982 NFL season\") | 9 games (17 weeks, strike)  \n[1987](/wiki/1987_NFL_season \"1987 NFL season\") | 15 games (16 weeks, strike)  \n[1990](/wiki/1990_NFL_season \"1990 NFL season\")–[1992](/wiki/1992_NFL_season \"1992 NFL season\"), [1994](/wiki/1994_NFL_season \"1994 NFL season\")–[2000](/wiki/2000_NFL_season \"2000 NFL season\"), [2002](/wiki/2002_NFL_season \"2002 NFL season\")–present | 16 games (17 weeks)  \n[1993](/wiki/1993_NFL_season \"1993 NFL season\") | 16 games (18 weeks, additional bye week)  \n[2001](/wiki/2001_NFL_season \"2001 NFL season\") | 16 games (18 weeks, [September 11 attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks \"September 11 attacks\"))  \n  \nIn its early years after [1920](/wiki/1920_NFL_season \"1920 NFL season\"), the\nNFL did not have a set schedule, and teams played as few as eight and as many\nas sixteen games, many against independent professional, college, or amateur\nteams. From [1926](/wiki/1926_NFL_season \"1926 NFL season\") through\n[1946](/wiki/1946_NFL_season \"1946 NFL season\"), they played from eleven to\nfourteen games per season, depending on the number of teams in the league.\nFrom [1947](/wiki/1947_NFL_season \"1947 NFL season\") through\n[1960](/wiki/1960_NFL_season \"1960 NFL season\"), each NFL team played 12 games\nper season. The [American Football League](/wiki/American_Football_League\n\"American Football League\") began play in\n[1960](/wiki/1960_American_Football_League_season \"1960 American Football\nLeague season\") and introduced a balanced schedule of 14 games per team over a\nfifteen-week season, in which each of the eight teams played each of the other\nteams twice, with one bye week. Competition from the new league caused the NFL\nto expand and follow suit with a fourteen-game schedule in\n[1961](/wiki/1961_NFL_season \"1961 NFL season\").\n\nAlso in 1961, the [U.S. Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States\nCongress\") passed the [Sports Broadcasting\nAct](/wiki/Sports_Broadcasting_Act_of_1961 \"Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961\")\nin response to a court decision which ruled that the NFL's method of\nnegotiating television broadcasting rights violated [antitrust\nlaws](/wiki/Antitrust_law \"Antitrust law\"). The law allows the league to sell\nthe rights to all regular season and postseason games to the networks, but\nprohibits the league from directly competing with high school and college\nfootball games. Since high school and college teams typically play games on\nFriday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on those days\nuntil those seasons generally end in mid-December.[4]\n\nFrom [1961](/wiki/1961_NFL_season \"1961 NFL season\") through\n[1977](/wiki/1977_NFL_season \"1977 NFL season\"), the NFL schedule consisted of\nfourteen regular season games played over fourteen weeks, except in\n[1966](/wiki/1966_NFL_season \"1966 NFL season\"). Opening weekend typically was\nthe weekend after [Labor Day](/wiki/Labor_Day_\\(United_States\\) \"Labor Day\n\\(United States\\)\"), or rarely two weekends after Labor Day. Teams played six\nor seven exhibition games. In 1966 (and 1960), the NFL had an odd number of\nfranchises, so one team was idle each week. In [1978](/wiki/1978_NFL_season\n\"1978 NFL season\"), the league changed the schedule to include sixteen regular\nseason games and four exhibition games. From 1978 through\n[1989](/wiki/1989_NFL_season \"1989 NFL season\"), the sixteen games were played\nover sixteen weeks.\n\nIn [1990](/wiki/1990_NFL_season \"1990 NFL season\"), the NFL re-introduced a\n[bye week](/wiki/Bye_\\(sports\\) \"Bye \\(sports\\)\") to the schedule, which it\nhad not had since 1966. Each team played sixteen regular season games over\nseventeen weeks. During the season, on a rotating basis, each team would have\nthe weekend off. As a result, opening weekend was moved up to Labor Day\nweekend. The league had an odd number of teams (31) from\n[1999](/wiki/1999_NFL_season \"1999 NFL season\") to\n[2001](/wiki/2001_NFL_season \"2001 NFL season\"). During that period, at least\none team had to be given a bye on any given week. For the\n[1993](/wiki/1993_NFL_season \"1993 NFL season\") season, the league\nexperimented with the schedule by adding a second bye week for each team,\nresulting in an 18-week regular season. In 2001, the September 11th attacks\nresulted in the league postponing its week 2 games, leading to another 18-week\nseason.\n\nSince the [2002](/wiki/2002_NFL_season \"2002 NFL season\") season, the league\nhas scheduled a nationally televised regular season [kickoff\ngame](/wiki/NFL_Kickoff_game \"NFL Kickoff game\") on the Thursday night after\nLabor Day, prior to the first Sunday of NFL games to kick off the season. The\nfirst one, featuring the [San Francisco\n49ers](/wiki/2002_San_Francisco_49ers_season \"2002 San Francisco 49ers\nseason\") and the [New York Giants](/wiki/2002_New_York_Giants_season \"2002 New\nYork Giants season\"), was held on September 5, 2002 largely to celebrate New\nYork City's resilience in the wake of the [September 11, 2001\nattacks](/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks \"September 11, 2001 attacks\").[5]\nSince 2004, the NFL has indicated that the opening game will normally be\nhosted by the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their\ntitle defense. Under this scheduling system, the earliest the regular season\ncould begin is September 4, as it was in the [2008](/wiki/2008_NFL_season\n\"2008 NFL season\") and [2014](/wiki/2014_NFL_season \"2014 NFL season\")\nseasons, due to September 1 falling on a Monday, while the latest possible is\nSeptember 10, as it was in the [2009](/wiki/2009_NFL_season \"2009 NFL season\")\nand [2015](/wiki/2015_NFL_season \"2015 NFL season\") seasons, due to September\n1 falling on a Tuesday.\n\n## Scheduling\nformula[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Scheduling formula\")]\n\n### Current\nformula[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Current formula\")]\n\nPOS | NFC East | NFC North | NFC South | NFC West  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n1st | [Eagles](/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles \"Philadelphia Eagles\") | [Vikings](/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings \"Minnesota Vikings\") | [Saints](/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints \"New Orleans Saints\") | [Rams](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams \"Los Angeles Rams\")  \n2nd | [Cowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\") | [Lions](/wiki/Detroit_Lions \"Detroit Lions\") | [Panthers](/wiki/Carolina_Panthers \"Carolina Panthers\") | [Seahawks](/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks \"Seattle Seahawks\")  \n3rd | [Redskins](/wiki/Washington_Redskins \"Washington Redskins\") | [Packers](/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers \"Green Bay Packers\") | [Falcons](/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons \"Atlanta Falcons\") | [Cardinals](/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals \"Arizona Cardinals\")  \n4th | [Giants](/wiki/New_York_Giants \"New York Giants\") | [Bears](/wiki/Chicago_Bears \"Chicago Bears\") | [Buccaneers](/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\") | [49ers](/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers \"San Francisco 49ers\")  \nPOS | AFC East | AFC North | AFC South | AFC West  \n1st | [Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\") | [Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") | [Jaguars](/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars \"Jacksonville Jaguars\") | [Chiefs](/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs \"Kansas City Chiefs\")  \n2nd | [Bills](/wiki/Buffalo_Bills \"Buffalo Bills\") | [Ravens](/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens \"Baltimore Ravens\") | [Titans](/wiki/Tennessee_Titans \"Tennessee Titans\") | [Chargers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers \"Los Angeles Chargers\")  \n3rd | [Dolphins](/wiki/Miami_Dolphins \"Miami Dolphins\") | [Bengals](/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals \"Cincinnati Bengals\") | [Colts](/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts \"Indianapolis Colts\") | [Raiders](/wiki/Oakland_Raiders \"Oakland Raiders\")  \n4th | [Jets](/wiki/New_York_Jets \"New York Jets\") | [Browns](/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland Browns\") | [Texans](/wiki/Houston_Texans \"Houston Texans\") | [Broncos](/wiki/Denver_Broncos \"Denver Broncos\")  \n  \nThis chart of the [2017 season\nstandings](/wiki/2017_NFL_season#Regular_season_standings \"2017 NFL season\")\ndisplays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The [Philadelphia\nEagles in 2017](/wiki/2017_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2017 Philadelphia\nEagles season\") (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the [NFC\nEast](/wiki/NFC_East \"NFC East\"). Thus, [in\n2018](/wiki/2018_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2018 Philadelphia Eagles\nseason\"), the Eagles will play two games against each of its division rivals\n(highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the [NFC\nSouth](/wiki/NFC_South \"NFC South\") and [AFC South](/wiki/AFC_South \"AFC\nSouth\") (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place\nfinishers in the [NFC North](/wiki/NFC_North \"NFC North\") and [NFC\nWest](/wiki/NFC_West \"NFC West\") (highlighted in orange).\n\nCurrently, the thirteen different opponents each team faces over the 16-game\nregular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:[6]\n\n  * Each team plays _twice_ against each of the other three teams in its division: once at home, and once on the road (six games).\n  * Each team plays _once_ against each of the four teams from another division within its own conference, with the assigned division based on a three-year rotation: two at home, and two on the road (four games).\n  * Each team plays _once_ against one team from each of the remaining two divisions within its conference, based on the final division standings from the prior season: one at home, one on the road (two games).\n  * Each team plays _once_ against each of the four teams from a division in the other conference, with the assigned division based on a four-year rotation: two at home, and two on the road (four games).\n\nUnder this formula, all teams are guaranteed to play every other team in their\nown conference at least once every three years, and to play every team in the\nother conference exactly once every four years. The formula also guarantees a\nsimilar schedule for every team in a division each season, as all four teams\nwill play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents or each\nother.\n\nNon-divisional intraconference match-ups can occur over consecutive years if\ntwo teams happen to finish in the same place consistently. For example, even\nthough the [Colts](/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts \"Indianapolis Colts\") and\n[Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\") are in different\ndivisions within the same conference, the two teams played each other every\nseason between 2003 and 2012, largely because both teams often finished in\nfirst place in their divisions each previous season. Similarly, the\n[Redskins](/wiki/Washington_Redskins \"Washington Redskins\") and the\n[Rams](/wiki/St._Louis_Rams \"St. Louis Rams\") played each other each season\nfrom 2008 to 2012 because both teams often landed in fourth place in their\ndivisions.\n\nOutside intradivisional match-ups (each of which is played twice-yearly), the\nhome team for each match-up is also determined by the league according to a\nset rotation designed to largely alternate home and away designations over\nsuccessive years.[7] This rotation was slightly adjusted in 2010 for teams\nplaying against the [NFC West](/wiki/NFC_West \"NFC West\") and [AFC\nWest](/wiki/AFC_West \"AFC West\"), after several east-coast teams (such as the\n[New England Patriots](/wiki/2008_New_England_Patriots_season \"2008 New\nEngland Patriots season\") and [New York Jets](/wiki/2008_New_York_Jets_season\n\"2008 New York Jets season\") in [2008](/wiki/2008_NFL_season \"2008 NFL\nseason\")) all had to make four cross-country trips to play games in [San\nDiego](/wiki/San_Diego \"San Diego\"), [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San\nFrancisco\"), [Oakland](/wiki/Oakland \"Oakland\"), and [Seattle](/wiki/Seattle\n\"Seattle\") in one season.[8]\n\nAlthough this scheduling formula determines each of the thirty-two teams'\nrespective opponents, the league usually does not release the final regular\nschedule with specific dates and times until the spring; the NFL needs several\nmonths to coordinate the entire season schedule to align with various\nsecondary objectives, such as accommodating various scheduling conflicts and\nmaximizing potential TV ratings.[9][10] Since 2010, the last week of the\nregular season has consisted solely of divisional match-ups, in an attempt to\ndiscourage playoff-bound teams from resting their starters and playing their\nreserves.[11]\n\n### Past\nformulas[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Past formulas\")]\n\nPrior to [2002](/wiki/2002_NFL_season \"2002 NFL season\") (when the league\nexpanded to 32 teams) the league used similar scheduling rubrics, though they\nwere adjusted for the number of teams and divisions. From 1970 to 1994, and\nagain from 1999 to 2001, the league did not have equal numbers of teams in\nevery division, so not every team's opposition could be determined by the same\nmeans. While teams playing against their division rivals twice each has been a\ntradition since at least the [AFL–NFL merger](/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93NFL_merger\n\"AFL–NFL merger\"), not all teams would play the same amount of divisional\ngames between the divisions due to the imbalances that had existed. The AFC\nCentral in between 1999 and 2001, consisting of six teams resulting in part\nfrom the [Cleveland Browns relocation\ncontroversy](/wiki/Cleveland_Browns_relocation_controversy \"Cleveland Browns\nrelocation controversy\"), forced teams to play ten intradivision games in a\n16-game schedule. The only time since the merger that the league has been\ncompletely \"balanced\" has been from 1995 to 1998 (with six divisions of five\nteams each) and since 2002 (with eight divisions of four teams each). From\n1978 up to 2002, most teams always played four of the teams from a division in\nthe other conference on a rotating basis (with certain exceptions differing\nbetween time periods), while lacking a rotary schedule within its own\nconference; this meant that while a team would be more likely to play every\nteam in the other conference on a regular basis, they could go far longer\nwithout playing every team in their own. For example, between 1970 (when the\nleagues merged) and 2002 (when the current schedule was introduced) the Denver\nBroncos and the Miami Dolphins played only 6 times, including a stretch where\nthey met only once between 1976 and 1997.[12]\n\nPOS | AFC East | AFC Central | AFC West  \n---|---|---|---  \n1st | Bills | Bengals | Raiders  \n2nd | Dolphins | Oilers | Chiefs  \n3rd | Colts | Steelers | Seahawks  \n4th | Jets | Browns | Chargers  \n5th | Patriots |  | Broncos  \nPOS | NFC East | NFC Central | NFC West  \n1st | Giants | Bears | 49ers  \n2nd | Eagles | Buccaneers | Saints  \n3rd | Redskins | Lions | Rams  \n4th | Cowboys | Packers | Falcons  \n5th | Cardinals | Vikings |   \n  \nThis is an example of the formula used for determining opponents for teams\nthat finished in last place in each of the five-team divisions between 1978\nand 1994, when the league consisted of 28 teams playing 16 games each.

During these years, teams\nin five-team divisions who did not finish last would not normally face a 5th\nplace team outside their division, whether or not those teams were\nintraconference. There was a special so-called \"last place\" or \"fifth-place\"\nschedule for teams who finished in last place in a five-team division. In\naddition to their division games, a team who finished in last place in the\nprevious season would also primarily play the other teams who finished in last\nplace in their respective divisions (the intraconference one would be played\ntwice to fill a void otherwise taken by a _third_ team that finished the same\nplace), plus all the clubs in the four team division in their conference. An\nexample of this is also shown to the right. The teams in a four-team division\nplayed only six divisional games, as opposed to the eight that teams in five-\nteam divisions had played. This void would be filled by having to play against\nthe 5th place teams in their conference in addition to their regular\nscheduling, hence tying to the \"fifth-place\" schedule.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n#### Regular season expansion\nproposals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Regular season expansion proposals\")]\n\nThere have been proposals to expand the regular season schedule to 17 or 18\ngames per team. Current Commissioner [Roger Goodell](/wiki/Roger_Goodell\n\"Roger Goodell\") has said he favors expanding it to 18 games.[13] However, a\nlonger regular season proposal was defeated in the 2011 labor negotiations\nbetween the owners and the players association.[14][15] One of the proposals\nfor the 17th and 18th games is to have every team play at least one game\nabroad every year.[16] Another idea being put forth by [Houston\nTexans](/wiki/Houston_Texans \"Houston Texans\") owner [Bob\nMcNair](/wiki/Bob_McNair \"Bob McNair\") is to move the traditional regional\nrivalries that are currently played in the preseason (such as the Governor's\nCups) into a permanent annual part of each NFL team's schedule.[17] The NFL\nPlayers' Association opposes extending the season, largely because of injury\nconcerns, and extending the season would require that such an extension be\nincluded in the next [collective bargaining\nagreement](/wiki/Collective_bargaining_agreement \"Collective bargaining\nagreement\"). The collective bargaining agreement signed in 2011 maintained the\nsixteen game regular season schedule.\n\n## Scheduled division\nmatchups[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Scheduled division matchups\")]\n\nThis chart displays the current schedule of division match-ups, based on the\nthree-year intra-conference and four-year inter-conference rotations in place\nsince 2002.

This was abandoned when the [St. Louis Rams](/wiki/St._Louis_Rams \"St.\nLouis Rams\"), who are co-owned with [Arsenal](/wiki/Arsenal_F.C. \"Arsenal\nF.C.\"), a prominent soccer team in London, signed a three-year agreement to be\nthe home team in the International Series games in London. This plan has since\nbeen re-established after the Rams announced that they would not be returning\nto England in 2013; the Rams would return to London as host team in 2016.\n\nSince, the NFL has announced that the Jacksonville Jaguars will play one home\ngame a season at Wembley, up to and including 2016, later extended to 2020.\nTheir first game, versus the San Francisco 49ers, saw the 49ers winning\ncomfortably.[24] A second game was played at Wembley for the first time, with\nthe Minnesota Vikings hosting and beating the Pittsburgh Steelers.[25]\nMeanwhile, a record three fixtures were announced from the 2014 season, with\nthe Jacksonville Jaguars hosting the Dallas Cowboys, the Atlanta Falcons\nhosting the Detroit Lions and the Oakland Raiders hosting the Miami Dolphins\nat Wembley.[26]\n\nThe [Buffalo Bills](/wiki/Buffalo_Bills \"Buffalo Bills\") played one regular\nseason game each year from 2008 through 2013 in [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto\n\"Toronto\") as part of the [Bills Toronto Series](/wiki/Bills_Toronto_Series\n\"Bills Toronto Series\"); two preseason games were also played as part of the\nsame series. Poor ticket sales, fan disgust in Buffalo and the death of Bills\nowner [Ralph Wilson](/wiki/Ralph_Wilson \"Ralph Wilson\") prompted the\ncancellation of the series in 2014.\n\n## Disruptions of the\nschedule[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Disruptions of the schedule\")]\n\nSee also: [Canceled NFL games](/wiki/Canceled_NFL_games \"Canceled NFL games\")\nand [Temporary NFL home\nstadiums](/wiki/Chronology_of_home_stadiums_for_current_National_Football_League_teams#Temporary_home_stadiums\n\"Chronology of home stadiums for current National Football League teams\")\n\n### Conflicts with other sports leagues and\norganizations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Conflicts with other sports leagues and organizations\")]\n\nFrom the beginnings of the NFL, most teams shared stadiums with [Major League\nBaseball](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball \"Major League Baseball\") teams, with the\nMLB teams holding leases giving them priority. The NFL was required to\nschedule around September baseball games. In October, this frequently resulted\nin NFL teams having to reschedule on short notice if the MLB team in their\ncity made the playoffs. On some occasions, the NFL game could be moved to\nSaturday or Monday. The NFL would often schedule October division games so\nthat teams would be able to swap home game dates if it appeared that the MLB\nplayoff schedule would make a stadium unavailable to the NFL. Perhaps the most\nextreme case was in 1973, when the [New York Jets](/wiki/New_York_Jets \"New\nYork Jets\") played at [Shea Stadium](/wiki/Shea_Stadium \"Shea Stadium\") and\nwere forced to play their first six games on the road due to the\n[Mets](/wiki/New_York_Mets \"New York Mets\") playing in the [World\nSeries](/wiki/World_Series \"World Series\").\n\nAs more MLB teams started to move into baseball-only stadiums by the 1990s and\n2000s, this became less of a problem. Currently, the only remaining shared\nNFL-MLB venue is the [Oakland–Alameda County\nColiseum](/wiki/Oakland%E2%80%93Alameda_County_Coliseum \"Oakland–Alameda\nCounty Coliseum\"), which houses the [Oakland Raiders](/wiki/Oakland_Raiders\n\"Oakland Raiders\") and the [Oakland Athletics](/wiki/Oakland_Athletics\n\"Oakland Athletics\"). Additionally, three NFL teams currently share a venue\nwith a [Major League Soccer](/wiki/Major_League_Soccer \"Major League Soccer\")\nteam — the [New England Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England\nPatriots\") share [Gillette Stadium](/wiki/Gillette_Stadium \"Gillette Stadium\")\nwith the [New England Revolution](/wiki/New_England_Revolution \"New England\nRevolution\"), while the [Seattle Seahawks](/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks \"Seattle\nSeahawks\") share [CenturyLink Field](/wiki/CenturyLink_Field \"CenturyLink\nField\") with the [Seattle Sounders FC](/wiki/Seattle_Sounders_FC \"Seattle\nSounders FC\") and the [Los Angeles Chargers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers \"Los\nAngeles Chargers\") share the [StubHub Center](/wiki/StubHub_Center \"StubHub\nCenter\") with the [LA Galaxy](/wiki/LA_Galaxy \"LA Galaxy\"). However, there are\nsome NFL and MLB venues that share parking lots — most notably, the respective\nteams in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Seattle. In [2013](/wiki/2013_NFL_season\n\"2013 NFL season\"), the [Super Bowl XLVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVII \"Super Bowl\nXLVII\") champion [Baltimore Ravens](/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens \"Baltimore Ravens\")\nwere forced to open on the road due to this fact, as their MLB counterparts,\nthe [Baltimore Orioles](/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles \"Baltimore Orioles\"), were\nscheduled at home on the same day as the [Week 1 NFL Kickoff\ngame](/wiki/National_Football_League_Kickoff_game \"National Football League\nKickoff game\") and declined to either reschedule or relocate their game. (MLB\ntypically releases the schedule for an upcoming season during September of the\nprevious season, forcing the NFL to accommodate the scheduling needs of teams\nwho share parking lots or stadiums with MLB teams, while MLS typically\nreleases their season schedule well ahead of the NFL's schedule release.) The\n[Super Bowl XLVIII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVIII \"Super Bowl XLVIII\") champion\nSeattle Seahawks averted this conflict for the [2014](/wiki/2014_NFL_season\n\"2014 NFL season\") season opener, as their MLB counterparts, the [Seattle\nMariners](/wiki/Seattle_Mariners \"Seattle Mariners\"), played on the road;\ntheir respective venues also share the same parking lot. The Seattle Sounders\nFC also played on the road during the opening week of the 2014 NFL season,\nassuring no scheduling conflicts. The [Buffalo Bills](/wiki/Buffalo_Bills\n\"Buffalo Bills\") also hosted one game a year at the [Rogers\nCentre](/wiki/Rogers_Centre \"Rogers Centre\"), which is the home of the\n[Toronto Blue Jays](/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays \"Toronto Blue Jays\"), but this was\nonly an issue in the preseason, since all such regular season games were\nscheduled after the end of the MLB [World Series](/wiki/World_Series \"World\nSeries\").\n\nNFL teams have also shared stadiums with NCAA college football teams and [bowl\ngames](/wiki/Bowl_game \"Bowl game\"), either temporarily or permanently, but\nthe [Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961](/wiki/Sports_Broadcasting_Act_of_1961\n\"Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961\") prohibits the NFL from scheduling games on\nthe same days as college football games.[4]\n\n### Labor\ndisputes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Labor disputes\")]\n\nThe [1982](/wiki/1982_NFL_Season \"1982 NFL Season\") and\n[1987](/wiki/1987_NFL_Season \"1987 NFL Season\") seasons were both shortened by\n[labor disputes](/wiki/National_Football_League_Players_Association \"National\nFootball League Players Association\"). The [1982\nstrike](/wiki/National_Football_League_Players_Association#1982_strike\n\"National Football League Players Association\") lasted 57 days. Weeks 3\nthrough 10 were canceled, but an additional week was added to make a 9-game\nschedule. The 1982 playoff matchups were determined by conference standings\nonly. The [1987\nstrike](/wiki/National_Football_League_Players_Association#1987_strike_and_decertification\n\"National Football League Players Association\") and subsequent\n[lockout](/wiki/Lockout_\\(industry\\) \"Lockout \\(industry\\)\") lasted 24 days\nbut only one week of the schedule was lost. Weeks 4 through 6 were played with\n[replacement players](/wiki/Strikebreakers \"Strikebreakers\"). The rest of the\n[season](/wiki/1987_NFL_Season \"1987 NFL Season\") was played as originally\nscheduled, for a total of 15 games per team.\n\nIn the event that the [2011 NFL season](/wiki/2011_NFL_season \"2011 NFL\nseason\") had been disrupted because of a then-ongoing labor dispute, the NFL\nhad arranged its schedule to facilitate easier cancellations and\npostponements. In addition to an emergency scenario of an eight-game schedule\nbeginning in late November, the NFL also arranged its full-length schedule\nsuch that weeks 2 and 4 had no division games, week 17 had all division games,\nand all week 3 matchups could be moved into each team's respective bye week.\nThe league also had a contingency plan to postpone [Super Bowl\nXLVI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVI \"Super Bowl XLVI\") one week, which (assuming a\nfull playoff schedule) would allow a 13-game schedule with five division games\nfor each team to be played beginning as late as October 16.\n\n### Natural\ndisasters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NFL_regular_season&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Natural disasters\")]\n\nSeveral games have been postponed or relocated because of natural disasters. A\nfew days before the start of the [2005 NFL Season](/wiki/2005_NFL_Season \"2005\nNFL Season\"), the [Louisiana Superdome](/wiki/Louisiana_Superdome \"Louisiana\nSuperdome\") was severely damaged by [Hurricane\nKatrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina \"Hurricane Katrina\"), and much of the city of\n[New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\") was destroyed. The [New Orleans\nSaints](/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints \"New Orleans Saints\")' eight scheduled home\ngames were moved to other locations, including [Giants\nStadium](/wiki/Giants_Stadium \"Giants Stadium\"), the\n[Alamodome](/wiki/Alamodome \"Alamodome\") in [San Antonio](/wiki/San_Antonio\n\"San Antonio\"), and Tiger Stadium on the campus of [Louisiana State\nUniversity](/wiki/Louisiana_State_University \"Louisiana State University\"). On\nSeptember 14, 2008, the [Houston Texans](/wiki/Houston_Texans \"Houston\nTexans\") were scheduled to host the [Baltimore Ravens](/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens\n\"Baltimore Ravens\"). The game was postponed until November 9 because of\n[Hurricane Ike](/wiki/Hurricane_Ike \"Hurricane Ike\") (which caused some damage\nto [Reliant Stadium](/wiki/Reliant_Stadium \"Reliant Stadium\")) and several\nother changes had to be made to the schedule. The roof of the [Hubert H.\nHumphrey Metrodome](/wiki/Hubert_H._Humphrey_Metrodome \"Hubert H.
