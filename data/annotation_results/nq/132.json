However, using her real name she was highly accomplished\nand successful singing in groups. Ward's voice is heard in U.S. television\nseries, motion pictures, advertisements, and pop records. She is one of the\nreal singers of the hits attributed to The Partridge Family.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Biography\n    * 1.1 Early years\n    * 1.2 \"Wonderful Summer\"\n    * 1.3 Post \"Robin Ward\" TV, movies, and records singing\n    * 1.4 The Partridge Family\n  * 2 References\n  * 3 External links\n\n##\nBiography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robin_Ward_\\(singer\\)&action=edit&section=1&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Biography\")]\n\n### Early\nyears[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robin_Ward_\\(singer\\)&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Early years\")]\n\nWard was born Jacqueline McDonnell in 1941 to a military family in\n[Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii \"Hawaii\") (her father served in the [US\nNavy](/wiki/United_States_Navy \"United States Navy\")) and raised in\n[Nebraska](/wiki/Nebraska \"Nebraska\"). Her first public singing performances\nwere with her two sisters in a Nebraska church when she was eight years old.\nAfter the trio won a national talent search run by [Horace\nHeidt](/wiki/Horace_Heidt \"Horace Heidt\"),[1] they moved to [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\") to seek work in the [music\nindustry](/wiki/Music_industry \"Music industry\").\n\nAt the age of 13, Ward was hired by Los Angeles television station\n[KTLA](/wiki/KTLA \"KTLA\") to sing on a _[Your Hit\nParade](/wiki/Your_Hit_Parade \"Your Hit Parade\")_ -like program, _Bandstand\nRevue_ ; Ward performed popular hits for four years. Then she started a career\nof singing on demo and released recordings. One 1962 session was singing the\n\"la la la\" parts in [Pat Boone](/wiki/Pat_Boone \"Pat Boone\")'s \"[Speedy\nGonzales](/wiki/Speedy_Gonzales_\\(song\\) \"Speedy Gonzales \\(song\\)\")\", which\nbecame a million-selling single. ([Elton John](/wiki/Elton_John \"Elton John\")\nsaid the \"[hook](/wiki/Hook_\\(music\\) \"Hook \\(music\\)\")\" in his best-selling\nsingle \"[Crocodile Rock](/wiki/Crocodile_Rock \"Crocodile Rock\")\" was inspired\nby Ward's \"Speedy Gonzales\" vocal.)[2]\n\n### \"Wonderful\nSummer\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robin_Ward_\\(singer\\)&action=edit&section=3&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: \"Wonderful Summer\"\")]\n\nIn 1963, songwriter-producer [Perry Botkin Jr.](/wiki/Perry_Botkin_Jr. \"Perry\nBotkin Jr.\") hired Jackie Ward to make a demo recording of \"Wonderful Summer\",\na song he wrote with co-writer and co-producer Gil Garfield.[3] The purpose of\na demo is to persuade \"name\" singers to record a song by demonstrating how it\nmight be done. After recording Ward's vocal at [Gold Star\nStudios](/wiki/Gold_Star_Studios \"Gold Star Studios\") in Los Angeles, Botkin\nthought it might sound better if her voice was higher-pitched, so he sped up\nthe recording by wrapping splicing tape around the capstan of the machine.\nBotkin realized the finished recording, with bird and surf sound effects\nadded, was good enough to release as a pop music single. But because the sped-\nup singing sounded younger than 21-year-old Jackie Ward, she suggested using\nher daughter's first name Robin on the record label. That fall, \"Wonderful\nSummer\" was released by [Dot Records](/wiki/Dot_Records \"Dot Records\") as a\n45rpm single. Sales exceeded one million copies in the United States,\npropelling the record to #14 on the [Billboard Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") chart of December 14–21,\n1963.[4]\n\nAn album followed, with limited success. Jackie Ward made additional \"Robin\nWard\" recordings, including a duet with radio DJ [Wink\nMartindale](/wiki/Wink_Martindale \"Wink Martindale\"), another Dot Records\nartist. In 1964 Ward released the single \"Winter's Here\", which reached #123\non the Billboard chart. Because \"Wonderful Summer\" is her only Hot 100 hit,\nthe singer named Robin Ward is considered a one-hit-wonder. However, while the\npublic did not know Jackie's real name, many of her other recordings were and\nstill are widely heard.\n\n### Post \"Robin Ward\" TV, movies, and records\nsinging[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robin_Ward_\\(singer\\)&action=edit&section=4&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Post \"Robin Ward\" TV, movies, and records singing\")]\n\nAs her young-sounding Robin Ward records were disappearing from radio play,\nJackie Ward's grown-up singing career was expanding. At times in 1960s-1970s\nshe could be heard almost everywhere.\n\nIn the early to mid-1960s Jackie was one of the singers on _[The Red Skelton\nShow](/wiki/The_Red_Skelton_Show \"The Red Skelton Show\")_ and _[The Danny Kaye\nShow](/wiki/The_Danny_Kaye_Show \"The Danny Kaye Show\")_ , and later, on _[The\nCarol Burnett Show](/wiki/The_Carol_Burnett_Show \"The Carol Burnett Show\")_.\nIn the 1970s she sang on _[The Sonny& Cher Comedy\nHour](/wiki/The_Sonny_%26_Cher_Comedy_Hour \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\")_.\n\nWard sang in hundreds of commercials, most notably for [Rice-a-\nRoni](/wiki/Rice-a-Roni \"Rice-a-Roni\") (\"The San Francisco treat\").\n\nWard's voice is heard in dozens of television theme songs, including\n_[Flipper](/wiki/Flipper_\\(1964_TV_series\\) \"Flipper \\(1964 TV series\\)\")_ ,\n_[Batman](/wiki/Batman_\\(TV_series\\) \"Batman \\(TV series\\)\")_ , _[Love,\nAmerican Style](/wiki/Love,_American_Style \"Love, American Style\")_ ,\n_[Maude](/wiki/Maude_\\(TV_series\\) \"Maude \\(TV series\\)\")_ (with [Donny\nHathaway](/wiki/Donny_Hathaway \"Donny Hathaway\") providing the lead vocal),\nand _[The Partridge Family](/wiki/The_Partridge_Family \"The Partridge\nFamily\")_.\n\nBy her own estimate, Ward's voice can be heard in \"maybe 800\" films. Among the\nnotable are her voice dubbed as [Natalie Wood](/wiki/Natalie_Wood \"Natalie\nWood\") singing Academy Award-nominated song \"[Sweetheart\nTree](/w/index.php?title=Sweetheart_Tree&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Sweetheart\nTree \\(page does not exist\\)\")\" from movie _[The Great\nRace](/wiki/The_Great_Race \"The Great Race\")_ , as Wood in _[Inside Daisy\nClover](/wiki/Inside_Daisy_Clover \"Inside Daisy Clover\")_ , and as [Janet\nLeigh](/wiki/Janet_Leigh \"Janet Leigh\") in _[An American\nDream](/wiki/An_American_Dream_\\(film\\) \"An American Dream \\(film\\)\")_. Ward\nis the singing voice of [Cindy Bear](/wiki/Cindy_Bear \"Cindy Bear\") in _[Hey\nThere, It's Yogi Bear!](/wiki/Hey_There,_It%27s_Yogi_Bear! \"Hey There, It's\nYogi Bear!\")_, and the Singer in [_Charlotte 's\nWeb_](/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web_\\(1973_film\\) \"Charlotte's Web \\(1973 film\\)\").\nIn 1965 movie _[Beach Blanket Bingo](/wiki/Beach_Blanket_Bingo \"Beach Blanket\nBingo\")_ , Ward sings \"New Love\" and \"Fly Boy\", lip-synched by actor [Linda\nEvans](/wiki/Linda_Evans \"Linda Evans\").\n\nAlong with her TV, movie and advertising singing, Ward is heard on hundreds of\npop recordings, including backing [Barbra Streisand](/wiki/Barbra_Streisand\n\"Barbra Streisand\") on \"[Stoney End](/wiki/Stoney_End_\\(song\\) \"Stoney End\n\\(song\\)\")\". and other major recording artists including [Nat King\nCole](/wiki/Nat_King_Cole \"Nat King Cole\"), [Bing Crosby](/wiki/Bing_Crosby\n\"Bing Crosby\"), [Frank Sinatra](/wiki/Frank_Sinatra \"Frank Sinatra\"), [Gordon\nLightfoot](/wiki/Gordon_Lightfoot \"Gordon Lightfoot\"), [the\nCarpenters](/wiki/The_Carpenters \"The Carpenters\"), [Cass\nElliot](/wiki/Cass_Elliot \"Cass Elliot\"), and [Joan Baez](/wiki/Joan_Baez\n\"Joan Baez\"). Ward did broadcast recordings of musicals _Hair_ , _Grease_ ,\n_Annie_ , and _Hello Dolly_. Ward sang a duet with Allan Sherman on his song\n_Here 's To the Crabgrass_ from his 1963 comedy album _My Son The Nut_. In\n1967, she sang on [Gábor Szabó](/wiki/G%C3%A1bor_Szab%C3%B3 \"Gábor Szabó\")'s\nalbum for Impulse!, _Wind, Sky And Diamonds_ , as a member of The California\nDreamers.\n\nWard also sang alto in vocal groups heard on many hit records and popular\nalbums, including [the Anita Kerr Singers](/wiki/The_Anita_Kerr_Singers \"The\nAnita Kerr Singers\") and [the Ron Hicklin\nSingers](/wiki/The_Ron_Hicklin_Singers \"The Ron Hicklin Singers\") (who\nanonymously made many hit records beyond the Partridge Family). As a member of\n[the Ray Conniff Singers](/wiki/The_Ray_Conniff_Singers \"The Ray Conniff\nSingers\"), Ward recorded several lead and solo vocals.\n\n### The Partridge\nFamily[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robin_Ward_\\(singer\\)&action=edit&section=5&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: The Partridge Family\")]\n\nWard's longest-lasting contribution might be _[The Partridge\nFamily](/wiki/The_Partridge_Family \"The Partridge Family\")_ TV show and hit\nrecords, where she is heard but not seen or identified. Other than show star\n[David Cassidy](/wiki/David_Cassidy \"David Cassidy\") (and star [Shirley\nJones](/wiki/Shirley_Jones \"Shirley Jones\") on a couple of songs), none of the\nactors participated in singing or playing the songs; on camera they lip-synced\nand pretended to play instruments while the soundtrack is actually recordings\nby session musicians. Ward was in the Ron Hicklin Singers vocal group, along\nwith brothers [John Bahler](/wiki/John_Bahler \"John Bahler\") and [Tom\nBahler](/wiki/Tom_Bahler \"Tom Bahler\"), and [Ron Hicklin](/wiki/Ron_Hicklin\n\"Ron Hicklin\"). With Cassidy singing lead, this group did all the TV show\nperformances and records credited to the Partridge Family (along with session\ninstrumental musicians who became known as [the Wrecking\nCrew](/wiki/The_Wrecking_Crew_\\(music\\) \"The Wrecking Crew \\(music\\)\")). Since\nthe public did not know who really created the many Partridge Family songs\nthat became big hits, Ward again was anonymous.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robin_Ward_\\(singer\\)&action=edit&section=6&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"An Interview with Jackie Ward, part 1\"](http://www.cmongethappy.com/interviews/jw/index.html). _www.cmongethappy.com_.\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Crocodile Rock by Elton John Songfacts\"](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2037). _www.songfacts.com_.\n  3. **Jump up ^** Spectropop, Friends of.
