From 1946\nto [1949](/wiki/1949_in_sports \"1949 in sports\"), the Browns won each of the\nleague's four championships. The [National Football\nLeague](/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\") (NFL) does\nnot recognize the Browns' AAFC championships; however, the [Pro Football Hall\nof Fame](/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame \"Pro Football Hall of Fame\") _does_\nrecognize the team's championships, which is reflected in this list. When the\nAAFC folded in 1949, the Browns were absorbed into the NFL in\n[1950](/wiki/1950_NFL_season \"1950 NFL season\"). The Browns went on to win\nthree [NFL championships](/wiki/List_of_NFL_champions_\\(1920%E2%80%9369\\)\n\"List of NFL champions \\(1920–69\\)\"), nearly dominating the NFL in the 1950s,\nand won one more NFL championship in 1964. The team has yet to appear in a\n[Super Bowl](/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\"), however. Overall, the team has\nwon eight championships: four in the AAFC, and four in the NFL.\n\nIn [1996](/wiki/1996_NFL_season \"1996 NFL season\"), then-Browns owner [Art\nModell](/wiki/Art_Modell \"Art Modell\") made the decision to [move the\nteam](/wiki/Cleveland_Browns_relocation_controversy \"Cleveland Browns\nrelocation controversy\") from [Cleveland, Ohio](/wiki/Cleveland \"Cleveland\")\nto [Baltimore, Maryland](/wiki/Baltimore \"Baltimore\"). An agreement between\nthe city of Cleveland and the NFL kept the team's history, name and colors in\nCleveland, while Modell's new team would be regarded as an expansion team. The\n[Baltimore Ravens](/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens \"Baltimore Ravens\") would begin play\nin 1996, and the Browns would return to the league in\n[1999](/wiki/1999_NFL_season \"1999 NFL season\"). For record-keeping purposes,\nthe Browns are considered to have suspended operations from 1996 to 1998,\nwhich is reflected in this list. The Cleveland Browns are the second team in\nNFL History to reach an 0-16 record.\n\n  * _For a complete team history, see[History of the Cleveland Browns](/wiki/History_of_the_Cleveland_Browns
