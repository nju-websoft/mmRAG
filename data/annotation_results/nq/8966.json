A faulty temperature sensor was replaced, and inspection\nverified the engine had not been damaged in that incident.[76]\n\nOn January 21, the NTSB found evidence of soft-body damage in the right engine\nalong with organic debris including a feather.[77][78] The left engine also\nevidenced soft body impact, with: \"dents on both the spinner and inlet lip of\nthe engine cowling. Five booster inlet guide vanes are fractured and eight\noutlet guide vanes are missing.\" Both engines, missing large portions of their\nhousings,[79] were sent to the manufacturer for examination.[80] On January\n31, the plane was moved to [Kearny, New Jersey](/wiki/Kearny,_New_Jersey\n\"Kearny, New Jersey\"). The bird remains[76][81] were later identified by\n[DNA](/wiki/DNA \"DNA\") testing to be [Canada geese](/wiki/Canada_geese \"Canada\ngeese\"), which typically weigh more than engines are designed to withstand\ningesting.[76]\n\nBecause the plane was assembled in France[82] the [European Aviation Safety\nAgency](/wiki/European_Aviation_Safety_Agency \"European Aviation Safety\nAgency\") (the European counterpart of the FAA) and the [Bureau d'Enquêtes et\nd'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation\nCivile](/wiki/Bureau_d%27Enqu%C3%AAtes_et_d%27Analyses_pour_la_S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9_de_l%27Aviation_Civile\n\"Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile\") (the\nFrench counterpart of the NTSB) joined the investigation, with technical\nassistance from Airbus Industrie and GE Aviation/Snecma, respectively the\nmanufacturers of the airframe and the engines.[83][84]\n\nThe NTSB used [flight simulators](/wiki/Flight_simulators \"Flight simulators\")\nto test the possibility that the flight could have returned safely to\nLaGuardia or diverted to Teterboro; only seven of the thirteen simulated\nreturns to La Guardia succeeded, and only one of the two to Teterboro.[85]\nFurthermore, the NTSB report called these simulations unrealistic: \"The\nimmediate turn made by the pilots during the simulations did not reflect or\naccount for real-world considerations.\" A further simulation, conducted with\nthe pilot delayed by 35 seconds, crashed.[86] In testimony before the NTSB,\nSullenberger maintained that there had been no time to bring the plane to any\nairport, and that attempting to do so would likely have killed those onboard\nand more on the ground.[87]\n\nThe Board ultimately ruled that Sullenberger had made the correct\ndecision,[87] reasoning that the checklist for dual-engine failure is designed\nfor higher altitudes, when pilots have more time to deal with the situation,\nand that while simulations showed that the plane might have just barely made\nit back to LaGuardia, those scenarios assumed an instant decision to do so,\nwith no time allowed for assessing the situation.[88][89]\n\nThe NTSB concluded its investigation on May 4, 2010, identifying the probable\ncause as \"the ingestion of large birds into each engine, which resulted in an\nalmost total loss of thrust in both engines.\"[86] The final report credited\nthe outcome to four factors: good decision-making and teamwork by the cockpit\ncrew (including decisions to immediately turn on the\n[APU](/wiki/Auxiliary_power_unit \"Auxiliary power unit\") and to ditch in the\nHudson); the fact that the A320 is [certified for extended overwater\noperation](/wiki/ETOPS \"ETOPS\") (and hence carried life vests and additional\nraft/slides) even though not required for that route; the performance of the\nflight crew during the evacuation; and the proximity of working vessels to the\nditching site. Contributing factors were good visibility and a fast response\nfrom the ferry operators and emergency responders. The report also makes a\nrange of recommendations to improve safety in such situations.[2]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/N106US_aviation_museum.jpg/220px-N106US_aviation_museum.jpg)](/wiki/File:N106US_aviation_museum.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:N106US_aviation_museum.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nN106US on display at [Carolinas Aviation\nMuseum](/wiki/Carolinas_Aviation_Museum \"Carolinas Aviation Museum\").\n\nAuthor and pilot [William Langewiesche](/wiki/William_Langewiesche \"William\nLangewiesche\") asserted that insufficient credit was given to the A320's [fly-\nby-wire](/wiki/Fly-by-wire \"Fly-by-wire\") design, by which the pilot uses a\n[side-stick](/wiki/Side-stick \"Side-stick\") to make control inputs to the\nflight control computers. The computers then impose adjustments and limits of\ntheir own to keep the plane stable, which the pilot cannot override even in an\nemergency. This design allowed the pilots of Flight 1549 to concentrate on\nengine restart and deciding the course, without the burden of manually\nadjusting the glidepath to reduce the plane's rate of descent.[50]\nSullenberger said that these computer-imposed limits also prevented him from\nachieving the optimum [landing flare](/wiki/Landing_flare \"Landing flare\") for\nthe ditching, which would have softened the impact.[90]\n\nIn 2010, the damaged plane (excluding its engines)[91] was acquired for the\n[Carolinas Aviation Museum](/wiki/Carolinas_Aviation_Museum \"Carolinas\nAviation Museum\") in [Charlotte, North\nCarolina](/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina \"Charlotte, North Carolina\"),[92]\nwhich held a reception on June 11 to commemorate the arrival in Charlotte of\nthe plane's body, with Sullenberger as keynote speaker and the passengers\ninvited.[93][94][95][96]\n\n## Crew awards and\nhonors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=US_Airways_Flight_1549&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Crew awards and honors\")]\n\nThe reactions of all members of the crew, the split second decision making and\nthe handling of this emergency and evacuation was \"text book\" and an example\nto us all.
