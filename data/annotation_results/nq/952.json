In addition, the series introduced a second means\nof voting for viewers in the form of [mobile short codes](/wiki/Short_code\n\"Short code\") \\- each participant received one during the show would could be\ncalled from any phone, with a small portion of the phone-in fee being donated\nto charity. Unlike _[The X Factor](/wiki/The_X_Factor_\\(UK\\) \"The X Factor\n\\(UK\\)\")_ , text voting via this method was not incorporated, due to the\npotential risk of delays within the mobile text networks at busy times.[9]\n\nThe sixth series was won by dancing dog act [Ashleigh and\nPudsey](/wiki/Ashleigh_and_Pudsey \"Ashleigh and Pudsey\"), with opera duo\n[Jonathan and Charlotte](/wiki/Jonathan_and_Charlotte \"Jonathan and\nCharlotte\") finishing in second place and Welsh choir [Only Boys\nAloud](/wiki/Only_Boys_Aloud \"Only Boys Aloud\") in third place. During its\nbroadcast, the series averaged around 10.6 million viewers. In an interview\nthey took part in, hosts [Ant & Dec](/wiki/Ant_%26_Dec \"Ant & Dec\") felt that\nthis year's semi-finalists were the best they had seen since the show\nbegan.[10]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Series overview\n    * 1.1 Semi-finals summary\n      * 1.1.1 Semi-final 1 (6 May)\n      * 1.1.2 Semi-final 2 (7 May)\n      * 1.1.3 Semi-final 3 (8 May)\n      * 1.1.4 Semi-final 4 (9 May)\n      * 1.1.5 Semi-final 5 (10 May)\n    * 1.2 Final (12 May)\n  * 2 Ratings\n  * 3 Criticism, controversies & incidents\n    * 3.1 Unsuitable content complaint\n    * 3.2 \"Conflict of interest\" audition\n    * 3.3 Voting app mishap\n  * 4 References\n\n## Series\noverview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Britain%27s_Got_Talent_\\(series_6\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Series overview\")]\n\n[![Judge](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Alesha_Dixon_4.jpg/129px-\nAlesha_Dixon_4.jpg)](/wiki/File:Alesha_Dixon_4.jpg)\n\n[![Judge](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/David_Walliams.JPG/141px-\nDavid_Walliams.JPG)](/wiki/File:David_Walliams.JPG)\n\nThe departure of McIntyre and Hasselhoff, led to Dixon and Walliams being made\nas their replacements at the start of 2012\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Carmen_Electra_2013.jpg/150px-\nCarmen_Electra_2013.jpg)](/wiki/File:Carmen_Electra_2013.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Carmen_Electra_2013.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBecause of Holden's pregnancy, Electra had to stand in for her during the\nBlackpool auditions\n\nFollowing open auditions held the previous year,[11][12] the Judges' auditions\nwere held during January and February 2012, within\n[Manchester](/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\"),[13] [Blackpool](/wiki/Blackpool\n\"Blackpool\"), [Cardiff](/wiki/Cardiff \"Cardiff\"), [London](/wiki/London\n\"London\"), [Edinburgh](/wiki/Edinburgh \"Edinburgh\") and\n[Birmingham](/wiki/Birmingham \"Birmingham\"). Like the previous series, a\nnumber of acts were invited to audition between 6 and 22 January, after being\nfound via their videos on [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\").[14] Twenty-five\nparticipants from this were picked by the producers and revealed by _Britain\n's Got More Talent_ host [Stephen Mulhern](/wiki/Stephen_Mulhern \"Stephen\nMulhern\") via a live YouTube stream from backstage at the London auditions, in\nwhich the YouTube community voted on their favourites between 6 and 13\nFebruary, with the winning acts later performing before the judges after the\nresults of the vote on 18 February. Between 25 and 31 January, the sponsors of\nthe show for this series, Virgin Media, ran addition auditions for the show\nvia videos made on YouTube and/or [Vimeo](/wiki/Vimeo \"Vimeo\"), which, while\nadhering to the same rules, were restricted to only Virgin Media customer,\nwith the five winning acts later performing for the judges during the\nBirmingham auditions.\n\nFollowing the previous series, both [David Hasselhoff](/wiki/David_Hasselhoff\n\"David Hasselhoff\") and [Michael McIntyre](/wiki/Michael_McIntyre \"Michael\nMcIntyre\") announced that they wouldn't be returning for another year of the\ncompetition.[3][4] Their decision led to the producers seeking out their\nreplacements, after deciding to maintain the use of four judges in the\nprogramme following Cowell's announcement in December 2011 that he would be\nreturning to oversee auditions for the sixth series. Both Hasselhoff and\nMcIntyre were eventually replaced by comedian [David\nWalliams](/wiki/David_Walliams \"David Walliams\"), and singer and TV presenter\n[Alesha Dixon](/wiki/Alesha_Dixon \"Alesha Dixon\"), the latter having\npreviously been a judge on [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\")'s [Strictly Come\nDancing](/wiki/Strictly_Come_Dancing \"Strictly Come Dancing\").[5] Owing to her\npregnancy entering its late stages, Holden was forced to be absent from the\nBlackpool auditions.[6] As a result, the production team brought in [Carmen\nElectra](/wiki/Carmen_Electra \"Carmen Electra\") as a guest judge and oversee\nthese in her place, until Holden was cleared by doctors to return to\noverseeing the remainder of the auditions.[7][15] Apart from a change in the\njudging panel, the producers decided to increase the prize money offered to\nthe winner of the series to £500,000, with Cowell pledging half of the prize\nmoney.[8]\n\nOf the participants that took part, only forty five made it past this stage\nand into the five live semi-finals,[16] with nine appearing in each one; this\nwas a significant change after the last four series of the programme. In a\nchange with the format, the live final featured ten acts that made it through\nthe semi-finals, and one additional act dubbed \"the Judges' wildcard\" \\- if a\nsemi-finalist was eliminated in their semi-final, they became eligible to be\npicked as a wildcard act for the final by the judges, with the choice made\nprior to the live final's broadcast. The wildcard for this series was boyband\n[The Mend](/wiki/The_Mend_\\(band\\) \"The Mend \\(band\\)\"), after they lost out\nin the tied Judges' vote in the first semi-final.

content\ncomplaint[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Britain%27s_Got_Talent_\\(series_6\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Unsuitable content complaint\")]\n\nAfter the second audition episode had been aired, around over 70 complaints\nwere made to [Ofcom](/wiki/Ofcom \"Ofcom\") in regards to the performance of\nburlesque performer Beatrix Von Bourbon. Their criticism was over her\naudition, which involved stripping down until she wore only nipple tassels and\na corset, which these viewers had felt to be unsuitable for a family show,\nespecially as it had been shown before the [9pm\nwatershed](/wiki/Watershed_\\(broadcasting\\) \"Watershed \\(broadcasting\\)\").[34]\nIn its defence to this criticism, ITV released a statement in which they\npointed out that the footage that was aired had been \"carefully edited to\nensure it was suitable\". Ofcom launched an investigation into the matter which\nran until 23 July 2012, in which, based on their findings, the regulator ruled\nthat the broadcaster had not breached broadcasting codes that concerned the\nprotection of children from unsuitable material, stating that the measures\ntaken by the broadcaster had been within acceptable parameters of these\ncodes.[35]\n\n### \"Conflict of interest\"\naudition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Britain%27s_Got_Talent_\\(series_6\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: \"Conflict of interest\" audition\")]\n\nAs part of the show's terms and conditions, stated in Section 23 regarding\naudition forms, all participants who audition for _Britain 's Got Talent_ must\nprovide truthful information about themselves. Such disclosure includes\ninformation about any other show they are contracted to appear on, which would\nprohibit them from progressing beyond the auditions stage of the competition.\nWhile checking his background, researchers discovered that when\nsinger/guitarist [Ryan O'Shaughnessy](/wiki/Ryan_O%27Shaughnessy \"Ryan\nO'Shaughnessy\") had auditioned, he was already in a contract with [Universal\nMusic](/wiki/Universal_Music_Group \"Universal Music Group\") and had a place on\nthe [first series](/wiki/The_Voice_of_Ireland_\\(series_1\\) \"The Voice of\nIreland \\(series 1\\)\") of _[The Voice of Ireland](/wiki/The_Voice_of_Ireland\n\"The Voice of Ireland\")_ that was airing the same year as the sixth series of\nthe show. This discovery led to [Simon Cowell](/wiki/Simon_Cowell \"Simon\nCowell\") having to talk to O'Shaughnessy on his own and pointing out the\nresearcher's findings to him, to which the singer stated in his defence that\nhe wanted the freedom to express his own music that the competition show could\ngive him, which _The Voice of Ireland_ restricted. However, Cowell did not\nagree with his argument:[36][37][38]\n\n> \"All you're doing is taking the place of somebody else, who isn't in your\n> position on two shows. I'll be absolutely blunt with you, we were going to\n> give you a yes, but I can't... you understand that?\"\n\nO'Shaughnessy, while accepting this decision, insisted he would do what he\ncould to get out of _The Voice of Ireland_ and out of his contract with\nUniversal Music, which he successfully completed before the live semi-finals\nbegan on 6 May.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Voting app\nmishap[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Britain%27s_Got_Talent_\\(series_6\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Voting app mishap\")]\n\nFor this series of _Britain 's Got Talent_, the show's production team decided\nto incorporate a second new method of voting that viewers could use, in the\nform of a mobile app. The concept for this idea was that viewers could\npurchase a set of three votes for a small fee and then use them, via the app,\nfor any act that they liked in the semi-finals; any votes not used in one show\nwould be carried forward to the next, and once all three votes had been used,\nthe viewer would have to buy another set to place further votes. However, when\nthis voting method was implemented for the first live semi-final, technical\ndifficulties arose that led to use of the app being halted; as the problems\ncould not be fixed after they arose, the decision was made to discontinue its\nuse for the rest of the series. [Ofcom](/wiki/Ofcom \"Ofcom\") later\ninvestigated the incident, after thousands of viewers who bought the app later\ncomplained to the regulator of their difficulties in using it to make votes,\nas over the half of the votes did not go through as a result of the technical\nfault. In their findings, the regulator reprimanded ITV for having failed to\nensure that the app worked smoothly upon its activation, adding:\n\n> \"We were therefore concerned that the application was unable to handle\n> demand when voting opened. This meant that a significant proportion of\n> viewers who had responded to the programme's invitation to purchase voting\n> credits via the app were unable to use them and that therefore viewers were\n> effectively misled - albeit unintentionally. We expect licensees to take all\n> steps and efforts that are reasonably practicable to ensure the integrity\n> and robustness of the systems they use.\"\n\nHowever, Ofcom acknowledged that the concept of voting via smartphones was an\noriginal idea and that ITV was not at fault for the technical issues that\narose from its use, while commending the broadcaster for providing sufficient\naction to deal with the aftermath of the fault.[39]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Britain%27s_Got_Talent_\\(series_6\\)&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Littlejohn, Georgina (7 March 2012).
