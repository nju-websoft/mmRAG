In\n1929, B.L. \"Crook\" Smith, a sports standout from [Mercer\nUniversity](/wiki/Mercer_University \"Mercer University\"), was hired as\nfootball coach and athletics director and would lead the football team for 13\nseasons. Football was suspended in 1941 at the outset of World War II and\nwould not return for 41 years.\n\n### Erk Russell era:\n1981–1989[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Erk Russell era: 1981–1989\")]\n\nIn 1978, President Dale Lick decided that football should be revived at\nGeorgia Southern College. Despite a faculty senate vote against renewing the\nsport, Lick worked to generate support for the endeavor. In 1982, the school\nhired [Erk Russell](/wiki/Erk_Russell \"Erk Russell\"), the popular and\ncharismatic defensive coordinator at the [University of\nGeorgia](/wiki/University_of_Georgia \"University of Georgia\"), to coach the\nnew football team. On the hire, humorist [Lewis Grizzard](/wiki/Lewis_Grizzard\n\"Lewis Grizzard\") said, \"When they landed Erk Russell, they got themselves a\nfranchise.\"[3] The Eagles fielded a club team in 1982 and 1983 and began\nofficial [NCAA](/wiki/NCAA \"NCAA\") Division I-AA play in 1984. The next year,\nthe Eagles would win their first Division I-AA national championship in\n[Tacoma, Washington](/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington \"Tacoma, Washington\"), defeating\n[Furman University](/wiki/Furman_University \"Furman University\"), in only the\nteam's fourth year in existence, second as a varsity team. The Eagles would\nreturn to Tacoma the next year and win the championship vs. [Arkansas\nState](/wiki/Arkansas_State_University \"Arkansas State University\"). In 1989,\nthe Eagles became the first college team to go 15–0 in the 20th century,\nwinning the national championship on their home field vs. [Stephen F.\nAustin](/wiki/Stephen_F._Austin \"Stephen F. Austin\"). Soon after the game,\nRussell retired.\n\n### Tim Stowers era:\n1990–1996[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Tim Stowers era: 1990–1996\")]\n\n[Tim Stowers](/wiki/Tim_Stowers \"Tim Stowers\") was hired to succeed Russell\nafter Georgia Southern's 1989 (15–0) national title. Stowers was the 1989\noffensive coordinator, one of only two coordinators since 1900 to direct an\noffense of a team with a 15–0 record. However, Stowers was never able to live\nup to the expectations set by Russell and was fired in 1995 after a 9–4\nrecord, ranked as one of top 8 teams in 1995 (lost at\n[Montana](/wiki/University_of_Montana \"University of Montana\") the eventual\nI-AA/FCS National Champion and beat No. 1-ranked [Troy State](/wiki/Troy_State\n\"Troy State\") 11–0 on the road), by new athletics director Sam Baker, who\nnever saw Stowers coach a game. Stowers had an overall record of 51–23 (.689)\nvs. FCS/I-AA opponents. FBS/D-IA losses-[Miami](/wiki/University_of_Miami\n\"University of Miami\") Hurricanes twice, Georgia Bulldogs,\n[Auburn](/wiki/Auburn_University \"Auburn University\") Tigers, and [Bobby\nBowden](/wiki/Bobby_Bowden \"Bobby Bowden\") and [Florida\nState](/wiki/Florida_State_University \"Florida State University\") Seminoles.\nStowers had a 6–2 playoff record and a 51–18 (.739) overall record vs.\nI-AA/FCS opponents and lower. Stowers won the 1990 I-AA national championship\n(12–3) and was named AFCA Kodak National Coach of the Year. He also won\nGeorgia Southern's first Southern Conference Title in 1993 (first year in the\nleague) and was named 1993 Southern Conference Coach of the Year. He was\nsucceeded by interim coach [Frank Ellwood](/wiki/Frank_Ellwood \"Frank\nEllwood\") for one year. The 1996 season was the first losing season in the\nmodern era as the Eagles fell to 4–7.\n\n### Paul Johnson era:\n1997–2001[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Paul Johnson era: 1997–2001\")]\n\nThe next coach for the Eagles was [Paul\nJohnson](/wiki/Paul_Johnson_\\(American_football_coach\\) \"Paul Johnson\n\\(American football coach\\)\"). Johnson found instant success, taking the\nEagles to the playoffs in his first season. He, along with Eagle legend\n[Adrian N. Peterson](/wiki/Adrian_N._Peterson \"Adrian N. Peterson\"), reached\nthe 1998 national championship. However, the Eagles lost the game to the\n[University of Massachusetts](/wiki/UMass \"UMass\") 55–43 in [Chattanooga,\nTennessee](/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee \"Chattanooga, Tennessee\"). The Eagles\nrebounded under Johnson and won back-to-back national championships in 1999\n(vs. [Youngstown State](/wiki/Youngstown_State_University \"Youngstown State\nUniversity\")) and 2000 (vs. [Montana](/wiki/University_of_Montana \"University\nof Montana\")). Both games were played in Chattanooga, Tenn. After the 2001\nseason, Johnson resigned to become the head coach of [Navy](/wiki/USNA\n\"USNA\").\n\n### Post-Johnson era:\n2002–2009[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Post-Johnson era: 2002–2009\")]\n\nJohnson was succeeded by Mike Sewak. Despite winning the Southern Conference\nchampionship twice in his tenure, his lack of postseason success as well as a\nfalling out with former head coach Erk Russell led to his firing after the\n[2005 season](/wiki/2005_Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football_team \"2005 Georgia\nSouthern Eagles football team\"). [Brian VanGorder](/wiki/Brian_VanGorder\n\"Brian VanGorder\"), a former defensive coordinator at the University of\nGeorgia, was hired to succeed Sewak. In the first of many controversial moves,\nVanGorder scrapped Georgia Southern's famed triple-option offense and did away\nwith certain traditions, such as the team's arrival at home games on yellow\nschool buses. Erk Russell had also died unexpectedly of a stroke on the eve\nthe first game of the [2006\nseason](/wiki/2006_Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football_team \"2006 Georgia\nSouthern Eagles football team\") after addressing the team on the night before.\nVanGorder led the team to a 3–8 record, the worst record at the time in the\nmodern era of Georgia Southern football. After his unsatisfactory one year as\ncoach, VanGorder left to take a position with the [Atlanta\nFalcons](/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons \"Atlanta Falcons\"). Chris Hatcher, formerly the\nhead coach at [Valdosta State University](/wiki/Valdosta_State_University\n\"Valdosta State University\"), which he led to the 2004 [NCAA Division II\nFootball Championship](/wiki/NCAA_Division_II_National_Football_Championship\n\"NCAA Division II National Football Championship\"), was named the new head\ncoach on January 19, 2007. Hatcher led the Eagles back to a winning record\nwith a 7–4 finish, barely missing the playoffs. However, Hatcher could not\nreplicate the success of his first season, going 11–11 in the following two\nseasons. He was dismissed after the conclusion of the [2009\nseason](/wiki/2009_Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football_team \"2009 Georgia\nSouthern Eagles football team\"), the team's third modern era season with a\nlosing record at 5–6, and the second within four years.\n\n### Jeff Monken era and final years in the FCS:\n2010–2013[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Jeff Monken era and final years in the FCS: 2010–2013\")]\n\nOn November 29, 2009, school officials announced that Jeff Monken, a longtime\nassistant coach under Paul Johnson, would become the next head coach of the\nEagles. Monken's hiring signaled the return of the triple-option offense which\nbrought success to the program in years past. In Monken's [first\nyear](/wiki/2010_Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football_team \"2010 Georgia Southern\nEagles football team\"), the Eagles finished the regular season with a 7–4\nrecord and made their first playoff appearance since 2005, advancing to the\n[semifinals](/wiki/2010_NCAA_Division_I_FCS_football_season#NCAA_FCS_Playoff_bracket\n\"2010 NCAA Division I FCS football season\"), where the Eagles fell to the\n[Delaware Blue Hens](/wiki/Delaware_Fightin%27_Blue_Hens_football \"Delaware\nFightin' Blue Hens football\").\n\nDuring the [2011 season](/wiki/2011_Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football_team\n\"2011 Georgia Southern Eagles football team\"), Georgia Southern was ranked No.\n1 in the FCS for the first time since the 2001 season.[4] Additionally,\nGeorgia Southern clinched the Southern Conference [Football\nChampionship](/wiki/List_of_Southern_Conference_football_champions \"List of\nSouthern Conference football champions\") for the first time since 2004 and\nfirst time outright since 2002.[5] The Eagles finished the 2011 regular season\nwith a 9–2 record; however, they were ousted in the\n[semifinals](/wiki/2011_NCAA_Division_I_FCS_football_season#NCAA_FCS_Playoff_bracket\n\"2011 NCAA Division I FCS football season\") for a second straight year by the\neventual FCS champion [North Dakota State\nBison](/wiki/2011_North_Dakota_State_Bison_football_team \"2011 North Dakota\nState Bison football team\"). In the [2012\nseason](/wiki/2012_Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football_team \"2012 Georgia\nSouthern Eagles football team\"), the Eagles finished the regular season with\nan 8–3 record with a share of the Southern Conference Championship; however,\nthe Eagles fell for a third straight time in what was ultimately the team's\nfinal FCS playoff game in the [FCS\nsemifinals](/wiki/2012_NCAA_Division_I_FCS_football_season#NCAA_FCS_Playoff_bracket\n\"2012 NCAA Division I FCS football season\"), losing a rematch of the previous\nyear's semifinal game against [North Dakota\nState](/wiki/2012_North_Dakota_State_Bison_football_team \"2012 North Dakota\nState Bison football team\"). In the team's [final FCS\nseason](/wiki/2013_Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football_team \"2013 Georgia\nSouthern Eagles football team\"), the Eagles compiled a 7–4 record. In the\nfinal game of that season, the Eagles earned an upset win over the [Florida\nGators](/wiki/2013_Florida_Gators_football_team \"2013 Florida Gators football\nteam\") 26–20, the team's first win over an FBS opponent in 21 tries. On\nDecember 24, 2013, Monken resigned to become the next head coach of the [Army\nBlack Knights](/wiki/Army_Black_Knights_football \"Army Black Knights\nfootball\").[6][7]\n\n### Willie Fritz era and the start of FBS play:\n2014–2015[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Willie Fritz era and the start of FBS play: 2014–2015\")]\n\nAfter years of rumors and fan speculation, Georgia Southern announced its\nintentions to move to the Football Bowl Subdivision level in April 2012. The\nuniversity plans to raise $36.6 million over eight years to accommodate the\nmove. Paulson Stadium will be expanded to FBS-standards by constructing a\n57,000 square feet (5,295 m2) football operations center in the eastern end of\nthe stadium and adding 6,300 seats on the north stands.[8] Additionally,\nstudents voted in favor of raising student athletic fees by $100 to\naccommodate the move. $25 of the fee increase will be used for the stadium\nexpansion project while the remaining $75 is implemented as the \"FBS Fee\".[9]\n\nOn July 27, 2012, then-Athletics Director Sam Baker resigned. Baker was an\nardent supporter of remaining in the FCS despite university president [Brooks\nKeel](/wiki/Brooks_Keel \"Brooks Keel\")'s proclamation, mainly due to the\nfinancial ramifications of moving to a higher level. On November 12, 2012,\nPresident Keel named Tom Kleinlein as athletics director.[10] On March 27,\n2013, Georgia Southern announced its move to the [Sun Belt\nConference](/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference \"Sun Belt Conference\") on July 1, 2014,\nbecoming bowl-eligible in 2015. In the 2013 season, Georgia Southern's\nfootball schedule remained the same, but it was ineligible for the Southern\nConference title as well as the FCS playoffs. The university paid the Southern\nConference $600,000 in exit fees.[11]\n\nOn January 10, 2014, [Willie Fritz](/wiki/Willie_Fritz \"Willie Fritz\"),\nformerly the head coach of the [Sam Houston State\nBearkats](/wiki/Sam_Houston_State_Bearkats_football \"Sam Houston State\nBearkats football\"), was named as the Eagles' ninth modern era head coach and\nfirst of the FBS era.[12] In the Eagles' [first FBS\nseason](/wiki/2014_Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football_team \"2014 Georgia\nSouthern Eagles football team\"), the team finished the season 9–3 overall and\nwas undefeated in Sun Belt Conference play at 8–0, winning the outright\nconference championship. The Eagles became only the third team ever to win a\nconference title in its first FBS season, after\n[Nevada](/wiki/Nevada_Wolf_Pack_football \"Nevada Wolf Pack football\") in 1992\n([Big West Conference](/wiki/Big_West_Conference \"Big West Conference\")) and\n[Marshall in 1997](/wiki/1997_Marshall_Thundering_Herd_football_team \"1997\nMarshall Thundering Herd football team\") ([Mid-American Conference](/wiki/Mid-\nAmerican_Conference \"Mid-American Conference\")). They were also the first team\never to go unbeaten in conference play in their first FBS season.[13] Since\nthe Eagles were under transitional status, the university filed for a\npostseason waiver to allow the Eagles to play in a bowl game; however, the\nNCAA denied Georgia Southern's waiver request and a subsequent appeal since\nenough \"full member\" FBS teams became bowl-eligible during the season. In the\n[2015 season](/wiki/2015_Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football_team \"2015 Georgia\nSouthern Eagles football team\"), Fritz led the Eagles to a 8-4 record,\nreceiving their first bowl bid to the [GoDaddy\nBowl](/wiki/2015_GoDaddy_Bowl_\\(December\\) \"2015 GoDaddy Bowl \\(December\\)\")\non December 23, 2015 against [Bowling Green](/wiki/Bowling_Green_Falcons\n\"Bowling Green Falcons\").\n\nOn December 11, 2015, Fritz resigned as the Eagles head coach to accept the\nhead coaching position at [Tulane University](/wiki/Tulane_Green_Wave_football\n\"Tulane Green Wave football\").[14] Assistant head coach and running backs\ncoach Dell McGee was appointed as interim head coach for the GoDaddy Bowl\ngame, where Georgia Southern defeated Bowling Green 58–27.\n\n### Post-Fritz era:\n2016–present[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Post-Fritz era: 2016–present\")]\n\n[Tyson Summers](/wiki/Tyson_Summers \"Tyson Summers\") was hired on December 21,\n2015 to succeed Fritz.

However, the school has gone by a number of different nicknames. From\nas early as 1907 the teams of the then First District A&M school were referred\nto as the Culture to reflect the agricultural background of the school.[19]\nFrom 1924 to 1941, the nickname was the Blue Tide. After World War II,\nathletic teams were referred to as the Professors reflecting the school's\nstatus as a teacher-training college. However, in 1959 when the school was\nrenamed Georgia Southern College, a student vote was held to determine the new\n[mascot](/wiki/Mascot \"Mascot\"); among the 104 entries, voters chose Eagles\nover Colonels by a narrow margin. In 1997, a contest was held to select the\nofficial name of the mascot, incoming freshman Imen Edmond and Heidi Barber\nwon with the name GUS.[20]\n\n### Beautiful Eagle\nCreek[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Beautiful Eagle Creek\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Eagle_Creek_%28Georgia%29.jpg/220px-\nEagle_Creek_%28Georgia%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Eagle_Creek_\\(Georgia\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Eagle_Creek_\\(Georgia\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBeautiful Eagle Creek\n\nWhen Georgia Southern resurrected football in 1981, it lacked tradition. A\ndrainage ditch that the team had to cross several times a day during football\npractice came to be called Beautiful Eagle Creek by Coach Erk Russell. When\nthe Eagles traveled to Northern Iowa during the 1985 playoffs, Russell took\nalong a jug of this Eagle Creek water to sprinkle on the field.\n\n### The Hugo\nBowl[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: The Hugo Bowl\")]\n\nIn 1989 ESPN was to broadcast a Thursday Night Football game between Georgia\nSouthern and the [Middle Tennessee State Blue\nRaiders](/wiki/Middle_Tennessee_State_Blue_Raiders \"Middle Tennessee State\nBlue Raiders\"). However, [Hurricane Hugo](/wiki/Hurricane_Hugo \"Hurricane\nHugo\"), a category 4 storm, was headed straight toward the coast of Georgia.\nHugo ranked as the 11th most intense hurricane at time of landfall to strike\nthe United States this century, with the highest ever recorded storm surge on\nthe East Coast. Nevertheless, the decision was made to continue with the game.\nFor safety purposes, an open line was kept between the press box at Paulson\nStadium and the National Hurricane Center in Florida. The Eagles went on to\ndefeat MTSU by a score of 26–0 in a classic that will forever be known in\nEagle history as the Hugo Bowl.\n\nThis was the first night game played at Paulson Stadium. Temporary lighting\nwas used for the game because the stadium was not outfitted with permanent\nlighting until the 1994 season. Many feared that the booms used to hoist the\nstadium lights would tip over due to the heavy wind. While it was expected\ninitially to be a sellout crowd, due to the approaching storm the actual\nattendance was in the neighborhood of only 3,000.\n\n### Plain\nuniforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Plain uniforms\")]\n\nThe uniforms consist of plain white pants, blue helmets with a white stripe\ndown the middle and the player's number on the sides, and blue jerseys. This\nminimalist look was adopted more or less out of necessity. When the program\nwas revived in 1982, the school did not have a large budget. Indeed, the\nequipment budget was so limited that only plain white practice pants could be\npurchased. Hence, the practice pants doubled as game pants. Russell bought\nsolid blue helmets and had the players put a piece of tape down the\nmiddle.[21] With the subsequent success of the Eagles, the basic design has\nremained the same, with the only real changes in recent years being a white\nstripe down the middle of the helmets and the addition of names to the backs\nof the jerseys. Sports Illustrated has ranked the uniforms as being the third\nbest in college football.\n\n### Yellow school\nbuses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Southern_Eagles_football&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Yellow school buses\")]\n\nWhen the football program was restarted in 1981, money was tight. In fact,\nthere wasn't enough money to furnish transportation to home games. The\n[Bulloch County](/wiki/Bulloch_County \"Bulloch County\") school system sold two\nbuses for a dollar each to the team. The buses have been used by the team ever\nsince as transportation to [Allen E. Paulson Stadium](/wiki/Paulson_Stadium\n\"Paulson Stadium\"). This tradition continued even when the Eagles rose to\npowerhouse status. This briefly ended with the arrival of Brian VanGorder,\nfollowing his scrapping of the Eagles' triple-option rushing attack.
