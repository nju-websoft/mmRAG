The [Norse peoples](/wiki/Norse_peoples\n\"Norse peoples\") who came to the [British Isles](/wiki/British_Isles \"British\nIsles\") have been generally referred to as [Vikings](/wiki/Vikings\n\"Vikings\"),[1][2] but it is a matter of debate if the term _Viking_\nrepresented all Norse settlers or just those who raided.[3]\n\nAt the start of the Early Medieval period, Norse kingdoms of Scandinavia had\ndeveloped trade links across southern Europe and the Mediterranean, giving\nthem access to foreign imports such as silver, gold, bronze and spices. These\ntrade links also extended westward into Ireland and the British Isles.[4]\n\nIn the last decade of the 8th century AD, Norse raiders sacked a series of\nChristian monasteries located in what is now the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"), beginning in 793, with a raid\non the coastal monastery of [Lindisfarne](/wiki/Lindisfarne \"Lindisfarne\") on\nthe east coast of [England](/wiki/England_in_the_Middle_Ages \"England in the\nMiddle Ages\"). The following year they sacked the nearby [Monkwearmouth-Jarrow\nAbbey](/wiki/Monkwearmouth-Jarrow_Abbey \"Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey\"), and in\n795 they attacked again, raiding [Iona Abbey](/wiki/Iona_Abbey \"Iona Abbey\")\non [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland_in_the_Early_Middle_Ages \"Scotland in the Early\nMiddle Ages\")'s west coast.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n    * 1.1 Scandinavia\n  * 2 Viking raids: 793–850 AD\n    * 2.1 Treasure hoards\n  * 3 Invasion and Danelaw: 865–896\n    * 3.1 England\n    * 3.2 Norse settlement in the British Isles\n  * 4 Second invasion: 980–1012\n    * 4.1 England\n  * 5 Invasions of 1066\n  * 6 Evidence\n    * 6.1 Written records\n    * 6.2 Archaeological evidence\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n    * 8.1 Footnotes\n    * 8.2 Bibliography\n  * 9 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nDuring the Early Medieval period, Ireland and Britain were culturally,\nlinguistically and religiously divided into various peoples. The languages of\nthe [Celtic Britons](/wiki/Celtic_Britons \"Celtic Britons\") and\n[Gaels](/wiki/Gaels \"Gaels\") were descended from the [Celtic\nlanguages](/wiki/Celtic_languages \"Celtic languages\") spoken by those of [Iron\nAge](/wiki/Iron_Age \"Iron Age\") Europe. In [Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\"),\nparts of western [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\"), as well as the [Isle\nof Man](/wiki/Isle_of_Man \"Isle of Man\"), people were speaking an early form\nof [Gaelic](/wiki/Goidelic_languages \"Goidelic languages\") known as [Old\nIrish](/wiki/Old_Irish \"Old Irish\"). There may have been another [pre-Indo-\nEuropean](/wiki/Goidelic_substrate_hypothesis \"Goidelic substrate hypothesis\")\nlanguage spoken by the [Erainn](/wiki/Iverni \"Iverni\") up until the 8th\ncentury in what is today [Kerry](/wiki/County_Kerry \"County Kerry\"), but this\nis likely to have been Celtic or some other Indo-European language. In Western\nBritain, which includes; [Cornwall](/wiki/Cornwall \"Cornwall\"),\n[Cumbria](/wiki/Cumbria \"Cumbria\"), [Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\"), and\nSouthwest Scotland, the Celtic [Brythonic languages](/wiki/Brythonic_languages\n\"Brythonic languages\") were spoken, with modern descendants such as\n[Welsh](/wiki/Welsh_language \"Welsh language\") and\n[Cornish](/wiki/Cornish_language \"Cornish language\") still being used. In\nNorthern Britain, past the Forth and Clyde rivers which constitutes a large\nportion of modern-day Scotland, dwelled the Picts who spoke the\n[Pictish](/wiki/Pictish_Language \"Pictish Language\") language. Due to the\nscarcity of writing in Pictish, all of which can be found in\n[Ogham](/wiki/Ogham \"Ogham\"), views are conflicted as to whether Pictish was\nCeltic like the southernly languages, or perhaps even a non-Indo-European\nlanguage like [Basque](/wiki/Basque_Language \"Basque Language\"). However, most\ninscriptions and place names hint towards the Picts being Celtic in language\nand culture. Most peoples of Britain and Ireland had already predominantly\nconverted to [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity \"Christianity\") from their\nolder, pre-Christian [polytheistic](/wiki/Polytheism \"Polytheism\") religions.\nIn contrast to the rest of the isles though, much of southern Britain was\nconsidered to be part of [Anglo-Saxon England](/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_England\n\"Anglo-Saxon England\"), where [Anglo-Saxon](/wiki/Anglo-Saxons \"Anglo-Saxons\")\nmigrants from continental Europe had settled during the 5th century CE,\nbringing with them their own [Germanic language](/wiki/Germanic_languages\n\"Germanic languages\") (known as [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old\nEnglish\")), a polytheistic religion ([Anglo-Saxon paganism](/wiki/Anglo-\nSaxon_paganism \"Anglo-Saxon paganism\")) and their own distinct cultural\npractices. By the time of the Viking incursions though, Anglo-Saxon England\nhad too become mostly Christian.\n\nThe Isle of Man had supported its own agrarian population, but it is widely\nbelieved that it was Brythonic-speaking before Old Irish (later to become\n[Manx](/wiki/Manx_language \"Manx language\")) spread there.\n[Gaelicisation](/wiki/Gaelicisation \"Gaelicisation\") could have taken place\nbefore the Viking age or perhaps during it, when the area was settled by\nNorse-Gaels who practised their own culture.\n\nIn northern Britain, in the area roughly corresponding to modern-day Scotland,\nlived three distinct ethnic groups in their own respective kingdoms; the\n[Picts](/wiki/Picts \"Picts\"), [Scots](/wiki/Scottish_people \"Scottish people\")\nand [Britons](/wiki/Britons_\\(historical\\) \"Britons \\(historical\\)\").[6] The\nPictish cultural group dominated the majority of Scotland, with major\npopulations concentrated between the [Firth of Forth](/wiki/Firth_of_Forth\n\"Firth of Forth\") and the [River Dee](/wiki/River_Dee,_Aberdeenshire \"River\nDee, Aberdeenshire\"), as well as in [Sutherland](/wiki/Sutherland\n\"Sutherland\"), [Caithness](/wiki/Caithness \"Caithness\"), and\n[Orkney](/wiki/Orkney \"Orkney\").[7] The Scots were, according to written\nsources, a tribal group which had crossed to Britain from\n[Dalriada](/wiki/Dalriada \"Dalriada\") in the north of Ireland during the late\n5th century. Archaeologists have not been able to identify anything that was\nunique to the kingdom of the Scots, noting similarities with the Picts in most\nforms of material culture.[8] The Britons were those dwelling in the [Old\nNorth](/wiki/Hen_Ogledd \"Hen Ogledd\"), in parts of what have become southern\nScotland and northern England, and by the 7th or 8th centuries, had apparently\ncome under the political control of the Anglo-Saxons.[9]\n\nBy the mid-9th century, Anglo-Saxon England was divided into four separate and\nindependent kingdoms; [East Anglia](/wiki/Kingdom_of_East_Anglia \"Kingdom of\nEast Anglia\"), [Wessex](/wiki/Wessex \"Wessex\"),\n[Northumbria](/wiki/Northumbria \"Northumbria\"), and [Mercia](/wiki/Mercia\n\"Mercia\"), the latter of which was the strongest military power.[10] Between\nhalf a million and a million people lived in England at this time, with\nsociety being rigidly hierarchical. This class system had a king and his\n[ealdormen](/wiki/Ealdormen \"Ealdormen\") at the top, under whom were the\n[thegns](/wiki/Thegns \"Thegns\"), or landholders, and then the various forms of\nagricultural workers below them. Beneath all of these was a class of slaves,\nwho may have made up as much as a quarter of the population.[10] The majority\nof the populace lived in the countryside, although a few large towns had\ndeveloped, namely [London](/wiki/London \"London\") and [York](/wiki/York\n\"York\"), which were centres of royal and ecclesiastical administration. There\nwas also a number of trading ports, such as [Hamwic](/wiki/Hamwic \"Hamwic\")\nand [Ipswich](/wiki/Ipswich \"Ipswich\"), where foreign trade took place .[10]\n\n###\nScandinavia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Scandinavia\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Reconstructed_Viking_longboat_%22Hugin%22.jpg/220px-\nReconstructed_Viking_longboat_%22Hugin%22.jpg)](/wiki/File:Reconstructed_Viking_longboat_%22Hugin%22.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Reconstructed_Viking_longboat_%22Hugin%22.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA 20th century replica of a Viking longship, known as the\n_[Hugin](/wiki/Hugin_\\(longship\\) \"Hugin \\(longship\\)\")_\n\nSociety in 8th century Scandinavia was, unlike parts of the British Isles,\nstill pre-literate, existing in the final stages of European\n[prehistory](/wiki/Prehistory \"Prehistory\"), known to archaeologists as the\n[Iron Age](/wiki/Iron_Age_Scandinavia \"Iron Age Scandinavia\"). In Scandinavia,\nthe 8th century proved to be \"a period of rapid technological, economic and\nsocial development\" which would lead the region out of the Iron Age and into\nwhat has come to be known as the [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age \"Viking\nAge\").[11]\n\nAt the start of the Early Mediaeval period, the Norse populations saw\nthemselves primarily as inhabitants of specific locations, such as\n[Jutland](/wiki/Jutland \"Jutland\"), [Vestfold](/wiki/Vestfold \"Vestfold\") and\n[Hordaland](/wiki/Hordaland \"Hordaland\"). It would only be in the later\ncenturies that the national identities would develop amongst the\nScandinavians, dividing them into such national groups as the\n[Danes](/wiki/Danes \"Danes\"), [Swedes](/wiki/Swedes \"Swedes\") and\n[Norwegians](/wiki/Norwegians \"Norwegians\").[12]\n\nThe Late Iron Age peoples of Scandinavia had not yet been converted to\nChristianity as the peoples of Britain and Ireland had, and instead followed\n[Norse paganism](/wiki/Norse_paganism \"Norse paganism\"), a polytheistic set of\nbeliefs that revered such deities as [Odin](/wiki/Odin \"Odin\"),\n[Thor](/wiki/Thor \"Thor\"), [Frey](/wiki/Frey \"Frey\") and [Freyja](/wiki/Freyja\n\"Freyja\").[13]\n\nScandinavian society was heavily dependent on fishing herring, and when that\nfailed, the seafaring Norse sailors turned to navigating around much of Europe\nduring the Early Mediaeval period.[14] The Norse populations of Scandinavia\nhad developed trade links with many areas of Europe, obtaining large\nquantities of gold in the late 5th century, most of which had been found in\nSweden, and to a lesser extent, Norway.[4]\n\n## Viking raids: 793–850\nAD[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Viking raids: 793–850 AD\")]\n\nIn the final decade of the 8th century AD, Norse raiders attacked a series of\nChristian monasteries located in the British Isles. In the British Isles,\nChristian monasteries had often been positioned on small islands and in other\nremote coastal areas so that the monks could dwell there in seclusion,\ndevoting themselves to worship without the interference of other elements of\nsociety. At the same time, it made them isolated and unprotected targets for\nattack.[15] Historian [Peter Hunter Blair](/wiki/Peter_Hunter_Blair \"Peter\nHunter Blair\") remarked that the Viking raiders would have been astonished \"at\nfinding so many communities which housed considerable wealth and whose\ninhabitants carried no arms.\"[15] These raids would have been the first\ncontact many Norsemen had with Christianity, but such attacks were not\nspecifically anti-Christian in nature, rather the monasteries were simply seen\nas 'easy targets' for raiders.[13]\n\nLo, it is nearly 350 years that we and our fathers have inhabited this most\nlovely land, and never before has such a terror appeared as we have now\nsuffered from a pagan race, nor was it thought that such an inroad from the\nsea could be made. Behold the church of St Cuthbert spattered with the blood\nof the priests of God, despoiled of all its ornaments.\n\nArchbishop [Alcuin of York](/wiki/Alcuin_of_York \"Alcuin of York\") on the\nsacking of Lindisfarne.[16]\n\nThe first known account of a Viking raid taking place in Anglo-Saxon England\ncomes from 789, when three ships from [Hordaland](/wiki/Hordaland \"Hordaland\")\n(in modern Norway) landed in the [Isle of Portland](/wiki/Isle_of_Portland\n\"Isle of Portland\") on the southern coast of Wessex. They were approached by\nthe royal reeve from [Dorchester](/wiki/Dorchester,_Dorset \"Dorchester,\nDorset\"), whose job it was to identify all foreign merchants entering the\nkingdom, and they proceeded to kill him.[16] It is likely that other raids\n(the records for which have since been lost) occurred soon after, for in 792\nKing [Offa of Mercia](/wiki/Offa_of_Mercia \"Offa of Mercia\") began to make\narrangements for the defence of Kent from raids perpetrated by \"pagan\npeoples\".[16]\n\nThe next recorded attack against the Anglo-Saxons came the following year, in\n793, when the monastery at [Lindisfarne](/wiki/Lindisfarne \"Lindisfarne\"), an\nisland off England's eastern coast, was sacked by a Viking raiding party on 8\nJune.[16] The following year they sacked the nearby [Monkwearmouth-Jarrow\nAbbey](/wiki/Monkwearmouth-Jarrow_Abbey \"Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey\").[5]\n\nIn 795 they once again attacked, this time raiding [Iona\nAbbey](/wiki/Iona_Abbey \"Iona Abbey\") on Scotland's west coast.[5] This\nmonastery would be attacked again in 802 and 806, when 68 people dwelling\nthere were killed. Following such devastation, the monastic community at Iona\nabandoned the site and fled instead to [Kells](/wiki/Kells,_County_Meath\n\"Kells, County Meath\") in Ireland.[17]\n\nIn the first decade of the 9th century AD, Viking raiders began to attack\ncoastal districts along Ireland.[18] In 835, the first major Viking raid in\nsouthern England took place and was directed against the [Isle of\nSheppey](/wiki/Isle_of_Sheppey \"Isle of Sheppey\").[19]\n\n### Treasure\nhoards[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Treasure hoards\")]\n\nVarious [hoards](/wiki/Hoards \"Hoards\") of treasure were buried in England at\nthis time, some of which may have been deposited by Anglo-Saxons attempting to\nhide their wealth from Viking raiders, and some of which may have instead been\nburied by the Viking raiders themselves as a way of protecting their looted\ntreasure.[16]\n\nOne of these hoards, discovered in [Croydon](/wiki/Croydon \"Croydon\")\n(historically part of [Surrey](/wiki/Surrey \"Surrey\"), now part of [Greater\nLondon](/wiki/Greater_London \"Greater London\")) in 1862, contained 250 coins,\nthree silver ingots and part of a fourth as well as four pieces of hack silver\nin a linen bag. Archaeologists interpret this as loot collected by a member of\nthe Viking army. By dating the artefacts, archaeologists came to believe that\nit was likely that this hoard had been buried in 872, when the army wintered\nin London.[16] The coins themselves came from a wide range of different\nkingdoms, with Wessex, Mercian and East Anglian examples found alongside\nforeign imports from [Carolingian-dynasty](/wiki/Carolingian_dynasty\n\"Carolingian dynasty\") [Francia](/wiki/Francia \"Francia\") and from the Arab\nworld.[16] Not all such Viking hoards in England contain coins, however – for\nexample, at [Bowes Moor](/wiki/Bowes_Moor \"Bowes Moor\"),\n[Durham](/wiki/Durham,_England \"Durham, England\"), 19 silver ingots were\ndiscovered, whilst at Orton Scar, [Cumbria](/wiki/Cumbria \"Cumbria\"), a silver\nneck-ring and penannular brooch were uncovered.[20]\n\nThe historian Peter Hunter Blair believed that the success of the Viking raids\nand the \"complete unpreparedness of Britain to meet such attacks\" became major\nfactors in the subsequent Norse invasions and colonisation of large parts of\nthe British Isles.[15]\n\n## Invasion and Danelaw:\n865–896[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Invasion and Danelaw: 865–896\")]\n\nFrom 865 the Norse attitude towards the British Isles changed, as they began\nto see it as a place for potential colonisation rather than simply a place to\nraid. As a result of this, larger armies began arriving on Britain's shores,\nwith the intention of conquering land and constructing settlements there.[21]\n\n###\nEngland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: England\")]\n\nMain article: [Danelaw](/wiki/Danelaw \"Danelaw\")\n\n[show]\n\n  * [v](/wiki/Template:Campaignbox_Viking_invasions_of_England \"Template:Campaignbox Viking invasions of England\")\n  * [t](/wiki/Template_talk:Campaignbox_Viking_invasions_of_England \"Template talk:Campaignbox Viking invasions of England\")\n  * [e](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Campaignbox_Viking_invasions_of_England&action=edit)\n\nViking invasions of England  \n---  \n  \n_[Great Heathen Army](/wiki/Great_Heathen_Army \"Great Heathen Army\") (865–78)_\n\n  * [Englefield](/wiki/Battle_of_Englefield \"Battle of Englefield\")\n  * [Reading](/wiki/Battle_of_Reading_\\(871\\) \"Battle of Reading \\(871\\)\")\n  * [Ashdown](/wiki/Battle_of_Ashdown \"Battle of Ashdown\")\n  * [Basing](/wiki/Battle_of_Basing \"Battle of Basing\")\n  * [Marton](/wiki/Battle_of_Marton \"Battle of Marton\")\n  * [Edington/Ethandun](/wiki/Battle_of_Edington \"Battle of Edington\")\n  * [Cynwit](/wiki/Battle_of_Cynwit \"Battle of Cynwit\")\n\n_[The Danelaw](/wiki/Danelaw \"Danelaw\")_\n\n  * [Buttington](/wiki/Battle_of_Buttington \"Battle of Buttington\")\n  * [First Stamford](/wiki/Battle_of_Stamford_894 \"Battle of Stamford 894\")\n  * [The Holme](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Holme \"Battle of the Holme\")\n  * [Tettenhall](/wiki/Battle_of_Tettenhall \"Battle of Tettenhall\")\n  * [Tempsford](/wiki/Battle_of_Tempsford \"Battle of Tempsford\")\n  * [Derby](/wiki/Battle_of_Derby \"Battle of Derby\")\n  * [Second Stamford](/wiki/Battle_of_Stamford_918 \"Battle of Stamford 918\")\n  * [Corbridge](/wiki/Battle_of_Corbridge \"Battle of Corbridge\")\n  * [Brunanburh](/wiki/Battle_of_Brunanburh \"Battle of Brunanburh\")\n  * [Stainmore](/wiki/Battle_of_Stainmore \"Battle of Stainmore\")\n  * [Maldon](/wiki/Battle_of_Maldon \"Battle of Maldon\")\n  * [First Alton](/wiki/First_Battle_of_Alton \"First Battle of Alton\")\n  * [St Brice's Day](/wiki/St._Brice%27s_Day_massacre \"St. Brice's Day massacre\")\n  * [Pinhoe](/wiki/Battle_of_Pinhoe \"Battle of Pinhoe\")\n  * [Ringmere](/wiki/Battle_of_Ringmere \"Battle of Ringmere\")\n\n_[Cnut's invasion](/wiki/Cnut_the_Great#Conquest_of_England \"Cnut the Great\")\n(1015–16)_\n\n  * [Assandun](/wiki/Battle_of_Assandun \"Battle of Assandun\")\n  * [Brentford](/wiki/Battle_of_Brentford_\\(1016\\) \"Battle of Brentford \\(1016\\)\")\n\n_[Harald's invasion](/wiki/Harald_Hardrada#Invasion_of_England \"Harald\nHardrada\") (1066)_\n\n  * [Fulford](/wiki/Battle_of_Fulford \"Battle of Fulford\")\n  * [Stamford Bridge](/wiki/Battle_of_Stamford_Bridge \"Battle of Stamford Bridge\")\n\n  \n  \nIn 866, Norse armies captured York, one of the two major cities in Anglo-Saxon\nEngland.[21] In 871, King [Æthelred of Wessex](/wiki/%C3%86thelred_of_Wessex\n\"Æthelred of Wessex\"), who had been leading the conflict against the Vikings,\ndied and was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, [Alfred the\nGreat](/wiki/Alfred_the_Great \"Alfred the Great\").[21] Meanwhile, many Anglo-\nSaxon kings began to capitulate to the Viking demands, and handed over land to\nthe invading Norse settlers. In 876, the Northumbrian monarch\n[Healfdene](/wiki/Healfdene \"Healfdene\") gave up his lands to them, and in the\nnext four years they gained further land in the kingdoms of Mercia and East\nAnglia as well.[21] King Alfred continued his conflict with the invading\nforces, but was driven back into [Somerset](/wiki/Somerset \"Somerset\") in the\nsouth-west of his kingdom in 878, where he was forced to take refuge in the\nmarshes of [Athelney](/wiki/Athelney \"Athelney\").[21]\n\nAlfred regrouped his military forces and defeated the armies of the Norse\nmonarch of East Anglia, [Guthrum](/wiki/Guthrum \"Guthrum\"), at the [Battle of\nEdington](/wiki/Battle_of_Edington \"Battle of Edington\"). Following Guthrum's\ndefeat, in 886 the [Treaty of Wedmore](/wiki/Treaty_of_Wedmore \"Treaty of\nWedmore\") was signed between the (Norse-controlled) East Anglian and Wessex\ngovernments that established a boundary between the two kingdoms. The area to\nthe north and east of this boundary became known as the\n[Danelaw](/wiki/Danelaw \"Danelaw\") because it was under the control of Norse\npolitical influence, whilst those areas south and west of it remained under\nAnglo-Saxon dominance.[21] Alfred's government set about constructing a series\nof defended towns or _burhs_ , began the construction of a navy and organised\na militia system whereby half of his peasant army remained on active\nservice.[21] Although there were continuous attacks on Wessex by new Viking\narmies, the kingdom's new defences proved a success and in 896 the invaders\ndispersed, instead settling in East Anglia and Northumbria, with some instead\nsailing to [Normandy](/wiki/Normandy \"Normandy\").[21]\n\nAlfred's policy of opposing the Viking settlers was continued under the regime\nof his daughter [Æthelflæd](/wiki/%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d \"Æthelflæd\"), who\nmarried [Æthelred, Ealdorman of\nMercia](/wiki/%C3%86thelred,_Ealdorman_of_Mercia \"Æthelred, Ealdorman of\nMercia\"), and also under the regime of her brother [Edward the\nElder](/wiki/Edward_the_Elder \"Edward the Elder\"). In 920 the Northumbrian\ngovernment and the Scots governments both submitted to the military power of\nWessex, and in 937 the [Battle of Brunanburh](/wiki/Battle_of_Brunanburh\n\"Battle of Brunanburh\") led to the collapse of Norse power in northern\nBritain. In 954 [Erik Bloodaxe](/wiki/Erik_Bloodaxe \"Erik Bloodaxe\"), the last\nNorse King of York, was expelled from the city.[22]\n\n### Norse settlement in the British\nIsles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Norse settlement in the British Isles\")]\n\nThe early Norse settlers in Anglo-Saxon England would have appeared visibly\ndifferent from the Anglo-Saxon populace, wearing specifically Scandinavian\nstyles of jewellery, and probably also wearing their own peculiar styles of\nclothing as well. There was also a difference in the style of hair worn by\nNorse and Anglo-Saxon men, with the former typically wearing a hair style that\nwas shaved at the back and left shaggy on the front, whilst in contrast to\nthis the latter typically wore their hair long.[23]\n\n## Second invasion:\n980–1012[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Second invasion: 980–1012\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Knutrike.png/220px-\nKnutrike.png)](/wiki/File:Knutrike.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Knutrike.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Cnut the Great](/wiki/Cnut_the_Great \"Cnut the Great\")'s domains, in red\n\n###\nEngland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: England\")]\n\nUnder the reign of Wessex King [Edgar the Peaceful](/wiki/Edgar_the_Peaceful\n\"Edgar the Peaceful\"), England came to be further politically unified, with\nEdgar coming to be recognized as the king of all England by both Anglo-Saxon\nand Norse populations living in the country.[24] However, under the regimes of\nhis son [Edward the Martyr](/wiki/Edward_the_Martyr \"Edward the Martyr\"), who\nwas murdered in 978, and then [Æthelred the\nUnready](/wiki/%C3%86thelred_the_Unready \"Æthelred the Unready\"), the\npolitical strength of the English monarchy waned, and in 980 Viking raiders\nfrom Scandinavia once more started making attacks against England.[24] The\nEnglish government decided that the only way of dealing with these attackers\nwas to pay them [protection money](/wiki/Protection_money \"Protection money\"),\nand so in 991 they gave them £10,000. This fee did not prove to be enough, and\nover the next decade the English kingdom was forced to pay the Viking\nattackers increasingly large sums of money.[24] Many English began to demand\nthat a more hostile approach be taken against the Vikings, and so, on [St\nBrice's Day](/w/index.php?title=St_Brice%27s_Day&action=edit&redlink=1 \"St\nBrice's Day \\(page does not exist\\)\") in 1002, King Æthelred proclaimed that\nall Danes living in England would be executed. It would come to be known as\nthe [St. Brice's Day massacre](/wiki/St._Brice%27s_Day_massacre \"St. Brice's\nDay massacre\").[24]\n\nThe news of the massacre reached King [Sweyn Forkbeard](/wiki/Sweyn_Forkbeard\n\"Sweyn Forkbeard\") in Denmark. It is believed that Sweyn's sister\n[Gunhilde](/wiki/Gunhilde \"Gunhilde\") could have been among the victims, which\nprompted Sweyn to raid England the following year where Exeter was burned\ndown. Hampshire, Wiltshire, Wilton and Salisbury also became victims to the\nviking revenge attack. Sweyn continued his raid in England and in 1004 his\nviking army looted East Anglia, plundered Thetford and sacked Norwich, before\nhe once again returned to Denmark.\n\nFurther raids took place in 1006–1007, and in 1009–1012 [Thorkell the\nTall](/wiki/Thorkell_the_Tall \"Thorkell the Tall\") led a Viking invasion into\nEngland.\n\nIn 1013 [Sweyn Forkbeard](/wiki/Sweyn_Forkbeard \"Sweyn Forkbeard\") returned to\ninvade England with a large army, and Æthelred fled to Normandy, leading Sweyn\nto take the English throne. Sweyn died within a year however, and so Æthelred\nreturned, but in 1016 another Norse army invaded, this time under the control\nof the Danish King [Cnut](/wiki/Cnut \"Cnut\") son of [Sweyn\nForkbeard](/wiki/Sweyn_Forkbeard \"Sweyn Forkbeard\").[25] After defeating\nAnglo–Saxon forces at the [Battle of Assandun](/wiki/Battle_of_Assandun\n\"Battle of Assandun\"), Cnut became king of England, subsequently ruling over\nboth the Danish and English kingdoms.[25] Following Cnut's death in 1035, the\ntwo kingdoms were once more declared independent and remained so apart from a\nshort period from 1040 to 1042 when Cnut's son [Harthacnut](/wiki/Harthacnut\n\"Harthacnut\") ascended the English throne.[25]\n\n## Invasions of\n1066[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Invasions of 1066\")]\n\nThe [Battle of Fulford](/wiki/Battle_of_Fulford \"Battle of Fulford\") took\nplace at Fulford near [York](/wiki/York \"York\"), on 20 September 1066, when an\ninvading Norwegian force led by King [Harald Hardrada](/wiki/Harald_Hardrada\n\"Harald Hardrada\") of Norway and [Tostig Godwinson](/wiki/Tostig_Godwinson\n\"Tostig Godwinson\"), his English ally, fought and defeated the Northern Earls\n[Edwin](/wiki/Edwin,_Earl_of_Mercia \"Edwin, Earl of Mercia\") and\n[Morcar](/wiki/Morcar \"Morcar\"). When King [Harold II of\nEngland](/wiki/Harold_II_of_England \"Harold II of England\") heard of this\ndefeat he marched his English army from the south coast of England to meet the\nNorwegians at [Stamford\nBridge](/wiki/Stamford_Bridge,_East_Riding_of_Yorkshire \"Stamford Bridge, East\nRiding of Yorkshire\").[26]\n\nThe [Battle of Stamford Bridge](/wiki/Battle_of_Stamford_Bridge \"Battle of\nStamford Bridge\") took place near the village of Stamford, East Riding of\nYorkshire in England on 25 September 1066. The Norwegian invasion was repelled\nbut before the English Army had fully recovered, the Normans—under the\nleadership of Duke William II of Normandy ([William the\nConqueror](/wiki/William_the_Conqueror \"William the Conqueror\"))—invaded\nAnglo-Saxon England. William defeated Harold II of England's army at the\n[Battle of Hastings](/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings \"Battle of Hastings\").\n\n##\nEvidence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Evidence\")]\n\n### Written\nrecords[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Written records\")]\n\nArchaeologists James Graham-Campbell and Colleen E. Batey noted that there was\na lack of historical sources discussing the earliest Viking encounters with\nthe British Isles, which would have most probably been amongst the northern\nisland groups, those closest to Scandinavia.[27]\n\nThe _[Irish Annals](/wiki/Irish_Annals \"Irish Annals\")_ provide us with\naccounts of much Norse activity during the 9th and 10th centuries.[28]\n\nThe Viking raids that affected Anglo-Saxon England were primarily documented\nin the _[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle](/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle \"Anglo-Saxon\nChronicle\")_ , a collection of annals initially written in the late 9th\ncentury, most probably in the Kingdom of Wessex during the reign of [Alfred\nthe Great](/wiki/Alfred_the_Great \"Alfred the Great\"). The _Chronicle_ is\nhowever a biased source, acting as a piece of \"wartime propaganda\" written on\nbehalf of the Anglo-Saxon forces against their Norse opponents, and in many\ncases greatly exaggerates the size of the Norse fleets and armies, thereby\nmaking any Anglo-Saxon victories against them seem more heroic.[29]\n\n### Archaeological\nevidence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Archaeological evidence\")]\n\nThe Norse settlers in the British Isles left remains of their [material\nculture](/wiki/Material_culture \"Material culture\") behind, which\n[archaeologists](/wiki/Archaeology \"Archaeology\") have been able to\n[excavate](/wiki/Excavation_\\(archaeology\\) \"Excavation \\(archaeology\\)\") and\ninterpret during the 20th and 21st centuries. Such Norse evidence in Britain\nconsists primarily of Norse burials undertaken in Shetland, Orkney, the\nWestern Isles, the Isle of Man, Ireland and the north-west of England.[28]\nArchaeologists James Graham-Campbell and Colleen E. Batey remarked that it was\non the Isle of Man where Norse archaeology was \"remarkably rich in quality and\nquantity\".[3]\n\nHowever, as archaeologist [Julian D. Richards](/wiki/Julian_D._Richards\n\"Julian D. Richards\") commented, Scandinavians in Anglo-Saxon England \"can be\nelusive to the archaeologist\" because many of their houses and graves are\nindistinguishable from those of the other populations living in the\ncountry.[2] For this reason, historian Peter Hunter Blair noted that in\nBritain, the archaeological evidence for Norse invasion and settlement was\n\"very slight compared with the corresponding evidence for the Anglo-Saxon\ninvasions\" of the 5th century.[28]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Kingdom of the Isles](/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Isles \"Kingdom of the Isles\")\n  * [Scandinavian Scotland](/wiki/Scandinavian_Scotland \"Scandinavian Scotland\")\n  * [Orkney](/wiki/Orkney \"Orkney\")\n  * [Earldom of Orkney](/wiki/Earldom_of_Orkney \"Earldom of Orkney\")\n  * [History of Shetland](/wiki/History_of_Shetland \"History of Shetland\")\n  * [Orkneyinga saga](/wiki/Orkneyinga_saga \"Orkneyinga saga\")\n  * [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age \"Viking Age\")\n  * [Category:Norse activity in Scotland](/wiki/Category:Norse_activity_in_Scotland \"Category:Norse activity in Scotland\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n###\nFootnotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Footnotes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Keynes 1999. p. 460.\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Richards 1991. p. 9.\n  3. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 3.\n  4. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Blair 2003. pp. 56–57.\n  5. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Blair 2003. p. 55.\n  6. **Jump up ^** Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 5.\n  7. **Jump up ^** Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. pp. 5–7.\n  8. **Jump up ^** Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. pp. 14–16.\n  9. **Jump up ^** Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 18.\n  10. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Richards 1991. p. 13.\n  11. **Jump up ^** Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 1.\n  12. **Jump up ^** Richards 1991. p. 11.\n  13. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 32.\n  14. **Jump up ^** Richards 1991. p. 12.\n  15. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Blair 2003. p. 63.\n  16. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ Richards 1991. p. 16.\n  17. **Jump up ^** Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 24.\n  18. **Jump up ^** Blair 2003. p. 66.\n  19. **Jump up ^** Blair 2003. p. 68.\n  20. **Jump up ^** Richards 1991. p. 17.\n  21. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ _**h**_ Richards 1991. p. 20.\n  22. **Jump up ^** Richards 1991. p. 22.\n  23. **Jump up ^** Richards 1991. pp. 11–12.\n  24. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ Richards 1991. p. 24.\n  25. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Richards 1991. p. 28.\n  26. **Jump up ^** DeVries. _The Norwegian Invasion_. pp. 255–59.\n  27. **Jump up ^** Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 2.\n  28. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Blair 2003. p. 64.\n  29. **Jump up ^** Richards 1991. p. 15.\n\n###\nBibliography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Bibliography\")]\n\n  * Blair, Peter Hunter (2003). _An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England_ (Third Edition).
