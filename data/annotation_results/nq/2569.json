        "# Land Ordinance of 1785\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe **Land Ordinance of 1785** was adopted by the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") [Congress of the\nConfederation](/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation \"Congress of the\nConfederation\") on May 20, 1785. It set up a standardized system whereby\nsettlers could purchase title to farmland in the undeveloped west. Congress at\nthe time did not have the power to raise revenue by direct taxation, so land\nsales provided an important revenue stream. The Ordinance set up a survey\nsystem that eventually covered over three-fourths of the area of the\ncontinental United States.[1]\n\nThe earlier [Ordinance of 1784](/wiki/Ordinance_of_1784 \"Ordinance of 1784\")\nwas a resolution written by [Thomas Jefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas\nJefferson\") (delegate from Virginia) calling for Congress to take action. The\nland west of the [Appalachian Mountains](/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains\n\"Appalachian Mountains\"), north of the [Ohio River](/wiki/Ohio_River \"Ohio\nRiver\") and east of the [Mississippi River](/wiki/Mississippi_River\n\"Mississippi River\") was to be divided into ten separate states.[2] However,\nthe 1784 resolution did not define the mechanism by which the land would\nbecome states, or how the territories would be governed or settled before they\nbecame states. The Ordinance of 1785 put the 1784 resolution in operation by\nproviding a mechanism for selling and settling the land,[3] while the\n[Northwest Ordinance](/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance \"Northwest Ordinance\") of 1787\naddressed political needs.\n\nThe 1785 ordinance laid the foundations of land policy until passage of the\n[Homestead Act](/wiki/Homestead_Act \"Homestead Act\") in 1862. The Land\nOrdinance established the basis for the [Public Land Survey\nSystem](/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System \"Public Land Survey System\"). The\ninitial surveying was performed by [Thomas Hutchins](/wiki/Thomas_Hutchins\n\"Thomas Hutchins\"). After he died in 1789, responsibility for surveying was\ntransferred to the Surveyor General. Land was to be systematically surveyed\ninto square [townships](/wiki/Survey_township \"Survey township\"), six miles\n(9.656 km) on a side. Each of these townships were sub-divided into thirty-six\n[sections](/wiki/Section_\\(United_States_land_surveying\\) \"Section \\(United\nStates land surveying\\)\") of one square mile (2.59 km²) or 640\n[acres](/wiki/Acres \"Acres\"). These sections could then be further subdivided\nfor re-sale by settlers and land speculators.[4]\n\nThe ordinance was also significant for establishing a mechanism for funding\npublic education. Section 16 in each township was reserved for the maintenance\nof public schools. Many schools today are still located in section sixteen of\ntheir respective townships[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_], although a great many of the school sections\nwere sold to raise money for public education. In later States, section 36 of\neach township was also designated as a \"school section\".[5][6][7]\n\nThe [Point of Beginning](/wiki/Beginning_Point_of_the_U.S._Public_Land_Survey\n\"Beginning Point of the U.S. Public Land Survey\") for the 1785 survey was\nwhere Ohio (as the easternmost part of the Northwest Territory),\n[Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\") and\n[Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\") (now [West Virginia](/wiki/West_Virginia\n\"West Virginia\")) met, on the north shore of the [Ohio River](/wiki/Ohio_River\n\"Ohio River\") near [East Liverpool, Ohio](/wiki/East_Liverpool,_Ohio \"East\nLiverpool, Ohio\").

After debate and amendment, the\nordinance was reported to Congress April 26, 1785. It required surveyors “to\ndivide the said territory into townships seven miles square, by lines running\ndue north and south, and others crossing these at right angles. — The plats of\nthe townships, respectively, shall be marked into sections of one mile square,\nor 640 acres.” This is the first recorded use of the terms “township” and\n“section.”[9]\n\nOn May 3, 1785, [William Grayson](/wiki/William_Grayson \"William Grayson\") of\nVirginia made a motion seconded by [James Monroe](/wiki/James_Monroe \"James\nMonroe\") to change “seven miles square” to “six miles square.” The ordinance\nwas passed on May 20, 1785.

The law of 1785 embraced most of the new system.[14] Treat,\non the other hand, notes that tiers of townships were familiar in New England,\nand insisted on by the New England legislators.[15]\n\n## Public\neducation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_Ordinance_of_1785&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Public education\")]\n\n  * Public Education in Land Grants in the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 Background:*\n\nThe Land Ordinance of 1785, adopted May 20, 1785 by the Continental Congress,\nset the stage for an organized and community-based westward expansion in the\nUnited States in the years after the American Revolution. The Land Ordinance\nof 1785, coming on the heels of the Ordinance of 1784, was the effort of a\nfive-person committee led by Thomas Jefferson. The ordinance established a\nsystematic and ubiquitous process for surveying, planning and selling\ntownships in the western frontier. [There is no reference to \"Education\" in\nthis section - other than the title. It should be removed, or updated and\nproperly cited.]\n\n## Layout of\ntownships[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_Ordinance_of_1785&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Layout of townships\")]\n\nEach western township contained thirty-six square miles of land, planned as a\nsquare measuring six miles on each side, which was further subdivided into\nthirty six lots, each lot containing one square mile of land. The mathematical\nprecision of the planning was the concerted effort of surveyors. Each township\ncontained dedicated space for public education and other government uses, as\nfive of the thirty six lots were reserved for government or public purposes.\nThe thirty six lots of each township were numbered accordingly on each\ntownship's survey. The centermost land of each township corresponded to lot\nnumbers 15, 16, 21 and 22 on the township survey, with lot number 16 dedicated\nspecifically to public education. As the Land Ordinance of 1785 stated: \"There\nshall be reserved the lot No. 16, of every township, for the maintenance of\npublic schools within the said township.\"[16]\n\nKnepper notes: “Sections number 8, 11, 26, and 29 in every township were\nreserved for future sale by the federal government when, it was hoped, they\nwould bring higher prices because of developed land around them. Congress also\nreserved one third part of all gold, silver, lead, and copper mines to its own\nuse, a bit of wishful thinking as regards Ohio lands.”[17] The ordinance also\nsaid “That three townships adjacent to [Lake Erie](/wiki/Lake_Erie \"Lake\nErie\") be reserved, to be hereafter disposed of by Congress, for the use of\nthe officers, men, and others, refugees from [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\"),\nand the refugees from [Nova Scotia](/wiki/Nova_Scotia \"Nova Scotia\"), who are\nor may be entitled to grants of land under resolutions of Congress now\nexisting.“ This was not possible, as the area next to Lake Erie was [property\nof Connecticut](/wiki/Connecticut_Western_Reserve \"Connecticut Western\nReserve\"), so the Canadians had to wait until the establishment of the\n[Refugee Tract](/wiki/Refugee_Tract \"Refugee Tract\") in 1798.[18]\n\n##\nInfluence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_Ordinance_of_1785&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Influence\")]\n\nMany historians recognize the influences of the colonial experience in the\nland ordinances of the 1780s.[19] The committees that formulated these\nordinances were inspired by the individual colonial experiences of the states\nthat they represented. The committees attempted to implement the best\npractices of such states to solve the task at hand.[20] The surveyed townships\nof the Land Ordinance of 1785, writes historian Jonathan Hughes, “represented\nan amalgam of the colonial experience and ideals.”[21] Two geographically and\nideologically distinct colonial land systems were competing at such time in\nhistory – the New England system and the Southern system.[20] While the\nprimary influence on the Land Ordinance of 1785 was the New England land\nsystem of the colonial era, marked by its emphasis on community development\nand systematic planning, the exceedingly individualistic Southern land system\nalso played a role.\n\nEven though Jefferson’s committee had a Southern majority, it recommended the\nNew England survey system.[22] The highly planned and surveyed western\ntownships established in the Land Ordinance of 1785, were heavily influenced\nby the New England settlements of the colonial era, particularly the land\ngrant provisions of the Ordinances which dedicated land towards public\neducation and other government uses. In colonial times, New England\nsettlements contained dedicated public space for schools and churches, which\noften held a central role in the community. For instance, the 1751 royal\ncharter for Marlboro Vermont provides: “one Shear [share] for the First\nSettled Minister one Shear for the benefit of the School forever.”[23] By time\nof the Land Ordinance of 1785 was enacted, the New England states had used\nland grants for over a century to support public education and build new\nschools. The clause in the Land Ordinance of 1785 which dedicated “Lot Number\n16” of each western township for public education reflected this regional New\nEngland experience.[24]\n\nIn addition, the use of surveyors to precisely chart out the new townships in\nthe westward expansion was directly influenced by the New England land system,\nwhich similarly relied on surveyors and local committees to clearly delineate\nproperty boundaries. Defined property boundary lines and an established land\ntitle system, provided colonials with a sense of security in their land\nownership, by minimizing the likelihood of ownership or boundary disputes.\nThis was an important consideration in the Land Ordinance of 1785. One of the\nprimary purposes of the Ordinance was to raise funds for the increasingly\ninsolvent government. Providing land speculators security in their purchases\nencouraged additional demand for the western lands. In addition, the organized\nand communal nature of the western settlements, allowed the government to\nreserve a number of well-defined plots of land for future government\ndevelopment. Since the rest of the township would have been developed by the\ntime the government decided to develop such reserved lands, there was an\nalready built-in assurance of land value appreciation for the reserved lands.\nThis had the effect of increasing the value of government assets without much\nfurther investment by the government.\n\nThe New England land system, while the primary influence on the great land\nordinances of the 1780s, was not the only land system influence. The Southern\nland system, marked by individualism and personal initiative, also helped\nshape the ordinance. While the New England land system was premised on\ncommunity-based development, the Southern land system was premised on\nindividual frontiersman appropriating undeveloped land to call their own. The\nSouthern pioneer claimed property and the local surveyor would demarcate it\nfor him. The system did not protect people from competing claims or set up an\norderly chain of title. The process was called ‘indiscriminate location”. This\nsystem encouraged individuals to amass large plantations instead of settling\ninto dense communal development. This system was supported by the use of slave\nlabor.[25] Perhaps the committee’s resistance against indiscriminate location\nand support for limited and disciplined land settlement was an implicit\nattempt to create a structural barrier to developing a plantation economy that\nwas dependent on slave labor. The committee could have been attempting to\neffectively eradicate slavery in the West after Jefferson failed to outlaw it\nin the Land Ordinance of 1784.\n\nWhile the Land Ordinance of 1785 created a New England style land system, the\nNorthwest Ordinance of 1787 determined how the townships would be\nadministered. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787, like the Land Ordinance of\n1785, was inspired by the New England colonial settlements, and manifested\nthis influence by further encouraging the worship of religion and the spread\nof education. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 stated, “Religion, morality, and\nknowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind,\nschools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.”[26] However,\nthe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also contained Southern characteristics of\nmunicipal governance. The Southern influence can be felt in the Western\ntownships in that once the federal land was dedicated to the particular\ntownship, the township was relatively free of the influence of the federal\ngovernment, and the local municipality was left to govern itself. This\nmanifested itself in public education as well. Once the land was dedicated,\nthe actual development of the public schools was the responsibility of the\nlocal township or the particular state.[27] Although the great Ordinances of\nthe 1780s set the framework for a national system of schools by dedicating\nland across the West, the devolved development and administration by the state\nand local government led to unique results.[28]\n\n##\nMotive[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_Ordinance_of_1785&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Motive\")]\n\nRetaining central land in each township ensured that these lands would create\nvalue for the federal government. Instead of disbursing funds to the new\nstates to create public education systems, dedicating a central lot in each\ntownship provided the new townships with the means to develop educational\ninstitutions without any transfer of funds. This was a practical and necessary\nway to achieve the committee’s goal in a pre-Constitution America. Aside from\nraising funds for a financially struggling government, the westward expansion\noutlined in the Land Ordinances of the 1780s also provided a framework for\nspreading democratic ideals. Jefferson proposed an article in the Ordinance of\n1784 that would have outlawed slavery in the new states after the year 1800.\nHowever he could not amass enough votes to pass the anti-slavery article.\nLater Jefferson did succeed, however, in ensuring public funding of education\nby dedicating land to education in the Land Ordinance of 1785. Public\neducation was an ideal already developed in the New England colonial\nsettlements. New Englanders provided for public education in their land grants\ndue to a belief that public education could be used to further unite the young\nnation and spread democratic ideals.[29]\n\nThe systematic and highly organized westward settlements, with their local\ngovernments and central square dedicated towards public education were a\nconcerted effort to inspire civic duty and participation in the democratic\nprocess. Usher relates this initiative to “the Supreme Court in Cooper v.\nRoberts (1855), ‘plant in the heart of every community the same sentiments of\ngrateful reverence for the wisdom, forecast, and magnanimous statesmanship of\nthose who framed the institutions of these new States.” [30] The westward\nexpansion therefore was not only a tool for raising much needed funds, but\nalso a tool in a grand socializing experiment to inoculate the settlers to\ndemocratic ideals. The hope was that the unique planning of each township with\na public school centrally located, coupled with the obligation of each\ntownship’s local citizens to take part in the civic process of governing the\ntownship, teaching and building the schools, and maintaining order, would\ninstill the democratic ideals crucial to the nation’s success.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_Ordinance_of_1785&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Northwest Ordinance](/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance \"Northwest Ordinance\")\n  * [Public Land Survey System](/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System \"Public Land Survey System\")\n  * [Northwest Territory](/wiki/Northwest_Territory \"Northwest Territory\")\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_Ordinance_of_1785&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Vernon Carstensen, \"Patterns on the American Land.\" _Journal of Federalism,_ (19870 18#4 pp 31–39\n  2. **Jump up ^** Richard P.
